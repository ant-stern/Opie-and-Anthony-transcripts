<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed "Homeless Shopping Spree 2," a chaotic event involving ten homeless individuals – Sperm, Tippi Tom, Rock Your Old Tommy, Blue, Buttered Roll, Snoop, Ziggy, Big Ed, Big Blue, and Andre – each given $100, food, beer, socks, and pornography.  The journey to Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island, on a bus equipped with video screens and a bathroom, was fraught with escalating debauchery.  Numerous on-site reports from show staff (Ben, Keith, Psycho Mark, Rick), guests Jim Norton and Rich Voss, and listeners painted a picture of unrestrained intoxication, violence, and bizarre behavior.  Tippi Tom, initially asleep, became aggressive upon waking, threatening violence and arguing over money. Rock Your Old Tommy attempted to light himself on fire. Blue engaged in sexually aggressive behavior towards a female staff member, Mary. Ziggy believed he was on an airplane.

The hosts, Opie and Anthony, in the studio, engaged in numerous phone calls with those on the bus, listeners, and mall security, debating the wisdom of providing beer (with Keith expressing concerns).  At least one beer was given to Rock Your Old Tommy, resulting in increased pandemonium.  Listeners reported a large caravan of vehicles following the bus and an increased police presence near the mall, with conflicting reports regarding the actual number of police and security personnel.  Sergeant Klain's concern over open containers led to a frantic attempt to hide empty bottles.

Upon arrival at the mall, the scene was described as utter chaos, with hundreds of people, many with cameras, creating a massive crowd chanting "Let the Homeless Shop!"  The event involved significant crowd participation.  The shopping spree itself was marked by various humorous and disruptive incidents involving the homeless participants and store staff.  Tommy jumped into a tub display at a bar. Some stores refused entry to the group. One individual attempted to leave without paying.  Despite challenges, the homeless individuals obtained clothing, electronics, and food.  Psycho Mark's drunken antics, including yelling, potentially losing his teeth, and attempting to rub his genitals against a CD collection, were a recurring theme.  Big Blue enjoyed a massage chair, and Ziggy celebrated a nice restroom.  Dippy Tom engaged in impromptu Christmas carol singing. One caller criticized the show as unfunny and unoriginal, while others offered both support and criticism.  The broadcast ended abruptly with the participants boarding the bus for the return to New York City, with three individuals unaccounted for.  A final caller reported at least 2,000 people at the mall exit cheering.  The hosts promised to share photos and videos online and continue the story the next day.  Privileged Night Club was a sponsor but their promised strippers did not appear.  Snoop, a former homeless individual helped by the show, called in to express gratitude.  The entire broadcast was punctuated by crude and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I feel like being an idiot Anthony. I'm a retard. The Opie and Anthony show. That thing's hilarious.  Put on your hockey helmets, kids. It's going to be a bumpy ride today.  Here we go. 
[00:00:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. No reason to waste time today. We've got to get right into the festivities.  Oh, no.  A couple phone numbers really fast in the New York area. 877-692-1027. Anywhere else, including Philadelphia.  Hey, how you doing, Philly?  Someone's listening to the Opie and Anthony show. Thank you, Philly. Thank you.  Very encouraging today from Philly. Thank you.  Uh, 866-277-4-WOW. That's 866-277-4-WOW. 
[00:01:00]  Well, um, time is of the essence, Opie.  Today, I'm hearing, uh, well, of course, today is the homeless shopping spree.  Homeless shopping spree 2.  2.  Happening today. Uh, the homeless are out on the bus in front of the station.  Right in front of the Brooklyn Diner.  And, uh, time is of the essence, because I hear some of them think, uh, that this is a big arrest.  Yeah.  And want to get off the bus.  Yeah.  Uh, they don't believe that people would be this charitable with money and beer and a shopping spree. 
[00:01:30]  Uh, so they think that it's a bus.  Everyone knows what's going on, right? We're bringing the homeless to a mall and they can spend their $100 any way they want.  Any way they damn well please.  And we've given them all sorts of stuff on top of that, including, like you said, the beer, the food, the beer, the food, the bus, the socks, all sorts of stuff.  And, of course, what, uh, what kind of, um, uh, movie or viewing, uh, pleasure do you give the homeless on their way to a mall?  Pornography.  They are watching, this bus is great.  It's a full-size bus like you would take to Atlantic City. 
[00:02:00]  Not a little mini bus, nothing.  It's a full-size bus.  There's a bathroom, which, I mean, has got to look like a daisy cutter hit it, uh, after they're done.  And, uh, video screens, uh, above the seats.  Yeah.  You know, they all get their own video screen.  Yeah.  And porno is playing on, so they're all revved up.  They're going to be humping people's legs like chihuahuas.  Yeah.  Uh, walking through the mall, they're all horned up.  That's what you need.  Horned up, drunk, homeless.  Anthony, very important.  Uh, the first pictures are up, uh, of the ten people that we will be bringing to one of the malls. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, fantastic.  Let me, uh, let me see.  You can go to three websites right now.  WNAW.com, opiananthony.com, or foundrymusic.com.  And, uh, there they are.  All Tom Lickin'.  You got Blue, and Tippy Tom, and Rock Your Old Tommy, and Sperm, and Snoop, Ziggy, Andre, Youngblood, Big Ed, and last but not least, Buttered Roll.  Is Buttered Roll really Earl?  Did he put a beard on?  Butter Roll looks like Earl? 
[00:03:00]  A little bit.  A little bit.  With a beard.  Of course, Ziggy.  Oh, my God.  I'm looking through all the, uh, pictures now.  We have a picture of the bus, and the head shots are up.  Yeah.  And, um, I, I don't think I met, I didn't see Sperm out there.  He's, he's on the bus, though?  Yeah, he's on the bus.  There he is.  Sperm's trying to get off the bus, because he's convinced that he's getting arrested.  Yeah.  And Rock and Roll Tommy, Rock and Roll.  Look at him.  Well, we got to go right to Ben, Anthony, because, um...  Geddy Lee with the him.  Yeah. 
[00:03:30]  Ben, uh, started the early, uh, started the day really early.  Yeah.  Because he had to help, uh, Keith.  Round up the homeless.  Round them up!  Well, it started last night, too, on the way out with these guys.  They, uh, they barfed in the garage.  Much of the...  Ah, last night.  Right in front of a bunch of customers, and then I was leaving work.  I go around the corner at, uh, Citibank, and all those CDs we gave them were on, were  on the ground.  That we gave Rock and Roll Tommy yesterday.  Yeah, he's, he's screaming, give me five bucks!  Give me five bucks!  To the people coming out of Citibank, and then he goes to me, he goes, Anthony? 
[00:04:00]  So I, I kept walking.  At that point, Tippi Tom was in the middle of, uh, Broadway.  Directing traffic.  So, uh, but then today, we started off, and I gotta hand it to Keith.  He really, I did a bang-up job with a bunch of winners.  Oh, absolutely, he did.  Well, the homeless, they were all on time, waiting for you guys to arrive.  Most of them, right?  The word got out on the street, Ed.  There were, like...  I heard there were, uh, some people, uh, that wanted to go that weren't on the list.  The only one that wasn't there was Ziggy.  He was, the rest were all there an hour early.  There's probably 15 or 20 of them still waiting on the corner, like... 
[00:04:30]  Really?  Hoping.  Hoping.  Hoping.  Hoping.  Hoping they could be a part of this special...  Special day.  Damn.  Now, then I hear Ziggy was on time, all of a sudden, right when he was supposed to be  there, he's walking across the street with his little bag.  Yeah.  For his little field trip today.  And they all know Ziggy.  He's like the, like the...  All of them know Ziggy, and they've got, like, some sort of respect to him.  It's like the funniest thing.  Oh, yeah.  Like, there's a whole hierarchy with, uh, with the homeless.  Of course, the rock and roll Tommy and Tippi Tom made their way to the bus, uh, last.  I saw them walking down the sidewalk. 
[00:05:00]  Psycho Mark had to go get them from the corner of Broadway and, uh, 57, where, uh, rock and  roll Tommy had his schlong hanging out and was taking a leak in the middle of Broadway.  Anyway, uh, he then had to be corralled up and brought back, and him and Tippi Tom, the  whole time, fighting.  Still fighting from, uh, last night.  From yesterday's show.  I couldn't imagine.  I woke up this morning, and the first thing that popped in my head was, I could not imagine  the hangover I would have if I was as intoxicated as Tippi Tom was yesterday. 
[00:05:30]  Thank God Tippi Tom passed out on the bus.  We'll wake him up when we get there.  Oh, he's passed out?  He's passed out?  Out of control.  Well, he'll wake up, and when rock and roll Tommy starts hitting him on the head, rock  and roll.  I heard the, uh, I heard the, uh, I heard the subway ride was pretty interesting, too.  I'm a deuce.  You're a deuce.  The subway ride was hilarious, because we, we had them all corralled, and Sparm's trying  to take off, so we have them in one cart, and people coming onto the train just fling.  Rock and roll Tommy and, uh, Tippi Tom just kept arguing, and they almost got in a couple 
[00:06:00]  fights, but he leaned over at one point, and this, uh, blonde lady bolted out of the train,  just got right out of the train.  There was, like, a tourist couple from, like, Iowa, and they were sitting there, and there  was maybe, like, three or four inches of space between rock and roll Tommy and this lady,  and Tippi Tom just squeezed his butt right in there, and she was, like, pressed up against  her husband.  Horrified.  And he was, like, leaning on her.  And that's a smelly bird.  Don't move, honey.  You look like a racist or something.  You look like somebody who doesn't have tolerance for these people. 
[00:06:30]  So they just sit there.  Meanwhile, in New York, he's like, get off of me, you smelly.  Holy ass.  Jay from Yonkers.  Butter roll.  Looks like the new Knick coach, Don Chaney.  Ah.  Also funny, on the subway ride, uh, Blue's standing up, and the subway train comes, like,  to a fast, fast stop, and Blue goes flying into about three people, and he's just hanging  on to them.  People are trying to push him off.  Well, he was great.  When he walked up to the bus, I saw, when he got his first look at the bus, it was like,  oh, man, this is a fat ride. 
[00:07:00]  And he goes, jumping inside.  Did we at least wipe the blood off his forehead, though?  Yeah, he's still bleeding.  Scott Kay, uh, saying Ziggy is like the Don Corleone of the homeless.  Pretty much.  They give him the respect.  You can see the Don.  You can see the pictures of the guys for yourself.  So, HopiAndAnthony.com or FoundryMusic.com.  So, uh, I guess we're ready to head off to a mall.  Oh, this is great.  Really fast.  Psycho Mark's on the bus.  He's going to help us out today with the festivities.  Psycho Mark.  My voice is all crap today, but we just broke up a fight between Blue and Tippy Tom. 
[00:07:30]  They're already fighting on the bus.  Now, why is Blue and Tippy Tom fighting?  Because they're applying drugs.  They're all alcoholics, and they're completely hungover.  When we picked them up this afternoon, Tippy Tom has a bottle of Thunderbird in his mouth,  and he's swinging it down like it's no tomorrow.  Oh, God.  It's Rick.  They're so drunk.  I don't know what you're doing this way.  They're not even going to remember the trip.  That's classic.  All right, Mark.  I've got to go, Rick.  We're going to get going.  Come on.  All right.  There are so many people going on this little trip today. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Rick, what's going on?  I can barely keep my eyes open, dude.  I hear the bus reeks.  The, uh, freaking, the bus reeks already.  This is going to be the worst trip.  Rick, I, uh, me and Hopi, we both walked on the bus before any of the homeless got that.  And I was amazed.  I go, this is a beautiful bus.  It's a gorgeous bus.  It smells great.  Uh, the bathroom was very clean and smelled fine.  And now you're saying that you haven't even gone anywhere yet, and it stinks.  I can't get past the second row of seats, man. 
[00:08:30]  Has anyone, um, has anyone used the bathroom yet?  Hey, any of you guys used the bathroom yet?  Yeah, I think it was Rock and Roll Tommy raised his hand.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Hey, do you want to talk to Blue?  Yeah, let's talk to Blue really fast.  Hey, Blue, you want to go on the air?  We haven't talked to Blue yet.  All right.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to blow it up.  Blow it up.  What?  What's up, Blue?  Hey, Blue.  Blow it up.  Blue.  Y'all never heard of that yet?  Hey, Blue.  Yo, Blue. 
[00:09:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Put it in a pool.  I don't know.  I know.  Hey, Blue.  Can you hear him?  Yo, Blue.  Hey, Blue, how are you doing?  Are the buttons pressed on me?  Yeah, yeah.  He should be on our phone.  Yeah, I'm Big Blue.  Hey, Blue, how are you doing, man?  All right.  Are you psyched to be going shopping today for the holidays?  I would like that.  And you can accommodate me with that. 
[00:09:30]  What do you think you're going to be buying today?  Huh?  What are you going to buy today, Blue?  All right.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  My friend.  He's like every Mr. Pryor of them.  My name is O'Dell.  My real name is O'Dell.  All right.  What's up with you, bro?  You hear me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you going to buy today?  Whatever I can for.  I mean, I mean, I mean, you know?  No, don't let him wait. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, I mean, you know?  Dude, this guy the whole way was just talking about how he wanted to be on the air.  Yeah.  Well, there you go.  He's on the air.  All right, Blue.  I really appreciate this.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas to you.  Merry Christmas.  And my man's back.  All right.  All right.  Oh, boy.  There you go.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wait until the small finds out that they are the ones we have picked.  They are the ones we have picked for this.  Rick, wait for the phone.  Hey, Rick. 
[00:10:30]  Rick.  All right.  We alcohol swabbed the phone down.  Oh, that's hilarious.  You know, we made a mistake.  We put the homeless on the bus about an hour ago, and Keith and everyone has been freaking  out trying to keep these guys preoccupied.  That's why we're running down with food and beer and sodas and porno and Rambo movies  and Godzilla movies.  Yeah, Keith is in the office looking through going, what movies do you think they like?  Oh, they like wrestling.  Like he's talking about retarded children.  They like wrestling.  Oh, Godzilla. 
[00:11:00]  We'll play Godzilla and wrestling.  All right.  Hey, do you guys use your phone?  Hey, oh.  Yeah, Rick.  You guys want to talk to Butt and Roll or Sperm next?  Uh, Butt and Roll.  Butt and Roll.  Butt and Roll.  We're on the air.  Hello?  Butt and Roll, what's up?  I'm chilling.  How you doing?  You're chilling, my brother.  I'm glad to be here.  I appreciate what you're doing for me.  Yeah, you're going to be going shopping today.  You got anything in mind, what you want to buy?  I'm going to buy me a coat.  That's all I want to leave.  You're going to get a coat.  You're going to get a nice coat.  Nice warm coat for the winter. 
[00:11:30]  I didn't say coat.  I said coat.  Right.  No, we heard coat.  I didn't say coat.  I said coat.  Coats, not coats.  All right.  All right.  Good luck with the next, Mr.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Listen, Rick, get Rick back on the phone.  Guys.  Yeah, Rick, we've got to let you go.  We've got to get these guys down there with you, all right?  All right.  Cool.  All right.  We'll check in with you in a little bit.  You got to, man.  Yeah, because these guys have got to get on the road.  Jim Norton in the studio.  Jim is going on another bus ride.  Oh, boy.  Jim, Rick, I think Steve C., right? 
[00:12:00]  Steve C.  These are all veterans of bus events that this station has put on, one of which ended tragically.  The only difference between this and the Voyeur bus is the jail cell actually smelled nicer than the buses going to.  Rich Voss is going on the bus.  And Voss, yes.  So, have fun, guys.  We've got to let these guys go.  There they go.  Well, I've been running.  Bye, Steve.  Guys, best of luck. 
[00:12:30]  I must really like you to do this.  I know.  I know.  I think this is legal, isn't it?  You're going to have fun, man.  Yeah.  Give us a call when you get down there, all right?  All right, cool.  Well, there you have it, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Homeless shopping spree, too.  When a lot of people, a lot of people, very curious where we're going.  When are we going to announce the mall that these homeless are going to so the people can join them?  We will announce the mall 15 minutes before we get there.  15 minutes before we get there. 
[00:13:00]  That's the best we can do.  Are there going to be any hints?  Like, hey, we're on such and such a road.  Yeah, we'll drop a few hints.  All right.  We'll drop a few hints.  That way people might be able to get a little closer to the area.  Yeah, we're looking forward to our listeners, you know, joining the homeless people for the shopping spree today, Anthony.  It's a lot of fun.  We do this together.  Now, why is it that we can't just announce the location?  Well, we don't want barricades up, Anthony.  Exactly.  I don't know, though.  Any mall that would turn these gentlemen away just based on their appearance and odor, that's not what this Christmas spirit is all about. 
[00:13:30]  I've got to tell the malls.  Not this time of year.  All the malls are listening to us now.  We're getting e-mails from our listeners that work for all the malls in the area.  And they're like, dude, you know, there's warnings out that you guys are maybe coming to our mall.  I'm just giving you a heads up.  What I wanted to tell the malls, this is a good business day for you. 
[00:14:00]  Trust me.  Oh, yeah.  Because you're going to have a couple thousand of our listeners joining the homeless people, and they're all spending money today.  Right.  They will be shopping in your mall.  And you don't know who you are yet, but this is a good thing for you.  And you know what would be really bad?  I think it would be a PR catastrophe for any shopping establishment to turn away these people based on what?  Their appearance?  Look how excited Butter Roll was.  Oh, my God.  He's going to get a jacket.  He's going to get a new coat.  Our homeless people will be well-behaved today. 
[00:14:30]  And did you hear what Blue was saying?  Oh.  I'm asking you.  Did you hear?  I can understand a goddamn word he was saying, Opie.  I know this.  We have two and a half people per homeless guy today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll watch them.  I know.  It's better than the prison ratio.  Yeah.  To tell you the truth.  Well, I think we're going to take our first break because we're going to spend a lot of time talking to the bus and stuff.  But the bus is outside the Brooklyn Diner on 57th Street between 7th and Broadway, and it is taking off in minutes.  Yeah, well, those guys will take off. 
[00:15:00]  We'll take a break, and when we come back, I guess we'll check back in with them, see how everyone's going to get psyched up for this shopping.  By the way, if you see the bus on the highways and the byways, give us a call.  Yeah.  It's very obvious.  There's N.E.W. and Opie and Anthony all over the time.  Oh, wow stickers.  Okay?  We're helping.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Homeless Shopping Spree is supported by Coral Limousine, 866-91-Coral, and the Hard Rock Cafe, 221 West 57th Street in Manhattan.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:15:30]  1027.  W.N.E.W.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Homeless Shopping Spree 2 on the Opie and Anthony program.  We've got to go right to the bus, Anthony, and talk to Rick.  Rick, what's going on?  Hey, guys, we are making our way through the city, and we've already had our first altercation, so to speak, or uprising.  Blue seems to be having a problem.  Blue is having a problem with what?  Blue is having a problem with the fact that he heard on the radio Norton mention about jail. 
[00:16:00]  So he thinks he's going to jail.  Oh, smack him in the head and tell him no one's going to jail.  Oh, here.  I got my old back.  Here.  What is he saying?  He's going to be wigging out.  What is he saying?  He's talking about this about Homeless.  He goes, he's got me from the stand, and I think he's going to jail.  Put him on the phone.  You want to talk to him?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hey, you guys want to talk to Blue? 
[00:16:30]  Want to talk to the radio again?  Want to talk to the radio?  By the way, Anthony, we're on the way to the mall, obviously, for the Homeless Shopping Spree.  Hey, Blue.  Hello?  Blue.  Blue, what's up?  Hello?  Hey, Blue.  Blue.  Hey, Blue.  Yeah, Blue, are you listening?  Yeah, what?  Look, everything's cool, bro.  We're just hanging.  You're going to go shopping.  You hear it?  Hello?  Oh, no.  Hey, Blue.  Blue, Blue, you hear us? 
[00:17:00]  Hey.  Turn that fader down.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Get Psycho Mark on.  Hold on.  I had to put him on hold.  He's cursing like crazy.  Let's go to Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Mark A.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  What's going on?  We can't talk to Blue.  He can never seem to hear us.  Turned out of his mind.  He got in a big fight with Youngblood.  Youngblood, why did you even start with him?  Tell me.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  They love that S-word.  He started a fight with his nose trying a lot of S. 
[00:17:30]  I was able to dump out his ass.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Mark.  Mark.  Yeah, look at this.  Mark, they can't curse.  They're homeless.  It's impossible.  All right.  Please.  So Youngblood started a confrontation with Blue because Blue is talking a lot of S.  Right.  And Youngblood's on with him because he wants to rag him on.  But I told him, I said, wait until 14th Street.  You guys can rip each other's hot dog. 
[00:18:00]  When you get back there, you can put other spaces, but have a nice time.  It's a good Christmas.  Go shopping.  All right.  I'm really calm.  Totally calm right now.  Hopefully, uh, it will stay calm.  Tommy and Tommy are absolutely silent, which is amazing.  Yeah, well, they're hungover.  I'm completely passed out.  All right.  Hold on a second.  I've got to go back to Rick, all right?  Stay there, Mark.  Let's go to Rick.  He's, this bus is really huge.  So Rick's in another section of the bus. 
[00:18:30]  Rick.  All right.  Well, it looks like, uh, looks like Big Ed is comforting Big Blue now.  Okay.  How is he comforting him?  Well, he's got his hand on his shoulder and just keeps grabbing his hand and, like,  pushing his cheek up again on how to get rowdy again.  He gets rowdy.  You hear that?  He's talking about how he used to work on Fifth Avenue.  We are mere minutes into this ride and already there's been two fights.  You know, the staff is drinking more than the homeless.  I think so.  To deal with this, Anthony. 
[00:19:00]  Unbelievable.  All right, Rick.  Hold on a line.  I've got to check in with Norton.  Norton's in another part of the bus.  Uh, Norton.  I hate you both.  We have gone two blocks.  The other side of the bus smells like a diaper.  The driver looks like Apollo Creed's trainer.  Yeah.  Let it go.  Oh, I hate this already.  We're in traffic.  It smells.  There's AIDS all over the place. 
[00:19:30]  And they're fighting.  Yeah, I hear now that there's little confrontations going on, but no one can really figure out why.  English from Escape from Alcatraz wants to get off the bus.  He's screaming.  It's an absolute nightmare.  Let me all, let me all.  You think he's going to jail?  This stinks.  You've got to inform the guy that he's getting money and he's going to be shopping and no jail is in his future.  All right, that's a good idea.  It's easy to talk sense to a man in a blackout who hasn't slept indoors in four years. 
[00:20:00]  Maybe I should talk about the market and the Dow Jones and how things are going to get better, too.  I'm not listening.  He's a blackout.  Hold on.  We've got to go back to Rick.  Blue is crying.  Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  All right.  He stopped crying.  He's laughing again.  All right.  Why was he crying?  Hey, Big Blue, why were you crying, man?  You want to talk to him?  Why were you crying?  Don't give him the phone, though, Rick.  No, I'm not going to. 
[00:20:30]  Because he came here.  Yeah.  Because he loves my eyes.  I wear glasses.  Because you wear glasses?  Oh, my God.  Oh, there you go.  There you go.  All right.  You heard it.  He's crying because he wears glasses.  Remember that for what do we learn?  Blue is crying because he wears glasses.  Rick.  Yeah.  How is our favorite from last year, Ziggy, doing?  Ziggy.  Ziggy took a leak on the seat.  Ziggy took a goddamn leak on the seat. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, my God.  What's the matter?  Ziggy Tom looks like he's foaming at the mouth.  He's got drool all over.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Sorry.  Oh.  What happened, Rick?  Dude.  He went number one on himself.  Ziggy Tom passed out.  He went number one on himself.  And Ziggy was trying to wake him up. 
[00:21:30]  They're wetting themselves, crying and fighting.  They're like, it's like a rolling daycare center.  All right.  All right.  I have to.  Hold on a second.  I got to break in here, Anthony.  And I want to tell every listener of the Opie and Anthony show to call every single person you know  and tell them to listen to this show today, because this is one of the classics, man.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Now, Snoop is smacking Ziggy Tom, and he won't wake up.  We'll make sure he's all right.  He'll still wake up, man. 
[00:22:00]  You want to go to the radio?  Yo.  Don't die on himself.  I'm going to shout.  Give me time.  I'm going to shout, man.  Give me time.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Yo.  Now they think there's a riot going on.  Rick, I'm going to go back to Norton.  All right.  Go back to Norton.  All right.  Let me go back to Jimmy.  Norton.  Norton, you there?  You might have hung up.  Yeah.  Let me see if Psycho Mark's still there. 
[00:22:30]  Psycho Mark?  What's going on?  Hey, man.  I'm sitting in the back of the box.  I got to see this remind me so confident of his lines.  The boys don't want another drink.  What's that?  Take it in.  Tippi Thompson depends.  Tippi Thompson depends.  Oh, you got to get Tippi Thompson depends?  Tippi Thompson adult says.  Got to get some adult diapers for Tippi Thompson.  Oh, my God.  All right, Mark.  Mark, we'll check in with you in a little bit, right?  All right.  Someone is on the line.  Oh, they just hung up.  They said we should allow the homeless people to curse today because this is more like a 
[00:23:00]  documentary.  Well, that's true.  Like, scared straight, the prisoners were able to curse and whatnot.  Anthony from Weston is saying he's wetting his pants just listening to this.  And Sheep Lover is saying, I have to say, even before they get to the mall, homeless shopping  spree to better than the original.  Well, yeah.  Because no one was in our way this time around, Anthony.  They wanted us to go to the shelters last time.  And Anthony from West Orange, again, saying that perhaps Ziggy marked his territory for  the ride back. 
[00:23:30]  Okay.  That's what he was saying.  A couple.  I got a couple.  Junk mail, Jerry, from the city.  These malls have to feel like the different countries of Europe, wondering which one of  them were going to be next on the German invasion list.  And then somebody else wondering if there's a 15-year-old boy rider for the Rolling Stone  magazine going along on the bus, almost homeless.  That's what they would call that.  We will announce the mall we're going to about 15 minutes before we get there. 
[00:24:00]  Okay.  Dave from Jersey.  Voss is going.  Jesus.  Bad smell, bad language, and now bad joke.  Hey, Voss.  Hey.  What's up, Voss?  How you doing, man?  My eyes are teary.  Yeah, that's it.  We hear the smells really bad.  I think what we should do is just take them up to the woods and hunt them.  Okay?  And the winner keeps all the money.  The homeless hunt.  The homeless hunt.  The homeless hunt.  I'm telling you.  That sounds like maybe next year.  This is unbelievable.  I don't know if this stink is worse than Norris' act, but this is bad stink in here. 
[00:24:30]  And listen to me.  I'm scared to go back there.  Yeah.  Are all of you guys hanging out at the front of the bus?  Yeah, we're hanging out at the front.  I'm going to go back there and see if any of them can write me some new material.  All right, Voss.  All right.  I'm going to go back there for a second.  They're all going.  I know the struggle.  All right, Voss.  Thank you.  All right, cool.  Hey, from Boston.  Is Blue too stupid to realize that jail would be an upgrade in his lifestyle?  Yeah.  Why are they so bummed about that? 
[00:25:00]  Rick.  Yo.  How's it going?  It's going okay.  Blue wants to wish everybody now a Merry Christmas.  Oh, is he okay now?  He's not crying anymore?  He seems to be okay.  Yeah.  High fives.  He's showing the love.  Are we going to be doing some kind of Christmas carols later on?  Oh, yeah.  Those are coming up as soon as we get onto our highway.  Great.  And Ben is on the phone.  He says he's in the back of the bus with Rock and Roll Tommy.  Well, let's go to Ben.  Talk to Ben.  First time Ben's checking in from the bus. 
[00:25:30]  Ben?  Guys, Rock and Roll Tommy is in the back of the bus spraying lights all over the place.  He's disgusted with the smell himself.  Rock and Roll Tommy is disgusted with the smell.  What's with the smell, Rock and Roll Tommy?  What do you think of the smell back here?  It smells fine with air pressure.  There's spraying air pressure all over the place.  Ben, I know you get really easily grossed out by this stuff.  How are you dealing with the smell?  Lots of Lysol.  Yeah.  Lots of Lysol.  And this is my first trip to the back of the bus. 
[00:26:00]  All the guys are in the back and Norton and Voss are hidden in the front and Mark and  Mick are in the front.  This is a day that will make Ben very happy.  And are the homeless guys, have they started drinking alcohol yet?  No.  We're trying to control that.  They've been asking for it.  But with the condition of some of them, we thought we'd hold off for a little while.  Yeah.  I think maybe a couple of beers before they get to the mall, but not too many.  Yeah.  I could agree with that.  All right. 
[00:26:30]  Okay.  Thank you, Ben.  All right.  Hey, is traffic moving?  What's that?  Is the traffic moving along?  Yeah, we're still, we're on 57th and First Avenue right now.  Oh.  Oh.  We're moving along.  Oh, is that our first hint?  Oh, that's the first hint.  Is that our first hint?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Hey, Ben.  Yeah.  Is anyone following you guys?  Yeah, we got a good little cow man going here.  Really?  Cool.  A few cars behind us, yeah, and a lot of people cheering along the way. 
[00:27:00]  All right.  It's nice to go by K-Rock and beat the horns.  Great.  Ben, thank you.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Don't have time for that today, trust me.  No.  We'll talk about it, though.  Hey, Gary, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  11-year-old Gary.  Gary.  I got to admit, I started listening to you in 99.  Right.  This is the funniest S I've ever heard.  You like the homeless shopping spree, too.  I think I'm a crap man.  It's so funny.  No, don't crap yourself, young Gary. 
[00:27:30]  No, I'm not going to.  They're doing enough crapping on the bus.  We've just begun, young Gary.  And I just want to tell you, I think they gave out where you're going.  No, no, no.  Not necessarily.  They did.  Keep it to yourself, Gary, if you're that smart, all right?  All right.  All right.  We'll talk to you a little later.  All right.  Bye.  It's your little pal, Opie.  You going to take him to that hockey game?  I will be taking him to a hockey game.  How come you haven't taken him yet?  I got a little e-mail from...  I can still hear them.  Uh, Gary's nephew.  Uh, Tricia, what's up? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  Gary's uncle.  Um, I just think it's...  Gary's nephew would be...  You know, I mentioned whether it's legal, but I don't think it's ethical.  Uh, what, Tricia?  I don't think it's very ethical.  Where are you from?  Salamanca.  Yeah.  Then don't listen, you twat.  No.  What...  What seems to be your problem, uh, Tricia?  Well, I just think that having these people on display to be ridiculous...  Bye-bye.  That's how much we care about you and your stupid phone call.  You know something?  Don't wreck our buzz today.  They're gonna have, uh, money and go to the malls and get some, uh, clothing.  There you go. 
[00:28:30]  Have some fun.  And these guys are, uh, completely, uh, into it, man.  They're thrilled.  Yeah.  To have the opportunity to be part of this today.  Ray, what's up?  Well, I'm gonna tell...  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Tell me that guy, Blue, doesn't sound like Damon Wayans from The Living Caller.  Oh, when he would do the, uh, homeless guy?  There's, uh, crapping in the jar and stuff?  Yeah.  Ha-ha-ha.  He does.  Remember that bit Damon Wayans used to do?  Blue does sound just like him.  Just like him.  I can't wait to get a little more of Blue, uh, on the phone. 
[00:29:00]  And then once they get to the mall.  Oh, my God.  Trying to keep them together.  You know what it is?  They're on a bus.  They can't move around right now.  How the hell are they gonna keep those guys together?  We were just trying to keep them on the bus for an hour and it was a nightmare.  Yeah, they wanted to get off the bus and start walking around like they're homeless.  They're used to just walking around.  We probably have about 40 people from, uh, from the station going as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of people.  There's like a caravan of just, uh, you know, uh, radio personnel following the bus.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  And, um, I hear, uh, we might have some pictures and whatnot.  Uh, yeah.  Oh, well, Steve is, uh, taking video and we'll probably have three to four hundred pictures  of this.  Great.  When we're all, uh, done.  All you can do is go to opieandanthony.com and you can see the, the people that are joining  us.  You can see the participants.  It's the headshots.  So when, when, when Blue goes back on the air and cries, you'll go, oh, there's Blue.  That's what he looks like.  Let me pop him up so you can get a little, uh, a little visual going.  Right.  There's Blue right there.  Let's go back to the phone here. 
[00:30:00]  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I used to work in, uh, Manhattan with the same person as Keith.  I know this guy, Blue.  He used to be on my, he's out of his mind.  You guys can't talk to this guy on the radio.  What do you mean he's out of his mind?  Every other word out of his mouth is FRS.  Yeah, we noticed that.  You guys are the best.  Homeless shopping rules.  Alright, cool.  Thanks, bro.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Let's go to John.  John, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hello.  What's up, John?  What's up, fellas?  How you doing? 
[00:30:30]  Good.  Oh, this is the funniest S I've heard in a long time.  Hey, is, uh, Norton gonna bring any lad bags some more with him today?  The lad bag.  You know what?  He's spending half the time in the bathroom while he's over there.  Crinkle, crinkle.  When Norton says he's miserable and he hates us, that is the truth.  Yeah, he is not a happy guy being on that bus right now.  He will be smoking by the end of this, uh, day.  Oh, that's right.  He's trying to quit.  Alright.  Thank you, John.  Alright, boys.  Thank you.  Alright.  Uh, Paul, what's going on?  What's going on over here?  Hey, what up?  Yo, I'm a loyal listener from Boston.  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  But I find this to be the stupidest thing.  Why is...  And don't listen.  Go listen to some Rock and Roll.  See, it's not that I don't like you all.  You all are the greatest.  But this is making no sense.  Do you have nothing to talk about today?  Hey, Paul, thank you.  Yeah, that's great.  If you don't get this, then you...  That's great.  Don't bother listening to our show, alright?  Well, I love your show, but you're also stupid.  Good, you do.  Alright.  Sure you do.  Okay.  Let's go to Jim.  Jim, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Come on, guys.  Dude, this tower is the first shopping spree.  This is hysterical on this end.  Paul.  Paul's a tool.  Actually, the only thing for Vasto, this is the first time that dryer door joke would 
[00:31:30]  work.  With a bunch of bumps.  Have a good time, guys.  Take it easy.  Alright, let's go back to Rick.  He's on the bus.  We've been waiting for these guys to call back.  Hey, Rick, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Alright.  We're in the back of the middle of the bus, and Blue is just...  Uh-oh.  Blue is what?  Hello?  Blue is fake.  You like to marry?  Rick.  You like to marry?  Rick, you broke up.  Can you hear what you said?  Blue is doing what? 
[00:32:00]  Rick.  Hello, Miss Mary?  Yes.  Tell Mary.  I guess Blue likes Mary.  I forgot Mary's on the bus.  Thank you.  Blue is hitting on intern Mary.  What is she doing on that bus?  Hypoid Mary.  Hypoid Mary.  Hypoid Mary, yeah.  That's so funny!  Hey, Rick.  Rick, you were breaking up a little bit.  So what?  Blue is making the moves on Mary?  Blue is doing his best romance and spiel to Mary, and it seemed to be working. 
[00:32:30]  She was talking like crazy.  Oh, I'm sure.  Uh-oh.  There he goes.  He's going to the bathroom.  What?  Blue is going to the bathroom.  Where?  Where's he going?  He's headed to the bathroom.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, there you go.  The first homeless guy that is going to use the bathroom on the music.  Actually, it's a little video.  What are you doing?  All right.  Immediately, rock and roll Tommy's running around with a lights all can't spray in.  Oh, my fingers are out.  You know what it's going to smell like when he opens that door back up? 
[00:33:00]  Homeless dumpster.  Dumpster food dump is pretty much where the fumes that are going to come out of that bathroom.  Rick, what else is going on on the bus?  They're just kind of hanging out and waiting?  All right.  All right.  Rick's friend.  He's taking another nap.  He's napping.  They love napping, the homeless.  Napping.  Okay.  Yeah.  He's definitely out cold.  Looks like his farm is just chilling with Snoop.  All right.  And making friends.  That's nice.  So they're more relaxed than they're realizing they're not going to get arrested, right? 
[00:33:30]  All right.  Hey, Rick, your phone's crapping out.  Kind of crappy.  We'll try him in a minute or two.  We're going to have a lot of that today because we've got just cell phones everywhere.  Yeah.  Frank, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Funny, funny.  Cool.  I was just thinking when this bus pulls up to the mall with all these guys passed out  covered in excrement urine, it's going to be like a boxcar rolling up to Auschwitz.  I cannot believe that there is a bathroom just a few seats away from anyone on that bus. 
[00:34:00]  Yet two of them already have decided that they would rather sit in their own urine than get up and go to the bathroom.  Or maybe they didn't realize they were going, which is even more disturbing.  But two of the homeless have already wet themselves in the seats.  Well, when they pull up and the mall security is there, it's going to be like the Nazi thumb guy telling them to get the hell out of there.  Oh, well, we'll have to wait and see.  It's going to get interesting from here on out.  All right, guys. 
[00:34:30]  Great show.  Keep it up, man.  Thank you.  Neil's got an observation.  Let's go to Neil.  Neil, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  All right.  Great stuff.  Thanks.  I was thinking that based on the coordinates of the bus that were last given, I think I just heard a collective sigh of relief from the New Jersey side of Manhattan.  Well, you don't know for sure.  It might be a clever ruse.  Clever ruse.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Very nice.  That's a funny, funny observation.  There was a little clue that was given out as to where the bus, what direction it was heading in.  Still wide open. 
[00:35:00]  I think so.  As to where they can be going.  There's still a couple things you could do from that area, right?  Oh, hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  All right.  We've got to get to Psycho Mark.  Take left, go right.  Thank you, Neil.  Yeah, we might be doing the muddle-lock thing, Anthony.  Three rights make a left.  Three rights make a left.  Psycho Mark, what's up?  Cross and Nordner, as far in front of the bus as we can possibly be, so we can die first  if this thing comes.  I just went back there.  Yeah, those two are not going to go to the back of the bus.  I just went back there.  I know one of them. 
[00:35:30]  I know Butter Roll.  You know Butter Roll?  He's in front of the cellar every night.  He's like an angry man when you don't give him money.  And he's so mellow right now, right?  We're chatting and stuff.  I think we're going to hang after the whole thing's done.  Butter Roll's kind of like a cool guy.  He's like almost out of this.  Half of them are like sleeping in a drunken stupor.  Okay?  It's unbelievable.  I love that guy.  I gave him cigarettes and stuff.  Yeah.  And I'm talking recovery with them and they're just staring at me like I'm some alien. 
[00:36:00]  Talking recovery with them.  Because one guy is sober like three months, right?  Yeah.  And I think between all of them there's four teeth.  Right?  Yeah.  So we don't have to worry about any of them biting us.  It's really scary.  Yeah.  You know it's bad when Voss is talking recovery to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can go to an AA meeting and keep everybody busy for months.  I knew the struggle.  Hey, you guys, get Jim Norton to call us in. 
[00:36:30]  Call in.  Hold on.  No, no.  Have him use his phone.  Do you want to know what a disgrace this is?  What?  Are you there?  Yeah, go ahead, Jim.  The guy blew into the bathroom and everybody's home.  We'll go to the bathroom.  We'll go to the bathroom.  People on the bus are excited because a homeless man is dropping the Cosby kids off in the pool.  I am not happy to be on this bus.  Oh, my God.  Listen to Voss hacking and coughing.  If they don't have AIDS, he certainly does. 
[00:37:00]  I know you try.  He wants to give some of them a lump of their money.  I'm in the back and he's as drier drunk than anybody I've ever met.  So it's going really well.  Have a good time.  Have a good time.  Good bed.  Thank you.  They're now demanding to stop at a liquor store.  Uh-oh.  Now, I saw a case of beer, at least one case, under one of the front seats of the bus.  Yeah.  I'm just wondering if they've been allowed to take part in the beer yet. 
[00:37:30]  I know they want to go to a liquor store.  That may be...  Which one?  I don't know.  Because Tippi Tom yesterday, and I know why they call him Tippi Tom now,  he was on a 45-degree angle.  Backwards.  Backwards.  Where he could not walk.  He was standing at the ceiling.  He had to push his shoulder blades forward, or the guy would have fallen right back on the back of his head.  I can only imagine how many times he has done that on the streets.  We're trying not to give them too much beer before they get to the mall or anything.  Not until...  It's got to be timed out.  There's a formula here.  You don't give them enough, they're not going to be themselves, let's say, in the mall. 
[00:38:00]  You give them too much, and we're going to have a problem.  So, it's a fine line.  Some of them might be able to handle their booze.  Others, no.  Right.  Ziggy's going to need a couple of beers.  He hasn't said a word.  He's napping.  He's napping.  He's going to be the star by the end of this night.  Yes.  What's up?  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you?  Good.  Great, great stuff.  I mean, real funny.  I was thinking next year to outdo this, how about getting a bunch of progeria kids and  taking them to FAO Schwartz for the holidays.  Oh, that'd be great. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, very good.  Not bad, huh?  That's good.  I'm going to jump around on the keyboard on the floor like in the movie Big.  Yeah.  Me and Dan Hanks.  I'm going to play that little song.  I'm so light that I can't even trigger the little sensors.  So, my part never comes through.  Hey, Uncle John, what's up?  And then my parents went to carry me out of FAO Schwartz once, and the security came  running over because they thought they were carrying an ET doll out of the store, but  it was me. 
[00:39:00]  I'm a regular kid.  I look a little weird.  Regular kid.  You like to play baseball.  Yeah, I play baseball.  Give me a glove and a bat.  I'm happy.  Hey, Uncle John, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to give a heads up to these people that are calling in and saying this is  wrong and it's not right and all that stuff.  Yeah.  You know, these guys are going to make out like bandits.  I don't know, but two years ago, people were buying them coats and clothes.  Yeah.  That's another thing.  We give them money so they can go and buy stuff at the mall.  But the people, the listeners of this show that join them at the mall, they go all out. 
[00:39:30]  Remember, Ziggy was like a favorite.  They were buying him sneakers and a jacket, all of which he got pounded on, beat up on  the street so other homeless could steal it from him.  But we're helping the homeless economy that way.  He was able to keep some of the stuff.  It puts newer goods and services into the community.  That's what I want to say to the malls.  I'm telling you, a lot of our listeners are going to buy a lot of stuff today.  A lot of stuff.  Don't you worry about it.  I doubted.  And, you know, the guy Snoop wants to come on the show.  He's on the bus for the last homeless shopping spree.  There's only two that were on the first one. 
[00:40:00]  Ziggy and this guy Snoop.  Snoop is off the street now.  Oh, I know.  He dresses better than you and I.  You go to Snoop's picture on the website there.  Either one.  What is it?  OpieandAnthony.com.  OpieandAnthony.com will work today.  Yeah.  You go to that and plunk down Snoop.  That guy was almost two years ago.  This guy was almost, look at his watch, his sweater, his jeans, his jacket.  Clean as a whistle, this guy.  He took off his fancy shades that he was wearing.  He's got a job.  And last year he was homeless and he was on this homeless shopping spree. 
[00:40:30]  Two years ago.  Yeah.  And we met him on the sidewalk.  He goes, guys, I know this is all about fun and doing some cool radio, but I just want  to tell you guys that because of the last time you did this, it set me straight, man.  So something went wrong with what we did?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I hate touching moments.  All right, Uncle John.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Later.  You know what this is like, what I realized from two years ago with Ziggy getting beaten  up and his clothing stolen that he bought at the mall? 
[00:41:00]  This is like our homeless economic stimulus package.  You know?  It's like we're giving the community some stuff that they can then beat up other people for  and take.  And it works its way down the line.  It's the trickle down theory that Reagan talked about so many years ago.  We're helping.  All right.  We'll take it with Rick real fast and we have to take a break.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, no, it's Keith.  Hold on.  Snoop wants to talk to you guys real quick.  Snoop. 
[00:41:30]  Here's Snoop.  Come on in here.  Yeah, you're on here.  Hey, how's this going, gentlemen?  What's up, Snoop?  I just got a comment to some of the negative callers that's been calling in.  You know, people fail to realize that anybody needs help, even the president.  You know what I'm saying?  And before I came to the show, I was doing bad just like Ziggy and some of the other people  peeing on themselves in the streets.  Yeah.  You know, it's a shame that people don't care.  They forget where they come from and that everybody needs help. 
[00:42:00]  It wasn't for 102.7.  I'll still be in the streets today.  All right.  Look at that.  All these negative people calling me about these negative things.  All right.  He's breaking up.  Right in the middle of his compassionate speech here, Anthony.  But basically he's saying, because of this station and us, he would, you know,  if it wasn't for us, he'd still be on the street.  Even though I'm still homeless.  I don't have a job.  I'm in a job training program.  You know, I still need help.  Right.  Yeah.  You know, everybody does.  You know, and that's the main focus in this man-made society. 
[00:42:30]  People forget everybody needs help.  All right.  And, you know, it's a shame.  It really is a shame.  Cool, Snoop.  Well, have fun today, all right?  I will, sir.  Thank you.  All right.  And thank you to all the caring people out there because, you know,  everybody needs help once again.  There you go.  There it is.  Thank you.  That will be the only serious moment of the show today, Anthony.  Enough of those speeches.  Get back to the people that are crapping themselves, please.  All right.  I'm assuming they're out of Manhattan at this point.  Oh, you would think?  I'm thinking. 
[00:43:00]  Manhattan's safe.  I think Manhattan is safe.  I would think so, too.  You could rule out Manhattan.  Yeah, well, I think that was obvious.  At this point, we could tell people we did want to go down, like, Fifth Avenue in Madison.  Yeah, but...  Why don't we take a bus down there?  There's trouble.  Well, I think the cops have had enough problems to deal with, so we want to just leave them alone.  Ah.  This time around.  That could be a hint right there, too, my friend.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Want to leave the cops alone.  What?  NYPD? 
[00:43:30]  Well, it's not Manhattan.  NYPD's in five boroughs, my friend.  I'm just saying it's not Manhattan.  Okay.  All right.  Do you know where we're going?  I know where we're going.  Oh.  I'm just saying, you know, NYPD is Manhattan, but it's also Queens.  True.  It's Brooklyn.  True.  You're right.  You're right.  Well, let's take a break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the Homeless Shopping Show.  Yes.  True.  Opie and Anthony.  1027. 
[00:44:00]  WNEW.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Homeless Shopping's free, too, Ant.  Yes.  The bus is loaded with 10 very smelly homeless people.  Yep.  And they're on their way to the mall, Anthony.  What mall?  Hmm.  We'll let you know 15 minutes before we get there.  Rich Voss on the bus.  What's up?  Where is Voss? 
[00:44:30]  There he is.  Hey, Voss.  I think your caller should take stock out in FUBU and Timberland for when we get to the  mall.  I think there's going to be a lot of purchasing.  You know what I'm saying?  I think a lot of FUBU.  And Timberland.  I think the stock's going to go up once we get to the mall.  If we get there without puking.  What else is going on?  Are you guys stuck in traffic or anything?  Yeah, we're stuck in traffic.  People are driving by holding their nose.  Oh, really?  We're stuck in traffic.  But they're pretty mellow.  All the guys are pretty mellow. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, this is the calm before the storm.  Yeah, they have settled down finally, Anthony.  I'm giving them cigarettes and stuff.  You know, it's kind of like prison.  I'm buying them.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  I give them cigarettes and then they owe me.  So.  It's going good right now.  It's pretty mellow.  Yeah.  No one's peeing themselves or screaming or yelling or anything.  No fighting.  No, I noticed, Rich, that there's a lot of seats on that bus.  More seats.  A hell of a lot more seats than there are people.  Are some of the homeless is buddying up and sitting next to each other even though there's 
[00:45:30]  plenty of seats for everyone?  No, no.  I think, no, they're all kind of alone.  I think they compete because, you know, it's like when they're bumming money, they want  to be next to each other.  Right.  It kind of ruins it.  Yeah.  So I think they're kind of like competing on the bus.  They all want their own space and stuff.  They're doing it.  See, because I think Tippy Tom and Rock and Roll Tommy, I kind of think of them as a team  now.  You know?  They hate each other.  But they hate each other.  Well, they're sitting close.  See, the funny thing is they're all taking their own seats, but everybody else, we're all 
[00:46:00]  in one seat so we can keep away from them.  I think.  You know, we're all squeezed up front right now.  I see them like a comedy team.  Kevin's falling asleep right here.  Look at this.  He's dreaming.  You can see like a big burger over his head.  Anyway, here's Norton.  All right.  Here's Jim Norton.  Hello, fellas.  Hey, Norton.  What's up?  How you doing?  Defeated.  Why?  Just because we're in bumper to bumper traffic.  We're not moving.  I have to take a dump. 
[00:46:30]  I can't do it here.  Why can't you just go into that bathroom and crunch?  I certainly will not do that.  I'd rather do it in my pants like the one dude does when he gets arrested.  I'm not going in that bathroom.  I have to see.  I can't do it here.  I'm just waiting until we get to the mall.  I can't tell you how many people are writing in Don Norton saying you're going to start  smoking any moment now.  I will not.  Mary's in the back drinking out of their mules to keep them quiet.  It's horrific.  Oh, that's awful.  Type for Mary, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  We're giving her like alcohol wugs and she's putting them on her tongue and gum.  Oh, God.  Oh, you're so smart.  Just roll it back and watch pieces of beef jerky fall off.  That's just awful.  I'm just really hoping, look, whenever you guys announce them all, I'm just hoping some  17-year-old will give me treats for tolerating this odor.  Well, you never know.  Yeah, you do know.  And it won't happen.  All right.  Here's Ben.  All right. 
[00:47:30]  Ben.  No.  No.  I guess there is no Ben.  Let's go to Rick.  Hey, Rick.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  We're just about ready to sing a little Christmas cow.  Oh, good.  I love this part.  But I noticed that rock and roll Tommy in the back.  He looks like he's about to light himself on fire.  He's got a lip cigarette and an aerosol can and he keeps turning it on right in front  of his face.  Well, why don't we...  Here he goes again.  Here he goes again.  No, no.  Don't burn up anybody.  Tommy, don't do that, dude.  Why don't we take the aerosol can away from Ronnie?  Yeah, how about that? 
[00:48:00]  Can we get the aerosol can away from him before he explodes?  It doesn't seem like that would be a good idea.  No.  No.  Stop it.  Hey, Rick.  How's the traffic?  How's the traffic?  The traffic is slow.  Slow?  Slow, but we're moving in the right direction.  Have you guys announced where we're going yet?  Hell no.  You've got to tell us when you're about 15 minutes away.  All right.  No problem.  We should be there in about five, maybe seven minutes.  As we get through this little traffic jam, we'll be fine.  Although this is for Rusty, who checked in on instant feedback.  Ouch.  Oh!  Are you answering in instant feedback? 
[00:48:30]  Well, he asked me a question and the answer is?  Ouch.  Okay.  All right.  All right, guys.  I think we're ready to sing.  All right.  Let's hear it.  Oh, great.  All right.  Everybody, we're doing Deck the Hall.  Page four.  You ready?  Page four.  And a one.  And a two.  And a...  Deck the Hall is a la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  Good job.  Good job.  Good job, fellas. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, my God.  The only thing I can make that better is screeching tires and some explosion.  I'll be homeless for Christmas.  All right.  Rick, hold on a second.  I've got to go to Ben real fast.  Yeah, no problem.  He's with Blue.  Ben.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  I'm there with Blue and you know we needed extra people to come on board today, so we brought  up Matty, who works at the Center for the Hall.  And the only thing I can make that better is screeching tires and some explosion.  I'll be homeless for Christmas.  All right.  Rick, hold on a second.  I've got to go to Ben real fast.

[00:54:30]  The power.  Oh, he's ripping off you off.  He's ripping off you.  Hallelujah.  No.  No.  Rick, what's going on?  Blue is standing up making a statement.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know if he can power.  Yeah, he said, don't underestimate the power of the big, big blue.  There you go.  The power of the big, big blue.  I think he's taking your line.  Don't underestimate the cycle factor in my head.  Well, that's Jay Moore's line. 
[00:55:00]  All right, Rick.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  All right.  How funny is it that Rick does what I said, knocks him on the head, and the guy just loses  his mind.  Don't effing wake me up.  I don't know you.  I don't know you.  Andy, what's up?  Andy.  Hey, man.  All right, you only get one shot.  We've got to move around here.  Ben, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Well, last Friday's show did nothing to stop our crew from smoking cigarettes.  The bus is filled with cigarette smoke at this point. 
[00:55:30]  And whatever happened, I was in the front of the bus, so I missed what happened with  Tiffy Tom, but he just threatened to kill me.  And I was in the front of him.  I'm going to kill all of you.  I'm going to kill him.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Tiffy Tom's yelling, you rock up the wrong mother ever.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  We had to dump out again.  Holy Jesus, he's lost his mind.  Losing his S on the bus.  Remind him we're giving him money, and he'll be shopping. 
[00:56:00]  And it'll be great.  Ben.  Tom, we're going to give you money, you're going to go shopping, we're going to have a good  time.  What time is it?  What time is it?  What time is it?  Like he's got an appointment.  He's wondering what time it is.  Oh, no.  Hey, wait a second.  I was supposed to get 20 bucks yesterday.  You got $100 when you're worried about 20 bucks.  You got the 20 bucks.  No, I got a bottle of liquor and that gold. 
[00:56:30]  Now he's arguing over money yesterday.  It's very funny because he's sitting right in front of Ziggy.  And Ziggy, you know, is very well behaved here, right behind him.  And Tom is just going nuts, screaming, yelling at anyone that walks by.  Now he's yelling at Steve and Keith.  Ben, who is the most freaked out on the bus?  Most freaked out?  Well, Blue is really freaked out.  As far as our staff goes.  Jim Norton is definitely freaked out.  Probably Jim Norton, I would say. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  Yeah.  And Mary, because Mary keeps getting hit on like crazy by Blue.  They were sharing cigarettes.  They were having cigarettes together.  Well, not sharing them.  They open up a pack and they're talking.  And Blue just keeps looking at her with a big smile.  He's sitting.  Mary's sitting on one side, but Blue's sitting, you know, in the next chair over.  He has not moved since his whole episode earlier.  So he likes Mary.  You know how many batches he's going to slam out with her in his head? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, God.  Bunch of homeless batter.  I bet.  Now rock and roll Tommy's screaming back here.  What's up, Tommy?  We're going to be an alcoholic t-shirt.  Yeah, Tommy's complaining about he wants booze, but he's rocking out.  He was showing me earlier his cheap trick CD and how he looks like Robin Xander.  He looks like Robin Xander if they were in a plane crash.  What is he talking about?  An alcoholic seizure.  He's going into an alcoholic seizure.  What's the alcoholic seizure about, Tommy? 
[00:58:00]  I'm going below .8.  He needs some booze.  I'm going below .8.  You know what?  He's not bad.  You could probably give him a beer.  God, do we have the breathalyzer on the bus?  That would have been a good thing.  Give just one guy the beer.  Just give rock and roll Tommy the beer and don't give the other one the beer.  Yeah, just give one to Tommy.  I want to see how this goes.  It's like throwing a steak to one tiger.  Right.  Ben.  Yeah.  Give him a beer.  Just him, though.  Just give him a beer.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  Hang on.  I don't...  This is great.  It's like we're able to play with human beings.  I like seeing what happens.  It's like a test subject.  All right.  I'm waiting.  I know.  He's getting the beer.  Yeah.  I know where the beer is.  Yeah.  Again, it's about...  See, I'm the way in the back.  Yeah, no, yeah.  That's the way in the front.  I'm still back here with Rock.  I'm going to the head of the class.  What did he say?  He's in the head of the class.  He just told me. 
[00:59:00]  I'm going to the head of the class.  He's going to the head of the class, Anthony.  Okay.  Mark is here.  Hang on.  Let me turn it over to Mark.  All right.  I have a beer.  All right.  What do you want me to do?  You want me to tantalize him?  Oh!  Keep going.  Oh, God.  What happened?  Hey.  Wait, hold on a second.  Keith's telling me really not to do this.  It's a bad idea.  If we start giving him booze, the rest of my mind will go bananas.  That's what I want.  That's what we want.  I want...  No, I want just him to get a beer and none of the other guys. 
[00:59:30]  We're just going to say...  You are going to...  But Keith is looking at me right now saying, absolutely not.  Well, get Keith on the phone.  Get Keith on the phone.  Oh, Keith, Keith, Keith.  Dude, this is like The Sims.  There has to be a certain sense of control.  Keith, we just want to give one beer to the Rock and Roll Tops.  Keith, just give him one beer.  Let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  Don't you think that the theory applies that if one gets, everybody's going to want...  That's what we want to hear.  Were we not all in the studio together yesterday? 
[01:00:00]  But just give him one beer.  Yeah, I know how it is.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  You guys are like the dealers that I like.  Just one, man.  It's all right.  Just have one.  The next thing you know, we're going to hold off for a little while longer.  I guess they didn't like our idea.  Oh, damn, it's okay.  Let's just put it this way, Keith.  When you finally start handing out the beer, right?  Right.  You've got to give one beer to Rock and Roll Tommy first so we can get the reaction and  then you can hand it out.  Oh, great.  Inciting a riot. 
[01:00:30]  I want to hear all of them freak out.  Oh, sure.  Because you're there.  Right.  And I'm here keeping control.  Exactly.  Won't that be great?  Hold on a second, man.  I've got to go to a couple of people.  Gerard, real quick, from Boston, says,  Ziggy thinking he's flying is one of the funniest things I've ever heard.  Ziggy and the bus going over the bridge.  He looked down, saw it like the water, and just thought he was on the plane.  Like, we're on top of the world.  We're landing now.  Adam, what's up?  Andy.  Hey, I'm going.  Hey, man. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Hey, when Ziggy was complaining and thinking that he was on the plane,  the latest thing, I'm telling you, if you play it back, he sounds just like Ozzy.  And if Norton gets a little bit too distraught, just have Ziggy talk to him,  and he can close his eyes and pretend he's Ozzy.  Crinkle, crinkle.  Crinkle, crinkle.  All right, Adam.  Thank you.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, poor Mary.  Mary's like the only girl on this bus, and they're hitting on her.  She got spit on yesterday.  As Tippy Tom was yapping about something, a big piece of spit flew out of his mouth 
[01:01:30]  and hit Mary on the arm.  I think she'd have rather been struck by hot lead than that guy's spit,  because she freaked out.  I think you could see scratches where she scrubbed herself with a brillo.  Lena from Boston.  Holy S, guys.  I want you to have these guys take pictures on Santa's lap.  Oh, we'll definitely do that.  We did that last time.  It's a wonderful photo op for the guys.  And you can imagine these guys trying stuff on and then putting it back on the rack. 
[01:02:00]  I know.  Who is going to end up wearing things they have tried on?  Ernie from Jersey said,  This is great.  We get to play with human beings.  I think Dr. Mengele said that, too.  No, it's like a little test subject, a little test environment that goes along  with basic primal human nature.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you know what you guys should do?  You know what I'm saying?  You go and get close to these guys?  Yeah.  You guys should take them to the bed and bath store and have them get all cleaned up  and give them smelly soaps and stuff like that.  Well, they're going to go wherever they want. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  Maybe they'll head over there.  You guys should make it over there because, I mean,  it sounds like your little friends over there saying that that place smells like a dumpster  or something like that.  You should squirt for a few times and see what to do.  Well, there'll be plenty of people probably going to the cologne counters and whatnot.  There you have it.  Sure.  All right, why don't we take a break because I have a feeling when we come back from break,  we'll be able to announce them all.  Oh, do you think so?  I have a feeling, yeah.  We'll get them on the phone.  We'll see if they think they're close enough.  Okay.  And then maybe we'll have an announcement. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  It's the Homeless Shopping Spree 2 on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  Ah, yes.  You're checking out the Homeless Shopping Spree 2 on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Quickly, if you're not in the New York area and you're trying to get a hold of us today,  866-277-4WOW.  Opie, I'm on the website of the mall. 
[01:03:30]  That will be hosting the Homeless Shopping Spree.  Is it hosting if they don't know we're coming?  No.  But I don't know another word for it.  What a great bunch of stores that I'm looking at.  The health and beauty section alone.  Could you picture some of these guys maybe going to Bath and Body Works,  picking up something there?  Or maybe there's a nail place in there.  Maybe one of them could get a manicure or something. 
[01:04:00]  Or a pedicure.  Ugh.  Perfume places.  Cosmetics.  Maybe Tippi Tom could go in and ask,  what could I do to help my look?  Maybe there's some cosmetics he can purchase.  Then there's men's and women's fashions.  Plenty of the stores everyone's familiar with from the malls.  Banana Republic.  Ed Bauer.  Anthony, I've got to break in.  Yeah.  Because we are ready to announce the mall we're going to. 
[01:04:30]  Oh.  For the Homeless Shopping Spree, too.  Rick is on the bus.  Rick.  Yo, guys.  First of all, what's going on on the bus?  Actually, things have quieted down.  It seems like everyone except for Blue is taking a nap.  The only time they stir up is when we're on the phone and we F with them.  Yeah.  And as long as we don't let Keith know about it, it's okay.  We should have just got him a beer.  Can we start handing out the beer?  Because it seems like you guys are close now.  Let me ask Keith.  Where's Keith? 
[01:05:00]  Hey, Keith.  Can we start handing out the beers now?  He's giving me a...  No, not just yet.  What?  Not just yet.  Not just yet.  I knew that was going to happen.  I want to give one of them a beer.  I know he could get a great reaction if we give Rock and Roll Tommy a beer.  Just give Rock and Roll Tommy a beer.  Rock and Roll Tommy, come up front.  Oh, here we go.  That's him.  Come up, Tommy.  Give him a goddamn beer.  All right, Rick taking charge.  I like this.  Steve's on the bus from FoundryMusic.com getting some video, Anthony. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  The video and the pictures that we're going to have from today is going to be unbelievable.  Wow, what, Rick?  Come on.  What did Blue do?  Blue just attacked me like George.  Blue, Blue, chill now, man.  They're like wild animals.  You never know when they're just going to lunge at you.  That's hysterical.  He's just talking.  Whoa!  Are we going to put the kid leashes on all the homeless guys?  That would be funny if they had leashes. 
[01:06:00]  Keith right now is saying a rosary thing.  Please don't do this.  Hey, Rick, I've got to ask you.  I'm looking at the Opie and Anthony Homeless Shopping Spree supporters.  They don't want to be called sponsors.  They're all supporters today.  And one of them is Privileged Night Club.  And it says we're providing the girls.  What girls?  What girls, Rick?  The girls that never showed up on time.  I don't blame them.  Geez.  Of course.  What girls are going to want to go on a homeless bus?  We were going to put some strippers on the bus for the homeless shopping spree. 
[01:06:30]  I think they got wind of the idea and just decided to show up.  Of course.  That's a ridiculous idea.  All right.  So we're not going to hand out the beer, Rick?  We'll do it.  Rick.  Hold on.  I'll go to someone else as this phone clears up.  Let's go to the beer.  Ben.  Ben, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  We just nearly incited a riot when Rick yelled beer.  They all popped up.  Blue dove towards Rick like I've never seen before.  One funny note with Blue that Big Kev just alerted me of.  He, like, touched Mary on the shoulder or something, and Blue got up and got all pissed. 
[01:07:00]  So, like, Blue thinks that Mary is all his.  Oh, no.  A little jealous rage thrown in.  Oh, this is great.  Anyone following the bus at this point, Ben?  There was a bunch of cars with WOW stickers and stuff at some point.  It's hard to tell.  I'm right at the front of the bus now, but we did have six to ten when we started,  and I'm sure it's going on by now.  All right.  I've got to go back to Rick for a sec.  Hold on, all right?  Let me go back to Rick.  Rick.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  So what do you guys want me to do with this beer?  Keith, just say no.  Well, you know, I hate to go against Keith, but it's one beer for one guy.  What could it hurt?  How close are we to the mall?  We're, let's just say, we're past the point of no return.  Past exit 30.  Past exit 30.  Yep.  Okay.  And what's your ETA?  Say about 15 minutes.  All right.  See, no, they need a beer.  They need a beer, and we need to announce them all, I think, Rick. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, I think so, too.  Rick, just give Rock and Roll Tommy one beer.  All right.  Come on.  I'm adamant about this.  I want this to happen.  They want Rock and Roll Tommy to have a beer.  You're going to give it to one beer.  You're going to have to give it to all of them.  You're going to give it to one beer.  You're going to have to give it to all of them.  Did you hear that from Keith?  Yeah, I heard, but give him one beer.  Rick, Rick, Rick, this is what we want.  We understand what's going to happen.  We want you to give Rock and Roll Tommy a beer. 
[01:08:30]  Then we're going to get a crazy reaction, and then we'll hand out the beers.  Right.  All right.  So let me get this straight.  You want me to give Rock and Roll Tommy a beer.  Yeah.  Inside a riot on the bus with a bunch of homeless people.  Yeah.  While you guys are safe in the studio.  Right.  Yeah, that sounds like a plan.  Exactly.  Sure.  All right.  Hold on.  This is Keith.  While I'm standing here with Rick, Rick, let me just say a couple words to you.  Three of them, as a matter of fact.  Oh, wait a minute.  No, no.  This is legal, right?  Four words.  Remember those four words, Rick? 
[01:09:00]  Remember where the two guys on the phone were sitting when those four words came out?  Come on.  It was pure logistics.  Yeah.  As a consultant to the show, I'm going to say we're going to hold off on the beer a little  bit longer.  Oh, this sucks.  Only because I happen to know the ten people that we have in the back of this bus.  I know, but all we're saying is just give Rock and Roll Tommy one beer, and then when  they all want to have one, then we'll give them the rest.  Oh, good.  Before we get there, great idea. 
[01:09:30]  Great idea.  How much damage could one beer each do?  Trust me.  Trust me.  That's why we want to do it.  I know.  Trust me.  Keith, maybe that was...  Let's hold off on them for a little bit longer.  But you're almost there.  I understand that, and that's the beauty of it.  We're almost there.  All right.  Put Rick back on the phone.  There's no talking to you for some reason.  I don't understand Keith being the responsible one time.  I know.  Psycho Mark, what's up?  What's going on? 
[01:10:00]  I'm sitting back here with Tommy right now.  He looks like a pit bull waiting to fight for a body.  I'm so afraid we're going to have to take this bus over.  He's going to hijack the bus, he says.  Hi, everybody.  He wants to take the bus over.  He's growling.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let me go to Ben.  Ben, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm midway between the bus, right by the lovely couple, Blue and Mary.  Yeah.  You have a love check. 
[01:10:30]  Big Blue.  Big Blue in the house.  Big Blue is in the house.  He's with his lady.  Big Blue seems to be liking Mary.  Hey, Ben.  Yeah.  Walk up to Mary and just kind of put your hand in her hair and kind of, like, tussle with  her hair a little bit.  Hello, Ben?  All right.  Uh-oh.  Did Blue kill him?  Is that what happened?  Zombo, what's up?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, you got to get psyched on walk to, like, wake up Ziggy and say, holy cow, man. 
[01:11:00]  I can't believe we're in Florida already.  I bet there's warmer out there than here.  Very nice.  All right.  Let's go back to Rick.  Rick.  It's okay.  Nice.  Rick.  Yo.  Uh, you're on the air, Rick.  It's Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  All right.  All right, Rick.  Why don't you announce the mall?  All right.  For, uh, those who would like to join the Opie and Anthony homeless shopping spree, too,  we are going to Long Island's own Roosevelt Field Mall. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  Right in Garden City, Long Island.  Here we go.  There you go.  Right in Garden City, the home of Susan Lucci and many other people.  Yes.  Let me tell you something.  The Roosevelt Field Mall, uh, they redid it a little while back, and it is beautiful.  A huge, beautiful mall for plenty of stores.  With stores such as, uh, Gucci, um, Neyland Marcus, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's. 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  Nice stores to pick from.  Oh, of course.  All right.  And, Rick, when will you be at the mall?  Uh, we're going to be getting off the expressway any minute.  Oh, they're close, and they're close.  Why can't they have beer?  Ben's with Ziggy.  Let's talk to, uh, Ben and Ziggy.  Let's, uh, Ben, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Ziggy, uh, looks a little puzzled.  I just sat with him here, and he pulled his bag, uh, his big Bed Bath & Beyond bag away from me,  taking his territory.  And, uh, Ziggy, how you doing? 
[01:12:30]  Good, thanks.  Hey, man.  What the hell was that?  You're doing a little bit, man.  Whatever he said.  Oh, what the hell was that?  What's that?  I don't know what he even said.  I don't know.  He looks puzzled.  Oh, God, it just smells like, uh, like, uh, pee.  Ask him, ask him if he's excited about the shopping that he's about to do.  Ziggy, are you excited about the shopping you're going to do?  I didn't know.  I didn't see it again.  I was up with that before.  Ben, Ben, ask him if he has any clue where he is. 
[01:13:00]  Ziggy, do you have any clue where you are?  Yeah, I don't know that much, of course.  Oh, wow, all right.  He knows where he is.  A little more coherent than we thought, isn't he?  Yeah.  All right, he knows he's on Long Island somewhere.  Ask Ziggy if he needs a beer, Ben.  Ziggy, do you want a beer?  I don't know if anybody else will love one.  Listen to him.  I'm telling you, he's a man.  I don't think there'd be a problem.  I want to talk to, um, rock and roll Tommy. 
[01:13:30]  Okay, here he is.  Rock and roll Tommy.  Sure.  Can I have my beer now, please?  Rock and roll Tommy.  Can I have my beer now, please?  Tommy, you want a beer, don't you?  Can I have my beer now, please?  He wants his beer.  I want to give you a beer.  They're telling me no.  No.  Keith, Keith, is he on duty?  Keith's on duty.  He is on duty.  Yeah, sort of. 
[01:14:00]  They're, uh, they're staring now.  All right, hold on a minute, bro.  Rock and roll Tommy really needs a beer, Anthony.  I don't understand why, uh...  Rick.  Yo.  All right, uh, how close to the mall?  Because I want to time out this break here.  Um, we've got about one more mile, and we're going to get off the expressway.  Yeah.  And, uh, Keith is still frowning very, very disapprovingly at the idea of giving them  beer.  I'm working, I'm working on Keith.  I'm not getting anywhere, though.  One beer each is not going to cause them to, uh, go crazy.  Keith, one beer each. 
[01:14:30]  They'll finish it by the time we get there.  Everybody will be in a festive holiday mood.  What do you think?  One beer.  Yeah.  One beer.  Let the homeless drink.  Let the homeless drink.  Let the homeless drink.  Let the homeless drink.  Let the homeless drink.  All right.  Let the homeless drink.  Blue!  Blue!  Merry Christmas, Blue.  Here's a beer.  Oh, listen.  Listen to how they love the beer.  Hello? 
[01:15:00]  Hey.  Merry Christmas.  Blue, Merry Christmas.  Yeah.  I'll be on my way.  You're digging the beer, huh?  And you have a red compass for Big Blue.  Hey, Blue, you liking Mary on the bus there?  Hey, all right, well, you can't ask him any questions.  Give it to Rock and Roll Tommy.  Tommy's all, I can't reach Rock and Roll Tommy right now.  Oh, no?  He's all the way to the back.  Hey, guys, guys, you're all going to get a beer now. 
[01:15:30]  Hey!  You guys still there?  Yeah.  All right, I'm with Rock and Roll Tommy.  Tommy, are you ready to grab your beer?  Yes, I'm ready.  There we go.  Sure, a little holiday cheer.  That's what it is.  It's a festive thing.  Just one little beer.  Rock and Roll Tommy.  Rock and Roll Tommy.  Nobody opens the beer and told me. 
[01:16:00]  Thank you, God, Brian.  God bless you.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to go to Ben as they try to open up Rock and Roll Tommy's beer.  Ben, what's up?  I'm right in front of Ziggy and Poitice.  You look happy.  Cracked that beer open about 2.2 seconds.  And probably just drank almost half of it in two gulps.  I'm the homeless man to drink.  A big smile on the zigzag face.  And, Jeff, we've created pandemonium.  They're now toasting to the homeless.  To the homeless.  It's just sort of pandemonium.  To the homeless.  To the homeless. 
[01:16:30]  Now they're trying to keep.  Dude, they were sleeping a few minutes ago.  You just add a little beer.  Now they're all having fun.  Yeah, it's great.  I mean, Ziggy just looks so happy.  And so does the whole crew.  Rock and Roll Tommy is looking like Beavis and Butt-Head right now with the beer in there.  He's banging his head.  He's going a little crazy in the back of the bus.  There you go.  Oh, this is what we need for our radio show today.  A little excitement.  Where's Norton?  Norton's right here. 
[01:17:00]  Here's Norton.  Norton is just.  Thank God, because a blind guy checking in from D.C. saying, who's effing show is this?  He goes, is it the Opie and Anthony show or the Keith the Cop show?  There you go.  Keith is ruining your show.  All right, Norton, what's up?  Norton.  Yeah.  What's going on, bro?  Well, I just took a leak in the bathroom, and I'm walking my way back up, and all the  homeless have beer now, which is always a bright idea, I think, because the alcohol hasn't  really damaged them at all, so it's nice to feed them some on the way to a nice mall. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  I just got to, I'm going to give you back the bank.  I got to wipe out alcohol rub on my hand, because I was holding on to that handle, so I  didn't fall into the toilet.  Right.  I got to clean my hand.  It's amazing.  I bang hookers without bags, and it doesn't bother me.  Yeah.  Now that I touch this thing, I'm going to wash my hands.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Listen to how much fun.  Oh, no.  More fun.  Yeah, hell yeah.  Sulp and ammonium.  All right.  Hey, Ben.  Oh, jeez.  Blue keeps touching me. 
[01:18:00]  He's very touchy-feely.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, no.  Hey, Ben.  Yeah.  Ask Rick how long before we get to the mall, because I want to take a quick  break here.  Uh, Rick.  I don't even see where Rick is.  How long until we get to the mall, wherever it is.  Come on, take it out.  Ben, look.  Oh, good.  There's a huge van right now beside us with a huge, wow, white van.  Guys going nuts out the window right beside us.  I'm crazy here.  Wow.  All over this van.  This is a wow van. 
[01:18:30]  Nice.  How much time, Rick?  Less than 15.  Less than 15 minutes away.  All right, Ben.  Then, no.  Oh, my God.  This guy's going to, this guy's going to side swipe us.  What a sicko.  He's sharing.  We got a huge caravan now.  All right, good.  God, they'll all be there shopping along with the homeless today.  This guy isn't even paying attention to how he's driving.  He's just got his hand out the window.  He's on his cell phone giving us a thumbs up.  He is not even paying attention to driving.  All right, man. 
[01:19:00]  All right, guys.  All right, thank you, Ben.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Well, it's heating up.  Eddie, what's up?  Yo, listen.  I'm coming down Stewart Avenue towards the mall when I heard you announce it.  I kind of anticipated.  Yeah.  Two minutes later, Nantau County cops flying by, lights and sirens, heading for the mall.  Oh, stop it.  I swear to God.  I'm sure it's a coincidence.  Back to back.  All right, well, we'll see what happens.  Thank you, Eddie. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  All right, bye.  And let's go to Vinny really fast.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I'm doing deliveries.  I'm stuck in gridlock traffic.  I see the bus go by.  Yeah.  36 cars in unison just start honking and going nuts.  Nice.  Some girl gets out of a car and starts wowing the bus.  Yeah, isn't that great?  Cool.  That's amazing.  All right, thank you, Vinny, for the report.  See you later.  We ought to take a break because we are definitely going to want to be live when they pull into the  Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island.  We'll be there in less than 10 minutes.  Right after these. 
[01:20:00]  The Opie and Anthony Homeless Shopping Spree is supported by Ski Stop, Lane View, Long Island,  516-249-7980.  And Riverhead Ford, Lincoln Mercury, Route 58, Riverhead, New York, 631-727-2200.  Opie and Anthony, 1027.  WNEW.  You're checking out the homeless shopping spree, too, on the Opie and Anthony program.  Where are we at right now, Anthony?  Oh, my God. 
[01:20:30]  The bus moments away from its destination, Roosevelt Field Mall.  And last we heard, the guys were enjoying just a little holiday cheer, one beer each.  And they're all psyched and ready to do some Christmas shopping.  A couple of instant feedbacks.  Walt Whitman Mall checking in, Anthony.  Yeah.  Thank you for leaving me alone.  And see you next Tuesday from the city.  Giving out beer to these homeless guys is like dropping humanitarian aid packages on Afghanistan. 
[01:21:00]  What a patriotic moment for this show.  And Jay checking in from New York City.  He says, 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.  Take one down, pass it around.  17 cases of hib on the bus.  Corey, what's going on?  How you doing, gentlemen?  All right.  I hate to be the bearer of that dude, but my connections at Roosevelt Field tell me there are cops and security guarding every exit.  Well, what can they possibly do?  There's people that want to go shopping. 
[01:21:30]  They're just going shopping.  Yes, there are.  I'm just, you know, I just figured I'd lay it in.  Well, a lot of our listeners are heading down to the mall now.  I hope they can start a chant, let the homeless shop.  Let the homeless shop.  Let the homeless shop.  Let the homeless shop.  All right.  Thank you.  You are very welcome.  Later, precious.  All right.  The phones are exploding, Anthony.  John, what's going on?  Hey, John.  Hey, guys.  I'm on old country, man.  And they are racing, man.  They are racing down to the mall. 
[01:22:00]  Come on.  I'm dead serious, bro.  It's all over.  You know, they're going down.  They're national cops.  They've got nothing else to do, guys.  There is no law that says that some people cannot take a little shopping trip.  Think about what you're talking about.  You're talking about Long Island.  I don't care.  Fuck up little people who drive around in Mommy and Daddy's Bend.  Oh, precious.  You're spoiled, too.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  But, yeah.  No, they're all there, man.  They're racing down there.  It's going to be brutal.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:22:30]  Let me go to Jimmy.  Mall security at the mall, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Jimmy, are you at Roosevelt Field Mall?  Yeah.  What's up, Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Who?  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, they just called me back into work.  I'm a security guard at Roosevelt Mall.  They're going to clamp down on you guys.  Like how?  They're not going to let you guys go in.  And what is going to be their...  They're going to watch the entrance for the buses, and they're going to have the cops check the bus on you guys and everything.  What's going to be the reason?  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  They just called us all back.  Did they call them?  They told me to get back and guard the gate. 
[01:23:00]  Is it true they called a red alert, Jimmy?  Yes.  Red alert?  I said there is a red alert down here.  What does a red alert entail?  It's like high security.  They just don't want...  They think you guys are going to go crazy in the mall.  Jimmy, is there something higher than a red alert?  I have no idea.  This is the first time I heard of it.  I mean, people with guns should be a red alert in the mall.  A terrorist invasion is a red alert.  I got a pestle neck dick running around screaming and yelling at us to not to let you guys in at all. 
[01:23:30]  Haven't people been listening to the show?  We're going to behave ourselves today.  I hope so.  I think it's great, man.  I'm even going to give some bucks to the homeless.  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Let's go to Kevin.  The bus is checking in.  We'll get to him in a second here.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Boney?  Hey.  I'm at the mall right now.  Yeah.  There are mounted cops on horses.  Stop it.  Helicopters.  Yeah, sure.  I swear to God. 
[01:24:00]  Get out of here.  There's a helicopter.  There's no way there's a helicopter.  And police on horses.  Helicopter.  Where's...  Look, let's get to the bottom.  All right.  Let's go right to Ben.  Oh, let's check it in two here.  Ben, what's up?  Ben.  All right.  Let's go jamming up frequencies, Opie.  Let's go to Rick.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's happening?  We're about a mile away.  Do you see any cops, Rick?  I see no police.  I see no helicopters.  I don't know what this guy's talking about.  Of course.  I think they're just making us freak out a little bit. 
[01:24:30]  Everyone likes doing that, because any time we do something, people always talk about  all the cops that are there and showing up.  And the only time it was true was when everyone got arrested.  This is kind of like that Apollo mission when it had to go around the...  What was it?  The sun?  Oh, the moon.  Oh, the moon.  And we lost...  Loss of signal.  Loss of signal and communications.  With the Apollo.  Right.  And now we're just holding our breath, hoping that we can get into the mall here.  Yeah.  So, Rick, what's going on on the bus?  Right now, we're just pretty much gathering up all our stuff, because we're coming up to 
[01:25:00]  the main entrance of the mall.  Everybody's making sure they've got their phones.  We've got the cameras all set.  Everybody's making sure that they've accounted for their homeless.  The homeless have been assigned to different people.  I don't know if you want me to go through who's got...  No, no, no.  Hold on a second.  Rick, hold on for one second.  Where are we?  There's a lady on a roof.  Sue, what's going on?  Hi.  I'm on the roof of Bloomingdale.  Yeah.  And I'm parked up here. 
[01:25:30]  There's no security up here, but there's definitely...  There was a helicopter in the sky, and I see yellow flashing lights by that big Charles  Lindbergh statue when you drive in.  Okay.  And I'm just waiting for the bus.  I'm doing my work, and I was in the area circling the mall, thinking and hoping you'd  say Roosevelt Field, and here I am, so I'm waiting.  There's a lot of entrances to the mall.  I can't imagine if they could block every entrance, Anthony.  Of course.  The roof of Bloomingdale's is always a good place to park.  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  So I'm up here.  Well, thank you, Sue.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  If you see anything, calls back.  Well, I'm going to keep you on hold for a minute.  Hold on.  All right.  Sue's on the roof, Anthony.  Let's go to Bob.  Bob, what's up?  Hey, can't you guys abort the mission and head over to an undisclosed location, another  mall?  No.  Well, the fun of this is to have our listeners help the homeless.  Right.  You know, we only gave you guys, like, a ten-minute head start.  That's ten minutes too much, my friend.  Yeah, that's what we're starting to figure out.  But all right.  Thank you, Bob.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Let me go to Ed. 
[01:26:30]  Ed, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Ed's inside the mall.  You're in the mall, Ed?  Yeah, listen.  I just walked outside the door.  The security's not that high at all.  The mall looks normal.  Nobody has a clue.  Okay.  There you go.  Of course.  I think people are trying to panic.  I just walked out by Sam Goody.  And there's nothing going on here.  There's a couple of cops walking around, but nothing extraordinary.  See, people are trying to freak us out.  Yeah, I did see a helicopter when I came in, but I think I was just passing by. 
[01:27:00]  Coincidence.  Let me go back to Rick.  Thank you, Ed.  Let's talk to Rick on the bus.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  We're just coming.  Like I said, we're just hitting up like every light, it seems, before we get to the mall.  But we're coming up fast.  A lot of people following the bus at this point?  Yeah, we've had plenty of idiots almost sideswip us and then drive themselves into a tree, which is always a nice treat.  But it seems to have calmed down right now since we hit some traffic and some lights.  All right.  All right. 
[01:27:30]  Hold on.  I'm going to check in with Ben.  Hold on.  All right.  So they're stuck in traffic, Anthony, and some lights there.  Ben, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  That phone sucks.  Yeah, Ben, your phone's blown.  Ron's checking and saying, I was at the Lincoln Tunnel and saw them pulling back the National Guardsmen,  putting them on Humvees, and heading to Long Island.  And there are reports that NORAD is scrambling fighters to head to the mall.  People, stop it. 
[01:28:00]  Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  We're just stuck in a little bit of traffic just before the mall.  All the holiday shoppers and probably a good portion of our listeners are tying up,  things, to try and get there.  Yeah, okay.  Did you want me to go through who's got a homeless guy or whatever?  No, no.  That's all right.  All right.  You know what, Rick?  Hold on.  Someone's going to pick you up.  And as soon as you see the mall, we're going to go right back to you, all right?  No problem.  Someone talk to him, and we'll go through some of these calls in the meantime. 
[01:28:30]  Aaron, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  On my way to the mountain, horseback, true.  Helicopter circling overhead, true.  But now it disappeared.  And there's about 30 to 40 people jockeying for position to try and follow this bus.  Oh, really?  It is effing hysterical.  People are sitting up.  They're tailgating.  I'm waiting to see a hibachi out here.  Well, this is quite an event when the homeless bus actually pulls up. 
[01:29:00]  It's such a sight to behold, all the fans there.  That's quite a sight.  You're going to be hearing honking and screaming like Ozzy just walked in.  Well, he did.  His name is Ziggy this week.  Ozzy.  All right.  Dennis, thank you.  No problem, brothers.  That is the deal right there.  We got to the bottom of where the cops were going, Anthony.  Sue on the roof.  Sue?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  You know, I don't see the bus yet, but you know what's funny?  There's a big office building next to the mall, and the number is 666.  Oh, yeah?  Blowing overhead, waiting for the bus to come. 
[01:29:30]  Of course.  I'm looking forward to meeting Ziggy personally.  Maybe we'll sing a duet.  You know, I'll definitely catch up with the gang later.  Are you going to check them out?  Oh, absolutely.  Ziggy?  Absolutely.  We're going to go put on makeup.  Yeah, Ziggy's a man, but you got to check out Tippi Tom and Rock and Roll Tom.  Oh, boy.  Okay, there's a bunch of guys here cheering and shouting with me on the roof now.  Great.  It's a beautiful night, and, you know, we're really excited.  I'm glad you chose Roosevelt Field.  Yeah, give them a great welcome when they pull up. 
[01:30:00]  I will.  All right.  Thank you, Sue.  Thanks, guys.  Bye-bye.  All right, bye.  Let's go back to...  Wait, quickly, Matt from Bay Ridge says,  I learned that Norton will bang hookers without a condom,  but won't touch the hold-on bar in the bathroom of a bus.  What?  Psycho.  We don't want more beer.  Oh, they want more beer.  We want more beer.  We want more beer.  It's the excitement is building.  They all have their T-shirts on, and they're all numbered. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, there are...  1, 17, 3, 4...  They have homeless shopping spree T-shirts that were made up,  and they're all numbered, so we can keep track of them  without the personalization of a name or something.  We just gave them numbers.  Now, might I remind anyone who's going to be showing up at the mall,  feel free to buy plenty of gifts for these guys and donations.  Of course.  You just buy them a pair of sneakers.  Oh, feel free to need shoes and coats and all that stuff.  We need beer.  We need beer. 
[01:31:00]  We need beer.  You can care less about the clothing bar beer.  That's why they're on the street.  They'd rather buy beer.  We should have got the kid leashes, Anthony.  I'm telling you.  Yeah, you know, you ever go through the stores,  and you see the mother, and she's got a kid on a leash  with this big chest harness?  Imagine if we had 10 of those  leading the homeless around on leashes.  Can we even see the mall at this point?  Yeah, how close?  Can we see the mall, Dirk?  No.  This friggin' traffic's impossible.  I know it sucks. 
[01:31:30]  I can't do it anywhere.  I can't even do it.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Big Dog from Seaford's saying,  you guys should know,  the homeless probably won't even get noticed at that mall.  You're in Hempstead.  No.  The neighborhood is one thing.  That mall is a garden spot.  That mall has been redone.  There are some very upper-class stores there.  Oh, yeah.  Believe it.  Yeah, it's very nice.  Tim, what's up?  Yeah, I just was making a comment  that this convoy is incredibly impressive. 
[01:32:00]  You do have people sort of driving people off into the bushes  just to keep up.  And they're about a mile away.  You guys are, like, almost home free.  Yeah.  And it's unfortunate.  Yesterday, Brooks Brothers had a 30% off sale.  You guys could have really racked up.  Oh, they could have helped out the homeless  if they wanted to buy a suit.  I just passed the Coral Limousine.  I'm right next to them right now.  And these guys are raring to go, man.  Good luck.  All right.  Thank you, Tim.  Happy holidays, guys. 
[01:32:30]  You too.  All right.  Well, this is the longest mile.  Jay saying that they have numbers on.  Put me down for Buttered Roll, Tippy Tom, and Ziggy for the trifecta.  I should play those numbers for the hell of it.  Play their numbers.  Carlos, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, I just took a little walk through the mall just now.  There is a ton of undercover here.  The entire mall is freaking out.  Oh.  You guys coming here.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know.  They called out the reserves here, man. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  You can't buy advertising like this today.  Of course.  Talking about how nice the mall is and how they redid it.  I just want to say you guys are doing a great job, man.  All right, Carlos.  This is great radio.  Cool.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  But they're killing us.  They're stuck in traffic.  I know.  We want them to be there.  Get to the mall.  Doc, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I'm sitting at the west entrance right now.  There's nobody here.  There's a Salvation Army Santa who looks homeless himself.  It's like a family of 18 Indians all wandering around. 
[01:33:30]  Nobody.  There's nobody here.  Cops, my ass.  All right.  Good.  Good to hear.  Thank you.  Just a comfort for Mary.  She's going to be a figment in Blue's mind because there's a lot of fine Jap mommies out  tonight, man.  All right.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  Pull.  Pull.  There he goes.  Second Mark.  Can I tell you one thing?  There's one guy in a van that's been following us the whole time.  Cool.  We turned off at the LIE.  He kept going straight.  Stop.  Stop. 
[01:34:00]  Pull the tunnel, Anthony.  Goes over to Carter.  Comes around.  Keep following us.  Goes over to Bush's.  What a nut.  Well, he's got to be involved.  Totally involved.  Fully involved.  Dougie asked with his license plate.  What a moron.  Look at this.  Brian, who works at Chili's, I believe, in the mall.  Yeah, hold on a second.  Let me go to Brian on line 10 here.  Brian, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  How you doing?  All right.  All right.  I'm with Chili's Restaurant.  We got a restaurant there on Old Country Road.  Oh, you're not in the mall, though? 
[01:34:30]  No, it's only outskirts of the mall.  It's hard enough to get these guys in one spot.  Yeah?  Yeah, we got to get them to the mall.  But thanks for the offer.  He was going to give them free food, Anthony.  Free food.  See?  Psycho Mark, where's Rick or Ben or Jim Norton?  They're in front of the bus.  They're sort of mellowed out at the moment.  They're sort of just patiently awaiting the arrival here because it's really torture.  I know.  We're kind of in a hole in the mall.  I can see the mall.  I mean, I can see the goddamn stores from here, but we're real close.  We're going to be pulling in any minute.  There we are right now. 
[01:35:00]  All right.  Hold on.  I'm going right to Rick because Rick's saying the mall's coming up.  Rick knows Long Island.  A little more than Psycho Mark.  Rick, what's up?  Guys, we are now about to enter.  What the hell is...  He's stopping.  He's stopping for you, ass.  Who's big?  What?  We're about to pull into the main entrance of the...  Where are we going?  Where do I feel them all?  And this idiot just stops for no reason.  Holy fan.  All right. 
[01:35:30]  So what's up?  But here we go.  We're making the right.  Okay.  And the beautiful...  There it is.  Look at everybody.  Look at the mall.  Woo!  As we pull into the Roosevelt Field Mall.  Hey, Rick, where are you in the mall?  Because the place is huge.  And we are being met by the Nassau County Police Department.  Go straight.  Go straight.  He's got his light flash.  He's just sitting there.  And he's following us.  We're going to make a left up here.  Hey, Rick, what part of the mall are you at? 
[01:36:00]  Because the place is huge.  We are at the main entrance.  Now we're getting it.  Now we're...  Wow.  There's a lot of people flashing lights at us.  There is a group of cars...  Yeah, we're going to make a left.  A group of cars on our left who have just gathered in mass.  It's like they've been tailgating in the parking lot waiting for the bus to arrive.  We heard that from someone else.  It's incredible.  All right, guys.  Steve.  Steve, let's get video of these guys over here on the left.  Okay.  Okay.  What's going on with the cops?  All right.  See, I don't know. 
[01:36:30]  He got out.  He's pulled off the side and is following us but hasn't done anything.  He hasn't turned on his siren at all.  He's just giving him a little escort.  Yeah, we haven't done anything wrong yet.  It almost looks like the submarine race is in the 50s.  Did I say yet?  I'm waiting for that low volume.  We're in the bus.  Guys, there's a police force thing here, too.  Yeah.  There's a police truck and a horse, too.  Well, we're hearing that's normal, Rick. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  No, it's not.  I shop at this place.  I've never seen that before.  No, our listeners have said that's very normal.  Goddamn, Rick.  I love just hearing his voice on the phone from a bus because it sounds exactly like it did last year.  Guys, guys, if something gets ugly, I'm out of here.  I don't care.  Rick's going to go back to his roots as a Puerto Rican and run.  Exactly.  All right.  All right.  We're going to keep going this way. 
[01:37:30]  I'm curious.  I want to know if Norton's freaking out or not.  Yeah, Norton's got to be a little nervous about the cop cars.  Is there a lot of fun?  Is there a car over there?  Hit me right lane.  Right lane.  Okay, we do suck.  We're never out there.  We're in the comfort of Das Bunker here at the studio.  Right here.  Right here.  And here we come.  We're passing Nordstrom on our right.  Yeah, right here.  Right here.  All right, Rick, hold on a second.  I'll go right back to you in a second.  They're trying to figure out where to park.  But Sergeant... 
[01:38:00]  Klain?  What's up?  Sergeant Klain.  Yes, how you doing, Opie and Anthony?  All right, what's up?  Hey, long-time listener, listen.  I want to give you a fair warning that there is a cop car waiting for you.  It's undercover.  As soon as that vehicle comes to a complete stop, it will be searched for open containers  of alcohol.  Yeah.  Okay, so just fair warning.  I'm giving you a fair warning, gentlemen.  All right, thank you, Sergeant Klain.  Let me go back to Rick.  Rick.  Rick.  All right, guys, we are now pulling up in front of Houlihan's Restaurant and Bar. 
[01:38:30]  Rick.  We are going to be disembarking our bus and entering the mall.  Rick.  Rick.  Yeah.  Get rid of the empties.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Stop.  Stop.  Wait.  Listen.  It's like a mad rush.  Rick.  Yo.  Just make sure the empties are in some kind of a bag.  Just make sure the empties aren't just laying out.  I'm all over it, dude.  All right.  All right.  We're disembarking the bus.  What empties, Anthony?  They're homeless weren't really drinking.  You're allowed to have empties in a vehicle. 
[01:39:00]  It's just how they are.  That's right.  You know, you've got to bring your empties back to the store for a deposit with your car.  You just can't have them sitting on your passenger seat half full or between your legs  still cold.  That's how it works.  Why is Rick very quiet?  Rick?  Yeah.  We've had one of the police cars pull up.  We're having our head of security go and talk to them.  This is exactly what the guy said?  Rick.  Rick?  Yeah.  Say it for us.  This is legal, isn't it? 
[01:39:30]  All right.  So our security...  Guys, we literally have a caravan of cars following us.  This is incredible.  This is great.  We're doing such good.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  At this point, I think everyone should start to chant, let the homeless shop.  Well, Elliot, there's some kind of problem.  You know what?  People are stuck.  Because we just announced it seconds ago, as to what entrance we're using in this place  has a lot of entrances. 
[01:40:00]  People are now running towards us.  Oh, great.  Hey, the Beatles have made it to them all.  I'm going to get off the phone.  This is legal, isn't it?  No, Rick, you can't get off the phone.  All right.  Pull the bus up.  We're going to pull the bus up.  We're trying to work everything out with the law enforcement officials here.  All right.  Pull the bus up, Rick.  How are you?  Well, I'm still not jailed yet.  Oh.  They're beeping like crazy, Anthony.  Hey, everybody's phone?  Hey, Rick. 
[01:40:30]  Why don't you get the phone to Ben, and you can check it out, make sure everything's going  We're, you know, going okay up there.  Hey, Ben?  Yes.  What's up?  Ben?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Dude, it's so a patrimonium.  You should have seen, as we pulled in, lights flashing up a storm.  Everyone was waiting to find the ball.  Now the caravan has continued, and they're all parking.  People are just throwing their cars all over the place.  Total madness.  People with cameras, dude, just cheering.  Here's a maniac.  This guy's a sicko.  Dougie F.  Dougie F.  We're almost smashed into the bus like three times. 
[01:41:00]  It's total panamonic.  This is great.  This is totally nuts, and we're working everything out.  We're about to say it to them all.  Very good.  People are suggesting...  Great crowd.  Great crowd here.  People are suggesting Voss get out and do his act, because that guy can't get arrested.  Dude, let me just tell you one other thing about Jim Norton.  I heard the stories about Norton on the cab ride to breakfast when we were up in Boston.  Yeah.  He was going nuts.  God damn it.  Who planned this? 
[01:41:30]  Why did it take two hours?  God damn it.  Pull over.  What the hell, dude?  He is going bananas.  He gets stir-crazy.  Bananas.  Dude, me and Voss were just laughing our ass off.  I said to Norton, he should put on a tape.  He killed him just in a bus.  Losing his mind.  He was going nuts.  So here's Voss right now.  Here's Voss.  Check in.  Voss.  What's happening?  Voss, hold on for one second.  Hold on for one second.  Hold on for one second.  Let me go to Jay.  Jay, what's up?  Jay, real fast.  Yeah, I got nothing on here on the scanner.  The cars are coming for you.  More cars?  Are you coming to the mall? 
[01:42:00]  Police cars.  Oh, why is that?  They're coming from the accident on Old Country Road.  They're being sent over there.  Why is that?  A couple of police cars switching up to the supervisor's frequency, too.  All right, well.  I understand it.  You know, they're just, they're making sure everything stays organized.  And I don't blame them.  That's all.  There's a lot of people there, so they're just keeping everything organized.  So, uh, they're sending more cars.  It's pandemonium out here.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  What's up, Voss?  It's unbelievable.  I'm going right now straight to Bed Bath & Beyond and buying some soap. 
[01:42:30]  Unbelievable.  Look at all the people.  They all got cameras.  It's unbelievable.  I think the homeless are scared to come out of the cage.  Well, are we allowed to leave the bus?  Why are we doing this at 5.30?  All of this should have been finished.  They're putting shirts on these thumbs.  Thank you.  Nice rack.  Are you guys on?  Can I even hear you?  Yes, we're hearing you, Norris.  Dude, if you ever try to book something this far away from the city again, I will firebomb the studio.  Tora Bora would have been easier to get to. 
[01:43:00]  I am tired.  All right, I can't hear anything.  All right.  Big Kev on it.  Also, he won't eat.  Oh, my God.  Big Kev on it.  Homeless.  They're chanting homeless.  They're beeping horns.  Boy, for 15 or 20 minutes notice, they got quite the crowd there.  It's incredible.  Yeah, but no one listens to us anymore, Anthony. 
[01:43:30]  Who's on the phone?  Let the homeless shop.  Let the homeless shop.  Oh, we lost their phone.  We lost their phone.  We lost their phone.  But Psycho Mark is on another phone.  Yeah, I'm right here.  How's it going, Mark?  Good.  It's not really over here.  Everyone's chanting.  Let the homeless shop.  It's a funeral thing.  It's just people everywhere.  The cops are very happy.  They all have smiles on their faces.  Everything's nice, nice.  Everything's going well, though?  Everything is nice, nice.  I think we're going to have a fantastic time. 
[01:44:00]  Hey, can you hear them, Ted?  Here we go.  Okay, deny these wonderful people the opportunity to find good things.  All right.  Let's go.  Let the water go, Mark.  Let the water go, Mark.  Ben!  Oh, my God.  Ben!  Ben, no one can hear us, Opie.  Oh, no.  There's nuts.  Hundreds of people here.  I don't know if you guys can even hear me, but they're getting nuts. 
[01:44:30]  Absolutely pandemonium here.  We're about to unload the bus and into the mall, man.  Total crazy crowd.  Huge crowd.  Nice.  Great, great.  And Ms. Fox is trying to sell a CD.  Let me go to Rick.  More.  Hey, Rick.  Rick.  Guys.  What's up, Rick?  We are just about ready to announce and let the crowd meet the homeless.  Oh, great.  This is always good.  Personal introduction portion.  Are you ready? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  We're ready.  Thank you.  All right.  Hey, guys.  You guys ready to meet the homeless?  We're here for Big Blue.  It's Big Blue.  It's Big Blue.  That's just rock size.  Again for Mickey Tom.  Oh, my God.  The block.  Oh, my God.  Burn.  Burn.  Oh, my God. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, my God.  Again for Andre.  Andre didn't really get that much of an ovation.  Uh-oh.  Saving the best for luck.  Everybody let it roll.  He's the ring on the band.  Let it roll.  They like let it roll.  It's Jimmy.  It's Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  That's it.  Like Robert Plant just hit the stage.  It's Jimmy Tom. 
[01:46:00]  It's Jimmy Tom.  It's Jimmy Tom.  It's Jimmy Tom.  It's Jimmy Tom.  It's Jimmy Tom.  It's Jimmy Tom.  They're god damn rock stars.  Big Ed.  Big Ed.  They don't like Big Ed that much.  Everybody, it's Youngblood.  Youngblood.  Youngblood.  They don't know Youngblood.  And here is two. 
[01:46:30]  They're going to eat big dollars.  All right, guys.  We are ready to go shopping.  All right.  Thank God.  Hey, you guys ready to go shopping?  Yeah.  There they go.  Here we go.  Frank's saying Rick should have done his Bob Shepard impression.  Now shopping number one, Ziggy.  Rick's a fag, Rick's a fag, Rick's a fag chant. 
[01:47:00]  Always a favorite whenever Rick's out.  Ben, what's up?  Guys, I've never smelled more people as being in the crowd surrounded by these ten guys.  It is the worst I've ever smelled.  We're ready to get to the mall here.  We're just getting our crews together.  Yeah.  And so we're going to head in.  We're right by Houlihan's.  Okay.  And heading into the mall.  You should see it, dude.  There's a walkway up above, like 20 feet above us.  And it's just filled with people looking down. 
[01:47:30]  That's madness.  Totally nuts.  Ziggy, of course, huge crowd saver.  Do you know how many photos you think of Ziggy is unbelievable?  They love Ziggy.  Ziggy looks like something out of the new Lord of the Rings movie, doesn't he?  It's a kind of hobbit-like troll thing in a down jacket.  All right, guys.  We're heading into the mall.  We'll call you back in a little bit.  All right.  Thank you, Ben.  Wow.  What a greeting that they got from the people at Roosevelt Field Mall.  Wonderful.  I think they all hung up. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, they all hung up.  They're going to go inside, and we're going to get a report on them.  Hello.  Marion?  That's me.  Hi.  What's up, guys?  I'm looking in with the masses now.  There are parents with children terrified.  You can't even imagine.  I mean, you're talking the snootiest.  I mean, all right, Short Hills is very snooty, but this is like the snooty capital of Long Island.  Yeah.  Terrified.  People are pushing their cars. 
[01:48:30]  They're not even putting them in.  They're throwing the kids in the car and pushing them out of the parking lot.  Sorry, get out of the way.  Oh, my God.  I'm here.  I'm going to look for Ben, and I'm going to buy somebody some sneakers.  Oh, there you go.  That's cool.  Of course.  Why not?  It's the Christmas spirit.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  You guys watch.  Have a great, great show.  Uh-oh.  Wait.  Something's going on.  Uh-oh.  Wait.  Let me go to Psycho Mark, because I think it has something to do with him.  Psycho Mark.  Mark.  Mark.  I'm trying to get Tommy to put a cigarette out before we get in the mall here. 
[01:49:00]  We're just sitting in the mall now, and it's in the mall, and it's unbelievable.  It's just like a swarm of people.  It's just a thing of beauty.  That's fantastic.  Here's Rick on the phone.  Rick, what's up?  All right.  Big Blue has already found the company that's asking for change.  Keep walking.  Get rid of the cup.  He can't panhandle.  All right.  It's like, what have you done?  He can't panhandle.  He's getting $100. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, look at that.  As they make their way in, the people applauding.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  And you can hear, we're walking through the mall to cheers.  There are people everywhere.  They seem to really like the homeless shopping spritz.  Unbelievable.  And you can hear balloons in the house.  Yes, yes.  They are wild.  I like rock stars, these guys.  Let me go back to Marion, because she was like,  Uh-oh.  Marion.  Oh, my God.  We just walked past the children. 
[01:50:00]  You were talking about having them do the portraits.  Yeah.  So we just walked past the picture people's store,  and there's like a bunch of kids and parents  holding their children so tight that half of the kids' faces are red  from lack of oxygen.  You cannot believe what's going on in here.  This is so cool.  Oh, that's great.  This is so cool.  You guys, go talk to somebody else,  because I'm going to lose you as soon as the screaming starts again.  All right.  There goes Marion.  Oh, what a shame.  I wanted to hear.  Is that a Long Island accent? 
[01:50:30]  Did I detect a hint of it?  A little bit.  Well, you're going to play some sneakies for somebody.  A little bit.  Michael Mark, what's up?  Guys.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  All plenty of what's to do is go to the bar.  You want to spend all this money?  You want to go to the bar?  In the bar?  Well, who are we to tell them what he can and can't do?  That's what I said.  I said, let's go to the bar.  There's a bar right when they walk in.  Great.  We're going to make it a beeline for the bar.  He's getting inside a big gas. 
[01:51:00]  It's being unbelievable.  There's a path on display here.  And he's just jumped in a tub.  What?  He's jumping in the displays?  Tommy.  Drunk and old Tommy just jumped in this big tub display.  It's right here on display in the middle of the bar.  A big tub.  A tub.  I don't think he's seen a tub since 1914.  So we're looking for the bar.  We're heading to a spacey right now.  It's sort of like a huge conglomerate.  Everyone's hanging out together.  Right.  And walking around.  We sort of, we're going to pretend I'm splitting up in the group. 
[01:51:30]  I don't think that's going to happen.  No, you guys got to make sure you hit all the great spots.  We need someone at the perfume place, maybe a cosmetics thing.  Maybe go over to Macy's or where they do the portraits for children.  Have little Ziggy holding a toy.  You know, this is really a nice mall.  They really did do it.  Oh, yeah.  It's beautiful there.  We told you.  It hit the crapper first, at least, because it's so nice.  I don't think they've been in the bathroom for that long.  It's just nice.  Oh, it's probably like going to a hotel room for them. 
[01:52:00]  Just the bathroom.  Oh, there's dancing going on somewhere.  You can just sit to hundreds of people showing up.  Like, it's just, everyone's going into, I don't know, we're just being pointed by security now.  Well, it's going to get out of here real quick.  Oh, no.  You know how this starts.  Oh, they're going into guests.  Oh, look at this.  It looks like a mob of them are going in the guest store.  Oh, they're going into guests?  I think.  It looks that way right now.  They're outside the door, but no, they've locked the door out. 
[01:52:30]  What?  I don't think they're letting them in.  Oh, no, they're not letting them in.  Oh, that's good, because we really won't have to start chanting A-Hole.  All right, hold on.  Rick is at the first store.  Thank you, Mark.  Let's go to Rick.  Rick?  Hey, guys, what's happening?  We are in our first store.  It's an extra lot.  We're in guests.  You're in guests?  We're in guests.  Okay.  Blue has grabbed himself a nice blue sweater.  Yeah.  You want to try that on?  Pop it on.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Pop the chair, bro.  I don't think he wants to try it on. 
[01:53:00]  He just wants to.  Dude, he gets his clothes out of dumpsters.  I don't think he cares about the fish.  Yeah, baby.  I've never heard shopping like this in my life.  It's a little tough to hear you guys right now, but he's just putting his hands on every  piece of clothing he can put his hands on.  Oh, God.  Between the spit flying out of his mouth and the crap on his hands. 
[01:53:30]  Well, is he going to make a purchase?  Hey, Blue, you want to get that sweater?  Yeah.  You want to get it?  All right.  Let's go buy you a sweater.  There we go.  There we go.  Stopping.  I feel like a whole bunch of shopping, God damn it.  Do you want some jeans, too?  Oh, he wants some jeans.  I think he's going to look dapper.  What kind of jeans you got?  What do you want to drive on?  I've got to make sure he's fitting you right.  No, no, no.  Don't take off your pants.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  What, Rick?  What's happening?  The car seems to take his pants off right here. 
[01:54:00]  No, no, no.  Don't take his pants off there.  No.  You took the fact that Rick has to yell, no, no, no.  Don't take your pants off in the store.  There are dressing rooms for that.  All right.  You want this?  I don't want to bring to you.  All right.  We have a sales associate.  He's all liquored up.  I can't hear you guys right now because he's freaking out over the selection of jeans. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, he likes a lot of jeans, huh?  That's great.  All right.  We'll let him look at the jeans.  Let's get in with Rich Voss.  Voss.  Hey, I got one of the guys buying a CD radio right now.  Yeah.  In the store here?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's arguing over price and stuff, so I like the guy.  There's no arguing over price at the mall?  He's with me.  We're talking him down.  On the streets of Bangladesh or something?  I know.  Give us a deal or we'll start bleeding. 
[01:55:00]  The mall, it's unbelievable, this place here.  Yeah, a lot of support.  You know, looking over the balconies and stuff.  This is great.  I'm going to be able to pick up a lot of hot girls with these two guys with me.  It's a freak show.  I know.  It is a freak show.  All right.  I'm going to go back in and help him purchase.  All right.  Well, we've had somebody buying clothes and now Voss is with someone buying stereo equipment.  Rick.  Rick.  I knew.  Uh-oh.  I hear cursing in the background. 
[01:55:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  I think it's great.  Rick.  Rick.  Are you there, Rick?  Rick.  Yes, Rick.  He's freaking out yet again.  He thought the sale for the homeless was bull and started freaking out.  But, no, you can buy this sweatshirt.  This is yours.  He started freaking out because he thought it was still...  Come on.  Let's go pay for it.  You want to go pay for it?  Come on.  Let's go pay for it.  Let's say you have to do anything for me.  Oh, we're trying to buy you some clothes. 
[01:56:00]  Look at the clothes.  You want those?  You want this?  He can't even understand someone trying to buy him something.  How sad is that?  I want to watch it.  All right.  We'll come this way.  We're going up to the cash register.  Oh, man.  Justice says Rich Voss and a homeless guy chewing down the price of a radio.  That's great.  Joe, what's up?  Joe, yeah.  I'm inside a guest right now.  They're going absolutely nuts. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  There's, like, security and NASA TV and everybody in here right now.  Is everybody having a good time, though?  Yeah.  Everybody has smiles on their face.  Except for security.  Security is kind of annoyed.  But, yeah.  They don't have to do anything during the day.  This is something extra.  I just would, like, hate to imagine, like, the people who came here to go Christmas shopping.  Well, you know something?  Homeless are people, too.  Right?  Right.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Joe.  All right.  We probably should take a break here, huh? 
[01:57:00]  We'll take a break and continue with the homeless shopping spree.  Rick, what's up?  Yeah, we are at the cash register, Blue.  This is a very nice sweater-jeans combo.  A sweater-jeans combo.  Yes.  Excuse me to her, all right, Blue?  That's $100.  No, no, no, Blue, Blue, Blue.  You've got to get more than cash.  What did he do, Rick?  We gave him $100, and he tried to put it in his pocket and walk away.  He's just stealing it. 
[01:57:30]  He's like, oh, I didn't know what it was going to cost me.  How much was his purchase, Rick?  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  How much was the purchase?  His purchase came out at $9.  About what?  About $9.  Probably?  Yeah, $9.  Blue, you've got some good stuff.  You've got some good gear, too.  Close to $100, I think.  Was it?  He's going to be looking good for about a week until somebody beats him and steals it.  Beats him up and steals it from him.  All right, Rick.  Thank you.  You got it.  We're going to take a quick break, all right? 
[01:58:00]  All right.  All right.  There goes Rick.  Let me just make sure Mark's not on the line.  Second, Mark.  Dude, we finally made it to a bar.  We're sitting here at a bar.  We broke away from the entire crowd.  Leave it to Mark.  He's going to get these guys drunk and get into trouble.  I know you, Mark.  It's their day.  They wanted to go right to the bar room.  So what are you going to do?  It's Christmas.  Mark, I've got to ask you something.  What was more horrific to look at?  The homeless or the ground zero cam you were manning during the disaster?  Definitely the homeless.  And the smell is worse, too. 
[01:58:30]  Hey, Mark.  Yeah.  What do you have at the bar?  Oh, I don't know.  Tommy, what are you drinking?  No, no, no, no, no.  No, what?  Not what do you have.  Who do you have?  Who do you have?  Tommy's drinking two shots at Absolute Straight Up.  Who do you have?  Tommy?  I got Tommy.  Blackroll Tommy.  Is it in there?  Andre.  I got Tommy and Andre.  Andre, what are you drinking tonight?  Hennessy.  He's doing Hennessy.  And we're doing a couple of them.  They got money.  They're at a bar.  These guys never get to sit at bars and drink Hennessy.  Some guys are buying clothing.  It's so weird to watch. 
[01:59:00]  Some guys figure they're getting the clothing.  Other guys are on the stereo equipment.  Right now, he's starting to shake real bad.  Tommy and Andre are spending their money on high-grade booze.  Why not?  It's America again.  It's Christmas.  I love it.  All right, don't get them too trashed until we're ready to leave.  They've got to be drunk to shop.  Come on.  This is fun.  All right, Mark.  Thanks.  See you, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Leave it to Mark.  Fantastic.  We should take a break.  All right.  Norton is just horrified.  I don't even think he wants to be a part of it. 
[01:59:30]  I know.  We haven't heard from him.  I don't know.  All right.  Yeah, you're listening to the Homeless Shopping Spree 2 on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Welcome back to the O.P. and Anthony program.  Homeless Shopping Spree 2 underway.  Happening as we speak.  So far, it's been very successful.  Yes.  And with that, let's get right back to the phones and talk to Ben. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, Ben, what's going on?  Guys, this is unbelievable.  I am right now being followed by hundreds of guys.  I'm with Ziggy and Tiffy Tom.  Ziggy is a celebrity.  The crowd champs for him.  He's taking photos with hot, like, 19-year-old chicks.  Oh, God.  Dude, it's insane.  So, Victoria's Secret, I want to say F you to the fat swat that wouldn't let us into Victoria's Secret and slam the gates down.  Why wouldn't they let you shut up?  I don't know.  I have no idea what the problem was.  But we went on and I went into a cologne store and sprayed the boys down. 
[02:00:30]  Now we're at Bloomingdale's.  And Bloomingdale's is meeting everyone with bags, which is very nice.  Oh, they've got, like, little bags for them?  Yeah, they've got bags for them.  Trinkle, trinkle.  The homeless need loving too, Anthony.  Look at that.  That's a crazy job.  That's a bad job.  That's a bad job.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Now let's go right to Rick.  He can't even hear us.  Rick, what's going on?  Rick.  Rick, you there?  Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.  I think we lost.  All right.  Let's go to... 
[02:01:00]  What's wrong with Norton?  Hold on.  Rick.  No?  All right.  Norton, what's going on?  You all right, Norton?  Yeah, we're looking for the group.  This promotions lady has no idea where we're going.  She's a little short person.  She's like, oh, I think they're over there.  We've got them jeans and Macy's.  We had to go to Macy's real quick and get them jeans because it was $100.  Armani closed the door.  Armani closed the door as probably as they should have.  Armani closed the door.  Have there been the chance of let them shop when these people stop the door? 
[02:01:30]  As we were walking into Macy's, it was...  All right, now, where are we going?  Okay, they're in Bloomingdale's.  All right, good.  All right, yeah, go ahead.  We're lost.  Head over to Bloomingdale's.  That's where the crowd is.  All right.  I'm going to check in with you in a second, man, and we've got to get back to Ben.  Port Norton's lost.  Hey, Ben, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Bloomingdale's just getting a bunch of the guys' stuff, and the people here are just great.  All the listeners, cigarettes, a huge hit.  Tippi Tom got someone for a nice fashionable pair of sunglasses. 
[02:02:00]  He's got his deodorant cologne that we bought him.  And we're navigating through the mall, too.  When I look up right now, I'm looking up, there's a second level on the mall.  It's actually looking down, some of which are completely horrified by us.  The majority is 18 to 34 men, as you can imagine.  I bet.  All right, hold on.  I've got to get to Voss.  Voss is freaking out.  Voss, what's up?  Hey, we're in, what's this, Bloomingdale's? 
[02:02:30]  I'm passing the hat around.  This guy sneaks.  Everybody's putting money.  Look at Voss.  He's getting more money.  It sounds like he's passing a hat around, and our listeners are handing him more money.  Everybody's putting money into the hat to get Snoop some...  And sperm's out of control.  I can't get him off my back.  Hey, Voss, isn't that the same deal you make with the club owners, that you pass the hat around at the end of the night?  Yeah, it's like for me, I'm trying to raise money for me. 
[02:03:00]  And the funny thing is, when we're shopping, I saw Norton...  You're breaking up.  You're breaking up.  I'm going to go to Psycho Mark.  The action is flying.  Everyone's shopping.  Psycho Mark, where are you?  We are still in the bar.  We've been going up close to $120 worth of booze so far.  Wait a minute, you've already had over $120.  Tommy is drinking faster than 10,000 whales in the ocean.  He is just putting it down like there's no tomorrow. 
[02:03:30]  And what's his poison?  Everything, anything and everything.  He's had Heineken, he's had vodka, he's having Chivas, he's wearing marinara.  Chivas and Gremlins, yay.  Who cares?  Dick Kennedy would be jealous of him.  Andre's sitting next to me, he's drinking the whole smear.  Have a great time.  Hey, Mark, how much would you say they have left out of their $100?  Who cares?  They're drunk.  What do they care?  It doesn't matter.  All right, Mark, thank you.  It's some feedback coming in.  And Stewie from Staten Island, the last time Voss wrote his material, Lindbergh was taken 
[02:04:00]  off from Roosevelt Field.  And UF and Tool from Queens, somewhere Lewis Black is laughing.  You know what's so sad is that the two guys that are with Psycho Mark sitting at a bar drinking  are missing out on the perks and the things that the listeners are buying for the other  guys.  Bloomingdale's was great.  They came out and gave bags of stuff to some of the homeless guys.  And Psycho Mark's two are getting nothing because they're sitting there getting tanked 
[02:04:30]  in a bar with Mark.  I knew Mark would do this, by the way.  It's okay.  Let's go, Rick.  I know it's okay, but the guys are missing out.  Hey, Rick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm here at EOS Cell Phones.  Yeah.  Um, believe it or not, Big Ed just got approved and bought a cell phone.  All right, wait a minute.  Ed, come back.  Wait a minute.  Big Ed just got approved? 
[02:05:00]  Big Ed somehow just got approved and he got himself a cell phone and the guy threw him  an extra 50 bucks off because he's on the show.  Look, I'm looking at a picture of Big Ed right now on the website.  There's no way he got approved.  You got approved, right, Big Ed?  Yes, I did.  Thank you.  Who co-signed for him?  Rockefeller.  See?  That's classic.  All right, Rick, hold on a second.  Let me go up to Pete.  He's on the second level of the mall looking down.  Pete, what's up?  Hey, Opie Anthony, what's up?  Hey.  This place is insane. 
[02:05:30]  There's hundreds of people here.  Cops all over the place.  Everybody just started chanting food courts.  They're right on the food court right now.  They're going to come up to the food court.  There are people here with looks on their face like they don't know what to expect.  People with strollers walking by.  It's hysterical, guys.  All right, cool.  Hysterical.  Thank you, Pete.  Thank you, man.  All right, bye.  Let's go to CJ.  He's at Houlihan's in the mall.  CJ.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Make it fast, CJ. 
[02:06:00]  Listen, I'm pulling into the parking lot.  It's murder fun parking.  I want to get all these guys together at Houlihan's.  I'll buy them all a shot.  Oh, hey.  Maybe right before they leave, because they've got to pass right by Houlihan's to get back  on the bus, perhaps they could all go in and do a little Christmas shot.  There you go.  All right.  Well, I'll be the ass with the leather jacket and the flashlight.  All right, CJ.  Thank you.  We'll look for you.  Let's go back to Ben.  Ben, what's up?  What's up, guys?  We were on our way to get our photos with Santa Claus, and they took Santa Claus out to  sign the whole deal where Santa was sitting. 
[02:06:30]  So there'll be no photos with Santa this year, unfortunately.  God damn it.  Oh, my God.  That made me really sad.  What's wrong with Santa?  We were able to do it last time.  I don't know.  I don't know, but let me tell you, it's just, it's totally nuts.  I have hundreds of people behind me right now.  I'm with Vicki and Tippi Tom, and we're about to hit Timberland.  Yeah, Timberland.  Yeah, which isn't these two guys' favorite store.  I don't know, some like our other homeless guys.  Guys, come on in.  Come on, guys. 
[02:07:00]  Let's get some footwear over there at Timberland.  Anthony, I guess Santa only takes pictures with the beautiful people.  Yeah, I guess Santa is a little too self-important to sit down with maybe Ziggy and get a nice  little Christmas picture with Ziggy.  Something he would put next to him on the curb on those cold winter nights, patterned with  the corners ripped and crinkling, but faded picture of Ziggy and Santa as he sings Silent  Night, as he looks at it and remembers a moment in his life where he was happy and accepted. 
[02:07:30]  But no.  By the way, Santa had to leave.  19-year-old chicks taking pictures with him.  Hey, I got to ask.  It's me.  You want a pair of these shoes?  All right.  They're trying on shoes, Anthony.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Don't they have to take their shoes off to try new ones on?  All right.  I'll go back to Ben in a sec.  They're getting ready to try on shoes.  Rick, what's up?  We are just making a pit stop for the guys because they have to take a leak.  Oh, you're going to the bathroom with them?  Yeah.  We're in here.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  There's Blue.  They're both taking a leak like regular people, so it's kind of cool.  Hey, Rick, does Blue have a peeler like yourself?  Oh, God.  Opie, I'm not going to get that close, believe it or not.  What a surprise, huh?  All right, Rick.  Rick, did they look at the urinals and go, what are these things?  Yeah, they almost turned around and, like, started to make themselves a new home in one  of the other stalls with the doors on them.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  Well, we'll go back home.  Rich Voss, you there? 
[02:08:30]  I think we lost Voss.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  We'll go to Ben and see how the trying of the shoes is going.  That's Kimberland.  Hey, Ben.  Ben.  Hey, guys.  You're right now.  I want to thank Kimberland for being one of the only stores to us and actually letting  us in.  And Ziggy's looking at shoes, but the shoes, he's not into buying stuff.  He keeps telling me that he doesn't see anything and he just wants a beer.  So I don't know.  Maybe he should have been with Mark.  Yeah, Phil hit the bar for a couple cocktails.  Ben.  Yes.  Have you heard what Mark is doing with his two? 
[02:09:00]  No.  What is Mark doing?  Mark immediately went with, who is he with, Rock and Roll Tommy and Andre and are sitting  in a bar.  They've already gone through $120 in booze.  That's hysterical.  What bar are they in?  Because we'll have right to the end.  We'll find him.  We can make $100.  We'll fly in there.  All right, Ben.  Thank you.  We're here.  We'll call you back in a bit.  All right.  There you go, Ben.  Poor Ziggy.  You know, Ziggy could use a coat and a booze, but he doesn't even know how to shop. 
[02:09:30]  I know.  Bill, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Did I hear Voss correctly?  Could he say you could get sperm off his back?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy, the homeless guy whose name is Sperm, I guess, is all over Voss.  I thought he was going to try and put himself in a washer or something.  All right.  Thank you, Bill.  Thank you.  But you're right.  Voss did say that and went over our heads.  Sheep lover saying, Rick won't look if the guy's taking a leak, but Mad Max loves the sea.  You bastards are funny. 
[02:10:00]  Chris, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just got to tell you, when I was walking in, first walked in, there was hardly anyone around,  and then all of a sudden I just saw a tidal wave of people.  Really?  I mean, a tidal wave.  See, what mall wouldn't want this?  That's a holy shock.  What mall wouldn't love something like this?  And some of these stores, some of these hypocritical stores, slamming their grates down on the homeless. 
[02:10:30]  Well, not on them, but in front of them, and not letting them shop.  Vicky wanted to try a cute little number from Victoria's Secret.  Yes, Vicky's shut the gate.  What they would have bought in there, I can only imagine.  Something that I'm sure within a matter of minutes would be extra crispy.  Look, panties.  Could you sync these up for me, miss?  All right, Rick's back on the line.  Hey, Rick, what's up?  Hey, we are in Brookstone right now, because Blue, he got himself a boombox. 
[02:11:00]  He's going to show him the section.  All right, hey, Rick.  Rick.  Yeah.  You've got to get outside the mall, outside the store a little bit, or at least near the entrance.  We're here to the matter.  All right, I'll try and get to a better location.  Oh, no, no, that's good.  That's good right there.  So what is he going to buy here?  He's looking at this type of boombox.  Oh, buy a boombox.  So it's an electronics place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Brooklyn.  Or a Brookstone.  Yeah.  All right.  And he's got snot going out of his nose, for Christ's sake. 
[02:11:30]  Ah, snot going out.  Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes.  All right, we'll check in with Rick in a second.  Where do they plug these things in?  Maybe batter.  Oh, we found the crowd, Anthony.  Joey.  Joey.  Yeah.  What's up?  They're coming out of Foot Locker now.  Mail security's blocking off everyone from hanging out with them. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, they won't let the people go in the store and shop.  No, now we're just, now we're most of the crowd.  But at the bar, it's like a regular Friday night out.  Oh, really?  Those guys look like they belong there.  Yeah, because they're probably...  I can't hear you guys.  All right, man.  We'll talk to you later.  Thank you.  Thanks for the help there.  I would think on a, what is it, a Tuesday, that there wouldn't be many people in the mall bar.  But now it's like a party in there.  Ah, Ben with Ziggy.  Ben.  What's up, guys?  I am on my way to Pat Coolhands with about 200 people and Ziggy. 
[02:12:30]  I have a huge crowd behind me, and we're headed towards Coolhands.  Ah, Ben.  So we're going to have a quick cocktail with Rock and Roll Tommy and Mark and that gang,  and then head back out to the stores.  We got the air.  Ben, what has Ziggy bought so far?  Dude, he got some socks, eodorant, some cologne, and then the whole bag of Bloomingdale stuff.  So, dude, I'm walking by people right now that are horrified in line for something here. 
[02:13:00]  They're just looking at me and Ziggy like we have ten heads.  People are booing, man.  Yeah.  You know, it's Victoria's Secret.  They've, once again, I don't know whose crew is over there, but Victoria's Secret is climbing down the gate.  And I'll let anyone in.  Let the homeless shop in.  That's Victoria's Secret once again.  All right, Ben. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you.  Call us back when you get to the bar, all right?  How much do you want to bet Ziggy drinks the cologne?  John, what's going on?  Hello.  Hey, John, what's up?  What's happening?  What's going on?  We're outside with Tippy Tom.  Where are you guys?  I don't know what entrance it is.  It's over near Modell.  Wait, you're outside the mall?  Yeah, we're outside the mall with Tippy Tom.  He's singing songs and smoking cigarettes.  Why isn't he still in the bar?  I don't know.  He wanted to sing. 
[02:14:00]  And where's Psycho Mark?  Hold on, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Billy Mack.  How are you?  How are you doing, Billy?  We're out here with Tippy Tom, and the guy was right.  He broke away from Ben and just threw him in the car.  What was that?  Tippy Tom had to have a cigarette, and they're throwing money at him like it was yesterday,  man.  Here.  Tippy Tom, sing a song for us, will you?  Sing a song for us.  Who wrote for that?  No, thank you.  Hey.  Okay.  All right.  I think you might have heard enough of that.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you, John.  All right. 
[02:14:30]  Take care.  Bye-bye, man.  Thank you.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho.  Hey, Marky.  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you?  All right.  What's going on?  Nothing.  We're all in three sheets to the wind.  Mark is tanked.  Listen to him.  No, we're all tuned up, and we're ready to go shopping.  This is how I do my girlfriend shopping.  Tommy over here is being a complete answer.  You'll finish your drink, you faggot.  Oh, I'm sorry.  There's tall people in here eating.  I apologize.  Oh, Grant.  I'm screaming in this nice restaurant. 
[02:15:00]  Now, are you in Houlihan's?  No, no.  We're in this nice food.  What's the name of this dump?  Oh, jeez.  The Toyo Cafe.  Ah.  Oh, ho, ho.  Oh, boy.  Because I think, I think.  You know where the Toyo Cafe is, right?  It's up the top of Christmas.  Mark, I think Ben and Ziggy are headed over to Houlihan's to get a drink.  Yeah.  Negative.  Negative.  Because Houlihan's is under renovations.  We already tried that. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, so they're going to have to go where you are.  Maybe we ought to get Ben on the line and tell him that.  All right.  Yeah, tell them that.  Well, they'll figure it out either one way or another.  But we're ham and we're going shopping.  All right.  There you go.  Thank you, Mark.  Goddamn, Mark's always a treat.  We're all tuned up.  I'm hearing there's a carousel at the end of the mall.  Oh, we should all get on the carousel.  Carousel.  And I think this would be a good place to take a break.  What do you think, huh?  What a dream day for these homeless guys. 
[02:16:00]  Scott, real fast if you have something.  Scott?  Yeah.  Real fast.  What's up?  What's going on, man?  Hey, O&A.  Hey.  This is the greatest show ever.  This is funnier than the retarded Laverne and Shirley yelling at stars.  Yeah, that's true.  I forgot about that show.  Yeah.  It's a lot of fun.  This is great.  It's translating great over the radio.  Great job, guys.  Oh, thanks, Scott.  All right.  Anyway, I was going to take a break, but Rick is checking in.  This is horrific.  Rick, yes.  Yeah.  Hey, guys. 
[02:16:30]  We are still in Brookstone.  The guys just got off the massage chairs.  Yeah.  And now Blue has decided he's going to sleep on their massage bed here.  He's not moving.  He's just laid down on one of the massage beds.  He's laid down and he ain't moving.  Goddamn homeless.  Oh, I think Voss has a crisis.  Hold on.  Thank you, Rick.  Bye.  There he goes, Rick.  Let's go to Voss.  Voss, what happened?  I lost sperm.  I swear to God, a mob took him somewhere and I lost my... 
[02:17:00]  They were in the footlocker.  Some lady just flat out bought him boots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The other guy's boots.  Yeah.  And then sperm...  I can't find sperm.  You can't find sperm.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Are you guys there?  Norton, what's up, man?  What's up, Norton?  Me?  Are we on the air?  Yeah.  Me and this loser are standing in the mall and we've lost a thousand people and ten bums.  We can't find our guns.  All right. 
[02:17:30]  There's a man pointing and there's two chicks and I want to bang both of them and one of  them bought homeless men.  Watch this and get this guy's boots.  And I got socks.  I got my homeless guy socks.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Oh, God.  It sucks.  All right.  Hold on.  Ladies, did you see ten bums with a thousand people following them?  How do you lose your bums in a mall?  All right.  We're going to Brookstone.  All right.  I'll call you guys back because I can't...  Oh, here's my guys.  All right.  All right.  Goodbye, fellas.  All right.  Okay.  Man, we better take a break. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  It's going quite well.  Did you see ten bums with a thousand people?  We lost the...  It is a big mall.  All right.  I am enjoying the hell out of this.  What a blast.  I can't even talk.  Rick, Tippi, Tom, and Blue are getting free food.  Free food.  There you go.  That's nice.  Oh, Jesus.  Rick.  Rick. 
[02:18:30]  Rick.  What's up?  Well, actually, it was funny.  We came on Tippi Tom's trip, and Blue and Tippi Tom had an emotional reunion.  It's the first time they've seen each other since we got to the mall.  An emotional reunion.  So there were screams, there was hugs, and now they're getting handed Wendy's hamburgers.  Oh, cool.  All right.  You know where they are?  Go get everybody right here.  Go get everybody right here.  Raise your hand.  All right, Rick.  Wait for being cool to them.  That's nice.  We're going to take a break, all right? 
[02:19:00]  All right, cool.  Thank you, Rick.  Bye.  All right.  It's a homeless shopping spree, too, on the O.P. and Anthony program.  What a great day.  We'll check in with the gang next.  The O.P. and Anthony homeless shopping spree is supported by a ski stop, Plainview, Long Island,  516-249-7980, and Riverhead, Fort Lincoln-Mercury, Route 58, Riverhead, New York, 631-727-2200.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  You're checking out the homeless shopping spree, too, on the O.P. and Anthony show for the holidays. 
[02:19:30]  It's so good to get the radio program back on track, Anthony.  Yes.  I'm just feeling that excitement.  It's been a tough few months for the O.P. and Anthony program.  Yeah, occasionally, sure.  But we're back on the right track, and it feels good, I'll tell you.  Oh, yeah.  Also, really fast, syndicated all over the country now, a bunch of radio stations, they  don't put us on live for whatever reason. 
[02:20:00]  They have their reasons.  Yeah.  I just want to announce that our new affiliate, New Orleans.  Yeah.  Streaming audio on the Internet.  Yep.  There you go.  Tell your friends.  Tell your friends.  They don't have to wait.  I've had a bunch of people say, you know, God, I moved out of state, I moved to a place  that we don't get the O.P. and Anthony show, what do I do?  And we tell them syndication underground.  Right.  But that's like trying to find the Holy Grail, you know?  Right.  One day it's there at some secret website, the next day you try to log on, it's gone. 
[02:20:30]  You've got to search around and find another feed that someone's illegally putting up,  but, you know, whatever gets the show out there.  You can check out the show live through the New Orleans Internet feed.  Go to opiananthony.com for that radio station, all right?  Yep.  Anthony, they're in the middle of the mall.  They're shopping.  Let's go to Ben.  Ben, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I'm Ziggy.  We're in F.A.O. Schwartz.  Right now, Ziggy's going to get a limited edition G.I. Joe doll and some Harry Potter stuff  at the moment. 
[02:21:00]  Harry Potter.  Oh, Ziggy's a Harry Potter fan.  Yeah, he's, you know, he's looking around.  He looks like one of the workers from the bank scene.  I didn't see it, but I'll tell you something out there's chuckling.  One of the other funny points of this whole thing,  as the downstairs of the mall is completely packed,  Mark screams out from the upper level,  Jack, Jack, Jack,  about as loud as you can imagine,  people just looking horrified.  Great.  What a way to spend the holidays, guys.  All right.  Ben, speaking of Psycho Mark,  we've got to check in with him 
[02:21:30]  because he finally has decided to shop with his homeless guys.  Yeah.  What?  When we're shopping with Tommy,  he's so drunk,  he can't even pass his two of all on that CD.  And then he goes for a CD of Karen Carter.  I'm like,  that's crazy.  You're a kid, Tyson.  Hold on.  You want to talk to Tommy while we're shopping?  And Tommy,  oh,  the boys want to...  Yeah.  Oh.  Rocky and Anthony.  Rock and roll.  What's up, man?  Rock and roll, Tommy.  Oh,  here we are with the Todd Rundgren section, man. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah,  you're at the Todd Rundgren section.  Todd Rundgren.  Okay.  Nothing,  nothing,  nothing,  and nothing.  Hey,  rock and roll.  Yes?  What did you have to drink over at the bar with Mark?  Oh,  three shots of Absolute  and a couple of Heineken's, man.  And what do you think of Mark?  Who's Mark?  I need to introduce myself formally to me, 
[02:22:30]  but Mark is a very respectable man.  You are a nut.  That's good enough.  Ira,  what's up?  Guys,  this is the greatest thing I have ever seen in my 26 years of life on this earth.  The looks on these people's faces are,  priceless.  They are horrified.  They are disgusted.  And,  that's you to all those stores that would not even let them shop. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah,  some of the stores,  sticks in the mud.  They pulled the grate down and didn't let them shop.  But the one thing you guys have to do next,  send them to the Islander game.  Not a bad idea.  I might have to call Ted over there at the Islander's office.  Eight dollars tickets.  All right,  man,  we've got to check in with a few more people.  Thanks,  Ira.  Let's go to Big Cab.  Big Cab,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  what's up?  Hey,  man.  I'm here with Butterall and Youngblood,  and one of the listeners,  Carl,  decided to take them to the shopper image. 
[02:23:30]  Oh,  wow.  Buy them anything they wanted,  under $50.  Oh,  that's pretty cool.  Yeah,  so,  Butterall has got a fifth full of batteries.  Okay.  For his radio.  Okay.  And a collapsible umbrella.  Nice.  All right.  And Youngblood is still,  he's searching among the electronic items.  I saw you,  Youngblood,  before he got on the bus.  Perhaps you ought to recommend that nose and ear hair trimmer.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you,  Big Cab.  Sorry about that.  I didn't mean to do that. 
[02:24:00]  We've got to check in with Norton.  Norton,  what's up?  We're in a Macy's,  and they're buying pants for one of all.  I don't know where my guys are.  Kevin has them,  and let him have them.  Norton's disgusted by this whole thing.  There's 500 potential rapists standing in a circle,  and there's a homeless man trying on clothes in the middle of the store.  He removed his trousers.  He did a strip tease.  I actually got a rod.  It was pretty nice.  And he's trying on pants.  And once you try them on,  I would suggest the store just letting him keep them. 
[02:24:30]  Regardless of the price.  That's where we are.  There's about 300 people down there.  We have 500 people just screaming and causing a ruckus.  And everybody in the store is extremely nervous.  I'm not with them.  Believe me,  if the cops come in,  so I'm just kind of standing back here.  Right.  See,  that's what he's doing.  My mule on chicks were standing in front of me.  So it's going well,  and the guys are moving his clothes in the middle of the store.  But I don't think anybody can see it  because everybody's surrounding this man in a circle.  So the last time I think a black guy was surrounded by this many white people,  he was on an auction walk dancing.  Oh, 
[02:25:00]  holy Jesus.  I know the struggle.  Oh,  my God.  Thank you.  I'll see you guys later.  Bye.  Let's check in with Rick.  Rick,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  we just left Sam Goody  with Big Ed and Big Blue,  and Big Blue was dancing,  singing,  thanking everyone in the store  because he just got himself a big boombox.  Oh,  yeah?  And he's just excited,  right?  Blue,  Blue,  you got the boombox.  How do you like that,  man?  Even to me.  Yeah,  I got the boombox.  Who it is?  I'm talking to.  O and A. 
[02:25:30]  Oh,  he ain't nothing.  I don't hear nothing.  He's deaf.  Why is he getting a boombox?  He can never hear us.  No,  he can't.  Hey,  Blue,  come back.  They all get nervous  when Blue starts running.  And also,  we got to thank a lot of the listeners  who helped chip in  because they didn't have enough money  to get them to the boombox  and they chipped in a bunch of cash.  Oh,  that's cool.  See that?  To make the season brighter  for Big Blue.  Cool.  Oh,  listen,  it's not quite the scum  everyone thinks they are.  All right.  Hey, 
[02:26:00]  Rick.  Yo.  We should wrap up pretty soon  because we got to end the show,  so.  All right,  you got it,  man.  We're just going to get Big Ed  some sneakers  and then we're out of here.  All right,  cool.  Thank you.  All right,  bye.  The homeless shopping spree,  too.  Coming to an end  in about 15 minutes here,  Anthony.  Ben,  what's up?  What's up,  guys?  We were just denied access  to our Marnie exchange  as they saw Ziggy walking up.  So we're heading towards  Sharper Image at the moment  where Ziggy might pick something up.  But we love when he tries on the suit.  I know.  I know.  Oh,  damn it.  Total dicks, 
[02:26:30]  man.  Total dicks.  What do you think Ziggy might want  at the Sharper Image?  A Razor Rollerboard scooter?  I don't know.  Ziggy hasn't really been in the shopping mood.  I mean,  he bought some essential stuff.  I think he could use the Ionic Breeze  air purifier  and just put it in his pants.  In his pants.  Purify that.  Sharper Image,  a big client of the O.P.  and Anthony show,  and the homeless guy  seemed to gravitate toward  the Sharper Image store.  There you go.  All right,  Ben,  thank you.  All right,  guys.  All right.  They're running out of energy, 
[02:27:00]  obviously.  Ryan,  what's going on?  Hey,  what's up,  man?  Hey.  Nothing funnier than watching Big Blue  in a massage chair in Brookstone.  It was absolutely,  totally...  Were the people in the store  just horrified  that he was smudging up  their equipment?  And he's looking at a radio  and there's an old lady  just shopping for the same radio  who had no idea  what was going on.  I'll take the one  the homeless guy wanted.  All right,  guys.  Take it easy.  All right,  man.  Thank you,  Ryan.  A lot of the listeners  that were there  had a great time. 
[02:27:30]  Anthony,  a few things.  You go to opianthony.com  and you can get  the face shots  of all the guys  that went shopping today.  And keep checking back  because I know  Steve C was there videotaping.  Everyone was taking pictures,  digital pictures,  so we'll have those up  as quick as we can  and you'll be able  to follow along.  We'll probably have  some video up  late tonight  on foundrymusic.com.  You can get there  through opianthony.com.  Guaranteed by showtime tomorrow  there's just going to be  a ton of stuff  on all the websites  from what you were hearing today.  Okay? 
[02:28:00]  Wow.  What a day.  I'm trying to...  I'm waiting.  Someone's calling in here.  I'm just waiting  to go to them.  Not a very successful  shopping spree.  All right,  we'll go to Seattle.  Jeremy,  what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Jeremy.  Good.  I'm calling from Seattle,  Washington, boys.  Seattle.  Yes.  I thought I'd drop a line  and tell you guys  that you guys are doing  a great job  and I don't get to hear you  until...  Well, you guys are later,  obviously,  but I'm kind of looking forward  to listening to this  homeless shopping spree today. 
[02:28:30]  It sounds pretty fun so far.  I've got to tell you,  it's been great,  so you have to turn in.  You're going to enjoy it  later on tonight in Seattle.  Well, me and my wife  love you guys  and keep up the good work.  All right, fellas?  All right,  thank you, Jeremy.  And I've got a message  for Norton, too.  Yeah.  Even though he's not there.  What's that?  Shots.  All right,  thank you.  All right,  later, fellas.  Bye.  Much from Allentown's  got to add a little taste  of reality to this whole thing.  You know that boombox  is going to be stolen  within five minutes  of him hitting the street.  Isn't that awful? 
[02:29:00]  Ah, Jack,  what's going on?  There's more out there.  Jack,  good evening.  Hey.  Hey,  great,  unfunny show.  I tell you,  you guys are the most  unfunniest people  I've ever heard.  I mean,  I try to, like,  listen to the morning programs,  which are much better  than your afternoon program,  but I tell you,  you just ate the cake.  It's just so unfunny.  Hey, Jack,  Jack,  it's so smart of you  to call up on  one of our best shows ever  and try to pull that bias.  Yeah,  it's unfunny.  I mean,  you guys are just great  at being unfunny.  If you've got to be great  at something,  you can't be great  at being unfunny.  Yeah, 
[02:29:30]  keep listening,  then,  every day,  just like you do.  All right,  dude,  I compare you to the morning shows  that I like listening to.  Oh,  God only knows  what morning show he likes.  Oh,  he probably thinks snorting.  Right,  exactly.  Exactly.  With his drivel.  Wonderful.  A little tip  to the people that hate us.  Yeah.  Like,  take a day  when we really suck.  Yeah,  there's plenty of those.  There are plenty of those days.  Then you call in  and tell us how unfunny we are  and then it'll get to us.  But a day like this,  you're wasting your dime.  It's a great fun show today.  Absolutely.  Freaking loser. 
[02:30:00]  Trying to rain on our parade,  Opie.  Not today.  Yeah.  This was obviously  a very unfunny show.  Steve,  what's up?  Hey,  man,  what's up?  Hey.  We just walked out of foot action  with Dippy Tom.  I'm with Matty.  And,  uh,  got to give a big  sipping to foot action.  They hooked him up  with some really,  really nice boots.  Dippy Tom is littered  with bags  of socks  and clothes.  Styling.  Yeah,  he's really styling now.  Well,  slow down.  Styling.  And he's dancing  and randomly breaking  into Christmas carols, 
[02:30:30]  too.  We have no idea  where Ben is.  We were with Ben  for a little bit  and Ben,  I think he freaked out  with Ziggy  and went somewhere else.  Well,  Ziggy was a star,  so it's kind of  a little more pressure  on Ben.  I think so.  I think so.  It seems like you...  You want to say something?  Yes.  Here you go.  Who am I talking to?  That's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  I'm here.  I wanted to meet you  the other day.  Well,  you were in here  for quite some time,  Tippi.  You met us.  There's no idea  he met us yesterday. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, God,  he's hammered.  You weren't there  when I was there.  Right,  we weren't there.  Exactly.  It was on our show,  but we weren't there.  We did the whole show  with us yesterday.  The guy from KISS  was there, though.  The guy from who?  The band KISS.  KISS.  He remembers Gene...  He remembers Gene  being in the studio,  but not Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Tom,  did you get some good stuff?  Yeah.  Well,  happy holidays there, Tom.  I feel like a celebrity. 
[02:31:30]  Well,  you are a celebrity today,  my friend.  Oh, stop it.  All right, man.  You're going to let you go.  I can't hear everybody  well,  because it's too noisy here.  Wow, man.  All right.  All right,  we're going to check in  with Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark,  what's up?  Tom is yelling  at everybody  in the CD store.  He's yelling so much  his teeth popped  on the floor.  He's yelling  and screaming.  I'm like,  come on,  hurry up, 
[02:32:00]  let's go.  Yeah,  that's not funny.  We got Andre's  shoes.  We got him  some new tibolent.  Oh,  you did?  Yeah,  he got some fresh  tibolent,  so he can go back  to 14th  and kick some ass.  And Andre's  almost about done.  He almost whipped  his junk out  and rubbed it  against the 70s  rock collection  over here.  Thank God  that didn't happen.  Oh, God,  thank you.  I'll see that again.  I think they're  going to start  leading the house.  Yeah,  I think we're  going to get them  out of the mall now.  Mark is trash.  Hammer,  you can tell.  Mark is trash. 
[02:32:30]  Kevin,  what's up?  Hey,  guys.  Hey.  Oh,  hey,  to answer that guy  earlier,  it's not that you guys  aren't funny,  it's just that you're  unbelievably unoriginal.  Oh,  okay.  Of course,  this has never been  done before.  Who's done,  who did the homeless  shopping spree?  Oh,  Jesus,  guys,  stop fooling  yourself.  Oh,  for Christ's sake.  Thank you,  Kevin.  Oh,  you know something?  You're right,  I will.  Yeah.  I'm going to stop  fooling myself.  You know how ridiculous  this sounds,  especially today with  someone taking  what's in my pants  and doing it today?  Yeah,  exactly.  Don't worry about it. 
[02:33:00]  Then don't listen.  I never understand  the people that call up.  They're so funny.  why call up?  Just stop listening.  I will tell you,  the show sounds so good  that they're pissed off.  Yeah,  I think that.  Yeah.  It pisses them off.  You mean someone else  out there could actually  do good radio?  Yeah,  douche.  Ben,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  what's going on?  I brought Ziggy  into a very nice men's room  where he's gone into a stall  and I think he's going to be  in there for a while.  He came in 
[02:33:30]  and it was like  a kid going F.A.L.  Schwartz for the first time.  He was so excited.  That's great.  It's like paradise.  Like when Dorothy  opened the door  of the house  and walked out  into a land of color  in Oz,  right?  Yes,  totally.  All right,  Ben,  you should wrap everyone,  well,  round everyone up  and get them out of there  because we've got to  close the show,  man.  Yeah,  we're right at the exit.  We're just,  Ziggy wanted to take a dump  and I figured  why not do it in style  and then we'll get  out of the bus.  All right,  cool.  Thanks,  Ben.  All right.  Okay.  Anthony,  with that,  why don't we take a break  and we'll wrap up 
[02:34:00]  and we'll wrap up  Homeless Shopping Spree 2  next.  All right.  O.B.  Anthony.  W.A.W.  And we're back  with the O.B.  and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Homeless Shopping Spree 2.  Huge success.  Oh,  my God.  At the Roosevelt's  Field Ball.  It had everything,  didn't it?  A little bit of drama,  a little danger  there when they were  pulling in. 
[02:34:30]  We weren't sure.  Rick sounded like  the Rick from the Voyeur Bus  for a little while there.  And,  uh,  then they got off the bus  and to the mall  there.  Just hundreds of people  cheering them on.  And,  uh,  they bought stuff  and people bought  stuff for them.  And the ones with  Psycho Mark drank  until they,  until they fell down  and spit their teeth  out in the CD store.  What a great day.  I want to thank  the mall for,  uh,  not being tools. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah,  the mall itself was great.  There were a couple  of stores that were  a little,  uh,  a bit tool-ish.  Psycho Mark,  what's going on?  Oh,  he's not down.  Oh,  crap.  There we go.  Uh,  Psycho Mark.  Hey,  let's go to Rick.  Hey,  Rick,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  we are out front  where we started  in front of Hoolahan.  Um,  and it's just been  an emotional time  as,  as Big Blue  and Tiffy Tom 
[02:35:30]  have been making  speeches to the crowd  to let them know  how they appreciate  everything they've done  for them today.  Oh,  great.  Oh,  they broke  this a little.  every time he's at home  and if you ever  saw him  you would even  say he'd close  all of the other  rangers  used to have to  call him  Maine  they never let  court rule  on 
[02:36:00]  for the ranger  game  in that  thing.  Oh,  I love it.  Let me forget  for words.  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah.  So,  Rick,  hello.  They're getting  back on the bus.  The bus,  the bus is about  to arrive,  so everybody  is out here.  Fans of  O&A,  we've got  upstairs  cheering 
[02:36:30]  throwing down  an incredible  quiet holiday  package.  Let's hear it  for the homeless.  Let's hear it  for the homeless.  They cheer  as long  as it's not  them who's homeless.  Right.  F-Tard Mike  said he learned  that who lands  is under construction.  After all that,  that's what he learned.  That's what he learned.  Sure.  Steve,  what's up?  It's Carcord. 
[02:37:00]  I'm here with Steve.  Hang on a second.  All right.  Hey,  what's up?  What's up,  Steve?  Well,  it is officially  a mob scene.  We were sitting  out here with  Dippy Tom,  Blue,  Ed,  and about  a thousand people  easily  outside of  Hoolahead,  which I am told  has been shut down.  And these guys  are singing  Christmas carols.  It's really amazing.  Very cool.  Very cool.  And I'd like  to say thank you  to the really  self-righteous  security guard  who not only  stopped us  from videotaping, 
[02:37:30]  easily a dozen  times,  but told us  that all the  help that we  were doing today  was completely  useless because  it was only  one day  and not every  day.  So that's  freaking  kiss my ass.  All right,  Steve.  Hey,  Steve,  did you get  some tape  anyway?  Oh,  there's just  tape everywhere.  I had my  little hidden  camera.  Jeff and I  got amazing  videotape.  Thanks to a  couple hidden  cameras.  Very cool.  All right.  And that footage  will be up on  Sound Dream Music  back.  Absolutely.  Oh my God.  Thank you,  Steve.  One of the  homeless guys  very nervous  about the 
[02:38:00]  hidden cameras  and he started  freaking out.  Oh no,  I was  stealing  stuff.  Tom from  Buffalo writes,  I learned that  asking a woman,  excuse me,  miss,  have you seen  ten bums and  a thousand  people will  not get you  laid ever.  Ever.  Ah,  Psycho Mark.  We're just  calling the  Mexican Hall  and we're  making our  way right.  And we're  paying the  ass to  you to  start to  shopping.  I don't  know if  it's the  phone or  his drinking,  Opie.  I couldn't  understand a  word Mark  said.  A little  of both, 
[02:38:30]  I believe.  Rick?  All right,  we lost  Rick.  Okay.  Well,  they're  obviously making  their way out  of the  mall,  Anthony.  Yeah.  Back on  the bus  for the  trip back  to New  York City.  And,  well,  tomorrow,  we'll have  all the  stories from  the trip  back to  New York.  I'm sure  it's going  to get  really  interesting.  And some  audio from  the bus  trip back,  too,  because I  think they  got a  couple of  debt.  Yeah.  Rick,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  I got a  quick one  that I  learned.  Okay.  That even  the smell  of homeless  people's feet  nearly gets  me to puke  right in  the store. 
[02:39:00]  That's  got to be  disgusting,  man.  I gagged  four times  while Ed  was trying  on a pair  of sneakers.  Oh,  man.  And it  didn't even  look like  he had  socks on.  Yeah.  Hey,  Rick,  what's going  on out  there?  Looks  like Snoop  is coming  out of  the mall.  Some  other of  the homeless  people that  are joining  us as we  wait for  the bus.  Okay.  The bus  should be  here,  like they  said any  minute.  So we're  just wading  back into  the group  here.  Yeah,  it seems  like more  of the  homeless  guys are  coming  out  including  thinking. 
[02:39:30]  Hey,  Rick,  you're going  to get  some audio  on the  bus,  too?  Yeah,  we'll run  some audio  on the  bus,  some video  and pictures  and everything.  All right,  good deal,  man.  All right,  we'll see you  guys later.  All right,  call back  when the bus  arrives.  I'll call  you when  the bus  arrives.  All right,  good.  This is a  huge crowd  out there,  man.  Hey,  Frank,  what's going  on?  Hey,  what's up,  guys?  Hey,  laughed my ass  off just  like last  time.  That was  fun.  Hey,  who was  chaperoning  who?  Psycho Mark  or Rock  and Roll  Tommy?  That's a  great question.  I know,  you know  something?  Both of  them became  complete 
[02:40:00]  equals.  I don't  know,  man.  I'm  surprised  they didn't  arrest  Mark.  All right,  thank you,  Frank.  All right,  later.  Let's go  to Anthony.  Anthony,  what do you  have for  the show  today?  What's  up,  guys?  Hey,  man.  I think  you guys  just effing  rule,  man.  You guys  are just  great.  Hope,  I think  you're  a genius.  Yeah,  whatever.  And whatever,  you just  don't know  what they're  talking about.  Well,  it sounds  like you're  pissed off.  It pisses  us off,  too,  because we  work pretty  hard on  this damn  radio.  Yeah,  I mean,  you guys,  I mean,  that guy 
[02:40:30]  has a lot  of nerve,  man,  getting on  the air  saying that  he invented  a lot of  stuff.  Oh,  he's a  douchebag.  He's getting  on,  he's all  pissed off  because he  was laughing  and he's  so brainwashed  that he  he feels  he shouldn't  laugh at  anything else  on the radio  because somebody's  been telling him  for years  that there's  nothing else  that could be  on the radio  that could be  entertaining.  Exactly.  I mean,  I've used to  listen to that  guy for a  long time,  but I haven't  listened to him  now in months.  I mean,  that's just  pathetic.  Well,  whatever,  you know,  thank you. 
[02:41:00]  You guys are  the best,  man.  Well,  I'm sure  they're dumping  out.  As they dump  out,  which is just  fantastic.  Incredible.  You guys rule,  man.  You guys are  the greatest.  Hell,  man.  They didn't  rain on our  parade today.  We had a  great time.  You guys are  great,  man.  That was  one of the  best shows  I've ever  heard in my  life.  Thank you,  Anthony.  That was  great.  I believe  tomorrow we  bring back  Guess What's  In My Pants  live on this  show.  The full  version.  Might as  well.  From the  originals.  All right.  Thank you,  Anthony.  Take care,  guys.  Yeah.  Everybody  doesn't take 
[02:41:30]  from anyone.  Sure.  Okay.  Rick,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  the bus has  just pulled  up.  getting on  the bus  as we get  set for  departure.  The mall  here.  Let's go,  guys.  Here goes  Butt and  Roll.  Ah,  look at  them all  like getting  on the  bus.  We're on  there.  Let's get  all the  homeless  guys in  here.  Come on,  let's not  forget  anybody. 
[02:42:00]  And the  security is  just incredibly  tight as we  try and get  everybody out  here.  Of course.  I give  props to  the security.  Everyone was  pretty much  everyone was  cool at the  mall today.  And we  want to  thank you,  man.  There's  like a  mark.  Yeah,  I know.  All right,  here he  comes,  the star  of the  show today,  Big Blue.  Big Blue,  he fell.  Somebody  grabbed him  though before  he hit the  concrete. 
[02:42:30]  Here he  comes,  Big Blue  and Anna  as they  make their  way.  With  their  booty of  good  moping,  making  their  way  out of  the  bar.  Oh,  he's falling  backwards.  All right,  there he  goes.  He's falling  backwards.  His  blue,  his  sippy  tom,  his  bomb,  his  bomb,  new  composing  for pictures.  They're  taking  pictures  with  the  homers.  These  guys are  rock stars 
[02:43:00]  for a  day,  man.  There  has to  be at  least 2,000  people  toning  around  this  area.  Yeah.  All right,  it's  only  Bob.  And here  comes  rock and roll  Tommy.  Rock and roll  Tommy loves  the F word,  man.  All right,  guys,  we are out of  here.  You're all on the  bus?  Everyone on?  I don't know.  Hold on.  I hope they got 
[02:43:30]  ziggy.  I didn't hear  ziggy.  Hold on.  I'm getting  reports,  psycho marks  on top of  the bus.  Psycho Mark?  Yeah,  I'm on top of  the bus right  now.  I jumped out  the emergency  hatch,  and I'm just  looking down  at everybody.  He's hammered.  I love it.  Oh,  I'm sorry.  Hey,  everybody!  Everybody was  trying to get  some free joints  for the ride home.  Hey,  everybody,  you got some  splints for the  ride,  back?  You got to get  everyone arrested,  man.  Leave it to 
[02:44:00]  mark, man.  Hey,  Rick,  what's up?  We're back  to you,  Rick,  what's up?  I can't hear you.  What did you say?  We're back to you.  All right,  we're just doing  a final hit count,  making sure  everybody's on  the bus.  Okay.  We lost three.  We lost three.  We lost three.  Yeah,  great.  Three.  All right,  so we lost three.  That's not bad.  Who's missing?  It's not bad.  We can lose three.  Hell,  you guys are  in Hempstead.  No one's  going to notice.  Oh.  All right, 
[02:44:30]  we're going to try  and track down  our missing three.  Hey,  where's Norton?  Norton is already  on the bus.  Right here.  Right here.  Oh,  there he is.  Let me talk to Norton  while you...  What's going on?  You want to talk to Norton?  Yeah,  real fast.  Norton,  I'm not scared,  but you got it.  Hey,  guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy...  I can't hear  anything.  Hold on.  I can't hear you. 
[02:45:00]  I don't know  if you can hear me.  This was really great,  man,  and you had a lot  of people show off.  It was really a fat house.  Hold on.  With that,  I can't hear anything.  I can't hear anything.  Norton.  Well,  it's a sloppy mess  at the end,  but that's okay,  Ed.  That's okay.  Well,  you know,  a lot with all the people,  it's hard to hear.  What a day,  though,  man.  I can't wait to see  some of the video  and the snapshots  being taken,  and we're going to have  some audio  from the bus ride. 
[02:45:30]  Yes.  Back to New York,  so,  I mean,  this doesn't end here.  Who are the three  that are missing?  I think Ziggy.  I didn't hear Ziggy  get on the bus.  Who else?  I would say  Tippi Tom.  No,  Bert was very paranoid.  He might have ran.  Yeah,  he might have bolted.  Ron,  what's up?  Hey,  guys,  what's up?  I'll tell you,  this is one of the most  hilarious second editions  of the Home and Shopping Tree  ever,  and I'll tell you right now.  What a great sequel.  Oh,  yeah,  I'm saving it.  I wanted to go to do it again  Christmas Day anyway.  You know,  we didn't want to do  Home and Shopping Tree again 
[02:46:00]  because we didn't think  we could top ourselves,  but I must say,  man,  a lot of people worked  really hard behind the scenes,  and this was a home run today.  Yeah,  Keith did a great job.  Home run.  You guys did great,  but I'm going to tell you  one thing.  This is more funnier  than last year's  first Home and Shopping Tree  that Rick says,  is that a train?  Oh,  yeah,  remember that?  Yeah,  we're going to break  that out today.  This is going to be  a classic right there.  All right,  Ron,  thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Yeah,  we're going to replay this.  You guys know that already.  Probably like Christmas Eve  or something.  Yeah,  it's very Christmas-y.  All right,  I just want to talk to Rick 
[02:46:30]  before we get off the air.  We only have like  two minutes left.  Yeah,  it would be nice  if Rick would call  or someone calls him  and we could  just get him on  one more time  as the bus pulls away.  Make sure they have everybody.  I guarantee you  we're going to have  some stories to tell tomorrow.  Ah,  yeah.  Who's this now?  All right,  they're calling in.  Popping on.  We'll get him on  and then we'll get off the air  and make way for Ron and Fez  next here in New York.  Put him down.  I know it's somebody.  Yeah,  we don't care who they are 
[02:47:00]  or what they've got to say.  Just pop it down.  Pop it down.  That's probably Earl calling out  on line 12.  All right,  I guess we...  Yeah,  well,  now we're not going to be able to...  We're going to have to end the show  without hearing from the gang.  I want to hear who was missing.  I want to give props  to Rick  and Ben  and Stinky.  Keith the cop.  This wouldn't have been possible  without Keith.  Ethel and our whole  promotions department.  John Rossi.  I mean,  a lot of guys  worked really hard on this 
[02:47:30]  for the last few weeks.  Even though we don't show prep it.  We don't.  Of course not.  We just sit here and...  Norton is still in baby gap.  Is that what they're saying?  It's instant feedback.  All right.  Oh, well.  I know the second we...  That's how we're going to end?  This is how we're going to end?  Well, the second we go away,  I know that's going to light up  and it's going to be Rick, so...  This is how we end?  Yeah.  I want to hear the boss pulling away.  I know.  No problem. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Rich who?  Boss?  No.  No.  All right.  Well, this is how  Homeless Shopping Spree 2 ends.  Thank you to everybody  that showed up down there,  did a great job,  and some people actually  pulled out some money  out of their wallets  and bought these guys' stuff.  Oh, you guys rock.  You guys rock.  I wouldn't have done that.  And by the way,  thanks for hanging with us.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We've had a tough  three or four months,  but thanks for hanging with us.  Well, I get thinking we got it.  I know, but just put them on hold.  All right.  Yeah, you don't have to write, Ben. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, put them on hold.  Oh, my God.  Put them on hold.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Rick, Rick, Rick.  That's Psycho Mark drunk.  Ben, Ben.  Ben.  All right.  We got to go.  That son of a bitch.  We'll let you know  what happens tomorrow at 3. </pre>
