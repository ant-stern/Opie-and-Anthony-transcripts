<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and vulgar humor, referring to themselves and their crew (Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, and E-Rock) with insulting nicknames.  A central theme is "Whip'em Out Wednesday," a listener segment encouraging listeners to display "WOW" stickers on their vehicles. Mr. H. (a Tim Sabean voice-alike) provides a lengthy, rambling explanation of the segment, framing the stickers as a way to attract women.  The distribution of stickers in various cities is discussed.  Opie's birthday is also a major focus, detailing his sugar-fueled celebrations, resulting digestive issues, and a concerning helicopter ride over Manhattan.  The show covers Brad Pitt's photos with children in Africa, sparking discussion about his perceived change in lifestyle; the dangers of not wearing seatbelts (including a caller, Glenn from Philly, sharing his childhood experiences); the ineffectiveness of Hillary Clinton's proposed speed limit reduction to combat the gas crisis; and the hosts' dislike of certain cell phones (Razor) and preference for the Pebble.  A "Stalker Patty" audio clip is teased, and "Whip'em Out Wednesday" is further promoted.

The broadcast continues with mockery of Bruce Springsteen's Asbury Park songs, using racially charged language.  A call from Jay in Virginia Beach, boasting about his fuel-efficient driving, provokes ridicule and insults from the hosts.  The conversation pivots to Billy Joel's alleged drunk driving, returning to gas prices and fuel efficiency with more aggressive and offensive comments about drivers.  Matt, a caller, criticizes Jay's driving.  The discussion then shifts to a song's lyrics ("Cigars and Scotch"), leading to a crude rhyme from Opie. Opie recounts his birthday gifts, including baseball tickets, and a humorous high school anecdote. The conversation turns to Stalker Patty, who visited the studio with a birthday gift for Opie. An audio clip plays of the hosts shaving her head while singing "Happy Birthday," capturing her distress and pleas.  Studio guest Patrice O'Neal shares stories about tipping and his childhood.  The conversation touches on past experiences and an upcoming celebrity softball game.  Further calls continue to criticize Jay's driving habits with violent comparisons.  The segment ends with a "news teases" game, playing vague and unsettling local news promos, prompting speculation and jokes. A police officer calls, noting that some of their actions could be considered criminal.

A segment focuses on "scary news teases" from listener Danny, covering topics like cats sleeping on babies, car blind spots, grapefruit juice interactions with medication, cold-water washed underwear (leading to an inappropriate discussion about anal hygiene), and cleaning products resembling energy drinks.  The hosts and Patrice O'Neal engage in humorous and offensive jokes, making light of death and social issues. A "walk" outside the studio features crude remarks to pedestrians.  The segment concludes with a discussion of a teacher's sexual relationship with a student, focusing on the teacher's appearance and using offensive language. A "dump report" details censored comments from the first half of the show.

The show continues with an anecdote about drawing swastikas on sneakers, leading into a highly offensive and anti-Semitic rant about Fonzie from "Happy Days."  The conversation shifts to graphic and violent scenes from *House*, with comedic commentary from caller Pat from Wienarkey.  The discussion moves to best and worst movie sequels, with Pat contributing anti-Semitic jokes related to *Jaws*. Callers offer opinions, interspersed with offensive jokes, including homophobic and racial slurs.  The birthdays of Doug, Kel Bell, and Bob Dylan are mentioned. The segment ends abruptly with a continued list of worst movie sequels and offensive commentary.

A segment focuses on worst movie sequels, particularly *Jaws* and *Friday the 13th*, with graphic and comedic descriptions of plots and scenes.  Racial slurs and misogynistic language are frequent.  Listener Patrice O'Neill is credited with prompting the discussion.  Callers offer opinions, leading to further tangents.  A heated exchange ensues with angry listener Pat Henkel, who criticizes the show's move to CBS radio and perceived shorter XM broadcasts, leading to highly offensive language from the hosts.  Dickie Boy, another listener, receives similar insults.  A pre-recorded interview with race car driver Brian Hurta about the Indy 500 is played, interspersed with racial stereotypes and offensive language.  Studio producer Derek is briefly mentioned.  The segment concludes with continued banter and offensive language.

The final segment features a countdown of the worst movie sequels, including *Blues Brothers 2000*, *Cheaper by the Dozen 2*, and *Roots* sequels, focusing heavily on *Leprechaun* with graphic descriptions.  Highly offensive racial slurs are used repeatedly.  The discussion turns to *American Idol*, expressing disdain for Taylor Hicks and Ace Young using homophobic slurs.  A past encounter with Ace Young and the producers' fear of having them as guests are discussed.  A running joke focuses on Eric's sweating, leading to absurd and offensive jokes about the contents of his armpits, using racial slurs and graphic imagery.  The segment ends with a final offensive "tender sentiment" from Eric and further insults.  The retrieval of a lost book containing old bits is mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Watch the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show. 
[00:00:30]  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jesus.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's here like Chuck.  No!  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Well, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[00:01:00]  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes some funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  Sorry.  It's true, though.  Nightmare.  But enough of this palaver.  Yes.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's go on the road.  Let's do it!  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday. 
[00:01:30]  That's what we call it.  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Is it?  Is it really?  That bit's starting to take off.  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  I've done that at home where you see something on TV and just answer the TV.  Oh, do ya?  I love the Jimmy bit.  You should plan for your children's future.  Should I? 
[00:02:00]  That's my new favorite bit.  I love it.  You're listening to a radio show that comes up with more bits than any other radio show in America.  And the latest one is Jim Norton's Did Ya?  Do Ya, Did Ya, Will Ya, Could Ya, Would Ya.  I love it.  Every single one of them.  And it's something you can play at home.  Because it works great with the wife or girlfriend.  I had such a rough day today.  Did ya?  End of conversation.  And he punched me. 
[00:02:30]  Did he?  Did he?  You think?  He said I was lippy.  Were ya?  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  What's that call going to cost ya?  Nothing.  Is it a free phone call?  It's free.  See, I'm not up on the 866.  I know 800 numbers are free.  800 is a thing of the past.  888, is that free?  That's free. 
[00:03:00]  866-FREE?  Free.  Nice.  Yeah, make more free numbers.  Just giving them away.  Let's go to Mr. H.  He wants to explain.  Whip him out Wednesday for the fine new listeners.  Oh, good morning.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  All right, sir.  Let's turn you up a little bit before you start chatting with us.  All right, Mr. H., go.  Good morning, Bobby.  Good morning, Anthony.  Angel Eyes.  Hello, Angel Eyes.  I like it.  This will be a review for the pests.  And for the newbies, please reach for the volume knob and turn it up a little bit. 
[00:03:30]  And pay attention!  In order to participate in Whip Him Out Wednesday, the finest radio promotion ever devised by mankind, and Opie's brain, that is,  you must first obtain a wow sticker, that is, if you wish to be fancy, if you wish to be low budget, you can always go for a dirty vehicle and scrawl the word wow in the back of the vehicle, in the dirt, anywhere you wish. 
[00:04:00]  This works especially well for semi-trailers, my personal favorite.  If you wish to be fancy and celebrate wow, you may go writing a self-addressed stamped envelope.  People are hating this guy.  By the way.  I know.  111, 57th Street.  Long-winded.  New York, 10019.  I'm trying to be funny and not.  It's beautiful.  I want you to talk over me. 
[00:04:30]  Then I get a little reprimand from you.  You could also Google wow stickers on the internet and find the other website I'm probably not at liberty to mention at the present moment.  Yeah, we're still not allowed to mention websites over here for some reason.  But I think we're figuring that out.  Just join our MySpace account.  Basically, yes, it's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Wow stands for whipping them out.  The ladies will do that if they see the wows on the cars and the trucks out there, whether it's a homemade wow sign, whether it's written in the dirt on the back of a truck, or if you have fun, one of those fine wow bumper stickers. 
[00:05:00]  And it's like fishing.  It's like fishing.  Shut up.  Shut up.  We're done with you, Mr. H.  Your wow sticker is like a worm on a hook.  You just put it out there.  You don't jump in and harass the fish.  You don't grab the fish and jam it on the hook.  You just leave it in the water and drive around.  That's what it's like.  And then before you know it, you'll forget you even have it on the back.  And you'll look over and go, hey, why is she doing that? 
[00:05:30]  That's fantastic.  And then you'll realize, oh, yeah, it's because I had a wow on the back of my car.  That's how it works.  This long-winded explanation we're getting.  Isn't that what living is all about?  No.  Punching out gentlemen.  Have a wonderful day.  Thank you for that fine explanation.  Thank you, Tim Sabian, by the way.  Anyone else notice that sounded a lot like Tim Sabian?  Same delivery.  Same delivery.  Everything.  Ben, what's going on with the wow sticker?  Wow.  Philly has their Yankees. 
[00:06:00]  I beat their socks last night.  I got confidence tonight Randy's pitching.  Do the Yankees and Red Sox play like every other day?  How many times have they played this year so far?  I know they love matching them up.  Third series.  Third series already?  Yeah, but one game got canceled, too.  There was a rain out one day, so they've got to make a living up.  But they've only played, what, like 25 games so far?  They're chilling.  So who has their wow stickers?  Philadelphia gets their wow stickers today, and the rest are still coming.  Nice.  And New York has theirs.  How about Pittsburgh? 
[00:06:30]  Let's say hi to Pittsburgh.  We said hi to Pittsburgh.  Oh, who did we say hi to?  Sorry, hi to Pittsburgh.  Oh, no, we said hi to Dallas yesterday.  Right, Dallas yesterday.  I wanted to say hi to Pittsburgh, and Opie said, no, screw them.  He has Pittsburgh-ophobia.  And a tease, right?  That's the fear of mullets.  I'm pointing out the details we have that we can announce Jimmy Day today, too.  Oh, we're going to announce Jimmy Day today, all the details for Jimmy Day.  We've been teasing it.  For me?  All for you.  I'm going to have a surprise look on my face all day, like a burn victim.  Just no eyelashes.  Big, wide eyes. 
[00:07:00]  Mouth agape.  Yeah, lipless.  Stupid hat slash wig on.  Oh.  Anyway.  Anyway.  Old hat wig.  So I guess the Wild Bumper stickers are being made.  Yeah.  I don't know how the stations are giving them away.  I guess each station is doing it a different way.  Hopefully going to events and all that.  Just get them.  And do the self-addressed stamped envelope thing.  Affiliates, please.  Have them just send self-addressed envelopes to your radio station to send out the Wild stickers.  That works very, very well. 
[00:07:30]  Well, they call it snail mail, Opie.  Isn't that funny?  No, it's not.  Well, I think it is because it rhymes and snails are slow.  Slow.  I feel like crap today.  What happened?  Well, because I don't eat sweets.  But I decided for my birthday to have lots and lots of sweets.  Did you eat cake and candy?  The last two or three days, it was all about eating a lot of cake, a lot of ice cream.  People feel compelled to get you numerous cakes on your birthday. 
[00:08:00]  How many?  We had two just at work.  And then would you have a little cake when you went out last night?  I sure did.  Some cake.  I sure did.  And I would advise not to go into that bathroom anytime soon.  Did the cake leave a lasting impression with you?  The sweets go in all nice.  They go in nice.  That's why they call them sweets.  Oh, they taste so yummy.  They look great.  They come out a little sour.  It's a different situation a day later.  Once your system gets a hold of it and pulls the sugary goodness out, what's left? 
[00:08:30]  I'm feeling a little weird today.  I just don't eat like that.  Looks like something that wipes out a village somewhere in some awful part of the world.  Yeah, horrid.  So Opie comes out of the bathroom, shuts the door and goes, don't go in there for two hours.  Like he knows how long it's going to take to defuse.  Oh, it was awful.  I hope there's a fan in there, isn't there?  Oh, it was just.  I mean, literally, someone that enjoys this program.  I hate them all. 
[00:09:00]  No filter, Paul.  Just standing there with that awful Lego hairdo watching.  This is horrible.  It was stupid limey.  It was just horrific.  And also, I'm a little bit nauseous today as well because of my birthday celebration.  Nauseous.  No drinking.  No?  No.  There's no drinking during school nights.  Very difficult.  You can't drink during school nights.  Were you just jumping up and down, yelling cake?  Well, Lindsay surprised me with a helicopter ride around Manhattan.  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard about this. 
[00:09:30]  We were not happy.  I heard from my agent.  I got a call from him, and I guess he had put in a call to Opie and had heard that you  were out on a helicopter ride.  And he told me, and I just went, oh, really?  I was just horrified.  I'm there with the phone in my hand.  Like, I just got a bad call at three in the morning.  I guess everyone was in a slight panic.  Well, nobody, none of us, wants any of us to do anything the slightest bit dangerous. 
[00:10:00]  We should all leave the show and be put in play pens with soft little foam toys to play  with.  When Kenny, I went with Kenny and Opie yesterday, and Kenny dropped Opie off, and then Kenny,  in a conspiratorial tone, leans over and goes, Lindsay's taking him on a helicopter ride  today, and I was livid.  Yeah.  I want, here's what you do for your birthdays from now on.  You know those things that kids have?  It looks like a giant gumball machine, but it's all rubber, and you jump up and down, 
[00:10:30]  and the kids play, and they might fall, but they bounce right back up.  Oh, like the ball pit.  Yes.  Yeah, and they jump in and have fun.  That's what you should do for your birthdays.  Jump up and down and bounce off the soft rubber wall, and maybe fall down on the soft rubber  thing.  I was really not happy with that.  Not take helicopter rides.  How about this?  Once this show is off, and you retire, and everybody is doing well, you can take a helicopter  ride like Omar from Scarface, for all I care. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  I don't think his was much fun.  Well, it was definitely cool.  Definitely cool.  I don't care if some little Asian girl throws her pointy hat in as you're taking off.  That was your helicopter ride.  Oh, there's a flare.  There's a flare.  Give me my coffee. 
[00:11:30]  Well, yeah, our agent called as I was putting on the life preserver.  Yeah, like that's going to help.  I was looking at that life preserver like, yeah, right.  Like that's going to help when you hit the Hudson.  Yeah, okay.  And I can hear it in his voice.  He's like, really?  Yeah.  They're very loud, too, right?  You wear the headphones, and you got to talk to each other through the mic?  No, you can't talk to anybody.  You just listen to the pilot.  Oh.  I was going to ask you, how long of a ride do you actually go on? 
[00:12:00]  It's only like 12 minutes.  Okay.  That's all it is.  You take off from like 30th Street on the West Side Highway.  Yeah, you got the heliport right there on the West Side Highway.  For the people that don't know anything about New York, it's around the Empire State Building,  you know, but on the water, obviously.  And then you go take a loop around the Statue of Liberty.  Ain't that something when it comes up and then that nose dips down so they could go forward?  Yeah.  It feels like you're going right into the water.  Is that how it feels? 
[00:12:30]  I've never been on a heliport.  Oh, yeah.  And then some serious turns to get around the Statue of Liberty.  And then we are right outside your building, Jimmy.  Really?  You could have been waving at me.  Did you see him in this window doing something horrible to himself?  It'd be funny if me and, let's just say, a black lady with a blonde wig look out,  and I just see him and his girlfriend waving at us from my heliport.  Who are those people waving, Daddy?  No, just close the window.  Close the shades.  Quick.  She's waving going, happy birthday, Daddy.  Happy birthday, blonde Daddy. 
[00:13:00]  So we flew right by your apartment.  How high are you when you're doing this, like by the Statue of Liberty?  Oh, I don't even know.  Are you high-to-eye with it?  No, no, way higher.  Yeah, you're probably up a couple thousand feet.  I would say at least a half mile.  Oh, really?  At least.  That's pretty high.  A half mile's high?  Yeah.  That's 2,600 feet?  Yeah.  That's about right.  Really?  For a tour?  Are you higher than the Empire State Building?  Yes.  I'm higher than every building in New York.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Unless it just looked like I was higher. 
[00:13:30]  No, I was higher than all the buildings.  Maybe not the Empire State Building.  So maybe like 1,000 feet in the air.  I could see Central Park, no problem, from the water.  Yeah.  I mean, the whole park.  See, I'd want to take a helicopter ride that maybe went 100 or 200 feet.  A half a mile up is, how high is that?  2,600 feet.  What?  A mile's about 5,200 feet.  Yeah.  2,600 feet.  Wait, wait.  5,200 feet.  5,281 feet is a mile.  Is a mile.  2,600 is about half.  So probably –  The Empire State Building is probably maybe 1,100 or 1,200 feet to the top. 
[00:14:00]  I love when we do math.  About 1,000 feet.  Because we're horrid at it.  That means that you're – I don't think you're a half mile.  It's over two times as high as the Empire State Building.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know the tower was like 1,300 feet to the top of the tower at the Trade Center.  So that's about – that's always the comparison I make when I know how high that was.  Yeah.  Find a new one.  The Freedom Tower.  And you fly right over Ground Zero or, you know, off of Ground Zero over the water.  Yeah.  You don't go over the city at all, right?  It's only the water.  No. 
[00:14:30]  It's completely –  Does the pilot get all somber with his little tour over there?  Nah.  And this.  No.  The guy was just beyond cool.  And it's just sad to see Ground Zero from the air.  What's his deal?  Like the pilot?  He didn't – I don't know.  How old?  Oh, God.  22?  Really?  Just a kid?  23?  Carson?  Ooh.  Daily?  No.  Carson with blonde hair.  Really?  Looks like how my nephew's going to look when he gets older.  You kind of want a Vietnam –  My brother's got a kid named Carson. 
[00:15:00]  You kind of want a Vietnam chopper pilot in there.  Not some 22-year-old kid that just got out of flight school.  He's probably, I don't know, like 27, late 20s.  Yeah.  Maybe Pops.  Maybe Gulf War.  I don't know.  You don't get to know your pilot.  I had to chit-chat with him a little bit.  You don't get to know anything.  It's 12 minutes.  Hmm.  Maybe I'll do that someday.  But it was a great surprise, and I had a lot of fun.  Were you scared?  Not really, because I did a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon when we weren't doing radio. 
[00:15:30]  Now, that's just tragic, because –  That was scary, because I don't know, the drafts or the wind, how the winds happen over the Grand Canyon,  you feel the helicopter struggling to go forward.  Yeah.  As soon as it makes the turn back to base or whatever, the helicopter just completely takes off,  because now it's with the wind.  But as they're trying to get into the middle of the Grand Canyon for the photo ops, it's just struggling.  Leaning forward.  You can feel it, like, pushing forward, pushing back, pushing forward, pushing back. 
[00:16:00]  And a high percentage of copters that go down in New York, the people make it.  For some reason, your altitude, I guess, is low enough, and you've got a lot of water.  That seems to be something to hit, aside from the ground.  The Grand Canyon, oh, people go right into canyon walls.  They just hit down in a chasm.  And they've got all sorts of drafts and stuff.  You're done for.  They explain how dangerous it really is to fly over the Grand Canyon. 
[00:16:30]  But one of these helicopters in New York went down recently.  I think it was on the east side.  Yeah.  Right?  On the east side, one of these helicopter tours went down.  And I was thinking that as we were in the air.  Did people die?  I think they all got out on that one, on the most recent one.  But it was a nice birthday.  I want to thank everybody on the message boards for wishing me a happy birthday.  That was very, very nice.  I appreciate that, believe it or not.  People are saying, yeah, you shouldn't do anything where you have to put on a life preserver. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Hey, Lindsey, don't endanger our Opie.  The circle line would have been dangerous enough.  Could have taken a little circle line tour around Manhattan.  As I was saying, for the franchise's birthday, how about next year, just a rubber ball to bounce against the wall and laugh?  How about some laughter with a rubber ball?  All right, we're going to take a break, because when we get back, I've got to play the clip of Stalker Patty from yesterday's show.  This was the highlight of our show over at XM.  The second half of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, my God.  We're bringing this to everyone's attention over here, because it just made me very, very happy.  Old chimpanzee scream.  Yeah, Stalker Patty.  Is that what they call her?  Stalker Patty screaming for her life, and us singing happy birthday.  And laughing at her.  And laughing at her.  We're going to do that next on the Opie and Anthony show, and get into some fine, fine radio today, okay?  All right.  Right-o.  All right, it's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I will be you with Mount Wednesday. 
[00:18:00]  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  ONA, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Opie and Anthony.  Morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202.  Tuesday.  Anthony!  I just did it, and it worked.  Really?  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:18:30]  Thanks for checking us out this morning.  Lots to do today.  Hey, quickly, about the helicopter thing you were just talking about.  I took a little helicopter ride for your birthday, much to our chagrin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, you know, we got 80,000 people that we employ alone, Opie.  80,000 people depend on our jobs.  Was there any security screening over there?  What do they do from the time you pull up to that chopper port, if I may call it a chopper port? 
[00:19:00]  You get a locker, and you throw your cell phone and your wallet in the locker, and then they throw a vest on you.  Do you run through security?  I mean, do they wand you?  A little metal detector.  A metal detector.  Actually, you're not allowed to take anything on the helicopter except for a camera.  A camera.  A camera.  So no bags?  No pocketbooks?  Nothing, no.  Nothing.  No.  And I was thinking that a lot of people depend on us for their careers.  I know. 
[00:19:30]  And it's just kind of strange to take those slight risks in life every once in a while.  When we were off for two years, when we had a two-year exile, then it was fine to, you know, like Kane from Kung Fu, walk the earth, get in adventures, things like that.  But now, there's so many people that depend on you.  And when it was just the Opie and Anthony show consisting of Opie and Anthony.  Right.  Back in the old days up in Boston. 
[00:20:00]  I do think that sometimes, though.  I'm way above Manhattan going, man, there's too many people that depend on me for their livelihood.  Yeah.  Maybe this isn't a good idea.  At least I'm not, like, inline skating in Manhattan these days holding on to backs of trucks anymore.  I've kind of backed off on that.  Well, that's a good thing.  No more sketching on your skates.  I still do it in Central Park from time to time.  In 2003, 2004, Opie would skate.  I'd be like, ah, take your helmet off, faggot.  Who cares, right?  Nowadays, you've got to be semi-safe because I've become worried. 
[00:20:30]  When we were on Terrestrial Radio before we got fired, we actually had a general manager say, could you not do that anymore?  Yeah.  When we signed a pretty huge syndication deal, they're like, just do us one favor.  Do not inline skate around Manhattan holding on to the backs of trucks anymore, please.  They were none too happy about that one.  Well, I just casually talked about it on the air because we talk about our lives.  And there was also a meeting after the show.  I'm like, what is this about?  It was like an intervention.  It was an intervention with the suits at Infinity Broadcasting. 
[00:21:00]  Could you not do that anymore, please?  So now we've just got to be careful.  So many people depend on us.  That's a little strange.  All right.  Hey, very good observation by Anthony.  Brad Pitt.  Brad Pitt in the paper today.  Yeah, they love taking pictures of Brad Pitt these days.  These days?  Forever.  Forever.  Forever.  They've been taking his picture for decades.  The guy is the definitive guy that can just go out and get any chick at any time. 
[00:21:30]  Doesn't matter.  You could just be hanging out at a bar with your girlfriend.  If Brad Pitt walks in, he's going to be having sex with her.  And you couldn't even get mad at her.  You can't get mad.  There's nothing you can do about it.  Nothing you can do.  Finish your drink.  And wait in the car.  And wait in the car for her to come back with a big smile on her face.  When she goes to the kiss, you go, no, wait.  You get something right there to clean your mouth. 
[00:22:00]  And that's pretty much it.  But for some reason, instead of pictures of him having sex with women or him with women that he's having sex with, all we see these days, and this picture is a perfect example, is him with children of questionable ethnicity, riding bicycles, carrying them in papooses.  And it can't be fun.  Has this guy just had his quota of sex with beautiful women? 
[00:22:30]  And do you reach that point as a guy?  Don't look at me for an answer.  Oh, Jesus.  But as a guy like Brad Pitt, do you just reach a point where it's like, I'm done.  I'd rather go to Guajalupa and carry around children that you cannot possibly see even after dusk.  He'd rather go to a click-clack nation.  Yeah, where they speak in click-clack. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, he could be getting laid every single moment.  Every second.  Instead, he's in Africa.  And there's a big to-do about the picture in the paper today because, I guess, the baby on his back as he's riding a bike.  Yeah.  And another.  He's got one strapped to his back.  Right, I guess the baby or the kid strapped to his back isn't strapped to his back right as they take a bike ride in Africa.  In Africa.  Well, yeah, you've got to be safe, you know, because they grow up very safe there. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  They're lucky if they're not dead before they're eight weeks because of the mojadeen.  Yeah, they chop them up with machetes.  This is the safest thing you could do in Africa.  Is being strapped to Brad Pitt's back.  Right.  That is like, that's an airbag.  He's an airbag.  He's better than an airbag.  But they're all pissed off.  If you know the dangers in Africa, I think the kid's going to be okay strapped to Brad Pitt's back as they go for a little bike ride.  It's not quite Britney with the car seat backwards.  She's fine, too.  Yeah, I know.  That is absolutely fine. 
[00:24:00]  Who cares?  Enough with Britney Spears.  I hate Britney Spears, but enough about Britney Spears being a bad mom.  Endangering her child.  Oh, my God.  I remember taking rides as a kid out to see my grandma in Waiting River.  And we had a Volkswagen bus.  Yeah.  And my parents decided to take the seats out because it could, you know, fit more kids.  You have so many kids in a family.  It could fit more kids in the Volkswagen bus because we had like seven and then we always were adopting somebody or taking somebody in.  My parents. 
[00:24:30]  You're a wacky family.  My parents being do-gooders.  Charitable.  Ugh.  Good.  Charitable.  Also, I'm like, who's this?  Oh, it's your sister, Karen.  But she's 15 years old.  I don't remember her before now.  That would have been great, though.  Just like now you have a live-in girlfriend.  Also, I had a sister for three years.  She called my sister.  I'm like...  Was she hot?  Yeah, she was all right.  Did you have sex with her?  No, I didn't have sex with her.  Why?  I was just a little cut.  It's not... 
[00:25:00]  It's like, oh, oh, I thought maybe you were...  I was a little cut.  And then one day, Karen just disappeared.  And I haven't seen her since.  Uh-oh.  So the Volkswagen bus, they would take the seats out so they could fit more kids inside.  That's safe.  And I remember also riding out to Waiting River to see my grandma, and I would be at  my mom's feet.  She would be in the passenger seat, and I would be sleeping in between her feet on the floor.  On the floorboard?  And no seatbelt. 
[00:25:30]  No.  No seatbelt put in backwards, because that's the way it should be put in.  If you ever saw the seatbelts in the cars when I was growing up, the seatbelt was always  stuffed under the seat.  And then if you ever did pull it out or see it, the strap was like a Frito.  It was just like this brittle, bent-up thing that had no pliability left to it.  And you didn't need it anyway, because when Dad would jam on the brakes, he would take his  right arm and move it over your chest to hold you back. 
[00:26:00]  And that works in any accident situation.  Everybody knows that's the safest thing a child could have in a car, is Dad's right  arm to hold you back.  Tell me you don't do it, though, now.  What?  I do that same maneuver.  You have kids in your car?  No.  Well, when the hell does that happen?  No, I mean, but I do that.  If I'm driving a car.  If you're in a seatbelt, or are you just trying to cop a cheap feel?  If I'm driving.  I hope he's jamming on the brakes, just grabbing.  And they're in the driveway.  Sorry, I wanted to make sure you're safe. 
[00:26:30]  No, if I'm driving, and it doesn't matter who the passenger is, and all of a sudden we're  coming to a quick stop, I'll put my arm across.  Is it just reflex?  I guess.  Because the seatbelt really does take care of everything like that these days.  Dude, it's a reef.  I've actually done that with Patrice in my passenger seat.  Oof.  Other guys.  You just put your arm out for some reason, and you think that's going to help, and it  doesn't.  You just look like a faggot.  What?  Yeah.  I have never given thought to anybody in my passenger seat as far as what I could do 
[00:27:00]  to help them in a short stop, or even an accident, or anything.  It's a reaction.  Because you don't give a crap about anyone else.  At a boil.  No, it's-  Thank you, Jimmy.  It's about time we say it.  I just have complete trust in the Cadillac Escalade.  Yes, the Escalade Drive in luxury and safety in the Cadillac Escalade.  Wait till you see the video that's on the news today.  I mean, every day you get the video of the day.  That's what I love about TV these days.  And they have that SUV just rolling across the highway. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, great footage this morning.  And the passenger was fine because he had the seatbelts and the airbags.  Yeah, they got airbags that come out of everywhere now.  The best part of the video, when you see it later, this car starts rolling across the highway, just missing someone in the granny lane.  And they just keep going like, eh, no big deal.  I ain't stopping for that.  As the car is off the side of the road in the trees.  I don't stop for accidents either, although I did stop for one recently.  But if I see a really bad wreck and you see it happen, there ain't no stopping. 
[00:28:00]  I don't want that affecting me.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  You're going to be that guy that stops, gets out, runs up to the upside down car, looks in, and sees like seven-year-old kids with their heads chopped off.  Oh, I'm a good Samaritan, and now I got to go to therapy and live with that image in my head?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I see it in my rear view and go, oh, that looks bad.  I hope the EMS guys get there quickly.  How about you get out maybe and help one of the little rascals out of the car?  Sorry, Charlie.  There it is.  Look.  Tumble, tumble, tumble.  Roll, roll, roll. 
[00:28:30]  They're going to show this video all day long.  See, if I saw that, you know what I would do?  Oh, that's rough.  I'd hit my OnStar, and I'd go, hi.  OnStar.  Yeah, OnStar.  Just saw a bad wreck.  I have your location here.  Yeah, I know you do.  Okay, bye.  Send someone, because I'm not stopping.  I don't need to see what was a human being and is now hamburger.  Well, caddy Jimmy cares.  No, you don't.  Because I stop, and I would make a phone call and call 911. 
[00:29:00]  You do it right from your, Jimmy, you do it right from your OnStar.  But while I'm on my OnStar, I couldn't be over there giving words of encouragement.  Shut up.  Words of encouragement.  Me and my friend were coming back from an airport one time in New Brunswick, and we saw  this car wipe out.  And I don't know how these guys did it, man, but they slammed against a fire hydrant, and  the one guy's passenger, the guy went through the passenger window, but he was still in the  car, but his arm, a piece of the passenger door had opened like a sardine can and trapped 
[00:29:30]  his arm between the passenger door and the fire hydrant.  That's what I want to say.  But he was talking.  Yeah.  But his arm was pinned.  Oh, they'll talk for a little while.  No, he was okay.  He was alive, but he was-  Till their eyes roll back white.  Let's drink to your arm.  Lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes.  And we helped.  We gave them encouraging words.  What, did you shake your little box of tendered sentiments and give them one?  You mad her.  Learn to play the piano, Lefty.  Let's go to Glenn in Philly.  What's up, Glenn? 
[00:30:00]  Hey, guys.  Love you, Jimmy.  Thanks, Glenn.  Welcome aboard.  When I was a kid, Pennsylvania didn't have a seatbelt law, but Jersey did.  When we ever went to the shore, we sat around, hopping around in the back seat.  As soon as we crossed that bridge, we put the belt on.  And on our way back, as soon as we crossed back into Pennsylvania, those seatbelts came  off and we were jumping around in the back seat again.  You could crawl around the car like, that's what you did as a kid.  You'd crawl around your car.  Your father would like, get back, sit down, sit down.  And you'd crawl up on, there was that rear deck lid by the back window where they put 
[00:30:30]  the bad speakers, usually, that was full of french fries and cookie crumbs that would  bounce and make a tinny sound when the music would play.  And you'd lay down up there.  Like that wasn't, like you weren't going to become a projectile that would just go right  through your dad's head and the windshield if he hit anything.  There was no safety.  No one cared.  That's why I laugh.  Once again, when you see the picture of Britney Spears not buckling her kid in right in a  car or she's driving and holding the kid. 
[00:31:00]  That's dangerous.  Whatever.  That's what happened when we were growing up.  What's the age cutoff?  25 and older.  We remember like not really wearing seatbelts or it was the dumb seatbelt that just went  across your waist.  Just the lap belt so your teeth can still hit the steering wheel.  So it would just cut you in half, basically.  I think it's 30s, though.  I'm 37.  I remember being in my friend's father's car and him making it hate it, too.  I got motion sick in the back seat.  He made me put my seatbelt on.  But that's probably when I was, that's probably 30 years ago. 
[00:31:30]  Not only did we not have proper seatbelts growing up, my first car was the Dodge Aspen  wagon.  Nice.  That's a chick magnet at the school.  You run them over and then put them in the back seat.  That's the only way you're getting them in it.  And see, I'm from Centipore, Long Island.  Yes.  Went to Harborfields High School.  And Harborfields High School was known for having a lot of rich kids.  It was?  Yeah.  It was like hell on earth being the poor kid going to a rich high school or a richer 
[00:32:00]  high school because they got even richer in other high schools on Long Island.  So they're all driving to school and there's sobs and brand new beamers.  Most famous person to come out of your high school?  Mariah Carey.  Oh, it wasn't you?  No, I'm second.  Mariah?  You're second.  Actually, they had like some kind of poll recently and I'm second.  Yeah, I made first in mine.  Did you really?  Yeah, John Glenn.  What about you, Jimmy?  I have no idea if there was a poll.  Um, I don't know. 
[00:32:30]  But I go to Joel Rifkin Memorial High School when I was a kid.  I went to John H. Glenn High School.  It's out there on Long Island in Elwood.  And they wanted John Glenn.  They named the school and then wanted astronaut John Glenn to come to the school and he wouldn't.  Why?  I don't know.  He might be a prick.  What a dick.  I don't know.  We just decided he did not want to come to a school that was named after him.  Well, if you name a school, Jim Norton, the Jim Norton Memorial School of whatever you want to call it.  I should have worn something. 
[00:33:00]  I will certainly show up.  I want a big breathe right strip over the front doors.  I want Opie Day at Harborfields High School.  Good luck.  I want Opie Day.  But anyway, so, you know, the kids would drive to school in their brand new cars and mommy and daddy bought them.  Beamers and stuff.  Nice.  And my dad was able to, you know, find a Dodge Aspen wagon.  Here you go, son.  That was at least 15 years old at the time.  And the back doors, I've told this story a few times on the air, the back doors would not close properly. 
[00:33:30]  So my dad, instead of, you know, maybe taking it to the local garage and spending $100 to get the doors to close properly,  he decided that the best thing to do was take a wire, a metal wire.  Like bailing wire.  And tie it from one door handle to the other all the way across the car.  On the inside of the car?  Yes.  So if you were driving in my car in high school back in the day and you had the back seat.  And you put people in the back seat. 
[00:34:00]  They would sit between, the metal wire basically would be in front of them.  Ah!  Almost like a, you know.  Exactly.  What happens if you hit something?  It would not be good.  You have twice as many friends.  It would not be good.  Yeah, because you would be sitting in the back seat.  No seatbelts, by the way.  You kind of hold on to the metal wire in front of you.  Oh, yeah, that'll keep you up.  And the metal wire would be really, really tight because I had to keep the doors closed.  And that's how I drove around in high school. 
[00:34:30]  Man, it was a chick magnet, I gotta tell you.  Oh, yeah.  Certainly.  Use that wire in the back to put around their necks.  But anyway, getting back to Brad Pitt, we just went off on a little bit of a tangent.  You were talking about Angelina Jolie.  Angelina Jolie.  Yeah.  She is some type of demon or witch.  She made Billy Bob Thornton wear like blood around his neck and get all kinds of wacky tattoos  that I'm sure he's regretting now.  And now look what she's done to Brad Pitt.  You look into her eyes, I think, and your brain turns to stone. 
[00:35:00]  And next thing you know, you're in Africa riding a bicycle with something on your back.  I don't know.  It's like a WB sitcom.  Yeah.  What the hell is he doing?  I don't know.  And make a movie or something.  Like, the guy's a star.  He can be getting any girl he wants.  And he's bicycling on what looks like the plains of the Serengeti. 
[00:35:30]  It's not even a trail.  You do understand he will not be allowed to make any more movies, right?  No.  Because that's where he met Angelina Jolie.  Yep.  Let's not forget, he was with Jennifer Aniston, went on set for Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  And that was it.  And that was it.  He's banging Angelina Jolie.  So you think Angelina Jolie's going to trust him enough to go do a movie somewhere?  With some young starlet.  Right.  I don't know.  That ain't happening anytime soon.  I think part of their attraction to each other, look, I just caught myself with an entertainment. 
[00:36:00]  I actually was going to speculate on the Brad and Angelina.  The Brangelina.  This is faggot number three.  But the fact is, when you're that good looking and you can sleep with anybody, I mean, it's like they're both in the same position.  It's almost like, look, I know I can bang anyone and still could you, so let's be, like, faithful to each other.  So let's just grab some African children and ride around on bicycles with them.  I kind of like her, though, because she's amazingly attractive. 
[00:36:30]  And she's not acting like a typical hot chick.  You know what?  Someone thinks for other people.  I cannot take those huge lips of hers.  Oh, I want to kiss them.  Oh, no.  And you know why?  They don't look kissable or nice or smooth or soft.  They are always like, they should be in a chapstick ad.  They're just these flaky mess of lips that she cannot, it looks like she's constantly trying to keep them moist.  Oh, it's fine.  No, horrible.  They're lovely to kiss. 
[00:37:00]  I don't, I don't, I don't find her attractive.  That African sun pride.  Great body on her.  I'll give her that.  Angelina Jolie.  Yeah, good body on her.  But, but as far as her face, the lips are too, too much.  You can't get past them.  I'd wear her uterus around my neck.  All right.  Billy Bob bailed out of that one.  And speaking of cars, we went on a tangent about cars there.  Off on a tangent, I should say.  Well, in the paper today, Hillary Clinton, she's going to solve the gas problem. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, here we go.  You know, obviously gas is just out of control.  Yeah.  And Hillary thinks that we should just bring the, bring the, the speed limit down a notch.  National speed limit back down to 55.  She wants back to double nickels.  That'll, that'll solve the gas crisis.  Yeah, because, you know, all of her motorcades and everything just travel at 55.  That'll solve the rising gas prices.  You don't see them wing and past you at 80 miles an hour whenever you see a political motorcade go by. 
[00:38:00]  This out of touch dummy that she is.  Video games are bad and let's lower the speed limit.  Yeah.  You dumb soccer mom.  Shut your face.  All that does, especially these days.  I got to say, the way cars are built these days, very fuel efficient for the most part.  A lot of us, uh, SUV drivers are, you know, we're the bad guys, but screw you.  Uh, but a lot of cars built these days, the difference between 55 and 60 is none. 
[00:38:30]  No difference to, to gas mileage in newer cars.  And as far as safety goes, cause it was always a safety thing.  Also, uh, the way cars are built these days, it's safer too.  You know how hard it is to drive 55 on a highway?  Impossible.  It's hard to drive under 70.  80.  Do it.  I'm being fair though here, you know, under 70, it's, it's almost impossible.  Every morning driving in 80 miles an hour, the entire way down the expressway.  Cause there's no traffic.  And if I slow up to like 75, I'm thinking I'm crawling at 55, get out of here. 
[00:39:00]  The 55 mile an hour speed limit is a joke.  They, they came up with this so many years ago when cars weren't a safe.  Yeah.  They weren't a safe or fuel efficient.  So, you know, the difference between 55 and 60 made up a pretty significant difference in gas overall.  But now it really doesn't.  When the speed limit is 65, that's a joke.  Yeah.  How about this?  You want to cut down on gas prices, deal with these scumbies.  Some bag Middle Eastern countries or the oil companies here a little bit harsher. 
[00:39:30]  Stupid.  How about that?  They'll make us drive slower cause you can't get it done as a, as a government official.  How is gas eight bucks a gallon now?  You know where there's a lot of oil?  Mexico.  Mexico has a lot of oil.  Leave Alaska alone.  Oh, people want to let pristine.  Who's going there?  Leave it alone.  I like, I like the cute animals.  They show them on TV every once in a while.  Bunch of fat faced idiots and igloos.  How about this?  Knock over their houses and take the oil.  I like when you see like a, a cruise ship. 
[00:40:00]  Fat face.  I like, I like when you see a cruise ship and it's, and it's going by, by like an iceberg.  Well, there ain't going to be a pump right there.  You can hide them.  We got plenty of places to put them.  Leave the Alaska wilderness alone.  Alaska stinks dry.  Leave it alone.  Every, everybody in Alaska looks like they starred in Orca 2.  Send over a big rig, take the oil, and we can drive cheaper.  No one cares about Alaska.  Leave them alone.  Pump Alaska dry.  How many people have actually been to Alaska? 
[00:40:30]  No one.  The percentage has to be in the point something of a percent.  It can't even be 1% of Americans have been to Alaska.  But never mind care about it.  You care about it because you see it on the news that you should care about it.  It's not like they're going to just put rigs everywhere, put them where there's some oil, pump some out, and let us drive.  You know what's great about that?  We'll drill in the Alaskan wilderness, right?  And the gas prices will remain the same.  Of course they will.  Because weren't they supposed to drop drastically when we invaded Iraq? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, you know, the war for oil.  Isn't part of the problem there's no refineries because the environmentalists won't allow them to?  Yeah, that's a biggie in the United States.  We used to have refineries.  Now we have less.  We're not building new ones because, yeah, a lot of people said, oh, they're bad for the environment.  So it made us depend on foreign oil more.  Now we're paying the price.  Mexico, though, has so much oil under there.  But there's such a corrupt, awful nation that is impossible to deal with that we can't even get their oil. 
[00:41:30]  You need to invade them.  Hey, Chris in Boston.  Hey, Ed, is Opie sweet on Alaska because of March of the Penguins?  Yeah.  I was going to ask you, idiot.  It was the South Pole.  How about the same place?  Jackass.  How about this?  We allow Mexican immigrants to come over if they have a barrel of oil strapped to their back.  Usually it's just absorbed into their shirt.  A new program.  Bring out your socks when you cross the border.  Right.  Darn it, you got me.  I was going to say, a new program. 
[00:42:00]  Bring a gallon.  You're allowed in.  Shake your head into this barrel, Rodriguez.  They put your head into one of those things, like a juicer.  You squeeze your hair into somebody's engine.  If we could squeeze a gallon out of you, you get to stay.  You get to stay a month.  If you're short a gallon, you got to go back and try again.  Bring us oil.  We can dab your taint with a rag.  We're spoiled Americans.  Bring us our oil.  Hey, by the way, Hillary Clinton, getting back to her. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Good news, guys.  Good news.  Oh, some good news.  Clinton's no fan of the Mets.  Remember there was a controversy here in New York?  Yeah.  Because.  When she was running for Senate.  What the hell is ringing?  Something's going beep.  It's not your pebble.  Is your pebble running out of battery juice?  Why don't you just turn it off?  Battery juice.  Yeah.  I turn my phone off.  I leave it in the other room.  I don't even pretend I don't have one phone.  All right.  Sorry about that.  So there was a controversy because people were trying. 
[00:43:00]  What?  I didn't even hear what you guys were saying.  Nothing.  Just the phone.  It's the ever-present Opie Pebble phone.  What's wrong with the pebble?  I got the pebble.  Nothing's wrong with that.  I want to treat it like one and skip it across a lake.  The pebble is all the rage now.  I told you.  All you people.  This week.  All you people out there that went for the Razor.  Ha, ha.  You know what?  The Razor stinks.  My Verizon phone, it's the worst piece of equipment I've ever owned.  I almost bit it the other day.  Don't doubt it.  You like to bite things.  My Bluetooth sucks. 
[00:43:30]  I'm so unhappy with this stupid phone with the touchscreen.  You got buttons on your phone.  Jimmy, let me ask you something before we get back to Hillary.  Quickly.  Do you go online and go to Consumer Reports and do research on phones or electronics when  you go to buy them?  No.  But this one was actually a pretty...  It's a brand new phone.  Sprint has them.  It's the kind that...  It looks like a square and then you push it and it opens up into a different, smaller  keyboard.  Windows on a phone.  Stinks.  It's slow.  They're getting very... 
[00:44:00]  They're trying to introduce that and it's not quite...  It's bombing horribly as far as my life is concerned because touchscreen never works  because you're trying to drive.  You're going to hit a pole and you're hitting the button and it doesn't register that you  hit the button.  Even though the little keypad on the screen went down, it looks like you pushed the button  but you didn't push the button.  You go to some kind of consumer thing.  You can even put whatever you want to buy in Yahoo and then you'll get answers from  people.  You get their review of that item and you read through it and go, oh my God, this is a piece  of crap and then it's good you didn't buy it and then you find something that you like 
[00:44:30]  that seems to be good based on other people's experience with it, Jimmy.  That's the future.  Palm software is much better than a phone.  I got to tell you, Anthony and I think you look ridiculous with your Bluetooth, by the  way.  I can't.  You're not made for the Bluetooth.  Your ears are too small.  I hate the things hanging out of people's ears when they are talking.  You know who's into the Bluetooth?  Who?  The cab drivers here in New York City.  They're all about the Bluetooth.  You used to get in a cab and hopefully they'd never say a word to you. 
[00:45:00]  Now you get in and they go, I got no, and you're like, you lean forward, excuse me?  And then you realize he's just talking to some other guy, plodding.  Yeah.  I'm just going to remember the cell.  Sorry.  Yeah.  They just talk the entire time now, the cab drivers, because they got the Bluetooths.  The Bluetooths.  There's other guys that, they got the little ones and then there's guys you look over  driving next to you and he thinks he's a fighter pilot.  He's got like the Apache helicopter helmet on and he's chatting with his friends. 
[00:45:30]  Those work better though.  The Bluetooth.  You have to.  I'm afraid of head cancer and I'm afraid of holding that.  Do you think a Bluetooth is going to help you from head cancer?  Yes, it helps.  I'm sure.  I believe it does.  They haven't even proven though that the cell phone gives you the head cancer.  I know, but I'm being, you know, when am I going to prove it?  When I have a tangerine growing on my skull?  Right.  Jimmy's for prevention.  He doesn't want 20 years to go by.  You don't think that Bluetooth in your ear might give off a little something?  All of a sudden they go, yep, you got a tumor.  He's not waiting for that day.  Absolutely.  There's going to be a bunch of people.  Pound, ounce of prevention is worth a pound of AIDS. 
[00:46:00]  I hate my phone.  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  So we'll talk about the Hillary thing when we get back.  I'm going to talk to her fat ankles.  Well, then that stupid phone I have.  Her cankles.  We'll also laugh at all the people that went out and got those dumb Razor phones.  Most people I hear hate the Razor.  Yeah.  I told you it was all about the Pebble.  Very hard to dial.  I told you it was all about the Pebble.  And now they come in some fine colors.  What colors?  Tell me later.  The paper has a whole bunch of new colors you can get with the Pebble. 
[00:46:30]  You need a flip phone, first of all.  One that opens, that doesn't have exposed keys.  Yes.  Because you're constantly, believe it or not, you're calling people, idiots.  I'm taking phone calls from this.  And all I hear is,  I think I'm going to take a left over here.  What do you want to do tonight?  I don't know.  Let's just go.  What about Anthony?  What a dick he is.  Isn't he?  I usually hang up before that.  Sorry, Anthony.  That was before I got the flip phone.  When I get the errand phone call from someone that dialed me on Autodile because they don't  have a flip phone, I hang up immediately because I'm afraid they're going to say something 
[00:47:00]  bad about me.  That's how I feel.  Ben has that happen all the time.  Oh.  I haven't even talked.  Get a flip phone.  I haven't even talked to Ben about it, but I get more phone calls from you that you  have no idea you're making.  Oh, really?  Because Ben calls me a lot after the show, and then all of a sudden it's just Ben on  some street corner somewhere asking for directions.  I've identified sounds.  One was, it took me the longest time, is a 20 being rolled up, and the other is something  being sniffed.  And the clanking of glasses and bar revelry. 
[00:47:30]  My hooligans.  It sounds like bar flyers calling you.  A drink from my parental friends.  My favorite one ever, my sister's phone called me, and she's in her car, and she's just singing  to the faggiest song, just some awful soccer mom type song.  And they never know.  At the top of her lungs, has no idea that her phone called me, and I'm just sitting there  listening in.  They never know.  Somebody had Colin, because that dummy calls you and has no idea how to use his technology. 
[00:48:00]  And I think it was Nick or Bobby that had Colin, after he hung up, he didn't actually  hang up.  So he had Colin, who was home typing on his computer, talking to himself in a French accent.  I will do this, monsieur, and I will do this.  He's insane.  He did that fat-headed dope, and somebody had it on record.  I'm like, why didn't you save that?  Of course.  It's a classic.  Oh, just talking to himself in a French accent.  What an ass.  What a dope.  All right, we're going to take our break here. 
[00:48:30]  We'll talk about Hillary next, okay?  Also, please stick around.  Please stick around.  We got the Starker Patty thing from yesterday.  I think this is hilarious.  We had her screaming for-  Horror.  It's like something out of Saw.  Like the Adam and the movie Saw, where someone's being entertained by somebody's horror.  We had her screaming for her life as we were singing happy birthday to me.  And laughing at her.  This is the one virus spreading across America.  I love showing my introverted fat guys.  Whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:49:00]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Opie and Anthony.  Weekday mornings.  Hey, it's Whip them out Wednesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't forget to get your WOW bumper stickers.  Just keep listening to the radio station that you're hearing us on.  The XM Nation, they already know how to get their WOW bumper stickers.  WOW is great.  Yeah, and once summer really kicks in and the girls are a little more scantily clad, let's say, more easily accessible, in some parts of the country they already are. 
[00:49:30]  Not here in New York where we've missed spring for some reason.  Do you know, I watched the weather yesterday.  Do you know it was 85 degrees in Bismarck, North Dakota?  And it was what, like 60 here?  And we get like maybe into the 60s.  Well, eventually it's going to be warm.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Are you promised?  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Thank you.  We love the WOW signs.  We love the homemade WOW signs. 
[00:50:00]  We really love the WOW bumper stickers.  What can I say?  We're all over.  And usually it's Wednesday that it happens.  There are ladies out there that will do this.  Do not harass the ladies.  Trust me, there's enough out there that will flash you if they see the WOW on the back of your car.  And also, it's great.  Summertime, going down to the shore here in the New York area.  We're out to the Humptons.  The Jersey Shore.  Or it works great when you're going to a concert and you're stuck in traffic and you have that WOW on the back of your car. 
[00:50:30]  There's a WOW sticker, Wendy.  Shut up, Bruce.  What's wrong with Jersey?  It's not so much Jersey.  It's Bruce.  What's wrong with Bruce?  I'm sick of him.  What's wrong with Bruce Juice?  I'm sick of him.  He finally allowed American Idol, I guess, a couple of weeks back, allowed them to use one of his songs.  Taylor Hicks song.  Taylor just kind of ripped it apart.  Dancing in the dark.  Even if we're just dancing in.  Because every song is just an awful tribute to Jersey. 
[00:51:00]  It's just a rambling, 15-minute long,  Well, I took my Chevy down to Jersey Shore.  It was me and Wendy in a tunnel of love.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wah.  All right, Bruce.  He's got some fine song.  You'll love Jersey, Bruce.  We get it.  There's a lot of rock stations out there that start your morning with some Bruce Juice.  Bruce Juice.  Bruce Juice.  I don't want my Bruce Juice. 
[00:51:30]  I'm allergic to it.  It makes me sick.  If your station gives you Bruce Juice in the morning, they have nothing.  They have nothing to give you.  I got a big record advance.  Did ya?  If your station gets the lead out for ya, they don't have a creative bone in their body.  How about My Hometown is a good song.  In my hometown.  In my hometown.  In my...  All right, it's your hometown.  Wah, wah, wah. 
[00:52:00]  When I pulled up to Asbury Park, it looked like Saigon.  You been there recently, Bruce?  Yeah.  How about you take your limo there and step out?  You'll be shot immediately.  Waxing fantastic about days gone by.  It's not the Stone Pony in 1968 anymore.  Well, I went to Asbury Park and, oh my God, Negroes.  Get back in the car and drive back to a better place in Jersey. 
[00:52:30]  Wah, wah, wah.  Bruce singing about 1969 Jersey Shore.  Stop.  What about the Steel Pier?  Singing about the diving horse?  You old bastard.  The diving horse.  Where the women walk around with parasols.  And the guys have striped bathing suits.  And big curly mustaches, Wendy.  And lift weights that are just bars with round balls of metal at the end. 
[00:53:00]  Wah, wah.  1909, he's singing about the last time Jersey Shore was relevant.  The good old days.  The good old days.  Jersey Shore is making a comeback.  You just can't go out at night and let it go.  Let me tell you who goes to the Jersey Shore.  College kids to get drunk and laid.  There isn't any, like, family entertainment like he's singing about.  They're trying to bring back the family entertainment.  Good luck.  They're trying.  Good luck.  I went for a swim and got hit with 50 hypodermic needles. 
[00:53:30]  Wah, wah.  That should be the Jersey State motto.  Jersey, get AIDS while you're making a sandcastle.  I think it is.  They're cleaning up the shore.  They really are.  Well, they're cleaning up the shore.  They're clean.  Wah, wah.  Shut up, Bruce.  Enough of him.  Oh, we got a do-gooder on the line.  Oh, no.  Oh, good.  Jay in Virginia Beach.  You're on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:54:00]  What's happening, guys?  Hi, Jay.  I'm a do-gooder.  I just want to comment on my old Hillary Clinton proposal.  Yeah.  Yes.  I drive a 10-cylinder Ford Excursion, and I've got about a 40-mile round.  10-cylinder.  Hold on.  Hold on, sir.  What was that music that just came up?  What was that?  What's that?  I heard some Bruce.  Whatever.  I think Bruce is fighting back.  Yeah.  All right.  Go ahead.  Anyway, I fill up my tank, and if I drive 55, which I piss a lot of people off,  but I get about six more days out of my tank if I do that. 
[00:54:30]  Dude, you drive 55?  Wait, six more days out of your tank?  I drive 55 to 60.  As opposed to?  Well, I'd rather get there faster and have to, you know, gas up a little more.  No, I leave about five, ten minutes early.  Why do you have a 10-cylinder car, then?  I don't know.  Bad idea.  Why not get a four-cylinder and drive at 80?  A 10-cylinder car?  Jay, you actually make sure you drive 55 so you can get an extra six days?  I have to. 
[00:55:00]  You're a goody two-shoes.  Why don't you do some carpooling, then?  Burn that fuel.  Keep the economy going.  What else do you do?  Not have sex till you're married?  No, no, no.  No, I do it for financial reasons.  Do you walk around like a little boy wearing, like, knickers and carrying an apple?  Why don't you just find a few driving buddies?  Carpool.  Oh, what a goody gumdrops.  That sounded just so faggy.  I bet he gives safety tips as he's driving. 
[00:55:30]  You're right.  With his seatbelt gun.  Quiet, you soccer mom.  10-2, 10-2.  That's right.  By the way, I'm calling a Razor, and I love it, man.  I had it since November.  Hey, do you do 10 miles, then pull over and take a safety break?  I like to take a safety break so I don't have an injury while I'm driving.  Every morning you wake up, I got to check the donut in the car.  I got to check the donut in the car.  I got to check the safe driver.  I hope you're driving and a plane engine falls through your roof. 
[00:56:00]  I hope you get hit with some blue ice from the sky.  Remember, every couple of hours, get out and just stretch your legs.  Right.  We're late for work, Jay.  Yeah, but safety breaks are important.  And as he's taking a safety break, he stretches too far, and he grabs his chest and falls faithfully  and cracks his teeth on a urinal and dies that way somewhere on the Jersey Parkway.  Here's the deal, Jay.  We are Americans.  We shouldn't have to drive 55.  We shouldn't have to carpool.  We shouldn't have to find driving buddies. 
[00:56:30]  Shouldn't have to race mix.  Well, that's true, too.  Might as well bring that in.  Bring it all in.  To the discussion.  The government should figure all this out for us.  I agree with you, man, but I'm saying it's financial.  It costs me about $120 to fill up.  It's just financial.  What do you drive?  No, it's great.  No, it's great.  I need a new car.  I know you do.  And I know the Escalades are dropping in price, and I can't wait to get my hands on a brand  new Escalade.  Let me tell you, Opie, the lap of luxury you will be driving in. 
[00:57:00]  It's an amazing vehicle.  Because I am a cheap F, and the prices are dropping on the Escalade.  Oh, you'll save money on the price of it, and you can put that towards gas.  Right.  What is it?  10-cylinder excursion?  Is that what you said?  Yes, sir.  Okay, that's a big car.  10-cylinder.  That's a lot of gas.  Why don't you just go all out and get the hybrid, Jay?  Get something that gets better mileage.  Go get the hybrid.  I've got four years left on this damn loan. 
[00:57:30]  Why don't you trade it in and gas up a DC-10 and drive that to work?  Who's going to buy this?  Who's going to buy a 10-cylinder excursion right now?  Exactly.  This guy's an idiot, not you, sir.  I just got to quickly address this idiot.  Hey, Ant, the war for oil was to make oil more expensive, not cheaper, man.  How does cheaper oil help the gas company?  By going to war, we shut down oil production in Iraq.  They're still producing less oil now than they were two weeks before the war.  Hey, idiot, there was an embargo.  No one was getting Iraqi oil. 
[00:58:00]  The only oil that was getting out of Iraq was the food for oil thing, and all that money  was going to their pals in the UN.  No, Iraq wasn't putting out oil.  You idiot.  The war for oil was to make it more expensive.  Yeah, man.  What a dope.  There's a couple great...  Jay, thanks.  Thanks, guys.  I appreciate it.  Have a good one.  First of all, Stephen from Bayshore, this ass has a 10-cylinder car and a one-cylinder brain.  Shut up, dope. 
[00:58:30]  And then Michelle from Jersey, I will take your drunken Billy Joel over that sucky Springsteen  any day.  He sucks.  We love our Billy Joel here on Long Island.  We're Long Islanders, and we got Billy Joel just getting drunk and driving into houses.  He visits people all the time.  One fan at a time.  Right through the wall of their houses.  The radio contest, the lucky winner has Billy drive through his living room and crash into  a crib in the kids' room.  What happened to him? 
[00:59:00]  Oh, God.  Now everyone's doing the math as far as 55 miles per hour.  Enough with your damn math.  I don't care as much about gas because I live in the Manhattan, so I have to fill up.  It's expensive, but it's so infrequently that I have to.  It doesn't really matter to me because it's only a few bucks every couple of weeks.  But if you had to drive and commute, man...  Someone's pointing out that that guy is driving a $60,000 car and he can't afford an extra  tank of gas.  And he's doing 50...  If I saw an excursion doing 55, I'd fire an RPG through the passenger side and kill 
[00:59:30]  him.  And I bet he's doing it in the left lane.  Of course he is.  I bet he's in the left lane with no one in front of him, a line of cars behind him, and  not nary taking a glance in the rearview mirror.  Got the old cruise control set.  Right, set at five, five, double nickels all the way, my friend.  Keep that music down.  I got to hear what's going on around me.  Ten o'clock, two o'clock.  Wondering why every car zipping past him in the middle lane is giving him a look of death.  Death.  And on the side he has the douche-mobile. 
[01:00:00]  A ten-cylinder douche-mobile.  Matt in Jersey, what's up?  Yes, guzzling zilts.  What's up?  The new 2007 douche-mobile.  Hold on, Matt.  Hold on.  Yes, Matt.  I just stepped on everyone.  I'm sorry.  Why should a whole line of cars have to suffer because this idiot made a poor consumer choice?  Yes.  How about this, sir?  You bit off more than you could chew.  Ooh.  That's a good one.  Stick with that.  You got it over your head.  What's up, Matt?  Make him up.  That guy.  I hope everyone noticed that.  That guy said he was from Virginia because I'll tell you what. 
[01:00:30]  Any moron who is dumb enough to try and be safe and drive the speed limit in Jersey, and believe me, everybody should.  But if you're dumb enough to try that in Jersey, you better have damn good life insurance or your funeral planned out before you try it.  Yeah.  Who the hell is on the Garden State Parkway or the New Jersey Turnpike doing 55 in Mel White?  Well, the only time you see that.  You're on a casket, I'll tell you that, because if you try that on the parkway, you're getting run over.  All right, Matt.  Thank you. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Peace.  I want to reiterate that.  You'll end up dead.  Cigars and scotch from Middletown.  A bottle of red, a bottle of white.  Isn't it a bottle of white, then a bottle of red, by the way?  He changes it.  It's a bottle of red, bottle of white at the beginning of the song.  Then at the end, it's a bottle of white, bottle of red.  All right.  So, Cigars and Scotch, Middletown.  A bottle of red, a bottle of white.  I'll use your den as a garage tonight.  Okay, that's funny.  Brenda and Eddie were still going steady until I killed them both with my car. 
[01:01:30]  You finally did something that rhymed.  Wow.  Did it?  No.  Well, not rhymed, but I mean, what with the actual music?  You always had so many extra words.  I really do.  Brenda and Eddie were still going steady until they got back from vacation and decided, all  right, we'll get it, Jim.  For a boast ass I am.  Well, drive through my house, you're the drunken ass.  And the steering wheel smelled like a beer. 
[01:02:00]  And I drink at the bar, then crash in my car.  And the homeowner says, man, what are you doing here?  And then my favorite part, la, la, la, la, la.  All right.  All right, we get it.  Enough of the la, la.  Oh, harm not.  How are you?  Show's moving really fast today.  Patricia O'Neill's going to join the program after the break.  I'm going to go to break.  I want to plug real quick because I have a show added.  I have to mention.  Show, go.  Plug.  Stretch Factor.  Do it.  I love you. 
[01:02:30]  This weekend, all four, Friday and Saturday, all shows are sold out.  Sunday will probably be sold out by today.  And I have a show added on Sunday.  10.30 show Sunday added.  7, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5.  Ha, ha.  For this Memorial Day weekend, the Stress Factor.  Very good.  With Jim Morton.  And details on Jimmy Day coming soon, Jimmy.  Coming soon.  But yesterday was my birthday. 
[01:03:00]  Yes.  And I had a very, very good day.  I really enjoyed my birthday yesterday.  Want to thank CBS for the fine gifts.  Nice, right?  Including tickets to see the Mets and the Phillies tomorrow.  Gifts, cake.  A day game.  It's just perfect.  And the cake, the whole staff came in.  It was terrific.  Do you like to be in the presents?  And I guess XM's birthday gift was lost in the mail or something.  So maybe we'll get it today.  Yeah.  It's on its way.  What were you saying, Jimmy?  No, I was just saying, I remember some kid, I just, I'm glad you actually, because it was an awful line. 
[01:03:30]  Uh-oh.  As I said it, I got the douche chill as I was saying it.  Oh, that's never good.  What was it?  I'd rather not.  Could you please?  Just for us.  I remember this kid, Jeff, said in high school, I like to be in the presence of presents.  And I just kind of said that.  Okay.  As I said that, I began to smell like vinegar and a nozzle grew out of my head.  You know what?  If we don't take a break, we're going to get just way behind. 
[01:04:00]  Take a break.  Take a break, sweetie.  So the Stalker Patty thing.  Time out.  Could someone remind me?  We got to play the Stalker Patty right after break.  Basically, it's Stalker Patty, a regular on our program.  She's a true Stalker of this program.  That's how we met many, many years ago.  51-year-old virgin.  Who's now going through menopause.  She showed up for her gift giving that she does when it's our birthdays or if it's a holiday.  She showed up at XM yesterday for the second half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Old malted milk ball ovaries. 
[01:04:30]  And we got audio of her screaming for her life.  As we sang, happy birthday to me.  If you put her ovaries on your sweater, Mars will stay away from me.  So when we get back, we'll finally play the audio.  Don't go anywhere.  Don't change the dial because this is worth listening to.  Don't go try listening to Preston and Steve.  Nothing's going on there.  Where are you going? 
[01:05:00]  Nothing is going on on that program.  Everyone knows it.  We're back finally in Philly.  And we're taking over.  Hi, Philly.  Big hi to everyone listening to us on WYSP.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Prepare to be wowed.  What?  Knockers.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Okay, okay, fine.  Wow.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  Great.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Got to get right into it.  Patrice O'Neill in studio. 
[01:05:30]  Patrice playing Caroline's here in New York City all weekend long.  What's the phone number for tickets for Caroline's?  Go ahead.  212-757-4100.  Are you doing it tomorrow night through Sunday?  Yeah, Thursday through Sunday.  Memorial Day in New York will probably sell out.  So call for tickets so you don't have to bellyache that you miss the shows.  I can't wait to see Patrice.  Patrice is very, very funny on stage, man.  Love watching his show.  And do us a favor, go see Patrice O'Neill because Anthony and I called in so many favors 
[01:06:00]  to Greg Charles when Brian Regan was in town.  Oh, my God.  Table for 18, please.  It's not like Brian really sells a lot.  It's not like you're giving up any real money.  Saturday 8 o'clock show.  That one never goes clean.  Yeah.  Greg Charles doesn't know how to say no, man, because I called him last minute.  Greg, I need a table for 6.  Friday, 10.30 show.  I love that guy.  He never says no, gentlemen.  The guy has never said no.  I have a red, mature, audience's only stamp on the front of my post. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, dear.  Mature.  Greg is the best.  He takes, and talk about, you know, taking care of us.  Oh, my God.  The guy completely hooks us up.  Unbelievable.  And then I wind up looking like a good guy because then I'll tip the waitstaff.  Like the second the waitress comes over and goes, you want something?  I pull out a C note because I know that would have been like spent,  just getting in to see the shows.  I give him a C note, and I go, you just keep coming back, 
[01:07:00]  make sure the table's taken care of.  Well, you know they have 100 employees that split.  Do they?  So I gave her a buck.  You gave her a buck.  I stink.  Why don't you just hand her two penny rolls?  You know, she must have loved that dollar because she was back every second.  Can I help you, Mr. Cumia?  Unless she put it in a sock.  She probably did.  Don't flash that around.  Don't give it to me yet.  You got to think if you're splitting tips and someone every once in a while you get that  hundred dollar bill or something, you're throwing it in your sock. 
[01:07:30]  It's going in the garter.  You're throwing a ten in the old.  They're all calling him Anthony the Jew in the back.  Yeah.  That cheap bastard look.  Ten bucks.  Hold it like a wet baby.  Looking at it, laughing at it.  Bastard staff.  Think of a dead rat by the tail.  Thumb and pointer finger.  This is what he left.  Cheapo.  When I was growing up, I was a caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club.  And, you know, coming from a large family, we didn't have a lot of money.  So the money I made at the country club would have to go to the family for food and all this 
[01:08:00]  crap, right?  And I learned early on, stuff the sock.  Yes.  Stuff the sock.  Mom, it was a slow day, man.  I only did one loop.  Here's $20.  Meanwhile, I went out with the mafia guys.  Your life is the beginning of Caddyshack.  Put it in there.  I saw another five.  Dude, that's why that movie's so great to me.  I lived that life.  And, you know, they didn't know that I had...  What kid is this?  They didn't know I had the mafia, you know, guys that day, and they were giving me a $100 
[01:08:30]  tip because I read the putt right on 18.  Who's calls for the old Billy Boone?  I'm coming home going, ah, Mom, $20 today.  It was a slow day.  And my sock is bulging.  Nobody likes a tattletale, so of course me.  And then I...  You told a heartwarming white guy tip-stealing story.  Time to go to work, Hope.  You get the big bag.  And then I cut a hole in my room in the wallpaper, and I was stuffing the wall with my cash. 
[01:09:00]  Hey, Opie, when are you back in Boys Town, all right?  Even then, Opie.  What?  Even then, you was a skinflint.  I wasn't a skinflint.  I was buying groceries for my family when I was 14 years old.  I had to keep a little for myself, Patrice.  The way Caddyshack is like your life, my life was kind of like Caddyshack 2.  A disaster that no one cared about.  That no one went to see.  No one went to see. 
[01:09:30]  It raked in $4.800 at the box office.  $4.800.  Oh, that Marshall Warfield was a hoot, though.  But it's funny with that, you know, hiding the money.  I did that growing up.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I never had money.  Because I kind of had to empty my pockets when I came in.  The front door, I'm like, oh, man, I waited three hours just to get out.  I made $20.  Here it is.  Slow day.  Although my dad did take a percentage when I was, and I had to be 13 years old, and I  was washing dishes at some place called the El Adobe Restaurant in San Juan Capistrano. 
[01:10:00]  And President Nixon used to come and eat there, and they used to bring out the presidential  seal plates, and I'd have to wash them.  Felt honored.  And I'd have to give, like, I'd have to give 20% of my pay to my father for, like, room  and board.  I was 13.  I wish I had a dad around to teach me those goofy lessons.  Oh, it was a...  Percentages of my kids.  Goofy lessons.  Meanwhile, he was unemployed, and I'd get off of school and walk to the stable where 
[01:10:30]  we kept our horses, and him and Chato Reyes, a Mexican guy, and his brother Juan Reyes,  would be sitting around with tall boy buds, and my dad going, you learn anything in school  today?  Like, and then I'd have to get done and go to work and give 20% to the house.  Yeah.  Here's the hardest lesson I ever learned about money ever from my mom.  She's probably listening, and she hates when I tell this story.  But I had a car accident and got about 10 Gs when I was about, like, 15, 16. 
[01:11:00]  Gave my mother four Gs.  Now, as an adult now, four Gs to you might...  Somebody says, hey, I got four Gs.  You might go, ah, get out of my face.  But as a kid, I gave my mother four Gs.  A lot of money.  Four Gs to a kid is incomprehensible.  And then...  To a kid.  So she bought, like, a bunch of stuff, and I said...  She's, like, complaining about money.  I said, I just gave you four Gs.  She goes, man, F that punk-ass $4,000.  It hurt me to this day. 
[01:11:30]  She called my $4,000 out of my cut face and my busted-up nose and my knocked-out teeth.  That's $4 million to a kid.  That punk-ass $4,000.  I was like, to this day, it hurt my feelings.  Well, how do you think she feels?  That's a week's worth of lunches.  Speaking of that, people are talking about Patrice's show this weekend to Caroline's,  saying they're wondering if this time the chains are going to be strong enough and the city  won't be destroyed. 
[01:12:00]  Bastards.  All right, listen.  We got to play the Stalker Patty thing.  And, of course, that came from Bayshore, Long Island.  Yeah.  Racist.  I read it.  We celebrated my birthday yesterday, Patrice.  Happy birthday.  And you know Stalker Patty, right?  Yeah.  What happened to her?  What y'all do bad to Patty?  Oh, boy.  Well...  Anything bad to her is fun to us.  Well, Stalker Patty came in to give some gifts for my birthday.  Awful gifts.  Actually, I didn't mind the gifts because I'm drinking coffee and she works at Starbucks, 
[01:12:30]  so she got me some Starbucks.  That's some coffee.  And the coupons, which you ripped up in her face.  Yeah, the coupons for Frappuccinos.  And I'm like, I don't drink Frappuccinos.  Rip, rip, rip.  Yeah.  And then we decided to make her cry again.  We've shaved her head twice.  Yep.  And as she's in studio yesterday, this was late in the show, we noticed that her hair  just looked absolutely awful.  Yeah, it's very dry.  Her hair is like straw. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  And we were thinking maybe it's time to just shave her head and give her some new, let it  grow out into some new fresh hair.  And she definitely doesn't want to go through that again.  Like we said, we did it twice before so she could win tickets or for money or something.  She was destitute.  So we shaved it.  And let me tell you what she looks like with a shaved head.  I swear to God, when the allies liberated Auschwitz, they didn't see people that looked as bad  as Patty looks with a shaved head. 
[01:13:30]  And she looked like the pianist.  She is the definitive concentration camp.  Like any time they want to do a movie about the concentration camp, they should call her  up.  She can make a fortune.  Just shave the head.  So she doesn't want to do that again.  So for my birthday, I figured I wanted a real present.  I wanted, you know, Stalker Patti to have a shaved head again.  And we got clippers in the studio.  Yeah.  So Danny was rummaging around. 
[01:14:00]  He found the clippers, plugged them in.  And we had a mic right near her.  And Club Soda Kenny was holding the door shut.  And there's no way she's getting past that animal.  And she's trying to open the door.  She turns around.  Danny's coming at her with the clippers.  You hear the clipper noise.  And she loses her mind.  I swear to you, it's like a murder scene.  This is very disturbing because as she's losing her mind and screaming, they're singing happy  birthday to me.  It's like one of those scenes out of a movie where it's not just one killer. 
[01:14:30]  Like it's the whole family is nuts.  And you're sitting around and you're getting murdered.  And the family is doing something ridiculous.  And others are laughing.  And one is playing with a doll.  And this one's just cooking.  Like that's what the scene was.  Remember the scene in Rosemary's Baby where you're expecting help?  And they're all going, Satan is his father.  Right, yeah.  And we're all in on it.  Wait a minute.  They're all in on it.  She got no sympathy in there.  She's screaming for her life.  And we're all singing and laughing. 
[01:15:00]  With that said, here's the audio from yesterday.  Check it out.  We've got to shave your head again, I think.  No.  And you start over.  Yeah, Patty.  No.  Yeah.  You know, when we shaved.  Grab her.  Grab her.  When we shaved your head, you had a much better attitude.  Yeah, close the door, Kenny.  Yeah, close the clippers out.  Yeah, close the door, get the clippers.  No.  Yeah.  No.  Time to shave your head.  No, I don't want that.  That's all right.  You'll get used to it.  It's my birthday gift.  There's the wig. 
[01:15:30]  It's my birthday gift.  Get used to it.  Oh, boy.  Patty.  Yeah, Patty's going to.  Yeah, we also got to bring up the wig was acknowledged there.  She wound up buying a wig or somebody gave her a wig while her head was shaved so she  could go out into society.  And it is the worst wig you'd ever want to shave.  She would have looked more dignified if she just carried a mop and put it over her head.  I think it's what it was.  Wait a minute.  So bald, she didn't look like Sinead O'Connor like that look?  Oh, no.  No. 
[01:16:00]  She got over with it?  No.  No.  It was no protest look to her.  She should be.  She looked like Sinead.  Yeah.  Oh, yikes.  It was either, yeah, concentration camp, cancer, or brain surgery.  Nothing dignified.  Nothing hot.  Nothing exact.  You ever see sometimes a woman can shave her head and look and she's got a very pretty  face and body and you go like, wow, how the hell does a girl pull off the shaved head  look?  Yeah.  The opposite end of that spectrum is Patty. 
[01:16:30]  Horrid.  It just looks.  Oh, my goodness.  So we'll get back to the audio here.  I'm going to acknowledge this is deeply disturbing.  I don't want your hate email and your hate phone calls.  Please remove the children from the room.  You may want to turn the dial and get the lead out somewhere.  This disturbs you.  Here it is.  Patty's going to open the door.  I don't want my head shaved.  Here it comes.  It's my birthday gift.  It's Obie's birthday gift to himself.  I was coming in.  No.  Fire it up. 
[01:17:00]  You hear that, Patty?  No.  We got a wig for you.  I don't want that.  No.  Can we get a mic over there?  No.  Get a mic over there.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Here it comes, Patty.  No.  No.  No.  I don't want that.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  I don't want that.  No.  But we do.  No, I don't. 
[01:17:30]  It's my birthday gift.  It's my birthday gift.  This one's a wig.  You'll look pretty in the wig.  I don't want that.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  No.  Happy birthday, dear old me.  Happy birthday to you.  No. 
[01:18:00]  Stop thinking of yourself, Patty.  Think about it.  You're a selfish bitch.  Your whole life is one act of you, you, you.  No.  Were you undoing the wig here and everything?  She's out of reach because you didn't undo the cord.  I know.  Undo the cord there, Danny.  There we go.  Happy birthday to you.  No.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear old me.  No. 
[01:18:30]  Happy birthday to you.  Take the hair.  No.  No.  No.  She's crying.  No.  No.  No.  She's just weeping.  And why do we bully Patty?  Because we're tough guys.  You notice we don't try to shave Patrice's head?  No.  Brother.  Anyone else comes in here?  Because it'll be one.  It'll be one.  Steve.  Nah, shut up.  Club Soda Kenny. 
[01:19:00]  All right, man.  Relax.  Shave Patrice's head.  Nah, nah.  All right, man.  Punch of faggots.  We pick on old ladies.  And unfortunately, we don't have the rest of the audio.  We had to stop because she started screaming that she was having an asthma attack.  An asthma attack.  She's like a little Yorkshire terrier.  Just out of breath.  And I know, but whenever she's going, no, no, it just makes me hate her.  Yeah, I know.  Why is that?  Because it's disingenuous.  She's a masochist, man.  When she did the mousetraps on the ground, it's like this, oh my, every time she found 
[01:19:30]  where the pain was.  Yeah.  She's a masochist.  Yeah, there's something weird going on there.  I just can't control the laughter.  I was laughing through the entire thing at her horror.  Her sheer terror on her face, the screams, the crying just made me laugh.  And that's the type of audio you hear, like, once the show is eventually fired again, that's  what you're like, happy bro.  This is the kind of radio show they were doing. 
[01:20:00]  You know what?  Norton can't even enjoy stuff like this no more.  Enough.  Because he's like going, oh man, are we going to get fired?  Dude, everything we do now, we think, how is this going to look when we're fired?  Like everything we do, on video, on audio, we think, all right, how are they going to  use this when we're fired?  I think what we should do, can we post this audio on our website and then have people remix  it?  Yeah.  Because already people are saying, you know, well, Steve wrote down that we need to add  chainsaw sound effects to it.  I think Drew could do a great job with it, mixing it into a song. 
[01:20:30]  But yeah, the listeners, get some chainsaw, maybe some audio of leather face grunting, things  like that would be hysterical.  You know what kind of contest I can, because Patrice is right, I can't.  Like my idea of fun in the studio now is we're having some people in to play jacks.  Look at how, see who can roll that marble the farthest.  They're getting fired no more.  That's why, that's why it's like when y'all came to the free FM, I'm like, people are like, 
[01:21:00]  hey, when are you going to go on?  I said, I don't know, man, when they have, I don't know.  I'm not in a big rush because I got to sit here and figure out how to say doo-doo and  Hey man, let me tell you something, you can kiss my, oh, the things that make sperm come  out and the.  My bum.  My bum, my.  Kiss my earlobe, sucker.  Kiss my fanny.  Let's go to the phone, Sheridan.  Let me call faces when I said sperm.  Yeah, it's like, ah, no.  I can't say that. 
[01:21:30]  Ah, maybe, who knows, we'll find out later when we do the dump report.  Oh God.  Sheridan in Florida, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, listen, I'm a police officer here in Florida and what you're doing right now, don't worry  about getting fired.  Worry about going to prison.  Really?  Yeah, there's a crime in Florida called false imprisonment.  Well, we don't live in Florida.  That's right, fella.  First of all, it was real imprisonment, idiot.  She was not allowed to leave.  Yeah. 
[01:22:00]  Until we got the proper screams out of her for our radio show.  Look, guys, did you hear what he just said?  He said he's going to try to turn this into a nigga get arrested.  A crime.  Right.  You guys essentially captured her yesterday, but he goes, now Patrice is there laughing  with you now.  Yeah.  There's a crime in Florida called a nigga within three feet.  Ass.  Bring it to me.  I'm an innocent bystander.  This was yesterday.  Well, there's a crime called nigga was in the past.  He wasn't there, but he's here today.  Listen to it.  Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Jerk. 
[01:22:30]  The only thing missing from that audio was Opie singing, singing in the rain while beating  up her elderly husband.  Yeah.  Putting a ball in his mouth.  Very well, little brother.  Very well.  And a giant statue of a thing.  Yes.  My wife had her hair cut off in a terrible clipping incident on the radio.  See?  The doctors told me it was the barbershop, but I knew what it was.  Victim of the modern age.  You poor, poor girl.  Let's cut here, me droogies. 
[01:23:00]  What a great movie that was.  Oh, yeah.  It was quite a sight to behold with me Gullivers.  What's up?  They're showing the old picture of Patty.  Who is she with?  We put the same outfit on Patty.  Oh, right.  And the other girl, the same sexy outfit on both of them.  Some whore that came in.  Patty actually looks.  It's supposed to be a sexy outfit.  It's all lace, and you could see a thong through it.  And the front has two openings where her cleavage should be, and it's her with a bald-shaped 
[01:23:30]  head.  I swear, this looks like something if you went into a time machine three billion years in  the future.  This is what our society would look like.  It's the Star Trek hiney-headed alien.  She looks like Patrick Stewart.  Patrick Stewart.  No, she looks like Matthew Modine from Full Metal Jacket.  You get everyone in trouble, Leonard.  Show me your war face.  What idiot working for this show circled Patty like we wouldn't know which one to look at. 
[01:24:00]  We have a paper.  Patty is circled like we might go, which one is Patty?  Oh, that is just...  We did it one time.  We did it once in the studio and once on the pitcher's mound.  Yeah.  During our softball game.  Hey, are we doing the celebrity softball game this year?  Getting a lot of requests for it.  A lot of people are saying we ought to do the softball game again.  Yeah, we did it at Newark Bears Stadium.  I don't think they'll have us back.  In Newark.  And those softball games, it was softball games slash riot. 
[01:24:30]  Okay, we're looking for a place to have our celebrity softball game.  Just plugged it very well for a place to have that we're looking.  6,000.  By riot, I mean a scream.  Fun.  We need a place that holds 6,000 shrunks.  They will drink a lot of beer, so your beer sales will be ridiculous.  Girls will be flashing.  Girls will be almost completely nude.  There could be some sexual assaults.  And there may be some softball that is played.  All the chairs that are pulled out is going to weigh in with the beer.  It's going to be even. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, the money you'll get...  The money you're going to make.  The blood money.  If you're willing to accept blood money.  The rape and the broken bleaches.  You're looking for this show.  You're picking clumps of hair out of the seat backs for weeks.  And so will the police.  I'm still looking at Patty.  How do you have wrinkled collarbones?  I know.  That's the tightest spot on a human.  Hey, we got to go to Dallas.  Frank.  Frank, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, how's it going, man?  Hiya, Frank.  What's up?  Yeah, man. 
[01:25:30]  I just wanted to say it sounds like a damn Duke lacrosse party going on over there, man.  It's talking Patty, man.  Yeah, she was screaming real good.  Let's say hi to Bruce the Trucker.  Bruce, what's up?  Hey, man.  I just wanted to say that audio Patty there.  Man, she reminds me of the birthday scene from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Yep, that too.  Kind of reminds me of probably the sleeper section of your truck at night, too.  A bunch of serial killers on wheels.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:26:00]  Bunch of BTKs.  Punch it out, guys.  All right, Bruce.  We were going to ask you what you were calling, but...  Punching out the girl that's in his cab.  I just needed a lift, mister.  Hey, mister.  Going my way?  That is a creepy world.  Hop in.  Nothing you want to see less than that door open, the passenger door of the big rig, and the guy going, hop in, sweetheart.  And then that place where they sleep.  Like, they have a compartment.  Yeah, the sleeper cab right behind.  It's a creepy world.  Oh, truck is.  And you're just able to pull everything out and hose it down. 
[01:26:30]  Oh.  There's a drain in the floor.  It's a truck with a coffin in it.  Hey, good buddy.  How you doing?  I just drove down, broke my neck, broke face, don't bend, flush down the toilet.  What you doing?  What?  What you doing?  What?  What you hauling, big...  Hey, breaker, breaker, one nine.  Breaker, breaker, one nine.  You want to find this hooker.  I've done left her on the side of nine to five.  Mile marker, 617.  You want to pick her up?  Don't know if you're going to be able to identify her. 
[01:27:00]  Even through the dental records, I got the piece of the necklace out of them.  What you hauling, good buddy?  Oh, drains for shower stalls.  Everybody needs them.  You know, if I weren't for a trucker, you guys wouldn't get nothing.  By the way, the body, a drain of all of blood.  I drank it.  I love you, truckers.  There's a good hooker.  You can pick her up.  Mile marker, 617 through 625.  He's in a rest stop, like, oh, excuse me, please, can you help me move this couch? 
[01:27:30]  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  She pulls up all innocent.  American girl.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my.  Make it easy, baby.  She's singing.  Hey, you look like you're giving some help.  Would you?  Would you?  Would you?  Just get in the van.  You get inside.  I'll help you.  Get inside.  I'll be in my arm.  You need me to help you put the little account in the AT wheel? 
[01:28:00]  And you could, that whole scene, I've watched it.  I actually have it up on my MySpace account because it's such a great scene that I put it up there.  And you could tell, like, she's walking in, she looks, and as a lot of women that have been through, like, horrible things know,  there's some intuition that she puts across very well on the screen that she shouldn't, she should just go inside.  But she turns and is like, hey, you need help with that?  And it's like, oh, no. 
[01:28:30]  Would you?  Would you?  Are you moving?  Do you need help moving on a couch at 5 in the morning and I've never seen you before?  With his broken arm and he's really acting.  He's playing it up.  He tried to get it in once and failed.  You look a little handicapped.  You need a hand.  Or did it?  Yeah.  Get in the van, idiot.  I'm going to punch you right in the face.  How did you get in that far?  He never asked how he got it to where it's out on the shoulder of the room.  It's 7 a.m.  And he's trying to, he has a broken wrist and he's pushing a couch. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  You mind?  Was she a great big fat person?  What did you do?  Well, Mrs. Lippman used to, I think I got a card.  You want to come inside?  I got a card.  And then he holds that guy.  He holds the credit cards and he spins.  When she's on to him and he runs into the other room, the cards fall out of his hand. 
[01:29:30]  He's just like, oh.  He runs away.  Best character in a movie ever.  Not best, but definitely up there.  It's way up there.  Definitely up there.  All right.  When he answers up, oh, yeah.  Was she a great big fat person?  Yeah.  She was a big girl.  Because I cut him back cheeks to you.  I could make a hat and a dress.  Love him.  All right.  They're peeking in from the other room. 
[01:30:00]  Why don't we take a break?  We take a break.  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  He's playing Carolines here in New York City all weekend long.  You got to go see Patrice O'Neal if you're in town.  212-757-4100 for tickets for Patrice O'Neal.  Patrice, you ever do news teasers with us?  I don't remember.  Yeah, of course.  You've done the – okay.  We have a whole new batch of news teasers.  We'll get into that next.  Also, we got to take a peek at House.  Some funny things happening.  House.  House.  And other things.  Stay there.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:30:30]  I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  ONA, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Mornings with Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM 202. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, we're doing the hang with Patrice O'Neal today.  He's playing Carolines all weekend long here in New York City.  212-757-4100 starting tomorrow night through Sunday.  We should get right into news teasers, huh?  Love the news teasers.  We started this yesterday and ran out of time.  We seem to run out of time a lot on this program.  Yeah.  More time here. 
[01:31:30]  Let's do more time here.  Where they give us birthday cakes and presents.  Not one phone call from XM yesterday.  We should be a happy birthday.  Yes, I am keeping track at this point.  Are you kidding?  Not one phone call.  Hilo is usually very good with that stuff.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on with Hilo.  He's probably just caught up with a whole bunch of stuff.  He's a very nurturing, retarded-haired man.  He's a good egg, Hilo.  I've got to call him and see what's going on. 
[01:32:00]  I hope he's taking helicopter rides.  I'm fielding business phone calls.  What the hell happened in our careers?  Have fun.  I did it for 10 years.  Where we spun around.  I did it for 10 years.  Have fun.  You've got nine years to go.  Ten years.  At least.  At two of those years, we did nothing.  Right.  I was still taking phone calls.  So was I.  I was hoping.  Any job?  No.  Okay.  Bye.  How many of those awful calls did we get?  Talk to Bob.  Really?  What happened?  What did he say?  What did he say?  Well, it sounds promising. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, he's got nothing.  Hey, let's get into the news teases.  We can talk about that some other day.  Yeah.  That's an easy thing to talk about when we have nothing.  Yeah.  That's one of those things where you talk about when we have nothing else to talk about.  So here's what we're saying.  You'll be hearing about this tomorrow.  Right.  When Patrice O'Neill's not here.  All right.  So it's news teases.  We started the new batch yesterday.  The scary news teases on the local news.  Very frightening.  A lot of people are picking up on this, too.  You see a lot of the shows, Daily Show and everything.  They're starting a parody.  The frightening news tease. 
[01:33:00]  You see it on the news around your town.  You're watching a TV show.  They butt in with their little promo for the news.  And it's something so horrific and scary.  But they don't give you enough information to let you know if you should continue being scared or you're out of danger.  Right.  Something might be killing your children that they're playing with right now.  We'll tell you about it later.  But he's playing with something. 
[01:33:30]  If that's it and he dies, I could have taken it away.  By the way, where's Danny?  Danny.  What?  Oh, no.  Oh.  Yeah, he's the guy that usually fills us in on what the tease was.  Well, could he call?  We could have him on the phone because he gives us the answers.  We try to give you the answers to these scary news teases.  When he knows them, sometimes they don't send him the answers.  Right.  Because we're asking the rest of America to send in the scary news teases, the fear news teases from your local news program. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  Let's get to one.  All right.  Here's the first.  Tonight at 11, a Channel 3 I-Team investigation takes you to the streets and uncovers a new set of rules that protects killers.  Now here's Scott with the forecast.  Scott?  Oh, and then just right to the forecast.  These dummies don't even know what they're reading anymore.  The forecast?  Killers on the streets, you idiot.  They don't even said it.  They don't even know what they're reading anymore. 
[01:34:30]  No.  It's just to them, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  There's nothing there.  Killers on the streets.  Listen to her delivery.  So casual.  Tonight at 11, a Channel 3 I-Team investigation takes you to the streets and uncovers a new set of rules that protects killers.  Now here's Scott with the forecast.  Scott?  Now here.  Not.  She didn't skip a beat.  What's the set of rules?  Yeah.  What are the rules that are protecting killers? 
[01:35:00]  And you know the killers isn't murderers.  They just say that because they're disingenuous scumbags.  It's got to be something about a traffic light that falls, which is a killer.  It's some stupid thing.  Oh, you think like the figurative killer.  Yeah, the killer.  No.  Like the bird flu.  Because she said protect killers.  Protect killers.  You know, what's she going to say?  You know, stop lights will fall on people, but we're trying to protect them.  Yeah, but to protect a killer, there's some kind of wordplay there because they would say- 
[01:35:30]  Of course there is.  Of course there is.  Because no one's for protecting killers.  Where's Danny?  Danny's on the phone here.  This fountain of idiocy.  Hey, Danny.  Hi, honey bears.  Do you know what the answer is?  No, unfortunately not for this one.  Damn it.  Why?  Why don't you tell everyone why, Danny?  Because the listeners are poo-poo faces.  Where was it from with their I-Team 3?  Yeah, I mean, you know, some tiny town in the middle of nowhere.  Way to help out.  What are you doing today besides filling out a resume?  Running your show, Jimmy. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, good one.  That's not Danny's fault.  Well, we've told the listeners, if you send in the scary news teases to Danny at foundrymusic.com,  you've got to send the answers.  Let us know what the-  They are getting better, though.  They are getting much, much better with that.  All right.  Who needs to know anyway?  Screw it.  Let's get to the next one.  Please call it.  They're protecting killers.  I want to know.  Good for them.  Tonight at 10 on ABC 15 News, a consumer alert everyone needs to see.  We all worry about protecting our kids and keeping them safe.  We childproof our homes. 
[01:36:30]  We make them wear bike helmets and seatbelts.  But chances are there's something in your home that's a danger to your kids.  Tell us!  I did not even think about it.  This story really surprised us.  Tonight on ABC 15 News at 10.  It's right there in your house, people.  You have the answer in front of you.  All that lead-up time that he wastes listing things that you do.  How about cutting that crap out, we know we do it,  and just saying this is bad for your kids?  Yeah.  So do you think if they told you that now they wouldn't watch them like he goes, 
[01:37:00]  if he said, oh, something's going to crawl up their nose and kill them,  it's giant fleas.  Now, if you go, okay, giant fleas, you'll still stay.  Right.  And you'll watch later.  They hear the whole thing, what these fleas are going to do to you.  They can't at least tell you so they'll give you a chance to save your kids.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  I think you're either going to watch the news or you're not going to watch the news.  They shouldn't be allowed to call it the news anymore, by the way.  Right.  They shouldn't be allowed to do this.  It's an entertainment program.  And call it the news.  This is my problem with these scumbag teasers, 
[01:37:30]  is that they have carte blanche to show anything they want,  to cover any content,  and because they're the news media,  they are allowed to do anything they want,  and yet they still tease it like any other show.  They're going to behave like other shows.  They should have to face the same regulations as other shows,  and they don't.  Yeah.  That's no different than,  how will Laverne and Shirley get out of this problem?  It's the same stupid sitcom tease,  tease where they don't give you the answer. 
[01:38:00]  Scary movie music.  The Fonz has two dates.  How is he going to pull off?  What?  You're teasing it like a dopey sitcom.  Will Benson sleep with Richard Mulligan?  Tune in to see.  It's like the Batman thing.  Oh, will your child swallow something and die?  Tune in to the news.  Same news time, same news channel.  Terrible turnip events. 
[01:38:30]  Chickens that will choke you.  Time for the answer.  Danny?  It actually could be your TV stand.  Your TV what?  Your TV stand.  Oh, the TV stand.  That's an old story.  How many kids have pulled those things on top of themselves?  That's called thinning the herd.  Right.  We need a few of those to happen every once in a while.  Ooh, pretty close.  I think Poe's going to do that with the big screen over here one day.  He's just going to go to touch something and it's going to fall on him.  He stands three inches away from it and looks at it with his head. 
[01:39:00]  And looks at it.  All he can see is three pixels.  The danger is.  So close.  The danger is the kids crawl up to the TV,  try to stand up and hold themselves on the TV stand.  Yeah, they want to.  Pulling the TV stand and the huge TV on top of that.  They want to climb up and touch SpongeBob or someone.  And it winds up toppling down on them.  And the last thing they see is little SpongeBob going,  you stupid kid.  No, they don't.  Because the plug is pulled out.  So they go, where's SpongeBob?  Head crushed.  Where's SpongeBob? 
[01:39:30]  I'm getting cold and it's getting dark.  How great is that news tease, though?  Same, mommy.  How great is that news tease, though?  They're talking about the TV stands.  Yeah.  It's on TV.  And they're not telling you as the kid is starting to crawl toward the TV.  As they're, like, putting colorful little toys on the screen.  Look, kids.  All right, let's move on.  The last thing your child sees could be my face headed towards him.  Right.  Here's the next news tease. 
[01:40:00]  Scary news tease.  Very scary.  Plus, is your family cat a health hazard for your children?  Look in the back.  The family cat.  It's always the children.  You're not even safe from your own cat.  They've been using the kids to scare the parents into watching the news.  Because a lot of people hear about a danger, and it's you, it's your car, it's something.  You don't care.  You don't care.  But it's like, I'll get around it.  It's like, I don't know how many, you know, recall notices over the years for various vehicles 
[01:40:30]  I've gotten.  I've never taken a car in for a recall.  It's like, what's going on?  Are my wheels going to fly off?  Shut up.  It's missing a pin.  A pin that has been known to come loose in some circumstances that will make it hard  to steer to the, I could live with it.  Right.  Well, I used to drive cars where the wheels did fall off.  You know what it's going to take?  Opening up your newspaper and just seeing hundreds of crashes that involved the exact  make and model of your car.  Yeah, that's my car.  Oh my God.  10,000 dead in one day.  Right. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  I'll stay home today.  I'll call car service.  Would anything positive sell the news?  It was like, what if they just reported, hey, you know, E. coli has been cured.  It was sunny today and people loved it.  Canada does that crap.  And no one wants to hear it.  And no one wants to watch it.  We're a nation that loves, like, horrible things.  If horrible, if enough horrible things don't happen within a set amount of time, we get,  like, frustrated at it.  And the way the news teases things, the Fox News alert, it's meant to get your adrenaline 
[01:41:30]  pumped up.  Strong.  And you go like, what the hell?  What the hell?  Fox News alert.  This just in.  And at first.  Everyone is ticklish.  Yeah.  That's exactly it.  And that's what they do.  Doctors have found that everyone is ticklish.  This Fox News alert just in.  Fudge shortage.  If you're going out for ice cream, you might not get fudge.  The Fox News alert stinks.  It used to mean something. 
[01:42:00]  They leave the insignia across the screen, and it blocks the video half the time.  During a car chase, they'll leave that stupid Fox or ABC or CBS logo.  The logo, right.  Which blocks half the video.  That's how important the news is.  They have to block it by letting you know.  We're the ones who are showing it to you.  But, yeah, what station is showing it to you?  It's not the exact Azar Kelly beheading, but we're the ones who are featuring it first.  You know, you're on to something.  I've been watching the NBA playoffs, and the advertisements that pop on the screen, it 
[01:42:30]  used to be a little graphic.  Oh, yeah.  And now it's graphics that move and stuff.  Fox is the worst for it, yeah.  But now it's like moving graphics.  Yeah.  As you're trying to watch a basketball game, you're like, ah, what was that?  Because you see, like, a face coming at you doing some wacky thing in the left-hand corner.  Anything you watch, and I turn on, like, I'm watching Seinfeld or something, and all  of a sudden, sound effects, a NASCAR comes pulling on.  Right.  It's like doing donuts in the screen.  I'm trying to watch a show. 
[01:43:00]  It's trying to get your attention, obviously.  Well, it got it.  It's so annoying.  Somebody figured it out, though, because, like, even on, like, USA or these networks,  it's like, now, when I watch stuff on, like, movies on regular TV, I want to read the damn  cast list.  I want to read the credits.  Oh, you don't anymore.  They cut it in half, and my eyes ain't as good, you know, so they chop it in half.  They squeeze it, and they squeeze it.  To half screen, or sometimes quarter screen, run through it at 8 million miles an hour.  It goes fast. 
[01:43:30]  Wait a minute.  There's some poor key grip going, my name, I was waiting for this whole movie just to  see my name.  The rest of the moment, Steve Ho Ho, wait, I want to know, wait, oh.  That's how kids are killed at the TV stand.  They get closer to try to read the credits.  Right.  Hey, Danny, what's the answer to the cat could be a health hazard?  Well, you're going to love this one.  They tell you not to let your cat sleep in the same room as your baby or toddler.  Oh, because they can get on the chest, and they breathe the life essence out of the child.  I've seen this in a Stephen King movie. 
[01:44:00]  Well, actually, it's kind of funny, because you're close, because the cat could actually  just decide to go to sleep on your child's face.  Oh, there's a happy find.  If that, yeah, your cat is snug as a bug in a rug, and a little blue lump under it, with  just, wait a minute, so the uncomfortable little chilly feet, stiff to the touch, and a nice  warm kitty purring away on his face.  And that purr is all you hear on your walkie-talkie baby thing. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, seems like everything's okay in the other room.  Shooting his purring.  I can't believe he slept through the night, and the day, and the night again.  Wait a minute.  All right.  Well, that's a dopey danger.  Stop it.  All right.  Let's go on to the next scary news piece.  Here we go, baby.  You're in your car.  You check the mirrors.  You're ready to back up.  Uh-oh.  Or are you?  No.  Yes.  What?  What? 
[01:45:00]  That exposes what you don't see in the rear view.  Blind spot dangers.  Tonight at 10 on Channel 4, the local station.  Who didn't learn this in driver's ed?  And why the tribal drum music?  I don't know this.  What is that saying that black people are backing over me?  There's a pygmy behind you.  Watch out.  There's a black fidget behind your truck.  Boonga, boonga, boonga, boonga, boonga, boonga.  Of course.  And then we'll go through a montage of clips of grandma running over the grandson, the father  running over the kid, the mother running over the daughter. 
[01:45:30]  They'll run through all that, and it's tragic, and it happens, and oh, well, look out.  Danny, what's the answer there?  That is, I mean, it doesn't get any simpler than this.  I mean, if you drive an SUV, obviously you have a bigger blind spot, so you can watch out  for kids.  But a lot of the newer SUVs have safety things.  That sonar, where you hear the beep, a lot of them, now cameras, so you can look at the  camera as you're backing out.  Not yours.  You're just a big kid crusher.  I go by noise.  The noise of a child's neck.  What you think is the squish of a big wheel and a scream. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, it's my worst nightmare.  You know how you just have things, you're just constantly paranoid that there's one of  them, and the other one is like hitting somebody as I'm on my cell phone or texting  while I'm driving.  Well, that happens a lot.  A lot of people.  I go in the other lane sometimes, I'm on the other side, and I'm not going to...  It's like, how fast did that happen?  I just looked down for a second.  I'm very...  You know how many times I almost scrape my truck against the side of the Lincoln Tunnel?  I'm just driving, doing beep. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, man, come on, calm down, nigga.  And now there's cones in the middle of the lanes in every tunnel, so a lot of times if  you're looking at the number, you look down two seconds, and you hear, bah, you're just  knocking into these things.  And the police pull you over, you got like a bloody ribbon in your bumper, and they're  like, I didn't do nothing.  And they look at your phone, and the last thing they saw was, I want to taste your pee.  What were you writing?  Did you have to look up real quick because of the thud?  Like National Lampoon's Vacation when they forgot the dog on the back of the...  Poor guy was keeping up for about a mile. 
[01:47:00]  All right, let's get one more news tease in here before we have to take another break.  We got the last one of the day might be in the running to be the best one ever, by the  way.  I hope so.  All right, here's the next scary news tease.  If you're on any type of medication, CBS 2 reveals the one fruit juice you should never  wash it down with.  You're on any type.  I believe that is grapefruit juice.  Why?  I don't know.  Because the acidity will hurt the medicine. 
[01:47:30]  I could have told you that 20 years ago.  You don't take orange juice, grapefruit juice, anything with acid.  No, I think orange juice is okay, but grapefruit juice is like you never, you don't use it  at all.  The acid in citrus will dilute the medication.  Any type of...  I think it has to do with something with the...  It's a bunch of an aloe juice.  That's what you can't...  I think it's...  I'll take that with aloe juice.  No.  Where do you find aloe juice?  I'm high blood pressure.  I'm high blood pressure.  Aloe juice.  What about banana juice? 
[01:48:00]  Oh!  I think it does something to your stomach lining, and that way when the drug goes in...  I'm right.  Let's go.  All right.  Let's go to Danny.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny?  Better have an answer.  Anthony?  Yes?  When have you ever been wrong?  Thank you.  Stomach lining.  What is it?  I think too much of the drug...  It's grapefruit juice.  ...gets absorbed through because you've worn away some of the lining of your stomach.  So instead of like dissolving it slower, you're getting like a massive dose of this. 
[01:48:30]  Wait, why is Anthony right?  Because grapefruit juice is correct, but does it have something to do with the stomach, or  is it the acidity in the thing dilutes the medication?  It can react with the medication.  What?  That didn't help anybody at all.  Why would you ask Danny a medical question?  Dr. Danny?  Yes.  Dr. Danny?  I know.  He still takes aspirin from the wrong end.  Could you put this on your fist and help me take it? 
[01:49:00]  Grapefruit juice stinks, by the way.  It's awful.  Who's drinking that?  No one.  Any time I get a...  It's a bitter, awful fruit that tries to look like a sweet, lovely orange.  Yeah.  And any time I go to get one of these fruit platters, like if I'm staying at a hotel, and  I like a lot of cantaloupe and grapes and things like that, they put that goddamn grapefruit  on top of it and bitter out every bit of sweet goodness.  You know how you make a grapefruit delicious?  How?  You just take off the skin, the outside, the membrane. 
[01:49:30]  Like I got time for...  I want to pop grapes in my mouth.  I want to be fanned.  I want a harem feeding me lovely sweet fruit.  You throw the grapefruit over your shoulder, and you pick up a lovely orange.  An orange.  A grapefruit is like...  It's like a Vietnamese hooker with a razor in your mouth.  You're expecting loveliness, and you get awfulness.  Hey, we really got to take a break.  We're running on a show.  All right, let's do it.  We got to...  Danny, call us back after the break, first of all.  We got three news teases left, and they're really, really good.  Also, we got to talk about the latest teacher sleeping with a student. 
[01:50:00]  We got to do that before we leave the first half of the Opie and Anthony show.  Because this beast...  The sexiness is over, people.  We'll be doing a lot of time because she's not hot.  We'll get into that in a few minutes here.  It's the O-Day virus spreading across America.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05. 
[01:50:30]  That's 866-WOWME05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on this fine whip-em-out Wednesday.  Bumper stickers are being made all over the country.  Hopefully, you'll get a WOW sticker soon, I guess.  Keep listening to this fine station you're hearing us on.  The XM Nation, they already know how to get the WOW stickers. 
[01:51:00]  What were you saying, Jimmy?  I was just watching old Patrice try to stand up and hold his back.  Oh.  True 50-year-old man.  There you go.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Killing for us today.  He's going to be at Caroline's all this weekend, starting tomorrow night through Sunday.  212-757-4100 for tickets.  Get Danny back on the phone.  We've got to get through a couple more news teases.  Yeah, get him back on the phone.  And then we've got to talk about old Blockhead, like you guys were saying as we were coming back from break.  By the way, grapefruit juice interacts with enzymes that break down some of the medications in the liver, 
[01:51:30]  which could lead to elevated or decreased levels of those medications in the blood.  Thank you.  We were both kind of right.  Yeah.  I like being right.  Me and you both right.  We'll agree.  Two men.  Aloe juice?  Just right, aloe juice.  No one mentioned aloe juice.  No one cared.  It's healthy.  All right, here we go.  The next scary news tease.  Yes.  Is that why?  Yeah, Dan.  Bluetooth.  Enough with the Bluetooth.  Danny.  Yo.  Okay, good.  Here's the next scary news tease. 
[01:52:00]  Paul said, beware of your clean underwear.  Research is a real shocker.  Wait, wait.  Did she say?  No, I heard that wrong.  I heard that wrong.  Beware of your clean underwear?  You're not even safe from your clean underwear.  Now, this could be that it's not rinsed well enough, and the bleach that's in there is still in the material, and then when you sweat, you get bleat, and you'll get a rash.  No, it's this.  Wearing clean underwear?  You won't be after you hear this story. 
[01:52:30]  Stupid.  I got to hear that again.  Yeah, yeah.  Paul said, beware of your clean underwear.  Research is a real shocker.  A shocker.  It's a real shocker.  You're going to get the shocker.  You're going to get the shock syndrome?  What, your clean underwear?  Danny?  I already know the answer to it, by the way.  It's actually, if you wash your underpants in cold water, you don't kill the bacteria that could be living in there.  Bacteria.  And what is that really going to do?  Right.  Kill you, I guess, according to them. 
[01:53:00]  Really?  I don't know one person that got killed from their clean underwear.  What a way to die.  And if you're washing it in cold water, it's not clean underwear.  Yeah, you got to boil.  I boil mine in hot coffee.  Yeah, who's washing it in cold water?  I put mine in a coffee pot.  Sometimes I make soup.  And then even in cold water, if you're bleaching it, if they're, you know, whiteys.  And what's grown in your underwear?  Yeah, and what's so bad in growing it? 
[01:53:30]  How long are you wearing it that it's able to fest on like a Petri dish?  Starts looking like old cheese in the fridge.  That is a dopey non-story.  That's dumb.  I'm sorry he died because of his underwear.  And Danny, when you're reporting that, don't ever say underpants again, please, like a  three-year-old.  When you're washing your underpants.  My under-roofs.  They're under your pants.  But what happens? 
[01:54:00]  What's that?  What happens, though?  Skids, man.  Yeah, the bacteria spills up and makes infections.  Yeah, so I mean, if the bacteria doesn't die, I guess it could infect you three years.  Likes to crawl around through any orifice.  How about this?  If you're leaking bacteria, you deserve to die.  Yeah, just bury yourself.  It's all day that you're walking around with the bacteria.  Oh, with a little cranky.  Swamp ass.  A little cranky.  Got the swamp ass working.  In fact, uh...  Are you kidding me?  What are they saying?  The cold water kind of helps all that kind of just relax and... 
[01:54:30]  Nah, that's why...  It's like a spa for you.  We've said it before.  That's why you got to use the wipes that are put out now by all the tissue companies.  Charmin's got them.  And they're not called baby wipes anymore.  They're not baby wipes.  They got the aloe, and they clean everything up nicely.  I try to use...  It's wonderful.  It's not happening.  I need to do 85 rolls of toilet paper around my hand to even feel...  What, you got to flush 800 times?  I can't.  And those baby wipes, I tried it once, and it was like, you know, smuggling heroin from  Nicaragua.  It's like...  How do you do that? 
[01:55:00]  With your fingertips?  No, no, no.  How?  You got to take some toilet paper off the roll a little bit, and then wrap that around the  toilet paper.  What is wrong with you, Anthony?  Why?  What are you doing with the wipes?  I just take a wipe out, wipe my butt.  You don't want...  And if anything happens, then I do a quick hand wash.  See?  No.  No.  You prepare your hand with toilet paper, then grab a baby wipe?  You take about four sheets...  If you're going to use the baby wipes, then use the baby wipes.  Four sheets of toilet paper, then take the wipe and wrap it around the toilet paper, and 
[01:55:30]  then run that down there, and you're fine.  And then you put a stick on it, you tape it, and you wave it, and you make a treat.  It's stupid.  Did I make it sound that involved?  You did.  It keeps your hand away from anything that might...  Why can't you just take a baby wipe?  It's your own body.  Because they're too thin.  I don't like my hand, and that area only having this thin little thing between it.  I want the bulk of the toilet paper, but the nice coolness of the wipe over it.  This is a conversation that can only be held by people who eat like goats, you three. 
[01:56:00]  I can't do it.  I have to wipe whole pieces of meat.  All right, all right.  Keep it right there so they don't dump out, because that's really funny.  The next line is going to make them dump out half-American when I've heard what you just  said.  That is really funny.  You're running a butcher shop.  Well, if you eat blueberries and Triscuits all day, you can wipe with a Q-tip.  That's really funny.  I don't like the way you protect yourself from your own body. 
[01:56:30]  I don't like my hand having nothing but a half of a millimeter of material between  it and that area.  Have you ever gone into your own toilet?  No.  What?  To live?  What have you gone in?  What are you talking about?  I dropped my cell phone in recently.  You know what's happening in that cell phone?  Come on.  Bye-bye.  I don't care if I just bought it and have to pay $400 because I didn't go the year.  Did you ever have to go in to break one up?  Never.  What are you eating? 
[01:57:00]  Torpedoes?  Lots of egg whites.  To break it up.  I do that before they hit the bottom.  You never had one that...  No.  I've never had to break anything up.  It looked like you were struggling.  That's some type of fetish because no one ever had to do that.  And that's an awful toilet.  You have to break it up.  I personally have not.  But I swear.  But I've heard stories.  Yes, you did.  No, I swear.  What's coming out of you?  Greek statue arms?  He didn't even use it. 
[01:57:30]  Ope took off his shoes and socks and then jumped in and did like Lucy with the grapes.  Yeah.  Squishing it.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  All right, here we go.  Let's get all out of the toilet.  Let's get your breath.  We're running out of time here.  Yeah, we're running out of time.  Anthony's home with a curtain draped around.  We've got to talk about Blockhead before we get out of here.  So we're going to squeeze a few things in here in the next 10 minutes.  The next scary news tease. 
[01:58:00]  Listen to this one.  Tomorrow after the finale of Crossing Jordan, dangerous household cleaning products or tasty energy drinks?  How do you know for sure?  Catherine Garcia reveals a disturbing safety alert that's a little hard to swallow.  On Cleaner Confusion.  Tomorrow at 11.  Cleaner or tasty beverage?  Dangerous cleaning products or energy drinks.  Or like Gatorade or something.  Right, right.  How about the bottle it's in?  How about you learn how to read?  You dope.  How about you do some of that reading? 
[01:58:30]  How about if your Gatorade is next to the Pine Sol?  It's probably not Gatorade.  So what's the answer, Danny?  What's the answer?  It's the packaging.  They're packaging some floor cleaners that look exactly like a bottle of Gatorade.  And like some kid bought it thinking it was some energy drink.  Really?  And when he opened the cap and his eyes started to water and his nose got stuffed up, he thought this was some good stuff?  Once again, if you're doing that, we need to thin the herd.  Thinning the herd. 
[01:59:00]  We need to thin the herd anyway.  If you're getting confused by that, then you don't deserve to live.  And it is kind of a cleaning product.  It just like relieves you of all your intestines and innards.  Well, you know, the packaging wasn't pretty deceptive because like on the actual cleaning product itself, it had like pictures of fruit and stuff like that.  Right, right.  Relieves you of all your intestines.  Yeah.  Yeah, this guy's right.  You use the toilet paper first alone.  And then you use the wipe to like make sure everything's clean.  Yeah, that's what I do.  Yeah, but not just the wipe.  And then I go back to toilet paper sometime to dry up. 
[01:59:30]  Not just the wipe.  Why don't you get a bidet and a proctologist to hang around your apartment?  I'm not going to go to that extent.  Bill in Waterford on the instant feedback.  Does Ant shower and mutter to himself, still not clean?  Still not clean.  That's what I'm going to say.  He's a hyper.  No, no, no.  Yes, you are.  Nothing to do with that.  You're a Long Island metrosexual.  One of those dirty Mexicans was drinking beer when you went home in California and did something bad.  You wish.  Let me clean it.  It's dirty back here.  It's just a way of making sure it's spotless. 
[02:00:00]  That way when you have to walk around or something, you're not working up a froth.  What would you do if by accident you got a little on your index finger?  What would I do?  It's happened over my lifetime.  Would you cut your finger off?  I still have four good ones and a thumb.  No, but like we've discussed, it takes forever to clean that off.  Right.  Even when you think it is, you go to scratch your nose and go,  Oh, geez, it's still there.  Don't watch.  Just use your mouth. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  Here we go.  The last news tease for today.  Okay.  This could be a really good one.  It looks like it's good here on the desk.  This is a good one.  I'm scared.  Where is it?  Oh, come on.  What's going on?  Oh, my God.  What did I do?  Don't beat yourself up.  What did I do?  E-Rock screwed it up.  Just blame it on E-Rock.  I screwed it up.  Here we go.  It's at the center of a national investigation.  Registered sex offenders delivering mail. 
[02:01:00]  Are there sex offenders working for the Postal Service in Massachusetts?  It's happening in other parts of the country, and it could be happening here tonight on Fox 25 News at 10.  Could be happening here.  Basically, sex offenders delivering your mail.  Your mail.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  But we're not sure where.  Don't they have to go through some type of screening or something?  No?  Well, sex offenders have to work, too, is what they're saying. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  Maybe in the Postal Service.  Cut them some slack, right?  They pay special attention to your home if they see mail with, like, a Sesame Place return address.  Or any other type of child-like reference thing.  Oh, my God.  Just thing.  If you live on Sesame Street, I didn't even get this.  Hey.  Mail, mail on Sesame.  Danny, you got anything to add to that?  If the mail truck is driving around playing the Dora the Explorer theme. 
[02:02:00]  No?  Danny?  No, you guys.  You've gone with SpongeBob again.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, uh.  Bob the Builder.  That last one doesn't make the Hall of Fame, huh?  No.  No.  It's good, though.  We have two entries in the Hall of Fame.  This one.  Where are they?  Right here.  This one.  Now, a twist on the predator law could shut down religion.  Sure, it can.  And, of course, the greatest one ever that we're trying to beat someday.  Maybe one will surpass this.  One city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area. 
[02:02:30]  Problem is, it could be right next to your house.  The clean underwear doesn't make the Hall of Fame?  Nah.  Nah.  None of those make the Hall of Fame.  I don't know.  Didn't thrill me.  Clean underwear is a pretty, but for them to tease that, be careful, you're clean underwear.  You're clean underwear.  It's ridiculous, but it's not shocking.  Okay.  Yeah, Danny, those were all good news teases, but none make the Hall of Fame this time around,  so.  I will try harder for you next time.  So, what's the email address to send in your news teases?  Danny at foundrymusic.com.  That's Danny at foundry, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y, music.com. 
[02:03:00]  Will he answer your emails?  Send the answers, by the way.  Send the answers.  Pretty please.  Now we've got to get to this story.  Yes.  Let's get to Blockhead.  Patton Oswalt is in trouble.  This woman.  A woman, 44, nabbed for sex with boy 13, cop predator shared North Carolina home with  her alleged victim.  A 44-year-old North Carolina woman arrested Wednesday on charges.  She carried on a month-long sexual relationship with a 13-year-old boy. 
[02:03:30]  Linda Ann McBride was arrested Wednesday at the Winston-Salem home.  She shared with the boy and the son's grandmother, who cops said is a friend of McBride's.  She's facing two counts of statutory rape and decent liberties, and she was booked, and  she has a mugshot here that is just the most heinous.  Her head is so...  I've seen block-headed people before.  You could take a T-square and fit it perfectly on every corner of her head. 
[02:04:00]  Her jaw and the top of her head, completely square and flat front.  I have never seen a more pronounced frown than she has.  Grrr.  She's actually saying grrr.  There really should be words coming out of her face.  Grrr.  Grrr.  Grrr.  It's just a...  Now, she, uh, a lot of these, uh...  It looks like she has tape holding her glasses together like a nerd. 
[02:04:30]  I think she does.  She's got, like, the nerd tape going on.  And she's got this short, greasy hair.  She almost looks like Lady Di if Pesci put her head in a vice until her eye popped out.  It's Drew Carey.  She looks like Drew Carey.  She's awful.  Horrid.  Now, uh, we've seen other stories in the news of late that, uh, hot, hot teacher, the blonde,  that, uh, she had a relationship with one of her young students. 
[02:05:00]  And, um, everybody that saw the story was like, wow, what a lucky, uh, boy that was  to have that girl as, as, as his first experience.  This one, you look and go, oh my God, that poor child, what he had to go through, uh, with  this woman, and that blonde, that luscious blonde, got no jail time.  No jail time.  She's getting ready to go back.  She's getting in trouble because she can't stop.  She keeps sending them, uh, emails.  No, it doesn't matter.  She won't see jail.  The judge will go, aw, you're adorable. 
[02:05:30]  As long as the judge is a guy.  The judge is a guy, uh, let her off the hook.  The prosecution was like, I don't know what we're going to do.  Hot teachers don't do as much time as ugly teachers.  And they shouldn't.  She did no time.  This woman is going to be in jail forever.  She's going to rot in jail.  And the judge is going to just, like, lambast her on the stand.  You are a disgusting predator.  And people like you should not be on the streets.  You had a responsibility to a child.  And you, throw the book at her. 
[02:06:00]  It looks like they threw the book, squared her face, and it flattened it out.  They would actually put her in a guillotine if they could find a hole big enough and stick  that hair through.  It's a round hole for the guillotine.  She's got a square head.  What do we do?  It doesn't fit.  What do we do?  She has cowlicks in the front of her hair.  All over the place.  Her hairline is like Nosferatu.  She's got that widow's peak.  What happened there?  Oh, you shit.  What a frown.  What a mug.  The frowny face. 
[02:06:30]  What a fat curmudgeon.  And she will do time, people.  She looks like Brutus.  She's in a relationship with Popeye.  Guck, guck, guck, guck, guck.  It would have been funny if I said Olive.  I didn't think that's it.  All right.  We're heading out of here to start the second half of the Opie and Anthony show exclusively  on XM Satellite Radio.  Join us.  We'll be in the lobby.  Today was the first day we were asking for hot girls to join us on the walk because it's  Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Good luck to us on that one.  Let's see how many show up today in the lobby for the walkover that we broadcast on XM. 
[02:07:00]  Patrice O'Neal, thank you so much.  He'll be joining us for a little longer.  He's at Caroline's this weekend here in New York City.  212-757-4100.  Thanks for checking us out today, guys.  All right.  We're outside Free FM in New York City. 
[02:07:30]  We're starting our walk at XM Satellite Radio.  Loves Lil' Jimmy's meaty breasts.  We've got more and more signs showing up every morning.  O&A Party Rock sign.  We get a picture of those signs?  Nick, Jimmy, why don't you talk to these guys?  They're from Canada and they love you.  Let's move this way, though.  For many, many a year.  Oh, thank you.  Where in Canada are you from?  Toronto, Ontario.  We came down in a big rig.  Why are you guys down here?  We absolutely love you guys.  And I'm making a delivery.  We walk about 10, 15 city blocks just to see you. 
[02:08:00]  Thank you very much.  Nice sign.  By the way, your sign stinks.  Yeah.  O&A.  I didn't know what to say.  I didn't know what this sign is.  I introduced this to the show the first time last night driving down.  I had no idea about this show and I listened to it.  It was pretty cool.  Okay.  You're new to that.  So your abominable sign is excusable.  Excuse me, miss.  May I shake your hand, sir?  Yeah, of course.  Oh.  We got more people out here.  And now look at what we got here.  Miss, what's your name?  Michelle.  And Michelle, I like your shirt. 
[02:08:30]  Tell everybody what it says.  It says Bimmel 14.  Bimmel 14.  Because that's the size she was, Frederica.  About the size of 14.  What did you do?  What did you do?  That's nice.  Frederica would have been a little nice.  A little Frederica on top just so people would really get it.  That's her MySpace page picture.  Oh, it is?  Yes, it is.  Are you on my friend list?  I don't know.  I have 20,000.  Really?  How many do you have, Jim?  Over 26.  I don't think you approved my request.  Why? 
[02:09:00]  The only thing I don't approve are gaping.  Any guy that's like a gaping asshole, I deny as a friend.  Why?  Because in real life, he wouldn't be my friend, Jim.  Yes, he is.  Why should he be a cyber friend?  Hot.  Very hot.  I've only denied, I think, three people on my friend list.  And I accept everybody.  And it's usually just men's gaping assholes I will not have as friends.  Here, I'll take the picture for you.  Oh, is it photo op time?  Yeah.  All right.  The Canadians won a picture with them. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, we'll take one.  Whoa, Jimmy Norton.  The Canucks won a little photo.  Hold on.  Here we go.  One, two.  Hey, will you look at the camera?  Oh, I'll stay here.  Look at the camera.  I am, Opie.  Now you're talking.  Hold on.  I've got to take it.  I'm looking at the camera and talking.  I was talking about the...  I'm a broadcaster.  I'm taking a picture over here, and you didn't even know it.  There you go.  All right.  I'm over here now.  Let's start the walk to...  So how do you find America?  You just drive south.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's right.  That's a joke.  That's right.  Get in the car and look for the economy. 
[02:10:00]  LOL.  What are the Canadians hauling, by the way?  We like to ask that when the truckers talk to us.  You name it, we haul, but we brought down windows for today.  Windows?  A bunch of windows for an apartment building.  Ooh.  We can't make those here in America?  I know, right?  What the fuck?  Why are we having windows come down from Canada?  And porting windows.  I'm sorry.  Why are we having windows brought down from Canada?  What are we sending up there?  Snow?  See?  We have it here. 
[02:10:30]  Can I just run out into traffic until I get hit?  It's the window capital of the world?  At least this little company is, but you name it, we haul it.  All right.  Well, God bless you.  All right.  It's obvious we're not going to get anything else out of the Canadians, so let's start the walk.  Again, just like in real life.  Patrice.  Kidding.  We've got to get Patrice front and center, because the last time he walked with us was just terrific.  Wow.  The streets are busy.  There's almost a hustle and bustle.  Why do we have no guest mic yet?  Let's start working on the guest mic. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Could we, please?  Yeah, can we get a fourth mic, please, Patrice?  And where's Patrice's headphones?  Yeah, headphones and a mic.  My God, it's not always just about us three.  That's right, douchebags.  This city is just, every time I walk out of it, it's just a depressing city.  Hi.  It's just a lonely, depressing city.  That's a big cup of coffee there, young lady.  Look at this jockey.  Hey, how you doing?  Hi.  How you doing?  Everyone with coffee and iPods, we certainly are sheep.  And they hand us down.  You're all just sheep, iPods and sheep. 
[02:11:30]  Look at her, no eye contact, just a funny.  Nothing.  They don't even want to look at you.  Oh, Jesus.  What are you listening to?  There's a whole world going on out here.  Don't even pay attention.  Nothing.  Doesn't even look.  They don't even give a shit.  That's the oldest lesbian in Manhattan.  Doesn't even look.  He drops out there.  This black girl will talk.  She'll talk to you.  Don't you know there's life going on beyond the iPod and the thing?  Listen to life.  Society, there's a city.  Everybody, it's just a shame.  Listen to life.  The Hoffman, I hold himself up. 
[02:12:00]  I know.  That kid fights.  I stink.  That kid's a wrestling.  You see that kid's ears?  We just passed Rick Moranis.  I told you we're going to find.  You know how many stars we're going to find today?  There you go.  More people out today.  Something's wrong with her legs.  There's nothing better than a sexy bitch with some kind of affliction.  Yeah.  Oh, that guy's plotting something.  Like a beautiful woman who's pigeon-toed with a bad knee.  Fucking makes my dick hurt.  Holy shit. 
[02:12:30]  Indian hairdo.  Wow.  How are you, sir?  Sir.  How you doing, sir?  Can we talk to you, sir?  You got 85 haircuts.  Holy shit.  That guy was Indian or something from that area.  He lived in three different eras.  Old cinnamon.  He had a disco, early Carson stand-up suit on.  Oh, man.  Here we go. 
[02:13:00]  A future jumping out the window because the stock market dropped.  Here we are at our first intersection, per usual.  We're crossing the street.  Oh, we're doing it different today.  Yeah.  We're crossing here today.  There you go.  Look at the city, man.  Oh, I hate these people.  You better be happy you don't work.  Imagine if you had to.  Oh, if I had to do this.  And you know Anthony hates being in the street.  Real job.  This is such an act for Anthony.  This brother is constantly pushing us.  This is so acting.  If they get enough money, Anthony's going to build a walkway, a slide from XM Studio, from 
[02:13:30]  CBS to XM, and just get into a little chute.  Like one of those pills you put.  You ever go to Walgreens and you put the little pill thing that shoots?  Or the bank, an air tube.  It's just going to vacuum me over to XM.  Pretending to love people.  I hate every single one of these motherfuckers.  Oh, look at this. 
[02:14:00]  You know a creepily sexy girl here?  She looks like...  She's ugly and beautiful at the same time.  She looks like the brother brings her on the bicycle for the GIs and the NOM.  Hey, did Patrice meet soon to be...  Only fuck the ones with hepatitis.  How you doing there, Mac?  You're still here.  That's Mac, also known as Keith Robinson someday.  This gets creepy.  Yeah.  You guys are going to stop this walk soon.  As soon as the talk radio guy shows up.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  You're dead, fucker.  You're dead, fucker.  Oh, I know, right?  We don't need that guy.  He's already got the body of everyone.  Gentlemen, how are you?  Snapping a few pictures of the walk.  Look at Obi the date.  Hello, miss.  Hi, miss.  Holy shit.  You like that, Jimmy?  You're like, Obi!  I don't know you.  I don't know you.  You look like a Russian.  I nodded.  Oh, man.  6-6-0-6. 
[02:15:00]  Nacho Libre.  All right, with the Almond remake.  The full Dark Saints.  What else you got?  It's 6-6-6, Jimmy.  I know.  Doesn't it scare you?  No.  It doesn't.  But you'd be frightened and scared.  Eric trying to look like he's busy in his stupid Jägermeister jacket scares me more.  Doing nothing.  I know.  It's May, shithead.  Pink tie.  He walks for a long time.  All right.  No one standing in front of the building here.  Sean the creepy intern. 
[02:15:30]  There it is.  Oh, look at this jolly, non-threatening black man walking down the sidewalk.  Doesn't he look jolly and fun?  Yes.  Mr. Huxtable.  Hello, sir.  How are you today?  Oh, a couple from out of town.  I'm sorry about what happened with the bus strike.  Where are you visiting New York from, sir?  No.  Douchebag town?  What an asshole.  Hope you get fucking piped over the head in the subway, you old cunt.  That guy was a... 
[02:16:00]  I'm a tough guy.  I pick on William Frohley.  You could tell the tourists.  Yeah.  And so can the muggers.  He'll find his justice.  Pits on this fucking monster.  Holy shit.  You must have...  Wow.  Miss?  Wow-wee.  Wow-wee?  Uh-oh.  Wow.  How hot were you in 67?  Now we're in trouble.  Now we're in trouble.  She went into the building.  Now we're in trouble.  It's just like, oh, no.  Now we're in trouble.  Why don't we walk further away from the building? 
[02:16:30]  Away from the building.  You can say wow-wee.  No, you can't.  Okay.  No, they get really mad at us.  The wow-wee wasn't the part.  It was the...  She didn't hear me say that.  Oh, she didn't?  No, she was across the street.  All right.  That sounds good enough.  Are we getting smoothies?  That lovely lady that just walked by, I rode the elevator up with her yesterday.  Did you?  Hates us.  Who cares?  Fuck her.  A lot of people hate us.  Her's stupid.  I was fuckable a long time ago.  Miss?  You're right here. 
[02:17:00]  Oh, my God.  That's an ugly baby.  Oh.  We should buy her a cat and put it in the crib.  Go ahead.  Trust me.  We're doing you a favor.  All right.  There's nothing going on out here today, so why don't we get our smoothies and drop stairs  and start the second half?  That's a gay bag, sir.  Hey, Elton John wants his wig back.  How come when guys go to buy things in stores, they've got to put them in gay bags sometimes,  like pink? 
[02:17:30]  Or God forbid you buy something at Abercrombie and Fitch, you have to walk around with naked  men on your bag.  Naked men on your bag, that means something different.  There's a happy fellow.  Look at this.  I like this guy that wants to be fan.  You can upgrade it.  Little Steven over there.  And that's how he's got it.  So is it?  The real little Steven?  Who's little Steven?  The real little Steven.  From Bruce's band.  Well, where is he?  He's in the Range Rover.  He's in the Range Rover right there.  He's just looking to see what's going on over here, because there's microphones and things. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, let's go get a picture with him.  He's checking it out.  Get a picture with him.  He works for the enemy.  He does work for the enemy.  He's making a U-turn.  Oh, he might get crushed by the cab.  That would have been great.  Little Steven almost got creamed, man.  I think he made a U-turn to check us out again, because he was all thumbs up when he drove by.  Yeah, he almost got T-boned.  That was really good. 
[02:18:30]  We could have been the first to report it.  All right, why don't we go upstairs?  There's nothing going on, huh?  Nah.  All right, we'll start the ONA show, the second half, in just a bit.  Anthony and Anthony, XM202.  Where the fuck am I?  What the fuck is this kid?  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids.  Pornography in the workplace.  We played on TV screens for drawings.  They ran back and took off with a family car.  People making nasty comments about women. 
[02:19:00]  Viruses spreading in our area.  Find out where.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Push the button!  I'm a black ninja, fuck face!  All right, we remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dogg on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  Just give me some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log you're going to have.  Holy shit.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:19:30]  Holy shit.  Yahoo.  Envy.  Oh.  With O.B.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Good old Ben.  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating boob.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock.  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when Hawk fucks up.  Shut up.  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls.  You just relax. 
[02:20:00]  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Bear with me.  More editing fucks up.  All good.  Now let's get the show on the road.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[02:20:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  2.  And this is the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[02:21:00]  I guess they're in the bathroom right now.  We're waiting for them.  Come on in, fans.  Travis or nobody.  They're going to leave me here.  That's just great.  Have fun crashing and burning.  Thanks.  Appreciate it.  Yeah, kill the music too.  Just let me sit here and mumble to myself while we wait.  This is great.  High over to the room there.  Pal Talk is up.  Well, one of the cams are up. 
[02:21:30]  And we're waiting.  Patrice O'Neill is joining us today.  Yeah.  So this is just a lot of fun.  And here comes Opie.  The stupid E-Rock show.  Yep, it's the...  Yeah.  Here you go.  Now, continue eating your balls, E-Rock.  Yeah, that was terrific.  Eat your balls.  That was terrific.  That was the longest elevator ride I've ever taken. 
[02:22:00]  Holy shit.  And then who's the jackass that hit the floor three and floor four and no one got out?  Who do you think?  Bust you up, bastards.  Who do you think?  Do you eat a smoothie?  Yeah, smoothie.  Smoothie.  Good.  Yeah, it's definitely a smoothie day.  Let me get Pal Talk up.  People get a little...  All right, let's go right to the phone.  Say hi to Josh in Pennsylvania.  Josh, what's up?  Hi, boys.  Hey, Josh. 
[02:22:30]  What up, Josh?  Hi.  I'm on the radio.  Hey.  So my company, going about what Anthony was saying with the wonderful iPod culture,  my company just partnered with a company yesterday where you literally send them all of your CDs,  as many as you can fit on a 60 gig iPod, and they will rip them and preload them onto an iPod that they sell you at full retail.  Oh, yeah?  Sounds like pretty good service.  No, it certainly is not. 
[02:23:00]  It's $2 per CD.  $2 per CD?  Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.  Some people have money, and others, well, the world needs ditch diggers, too, you know.  Step on my line, I stepped on his.  Yeah, that guy just sucked.  No, he was good.  What happened?  No, he was horrible.  All right.  Jim didn't know Little Steven was on Sopranos?  Yes, I did.  I just didn't know the name Little Steven.  If he would have said Steven Van Zandt, I would have known that was him.  Take it up with Chris.  Chris?  Jimmy? 
[02:23:30]  Yes?  You missed your chance, man.  Little Steven is Silvio from The Sopranos.  No, no, no.  I know that.  I know, but he was in a truck.  There was no way to get a shot with him.  All right, man.  Good to know.  Almost with his corpse lying in the road.  Boy, did he almost get clipped.  A U-turn on 57th.  I think he was following us from CBS, actually.  I never heard the Wise Guys show, but it must be really funny.  It's absolutely horrific.  Is it bad?  Yeah, it's really, really bad.  Definitely bad.  Is there a lot of, like, we're going to whack you jokes? 
[02:24:00]  Sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, don't do that.  You might roll over, Goomba.  Hey, hey, hey.  Huh?  A lot of that.  A lot of hey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, hey.  You know what happened that time with the Russian?  Hey, huh?  Oof.  Did it.  All right.  We're going to do some things today.  We got some gourmards coming in.  Hey, hey, hey, oh.  Oh, look at the pasta vajalos on her.  Hey, oh, my hoe. 
[02:24:30]  Shut up.  Hey, we're sitting here with Patrice O'Neill, our favorite moulin yarn.  Oh, hey, oh.  And for those of you who don't know, it's an eggplant.  Oh.  Is what they call it.  It was.  Hey.  Pass the gobbling.  Yeah, that dumb food talk.  Hey, when I was growing up, really, you ate a lot?  I'm sure you did.  You know what's good?  A nice galamar.  A piece of galamar.  Hey, don't eat that. 
[02:25:00]  We're going to whack you.  And then you put a little rigolk.  Rigolk on there.  And what you get there?  You stir the sauce.  What kind of show is that?  Hey, huh?  Hey, get out of here.  It's Johnny.  Johnny Fatfeet.  Oh.  Doing traffic.  Nothing worse.  Where's the dump report?  Don't we immediately get that?  Maybe there were no dumps today.  Impossible.  Yesterday, what?  There was 22 dumps on the first half of the show?  22.  Just you and your filthy cake evacuation. 
[02:25:30]  Dude, man.  Did you smell it in the bathroom?  I certainly didn't.  Why not?  I didn't.  I smell yours.  I know.  Sorry.  On purpose?  Not on purpose, but...  I didn't need a rod during the show.  Let's say hi to A Block.  A Block.  What's happening, boys?  What's up, A Block?  Yeah, I want to thank you very much for cussing your asses off yesterday.  I won $100.  We had an over-under 20 dumps.  Wow.  You guys had 22, new world record.  Thank you very much. 
[02:26:00]  I've got $50 on Patrice O'Neal getting dumped for saying sperm thingies today.  Let's hear it.  Punch it out, boys.  Well, we don't have the sheet yet.  Bobby, I'm giddy with anticipation, waiting on it.  All right.  They're printing it out as we speak, so we'll have that in moments here.  Also, on this half of the Opie and Anthony show, we got a couple of really interesting  clips from House.  House.  On an old new house.  Just when I think, when we make fun of it, that we've gotten ridiculous and maybe taken 
[02:26:30]  it a little over the top, no.  You see an ad for House or an episode, and it's so ridiculous that there is no realism  on this show.  And I'm hearing all the time, dude, you just got to watch it.  It's a great show.  I don't like those shows.  I don't watch medical shows because I always think I have it, whatever they have.  And House is the worst because, as we've said in the past, it starts off as something 
[02:27:00]  nothing.  She came in with a scalp itch.  It turned into a brain tumor working its way through her skull as she's convulsing.  What did House do?  House had to kill eight babies, chop off their feet, and make a tumor-reducing stew from their  toes.  And you think that sounds crazy?  No, it's not.  No, we got two good examples, actually. 
[02:27:30]  The real episodes are even more ridiculous.  Who would go to House?  Who would call up and make an appointment?  Oh, Jimmy's not happy.  Uh-oh.  We had some action in the 840 area of the first half of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Why don't we do the dump report?  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Well, here are the dumps for this May 24th, 19, uh, 1906, yeah, 2006. 
[02:28:00]  I'm still writing 19 on six years later.  Uh, let's see.  At 747, oh, we went quite a ways there.  We did all right.  Uh, Patrice, yeah, right when Patrice came in and had to say, things that make sperm  come out.  Hey, you know, I was going to finish it, and I saw all of you go, eee, with that face,  like, no sperm.  We all turned and looked at Patrice and went, oh, no, he's the first dump.  Uh, at 840, Opie saying, wipe my butt. 
[02:28:30]  Jesus.  During an extended discussion about wiping, by saying this, everything was illuminated,  uh, illuminated to what was being talked about.  See, during an extended discussion about wiping, there's where it happens.  If you, if you're constantly pounding something, and our discussion was lengthy about wiping,  and then wipe my butt, it's too graphic.  You could say, you know, eh, well, when I wipe my butt, uh, it kind of hurt. 
[02:29:00]  You say it once, there's a one-off.  Well, you should have been goddamn dumped for your fucking, take a, take a tissue, and  then you put four slices of tissue, and one wipe a dude, whatever.  I am fucking Baryshnikov, the way I can dance around.  Around doo-doo?  This shit that is FM radio.  Oh, fuck you.  I am such a pro at it.  It's true, Patrice, it's true.  That, it is ridiculous.  It's true, it's true.  I'm a, I'm a, I'm a godsend to FM radio people. 
[02:29:30]  Anthony can talk about shit like no one else.  I can.  Give me a subject, I'll talk about it on FM, no matter how graphic.  Baby fucking.  Baby fucking.  Jesus.  You take a baby ass, and you fuck it.  Way to go, Ant, way to straighten me out.  What?  At 842, what's coming out of you?  Greek statue arms?  That was such a great line.  Now, it's such a funny fucking line.  That never should have been dumped.  And, uh, again, I think it was because we were talking about it so much, but, yeah, I 
[02:30:00]  don't see how that, that's, that's one that I don't really agree with.  This guy's a fucking panicky girl on the dump button.  But we did save, uh, Patrice's, he, he wipes whole pieces of steak out of his body.  Yeah, thank God.  You were ready to destroy that great line, and we saved your ass.  And I think if you said, what's coming out of you, Greek statue arms, and, but the, the,  the place we were describing was the ass.  We were doing a lot of ass talk there.  It was about shitting.  I know.  It was about wiping.  So, when you say, what's coming out of you, you could then put together that, you mean 
[02:30:30]  coming out of your ass.  What about, what if we meant spiritually?  Uh, ooh.  Very good.  Spiritually out your ass?  Is that what you said?  Spiritually.  I know, spiritually, a Greek statue arm is coming out of your, your, your, your aura.  He's spiritually out of a Greek statue arm.  And, uh, at 842, again, squishing it.  Oh, no.  Norton, talking about Anthony wiping his butt.  Did I say squishing it?  Squishing it.  I don't remember you saying it.  I don't either.  I'm saying, uh, squishing it.  It's something squishy. 
[02:31:00]  Four dumps today.  I was probably, I was probably talking about when Ope was tap dancing on it, and they missed  on, the dump guy misread it, and thinking I was referring to what you were saying when I was getting  to another line that's going to be something else.  So who's, who's, who, who's in there deciding that it's being dumped?  Uh, fucking, uh, Cardinal O'Connor.  Actually, I think we've done pretty well.  When you, when, when you look.  We're losing, uh, some battles here and there, but in general.  Out of everything that we've said.  I mean, we said sperm three or four times on that show, and all the other sperm references  were fine. 
[02:31:30]  So, and we saved your steak line.  Racism.  Four things.  That's not bad.  The dog is right.  Throughout the course of the whole thing, not bad.  We're not going to win every single one.  I know, but I like to win.  Let's go to, winning is, Carol in Indiana.  Carol?  Hello.  Hi, Carol.  Hi.  Well, I think you're, um, underrating the House program, because last week's episode had  two references to blowjobs, and on this week's episode, they had an exploding testicle.  Yeah, well, this seems to be what's going on on House, but this is the, the stuff that 
[02:32:00]  people say makes House great, I say makes it awful.  Why?  Every goddamn episode doesn't have to be, can the guy treat a little case of the sniffles  and just have the person go home okay?  Does it always have to be somebody comes in with maybe, uh, I don't know, an earache, and  their balls explode?  Well, it makes for good television.  No, it doesn't.  It makes for fake, hypochondriac-inducing house drama. 
[02:32:30]  It's obviously good TV.  It's one of the top-rated shows on TV.  I know, and now, no, it's not.  All right, we got some, uh, House clips.  We got two quick ones today.  Now, Stan, uh, you're familiar with these clips?  Uh, yeah.  I caught House.  House is great to watch when you're sort of on your computer, and you can just listen  for the squishes.  Is that it?  Yeah.  And you know you've hit, uh, pay dirt.  Pay dirt.  Um, yeah, it was a little bit weird.  In this one, he, uh, gets shot at the start. 
[02:33:00]  House gets shot.  House gets shot.  By some former patient, I guess.  Of course.  Who wouldn't shoot this guy?  You go in with nothing, you come out, uh, you got all kinds of diseases.  But there's also this, uh, other guy who came in originally, the actual sort of patient  person, um, whose tongue has swollen up to the point where he, like, can't talk or barely  breathe.  Don't you wish that would happen to our own E-Rock?  What's the matter?  He just walked in.  He gave me the look like, I just walked in. 
[02:33:30]  You hurt his feelings.  Just want his tongue to swell up till he can't breathe.  Someone had to start the show today.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  The poor kid is working hard.  He does nothing but give, and then gives more.  And all we do is hurt him.  Hey, what the fuck?  You're going to make me start thinking about what I did here.  You all right, Eric?  I'm fine.  Ah, smoothies!  Smoothies are here.  Thanks, Ken.  Stop the program.  Smoothies are here.  Yeah, I did.  No, you didn't.  You said you want something more substantial.  Shut up with your lying.  I wanted a smoothie.  Well, you didn't say it. 
[02:34:00]  And now it's too late.  Jimmy's a liar.  I'm not a liar.  You lie a lot.  I wanted four smoothies.  Why is Patrice drawing three-dimensional smoothies?  Stop sucking up to Anthony.  What's wrong with you?  That is really nice.  It's a weird thing I do.  It's a good job.  Sometimes in the tub, when I'm cleaning the tub and I have the scrubbing bubbles, I just  draw a swastika.  Rub-a-dub-dub swastikas in the tub.  I don't know.  It's just like, you know, I draw a scrubbing bubble swastikas.  I used to draw those on my sneakers. 
[02:34:30]  Remember the old sneakers?  How'd you stand from there?  How can you not?  Jesus.  It's a fluorescent marker.  Remember the old sneakers that had the wooden, like, wooden, wooden, the rubber half a moon  kind of thing.  Wooden sneakers.  I lived in Holland.  The rubber, like, half a moon thing over the toe area.  They're your basic sneaker.  I used to draw swastikas on those when I was, like, in first grade. 
[02:35:00]  And a teacher came up to me in the playground and started yelling at me like a mad woman.  And she goes, those are swastikas.  I went, oh, really?  And she said, do you know what those represent?  And I said, no, I don't.  She goes, why did you draw it on your sneakers?  I said, because they look cool.  And that was it.  I didn't know any ideology.  I didn't know the horror, the thing. 
[02:35:30]  This teacher assumed that in first grade, I'm going to know that it is a symbol of terror  and horror and not just a symbol that kind of looked cool to a first grader.  What's your excuse now?  It's kind of sad that a lot of stuff like that kind of looked great.  You know, the devil worshiping symbol is a cool thing to draw and play out with.  It's actually a Southeast Asian symbol for peace back before the Nazis picked it up. 
[02:36:00]  And the American Indians also used it as a peace-type symbol.  Hitler just was a motherfucker.  Hitler just wrecked a bunch of stuff.  The little mustache, the swastika, ruined it all.  Good thing he didn't have them go do the thumbs up.  We wouldn't be able to do that today.  Fonzie would have been considered a racist.  If he lived, he would have destroyed the smiley face.  You gave him enough time.  Hey, Fonzie, what are you doing tonight?  Killing the Bernstein twins.  Hey.  Hey.  And instead of a jukebox, he's hitting a Jew right in the head. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Knock his yarmulke off.  Sing, Jaime.  Instead of jumping a shark, he just throws a Jew right in with the shark.  Yeah, he's hitting the jukebox.  Or he jumps a Jew lawyer and calls it a shark.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Don't ruin our American institutions like the Fonz like that. 
[02:37:00]  Hey.  Bosley.  You're a Jew, right?  Hey.  Hey.  Bosley.  That's a Jew name.  Bosley.  Bosley Steen.  Hey.  You fucking Jew.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Arnold.  You know what he is.  Hey.  Look at that nose.  Who do you think burned down his fucking diner?  Hey.  I'd rather have the fucking gook on it than this fucking Jew.  Hey.  Now Vecchio my balls.  Hey.  Hey.  You ain't Italian.  You're a Jew. 
[02:37:30]  You're a Jew.  I'll tell you about happy days before the Jews got here.  Hey.  Hey.  You talk about happy fucking days.  Hey.  Whoa.  He pulls out a big stick and pretends he's going to club one of the Jews and then combs  his head.  And his best friend is Richie can't eat a ham. 
[02:38:00]  Can't eat a ham.  You're an ass.  Richie can't eat a ham.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  It's Ralph Mouth and his friend Moxie.  Hey, Ralph.  Shoot that Jew in the face.  I still got it.  My foreskin, Fonz.  I still got it.  I still got it.  Hey, shortcake. 
[02:38:30]  Shortcake.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Hey.  There you go.  He just ripped apart from the Fonz as a racist.  Oy vey.  Oy vey.  Hold on, Fonz.  Your real name is Winkler.  Hey.  Hey.  Keep it on the Q-T-O.  Oh. 
[02:39:00]  Are we back in house yet, or what?  Oh, no.  Oh.  Back to house.  So, what happened last night, then?  A Jew walked into house.  On a goddamn anti-Semitic happy date.  Oh, God.  So, uh.  Oy vey.  Uh, right before house gets shot.  Yes.  This guy comes in with the freaky illness. 
[02:39:30]  Then he gets shot.  Of course he does.  And they sort of spend the rest of the episode, uh, house can't figure out whether or not he's  hallucinating.  Ah, okay.  Good to see he's been shot.  Yeah.  And they do some unorthodox treatment to him.  Now, how long after house gets shot is he doing stuff with patients?  Not long after, but he can't decide if he's up and around because he's hallucinating.  They're saying he might be in a coma.  The whole episode might be him in a coma just dreaming or whatever, right?  Soprano desk.  Kind of like fucking, uh, like, uh, Dallas. 
[02:40:00]  Complete ripoff.  Yeah.  No, not like Dallas, actually.  All right, hold on a minute.  Pat from Wienarkey.  Pat!  Hey!  Hey, Pat.  Hey!  The oven doesn't work and Fonzie hits it with his fist and fires right up.  Holy shit, Pat.  That is horrible.  It was right away, Pat.  Hey, Pat.  Yes?  Uh, did you get your van fixed? 
[02:40:30]  A lot of people want to know.  Uh, well, I've been having my eating contest lately, so I'm scheduling it.  My van sounds like a thunderstorm when I drive from the sheet metal on the roof.  Rattling.  They're all in the shower.  Nothing's happening.  Duck!  Hey!  Hey!  Whoa!  Oh.  All right, Pat.  All right, thank you.  Damn funny, Pat.  All right, here's a house clip from last night's episode.  Wow.  I would have been money something would have gone wrong. 
[02:41:00]  Let's rotate him back.  He's bleeding into his ocular orbit.  LP wouldn't do this.  Lots of pressure behind.  Got to relieve it.  Oh, I know.  What are these goals?  I should go.  I should have torn my stitches. 
[02:41:30]  So that sequence was, um, I thought the operation went all right.  Um, his eyeball starts popping out of his socket.  Actually, that squish you hear is, they show on Fox the eyeball popping out of the socket.  The guy's eyeball popped out of its socket.  Yeah.  Like, not even Total Recall had the, uh, the balls to show that.  Right.  But in house.  Yeah.  And, and, and, well, why did this happen? 
[02:42:00]  I don't know.  Was it a house mistake?  Again?  Was it someone that works at this hospital?  Shouldn't this hospital just, uh, just be closed for so many lawsuits?  It was one of these mystery things.  Because they keep trying to figure out what the thing is.  Of course.  Yeah.  The mystery hospital.  And at the, at, in the end of the clip, the house just passes out.  Mm.  Because he's been shot.  Here's a, a second clip from house.  Test was negative.  You knew?  Force of habit.  Showed no cancer.  No reason why he's got a fever of 103.  And no reason why his tongue won't fit in his mouth. 
[02:42:30]  He's post-op.  Chase is getting him up and around.  It's important that you're up ASAP after surgery.  Think you can urinate?  It's getting bigger.  What, are you getting aroused?  No.  It's not that way.  It's not that way.  It's not that way.  It's not that way.  What is that? 
[02:43:00]  Holy shit.  Um, I believe that was the, um, that was the guy, the, the patient, trying to go to  the bathroom.  He had this swollen tongue.  Yeah.  Because he couldn't talk.  An eye patch at this point.  And then he's taking a leak.  Um, and the, uh, there's obviously a problem.  The young doctor goes to see what it is.  Yeah.  And, uh, pretty much the guy explodes blood all over him.  He, he's got a fever.  But did he have a heart on? 
[02:43:30]  I guess so.  The guy goes, you're aroused?  I think it was filling up with blood, which I guess is kind of a heart on.  And then his dick exploded?  Or just shot blood all over the place.  His ball exploded.  Oh, his ball?  Is that what it was?  And his blood shot out of his dick all over the doctor.  Yeah.  On an all new house.  See, I can't make up stuff that is worse than what happens on the real show.  Well, the, the way the episode ended was tremendous because, like I said, he doesn't know if it's 
[02:44:00]  all hallucination or not.  So he decides the only way to do it is to, um, kill the patient.  Which I goof about all the time about house.  Yeah.  How he's got to kill people.  His, uh, his, uh, his prescription was to kill the patient because if he was hallucinating  and he did something that crazy, he'd wake up.  And what if he wasn't hallucinating?  Thanks.  Well, house is willing to take a chance.  What a dumb fucking show.  I hate house.  I've never seen it.  I watched it once and, and I have a, I have like an ugly spot for it anyway because it's 
[02:44:30]  the show that took over the jury, the show I was on.  Oh, okay.  And they canceled the jury during the commercial.  I went to the bathroom and came back and the jury was off.  I had a meeting with Fox about the jury.  Like I mentioned the jury and everybody in the room went, oh, good God.  Like it was just like, I wanted to just fucking, I really was thinking I was going to make  a good show.  Hey, how about a show, The Jury?  Hey. 
[02:45:00]  You know what?  I can't watch either this edgy Gilligan's Island.  I've never seen it and I can't get into this, this fucking lost.  Oh, lost.  Yeah.  I haven't seen an episode of Lost.  I've never seen the show.  I just won't watch it.  It's so huge and none of us have seen it.  I haven't seen it.  Couldn't understand.  I saw, oh, you've seen it then?  It's fantastic.  But, but.  Isn't it a good show?  Yeah.  I hear it's very confusing.  At the end, do like the, the, the fucking, like natives, do they run real fast over the  water?  Like. 
[02:45:30]  Or does Gilligan swim away real fast and they almost get off the island?  Run into the lagoon.  Fuck it.  I can't.  It's, I can't.  Now it looks like something with the, like the whole thing is kind of like, it was a  grand scheme.  The plane crash and everything.  Well, yeah.  Tonight we actually learn why the plane crash and the first place.  Are you really going to learn though?  Or is it?  No.  It was, well.  Who knows how much they're going to give.  A news teaser.  Yeah.  They're going to just tease it.  Jeff, the trucker. 
[02:46:00]  What's up?  Hey, you got props for that line.  If he'd have lived, he'd have destroyed his smiley face.  I thought that was really funny.  That could have been a great line, but I threw it right in the middle of the, as they were  revving up the, the Fonzie fan.  Antasemitic Fonzie.  Antasemitic Fonzie.  I was so pissed at myself.  I'm like, man, I know this is a great line, but they're already revving up to do all that  Fonzie happy day stuff.  What was the line?  Instead of Hitler left, he would have destroyed the smiley face.  That guy didn't laugh. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, but it was, the timing was bad, man.  That's how it went.  Because everyone was revving up for the happy day stuff.  I was listening to the show, like, on driving.  Thanks, Jeff.  The CBS show, and everybody was talking about how Opie was in the helicopter, and like,  oh, man.  Yeah.  Come on.  And I was just driving.  But that's, right there, like, you don't realize, like, what he just said is so subtle.  Yes.  Why he's important is because what he just said now is like, they're after.  Fuck, I was cooked.  Why y'all was revving up?  Reven up.  Like, it's just, it's just certain things. 
[02:47:00]  Like, I threw it in there bad timing because he was revving up on the anti-Semitic Fonzie.  And how do you top anti-Semitic Fonzie?  Right.  My line, no one's going to remember my line by the end of the day.  I'm like, it was a horrible placement.  Horrible placement.  And I knew it, too.  I'm like, ah, man, this is going to be, the Fonzie Happy Days thing is going to kill.  I see what he does.  Like, he wants to go, he goes, all right, we're going to go to, um, all right, we're  going to go to this great story about a fish with feet.  And then it's like, anti-Semitic Fonzie, and you can see him just hit a pen and go, 
[02:47:30]  okay, go ahead, do the fucking Jew Fonzie shit, motherfuckers.  That stuff killed and just destroyed my one-two line for the day.  Why don't we take a break is what we need to do.  All righty.  Hey, you know, we try to start this the last couple days.  I got in front of me the worst sequels of all time.  This is going to be good.  And Patrice is in, he loves movies.  What do you think is the worst, uh, sequel of all time?  Don't give it away, though.  Fuck!  The worst sequel of all time?  I will give it away.  Let's go around the room. 
[02:48:00]  What do you think, Patrice?  Anthony, Jimmy?  Personally, I know it's not on the list, right?  But I know the worst sequel ever was Caddyshack 2.  Because Caddyshack was a great movie.  Caddyshack 2 is the worst movie.  Uh, what do you mean?  Is it only two?  I don't know, like three, like Godfather 3.  Because Jaws 4.  Oh, horrid.  It's the worst fucking any movie ever.  No, it's personal.  They do go further than two.  Oklahoma.  Like Godfather 3 is on the list.  That's not it.  Okay, okay, okay. 
[02:48:30]  So we'll get into the worst sequels of all time after the break.  How about, um, Clockwork Orange 3?  Let's see that one.  Clockwork Blue.  Clockwork Jew.  Fonzie's favorite movie.  Hey.  Fucking Fonzie destroyed my line.  You can't top Jew-hater Fonzie.  I understand that.  Oy vey.  The rest of the room didn't even have time to laugh because, boom, he was right into it on my eye.  The oven doesn't work. 
[02:49:00]  You bang it.  Hey, Fonzie, why you got on that big hat and that long, long trench leather coat?  See, I got my leather on.  Hey.  Drives his motorcycle with a sidecar in it.  Absolutely.  Those are the exact words that were in my head, cocksucker.  He pulled out a square gun with a little skinny.  With the little, with that little, the little, the little, the Luger.  Hey.  Hey, I got a Luger.  Hey.  Luger.  I don't even know her.  Hey.  Chris from Brooklyn. 
[02:49:30]  Chris?  Yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  All right.  Yes.  I just wanted to call, because everybody from Pal Talk wanted to wish Doug out Doug a happy  birthday.  And we wanted to call you yesterday, Opie, and we tried, but they said it was too late  and we couldn't get a hold of you.  So happy belated birthday from everybody from Pal Talk.  Yeah.  Believe it or not, I appreciate all the birthday wishes on all the fan sites.  It was pretty awesome, man.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Everybody loves you here.  No joke there.  That was just cool, man.  Doug out Doug's birthday today.  Happy birthday, Doug. 
[02:50:00]  That's all I got.  Punch it out, guys.  Also, my niece is celebrating a birthday down there in Winter Park, Florida.  And my brother-in-law listens every day, so.  Oh, happy birthday.  Wish Kel Bell a happy birthday for me.  All right?  All right.  Happy birthday.  We'll do the sequel thing next.  Stay there.  With the Mountain Wednesday.  It's crazy.  Sure, the Mountain Wednesday.  This is what it's all about.  With the Mountain Wednesday.  Oh, I love this.  Sure, the Mountain Wednesday.  Wow. 
[02:50:30]  He showed 36 double-Ds.  He showed 36 double-Ds.  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double-Ds.  He showed 36 double-Ds.  Oh, wow.  He just looks hurt now.  He just looks hurt now.  Anywhere.  With the Mountain Wednesday.  She'll flash.  She'll flash.  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash.  And there's boobs in his face.  I'm all for it.  This is what it's all about. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, I loved it.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Whip them fuckers out.  This is fantastic. 
[02:51:30]  Wow, this is wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  That's why we call it wow.  Talk about the boobies.  Take your frog and take it off now.  That's why we call it wow.  That's why we call it wow. 
[02:52:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:52:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:53:00]  New York 1-0-0-1-9.  Just write XM on that puppy and wow sticker or something like that, okay?  We'll set up the wow stickers.  I think we have wow stickers in finally.  I'm not sure.  People are writing in with their worst movie sequels, so they're going to be pissed if we don't get to it.  Oh, we're doing it in two seconds.  I just want to acknowledge something.  I was just watching TV during the break, and Bob Dylan, it's his birthday today? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  65.  Really?  Bob Dylan is 65 years old.  1940, happy days.  1941, happy days.  42, happy days.  Happier days.  Spend a time killing Jews.  The brown skirts come.  We're having fun.  1942.  Ready to get some Jews.  Better days.  Better days.  I'll never get past the anti-Semitic happy days. 
[02:54:00]  This art is art.  He took from me.  Let's get into the sequels.  The worst sequels of all time.  Godfather 2.  And then they also have the ten best sequels.  Ah, best sequel definitely is Aliens.  Aliens is great.  That's got to be right up there.  We have to say, now, here's the qualifications, though.  Yeah.  Sequel to the movie.  Not just like, oh, a great fucking movie, but to the original film, it's like Aliens. 
[02:54:30]  Alien was a great movie, but fucking Aliens took that movie to a fucking whole nother level.  Kicked ass.  Well, Patrice, it made the list.  The ten best sequels of all time.  Aliens in fourth place.  Godfather 2 has to be one.  Yeah.  Number one.  We can't even tease that.  Godfather 2 was the greatest sequel ever made.  I bet you somebody would say Jaws 2 is a bad sequel, but I think, I love Jaws 2. 
[02:55:00]  Jaws 2 was awful compared to Jaws 1.  Compared to Jaws 1, but it still was a good sequel.  Oh, the dopey kids.  Jaws 3 and 4 have to be in the top ten worst.  You know what the thing is, too?  Jaws.  I didn't mind Jaws 2.  I like Jaws 2.  I didn't mind it.  Even though the special effects are cheesy and stuff in the first Jaws, you could watch  it and it still holds up.  The characters still hold up.  Mm-hmm.  You watch Jaws 2, you know you're watching a fucking seventies movie with those kids with 
[02:55:30]  their groovy, hippie haircuts.  But it's pretty good.  You know what keeps that together, Jaws 2?  What?  Brody.  Brody's still.  He's like, look, I've been through that hell before and I'm not gonna fucking go through  it again.  Look at the eye.  And the stupid.  But the same mayor, fucked up mayor guy.  He still doesn't want to accept.  He's like, all right, Jaws.  Now, now.  Remember the nigga that signed the thing?  He went.  My son was in the water, too.  Right.  And very next movie, he's like, all right, Jaws.  We're gonna go back and talk about it. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah.  You sit here.  And they come back and fire on him.  The same guy.  The same guy.  Amnesia.  Yeah, what did he forget?  It's like, what's the fucking stupid thing?  Was it suspension of disbelief?  Yeah.  It's like, you cocksucker, you're now, your son was out in the water, almost getting eaten  by a shark, but the second movie, Brody's a dick again.  He had to answer to his cronies.  It was a worse asshole than him.  Yeah, the guy that was looking for Marlena on Days of Our Lives.  Now, would you say, Superman 2 was a great fucking scene. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, Superman 2.  Zod.  Oh, kneel before Zod.  Kneel before Zod.  That was good.  I love the leg in Jaws, too.  They just pan to the leg, falling with the sneakers still on us.  No, that's one.  That's stupid ass.  Is that one?  Are your kids okay over there?  Yeah, that was the one in the, he was in the, uh.  In the lake, the old lady pond.  Oh, you're right.  That was one.  Yeah.  Superman 2 did not make the top 10 best sequels of all time.  Really?  It didn't.  It didn't make the worst.  Superman 4.  3.  Well, we'll go to the worst in a minute, because I don't know where that crap is. 
[02:57:00]  Best?  Let's think.  Try to get a couple more.  Godfather 2.  Yeah, bet.  Aliens.  Aliens.  Aliens, yeah.  Oh, Terminator.  Yeah, man.  Absolutely.  Terminator 2.  Terminator 2.  T2.  T2.  Has to be.  Come on, liquid guy.  Yeah, liquid Terminator.  Judgment Day.  Judgment Day.  Yes.  Judgment Day.  Yes.  Number 7.  Number 7?  Mm-hmm.  Wow, there's better ones than that?  Um.  Bridges of Madison County have a sequel?  There's probably two you really should guess.  It's called Philadelphia. 
[02:57:30]  There's two you really should get.  Then there's one that people don't realize is a sequel.  That probably just gave that away.  Oh, well, we got to have Star Wars, must be.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, there you go.  All right.  Return of the Jedi.  Have I never seen a movie before?  You can't.  That's a serial.  Number 2 is, um.  Nah, Jedi.  Empire's better than Jedi.  Empire Strikes Back is the second greatest sequel of all time.  To Godfather 2.  Yep.  Yeah, that's fair.  Yeah, Jedi's pretty good.  Um, I gave one away by saying, uh, most people don't realize it's a sequel. 
[02:58:00]  But, uh, Empire's the best.  Wait, I don't, I want to know which ones.  Because Jedi had the goddamn Ewoks and that moved it for me.  They stunk.  Ruined it.  Little faggots.  Hold on a minute.  Rub it.  Fucking George Lucas and his weak chin.  Pat from Winaki.  He's one for one.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Pat.  Let's see what happens now.  Uh, anti-Semitic Jaws.  I'm not going to cut open that truck and have all those Jews fall over the dock.  And we're going to need a bigger oven.  We're going to need a bigger oven. 
[02:58:30]  Saved you.  He bombed.  No!  We're going to need a bigger oven.  It's really anti-Semitic Jaws.  Anti-Semitic Jaws.  When you want to take the gold out of his teeth, smile, you son of a bitch.  Ah, you see this right here?  That scar?  Wait a minute.  You got a scar?  The Jews are supposed to have a scar.  You can't be buried in a fucking Jew burial ground.  No.  You marked your body up, you fucking kike.  No, he goes, look at my number.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:59:00]  Let me read you this number.  The date?  1996.  I was on a cruise at an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Trying to get all I could eat.  The glass broke.  Cut me right here.  Those Jews.  I'll never eat at a buffet again.  They got black eyes.  Good food.  Plenty of it.  Like those Nazis.  Like a doll's eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  Hitler got a black mustache. 
[02:59:30]  He can't go under.  Not with three yarmulkes on.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Tim on Long Island.  Tim, what's up?  You guys stole my thunder.  I was going to say Empire Strikes Back.  So, I got nothing.  Punching out.  Okay.  Yeah, that was the runner-up best sequel of all time.  Wait a minute.  Want to take a stab at some of the...  Give us a couple of genres that they have.  I gave the one hint.  Oh, come on.  Okay.  Road Warrior. 
[03:00:00]  There you go.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Which one?  From Mad Max.  It was the original.  Lethal Weapon 2?  No.  That was a great sequel.  Road Warrior is number five.  Yeah.  I suck.  So, we got the top five.  We want to get out of here.  We got the top five except for one.  Godfather first.  Empire Strikes Back second.  Aliens 4.  Road Warrior.  Uh, Warrior.  Excuse me.  Uh, five.  A movie no one gave a shit about before Sunset came in sixth place.  What?  That was, uh, Ethan Hawke.  Oh, stop it.  And Julie Delpy. 
[03:00:30]  Too cool for the room.  Ass wipe.  What's that sequel to?  Shut up.  Who knows?  It stinks.  Before Sunrise was the original and then Before Sunset.  Yuck.  Like, they meet in Paris or something and now it's 20 years later and they meet again  or something like that.  No one cares.  Unless they both have the him.  No one gave a shit.  How about Batman Begins?  Terminator 2 was in seventh.  X-2?  X-Men.  Oh, X-Men 2 was pretty good, but I don't think it made the list.  You want eight?  Spider-Man 2.  We probably should have got this one.  Star Trek.  The Wrath of Khan.  Oh, Wrath of Khan.  That was a good one.  Come on.  That was, and because the first Star Trek kind of blew, but it was kind of cool because 
[03:01:00]  it was the first movie.  Number nine.  I didn't know this was a sequel.  For a Few Dollars More?  Yeah, Fistful of Dollars.  But it really wasn't.  It was the first one.  To what?  To Fistful of Dollars.  Oh.  It was the first one and then A Few Dollars More was the sequel.  But how can you tell all the Clint Eastwood movies look like the same movie?  Him and Lee Van Cleef was just them running around.  Close-ups on their eyes before they shoot each other.  It's the same movie.  Remember the anti-Semitic Clint Eastwood movie? 
[03:01:30]  The Outlaw Jusie Whale.  In 10th place, the...  The good, the bad, and the Jewish.  10th place, as far as great sequels go, is Toy Story 2.  Another one, whatever.  Didn't think about those.  But the one we missed here, in third place, The Silence of the Lambs.  No, that's...  You know what that...  That's a sequel to the book.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Manhunter was the original movie, but it was a TV movie. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, well, I guess there's an original movie.  But that's what I'm saying.  Like, most people don't realize that's technically a sequel to Manhunter.  It's a prequel, really.  Ah, they can suck it.  That's bullshit.  So that came in third place.  That's tricky.  So there you go.  There's some of the top 10 greatest sequels of all time.  Now we go to the worst sequels of all time.  And what are they...  Like, are they...  What's the criteria on, like, how bad...  Like, is it, like...  It's no criteria.  I think...  Meaning, was it something that was good, and then they made something really shitty?  I think the first one has to be pretty good. 
[03:02:30]  For the sequel to make the bad place.  Yeah, that's kind of a bad movie.  Godfather 3, it's got to be number one.  Godfather 3 is in 20th place.  Wow.  In the top 25.  I say number one is Caddyshack 2.  No.  It's horrible.  Let's go to Leroy in Pennsylvania.  Leroy.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hi.  Hey, how about Speed 2?  Wow, that has to be up there.  It's got to be the worst.  Bad one.  I saw that on TV the other day, and I was laughing, because you were the one that turned us  on to how bad the dialogue is in Speed 2, right, Patrice? 
[03:03:00]  Awful.  I'm trying to see if it's even on the list here.  Speed 2 has to be in there.  Rocky 4 or Rocky 5 should be in there.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Rocky 5 was one of the worst sequels of all time.  All right.  You want to go over some of these, or what?  We do.  Okay.  Smokey and the Bandit 3.  Yep.  Horrible.  That wouldn't be a nitto.  Horrible.  Burt Reynolds wasn't even in it.  Jerry Reed and the Bandit.  Jerry Reed dressed up like Burt Reynolds, trying to fool Jackie Gleason.  And trying to fool the audience into thinking he has a personality. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  Why would Jackie Gleason take that part, you think?  Money.  He's old.  Oh, money.  He was just old and said, what the hell?  I don't think he was making royalties off of Honeymooners episodes.  All right.  No, no.  Joyce Randolph is the only one that made them because her brother was a lawyer.  That's what I heard.  Really?  Yeah.  I heard she was the only one that had any kind of foresight.  Jew lawyer?  Jew lawyer.  That's what the new Clint Eastwood movie is.  It's about a Jew lawyer for a few dollars more.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.  All right.  We'll run down.  It's full of pennies.  We'll run down the list fast, and then we'll get to the top ten and have some fun.  All right? 
[03:04:00]  25th place, The Matrix Reloaded.  I don't know.  That was a bad one, though.  I like all the Matrix movies.  You like it because it's sewed up the books.  I like them all.  The goddamn battle scene when they come through the roof of the thing with the friggin' things  and the machine gunners and stuff is worth the price right there.  That was a great battle scene in that movie.  Mr. Anderson.  Mr. Anderson.  Uh, 24th.  You take out your neighbor's garbage. 
[03:04:30]  He was great in the first one.  I like that guy.  That voice is creepy, right?  You can go through, Mr. Anderson.  Uh, 24th place, who cares, The Next Karate Kid.  Uh.  That was with the girl.  Yeah, with the girl.  Very good.  God, you do watch a lot of movies, man.  Yeah.  Why would you ever watch The Next Karate Kid?  I just, I just watch bad movies.  I just gotta, I gotta think for them.  23, uh, Porky's 2, The Next Day.  Yeah, horrid.  Absolutely horrendous, right?  But Porky's 1 wasn't that fuckin' fantastic anyway. 
[03:05:00]  Well, it just doesn't hold up.  At the time it was, but now you'll be like, some of these movies just don't hold up.  That's the problem.  Pork Eater's 1.  With Mrs. Anderson.  Pork.  Alright, we see what this bitch gonna be.  Bitch, day.  The anti-Semitic, the anti-Semitic top 25 worst people of all time.  What was it, was 25?  Uh, The Matrix Reloaded.  Okay.  Uh, 22.  22, Teen Wolf 2, oh, spelled T-O-O.  Teen Wolf wasn't something that made a difference. 
[03:05:30]  Like, Teen Wolf wasn't good enough to have a bad sequel.  You know something, back, back, when it came out, Michael J. Fox was in it, he was very  big then, uh, it was a big movie.  Yeah.  It was kinda like a big teen movie.  Teen 2, was that, was that, was that, was that, was that P.S.?  Or, or, or.  It was Teen.  Was that P.S. or, or, or A.S.?  What's that?  Uh, P, uh, P.G.?  Pre-Shake.  Oh, yeah.  He wasn't in it.  They thought the wolf had fleas on him all the time.  Look at the silence, he was like, this better be good. 
[03:06:00]  Or this pre-shake, or after-shake.  Everybody's like, oh, brrrrrr.  Is the car crash coming?  That's pretty funny, man.  Is he, is he wet again?  He's always shaking.  He's shaking water off himself.  No.  Uh, Jason Bateman was in Teen Wolf 2.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  He's good.  All right.  Just fantastic.  Uh, 21st place, worst sequels of all time, Legally Blonde 2, Red, White, and Blonde.  What was Legally Blonde 1?  Yeah, see, that's animated because Legally Blonde 1 doesn't really rate as a movie. 
[03:06:30]  Legally Blonde was a huge movie.  Ah.  I mean, it was more of a trick play, but it was a huge movie.  Legally Blonde was huge in terms of, I don't, it, ugh.  20th place, we already said it, Godfather 3.  I can't believe that's not higher.  I know.  That was, that was disastrous.  Horrid.  Like, how, they, they, they, leave it alone.  They destroyed.  Yeah.  A fucking, uh, institution with that.  Yeah, I don't even acknowledge it exists.  I watched one, I watched two.  I tell you, Batman Begins.  Yeah.  Fucking brought, but that's, your black guys loved the Batman movies. 
[03:07:00]  Wait a minute, Bat, no, no, no.  Batman Begins, the, the, the new Batman was unbelievable.  Let me tell you something, that rinsed off.  That was great.  All the other Batman.  You forgot about all the, all the ones that came before.  It, it rinsed, it, I see that again, I've seen it five times in the last two days.  Because I've seen it once.  It's really good, huh?  Great.  It's amazing.  All they did was add.  Liam Neeson was amazing in that.  Fuck everybody.  The fact is, when you grow, when you grow up watching Batman, everybody grow up watching Batman, 
[03:07:30]  right?  Though, it, the, why the movie was so great, simply.  It's because they took away, again, they made it like, holy shit.  They just added Morgan Freeman.  Mm-hmm.  And, and it, and it answered every fucking question that when you was a kid.  And you're like, wait a minute, who the fuck built the Batcave?  It was almost like the 9-11 shit where, all right, you got, there's a lot of secrets up in this motherfucker.  So who, who built the little thing that falls down in the Batman, in the thing where the, 
[03:08:00]  Right, the Batmobile comes up.  Who built the Batpole?  Uh-huh.  Who, uh, uh, how do you, all these, these gadgets, all this fucking.  Yeah, where'd they come from?  It, it, it, the fact that this motherfucker just added one character.  Who was Morgan Freeman in it?  Did he narrate it?  No.  He was in the, uh.  He's the guy who invented the shit.  The lab, yeah.  It's like, Batman's suit was all these, it was all these, uh.  Military contracts that they got money for that the military didn't take, but, you know.  Holy shit.  Some of them were. 
[03:08:30]  And he took them, yeah.  This, it's the, okay, are you into the superhero movies or the.  Ah, here and there.  A little bit?  Yeah.  That, that might be the best fucking super, ever.  Other, very close to the original Superman with Chris Marie.  They took the cartoon angle out of it, too.  It was genius.  It's just a very dark movie.  Original Superman doesn't hold up.  That's why the new one's coming out.  No, it does.  The original Spider-Man was great.  The effects, though, now you watch it and it's like, I can't get past the bad special effects. 
[03:09:00]  No, man.  That fucking movie stands up.  This new one's gonna be good.  The new one, I like, uh, the trailer.  I want to see that one.  Really looks like it's gonna be a good movie.  Because it's, they took out, they took out the, the bullshit.  Like, when they show, like, the scenes or the people going, there's a motherfucker flying.  And they, and they're dead serious.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, nobody would be like, holy shit.  Like, in the old school ones, guy be reading the paper and the paper fly out and go, what the fuck is that?  You know, everybody's like, holy shit, there's a dude in the air flying. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, there's a guy, and he's flying.  Flying.  Like, how you would react.  How you would really react, right.  It would, that, oh, man.  By the way, the Spider-Man, the Superman, the Batman movie with Halle Berry is the Catwoman.  Whatever, which one that one was?  No, that was Catwoman.  Oh, you're right.  Man, if that was a sequel, that was the, one of the worst movies ever.  The Michelle, the Michelle Pfeiffer Catwoman was Batman, whatever.  That's gotta be one of the worst ones.  That's, I'm Halle Berry.  One of the Batmans is probably in this, in this top worst.  It has to be.  Uh, is it? 
[03:10:00]  The one with, with Swartzenegger, the one they just said.  The Clooney one.  They collected every famous person.  I'm Mr. Freeze.  Victor Freeze.  I'm, I'm, I'm Victor Brown.  I am Mr. Freeze.  Vic Brown.  Vic, Vic Brown.  I, I'm Morgan Freeman.  Mr. Freeze.  Is Batman Begins in that?  No.  No Batman movies made.  No Batman.  None, not even.  There's a bunch of movies that should have made it that didn't make it. 
[03:10:30]  But, uh, let's move on here.  So, uh, Godfather.  Okay, 19th place, Revenge of the Nerds 2.  Nerds in Paradise.  All right, that was bad.  Well, the Nerds movie was very popular.  Yeah, it was.  They go to, on spring break, I guess, in that one.  Weekend at Bernie's 2 has got to be in there.  Weekend at Bernie's 2.  It couldn't be.  Did I miss it?  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Uh, worst sequels of all time.  Number five.  Thank you, E-Rock, Batman, and Robin.  Uh, 1997.  Uh, George Clooney.  Clooney. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze.  Yeah, that's true.  I'm so good.  Uma Kerman as, as, as, they just, they just.  Yeah, I missed that.  It's in fifth place.  I'm so glad it didn't work when they tried to put a different Batman every time.  Fucking assholes.  Well, what's his name playing the Batman, uh, in Batman Returns?  Uh, dude from American Psycho.  Forget his freaking name.  Michael Bale?  Michael Bale.  Christian Bale.  Christian Bale.  Christian Bale.  Christian Bale.  Unbelievable.  Uh, 18th place.  Worst sequels of all time.  Battle for the Planet of the Apes.  Uh.  I loved all the, uh, Planet of the Apes. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, me too.  Ah, no.  That was.  Is this the one where they had the bad costumes?  No.  That's the one where they were fighting.  They had conquered.  Cause, cause, uh, conquered battle.  Wait, um.  What's the one?  There was, there was Planet of the Apes.  It was Planet of the Apes.  Then there's Beneath the Planet of the Apes.  Beneath the Planet of the Apes was the third one.  That was the second one.  Beneath.  Yes, that was the one where Charlton Heston was taking, they took the place.  He died.  He was in it for eight seconds.  Yeah.  And they killed the motherfucker.  And then, uh, Tony Franciosa, uh, was the guy that shot, uh, uh, he was the other 
[03:12:00]  guy.  How the hell do you know his name?  That went to get, uh.  How the hell do you know his name?  I would just say some dude that kind of looks like Charlton Heston.  Dude, Tony Franciosa or James Franciscus.  But he was, he was, he was big back then, though, that guy.  Yeah.  He was in a lot of those goofy movies back then.  He was in Long Street.  He was.  Playing a blind detective.  That was the homeless Charlton Heston.  Like, if you couldn't get Charlton.  Yeah, you got him.  He wouldn't be, he wouldn't be in Ten Commandments.  He wouldn't be in Seven Commandments.  Then there was the Planet of the Apes where Cornelius and, uh, uh, what's his name? 
[03:12:30]  Zira, what's her name?  Zira, uh, somehow got the ship to work, flew, went back in time.  That?  And that was the one.  There's five.  There was five of them.  Oh, yeah.  And then there was, and then there was Conquest for the Planet of the Apes.  Conquest was the best one.  That was the one where the Apes, uh, rose up.  Rose up.  And Cornelius.  Is it Planet of the Apes Vegas Vacation?  Viva, Viva Los Apes.  Where, where, where Stephen Baldwin played, uh, Cornelius.  Planet of the Apes Part Deux. 
[03:13:00]  God, there's 11 listed here.  Yeah, but some of them were TV, uh, movies.  Yeah, a bunch of TV.  What's the one where the, where the, it was after Conquer was the worst one.  That's the one that's, it was Conquer.  Conquest and Battle, Battle for.  It was the anti-Semitic one.  Planet of the Apes.  There was Battle for the Planet of the Apes.  Which was the, the, the one you're saying was the bad one.  And, and Conquest, I'm not sure of the, uh, order.  Battle was the one where the, the humans, uh, every, every, every, every futuristic movie 
[03:13:30]  back then, the humans had some kind of, the, fucked up, deformed, native scar.  Yeah.  No, there was a Planet of the Apes though.  They, they ran out of money, so they couldn't get the really good makeup.  Yeah, so it was just masks and people in the background.  Yeah, people in the background had just masks on.  That was, that was Battle.  No, that was Planet of the Apes 2, Electric Boogaloo.  That's Planet of the Apes.  So, uh, Battle for the Planet of the Apes in 18th Place, worst sequels of all time.  Or the French version, Planet of the Crips.  Where all the, where everybody was burned, all the Jews were burned by, they were acidity, 
[03:14:00]  acidity Jews.  Oh, Jesus.  Jesus.  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, dear Lord, indeed.  Let's move on.  17th place.  17th.  Worst sequels of all time, Star Trek V, The Final Frontier.  Eh, I kind of, I think any of the Star Trek movies are pretty good.  That was the one with the, with the, uh, whales. 
[03:14:30]  What, what, The Final Frontier?  Yeah.  No, that was, uh, hmm?  Spock's half-brother.  Spock's half-brother?  Spock's half-brother.  Uh, what was the basic gist of the storyline?  Which one was the one with the one with the one?  Trek V is...  Final Frontier was with the, the piece between the Klingon, right?  Was that the one with the next one?  Oh, Trek V is an, uh, an oil slick of spiritual hooey in which Kirk meets God face-to-face,  then sasses and back talks him. 
[03:15:00]  What?  Then sasses and back talks him.  He yells at God.  In an irony, probably lost on the hubristic, hair-pieced, auteur, God looks like, atheist,  Karl Marx.  All right.  Whatever.  Uh, 16th place, Ocean's 12.  What?  I, I don't mind that movie, though.  Like, I wouldn't call it the fucking worst.  And, and Ocean's 11, what that was, it was kind of just...  It was as good as, or as bad as Ocean's 11.  It takes you an hour to know if you're watching Ocean's 11 or Ocean's 12 when it comes on TV. 
[03:15:30]  It was triton nonsense.  It's the same fucking movie.  Uh, 15th place, Dumb and Dumber, when Harry met Lloyd.  Oh, when, when the one, neither, they were young kids.  It was a miracle.  Terrible.  Masked 2.  Oh, the one with your boy.  Uh, oh, I thought you meant the other one, Masked movie.  Have you ever had a show?  Masked 2, pulling the thumbtacks out of the map.  Have you had Jamie Kinney on a show, Opie?  Huh?  Is it Jamie Kinney?  Have you been on?  Yeah, last week.  Yeah, last week.  Oh, was he really?  Yeah. 
[03:16:00]  Masked 2, my coffin shaped like a lollipop.  Masked 2, you six kids, stop playing in my hat.  Masked 2, I want to put on makeup, hand me that paint roller.  Me, I'd have been Masked 2, pinless map.  Fucking Ben takes the pins out of our own Ben.  He takes, put them in Boston.  Sean plays where he scored coke. 
[03:16:30]  Right here on that, Cambridge Street.  Jesus Christ.  Why would you call out his coke problem right now?  Can't help him.  Why not?  What is that, your intervention?  No, it's just the way he moves has to be explained.  14th place, worst sequels of all time, a movie that starred Will Chamberlain.  Oh, I like Conan the Destroyer, man.  Conan the Destroyer.  I like that movie.  Yeah, any of the Conan movies are good.  I enjoyed Conan the Destroyer.  I did.  Conan the Destroyer.  Conan the Destroyer. 
[03:17:00]  13th place, worst sequels of all time, The Sting 2.  With, uh, that one was with, uh, Tom Cruise.  Say it.  No.  Say it.  No, that was the other one.  George Segal or Money.  Say it.  Who was in Sting 2?  Say it.  Paul Newman.  Nah.  Fred Gwynn.  Say it.  Peter Gabriel.  Sting 2.  They're screaming at their radios out there.  They got it.  Say it.  Denzel Washington.  Say it.  Sting 2. 
[03:17:30]  Paul Benjamin.  Who was the bad guy?  I know Jackie Gleason was the bad guy in Sting 2.  Jackie Gleason.  Jackie Gleason's in that, yes.  And, uh, well, Mac Davis.  Mac Davis?  Jesus.  But who was the Sting?  Burt Reynolds?  Who did the Sting?  Who didn't the...  The Sting was, uh, Paul Newman?  Paul Newman, yeah.  No, the Sting 2.  Who was the...  Robert Redford.  No, who did the...  Who did the Sting?  Who pulled off the job in 2?  I don't know.  Fuck.  All right, whatever.  Sting 2.  No idea.  All right, uh, 12th place. 
[03:18:00]  12th.  Star Wars Episode 1, The Phantom Menace.  Fucking awful.  That whole thing is awful.  With Jar Jar.  I hate it.  Jar Jar Binks again.  Jar Jar Binks.  Another reason I want to smack George Lucas right in his fat face.  Horrid.  I hate it.  Cornball.  I hate it all three of those movies.  He's a cornball.  All three of those.  Jar Jar Binks.  They're writing it to the kids.  He made a kiddie movie.  Yeah.  Fucking hate it.  And you know what sucks?  The potential there during that speeder race was so good.  Like, the effects on that and the sound. 
[03:18:30]  Sitting in the theater as they're going around with the speeders and stuff.  It was great.  But the whole premise of it's dopey little kid movie.  The fucking possibilities for the entire...  Did you see the last one?  Yeah.  You happen to see it?  Yeah.  And let me tell you what made me want to throw up that I waited this long.  Whining Darth Vader.  Is at the end when she gave birth to the Leia and fucking...  Yeah.  And how they're born and he goes...  The motherfucker goes, this one is called Luke. 
[03:19:00]  Luke.  I said, the motherfucker, give me the...  Wait, he goes, you shall be...  Like, people were being named for nothing.  You shall be Darth Vader.  I'm out.  What?  Nigga, give me the background on why.  That's what I was waiting for.  This one is Luke.  Oh, and here's a girl.  You are Leia.  And we're out.  What the fuck?  It's true. 
[03:19:30]  Like, it was no...  It was no reason.  Yeah.  It was no reason.  It was like that stupid movie about the hurricane, how the weather went bad, Day After Tomorrow.  Day After Tomorrow.  They wrote a movie around the weather.  Like, they said, wow, this would be great to have a tornado in Newark.  And then they just wrote a nigga going, oh shit, a tornado.  They didn't write the fucking movie.  So, it's almost like he had Darth Vader be in this movie just because he had to. 
[03:20:00]  Because Darth...  But how can you...  He just diminished the entire...  What Darth Vader meant.  And the whole thing, it was bad.  Bad shit.  It was horrible.  Yeah, Darth Vader was like the shit in the first Star Wars that came out.  Like, he was the bad guy.  Kill him.  Okay.  Like, kill the children.  All right, I'm in there.  What?  Did you just kill all the kids?  Yes, because that's Darth Vader, baby. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  And everybody had a lightsaber.  Everybody.  Little kids.  It was...  That ruin, that whole adventure destroyed that shit for me.  I hate Star Wars now.  Well, don't worry because you can get now coming out the original Star Wars on DVD without his extra stuff in it.  Thank you.  For more money.  And who cares about his extra shit?  And Jabba the Hutt has a cigarette.  Yeah.  Oh, my G-Bub. 
[03:21:00]  Well, that's what they did.  Nice talking to you.  So now you can get it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  They took the cigarette out?  Are you serious?  No, but they did take some things out so it wouldn't look bad.  Yeah, they made Greedo, the bounty hunter, shoot first so Han wouldn't shoot first because Han wouldn't shoot.  It makes Han look bad by shooting first.  I fucking hate George Lucas.  He fucked up, man.  He's always been...  He lucked up on a couple of good scripts.  He's a cornball.  That's who he is.  That cantina scene. 
[03:21:30]  He should have been fucking executed for that.  How did that go?  That fucking faggot blue elephant.  Oh, here it is.  Here it is.  Play along, Jimmy.  Ah, the blue elephant.  He did fuck up.  You know the smartest thing he ever did, Lee?  Wait, I want to hear Jimmy.  That's all I had.  That fucking asshole elephant with a clarinet.  When you're head shaved, you almost look like one of the guys that played the horn. 
[03:22:00]  They don't want an afro he looks like.  He looked like something that got eaten in their head.  The eyes on stalks.  Hey, you heard the skinny?  Wow.  Shut up.  Fucking asshole.  Jimmy looks like he's floating around in the other space garbage.  You didn't find this all creative?  No, it's stumped.  You know, they're in a bar.  The old piano, the old one playing the piano.  Cut face. 
[03:22:30]  Do the solo again, please.  Cut face.  Cut face.  Cut face.  Cut face.  Cut face.  Fucking George Lucas and his fucking weak chin.  But you know how many comedians reference this in their acts?  Oh, it's so funny.  Oh, it's terrific when they reference this.  Wow.  All right.  That is really amazing.  The 11th.  Awful.  The 11th worst sequel of all time.  Before we take a break, then we'll do the top 10 for you guys.  Why don't we take a break on the 9th?  And it's a who cares movie.  That's why I just want to throw it out there before we take a break. 
[03:23:00]  God, Dirty Dancing, Havana Night.  It was a bad movie in its own right.  Like, some of these movies are, like, the other movie has nothing to do with it, and  you shouldn't even call it a, like, attach it as a sequel.  Yeah, it's not a sequel at all.  Staying Alive has got to be up there.  Staying Alive.  Saturday Night Fever and Staying Alive was not even a sequel.  But it was still...  It wasn't a sequel.  And the original is so much fun to watch.  Well...  Now you're a cunt.  Well, stick around to find out...  Hey, why don't you know?  ...the worst sequel of all time on The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[03:23:30]  I'm told...  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the bread.  Squeeze the bread.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  It's a hard piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive...  Yeah.  ...that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly good result.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  In case you didn't know...  ...that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly good result. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  George Lucas should be fucking kicking the balls.  Ewoks, you fucking fatso. 
[03:24:30]  Puppet show.  It was a fucking puppet show.  Oh, shoot.  George Lucas is making a deal.  No one.  No one's listening.  Is he?  What's that?  They can't hear you.  Good.  Turn down the music a little bit.  You might want to put the headphones on.  We still didn't hear you.  By the way, Patrice O'Neal is playing Carolines all weekend long here in New York City.  212-757-4100 for ticket info.  Starts tomorrow through Sunday, right?  Yes, sir.  All right.  Very good.  And we got details on Jimmy Day coming up soon.  I don't know.  Jimmy Day.  What? 
[03:25:00]  On his own special day.  Actually, we got the info here somewhere.  We'll do it a little later.  I got to cut a promo with Steve.  Let's all keep that under our hats.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I got some work to do with Steve, though, after the show.  You suck this cock.  You suck this cock?  I get to go home.  Home sweet.  Show me with your mouth.  That's right.  Home sweet.  Spit your matzah out.  I got to shit out more birthday cake.  Hold on.  I want to go home and watch the bad juke tenant. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, who is that?  No more farting.  Patrice, is that you?  No, I don't fart.  I don't fart.  No.  I'm shitting out complete pieces of cake at this point.  I'm not used to the sweets in my system.  You're sweet.  I'm not used to having a sour stomach from ice cream cake.  I want to pat it with a hammer.  Top 10 worst sequels of all time.  Let's go.  All right.  Number 10.  Yes, a Jaws movie made it.  Which one did three?  What?  Jaws 3.  Jaws 3D. 
[03:26:00]  Four.  Ooh.  Jaws the Revenge, 1987.  Jaws the Revenge.  That's when the shark ate the plane.  That was 87?  Mario Van Peebles.  The fucking, the mother was only, the shark killed everybody.  That was the one where it was personal.  In the Bahamas.  And yeah, the guy, everyone the guy knows is killed and he decides to fucking be like  a marine biologist.  And the mother winds up going out in a boat to get the shark.  You just move to the middle of the country.  Shark will never, ever, ever, ever get you.  Right, you could finally be done with that problem. 
[03:26:30]  Done with the fucking problem.  Move to Phoenix, please.  But no, she's got to get on a boat.  Right.  Well, and it's Jaws 4.  Horrid.  Jaws 4.  I guess they...  Jaws 3 was in 3D.  They point out that Michael Caine's in this movie and Michael Caine gets out of the water  in a wet shirt.  In the next shot, it's bone dry.  Oh, yeah, a lot of continuity problems.  So they didn't really pay attention to detail.  Care.  Or details.  All right, next.  Yeah, the Maneater follows Mrs. Brody to the Bahamas where Mario Van Peebles plays Rasta 
[03:27:00]  Mann, marine biologist, blah, blah, blah.  All right.  Anything he's in is just great.  I like him.  Ninth worst sequel of all time.  This movie was brought to my attention by Patrice O'Neill.  Speed 2.  Cruise control.  That's right.  Horrible.  Absolutely horrendous.  The one with the ship.  That goes through the entire island.  Yeah.  Kind of cuts right through town.  The entire town.  Wonderful.  That would happen.  Eighth place.  Worst sequels of all time.  Friday the 13th, part 8. 
[03:27:30]  How do they distinguish why 8 is any worse than...  Well, you know why?  It takes Manhattan.  Yes.  That was the one from New York.  That was the one where it got...  A little goofy.  It got campy.  It got goofy.  Because from 1 to 4 was great.  Part 4 was great when the kid killed him and his head slipped.  It was the end of Jason.  Then 5.  Which one was the machete going through the guy in the wheelchair's head?  Was that 2?  That was 2.  That was a good one.  That was 2.  1 was the mother.  Yeah.  2 was... 
[03:28:00]  Kill them.  Kill them, mommy.  The girl who lived it from 1.  She got stabbed in the head with a screwdriver.  Yeah.  Then 3 was 3D, but it was great because the girl got shot in the eye.  And that's when the hockey mask came.  Then 4, the little Corey Feldman.  Little Corey Feldman.  Chopped him in his head.  Killed Jason.  Corey Feldman killed Jason.  Yeah.  Final chapter.  But then 5 came back and...  How do you know this?  This is fantastic.  Wait a minute, so 5 was back.  Is he accurate?  Does anyone even know?  It's got to be.  It is.  I'm not questioning this. 
[03:28:30]  5 was...  5, it was...  Now they said, Jason's gone.  Yeah.  They tinkered around with other motherfuckers doing shit.  Doing Jason type shit.  It wasn't the girl.  Girl was 7.  5 was an ambulance driver.  Right.  And Dudley from...  Remember Dudley from Different Strokes?  Please tell me someone molested...  Jason molested Dudley.  He tried to.  In the bicycle shop or whatever it was.  Get in the pool.  Jason molested Dudley. 
[03:29:00]  6 was Jason lives.  He came back.  He killed Horshack.  Was his first victim.  Ron Palillo.  7 was a new beginning where he had a battle with a clairvoyant, Carrie-like woman.  Yes, motherfucker.  Yeah.  Don't point out.  7 was...  I'm amazed because he's close enough for my...  He's hitting it by the way.  7 was the one he fought the bitch with the magic powers.  Uh-huh.  And she was like flying electrical wires at him and he was like, oh shit, this bitch 
[03:29:30]  is bad.  She was making the floor go out and strangling him.  8 was New York where he punched the guy's head off on...  When the guy was an Olympic boxer, they was on the boat and he was an Olympic boxer and  the guy was punching him in a mask and he got so tired, he goes, all right, motherfucker,  take your bitch shot.  And Jason punched his head off.  Punched his head off.  Number 9 was a magical one where Jason, his spirit went into like a bug and would go into  people. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, and kind of Jason-ize them?  And Jason-ize them.  There was no Jason in that one.  It was just...  What about Hockey Mask?  Where did that come into play there?  Does everybody that got Jason-ized go out, the first thing they do is go to the sporting...  I don't think it was a Hockey Mask.  Gotta go to Moe's and they get a sporting...  Then 10 was Jason in Out of Space.  Jason X.  ...where he killed a motherfucker.  They froze him.  Right.  I saw that one.  And they found him and the bitch goes...  The bitch that was with him when they froze him...  Years later.  ...because she was...  He was getting ready to chop her up and she was like, ah!  They was all frozen. 
[03:30:30]  They unthawed her.  In the future.  And she said, hey man, don't unthaw him because his evil stretches through time.  So they...  What did they do?  They unthawed him.  He killed everybody.  And what happened is, in the future, when you had an injury, they had these little bugs that  put you back together.  Yeah.  And they fucked Jason up and he fell down and the bugs merged him with the ship and  him.  So he became robotic.  Robotic.  Jason.  And finally was Jason versus Freddy, what we've all been waiting for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And actually it was a good premise was Freddy was very angry about not getting credit for 
[03:31:00]  killing people.  What he did, he sent Jason in the real world to kill motherfuckers, right?  Right.  So they could be scared of Freddy again because everybody was taking pills so they didn't sleep.  Right.  And then he can't do anything.  He can't do nothing.  So what they would do is he pretended he was killing people again so people would get scared.  And then once people go, oh my God, Freddy's back again.  They said, fuck the pills. 
[03:31:30]  We're going to sleep.  Now Freddy gets you in the fucking thing.  In the thing.  But what was happening is Freddy got mad because Jason was killing motherfuckers before he could  get to the dream.  Yeah.  So he was like, you're taking my death, nigga.  And his whole, his whole, stealing his thunder.  You missed one.  You missed one.  You missed Friday the 13th, part 11, Jason cleans out the Warsaw Ghetto.  Patrice, how do you know all that? 
[03:32:00]  I don't, I don't.  That is amazing.  I was following along online.  He's pretty damn close.  I am amazed.  You're pretty damn close.  I am amazed.  Well, Friday the 13th, part 8 is the 8th worst sequel of all time.  And they talk about how this boat sinks off of Manhattan and the kids have to like swim  ashore to Manhattan.  And Jason swims after them.  And what's weird about that, he couldn't swim in part 1 and he died, right?  In the water.  Ah, right.  Jason wasn't a very good swimmer.  He wasn't a very good swimmer. 
[03:32:30]  No, but he didn't.  But he's a good swimmer in 8.  In 8, he walks.  He's like, you know, he just walks in the water.  And we don't get to Manhattan until the second hour.  And when we do, it looks a lot like Vancouver.  Ah, yeah.  Very good.  And you know, he meets all the New York people, you know, like a drug addict.  Or there's always a black guy who goes, man, that's a bad motherfucking mask.  Every fucking movie in New York, there's a dumb nigga who can't, nigga?  Where'd you get that machete, motherfucker? 
[03:33:00]  Where'd you get that from?  Always.  They just make us look like assholes.  Not paying attention to the fact that this guy is running around with a machete and a  hockey mask or anything like that.  It's like, damn.  Always a wino.  God damn.  It's always a wino.  Where'd you get them gloves with the knives on the fingers, nigga?  I must be sweet.  They did it in Superman. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, man.  There's some bad threads, nigga.  Where'd you get those super threads?  Every fucking movie, a nigga is impressed with somebody's costume.  All right.  Here we go.  Number seven.  Number seven.  All right.  Number seven.  Worst sequels of all time.  The Fly 2.  Yeah.  I guess Gina Davis.  The Fly is great.  Gina Davis was knocked out by Jeff Goldblum at the end of Fly 1, and this is their offspring.  Blah, blah, blah.  Fly was great.  First one.  I hated the Fly 2. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah.  God damn, I hated that movie.  What's scary is that you saw the Fly 2.  I saw it.  You see the Fly 2?  Yeah, I saw the Fly 2.  Fly 1 was so good.  They were doing experiments on the poor dog, and the dog was one of the fly creatures and  crawling around.  It's always sad when they bring the animals into it.  But then at the end, the evil, there's always an evil guy that's in control of Syntex  labs, and fucking, you know, he gets his comeuppance at the end.  Dude, we have to get to Cyberdyne Industries. 
[03:34:30]  My name is Bob Harrison.  Bob Harrison.  I work at Cyberdyne Industries.  Here's my card.  Here's my wife, Veronica.  Number...  Hold on.  Can I ask, Iraq, why are you sweating like a fucking Peruvian coffee picker?  And they do sweat.  That's the worst picture.  Wow.  God.  It's through two shirts.  Hold on.  What happened? 
[03:35:00]  It's through two shirts.  That camera...  Pick your arm up.  Pick it up.  It's through two shirts.  He's doing the Brad Pitt thing.  Get it on camera.  You keep...  No.  Wow.  Yeah, back up a little bit.  Back up so they can see...  Holy shit.  ...sweating through.  What's going on, man?  What's the matter?  I have no idea.  Nope.  Well, you're losing more weight, though.  That's a good sign.  That looks like a crotch of a kid that just got thrown into a van.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  What do you put on your...  It looks like the end of Ransom. 
[03:35:30]  What do you put on your...  What do you put on your cornflakes?  Hot sauce?  Hot sauce.  Wow.  You are a nervous nilly.  Oh, yeah.  You can't wear...  If you sweat like that, you have to wear dark shirts.  Wow.  That's a light green shirt.  That's crazy.  All right.  Number six.  Number six.  Worst sequels of all time.  Weekend at Bernie's 2.  I said that.  Yeah.  Weekend at Bernie's, again.  Not that, you know...  Yeah, not good enough to have it.  Nothing huge.  But it was a hit. 
[03:36:00]  It was kind of...  It was a big movie.  A lot of people referenced it.  Popular culture, so...  Thank you.  Let's go to John in Southampton.  John, what's up?  Hey.  How you doing?  Hey, Johnny.  Hey there, Jen.  All right.  I got a disgraceful one for you.  How about Slapshot 2?  I don't remember Slapshot 2.  Anyone?  No.  It's terrible.  It's one of those Baldwin brothers.  Slapshot 1 was Paul Newman, right?  Yeah.  Right.  That was a great film, right?  Yeah, the first one wasn't, but the second one had one of those Baldwin brothers in it.  It was terrible.  It made the Walmart bin, you know, the 499 one. 
[03:36:30]  Yeah, horrible.  You know, I love hockey, and I saw Slapshot recently.  I don't know if it holds up.  Don't hold up.  I wasn't that impressed by it, to be honest with you.  I know a lot of people love that movie.  Yeah.  Someone didn't slap the shot, too.  Does Animal House hold up?  Gary Busey and Stephen Baldwin.  There's a couple things that don't, but for the most part, Animal House kind of holds up.  Somebody's bringing up the fact that in Superman, the token black guy goes,  That is a bad outfit.  Woo! 
[03:37:00]  That's what they all do.  Right after he changes.  Every movie.  He goes, Excuse me.  Steps away and just flies away.  There's something there.  If you could help us out to keep this bit rolling, give us a call,  because that is in almost every movie.  Every movie.  Spider-Man and with the black man going,  Man, there's some, man, what?  There's no strings coming out of his hands.  It's always an impressive.  Some stupid statement.  What did Donnell Rollins say in Spider-Man 2?  He had some line.  People are also saying that Patrice is blowing out everybody's speakers. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, sorry, man.  That's all right.  I've been turning him down a little bit.  You just project.  When are you doing another Black Phillip?  Whenever.  I haven't talked to Logan.  I'm telling you.  I don't know where he's been.  He sent me an email.  There's so many lawsuits going on at XM.  I don't think he's slept in three weeks.  He sent me another email from some guy complaining about the show.  Can Elo not send me these things?  I don't care about the...  I care about our XM listeners. 
[03:38:00]  Believe me, I do.  Because the ones that understand and appreciate the show and know what's going on and everything are fine.  But he's sending me these one out of a million guys that are bitching about shit they don't know about.  And this guy left his name and phone number.  He'll be getting a call from me tonight.  I'm going to personally call him.  Why don't we call him on the air?  Can I call him?  Can you get the post from Anthony from yesterday?  That was hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  Some guy thought we had a really bad show yesterday. 
[03:38:30]  I say we did not have a really bad show yesterday.  It wasn't a really bad show.  It wasn't one of those shows where we leave high-fiving each other.  We've done a lot worse.  Yeah, believe me.  And Anthony just went off on this guy.  I've got to read your post.  What's the complaint?  What are most of the complaints?  Well, because the first half of the O.P. and Anthony show, it's on commercial radio.  So they're playing a lot of commercials.  So over here at XM, they're playing filler.  Okay?  So we're trying to get enough filler into the system so it doesn't get tired and old.  And I guess finally, starting Tuesday, even though we asked for this a long time ago, 
[03:39:00]  the show's going to be officially on steroids where they take out all the filler during the replay.  So you don't have to wait for live programming or that day's programming.  And then as soon as the CBS show ends, the XM show is going to begin.  And then as soon as the XM show ends, the CBS show is going to begin immediately.  And because of the system they had down in Washington, they had to throw like a half-hour,  40-minute filler in between shows, all sorts of dumb things were going on.  So a lot of people aren't mad at you guys. 
[03:39:30]  So I think Tuesday, it's going to be pretty good.  Calm down.  We'll have to listen and find out what the bugs are there.  Here's an email received from Patrick J. Henkel.  Yeah.  Mr. Henkel writes,  Patrick Henkel is a douche.  I have been an XM subscriber since March of 05.  And that was so I could have O&A back since I was a listener from back on Infinity.  Were you?  Can you explain to me after today how the CBS move is not a big F you to all of us on XM? 
[03:40:00]  You have taken two hours from us, and now we pay for tons of filler.  Then they go to XM and just seem to count the minutes until they can leave.  I don't see a signal benefit, a signal benefit, you idiot, to us XM subs.  I only see the O&A cash grab just like XM's.  I see you are daring us to cancel. 
[03:40:30]  Remember O&A, who was there 18 months ago, and who couldn't be bothered to buy XM?  Every terrestrial radio listener.  Thanks, Pat Henkel.  And Pat, again, this was yesterday.  He's pointing out yesterday's fucking show.  He's pointing out yesterday's XM show as the prime example of everything you get every day here on XM.  Well, if you weren't laughing your ass off today, take your radio, don't flush it down the toilet, sit on the toilet, shove it up your fucking ass, and shit it out, then eat it, and fuck your mother. 
[03:41:00]  Wow, wow, you changed it a little bit.  You're a busybody.  I can't stand motherfuckers like this.  Are people enjoying the CBS show?  Of course they are.  Are they upset with the CBS?  They were upset because it was something different, but I got to tell you, since we made this unbelievable deal, I think the show's never sounded better.  And believe me, Pat Henkel, we're getting emails from people.  I am getting, for every one Pat Henkel, I'm getting a hundred emails from people that are digging the show, from people that didn't, yes, didn't have satellite. 
[03:41:30]  That, that, or, I'm freaking out.  I want to know this.  That loves the show.  Yes, sir.  Yes, a combo.  Combo.  What do you think of this?  Combo.  Pat Henkel is full of tinkle.  Oh, very good.  The mask it is.  Yes, sir.  Are any, are there any emails where the XM subscribers are very happy with the situation?  Yes, yes.  There are people that like it.  They get more show. 
[03:42:00]  They're enjoying both parts of the show.  Yeah, plenty of them.  But then you get these idiots like this motherfucker who is basing everything.  Like he said, explain to me after today, because he wrote this yesterday, how the move is good.  They just sit there and, you know, count the minutes until they could leave.  We did that yesterday and it was a bit.  It was a bit.  Opie wanted out because it was his birthday and he had plans.  So we had planned weeks before, a week ago, it was planned that we were leaving on Opie's birthday at 11. 
[03:42:30]  So we didn't sit there counting the fucking minutes.  And the bit was, Opie left five minutes before 11 and me and Jimmy were joking that we were counting the minutes to leave.  It was a joke, Pat fucking Hinkle, you cunt.  How about, how do people get in touch with Pat J Hinkle?  Now I got to explain to the likes of a Pat Hinkle that that was a goof that we were literally counting the minutes to leave.  Can I explain further too?  You fucking, your mother's a cunt, Pat Hinkle.  That's right.  Pat J Hinkle.  I hope she gets fucking tit cancer. 
[03:43:00]  Hold on, you know what the J stands for?  Fuck Pat Hinkle.  Hold on, hold on.  Fuck Pat Hinkle.  Let me explain the other thing too because...  Fuck Pat Hinkle.  I hate that guy.  With this...  Maybe I got carried away.  With this new deal too, you know, we're allowed to go home right at 11.  Yeah.  Anthony and I and Jimmy, we decided, you know, people are a little wondering what's going to happen.  You know, it's a new thing.  So we took it upon ourselves to continue going after 11, giving him a little extra show, figuring,  you know, we got to give a little extra. 
[03:43:30]  We don't get paid starting at 11, right?  But...  Our guest.  Oh, I know.  We'll get to him in a second.  Oh, yeah.  He heard cunt four times.  He's okay.  I'm sorry, sir.  All right, listen.  So we didn't tell anybody and we were going to 11.30.  Hope there's been no tragedies in his family.  I forget.  Okay, so we go...  But we do.  We go longer.  I get started.  Especially at the beginning here.  I get started.  Hey, Obie, what's going on with Ron and Fett?  Obie, I think you need to...  Don't start another subject.  There's five on the table right now. 
[03:44:00]  Obie, I don't...  Holy shit.  Are you insane?  You know what?  People probably think we're joking.  I think...  I think...  Are you insane?  I'm trying to explain four.  Obie...  And you just added another one.  Obie, people probably think we're joking.  We're joking.  Now, I think...  All I'm saying is...  No, no, I think before you say it...  So people don't think we're joking.  I don't think Obie should be saying that.  I'm not stepping out of character.  I think you need...  No, no.  To step out of character.  No, I will not.  Because I take that very seriously when I step out of character. 
[03:44:30]  Well, then I'm not going to believe any of this.  My name is Greg Hughes.  And I'm an actor.  And I play a part called Obie on the Obie and Anthony show.  Right.  But I'm not doing that today.  So all I'm saying is...  So we started going 11.30.  Out of the kindness of our heart, knowing people are a little apprehensive about the  new deal we made.  So instead of people realizing that, they're like, look at these lazy fucks.  They're supposed to go to noon and they're leaving at 11.30. 
[03:45:00]  No, we're supposed to go home.  We're supposed to go home right now.  Because if we hit spots, it'll get us to 11.  Right.  Let's go.  We did that.  Let's go.  I know.  After all that, let's go.  It would be funny.  We should just leave.  At 10.58.  There you go, shit dicks.  There you go.  Blame it on Pat Hinkle.  But this is what's unbelievable to me.  We did that on our own.  Decided to just give them more show because people are apprehensive, like I said.  Yeah.  Instead, we get people yelling, screaming that we're lazy because we're not staying until  noon.  We don't have to stay until noon. 
[03:45:30]  Pat.  The channel stays open until noon.  Some days we might make it to noon.  Some days we're going to leave when we're supposed to, which is 11 a.m.  And as far as yesterday, for my birthday, I made a new thing with myself because I take  my personal life a lot more seriously these days.  I said to myself, I'm taking my birthday off every fucking year.  I did it last year.  Yeah.  I wanted to do it this year.  The only reason we didn't take off yesterday, because this is something I want personally, 
[03:46:00]  we all have things we want to do personally, was because we just started this new deal going  back to commercial radio.  So I'm like, wow, that would be a real dick move to take off my birthday.  Right.  But no one knows that.  And so now I feel like we have to yell and scream and tell the people what we're doing.  Hat.  Because these people on the message boards will just trash you.  We weren't supposed to work yesterday.  Remember O&M.  We get days off.  And I chose.  Who was there?  I chose.  If we get a certain amount of days off every year, you know what?  I want my birthday off.  It's just a personal thing I want. 
[03:46:30]  But I knew I couldn't do it yesterday.  So we worked.  And so on top of working, we get this ass and another one I'm about to read just trashing  us for having a subpar show.  And I argue the point.  I think we had a great show yesterday.  And we've had.  I stunk.  We've had awful shows.  But let me tell you something.  No one said anything because it wasn't.  Nothing had changed.  We were just.  We were doing the XM show or even the show at NEW.  We'd have a bad show.  We get called out by a couple of people, but this, then they use it like, oh, so this 
[03:47:00]  is what we get all the time?  You're like a little bitch who notices one fucking thing that you fucked up.  And all of a sudden, you fuck it up all the time.  Here's the post.  Like a bitch.  That's what you are, Pat Hinkle.  A little fucking bitch.  Well, it gets better.  It really does get better.  So I was on all the message boards yesterday reading the happy birthday wishes.  I thought that was cool.  So I was checking it out, right?  And then this one drew my attention on.  And it was on Whackbag.  It was this ass.  I don't know his name right now.  Dickie Boy. 
[03:47:30]  Dickie Boy.  Dickie Boy.  Dickie Boy posted, I sure hope this isn't a preview of things to come for XM subscribers  because today was probably the worst XM show I have heard so far.  He started the thread.  And what's the thread entitled?  I don't know now.  It's up.  You can find it there.  Oh, you're killing me.  Right at the top of the page.  Tuesday's show was awful.  Yeah, he starts the thing as Tuesday's show was awful.  So important. 
[03:48:00]  It couldn't go under the regular show thread, which they have every day.  It had to go under his own fucking thread.  Does Dickie Boy realize that one of the biggest highlights happened yesterday on the show he  thought sucked?  Yeah.  Stalker Patty screaming for a life as we were singing happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  It doesn't get much better than that, people.  Dickie Boy has a B in his bonnet.  So listen, Dickie Boy post this.  I sure hope this isn't a preview of things to come for XM subscribers because today was  probably the worst XM show I have heard so far.  I hate getting the tired, used-up O&A after the CBS show. 
[03:48:30]  Oh.  First of all, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  People are trying to split it.  Like, oh, well, they did this for CBS and this for us.  No.  We did that for XM, too, because you were listening to the really good stuff in his  mind that was on CBS yesterday morning.  Right.  All right.  So then, Anthony, I love when Anthony just says, you know what?  Four minutes.  Before we leave?  Yeah.  Because of Pat Hinkle and Dickie Boy.  That's right.  We'd have stayed till noon. 
[03:49:00]  We'd have stayed till 140, Pat J. Hinkle.  All right, listen, so this is Anthony's response to Dickie Boy, the post I just read.  Yeah, that's it.  We've put on a good month of shows since we've been on CBS and XM, but we have one day, one  off day on XM, and I got to read the old, I sure hope this isn't a preview of things to  come for XM subscribers, dot, dot, dot.  This, by the way, is a perfect example of a post that pisses the show off.  Nothing constructive whatsoever.  Just a bullshit insult based on one show out of hundreds. 
[03:49:30]  I'll be honest with you, me and Jimmy just weren't feeling it today.  When one out of the three of us are a bit off for the day, the other two can pick up  the slack, but when two of us are in a funk and can't seem to think like we do every other  day, it shows.  It's very rare, but it happens.  Excuse fucking us.  Preview of things to come.  Eat my fuck.  I did write, eat my fuck.  I love eat my fuck.  That's wonderful.  Fucking relax, Dickie boy.  I'm sure you aren't golden every day at the fucking fry machine. 
[03:50:00]  I had to.  The guy fucking pissed me off so bad.  Me and Jimmy even discussed it after yesterday's show.  We said like, God, you know, I wasn't feeling it.  Like sometimes when things happen, today's an example.  Things are happening.  We're talking about the anti-Semitic happy days, and we're going back and forth, and thoughts  are popping in your head.  Sorry, motherfucker.  Some days, it just doesn't happen like that.  And then people pick up on it like, oh, is this going to be a preview of things to come? 
[03:50:30]  Look, man.  Let's be honest.  We're just not that brilliant.  I'm tired of your fucking excuses, man.  I'm tired of your excuses.  I'm tired of your excuses for not being funny for six hours a day.  Yeah, every fucking day.  You understand?  That's some fucked up shit.  You guys are, you know what?  You're cheating the people.  Yeah, we're cheating Dickie Boy and fucking Patrick J.  Three minutes.  I'm disgusted with you.  You guys lack of ethics.  And let me tell you, you got one of the worst fucking names I've ever heard in my life.  We still got the top five worst sequels of all time, by the way. 
[03:51:00]  Well, we better get to them, because we're just kind of going through the motions now.  Rick in Boston, what's up?  Make it fast, because we got Brian Hurta on hold hearing all these curses.  Oh, my God.  Rick in Boston, go.  What's up, boys?  Happy Hanukkah, Jimmy.  Thanks.  This is a dumb movie comment.  Sorry to kind of hit the train wreck, but from Ghostbusters 2, actually, Bobby Brown did  a cameo when they were all going into some restaurant.  He was the doorman.  He was like, yo, where can I get one of them proton packs?  Oh, the bad Negro quote quotes.  And that's right, and Ghostbusters. 
[03:51:30]  And Ghostbusters 2.  Ghostbusters 2.  Bill on Long Island.  Bill.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Happy birthday, sugar tits.  Thanks.  Hey, you know, the history of the world, when they're walking down the street, and Josephus  and the comedian, you know, and the black guy walks up, and he's like, he's like, what's  happening, Josephus?  And Josephus, what's up, motherfucker?  Anyway, you know, black.  All right.  Oh, let's see what it...  Hello, Vinny Brand.  Hello.  Good, I'm on the radio. 
[03:52:00]  Okay.  Click.  What do you do?  Oh, he's going to sell it back.  What do you do?  He got an earful of click.  An email from E.L.O.  Stupid wait till 11.  He says, listening in a meeting as we speak.  What does that mean?  I don't know.  Chris in Philly.  What does that mean, E.L.O.?  I'm going to do a Batman movie.  What?  Black guy in a new Batman movie.  At the end of the movie, Commissioner Gordon is driving a back car, and he gets to the building,  and the black guy's outside going, hey, nice car.  I got to get me one of those. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, it's always so good.  E-O-Z.  Shuck and jive.  And black people don't use the word T-H in a hole.  I got to get me one of them.  One of those.  D took the place of T-H.  What the?  In the beginning of, what was the movie?  Was it Independence Day?  Or one of them with the black guy with the dog in the beginning, like the rumbling?  What was it?  That was Armageddon.  Okay, one of them.  There's always some shuck and jive line.  Oh, man.  We in trouble now. 
[03:53:00]  Brian Hurta.  Hey.  Pat Nanko, welcome to the show.  Sorry, Brian.  Oh, God, don't.  I've been listening a little bit.  Brian, we get a little upset, but it's not.  I can tell.  I got a phrase for you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No good deed goes unpunished.  Absolutely.  We're trying our best.  Where's my car crash?  And what's a...  You don't car crash, Brian.  Hey, man.  I see you driving, baby.  And I'm going to tell you, where the fuck did I get one of them cars?  With a number three on the side of that bitch. 
[03:53:30]  Brian, we're a little tired this time of day because we do about five to six hours of radio  a day.  And we're talking about worst sequels of all time.  You got one that you could think of?  Wow.  Putting them on the spot.  It does the Star Wars with the Ewoks.  Yeah.  Awful.  Right?  It's the horrible puppet show.  All right.  That's from nowhere.  So, Brian.  I'm sorry.  If you guys had prepped me, I would have thought about it.  I could have come up with something better.  Well, look.  Let's be honest.  We don't prep us.  Why would we prep the guests? 
[03:54:00]  Let's be honest, though.  Can we drive like you can?  Of course not.  Drives the number seven XM car.  Well, it's great because it's an Indy car.  He's got the XM all over his thing.  What are they called?  It's not a uniform.  It's a racing outfit.  Driver's suit.  It's a driver's suit.  It's a driver's suit.  Very nice.  The XM logo is right in the middle.  It's great.  No tie necessary.  Indy 500 going off, what, May 28th?  Yeah, Sunday.  That would be Sunday.  And how are we looking?  Is that the date?  No.  It's like the 25th or 6th. 
[03:54:30]  Is it the 20th?  I don't even know.  It would be Sunday, May 28th at 1 p.m.  Okay, here you go.  With ABC Sports providing live coverage beginning at 12 p.m.  on XM Satellite Radio Channel 145, the exclusive home of the Indy car series.  Wait a minute.  XM Radio is going to play the?  XM Satellite Radio.  It's going to play the Indianapolis 500?  Yeah.  How the?  How?  With commentary.  It's all about the announcement.  On the race.  Please give me just three seconds of race car commentary. 
[03:55:00]  No disrespect, because I wanted to ask you this, sir, Mr. Herter.  Yeah?  I'm black, and I'm a race car layman.  Please, could you please explain to me?  By the way, that was redundant.  That's redundant.  A black layman.  Can you please tell me, sir?  And no disrespect.  Please make race car driving.  Give me a new light on how to watch it, because all I see is something I can do if I decided  to do it.  Please let me know what the skill level of it is.  The strategy involved and everything. 
[03:55:30]  I'll give it.  And this is no disrespect.  I'm just saying, it seems to me that you're driving cars.  What's the thing?  I'll do it to you.  Coming off the last turn, here it is.  The final thing, Brian Herter, is in first place.  The number seven XM car across the better line, and wins the Indianapolis 500.  That's how it goes.  Exactly.  And you can't have fuzzy dice on your mirror.  Yeah, I don't know how to answer that.  I mean, the difference is, you know, like, everybody's played basketball or baseball.  You know how hard it is to hit a baseball or, you know.  It's easy.  You can put yourself in that position. 
[03:56:00]  Not many people have tried to go in to turn one flat at 230 miles an hour.  All right, see, now I'll tell you how it works.  Turn one flat.  See, these are terms that it's making it more than just driving.  And I'll tell you what it's all about.  Because I've listened to the Indy 500 on the radio before.  Okay.  If you've watched it before, you know what they're talking about.  You can picture it in your head, what's going on.  Okay.  Based on what they're saying.  It's not like a blind man is listening and has no idea what's going on.  You know what the cars look like, the drivers.  You know when they're talking about moves that they're making and passes that are going on and what turns. 
[03:56:30]  You know exactly.  You can picture it in your head.  If you're home, you'll probably watch it on TV.  It would be silly to listen at home.  But if you're driving and you're very interested, you're going to be able to know what's going on in the race.  So what's going on?  Yeah.  What's going on?  People are driving.  There's passing going on.  There's yellow flags.  There's hopefully not the red flags.  I'll tell you what's going on.  That each of the eight pistons in an IndyCar Series engine travels nearly, I think it's one mile up and down in the cylinder every minute. 
[03:57:00]  What a bit of trivia you're doing.  Every minute, Patrice.  So, Brian, what are you thinking?  I didn't even know that.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't even know that.  He drives the car.  Did you know that the 3.0 liter ethanol-powered engines of the IndyCar Series cars produce more than 650 horsepower?  Nearly four times that of the average street car.  I bet you didn't know that.  I didn't know that.  Would you and other guys try to run a nigga off the road if he was driving an Indy?  Like, if you saw me and I was like, hey, Brian, would you just go, fuck you, and just, would you put my back and have me roll down? 
[03:57:30]  Come on.  There's no, they don't really trade paint in Indy racing.  Not like NASCAR.  Oh, it ain't that fighting shit.  You don't have fenders.  You're tired of hanging out there.  Yeah, they're exposed there, Patrice.  Oh, it's a little friendlier than, uh.  Why don't we do the hacky radio interview with Brian Hurta?  It's a kinder, gentler crowd.  Yeah.  IndyCar racing, we love everybody.  Is that car noises in the background?  But it's very dangerous.  It's not like Jeff Gordon and these other animals fighting every five seconds.  A lot of guys, yeah, when they get close in NASCAR, they're banging into each other. 
[03:58:00]  These guys bump into each other, hit tires, they go flying.  It's over, Johnny.  It's very dangerous.  Brian, you calling us from the track?  I am.  Yeah, I hear the noises in the background.  Yeah, they got the garage doors going up and down.  You know, I told them how I'm doing a live radio interview.  The guys are like, okay, no problem.  He slams the door shut.  Thank you.  Right.  We should do the hacky radio interview.  So, Brian, you ever get pulled over for a speeding ticket?  Well, you know. 
[03:58:30]  And then he's got to tell us how he drives a small car and does 55.  Right.  You drive?  Yes.  How do you race in groupies?  And the cops say, what do you think you are, a race car driver?  And you've got to say, well, officer.  Matter of fact, I am.  Like when Jimmy gets pulled over and says a joke and they go, what are you, a pedophile?  Never once has it gotten me out of a ticket.  Brian, are they racing groupies in terms of like, I know there's racing groupies, but what level of the finish do you not have groupies? 
[03:59:00]  Like eighth or ninth is where, like, it ends?  I don't know.  I guess I'm high enough up I haven't had to notice where that cutoff is.  Oh, you got, oh, okay.  I didn't even know where I was going.  It still popped out of my mouth, Jimmy.  I apologize.  He's up there.  He qualified 16th.  You know, the thing I can count on when I go on your guys' show is whatever questions you ask are not the questions that I've never answered before.  Nobody has ever asked me that. 
[03:59:30]  A lot of people have been saying, though, that, like, this year's race is probably going to be much more competitive because just of a lot of, like, you know, what was because of, like, last year and they had that from the time before.  I don't know.  I mean, like, you know, they're trying to pump it up, obviously.  Every year they say that.  Oh, this is going to be the best one ever.  Hopefully it is.  Hopefully it is.  I mean, it's, you know, it will only be the best one ever, as far as I'm concerned, if we put the number seven car in the front.  There you go.  Where are you sitting?  Starting 16th, so right in the middle.  16th. 
[04:00:00]  In the middle of the pack.  Yeah.  Where is that, inside or outside?  I'm on the inside of the, what is that, the sixth row.  When you're 16th, realistically, how long do you figure before you can work your way up front?  How long driving?  It really depends.  I mean, we've got a 500-mile race, and so, you know, the race car, the race setup that we put on,  for 500 miles is a lot different than what we do to qualify for 10 miles.  Yeah, but you kind of, right away, want to get up, at least until the top, like, five or ten.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, hopefully, definitely, you know, by the time I make my first pit stop, we're up into the top ten, 
[04:00:30]  and I think, well, I started 18th last year and finished third, so I'm starting two better.  Hopefully, I can finish two better.  I'll be happy.  You don't want to be first, right?  Like, isn't that, how many people are actually leading the race at the beginning of the race that win?  Well, yeah, it's, I don't know what the exact statistic, but it doesn't mean you're going to win for sure.  Right.  Especially with a 500-mile race.  I've seen it.  It's just so much time.  I've seen Indy Racing, assholes. 
[04:01:00]  They're looking at me like I'm a jackass asking you these questions.  Do you feel this year, though, I mean, is the odds, like, if you start out, and I'm not really an expert on this at all,  but, like, you're in like 16th place or whatever.  Now, are the odds of you getting to first place, like, are they good or are they bad?  Because you have everybody in the competitive, like, status.  Right.  Well, I've had a really good month.  Qualifying was kind of actually the worst day I'd had.  Right.  We heard about that.  We've been running, you know, right up in the top eight or so every day that we've practiced. 
[04:01:30]  So I actually feel really good about it.  I think I've got a better shot this year than I had even last year.  How many years have you been racing, Brian?  Oh, a long time.  I don't know.  I think it's the 14th season racing IndyCars.  Yeah, I was going to say 15.  Has it gotten safer?  Because people say, like, the danger level, I mean, it could be higher because now that there's all these, the engines and the fact, you know,  it's just like everything has gotten, like, a little bit faster and a little bit more hardcore with the Admin. 
[04:02:00]  Right.  I'd say it's, in terms of the IndyCar series, it's about the same it's been since.  I've been racing in the IRL this series for five years, and I'd say it really hasn't changed that much in that time.  Maybe it's a little bit safer.  I was working hard to try and make it safer, but it is what it is.  How long does it actually take to run the Indianapolis 500 to become a complete novice?  It depends on, you know, how many yellow flags I have and stuff, but generally about three and a half hours.  Three and a half?  Yeah, three and a half.  Patrice wants to know why you guys got to bring race into this thing. 
[04:02:30]  What?  Well, it is a race.  That's what I mean.  Oh, a race.  That's funny.  Okay.  Hey, how hot is Danica?  I don't know.  You tell me.  How hot is she?  I don't think she's that hot.  For an IndyCar driver, she is.  Yeah.  I think she's hot because she's a chick.  In context.  And that's about it.  Yeah.  You know, it's like, yeah.  I mean, when you line her up with...  She says she's actually cool, and because...  You line her up with a bunch of dudes, of course you're going to say she's hot.  Hot for me.  It definitely makes her hotter, I think.  People actually thought... 
[04:03:00]  What's her name?  Who was the dragster?  Shirley Mildowney.  Shirley Mildowney.  They thought she was hot.  Marv Albert?  No, when you look...  Yeah, when you compare it to, you know, Don Garlitz, she's very attractive.  You look like the mother from Carrie.  I should have killed you.  I could see your dirty pillars.  Well, Brian, good luck on Sunday.  Yeah, best of luck on Sunday, man.  We'll be watching.  I'm going to be watching, man.  I'm going to be watching.  Yeah, currently in seventh place in the standings, just a few points away from third, right? 
[04:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  We're working there.  Yeah, right on, man.  Well, good luck on Sunday.  Good luck, buddy, with the big one.  I appreciate it.  It's good to talk to you guys again.  All right.  Thanks, Brian.  Thanks, Brian.  Okay, take care.  Bye-bye.  Brian Hurta, everyone.  He drives the XM car.  I hope the stock goes up, XM stock, or else halfway through the race, they're going to  have to take his tires.  They won't be able to.  They'll pull on the pit stop and be like, wait, it's not in the budget.  We have no more tires for you.  They're coming next week.  Absolutely.  Elo will be in the pit saying, oh, that's coming this summer.  Oops, your tires.  We weren't prepared for this. 
[04:04:00]  We don't have enough money for gas.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  That's what they would do.  They'd hook a propane tank up to the back.  You're going to say, give me 20.  The only, the only.  Give me 20 regular.  The only.  The only car at the Indianapolis 500 that doesn't have advertising on it.  Great.  There you go.  That's what XM gives you.  The only car.  Oh, shit.  Scott in Florida, what's up?  That should have got a bigger line.  That was a good fucking line.  I think we're all tired, and I think we're maybe going on a long time.  I actually didn't know if you were serious about that.  Well, we're giving him a half-assed show, but it was a good line. 
[04:04:30]  What?  I'm just kind of on the, I love the FM part, actually, and I'm an XM subscriber.  I love the FM.  It just seems like your guests, you get really good guests over there, and they do the walkthrough,  and for the most part, they kind of sound bored on the walkthrough, and then they get  to the XM show, and then they leave, and then they got someplace else to go.  Because they, oh, my God.  Are you guys ever going to get the fucking way radio works?  You guys do the...  How many hours did Dennis Leary do on our show yesterday?  No, I agree.  The average... 
[04:05:00]  Holy shit, I can't take these dummies.  You're a dummy, Scott.  The average celebrity is most...  You're doing a wrap-up.  Holy shit, will you fucking listen to me?  And I'll explain to your stupid brain.  And you always complain how spent you are, Opie.  You're always saying, God, I'm spent.  I've got to go home.  I haven't said that in a while.  First of all, I've been re-energized by this news.  You guys are such fucking assholes.  I hate all of you.  Nit-picky little bitches.  You're a nit-picky bitch. 
[04:05:30]  Let me lower Scott so I can explain.  These guys don't understand what they have with this radio show.  Dennis Leary did an hour, almost an hour and a half, maybe even longer of radio yesterday.  Yeah.  You don't get that from any other radio show.  An average celebrity interview is supposed to be 20 to 30 minutes tops.  Every once in a while, you get a guy who's like, hey, I'm having fun.  I'll hang for an hour.  Right.  This fucking guy's pissed off because Dennis Leary went home after doing an hour and a half  of radio.  But you should know, I'm on your side. 
[04:06:00]  Go ahead, Scott.  Go.  I don't want you on my fucking side.  You don't have to deal with these people.  Just put these people like me on hold.  Yeah, but Scott, Scott, but.  Just leave them on hold.  Never even deal with them.  But Scott.  And don't even mention how people complain.  Because it's a good look.  Yeah, but Scott.  Yeah, because that's what we're doing.  You do, you, a lot of the, a lot of the second shows.  You are such a dick, Scott.  You are such a dick, Scott.  You are such a dick, Scott.  You are such a dick, Scott.  Scott.  You are such a dick, Scott. 
[04:06:30]  You are such a dick, Scott.  All right.  You are such a dick, Scott.  Now how could you not like him?  You are such a dick, Scott.  He's doing a wah-wah penis.  How could you not like him?  Wah-wah penis.  Wah-wah penis.  How do you like that, Scott?  How do you like that, Scott?  How do you like that?  How do you like that?  How do you like that?  How do you like that, Scott?  Scott, what do you want to say?  Scott's done.  Oh.  Bruce from Louisiana. 
[04:07:00]  I just want to address that real quick.  Bruce.  Yeah, I was just going to ask Anthony.  I got a...  How the fuck old are you that Dan Garlitz is the only drag racer you could come up with?  All right, sir.  It's Don Garlitz.  And the reason I brought him up is he was racing at the same time Shirley Muldowney was.  It would have been silly for me to pick a drag racer that's racing now and say that she's attractive to him when they're in two different time periods.  So I picked a race...  All right, my fuck.  All right, you're damn right, Bruce from Louisiana. 
[04:07:30]  Let's break.  Thank you, sir.  No, one thing.  Next time, hold on.  No, one thing.  I want to hear what he has to say.  Okay.  What?  Hit the water, hit the water, hit the water.  All right.  What happened?  I think we've made a helicopter crashing reference.  But we didn't even care.  Can we break down what just happened on the show?  Nervous breakdown?  Well, I had a nervous breakdown.  Yes.  I know that.  My fifth of the week.  Jesus.  Anthony had to rack his brain to come up with a drag race driver from this same era as blah, blah, Shirley Muldowney. 
[04:08:00]  So it's fucking...  Why?  Who cares?  Because the reference wouldn't have been right if I used one...  If my life depended on it, I couldn't name one.  Richard Pryor.  One!  Wendell Scott.  Drag racer.  I just wanted my reference to be accurate.  That's all.  You don't need to be that accurate. 
[04:08:30]  It makes us all look really bad.  No, I try.  I want to be...  I try to be informed.  All right.  We're not to number one yet, are we?  No.  Top five sequels of all time.  We'll get through this and we'll get out of here.  Patrice O'Neill is going to be at Caroline's all weekend long starting tomorrow night.  212-757-4100.  Number five.  Worst sequels of all time.  I think I popped something.  Oh, yelling until your veins just go.  Something popped on the right side.  I might have to have that checked after the show.  You might want to have that checked. 
[04:09:00]  It didn't sound right.  I wanted to ignore it, but it just didn't...  It heard like a snap.  It's like when you pop the bubbles, that packing bubbles.  Right.  And then your voice kind of went...  I felt something kind of just go on the right side over here.  I went go.  You're not supposed to...  It sounded like a hip.  Yeah.  There might be a problem.  I'm not even kidding.  Okay.  This nigga broke his throat.  Oh, my God.  That hurt.  That nigga broke his throat.  These guys get me so fucking frustrated. 
[04:09:30]  We're giving them so much show.  We're trying our best.  We're still trying to figure out the kinks, but I think this is great.  I hope he has an Adam's grape now.  I think things are going very well so far.  The guests are getting better.  Adam's applesauce.  The walkover is like an amazing new bid.  I love the dump report thing.  We're getting bigger guests.  We're going to have bigger events because of this thing.  And I think the first half of the Opie and Anthony show forces us to get into  some serious radio instead of doing the hang all morning.  Right. 
[04:10:00]  Because we only have a certain amount of time.  So we feel like, all right, we've got to get our energy up and get into things.  We've been doing the same bid here for two hours.  Two hours, you bastards.  All right.  Making us yell at you.  This would have taken three days on the commercial radio stations.  Can I ask you a quick radio question, sir?  Yes.  I'll answer it.  What, uh, why, okay, why can't you do what you did just now and just do this for, so  from six to nine, if it drags out that long?  Because the QM won't allow it. 
[04:10:30]  And what happens is when Arbitron wants to know what the 1834 QM is, it just can't happen.  Oh, my God.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Obviously, Arbitron has a way of looking at 1839 men, but that demo is never the same  in all the markets.  Quiet.  Because sales has to know.  Quiet.  What does bad ququels mean?  Oh, sequels with a C?  It's on the pad data.  Oh, Jesus.  No way.  Oh, see, Derek's not in it.  Oh, okay.  Is Danny making Derek look stupid? 
[04:11:00]  Danny's fucking Derek so bad today.  Have you been doing that, like, all day?  Yeah.  Derek has stepped out, so Danny's like, you know what?  This could make myself look a little better than Derek.  I'm going to misspell everything.  All right.  Here we go.  Where's Derek, by the way, besides not a menza meeting?  Top five sequels.  Worst sequels of all time.  Let's do this.  Number five we already did, so there we go.  What are you, a pedophile?  We're closer to going home.  What's wrong?  Anthony's lying.  What?  What did I miss?  Oh, you're here.  Wow, Derek is actually coming in the studio. 
[04:11:30]  Danny.  He's great.  Danny is filling the pad data with all kinds of misspelled words because everyone thinks you're  running it, so they all think you're stupider than you really are, which is almost impossible.  So he's been running the board the whole day today, so.  But he's doing it on purpose to make you look stupid.  You look really dumb.  You look like a smart guy.  Yes.  Like, you look like a college guy that's kind of smart.  He's disarmingly stupid.  Like, you.  Are you kidding? 
[04:12:00]  Fuck, I'm out of here.  I'm not even taking this shit.  He doesn't know how to.  This isn't his deal.  Yeah, he doesn't know how to fight that.  He's a behind-the-scenes guy.  He doesn't know.  But I'll tell you, that right there was smart.  Because every one of you other idiots sit there and, duh, I, duh.  He goes, I'm not taking this fucking shit.  And he's out.  With his young lieutenant colonel hairdo.  You listen to me, young lieutenant.  Top five worst sequels of all time.  So we did Batman and Robin featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger and George Clooney as Batman. 
[04:12:30]  That's the fifth worst sequel of all time.  Number four.  Blues Brothers 2000.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Now we're talking.  All right.  Now we're talking some shit.  That's what Joe Morton from A Brother of Another Planet  and fucking John Goodman and a Kid.  Yeah.  Do you know what the name is?  Awful.  Do you know the other name of that one?  Yes.  I bet I can guess. 
[04:13:00]  Let Iraq say that one.  Sticking with the theme that went.  Yeah, it's so easy.  Let Iraq out.  Iraq out.  Iraq out.  What is it called?  I wasn't paying attention.  Of course you weren't.  Oh, my God.  The easiest one of the day.  There's a sound clip.  Please get that.  Him going, I wasn't paying attention.  What's on the screen right now?  Hopefully fucking arid or degree.  Jesus.  What do you use for deodorant?  Fucking wet meat?  Do you dip a pork chop in fucking...  Yeah, do you shake and bake something in fucking gel 
[04:13:30]  and then wipe it under your dirty arms?  Chicken cutlet speed stick.  What do you use?  Animal fat?  Deodorant?  Gelatin?  He's on arid.com.  Here, let me dry your armpits.  Oh, my God.  Sweating through two shirts and a t-shirt.  Fucking nervous monkey.  All right, here we go.  Please, God, don't let them see that I'm a complete ass.  I want to go. 
[04:14:00]  All right, fourth worst sequel of all time,  Blues Brothers 2000.  Oh, God damn it.  With good old Goodman there, yep.  John Goodman and Dan Aykroyd.  Cheaper by the Dozen 2.  Number three.  I love this movie.  Patrice is going to have something to say about number three.  Worst sequels of all time.  The next generation.  Roots 2.  Roots 2.  Oh, my God.  Roots 2 is the revenge.  Where Kooten Kinty follows you to Bahamas. 
[04:14:30]  Roots.  Roots 7, the you-know-what's take Manhattan.  Roots 8, put them in space.  They hate my obnoxious laughs, I'm going to laugh more now.  Number three.  Worst sequels of all time.  Leprechaun.  Back to the T-H-A hood.  Leprechaun. 
[04:15:00]  Yeah, that's so fucking stonker.  That movie was hilarious because the Leprechaun thing is smoking crack and hunting homies.  Yeah.  You seen it?  Yes, it's hilarious.  It really is a funny fucking movie.  It's so bad, it's funny.  Does the Leprechaun look like, what's his, John Madden?  Doesn't the Leprechaun look just like him?  Big eyebrows.  I don't agree with that.  He's smoking weed and hunting the homeboys.  Yeah, I don't agree with that.  He stole his pot of gold.  And he's killing them in homeboy ways.  He's like, come here, let me, I'm going to throw a rim at your face.  He's like, hey, he kills a motherfucker with a rim.  With a rim. 
[04:15:30]  He kills a nigga with a basketball.  Hey, nice basketball.  Throws it through his eye.  Oh, shit.  But he's Irish.  Half his face is a basketball.  What the hell is that about?  It's one of those movies that's worth watching if you're in the right state of mind.  It's hilarious.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  If a movie could spark a race riot, this is it.  Pete from Connecticut is ready to spark a race riot.  Oh, shit.  Roots 2, Electric Jigaboo.  Roots 2, Electric Jigaboo.  Leave it to Connecticut.  That one came right out of Connecticut. 
[04:16:00]  Big racist state.  You and Massachusetts.  All right, number two.  The runner-up for worst sequel of all time.  What do you think?  What hasn't been said?  Worst one ever?  This one?  Number one or two?  This is the runner-up.  The runner-up.  Did you just peek at number one?  No.  You did, didn't you?  Taylor Hicks.  He's going to win it all tonight, but who cares?  Who cares?  Breaking two.  And we're big fans of American Idol.  They can go fuck themselves.  Hey. 
[04:16:30]  Too scared to have the American Idols on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, they might have to hear what they heard when we're talking about the Hinkle gentleman.  Dude, we had Ace Young on, and we treated him with nothing but respect.  And we didn't even like the guy.  And what did we get?  What other radio shows did they do?  We think he was a poser and questionably gay.  Route 17.  We didn't say any of that shit.  One is dating my daughter from Chester's liver.  Jesus Christ.  You're talking, you're trashing him and saying how much respect.  We treated that faggot with so much love and attention that fuck, like that fuckhole taking 
[04:17:00]  dicks in his cigar burn every five seconds, dick sucking faggot.  But we were so nice to him.  And all we did was stroke his gay mane and feed him fucking M&M's.  Dude, I'm sick of it, though.  I'm like, I think Simon Cowell is unbelievable on that show, and they just make fun of him  for no reason.  I wanted to talk to Simon.  I thought we'd have a great interview with that guy.  I think Ryan Seacrest stinks.  And we were supporting the show since day one, every week. 
[04:17:30]  And I hear these American idols on the dumbest radio shows.  Then why are our page here?  Why can't they be on this show?  They're all over America and Canada.  The first question will be, hey, Taylor, you retarded, stupid-ass, redneck, dumb idiot.  Absolutely not.  Stop pretending to be Joe Cocker, fuckface.  Hey, Sean came on, and we did a good bit with him.  And we had Anthony's sister interview him because, you know, all the girls love him.  Right.  And Anthony found out that Dawn was pretty much getting moist watching American Idol every 
[04:18:00]  week.  Hey, hey, it's my sister.  Roots 30.  Pimp my ride.  All right, here we go.  Runner Up.  Worst sequel of all time.  It's cute.  Caddyshack 2.  All right.  Is not the number one sequel of all time.  Runner Up.  That movie is, we don't even have to talk about it so fucking bad.  There's some funny points.  With Dan Aykroyd trying to be Bill Murray, that is, I mean, we don't have to talk about  We played all his lines one day on this show.  And then, what's his name?  Oh, Jackie Mason. 
[04:18:30]  Jackie Mason.  Yeah.  Because they couldn't get Rodney.  Right.  Jackie Mason, trying to be the comic.  It was so bad.  Do you know what's funny, though?  It was the gopher.  He made me laugh.  Dude.  They didn't have Bill Murray.  They didn't have Rodney.  They didn't have Ted Knight.  It said special appearance by Chevy Chase, and it looks like they filmed it months after  everything else.  Because they knew how bad the movie was.  Yeah.  They just dropped them in, right?  Dropped them in.  They had the gopher, though.  He was funny.  Running through the earth.  You just don't like puppets in movies. 
[04:19:00]  That's what I'm starting to think.  So ungodly.  Worst sequel of all time.  Worst sequel of all time.  Did we say it?  No.  Have we said it?  No.  I don't think.  Oh, wait.  What genre is it?  No, you might have said it.  Oh.  I think you might have said it.  I already know it.  I think Anthony said it.  Yeah, I'm going to be a little horror, too.  Let me say hi to Wade in Toronto.  Wade.  How are you doing, guys?  It's my deal, Wade.  What's up, Wade?  Hey, Wade.  Wade.  Oh, these are some sweet numbers. 
[04:19:30]  You guys told us to give you a couple weeks when this new deal came in, and I got to say,  you guys are doing great now, Matt.  All right.  We know you are.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Wade.  And, Jimmy, I think they let your joke slide earlier when Anthony said dragster, and you  said Marv Albert.  Yeah, I thought that was a good one.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well, the listeners are here to point it out, and we can laugh later.  Very good.  We're here in the replay.  Very good.  Chris in Florida.  Hey, listen.  First off, guys, I got two of the good Black Man movie quotes. 
[04:20:00]  Thanks for it.  But I do want to say to all the cock-chugging pussies out there, go listen to Paul Harvey.  You don't want to hear it, don't listen, right?  There you go.  If you think there's another show out there doing a better job than us, then go find us.  Exactly.  Go fucking find us.  You're supposed to give me a chance, right?  All right.  Anyhow, how about this one?  Patrice in Better Off Dead when John Cusack is going underneath the bridge in the garbage  truck, and the black guy says,  Hey, folks throwing away a perfectly good white boy like that. 
[04:20:30]  Yeah, but that's an old joke.  Okay, well, then wait.  I got one more.  I got one more?  Hurry up.  Let's go.  We want to go home.  The black guy in the boat on Caddyshack.  He doesn't say anything.  Oh, yeah.  He does the big googly eyes before he jumps off and the boat cuts his little boat.  Duke in Jersey.  Go ahead, Duke.  Yeah.  Crocodile Dundee spawned some good sequels.  And in the first one, when the crocodile goes drinking in the bar, the black guy, the  pimp goes,  He's cool.  You have pointed out something. 
[04:21:00]  Yeah, it's very funny.  Like, we've all noticed it, but never really thought about it.  I never really registered.  But I meant to point it out.  No, you didn't.  That's my new bit.  Everything somebody does, I was going to do.  I was just going to snap your fingers first, Norman.  I was going to point that out.  Or this.  Oh, I was just saying that.  Anthony named the worst sequel of all time.  What genre, Albie?  What genre?  Dancing. 
[04:21:30]  Oh, what?  You named it?  Dirty Dancing?  It's a dancing movie.  It's a dancing movie?  Staying Alive.  I mentioned it.  From Saturday Night Theater?  I want credit.  No, you were just going to mention it, and I said it first.  Did you really?  No, I did say it.  Your mic worked.  Did you really?  I absolutely did.  No, we didn't.  Did you really?  I bet you a kiss to a handjob.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Did you really?  I promise you.  Did you really?  Wouldn't lie.  Did you really?  I always tell the truth.  Did you really?  Even when I lie.  Did you really?  Stop it.  Did you really?  Stop it.  Did you?  Stop it.
