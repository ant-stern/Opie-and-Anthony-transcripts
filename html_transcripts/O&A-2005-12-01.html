<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion centered around a MySpace "friend" count competition between Anthony Cumia and Jim Norton, with Cumia detailing his tactics, including posting childhood videos.  The segment also involved a fake Opie profile that fooled Rich Voss, and updates on the "Assault on the Media" contest, with No Filter Paul calling in to recount his latest outrageous live TV interruption involving a Santa hat and a physical altercation.  Sonny Ferelli, a past contest winner, also called in, discussing his own failed attempt and accusations of being betrayed. The hosts then played listener-submitted "Dickie Goodman"-style songs, comedic parodies answering interview questions with song lyrics, covering topics from a "Whore Bitch Chef" to Andrea Yates. They previewed an upcoming interview with the author of "Sinful Nims," a book of adult acronyms. Ben, a show producer, briefly appeared in studio, his sweater becoming a target of ridicule.

The show continued with a deep dive into the comedically bad novelty songs of Dickie Goodman, focusing on songs about Santa Claus, King Kong, and the energy crisis, with the hosts and Jim Norton reacting with amusement and disgust.  They discussed Goodman's suicide with morbid humor and speculated on his family's reaction. The conversation then shifted to listener-submitted song ideas, a planned Goodman song remake, and further discussion of *Sinful Nims*, with author Stealing Clausey calling in.  Jay Moore was a guest in the studio, participating in conversations about Paul McCartney, Neil Diamond, Bono's activism, and an AIDS Day banner in Bryant Park.  The segment was filled with vulgar language, offensive jokes, and interruptions from antagonistic callers, culminating in a song about AIDS.

The next segment began with a graphic anecdote from Opie about his daughter urinating on him. The conversation moved to various celebrities including Britney Spears, Kevin Federline (whose music was debated), Scott Stapp, and Howie Mandel, interspersed with musical interludes featuring Black Sabbath and Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Jay Moore continued his appearance, discussing his NASCAR Awards hosting experience, his contentious relationship with Howard Stern, and a negative CringeHumor.com review.  The segment included offensive language, crude humor, and a caller, Oscar, detailing bathroom graffiti issues at his truck stop job, leading to further off-color discussions and listener-submitted NASCAR jokes.  More personal anecdotes and exchanges between hosts and guests followed, punctuated by technical difficulties and unplanned calls. The segment concluded with promotion for upcoming comedy shows featuring Jay Moore and Jeffrey Ross.


The show then featured comedian Jeff Ross, promoting his Caroline's Comedy Club shows. Jay Moore performed his self-described "terrible" song, "Almighty Malachi Professional Bowling God," filled with profanity.  A significant portion focused on crude, humorous discussions about defecation and "poking a log," including a personal anecdote from Opie.  A mock Avis commercial audition with a studio employee, Than, provided further comedic moments.  Listeners called in, with one asking Ross about a Shaq O'Neal roast joke, another recalling an old Opie and Anthony bit, and another defending "cringe humor."  Actor Robert Patrick then called in, promoting *Walk the Line*, discussing his career, including *Terminator 2*, and sharing humorous anecdotes about working with Al Pacino and Christopher Walken, and his brother's music career.  The segment continued with offensive language and humor.

The final segment opened with Opie expressing anger over a $12,000 fee for a children's event. The hosts discussed Robert Patrick's unfamiliarity with XM radio, leading to jokes about his location near the Hollywood Bowl.  The conversation then shifted to the difficulty of getting into a specific country school, escalating into jokes using derogatory terms like "slope" and "Dominican" to describe racial groups.  The hosts engaged in offensive jokes about various ethnicities, including Asians and Dominicans.  The conversation turned to Gary Glitter's child abuse charges, R. Kelly's alleged sexual misconduct, and a hate crime against midget neighbors.  Numerous offensive jokes and comments followed.  A listener called, accusing Jim Norton of racism, which Norton denied.  The show concluded with more promotion for Jeffrey Ross's show and a mention of an upcoming eggnog segment, with continued praise for Jay Moore.

[00:05:30]  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  THE END  We can start with the MySpace update.  Oh, great.  Good, now I'll just have more to answer.  Anthony Cumia has 2,787 friends. 
[00:06:00]  I really thought I was making headway.  I really thought I was making headway and overtaking the very popular, especially with the tranny community, James Norton.  I'm just pounding all night, getting new friends, actually writing them back.  I'm more of a quality MySpace friend than Jimmy is.  Jimmy might have the quantity, but I have read nothing but scathing reports from people. 
[00:06:30]  Let's see, you never answer them back.  They tried to be your friend like a month ago and have gotten no response.  And I just write back, hello, greetings, my newest friend.  That's not true.  I do actually write them back, chicks.  I mean, if a chick fan writes to me, man, I get back to them.  How many does Jimmy have?  And Jim Norton has 3,341.  Can you believe it? 
[00:07:00]  You're getting there, though, Anthony.  You're getting there.  Yeah, I'm working on it.  You're about 600 behind, more or less.  I'm working on it.  Last night, I popped up a little piece of video on there.  I put me and my brother Joe, when we were very little kids, on Christmas morning, playing.  I was playing my little drum set.  Joe's playing his little guitar.  And I'm crying because the drum set kept sliding forward on me as I was trying to play it.  I hit the little bass pedal, and it would slide forward.  And I'd grab my little seat and move it forward and sit back down and play. 
[00:07:30]  And then I just lost my mind and started crying.  I'm a whining bastard.  I think I wrote something like, I should have been one of the Yates children.  Like, just a horrible, crying, whining little mess I was.  And it's right next to the album cover of Prussian Blue.  Another couple of cute little kids.  That might bring in more traffic.  Yeah, sure.  DougoutDoug, right off the bat, wants to know something about your MySpace account.  DougoutDoug from Whackbag.com. 
[00:08:00]  What's up?  You know, Anthony, I want to know just who Jen Maz is in your top eight.  Everybody else deserves to be there.  But who is this person that is there instead of myself?  I am giving the opportunity, this is another thing, to pump up my traffic and my friends.  Opportunity every day, every day, I will take two random people from my friend list and pop them up on my top eight,  making them celebrities and actually getting them more friends. 
[00:08:30]  I had people yesterday, one of them I believe was Jen, who wrote me and said,  I can't believe how many friends I have now because I was on your front page.  They are just random people I pick out of my friend list every day.  Could be you.  You could win the Anthony friend list MySpace lottery.  I'm doing the same thing.  And pop up.  Even our own Than was adding a little jab, a little beg in today to get him back up there  because I had removed him to put two of the anonymous people up. 
[00:09:00]  And Than was a little taken aback and asked,  what will it take to get me back on the front page there?  Than, did your traffic take a little hit from that?  Sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah, it did take a little dip.  Yeah.  Yeah, that sucks.  Yep.  See, I got a lot of people coming in on a daily basis.  Jimmy, he has more than I do, but you started with a couple of thousand people.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  I've made a couple of thousand in almost 3,000 in two days.  A lot of them are probably, well, there's no need to brag.  I mean, a lot of them are probably mutual friends.  A lot of them are probably my friends, and I'm glad they're your friends as well.  I encourage people to be friends with both.  Well, I'm sure the people that are bad-mouthing you and the way you treat them are not friends of yours.  I do.  They're just my friends.  I do write them back, but it takes a while.  As I have other things to do, I'm doing sets.  I understand.  I guess other things.  And basically, if you're a male, you're not writing them back. 
[00:10:00]  I write males back.  See, that's the problem.  And that's why Anthony's going to kick your ass.  Males actually spend more money.  I support Anthony in this MySpace race.  A lot of time listening to this program, a lot of the guys.  The girls do, too.  I do write the guys back.  And when the guys, the guys are more impatient, though.  They'll write you an expected answer back.  No one's been waiting for more than a few days for me to answer that.  Well, that's not what I've read.  I mean, I've read weeks.  Weeks I've been waiting to be added.  No way.  Well.  It's not true.  This is what I've read.  Well, Jim, I did notice that Bill Burr in Anthony's Top 8, Jim Norton is not. 
[00:10:30]  That's because gay people always stick together.  I took Jimmy off of my Top 8 because it was counterproductive.  That's right.  Because it was then getting people to go to Jimmy's site and become Jimmy's friend.  Yeah, Anthony's a very smart man.  And I noticed I was not on Jimmy's Top 8.  Well, I don't believe in competitions.  I think we should all just be friends.  Just be friends. 
[00:11:00]  Anthony might write you back.  And I write you back, too.  It just takes me longer.  I'm busy.  Plus, I injured my hand.  How am I supposed to type with a hurt hand?  Anthony can't even keep up with all the requests.  I can't keep up every time I log in now.  There are just pages and pages of new friends and people for me to meet and chat with.  See, he can't even keep up.  I can keep up.  That's why it takes me a while.  I get back to every person.  I told you a handwritten note, which I pen myself.  Handwritten.  That's right.  With a feather quill and some ink.  I dip it by candlelight.  You seal the envelope with a waxed Jimmy Norton seal with a log. 
[00:11:30]  Dear Scott Peterson's cock.  Yes, and the names.  I know.  The names are just the words.  My dearest fag hater.  It pleases me to find you well on this eve.  Placeholder Opie, who did put me in his Top 8.  Thank you, Placeholder Opie.  Placeholder Opie causing a lot of trouble with idiots like Rich Voss. 
[00:12:00]  Whatever.  The Placeholder Opie, it's a picture of Opie from the new photo shoot we did, by the way.  So I think that might have thrown him.  It's kind of a picture that no one's seen before.  And he got in touch with Rich Voss and invited Rich to come in and do the show one morning.  And Rich was calling Ben, asking him what time he should be in.  And Placeholder Opie, his profile right there, says, I am Placeholder Opie.  This is not Opie.  I'm just holding this if Opie decides to join my friend. 
[00:12:30]  Is he getting friends, that guy?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  All right.  Voss is a dummy.  The second time something like this has happened to Rich Voss, there was a fake Rich Voss that  duplicated Voss's account completely.  Is he now Bitch Voss?  Yeah.  Well, now he's Bitch Voss.  But originally he was Rich Voss and had Rich's complete bio down to a T.  And he was in Bill Burr's Top 8.  People like Bill Burr and Bob Kelly were leaving him comments. 
[00:13:00]  Apparently this guy got with me and told me that he invited one of these well-known celebrities  over to Rich Voss's house for Thanksgiving.  And Voss had actually contacted me to ask who this guy was and how to get rid of him  because he was inviting people to his house.  That's good.  Now he's Bitch Voss.  It's Rich Voss's head on a hot chick's body.  Bitch Voss.  Well, you can get to Anthony Cumia's MySpace account through opiananthony.com. 
[00:13:30]  And Jim Gordon's too, Ope.  Oh, and Jim Gordon.  You can get to Anthony Cumia's MySpace account by going to opiananthony.com.  See, I don't have all the power.  The big fancy men have all the...  You're still in the lead.  That doesn't matter.  There you are.  Your lead is dwindling, though.  You'll keep creeping up, though.  I don't think I'm going to beat Jimmy.  You will.  How did they get to yours?  600 more.  Through opianthony.com, apparently.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know that.  I'm sorry.  MySpace splash the link.  Splash Jim Norton.  Hey, Doug out.  You can get to mine through fake opi's. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, Doug out.  Yes.  We're smuggling weapons for your next mission.  Has anyone got a hold of you yet?  You know what?  I have a lot of PMs I haven't gotten through.  All right.  We got some new weapons.  That's exciting.  For the pests.  I'm very...  But there is another mission before that one.  The next mission is Sunday morning at 10 a.m.  That's a left jab comment.  That's a left jab comment.  These frigging guys, man.  These pests.  They're everywhere.  They were on the video chat there last night. 
[00:14:30]  I'll just say it's a certain video chat.  And they're just all lined up, sitting in front of their laptops, staring at each other.  And Doug, he's a psycho.  He just yells at people and yells about things.  I hear, like, all of a sudden, shit will come blurting out of the speakers.  It's Doug yelling.  And I have no idea what he's even yelling at.  He's yelling at girls that show up on the thing.  Calling them, like, fucking ugly whores.  And you're a nasty man, Doug. 
[00:15:00]  I try to be nice.  It just doesn't work sometimes.  You're nasty.  And he's drinking.  He's getting all drunk and belligerent on video.  And you can just watch him.  And then Big A pops in.  So Big A is sitting there.  And everyone asks him, hey, Big A, how are you doing tonight?  And you just hear, and you see his big, stupid face.  It's hysterical.  A couple of girls show their tits and stuff.  Do you go on video?  No, I don't go on video. 
[00:15:30]  I don't have a camera in the house.  And I wouldn't want to go on video.  God knows where those pictures would show up.  Let's get some cameras.  Me and you will talk.  Me and you will talk.  We've been trying to get cameras in the studio for over a year.  Now, that would be nice.  For over a year.  In the studio.  It amazes me we can't have that figured out.  We can't figure it out.  No.  Rush Limbaugh has video feeds every day.  I know.  Why can't we?  Why can't we?  That's right.  Anthony is internet gold.  He mentioned something in the people flock.  We had more people in that chat last night than we have ever had before. 
[00:16:00]  We had about 30 people in there last night.  The room was packed.  A lot of video.  Chicks.  Hey, Doug OutDoug.  Yes.  What's the latest mantra?  The latest mantra?  Yeah, you're one of the biggies in the O&A Army.  One of the top pests.  Yeah.  What's the latest mantra of this program?  I think I'm using the right word.  I think you're confusing the shit out of Doug OutDoug here.  Yeah, I'm hurt right now.  He's put on the spot and doesn't know what the hell to say.  Wherever?  Oh, yeah.  Wherever Howard is, the pests will be there. 
[00:16:30]  Ah.  Wherever Howard Stern goes, the pests will be there, too.  That is right.  And we got new weapons for the next one, bro.  That is right.  We're just pricing them out right now.  We're going to smuggle some weapons to you guys.  Pricing them out.  I'm trying to get off work to come all the way up there for that because I suck and I'm  a loser.  All right.  Remember the mantra.  Pass it on.  All right.  And just remember that, man.  Yeah.  Okay.  Whoa.  Hey.  Come on, Doug.  Doug.  That really wasn't going to work.  That's beginner shit.  And by the way, this fake Opie, this is how dumb Voss is. 
[00:17:00]  He calls Ben.  If anyone's seen that tight thing Ben is wearing as a shirt sweater today, I want to stick a  knife in him.  Is it really bad?  Dude, it's a fucking...  I didn't say it.  It's an awful, awful form-fitting top.  Well, there's some kind of weird sickness going on because now Ben has it.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  It's called, look at Mr. Tissue, a producer over there.  Yeah.  Derek is sneezing today.  Hey, Nathaniel's better, so it's like a 24-hour thing. 
[00:17:30]  Now Ben has it.  It's just a cold.  It sucks and no one likes it, but...  And I was watching Imus on MSNBC this morning, getting ready for the program, and our pal  Rob Bartlett's on, doing his Brian Wilson character with our Opie and Anthony t-shirt  on.  And he's all...  He's all sick.  He's all sickly, and he was at the gig Saturday night at Caroline's when we were all watching  Jim Norton.  Maybe he made everyone sick.  So it's going around.  Goodness.  But Ben was so sick that he had the window open that...  Oh, my God.  And that was pissing Anthony off big time. 
[00:18:00]  He's like, I don't feel good or something.  And Ben's sitting in front of the wide open window in the office.  The office isn't that big.  And it's just blowing on me.  I went in there.  I was freezing.  And it's in the high 30s here in New York, so...  It's freezing.  I guess you shouldn't have the window open.  No window's open.  Voss...  Someone contacted Voss and said to do the O&A show, but be in at 6.  Yeah.  And he contacts Ben and goes, is that Opie?  Because he wants me in at 6.  Why does he want me in at 6?  I'm like, Ben, you got to go with that. 
[00:18:30]  You have to have that dummy here at 6.  Yeah.  Tell him we're doing some kind of bus thing.  What are you doing?  Yeah, what are you just...  Yeah, standing outside smoking.  What have you been here for?  That's very, very funny.  I wish Ben could come in.  Where is he?  He doesn't...  No, he's at his computer.  Maybe he'll get up.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hey, we've got to announce the winner of the Assault on the Media Contest.  It is December 1st.  Where's the year gone?  Yeah, no kidding.  My goodness.  No kidding.  And we have started the Assault on the Media Contest for December. 
[00:19:00]  Mm-hmm.  Today is the first day.  Yep.  Last night, though...  Under the wire.  You've got a lot of these guys.  Last night, my phone rings around...  What time is that at?  6?  6 o'clock news?  5.30.  5.30 news.  5.30 news.  Now they have, like, 3.30 news.  Yeah, it's the news all the time.  Wasn't the news just on at 6?  6 and 11.  Then you had the national feed at 6.30.  But now it's like...  Sometimes I turn on my TV at, like, 3.30 in the afternoon.  They're already doing local news.  Yeah.  Anyway, the phone rings. 
[00:19:30]  It's E-Rock.  E-Rock optional.  And he's like, dude, dude, dude, just listen.  And I guess you had two cell phones working, obviously.  You were listening in on the assault?  All I heard...  E-Rock gets me on the phone and he doesn't even really...  He doesn't say hi.  He just goes, dude, listen.  And now I'm listening in as no filter Paul in that horrific accent of his is yelling and  screaming at a reporter from WABC-TV here in New York City. 
[00:20:00]  She's screaming at him, you know, where do you work?  I'm going to come to your job and interrupt you.  Yeah.  And just screaming.  Screaming stuff like...  Urban Anthony!  Screaming stuff like, I spent three hours working on this live shot and you just fucked  it up and cost us $2,000 or something like that?  He's yelling something about you cost us $2,000 where I don't know what that meant.  But she's like, I worked on this for three hours.  What if I showed up where you work and did this to you?  And he goes, come up to the studio tomorrow morning. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, don't work there, but fuck it.  This assault of the media thing, it has taken on a life of its own.  You know, we can't get enough of it.  It's just getting better and better.  I love it.  And they're consistently funny.  I have not grown tired of watching them happen.  When the video gets posted and I watch it, I sit there and they add enough for the beginning  where it looks like it's just a news thing and you know the evil is coming.  And when it hits, I'm a blithering, laughing fool in my house watching. 
[00:21:00]  Well, last night, No Filter Paul did another assault in the media.  I think he did five or six this month alone.  And this time he was wearing a Santa hat.  And he just looks like a complete lunatic.  Like they just released him from a mental hospital.  He is an ass.  He comes running in with the huge, you know, Opie and Anthony cardboard sign or whatever  with our cartoon characters.  He's screaming, Opie and Anthony on XM satellite radio.  The visual is perfect. 
[00:21:30]  And then all of a sudden you hear something like, don't hit me, don't hit me, ah!  Just losing his freaking mind.  So I don't know if, I guess, he says that some big black dude came running into the shot  and tackled him.  Grabbed him.  But I can't really see because all you see is some big massive person go running by the  reporter and just slam into him.  You see that?  Dumb hat.  Dumb Santa hat.  Yeah, the video is up on opianthony.com.  It's another, another great assault on the media today. 
[00:22:00]  And we got no filter Paul on the line here.  Let's say hi to Paul.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  What's going on, man?  Oh, fun last night.  Dude, you look like a lunatic on TV.  That's why I love when you do them.  You look like you could be a real problem.  He's a crazy person.  You're like, yeah, exactly.  But the Santa hat was a nice touch last night.  Right.  Just watching the video.  I know.  How funny is that?  And then it just ruins the whole segment. 
[00:22:30]  She has to stop what she's saying.  They go back to the anchor desk.  They're not ready.  No.  They have to go to the story.  Yeah.  And then apparently she wasn't ready because a lot of yelling was going on to do her little  follow-up to the story.  No, actually what happened is we were at the corner by Port of Faraday.  That's where the TV crew was.  Port of Faraday.  Oh, is that the worst?  That isn't even English you're speaking.  Yes, it is.  It's proper English.  No, it is not a foreign.  Anyway, I had walked away and she chased me with some member of the crowd who was just 
[00:23:00]  stood there, some big black guy, taking my picture with his trio.  And that's why they didn't come back to her because she was half a block away cursing me  out, which is what Opinus had torn the phone.  And what is that going to do, like taking a picture of you with their trio?  Well, apparently they're sending it to NYPD and I'm going to be had harassment charges,  which will go quite well with the assault charge I'm going to have against their camera  guy.  So who tackled you?  The camera guy?  The cameraman, yeah.  Well, but the camera was still on the reporter.  Right.  It was on a tripod.  Oh, it was on a tripod.  So he ran from behind the camera and tackled you out of the shot. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  They must all be talking like the camera guys.  When they all get together, they must be like, if that fucking happens to me, I'm running  out, they must all have plans.  I'm going to run out and grab that motherfucker.  They must all have a plan.  Especially ABC because they've been attacked so many times this month, it's not even funny  anymore.  And now they're acting so quickly like that.  Like he jumped into the picture, started his shit, and the cameraman just immediately  like went with his plan that you know he had.  And we got some pests at work at some of these local TV stations here in New York. 
[00:24:00]  You got to get us the memos, guys.  Just sneak the memos out because I know they're talking about this behind the scenes.  And harassment charges.  How about the way these fuckheads harass people walking into courtrooms and out of courtrooms  and stick microphones in your face and hang out on your front lawn?  Exactly.  It's freedom of the press is what they say.  So this is freedom of the press.  So you're dealing with very smart broadcasters.  We figure this out.  As long as you don't touch the reporter, there's nothing they can do.  It's fair game.  Once they take those cameras out into public like that, it's open season to get in front 
[00:24:30]  of that camera.  They don't own the property that is in front of that camera.  They're there doing their live shot.  And anything that happens in the periphery, that's their problem.  It's not illegal.  If there was a murder, they wouldn't try to sue behind them.  They would fucking film it.  They wouldn't try to sue the person for harassment.  Yeah.  That would be more news.  It wouldn't fuck up their shot.  But him running there with a Santa hat, while he probably should be shot for it, there's 
[00:25:00]  no reason to be sued for harassment.  You guys want to hear it?  It's pretty good.  It's classic.  The video is much better.  It's up on opiananthony.com.  Yeah.  Here's the audio.  Our top story this half hour, a pregnant woman taking a stand because she was denied a seat  on a public bus.  There are bus seats that are designated for elderly, handicapped, or pregnant women.  But the 27-year-old mother-to-be was told to go to the back of the bus, and now she is  fighting back.  Eyewitness News reporter Kimberly Richardson is live at the Port Authority with more.  Kimberly?  Well, Diana, there's no law saying you have to, but most degree, doing so is just good 
[00:25:30]  matters.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Paul, why were you yelling, hit me?  He's playing blackjack with the guy.  The guy basically grabbed me and threw me against a bus.  Yeah.  I'm like, you can't touch me.  Come on, then.  Hit me.  Hit me.  It's going to be on live TV.  Don't hit me.  Come on, let's go.  I want to get hit on live TV, you know?  Wow.  That was great.  I want to ask you a question. 
[00:26:00]  Why did the media have to do a fucking live shot at Port Authority?  Was the pregnant woman there?  Was it happening live?  Why did they have to go there?  Well, there was a bus because I got thrown against it, but other than that, that's about  it.  You got thrown against it.  You certainly did.  There was actually quite a bit more.  My wife and my nine-year-old daughter were actually right next to me with Santa hats on  as well, but they weren't so quick running out, and they saw me get thrown, and they decided  we're going to turn around.  You know?  We're not going to be involved in this mess.  Yeah.  And my daughter shouted at the guy, why are you touching my dad? 
[00:26:30]  Well, that's great.  So then what happened after the cameras stopped rolling?  Well, you know, they just continued to shout at me, and I just walked away, which is pretty  much what I always do, because I'm not going to get into a fight with these guys.  Right.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Yeah, exactly.  So I got about half a block, and I set up my Santa hat on, and all of a sudden, my hat  got yanked over my head.  And I'm like, you know, I thought I was my wife just trying to be funny, but I turn around,  it's the reporter and this huge goon who has nothing to do with the show.  He just happened to be there.  I guess he was just trying to get laid with the reporter.  Wow.  You know, the reporter actually was taking some action on you there? 
[00:27:00]  She actually touched him.  She took my hat.  She never gave it back, either.  She got a nice souvenir.  Wow.  Get a DNA of it or something.  What'd she say?  She kept saying, she kept shouting at me, why are you doing this?  But she wouldn't let me get a word in edgeways.  You know how these fucking holes are.  They'd just go on and on.  She kept, you know, saying, why are you doing this?  I said, it's for a radio contest.  And I'm like, who do you work for?  I'm going to come to your job and harass you.  Take her down.  She's welcome.  Yeah, well, I was wearing an XM radio jacket, so I'm hoping she thinks that's where I work.  I told her I was unemployed.  She's like, how can you afford a cell phone if you're unemployed? 
[00:27:30]  I'm like, there's about $2,000 in prizes.  It's like, you know, call the show.  You don't know that dumb bitch, any explanation?  Stop standing in front of a bus acting like you're breaking news, stupid.  Sit in the studio.  Yeah.  Yes, I told her, call the show in the morning.  Call the show.  And then I had the phone open because, you know, Eric and you were listening, and I was trying  to make it so you could hear it all.  Yeah, you're making this sound very calm.  All I heard was screaming by the reporter and you yelling back at her.  Pandemonium.  And the whole time I'm going to E-Rock.  E-Rock, please tell me you're recording this, but he had no real means to record it, so. 
[00:28:00]  Well, you know, I actually posted that.  My wife actually recorded it on her camera phone.  The quality's awful, but there's three little clips where you can see them shouting at me,  and you can kind of hear it.  I posted it on WackBank.  All right.  Is it video?  Yeah, yeah, but it's camera phone video, so, you know, it's shit, but whatever.  Oh, it's really, really bad.  Yeah, but you can just see what's going on.  Well, Paul, I've got to tell you, man, what a great month you had.  Yeah, you know.  What a great month.  The boys are voting on who's going to win the Assault on the Media contest for November. 
[00:28:30]  How hard is it going to be for anybody to top the month of November?  New one starts today, but wow, Paul was just on fire.  You know what, though?  The prizes are getting better for December.  Yep.  The prizes are getting better for December.  We understand the greed factor with our listeners.  They want something for this, and we understand.  Sonny Ferelli, who's the current...  What are you doing?  He's the cup holder. 
[00:29:00]  He's the cup holder.  Oh, thanks, sir.  You rock.  He's on the line.  Sonny Ferelli.  Yeah, put him on.  Sonny.  Paul's a big, fat liar.  He's a fat cheater.  Why is he a cheater there?  You've got to hear this story.  I'll tell you what.  You know, you were talking about, you know, there's pests all over the place, you know.  So I get these PMs from about six or seven pests that are infiltrated inside these meteor outlets, you know.  And I got a message last night after I got a failed attempt on an attack on a meteor in a full Santa suit saying that somebody from New Jersey called and warned all the Boston meteor outlets that I was coming. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, there you go.  Do you think it was Paul ratting you out?  Yeah, it had to be.  It had to be.  Oh, man.  Oh, if they're starting to do this.  Yeah, this competition is getting fierce.  There's going to be a shooting.  You don't think the fact that Sonny was on an empty street outside a police station wearing a Santa suit and nobody else was there made it obvious? 
[00:30:00]  You don't think that was the reason he got caught yesterday?  Well, Sonny Pirelli posted on Wackbag last night.  It's quick.  Let me read this for everybody.  Because Sonny Pirelli, very, very smart.  The current cup holder, like Anthony said, he's won it, what, the last two months?  Right, yeah.  And he failed last night.  He likes to do these things last minute.  Yeah.  10 p.m. is out there.  Last minute he likes to, you know, hit them big.  And take the title.  He writes this on Wackbag last night.  Hello there, fellow Wackbaggers and friends at Fox 25.  What a night I've had. 
[00:30:30]  I just want to say this without going into a big, long message.  I will continue to do the assault on the media with all the stations, including Fox 25.  After tonight's botched episode, it should appear to both parties that what I am doing is not illegal.  The reporter even went into the police station to rat me out.  Then she came back out two minutes later and I was still there.  But the police figured they had got their man and I wasn't important enough to be dealt with.  During the time I was stating my case to the TWAT reporter, a patrol car did come by and stopped after he was flagged down by TWATO. 
[00:31:00]  He came out of his car and I explained myself to him.  At this time, he really had nothing to say other than to not do it to them again.  My reply was, yes, sir.  I will not do it to them in Winchester.  After which the cop had nothing to say about that comment.  Obviously, doing these assaults on the media is not illegal because if they were, I would have been arrested.  The next assault on the media I will be doing is going to be videotaped by a second party.  I hope that Fox 25 in Boston understands that I will no longer tolerate being touched. 
[00:31:30]  I have said countless times that I mean no harm and it's all in fun.  I will not pick stories that I think are inappropriate to hit.  I even offered the crew free XM radios new in the boxes and they didn't take them.  I really am a nice guy.  I just don't like the prima donna TWATs that act like my rotten spoiled sister and think they know everything because when it comes right down to it, they know jack shit.  Wow.  We're allowing bribery now.  We can actually pay off the channel to leave the camera on you.  So, Sonny, what happened?  You got roughed up last night. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  You know, I'm running down the street in a full standard suit.  I was actually hiding behind the Channel 5 van and they knew that I was hiding from them.  And then I got the okay from my spot of the glow hitting the camera.  So, I'm running down the street and all of a sudden, the guy that operates the equipment inside the van comes running out and puts his arms up against his shoulders and starts doing like body pick maneuvers and trying to keep me from getting into the shot, you know.  And she only got about five seconds in before she just completely dumped the shot. 
[00:32:30]  And they went to tape.  And she was pissed.  Yeah, these guys are making it tougher on us, huh?  Yep.  Oh, man.  All right, Sonny.  Well, you're going to lose your title.  That's obvious because I don't think you had an assault on the media this month officially.  No, no.  But I just wanted to put that in.  All right.  All right, guys.  Hey, Paul, you want me brick clock sucker?  We're going to rock.  I'll see you tomorrow, bro.  Yeah, bye.  Listen to these two awful accents going at it. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, I know.  Isn't that horrible?  Bye, Sonny.  Oh, there goes Sonny Farrelly.  Do you realize that's what it sounded like, the conversations that they had when, like,  the first English came over here and were colonizing up in Massachusetts?  And then the Limeys back there, like, trying to keep them in line?  That's what it sounded like?  Oh, what are you talking about?  No, it's our country.  You're just calling this over there.  All right, go fuck your mother, you motherfucking cocksucker.  It's our new fucking country. 
[00:33:30]  We're in charge over here.  Go fuck yourself.  Who do you think paid for all the ships?  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right, religious persecution.  Go fuck yourself.  You're a cocksucker.  Well, no filter, Paul.  It was a great night, man.  You kept me very entertained.  I'm glad you enjoyed it.  It was actually pretty cool to have you actually listening on that.  It was pretty cool.  It was pretty crazy.  Yeah.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  All right, once again.  By the way.  Yeah.  Oh, once again, Paul. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Once again, Paul, here's what he accomplished.  Last night, the video is up on opanthony.com.  Our top story this half hour, a pregnant woman taking a stand because she was denied a seat on a public bus.  There are bus seats that are designated for elderly, handicapped, or pregnant women.  But the 27-year-old mother-to-be was told to go to the back of the bus, and now she is fighting back.  Eyewitness News reporter, Kimberly Richardson, is live at the Port Authority with more.  Kimberly?  Well, Diana, there's no law saying you have to, but most degree doing so is just good manners. 
[00:34:30]  Hit me.  Hit me.  Excuse me.  That's right, stupid.  Right back to the tape.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Excuse me.  She's trying to, like, get him up.  Hit me.  Hit me.  Excuse me.  But then someone in the control room went, click.  Paul is great yelling, hit me.  Hit me.  He's great.  Right back to the tape, dummy.  What a ass.  We're going to announce the winner of the Assault on the Media Contest for November in a little while.  Some of the guys are still voting.  But you were saying it.  Right now, I will announce my daily winner of the person that is now up on my top eight. 
[00:35:00]  By the way, this is unfair.  It is not unfair.  Anybody that is my friend can spend a full day, 24 hours, up here making friends themselves.  But I don't have computer access during the show, so I can't bring new friends.  Because I did the same thing.  You have 20 hours of computer access.  If you would take one of those hours, take your cock out of your hand, get the porn off the screen, perhaps then you could do something. 
[00:35:30]  I don't say that that's not a valid point.  But I just think that I happen to have Ace Frehley a couple times came up as the lucky winner.  Ace Frehley, like he even knows who Jimmy Norton is.  He does.  He does not.  Anthony, I'm looking at your top eight, by the way.  I put the scariest individual ever.  I was going to tell you.  When this came in last night, I actually gasped and said,  Oh my God, this is the scariest person that has ever been on my space.  Yeah, Muffler.  His name is Muffler. 
[00:36:00]  He looks like he could be a real problem.  When you punch him up, he's 53 from Driscoll, Texas.  Jesus.  He's got no friends.  He's got the Tom guy who is the default friend when you set up an account.  Yeah.  It's like the owner of my space.  And me.  He looks like a manly, ripped torn.  He looks like a prison guy, like he's been in prison, like a lifer.  Yeah.  Like the guy that talks about how, well, you know, this is where I'm going to spend the rest of my life.  I know it.  And I shouldn't have killed that bus full of children.  I guarantee that his body has at least 75% tattoos. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, yeah.  At least.  He is a frightening individual.  He only has two friends.  One really, because everyone gets the Tom friend.  And me.  So I want to see, maybe Tom can make a few friends.  So I put him up there.  He is now on there for 24 hours.  Oh, you mean Muffler?  Muffler.  All right.  Yeah.  Tom is the other guy.  You just put him up there?  Just picked him out of nowhere.  And Nicky.  Because they've got to make a guy and a girl. 
[00:37:00]  I don't know who Nicky is.  Let's see what Nicky's all about.  Nicky has 37 friends.  Not that many.  I don't know.  What is she?  32 from Westchester, New York.  She has three kids.  Three kids.  10, 7, and 4.  And, well, she's a mom at 22.  She was a goer.  She works at a small community bank.  Yeah, she's one of those, you know, just your regular average kind of gal. 
[00:37:30]  You have three kids who you'd hate.  Of course.  I think she's a little too short to be your friend, though, Anthony.  How big is she?  She's five foot tall.  Just five foot?  Which means she's probably 4'10 and a half.  She's a little gal.  She's just a little thing.  Is she?  Just a little thing.  Went to high school in Shrub Oak, New York.  Yuck.  Yuck.  All right.  How about this?  I don't need to put them in the top eight because anyone that joins, here's what I'm going  to say.  All right.  Anyone that joins my space for my Jim Norton site, you get money. 
[00:38:00]  I send you money.  You cannot offer a cash bribe.  I send $50 a person and a hand-quilted note.  Or quilted.  Hand-quilted.  Hand-quilted note.  It's National AIDS Day.  Or International AIDS Day today, by the way.  Is it really?  Give me congratulations.  International AIDS Day.  Get some AIDS songs, man.  Quite a few years.  We're going to break with an AIDS song, then, of course.  Why is there an AIDS song?  I don't get it.  Huh?  Well, there's a... 
[00:38:30]  What kind of AIDS song?  No, no, no.  Not an AIDS song.  I'm sorry.  Not an AIDS song.  Why is there an AIDS day?  Because everyone need know about it.  We do.  And then talk about it.  Jesus.  You can't even go out and get fucked in the ass anymore without having to sweat and cry  for your next test.  Right.  I got a...  By the way, I got a nice robe yesterday.  Yeah?  Oh?  You guys didn't like your robes?  Matt Frost, the sports robe.  I love it.  Oh, the big, heavy Yankee robe.  I got Reggie Jackson.  It's phenomenal.  Yeah, aren't they heavy?  Yes.  And Terry Clothy.  Big, thick robe to walk around the house in, coughing and making their last phone 
[00:39:00]  calls.  I love it.  Getting everything in order.  You big ball of yarn in one pocket.  Tissues and sucretes in the other.  For that throat.  Gets parched.  Oh, all that coughing all day.  Yeah.  With that, we go to break with...  I'll do the Family Guy one, of course.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You got the AIDS. 
[00:39:30]  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex, but you hear.  It isn't clear, but what we're certain of is...  Is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS.  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  For full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry, I wish it was something less serious. 
[00:40:00]  But it's AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  Next time on a very special Everybody Loves Raymond, Ray's brother needs a helping hand.  Ray, I've got a problem, man.  You've got to help me.  No.  I picked up a tranny last night at Hunts Point, and there was an accident.  No.  We were trying this erotic asphyxiation thing. 
[00:40:30]  He, she was supposed to pinch me before it ran out of air.  What are you doing?  But Ray's father isn't buying it.  What a load of bull.  Come on.  All right, you got me.  I picked him up on 10th Avenue.  The family hijinks don't stop there.  Ray, you've got to help me get rid of the body.  I don't want to do it.  No, come on.  It'll be fun.  We'll chop it up and bury it out in Jersey.  I live on Long Island.  All on the next Everybody Loves Raymond, tonight at 8. 
[00:41:00]  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  For the newbies, it's the ONA virus, and it's spreading across America.  And now spreading into Canada.  A big hi to XM Canada, man.  Salute, Canada.  Ben finally made an appearance in the studio.  So goddamn funny. 
[00:41:30]  And his sweater definitely didn't disappoint.  Stupid body glove.  He comes in, apparently, and he wasn't listening.  What, is he going surfing?  Apparently, he wasn't listening to the show or something, because he walks in and he goes,  Someone say something about my shirt.  I got like 25 emails.  It's like I'm on the phone, people, and I'm getting emails.  It looks like if you take a child's sweater and put it over a fully inflated beach ball, 
[00:42:00]  and that's what it looks like.  It is not meant for Ben's little body.  It's awful.  Stop buying mediums, fat tits.  You know, I came in here once with a small sweater, and I got abused.  I went home and probably threw out 20 things.  You cannot wear tight-fitting sweaters unless you have a looser-fitting shirt over it, perhaps.  Well, unless you're in great shape.  In great shape.  Look, no, I'm just looking for a way to cover it up. 
[00:42:30]  It's like, yeah, great shape is a good option, too.  Here's the rule.  And, you know, we love Ben.  He's a hard worker.  But you're not allowed to wear a tight sweater if you haven't done a sit-up since 1994.  94?  I don't think he's ever done a sit-up.  Do you think he's done a sit-up?  Well, it was probably...  Yes, you're correct.  Getting off the floor doesn't count.  Closing time doesn't count.  It says 83.  Closing time.  He probably didn't even do the sit-up.  He rolled over to get up. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, he was like a lamb.  He couldn't get off his back.  He got a sheep.  Half a push-up.  Rebbed onto the bar stool to get back up the whole way.  A bunch of men picked him up by his hair.  Oh, come on.  Time to leave.  Hey, it's Ben's song.  That was...  The soundtrack to Ben's last sit-up.  An old wooden floor covered with fear and dirt. 
[00:43:30]  Half his hair is sawduster.  Pretzel crumbs from the bar.  Yeah, he's still got like a half-lit cigar in his other little cans.  Coaster on his belly.  His shirt's all askew.  His guts.  Look at that.  Closing time.  Closing time.  One last call for a while.  Everyone's gone.  I just said the top racist. 
[00:44:00]  Closing time.  You've got to fucking go home, you co-sucker.  But you can't stay.  All right.  Let's say how to Craig in New Jersey.  Craig, what's going on today?  Hey, man.  What's up, Craig?  That reminds me of Boogie Nights with Philip Seymour Hoffman.  My shopper clothes.  He bought the same shirt.  That is exactly the way he looks, except Ben's does cover to his belt.  That's exactly the fit.  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Good call. 
[00:44:30]  Do you want to kiss me on the mouth?  Do you want to kiss me?  You got the touch.  What the fuck is an idiot?  You got the power.  What the fuck is an idiot?  Hello, exactly.  Okay.  Yeah.  You look like assholes right now, man.  Asterole is said and done.  You never want to never run.  He was so into it.  God, that was a great suit. 
[00:45:00]  The whole movie is just great.  Yeah, man.  All right.  Enough of that.  That is great.  It's perfectly lyrically awful.  Yeah.  It's perfectly awful. 
[00:45:30]  And the way he sings it is awful.  Marky Mark...  And to watch John...  What's his name?  McGinley's name is...  The guy who played his partner dancing in the other room?  Like he was really getting down.  Into it.  Fucking hilarious.  Yeah, this is going to make us millions, man.  But the magic...  The magic is ours.  You look like assholes right now, man.  I'm going to have to watch that again.  All right.  Guys, just when you thought the bit was dead... 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  We got some good Dickie Goodmans that came in.  Yes.  We were ready to bail on this, but...  You need a few people to step up and get the...  Get what it's all about.  Right.  Embrace the spirit of the bit.  Good old Dickie Goodman came up with these...  Save it.  These hack songs.  Well, I guess they were comedy bits.  I don't know.  Like little comedy bits, yeah, that used songs of the day.  Right.  Whatever song was popular at the time he did them.  Did one on Watergate.  On Jaws. 
[00:46:30]  Jaws was, I think, his most famous one.  Yeah.  Where he would play the news reporter in all of these things.  And he would ask questions like a news reporter would, but the answers are supplied by musical  lyrics.  That's right.  Right.  Who thought this would be a good idea?  Wow.  Dickie Goodman.  The songs were all over the radio at the time.  Yeah.  And eventually Dickie Goodman took a bullet to the head.  Yeah.  When Dickie finally looked back on his career in a moment of clarity and saw what it amounted  to, he thought the only resolution for him was to take a gun, put it to his head, and pull 
[00:47:00]  the trigger.  Yes.  Well, we have three new ones that came in.  Three new ones.  We start with P. Niggity.  All right.  His is entitled Bitch Whore Chef.  Oh, I can see where this one's going.  Wonderful.  Thank you, Bill Burr.  We are here in the servants' quarters of the Kumia Mansion, speaking with Anthony's 
[00:47:30]  Whore Bitch Chef.  Hello, Whore Bitch Chef.  Hello, hello.  Can you give us an example of a meal you might cook for Mr. Kumia?  Come sing a pizza pie.  What does Anthony eat for breakfast?  Candy.  Whore Bitch Chef, how do you respond to Bill Burr's allegation of an affair between yourself  and Mr. Kumia?  Right, right, right, yeah.  Well, I guess that settles that.  Here comes Mr. Kumia now.  Mr. Kumia, do you think I have a future in radio? 
[00:48:00]  Do you really think so?  I don't think so.  Mr. Kumia, do you have any advice for me?  Mr. Kumia, what are you doing with that shotgun?  This record wasn't supposed to air this way.  See?  There you go.  Short, sweet.  He did the voice right.  That's what we're looking for right there.  That's it.  That's a great example.  Topical.  Topical has something to do with the show.  The songs made sense to the questions he was asking.  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  See, people?  It can be done.  That's right.  The next one came in from Snapman.  From Whackbag.  All right.  And I don't like this one.  You don't like this one?  I don't like this one.  Why?  What's it entitled?  Interview with Opie.  All right.  I can see why you don't like it already.  I don't really like this one.  I'm here with Greg Opie Hughes from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Say, Opie, what's that cereal you're eating?  Lean on me.  Is there any other cereal you like to eat?  And how do those cereals make you feel? 
[00:49:00]  I feel pretty and witty and gay.  Opie, you often roll a blade around Central Park.  What do you do when you take off your roller blades?  West End.  Opie, you seem like a really tough person.  But is there anyone who made you run and hide like a little girl?  Pretty girl.  Opie, you have a pretty young girlfriend.  Just how old is she?  She's only seven to me.  And why is she going out with you?  Money.  That's all the time we have for today.  What did you think of the interview, Opie? 
[00:49:30]  I want to kill you.  I want to blow you away.  Well, in that case, I'm going to run and hide like a little girl.  There you go.  All right.  That's very funny.  That's Snap Man from Whack Bag.  Excellent.  Actually, another great example of what we're looking for as far as these Dickie Goodman bits go.  The voice.  Great.  I think this bit might survive for a little longer after all.  And then the third one that came in overnight is from Anthony's Brother Joe. 
[00:50:00]  Brother Joe threw one together.  Look at that, earning his money.  He did one on Andrea Yates.  All right.  This one.  Suggested this.  This one is brutal.  Strap in, kids.  This one is brutal.  Good evening.  Hey, I'm here taking a dump in the Yates bathroom with Andrea and her five little fuck-ups at bath time. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, little Yateses.  What's going on here?  Splish, splash.  I was taking the bath.  Mrs. Yates, you crazy cunt.  What was that you're just whispering in your daughter's ear?  Got you in a strangler's, baby.  Hey, little Yates girl.  Where are you going in that tub of death?  Down, down, down, down, down.  I'm sorry.  Can you repeat that?  I couldn't hear you with all that water in your little lungs.  I'm going down, down, down, down, down. 
[00:51:00]  Mrs. Yates, we know you're nuttier than a shit after eating 25 Snickers bars, but what do you think your children are?  Three little fishies in a itty-bitty pool.  Mrs. Yates, what are your children's names?  Sully, Jenny, Escobeble, and Boopy-doopy-doop.  Don't you realize they're the fruit of your loins?  Three little fishes, and the mama fishie, too.  Uh-oh.  The little Yates boy isn't looking so good.  What's that coming out of his nose?  Tiny baboon.  Oh, my God. 
[00:51:30]  Andrea, I notice you're using a very gentle shampoo on their little heads.  Is that Johnson & Johnson's...  Well, in that case, maybe you're not the worst mother in the world.  Hey, little baby Yates, how did you feel as mommy squeezed the last bit of life out of your tiny defenseless body?  First, I was afraid.  I was petrified.  Andrea, you kooky, homicidal twat.  How come you showed less emotion through this whole ordeal than an Asian hooker?  Hey, girl. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, I hate you.  Well, Mrs. Yates, you've finally done it, and all five of your children are dead.  What are you going to do when their dad comes home?  Celebrate your time.  Come on.  Let's celebrate.  Thank you for allowing me to take a shit in your den of death, Mrs. Yates.  Any final words before I wipe my ass and get the fuck out of here?  Well, that's it.  Till next time, Dickie Goodman, with no comedy on my mind and a big fucking bullet hole in my head. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, my God.  Okay, terrific.  Jesus Christ.  And, of course...  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, dear Lord.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  That was brutal.  I don't remember Dickie cursing so much in his songs.  No.  I don't remember.  Played on, like, WNBC.  The reporters are usually a little straight.  Like, they're kind of straight men. 
[00:53:00]  The reporters don't comment on what the shit might look like after X amount of name-brand candy bars.  All right.  What happened, Jimmy?  What happened?  Oh, this book is funny.  What happened?  What are you thumbing through, Jimmy?  It's a book called Sinful Nims.  Sinful Nims.  Sinful Nims.  Well, what a coincidence.  You're enjoying the book, and I believe the author is going to call in today. 
[00:53:30]  It's a scintillating collection of hilarious adult acronyms.  Is that happening today?  Yes, at 8.15.  It's scintillating, but sin, S-I-N, and scintillating is, like, slanted, so it kind of leaps out at you.  Mm-hmm.  And there's, like, uh, let's see.  Uh, let me find a word.  Uh, if.  The word if.  If.  If.  It stands for I'm fucked. 
[00:54:00]  All right, and there's a cartoon, though.  Uh-huh.  It's a guy looking at two larger gentlemen in a prison.  Shower.  Oh, oh, so.  This is a good one.  It says,  Mate.  Munch a twat every day.  That's mate.  And it's got a cartoon of a gal on her back. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  And a man wearing a thing on his neck about to munch her twat.  Like a little thing you'd put around, like a napkin type thing, or a bib.  Yeah.  What is the point of this?  Like, we're going to find out when we need to do the author.  We're going to talk to him.  You take a word.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, then you, you take the words acronym.  Mm-hmm.  And then you, uh, you make up what it would stand for you.  Well, it's a, yeah, yeah.  Well, these are hilarious adult acronyms. 
[00:55:00]  And, um, the, the quote on the back is too naughty, too clever, and just too damn funny  to be put down by James Oscar Barrows.  From what publication is that review?  Uh, there is none.  There isn't.  So it's like his friend.  It's probably his friend, yes.  But there's three names.  That sounds more official.  Wow.  Well, we'll talk to him when he calls it.  I just haven't laughed at some of these adults.  Well, it should be a fine interview.  That's coming up at 8.15 on the OPNF.  This interview would normally be done on a Wednesday, I think, right?  But today is, uh, Thursday.  Years ago, we would have done this on a Wednesday. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  But, uh, today's, okay.  Do it today.  I can't even understand what he's saying.  I don't know.  He's, he's, he's whispering secret codes to Arthur.  What?  We can't read lips.  I said, do you want a blowjob?  Shut up.  Let's go to John in Utah.  John, what's going on?  Yeah, there's, uh, there's another Dickie Goodman song, Christmas one, that I heard on  the, uh, the, uh, weird, uh, Christmas channel you guys got here. 
[00:56:00]  Are you kidding?  It's, uh, an interview with Santa.  You guys got to hunt that one down.  An interview with Santa.  Hawks on it.  It, it, it, it's, it's traditionally, it's a traditional Dickie Goodman horrible wreck,  but you, you guys got to have that too.  I had no idea that there was a, uh.  Yeah, there's a Christmas one.  A Christmas one.  We're looking for it right now.  All right, punch it out.  All right, thank you.  Santa and the satellite?  Santa, there's a, there's a few of them.  All Dickie Goodman? 
[00:56:30]  Santa and the Touchables?  Want to just try one of these, see what it sounds like?  I don't know.  Try the first one, I guess.  This book is the worst.  No, it's going to be good.  It's going to be good at 815, Anthony.  It's going to be good.  Let's play this real fast.  We interrupt this record for an important news bulletin.  Santa Claus is missing from the North Pole.  Be on the lookout for Santa Claus.  Last scene.  Sitting here, la-la, waiting for my ya-ya. 
[00:57:00]  Washington has decided this is a job for the Touchables.  December 1961.  At the headquarters of Elliott Press and the Touchables.  Take the halls without the funny.  Ba-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Sent to the North Pole.  The Touchables learn that someone has launched a toy spaceship.  Sending Santa to the moon.  Alvin the Chipmunk says...  Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer volunteers to lead the Touchables to the rescue.  A new spaceship is ready for blast-off.  Three, two, one, zero. 
[00:57:30]  Okay, Alvin.  Alvin.  Chipmunks.  Chipmunks are always funny.  Alvin!  Alvin!  Successfully landing on the moon, Rudolph and the Touchables are surrounded by the moon men.  The leader of the moon men approaches Elliott Press and says...  Which translated means... 
[00:58:00]  But the Touchables are not leaving without Santa Claus.  After a brief battle, Elliott Press looks up and says...  Meanwhile, Rudolph secretly leads Santa Claus to the spaceship.  Out of gas, the Touchables harness Rudolph to the ship.  And away they go.  Watch out!  There we go again.  When was this made?  1950?  That was in the 60s? 
[00:58:30]  That is awful.  That is so bad.  That's actually the song on Anthony's MySpace page.  It is not.  It is.  And I would tell anybody, go and see that it is not.  All right, go ahead.  C-U-M-M-I-A.  Call me a...  No!  Jim Norton.  You are really trying to undermine me.  I'm not.  Listen, let's get...  My efforts.  You're very famous.  That is awful.  That is really, really bad.  Our listeners are coming up with better ones.  Were they for kids, though?  Was that a kid's one or not?  Like for Alvin and the Chipmunks?  No.  It was for retards. 
[00:59:00]  People, adults liked Alvin and the Chipmunks back then.  They are cute.  Well, there's another one.  There's another Christmas one.  Maybe this is the one he was talking about.  The Touchables.  Hit it.  Here is a news bulletin.  Santa Claus has been kidnapped by spacemen from a flying saucer, which landed at the North Pole.  Be on the lookout for Santa Claus.  It's the same one, right?  You play that same one again, Hawk, and I'll smash that monitor off your teeth.  No, it's...  He didn't...  It's listed differently. 
[00:59:30]  You tell him to fix it.  It's listed like it could be a different one.  Fix it.  No, we don't.  But it's not.  But it's not.  It's right.  The Touchables.  Just standing on a bunch of kids.  That guy made a career off of doing that.  And then realized that and took a bullet to the head.  Blew his head off.  That's so great.  One little soundtrack he was listening to and that bullet ripped his brains all over the wall.  What a justified...  Wait, there's one for killing.  There's one for Kong.  And now with the new movie coming out, this is topical.  This came in the 70s.  When the remake was made, I guess. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, boy.  This has got to be really bad.  Strap in, kids.  Oh, I can't take the...  I probably will not be able to handle this.  Ah, there's a giant monkey running loose.  And look what he's saying.  Here we go.  We're here on Skull Island where a 40-foot gorilla has just kidnapped Juan, a young actress.  Hey, Kong!  What did you tell her?  The night's the night.  And what did she say to you? 
[01:00:30]  You've got a cute way of talking.  When do you intend to let her go?  After love and love.  Juan, if you can hear me up there, what advice do you have for someone who was kidnapped by a 40-foot gorilla?  Thank you, Juan.  Juan, okay.  Kong, you're going to New York to do a concert.  While you're there, where are you going to take a bath?  One last question before you go. 
[01:01:00]  What do you call that weird way you walk?  We are here in New York where the stadium is filled.  Kong, what do you feel like with all these people around?  Just another new kid and girl.  Ah, ah, stop.  Kong is breaking loose.  He doesn't want to do the concert.  Juan, say something to him.  You don't have to be a star, baby.  He's heading for the World Trade Center. 
[01:01:30]  We'll have to get help to stop this monkey.  Hot blood, hot blood.  Calling off a hot blood.  Kong has reached the Trade Center.  He's climbing to the top.  Kong, what are you doing up there?  Why is it something nasty on the wall?  We are here with Kong on top of the World Trade Center.  Army helicopters are shooting at him.  Unfortunately, he wasn't up there in September 11th.  Kong is shouting something up at them.  Hand me down my walking cane.  Hand me down my hand.  Tragedy is Dickie Goodman was killed. 
[01:02:00]  Kong, have you any last words to say to Juan?  Where will I hold you again?  He's starting to fall.  Hey, Kong, you're on my foot.  We're falling.  Kong, Kong, Kong.  The record wasn't spoken this way.  Oh, he's falling.  Jeez, going to do it all day. 
[01:02:30]  Holy cow.  That was, I can't even say it anymore.  How bad.  He actually handed that in to somebody.  Hey, what is this against my temple?  It's a Luger.  Oh, my God.  Wow, am I glad he shot himself.  Oh, I couldn't be happier if someone's suicide.  You know what?  With the new Kong movie coming out,  we should take the original Dickie Goodman.  Yeah.  And we'll rework the clips. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, of course.  The song clips.  We'll make it better.  Yuck.  That could be really good.  I wonder if his family,  what they said when they shot himself,  they're probably all secretly relieved.  Like, we don't have to sit around  and awkwardly smile at these.  Thank God.  Awkwardly.  I have a new one.  Here it is, family.  And there he is.  Pops in the table and they all go, huh?  And they wouldn't even,  it was so unfunny.  And they'd say things like,  I like that song.  I like that song.  That part with the, 
[01:03:30]  when you were falling.  No.  I really got the image that you were falling.  And it made me so fucking happy.  Oh, no.  Something is spilled on my floor.  It's brain matter.  Yeah, we could do one on Dickie Goodman.  Oh, that's great.  Bullet in the head.  Right.  Sure.  Yeah.  Hey, man, nice shot.  Hey, man, nice shot.  Yeah, hey.  Shot to the heart.  No, it's just to his head, man.  It doesn't matter.  It's his shot.  There's very few songs that say, uh. 
[01:04:00]  Shot to the head.  Unfunny man kills himself.  Hit me with your best shot.  Yep.  Oh, man, we might have to work today.  Hmm.  And put this thing together.  Let's make it.  Let's make a song, boys.  Why don't we open it up to the listeners?  Like we always do.  Yeah, we're just idea men.  And then you guys take it and run.  Let's make a record.  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey, Eric.  Hey, there's one of those Dickie Goodman ones that he did about the oil crisis also. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  The big oil crisis?  He was just a hit in the 70s, wasn't he?  Yeah, because the interview was with, like, King Faisal and Gold in My Ear and somebody else.  Oh, all the relevant topical people from 1974.  Let me ask you, Dickie, when did he shoot himself?  Uh, I believe it was in the 80s.  I don't think we, I think we can just answer that question by listening to this music.  Yeah, no kidding.  No, no, not why, but when.  I'm saying, like, what, did he try a hit in the 80s?  People were so into Wall Street and doing coke. 
[01:05:00]  They're like, look, you irrelevant douchebag.  Just fucking drop that around.  Yeah, what was his last song that he really tried to, uh, something with Reagan?  I think there was one in the 80s, but I don't, I'm not positive.  But the 70s channel played these damn things all the time.  Well, they were huge in the 70s.  Yeah, they were very popular.  So.  Yeah, when they were doing It, you know, the decade run through, I think they played, like,  10 or 15 of them.  Oh.  Wow.  Can we get a Dickie Goodman CD?  There has to be a Greatness Hits.  Yeah, boys. 
[01:05:30]  All right, thank you.  Do you think he had dreams of a box set?  He didn't know what that was, but he knew he wanted greatness beyond what he would reach.  Yeah.  Let's go to Guy in.  His dream was a pine box set.  Yes.  I just want to be awarded a satin pillow.  Guy in Connecticut.  Head like a hole.  Yeah.  Like a nail.  Head like a hole.  Let's see what the listeners could come up with first.  That's a good one.  And then if they don't do a good job, then we'll go into the production room and actually  work.  All right, thank you, Guy. 
[01:06:00]  No problem.  And then they're saying there's, uh, this one that he came up with.  Tim?  Yo.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, um, I remember a song back in the 80s, around the time that E.T., the movie came  out.  Yeah.  And, uh, I don't know if it was Dickie Goodman, but it was somebody that did the Dickie Goodman  style.  And one of the lines was, E.T. wants to phone home, but E.T., how do you call outer space?  And then they played the clip of the, uh, Tommy Two-Tone song.  The 8-6-7-5-3-0-9. 
[01:06:30]  Watch out, boy.  Oh, I wish we could get that.  I can't find that one either.  Oh.  Uh, there is a Greatest Hits, though.  Two.  Two Greatest Hits.  Two Greatest Hits.  Wow.  One called Greatest Fables by Dickie Goodman.  Ew.  Released in 1997.  Fables.  Fable.  And then The King of Novelty, Greatest Fables.  Fables?  I don't think Aesop shot himself on a linoleum floor.  Volume Two.  He had a Volume Two, everyone.  Volume Two. 
[01:07:00]  Is there a track listing for these, uh?  There's gotta be a way to get these online.  Uh, yeah.  Let's see the track listing.  A little more Dickie.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my.  Are you kidding me?  What?  Sweetie, what?  How many songs are there?  All right, wait.  Go back.  There's like 30 of them.  Return of the Flying Saucer, Flying Saucer Part One, Flying Saucer Part Two, Flying Saucer  the Second, Flying Saucer the Third, Flying Saucer Goes West.  It was a biggie.  Santa and the Satellite, Santa and the Satellite Part Two, Santa and the Touchables. 
[01:07:30]  So those are all different songs, by the way.  The Touchables, the Touchables in Brooklyn, Ben Crazy, Batman and His Grandmother, The Ride  of Paul Revere, Frankenstein of 59, Frankenstein Returns, Get a Job on Campus, Luna Trip,  Watergate, Mr. President, Energy Crisis, Mr. Jaws, go down.  Holy shit, there's 40 tracks on this thing.  It goes on and on.  40 tracks, no laughs.  Super Superman, Return of the Jedi Returns, Hey E.T., Attack of the Z Monster, Election 84, 
[01:08:00]  and horror movies.  Wow.  And Safe Sex Report.  Wow, someone's got to get this and go through some of these.  And then after the last track, like they did on Elvis' Last Life CD, they have when Vern  came on and made the speech.  Thank you for listening.  That was the last recording of my son Elvis.  I hope that's how Dickie Goodman's ends.  Maybe his wife or bereaved child comes on.  Wow.  Embarrassed child.  That was my daddy.  You want to hear Ben crazy? 
[01:08:30]  I don't even...  No, I was just saying that I found the rest of them.  Oh, you found the rest of them?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Do you have the E.T. one?  Oh, shit.  No.  Hawk, we have the Energy Crisis 74, though.  That was...  Want to hear just a piece of this one?  I want to hear all of it.  I'm sure it's good.  I'm having some laughs.  It's too long, though.  We'll play a little bit of this.  Listen.  We are here at the White House for a special report on the Energy Crisis.  We're here.  We're here.  Are you...  I didn't understand.  Why was Kong stepping on his foot and then they fell together? 
[01:09:00]  How did that happen?  I don't know.  And why wouldn't Kong stepping on his foot bring him a little more pain?  And why would it knock him off the building?  Right.  Wouldn't that keep him anchored?  I don't get it.  Yeah, I don't get it.  Who are these people?  Maybe because...  I don't know.  All right.  Let's back up there.  Because we've got to hear the we're here again.  We are here at the White House for a special report on the Energy Crisis.  Mr. President, have you any statements?  Leave me alone.  Leave me alone.  Just leave me alone.  Mr. President, what really caused the energy crisis? 
[01:09:30]  Smoking in the boys' room.  During the crisis, how much gas will motorists be allowed?  Just enough for the city.  Who do you believe the gas shortage will affect most?  L.A.  L.A.  L.A.  L.A.  L.A.  L.A.  L.A.  L.A.  L.A.  L.A.  L.A.  What do you intend to do?  With me now is the head of the Federal Energy Office. 
[01:10:00]  Sir, you hold an important position.  What are your qualifications?  I'm a joker.  I'm a smoker.  I'm a real life.  Mr. President, have you anything to add?  Here with me is the new Vice President, Chevy Ford.  Sir, how would you sum up the gas shortage?  Sir, how would you sum up the gas shortage?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  A new noise. 
[01:10:30]  We have a long-distance call from Saudi Arabia.  King Faisal, is that you?  Hello, it's me.  King Faisal, what are your thoughts when you look out at all those oil wells?  You're beautiful, and you're mine.  I have gold in my ear of Israel on the other phone.  Gold in my ear.  What should I tell her?  Won't you tell her that I love you?  Ah, ha, ha.  Carly Price.  Mr. President, have you any added comment?  Leave me alone.  Leave me alone.  Leave me alone. 
[01:11:00]  Mr. President, the American people are waiting.  Have you a statement?  Why?  Why would that mean?  We'd like to continue this record on the energy crisis.  But we have just run out of energy.  Hey, that's pretty clever.  That's funny.  That's a clever ending right there.  That's clever.  See, they ran out of energy.  Very clever for 1974.  And he shouldn't quite finish it up.  Why? 
[01:11:30]  What happened?  I thought it should end like, well, we'd like to finish this interview.  You know, that would have been more appropriate.  Just when you thought the Dickie Goodman story couldn't get any better, we have Bob in North  Carolina with some information.  I was hoping it was Bob Goodman.  Bob?  Bob?  Bob?  We're here with Bob.  Bob?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, I think I remember when I was listening to the Stupid Laugh USA channel that Dickie Goodman's 
[01:12:00]  son, if I'm not mistaken, started making the records like his dad did.  Oh, no.  Hopefully he suffered the same fate.  But I don't know.  We didn't hurt dad's business.  That was a proud moment for this kid.  Absolutely.  All right, Bob.  I'm out.  I'm going to follow in your father's footsteps right until you're slumping to the corner  of a wall in a motel alone.  With brain matter behind you. 
[01:12:30]  Listening to your own unfunny dreck.  At least I had a little Charlie Rich in there.  Oh, guys, we've got to call the author.  So why don't we take a break?  Oh.  Well, coming up next, we've got an exclusive interview with the author from Sinful Nims.  Sinful Nims?  Sir, what are sinful nims?  Serious questions only for the author.  And our good pal Jay Moore is here.  Where is Jay?  I just saw him walk by the glass.  I didn't see him.  Where is he?  He'll be joining the program next. 
[01:13:00]  Hope he really doesn't care about our lives.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  And I hate you all.  Oh.  Ah.  You've got to have me.  Look, Jerky, I don't need to talk to you.  All right, kids.  Hold on your hats.  One, two, three.  Ow.  Show close, monkey ass.  Show close, monkey ass. 
[01:13:30]  Monkey ass.  Who's the man?  Sonny, Sonny.  Who's the man?  Who's the man?  Who's the man?  You think it's John Kimball?  Who's the man?  You're such a mess.  It's our show, you tool. 
[01:14:00]  You're so tender.  I knew this was a stick.  You're so tender.  Unbelievable.  I can't go on.  Opie and Anthony.  Come on.  It's not funny anymore.  You can stop.  You can stop. 
[01:14:30]  Jay Moore.  It's Jay Moore in the studio.  Jay Moore.  How you been, bro?  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Hey, what's up?  Yes, Jay Moore has entered the studio.  Yeah.  We were just talking music outside there. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, yeah?  What were you?  We just saw Paul McCartney.  How was that?  The band?  The band does not get shirts.  Bunch of fucking hacks jumping around, thinking to the center of attention with Paul McCartney  on stage.  Shouldn't they just sit there and play the fucking music, right?  Yeah, like, no one knows who the Stones bassist is.  No one's going to step up.  Like a good black guy.  Edge of the stage and start riffing and thinking that people are looking at him.  When, you know, during the entire show, everyone's eyes are just looking at the Beatle.  Of course.  No, they weren't. 
[01:15:30]  Because these guys were so offensive.  Really?  The guitarist was, like, doing, like, half splits and kicks.  Stop it.  And the drummer...  I won't even believe that.  No, the drummer was, like, a big, fat Samoan guy.  And he's doing, like, English tea, which is, like, a little song by himself on the piano.  And the drummer's doing, like, a fake, like, conductor thing during the whole...  Why would they do that?  Because they have this crazy sense of entitlement.  Like, they have to be the center of attention.  But Paul can wield an iron fist.  He does it whenever there's a piece of leather on a stool. 
[01:16:00]  The stool's got to be removed from the fucking studio.  But he must be on the stage.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  Just fling big stakes up at Paul McCartney as he plays?  Do you think his wife has a leg closet?  Because she has all different legs.  Like, she has legs and she paints the nails.  I snuck them.  You think she's got one for running, one for walking.  She does have one for running.  Yeah, that one with the little titanium spring on it or something.  One that bends behind the ear so he can really feel like he's fucking a complete person.  She's got to have a vacation leg that's tanned, one with a bruise. 
[01:16:30]  One with a bruise.  Like, ah, remember when I was walking through the restaurant and I cut my hip on the table?  But the band, the guitarist, during one of the applause breaks,  flipped his guitar over and on the back and tape it said, thanks.  Wow.  Like, I said, I have to go.  Like, I have to leave or I'm going to fucking rush the stage and kill these people.  Yeah, thanks.  I've felt that way since Neil Diamond, who I got way too stoned and thought he looked 
[01:17:00]  too much like Bill Murray in Kingpin.  I was like, wow.  I'm going to sever his head.  I just don't like the way he sings the songs anymore.  I want it to sound like the records.  I don't want to hear, you know, I want to,  Sweet Caroline, good times never seem so good.  And he goes, Sweet Caroline!  I go where the noise is.  Good times never seem so good! 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  It's not the way you sang it on the fucking record.  Bunch of fucking agents.  How do you know?  I've heard live.  A bunch of Jason Steinberg's in the front row.  Never saw live Neil Diamond.  I would go and see live Neil Diamond.  Just for goof.  You know what?  I saw Tom Jones, for God's sake.  Yeah, but here's the thing, and Jimmy will understand this.  I'm all for kitsch and goof.  Yeah.  But the second night selling out Staples Center,  the performer in me gets very jealous and I want to murder him.  Oh, is that it?  As a performer?  If you've ever written a song in 30 years and you're selling out Staples Center, 
[01:18:00]  you fucking asshole.  You can't even look at me?  Like, you're just fucking walking through I Am I Said?  Like, you're just faking it?  Like, you're just going?  I am I said.  Is that Jay Moore?  He goes, uh...  Jay Moore, this one's for you.  I am I cry.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I did a movie called The Jazz Singer.  And one of the best parts of doing a major motion picture  is having to write new songs.  I'd like to play for you some of these new songs. 
[01:18:30]  That's what he fucking said before I Am I Said.  And Jay Moore's in the front row.  He said, I want to play for you these new songs before this song.  Really?  And he was dressed like a professional bowler.  I was thinking, wow, Stephen Lynch should rewrite the fucking song.  The bowling song?  The one he hates, that's the best song.  The bowling song rocks.  He likes it on a personal level because he knows all the bowling. 
[01:19:00]  I saw him recently here in New York.  They're still screaming out to play the bowling song because of us.  What about the FBI?  He doesn't do the FBI.  Why?  He just doesn't do the FBI.  No.  And it's, uh...  It's, uh...  What?  International AIDS Day today?  It is, uh...  AIDS Day today.  I just saw up on the news.  They had a big banner.  They were doing a big celebration at Bryant Park here in New York.  And you know what the sign said?  It was a bunch of people and it said, everybody has AIDS.  Like...  What? 
[01:19:30]  Where's the cricket?  What the fuck was that supposed to mean?  It did.  There you go.  Come on.  How'd you miss that one?  That's what it said.  A little slow today.  We're all touched by it and affected.  I suppose so.  Especially some of us that receive oral sex and people who may be more likely to have  it.  Like...  Let me tell you.  Brazilian trends.  I'm a lucky motherfucker then because I have not even been flicked by the AIDS virus in  any way, shape, or form.  The beauty of you is you'll get it by accident like in a hospital.  Does that happen?  Yeah.  You'll just get like a bad needle or something. 
[01:20:00]  You're faithful.  You'll have a clean life.  You'll just wind up with the hiv.  Alcohol swab.  Take some blood tests.  Oops.  Oh no.  That was in the Haitian fire.  You were supposed to throw that needle away.  Oops.  And Jay Moore's also wearing a Black Crowes t-shirt.  Still one of the greatest bands out there.  Very good.  I saw that.  Now that they're back together.  Now that the brothers aren't fighting anymore.  Rich Robinson's a real fucking wet blanket douchebag.  How about in between Greasy Grass River and my morning song, I got to watch Rich Robinson  do an acoustic number. 
[01:20:30]  No, you don't.  Yeah, you don't.  That's when you get up and go get a beverage.  No, you can.  It's standing room only.  They're playing like the size of this room.  Really?  That's really weird.  I saw them at the Greek theater with Oasis and Space Hog, which was super cool.  Space Hog is a cool man.  The two is the fucking one to see this year.  That was crazy.  And then you text message the one campaign.  Yeah, yeah.  And then your phone rings and it's, hi, this is Bono.  Yeah.  That was freaky, dude.  It was pretty cool.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He's got people signing up during the concert for this thing he's trying to do. 
[01:21:00]  Really?  Trying to get rid of World Hunger.  Yeah.  Play your fucking music.  No, is it World Hunger?  No, no, no, no.  It's a debt thing.  Bono gets a free pass.  Bono does not get a free pass with his political agenda.  Why don't you erase a third of Africa's debt?  What?  He didn't put it in the debt.  That's what you say when you have no idea what to say back.  Yes, I have something to say back.  I know what he did.  He went over.  What?  He's talking to world leaders and saying, erase their fucking debt.  What?  And they did.  What were they going to do?  Well, they weren't going to get it anyway.  They did. 
[01:21:30]  It's like going out and going, hey, that homeless guy owes you money.  You know something?  Ah, fuck it.  Like he was going to pay you anyway.  But officially, Bono, because you're fucking being condescending.  But officially, you're sitting there going, that's what they say.  What?  What?  Yeah, but officially.  I don't sit here and take it anymore.  But officially, they don't have to pay.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm banning you.  Where's Bill Burr?  He's going to turn your mic off.  Bill Burr got me in that mindset where I'm not sitting here and taking shit anymore.  It seems like every time he bans somebody, you go, no, you can't ban that guy. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, I know.  Thanks, Bill.  Thanks, Bill.  Thanks for tearing down the 8th wall.  Good job.  As far as Bono's concerned, how about the Africans just pay their debts?  How about they pay their debts?  How about they learn how to grow something like fucking wheat?  Exactly.  And start wearing condoms.  And water it.  Stop putting the machetes down.  Stop hacking your people apart.  Stop putting truck tires filled with gas around their necks and lighting them on fire to make a statement.  And that's...  And, I don't know, kill a pig and feed your village.  Thank you.  Right.  That's what I say.  Between family and village. 
[01:22:30]  The whole village.  The very last second.  The whole village is their fucking family.  Village.  I meant village.  That's how they say it in Africa.  Bud and the pig in the fluent African.  Village.  Everything edible they worship, fucking savages.  Oh, Bono did a great thing, though.  And the show was good.  Bono makes great music.  You go there.  He sings his songs.  It's fantastic.  The second he starts speaking up to world leaders, I get a little nauseous.  I don't want to hear it.  But he can go speak to world leaders, which is important. 
[01:23:00]  Because the world leaders want to be seen with Bono.  Not yet, but Bono goes in.  The second he falls out of favor, which for some reason...  Bono goes in and gives him like a fucking earful.  He doesn't go in.  It's not like a little love fest.  He goes...  Do you think anyone wants to take shit from Bono?  You think a world leader...  You think any president of any nation wants to take shit from Bono?  They want a photo with Bono.  Who doesn't?  But he gives him shit.  So you sit there and you take some shit and go,  all right, we'll write off the debt from Africa.  Like we were getting it anyway.  No, how about that picture?  How about Bono goes to Saudi Arabia and gets us fucking dollar gas? 
[01:23:30]  Let him pull that fucking...  Let him pull that off.  Go ahead.  You make a good point.  All right.  That's what people say when they don't have an answer.  All right.  I'm not taking it anymore.  I'm not going to count it.  I'm feeling tension between all our comedian friends and Anthony at this point.  Except for me.  I love Jay Moore.  You've got to be two-sided.  I'm one of the biggest advocates of Jay Moore.  That's to be said.  Yeah, Ed's always been a big supporter.  Even when Ope goes, Jay Moore was weird for a while? 
[01:24:00]  Stop.  I made good on that.  I know.  I made good on that.  How about all the people...  I'll be upset with people that didn't come on the show when we didn't have a show.  How about the people like after the first phone call I made on the message boards?  Yeah.  He's still got a fucking proof to me.  Yeah.  They weren't willing to accept it.  Like, I don't know.  He was only on for 45 minutes.  Yeah, sorry.  And there was an hour and 10 minutes left in the show.  Yeah, sorry that Jay gave us hundreds of hours of good radio.  Yeah, sorry I jerked off a gay man on live radio on N.E.W. for crying out loud. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, can you...  Remember all the shit we got away with?  I can't even imagine anymore being there.  Sorry, you bent over a black hooker.  And that's changed so much.  The stuff we did on regular radio.  A little white thunder.  Anyway, we've got to talk to this author before we get into what Jay Moore is up to.  You're going to enjoy this book.  This guy is terrific.  Sinfremis?  I did.  I was...  Yeah.  Thank you.  Problem? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, there could have been a huge problem.  We're setting up something.  Mm-hmm.  And the author was listening in.  Well, that's fine because the book is good.  It's called Sinful Nims, and I think the listeners will enjoy this book.  It has like...  So you just take an ordinary word.  Did I do something wrong?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Oh, okay.  You take an ordinary word.  Hey, Starfucker.  Could I get a black Starbucks?  And I'd like a medium, please.  See, like rags. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, give Jay Moore an example.  You take a word like rags.  Relishing a golden shower.  That's what that means.  And the whole book takes words...  Rap, R-A-P, repetitive anal penetration.  It's an entire book.  There goes Dickie Goodman.  Flash, fucking lazy ass shithead.  Where's Arlie Army? 
[01:26:00]  You guys played so much Full Metal Jacket last week that I bought it.  And it's a great...  Again.  Well, that doesn't love it.  Wow.  No shit.  The first half of the movie's great.  We don't care if you're niggers, kikes, bicks, or greasers.  I love how he mixes it.  Greasers.  Greasers.  Greasers at the end of kikes and niggers.  You're so ugly, you can be a modern art masterpiece.  You had best square your ass away and start shitting me Tiffany Kupflex.  Or I will definitely fuck you up. 
[01:26:30]  He was the best sergeant ever.  And in the second half of the movie, though, the old sergeant, to me, the old colonel, could  be the greatest character in movie history.  And Jimmy does the impression.  Not many impressions come out of Jimmy Orton.  That's right.  But this is Jimmy's impression of this guy.  Was that supposed to be some kind of sick joke?  I like your impression of the guy from Apocalypse Now.  What guy?  Ah, son.  What?  The colonel that's in the room, in the trailer with Harrison Ford. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, we'll pass both ways to save time.  That guy who was passing time.  Yeah, he was the greatest.  You better get your head and your ass wired together, or I will take a giant shit on you.  What a threat.  We'll take a giant shit on you.  If I find out there was an illegal killing, there will be a court-martial on your ass.  That's the real guy from Platoon.  There's always one real guy in the movie.  All right, let's get this author on the show here.  You will be molested.  His name is Stealing Clausey. 
[01:27:30]  Sorry.  No, yes, Stealing Clausey.  Stealing Clausey.  Can I hold the book in my hands?  Stealing.  Oh, yeah.  Hello.  Yes, sir.  How are you?  Is your name Stealing Clausey?  Yes.  Is that your real name?  Yeah.  Liar, whore, liar, whore, and you know it.  Yeah, I know.  That's my pen name, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What does it mean, though?  It doesn't mean anything.  No?  No.  Cool.  All right.  When did you first, because, like, my, my, I was wondering about the, uh... 
[01:28:00]  Oh, we're just getting coffee delivered to us.  Sorry, Stealing.  Yeah, no problem.  Someone just put down black coffee next to me.  Stealing, I like Cliff.  Tell us about Cliff.  Well, let Stealing at least explain what this book is all about, and then we'll get into some  of the examples.  Oh, okay.  Just to get everyone on the same page.  Go ahead, Stealing.  Well, years ago, when I worked for a computer company, we used to message each other and  email each other.  We knew that management could read it.  Right.  And, you know, you couldn't use profanity or whatever.  So one of my buddies came up with a good idea. 
[01:28:30]  Every day, he would say, you asshole.  And the first simple name was Yah.  Or we'd say, you fucking lazy ass shithead.  And that became Flash.  So just kind of...  Or you Flash, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, take a little bit of poetic license with him.  Well, there you go.  A lot of poetic license.  This one right here is pretty cool.  Wait, hold on.  Let me see what page...  This is page 101.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Yeah, it's...  Where's that?  Where's that?  It's the Q-Tips? 
[01:29:00]  Q-Tips.  Oh, Quota.  Quota, what's that one?  Of course, the use of toys anal.  Yeah, one...  I noticed there's a lot of...  The cartoon is...  Here's like a biker guy with a little beanie cap.  He's got a chicken.  Who did he do?  A dildo.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What page is that?  What page is that?  It's 100.  100.  For 101.  Yeah.  Who did these illustrations, Dilley?  Good friend of mine, Jason Love, out in California. 
[01:29:30]  Okay, now what is on page 100?  100 is like some biker guy.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me get it.  Let me get it.  All right.  Oh, I see it.  He's got a little beanie cap on.  There it is.  He's got a little beanie.  Jimmy's got it.  I thought one was a woman.  They're both little gay men.  No, it's supposed to be a babe.  Now, I don't know.  What made you think that company memos being passed around with these little things would  make a good book?  Well, what's that, Jimmy? 
[01:30:00]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Jimmy's got one.  He's been all morning just cracking up.  It's unbelievable how much he likes this book.  Hold on.  Page 30.  There's an actual, there's two, like, devils having sex.  And the guy's like, the one devil spanking the other devil.  And he's going, who's your devil?  Oh, this is good.  Or like, turn to page 28.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Turn to page 28.  Hold on.  Oh, 28.  Jimmy, I think you can find 28.  I don't have 28 now. 
[01:30:30]  I go, oh, my God.  It's a muscle bone chicken.  Ecstasy.  Engorged cock.  Satisfying that ass's sinful yen.  Wow.  And that's a long one.  Okay, well, here's...  You didn't read the caption.  Can you read the caption?  Oh, ecstasy.  Engorged cock.  Satisfying that ass's sinful yen.  No, but there's a chicken, there's a chicken having sex with the guy, and he's whack-whacking  his ass, and it says, cock-a-doodle-doo, who's your daddy? 
[01:31:00]  No, no, no.  God damn.  I like cunt.  Now, how did you come up with so many of these?  Just over the years, you know, shit that I've heard.  I've actually heard people say something, and them not realize that it was an acronym.  You're kidding.  He's got a talent.  He's got a special talent.  Yeah, that way people would know.  17.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's see if Jimmy likes 17.  It's one of his favorites.  Jimmy's a good gauge for this, because he's... 
[01:31:30]  Yep, yep.  He's getting the last.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  I'm on 21.  There's 17.  Okay.  Now, cunt.  Can't understand normal.  Wait, hold on.  What's the last part?  My page doesn't have it.  Can't understand normal what?  Thinking.  Thinking.  Right.  It's a picture of a chick reading a cookbook.  Wait, I can't read it anymore.  Upside down.  So, let me ask you a question, because a friend of mine and I were talking, and he was saying  that, like, when he hears an acronym, he'll kind of, like, think of other words that it 
[01:32:00]  might have meant originally.  So, when you first hear a word, do you automatically just start, like, connecting it with that line  of, like...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know, like, when I first wrote to you guys, when I first saw your name, I was like,  oh, man, these dudes are young.  They got all the pussy in New York.  And I thought of Opie.  I was like, oh, Opie's penis is enormous.  You know?  Then I thought of Anthony.  Now, Anthony's a perfect New York name.  You know, even Tony.  Like, Tony owns New York. 
[01:32:30]  Ooh.  Or Anthony.  Anthony nails the hotties of New York.  Wait, hold on.  Anthony nails...  The hotties of New York.  The hotties.  What about the O?  Of.  Hotties.  Oh, of.  Oh, of, yeah.  Now, how...  What would you call an anachronism that involves the name in the explanation?  Yes.  Good point, Jay.  Good point.  Because Anthony's an obese.  Because...  I call it a fucking simple name.  Wow. 
[01:33:00]  I tell you, the bush on this chick on page 129, Vampish.  Oh, yeah, right?  Tell our listeners what...  Oh, she got a pierced tit and that nice fucking pussy.  Yeah.  Oh, Vampish is a picture of this really hot babe.  And Vampish stands for voluptuous ass, magnificent pussy, and incredible sultry hooters.  And the cartoon, there's two photographers, she's walking down, like, a beauty contest.  And one photographer says to the other, do you think her tits are real? 
[01:33:30]  And he says, the other one says, of course not, we're cartoons.  You know, so they have a whole book, it's like that.  And I noticed that you guys are busting my balls about my college buddy, James Oscar Barrows.  I'm busting your balls.  That's what we do.  I love it, I love it.  Are we busting his balls about?  Wait, wait, why are we busting his balls?  I don't even remember what we said.  Yeah, you're like, yeah, who is that?  For what publication?  Oh, no, well, every book has, like, a quote from somebody, and you're saying it's somebody  that is somebody, but it's just a name. 
[01:34:00]  Because before I got to you guys, before the book went to print, I'm like, okay, I gotta  have a review.  So James is like, I'll give you one.  I'm like, fuck it.  Ah, and there's where the review came from.  Oh, yeah.  Well, why didn't you get a real review of that book?  Well, I was trying to, you know what, because of the content of the book, a lot of people  were snubbing me.  They were saying, oh, it's pornographic.  As a matter of fact, the first print, the second printing will actually change to the cartoon. 
[01:34:30]  Uh-huh, yeah.  Because Yahoo, which is one of my favorites, which shows a girl jerking his guy up, the captain  says, do you Yahoo?  And Yahoo stands for Yanker Hard on Auto.  Ah, see?  On page 143, now you see she's got a hold of his cock.  And because of that, they're saying that the book is pornographic.  Oh, boy.  So the cartoonist is redoing it where you won't actually see his cock, but just don't see  the load going over his shoulder.  Kind of makes it easy. 
[01:35:00]  Well, I will say one thing, stealing.  I look at these photos, like on page, what is this, 87?  Let me see.  87.  87.  And there's a picture of like a black guy banging his white guy's wife.  There's a double penetration going on.  Oh, oatmeal.  Yeah, oatmeal.  What does oatmeal mean?  Oh, you don't even want to know.  What's oatmeal mean, Opa?  Oatmeal says, obstinate anal thrusting may evoke anal leakage.  And the guy...  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my goodness.  And the guy talking her in her back says, hopefully...  That's terrific.  That's terrific. 
[01:35:30]  Hey, stealing, I got to tell you, we've been reading these all morning long, and now the  listeners are going crazy.  They're calling up.  The phones are just alight.  I love it.  And they want to talk to you about some of the stuff in the book, okay?  Sure.  Uh, the first call is, uh, some guy, Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve!  Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve, how you doing?  Hello, how are you?  Very good.  Hi, am I actually on the phone with stealing?  Yes.  Yes, Steve.  Hi, stealing, how are you?  I've actually been...  A friend of mine works for the station.  I have a copy of the book, and I'm kind of enjoying it. 
[01:36:00]  I just wanted to know, where do you get your ideas?  Because I'm really enjoying them.  Uh, believe it or not, they come from all over.  I do believe it.  Uh, you know what, once I got into the habit of...  Ramone!  Stealing Closy should die of AIDS!  Well, what are my favorite...  Ramone!  This book has the humor value of AIDS!  Ramone!  Today should be stealing Closy Day!  Ramone! 
[01:36:30]  Acronym Suck Nigger Dicks!  Well, let's, uh...  Well, that was...  Ramone!  This book should be in Robert Reed's robe pocket!  Ramone!  All right, can we hang up on us?  Yeah, man.  You know, a company should have anthrax blown through the vents.  A Marvel book!  RamoneVinson.com 
[01:37:00]  You know, uh, stealing, I gotta apologize.  Uh, our phone screener, uh, seems to be a little off today.  Yeah.  Because, uh, Steve from Yellowstone, for some reason, uh, was not, uh, not supposed to get through.  He does that to a few of our guests sometimes, but, uh, we do have, uh, other callers that have called up.  Yeah, you want, let's say hi to Cigars and Scotch.  He's a faithful listener of the program.  CigarsandScoch!  CigarsandScoch.  CigarsandScoch.com!  That's right.  I have one for you.  All right.  Hey, Lord. 
[01:37:30]  Get eight, you lousy, obese, retarded douche.  And if I had your book in front of me, here's exactly what I would do with it.  He's pouring himself some champagne?  What is he doing?  He's toasting the book.  Watering, uh, flowers?  Could be.  I think he just woke up.  This could be a long one.  Let's see if...  Wait, wait. 
[01:38:00]  Now, would he use it as a urethra and pee through it?  I don't know what he would do.  I didn't get it.  Really?  I didn't get it either.  Yeah, Stealing, uh, like I said, we've been just, uh, laughing our asses off over there.  Yeah, without a doubt.  I really do.  Uh, there's a guy named North on the Instant Feedback from San Diego.  North by Northwest.  He says, uh, he's got one for you there, Stealing. 
[01:38:30]  It's, uh, it's Shaft.  Shaft.  Shaft.  Yeah.  Hold on, let's see if Stealing has one first.  Yeah, do you have one for Shaft?  No, you know, it's too fucking early in the morning to come up with something.  Oh, I thought you wrote a book about it.  Well, I got crap, but you can't remember a fucking thing.  Yeah, but that's not Shaft, though.  Well, uh...  The point I'm at right now.  That's not Shaft.  That's not even the same letters.  You might want to add this one to your next book, Shaft.  Stealing has a furry taint.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right. 
[01:39:00]  Let's go back to the phones.  Uh, who's this?  This is, uh, Hilley in Atlanta.  Who?  Kelly, H-R-L-Y.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, what's happening?  Uh, where's Jay Moore?  Where?  Jay, got a question for you.  Hold on, we're talking to an author right now.  What do you got for Jay Moore?  Oh, sorry, dude.  Um, I wonder where did Willis College Standing go?  What the fuck?  All right, we'll get into all that in a second or two.  We're finishing up with this author that has a great book out right now. 
[01:39:30]  I'm sorry.  I just tuned in.  All right, call us back in a few minutes.  Sorry about that stealing.  It's coming back Tuesday.  It's going to be on Tuesday.  Opie pounds it every day.  Fuck you, man.  Don't fucking tell me my shit.  Fucking call up.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't fucking make one about my fucking name, buddy.  It's a compliment, dude.  That's a fucking compliment?  Make one about fucking Anthony.  Don't make fun of me just because my name's fucking Opie, you fuck.  I love Opie.  Yeah, but...  You love me so much, you got to make fun of my fucking name, you shit fucker? 
[01:40:00]  No, I said Opie's penis is enormous.  That's a fucking compliment.  All right, yeah.  Why are you going to fucking curse so much anyway, you fucking faggot?  Because I like to fucking curse.  Listen, listen.  Too early in the fucking morning.  This is my fucking job.  Listen, I'm up here trying to promote your book.  You got some fucking douchebag quote at the back.  James Oscar Barrows.  Stealing isn't your real name.  Listen, Stealing, this is Jay Moore.  Opie's a little sensitive because if you know anything about this show, he had testicular  cancer and he lost a ball. 
[01:40:30]  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  So he's a little, you know, he gets a little uptight when you bring up anything about his  dick.  Yeah, like John Starks?  Mike Lowell?  Tom Green, Lance Armstrong, couple fucking heroes.  I love those guys.  Yeah, you love them so much.  Do a joke about them.  Hey, look, if someone told me that my penis is enormous, that's a compliment, Opie.  Don't be so sensitive.  My penis is enormous because I got half a fucking sack.  Oh, well, hey, don't bitch about it.  At least you got one.  That's fucking great, dude. 
[01:41:00]  You know what?  You're right.  Whenever I get out of the shower, I go, hey, the bag is half full.  All right, let's...  That's funny to you.  Let's...  Hey, look, I really do...  Oh, and now you got to get off the phone?  We tell you when you're fucking done.  We fucking tell you when you're done.  What do you got to go do next?  I'm not getting off the phone.  I wanted to show you one in the book.  Show me one?  I'm on the radio.  You have one about Opie's one ball?  Well, that's real funny, Jay.  Actually, I have to think about that one. 
[01:41:30]  Hey, let's go back to the phones and say hi to Ben in Boston.  Ben?  Hey, what's wrong with this?  It's Jay Moore.  Ben from Boston.  No, why are you giving this guy shit?  This guy's hilarious, Jay.  He's finer than you are.  My shirt's too tight.  Blah!  I saw him in the dryer.  I threw a Coke with Tom Brady.  I saw him in the dryer.  My shirt was wet.  Blah!  Hey, uh...  I like stealing.  This book is really good.  Yeah, Ben, you like the book?  Yeah, I love the book.  It's hilarious.  Why is Jay bothering this guy?  He's great.  You got any questions for stealing? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, are you going to write, like, a movie, a book?  What?  Are you going to write, like, a book or a movie, another one?  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You actually have the one book, or is there more than one?  No, it's just the one.  Ramone!  I should put on a fireman's hat and rape his publisher.  Ramone!  He should do book signings with Arthur Ashe's prick finger.  Ramone!  Ramone!  This book belongs on Gary Glitter's laptop! 
[01:42:30]  Ramone!  Acronyms are for fellows against Gary Glitter over there!  That's a maggot, you unfunny bag of shite!  I think that was Steve from Yellowstone again.  I think he got through the screener.  That was, no, that was Ben from Boston.  Ben from Boston, yeah. 
[01:43:00]  I can tell from that, blah, blah, blah.  Because he's up all night.  Holy Jesus.  Oh, what an awful, awful book.  What an awful idea for a book.  Oh, there he is.  Jimmy, you missed a couple of funny phone calls.  Steve from Yellowstone called again, and Ben from Boston.  Very funny when they call in, and you're never here.  Where's the guy?  Oh, you hung up. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Ramone!  I felt it's AIDS day, and I've got to keep the theme.  That's AIDS day!  We should be signed with Arthur Ashe's prick finger.  Oh, you're a horrible human being.  That guy sounded like he was from, like, Franklin, New Jersey, and shot deer or something.  Yeah.  Where was he from?  Just forget it happened.  California.  Just forget it happened.  Just forget it happened.  Just get it out of our minds.  Oh, it hurts my throat. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, that's my name, Stealing Clossy.  And it doesn't even mean anything.  It's like fucking, there's his porno name, Pat Mine.  Who was the James guy in the back?  Huh?  Who was the guy in the back?  Did you guys ask him something?  A college roommate or something?  Yeah.  There's nobody.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Jay Moore's in studio.  It's AIDS day, so we've got a little sing-along for everybody.  So that's why I'm here.  That's why I'm here.  Ah, everyone laugh at Hawk.  What are you doing?  He missed his cue.  No mouse using faggot.  Everyone has AIDS. 
[01:44:30]  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  And so this is the end of our story.  And everyone is dead from AIDS.  It took from me my best friend, my only true pal, my only bright star.  Well, I'm going to march on Washington. 
[01:45:00]  Lead the fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us.  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  My father, AIDS.  My sister, AIDS.  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend.  The gaze and the traits and the whites and the spades.  Everyone has AIDS.  My grandma and my dog are all blue.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  The Pope has got it and so do you.  Come on, everybody.  We've got quilting to do.  We're going to break down these barricades. 
[01:45:30]  Everyone has AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus.  I'll tell you, I've had, like, horrible potty training.  I had one with my daughter.  My daughter, my first daughter, my daughter's, like, 21 now.  When she was young, I guess how old are you when you're potty training?  You're almost two years old.  Depends on the chromosomes.  Right. 
[01:46:00]  But my wife was really into the potty training, you know, and read all the books.  And you have to, you know, after she pees or shits in the potty, you know, we all have to applaud.  And everybody who's around, it's a big deal.  She's just about potty training.  And my wife says, I was going out one day.  And she says, you take her, you take her with you.  So I have this baby in the car seat.  And she's just a little girl, a little baby.  And we're out someplace.  And she says to me, Dad, I have to go potty.  And, you know, my heart, I get heart complications.  I'm thinking, I can't go in a public restroom. 
[01:46:30]  I can't sit her down.  And where am I going to take her?  I can't go in the men's room.  And I don't want her to sit down.  I mean, I can't go in the ladies' room.  I don't want her to sit down in the men's room.  So I said, honey, you know, can you hold it?  Is there any way to hold it?  And she goes, is it a little baby?  You know, the baby.  Yes, yes.  She goes, I'll try, Daddy, because she could see the horror in my eyes.  She goes, I'll try, I'll try, Daddy.  So I put her in the car, and I put her in the car seat.  And we're driving down the Ventura Freeway.  I live in Los Angeles.  We're driving down the Ventura Freeway.  And she goes, in the back seat, I hear, Daddy, I can't hold that. 
[01:47:00]  I go, okay, honey, we'll pull off here, we'll pull off here, and we'll go to the gas station.  She goes, no, I can't.  I go, okay, okay, fine.  So we pull over to the side of the Ventura Freeway, this public freeway.  And I pull up, and there's, like, hedges on the side of the freeway there.  So I get her out, I unbuckle her from the car seat, and I put her in my arm, and I go over to the hedges, and I take one step over to the hedges, and I don't realize it's a gully.  It's a ravine.  Oh, my God.  So I step, and I slip on my back, I fall on my back, and I start hurtling down this mountain, down this side of the Ventura Freeway. 
[01:47:30]  And I'm holding the baby, I'm coddling her on my side, she's screaming, I'm yelling, the twigs are breaking, there's mud, my pants rip, it cuts my ass.  And I end up at the bottom of this gully in this horrible, like, infested kind of wet puddle, and I'm bleeding, and I'm in this gully, and I'm holding the baby, and she's crying, and I kind of stand up, and I hold her in front of me, and she goes, I gotta go, I gotta pee.  I go, okay, all right, and I look, my wife had put her in some sort of, like, a jumpsuit kind of thing. 
[01:48:00]  So I unbuckle the thing, and I pull it down around her ankles, and I'm holding her up by the armpits in front of me, and I go, okay, honey, go, go.  And she goes, I can't, I'm gonna pee on my pants, I'm gonna pee because her legs are down below.  And this is the first daughter, I've never really, you know, I grew up with brothers and everything.  I said, okay, all right, put your, just put your feet up on my shoulders, up on my neck, hold, I'm holding her in front of me, like, face to face.  Put your feet up on my neck, and then I figure, you know, your legs are out toward me, and then you'll pee down into this, uh... 
[01:48:30]  If I saw this, you'd be shot, by the way.  Right, so her feet are up on my neck, and I go, okay, go.  Well, I didn't know that, it seems like, with the vagina, that the, whatever way your feet are aiming, is what way the, uh, the fluid goes.  So she goes, and then all of a sudden it's, in my face, she's pissing, in my face, my fucking mouth, in my mouth, I'm screaming like a woman, like, my ass is bleeding, I'm standing in a puddle of, of, this is for a guy who didn't want to go into a public bathroom. 
[01:49:00]  That's right.  And I, and I start to scream, and she's screaming, and it's all over her clothes, and she goes, I got it on my clothes, my, her fucking clothes, it's in my fucking mouth.  So I'm trying to be a good dad, and I take off her, the bottom of her pants, and now she's naked, and my hands are covered in the mud, in the, in the blood, so now it's all over her, and I'm filled with piss, she's filled with piss, and I try to climb the hill.  Now I'm climbing the hill, and it's mud, you know, and every, I get up, like, five, five steps, and then I slide back down the hill, and she's crying, and I'm almost crying, and, and I can't breathe, and, you know, my heart, I think I'm going to have a heart attack. 
[01:49:30]  Like, finally, after, it seems like an eternity, I get up on top, on the freeway, and I come through the hedges, like 500 feet from where my car is, and I'm standing there, and I'm bleeding, and I'm covered in mud, and she's crying, and there's piss, and there's blood, and, and a car slows down, and then I got a naked little girl out of the hedges, and that car slows down, and pulls down his window, and goes, are you, are you Howie Mandel?  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program in studio, Jay Moore. 
[01:50:00]  What the hell happened?  What happened to the music?  I was feeling the flow of that song.  Who shut that off?  Hawk?  Nah, something happened with the computer.  No, I love getting, no, Hawk wasn't near any piece of machinery, and I said his name like that, and he put his hands up in the air like, couldn't have been me.  There it is.  Dillette crashed. 
[01:50:30]  I was kind of feeling it, man.  Dillette crashed.  Jay, what are you doing in New York, by the way?  We don't have to plug anything, right?  No.  You never come here to plug, we understand that.  I killed Michael Irvin on my SI.com article today.  Oh, yeah?  Home of lying fucking, you know what?  Yeah, he got caught again.  Yeah, and his answers are no good.  I was looking at your wall of fame over there with the hot broads.  Yeah.  And that girl, the charisma carpenter.  What?  Charisma.  The one from Buffy. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, I'd pee in her ass.  And then we saw Britney Spears.  Pre-pregnant Britney.  Commenting what a fucking wreck she is, and she's married to that nigger.  Jesus.  Kevin Federline.  Cornrows his hair for the cover of People like he's fucking Bronson Arroyo.  Dude, the guy is great, though, man.  Have you heard his music?  Jake, you're knocking him without hearing the music.  Shut up.  He's good, man.  He's going to be the next Eminem.  Shut up.  You have any Ken Federline?  I mean, Jake knocked the guy, but he's good.  I like him.  Ken Federline? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, what's his name?  Kevin.  I like when Jimmy takes the pop culture test.  Yeah, it's a club show to Kevin.  I was reading in page six that Scott Stapp, former frontman from Creed, showed up drunk  to celebrity poker.  I hear he's a complete asshole, by the way.  I'm in town doing the NASCAR Awards.  I host the NASCAR Awards every year.  Yeah.  I don't know what network it's on or what time.  Probably Spike, I mentioned.  And what is it, Charlie?  TNT.  TNT?  TNT, all right.  And Scott Stapp performed last year, and they go, please welcome the former lead singer. 
[01:52:00]  First of all, he did fucking Creed songs with him and his little solo band.  Yeah.  And we're backstage, and all night, Charlie produces the show, I'm backstage at fucking  NASCAR going, hey, hey, hey, mocking the guy.  And I swear to God, we're backstage, and there's a fucking piano backstage, and I go, hey, man,  what's up?  And he goes, what's going on?  And I go, oh, I thought you'd be wearing leather pants, like, just fucking around.  And he goes, I was going to, but they're a little too tight these days. 
[01:52:30]  Two seconds later.  Her hair.  Her hair.  That's how he's warming up.  Her hair.  Her.  Her.  Jimmy, you're looking at me like I'm talking about putting my dick in your water.  He doesn't know.  Jimmy doesn't know about anything.  How the fuck can you argue Leonard Skinner in Black Sabbath, you fucking dope, Opie?  Jimmy, Leonard Skinner over Black Sabbath. 
[01:53:00]  You're fucking stupid.  Southern rock, baby.  You're a dumb person.  Southern rock.  Jimmy's little smirk, how adorable he just was.  I like that.  I like the spunk.  You can't argue Leonard Skinner over Black Sabbath at all.  Why?  Black Sabbath over Leonard Skinner.  It's two different things.  It's fucking rock and roll.  It's fucking Sabbath.  It's two different.  Those are two different.  Leonard Skinner stinks.  Those are two different crowds.  But, you know, those are things you put your lighter up to if you're an incest survivor.  Enough of Leonard Skinner already.  You can get it, Freebird.  Eight minutes.  Go take a shit when you play that, DJs. 
[01:53:30]  No, it's a little longer if you play the live version.  You can really get it.  Forget about it.  14 minutes, I believe.  Am I Losing is one of their best songs, by the way, which got no play.  That's just between us.  I'm trying to play something.  All right.  We got the Kevin Federline song.  Dude, the guy's great.  I mean, you can use it if you want to.  Ken Federline.  Kevin, I mean.  Ken.  Ken, yeah.  I get nervous.  I don't know.  You want to listen in?  Yeah, he's good, man.  A little taste.  You guys good.  I should be saying, keep my damn name out your mouth.  But y'all people keep increasing my change, man. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead and say what you want to.  I'm going to sell back to me or a bull, then I'm a goner.  Yeah.  I know y'all wish you was in my position.  Because I keep getting in situations that you wish you wasn't.  Cousin.  I'm not your brother, not your uncle.  I'm daddy, dude.  Stepping in.  Hold the head up.  I'll be here.  You're going to hit me on the head with the show.  Hey, where are the white women at? 
[01:54:30]  Add in your magazine, how are you taking a week back in the game?  All right.  All right.  All right.  Turn it off.  Horrible.  All right.  Turn it off.  Well, hold on.  All right.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  God, that was good.  What's wrong with you guys?  I got it from a Negro.  Yes, you did.  That guy, a lot of people would say he sounds like Eminem, but I think he's got his own distinct  sound.  I like his style a lot.  There's a line in there where he says that the paparazzi's following him. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, sure.  No, they're following your wife.  Anthony, where is everybody?  We're going to get laid.  Yeah.  And gnarly, I need to hear.  Gnarly's my fucking makes me crash almost.  I laugh so hard.  No, they're on two different banks.  Hey, let's say hi to Oscar in Indiana.  Oscar.  Is it neither?  Hello?  What's up?  Hey, everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Oscar?  Oscar?  Gee.  Yeah.  Oh, hell.  Gee.  What the hell was that? 
[01:55:30]  What was that?  The fart contest is getting dreadfully close to me.  No, I don't want to smell you, Mike.  Smell his mic.  No, I certainly won't.  It's a celebrity.  Smell his mic.  I don't care who it is.  I will not smell his mic.  Smell his fart, Mike.  No, the whole fucking area stinks.  I just dropped one, too.  I'm just dropping it on your dick.  No.  Sorry, Oscar.  Oscar, go ahead.  We're losing control of the show.  That really reeks.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Can I get a pampered towel or something, Gray Wolf?  Oh, God.  Or some spray?  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, the guy's singing his lungs out, and Anthony needs paper towels and luck salt.  Oh, God.  Oh, what do you want?  Oh, my God.  It hit me.  Jesus Christ.  Don't forget, Jimmy did it, too.  It was a combination.  I was looking at two men.  I got to tell you.  Get away from me with that spray.  Hey, everybody.  We're going to get laid.  Dude, I got to tell you, Jimmy's never smell.  Thank you.  Very rarely they smell.  That's you, bro.  All right, Oscar.  Will you get gnarly for me?  I like that challenge.  Hold on.  Oscar's got something for the show. 
[01:56:30]  Oscar.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Oscar.  I'm kind of confused.  I don't really.  I'm just trying to find a responsible individual for messing up my bathrooms and showers.  What are you talking about?  Well, I'm a porter at a truck stop.  You know what a porter is?  Yes.  Porter House.  Yes, someone that did horribly in high school.  Oh, well, it's also a person that, like, cleans restrooms, sweeps mops. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, no.  Hey, and he used it perfectly, James.  There you go.  So, Oscar, what's the problem?  What's the matter?  I love that all the time in my life.  Oscar, what's your job title?  I'm a porter.  All right, so what's the matter?  What the hell is a porter?  One step above slaves.  What's the matter?  All right, well, I got the cell number.  What's the matter, shit cleaner?  I called the cell number this morning because I keep having to scrub it off. 
[01:57:30]  Let me ask you a question, honestly.  It's about what you're talking about.  Do you ever get, like, a fleck of shit that's stuck in the side of the bowl you've got to  use your fingernail to scrape off?  Oh, no.  Well, I won't get into that.  There's a lot of stuff I've got to do, but.  All right.  What's the problem, shit cleaner?  All right, here.  Let's use that one.  Oscar.  Oscar.  So your job is to clean out the toilets of some rest area in India.  Cut to the manhole, Oscar.  How many rest areas do you have to do? 
[01:58:00]  It's not a rest area.  It's a truck stop.  Is it like a mafia thing where you fight for routes?  I was laughing at your finger and just going towards him.  Jesus, Jay.  So what are you saying, buddy?  I don't understand this.  You guys are, this is weird.  I ain't never heard of, is this, I don't know.  Do you have urinal cakes in your pocket, Oscar?  Oscar.  You have a shitty job and you're not happy that you have to clean up Opie and Anthony advertisements 
[01:58:30]  on your toilets.  I don't mind my cleaning duties is, you know, there's bathroom graffiti and there's boogers  on the walls, but this Sharpie writing that covers like two square feet.  Yeah.  Oscar, I think you're full of shit and I just think you're some fucking moron from Nutley  doing a little gag.  Wait, Jay's calling shenanigans.  Hey bud, what's your problem?  Ramones, get me a mic, bye.  All right.  Learning about Cuba, having some food.  Having some food.  Thank you, Oscar.  Our time, Mr. Hand. 
[01:59:00]  Hey, uh, real history, see the globe right over there.  I know that, dude.  I like when you do the ticket scouper guy, because I don't know a single line of dialogue  except for when you do it.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  It's the moan.  Hey, Debbie.  Isn't this great?  Charlie.  Who's Charlie?  Charlie's just some dude, man.  Hi, Charlie.  What's up, Charlie?  Well, go and get one of those abortions.  Can I hear an early one more time? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, no.  That's your Academy Award winner, dude.  I love that one.  That's fucking insane.  That's 10.  Well, I smoked way too much.  Oh, those guys are fags.  You know what it is?  It's the little, like, screamy in his voice.  Like, I'm kind of half-screwing.  Yeah.  Oh, those guys are fags.  That's the very end.  That's fags.  You can't, like, say it in your house without just sounding like a dick doing Spicoli.  It sucks that he doesn't want to acknowledge that role, because it's the greatest role ever. 
[02:00:00]  He hates to acknowledge that.  He really is a self-important ass, isn't he?  No, he's not.  Yes, he is.  Fuck you.  All right.  Is that your little brother?  He's a good-looking kid.  Good-looking kid.  Two tickets for Earth, Wind, and Fire and little brother.  I love that.  Listen, listen.  Let's try to get this on track again.  We've got Jeffrey Ross outside the studio.  We're going to bring him in a second.  Yes.  Like a little Walter Matthau.  Sorry, man. 
[02:00:30]  It's a good one, though, Jeff.  All right, listen.  And Rob Bartlett, who's doing the Brian Wilson character for I Miss on MSNBC.  It's going to be like last year when you fell in love with that girl at the photomat.  You bought 40 rolls of fucking film.  You don't even own a camera.  Five different things going on at this point.  This is what we in the book publishing business like to call gay.  Really?  Really gay.  I didn't even have a...  That isn't even labeled.  Wow.  That's gnarly.  Gnarly's over there. 
[02:01:00]  Go ahead.  Hit gnarly.  I'm hitting the ones without any keys or sign.  Oh, gnarly!  All right, listen.  I want that in my machine, too, and I guess.  You're not getting machines.  You're not getting a machine.  You're not mature enough.  Look at Kelly Ripa with her fucking ripped-up tummy.  You know her labias are extra long these days.  Do you ever see her camel toe?  I saw a photo, which is fucking really nice, man.  It's on Wackbag.  It's on many SIG pictures.  So many kids have come out of there.  It's got to be a little loose.  Big fist in there.  She's smuggling a fist in those little underpants.  Love it.  The size of that fist.  What's the family she's got? 
[02:01:30]  What, is she up to three kids now?  Three?  Can we play the Rob Bartlett?  Three on one side.  Please?  What?  Please?  Yes.  Brian Wilson character that Rob Bartlett does on IMSS show on MSNBC.  Once again this morning, he's wearing the Opie and Anthony t-shirt, spread the virus,  and he had this to say.  My friend Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys.  Good morning, Brian.  Good morning, Opie.  Good morning, Anthony.  Brian.  Who wears little Jimmy and E-Rock and Martini Steve's. 
[02:02:00]  He's just doing inside jokes on IMSS show.  What's your Senators watching?  What?  Yeah.  IMSS listeners have no idea.  I'm on this show, and I have no idea what they're talking about today.  I don't understand a single word IMSS says.  I love IMSS.  I like IMSS a lot.  I don't get it, dude.  I don't dislike him.  I just, he surrounded himself with some great talent.  All right, and then Brian Wilson had this to say.  Well, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Peaceful Kwanzaa, Solemn Ramadan, and for all you atheists, 
[02:02:30]  I guess, have a nice life, because that's about all you guys got.  I appreciate you, Opie.  Have a cookie.  11 minutes up the hour here on the episode.  11 minutes up the hour.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  I appreciate you, too.  What is he doing?  I love it.  All right, well, giving more plugs on MSNBC this morning. 
[02:03:00]  Thank you, Mr. Bartlett.  Thank you, Mr. IMSS, as well, for allowing that.  How come Charles McCoy doesn't help us out?  That really bothers me.  The other day, he said he loves this program.  Does he?  Yeah, he said that.  I was a little hurt by that.  The other day.  Where's Jeffrey Ross?  Let's see what he's up to, as well.  Jeffrey?  So, Jay's doing the NASCAR thing.  Will you pull up SI.com so I can see if it's on or not?  Jay, can we hang out sometimes?  No.  Hey, Jeffrey.  I want it.  I got to call Ben for your phone number.  I'll give you my number.  Ne-ne-ne-ne-ne.  Hi, Jeff.  Shut up, you hook-nosed Jew.  There he is. 
[02:03:30]  Whoa.  Wow.  Is he packing heat this time?  Not this time.  I don't know.  I figure you're over in Iraq so much.  Huh?  You should be carrying around an M-16.  I have a verbal assault unit.  Oh, they're hugging.  Jay Moore and Jeffrey Roll-Royce.  A couple of men.  Haven't seen each other in a while.  They're back slapping.  They're hugging and looking at each other.  Remember the time we double-teamed Georgina?  I think about it all the time.  Me and Jeff Roll-Royce double-teamed a chick in my apartment, and she was sucking his dick,  and I was fucking her from behind. 
[02:04:00]  Is she a comedian?  No, she's a waitress.  And then I made eye contact, so I gave her the finger behind her head, and he started laughing.  And she goes, what are you laughing at?  He goes, nothing.  I just thought of something.  I was like this.  I was fucking this.  And I go, and he's like this.  She goes, I just thought of something.  What's Jeff packing?  Jeff's got a nice fat hog on it.  Does he really?  Yeah, I'd say seven inches.  Like, same length as mine, but a little fatter.  I knew he had to have something good.  That's not what Georgina said, by the way, just for the record. 
[02:04:30]  She said that I had a bigger one.  And if my girlfriend's listening, this is all made up.  I just said, when's her 16th birthday?  Coming up.  I didn't know you had a big fat hog.  Good to see everybody.  Good to see you.  Yes.  My dick looks a lot...  It's really, really small when it's soft and sort of okay.  It's a grower, not a shower.  We all learned that.  Jeff had a...  I think we were relatively lengthwise, maybe.  I didn't take as good a look as you did, apparently.  I took a good...  Well, you were getting a head.  I was inside her giant Australian bush. 
[02:05:00]  Remember that fucking mange?  Remember when we said it was Kate Moss?  How long ago was this?  A long time ago.  Yesterday.  That was like September.  It's just blowing up your spot.  This is great.  A little Jersey reunion.  Norton Moore and Ross.  There you go.  That's right.  All you guys.  Show your stripper friend.  He's doing good.  He's a fireman in Irvington.  Badlands license plate still?  Yep.  What's that about?  Had a baby.  He's doing good. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  A little inside stuff.  Yeah, that's always good when you're doing a national talk show.  P-O-N-A.  Hey.  O-N-A-A-D.  Pete in New Jersey.  Pete.  Hey, Jay.  You going to be funny on Friday for the award this year?  Because you weren't really that funny last year.  Jesus.  I was all right.  I think Jay does a good job at that.  Take it easy, Pete.  Yeah, Pete.  Well, you know, they're pretty good, but, you know...  How would you have done, Pete, with NASCAR sponsors breathing down your neck and you're  not allowed to mention hillbillies or anything?  Well, you've just got to make fun of Jeff Gordon. 
[02:06:00]  He's too short.  Mark Martin, all those guys.  You know.  Wow.  That would fucking...  Wow.  Goddamn, he is short.  Give me one.  He is short.  Yeah, dude.  I can't fucking...  Fucking Jeff Gordon short, fuckers.  What's going on?  How's it going?  Shut up, you fucking faggot.  Go fuck your mother's cunt.  You dick.  Jeff Gordon short.  Fucking what's up, fuckers?  Hey, turn down your radio, Pete. 
[02:06:30]  He's not listening to your son, Pete.  He wants to listen to himself be insulted.  Yeah, I'm going to listen to him.  He called me douchebag.  Hey, Pete, give Jay some more material for his NASCAR gig.  Yeah, what else should I do?  Turn down your fucking radio, asshole.  This ain't Mike and the Mad Dog.  We'll be back on the flash after this.  You're just a lot of the flash.  Pete.  Turn down your radio, Pete.  It is down.  You can hear it on the replay.  Turn your fucking radio on.  Oh, no, no, no.  That's not that radio.  It's a different radio.  Oh, it's a different one.  Turn it off.  I live in a land of many radios.  You're a liar, Pete.  That's not the one we were telling you to turn down. 
[02:07:00]  It was the other one.  Welcome to Pete's radio land.  All right, give Jay more NASCAR material.  Come on, you got the short guy.  You got the short guy.  What's another funny NASCAR joke?  Last year I said, Kyle Busch looked like Peyton Manning.  You just fucking laughed, and then you just said I wasn't funny.  That's true, Pete.  You said I wasn't funny, and now you just laughed at a joke a year later.  Come on.  You got anything about a pit crew fire or something?  Yeah, Pete, come on. 
[02:07:30]  More material for Jay.  Go.  You know NASCAR.  Let's go.  What do you got?  I don't know.  I'm not a comedian.  I'm not a comedian.  Ah.  Just a critic.  There it is.  He's not a comedian.  Neither is Jay.  It hasn't held him back all this time.  Let's go to Ryan in North Carolina.  Now we got the calls coming in for Jay.  Ryan.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  I work for NASCAR, actually.  I want to know if Jay's going to address the Kurt Busch drunk driving incident in Phoenix.  No way.  It's not stupid. 
[02:08:00]  I think it's kind of funny.  Yeah, it's hilarious.  Hilarious.  What happened to keep a job?  We don't know much about NASCAR, Jay.  You got arrested for a DUI.  Well, he refused to breathaly.  Which is the same as being guilty of a DUI.  That's what you got to do, though.  You got to refuse.  You're going to get hauled in anyway.  Then you lose your license for a certain time.  Not when you're on that track, motherfucker.  You should see the fucking chicks you guys troll in with.  Oh my gosh, you're so hot.  Really?  That's all I got, boys.  NASCAR chicks are hot? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Really?  Dude, the guy gets handed a $5 million check on stage.  That's not including his yearly salary or any sponsor exemption or anything.  It's like, hey, you took fifth place.  Here's your $3.5 million check.  Bye.  Jesus.  They got to walk around with an advertisement with those ridiculous uniforms that say Exxon.  Why are you so negative, Jeff?  Jeff, that is true.  Negative.  Fucking.  I'm trying to weasel my way into the company.  Poker players are handed that shit and they don't have, like, hot groupies. 
[02:09:00]  It's because of degenerate gamblers.  Except for Andy Duke.  See the rack on her?  I don't think that she had those on the wrist of their lives.  Girls like guys with daughters.  I think she put those in.  I think she had them lowered.  What's wrong with advertisements?  That kind of money?  I don't walk around with a serious dog in my face.  Fucking $5 million.  Let's go to Eric in Fort Lee, New Jersey.  Eric.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Jeff Ross is at Caroline's.  Jay, I saw your girlfriend on Monday, you know, on that show. 
[02:09:30]  Wanted to put my cock between her tits.  She's so good looking.  Oh, this is a nice compliment.  It certainly is.  What a good guy.  Isn't that a nice...  Are those real?  Jesus Christ, fella.  Eric.  Come on.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Trucker Mike.  Trucker Mike, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, I just wanted to tell you, Truckin' Bozo was giving you guys props on the show yesterday.  Basically saying how much of a note talent that Howard is and that you guys would blow him away. 
[02:10:00]  Might make a good guess for you one in the morning.  The Truckin' Bozo.  Yeah, we should get him on the old horn.  That's a big show, right?  I don't know what he does.  I think I listened to him once.  He talks about, like, gas prices and stuff, I think.  Yeah, he's on the Truckin' channel.  He's on 171.  I'm serious.  He has a nice plug for the show there, Ope.  Yeah, I know.  I think he tells you where the cheap gas is around America.  I don't know.  What time is he on?  He's on, I believe, from 3 to 6.  Okay.  And I think he's organizing some kind of convoy in the near future. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, yeah.  There's a bunch of...  God, there's a convoy.  It might be entertaining for you.  We're Spider Mike.  All right.  Thank you.  Well, Alex...  So, Jay, are you still begging to get on Howard's show?  Are you still calling him up and begging and begging?  Jeff Ross, where are you going to be this weekend?  Caroline's.  What's that phone number?  212-757-4100, guys.  Who's opening for you?  I don't know.  Oh, I don't know.  That's all I got.  What did I see there?  Wednesday?  Does it matter?  Tonight through Sunday.  No.  Tonight through Sunday.  As long as it's not Bonnie. 
[02:11:00]  Oh.  Why?  Why does everyone fucking...  Oh, I didn't say all.  Come on, dude.  She's hilarious.  Rich Voss's wife.  I do think Bonnie's...  It's out of respect for Rich.  This is why I hate Voss's guts.  She told Howard I groped her.  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, why don't you come by tonight and practice your monologue so maybe you'll do great.  I'm just saying.  Jay Moore will be at Caroline's tonight with Jeffrey Ross.  I couldn't tell you why I wanted to hate Voss's guts.  Go ahead.  All right.  Why?  Because we're doing a New Year's Eve gig together in Philadelphia.  Tickets are not on sale yet. 
[02:11:30]  We're doing a tower theater with another third person.  Who books that?  Well, hey, you know.  I got a...  So I'm talking to Voss.  I'm like, let's do New Year's Eve together.  The first thing this fucking worm says to me is, can you get Bonnie on that?  They're like the new Steve Lawrence and Edie Gourmet.  They cannot perform alone.  They're like the uglier Kimmel Silverman.  They're going to destroy each other's careers.  They cannot be alone.  You hear Rich plugging his shows on here and it's like, me and Bonnie. 
[02:12:00]  She did HBO and Letterman.  Their comedy team should be called Bonnie and the Jewish Anchor.  He's a fucking lead tie.  Dueling middles.  Middle.  Hey, guys.  We got Bruce in Montreal.  Bruce.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Bruce.  Hello, Bruce.  Hi, Bruce.  Are you listening legally on XM Canada up there?  No, I am not.  Ah, another illegal guy.  I'm going to turn you in.  A buddy in Charlotte got me in about eight months ago. 
[02:12:30]  Really?  Oh, cool.  All right.  Do you know about XM Canada, sir?  I do know about XM Canada.  All right.  You don't see curious anywhere.  All you see are XM stuff all over the circulars and tablets.  Of course.  The XM is kicking ass already in Canada.  All right.  What do you got there, Bruce?  Got material for Jay.  Okay.  A sinful name for NASCAR.  Okay.  Non-athletic sports centered around rednecks.  Not bad.  It's not bad.  Shabby.  Not funny, but not bad.  Yeah, it's not funny, but it's accurate. 
[02:13:00]  It's one of these.  Oh.  Oh.  I got a good one for NASCAR.  National Association for Stock Car Automobile Racing.  That's funny.  Whoa.  Jay, come on.  You fucking think it.  They'll never let you get away with that.  All right.  Let's go to Louisiana.  Alex.  What do you want?  Tears from my eyes?  Yeah, how's it going?  All right, Alex.  Go.  Hey, Jay.  How about a guy that gets arrested for drunk driving named Kurt Busch, then goes on to  drive for Miller. 
[02:13:30]  Miller, Bush, you know.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  Give me six weeks.  Great in that.  Are you, um...  I just lost it again.  You're trying to give Jay material, huh?  Yeah, I think that's a dead-end fucking way to go.  The drunk driving thing?  No.  Giving NASCAR material.  No.  Well, but the whole thing is...  Unless you just showed how funny everyone is.  The guy named Bush driving for Miller?  Yeah, we get it.  Yeah, we get it.  Wait a minute.  You're saying that the guy drove for, uh... 
[02:14:00]  You're saying the irony is that his last name is Bush, he gets pulled over for drunk  driving, and then he drives for Miller.  You're saying that there's a whole alcohol tie-in?  Absolutely.  You stink.  Maybe it was his delivery.  Tell it with a little more confidence.  Yeah, could you try it again, sir?  Uh, no.  Why not?  Why not?  Man, I'll listen to y'all like four hours a day.  Come on, man.  You know.  A little pizzazz, would you?  All right, listen.  Go to SI.com and read my article about Michael Irvin.  Can we just read it on the air? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Yes, by the way, there's actually a really funny part with the article where Irvin responds.  Michael Irvin does respond on MySpace slash Jim Norton.  No, he doesn't.  So what?  What?  You can't have Michael Irvin respond?  With a whole bunch of racial epithets.  Jimmy Norton's stupid MySpace guy.  Yeah, you should.  It's cool.  What do you do?  You meet friends, Jay.  It's fun.  I have nothing to sell.  You plug things.  Right.  You're selling something.  You don't have to plug.  Plug Dane Cook on Saturday Live.  Oh, he's on SNL. 
[02:15:00]  You get into a pissing contest.  You can plug girls.  I wonder if Barry's so fucking crazy lately.  Is he ignoring you?  Dane's on SNL.  You know how it works.  It's crazy.  Barry can't believe...  I look like Dirk Nowitzki.  Barry can't believe he's allowed back in that building.  That's what happens, right?  And then all of a sudden, your management or agent...  Jay, come out of the time you left.  You left SNL during the broadcast and picked me up at the Boston Comedy Club and took me  down to Little Italy to get drunk.  Yeah.  You left another...  I guess you didn't have any...  That was in the book, right? 
[02:15:30]  He left me out of it, I think.  I left you out.  There was another story where you left...  Where were you when I was writing it?  Wasn't there a story where you left mid-show?  I had a panic attack.  I left.  I had to get out.  I read your book, Jay.  I thought my TV was going to fall on my head.  I read Jay Moore's book.  It was great.  I used to just leave and go to the Boston Comedy Club and get shit.  And people would be watching the monitors and be like, what?  But I thought...  Would you go back for the wave goodbye?  No, that's...  I was really...  That was my biggest thing was I couldn't stand the wave goodbye.  It was like the most offensive...  Because it was his wave hello. 
[02:16:00]  That's funny, man.  He's right.  Mean-spirited, but...  No, it's not.  It was true.  It was honest.  You were in the 20,000 leagues under the C-Bit in the striped shirt.  Me and David Tell were just wearing each other's dicks and balls in the background.  That's hysterical.  I remember going...  How come on on the front page?  What, Jeffy?  You have to go to more SI writers when you go to sportsillustrated.com.  That's fucking bad news.  I know.  Why aren't you one of the...  Can you go back to the front page?  Jeff Ross, Caroline's, tonight.  Through Sunday. 
[02:16:30]  If you live in Connecticut or anywhere outside the five boroughs, it's worth the drive.  Because Jeff Ross is as good as you're going to see.  I saw Jeffery at Avery Fisher Hall a couple weeks back.  What were you doing there?  That was great.  He absolutely killed.  I did a show for the New York Comedy Festival.  Dennis Leary hosted.  It was a bunch of...  Oh, nice.  Just about everyone that did the show does our show.  And Jeffery was one of the biggies that night.  I was killed.  Thanks, Hopi.  Well, come to Caroline's, and if you're listening, sit in the front row, and I'll personally make 
[02:17:00]  fun of your ugly ass.  Nice.  All right, Jay, we got another joke for you that you could use as you do the NASCAR gig.  Dale, South Carolina.  What's that?  Yeah.  Yes, you do.  I was just over there.  Am I on?  I just sprayed.  Doesn't make you a bad person.  No.  Get to the point, sir.  Quickly, we have big celebrities in here.  Yeah, I just wanted to...  I got another joke for Jay, if he's up for it.  Please.  I need all the help I can get.  What do Dale Earnhardt and Pink Floyd have in common? 
[02:17:30]  I give up.  Wait, I think I know this one.  Yeah?  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I know the answer, sir.  I'm trying to tell you the answer.  Jimmy's going to answer the question.  Okay, spoil it for me.  Go.  They broke up and then got back together because there was a broadcast recently.  No, the greatest hit was the wall.  That would go over well.  Jay?  Make a splash.  Yeah, why not, Jay? 
[02:18:00]  Wait, dude.  Let's go to Mike in Illinois.  Mike?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey.  Hi, Mike.  Hey, that joke that your cacksucker just said there in South Carolina, that was on Man Cow  four years ago, so that's old.  Oh, man.  All right.  Did you say that cacksucker right there?  That cacksucker?  That cacksucker.  Hey.  Which Belushi are you?  I was just at the race in Homestead there, Florida, a couple weeks ago.  Yeah.  There are hot chicks all over.  You guys got to get to a race if it ever comes in New York there.  I think we were supposed to do one of the races.  Richmond or something. 
[02:18:30]  I don't know what happened with that.  Yeah, what happened?  I don't know.  We were supposed to broadcast live.  We thought it would be pretty cool to do it.  Who cares about this NASCAR bullshit?  It's pretty big out there.  I haven't said a word about it.  I think NASCAR is very popular, and although I don't enjoy the sport, I think we have to acknowledge  its popularity.  It's very popular.  It's been popular for 10 years.  It's illustrated 10 years ago, said it.  Popularity.  I just wanted to make a funny noise with the word.  Let's go to Nashville.  The honor is popularity.  John, Nashville, what's up?  Hey, he could do a Christopher Walken doing the NASCAR broadcast or telling him, gentlemen, 
[02:19:00]  start your engines.  That's good.  Are you trying to set up Jay Moore?  I'm trying to set him up.  He's too busy reading the newspaper.  Maybe you could do this, sir.  Maybe you could do a funny thing about NASCAR and how, like, Harry Chapin would be good  if he wasn't on the L.I.E. that day.  Ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  You're a dullard and an ass.  He laughs at your joke.  He likes it.  I wish he was here. 
[02:19:30]  I'd like to tickle his ribs with a fist.  Tee-hee.  All right.  Hey, uh, oh, we got the Howard Stern audio.  Oh, we did?  Yeah, Eric got it.  E-Rock got it for Jay Moore.  E-Rock?  Jay Moore begging to be on my show, Robert.  Howard calling Jay Moore a loser.  Hey, uh, Mitch, you're on the air.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, Jay Moore ripped off one of your bits on  Jimmy Kimmel last night.  Ooh.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  And that, listen to that rat just calling in with false information.  No, no, no.  This guy's on my side.  This is great.  Was he? 
[02:20:00]  No, this guy's totally intimate.  What happened?  I forgot how this went.  No, he's setting up Howard because he knows.  This guy kills Howard.  This guy's a fan of mine.  Yeah, he knows.  Oh, great.  Good, I forgot how this went.  He knows all you have to do to get on the air is to say someone was ripping you off.  And then, of course, you're going to get right on the, uh, the, the show.  And Howard, uh, buys it.  Hook, line, and sinker.  Hey, uh, Mitch, you're on the air.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that, uh, Jay Moore ripped off one of your bits on Jimmy  Kimmel last night.  What did he do?  Uh, he was actually breathing while he was telling one of his jokes.  Kind of like you do.  I think you invented that. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, boy.  Hey, Jay, why don't you stop calling the show?  Oh, boy.  You hear the hole?  You hear the hole in the background.  Yeah, boy.  Oh, boy.  The worthless twat.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  One of the, the.  Can I do one or two?  Yeah, that's worth a million a year to the company.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's a bit.  All right.  Focus.  Focus, Jay.  Focus.  Focus.  Yeah, boy.  Hey, Jay, why don't you stop calling the show?  You're not coming on ever.  It's me.  So he thinks that's you? 
[02:21:00]  I'm the guy.  He thinks I'm missed.  Go back.  Stop calling the show.  Did you hear the show?  You think that fucking, I'm going to call, is a fake guy.  He's so full of himself.  It's just a listener, and Howard thinks it's actually Jay Moore.  You guys know my voice as well as anybody.  Yeah.  Like, just imagine Mrs. May.  All right, you want me to go all the way back?  You want me to hang up on him?  You can actually be me.  All right, here we go.  Hey, Mitch, you're on the air.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that Jay Moore ripped off one of your bits on Jimmy  Kimmel last night. 
[02:21:30]  What did he do?  He was actually breathing while he was telling one of his jokes, kind of like you do.  What does he say?  I think you invented that.  Yeah, boy.  Hey, Jay, why don't you stop calling the show?  You're not coming on ever.  He thinks that was you.  Antagonizing.  Yeah.  He knew it wasn't you.  He just didn't know how to get out of that, because it was kind of an embarrassing reveal  as to him complaining about everything.  He knew it wasn't you.  Ah, boy.  That's some good insight from Jim Martin.  That's a nice plug.  Good plug.  Very good.  That's a good plug.  I'm going to watch the NASCAR show.  You think you have more to do. 
[02:22:00]  Isn't Jay the comic who tried for years to get on our show and then trashed me on the  Opian Anthe show?  Absolutely.  Yeah, well, F him.  He stood on the side of the MTV Awards.  Yeah.  He stood there, not unlike Jim Carrey, ten years earlier, just waiting to get on the  And what a fucking loser.  He turned out to be a fucking big-mouthed asshole, Kenny.  Stop sucking Howard's ear.  I'm going to be at a fucking comic book store in Long Island this weekend, boy.  Oh, the guy every week.  He's got to be on the street fucking grubbing up chains. 
[02:22:30]  He still has to do bar gigs.  There's Howard taking care of you, Gary.  What kind of asshole is on a nationally syndicated radio show for us to plug his own bar gigs?  Oh, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Where are you going to be this weekend, Jimmy?  Nowhere.  Just kidding.  Dude, at least you're performing.  This guy's going there to be a lackey.  To show people what a lackey looks like.  He'll go to a bar.  Jeff Ross, Caroline.  Hi.  Thursday through Sunday.  Thank you.  Hi? 
[02:23:00]  That's what he'll say.  Hi.  Oh.  And that's his job.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo.  Stood there.  Not unlike Jim Carrey ten years earlier.  Just waiting to get on the show.  Jim got on and Jay didn't.  Right.  And so, you know, boo-hoo.  Boo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  So, after being a super fan, he trashes me because he's got no goddamn convictions or  morality or anything.  You hurt his feelings.  I have no convictions.  You know me?  I'm convictionless and rudderless.  I have no opinions about anything, and I've always been a super fan. 
[02:23:30]  But I was a bono and Gary Oldman.  Those are my super fan men.  Fucking Howard.  Some old skinny Jew.  That likes wearing rap clothes now.  Does he?  That's 53 years old.  Yeah, he was on Letterman in a rap outfit.  Let me tell you something, Dave.  And how about how he's just so tired of his own show, like when he's just going,  Give me the guy who, uh...  Like he can't, he's putting himself this...  He's somnambulistic to me.  What was that word? 
[02:24:00]  Somnambulistic.  I like it.  It's a very good word.  I've never heard it before.  Yes, you have.  But this is like a little quirk I have.  Like I'll hear a word, then look it up and write it down and make it part of my vocabulary.  Like if I ever have a character in a movie, that's going to be one of his endearing qualities.  Like Joe Pesci in that homeless movie would fondle rocks to remember things.  Ugh.  Remember that?  Oh, that was that Harvard movie.  With honors or something like that?  Yeah, it really got me.  Steve, Long Beach, what's up?  Hey, I got a joke for Jay.  All right.  How many NASCAR fans that take screwing a light bulb? 
[02:24:30]  How many?  Well, you can find that on eatabullet.com.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, fella.  Good plug.  Oh, that was nice.  That was a good one.  Back to the audio.  I heard his feelings.  Yeah, I heard his feelings because he's such a scary talent.  Now he's doing Star Search.  Great.  Good luck.  What a douchebag.  Now he's doing Star Search.  I thought he meant he was goofing on Last Comic.  I think he was goofing on Last Comic Standing.  Yeah.  Which was a national TV show. 
[02:25:00]  What's bad about having one of those?  It helped every comic in the country, including our very own Jim Morton.  And if you think about it, American Idol could be considered Star Search, one of the most popular shows on television.  One of the websites that you guys are friendly with, I've got to take issue with, and that's...  Fuck!  I'm going to forget what it is.  Opinopity.com?  Myspace slash Jim Norton.  No.  Cringe humor.  Oh, cringe humor, yeah.  They got me listed as one of the all-time worst comics ever.  On their hack and network sellout.  Wow.  But then they review, like, a Rich Voss, Bonnie McFarlane, and, like, Alonzo Bowden show, and Dave Mordal show, and they'll give the show an A+. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, boy.  And it's like, well, how can you call me a network sellout if you're giving an A-plus to the people that I put on television?  Like, how do you put me under fucking ant?  Like, go on it right now.  Go on Cringe Humor, and read what they write about me.  CringeHumor.net?  It's like, I steal all of Bobby Kelly's material.  I don't fuck a stool on stage. 
[02:26:00]  All right, as Anthony gets that up.  I'm not a sex addict.  Back to the audio.  Hold on.  Excuse me.  For the guy who just opened his asshole in front of me in the bathroom, not a sex addict.  I'm not saying it wasn't hot and appreciated.  Just saying you are.  I will say you did run into a stall like a little girl.  I used to open for Jay at colleges, and while I was on stage, he'd stand way, way, way in the back and pull his pants down.  Slap his dick around while I was kind of remembering my jokes.  Caroline's Thursday too soon.  There you go.  Jeffrey Ross.  You can do that when the opener goes along. 
[02:26:30]  All right, back to the audio as Anthony finds what you were talking about, Jay.  You certainly weren't going along.  Good luck.  By the way, I have to take back what I said about that show.  I watched the rest of it.  It was abominable.  All right.  Boy, New York comedians were really bad.  Really?  Oh, my goodness.  How good is a comedian going to be on television when you're not allowed to say anything?  I mean, seriously, think about it.  Well, they did do some bleeping, but meh.  And bleeping always makes everything funny.  Well, it made Ozzy funny, so I guess the comedians thought it would help them. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  She had nothing to add.  Good awful comedian.  Last Comic Standing was a good show.  It did help me.  It really was a good show.  It gave me a great relationship with The Tonight Show, which I can directly attribute.  It made Voss a headliner.  What other fucking plug do you need?  Rich Voss Headlines Distress Factory.  Norton had the best Tonight Show set I'd seen in 2000 and up.  Oh, thank you.  It was amazing.  I agree.  It really was amazing.  And you're always on with the hottest little fucking Hillary's.  That's because the girls request me. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  They do.  They all want to see.  How much about that?  They just want to touch my chin.  They know.  First, it was Hilary Duff, who I got to think for.  Is she cute in person?  Yeah, she's attractive.  She was sick the day she was on, though.  I didn't like the dress she was wearing.  I was wearing a 60-year-old fag, but I didn't like the dress she had on.  Does she have big tits?  I don't remember.  All right.  What do you think you don't remember?  I don't remember her tits.  I don't remember.  Jay Moore.  Here he is.  All right.  We found her.  Hold on.  Categories.  Has-been networks sell out traditional hack.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Description.  This hack, as I'm sure you saw on Last Comic Standing, was probably the wrong choice 
[02:28:00]  for a host of anything comedy-related.  He is a has-been for his awfully unfunny stint on SNL.  After seeing that, I don't know who in their right mind would let him back on television.  Networks sell out for trying to find the funniest person in America.  He failed.  He failed miserably and should be taken out back and treated like old yeller.  Upon catching part of his Comedy Central special, this seriously made me wonder what I had done  wrong as a human being.  My Comedy Central special was exceptional. 
[02:28:30]  So far, it's a very mixed review.  This was an hour of stolen and poorly reworked bits.  The bit that stuck out in my mind was his massage bit.  But it seems like not only does he share an agent with Robert Kelly, his agent gives him  Robert's act.  And I'm pretty sure he could fall under the female category simply for the fact Jay is  a massive cunt.  Wow. 
[02:29:00]  He is second only to Lisa Lampanelli.  Wow.  Did you blow him off for a picture or something?  Nothing.  Cool talk.  And his website, jmorealive.com.  It looks like Jay also stole webmaster Kurt Iverson's for this site.  Kurt Iverson's a fucking Mormon, by the way.  Jay Moore has sampled more than Vanilla Ice.  Who wrote that?  Submitted by Blue Flame.  You don't need a real name.  You don't need accountability.  You don't need to.  It's Blue Flame.  That's probably not his real name.  I would think. 
[02:29:30]  It's his American Gladiator name.  Blue Flame.  Like, that's really.  I mean, I'm in between Paul Mercurio and fucking Ant.  Paul Mercurio categories simply sucks.  Oh, wow.  Who's on top of me?  In this fucking double pen.  Charlie Veracola.  Oh.  How the hell can I make that list?  I'm a funny guy.  Simply awful and gimmicky hack he falls under.  Well, don't get too far from fucking me.  That was amazing. 
[02:30:00]  I mean, come on.  That was incredible.  Wow.  Am I in there?  No, they like you.  Richard Janney has been network sellout.  That fan, simply awful, ethnic garbage.  He's not a comic, so he doesn't belong on that website.  Lisa Lampanelli.  Lisa Lampanelli's funny.  Traditional hack female.  I dig Lisa Lampanelli.  Traditional hack?  Imagine Don Rickles with hideously misshapen breasts.  Her whole I love black pop gimmick.  There's nothing funny about Don Rickles.  No, but I think what they're saying there, and I've got to jump in and almost defend that  review, is the point he's making is a picture, like, what Rickles, he's not shitting on Rickles. 
[02:30:30]  Whoever wrote that is not shitting on him.  He has the sex appeal of Bea Arthur's rectum.  Wow.  That's a little mean to me.  Yeah, and that's not hacky at all.  Right.  But how did I get a review that awful?  That's scathing.  What did you do?  You guys have seen me perform probably a dozen times.  I love watching James.  Laugh my ass off.  Ant.  Carlos Mencia.  Like, how did I make this list?  Carlos Mencia.  No, why are you plugging it?  You're the one who plugged the website and told everybody about it. 
[02:31:00]  Because I wanted to know how he can review a Rich Voss...  Well, let's get him on the air.  A Rich Voss, Dave Mordell, Bonnie McFarlane show, give the show an A+.  They came from a show I created, and then called me a network sellout.  Fuck you, you fat, bald fuck that has no talent, so all you do is make fun of people.  The show was good when it first started, but in the end, by season three, it was definitely  a sellout.  No, that's NBC's fault, because we didn't want...  But they don't know that.  Some schmuck with a laptop.  We didn't want to do the show.  They pushed for a third season way too soon.  They wanted to do a third season a month after the second season ended. 
[02:31:30]  You agreed.  You can't tell a network, no, I'm not going to take your 25-episode order.  You're out.  Right.  Yeah.  You can't say no, boss.  What if you said no?  What would have happened?  You're done.  They would have replaced you.  They would have...  They'd do it with somebody else.  I would have done it.  Who runs this site?  It's Pat.  That big fat bald guy.  It's Pat.  He was in here once, and I think Club Soda Kenny interviewed him.  Patrick.  Oh, did he try to do the news once?  And then he trashes me because he thought I set him up to fail on the show. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  He has no...  Look at the picture of the guy.  He has absolutely no skills in front of an audience or in front of a microphone.  He looks like the guy that doesn't get laid in the photo.  And he bombed horribly on our show, and then he trashed me on the website saying I set him  up to fail.  Did he trash you on the website, though?  Fuck yeah, he did, man.  Oh, so you're with me.  I never forgot that.  Yeah, of course he did.  He had horrendous things to say.  Featured comedians, Dane Cook, Ben Bailey, Greg Geraldo, Lurie Kilmartin, Keith Robertson, 
[02:32:30]  Steve Byrne.  All right, you know what?  This isn't going anywhere.  Why don't I take a break?  I like hearing names right now.  Well, it's better than hearing fucking NASCAR jokes, Opie.  Well, we're just like...  That was...  Why did Jimmy's friends have to wait so long before they come in here?  Not anymore.  We got through that.  Do you know that site was originally...  Cringe Humor originally was morphed from JimNortonFans.com, and then it changed.  And the word cringe came from our show.  Really? 
[02:33:00]  And we're doing the whole cringe radio angle.  So, I mean, you know...  And I've retired from stand-up, so take me off that fucking thing.  Are you retired?  Hey, why don't we play some comedy instead of speaking of comedy?  I'm going to try to get us to break here.  Why don't we play a little Jimmy Norton on the Tonight Show?  No, no, no, no.  Can I hear the Bowling song with Stephen Lynch?  Something funny.  Wait, no, hey, wait a minute.  You don't think Jimmy Norton's funny?  That was a backhanded compliment.  No, I think Jimmy's very funny.  Wait, all right, Jay, what do you want to hear?  I want to hear the Bowling song with Stephen Lynch.  I don't. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, boy.  Who asked you?  When people are talking, it's none of your business.  Especially when it's me and my brother.  Play the version from the CD where he explains the whole thing.  No, I hate that part.  What?  He's like, I don't want to play it.  There were drunken people and fucking rascals in orange.  Play it!  Because we forced him to play it.  No, really, I don't.  I don't want to play it.  Come on!  Here's the history.  He came in and played the Bowling song on our show, and we trashed him.  We said, we like what you do, but you finally played a clinker.  A clunker.  How could you say that?  A clunker.  Well, that's what we said at the time, and we made fun of him, and then we told everyone 
[02:34:00]  who was going to the show to request a song, so we put him in a strange spot that night.  Look at Muffler.  Who's that?  Muffler rules.  That's one of my friends.  Fucking.  Who's the girl?  She's hot, man.  She's on, uh...  Is that the one?  All right.  This is a Jay Moore request.  Do you want to do it?  It's, uh...  You got the one from the CD?  Have you heard his Bowling song?  All right.  Derek's got it.  Listen to this.  Before you...  Dude...  Well, actually, we should stop and give Jeffrey Ross a plug.  He's playing Caroline. 
[02:34:30]  He's a very funny guy.  Our friend.  Friend of the show.  He's, uh...  He's there.  How can you?  Oh, yeah.  All these big mouths.  A lot of big mouths.  Uh...  Today through Sunday, Caroline's...  The phone number, Jimmy?  Is, uh...  212-757-4100.  Jeff Ross.  Uh...  You know him from all those Comedy Central roasts, which he is brutal on and really funny.  All right.  As we go to break, it's a Jay Moore request.  Steven Lynch doing the Bowling Song.  Bowling Song!  Sorry, I don't know that song. 
[02:35:00]  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  That fucking bowling song would be the death of me.  Half the people here don't even know what you're talking about, by the way.  I wrote a song called Almighty Malachi Professional Bowling God.  I probably wrote it ten years ago.  It was one of the first songs I ever wrote, and one time I went on Opie and Anthony. 
[02:35:30]  And I had, uh...  I had...  I had no new material, but I wanted to, you know, plug a show, so I had to do something.  And I reached back in the vault, and I pulled out Almighty Malachi Professional Bowling God.  And not only did they not laugh, they made so much fucking fun of this song.  They just said it there...  You know, they never played it again.  And they made me play it yesterday on the radio, just to humiliate me. 
[02:36:00]  So if you really want to hear it...  Why?  Why do you want to hear this song?  All right.  By the way, forget that it's about bowling.  You're not supposed to know that at the beginning of the song.  I'll just play it fast.  You think my sport's pathetic. 
[02:36:30]  But you can't judge me till you've walked a mile in my bowling shoes. 
[02:37:00]  So I don't get all the ladies got a mullet from the 80s.  I'm known throughout the valleys as the prophet of the alleys. 
[02:37:30]  And as I roll the ball, I cry, let me bowl and let me die.  I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling god.  The smell of rising gets me high.  Kiss the fucking pins goodbye.  I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling, bowling god.  Thank you for coming out to the island. 
[02:38:00]  All right, one more verse.  I got a ball that's smooth and all black.  Uh-huh.  I keep it in my favorite ball sack.  Oh, yeah.  I get a tough feeling in my soul.  As I finger every hole, and as I roll the ball, I cry, let me bowl and let me die. 
[02:38:30]  I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling god.  The smell of rising gets me high.  Kiss the fucking pins goodbye.  I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling, bowling.  And not a single man will try to beat Almighty Malachi.  All who challenge me are slain.  Come on, fuckers, pick a lane.  Marshal Holman, Gary Dickens, get in line for your ass kickin'.  John Petraglia, North Duke, you're so lame it takes me puke. 
[02:39:00]  Who among the provost sector dares to down his wrist protector?  Not that pussy, Nelson Burton.  Tell me that his wrist is hurtin'.  Hey, my bra, hey, Earl of the Pearl.  I ain't scared to give the ball a hurl.  How about Dickie Weber and his son Pete?  I'll tear the motherfuckers the cream of wheat.  And now I roll the ball, I cry, let me bowl and let me die.  I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling god.  The smell of rising gets me high.  Kiss the fucking pins goodbye.  I'm Almighty Malachi, the bowling, bowling god. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah.  The bowling god.  This is unpredictable radio.  Holy crap. 
[02:40:00]  We need to remember that we are professionals in the entertainment industry.  Look at you.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  I'm a grown man and I'm being yelled at.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're idiots.  Who hasn't poked a log before?  We've all done it.  That's what we're talking about now.  I have never touched my own shit. 
[02:40:30]  Look, man.  What are you, gang?  Or anyone else's, for that matter.  Dude, it was yesterday.  It took a good half hour to get this one three-inch nugget out.  And I thought, uh, huh?  What are your lack of water dumps?  Too much Vicodin.  Too much Vicodin?  Yeah.  And, uh, I was a little worried.  I'm like, why did it take so long for this to come out?  It felt like I was like, as they say, giving birth.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I don't know how it...  So I went for the poke to see if everything was all right.  And it was, it was like hard as a rock.  I mean, hard as a rock. 
[02:41:00]  I touched it with your fucking finger?  I touched it and nothing went on my finger.  That's how hard and clean it was.  And I pointed out that what Opie did was he helped a rascal.  You've never poked a log just to see what's going on.  Opie, you ripped you off.  Did you poke a log?  You've poked logs, right?  I'm poking the log.  It's on that goddamn video.  I'm the log poking kid.  I didn't see you actually poking the log on that video.  He's a real fudge smeller.  I did not look.  You didn't see help a rascal?  He's flushing his toilet and his trailer.  That's not me.  I mean, someone midge me.  No, you just said it was you. 
[02:41:30]  Midge me.  I know.  He's trying to flush a crap down the toilet, but it's one of those trailer toilets, so  it's not in water.  It's like the airplane where the bottom just kind of opens up.  Yeah.  And some liquid pours down.  Yeah.  And it wouldn't go because it was straddling the hole like a suspension bridge.  And he took his finger and poked it.  No.  Yes, you did.  I helped.  I helped in life.  Until it went down, and that was disgusting.  It wasn't.  I helped that little rascal along.  You act like you've never helped a rascal. 
[02:42:00]  What a rude.  Why you're helping a rascal again?  All right.  Well, whatever.  Have you ever seen Helper Rascal Jay?  I'll get you a copy of it.  Yeah.  Let Jimmy play it for you.  All right.  Jay's wandering around the studio, and we've got a question finally for Jeffrey Ross,  who's playing Carolines this weekend.  Yes.  Tonight through Sunday.  Jeff from New Orleans.  What's up?  Hey.  I wanted to see if Jeffrey Ross got in trouble with the Negroes when he made a comment  about Shaquille O'Neal at his roast, about walking to the event because his knuckles 
[02:42:30]  were scraped.  I got respect from the Negroes that day, man.  Oh, you did?  You got props?  I was the only white guy on that show.  I roasted Shaq on pay-per-view.  They probably beat the living pits out of you after that, huh?  I said, Shaq, your knuckles look scraped.  Did you walk here?  And you got away with that?  Well, yeah.  We've seen, yeah.  I said, come on.  I'm not trying to say Shaq looks like a gorilla, but I did see him try to peel the microphone.  That's a fucking comment, dude.  That was the best joke.  I was on the ground.  It's amazing what he gets away with on those things. 
[02:43:00]  Yes.  Jeffrey Ross at Carolines all weekend long here in New York City.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Rob.  Hey, Rob.  An old bit from the olden days at NEW when Jay Moore, the funny bastard, did Harry  Cowher and Anthony did Bob Murphy.  I laughed at that today.  Oh, yeah.  Punch it out, boys.  You can probably find that on OAVirus.com.  Right.  Remember?  Right.  Good olden days.  Punch Husky's not a handsome.  Because we can't really play the old stuff on the new show.  Hey, guys.  I'm not a fan. 
[02:43:30]  I've got to interrupt.  Yeah, thank you, Jimmy, because he's dressed and ready to go.  We're going to lose our own Nathaniel for the rest of today.  Oh, gnarly.  There you go.  Oh, my goodness.  Looks like a fucking Mormon.  Where is a picture?  You're so handsome.  Thank you.  Look at you in your shoes.  They're crazy.  Yeah, they stink.  You're bangs me more cowbell.  You bangs me more cowbell.  I actually, unfortunately, really have to make this brief Opie.  Oh, well.  What's wrong with his bangs? 
[02:44:00]  You're a guy in a red shirt on Star Trek.  I don't think he knows what side of that bread the butter is on.  And let me explain something.  I'm going to call you out.  What time did you tell me when we got here that you had to leave today?  10 o'clock.  No, you didn't.  You said 10.30.  No, I have the auditions at 10.30.  And where is it?  West 15th and West End.  No one's on time these days.  What's it for?  Certainly not peons.  What's it for?  It's for an Avis rental car commercial.  Avis rental car.  And you will go, I need a car?  Uh, something on the line. 
[02:44:30]  What's your line?  Wait, he's going to do the whole thing for us.  How many lines do you have?  How many lines do you have in a later appointment?  Just one.  Oh, just one?  I tried.  Set up the scene.  Tell us what your line is.  And you look lovely in your suit.  Thank you.  Are you holding sides in your hands?  Yeah.  You won line zero?  Yeah.  You can't remember it?  We'll run the sides?  No.  Yeah, let Jeff be the other person.  No, that's right.  Come on.  Yeah, come on.  He'll help you out.  He'll help you out.  You're a poor man.  This is the worst.  Come on.  Come on now.  Okay, welcome.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Come on.  I've never seen a fan like this in my life. 
[02:45:00]  I'm enjoying this.  C-3PO Lerud.  It is fucking C-3PO in a suit, this fucking guy.  If I make Jimmy laugh, I'm done.  Jesus.  Oh, that made me happy.  He'll give you a good trashy fan.  Thank you very much for coming in.  So, I'll give you a little set up.  Open on a three business.  Open on.  Here's what it says.  You stink.  Read what it says in the first sentence.  I missed print.  Open on a three business man in business suits driving in a car. 
[02:45:30]  Open on the three business men.  You're one of the business men, apparently the one whose head is in the lap of the other  two.  It has an uh in there for no reason.  Open on a three business man in business suits driving in a car.  You're playing one of them.  Yes.  Listening to some hardcore rap music.  Yeah.  Okay.  I see.  This is getting funny already.  It's goofy.  Yeah.  They're sunken down in their seats.  Very ghetto-like.  Yeah.  After about ten seconds, the passenger's cell phone rings.  Is that you?  Yes.  Oh.  He sees that it's his boss calling and fumbles nervously with the phone. 
[02:46:00]  The three of them quickly turn the music down, sit up straight and act professional.  Uh-huh.  You be the passenger.  All right.  Ring.  Hello, Mr. Thomas.  We're about 20 minutes away.  See you then.  He closes his phone and they turn rap back on and slouch back down in their seats.  Announcer says, over 100 channels of rap, rock, sports, and more with XM satellite radio  at Avis.  Oh.  What a tie-in. 
[02:46:30]  It's an XM spot for Avis.  Yeah.  The logo comes up.  I don't think you have to go down there.  The goofy white guys.  Goofy white guys.  We're going to see Than fumbling.  Where's the video cameras?  That's a wigger spot.  That's a wigger spot.  Yeah.  Want to try a little bit more naturally to say?  Looks like Jeff Stilson.  Yeah.  How are you going to deliver?  I hope not like you just delivered.  That was good, actually.  That was very stiff.  Hello.  Slouch down.  You're listening to some hip-hop.  There's a chair.  Bring him a chair.  Get him a chair.  There's a chair, Dad Than. 
[02:47:00]  We've...  I don't know.  C-3PO the road.  I think...  I thought that did better, yeah.  Does he look like C-3PO?  He really does.  Uh-oh.  What, Data?  Alright.  Let's go.  Jeffrey.  There's a cox when she was on Star Trek, when she was like seven years old, with Data.  Ooh.  Oh, Data.  Someone pull it up on the internet.  It's fucking amazing.  Back to Jeffrey Roth. 
[02:47:30]  Wait, where's the video camera?  Get that martini fruit bear in here with the fucking camera.  I shaved my arms.  Yeah, he really is awful.  Harry's chest.  He's a fucking weirdo.  Hey, get Steve in here, too.  Show off my paint.  Here's Steve.  Alright, you're slouching.  Hey, buddy.  We'll listen to hip-hop.  No, nothing.  No.  Jay, you're going to do a little hip-hop background?  Hold on.  It's going to be a lot of slow singing and flabble.  Do we have rap music that we can play?  Let's set this all up.  What you think all the guns is for? 
[02:48:00]  We have some rap music.  No, alright.  Here we go.  Hold on, Derek.  Hold on.  You're going to have a mic in your hand?  No.  So we can't give him a mic in his hand.  But we have to be able to hear it.  Well, somebody could mic me.  I'm wrapping my black balls off over here.  We got a mic, sweetie.  You don't need the headphones, dude.  That's unnatural for you.  You won't need the headphones.  No, he's got to hear it for his cues.  I've got to play a phone ringing.  Oh, okay.  And he's got to hear the rap music.  Yes.  Okay.  The phone ringing should also sound like a gunshot. 
[02:48:30]  Alright, here we go.  Data, Stilson, Overload.  Is everyone ready?  Yeah.  Wait, we've got to get the rap music on first.  Derek?  The cue for the phone is Avis.com.  When I say Avis.com, you hit the phone.  Alright.  Alright.  Are you ready?  I'm ready.  Are you ready?  Hector?  Yes.  Announcer.  Alright.  Got to cue the music, I guess.  Cue the music.  I have no idea.  I wasn't listening.  Women should have teleprompters over their heads. 
[02:49:00]  I'm just...  Cue the music.  I'm teasing.  Another way we try harder to make your business trip better.  As always, our best cards and our lowest prices are at Avis.com.  Fuck.  Yes, Mr. Thomas?  No, it says yes, hello, Mr. Thomas.  Oh, God.  And I don't think you say, oh, fuck, when you open the phone.  And you're not dancing.  You've got to move a little bit.  What happened? 
[02:49:30]  Was there a problem?  Come on, Data.  Was there a problem with the...  Alright, let's rewind.  Let's get the rap music again from the top, as they say.  He's working without his batting helmet.  Here we go.  Cue the music.  It's Master Luke.  Take two.  Just know the way we try harder to make your business trip better.  As always, our best cards and our lowest prices are at Avis.com.  I feel like this isn't a good simulation of the audition, because Jay Moore won't be cackling at my audition. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah, Jay, if you can kind of control yourself.  Well, he's got to...  We're really trying to help him out for his audition.  He's got to move a little bit, because you're supposed to be slumped out and enjoying the rap.  I know it's embarrassing here.  No.  Alright, come on.  This is fun.  Oh, it's Master Luke.  Do you know what I'm doing?  Alright, listen.  Listen, let's...  He's got to go soon.  He's looking at the clock.  He's very nervous. 
[02:50:30]  Hold on.  The guy's very nervous.  He's got to get there by 10.  Yeah, he does one year, one minute.  They might give the part to another retard.  Alright, here we go.  From the top.  Let's get this straight.  From the top.  Take three.  Take three.  Come on, James Dawson.  I'm getting good sport points on this one.  Come on, droopy dog.  Alright.  Here we go.  And music.  It's another way.  We try harder to make your business trip better.  As always, our best cars, our lowest prices are at amos.com. 
[02:51:00]  Wouldn't you react to the sound of the phone ringing, or would you just sit there like a cigar  is slower ending?  Holy Jesus.  It's like the phone ringing.  Oh, my God.  Take four.  It's Master Luke.  Take four.  Oh, no.  How many chances do you think you'll get at the audition?  When are you going to dance to the rap music?  If you can do it here, you won't be nervous.  Yeah, you've got to slump down in the seat more.  You've got to.  And you've got to dance to the music.  And by the way, this is not why they call it everything about it is appealing. 
[02:51:30]  Because the dramatic moment is now when the boss calls, you've got to all sit up.  And now you're stiff again.  You're stiff white people.  Instead of looking at this as a negative, take some professional actors' advice.  Yeah, you've got to dance around to the music.  Use this as a rehearsal.  That's right.  You've got to slump in the seat like you're fucking ready to gank somebody.  There's a professional actor here?  Oh!  I'm going to take that!  There's a couple of no-pay interns, though.  I see that.  No, you've got to, Jeff.  You've got to dance a little bit. 
[02:52:00]  You've got to have no shame.  Yeah, no shame.  You're making an ass out of yourself in front of two countries.  It's not important.  The important thing is the audition.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  No shame.  All right.  It's the John Olerud.  Exactly.  Concentrate.  Herman Munster hair.  Have a quiet place.  Quiet.  Leave John Olerud hairdo alone.  Go ahead.  Come on, Fred Gwynn.  At Avis Lily.  Now, Eddie, get in the Avis car.  All right. 
[02:52:30]  All right, everyone.  Quiet on the set.  Quiet on the set.  Quiet on the set.  Music from the top.  Take four.  Ah, Lily.  Take four or five.  We're at five now.  Where's Grandpa?  Easy to be.  I'm fucking late, but I'll be humiliated beforehand.  You'll be terrific.  Win-win for me.  You'll be terrific.  You're on a black show auditioning.  You're not going to be the only late one.  Come on.  All right, here we go. 
[02:53:00]  Music.  This is another way we try harder to make your business trip better.  As always, our best cars and our lowest prices are at avis.com.  Yes, hello, Mr. Thomas.  We're about 20 minutes away.  I'll see you there.  I'd like to see him again.  Maybe tomorrow.  I'd like to see him again. 
[02:53:30]  But I'm going to bring in some balls from Mitch for you to sign.  What was it like playing with Ricky Henderson in 92?  What's the Boston name?  Ricky played last year when a guy had a helmet on his head.  Mr. Thomas.  Yes, Mr. Thomas.  I'll be down at the parlor in a moment or two.  Oh, Dragula's not starting today.  Lily, Lily, get Grandpa.  Eddie, Eddie, get down from that tree.  He's in the basement making penicillin. 
[02:54:00]  He's got to go.  He's got to go.  He's got to go.  Well, Herman, good luck with your audition.  Oh, that might be Mr. Thompson.  Hopefully it's not Mr. Thompson.  Thomas.  I would say you've got to dance more in the beginning.  Agreed.  It'd be like a white guy getting into the hip-hop-y stuff.  Oh, you had.  You probably didn't want to do it here.  Dan doesn't get a part in that commercial.  It's perfect for him.  He was the greatest peak of ass I've ever had.  And I've had him all over the world.  Oh, it's funny. 
[02:54:30]  He's going to find an Asian head in his bed.  How did my audition go?  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk McFriend.  Dan, Dan.  Hey, Dan.  The only thing that would make me happier is if someone drives by and splashes mud on that dumb suit.  Beat it, Undertaker.  Go tend to a cadaver, that fucking suit.  He left his sides here, too.  He can't even practice in the cab on the way.  Oh, did he miss?  Yeah, give me.  Tell him Mr. Thomas called.  Jay, Jay. 
[02:55:00]  Jay, I got it.  All the rude pictures.  Travis is passing out all the rude pictures.  That's very similar.  He's probably bringing some balls and Mitch for you to sign.  How about, you know the Ricky Henderson story?  He goes, when they were on the mess together and Ricky Henderson goes,  Nicky, notice you played with a helmet on your head.  Ricky played last year when the dude had a helmet on his head.  It's the same guy.  It's fucking old.  It was old, the rude. 
[02:55:30]  Good lord.  That's funny.  All the fucking photoshops are going to be great.  C3PO.  Fucking data.  John Olderwood is C3PO.  And let's hear it for Jeffrey Ross.  He did great.  Yes.  Helping out Than.  He'll be at Caroline's all week long.  How great would he be at the phone rang and they hired Jeff?  You know he's going to get there and they're going to use that same, like, prompt ring and it's going to fuck him up.  It's going to throw him, yeah.  I hope he'll distract him.  All right, let's go to George in Chicago.  George. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey, George.  There's comedy gods in the studio and then there's Stan.  What?  Huh?  Your mother sucks.  Big elephant dick.  Goodbye.  Go ahead.  Bye-bye.  Sal, is this you?  Stop funny no more.  Go, George.  Yeah, Jeff.  Two of Jeff's favorite, my favorite lines from him doing comedy roast is Dr. Ruth's vagina's old.  She's got mice and punch out.  And what?  But you said you had two lines.  Okay.  He punched out before the second line.  Flea Man, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[02:56:30]  How's it going?  All right, Flea Man.  I just wanted to defend cringe humor.  I just wanted to say if you've got a problem with it, then you can go to The Laugh Factory December 8th at 9 p.m.  It's Robert Kelly, Nick DiPaolo, Russ Meneve, Jim Florentine, Steve Byrne, Big A, and Paul Field are going to be there.  They're doing a spot.  And it's hosted by the great Mark Anthony Ramirez.  Big A doing a spot.  What's that got?  If you have a problem with the website, why would you go to The Laugh Factory?  Well, you can go.  You can just have a good time and see some good comedy. 
[02:57:00]  No, but you said if you have a problem with that, you can go to The Laugh Factory.  He was trying to make some sort of connection.  Play along, stupid.  Jesus.  He's going to be with Bill Burr.  The guy who runs the site is going to be there, so, you know, you can go there and talk to him.  Who?  Patrick.  No, who's going to go talk to him?  No, Pat can call our show.  Oh, well.  What?  We'll get him to call.  Why would he go?  I'm over here now.  Well, you can go to The Laugh Factory December 8th. 
[02:57:30]  But do I get a hat?  Why would I?  Who's going to go talk to him?  I don't know.  You, Jay, if you want.  All right.  Thank you, Flea.  You're welcome.  It was an awful phone call.  Who are your favorite comics?  No, he's gone.  He's gone.  Rossman Eve?  He's gone.  Guy took a dump on purpose on the last comic?  Did a what?  Nothing.  Ooh.  What happened, Jay?  Who happened?  What happened now?  When's Robert Patrick calling in?  Yes, I see his bio has been brought to us.  He's calling in in two minutes.  He's a good man. 
[02:58:00]  I'm making a movie with him.  Are you?  A little thing called Lonely Street where he plays in Elvis Presley.  Who do you play?  I play Bubba, a bumbling private eye that's hired to track down a stalker of a celebrity.  And when I get to the top floor of the Holiday Inn in Albuquerque, it turns out Elvis Presley's  alive and he lives there.  But wait, that's kind of like Graceland with Harvey Keitel.  I see it.  Can't be accused of stealing it.  Not you, stealing it, it's just a similar concept.  I want to be in the movie.  Wait, Sam.  Sam. 
[02:58:30]  This little flowery pussy.  That's pretty funny.  This thing is leaving.  He lets the mic go over by Ant.  Sounds like Tinkerbell just farted.  Well, I'm a verse.  Yeah, but they stink, man.  They don't have a wallop, but they stink.  I like when people go, oh, it fucking stinks.  It's like, yeah, it's the inside of my fucking asshole.  Yeah, but when Jimmy farts, it doesn't stink.  Wow, look how fucking coked out Paula Abdul is, a Tony dancer.  She's like, I'm completely normal.  That's why I decided to wear a planned suit. 
[02:59:00]  Fucking dumb cunt.  Let's go to Ryan.  Cox was one of her dancers when she was a kid and said she was fucking to a wacko then.  Yeah, let's go to Ryan in Wisconsin.  Ryan.  How's it going?  It's fantastic.  Oh, sweet.  I just, I have a little bit of a problem here with Mr. Jay Moore, who I totally love and  think it's hilarious.  The cringe humor guys are kind of throwing him under the bus and calling him a hack, but  then he goes out and hacks Jim Rome and uses the C3P Olerud line, which I think is kind  of strange to be stealing a joke from Jim. 
[02:59:30]  Uh, Jay, comment on this, um, any, uh, you know what, I've decided, I'm not, hey, I'm  going to steal a little bit too.  War, Wisconsin, hockey, I'm out.  All right.  Very good.  Well, we, uh, I'm not like Patrick Hall in the show in a few minutes.  I've done the other way where I go, hey, let me tell you something, pal, and now I just  let it sit.  Good. 
[03:00:00]  Hey, look.  Let it simmer.  I don't like all this hurtful talk back and forth.  It's mean-spirited.  Let's see, uh, Die Hard 2.  Copland, that was good.  I liked Copland, he was in that.  That was the last thing that, I don't remember him in that, that was the last thing Stallone  did that I didn't want to smash him for.  The dart in his nose.  Remember they were, uh...  Wow, okay.  Yeah, did that.  Karen!  He wouldn't have found it!  That's all we had, Karen!  The helicopter's been following me all day, I'm telling you! 
[03:00:30]  And then his brother in the wheelchair goes, get the fuck out of here.  All I know is this.  He took over for, uh, uh, Mulder on the X-Files, when the X-Files, uh...  That's the fucking kiss of that.  That's really bad.  This show ran for 12 years, your turn.  I know, step in.  That's like if I did fucking, uh, if they go, like, hey, do NYPD Blue now.  After Rick Schroeder.  Your turn, Jay.  Mark Paul Gossler, Rick Schroeder, the U. 
[03:01:00]  Step up!  Dude, he was the fucking, the, the, the Millennium Terminator.  He was in From Dusk Till Dawn 2.  Who?  Robert Patrick's great.  Robert Patrick.  He was in Terminator 2.  Wow, Paula Abdul is fucking gone.  She's pretty, though.  She's a fucking Lebanese twat.  Is she Lebanese?  What is she?  She ain't white.  Probably has a nice meaty one.  Hairy back.  Nice meaty vag.  You like the meaty.  I fucking, I want it to look like a giant pile of deli meat. 
[03:01:30]  Like they got a bat following down the stairs?  I fucking love that more than I love anything.  It should look like someone took a normal vagina and is crunching it between two ape fists.  What is it?  About, I think, I think you're going to come out of the closet when you're 40.  What's a gay about that?  I didn't say anything.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  More pussy the merrier.  I want more pussy.  I don't want less pussy.  Yeah, but.  If you like thin Asian eye vaginas, you could be gay because that's less pussy.  No.  You could flick your tongue out like a Tic Tac.  Oh, blah, blah, Asian pussy. 
[03:02:00]  No.  There's got to be a compromise there.  Yes.  I agree with you with the Asian prostitutes.  They give you that.  It should look like a fucking, like, you ever see like a, under the ocean when the earth buckles  and how the fucking ground just comes up and bubbles?  That's what a vagina should look like.  You don't want anything coming out.  I don't care if it comes out or if it stays in.  That's what I, you don't want it coming out.  Why?  I don't want pussy hiding.  I want pussy being free.  You don't want it to look like a little, uh, little scalpel, uh, wound.  Yes, you do.  I want you, but you want it to have some bulk to it.  Blossom.  But you don't want anything coming out. 
[03:02:30]  If it comes out of mine, it reminds me of Nathan Lane.  Just the arms are all out.  Hello.  You kiss it.  You do producer lines and kiss it.  Like Billy Crystal when he starts the Oscars.  Yeah, exactly.  Or when he blows me off for a picture.  No cameras.  Sorry, millionaire.  Or when he's not a nice person ever.  What's that?  Or when he's not a nice person ever.  Oh, he's a nice person.  Oh, he's terrific.  It's because you're Jewish.  Maybe.  He's terrific.  Jews like Jews.  Yeah.  Now, Billy is a nice guy.  Hey, we got a phone call from Georgia, North Carolina.  Go ahead there.  Hey, Jay, guys. 
[03:03:00]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  I have water in my mouth.  Yes, sir.  I wanted to tell Jay not to take all these attacks too personally, because my favorite  Jay Moore appearance was the day that Opie and Jimmy went toe-to-toe.  We're going to slit each other's throats, and Anthony was hiding behind the console, and  Jay was keeping the show afloat.  Well, Jay started showing his ass and stuff to everyone to comment.  I know.  Thanks.  Tom, everybody.  I don't think it was here that day. 
[03:03:30]  I don't think it.  Thank you, brother.  I don't think it personally at all, because...  That was a hell of a day, though.  I forgot about that.  Jay was here.  Jay pulled his pants down in the middle of this crazy fight outside the studio and squashed  his junk against the glass.  But the fight had nothing to do with it.  He just couldn't wait to show his cock anymore, so he couldn't wait until the argument was over.  You want to see it right now?  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  What if I was Hilary Duff's head, and it was my dick? 
[03:04:00]  What if?  A lot of what ifs there.  A lot of important what ifs.  What color were her eyes?  Who knew?  All right, let's talk about poker for a second.  Yes.  Let's talk about when you reach a point in your life when you absolutely don't care anymore.  Oh.  Do you like what a vagina looks like when it's bulging through the panties?  Yeah.  Like when you pull the panties...  RateMyCamelToe.com?  That's a very fine site.  No, but not even just camel toe, but like where it stacks up.  What?  Like sphinx pussy.  Like a fucking big sphinx in her undershorts. 
[03:04:30]  Like ribbon candy?  No, but it's...  Ribbon candy.  I hate when I laugh at my own shit, but I can't help it.  I'm good.  You want to see one...  You don't get ribbon candy jokes every day, so that's a good...  It's the reason they call it a muff.  No, I don't like hair.  Because it's like muffin-like.  No, no.  Okay.  It's like...  Yeah, muffin-like.  It should look like a gunny sack full of boiled potatoes.  Exactly.  Just a pile of loveliness. 
[03:05:00]  It should.  That you can kiss and smell and do impressions to.  Who likes poker in this room?  Oh, I love poker.  I do.  I'll pan just one up.  You don't play poker.  I do.  But I want it to be part of the team.  I love it.  Jeffrey, you play the poker?  Of course.  Love it.  I gotta piss.  Look at this.  What do you mean you have to piss?  I gotta piss.  Where would you go if you want to learn how to play a little poker?  Because you go online.  I don't know.  You're gonna get taken.  Yeah.  Taken for a ride.  You gotta find some transitional place somewhere you can go and learn about the game.  Jimmy has to piss and Jay Moore is running out of the studio. 
[03:05:30]  You gotta follow him.  To shove his ass in his face.  I think that's what happened during the last break.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We talked about that on the air.  No, I think that was off the air.  All right.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  If you go in the stall next to Jimmy and take a leak, he will piss under the stall  and try to hit your foot, by the way.  Very funny.  Jay's still in the studio.  That's Britney Spears.  And how come she's low?  Look at this.  Yeah, look at that.  She's got nothing to do.  She's just like a child.  Oh, no. 
[03:06:00]  You're an adult child, man.  He'll like a child.  He'll go, what's this?  She's always been like that.  Fred Durst was here in her vagina.  We're gonna try to talk about poker for just one minute.  Yeah.  Well, where do you go?  I don't know.  I'm thinking bodog.net.  Bodog.net.  What do you want to know, huh?  You want to know how to bet?  When to bet?  I want to know when to bluff.  When you should bluff?  I want to know when Jeff Ross' shows are at Caroline's.  In the middle of a spot. 
[03:06:30]  Thanks, Jesus Christ.  Jay, you really should come by and practice your jokes.  I want to set up a Lysol sprinkler that just goes...  Jay farted and walked out.  Yeah, thank you.  That's a true friend.  But he felt like if he plugged my Caroline's date, he wouldn't make it okay.  Everything would be okay, right?  I've got to sit here and endure his fart.  Jeffrey Ross, an amazing comic at Caroline's tonight and through Sunday.  It's bodog.net.  B-O-D-O-G.net, Anthony. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, you've got to learn.  You've got to learn how to bluff, I think.  Yeah, you know, some people think, ah, I've got a crappy hand, I'm just going to give  a try at a bluff.  It all depends on what the other people are doing, what position you are.  Do you even know about position?  Oh, and I'm not talking, you know, the usual dirty stuff we'd get into here.  Is it worth bluffing?  How are the other people betting to determine what you should do?  You could learn all this at bodog.net.  Right!  Then you're going to learn.  You're going to be able to go and play some poker, sit down with your friends, maybe play 
[03:07:30]  a live game, and they'll be like, hey, this guy was a sap a couple of weeks back.  What happened?  And you could tell him.  It was bodog.  That's where I learned how to play, and now I'm taking your money.  Sucker.  Will they teach me how to, like, handle, like, splits and double downs and stuff?  I don't know how to do any of that.  That's blackjack, you blithering fool.  That's why you need bodog.net.  Of course.  In poker, I yell, hit me.  And people do, with their fists right in your little face. 
[03:08:00]  And sexy-o, the same thing.  I don't know how to do that.  All right, it's bodog.net.  Right.  Bodog.net.  Exactly.  I was actually, honestly, not goofing off.  I just forgot what you were talking about, because I came back in and was trying to be helpful.  You weren't.  I'm sorry.  At all.  So is that dogbo.net?  Bodog.net.  Bodog.  Bodog.net.  Bodog.net.  Hey, it's Robert Patrick, everyone.  Robert.  Hey.  There he is.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Very well.  How are you?  Are you calling from L.A.?  I am calling from Hollywood Hills here. 
[03:08:30]  Wow.  Are you in L.A.?  I wish.  We're in New York City.  I go back and forth.  Huh?  How cold is it?  It's about 40 today.  It's all right.  It's about 40?  That's not bad.  We can handle that, you know.  Yeah.  Not too bad.  A little early over there.  Does a movie star like you get up this early usually, or what?  Man, I tell you, I was working last night on a new comedy that Steve Zahn's starring in,  that Adam Sandler's producing called Strange Wilderness. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah?  And I had to work until about 12, 30, 1 o'clock in the morning.  I got about two hours sleep, and I've been up doing this radio conversation.  Oh, wow.  Jesus Christ.  You're going to be in a comedy?  Yeah.  Can you believe that?  Now, that's a little different for you.  Yeah, it is.  It's a real stretch.  And they hired me, basically, to come in and be a hard ass and, you know, keep a straight  face.  And I tell a story, I don't want to get into it.  It's quite a detailed story, a monologue, that hopefully is going to bring down the house. 
[03:09:30]  It says here, Robert, that you were in the faculty?  Yes, sir.  I remember that one, yeah.  I played the high school football coach.  Mm-hmm.  You got that scary voice, Robert.  He always plays a badass, man.  Yeah, of course.  Always, and of course, the ultimate badass, Terminator 2.  Are you sick of talking about the Terminator?  Never, never sick of talking about the Terminator.  Liquid Metal Man, Liquid Metal Man gave me my career.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He didn't play a badass in Lonely Street with Jay Moore.  Jay Moore is sitting here with us, by the way. 
[03:10:00]  Jay Moore is sitting there with you?  No.  Is that what you just said?  No, we're just kidding.  What do you think of Jay Moore?  I like Jay Moore.  He's a funny guy.  You remember him when he was on Saturday Night Live, don't you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's hilarious.  Yeah, you did a...  Lonely Street's a project, actually, that Jay and I are...  Yeah, what did he do for SNL there, Robert?  I'm trying to remember.  What was that?  What did Jay Moore do on SNL?  I'm trying to remember now.  Wave goodbye.  No, there was that one thing he did, Robert. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, it was a character.  What the hell was it?  Jesus, if I can only remember.  He did a great Christopher Walken.  Oh, he did an amazing Christopher Walken.  There you go.  I saw him do Rickles.  How about Rickles?  You know, cowbells are funny.  There you go.  The cowbell best.  Ape suits are funny.  Ape suits as well.  Yeah, ape suits as well.  You heard that story too, didn't you?  Ape suits.  What's the ape suit story?  You don't know that story?  Very funny.  No, what's that story about?  Well, you tell it.  Actually, Robert, we do have Jay Moore in the studio. 
[03:11:00]  Is that you?  Yeah, we were waiting for you to say something bad about me.  Yeah, we were trying to hire somebody else to play over us.  Are you kidding me?  What's going on, Jay?  How you doing, baby?  No, that's not Jay.  We're completely fucked up.  I'm like totally lost.  I can't see you guys.  Our kids go to the same school, the country school.  What?  Yeah, Jay.  I saw you last time out on the country school, baby.  How's your kid?  He's good.  You know, Gary Oldman's kids go to the school too.  Really?  I wait outside like a fucking school girl.  Jay, but really lay the bomb. 
[03:11:30]  Whose kid, well, you know, whose kid goes there?  What do you mean?  Do you know Gary Oldman?  Yeah, well, besides Gary Oldman, there's another Pixar whose kids go there.  Pacino?  Do you know?  Pacino.  Pacino, baby, yeah.  Yeah, the twins.  Pacino.  Did you ever see him out there?  Yeah, I have, and he's actually a really great dad.  He's a good guy, but I'm telling you, fucking, when I bump into Gary Oldman, I can't talk.  I'm like, hi.  Really?  I would just do Oswald lines to him.  That's all I would do. 
[03:12:00]  I would just do, that's all I would do is Oswald.  Let's hear something.  Hey, Jay.  I'm a patsy.  It's so great to hear your voice, man.  Now I'm really recognizing it.  Yeah, now, Jay's here.  He's a good friend of the show there, Robert.  RP's a good man.  RP's a good man.  And Robert, uh...  We did a little project called Lonely Street, where I want to play the old Elvis Presley  in his late 60s.  Yeah, that's the latest movie that's coming out?  Well, no, we're trying to make it.  We need a million dollars, but the Jews that control Hollywood won't give Corp up the cash.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, that'll really get him going.  Don't say that, Robert Patrick.  It wasn't Robert Patrick talking.  Oh, sure.  It was Jim Norton, sure.  Robert, I have a question.  I'm an actor as well, and I've been doing a little acting, and what's some advice you  could give me as an actor?  Coffee, please.  Well, you know, my advice that I usually give people that ask me for advice is don't ask  me for advice.  But I need help.  What's the worst mistake you see actors making?  Uh, coming into Hollywood and, uh...  Working with Eddie Murphy.  I'm acting class.  It's not really an acting class. 
[03:13:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  Does that make any sense at all?  Yeah, because those who can do, those who can't teach.  Jay, what are you doing in New York City, baby?  These are my guys.  These are my buddies.  These are my friends.  We're having a good time.  We're fucking around.  It's innocent.  Jay comes in.  We hang out.  We've got to get the kids over to country school here, bud.  Robert, Jay's in town to do the NASCAR thing.  NASCAR Awards.  I'm hosting the NASCAR Awards, and I'm going to see Jeff Ross at Caroline's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we've got Jeffrey Ross in the studio, a very funny comedian that's playing Caroline's.  Robert, you don't remember, but we worked together on... 
[03:13:30]  On the faculty, I played Coach Joe Willis.  Coach Joe Willis?  Were you in the faculty also?  No, he played Coach Joe Willis.  Do you remember Jeff Ross?  You actually worked with him?  Number 37.  On the cool surface, he played Jarvis Scott.  Look at number 37 on the credits here for Robert Patrick.  Hacks.  You know who was in that movie?  Huh?  Terry Hatcher.  Yeah?  I heard she's a big coke whore that'll fuck anything these days.  I like her.  Jesus. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, let's get into some Hollywood rumors.  Come on.  Wow.  Let's go.  No, Terry Hatcher's a fucking coke mess.  I heard she uses David Spade as a dildo.  Oh, my God.  Robert Patrick.  Turn it up in front of the school, will you?  Yeah, satellite radio.  We can get away with a lot more.  Hey, Robert.  The blacks don't tip.  They don't.  Comment, Robert?  Yeah.  Yeah, Robert's not going to comment on the likes of that.  Where are you right now, Robert? 
[03:14:30]  He's in the Hollywood Hills.  I'm sitting here in the Hollywood Hills, Jay Moore.  That's where I live.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  When you were doing Terminator 2.  Yes.  A friend of mine wanted me to ask you this.  Like, did you find that, like, doing all that running, was that like, when you originally  took the role, did you kind of know that it was going to be like, like, you know what  I'm saying?  Oh, yeah.  Like what?  You can't fuck with R.P.  No, no, no, no.  But, I mean, did you know it was going to be all that physical stuff?  Did I know?  Oh, yeah, absolutely. 
[03:15:00]  In all seriousness, and I'm a very sincere guy.  The whole parameters of that was laid out.  You're going to have to be in great shape.  You're going to be going up against Arnold.  You're going to be doing a lot of running.  We're going to be doing all this, you know, prosthetic pieces.  You're going to have to be in great shape.  And they really put me through a training program.  How did you audition for that?  Because there was, like, very little dialogue.  Very little dialogue at all.  I think I had, like, 15 lines.  You go in, and they basically, they didn't let me read the script, but they said, you've 
[03:15:30]  got to create this intense presence, and it was total ad-lib.  I can't even think of what I want to say here, but I was making everything up as I was going  to improv, and I went from that and just sort of created what you see, and my instincts  happened to be right, and I got the role.  Yeah, you didn't even have to talk.  Just a turn of the head, a look, and stuff.  It was really menacing.  It was a complete lack of mercy in that look.  It really was fantastic.  You were in Rosewood.  It was pretty cool. 
[03:16:00]  Wasn't Rosewood a black film?  Rosewood is a black film, yes, sir.  And you played Fanny's Lover?  I was Fanny's Lover.  What do you guys got?  My IMDb report?  Yes.  Of course.  I loved Rosewood.  No, we did a lot of research.  That was a good movie, Rosewood.  Hey, Rosewood is a true story.  It was a John Singleton movie, and I had a lot of fun doing that because it involved  the Masons and all the Secret Society.  I know why you liked that movie.  You got to have sex with a negress. 
[03:16:30]  Actually, it was a white girl.  A rat?  Yeah.  It was a white girl, and she blamed a black woman.  You almost said something bad.  Yeah, kid.  No.  You totally did, son.  And then Copland, I just saw that the other day, where you get your dart in the nose.  Yeah, Ray Liotta.  You played quite the prick in that one.  That really is a great movie, though.  What are you promoting now, RP?  Well, buddy, I'm talking about Walk the Line. 
[03:17:00]  Walk the Line.  Come on.  You played Walk the Line?  There's a movie that I might have a little bit of buzz behind it.  Jesus.  Yeah, Walk the Line.  I'm playing, I'm Joaquin Phoenix's, well, I'm Joaquin Phoenix's dad.  I'm Johnny Cash's dad being played by Joaquin Phoenix, and I'm this pretty hard dude.  Ray Cash, his dad was a pretty tough guy.  Yeah?  And by tough guy, you mean like kind of an asshole dad?  Well, he was a hard man.  That's about the best way to describe it.  He's not warm and fuzzy like we are over at the country school. 
[03:17:30]  No.  At the country school.  Hey, wow.  I love his voice.  When you see Al Pacino, did you ever get a picture with him?  Well, you know, Jay, he's been up to my house here with the kids.  Up to the house.  Up to the house, Jimmy.  It's really cool.  I worked with Pacino on that.  One day you're hanging out, and you're going, like, Jesus, I got Al Pacino up there.  This isn't you, Jimmy.  This is Robert Patrick.  I worked with Pacino on that piece of shit, Simone, and he was like the sweetest guy in  the world.  So sweet.  Hey, Robert.  He told me, hey, RP.  Yes.  Pacino told me him, he was fascinated by comics, and he wanted to ask me comedy questions, 
[03:18:00]  and he said him and his brothers, when he was like 11 or 12, they did vaudeville, and  they used to do these sketches.  I'm going to, I'm going to, last night I was working, I'm doing this comedy, Strange  Wilderness, with Steve Zahn.  That is the funniest fucking script I ever read with Fred Wolfe.  And I, yeah, and I'm playing, I'm playing Gus Hayden, the guy that has his throat cut  by the Aloha Pygmies, and they run away.  The testicles unraveled down to the ground, he scoops them back up out of the dirt, and 
[03:18:30]  he shoves them back into his sack, and he sews it shut himself.  I wanted Steve Zahn's part so bad.  You wanted to do that.  Well, guess what?  We were talking about you last night, I'm not kidding you, and Fred goes, Fred goes,  he was having a conversation with Chris Walken, and Chris Walken said, I want Jay Moore on  the show, because he does me.  Yeah, he was on SNL.  He said, well, we can't get, Jay Moore's not on the show right now.  He left the show, and Fred said, Chris went, yeah, but Jay Moore, get him. 
[03:19:00]  I want him.  No, he said, he can do me.  I want that boy that does me.  Yeah, I want that boy.  He doesn't work here anymore, Chris.  Yeah, but you should get that boy.  Fred said that he asked for you like three or four times.  He kept saying, Jay's not doing the show anymore, and Chris finally went, there's planes.  There's planes.  There's planes.  That's my punchline.  No, we like that.  We're all laughing, but I spilled coffee.  Wait, can we have a tissue in here, because Jay just spilled a coffee on a million dollars 
[03:19:30]  of equipment.  Yeah, we could go off the air at any second, because of the Starbucks coffee that's on the  console.  So Pacino likes comedians?  Hey, RP.  That's a classic Starbucks.  I'm going to start calling him RP, Anthony.  What the hell?  RP, I like that.  He likes RP.  Hey, RP.  Chappy calls him RP.  I've got to tell you something, Anthony and I hung with your brother there at one of the  rock festivals in Boston.  Is this Opie?  Yes.  Opie talking.  You and Anthony hung with my brother?  Oh, yeah.  Richard, man.  He is the coolest dude.  Holy crap.  We had a lot of fun with him.  He played for Nine Inch Nails.  He played with Nine Inch Nails.  He did the lead singing for Filter. 
[03:20:00]  Now he's working with the boys from STP, right?  Yeah, and last night, he came and visited me last night on the set, and he brought the  new CD.  It's not, it hasn't been mixed yet.  He's going into the final mixing, but it was produced by Bob Ezra, and it rocks, man.  It's, it's, it's, I don't know how to do it.  RP, I had no idea your brother was in Filter.  Richard Patrick, man.  Yes.  Hey, is your brother the guy that sings, did you think it'd get so cold?  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah.  And hey, man.  Watch your back, I got back. 
[03:20:30]  Great.  And live, man.  His voice live was just as good as, uh.  On, on any, any record, man.  Anything about your mother.  That sounds great.  Hey, man, nice shot.  Yep.  Hey, man, nice shot.  Hey, man, nice shot.  He has the other, uh, song, uh, Take a Picture.  Uh, Take a Picture is in a minute.  I still love that song.  Hey, uh, but, uh, Anthony and I were hanging with him.  He's a crazy fuck, man.  He was flying some, uh, those, uh, what are those planes called?  He was trying to talk us into buying one.  Cessna?  No, no.  The ones you, you put together in a box.  Like an ultralight or a.  Yeah, my brother's got a light. 
[03:21:00]  He's got a light.  He's a, he's a wild guy.  Yeah.  It was like a lawn chair that he, I souped up.  It was some crazy thing.  I'm like, what are you doing?  A lawn chair with helium balloons.  Something was going on with him.  Oh, God.  God only knows what he was into at the time.  How many years ago was that?  Because he was, he was kind of out there, you know?  Oh, that was, uh, yeah, like, uh, shit, eight years ago.  Yeah, he was offering, too.  Believe me.  He's coming back down to reality now.  Yeah.  Uh, he's great, man.  A continued success for your brother.  Hey, how did you feel when they offered you that X-Files role? 
[03:21:30]  Oh, that was, that was really, really exciting.  You know, you're lying, RP.  It was a fucking lose-lose.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, Jay.  No, me and RP are buddies.  I can say that to RP.  It's like if they offered you NYPD Blue now, it's like, well, great.  How many, come on, you had to know going in, like, the shelf life was ticking.  I liked the John Doggett years.  No, no, no, absolutely.  I was really, really excited when they offered me the role.  I really wanted to get back into television.  And, uh, I wanted money for a house.  And I had to get into television because I hadn't really done anything except for the 
[03:22:00]  Sopranos.  And then I, I was really busted up that it only lasted two seasons.  I enjoyed very much, uh, going to work every day.  I liked that sort of, uh, factory lifestyle.  You know, you knew where you were going to be for the next year.  Yeah.  You know, as you kicked around out here in Hollywood, you're kind of trying to find  something stable.  And then you want to do a TV show because you want to buy a house for your kids.  Exactly.  And now I'm doing this new David Mamet show that's, uh...  Love Mamet.  Are you, wait, is that the Gepin Playhouse?  Uh, is that the what?  What's the Mamet show? 
[03:22:30]  No, David Mamet, he's got a brand new show that's on television.  Yeah.  Are you serious?  Yeah, it's going on CBS in March.  I'm doing it right now.  He's a working son of a bitch, man.  When you see me out there on the schoolyard, I got the buzz cut going right now.  RP, I will say this.  At the pancake breakfast, you were sitting at the table of the hottest fucking moms.  It was RP and, like, nine fucking, like, porno hot moms.  Pancake breakfast?  You never miss a pancake breakfast, baby.  No, it was good.  Is that what goes on at the country school? 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, when you sit next to fucking Gary Oldman's cleaning plates.  Like, literally, he goes, uh, well, I haven't met all of you.  That's what he said.  And my fucking nanny goes, yes, I know him.  Yeah.  RP, this is what you must know.  These are...  That's how we raise the money, with the pancakes, baby.  Fuck, please, fucking 12 grand from preschool.  That cocksucker asked me for money.  Fuck Paul Singer.  He's like, yeah, if you want to host a thing, fuck you, 12 grand.  My kid fucking plays with trucks and shits his pants. 
[03:23:30]  And you got 12 grand off me, you fucking animal.  Go fucking hit up somebody else with that bake sale.  I have a bake sale, you fucking kook.  It's fucking preschool.  I say to my son, how was school?  He goes, good.  I rode bikes.  12 grand to ride a fucking bike and take a nap.  Jackson.  Oh, my God.  Good kid.  12 grand.  That's unbelievable.  Listen, RP, there's something you must know.  Yes.  These guys, Opie and Anthony, this is the show for all time for you. 
[03:24:00]  This is your go-to show.  I would love to have.  I will go to this show now that I'm aware of it, and I've really enjoyed it.  I'll be definitely going to this show.  I'd love to have RP as a pal.  You got the XM?  I'm a little behind.  I'm in the Stone Age here.  I'm still playing 8-tracks.  Get RP a radio.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  RP gets a radio.  I love that you guys are calling him RP.  That's it.  We go way back with RP. 
[03:24:30]  At least 20 minutes.  Now we do.  I like the RP.  I'll take a radio while you're giving them out.  You want one, too?  Yeah.  Hey, do you live near Los Feliz, RP?  Sort of, yeah.  It's not RP.  I'm up here in the hills.  Where are you?  I'm on Torrico.  I'm not actually going to give out my...  No, no, no.  But in relationship to the Hollywood Bowl, are you on that side of the freeway or on the  city walk side?  I'm on the Hollywood Boulevard side of the mountains here.  Oh, I'm on the city walk side.  Oh, very good.  I'm going to adopt a kid just so I can enroll him in this country school and hang out with 
[03:25:00]  a pancake breakfast.  You can't get in.  Why can't I get in?  Because I walked in with Nikki Cox and her stepdaughter, who's a fucking graduate, and  then I'm famous, and we went right in with...  Is it hard to get in?  How many kids?  How many kids?  You've got to be on Upity Up.  You've got to be on...  What if I say I know RP?  That would help.  You'd have more...  You vouch?  If you knew Jay.  You vouch for me?  Both of you guys?  I'd adopt a little Korean kid or something?  No, if you adopt a base-stealing Dominican, I'd vouch for you, not some fucking slope.  I'm not going to fucking endorse some stupid slope. 
[03:25:30]  Some fucking slope, which you're trying to help the world over here, and you're fucking  me up.  No, I'm just tired of the fucking kids with the slope, the slope fucking...  Oh, West Coast.  Okay.  And they've got the t-shirt.  All right.  This is Scott Moms.  See?  We're...  Fucking tight couple.  We're on the East Coast.  We're sick of the Dominicans.  Get a fucking Dominican.  It's like having the Mets.  We need an exchange program on the coast.  Because you have all Asians out there, and we have all Dominicans over here.  RP, I'm walking in Huntington Beach, where I rent a lovely house, and I'm jogging along  the beach, and it's just all fucking Chinese people walking around, and it's like, you 
[03:26:00]  know, it's 75 degrees.  They're wearing long-sleeved white shirts.  And they got their umbrellas.  And they're fucking like poker visors.  I'm like, well, thanks for fucking buying the real estate.  I've been looking for two years, you fucking slope.  Jeez.  Jay.  Oh, fuck you.  You giddy cock.  Fuck them all.  Well, RP needs to know how good this show is.  The Asians get slow.  And this just in.  Jeffrey Ross and Robert get XM radios.  Yes, absolutely. 
[03:26:30]  Ben's going to send them out today.  You've got to check out the XM.  I'm telling you, Robert.  RP, check out opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com, and check out the photoshops.  We don't say it.  What?  You were about to tell them your website.  I was not.  Yeah, absolutely.  Don't confuse this issue.  You called him RP.  This is our own RP.  You've got to get Robert out of here.  Sorry.  Ah, there we go.  Can he say goodbye, though?  Hey, can I say goodbye to you guys?  Yeah.  Please.  I'll see Anthony and my buddy Jay Moore.  RP!  Everyone go out and see Walk the Line. 
[03:27:00]  Everyone is calling in right now saying you were great in the movie there, Robert.  Ah, well, that's great to hear.  Maybe Jay will go see it.  And tell Rick, what are you going to go to next?  Shuckles, fuckles, and cuckoo in Tampa?  We're going to do some bullshit radio show, and it's going to be a complete letdown after  you get to say Slope and Cocksucker?  Say Cocksucker on the radio while you can.  Say hello to Chappie for me.  Hey, real fast, Robert.  Get Richard to call our show.  Hey, pardon me?  Say that again.  Get your brother to call our show someday. 
[03:27:30]  I'll get Richard to call you very, very soon.  All right, thank you, Robert.  Thank you, RP.  It's RP, everyone.  Country school, Robert Patrick.  Thank you, guys.  See you, man.  There he goes.  I think we made a new friend.  How cool is that?  Thanks to Jay Moore, actually.  That guy is the shit.  Yeah.  He's a good dude, man.  And he looks like he does in Copland.  He's got, like, the fucking, what, Kerry Collins had the state trooper mustache?  Yeah.  He's got that mustache.  The cop mustache.  And he's got, like, the jeans with, like, the wallet and the chain.  He's a badass-looking dude.  He's just cleaning plates at the pancake breakfast. 
[03:28:00]  It's me.  Like, I'm the lowest guy in the totem pole.  Like, I'm so far now.  Like, I might as well just be, like, a fucking civilian.  Did you talk to Gary Oldman?  Yeah.  And I'm, like, an obsessive schoolgirl.  Because we have the same divorce lawyer.  All right.  And I go, ah, you know, we'll get the same lawyer.  He goes, oh, well, I haven't met all of them.  Oh, he's got a team?  And his kids come up to me and go, you're an actor!  You're in polio!  And I go, no, he's an actor.  I'm an entertainer.  Who's your dad?  He's, you know, he's been in a couple of movies. 
[03:28:30]  He's the coolest guy.  All you should say to him is, I'm a patsy.  Just do Oswald lines.  Nothing but Oswald.  No, you don't do that.  Yes, you do.  Look like an idiot.  Why?  He played a great Oswald.  We're going to do a quick break.  We have to get our Jeffrey Ross plug-in.  He's playing Caroline.  He's a very funny comedian.  Am I still here?  Ah, yes.  Tonight through Sunday.  Caroline's here in New York City.  Is there some black guy doing the late show again?  I am not resisting.  I am not resisting arrest.  I am a patsy.  Sounds just like him, actually.  He hasn't made one movie his kids would know. 
[03:29:00]  At least you've been in movies his kids would know, Jay.  That's cool.  Yeah, but.  All right.  We're going to break.  Is there a black person coming in at one to do a late show at Caroline's?  At Caroline's?  Mooney?  I don't know.  My shows are on the early shows.  Where Paul Mooney sits there for three hours, makes fun of white people, then he goes home  to his white wife and he's gay?  He has a white wife and he's gay?  And he's a fucking homo.  Why does he have a wife at all?  Because he's a fucking racist cocksucker.  Jesus.  Why is that a Jesus?  Paul Mooney is the most racist fucking.  He just said he has a white wife and he's gay. 
[03:29:30]  Yes.  But he's a racist.  That's a lot.  That's a lot just to throw away in a sentence.  Yeah.  There's a lot of.  You don't think too much of a digest there, right?  Jeff.  Yeah.  You're going to look me in the eye and tell me you don't think Paul Mooney is a racist.  The last time I looked you in the eye, I kissed you, so I'm afraid.  Jay.  You don't think Paul Mooney's a racist.  He is, but.  When I say, I want you to know, when I go, Jesus.  Jesus, it means I agree with you wholeheartedly, but I just say it like in that way.  So that he doesn't get in trouble.  So as to keep things, you know.  Last time I was on this show, I got hate mail to a website that wasn't even up yet. 
[03:30:00]  What?  Your fans are psycho.  They're called past for a reason, Jeffrey.  I got mailed to an under construction website saying that I can't wait till a racist, hateful,  killer, shitty, weird.  Yeah, we kind of went off on something last time.  Yeah.  Paul Mooney's one of those racist Olsen twins.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And it doesn't know.  Oh, it was the racist Olsen twin chicks that we were talking about.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I heard you on that.  Those chicks are little hotties.  They were so cute.  The little Prussian blue girls.  They're adorable. 
[03:30:30]  And someone on Whackbag had them like a little older in bikinis, and I put a load all over  their faces.  They age them with Photoshop.  Yeah.  I got an email from one of your fans saying, next time you go to Iraq, where we're protecting  Israel, I hope there's a bullet with your name on it.  It wouldn't be too soon and this and that.  That was me.  Oh.  Hey, where's my copy of your movie?  I can't picture an insurgent sitting there with one bullet just going.  Jeffrey, I'm dead serious.  I want to check the E.  Jeff Flurry.  The schnoz.  Is it an E before the R?  How do you spell? 
[03:31:00]  J-E.  Live short, sold, fit, and bullets.  I put a Ross.  Don't fucking fire me.  Be careful.  We didn't even talk about Gary Glitter today.  Who cares?  He's been doing the same thing for two years.  Vietnam faces death sentence.  This is getting crazy for Gary Glitter.  Faces the death sentence for rape.  He's in trouble, that guy.  He's in big trouble.  Underage, obviously.  How old is she?  12.  Yeah, 12.  12 years old.  That's not bad.  Look what she was wearing.  Is it real rape, though?  What's fake rape, Jimmy?  The thing was, did he rape her, or was it a statutory thing? 
[03:31:30]  Like, was it an actual physical assault?  I don't know.  And at a 12 years old, I don't think there's much distinction there.  I'm just curious.  Come on, they're six years old, though, and you want yum-yum.  At least he doubled the age.  Gary Glitter's what?  60?  61.  61.  Under investigation in Vietnam for allegedly raping kids.  Ronnie had a great point on Ron and Fez yesterday.  He was talking about this and said, the guy is 61 years old.  He can't get an 18-year-old and be satisfied with that?  Being 61 years old and grab a girl that's legal, 18, he's like, no, I need younger. 
[03:32:00]  He's a monster.  I need younger than 18.  He's a child molester.  He's a one-hit wonder.  Hey!  That's where the kids go when he puts it in their butts.  Hey!  Why you do that, Joe?  There they are.  Why you do that, Joe?  Jimmy, you're a clock watcher, I've noticed today.  I just want to know where we are, man.  You're a little clock watcher. 
[03:32:30]  I've noticed your big clock watcher.  And he was found guilty of storing more than 4,000 images of child pornography on his computer.  Oh, back in 1999.  I just got them in an email.  I didn't know I opened it.  What happened to Pete Townsend?  It was actually falling out of a hard drive.  Did you ever get found guilty or anything?  Yeah, he went a couple months in jail and that was it.  He said he was doing research.  He didn't do any jail time.  He didn't do any jail time.  He said that he was abused as a child and he was doing his own research on child pornography.  He cleared of all charges.  He was researching Pete Townsend's book. 
[03:33:00]  Yes.  How did he get rid of that fucking...  How does R. Kelly not have been in jail?  He's been pissing on chicks for 10 fucking years.  Yeah, allegedly underage, Tim.  He's got another hit out.  Allegedly what?  She's done video with her fucking ID.  I'm 14.  I can prove it.  She wasn't showing a geo card.  You gave me permission, you Jew motherfucker.  I can't go over my head again.  Don't start shitting your ass.  This is a nice fucking joint.  And the midget hater got some probation. 
[03:33:30]  Probation's all he got?  You haven't heard about this story?  What happened to Fat Nick?  Fat Nick, we didn't even get to today.  Is he even in the news?  Yeah.  Free Fat Nick.  Come on, free Fat Nick.  I'd do a benefit for him.  Well, let's explain the midget thing to Jay.  All right.  This guy lives next to midgets, Jay, right?  And he was friends with midgets.  Family.  A house of midgets?  A mother, a daughter.  A mother and a daughter.  Both freaky.  All right.  Just a disgraceful team.  Is it a regular-sized house, or is it dumbed down for the midgets?  A regular-sized house. 
[03:34:00]  He used to be friends with the mom and the daughter.  And then something happened, and he just didn't like him anymore.  Started doing the hate crime thing.  And he actually painted a yellow brick road, or a yellow stripe.  Yeah, he took yellow paint and painted it from their house out into the street.  But look at the name.  Look at the article title.  A Little Justice.  A Little Justice.  Mental Midget Guilty.  Mental Midgets Guilty.  I love the post so much.  Pleaded guilty to a felony hate crime and must successfully complete an anger management program or face up to three years in prison. 
[03:34:30]  He admitted that in April, he spray-painted a yellow line up the sidewalk to Shay's house.  When Shay and 3'6'' daughter, Concilian, came out the door, he shouted,  Follow the yellow brick road.  What's wrong with that?  I know.  How did the relationship turn?  They don't explain that.  He also pointed a finger at the mom there and called her a low-life N.  She was a low-life.  A low-life knitter.  She's a life, and it's low to the confidence.  Say it, O.B.  It's liberating.  They say it.  Patrice says it. 
[03:35:00]  Knitter.  What?  A low-life knitter.  Oh, wow.  Well, the knitter is part of the joke we did yesterday, so I was just kind of...  Why is she black?  I was in route.  I was just trying to tie in yesterday's show.  Is the midget black?  I was in route in route.  A little bit, a little bit.  A little bit black?  A little bit.  Because she's a midget.  Just enough.  All you whack-baggers dancing around with golfer this, golfer this, they're niggers.  Oh, my goodness, Jay.  A little golfer was something that old Jimmy Norton came up with on our first new show back,  I believe.  That's right.  Was it?  Yes.  And it was amusing. 
[03:35:30]  You can find a history of that on MySpace slash Anthony Cumia.  You can't.  That side's been taken down.  No.  Because Gary Glitter goes there.  Gary Glitter's a childfucker, Anthony.  I'm not.  Anthony getting lots and lots of new friends from MySpace.  I need new friends.  Hey, T-Bagger from Florida.  T-Bagger.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  Happy birthday there, Donut Tits.  Thank you.  Listen, I've got to call you out as much as I love you.  At least Jay would have shown that chick in D.C. his cock.  True.  Jay would have shown her and her kids his cock, along with Hugh Pinero and Eric Logan. 
[03:36:00]  Anyone with eyes, Jay will show his cock to.  How do I get in touch with his Eric Logan?  I need a little XM show, maybe.  A little sports radio.  I think if you would have been nice to Jay, he probably, after he corn-holed her, he would  have let you lick the shit off of it.  Okay.  That doesn't sound like fun at all.  Well, you took it a little too far, sir.  Yeah, sir.  You went a little bit too far.  You're mean-spirited.  Alex in Minnesota.  Alex.  Morning, gang.  Good morning.  The show is electric with Jay and little Jimmy in studio today. 
[03:36:30]  What about Jeffrey Ross?  No, I don't like him.  Well, he's not screwing it up.  I'll give him that.  Jay, I just finished a piece of literary genius called Gasping for Airtime This Week.  It's a good book.  It's a bestseller.  It is.  I like this.  It's a great book.  You wrote my favorite SNL bit of all fucking time.  Thanks.  Charles Barkley versus Barney.  Did you go to SI.com and check out my Michael Irvin column? 
[03:37:00]  Not yet.  You'll like it.  I'm in my car on the road, actually.  I definitely will.  My favorite was the sportscaster, actually, where you would play the clips backwards.  Rob Schneider wrote that for himself.  And be amazed at what the guys were doing.  Rob Schneider wrote that for himself, didn't want to do it, and gave it to me.  Really?  Wow.  Gold.  Hey, put a 10 on that circus.  They're upside down.  The Scotty Pittman takes a shot, and the ball freezes in midair. 
[03:37:30]  Let's go to Chuck in Texas.  Chuck.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Chuck.  Hold on.  Right now, Fan is being humiliated.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, as we speak.  Mr. Tomlinson.  Let's get him on the phone and see how his audition's going.  Hey, Chuck, go ahead.  Yeah, what's up with Jimmy Norton?  He's a racist Jew.  Me?  What?  He looks like a Jew.  Yeah, he's been dropping Knitter off for the last two days.  He's racist, but not a Jew.  Jimmy?  He's a wannabe Jew.  He's a wannabe self-being Jew.  What are you talking about, sir? 
[03:38:00]  I don't know.  He's a wannabe racist Jew.  He's been dropping racist comments.  The Knitter thing, he's been all over it.  It's really starting to bother me.  What's racist about saying Knitter?  First of all, everyone's been saying Knitter, and we say it in joke form, so what's your  problem with it?  And I'm not Jewish.  I don't know what's your problem with Anthony and Opie.  Jimmy, he's going too far with it.  All right.  So do you just want me to yell at you?  My throat hurts from doing Ramone.  I'm too tired to yell.  Ramone!  He lost his voice doing Ramone today.  You have a pair of jeans up on eBay. 
[03:38:30]  I just got an XM radio, man.  It's just for you.  All from the hemop...  Oh, it's for hemophilia.  National Hemophilia Association.  Cox has a pair up, too.  And they're signed...  God bless.  God bless.  Hey, guys.  Say more.  Some last-minute advice to Than.  He's sitting there, waiting to audition.  Than?  Spirit Than.  Yes.  Oh, jeez.  I see a lot of calls coming out with my name on it.  You're not calling.  That's all I know.  Than?  No, we need more NASCAR jokes.  No, it says Jeff Ross is really funny. 
[03:39:00]  Jeff Ross is fucking hysterical.  When's Jeff's movie out on DVD?  Get around here.  Jeff and Jay are two of my favorite comedians.  Than?  Go to jeffreyrosshomemovie.com for info about that DVD.  All right, Than?  Are you trying to get me?  No, Than.  We really want to know, how is the audition going?  It hasn't gone yet.  I'm sitting outside waiting in my suit.  You're ashamed and nervous in that waiting room.  How many people are in the waiting room?  It's just me and another guy. 
[03:39:30]  What does he look like?  Down and a wire.  He's strapping.  Punch him in the face.  Put him on the phone.  He's not here.  Just walk away.  You fucking liar.  Did they cast the third guy already?  No, I think they're doing a lot of it in L.A.  You're going on tape for a one line in a commercial?  What are you going to fly out to L.A. for one line?

[03:40:00]  That's a huge, uh...  Jimmy, you've changed.  I know.  It's very bitter.  All right, Dan.  Good luck to you.  People bringing up the heavy metal singer turned real estate agent.  All right!  John in Florida.  I got a nice three-minute play.  Hey, you had a couple of very funny characters.  I was all right with my dad.  Oh, boy.  There's the end of show music.  John in Florida.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, is Jeff still there?  Yes.  No, man.  Jeff was in one of the funniest freaking comedy specials I've ever seen in my life, 
[03:40:30]  and I wanted to see if I could get a hold of it somewhere.  It was the Shaq's All-Star Comedy Roast of Emmett Smith.  Available on DVD.  Yep.  You can buy it in the store.  Or you can get it on MySpace, splash, slash Jim Norton.  Splash.  Splash.  Yeah, type in splash.  Oh, slash.  Silly ass head.  It's a slash.  All right, John.  Thanks.  Hey, we're running out of show.  I want to thank Jay Moore for stopping by.  He's doing the NASCAR thing.  The awards.  He doesn't know when.  Don't plug anything for me.  All right, and Jeffrey Ross at Caroline's all weekend long. 
[03:41:00]  Tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony program, the eggnog.  Mitters.  See you tomorrow.  Thanks, Jeffrey.  Program complete. </pre>
