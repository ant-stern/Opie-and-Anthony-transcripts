<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a self-congratulatory introduction, boasting its controversial nature and refusal to be "nice."  This segued into a rambling, offensive diatribe, including a bizarre hypothetical about suicide bombers and insults aimed at an unnamed person, followed by a satirical song about Hillary Clinton.  Jimmy Norton's morning woes – a stuck jacket zipper and lack of cab fare – provided further comedic fodder.  Norton then joined the studio, recounting his difficult morning.  The hosts played a listener voicemail deemed "horrible" by Kenny, and promoted an animation contest with a $2,000 prize, mentioning a humorous submission featuring puppet versions of themselves with new names. Anthony’s new facial hair became a topic of extensive discussion, compared to various styles and celebrities.  The conversation veered into a discussion of Anthony's personal items (razor, nail clippers, "guns"), and his pet, Jack-Jack.  Upcoming guests Dave Rabbits and Mike Birbiglia were mentioned, along with a brief discussion of the Texas primary.

A news story about pilots falling asleep during a flight prompted a comedic skit.  The show then heavily featured Dave Rabbit, playing numerous audio clips from his irreverent and often offensive underground radio show from Vietnam, broadcast, as described, from a whorehouse. The clips included announcements, jingles, and humorous bits, notably a sanitation department plea about not flushing toothpicks down the toilet.

The broadcast then shifted to a story about a truck carrying chickens overturning in New York City, prompting comedic descriptions of the chickens’ apparent lack of self-preservation. This segued into an ironic celebration of Black History Month by acknowledging Ernie Hudson's role in *Ghostbusters*. Further promotion of upcoming segments and listener interaction concluded this section.

A separate segment opened with Opie lamenting missing soap and nail clippers. This transitioned into a discussion of a YouTube video showing a white man assaulted by black men, and the perceived disparity in media coverage compared to a noose found in Columbia, sparking a debate on racial bias in media reporting.

Further discussion of Dave Rabbit involved playing more audio clips from his Vietnam show, showcasing its irreverent, crude, and humorous content focusing on drugs, sex, and life in Vietnam.  The segment also included mention of E-Rock, a show contributor known for witnessing gruesome accidents, and pictures of a car on its side.  An “Oscar Moments” segment from *Atonement* was included, followed by audio of Jim Norton vomiting. A young boy's angry MySpace rant, provided by studio guest Danny, was also played.  Dave Rabbit himself then called in, explaining the origins of his show following his roommate's death in a rocket attack, its broadcast from a whorehouse, its 21-day run due to military intervention, and its unexpected later popularity via the internet.

Another segment featured a detailed interview with Dave Rabbit, revealing the show's clandestine nature and tacit support from some military police and OSI, until higher-ups forced its closure.  He explained his 37-year secrecy, citing family safety and preserving the show's mystique. He mentioned remastered recordings on his podcast website, DaveRabbit.podomatic.com, featuring conspiracy theories and UFOs, and contrasted his show with Art Bell's, highlighting its humorous tone.  The interview concluded with a humorous outro.

The hosts then discussed the upcoming Clinton-Obama debate, a video mocking Obama’s appeal to black voters ("No Country for White Men"), a woman stabbing a man who called her ugly, and a man-on-the-street segment mocking interviewees’ comments about a naked man at a Dunkin' Donuts.  This was followed by off-color jokes, promotion of "Semi-Pro," and a discussion on unnecessarily long songs by artists like Yes, Jethro Tull, and the Allman Brothers Band.  Mike Birbiglia's presence as a guest was mentioned, though he wasn't featured in this segment.  The hosts promised to play the full, uncensored Dave Rabbit tape the next day.

A later segment featured Mike Birbiglia as a studio guest. He started with a gang-related joke about Los Angeles, followed by a long segment of his stand-up routine, "In A Guy DeVita."  He recounted disappointing experiences at celebrity events, including a golf tournament and a charity event where his performance was poorly attended.  The hosts discussed the challenges of stand-up comedy and delayed feedback from message boards. A phone call with radio personality and pilot Lee Abrams followed.  Abrams’ knowledge of Dave Rabbit was noted, leading to a lengthy discussion about Yes, their discography, and unnecessarily long songs, with many digressions.  Birbiglia then described his sleepwalking disorder and related incidents, including jumping from a hotel window.  The segment concluded with promotion of Birbiglia's shows and the playing of a Killers song featuring Lou Reed.

A final segment featured more discussion of Birbiglia’s sleepwalking, including an anecdote about requesting first-floor hotel rooms due to fire-related anxieties.  Extended riffing on chickens and a vulgar, highly critical segment on their driver, Kenny, were included.  John McCain's alleged affair was briefly discussed, along with more excerpts from Dave Rabbit’s tape.  Finally, Jimmy self-promoted his Albany show with significant vulgarity, frequently insulting the city and its residents.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock, Josh, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shotguns, Opie and Anthony.  Shotguns, Opie and Anthony.  Shotguns, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shotguns, Opie and Anthony.  Shotguns, Opie and Anthony.  Two mentally retarded women strapped with remote control explosives where we use as unwitting suicide bombers.  Run! It is Pete Rose!  This is where entertainment is going.  You're a drunken pig and you're not sexy.  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver that isn't you. 
[00:01:00]  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver when you're sober.  They are sick freaks!  What is the biggest piece of s*** you're involved with?  I think that's the way to go with this interview, I'm thinking.  This show.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  One, two, three, four, five.  Oh.  Johnson, Ohio, Texas, and on to Penn State. 
[00:01:30]  She's gonna do it.  Give her just a chance, she'll make it.  Any class feeling, she'll break it.  She's gonna be your president.  President!  Hillary Clinton, nothing's gonna turn her back down.  A little sing-along to start the show today.  Get it on the track now.  With plans to make our dreams.  With plans to!  Yeah.  Hillary Clinton, there is nothing she can do. 
[00:02:00]  No.  Never heard the word impossible this time.  There's no time for chance.  She's gonna do it.  It's time for chance.  You use your tongue.  We are the know-how.  It's time.  It's time.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Stop whining. 
[00:02:30]  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  It's time.  For me and you.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  I had that dumb song in my head all night long.  Oh, horrid.  He's gonna do it!  And Jimmy's about to have a meltdown.  I'm trying to not make eye contact with him.  Jimmy's having a rough start. 
[00:03:00]  Oh my god.  He's still Jimmy.  Look at him.  He's been trying to take his coat off for the last 10 minutes.  You ever have the problem where your zipper doesn't work?  Yeah.  And it gets stuck and you can't get your coat off and you feel like you're six again?  What happens is it's gotten twisted up.  Yeah.  And the one on the left is a little longer than the one on the right, so it's bent.  Yeah.  When I try to put the little wrench in.  Yeah, you're done.  Yeah, you're...  Is the bottom unzipped too? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, of course it is.  Oh, no.  So now the zipper is just sitting there in the middle of his jacket.  It's unzipped on the bottom.  Oh god, Jimmy.  Now you're gonna choke yourself.  Choke yourself.  Now the zipper's way up near his neck.  And undone way below.  Hey, there you go.  Finally.  All right.  Jim Norton is joining the program.  Got out of his jacket.  It was like watching Houdini.  I'm thinking that you might have had a bad night, Jimmy.  Because all of a sudden, like just before 6 o'clock, we get a phone call that you're 
[00:04:00]  downstairs, you don't have cab money.  Then you come up here, you look miserable, your coat is stuck.  You just try to take your coat off for the last 10 minutes and you're just standing there  like defeated, it looks like.  Yeah, I'm just having a rough one.  I just ran out.  I forgot my cab money.  And I'm just sitting there.  And then Kenny's on it.  And Kenny always answers his phone.  Yeah.  Always.  Yeah.  But not when you're in a cab.  I'm glad that you called.  I'm sorry that I missed you.  He got his message. 
[00:04:30]  He got his message.  I hate Kenny's message.  It is the worst.  Thank you for calling.  I'll see if I can get his message because he doesn't say his number in it.  I'll see.  Oh, it is the worst.  There's nothing happy about his message.  No.  I know most of us just have very dull messages, but man.  Yeah.  Kenny takes the cake.  It's miserable.  If you could be Kenny's message, then I don't know.  Give us a call.  We'll play him today.  His horrible message.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jody in New Hampshire as Jimmy finds that. 
[00:05:00]  Jody, what's up?  What do you guys want to know?  Because I'll tell you.  Just so you stop playing that damn song.  We're going to do it.  Give her any chance to take it.  We're going to try to break it.  Yeah, well.  All right, Jody.  Thank you.  We're going back to Jimmy's phone.  I appreciate it.  This is what I had to hear.  Yeah, listen to this.  I'm happy that you called, and I'm sad that I missed you. 
[00:05:30]  Please leave a message.  Leave the message.  When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options.  Leave the message.  To leave a call.  All right.  Why are you alive?  That's great, man.  Absolutely great. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  We're getting started here.  Our phone number is 877-212-0&A.  I want to say good morning to Cleveland.  Good morning to Buffalo.  Good morning to Boston, of course.  Yes, of course.  Did we say good morning to Syracuse?  Even if we did, say it twice.  How about Grand Rapids?  How about...  Hi, Grand Rapids.  Bat-  Red stick.  Anyway.  There's a couple things going on.  Are you ready for the chicken story, or do you need a couple more minutes to calm down? 
[00:06:30]  A couple minutes.  Literally, I have no idea what you're talking about.  Are you all right?  No.  No.  What happened, Jimmy?  Do you want to share?  I'm very tired.  I've just argued with my girlfriend, and whatever.  I don't think this one's mutual.  Yeah.  We're going to have a good show, though, because I'm miserable, because I pulled out my stupid  back last night, working out.  I got like a hernia.  Working out?  What is that?  Oh, it's a plogem.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Why would I do it?  Eat truffles, fat boy.  Enjoy them.  Doing so good for so long. 
[00:07:00]  Have a truffle.  Have a truffle.  Treat yourself again.  Treat yourself to a truffle.  Treat yourself.  Would you like a truffle?  Yeah.  My inner voice is, would you like a truffle?  Yeah.  My inner voice goes, okay, you deserve it.  Yeah.  I hate the candy industry.  I really do.  It wasn't good enough to just have chocolate.  Now we have to have truffles.  Truffles.  They're so delicious.  They're just trying to shove as much fatness into a little square of chocolate as possible.  And they're delicious.  How do you say no to a truffle?  How do you say no to a truffle? 
[00:07:30]  You don't.  Would you like a truffle?  A truffle.  Do you like truffles?  I love truffles.  I got my girl a bunch of truffles knowing that she was probably going to eat two or three  and I need the rest of them.  And you could just eat the rest.  Yeah.  You never have one.  No.  They're just ridiculous.  Oh, what are you going to do?  It goes right to my thighs.  Yeah.  Um, we're going to promote it all morning, but, uh, we're doing this animation contest.  Where's the, where's the, where's the liner?  Let's go.  The liner. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you, sir.  Who are you?  Yeah.  Oh, hi, Travis.  That would be young Travis.  I gather.  What happened to Than?  Than is at a wedding.  Than's at a wedding.  Okay.  So we got this strange kid, Travis, filling in.  Uh, it's your last chance.  Uh, uh, see, Than, a very tall young man.  Yeah.  And I can see him.  Yeah.  Travis is very slight and he is invisible to me when he stands there.  I, there, see, that's like how tall he just stood. 
[00:08:30]  Would you stand on a chair?  Cause you're invisible to me.  Amazing.  Uh, yes.  Remove those cups and perhaps I can see you.  You need a booster seat.  You're like a little baby.  Um, well, we're doing a really cool contest.  I didn't think it was cool until I started checking out some of the, uh, some of the, uh,  uh, submissions.  Yes.  That are coming in.  Very funny.  It's your last chance to win $2,000.  Send us an original animated bit from our show. 
[00:09:00]  Uh, what you do is go to onaradio.com for all the details, courtesy of Be Kind Rewind,  starring Jack Black, you name it, we shoot it, in theaters tomorrow.  Yes.  And as I go to onaradio.com this morning, I'm seeing all those submissions and a lot  of them are really, really good, man.  Yeah.  Really, really good.  And then I go to YouTube.  I always throw Opie and Anthony into the search every morning to see what's popping  up.  See if we're in trouble.  And there's an animation that popped up.  I assume it's part of the contest.  It has to be. 
[00:09:30]  It's, uh, it's called ONA's New Names.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, very good animation.  It's us as like, like, uh, puppets.  Yeah, we're, we're like puppets on a little puppet stage.  Right, a little puppet stage.  And we're talking about our new names, which of course are Gregorio, Antonio, and  Yimmy, Yimmy, Yimmy.  And Yimmy is the star of this animation.  It is hilarious.  Can we play the, uh, the audio?  I think the audio would, uh, get the job done. 
[00:10:00]  How do we, uh, do that there, E-Rock?  You can't do it right from the internet, right?  Yeah, of course not.  Because that would, that would, whatever.  All right.  So, it's called, uh, ONA's New Names.  And it's up on, uh, YouTube right now.  And it's, it's hilarious.  And there's a bunch of other ones that are really, really good on onaradio.com.  So, make sure you get your animations in soon if you want to win $2,000.  And, uh, Jimmy, uh, you see Anthony?  He's, um.  I was sporting some, um.  Oh.  New, uh, facial hair. 
[00:10:30]  Wow, I didn't notice.  Sporting some new facial hair.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.  So, I figured it was, um, it was like funny facial hair day.  And Steve didn't appreciate that.  And had to be reminded, uh, because he said I was ripping him off.  And then Sam had to remind him that it's not ripping you off if you're making fun of him.  So, I went with the Steve.  Going with the Steve.  Well, it's a little bit.  Just a little.  It's a bit creepy because everyone has known you as, uh, Anthony with the goatee for as long as I... 
[00:11:00]  As long as we've been hanging out together.  And now you're doing like a mustache slash soul patch.  Yeah, soul patch.  You got the soul patch.  Soul patch.  I just, uh, got rid of the, um, the bottom of the goatee part.  That's it.  That's all I did.  Got rid of that.  And, uh, that's what we're looking at now.  That's going to go to.  The mustache should go to.  He just couldn't commit all the way.  I couldn't commit all the way.  You're right.  I have to, like, do this very slowly.  You look like the guy in Boogie Nights that was hanging out with, uh... 
[00:11:30]  Mark Wahlberg.  Come on, man.  Let's just rob him.  That was the look I was going for.  It's good to know you still have a razor in that mansion.  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I still got my razor.  Yep.  Nail clippers.  Yep.  Um, let me see.  That's my guns.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  That's pretty much it.  What?  That?  What about Jack-Jack?  Oh, Jack-Jack. 
[00:12:00]  You know, Stephen S. from Bayshore gave you Jack-Jack?  Yes.  Linger longer?  Little Jack-Jack.  How's Jack-Jack?  I don't know.  What?  I'm sure he's fine.  I'm sure he's fine.  So, um, if Clinton doesn't, uh, win Texas, this race is over.  Yes.  He's alive, though, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right, sure.  Being fed.  I gather. 
[00:12:30]  Awkward.  Yeah.  Being taken care of.  Sure.  Well, the new facial hair looks, uh, terrific.  Hey, thank you.  Are you feeling all right?  Yes.  Feeling good?  Actually, uh, yeah.  Okay.  Really good.  Are they liking the new facial hair on Pal Talk?  I don't know.  I'm hiding it with the microphone.  Why?  I can't see it.  Why?  I don't know.  Because people just want to make fun.  You're not ready to unveil the, uh, the new look for everybody? 
[00:13:00]  Here we go.  All right.  There you go.  Of course, the show's on Pal Talk every morning.  There's Anthony's new look.  The mustache and the soul patch.  Yeah, the mustache has to go.  Maybe keep the soul patch, though.  No, I don't just want the soul patch thingy.  That's a bit, that's a very popular look right now.  It's just a soul patch.  Uh, I kind of like the cop mustache.  You're not doing the cop mustache.  I want the cop mustache.  I want to go another guy's mustache, but he became very unpopular in the 30s and 40s. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, well.  It's so weird doing radio with Chef.  I'm a saucier.  Saucier.  Yes, of course.  Let's go to Shane and...  What?  You got change for an Obama.  Do I got change for an Obama?  What's that mean?  Yeah, I got to use the pay phone, dude.  You're a little worried about Obama becoming the next president of these United States?  No, man.  This is going to be on money.  It's going to be an Obama buck.  Do you think this is going to be an Obama buck?  An Obama dollar. 
[00:14:00]  Well, he's got to do his eight years first and do some amazing things, and then down the  road, maybe we'll get Obama bucks.  I'm telling you, you owe me five Obamas, dude.  Huh?  I don't know where he's going.  It's going to be like that.  It's going to be the next slang.  All right, Shane.  We're trying to go with your bit, but I don't get it.  Yeah, I don't get it.  We don't get why he's on money.  Help us out with your bit a little bit.  It's that when he does become president, he's going to be on money.  It's going to be called an Obama buck.  Like I said, help us out with the bed, man. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Here it is.  Ant Diggler.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  It's the evil ant from Star Trek.  The patches on the wrong lip.  I guess they want it under my nose.  Yeah, of course they do.  That was a real soul patch, wasn't it?  Yeah, well.  Frank Zappa.  Oh, you got a little Frank Zappa to you. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  A little bit.  Hopefully not just in the look, either.  Ant wants me to.  Oh, sorry.  I was reading.  I'm sorry.  We don't even know you're here yet, Jimmy.  I know.  It's all right.  But I swung in a mist so hard that the bat flew out of my hand.  Ended up down the first baseline.  Hit a little kid in the stands.  I expected a double off the wall, and the bat just flew out of my hand.  Well, it was a change-up.  You got tricked, you know.  You got tricked by the change-up.  So they're liking the mustache. 
[00:15:30]  Well, whatever you call that look.  I think of yours.  It makes me want to play White Room and drop some acid.  Nice.  I think he's going insane.  I think he's going insane.  No.  What?  No.  What are you saying no to?  I'm not going insane.  What are you talking about?  I didn't say anything.  I think I heard that.  Heard what?  That I was going insane.  Am I hearing voices?  Oh, Jesus.  Maybe I am.  And we have a good show today.  We got...  Yes, we do.  We got David...  Dave Rabbits.  Dave Rabbits on the phone at 8 o'clock. 
[00:16:00]  And later at 9.30, Mike Pribiglia.  And who's Rupert Bonham?  Survivor.  Oh, the Survivor.  Okay.  He's the tie-dye dude that was very popular.  Oh.  Also.  Survivor.  I don't know why we're talking to him, quite frankly.  All today on the Opie...  I mean, it would be terrific to talk to him later on this morning.  Let me finish.  Except promote you.  I think we keep saying today on the Opie and Goose Gossage Show.  Do you think I was really promoting our guest?  We were all to get to that.  I see you. 
[00:16:30]  You picked up your bet.  And you hit the ball that time.  I did.  It was a squibber that went through.  Goose Gossage.  Something's going on with him.  What?  I've known you for a while.  Something's going on with you.  You got tired of the goatee that happened?  Something's going on with you.  No.  I just thought because with Saturday...  Saturday.  I have to...  That ain't happening anymore.  Oh, no.  You should answer your phone every once in a while. 
[00:17:00]  Jesus Christ.  I thought that was happening.  Oh, God damn it.  You should really answer your phone, man.  You know something?  When is it happening?  A few weeks down the road.  All right.  Did you get any phone calls from L.A.?  Oh, that's what that...  I didn't answer it.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what, though?  Bob is an idiot.  That would be our super agent?  Yes.  He calls my home phone.  Yeah.  Which he's called a thousand times, and it will ring and ring and ring.  And I don't have a machine that picks up at home. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Because no one calls me at home.  And then he doesn't call my cell.  Mm-hmm.  When if he calls my cell, I pick up.  I don't pick up my regular phone, usually.  What's going on with you?  Oh.  I was sad for Saturday, but now I was going to get my hair cut and be all ready for Saturday.  But now I have to, you know, wait.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was kind of looking, and I had a lot of gray going on in there. 
[00:18:00]  That's what I thought.  I'm like, I wonder if it's gray.  Oh, yeah.  That was just, like, too much.  Started bothering you, huh?  Well, because you get it more on one side than the other when it starts really coming  in.  So I just, like, wah, wah, and got rid of that.  But I didn't want to commit to the whole get rid of the mustache thing, because then  everybody makes fun of your lip.  So I just, you know, did this.  All right.  How old are you on a goatee yet?  It was gossage.  Since he was 12.  Yeah, since I was 12. 
[00:18:30]  He shaved it once when we were off the air.  No, I hadn't.  And it creeped everybody out, because we weren't used to it.  I had, like, a beard mustache thing for a while.  Very scraggly during the rotgut days.  And then up in Boston, I went with the goatee route.  Yeah.  So it's been there for, you know, 12 years, I guess.  All right.  Hey, people are starting to check out that animation.  They're saying it's hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah, that one is really funny.  Jimmy, you're the star of that one. 
[00:19:00]  Which sucks, because it was my bit.  When you say yeenie, his little puppet character does, you do this little thing with your hands.  And your little puppet character is really pathetic.  It's cute.  It's a lot shorter than us.  It's chubby.  It's adorable.  It's got a little blockhead.  Look at your chubby little puppet character.  You're, like, two feet tall.  Spoon from Houston, really fast.  Andy writes, just saw the animation.  It's updated.  Wow, a lot of people are checking out the show today, because it's updated.  Way too fast.  Anyway, he thought it was hilarious.  It's called O&A's New Names. 
[00:19:30]  It's up on YouTube.  I think it's in the contest for the $2,000.  But really, really funny.  Great work.  It looks like a puppet show almost.  Yeah.  Yep.  It's really cool.  There's you popping your head into the screen to say, yee, me.  It's really good.  All right.  We've got a lot to do, like Jimmy was saying.  We've got more audio from Dave Rabbit.  I was reading up on this guy yesterday, and very interesting.  You know, he only did 21 shows.  That's it.  Wow.  And he's been alive ever since on the internet. 
[00:20:00]  People are just freaking out about this guy.  He did an underground radio show in Vietnam back in 70, 71 from the back of a whorehouse.  I read the whole story last night.  It's fascinating.  And he was scared S-list because he wasn't sure when he was going to get shut down.  So you basically have a really, you have a clear copy of one of the, of one of 21 shows.  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was really rare.  Yeah.  And he had a lot of shows himself, but his daughter, I guess, taped over him because she  wanted some music back in the 80s. 
[00:20:30]  And that's what you did.  You would, you know, find cassettes and just put music on them.  Yeah.  And she found his very valuable radio shows and recorded over them.  Oh.  So.  Oh.  Very fascinating guy, but we definitely have more audio from him.  Maybe we'll start that after the break.  Okay.  I thought about him yesterday.  I can't, I was trying to tell my girlfriend about him, choker, and you can't translate  like how great this guy is.  Cause I'm like, yeah, he did shows in Vietnam.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  But it's like, I can't explain what makes him so good.  Yeah.  It's, it's a whole combination of, uh, knowing the situation he was in at the time, the voice  and the material's funny.  The guy actually has funny lines, you know?  Well, here's a taste from yesterday.  Uh, we got new stuff for later on, but, uh, just in case you missed it yesterday, Dave  Rabbit, Underground Radio, Vietnam, 1970.  Good evening again, ladies and gentlemen, this is your host for the next three hours of hard  acid rock music, Dave Rabbit. 
[00:21:30]  For those of you who have just recently come into the Republic of Vietnam, I'd like to give  you a little information about it.  So your mind won't be quite so blown when you hear such words as, and words of that nature.  We're an underground radio station here, and we say what we feel like saying, and we bring  the truth to the first-termers in the Republic of Vietnam.  You've got to change your equal ways. 
[00:22:00]  We also bring you hard acid rock music all through the night.  The up-to-date music of today's American youth.  As he's playing Santana in the background.  Up-to-date.  Which was a brand new song, I guess.  Vietnam.  I love it.  Vietnam.  Vietnam.  Vietnam.  Vietnam.  He basically didn't want to go home.  The Republic of Vietnam.  He didn't want to go home.  He was in the Air Force.  He did a little time, and they were going to station him back in the States, doing some 
[00:22:30]  mundane job, and he said, screw that, I want to stay in Vietnam, and he did.  He was able to do that, I think, for a couple of years.  And then he did this underground radio show, did 21 of them, and then that was it.  I don't even know why he was shut down.  They don't explain that on the internet.  So, we'll find out today, because we're going to talk to Dave Rabbit.  That's so cool, man.  We found this guy.  During the night, we're going to be reading some of the things off the latrine walls around  the Republic of Vietnam.  Here's one of them.  While I'm home, my wife is my right hand. 
[00:23:00]  While I'm away, my right hand is my wife.  Cook it.  From the big 69.  The who.  From the rock opera Tommy.  Pinball wizard.  Wow.  How cool is that?  That was pretty new.  How cool is that?  You know, pretty new.  What timing he has, too, man. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, he just had it, man.  People can't find the puppet show on YouTube.  It's O&A's new names.  Or just put Opie and Anthony in the search, and then you've got to, you know, what?  Scroll, scroll, scroll.  Yeah, go back, Iraq, because then what do you have to pop in?  You've got to pop in Date Added or whatever, so you get all the new Opie and Anthony stuff  that pop up on YouTube.  Yeah.  Right, Date Added?  Yeah, we're going to link it up on the sites.  All right, and we'll link it up on the sites.  It's definitely worth promoting today because it's really, really funny. 
[00:24:00]  All right, we're just getting started.  Your phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Opie and Anthony.  They're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey.  Good morning to everybody.  Hey.  We'll be talking to Dave Rabbit a little later this morning.  The Vietnam dude.  Yeah.  That went underground and did a radio show for like 21 days.  Just didn't know when he was going to be shut off. 
[00:24:30]  Getting that guy his own show.  Kind of bummed that he never did radio after that.  Yeah.  It seemed like he just kind of wandered around.  Good voice, good delivery.  Yeah.  He was probably, I don't know, we'll ask him, but it sounds like he was a little left up.  A little bit.  Sounded like he was on the H or something.  Yeah.  Well, now that I mention him, I've got to play another clip from yesterday.  We've got new ones for today, by the way, but just in case you missed it, Dave Rabbit, 1970-71, Vietnam, Underground Radio. 
[00:25:00]  Cream with white room.  We're going to let this next one roll on through.  Why?  Well, for one reason, I've got to go take a big, heavy, and boring, unforeseen incidences that may occur during my trip to the latrine,  such as being picked up for marijuana, or stomping in and getting a quick once the whore is down the hall. 
[00:25:30]  I'll be back to finish this goddamn program.  Program.  I would listen to this guy every day.  Yeah.  Every day.  There's one where he plays, uh,  What?  There was one he has a really cool intro on.  Uh, what?  I don't know.  It might be a Cream song. 
[00:26:00]  Oh my god, Jimmy.  I got 40 clips in front of me.  I need a little more info than that.  Did it just say white room?  Yeah, but he just said white room, right?  Yeah.  Listen to this show tonight, because we're all out of sorts.  My back is killing me.  Jimmy, I don't know what the hell's going on.  Is that white room or no?  Uh, that, uh, uh, uh, uh, no, that's white room.  I think the intro to this is cool that he does.  on the Big 69.  And the hits just keep on coming. 
[00:26:30]  All right, we'll have Iraq figure it out.  I don't know.  We got some great stories for everybody.  The chicken story.  Are you almost ready for the chicken story?  Because you're obsessed with chickens.  Coke Logic is an animated one of your chicken bits.  You're obsessed with chickens?  He certainly is.  He certainly is.  My nickname is Chicken Hawk.  But got a quick news story just to freak everybody out.  That's the only reason we're doing this.  You know, a lot of us, most of us,  just about every single person listening to this show has flown. 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  And you're sitting back there and you're thinking that you're being taken care of  by the flight attendants and the pilots.  And you sit back and maybe you're lucky enough to have a little DVD portable player  and you're watching.  Oh, sure.  There's plenty of activities these days on a plane.  Watching The Wire or maybe you plug in and listen  to some of those music channels they got or some dumb old stupid Bill Cosby bit. 
[00:27:30]  Watch the in-flight movie maybe.  Something like that.  Sure.  And the flight attendants are bringing around beverages and food and things like that.  And you're nervous to begin with because the plane's going 400 miles an hour.  Yeah, you're really cranking.  You're up about 35,000 feet.  Yeah.  And the only thing that pops in your mind is the fact that perhaps the flight crew is professional.  They know what they're doing.  Yeah.  And that keeps you from getting all nervous. 
[00:28:00]  That's right.  Mm-hmm.  That's right.  Well, I'm trying to find a clip to make this even funnier.  But all right.  Here's the story.  The Federal Aviation is investigating whether two pilots were asleep during a flight from Honolulu to Hilo.  The FAA says that the plane drifted off course and had to turn around to get back to the airport.  Air traffic control says it could not reach the pilot for nearly a half an hour.  Pilots did land the plane safely.  If they did not off, the pilots could face suspension. 
[00:28:30]  Pray for me.  That is everyone's worst nightmare right there because you just wonder what's going on behind that door.  There they are just asleep.  Yeah, just snoring away.  Could you just picture their head like back, mouth open, a little drool, and just out.  All the little gauges are working.  It's dead silence. 
[00:29:00]  And the plane is just hurling.  Oh, hurling across, basically across the universe.  That's it.  And during this, everyone is in the back just enjoying the flight.  There's no, it's as if the plane's brain had been cut out for a half hour.  Yeah.  If it was a living thing.  And you're back there laughing at some Family Guy episode and you have no clue.  For that whole episode of Family Guy, they're out cold.  They're completely unconscious and drifting off course. 
[00:29:30]  How frightening is that?  What if you run out of gas?  Exactly.  I mean, and how bad is it for the pilot when you wake up and you're like, where am I?  And you're just looking at clouds rushing at you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's bad enough when you wake up and you're kind of confused.  You don't know what time it is.  If you're late for work.  Or you ever wake up in a hotel and you're like, where am I?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I know what city am I?  It happened during like the virus tour all the time.  We'd wake up somewhere and just be like, where am I?  I know I'm not home, but yeah, Jimmy, imagine that.  You're a pilot.  You wake up and you're like, oh, and you look at the gauges and realize, oh, my God, I was 
[00:30:00]  flying this thing.  Oh, my God.  Just clouds going by.  The panic you were having.  Just looking at your fuel gauge, hoping you weren't out for three hours.  Sure.  You got to call and somehow try to not sound like you were asleep, but admit you have no  idea where you are.  You got to call the tower.  Yeah, this is United 36.  Call the tower.  No, no, we weren't asleep. 
[00:30:30]  We're having radio problems.  Yeah, yeah.  Radio problems.  That was.  Yeah.  Oh, well, hold on two seconds.  Bob, wake up.  Wake up.  What?  Oh, my God.  We fell asleep.  No, we didn't.  No, no, he was talking last night and watching a movie.  He fell asleep, but not now.  And the radio is fine now.  Oh, OK, that's better. 
[00:31:00]  This is your pilot speaking.  This is your pilot speaking.  We're going to be slightly delayed getting to our destination.  Oh, if you look out your left, could you please tell me where we are?  I'll be able to get this back on track.  I've been asleep.  Hey, anyone see the Grand Canyon around here?  Yeah, we were supposed to pass it, but. 
[00:31:30]  That's a good marker for me.  I can figure out where we are.  Someone tells me where the Grand Canyon is.  And could one of the flight attendants bring up 18 cups of coffee?  Thank you.  Thank you.  That is horrifying.  It's really scary.  Were there two pilots that dozed off?  Both of them.  In each other's arms.  One of you stays awake.  Yeah.  It's just one of you.  That's what you're supposed to do.  And, yeah, Sam from D.C. says it all. 
[00:32:00]  They face suspension.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's it?  Just suspended.  Yeah.  Someone is suggesting you do Dave Rabbit as the pilot.  Yeah, almost.  I'm going to be taking a nap now.  The Republic of Vietnam.  Vietnam.  I love the way he says Vietnam.  Vietnam.  He does have a Rod Serling thing to his voice.  This guy's the greatest, man.  He rules.  He certainly does, Jimmy.  He certainly does.  If I could say Vietnam the way he says it, I'd find a reason to say it every 20 minutes in daily conversation. 
[00:32:30]  You can't judge a book by looking at his cover.  Here's another quickie from the latrines in the Republic of Vietnam.  This guy writes, fighting for someone else's freedom is like f***ing for someone else's virginity.  He doesn't care the guy's singing. 
[00:33:00]  Why would he care?  He said blank power.  Ladies.  Ladies.  You got that part, ladies.  But he used the T.  Let's say hi to Al in Maryland.  Al, what's up?  By the way, Dave Rabbit's going to be on around 8.  That's why we're playing a lot.  Get everyone ready.  What do you say, Al? 
[00:33:30]  Huh?  Yeah, damn.  Passers, I'm on the way to the airport right now.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Huh?  That flight in Hawaii, that's not a 10-minute flight between the islands.  Those people must leave a scratch in their head.  Wow.  Yeah, someone is saying, I don't know if 10 minutes is correct, but someone else said it's less than an hour flight.  And they were asleep for half of it.  Over half of it.  15 minutes, Beth.  You're longer on the runway longer than you're in the air. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, they had to turn around and fly back because they were asleep.  It didn't look like a small plane they were showing on the news, but, you know, we were watching that news, so they could have shown something that was on its way to England.  What airline?  It looked like Go.  Oh, oof.  Oof.  Is it Go exclamation point?  Yeah.  How about this?  Any airline that has punctuation in the title is dangerous.  It should be Go to Sleep.  Let's say hi to Max in Dallas. 
[00:34:30]  Max, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I bet the conversation kind of went like this.  Tower to United 36.  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep.  Yeah, exactly.  Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, Jeep.  Yeah, maybe they weren't asleep.  Maybe the co-pilot was trying to pick up the pilot, and he made believe he was asleep.  It's been known to happen.  Let's say hi to Keith and Islip.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  The scary thing on these planes is once they take off. 
[00:35:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Keith, we lost your phone crap for a second.  The scary thing about what?  With these pilots.  Yeah.  I fly small aircraft, but the bigger planes, they take the plane off.  They can go to sleep until they get 10 minutes outside of.  The plane flies itself.  Yeah, a lot of the guys, they play cards up there.  They just talk.  But you're supposed to be awake.  I understand that.  But what if there's a UFO?  A UFO?  You never know.  You should be prepared for anything. 
[00:35:30]  I think maybe prepared for a collision, things like that.  Or rockets flying by it because it's shooting a satellite out of the sky.  Here's what a sleeping pilot never wants to wake up to.  Yeah.  Pull up.  Pull up.  Pull up.  That's got to be the worst sound to come out of an airplane.  Pull up.  What is that?  Pull.  Get up?  What?  Yeah.  Can I hit the snooze on the pull up? 
[00:36:00]  Pull up.  Altitude.  Altitude.  Altitude.  Can I stop that?  I'm really tired.  That's really frightening.  Yeah.  I'm not happy about that story today.  Oh, I had a thought on it, too.  Yeah.  Terrain warning comes on.  Oof.  Yeah.  That doesn't work.  All right.  That is scary.  I'm just going to randomly get up to go to the bathroom on the planes now and occasionally  just go on their door. 
[00:36:30]  How are you doing up there?  Just to make sure, right?  All right.  Good.  Got to be awake.  I thought the whole time they were just diligently flying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just picked it.  Off we go into the wild blue yonder.  They got their hands on the controls.  I thought they had a clipboard and they're just taking.  Yes.  Let's check our course.  Yeah.  No.  Checking instruments the entire time.  Yes.  And just going.  Doing nothing.  Shooker, shooker, shooker, shooker.  Occasionally, I guess they got to do checks, but for the most part, they just dial in what 
[00:37:00]  altitude, speed.  Yeah.  Heading.  And then they just do whatever the hell they want to do.  And that's that.  I figured that they'd bring up the coffee and they'd go, I'd like some coffee.  And then she'd go, would you like cream and sugar?  Stop talking.  I'm flying.  Stop your yapping.  Stop your yapping, woman.  Yes.  Get in the back and make something else.  Make some buns.  I'm flying.  Can't even take a hand off the wheel.  No, not even.  I like to call it the wheel.  Two hands on the wheel the entire time.  Take a chance really fast to get a sip of coffee and then back on the wheel.  Well, he probably says to the co-pilot, I'm going to go get a sip of coffee. 
[00:37:30]  Make sure you're flying.  Yes.  The guy holds the flying instruments while he sits.  The flying instruments.  All right.  They're very vigilant.  Yes.  Please.  Another clip of Dave Rabbit before we get into the chicken story.  This f***ing f***er is so goddamn long.  Yeah.  He had a problem with this record he was playing.  He played some real long song.  He sounds very stoned.  Yeah.  And in the middle of it, he's just pissed that the song is going on forever because he only  did a three-hour show.  So he had a break in. 
[00:38:00]  This f***ing f***er is so goddamn long, I could have gone downstairs and got a shot of  back.  Rambling on with more music.  Iron Butterfly.  Soul Experience.  Speed Chills.  Slow down.  Slow down.  I've never been told. 
[00:38:30]  Smoke grass.  Smoke grass.  Underground radio from Vietnam, man.  This is a shame he only did 21 shows.  God.  This is the one Jimmy really likes.  It's really quick.  Iron Butterfly.  Soul Experience.  Lifers are like flies.  They both eat s*** and bother people.  Right on.  Thank you, Pete.  Thank you, Pete.  That's my favorite part.  Thank you, Pete.  They're just having a good old time. 
[00:39:00]  This next story is no big deal, but it just reminded me.  It probably ended up being Pete from N.E.W.  Pete Johnson.  Pete Johnson.  Pete Johnson.  Thank you, Pete.  No problem.  We're being shot at.  Where's my chin dildo?  Well, we might have had an engineer that started with Marconi.  He put on a chin dildo one time.  Yeah.  He didn't want to, but we made him.  He didn't want to. 
[00:39:30]  No.  And, yeah.  All right.  Anyway.  Lovely lady.  Story for another day.  Hey, this chicken story.  It just made me laugh because Jimmy just hates chickens because they're so stupid.  Who doesn't?  And CokeLogic animated one of Jimmy's chicken rants, the slaughterhouse, where they just  sit there and watch all their friends get beheaded, and they still just sit there thinking  that something good is going to happen to them.  But they're going to be the lucky chicken where the line stops for them, and all of a  sudden something great happens to them. 
[00:40:00]  They just don't see the pattern that's developed.  Yeah.  Forever.  The pattern that has developed forever.  They don't see it.  Chickens just can't figure it out.  The animation's up on onaradio.com.  It's called Slaughterhouse.  But a new chicken story.  So there's a tractor trailer.  Yep.  It tips over somewhere out there in the New York City area.  Oh, I think it was Brooklyn, Queens that go local here.  Oh, yeah.  And the BQA.  And he was carrying chickens. 
[00:40:30]  And the chickens got loose, Jimmy.  And they showed video of the chickens just standing on the side of the road.  In the road.  They showed some crates.  They were broken open.  And the chickens were standing there.  And Opie, at one point in the office, just yelled,  Run!  I just started yelling, Run!  He's not taking you to a carnival!  There's your chance, you idiots!  You've been in this, kooked up in a crate, and you're finally out. 
[00:41:00]  Run!  Well, probably one of them probably said, Run!  One of them probably went, Let's get out of here!  And the other one went, No, no, no!  We're on our way to our new life!  I don't want to go anywhere!  Paradise is right down the street!  They'll be sending a new truck!  Yeah.  Don't you worry!  Here's the quick news story.  We yelled at if we run.  Yeah.  He yelled at.  Oh, what's that?  All right, sorry.  Ooh!  Back to that.  All right, here we are.  Here to the BQE.  We'll show you some video, which was taken earlier.  Now, it is completely closed down here between Tillery and Wythe Avenue, all due to an overturned 
[00:41:30]  traffic trailer, and the truck was carrying chickens.  Now, some of the chickens did get out of their cages, had to be removed from the roadway.  In the meantime, northbound traffic is being diverted off to Tillery Street.  And cars are flying by the accident site, and they're just showing chickens just standing  there waiting for someone to help them.  Well, Pat from Unaki is checking and saying, They tried hitchhiking, but they just fell over.  They don't have thumbs, so people wouldn't know if they were hitchhiking or just waving.  Or waving. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, I'm just yelling, Run, dummies!  Yeah.  I'm just obsessed with chickens.  There's some German gentleman trying to pick one up.  Ah, would you like to get in the car?  Yes, get in the car with me.  Yeah.  Yeah, this chicken is good, yeah.  They are the dumbest.  Fight or flight, they just decide to do neither.  Just stand there.  Stand.  We'll surrender.  We can't fly, and we're not good at fighting. 
[00:42:30]  They're trying to Brendan and Brendan.  Oh.  Oh, I wish I could tell a joke we're not allowed to tell.  Praise for me.  It's the first thing I thought of.  Of course it is.  And our audience.  And punt.  And punt.  Da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha, da-ha.  They showed some of those crates, though, like, crushed.  Yeah.  With just little chicken feet sticking out of them.  Yeah.  It was horrible.  Because the chicken has to know that even if one of them has 20 in the crate survives, 
[00:43:00]  that they're not going to use the jaws of life.  They're not coming over.  Chicken rescue.  I think the two chickens are trapped in the crate, and the one's like,  Do you think help's coming?  Yes.  Our other 18 companions are dead.  They're going to do everything possible to save us, even though they were taking us to kill us.  The emergency crews come, cut it open with the jaws of life, and pull them out.  Put them on a little stretcher.  Yeah.  Put a little oxygen mask on that beak. 
[00:43:30]  My chicken leg is broken.  Do you think they'll mend it?  They'll set it.  I'm sure.  With a splint.  I wonder if those chickens in the slaughterhouse, like, when they get dropped in the crate and  their foot breaks, I wonder if they think, Oh, God, I hope they're going to fix this.  Yeah, I'm in some real pain here.  I hope they fix it.  They're being hung upside down.  This must be the way to the operating room.  This must be the way to the hospital.  Upside down with that boiling pot of water, straight ahead.  Oh, that's probably the broken foot fixing section. 
[00:44:00]  Jeez, how many of us broke our feet?  But he looks across the thing, because it's a circular thing, and he sees all of his chicken  friends bald and, like, just their skin and not moving.  Oh, they must have given them a shave to make them feel better.  They're all just naked.  So they can see the wound better.  Better to fix it, I'm sure.  Oh, mighty chickens are cowards.  Oh, they're all used to fight.  They're horrible little things.  They're used to jang up.  There's 10,000 of you.  There's one slaughterhouse guy. 
[00:44:30]  You guys planned something.  Come on.  Sacrifice a couple of yourselves and muck up the machinery.  Do something.  Do something, chickens.  Instead of just politely getting in line and going,  Blah, blah, blah.  Hurry up, get in line.  Politely.  Yeah, at least try.  But the video, there they are, just on the side of the road, just standing there.  Never heard of any chicken resistance movement.  Right.  If there was 500,000 chickens, I could walk through and just kill everyone.  And the other ones would go, oh, am I on your way?  Go ahead.  Kill him.  No one would fight.  Ants.  Ants.  Try killing ants.  They swarm you. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  They'll crawl up your legs, bite you.  But chickens.  And 5,000 chickens could rip you to pieces in a matter of seconds, I'm sure.  With chickens, too.  All hell is breaking loose.  And they will run really fast for three feet.  Yeah.  Going.  Why wouldn't they just keep on running?  Just keep running.  And then they stop.  Yeah.  Threat is over.  They put their wings away.  Yeah.  Those useless wings because of their big fat bodies.  And then they just walk, peck, and get the ground some more.  Yeah.  The threat is over. 
[00:45:30]  I think I lost him.  Yeah.  I was right behind him with a hatchet.  Yeah.  They run three feet and they stop like the guy with the hatchet gave up.  Yeah.  Bah.  Forget it.  He's gone.  He'll never catch me.  You're right.  They start eating seeds.  Who's hungry at a time like that?  Yeah.  Your life's in danger.  You actually have the sense enough to run three feet even.  Right.  And then you decide, I'm starving.  Yeah.  I need a worm.  While the threat is still happening, he's still chasing you with a hatchet. 
[00:46:00]  You're like, yeah.  Yeah.  He'll wait.  Let me grab some food.  Let me grab a seed.  Yeah.  When 9-11 was happening and all hell's breaking loose, people didn't line up at the hot dog  carts to get a little bite to eat.  They ran like hell.  Of course they did.  Not three feet either.  Dumb chickens.  Not three feet.  Oh, they're stupid.  Taking the threat is over.  They don't understand patterns.  Like they run straight.  Then they run in a circle.  It's like, you don't understand.  You're doubling back.  You're running now toward your murderer.  Yeah.  You're actually, all you have to do is stand there and wait for you.  You're like a boomerang. 
[00:46:30]  Dope.  We're obsessed with chickens.  How can you not be?  They deserve to be eaten.  I love how stupid they are.  You know why we don't eat hornets?  Because they don't tolerate it.  Try chopping a hornet's head off.  It will sting you repeatedly.  That's why we don't eat hornets.  I thought it was from the lack of meat, but you're making perfect sense.  We eat escargot.  Yeah.  We eat tiny.  What are those?  Caviar?  Caviar.  Yeah.  A little snail isn't going to hurt you. 
[00:47:00]  No.  A snail isn't going to turn around and bite you, but you're right.  A hornet?  Yeah.  No.  A snail does nothing but kind of slither along and makes you think that a small, legless woman  has gone by.  That's all they do.  A hornet's dying, and it'll make sure before it dies that it bothers you one last time.  Try stuffing a hornet.  Yeah.  It's going to sting you.  Absolutely.  They just don't go for it.  Try a truckload of hornets, and then they fall over.  Try getting them all just to stand on the side of the road and patiently wait for it.  They're awful.  They have to smoke bees.  They have to drug them. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Put smoke on them.  For some reason, that calms them down.  I don't know why.  They've got to slow them down.  They're all doped up.  They just kind of give up their own home and food.  Here's some drugs.  All right.  Take what you need.  All right.  All right.  You know how long it took to make that honey?  Take it.  Take it.  Take it.  It don't matter anymore.  Treat yourselves.  You gave me pot.  I'm cool.  Hey, Black History Month.  We've got to go to break here.  Dave Rabbit at 8 o'clock.  Let's remember that.  We're kind of excited.  Yes, very.  But first, today's honoree for Black History Month on the Opie and Anthony Show, starring 
[00:48:00]  little Jimmy Norton.  Oh, food.  Yes.  Also known as yee, mee, mee.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, African-American  individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot  it is today.  Today, we honor actor Ernie Hudson, who portrayed the only Ghostbuster worth mentioning in the  1984 Ivan Reitman film, Ghostbusters.  I have seen that'll turn you white. 
[00:48:30]  We'd also like to give an honorable mention to Ernie Hudson's performance as Solomon, the  dim-witted gardener in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, good morning.  Morning.  We've been saying it all week.  Very, very excited to be live in Cleveland.  I want to say good morning to Cleveland. 
[00:49:00]  Hello, Cleveland.  We like when the show's live, because we love participation, and we're getting a lot of  calls from Cleveland welcoming us to mornings, and we're very happy about that, so just want  to acknowledge that once again.  We got Dave Rabbit calling in in about an hour, less than an hour at this point, the  guy that did an underground radio show in Vietnam back in 1970, 71.  I thought he had a nice run, but it turns out he only did 21 shows.  Yeah, 21 shows, and he's a legend. 
[00:49:30]  He's got this cult following.  Yep.  Thanks to the internet.  But it started with one guy, a couple guys had a tape or two, and they started dubbing  and trading and sending it around.  And then, of course, the internet made this whole phenomenon explode with this guy.  And he came out of hiding only like two or three years ago to talk about it.  It must have been so hard to get a copy of a tape of this guy.  You know?  It had to be taped over there, obviously.  Mm-hmm.  Brought over here. 
[00:50:00]  At some point in history.  When I was reading about the guy last night, he said he met a guy from Germany.  And they started talking about Vietnam.  And the guy from Germany goes, yeah, I was in Vietnam.  And he goes, did you ever hear of this guy, Dave Rabbit?  And he's saying it to Dave Rabbit.  Mm-hmm.  And Dave Rabbit is freaking out like, oh, my gosh.  Ugh.  And he goes, my buddies taped this guy.  And I got a couple tapes.  And wow.  He's really popular here in Germany with me and my friends. 
[00:50:30]  That's amazing.  How weird is that, right?  Is your sister pregnant or something?  Oh, little Donnie?  Yes.  I guess they made the little announcement, huh?  Yeah.  But she's...  I don't want to call her old because she's not old, but maybe...  She's a lady, so I won't say her age. 
[00:51:00]  I understand.  But everything's fine with her.  I'm a little confused because I know you kumias and you're really not into kids, but now you've got a sister.  No, they are.  You've got a sister that's having a kid.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm very happy for them.  I'm going to be Uncle Anthony.  At 55 years old.  That's wonderful.  Dude, I am out of here.  You don't think I am Voss?  Jesus.  Congratulations to her and... 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  And Patrick.  And Patrick.  Yeah, they're...  I'm going to have a kid.  I'm just going to be the uncle that buys the kids' stuff.  Because I'm not going to be the uncle that babysits.  Uh-huh.  I'm not going to be the change the diaper uncle.  Just not going to do that stuff.  I can't.  I'm incapable.  No one has changed the diaper uncle, by the way.  What?  No one is.  You don't think so?  I'm up to what?  I got 10... 
[00:52:00]  I think I'm up to 10 or 12.  They never made you do it as a goof?  Nephews and nieces?  No.  As a goof?  No.  Change your diaper.  As a goof.  Go ahead.  It's a goof.  Yeah.  You're going to be...  What's in there, my act?  You're going to be throwing money at the kid, uncle?  Yeah.  I'll just be like, what does a kid need?  All right.  All right.  He needs a little snowsuit here.  Oh, you're going to fall...  Get the kid a little snowsuit.  You're going to fall in love with Dawn's kid.  You don't want to.  I understand.  You don't want to.  But you're going to fall in love with it.  Don't give me the bean pod speech. 
[00:52:30]  What's going on with you?  I know something's up.  What?  I just...  Shaving your goatee out of nowhere.  She's having a baby.  What are you...  Missing nail clippers.  What's going on over there?  Yeah.  I had to get my nail clippers.  I couldn't find them.  Very difficult to find.  What the hell else was missing yesterday?  Oh, I have no soap left.  Why wouldn't you have soap in your house?  Well, I had some.  There was half a... 
[00:53:00]  Like, well, maybe a little piece of a bar of soap in the shower.  And I threw it in the garbage and I went to look for soap and the soap was gone.  Why would soap be gone from your house?  It's not there anymore.  Why?  It's just not there.  Why?  It's just not there.  But it's soap.  The soap's not there.  I have to go out and...  Why would soap just disappear?  I don't know.  It's gone.  Soap.  You were missing nail clippers and now you're missing soap. 
[00:53:30]  Gone.  No home invasion there.  No home invasion of stealing my soap or anything like that.  Just...  Walked off on its own?  Well, you could say that.  I'm giving you the Larry David look, by the way, right now.  I'm looking into your eyes.  Mm-hmm.  I know something's going on.  Larry David look.  Giving you that look.  All right.  We got brand new Dave Rabbit.  This is the only reason people are listening to us today.  Can I ask one request from the audience? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  To, as early as he means, look up the video of the guy getting punched in the face in the deli.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  The white guy being slugged by a black dude and surrounded by black guys who are hunting him.  And then they took his money.  And one kicks him while he's on the ground and takes his money.  Not one mention of the racial difference.  Meanwhile, there's a noose found in Columbia.  It's front page news.  I watched the news last night, saw that story, and they actually acknowledged the fact that  the guy, the victim, was white.  Was white. 
[00:54:30]  They said, a white gentleman standing at the counter.  And now you see four people come over to...  Doesn't say...  Doesn't bring up race or anything.  Nope.  Why not?  You just throw...  What is it?  Deli punch?  Oh, yeah.  That guy gets socked.  Deli punch on YouTube, and it pops up, I believe.  He gets a good one.  Yeah.  Punches the guy in the face.  Another guy kicks him when he's down.  And it's on page 17 of the post.  Yeah, thanks.  A noose in Columbia is front page.  Front page.  Why? 
[00:55:00]  Why?  I guess that's just the way they're supposed to act.  Well, hopefully after Obama's president, we won't see any more incidents like this, because  it'll show that you can achieve anything, no matter what your race.  Oh, here we go.  You can achieve things.  You don't have to act like that.  You don't have to act like that in a store that when some guy's trying to buy something,  you don't have to punch him in the side of the head like a monster, like some kind of  monster, and then kick him, and then rob him. 
[00:55:30]  Why did he get punched?  They think...  And I love the language these people use.  Oh, I know.  News reporters use it.  They're saying there's a beef over Isle Space.  There's like...  Hey, what's your beef?  And some white guy...  And you're telling me that he just...  What did he do?  He told them all, no, I'm not moving?  Yeah.  We all know what the problem is about.  He was just a white guy who did something they didn't like, so they punched him.  Yep, it was a lot of thin aisles in this store, apparently, and they got upset with him 
[00:56:00]  and decided to give him one of the hardest punches I've ever seen on the side of the  head.  What happened to the guy?  Nothing.  No, the white guy.  He got knocked out.  It was all right, though?  Look, they're all surrounding him in the back.  They're taunting him.  Yeah, they're waiting.  He knows he's in trouble.  Yep.  He knows he's screwed.  And just a bunch of youths, or a bunch of men, a bunch of people, they just won't say  it.  They won't say what it is.  That's a racial attack right there.  Of course it is.  That is a racial attack.  But, boy, you hang a noose somewhere, and the noose can't get it all over it. 
[00:56:30]  I'm talking about what a hate symbol it is.  Oh, yeah.  If that was a black guy standing there at the counter, and five white people surrounded  him and punched him in the face.  And one kicked him while he was on the ground.  They kicked him.  Reverend Al would be out there.  He'd be calling for some march somewhere.  But, no.  And I know people get sick of hearing it.  Look, I didn't want to raise it, but it's so frustrating.  Mm-hmm.  Because that same cowardly mentality, the same ones that tell us that, you know, black comics 
[00:57:00]  can say one thing on the show, white comics can say one thing on the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  But I don't mean to harp on it.  It's all good, man.  It's a huge story today.  It's so frustrating.  It's on Breitbart.  It's everywhere, actually.  They're calling it the punch hurt around New York City.  Yeah.  I'm not saying that the guy, that they shouldn't report it when it's racial.  I really mean that.  But they just don't do it this way.  Right.  What do white people do?  What are white people trying to deny?  What are you so afraid of?  Yeah, say it.  Why are you afraid to admit that black people are racist, too?  Say it.  Say it.  Say it. 
[00:57:30]  I would love to get into the post or the Daily News and find out what their, I guarantee  you that these papers have a certain etiquette they follow or whatever they would  call it, a certain way of terminology that they're not supposed to use.  It might not even be the reporters.  It might just be the newspaper's policy.  They'll never confess to that stuff.  Of course they wouldn't.  So, no.  It's infuriating.  Yep.  One of the things happening as we broadcast today.  Yep.  Radio First Termer with Dave Rabbit.  Awkward to change this.  Oh, no, no, no.  I was about to hear about Dave Rabbit.  No, it's all good.  Underground Radio from Vietnam, 1970, 1971. 
[00:58:00]  And we got brand new clips today, thanks to EROC.  Thanks to EROC.  Yeah, EROC's been researching this guy like crazy.  While you're shaving your goatee.  I was shaving a little.  Because something's going on with you.  I was just walking around the house saying, garlic butter sauce.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  And just laughing.  I'm just laughing at myself walking around the house saying, I love the garlic butter 
[00:58:30]  sauce.  I love the garlic butter sauce.  And you're doing this because you're going insane.  No.  I'm the furthest thing from insane.  I'm so far away from insane.  Why are you bringing up being insane?  You just said that to me.  I did not.  I was enjoying the Dave Rabbit thing.  I heard it.  No, we got brand new clips from Dave Rabbit.  And also, you're like saying I'm not insane.  I hear them all the time.  They say I'm insane.  I think you're getting very weird here on the Opie and Raleigh Finger Show. 
[00:59:00]  Raleigh Fingers.  I came a little sheave.  Didn't know I was doing the radio show with the lead singer of The Killers.  Wish I knew his name.  I don't.  I love the band.  I don't know his dumb name.  All right.  Here we go.  Dave Rabbit.  Brand new stuff.  Thanks to you, Rock.  And hopefully he'll be on the show within like a half hour here.  Right?  All right.  So, Underground Radio from Vietnam, we start with this clip.  Here's a plea from the sanitation department. 
[00:59:30]  Please, don't throw toothpicks in the toilet.  Crabs can pole vault.  Wait.  What the hell?  Oh, that's fantastic.  What the hell, man?  All right.  That's it.  I don't look like a fog hat album.  That's perfect.  That is very funny.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Kevin, you're distracting from the Opie and Geraldo Rivera show. 
[01:00:00]  So, is the mustache going tonight?  No, I don't know.  I'm feeling this out.  It's not a bad look, to be honest with you.  I'm feeling this out.  Because the mustache soul patch thing is happening right now.  Yeah.  And then some people just go with the soul patch.  No, I won't just go that.  No, if you're messing around and you're going to shave everything, at least come in tomorrow with just a soul patch.  Wow, you look like fog hat.  Fool for the city. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Fool for the city.  That's me.  The album cover for Fool for the City.  There you are.  There you are.  Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at a rerun for illegally recording you with that mustache?  Like a Doobie Brothers reference?  There's nothing wrong with this mustache.  You're right.  It is a good look.  If you're selling Crank in 1978, you should be opening a baggie with little yellow crumbs and burns a little bit.  Jimmy.  He's mentally unstable, this guy.  God damn, man.  Mentally unstable, I tell you.  It's funny.  Oh, I had to do a creep on ice. 
[01:01:00]  I'm a good gentleman.  All right.  Listen, you want to hear more Dave Rabbit or what?  Yeah.  His show is called Radio First Termer.  Underground radio from 1970.  Vietnam.  In Saigon, by the way, right?  Mm-hmm.  Broadcasted from a whorehouse.  Mm-hmm.  In Saigon.  Well, swingers, it's that time again for Pete and myself.  No, not the end of the program.  But both of us are getting kind of horny and kind of hungry at that. 
[01:01:30]  So we're going to go down the hall and give us a big, juicy, s*** burger.  So as we go down and have a quick bite to eat, a boxed lunch or something, we'll be back  for another hour and a half of hard-asset rock music.  We're now going to return to the regular crappy programming of the American Forces Vietnamese 
[01:02:00]  Network.  Regular crappy programming.  Regular crappy programming.  That one was a bit hard to hear, but he wanted to have a blank burger.  Remember?  Broadcasting from a whorehouse, so you figure it out.  Wait.  All you have to know.  Eric Flowers.  Thank you, Alex, from Buffalo.  All you have to know.  At least they are killers.  To see, because he seems to like this word, but it's very hard to convey to people.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Think of a defunct airline, not Pan Am, the other one, and then just add another letter  to the end of it.  Wow.  You could say added fee to the end of it.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  That's not going to mess with you.  As long as you don't bring up the airline.  Eastern Airlines?  Trans-ed.  No.  Actually, you could say Trans World Airlines, because that's what it was.  Right.  So, he seems to really like that word and uses it a lot.  Boy, it's not Pan Amped. 
[01:03:00]  Hold on now.  Hold on.  Value jet.  No, I didn't sing for Three Dog Night.  What a fool believes you.  I'm not going to sing One is the Loneliest Number.  Something's going on.  Jack-Jack's missing.  No nail clipper and soap walking off.  It happens.  I'm going to figure out this puzzle.  It happens.  Let's get another clip in here. 
[01:03:30]  From the gigantic 69, Vietnam's only psychedelic FM stereo multiplex station.  James Gang.  S-T-O-P.  Which can mean SOP or state tax on ****.  State tax on an original warehouse.  Yeah.  Well, you can figure out the P.  This guy had it all figured out, man. 
[01:04:00]  He knew exactly what was going on in that country.  Wow.  Oh, I didn't even hear that.  Scott from Rochester writes, the best line was, update, he's going to get a box lunch.  Song complaint, drug raid, look out, and then he complains again.  Dave Rabbit from 1970 Underground Radio in Vietnam.  It's going to be on the show hopefully in a half hour.  If you think you've heard long endings before, you must not have gotten this album. 
[01:04:30]  This bastard lasts three minutes long.  If you can dig it.  Here's a special message for all you people out there that are going downtown.  Oh, you are already downtown already.  The word is that the OSI is out there heavy tonight.  So, you worshippers of speed and the weed, be sure and take care. 
[01:05:00]  We don't need any of our brothers or sisters in jail.  That was a little special, by the way.  Just brought in from the hot little hand of my studio engineer.  Pete, baby.  He's going back out now again to see if he can't dig up some more on the scene spots that we can give to you. 
[01:05:30]  I know that you're all really interested in some of this crap that we're reading out tonight.  But it may save a couple of you.  And if we can save a couple, then our purpose has been fulfilled.  Oh, wow.  Isn't this a groovy ending, though, really?  These are the only motherfuckers I know that can play four chords and make it last five minutes. 
[01:06:00]  He's disgusted.  Who was the band?  Yeah, what was the band?  What the hell was that?  I don't know which song that was.  I didn't recognize it.  What was the deal there?  He just was bothered by the fact that it was going on forever?  Yeah, he wanted to talk again.  And the song just kept going and going.  I don't know if it came through.  But at the beginning, you hear the mic come on and just goes...  He's so disgusted.  Just annoyed.  I love the fact that he didn't like that crap that a lot of people did back then.  And the whole, you know, just jamming for an hour at the end of a song. 
[01:06:30]  Good.  Good for him.  Yeah.  He likes the hits.  And then he likes talking.  Well, we have the last part of that bit because he's still pissed that the song is going on, right?  Yeah.  Have you ever heard a Wonder Woman song than this?  Right on, brother.  If they can dig it, we can dig it.  Tiptoe through the tulips, through the tulips, we will tiptoe together. 
[01:07:00]  69 all the time.  F*** me and it is so fine.  Oh, would you believe people are coming to the end of the song?  Fantastic.  This guy is a classic.  Yeah, 69 was used in his channel ID.  I know.  The big 69.  That was the frequency he picked. 
[01:07:30]  He could have picked anything because he went underground.  He's wild with that one.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, we're hosting a private semi-pro screening Tuesday.  I can't wait for this, actually.  The movie looks really, really good.  The Will Ferrell movie, of course.  It's going to be at the AMC Empire, 234 West 42nd Street in Manhattan.  We're going to do it right at 11 a.m.  So if you're in the area and you want to see semi-pro for free and join us, that would be really cool.  The first 75 people will get to attend the screening and get a free corndog.  Whoa, stop. 
[01:08:00]  Nice.  A free corndog.  First come, first serve.  Semi-pro starring Will Ferrell.  Putting the funk into the dunk in theaters February 29th.  So we're doing that screening on Tuesday right at 11 here in Manhattan, okay?  Is it now baking in here or is it just me?  It's really hot, yes.  Yeah.  It's really hot here.  It's freezing in the morning and then baking in the later morning.  Dave Rabbit will be on the show at 8 o'clock.  Here, it's as hot as summer in Vietnam. 
[01:08:30]  The way that guy talks.  No kidding.  All right, on the way, of course, like I said, Dave Rabbit, we also have a kid obsessing  with MySpace, and he freaks out about it.  Very funny audio.  Also, we got some man on the street crap.  We love the man on the street.  They offer nothing.  Right, but the news people insist on using it.  Oh, they love them.  So we got a couple of those stories.  We got...  Isn't that what E-Rock saw?  Huh?  Man on the street.  Man on the street dead. 
[01:09:00]  Under a bus.  What?  No, you didn't.  Yeah, I did.  It's becoming so commonplace, you don't even report them to us anymore?  Hold on, I'll show you the photo.  I wish it was in a mirror.  What?  We're starting to call E-Rock the angel of death.  He actually saw...  Well, he saw a horrific accident in Hoboken, if you linger longer.  These are new pictures you took?  Yeah, from going home yesterday.  That's a car on its side.  Yep.  Completely on its side on West 50th Street.  You're like Firestarter.  Yeah, yeah.  You're just an evil entity that walks around wreaking havoc. 
[01:09:30]  Instead of fire everywhere, it's mayo everywhere.  Making these cars slip and go on their sides.  How do you find this stuff?  You're the angel of death, man.  The last one was an old guy that got ran over by a cab, a bus, a delivery guy on his bike.  Pretty much everything ran over this guy.  And he's dead.  And E-Rock saw the whole thing live.  And that guy was, yeah, he died.  Then he saw some woman that got in an accident and her neck exploded. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, she died, right?  And her head, what happened to her head was just...  Her face was missing.  Her face was missing because her neck exploded.  I don't know what happened.  E-Rock described it.  Actually, he didn't describe it.  It was just an awful attempt at a description.  He took pictures from eight miles away.  Yeah.  It was great.  And the latest is this car on its side.  Yeah.  Wow.  I don't know.  You don't know what's the details of this one?  No, not of this one.  I think he's going to be all right. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, that doesn't look too bad.  Yeah, this person's going to be all right.  The car's on its side.  That doesn't look good.  It looks like a slow roll, you know?  Didn't even take down the scaffolding.  Yeah.  All right, we got to take a break.  He started way across the street.  Could have.  Or he could be hanging out the window just scraping on the pavement.  You're acting like this guy just went to throw some coffee out the window and the weight gently tipped him over.  Like he's Hooper.  I don't see any gas on the street.  A whole Burt Reynolds movie.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  I couldn't think of a stuntman.  Okay, he's Joey Chitwood.  Let me go back to the...  I liked Hooper.  Did you?  I thought it was a good movie for the time.  Yeah, they were all good for the time.  Did it hurt when the shark bit you in the stomach?  All right, listen, we got to break.  A string to your leg.  We really got to break.  So the angel of death saw something yesterday.  A new one for E-Rock.  We'll get the pictures up on ONA Radio.  And E-Rock.  As part of Stephen S. from Bayshore's rundown. 
[01:11:30]  All right, hey, time for an Oscar moment.  Ooh.  The O.B. and Anthony Show presents Oscar Moments.  Memorable scenes from Academy Award-nominated films.  Today's Oscar moment comes from the film Atonement.  Presented by Rich Voss and Patrice O'Neill.  See, you don't owe me anything.  Robbie, didn't you read my letters?  Had I been allowed to visit you, had they let me every day,  I would have been there every day.  Yes, but if all we have rests in a few moments in the library 
[01:12:00]  three and a half years ago, then I'm not sure.  Robbie, look.  I don't know.  Look at me.  Look at me.  Come back.  Come back to me.  Stay tuned for more Oscar Moments.  Presented by The O.B. and Anthony Show.  You're listening to the sounds of Jim Norton puking. 
[01:12:30]  On the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Like a baby crying.  Like a baby crying.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:13:00]  Oh.  Oh, there you have it.  877-212-0&A, the Opie and Anthony show.  I love that ending.  It's just, oh, thank God.  Like, oh, very happy.  Oh, that's Jimmy after he had fish on a plane with a nice cream sauce. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, there's a cream sauce or something.  Ugh.  Cream sauces scare me.  I like, um...  They scare the hell out of me.  What kind of sauce do I like?  Hmm.  Man sauce?  I think it's...  I was going to go with an alcohol reference.  No.  I like garlic buttersaw.  I love the garlic buttersaw.  I bet you do.  I bet you do.  Hey, we got Danny in studio.  He brought some audio of a kid obsessed with MySpace, and he's just freaking out. 
[01:14:00]  What's this about, Danny?  Well, apparently some kid's little brother is just on MySpace all the time, and they tease  him about it, because he spends all day on MySpace.  So when they try to get him off it, he starts going crazy.  So they decided to have a little fun with him as they taped him.  What does he do on MySpace?  How much can you do on MySpace?  That you're on all day.  You do your page, you feel all good about it, and then you just ignore it. 
[01:14:30]  And you sit there and you just hit F5 over and over again, waiting for a new message to  come in.  Which I'm assuming is what this kid does, too.  Yeah, I guess so.  He's completely obsessed.  Facebook is way better.  Way better than MySpace.  All right, well, here's the kid freaking out.  I'm going to write him another message.  No!  Good job, bitch!  All right.  All right.  Instantly, I love it.  All right.  He's a bit obsessed.  Let me get an instant feeling on this whole thing. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  I love it.  Okay.  Love this kid.  Complete lack of respect for his parents.  And the scream is great.  How old is he, Dan?  He's got to be probably like seventh grade, so it's like 11, 12 years old.  Wonderful.  He needs a fist right in his little face by daddy.  Not a lot of hip to kids, unfortunately.  Oh, is that a video of it?  Yeah, that's like the older brother and the friend just explaining what's going on.  Okay. 
[01:15:30]  And they're just effing with him.  So the older brother's effing with him and not the parents?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like the older brother and a couple of his friends.  And they're just trying to get him off MySpace.  Yeah, just like he won't even leave the computer.  Okay.  I'm going to write him another message.  No!  Go die, bitch!  I'm going to write him a message.  No, bitch!  I can't do it!  Go die!  I'm going to get on your MySpace.  Stop telling yourself, bitch!  What happened here? 
[01:16:00]  Go die!  Oh, look what you did!  Don't plug your MySpace!  You didn't get this!  I'm going to get my MySpace!  Shut up!  I'm going to eat the wall!  I'm dying!  I'm running the ground!  What does MySpace mean to you, Nick?  Everything, bitch!  Why are you so mad?  You didn't even need it!  Wow, somebody created that.  Oh, my God!  You're just all alone with your wife there, and everything's perfect. 
[01:16:30]  Oh.  Perfect.  And then you create this.  And then you made that.  A noise machine.  He seems like he likes MySpace.  I don't think he likes MySpace.  No?  No, Jimmy?  I'd say he likes it a lot.  Yeah.  You might even venture to say, he loves MySpace!  All right!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Thank God!  No, that's right.  We love catchphrases on this show.  Come on, Jimmy.  That's the result, by the way.  Someone said it, not hitting your children.  That's the result.  Not that you have to brutalize them, but that's that spoiled, I will never suffer consequences. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it doesn't matter.  No one's going to do anything to them, so screw it.  I think if you're a bit older, and you hear audio like this on a radio show, you'd instantly  think, oh my God, if I did that at 12 years old, I would have my ass handed to me.  You would do it once, right?  Yeah.  Would you ever be able to yell and scream like that?  No.  Maybe to your brothers.  I mean, I come from a big family, but as soon as the mom... 
[01:17:30]  In earshot of a parent, you're done.  You're absolutely done.  Write another message, Jim.  No!  You're writing another message, Jim.  No!  You're not!  You're not!  You're not!  Who was the message to?  This is someone!  Did you know him?  Yeah!  How?  At school!  You knew him personally?  Yeah!  Oh my God.  Man, just deleted MySpace.  No!  I'm not going to pin it down, dude.  I'm sick of it.  No!  Just do it already!  Come on! 
[01:18:00]  It's ruining our family!  It's ruining our family!  You're not ruining our family!  Your obsession with MySpace is killing us!  Yeah?  So?  They're laughing at him.  Nick, what do you care more about?  Your family or MySpace?  MySpace.  What's my family?  They're all bitches!  They're bitches!  God!  Help!  You f***ing bitch!  Go f***ing die!  Scott from Rochester.  Holy yes.  Is a 12-year-old too old to abort? 
[01:18:30]  Wow.  That is brutal.  That scream.  Yeah, it just goes right there.  How could you be in the same room with a person screaming like that?  With a child screaming like that and not killing them?  Oh, he's throwing up the fingers and everything.  Oh my God.  I would be so dead.  He's angry.  I would be so dead.  And when the clip started, you could hear the kid like sniffling and sobbing.  So he was obviously crying like even before they started filming.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why they pulled the camera out. 
[01:19:00]  I don't think anyone wants to hear the third part of this, so let's move on.  Opie, that's not the truth.  Really, Jimmy?  I do.  People are realistic.  I think they're all glued to the radios.  They're not getting out of the proverbial car.  Dude, I laughed so hard I almost crashed.  Did you?  Better luck next time.  Don't tell me that again.  I don't want to hear almost.  I don't want to hear your call.  I want you to be dead.  You never pulled over either.  I laughed very hard listening to the radio.  I never had to pull over.  I had to pull over. 
[01:19:30]  Well, I was out of gas at that time, but I found it very funny.  The first time I heard that, I really thought someone pulled over.  I'm like, well, I killed.  Yeah, yeah.  No, you didn't pull over.  My favorite is, thanks to you guys, I was late for work today.  I was sitting in the car in the parking lot.  And listening to all that Dave Rabbit stuff.  Yeah.  I had to clean all the coffee off the inside of my windshield.  I hope you got fired for being late to work.  Oh.  You f***ing die!  You!  You!  You! 
[01:20:00]  We just showed this, but you're like a senior in high school.  I know.  My space doesn't exist anymore.  What are you going to do when my space goes away?  What is it going to happen to be here?  Just go away.  Leave me alone.  If you could say anything to Tom right now, what would he say?  To go kill you.  What?  Tom, you're a f***ing bitch. 
[01:20:30]  Go die.  Wow.  Why are they taunting this kid?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I love the kid because I hate him.  Yeah.  But these guys are really nasty.  They're being really mean to this kid.  Is the female voice that mom or just some...  No, I just think that's one of their friends.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I don't think a mom would act that way.  I'm siding with the bullies.  This kid sucks.  So much.  And they're just teasing.  You can tell they're just being sick.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Because they're laughing at him.  They're not hitting him.  What happens when there is no MySpace?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Just being all sarcastic.  Yeah, yeah.  When you're a senior in high school and there is no MySpace.  MySpace is tearing our family apart.  I'm rotting the ground.  Why are we looking at one long commercial of fatties trying to get back into shape?  It's like a Bowflex commercial.  Why are we watching Bowflex, man?  The world is pretty much blown up around us and you've got a Bowflex commercial on.  Who put that on? 
[01:21:30]  It was fun for 30 seconds.  And it's been on for five, ten minutes at this point.  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Now we're back to normal.  Thank you.  Yeah, let's say hi to Jeff in Connecticut.  Jeff, what's up?  Oh, I was just wondering if Aunt's sister has seen this video yet.  Well, you know, that's their deal.  Are you happy for your sister?  I'm very happy.  You could be a mom.  Absolutely.  I'm happy for my mom. 
[01:22:00]  She's finally going to get to be grandma.  Probably going about time.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  This kid sounds like a poster child for abortion.  You know, when it brought up the poster child thing is really funny.  It always is.  Because that means it's like the quintessential example.  Exactly.  Like that was, sir, no disrespect.  You're the poster child.  Yeah.  For a hacky call.  I'm sure he'll be on the message board post one.  Why does Norton have the drug?  Douche.  Hey, can we go back to Dawn being pregnant, Anthony's sister? 
[01:22:30]  Hey, it's good for the form of his show better.  It's better for Tommy.  Sure.  It came across weird.  And I love Donnie.  Yes.  I've known the cool me is for way too long.  Yeah.  Oof.  14 years, I think.  Wow.  Wow is right.  And I just know a little bit about the kumias and pretty much right down the line, none  of them wanted kids.  None of them.  Well.  And I guess she's a bit older. 
[01:23:00]  And I wasn't trying to say that she's a bit older having a kid.  It just came out wrong.  I just know that she didn't really want to have kids.  You didn't want to have kids.  And Joey didn't really want to have kids.  Yeah.  I know she's ecstatic.  I know she's very happy.  She's a kid.  Yes.  So that's all.  Dawn.  No, Dawn.  This came out of nowhere is what I'm saying, because what I know about Dawn, she was not  going to be a mom.  Dawn did want kids.  She did.  But she was very career oriented.  Ah.  So that kept her from having kids. 
[01:23:30]  Okay.  Kind of, you know, good thing, because it would have been daddy, rock and roll Johnny  Race.  Oof.  Rock and roll.  Oh, rock and roll.  Bling, bling.  Linger longer.  It's right on that one.  And, uh...  Wait, who was he?  He was with your sister?  Remember rock and roll?  I vaguely remember.  I don't know what he did.  He doesn't know what he did.  Rock and roll.  I don't know.  He never did anything.  He just...  He was my sister's husband.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  He was a good guy, but you would try to talk to him, like, in settings. 
[01:24:00]  Like, hey, what's up, Johnny?  How's the...  Rock and roll!  Rock and roll.  Johnny would be the life of the party, no matter where he was.  But that's all he would say, is rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  He had to be the guy with the giant martini glass.  You know, like the gag martini glass, but actually full of martini.  Yeah.  Is it, Alky?  He enjoyed his beverage.  Yes.  Yes, he did.  So that came across weird.  I'm very happy for Don.  Yeah.  I was just shocked, because this came out of left field.  That's all.  Yeah.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Hey, more Dave Rabbit as we go on a break, because we're getting ready for the big interview 
[01:24:30]  with this guy.  Yeah.  I guess he's kind of a...  I don't know.  I don't know what he is.  He's very mysterious, right, E-Rock?  Mysterious.  E-Rock was talking to the guy, and he didn't even want to admit that he was the guy for  a while.  Really?  What's he doing?  A bit of paranoia?  What was going on, E-Rock?  I guess there's a lot of people trying to track down who the real guy is, and the guy  just values his privacy.  He didn't want to admit to a lot of things, so it took a while.  You know, as you're talking, I'd like to throw a fastball at your glasses. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, and E-Rock just goes, of course.  Well, he's right, but it was only because he was stammering through that very...  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Eric.  All right, well, we're going to talk to him.  He did underground radio in Vietnam, Saigon.  He only did 21 shows.  That's it.  Because they were chasing him.  They were trying to figure out where this guy was broadcasting from, and it turned out  he was broadcasting from a whorehouse.  He rented one of the rooms that they needed.  And they couldn't even find him?  Were they looking for him?  Is that the problem?  What I read, man, every day he was paranoid that he was going to get caught.  Wow.  So he was scared. 
[01:25:30]  Well, there's so many whorehouses there, too, in Vietnam.  It's probably hard to find one whorehouse.  Right.  Probably three or four.  Perhaps more than that, Ant.  And he had to get the word out that he was doing this underground radio, because they had  the, what was it called?  The army, you know, the government radio that they set up for the guys.  What was it called again?  The Armed Forces Vietnam Network.  Which is, like, crap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were kind of by-the-book radio.  By-the-book.  Yeah.  And a lot of the guys knew it was crap, so they figured out how to break into that broadcast 
[01:26:00]  so this guy could say, look, starting in a few minutes, I'm going to be doing this  crazy show on...  Pirated it.  Yeah.  On the Frequency 69.  And that's how it started.  And then it just kind of blew up for a quick, a short amount of time.  21 days, and that was it.  Then done.  And then he just disappeared.  Yeah.  And he had something.  He should have been doing radio all along.  Yep.  Here's another clip from his underground radio show.  Here's another Dave Rabbit philosophy. 
[01:26:30]  Candy is sweet, but...  Won't rot your teeth.  I'm not saying Vietnamese...  That is.  American...  Won't rot your teeth.  Words to live by, Lloyd.  Words to live by.  And then he's got a hitchhiker commercial here.  And now here's one of our most requested commercials.  Our hitchhiker commercial.  Listen closely and take heed. 
[01:27:00]  Say, do you have advantage of a jeep pickup or a deuce and a half?  No.  Do you get to drive where you want to go?  No.  Here's something to think about.  Okay.  Have you ever seen some troop trudging along the roadside and thought about giving him  a lift?  Many times.  Don't.  Why?  Instead, run the son of a bitch over.  Yeah.  I mean, after all, what are they going to do?  Send you to Vietnam?  Ha ha.  I fooled you, sister.  They already did.  Ha ha.  Right on, as Pete would say.  Oh, wow. 
[01:27:30]  Right on, as Pete would say.  All right.  Let's be honest.  This guy's smooth.  Just like our show, not every bit's going to work for Dave.  Ah, no.  That one fell a little short.  I kind of like that whole run them over with the jeep, though.  That's nice.  Today, the Base Exchange has received a new shipment of items to really blow your mind.  Mr. Pump Ride told us today that the BX now hasn't stocked the following non-rationed  items for all you swinging first-termers here in the Republic of Vietnam. 
[01:28:00]  This is a f***ing joke.  LSD, marijuana, goofballs, red eyes, gas, incense, and for those of you who are just starting  out in a plane room.  Yes, take advantage of the big savings at the BX.  Yeah, these fantastic new items.  Stock up now and avoid rush.  Remember, the money you spend at the BX is eventually return to you in other fun ways.  Ha!  This is a f***ing joke.  Wow, really? 
[01:28:30]  How wasted was this guy?  You know, Vietnam sounded fun.  They made Vietnam sound fun.  Well, that was his goal.  He was trying to, you know, get a laugh going for the guys.  Get a little laugh.  As they were scared assless out there in the jungle.  Or a Bouncing Betty removes your manhood.  Looking for Charlie.  Wonderful.  Would they?  Oh, yeah.  What's a Bouncing Betty?  It's a landmine that you would step on.  And a small charge would go, boonk, and fire an explosive up just at groin level where 
[01:29:00]  it would explode and remove your manhood.  Were there guys that lost a general?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Plenty.  Their strategy was, with mines, was more to wound the soldier than to kill them because  a wounded soldier takes out at least three guys because you need two guys to carry back  the wounded soldier. 
[01:29:30]  So instead of killing them, which would take out the one guy, they would wound him in horrible  fashion like that.  It's also more demoralizing when you see people alive with no legs and missing a penis.  I mean, dead is dead.  I caught one.  I mean, it sucks.  But to have a guy alive and see him living like that, you know, using a bag because he's  been blown apart.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's pretty bad.  Hmm.  One more clip before break.  And here's a dedication to the lifers around the Republic of Vietnam who during the day 
[01:30:00]  act establishment in that night, turning to swingers, Purple Haze, Jimi Hendrix.  All right.  We're going to be talking to Dave Rabbit hopefully right after the break.  So stay right there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton in studio, of course, playing the egg in Albany this weekend, Jimmy. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah, this Friday night only.  It's one show.  Friday, February 22nd.  It's 8 o'clock.  The egg in Albany, upstate New York.  518-473-1845.  Or go to Ticketmaster.com or TheEgg.org.  Very nice.  Getting ready to talk to Dave Rabbit.  Good.  About his underground radio show that he did in Vietnam for 21 days.  Damn.  People are talking about it 40 years later. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Amazing.  38 years later.  Whatever.  He's around 60 years old now.  Is he crazy?  I don't know.  We're going to find out.  I don't know.  Senile.  Remember?  Remember when we talked to the cartoon voices?  Oh, God.  Remember when we were all psyched and everything and he turned out to be a nut?  Not a nut.  He was...  He was senile.  I think he was suffering from all the numbers.  He was senile.  Great.  What was his name again?  Don...  Don...  Don...  Don...  Don...  Something.  Don... 
[01:31:30]  Don Messick.  Yeah, yeah.  Don Messick.  He did the voice of Ricochet Rabbit.  The voice of every cartoon character.  All the Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  And Anthony being really into voices and stuff, we thought this would be a treat.  And we're saying how great he is, and he's going, you mean me?  Yes.  You mean me?  We'll have to play that at a later...  Yeah.  A later date. 
[01:32:00]  Someone remind us of that one.  But I hope this guy's of sound mind.  I think he is.  Hey, Anthony is turning into a fanboy when it comes to Lost, especially.  I'm a fan of the show, and when we have guests from the show on our show, I like to ask them  things, and perhaps I get a little overzealous.  A little chatty.  A little chatty, because I am very excited to have that.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. 
[01:32:30]  That's, uh...  You get a bit chatty.  Yeah, I do.  You focus right in on the guest.  You forget that you're doing a show with others.  Yeah.  And you just start talking and talking and talking.  So we had Ben from Lost on the show, and the boys put this together.  Previously on Lost.  Ben from Lost, of course, and great to have you here.  Huge fan of the show, like Ops said, as is everybody. 
[01:33:00]  It is one of the most talked about shows.  There aren't many shows like that.  You've got to be really proud to be on a successful show.  Did you see the potential for this?  Did you know you were going to be on the show?  Any part of that Ben character in you?  It's very difficult.  Interesting character.  There you go.  Anthony hijacked my plug. 
[01:33:30]  I know.  Did you hear the end of yesterday's show?  I felt bad for a second.  We were talking to Locke from Lost.  To Terry O'Quinn was in, and we had a fun time with him.  And at the end, I hear the music going, which means that we have to get our plugs out for everybody.  So I try to get the plug for Lost.  Not that you need to know that.  But I just happened to mention it.  And it was almost like I was standing at a counter ordering something,  and Anthony came in and shoulder pushed me out of the way and just finished my order.  I'm like, can I have the chili?  And he pushed me. 
[01:34:00]  Con carne?  I like the chili con carne.  You got it?  Yeah, listen, Anthony, just babbling.  But obviously, Terry O'Quinn on Lost, which is every Thursday night.  Thursday night.  Come on.  9 o'clock.  Thursday night, 9 o'clock on the ABC.  I love it.  Amazing.  Just an amazing show.  I've never been so hooked on a show, probably ever, where I can't miss it.  And I get annoyed when I, but I, but he forgets his other people in the studio. 
[01:34:30]  No.  I'm glad Bob Kelly finally brought that to everyone's attention, because we all wanted to say it.  And it was better that Bob Kelly said it.  I was very excited to have them in the studio.  And what am I going to say?  Wait, Ant had his hands on his hips, looking down at the floor and talking, while Michael  Emerson was signing some things.  What do you, what do you mean?  I did.  Well, um, Michael was over there by the table. 
[01:35:00]  Ant was, uh, holding his hips and just doing the, the, the shaking of the head and talking  while Michael's just signing everything.  Oh, God.  What are you saying?  Ant was babbling?  I'm a douche.  I know.  Yeah.  What can I tell you?  I, I, I.  The guys you're signing, uh-huh, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Hey, I want to get in there and be like, like, I know the guy.  Yeah.  Like, if you saw me on the street, I'd be able to go, hey, how you doing?  You go, Anthony, what's up? 
[01:35:30]  You wanted to have that moment with him where he's like, you're special.  Yes.  Yes.  Well, we have an important caller.  Thank you.  All right, I got to interrupt this because we got Dave Rabbit on the phone.  Uh, Dave.  Yeah.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you, sir?  Hey, brothers.  What's happening?  Well, we've been having a lot of fun playing some clips from your, uh, underground radio  show from 1970, Saigon, Vietnam.  I love it, brother.  I love it.  Yeah.  And, um, I got to tell you, um, I, I, I started radio in college and I was in a fraternity 
[01:36:00]  and this guy, Stork, and this guy, I think, uh, Joe also had it, or I think we might've  got it from Joe, uh, had this tape of you doing, um, doing, uh, first termer, the first,  it was called first termer, right?  Yeah.  Radio first termer.  Uh-huh.  And we were amazed by this cassette and no one knew anything about you.  No one knew anything about the show.  And, uh, we would listen to it every once in a while.  And then I, I got a copy of it.  I just threw it in a box and, uh, I don't know, 15, 20 years go, you know, go by and 
[01:36:30]  all of a sudden I'm unloading my, uh, apartment and I find this thing and I'm like, oh my God,  I used to love this tape.  And I brought it on the, uh, into the show and, uh, we've been playing it and just freaking  out about it.  Yeah.  E-Rock sent me a copy of the show yesterday.  I wasn't available to listen to it, but yeah, you guys, you guys rock and roll, brother.  You really did.  Well, you, uh, you had, uh, quite the show back then.  I mean, um, what was it, were you, were you a pirate station?  Were you, uh, taking over a signal? 
[01:37:00]  How did it actually work?  Well, I mean, it was the obvious version.  It actually started when I was on my second tour in FanRang.  I was associated with a legal AFVN, uh, radio station called Radio FanRang.  And my, my roommate, Jim Brookshire is the one that got me involved as his studio engineer.  And as it turned out, when I, uh, left that assignment to go to Saigon, uh, we had a rocket  attack that morning that I was leaving to go back home on, uh, R and R and, um, a rocket 
[01:37:30]  landed in our room, killed Jim.  Um, and you know, if I had been laying there, I'd been dead too.  So it really rocked me to my roots because this was just a, a generous, sweet, loving  guy that would have, you know, done anything for anybody in humanity.  And it was a senseless war to begin with.  And the fact that he was taken, uh, angered me tremendously.  So when we got to Saigon, uh, my mission was to do something that AFVN was never going to 
[01:38:00]  do or stars and stripes.  And that was to bring, uh, rock and roll to the troops on the front lines.  And I'm talking to army Marines, the guys that were every day lugging through the, you  know, all the swamp and the forest and the trees and all that.  Uh, and, uh, and, and that's what we did.  And, you know, it took us two months and pre-production just to get everything together  to where we could even get on air.  So you decided you couldn't go onto a real rate, like a regular radio station.  How did you decide where to broadcast from? 
[01:38:30]  I mean, this was done basically from a whorehouse, right?  Yeah.  I mean, uh, Pete, Pete Sadler, not his real name, uh, was a frequent flyer at, uh, Madam  Hose.  And, uh, so anyway, uh, he says, uh, I said, we, we need a place.  And we couldn't do it on the base, obviously.  I mean, that was a little bit of a little no brainer.  So he says, well, yeah, let's go down to Madam Hose.  And I said, okay, sure.  You know, and then we met Madam Hose and, um, offered her, uh, gave her, gave her one 
[01:39:00]  of those, uh, uh, Vito Corleone things, you know, an offer she couldn't refuse basically  was she got to keep the mattresses and all the equipment when we got through kind of  part of her situation, you know?  Well, they set up the studio by, I should just jump in real fast.  So they set up the studio by lining the, the room with mattresses and stuff to keep  out the outside noises, keep out the moanings that is going on down the hall.  There was a lot of that too, brother.  Yeah.  Man.  So you, you set up in this whorehouse and how long did you have, do you actually do the 
[01:39:30]  show for?  Uh, we only, we lasted 21 days and, uh, mainly because we, we didn't want to go to long then,  which was the prison in Vietnam.  Uh, they were really after us, the base commander.  I don't know whether you played that little, uh, snippet yet, but, uh, the base commander  was not a big fan of radio first term or Dave rabbit.  But, uh, he, he made it a vow to find me and, and, uh, you know, toss my rabbit buttocks  into the prison system.  And, uh, I guess, you know, there was something about the prison life that just didn't appeal 
[01:40:00]  to me.  So, uh, uh, even though we had military police and officers and, and lifers, uh, that were  actually protecting us, you know, we had, we had to shut it down.  It was just no way we could have, uh, continued on more than 21 days.  And so we, we demolished everything, uh, you know, it gave the equipment to the, to  Madam Ho.  And then we got rid of everything, uh, burned everything, uh, where there was no trace that  connected us to the show.  And, and we walked out the back door of Madam Ho's house and, um, you know, and never looked 
[01:40:30]  back.  Yeah.  You were, you were saying some ballsy stuff, uh, for back then and for, uh, being in the  military, especially and, and broadcasting to the military.  I'm sure they didn't really enjoy some of the stuff you were saying about the, uh, lifers  and the brass and whatnot.  Well, you know, I mean, the officers, I mean, there was, there's always a percentage of them  that couldn't take a joke, uh, as, as well as the lifers, but you would be real surprised 
[01:41:00]  how many huge fans we had that were in the officer ranks as well as the, uh, um, top military  ranks of this, you know, the, the regular stripers.  So you did this radio show for three weeks and, and were you surprised that the tapes  had gone out all over the world?  I'll tell you what really blew me away.  I mean, as I say, we walked out on the 21st of January of 71 and, and never looked back  in the summer of 1982, I'm at a party here in Dallas and I'm talking to this guy and, 
[01:41:30]  and we're just, you know, shooting the breeze.  And it turns out he was, uh, in the army in Germany, we spot in Germany.  And he said, well, what did you do?  I said, I was in Vietnam.  He said, Hey, did you ever hear a Dave rabbit?  I said, uh, yeah.  And he goes, uh, well, man, he says, uh, that guy really ruled.  Did you listen to him live?  I said, yeah, I really did.  And, and, and, and then one thing led to another.  And I said, well, you're not going to believe this, but I'm Dave rabbit. 
[01:42:00]  And he goes, nah, you're not Dave rabbit.  And so I did, you know, uh, I remembered a couple of the bits, you know, uh, about the,  the toothpick in the toilet and the crabs, whole lot.  And so I kind of, I kind of did it.  He says, Oh my God.  And he, I mean, he actually hits the floor and starts bowing down to me and I'm going,  what is all this about?  He says, man, he says, you're, you're a legend in Germany.  I'm going, how am I a legend in Germany?  Cause I'm thinking, you know, the last show we did was the 21st of January, 71. 
[01:42:30]  This is 82.  How can I be a legend in Germany?  And then that's when I found out that somebody recorded one of the shows.  And I have a good idea that it was the radio relay guys that were bumping our signal  throughout the Cambodia, Laos and in the Southeast States.  All illegally, by the way, that took balls in there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so that, and that's when I first found out that a show existed and, and, you know,  February 9th, 2006, I get on the internet, the kids want to know stuff about, uh, Vietnam 
[01:43:00]  and I'm, you know, Googling, which I never do.  I hate to Google.  Well, occasionally on Friday nights, I like Googling, but only if I have a bar.  So anyway, so what happens is, is that I get on the internet and I find this, uh, this  site that says audio clips from Vietnam and I'm thinking, okay, cool.  And I see when it says radio first term, well, I click on it.  Then I find Will Snyder's site who created the original Dave rabbit home and, um, get 
[01:43:30]  on that and see that he's had these clips.  And then I start Googling and find above top secret.com, which is my family right now that  I have with the ATS mix show.  And, uh, and then one thing leads to another and it's just been a crazy, crazy ride.  It really has.  Yeah.  Cause I mean, when I found out you only did 21 shows that amazed me, obviously the people  that tape these things thought they were, it was so unusual and so different and so cool  that they obviously wanted to trade them and, and, and give them to other people. 
[01:44:00]  And then that's where this whole thing grew.  Cause no one gets popular from doing 21 radio shows.  No one.  Well, uh, I did.  No, no, I understand that, but, but that means live.  Like it's all, Dave, that was actually a compliment.  Like no one just does 21 shows and that's it.  I mean, you obviously had something you, you were basically, you basically had the voice  of the soldiers.  That's why they can relate to you.  And, uh, and that's why this thing become a, becomes a phenomenon because they're like, 
[01:44:30]  wow, you got to hear this tape.  We all remember when we were a lot younger, if we heard something really cool, you could say  jerky boys or whatever.  You wanted to pass this, uh, this tape onto others.  And that's, uh, that's how this whole thing ended up, uh, just becoming huge.  Yeah.  And it's one of those things to where, you know, you get something and you pass it on  to a buddy and kind of thing.  And, and, and that's really how it grew.  I mean, I mean, conservatively, we have 23 million military and civilian fans worldwide 
[01:45:00]  right now.  I mean, strictly from, you know, them finding the internet, they finding the, the stuff  on the websites and stuff and, uh, and strictly, you know, passing it on to somebody that, and  it gives you a great idea of how grassroots movements can really be a very effective.  Right.  What did you do when you came back from Vietnam?  What happened with your life?  What did you do radio?  Did you pursue it at all?  No.  And, and, and, and here's the weird thing.  I came back home.  My family had a business here in Dallas.  My dad and mom were not of the best health. 
[01:45:30]  And so I took that over and, and kind of put my radio career on hold.  And then when I, uh, got involved with above top secret.com and my, uh, my partners, Simon  Gray, Mark Allen, Steven Melzer, Bill Irwin, and of course my partner, Johnny Anonymous, we  started this, uh, the ATS next show about eight months ago and started doing a podcast.  And then, you know, one thing led to another and the show got real popular and we got huge  fan base going.  And, and now, as I told Iraq, uh, yesterday, uh, we're on the verge of going, uh, nationwide 
[01:46:00]  syndication in the next three or four months.  So it's a pretty amazing ride.  37 years later, but yeah.  So you walk away from radio 37 years ago, which, uh, obviously you had the passion to  do it.  That's that how to kill you.  And you only got back into it eight months ago.  Well, actually, yeah, I started, you know, we started the show eight months ago.  Right.  And you didn't do any radio in between for the most part.  No.  Oh my God.  That's amazing.  What kind of work did you do?  Uh, well, I, I, you know, I don't want to tell too much about that because everybody 
[01:46:30]  will be going on the doors.  Uh, I sold my business actually, uh, last May, uh, and decided to do this full time.  And, uh, and that's kind of, I took a leap of faith.  I figured, you know, if, if I'm going to do this at 59 boys, I know you were using your  calculator trying to figure out how old I am, but at 59, you know, I figured, you know,  if I, if I'm going to do it, I got to go do it now.  So I sold my business and really turned my back.  But basically the answer to your question, it was just a business that, uh, was in marketing. 
[01:47:00]  I was in marketing to, in a, in a general degree.  Have you had your, have you kept your identity private for all these years about who Dave,  Dave Rabbit's real name?  Oh yeah.  In fact, uh, when I went to above top secret.com originally, uh, when I Googled it and I thought,  what the heck is above top secret.com?  And I click and this guy by the name of John Jeremiah and his post is still there on the  site.  He said, he thinks I'm a conspiracy theory of the government and that the United States government 
[01:47:30]  put me in Saigon to, you know, for some kind of war effort kind of thing.  And I'm thinking, this is nuts.  This is crazy.  And, uh, from that, you know, a love affair began between me and above top secret.com because  I lovingly call it Disneyland for nuts, but boy, it's just so much more than that.  You know?  Yeah.  It looked like you guys are having a great time.  Why would you, why, why do you keep it?  Uh, why do you not want to reveal who you are?  Well, one reason is that, you know, my wife, Bunny, and my, my son, 
[01:48:00]  and Jack and, and Peter, and of course, uh, Babs and Bugs, uh, you know, uh, it's amazing  how many people will, you know, will see me on the street and they don't have a clue who  I am.  See, I like going in my life in stealth mode.  I kind of like, I kind of like that.  I don't know who you really are.  Well, you know, I mean, that's the, that's the mystique about it.  If everybody knew, you know, that, that, you know, I'm, I'm really, uh, you know,  George Stephanopoulos with ABC radio, I mean, that would really blow the whole thing, you 
[01:48:30]  know?  I mean, they just couldn't identify with that.  It's actually Rush Limbaugh's, uh, alter ego.  I love that.  So you're doing this show every night with your pals and stuff and every day you're, you're  thinking this is going to be the last show.  There's no way I could keep this going, right?  Oh, well, we, you know, every day was a gamble.  I mean, it really was because I mean, they were trying to find it with triangulations and all  kinds of stuff and it was really impossible for them to do it because of the radio relay  guys.  I mean, we were on three hours only, you know, during that window of opportunity. 
[01:49:00]  So, I mean, they tried, I mean, they tried real hard, but here, here's why we stopped  the military police, the OSI office of special investigation, the military, these guys, a lot  of them were our friends.  They knew about us.  They were encouraging the show to, uh, you'll get on the air.  So when they got to a point to where their supervisors were saying, look, there's no reason  in the world that you're not finding these guys unless you're implicated with them. 
[01:49:30]  And they started getting a lot of pressure and, and I'll never forget it as long as I  live.  A very good friend of mine in the OSI office comes up to me and says, Dave, you got to stop.  He says, because if you don't, we're all going to go down.  And I said, okay, that's it.  And that's when we stopped.  So they protected you for as long as they could until it was obvious they were protecting  you.  Yep.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's an amazing story.  And you come back and you live your life, you go 37 years and you start up again.  And, uh, did you know that there were so many recordings of your show floating around like, 
[01:50:00]  like different shows or did you only have one copy yourself?  Well, you know, we, we found a reel to reel that was, uh, some trooper found in his, it's  kind of, it's kind of like Opie found in his, uh, little box and stuff.  Uh, this guy had a reel to reel.  He had an old TAC and we basically paid him money to transfer it into a digital format.  And the, the ones that we have right now on the Dave rabbit site, uh, the pod site, which  is a Dave rabbit dot podomatic.com has the, the, the remastered version of the entire 
[01:50:30]  show.  And plus we've got, you know, the Iraq show, which I did is a 35th anniversary with a new  team.  Um, but yeah, we've got, there's over 500 bits of Dave rabbit stuff on that site, but  I can't put everything on above top secret.com because we're G rated.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  We're a family site.  I can't put a lot of the Dave rabbit material there.  So, uh, you know, those guys that really like that kind of stuff, there's a ton of it on  the Dave rabbit dot podomatic.com. 
[01:51:00]  What are you doing now?  As far as your podcast, what kind of a show you're doing?  Well, we, you know, it's about what we are, which is our ecosystem that, that was created  by the genius Simon gray, who was the founder of above top secret.com.  We lovingly call them the three amigos.  And, uh, basically it's about alternative subjects, such as conspiracy theories, 9 11  conspiracy theories, UFOs, aliens.  Uh, I mean, just anything that you can imagine that would be a topic of conspiracy or whatever 
[01:51:30]  would be what we're talking about.  I mean, they have weaponry resources and uploads, uh, really above top secret, secret  societies.  Uh, it's just a, a, a smorgasbord, if you will, of every alternative topic you can possibly  think of.  Is it kind of like, I'm starting to interrupt you.  Is it kind of like a coast to coast, like Art Bell type subjects?  No.  And I'll tell you why.  Because, uh, in my respects to, uh, George and Art Bell and those guys over at coast 
[01:52:00]  to coast, but what we do is we take the same subjects, but instead of being there like, uh,  uh, two squirrels going 69, which is exciting for a few minutes.  And then it kind of loses its, uh, appeal.  Uh, we put levity and humor and, and put, uh, a lot more at ease with our guests and, and  we just have a good time that we, we rock and roll when we get with our, our people.  We rock, we give them a little taste of Dave Rabbit, but on a FCC compliant basis, if 
[01:52:30]  you know what I mean.  Very nice.  Well, Dave, we, uh, definitely have to take a break here.  Um, uh, this was a pleasure though.  Great talking to you.  Yeah, absolutely.  I have to tell you guys, you guys were an inspiration.  Uh, we just donated $25,000 to the Girl Scout organization for their new drive to, um, sell  garlic butter sauce.  Hey, can you do a little Dave Rabbit as we go to break here or what?  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  You want to just to do a typical outro here?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  Listen, on behalf of the Opie and Anthony show here in New York City, this is Dave Rabbit. 
[01:53:00]  Peace.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Thanks, Dave.  Good luck, buddy.  We'll be in touch, all right?  All right.  There he goes.  Dave Rabbit.  Guy's a 21 day legend.  Yes, amazing.  That's what I'm saying.  And it lasted that long.  Yeah.  Cool story.  Absolutely.  Why don't we go back in time?  Uh, Dave Rabbit.  Vietnam, 1970, doing the underground radio show that we just discussed for the last, uh,  a few minutes.  Good evening.  This is Air Force Sergeant Dave Rabbit. 
[01:53:30]  And this is Nugent.  With tonight's news.  In Washington today, President Nixon was officially charged in connection with the Miley Massacre.  Although the president was nowhere near Vietnam at the time, higher ranking officials are positive  that there is some connection.  What, however, they aren't sure of.  No comment from the president was available.  Nugent?  In Alabama, Governor George Wallace has announced as his running mate for the presidential election  as H. Rapp Brown.  Rapp was not available for comment, but his associates say it's the happiest day of his life. 
[01:54:00]  A blissful event has occurred for Tiny Tim and his wife, 19-year-old Miss Vicki.  They have announced the coming birth of their first child.  When asked about the nervous tension and stress of having a first child, Tiny Tim stated that  he's sure he'll have no problem giving birth the first time.  He also stated that the baby will be breastfed.  Miss Vicki also said that Tiny will have to have his chest shaved so the baby won't gag  on the hairs.  Finally in the news, Lyndon Johnson was arrested in his Texas home for indecent public exposure 
[01:54:30]  after he led a group of Vietnam protesters down Main Street.  Johnson was also cited on 10 counts of public vulgarity and one count for shooting the finger  at an Air Force officer.  Preliminary hearing dates have not been set yet.  And that's the news.  This is Air Force Sergeant Dave Rabbit.  And Nugent.  Wishing you a very good evening.  The voice of news, information, and hard-asset rock music.  This is Radio First Termer at 69 megacycles on your FM dial.  Wow. 
[01:55:00]  Those are little pieces of history.  It's pretty cool, you know?  Absolutely.  Hearing what was going on back then, them goofing on it.  Anthony from Boston, do you think Good Morning Vietnam's Robin Williams is based on Dave Rabbit?  Absolutely not.  No, Adrian Cronauer, I believe.  Yeah, he was around the same time, obviously, but Dave Rabbit was doing his own thing.  Very, very different, actually, because Robin Williams, the character he played was high energy.  This guy was all about just kind of sounding or being stoned.  I've had a few requests for some pictures of myself. 
[01:55:30]  So, uh, some of you people wanted to hang some on your walls or in the latrines or something.  But to tell you the honest-to-God truth, I have really no pictures of myself that can be made into posters.  However, I do have one picture that some of you might want.  It's a picture of myself and my ex-girlfriend going s*** in her bathtub.  Now, if you'd like a copy of this, which is blown up, by the way, into an 8x10 glossy colored photograph, 
[01:56:00]  just drop me a card to Dave Rabbit, Pornofic Picture Poster, APON Country 96969.  And I'll try to get one to you.  More music now.  Donovan.  Hurdy, Gertie Man.  Man.  Hurdy, Gertie Man.  He was making up all this crap, because who would want a picture of him?  He only broadcasts for three weeks. 
[01:56:30]  You know?  Although he's probably getting a lot of letters.  I mean, he had 20-something million pictures.  That guy would make an impact pretty quickly with the soldiers, I think.  Yeah.  Mouthing off like that about stuff.  Like Cornball Radio they were used to?  Yeah, yeah.  And then him, he's just dropping F-bombs, taking a dump.  About screwing his girl and the whores and good stuff.  In answer to some of your questions as what the base commander thinks of me, here are his exact words. 
[01:57:00]  If I ever meet that son of a bitch, I'm going to walk up and I'm going to hit that s*** right square in a goddamn key.  More than once.  Would you believe that's what the base commander thinks of me in my nasty ways?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  F*** you, sir.  At first I emphasize the word sir.  He has an inferiority complex.  I mean, after all, anybody that dresses up in women's dresses and carries a velvet purse has to be a little bit weird. 
[01:57:30]  What a set, man.  No kidding.  And finally, the last clip.  The show ending?  This was the last show right here?  Yeah, this is the ending of that show.  Of this particular show.  Well, unfortunately, it's that time again for a little repeat for myself.  We've just about reached the ending of another radio first timer for tonight.  And we'd like to leave you with a few closing thoughts.  First off, remember, there is no black power or white power in Vietnam. 
[01:58:00]  There's only one power.  And that's rabbit power.  Born to be wild.  Another thought.  When you go downtown, we should have taken our brothers along.  In case you want to go for two or three or four or five or six or seven like Pete does.  Well, Pete, I've enjoyed it.  It's been another fantastic night of cutting the air force to pieces and saying nasty things on the air. 
[01:58:30]  And hopefully, if we're not feeling jail by tomorrow night,  we'll be able to come back again at 8 o'clock and blow your mind with more hard acid music.  So, on behalf of myself and for good old Pete, we'd like to say goodnight to each other.  Pete, let's say goodnight to each other.  Goodnight, Pete.  Goodnight, Gary.  Sounds professional, doesn't it?  Huh? 
[01:59:00]  We're tuning in again tomorrow night.  Please, don't whack off.  Listen to all the old face camera instead.  It's more silly.  Okay, Pete.  We have it in practice, folks.  This is our new indie.  Alright, we say goodnight to Vietnam, right?  Alright, wait a second.  Okay, folks.  This is going to be one of the real biggies.  Are you ready for this?  We can climb so high.  Wait a minute.  Don't start counting yet, Pete. 
[01:59:30]  One, two, three.  Good night, Vietnam!  I couldn't make out what he said there at the end.  He had that good morning, Vietnam.  Huh?  Didn't he write that he had good morning?  He ended it with good morning, Vietnam?  No.  He ended it with good evening, Vietnam.  Oh, okay.  Alright, we gotta take a break.  We're real late.  But there you go.  Dave Rabbit.  That was very, very interesting. 
[02:00:00]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Getting ready to get out of here today.  Opie and Anthony.  You got the big debate tonight?  Yes.  It's gonna be some fireworks.  I think it's pretty well over at this point.  That's why I think it's gonna be some good TV tonight, because Hillary is very, very desperate.  She needs a biggie.  She needs a big win in Texas, and they're debating tonight, I believe, right?  Drops an N-bomb.  Huh?  Love her to drop an N-bomb to appeal to the Texas. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, wow.  Imagine that.  She just goes, you know something I know I lost.  Let me just see if this flies.  Listen.  Wow.  She went like 89% to 11%.  We like this girl.  I come out of the woodwork to vote for Hillary Clinton.  I like what she says.  Speaking of Obama.  Mm-hmm.  We got a fine piece from RPI.  He sent this in.  Because you're a big fan of Obama, right, Ant?  Uh, no. 
[02:01:00]  Not at all.  I'm Barack Obama, and I approve this message.  Well, do you?  Yes.  So you don't like Obama?  No.  I have to get my hat so I look like Kinky Friedman.  I need a cowboy hat.  Yeah, you look pretty much like that.  You look like a horse's ass with a mustache.  Jerk.  Yeah, just shave everything.  Get it over with, will you?  Yeah.  So in honor of Anthony not liking Obama, RPI put this together.  It's called No Country for White Men. 
[02:01:30]  Our time has come.  In a world gone mad, only one man sees the truth.  The message he was giving is that, hey, black people, this is our time.  It sounded like it was get back time.  Where's my 40 acres and a mule time?  We are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction.  That's what's happening in America right now. 
[02:02:00]  Change is what's happening in America.  He's holding back.  He's holding back, but I see through the veneer.  I see.  I did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white South Carolina.  Oh, boy.  I saw a black South Carolina.  ONA Pictures presents a Kumya Brothers film, No Country for White Men.  I am having a little trouble dealing with this.  You can be the new majority. 
[02:02:30]  He frightens me.  I hit the story of one man's struggle to deal with losing control of everything he knows.  I did have a theory since this is getting a little scary.  We are the hope of those boys who have so little, who've been told that they cannot have what they dream, that they cannot be what they imagine.  Yes, they can.  If it turns out that a black man can become president in this country, I think all excuses are off from the black man. 
[02:03:00]  This election is about black versus white.  A black man in the White House.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  No Country for White Men.  This film's not yet rated.  You sound insane, man.  I do.  Then you put dramatic music behind it and you're just losing your mind.  I thought I was making valid points.  Yeah.  Even during that, I think some people were trying to make a mockery of me in that piece. 
[02:03:30]  But I come, I thank God, it backfired and I come across sounding like a reasonable man.  What, they cut the audio on you?  Yeah, they cut the audio on me, but enough got out there where I think I sound very reasonable.  Very sane?  Yes.  All right, we're doing a little mop up here.  This is another great story happening today.  In Yonkers, police say a woman stabbed a man in the shoulder because he called her ugly.  27-year-old Kaisha Fuller was booked for assault and criminal possession of a weapon. 
[02:04:00]  Officers were called to Saratoga Avenue yesterday afternoon and they say they found a man outside bleeding from the left shoulder.  And an ugly bitch holding a knife.  Exactly.  Officers were called to Saratoga Avenue yesterday afternoon and they say they found a man outside bleeding from the left shoulder.  They also saw a woman leaving the building holding a kitchen knife.  Officers ordered her to drop the knife and she did comply.  You know why she did it, right?  Why?  Because she knows she's ugly.  Yeah, it upset her.  If you're a pretty person and someone's calling you ugly, you're not going to stab the person because you know the truth is that you're a good-looking person. 
[02:04:30]  Right.  But if you know you're ugly and then someone is, you know, calling you out on that.  You've got to stab them.  Then, of course, you've got to go for the stab.  Of course.  So, just proving the guy's point that she's ugly.  Wow.  What is going on out there?  People are losing their minds.  Ugly people.  And then we've got two man-on-the-street interviews.  Kind of.  I mean...  Oh, great.  You want to explain this one?  We like the man-on-the-street thing.  Well, Jimmy brought it to our town. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Anytime there's a news story and they have a reporter out there gathering up the facts, they have to, for some reason, go around to the locals, the neighbors, the store owners that were in the area and get that reaction from the person on the street.  And it usually contributes nothing and they pick the biggest retards they can find for these pieces.  So, we've got a story about a naked guy pulling up to a Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru. 
[02:05:30]  Whatever.  But what we like to point out is the man-on-the-street guy adding pretty much nothing to this pretty crazy story.  Well, a Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru cashier should have asked for more than, do you want milk and sugar with that coffee?  How about pants?  Apparently, she got the surprise of her life when her drive-thru customer pulled up to the window naked from the waist down.  This happened at a shop in Lake Mary, Florida.  Ever since, theories about who the flasher in the red Corvette is have been circling the area. 
[02:06:00]  There's a redneck that stole somebody's Corvette.  At the Daytona Fire.  At the Daytona Fire.  I wonder if he's trying to get back home.  I think it's crazy.  I think these girls that had to be exposed to that, I'm exposed to that.  They think it's crazy.  Yeah.  That's what they added.  A man driving naked.  They think it's crazy that women had to be exposed to that.  And I love the idea that they go naked. 
[02:06:30]  You know, just a little cute.  Yeah, naked.  Teehee, folks.  Teehee, hee, hee, hee.  Nude, you know.  Little weenie showing.  Teehee, hee, hee, hee.  God almighty.  Just report it like adults.  A man was nude from the waist down.  And you don't need the comments from the people on the street.  I've seen horse gag.  Like, this isn't a particularly enticing piece or titillating.  No.  He was naked.  Ooh, let me cover my mouth like Mary Poppins.  Teehee, hee, hee, hee, hee.  Just two fingers.  And I think when you got a camera in your face and a microphone and the big light, you go into, 
[02:07:00]  all right, I got to act like I care person.  Yeah.  Because wouldn't you just be like, wow, that's pretty funny.  Yeah, it's funny.  That's pretty effed up.  Oh, yeah.  What an ass.  You wouldn't be like, oh, God, I wouldn't want to be exposed to that.  Well, if I saw that, it would be very offensive to me.  That's right.  Thank you, useless person on the street.  We've had cameras shoved in our face when we didn't want them.  And all of a sudden, you just get this intelligence about you.  Like, okay, okay, what are they looking for? 
[02:07:30]  Okay, all right, all right, I'll go with this.  I think this is what they want from me.  Instead of just acting like a human being, oh, wow, that's pretty cool, man.  How do I come off looking good in this piece?  Right.  How big was his penis?  He won't allow it.  I know.  When I lean forward, I feel my breast moving.  I can feel where it just was.  Really?  I'm so depressed.  Don't be depressed.  Just do whatever you want.  Yeah, do a little cardio and stay away from the truffles. 
[02:08:00]  I was there.  No truffles.  But I like to eat truffles.  How many truffles did you have?  I had three truffles last night.  I had truffles.  Truffles.  That's got to be 1,500 calories.  No, they're small.  Not that much.  They pack a lot of fatness in those truffles.  Oh, boy.  Why are you doing a good truffles?  God damn it.  Give me the truffles.  You can run in place and see if they bounce up and down the boobies.  No, they will.  Are you kidding me?  No.  That's 34 C's.  All right. 
[02:08:30]  Then they have to finish the story.  The anchor woman is just having a problem here.  Police say that all they have to do, all they have to go on their search for the splasher  is that he is bald, drives a red Corvette, and likes coffee, especially from Dunkin' Donuts.  Really?  Can anyone get the license plate?  Let's see.  I would imagine they were probably a bit too distracted.  Ew.  You're like, here's your donut.  Good improv.  Ew. 
[02:09:00]  Ew.  Here's your donut.  Why do they insist on having the anchors improv?  Just read the stupid story off the reading machine.  How about this?  It looked like a Boston cream exploded all over the dashboard.  There you go.  How about that?  I would sit in the car, make sure I was in a state that is usually reserved for an activity  with a woman, and order some glazed donuts and just have her play ring toss.  That's right.  Come on, bitch. 
[02:09:30]  Get three around.  You win the prize.  What's the prize?  A bloodshot eye.  I'd say, could you reach in and grab this cruller?  It's leaking.  Hello, I'm here with the Bavarian cream delivery.  I'd sit in my car and play boing.  You ever play boing?  No.  Oh, like a diving board?  Yeah.  Well, actually, the best way to do it is pull it forward, let go, and go boing. 
[02:10:00]  Just make this sound.  Or I would take a jelly donut and liberally squish it out onto a certain part, and then  complain to the lady, ah, the wife.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  The wife.  You know, I had to get out of the house.  She wouldn't stop yelling and screaming. 
[02:10:30]  She's bitching.  How crazy did I get?  We have time for a pulpy jelly donut.  God almighty, how awful that would look.  The consistency of jelly.  Oh, God.  God almighty.  That would be bad.  Must be day one for the sweet little lady.  That's not normal.  The wife.  Oh, I love it.  That's where the improv should have went.  Not, ew.  Ew.  Come on, have some fun with it.  Ew.  You think he dipped it in hot coffee? 
[02:11:00]  It's just scalding hot coffee.  And don't even make a face.  Just turn and look at the lady as you do it.  And then just show her how red the end became.  Look at that.  Like a cooked lobster.  Or just ask for the boiling water.  And then just dip them in like a teabag.  Yes.  No, I'm letting it steep. 
[02:11:30]  Or say, hey, look, I got a pouch with these two little donut nuggets in it.  The Dunkin' Munchkins.  The little Dunkin' Munchkins in there.  Donut nuggets.  Donut McNuggets.  Let me do a better improv.  Ew.  Donut Nuggets.  Pray for me.  Yeah, pray for me.  Pray for me.  All right, listen, we got to get out of here.  We end with donut nuggets.  Hey, let's not forget we're hosting a private semi-pro screening Tuesday at the AMC Theater. 
[02:12:00]  AMC Empire Theater, 234 West 42nd Street in Manhattan at 11 a.m.  This is what you need to do.  First 75 people will get to attend the screening.  And, and, get a free corndog.  Wow.  First come, first serve.  Semi-pro starring Will Ferrell.  The movie looks really good, man.  And when is this?  Putting the funk into the dunk.  Well, it's in theaters February 29th, but we're seeing it Tuesday.  And you said you were going.  You said you were going.  I did say I was going.  That's why I made it Tuesday. 
[02:12:30]  All right, Tuesday at 11 a.m.  We're all going.  I thought it was today.  No, to see the new Will Ferrell movie.  Can I go, Opie?  No.  No, you can't.  No.  Okay.  I want to.  I'll bring donut nuggets.  Everyone.  All righty.  Is that it?  Unless you want to go to Albany Friday night to see me at the egg.  Why would we do that? 
[02:13:00]  Because daddy needs to sell tickets.  Papa needs to sell some tickets.  So Papa don't look bad.  We're heading over to XM.  And you, you're going to do what you're going to do.  Goodbye, Cleveland.  Live.  What?  Yes.  What now?  I don't know.  I was just trying to say goodbye to Cleveland, but I want to go on Tuesday.  All right.  We'll think about it.  Donut nuggets.  Donut nuggets.  Quickly, another plug for the puppet animation that made us laugh really hard. 
[02:13:30]  But today, go to YouTube and pop in O and A's new names.  It's really, really funny animation.  Really, really funny.  Spread it around for us.  Okay.  Hey, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Bye.  Later.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  We're going to try to get him to do a little XM show. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, a lot of people shouting that out at the other joint on Instant Feedback.  They were doing shout-outs.  They were screaming, get this guy on XM.  Screamouts.  I think people would be disappointed.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's good to just, like you said, he lets sleeping dogs live.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's not shitting on him.  It's just the reality of, a lot of times it's situational, and he's a 60-year-old guy.  He's a mature man.  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  I have to knock him.  Back then it was, you know, he's a young guy, you're in the middle of a fucking hell hole,  and you're, you know, your friend is getting blown up.  I bet he still does, still does.  He just started doing radio again after 30 some odd years.  I bet you he would do a good radio show, but it wouldn't be, you know, what we hear on  those tapes.  There's a magic in those tapes.  It's almost like 50s music always depresses me because the era is dead and gone.  It's something so weird about 50s music, it really makes me sad, and I think that there's  something magical, as corny as that is, about what he's doing there, but so much of it is 
[02:18:30]  situational.  He's this maverick in Vietnam.  It's such a time.  Yeah, it was the time.  To hear his voice a bit older and crystal clear would take away from it.  Remember some of those old sitcoms, and they would come back, and they looked just a little  older.  Christmas special.  And now they're in color instead of black and white, and it just bummed you out.  Yeah.  It just bummed you out, man.  Yeah, you don't want to see that.  Like when they did the Honeymooners thing.  Didn't Jackie Gleason have a mustache? 
[02:19:00]  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah, like someone we know.  You for a take, homie.  You looked a lot taller on your presidential speeches.  Greatest.  Hey, boy.  Boy.  So, um...  Where's Sheriff Brantford?  I think he might be able to pull off that look.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm actually already used to it.  Yeah.  Good.  He actually looks a little younger.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's what I heard. 
[02:19:30]  You do.  When a guy's with goatee, you shave their mustaches completely.  My friend Kenny did it years ago, and then Keith Robinson did it.  Their face always reminds me of a vagina.  They have like a vagina mouth.  A vagina mouth.  It's weird looking to see it without hair like that, yeah.  You want to use it like one you fucking...  I'd love to.  I'd love to.  Especially now, because if I turn you sideways, only half of it has hair like one lip.  It's so creepy looking.  I'm just finishing the thought on Dave Rabbit.  Tomorrow, at, I think, between 10 and 10.15, we're going to play the tape I found in the 
[02:20:00]  box in its entirety with the music.  And we're going to just let it roll.  And that's how we're going to end our whole Dave Rabbit thing for now.  Is today Thursday?  Yes.  Oh, cool.  Oh.  We're going to leave the music in there and everything, right, E-Rock?  Not just the breaks.  We're going to...  The tape I got, which goes about 45 minutes from song to song with the breaks, we're just  going to roll it tomorrow at 10.15 right here on 202.  Okay?  Right. 
[02:20:30]  Just so you get the full feel of it.  And actually, a lot of people want copies of it as well, so you'll be able to get it.  Okay?  And then, speaking of Dave Rabbit, he was talking about, like, long songs.  He got very frustrated with long songs.  Yeah, he doesn't like those.  Travis found a list.  It's called the Top 10 Unnecessarily Long Songs.  That's got to be in there, right?  That's number 10. 
[02:21:00]  Very good.  Wow.  Very good.  Had to know that was in there.  But I like that.  It's a story.  It's not unnecessarily long.  Oh, it is.  Sink the boat.  Shut up.  End the song.  I like that.  Play a lead.  Leave.  It turns out they just lost some molasses or something.  It wasn't even important.  No, it was Iron Ore.  What was it?  Iron Ore.  Iron.  Oh, see, I just thought it was molasses.  Someone left the hatches open and the water got in.  It must have been a guy named Bob.  All right.  All right.  So you got one of them.  Top 10 Unnecessarily Long Songs.  Gordon Lightfoot, number 10, with Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. 
[02:21:30]  Well, that song clocks in at only six minutes and 28 seconds.  That's it?  When we did the bit, we made the song into an hour and a half.  Brief.  1976.  Want to guess another song on this list?  I would have to say Free Bird.  No.  They think that's necessarily long?  Yes.  How about Green Grass and High Tides?  Forever.  No.  Okay, then I see where they're going. 
[02:22:00]  They're not really doing that.  Think, my friend.  Think.  Yeah.  I'm thinking long songs.  Think.  Someone left the cake out in the rain.  No.  Number nine.  What a dumb song that is.  It's awful.  MacArthur's Park is melting in the...  Shut up.  Exactly.  Fucking limey.  Take the fucking cake in the house, asshole.  Yeah, pick it up.  Exactly.  Take it in the house.  Don't sing over it.  Exactly.  Dunce.  Take a shit on it.  Serve a nice scat cake. 
[02:22:30]  Fucking idiot.  One limey, one cup.  Who leaves a fucking cake on the porch, even in the best of conditions?  It's sunny out.  Leave the fucking cake out there where the flies will get to it.  And he doesn't think he could take it because it took so long to bake it, and he doesn't  have the recipe anymore.  How long does it take to bake a cake?  Oh, enough.  Exactly.  I mean, maybe...  Why is it in MacArthur's Park?  I don't know.  That's got to mean something else.  And it's raining.  Because that's where the drug dealer was, man.  Do you think it's still like a different meaning? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, it's about cake in the rain.  Of course it is.  Is it about drugs?  I didn't know that.  No, it's just about...  It's about a cake.  I think it's just about life.  And maybe relationships or something like that, or love or something like that.  Like, someone left the cake out of the rain, and it took so long for him to make  it.  It's not the cake.  It's like this relationship or maybe life or something.  And he'd never get that recipe again.  Like, it's never going to come across his transom ever again.  He blew it with a broad.  But why an example that doesn't tie into that at all? 
[02:23:30]  I know.  It's something that never happens.  No one...  No one leaves a cake out of the rain.  I know.  Well, because you've got to bake it, man.  But that makes...  Jimmy's right.  It makes no sense.  You're nurturing.  Nothing made sense back then.  They were all on...  Yeah, someone left the turkey on the roof.  Exactly.  Why would you bring a turkey on the roof unless you wanted to fuck it when no one was looking?  They were doing goofballs back then.  None of this stuff made sense.  Nice bald turkey.  You just have to fuck it before you're drunk. 
[02:24:00]  No, it's already been skinned, and it's ready to be cooked.  But as an act of aggression, you just want to humiliate it in death.  Out of anger.  Yeah, for it and your family.  Who's going to be enjoying it.  Jesus.  Dig in, folks.  Get a good one.  We can't get anything past the listeners.  They all realize that we just want to go home early tomorrow.  All right.  Really?  Yes.  All right.  You got us.  But you'll still enjoy the Dave Rabbit tape in its entirety.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  You'll thank us on Monday when we're back.  Chris from Philly, he's got one of them.  It got a David.  Oh, that's horrid.  Iron Butterfly, 1968.  Running time.  Listen to that shit.  17-minute song.  Are you kidding me?  Is that how long that's?  17 minutes.  17 minutes.  Yes.  For what?  Alice's Restaurant is not on the list.  Heard It Through the Grapevine by CCR, the long version, not on the list.  How about Eric Clapton? 
[02:25:00]  Hector V. from Georgia is right.  Yes is numbers one through nine on this list.  Nothing?  Oh.  I enjoyed his line.  I'm trying to think.  See, Yes likes to make very long songs over and over again.  Yeah.  American Pie did make the list.  Very good to Jim in Arizona.  That song pisses me off, too.  Seventh place, Don McLean, American Pie, 1971.  That song is only eight minutes and 38 seconds, though, my friends. 
[02:25:30]  Although there was a shorter version.  For radio?  For AM radio.  For AM radio.  Hey, oh.  I love when people try to analyze the song.  Like, you know, he knows every reference.  I don't want to listen to what it's about.  Do you know what it is?  I don't care.  Hears.  Exactly.  Hears.  They go line by line, though, on the internet.  Line by line with American Pie.  Exactly.  And explain what each line means.  It was a brilliant piece of writing, by you.  It wasn't.  It was very literal.  The guy took his Chevy to a levee, and that was it.  And he fucking said goodbye to some pie.  That's it.  Fuck him. 
[02:26:00]  Exactly.  He liked whiskey and rye.  Fuck yourself.  Why would he just drive the Chevy to the levee, though?  He's just a douche, because it rhymes.  And throw the pie away?  Come on.  Look at this song.  How that music.  Nice.  And I knew if I had my chance, that I could make those people dance.  With what?  That's a Buddy Holly reference, I think.  It's not singing to Christopher Reeve and his friends. 
[02:26:30]  It's going through the history of rock and roll.  What happened there?  It's cold.  Oh, is that when the plane crashed?  You got the plane crash there.  Big Boppa don't mean shit?  Exactly.  What about him?  It's nice.  Hello, baby.  What a Chantilly Lace reference.  Cunt face.  Too much snow, baby.  All right.  Enough of this.  The plane's flying real low, baby.  Big Bopper. 
[02:27:00]  Boy, they only mention him to be polite.  Yeah.  Holly Valens.  Oh, yeah.  That's the fuck.  Yeah.  Nothing movie made about him in the fucking plane crash.  And the one-hit wonder.  Great.  Wasn't he like a DJ or something?  I think so.  He used to come out on the stage with a phone.  And go, hello, baby.  What?  Hello, baby.  What?  What?  And do that whole thing with a phone.  Yuck.  He was a fucking prop singer.  Oh.  Oh.  He was the Gallagher of rock and roll. 
[02:27:30]  Oh.  I hope that phone was in his bag as the plane went down.  As the plane was fucking crashing, it fell out of the bag and jingled.  And he had to look out on the floor and realize exactly what he'd been doing.  Fucking plane hit a tree.  He was dying with his phone as luggage.  You know the sound a phone makes when it falls?  Like the old fucking rotary dial phone.  The old dial phone.  Yeah.  Just hits the floor.  You what?  Yeah.  And he has to see Valens and Buddy as the plane is going down. 
[02:28:00]  He's in the back seat.  And he looks up and he just sees, as the phone rolls down the aisle, he sees Richie  and Buddy look at each other like this fucking hack behind us.  He now understands that he's shit.  Right before he dies, he knows he's crap.  Because deep down he's been doubting.  Like, maybe I shouldn't bring the phone out anymore.  It's kind of corny and stupid.  The phone is hacky.  I'm wearing a suit and a fucking phone.  I got to hold it to the whole song.  Hello, babe.  For the opening, I could just say that.  Yeah.  Big Bopper's a cliff.  Top 10 unnecessarily long songs. 
[02:28:30]  Let's get back into this.  Number 9.  I throw this on as a goof, obviously, because you have to have fun with these lists.  Charlie Daniels' band, Devil Went Down to Georgia.  Oh.  Well, that story, I think every word is necessary.  Yeah, but...  It tells a story.  It's a goof because...  The devil, see, went down to Georgia.  He was looking for this soldier's deal.  He was in a bind.  He was way behind.  And he was willing to make a deal.  He saw a young man sitting on a hickory stump playing a fiddle and playing it hot. 
[02:29:00]  Saw it on a fiddle.  So he went up to him and said, okay, suck my cock.  The song is only 3 minutes and 37 seconds.  See, there's the goof.  See, they're basically saying the song really blows and it was very...  Unnecessarily long.  Right.  Like, that song should have been 10 seconds.  That song's just unnecessary.  Yeah.  Then you get 8th place, Golden Earring, The Twilight Zone.  Yeah, that's annoying.  1982.  That clocked in at 8 minutes.  Then you got the Don McLean.  We did that one.  6th place, the first Yes song. 
[02:29:30]  The Revealing Science of God from 1974.  Oh.  I've never heard of this song.  What is that?  This is it right here.  This is horrid.  It's 20 minutes long.  Sounds like those fucking little twins that call Mothra.  This song sucks.  This song is as long as a Seinfeld episode.  Yeah, you're right.  Two minutes short. 
[02:30:00]  Wow.  When does it kick in?  Minute 18?  This is the chorus.  Fucking awful.  Oh, this is horrible.  Is he just reading from a book?  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  Did anyone put this on at any point and go, yeah, man, listen. 
[02:30:30]  Get Lee Abrams on the phone.  There's not enough pot.  Get stupid Lee on the phone to explain the revealing science of God from Yes.  He knows everything about Yes.  He likes Yes?  Oh, he likes.  Does he really?  Jimmy.  He loves Yes!  Oh.  Does he?  Oh, my.  Fucking mustachioed pothead.  Fucking junkie.  Lee Abrams is obsessed with Yes.  I think he managed them or, I don't know, he was buddies with them.  They got some weird connection.  I used to always trash them, like, as just to be a dick. 
[02:31:00]  And then, what's the singer's name?  John Anderson?  John Anderson, yeah.  I walked up to him to get a picture.  I'm like, I got a picture.  He goes, you?  Yeah.  You're my favorite one on Tough Crowd.  Oh, wow.  Then you have to like him.  I feel like so bad.  Yeah.  Round about.  No, I'm just going to run around.  All right.  So, we got Yes, the Revealing Science of God.  That was horrid. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  And then you got fifth place, Tarkus Medley from 1971.  That is also Yes, I believe.  No, it's Emerson, Lake.  Oh, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer.  Yeah, we had Mike Emerson on last week.  No, he's not from that band.  I should have asked him about what?  He's from Lost.  I should have asked him about Tarkus Medley.  He plays band.  Lost.  Didn't look like a rock star.  It was a little strange.  Because he's not.  But time goes by, I guess.  He's an actor.  Fine actor from the show Lost.  Enough time goes by, and then all these guys look like your dad. 
[02:32:00]  What happened?  Nothing.  Excuse me.  I just got a text from Pete.  I represent Yes, and John Anderson does like you.  Oh.  Well, good.  Thanks, Pete.  Tell him to go fuck himself.  Yeah, Pete.  Oh, no.  Not for me, of course.  Huh?  Take a stand.  And you know he sucks, John Anderson.  No, I like Yes.  Long day starts running around.  Long time waiting to feel the sound. 
[02:32:30]  I still remember.  I have the worst singing voice known to man, and I could sing Yes songs good.  Because you just have to throw that voice way up.  Yeah.  Do it in a very high voice.  Huh?  Do it in a very high voice.  Yeah.  Allman Brothers come in in fourth place there.  1971.  1971 was a big year for long songs.  Let me think of the Allman Brothers.  Let me see.  In memory of Elizabeth Reed.  No.  All right.  I love that song.  Love the old version of that song. 
[02:33:00]  It's very obvious.  I'm a huge Allman Brothers fan.  I don't think you know that about me.  I love the Allman Brothers, and I fucking hate this song.  Why, it's only 33 minutes and 41 seconds long?  Oh, my God.  You know the song.  It took up the whole side of an album, and the rest of the album was amazing.  I'm trying to think.  And then you flipped it over going, oh, God, I'm going to get more great Allman songs.  And you get one.  And you see one track staring at you.  Here it is. 
[02:33:30]  Is this it?  This piece of shit.  Oh, God.  Mountain Jam.  Oh, ugh.  33 minutes and 41 seconds.  It never, ever.  Of this shit.  Here's the problem with Mountain Jam.  It never really kicks in.  No, this is it.  It's like a car just idling.  You're just waiting for it to start.  Step on the gas.  It just never goes.  It almost goes. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  No, any jam stinks.  But fucking Allman Brothers, man, they know how to riff.  It's like they're tuning their guitars.  They are.  All right, let me, wait.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  Wait, wait.  Let me try this.  You know what would be a great part of this song?  If Dickie Betts just beat the shit out of his wife during it.  You just hear his guitar going, clang, clang.  Just him pounding her in the face. 
[02:34:30]  All right, keep Mountain Jam on for the rest of this bit.  Oh, really?  Yes.  See how far we get when it kicks in.  So that's fourth place.  Keep it going.  Mountain Jam by the Allman Brothers.  How many minutes have played so far?  Two.  One.  Many.  What?  One minute so far.  Not good.  It's just going to kick in.  Minute in.  And I just want to know when it officially kicks in.  There's got to be a time where it officially kicks in.  Fucking boring shit.  This is horrible.  All right, they're doing some double leads, man. 
[02:35:00]  And the other thing I hate about this song, if you listen closely, if you're an Allman Brothers  fan, if you listen closely to Mountain Jam, you'll hear the start of classic Allman Brothers  songs and then they stop.  Yeah, yeah.  Like you hear like a quick like two second blue sky or something.  I heard a little whipping post, I think.  Just like one like note.  Yeah.  You get excited and then they go back into just tuning their guitars.  Fucking musical cock teasers.  Top ten unnecessarily long songs.  According to StarPulse.com, by the way, I was going to hold the website from you guys, 
[02:35:30]  but why?  Why?  Why would we?  Like, oh, you're running there now to check out the list.  This one's not into let.  Even the master computer at XM knows this song just blows.  There's not enough memory.  Right.  Well, it's only 13 minutes long.  It's a Pink Floyd song.  It's a song called, and I know a lot of Floyd.  I've never heard of this one.  Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast.  And then it continues.  Rise and Shine Sunny is the name of the song. 
[02:36:00]  Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast, semicolon.  Semicolon.  Rise and Shine-Sunny.  The fucking nerve that these guys have of putting this shit on albums that we had to buy.  It's filler.  This was filler.  They didn't have enough fucking songs to make a full album.  You should read a book. 
[02:36:30]  Why?  Because it was all about the acid you were dropping.  Well, what if I didn't want to drop acid, and I just want to listen to some hits?  Acid was a big thing in rock and roll music, and a lot of these guys...  I did mescaline.  They were all doing their acid, and then they were trying to come up with the ultimate acid  song, like a song you would listen to while you're on acid.  That's why you got all these long pieces of music.  This would give me a bad trip.  I'd have a bad trip.  All right, number two is iron.  I would put the baby in the microwave, and then I would take a turkey and put it in  the crib, because I would be so fucked up from acid. 
[02:37:00]  You know, why would you bring that up?  Because it happened on Dragnet.  No, it happened in my family.  I'm sorry to hear that.  Iron Butterfly, In a God of the Vita, is number two, 1968, running time, 17 minutes and  five seconds.  And then the number one song, and I only learned this recently.  I'm embarrassed that I didn't know this.  The number one unnecessarily long song comes from Jethro Tull. 
[02:37:30]  Oh!  And I did not know this fact about this song.  Unnecessarily long.  It's a song you've heard on classic rock radio probably, if you're over 30, a thousand times.  Uh-huh.  But they edited it?  Just flipping the dial and listening to classic rock here and there, you've probably come across  the song a thousand times.  The original version of this song was 43 minutes and 40 seconds long.  Wow. 
[02:38:00]  And it's a song you've heard a thousand times from Jethro Tull.  What does it do with one point start playing the flute with his asshole?  At least it might make it interesting.  I would have to say...  You're going to guess the song?  Yes.  It was a quick...  Too old to rock and roll, too young to die.  That was a great song, but no.  Bungle in the Jungle.  No.  I think the song came in around four minutes, but the original is almost 44 minutes long. 
[02:38:30]  Aqualung.  No.  Locomotive Breath.  No.  That's the only Jethro Tull songs I know.  Thick as a Brick.  Oh.  Ugh.  Hate that song.  Wait, let's hear if I'm...  It'll be thick.  Let's hear...  As a Brick.  Let's hear if Mountain Jam is...  I'm all fucking renaissance-y.  Huh?  What was that gimmick he had?  Jethro Tull.  What?  What a dumb gimmick.  But he was a flutist. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, so he dressed like some fucking village idiot.  Huh?  He dressed like a village idiot.  Curly shoes and shit.  He was just going to a renaissance festival, and they said,  Hey, take my picture.  I've got to put this on an album.  I'm Jethro Tull.  No, it's Ian Anderson.  You never liked him.  People called him Jethro Tull.  Right.  Because it's the name of the band.  That was his alter ego.  He's Ian Anderson.  Hey, is this still Mountain Jam?  How many minutes in are we?  Five minutes in and still hasn't even come close to kicking in. 
[02:39:30]  Turn this off a second.  And now the drummer and the guitarist are playing two different songs.  They're absolutely playing two different songs.  Don't even try to bullshit me.  And both are horrible.  Yeah.  Both songs suck.  They don't know what they're doing.  No.  It was brilliant for its time, though.  Was it?  Yeah.  They had to put it on a whole album side. 
[02:40:00]  It just never kicks in.  How can the same people that made One Way Out make this shit?  It's not even bad enough to be shit.  It's just there.  You know what I mean?  It's just there.  This is background music.  Yeah.  For a bad bit.  Not even.  Yeah.  For a bad fucking radio bit.  Hey, you're right.  Just trying to pump this up a bit. 
[02:40:30]  I was delaying because I wanted to talk to stupid Lee Abrams about Yes again.  He gets really mad, too.  Oh.  Because he loves Yes.  Can we get Lee on the phone?  Are we trying?  All right.  We're trying.  He gets so annoyed, man, if you make fun of his Yes band.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  That was a wonderful first segment.  Actually, very informative.  It was the guessing thing.  I think the listeners enjoy that.  They like that.  No?  Well, I would beg to differ.  I would turn off your computer screen if you believe that. 
[02:41:00]  Don't look at the comments.  Oh, shit.  Whoa.  All right.  And we're going to do more.  We're going to do some of the Dave Rabbit clips we play on the other side uncensored  because that's what XM is all about.  Mike is here?  Yeah, yeah.  He's been here.  All right.  Cool.  We'll get him in next.  Mike Berbinklia.  I always have a tough time saying your name, Mike, but I love you.  Where is he?  He's right there.  All right.  We'll get him on next.  It's Obi and Anthony. 
[02:41:30]  Stay there.  Transmission 11.  Receive 0500 hours.  Sector King.  Zulu King.  Good evening again, ladies and gentlemen.  This is your host for the next three hours of hard-ass rock music, Dave Rabbit.  Starting at 1015 tomorrow, we'll be airing the entire Dave Rabbit tape that Obi found in  its entirety.  Rattle.  Don't adjust your radios.  The sound quality isn't going to be great, but you will be listening to the stone stylings  of Dave Rabbit.  That's tomorrow, starting at 1015, only on XM202. 
[02:42:00]  Fuck it before it fucks you.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  So I listen to rap music, which might surprise you, because I'm a cracker.  Trying to integrate the word cracker into my act these days, because a lot of black comics  use the N-word.  I'm trying to use the C-word.  Like, me and my cracker friends were driving down the street in my Volvo station wagon, and 
[02:42:30]  I said, hey, cracker.  Pass the sun chips.  And he says, aren't you going to wait for the picnic, cracker?  And I say, cracker, please. 
[02:43:00]  He's like, cracker, what?  I did that joke last week at the show, and this black guy comes up to me after the show,  and he was like, my cracker.  And I was like, actually, sir, I was like, you can't call me a cracker. 
[02:43:30]  Only we can call each other crackers.  I was like, you can say cracker, but not cracker.  And he was like, it's okay, I have some white friends.  It's not just cool.  I had a white dude come up to me a few weeks ago after a show.  He's real upset.  He's like, you know, people have called me that all my life. 
[02:44:00]  I'm sick of hearing it.  I felt real bad.  I was like, what's your name?  And he was like, Graham.  I was like, I'm sorry I'm laughing, but you've got a little jelly on your forehead there.  I like this rapper Busta Rhymes.  You guys know Busta Rhymes?  Sometimes he'll have a real good rhyme.  He'll say his name afterwards.  He'll be like, Busta Rhymes.  I'd like to do that with jokes. 
[02:44:30]  Like, I like drinking coffee.  But if I ever reach a point in my life where the best part of waking up is Folgers in my cup,  I'm not sure I want to wake up.  Mike Birbiglia.  I like this rapper Jay-Z.  You guys know Jay-Z?  Jay-Z is so good at rapping, he doesn't have to rhyme in his songs anymore.  He just has to end all the lines with Izza. 
[02:45:00]  He'll be like, I went down the street and I saw my scissor.  Waza to my nether and my brasa and my gissa.  I'm like, yeah, I'm pretty sure none of those are words.  I ain't playing Scrabble with Jay-Z anytime soon.  The word is Drizza.  D-R-I-Z-Z-A-H.  Triple word. 
[02:45:30]  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to challenge that one, Jay.  First of all, that's not a word.  Second of all, one of your Z's is a sideways N.  He'd be like, Crack-up, Lizza.  I'm going to go in a moment.  Thanks for coming out to support this cause.  It's a real good crowd.  Thanks for coming.  It's real cool, you guys. 
[02:46:00]  I'll tell you a story before I go.  I went to Los Angeles recently.  I saw people flashing gang signs in the street.  And I didn't know what to do.  So I go like this.  I go.  And they were like, what gang is that?  And I was like, paper scissors?  So they threw rocks at me.  And I was like, paper beats rock, biatch.  Mike Birbiglia. 
[02:46:30]  Good night, everybody.  This is the rejoiner?  I hear in my headphones, rejoiner in five seconds.  What's that?  This is In A Guy DeVita?  Oh.  Oh, my God. 
[02:47:00]  It's going to be a long rejoiner.  No kidding.  Well, we just played Mike Birbiglia.  And he's in studio.  Yeah.  I wanted to come out a bit nice.  Like, wow, that's Mike Birbiglia.  And he's sitting here with us today.  Yeah.  And he fucks me up by doing In A Guy DeVita.  Yeah, but it's a, you know.  What is this?  Remix.  What the fuck is this?  It's a mashup.  Is it?  It's a mashup?  You hear me saying?  I like this.  Yeah, it's nice.  I don't want to like it either.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  God damn it.  Mashups are a good format.  I am really enjoying this.  All right.  And poor Mike had to sit here.  For four and a half minutes.  Listen to his own act.  Dude, I've gone on the road.  They play in the studio.  I can't listen to one of my own jokes in headphones.  I'm like, ugh, just call me when this is over.  Yeah.  It's fucking very awkward.  And he's looking around the room like, honey, no one's laughing.  That's the way it is.  First of all, it was very funny.  I've heard it a couple times.  But I was just setting up and getting ready for, you know, what we're doing with the radio show. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Because he's looking around like, why isn't it?  No.  No.  Nice.  Oh, great.  You used to it.  I've been in so many studios where they're just playing it like, it's like you're all people  out there enjoying it.  But the guys in the studio could care less.  I could have been reading a fucking Malcolm X's eulogy for all they care.  Awful.  Well, I felt like I had a cover for Ann because he's just staring at pal talk.  I'm like, you do realize we're playing this guy's bit right now, don't you?  I actually know that bit because I've seen it live a few times.  All right. 
[02:48:30]  Big fan, actually.  All right.  I saw Mike at the Dennis Leary and Friends.  And Friends, yeah.  Here in New York City.  I was pointing out that it was Billy as friends.  Yeah, I don't know Dennis at all.  At all, right?  So there's no friendship there?  No.  You guys figure when they put the end friends on there, you guys are hanging out.  I figure maybe Jim is friends with them, though.  No, it's Dennis Leary and guys that are available.  That's it.  We almost feel like we're friends with Dennis Leary.  Almost.  He asked me if I was available to play some hockey. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  So I'm thinking, all right.  But I never got the call.  That sounds pretty cool because he likes doing that.  It sounds like that's something you would do with a friend, right?  Yeah.  I had this awful thing with Dennis Leary where a few years ago he asked me, or he didn't,  you know, his people asked me to do a celebrity golf tournament in Cape Cod.  That's where my parents are from.  And so I show up, and you probably have this happening all the time.  You show up for a celebrity event, and you're paired with these people, and then the people  are like, who do you think our celebrity is going to be? 
[02:49:30]  Oh, no.  And they're just like, oh, no.  Oh, I think it might be me.  I mean, like you're apologizing.  Like, I'm really sorry I'm your celebrity.  If you think this is disappointing for you, you can't imagine how disappointing it is for  me.  But I'm constantly put in these situations.  That is hilarious.  Although I resent the fact that he thinks I am too.  That's really funny.  They're hoping for Michael Jordan or Tiger, I don't know, whoever. 
[02:50:00]  It's the worst.  They're asking you to let my ball.  Then that moment of realization, oh, no.  I'm the celebrity.  Oh, cool, dude.  What do you do?  Well, you got to tell them what you do.  It's just over.  Yeah.  What do you do?  It just doesn't matter.  Were you the celebrity for the whole foursome, or were there two celebrities?  My brother.  Because at least you could go.  At least you could go if there were two of you and go, well, look, I guess they were  short of celebrity, so we only get one.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I always say.  I mean, I've done a bunch of these.  Have you done these golf things before?  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  Well, have you guys done these things as golfers before?  Yeah.  We've done a couple.  We've done a few of the outings.  I did one a few years ago.  It was like the worst show I've ever had to do.  Cut me off if you want to go to something else.  No, no.  Whatever, man.  Sorry.  It was like, I was in New Jersey.  It was like a charity golf tournament, children's charity.  I show up, and I'm with this foursome, and then at the end of the day, I have this thing  where I don't plan my outfit for the entire day.  I'm not a good adult.  I think if you're a good adult, you think through what you're going to do in the course of your 
[02:51:00]  day.  But I wake up, I'm just like, one outfit forever.  You know, I just let go.  And so by the end of the day, my outfit's a mess.  It's all wrinkled.  I'm supposed to perform at this very formal event.  I go up to the thing, and I'm like, I've got to do damage control, so I go to the locker  room to iron my pants as damage control, and I take off my pants.  I found an iron, but there's no board, so I'm just on the floor, on a bench in the locker 
[02:51:30]  room, just ironing my pants in my underwear, which is a dead giveaway that these are my  only pants.  And I'm just ironing, and this old guy walks up to me, and he's smiling at me.  I'm not making this story up.  He's like, big smile, right?  And I realized, this was like two, three years ago, it was Rudy Giuliani.  Oh, shit.  Because he was like one of the actual celebrities in the event.  And I wasn't self-conscious, because I was like, Rudy's ironed pants.  You know, he knows what I'm doing.  Like, if it were George Bush, like, he wouldn't know what was going on. 
[02:52:00]  He'd be like, what do you got there, a telephone?  But, uh, the, uh, you're calling your pants?  But, uh, I go up to the, uh, I iron the pants, go up to the event.  The woman comes up to me, and this is just classic.  As a comedian, until you get to a certain level, I think this consistently happens.  They go, there's two speakers, and then you, and then a raffle.  And I was like, oh, you know, trying to be optimistic.  I never opened for a raffle or whatever.  But, uh, and first speaker walks on, and he's an 11-year-old boy who survived leukemia. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, no.  He's not funny at all.  He's bombed.  He's focusing on the leukemia.  He was a bad downer.  And, uh, and literally everyone's crying.  Like, everyone, like, not a dry eye in the room.  I'm crying a little, you know, like, I'm not bawling, but a little sense of...  A little choked up. 
[02:53:00]  A little choked up.  And, uh, my brother Joe's with me, and he leans over and he goes,  this ain't looking so good, man.  Yeah, no shit.  And, uh, second speaker's Phil Simms, who's another actual celebrity.  Yeah.  Gets up, and just, like, does it right.  You know, like a real adult.  Like, he gives a good speech.  It's inspiring.  Sprinkles in a few jokes about golf.  They were similar to jokes, like, dumb jokes I had thought of about golf that day.  It's like watching the last drops of my joke canteen drive onto a desert of cancer and, 
[02:53:30]  uh, gets a standing ovation, uh, which he should have.  Clearly the show is over.  Surely there can't be anyone more famous than Hall of Famer Phil Simms.  But wait, there was, it was Mike Birbiglia, who had no business being at this event.  I get on, literally, not exaggerating, comedians always exaggerate their stories, but three  quarters of the audience left after Phil Simms. 
[02:54:00]  I'm in a room with, uh, sparse room with 40 people, kind of, here and there.  Yeah, here and there.  Ugh.  And I get on stage, and I try to make people laugh, and it's just not working.  Ten minutes in, I think to myself, you know, I don't want to fail, you know?  I don't want to fuck these people over.  I'm like, why don't I make my material specific to this event?  Everyone's been talking about cancer.  Oh, no. 
[02:54:30]  I know.  Oh, no.  And I had a tumor, I had a tumor when I was 19.  I had a malignant tumor.  It went away.  I was, I didn't have to do chemo, radiation, anything like that.  So I said to the audience, I said, I went to the doctor many years ago, and they told  me there was something in my bladder, and whenever they tell you that, it's never anything  good.  Like, we found something in your bladder, and it's season tickets to the Yankees!  Just complete and total silence, and then anger at that point, and then I'm, like, apologizing, 
[02:55:00]  like, thank you, sorry for ruining your event, and I walk off, and I go, Joe, this is totally  true, I go, Joe, we're leaving now.  I was so fucking so upset, and Joe goes, Mike, we can't, they're just about to start the raffle,  and because everybody left, my odds are amazing.  And so, that was the whole thing.  I literally called, I called Mike Berkowitz, my agent who's here, over there, and I just  was just, like, shouting.  Yeah. 
[02:55:30]  Did you get me into?  Yeah, I was furious, you know?  That's really good.  That's all the fucking cancer kid, and Phil Simms with his cancer.  That's really good, man.  Oh.  Mike, people are requesting your bits.  Eric from Ohio, he goes, ask him about his secret public journal.  Well, my secret public journal is a blog I write.  Okay.  Which is embarrassing that I have a blog, because everybody has a blog about anything these  days.  People will just be like, today I went to JCPenney, you know, and there's, like, one comment, it's 
[02:56:00]  like, JCPenney, eh?  When you get excited by that one comment, like, all right, someone's reacted to this.  That's the worst thing, is when there's, do you have a blog, Jim?  I did it one for a while.  I took it down and put it in the book.  Yeah.  Jimmy's was good.  It was, what's worse, the worst thing is when you get no comments as a blogger, because  it's kind of like being in an awkward conversation for 15 minutes where you're the only person  talking, and then at the end of it, you just gotta go, so I'm just putting that out there. 
[02:56:30]  But, yeah, I email it to people.  I should do the book.  I should do a book.  Absolutely, man.  You know.  Take it down and put it in a book form, and then people who read it and liked it would  buy the book.  Yeah.  He brings up a good point, though, because sometimes on the radio show, we'll get into some involved  story, and obviously it's just bombing, and, you know, well, just saying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just don't know how to end it.  I'm sweating now.  Trying to make it serious.  Yeah.  Make it a point.  At least with radio, there's, like, there's no people around who are judging you. 
[02:57:00]  That's the worst thing about stand-up comedy.  Oh, these motherfuckers are, but.  They judge every single word.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We just don't know it immediately until we read a message board, and they're like, oh, we thought  that was funny.  Yeah.  Apparently they agree to disagree.  Yeah.  Oh, and if you fuck up one word in this studio, these guys will jump on you.  Or if I, you know, Jim fucks up, then me and Opie will jump on Jim.  Yeah.  One word, like, comes out wrong.  No.  It's like, ah, he said, he meant to say bread, and he said bled.  Ah, bled. 
[02:57:30]  Like, we just can't leave him alone.  It's really pathetic to have to beat down people to make yourself feel better in this  fucking studio.  But you're alone on that.  I don't make fun of people when they mess up a word, because I kind of understand.  Oh, you do.  I kind of understand.  I don't, too.  Stand-up is weird, though, because it's like, especially when you start off doing stand-up,  like, it's a miracle that we're comedians.  Mm-hmm.  Because when you start off, you bomb no matter what.  Yeah, that's got to be frightening.  And you have to be delusional and tell yourself it went well. 
[02:58:00]  Wow.  Because otherwise you would never get on stage.  You would just never do it again, right?  I've just been thinking, human beings don't like me.  I was wondering how the hell you guys got through that.  So you lie to yourself and say, you know, it went okay.  Yeah.  Oof.  You hear, like, this much response, and then in your mind, you're like, it's like this much  response.  It's a period, yeah.  It's a 10.  Yeah.  Hey, I want to just jump in here, because we got Lee Abrams on the phone.  I don't call him stupid Lee Abrams when he's actually on the phone. 
[02:58:30]  Lee!  Hey!  What's up, Lee?  Oh, not too much.  Everything's under control.  We asked you yesterday, you don't know anything about Dave Rabbit, first of all?  Oh, yeah.  You know, I got that note.  I just know that he was one of these guys at this, like, underground radio station in  Vietnam, and was saying, you know, the war is bad, and beaming it at all the soldiers,  and was kind of doing, you know, military underground radio, and kind of a legendary thing. 
[02:59:00]  And the only thing I know is, I heard he's, like, living in Hawaii as a building contractor  or something, but kind of this thing that you hear about and heard about him and read about  it over the years, but really didn't know too much about it, other than having the ball shoot underground radio station  in Vietnam in 1969 or whatever.  Yeah, 71.  Yeah, 71, and he called today from Dallas, and he's starting to do radio again.  I'm thinking we should try to figure something out with XM. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, absolutely, yeah, definitely.  We'll get an air check from him.  Yeah, tomorrow.  Put him on the show.  Tomorrow at 10.15, we're going to play the entire cassette I found in one of my boxes at  home.  Oh.  You know, uninterrupted, we're just going to let it roll with the music and everything.  Bad quality.  That's a must listen.  Well, I think it is, right?  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Time capsule.  Yeah.  And just, I'm sure he wasn't following some format in hot clock, so it's probably pretty  invented. 
[03:00:00]  Right, you're right.  Yeah, he was actually genuinely funny.  Yeah, he was just talking about whores and blowjobs and hard-ons and drugs.  Talking over the fucking lyrics.  Oh, yeah, just talking through the entire song.  He didn't give a shit.  Yeah, he was great.  I'm not giving a shit.  That's great.  I wish there was more of that today.  He means that, Mike.  No, he really does.  Yeah, he's sick of regular radio.  Sick of it.  Oh, God.  It's unbelievable.  Right.  It's like, God, there's this FCC-mandated law to be lame.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Gosh.  Hey, what do you...  Hey, hey, Lee.  Yeah.  What do you think happened with those two pilots over there that fell asleep?  Oh, he asked him a flying question.  I like how that Lee is a pilot.  Mike, here's your nap pillow.  Wait, which part was it?  Oh, you didn't hear that in the news?  Is this the military guys over the Gulf?  No, no.  This is a passenger jet in Hawaii.  I believe it kind of looked like an MD-80 or something. 
[03:01:00]  And two pilots asleep in the cockpit for 30 minutes.  You know, that's happened before.  I mean, there's really no excuse for that.  That's really bad.  Well, yes.  There was one guy who was flying from TWA from New York to L.A., and this was a plane that  had three pilots, and they overflew L.A. by like 300 miles, because they all fell asleep  with the red eyes.  Wow.  Wow.  We were saying that's got to be frightening when you wake up.  And you know when you wake up in a hotel, and you're like, where am I? 
[03:01:30]  Am I home?  Did I just work today?  And you wake up and just look at the gauges, and you're just like, are we out of gas?  How far off course are we?  Can we make...  Can you imagine the panic?  I mean, can't you sometimes have dreams like that?  You know, you wake up and like, oh, my God, where...  You know, Jesus.  Yeah, but for a commercial plane, that's really bad.  I mean, that's not good for us.  Yeah.  Because that's 600 miles extra, because you've got to come back.  Yeah, sure.  Well, the worst part is explaining yourself to the passengers, to the company, that they're 
[03:02:00]  like, well, don't sleep.  Well, the passengers, you can lie to them.  Got a little tired, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah, passengers, you can lie to them.  Yeah, just a weather diversion, the air traffic control problem.  Exactly.  Well, with these two, I guess the flight was barely an hour, and they slept for half of  it, or over half of it.  Yeah, they had to turn around.  I think it was like a 40...  Someone called and said it was only a 15-minute flight between the islands over there in Hawaii,  so...  Hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a real problem. 
[03:02:30]  Lee, we're really calling you because of stupid yes, once again.  Ah, bring on the yes questions.  You love yes.  Why do you love yes so much?  Well...  Just to bring everyone on board.  I think you had some kind of personal connection with the band back in the day, right?  Yeah, I did, but that was because of my love for them.  Now, I want to preface this by saying I thought the first two albums were interesting, but  the yes album, Fragile, Close to the Edge, brilliant.  That's what I loved. 
[03:03:00]  And then they kind of slid and lost track, and towards the end, I can't stand any of the  last 10 or 12 records.  They just blow.  Actually, you like two out of 14 records or two out of 16?  Yeah, I mean, they made such an impact on me, you know, personally with those three records  that, you know, I've just been a fan because of those.  And when they go on tour, they're smart enough to play songs from those three albums primarily,  which you're like, whoa.  So, it was just, I mean, they were just electric. 
[03:03:30]  A lot of people who have this, like, 80s owner of Lonely Heart or this pomp rock perception  of yes, if they listen to, like, the yes album, I mean, it was just pure power of telepathic  playing.  It was, like, cinematic.  It was just incredible.  Do you understand that what you're saying is, like, I'm a big MASH fan.  It's my favorite show.  But everything after season two sucked, right?  I'm kind of, I am saying that, yeah.  However, that season one was so impactful, so great that I forgive them for the rest of 
[03:04:00]  the stuff.  And it's just a classic, you know, I'm sure we don't have time now, but just, you know,  it's almost like Spinal Tappy, the way the band couldn't manage themselves and they were  all going in different directions.  But for that short period of time in, you know, the early 70s, they had, like, this Lennon  McCartney kind of magic going as far as, you know, working together and it all gelling  into this amazing sound.  Roundabout, is that one of your favorite songs?  Well, no, I'm kind of just, you know, that's reached the enough already stage. 
[03:04:30]  What's your favorite yes song of all time?  Starship Trooper on the yes album.  It's, I mean, really, I would encourage every listener to, you know, get it or find it and  just listen to it.  Or that or Yours is No Disgrace, also on the same record.  Yours is no disgrace!  You know, it's really powerful, just the playing, the precision, the production.  It's just...  They still tour?  I think it sounds as good now as it did then.  Yeah, I think so.  They still tour. 
[03:05:00]  John Anderson was doing some acoustic stuff out there at the CES in Vegas for everybody.  That's right.  Yeah, and it's actually their 40th anniversary this summer, so they'll be touring.  Hey, do we have Brian R. from Long Beach?  He writes, this was a good show, me and the Oprah and Anthony show today, but everything after  6.05 sucked.  6.05?  We started at 6 in the morning.  Yeah, I think he's being a little sarcastic.  Lee Abrams, uh...  Good thing we didn't have any Yes music.  I hope I didn't start anything.  One of the songs he was talking about. 
[03:05:30]  Uh, Butch, do you know Yes?  There, here you go.  There you go, Lee.  Huh?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Live!  I mean, it's live.  It's just like a tour de force.  It's powerful.  It's just electric.  Sounds a little bit like The Who.  Lee.  I don't even know The Who's stuff.  Lee, we did a bit today, just to kill about a half hour.  You know how it is.  You've been in radio long enough to understand that.  Uh, the top ten unnecessarily long songs.  What would you think is on this list? 
[03:06:00]  Well, I can sure think of some Yes selections, probably from the album Tales of Topographic  Oceans.  Uh, Revealing Science of God.  Holy, hold on!  What the fuck, Lee?  He is good.  That's the only Yes song on this list.  Really?  Uh, yeah.  And I'm like, there's no way he's gonna know The Revealing Science of God from Yes.  Yeah, oh yeah.  That, uh, there's, uh, that was a pivotal point in their career when it just kinda, you 
[03:06:30]  know, went from close to the edge to a little over the edge in a lot of people's minds.  What the fuck?  What's that song about?  The Revealing Science of God.  Uh, okay.  Come on.  He cleared that up.  The history of that is, uh, they were having these hugely successful tours, uh, and they  were pretty, you know, they were on a roll on a high, literally.  And, um, during like, uh, 73, I guess it was, on a huge tour of the U.S., and after the 
[03:07:00]  shows, you know, they were kinda low-key types.  John Anderson and Steve Howe, the guitarist, would go back to the hotel and kinda light candles  and incense, and they had the idea, uh, and a lot of it was, you know, we are more than  musicians, we are composers, you know, kinda gifts to your head.  And we're gonna compose this, uh, you know, this orchestral piece that, uh, isn't a single  album, isn't a double album, but three albums.  Mm-hmm.  And they wrote this based on, you know, kind of an obscure sort of Indian sort of scripture 
[03:07:30]  thing, which I don't understand.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  Anyway, and then they recorded it, and it really almost broke up the band, because, uh,  Steve and John were really into it.  Rick Wakeman just thought it was just ridiculous.  Yeah.  And, uh, the other two members, uh, the drummer and, uh, Rick Wakeman, uh, the keyboard player,  uh, the, uh, bass player, they kinda went along with it, but were highly suspicious.  And at the end of the day, you know, they realized it should have been just one album, 
[03:08:00]  uh, and Revealing Science of God should have been six minutes long instead of twenty.  And, uh, you know, for a real, real hardcore Yes fan who has the patience to sit down and  listen to it and analyze it and all that, you know, and it's a pretty moving experience.  But you gotta really be hardcore.  For the average person who's expecting another roundabout, they put this on and go, ooh,  God.  And to make matters worse, uh, when they toured...  No, you already have.  You sound like a real fan.  Wow.  What a great fan he is. 
[03:08:30]  It was the whole, you know, six and a half hours of Tales from Topographic Ocean sort of  back-to-back, and people were saying, gosh, we sure miss those shorter 11-minute songs,  like, you know, Years is Notice Grace and Roundabout.  Yeah.  So it was kind of a weird period for them.  I mean, again, it was, um, some say it was the beginning of the end as far because they  really went away from their sort of powerful image into this kind of cerebral zone. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Yes is one of those unfortunately named bands that really opens themself up to bad headlines.  Yeah.  Oh, they are.  Oh, they are.  Oh, they are.  Oh, they are.  They suck.  Oh, they hate things.  Yes.  I mean, some critics are, just point them out as, you know, just the death, the horrible,  just pompous, just garbage.  And other people, you know, think this is really magical-inspired music.  I tend to lean on that side.  But I certainly understand how some people, particularly in that era of yes, just wouldn't 
[03:09:30]  get it or, and, um, there you have it.  But I mean, it, um, it was an interesting time.  It was also a time when there was sort of an arms race going on for concept albums, you  know?  Yeah.  Oh, uh, Tommy by The Who, you know, well, that was great, but, uh, we can out Tommy,  Tommy, and so they tried to out Tommy, Tommy.  That's what it sounded, that clip that you just played sounded like Tommy.  That's what I thought. 
[03:10:00]  Well, they, uh, you know, yes, and The Who and all those bands sort of come from the  same, same school.  You saying cut from the same cloth, Lee?  Yeah, kind of.  Well, we, uh, we learned a lot about yesterday, more than we were going for, but, uh, thank  you, Lee.  Well, I would encourage people to listen to Starship Trooper, particularly with the lights  off.  Uh.  Why?  So you can't find the off button?  Hey, very good.  Thank you.  I was expecting a bigger response on that, but it got mediocrity at best. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  No, no, that was, uh, what was great about that was how quick it was.  That was...  Thank you.  Apparently not the same thing, though.  No, but it's a start.  You can learn a thing or two about quick, by the way.  Lee, I feel like you might be alone in a dark room right now.  Is that a presumptuous?  Hey, Lee.  What bothers me about Yes is that there was never a band called...  No.  No?  No.  No, however, if you'll remember their album, their big album of Fragile, which had Roundabout, 
[03:11:00]  Bachman Turner Overdrive did come out with a record called Not Fragile.  Ah.  Ah.  Of course.  Wow, they're tough guys.  Enough about Yes!  There must have been a hell of a time in music.  Yeah.  Boy, I tell ya.  Not necessarily long songs.  What's the number one, you think?  That's right up there.  Or pretty much anything on that album.  That was six.  That was six.  I was surprised that Alice's Restaurant wasn't on that list.  No.  No Alice's Restaurant.  Hmm.  Another...  That requires...  If I could call you back tomorrow, I could definitely have nine other ones. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, you'll Google them.  Google them.  Yeah.  Well, number one is Jethro Tull, Thick as a Brick.  Um...  Oh!  Oh, I know.  I actually kinda like this one, but it really is unnecessarily long.  But it is kinda, considering who did it and all that, and again, the time, it was kinda  cool.  But it was Interstellar Overdrive by Pink Floyd on Piper of the Gates of Dawn album.  That was, uh, uh, about the whole side of just kind of noise. 
[03:12:00]  But it was really cool noise.  Oh, the other one.  Metal Machine Music.  Um...  Where's he going?  This is amazing.  He's off-roading now.  I know, you're just fucking...  What happened?  He's spiraling.  Is that on the list?  No.  Which one?  I didn't even ask you one song.  Are you still on the radio?  Does anybody know?  No, he's still on the radio.  Good.  That is the best question I can be asked right now.  Metal Machine Music by Lou Reed.  Late 70s, I guess, probably 78 or so.  And, uh...  Yeah. 
[03:12:30]  It was just, uh...  Oh, I know another one.  Uh, it was just noise.  Uh...  Lou Reed stinks.  You do know that, right?  What's that?  Lou Reed stinks.  Yeah.  I can't stand Lou Reed.  What about the song he's doing with the Killers right now?  Is that good?  Yeah.  Tranquilizer?  Oh, my God.  Or Tranquilize?  I'm playing that now.  But the fucking colored girls go doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot.  Yes.  Awful.  Thank you for not even trying to sing, Lou.  There should be this, um, top ten overrated list.  I mean, Lou Reed, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, legend... 
[03:13:00]  Why?  Yeah.  I mean...  Why did Sabbath take nine times to get in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  And that shit stain gets in with one fucking spoken word thing with music behind it.  He's terrible.  Oh, that...  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it's such a joke.  It's the too cool for the ruined people.  But didn't he get in because of the Velvet Underground?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, they were huge, you know.  Right.  Oh, wait.  Another one, possibly, should be definitely on the list.  We didn't even ask you.  You know what he is?  He's fucking right now.  What the fuck?  He's Ralph Cramden answering the music questions after he got the first one wrong. 
[03:13:30]  He can't say Yakima.  Right.  Why are people spelling these names?  I'll be seeing you.  Yes.  No, wait, wait.  A lot of people don't call Roundabout.  This could be number one.  I don't know if you remember this one.  I already told you what number one was if you were listening.  Well, I know.  But this should be number one.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead, Lee.  Yoko Ono, The Fly.  Oh.  Which is, as I recall, 20 minutes of...  Wait, do we have The Fly by Yoko Ono?  What a dummy. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, we don't have it in Dillette there, Lee.  Thank God.  No, sure.  A lot of people are spelling your name with a lot of Z's at the end.  I don't know what that's called.  Oh, Abrams.  He doesn't even know it.  It's good.  What, Lee?  You started this whole trend.  I know what it's all about.  Sleeping and flying while under the influence of strange drugs.  Just...  No.  Lee's falling apart because that merge is going through soon, and he's just freaking out.  Yeah, everyone's freaking.  Lee, Jethro Tull, thick as a brick.  Thick as a brick. 
[03:14:30]  The original version is 43 minutes and 40 seconds long.  Right.  However, they did...  You know, that's an intro.  That should have a little asterisk next to it, because they did band it for radio.  Yeah.  So, you could play sections of it.  So, yeah, that's on there with an asterisk, I guess.  All right.  Really don't mind if you say...  It got me thinking.  Oh, Return of the Monster Magnet by Frank Zappa.  The version of the show is not being broadcast on XM.  It's on XM2. 
[03:15:00]  Like for Big Lee is in studio today there, Lee.  Wow.  And Pat from Wynaki making a military equipment joke.  Yeah.  He said, Abrams is tanking.  Tanking?  Yeah.  You have an Abrams tank?  And people are making their own list.  Oh.  Thank you.  It's a military equipment joke.  Yeah.  Oh, Pat should be run over by a tank.  Pat is a tank.  Run over his fucking thin...  How do you talk?  Why would I try to make a joke?  Why would I try to make a joke?  Don't write a heads to the podcast. 
[03:15:30]  Don't mean to interject.  You know, the Abrams tank is possibly one of the greatest tanks ever created.  Yeah.  Well, Steve has from Bashar's writing, Lee Ambience.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hey, wait.  Hold everything.  On this most long unnecessary song, there's a lot of these.  Again, these are things I like, but you've got to put them on the list.  But Tangerine Dream, some of that stuff that goes for 20 minutes is just trance. 
[03:16:00]  I like Tangerine Dream, actually.  I love them, yeah.  Well, the Allman Brothers is on the list with Mountain Jam.  You've got Pink Floyd, Allen's Psychedelic Breakfast, Rise and Shine slash Sunny from 1970.  Who wrote this list?  StarPulse.com, Lee.  Because Interstellar Overdrive should beat those.  Oh, really?  Well, the listeners are now making their own list.  It's called the Top 10 Unnecessarily Long Opian Anthony Breaks.  That's a hint.  Yes. 
[03:16:30]  Well, yeah.  Subtle.  You can't get it.  Lee got that, right?  Yeah.  You can't get one past this guy, huh, Jimmy?  Hits everything.  Picks right up on it.  Hits everything.  You understand that an hour after we get off the phone, he'll be having this conversation.  He'll be holding a receiver that's not even plugged in.  Right.  Just fucking talking into it.  And then there was the time.  Yes.  Have you ever put anyone to sleep in the tower when you're flying?  No, but that also, you know, there's a lot of investigation on, really, guys falling asleep in the tower. 
[03:17:00]  That was a plane to crash in Lexington.  Apparently that guy was sleeping most of the time.  Yeah.  You hadn't been flying through Lexington.  No, I hadn't.  Oh, okay.  I've been there many times, though.  I love this.  What I love about Lee, no matter what you mention, it's fodder for a speech.  That's the beauty of Lee.  Like, you'll say anything.  He's like, well, no, it's funny.  Like, he had been waiting to talk about this from me.  He has probably said, funny you should say that, 10,000 times in his life.  Yeah.  Absolutely. 
[03:17:30]  And then it leads to...  Funny you should say that.  Funny you should say.  Funny you should say.  Funny you should say.  Talking to Lee is like surfing the internet.  You just click and it just goes.  There's more information.  You don't quite know where you're going or where you'll end up.  Right now we're on horse gag.  It usually ends up with something that has to do with flying and sleeping based on the  time.  That's true.  Lee, anything else you want to say?  No, just keep up the great work and we should chat more often.  This is fun.  Yes, we should. 
[03:18:00]  Well...  Actually, Opie wants to go on a plane ride, right?  No.  No.  I thought you wanted to go to Dare County or something.  How about that?  Yeah.  Well, Lee does weekend trips and I hear they're a blast, but I'm too scared to fly with you.  Huh.  Did you see the video that our guy did of our pizza trip?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  It's fun.  Lee just wants friends, I think, Jimmy.  Of course he does.  Are you going to be Lee Abrams' friend? 
[03:18:30]  He's been on MySpace.  Oh, that's depressing.  I love Lee.  Lee, you know Tranquilize or is it Tranquilizer?  Tranquilizer by The Killers and Lou Reed?  Oh, right.  Yes.  For all the people that hate Lou Reed, I got a song for him.  Okay.  We're going to play going in a break.  I got to pee anyway.  Lee, thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  We'll talk soon.  Take care, Lee.  All right, Lee Abrams.  Bye.  The great Lee Abrams.  Music and radio.  Music, flying, radio. 
[03:19:00]  Music, flying, and radio, and where to get the good pot.  Yeah.  Just nothing about comedy.  We're timing.  We're timing.  Exactly.  Just trotting upon your lines.  That's all right.  He didn't mean it.  He doesn't know he's like a retard.  What does he know?  His fucking Wilford Brimley mustache.  Fucking pot seeds.  I got the diabetes.  Well, now they're coming up with the top 10 unnecessary births of all time.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Is Lee placing in that?  Boy, is he.

Triquilizer by The Killers featuring Lou Reed.  We're going to try to figure out this song as we go to a quick break.  but uh this ain't it how do you know 
[03:20:30]  this isn't the song no holy shit is it that's what it's labeled that huh this isn't the song

[03:27:00]  like they throw their guns down  and go like oh gosh  you got us now  oh you got us  we  we got uh  wouldn't that be the time  you go into panic mode  alright now  just start spraying  now  now i gotta go all out here  i gotta kill somebody  yeah  yeah but they they never did that  you know they'd make something out of a  friggin  right  air tank and some bolts  uh ed from texas  what's up ed  yeah hello  ed  hey sorry ed  sorry it's Andrew i guess you misheard me  oh 
[03:27:30]  what's going on  um  mr burbigler sir  do you still sleep in the sleeping bag  in the hotel room  that was actually what jim was referencing earlier  i only know that you do something on i have an interesting sleep thing he has going on  i have a sleepwalking disorder  i  i  it's dangerous  it's for real too  wait this is for real  yeah yeah  like when i  it's a big hassle  like i have my  i'm going to boston after this  and uh  i'm going to the train station  and like i have to bring a sleeping bag  and i you know i take pills 
[03:28:00]  i take a pretty heavy pill to sleep  because  i li  i literally  jumped out a window  sleepwalking  holy shit  i have like a serious disorder  i have  it's called rem behavior disorder  and it's a  it's a it's a disorder where people have a dopamine deficiency  it's a  it's the chemical that's released from your brain into your body when you fall asleep  so it paralyzes your body so that you don't do what's in your brain essentially  yeah that's where where you feel like you can't move  when you wake up with like that 
[03:28:30]  that buzzing feeling  where you're like i'm awake but i can't breathe or i can't move or i can't  that  that's called sleep paralysis  yeah yeah yeah  you can't get that  or you don't  no i get the opposite of that  wow  i like  action movies while you're sleeping  you wake up and you're singing there's no business like show business  holding a knife in the kitchen  well that people  people have actually killed like their wives who have what i have  you get off on that huh  you do i think  i think they'll let you off  and the cops come you just gotta go  what happened 
[03:29:00]  yawn  you learned that  you learned that one  ten years too late huh  hey  well  yeah i i i actually  it's funny because i jumped out of a second story window  three years ago  and i was i was in walla walla washington  i was uh i was doing a gig i was doing like six colleges in four days  it was like one of these  yeah  absurd things you're driving all over the state  you know and you're like i gotta make this money or else i'm not gonna be able to make 
[03:29:30]  you know it's you when you do these colleges it's like your rent for like six months  so i'm just like i gotta do it and i knew i knew i had to see a doctor you know i would have these incidents that were smaller like i would be at my girlfriend's house and we'd fall asleep watching the movie fight club and i had i remember i had this dream that i was the  you know the scene where edward norton's character's hand is held down by brad pitt  i never saw it  oh you never saw it  and he pours acid on his hand 
[03:30:00]  yeah  and i felt  and we fell asleep watching that and i had a dream that that was me and i sprinted out of the room  and i ran out of the apartment  uh down the hall and i threw a chest of drawers in my wake like i was in an action movie  uh so that brad pitt couldn't get me cause he's very cunning you know  he's very strong  of course he is  and i spring down the hall and i'm banging on the elevator thing  and my my girlfriend who's my girlfriend now she she came out and she's like 
[03:30:30]  mo that's what she called me  mo you're sleeping  and i was like  but brad pitt  oh shit  oh no  and you wake up  and i wake up  and i'm in the hallway  and fucking chest of drawers and it's like  and and her roommate  was furious  i mean she's like he can never stay here again  it was like a real  it was ugly  and so i  so a few days later i went to  and i at this point i was like you know maybe i should see a doctor  and then i was like maybe i'll eat dinner 
[03:31:00]  can i just  after this happens to you i would assume you would only watch g-rated movies  yeah  like movies of movies of uh i don't know people just petting like cute kittens or something  just why would you why would you ever see like a action movie ever again  my television only plays abc family  yeah  uh no but uh yeah in the daytime i like we saw no country for old men in the day  uh you know  she's a brave woman  yeah  but 
[03:31:30]  hey let's go take a nap  right after you see that movie  yeah  shooting bolts into her head  right  how long until you sleep all of a sudden does the problem occur  pretty fast like uh  about an hour in  i've gone i've stayed in the hospital uh overnight like many times for observation  they put the nodes all over you  yeah  and it's uh  and they  so they know exactly what i have and so i'm diagnosed  can we get uh lee aprons back on the phone  i'm gonna try this out  i'm gonna try this out  how cool would that be 
[03:32:00]  so uh you know  20 minutes into his dumb yes crap  there's mike stabbing people in his sleep  so that i guess the sleeping bag keeps you confined  oh yeah back to the  that's the idea it's like kind of like a straight jacket  i wear a sleeping bag with mittens  so i can't open the sleeping bag  you're kidding you sleep like that  yes  and you can fall asleep  who suggested this  yeah  my doctor  i have a sleep doctor  i mean just  if you want to hear a story  yes  this is fascinating  i was performing at these colleges 
[03:32:30]  uh  and i was uh  it was two in seattle  one in pasco  one in walla walla  and then one in portland  and  they  i did one in pasco  and then  uh  and one walla walla that night  and then afterwards  uh  you'd think i'd like  go to bed  but no  it's like  i'm on the internet  and i'm like you know  googling myself  you know what i mean  like  and you know i'm watching cable news 
[03:33:00]  which is insane you know  and i'm on the phone  and it's just like all this stupid shit that you're not supposed to do before you go to bed  right  and i fall asleep and i have a dream  i was at la quinta inn  but which is uh  people correct me when i tell the story they're like no it's la quinta  and i'm like that's not fair you can't force me to speak spanish  i didn't press two  but i'm at la quinta inn  and uh  in waya waya  and uh  i have a dream that there is a guided missile headed towards my room 
[03:33:30]  and there's all these military personnel in the room with me  and i and i jump out of bed  and i'm like what's the plan  and they say it's come to our attention the missile coordinates are set specifically on you  and i was like that's really bad  because i don't have a plan  yeah that's bad  so i decided in my dream  holy shit  it turns out in my life  to jump out the window  so that uh  i would detonate outside the window 
[03:34:00]  and save the platoon  and what a guy  i know  in my dreams i'm a hero  you're a hero  i woke up hugging a pillow  i would have grabbed somebody so i didn't go down alone  that's what we differ  but uh  and there's there's two details that are crucial for the story  one is that i was on the second floor  uh  two the window was closed  it was january  so i jumped through the window  wow  like the hulk  fucking roll  uh  and i i was like the hulk  and i always say that because that's literally how i described it at the emergency room 
[03:34:30]  because it's a hard thing to explain  you showed me the emergency room  fucking bleeding  you know  and i'm  i'm like you know  i'm like i'm like the hulk  yeah i just jumped out  you know  uh  and i i have this habit  in my life  preemptively shouting  when something traumatic is about to happen  like if someone is going to come up to me after a show  i don't know if you've had this before  where you say something that pisses somebody off  and you feel like somebody might punch you or something  oh yeah  my defense 
[03:35:00]  is to just  if that happens  just shout  just ah  thinking maybe they'll be like  this is weird  i'm out of here  you know  i don't want to deal with that  this fight's kind of gay  you know  so i jump through the window  and i scream  ah  and what's remarkable  and this is always hard to explain to people  because it's like  it sounds like i'm making it up  and i'm not  it's like  uh  people who have this disorder  are able to do things physically  you couldn't do  in your everyday life  because you have no inhibitions  you have no pain  you feel no pain  it's like getting drunk 
[03:35:30]  or blacking out  jump through the window  and  i landed  on the front lawn  of the hotel  and i took a spill  and then i kept running  and i'm running  and i'm slowly realizing  i'm on the front lawn  of la quinta in  in walla walla washington  in my underwear  bleeding  oh  god  and that's what you are  that's when you start realizing  drugs  what the fuck is going on  like you know  and i've in  it couldn't be a more obscure location  like i was just like 
[03:36:00]  like oh no  you know  and like  it was like one of those rare moments in your life  where in retrospect  you're like what the hell  and at the time you're like  i guess i'll continue  you know living  i don't know  like i guess i'll go to the front desk  and explain what happened  i went to the front desk  how do you do that  it was a tricky one  i went to the front desk  and the fortunately  the guy working the front desk  was mildly retarded  and what's funny is  i've actually  vouched for this  uh someone in washington recently 
[03:36:30]  when i was playing there  came up to me  they're like i know the guy  who work  who's working the front desk  or whatever  when you jumped out the window  and i was like  not to be offensive  but like is he like mildly retarded  and they're like yeah  yeah he's got issues  but anyway  this is not porn  but uh  i i walk up to him  and uh  it's three in the morning  the phones are ringing off the hook  from people staying at the hotel  who just saw the guy  jump out the window 
[03:37:00]  screaming  i'm bleeding in my underwear  and i say  running from missiles  you know  because you have to start somewhere  you know  and i was like  i'm i'm staying at the hotel  you know credibility  i i'm i had an incident where  i jumped out my window  and i'm bleeding  and i need to go to a hospital  and i'll never forget his reaction  because he just goes  huh  seen it all  that's the best thing  i could possibly get  as a response  seen it all at the la quinta  so i drove myself 
[03:37:30]  to the hospital  i got  uh  i the doctor put 30 stitches  in my legs  uh  and even  even he was like  uh  you should be dead  and i was like  no you should  all right  because i'm a comedian  uh  but uh  no broken bones  no  no  strangely  this happens a lot  where people  blackout drinking  they do shit  and you'd think they'd be broken  yeah they're in a horrific car accident  they're the ones that don't die  yeah 
[03:38:00]  it's the innocent bystander  yeah  that just got tapped in there  the drug driver's car  you can't  it's not even a car anymore  just wandering around the sidewalk  waiting for the police to show up  yeah  from personal experience actually  we've had many cars at our house  uh when i was growing up  and the drunks always survived  it was amazing to us  yeah  the car would be just nothing left  and they're just wandering around  yeah  looking up at the sky and stuff  i uh  yeah so i um  i got the stitches  and i mean just painful as anything 
[03:38:30]  just like getting like stitches in your in your legs  like you know it's like  how many gigs did you lose  i  what's amazing is  i was so poor at the time  that i was like  please tell me you performed the next night  i did  oh good for you  good for you mike  i drove to portland  i drove across the state  oh god  six hours  did the gig  no one had any idea  under my pants  of all these stitches  all fucking disgusting  and you know like  you know whatever 
[03:39:00]  yeah yeah  it's all like the  whatchamacallit  the stitches coming out of me  and uh  yeah  and i'm just you know i'm on stage  cracker please  you know who gives a shit  uh  but it's like  uh  but i'm just doing my thing  and like uh  and then i fly home and i went  i did what i should have done  like seven years before  when it started  you had some kind of thing going on  i went to the doctor  and uh  so now i sleep in a sleeping bag  what kind of pills have you taken  klonopin  which is pretty heavy  yeah i've heard of it  i don't know what it does  yeah  it's anti-anxiety 
[03:39:30]  mm-hmm  is it anxiety  were you like molested  like in the childhood that you know of  no i  i do have anxiety  i have that thing  i have  i don't know if you get  experiences  but i have like shallow breathing  where  when  i feel like i do too sometimes  yeah  where like if i get nervous  i'm just i'll  you know i just  i can't  i feel like i can't catch my breath  how'd you phrase it  anthony phrased it best  you can't feel the click  yeah there's almost like  it's supposed to be  at the top of your breath  like it feels right  yeah 
[03:40:00]  that's right  almost like all right  that was the most i could breathe in  now i gotta exhale  right you're always trying to catch that  yeah  but the i've talked to doctors about it  and the truth is you can't catch it  there's no such thing as catching it  like in other words like  you're you're supposed  you're really the best thing you can do  is wait for your breath to continue  because you will breathe no matter what  because your body wants to live  do you know what um  true  yeah  yeah  i had a doctor tell me one time  i went for that too 
[03:40:30]  because it drives me  i think it's it's definitely not a problem  my chest have an x-ray  or i had i had one one doctor tell me recently  you're a really heavy breather  like you breathe deep  you're a deep breather  i'm like really  i feel like i'm a shallow breather  she goes no no you're deep  you breathe really deep  she was doing like some kind of a thing  on my bladder  sonogram  so it turns out i breathe fine  um  but it's all on your head  or in my fucking  i think that i'm not filling up  but i am filling up  but she said my one lady told me  i don't i don't exhale enough  like i keep some in when i  instead of exhaling  no i exhale  but i still have air in there  so when i inhale 
[03:41:00]  i can't fill again  because there's still stuff  that i have on exhale properly  that's all it is  and and the worst part is that when you have it  the people are like  why aren't you breathing right  why aren't you breathing right  which makes you stop doing that  panic mode  right  you're freaking me out  a blue healer from kentucky  he's a regular he writes  plug him again i work in cincinnati ohio  i'd like to see this nutcase live  you can see mike march uh in cincinnati  march 20th through 23rd  at uh appropriately go bananas  in comedy club 
[03:41:30]  uh mike is brilliantly funny  but i suggest that you give out  uh the hotels you're staying at  yeah  just for the entertainment  and set up set up maybe lawn seats  yeah  no guarantees  but just set up lawn seats  outside your window  uh you will you know it's what's painful  about the whole thing is that mikey my  agent has to call has to call these  places ahead when i when i make sure  we can say  first floor  oh my god  and and for a while i wasn't talking  about it publicly  and and uh because i was you know i 
[03:42:00]  didn't want i was embarrassed that this  because it's a really fucked up thing  it's a hard thing to tell people and uh and  and he would call and be like mike has  to stay on the first floor and and they'd  be like why and and he'd have to cover  he'd be like because that's what mike  berbiglia wants  you know and so i'd show up and they  just hate me  yeah like this guy thinks oh captain  first floor like you know what he  should have said  fucking  there he is out there  on him he should have said something  like you know what it is  he uh he was in a place that was on a  fire one time and he has a horrible 
[03:42:30]  fear of fire that's a good one  so he has to be on the ground floor  that's a really good one i like that  because he was in a building that was  burning one time  that's a great one  but the typical agent because that's  what he wants motherfuckers  i see you know they're putting food  poison  exactly  they're just poisoning your food  and you show up and they think  you're this fucking holier than that  jizz bag with a fucking cute lighter  and you're just a nice guy with a  problem that you're trying to work  through  mike just wants to keep himself  right  right  just trying to save his own life  they're just giving you looks  the entire time in the hotel 
[03:43:00]  that's what my show's about  it's called sleepwalk with me  my next show  oh that's why that's interesting  alright now we bring it all the  way around  alright yeah talk about that  so that's what the show's about  and it's uh  it's basically  wait what show is it  it's called sleepwalk with me  oh one man show  i'm doing it off broadway  actually in may  ok ok  and uh  and so right now i'm workshopping  it and like  you know i tell that story  and basically it's about how  for like seven years  i knew i had this problem  and i just didn't want to deal  with it cause i was just 
[03:43:30]  you know  i it's weird when you have  something wrong with you  and you know what's wrong with you  and people are like you know  you should really get this checked out  and you're like  nah i'm really busy  yeah  you know what i mean  and it's like a colossal thing  and then in this case it's like  i literally jumped out a window  right  something that could kill you  but you're like  yeah  i'll find time  down the road  what is like the final thing  with like solution in a way  like is there uh  like will this make you better  the Klonopin  are they just like look  you're gonna have to deal with this  there is no solution 
[03:44:00]  that's the problem  except the final solution  that's the one i'm talking about  the Klonopin keeps you sleeping  for most of the night though  it does  the problem is  and this is the scariest part about it  is you know  there's connections with Parkinson's  once you get into the  once you get into the brain  problems with your brain  yeah  you don't want to read these books  you know what i mean  like you do not want to see what  it's like amazon.com  if you have this  you might also have this 
[03:44:30]  it's never something better  like if you have sleepwalk disorder  you may also have a bigger  than average cock  you should never diagnose yourself  on the internet man  just horrible things come up  it's awful dude  that's why i never watch  that's why i talk about it all the time  how i never watch hospital shows  doctor shows  or that god damn stupid fucking house  that show  house  i'm like oh no  do i have that  do i have like  fucking  bleeding out the asshole  you should never look online 
[03:45:00]  about what you have  no  the internet is uh  internet is a fucking  it's a infinite well of nothing  yeah  it's just there for really  the pornography  and uh  to send messages back and forth  easier than licking an envelope  yeah  exactly  i guess you're not allowed to fall asleep  on a plane i'm thinking  well i  i thought that  i thought that  you're gonna go for a joke  i'm thinking that  that would just be horrific  for everybody involved  well fortunately  my doctor said that  the Klonopin actually 
[03:45:30]  stays in your system  throughout the day  so she's not  against me taking naps  so i guess  it it it it carries her  and also you have a seatbelt on  do you think of doing this  might sound like an awkward thing  but on uh  tying i mean i know  might be  or you can fall but  tying yourself to the bed  like you don't want to jump up  like maybe your arm  not your foot  like instead of the sleeping bag  like you just tie yourself  so if you get up you're gonna  want to pull on the bed or  yeah i've thought about that a lot  the other one i thought about is  an alarm on my door 
[03:46:00]  you know like those security alarms  security alarms  uh so that something goes off  in the middle of the night  i would duck uh  duct tape my face to the pillow  so that's perfect  crazy glue  no think about it  and then you're lifting your head up  that hurts a lot  but shut up  but what if you just want to  toss them all out  you're finally getting a good night's sleep  and you just want to turn it over  to the other side  right i don't know  you gotta have a pillow stuck to your face  just stick one to each side  why aren't we making fun  we're not  i mean this is a serious thing  no no i'm fine with it  we don't know you well enough 
[03:46:30]  to actually you know beat you up  i mean if it was jimmy  we'd be all over this for hours  no i'll talk  i'll talk about this all day  it's interesting  it's a very interesting thing actually  it's gonna make a great one man show  is there gonna be jokes in this  yeah it's funny  it's funny  you're gonna have fun with it  it's really yeah it's actually  i think it's my funniest  show so far so  dude you're  that breathing thing fucking  i have the same fucking thing  i've had it for a couple years  you guys are very funny coming  i think we're uh  just about out of here  yeah  10.58  yeah  well mike you're gonna have to come back  we just wanted to get you in here 
[03:47:00]  and introduce you to everybody  yeah cool  thanks man  warm up to you a little bit  uh john mccain  we didn't even talk about that  oh yeah mccain  shocker  and i told anthony  that john mccain's gonna fuck up his own  his own nomination  i mean he's gonna get the  he has the nomination  but i mean he's gonna fuck it up  yep  and this is the first sign right here  what an affair back in 1999  yeah with some 40 year old uh  that's absurd  that doesn't matter  you're gonna tell me the fucking new york times  i'm sorry anthony you're gonna tell me the new york times didn't know about that before  of course they did  that's what everyone's saying  of course they did 
[03:47:30]  yeah  they were just waiting for the perfect time to bring that one out  you know what's great about it is  i don't know if you know this about john mccain  he can't put his own shirt on  his arms are really fucked up  you know he can't go any higher than his uh  shoulders  yeah so maybe  he wasn't fucking around with her  maybe she just  puts his shirt on  on the road  that's he  that's his shirt guy  or she raped him  and he couldn't tell her  he was trying to say stop  but he just moved on  go but  uncomfortable  awful arms  yeah you can't raise them up 
[03:48:00]  they just go out forward  that really gives me the creeps  just stop it  you were  poor guy walking through  walking through a crime ridden neighborhood  stick him forward  like an idiot  there's no substance to the claim whatsoever  i mean the article is literally just like  oh there's something going on  yeah  weird  i'm gonna try  i'm gonna plug uh  albany this friday  at the egg  jimmy  please come  total fucking non-entity  i don't draw in albany for shit  please go

[03:52:00]  so the chickens got out  and they're just  on the side of the road  just waiting for somebody  to rescue them  they don't understand  that they're going  to a slaughterhouse  they think they're being  driven to a carnival  or something  like will you fucking run  a chicken  they think they're being  driven somewhere comfortable  meanwhile there's fucking  30 per crate  right  they're all thrown in there  viciously  yeah they finally got room  but they can't wait  to get back in the crate  with their 30 friends  but they really think  they're traveling  to somewhere fun  like a chicken paradise  I hear they worship chickens

[03:54:00]  I love how I don't even  place on lines of the day  well  I don't even  I'm not even in the ballpark  of lines of the day  no you'd be surprised  we don't uh they just  they go behind the scenes  well I'll tell you what  happens with these assholes  they've stopped working  at nine o'clock  so all  line of the days  and the line of the days  all from the first half  of the show Mike  is he gonna believe that  no  here's your line of the day  light of the day  here  here  comes 
[03:54:30]  the  light of the day  the light of the day  light of the day  27 year old Kai se Fuller was booked for assault  and criminal possession of a  weapon  officers were called to Saratoga  Ave yesterday afternoon  and they say they found a man  outside bleeding  from the left shoulder  shoulder. And an ugly bitch holding a knife.  Exactly.  Wow, all the lines were from  earlier. From before 
[03:55:00]  9 o'clock. Proving my point.  Yep.  How long do you guys go on air?  Oh, it's too long. It's ridiculously  long. Sometimes more. Sometimes closer to  six. You should really come to the first part  of the show when we're awake. Yeah. Yeah, it's  an amazing radio show. Yeah, because you don't  curse a lot anyway. We can't curse over there, but you don't.  Mike is pretty... Yeah, we'll have you on very soon  if you would like that, Mike. Yeah, I'll come on.  How about tomorrow? I'll come on  for Caroline.

[03:56:00]  around town. You know, do the right thing here.  You know, if it was a $200 room and I  said, fuck it, you're putting me in an  $1,800 suite, but it was a $60  difference. It's mind-bending. He drives around  Newbury Street in a quarter  million dollar car.  Quarter million.  Wow.  I don't even know  how to pronounce it.

[03:56:30]  including all the music he was playing.  Good.  Did you hear us playing this at all, Mike?  Yeah.  You did, really?  Yeah, with the top ten stuff?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  This is an underground DJ from Vietnam.  Oh, okay.  He did 21 shows and then they shut him  down and he had to run away and then he  just left radio for 30 some odd years.  Wow.  And I found a tape and we've been playing  some of the breaks and we're going to do  the whole tape tomorrow.  For example, this is uncensored from  earlier.  Well, swingers, it's that time again 
[03:57:00]  for Pete and myself.  No, not the end of the program.  But both of us are getting kind of horny  and kind of hungry at that.  So we're going to go down the hall  and give us a big juicy twat burger.  So as soon as we go down and have a quick  bite to eat, a boxed lunch or something, 
[03:57:30]  we'll be back for another hour and a half  of hard-asset rock music.  We're now going to return you to the  regular crappy programming of the  American Forces Vietnamese Network.  Wow.  Amazing.  Yeah, fucking balls on him, man.  Yeah.  Just a high-tech.  The gigantic 69, Vietnam's only  psychedelic FM stereo multiplex station. 
[03:58:00]  James Gang.  S-T-O-P.  Which can mean stop or state tax on pussy.  Pussy.  Especially with the way things are so  restricted in the late 60s.  Like, can you imagine hearing this on the  fucking radio?  Oh, the soldiers must have loved this  fucking dude.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, the photo one.  This is what he said.  Just setting this up for tomorrow. 
[03:58:30]  We're going to do the whole thing tomorrow  at 10.15 in its entirety.  I've had a few requests for some pictures  of myself.  So some of you people wanted to hang  some on your walls or in the latrines  or something.  But to tell you the honest to God truth,  I have really no pictures of myself  that can be made into posters.  However, I do have one picture  that some of you might want.  It's a picture of myself  and my ex-girlfriend  going 69  in her bathtub. 
[03:59:00]  Now, if you'd like a copy of this,  which is blown up, by the way,  into an 8x10 glossy colored photograph,  just drop me a card  to Dave Rabbit  pornoffic picture,  poster,  APON country  96969.  And I'll try to get one  to you.  More music now.  Donovan.  Hurdy,  Gertie, man.  Huh.  Guy rules.  Yeah, he absolutely does.  And then one more  and then we'll get out of here for today. 
[03:59:30]  In answer to some of your questions  as what the bass commander thinks of me,  here are his exact words.  If I ever meet that son of a bitch,  I'm gonna walk up  and I'm gonna hit that motherfucker  right square in a goddamn teeth.  More than once.  Would you believe  that's what the bass commander  thinks of me and my nasty ways?  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  Fuck you, sir.  You noticed I emphasized the word sir.  He has an inferiority complex.  I mean, after all, 
[04:00:00]  anybody that dresses up  in women's dresses  and carries a velvet purse  has to be a little bit weird.  He's a classic.  So, tomorrow at 10.15  we're gonna head out early  and we're just gonna play  the Dave Rabbit tape  in its entirety  with the music and everything.  45 minutes worth of stuff.  Cool.  Yeah, I think that'll be really cool.  Mike, it was a pleasure, man.  Thanks, man.  This was a lot of fun.  I think you're really hilarious, man.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, this was a lot of fun.  Really funny guy.  Absolutely.  I'll come back next week  if you want to.  Yeah. 
[04:00:30]  Just come back.  I just changed the invitation.  No, I don't care.  We'll get you back.  We'll get you back soon.  Now that I'm thinking about it,  you guys,  what are you guys doing tomorrow?  We'll have you back very soon  and we'll do the other side.  That sounds great.  And we'll have some fun.  All right, guys.  We're out of here.  Rod and Fez, noon to three.  Yes, Jimmy?  Oh, nothing.  Just saying goodbye to the audience.  You'd never say goodbye to the audience?  I am today, though.  You usually have an ulterior motive.  No, no.  I just feel like I'm just friendly enough  in my greetings,  in my salutations.  Make it sincere. 
[04:01:00]  And the listeners.  Just the listeners.  What comes first,  the goodbye or the egg?  Ma-ha-ha-ha.  Speaking of the egg.  Ma-ha-ha.  It's funny.  Boy, am I going to lay one.  Fucking 300 people in the audience.  Fucking Albany cunts.  You're not going to sell tickets  calling them cunts, Jimmy.  How about this,  you upstage shit dicks.  Show up at my show  so I don't look like a fucking asshole.  I'm trying to look like I'm doing well.  You fucking state capital zeros.  That's a plug.  Exactly.  It's a plug.  Buy your egg tickets, faggots. 
[04:01:30]  I'm coming to town.  They're running to the box office  as we speak, Jimmy.  Or go to Ticketmaster,  you fucking broke zeros.  You got nothing better to do  with your shitty city.  Fucking Albany stinks.  Jimmy.  What?  You're going to be there tomorrow night.  No, I'm not.  Who's opening?  Friday night.  Who's opening for you?  I don't know.  It might be Marina.  I don't know.  I use different people.  It might be Marina Franklin.  Yeah?  Whoever it is.  Marina's very funny.  Whoever it is,  it's going to be a good show.  Doesn't sound like it.  Of course not.  You're yelling at the people.  Ah, fuck.  I'm what are a thousand people  going to run out 
[04:02:00]  if I'm nice to them?  It couldn't be any worse.  Fucking cocksuckers.  You might get a few  if you're nice, though.  I'm sure they're terrific.  Probably enjoying  some Canadian comedians.  Fucking assholes.  I hate Albany.  I hope I get there  and the egg is on fire.  They're all fucking burning in it.  You're hoping for a fried egg?  Exactly.  Or I get a chance  to fucking just go home.  Like, ah, well,  let's just take the tickets.  If that happens,  I'm going to use that  as my excuse in the future  for the first floor 
[04:02:30]  of the hotel situation.  There was a fire in the egg.  I did that Norton show  where there was a fire  at the egg,  so I got to stay  on the first floor.  I love the fucking egg.  I'd love to roll up  to the egg  and Kenny would go,  you know,  there's only a few  hybrid tickets, so.  He really is the worst.  Fucking, yeah,  well, get that smirk  off your dumb face.  He has no clue  how to make you feel good  and his whole job  is to try to make us feel good.  He's awful.  He just comes up with,  he just doesn't have  any class.  I hope I pull up  to the fucking egg 
[04:03:00]  and as he's telling me  that there's an explosion  and the fucking egg  just blows up.  That would make me  very happy.  Dude, you just reminded me,  so Kenny picks me up  this morning  and I planned  a weekend away,  kind of a special weekend away  at a place  that's really tough  to get to.  So I had to do this  in advance  for two or three months  and because of some stuff  that's going on  with Ant and I,  we had to cancel  this weekend,  okay,  which I was bummed at.  I'm losing my deposit,  it's, you know,  whatever,  and I really just wanted 
[04:03:30]  to go away.  So I've been going  back and forth  with Kenny,  so I tell him that,  good news, Kenny,  we could go away after all  because the thing  Ant and I have to do  has been pushed  a few weeks  down the road.  So I tell Kenny  this morning  at five,  excited,  I've been awake  20 minutes,  he goes,  you know it's going  to start snowing  in a few hours.  I don't know  if you're going  to make it up there.  Like, I'm excited.  I'm excited that this thing  is actually going  to happen  and he turns it  into, you know, 
[04:04:00]  it's going to snow.  Yeah.  You better prepare  for a lot of snow,  GH.  And he'll start,  like, I hate  when he starts,  he'll start fucking  bad-mouthing  somebody else,  like the club owner,  well, you know,  the club owner  should be paying you.  Right.  But you know,  people who are  that negative,  people who are  that negative,  like, all the time,  because I have  some relatives like that,  you know that  at some point  he's going to  break down  and be like,  I fucking love  you guys.  You know what I mean?  No, he means well,  Mike.  He'll have a moment  where you're like,  oh, he actually  meant well all the time 
[04:04:30]  that he was being  a douchebag.  He does mean well,  but he's too stupid  to realize,  so he'll just,  yeah.  He loves giving people  bad news.  Like, he was a cop  and we just know  he was the guy  that was like,  could I please go  to the next  of Kin's house?  Like, three in the morning,  there's just,  he's got teenager blood  all over him  and he's just like,  I'm sorry,  you're never going  to see him again.  Do you recognize  this hat?  And it's a fucking hat  with blood  and matted hair in it.  That's my son's. 
[04:05:00]  Well, that's all  that's left of him.  I'm sorry to tell you,  but I got it.  It's my job.  I'm sorry to tell you,  yet this smile  wouldn't indicate  that I'm sorry.  I figured you'd want  to bury the hat at least.  That's all that was left.  In the fire.  As you can see  by my bloody clothes,  I held him  until he died.  Oh, he's the fucking worst.  Jesus Christ.  Fucking gloom and doom, Kenny.  But the bit is,  he really thinks he means well.  But if there's three guys 
[04:05:30]  who do pitch-perfect  impersonations of him,  you know,  he does something right.  Oh, there's so much practice.  He's always saying  something stupid  or insensitive.  Oh, yes,  this is the fucking,  the grim raper.  But I couldn't wait  to share the news.  It's a dumb thing  that it could go away  after all.  Yeah.  Right away.  Well, it's gonna snow,  you know.  Yeah, he's just awful.  It's not even.  Well, that's kind of cool.  I, you know,  I know you want to get out.  Yeah, not that you leave  early tomorrow  so you can beat the weather.  It doesn't tell me  how much or when,  just that it's gonna, 
[04:06:00]  it could possibly be bad  for your nice little getaway.  What he should just do  is tell the truth.  I hope it snows tomorrow  so you're stuck here  so you can spend an hour  feeling like I feel  all the time.  That fucking,  Kenny is a fucking,  you know what he is?  He's a,  he's fucking leukemia  personified.  Personification.  Fucking bone marrow cancer.  Just trotting around  talking.  Kenny?  Yeah, was it bad  one time,  allegedly,  I might have went  on a sick call 
[04:06:30]  and the guy  died in his sleep  and they wanted me  to go in there  and like do CPR  and save him.  Yeah.  And like I just  took one look at him  and you know,  he was cold and stiff  and I came out  and the whole family  was out on the porch  and they go,  well, how is he?  And I just crossed  his name off  the mailbox.  Was that bad?  Oh my God.  You are the worst.  They probably thought  Kenny was in there  and they're thinking,  oh, there's a chance 
[04:07:00]  he might save him  and Kenny's just looking  going, oh,  this guy's gone.  He's so clever  with how he told us.  He is.  There was Mr. and Mrs.  on the mailbox  and I just crossed out  the Mr.  Yes, we get it, Kenny.  Yeah, we understood.  We didn't think you  scratched the whole thing out.  We figured.  Yeah.  I wanted to get  a second laugh.  Okay, well,  how about going  for a first one?  The fucking,  and here's the thing  about Kenny,  they probably like,  he must be in there  giving our dad CPR  and meanwhile,  he's on his cell phone 
[04:07:30]  with his foot  on the cadaver.  Well, Andrew has to  get a sweater.  He's not doing the game.  He used to be  Dice's road manager.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  In between going  to dead bodies  with his foot on the side.  Yeah, propping himself  up, tying his awful shoe.  Fucking.  On the cadaver.  Hoffman from Wackbag.  Opie, did you just say  Jimmy's going to be there  tomorrow night  and he responded,  no, I'm going to be there  Friday night.  I know, I fucked up.  All right, I'm sorry.  I'm blocking out the egg  like it's a fucking,  like it's an uncle  fingering incident. 
[04:08:00]  All right, Kenny,  you all right?  Yeah, I'm going  to my karate class  to beat some people up.  You get Jimmy's message?  About what?  On your phone  from earlier.  Oh, yeah,  why am I alive?  Yeah.  I got that.  But believe me,  it's going to be  a beautiful show  with the egg  and G8,  you're going to have  a wonderful weekend  to spice this house for him.  Let me explain.  There's no way  to sell that.  What Kenny does,  he can't help  but be a negative  and then he realizes,  wow, I'm being a little negative  so he tries to throw  a little sunshine on it 
[04:08:30]  but then it's too much.  You know, Jim,  I hear the governor's  going to come see you.  You know what?  You don't have to  overkill it.  Kenny's voice is like  when blind people  have those machines  where you type in the words  and then that's the voice.  That pops out.  I would like some eggs.  Yeah, the Stephen Hawking.  Yeah.  There's just no  robot voice.  There's no emotion to him.  He tries though.  Right, Kenny?  You guys had another great show.  I'm going to let you go  so you can wrap it up.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye. 
[04:09:00]  Bye.  I bet you whenever he hangs up  he's trying to be good natured.  I bet he just bites  his steering wheel  or he does something  really violent,  pulls out his pistol  and just looks at him.  Fucking creep.  You're a creep.  Are you listening right now?  You're a fucking creep  with a tan interior  or in your truck  you fucking lady.  Why does he have a tan interior?  Because he's a fucking lady.  Dude, I'm playing  this new bit with him.  We all know  if you hand Kenny something  especially if he has to drive  he started this with directions.  Let's say this is your 
[04:09:30]  directions to the gig, right?  Show Mike really fast.  He's upset.  He's OCD.  So he has to hold it  like in this sporty direction.  If it says take the turnpike  to exit one in Maryland  and you've just left  the Lincoln Tunnel  he'll keep his finger  on that next piece  it's like hey fuckhead  we have five hours.  Mike, you think you have problems.  I'm serious.  He does this  and then he'll just slowly  just move it down  to the next direction  and hold it there  until that is complete  all the way through  40 fucking steps.  And his eyesight stinks.  He refuses to go for an eye exam. 
[04:10:00]  Hey fucking  a tan interior  go for an eye exam  because he's the worst  you can't drive  I'm almost like  you're not going to drive  with him anymore  because literally at night  well let's go to that rest area  and he slows down  I'm like it's a mile and a half  you fuck.  Oh, it's hard to see  it's foggy.  No it's not  you have cataracts.  Oh, I was going to go there  you beat me to it.  But anyway with that  I got a new bit  like he's doing a lot of stuff  for us  so like things need to be mailed  or bills and stuff  whatever  so now I'm just handing him  a pile of shit in the morning  like take care of this 
[04:10:30]  and he refuses to put it  in the back seat  he is driving  and holding this stuff  at the same time  because for some reason  he can't put it down  and I don't get that one  He's afraid he'll forget it  he's afraid something  will fall into the seat  and get lost  he's just this weird  who knows why he does  what he does  he has a tiny head  I don't know what happens  He does have a tiny dinosaur head  He's the head of a leaf eater  Right  He really is  He's a fucking leaf eater  He cuts his hair short  and we're like  oh no  now you look like a pinhead  you gotta grow it 
[04:11:00]  to make it look like  you got more brain  than you really do  Exactly  balance it out a little bit  How did he end up  working for Dice  They met I think  in the gym or whatever  and Dice liked him  and kept wanting him  to work for him  because he's a cop  He's an intimidating guy  Yeah that's why  I met him at the Leary thing  that we did in Boston  Oh yeah yeah  Where I was just like  this is really scary  I mean what  what kind of situations  are you in  Well you never know  and he's armed  and he's a fucking martial artist  Kenny's a problem  I'll tell you why  he  why do I have to be  Greg Hughes  the actor that plays 
[04:11:30]  Opie on the Opie  Oh here he is  but I will  this is Greg Hughes  He's amazing  at his job Mike  Yep  Yeah  His job is to bring  misery and unhappiness  and he's fucking  amazing at it  The interior's tan  that's an uplifting color  How about  Mental Institution Green  were they out of that  and the black  you couldn't get  the black interior  Could you make  could you make it  so whenever it rains  they look like tears  He doesn't understand  what colors could do  to a  for a person  He refuses to beep  his shitty fucking horn 
[04:12:00]  Oh that is the worst  His OCD  he's only got  500 beeps in the thing  and he always keeps  the windshield wipers  until you literally  can't see  hey scumbag  we driving  we driving underwater  or are you being  a chiseler  with the fucking  windshield wipers  you shitting me  it's fucking  I've never  sea world  it's amazing  I've never driven  with him  he doesn't beep  his horn  no dude  you gotta drive  with Kenny  because he could  kill 99.99%  of the people 
[04:12:30]  that are  on the roads  and he lets  everyone just  abuse the shit  out of him  they cut him off  little tiny  little old ladies  are cutting him off  and he doesn't  fucking beep  he's like  oh look at this  I'm like  look at this  what am I gonna do  yeah  how about beeping  he doesn't beep  in the case of emergencies  he's awful  and I hate the way  he's saving the electricity  in his car  but he literally  will be like  you have to actually  lean over and go  how about fucking  hitting the switch  so we can look out  in front of us  and see if anything  has stopped  I fucking hate 
[04:13:00]  your chiseling  with the fucking  windshield wiper  distribution  just turn it on  he doesn't  he doesn't want to use  is it the electricity  or the wiper blades  whatever  stop saving everything  when he dies  I hope they put him  in a coffin  with two fresh wiper blades  and a fucking  unused horn  like a pharaoh  and enough  I could use these  in the afterlife  exactly  and enough  with your fucking  invoices  just round it off  and how about  he sends invoices 
[04:13:30]  every month  because he buys  like breakfast  and stuff  and you're like  75 cents  for a cup of coffee  87 cents  for a yogurt  I mean just  the dumbest shit  he's like Scientology  he just buries you  in paperwork  he's charging me  for the same month  8 times  and I paid for bananas  like 5 times  I just can't look anymore  the details  ridiculous  and his fucking  obsessive emails  how about one  at the end of the day  just sum it up  right  a single bandaid  for GH  22 cents  you know what
