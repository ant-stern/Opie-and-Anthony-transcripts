<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of Todd's new solo morning show on 95.5 PLJ, following Scott Shannon's departure from the Scott and Todd show.  The hosts played several clips from Todd's debut, mocking its overly dramatic and self-aggrandizing style, its cheesy jingles, and its bombastic tone.  They also ridiculed the bios of Todd's new staff, particularly "Meatballs," whose bio was described as outlandish and humorous.  Chelsea Handler's upcoming appearance on Todd's show was mentioned.  The hosts' commentary was irreverent, sarcastic, and heavily laced with vulgar language and sexually suggestive humor.  The discussion also touched on Jason Collins' coming out, with the hosts expressing dismissiveness toward the media’s reaction.

The show continued with a discussion of "The Todd Show's" initial reception, noting the lack of enthusiasm surrounding a planned "Todd van" promotional stunt and critiquing the show's initial segments, including a phone scam bit reminiscent of their previous show.  They introduced new staff members, Anne-Marie Leamy (described with sexually suggestive language) and Sheila Watko (whose bio mentioned defecating in a skillet), along with Bill Fitzpatrick.  The hosts heavily criticized "Meatballs’" assignment to convince Alec Baldwin to stay in New York City.  The hosts monitored the hashtag #TheToddShow, noting the largely sarcastic and negative comments from Opie and Anthony listeners, including explicit images.  A detailed discussion followed about a disappointing group photo shoot and the negative listener feedback to the phone scam bit. They noted that #TheToddShow was trending nationally, despite being a local show, even showing a picture of an anus as an example.  A discussion about *The Wolf of Wall Street* and a parent's experience watching it with a child also took place, before concluding with the hosts reacting to a carbon monoxide poisoning incident at a local mall.

The next segment focused on Alec Baldwin's decision to leave New York City, discussing his essay criticizing the media, acknowledging its well-written nature despite its length and Baldwin’s potentially contributing behavior.  They criticized various media personalities including Rachel Maddow, Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, Anderson Cooper, and Harvey Levin, and discussed Baldwin’s offensive language toward a TMZ reporter.  A significant portion detailed "Meatballs’" inept attempts to convince Baldwin to stay, including forgetting bribe money and delivering a poorly conceived chant.  The hosts discussed the quickly deleted #TheToddShow hashtag due to inappropriate user-generated content, played audio clips of a news reporter being interrupted with profanity during a live shot, and played an awkward Olive Garden phone scam bit from "The Todd Show."  The segment concluded with updates on "Meatballs," and a further discussion of the trending hashtag, featuring UFC fighters Uriah Hall and Demetrius Johnson (who were in-studio).

The final segment featured MMA fighters Demetrius Johnson ("Mighty Mouse") and Uriah Hall (in-studio).  The discussion began with cauliflower ear and a gruesome Kimbo Slice fight, moving to the physical and emotional tolls of fighting, using examples like Ronda Rousey, Misha Tate, and Anderson Silva.  Hall described a fight where he made Chris Leben quit.  The conversation shifted to the NFL's proposed 15-yard penalty for using the N-word, sparking a debate about its practicality, fairness, and hypocrisy, discussing the word's prevalence in the NFL and the potential backlash. The segment concluded with plugs for the fighters' Twitter accounts, promotion of Jimmy's comedy shows, a brief discussion about Mayim Bialik and a caller's negative SiriusXM experience, and comments on Al Sharpton’s hypocrisy regarding offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do it.  Good morning, everybody.  Here we go.  Time for a little radio.  Hope everyone had a good weekend.  Oh, indeed.  E-Rock has been working on a little something.  A little something something.  Should we play this right away?  I'm just making sure it works.  Oh, you're just making sure it works?  E to the R.  Congratulations on Friday, E-Rock, turning that situation around. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  People, wow.  E-Rock turned that situation around.  What a reaction from the audience.  They loved it.  They absolutely loved it.  I'm not going to explain it now.  Just start listening to the show longer.  What's up on Opie Radio?  Oh, nice and early.  This is going to be a good week.  And whenever you want to get to that disc,  whatever we thought we might have lost for Justin,  October, we've gained back his feet. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, man.  We have so much to do today.  Wow.  But it came to my attention as soon as I walked in today that,  remember that old Scott and Todd show?  Yes.  I certainly do.  Where Scott Shannon, out of nowhere, retired.  Retired.  I think he was forced out.  Jason Collins is gay.  Who gives a fuck?  What a fucking non-story.  I was listening on my way into that.  I bet you the rest of the gay NBA players are kind of pissed off.  Yeah.  They've been playing for years. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  I would say there's at least another two dozen gay NBA players.  I would say almost one per team.  People are fucking ridiculous.  What the fuck?  He is the first openly gay player in any of the four major North Americans.  Oh, shit.  He gives a shit.  Is he a popular player?  He's at peace.  With the guys.  Well, after, hubba hubba.  He signed a 10-day contract.  He's on the fence as far as the NBA goes.  10 days? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  I don't know the game.  I could do that.  The Nets signed him to a 10-day contract, I believe, right?  Yeah.  10-day contract.  Here's Jason Collins checking into an NBA game and history.  What's history?  Shut up.  Who cares?  He's got the gay face.  He does have the gay face.  We had a guy who used to work for us.  He was convinced people had the gay face.  That's too long to explain to him.  Oh, yeah.  You know.  But Jason Collins, congratulations, I guess.  Hey, congratulations.  I guess.  You like to be with men, and you play basketball. 
[00:02:30]  Basketball.  Wow.  Wowie Kazowie.  Who cares?  This whole gay thing is really fucking ridiculous.  Why does he have his finger like that, though?  Is he looking for a hiney hole?  Oh, boy.  That's not nice.  Why is he checking into the game like that?  I don't know.  Is he ready to put that index finger in a hiney hole?  Oh.  Because he can't help himself?  Because he's gay?  Is that what happens?  If you're gay, you can't help yourself?  You've got to try to find hiney holes all the time? 
[00:03:00]  That seems to be how important the media makes it.  Oh.  Boy, how does he even have time to try to play the game when he's too busy looking for hiney  holes all the time?  Our country is fucking ridiculous.  Just ridiculous.  It's a non-story.  Right.  Be gay.  Play a game.  Whatever.  Who cares?  Jason Collins becomes the first openly gay athlete to enter a game of football, baseball,  hockey, or basketball.  But didn't that college student just come out? 
[00:03:30]  He's not a pro yet.  Oh, he's not a pro.  I don't know.  It's like, who can get in there the fastest and be the first?  Right.  And who was the guy last year?  There was a guy who came out and came out of the closet to his...  Guess what?  I don't know.  Who cares?  Because who gives a fuck?  Because who gives a fuck?  But you're right there.  I don't know.  You remember what I mean, right?  Last year the guy came out and...  Yeah.  Well, this guy came out, but he wasn't on a team at that time.  It's not quite Jackie Robinson.  Oh, is this who it is?  This is the guy?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Now he's officially, you know, gay in the NBA. 
[00:04:00]  When he came out, he was just gay because he wasn't in the NBA.  Yeah.  Now he's gay in the NBA.  So, there you have it.  Oh, all right.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  But it's the front page of the paper.  Come out and play.  Get it?  I get it.  Come out and play.  Nice.  Like, come out.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, boy.  Where were we?  Oh, so, remember the Scott and Todd show with Scott Shannon?  Oh, yeah.  Who was a staple for our Jocktober, this Scott and Todd show. 
[00:04:30]  Certainly is.  So, they forced Scott Shannon out, I think.  I don't think Scott Shannon's going to retire, even though he probably should.  Maybe he should, but I've heard some rumors, yeah.  I bet she probably ends up here.  Who knows?  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Who the fuck knows?  Imagine him walking through the hallways here.  Right.  Hey, how you doing?  Yeah, we'd probably get along with him.  People think someone's stealing a stone figure.  Who has a stone figure?  Wheeling in another decoration for the lobby. 
[00:05:00]  Anyway, Todd started his solo show today.  Oh, good.  Oh, wow.  And the douches are aplenty.  Oh, are they?  Oh, boy, are they.  This sounds great.  We could start with this, but we've got lots of other things to do.  I would love to just hear some.  I've got to hear some.  I just want to talk about this until about 10.10.  That's all I want to do.  Yes, exactly.  Just a couple minutes.  All right.  Well, we could get right into it, then. 
[00:05:30]  Whoa, whoa, what happened?  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  What do you got on this?  I forgot about the possibility of calling it the Todd Show.  Right.  You know how to say you put pre-recorded little bits?  Like, we have the ONA podcast.  Yes.  If you say he has a Toddcast, I'll rip your hair out.  Oh, no.  I'm not going to continue my statement because I'd like to keep my hair.  He's a Toddcast.  He's a Toddcast.  Every morning, you're going to get Toddcasts.  Whoa.  Nice. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, and look.  Look at his pic.  He's gotten younger.  He's got spiked up hair.  He's got his shirt unbuttoned a little bit.  Oh, no.  No problem.  And look at him.  Like, he's got three chicks and three guys.  Just in a New York City apartment.  Like, you know what?  Like a loft.  We go behind the scenes for the photo shoot.  It's supposed to be like a bunch of young, fun people.  And I'll say the girls do look quite young and fun.  Mm-hmm.  Looks like they're, like, on the set of Friends or something.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Do you like his wristband?  Oh, God, no.  I don't care for that either. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, that's dope.  Yeah.  Anyway.  We have to take the picture from far away.  I'm Mr. Older Than I Should Be, Winkles, young station.  Eric in Boston is pointing out  that, hold on, before we move on  from Jason Collins, he's got  a good little line here. Eric in  Boston, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to point out that you can tell this is a marketing  ploy by the NBA.  When they sign this gay guy 
[00:07:00]  to a contract that's only eight days  longer than they signed the kid with Down Syndrome  last week.  That is true.  There you go. Bravo.  Good job, Eric.  Hey, look at the cast of characters.  Meet the personalities.  You got Todd, you got  Monk, Cooper, Annie,  Meatballs, I bet you he's the crazy  guy.  Who invited Meatballs?  What are you doing, Meatballs?  He's the stunt guy. 
[00:07:30]  Of course he is.  Here, let's see  Meatballs' bio.  Let me get this guy.  What's his bio say?  Well, Meatballs was born in Philadelphia  to two wonderfully  unsupportive parents  who to this day...  I love a good radio bio.  They think nothing he does is ever good enough.  Maybe that's why they named him Meatballs.  Ah.  He was a graduate of  high school, Philly suburbs,  where he was an avid collector  of Pokemon and Beanie Babies. 
[00:08:00]  Who doesn't remember the 90s, huh?  Ah, come on, right?  I can relate.  Since he...  Oh, this is a good one.  You're going to like this, Jim.  Since he was a tiny Swedish meatball...  Because they're smaller.  I get it.  He always loved theater.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  A bit mysterious.  A mystery going on there.  A little mystery going on.  Oh, meatballs across the nose.  Meatballs with a hot dog between them. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, the theater.  Having been in several amateur  and professional productions  in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New York,  Meatballs considers himself  a leading man with dramatic tendencies.  Dramatic tendencies?  That's what it says.  Oh, they must have made a last-minute switch.  Yeah.  After high school Meatballs audition 
[00:09:00]  was selected,  one of ten people nationwide  to have a scholarship  to the Brooklyn Musical Theater program  where he got a BFA,  which he turned down  because he thought he had found  the sauce to his meatballs.  Was it white on his back?  Some Alfredo.  Yes.  Alfredo.  He loves the Alfredo in his meatballs.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, geez.  So he stayed home with his sweetheart.  No name?  They're being nonspecific.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Yes, sweetheart.  All right.  All right.  And he went to Temple.  He got a degree in journalism  and realized he hated journalism.  He wanted to entertain people.  Meatball is an avid elementary school sports fan.  Oh.  That's funny.  Most people like college or high school even.  That's pretty clever.  Yeah.  It is?  Yeah, that's pretty clever right there.  All kinds of play tackle.  Instead of saying, yeah,  like college football or...  Right, right.  Elementary school.  NHL hockey.  That's pretty clever.  And if he's not working really hard... 
[00:10:00]  That was in caps.  Uh-oh.  ...on the Todd Show,  he can be found at local t-ball and kickball games,  as well as pee-wee football practices.  All right.  We get it.  Yeah.  You don't have to hammer a dumb joke.  Now it just gets creepy.  How about Little League?  Yeah.  Watching toddlers in tiaras.  He likes to smell bassinets when they're empty.  Don't you get asked to leave those games  if you don't have a kid participating?  Pretty sure.  Yeah, pretty much.  Meatball has only been arrested three times  for fighting fans of opposing teams. 
[00:10:30]  Still going with this joke, huh?  He's still going.  Twice in one day at the New York City Borough Kickball Championships.  A bogus claim.  It still does.  He still defends to this day.  What?  We got it.  All right.  Is that it?  That's...  Yeah.  All right.  I wouldn't even read any of the bios.  No, that's the best one right there.  It probably stinks.  Does Todd mention anything about disloyalty?  Well, Todd isn't there.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Todd hasn't written up his bio yet? 
[00:11:00]  No.  His bio's not there.  I like how they couldn't afford Scott,  but they could afford four more people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They wanted to young up the station.  That's what they do.  They certainly did.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Look at Cooper and fucking Annie is hot.  Cooper and Annie are hot.  You've been in radio for a long time.  Anything Meatballs was an expensive get for them.  Oh, boy.  I think he might have been an intern.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that does have an intern written all over it.  How old are Cooper and Annie?  Sorry.  How old are Cooper and Annie?  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  They're actually cute.  They had some...  They're probably like...  Let me see.  That's late 20s right there.  Where is Annie?  Let me see Annie.  Hey, Coop.  Looking late 20s.  Maybe early 30s.  Maybe early 30s.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Let's see if I were...  I think it's Annie.  I think she was a page.  Yeah, she's pretty cute right there.  Sure.  I'll take her out.  She loves everything pop culture, family, and a good old-fashioned Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.  Maybe I won't.  She'll do the entertainment report, I bet.  She goes on.  Well, Todd.  Yeah.  Did you hear what happened? 
[00:12:00]  Alec Baldwin is talking about...  Oh, boy.  That guy's going crazy.  What's going on there, Annie?  That look cool.  Baldwin, isn't that just a town in Long Island?  I don't know what's going on.  That's funny stuff, Todd.  Save it for the Toddcast.  Hey.  Hey, Meatballs, what are you doing over there?  He likes theater, this guy.  He certainly does, Todd.  What, did you get thrown out of another Little League game or something?  Go ahead.  That's funny.  20 minutes on it. 
[00:12:30]  Go.  We have to play this.  I know.  Now we have to.  That's funny.  His impression is, wait till you hear the dramatic open of the Todd show.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The dramatic opening of the Todd show.  Oh.  Signs, Scott.  No, Scott.  No, Scott.  You ready for this?  Yes.  Oh, am I ever.  Oh.  Oh.  Beep.  Beep.  Oh.  Beep. 
[00:13:00]  Oh.  This radio station has been home to some of the greatest broadcasts in the history.  Hold on.  Who is this?  I don't recognize this person.  This is Todd.  Who is this?  This is Todd.  This guy's voice is so fake on the air.  It's like fucking latke and Vic Ferrari.  Who are you?  This guy was talking.  Yeah.  I could listen to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because it's a regular voice, kind of. 
[00:13:30]  Regular radio voice.  Yeah.  There's a post on their Facebook page that says, coming up at 7.15, Chelsea Handler calls Todd  and the gang.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there's one comment on it.  It's left by a user named Junior Mint.  Oh.  Which is the name of my college ill-fated rap group.  Right.  And it's a photo of E-Rock.  E-Rock.  It's just a photo of E-Rock.  E-Rock looking a little dreamy in that photo.  Yeah.  He's got his bedroom eyes on in that one.  A little dreamy.  Like he did within the Lindsay Lohan picture.  Yes. 
[00:14:00]  Are you ready for this?  Oh, yeah.  It's just a dumb radio show.  This is so dramatic.  There's another Junior Mint is leaving another.  It's a photo of Meatball and his landlord.  Right.  And the only comment is a photo of intern David with a mustache.  Oh.  And before any listeners start going, we like your intro is intimate.  If you don't understand sarcasm in our intro, the difference between Todd's dramatic intro  and our dripping with sarcasm, self-fucking... 
[00:14:30]  You don't even need to justify it.  The O.B. and Anthony show doesn't suck.  Well, that's true, too.  But you're really selling us, Sam.  That should be how we sell this program.  It doesn't suck.  We don't suck.  Dot, dot, dot.  All the time.  Yes.  Here we go, boys and girls.  ...has been home to some of the greatest broadcasts in the history of our industry.  The ghosts of legends walk these hallowed halls.  Ah!  Did someone write that? 
[00:15:00]  That's like a Bob Costas thing.  That's terrible.  What are they talking about?  The ghosts of legends.  Yeah, like fucking...  Like Scott.  Yeah, Scott Shannon.  Like Scott Shannon's ghost that you summarily threw out of the building.  You exercised his spirit from the building, the hallowed halls.  Now, WPLJ's been around forever, right?  Mm-hmm.  It was around when we were growing up.  Yeah.  Who are the legends from WPLJ?  Carol Miller was there. 
[00:15:30]  Rocky Allen.  Rocky Allen was there.  Come on, legends.  These are legends, though?  All right, maybe not.  Or just, you know, good broadcasters.  Just people that...  Yeah.  There's the guy Todd threw out on his ass.  Ah, that guy.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  Shannon.  Good, uh, yeah, yeah.  Hallowed halls.  This radio station has been home to some of the greatest broadcasts in the history of  our industry.  The ghosts of legends walk these hallowed halls, and the whispers of greatness can be heard  at every sunrise.  Yet there are some people...  I can't do this! 
[00:16:00]  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, is this douchey?  The whispers of greatness...  I've got a train on my house.  Sun's coming.  I've got a train on my house.  I want to see the boat moving.  I'll be telling him how to...  What is he doing?  My name is Lester Merkle Herkle-Ferkle.  Just start the new fucking show. 
[00:16:30]  Will you shut up?  Can't print out, but they can, can, can.  Oh.  ...and be heard at every sunrise.  Yet there are some people who say that what we're attempting to do can't be done.  That you can't save a dying industry, or reinvent a medium whose time has seemingly passed.  They believe that satellite and digital radio have already robbed us of our audience, and  that our best days are behind us.  And I've got news for you.  Uh-oh.  These battle-tested microphones could tell a thousand stories. 
[00:17:00]  Ah!  Battle-tested microphones?  What?  We are beating Scott over the head with a...  Yes.  These microphones would smell like cum for some reason.  After our stunt boy has been breathing into them.  This is so bad.  This is terrible.  He's trying to make this dramatic point.  He's not going to be able to do it.  No.  He's not a revolutionary.  No.  This is so bad. 
[00:17:30]  He already was in control of the Scott and Todd show.  Yeah.  What is he talking about?  I don't care how many people I have to throw out of this, the hallowed halls.  Now, you might not recognize the person that talks for the other four hours of this radio  show, but it is indeed me.  Oh, God.  This is so embarrassing, man.  Battle-tested.  This is bad.  Battle-tested microphones?  What battle?  What battle?  What battle?  You can't take...  If you're behind one of these dopey things, you can't take yourself seriously. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, no.  This is a joke in the end.  Oh, God.  Not testing battles or battle-testing.  This is a goof.  Hopefully, you say something funny or maybe thought-provoking, and if you don't, ah, what  are you going to do?  There's always tomorrow.  Right.  We're not battling.  You don't think he's, ah, you don't think it's a battle-tested...  Oh, God, no.  Do you think there's whispers of greatness in that hallway?  No.  In the sunrise?  Oh.  Wow, is this douchey.  The mellow drama of this box. 
[00:18:30]  Oh.  It's so bad.  Oh, it's not even half one.  Oh, no.  Actually, thank God.  I want more.  Wow, I want more, too.  This was a huge find by Eric this morning.  Yes, of course.  These battle-tested microphones could tell a thousand stories, but none greater than the unwritten  story about to be told.  And I make you this promise on the 24th day of February 2014.  Ew.  I say to those people and others like them, you are wrong.  Oh.  And here's why.  As I speak to you just...  You were right, Rupert. 
[00:19:00]  And we were wrong.  First of all, whenever you list the dates...  Yes.  ...by saying whatever, the such-and-such date on that, you're an asshole.  Who are you, fucking Charlton Hester?  We list the date every once in a while.  Oh.  Just so these idiots don't go, oh, are these assholes off again?  Exactly.  When we say February 15th, hey, it's July 8th.  The 15th day.  Yeah.  In the year of our Lord.  Yeah, we don't say it like that.  It's the 22nd day.  I say to you... 
[00:19:30]  I sayeth unto thee...  Fucking wait.  Let Ben Hur continue this.  Really important stuff.  Go ahead, William Wallace.  Sorry, I couldn't hear you.  Shit.  As I speak to you just after 6 a.m. on a typical Monday morning,  somewhere out there is a mom who's been up all night with a sick kid.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  He's going to try to...  Oh, this is so bad.  I can't...  Oh, no.  I hope a kid's blue.  And it's not breathing. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, my God.  She needs paint for that room.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  And she needs a friend to get rid of that new crib.  Oh, no.  I don't know where he's going with this.  There's a mom.  Oh, and he's going to make it all better for her.  Is that where it's going?  I've been up all night with a sick kid.  Uh-huh.  And guess what?  You don't want...  I don't think about a radio show to get me through it.  You're yearning for Todd?  God, no.  What is he doing? 
[00:20:30]  What's happening?  There's a Photoshop on their Facebook page.  Uh-huh.  And it's a photo of Liberace and Scott Thorson.  Right.  Except it's Dennis Falcone instead of Liberace and myself instead of...  Look at that.  You kind of look good in that role, Sam.  Yeah.  Maybe we've got to get you that little uniform that Scott used to wear.  Tuck that ridiculous hairdo into your hat.  This is a big day for the Todd show, man.  You're right.  I don't know why their listeners are getting weird on the Facebook page. 
[00:21:00]  That's 6 a.m.  That's really strange.  Oh, marking the time and date.  Like history is going to...  Like fucking Roosevelt talking about the day that will live in infamy.  So a mom's up with a sick kid and then what?  She turns to laugh or something?  She turns on the Todd show and everything will be okay now?  Just a little smile.  Is that how this radio thing works?  Yeah.  Just a little smile.  Who's that?  Steve Blatter and two...  That's Steve Blatter? 
[00:21:30]  ...of Shade, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who is young?  It's very young, Steve Blatter.  He works here doing something.  Oh.  I'm quite sure.  Okay.  Have we met him?  He actually used to...  Yeah, he used to run the channel here.  Oh.  Yeah, this channel.  Ready?  Oh, God.  Oh, Jimmy.  That's not me.  That's more of the speech.  That's the sick kid that the mom's up with.  He made a bubble in the script.  He has a tummy ache.  His belly hurts. 
[00:22:00]  As I speak to you, just after 6 a.m. on a typical Monday morning,  somewhere out there is a mom who's been up all night with a sick kid  or a dad who's coming home from his second job  who just wants to take a minute to laugh.  No, no.  He wants to go to fucking bed because he's exhausted.  He wants to fuck his wife, maybe.  Yeah, he wants his wife to wipe the sick kid shit off her hand and suck his dick.  Right.  He wants his fucking dirty night watchman asshole eaten before he fucking dozes off. 
[00:22:30]  He wants to laugh.  That's way down on the list of things he probably wants to do.  Right?  Jesus.  Unless he's listing reasons why they will not be listening to his show.  Yeah.  That's why they go to Satellite or somewhere else.  Self-important jizz.  Ha, ha, ha.  ...night with a sick kid or a dad who's coming home from his second job  who just wants to take a minute to laugh with someone who feels like family.  Oh.  I believe they want to know that the people in this room feel what they feel,  live what they live, and see what they see. 
[00:23:00]  And he can't do that in some windowless, colorless, passionless, makeshift studio that used to  be a coat closet.  I, for one, don't believe that the people of the tri-state area want to listen to some  dillweed who doesn't know the difference between a TV show and the real Jersey Shore.  What?  Oh, God!  Wait, what?  You never say dillweed.  A dillweed.  Stop trying to sound younger.  No young person even remembers when people said dillweed. 
[00:23:30]  Said dillweed.  Do you understand that?  I am cringing.  This is what stupid regular radio does.  It's like, they can't compete.  If you've got a good, solid show with good personalities making you laugh and shit,  they think they could compete against that by being local.  Right.  This is a local thing, guys.  Hey, look at that.  So, basically, he's saying, look, we know the real Jersey Shore.  Yeah, not just the TV show.  Not the TV show that no one talks about anymore, by the way.  It's a horrible reference. 
[00:24:00]  It's a relevant reference.  He's awful.  And you stay up at night, you want to know who shot J.R.  J.R.  You idiot.  Wow.  They know the real Jersey Shore, guys.  Some dillweed.  Some dillweed.  Some dillweed.  The way he said, some dillweed.  Right.  Look out.  Whoa.  Hideous.  There's some dillweed who doesn't know the difference between a TV show and the real Jersey Shore.  So, to paraphrase a scene from one of my favorite movies, this is our opportunity. 
[00:24:30]  Look at this scene.  He's going to paraphrase.  So, to paraphrase a scene from one of my favorite movies, I can't quit you.  Oh, you had me at hello.  Oh, shut up.  So, to paraphrase a scene from one of my favorite movies, can I put my film in your refrigerator?  To paraphrase a scene from one of my favorite movies, yes, I am a woodsman. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, I hope he fucking breaks his leg in a rock quarry.  Oh, fucking idiot.  This is not even tongue-in-cheek.  No, he means every word.  Every single word.  Oh, no, he doesn't, by the way.  This is his statement, I guess.  To start the new era.  Yeah, his mission statement.  A scene from one of my favorite movies.  This is our opportunity to rise from the ashes and grab glory.  We are.  New York.  We are. 
[00:25:30]  New Jersey.  We are.  Long Island.  My head is tingling.  We are.  Connecticut.  We are.  Dish bags.  You.  Oh, my fucking God.  And they wonder why regular radio's dead.  This is horrendous.  We are you.  What are you talking about?  Hey, we can relate to them, man.  We are you.  Who enjoys that? 
[00:26:00]  That was so fucking douchey.  I'm humiliated for him.  Yes.  It's not over yet, man.  Oh, no.  We are.  Connecticut.  We are.  You.  Turn off your Spotify, shut down your Pandora, and you can't be serious, XM.  Uh-oh.  I got it.  Oh, we'll take that fucking challenge on.  You can't be serious.  It's spelled different, Todd. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Are you guys a little nervous?  I'm a little shaken.  I'm a little nervous.  Yeah, he's putting on his battle outfit.  Look out.  The battle-tested microphones.  Exactly.  I don't know about you, but I'm a little nervous.  Yes.  His battle thing is he completely covers up and hides his funny bone.  And he shoves a dildo in his asshole, and he crawls through glass to work.  I am.  We are Connecticut.  We are New York.  What do you name is Streep?  Michael is the King Boulevard.  We are the Bowery.  Shut up. 
[00:27:00]  But you guys got to be nervous, though.  A little nervous.  A little scared.  A little scared, right?  Did you hear about the whispers in his hallowed halls?  I heard about that.  We don't have those whispers here.  No, not at all.  Oh, no, because everyone fucking hates being here.  It's just screams of pain and torture.  There's no whispers in these hallways.  It's loud and clear.  You know how bad his fucking battle-tested microphones must smell?  After meatballs gets through with them.  Hey, someone spilled bleach on the microphone. 
[00:27:30]  No, no, I just did traffic.  Eric's whole job this morning is to just bring clips of his first show.  He understands that, right?  Oh, please.  Bring it in like a special report.  There's so much going on today, and this is story number one.  This is all I want to do.  Nothing more important than this.  Cancel all guests.  Wow.  This is bad.  I do have an update.  Yeah.  Disc 2 is on its way.  Oh, thank God.  Really?  I am so excited about this. 
[00:28:00]  Are you happy?  Yes.  I love being angry with these people.  Piers Morgan is going to be saying bye-bye to CNN.  There you go.  That's another story.  Bye-bye to Piers Morgan.  It just never worked out for the guy.  Ah, well.  What are you going to do?  All right, more of this.  Sirius XM.  New York's hometown radio station is back.  It's time to show them how it's done.  But what about all those years when you were doing it? 
[00:28:30]  Right.  What happened?  What happened?  Yeah, you were there.  You were there the whole time.  Literally been at the same show for 20 years.  It's a rebirth.  So he's decided after 20 years, it's really just time to start doing it.  We've gotten rid of the anchor, the albatross around my neck.  That's basically what he's trying to say.  That's what he's saying.  Yeah.  What is that?  Wow.  What a douche.  What a dillweed.  He is a dillweed.  There was nothing tongue-in-cheek about that. 
[00:29:00]  There's nothing tongue-in-cheek about his leather wristband, either.  No.  Oh, he's embarrassing.  We are you.  We are you.  Jeez.  Oh, he was probably so proud of himself when he fucking heard that.  Hey, I need you guys to yell out names of New York.  Connecticut!  Like the lamest yell.  That was so bad.  Three people yelling.  You think they all had to like sit and listen, like they turned it up really loud?  Do you think he wrote at first, too, do you think he wrote something like, and a father 
[00:29:30]  that's coming home from his job.  Oh, wait a minute.  Why don't we put two jobs?  That way we, you know, people know that we know they're working harder.  And we're here for them.  We're here for them.  Oh, God, I can't even fucking remember that now.  Mom's been up with the sick kid.  Oh, the mom with the sick kid.  Big deal.  Do your duties.  Just wants to laugh.  Do your job at home.  Get that toilet clean, that food on the table.  Right.  Fuck you and your laughs.  You're done rattling those pots and pans.  Get that ass in the bedroom. 
[00:30:00]  That's right.  Get that baby maker up in the air.  Right.  You guys want a healthy one, you fucking pig.  You pig.  How's the Facebook page going?  Oh, let's take, I mean, their listeners, the listeners are calming down a little bit.  Well, they're getting excited, I think, because it's the first show, but it's weird stuff.  Why is Mike Tyson biting your ear, Sam, on their Facebook page? 
[00:30:30]  It's hot, mate.  I don't know.  I don't think it makes sense.  You can't be serious, XM.  You can't be serious, XM.  You can't be serious, XM.  Hulk Hogan is kicking Beavis the cat.  Why is Hulk Hogan giving the big boot to Beavis?  Let it leave Beavis alone.  That's not nice.  When did Beavis grow to seven feet tall?  He is very tall.  Yes.  There's a picture of Jim and E-Rock wearing the same T-shirt.  It's just weird things to post on their Facebook page.  That is odd.  There's a Beavis on my house.  I've got a Beavis on my house.  And he's even bigger there. 
[00:31:00]  There's a picture of our former intern, Cream Pie Jones, eating a roach.  I don't know what they're talking about today.  Maybe they're talking about Cream Pie.  Here comes disc two.  And disc one isn't even over.  Smiling E-Rock bringing in disc two.  How bad is this, E-Rock?  Who's that?  Who is that?  I haven't even gotten to 630 yet.  Who's that?  E-Rock.  Who is that guy?  You know who this is on their Facebook page?  Who is that?  Oh, it's my friend Gittel.  My friend Gittel.  How did E-Rock make it on?  E-Rock's friend Gittel's page. 
[00:31:30]  The one he has his arm around is Anthony.  Oh.  I wouldn't have remembered.  How bad is this?  Really?  Oh, my God.  What?  You're shocked?  He just brought in another five clips.  Oh, my God.  Again, I just got to 630.  Wow.  This might be enough, though.  I don't know.  I'm going to skim through the rest of it.  There can't be enough.  There's got to be enough.  He also has a listener line, if you care for that.  Oh, no.  We enjoy a good listener line.  Do we ever.  We can leave congratulatory messages and well wishes. 
[00:32:00]  Be nice.  Be courteous.  What is the listener line?  We should help out our fellow broadcasters.  Yes.  It's 844-HEY-Todd.  H-A-Y.  Hey, Todd.  H-E-Y.  H-E-Y.  Hey, Todd.  Hey.  That's E-Rock's food.  Do you have a clip where this is mentioned?  Yes.  I was about to pull that, but it's not on the desk, but I'll pull it.  Oh, I was just going to say then.  Wow.  You got another good clip?  Well, no.  In the post, it says something that all the listeners can be on the lookout for is the new Todd Show trucks. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, yuck.  What?  They're sending, I guess they repainted every station vehicle they have, and they're sending them all through Long Island and New Jersey.  All right.  And they're telling you where it is.  No, you're sending them all through.  Long Island!  I'm looking.  New Jersey!  Connect!  I'm just seeing here.  Yeah.  Wait till you hear this promotion.  Oh, okay.  And this is why there are going to be places, well, like here, SiriusXM. 
[00:33:00]  And this is why they're going to kick SiriusXM's ass for bleak.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Like, this will be it.  Station vans.  We're in trouble.  This will be it.  Not only station vans.  Shit.  But if you take...  How did we think of this?  Ugh.  Wait till you hear the second element.  I know.  I know.  I'm not happy about it, Sam.  Second element.  Go ahead.  If you take a photo of the Todd Show truck, and you post it on Facebook or Twitter...  What was that?  Mars' phone wasn't on mute.  He's an engineer who hasn't figured it out.  Why are you watching videos?  Mars, we've got to be... 
[00:33:30]  We've got to be...  Oh, A-game.  Bring him to A-game, Mars.  We've got real competition with this Todd Show.  We're here talking into our battle-tested mics, and you're fucking, you know, making noise in the club.  Exactly.  Shape up or get the fuck out of here.  I mean, Martin, how are we going to compete?  If you see a Todd Show truck, and you post a picture on Facebook or Twitter with the hashtag TheToddShow,  you could win a Todd Show shirt and hat signed by the whole morning show.  Oh, my God. 
[00:34:00]  What else can he win from 1988?  It's terrible.  Signed by people you don't know yet?  You don't even know.  I mean, I'm assuming...  They barely want our autographs at this point.  Meatballs is included.  Yeah, no one's fucking asked for autographs anymore.  Right.  How are you...  Who's going to use Spotify when you could get an autograph from Meatballs if you see the truck?  You know what?  Meatballs.  Fuck.  Who's going to pay for radio?  Yeah, Fitz.  Dude, we got...  I'm telling you.  I love this.  We got the Todd Show song now.  No.  No.  You heard the douchey open. 
[00:34:30]  Is the open done?  It's an original.  No.  Yeah, the...  Is there any more open?  No.  Oh, I love the open.  But we can replay the open.  Oh, we should use it as our open every day and just put our names in it and just steal  it.  Because it's just quality stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Get some of our listeners back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, instead of Long Island, New Jersey, it just shouts for Opie, Oklahoma, we are, Anthony.  Here's the Todd Show song. 
[00:35:00]  It's an original?  I believe it is.  Good.  If all goes well on the air this morning, it'll be a miracle.  I say without hesitation that all of them are full of bull.  It could be worse than that old station, Jack FM, missing a brain stem, every one of 
[00:35:30]  them.  Oh, gosh.  It's the morning drive, 95.5, and the goal is to just somehow survive.  This might be bad.  It's hard to even follow.  I know.  It's another one of these fucking songs that is so overly produced.  You can't even fucking hear the words.  And it's actually a parody.  Of what?  Travis just told me a song from the movie Frozen.  Oh, I thought it sounded a little familiar.  Why would anyone listen to Satellite when you can hear funny, clean jokes like that? 
[00:36:00]  You're full of bull.  Full of bull.  Because the average listener loves a joke about Jack FM because everybody's obsessed with  radio and remembers that.  Who the hell even fucking remembers that?  No one does.  No one knows Jack FM.  No one.  Why wouldn't you go after some well-established station out there?  Well, they don't want to ruffle any feathers.  Wow.  Not a station that people barely remember.  Look, they already started a war with Sirius XM.  They sure did.  Who fucking even...  Like, this is the shit that kills radio. 
[00:36:30]  Like, this is why radio stinks.  Right.  They're reiterating why people leave radio.  Right.  They go...  So this started right after that intro?  Yeah.  So they go, oh, I can't wait to see what new shit the Todd show has in store for us.  And it's just another Todd-ridden, tired, shoehorned fucking parody.  Well, let's give it a chance, guys.  Should we?  The song hasn't kicked in yet.  No.  This might be bad, just like back then. 
[00:37:00]  It could be sad.  The Todd show, the Todd show, there's a good chance it could blow.  The Todd show, the Todd show, it could suck worse than that.  All the snow, here they are, in your house and car, it's a cold, more dark day, and this 
[00:37:30]  could be the end of PLG.  I get it.  It's self-deprecation.  What, Jimmy?  Wow.  You'll just like the song that much?  It's really fun.  I'm just bummed.  I didn't realize...  What?  I never quote myself, but the guy, Jim Norton quotes, is just quoting something I said  about a crib, and he's hashtagging the Todd show.  I'm just thinking, I'm reading the talk line, going, what is this?  This drivel.  You know, they go, win an autographed hat.  Oh, God. 
[00:38:00]  By the way, that movie Frozen is about Scott's face.  Win a new hat and a shirt.  I'd rather win our Bud Dwyer's tie.  Kenny, you dropped the goddamn hot sauce.  Stop laughing during the show and all those clips.  Like a freaking nightmare.  You just can't wake up from.  More irritating than Foursquare.  What was that line? 
[00:38:30]  I don't know.  Is it about Foursquare?  Foursquare and then what?  Exactly.  It's young, isn't it?  Yes.  Our show is Foursquare.  Why?  They're just throwing in every social media platform, I guess.  Oh, the kids are into it.  My Littsteel Drone.  It's morning drive 95.5.  And the goal is to just somehow survive. 
[00:39:00]  And I'll just add phone or iPad.  They're bad.  Time show.  The time show.  There's a good chance it could blow.  The time show.  The time show.  It could suck worse than all the snow.  Here they are.  In your house and car. 
[00:39:30]  It's a cold, dark day.  But God, we hope you listen anyway.  The Giddles army is attacking your Facebook.  They got all these pictures of E-Roc's friend Giddles.  What the fuck is a Giddles?  I don't even know when you get a Giddles picture.  I don't know what you do.  Amazing.  How could I be involved with this if I don't have a Giddles picture?  They found a whole bunch of pictures of Giddles. 
[00:40:00]  And they posted a picture of Giddles and E-Roc when he was young with his cool, like, circle sunglasses and blonde hair.  And little blonde hair.  And then it says the Giddles army is attacking your Facebook.  My favorite is the one of, it's Taxi and it's Beavis driving and Amy Schumer in the past.  And Amy's going like, ooh.  Like Beavis is diddling her like the taxi driver.  The tagline for this movie is, he's a cat, but she's frisky.  It'd probably do better than the real movie. 
[00:40:30]  Well, that was a great, is it over?  My chin picture.  Well, the song's over.  Good.  But now Todd says hi.  Oh, finally, the first break.  After all that bullshit, it's time for him to, now it's time for him to perform.  Battle-tested microphones cracking open and Todd.  You can have the greatest radio show open and you can have the greatest song about you.  But then these mics go live and you've got to have something.  That's true.  You just have to have something.  You've got to bring it.  So let's see what Todd brings on his first day as a solo morning show guy. 
[00:41:00]  Restoring terrestrial radio to glory.  Check it out.  The Todd Show in the morning.  The Todd Show in the morning.  95.5 PLJ.  Officially signing on the air, show number one.  The Todd Show, New York City's 95.5 PLJ 605.  Well, hello, everyone.  It's been a couple of weeks since we've had an opportunity to speak to you,  at least officially, in our time slot.  Yeah.  How you feeling, Monk?  It feels sort of unreal. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah?  Like, we've been talking about this moment for such a long time.  Yeah.  Now it's here.  And it's finally here.  Why is the music playing?  Because...  Well, you've got to have a music bed.  Why?  Because, you know, because what you're saying is bullshit.  Because it's new.  It's brand new.  With the reinvented radio.  Oh, wait a minute.  They did that forever anyway.  Oh.  Haven't they only...  They're only supposed to have been talking about this for like two weeks.  See, PLJ should have got rid of Todd as well.  Then it would have been new.  Right?  Then make it a young morning show.  Then you could say it's new.  Morning show.  Yes.  How embarrassing is it that the guy was just talking on the exact same mic two weeks prior? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And then Monk, who was also there, was like, yeah, it's kind of like a surreal...  No, it's not surreal.  No, it's actually exactly like it was, except the old codger isn't there anymore.  Yeah, they just finally got the old man out of the picture.  After they threw him down the stairs.  Yeah.  Don't get the fuck out.  The old bag.  Throw his wheelchair down the stairs.  Hey, Richard Widmark did it.  Yeah, babbling old hag.  Old hag. 
[00:42:30]  It's some good stuff right there.  That's some good stuff.  Exciting.  Very exciting.  It's going to reclaim radio, I guess.  Yeah, with the music bed.  Fucking nothing changed.  With the same old music bed.  The song that has the station name in it.  Right.  95.  Fuck.  Beavis Cumbia posted a photo of, I guess he's watching two lines have sex with each other.  It's on my big TV.  Yeah, it's Beavis porn.  Beavis porn.  Nice.  Yeah.  Why don't we do this?  We got food in front of us, and we have another five tracks. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, good.  Let me read the track.  Good.  Oh, please do.  The tracks for everybody.  On the way, you're going to hear...  No one's going anywhere.  On the way, you're going to hear Getting to Know You.  Oh, like that.  Getting to Know You, new staff.  Oh, okay.  Oh, good.  Getting to Know You, new staff.  Meeting Sheila.  Hala.  That's the name of the track.  Oh, no.  Is she like the sassy black girl, I wonder?  Meeting Fitz.  A Todd douchey moment on the way.  All right. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, good.  Meatball's first assignment.  Oh, no.  Already?  Wait, Meeting Fitz?  I think they misspelled that.  It's F-I-S-T.  New chairs have arrived.  And this is checked off.  Yeah.  And is being suggested that we should play immediately.  But it's Todd introduces a brand new concept.  Never done on radio. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  Oh, no.  Never done on radio.  You know what I'm noticing?  Not much diversity in the meet the personality section.  I just thought the same thing there.  Not much diversity on that morning show.  Gotta like it.  Mm-hmm.  Do you think Meatball speaks for any minorities?  No.  Oh.  Well.  No.  Maybe.  Maybe.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  So we're going to take a quick break and we're going to continue with part two as we  look at Todd's new, brand new morning show. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, this is exciting.  Without Scott Shannon.  Ah, kiss.  Fuck kiss.  Oh.  I got a love gun.  Jim Norton has blinders on, though.  He certainly does.  He'll always love kiss.  Kiss will not play at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony because they hate  each other.  Because Gene will not allow Peter, Chris, and Ace Freely to play. 
[00:45:00]  Gene and Paul.  Period.  It's Gene and Paul together.  And I don't know what the issue is.  It's Gene.  It's Gene more than Paul, though.  Paul would fucking...  I don't know about that.  I don't know about that.  You don't know about that.  No, I'll tell you why.  Because they've said some harsh things in their books.  Right.  Like, they were saying some really harsh things about Paul and Gene.  Which I'm not saying that I wouldn't have if I was them either.  But it might be Paul, too.  I don't think this is just Gene.  I think if you're going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, you've got to go original  lineup. 
[00:45:30]  And then if you want to bring some other guys on as an acknowledgement, like, well, these  guys have also been with us for, what, off and on 20 years at least, right?  Some of these guys?  Gene's a stupid asshole.  But Hall of Fame shit, you've got to go in as original as possible.  You have to.  Gene doesn't seem as easily offended, though.  Like, he's a guy that almost...  Because he's such a business guy, Gene could probably, I think, let things roll off his  back.  Like, and whatever.  Like his wig.  I would never say that about a guy who I love so much. 
[00:46:00]  You, my force.  But, you know, I think Gene would be more likely.  I think this is probably more for Paul Stanley.  That's my guess.  Wow.  Okay.  But you know more about Kiss than us, that's for sure.  Honestly, there's no reason to say that other than I think that Paul might have been really  offended by shit that...  Yeah.  But then again, Peter said that Gene had...  I think he said Gene had herpes.  He said Peter wrote that in his book, and then Ace did some hard shit about...  Peter also hinted that Paul...  No, Ace.  Is that Ace's book?  Ace hinted that...  No, Peter...  Wait, wait, wait.  Peter, Chris's book hinted about Paul Stanley maybe being a bit mysterious. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, I think that might have been Ace's, how he was doodling dicks all the time or drawing  cocks.  I think Ace said that.  I could be wrong.  Wait.  I read two Kiss books then?  Probably.  Look at you.  No, I think it was Peter, Chris.  Because I don't think I read Ace, really.  Mmm.  Whatever.  I could be wrong.  Yeah, of course harsh shit has been said, but you're going into the Rock and Roll Hall  of Fame.  Suck it up.  I agree.  They only play, what, three or four songs, right?  Lick it up.  What is that going down?  It's at the Barclays Center this year.  It's in April, yeah. 
[00:47:00]  You going?  If the original lineup will be there, I want to, because I want a photo with the four of  them more than I want fucking...  More than I want both of my legs to work into my early.  Look at you.  I don't think it'll ever happen.  Did we get the photo with the hole we're in?  Oh, we didn't have Peter, Chris, though.  No.  We had three out of the four, that's it.  Yeah, I've gotten three out of the four, but not all.  Right.  Who else is going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year?  That don't matter.  We got Todd Clips today.  Exactly.  There you go.  We've done two big stories around today. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Now back to the Todd show.  Back to the Todd show, which we're obsessing on.  If you're just tuning in and listening to the replay, that's one beauty of satellite radio.  If you miss something, you have another chance to hear it.  Exactly.  Scott and Todd used to be a show here in New York City that we had a lot of fun with over  the years.  A Jocktober staple.  And then they kicked Scott Shannon out the door.  He wasn't ready to retire.  No.  Although he sounded a bit, you know, older and stuff. 
[00:48:00]  Yes.  And I understand PLJ wanted to move on, but they probably should have just wiped out the  whole fucking show.  The whole thing.  But they think Todd can reinvent regular radio with the Todd show.  It's still Todd.  And today is day one of the Todd show, as he announced in the open.  Oh, the big fucking maudlin open.  The dramatic open.  Where it's day one of the Todd show.  Oh, yeah.  And you watch out.  His whole thing is that he's reclaiming terrestrial radio. 
[00:48:30]  A lot of changes and different attitudes and stuff.  And it's the same shit.  How about you just turn on your mic and just do it?  And if it works, great.  Yeah.  Don't tell everyone what you're going to do.  Just start doing it.  You thought it was maudlin?  Oh, God.  Maudlin.  I just want to play the intro again.  Dude, I want it to be the intro for this show.  Oh, it should be.  So now we're up to the...  Great.  We're up to where he has to, you know, now kind of introduce everybody.  The intro's over.  The song about the show is over.  Right. 
[00:49:00]  It's time to talk.  Time to intro the people.  Get to know the new show.  Let's get on with it.  Yeah.  And don't forget, if you see the...  I will help him out today.  If you see the Todd van...  All right.  You get a T-shirt and a hat autographed by a whole bunch of people you don't know.  People you don't know or give a shit about.  What a horrendous prize.  That's great.  Why wouldn't you give him cold, hard cash?  That's what people want.  Because that's old school radio, you know, when they actually had money. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  Wasn't Cooper with him before, though?  That Coop was there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I remember.  I liked her.  I couldn't even tell you.  Yeah, I wouldn't know.  Cooper was there.  What?  So was Monk.  Monk?  I don't remember Monk.  But I remember Coop.  Monk and Coop were both...  I mean, they literally kept the whole cast of Scott and Todd, except...  Scott and the fat traffic guy, Joe Nolan.  Oh, no.  Joe Nolan.  Oh, they got rid of Joe Nolan.  Poor Joe Nolan.  Oh, Joe.  Well, he's another old guy.  Right.  They got meatballs instead.  Well, they pushed up an intern and put him on staff. 
[00:50:00]  Nice.  All right.  Here we go.  Getting to know you.  New staff.  Oh, the disc doesn't work.  Oh, yes, it does.  Getting meatballs in here.  You know, we got real competition now.  We got to be on our A-game.  That's right.  God damn it.  Did he test his disc?  Get that fucking lumpy E-Rock in here so I can smash him.  Oh, this better work.  Okay.  Oh, it's very excited.  No.  He's got an A-5 error message. 
[00:50:30]  What?  Does that mean that he didn't...  Let me try it in this one.  The wrong kind of...  Try it in the other one.  Oh, shucks.  Oh, sugar.  We got to talk about language.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Oh, it's an A-5 error.  God damn it.  And his big dumb orange sweatshirt.  What the fuck?  Fucking fat tangerine.  You don't like his...  I loathe it.  Wait, what's that?  Big incompetent nectarine.  Sam's got some intel on this, on the CD.  I think I've done some troubleshooting and figured out what might be going on. 
[00:51:00]  It's burned on a DVD.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  God damn dummy.  We've had war declared on us, E-Rock.  We can't be burning audio things on DVD.  That's not a DVD player right there.  As we wait for Eric to bring down a new disc, I want to take this opportunity to tell you about my morning Nutribullet.  I bet that looks exactly the same shooting out your bungalows.  Oh, fuck yeah, it does.  That's what that mom took out of the sick kid's diaper in the head for the Todd show. 
[00:51:30]  Before she needed the hilarity, that's the Todd show.  Exactly.  Yeah, I'm drinking his hilarity.  I went with two boosts this morning because I knew it was a big day.  We have new competition in the radio world, so I went two boosts.  Smart, you need a boost.  You wanted the energy?  I wanted the energy, man.  We've got to be on our fucking A game.  Be on our toes.  Who's battling cancer now?  Jake the Snake Roberts.  Jake the Snake.  He's battling cancer.  Is he a new guy in wrestling?  Oh, boy.  And Hulk Hogan is going to be back with the WWE? 
[00:52:00]  Yes.  What is that about?  We've got Hulk Hogan coming back for WrestleMania this year.  Scott Shannon joining, too?  Jesus Christ, they're bringing the old guys back.  Well, Jake the Snake is going into the Hall of Fame, but coincidentally, he has cancer of the knee, I think.  Uh-oh.  Is that even possible?  Yeah, well, it's some weird, like, behind his muscle or something.  Oh, wow.  Ow.  Holy shit.  How do they do that?  I don't know.  But the fact that Jake the Snake Roberts has lived long enough to possibly have to die of cancer, of all things? 
[00:52:30]  That's crazy.  That's something to be proud of.  Yeah.  What is Eric doing?  He's probably, he was probably in the middle of burning that on another DVD.  Right.  Right.  DVD.  And it's like, oh, shit.  He's ruining our movie.  That's right.  He's been in this business for how long?  He's ruining our momentum.  You know what?  I know that he's a big fan, or was a big fan of Scott and Todd, right?  Yeah.  I think he is sabotaging. 
[00:53:00]  I think he's hoping.  He's a saboteur?  If I may use a word that we've heard here on this very program.  I think he's hoping meatballs doesn't work out.  Yeah.  Oh.  Or he just wants some to eat.  Or maybe he's distracted by the news that the Hulkster's coming back.  That's true, too.  Oh, God, yeah.  If I remember the list of heroes.  The top three.  Just go top three.  The top three?  Yeah.  Um, let's see.  Greg Opie Hughes.  How was he?  His father. 
[00:53:30]  And?  And the great Hulk Hogan.  My space hero.  That list was so bad.  That was so embarrassing.  Remember, what was the song that we were playing that he started to cry and he had to leave?  He started to well up.  Oh, he's running.  He's actually running.  Oh, my God.  Oh, good.  He made the corner.  He was going to smash in here like an asteroid.  All right, E-Rock.  All right.  You got it.  What happened?  Why'd you grab a DVD?  And E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock's running. 
[00:54:00]  He's taking this competition very seriously.  This is the new I dropped three pounds fucking E-Rock.  Oh, my God.  He's got a new fucking pep in his step.  You're a rail, baby.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  So we got Getting to Know You, the new staff, for this brand new show that has a lot of  the old guys on it, I guess, from the other show.  Plus, there's a bunch of new people we're going to introduce you to, and there's no time  like the present, because they've been waiting and stored away in coat closets for about a  month. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, the last one.  Yeah.  That's funny.  You think the last one's here already?  Oh, they're already here, Jimmy.  That's good stuff.  Come on.  That's good stuff.  I can't wait to be up all night with a sick kid.  Oh, and the laughs are coming.  Oh, yeah.  Because this is the remedy.  Well, let's do it.  Getting to know you.  Oh.  Getting to know you.  And he plays an ancient song.  I know.  It's in the 40s.  Because there's fucking old foggy. 
[00:55:00]  I like you.  Cornball.  Oh.  How much?  Just starring Meatballs in one of his dramatic productions, The Queen and I.  What an old man to play that.  That is.  What?  A little song for everything.  It's new and hip.  Oh, God.  Let's begin with a lady who came all the way from Poughkeepsie, New York.  She loves everything pop culture, family, and a good old-fashioned Rodgers and Hammerstein 
[00:55:30]  called Rodgering.  A good old-fashioned Rodgering.  A good old-fashioned Rodgering would have been.  By a man with melanin.  She enjoys a good old-fashioned Rodgering while being held down by someone who looks like  Nate Newton of the fucking early 90s at Cowboys.  That's what he should have done there, though.  Yes, of course.  And she's laughing because he said it all the way from Poughkeepsie, and that made her laugh.  That made her laugh.  Poughkeepsie's a funny place.  Good old-fashioned Rodgers and Hammerstein, New York.  She was born at New York Hospital to a midtown Manhattan stud that met his South Jersey 
[00:56:00]  good girl at the original TGI Fridays.  She's the typical middle child, extremely talkative, a tad bit naive, and always demanding  it's not fair.  Please welcome Anne-Marie Leamy to the talk show.  Welcome, Anne-Marie.  Thank you.  I'm so happy to be here.  That intro gave me such chills.  It's really happening.  It's really happening.  It's real.  It finally got here.  It's fair.  It's finally fair.  Now, we should also say... 
[00:56:30]  She's pretty, though.  It's beautiful, yeah.  I guess she was doing radio in Poughkeepsie or something?  Beautiful broads never work on radio.  No.  It's rare.  Sam's an exception.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Usually need one with a big sunglasses that hide behind a tree when they're taking a picture.  All right, man.  We might have worked for someone that had a very good radio voice, but when it was time 
[00:57:00]  for publicity photos, they were very creative.  They knew how to work it.  They actually had her peeking out from behind a tree with huge sunglasses on, so you couldn't  see any of it.  Was she fat?  Oh, a tad bit.  She was a big pig.  She had the sexiest voice, though.  The sexiest fucking voice.  And everyone would call me up going, hey, man.  I don't even want to give her name out.  No.  Hey, man.  When could we see... 
[00:57:30]  They were always like...  It was...  They were just...  She never had appearances.  No.  They hid her away.  So we all knew.  We just kind of had to kind of go, oh, no.  Soon.  Soon she's going to be out there.  Sexy voice.  Yeah.  Hey, Ope, how hot is she, man?  You must be lucky.  You're lucky to be working at the same station as her.  They couldn't fucking cover up more of her in that picture, I remember.  Big fucking Jackie O sunglasses hiding behind a tree, just peering out. 
[00:58:00]  In a little peekaboo.  Yeah.  If I remember correctly, I think you could only see one eye.  Yeah.  One eye with the sunglasses on.  Yeah.  So you didn't even really see the eye.  No.  Yeah.  Because they knew she was even ugly in sunglasses.  Oh, jeez.  Like Terry Clifford, except for the sexy voice.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll take my job, Sam.  Oh, come on.  I almost got it.  Oh, Sam.  Come on, Sam.  I'm going to Bed Bath & Beyond. 
[00:58:30]  Here is meeting Sheila.  Oh, we done with Annie?  I was enjoying her.  That was it.  Oh, Annie.  That was it.  All right.  Now, let's go to the beautiful state.  Let's.  Pennsylvania.  Yes.  Oh.  Prior to beginning her dream job here in New York City, she completed the page program  at The Late Show with David Letterman.  Oh, that's her.  She also rocked high-waisted khaki and told some hilarious puns while exploring the rivers  of the world.  She was a jungle cruise operator for Walt Disney World, ladies and gentlemen.  Yay!  Holla! 
[00:59:00]  Give it up for Sheila Watko.  Holla!  Yay!  What's up, Sheila?  Hi, Todd.  Thank you for having me.  Welcome, welcome to the show.  I'm so excited.  She sent me the most awesome video yesterday.  What was it?  Well, her big thing is for girls' long cup.  Yeah, exactly.  Recreation.  She was shitting into a skillet while spitting out song parodies.  Skillet.  What?  Todd is just reading the bio.  Of course he is.  That's it.  He's just reading the...  It's straight from the website.  Why would he just naturally converse about these people? 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, why would he just say, hey, stupid, what are you about?  Yeah, exactly.  Why does everything have to be so formal and forced?  Definitely forced.  They try to make us formal over the years.  Oh, they certainly do.  I'm sure you can find some tape of it.  We're kind of guilty, but you've got to push all those idiots aside and just do it.  Yeah.  Well, her big thing is holla.  Holla.  You know, so she had her whole family doing it.  The whole Watco family.  Oh, my God.  Maybe we can post that.  Yeah.  As we get going. 
[01:00:00]  The whole family does it.  Why?  They're extremely crazy.  Even the dog?  Well, the dog didn't see that.  The whole family's crazy.  He was involved in the whole thing.  It's fun.  No, it's nuts.  It's not going to hurt anyone, you know.  It's nutty.  You're not going to get that kind of fun on Pandora.  Oh, hell no.  Hell no.  And you're not even going to get that much fun outside the tri-state area.  It's local radio.  No, only New York, New Jersey, Connecticut.  Connection.  Those two clips, technically, we didn't have to play. 
[01:00:30]  The next three are highlighted.  Oh!  That means this is the good stuff.  All right.  Laughs are coming.  Meeting Fitz.  Wow.  And it says, a Todd douchey moment.  All right.  Be on the lookout for the first.  Well, it can't be the first.  Well, I know.  That's some douchey moments.  Now, I don't know if, can you go get our other fellow, please?  Because we have a new production guy who's, you know, he works in the back.  He puts together all the imaging for the radio station.  He's a Long Island guy.  Give it up for Long Island! 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, Long Island!  He was born to a New York City police officer and a lunch lady mom.  He's the youngest of six children.  He's spent most of his youth listening to New York City radio stations.  He's a radio guy.  He's writing and playing music, hanging out into South Levittown lanes.  Please give it up for Bill Fitzpatrick.  Yeah!  What up, Fitz?  What's going on, Todd?  Welcome to the show, brother.  Thanks for having me here.  Get out. 
[01:01:30]  What's the douchey moment there?  I bet I can guess.  It's just Todd talking.  What?  Bill Giles!  That was pretty fucking douchey.  What up, Fitz?  What's fairly difficult?  We're arguing over what was douchey.  Yeah.  I think the Long Island shout-out was pretty douchey.  Well, guys, it's time for Meatballs vs. Simon.  Oh, look out.  Show one.  Look out.  Watch it be really funny.  Watch it be something awful. 
[01:02:00]  Like you have to run to a nursery and put toe tags on all the kids  and then videotape the reactions.  Like some really outrageous, terrible, fucking cruel bit.  You know, you're going to fucking call in a bomb threat to a cancer ward.  Oh, fuck.  And then trip them and they all run out.  It's just some monstrous bit there.  Bits doing really bad.  Or whatever, Meatballs.  Meatballs.  Sorry.  I hope it's just old turd bits that man-cow have him do.  Ah, turd!  Meatball, meatball! 
[01:02:30]  You're driving the car toward the wall!  We got Paul in Jersey.  He's a Todd fan.  Paul.  Hey, hey, old Anthony.  Hey, hi.  I got a quick check-in call, Stan.  And the Todd van is there.  There's two people giving out stuff.  But nobody's going to like paying attention to them.  Oh, yeah?  You see the Todd van?  I'm parked right next to it.  And it's just sitting there?  Well, you should take a picture of it.  Yeah, get yourself a hat.  Get yourself a hat and a t-shirt.  That's right.  Signed by people you don't know. 
[01:03:00]  You win a hat and a station dildo that they insert with a croquet mallet.  So you see the Todd van and no one's there?  But isn't there a lot of excitement?  It's day one of the Todd show.  Yeah, it should be.  No.  No.  What do you mean, no?  There's two people trying to give out stuff.  Right.  Nobody even pays attention to them.  Oh, my God.  That's embarrassing. 
[01:03:30]  Well, what are you going to do?  Well, there is obviously excitement on their Facebook page because where they're announcing  that the Todd...  Now, you're not even looking for the Todd show truck anymore.  There's a...  The guy from...  They're just telling you where it is now because...  The quick check address is posted.  Are you trying to say that the Todd van stunt is a bit of a bust?  Yeah.  So now they're just giving the address out?  Well, one of the comments on the address to where you can find the Todd show truck is a  photo of Tom Skerritt.  Nice.  Ah, there you go.  There he is.  All right.  Let's find out what Meatballs' first assignment is. 
[01:04:00]  Show one for the Todd show.  And we got a great day for you, Meatballs.  Your first assignment is just waiting for you to attack it.  Alec Baldwin has said he's done.  He's going to move out of New York.  So we're going to send Meatballs to his house.  You have to convince Alec Baldwin to stay.  Hey, this is a brand new show.  How can I possibly do a brand new radio show if there's no Alec Baldwin in New York City?  Can you imagine if he bolted all that content that goes with him to Los Angeles? 
[01:04:30]  That's not fair to you.  Yeah.  It's going to be impossible.  We need him here.  Yes.  What do you think we'll give him to stay?  Should we get him some donuts, cronuts, what?  Yeah, well, you've got to do good stuff.  Yeah, we'll get him everything you can get in Los Angeles.  New York cheesecake.  Right.  You know, maybe get a cab driver and drag him with you.  Look.  You can't get these in Los Angeles.  The bagels are terrible in Los Angeles.  Oh, awful.  Inedible.  Pizza.  Pizza.  Get him all that.  Sucks.  Wow.  But be nice to him.  He doesn't like when you're not nice.  With his show.  What?  There's a problem with his show.  Not enough voices at one time. 
[01:05:00]  Holy shit.  I can't.  I'm stunned.  Remember, guys, let's keep the energy up.  Whenever we're on the air, everybody just say anything.  Just say anything.  Make a noise.  We cannot have a half a second of real conversation or dead space.  That was really bad.  Yeah.  Ah!  Oh, ah!  Give him a donut or a cronut.  Maybe they're all just nervous first day.  Give him a fuck.  Fuck him.  No one gave us a fucking break.  And it's not the first day.  It's just Scott's not there. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, Scott's not there.  Right.  Same studio.  All that.  Sucks there.  But be nice to him.  He doesn't like when you're not nice.  Oh, I'll be very nice.  Be very nice.  I will.  My goal is to get you punched in the head today.  I'll take one for the team.  If Alec could punch you square in the head, that to me is Christmas morning.  I mean, it's already exciting.  That's a little edgy.  There you go.  A little bit.  Wow.  Is it?  A little bit.  Yeah.  The hashtag, the Todd show.  Doing well? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, the hashtag's doing well.  It's just...  Oh, they got the big hashtag for their first day, so congratulations.  I would imagine a lot of people are tweeting using that hashtag.  Well, they are, but most of them are not talking about the Todd truck.  Uh-oh.  They're saying things like, uh, get your official The Todd Show merch at Ted's Douchey Radio Show  and Florian.  I don't think that's real.  No?  No.  Well, you know that they're probably looking at their hashtag.  Whenever you have a hashtag, it means you want to track who's...  That's true. 
[01:06:30]  ...the buzz on the show.  You think they're just going to be sad when they see all the opiate Anthony people using  their hashtag today?  Like, why do these guys bother us all the time?  Can't they just leave us alone?  I think we get so excited, they're going to go, someone's going to run in and go, you're  not going to believe it, there's a thousand tweets using the hashtag The Todd Show, and  they all sit around the computer, and one after another, it's from us, our guys.  What happens if they send meatballs down here to do a prank on us?  I don't know how we would handle that, Sam, to be honest with you. 
[01:07:00]  It could be a little scary.  Todd introduces a brand new concept.  You ready for this?  Oh, is this the never before heard on radio?  Yes.  Oh.  The Todd Show, day one.  Todd introduces a brand new concept, never done on radio.  Wow.  Holy shit.  He had 20 years to do this.  Yeah.  What happened?  Why would you sit on a bid for 20 years?  Who does that? 
[01:07:30]  Time for the first Todd Show phone scam.  We got an email from Kim who told us that her sister...  No, no, no, no.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  We were duped.  Todd Show phone scam.  We were duped.  This asshole is trying to reinvent himself, and he's...  He's doing the same shit.  And he insists that the phone scam has to go with the brand new show, right?  Isn't this all the first hour of the show?  Yes.  So, in the first hour of his new relaunched Younger Hipper show...  Yes.  That's in quotes, by the way.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  His phone scam?  The phone scam.  It's a staple.  ...was about to throw a huge birthday party for her eight-year-old son.  Kim said that Sarah had been super stressed putting the whole thing together, so we called,  and, well, we wanted to make her feel even worse.  This is called Kippy's Cupcakes.  Kippy's Cupcakes.  Why is he still doing the phone scam?  Can I guess?  Because he sucks his money.  Oh.  That's a good one.  Why would he still do the phone scam if you're reinventing yourself? 
[01:08:30]  Just say, ah, fuck it.  Yeah, they're terrible.  Because that's a staple of the Scott and Todd Show, and if you want everyone to forget about  Scott immediately...  Uh-huh.  ...you would get rid of all those bits.  Oh, no.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  Here we go.  I've seen that one.  What is it?  It's, uh...  I'll show you.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, yeah.  It's very vile.  I don't even know...  It's very vile.  Why would you give your cat that shirt? 
[01:09:00]  I never gave my cat that shirt.  It's on the hashtag Todd Show.  But they're checking their hashtag now, man.  That's not cool.  ...  ...  That's not cool at all, guys.  Oh, I didn't even catch that.  You didn't notice his shirt?  I didn't catch that.  That's from the Caterpillar, um...  Oh.  ...Caterpillar tractor and, uh...  ...like, heavy machinery company.  Yes, I didn't...  So he's wearing a shirt that has a cat on it. 
[01:09:30]  And then the cat's wearing another shirt that says something else.  Oh, boy.  That's fucking hilarious.  Jesus, Jimmy.  It's the oatmeal.  I didn't even catch that, dude.

[01:27:00]  girl talk  well  oh boy  todd's show song  as performed by todd  meatballs is now at alex baldwin's house  no he's not  you don't think so  i want to hear the meatballs thing  a soon to be staple of the todd show  oh  these all sound great  yeah  yeah  i want to hear the stunt  and  it looks like uh  cigars and scotch  may be abandoning his long time on a fan  uh-huh  may be abandoning us  because he's actually created a new hashtag 
[01:27:30]  oh  oh  the tarred show  oh god  and he said he found the van  which is a short school bus  that's a short school bus  yes  that's not the van  but he included the todd show hashtag  too  he certainly did  let's squeeze another story out  if we're going to do more todd stuff  yes  olympics are over  all right  that's it  all right  closing ceremony  and we won a few medals  very sad  second overall  there you go  yeah  that's it  yeah  that's all you got 
[01:28:00]  are we having them on  rolling i forgot  we said no right  okay  saw uh  the wolf of wall street finally  oh  oh yeah  from the comfort of my uh  my home  isn't that great  it is great  that leonardo dicaprio 
[01:28:30]  plays leonardo dicaprio  in every fucking movie  oh you think that's uh  just  there's no  there's no stretch with his acting  hmm  he's very good  in that role  but  there's nothing  yeah  amazing happening with him  and his acting  right  he seems to be getting a lot of movies  right  a lot of big productions  i like the movie a lot  i uh  i thought it was way too fucking long though  i did  travis doesn't think so  i didn't mind  because i watched it in two parts 
[01:29:00]  so it was okay for me  well  here's the problem  and then if you have a young kid in the house  you gotta pause it a lot  oh man  so it makes it a lot longer  how long was the movie  i swear  three hours  oh it took us four hours to watch  oh wow  that's how many interruptions we had on uh  that's crazy  what day was it  friday  saturday  uh whatever  on the dvd they're putting out  they're adding an extra hour  oh god  why  it'll be four hours  i didn't think it was too long either  i watched it in theater  and it was not  i enjoyed it  jonah hill is a great actor by the way 
[01:29:30]  yeah he was great  jonah hill is phenomenal  he showed some range  with that character  with those big dumb teeth  brought it all together right  i liked it  yeah  yeah  it was too long  i had a  i had a parenting moment though  during the movie  like  we set up my son in the other room  so he watches his tv  my young son in the other room  but he has to come in  and ask a million fucking questions  and then he's wondering  why the  why are  we watching a movie without him  he can't understand  that  the world might 
[01:30:00]  not revolve around him  24 hours a day  yeah  and then he comes running in  so  my wife's like  because you know  there's a lot of nudity in the movie  obviously  so i pause it  and  and then i'm panicking  because of what's on the screen  and then i decide  you know what  ah  it looks like  mr potato head  fuck it  it was the scene  where leonardo dicaprio  was blowing coke up  that girl's asshole  yeah  but when i freeze framed it  all it was 
[01:30:30]  was the ass  right  so to me i'm like  ah  it looks like a mr potato head  but then i panicked  and it went forward a little more  and now you can see her head  and the whole body  and that's just sitting  on the screen  while he's asking his little  almost four questions  oh man  what are you gonna do man  i don't know  what are you gonna do  i wouldn't know what  i would just sit there  watch the movie  let him come in  look at the movie  i don't know  yeah  i'd be terrible  but at first though  i thought i was safe  because i'm serious 
[01:31:00]  it looked like just  mr potato head  yeah  yeah that ass was just  up way high in the air  that hey  looked like that goofy  mr potato head  before you put the  the eyes and the ears  and the nose on it  it's hard to explain  a lot in that  like why is her hiney  in the air  yeah yeah yeah  why is it smelling out of it  why is that noise  it's a lot to explain  it's nice to see nudity  in a movie again  yes  certainly is  they really have gotten rid  of uh nudity  yeah  unless it's uh  you know  fucking dick shots  are okay  but but  i love that  you see breasts  full frontal 
[01:31:30]  that's that's kind of  the new thing  but they got rid of  the the female body  being nude in movies  maybe that'll  make a comeback  bunch of pussies  i liked it though  yeah  it wasn't  it was pretty good  i like that  leonardo dicaprio  though in movies  don't you think  he doesn't have  a lot of range though  hey  he doesn't have  a lot of range  but he's good at that  and he's always that guy  but he's good at that  and that guy  he's good at that guy  so  all right  we did another topic  there you go

[01:34:30]  i am a father  oh man  it was the walt whitman mall  i just happened to be there yesterday  i did a little long island trip yesterday  went to fh riley's for lunch  oh shit  almost saw my brother for a second  he was in the middle of firing people  was he  oh man  he takes his restaurant very seriously  clean house  it's tough to fucking run a restaurant  period  yeah  he's still kicking ass  but fuck he works hard  he ran through the  the dining room area  and i said hey  and he went hey  and that was it  that was it  came all the way from manhattan  to huntington 
[01:35:00]  i saw my brother for five seconds  um  and then uh  it was my mom's birthday yesterday  oh yeah  that was alright  yeah you celebrated  no stories there really  got flowers and some fucking truffles  said here  there you go  said here  we'll make believe this is fun  give it an hour  oof  old age homes  stink  horrendous  there was a guy doing a gig there too  singing  oh no 
[01:35:30]  and he looked like he was ready for the old age home himself  really  he was making some of that old age home money  he's singing the sinatra  and all this  all these songs when these people were like fucking young and full of calm  yes  and they're just  oh now they're just sitting there  one lady was  oh she's leaning back with her mouth open  wide open  i don't know  is there a better way  i guess no  you got to be nice to your family  so they don't throw you one of those joints  yeah 
[01:36:00]  that's probably  a wise decision  gonna happen to all of us  if you're lucky  right  oh man  but anyway  oh so i went to the walt women mall  yeah  and i saw the news  vans out there  some dude  fucking died of carbon monoxide poisoning  yeah they had a water heater  and the little flu  the little flu pipe  that the exhaust goes out of  right  had a malfunction  so all the gas from the water heater 
[01:36:30]  the exhaust was just filling up the basement  and the guy  he's the manager  and they think he has an office downstairs or whatever  but there's definitely a bathroom down there  and they pretty much found him dead in the bathroom  was he on the toilet  or was he taking a piss and just fall asleep  man  i don't know but  then other people went down  because they knew he was down there for too long  uh-huh  they rushed him to huntington hospital  but i would assume he was dead  yeah  they were doing the story on cnn  this is a huge story today  and uh 
[01:37:00]  then the people that were going downstairs  to check on the manager  they were passing out  yep  so there's people all  in three area hospitals  that had carbon monoxide poisoning  that fast they passed out  it doesn't take long  it doesn't take long huh  you just fucking pass out  we got detectors  you're not getting air  we got detectors in our house  yeah  and you don't even know  if it's hitting you  because it's odorless  yeah  so you don't even know  all of a sudden you just feel a little woozy  then boom you're dead  it really happens fast  very  if there's a  if there's a lot in the room  like if it's really fucking 
[01:37:30]  full of it  yeah  it'll happen real fast  you just fucking  whoa  and also you get like this whole  kind of a weird euphoria thing  so you don't even realize  that there's a problem  right  you'll just start like  oh  blow  fall right over  and I guess the detectors  aren't even a law  they're not  I don't know  that's what  I think that's what they were saying  you would think they should be right  yeah  and then they realized  there was a major fucking issue  so it was legal seafood  at the mall  the Walt Whitman mall 
[01:38:00]  and all of a sudden  they just said  get the fuck out  so they said  it's kind of creepy  because everyone just left  their half eating  eating dinners  on all the tables  and got out of there  freebie  I hope so  nice  got a little freebie action  out of that  not a bad price to pay  a throbbing fucking  three day headache  right  for a free legal seafood dinner  I like a good legal seafood  oh yeah  we used to like legal seafood  where were we  Boston I guess  Boston  we had a lot of legal seafood  because  somebody loved going there 
[01:38:30]  mmm  yummy  the old mother-in-law  not my mother-in-law  yeah  yeah  married at the time  no  Judy  Judy loved the legal seafood  I love legal seafood  it's wonderful  I'll have a lobster  and a grandma yay  oh thank you Anthony  yeah  great  how long is this gonna take  how many times  did we go to legal seafood 
[01:39:00]  oh so many  I kinda liked it at the time  when I left Boston  I think that was the last time  I went to legal seafood  why couldn't that fucking  water heater have malfunctioned  so  it was kinda creepy though  to see all the news trucks yesterday  mmm  the Walt Whitman Mall  yeah creepy  ready for the Todd show  we're missing some laughs here  please  we're missing some big laughs  please  oh  let's see  so the Todd show 
[01:39:30]  is discussing the new  show photo  that we looked at  it kinda has a friends vibe to it  yes  they're making Todd look younger  by the way  the only media outlet  the Today Show  has a  topic that's trending  across the United States  and the Todd show  nice  so that lets you know  the power of the Todd show  congratulations to the Todd show  hey  as long as they're talking about us  let them say whatever they want  right gang  yeah well  no  what if

[01:41:00]  as we move forward  but check out the pictures  because I think it's probably  one of the coolest radio station shots  I've ever seen  is it?  I mean  really  we didn't deserve it  that's self deprecation  self deprecation man  people love it  it's endearing  it's endearing  deserve it  it was so good  is there a second place?  I don't think  I don't think so  it's first and then  everyone else  there's one of that  station in Seattle  did kind of a cool thing 
[01:41:30]  they were like  hanging off the roof  or doing something  of the space needle  yeah  of the space needle  it looks like a Vogue shoot  we should get out to  Anna Wintour  to put it in Vogue  yeah  and it's like  wait that's us  yeah  it's really strange  I watched it like 15 times  my family was bawling  their eyes out  they were like  oh my gosh  really  yeah it was so intense  that's funny  my mom even said  you look good  in that picture  she said I look good  yeah you don't look  anywhere near that good  in real life  don't tell anyone that  people should know that  no  a lot of these folks  by the way  if you're just tuning in  hey how you doing 
[01:42:00]  we missed you  it's the Todd Show  back on PLJ  look  look there's a good photo  that's a great photo  right there  it's a giant long neck  exactly  smiling without squinting  what look  it's just like their photo  right  yeah  eyebrow  don't forget about your baby arm  Reagan makeup on  and a baby arm  look at his baby arm  all I can see is his baby arm  how about that 
[01:42:30]  that raised eyebrow  that comes from a different photo  I know  that guy should be shot  it's terrible  he was terrible  even the logo is fucked up  because he couldn't match the logo  yeah he couldn't match it  oh god  that's crooked  we might have to put that  on our podcast  us discussing that photo  how many errors  did we end up finding  over 20  it was over 20  it started with my really long neck  because he put my face  from another shot on my neck  and didn't match it up  and then we discovered  his baby arm  my baby arm  he cut the picture in half 
[01:43:00]  isn't your elbow in the wrong place  or is my elbow in the wrong place  look how far over his aunt's elbow is  his elbow is literally  but then I got a bicep  between my elbow and my wrist  what's that  yeah your arm is lumpy  it's not a tumor  what a horrible picture  yeah it's really bad  their photo  Scott and Todd  the Todd photo  is actually a good picture  oh that's a good picture  it's the coolest picture  any radio show's ever had  that Annie is a delight  yeah 
[01:43:30]  I will have no  I will have no bad mouthing  of that delicious  lovely Annie  fucking sexy right there  let's uh  let's uh  go to the next track here  Todd's first show  oh good  as the Todd show  continues to trend  on Twitter  throughout the nation  uh  Todd engages in some  girl talk  Annie was in Poughkeepsie  right  so she had to come  all the way down  and where are you now  are you like in Westchester  are you halfway  right now I'm actually  in Poughkeepsie  I'm trying to transition  probably in the next  couple weeks  I should be in the city 
[01:44:00]  but you know  I own a home  back home  so I'm trying to  figure the whole  transition out  and hope this thing  works  yeah I hope it works  and you know  the commute's not bad  couple weeks  you could be back  in Poughkeepsie  and I might be there  with you  and then Sheila  and Meatballs  were from the  Pennsylvania area  but Sheila was already  here because she was  working at the  Letterman show  exactly  and she has kind of  an interesting story  you do not live alone  I do not live alone  no  you have two roommates  I do have two roommates  where did you meet them  on the lovely website  that is Craigslist  now isn't that  a stripper and a killer  something like that 
[01:44:30]  but it's okay right  I mean so far  no one's tried to kill you  or because Craigslist  I worry about you  I know  no one's tried to kill me  no one's tried to sell me  into any sort of  sex slavery  so I can't really  hope for anything else  you know  that's all I ask  that's good  but do you have plans  perhaps down the road  a little bit  to get away  from the Craigslist  stalkers  I do  and maybe in a year  or so  hopefully I can bang  out some student loans  get a nice studio  I do prefer to live  by myself  maybe get some cats  because I'm a cat lady  at heart  okay that didn't 
[01:45:00]  sound cool  usually you don't  plan on getting cats  it happens  or you just take  one in  and next thing you know  you turn around  and there are 90  living all over your house  you know like this  what is that smell  I started with one cat  that's the first break  that didn't annoy me  yeah because it's just  talking  no music  he's just talking to them  yeah  just do that  there's nothing wrong  hopefully you'll find your way  yeah  somebody found a picture  of the Todd truck  oh no that's two guys  that's two really good  looking guys 
[01:45:30]  kissing each other  very good shapes  yeah I'll say they are  Bonnie's on these two  yeah we didn't need to play that one  that was like  yeah that was like  actually a regular old break  well whatever  he wasn't going  and then my roommate  he did it for a half a second  at the end  yeah he slipped into it  yeah he's like  what are you gonna be  a roommate or something  yeah  I gotta get out of that  uh the Todd show song  that's performed by Todd  you're about to witness  something  the human ears  never heard 
[01:46:00]  the human ears  the human ears  human ears  he is the king  of the shoe horn  the king  it's supposed to be  human ears  yeah alright  and he goes  human ears  human ears  I can't take a shoe horning  you're about to witness  something  the human ears  never heard  it's the poking  prodding  manipulation  of spoken word  it's a daily celebration  of the good  and bad in life  and some satire 
[01:46:30]  so sharp  it feels like  it came from a knife  wake up with the Todd show  wake up with the Todd show  wake up with the Todd show  it's harder than a cop  the Todd show  I don't know  I didn't know  half the words  because they're not words  they're fucking  twisted around words  versions of the words  I don't know  I don't know  what happened  it's terrible  it's really bad  I don't know  that's bad stuff  shoe mini ears 
[01:47:00]  just like Jack Tober  this is falling apart  again  oh it's just the word  it starts out so much fun  right  you just get angry  yes  ruins my day  we spent two hours  attacking him  and I'm sure Eric's  going to run down  with another desk  this might be it though  Meatballs  he's at Alex Baldwin's house  now  if you're listening  Alec whatever  is he  yeah  Alec Baldwin's house  remember you set that bit up earlier  oh boy 
[01:47:30]  Meatball is their  stunt kid  stunt guy  look out  now he's definitely  really there right  yes  why would he like  meatballs  what's the story  with Alec Baldwin  by the way  we could get a little more  material out  oh Alec Baldwin  he wrote a whole like  little essay  anti-media  wrote a little essay  about his situation  with the paparazzi  and the media  but doesn't he make it worse  because he's an asshole though  well yeah  but he even kind of  dresses that  in this little essay  thing that he did  it's really good  it's well done  he's right 
[01:48:00]  he says he loathes  and despises the media  and he's right  he used to walk around  our neighborhood Jimmy  because  well I think I know why  maybe he wants to keep that private  nothing too crazy  and I  he would walk in the middle  of Columbus Avenue  so he wouldn't be bothered  right  yeah  with the traffic  he figured he was safer  in  in the middle of traffic  not in the middle  on the sidewalk  on the side  you know  on the side  as cars are zooming by  instead of the sidewalk  yeah  between the sidewalk  and parked cars  he would walk with the traffic 
[01:48:30]  well he's saying  he's leaving New York  he wants to go to LA  where you can just stay  in a gated house  get in your car  drive  not have to interact  with people  he said in the old days  you could walk around New York  and people were kind of cool  they'd be like  hey big fan  or something  and then leave you alone  right  because now it's just  nothing but a barrage  of pictures  people trying to  catch you in an embarrassing  moment so they could  put it up on  Twitter and Facebook  and you know  they're just waiting  for you to make a mistake  right  he had a lot of really  legit points  in that thing  it was great 
[01:49:00]  it was a little long winded  but I still thought  it was really good  that he wrote  yeah I hung in there  for the whole thing  me too  it was pretty well done  what else did he say  that was pretty  the gist of it  that was the gist of it  and how just  crazy and hateful  and vicious  everyone's gotten  and the news  is just based on  ratings  and titillating  and barely news  he wanted to do a show  for MSNBC  that was kind of  an eclectic  talk show  like his podcast  and you know 
[01:49:30]  just have on  strange weird guests  he mentioned one  like oh Debra Winger  who's heard from  Debra Winger in years  what do you want  to have her  and they were like  really no  we  like he just wanted  to do this  we didn't want  a controversial show  or one that had  a lot of conflict  in it  you just want to  have a fun goofy  fucking talk show  and he didn't want  it to be on MSNBC  he wanted it to be  on NBC  but he figured  after a year  on MSNBC  maybe they  maybe they'll move it over  they said let's tool it here 
[01:50:00]  yeah yeah  right  and he got nothing  but the MSNBC  assholes over there  were fucking with him  he bashed Rachel Maddow  he said she's a phony  he said Joe Scarborough  is not funny  and he said something  about the Mika  which is not kind  I don't remember  what it was  oh we hate Mika  here on our show  yeah  so it was really  scathing  yep  scathing as far  as mainstream media goes  yep  and he bashed Anderson Cooper  and a couple of the other  he said like the gay mafia  yeah  who were wanting him vilified  and he's like 
[01:50:30]  these are people  who think I'm a homophobe  and he's  the guy just  and he bashed Harvey Levin  of course  and I don't think  he's a homophobe  at all  no I don't think he is at all  what did he say again  I forgot even  apparently he said  it didn't matter that much  he said to one guy  you little queen  or whatever  he's bashing him  and they  some TMZ guy  said that Alex  said you cock sucking  motherfucking like faggot  but Alex said  it's muffled  and he didn't say faggot  he said  he did call him a cocksucker  yeah  but even he did say faggot  he's not  it's not in the tone  of hey you're gay  I mean this 
[01:51:00]  specifically because of that  and you're going to reach  for the worst word possible  if you're being bothered  yes  right  yeah  why do we make believe  that doesn't happen  it gives people a platform  I guess  it's ridiculous  back to the Todd show  so  there's your set up  so Alec Baldwin  wants to leave  so the Todd show  you know  they got this stunt boy  Meatballs  they sent Meatballs  down to Alec Baldwin's  residence  to try to talk him  into staying  staying in New York  in New York 
[01:51:30]  by maybe offering up  some New York  delicacies  oh that sounds great  gotta throw some bagels  in there  some pizza maybe  cronut  maybe a cronut  so let's see how  Meatballs  handles his first assignment  cluelessly wandering  the streets of New York City  what an idiot  Meatballs  he got his first assignment  this morning  which to go to  Alec Baldwin's house  and try to convince him  not to leave New York  because as Cooper told us  Alec said he's done 
[01:52:00]  he's fed up  he can't take it anymore  so Meatballs  are you there?  yeah I'm right here Todd  right out front of  the Devonshire house  do you have a game plan  if he is to come out  because because  there's other media there  you're gonna have to  work your way through  you understand  we want him to hear  your voice  convincing him to stay  is there a game plan?  well yeah  I have a couple things  first there's this  doorman  who I'm trying to  get up close to  smart  good move  I left the money  that you gave me  somewhere on my desk 
[01:52:30]  so I had little funds  to work with  to bribe him  but I got a couple muffins  I ate one on the way down  Meatballs  you gotta remember  to bring that stuff  because it's very important  that's bribe money  holy fuck man  wacky stunt guy  bring your bribe money  this is the show  that's gonna bring  everyone back  to regular radio  huh?  yeah  this wacky stunt guy  is gonna do it  I don't know  what's that?  this is just fun  remember to bring that stuff  because it's very important 
[01:53:00]  that's bribe money  you need to have that  in New York  I know  but I only had  three dollars  we gave you money though  I forgot it Todd  I know  alright  so you're gonna need  to come up with  some sort of clever  chanter  so he's a bumbling fool  yes  oh wow  he's a bungler  that's a real stretch  for the stunty guy  aren't they always  the dumb bumbling guy  to be shit on  what do you mean  he ate one of the donuts  on the way down there  now turd  right  it's just stupid  this is the cutting edge 
[01:53:30]  new fucking stuff  that's going on over there  why don't you just talk  about what's going on  down there  there's a photo  of uh  on the Todd show twitter  yeah  of the gift basket  that's the gift basket  that silly meatballs  brought down to Alec Baldwin  it's on the back  of a bicycle  and a cardboard box  or something  why would you tweet that  just to show  how much fun we're having  oh  so you're gonna need  to come up with  some sort of clever  chant or anything  otherwise you're just  gonna be one of the  paparazzi just screaming  his name  right  so do you have any  like chants ready to go 
[01:54:00]  oh yeah  oh yeah  we have an excited  group of people here  what we're just tweeting for  so what's your chant  what's my chant  yeah  uh it would be uh  Alec please don't go  please we want you  as a guest on the Todd show  alright well let's hear it  let's hear it  that's not bad  maybe you can get him  to do that  no that's really bad  let's hear the chant  let's go for it  no that's like really bad  wow this is really  fucking  no that's really bad  embarrassing  this is a terrible bit

[01:55:00]  turning news into a Todd show bit  I did want to say too  yeah  speaking of their Twitter  a minute ago  they tweeted  the Todd show  hashtag  the Todd show  is a trending topic  in the US  thanks everybody  and then immediately  deleted it  oh  oh  oh  because they realized why  they must have realized  where they were sending  their fans to  so there was a  oh no  what's they doing  that's like

[02:06:00]  you're  you're putting stuff in front of my door  that my kids can trip over  is it  it's not Alec Baldwin  is it  they have not said anything  otherwise  it's not Alec Baldwin  Alec Baldwin's not gonna interact  with the media now  and he's  and he's definitely not gonna interact  with meatballs  meatballs  with the likes of a meatballs  well we can  we can all agree  that the bit is not  oh we can all agree  alright  yeah  it's not going well 
[02:06:30]  no  it's very bad  alright  hold on  let me see something here  I'm exhausted  we gotta go check for more material  we're being tracked back in  Jesus  I think something was going on  oh fuck 
[02:07:00]  I just wanna go to the bathroom  I think  I think he knew something  is meatballs there yet  hey what's up  what's going on  what's  what's happening over there  well  sorry about that  I don't know what happened  with the phone  but I have a great  set up here  I have my bike  right out front of the door  so you're gonna hit my bike  if you walk out the door  yeah  sure  and it's got the box on it  and it's got  I got a really expensive  key  with the chocolate 
[02:07:30]  quescent  and  quescent  what's a  quescent  quescent  and  that's french right  meatballs  that's french yeah  you don't have a great accent  for that  a quescent  that was written for him  what the fuck  that's what Todd thinks is funny  he wrote that line for me  say quescent  I can work off that  that sounds like  something he put in one of his  phony phone calls 
[02:08:00]  oh he wrote that for the stupid kid  somebody dropped the quescent  we gotta drain the pool  see now he can rip on  the fact that he said  quescent  so meatballs  give us a scene  describe what's going on  outside of alcohol  right now  in downtown Manhattan  alright you got it  and I also have  some breaking news here  first there's a bunch of  news crews out  trying to get to  but there was this lady  who was walking out  of the building  with a bunch of dogs  and I went and talked to her  and they came over 
[02:08:30]  and tried to bike  and I said  no that's for Alec Baldwin  and her name was  Nancy Friedman  she's a celebrity  dog walker  she does walk  Alec Baldwin's dog  and she said  she can't believe  Alec would say that  because he's a real nice guy  I gotta find out  what's going on  over here  because Sheila and Annie  cannot even breathe  what's wrong  she had to quescent  if it's a breaking news  he met the dog walker  it's very breaking  dire scenario 
[02:09:00]  when we were in that  secret location  me and Sheila  used to go get a quescent  every morning  and we would share it with him  so how he doesn't know  how to say it  he can't say it  he'd wash it down  with his Dunkin Donuts  no it's because  he can't retain things  he's a brain like  an Etch-A-Sketch  if you don't say it  in a minute  it's gone  take that  what do you call it  a quescent  quescent  jam it down your throat  beatballs  come on  this is your first assignment  well I think  I'm doing a good job 
[02:09:30]  are you saying  I'm not doing a good job  that's exactly  what I'm saying  nothing has happened  you've set up things  in hopes that he trips  over them  that's what I'm going  to make him want to say  you're setting up  a lawsuit for Todd  is what you're doing  I also dealt to  his dog walker  yeah but that doesn't matter  that has nothing  to do with anything  no one knows  who that is  alright  call us back  alright  call me every 10 seconds  love you buddy  when you went to the part  where Eric said  that Alec Baldwin  that was the only clip 
[02:10:00]  on there  the only reason why  we played it  to hear the fake Alec Baldwin  he said Alec Baldwin  actually said something  to him  he said that right  he did  he did right  yeah  Iraq is  a liar  good luck to you  Todd show  that's it  good luck  good luck  to you  we got some fighters  coming in next  Uriah Hall  and Demetrius Johnson  very cool  what are they promoting  Black History Month  for the UFC  Black History Month  for the UFC  forgot it was February  why is Black History Month  sort of subdued this month

[02:12:30]  there's a photo  it says hashtag  the Todd show  and then a photo  pops up  that says  what do you call  two Mexicans  playing basketball  and then a photo  of a jolly  Mexican man  with a big sombrero  and under it  it says  Juan on Juan  it's just stupid  right  yeah it's stupid  I don't know why  this is trending  the Todd show  it's trending  alright  we got some UFC guys  next  stay there  very cool  we're back 
[02:13:00]  gentlemen  what's up man  how you doing  good  welcome to the  shoes  I know you  how are you  Demetrius Johnson  and Uriah Hall  in the studio  from the UFC  very cool  man  how are you guys  uh oh  what happened  what's up  just laughing  Uriah immediately  stuck Demetrius  who's a slight fellow  he stuck him  in the high chair  that chair 
[02:13:30]  does go down  it does go down  I'm actually  just tall  you're a badass  Demetrius is a badass  just a man  trying to pay my bills  holy fuck  you're a good fighter man  holy shit  yeah you're the  flyweight right  yes  flyweight champion  19 and 2  one of the best fighters  in the world  mighty mouse  right  is the nickname  right  yeah  mighty mouse  it is though  I know  it's badass  that was one of the  what the UFC event 
[02:14:00]  was that  uh it was an amazing fight  I'm trying to remember  who  which one  for Demetrius  yeah yeah  please help us  just with Joseph Benavides  when he knocked him out  in Sacramento  in December  yeah yeah yeah  that's the one  yeah  that was a solid fight  who are you  who am I  look at you  I just recognized you  Karen Bryant  yeah  what  no I don't know  her by name  I recognize her  of course  but I didn't know  if she was coming in  I would have fucking  googled and said  oh he wrote her name down  but you're recognizable  I know who you are 
[02:14:30]  and you work for Fox  I do yeah  and I also have my own  company MMA Heat  but yeah I do a lot  of the interviews  and stuff with them  on Fox  so you should interview them  we'll just watch you  yeah you guys  would just take five  we have no problem  with that  we've been doing this  a long time  what happened to you guys  what happened to Ariel Hawane  he was like a big name  is he still with  does he still do stuff  for UFC or no  because I heard he's out  and I heard he's still  doing stuff  no he's still doing stuff  he just had his 
[02:15:00]  second baby I believe  so he's been a little  busy with that  but other than that  he's still  he's trying to get rid  of the baby weight  before he comes back  to fighting then right  he's a very  he's a weird looking guy  he's kind of like  Middle Eastern looking  yeah he's a very good  UFC guy  but I heard he got booted  I heard he's back  he's a weird looking  Middle Eastern guy  yeah but I'm saying  I don't know if he wants  to be known as a guy  I'm like no comment  yeah  I'm drinking water  yeah that's a good way  to avoid saying something  where are you from 
[02:15:30]  in New York  right now I'm in Brooklyn  I'm originally from Queens  but I've stayed in Manhattan  for a while  now I'm in Brooklyn  so I'm trying to figure  some stuff out  how much of that UFC  because you did a great job  in the UFC house  and you came out  I think second right  you lost the finals  yeah  but it looked like  you were kind of isolated  from the other guys  and kind of had trouble  getting along with the other guys  but how much of that  is editing  it could just be editing  or are you actually  kind of a loner  oh man  you know for me 
[02:16:00]  when we all watched it  it was kind of  it was new for me too  but you know  some things were thrown  out of context  in certain ways  or whatever  and looking back now  it's like  maybe it was good  for TV or whatever  but you know  when your friends  know who you are  you really don't have  to explain yourself  so I think maybe  some of it was editing  yeah reality TV  is so weird  it's like they want  people to be real  but they feel like  they have to get a story  line  and I guess  with the fighting house  the interesting part  is that people  are actually going to fight  that to me  is what reality TV  should be  right  you know 
[02:16:30]  but just living there  it messes with you  sometimes man  because you know  you don't have  any other outlet  it's just you  people you have to fight  you have to live with them  and food and alcohol  and you know  I was explaining to them  a game of checkers  or chess  could be one of the most  you know serious things  because that's all you have  right  and it's all alphas too  it's all fucking guys  who literally  settle things with their fists  so I'm surprised  I'm surprised  there's not more fist fights  and things in that house  is there a rule  that you're actually  booted for real  if you have a fist fight  I believe so  I don't remember  well yeah  I mean they told us 
[02:17:00]  hey man  don't fight in the house  stuff like that  save for the ring  plus you know  you don't want to be stupid  and you know  ruin your chance  get an injury or something  right  kicked off the show  pan through the wall  you hit a 2x4  in there  nice  I would do that  so I didn't have to fight  like I would just  punch the refrigerator  and get an injury  and be like  oh fuck  I'd love to  I'd love to fight you  but  nah Dana will give you the speech man  he'll make you feel bad  if you did that  yeah  is he an intimidating guy  to work for  what's that  intimidating guy to work for  oh he's a cool guy man  at the end of the day  he's a businessman  but you know  I know Dana personally  and you know  he's a cool guy 
[02:17:30]  to hang out with  and I love him  he's cool  he's my boss  yeah I guess that's really bad  to ask guys on the radio  what is your boss like  I love my boss  he's such an awesome guy  he really is though  he really is a cool guy  and you guys are cool  we love him  yeah we love him too  he comes in here a lot  he's honest man  you need that  he's honest  he takes care of us  god damn  he takes care of us  yeah it's very rare in sports  we have people that are actually nice to us  it is weird when you see him on TV  kind of unloading on something  that he's not happy about  and you kind of look like  wow people don't do that 
[02:18:00]  you know  they usually hold back  say the right things  and stuff  he'll just  you know  he'll say hey  he'll tell you how it is  yeah well  people love hearing from him  when we film him  you know after  a press conference  when he does his scrum  where he really breaks it down  that  I literally will have people  you know tweeting me  all night long  where's the scrum  where's the scrum  and they freak out  because a lot of times  he drops all kinds of news nuggets  that he's not supposed to tell you yet  because he's fired up from the night  and he'll announce fights  he's not supposed to announce  or this or that 
[02:18:30]  so that is  one of the best things  you could possibly film  when Dana's on a rant like that  or just you know  even when he's in a good mood  but especially when he's in a bad mood  it's amazing  like when Chael was supposed to be  a big secret that Chael is doing  the ultimate fighter in Brazil  because there's a tremendous security threat  there are guys that really want to kill him in Brazil  and then it was a big secret  until Dana went out and just said it  like you know  he got like $200,000 worth of security  for fucking Chael Sonny  because Dana just couldn't help himself  he had to spit it out there  he will make anything  man he'll talk about this bottle 
[02:19:00]  he'll be like  man that's the coolest bottle I've ever  he'll make anything  he can sell anything  he can sell it  absolutely  but he also speaks for fans too  because if a fight stinks  he says it  and I like that  like you watch something  you're like  yeah that fight wasn't that great  yeah  and he'll come right out  and he'll go  that sucked  I was unhappy with it  like you feel like  alright  well the guy's being honest with me  about you know  what he was good  and what wasn't good  very rare  honesty is very rare  in entertainment  yeah it is  nobody  they always tow the company line  right  gotta make it sound like  it's the greatest thing ever 
[02:19:30]  when everyone knows it was shit  it was shit  so it's kind of refreshing  but in general  I mean  the UFC product  is not shit  so  there's always  there's a few duds  here and there  but man  there's a few duds  there are right  you guys know it  I wasn't very happy  with Saturdays  gotta be honest  huh  I wasn't very happy  with the pay-per-view Saturday  because what was it  the stoppages  the one stoppage  that went too long  and the one that was too fast  yeah it was just  kind of  yeah  it was there  I liked watching  the you know  the chicks  yeah  that chick will beat your butt 
[02:20:00]  I know  she's been on the show  believe me  she's fantastic man  what a pisser  she's a lot of fun  she's intense  to have a hangout  yeah yeah  she's legit man  she's hilarious  and she's really  like she armbarred me  and you know  because she's such a beautiful girl  and the feeling is so nice  but it was really  is that great  but as soon as you go to  arm bar mode  it's very  exactly  I wrote with her man  and it wasn't fun  yeah  wasn't as beautiful  huh Jimmy  no not at all  you forget she's a woman 
[02:20:30]  men don't take it easy  on a woman like that  when you spar do you  uh for me  I mean  I've never sparred  somebody the highest caliber  like run around  sees as a woman  um  but  my saying is that  I'll hit you as hard  as you hit me  and you know  if she came back  with some heat  then I'll try to blast her  that's great  no  but she honestly  would probably want you to  right  she would want  yeah that's the thing  she'd be insulted  if you were holding that  exactly  and that's the thing too  like  you know  Ronna Rousey 
[02:21:00]  she's on a different planet  so you know  I'm pretty sure  when she goes at guys  I mean  Uriah  has spent time with her  and he can  vouch for her  yeah  she  yeah  yeah  we'll just  yeah  not talking shit  I might say  I'm a blast  I'm just saying  like  if we were to spar  if she would have hit me hard  I'd be like  hey  you can back her  you don't have to  it's insulting  yeah  yeah  she's cool  what was your backstory  because I read some interesting stuff  about you  Demetrius Johnson  yeah Demetrius  I'm always wondering  what makes guys  going to this line of work 
[02:21:30]  I went to high school  and I went to college  did it for about two years  and I was working full time  and also training  and my grades started going down  and basically the  I don't want to say instructor  but somebody was like  well you know  your grades are going down  and you have too many things to juggle  so I said  alright  well I got to pay bills  so I'm going to work  and then I started  hitting the bag  and next thing you know  I started training  at AMC Pay Curation  and got hooked up  with Matt Hume  and then fight ever since then 
[02:22:00]  and  did you fight when you were a kid?  no  were you picked on  for being shorter?  yeah  but I didn't care  the best part of that  was that you wanted to say short  but you're like  let me say short  because it's like  a little bit nicer  what it's like  the earth makes not a difference  so that looks good  that looks good  they called me the brave toaster  because when I was in elementary  I had my hair went this way  and then I had a big giant part  and I had waves  and they called it a toaster  so they called me the brave toaster  oh my god  hop some slices in there  yeah exactly 
[02:22:30]  did it look good?  I had waves man  my waves make me seasick  yeah  that was good  we all think we look good  and then you see the pictures years later  I posted one recently  with a mullet  it's not good  oh that's right  but at the time  it was happening  do you get laid in the house at all  or no  in the UFC house  no I don't mean with that  yeah  that's a great  actually different  he just said laid  I don't get laid  but I don't mean with each other  but I mean like  they don't let you out of the house though 
[02:23:00]  oh there's no chance to sneak out  and that's what happened  way way way back when  in the first season  supposedly I think  Stefan Bonner sneaked out  or something  to try to go see a girl  or something  and it was a big deal  and he almost got kicked off the show  and then thank god  they didn't kick him off the show  because that's what  you know  put the place on the map  you know  the fight with Forrest  but no you can't leave  you're on lockdown in there  it's like a prison  with a little bit of privileges  how long are you guys in the house  I was in there for six weeks  six weeks  I think the first season  was like three months maybe  yeah exactly  and then the live season 
[02:23:30]  same thing  the live season  they did eight weeks  or twelve weeks  that's a long time  even six weeks  is a long time  yeah  wow  and if anyone was going to get laid  it should have happened last season  because they had man and woman  I thought it was going to happen  I thought it was going to be rural  but it wasn't  it turned out really good though  that's right  that was the first time  they had  it was Rhonda and Misha Tate  doing it  and they had  I guess men and women  in the house together  but you know  no one's going to try  to have sex  under those circumstances  I mean there's cameras everywhere man 
[02:24:00]  I got to the point  where the camera in the bathroom  I have to call  I'm like hey man  you've got to take that camera down  what the fuck is that about  see I'm just the opposite  because you know what  they might have like  gossip and stuff  and people might go in the bathroom  and talk  but they say hey  we turn it off  I'm like yeah  yeah sure  keep the cameras up high  at least  Jesus  just capture the audio  not what I'm sporting  was there any  any shit you just didn't watch  shown that they  like you can't show that  like you know 
[02:24:30]  whatever you think of reality  there's got to be stuff  that happens  that you just kind of  don't want  you know captured  I don't think they have  much to say over  no no no  I'm not saying you do  but I'm saying  but I think I understand  Jimmy's point  you probably like  oh like I come off  looking like an asshole  yeah  you're probably  you're so aware  you're so aware of the cameras  that you're just  well behaved in general  I bet you  some people don't care  you know  like for me  I was like  you know  let me just be myself  you know  I went on  interview  because they had like  sessions where they put you in the room  they ask us questions  or whatever  and some of the guys were like 
[02:25:00]  hey I ain't scared  and I told them  hey man  I'm scared shitless  you can't  I'm here with a bunch of guys  I got a fight every day  I'm away from home  a lot of isolation  I'm scared to death  so certain things  but I guess  it was me being real  so I guess  a lot of people accepted that  I didn't however  want them to show DeRonda  where I was a video  of her kicking my ass  I said don't show that  and they did  like oh it's good  that's gold right there  but it was funny  so whatever  how long does it take  before you don't even  notice the cameras anymore  because the first day  you're like fuck  look at all these 
[02:25:30]  you just know  you have to  but when do you finally  just say  you know  screw it  with the cameras  I'd say for me  it was in training  oh really  I just forgot about  the cameras  but when you're back  in the house  you're aware again  it's more like  when conversations  come up  see all the red lights  going  oh this might be good  yeah  some dirt  it was cool though  what exactly  are you guys promoting  Black History Month  for the UFC  but what is the UFC  doing for it  for Black History Month  basically 
[02:26:00]  going around  to different  major cities  and just  getting involved  and basically  launching a Black History Month  tour  yeah  we're going to do  some things  at the Boys and Girls Club  later  I think what it is  is a lot of young folks  maybe don't understand  that MMA  is an option for them  I think a lot of young guys  are indoctrinated with boxing  which is great  and find boxing  as a way  a way out  or a way  to support your life  but these two gentlemen  right here  are perfect role models  but also it's just a way  to raise awareness  because it's weird  you know 
[02:26:30]  I obviously go to  a lot of fights  and I'm in the audience  I'm looking around  I'm like  I'm surprised  that there aren't  more black folks  in here  like you know  what's the deal  and so  I mean  I'm just a little bit  surprised  so maybe  they're just not  as aware  of the sport  as an option  or think it's something  that they could get  into themselves  maybe a lot of time  I think when stuff  gets to the ground  with wrestling  and jujitsu  a lot of people  are turned off  so when you have  these guys out here  who are able to go out  and explain that  and help you know  inform the fan base  and let them know  that you know  this is an option 
[02:27:00]  that they could go  and do in their own life  too  I think that's great  and you brought up  a good point  like I remember  when I first started  wrestling in high school  I mean middle school  like I was the only  you know  black guy on there  and then when I went  to high school as well  I was still  pretty much the only black guy  I would go to the  wrestling tournaments  you know  I was a black guy  with the same pair of shoes  I had when I was  in middle school  because you know  I came from you know  poor beginnings  and so  it's exactly  what mixed martial arts  you know  I think a lot of people  are  misunderstood that  like oh  they're wrestling  oh that's only you know  for you know 
[02:27:30]  not  because you say  I'm the African American  but there's a lot  of African American fighters  in the UFC  or around the world  that love to do  mixed martial arts  and I think we're trying  to do a good job  of spreading the word  that hey  it's not only boxing  that African Americans  are good at  or not just mixed martial arts  it's you know  any athletic sport  that we try to do  especially too  when you look at  you know  obviously football  but we've got  John Jones  who's our  light heavyweight champion  he's got one brother  on the Ravens  and one brother  on the Patriots  which is my team  but it's great  I mean it's  is he the brother  on the Patriots  I didn't know that 
[02:28:00]  Chandler  I thought he only had  one of them  he's number 95  and he's awesome  he plays defense  he's great  but I just think  it's kind of cool  especially in their family  they're this little  microcosm of what  what an athlete  can achieve  he's you know  got one brother  with a ring  already  you know  Arthur has a ring  John's a champ  and you know  I just think  that's a hell of a family  you're kidding  right  is there any  non-athletes  in that family  I don't think so  it's amazing  but I just think  it's cool for people  to see that this  is an option  MMA is an option  and like you said  martial arts is an option  and I  you know  if you have  if you have kids 
[02:28:30]  it teaches them  good discipline  you know  it's obviously  good physical training  for them  there's just a lot  of real benefits  from it  it's like the one  like Peyton Manning's  brother  like there's Peyton  you know  there's this one  brother isn't there  yeah  is it Cooper Manning  besides he  that's not  who's not  an overachiever  oh boy no  there's one Manning  who just fucking  basks in their glory  works in an office  it's a shitty job  it's gonna suck  for him  yeah  you know  that fourth Jones  brother  how much that must  suck to have  two brothers  in the NFL  and one guy  is the light  heavyweight champion 
[02:29:00]  but the Manning  father too  so the father  was in the NFL  then he got  two brothers  in the NFL  and what do you  talk about  when they all  come together  the whole table  talks about their glory  and then one guy  will remember  oh yeah  he's here  oh yeah  so what's going on  tell us about you  how's the work  oh it's alright  you know  but back to you  just make me feel polite  oh so you got a new  copy machine  yeah  yeah exactly  how's that boss  fucking awful  he probably does  something cool  we just don't know  maybe he's an agent 
[02:29:30]  or something  I don't know  he's probably involved  in some peripheral  who knows  do you guys have brothers  uh for me  it's five boys  two girls  yeah  see cause Rogan  that's us  that's my family  five and two  five and two  yeah five boys  two girls  Rogan mentioned  something about this  uh like I think  it was Rashad  that says there  was guys who  were fighting  getting beat up  when they're kids  by the older brother  a lot of those  guys go into fighting  cause you're  you're in confrontations  from the time  you're very very small  where I had  I had a younger sister  so I you know  I never had  well Joe also said  there's a lot  of abuse too  what 
[02:30:00]  as I not look  at these guys  when I say  it's more than  an older sibling  or something  beating them up  there's actual  real serious  abuse from parents  and relatives  and stuff  which makes guys  there can be  well and also  do you know that  well yeah  I know for a fact  that there's some  people uh  when you talk  about like  Court McGee  people who were  deep into drugs  and MMA  saved their life  right  he goes around  now and talks  about that  I mean the guy  I'm almost  pretty sure  was certifiably  dead you know  at one point  uh and and  came back  it's it's it's  it's a way 
[02:30:30]  that people have  found uh to  kind of straighten  their life out  for sure  definitely  who bullied you  I was bullied  in school  um you know  I just came to  the states  and was just  new to a lot  of things  and that was  like the first  thing I was  I didn't know  it and I  didn't know  what it was  cause in Jamaica  where I'm from  we don't get  bullied I didn't  know what that  is  everybody was just  cool and fiery  and it was like  hey man why  are you wearing  dead I'm like  what  they really  don't they  don't bully  in Jamaica  no you know  it's funny my  mom's Jamaican  too and what  what she always 
[02:31:00]  tells me is  is in Jamaica  like the smart  kids are the  heroes of the  class and the  ones that are  the achievers  are the heroes  and here you  know you're  kind of put  down oh look  at you smarty  pants you know  it's just a  different it's  a different  mindset there  what part of  Jamaica  uh St.  Catherine  is that different  than Kingston  yeah yeah I  imagine there's  some bullying  in Kingston  probably  yeah  tell you what  though you  teachers man  they'll bust  your butt  you know  right  here you  can't over  there you  can't talk  back to  teachers  like when  I first  heard you  can talk  back to  teachers  and nothing 
[02:31:30]  happens  or you can  get grounded  by your  parents  and nothing  that's kind  of a new  thing though  back yeah  when I was  going to school  you didn't talk  back to the  teachers  like they would  have complete  permission to  just punch  you in the  face  and your  parents would  then punch  you  because you  made the  teacher punch  you  I would  get three  butt whooping  man  the teacher  my dad  would come  up and beat me  there  and then wait  till we get  home  right  she can't  wait for 
[02:32:00]  everyone else  to weaken  you though  and it should  be the third  one  get her  beating  in  I don't think  Jamaican guys  got fucked  with  I remember  in school  when I was  a kid  the Jamaican  guys  or anybody  with an  accent  that came  because you  just assumed  that they  could fight  like an  Asian  kid  nobody  fucked  with  an  Asian 
[02:32:30]  I got  you just  assumed  so badly  by a  Chinese  kid  I was  I don't  even know  if he  could fight  or not  I was  fucking  walking  with my  two  friends  and he  was  riding  on his  bike  and we  knew him  he was  quiet  and I  threw a snowball  at him  and it smashed  by the bike  and he turned  around  and there  was three  of us  and he  goes  who  throws  a snowball  have you  seen  Frank 
[02:33:00]  I was  looking  for a  buddy  like  I  didn't  think  this guy  could  fight  or not  he  probably  couldn't  when I  was  growing  up  all  an  Asian  kid  had  to  know  was  how  to  stand  like  one  stance  and he  just went  on  he  obviously  knows  that's  all he  had to  learn  was how  to  make  that  one  square  off  stance  and no  one  was  going  to  fuck  with  everybody  just  assuming  they  know  math  yeah  yeah  that  they  all knew  math  when we  were  growing  up  yeah  that's 
[02:33:30]  always  been  there  that's  funny  yeah  but  no one  messed  with  kids  who  you  thought  might  be  able  to  fight  a new  kid  came  to  school  from  Jamaica  I  never  did you  do much  fighting  in school  no  Jimmy  I  could assume  no  I got beat up  man  you did  really  yeah  jeez  you should  look some  names up  and knock  on some  doors  for me  remember  me  with martial  arts  especially  and  that's  one of the  great thing  it did  it changed  my demeanor  you know  I'm  not aggressive  I'm more 
[02:34:00]  served  so  it changed  that  I ran  into  people  you know  picked  on me  and  oh my  god  you're  doing  this  I'm  like  yeah  it's  none  of  that  I  don't  really  focus  on  that  it's  not  good  for  you  how long  were you  in school  how long  had you come  to the  States  before  the  first  confrontation  happened  with another  student  maybe  the second  day  it was  like  in the  jungle  here  you go  survive  it was  nuts  you look  back  now  and I'm  like  well  I wasn't 
[02:34:30]  happy  to  but it  kind of  morphed  me  into  where  I  am  today  anything  that  happens  to  you  kind  of  makes  you  who  you  are  now  so  hopefully  you learn  from it  or whatever  grow  from it  still sucks  though  but something's  got to motivate  you don't want to do  that  it's like  there's got to be  humiliations  or beatings  or things  that make you  want to stand  up  and  you know  it was a way  for me  to channel  that energy  into something  positive  constructive  and  you know  my mom  found out  I was cutting  class  because I  didn't want  to go  because  you know  I didn't  want to  go  so when  they found 
[02:35:00]  out  and my mom  was yelling  at me  and I broke  down  I told her  hey man  this is what's  happening  and she finally  put me into  martial arts  and I just  ran with it  and I couldn't  wait  and the funny  thing is  you know  I would go  to school  with my bag  and they  would see me  like oh  it's that  karate guy  so all of a sudden  I got this  yeah okay  yep  so I felt  cool  no one messing  me then  then I became  like the popular  kid-ish  with the non-popular  kid  and you know  right  right  nobody fucks  now because  everybody takes  mixed martial arts  that's like the  thing to do  so you can't 
[02:35:30]  nobody  like first  thing you do  is look at  somebody's ears  and you see  if they have  any type of  scarring  any scarring  in the ear  so I got a funny  story  so I  you know  I'm a huge  video game  I like to play  video games  and I'm with  a GameStop  and I was  going to buy  a new game  and you know  I'm a quiet  guy  don't like to  be bothered  with  you know  I just like  to do me  and I'm at  the store  and I'm looking  at you know  the games  I'm just sitting  there and my  ears are sticking  out  and this guy  goes huh  man I'm not  going to mess  with you  and I'm like  what's going  on he goes  my dad told 
[02:36:00]  me about  people like  you and I'm  like  what the hell  you mean  what do you  mean you people  what kind of  accent did he  have  hey I want  to talk to  you  and he looked  at my ears  he goes  your ears  they're  they're  qualified  and I was  like yeah  she's from  wrestling man  and he goes  oh you seem  very intelligent  you seem  very nice  you don't  seem like  a guy who's  just going  to tear  my head  off  and I was  like dude  it's a sport  that I do  I love to  wrestle  and even in  mixed martial  arts today  you know  people see  my ears  and that's 
[02:36:30]  the first  thing that  gravitates  them  that lets  them know  that I do  mixed martial  arts  but other  than that  if you come  to my house  or you know  if I was  to go  grocery shop  with me  you would  never know  I fight  and you know  it's just  a stereotypical  thing  can I  let me see  the  oh yeah  that's definitely  a wrestler  definitely  I actually  want to get  prosthetics like  that to put on  so nobody  fucks with me  that would be a  great thing to sell  so nobody bothers  you to bar  who hits on your  chick  that's a tell  though  you don't fuck  with people like that  you can't you  drain that  you have to be 
[02:37:00]  vigilant and drain it  every time it  happens and then  that won't happen  but as soon as  you let it go  and it kind of  hardens  and the thing  is too  we had a guy  that is correct  but for me  I plan on doing  something like 35  or however long  my body lasts  and you think  about draining it  every single time  it's just a waste  of time  if you ask me  we had a guy  who actually  had his cauliflower  and he went  and got surgery on it  like to prevent it  shit blew right back up  really  you gotta put a needle  in I think  and suck the blood out  but is there something  you can do  when the fighting days  are over 
[02:37:30]  nope  I mean I'm pretty sure  nowadays  with technology  being so far in advance  I can go  get some cadaver ears  from a black man  and spit on my ears  but  I mean  at the end of the day  this is who I am  I mean this is how  my ears are  I don't know  if you guys remember  obviously you remember  Kimbo Slice  but he fought  this guy James Thompson  when we first had  some fights  like on CBS  and James Thompson  had this huge  giant cauliflower ear  and he walked in the room  and we're all doing  the pre-fighting interviews  and stuff  and we're like  dude  you gotta drain that thing  right  no no no  it'll be fine 
[02:38:00]  of course  Kimbo just went out there  and hunted the ear  and so it was a question  of when  and they sure enough  punched it  it exploded  it was blood everywhere  it was gross  oh man  so please  straighten them Demetrius  please  well  and see  mine are all  calcified  yeah  so it's not  so liquidy  so no more liquid  and it can't get  any more liquidy  anymore  it's like  it's to the max  it's done  it speaks like  cast iron  it doesn't affect  your hearing at all  right  nope  oh you were supposed 
[02:38:30]  to say what  yeah  what  the only way  I wear headphones  like I can't wear  you know  the standard  like iPhone  the earbud  the earbud  I have to have  one that actually  go in there  because the hole  is very small  dude  I got shitty ear holes  you're not alone  well you should see too  you know when  these guys come on  the air with us  at Fox  and they come and do  the you know  they need the little  IFB  all of these guys  have to get custom ones  because the regular ones  they just pop out  because the guys  have ear holes anymore  you fucking tape it  around from the outside  I can't keep it in there 
[02:39:00]  when I'm working out  you can't listen to anything  because it pops out  are they big or small  your ear holes  ah it's just shitty  this one's tiny or something  I don't know  what the fuck's going on  the left one's alright though  the left one looks  like a rock star  but  you know the big headphones  are back in style though  right  you just made a beast  by Dre or whatever  that's true  beats by Dre  I would wear the  octagon monster headphones  I would never  why would I wear  the octagon headphones  the day has set me  for free  they gave us beats  but they're too bassy 
[02:39:30]  for radio  and we've lost our hearing  from doing this  for so fucking long  I can't hear in a  god damn restaurant anymore  I just enjoy my  tinnitus at night  staring at the ceiling  and hearing hissing noises  but it's good not to hear  people trust me  especially the restaurant  babbling about  some horses  just not a lot  yeah  whenever their lips  stop moving  you just shake  your head  like oh  good point  I can zilch  are there certain  people that you'll fight  that you want to  hit a little more 
[02:40:00]  than other people  depends  shut out  no no  he's talking  this is his  thanks Demetrius  well you know  when I was on the show  there was one guy  that got on my skin  a little bit  and at the given time  when there's no other  outlet like I said  before  small stuff will get to you  and I really want  to punch him in the face  you know  now  it's whatever man  if I'm going to go out there  and I'm going to fight anyways  I'm going to punch you anyways  so  you're not overthinking  no extra pleasure 
[02:40:30]  when you get a good one in  and go  yeah  I deserve that  if you smack talk  yeah  I'm going to let you  I'm just going to wait  to get in there  and for me  I like to keep to myself  like  there's people in the past  have said things to me  and they don't realize  that it got to me  and you remember it  and I remember it  and when I get it in  I'm like  yep  but you know  it can work against them too  you know  if you're too emotional  sometimes the guy  you know  you kind of lose your game plan  oh yeah  that's one reason  I don't like it  yeah  when you look at Misha 
[02:41:00]  and Rhonda  you know  Misha was so  emotional about it  you know  the first time  and stuff  and so  it was difficult  for her to get past  you know  wanting to just  meet her  for that reason  you know  sometimes you forget  I got to tell you  something about that fight  she looks so scared  walking into that  Misha  the second one you think  Misha  looked fucking frightening  yeah she looked nervous  really nervous  you could just tell  well it's tough  because the first time  she fought her  you know  Rhonda was  still coming up  and stuff  and Rhonda won that fight  and so the good thing 
[02:41:30]  for me  she was saying  oh cool  I know what to expect  now for the second time  but the only problem  is now I know  what to expect  you know  that's a little bit  more intense  and Rhonda  you know  got even better  and then there's  the emotional element  and they're wanting  to avenge the first loss  there was a lot going on  she was trying to enjoy  her little Katy Perry song  and I knew she wasn't  enjoying it  she was faking it  man  no I'm just enjoying  this song  yeah man  she looked  I haven't seen a fighter  look that scared  man getting ready  for a fight  well I think it's  you know credit  to Rhonda Rousey  you know Rhonda Rousey  has so many things  going on in her life 
[02:42:00]  with you know  the movies  she's fighting  and you know  her also getting better  and you can see  in that second fight  her and Misha Tate  Misha Tate got in there  and she goes  oh my god  like she's gotten better  this is not  the same person I fought  and when she got  thrown around  and by the third round  you know  when that arm  I got latched on  you can see in her face  like  I don't want to say  she gave up  but you know  she could have  fight a little more  but it was like  this fight's not going  the thing that's crazy  too is Misha's so good 
[02:42:30]  she can beat up  a lot of people  oh I believe it  I'm not taking anything  away from her  we want both of them  we've had her both on  oh no see the energy  that was the  silver wideband too  and the energy  when Rhonda and Misha  came out  it was more intense  for them  than it was for Anderson  and I couldn't believe  this fucking  build up to this  because Rhonda Rousey  has the best  walkout face  in mixed martial  no one has a meaner  walkout face  and you don't look  at like wow  look at the girl  and you're like 
[02:43:00]  this is a fucking brute  she has a very  very intense walkout face  she has a best song too  what's that song  it's a Joan Dent song  Bad Reputation  oh yeah  that's perfect  it's her face  in that song  because she doesn't  do a thing  and Silva looked  kind of strange  when he was walking  out too  he was emotional  that night  what was it  when he looked  unsure  or something was  going on  the last time  Anderson Silva  came off a loss  was you know  when these kids  were in second grade  I mean  you know  he had been  a winner  for so long  and that was  really intense 
[02:43:30]  and he stopped  on the way out  a couple times  even Rogan  was a little confused  by what he was doing  yeah it was different  from the Anderson  we've usually seen  Joe said something  like there's sometimes  when a guy beats you  or does something  like there's some guys  that can walk it off  and there's other times  it feels like someone  has taken a piece  of your soul  and he said that  that might have been  the effect that had  on him  and just like  Karen brought up  like you know  he was you know  I think the last time  I think I saw  and civil loss  like legitly  is when Rio Shun  jumped on his knee  and did a heel hook  and from then  I don't remember him losing 
[02:44:00]  and for a man  to you know  carry so much  of that you know  pressure of him being  I still believe  he's the greatest  of all time  and you look at  his highlight reel  I mean  he's just done things  that nobody's done  in the octagon  and him to you know  come off a loss  and go back in there  and fight Chris Ryden  again  to prove  like he probably felt  like he had to prove  something himself  and everybody to the world  and him taking that stop  and like okay  because when you walk  out there I mean  I tell you right  you know to this day  like there's no feeling  like when I walk out there  to get ready to fight  I'm just like  it's time to go fight  and I think to myself 
[02:44:30]  that everybody  in the whole arena  is looking at me  that I'm going to lose  that way it's just like  that's just me  going to my little place  and then I think  that's where he was  trying to do that  and I was like  alright here we go  gotta go out there  and defend you know  show the world  that I can do this  yeah yeah  plus we never know  if maybe  what if he won  maybe he would retire  I mean who knows  what he was really  thinking about  maybe he thought  this could be  the last walk  I don't know  and he's going  to fight again  he wants to  yeah he's walking  without crushes already  Jesus  and I don't know  if I mean  obviously Dana  will let him do 
[02:45:00]  what he wants to do  but I mean  I think for athletes  too you know  once it's in you man  it's hard to kind of  let it go  but his leg  the leg  the leg  how did he come back  from that  but they say  he'll never break it  again though  because there's a piece  of titanium  and it's like  now you could  probably throw that  kick against a wall  and not break it  and the body  will calcify it  like each time  you break a bone  your body will go back  and you know  repair it  and you'll have  like a big giant calcium  so people will break  their hands all the time  like if you were to look  at like me and his  x-rays in our hands  and look at your guys  x-rays  you'll see big giant 
[02:45:30]  calcium deposits  and where we broke  our hands  calling us pussies  basically  and you'll see lady hands  and you'll see my right  hand always curled  like it's wrapped around  something not very large  it just happens  very cool  no you're absolutely  right by the way  seahawks fan  anything  I was actually  I'm more of a  New York Giants fan  but after watching  that game  I was like  damn  talk about perfect play 
[02:46:00]  they played extremely well  I like those guys  now  they're cool  absolutely  cool  you made  fucking Lieben quit  he made a very very  tough guy  Chris Lieben quit  I've never seen that  and he's not a pussy  that guy  he's a brutally tough guy  and you hit him so hard  he thought he was  knocked out  and he said  did I get knocked out  and I'm like no  and he goes  that's it  I'm done  really  he quit on his stool  he was like  I think he waved 
[02:46:30]  didn't he  I don't remember  I just remember  getting ready  around two  and then  they just went like this  no I thought  I thought you  he was against the cage  and like  you had him like this  and you were hitting him  and then they stopped  and he was like  I didn't see that  I just got up  and turned and left  because I was like  five more seconds  was it a kick or a hit  that did it  it was a cross  you know  he's strong  and the game plan  was to move and hit  work a lot of foot movement  and I just kept moving back  looking for timing  I kept searching to his power  because I wanted him to throw it 
[02:47:00]  whenever he throws it  he goes like this  and winds up  and that was like my opening  so I just saw it  and I took it  wow  you could tell  when he was going to throw  one like that  maybe you shouldn't  that guy shouldn't wind up anymore  no  yeah  it's kind of a tell  it's like a tell to have  don't cock your hand twice  before throwing the right  alright look out  here it comes  mixed martial arts man  you're thinking on your feet  you know  but that was  I've never seen that before  I've never actually seen a guy  say I don't want to  and again he's not a guy  that you'd look at  and expect that from  he's a guy who would  I didn't expect that either 
[02:47:30]  I think it was still his first fight  in the UFC  I think it was against Chris Lieben  I could be wrong  yeah it was  so he's been around for a while  and he's you know  you're a bigger guy  than I thought you'd be  by the way  I forgot you were in that weight class  like you've already fought  I was just fat season right now  you know  no your arms are fucking  that's fat season  start working harder  in the gym  Jesus Christ  what do you walk around it  how much  I try to walk around like 205  I don't like to get  some guys walk around like 230  that goes down to 185 
[02:48:00]  I think  wow really  I'm like you're crazy man  but  I like to stay close to my weight  to make it easier  I don't know why guys do that  it seems so kind of productive  to have to lose all that weight  and then fight the next day  well yeah well a lot of times  dude the guys show up to camp  and the first couple weeks to camp  is them losing 15 pounds  so they can start camp  yeah  you know  that makes sense  and a hard thing  like he said you know  like how you guys are talking about  Andrew Silva coming back to fight  it's like  this is all we do  is we fight  like this is the first time  I ever take like two months off  from like 
[02:48:30]  you know  I focus on trying to be a dad  and a good husband  and now I'm like  I'm fucking going crazy  and like now  when I go back to the gym  it's like  it feels normal  and like  now I'm back on my training schedule  it's almost like normal  it's life for me  so I couldn't imagine  you just were 10 years straight  and then  next thing you know  you're 38  and it's like  oh  I'm retired  and now I got  hopefully 40 more years  left in my life  what the hell am I going to do  what am I going to do  with it  yeah  what do you do  it's like guys like Tito  and then  and Rampage  who just don't want  it's hard to give it up 
[02:49:00]  they go over it  and start fighting  for someone else  but then like  Liddell is a guy  like okay  like Rondo will always  have something  in mixed martial arts  Chuck does  those are like  spokespeople for the  sport  but like what do you do  if you're not doing that  or announcing  well even now  you know Ronda  set herself up  already  you know one of the things  that I can respect  about Ronda  is that you know  she told a story  about when she went  to the Olympics  when she was  getting ready for the Olympics  she goes  I'm going to be  a champion in the Olympics  and then when she got  down to the Olympics  she got her bronze medal  she goes  alright  sounds good 
[02:49:30]  but now she's like  you know  I'm going to use  mixed martial arts  to catapult me  to something else  so after I'm done  with mixed martial arts  I don't need  mixed martial arts  she's already doing movies  you know  I'm going to go see  Fast and Furious 7  just because she's in it  or you know  the Expendables  I don't even care  about the Expendables  just because she's in it  I just want to see it  yeah  so she's already  getting herself  to her  I don't want to say  her exit plan  but if she's like  you know what  I'm done  yeah yeah  she can do something  but not every fighter  is going to be able  to you know  do it that way  a lot of them  you know  will open up a gym  or something  put the name behind a gym  I know Rich Franklin 
[02:50:00]  actually  he's not 100% retired  he's got one fight  left in his contract  but he has a juice shop  out in Beverly Hills  now  it's a nice spot  you know  I mean  hopefully it does well  but you know  he's a smart guy  investing in some other  things in his life  so  Gina Carano  is supposed to be  like the woman  that did that stuff  she was doing  action movies  she's got more movies  coming out  but Ronda just seems  to be the one  that everybody looks at  like she's the face  of  right  she's got the timing  now you know  when Gina was doing this  it wasn't as big yet  and you know  and people were not 
[02:50:30]  as comfortable yet  watching women  and Gina was great  but now Ronda  you know  the timing  everything's kind of  coming together  really nicely  Ronda's such a good  guest on the show  she actually convinced  me I might have a shot  I certainly didn't  Jimmy  I don't know  you never know  maybe take her out  no way  maybe like they get  sick of the fighters  maybe I go out  with another guy  you know  you get tired  of looking at  those perfect bodies  she's really nice  but that is  that is the worst  it's not just  the fight  it's the fact  that the guys  are in shape  I mean  obviously I go to the gym 
[02:51:00]  as well  but it's just not  on that level  commitment  alright well  I like both of you guys  yeah we're good  man  this was great  I want to promote  both of these guys  and their Twitters  Uriah Hall  is obviously  U-R-I-A-H  Hall  MMA  is his Twitter  and Demis  what is your  it's good  Mighty Mouse UFC  I'm just glad  Demis  that would have been  way too hard to spell  and when are you  fighting again  you're one of the  best fighters in the world  I love watching you  I'm just 
[02:51:30]  I have no idea  you know right now  I'm just  getting back in the gym  keep on improving  working on some new  stuff on my game  I'm with Matt Hume  and it's whenever  the UFC calls  okay  and Uriah  when are you  fighting again  I'm the same  I mean I'm a little  injured  and I'm working  on some stuff too  so as soon as I  get up situated  then I'm jumping  back on that  cool  I was watching your video  of how to throw  a back kick  and I think  I got it  see I never  I always did it wrong  I think I got it  you gotta look at  your target  and then you spin  and while you're  still spinning  you see the target 
[02:52:00]  again and then  you allow your foot  to kind of whip around  there you go  he's in the bathroom  he goes okay  I'm looking at the mirror  I see myself  yeah yeah  yes  you got him  wait we just learned  that wasn't a joke  on Jimmy's point  he's really studying  yeah you have to  see cause I would have  thought to throw a back  like a spinning  hook kick  you have to  just spin  and hope the foot  hits where it's  supposed to hit  you gotta see your target  but you have to look  and you turn  and then you look  and you see it again  and that's when you  allow the foot  to whip around  for someone like you  I'd recommend a gun  yeah  exactly 
[02:52:30]  no no I'm actually  gonna but I would  probably do it too slow  I would actually stop  and then turn around  and stop  and look  and then try to spin my foot  don't move  I got to  stay there  don't move  keep your head steady  I'll be right back around  your head would come around  just in time to see a big fist  right in front of your face  oh shit  yeah the guy would  catch my leg  and rip it off  and fucking beat me with it  can we see you do that  Jimmy  no I'm not  my jeans are too tight  oh is that it  yeah  whenever we have fighters  coming in  I wear tight clothes  so I look like  at least I'm in the fucking game  I look like I'm not a man 
[02:53:00]  to be tangled with  yeah good  but uh  you know  good luck to both of you guys  man  thanks a lot  thank you guys  thank you  that was fun  thanks guys  alright  what's that  do you want  we're doing interviews  for Chippa TV  on the YouTubes  about the UFC event  who did you want to see  who are your favorite  like fighters  and kickboxers  and karate guys  and judo guys

[02:55:00]  I  I  I  I saw Blossom in the hallway.  Really?  I saw Blossom.  What's her name?  Is she the one from...  She's on that other show now.  That show that we don't like?  Yeah, the Big Bang Theory. 
[02:55:30]  The Big Bang Theory.  Yeah.  Where would she go?  Did you say hi?  No, she came around the corner.  Right.  And I saw her real quick and I was like, ah, it was Blossom.  Hey, you're the Blossom brunt.  That's Blossom.  Right.  So you know the child of the 80s, you know her as Blossom.  Of course I do.  But everybody else now, you know her as, you know.  Didn't she like leave show business and go to school and shit and actually get an education?  Yeah.  Was she the one that grew boobies or that was the other one?  That was Soleil Moon Frye from Punky Brewster. 
[02:56:00]  There you go.  Punky Brewster.  Punky Brewster was the one that went away from Hollywood and grew boobies.  Punky grew some big, giant Punky pits.  Meat wagons.  Oh, they were giant.  She had to get breast reduction or something.  Yep.  Yeah.  That's what she looks like now.  Punky was always pretty hot.  The punkster.  No.  What?  No, Punky was, once she got older, she wasn't bad at all.  She was pre-surgery, man.  Whoa.  Jesus.  What the fuck? 
[02:56:30]  Just big, giant fucking tits.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So, the NFL wants to do this 15-yard penalty thing.  This is crazy.  The N-word on the field.  Yeah, this is crazy.  She's a nigger on the field, the 15-yard penalty.  Like, that's...  Jesus Christ.  Why not other things?  Yeah, why...  Like, why not kike or spick or, like, you know?  Well, because...  I guess they don't use those words.  Those words aren't really used.  It's a lot of black guys, and I guarantee, after every play, the word is used.  You know, white guy says none on the field. 
[02:57:00]  I guarantee, after every play...  Right, right.  You're right.  Every play.  Every play.  Yeah.  And it's a sport where every play they're trying to pretty much take your head off.  Yeah.  That's okay.  They know there's a concussion problem, so they'll try to pay off some of the old guys  to make it go away, but they're not really doing anything significant, I think significant.  They are trying some things to make sure that these guys aren't getting, you know, all these 
[02:57:30]  concussions, which, you know, leaves them later in life just fucking miserable, basically.  Yep.  But, say the N-word, and we're going to penalize you 15 yards.  That is...  It's so...  What's the purpose of it?  What is their take on it as to why this needs to be addressed?  Well, obviously, the Miami Dolphins situation.  I guess they're trying to show they're being proactive or whatever.  Yeah, the white guy.  The white guy.  What is the black guys?  It's the fake...  That's why the NFL stinks.  It's the black guys saying it to the other black guys. 
[02:58:00]  The other black guys.  On the field, probably every play.  Yeah.  Right.  We should ask Tyson Walter this one.  Yep.  Because he played.  We have a very good friend.  But he's a white guy.  Yeah, but he would hear it.  Oh, man.  He was a center.  Yeah.  The center of the action.  He probably...  I would love to know if that word is thrown around a lot.  I bet it's a lot of like...  In the NFL.  A lot of after you fucking, you know, tackle somebody.  It's like you ain't...  Smack talk.  You ain't got shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Shit like that.  All that crap.  All that trash talk.  Yeah.  Come on.  Bring it, nickel.  Right.  This is why I love the fact that Redskins...  Because the problem is they should...  People call me politically correct on Twitter.  Yes, they do.  Amongst other things.  But they're so...  Yeah.  Queer.  Bitch boy.  I can handle all that stuff.  Panty boy.  Bitch boy.  But the fact that anyone thinks I'm being politically correct shows how fucking dumb people are.  It's because the political correctness has gone so far, this is what you get, dummies.  Right.  Like this...  The NFL, if they're going to do this, they have to change the name Redskins. 
[02:59:00]  If they're going to be polite and overly courteous to one group, then they have got to show that same courteous to everyone else.  This is really strange because you would almost understand, I guess, if it was a white guy, but...  Yeah, even that would be like, who cares about...  But it's not...  It's black guys saying it's all the black guys.  And who gives a shit on the field?  It's not like it's going out over the air kind of a thing. 
[02:59:30]  This is really strange to me.  I think it's coming out of fucking nowhere and I don't even see a reason for it.  A groundbreaking move.  The league is expected to agree to start penalizing players 15 yards.  So this is close to happening.  I thought they were sort of just kind of talking about it, but this is close to happening.  Penalizing players 15 yards for uttering the N-word on the field according to the group that monitors diversity in the league.  They monitor diversity in the league? 
[03:00:00]  Utter nonsense.  Oh my God.  So the rule will be likely adopted by the NFL competition committee at the March owners' meetings.  Wow.  I will be totally shocked if the competition committee does not uphold us on what we're trying to do.  We want this war to be police from the parking lot to the equipment room to the locker room.  Oh God.  Anthony again at his own one-yard line. 
[03:00:30]  Starting out again, fourth down.  Fourth and 80.  He's been backed up from the three-yard line of the Dolphins.  No, first and 80 would be the joke, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That probably would work a little better than fourth and 80.  Secretaries, PR people, whoever, we want eliminated completely and wanted policed everywhere.  Wooden expects the NFL to push for an automatic 15-yard penalty for first-time offenders.  A second offense would result in an ejection from the game. 
[03:01:00]  Ejected from the game.  And then you just look like an asshole because now you're being ejected.  So the whole world would go, oh, okay.  Oh, that guy.  I think they're going to do what needs to be done here, he said.  There's too much disrespect in the game.  But you're basically killing each other.  Yeah.  You don't care about the concussions.  You don't give a fuck.  You don't care about the fans.  And why is that the word that they pick?  That's...  Like, yeah. 
[03:01:30]  How about, you know, if someone goes, ah, I'll kill you.  Name the second word that's being used.  No one could do it.  What was the second one?  But I would assume in...  You retort it?  You retort it.  I'd probably.  I'd probably get that one.  I think that's really stupid.  Retired Giants star Harry Carson.  It seems a little fucking...  He seems a little fucking weird.  Mysterious?  No, he's just weird.  Weird?  Okay.  What does weird mean? 
[03:02:00]  I don't know.  He's just...  Mysterious and weird.  There's already this penalty in the league for sportsmanly conduct, so that's what they should  use it under.  Who is now the executive director of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, told the Daily News that  a rule allowing officials to penalize players for using the N-word is already in place.  Oh, yeah?  The word is considered unsportsmanlike conduct.  So when you hear that unsportsmanlike conduct, every once in a while, they catch you saying  the word, I guess.  Already.  It's kind of like, you know what, on the...  And it's weird to say privacy, but it is. 
[03:02:30]  On the privacy of the playing field, when you're down there with the other players and  officials and stuff, and it's not open to the public, they're not hearing what you're  saying, for the most part.  It's like you're getting branded with a scarlet letter now.  Right.  It's like, oh, yeah, well, no one heard it.  Just a team.  But now we're going to point out to everybody that you said that horrible word.  I hope they at least make it fun for the fans, where, you know, when the ref has to step  out.  Oh, my God.  15 yards for saying nigger. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, there it is.  Number 23, defense, 15 yards, nigger.  At least keep it fun, no?  How funny would that be?  Oh, would that be funny?  They're mostly white refs, right?  The white ref has to do that.  And the ref's got to make this giant, like, ring around his head afro thing.  Right.  Like you say, because they need hand signals for all that stuff. 
[03:03:30]  And it's a big afro.  I don't like using the word, unless I think I might get a laugh from it.  They wouldn't say it.  They wouldn't say it.  They'd go, uh...  Unsportsmanlike conduct, number 22, saying that using the penalty decline.  15 yards for saying the jiggaboo work.  You know what it is? 
[03:04:00]  It's because there's microphones on now all over the place.  I think that's the part of it, too.  It's probably been caught on camera a few times.  I don't remember ever seeing it caught on camera.  I don't either, to be honest.  It probably has been.  Every once in a while a fuck or something.  Right.  It's just...  It's really strange.  With all the issues the NFL has,  they're going to tackle this one.  These guys are getting really fucking hurt.  They're monsters now. 
[03:04:30]  They are so much bigger and stronger  than when we were watching football growing up.  They got real fucking problems.  But they're going to go after language again.  Language.  Because they're with the incognito.  That's the problem.  That's the problem.  Language is like words.  And in the locker room,  like the locker room is a safe haven.  For anyone that has played a sport,  that locker room, man,  was a safe haven to just be an asshole.  Just to be an asshole. 
[03:05:00]  Good without saying anything.  Because it's not meant for everybody.  Everyone isn't in there to fucking, you know,  be politically correct  and make everyone feel good.  Right.  There are certain areas that are like privileged areas.  I don't think it's...  The group actually met last year  to try to figure this shit out.  So maybe before the incident.  And Sharpton wants them fired.  See, now he's probably thinking of Richie Incognito.  But the reality is  that's going to affect black players.  Of course. 
[03:05:30]  Much more than white players.  If whoever now thinks that white players  are going to be getting tossed out of the NFL  for fucking saying that,  he's out of his fucking mind.  No, man.  I would love to see black players...  How about this?  I'm for it.  I am for the NFL  firing any player  for a first offense on saying that word.  Wow.  Let's see it happen.  Mm-hmm.  And you want...  Because white guys don't say that shit on the field.  You know that.  No.  Absolutely not.  So let knee-jerk, idiot reaction Sharpton 
[03:06:00]  and all these guys have their way.  And then you watch how many...  They don't care about felonies.  They don't care about if there's a video  of you possibly knocking your fucking girlfriend  unconscious in an elevator.  They don't give a fuck about that.  How about, um...  But Reverend Al...  Did you read this, Reverend Al, though?  No.  Don't read it.  What did he say?  Well, penalizing players for using the N-word  is a good first step, he writes.  It shows a recognition that there's a problem  in football specifically  and in sports in general.  What's the problem?  What is the problem?  If these guys have never, you know, 
[03:06:30]  have never come forward to discuss it,  they're totally cool with it.  They understand it's the atmosphere out there  when you're competing.  I think that the penalty should go further.  It ought to be immediate termination  with the player having the right to all due process.  If we don't take an unequivocal stand on the N-word,  what happens when openly gay athletes  are mocked with the F-word on the field  or players use anti-Semitic or anti-Irish words?  We must send a message  that all derogatory words are unacceptable  and will face maximum penalty. 
[03:07:00]  That's crazy.  Okay, so fire all players  and have a list of words you can't say.  You can't say baggy nigger,  you can't say Mick,  you can't say Dago.  You're not going to change human nature.  Everyone will just come up with the new words.  Right.  And then what?  Then we'll ban the new words, right?  I guess this is a problem for the NFL also  because this means they can't possibly hire people  for halftime shows at the Super Bowl  that have records where they use the N-word.  Have they or no?  Oh my God.  I don't think they've played those songs on stage 
[03:07:30]  but I would guarantee there has to be an artist  that they have hired that absolutely has a song  with that word in it.  Oh, I mean, McCartney.  Tom Petty.  Tom Petty.  That's true.  He's got a lot of them.  He's got to be.  Oh, fucking...  Let me think.  Didn't they have...  No, I mean Madonna, Bruno Mars, no?  Nicki Minaj?  Did they have Nicki Minaj or no?  Did she come out with Madonna or no?  Yeah, she came out with Madonna.  That was before the song anyway, though. 
[03:08:00]  But she had dropped that word.  What about M.I.A.?  Does she say I don't know what she does?  That's crazy.  Yeah, you know M.I.A.  No, no, but I don't know if she...  What she does...  Does she say that word?  I don't know.  That's what I'm asking.  She came out with Nicki Minaj, so...  That's crazy.  You know, among Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.,  there's some N-words being dropped.  Oh, hell yeah.  Let me go to Kevin in Houston, a ticket holder.  Kevin.  Hi, Kev.  What are you saying here?  It seems a little strange.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Yellow.  Kevon.  Yellow. 
[03:08:30]  Obviously, Mars is back, right?  Yellow.  First phone call of the day.  Of course, it's a bust.  Kevin.  There you go.  Just kidding, Mars.  Love you, Mr.  Who are you calling?  Hello?  I wasn't calling anyone.  Who's on that phone?  I'm waiting.  Just stood up for O&A to a serious rep.  Oh, boy.  What's this about?  Greg!  Hi.  I just want to say that I haven't subscribed for the last five months, so I have no idea, 
[03:09:00]  you know, what you guys have been up to.  But, yeah, some serious asshole tried to convince me to re-sign.  What's that?  No, go ahead, sir.  Mars is snooping around now.  Mars limped in.  Mars limped in.  I stayed for about a half hour, and I also pushed you guys real hard, and I probably got  nowhere with it, but, you know, I felt better, and I just wanted to call Justin.  Yeah, but at least the phone call is going somewhere.  What's that? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, nothing, sir.  So what happened?  You want to follow up the customer service reps?  Go ahead, sir.  Yeah, they tried to call and say, hey, we got a special, you know, this and that.  I said I wouldn't, you know, subscribe to Sirius, you know, for free.  By the way, Opie, I have enough money to buy 7,000 years' worth of subscription, so it  has nothing to do with whether I don't have money or whatever.  7,000 years?  It's a long time, sir.  I can't have my money going to Howie anymore.  Oh, no, now we're going to be in trouble. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, now we're in trouble.  I mean, fuck Howie.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  Is this Pat Cooper?  That old fossil.  Tim.  Pat Cooper sucked in some helium to get a couple more shots in.  You know what I told you?  You know what I've been saying?  I can't find the hang-up here.  Fuck.  Oh, no.  I've been saying that I would pay to hear you guys.  I wouldn't listen to Howie for free.  Oh, no.  That's my way to hang up the call.  This is trouble.  Oh, boy.  Oh, and hang up, Mars. 
[03:10:30]  Guys, I'm glad you're still there.  Oh, thanks, Greg.  Thank you.  All right, we'll see you later, buddy.  Thank you, sir.  I tried calling a couple of times so I could be on hold just so I could hear.  Like, ten minutes of you guys?  Uh-huh.  We would encourage people who like us to subscribe to SiriusXL.  Right.  Yeah, that keeps us here.  That would be good.  The money isn't going to you guys.  Not really, no.  You know who.  Right.  Who, who, who.  You don't have to buy 7,000 years.  Just, you know, one.  One.  One year would be great.  You're not old enough.  It's like 7,000 years would be silly. 
[03:11:00]  You'd never listen to all of you.  Yeah.  Hopefully 6,999 and a half of them would go to waste.  All right.  You want him to die.  Thank you, sir.  I'm very soon.  Thank you.  Let's say hi to Austin in Texas.  That's Greg along on Austin.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I just wanted to say it's pretty funny to hear Al Sharpton saying the guys should get  fired for using the N-word as an in-road to them possibly using faggot because I seem 
[03:11:30]  to remember a little appearance of his on the Morton Downey Jr. show back in the day where  he got an altercation with a gentleman if you want to find a clip in there.  I do believe he has used the word faggot and Greek homos.  Greek homos was a good one.  Whatever, you know.  So people could, like, grow from what they did in the past, but I don't think he's ever  really acknowledged or talked about this one.  Well, black people can.  White people aren't allowed to, as a matter of fact.  Right.  You can't.  If you're a racist, you're a racist forever if you're white. 
[03:12:00]  If you're black, obviously, oh, that was a long time ago.  Right.  Much like Jesse Jackson with Heine Town and Reverend Al with the Greek homos and whatnot.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Back to Al Sharpton.  What we're dealing with is an arrogance in sports, which the football field and the  locker room are treated differently than any other work site.  So?  So?  I don't give a fuck.  I'm all right with that.  I'm fine with it.  Not in a locker room or a fucking area on the field. 
[03:12:30]  I don't give a fuck.  Why would Reverend Al give a shit what goes on in the locker room?  This fucking guy's never worked out a day in his life.  Oh, no.  What does he know about a fucking locker room?  Exactly.  It's a bunch of big, delicious cocks and washboard abs.  High five, Sam.  And this fucking guy in his blueberry pies, you know, he realized he had a problem.  So instead of trying to do it the right way, he went and got his stomach stapled.  I bet you he didn't even try before he went with that surgery.  Speaking of Al Roker, I just saw him in the hallway.  Al!  Yeah?  He did not look happy to see me.  No, huh?  He looks weird. 
[03:13:00]  He does look weird.  Yeah.  Big, giant head, right?  Like a fucking weird shrunken head doll.  Oh, Bonnie.  What's he doing here?  That's racist.  Promoting his new show on the Weather Channel.  Oh, what's it called?  It's called The Weather.  I don't remember.  We'll see how this goes.  Yeah.  Close, but no cigar.  Zero accountability.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Batting 106.  Oh, that is an odd look he's got there.  At any worksite around the country, if you use any kind of discriminatory language, be 
[03:13:30]  it racial or gender-based, you could be fired.  Leave these fucking athletes alone.  It's a different fucking thing.  Yeah, they also think they better care for concussions and other fucking jobs, too.  And this fucking asshole, if he's going down this road, why don't you tackle music first?  Yeah, how about that?  Yeah, labels drop your fucking people for using that word.  What is he talking about?  We cannot act like NFL players because they generate so much money are above any other 
[03:14:00]  worker.  But they're not putting the word out there all over the place like rappers are.  Right.  They're not doing songs and putting pictures.  How about Nikki?  Imagine the Trouble of White Guy.  Nikki Minaj had that song.  She put a looking-ass nigga with Malcolm X's photo, which his fucking family complained  about.  Right.  And she apologized and took it down.  But then, no other penalty.  They should be subjected to the same worksite rules that anyone sitting in the stadium paying  to see them is subjected to. 
[03:14:30]  What?  What?  Why?  Just because they could sell tickets shouldn't mean they don't have to live by the rules.  Then go after music, you stupid fuck.  Yep.  Yeah.  Where do you think they're making their records?  Live by the rules that everybody else does.  If athletes can discipline their bodies and minds to do extraordinary feats, then they certainly  have the capacity to discipline their tongue to control their words.  Any excuses?  Unacceptable!  Ah! 
[03:15:00]  Shut up!  That's what I say.  All right.  See you later.  Oh, Jimmy, need a plug?  Oh, yes.  I have to.  This February...  That was a good out right there.  It was great.  That would have been a good out, right?  It would have been a lot of fun.  Shut up, and then boom.  Oh, I didn't see that coming.  Yeah.  He shut up!  But Jimmy got...  Oh, no, we got a better one.  I'll get you out, believe me.  Oh.  February 28th, this Friday, I'm in Pittsburgh doing one show at the Carnegie Music Hall, and  then March 6th through 8th, Ontario, California, at the Improv in Virginia Beach. 
[03:15:30]  The new dates are March 20th through 22nd, and my Boston date will be announced very soon.  Very soon.  Boston.  Yeah, I got a whole bunch of dates.  What am I out with a fucking bunch of girls?  No, you're not, Chip.  Wait a second.  I was going to go out on a laugh.  Oh, sorry.  When was that coming?  It was coming fucking soon.  The Opie and Anthony show is drawn to a close.  Stay tuned to reflect, relive, and get the story behind the story of the finest moments
