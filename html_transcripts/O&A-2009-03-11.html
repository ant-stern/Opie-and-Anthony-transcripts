<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a furious reaction to Howard Stern’s criticism of their move to Sirius XM. Opie and Anthony vehemently expressed their anger at Stern’s perceived unfair attacks, calling him out for labeling them as failures and questioning their salaries.  They detailed their unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue professionally with management, highlighting what they felt was a double standard favoring Stern.  Their frustration extended to other personalities like Bubba the Love Sponge, who also criticized them.  The discussion included several profane tangents, including complaints about their lack of privacy in their all-glass offices and humorous, often vulgar, anecdotes about their colleagues and listeners.  No guests were present in the studio during this segment.

The show then shifted to the surprising firing of their producer, "Stump Brain," who acted as a liaison between the show and their parent company.  They detailed the unusual working arrangement, highlighting the separation caused by bad blood between the managements, and their infrequent contact with management figures like Tom Chiasano.  The hosts launched into a humorous, and often crude, description of Stump Brain's personality and appearance, filled with vulgar jokes about his physique and clothing (satin running shorts).  They shared humorous tweets about the firing, including Opie's Rogaine joke, and described a picture of a man in revealing shorts that resembled their mental image of Stump Brain.

The final segment addressed the impending format change at their former radio station (92.3 FM) to a Top 40 format, boasting an initial 10,000 commercial-free songs.  Opie and Anthony expressed strong criticism, predicting its failure based on the experience of WAPP radio. They contrasted their personality-driven approach and innovative use of social media (Twitter, Facebook) with the predicted clumsy and ineffective social media strategy of the new format. They ridiculed the shallow content they anticipated and negatively commented on a news report announcing the change, criticizing the presenter's lack of enthusiasm. The segment concluded with the playing of Rage Against the Machine’s "Killing in the Name," reflecting their rebellious attitude towards these changes in the radio industry.

[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  This Heath Ledger, I mean, there was going to be no surprise there.  It was so obvious you weren't going to win.  And I was disappointed.  I thought we were going to see a corpse.  Too soon.  Too soon.  Did you quit smoking yet?  Did you quit smoking yet?  No, I didn't quit smoking yet.  Why don't you guys attack him like you attacked me?  Quit smoking.  We don't care if he does.  We don't care about you.  Why don't you shove it?  Shove it like your mother did.  Shove it like your mother did.  Shove it like your mother takes it.  Your mother, that whore, that whore. 
[00:04:30]  Think of your mom.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  You know what she does?  She's an effing whore.  She takes it in a dirty spot.  A dirty spot's a big gaping one.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wee, wee, wee.  People are like, are they still alive?  Of course we're still alive.  We're doing our satellite radio show.  Now we take over the satellite radio market. 
[00:05:00]  Some people are so confused.  So goddamn confused.  Like, I used to listen, but I have XM, but now I can only listen from 9 till 11.  Oh, really?  It's like, no.  You've had a few of those?  Yeah.  That's stupid.  No, we've always been on from 6 to 11.  Yeah.  You dummies.  Figure it out. 
[00:05:30]  It's too early to be calling our faithful listeners dummies.  Ah.  It's never too early to call them dummies.  Right.  CBS News sure didn't know what.  Where's my thing so I can do my thing?  The other, um...  Where's that?  Oh, that would be this one, I guess.  All right.  Ronnie B takes it over here.  Ronnie.  Wow.  What is this about?  Rob on Long Island.  How are you, Rob?  Hey there, Rob.  Hey, I'm doing good. 
[00:06:00]  You know, I've had XM since 03, so...  Thank you, sir.  I always just listen on XM, but the amount of love that CBS actually shows you guys.  You know, I was watching CBS News yesterday, and I know that they have to do a format flip  and you take care of their end and stuff, but since you guys had good ratings and everything  like that and, you know, weren't bringing the station down, they could at least throw  you guys a bone, and at the end of the segment, after they said that you guys were taken off  and blah, blah, blah, they could have said that you could still listen to Opie and Anthony 
[00:06:30]  on Sirius XM radio.  Yeah.  Wow.  You must be related to us.  Because that makes perfect sense, but that would never happen.  No way.  Ever, ever, ever, ever.  Yeah, I know.  Because they said that, and nobody's listening to CBS.  They don't, you know, move over to...  Well, because they're...  Now they're going for some kind of pop audience or whatever.  I mean, you know, now they have to compete against us, and they're still trying to get 
[00:07:00]  the same people we're talking to this morning, so of course they're not going to do anything  like that.  Never.  You know, I'm not surprised.  I just love the articles where they try to say that we sucked along with the radio station.  That's just not true.  Yeah.  But whatever.  You know, maybe we should have sent out a little something, but that would involve thinking  on our part.  Did somebody...  All right.  Did someone get a little rambunctious and start bashing us yesterday or something? 
[00:07:30]  Oh, Howard did.  I just want to know exactly what was said.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely, Howard.  Yeah?  Started bashing us.  I wonder if Greenstein yelled at him.  I said...  Like I got fucking crucified by him for saying two words months ago.  I sent a very...  An extremely...  Terse.  I sent a very professional email.  Terse, though?  Was it terse?  No, because you get nervous.  I hope it was terse.  My emails used to be terse, but you get a little nervous, so now I keep...  No, this is a reason for terse-ness. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, all right.  Well, I...  Well, are you okay that I cc'd Mel?  That's always a little...  I don't like the Mel cc's, but...  Well, Mel...  But Mel sat us down once.  He goes, look, before you guys get crazy on the radio, I'd appreciate it if you come  to me.  So I'm like, all right.  I'm just letting him know.  So I sent an email to Scott, Steve Blatter, who runs the channel, and a little, not even  a blind cc, a little cc to Mel, very professional, one paragraph, just asking the question, how 
[00:08:30]  does it help our radio show and the company having Howard bash us and calling us failures  on his radio show yesterday morning?  Very good.  Yes, that's exactly what I did.  Without any...  Good.  Without any of that...  Terseness?  Trust me.  I wanted to do a little terseness.  Trust me.  A little terse.  But as soon as we start going, really?  You want to talk about failing?  Then the company gets all crazy and mad at us.  Exactly.  Even though we're protecting our livelihood and ourselves. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  He had a little fun with the whole thing yesterday.  Yeah, that annoys me.  He goes, oh, they're not even on the radar.  They didn't even make the New York Post.  We made every other paper, you idiot.  But he was trying to say that the news of our firing wasn't even important enough to  make the papers.  It was on page two of the Daily News, you idiot.  But that guy just lies and does whatever the hell he wants to make himself look better  all the effing time.  Look out.  You're going to get yelled at.  Whatever.  That disgusted me that time we were in the office. 
[00:09:30]  I'm yelling at Scott.  I'm yelling at him about this very situation.  Right.  This exact situation.  And I was being yelled at because Howard was talking ill of us.  Well, what happens is we've, I mean, people can be in shock about this, but it is the  truth.  We've left him alone for a long time.  And then what happens is he takes his little cute little shots at us because we so get  under his skin to this day, which is hilarious to me, by the way. 
[00:10:00]  And then when he does take his little shots, then we beat him up.  Right.  Because we're the best dad in the business.  Everyone knows it.  Yeah, I know.  He even knows it.  Like you take little shots at us.  Guess what?  We don't take little shots back.  We go for the jugular.  And then because we go for the jugular and protect ourselves, we get in trouble.  We could say stuff like talk about being off the radar, you know, but I wouldn't say  anything like that.  No.  But we could.  If I wanted to, I could say that.  And, you know, we could write our own history because he likes to say that we failed. 
[00:10:30]  And I would argue that we certainly did not fail.  Great ratings.  And I could prove that point pretty easily.  But I could make my own news and show how maybe he was a failure in his career in the  end.  In the end.  But if I said that, you know.  You get in trouble.  You're going to be called on the carpet and yelled at.  Yeah.  And then we would go, all right, let us play the audio.  So let the listeners decide what the fuck he was doing.  We're not allowed to do that anymore.  We're not allowed to play his audio.  That's dangerous.  Yeah.  We'd love to.  I don't give a crap if people play our audio. 
[00:11:00]  I don't care.  Yeah, play it.  That's what people allow if they don't really care in the end.  When are we going to do transcripts?  Get the audio.  Yeah, we could get David.  We could get into David to play Howard.  And we could get some other dummy to play that laughing.  That'd fit.  That laughing hole that when I see her in the gym, it couldn't be nicer to me.  But it has no problem jumping on because she's scared that Howard might, you know, kick  her out the door if she doesn't play her role.  Yeah.  But boy, Robin, when I see you in the gym, are you the nicest little thing to me?  Bunch of phonies. 
[00:11:30]  True.  Bunch of phonies.  Yeah, I heard about that whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  That went down.  My Twitter, my emails, my fuck the social networking.  My actual cell phone was ring-a-ding-a-ding-ing all day long about that.  I heard about that.  I'm just like, wow, don't you guys work for the same company?  Wouldn't it be good that he, you know, he doesn't have to welcome you guys, but wouldn't  it be good if he just kept his mouth shut?  It's good for him.  It's good for you guys.  It's good for the company.  I'm like, well, you would think that. 
[00:12:00]  You know what it is?  The ego is such, he's got such a huge ego that he has to comment on us because of the fact  that he's been off the radar for years.  He's been off the radar.  Talk about somebody that used to be in the paper every day on Terrestrial and then just  disappeared off the face of the earth.  Uh-oh, what did I say?  Am I going to be dragged in and yelled at? 
[00:12:30]  For taking a little shot at the Golden Boy?  I'm so sick of the double standard that goes on in this company.  Just, just, and now I'll hear, how does this help?  Well, how did that help?  How did that help that he called us failures?  You tell me.  How did it help that he announced what he thinks is our salary and said, oh, it's not, I can't  believe they're being paid that much.  That's not worth it.  I'm like, wow, you want to talk about worth?  Yeah, exactly.  You want to like take our salaries and then do a little division with the listeners we 
[00:13:00]  got for that salary and really get into this?  Yeah, exactly.  Wouldn't need companies coming over to fucking take money out of their wallet to keep the  payroll going.  I'm glad you brought it up because I've been biting my lip all night.  Ah, I'm disgusted.  And this is what scares me about losing regular radio.  Like Jimmy was saying yesterday, it's fun to be on satellite.  It's good.  Creatively, it's a wonderful thing.  You get to pretty much do and say whatever you want. 
[00:13:30]  But when I walk around in my little life and people want to talk radio, they don't mention  him at all anymore.  No.  And that's what scares me.  Like, are we going to go off the radar?  Yeah.  That's the question.  I don't want that to happen.  We're going to work our asses off on our end to make sure that doesn't happen.  I heard the call center down at XM yesterday was ridiculous.  People couldn't get on the line because they were signing up a whole bunch of new people  that were listening to us on regular radio. 
[00:14:00]  So that's a good sign.  But it scares the fucking shit out of me.  Man.  What the company should have done was put out a full page ad in the New York papers today.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we did have a following.  We had a very good rating, men 18 to 49.  And there, open up the page, huge ad.  Guess what?  Good news, New Yorkers.  You can still hear Opie and Anthony.  This is how you do it.  That's smart business.  Yeah.  And smart marketing.  But is it in the paper today?  No.  No.  Is it going to be in the paper tomorrow? 
[00:14:30]  No.  No.  No.  And that's why I sit here really frustrated and really pissed because I'm like scared  that we're going to fall off the radar.  There it is.  That's the headline.  And let me tell you something.  Guaranteed we catch shit about this little segment that we're doing right now.  Well, Thomas, shut the fuck up.  We haven't talked about him in months.  You remember the meeting we had last time?  Oh, yeah.  Holy mother of fuck.  I had a vein popping out of my head.  We were amazed.  As I was face-to-face screaming with management.  We were amazed because he took his little shot. 
[00:15:00]  Then we, you know, fired back strong.  And we get in trouble for protecting ourselves.  It's like, no, we got in trouble like we brought it up in the first place.  I think your analogy was, wait, wait, how did you say it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Something about it.  Howard punched us.  Yeah.  If somebody comes up to you and punches you in the face and you punch him back in the face  and break his nose.  And you get in trouble for punching him in the face.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, well, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Completely unprovoked. 
[00:15:30]  It's just the double standard.  Well, they're not braiding.  But they don't say that, though.  They try to go, well, you know, no, it's not that at all.  It's just that.  The BS jockeying for position that the suits do over there just is disgusting.  Just tell us we're in a double standard world.  Yeah, be honest.  And then I guess we have to just suck it up.  We'll have to deal with it.  And take it up our assholes.  But don't even sit there and try to tell us that it's a fair play.  Right.  That, you know, hey, well, when he does that, we have a little chat with him, too. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  God, Paul, it's such a bunch of crap.  And then an old fatso decided to jump in.  And, of course, I'm sure he'd, you know, what?  Old fatso, old Bubba the Loves one.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  Talk about radar.  He piled on.  I wonder how many people he took out when he piled on.  That fat slob.  Can't keep himself away from the fucking buffet. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because no one's ever.  Some people choose to be fat.  Guess what?  He's not one of those guys that chooses to be fat.  He's one of those guys that can't help himself.  Not for him.  That redneck hillbilly who thinks he's in the same genre as us.  Shut up.  Did anyone even listen to hear it?  Huh?  No.  I just got spies all over the fucking place.  I got spies.  I got lawyers.  I got detectives.  I say that because there's a few people out there that think they're being cute. 
[00:17:00]  Trust me.  You're not.  You're done to.  Enough.  Enough of these phonies.  God, I'm disgusted with the phoniness.  Dude, I belong to the same gym as Robin.  She couldn't be nicer.  Comes up to me every time.  Hey, we're on the same team.  You guys sound great.  Blah, blah, blah.  I'm hearing great things about you and your show.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then how?  And Robin's like, oh, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Do you have a brain of your own?  I see the real Robin.  And that's not you on the radio, you chicken shit.  Yeah.  So if it's going to be like this, then don't fucking come up to me in the gym and be all nice and sweet.  Yeah.  Avoid eye contact and be all uncomfortable.  That's not how I play.  I'm pretty much the same.  I'm on air, off air.  Maybe, you know, some of the personality flaws are exaggerated, but for the most part.  No, no, you're the same. 
[00:18:00]  Couldn't be nicer.  I can't even tell you.  Couldn't be nicer, but.  And you know what?  At this point right now, it isn't.  And I'm being honest.  It isn't even a stupid Howie going off at the mouth.  You know, it's not even that.  Fine.  He wants to come up with some subject to fill some time on his show.  Right.  And it happens to be us. 
[00:18:30]  He wants to spin our shit.  We just want to be able to respond.  Whatever.  I want to be able to respond.  And I don't want.  And the way we know how to respond.  The bullshit that comes out of the mouth of certain management over there that tries  to tell me that we're wrong for responding when we just got shit on.  And then we're not supposed to, like, respond to it.  Right.  And I tell them.  I say, well, do you honestly think our listeners, we can have any credibility with our listeners 
[00:19:00]  if we don't address it?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you don't.  And then they try to tell us about our listeners and how they are with the show.  After years of doing the show, they're going to tell us how we're supposed to talk to  our listeners and stuff.  Just shut up.  Just stop it.  And I don't think there's a show or a radio guy in management, the people that own the  companies, that truly understand how interactive we've been with our listeners since the beginning. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, day one.  So don't tell us, oh, that doesn't really matter with your listeners, blah, blah, blah.  No, no.  You don't understand.  See, the listener.  We're actually accessible.  We have a cult.  Right.  I was at FH hanging out, and people come up to me like, you don't have Kenny with you?  I can't believe you're here just hanging out without bodyguards and stuff.  Bodyguards.  I'm like, that's not our thing.  We get out there and hang with the people. 
[00:20:00]  I figured I was going moron-less tonight.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  That's not our thing.  Never has, really.  I mean, we need them at times, because you guys tend to be animals, but we're not rolling  around town in limos and being completely separated from our listeners.  Very accessible.  We'll sign for a long time after every show.  We stand there and sign.  Dude, we take pictures and autographs every day.  We have a live audience every day that we just allow up.  No one does that.  So we've got to deal with that, and guaranteed, like I said, guaranteed, and believe me, I'll 
[00:20:30]  let you in on it tomorrow.  I guarantee we just catch shit for this.  Oh, well.  Someone's going to make it, but they're all panicky, making phone calls.  What did he say?  Well, why we couldn't listen to the thing first, and then do nothing?  Right.  Because that's what happens.  We should have Fat E-Rock there transcribe a couple of the fun little things and have David  play Howard.  I told, uh, oh my God, who wants to play, I told him, the last time we got bitched 
[00:21:00]  out for this, last time we got bitch smacked for this.  I don't know why you're not appreciating my little bit there.  Oh, I am.  I'm just very angry this morning.  It's kind of a good one, man.  I'm angry this morning.  I think I got the, you can do it yourself on the phone if you like.  So, the last time we got bitched out for this, I came out with, hey, okay, is he going 
[00:21:30]  to get the same discussion that we just got?  Right.  And then I heard this, I actually heard this out of, uh, one of the suit's mouths.  Someone will talk to him.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  And did you talk to him?  And what happened?  And now what are the repercussions going to be that he, uh, opened his yap again and bashed  us for the greater good of the company?  What, what is that about?  Yeah, because they shoved that in their face many times. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, did they fucking stick it right down our crawl?  That's why I wrote the professional email yesterday with a nice CC to the big guy.  I'm like, look, how does that, because that's what, that's what people would ask us.  Not like, you're idiots, blah, blah, blah.  They would like, do it that way.  Well, how does this help?  How does this help?  How does this help our company?  I'm still waiting for a good answer on how that helped us.  Knowing that so many people, you know, have, have the satellite already and all of a sudden  we're in the news. 
[00:22:30]  We're going to be in the news and hot for a mere two days.  That's how it works.  And then, then, then it go, they go on to the next story.  But yesterday was, Opie and Anthony, very hot on everyone's radar.  And you got, uh, Howard talking about us in a bad way.  Who in their right mind is going to go, you know what?  I got the satellite.  Maybe I'll check them out a little bit.  Yeah.  Which would lead to them maybe becoming fans, which would lead to maybe them telling their  friends about us.  Yeah.  That's how it works in the business world.  But to have your, your quote, and I say quote, trust me. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  I don't give a shit.  Quote, your big star, you know, uh, trashing us on the day that we're on everyone's radar.  Really?  How does that help?  Yeah.  How does that help the company?  Why don't you go to him and ask him, sit him down in a little meeting and yell in his face,  yell in his face.  So your spit hits his fucking face like I remember and, and tell him, uh, how that helps the company.  You're never going to do that.  Bunch of scared shitless suits just over there kissing his fucking ass, uh, to the, to the 
[00:23:30]  trashing of everyone else.  Good.  Good.  That worked really good for the company.  Apparently your strategies are working very well.  I think some suits need their heads rolling over there.  Please.  Enough.  Christ.  I think I'm going to buy 18 billion shares today.  I got some change in my pocket.  Jesus.  Well, fuck them, man.  Greater good of the company.  We sat down. 
[00:24:00]  We were good soldiers being good boys.  And what?  Yeah, that really did well.  So why don't you let us fucking do radio the way we know how to do it without your,  your bullshit interference?  Let us fucking do radio.  We know our listeners.  We know how to do fucking radio.  So stop count beans, count your fucking beans.  I can't wait to get yelled at for this.  I can't wait.  People are going to be confused.  I think the headline really is simple.  You know, he can say whatever the fuck he wants, but let us defend ourselves. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, exactly.  That's it.  That's radio.  Because what happens is we'll defend ourselves like we did.  And now we'll definitely be in trouble for this.  Definitely.  It's not even, it's not even a question.  Not even a question.  And we wouldn't have said shit.  Not a peep.  We wouldn't have said shit.  Good soldiers like we've been over, over the years.  Good fucking soldiers that we've been.  And the only time we ever open our mouth is when we get shit on.  Oh, you know, we used to take our shots, uh, unprovoked, uh, sure, many years ago. 
[00:25:00]  But for a really, really long time, we haven't said shit until he says something first.  And the bottom line is, yeah.  That is a fact that they can look up themselves.  The bottom line is, like Opie said, how is this good for the company with him trashing  us on the day that we were in the paper and on the radar?  How does that help the company?  I mean, we were, I mean, we had major exposure yesterday.  Even if he just kept his mouth shut, it would have been better.  Uh, you know, could he have said something like, hey, look who's exclusive now to satellite 
[00:25:30]  radio?  Uh, boy, if you were listening, you could sign up now.  Things like, I would never expect that.  Believe me, that's in a, that's in a fucking LSD hallucination.  Well, that delusional, that delusional idiot's going to spin that now.  I don't, I don't need him kissing our ass.  I don't need him going, oh, look how great this is.  But I certainly, you know, don't appreciate being trashed.  Would never happen.  Well, the financial interest is also, this show, if you listen, Stern's fans hear that 
[00:26:00]  they can get this show on a pay package.  So it's also a financial interest to not shit on the show because then people set up for  money.  It's good for the company.  It's good for the company.  And then when we do it.  There's still a lot of people that have Sirius, they don't have the best of XM.  So that's what I'm getting at all of a sudden.  But why would they get it if Howard's calling us failures?  Why would they get it?  Really?  I wouldn't.  Boy, Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  Yeah.  If that's all I knew and the big quote star is telling me, you know, they're failures, 
[00:26:30]  I'm not fucking going and checking them out.  How will the suits spin this one so they could fucking once again just yell in our faces for  us just responding to an unprovoked attack?  Maybe he's smart.  He figured out he would get his name in the news by jumping on our little exposure we got  yesterday.  Good luck.  The only thing that gets in the news these days is when your wife does something for  animals.  It's the only fucking time I ever hear your name.  And the wife of Howard Stern was at the North Shore Animal League. 
[00:27:00]  And the wife of Howard Stern was seen at a polo game.  And the wife of Howard Stern.  That's the only time you're in the fucking news.  When was one thing you did on the air that actually hit the fucking newspaper?  So stop about under the radar.  Enough.  And Bubba talking about radar.  Stop it.  The United States military thinks it's a meteor hitting the planet.  That's how he's on the radar.  I think he was the cause of that noise in Jersey the other day.  Yeah.  What was that? 
[00:27:30]  They said another meteor.  Another meteor?  Somewhere in Jersey and they're looking for pieces.  Was he jumping up and down?  I won't.  I won't.  I won't.  Stupid Bubba.  That dumb redneck hillbilly.  Hillbilly.  God.  Just saddled with him now.  What an idiot.  Saddled.  Oh.  God damn.  I ran into Scott Farrell over there.  And I wrote a little something about it.  And we sort of made up.  And he was really cool and stuff about everything. 
[00:28:00]  And apologized and said he's always loved us and this and that.  Whatever.  We had a long discussion.  He goes, ah, I gotta tell you, that Bubba really wants to punch you in the face.  I'm like, stop.  Does he?  Does he really?  With the real violence shit.  Wow.  I'm scared of Bubba the love sponge.  God.  You might want to smell my fist before you decide to punch me in the face, fatso.  They smell like shit.  Let me just go off on a little tangent. 
[00:28:30]  We'll get back to that.  I'm boxing my ass off these days in the gym.  But I don't have my own gloves right now.  So I'm putting on the gym gloves.  That's what happens.  You'll fucking have to get your own gloves.  That's why I want to bring this up.  I have washed these hands.  I know I'll never get to smell my hands.  Oh, never.  I have.  It must be under my fingernails.  I've scrubbed three or four times.  And they still smell horrendous.  You know what that is?  It's bacteria now that's in your skin.  They have the gloves all on a rack, and you pick out your size, and you start punching 
[00:29:00]  stuff, which is very healthy when you're very frustrated.  That's what I did when I was in Models.  So I fucking picked out gloves on a rack, and I took them for myself.  I would never wear someone else.  Dude, get Purell.  Yeah.  People grab their balls.  Oh, my God.  Fucking touch the gloves.  Wiping and missing, and then put their hand on the glove, and there's shit in the glove.  A little speckle.  They puke.  They jerk off in there.  I love punching, but they smell horrendous. 
[00:29:30]  And you got to put something on your fucking wrist, or are you going to break your wrist?  Oh, yeah.  I got to spray your wrist.  You got to put something on your wrist.  I kind of was-  Are you going to wrap it?  I don't wrap it, but there's a glove you can get.  You're supposed to get a glove, but you know what?  I'm an idiot, and I had a little anger issue yesterday, so I might have sprayed my wrist.  Oh, but do what I do.  I don't even use gloves.  I slap the bag, and I yell, get off me.  Stop it, you.  So if that fat hillbilly wants to punch me, maybe give me a few days for my wrist to  heal, and then we'll see what happens.  I would just-  You loser.  I would just do that.  Piling on.  Wow, that's real brave, Bubba.  Piling on, are you? 
[00:30:00]  I would just do that backwards jog, and look at him as he's trying to run at me and laugh  at him.  That would be-  Like, you know what?  There's nothing more embarrassing and degrading watching a fat man try to chase you, especially  when you can turn around backwards and run faster than him, and then you just  look and go, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  And then in his fake radio voice, hey, you got back, he's like a buggy, you know, run,  run, run, run, run, run, get back.  Ah, shove it. 
[00:30:30]  And you pinch his nose like Mr. Miyagi in Karate Kid 2?  Yeah.  When he's on his knees, tired, you hold his nose and just jerk off in his face.  That's my suggestion.  Well, I'm glad you brought it up, because I'm always the one that's the idiot for bringing  shit up.  No, that just annoyed the piss out of me.  And because of, if we didn't go through what we went through last time, I just would have left it alone.  Right.  But to be bitched at, to be treated like a little fucking bitch in someone's office because of what happened last time, and then to have this happen. 
[00:31:00]  And I know, and don't even fucking lie to me and say he got a talking to.  No one talks to him about that shit.  You're lying if you say he got a talking to.  I want to know.  What was the talking to?  What was said?  Did it stop?  Is there going to be some kind of a retraction or apology?  Yeah, sure.  Just stop it already.  Just let, let us do radio and you sit there and count the fucking ever diminishing beans. 
[00:31:30]  He could have kept his mouth shut, certainly, but he decided to spin it to make himself look great and we look like idiots.  But the fact remains, you know, some of the things he said yesterday, all the lies is like, look, it was such a who gives a shit story.  They weren't even in the paper.  We were in page two, page two of the daily news.  We almost made the front page with this horrendous firing that went down yesterday or two days ago, whatever the fuck now.  And then it was all over the news.  Yeah.  All over the news.  The ratings were very good considering the climate of regular radio. 
[00:32:00]  He understands this.  I would run circles around him if I debated him about radio and what is going on out there.  Everyone knows.  Sorry.  Sorry we didn't make the news about our wife doing an exercise machine infomercial.  Christ.  Everyone knows.  Plus the fact that our regular radio show had to compete with the Opie and Anthony version of that show.  You know what that's all about, Howard.  I mean, the fact is, when we got suspended for 30 days, we had a ridiculous, ridiculous ratings period for regular radio. 
[00:32:30]  Because guess what?  All those people said, fuck, I still want to listen to these guys.  Oh, wait, they're on regular radio in my town.  Boom.  They went over there.  And if that idiot hasn't been in radio long enough to understand what happens when the format changes, we were on that station for three hours out of 24 hours of programming.  Three hours of the 24 hours was the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:33:00]  And we were kicking ass.  For three years, too, by the way.  For three years.  Yeah, we were on that for three years.  Because conveniently, he tries to lump us into that loser of a radio guy.  I still like his music, David Lee Roth.  Like, David Lee Roth and then those guys.  No, it wasn't that easy.  David Lee Roth literally lasted, what, three weeks?  We lasted three years.  And we left with very good ratings.  Sorry we couldn't carry the other 21 hours of the radio station that failed miserably and had to be replaced with a pop format that obviously we don't fit in as a morning show. 
[00:33:30]  And they said we did our jobs.  Yeah.  Anyone who heard our regular radio show, holy shit, they were selling the fuck out of it.  But it wasn't good enough to keep the whole station afloat.  We were doing live reads every two fucking minutes for them.  You couldn't, yeah.  You can't carry the entire fucking station. 
[00:34:00]  Ugh.  Stop it.  Just stop with the lies.  Sick of it.  And the suits defending it like the fucking, ugh.  The golden idol.  Ugh, don't say anything bad.  We'll have a talking to with him.  Pull him into the glass fucking offices, you paranoid bunch of asses.  Can we have a fucking wall in that place?  Where you could hide and fucking scratch your ass without everyone seeing? 
[00:34:30]  Holy mother of fuck do I not want to go over there.  Why was that really funny, man?  You could, why look from one end of a skyscraper to the other through all the glass walls?  Yeah, you sort of got to explain it, because we are talking to a lot of people that work  in cubicles and offices and stuff.  Sirius is set up, they're all glass walls, and like...  It's like the Fortress of Solitude with Superman.  Right.  Everything's made of crystals.  Right.  So when, like, the last time we went over there, we were getting yelled at because Howard took 
[00:35:00]  his shot, and then we took shots that weren't part of the rules, I guess.  Yeah, the backwards fucking rules.  And as there's a massive yelling match going on, it's a glass office, and everybody's  walking by, including that fucking secret agent double spy, Baba Booey, another one that  is so nice to us to our face, but then runs back to Howard to lap his ass.  Oh, he made sure he walked by the office a couple times to see us getting a talking tour. 
[00:35:30]  During the screaming.  During the fucking screaming.  I think there was a fucking tour going through.  Right.  And here's Opie and Anthony being yelled at.  They don't fucking put up a wall.  Sheet rock.  You ever hear of it?  Paint spackle.  So it really is glass offices so everyone can see all the shit going down.  Bunch of morons plowing into the walls like birds.  Maybe it's a brilliant business, what am I trying to say? 
[00:36:00]  It might be a brilliant way to keep your workers in check.  It certainly is.  You know, if you see someone getting their ass reamed out, and you're Joe Worker walking  by, I think you're going to give it a little extra that day.  You're going to be careful.  Because first of all, they can watch you right through your fucking walls.  Most of you fuckers, you know, you can take an hour and a half lunch because you're in  an office and no one can see what you're doing in there.  They all wanted x-ray vision.  They didn't have it, so they just went with the glass walls. 
[00:36:30]  That's serious.  Just to be on the safe side, they take 55-minute lunch breaks because you never know when someone's  going to be walking by your glass office.  By your glass office.  Enough with the glass office.  I hate the glass office.  Do us a favor.  Next time you're going to yell at us, maybe we do it in a closet.  Can we put some newspapers up on the window so the whole world doesn't see?  The closet's in glass.  You see coats hanging up.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like that divisible man fucking model. 
[00:37:00]  They used to be able to see all the guts inside the guy.  That's what it is.  And, you know, Howard has spun his success over the years.  Trust me.  I mean, if he really wants to debate, I have no problem.  I can talk about all the cities he actually failed in.  Yeah.  We failed in cities, too.  But as a radio guy, guess what?  You talk about where you're doing well.  Yeah.  But there's a long laundry list of places he never hit.  So if he really wants to start talking about this failing thing, please, you will lose  again.  You know that. 
[00:37:30]  You know that.  I know that.  We get under your skin.  We know that.  It's okay.  And he was talking about pay?  Look, you need to compliments all the time.  You had a really good career.  We all know that.  We're not stupid.  Don't worry, baby.  You had a good career.  Don't worry.  They're there.  And no one's going to forget about you anytime soon.  No.  As long as your wife is in the newspaper and it says, husband is Howard Stern, you'll  still be in the news.  What are you in the news for now?  Some outrageous interview?  What did you do?  A wacky stunt that got all over the news? 
[00:38:00]  What did you do?  Have a guest on that no one else has on?  Expose something?  Oh, no.  That's right.  You're building a huge house in the Hamptons and people are pissed.  That's how you make news now.  You make news now by doing things that you used to laugh at people for doing.  Remember?  Do you remember those days?  But don't worry.  You had a really good career.  You did.  We all know that.  It's okay, Boobie.  It's okay.  I have no problem admitting that.  On the one lousy CD we did put out, I actually thanked you. 
[00:38:30]  He did okay.  Sure.  I thanked you and then I gave you a little shot, but I did thank you.  What I said was, thanks to Howard Stern for paving the way, but then again, didn't he invent  Asphalt.  Asphalt or Taurus.  But that's how I do it.  What can I tell you?  All right.  Well, I guess this is okay, what we did today, because no one really officially got back to  me yesterday about this.  No one's awake. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Why didn't anyone get back to you yesterday or right after his break, we should have gotten  a call saying, hey, by the way, Howard said this and that, and here's how we think your  reaction should be, even though they don't know from a hole in the wall.  You would think there would be some kind of communication as far as that goes, especially  after that last episode, but again, nothing, because they don't look at what he did as doing  anything wrong for the company, but now we're going to get the old, how does it work for 
[00:39:30]  the company?  Stop it.  It works one way, apparently.  Well, we got, well, people decided to actually, you know, call us this morning.  Thank you.  I think yesterday everybody was in shock.  Every line is lit.  People are talking that there was like a 45 to an hour.  Wait.  Wait.  Thank you.  To talk to someone at XM or Sirius yesterday. 
[00:40:00]  I would like to think that's because of our popularity, but they're down to one operator.  No computer, just a pen for information.  A pen.  In a glass office somewhere.  A pen that the person had to bring in themselves.  Dude, that glass office thing is going to make me laugh all day.  I hate the glass office.  All right.  You can see everyone's business.  Everyone.  It's the future.  No, it's fucking intrusive.  It's invasive.  It's fucking, there's no privacy.  How about at least a shade? 
[00:40:30]  All right.  Before I yell at you, I'm going to put the shade down to, so you have, so you have some  dignity after I'm done ripping your asshole apart.  You know what it is?  They, they want this whole atmosphere of like openness, man, and idea sharing.  It's like, if we see like Bob is in this studio, in his office, and he's working on something,  I could peek in and go, hey, maybe I could help out.  Right.  No.  It's to look in and see if someone's fucking twiddling their thumbs.  Right.  I hate the glass office. 
[00:41:00]  It's like working at an ant farm.  We're at an ant farm.  That's true.  It's an ant farm.  Are you fucking picking up your larvae today and putting it in the baby chamber?  I've never seen more paranoid workers in my life.  They're constantly looking up, seeing if anyone's peeking in into their glass office.  There's a cricket on the roof.  Why haven't you dragged it down into the office?  There's a man walking by with a praying mantis leg on his back.  They keep their lunch in their file cabinet. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Sneak a bite really fast when no one's walking by the glass office.  Right.  Wow.  What have we got here?  A jelly donut.  The glass office stinks.  Oh, I hate it.  Oh, wow.  It is impossible.  It's the worst thing when you're walking by and just seeing fearful people shaking at their desk. 
[00:42:00]  There's not a moment you can fuck off.  No.  Not one moment.  The boss walks by.  I see what you're doing.  I know you do.  Dude, I can't even express to you, like, the day we were getting just ripped apart by this guy.  I'm not even going to say his name.  Everybody was walking by and taking a peek.  And then everyone's like, because that's what offices do.  They shatter.  Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.  And then Howard, of course, Baba Booey, get down there. 
[00:42:30]  Report back to me.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.  Look, someone's being yelled at.  I think it's Toby and Anthony.  Buzz, buzz, buzz.  That's not part of what they say over there.  Believe me, this show is known as the scumbags.  Yes, the fucking bastard stepchildren of the company we took over.  The scumbags are getting yelled at again.  And by the way, to Baba Booey, you're the worst secret agent ever.  You don't think I know what you're all about when you're incredibly nice to our face,  trying to pick up any little tidbit that you can bring back to your master? 
[00:43:00]  Shut up.  Go away.  Enough of the phoniness.  Howard could have spun a nice yesterday for himself.  Look, it's a good spot to be in.  CBS is in shambles.  Yes.  Is it because Howard laughed?  Partly.  Yes.  Is it because the whole radio business has changed drastically in the last four years?  Yes.  That's a huge part as well.  Yeah.  And you could have a little fun with the fact that, yeah, it's finally that, you know, 
[00:43:30]  I'll tell you, us leaving regular radio is officially the death of regular radio.  Yeah.  And we're not that cocky too often.  And our regular listeners know that.  But this is a, that was a biggie.  That is the death of regular radio.  Yeah.  Officially.  We were hoping we'd be the last ones out.  We were pretty much the last ones out.  Yeah.  We're not talking Rush Limbaugh and the political talk and all that.  We're talking about the type of radio we were doing.  Yeah.  Now it's going to be a million radio stations out there playing just music. 
[00:44:00]  Just music.  Very safe stuff you can get on your fucking iPod.  Some either voice tracked guy that goes 15 minutes in a studio announcing the beginnings  and ends of songs on the list.  Right.  He's not really there.  Or some low paid schlub that's got to sit there and read liners for the station.  Right.  To keep it local.  Right.  What they mean is keep it very cheap.  Right.  They get what they pay for too.  They get a cheap guy in there that yucks it up when he talks about where the station 
[00:44:30]  is going to be doing some beer fucking fest.  Right.  And that's it.  It's a sad day for regular radio.  It really is.  I mean we got a home for now.  We'll see what happens after this first 45 minutes.  But.  Yeah.  I just couldn't hold it in anymore.  But believe me we didn't do anything that warrants them giving you a little retaliatory  strike on this program.  I defy you.  Play the fuck.  Sit me down in your fucking stupid fish tank office. 
[00:45:00]  You want me to feed the fish while I'm in there?  I'll sit by the diver with the bubbles coming out of his helmet and play the entire 45 minutes  we just did and tell me one thing that you can yell at me about.  Give me one fucking thing that you could justifiably bitch at me about.  Pick it out.  I'll give you time.  You've got plenty of time.  Take the 45 minutes.  Edit down just the classic moments of things I can be yelled at for.  I defy you to find one.  Well I was taking notes. 
[00:45:30]  Really?  618 was a little.  Was a little iffy?  Yes.  Oh Christ.  622.  That's good.  Oh boy.  I'm going to be called into the terrarium for that one.  Sit under the fake plastic palm tree and sun myself.  The boss is running in a habit trail like Gordon Gekko yelling at you.  Yeah put him on the wheel.  That's what they do.  Just set it up like a big habit trail.  Oh stupid glass office. 
[00:46:00]  There's no reason for glass offices.  It sucks.  Jesus.  Well.  Someone on the phone said it's supposed to spring out creativity.  It doesn't.  It brings out paranoia.  People hang posters on the window just so they can be left alone.  Trying to like yeah so they can jockey themselves behind a poster and not be seen for a second.  Well that's all well and good or is it good and well?  Well and good.  Well yeah.  That's all well and good but when the secretary is in a glass box.  Oh stop.  What is that dummy creating? 
[00:46:30]  Brubaker had more privacy in the hole.  I made an appointment so you could get your cuticles done sir.  Well thank you.  I hate the glass.  Cuticle.  Oh cuticle.  I hate it.  There's no reason for a glass office.  How are you supposed to sneak in there and get a little Japanese shit porn just to mind  your own business?  Yeah that's another thing.  Creativity.  Now it keeps people off the fucking internet looking at porno.  M&M's studio is cool though because I'll say that they have big curtains on there. 
[00:47:00]  He's just.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's stupid.  He probably walked in and said fuck this.  Put curtains up.  Big drapes.  You think we could get curtains on our studio?  There.  Our studio?  Well our closet.  Our little closet because you know the quote star has half the building?  Half the building.  We'll get one blind out of the studio.  One blind a year.  The quote star.  By 2075 this thing will be in darkness.  Yeah that was justified giving them half the building as everyone else squeezes into the 
[00:47:30]  remaining space in glass offices.  Is there any way that wall could be knocked down so we could take over that little closet  also in the studio and they go I don't think we have enough glass for that.  We're plumb out of glass.  The studio we're moving into is maybe a third of the size of where we're broadcasting now  and you got to explain some of the stuff.  There is a wall that would give us an extra no joke like well picture your basic closet. 
[00:48:00]  Maybe a small walk-in closet.  Small walk-in.  So we're like all right if we take this wall down that will help.  Yeah.  A little more room.  Oh come on we got we got to talk to the building.  Really.  Then tear down that bitch of a bearing wall and put a picture window where it belongs.  Oh by the way we couldn't even get that done because we're lame losers.  We can't get shit done.  A little wall we couldn't even get done.  By the way the quote star he doesn't have any glass fucking walls. 
[00:48:30]  No I'm sure.  He knows that.  Yeah.  What happened to creativity boys and girls?  Things I've seen.  I mean it's a fucking bank vault.  I've been in there.  On that side of the building.  Oh was I supposed to say that?  Don't want to get Tim Sabian in trouble for giving me the tour.  Uh oh.  He was so paranoid as he showed me around.  Oh and this is where they do this and that.  Oh my god please don't.  Don't say that.  Oh my god.  Humna humna humna.  If you even say that you weren't here all hell will break loose. 
[00:49:00]  I sat in your chair.  No pictures.  I checked it out.  Did you fart in it?  Yeah.  It's a good spot man.  It's great.  It's great space.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Of course it is.  It's amazing.  You're not talking about our space.  No our space sucks.  I haven't seen it yet.  But they're like it'll be okay guys.  We just got to get you over here and then you know.  Can we grind our office walls down prescription so I can see better?  I just want to do that.  Like prescription walls in my office. 
[00:49:30]  As people are walking the heads are like 40 feet big.  That would be great.  We see them perfectly clearly.  A big magnifying glass.  There's dead ants all over the floor.  The sun is burning people.  That's stupid.  Wow.  A lot of phone calls.  Lots of phone calls.  Yeah.  Maybe we shouldn't go to the phones.  Because then they're going to pile on and we're going to be in trouble.  They're the ones that get us in trouble. 
[00:50:00]  No.  We spoke our fucking piece.  And I would hate to have those.  I'd hate to have the listeners dragged into those glass offices.  Oh boy.  Now listen to me.  If you're going to be a listener of the O.P.  Anthony show.  What are we doing with just listeners?  What are we doing in here?  Here's the rules on how to listen properly.  I don't like this.  We haven't said Bubba's a fatso in a while.  Hey Bubba.  Did you have fun piling on yesterday?  Did you?  Did you fatso? 
[00:50:30]  Hiya.  Phony voice.  Phony bravado.  Phony violence.  It's just a fake.  Just a fake.  I'm so sick of phonies.  He wants to box you, doesn't he?  Yeah.  Doesn't he want to fist fight?  Doesn't he?  Yeah, that's great.  Does he?  In this glass office.  Weighing 800 pounds. 
[00:51:00]  Bubba the douche.  And in this corner.  Blubber Lang.  Blubber Lang.  And in this corner.  They call him old stinky fists.  Yeah.  Hey, we got some very good questions coming in from our instant feedback.  The instant feedback has exploded.  I guess this is the type of radio they enjoy hearing because it's the fullest.  No, no, you won't hear that from management. 
[00:51:30]  That's the type of stuff we've got to steer clear of.  Kent the movie guy writes,  How the fuck are you supposed to get drunk at the Christmas party and fuck the secretary when your office is glass?  That's true.  You can't even fucking Xerox your asshole.  They look right through.  The boss walks by and there you are on the copier with your little feet swinging.  Fucking asshole pictures collating in the little racks.  I wonder if you get fired for that in this day and age. 
[00:52:00]  Or if people just laugh.  Your ball's an asshole.  Color copier.  Yeah, you probably get a good shot nowadays.  Yeah.  Just reading that instant feedback, we're probably in trouble with HR.  I saw him taking a paper clip.  I saw him in the glass utility closet.  We're in trouble with HR now for reading the instant feedback about having sex with a secretary.  That's not good.  That could never happen.  That's not good.  It is a harassment-free environment in that glass office. 
[00:52:30]  Plus, I think most of the secretaries over there are like guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I say sweaty ass prints on every glass wall we can find with asshole imprint mandatory.  You spread, press, so you can just see the cheeks and the little pucker on all the glass windows.  So the fucking housekeeper or whatever they have at the end of the day has to go through bottles of Windex wiping stinky ass marks. 
[00:53:00]  Let's do it every day until they bring in the walls.  Until they have to go to Sheet Rock.  Yeah.  Like the good old days.  Oh, man.  They better start showing up at 430 if they don't want an ass print on their glass freaking office.  Daily ass prints, I say.  And maybe even an old cock and ball.  A greasy cock and ball.  Everyone, let's not shower for a week and just jerk off and have all sticky sack where you push it against the glass and it peels off like a fruit roll-up off of that plastic. 
[00:53:30]  By the way, I hope you're listening live because I...  Oh, this will all be cut out.  Wow, the show was only two hours today.  That's weird.  What happened?  How did that happen?  I love that gag.  It was a short show today.  I never understood that.  Like, something gets a little crazy on our radio show.  It's heard...  Hey, it's satellite.  It's heard live by, safe to say, a million people.  Maybe more.  I don't know. 
[00:54:00]  But it's safe to say a million.  And then all of a sudden they caught it from the replay.  But over a million people have already heard it.  So what are you really doing there?  I don't know.  Except taking a really good segment away from people that haven't heard it yet.  Yeah.  I never understood that.  The logic on that, and I've asked questions about that, and I've never gotten a good answer.  Like, how does that make sense?  Maybe if five people heard it, you can keep it hush-hush.  But when you do a live show and a good million people plus heard it originally... 
[00:54:30]  Well, in this day and age, you don't have really an outlet as an individual to put stuff out there  so a lot of people can see and hear it.  Right.  It's like they feel like, all right, if we caught it from the replay, it just goes away.  No, it's already out there.  And if it's really bad, Breach Bart will be all over it.  So there's nothing you can do anyway.  Stupid Breach Bart.  Oh, man, I'm on a war path.  Nah, they've been good for now, but trust me.  They're just sitting there waiting.  Waiting at the keyboard. 
[00:55:00]  I want to see everybody walk around that building with Band-Aids on their head  from just smashing into the fucking walls like parakeets.  Ow!  Ow!  And they have all those little, like, X's or something, eyeball height on all the walls.  And that's specifically so people don't walk into the wall.  They don't have walls that people think are invisible.  There should be a wall here.  Thud!  Ow!  There is!  It's glass.  You know who I feel sorry for this morning? 
[00:55:30]  Us!  Virginia.  Oh.  Good old Norfolk.  Yeah.  Boy, were they digging this radio show.  I know.  That PD was on the phone with that dope out there in L.A. every other day.  Every other day going, oh, God, the rumor's true.  I don't want to lose these guys.  I'm loving them, and the audience is loving them.  Yeah.  By the way, to stupid Howard and the rest of them, there's already interest out there.  But we've got to decide what we're going to do next.  That's all we can say for now.  So there's your failures. 
[00:56:00]  Other people already like trying to figure it out.  We have to figure it out, though.  You're the married guy, O.  I am?  So you have to get your wife in the news so she can get you in the news.  She is so not like that.  I can't even tell you.  No, it doesn't matter.  You have to because then your name will get in the news.  Because that's the only way it seems to work, right?  She's so the opposite of that.  I can't even tell you.  Trust me, she is. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, someone's saving a kitten.  Please, get Howard's name out there.  Your wife's holding a puppy.  We should play a song today.  What?  Just to get everybody pumped up for the rest of the radio show.  Yeah.  Coke Logic was so pissed.  He tweeted that the song of the day was Bulls on Parade.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  I'm more of a killing in the name of. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  Killing in the name of.  Yeah, I like that one, too.  You want to play a little killing?  Yeah, why not?  You got to kill time, so what the fuck?  I got to eat my half a bagel.  Hey, you got a little killing in the name of?  That's the one with Fuck You, right?  Of course.  I hope not.  I don't want to hear that type of salty talk.  Remember when we played at AAF that they had a weird edited version of that where it's  like...  They'd backwards it. 
[00:57:30]  Huh?  Or something.  Yep.  We'll play a little killing in the name.  Regroup.  Get into other things.  Yeah.  Thank you for everybody on Twitter that let me know what was going on out there in the  radio world.  Yeah.  Because it wasn't in the news, and I didn't hear it.  No.  Something like that would have made the news if Howard was taking those type of shots,  but now, you know, there's other ways to get DFO. 
[00:58:00]  I already got an email.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  So far, so good.  Mm-hmm.  Uh.  Mm-hmm.  Uh.  Someone being yelled at right now?  I doubt it.  Nah, it's stunt brain.  Just looking for love.  He got fired yesterday, officially.  Did he?  Yeah.  He got the boot?  Yeah, he's done.  Oh, shit.  He's done.  Wow.  And he was one of their guys.  Yeah.  We were never really their guys.  We were, like, subcontracting. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, we were on loan, basically.  Yeah.  We always knew that that was the weirdest situation in radio, and we were hoping to hang  on as long as we could, because it was just, the deal was just weird.  Yeah.  It didn't work, yes, but it was such a strange one, because neither company wanted to acknowledge  each other.  The companies hated each other.  That's why we had to walk from one studio to the other.  There were bad blood between the management, all this shit.  Yeah.  So we were the ones that had to suffer and go from one studio to the other. 
[00:59:00]  All this, whatever.  We could have, logistically, we could have done both shows from one studio.  They didn't want that.  No, even though they never had management around there to look after us.  No, no.  Anyway, I mean, Tom Chiasano, yes, but when they fired him, the plague took him over a  year ago.  Yeah.  About a year ago.  Since then, for the last year, we didn't see anyone.  I checked my voicemail, and there was Tom Chiasano.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't get to talk to him.  He goes, aren't you getting married soon?  I'm like, way to be on top of things, Tom.  I should have invited him, actually, but I thought it would be a little weird. 
[00:59:30]  I'm not really sure how connected he is to the other guy, and I didn't need that crap.  I like Tom, though.  What am I doing?  He turned out to be a good man.  But Stump Brain was their guy.  Yeah.  They loved him.  Yeah.  And he was there to kind of, like, be the liaison and make sure we're doing everything  right for that company.  Their interest would be met.  Right.  And he's been producing morning shows for two decades in New York. 
[01:00:00]  He's worked for everybody.  Yeah.  Literally everybody.  Boy, did they show him the boot yesterday.  Wow.  I tweeted that.  I said, CBS told Stump Brain to take his Rogaine Foam and hit the bricks.  Or Stunty.  Hey, rabies head, get the fuck out.  And that nerd, he goes, well, I guess I'm going to get some peace and quiet.  He goes, the public library today. 
[01:00:30]  And, like, we would write something like that on our Facebook or Twitter as a joke.  He means it.  He really meant that he was going to the public library to get some peace and quiet.  He puts on his satin running shorts and heads to the children's section and gives knee rides.  He's a creep.  He's day trading.  He texted me.  He's just day trading.  You think he wears the shorts that are a little too short that went out, you know, in the late 80s.  And half his ass cheeks hang out.  And then he reaches up for the books up on the top shelf. 
[01:01:00]  Older man, balls hang out.  He thinks it's sexy.  He thinks he's being seductive when he steps on the little yellow footstool ladder.  He's getting Horton Hears-a-Who off the top shelf.  Fucking awful older man, balls.  He doesn't even shave them right.  He's all depressed, too.  He goes, oh, I figure the Rogaine Foam looks like it's working.  It's not working.  Oh, boy.  His head is actually spitting out the remaining follicles angrily.  It looks like hair is growing, but it's actually digging down and pulling pubic hair through his skull and spitting it out. 
[01:01:30]  He doesn't notice that the hair on his toes is now gone.  It's being sucked up into his system and spat out.  Yeah, what he's seeing is probably the hair that fell out that is just laying flat on his scalp.  He's like, wow, it's working.  Taking a rest before they jump to their deaths.  Don't shake my head.  Don't wash.  Don't do anything.  Just let it sit there.  Someone's helping.  Kevin from Connecticut is helping me out with my reference.  He goes, 1979 NBA shorts.  They were wearing the short shorts in the 80s, my friend. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, true.  Give me a late 80s Michael Jordan.  Maybe not Michael Jordan.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  That's nice, Danny.  Thank you.  Oh, my God, Danny.  Oh, God.  We're looking at a picture of a guy in a beard.  He looks slightly gay.  I got it.  And half his ass is hanging out of his tight denim shorts.  He's wearing Daisy Dukes.  That's exactly what Stump Brain would look like, except he has short.  His are like a satin running short. 
[01:02:30]  See him walking into the library.  A very satiny running short.  The back of the shorts, like the bottom of the shorts are halfway up his ass cheeks.  Oh, my God.  It's disgusting.  And he's a hairy bear.  That gentleman that is in this picture.  If that was a girl and stuff, wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Is that just horrific?  Must be very warm there.  Yes.  Love the shorts. 
[01:03:00]  So Stump Brain is unemployed officially.  Wow.  They gave him a little bit of time, huh?  And then I guess the new station, just give me a little info.  Well, I guess they're starting today.  Whatever.  We could plug it all day.  It might work, but it's not going to be anything that anyone in radio could be proud of.  That's what young men are listening to.  The hits.  Yeah.  Well, they're going for...  The Jonas Brothers.  They're going for females and all that.  Even if the station is a hit, you can't be proud as a radio exec that that's not challenging.  Please.  Whatever. 
[01:03:30]  Whatever.  And I'm not disparaging anyone.  Trust me.  Just whatever.  But they had a local TV go in there and stuff.  Yeah.  And they put up the new logo where we used to sit and it's on all the computer screens,  right?  Are you kidding?  I think E-Rock told me that they used the board op or something to make believe he's part  of the station because they needed people to make it look like a lively shot.  Make it look like someone was in there.  And I want to blow up his spot, but it's one of our old guys that's still over there. 
[01:04:00]  It's just like...  No way.  Because he's younger, so it's like, all right, just sit behind the board.  Oh, no.  For this fucking piece they're doing.  Oh, I didn't see that.  It's hilarious.  Oh, shit.  That's got to be...  It's hilarious.  Putting up the big news sign.  Yeah, I remember when they did that with the K-Rock sign.  E-Rock, who was it?  Who was the person in the...  The Jibon?  Who did they use when they were trying to pump up the new station and they made believe  it like there were already people hired and they're working?  Oh, behind the board was a new hired street team promotions member. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  What happened to the K-Rock girls?  I guess they're gone.  They hired them and never did anything with them.  Another brilliant move.  Bye-bye.  The promotions guy from Fresh was also behind the board, too.  Right.  And the new chick that they hired from Philadelphia.  Wasn't one of our...  You said some...  Like a board op or something was also there?  Yeah, there was somebody else there.  And they cleaned out the studio.  There's no trace of anything. 
[01:05:00]  Like some of the equipment's even gone, too.  That was sitting next to Ope is totally gone.  So it's opened up now.  But they kept the big John Cena cutout right in the back.  The first thing that should have gone.  Spurgeoning thing is hunky.  The girls are like, there's hunks in the studio.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  This is the news clip from it, from yesterday.  They're going into some new frontiers.  Is this worth playing, though?  Just the chick.  New frontiers.  Yeah.  Let's take a listen.  I'd love to hear what we're replaced with. 
[01:05:30]  Look, I wish them luck.  It's not easy on regular radio.  But I don't think the Brainiac that's going to really figure out what regular radio is going to become is working yet.  Everything's just got to be Spanish or urban in New York City.  That's pretty much it.  That's what I've always said.  It's like, you know, you've got to go with the people.  And this is a weird one.  You've got to go with the people that don't have a lot of money.  But that doesn't help with advertisers.  Yeah.  Because the people that do have money, they just expect more.  So they search out a show like ours. 
[01:06:00]  Or they get their iPod.  Or they get their satellite radio.  Yep.  You know?  So you've got to just say goodbye to those people.  So long.  So who's left?  People that can't afford that stuff.  Yeah.  But then how do you get advertisers to want to advertise if the people that can't afford  don't have money to spend?  Because now how do they, yeah, spend money on the product that they're selling?  Because that's the bottom line is the commercials.  I truly believe that all that will become something else.  But the guy that's going to reinvent that whole thing is not even working the radio.  What's he, three years old right now, sucking his thumb? 
[01:06:30]  He's just somewhere else right now.  Yeah.  And somehow, you know, the planet's going to spin just right and this guy's going to  spin right into that world and it's going to become something.  Absolutely.  Whatever.  Good luck to you.  Radio is officially, regular radio is officially dead.  Keep up your good nature.  Radio station 92.3 FM is going top 40 starting at 5 p.m. tomorrow.  The station will play 10,000 songs in a row commercial free.  Wow.  That's crazy.  That's outrageous. 
[01:07:00]  Wow, 10,000.  In other words, shut up and play the music.  Right, which is, this is awesome, sure.  But you're getting people used to something and then you're going to take it away from  them, you idiots.  Remember a little station called WAPP?  Right.  They went commercial free.  For a summer, right?  Yeah, all summer they went commercial free.  It was the talk of New York City.  All you heard on Jones Beach was WAPP.  It was a monster.  BAB was shitting their pants because they were like the beach station and it was a monster. 
[01:07:30]  The second the summer ended, they went to regular programming with jocks and commercials  and it tanked to the point where I don't think it made it through the years.  They just pulled the fucking plug.  Yeah, it was one of the most amazing stories.  It was a monster.  They were huge.  Beyond huge.  And then they were gone shortly after that.  Maybe they lasted a year or two.  I don't know, but the initial holy shit went away really fast. 
[01:08:00]  All they're going to do is make people want satellite radio because you get used to hearing  things with no commercials 24 hours and then you fucking put a lot of commercials on it.  Well, I hope the people that are in charge at SiriusXM could figure out how to spin that  because you're absolutely right, Jimmy.  After 10,000 songs, when they hear that first commercial, that commercial is going to be  like the worst feeling to those people.  They're going to be like, oh, this is a fist in my ass.  What the fuck?  1-877-Cars-for-Kids.  1-877-Cars-for-Kids. 
[01:08:30]  1-877-Cars-for-Kids.  What?  What happened to the music?  Right.  I just counted.  That was 10,000 songs in a row.  Right.  All right, well, let's listen to this again because it's a big wow moment.  Radio station 92.3 FM is going top 40 starting at 5 p.m. tomorrow.  The station will play 10,000 songs in a row commercial-free.  Wow.  And they've hired Philly radio personality Lisa Page to help things along, and she will promise  to make a whole new kind of experience for listeners. 
[01:09:00]  Really?  Whole new kind of experience.  All right.  How is it new?  Let's hear the whole new kind of experience.  I want to hear how this is new.  By the way, this is CBS, right, locally?  Fox 5.  Oh, Fox 5.  Fox 5.  Was that Ernie Anastas?  Yeah, he's...  I know his voice.  Ernie's a dope.  For no reason.  No, trust me.  He just is.  I study this stuff.  He's literally a robot.  He always smiles.  He always smiles, and he has, like, no concept of, like, human emotion. 
[01:09:30]  Hey, easy.  People that work in glass offices.  That's right.  Couldn't have fun.  He talks to, like, the TMZ dude, like, he knows all about, like, Hollywood gossip.  He has no fucking clue who Britney Spears is a guarantee.  Another reader.  Another reader.  Yeah, but he acts like he's, you know...  Yeah, he's in on it.  You could read scrolling text.  Right.  Wow.  As far as blogs go, we're going to be doing lots of, like, Twittering and Facebooking. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, so that's new?  That's what we would...  That might be disparaging.  I doubt it.  I was using it as an endearing term.  Whatever.  And I was safe.  Whatever.  I pulled it.  Look, that's what we were doing.  Yeah.  We kind of introduced the radio world to Twittering.  We were Twittering and Facebooking and Myspacing well before and instant feedbacking and HTMLing 
[01:10:30]  websites back in 95.  We used Baud to get our shit out there.  I had fucking 300 Baud modem on my Commodore 64.  Oh, Christy.  Unbelievable.  This is going to be all new.  See, Twittering and Facebooking is a really good tool if you know how to do it.  But these idiots know what they're going to do.  Hey, uh...  Water it down. 
[01:11:00]  Uh, 10-15, we're going to give away no doubt tickets.  Yeah.  Tweet, tweet, tweet!  Update tweet!  Update tweet!  Uh, don't forget, uh, no doubt concert tickets going on sale Friday.  Tweet, tweet!  Here's the playlist for today.  Right.  They're not going to know how to use it the right way.  No.  They're just not.  And the lawyers are going to keep them from doing anything edgy that they would never do  anyway, but... 
[01:11:30]  And please get me these clips as they come in in the coming days.  I guarantee it's going to be, you know, tweet us your request.  Yeah, tweet us your request.  Look, if regular radio wants to move into the future, stop making believe you play fucking  requests.  You don't.  No, they never do.  I've been yelling about this for, ever since I started radio.  And I used to tell the listeners, I'm like, and I would play, quote, requests, but I would  go, look, I'm playing your song because it just happens to be on the playlist, so could 
[01:12:00]  you play along and stuff and make it sound cool?  But then I finally said, you know, I can't do this to the listeners anymore.  And I started telling them, like, do the fucking math.  We have well over a million listeners, you know, back a while.  And how many songs can we play an hour?  15 or 20, depending on how many commercials and how much the DJ babbles?  Yeah.  How many people do you think are requesting songs?  Really?  Perhaps more than that.  Right.  And try to request some obscure pop song.  Are they... 
[01:12:30]  They're going to, yeah.  Why does every request happen to be the top 10 pop songs in America?  So they should stop that right off the bat.  They should go on there and go, look, we don't play requests.  That's old radio.  That's not...  Why am I giving them the tools to succeed?  They roll tape, or nowadays it's all digital, but we say tape, still in the business.  They roll tape on every request that comes in.  Right.  And when they hit a person that is requesting a song that's coming up, then they save that,  and then they wait, and then they play that, and then they play the song. 
[01:13:00]  So it seems like the person is requesting the song, and the DJ is like, hey, let me get  that on for you.  Right.  But meanwhile, it's all been on a list that is stuck to religiously.  And I think the audience out there is more educated.  I really do.  But what's weird is the people that are in charge, they're not as educated as their  own listeners.  So they will, I swear to you, I will bet a lot of money here that they're going to 
[01:13:30]  go, tweet your request, too.  Tweet those requests.  Tweet, tweet, tweet!  I need to hear Lady Gaga update tweet!  Stupid tweet.  Just idiots.  That's how they're going to use that.  Instead of maybe giving them a little bit of a look into their personal lives, or a little  peek at this or that, it's going to be the lamest, lamest shit that they're going to  use their social networking for.  There's a gecko crawling up my office wall. 
[01:14:00]  Right.  Right.  Right.  They stick to glass.  Oh, geckos do.  Just geckos.  I want to get a bunch of geckos to stick them on the walls and crawl around.  Does anyone remember the old, it was like a spider or an octopus that you threw at glass  walls and then walk down the wall?  Walk down the wall.  We've got to get a shitload of those.  We should get a case of those.  Wacky wall walkers.  Wacky wall walkers.  Wacky wall walkers.  Maybe we can put our logo on it. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, that'll help.  But, yeah, and then they'll probably do like, well, we're going to have a tickle party.  Hey, tickle everybody.  Give me a poke.  Oh, I've got to hear this again.  All right.  Yeah, let me hear what new things are being introduced.  Look, we were saying Twitter people and Facebook and stuff for a while now, and this is new.  I'll tell you how I discovered Twitter. 
[01:15:00]  CNN.  CNN knows how to use this social networking.  There was a guy, his name is Martinez, I think.  He's on when I'm at the gym, and I popped the CNN on, right?  And he had this thing, Twitter.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  And then he's like, you know, whatever was happening on the news, he's like, if you want  to comment, you can tweet me.  That is fucking brilliant.  Yeah.  And they use it the right way.  Thought-provoking.  You can get involved with what they're doing on the news.  You don't need a reporter right there on the spot. 
[01:15:30]  Right.  You just get people that kind of say what's going on.  How is a Top 40 station going to do that?  Comment about the Lady Gaga song we're playing right now.  Let's dance, dance, dance, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, enough about the tweeting.  It's a page to help things along, and she will promise to make a whole new kind of experience  for listeners.  As far as blogs go, we're going to be doing lots of, like, Twittering and Facebooking 
[01:16:00]  and MySpacing and everything that we're using every day, BBMing, texting, we're a totally  personality.  Big, black, BD, BDSMing.  These beautiful memories.  We're going to be GFE.  No idea.  BBM?  No, BDM.  Is that what she said?  It's a BBM.  BBM.  Oh, my God.  We're going to be doing it.  BVW?  Yes.  That's what we're saying.  You request a song and a fat girl comes over and steps on your foot.  Right. 
[01:16:30]  Or Bubba.  Slob.  So that's going to be the big change, the big new thing.  Jay from Huntington is saying, oh, don't give CNN credit.  According to Ronnie B., you invented Twittering.  That's right.  I'm sorry, Jay.  You're right.  Fucking Ronnie.  We all know Opie invented Twitter.  Opie invented the Twittering.  All right.  Let's get back to this.  What was the one?  BD or BBMing? 
[01:17:00]  Do we know what BBMing is for real?  Is that what it said?  I'm pretty sure it's Blackberry Messenger.  Oh, that?  I can't imagine what else it would be.  What the fuck?  Just say it then.  Love a God.  My spacing and everything that we're using every day, BBMing, texting.  We're a totally personality-driven radio station.  And so we're really excited to just...  Isn't that what they just got rid of?  Yes.  Are they ever going to figure this out? 
[01:17:30]  They just got rid of that, though.  Didn't they just get rid of that?  And we wanted to utilize all that stuff.  And we were.  And we were.  And then whenever we wanted to use the webpage, they were always yelling at us that we couldn't  put anything on there.  Yeah.  And we couldn't plug the websites.  And we couldn't do anything.  Oh, God.  I wish I could talk to the potential listeners.  Oh, my God.  Because, see, this is the problem with the regular radio thing over there.  When you do use this social networking and these websites, instant feedback, O&A, show 
[01:18:00]  rundowns, it's all well and good until you start giving the people the really interesting  stuff.  Yeah.  That stuff never makes it anywhere.  Because they're paranoid about everything.  They get frightened.  So, trust me, that ain't going to work.  It's all going to be tweeting Lady Gaga.  Tweet!  Texting.  We're a totally personality-driven radio station. 
[01:18:30]  And so we're really excited to just get out there and meet our new listeners and show  New York City what we got.  All right, Lisa.  And station managers say that they're ready to take on Powerhouse Z100 and made the switch  because they found New York listeners prefer contemporary music to rock.  Good luck, man.  Seem to prefer anything to rock.  Good luck.  To tell you the truth.  Good luck, bro.  Godspeed.  Personality-driven. 
[01:19:00]  You're going to play 10,000 songs.  So they basically said, look, we don't believe in personality radio.  Yeah, what kind of personality is going to be fitting in 10,000 to 10,000 songs?  Look, we're good, but you know what?  No one could show their personality in 20 seconds.  It's very difficult.  Over an intro to a Lady Gaga song.  Oh, Lady Gaga!  Tweet!  Oh, my tweet's on the air!  My tweet's on the air!  I tweeted this song. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  Do you think they'll be tweeting what songs are coming up?  Oh.  Because that will get people back to the station.  Please.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you know what's going to happen?  Because in the social networking world, if you tweet a little too much or if you Facebook  a little too much, guess what?  People are like, enough with you, and they drop you.  They don't understand that part of the social networking thing.  People are going to be like, holy shit, I can't follow these fuckers anymore.  They're bothering me with... 
[01:20:00]  They're tweet bombing me.  It's basically Lady Gaga spam.  Enough about the Lady Gaga.  Lady Gaga.  I got it.  This is what it's going to be.  God.  This does good in New York?  Yeah, I mean, yeah, pop does well.  And like I said, I mean, it's not even a bitter thing.  Like, if I'm in radio and I'm a radio exec, I can't be proud if I put a pop station on the air 
[01:20:30]  and take credit for putting a good playlist out there.  What's the challenge in that?  None challenge.  None more challenge.  You're basically putting together a playlist that a 15-year-old girl could do.  Nice.  At least this discussion's getting hot.  Well, my reference point is nieces and stuff.  Yours is potential dates. 
[01:21:00]  Well.  Who the fuck listens to CNN at the gym slapping in?  Well, sorry I attempt to get a little knowledge.  If it's cooler, I also bring, you know, my, my, my, you know, and I crank out some alternative  rock music.  Oh, speaking of Lady Gaga.  Killing of the name.  Ready to roll?  All right.  We're going to do this.  We've been talking for an hour and a half.  So give us a break.  We're going to give me a fucking coffee.  Give me my fucking egg whites.  And we're going to rock.  Did anyone tweet this? 
[01:21:30]  Don't fucking tweet me with fucking song requests, you motherfuckers.  I'll drop you.  That's good.  I'll drop you like CBS dropped Stunt Brain in his Rogaine phone.  That was a good thing to say right there.  Yeah.  You watch what I do.  You watch what I do.  Is it easy to drop people on Twitter?  Very easy.  Very easy.  All right.  Because it's kind of a pain in the ass mobile-wise to get them off your Facebook.  I got to be at a computer.  Very easy.  Which sucks.  And then you got to look up the friend.  And then you got to, like, dump them.  It's a big pain in the ass.  It's a big to-do.  What's even better is having, well, don't be stupid. 
[01:22:00]  That's all I have to say.  That's my warning today to idiots out there.  If they weren't stupid, they wouldn't be listening to the OPN app.  I know.  That type of stupid I like and love like the rest of you guys.  They know what I'm trying to say.  Don't be stupid.  But that's your warning.  Here's Killing in the Name.  Here's Killing in the Name.
