<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of "Lean On Me" cereal, which Opie deemed excessively feminine due to its packaging and name.  This sparked a lengthy debate with guest Bill Burr about the cereal's perceived target audience and the high cost of clothing, specifically an Abercrombie & Fitch shirt Opie had purchased. Opie recounted a story about the enthusiastic female response to shirtless models at an Abercrombie & Fitch grand opening.  Listeners called in to share opinions on other potentially "gay" cereals. The conversation then shifted to a planned street prank involving leaving adult DVDs, a sex magazine, a dildo, and other items outside their studio to see how quickly they would be taken.  The show's pornography expert, Steve, contributed to a discussion about the legality and potential market for pornography featuring people with Down syndrome.  The broadcast then moved outside, where the hosts and crew (Danny and Nathaniel) conducted the street prank in real time.

The street prank segment detailed the reactions of pedestrians to the items placed on the sidewalk, focusing on a street cleaner's angry response and the eventual acquisition of the dildo by a black woman.  Legal concerns surrounding the prank were discussed, including phone calls with legal experts.  Michael Jackson's move to Bahrain was also briefly mentioned. Back in the studio, a caller raised concerns about the legal ramifications of distributing pornography in public. The hosts discussed their previous methods of quickly retrieving the material and brainstormed retaliatory pranks against a "mop guy" who had previously called the police on them.  A caller criticized the hosts for seemingly adhering more strictly to XM radio rules than they did on commercial radio. This led to a discussion of past arrests involving producer Rick, Jimmy Norton, Louis Black, and "Psycho Mark," and humorous speculation about their prison experiences.  The hosts detailed the stricter rules implemented at their XM studio following an incident involving a female guest, an employee, an ambulance, and the police;  these included removing a Jägermeister machine, locking a closet, stricter ID checks for female guests, and enforcing proper attire and sobriety for guests before leaving the studio.  They recounted other bizarre incidents involving intoxicated guests, including near-window jumping and choking on vomit.  Further implemented rules addressed safety concerns related to a wiffle bat and sobriety for stunt participants.  The hosts also discussed Howard Stern's purported "fake suspension" and proposed a business strategy for SiriusXM involving airing Stern's older, unedited shows.  An uncomfortable moment arose when studio guest Francine unknowingly mentioned Bill Burr's connection to the Dave Chappelle show, causing a brief break.

After the break, Francine attempted a news segment frequently interrupted by the hosts’ off-topic banter, covering topics including an Indian border fence, a female suicide bomber in Jordan, a sexual harassment lawsuit, and various celebrity news items.  The segment included a detailed discussion of Francine's personal experiences with anal sex, and a humorous anecdote about oral sex.  A caller, Steve, was briefly put on hold.  Another segment featured Francine demonstrating limited geographical knowledge and poor understanding of football, repeatedly quizzed by the hosts who highlighted her incorrect answers.  The recurring joke about Francine's previous interaction with Bill Burr led to escalating frustration.  A phone call with producer Steve revealed technical difficulties with an outside broadcast.  Francine offered a short sports update on Terrell Owens, followed by a comedic, inaccurate explanation of American football, punctuated by inappropriate jokes and interruptions.  The hosts mocked her misconceptions, using terms like "maginal line" and "camel toe."  A news story about a Missouri talk show host arrested for poisoning his wife with antifreeze prompted shock and vulgar commentary from the hosts, who played a wedding song juxtaposed with the news report.  Further segments included discussion of Opie’s DirectTV deal, audio from various 911 calls (including a grandmother shooting a prowler, a woman complaining about a Burger King order, and a dispatcher making a joke about shooting a child), promotion of the Ron and Fez show, a commercial for a fictional Jim Norton sensitivity training handbook, and a discussion about an upcoming shopping segment with Opie focusing on dress socks versus white socks.  A clip from Tyra Banks' show featuring people who stutter was played and criticized.


The final segment focused heavily on stuttering, beginning with a pre-recorded audio clip of a woman discussing her experience.  This led to anecdotes about stuttering, including a caller's story about his son and another about a 16-year-old's struggles.  The show featured James, a young man who overcame a stutter with a fluency device, along with his mother.  More audio clips related to stuttering were played, interspersed with the hosts' vulgar commentary and jokes. Tyra Banks was again mentioned.  Comedian Bill Burr was promoted.  The hosts frequently used offensive racial slurs and made sexually explicit and crude jokes throughout the broadcast, concluding with plans to go “shopping for cereal with questionable men.”

[00:03:00]  Thank you very much. 
[00:03:30]  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I can give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelch and I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is a despicable ass hat.  And these dummies that work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocks.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  This show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  Get him in here.  What?  What?  Come on, everybody.  Wake up.  Brian McChain.  Arr.  Yum, yum.  Oh, don't even.  Don't even.  Hey, Opie, what are you eating?  Yeah, what is he eating?  Ha, ha.  Cereal.  Yeah, cereal, all right.  With some bananas in it. 
[00:05:00]  Mm, mm.  That looks tasty.  Had to eat breakfast a little late today.  Yeah.  We're setting up for maybe a new bit today.  Uh-huh.  What do you got there?  We'll see how that goes.  You got some Wheaties?  Yeah, what do you got?  Breakfast of Champions?  Maybe some Cheerios.  Just your basic Cheerios.  Something like that.  Something a man would eat.  Something a man would eat in the morning.  There we go.  Something a man would eat in the morning.  Boy, we were.  Sort of toasted oats.  Right. 
[00:05:30]  Toasted oats.  You guys know what I'm eating.  Another manly cereal.  I'm not playing along.  Shredded wheat.  Oh, I know.  That's something healthy.  Even then, that's getting a little gay.  Is it?  Well, let me just explain before you kill me for the next 15 minutes.  I grabbed the bowl of cereal.  It's not a bowl.  You're eating it out of Tupperware.  The whole thing is just fucking ridiculous.  I don't have cereal bowls yet.  I just got a toaster.  I'm very happy with that purchase. 
[00:06:00]  So, I cut up a banana, threw some milk in there.  Yeah.  And then the box of cereal happened to be empty.  So, I just threw the box away right in front of Anthony, unfortunately.  It was almost in the garbage.  Almost.  We were sitting in the office.  It caught my eye out of the peripheral vision.  And I saw the gayest box I've ever seen in my life for cereal.  You could not find a more womanly cereal. 
[00:06:30]  Richard Simmons wouldn't eat that shit.  No.  You've got to take a picture of it and get it online.  Because I'm sure any description cannot do it justice in the faggotness of this box.  You hold up the box and they'll take the picture.  It is called, first of all, the name is what caught me.  I didn't even get the gayness of the box.  The name.  It's called Lean On Me.  And as it was being thrown into the garbage, I thought I saw Lean On Me and then thought, no. 
[00:07:00]  There's no way a cereal would use that.  I've never heard of it.  And would use that pun, like lean.  Because you want to be a lean, mean, fighting machine.  You want to be skinny.  Lean On Me.  And you want the lean to be on you.  You want lean on you.  Not fat.  Lean.  Lean On Noby.  The cereal is going to help you.  What?  The cereal is going to, like, help you.  It's going to help you.  Yeah, help you through your little diet. 
[00:07:30]  Look, man.  I know it's rough.  But lean on me.  Look, I'm going to lean on the box.  I'm leaning on the box.  No, it's even worse.  The worst part is that they've got a woman standing on one of those pediatrician scales.  This is what makes the box worse than ever.  Lean On Me.  But the picture Eric just got of you leaning on the box of cereal.  It's real gay.  It's real gay.  Well, I'm trying to portray how gay the box is.  Yeah, there's a woman.  I think it's Peggy Fleming. 
[00:08:00]  She does look sort of like Peggy Fleming.  She's got that little flip Mrs. Brady hairdo.  Did that come with little calcium pellets?  Stop the osteoporosis.  What was your other option?  Faggot crunch?  Yeah, this woman is in, like, this stretch pants type of sweat thing.  Olivia Newton-John.  Yeah, in the physical video.  Let's get physical.  She's wearing that.  And she's standing on her tippy toes on one of those doctor's office pediatrician scales. 
[00:08:30]  You put, like, breast milk in there when you eat.  What's the prize?  Add your bananas and add some milk.  We'll eat this lean on me.  It's awful.  What's the prize in it?  Yeah, was there a prize?  Tampon?  Keep going, man. 
[00:09:00]  Keep going.  I needed about ten more minutes to finish this bowl of goodness.  There is 6.25 grams of soy protein per serving.  How about that?  And that's, like, put on the front of the box like that's its big selling point.  High protein, high fiber, low fat.  What's all that copy on the box?  How to keep your boyfriend?  Yeah, I know.  How to get a man?  There's a novel on this thing.  Every panel is full of text.  How to drive him crazy in bed.  What? 
[00:09:30]  It's like a Cosmo.  Page out of Cosmo.  Taped onto the back and the side.  Ladies, now that you have your new lean on me figure.  Look, man.  Now it's time to deal with your relationship.  Keep that man.  Look, man.  I'm just trying to keep up.  That's all I have to say about that.  Keep up, huh?  You know so I'm wearing a brand new shirt today?  Hey, what happened?  Why don't you just work out, man?  Just lift some weights and you can eat, like, Froot Loops.  I lift.  I work out.  An Abercrombie and Fitz shirt.  Ah, you're buying new clothes, are you? 
[00:10:00]  This is a $70 shirt.  Stop it.  Swear to God.  Wow.  And it looks like it's, what, $10?  Yeah.  It's just a pullover.  That's one of those designer rugged shirts.  Yeah.  Like he actually lifts shit for a living.  What the fuck is going on with the...  Other than your box of lean on me?  Lean on me.  I'm going to explain.  I'm just trying to keep up, brothers.  That's all I'm saying.  You should have bought the robe.  Abercrombie and Fitz just opened up, like, a superstore on Fifth Avenue here in New York City.  They did. 
[00:10:30]  What the hell's going on with the price of clothes, first of all?  I swear to God, this is a $70 shirt.  Well, when was the last time you were out actually buying clothes, Opie?  You haven't had any...  Were you in the men or women section?  In the lean on me section?  Just trying to keep up.  I'll explain.  $70, though, for this shirt that obviously looks like it should cost maybe $20 tops.  Yeah.  But it's $70 because this is what happens now, right?  What are you, like a size 4?  I'm a size double zero. 
[00:11:00]  And I still feel fat.  Right.  I didn't even know they had size double zeros.  Going to the bathroom and binge after this?  Look at this.  Why?  She's standing on her tippy toes.  On her little tippy toes.  Yeah.  Well, I got to explain, though, if you'll let me have the...  You can have the floor and explain why, out of all the cereals that are out there, very  nutritious cereals that are out there.  Because they're not even trying to advertise to a man. 
[00:11:30]  They're like, no guy would ever buy it.  Lean on me.  Absolutely.  Even, like, the text, the font is effeminate.  Very feminine, soft font.  It's loaded with a...  It just makes you feel light as you read it, doesn't it?  The whole thing is just like you're floating away.  I'll tell you one thing.  I've already gone through like a half a quart of milk, too.  Really?  Yeah.  This cereal just soaks it up.  It soaks it up.  Like a sponge.  I'm just trying to keep up, brothers.  Yeah.  That's all I'm trying to do.  That's because you chicks, you always have, like, deficiency in calcium. 
[00:12:00]  I'm going to explain now.  Please explain why that was the only box of cereal available to you.  Because I'm trying to keep up.  That's all I'm saying.  I went to Abercrombie & Fitch, Fifth Avenue, brand new superstore.  I like some of the Abercrombie & Fitch stuff every once in a while.  Sure.  And we're walking around the city over the weekend.  Me and Lindsay and a few other people.  And all the girls.  Well, there were a few girls in my posse.  Did you have a hat box as you were walking down the street? 
[00:12:30]  Including my girlfriend.  And all of a sudden, I see a big commotion outside the Abercrombie & Fitch store.  Oh, a commotion.  Must have been a sale.  Well, that's what you would think.  But I guess it was the grand opening of Abercrombie & Fitch, right?  I thought maybe they were giving away free boxes of lean on me.  And then I get closer and I see all the women.  They got their cameras out.  Uh-oh.  They got their cameras out.  Uh-oh.  Here comes a B movie star.  Dude, you're walking into the lobby or whatever you call it, the opening of the Abercrombie & Fitch store there, right? 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And they got two of the fucking male models there for the grand opening.  That's it?  Just two models?  With, like, no shirts on.  They have eight packs.  Ooh.  This sounds exciting.  Give me a bowl of lean on me and tell me all about it.  I want a figure like that.  They have eight packs.  They're like the new models for Abercrombie & Fitch.  So the girls are all losing their fucking minds taking pictures with the... 
[00:13:30]  You can see their panties getting moist right in front of you.  A little dampness.  They're just losing their minds.  And then I walk into the fucking store like, oh, great.  And then I'm trying on clothes and my one pack...  So I'm just trying to keep up.  One big, lumpy, mushy ab.  Just like little teenage girls out there, I'm influenced by advertising.  Yeah, but trying to keep up.  At this point, trying to keep up with that, you need a time machine.  You should have saw these ladies. 
[00:14:00]  Those models are fucking...  What are they, 23?  Who knows?  I mean, obviously, I'm just kidding.  But, I mean, just to see these, like, older women just losing their fucking minds,  getting their pictures taken with these stupid models.  So why don't you just have a can of tuna?  And that does not explain Lean On Me at all.  There is, like I said, cereal of the yin-yang, as they say.  Different types of...  What made you, looking at all the cereal, 
[00:14:30]  what made you choose that box?  There's always something on a box or a product that makes you get it.  Abs or, like, breasts?  I, um...  Every time I'm in the supermarket, I try a new cereal.  Little known fact.  And a lot of...  All right.  Little known.  And a lot of times, if there's someone near the cereal area in the supermarket,  I'll just openly ask them, what's your favorite cereal?  I'm not buying this.  I swear to God.  Trying to blame other people.  But in this case, I decided, yes, to try the Lean On Me. 
[00:15:00]  It looked...  The picture on the box looked very delicious.  It did not.  That looks like a woman's cereal.  That is as embarrassing, bringing up, to the cashier, as tampons or Kotex or something like that.  It really is.  It is a very feminine box.  I'll be that you are.  Yeah, but I also had a couple poor houses with it.  All that outweighed it?  Yeah, just to distract the cashier a little bit.  I had a couple poor houses. 
[00:15:30]  Issue a hustler.  I had a six-pack of PBR.  Yeah, Playboy magazine.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just going to go home.  And a little bit of skim milk for my Lean On Me cereal.  For your Lean On Me.  I just...  I couldn't...  I couldn't understand why you would buy that when there's something like maybe Wheaties or...  I don't know.  I try all the cereals, I guess.  No.  This one is...  There's a line, Opie.  This is...  You definitely crossed it.  This one's better than that Optimum thing I was eating. 
[00:16:00]  What?  Where I wasn't shitting for three or four days?  What the hell was it called?  Optimum?  The Kashi?  I forget.  I forget what it was called, but...  It was...  There wasn't a broad on a scale.  It was really clogging me up.  Oh, there it is.  What?  Right there.  Which one?  The one that says Optimum.  Right.  What is that?  A list of gay cereals?  I'm not doing that.  You've got it on the...  Cereals available in Chelsea.  I was eating the Optimum.  Hey, there's a coupon for rollerblades on the back of this thing. 
[00:16:30]  Seventeen box tops.  You get a pair of purple rollerblades.  I was eating the Optimum Power breakfast cereal.  Who makes that?  Nature's Path.  Organic.  How do these people stay in business?  Flack.  Who else bought Lean On Me?  I've been around for many years.  I've never seen Lean On Me cereal.  There's no commercials for it.  And looking at the cereal aisle, walking through it, I definitely would have noticed that box. 
[00:17:00]  Comes with a barf bag.  Teaches you how to...  Put a little bulimic in you.  Teaches you how to tickle the back of your throat just right to barf.  Yeah, you could use that box to puke in as well.  Little known fact about the Lean On Me box.  And it's such cheap cardboard.  Like, feel the cardboard.  It's not like a Kellogg's box.  You guys are right.  I think it's barely glued together.  It's like recycled, bad cardboard.  The model could have been a little better, right? 
[00:17:30]  No.  This is exactly what should be on here.  Right.  This poor excuse for Jenna Elfman.  They got it figured out.  I thought she looked like somebody.  That's it.  Let's say hi.  The face panel has a Jenna Elfman.  We're creating more healthy, tasteful, and appealing recipes.  It's a recipe.  Is that what it says on the box?  Recipes.  Can you make s'mores out of this?  Sure.  Let's say hi to Vinny in New York.  Vinny.  You.  What's up, man?  Hey, I think I saw that in the store. 
[00:18:00]  The free prize inside is an IUD.  Thank you, bro.  Thanks a lot.  Punching out.  All right.  Well, is there a gayer cereal?  No.  Well, I'm not going to accept your answer.  I absolutely would defy you.  I'm going to do a little research to see if there's a gayer cereal in there.  A gayer cereal for a man to buy.  Defining, like, a straight guy to buy it like that's gay.  There's nothing worse than that.  No.  There's got to be one out there.  That is a woman's cereal.  That is like, there's another woman product. 
[00:18:30]  Gay guys are probably trying to overcompensate and they're actually buying Wheaties.  Yeah.  Nobody?  Right.  Nobody went and done one?  Nothing.  I like it.  I had to let it sift through for a second.  I was swallowing.  I was thinking, Opie, Opie, understand me.  There are, there's a cereal out there that is exactly the same ingredients as that.  Exactly.  All right.  But it's presented as a manly thing.  There are certain products.  You ever see, like, the Lady Bic razor and then the Bic man razor? 
[00:19:00]  Mm-hmm.  Would you buy the Lady Bic for something to shave with?  I think it would.  That's what, you think it would?  Yeah.  So.  There are, like, men products and women products, even though they're the same thing.  Like, that's the lady product version of that cereal.  Yeah, like, when you go up to the register, the other thing should be, like, those little  eggs with the pantyhose in it.  Right, right.  Like, the legs, eggs, pantyhose.  All right, all right.  Exactly.  Hey, we're saying your cereal's fucking queer.  I haven't picked up on that yet. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, but who would know that I was eating this?  Everybody now?  Yeah, because you noticed I was throwing the box away, because I didn't have time to, like,  you know, pack my cereal individually like I do.  I just don't.  I grabbed the box and run out today.  Yeah.  Did you get it in a supermarket or a bodega?  In a supermarket.  I will find a worse cereal.  What about Optimum Zen?  That's stupid and silly, but it's not as faggy.  It's the kind of cereal you eat right after you gave birth. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, a doctor would tell you.  You're thinking about killing your baby because you're so depressed.  You got postpartum, and your doctor recommends, let me recommend Lean On Me cereal.  You can find it at any fag store.  Four grams of estrogen.  Yeah, estrogen.  I wanted to put my baby in the microwave until I ate Lean On Me.  Jim from Brooklyn, what's up?  It helps to relax.  Opie, you didn't catch the easiest way out of this of all.  What?  Lindsay bought it for me. 
[00:20:30]  I know, but...  I can't believe you didn't grab that.  I can accept my turn in the barrel.  No.  You know why that wouldn't have worked?  He took it to work, which just shows he had no problem with it.  He didn't see a problem with it.  Oh, that's right.  You saw no issue with that cereal.  I still see no problem with it.  Yes, you do.  You have to.  No.  Don't.  Show him the cover.  Again, maybe he didn't see a good view of it, Bill.  I don't have a problem with it.  Look at the woman on her tippy toes on the scale.  Look at it.  And not only that, when we found it in the basket, your head, everything, just your whole 
[00:21:00]  body language just was looking right down at the all-weather carpet that you have here.  You were so busy and preoccupied this morning, you didn't realize you left the house with  that gay box.  And does he or does he not rollerblade over here?  On a daily basis.  He's been eating the cereal for a while.  It says on the back, 26 box tops.  Get your rollerblades.  Hold on.  This is what I've been waiting for.  Joe's going to help me out.  They make a version of alphabets, but the only letters are H, I, and V. 
[00:21:30]  That's it.  Joe, Connecticut.  Yeah, hi.  What's up, Joe?  Hey, there was a cereal that used to be called Serenity, I think.  It was made specifically for women.  I think that might be gay.  Serenity?  Isn't that a diaper?  Isn't that an adult diaper?  I think that was the name of it.  It was a general cereal.  All right, if we could find a box of cereal called Serenity, that's worse.  All depends on what the box looks like. 
[00:22:00]  Why don't we go to your apartment and look in the cupboards?  He didn't find that in a grocery store.  I work at Stop and Shop and have never even heard of that.  Really?  Yeah.  That's, I don't know where you...  That's a specialty store.  Like, regardless of what's even on the box, I wouldn't buy it because I've never heard  of it.  Like, I would...  And I would have assumed it would have been sitting there for months.  It's a specialty store and you walk in and, like, the carpenters are playing on the overhead  music speaker thing or whatever. 
[00:22:30]  We've only just begun.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  We got a...  You got a problem over there.  You got to be careful of those soy cereals because they contain estrogen for menopausal  women.  Oh, is that it?  That's it, man.  A lot of those cereals are just...  They're just...  You know, they do exactly what you were saying.  They got to keep those women from drowning the babies.  Yeah.  All right.  Maybe that's why I'm not as angry these days.  Yeah, maybe.  Let's say hi to Aaron in Michigan. 
[00:23:00]  Aaron.  Oh, B, don't feel bad.  I suck dick for breakfast, too.  Punch it out.  What an asshole.  You both get your serving of protein for the day, right in the morning.  No, I'm getting soy.  Soy protein, yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to use wolfing that shit down just trying to end this.  It lasts forever.  My God.  I've been chewing for 25 minutes.  God damn.  Opie, how are you going to lose any weight when you...  Yeah, you've got a whole trough of it over there.  Huge Tupperware thing of lean on me. 
[00:23:30]  I've been chewing and chewing and chewing.  This cereal is expanding as I chew.  Oh, the picture...  That is a gay picture.  Oh, awesome.  There's a picture of Anthony leaning on the box and leaning on me on the website.  Go to opianthony.com.  I'll have to take a look at that.  Yeah, there's a window over it.  There's a window over it, Eric.  You're all excited to show Bill, but he can't see.  I was trying to figure out what the hell that was.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  Where is it on the site? 
[00:24:00]  What are you doing, Eric?  Trying to find out where that window came from.  I can't find it.  You can't find it?  No.  I went to opiandanthony.com.  Let's say hi to Peter.  Hey, guys.  You're forgetting the obvious.  Huh?  Special K and Strawberry Special K.  Strawberry Special...  I've seen that in the supermarket, yeah.  Special K isn't bad.  It has a Strawberry Super K, which is a little...  Yeah, they usually got a woman in a workout suit or something on the front.  Where the hell is it?  Thanks, sir. 
[00:24:30]  Let's say hi to Miles.  Miles!  Yeah, I work at a grocery store.  Yeah.  And we got this one there, and it's called Good Friend Cereal.  Oh, is that the black and white couple?  Yeah, the black and white couple, and they're all happy on the front.  Dude, that could be worse.  Definitely.  It's called Good Friends?  Yeah, and it's a black guy and a...  Good Fun.  Wait, it's a black guy and, like, an Asian woman or something like that?  No, it's a black guy and a white girl.  Yeah, and the cereal's called Good Friends. 
[00:25:00]  Come on, that's a little worse.  Good Friends?  I have to see the box.  What is that?  Don't worry, racist, we're not fucking cereal.  We're just Good Friends.  I've seen that box, and I study it every time I'm in the supermarket.  I'm trying to figure out what that's all about.  I'm seeing it.  Good Friends.  Yeah, show that to Bill.  Here's the box.  Look, it's...  It's Kashi.  It's the Kashi brand.  Does the Klan put that out?  To kill all race traders? 
[00:25:30]  That is awful.  There's different boxes.  There's one here with, like, looks like a married couple on the front.  No, but they're good friends.  But they're good friends, and some, like, older...  The guy looks possessed.  Which one is that?  And then there's another one with what seems to be a couple of lesbians.  Mm-hmm.  One a black woman, I think, or is she Indian?  Oh, I see the lesbian couple.  And then the other one that looks like two actresses jammed together into one. 
[00:26:00]  I can't quite figure out.  That looks like an Eskimo and a grandmother.  Like, show Bill Burr this one.  Who the hell are they catering to?  It's like an older black guy kind of has his arms around this white chick.  No, he's kind of Asian or something.  He's like Cambodian.  He's Samoan.  I don't know what he is.  No, he's got, like...  That's like Nancy Reagan meets the Killing Fields.  Yeah.  They're trying to throw as many nationalities as possible.  Oh, absolutely.  Into that couple.  That's what they're trying on the box of good friends.  Now I see the Asian, but at first I saw the black. 
[00:26:30]  Right?  Yeah.  I don't know.  But either way, there's no woman on her tippy toes standing on a scale.  True.  Let's say hi to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate.  Morning, guys.  Morning, Nate.  I just wanted to know, does the cereal come in a periwinkle box?  Take it easy, shit pics.  So out of this, you're going to buy, like, I Will Survive cereal next?  I Will Survive.  Gloria Gaynor CD in the box. 
[00:27:00]  Some guy, actually, I found a site about good friends cereal, and some guy, I guess, you  know how it is these days with your blogs.  He tried it out.  The box art is some of the worst I've seen for any food packaging, and that includes the  white pretzel bag with the black lettering that simply announces you are buying pretzels.  The good friends in question seem to be Siamese twins, or a special kind of good friends.  Two women illustrate my point.  Then he eats it. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, my God.  It was horrible.  He poured the bowl, most unappetizing sight of all time.  He tried it, wound up dumping it into the toilet, dumping his good friends down the toilet, he said.  Have you seen that one cereal?  It's called Gorilla Munch.  I swear to God.  Gorilla Munch?  Gorilla Munch.  I was going to mail a box to Patrice just to freak him out with, like, a hate letter,  you know, when you cut, like, all the different words out of the paper. 
[00:28:00]  Right, like a ransom note.  Yeah.  Oh, man, that's funny.  It's like a cartoon drawing of a gorilla.  Why are, why are, oh, God.  Why is Saturday's paper in front of us?  Oh, two Saturday papers.  That's good.  Huh?  Oh, here's Gorilla Munch.  Oh.  Why would they throw Saturday's papers in front of us?  At least the cover of Gorilla Munch looks fun.  It's like cartoony.  Right.  You know, and the letters are all wacky, kind of not in a straight line. 
[00:28:30]  That's too wacky.  There's not a gorilla on a scale?  No, not on his little tippy toes that look like fingers.  There's four tippy toes and his thumb.  And his opposable thumb on his foot.  He holds the bowl in his foot.  Let's say hi to John in Long Island.  John, we've got to bring in a manual.  Yes, John.  Listen, either eat or talk.  Don't do it, Paul.  I want to spit in your face. 
[00:29:00]  What did he say?  He doesn't like when you eat and talk, I guess.  Oh.  Well, I can't help it.  I had to eat late today.  Let Bill and Anthony talk.  They were doing a very nice job without you.  He was eating and swallowing and then talking, my friend.  I was barely talking there.  I know what he's saying.  I know what he's saying.  John, that's annoying.  All right, John.  Well, they're making fun of me, and I had to comment a little bit to keep it going.  No?  I can't just sit here and just nod my head like, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  He had to let the people at home know that he was actually eating the cereal. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  Yeah.  That we weren't making this up.  We've got to bring, like, a manly cereal in here tomorrow for him.  All right, Mike in Kentucky.  Grape nuts.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Well, I'm sick of the oatmeal, so I'm trying to, like, you know, eat other crap.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, just want to let you know, healthy men's breakfast equals grape nuts.  Opie equals no nuts.  Aw.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you.  Punch it out, boys.  All right.  My review on Lean on Me, by the way. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, we get a review.  Not so good.  Not so good?  Not so good.  What's wrong with it?  What do you mean?  You ate the whole box.  Because I had to eat something.  Does it taste vitamin-y?  It just tastes like if you'd cut up, like, cardboard.  Yeah.  And just throw it in a bowl.  Yeah, you're not eating those for enjoyment.  It's not like a, mm, that's tasty.  Maybe throw just some little, little twigs in there.  I think it means you have a wedding coming up.  And then maybe some- 
[00:30:30]  You want to be able to fit into your dress.  Right.  Why don't you go with Cheerios?  You'd like-  What's wrong with Cheerios?  Cowardly yellow box?  Too much sodium?  No, I like Honey Nut Cheerios, actually.  You do?  You've never brought that in?  I certainly do.  I love Honey Nut Cheerios.  I've never seen that.  That's one of my faves.  That's the gay Cheerios with that little bee buzzing around.  Thanks, Bill.  Jesus.  Let's have some toasted oats.  Little Honey.  Little circle jerk of bees. 
[00:31:00]  All right, you guys done?  It was fun.  It was fun.  Comedy comes in threes.  What else do you eat?  You're all done with your lean on meat.  You're done with it.  The box is empty.  I guess you won't be buying that anymore now?  No, I don't think so.  Yeah.  To be honest with you.  No, no.  But I'll try something else.  Yeah.  Maybe I'll try that Gorilla Crunch.  Gorilla Munch.  Munch?  Gorilla Munch.  I don't see any people.  I don't see anybody photoshopping.  Lesbians eat that. 
[00:31:30]  Right before oral sex.  Gorilla Munch.  Well, here's Rich from Philly.  Rich?  Yo, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Rich.  Yeah, I got a slogan for that cereal for you.  Yeah.  It's their day.  All right.  Punch it out.  All right.  Bye.  Wade in Toronto.  Wade.  How's it going, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Billy.  When did you ever get up to Toronto, man?  What's that?  Does Billy ever make it up to Toronto? 
[00:32:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  We're going to be part of XM Canada, so I think we're going to have to start taking a look  at what's going on in Canada.  Oh, man.  You guys got big-time advertising up here, man, but nothing with your billboard yet.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  Oh, well, we just had a call from Philly.  I just want to remind everybody.  Someone from Whackbag sent this in.  Hey, you guys have a full-page ad in today's Philly Inquirer in the sports section.  On page five, it's an XM ad only for Opie and Anthony.  It's the first time I can remember seeing one here in Philly, and it's on E5 in the 
[00:32:30]  Philly Inquirer today.  A huge one-page Opie and Anthony ad.  That's very cool.  Thank you, XM.  And I guess we got the same thing happening here in New York in the New York Post and the  Daily News.  It's the entire page.  It's amazing.  Full color.  I could not look gay or leaning on the lean-on-me cereal box.  I know.  You just fucked it up, man.  It was all about me, but they got a picture of you leaning on the box.  And they're not going to remember either.  That's true.  Kind of like when Britney and Christina kissed Madonna.  Right.  And people only remember Madonna. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, no one remembers freaking...  Exactly.  Well, they remember Britney over Christina Aguilera.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, exactly.  And the full-page Opie and Anthony ad is also in the Boston Herald today.  So, XM, coming to the plate today.  We're in the Daily News, the Post, Boston Herald, and the Philly Inquirer, all with one-page  Opie and Anthony ads.  Bravo.  Thank you.  All right, we're going to take our first break.  We've got Bill Burr in studio.  We'll catch up with him.  See what he's been up to.  And we've got lots to do.  Are there people on the street yet, Anthony?  Let me take a look. 
[00:33:30]  A couple.  Yeah, I see him walking around.  All right.  One more.  Oh, Wade, you wanted to say something.  I cut you off.  I'm sorry.  No, it's all right, man.  It's all right.  Hey, Bill, take a look, man.  That new Abercrombie and Fitz shirt he's wearing.  Is it cut a little low?  Can it show his belly button?  And if you look under the console, can you see leg warmers on him?  I don't have leg warmers.  All right.  Enough.  He actually has on his oversized boyfriend shirt.  It's oversized?  I was going to go medium. 
[00:34:00]  Now I'm paranoid.  Is it oversized?  No, I'm just, I don't know.  I'm just going with the whole gay bash.  That's the look.  That's what we started with, and I'm going with it.  All right.  I have no idea.  We've got to go on our shopping spree today, and I have no idea.  That's Greg Brady necklace.  Oh, wow.  Do you have beads leading into your bedroom instead of a door?  What's wrong with my necklace?  Oh, God.  I've been wearing these necklaces for many years, Bill. 
[00:34:30]  Hey.  We can't all look as cool as you in that ACDC t-shirt.  It's not a tiki.  It's a necklace.  Yeah, we are going on a shopping spree today, aren't we?  Yeah.  This is, I want to talk, we'll talk about that after the break.  All right.  All right.  Who are we going with?  Where are we going?  What are we doing?  I don't know.  Do we have answers to any of those questions?  I need answers.  Can we get answers to those questions?  Because I'm not going to just wander around.  They said they have a plan.  Let me tell you.  What's the plan?  I want to know what the plan is, because I have a huge wardrobe. 
[00:35:00]  You really do.  I do.  Huge.  For any occasion.  I could be on a GoLean box, or I could be on a job site, and anywhere in between.  I have an outfit for it all.  I don't know why we have to go on this shopping spree.  Oh, yeah.  With a feather duster.  Sure.  I put my ass out.  Who doesn't?  I want to know why we're doing this.  We have a photo shoot tomorrow, and apparently they don't think we're responsible enough  to bring clothing that reflects what they want to capture in this photo shoot. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  There's something going on we're not filled in on yet.  Right.  So they want to take us shopping.  But look at your shirt.  What's wrong with a shirt?  It's a fine shirt to come into our shirt.  It looks more like a tablecloth than a napkin, my friend.  It's like those picnic disposable napkins.  Anthony has on a recycled shirt.  It was made out of napkins.  Yes, I'm doing my part. 
[00:36:00]  Very good.  I just want to know what we're doing and who now is making decisions on how we're to look.  Are they going to look and go, no, that's not good?  Do we pick out what we wear to someone else?  And then we have to say that's good or not.  Who are we going with?  Let me ask you this.  Are they hetero guys?  Are they gay guys?  Is it a makeover?  What is this?  That happy one-year anniversary poster you guys have there?  Who dressed you guys in that?  We dressed ourselves, Bill.  We did.  That's the best I've seen you guys look.  Thank you, sir.  Isn't that wonderful? 
[00:36:30]  Thank you.  Yeah.  Sing?  I'm wearing a black Kenneth Cole collared shirt.  You guys are both doing the I'm good in bed face.  He's smoldering.  No, we got very confident faces in that picture.  Very confident.  Very confident.  All right.  We're going to take our first break.  Bill Burr in the house today.  We got lots to do, and we'll explain it all next.  All right?  Bill and Anthony Harris get infected.  Why do they even report radio in the newspaper? 
[00:37:00]  Huh?  I don't even know why they report radio in the newspaper.  It's got to just be thankless to be the radio reporter.  You walk around in the Daily News building or the Post building,  and you're like, there he goes.  It's the radio reporter.  You know, they're just like looking at him going,  this guy is like one more technological jump closer to unemployment.  Like, they're just not going to report on it anymore.  Who's lower, radio guy or crossword puzzle guy?  Is there even a guy? 
[00:37:30]  Or the bridge guy.  You know, the guy that writes the bridge column?  Right.  Oh, queen to your left?  Like, I don't even understand the game.  And that's like a horrible, these are, can't you put ads in those spaces and make a little money?  I've been thinking about that for years, you know, reading the newspaper every day.  There's so much shit in here.  And you've got to think, you know, you're looking for an audience for all this stuff.  Yeah.  How many people are reading the queen's left bridge? 
[00:38:00]  Let me think.  I'm buying the paper.  Just throw the rest away.  Give me the bridge page, because I've got to know what to do.  If I just drew a king, jack, queen.  Bridge.  What fucking year is this?  What century is this?  Bridge.  Hmm.  Unbelievable that they still have the bridge.  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  And I read Gridlock Sam all the time.  Gridlock Sam.  Gridlock Sam.  Sam Schwartz. 
[00:38:30]  My God.  He lets you know where the traffic is.  Okay.  Dude, when is the paper printed?  Is this guy a fucking psychic?  Wouldn't he be better to tell you what the lotto numbers are going to be than where traffic  might be in the morning when the fucking paper comes out?  I predict a tractor-trailer jackknife on the FDR.  But it's Gridlock Sam.  It's Sam Schwartz, and he knows everything.  He certainly does.  Why would you put a traffic reporter in the newspaper?  What, are you reading this while you're driving? 
[00:39:00]  You have the folded up paper?  Hey, what's this accident?  It doesn't say anything about this in the paper.  What a dope.  Gridlock Sam says, I should avoid...  Oh, he was right.  Fucking grit.  This Sam is great.  I'm going to get on the park.  No, I'm not.  And Sam said I shouldn't.  Traffic in the paper.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program, the ONA virus spreading across America, 
[00:39:30]  thanks to XM Satellite Radio, and thank you to XM for advertising the fucking program today.  Yes.  We greatly appreciate it.  We got full-page ads in the New York Post, the Daily News here in New York, also the Philadelphia  Inquirer on page E5, I believe, and the Boston Herald as well. 
[00:40:00]  You know, they advertise here and there, they give us a little spot here and there, but today  it's all about us!  Isn't that nice?  Very nice.  Thank you.  Wow, the music shouldn't have ended there.  I was, like, really feeling the groove, and I was screaming, it's all about us.  You put the exclamation point on the end.  And then the music was gone.  And it stopped.  All right, we're going to try something brand new today.  Oh, wait, do we have the item?  Okay, yeah.  All right, I kind of got this idea because recently I've been kind of clearing out my 
[00:40:30]  apartment.  I've been throwing away a lot of old clothes.  I threw away about 50 pounds of clothes.  50 pounds of clothes?  Easily.  Easily.  Maybe more.  No interns got any this time around?  No, no, no.  You guys made fun of me.  A toaster that doesn't work.  I went through my CD collection.  Because, you know, with the iPods and downloading of music and stuff, I'm starting to look at  my CDs like, what a waste.  Yeah.  In another year. 
[00:41:00]  Do you have it backed up on another hard drive?  The ones I want.  The ones I want, I got.  Yeah, you got to back that shit up.  And to be honest, like, I didn't bail on my U2 collection or my Rolling Stones collection,  stuff like that.  It was borderline stuff.  Like, will I really throw this in?  You need shit for the vehicle, though.  Huh?  Yeah, I know.  Like, still need CDs for the car.  I'm all about the XM in the car.  Yeah.  Where it records and stuff.  So when you're on a cell phone, next thing you know, you go back and see what it recorded 
[00:41:30]  for you.  I love that.  Love that feature.  Oh, is that what you're doing with your new XM?  As far as driving around XM, all my needs musically.  Yeah.  Yeah, because I have all the channels I like listening to and I just pop around and there's  always a song on there I want to listen to.  No problem.  Like ABBA with your box of lean on me.  I use XM for the gayer music that you wouldn't want people to know that you're listening to.  You can't buy a CD with, like, you know, the music from Greece. 
[00:42:00]  But if it pops on the 70s channel, you could sing along with the window shut.  It's like watching you just trying to think of some gay music, you're like, somebody help  me.  Somebody, anybody.  Good answer.  That's gay.  Gay music, grace.  So I've been going through the apartment.  Yeah, and I got rid of at least 100 CDs, at least.  I got rid of about 10 to 20 DVDs that I just know I'll never watch.  What did you get rid of as far as DVD goes? 
[00:42:30]  Just give me a movie.  Um, like, uh, the Brady Bunch Christmas special.  All right.  Stuff like that.  Just dump stuff we've collected over the years, you know?  Yeah.  And, uh, and I was, like, trying to figure out, you know, do I give the clothes to the  homeless?  And where do you find one of those Goodwill boxes in the middle of Manhattan?  They don't really put those out as much as they used to.  I have no idea where you would take your...  It's a Salvation Army, uh...  Like where, though?  Like 46th there.  Oh, all right.  So I have to pack up the car with all that stuff? 
[00:43:00]  Perish the thoughts.  Hell no.  So I came up with this idea, and I wish I videotaped it.  I just started throwing the clothes out on the railing in front of my apartment, and thinking  there's no way people are going to grab the clothes, or maybe they will, but it's going  to take a long time.  I am telling you, within minutes of throwing anything out on my sidewalk, it was gone.  It's old shirts with, like, pit stains.  It's jeans that just horrific things have happened in these jeans. 
[00:43:30]  That's in, though.  Huh?  That stuff is in.  Yeah, I guess.  And then CDs that are half broken.  The cases are broken.  Some CDs I didn't even have the cases for anymore, and I just piled up out there.  And people were going by and rummaging through my shit.  They took every single thing that I left outside my apartment, including the toaster that doesn't  work.  Why would anyone take a toaster that's out in the street?  Dude, first of all, yeah, it's just disgusting.  And you know it's not going to work. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, you're going to put your bread in there, and it's been on the streets of Manhattan.  It's my new favorite hobby, though.  Now I just walk around my apartment, and I try to find stuff I don't want anymore that  is kind of junky, and I just throw it out there, and then I peek through the blinds  and watch how long it takes for it to go away.  And it's unbelievable how fast.  People will just take anything that's laying around on the streets.  I mean, doesn't the average man of New York, anything I see on the street, I just think  automatically it's been jizzed on.  Yeah.  And I'm not touching.  Give me a $100 bill sitting there.  Nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah.  Disgusting.  Oh, my God. 
[00:44:30]  Old Christmas presents I never used or opened.  Just whatever I can find.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so we started looking around the studio, and we found five items, five items that we  don't want anymore, or never wanted, I should say, because now I'm looking at this list.  Yeah.  We have these five items, Teen Lust DVD of Fine Porn.  That's porno.  Now, why wouldn't we want that?  We have about 20 copies. 
[00:45:00]  I know.  Everyone took one home.  There you go.  There's a couple left over.  Then we have the Guys Gone Wild DVD.  See, this is a great idea.  It's just like Girls Gone Wild.  Right.  Only it's guys.  Only it has lots and lots of cars.  What money-making potential there?  They take the dicks out and start slinging them around.  Yeah.  College guys are kissing each other.  Yeah, that's going to sell.  Who came up with that idea?  Just because, like, chicks, college girls making out and showing their tits sells like fucking 
[00:45:30]  gangbusters.  Yeah, we'll just do it the other way with guys.  You know it's just gay men buying this product.  I got a great idea, but no one will take my phone calls yet.  Uh-oh.  Tards Gone Wild.  Tards.  Gone Wild.  Tards.  Tards.  Now, I guess this would feature retarded people.  Just doing what they do best.  And what would they be doing?  Just doing what they do best.  Just like... 
[00:46:00]  But they're always going wild.  Well, they are, really.  Truly.  Just like walking and throwing a fit.  Yeah, pitch this to us.  Well, one of my dreams is...  What is it?  One of my dreams is to see Tards have sex.  It's one of my wacky dreams.  And it doesn't work when it's actors playing retards?  No, no.  Like the other sister?  It's got to be the real thing.  When it was, uh...  Yeah, I just want to see Tards having, like, monkey sex.  Retards having sex in the movies?  No.  Real retards. 
[00:46:30]  Boy, I have never seen a retarded porno.  Retard porn.  Is that illegal?  There probably would be a market for it.  I don't know.  Some exploitation thing, I bet you.  Did we find a...  If they're of age...  Did we find a loophole in the porn industry?  Get it.  Steve will be on it.  Why don't you call the police station right now and just ask that question?  Just to hear the...  Listen, I'm going to shoot a video.  It's illegal, um...  To have two retarded people have sex.  They're both consenting.  They're both over 18.  We're about ready to videotape this.  We were just wondering. 
[00:47:00]  The set's here.  Everything's done.  They've stopped drooling for the time being.  We really want to shoot this thing.  Where's Steve?  Steve would know.  Steve C. would know.  He is the porno expert.  We'll find everything about pornography.  So anyway, just to get back to this as we get Steve, we've got these five items.  The Teen Lust DVD.  We have the Guys Gone Wild DVD that we got off Jim Norton's desk, by the way.  Here's Steve.  Oh, there he comes.  You hear the retard with the fluffer in the background?  Don't do that yet. 
[00:47:30]  We're still trying to get clearance.  Steve, what do you know on tarred porno?  I don't...  I know that there have been titles that have been made that advertise themselves as being  retard porn, but I'm trying to determine whether or not they're real.  I personally don't think they're real.  Now, if you just get, like, mental disorder porno, people could fake it.  Yeah.  You need what we're talking about really here.  Swollen tongue, retard porno.  Is Down syndrome pornography.  Is the good old DS.  I think there would be an issue with the consent, because, you know, you could always argue 
[00:48:00]  consent for some, you know, that you didn't get it from somebody who wasn't necessarily  all there mentally.  Here's what I believe, just kind of running it through my head for a very short time.  I think people with Down syndrome, obviously, many of them have to live with their parents  for their entire lives.  Sure.  So, you can't, like, just approach them and, you know, get them away and get them on a  set to do porno without their parents.  So, we need to draft up some sort of permission slip.  Right.  It's got to be a permission slip that the parents can sign.  Unless you could infiltrate one of those assisted living communities and then, you know. 
[00:48:30]  There you go.  Now, we need some maybe that are a little more handicapable, as I can say.  Steve, you came up with that a little too easily.  I'm always thinking about these.  Steve, the problem solver.  Yeah, I really am.  All right.  I think it's all about the hidden camera.  Go.  It's all about the hidden camera.  Now, you're in some serious trouble.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Set up a play date.  Steve, our porn expert.  A play date.  There he goes, Anthony.  There goes Steve.  Steve is almost out of the studio. 
[00:49:00]  He's looking for his keys.  And there he goes.  There he goes.  Yeah.  Can you tell when a bit's like glaring thin and almost done?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When I'll almost have five more open spots on my instant replay here?  I was thinking about that.  We need to update these puppies.  All right.  So, then we got the Guys Gone Wild DVD that we got off Jim Norton's desk.  Jim will be back a week from today.  So, I don't think he'll be missing that anytime soon.  We also have a copy of Black Tail Magazine.  Black Tail. 
[00:49:30]  Black Tail.  This is all just black women.  Naked.  Yes.  With big old...  Big asses.  Booties.  Big booty.  I don't know.  Do we have that with us?  Yeah.  Do you have that?  I'd like to see that.  Oh, Jesus.  Thumb through that.  They've already photoshopped Patrice's head.  Oh, God.  On the box of Gorilla Munch cereal.  This bastard.  I'm sure if you scroll through there, there's probably a few of you and you're...  Yeah, great.  Lean on me.  Yeah, I'm sure.  The photoshopped people. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, they photoshopped me?  You bastards.  Told you.  All right.  Anyway, we also have the Mighty Kong gigantic veiny dildo.  I didn't even know we had that.  Oh, and we went with this?  I thought we were going with something else besides...  I thought we had a fifth item.  Yeah, we do.  The t-shirt.  Batman Lives.  Uh, Bat Boy Lives.  Bat Boy Lives.  It's the weekly world news picture of Bat Boy.  Let me see something. 
[00:50:30]  Uh, Nathaniel.  Do you have the Bat Boy Lives t-shirt?  Yes.  Did I put the wrong thing on the list?  Yeah, we don't want the Esteban Ramirez CD, Fly With Me.  Okay, fine.  Esteban.  Esteban.  You see his infomercials at night for his guitar and guitar learning book?  And a Bat Boy Lives t-shirt.  I've seen Peter Brady.  He's doing workouts.  He's hawking that, uh, that lounge chair that moves.  That's all it is. 
[00:51:00]  That ab thing.  Yeah, yeah.  And it really works.  Whew.  All right.  Oh, that collapsible lawn furniture.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Guys, let's, uh, let's do this right away before...  Are we ready there, Mars?  Yes.  All right, what do we do?  Just move over?  Yes.  Oh, we got to move?  Yeah, we want to check this out.  All right.  We'll explain what's happening in a second.  You move, uh...  Oh, we got mics.  Okay.  And we have headphones, too?  Right away.  Wow.  My mic.  All right, are we mic'd?  Oh, this is so weird.  It's the first time we've ventured out of the studio to do anything. 
[00:51:30]  Live on the air.  Uh, there's your mic.  Oh, this is...  Jesus Christ, why do I get the, uh, there's a hurricane?  You get the old wire.  Look.  Ladies and gentlemen, and all your ships at sea.  There's a hurricane coming.  All right, we have loose-lipped, six ships.  What the hell is that?  Can you get a fuck...  What?  Yeah, here.  Anthony, throw the headphones on.  You're going to need those.  All right.  All the ships at sea.  Do I get the headphones with the fucking antenna coming out of the side?  I don't even think you get headphones, Bill, unfortunately.  We're here on the floor of the Democratic National Convention. 
[00:52:00]  All right, here's the deal.  We're outside the studio.  Yeah.  Looking at the cubicles, which, uh, are still here.  Yeah, one of those things is going to be gone.  That's wonderful.  It's going to be gone.  All right, uh, Nathaniel.  Yes.  All right, so Nathaniel's on the streets of New York.  Here's the deal.  Thank you.  I'm going to test my theory.  Like I was talking about a few minutes ago in the studio, Anthony.  Oh, Anthony's got the bullhorn.  Why is Danny standing out there like a state trooper?  Uh, no, he...  We got spotters and everything, dude.  We set up this bit all morning.  Yeah.  So basically, just like my apartment, how I noticed you throw anything on the street, 
[00:52:30]  people will pick it up.  We have chosen these five items that we don't want anymore from, uh, from, uh, our office.  Yes.  Where is it?  All right, Nathaniel.  Oh, he's down there.  Why don't you start spreading the items out on the sidewalk?  Hey, do we have a, uh, stopwatch?  I want to see how long it takes to get these items, uh...  Stopwatch?  Uh, all right, here we go.  So the items that are going to be on the sidewalk, and we just got people on their way to work.  We're going to see who picks up what, okay?  I'm looking at, uh, uh, there's a lovely young lady walking down the sidewalk there. 
[00:53:00]  Right.  A gentleman, uh, smoking a cigarette.  Right.  Another woman with a shopping bag and a cup of Joe.  Right.  Walking down the sidewalk.  Uh, just your ordinary, going to work kind of people.  Right, and we got Danny out there as a spotter, and Nathaniel on the cell phone.  The five items, once again, you guys ready to spread them around?  Yeah, do you have a particular order you want, or just you want all five?  No, just, just throw them around.  We're going to spread them out, uh, about a half a block.  Maybe all the items at once?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Because then, you know, we're going to see who picks up what.  The five items, once again, is the Teen Lust DVD, the Guys Gone Wild DVD, the Blacktail Magazine.  We also have Mighty Kong, the gigantic veiny dildo.  And last but not least, the Batboy Blitz t-shirt.  I'm lucky so he's going to grab that and the video.  That's a two for one.  And we're high atop, uh...  Afternoon of cock.  They gave me headphones with, like, one sides working.  You guys are really sending a message to me right here. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, Bill.  Oh, wait.  I'm not feeling it, man.  All right, the Blacktail Magazine is down, right?  I see it over there.  Okay.  That's a DVD.  That's a DVD?  Where?  Well, tell Danny to stop fucking staring at it.  He's, like, two feet away from it.  Oh, right there on the side.  It's kind of close to the wall.  Yeah, both of you guys need to, like, walk away.  Yeah, definitely.  You're, like, hovering over it.  Well, I'm trying to see...  There's a black man right there.  He's checking it out.  Black guy's checking it out.  All right, what DVD's down there?  Is that the, uh...  That's the Teen one.  All right, the Teen Lust DVD.  Oh, here comes a rabbi. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  They love black chick.  There's a big, fat guy.  They love black chick.  Pick it up.  Pick it up.  With a...  Murray!  ...a yarmulke on.  Didn't even notice it.  Didn't notice.  All right.  That a construction guy is coming out of the building.  He didn't notice it yet.  He didn't notice.  An Asian woman walking.  She didn't notice.  Danny has casually put down, what, the other DVD, Nathaniel?  I believe that's the Guys Gone Wild DVD.  All right, so now we got the Guys Gone Wild on the subway grate.  You know what, Phil?  We got the Teen Lust DVD up against the building.  Yes, Anthony.  It's too close to the wall of the building, I think. 
[00:55:00]  Why aren't...  Shouldn't they put it maybe more in the middle?  There are people just missing it completely.  Here comes a woman who probably ate the same cereal as you will be.  Oh, is she going to look?  All right, she...  No.  She walked right by with our Starbucks.  She's not even looking.  I think they need to be in the middle of the sidewalk.  All right, I'll let Danny know.  Yeah, this is the problem with New York.  They don't really look.  Here comes Chris Rock, a black gentleman in a business suit.  That's his brother, Tony.  In a suit.  All right, the Bat Boy Lives t-shirt is down on the sidewalk.  All right, we got... 
[00:55:30]  Oh, there's a guy checking out the Bat Boy Lives t-shirt, but he passed it by, Anthony.  All right, Danny is now putting the...  His...  I'm going to tell you right now.  Perfect.  I say the t-shirt goes first.  Oh, yeah.  We were supposed to bet on this.  You think the t-shirt...  Well...  There could be a cock on that t-shirt.  Nothing people like better than a free t-shirt.  This guy's got like two huge bags of them.  This would be easy to pick up for him and stuff away without embarrassment.  All right, good.  Now I'll hide him through the middle of the sidewalk.  Now it's in the middle of the sidewalk.  Very good.  What's that one, the DVD? 
[00:56:00]  That's in the middle of the sidewalk.  Is that the teen one or the...  That is the Guys Gone Wild DVD.  Guys Gone Wild.  Nathaniel's like Joe New Yorker on a cell phone.  He's going to step on it like...  All right.  He just missed it.  I don't think the t-shirt's going to go, though.  Who would want a t-shirt?  That just ruined his morning jerk-off.  This guy with a huge backpack.  All right.  Ready for a subway bombing.  He's going to walk right...  He almost stepped on the Bat Boy Lives t-shirt.  Oh, that's the black-tailed magazine.  See, I didn't know it.  Look, you can't put it against the door. 
[00:56:30]  It looks like it's being delivered there as mail.  Yeah.  Nathaniel, make sure all the items are right in the middle of the sidewalk.  All right.  All right.  This woman's passing the Guys Gone Wild.  Oh, she's staring at the blonde.  Take a look.  The blonde take a look.  She definitely took...  Here comes another guy, and he's looking at it out of the corner of his eye.  All right.  We're getting some action now.  It's like fishing.  Yeah.  Now that the guys are on the sidewalk, we're getting some action.  The girl just looked at the Bat Boy Lives t-shirt with the horrendous 80s hair. 
[00:57:00]  Now, this will be uncomfortable.  Come on.  Look at it.  Look at it.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  She goes.  She just looked.  She saw what it was.  Wow.  She slowed down.  She wants to turn around and get it so bad, but she's with a gentleman.  She won't bring it up to her gentleman friend.  That's a little embarrassing.  When are we dumping the dildo down?  The dildo.  All right.  This guy, is he going to look?  No.  Not even a glance at the gay porno.  All right.  What's going to be the first item that they pick up?  All right.  This is a young couple.  They might be curious.  You know what I think the problem is?  There's too few people down there.  You know what I mean?  It's just too wide open. 
[00:57:30]  Sparse.  We got action, though.  It's a constant flow.  Look at this terrorist.  All right.  He's got to pick something up.  Nathaniel, tell him to drop the dildo.  Is that a pimp walk, or did he twist his ankle?  I think he...  Oh!  Oh!  We had a guy kick.  Oh, the guy kicked it.  The guy kicked the Guys Gone Wild.  Guys Gone Wild DVD was kicked.  He's looking at the bad boy's shirt.  Oh, this guy.  Look at this child molester-looking dude here.  He's going to kick it.  Oh!  He's kicking it.  Is that Fred Rutherford?  All right.  Nathaniel, get the rest of the items down there, man. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  They're all on the sidewalk?  Oh, wait.  The guy's coming out of the director's guild.  He's going to look now.  Oh, he's got it.  He wants it.  You're having the bad boy.  Yeah!  Oh, bad boy's shirt.  Bad boy's shirt.  You cheap fuck!  Okay, enjoy the shirt, you cheap bastard.  Get him.  Get him.  Go ahead.  He's back.  The bad boy lives t-shirt.  What?  You can't afford clothing?  You can't afford your own clothes?  What the hell is that?  Oh, the guy's...  Oh, he just grabbed his balls. 
[00:58:30]  You're picking up garbage clothes off the street.  Yeah, pick it up again, you cheap fuck!  Pick it up.  You took it once.  Don't leave it now like you didn't want it.  All right.  Now he ripped it.  Now he ripped it up.  All right.  Why did you rip it?  You know you wanted it.  You cheap bastard.  What's the matter?  Your wife doesn't give you an allowance for clothes?  He's all pissed off.  This guy is so pissed off.  He just stepped on the shirt and ripped it.  He really wanted the bad boy lives t-shirt, but then Anthony called him out, and then 
[00:59:00]  he had to rip it up in front of us.  He was grabbing his balls and telling you to go fuck yourself.  Go tell your wife you need money for a shirt, you cheap bastard.  All right, Anthony.  Too much attention right now.  Very good.  All right.  Well, it's okay.  But it's New York.  It clears in a second.  Officially...  You look like that dude.  What's that dude in Scarface?  Don't fuck me, Tony.  Don't you ever fuck me, Tony.  Officially, the bad boy lives t-shirt went first.  Yep.  Nathaniel, what's going on down there?  I called it, man.  I called it. 
[00:59:30]  Danny's just trying to think of the perfect placement for the A-bomb of items here.  Oh, the big dildo.  Yeah.  Where's the Black Tail magazine, by the way?  Wait a minute.  Here comes a group of guys.  Someone's going to pick it up.  The Black Tail's been reacquired, so he can put it somewhere better.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  Here we go.  You want it?  You want it?  He's looking at it.  Oh, he's looking.  Oh, two older gentlemen kind of glanced down and...  Now they feel awkward together.  Yeah.  They just glanced down at the Girl's Gone Wild DVD.  Guy on the cover of that?  All right.  Well, now we got a guy and a girl. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Oh, this guy's going to grab something.  Definitely.  Definitely.  No.  Ah!  All right.  Boy, he really looked like he was going right toward it.  They both walked by the Teen Lust DVD and the Guys Gone Wild DVD.  I'm feeling a little like Geraldo right now.  Yeah.  There's going to be something.  Something's going to happen.  Nothing.  That gay couple right there is definitely going to pick it.  Oh, no.  That's Danny and Danny.  Shit.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, look at this guy.  Nice.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Oh, my God.  A guy just picked up the Guys Gone Wild DVD. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, you didn't like the gay porno?  What's the matter, sir?  Didn't like the Guys Gone Wild?  Back it up, my boy.  He picked it up.  He picked it up and put it in a phone booth.  Well, he noticed that he was had and all of a sudden he was making believe,  oh, I'm just cleaning up the streets of New York.  And then dumped it off at one of the bus stop things or whatever it's called.  I thought, you know, you've got to defend that guy.  He thought it was regular porn. 
[01:01:00]  He walked three steps with it.  Did it register?  That's what it was?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was the...  Thank God that phone booth was there for us.  Parade of cock and no vagina.  Takes a minute, you know?  All right, Danny.  Get Danny to get the Guys Gone Wild DVD and throw it back out for the offering.  All right.  Who the hell uses a pay phone now?  There are a couple of guys that are coming back out from where that guy took the shirt  and went in all pissed.  I don't want them grabbing all the shit.  All right, Anthony. 
[01:01:30]  Danny's trying to drop the dildo, but he's very nervous to drop the dildo onto the sidewalk.  He's itching his head.  He's on the walkie-talkie.  I got a good one.  Where the hell is it?  Where is the dildo?  He hasn't dropped it yet.  He's also got to pick up...  No, no.  Now he's going to get the...  Danny's going to drop it.  The gay porn from the phone booth.  Is Danny going to drop the dildo?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you were saying fan, because he doesn't have a bag.  Oh, well.  Hey, where's the dildo?  Oh!  It's up his age. 
[01:02:00]  All right.  Now, where's Danny?  See, there's more people hanging out in front.  All right.  Well, because we were yelling and screaming at him.  Yeah, but you have to.  The guy picked up gay porno.  They still have no idea what we're really doing.  We're just kind of controlling the sidewalk right now.  Nathaniel, what's going on down there?  Where's the Black Tail magazine?  He still hasn't thrown that down?  Oh, that guy just checked it out with a book bag.  He did, but then he picked it back up.  Do you want me to just, you know, light a fire under Danny?  Yeah, what is he doing?  Why is he taking so long? 
[01:02:30]  I think he's...  Oh.  He's stuffing stuff into his jacket.  I believe the A-bomb is just going to drop out of his jacket.  Oh, I gotcha.  See, the thing about Manhattan...  He pulled it onto it.  Look at it.  You can tell you've got to drop it.  It's in his jacket, and now he's going to put his jacket down like he's tying his shoe.  Oh, okay, he's doing the old tie-the-shoe scam.  Oh, the guy's watching him.  Yeah, yeah, there's some guy watching him.  Maybe...  Oh, no, they're sweeping up the...  Oh, he's sweeping up the porno.  Oh, he's destroying the...  Oh, you're angry.  Sweep it up. 
[01:03:00]  Don't break it so you can take it home later.  Sir, you're 63.  You're not scaring anybody.  This guy just came out of the...  Hey, how many days a week do you dye your hair, you old fuck?  Hey, tell me exactly where it went wrong that you're sweeping a sidewalk at your age.  When did it go wrong for you, sir?  Look at you in your janitor pants.  Get a real job!  We might need a venue.  Did any of those keys open the one to your dreams? 
[01:03:30]  Oh, are you calling me down, you little fucking brood?  He's telling us to go down.  He wants you to go down there.  Nathaniel, he's calling you out.  Go that way.  All right.  Because this guy's going to be a problem.  We've still got two great items.  Yeah.  He jumped up and down.  He's a great villain for the show, the Bit Wrecker.  The Bit Wrecker.  There he is.  Look at him.  He jumped up and...  Get a picture of that guy.  He jumped up and down on the Teen Lust DVD.  Yeah, don't forget the cigarette butts, you piece of shit! 
[01:04:00]  The guy is outside his building, sweeping up.  He wrecked our bit.  Bit Wrecker.  Bit Wrecker.  All right.  We've moved on to another...  Another area.  Another area, the sidewalk.  Hey, you missed a spot, loser!  The guy's just trying to...  Keep sweeping!  Yeah, that Christmas bonus will be huge this year! 
[01:04:30]  Oh, that's right.  You don't get one.  What's that?  You want to suck my watch?  Yell louder!  Oh, that guy hates you.  Oh, is he pissed.  That guy is pissed.  He's calling you guys down to the sidewalk and everything.  It's easy to taunt from five floors up.  Now he's trying to ignore us.  Now that we see his real job.  Right.  All right.  Well, we have moved on to another sidewalk.  Look, Danny has dropped the...  Blacktail magazine?  No, this is the giant dildo.  Oh, wow.  Look at that. 
[01:05:00]  That's the giant dildo.  You can tell that's a giant dildo from up here.  There's a huge dildo.  That is a dildo.  And a black guy's coming by.  It's called the Mighty Kong Gigantic Veiny Dildo.  That's exactly what it says on the cover.  The black guy's looking at it.  All right.  We've got a guy in a business suit with the Starbucks coffee.  He hasn't seen it yet.  Thank you.  Drop the Blacktail magazine, too.  Oh, is that great?  That thing is hideous.  It's huge.  We're down to, what, two items?  The Bat Boy Lives t-shirt was picked up. 
[01:05:30]  That's scarier than a rat.  You think this guy might pick it up?  No, he's looking at it.  He's looking at it.  All right.  That guy just gave it a little look.  All right.  We're getting some action now.  Black chick.  Little white chick.  Black chick's going to kick it.  Some white cack.  All right.  Totally missed it.  Oh, this guy might be able to use it.  Stanton Moore.  Oh, my God.  Most people are walking practically right over the damn thing.  This guy's got to see it.  He's looking down at his phone.  He's going to trip over it.  Let's kick it.  All right.  Wow.  Amazing how many people don't even notice it.  Most people don't even notice there's a huge dildo on the sidewalk. 
[01:06:00]  Black guy's looking at it with the iPod.  All right.  Now, this guy, what the hell is he?  Nathaniel, where's the Blacktail magazine?  He's in a blue little suit.  It's coming.  Okay.  Well, hurry up.  Nobody's going to pick that up, man.  You don't think anyone without this woman in the pink pants.  How do you suddenly pick it up?  It's huge.  She's going to see it.  Look at her.  Look at her.  She gave it a quick glance.  Didn't want to make like she was looking at it.  No.  And there goes our own Danny. 
[01:06:30]  All right, Danny.  Make him believe he's Joe.  Is he whistling?  He's whistling.  He really is.  Happy tune.  The magazine has been dropped.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Now we've got the Blacktail magazine on the sidewalk and the gigantic veiny dildo, the Mighty Kong.  Mighty Kong.  Here comes an Asian gentleman.  Weeping up.  Fuck Sosa and fuck the fucking dears, brothers.  Don't get high on your own supply.  All right.  We're back. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, Frank, you know what a hot play is?  It's a pig that don't fly straight.  Oh, the black chick checked out the dildo.  We're getting just a few glances here and there so far.  He probably had a bigger cock last night.  All right.  We got a sweepy.  And we got the guy still sweeping the sidewalk over there who just wants to kill Anthony.  Yeah, he is not happy.  All right.  We got a guy checking out Blacktail. 
[01:07:30]  No.  All right.  Oh, oh.  This guy's going to trip over it.  I fell on it and it went up my ass.  That would be a hell of a lawsuit.  Can you imagine?  Tripped on a dildo.  All right.  We got two things left here.  We also have, uh, we recovered the guy's gone wild DVD.  Oh, thank goodness.  Oh, really?  Throw that back down, too.  Just throw it right in the...  Hey, which DVD did that guy crush?  Uh, the Teen Lust.  Teen Lust.  Well, why don't you bring him the guy's gone wild?  Maybe that's what he wanted. 
[01:08:00]  Watch him take his anger out on it.  The guy was trying to show us by jumping up and down on a DVD called Teen Lust.  And he did show us.  And he ripped.  What a man.  Oh, got three more walking up to the dildo now.  This guy's giving it a look.  He's giving it a look.  All right.  Great.  Great sweater.  Look.  I see it.  He took a very long look.  He's got a gym bag.  I think he already has one in that gym bag.  No, I think...  You know, you're right, Bill. 
[01:08:30]  I don't think anyone's going to pick that up.  That is just...  People are afraid to even look at it.  All right.  This woman is walking up with a Dwayne Reed bag.  Right.  She could slip that...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, my...  She looks like she was going for the bag.  She's looking at...  She's going to trip off.  She's going to kick it.  Oh.  Damn it.  Should we move it in the middle of the sidewalk even more?  It's pretty middle of the sidewalk there.  You think?  Yeah.  Oh, here comes a couple of old ladies walking right towards it.  Here they go.  Oh, my God. 
[01:09:00]  This woman is...  She's going to step up.  She's going to trip over it.  Oh, my God.  It's right in front of her.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What is it?  She took a really good look and she actually...  I don't remember that.  Wow.  That look was priceless.  The depression wasn't all bad, was it?  Are we filming some of this, by the way?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I hope so.  All right.  Here comes a woman walking down the sidewalk.  Yeah.  She's got a little green jacket on.  Very smart looking. 
[01:09:30]  She's got a bead on it.  Let's go down the street and talk to Nathaniel for a second, Anthony.  I'm picking it up.  Nathaniel, what's going on?  A lot of people are, you know, curious, but they're not biting.  They're not biting?  No.  All right.  We're experimenting here.  Yeah.  We'll make this even better next time.  We're standing at about five minutes on the dildo.  No, we should do with the dildo, Anthony.  What?  Take it out of the wrapper?  No, attach it to a fishing line next time and when someone does go for it, you start 
[01:10:00]  reeling it in.  Reel it in.  You know what's funny about all that shit laying on the sidewalk?  It's almost like there was some sort of illegal porn bus and people just ran, grabbed  what they could and jumped in a van.  All right.  All right.  We got a fat.  Oh, wow.  A really fat woman.  Or that could be Tyra Banks in a fat suit.  We're not sure.  Yeah, don't make fun.  Come on.  You know you need it.  Here she goes now.  She's headed right for it.  I can't make fun.  Come on.  What do you think?  What do you think?  Come on.  What do you think?  She's looking.  Look at it.  She gave it a glance. 
[01:10:30]  She gave it a really good glance.  It got covered up by her bunt.  Maybe the dildo's too big.  No shit.  Maybe the women are intimidated by the size of the thing.  Yeah, maybe the fact we're on the fifth floor and we know what it is.  It's a little too big.  A little Asian couple walking by.  He could use that, I'm sure.  If you could see the veins from up here, maybe the...  Oh, here's a man crossing the street to go get it.  Uh-oh.  He spotted it.  What is this guy?  What is this guy?  Is he like an Indian guy?  Yeah.  Nerd?  He made a beeline right for the porno.  Oh, he's going, wait, right for the magazine.  No, and he passes it. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  And he still made that sound exciting.  And nothing is happening.  Oh, that guy just kicked it.  He kicked the dildo.  Hey, your foots are queer!  Hey, cock kicker!  People are just trying to figure out what the hell's going on.  Oh, sir, now he's mopping.  Now you got it.  Your boss told you to get the mop?  Anthony, that guy's going to start shooting, man. 
[01:11:30]  You can't make fun of what a guy does before.  No, if he had a gun, he'd have used it on himself already.  What are you pointing?  Where are you going to start mopping?  He's pointing at us again.  I think this guy's going to be waiting for us after the show today.  I'm not going to shoot you, Frank.  Hey, Nathaniel.  Hey, Manny, shoot that piece of shit.  Has the guy's gone wild DVD back on the sidewalk?  Yeah.  It's just past the phone booth.  Just past the phone booth.  Oh, all right.  I see it.  Okay.  It's your tree, Frank.  You're sitting in it. 
[01:12:00]  All right, we got an Asian lady just looked at the Black Tail magazine, walked over the  dildo.  The dildo is closer to the middle of the sidewalk now that it's been kicked.  Right.  And, oh, she just gave the porno a little glance.  There you go.  There you go.  Oh, that guy's like, hey, what?  He's got a nice long look.  And now he's looking at this.  Grab it.  Grab it.  Oh, that guy studied all three items.  But no one wants to pick it up.  Never broke his stride.  No one brave enough to pick it up.  All right, what do we got?  You know what? 
[01:12:30]  There has to be some sort of prize here for someone who has the balls to pick that thing  up.  Yeah.  No one's going to, though.  Would you, as a sane human being, pick up a huge dildo that's laying there?  No.  I don't think a trap door would open and you'd be slid into some gay slavery.  Well, it still is.  At least it's still in the packaging.  Now, if it was just out there like it was disposable.  Which we may have to do.  All right, here's another gentleman giving it a look.  He's looking at all three items.  That's what New York's all about, isn't it?  All right, a black lady just stepped on black tail. 
[01:13:00]  All right, now this black couple.  Okay, okay, okay.  All right, come on.  Walking by.  Oh, she just stepped on it.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, she stepped on that buildup.  Wait, wait, wait.  Now they turn around.  Okay, all right, here we go.  Here we go.  All right, she's bending over.  She's standing over it.  She's standing over it.  She's picked it.  She's picked it up.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  She's picked it up.  She's going to take it.  And now the guy just freaked out.  The black lady picked up the mighty Kong gigantic beanie.  All right, and it's time to unload on her.  All right.  What's the matter?  He can't supply that cock you need, honey. 
[01:13:30]  You like that white cock you sell out?  What are you going to do with that, sweetheart?  Yeah?  Where?  Which way?  No, I was a kid on the street now.  Can't be old.  Oh, my God.  Unapologetically.  She's walking up the sidewalk proud to be the new owner of the mighty Kong gigantic beanie  dildo.  She did.  I never would have thought that happened.  She took it.  She's not even hiding in her.  Fan, go talk to her.  She's not even hiding it in her coat or anything. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, that's great.  Wow.  Absolutely.  She picked it up.  Oh, no.  All right.  Oh, no.  Get that forno.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, the kids.  Oh, look at it.  All right.  We almost had disaster.  There's kids walking down the sidewalk.  A little blonder girl.  Oh, my God.  It's like they're walking through a minefield.  Oh, no.  The magazine.  Oh, no.  They're looking.  Oh, don't look at it.  Oh, she's skipping.  She just skipped right over the black little magazine.  That was close.  Oh, the black lady picking up the dildo.  Classic. 
[01:14:30]  It's exactly what we were looking for.  The sad thing is if Norton was here, he would have been jerking off to that whole scenario.  Hey, bring that mouth out there, champ.  Bring that mop out.  Anthony.  I love that guy.  All right.  You know what he's going to do?  He's going to send a fucking hit squad up here.  Guys, guys, guys.  A guy just picked up the Guys Gone Wild DVD.  He's studying it.  He thought it was regular porn or does he?  He's walking away with it.  Yeah, you like that stuff, don't you, fella? 
[01:15:00]  Guys Gone Wild.  And it looks like...  Where is he?  He's keeping it.  He's keeping it.  He's reading all about it.  Look how he's walking, dude.  What is it?  It's a...  He's very gay.  Is it a black guy?  Yeah.  A black guy just picked up the Guys Gone Wild DVD.  He's keeping it.  He's keeping it.  And we're letting him get away.  What the fuck are we doing?  He threw it in his bag.  It's official.  He's keeping it.  He took it.  And he went back to his Snapple.  And finally, we got the Black Tail Magazine. 
[01:15:30]  Of the three, I would have thought that that would have gone first.  Yeah.  I definitely wouldn't have said the bill.  I just can't pick him the way I used to, you know?  Nah.  Started off the season.  I was up 200 bucks.  I should have quit.  All right.  I guess that's it, guys.  What do you think?  Yeah.  All the great items were picked up.  Yeah.  I think once the giant cock left.  Do you want to yell at the poor guy who has to mop for a living one more time, Anthony?  Ah, no.  Hey, you know something?  It's not the fact that he was mopping.  There are plenty of hardworking, mopping people that I have no problem with at all.  It was the fact that he jumped up and down on the teen porno and ripped the Bat Boy shirt. 
[01:16:00]  That's right.  No reason to do that.  He's an angry, bitter bastard.  All right.  You're an angry, bitter bastard.  I just wanted him to know that.  All right.  I think our experiment worked out quite nicely.  What do you think, guys?  He looks like John Turturro in The Big Lebowski.  He's going to lick that fucking mop handle.  All right.  You guys got to get the video up of the black lady getting the gigantic veiny dildo. 
[01:16:30]  She had no qualms.  Oh, that was classic.  All right.  Nathaniel, thank you so much wherever you are.  He's down there somewhere.  Yeah.  No problem.  All right.  The Blacktail Magazine will have to just kind of sit there for now.  All right.  Just leave it there for some lucky person to find.  All right.  We're going to take a break, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony Show after these messages.  I broke my name, man. 
[01:17:00]  What the fuck?  Fuck!  Hold my hand there.  What the...  Ah, you mother... 
[01:17:30]  Oh, fuck!  Oh, fuck!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, fuck!  Oh!  Oh!  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:18:00]  During the break, the Black Tail magazine also went, Anthony.  Yeah.  All five items are now gone in the hands of some fine New Yorkers.  And someone grabs it up.  I love that new bit.  And one angry janitor.  Oh, man.  The janitor was great.  First time we've tried that bit.  And now we'll hone it and make it ours. 
[01:18:30]  Mold it.  We'll mold it.  Yeah.  It was funny.  The guy thought he was, like, showing us by jumping up and down on the Teen Lust DVD.  I hope we have a video of that because his anger is just amazing.  I just like when he just grabs his fucking...  Yeah, he grabs his...  Dick through his pants and, like, hey.  When was that insulting?  Like, that guy came of age, like, in the late 50s.  Yeah.  He was sick.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:19:00]  Hey, ha!  I was going to say he's singing doo-wop songs with, like, a fire in the fucking...  Yeah.  Grabs his cock.  Take that, Daddy-O.  Blue Moon.  It's like slicking his hair back with his comb.  He was just really pissed...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boom, boom, boom, boom!  Nah, nah.  I plan on being a race car driver, and then I'm going to retire by the time I'm 30.  Mop the floor.  He was just pissed because he really wanted that Bad Boy Lives t-shirt.  And we called him out on it.  And then he couldn't take it. 
[01:19:30]  And he's like, fuck.  Yeah, that's right.  He was taking that in.  Yep.  He was taking it.  He was going to keep it.  He was gone.  He was one step in the building, basically.  And then Anthony heckled him.  And then he had to do something.  Now that he was mad, he couldn't look like a guy that wanted a Batboy shirt off a sidewalk.  So he ripped it in front of us.  And grabbed his dick.  And grabbed his dick.  The video burning Shirley.  You put your thumb under your front tooth, whatever the fuck that means.  Yeah, you take your thumbnail and kind of flick it underneath your front tooth, upper teeth. 
[01:20:00]  That might have been Carmine from Laverne and Shirley.  Carmine Ragusa, the big ragu.  That was the big ragu.  That was the big ragu.  We're going to have to come up with some other items next time.  And I don't want to wait.  I think we should do this bit next week again.  Fucking Fonzie.  That's what happened to the Fonz.  He used to be cool turning on fucking jukeboxes by hitting them.  And now he's mopping, sweeping the sidewalk.  Too old for the Pulaski twins.  Let's go to Big Dick McGee. 
[01:20:30]  Big Dick.  Hey, boys.  What's up?  What up, bro?  Just wanted to tell you, that's the best dick y'all have done since you've been on Exxon.  Oh, look at that.  Bill yelling at that janitor, the funniest shit I have ever heard.  People like it.  I see him becoming a recurring character, janitor guy, anytime you want to yell out the window to him.  Yeah, definitely.  Not as friendly as like when Letterman would do that thing where, you know, he'd look out his window and make a phone call or something.  He's always very cordial.  We want people to just start shooting.  Like this guy's going to one day just fire rounds up at us. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, let's see how mad we can make him.  You need a spotter at the window.  Yeah.  Dude, he's mopping the sidewalk.  And then you just run with the bullhorns.  That is great.  What do you say every morning?  I say next time he comes out, well, tomorrow we just shoot him with water guns.  Super Soaker will make it across the street.  Throw a self-help book at him.  Water balloons from the fifth floor.  Or how about we get, you know, I've watched Jackass many a time and I know there are people that can vomit on cue. 
[01:21:30]  Just to vomit in front of his place so he's got to go out there and mop up and puke.  Oh, wow.  Just get people to puke.  The ideas are endless.  Oh, that poor bastard.  I'm already feeling bad for him.  See?  What happened to me?  That was great.  And then the black lady with the giant white dildo.  That was very, very funny, too.  She picked it up.  No qualms.  We got video.  I don't know.  How long does the video take?  Later today, probably?  Tonight?  Early tonight.  All right.  So later on today, you'll see the video of what we just did. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Up on FoundryMusic.com and OpieAndAnthony.com.  Jinx in New Jersey, what's up?  Hey, me?  Yeah, what's up, Jinx?  I was just listening to Howard because I don't have XM in my car.  Bastard.  And he said that he invented best ofs.  Really?  Yeah, he said nobody did best ofs before me.  I had to save my tape so people could do best ofs.  It's called reruns. 
[01:22:30]  I would love to abuse Howard, but there's a commercial for one of my serials.  Go lean.  On TV right now.  Go lean.  Yeah, it looked like a Kotex commercial.  Right.  All right.  Well, he invented best ofs.  That is it.  What about the...  I'm looking forward to the master list of all the things he invented, so we all know.  What about the rerun?  What about, like, reruns?  That's...  Those are best ofs.  That's what they do. 
[01:23:00]  That guy is amazing.  Have fun, Howie.  Have fun.  How about you do a radio show?  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Sean in Staten Island.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning to you, Sean.  I just must say that was so fucking hilarious, especially when Bill Burr yelled to the janitor,  yo, did his keys open the door to your dreams?  I almost...  I fell over.  Yeah, that was a great block, man.  The bullhorn was a nice touch to the bit, I must say.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  Look at us just patting ourselves on the back. 
[01:23:30]  Well done.  Well done.  Well done.  Good job.  Good job, sir.  We have Francine here.  She came in Friday, but we were too busy.  She's going to do the news for us today.  When is she...  Is she ready?  We don't want to make her wait again.  We got a little Michael Jackson story as we see Francine's ready for the news, Anthony.  This hit the wire today.  Listen to this.  She's ready to go?  All right.  Get her fine black ass in here.  Well, Michael Jackson is relocating to the Middle East, to a part of the world where he 
[01:24:00]  is still famous as the King of Pop.  The Post reports Michael Jackson has bought a piece of property in Bahrain, just a quarter  of an acre, on a man-made island.  Cost?  One and a half million dollars.  He's expected to move in early next year.  And Jackson has pretty much stayed out of the site and out of this country after his acquittal  on child molestation charges.  He bought a quarter of an acre.  A quarter of an acre. 
[01:24:30]  What is a quarter of an acre?  That's not much.  Did you hear all the kids screaming in the background?  It's molesting them.  Whoa.  Isn't a quarter of an acre like the size of the studio?  A quarter of an acre is not very big.  And for a million and a half it costs?  A million and a half.  A million and a half.  But it's his own island.  On a man-made island.  It's like, is it his own island or is it on an island?  It's a man-made island.  I think they have a bunch of things on this thing.  So he has neighbors?  Yeah, I believe so.  That have other like quarter acre plots?  Yeah, he's pretty much going to have to deal with neighbors. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, but they're like neighbors from Bahrain.  This guy can now do anything he wants.  They don't, you think they care what Michael Jackson does on there?  Let me just move to like Thailand.  Yeah.  Yeah, just forget trying to cover it up at all anymore.  Just get it over to Thailand.  Just move there.  Where everybody goes to get young boys and just molest them on TV.  Just have great conversations over there.  That's what I was saying.  What is the big deal?  Just videotape it.  Send it to America that say, here I am having sex with a young boy in a country that's a little more accepting. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  That's it.  He's a free man.  Yeah.  He's got a forsaken the United States of America.  He lives over there now and they'll leave him alone.  Yeah.  And what does he need more than a quarter of an acre for anyway?  A hit album?  Yeah.  Might need one of those.  Might need a hit album to have the money keep coming in.  But what do you need?  You got a quarter of an acre.  You build one big bedroom in it. 
[01:26:00]  A bathroom to put some gay porno and Jesus juice in.  And that's it.  The new Neverland.  Short pants and some loafers and you're good to go.  You're done.  All he needs is a bed.  You're right.  All just a bedroom.  It's going to be one big bedroom.  Right.  With a huge giant bed for the little children.  Oh, he could have got acres and acres of land.  But when all he needs is a bed.  He's not going to have furniture.  He's going to have those big wooden blocks with the letters on the side of them.  Because Neverland was just a ruse to get the kids in there and to make it look like he wasn't doing anything bad. 
[01:26:30]  But that's what all the acreage there and all the rides and the animals and all that shit.  He's boiled it down to the lowest possible thing he needs.  He had a choo-choo train.  Yeah.  He had a train.  This is all shit he needed to get kids in America and stay out of trouble.  Or try to anyway.  Now it's been boiled down.  I won't get in trouble here.  I need a quarter acre and a bed and a phone to order.  That's it.  That's all I need.  It's like Domino's over there.  Three kids for five bucks each. 
[01:27:00]  Any topping, any race you want.  They probably love having him over there.  Why don't you put some mushrooms on his nuts?  They probably just love having him over there.  You know, he's a celebrity.  Hey, we got Kevin from Maryland.  He says he's been there and he can explain what Michael bought himself.  Oh, goody.  Kevin, what's up?  How much?  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Good.  I've actually been to Bahrain.  It's one main island, and then there are a bunch of tiny islands all around it.  I'm sure there are a couple that are man-made, but you probably just got a little red-dink island. 
[01:27:30]  Nothing but sand on it.  It's one big desert over there.  It's right next to Saudi Arabia.  And probably just got a cheap little place over there.  Actually, a lot of rich people are from Bahrain, so $1.5 million is probably just above average.  Yeah, I can't imagine he's getting a lot for his money over there.  No, no, he's not.  I mean, with all the oil tycoons over there and everything like that.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:28:00]  Let's say hi to Nick in D.C.  Nick?  What's up, boys?  Hey, Nick.  I go over to Bahrain every year, and the funny thing about that is the men over there sleep  with women for pleasure, or for reproduction, and men for pleasure.  Don't they have, like, boys?  Yeah.  I mean, the guys are walking around holding hands in public.  Their wives are standing by their side.  I mean, it's real crazy over there.  It's real fucked up.  Yeah.  There's, like, they look at their women like just animals, like dogs that are just there  to make them children. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah.  When I'm over there, they look at them.  I'm an expert.  I got the mic in front of me.  This is what they do over there.  Yeah, it's crazy.  But as far as, like, some sex goes, I've heard there's a lot of DL.  A lot of down low.  We got cops?  What, the cops?  Wait, Mars, get over here.  I don't know.  I've just seen them.  I'm going to go out there and check now.  We have cops?  Lock the doors.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't we have cops?  We didn't do anything.  There's no problem.  We've been in here doing the weather all day.  We're a broadcast facility. 
[01:29:00]  We were broadcasting.  Let's say hi to Steve in New Hampshire.  Steve.  Hey, yeah.  You guys are trying to figure out what a quarter acre is?  Yeah.  It's 104 feet by 104 feet.  104 feet by 104 feet.  That's, like, tiny.  He bought a studio.  All right.  Mars, what's going on?  Yeah.  I guess the cops are inquiring about what happened earlier this morning.  Nothing happened.  Exactly.  Yeah.  What do they want to know?  I don't know.  Destroy that video.  Destroy the video.  What video?  Yeah, there's no video.  There we go. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, there's nothing.  Omerta.  Why is everyone hiding?  Omerta.  Omerta.  Remember.  You say nothing.  You guys, we're working on...  Ben, come here.  What now?  We're working on the rules where the interns and stuff have to throw themselves in front  of us so they can take the hit.  Why is Poe laughing?  Why is Mars in the studio?  The guy across the street called the cops.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  What, the janitor?  Yeah.  What a baby.  Call the police. 
[01:30:00]  Are you kidding?  I knew it.  Where are they?  Try to tell them.  He took it too far.  They're gone?  Yeah.  We can't do that again.  Can't do what?  What happened?  What can't we do?  That guy called the cops.  It's supposedly illegal to do that on the street.  To do what?  Putting his stuff on the street and then yelling at people?  Can't do that.  What?  What stuff?  Oh, we'll do it again.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  We'll do it again.  Remember, now, if this ever happens, let's make a contingency plan here.  Yes.  Has everyone seen Superman 2? 
[01:30:30]  Remember where they break out of the three criminals from Krypton break out of the glass  thing and they go to the White House and ask who the president is and the guy stands  up and he kneels before Zod.  Kneel before Zod.  And it's not the real president.  You getting my drift here?  I got it.  This is what we need to do.  Before any cops really get through those doors, if it really looks serious, a couple  of you guys are going to have to be Opie and Anthony.  Shouldn't we be having to... 
[01:31:00]  I'm sorry.  Two of you guys are going to have to sit by the mics and just take the hit.  Hey, I found my match.  Who?  Bill Burr.  Close enough.  Bill Burr is going to do it.  We'll need a Bill Burr, too.  Close enough.  You can't throw Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  He's not sacrificial.  He'll be the Opie stand-in.  I'm talking...  Just because you looked apart a little bit.  I bet.  More than anyone else around here.  Will Bill be my stand-in?  What?  Bill the intern?  Yeah, Bill the intern.  Bill the intern can be me.  Right.  Which will be crazy.  I'll have like warrants out for me for murder in the jail cell. 
[01:31:30]  Anthony Comey escaped today after killing five people in the jail cell.  When they brought you in, you confessed to like seven other crimes.  You find all kinds of drugs on them.  What do you mean you can't yell at people on a sidewalk?  I say we go...  No, I think another thing is...  Well, thank God they didn't see the thing that wasn't there.  The thing that wasn't there, huh?  Yeah.  It's a good thing they didn't see that.  Now, as far as the legality of this goes, since I do have a microphone... 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  I believe the only real problem here is the bullhorn.  Why?  There's something about amplified voice that is a disturbance that you're not allowed to do it without a permit.  Amplified vulgarity?  Yeah, vulgarity.  Stuff like that.  Although, I don't know if the vulgarity itself is...  Is that something else you haven't really researched?  No, but I have Mike.  Okay.  It's right here.  Look.  Why don't we get real experts on the phone? 
[01:32:30]  I do believe...  We have lawyers in the audience.  It's...  You're allowed to say anything.  We got the NYPD.  They love us.  Once you say it through a bullhorn, it enters a whole other realm, and you're not allowed to do that.  So there's no problem with what is being picked up?  And that, I don't believe, is a problem either.  I know selling it is a problem, but dropping something on the street, that might be...  Yeah.  Is that guy still out there?  Can we call him a baby?  Just really quick, because no one's going to talk.  Baby.  I think the cops are down the street waiting.  Every fucking pussy are you going to call your mom? 
[01:33:00]  This is what I say we do.  We got the video?  Yeah.  I think we got to Photoshop other items into the video.  Oh, like...  So the black lady...  A puggle?  Yeah, the black lady, instead of picking up the gigantic white dildo with the veins called  Mighty Kong, yeah, there's a puggle she's picking up.  A puggle.  It's a garment bag.  I don't know what kind of problem the items are.  We got Billy Mac.  He knows the deal.  Oh!  This segment is called, He Knows the Deal.  Yeah, we know Billy Mac knows the deal.  Billy Mac, how are you doing? 
[01:33:30]  What's up, guys?  Just coming back from Charlotte, North Carolina.  Listening to that bit, it was excellent.  By the way, you just need a sound device permit.  You can get that from the local precinct.  A sound device permit.  That's it.  And then you can open a window and shout down to somebody.  Well, pretty much.  You kind of have to, like, lie a little while you need the sound device.  But, yeah, that's what it looks like.  And what are the rules with certain items being on the sidewalk?  The old sidewalk.  What if there's a dildo on the sidewalk? 
[01:34:00]  There you go.  Well, has it been used?  No, it's wrapped in the package.  Brand spanking new.  Brand new.  Oh, I don't think you put that there, all right?  Well, let's say...  For the sake of argument, we did.  Yeah, would we be able to?  What is the law against putting a dildo on the sidewalk?  I don't think there's any law that says you can't put it there.  You're not selling it, so you don't need a headless permit.  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking as long as you're not selling it,  there's not a problem about porno being sold somewhere or obscenity. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  The janitor might think you're littering, though.  And can we get away with...  All right, it could be a littering problem.  That's like how they got Al Capone.  Al Capone on litteration.  A littering ticket.  Who cares?  That's going to bring down the Opie and Anthony show.  A littering ticket.  Please.  Where's our balls?  Where do they go?  And can we go across the street and punch the janitor in the face?  What would we get for that?  Isn't that what you got, Matt?  Open hand.  We'll slap him.  No, we personally want to do it.  What would happen to us?  Just one good punch to the face. 
[01:35:00]  I think that would be fine.  No, how many thousand?  How many thousand?  Maybe a desk appearance ticket and about 10 grand.  Yeah, you probably got to pay that guy off.  You don't want to do that.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't want to hit him.  I just want to annoy him.  All right.  I want to...  Now it's like a battle.  Now he got the last hit on us.  Yeah.  Sends the cops up.  Anthony, do you really believe he's going to get the last hit?  He's just winning right now.  This is his first win.  He has the ball.  He's got a nice drive going. 
[01:35:30]  Is that guy out there?  You think we're not going to pick it off and take it back for a touchdown?  Is he out there?  I like the puke idea, though.  Let me see.  Yeah, I like the idea of sending people over there to vomit on his sidewalk.  I want people puking in front of his sidewalk.  Is he out there?  No, I see a big wet spot, like, right in front, like where his mop was.  Yeah.  So he was out there.  If I know my mop bucket puddles, about 10 minutes, he's been gone.  Hey, make sure Mars has the mics near the window, because the next time he appears, we're going to run. 
[01:36:00]  And we could yell without the bullhorn.  No problem.  He'll be able to hear us.  Yeah, I don't think there's any law against yelling out a window.  People used to do it all the time.  Right.  Alice, you have a phone call.  Come on.  I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.  They'd be arresting people left and right.  All right, guys, punch it out.  All right, there you go.  The entire past of West Side Story.  You guys, that ends Billy Max, he knows the deal segment.  Everyone wants their own segment on this show.  So, Lawyer Kev is going to add to this. 
[01:36:30]  Lawyer Kev, what's up?  Boy, the scumbag lawyer Kev, how you doing?  Hello.  Hey, Kev.  Listen, they're foolish.  You can put anything on the sidewalk.  You can't use the bullhorn unless you've got a sound permit.  Billy Max, right on that.  Right.  But the sidewalk stuff is just bullshit.  As long as you don't draw a crowd, and then they start saying that it's disorderly conduct,  which is a violation.  It's not even a misdemeanor.  Now, I think there is a problem they could get you for littering.  I mean, possibly for littering, but I mean, that's not even a violation, you know. 
[01:37:00]  But what if you intended to pick it up afterwards?  Like, it's not littering if you put it there just to put it there to attract attention to it.  That's correct.  I would say that has to go to your intent, Anthony.  So, therefore, since you didn't intend to litter, I think you'd be okay.  But now, okay, what about if the box has, like, really rank porno pictures on it?  Well, I mean, again, there's no, you know, thank God for New York City.  There is no, in New York State, there is no law against pornographic pictures being displayed. 
[01:37:30]  I mean, you walk by those newsstands all the time, you'll see a couple...  Yeah.  Do they actually have them right out there where anybody can walk by, look in the newsstands,  newsstands, and see tits?  They might have a tiny, tiny little star over the nip.  Yeah, well, see, that's the thing, though.  The tiny star means something.  No, no, there is, because I remember my little sister came down here to visit,  and I was walking through the village, and I was like, Jesus Christ, you know. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Every other block you went to, there was just something...  Gay porn with a little star over this huge part-on.  Not even that.  I'm just talking about regular good old heterosexual sex.  Josh from Rochester.  Josh?  Yo, why don't we call up Howard, because he's done everything,  and ask him what the legality issues are.  Oh, that's a great idea.  That's a good idea.  Look at Howard on the phone.  Call up Howard, since he's probably done this before,  because he's done everything in radio.  Right.  Let's ask him, because he'd know the law.  Oh, Josh, you rock.  Let's say hi to Dan. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, Dan.  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, listen, you've got a few problems, potentially.  Number one, you've got a problem with the possibility of using profanity.  Now, what is the law against profanity?  Well, that's disorderly conduct.  How?  The disorderly...  I've heard...  Hey, dude, is it true?  I've heard disorderly conduct is the rap that is like the universal fucking rap.  It is.  It is.  If you need to get somebody on something, but you don't really have anything, you can always 
[01:39:00]  get them on disorderly.  It is.  And it would have to be witnessed by a police officer.  So that's half the problem, because it is only a violation of somebody.  Right.  So somebody, let's say a guy with a mop, can't tell a cop that somebody was yelling at him  profanity.  Yeah, listen, can I cut to the chase here?  He could.  He could make a complaint.  But you've got a couple other things.  Hold on.  I want to cut to the chase, though.  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead.  The Opie and Anthony show is not worried about disorderly conduct.  I wouldn't be worried.  We'll take that.  No problem.  Wait, wait.  They could take you to jail for that, though. 
[01:39:30]  It'll be worth it.  I don't want to go to jail.  I'll take the rap on disorderly conduct.  I've heard about the baloney.  Anthony will take the rap on littering.  I'll take littering.  All right.  What else have we got to worry about?  I can handle a 15-day rap, anyway.  15-day.  Well, if you continue to go after the guy, then the mop guy, it could be considered harassment.  Harassment.  Harassment?  If you use electronic means, then it could be aggravated harassment, which now you're rising  to the level of a business.  What if we yell to a rolled-up newspaper?  No, that's just harassment. 
[01:40:00]  That's only a 15-day rap, so I wouldn't worry about it.  And the only, what I see as a potential problem is if any kids get a hold of the porno.  They have to be careful about that.  Right.  See, now, what if a kid's walking by and glances down at some pretty graphic porno that's on  the packaging?  They're not going to know what a dildo is.  That could be something like, what, endangering the welfare?  It will now.  Exactly.  Exactly.  That could be a little rough.  I don't want to be a buzzkill, because I thought it was funny myself, but I just want to  give you the story.  Well, we kind of like knowing what the laws are. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, so that way when we break them and get hauled away, at least we're not asking  questions.  Yeah, and you know how much time you're going to have to do.  All right, boys, punch it out.  Thank you, man.  Thank you, sir.  Take care.  I got to tell you.  Oh, I wanted to ask him about the puking.  Is there a law against puking on the sidewalk?  I just figured this all out, man.  The Bill Burr line really hurt that guy.  Oh, yeah.  To the point where he's like, fuck those guys.  The key to your dreams?  Yeah.  Stop it.  I got to call the cops.  I killed him.  See how he's already ratting me up?  He's already anticipating the cops coming up here, and he's saying that I was the guy. 
[01:41:00]  That went right to his soul, man.  That guy did not like that one.  Let's see.  Well, let's say hi to Greg in New Jersey.  Greg?  Hey, fellas.  How are you?  All right.  Listen, I was just thinking, if you guys put porn on the sidewalk, don't you think they  might come after you for some sort of bullshit corruption of a minor, because you can't control  who's walking down the sidewalk?  Yeah, that's what I think.  There'd be something like that.  Well, we had something in place that protected us from that. 
[01:41:30]  All right.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  What?  We have something in place?  We did.  Like a couple of guys that could have snatched it up real quickly.  Hey, kid's coming.  Get it out of there.  Exactly.  They're not taking this bit away from us.  We're going to do it again.  I like this.  We're going to do it again, and we will have the video up on the website.  Can we get Sam Adams to sponsor this?  We'll call it Sex Toys for Sam.  No?  He sort of rings a bell.  You've heard of Son of Sam.  Well, he's bad. 
[01:42:00]  Sex for Sam 2.  Sex for Sam 2.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  Um, yeah.  No!  Um, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up, stupid.  Grab your, uh, mop.  Yeah, I want mop guy.  I want him now.  He is mine.  He will not get away.  He called the cops on us. 
[01:42:30]  What a pussy.  He called the cops on us.  What a pussy.  I have a suggestion, Anthony.  Oh, Francine.  Drive by in your Escalade on a, on a rainy day and splash him.  And splash him.  He wouldn't be out there on a rainy day because it would be raining, so he probably wouldn't  be mopping or sweeping.  Is there an awning?  Why don't you put a, just, just put a t-shirt out there.  No awning.  Just put a t-shirt out there.  Put a t-shirt out like bait.  And then put a, get a puddle, wait for a big puddle.  And then I'll sit there and, and drive through it and splash him. 
[01:43:00]  Let's go to Josh in Brooklyn.  Josh?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You guys are on regular radio.  You break every fucking rule.  You get a guy to get a hummer from a dead monkey.  All of a sudden you get on XM and now you're worried about breaking the rules?  I'm with Josh!  I'm not worried about...  Where did our balls go?  I'm not worried about breaking the rules.  I'm worried about getting arrested for it.  Well...  I'm not built for jail.  There's, there's...  There's, there's getting arrested, then there's getting arrested.  This is like, ah, getting arrested. 
[01:43:30]  Let's look at who we've had arrested.  All right.  Uh, Rick.  Our old producer, Rick.  Mm-hmm.  Who was like a, a monster anyway.  Right.  Like, Rick was very strong.  He's good for jail.  Uh, Jimmy...  Probably took over the prison.  Probably dead.  Took over the cell.  Ran things for a while.  Cigarette concession.  And then, uh, Jimmy Norton.  Okay.  He's been arrested because of this program.  Sure.  Uh, Jimmy looks too crazy to find...  ...fuck with in jail.  He's one of those guys.  And he's not cute enough to the guys to want to have sex with him. 
[01:44:00]  So, Jimmy's fun.  Much to his chagrin.  Yeah.  Much to his chagrin.  Yeah.  A little disappointing for Jimmy, but that's just the way it worked out for him.  Uh, Louis Black.  Louis Black, yes.  Comedian Louis Black was arrested for this program.  Um, he, he just, I don't know.  It's Louis.  What's he gonna do?  He's like the guy that they would go to to get legal advice.  You know, from, you know, how do I get...  Well, what you gotta do is get the lawyer...  Well, and he moves...  And they wouldn't fuck with him.  Yeah, he moves too much. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, they would.  They'd fuck with Louis?  He'd be like that guy in the end of Boogie Nights on his knees, crying.  Ha, ha, ha, you think?  I think Louis would hold up good because he, I don't know, he, he is a little crazy, and  he's kind of knowledgeable.  They might be able to use him for something.  Than just, what, like a Shawshank Redemption?  Yeah, he could do their taxes.  He'd get the boys some suds.  Some, some beers for doing the roof work.  And then, uh, Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark, yes.  Who, you know, by name alone, you just don't fuck with Psycho Mark. 
[01:45:00]  Right.  Me?  I'm done.  I'm done.  Look at me.  I weigh 145 pounds.  Psycho Mark will get stabbed.  If you go in there with a name like Psycho now, it's like...  Psycho Mark.  What, you gotta prove yourself.  Yeah, you think you're crazier than me?  Yeah.  And the Tim Robbins character got raped repeatedly in that movie.  Even in Hollywood, you get raped.  Yeah.  Even in the movies.  Well, see, that's what I don't want.  You go to jail, Opie.  Fine.  You gonna take the rap?  I'll take the rap for stupid littering or disorderly conduct. 
[01:45:30]  That's easy stuff.  Are you willing to get raped for it?  I'll take a ticket.  If it comes in a ticket that the cop writes up, I'll take it.  We can't be pussies.  This is a new bit.  I like.  I like it, too.  We've just begun with it.  We're gonna develop it now.  We just threw the idea around in the office.  All you're doing is figuring out the fucking parameters.  That's all we're doing.  We're not saying we're not gonna do it.  We're just pushing, seeing where it gets.  That's all.  That's all I'm trying to say. 
[01:46:00]  How many times?  This is a think tank right now.  This is a think tank.  Yeah.  Hold on.  By the way, a lot of people, they like to argue, you know, that we were crazier on commercial  radio.  Uh-huh.  Anthony, how many times have the cops been by the XM Studios in the last year?  I know of at least three times.  The one incident we don't talk about.  I think it was three times.  What happened?  One incident.  We can't even talk about it.  We can't even talk about it.  It cannot be spoken about.  Can you speak in, like, metaphors?  We'll give you a few things that happened because of it. 
[01:46:30]  The Jägermeister machine, the frozen Jäger machine was removed from the premises.  Right.  It served frozen Jägermeister.  The closet locked permanently.  The closet locked permanently, and all IDs have to be double-checked, triple-checked,  copied, checked again, and then checked to make sure that girls are 21.  Wow. 
[01:47:00]  And there's a new rule.  Guests of the O.P. and Anthony show should be able to walk back out onto the street.  Right.  By themselves.  Don't fuck the drunk guests was another thing that came out of the...  Norton was in studio.  Don't fuck the underage drunk guests.  It's just like a...  If I could be subtle with this thing.  It's one of the side effects.  Was it an employee?  Was it an intern?  Who did the fucking? 
[01:47:30]  Allegedly.  I don't want to say because he's, you know, 3,000 miles away now, so I don't want to give  away who it might have been.  And we should be a little more responsible and make sure the girls have their clothes  on before they wander back out onto the street.  Right.  Right.  Little things like that.  Jesus Christ.  And you're still on the air?  Yeah.  Fuck it.  Thanks to...  I...  We're just...  A comedian.  Thanks to a fellow comedian.  That's right.  Who the cops recognized and started talking to and kind of got them off the... 
[01:48:00]  I kind of calmed them down a little bit because other women coming to work should never have  to say, is she dead?  Yeah.  Why?  Why is that girl being loaded into an ambulance?  Why are the cops coming in?  Wow.  You know, a radio show should never involve...  When a guest comes in, after the guest leaves, is she going to make it?  Shouldn't be like something. 
[01:48:30]  Listen, it's like, will she be...  Will she live?  Ah!  After all this shit happened, how much more of a broadcast did you have to continue doing?  Was it the end of the show?  It was the end of the show.  Oh, thank God.  And again, I thought it was the end of the show.  You don't...  You listeners have no clue how close you came to losing the O&A show.  Just mere moments into it.  We almost fucked this up so quickly.  Anyway, thank God the safety...  The gates came down and helped us out. 
[01:49:00]  So...  Guests of the O&A show shouldn't walk behind Anthony and try to jump out the window because  they think it's a door.  Right.  Right.  Just things like that, Bill.  Mm-hmm.  They shouldn't be so confused that they mistake that huge window for a glass door.  Choking on vomit shouldn't be something that guests do.  Guests of this program.  It's like hang out, talk, entertain, plug, choke on vomit. 
[01:49:30]  It doesn't...  No.  I'm saying no.  I'm saying no.  You people have no clue how close...  I want to see the video.  You got video of that?  Video.  Video.  They almost...  We don't film anything, Bill.  They almost gave us lobotomies so we would forget about it.  So there would be not even a mental record of what happened that day.  It was back then.  What?  A black thing in front of your face?  Yeah.  Boom.  What's a lobotomy?  A lobotomy.  Yes. 
[01:50:00]  So they remove part of your brain to...  Members of the O.P. and Anthony show and their guests shouldn't go home with their  hands, especially their thumbs, smelling like they were handling fish at the Fulton Fish  Market.  Oh, Jesus.  Which now recently closed.  See, I'm trying to twist this into something more decent.  Moved up to the Bronx.  Yeah.  Okay, I got it.  I got it.  Guests of the O.P. and Anthony show stay at the Mount Sinai Hospital. 
[01:50:30]  That shouldn't be like one of our plugs at the end of the show.  That's right.  All the other talk shows at the end, it's like guests stayed at the Parker Meridian.  The lovely Parker Meridian.  The W.  Oh, the W.O.T.O.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  The Sheridan.  Right.  We don't want to be running a little commercial at the end of the show that all guests stay  at the hospital.  Stay at the hospital.  It was a little touch and go there for a while.  We were...  You people were so close. 
[01:51:00]  Let's just say for now on, the wiffle ball bat has to have a safety feature.  Yes.  Yes.  A safety feature.  No pine tar past the label.  No, no.  Those wiffle ball bats now, they don't just go anywhere these days.  They used to forget about it.  They'd go anywhere.  How come I'm never in studio for that kind of shit?  Lucky you.  Lucky you.  Can you bring in Bob Kelly to be fourth chair? 
[01:51:30]  I want to see some shit like that.  That was...  Yeah, we've had to put some regulations on the bat, on the wiffle bat.  Let's just say, for now on, pushers have to be sober.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  A lot of rules came out of that day.  Yeah.  That we adhere to on a daily basis, Mr. Burr.  Okay.  You know, if a band wants to offer up girls for plugs of their music...  Check ID, check ID, check ID, check ID. 
[01:52:00]  Check ID.  Never, ever, ever take girls' word for it, ever, ever.  No matter how good they look, how willing they are to go into various back rooms with cast members.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Okay.  That's all I'm trying to say.  Put it in a way that you can understand in a code, you know, like we have been.  Kind of dancing around the subject a little here, I understand.  Might be hard to keep track.  He gave Danny props for the way he, the little technique, the old school technique for putting 
[01:52:30]  the dildo on the sidewalk.  Yeah, that was very creepy.  Why was he so nervous to drop the thing?  To tie the shoe.  Because it was an 18 pound milk white dildo with veins in it.  All right.  Where's that audio, Eric?  Ah, Danny comes in to talk and then just gets chased out.  Hey, by the way, if you guys have a really nice digital shot of one of the Opie and Anthony  billboards, I would love it for my personal collection. 
[01:53:00]  I want to frame it.  Because it looks great.  And they're all over the place.  There's one on Exit 63.  Not going in the public gallery?  Your personal collection only?  Yeah, there's one on Exit 63 on Long Island.  Is it right next to the controversial 50 cent billboard?  Yeah, there's no controversy with our billboard, unfortunately.  None.  That would have been a smart thing to do, though.  All right.  Yeah, you're out of shape backs with a mic and a bullhorn.  That's not a bad idea.  All right.  Why don't we play this audio?  We were just talking about Howard and how he said he invented best ofs, Anthony. 
[01:53:30]  That's the latest thing.  Oh, right?  He's on.  I guess, once again, he has no real radio show to do today.  Hit it.  And I didn't bring this up to Joel the other day because I didn't want to confuse the  issue after the suspension.  But I was just like, you know, five years ago.  After the fake suspension.  Fake suspension.  Howard did the oldest trick in radio.  He did a fake suspension to try to get people talking.  And they kind of talked.  It wasn't as big as I even thought it was going to be.  The whole suspension thing.  Because I think the media picked up on the fact that it was a fake suspension. 
[01:54:00]  He took election day off.  And they believe he got suspended for talking about his new gig too much.  But he talks about it all the time anyway.  It's like, why did they pick that one day or instance or anything?  It didn't add up.  It's great because his listeners are slowly but surely, they're on to him.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  They're starting to get on to him.  And all this bullshit.  And I didn't bring this up to Joel the other day because I didn't want to confuse the issue  after the suspension.  But I was just like, you know, five years from now, you won't even care. 
[01:54:30]  You know what I mean?  You just won't even care.  You'll be doing whatever it is you're doing.  Do the nice thing.  Let me just have my tapes.  I mean, what is the big deal?  Okay, so I didn't negotiate it.  Shame on me.  I'm sure five years ago I could have gotten that.  Oh, he can't take his tapes.  See, there's the problem.  Welcome to the club.  Welcome to the club.  You can't have your tapes.  Oh, I didn't negotiate it.  Well, yeah, you didn't.  No, they don't negotiate that shit.  Yeah, they don't.  When you work for a radio company, this is what sucks about this. 
[01:55:00]  We don't own this shit.  No.  We don't own this shit.  Later on, let's say we make a half a billion dollars.  You might be able to approach Infinity and go,  I'd like to buy back some of my stuff.  And, you know, everything's open for negotiation.  So he may eventually get something back,  but he's going to have to pay dearly for it.  Oh, yeah.  $40 million for the collection?  Where did you hear that?  Where did Hawk hear that?  Were you in on the deal?  Early in the audio, he said $40 million.  They wanted for his tapes.  They want $40 million for the collection?  That's for all his tapes?  You know why?  They're going to be able to use that stuff. 
[01:55:30]  See, if I was Infinity Broadcasting,  I would just play the old Howard shows when he was good.  Play it.  Start on tape number one.  Tape number one.  And let it rip for 20 fucking years.  Let it roll.  Just let it roll.  Let it roll.  Do the unedited versions on the internet.  God damn it.  Should I call up Joel and give him this great idea?  Ah, we'll give him this one for free.  That's what you do.  Fuck trying to throw David Lee Roth in there  and Adam Carolla and all these other hacks.  Trust me, they're hacks.  Adam Carolla's going to do it? 
[01:56:00]  They're hacks.  Adam Carolla's doing the West Coast.  He's got two TV shows and a radio show.  He's an artist working man in show business.  Unbelievable, man.  Trust me, within six months,  Joel Hollander will be calling us again.  These guys are hacks and they will not get the job done.  You'll see.  Good luck.  But Joel, this is what you do.  Just run Howard Stern from day one.  Day one.  One show after the other, an unedited version on the internet, it will fucking kill him.  Because the casual, it's not the hardcore fan. 
[01:56:30]  The hardcore fan of any show, including Howard's, they'll subscribe to Sirius.  That's the way it is.  But you make the money and the huge subscriptions on the peripheral listeners,  the new people you bring in.  Everyone knows who Howard is.  They're either going to want him or not.  It's not like anybody's just hearing about him.  You know what I mean?  So it's going to be very hard to get new listeners that haven't heard him before to come on board.  And that's really where you make the huge strides in subscriptions. 
[01:57:00]  Infinity could battle that by just playing his old tapes.  Because the casual listener will just be like,  I'll put on Howard.  He's back here, where he was.  It's old.  It's best of.  It's stuff I remember.  Oh, this was funny.  They'd kill him.  It would kill him.  Yeah.  Good idea.  That's a great idea.  Roll tape.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a still morning program.  I think you and your agent get beat up unnecessarily. 
[01:57:30]  Because who could have seen the whole satellite thing?  Who could have seen?  You had to assume you'd probably be working for the same company if you continued to work.  Yeah.  It's like crazy.  I couldn't have foreseen the FCC being this intrusive in my life.  No way.  And this degrading to me.  But now I'm stuck with, okay, I don't have 20 years of my shows and all my interviews with people.  It really isn't just.  I mean, seriously, this company.  Guess what, Howard?  That means you're going to have to work again.  Yeah.  For once, you're going to have to work again.  You're going to have to be all new stuff. 
[01:58:00]  Let's see if you got it in your pally.  My interviews.  Somebody, do they really need those tapes to make a living?  Come on.  I mean, does Joel need that?  I don't think so.  But they're not for them to use.  They're for you not to use.  Right.  It's just a spike.  But they're not going to use them anywhere.  No, they can't.  They legally can't.  Why?  They can't release them anywhere.  Why?  The company wanted to take the tapes of my show and erase them all because they needed tape.  See, those guys don't have...  That's funny.  Those guys just don't have balls over there. 
[01:58:30]  They needed tape.  I would walk in on Howard Show Live with all his tapes with a big, huge cartoon magnet and  just start erasing shit one after another right in front of his eyes.  You know those magnets that they pick up cars in the junkyard?  Just turn it on.  Howard show one of those big ass fucking magnets and just turn it on right in front of his eyes.  Then you get Howard crying, which is always good. 
[01:59:00]  They needed physical tape.  They didn't want to spend a dollar or two dollars for the tapes, the cassettes.  So this material would have been gone anywhere.  they never thought to save it  so I maintained it  I saved it  I made it available for best of  they didn't want to do best of  I said do it  you can sell it  you can sell it to your sponsors  right even the whole thing  nobody did best of  until I started doing it  you want to archive the material 
[01:59:30]  yeah  ah shut up  oh it is so funny to hear him  actually saying  nobody did before I  because he says it so much  about everything  nobody did it  well there you go Howie  good luck  you're going to actually have to do  a radio show again  because you can't pitch about  the FCC anymore  when you go to satellite right  nope  that's been your excuse  for many years  why you haven't done  a creative radio show  he loves his bosses over there  oh god is that funny 
[02:00:00]  gave him a half a billion dollars  there's really nothing  to bitch about  alright  we got Francine in studio  you ready for the news  Francine  yeah  hi Francine  hello Anthony  hello Opie  you like Anthony  better than me  what about Bill  I said hi  how are you  I love your show  the Chappelle show  was great  oh thank you  oh a way to bring it up  what do you mean  if Dave Chappelle  didn't like  decide to go away  for a while  Bill would still  be doing that show

[02:20:30]  take the pain  this ain't your show  Elias  death  what do you boys  know about death  did the guy ask you  or did he just go  oops  yeah  actually  the last time  it happened  we were in my room  and we ran out of condoms  because I only had one  yeah  and he didn't bring any  so it's too bad for him  so you go the safe route  by having unprotected anal  no  bag this piece of shit  he was rubbing his 
[02:21:00]  whatever  I was turned around  on my back  genie's lamp  I don't know what he was doing  but I guess that's how  he gets off sometimes  he  he was rubbing his  penis on your  on your ass  yeah  and then  all of a sudden  it went poop  and it went in  you shouldn't  use the word poop  maybe when you're talking  about the  the anal sex  you shouldn't use the word poop  wow  so he's rubbing  so he's rubbing  and then all of a sudden  it went  yeah  it just went  it was disgusting  I told him to get out 
[02:21:30]  get out  get out  of there or the house  like  well of my  my butt  yeah  did you say it like  the Ammyville horror  he's like get out  get out  get out  get out  that bad  he told him to get out  did he go like  oh I'm sorry  I really didn't mean to  I thought it was  the other place  yeah I thought he was  going to do it  but  you kind of felt like  he was doing it  was he  was he knocking at the door  a few times 
[02:22:00]  then you realized  you didn't  what  you kind of knew  he was going to do it  so you kind of let him  and then you figured out  you know what  I'm not going to do it  what was going on  where you kind of  he was feeling her out  is what he was doing  that's what I want to ask  what was going on  where you thought  uh oh  here he goes  he's going to go for it  well I was just  I was thinking about nothing  and I was just  laying on my back  the head of his penis  was loitering  around the area  loitering  but you were on your back  you said you were already  on your  mistake he made  he didn't get her  in the mindset  yeah  that's true  you were on your back  or on your  yeah  I'll tell you 
[02:22:30]  yeah I was on my back  mindset for the anal  yeah  you were on your back  how was it  didn't he flip you over there  no I was already on my back  flip her over baby  but you were on your back  and he was doing anal that way  yeah  he was just rubbing his dick there  on  yeah  no but you said  you were on your back  yeah  you're on your back  oh my tummy  oh you're on your tummy  of course  oh my tummy  of course  and he was rubbing  between your cheeks  yeah  yeah  sorry  alright  and then he got a little lower

[02:23:30]  I guess  it was lubed up  pretty good  well  yeah  I guess so  because if he just slid right in  yeah  yeah  what did he use  did he lube it up nice  or did he just  well  did he use some of that prison lube  we just had sex  so he was already  pretty much  whatever  so it was like all  uh  yeah  ready to rock  all loosey goosey  yeah  that's good  could he give you the reach around  what's that  where he plays  well if he's taking care of you  does the little dj move  he's gotta like get his hand around the front 
[02:24:00]  and go tap tap tap tap tap tap  so he'd give you the reach around  well maybe that was his mistake  maybe that was  maybe if he'd have given other  he just put on that face  he just went  that's the blackest I've ever seen you  that was the Oprah applause break  uh  that's right  maybe if he went  take care of business  I think y'all need to get a job  that was the Oprah of ass sex right there  yeah  you tell him child  yeah  you know  he should have like

[02:29:00]  oh basically if he takes  care of you  you'll take care of him  that's fair  length of time  so you gotta kinda  like the guy  you gotta pick around  be in some kind of  relationship  oh I thought she meant  like sexually  no  like lasting long  no no  it's just pretty much  a relationship  length of time  until she got  where she needed to be  you just gotta  take her to  chicken little  nah she looks  more like a  Popeyes girl  Popeyes  I'm talking about  a movie  I'm guessing  you wouldn't do it  after he had slipped  and poop  no 
[02:29:30]  I'm guessing  that guy didn't  get any after that  so how many  how many weeks  into the relationship  before you're on  your knees  hmm  uh  it's not really  weeks  it's um  how many dinners  just like the  wheel of fortune  I'll take the  brass bed frame  for a hundred  how many  about  um  I'll say  if I've been with  a guy for about  three months  three months  three months  then I'll start  thinking about it  thinking about it 
[02:30:00]  oh my god  do you ever have  a guy  with the electric car  we're gonna have  him in 2019  I was thinking  about it  and he's down  on his knees  in the muck  for three months  with you  you're telling me  you get with a guy  right  you guys  you hook up  you're doing your thing  he goes down on you  he's great at it  you're not gonna  reciprocate  nope  you ever have a guy  go down on you  no wonder he puts  it in your ass  he's teaching you a lesson  you don't even know it yet 
[02:30:30]  try to do the carousel  I wouldn't even ask  someone tried to do that one  that's it  he's gonna go down on you  and then try to do the carousel  try to like  go down and then  flip yourself around  yeah  like hey look  I'm taking care of you  let me just run up here  I'll do the  I'll do the  the shimp  run on the floor thing  where he spins around  and get  get the lower end up there  you have a guy try that  yep  and what'd you do  uh  you just keep running  she's running the other way  so they're chasing  balls bouncing off her eyelids

[02:31:30]  he thought it was my tongue  so he's been begging me  forever and ever and ever  to do it  because he's always down there  and I didn't care  so  that's the mistake  he's begging  he was begging for it  and he never got it  why don't you just get one of those  plastic fake mouths  and just lube it up  and keep it under the pillow  when he pulls it again  you just  slap it on there  oh you're so good  take it all  take it all baby  yeah  he never got it 
[02:32:00]  teehee  he really thought  that you were going down on him  he got a cold wet finger  finger  finger  and he thought  he thought he was getting a head  yeah  wow  oh that's wonderful  he just has to take it away from her  that's a god damn stalemate  well he sucked at it anyway  he thought he was great  oh then that's justified  he's not doing the job  now you got a point  he was so-so  did you tell him what he was doing wrong  yeah  maybe I just didn't like him  I don't know  yeah that's what I'm feeling

[02:37:30]  well I got something  on Terrell Owens  but  yeah  yeah T.O  cool  yep  football news  with Francine  sports  Terrell Owens  uh  is selling  his New Jersey  home for  4.4 million dollars  Owens was suspended  uh  last week  for four games  and will be  deactivated  for the rest  of the season  Terrell Owens  is mostly pissed off  because he thinks  he doesn't make  enough money  he has 
[02:38:00]  unsuccessfully  demanded  a seven year  49 million dollar  deal  to be  renegotiated  too bad  that's it  yeah  a little lackluster  today  Francine  I know  the last  of my  were you all  nervous  because you  made fun  of Bill  well you didn't  make fun  of him  but  did that  get you  I'm really  sorry  really  I didn't mean  to  Bill  how many  fucking times  do I gotta say  you don't bring  it up  it's like  I got it 
[02:38:30]  you did  you brought  it up again  you don't even  bring it up  with your apology  actually  okay  that's the best  you could do  in that situation  alright  you got any  football scores  anything like  that  I believe  the Giants  won a game  Giants won  very good  and the Knicks  probably lost  I don't know  if they did  because  I don't think  actually the Knicks  won their first  game of the year  and the Giants  actually lost  to Minnesota  a team they  should have  beat  yesterday  Francine  do you know  anything about  football  they play 
[02:39:00]  with the ball  yeah  now what do  you really know  about football  I played  game day  before  played game  day  alright  so what do  you know  about football  there are so  many women  that don't even  have a clue  what football  is about  it amazes me  I watched  every given  Sunday  and after I  watched that  movie I  understood  how football  works  what about  any given  did you watch  that one too  I don't know  about that one  alright so you  know how football  works  tell us how  football works 
[02:39:30]  every given  she saw that  movie and now  she knows how  football works  so how does  it work  okay well  there are two  teams  oh good  and there are  four times  that you get  the ball  and you have  to make it  past a certain  line  alright and what's  that line called  of  um  the maginal line  the maginal line  and uh  they have a  bill don't help  her  why are you 
[02:40:00]  helping her  you know  I think they're  called innings  you have four  innings  very good  four innings  try to stop  the Nazis  from coming in  that's it  four innings  and you're  going for  the maginal  line  right  yeah  and if you  don't get  it in  four tries  to get  four innings  four innings  use the terminology  uh  you don't  get to go  on to  you have to  move past  a certain  line to  stay getting  the ball  and  and the line  is the  the maginal  line  the maginal  line  very good  and you got  four innings  to get it 
[02:40:30]  past that  maginal line  now if you  get past the  maginal line  in four innings  what happens  now  you get to  keep the  ball  very good  right  now there  there are  intersections  where you can  catch the  ball  intersections  where the  other team  can get  the ball  and they  get to  keep the  ball  how does an  intersection  work  you have to  catch the  ball when the  other team  has the  ball  right  right  oh  what is the  regis and joy  are singing  christmas songs  what about  the  when the  kicker comes  out and  they say  he has  camel toe 
[02:41:00]  what does  that mean  oh yes  that's a  very very  bad thing  for a  kicker  to have  what kind  of injury  is that  when the  kicker  has camel  toe  bad ankle  camel toe  bad toes  so it  has something  to do  with his  foot area  possibly his  toes  camel toe  well then  there's the  touchdown  ah  moving on  the touchdown  you don't 
[02:41:30]  know what  the camel  toe is  it prevented  the bills  from winning  the super  bowl  when they  were in  the super  bowl  with the  giants  camel toe  scott norwood  had camel  toe  really  yeah what  was that  oh not  good enough  toes for  kicking  not good  enough toes  for kicking  it could be  very good  it was frostbite  oh really  yeah  that's kind of  very unfortunate  considering it was  about 75 degrees  that day  all right so  continue so the  four innings  yep you get  past the  marginal line  yep so now 
[02:42:00]  you continue  and you haven't  thrown any  intersections right  right and an  intersection is when  the other team  catches the ball  yep in one of  those innings  that's an  intersection  yes  and when they  get the ball  and then you  have to try to  get the ball  to the other  side where  the other  teams  and if the  kicker has  camel toe  what's wrong  with his toes  he has  bad toes  frostbite  frostbite  frostbite  holy shit  hopeless  all right what's  the goal line  what's that  called  where you have  to get the  football pass  the glass 
[02:42:30]  the score  area  the score  area  score area  and I know  one thing about  it  all right  you have to  have your foot  in at least  one foot in  to get the  touchdown  okay  yeah like you  don't have to  have both feet  in  right very  good  and once  you get  your touchdown  what if  your nutsack  isn't in  the scoring  area  as long as  your foot's  in I believe  you still get  the score  very good  okay  so then  that's six  points  yep  so then  you get a 
[02:43:00]  chance to  either run  the ball in  to get two  points  she knows a  little bit  wow  or you can  kick it  granted you  don't have the  camel toe  through the  H  or Y  or whatever  thingy  the yellow  thingy  well what is  it called  the yellow  thingy  is it called  an H  or is it  called a Y  or is it  called something  else  pick the right  letter  what letter  does it look  like  I think it  looks like a  Y  Y  yeah  alright  is there a  name for  this  yeah  yeah  the goalie 
[02:43:30]  the goalie  the goalie  mm-hmm  well yes  the goalie  very good  the goalie  okay  and it's usually  yellow  usually yellow  sometimes it's not  though right  I think it's  usually yellow  alright  I was trying to  trick you  yeah you're  very good  wow  I'll be  just trying to  throw you off  your off your  game a little  bit  yeah and that  gives you  one point  very good  and there's  another thing  where you can  get two points  mm-hmm  where  oh I forgot  and then there's 
[02:44:00]  another thing where  you could lose  one point too  mm-hmm  today show  or if you catch  the ball in the  other team's  thingy-ma-bob  I forget  other team's  thingy-ma-bob  the goal area  right  the score  the score  place  yeah you can't  get your ball  in that area  because that means  that the other  team gets two  points I think  put it  holy shit  in a rag  oh my god  well I think 
[02:44:30]  she's pretty  pretty good  with her football  knowledge  yeah  very good  anything else  about the  football  um  the football  is in the  shape of what  a ball  a oval ball  a oval  oval ball  mm-hmm  yeah  very good  it's sort of  football shaped  yeah  yeah  all right  put it  what  Bill's very  annoyed  what's wrong  Bill  I don't know  she's like  water torture  you want to  plug that

[03:04:00]  this is 9-11 audio  9-1-1 audio  of a 66 year old  granny just shooting  the prowler and  talking to 9-1-1  at the same time  this rocks  are they still there  okay are they still there  yes  do you know who it is  no hurry  please hurry  okay is anybody  injured  he just saw him  hurry  please hurry 
[03:04:30]  okay stay on the  phone with me  okay  is he sitting down  or is he getting up  he's lying down  he tried to  get him out here  now  or bite  it's on him  i'm going to  tell her  i have police  and i'm paramedics  on the way  okay  she doesn't know  where she shot him  police and i'm  paramedics  are on the way  okay  where are you  coming to my house  you lousy  son of a  it's fun 
[03:05:00]  it's fun to shoot  she lost the shit  you hear that  you stay down  you stay down  or by god  how dare you  break into my house  you son of a  bitch  i'll shoot you  again  listen to the  last bit of it  did you just  shoot him again  tell her to stop  shooting  people are coming  stop shooting  you gotta just  stop shooting  the guy  did you shoot 
[03:05:30]  him again  yeah  tell her to  stop shooting  yeah  we have a  an ending to  that story  of course  we got more  how great is  that 9-1-1  call  fantastic  is that  is that the  best one we've  heard  that's pretty  good  in a while  do we have  our old  9-1-1  calls  the lady  complaining about  not getting her  burger  this is a real  one  we heard the  glass breaking  and searched  the closets  we finally came  down to one  last door  that we had  not opened  and it was  this door 
[03:06:00]  right here  a coat closet  door  i had my  38  i pulled the  door open  and this man  this big  six foot  one  really buff  man jumped  out at me  and i jumped  back  and i held  the gun on  him  and my  granddaughter  called 9-1-1  right here  and i said  get down  get down  or i'll shoot  and he was  trying to grab  my gun  and i was  going like  this to keep  him from  grabbing it  and backing  like this  back and  forth  and he  wouldn't get  down  he started  to open  the front  door  and he 
[03:06:30]  opened the  door  and grabbed  at my gun  and he  didn't get  down  and so i  shot him  and he  came out  here on  the porch  i still  had my  gun on  him though  he fell  down in  these leads  right over  here  and he  i was afraid  he had a  weapon  in his  running pants  he didn't  have a shirt  on  just lots  of tattoos  and i stood  right back  here so he  couldn't hit me  just in case  he did have  a weapon  then i he  got up to  run and i  shot one  more time 
[03:07:00]  and by that  time the  police were  coming  wow  she almost  screwed up  by saying  that he  was leaving  the house  like if  someone breaks  into your  house and  then they  are trying  to retreat  from a  situation  it gets  very iffy  very iffy  sounds like  he's running  away  yeah no  matter what  happens  beforehand  if you  sense that  somebody is  leaving the  situation even  if they  created it  to begin  with if  they're  trying to  retreat  then it  gets really 
[03:07:30]  touchy  with deadly  physical force  you can easily  convince that  you still felt  threatened  right  then her  saying he  was going  for the  door and  grabbed at  my gun  there you  go and  then her  saying she  thought he's  on the ground  and thought he  had a weapon  in his pants  and that he  might have been  going for that  you could shoot  him 20 times  in the back  of the head  at that point  i saw his arm  twitching i  thought he  had a gun  that's all  you need  she's clear  we got a  little more  audio  good job  and the  second shot  that the  911 operator  was talking  that was a 
[03:08:00]  warning shot  right up in  the air  yes and  that's the  one that the  police heard  and i saw  their flashlights  coming down  the street  right after  that  now were you  scared in all  of this  i was scared  i was terrified  and i was  really really  angry that  this guy is  in my house  he could have  harmed me  or my  granddaughter  if i had  not had  that 38  ready to  go  and and you  said you'd  been through  a gun  course  so you  didn't shoot  to kill  you shot  just to 
[03:08:30]  wound  you knew  what you  were doing  i really  did  i had  when you  get a  handgun  you want  to practice  practice  practice  and  actually  they do  tell you  to shoot  for the  chest  area  but  in this  case  i thought  it was  better  just to  let the  police  take care  of the  bad  stuff  i just  shot him  in the  leg  to stop  him  you got  to shoot  for the  big target  that's what  they always  tell you  center mass  because right  when you  are using  deadly  physical  force  when you  have been  forced into  that situation 
[03:09:00]  uh  it's not  about wounding  you got  to commit  all the  way  you got  to commit  it's all  or nothing  there's odds  of missing  right  how's this  old granny  there  just  hey jad  get me  the varmin  gun  i'm gonna  shoot him  in the  leg  that granny  is pretty  good  crack shot  we got  to hear the  audio one  more time  are they still  there  okay are they still there 
[03:09:30]  yes  do you know  who it is  no hurry  please  he just shot him  hurry  please hurry  okay stay on the  phone with me  okay  is he laying down  or is he getting up  he's laying down  he tried to  get him out here  now  her bike's on  and i'll miss  you gotta stop shooting him  you gotta stop shooting him 
[03:10:00]  she's gonna get in trouble  she's gonna get in trouble  because she was like  you son of a  how dare you  come on  i will kill you  that's great  who was hoping for the n-word  through that little thing  i was hoping  you damn son of a bitch  nick  that would have made it  it sounded like it should have  like out of that accent  and everything  like that should have been

[03:24:00]  do you know  although I should be wearing dark ones  I want to know how many times  you put your friggin socks on  and your shoes on  and that bunched up seam  is pressing on your little toe  what in the  see  the white socks  yeah  I love the white  dude I even gave up wearing  dress socks with suits  I couldn't do it anymore  why  what's wrong with the quality  I just  see  you gotta buy a good dress  ah  you're buying cheap stuff  you go with the gold toe  I go with a nice  yes sometimes the gold toe  hey I got a gold toe  what  on your white  gold toe 
[03:24:30]  those are white  with a gold toe  yeah but it's the same company  where's the seam  right across the top of your toes  so  well why did you buy some  fucking shoes that fit  I do  I don't have any problems  with those do you  my shoes  what  I just like a nice sock  the white socks are fine  man what kind of shoes  are you wearing  pure white  I'm just wearing  they're sneakers  alright listen  listen to me  I will tell you this  those socks came with  an oxygen tank  oxygen tank  you idiot  I can't talk  I know  and that was a great line too 
[03:25:00]  it really was  fuck  the jeans I'm wearing  wait let him catch his oxygen  the jeans I'm wearing  I will wear the entire week  the underwear  see that's a problem  you talk about it  like it's no problem  you think if you say it enough  that people won't go  ew  anyone around here  ever smell my ass  exactly  who wants to  exactly  no you don't have to  stick it in someone's face  to smell someone's ass  people walk by  and they're a little funky  you smell it  yeah but for a week 
[03:25:30]  and you roll a blade  that's disgusting  I changed the underwear  and the socks  that's disgusting  and the shirt  you will see  two maybe three times  this week  no  yes you will  no  you know Einstein  wore the same shit  every day  but he had like  yes you will  seven versions of it  he's a genius  he's a genius  unlike you  who's just a filthy man  wow you're just a fancy  homeless guy  you're a homeless guy  with a house  but this shirt  cost me $70  and why did you go down 
[03:26:00]  there that day  it doesn't look like  a $70 shirt  after he had his gay cereal  he wanted to go down there  and look at the models  at Abercrombie and Fitch  you had a real gay weekend  didn't you  I did not want to look  at the models  alright  can we play  the Tyra Banks stuff  yes  she's the friend  of the fat  and now she's a pal  of the stutterers  right  making everybody  feel better about themselves  is what she does  yes she does  let's get right into it  one of my favorite  things I like to do here  is a makeover 
[03:26:30]  for life  and today's stories  will steal your heart  the people you're about  to meet are among  the more than  three million Americans  who suffer  with a stuttering disorder  for some  it's a genetic condition  for others  the cause is unknown  in either case  stuttering has caused  emotional pain  and limited their  everyday lives  now sometimes  there's a misconception  that people who stutter  aren't smart  and I want to say  right now  that is completely  wrong  stuttering is a serious  disorder that is to be  taken seriously 
[03:27:00]  and it has nothing  to do with a lack  of intelligence  now Meredith has dealt  with stuttering  all of her life  and despite countless  treatments  she still struggles  with her stutter  every day  did you notice  when she first said  stutter  she got in her head  and then she actually  stuttered the next line  did she  whatever you do  don't stutter  yeah well  I love how she's  just dramatic  everything's very  dramatic with her  her intros  are very dramatic  I just want you to  know  did you ever really 
[03:27:30]  think that stuttering  people were stupid  that  you did  Opie  yeah okay  sorry  I just never really  thought they were stupid  yeah when I was eight  yeah yeah okay  good  good point  when you're on the  out in the schoolyard  making fun of  your playmates  preach to adults  don't throw rocks  at the retarded  that's what she's doing  yeah  they're not stupid people  the stutterers  oh I gotcha  let's uh  so sick  they all gotta act  like they fucking care  and I said stuff  I was talking earlier  Jessica Simpson 
[03:28:00]  going to Africa now  yeah  and that's like  her feel good moment  I want to care too  how come Angelina  only gets to care  I want to care also  like  Tyra Banks  did she think  people are in the office  buildings in their cubicle  going four eyes  four eyes  you wear glasses  ha ha  she's preaching  to grown ups  like we're children  you know what the reality is  is we are  just when they're not there  we just don't say it  to their face  okay  another good point  Bill  we don't say it  to their face 
[03:28:30]  so do they really  have to know  that that's what  we're saying  about them  stutterers  we're saying  you're stupid  behind your backs  let's see what  let's see what  how is she gonna work  let's see what  murder's all about  I  to  why  speak at  times  and  words just don't 
[03:29:00]  come out  it just has such a huge  impact  happen  everything I do  and every aspect  of my  life  stuttering in front  of anyone  is just so  embarrassing  every time I stutter  it's like I'm  a child again  because 
[03:29:30]  I feel  helpless  I define  who I am  she's doing good here  that's because  they're playing  sympathetic music  stuttering  I know that  I'm so much  more  than  the girl  who stuttered  yeah  we're gonna learn  a little bit today  everybody  yeah  next clip 
[03:30:00]  she could have said  that in eight seconds  Jesus Bill  like he's the bad guy  in this  I know  you said the whole bit  I'm supposed to riff  on whatever you  present there  Mr. Point Guard  and we're playing  every insensitive clip  we can find  he says one word  and Opie jumps on him  Bill finally decides  to join the team  and then we  throw it back at you  we really are  the worst  yeah all that  shit with that 
[03:30:30]  the news girl  yeah I just  I just went along  with it  yeah you didn't  want to either  wanted to apologize  in between breaks  of course you did  here's the next clip  you're a nice guy  I really thought  you guys are  such assholes  he stuttered  now Meredith is 34 years old  and she struggled  with stuttering  her entire life  but she's just been  introduced to an amazing  device called  the fluency master  and it has done wonders  for her to correct  her speech 
[03:31:00]  and I know  Meredith that there's  been something that  you have been wanting  to say your entire life  that has been so  difficult for you  but now with the device  you can say it  so why don't you  stand up and say that  stand up  hi  I'm Meredith  that's it  setting those goals  pretty low  hi I'm Meredith  that's what she wanted  to say her entire life  we're taking  the notion  you know what's funny  this movie stinks 
[03:31:30]  this is how awful  Tyra is to listen  to look at  she's great  I would be watching  the show just to  check her out  watch the person's  bottom lip quiver  but you hear on the  radio it's just  horrendous  horrendous  and she's just  she's trying so hard  to come off as  very sensitive  and loving  and caring  oh that's what  I laughed in the  beginning when she  tried to say  people's problems  she's trying to  have problems  that's what she does  she gets so too bad  if she says you guys  I used to have a  stuttering problem  because she has to 
[03:32:00]  like connect to all  these things now  oh  all the supermodels  I have  no that's my whole  yeah that's her  whole show  is like look  I'm just like you  guys  why don't you  just stand up  and tell everybody  what you wanted  to say so long  he said  I can smell  your cunt  oh my god  what's that  supposed to be  some kind of  sick joke  yeah  well let me  see what she  yeah  waited her whole  life to say 
[03:32:30]  hmm  yeah  let me think  take this over  a little bit  he has rifling  through the shit  stop breaking  down the eighth  wall  let's see  they can hear you  shuffling it  the same way  they hear you  eating your gay  cereal  you shut up  you're ruining  the bit  what did you  want to say  that's what I  do on here  so long  what did you  want to say  oh that uppity  nigger went  and hit me  on the head  with a shovel  why does she  sound like  slim pick  that doesn't 
[03:33:00]  sound like  Meredith  replacing saddles  with that  let's go back  to the audio  this feels great  I'm sorry  I'm just looking  at you going  this is a totally  different woman  so this device  actually has  changed your life  yes  oh yeah  it has changed  your life  and I can imagine  being a beautiful  woman and a guy  approaching you  he's like oh  she's so beautiful  and then it's so  hard for you to  speak and then  they might get  confused and  might be prejudiced  about it  but you know  it's a whole new  day not just  with guys  but just in  general  soon as I 
[03:33:30]  get home  the first thing  I'm going to  do is punch  your mama  in the mouth  alright  now we move  on to James  tell me about  the time  that James  called a girl  that he liked  in school  he called her  at home  he had called  her and  he had asked  to talk to her  he had started  to say her name  because the father  had answered  the phone  and he had  started to say  her name  and he couldn't  quite get it out  and he had  stuttered on  some of the words 
[03:34:00]  and the dad  said is this  a joke  and started  cussing him  out  and my son  was trying  to say  no  no  and  no  and  the dad  hung up  on him  what's that  supposed to be  some kind  of sick joke  you better get  your head  and your ass  wired together  or I will  take a giant 
[03:34:30]  shit on you  now this next  story really  touched me  16 year old  James had a  severe stutter  and his story  stole my heart  I try not to talk  a lot  I feel embarrassed  people think  be  be  who is Mike  Jones
