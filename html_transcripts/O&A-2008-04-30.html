<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on Wednesday, April 30th, 2008, was a chaotic mix of topical discussions, bizarre tangents, and shocking humor, featuring Big A in studio.  The show opened with a discussion of Opie's "Whip Him Out Wednesday" promotion and anecdotes about damage to his cars from "Wow" stickers, transitioning into a comparison of driving new versus old vehicles.  This segued into an extensive review of Grand Theft Auto IV, focusing on its detailed car damage, improved combat, offensive in-game television programming, and the controversy surrounding its depiction of New York City, including the Mayor's disapproval of rewarding points for killing police officers.  Opie's recent purchase of a Walther PPK pistol sparked a conversation about his gun collection, prompting a call from a concerned clinical psychologist. A discussion of a home invasion in Newton, Massachusetts, followed.  The show also touched upon Paula Abdul's perceived blunder on *American Idol*, contrasting their show's style with other morning programs and teasing an upcoming "When bad things happen to good people" segment, including a humorous anecdote about a newspaper carrier finding an elderly woman trapped under her deceased husband.

The show continued with a discussion about *American Idol* rehearsals and judge comments, moving on to sports, specifically Barry Zito's demotion and the Rangers' playoff loss.  Club Soda Kenny provided traffic and weather reports with his signature gruesome accident details and a Farmer's Almanac prediction.  Jimmy Norton promoted his free HBO stand-up show, leading to a discussion about a female radio DJ, Rachel Steele, with suggestive comments later clarified by a listener stating she's married with a child.  The hosts then debated Yankees announcer John Sterling's home run calls, soliciting listener submissions, and commented on an Alabama politician's confusing remarks on raising the alcohol limit for beer, followed by a leprechaun sighting anecdote and a discussion of New York City's high marijuana arrest rate and drug policies, concluding with a salacious lawsuit against a veterinarian.

A segment featured a darkly comedic discussion of fictional scenarios involving a dentist molesting a patient and a man killing and dismembering a prostitute. This was followed by an interview with Jacqueline, facing felony marijuana charges, punctuated by her laughter and nonchalant attitude.  Jim Norton again promoted his HBO show, and a sexually suggestive webcam video was described.  The hosts discussed their low ratings, criticizing "Elvis Duran and his Morning Zoo." A new "phone slam" segment debuted, pranking a caller with a fabricated family death announcement.  An interview with Alabama State Representative Alvin Holmes regarding raising the alcohol content of beer ensued, interspersed with off-topic banter.  The segment further tackled Reverend Wright's controversial statements and Obama's response, with varied opinions on Wright's self-serving actions and church hypocrisy.  This transitioned into a discussion of a man fathering seven children with his captive daughter, concluding with a bizarre song about Hulk Hogan and a hair contest involving a staff member.

Further discussion of Jeremiah Wright and Barack Obama dominated another segment, involving NYC Pete, Miami Craig, and Steve (a regular contributor discussing his back injury). The NAACP's support for Wright, the political ramifications for Obama, and Wright's racially charged rhetoric were debated with offensive language. The conversation shifted to Grand Theft Auto IV's projected success, a review of "Chasing Ghosts," and a break.com video parodying an Opie and Anthony bit ("AJ Poopy Shits"), concluding with a two-year-old singing "Hey Jude."

The final segment opened with a discussion of Tony's perceived lack of commitment.  The hosts then discussed Pat Duffy's eccentric behavior, including coprophagia.  They reacted to YouTube videos featuring a twenty-year-old Asian woman and various other videos, including "Charlie Bit Me" and breastfeeding videos, with highly vulgar and sexually charged commentary. A 911 operator falling asleep was also mentioned. Numerous "line of the day" segments were interspersed, followed by Jim Norton's HBO promotion, and concluded with a video of Pat Duffy brushing his teeth with dog feces.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  We got Big A in studio.  He's got the tongue scraper.  He just scraped down an oyster.  Iraq, get in there for a sniff of that sample.  Opie and Anthony.  Why don't you shut up?  Shut up! Shut up! Shut the f*** up! 
[00:01:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  When you reenact baby diaper mustache and tippy problems on the pants.  Sure. Oh, no, you wouldn't.  It's like the underpants were dyed brown.  All right, open them up.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  And the war continues. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  We are live.  Good morning.  Wednesday, April 30th, 2008.  April 30th already.  Last day of May?  Last day of April.  Last day of May. Wow.  It's June tomorrow.  Oh, God.  Last day of April.  That is a month that flew by. 
[00:02:00]  You think?  Hells yes.  It's also Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  It's a promotion I came up with many years ago.  Back in the late 70s, I believe, when you were a boss jock.  Let it be known, I came up with Wow many years ago.  But I decided to keep it in my back pocket until I met Anthony.  And then decided to break out this wonderful...  Break it out.  ...promotion for the world to see.  Huge promotion. 
[00:02:30]  You sat on it for a while.  Because that's what a radio guy does.  He comes up with something brilliant, and he sits on it for many, many years.  Yeah, radio guys don't just blurt stuff out.  You dope.  Hopefully pull out a bit that works.  I would like to say hi to people I saw with Wow stickers driving in today.  I saw a lot of them today.  Really?  And two of them on big, long dump trucks that haul rocks and sand. 
[00:03:00]  And I just would love to say a thank you for the pummeling that my vehicle's windshield got.  Like I was driving through a sandstorm.  There's got to be something they could do about that.  And then I saw the Wow sticker, and I'm like, oh, great.  Ah, one of ours.  Great, one of ours.  One of ours, destroying cars.  Just getting sandblasted.  There's got to be something they could do.  The worst thing, too, is I can understand, okay, the trucks, whatever.  I don't know what that's all about, that they've got just sand blowing out of their truck. 
[00:03:30]  But the cars that are next to the trucks, could you pass them as quickly as possible?  They sit there and just go, oh, I'm being blasted with sand.  Let me just sit here.  Yeah.  Move!  No, it's funny, though.  Like, I have an older car.  I'm just lazy.  I need to get a new car.  And I think I'm going to go to Major World, actually.  Major World!  One of the fine sponsors.  I need a contact for those people.  I hear the commercials all the time.  They seem like they're a terrific place to buy a car. 
[00:04:00]  But I'm too lazy to actually, like, do the legwork and give them a call.  By the 59th Street Bridge.  But you bring up a good point with the trucks, and they're just pebbles are flying and clumps of dirt and grass.  And when you have an older car like mine, I don't care.  You don't care, yeah.  It kind of makes me laugh, in a way.  And it makes me laugh, because I'm just picturing the driver just, like, whistling a happy tune while just all hell is breaking loose behind him.  Well, he's just destroying people's vehicles.  Right.  Destroying. 
[00:04:30]  What song do you think he's singing?  Just a happy tune.  Just whistling a happy tune.  And it's just, everyone's just getting pelted behind him.  That's why, when...  New car, though, I'm right there with you.  I mean, the first pebble that hits your new car, you're in a panic.  Oh, you just hear...  Right.  It sounds like it's raining.  Right.  And then, that's why when you're driving into the sunrise or the sunset, you can't see through the windshield, because it's just pitted.  There's just little holes pitted.  So pitted.  So pitted. 
[00:05:00]  My windshield's pitted.  And how long does it take before your new car...  You don't give a crap about your new car.  A couple years in, you think?  No, it usually happens shortly after the first thing happens to it.  But, like, the second something happens to it...  I remember when I first bought, my first new car was that Cougar that I bought out in Boston.  Yeah.  And I was driving back down to New York, stopped at one of the stupid rest areas, and came out, and right next to my door handle was just this big ding. 
[00:05:30]  Some jackass just flung the door open and, bam, put a big dent in my door.  How new was the car?  It was about three months old at that point.  Ooh.  So I just lost my mind.  And then had to just resign myself to the fact, all right, well, what are you gonna...  I can't get the guy.  Yeah.  You know, he's just whistling a happy tune, driving down the road.  Just put a ding in my car. 
[00:06:00]  La-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah.  La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Just adjusting the radio.  Not even realizing the anger he left in his wake.  Right.  Like, there it is.  He's just driving.  Driving and whistling.  Not a clue that I'm in the parking lot going, son of a bitch!  This is a new car.  He's inconsiderate, mother...  And he's just driving down the highway going, I'm making good time.  Yeah, that...  Making good time.  He got some fries there from the rest area.  We just stopped that.  The cover that he has over his load 
[00:06:30]  That is now flopping  And the wind is just  Taking layers of dirt and pebbles  And he's just like  Whistle a happy tune  It's funny too when you drive a car  Off a new car lot  Next thing you know  If a car is within 10 feet of you  You're like whoa you're getting a little too close  Hey hey get away new car here  You know what I think they should have a service  You buy a new car  You pull out of the lot  And then you pull over right away 
[00:07:00]  But you're off the car lot property  And a guy sitting there with a hammer  Just gives you one big  One good thwock  And then you won't have to worry about the paranoia anymore  Yeah  Your car is broken in  I noticed  I drove my car through the car wash the other day  It was pretty filthy  Not the Mustang  The Escalade  And I noticed  I go there's a big dent in my hood  Just a little 
[00:07:30]  Just like a punk  A little dent  Yeah  Where the hell did that come from  No clue  But  Probably someone sitting on your hood  While you were at a restaurant  Yeah  Why not  At the mall or something  You know  Sure  Some of the utes of America  Sure  Having a cigarette  Just having a smoke  Sitting on my hood  So now I'm just like  I really don't  That's why I don't like buying new cars  I don't need all that crap  Yeah  I buy one I really like  And I kind of beat it into the ground  My car is  God 
[00:08:00]  I think six years old now  Really  Maybe seven  Wow  I think I got it before  I got it right around 9-11  Jesus  We signed a big contract  And I had a car delivered to  N.E.W.  I think I told this story  I signed the paperwork  In the middle of 56th Street  And took off with it  And that was it  And I haven't had anyone since  And that  Jeez  But I became  They'll have the buildings back up  Before you get a new car  Yeah  But I became city boy too  So it's insane 
[00:08:30]  It is ridiculous  It's insane to have a brand new car  And live in Manhattan  Because  I park in my garage  Under my building  But see  They want to make as much money as possible  So they probably park  A hundred cars  Too many in this lot  No joke  There are cars  Pretty much piled on top of each other  Yeah  No one has room  I mean  The room between these cars  And you know  My car is nothing  I see cars that are  A hundred  Two hundred thousand dollars  In my garage  And the space between their  Two hundred thousand dollar car  And the SUV next to them 
[00:09:00]  I'm not  I'm not even joking  When I say an inch  Yeah  They squeeze them in  Because they want to pack  As many cars in there  To make as much money as possible  Yeah  And then if you do this  Parking on the side streets  Oh my god  The work trucks just  You know  Pulling in front of you  And tools are just falling  Onto the hood of your car  As they're getting their stuff  For their latest job  I don't know if this happens  In other cities  In New York  When you parallel park  On the side of a street here  It doesn't matter 
[00:09:30]  You hit the other car  You hit the car in front of you  And behind you  You bang into the bumpers  That's just part of  Parallel parking here  Yeah  People won't even turn their heads  If they see that going on  No  And because of the double parking  Your mirrors take a beating  You drive through  And mirrors aren't even  Part of your vehicle anymore  You just  You look at how wide  Your car is  Without the mirrors  And you just take that  Oh yeah  For what it's worth  Because the mirrors  Will just  Boom  They swing in  You hopefully have  The little button 
[00:10:00]  To swing them back out again  Oh yeah  Oh absolutely  To take off someone's mirror  Wait you got buttons  That move your mirrors  Yeah like I can hit a button  How's that  And the mirrors fold in  How's that  I need it to get into my garage  It wouldn't fit  Without the mirrors going in  It's a tight  Speaking  Nice and tight  Yeah that's how I like my garage  Why did we start talking about this  Oh whip them out Wednesday  You saw the wow stickers  Wow stickers  A lot of them  On the way in  And the way home  So Long Island  Is representing  Of course they are  Considering we're both 
[00:10:30]  From Long Island  Yeah  We do very well  We certainly do  We do very well  On Long Island  When it comes to radio  And we do very well  In New York City  Depending on which ratings  You want to follow  Yeah  You want to follow  The new machine type ratings  Or the old book type ratings  Right  And then the ratings  Came out for Boston  And we did extremely well  We did great  I don't know  Excuse me  Isn't it the same show  I know  Are we putting on the same show 
[00:11:00]  Are they doing something else  Are they piping in another show  And where Mantown  Is like in our rear view mirror  At this point  Yeah  Just gone  Goodbye Mantown  We pass them by  We're going on to Chicktown  I don't understand  I don't understand  How that works  What are we supposed to do  To make things better  In one city  And keep them good  In another  Well we got to work  For a healthy radio station  First of all  To be completely honest  With you  And here in New York City  We're starting to get  To that place  The station has the big casino  Because with the new ratings

[00:12:00]  And promotions  And beg for a lousy billboard  So someone knows  You're on the air  They just have so much money  They're like  They're the ones  Singing the happy tune  Humming the happy tune  Whistling the happy tune  Here throw  Oh  Here throw the  Oh we got a million dollars  Just laying around  Throw it at the morning show  Give them billboards  Yeah  So guys  We got a  $50,000 prize  We just don't know  What to do with it  Yeah here  We got $50,000 laying around  Maybe you guys can figure out  Some way to give it away 
[00:12:30]  Right  Oh $50,000  Okay thanks  The prize closet  We got  Yeah  Three car dealerships  Three cars are in there  Yeah  Automobiles  We don't have a prize closet  A lot of flat screen TV  We don't even know  What to do with them  We can't even fit them  It's not even the prize closet  It's a prize conference room  Yeah  We can't fit the flat screen TVs  In the closet  Think about it though  Really  When we worked at NEW  That station was  Oh  S  Had emphysema  When we worked in 
[00:13:00]  Worcester, Massachusetts  That station was S  Especially when we first got there  That station kind of grew with us  We whipped it into shape  And now this K-Rock here in New York  Has been S for  A few years  Ever since the big guy left  Alright  Hey  GTA 4 Anthony  Oh my goodness  I walked out in a huff yesterday  And the one thing I forgot to do  Was  Take my GTA 4 
[00:13:30]  And then I didn't want to walk back  Into the studio awkwardly  Jimmy brought up a good point  What?  I did the same thing  Like  I was ready to storm out yesterday  Yeah  And  Then I realized  I looked over  And saw my game  And I had to go get my game  And it ruined the whole  You're making some emotional decision  To leave  Now it's a calculated thing  Because you realized  You forgot your game  So I moved over  And grabbed my game 
[00:14:00]  And realized  I better just sit back down  Now  It wrecked it  I wondered why  Because I'm like  That's weird  He really should be gone by now  And then I'm like  Wait a minute  Now it makes sense  Yeah  GTA made me sit my ass back down  I marched down  As soon as I left  I'm like  Oh my god  My GTA 4 is sitting right there  And I can't just awkwardly walk back in  Although that would have been a very  Funny like sitcom  Yeah  Yeah  And I'm taking my game  And one other thing  Give me my GTA 4 
[00:14:30]  But how is GTA 4  I love it  I've been waiting  Easily a month to play  Two months  Who knows  And I still haven't played it  I didn't go through  We were talking about it in the office  Me and the guys  And I didn't go through one mission yesterday  I just went around  Wreaking havoc  And seeing what the game looked like  Felt like  The driving is great  The car is much better  The damage that you can inflict 
[00:15:00]  On the cars  A lot more detailed  The game itself  Has so much  It's more immersive  A lot more detail in it  And the killing is just hysterical  Yeah  There's so many  Some things aren't as easy  It isn't as easy  To jack a car anymore  Because sometimes  The drivers put up  A little bit more of a fight  Than they used to  I noticed that  It's harder to kick someone's ass  Just fighting  You can't just step up to people  And start beating the crap out of them  They kind of got a little better at fighting  But I did 
[00:15:30]  I jacked one car  And the guy's hanging on the door  And I'm driving down the street  And he's hanging on the driver's side door  Screaming  He's just going  Ah!  Ah!  So I sideswiped a building  Just to take him out  Just took him out  And another time I jacked the car  And there was a woman in the passenger seat  That didn't get out in time  So I'm driving  And I'm hearing this screaming  And it's the same volume every time 
[00:16:00]  And I was thinking I was passing  Maybe a screaming woman on the side of the road  Sure  Then I realized she was in the car with me  So instead of pulling over  And maybe letting her out  And letting her run  I decided to get the car up as fast as it could go  And hit a brick wall  So she'd fly through the windshield  Yeah, because in the new version  You fly through the windshield  Oh yeah, yeah  You can't just hit something  And everything's fine  That rocks  And sometimes your car will just die out  Like if you get enough damage  And the cops are chasing you 
[00:16:30]  You'll just  You know, your car is dead  It used to take it  Being on fire  And exploding  Yeah, I remember  Sure  Before that  But now your car will just die out  The cops are great too  Chasing you down  Always fun  I spent a lot of time though  And we were talking about  Our individual personalities  And how we played the game  Danny goes  Have you checked out  What it's like to drive drunk?  Because in this game  In this game you can hit a bar 
[00:17:00]  And actually drink or whatever  Yeah  And then when you do get back  In your car  Like the old version of the game  You drive just normal  Yeah  But this version  It's a lot harder to drive the car  I hear from Danny  He said it's impossible  He goes  There should be a point  For just being able to walk  To your car  After you leave the bar  Like you can't even walk  Because even that's hard to do?  Yeah  You get all  You get a little woozy  So Danny was doing that  Spending time getting drunk  In the game  I spent a lot of time 
[00:17:30]  Watching the in-game television  So I'm sitting there  In front of my TV  With the game on  Watching a TV  And the shows they put together  For this game  Amazing  In-game content  In-game content  The TV had TV shows  And ads for other TV shows  How long are the TV shows?  Political ads  I don't know  One cartoon just kept going and going  But it was so filthy  And the language just raw  The C word being thrown around 
[00:18:00]  And political commercials  That just talk about how  This guy running for governor  Is a child molester  And really funny stuff  How you shouldn't vote for him  Because he's bald  Like they just really pound it  And then another political ad  Come on for the other guy  Right  And he'll just be bashed  You sit there and watch  The in-game television  And really be entertained  Funny as hell  What was the  They had a commercial  For like a knockoff 
[00:18:30]  Of Desperate Housewives  It was like a  Desperate Housewives  Type thing  And it was called  Vinewood C's  C word  But they say the whole word  Oh wow  So tune in to Vinewood  And Travis said that  He was playing  And he found Steve's character  Yes  Because we've all been  Looking for ourselves  I guess  Yeah we're all in the game  I mean Anthony has a pretty big  Pretty big part I think  I play a bad guy  But I haven't seen myself  The rest of us have  Minimal exposure in the game 
[00:19:00]  But we're in the game  Which is really cool  And Travis said he found Steve  In what Coney Island  He had to email  He had to email us  Immediately  You found Steve  Yeah I was walking  I was walking back  From the bowling alley  With my lovely girlfriend  Yeah  And I see a cop  So I decided to just  Bump into him  And it's Steve's voice  So I punch him  That's what you do  When you see Steve  In a video game  He punched Steve  And then Steve takes his gun out  And kills my girlfriend 
[00:19:30]  Of course he does  Yeah that  He had to get the  Icky girl out of the way  He didn't pistol whip her first  Huh?  He hates women  Even in video games  Even in the game  Yeah how great is that  Yeah so I spent a lot of time  Bumping into people  To see what they sound like  Yeah  And try to find  People from the show  Travis got one more  But then after he killed  Your girlfriend  Didn't you run him over  Or something?  Or was that somebody else  That was running over Steve?  Oh I was trying to find  Because the second  The second the email  Went out that Steve  Is patrolling the boardwalk 
[00:20:00]  In Coney Island  Right  Everybody just converged  On the boardwalk  To try to kill Steve  So I didn't even bother  Trying to look for him  I drove my car  Up on the boardwalk  And just started running over  Everyone on the boardwalk  They're flying off  Onto the beach  No actually  We hadn't hooked up  To the multiplayer yet  Yeah  That's great  You didn't even want  To hear his voice  You just wanted to kill  No I just wanted  Everyone dead  Everyone  And the people will  Just rag doll  Off your car 
[00:20:30]  And some of them  Are kind of hanging  On to the car  For a little while  They roll over  Onto your hood  You cut the wheel  And they fly off  Like the physics  To the game  Is really good  Really good  Very cool  Had a great time  Just wreaking havoc  Didn't do one mission  I'll start doing that  But just to get the feel  Of the controls  And the cars  And see what's around  Just walking around  And wreaking havoc  Very very very nice  And of course  The officials  Because it's based  On New York City  The New York City officials 
[00:21:00]  Upset over GTA 4  We got some audio  Some people are upset  After the break  Bloomberg doesn't support  A game that awards  Points for killing cops  I gotta tell you something  A lot of the NYPD  Listens to this radio show  And we know a lot  Of the NYPD  And guess what  They play this game  Yeah  They love this game  It's a fun game  When you're shooting  People in the game  You're not thinking  You know  Well this is great  I'm shooting police officers  Yeah  I should go out  And do this  It's not  That doesn't 
[00:21:30]  Doesn't cross your mind  You're just having fun  And laughing your ass off  At the fact that  You can just  Wreak complete havoc  You can just  Pure chaos  In the streets  Yeah  And the game's  Gotta be safe  Because  And family oriented  Because John Montone's in it  Yes  10-10 wins  John Montone  He's the big news guy  Here in New York City  Yeah  Everyone knows his voice  Maybe they don't know his name  But they know his voice  He's been doing it forever  Like kind of  The human interest story  Like he'll go to 
[00:22:00]  Coney Island  When it gets warm  And talk to people  Eating ice cream  And hot dogs  And crap like that  Yeah  And I heard his voice  Coming through my car radio  Right  There's a different name  But it's him  And he's doing one of those  Human interest kind of stories  I'm John Montone  John Montone  10 to  Or it was  Weasel news  As they fill in  The largest pothole  Here in New York City  So what do you think  Of the pothole  Well they gotta fix these things  Because it's  Damaging the vehicles  Damaging the vehicles  Yeah he's that guy 
[00:22:30]  And he's in the game  So it's gotta be safe  Because John Montone  Wouldn't do anything  Risky or edgy  No  This morning he was  Broadcasting from  A subway escalator  That didn't work  On 14th Street  See that's the type  Of stories this guy does  So people like Mary  Will have to walk down  So what is it like  To walk down those stairs  Well I'd rather  Have the escalator working  Rather have the escalator working  Right  That's his like 
[00:23:00]  That's his style  His style  Alright so when we get back  We got audio from Bloomberg  And some other people  Just really pissed off  That this game is everywhere  It's gonna sell 9 million copies  By the end of the week  And trust me  There's not gonna be  9 million crimes  9 million deaths  And murders  Because everybody that buys this  Apparently goes crazy  And thinks it's real  You know what  They'll probably have a couple  But they're damaged  To begin with  We can't help those people  Sorry  Why take the fun away  From everybody  Because maybe  Maybe two or three people 
[00:23:30]  Will be  Will do something stupid  Because of  A violent video game  And I still don't think  There's a connection  Although I did  I did buy another gun yesterday  Alright we'll get into that  After the break  My god  Oh look at Jimmy's face  My god  He's concerned for me  We can't keep track anymore  Yes  I also like the fact  That everybody's shocked  That the mayor doesn't like  Grand Theft Auto  Of course he doesn't  What are you gonna say  I love the game  I've been playing it now  Since it came out  Yeah I was late for work  This morning  So I was killing a process  Of course he can't like it 
[00:24:00]  I guess it's bad  For New York City  Maybe  To show it in this light  I don't want one  But he did say  Although crime is down  In New York City  He had to mention that  Blah blah blah blah blah  Alright we gotta take  Our first break  Phones are lit  But if you need  The phone number later  Or write it down  You're gonna eventually need it  We take a lot of phone calls  877-212  O&A  I can play that  After the break  Somebody made a  Stupid caller sweeper  Derek did 
[00:24:30]  It's pretty funny  Want to hear it real fast  I guess we can do it  Sure  Yeah we're late  What's another 20 seconds  Well I'm late  Dirk put this together  Late for not being pregnant  It says on the line  Do your own show please  You can't even come up  With anything original  Hey we got you listening  You dummy  This is what we do  We're doing our show  How stupid are you  How stupid are you  How stupid are you  How stupid are you  How stupid are you  How stupid are you  How stupid are you 
[00:25:00]  You got up  And went out of your way  To tune in our show  You idiot  We don't sound very cordial  He wasn't one of our guys  No  Some of these people  Call and make believe  They're listeners  And they're just calling  From another freaking galaxy  Alright hey  Really fast  I did a lot of reading  Last night  I just want to thank  The listeners  And that's that  As we continue  After the break  Opie and Anthony  Radio Shock Jock  Opie and Anthony  To everybody  The Opie and Anthony show 
[00:25:30]  So we got the New York City officials  Upset over GTA 4  Kind of teased this before the break  So let's see what they have to say  Jimmy made a great observation though  Yeah true  You're quick to say  This is outrageous  I can't believe they have a problem  With this game  Oh yeah it's the mayor  Jimmy  He's supposed to  It's like the mayor  Isn't going to come out and say  I love this game  I spent all day playing it  I see Bloomberg  With dark circles under his eyes  And his hair like askew  Yeah  Jimmy says 
[00:26:00]  Some of the most logical things  Sometimes  Because we're right  Because we just go off  Like idiots  Right  Like yeah the mayor  What a jerk man  Stupid mayor  He doesn't understand us man  Coming out against GTA  Because it looks like  New York City  And it  Yeah he's the mayor  Of New York City  And probably upset with it  Yeah  Here we go  Grand Theft Auto 4  Set in a seedy fictional environment  Called Liberty City  Which eerily resembles  New York City  With such well known landmarks 
[00:26:30]  As the Statue of Liberty  The Brooklyn Bridge  And the Cyclone  At Coney Island  To some aficionados  It sets a new standard  For what's possible  In video games  With billboards and posters  Around town  Touting its arrival  The lines wrapped around  City blocks  When the video game  Went on sale at midnight  It's controversy  Controversy sells  Critics complain  It's all about  Hijacking cars  Assaulting pedestrians  And picking up  Strange women  Mayor Bloomberg  Is not a fan  His spokesman  Saying he opposes  Any game  Where you earn points  For killing police officers 
[00:27:00]  Other politicians agree  First observation  When did we go back  To real audio  Real audio  Remember that  On the computer  Oh was that awful  God was it bad  And secondly  Thank you to Gary G  In Edison, New Jersey  He brings up a great point  Before you move on  Opie  Here is hypocrisy  Bloomberg will crap  On GTA 4  But the mayor's office  Will continue to issue  Permits to allow 
[00:27:30]  Violent movies  Set in New York  To be filmed  It's all about  New York's financial interest  Not the children's  Oh that's true  If you want to  You know  If you want to  Take that route  Then people would argue  That you're not being  Interactive with a film  For six hours a day  You're just watching it once  And then going home  As opposed to like  Rewinding it  And backing over the bodies  Alright Jimmy  Jeez  That's great stuff  It's like you know  People always  Try to make these  Tie in  Yeah well Bloomberg  Let's alcohol  You got us  Now this game plays 
[00:28:00]  To old stereotypes  About New York City  Today we're the safest  Big city in America  With the best police force  This game  If it was actually  Based on reality  Would have two levels  Steal a car  Go to jail  Grand theft  Also has an M rating  Right in the right hand  Corner here  Which means  That 117 is allowed  To buy it  And many think  That's a very good idea  I think they're doing  The right thing  With the ESRB  You know  Kids shouldn't buy it  And kids under 18  You know  Can't buy it 
[00:28:30]  And they shouldn't play it  I think it might  Glamorize sex and violence  But no more than  Any other popular media  As many as 6 million copies  Could sell in this first week  Generating more than  400 million dollars  Wow  Although we've heard  That number is closer  To 9  9 million in the first week  We'll see  We'll see how much they sell  Laszlo gave me a call yesterday  He's still over there in England  Yeah  Gave me a call  And he's like  What do you think  I'm like  I haven't even played it yet  I just got home 
[00:29:00]  Yeah he was eager  To hear some reviews  But really good  I love it  I think it's great  Yeah absolutely  Alright moving on  Just a great story  That's making us laugh  Really hard today  It's horrific  But you know  Some of the horrific ones  Are the funniest  For the rest of the week  We're going to point out  The difference between  Our fine radio show  And the morning zoo  Here in New York City  The number one listened to  Morning show 
[00:29:30]  In New York radio  And it's just god awful  And someone needs to say that  They got a lot of props yesterday  The ratings came out  Picture of Elvis Duran  And how great he's doing  And then you just take a little peek  At what he's doing  And it's just god awful stuff  And this type of story  They would be like  Oh my god  This poor person  Oh my gosh  Oh Froggy would say something  What's the story  We have to figure out  What Froggy would say  Well here's the story  I think it's hilarious  The Southern Illinois 
[00:30:00]  Newspaper carrier  Is getting credit  For rescuing  One of his elderly customers  She apparently spent  At least two days  Trapped underneath  Her dead husband's body  The carrier says  He became concerned  After noticing  Their papers stacked up  For days in their mailbox  And when he went  Inside the house  He found 77 year old  Blanche Roberts  He called mine  And sat with her  Until authorities arrived  The coroner says  There is nothing suspicious  About the death  Of her husband  He believes Fred Roberts  Died of a heart attack  After mowing the lawn  She was nagging him  To mow the lawn  Comes in 
[00:30:30]  I'm just gonna fall on you  He sat with her  Until help arrived  Tell me to help  With the fat man  Off her  Yeah  What the hell  He probably had a heart attack  While they were having sex  If he was on top of her  I don't know  They said  The story I heard  That he was on her legs  Like  Oh maybe he was  You know  Blanche  Hey Blanche  You want a little something  I'm going under the sheets  Blanche  He's probably so sweaty 
[00:31:00]  From cutting the grass too  That's the last time  You want someone to die on you  Is rather they cut the lawn  Lawn mower man  The book  Not the movie  Yeah  The book  Much better  Yeah  Yeah  With the bad B.O.  Got the bad B.O.  And now the smell of death  Creeping  And then she's got to lay there  Like how creepy is it  Laying there  Alright  You know  Maybe during the day  But then it starts getting dark out  And you just glance over  And see those glazed over eyes  And that half open mouth  Yeah  Maybe a fly buzzing around 
[00:31:30]  And I'm a big fan  I forgot what TV show  Or movie  Put this into my brain  But I always wondered  What happened  Oh I think it was  Austin Powers  I always wonder what  Happened after  Everyone has a really big laugh  And remember that  Great scene in Austin Powers  Where they kept laughing  And laughing  And laughing  Until there was no more laughing  And then it was just  Really awkward and stuff  I've always wondered that  Now in this situation  She's like  Obviously screaming  In a horrific way  Her husband's dead  On top of her 
[00:32:00]  Help  Then the screaming stops  And then what happens  Do you just  Oh god  What do you start doing  After that  Get off of me  Do you start counting  The tiles on the ceiling  Do you think about  Your loved ones  What do you do  After the horrific  Screaming stops  And do you  At one point  Like fall asleep  In the four days  And wake up  And go  Honey could you get me  Oh that's right  You're dead  That's right  You're dead  And I can't move  You're dead  And you're trapping me  Like that lady  With the crane  Fell on her 
[00:32:30]  Years ago  I'm just laying here  In my own bed  With my fat husband on me  Poor old crow  Oh that's  Oh that's terrible  Oh good gosh  Yeah  Oh that poor woman  Oh that poor woman  Kenny's  Yeah  We got  Kenny's gonna be  Doing traffic and weather  Together on the 8th today  But he's also working  On a new segment  Called  When bad things  Happen to good people  Yeah  We can't wait for that  We're hoping 
[00:33:00]  By tomorrow  He'll have enough  Stories for that  That's perfect for him  Yeah  Because he loves it  I'm just seeing  If there's more  In the AP story here  Bruce Pitts  Had a feeling  Something was wrong  When the newspapers  Be on piling up  Okay we got that  84 year old  Blanche Roberts  84  Helpously  Looking back at him  Alright so on Sunday  The worried newspaper carrier  Cracked open  An unlocked side door  And saw  84 year old  Blanche Roberts  Help us  Looking back at him  Help me 
[00:33:30]  Her right leg  Pinned beneath  The body  Of her 77 year old  Husband who apparently  Had been dead  For days in the home  How weak is this  Old jellyfish  Your right leg  Is pinned  Your right leg  And she can't  Kick with the left one  And roll him  Roll his fat body  Off of her  God Blanche  Stupid Blanche  Nice survival instincts  You dummy  You just lay there  And try to  Try to chew your arms  Off first  Stupid Blanche  What'd she eat  In four years  Husband's face  Is gnawed upon  I was hungry  His ears 
[00:34:00]  His hair  Blanche  Died of a heart attack  He's described as a  Good sized man  In quotes  Great big fat person  But there was no doubt  That Blanche Roberts  Once pinned on a landing  Leading from the kitchen  To the basement  Couldn't wiggle free  Burke said she was trapped  In kind of an awkward position  Oh god  Pitt said she was sitting up  But wedged against a wall  So  Oh maybe  The hallway  A little landing hallway  Was too thin 
[00:34:30]  For her to actually  Push him off  He probably came in  Against the wall  He probably came in  In full cardiac arrest  Yeah  Was heading toward her  And just fell  And took her  And himself  Right into the wall  Fell right into the wall  Yeah  Would it be funny  They arrested her  And charged her  With murder  Like they  Her legs  It was  Murder  It was a fat man  On her legs  Sam  He was napping  And she killed him  She choked him  With my members only 
[00:35:00]  Jack  Jim C  If we could go  And find the body  Jim C  Intriguing murder  It's always murder  With him  Why can't the guy  Just have come in  Had a heart attack  And fallen on his wife  What was his boss's name  With the gay part  On mustache  John Astin  His real name was  I don't know  What his name  In the show was  John Astin  Was in that  I forgot about that  Yeah  We'll get the answer  In a minute or two  I'm sure it's murder  Hey  Anthony before the break 
[00:35:30]  Was talking about  How he got another gun  Yeah  Before you tell us though  We got a Boston  Home invasion  Oh  Jesus  We got another one folks  Boston  And in  Snootin  Really  Oh yeah  See  Home invasions happen  In the nice areas  Because you don't want  To invade  A broke ass home  Snootin  Or you know  There's another name  For Newton  Newton  Yeah  Change a letter around  Blank town

[00:37:00]  Police are searching  For a group of several men  Accused of a violent  Home invasion  The men forced their way  Into a home on  Redwood Avenue  In Newton  On Friday night  As many as five  Armed  Oh boy  Men  Here's your worst nightmare  That is my worst nightmare  So you got five armed men  They come in the door  They blindfolded a woman  Tied her up  With duct tape  And then  Police said the suspects  Made off with jewelry  A safe  And an undetermined  Amount of cash  Mmhmm  Officials are looking for clues 
[00:37:30]  To help them identify  The intruders  A sketch was released  Of a composite sketch  Of the man who acted  As the ringleader  Come on  Big top hat  And a whip  The ringleader  How humiliating  Would that be  Because the woman  Was blindfolded  She was unable  To get a good look  At the other  Of course  It's kind of hard  To get a good look  That's why they  Blindfold you  Dummy  Oh that's a nightmare  So there you go  You're minding  Your own business  You think you're safe  You buy the big house  In the real nice neighborhood

[00:49:00]  Scripted  A lot of speculation  Going on because of her  Faux pas  Last night  I um  I blew off American Idol  I watched the last two seasons  Because of you by the way  Anthony turned me on to American Idol  Yeah now I can't be bothered  Yeah you know  You haven't watched in a couple years  But  You told me to take a peek  I took a peek  I got hooked for a couple seasons  The Sun Jaya  I think that's gonna be the pinnacle  Of that show  And uh  This year  I've watched maybe a total of an hour  I watched some of the auditions 
[00:49:30]  And then I took a peek  I think uh  Last week  Or the week uh  Before that  I don't even know  That's more than I've seen  Yeah and uh  There's a  There's a video making the rounds  You go to TMZ  You can check it out for yourself  But Paula Abdul  Is babbling  And talking about a song  That hasn't even been sung yet  Or a performance  That hasn't been done yet  Yeah  Yeah Dr. Steve uh  Uh texted me  Last night  And said  Oh my god  You gotta see Paula Abdul  She's uh  She's lost it  Um  And there's been speculation 
[00:50:00]  Over the years  That this show's been on  That she's been on  Something  Uh there's always an excuse  Uh remember that  News interview she did  Where she was just  Out of her mind  Yeah  And they said  Oh well  She did  She was traveling  Yeah  She was traveling  She was tired  She went traveling  From bar to bar  Yeah  Yeah  Was she on a bar crawl  Yeah  Well  So last night  She um  All the uh  Contestants are lined up  On stage  And I guess they had  Uh sung a song 
[00:50:30]  And  She starts critiquing  One of the uh  One of the uh  Contestants  And talking about  His two songs  That he sang  And how she enjoyed  The first one  But didn't enjoy  The second one as much  I'm not sure  The actual uh  Which one she liked  Better  But the fact of the  Matter was  He didn't sing  Two songs  Right  He sang one song  And she was reading  From something  Yeah  Yeah  It was really odd  Now people are starting  To speculate  That uh  You know  That they have  A lot of this stuff  Prepared for them  Ahead of time 
[00:51:00]  Yeah  Yeah  Because they're  Trying to make  Good TV  Mmhmm  You thought it was  Off the  Yeah it's live  But you think  It's off the cuff  And stuff  People are starting  To wonder  Well do these uh  Contestants maybe  Sing the song  Somewhere else first  And then they  Then they sing it  On the show  To make  Yep  To make good TV  Obviously  But they already know  How the performance  Is in general  Yeah  And then they write  Out their scripts  For them  Yep  And Paul Abdul  Might have you know  Blown up American Idol  Spot last night  Because why else  Would you be talking  About a song  That hasn't been 
[00:51:30]  Sung yet  Yeah  Exactly  And and and  Perhaps there's  Some manipulation  Going on  Uh where  The the producers  Of the show  And uh  They want a certain  Contestant to win  Uh get a little  More uh voting  In than  Than another contestant  So they let the uh  Judges  They give them a script  Right  That's speculation  Right  You're missing the obvious  Uh yes  Yes Jimmy  Paula Abdul  Sees the future  Well uh  That is what um 
[00:52:00]  Ryan Seacrest was saying  Really  Trying to cover up  I think we  We have the audio  You see the future  Ryan's funny  Oh what a  What a laugh  Paula rates Jason  Whoever he is  Sloppy party bottom  Sees the future  His face in a shag rug  The Hollywood Hills  Ten years from now  Gentleman behind him  Paula rates Jason  Don't know who he is  And that's kind of sad  Because I was a fan  Of this show for a while  Uh thinking he's  Performed two songs  When he's only  Performed uh 
[00:52:30]  One song  Paula  Oh gosh  We've never had to  Write these things down  Fast enough  Um Jason  The first song  I loved hearing  Your lower register  Which we never  Really hear  Um  The second song  I felt like  Your usual charm  Wasn't  It was missing from me  It kind of left me  A little empty  And uh  The two songs  Made me feel like  You're not  Fighting hard enough  To  To get into the top four  So  David Cook  No we should just  Just on the first song  Just on the first one 
[00:53:00]  Just on the first one  I thought you  Oh my god  I thought you sang twice  Wow  Just once  But Paula  Paula  You're seeing the future  Baby  You're seeing the future  She's coming back  Alright  This is high  This is really  Really  Bad  You hear the audience  Start laughing  Because everyone knew  They knew  And they were looking around  Like what is she talking about  And then when she goes  Oh I thought you sang two songs  Simon looks at her like  You stupid bitch  Well he wants her gone 
[00:53:30]  It's obvious  He just looked like  Oh my god  You idiot  This is his baby  And obviously she's very  Very popular  With the American Idol audience  And he just wants  To be done with her  And get this show  Back on track  With like real judges  That's absolutely  What it looks like  Paula says  She was confused  She was reading the notes  For the next singer  Oh really  But the next singer  I don't think  Had two songs  Performed yet  I don't think so either  A little more  She wrote down notes 
[00:54:00]  On every singer  It was just like  She wrote one for this guy  And was reading the criticism  Of the next person  Like it was like  If Ope sang  And Ant sang  And I said  Well Ope  I thought you looked good  But Ant  Your voice didn't sound right  And I just read it  All as one  Right right right  Something simple like that  I don't know  It didn't seem that way  It seemed like  She made some kind of  A huge mistake  I like your explanation  Jimmy  But in that clip  She did say  Oh I thought  You sang two songs  And she's just  Addressing one person  Right right  I don't know  It was really odd 
[00:54:30]  It was just weird  Yeah  Here's more audio  Paula  Paula  Paula  Who is your favorite  Who is your favorite  Okay what  Who is your favorite  Paula  Who is your favorite  You know what  I'm looking  It's your notes David  You're fantastic  And it was a song  That wasn't known  Okay  Okay  Right  And it was a what  Huh  And it was a song  That what  I don't know  She just  She just babbled  Wow  She is just a  Babbling buffoon 
[00:55:00]  That's  That's getting  A lot of attention  Today  A lot of attention  Yeah  She's been  She's been a little  A little wacky  The entire series  This year  No every year  Wow  Every year  She starts off  With the audition process  Kind of okay  Like I think they tell her  Look  Fly straight  And then  As the season goes on  She gets a little wackier  Let's just say  A lot of people saying  She heard the rehearsal  But that's basically  What we're saying  I'm sure these 
[00:55:30]  Contestants sing their songs  So you get a  You're getting a  Pretty good idea  How it's gonna  Play out  When they do the live show  Yeah  But still  That's  That's  That's bad  To talk about a song  That hasn't officially  Been performed  On the live show yet  I wonder if they're  There for that  Or I wonder if  Some people are  Sitting there  Writers  And then they write  Comments  Right  Watching the rehearsal  Going on  And then just give it to them  And then they kind of  Like pump it up  A little bit  Yeah  They kind of 
[00:56:00]  Act like it's them  Their words  Maybe for her  Because she doesn't  Seem quite right  I can't imagine  They're writing notes  For Simon  Yeah  Or for Randy  For that matter  Those two seem to be  On top of what's going on  Yeah  Hey Ant  We're trying to like  Broaden our appeal  So we're trying to do  Some more sports  On this show  Oh  And being the sports expert  You are  Yeah  Want to run through  Some of these  Some of the sports stories  Sure  This morning  What do you think  About the Barry Zito  Thing happening  Wow  That came out of nowhere 
[00:56:30]  It sure did  Yeah  I was like  Barry Zito  Yeah  And that whole situation  I was  It surprised me  Like it did everybody else  You were surprised  Yeah  Hell yeah  But a lot of people  Really weren't surprised  Because his performance  Wasn't that great this year  Well that's what I mean  Like I was surprised  Personally  That his performance  Wasn't that good  Okay  Yeah  Yeah  That was  That was surprising to me  I should have been  Clearer on that  So you're all over the fact  That the Giants 
[00:57:00]  Demoted Barry Zito  To the bullpen  A year after  He signs  Largest pitching contract  Ever  It was so surprising  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Well you know  Things like that  Are bound to happen  You watched  The Ranger game  Last night  Oh yeah  Yeah  What do you think  I think  There was some  You know  Some problems  For who  Eh you know  The um  The guys  You know 
[00:57:30]  The Rangers  Very good  Ah  Very good  Yeah yeah  Certainly were  There was some  Problems  With the Rangers  I knew that  And what  Happened in the end  Ah  Did they work out  These problems  Or  Ah you know  It looked like  They were really  Trying  Yeah  To work out  The problems  Did they succeed  Yeah  In a way  You can say  They did  But in another  Way  No  Yeah well  You're right  The Penguins  Beat the Rangers  Last night  Yeah  That's what I meant 
[00:58:00]  Like you know  They tried  Which is good  As far as  Team morale  Goes and stuff  But I couldn't  Quite pull it off  Yeah  Rangers are  Behind in that  Series now  Three to zip  Wow  Which is very  Good for Jimmy  Because Jimmy's  Going to be in  Pittsburgh this weekend  And you know  He wants this  Series done with  So people come  And see his show  Only Friday  Yes I want the  Penguins just to  Smash those  Dirty Rangers  Very personal  Bunch of queers  The Rangers are  Flyers Canadians  What are you thinking  What am I thinking  Game four tonight

[01:16:00]  They used to trade  Babe Ruth  Is going up  For sale today  It's on the  Auction block  I'm not a big  Memorabilia guy  I told you about  My Pete Maravich  Cancel check  Because he was  Getting some plumbing  Done and I was a  Huge Pete Maravich  Fan growing up  I like that check  But this check  Oh my god  I would love  To have on display  I'd love to be rich  And buy it  And then just  Rip it up  I guess the check  Is for  What was it  $50,000  Yeah  That's what it  Looked like  When they did 
[01:16:30]  The story on TV  Today  They traded  Babe Ruth  For $50,000  To the Yankees  Back in the day  And now  This check  This cancelled check  Is going to fetch  Something like  $100,000 today  That's all  I thought it would  Be more than that  That's what they're  Saying  But you gotta think  It's going to be  Way  Way above  $100,000  I would guess  Close to half a million  For something like that  That's a biggie  That is a big item  To have  As a collector  But getting back  To the Yankees  They got this  John Sterling  Who John Sterling  Is their play-by-play 
[01:17:00]  Guy on the radio  And the thing  You have a love-hate  Relationship with him  Because he can call  A great game  He's a very  Competent and  Interesting announcer  I like his voice  I like the way  He calls balls and  Strikes  And just the innings  But he has  These catchphrases  Which he obsesses over  And it becomes about him  And it's completely  Irritating  Yeah he's kind of  Made these catchphrases  Something that people  Will recognize  Him for  And it takes away  From the game  When I watch my sports  I don't mind a catchphrase 
[01:17:30]  If it's done  Kind of like  Very organically  You know what I mean  But a lot of these  Catchphrases  Is that you can tell  It's just being  Just forced  Yeah  Just kind of  Shoved in your face  We were talking  About how he probably  Stays home  Trying to figure out  What to say  If a certain player  Gets a home run  Right  It's just very  Calculated  Not spontaneous  What did Al Michael  Say back in the day  Do you believe in miracles  He's a douche  Oh  Do you believe in miracles  Or whatever  It was just very  He probably had that  Prepared or whatever 
[01:18:00]  But it was so organic  How he just kind of  Kind of  Said it  Yeah  You know  I don't know  I think it's become  Because  Occasionally you don't  Mind it thrown in there  But it's just this thing  That he had  And they're corny  They're not funny  They're not engaged  They just  They're corny  And some dummy  In the front office  Probably goes  John that was a good one  Today we all loved it  And he just  Stupid Harry Moskowitz  Thinks he did a good job  Yeah  So from last  Really  Yes 
[01:18:30]  Is that the  Is it good  No  Something else  Oh okay  We're working on something  Nothing  We're hearing that  There was a guest star  On American Idol  Last night  And we're  No  No  No it didn't match up  Oh no  Piece of garbage  Oh well  Some bits just don't work  Oh well  Sorry bad back  Really fast  John in Cleveland  Giving this Rachel Steele  A lot of attention  But I think that's going to end  Drastically in about 10 seconds  John  Actually Scott 
[01:19:00]  Hey Scott  Yeah  Hey  Sorry to kill the vibe  But Rachel's happily married  With one child  Alright  Well  Screw Cleveland  Who  Who I don't remember  Who we were talking about  No you're missing something here  Yeah  Huh  Let's ruin that marriage  That wouldn't  We would do that  Let's ruin it  Well YouTube has  Rachel Steele  Gives a tour  Of the 92.3  K-Rock Studios  Oh yeah  So I've just been  Kind of watching that  Is it nice  Yeah she's wearing  A little denim skirt  She's very leggy 
[01:19:30]  She's kind of walking around  Alright  Yeah  I bet her husband's a cuckold  He likes to see other radio guys  Come and let's hope for that  Cuckold  So John Sterling  Just did the ultimate  Home run call  During a Yankee broadcast  Last week I think  I think that's what Danny  Was telling me last week  And we're hoping  Because we're broadcasting  To a lot of cities  At this point  We're hoping that  You take a look  At your local guy  And if he's doing  Obnoxious stuff  With home run calls  If you could send that in to us 
[01:20:00]  Because we would love  To compare  This John Sterling guy  To other announcers  Around America  So far we haven't gotten any  And I know there's some  Other guys doing  The exact same thing  Sterling's doing  And I'm not going to  Give the whole thing away  But one thing he would do  Which I kind of liked at times  When a home run was hit  He would say  It is high  It is far  It is gone  And that was tolerable  But then he morphed it  Into a  It is high  It is  Operatic 
[01:20:30]  You want to choke him  Like Johnny Ola  And then he puts  Like catchphrases  It's just  It's  Douche chill  Yeah  Here's the 1-1  There goes  And he left center  Oh it is high  It is far  It is gone  What a shot  By A-Rod  All the way over  The netting  Into the visitors  Bullpen  Oh  An A-bomb  From A-Rod  He hits a  Monumental 
[01:21:00]  Jolt  And the Yankees  Take a 3-1 lead  Abreu  And Rodriguez  Go back to back  And a belly to belly  And the Yankees  Take a 3-1 lead  A back to back  And a belly to belly  I need a nap  Oh  A nap after that  My scalp is tingling  An A-bomb  From the Enola Gay  Exactly  How about the  Why does he just feature  Other things about the player 
[01:21:30]  An A-bomb  From the guy  Who's never won  A championship  An A-bomb  From the stripper  Lover in Toronto  How about that  How about that  You really don't like  The Yankees anymore  I can't stomach  That dirty A-Rod  Dirty A-Rod  I can't stomach him  Hate him  Never won anything  A back to back  And a Jimmy  Doesn't get an autograph  Let's say hi to Taylor  In Virginia  Taylor  Hey guys

[01:56:00]  Can I tell you right now  I'm pushing my groin  Into the console  Why  Redrum  On pal talk  Redrum's on pal talk  And she seems to be  Just writhing around  On her bed  Wearing nothing  But the tiniest  Of little  Thong panties  And that's it  And she  She does this little move  Where she lays on her belly  And kind of  Puts her leg to the side  Really shows off  Her  Her hang  You think she's working up a log 
[01:56:30]  See that  There  That's the move  I'm like  She's fire out  Like a roman candle  Roman candle  Damn  Jimmy  I spent  I spent easily  20 minutes in there  Today Jimmy  A lot of work  For little  A little payoff  A little payoff  Yeah  Oh I hate  When that happens  You didn't have a good harvest  For what you put in  My god man 
[01:57:00]  Unbelievable  I might have to work  Work that area a little bit  To make some room  For some of this stuff  Hey  Once again  Because we're very  Very jealous radio guys  Everyone knows that  The ratings came out  Here in New York  And  Well  We didn't do too well  But when it comes to  The new ratings  We're doing very well  Very confusing  But they're still using  The old ratings  So we're a little  We're a little blue  Yeah 
[01:57:30]  A little blue about it  And  What really just  Pisses us off  Is that  The number one  Radio show  In New York City  Is  Elvis Duran  And his morning zoo  Which is a lot of  Who gives a crap radio  I disagree  They're not funny people  They're not edgy people  They just give you info  That you can get on the internet  I don't know  Yeah  It just seems like  That type of  Water cooler  Like  Just crap  And they don't even 
[01:58:00]  Have a twist on it  Like at least when we play  Like the Paul Abdul audio  We try to give you  A little twist  A little Opie and Anthony  Twist to things  And  And they don't even  Have enough material  To fill up their show  Every morning  So they play the  Popular songs of the day  The pop songs  We could do that  And for some reason  People just  Eating this crap up  So we decided  That we really need  To do more  Morning zoo type things  Yeah let's just  Take the lead there  See what works  And go with it  And we know  They do some kind of  Like phone scam  Or phone slam 
[01:58:30]  Or phone slam  Or wire tap  I don't know  Illegal wire tap  What's it called  I don't know  But I gotta tell you guys  Like if you hear  A prank call  Like a current  Like a brand new  Prank call on a radio show  It's completely made up  Because you're not  Allowed to do that anymore  That's a biggie  With these radio companies  They will not  You can't even sneak it in  No  Without all hell  Breaking loose  So right off the bat  If you do hear these things  On a radio show  And it's not old  Like we play some of our  Old ones when it was legal  They're just making it up 
[01:59:00]  Yeah  So with that  You can't do it  With that said  We figure we better  Start doing  You know  Phone slams  Phone scams  On our show  So here's the first one  From Club Soda Candy  Club Soda Candy  Is going to take on  This whole morning zoo thing  He certainly is  He's doing a great job  So far  Yeah  We're going to come up  With other bits  That follow the morning zoo format  And Kenny's going to be  Doing them for our show  In the coming weeks  Okay  With that  Here's Club Soda Candy  And his first 
[01:59:30]  Phone slam  Hi is this Ray  Yeah  Ray your family's dead  What  Remember that  Faulty propane tank  In your backyard  No  Well it blew the house up  What  They're all dead  Oh my god  You've just been  Phone slammed  Who is this  Goodbye  That is so stupid 
[02:00:00]  But that's exactly  How they do it  Right  I would like him  To have led into it  A moment like  Hey Ray  You know that  Faulty propane tank  Yeah  Well it killed your family  But he put it right into  Hey Ray  Your family's dead  And then he tells a back story  A back story  On the death  Oh  Danny comes running  And  Danny what's up  He's trying to outrun Nick  Oh you got Alvin Holmes  The beer bill guy 
[02:00:30]  Right  From earlier  I'm a  Member of the  Alabama House of Representatives  Here in Alabama  We haven't even said  Hi  How are you sir  Hi Alvin  Yes sir  Now  We were listening  To some audio  Of you  Talking about  This beer ruling  Absolutely  On the house floor  Yeah  Can you explain  For people that might be  Tuning in for the first time  This morning  This is a big thing 
[02:01:00]  Going on in Alabama  Well it has passed  The Alabama legislature  And raising the content  In certain beer  Alcohol content  In certain beer  And of course  I was in opposition  To the beer  You were  Yes  I was in opposition  To it  My statement  On the floor  Of the House  Of representatives  Is that  What we have  At the present time  Is fine  And we do not  Need to increase  The alcohol content  In beer  Or any other 
[02:01:30]  Alcoholic beverages  Here in Alabama  Well Mr. Holmes  I think you raised  A good point  Because I mean  Like what's  What are they  Trying to say  Like what's wrong  With like the other  The beers we have  What are  We have  Yeah how many beers  We got  What's a beer  We have  Oh my god  I don't know  You have plenty of  Like what  Can you name a few  Bud  Budweiser  That's fine  Yeah  Yeah they have  Budweiser  And other traditional  Beers here  In Alabama  I think  We have  I was in opposition 
[02:02:00]  To it  Because we have  Here in the state  Of Alabama  Numbers  I can't  Call all  All of them  The beers  We have  And wines  And other  But what  What beers  Sir what beers  Are we talking  About  You got the  Budweiser  It's a German  Beer  The one that  They're trying  To get it now  Well  They wanted to  Legalize  Raising the  Content of 
[02:02:30]  Alcohol in  German beer  In Alabama  And they did  Oh they did  Is it from  Is it a German  Beer for export  Only  Is it piss  Washer  I heard of a  Beer that they're  Doing for export  Yeah yeah  It is  Okay  It is  For export  Only  Piss  Washer  Yeah  Yes and  I was in  Opposition to  It  I thought  Many of our  Young people  Have access  To beer  And I  Thought it would  Be a bad  Thing for the  Young people  Oh really  So  You know 
[02:03:00]  Like people  That are  Older  Can make up  Their own  Minds  But the  Younger  People might  Just want  More alcohol  Absolutely  And at  Colleges  Universities  Across the  Country  You know  At fraternities  And sororities  Gathering  You know  They have a  Lot of beer  And I  Thought that  It would be  A bad thing  For the  Young people  But it  Did pass  Unfortunately  What is  This going  To mean  For the  Great  State of  Alabama  Just mean 
[02:03:30]  That the  People in  Alabama  Will be  Able to  Drink a  Beer  With more  Alcohol content  In it  Do you  Think that's  Good though  In a way  Like for  Financial reasons  Because like  Instead of  Well it  Will help  The state  Financially  Some  But I  Think the  Problems  That it  Will create  Among the  Young people  Will be  Greater  Than the  Benefits  That the  State of  Alabama  Will receive  Well sir  Would they  Consider raising  The legal  Limit for  Drinking and 
[02:04:00]  Driving  Because a  Lot of  People say  It's way  Too low  And they  Should  What is  In Alabama  Is it a  1.0  Is the  Legal limit  For driving  I mean  You have  To be  A certain  Age  In the  State of  Alabama  You have  To be  21 years  Old  To buy  Alcoholic  Beverage  Right  But oh  Yeah  No sir  I mean  When you're  Drinking  They do  A breathalyzer  Test  There's a  Legal limit  You're  Allowed  To have  0.1  Or is it  0.08  Yes  I think 
[02:04:30]  That is the  Correct one  Maybe 0.08  So maybe  Maybe they  Could raise  It  Like because  The alcohol  Is going  To be  Stronger  So maybe  They should  Allow people  To drink  A little  Bit more  While they're  Driving  Yeah  Perhaps  They should  But they  Did not  Do that  They just  Passed  This particular  Bill  Where's  Where's your  Stance  On  The  Lop  Weiser  On  But  Weiser  The  Lop  Weiser  It's  Another  German  Import  That  The kids  Today  Seem to  Be  Fancy  Very  Big  In  Florida  Yeah  Well I  Don't  Have  Any  Objection 
[02:05:00]  To  You know  I'm not  An isolationist  I  You know  I don't  Have  Any  Objection  To  Foreign  Trade  Or  Anything  Of  That  Sort  Whether  It's  Beer  Or  Any  Other  It's  Just  My  Position  I  Don't  Think  In  The  State  Of  Alabama  Any  Other  States  That  We  Should  Be  Raising  The  Content  Of  Alcohol  Beverage  I  Mean  What  We  Have  Today  Is  Fine  And  People  Enjoy  That  Hey  Alvin  We  Got  A  Lot  Of  Youngsters  That  Listen  To  The

[02:32:30]  Under  Their  Fingernails  A  Right  Is  Just  Vocal  About  It  He's  Not  He's  Not  Involved  In  An  Organization  That  Has  Shielded  Child  Fuckers  So  It's  Like  I  Don't  Care  Obama  Denounced  Him  I  Don't  Give  A  Shit  What  He  Really  Believes  You  Know  White  People  Out  Of  The  Country  It's  It's  I  Agree  With  You  On  The  Catholic  Church  And  The  Kid  Thing  That's  That's  Something  That  You  Could  Dredge  Up  When  You  Talk  About  Any  Religion  But  Here's  A  Guy  That's  Supposed  To  Be  A  Man  Of  The  Cloth  A  Man  Of  Equality 
[02:33:00]  And  Love  And  Preaching  The  Gospel  Of  Jesus  And  In  A  Lot  Of  These  Churches  It  Seems  Behind  These  Closed  Doors  There's  Separatism  And  Hatred  And  Racism  Being  Preached  And  And  Then  There's  A  Big  Problem  That  We're  Not  Getting  Along  Well  The  Fucking  Church  Ain't  Helping  It's  Not  Helping  When  You  Got  A  Reverend  Wright  Sitting  In  There  Getting  Everyone  Riled  Up  About  Whitey  Spreading  AIDS  In  The  Black  Community  And  All 
[02:33:30]  The  Other  Shit  He  Was  Saying  That  Doesn't  Help  They  Leave  The  Church  Then  With  This  Animosity  And  More  Hatred  Toward  The  White  Man  As  Meanwhile  As  History  Has  Shown  They're  Advancing  More  And  More  As  It's  Proof  Right  There  That  Obama  Is  A  Leading  Candidate  For  The  Presidency  Of  The  United  States  So  Why  Is  He  Behind  Closed  Doors  Preaching  Hate  If  A  White  Guy  Was  Doing  This 
[02:34:00]  It  Would  Be  A  Fucking  Klan  Meeting  It  Wouldn't  Be  A  Church  Service  It  Would  Be  A  Fucking  Klan  Meeting  The  Only  Thing  I'll  Disagree  With  That  Only  Because  He's  Not  Calling  For  Violence  Like  He's  Not  Like  The  Klan  He's  Historically  You  Know  Something  A  Lot  Of  The  Modern  Klan  Does  Not  Preach  Violence  Anymore  As  A  Matter  Of  Fact  They're  Saying  They're  Trying  Nonviolent  Means  Of  Separatism  It's  The  Same  Thing  As  Preaching  And  There  Is  An  Element  Of  Not  Not  A  Overt  Element  Of  Violence  But  There's 
[02:34:30]  This  Underlying  There's  The  Motherfuckers  That  Are  Fucking  Us  Kind  Of  Thing  United  As  A  People  As  A  Black  And  White  People  As  Long  As  Shit  Like  This  Goes  On  On  Both  Sides  I'll  Agree  On  Both  Fucking  Sides  But  Don't  Preach  Fucking  Victim  Don't  Play  The  Fucking  Victim  When  Your  Own  Leaders  And  Clergy  Are  Preaching  Hatred  In  Your  Fucking  Churches  He  Was  He  Was  Alive  At  A  Time  Where  I 
[02:35:00]  I  I  Don't  Know  If  He  Could  Vote  I  There  No  There  Were  Some  People  That  Weren't  Alive  When  There  Weren't  Airplanes  You  Don't  See  Them  Walking  Everywhere  Jesus  Christ  It's  It's  A  New  Day  And  Age  Get  Over  It  It  Is  But  We're  Not  Far  Enough  Removed  From  It  We're  Still  Feeling  Look  We're  Still  Feeling  The  And  I  Hate  It  Because  I'm  Living  In  It  Too  I  Hate  It  But  We  Are  Still  Feeling  The  Fucking 
[02:35:30]  The  Way  They  Said  They  Were  Going  To  Be  Done  We  Would  Not  Be  Dealing  With  This  Big  Fleet  Of  Ships  Absolutely  Our  Giant  Adios  Two  Million  People  On  The  Queen  Mary  God  Speed  No  We  Would  Not  Be  Dealing  With  This  Shit  But  It  Wasn't  So  What  Happens  Is  Those  Fucking  Jizz  Bags  That  Didn't  Do  What  They  Were  Supposed  To  Do 
[02:36:00]  Have  Now  Fucking  Push  This  Ont  Our  Plate  200  Years  Later  Or  150  Years  Later  That's  Why  We're  Still  Feeling  It  But  As  Long  As  They're  Still  Preaching  Like  This  It'll  Continue  I  Think  I  Think  I  Could  Turn  It  Around  And  Say  Well  It's  Almost  Better  That  They  Remember  Those  Days  Because  They  Could  See  The  Contrast  Of  How  Much  Better  It  Is  Now  Than  It  Was  Then  And  You  Should  Be  You  Count  Your  Blessings  Do  Do  You  Feel  Grateful  You  Were  Married  Because  You  Now  Have  A  Contrast  Comparison  To  Make  Or  Would  You  Like  To  Undo  Those  Nine

[02:37:30]  Passed  On  To  The  Next  Generation  This  Hatred  And  Having  A  Preacher  Preaching  This  Shit  It's  Perpetuating  The  Whole  Thing  It's  It's  Like  A  I  Don't  Even  Know  How  To  Describe  It  But  It's  Become  Ingrained  In  The  Culture  Passing  On  This  This  Hatred  And  Animosity  Of  Course  It's  Deserved  I'm  Not  Stupid  I  You  Know  I  Go  Off  On  This  Show  A  Lot  But  You  Know  Believe  Me  I  Do  Understand  There's  Some  Shit  To  To  Be  Angry  About  You  Know  But 
[02:38:00]  To  Perpetuate  It  Like  This  Is  I  Don't  See  Where  It's  Going  To  End  And  It  Does  No  Good  In  Uniting  Us  As  A  People  Well  I  Also  There's  A  Self  Destructive  Thing  Going  On  Because  The  NAACP  For  Them  To  Feature  This  Guy  Knowing  How  Detrimental  It  Is  To  Obama's  Campaign  It's  Like  You  Fucking  Dumb  Motherfuckers  Do  Do  You  Really  Think  That  Having  A  Black  President  Is  A  Negative  Role  Model  For  Fucking  Black  Kids  In  A  Bad  Area  All  We  Do  Is  Preach  In  America  About  How  You  Can  Do

[02:39:00]  Black  Person  Anything  They  Have  To  They're  Trying  They  Play  Both  Sides  Of  This  Of  Course  They  Support  Obama  They  Will  Want  Him  As  President  Because  A  Black  President  Would  Be 
[02:39:30]  Structive  Fucking  Vibe  It's  Like  How  About  You  Can't  Play  It  Both  Ways  No  One  Is  Saying  To  Denounce  The  Guy  And  Throw  Him  In  The  Garbage  But  How  About  You  Don't  Feature  Him  At  A  Fucking  Dinner  Yeah  When  You  Know  That  He  Is  Hurting  Obama  And  How  About  Selfish  Fucking  Jeremiah  Wright  You  Take  A break  For  Two  Months  You're  Able  To  Preach  Whatever  You  Want  To  Preach  At  Your  Pulpit  But  To  Go  On  A  Press  Thing  And  Then  Say  Shit  Like  He's  Responding  As  A  Politician 
[02:40:00]  It's  Like  I  Know  You  Want  To  Defend  Yourself  Real  Man  Of  God  To  Put  Your  Own  Fucking  Arrogance  And  Your  Ego  Pride  Your  Pride  The  Sin  Of  Pride  That's  Why  Something  Doesn't  Make  Sense  Yeah  He's  A  Prick  Believe  Me  Although  I  Do  Like  Let's  Say  Hi  To  New  York  City  Pete  Hold  On  You  Gotta  Understand  Wright  Is  Gonna  Be  Happy  As  He  Can  Be  If  Obama  Gets  Elected  The  Guy's  Been  In  His  Parish  For  20  Years  That  This  Whole  Riff  Is  A  Fake  It's  A  Scam  They  Make  Them  Believe  They 
[02:40:30]  Don't  Like  Each  Other  Everybody  Is  Buying  Into  It  He's  Going  To  Get  Elected  Pete  That's  Easy  To  Say  But  What  Is  The  End  Game  Like  It  Seems  Like  It  Would  Be  A  Pretty  Big  Risk  To  Go  Down  This  Road  Absolutely  Wrong  Pete  I'm  Gonna  Tell  You  Why  I  Would  Agree  With  You  If  He  Had  Just  Backed  Off  But  He's  Come  Out  Now  And  He's  Saying  Harsher  Things  That  He  Cannot  Write  Off  As  Things  He  Just  Said  At  The  Pulpit  Yeah  Like  These  Harsh  Things  Are 
[02:41:00]  There's  No  Upside  Dude  There's  No  Up  This  Is  Only  Obama  Is  Losing  Points  So  Your  Whole  Argument  Is  Wrong  Because  It's  Counterproductive  But  He  Will  Be  Gaining  Points  Back  By  Separating  From  Him  And  He  Would  Have  Say  Oh  Look  Obama  Did  The  Right  Thing  What  A  Great  Guy  Here's  Why  They  Would  Have  Said  That  Had  He  Separated  Immediately  And  Right  Kept  His  Mouth  Shut  Or  Just 
[02:41:30]  Said  Look  I  Say  Things  At  The  Pulpit  And  Then  Obama  Would  Have  Just  Separated  Maybe  I  Would  Agree  With  You  That  Right  Silence  Was  A  Way  Of  Helping  Obama  Get  Into  The  White  House  But  The  Fact  That  He's  Out  And  Angrily  Saying  That  That  Fucking  I  Meant  What  I  Said  And  Obama  Is  Responding  As  A  Politician  He's  Calling  Obama  A  Liar  For  Denouncing  Him  You're  Incorrect  Dude  I  Know  What  You're  Saying  I  Don't  Think  So  I  Know  You  Don't  But  I  Know  You  Don't  But  You  Are  All  Right  One  More  Pete  One  More  Point  Is  Obama  Is  Is  Pushing 
[02:42:00]  Himself  As  The  Black  Candidate  And  Everybody  Forgets  He's  Not  Black  He's  Half  Black  I  Could  Call  Myself  Yeah  Let  Fuck  Your  Daughter  And  See  Who  You  Call  Your  Friends  And  Tell  She  Fuck  Oh  My  God  All  Pete  Come  On  Just  A  Quick  Laugh  To  Calm  Everybody  What  Are  You  Gonna  Do  Call  Your  Friends  She's  Fucking  A  Half  White  Guy  Half  White  I  Got  A  Bad  Connection  I'll  Play  It  Back  Let's  Go  To  Miami  Craig  What's  Up  Hey 
[02:42:30]  Guys  Love  You  Love  You  Guys  Love  The  Show  Right  On  Let  Me  Preface  What  I'm  About  To  Say  With  The  Fact  That  I  Worked  With  A  Lot  Of  Black  Pastors  In  A  Previous  Job  And  They  Were  Great  Were  You  A  Tax  Attorney  I  Said  What  Are  You  A  Tax  Attorney  You  Can't  Write  Off  A  Silk  Hat  We  Were  In  Media  And  I  Worked  With 
[02:43:00]  A  Lot  Of  Black  Pastors  But  What  Anthony  Said  Is  So  True  I  Had  Black  Pastors  Slammed  The  Door  In  My  Face  Literally  Over  The  Phone  Was  In  A  Men's  Room  I  Was  Going  To  Take  A  Dump  I  Sorry  You  Keep  Right  Ahead  Yeah  You're  Probably  Right  I'm  Not  Saying  That  They're  Not  Racist  And  Bitter  Too  But  You  Know  I'm  Not  Saying  That  They  Know  What  To  Cater  To  Yeah  They  Know  What's  Going  To  Impassion  Their  Parishioners  And  Talking 
[02:43:30]  About  Race  Pumped  Up  And  Brings  Them  Back  Week  After  Week  That's  What  They  That's  What  They  Want  That's  What  Any  A  Priest  Reverend  Whatever  They  Want  Their  People  Coming  Back  So  That's  What  They  Know  Gets  Them  All  Fired  Up  And  Impassioned  So  They  Keep  Doing  It  It's  Counterproductive  And  It's  Good  For  Business  As  Far  As  Right  Good  For  Business  As  He  Moves  Forward  That's  Right  This  Is  What  Obama  Had  To  Say  As  He  Denounced  What  Reverend  Wright  Said  The 
[02:44:00]  Person  I  Saw  Yesterday  Was  Not  The  Person  That  I  Met  20  Years  Ago  His  Comments  Were  Not  Only  Divisive  And  Destructive  But  I  Believe  That  They  End  Up  Giving  Comfort  To  Those  Who  Prey  On  Hate  And  I  Believe  That  They  Do  Not  Portray  Accurately  The  Perspective  Of  The  Black  Church  They  Certainly  Don't 
[02:44:30]  Portray  Accurately  My  Values  And  Beliefs  Now  Right  Now  Pete  Who  Called  In  Before  Is  Going  See  He's  Making  Himself  Look  Crazy  So  Obama  Can  Distance  Himself  That  Would  Work  If  They  Had  Lunch  Once  At  The  Parker  But  He  Was  His  Spiritual  Advisor  For  20  Years  There's  No  Advantage  In  A  Presidential  To  Go  Do  You  See  That  Radical  Psychopath  That  I'm  Walking  Away  From  I  Was  With  Him  For  20  Years  There's  Thousands  Of  Pictures  Of  Us  Together  Yeah  He  Did  My  Wedding  He  Cut  The  Force  Of  My  Kid  Dick  We  Made  Hats  Out of 
[02:45:00]  It  We  Had  A few  Laughs  Fucking  He  Painted  White  Circles  Around  My  Wife's  Pupils  So  She  Looks  Like  A  South  Park  Character  This  Is  Definitely  A  Panic  Move  Obviously  By  Obama  And  If  Reverend  Wright  Thinks  That  That's  Political  Posturing  As  He  Put  It  Then  He  Doesn't  Know  Me  Very  Well  And  Based  On  His  Remarks  Yesterday  Well  I  May  Not  Know  Him  As  Well  As  I  Thought  Either  I  Gave  Him  The  Benefit  Of  The  Doubt 
[02:45:30]  In  My  Speech  In  Philadelphia  Explaining  That  He  Has  Done  Enormous  Good  In  The  Church  He  Built  A  Wonderful  Congregation  Yeah  I mean  Look  To me  That  Actually  He's  Distancing  Himself  Accurately  And  That's  What  You  Gotta  Do  There's  No  Way  Obama  Even  If  The  Guy  Preach  Radical  Shit  So  What  This  Is  Obama  Going  What  The  Fuck  Are  Doing  Like  Obviously  This  Guy  Is  So  Much  Of  A  Selfish  Cocksucker  That  Obama  Couldn't  Have  Known  Him  As  Well  As 
[02:46:00]  He  Thought  Because  Who  Would  Think  That  The  Guy  You  Put  So  Much  Trust  In  Even  Though  He  Says  Some  Shit  You  May  Or  May  Not  Agree  With  Is  Going  To  Sink  Your  Presidential  Campaign  Purposefully  Did  He  Think  But  Did  Obama  Not  Know  That  This  Guy  Was  Preaching  Like  This  I'm  Sure  He  Did  For  Years  Of  Course  He  Knew  He  Sat  There  In  His  Fucking  Church  For  20  Fucking  Years  He  Knew  This  Guy's  Agenda  But  Yeah  And  He  Continued  Going  To  The  Church  Why  Is  No  One  Faulting  Him  For  Listening  To  A  Guy  Who  Said  Yes  And  Then  He 
[02:46:30]  Was  Dead  But  Then  He  Moved  The  Rock  Once  He  Was  Dead  Yeah  But  That's  A little  Different  Than  You  Preaching  About  AIDS  And  The  War  Another  Roman  Empire  You  Know  It's  He  Absolutely  Had  To  Know  What  This  Guy's  Agenda  I'm  Sure  You're  Right  And  And  I  During  The  Election  You  Think  Right  And  The  NAACP  Just  Don't  Want  Obama  As  President  I 
[02:47:00]  Think  That  Doesn't  Help  Their  Agenda  There's  Probably  People  Like  Like  Al  Sharpton  Right  One  Guy  Right  One  Guy  The  NAACP  Is  A  Mentality  It's  A  Bunch  Of  People  Making  A  Decision  It  He  Has  This  Really  Weird  Thing  Where  You  Really  Feel  Like  Change  Can  Happen  I  Think  Kennedy  Had  That  He's  Not 
[02:47:30]  Some  Token  Black  Guy  I  Think  He's  A  Smart  Dude  I  Think  He'll  He'll  I  Think  He's  Good  For  The  Country  For  Some  Reason  I  Just  Feel  Good  About  Him  I  Don't  Know  Why  I  Like  him  But  Instead  Of  Seeing  The  Big  Picture  They  Fucking  They  Just  Can't  Help  Accomplishing  Something  With  A  Ceremony  For  A  Fucking  Word  A  Lot  Of  These  Old  Organizations 
[02:48:00]  Are  Obsolete  Now  They're  Just  Childish  Right  They  Haven't  Changed  With  The  Times  They  Haven't  Looked  At  Things  And  Reassessed  It's  I'm  Just  Looking  At  The  GTA  4  Has  Been  Doing  A  Grand  Theft  Auto  4  Story  For  The  Last  Easily  Three  Or  Four  Minutes  Know  What  They're  Saying  I  Took  A  Peek  As  You  Guys  Were  Talking  About  The  Right  Thing  Titanic  Made  601  Million  Dollars  The  First  Day  That's  Their  That's

[02:49:30]  Involved  In  AIDS  When  He  Suggests  That  Minister  Farrakhan  Somehow  Represents  One  Of  The  Greatest  Voices  Of  The  20th  And  21st  Century  When  He  Equates  The  United  States  Wartime  Efforts  With  Terrorism  Then  There  Are  No  Excuses  They  Offend  Me  They  Rightly  Offend  All  Americans  And  They 
[02:50:00]  Should  Be  Denounced  And  That's  What  I'm  Doing  Very  Clearly  And  Unequivocally  Here  Today  And  This  Is  A  Problem  With  The  Black  Community  Too  That  You  Need  To  Cut 
[02:50:30]  Get  It  Yeah  We  Get  It  Let's  Say  I  Don't  Think  I  Don't  Think  Sharpton  Really  Wants  Obama's  President  Of  Course  He  Doesn't  It  It  Advances  Black  People  And  He  Doesn't  Want  That  And  He  Will  Be  Seen  He  He  He  He  He  He  Sharpton  Is  Very  Safe  For  People  That  Don't  Truly  Want  A

[02:54:00]  Of  Squares  Run  By  Squares  Squares  On  Radio  Well  There  Were  Two  Squares  Talking  About  GTA  Take  A  Peek  At  That  Oh  Yeah  You  Got to think that they said some very relevant things  Oh I definitely want some GTA news audio  Oh yeah  Because they just don't  They just don't get it  They can go home play the game and then come back and try to bash it  It's people that might have played Miss Pac-Man back in the day  That's a fun game  We go after Pinky the ghost  Yeah no clue on the culture the gaming culture of today 
[02:54:30]  You remember in the Miss Pac-Man game how they'd get married and they'd bump into each other and they'd like the little Pac-Man baby  Oh yeah  Jimmy  Yeah  I like that it implied that the Pac-Man were fucking  That was good I like when they bump into each other and then the little Pac-Man baby fell to the bottom of the game in a big splash  That's right and then the Miss Pac-Man was crying and the Mr. Pac-Man was smoking cigars with his friends because he wouldn't have to turn his rec room into a play area 
[02:55:00]  Family came over and sopped up it looked like mustard  That's right and there were little blue dots in the corner but instead of going over there eating ghosts you had to sop them up and stop her from crying  Long way to go for a Miss Pac-Man joke  Very long  You got there though Jimmy  Thank God  Did you watch Chasing Ghosts?  Oh not yet  No I was dizzy yesterday to have my audio hooked up  I would love to give this guy credit and he's a regular but his name is escaping me right now  But he turned me on to Chasing Ghosts because I told him 
[02:55:30]  Well we talked on the show how much we loved King of Kong  And this guy called up if you're a faithful listener you probably heard  He goes oh if you like that movie you gotta check out Chasing Ghosts  Well Roland got me a copy and wow what a great movie  Way better than King of Kong because they do the whole arcade culture from the early 80s  The whole thing  And that Billy Mitchell now I'm kind of starting to like him because  He's a douche  Dude the guy though  The guy he's such a douche in King of Kong 
[02:56:00]  But in Chasing Ghosts they all say this guy is fucking unbelievable  He's the only guy that had a perfect game of Miss Pac-Man  Got every single point possible  Well yeah  He went through all 256 boards  He got every fruit that comes out  Yeah his initials are A.I.D. when he finishes the game  And when they turn into those ghosts 
[02:56:30]  Yeah  If you've ever played Miss Pac-Man  You know the first few boards you have all the time in the world to get them when they turn into ghosts  But if you play long enough those ghosts go  Their ghosts were literally eh eh and go back  Yeah  And he was able to get them before they changed back  The only person to record a perfect game of Miss Pac-Man  Can I tell you  Oh Shwoogie thank you  That's right it was Shwoogie with the deep voice  Thank you Chester's liver  I hold that in the same regard I would if you said he was the only guy to ever hold two logs of shit in his mouth 
[02:57:00]  And sing mares eat oats and doze eat oats and little lambs eat ivy  Those are equal to me  I'm more impressed with that  Of course  Jimmy you're going to enjoy the movie though  When you see it then we pass it on Anthony  We'll have a little discussion  Is Billy Mitchell in the movie?  A little bit  Not as much as King of Kong  And not as douchey as he is in King of Kong  Oh okay  Is this older or newer?  Um I think  It seems like it's older  Cause they don't acknowledge Steve Wiebe 
[02:57:30]  Who uh you know  Attempted to be the first person to  To get a million points on um  On uh Donkey Kong  Billy Mitchell is a boob  Oh boy is he  Alright we'll uh  Take a quick break  Continue  Daddy daddy daddy  Please please  Please don't kill me daddy  I want  I want  I want to live  Why are you killing us?  Wow  Is that Billy Haker?  Shut up  He deserved to burn in hell  Koopi and Anthony  Ah

[03:03:00]  I'm sorry  Get home safe  Sorry  This is Vaudeville Jim  Sorry  I should just pause  After everyone  Pause  P-A-W-S  You're a bear  Go ahead  How did you hurt your back  Besides not carrying  Production pieces  Vaudeville Jim  Goes too far  And gets his jaw shattered  Jim you need to  Give yourself a swim walk  You're on fire today  Oh no I can't  Vaudeville people  Don't swim walk  We just curse at blacks  And make them open doors  For us  I hurt my vertebrae 
[03:03:30]  Three men's chins  Were in it  Go right ahead  Done  For that one  For that line  I'm just relaxing  Okay thanks  Had an MRI  And turns out  Oh I'm gay  And turns out  You're gay  Wow  How do they get that  Through MRI  They see that  Through MRIs now  It's amazing  They took an S-ray  And they found  A belly full of semen  They said  You jiggle when you walk 
[03:04:00]  Don't you son  That's more even  Vaudeville  Matt LaFar  Matt LaFar  From Queensbury  They're all playing  The how did  Steve hurt his back  Game  And Matt writes  Carrying a rack  Full of clearance items  Out of Lane Bryant  Oh  That's mean  That's right  Had an MRI  And  It's not funny if you're expecting 
[03:04:30]  I know  Well I saw the hand go up  And you cue him  And I have three  Herniated discs in my back  Did the doctors try to read the MRA  And say we can't read  Past this watermark  MRA  MRA  MRA  MRA  Yep I am an MRA  Man's a real ass 
[03:05:00]  Oh boy  Swing and a Miss Jimbo  Get the letter on  They'll jump on you  You're going to see the face he made  As he slams his back  Alright good point  So what's the herniated disc  What does that mean  It means that I have  That  Quickly  Yeah thank you  It means that  I'm queer everyday  What really 
[03:05:30]  That's what it means  Surprisingly  It does  And it's odd that  That would have such an impact  On my  Sexual orientation  But  But it did  The  Spine is  The spine  Is made up of  Bone  Of bone  And it's compressed  And it's pushing into my spinal cord  Which is causing my right arm  To go numb  And um  So  They actually have discs  Between the  The vertebrae  Right  And um  When you have herniated one 
[03:06:00]  It kind of squishes out  It kind of squishes out  A little bit  Right  Squishes out  So the top three  In my neck  Are squished  Yes squished  So your right arm's going numb  My right arm has been going numb  For about three months  And it hits the nerves  Because you know  They're like little donuts  And there's a lot of nerves  Going through the middle of them  And out over  The tops of them  And through the  Through them  It's an amazing thing  Nerves  They're all over the place  And then when they get squished  It interrupts with the nerve  And things go numb  Like his fucking head  What can they do for you? 
[03:06:30]  Um  Well they can remove  The um  Things in the most extreme cases  And fuse the vertebrae together  Ooh  Uh  This  Who knows it  Who are you  McMars?  I know everything  Yeah  Uh  And this is uh  Very funny  Because then he'll walk around  Like Frankenstein  Oh really?  They could  Yeah  Because then you can't really  Move your neck  They could also shave them down though  What's popping out  Yeah  It depends on how extreme it is  Not the best uh  Surgery  In extreme cases  Yes  They have to operate  And either fuse the vertebrae together  Or shave them down  I have told them 
[03:07:00]  I would really appreciate it  If they didn't operate on my back  So I will entertain any  Uh  Any like  Physical therapy  Or anything that they can suggest  But you know  I'm not gonna  Any?  You don't  But you don't wanna go  Well  I know how you can stretch your back  A little bit  Oh  Oh  Uh  So today  Take it in the hiney  Put that hiney  Take it in your hiney  That's just a character  I wanna go backwards a little bit 
[03:07:30]  Jay from Florida  From uh  Whackbag writes  MRA gets uh  Vaudeville Jim  The Big Hook  That's right  Jim was having none of that today  So  So I gotta go back for an EMG test today  Which  From what I've  For the limited amount I've read  Is I guess they stick like some little needles in you  And then they try to  I think they run current through it  I'm not really sure  And um  And they  It's just further testing  To see how extensive the damage is 
[03:08:00]  When are you gonna stop obsessively working out?  Um  Well I had to actually  And then I had to  Stop obsessively  When are you gonna stop obsessively taking supplements?  That's fun  That's  That wasn't hurting my back  I'm serious  How'd you do it to your neck?  Uh  I have no idea  I really don't know  Like  Military press?  Lower  Lower back  Lower back is usually where it's at  But  I don't really know  Cause I you know  It's some exercise  That you've been straining the shit out of yourself  It was probably some back and shoulder exercise  And I thought  What I had for months  Was like these knots  That were just going unresolved 
[03:08:30]  Or like a pinched nerve  And it turned out of  They got crushed from men's teeth  Yeah  Cause you're gay  Homosexual  Yeah  Right  Horse hooves on the shoulders  He was a docile looking creature  Steve  Oh that's hilarious  Um  Yeah I thought it was something else  All clumsily teetering  there is a part in Jim's act 
[03:09:00]  that's just fucking hysterical about that  you gotta see it  of what I missed out  Jim does a thing in his act about the guy  that got fucked by the horse and got killed  and it's so fucking funny  your description of it  and the way you move  it's really fucking funny  Pittsburgh's gonna love it this weekend  Tug McGroin writes  Tug McGroin? The Tug?  he's writing as Steve  I don't want them to do surgery on my back  because my insurance doesn't cover the three days 
[03:09:30]  of shaving they'll need to  to do before the  operation  it'll look like when they operate on gorillas  but not that smart  he's just getting smashed here  poor fuckers  all fucked up  neurosurgeons are involved, MRIs or MRAs  sorry Steve  what's that thing on your arm  to help?  this is just my  it's an icy hot pet sleeve  to just distract me 
[03:10:00]  from the fact that my  that my arm  goes numb  every time I put it on the  it goes numb  yeah like when I type  or when I put my arms  like on the tip  my index finger  my forefinger  and my thumb  are completely asleep right now  and my forearm is just  Mike  the hand bone's  connected to the brain bone  where the fuck did Mike go  holy shit  Mike in Delaware  is suggesting that your arm's numb 
[03:10:30]  from all the ass to mouth  sex  what doesn't make any sense  of course not  spinal decompression  yes I went through that  thank you Mike in Brooksville  ask your chiro about spinal decompression  you know what's interesting  the doctors don't like chiropractors  and chiropractors don't like doctors  you get completely conflicting information  from the both of them  that may be true  but I wouldn't put it under the umbrella  of interesting  did I say it was interesting  he did 
[03:11:00]  oh fuck  that was the least interesting thing  I could  fuck me for prefacing  that with interesting  oh poor fucking Steve  why  you're making me feel bad  Steve might be right  but the way he set it up  stop the presses  I have a film idea  the doctor versus  the versus the chiropractor

[03:22:00]  comes in  and uh  talks about  nothing but chicks  right  and their tits  and uh  well that's his catchphrase  and their pussies  and just like  tries to be a little  too manly  when it comes to uh  talking about women  but can't get the voice  right  and the voice  is just very effeminate  the voice is very lispy  and wispy  and just very  doesn't know much  about women  except  yeah  like  you know  the basic tits  and pussy  and things like that  don't kiss more guys  okay  what  oh what was that  that was a recording 
[03:22:30]  no no  i heard it clear as day  it was uh  coming from your mic  no it was coming  from the other room  it was a recording  i didn't say that  i want to kiss more guys  oh  wow  say look  please  you must be getting  enough cock  at this point  i don't want any  you just  you know  let it be  i want to kiss more guys  yeah  oh you do  i understand  there should be a don't  in there  we all understand  don't i want to kiss more guys  no  so um 
[03:23:00]  aj poopy shits  uh  yeah  on break.com  this is how this guy  is doing aj poopy shits  what's up greg  hey cameron  so exhausted  because last night  i was begging my girlfriend  for like four hours  really  oh yeah  we did it like four or five times  it was really hot  uh-huh  and there's your girlfriend  you were doing that with  hey  yeah  of course  i was really doing  some different stuff too  we had a reverse cowgirl going  totally  this is cameron  cameron claims to be straight 
[03:23:30]  but his speech pattern  and his behavior  completely disagree  the jury's still out for me  but uh  one thing i do know  is that  he takes every opportunity  he can to establish  with masculinity  by talking about manly things  sometimes it comes off  a little forced  hey guys  did you guys see  the chargers game last night  no  missed it  oh it was a good one  cool  i love football  see ya  this is aj poopy shit  much better than aj poopy shit  oh yeah 
[03:24:00]  they actually worked on it  they actually had a concept  with the uh character  yeah it's funny  i like it a lot  it's not funny  it's an unbelievable name  he's doing the same cadence  as aj poopy shits  and everything  i know  and the narrator decided  to take the effort  to explain the entire joke  to you  in case you didn't fully understand  what was going on  right  it's called force feeding  in the business  yeah  a little spoon feeding  yeah i can men's press  like 260  yeah  it's hot  this thing is jammed again  god i love pussy 
[03:24:30]  what  i just hope he comes to terms  with everything pretty soon  because this is getting  pretty hard to deal with  talking about dick  she's probably walking  pretty tender today  yeah that's awesome man  hey i'm actually gonna  get back to work here  oh yeah it's cool  it's totally cool  i'm probably just gonna  take off then  cool  i love john wayne movies  yeah they're pretty good  all right  later greg  sad  how great would this be  if aj poopy shits 
[03:25:00]  actually ripped off this guy  and now we're discovering  oh i know  exactly  because a few people  are saying that this  is part of a series  that's been on the internet  for a while now  listen as bad as aj  i am not a fan of aj poopy shits  and never have been  sure his new bit  lonely sam 15  that was obviously a rip off  of aj poopy shits  it wasn't funny  it wasn't good  no  it was terrible  but what if it  predates aj poopy shits 
[03:25:30]  exactly what if  i don't think it does  that's right  i don't like your new song  either  vanilla rain  should have quit  while i was ahead  shouldn't i  lonely sam was pretty good  someone's saying that  norton knows this guy  his name is joe howard  he's from cleveland  joe howard  do you know joe howard  what do you mean  moe howard  because i fucked a few  girls with his haircut  i might know joe the name is 
[03:26:00]  familiar but then again joe's a  common name and so is howard  yeah  hey speaking of internet  sensations like uh what you just  heard has anyone else  this is gonna be a bit hack i  understand  but has anyone else seen the uh  the two-year-old singing um  hey jude  um no  i heard a german yelling  something similar  a little comedy called  schindler's list  yeah 
[03:26:30]  put this on the big screen  how do we get the audio up  you know people are gonna think  oh why are they doing cute radio  i understand but listen how  this fucking kid sings hey jude  perfectly  listen  hey jude  don't make it fast  hey  can't  dance  and make it  better  kid sucks  remember 
[03:27:00]  to run her  into your heart  run her into your heart  and start  to make it  better  oh  nice mullet on him  remember  remember  to run her into your heart  then you can start  to make it  back  kids 18 
[03:27:30]  how old is this kid  the timing is bizarrely  perfect  as the kid just  shits himself  you're still  shitting yourself  exactly  be funny if you start  fucking a one-legged baby  and his other baby friend  got shot  and the other one gets  putting in his head  oh i thought of george  harrison yesterday  i saw the mr softly truck  with the ice cream  coming through the head 
[03:28:00]  i thought of you  like george harrison  oh god  nice  that was yoko  yeah really  yeah  but you gotta see  the visual  the guy  the kid is  in diapers  he can't be more  than 18 months old  that's not impressive  though  how fucked up is that  how did they find it 
[03:28:30]  on break  and all those other  sites there  asian baby sings  hey jude  wow i really  fucking sum it up  for you  that's pretty much  it  make it very easy  yes iraq  while you were  playing this  pat duffy's in the  back complaining  that he handed in  this radio gold  two months ago  and  with the hey jude  yeah  and uh  he was upset  that it wasn't used  well tell him we  probably didn't look at it  because he was  rubbing human shit  on his face  yeah how can we  take that guy  seriously  with all the shit  on his face  if tony brought it 
[03:29:00]  we might pay attention  absolutely  on high alert  if you walked in with it  it's tony the producer  and pat the toilet  and that's how we like it  oh look  he's gotta come in  and what  offend yourself  eric told you to come in  i love when that happens  then we just tell you  to get lost  i wasn't complaining  i just said that  i found this  and i was told it was  too racist to play  on the other side  too racist  too racist  no it's not racist  who said it was racist  who said that  i believe that was you  saying it was too much  it was asian  too much  i said it was a visual  i didn't say it was racist  the kid's asian  not a 
[03:29:30]  okay  i think that's too racist  okay  why are they bleeping xm  shut up  patty you um  you and tony gotta settle  this thing not today  obviously because tony's  not here  but we like to have  we like to work this stuff out  are you guys gonna have  a shit match  uh  a shit off  i don't think he's that  dedicated  so  shay tony's soft  a little bit  figures he's not here today  he doesn't have the level  of commitment  as i do  you're crazy  i think pat 
[03:30:00]  fucking duffy's a problem  yeah i like pat though  could he be  very soft spoken  but i think this guy  is an animal  when he needs to be  yeah what tipped you off  the fact that he fucking  he put shit in his mouth  and brushed his teeth with it  what subtle hint did you  pick up on  that there's something  wrong with this kid  when he ate the puke  of a fat man  did that intuition  light up in your head  and go  this is not normal  this boy  i started getting  inkling with the  homeless uh  diaper thing  finally  very  fucked you jimmy 
[03:30:30]  well no you should have  been a detective  you know when i saw him  eat five gallons of puke  i said this kid is weird  i just feel that  i'm not very soft spoken  i just feel that  whenever i'm in front  of a live microphone  i tend to freeze up  a little bit  but you want to be  on the radio  i do yeah  that could be a problem  i know but i figure  be in front of a dead mic  but no one will hear it  right  but more practice  so i'm sure i'd get  more comfortable  okay  that was a hint by the way  a little more practice  so i'll get comfortable  that's duffy's way of saying  you're underutilizing me  i didn't say that 
[03:31:00]  well you meant it  is that what you really think  no not at all  okay  what  just tell them  the budding radio pro  to talk right into the mic  sorry  see  i need so much more  you want to see  another asian thing  on youtube  put in um  oh shit  here we go  m-r-i  uh-huh  oh  r-i-a-n  m-r-i  i  m-r-i  r-i-a-n

I like Vaudeville Jimmy, by the way.  I think that has potential.  Vaudeville Jimmy.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  You know what's interesting?  The doctors don't like chiropractors, and chiropractors don't like doctors. 
[03:41:30]  You get completely conflicting information from the both of them.  That may be true, but I wouldn't put it under the umbrella of interesting.  The umbrella of interesting is fucking the key to that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  You're a funny man.  Oh, thank you.  Another runner-up line of the day.  He went through all 256 boards.  He got every fruit that comes out.  Wow, who's the angel?  Oh, swim walk. 
[03:42:00]  That's great.  Another runner-up line of the day.  You have an infant with a circle and a line through it.  You know, Anthony, that's a big day.  That's what that 5'11 boot's for.  Any oopsies.  Leave a little maraschino cherry on the floor.  That's so uncalled for.  Of course it was.  You can't talk about a boot without turning into a fucking spontaneous abortion. 
[03:42:30]  Miscarriage or something.  Hey, how many views is Travis's dumb dog video up to?  1,950 more than you should have.  It better be 5.  1,900.  The thing's moving.  Hey, look up breastfeeding on YouTube.  Crazy.  Tons of people putting babies suck in their mom's tits.  Are you kidding me?  I got to see that.  Just for educational purposes, of course. 
[03:43:00]  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  He would pack the boy's shit full of heroin and balloons.  With his fat dick.  And tiny scrotum.  His shriveled HDH scrotum.  Clear one down.  Fuck, Jimmy.  Forgot about the Hulkamaniac.  Frequently asked questions.  How often should I breastfeed my baby? 
[03:43:30]  I don't know.  Whenever he bites your tits.  Stupid.  God, the graphics on the screen are way too low.  Oh, boy.  Young mother.  A lot of experts will tell you.  Put the baby in the oven.  I know.  Be like Luca Brasi in the book.  I have this number.  I don't know why they have a number.  It doesn't really matter.  The schedule is a bad idea.  Shut up.  If you have a schedule, you're not going to be listening to your baby's cues.  They're trying to make this educational just so that she can get a top one.  Yeah, pull out that fucking tit. 
[03:44:00]  May I fast forward?  Yes.  All right.  Pull out your feet, slut.  You know, a normal spacing that you're used to.  This sucks.  But you have to just let your baby ask for the milk when you find it.  Who doesn't know that?  Yeah.  When he sends you an email or his lawyer calls you, I'm cunt.  And you don't learn to say how much you have at any given time.  Also, if you're hot, you're baby and you are going to be sweating.  He might want your clit and your nipple.  If you're hot, your kid's going to turn into a fat boy. 
[03:44:30]  That was nothing.  Wait a minute.  You got two seconds of a still.  I love the fact that he's grabbing one, too.  Oh, he is.  He's crimping it up.  As soon as that happens.  Oh, wait.  This broad never takes him out?  No.  Then click off this kid.  Get one where she pulls it out.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Now your fertilizer.  Just a rotting thing with a yellow bandana on his head.  When did your little jaw drop?  That's terrible. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, he's wrestling at Wembley.  Oh, look at this.  Look at that veiny fit.  Look at this veiny breath.  Holy shit.  What happens?  How about showing the nip and the hard dick of the cameraman?  Fuck, I don't want educational breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding.  Are we really watching breastfeeding babies?  Yeah.  Oh, look at that nipple.  That's nice.  Oh, fucking A.  Get the kid out of there.  He's ruining everything.  How can I jerk off with him in there?  That's disturbing.  It's not disturbing.  It's a big fat feeding nipple. 
[03:45:30]  It was as long as your pinky.  Hang your head on it.  You know something?  Let me tell you something.  This isn't fucking beautiful, ladies.  Breastfeeding is not this beautiful thing.  It looks silly.  It looks silly.  What's beautiful is it looks like this.  Oh, God.  Look at that chewed out fucking nipple.  What are they showing?  Oh, now it's squirting milk.  It's fucking red.  It looks like a dog's dick.  Right.  You're right. 
[03:46:00]  It looks like a dog dick.  Look at her gut hanging out under it.  The baby's resting on this woman's gut.  It's awful.  She looks a little old to me.  Oh, wow.  What is that?  In a bathtub?  In a tub?  Just cut the shit.  All right.  Here we go.  Give the kid a fucking pat.  Pat is a little ribbon.  It's just fucking disgusting.  Breastfeeding videos rule.  But it does bond you with the mother.  I was breastfed as a boy.  Whatever.  I wasn't.  Worked out well.  I paid to have women's shit on me.  You know how awful it is when that one bombs and just becomes a fact? 
[03:46:30]  No, it was.  It just became like a, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  That went from kind of an attempt to be funny, just to sad and lonely.  To like, hmm, yeah.  Give me more breastfeeding videos.  And where are we up to?  Another runner-up?  No, not fucking French Bulldog versus Turtle.  Please, no.  Runner-up line of the day.  Here we go.  Another one.  Oh, this is line now.  Oh, line of the day.  Oh, okay.  That was it?  Wow.  All right.  Danny, got it.  There we go.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  AshleyMadison.com, thank you. 
[03:47:00]  Here is your line of the day.  Here.  Here comes the light of the day.  Light of the day.  Light of the day.  So Obama is pushing himself as the black candidate, and everybody forgets he's not black.  He's half black.  I could call myself Chinese.  Yeah, let him fuck your daughter and see who you call your friends and tell them she's fucking  Newell. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, but that old one.  All right.  That's cool.  That's very funny.  The second part of that was really funny, too.  With the cell phone breaking up?  No.  Yeah, yeah.  He's half white.  Yeah, half white and half my cell phone's breaking up.  Very funny, Jimmy.  You know, one more time, because we had so much fun with this little audio, and we're  going to make people sick of it, but that won't be the first time. 
[03:48:00]  That legislature from Alabama.  Yeah, what's wrong with the beer we got?  I mean, the beer we got drank pretty good, don't it?  I ain't never heard nobody complain about the beer we have.  It drank pretty good.  Budweiser.  What's the name of some of them other beers?  Budweiser and what is it?  Miller.  Miller.  Cool.  Cool.  It drank pretty good, don't it?  There you go. 
[03:48:30]  Jimmy, tickets for the HBO show you're doing.  Yes.  Free.  Free tickets.  All you have to do is do a little email thing.  Yes, Jim Norton's show at broadwayvideo.com.  It's May 21, 22, in New Jersey, in Inglewood.  I'm hosting an HBO stand-up comedy show, and there's two nights, and whichever night you  come, you get to see two episodes taped.  It's a half-hour show.  It's me and some edgy comics, and I think it's going to be a great fucking show.  I'm really, really psyched.  So, please come, because I want to have this done in Jersey. 
[03:49:00]  Yes.  I want to do East Coast.  They want to do it in L.A.  And you said, go fuck yourself.  No, I didn't.  I said, can I fly Continental?  But then I did kind of push to get it, so I gave radio fans there.  Yeah.  Nothing worse than a polite L.A. audience.  So, hopefully you guys will come out, man.  To what?  To that taping.  We don't have an answer.  To what?  Jimmy goes to Plugs these days, and we just start texting.  I don't blame you.  The more you text, the more I'll repeat it.  Believe me, if you two both just dozed off right now, fucking Fez would have to drag me 
[03:49:30]  out of the studio.  I'd still be plugging.  Hey.  Hey.  All right, y'all.  It was fun today.  By the way, if Lily's listening, I dare you to tinkle on me.  Just throwing that out there.  Would you do it for the show?  No.  She wouldn't do it.  She wouldn't.  She would.  Lily?  You might get, you know, she's an odd one.  Sometimes she does things you wouldn't expect.  Yeah, but pissing on a person is probably not one of those things.  She might piss on you.  I think she'll do it.  I feel silly.  I don't think she wants to be naked in front of us, but if we could set up in such a way, 
[03:50:00]  she'll do it.  If she won't, I'm kind of thinking Dave would.  Yeah.  What about Dave?  It's been a while.  Fucking Lily.  She'd have that hat and scarf.  She wouldn't let me see her body.  She'd probably pee into like a funnel somehow.  It would hang at the bottom of her leg.  Like a fucking...  She'd just piss down her foot.  Like a cancer patient.  I'd have like a tube hanging out.  Like fucking Culverickson, born on the 4th of July.  She'd just wave a little rubber hose over me.  That's hot.  Wee wee hose. 
[03:50:30]  We're going to end with this.  We got an instant feedback here.  You know, because we're watching some fine YouTube videos.  We want to turn you on to one more.  This guy is suggesting we go to watching video on the radiosucks.com.  What is it called?  Wait a minute.  I think that was an insult.  No, no, no.  It's an actual coincidence.  All right.  We're just babbling.  From Ron and Fez Noon to Tree.  Right.  Are on Pat Duffy.
