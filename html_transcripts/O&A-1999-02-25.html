<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a recap of their previous night at Caroline's Comedy Club.  They detailed Stephen Lynch's performance, highlighting a promised on-air rendition of his necrophilia song, and the success of their "Dice" bit. They noted the absence of their guest, "Old Dirty," but recounted bringing Black Earl and Ben ("Ben the Fag") onstage, culminating in Earl flashing his black underwear to an audience member.  The hosts then shifted to their frustrations with new drunk driving laws in Nassau and Suffolk counties.  They announced a Billy Joel concert cancellation and promoted a Guitar Center appearance by Matt Devote, who would be taking the subway due to the show's lack of reliable transportation â€“ a point they used to humorously contrast their situation with other radio stations, even recounting nearly hitting Black Earl with their car.

Next, the show reviewed the Grammy Awards, offering crude and sexually explicit commentary on various performers and presenters, including Rosie O'Donnell, Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Celine Dion, and Madonna.  This segued into breaking news: the Greaseman's indefinite suspension from his Washington D.C. radio job for an insensitive comment about Lauryn Hill, referencing the recent murder of James Byrd Jr.  The hosts discussed the Greaseman's history of controversial statements and his recurring pattern of offensive remarks.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on a segment dedicated to listener-submitted ethnic jokes.  The hosts explicitly encouraged callers to share offensive jokes targeting various groups, including Irish, Italian, Jewish, Black, Mexican, and Puerto Rican communities, framing it as a commentary on perceived political correctness. This segment included discussions of other public figures facing backlash for insensitive comments, such as Matthew McConaughey and Jesse Ventura, and further explored the ongoing tension between freedom of speech and public sensitivity. The show concluded with a radiothon plug for children's charities.


A later segment detailed a prank where they falsely announced the death of the Boston mayor. They discussed the ensuing fallout, including the mayor's family's reaction, the mayor's press conference to confirm his survival, and the extensive media coverage, drawing comparisons to the Joey Buttafuoco situation. They claimed the prank was intended as satire of other stations' April Fool's Day stunts.  This transitioned into another segment of listener-submitted ethnic jokes, explicitly pushing back against political correctness.  Numerous jokes targeting various ethnic groups, sexual orientations, and religious figures were shared, with active encouragement and participation from the hosts. This segment also featured a bit from producer Rick, discussion about Bill Clinton's then-recent accuser, and speculation about a potential new Giuliani law on punishing rapists. The segment continued with more listener-submitted jokes, interspersed with discussions about political correctness and public reaction, concluding with a confusing advertisement for a computer fair.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Aaaaahhhhhh  When I go  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York, Metallica  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Brother Page from Garage Inc,  Bruce Springsteen before that from Born & Rudd,  She's the one, and lonesome George Thorogood as well.  Good afternoon, it's Opie and Anthony!  Hey!  And I guess we gotta start off by saying hi to everyone. 
[00:00:30]  We met at Caroline's last night.  What a blast.  A huge crowd came down to see Stephen Lynch perform all his ditties,  all the songs you've heard here on our radio program.  And it was just a lot of fun.  Yeah, what a great time.  Stephen Lynch, the legend now, I think we should call him.  Mark our words, he's going to be huge.  Yeah.  He's going to get an unbelievable cult following.  It's obvious.  Yes, you don't get the subtleties when you hear them on the air.  No.  That you do at the live show.  Very entertaining.  Yes.  The facial expressions really make the songs even better. 
[00:01:00]  And he broke out a few songs we've never heard before.  I thought I heard every Stephen Lynch song.  Yeah, I like the one about the making love to the dead girl.  That was good.  That was really good.  Classic Lynch.  So Stephen said next time he comes in, he'll do that one for us.  Great.  Whenever that will be.  Good.  But a big hi to everyone.  It was a late night for the boys.  They took care of us over there, too.  Yes, they did.  Very nice place.  And Dice was a huge hit of Caroline's last night.  Oh, well. 
[00:01:30]  Had to make an appearance, of course.  The Dice Man.  Holy crap.  It was Dice-a-mania.  Like Beatle-mania.  They were really into it.  It was funny.  It was really funny.  I don't think one real joke came out, though.  They all just ended in B-Gee-Gee-wee.  Yeah.  And I want to know what happened to Old Dirty.  Old Dirty didn't show.  Our new pal, who came down here a couple days ago with the 40s, and we hung out and got  drunk on the air.  We hooked him up with some free tickets, and he probably scalped him out front. 
[00:02:00]  I wouldn't be surprised if he did.  But Old Dirty, if you're listening, you know, you've got to check in and tell us where the  hell you were last night.  What happened?  Maybe he got arrested.  A lot of people wanted to know, you know, what you look like and stuff.  Yeah.  They were asking about you.  Mm-hmm.  And then at one point, we brought Black Earl and Ben the Fag on stage.  Yes.  It was very funny.  People were a little confused as to which one was which, but we straightened that one  out.  Yes.  And then we were explaining why we call Black Earl Black Earl.  And we said, look, because he's dressed in black.  And then someone from the crowd started screaming, what about his underwear? 
[00:02:30]  So Earl didn't disappoint.  Showed everyone his black underwear.  Yeah.  He even has black underwear.  Who knew that?  I was convinced it was going to be white.  Did you know that?  That he wore black underwear?  No, I did not.  I didn't have a clue.  So.  He completely is Black Earl.  There you go.  A lot of fun, though.  And thanks for coming out.  We're going to do that again.  We got to do that again.  It was just too much fun.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Just getting started here.  We're going to definitely need your help today.  Yes.  It was a long night.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:03:00]  So we're going to need the audience participation today.  There's many ways you can do it.  You can fax us, 212-957-WNEW.  The instant feedback, all set and ready to go.  Just go to the NEW website.  Click on our pictures, and you'll know when, you know, where to go from there.  You see what a puss I was last night when we were hanging out at the bar?  People saying, you know, you want to do a shot?  I'm like, I can't.  It was the first time I saw you turn down alcohol.  I hate this whole.  I forgot about that.  I forgot about that.  Giuliani thing with this take in the car. 
[00:03:30]  And now Nassau County, too.  I got to drive through two battle zones.  Yeah.  I was really surprised.  You know, when I was driving home, and I had a few beers, but by that point I hadn't  had any in maybe an hour, because I had just stopped drinking.  It was terrible.  So I'm driving through Nassau County, and I see, like, the Suffolk County state line  come up.  I felt like the Great Escape.  Like I was Charles Bronson in the Great Escape trying to get out of Germany.  You made it. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  And then I made it.  I'm like, well, at least if they nail me, I can keep my vehicle.  You know that's going to change.  Oh, of course.  Suffolk County does everything Nassau County does.  So, well, it's the popular thing, so they got to do it.  And Jersey, stop laughing at us, because they're coming your way, too.  You watch.  What a mess.  So, yeah.  So last night I had to, you know, sit there, and I couldn't even partake in the drive-home  beer.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  The times, they are changing.  Yes, they are.  As Mr. Dillon penned many years ago. 
[00:04:30]  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Celebrity skin from Hull.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, I guess we've got to pass this along.  Billy Joel's show is canceled tonight.  Oh, really?  He was supposed to play the Continental Airline Arena, but he snowed in on the east end of  Long Island, so he's not going to make it.  Oh, he was?  The rescheduled date for this concert is Tuesday, April 20th.  All tickets for tonight's concert will be honored on April 20th.  Oh, geez.  Good thing they'll be honored. 
[00:05:00]  I don't want to lose those tickets.  Black Crow is also playing tonight, as we all know.  And you've got a chance to win some tickets to see the Black Crows.  This is pretty cool.  Come see Matt Devote at Guitar Center today at 6 p.m., 46th and North Boulevard in Long  Island City.  Matt's got a pair of tickets and a limo ride to the show, plus a chance to win $10,000.  Whoa.  Whoa.  I was talking to Matt just before we went on the air.  He's bitching and complaining, because Matt and Earl have to jump on a subway to get to 
[00:05:30]  their appearance.  Pretty pathetic, isn't it?  It certainly is.  Other radio stations in this town, they have, what, four or five vehicles?  Mm-hmm.  They got Hummers and urban assault vehicles and all sorts of stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  We got a crappy old van that's falling apart, and the van has to go to the Black Crows show  tonight at the Beacon.  So they've got to take the subway.  So there's no vehicle for Matt's appearance today at Guitar Center.  Oh. 
[00:06:00]  So Earl and him will be on the subway.  There they are.  Earl, are you going on the subway with Matt?  You going to Guitar Center?  Yes, I am.  Why don't you guys have a vehicle to drive you down there?  Welcome to CBS.  There's one vehicle.  One.  Just the van.  Little van.  God.  And Ben gets it.  Ben should have, like, a...  We should.  We should have a big motorhome type thing, you know?  Really make a statement.  Hang on for a buggy.  Hey, by the way, Earl, did you see me beeping at you on 57th? 
[00:06:30]  That was me, beeping like a maniac.  Hey, I was beeping, too.  You saw him as well?  Yeah, yeah.  You were behind me, right?  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, because I passed Earl, and I was beeping, and you weren't even looking.  You were the one that cut me off?  No, I was going the other direction.  Earl, everyone was cutting you off.  You go, like, five miles an hour.  What's up with that?  Jennifer's my witness.  I was out of control.  Earl's the guy.  He's always the guy in the way.  I saw everyone passing you getting really ticked off. 
[00:07:00]  That is not true, Earl.  It is true.  Don't you know how to drive in the city?  Yes, I do.  You put the pedal to the floor, and you go.  There's no gaps between vehicles.  Those livery cabs kept cutting me off.  You can't give them the opportunity.  If they can cut you off, you left them the opportunity.  Yeah.  You've got to stick to the bumper in front of you.  That's right.  Oh.  And I was beeping, and you were probably paranoid.  I don't know what you were doing.  Because I did the same thing.  I was probably a minute in front of you, and I was beeping at him. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  Oh, Earl.  We've got to give you driving lessons.  And then again, I had the radio up way too loud.  Oh, what station were you listening to?  Us.  Actually, I take that back.  I had a tape on.  I wasn't listening to us on the way home.  Stop it.  Be nice.  All right.  Well, you guys have fun today.  All right.  Yeah, we're giving away money.  I know.  Is that cash?  Someone's going to walk away with $10,000, or how does that go?  Well, we're going to have this big vat of guitar picks. 
[00:08:00]  Okay.  And all of them will be the same color, except one.  You have to reach in.  You pick the magic pick.  You get the $10,000.  Awesome.  Okay.  That's happening once again with Matt Devote, Guitar Center.  Today at 646th and North Boulevard in Long Island City.  All right.  Great.  We got the wrong address for Guitar Center.  What?  Hey, what's up?  Hi. 
[00:08:30]  You guys got the wrong address for the Guitar Center.  What's the real address?  48th Street, Northern Boulevard.  It's about two blocks from my house.  All right.  48th and North Boulevard.  Yeah.  Okay.  It was written down wrong.  I'm sorry.  Oops.  Thanks for calling in.  Okay.  All right.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York with the scorpions, I almost said.  Hello.  Wake up.  I'm out, babe.  Wake up.  It's Creed from their debut CD, My Own Prison.  Song called One.  We told you right off the bat that we're a little shaky today. 
[00:09:00]  We had a late night at Caroline's.  Yeah.  Oof.  You know, we were talking about the show with Stephen Lynch and everything.  We got to give props to the other comedians, too.  Pete Correale was great.  Jordan Rubin was great.  I laughed my ass off.  This guy, Jordan Rubin, was making me laugh hard.  Yeah.  Half the crowd really didn't get his sarcasm and stuff.  But that's okay.  And then, of course, Anthony's boyhood pal.  Joe Curry.  Joe Curry.  Great job.  Yeah.  We had a blast last night.  Yeah, we really did. 
[00:09:30]  Very good.  And so I had to tape the Grammys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I watched it this morning.  What a thrill.  What a thrill.  Yeah, it was a great show, huh?  Fantastic, Opie.  Boy, it wasn't a surprise who was going to win the next award, huh?  Yeah, there seemed to be a trend.  They took the whole surprise out.  If you performed, you won the next award.  True.  So they took that fun out of it.  Well, Opie, it was the year of the woman, Opie.  Are you sick of hearing that? 
[00:10:00]  Grammy Awards last night in Hollywood, the year of the woman.  And many of the top women in music walking off at the honors.  Did any guys win?  I don't even...  Yeah, Lenny won.  But as I look at the list, Brian Central Orchestra won.  But mostly, all the ladies won.  Yeah.  Rosie O'Donnell, I mean, horrible.  Her jokes were horrible.  She's much more talented than that.  Her jokes were so flat.  Yeah, they were those award show jokes. 
[00:10:30]  And these people are supposed to be performers and artists and stuff.  Enough with, let's write them a cute little script when they're presenting an award.  It's just not working anymore on the award show.  You know?  It worked in the 50s before people knew what TV was about.  Yeah, you got Jennifer Lopez up there with Jerry Seinfeld.  That could be some fun interaction.  But they both look stiff.  Jerry's reading off the teleprompter.  You know?  Hey, I'd like to get into that ass. 
[00:11:00]  They did nothing.  Nothing.  What else can we say about the Grammys?  Let's see.  Foxy Brown.  Yeah.  Nicest cans of the night.  Very nice.  Beautiful.  Incredible.  Lauryn Hill looks stupid reading from the Bible.  What about that...  What's her name?  Ergie Cack Badu.  What was her name?  Oh, Badu.  With that big thing on her head.  What the hell is she smuggling in that thing, man?  It looked like the alien from Independence Day, didn't it? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, it did.  Like, had those arms coming out of the top and everything.  She's got, like, this big piled up hair wrapped in this white cloth.  And she got those big-ass alien eyes.  Yeah.  So...  Wacky looking.  Celine Dion, go away.  Can someone punch her in the face?  Sick of the damn Titanic song.  Oh, my God.  Tonight, tonight, I sing this song for the survivors of the mighty Titanic. 
[00:12:00]  May their stories go on forever.  Forever.  Do her accent, dude.  Do it better.  Come on.  You were doing it before.  You were really pouring it on.  Tonight, I sing this song.  The survivors.  The survivors of the mighty Titanic.  May their stories go on forever.  May I cash in on their deaths forever.  Exactly. 
[00:12:30]  Don't let it fool you.  She's made so much money off that song.  You know?  The happiest person in the world, that thing went down.  Let's see.  What else can we say about the Grammy?  Shania Twain.  Wow.  Yeah.  Lovely outfit.  Your song blew, but I was looking at your body the whole time you performed.  Every time I see her on the screen, I just think of that one thing.  She puts the, in country.  Go on.  You've heard that joke, right?  Oh, no.  I haven't.  I want you to explain it for everyone.  Well, see.  You take the two syllables. 
[00:13:00]  You're a mess.  Oh, sorry.  What else?  Madonna?  Is it time for her to get a new, like, look?  Yeah, I don't know.  That whole thing's getting old, too.  So.  It was just a boring show.  And then you got DJ Jazzy Jeb with the Fresh Prince there with his son.  Always.  Every two seconds, you got to hear him about his kid.  He's got to talk about his kid.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  In school, and he's failing rhyming.  All right.  Great.  What a wonderful song he did.  Daddy loves you.  Daddy loves you.  Yeah.  Like, all right, enough already about your kid.  And then what happened with Aerosmith?  They had a problem on stage.  Yeah, the mixing board went down or something.  Went down, so Steven Tyler, like, walked to the side of the stage so he could hear the  band and stuff?  Yeah.  Was that what was going on there?  Yeah, some kind of monitor mix.  I felt bad for him.  Because I was really looking forward to seeing those guys perform.  Yeah.  But it still sounded good.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  Why couldn't it go out when, you know, other people are performing?  Ugh.  NSYNC or something.  Yeah.  All right.  There's our Grammy rap.  Oh, great.  Great to see Brandy and Monica together again, too.  Yeah, it's good to see that they're getting along these days, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, could you two just, like, start doing things to each other?  That would hold my interest.  All right.  Got anything to add to this mess today?  Give us a call.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. 
[00:14:30]  Pink Floyd, comfortably dumb.  Oh.  Hey, thank you, Anthony.  You get the wacky horn open.  Like, matchbox 20 before that, 3 a.m.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yes, we're hanging.  We're having fun.  And there you go.  If you got anything to add, give us a call.  Well, we got some breaking news out of Washington.  Look at that, huh?  You guys may remember the Greaseman.  The Greaseman Show.  We'll be back with more of the Greaseman Show. 
[00:15:00]  Yaddle-daddle-doodle-day.  Remember that experiment on K-Rock a few years back?  Ouch.  Well, the Greaseman was suspended from his latest radio job in Washington.  Suspender-oonie.  Yaddle-daddle.  Yaddle-daddle-day.  The Greaseman, I've been suspended-day.  Well, the Greaseman was suspended from his job in Washington indefinitely without pay for remarks he made on his show yesterday.  Now, check this out. 
[00:15:30]  During the 7 o'clock hour in the morning, he played a portion of a song by the Grammy winner, Lauryn Hill.  And after he played this little snippet of her song, he said on the air,  No wonder people drag them behind trucks.  Ah!  Oh, check, please.  Check, please.  What the hell is he thinking?  Yeah.  Yaddle-daddle-day.  No wonder people drag them behind trucks.  Yeah.  Yaddle-doodle-day.  What is he on, crack? 
[00:16:00]  I think he's a bitter man.  I guess so.  This business will do it to you, but...  So, they suspended him indefinitely without pay.  Yeah, that remark made reference, of course, to the brutal torture and death in Texas of James Byrd Jr.,  who died while being dragged behind a pickup truck, driven by John William King, who was convicted of murder this week.  Uh, the Greaseman also got in trouble back in 1986 for making insensitive remarks about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Uh-oh. 
[00:16:30]  Remember what he said about that?  Greaseman, are you in the studio?  What did you say about that back in, uh, 1986?  I don't understand why people are so angry, yeah.  All I said was, kill far more and we'll get the whole week off, eh.  Yaddle-doodle-day.  Yeah.  He did, he said that and got, um, got suspended for that.  In 1986.  They keep taking him back.  Yes, they do.  God, we just said the mayor was dead and they booted our asses right out of there, huh?  Yeah, I don't understand how that works. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  Wow.  We say the mayor of Boston died and we get fired.  Weedle-le-le-le.  Yeah, next time I'll goof on the chinks, eh.  Weedle-le-le.  Yeah.  Hey, what would you call me, Fred Flintstone, if he was black?  What?  Blah, blah, negra.  Weedle-le-le.  What a mess.  We'll be back with more of the Greaseman show. 
[00:17:30]  Or maybe we won't, eh.  Uh, I gotta get some Lauryn Hill on the air for, uh, the Greaseman today.  Yadda-doodle-le.  You wanna hear more Lauryn Hill?  The little brown sugary.  Yadda-doodle-le.  What is he thinking?  He's on crank, man.  At least I didn't goof on the Polacks, eh.  Yadda-doodle-le.

[00:22:30]  That's Guitar Center  Cold heart cash  Cold heart  Mmm, mmm  Cash  Topi and Anthony  Hey  There's an interesting story about Matthew McConaughey  Matthew McConaughey  Well, I mean, this world is getting way, way too politically correct  Where you really can't say anything  You've got to watch every word you say  Well, an Asian-American group is condemning actor Matthew McConaughey  For using a racial slur on the Rosie O'Donnell show 
[00:23:00]  McConaughey made the remark while talking about a World War II movie that he's filming in Italy  O'Donnell asked about his short hair and the actor responded by saying  I'm over in Rome fighting Germans and Japs from World War II  Okay, so what's the problem?  The head of the Media Action Network for Asian Americans says the term Jap has historically been used to dehumanize an entire race of people  The non-profit group is asking for an apology from McConaughey  I'm sorry, I should have said nips  Well, that's what they were called 
[00:23:30]  That's historical  They were called Japs in World War II  During the war  During the war  And Germans were the Jerry's  Or the Krauts  And Japs were the...  The Japanese were Japs or nips  As they were called also  And he's filming a period piece  Right  Basically about World War II  What, he's going to be politically correct as he films this movie?  People like to forget history sometimes, I guess  And then...  You know?  And there's another example of this as well 
[00:24:00]  You see Jesse Ventura on Letterman the other night?  No, I missed that  He's just a riot, that guy  But he's talking about Minnesota  I don't remember exactly how it went  But he was talking about the difference between Minnesota and St. Paul or something like that  Yeah  And he said St. Paul, the roads are all screwed up  And he thinks the reason the roads are all screwed up  Because the drunken Irishman built the roads  Oh my goodness  He said that  Something like that  I'm paraphrasing, obviously 
[00:24:30]  Oh, wow  So now they're all pissed at the body  At the body  And he meant it as a joke  Yeah, well, it's very hard to say  To tell any kind of racially oriented jokes, Hopi  But everyone needs to just lighten up  No, there's groups now  There's groups, action groups  And they have letterhead  And there's a group for everything  And if they don't jump on it when somebody makes a joke  Then they'd be shirking their responsibility to their people  To their peeps  Exactly  And how much fun would the world be? 
[00:25:00]  People ought to definitely lighten up  So what?  People make Italian jokes  I don't care  You know something?  There's a whole big thing about a series that's on HBO  The Sopranos  Yeah  I watched that  It's a great show  It's hysterical  It's violent  It's just great  And these Italian groups are going  It's insulting to Italians  That the stereotype of mobsters has to be  You know something?  I am 100% Italian  I'm not offended by it 
[00:25:30]  I don't even think twice  It's a show  And they're showing mobsters  So what?  Open up the paper when there's a mob bust  There's not, you know, Smiths and Joneses in there  No, it's not  You know, Jimmy the Fish Jadruzzi  And, you know, it's loosely based on reality  Every stereotype has its basis in fact  Yeah, loosely, but  Yeah, sure  Some of them a little tighter than others  Some of them aren't as loose 
[00:26:00]  And, of course, the Italians have a history of organized crime  In New York, especially  So  It's life  It's real  You know, people put their head in the sand sometimes  They don't want to accept the truth  Sometimes  You know?  So what?  A lot of Italian Americans  But not a lot were involved in crime  But a lot of people in organized crime  Were Italian  Still are  So  A lot of Asian people  They drive like crap 
[00:26:30]  So  You've gone too far  What am I talking about?  Why?  Why?  And why do they drive like crap, Anthony?  You can blindfold these people with dental floss  Huh?  Well, dice bit  I don't know why they drive like crap for some reason  I don't know  I'm not offended, though, by The Sopranos  I find it a very entertaining show  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, how you doing?  I just wanted to say that I'm 100% Irish  And I don't find that offensive at all 
[00:27:00]  Everyone these days is way too racially sensitive  If you weren't so drunk  If you weren't so drunk  You would find that offensive, sir  I don't know about that  No, we've all gotten way too serious in this world  Way too serious  It's ridiculous  How about the guy in Washington  That used the term niggardly?  He got in trouble for using the word niggardly  And the definition is  Stingy  Stingy  Yes  Stingy with something  So he said that people were being niggardly 
[00:27:30]  And he got thrown out of his job  Temporarily, albeit  Because they finally got some sense in their head  It was a white guy, too, right?  Yeah  Yeah  He was an aide to, I believe, the mayor?  Yeah  The mayor?  The crack mayor?  Oh, I'm not sure  But he used the term niggardly  And got in trouble for it  Just because it sounded bad  Yeah  Not even because he was using a slur  Because it sounded like the slur  How stupid is that?  When in reality it means stingy  People are just getting out of hand 
[00:28:00]  You can't make references  You can't  It's hysterical  Everyone's part of a group  Yeah, there's big groups that just have their letterhead  They write complaints about us  It's hysterical  We've heard from every single group, I believe  Well, that means we're doing well  We're very diverse in our insults  We don't care  We just, we will talk about any group  Anybody, anything  Hi, any W  That'll be a voice of reason  Hey  Hey, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How are you? 
[00:28:30]  I got a question  Yeah  Is anybody an American anymore?  Uh, not really  You have to be an Italian-American  An African-American  An Asian-American  How come somebody  How come we all have to be from somewhere  You know, my parents were born in Europe  And when somebody asks me  I tell them I'm an American  Of course  I eat hot dogs and hamburgers  I play basketball  And I don't know a damn thing about my  My ancestry  I know my ancestry is Italian  But I don't  I don't base my life around it  Around defending 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, do you have like Italian  Like sculptures and paintings  Do you dress in Italian garb?  Yes  Every day  I dress like Papa Geppetto  From Pinocchio  You know what I'm saying?  That's how I'm dressed  I think if everybody took the attitude  That I'm an American  We'd have less of this crap  Of course  You'd turn on the tube  This group is part of the Korean-American group  Oh boy  Or the Latin-Americans  No, we're all Americans  The people that scream racism the most  Are the people that are the biggest separatists 
[00:29:30]  In the United States  Separatism is the disease  Right  That is plaguing us  Exactly  And that is the truth  Hey, those Koreans  I want them to hook me up with some kimchi, man  I haven't had any since I was over there  Do you like that kimchi?  What's that?  That buried cabbage, right?  It smells bad  But it tastes good  All right, guys  All right, man  Have a good day  Take it easy  Yeah, people just get too serious  I don't know  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello, how are you guys doing?  Good, what's up? 
[00:30:00]  I got a good Irish joke for you  If you want to hear it  I'm an Irish-American  And I love telling them  All right, is this what it's going to come down to?  No, we're going to show  That we can have a sense of humor  No matter what our race is  Yeah, I hope so  By just telling racial jokes  All right, here's the deal  Here's the deal  We've got to hit every single group this afternoon  Okay  You can throw out the first joke  But we want to hear all the jokes  Right  All right  How many Irishmen does it take to screw in a light bulb?  How many?  Four  One to hold the light bulb  And three to keep drinking until the room spins 
[00:30:30]  And we're off  There you go  All right, we're going to keep track of all the groups we piss off today  All right  We've got to catch them all or else we'll be wrong, Opie  Yes, the Irish  All right  Irish are covered  Irish are covered  We're waiting for the next person to call in with a racial joke  That's what we're doing for the rest of the show today  Screw it  That's it  It's to prove a friggin' point, man  This isn't damaging anything, for God's sake  Mike, we've gotten too over-the-top serious in this country 
[00:31:00]  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello  Hi, what's up?  Yeah, I'm offended  Because I'm an alcoholic  And I'm tired of all the Irish people getting the credit  For all the drunken mishaps  You want to take credit for all that  I'm a drunken American  Yeah  For God's sake  I'm a drunken American  And I'm tired of the Irish people  You know, every other frickin' background  I can throw it down, too  All right, man  Thank you  I'll drink more Guinness than anybody  I'll drink anybody under the table  Right on  Right on, man  Thanks  That's funny

Why?  Because they like to see the hooker give the money back  Very nice  My God, the damage we're causing here today, Opie

[00:34:30]  Matthew McConaughey was talking about Japs on the Rosie O'Donnell show  So there's a group up in arms over that  Jesse Ventura was on Letterman  Talking about the Irish being drunk up there in St. Paul, Minnesota  He's getting flack about that  And we're just trying to lighten everyone up  We're trying to show how ridiculous this is  Lighten the F up  What is it going to do?  Everyone is so serious these days  They feel that if a joke is told about a certain ethnic background 
[00:35:00]  That if somebody hears it of that ethnic background  They will what?  What will happen?  I don't know what will happen  Get low self-esteem?  Will they drop out of society, Opie?  I don't understand what will happen  By me  So today on the show, we're taking all sorts of jokes  That's it  We're not favoring any one group  And we're equal opportunity offenders here 
[00:35:30]  So far we've offended the Irish, the Italians, the Jews, and the blacks  Okay  We are attempting to make fun of every single group that you could find in New York City  Wow, everything  We've got a long way to go  Yes, we do  You got any on the instant feedback, Anthony?

[00:41:30]  Judas Priest before that  And living after midnight  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony  Boy  And a very good cause is happening  Right now as we speak  Today is the 10th annual  Radiothon to benefit  Tomorrow's Children's Fund  And the CJ  Excuse me  Foundation for SIDS  We urge you to call  877-877-6464  To make a donation right now  We'd greatly appreciate that  Okay?  Is that the telethon that  Imus in the morning was doing?  Yeah, I believe the 
[00:42:00]  I believe the fans started it today  Yeah  I'm so old and senile  I forgot  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Oh, what?  Hey, a lot of old DJs  Checking in on our show today  We had the Greaseman on earlier  What a dee-dee-day  Because the Greaseman got suspended  If you weren't listening earlier  From his Washington radio station  Yes, he did  Because yesterday morning  He was playing Lauryn Hill  And after he played a little snippet  Of her latest record  That won a Grammy last night 
[00:42:30]  He said, no wonder  They dragged them behind trucks  Ouch  So he got suspended without pay  Most likely getting fired  From that gig  See, that's  That's just in poor taste  That's, yeah  You know, I mean  There's no humor to that  Not really  It's different than  A joke  Well, that's  That's being  Shocking  Just to be shocking  Yeah  It's not funny  Yeah  We go down that road  But we at least try to  Get some humor out of it  Yeah 
[00:43:00]  Yeah  Anyway  The bosses want us to stop  Our little  Oh, do they?  Our little point  That we're trying to make  On our show today  See how scared everyone gets?  And you know what?  We're not going to stop  Screw it  Everyone gets all shaken up  They can't take it  Well, the world's simple as this  We said it earlier  It's getting way too politically correct  You can't make any jokes anymore  Without some special interest group  Just losing it  Absolutely losing it  Yeah  So today we decide to just kind of  Completely open up of the airwaves 
[00:43:30]  And allow you guys  To tell jokes  About other groups  I want to see what's bubbling  Under the surface, you know  Because everyone's been shut down  You can't tell jokes anymore  About different ethnic groups  You get yourself in trouble  Yeah  So are they gone?  Does no one tell them anymore?  Is that it?  They tell them behind closed doors  I guess  They've vanished off the face of the earth?  And every group is guilty of this?  Of course  And the funny thing is  People are calling the bosses  And complaining about this 
[00:44:00]  Even though we're trying to offend  Every single group  Yeah  That's our goal today  We want a joke about  Every single ethnic group  On the face of the earth  Or that at least lives in New York City  Which is pretty much the earth  Alright  We have taken care of the following groups  So help us out with other nationalities  Okay  We've taken care of the Orientals  Asians, Opie  Asians  See, you're going to get in trouble  We've taken care of the Irish  We've taken care of the Italians  We've taken care of the Jews way too much  We've taken care of the blacks way too much

Alright, um  What do you get when you cross a Mexican and an Italian?  Uh, what?  A guy who makes an offer you can't understand  See, there's an organized crime tie-in to the Italians  And then, uh, illiterate  Oh, my God 
[00:47:00]  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how's it going?  Alright, what's up?  Pretty good  Hey, uh, why can't you trust a woman?  Uh, why?  How can you trust anything that bleeds for five days straight and doesn't die?

Yeah  Need a few of those  Listen, man 
[00:48:00]  Also, if you're calling our radio show  And we have you on hold  We're on like a real long delay  Yeah  So turn down your radio  Don't listen to yourself  Because then we've got to hang up on you  Anthony, we can get the Greeks out of the way  Steven from New York writes  In Greece, how do you separate the men from the boys?  How?  Yeah  With a crowbar  1027 WNEW  The Rock of New York  Collective soul and gel  It's Opie and Anthony  Hey  Well, it's official  The Greaseman did get fired  Fired  Everyone remembers the Greaseman 
[00:48:30]  When he was in New York for a while  But he was down there in Washington  Gobbledy goo  And he got fired  There'll be no more  Of the Greaseman show  Yaddle daddle  You'll have to be slinging lead somewhere else  Greaseman  I'll get another job  With slinging lead  All right, well, let me read this  Maybe I'll be a mercenary  A mercenary, huh?  Mercenary  Yaddle diddle doodle  Gobbledy goo  You went over the top today, though, Greaseman 
[00:49:00]  Over the top  I'm a shock jock  Yaddle diddle  All right, here's the AP story  It's going to be a huge story tomorrow  A shock jock who made light of a grizzly  Shock jock  Of a grizzly racial killing  Lost his job Thursday  A relatively rare case of radio shock  Deemed simply too shocking  The Greaseman was fired by station WARW  Wow, his career was going well, huh?  WARW Wednesday  After he played a portion of a song 
[00:49:30]  By Grammy Award winning singer Lauryn Hill  And remarked  No wonder people dragged them behind trucks  I meant to see these  Yaddle diddle doodle  The comment linked Hill, of course  Who was black to the dragging death in Texas  Of a black man, James Byrd Jr.  A white supremacist  Was sentenced to death Thursday  In Byrd's killing  A statement from the station  Announcing the Greaseman's firing Thursday  Apologized to listeners who were offended  You want me to read the statement really fast or no?  Yeah, I guess so 
[00:50:00]  This whole thing is pretty interesting  While we will always strongly support  The right of our on-air artists  To express a wide range of opinions  Even those that are unpopular or offensive to some  WARW cannot be associated with the trivialization  Of an unspeakable act of violence  The statement read  The Greaseman deserved to be fired  For a remark that was  Stupendously stupid  Stupendously stupid  And double stupendously evil  Evil  Gobbledy goo 
[00:50:30]  Now this AP story goes on to say  But if history is a guide  The Greaseman may be back in the air  Somewhere before too long  Who is Harrison?  Although Harrison estimates a shock jock  Gets the boot about once a year  Somewhere in the country  The genre and its practitioners endure  Previously the best known recent example  Of a shock jock firing  Was Bob Grant's dismissal  From WABC right here in New York  In 1996  After saying he was a pessimist  For believing that 
[00:51:00]  Commerce Secretary Ron Brown  Had survived a plane crash  Oh my god  Brown who was black  Died in the crash that year  Grant who in the past  Had referred to blacks as savages  Is back on the air  At a rival New York station  I just meant the rioting blacks  Savages  Bob Grant  You buffoons  Other radio hosts regularly  Get in hot water with listeners  Including the widely syndicated  Howard Stern

[00:52:00]  But will also attract listeners  That matter to advertisers  Notably young men  This type of broadcast  Depends on being  Shocking and disgusting  Shocking and disgusting  Goodly gooby  And occasionally  Will hit a nerve  At the wrong time  And somebody will get  Suspended or fired  And then things will go back  Like they were  Alright  And then it goes on  Really fast here  The Greaseman  Also was suspended  Back in 1986  While at another station  The Greaseman said  Talking about the  Martin Luther King holiday

[00:54:00]  It's your idea  What do you mean  It was my idea  I hope he came up  With a great idea  To say the mayor  Of Boston  Was dead  On April 1st  April Fool's Day  And we said he was dead  And then he wasn't  Yeah  We survived the week  Before we got fired though  Yeah  Meetings and everything  And then they dragged us in  And terminated our contract  As they eloquently put it  Yep  Yeah that was  That was our little  Dopey move  Yeah that was really smart of us  Huh Anthony  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah that was real  Intellectual  Well we ended up here 
[00:54:30]  Well we were trying to make fun  Of how all the radio stations  Every April Fool's  Just do some stupid  April Fool's prank  You know  Like hey look out your window  There's a meteorite  Passing over the city  Everyone  You know  Yeah  So we decided  Alright we'll come up  With a prank  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  We'll come up with a prank  Just take it to the total extreme  Which we did  And uh  Boy the mayor was pissed  Well everyone who knew  Our show at the time  Knew it was a joke  Yeah  That's the sad part  It was so obvious  That we were joking 
[00:55:00]  But somehow  They took it seriously  To the point where  What the mayor was  In mid flight  Yeah  So it says  The mayor was flying  From Florida to Boston  When we said it  And uh  No one could get in touch  With him to confirm  Whether he was alive or dead  So his family supposedly  Heard Opie and Anthony  With breaking news  His family doesn't listen  Wasn't listening to our show  Yeah  And we're breaking news  We're breaking  On our show  Yeah  We were the wins of Boston  Oh yeah  Oh of course  Everyone who listened  To our show  Knew we were just 
[00:55:30]  A bunch of a-holes  But um  But somehow  They took it as fact  And then  Being a politician  He had to squeeze  A bunch of sympathy  Out of it  Yeah  So uh  He did  And well  He had to have  A press conference  To tell everyone  That he was alive  And then uh  All the TV news stations  Had to have the scroll  You know how  They do the winner  Advisory  Yeah  But it was saying  Uh  The mayor's alive  And well  What you heard  Is just an April  Full strike  Ouch  And then Anthony 
[00:56:00]  And I  For uh  What about two weeks  Turned out to be  The Joey Buttafuoco  Of Boston  Yeah  We couldn't go anywhere  Without like TV crews  Hunting us down  And camping on our lawns  Who knew it would be  Such a huge story  But that's the way  These things happen  You know  Yeah  You get on the air  You say something  I mean  Grease man saying that  I mean that's just stupid  You know  It's not even like  I don't know  It's not even entertaining  In a way  Yeah there's no real  I don't know  Just doing it for shock value  Right  Our whole point was  We didn't do it for a shock value  Just did it 
[00:56:30]  We just wanted to show  We just wanted to show  How stupid  All the other radio stations are  When they come up  With their wacky  April Fool's pranks  Exactly  You know  Like hey  The Stones are playing  A surprise date  In the city tonight  And you have a thousand people  Show up at a club  And you know  But whatever  But when this happened  Yeah people were saying  Well Opie and Anthony  That's it  They're gone  That's it for their career  You know  They blow it by saying  The mayor was dead  And all our enemies  And all the people  That hated us  At all the other radio stations  They laughed  They had such a big laugh  Over us getting fired

[01:04:00]  If he used his  Schween in the commission  Of a crime  Yeah  So that's what the whole  Car thing is  They could take it away  So it might  It might have to go that route  Well  Maybe Giuliani's gonna do that  Why don't we go one further  All rapists have to have  Their schlongs cut off  Confiscate the schlongs  Confiscate the schlongs  Don't put it past Rudy  It's coming  If you're hitching  Take the thumb  Take the thumb  Things like that  Jaywalking  Take the feet  Yep  I like it  Could I say  Take the feet

[01:06:00]  Being imitators  And things like that  It wouldn't be an issue  Can anyone take a joke anymore  1027 WNEW  The Rock of New York  Def Leppard  Armageddon it  And Zeppelin too  It's Opie and Anthony  Hey  I don't know if we're getting  More complaint jokes  Or ethnic jokes  At this point  People are really losing it  It's so weird  Yeah  I don't  I don't get it  I don't know  I don't know  We're allowing people  To tell ethnic jokes  On our show today  Just so people  Will just lighten up  And the people 
[01:06:30]  That have called in  To complain  We like asking them  The question  What do these jokes do  Alright let's look  At the pros and the cons  What's the upside  To these jokes  You might be driving  Guilty as you may be  You get a chuckle  You're giggling  And you're hoping  No one saw you laugh  Yeah you've heard  These jokes before  Of course you could be  Outraged by its content  But if you're alone  You laugh at them  Now let's look  At the bad side  What's the downside  To some of these jokes  Hmm  I don't know 
[01:07:00]  I don't know  They insult somebody  So I'm insulted  A lot of times  Every day  It's part of life  It is part of life  But I don't see  I don't think  They're going to kill anyone  I don't think  They'll psychologically  Scar anybody  Any worse than  Just living life  Psychologically scars you  And we really don't  Have an agenda here  It's not like  We've picked on one group  We've picked on as many groups  That live in New York City  As possible  No  As possible  That's it  This is what we are 
[01:07:30]  We are human beings  And we were talking  To one lady  She's like  You know  She says  You know  That she loves us  You know  Things were really cool  And stuff  But she said  We went way too far today  Yeah  And then we said  Well what  You know  What do you find funny  She goes  Well all those  Stephen Lynch songs  I'm like  The Stephen Lynch songs  Are in the same vein  As what we're doing today  She enjoys the gerbil song  Which many gay groups  Have complained about  Saying that it harms  The gay community  Yeah the priest song  I go  You heard the priest song  On our show  Which has been banned 
[01:08:00]  You know  You know how many  Complaint letters  And special interest groups  Have jumped on that one  Because we played it  There's so many  Special interest groups now  That you can't  That's what we're  Trying to show you  You can't do anything  You can't talk about anything  Kill a kitten  Animal rights activists  Want our heads  Yes  But she finds that  Okay  But telling an ethnic joke  Not okay  I don't see the difference  I don't see what they do  I don't think they're as harmful  As everybody thinks they are 
[01:08:30]  They think only  Only psychopaths  Are telling these things  And they're  Like one joke away  From going out  And murdering  Based on jokes  I don't think that's the truth  I think most of the people  Tell these jokes  All the time  To their friends  Co-workers  And that's just the way it is  Yeah  You know  And our show is based  Loosely on reality  A little too much reality  In here sometimes  Well you know  Yeah  Yeah let's go on the radio  And make believe  That no one tells  An ethnic joke  At work 
[01:09:00]  Or they're out  With their pals  Yeah black guys  Don't tell any ethnic jokes  Yeah  No  Italians don't  Tell any ethnic jokes  Everyone's telling them  They always have  Always will  No one's going to stop  No group with their  Fancy letterhead  And complaints  Are going to stop  Basic human nature  That's why people watch  The sensationalist shows  On Fox every Thursday  Oh they're on tonight  That's why  They're high rated  No matter how many people  Write in and call  And complain about them  And try to get them stopped 
[01:09:30]  The majority of the people  Are watching it  Yes  And you're not going to  Change that by thinking  That we're so high  Above all this  On the evolutionary scale  What about  You know  We're not  We laugh  At other people's  Differences  Other people's  Misfortunes  It's just the way  We are  Period  As humans  That's it  What about the flack  That the WWF  Is getting lately  Yeah  Yeah now they're  Starting to get flack  Same thing  I mean  The shows are  The hottest shows  On TV right now  But that's  You know  Not good enough 
[01:10:00]  All the special interest  Groups getting involved  Saying you can't  Do that on TV  You can't  You can't have  You can't have a guy  That is a pimp  With hoes  Coming into the ring  To wrestle  But people watch this  You know  If you're upset by it  Maybe in  10, 20,000 years  When we're all  Wearing the tinfoil  Silver suits  And we're all  Walking around  This luscious planet  Loving each other  These things will be  A thing of the past  But it's just not  The way it is right now  We still enjoy 
[01:10:30]  These things  And I think  They should be  Accepted  With that said  On with the jokes  Scott from Seaford  Writes  How can you tell  If a Polack's  Been using a dildo  How  Her teeth are chipped  Now see  I'm Polish  Partly  Damn why did I have  To admit that  On the radio  Are you partly Polish  Yeah  It's obvious  I'm partly Polish  It is obvious  It's very obvious  I know  Carl from the Bronx  Got a joke for you guys  Now  I'm assuming Carl's
