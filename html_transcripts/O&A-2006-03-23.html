<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of the hosts' career trajectory, including their past firings (following a prank announcing the death of Boston's mayor) and their subsequent success on XM Satellite Radio.  This led to a protracted feud with Howard Stern, fueled by a caller's question and further inflamed by a news story alleging Stern wore a wig and speculation about a hair replacement company he supposedly used.  The hosts also detailed a recent *South Park* episode satirizing Scientology and the controversial departure of Isaac Hayes, graphically describing Chef's violent death.  Their critique of *American Idol*, focusing on Paula Abdul's suspected intoxication and Simon Cowell's judging style, concluded this segment. The segment was punctuated by frequent profanity, a heated exchange with a confrontational caller, and comedic banter between the hosts.  No guests were present in the studio during this initial segment.

The following segment featured Seth Green as an in-studio guest.  The discussion centered on *American Idol*, with Green joining the hosts in analyzing various contestants' performances, including Chris Daughtry's "Walk the Line" cover, and comparing it to Johnny Cash's original and Joaquin Phoenix's rendition in the biopic.  Other contestants like Mandisa, Paris, Catherine McPhee, Taylor Hicks, and Bucky Covington were also discussed.  The second major topic involved a bitter dispute with comedian Dice, with Opie expressing hurt and betrayal over Dice's harsh criticisms on Howard Stern's show, recalling a past friendship and Dice's previous gratitude for their support.  Green also discussed his various television projects (*Robot Chicken*, *Family Guy*, and the canceled *Four Kings*), the creative process behind *Robot Chicken*, and a positive experience working with Ryan Seacrest.

The next segment involved a heated discussion about radio DJ Dave Lenihan's firing for using the racial slur "coon" on air.  Opie and Anthony debated the fairness of his dismissal, arguing it was a slip of the tongue, and contrasted it with other instances of perceived worse racial commentary that went unpunished. This was followed by a humorous extended bit about a reported leprechaun sighting in Mobile, Alabama, featuring listener calls and increasingly absurd audio clips.  Jimmy Norton was in studio during this segment.  The hosts also reflected on past conflicts and relationships, and several show-associated websites were mentioned. Audio clips of Lenihan's incident and apologies were played.

A later segment explored corporate radio's responses to on-air controversies, contrasting damage control with a ratings-driven approach.  They referenced specific incidents, including the firing of Cowhead for an off-air comment.  The hosts also discussed the return of the Liquid Metal channel on XM radio, crediting listener demand and their advocacy, with Eric (presumably a program director) and Ziggy from MyRadioStore.com calling in.  This was followed by an interview with Joe Gannascoli ("Vito" from *The Sopranos*) about his career, *Celebrity Fit Club*, and his book, *A Meal to Die For*, and a brief conversation with rock journalist Alan Light about Black Sabbath and the Beastie Boys.  The segment was marked by frequent vulgar language.

The final segment featured an author promoting his oral history of the Beastie Boys, detailing his interviews with Bono, Ice-T, Curtis Mayfield, and Johnny Cash. He also critiqued *Walk the Line*.  The latter half devolved into a bizarre contest for an NCAA basketball trip, with listeners Chris (offering to pluck hairs from his scrotum) and Rob from Jackson, New Jersey (proposing various acts involving "Stalker Patty," including toe-sucking and biting) escalating the vulgarity to a new level,  with descriptions and close-up camera views for a Paltalk audience. The winners were eventually announced.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Thank you 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[00:03:30]  The creation against the church is disrespectful.  It's a true sacrilege.  It was just a joke.  Opie's fault again.  How can we blow up our lives today?  A few rocking sex.  A few rocking sex.  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Oh, we're in it again.  They hire people who are artists to do a certain thing, and then when they go too far, they  suddenly wash the hands of them if they feel the heat is too heavy.  Opie and Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Opie and Anthony should not have been fired.  Technically, we didn't get fired. 
[00:04:00]  They probably shouldn't have hired them in the first place.  Exiled radio hosts.  They had been fired in Boston after announcing that the mayor was killed.  Another prank.  And I go, Anthony, I got a great idea today.  We're going to tell the whole city of Boston that the mayor died in a fiery car crash while  he was on vacation in Florida.  What do you think?  Oh, my God.  Is this a bad one?  Oh, it just gets worse and worse.  Everything just went right down the crapper.  Can I just say fuck?  Yes!  The duo has signed on with XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:04:30]  Thank God.  Yeah, we'll make it work.  Oh, what a glorious day.  It's all about me.  I play golf with old guys.  Anthony.  I am a grinning idiot.  Act, act, act.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're back now.  The new cloud of the radio.  Ho, ho, Opie.  Shut up!  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  My name is Opie and Anthony.  Opie's who?  Big, beautiful. 
[00:05:00]  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  I love Opie and Anthony.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You beast.  You savage.  Come on, bark like a dog for me.  Bark like a dog.  I will take you any more warning discretion. 
[00:05:30]  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Don't shoot the ass!  Don't shoot!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nothing else. 
[00:06:00]  I got nothing else.  I got nothing else.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  You can act like a man!  What can I ask you?  I love that.  Oh God, we're so distracted.  Hi!  What time is it?  Is it vacation time yet?  This is our last show before vacation.  There were rumors all over the fan sites.  Are they doing a show Friday? 
[00:06:30]  Are they doing a show Friday?  No, we will not be doing a show tomorrow.  No.  We're going to see how it's like to live like Howie and take a Friday off.  I think we're shortchanging the listeners.  Yeah, come on.  I got to get out of here.  I've got to get to Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico.  I got to get on a plane. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you.  So, yeah, I got places to go.  And I bought a video iPod.  I got Steve working on getting me some stuff so I can watch it on the plane.  I'm like, Steve, don't worry about the show today.  Just fill up my video iPod with whatever you can find.  Thank you.  Uh-oh.  No, it's all legal.  Look for an arrested Opie at the airport when they find child porn on his iPod.  Yeah, I'm going to see how much Steve likes me. 
[00:07:30]  Hey, and I said, can you imagine going through the bag?  Well, I see you have a video iPod.  Yeah.  Could you turn that on, sir, so we know it's not an explosive device?  That's my latest purchase.  There's this little Southeast Asian boy on here.  What is he going to do?  Oops.  And then all I say is, he didn't.  But it's Steve C.  He didn't.  I swear, it's whoo, whoo.  It's like that old Sam Kinison bit about his chick getting back at him.  And she packs his luggage for his trip. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  And just kind of sneaks a gun in there.  He has no idea.  Yeah.  Just kind of sneaks a gun in there.  That is a great bit.  That is a great bit.  Watch your luggage.  I can't wait.  I haven't even eaten yet.  Yeah, you were busy.  I saw you ordering something online.  It was so cute to watch.  I was watching Opie use the computer.  How sad is this?  It asked for my credit card.  Yeah.  And the mailing address for my credit card.  Oh, no.  And I went, uh. 
[00:08:30]  You don't know what the mailing address is.  And I was just punching in addresses.  And it kept coming back, no.  Just old addresses?  All sorts of addresses.  You don't know what address you have on file with your credit cards.  Nah, I have no idea.  Nah, I don't.  I have no idea.  That's a sure sign that you order a lot of things online when you know everything.  You know your stupid little three or four digit little code number now that's on the credit cards by heart.  You know your whole credit card number.  I can't remember anyone's phone number. 
[00:09:00]  I have to go to my speed dial on my cell phone to call anybody these days.  Even my house.  Everybody.  Yet I can just type in my credit card number, which is umpteen thousand numbers.  I know the expiration date.  I know that four digit code.  Because I'm online buying shit all the time.  I actually still go to stores.  Something you don't do anymore.  Stores are a thing of the past, sir.  Gotta say hi to everyone at the iPod store at the Walt Whitman Mall.  Huge fans.  Huge fans. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Pictures galore.  I just wanted my stupid video iPod.  Where's the mall?  Walt Whitman Mall?  Yeah.  On 110.  On 119.  Yeah.  In Huntington.  Hey, this guy wants to say we suck.  Chris in Boston.  All right.  The floor is yours, Chris.  Chris.  Hey, how you doing?  You're on the air, sir.  What's going on?  I was hanging out.  Say what you have to say, Chris.  We have a radio show to do.  Well, just curious on why you guys obsess on Stern so much.  All right.  I'll give you a little answer to that.  It's not really obsessing.  Chris, we shut the fuck up and let him answer your question. 
[00:10:00]  Now, let's speak civilly.  I want to address the guy's question.  He said, why do we obsess on Stern so much?  It's not an obsession as much as it is kind of commenting back when we finally can.  We went years where Howard didn't allow us to talk about him because he was scared of what we would say and went to Mel Karmazin and kept us from talking.  And now that we have the opportunity to, unfettered, we decide when and what we want to say about him. 
[00:10:30]  It's not every day.  It's not obsessing.  It's just facts that come up.  He's a guy, a very popular radio guy in the news, so when things pop up, we talk about it.  You don't think it's obsessing at all?  No.  Why would it be obsessing?  He's in the same business we're in, albeit he's been very successful for many years.  But he's a public figure.  We talk about him when he pops up in the news.  And we talk about what a scumbag he was to us for the years we worked for the same company.  I think I'm more pissed off at Anthony than Chris because I would have just told Chris because we feel like it. 
[00:11:00]  He's such a tough guy at all behind him.  Because we feel...  Shut up, Chris.  Are you a fan?  Are you a big Howard fan, Chris?  Well, I listen to both you guys, but I think that, you know...  I can hear it in your voice.  You don't listen to both of us, Chris.  Yeah, fuck you, I don't.  Fuck you.  Ooh, scary.  Wow, you're really scary, Chris.  It's the language.  You listen to this too, huh?  Just be honest, dude.  I mean, if you're a Howard fan and you don't like the fact that the show trashes him, then just say that, bro.  Don't be passive-aggressive about it.  It's kind of girlish.  I just think that the whole talent is a total different grade between you guys and them. 
[00:11:30]  I think Anthony's got a lot more talent than Opie, obviously.  Oh, there it is.  That is so obvious.  It's just because I was being nice to you, sir.  Chris, don't play that old game.  People have been trying to play that game for years.  It doesn't work.  Do you get it?  Call Bruce Emit.  Do you get it?  Call Dave Douglas, the pioneer of the divide and conquer.  Yeah, good luck with that.  Call Bob Buckman first, and then call other people from BAB.  I think they're doing pretty good now.  They're listeners.  They're subscribers, I should say.  Who?  We're serious. 
[00:12:00]  Serious?  They're doing okay.  They're on target.  I noticed that your show is so advertised on every XM ad you see.  Yeah, it's not.  Dude, how do you feel about the gag order?  As a Howard fan, how do you feel about that?  Honestly.  I don't agree with it.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, then.  That's all you have to say to it?  I don't agree with it, but I think it's a long time ago where you guys, like I said,  if you guys didn't...  He made it very hard for us to compete, Chris.  He made it very hard for us to make something of ourselves in this business, and we still  were able to do it.  Dude, I got to ask you something. 
[00:12:30]  He is one of the biggest cocks you'll ever meet in your life, but Chris, you'll never  meet him, because he doesn't give a shit about you.  Do you get that yet?  I got to ask you something.  What kind of business are you in?  Myself.  A builder.  You're a builder.  Okay.  Did you ever have to deal with somebody on the job that was just a cock?  Oh, yeah.  And you deal with him, and everyone is like, this guy is such a fucking asshole, and it  makes my day miserable, like almost on a daily basis.  Absolutely.  That was Howard to us, not just like what you heard Howard talk about with other jocks 
[00:13:00]  and how it's like, oh, I invented everything, not even that.  He was a fucking prick to us when we worked for the same company, a lot of behind-the-scenes  shit that I think people can identify with at their own work, at their own workplace.  The guy was a prick.  That's why we talk about him.  If there's a guy, you know, old Bob at the office, that every day he makes your fucking  life a little more miserable, and it's completely unnecessary, that's what fucking Howard did  to us on a daily basis.  Well, not daily, but often enough where it really annoyed the shit out of us and made 
[00:13:30]  our job worse than it had to be.  Well, you know, so that you guys, I listen to you, I enjoy you, but it just aggravates  me the constant...  Chris, we weren't even going to bring up power, but you had to call the show, so you're the  one that brought up power today.  You're obsessing, Chris.  No, no.  Obi did this morning when he said he was taking Fridays off.  Oh, well, that was just a quick little dig.  Who cares?  You still did it, though, didn't you?  That was fun.  We enjoyed doing that.  Chris is right.  We're obsessing. 
[00:14:00]  Chris, you've got to understand, man, when you're in a competition, I mean, it's like,  why was that acceptable for Howard to do to DiBella or for other people?  I mean, it was fair to do.  It was a competition, and it was vicious.  I mean, so why was that okay?  But now, Howard fans will call up and go, gee, why are you guys obsessed?  Instead of realizing, look, man, this is the way it goes.  He did this to people, and now people do it to him.  And, Chris, it's far from an obsession.  We don't spend that much time on it.  And one more thing, Chris.  Yes.  You're on our show discussing this, open and freely. 
[00:14:30]  You could talk about it.  We'll have a discussion about it.  Try calling Howard up and getting into some discussion about this program.  Well, you can't because his lines are always busy.  Well, no, that's not it.  You know something?  Regardless, you would be dumped out of, and you would not get on the air.  He hung up.  Of course he hung up.  Of course he did.  What did you want to just yell?  Baba Bowie?  Stupid?  I don't know.  The guy.  There you go.  I'll have a good vacation.  There he is.  There's one of his boys.  Let's go to Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred?  Well, please allow me to bring up Howard, boys. 
[00:15:00]  Fred.  Lloyd Grove article today in the Daily News.  Tell him, Fred.  I got a big giggle out of that guy.  You guys got great comments there.  Great comments.  You know what?  We did give him some great quotes, but I got to tell you, I think the people are very scared  in the gossip columns of the newspapers.  I think Howard has been controlling those people for many, many years.  Yeah.  Because we gave good old Lloyd, or whatever his name is, gold.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:15:30]  He talked to Anthony and I for like 10, 15 minutes, and we had him laughing really hard  on the phone.  And all he writes in his article about Stern wearing a wig.  This has been reported for many years, by the way.  Does luxuriantly locked Sirius Satellite Radio Jock Howard Stern wear a wig?  Rival Michael Savage of WOR raises the issue in his upcoming book, The Political Zoo, out  April 18th.  It is alleged that his mane is a wig, that beneath it all, without the hairpiece, Stern  looks like a dentist from the Bronx circa 1945, who sells condoms on the side, claims Savage. 
[00:16:00]  XM's radio's, XM radio's Opie and Anthony.  Now, remember, we talked to him for 15 minutes and had him laughing really hard.  He goes, oh, my God, that's great, as he's typing.  So we know we're giving him good stuff.  Oh, my God, you're kidding.  Laughing, typing guy.  Laughing, typing guy.  Here, you give him one, and then I'll be typing guy.  Oh, what, give him a quip.  A quip?  Well, maybe we shouldn't.  A quote?  But we were just going back and forth. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, that's terrific.  Oh, my God, I can't wait.  I'm going to put this part in boldface.  Oh, my God.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  So after all that, and we're feeling pretty good about ourselves because it is war, he  writes, XM radio's Opie and Anthony, meanwhile, told me they have long suspected that Stern  has hair plugs.  No comment from the Stern camp.  That's it.  That's all he got to say.  Wow.  That was it?  Which proves to me that he was way too scared to print what we gave him.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  He was petrified.  And I think Howard controls these guys.  I really do.  I really do.  Wasn't Howard all over Lloyd drove for something a couple of years ago that he was panning  them, that he was not printing something properly?  He should be open and print what you guys say rather than...  This is what we told him.  And we got to be very careful about this.  When we were working for the same company, you know, Anthony and I would meet with clients  all the time.  Yes.  Sometimes, a couple hours a day, we just had to meet with potential clients that wanted 
[00:17:30]  to advertise.  Hey, the latest Dick Cream wants to advertise, but they want to meet you guys up in the conference  room.  All right.  Hey, this pill that you take and your metabolism goes through the roof, they want to advertise.  Right.  Hey, this guy wants to come in.  So we had this guy that was a hair plug guy.  Or hair replacement.  Hair replacement.  Well, there was a few that we met.  It was actually a lady.  Ah.  It was a lady.  Yeah.  You're talking about the dude from Philly.  Yeah.  Who wanted to, like, take away man boobs.  And he looked at Anthony and I and said, well, we do hair plugs, too, but you guys are doing 
[00:18:00]  just fine, so that sucks.  Yeah, he wanted everybody to get plugs and boobs.  Fat sucked.  The guy was like.  And he made his own wine, remember?  Yeah, he made his own wine.  That's great.  Homemade wine.  I make it out of the fat.  I suck from man tits.  He must have.  Wonderful.  He must have, because his wine sucked.  Didn't even drink it.  I was just getting into wine back then.  And I tried it.  Ugh.  Anyway, so we met with another hair replacement company. 
[00:18:30]  Mm-hmm.  And this was told to us.  Mm-hmm.  This was definitely told to us.  They were coming aboard, thinking about coming aboard.  And they said that Howard actually was a client.  Yeah.  They told us that.  Wow.  Can I prove that?  No.  And I'm going on the radio right now.  I cannot prove that.  Prove it.  But this was told to us behind closed doors at a huge conference table.  Mm-hmm.  Huge. 
[00:19:00]  And this company was so bummed out, because they're like, he looks so freaking good with  what we did for him.  But he will not admit this ever.  But if he did, the endorsement we would get would be just unbelievable.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Everybody would be running to my office to get their problem taken care of.  That was told to us.  Now, I don't know if this person had a beef with Howard and decided to, like, stir the  pot.  Mm-hmm.  I have no idea.  But obviously the paper didn't want to print that.  No.  So we told that story to Lloyd or whatever his name is, and he was like, oh, my God. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, this is cold.  Yeah.  Just typing away as fast as possible.  So that's what did not make the paper today.  Instead, he writes, XM Radio's Opie and Anthony, meanwhile, told me they have long suspected  that Stern has hair plugged.  Great.  I knew you had a better quote when I read that.  I knew it.  Absolutely.  Dude, have a great, well-deserved vacation, fellas.  Enjoy.  You know, we gave him a whole page, and the whole article on it was less than a paragraph. 
[00:20:00]  Incredible.  All right, Fred.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate, what's up?  Morning, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, I know.  I mean, look, Howard has a wig.  You guys have those people on the payroll, don't you?  They might like a story like that.  They just might.  Take it easy, guys.  Have a good vacation.  All right.  Let's go to Dan in Philly.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  I just want to let you know that there is the crossover fan between the two of you guys,  because I really enjoy your show, and I'm also a fan of Howard's. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, that's what happened when we were doing Afternoons.  And we understand the audience.  We understand that.  We certainly understand that.  We just don't want him pushing us around anymore and using his power behind the scenes to make  our jobs miserable.  And Chris, that guy at that first caller, wasn't calling as a real fan of both.  He was just saying that to try, because he figured he was going to get hung up on if he  didn't say it.  Yeah, the guy does not like our radio show.  That was very obvious.  So he was lying right off the bat.  We understand there's people out there that like both shows. 
[00:21:00]  We certainly understand that.  I listened to you guys when you were in Philly on YSP.  I got a new car last year at XM.  I immediately turned to 202, and I've been listening to it since.  When Howard came to Sirius in January, I got it for my wife.  I liked it.  I got it for my car.  Now I have both.  Now I flip back and forth.  I listen to you guys.  You're funny.  If something gets boring, I flip over to Howard and the same thing back.  So I am a fan.  Be honest.  You're flipping back to XM a lot, aren't you?  I am.  I am. 
[00:21:30]  But I'll be honest with you.  I'm flipping to XM to 202, and that's it.  Well, that's what I mean.  Yeah.  All right.  We don't care.  As far as we're concerned, the rest of XM could fucking die, and we would never know  it.  As long as this room was okay.  I found some guy to just give me 202 at this point.  That's all I have on my XM.  Yeah.  I have 202 in traffic.  I have 202 in the 40s.  And I also have the Boneyard.  All right.  Thank you.  No, you can't add channels now.  I want to add channels.  The bit was it's only 202, and then you added one. 
[00:22:00]  I had to.  Traffic was cute, but then you added another cool station.  We have to be the only cool station.  Speaking of stations.  Oh.  My brother's going to kill you.  He's right here.  Why am I?  He's ready to do his bit today.  He's taking his bit.  Don't take his bit.  I'm not.  It's your bit.  You said you made it up.  You said that he stole from you.  Well.  That's what he said.  Woo-hoo.  Between the brothers, Kay.  All right.  Let's move on to other things, then.  Oh, by the way, I just had to throw out a plug real quick, because you mentioned, I'm going  to mention The Godfather in that thing. 
[00:22:30]  Did anybody see Robert Duvall's movie?  He did a movie, because apparently he loves to tango.  Ugh.  Dude.  I know.  Did anybody out there see a movie called Assassination Tango?  Stop it.  Dude, I love Duvall.  In the same way I love a parent, I love Duvall.  And I heard that this was a movie about, because he has such a passion for the tango, that he  wants to make a movie about the tango.  And he plays an assassin in a ponytail who goes to kill someone, and he's walking by a window,  and he sees a gal tangoing.  And he begins to, like, follow her to tango. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, God.  I got the douche chill on the review alone.  Is it a new movie?  No, I think it's been out for a while.  Somebody I know is, is it likes to tango?  Yeah.  And we were chatting about it online one time, and they said, yeah, Robert Duvall has a tango  movie.  And I'm like, it's gotta be.  Does anyone really like to tango?  How can you, how can you ever like to tango?  Ew, there's the box cover.  That's stupid.  Assassination tango.  Very nice.  That's what should happen to you if you do the tango. 
[00:23:30]  All right, let's move on.  Let's go to Jake in Atlanta.  Jake, what's going on today, buddy?  Morning, boys.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Jake.  Hey, did you guys catch South Park last night?  God damn it, I missed it.  Hysterical.  There was so much love the boys had for Isaac Hayes, and it was such a shame that they had  to bring him out back like Old Yeller and put a bullet in his head.  It was one of the funniest South Parks ever, ever.  And when you know the backstory, why they were doing it, it's even funnier. 
[00:24:00]  And very subtle about Scientology on that one.  They called it the Secret Adventure Club.  A Super Adventure Club, yeah, Super Adventure Club.  And all they do is go around the world having sex with young children.  Wow.  Oh, dude, they turned Chef into a pedophile by using old sounds from the past ten years.  They just clipped together sentences that he's saying of how he wants to stick his scrotum, 
[00:24:30]  stick his balls up Kyle's asshole and have sex with young children.  And then at the end, they just kill him off.  And they got away with this on Comedy Central?  In a horrific way, yeah.  Wow.  Of course they did.  Wow.  Well, at the end, he ended up like Darth Chef, so there is kind of a hope that he needs to  come back.  Because they killed him off where first he's set on fire, then he falls off a cliff, hits  a stake at the bottom, and goes right through him. 
[00:25:00]  And somebody, then a lion comes out and starts eating him.  So somebody tries to shoot the lion and accidentally shoots Chef twice.  Then a grizzly bear comes out and rips his legs off, and the lion rips his face right off  his skull.  And he's just laying there with no limbs and no face, bleeding to death.  And then he craps himself.  That's great.  And then the Scientology people go, he would have made a great child molester.  It's a shame. 
[00:25:30]  He would have made a great child molester.  Oh, they messed him up, huh?  Oh, it was great.  Well, we got some audio from South Park's Chef Returns.  And the way they pieced the audio together was so funny, because it's so obvious.  And you know they could have pieced it together where it would have been flawless, but they  did it on purpose.  They, you know, hello, children!  All right, thank you, Jake.  All right, boys, thanks.  Cool, yeah, so we got some audio from South Park's Chef's Return.  Well, they killed him off last night, because of the controversy. 
[00:26:00]  Now they're saying in the paper that Chef, uh, or Isaac Hayes didn't want to quit.  Didn't he say?  Of course he didn't want to.  He was forced to.  But now they're saying that he had a stroke or something.  Stop.  And that, uh, it was some kind of, some other guy from, um, the Scientology thing there  that, uh, sent out the press release.  All released a statement for him?  Where the heck is that?  But we were just talking to him.  Is this a happy RX for depression?  What? 
[00:26:30]  No.  Here it is right here.  Page, uh...  Stop.  22.  No, page 22.  I'm not going to page 22.  32, I'm sorry, 32, 32.  I'm not going to 32.  I don't believe you.  Is it really 32?  Hepburn y'all to sue.  I have no idea.  What the hell is it?  Actually, I think it's in the post.  Eric, why don't you help find something?  Wait, get your fingers broken.  All right, here it is.  Chef needs a job.  Isaac Hayes may not have quit South Park at all, or at least not willingly.  Turns out Hayes has been away from Comedy Central's hit show for the past three months 
[00:27:00]  because he had a stroke.  According to Fox News...  Three months?  When did we have him on?  Time goes by in a weird way when you do this radio show.  Tell us, we think, you know, Isaac was on a week ago.  How long ago?  It was over three months?  Maybe.  Maybe we can find that out.  I don't think so.  E-Rock.  According to Fox News.com, he's at home recuperating and did not issue the press release, which  said he was quitting because the show made fun of his faith.  That release was put out by fellow Scientologist Christina Kumi Kimball, a fashion executive 
[00:27:30]  for designer Craig Taylor.  According to Fox News.com, Hayes loves South Park and needs it for income.  He has a new wife and a baby on the way.  End of December?  End of December he was on our show?  Wow.  Maybe right after I get a stroke.  So, there's still controversy over the whole chef thing, because we do have the clip where  he basically says he had no problem with the Scientology episode.  Wouldn't you think Matt and Trey and the people at South Park would have known if that was  the reason and would have actually maybe spoken to him or looked into it? 
[00:28:00]  You know, you get a character that's been on since the beginning that wants to leave.  I think you wouldn't just take...  That's like, you know, that's like somebody calling you up and saying,  Opie, Anthony, he doesn't want to do the show anymore.  He fell into this religion thing.  And you're going, okay.  Hey, fuck Anthony.  He's gone.  All right.  Let's kill him off.  Let's find sound clips of him.  And me calling and going, hey, Opie.  Well, some lady called and said you quit. 
[00:28:30]  Like, wouldn't you look into it a little more?  Maybe give me a call.  I guess you're right.  I guess.  How great would it be, though, if that's the truth, and then he comes out and just lambast  fucking Scientology with that woman, at least?  That would be good.  I've never seen anybody lambast Scientology, though.  Well, from South Park last night, we got some quick clips of Chef.  It's worth listening to today.  Listen to this.  Well, come on, everybody.  I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.  That's right.  Thank you.  Goodbye, everybody. 
[00:29:00]  Later.  Well, I guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.  You bet.  Goodbye.  Children.  It's like the worst collection of clips.  All right.  Yeah, because they couldn't get Isaac Hayes to do his part for this episode.  Hello there, children.  Hey, Chef.  How's it going?  Good.  Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we can make love? 
[00:29:30]  Excuse me?  Come on, children.  You're my sexual fantasy.  Let's all make sweet love.  Chef?  Are you okay?  I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.  Dude, what are you saying?  I'm going to make love to your asshole, children.  Oh, my God.  How the hell did they get away with that?  That's great. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, God.  I love the fact South Park did it and it makes me hate Comedy Central even more.  Oh, right.  Because only a cartoon can get away with that kind of language.  How do they get away with that?  On Comedy Central.  Pedophile humor on Comedy Central.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  And they should let them get away with that.  That's exactly.  That is fantastic that they let them do that.  Wow.  I love that.  They must have been roaring laughing making this.  When you have somebody you want to turn the screws on and you have the opportunity to do it like that, turn his character into a kid toucher, they go right for the jugular, man. 
[00:30:30]  I love those guys, Matt and Trey.  Yeah.  They don't give a fuck.  I love it.  I love it.  Here's more audio from last night's episode.  Hello there, children.  Chef, the police are asking questions about you.  Oh, really?  Well, let's all go home and make love.  No, Chef, we don't want to make love to you.  Kitty, how would you like to sodomize my black ass?  Chef, Chef, you need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right? 
[00:31:00]  I specialize in your asshole, Kyle.  Oh, my God.  That's unbelievable.  We have a clip here.  The Super Adventure Club describes their mission.  Right.  So this is instead of saying Scientology.  Yeah, instead of Scientology, it was the Super Adventure Club.  And strangely enough, it was an Adventurer's Club.  It was the Adventurer's Club from Disney, which is kind of like what I want to turn my office into.  I saw it last night, and now they ruined the whole idea for me.  Wow, that should have made it better. 
[00:31:30]  It was really good because they actually had some of the stuff that is in the Adventurer's Club at Disney animated in the background.  The statues and various artifacts that are in there.  Yeah.  So apparently they'd been there a few times.  Uh, hi.  Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids.  What?  Well, well, yes, of course.  That's what the Super Adventure Club does.  Huh?  We travel the world and have sex with children. 
[00:32:00]  Yes, what else would we do?  Well, we thought you went exploring and, like, hunting and stuff.  No, no, that's the Adventure Club.  We're the Super Adventure Club.  Next week, we will be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe.  Then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K2 and molest several Tibetan children on the East Summit.  Go!  I know, but it gets even better.  From there, we will climb to the fruitful banks of the Mili River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanini people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. 
[00:32:30]  Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places.  So, how would you all like to join the Super Adventure Club?  Are you kidding me?  Fantastic.  And you can't say fart on regular radio anymore?  Yeah.  Fantastic.  This country stinks.  This is such a great way to screw over Scientology.  And they get away with it, because technically it's a cable channel, right? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  They're always allowed to do it.  Yeah.  It's just that most of them are politically correct cowards, but yeah, they're allowed to.  But this is how...  Well, maybe I shouldn't get into this, because we're taking advantage of the loopholes.  Yeah.  I'm not regulated.  It's just silly to me, because if this same episode was, let's say, on NBC, CBS, or something...  Well, never.  Holy crap.  All hell would break loose.  I'd cry.  But on your same TV, I don't give a shit, but just about all of America has cable now.  You go a little further up the dial to quote a cable channel, and then it's okay? 
[00:33:30]  Technically, you don't have to have cable.  You can buy a TV, and it won't have cable.  I guess that's their argument.  I know, but it's just so ridiculous.  The rules they set.  Yeah.  It's so ridiculous.  I love that they just took a half hour of their programming and turned it into a personal  vendetta against Scientology.  And you know what?  You know, don't get me wrong.  This shit, like Jimmy said, should be on TV.  Absolutely.  But all that hell that broke loose because of Janet Jackson's boob for a quarter of a second or what have you. 
[00:34:00]  So this aired last night, and...  Yeah.  Yeah.  For some reason, South Park really gets away with, because even cable channels take heat for content, you know?  They get complaints and everything, but South Park, for some reason, they've just left alone.  I wouldn't mind it as much if I didn't have a 25-year-old fucking college graduate standards and practices person telling me that you can't make domestic violence jokes.  What happened? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, when I was doing a, uh...  Oh, the famous story on your CD.  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  This is, uh, this is, uh, uh, we had to do a, um, on an Act 4 for Tough Crowd one time, we had to do a, uh...  And people have to understand that with Comedy Central and all these networks, most Act 4s were done into cameras, so that had to be run by practices and standards.  You have to submit that just to make sure you weren't doing product trashing or things that they were tied into.  And one of the ones we did, I forget what it was about, it was about, uh, make your own movie or some shit like that.  So I wrote, it was a 30-second blur about a cop buddy movie between Muhammad and Jesus as two cop buddies, like the lethal weapon. 
[00:35:00]  And one of the lines had something to do with domestic violence and how they get called to a call and Muhammad would arrest their husband for not beating his wife properly, blah, blah.  And then they said, you can't do that because it's domestic violence, you can't talk about domestic violence.  And I'm like, but it's about, it's about anti-domestic violence, about how Islam treats women.  Right.  And they're like, wow, you know, and I had to go through, I had to go over, of course, the 25-year-old pukey college girl standing in practice's head to somebody higher than her who finally approved it. 
[00:35:30]  We really had to fight for that one.  Yeah, it's like, don't you get it?  It's not about domestic violence, it's not about beating, it's about the fact that the Muslim religion, that was the joke.  Of course.  That they're beating their women and the comedy there is the fact that he's being arrested for not beating.  But do you understand how, like, you get caught in a moment like this where I love the fact that Matt and Trey do this, this is exactly what you should do, and then you remember your own experiences and you want to just grab somebody and bite their fucking nose off.  It's like bittersweet, it's like I'm happy for them to do this, but. 
[00:36:00]  Stuff like that doesn't ruin comedy, you know.  It's like, it's like, Jesus, you're a comedy network, do you have to, you should give everyone this kind of content freedom.  Yep.  Not just black performers and cartoons.  You know why?  Comedy goes to some dark places, and these people don't understand that.  They just want happy comedy.  And they think it's just going to be, you know, crude dick joke and stuff.  This was done very creatively and very clever and really funny. 
[00:36:30]  The veiled Scientology explanation and everything is just great.  Like, this is what comedy to me is supposed to be, even though I'm not a South Park fan, when you're striking back, and they did it much better than I would, I would have done it out of anger and just been an asshole and not been as fun.  This is just, what a great slice to the throat this is.  Oh, yeah.  And no one can do anything about it.  You've got to sit there and take it.  They're talking about you and you know it, but there's nothing you can do about it.  It's like, we hate this organization, what's the worst way we can portray them?  As pedophiles.  No kidding. 
[00:37:00]  It's hysterical.  Take it right for the kid toucher.  Here's the history of the Super Adventure Club.  I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.  We don't want to hear it.  You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phineas.  Phineas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers.  But every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beaten to it.  Phineas was depressed until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places,  he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas. 
[00:37:30]  Phineas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru.  And the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountain folk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part.  You see, after having sex with all those children, Phineas realized that molesting all those kids had made him immortal.  Immortal.  He discovered that children have things called Marlocks in their bodies. 
[00:38:00]  And when an adult has sex with a child, the Marlocks implode, feeding the adult's receptor cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos.  Phineas traveled the world, loving many, many children.  And he lived for eternity.  Until he was hit by a train in 1892.  Do you realize how retarded that sounds?  Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins?  Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for 20 years? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.  Wow.  And during that explanation, they put the graphic at the bottom that said, what did it say?  Super Adventure Club actually believed this.  It's the same graphic they put at the bottom when they said Scientologists actually believed this when they explained Scientology in the famous Scientology episode.  Right.  So anyone that was remotely familiar with the situation got the joke. 
[00:39:00]  And finally, we just got two more quick clips.  This is where they kill Chef, I guess.  Yeah, just the most horrible cartoon death scene I've ever seen in my life.  Come on, children.  Let's all go home and make love.  You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef.  It's for your own good.  I'd just like to make love up your butt.  Hello, I'm Dr. Nealon.  What can I do for you today?  Hi, our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.  Doctor, do you have children? 
[00:39:30]  Why, yes, I have two young boys.  Have you all been sodomized with your children, too?  You say he's never been like this before.  No, Chef has always been super cool.  I'm going to make love to the children.  He's pretty brainwashed, all right.  Worst case I've ever seen.  That's great.  That's great.  Yeah, that's when they took him to the shrink.  Oh, okay.  Trying to fix him up.  That's actually another clip that wasn't labeled here.  All right, this is where they kill Chef, I believe. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, my God.  They killed Chef.  You bastards!  You bastards!  Pity.  He would have made an excellent child molester.  Maybe, maybe he's still okay.  No, really.  They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your...  Oh, never mind.  Dismembered body just flung out some crap right out of his ass. 
[00:40:30]  That was great.  And then finally, Darth Chef rises.  Yeah.  Okay.  Chef, can you hear me?  Say something.  Hello there, children.  How would you like some Salisbury steak?  Yes, go on.  And for dessert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls? 
[00:41:00]  Oh, you mean like a chocolate candy?  No, I mean my balls.  Yes.  Yes!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  So are they going to bring him back or something?  I would assume that Darth Chef will be making appearances on the show.  From time to time.  Yeah.  That was a perfect fuck you to Chef, Scientology.  Wow.  And, um...  Bravo to...  Very funny. 
[00:41:30]  Matt and Trey.  I'll bet you that they had something even closer, and I bet you they had to change it.  I'll bet you the lawyers came and said, you can't call the founder that.  It's too close.  Right, it's too close.  Yes, and the Super Adventure Club is nothing near Scientology.  Like, they probably did have...  How close can we get?  Yeah.  All right, it could start with an S.  That's pretty much it where it ends.  Greg and DC, what's up?  Yeah, they actually...  There was a line towards the end when Kyle does his wrap-up where he actually said, don't  blame Chef for what he was doing, blame the group. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So it was a nice way for them to say, we still like Isaac Hayes, he's not a dick, it's the  group that he's a part of that's a bunch of cocksuckers.  That brainwashed him.  Yeah.  Or, I guess, little cocksuckers, but yeah.  Yeah.  All right, thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Isaac Hayes didn't seem like...  I mean, I guess anybody can get caught up in something, but Isaac Hayes didn't seem like  the type of guy.  He's like a fucking man's man, dude.  He doesn't seem like he's...  We're going to play it again.  I mean, we got gold here, and they're starting to play it on TV.  Keith Olbermann played it the other night and gave us credit. 
[00:42:30]  You know, this was Isaac Hayes on our show.  He didn't care about the episode.  It's obvious.  So now, you know, there's more to this story.  I wonder if it'll ever come out.  Hey, my question is for Isaac Hayes.  Yo.  Hey, what did you think...  You're Scientologists, right?  Yeah.  Okay, what did you think about when Matt and Trey did that episode on South Park about Scientology?  Well...  With crews in the closet.  Well...  Yeah, that was a great episode.  They remaned, I think, last week, too.  Yeah, one thing about Matt and Trey, they lampooned everybody. 
[00:43:00]  Mm-hmm.  And if you take that shit serious, then I'll sell you to Brooklyn Bridge for $2.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to realize what they're doing.  Yeah, that's what they do.  See?  Something went on, I'm telling you.  He was a fun interviewer, too, man.  Yeah.  Talking about chicks, and he didn't care how many kids he had.  Yeah.  What, did you get up to, like, 11 or 12?  Oh.  Yeah, I think we were...  Yeah.  He started admitting all the kids he had.  I don't remember the number anymore, but it was way up there.  The guy was carefree. 
[00:43:30]  He cared less about anything.  He just enjoys life and banging, obviously.  Yeah.  He loved doing South Park.  Absolutely loved it.  Reno, Mississippi, what's up?  Ah, nothing much.  How are you guys doing, and hello, chatty-chatty.  Hi, fella.  Want a tango?  Yeah.  Anyway, no, I work in Memphis, and it was about two weeks after your show, they came on,  and, of course, the local news did the whole thing where Isaac Hayes had a stroke, and the 
[00:44:00]  only thing I think is, with a huge contract like that at the Comedy Central, don't you  think he knew just a little bit about that?  Either, I mean, not just hearsay, somebody talking for him?  Well, you don't know how sick he is.  I mean, when Luther Vandross had his stroke, he wasn't speaking at all for himself.  You know what I mean?  He had people talking for...  I don't know how...  I hope Isaac Hayes isn't that bad, but you might be a little bit out of it, dude.  You might be a little disconnected.  No, from what I've... 
[00:44:30]  I mean, I've seen a little bit of local news.  I mean, he's doing all right, you know, okay.  They said that he's...  It was like a mild stroke or whatever.  Let me just explain to you what happened, though.  I just, like an ass, speculated on a situation that I have no knowledge of.  I said...  You have a mic in front of you.  You got the mic in front of you.  You're an expert.  When you have a microphone in front of you, you needn't have facts.  But I didn't even know Isaac Hayes had a stroke until nine minutes ago, and now all of  a sudden I'm going, well, maybe this...  Maybe it's medication.  Maybe the dose...  You're diagnosing his... 
[00:45:00]  I am an idiot.  No, you're not.  You got a mic in front of you.  I know.  The biggest challenge was getting a mic in front of you.  Now that you do, you're an expert on everything.  Expert.  It's just how it works.  Good point.  Oh, good point.  These people are believing this shit out there.  All right.  Right.  Listen, you guys, you guys are awesome.  I mean, I listened to you on the replay and everything, and I got a toast, Jimmy, this  right here that stinks in my head.  What?  So, the butterscotch pudding thing I heard on the replay...  Yes.  ...was just awful.  It stuck in my head, and I told everybody at work, looking at the business, seeing everything. 
[00:45:30]  Good boy.  Wrong.  And I probably got a little on my nose right now.  It's a true story, sir.  All right, Reno.  I only share what the truth is.  Thank you, sir.  Godspeed.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Moving on.  I didn't see South Park last night, because I had to check out American Idol.  DVR.  I know.  I got it on DVR.  I got to go watch South Park when I get home today.  I love it, because I wait until Wednesday night, and then like an hour or so before American 
[00:46:00]  Idol, I watch the previous night from DVR without commercials.  Wah, wah, wah.  You know how fast it goes when all you watch are the performances and the judges at the  end, what they have to say.  Boom, boom, boom.  That's all I watch.  It's too good to be true.  I've said it many times in this program.  This DVR is too good to be true.  And then no waiting, because when you're done with that, you're recording the other one,  and then that's done, and then you zip right to the point where they throw someone off. 
[00:46:30]  Hey, I'm done in probably 40 minutes, which amounts to two and a half hours of programming.  And there's a pattern here, too, because a lot of people are yelling on the screen at  the radio right now, TiVo, TiVo, it's been around for a while.  TiVo was too much of a pain in the ass for me to set up, ever.  Yeah.  This DVR has made it so easy.  It's right on your cable box.  Push record.  I'm there.  It's so easy.  It's part of your cable.  You don't have to plug your phone line in.  Anyone else see the pattern here?  As soon as things get too easy, then the big guy starts paying attention and going, 
[00:47:00]  all right, how do we squash this?  Kind of like the downloading of illegal music.  It's been going on forever.  Got easy.  But when it got easy, that's when they had a problem, because then more people do it.  Not just the geeks.  And then more people do it.  They take away some profit, and then they have to pay attention and do something about it.  That's what scares me about the DVR.  People are jumping aboard every day.  They're realizing an hour show you could watch in like 40 minutes tops, probably even less. 
[00:47:30]  Hour show?  American Idol?  For every hour, you're getting about a half-hour program.  Maybe a little.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's too good to be true.  I'm telling you.  Something is going to happen.  You think eventually advertising is going to crack down, and they're going to redesign them  where you cannot fast forward through the commercials?  Well, you know what?  I think this new technology challenges people, and it's challenging the record companies,  and they've done some cool things because of the downloading of the music and stuff.  And now I think these advertisers out there, let's be honest, most commercials suck, and  we just are stuck watching them. 
[00:48:00]  So maybe this whole DVR phenomenon is going to force them to rethink the whole thing, and  maybe it'll get creative again, where you want to sit through the commercials, or maybe  they'll go with the product placement or whatever.  Or the contest.  Which doesn't bother anyone.  I could give a shit when Paula Abdul is babbling, and you're sitting there wondering what  drug she's on tonight, and she has a Coca-Cola cup in front of her.  Who cares?  I'm all for the product placement, as long as it doesn't take away from the actual entertainment 
[00:48:30]  of the show.  Dude, Tuesday night's show?  Have them wear logos.  I don't give a shit.  She was so fucked up, in my personal opinion, having seen people that have been on narcotics  of some sort, looking at her.  She did look like one of those people.  Can I just say?  Her eyes are like half shut.  She's talking about people.  You are just a treasure.  Hammered.  Well, there's something you don't see every day.  What's that? 
[00:49:00]  What, Eric working?  Awful man.  Thanks.  Hey, Eric, when you're done, can you get one of the fetchers?  I need something.  Oh.  What the hell is that?  Anyway.  You don't want to get yanked off the air.  For what?  Why would it be yanked off the air?  Oh, you can't say anything like that these days.  You get fired in certain months.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, very good.  We'll get into that story in a little while.  Yes, Jimmy.  So anyway, the American Idol thing there, yes. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Watch it on DVR, and it goes by nice and fast.  Nice and quickly.  None of that filler crap that makes up hours.  So we'll only spend a few minutes on this, but two very interesting things.  They finally kicked off Chicken Little.  Little Kevin from Levittown.  And Paula Ado looked like she was going to just cry her eyes out.  Yes.  And I told Anthony, I'm so frustrated with American Idol, their production value stinks.  They need to produce that show better.  They're kicking someone off.  Because now that it's down to 11, 10 contestants, you know, you've got to know these people. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You've invested time in these people.  So it's going to get more and more emotional now that these people get kicked off, right?  And as soon as they were kicking off Chicken Little, who was a very, very popular contestant  in American Idol, you knew the reactions would be great.  Yeah.  You saw, like, kind of a back shot of, like, Paris sort of getting emotional, and that  was pretty much it.  I would have had close-ups going on like crazy.  Yeah.  Because they showed Paula Abdul, like, welling up as the, it was down to, what, Bucky and 
[00:50:30]  Kevin?  Yeah.  And then they never went back to her.  You've got to think she was crying her eyes out.  You want to see the people weeping.  And the producers of American Idol, they didn't give you those shots for some reason.  No.  Because someone's not thinking over there.  No.  Show the crying people.  Yeah.  Show the remaining contestants.  Like, you know, sad for one of their fellow contestants being booted off that they all  obviously liked, you know?  But they missed out on a great opportunity last night, in my opinion.  Yeah.  As far as that goes. 
[00:51:00]  It was pretty much time for Kevin to go.  Definitely.  When he did his little love song there, just wasn't pulling it off.  Sorry.  When I fall in love.  It will be forever.  He's right.  You'll fall.  Or I'll never fall in love. 
[00:51:30]  He's got a good voice.  He should be on Broadway or something, you know?  In a restless world.  Wristless world.  Like this is.  Love has ended before it's begun.  Yeah, he could be unlike Annie.  Exactly.  And to make the moonlight kisses seem to cool in the warmth of the sun. 
[00:52:00]  When I give my heart.  He definitely has a good voice.  He just belongs in like a show, like a play, Broadway.  Well, that's what he said.  I heard a little snippet on the news coming in.  He said he's going back to his school there in Levittown and going back to doing the school  plays, which I guess he's done a few of.  He's probably the one, you know, the drama department probably loves him.  The darling.  What a bummer, though. 
[00:52:30]  He has to go back to high school.  I mean, he's going to be a rock star in the high school.  Oh, forget it.  You know, he'll come out on stage and the plays will go wild.  He's going to be a rock star, but that's a big step down.  You know, they're doing national commercials now and all that.  Yeah.  And there he is on stage.  You think they're going to have a day, you know, for him?  Doing Oklahoma.  Wait, did he miss out on the national commercials?  No.  Well, now it looks like.  No, he did a couple.  Yeah, now every week the remaining contestants are doing, like, commercials.  There's one less every week.  One less every week.  One less person doing the commercial. 
[00:53:00]  This is what the judges had to say.  And, you know, Simon is the only one that is completely honest.  I love this guy.  I didn't want to like this guy because this is the first time that I've watched American Idol this far,  and I thought it was all like, oh, yeah, he's being mean to be mean.  No, he's being real.  And the one who's really not being real is that Ryan Seacrest guy.  Yeah.  He is just god-awful with his fake toughness going after Simon.  It's like, you know what?  Simon's the only one that's being real with these people. 
[00:53:30]  You know, this is a show that's being seen by, what, 40 million Americans?  It's not a little cute little school play where you try to be nice to everybody.  You know what I mean?  This is the real deal.  This is the real world.  These people are really trying to make it in the business.  You have to stand out and look like a complete professional on that stage.  Has Paul Abdul hated anyone yet?  No.  No.  Never.  And Randy Jackson is too scared to actually say what he says, so he's always with the,  you know.  How'd you feel about that, dog? 
[00:54:00]  Well, I would say it's not your.  You're the judge.  Tell me.  I would say it's not your best performance.  You know, but you were having fun up there.  You were having fun up there.  Yeah.  But, you know.  Yeah, why'd they?  He does that a lot.  But I like you.  It's like, ugh.  And Simon is just, he doesn't want to be there.  His arms are folded.  He's laughing, you know, to himself.  It looked like a bad high school performance.  Right.  Well, this is what the judge said about Kevin.  You chose one of my favorite songs of all time. 
[00:54:30]  I love this song.  It's one of my favorite, one of the dog's favorites, dude.  And you know what?  You did a pretty good job of it.  There were a couple of little pitch things in there, but I don't know, dude.  There's some about you.  I see me and you with something, dude.  I just like you, dude.  I like that.  I like you, dude.  You're definitely in the dog pound for real.  Thank you.  Thank you, man.  Oh, this is dog pound.  Shut your face.  It takes a lot of courage to start the song sitting about 10 feet away from Simon.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really does.  And you know what? 
[00:55:00]  What I love about you, Kevin, is you've got more moxie than most people I've ever met  in my entire life.  And that's what's going to carry you on throughout this competition.  People adore you.  No, it's not.  You did another good job tonight.  Thank you.  Hi, Simon.  Kevin.  Yes.  Simon, of course.  I like you.  I know.  And I like you, Simon.  No, I do.  I like you, you know, because you're like a man. 
[00:55:30]  You know, you take it well.  And I'm not going to say it was the best version of that song I've ever heard, because it wasn't.  However, you know, I think, who your audience is.  And I think your audience are going to love that version.  So, thank you.  You talk about how the grannies out there love them.  And I think Simon showed a little heart there, because I think Simon knew he was definitely  going to be gone.  So, it's like, you know what?  I don't need to smash him anymore.  Why am I going to beat him up?  So, I'll be nice, knowing that this is pretty much it for the kid. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  You know, that's what I like about Simon.  And then Ryan has to go up there, and, oh, do you have any constructive criticism for  these contestants?  No.  As Ryan sits there and tries to make them cry, they're getting kicked off.  Ryan is every, he's every guy whose face you want to throw acid in.  His fucking dumb boyish smile and his good teeth, he really makes me sick.  He's making a lot of money.  He certainly is.  He's probably banging a lot of girls.  I'm fiercely jealous. 
[00:56:30]  So, finally, before we move on, we've got Seth Green outside the studio here.  He's going to come in and say hi.  Chris Daughtry, there's a little controversy here.  A little controversy.  Can we play his version of Walk the Line, and then we'll get into the controversy?  I didn't even see this in the paper, so I don't know where you're getting this from,  but you're accurate, Ann.  Opie, I did some investigative reporting of my own here and found this out.  Right.  Via Fox News.  Jimmy, because you're not really watching American Idol, Chris Daughtry,  who Ann and I have no doubt is going to win the whole damn thing. 
[00:57:00]  It's not even a contest anymore.  Is he the band guy?  Yeah.  He's like a rock band.  He's like a rocker kind of guy.  Yeah, he's like an alt-rock singer.  Now, this contest at American Idol is for second place.  Absolutely.  It's for second place.  It's not even close.  If this guy doesn't run away with this, it's a travesty.  Now, every time they mention his name, the whole place just gives him a standing ovation.  Well, whatever.  He's a rock star.  They're cheering like crazy more for him than anybody.  He's got the presence, the look, and the voice, and he just every week runs away with it. 
[00:57:30]  And he did Walk the Line.  The Johnny Cash song?  You know, very, very different version of Walk the Line.  It totally fits his style and everything.  You wouldn't even recognize it as a Johnny Cash song.  He had a little trouble at the beginning with the very low notes in there.  It's very hard to sing very low.  But then at the middle and the end of the song, he brings it home, and it's really good.  Yeah, listen to his version of Walk the Line.  It gave me, like, goosebumps when I was listening to this the other day.  Walk the Line 
[00:58:00]  I find myself alone when each day's through. 
[00:58:30]  Yes, I admit that I'm thankful for you.  Because you're mine, I walk the line.  The sureest night is dark and day is light.  I keep you on my mind both day and night.  And happiness, I don't know who's that it's right.  Because you're mine, I walk the line. 
[00:59:00]  Because you're mine, I walk the line.  Because you're mine, I walk the line, yeah.  You keep me on your side, yeah.  There's nothing I can't hide.  I don't even try to turn the time, yeah. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, I walk the line.  Now, Jimmy, you're a big Johnny Cash fan.  What do you think of that version?  It's unbelievable, right?  And he sounded more like Cash than that fucking Joaquin Phoenix thing.  You're upset.  He is so obsessed with Joaquin Phoenix playing Johnny Cash. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, I love it.  It makes me sick.  You can't let it go.  I never can let that go.  You can't let it go.  And he sounded more like Cash.  However, that version was great, man.  That was great.  That guy's voice is amazing.  That could easily be on the radio tomorrow, right?  Well, this is what the judges said, and then we'll get into the controversy that's starting to hit.  I haven't seen the papers, but Anthony already...  Hey, I'm on top of things.  Anthony might have started this.  I'm on top of things.  He might have started this controversy, actually.  But this is what the judges had to say to Chris Daughtry. 
[01:00:30]  Let me say this.  I don't know if I think it was the best vocals you've done since you've been on the show,  but what I loved about this is that you took a song that everyone knows,  you put a different spin on it, made it an alternative record that fit exactly who you are,  and I love every week that you know exactly who you are, and you never veer from that path.  Amen.  So it's always cool.  Dude, you're ready.  You're ready.  You're ready, baby.  You're ready.  I like that.  Thank you.  There are a few of you American Idols on stage that I wait for every week. 
[01:01:00]  I can't wait to hear what you're going to sing and what you're going to do.  You are so true to who you are, and you don't ever abandon that,  and that's what's so amazing about you, Chris,  and it's like you grow and you grow each week.  I don't even...  He's real, Paula.  You should be already touring, and we should be buying tickets for a concert.  Thank you.  Chris, I agree with Randy. 
[01:01:30]  I don't think it was the best vocal we've heard from you so far, but I don't think it matters,  because there was an enormous difference between what you just did then, which is to take a great song,  make it your own version.  It was completely the opposite to what I hated about Bucky's version of Oh Boy.  And actually, I've got to tell you, I think you are the first artist we've ever had on this show who's actually refused to compromise.  And for that, round of applause.  So the judges obviously loved that version and kept saying how he made it his own. 
[01:02:00]  Little subliminal things going on, too.  Did you hear how Simon called him the first artist on the show?  Like, it's not contestant.  The guy, he called him an artist.  You know, that kind of...  Little things like that get the vote.  It's not like, this guy needs any help, but...  Those little things stick in America's mind when they vote.  It's a great version.  But was it his?  Was it his idea to arrange it that way?  What they did was, they brought in Superfag, Barry Manilow, and he helped arrange... 
[01:02:30]  What is going on?  He seems like a really nice guy, but...  He certainly does.  How much plastic surgery has he had?  I don't know.  There is just something going on with that body.  He's a Brooklyn guy.  You can't totally bash him, but he wrote the songs that made the young girls cry.  Hope he, too.  He wrote the songs.  He wrote the songs.  Mandy.  Uh, yeah.  So, uh...  You came into my life. 
[01:03:00]  He helped arrange some of these songs, because it was 50s.  They had to do songs from the 50s, and different little versions of them.  And then Chris came in and had this idea for Walk the Line, and apparently, um, wasn't quite  his own.  Right.  Um, he says on his website that he's influenced, and, uh, one of the bands that have influenced  him was Live.  And then we find out that Live put out an album a couple of years back with a cover of Walk 
[01:03:30]  the Line on it.  And, uh, there's some similarities there.  Feel a little live.  I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.  I keep my eyes wide open all the time.  I keep the ends out for the tidal vines. 
[01:04:00]  Because you're mine.  I walk the line.  We're getting exactly the same.  I find it very, very easy to be true.  Oops.  I find myself alone when each day is through.  Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you.  Because you're mine.  I walk the line. 
[01:04:30]  It sure is night.  It's dark and day is light.  I keep you on my mind both day and night.  And the happiness I've known proves that it's right.  Because you're mine.  I walk the line.  I walk the line.  I walk the line.  I walk the line. 
[01:05:00]  You've got a way to keep me on your side.  You give me cause for love that I can't hide. 
[01:05:30]  For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide.  Because you're mine.  I walk the line.  Just waiting to see if it kicks in.  I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.  I keep my eyes wide open all the time.  They get a little longer arrangement, too, you know?  Yeah.  I keep the ends out for the tide that binds.  Because you're mine.  I walk the line. 
[01:06:00]  Because you're mine.  I walk the line.  Because you're mine.  I walk the line.  I walk the line. 
[01:06:30]  So, obviously, very similar to what he did on American Idol the other night.  He really, like, brought it home and rocked it out a lot more.  I gotta tell you.  But the arrangement is the same.  It's the same arrangement, but Chris Daughtry on American Idol did it better.  Did it better, yeah.  Did it better, proving how talented this kid is.  I disagree.  And does he have to tell the judges where that came from?  Hmm.  No. 
[01:07:00]  They were just complimenting him, and he was just nodding away.  Was it his place to go, well, I got that arrangement from live?  And does it matter in the end?  Probably not, right?  I like lives better.  I gotta be honest.  I like lives better.  You like Chris's?  Yeah, but I like lives better.  Well, Chris threw it together in a day, though.  I think I like Chris Daughtry's version better.  Yeah.  Because he really rocks it out, man.  Yeah, you'll take cash, obviously.  I like Joaquin, actually.  His version was the best out of all of them.  Yeah, Joaquin's version of Walk the Line in the movie was unbelievable, Jimmy.  Was it? 
[01:07:30]  We got Seth Green.  So there's the controversy with the American Idol.  I don't know.  We'll see where it goes.  I don't think it's going to go anywhere.  But it's just interesting to know that Live did that song, and actually no one cared, because  I never heard that on the radio.  No.  Not one of their big hits.  Seth, sorry to make you wait.  You're a bunch of jerks.  Yeah, you know.  Sitting outside just thinking of ways to hurt you guys.  And we're just babbling about American Idol like everyone else isn't.  I know.  Well, that's the problem. 
[01:08:00]  Sometimes we get into something that's a little long form, and then you see someone  sitting out there like, oh my god, you can't let Seth Green sit around waiting.  It's completely outrageous.  Don't you know who I am?  God, it's so entertaining out there, too.  As we just babble about nothing.  Just get to sit and look in the window of the show you should be on already.  I was actually really engaged in the debate.  Yeah.  You wise ant.  Yeah.  Do you watch American Idol, though?  I do, I do.  What do you think?  I like it.  Who do you think is going to win?  I got my top four picked out.  You do?  Yeah.  I like that girl, Mandisa.  I think she's got one of the best voices. 
[01:08:30]  I don't know if she could win it, but she's amazing.  She really is amazing.  And that girl, Paris, is great, too.  I love Paris.  Yeah, she's really good.  She came out looking like a 40s kind of singer.  Did a great job.  There's some singers that you see on that show that are just great singers.  They're like effortless performers, and you think, oh, okay, well, regardless of whether  or not you win, this is kind of what you do.  So Paris is like that.  I like that girl, Catherine McPhee, too.  She gets better and better.  Yeah, she's coming out of nowhere, right?  Well, I mean, she was like the cutest one in the initial runoffs, and she kissed everybody 
[01:09:00]  on the mouth and then went outside and like, ooh-la-la, I kissed everybody.  She's just so cute.  And then she's a good singer, too, and I like that guy, Chris.  I think that guy's amazing.  He's unbelievable.  What about Taylor Hicks?  I like Taylor Hicks, too, but I don't think he'll make top four.  No.  No, no, at some point, they're going to have to throw him out.  It's such a popularity contest in a way up until people start getting into the finals.  When you get down to the bottom bottom, there's only a couple people that are really so blow  you out of the water talented that they're going to make it to final four. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, it's not like you want to throw certain people off, but you have to.  Somebody's got to go.  People have to get cut no matter how cool or interesting or sympathetic they are.  You also have to have a personality, you know, because what's-his-name is one of the best  singers.  I forget his name every week.  Ivan?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Elliot, I mean.  Yeah, see, I said Ivan.  I forget, and I know everyone else's name, but his personality hasn't really shown much  personality.  But he has an amazing, amazing voice.  Unbelievable voice, right?  But in the end, I don't think they're going to kick him off because he doesn't have that  personality. 
[01:10:00]  Bucky's got to go.  Yeah, Bucky's just...  Bucky's got to go.  I don't know.  Bucky's got to stand with his legs together.  Yeah, he does that squatting like he's taking a dump on the stage thing.  That Justin Guarini I just got off a horse walk.  Kelly Pickler does that, too.  She does the little squatting thing.  That's a little weird.  Kelly Pickler's going to have to go, too.  I don't really mind with her, though.  I think she's super cute.  She's adorable.  That's why she's on.  That's why she's on.  It's not her voice, really.  But she does have a pretty amazing voice, and she's never had any formal training.  She's never taken a lesson.  She's never, like...  No training in anything, by the way. 
[01:10:30]  She opens that yap of hers.  Look at the pickle sign.  What's that?  What's that?  She's just a really sweet, simple girl, though.  Yeah, yeah.  They told us she was something last night, and she goes, what's that?  Again, and they go, we don't have time tonight.  Look, we only have a half hour.  She's ballsy.  We can't explain this to you today.  What's a ballsy?  Oh, that's what it was.  Ballsy.  Ballsy, I'm a girl.  What I'd like to be dipping into your mouth like a teabag.  So, yeah, that's where we're at. 
[01:11:00]  So, we were talking about American Idol.  Sweet.  And then the South Park episode.  I'm not on American Idol.  No, you're not.  You're on three shows, though.  Wait, what are you guys talking about?  The South Park was really...  I haven't seen it yet, but we just played some most close to it.  They ripped apart, Chef, literally, and Scientology, you know, some very cutting-edge wit over there.  I love it.  It is tough with that, but I think those guys are doing some of the most relevant and astute social commentary in the last few years.  It's just the most unbiased and cut-to-the-bone. 
[01:11:30]  No matter what's happening, they can jump on it and just slay it and not look like hypocrites or assholes.  And it's done in such a clever, funny way.  They're brilliant, man.  Did you guys see the Global Warming episode they did?  Yeah.  I thought it was amazing.  It's so funny.  They know how to take whatever's going on in the news.  And this whole Chef thing and Scientology is a week, you know, a week and a half, and they throw these things together, and they're brilliant. 
[01:12:00]  It's nice to have that kind of turnaround, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you have...  Three shows.  Three shows on.  You've got three shows.  Well, technically, I'm just doing the one right now, Robot Chicken.  Right.  I'm a full-time production.  But you've got the Family Guy's on.  Family Guy's easy breezy, though.  I come in like once a month and record a couple of episodes at a time, and I tell people this, and nobody really believes me.  And I don't think it's any lack of professionalism, but I don't read the scripts for Family Guy.  Right.  So it's just lines.  Yeah.  I just walk in.  I do the lines. 
[01:12:30]  You have someone that says, yeah, Seth's got to be sad.  Yeah, Seth MacFarlane is like sitting through the other side of the booth.  I'm like, all right, so this is a...  What am I doing?  I just walked in.  I just walked in.  And who?  Somebody's yelling at me.  Oh, no, man.  Yeah.  You know.  That's it.  And that way, I get to watch the show like a fan.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Because I think the show is really funny.  And the less I know, the better.  And then I watch it.  I have no recollection of recording my dialogue.  I was going to ask you, are you completely surprised sometimes?  Like, oh, I thought I would have been in this situation during that line.  Now, I just, I don't even think about it from like a personal perspective. 
[01:13:00]  I'm like, the show's so funny.  That's it.  I told you last time, too, Chris is my favorite character on Family Guy.  Oh, thanks, man.  Everyone starts with the obvious ones, but then I'm all about Chris now.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And then you're doing Four Kings as well.  No, we got canceled.  Oh, I'm sorry.  When did that happen?  Two days ago.  Well, maybe we should update this.  Turn the page.  Give me a pencil.  No.  You know what?  It's one of those tough things because, like, it's a four-camera show in a tough client. 
[01:13:30]  Like, TV these days is really hard to launch new shows.  Yeah.  I mean, that's why we're excited that we're going to have any kind of success because it's  just a format, though.  Yeah.  You know, it's a simple show, and it's just about people, and it's, I don't know.  We were up against that.  My girlfriend watched it all the time.  She loved it.  She's a huge fan.  You know, a lot of, Buffy, fucking Buffy, fucking Seth.  You're dating a weird Aborigine parrot person?  You're like a radio personality, man. 
[01:14:00]  You should trade up.  Get yourself a hot girl.  Maybe I shouldn't do that voice.  She watched it, though, and thought it was very funny and everything.  Well, most of the nation was watching Dancing with the Stars or Survivor.  So, oh, they gave you that slot?  Yeah, that slot.  That was nice of them.  I know.  It was sweet.  Jesus Christ.  What goes through it?  How do you compete with Dancing with the Stars?  I don't know.  It's really taking the nation by storm.  You should have waltzed or tangoed on your show a little more.  I'm a huge fan of pop culture.  I couldn't sit through that dance with the stars or whatever the hell it's called.  Yeah, but our culture has become really celebrity obsessed, and they kind of will accept any 
[01:14:30]  grade of celebrity if they're given inside access into their behind-the-scenes life, which  is always some produced version of it anyway.  But, I mean, that's a whole other conversation.  My concerns for our nation's future.  How is that when they tell you a show is canceled?  Did you see it coming?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, we knew that it was kind of underperforming against all this competition, and NBC is a 
[01:15:00]  little hair-triggered because they're in the third place of the networks right now.  Yep.  When you're up against the ropes, you either pull out amazing successes or you cut and run,  and that's kind of what they did, which is, you know, it happens all the time.  But I texted all the boys the second I found out.  I'm like, all right, you guys ready for a good cry?  Oh, no.  We're going to get together on Saturday and drink our sorrows away.  But it's tough with any kind of show because I've been working so long, I've been doing  so much stuff that the business doesn't threaten me in the same way. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  So if a show gets canceled, I'm like, oh, that's a shame.  We had a lot of fun doing that.  Oh, well.  Well, next, let's see what else we did.  Yeah, you got something.  On to the next project.  I've worked with all the same people over and over again, so it don't feel like the end  of summer camp where you think you're never going to see somebody again.  It's just, it's a little bit more permanent for me.  Yeah.  I hope, I hope.  We can commiserate.  And commiserate, I mean, when I was told that XFL Game Day was canceled, Opie, was that  a hell of a...  We were on NBC as well, Seth.  We got something in common with you.  Yeah, yeah.  I understand.  When we were told after three or four episodes that... 
[01:16:00]  That the XFL just wasn't sticking with the country.  Yeah.  Not only was...  It's like, we got good news and bad news.  Your show's being canceled, but it's because the entire league is being canceled.  We don't need a pregame show for a game that isn't happening.  At least that's what they told us to make us feel good.  That is a kind of consolation, though.  Yeah, it made us feel a little better.  That was our network TV experience.  And of course, they had to pay us, which is also a good thing.  How many did we sign on for?  Pay us.  That's right.  I think we made four.  I think we had four episodes.  Did we have four? 
[01:16:30]  Do you laugh at the newbies when they go through this cancellation process?  No, it's not something you laugh at, because I've been fired from jobs.  I've had important stuff yanked away from me.  Behind their backs?  It's always...  Oh, yeah.  Behind their backs.  I'm like, you guys suffer green and jerks.  Good luck, virgins.  No, it's...  I mean, everybody's already working on something else, so it's just more of a sting, because  you get together with a group of people, and you really get on with each other and are  funny together, and you're like, oh, good, this feels great.  We could do this for a while.  Well, you got the robot chicken that's getting a nice cult following. 
[01:17:00]  But, man, the coolest thing about this show is it's just...  I mean, you know Matt.  So, I mean, my buddy and I just made this show and made it for the internet and then put  it on TV, and now it's on the Cartoon Network.  Well, you were...  We averaged, like, over a million viewers, and it's mind-blowing.  The first time you came in here, you were promoting that, and you really believed in it.  It was really cool to see.  I still do.  Yes, absolutely, and now it's growing like crazy.  And you do, what, like 50 of the voices or something crazy like that? 
[01:17:30]  Kind of.  It's not on purpose.  I mean, our sketches are so short format.  We'll have, like, a two- or three-second sketch, so our entire script is made up of, like,  30 two- and three-second sketches, and it's one or two lines, so you can't bring in a SAG  actor for that.  We can only afford, like, five actors, and legally, each one can only do three voices, so that's  15 characters.  So, anything else in the show, I have to do.  And it's a lot of, like, look out!  Oh, no!  You know?  It's a lot of that.  I mean, it sounds more impressive to say I'm 60 characters, but in essence, it's a lot 
[01:18:00]  of, like, get your heads out of there.  You know?  Wait, how come they can only do three?  Is it like a SAG rule?  Yeah.  They can only do three voices?  Yeah.  Or you have to pay extra.  We just don't have it.  So we don't have that kind of money.  So he does all the voices.  I do quite a bit.  Let me just stick this in the face of your audience, though, that our DVD is coming out on March  28th.  Ah, the DVD.  The DVD, man.  It's the wave of the future.  Well, for guys like us, who are big old DVD geeks, this is a super DVD, because we just 
[01:18:30]  went nuts on it.  It's ours.  So we just, like, grabbed everything that we could.  And it's not a bunch of...  Can you guys swear on the air?  Yeah.  So it's not a bunch of bullshit on the DVD.  It's just, like, solid fun stuff.  A lot of technical information.  A lot of how-to information.  What's the coolest thing on there?  What is the coolest thing on there?  Even if it's really geeky.  Just the coolest thing to you.  We made a deal with Sony to put some of our original webisodes on, which a lot of people  asked us about.  And it's not the best.  It's sure as hell not the best material. 
[01:19:00]  But you can see the growth of the show.  And then we did commentary for every episode.  We got a bunch of cool people to do guest commentary.  And there's really nothing.  Oh, yeah, because we shot so much for the first season and then kept having to edit.  There's mounds of, like, deleted material.  So all these jokes you didn't see, channel flips and sketches and animatics that never  got filmed, all this awesome, awesome stuff.  I heard some of your commentary on some Buffy DVDs and thought it was really funny. 
[01:19:30]  Like, you guys were goofing on the episodes.  You came to a point where you're, like, goofing on the characters, on your own character.  It's like, oh, here he comes again, all, you know, full of emotion.  Oh, that was funny.  I got to do that with Joss Whedon and Marty Hoxon, like, two years after I was off the  show.  We came to do the commentary.  Yeah, you commented on that, too.  The fact that it was so long between doing those.  And I think that worked out better because it gave you kind of a fresh look at the episodes. 
[01:20:00]  They hadn't seen any of it in a while.  And we hadn't gotten to hang out in a while.  So it was a nice reunion.  Yeah.  And we all just had a good time.  And it wasn't like you were taking it so seriously.  No.  Like, a lot of people, when they get to do the commentary and take it, well, I really  had to study this character.  You know, she helped me as a person grow my character.  Shut up.  That's the awkward thing about commentary, though, especially in the producerial side  of it.  We're responsible for giving all of, like, the cool, technical, oh, when it was difficult  to broker this deal kind of commentary.  I just like to screw around. 
[01:20:30]  So at one point, on one of the episodes, you just hear our writer, Doug Goldstein, make  some comment.  I'm like, all right, that's it.  And I just jumped across the table and started, like, smacking him.  So, keep it interesting.  Let's go to the phones.  A lot of people want to say hi to Seth Green.  Prodigal son, what's up?  Hey.  I just wanted to kiss Seth Green's ass a little.  Robot chicken is fucking brilliant.  Tell your friends.  Buy a DVD.  I'm gonna. 
[01:21:00]  I'm gonna.  Thanks, man.  I thought, I've seen the promo for, uh, they had one that was a spoof on the commercial,  This Is Your Brain on Drugs with a Chick with a Fryin' Pan.  Yeah.  That had me in stitches every single time I seen it.  Sweet.  Thanks, man.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Watch it out.  Are you a geek, though, when it comes to that?  You know, I'm a geek in the way that I know.  All of the stuff that becomes the content for our show. 
[01:21:30]  Like, I've got this bizarre sponge-like absorption of pop culture.  Yeah.  So.  So, that's pretty geeky.  Computers, you into that?  No, man.  I hate computers.  No, no, no.  I really do.  Like, I like computers for the music aspect of it.  I love burning CDs and being able to store all my music.  Yeah.  No, no.  I buy it.  I actually, I'm actually one of the purists.  I like to buy the CD and get the liner notes and see all the pictures and read the dedications.  That's, you know.  But everybody's got their own thing.  Very cool.  Let's say hi to Trey in Georgia. 
[01:22:00]  Trey, what's up today?  Man, I was just wondering, where do you come up with the ideas for Robot Chicken?  Because it's the best show Cartoon Network has.  And are there plans on increasing it to a 30-minute show?  Let me try and take these one by one.  So, where do the ideas come up?  We all sit around in a room, basically.  Me and Tom Root and Doug Goldstein and Matt Senreich and Mike Fasolo.  And then this season, we wrote 20 episodes over 20 weeks.  So, for each five-week period, we brought in two additional writers to sit in the room 
[01:22:30]  with us for a period of five weeks and write five episodes.  And we just all sat around like, what's funny to you?  And a couple things that we hit on.  And I was like, man, have you seen those Burger King commercials with the big creepy mask?  I was like, we've got to do something with that.  So, we did something with that.  It's like that.  We literally just, what makes you laugh?  What do you think is funny?  And then we spitball it in the room and see if we've got a joke or not.  And then there are no plans to increase it to 30 minutes.  And I'll tell you why.  This is one of the hardest jobs I've ever had in my entire life.  And I've had some hard jobs. 
[01:23:00]  But this is a 46-week schedule to produce 20 15-minute episodes.  Take that in.  46 weeks.  That's like literally just shy of an entire year.  So, I'm going to finish up June 17th on this season.  And it is every day, all day, and a ton of work.  So, no.  God damn.  How did you fit in the TV show?  It was really hard.  I would wind up going to Four Kings at like 8 in the morning.  And then we would rehearse until 1.30.  And then we'd have a network run through and split at 2 o'clock. 
[01:23:30]  Get right to Robot Chicken at 2 o'clock and work until about 6 or 8.  Did the NBC executives be like, could you maybe take a little time off from your little cartoony fun channel thing?  We balanced the schedule really well.  But nobody quite appreciated what it was that I'm making.  But that's fine.  And it's such a small kind of culty thing.  And I like the fact that it's not – I like the fact that it still has a kind of subversive underground quality, even though we got Melanie Griffith on this year.  I'm just saying.  That's pretty cool. 
[01:24:00]  Let's go to Brad in Mississippi.  Hey, Brad.  What's up?  Good morning, boys.  How are you?  Pretty good, Brad.  Brad.  I'm also calling to kiss Steph on his ass.  I found him when I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  I thought he did a great job then.  And I watch Robot Chicken religiously.  Aw, thanks, man.  And I kiss my pants almost every week when I watch it.  Have we got an Easter egg for you?  I've got a question, though.  And I'm not sure if you're affiliated with it.  Do you have anything to do with the 12-ounce mouse program? 
[01:24:30]  No, you know, but I saw the pilot of that, and I called Matt Malero, and I just told him I thought it was really funny and wanted to do a voice on it if that ever became possible.  And that's as far as that got.  But I think Matt writes that.  Somebody else writes it with him, but it's so weird and funny.  It's such a funny show, but it's so weird.  I mean, it never kind of grabs you, and you hang on to it, but you don't know where in the hell it's going.  I know what you're talking about.  I watched the pilot episode, and I forced a bunch of people to watch it just because I thought it was so silly and funny. 
[01:25:00]  And then I made a big overture calling Matt and being like, your show is the greatest.  And then he sent me like three, four more episodes.  And by the end of the fourth episode, I was like, I have no idea where you're going with this.  All right.  Thanks, boys.  Have a good vacation.  Thank you, man.  You live here in New York?  No, I've been living in L.A.  L.A.?  A while now, yeah.  But I got a place here.  That's kind of different than New York.  I'm just wondering because you're pretty recognizable.  Yeah, yeah.  But New York's a better place to be.  Is it?  It really is, man. 
[01:25:30]  I mean, aside from any kind of paparazzi in New York, you're on the move, and everybody's  got something to do.  That's true.  Everybody's doing something else.  So even if somebody spots you, it's only so long.  For a second.  For a second.  I know.  Like, I'll be on the street, and they'll be like, hey, Seth Green.  And I'll be like, hey, how you doing?  They're like, yeah, all right.  And then the light changes, and they're gone.  I've seen bleeding glimpses of, like, Aretha Franklin, and you.  He is so right.  I saw you walking down the street one day, and I came home, and I was like, yeah, I saw  Seth Green walking down the street.  And that's as much as you do.  But in L.A., it's like, oh my gosh, my opportunity. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  So everybody wants to talk to you, wants to give you their script, wants to sell you  something, wants to, like, hang out and go to parties with you.  L.A. people come there to be doing what it is that you're doing.  Yeah.  So it's very different.  New York, somebody's already doing something.  I just saw Rick Moranis the other day, and he was on his cell phone.  I'm like, wow, Rick Moranis.  And then I forgot, because I was like, oh, I've got to go get milk.  You're on your way somewhere.  You're not just walking the streets of Manhattan.  Even if I want to be a stalker, I don't have time to follow Rick Moranis. 
[01:26:30]  I've got to get my milk in my papers.  But nobody walks in California.  Like, you drive to a specific location, and then you hang out there.  So there's a lot more opportunity for people.  So if you're not in a car, you're there.  You're doing the hang.  You're already there.  Wherever you're standing, you're going to be there for a while.  Exactly.  So you have more of an opportunity to sign for.  I found L.A. to be really boring, man.  Like, it's cool when you're doing a gig.  It's a fun hang, but it's like, just at night, it just stinks.  L.A. literally shuts down at midnight.  And that's a big misconception.  You'd think it would be party town, you know? 
[01:27:00]  You know, there's your undergrounds, but it's always more people checking each other out than having fun together.  I like to get my friends together and have private stuff because, you know, it feels more normal.  It feels like the type of stuff you'd be interested in doing.  Yeah.  As opposed to hanging out in clubs and watching each other look at each other.  Hey, a lot of people want us to ask you about the Seacrest Outbit.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What do they want to know?  Well, they just want you to talk about it because for the people that don't know about Robot Chicken, that's one of the standout bits, right? 
[01:27:30]  You know, I've met Ryan Seacrest a bunch, and Ryan Seacrest takes it on the chin all day long.  People call him a tool and a douche and all this stuff.  We just did.  My favorite thing about Ryan, have you guys ever met him?  No.  Ryan's a class act because he just doesn't give a fuck, man.  He really doesn't.  He's like, yeah, I know.  I know that's what people think of me.  I could not be more successful, though.  Literally, he's like, I tried and it's impossible.  I'm at maximum success capacity.  So, it's great.  And then I approached him about making fun of himself on our show, and he's like, yes, absolutely. 
[01:28:00]  And it's kind of like, in a way, what Wayne Brady did on Chappelle's show.  You take people's conception of you, and you twist it in just a certain way by showing that you're aware of the way that people perceive you, and you don't care.  Carson Daly is good at that, too.  Yeah, Carson's very self-deprecating.  He played off being a tool very well.  But I approached Ryan about, because we were doing an American Idol parody, and I had to go through all this clearance to get him on the show playing himself in that format. 
[01:28:30]  And then while we were there, we were like, Ryan, we wrote a series of channel flips screwing with the Seacrest Out idea.  Would you mind listening to them?  And he just thought they were funny.  So, it starts with him on the set of American Idol saying, Seacrest Out.  And that's all it is.  Just flip like that.  And then the second one is him playing baseball, and he swings and a miss, and it's like, Seacrest Out!  And then I think the last one is him in a dress in front of a mirror posing really pretty, and he goes, Seacrest Out!  I love him for that.  I think it's really, really smart and telling of his level of confidence that he's willing to do stuff like that. 
[01:29:00]  Some people are so serious, they do not even want to put themselves in that light, and they don't realize how endearing it is to people to kind of be a little self-deprecating.  It's tough, though, because if you're in the midst, like, okay, I approached Jay Statham about doing a spoof of the Transporter on our show,  and they're still making Transporter movies.  So, it doesn't exactly behoove him to, in the midst of launching another movie, kind of make fun of how outrageous it is.  I get that.  I get that.  Yeah, that makes sense. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Maybe later.  It just depends on the circumstance.  I like those movies, by the way.  Yeah, they're cool.  Very cool.  That's why we wanted to make fun of him.  No kidding.  All right, we got to take a break.  Yes, we do.  We haven't, we started at seven.  We haven't taken a break yet.  Do you guys have to pee or something?  Yeah.  See, that's, yeah, we have to take leaks.  Okay.  We have to take leaks.  My bladder's full.  If you want to hang, you're more than welcome.  If you've got other places to go, we understand that, too.  What time is it?  It's like 8.30.  How are we on time?  Ten minutes.  Okay, cool.  I got ten minutes.  Oh, we're going to break for at least ten minutes. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, good.  Well, then it's been great, guys.  Buy the DVD on the 28th.  How about this?  Let's get the plugs in.  If you're here, that's cool.  If not, that's cool, too.  Sounds great.  So, it's Robot Chicken, the DVD.  Robot Chicken Season 1 DVD is all over the place on March 28th.  Right.  Couldn't be more excited.  Oh, and on April 12th, the Softbound edition of The Freshman, which is the comic that I  put out, is coming out in, like, bookstores and Amazon.  So, if you didn't get to read it when it was a comic, you can read it as the graphic novel.  You've got to slow down a little bit, man. 
[01:30:30]  You're like an overachiever, I think.  You know what it is?  As I get any kind of success, I'm able to employ really talented people.  Like, I'm able to give opportunities to people who are super talented, who don't get to put  their stuff out there.  So, I wrote this book with a friend of mine, Hugh Servikoff, who's a brilliant writer.  And he wrote six issues in this comic.  And we got to put it out and tour it.  That's pretty cool.  And now we're getting to put a book out.  It's like this best friend of mine who we grew up reading and writing fake comic books 
[01:31:00]  together.  Now we get to make a real one.  Are you going to be directing anything?  I see you have a director's beard on, is what I'm...  Now, for me, I have really thick facial hair and it's a pain in the ass to shave.  So, I just don't shave if I don't have to.  That's like one day, right?  But I direct a lot of the cartoon.  You do?  Yeah, you know, if you're going to direct something, you're literally marrying yourself  to it for several years.  You've got to just be in love with it.  I haven't found any kind of film project that I'm so in love with that I need to direct 
[01:31:30]  it.  Do you have...  I always wondered how that happens.  Is it just actors picking up what directors show them?  Or do you have to kind of read Dummy's Guide to Directing?  I think there's...  Because a lot of actors go over to it.  Some are good.  Some aren't.  I think there are just really different methods of it.  I mean, for me, I've been acting since I was seven years old and I've been around some  amazing people.  So, I've had the opportunity to watch.  Just the technical part of directing would seem like you would have to go to school to  learn that shit.  Yeah.  Or like I said, I spent like 25 years doing this now. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  I paid close attention at one point.  I just started paying attention to the way things got done.  Asking questions to the DP and seeing the way lighting affects the scene.  You know, you just start paying attention to the details.  It is funny when you tune in a movie or something and just go, look, it's Seth Green.  And it took you like a couple of minutes to figure it out because you're like three.  That's really good.  That's got to be odd for you though because for us, you really got to like plug in a home  movie or something to see yourself as a kid and you could just be rallying around the  channels and there I am at like seven. 
[01:32:30]  And you're like, oh, that haircut was in though when I did this movie.  Give me a break.  We can hide all those pictures.  No, not me.  It's chronicle.  But at least I can pretend that it was a part.  Yeah, Macaulay Culkin and I became good friends after working together and he and I talked  a lot about that because as you get older, who you were as a kid feels like such a separate  person.  It's almost like a lifetime ago.  It's just almost like this kid that you sort of are vaguely familiar with.  You inherited a bunch of money from.  Wow.  What a great way to put it, man.  It's like, yeah, you seem like a nice guy. 
[01:33:00]  Thanks for setting me up.  Jesus, that is so goddamn funny.  That's a great way to put it.  That's good.  I look at other people and you think of them as different entities than they used to be.  I think Shatner's one of them.  You look at Star Trek Shatner and Shatner now, it's not even the same person.  Well, because he finally accepted who he was and that set him free.  It's like the resisting being known for Captain Kirk kept him from having any kind of additional  career.  Whereas like John Travolta, when he came out in Pulp Fiction, first thing he did was host 
[01:33:30]  SNL and make fun of Saturday Night Fever and Welcome Back, Cotter and all the stuff that  everybody knew him for.  So people were like, oh yeah, I remember that soon.  He's like, yeah, that was me.  I'm doing this now.  If you acknowledge where you came from and just keep moving forward, people will go with  you, hopefully.  Well, Shatner had that whole incident, too.  That kind of wipes his slate clean once you've been on the news for having, you know...  Almost murdered your wife?  Oh, Jesus.  The whole, like, you know, I took a nap and then called 911 once she was fucking caught  in a grate.  I wanted to jump in the pool, but I'm really, really scared of the dark. 
[01:34:00]  It was cold.  All right.  Let's thank Seth Green for stopping by.  Robot Chicken.  Thanks, man.  It's March 28th.  March 28th.  And then April 12th for that book.  Very cool.  That's Seth Green, everyone.  We're going to go take leaks.  Take our leaks.  Hey, butt crack. 
[01:34:30]  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The one virus spreading across America.  And we couldn't be happier.  Girl on Pal Talk with Ben Sparks glasses on.  Just showed her butt crack.  Very nice.  Gotta love the Pal Talk.  I guess Dice is killing me on Stern right now.  Really? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, my fucking God.  Oh, Dice is killing you on Stern's show.  Like, seven minutes now on how you, not Anthony, sucks.  Impossible.  Impossible for Dice to kill you.  I hope you're taping Howard's show.  Dice is going off on O.P.  He thinks Anthony should be a stand-up comic and O.P. is a zero.  Can't do anything without bourbon.  What a dick.  What?  So I drink.  Everyone knows I don't drink.  You drink?  Dice is on Stern is totally bashing O.P. right now.  I heard that Dice is on Stern's show trashing you fellas. 
[01:35:30]  Time to put the bitch slap on this motherfucker.  Stupid Dice.  That's tearing you up on Howard right now.  There you go.  Dice is trashing O.P. on Stern right now.  What a dick.  There you go.  Well, Stern's been a loyal friend to him over the years.  What a complete lack of any type of loyalty or friendship or anything.  The guy does not know how to be a human being. 
[01:36:00]  You put yourself out there.  Get that clip.  Get the clip of him crying on Arsenio.  That's too bad.  That's actually too bad.  And trying to use the divide and conquer.  Oh, boy.  Well, everyone knows I suck.  I've been doing radio since I was 18.  One day they'll realize I suck and I won't be doing this anymore.  What can I tell you?  What can I tell you?  O.P.  Shh.  You're going to ruin it.  God, that's just, eh, whatever. 
[01:36:30]  No surprise.  I should be a stand-up comic so I could tour with you and get fucked over like everybody  else that's toured with you, Dice.  Like every other comic.  Let every other comic talk about what it's like to tour with Dice and what a disloyal piece  of shit he is.  Just stop.  I hung with him in L.A.  He would call me, I don't know, two, three times a week easily.  And I'd be on the phone with him for hours on end. 
[01:37:00]  Hours on end.  I'm not going to trash the guy.  The guy liked me.  He called me all the time.  When I went to L.A., we hung.  He took me to his gym.  He took me to his apartment that he had to rent after he got separated.  After I got dumped.  We climbed a mountain together and he gave me advice on my career and our careers after  we fucked up, talked about his MTV experience.  I have no idea what I could have possibly done to him for him to just decide to completely 
[01:37:30]  kill me on Stern today.  Nothing.  Seriously.  It's him trying to get an in again with Stern.  There should be a DeLorean should pull up in front of Sirius right now because it is  1986, isn't it?  Isn't it over there?  What year is it that Dice is on Howard?  Two fucking has-beens trying to rekindle something, a magic that is so long gone.  Please.  You hear better things coming out of Kinnison's tombstone. 
[01:38:00]  There it is.  Well, we have a Dice on the show today.  Dice.  Oh, Howard, it's great to be here.  Isn't it wonderful?  Hey, tragedy about the space shuttle blowing up, huh?  Ain't that awful?  That happened yesterday.  Hey, this new movie, Back to the Future, is great.  Oh!  It's over.  It's 2006. 
[01:38:30]  My God.  Enough.  Hey, I caught an episode and not necessarily the news.  That's a funny show.  Did you, Dice?  Let's see if Howard gets him back into Madison Square Garden.  Yeah, go ahead.  Get him into the garden.  Dice had tears in his eyes as he was thanking me.  Thanking me personally, going, hey, dude, if it wasn't for you and Anthony,  I would have never played the garden again.  Someone back me up here, because this is the reality.  I'm not going to go off and just do the expected and yell and scream and trash Dice. 
[01:39:00]  I'll just keep it real.  The guy had tears in his eyes.  He said, you don't understand how much this means to me to play the garden again,  because the first time I played the garden, my sons were either, A, not born,  or, B, too young to enjoy it.  I think they weren't born.  I don't know exactly.  And he goes, and he's pointing to his sons as they're on the stage going,  oh, my God, look, look, they get to see their father at Madison Square Garden.  This is a dream come true.  And then he's like, come here, come here.  I want to take a picture of me and you. 
[01:39:30]  And there's a picture of me and Dice with an empty garden after everyone left,  and there's basically tears in his eyes.  And, like, he wasn't the Dice that everyone knows.  He was, like, being Dice the human being, going,  you gave me something that I could never, never, never pay you back for.  Come over here now.  You, take a picture with me.  You gave to me something that I gave.  I'm choking up over here. 
[01:40:00]  Hey, Doc Brown, I need a DeLorean with the 20,000 Hoosier Jiggy Watts thing over here  so I could be over there.  See, I'm a big, fat fucking husband now.  I need the DeLorean to go over there now and be the young Dice that was relevant.  Okay?  Now send me, give me the lightning.  See, when the clock gets struck, the lightning, I go over here. 
[01:40:30]  Over here now.  And I'm popular again.  And I'm going on Stern.  Can you do that for me?  No?  No.  It's over.  The glory days are gone, you fuck.  Let's go to Kerry in Vegas.  Kerry, what's up?  Hey, unfortunately, my new Durango has Sirius that Dodge pays for, so I switched over.  Dice is talking a whole different bunch of shit, man.  He's saying that, yo, I'm not going to go on their show and make another show for them. 
[01:41:00]  They can do it on their own this time.  And how you, he tried to take you on after the garden thing to see what you had verbally.  He's a fucking...  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  You never understand what he's talking about.  You know, we'll just keep it real.  The guy called me all the time.  We had great conversations in the middle of the night.  I have messages from Dice going, hey, you there?  You're there?  You're usually there at this time.  He's a phony. 
[01:41:30]  All right.  Well, call me back.  All right.  I'll wait a little longer in case you're making your way to the phone.  You know, the guy loved me.  What can I tell you?  I'm being honest.  The guy loved me.  We talked all the time.  When I went to L.A., I stopped by and saw him at the comedy store.  We hung.  You know, he...  We've all know Howard's full of shit.  Anybody on the show is full of shit.  And you guys are the only ones that still have anything worth of shit to listen to. 
[01:42:00]  That's why I got an XM unit mounted next to this piece of shit serious unit.  But, hey, thanks to Howard, I know they can switch the brain.  So as soon as I get a chance, I'm going to switch the brain to an XM unit in my car.  All right.  So we can listen to you because, God, you know, he comes out here and he's a legend, according to all the billboards.  The legend.  Yeah.  He's an artifact.  It's easy to yell and scream, but, you know, I'll take it down to, you know, man to man.  The guy is a complete and utter phony. 
[01:42:30]  People warned us about this for many years.  I'm like, you know what?  The guy seems pretty real to me.  He's calling me and we have a pretty good friendship.  He thanked me for, you know, for pretty much selling out the garden.  And I did that for him.  It was game five of the World Series against the Yankees and the Mets.  And he still did unbelievable business at the garden.  And he said, if it wasn't for you guys, this would not have happened.  He knows this.  Even better business than showed because, I mean, now you can say it.  The Beacon was six days before. 
[01:43:00]  Sold out Beacon, 3,000 seats.  Yep.  And those were going to get dumped.  That show is going to be canceled.  And those people were going to be flipped into the garden.  Yep.  Which would have been an extra 3,000 people in the garden.  And then the promoter would allow that.  I'm sure he's going to rewrite history.  But the fact is he told us that we made all that happen for him.  He told us.  So what?  He's going to go on Howard and trash me personally just to sell a few more tickets for his gig on Long Island?  Good luck.  That's worth it to you, Dice? 
[01:43:30]  Good luck.  That's worth it in the long run?  There's a bigger audience here.  I'm sure your sons are real proud of their papa today.  Good one, Dice.  Good choice.  Good choice you made there, Dice.  Have fun.  I'm sure your sons that you love more than anything are proud of their papa today.  Hey, want to give them a plug?  Maybe the pests want to go see them at Governor's.  Is it Governor's?  I didn't even know.  It's going to be at Governor's this weekend.  On Long Island?  Yep.  There you go. 
[01:44:00]  The garden to governors.  Have fun.  Have fun.  Pests.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Heckle till you get thrown out.  Heckle till you get thrown out.  Fuck this guy.  Fuck him.  And the divine and conquer.  I mean, people have been trying that for years.  Keep trying it.  It's not going to go anywhere.  Keith in Ohio.  Yeah, I just wanted to give you a quick call and say, hey, some of us out here love you  and love what you do.  I love Anthony and Jimmy as well, but your control over the radio show keeps things flowing great, 
[01:44:30]  and believe me, I'm one of those that notices how you rein things in when it's getting out  there.  Dice should know because he's one of the people that when he was on the show, that show was  so easily derailed when he was on because he'd just go off on tangents, and it had to  be kept reined in and kept together, but, you know.  Yeah, I've missed the early years.  I've only been with you since you went free on XM, and I've only missed a couple of hours 
[01:45:00]  of shows since you went free, so I'd really love to catch up on the early days, but, yeah,  I just wanted to give up.  Banana juice.  All right, thank you, Keith.  I really appreciate that.  Banana juice.  You're welcome, man.  Have a good one.  It's almost laughable to me.  Like, again, it's a divide and conquer because you guys are just a team, and that's the way  you do it.  That's how you try to do it.  But, like, to even have to explain that, and, you know, it's like, I hate to even say it  because it's Ops right here, and everybody knows we're friends, but it's more than reining  the show in.  It's like this ability that I don't have, Ant doesn't have, this ability to find Achilles 
[01:45:30]  in people and weakness, and look, it's an ugly thing sometimes, but on the air, there  is nothing better on radio than that ability to do that and to be able to be in the same  room with somebody and do that.  I can't do it, and you can't do it, and it's like, to have to explain that to anybody is  ludicrous.  Well, we all know what we do for the show.  That's why it gets, it does get annoying after a while when these people try to do  that whole divide and conquer thing. 
[01:46:00]  It wouldn't have been this successful for over 10 years, this program, the Opie and Anthony  show, now with our little pal Jimmy Norton.  Old Jimmy Norton.  It wouldn't have been if everybody didn't have a role and did it well.  That's just the way it is.  It wouldn't have worked.  It's no surprise, but I don't know.  He's done some other things, you know, after many, many years, he just turned his back  on Kenny, and that was very suspicious, those circumstances.  He just does this type of thing.  I've done more than kill you, Opie. 
[01:46:30]  I've hurt you, and I'm gonna go on hurting you.  Oh!  The rat that dies!  Just, uh, it's just...  He tasks me!  He tasks me!  I'll chase you around!  I wish I knew where he chased the fuck.  Just forget that one.  I'm not gonna lie to you.  I mean, it's easy for me to yell and scream and fight back, but the reality is it's a real 
[01:47:00]  bummer.  It's a real bummer.  Dice.  So...  Stop it, Dice.  So, it's worth doing that to sell a few tickets.  Irrelevant dreck.  Both of them.  Babbling about past glory days.  Go ahead.  And have fun over there.  And, you know, to keep it honest, there was a time when we first started on XM, Dice wanted  to come back on the show, but he wanted to talk to me first about my dad's death and  stuff, and I wasn't willing to talk to anyone about that. 
[01:47:30]  I only started to really, you know, move forward in the last, I don't know, three or four  months about that, you know?  So, if he's holding that over my head, Jesus Christ, I didn't talk to anyone.  I blew off pretty much everyone I know in my life for a year.  How about just coming in and doing a show and then, you know, worrying about hanging  out and getting, you know, personal relationships back together again?  You know, if you were to come on the show, that's fine.  Right.  But the guy is a mental patient.  But that's the only thing I can think of is because there was some talk that he needs 
[01:48:00]  to talk to me, and it never went down.  But I have a whole list at home of people I need to talk to still that I haven't talked  to in over a year.  And these people used to be very close in my life, but, you know, I just shut out everybody  after, you know, what we went through as a family.  And, you know, that's what you do.  You know, that's the only thing I can think of.  It's all you do.  That's the only thing I can think of is that I never, you know, called him.  But, you know, if he's going to hold that, then what can I tell you?  I don't know. 
[01:48:30]  Dead.  He's dead.  So there you go.  Instead of promoting, you know, the garden you're on Howard, trashing your old friends  to sell a few tickets to governors on Long Island, that's desperation.  And your kids must be really proud of you today.  Really proud.  Good one, Dice.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Uh, Opie's a dick.  That's great.  Let's say hi to Scott in Pennsylvania. 
[01:49:00]  Scott.  Hey, Opie, I just want to say I think you're a fucking asshole.  And I love you for it.  All right, thanks.  Bunch it out.  Bye, fella.  I need a little love right now.  A little boost.  I need a little, a little love.  Come on.  Do you need love?  I need a little love.  We love you.  I might need that, that hug from E-Rock after all.  Aww.  I love you.  Susan loves you.  Right.  E-Rock loves you.  Elmo loves you.  I'm the genuine oracle. 
[01:49:30]  Go on, hurt me.  Go on, hurt me if you have to.  I'm the genuine oracle.  My wife likes me.  Right.  That is one of the most pathetic scenes in movie history and makes me laugh so fucking hard every time.  Every time.  My customers love me.  But then you'll look around the room and you'll go, my wife likes me.  E-Rock is afraid of me.  The interns are afraid of me.  All right, we'll move on to other things. 
[01:50:00]  Dice, have your fun.  Other things.  What can I tell you?  What can I tell you?  Are you going to get the audio?  Yeah, we'll get the audio.  It'll be a painful, not painful lesson, but, you know.  What a dick.  I think that's what makes this radio show special.  We have no problem showing you guys the scars.  What a phony douchebag.  So if they're trashing me and killing me over there, we'll play all the audio and have fun with it.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Hey, uh.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[01:50:30]  I don't know.  Danny came in, looked at E-Rock.  E-Rock looked at him and walked in.  Well, I would have liked to have gotten the audio.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  What happened?  What happened?  Here comes the problem.  Here it comes.  Oh, boy.  But I was trying to hook up the old unit we have in the back because Eric likes to bring it home sometimes.  Uh-huh.  And I tried plugging it in.  I noticed that the power supply was wrong.  Unless Nokia makes it.  I don't know.  Oh, no.  I don't think someone's phone charger.  Oh, boy.  That's a real shame that we're not going to have audio of them trashing me. 
[01:51:00]  Well, maybe your roommate does or something because we don't have the, uh.  What a bummer.  That's such a bummer we don't have the audio of them trashing me.  I would have really liked to play that today.  Yeah.  Like 20,000 listeners aren't going to have it.  Yeah, I'm sure somebody will have it.  Yeah, but it kind of would have been nice to have immediately.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I don't understand what you're saying.  That cord is not, that's the cord you have and that's not the proper cord.  Right.  Yeah, this plugs into a Nokia cell phone to charge it.  Where's the cord?  Oh, probably in Eric's house.  No, I should have been there. 
[01:51:30]  I don't have a Nokia.  All right, why don't we move on, uh, the leprechaun story.  There's a part two.  No way.  There's a part two that came in.  Is part two as good as, uh, the first one?  Anyone?  That came from Steve.  It's a different audio, but it's good.  It's just as good?  I can't get enough of this, uh, leprechaun sighting thing in Mobile, Alabama.  Well, it's fascinating.  There seems to be a leprechaun on the loose in Mobile.  And the people there, the citizens, are, uh, commenting on it.  Yes, they are.  Or are they?  Because you can't understand a word they're saying. 
[01:52:00]  We got to play the original news story and then we got, uh, the brand new news story that  came in overnight, okay?  Uh-huh.  I think this video is up on opanthony.com, but, uh, they have, uh, a leprechaun that's  loose in a tree somewhere in Mobile, Alabama, and the locals are just losing their minds.  Listen to this.  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community, many of you bringing binoculars,  camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures.  To me, it look like a leprechaun to me.  I got to do a look up in a tree. 
[01:52:30]  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah?  Yeah!  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night.  If you shine a light in its direction, it suddenly disappears.  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun looks like.  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations  for the image.  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb.  Could be a crackhead that got home to the wrong stuff and it told him to get up in a tree 
[01:53:00]  and play a leprechaun.  We're gonna get down to the bottom of this.  You're still on there, guy.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid, man.  This guy, helping to direct traffic, says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun.  He's suited up from head to toe.  This was all smells right here.  This is a special leprechaun flute which has been passed down from thousands of years ago  from my great-great-grandfather who was Irish.  I just came to help out. 
[01:53:30]  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree.  I'm gonna run a backhoe and uproot that tree.  I wanna know where to go.  I want to go.  Get me to go.  I want to go.  That's one of the best news clips ever.  Ever.  So that was the original story.  We got a brand new story we're gonna play in a second here.  But Mike on Long Island might know what this is all about.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I figured out the leprechaun.  It's Greg and Peter Brady in the attic with a sheet, a flashlight, and a whistle. 
[01:54:00]  Watch it out.  Here goes the noise.  All right.  Well, uh...  Oh, wait.  Sorry, shit.  That was the UFO.  Yeah.  Let me do the ghost.  Ah!  Yeah.  That scares me.  All right.  Here's the new leprechaun story coming in overnight. 
[01:54:30]  The crowd started gathering around sunset.  Hey, sir, you sit right up there.  It's just right there.  It's just a face.  A face.  The eye.  The nose.  The mouth.  The frantic mouth.  What's up here?  It's just a face.  And right now, he's not happy.  I'm not kidding.  It's a frowning face.  A leprechaun.  It looked like...  Last night, it looked just like a little leprechaun.  It's still up there.  The people who see the leprechaun say you can see it better at night. 
[01:55:00]  And that's when the crowds really start coming out.  Now, step back, tell me, I'll see you.  If you just look right there, you'll see it.  Right there, you see it?  Do you see it?  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't see it.  I don't like you smiling right now.  I want to see it.  If it's here, I want to see it.  When is it going to pop up?  Well, actually, my brother came in from Atlanta last Sunday night, and we were standing out,  standing around, and he said, y'all not going to believe it, but it's like a man is up in  that tree.  And we were like, man, you're crazy. 
[01:55:30]  Pretty soon, there were more people creating traffic jams to see what could become known  as the leprechaun.  And he was smiling.  He was smiling, huh?  Uh-huh.  And then one moment, I thought he chipped his head.  What do you think about all the crowds that have come?  What has it been like the last couple of nights as far as crowds?  It looked like Mardi Gras.  We needed some floats.  Now, some people say they've seen the leprechaun, and some people say they haven't.  But one thing's for sure, nobody's found a pot of gold yet. 
[01:56:00]  Ugh.  So, does the leprechaun move around, or is it just something that looks like it could  be a face in a tree?  Yeah, it seems to me like one of those things, if you stand in the right spot and look, it  looks like a leprechaun.  Right.  Black people have lost their fucking minds.  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  I believe in leprechauns.  Day is never finished.  Master got me working.  Someday master set me free. 
[01:56:30]  They've lost their minds.  Oh, my goodness.  And the news is reporting this as a real news story.  What they're really doing, and this is why the news is so awful, is they're basically  saying, would you look at these jackasses?  Right.  And they don't have the moral courage to be honest about it.  Instead of going, look at these fucking dumb motherfuckers, which is, believe me, what  they're saying.  That's what the story is there.  It's not about a leprechaun. 
[01:57:00]  It's about how entertaining it is to listen to idiots talk about anything.  I just want to get a pot of gold, man.  I'm going to get me back, oh.  I'm going to dig for that gold.  That gold going to be mine.  Speaking of gold, we just got it from that clip.  That's exactly what they're thinking.  Yeah.  I think a leprechaun could be cracking.  No one talks about it.  No one talks about it.  You know, the anchors are probably like, well, that leprechaun, a pot of gold is supposed  to be at the end of the rainbow.  And we have a golden forecast for this weekend. 
[01:57:30]  Let's go to the weather.  Yet not one thing about those stupid apes.  Because you know that's what they're wanting to say.  But they don't even say it to each other.  It's not acknowledged, even to each other, that that is exactly what they're doing.  It's a racist broadcast.  It is nothing but goofing on uneducated people of the black race.  Yeah.  That's what the whole news thing.  But they don't talk about it.  They're not honest about it. 
[01:58:00]  It's the story about the leprechaun.  And they should be showcasing that.  If there's a group of human beings that are that fucking dumb, like these dumb motherfuckers  that see the Virgin Mary in a piece of soap, you should be showcased and then executed.  All right, let's go to Rashad in Houston.  Rashad, what's up?  I want to cry as a black man.  I really do.  You should.  I really do want to.  It's awful.  I've never hated black people in my entire life.  I want them all dead, including me. 
[01:58:30]  You've got to take one for the team.  No.  But do you see what the media does, though?  Like, you know what the media is doing with that and that they won't acknowledge it because  to acknowledge it is racist or insensitive or whatever they want to call it.  Absolutely.  It's a slap in the face.  I mean, it's bad on every single level.  I don't even want to go outside right now because they'll just be pointing and laughter in my  mind anyway because I'm just going to be associated with whatever the hell was just on TV.  I saw the clip last night.  I was in damn near tears when the guy showed the picture of the... 
[01:59:00]  Oh, the amateur drawing?  It was an acorn.  Yeah.  Acorn with a face.  Yeah.  Put it out, fellas.  All right, man.  Sorry about that, Rashad.  Hang in there.  Maybe Celine Dion could get a kayak and go...  Kayak?  Just let them touch the leprechaun.  That's all they want to do is touch it.  Then some woman come along.  I saw the leprechaun.  Then I saw this stick figure woman with a big camel toe. 
[01:59:30]  She had a vagina that the leprechaun then hid in.  Get out of here.  I'll see you later.  Seth Green came back just to say goodbye.  All right, there you go, Seth Green.  How do you know you're still here?  I know.  He was doing another interview.  He had so much fun, he said, on our show.  Cool.  And he just popped his head in and said goodbye for good.  Sorry, Anthony.  That's okay.  Frankie in New York.  Love you, Albie.  Thank you.  This whole thing makes me think of one sentence.  Yeah.  This is poor.  So black.  So poor.  And they're so black.  I just can't get enough of that clip. 
[02:00:00]  They're great.  Love to know.  Talking about finding the gold.  Here's one of my personal favorites, too.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out.  And I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  UPS.  Indeed.  Delivering him a package.  I got one, too.  We got to have a greatest hit CD.  Yeah.  We have to put this CD out.  She was shaking real bad.  They got shot. 
[02:00:30]  They got shot.  I said, who, who?  She said, boo got shot.  Boo got shot.  I said, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We just saw it.  My suicide called somebody up here.  She called my cousin, Punkin.  Just held up.  She called her.  And Punkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  And Chichi, she had left out.  And she went and got in her car.  She bad out.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again, when I heard the gunshot, and I seen  some boy had running the building over that way.  He ran that building, I seen that car that flew off, and then I seen a long gun, a big 
[02:01:00]  old gun in the car.  Okay.  Terrific.  And, of course, this one.  I believe this was, there was computers that they were selling.  Surplus school laptops that were like five years old for 50 bucks.  And, of course, the riot that ensued.  And here's one of the women talking about what she saw.  Look at my name.  I'm a earth.  I said, Randall taught me how to start kicking the people in the balls and everything.  I was like, you know, I was stuck so I couldn't breathe. 
[02:01:30]  I forgot about that one.  And the news person couldn't understand her.  They wouldn't let her say, I just started kicking people in the balls.  Right.  Which is what she said.  And it went out over the air.  Yeah.  It wasn't live.  It was a taped segment also.  They just didn't understand her.  Look at my name.  I'm a earth.  I said, Randall taught me how to start kicking the people in the balls and everything.  And I was like, you know, I was stuck so I couldn't breathe.  Kicking the people in the balls and everything.  I was pulling a cock. 
[02:02:00]  Well, this isn't a black clip, though, E-Rock.  But it's along the same lines.  A moron?  Yeah, a moron in the news.  Lucas, in my vagina, two times he bites me.  But his teeth are very small.  And they don't damage very much.  They just, they pinch.  They pinch.  Is that a real clip?  Yeah, it's a real news clip.  Jesus.  What a dog that was biting her in her vagina.  Vagina.  Vagina.  Doug wants to call you out on something. 
[02:02:30]  Doug out, Doug.  What's up?  Yes, sir.  Doug, we lose you?  Oh, hey.  What's up?  I'm sorry.  I was eating a croissant-wich from Burger King.  Ooh.  Those are lovely, but watch those love handles.  Exactly.  Anthony, I'm sorry.  I've got to call you out for once.  Oh, no.  Especially when it has to do with the Brady Bunch.  What did I do?  The ghost was Marsha.  And it said, I'm burning up.  Not a whistle.  Right.  No, there was a whistle in that episode. 
[02:03:00]  He's trying to make a joke.  No.  It wasn't a whistle.  I was just calling you out.  So, Brady Bunch, I take very fucking seriously.  There was, they put sheets over their heads, sir, and they used a ghostly whistle to try  to scare people from buying their house.  And the kids put sheets on their head, because remember at the end, there were two holes in  the sheets that, do you remember that episode, Doug?  Oh, now, see, now, that was first season. 
[02:03:30]  I'm talking, there was two seasons later when they did a ghost on a plastic sheet, but Marsha  was going, I'm burning up.  I remember that, too.  Yeah, I remember that, too.  There was definitely a ghost whistle.  But there was the ghost and the whistle.  There's only one way to solve this.  Yes.  Doug and Doug get in a car, suck each other's dicks, and then fucking drive off a cliff.  All right.  It's a faggoty show.  I'll pick you up when.  And the fact, I'm not going to be in the car.  I might just peek in through the window.  All right.  Doug, how's that website going for you? 
[02:04:00]  Which one's that?  Oh, fullblownaids.com is a great place to go, guys.  It's got a message board, oaexperience.com, which takes care of the show after the show  and all test activity.  And we got pal talk videos on Full Blown Aids, the website.  Are there links there to Wack Bag?  There are links to Wack Bag.  I love Wack Bag.  You know that, uh...  Wack Bag made me what I am today, which isn't much anyway.  I love the Wack Bag. 
[02:04:30]  You know, we're going on vacation starting tomorrow, but, uh, ah, the listeners don't  care.  The experience continues without us.  Of course it does.  Doug?  Eventually, we won't even be doing the show, but it'll still continue.  Doug?  All right.  Are there any pictures of me on fullblownaids.com?  No.  Why would there be?  As far as I've got Kim Norton, there is a, uh, I believe there are videos of you when  there are videos when you got your hair cut on there.  What about his ass?  Um, I don't know if we have any ass shot videos of Jimmy on there. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  We'll get one.  I'm sure we will.  All right.  If you move the camera right now, I'm sure somebody will vidcap it and get it in there.  All right.  Let's do that.  All right.  Kev, you might want to...  Kev, you want to move the camera closer, please, to my delicious ass?  Delicious.  Here we go.  What?  Can I not help the website out, please?  Oh, wait.  Well, E-Rock is lining it up.  You might want to...  You want to lower that, please?  I'm only 5'6".  No, you're fine.  Looks like he's going to take a shit in a coffee cup.  Oh, there he goes.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, God. 
[02:05:30]  Speaking of the Brady boys, there goes one of their asses right now.  That's right.  Hairless.  This looks like Bobby's season two.  Dude, is that a shadow on your ass or is that a spank mark?  Ah.  Or shit.  Shadow.  No, neither.  My ass is immaculate.  Any of you would be happy to eat my ass.  Trust me.  I think I just saw the leprechaun.  I see the leprechaun, your shiny light on it for Jimmy's ass crack, and the leprechaun  come out.  I see the Virgin Mary.  Just for your information, Jimmy, we are the only website on the entire internet, I believe, 
[02:06:00]  that showcases the Jackers of Power Talk also.  We have a lot of Jacker videos.  Great.  That's actually really funny.  You've got to get, like, comedy music or silly music behind it or whatever.  Benny Hill music and play them in fast motion.  There you go.  That is a fabulous idea.  Hey, Ben.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  Thank you, gentlemen.  There he goes.  Doug out, Doug.  He does a great job for us behind the scenes, especially radio.  All the O&A pests do a great job for us.  And by the way, we talked about Wolf Blitzer's thing so black. 
[02:06:30]  It's odd how he wasn't fired for that slip.  Yeah.  And yet this poor schlub radio guy.  Well, it was a little different.  Not really to me.  You don't think?  No.  I'll tell you why.  All right.  Obviously, coon is an offensive term.  But the guy, was he in Phoenix?  Do we have any information on this story?  Yeah, we got the audio.  Okay.  Oh, you got it?  No way.  Well, I don't know if we had the audio of what he did on his show, but we had the audio,  the news report of this guy.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  No?  It's a DJ from KTRS.  Dave Lenihan.  What's it?  A sports show?  Dave Lenihan, I believe.  Dave Lenihan from KTRS.  Well, here's the news story.  Bobby, thanks a lot for calling Big 550 KTRS.  I don't think that would be a good idea.  Oh, wow.  We have the actual audio.  No way.  Huh?  Get to a microphone.  I don't know where it went in.  Thank you.  No, that one doesn't work.  Do they bleep it out or something? 
[02:07:30]  No, this is the actual audio of Dave Lenihan on the air, and then the second clip is his  GM, sorry, the CEO of the company apologizing on air.  Oh, you're good, dude.  You are good.  Wow.  I try to beat you.  You certainly are.  And you succeed.  Here's the clip.  Oh, that uppity nigger went and hit me on the head with the shovel.  Oh, man.  Well, Lenny should have been fired.  I have no problem with his firing if he's going to be spouting off terms like that.  What's more embarrassing than the radio apology from the GM? 
[02:08:00]  The GM.  Nothing.  That's some audio we've got to find, if it's anywhere.  I think we have it.  No, I'm just saying GMs in general, you know, apologizing for what their jocks did.  Comes on every once in a while.  Bobby, thanks a lot for calling Big 550 KTRS.  I don't think that would be a good idea because we're going to need her to run against that  goofy broad Hillary.  We need her as the presidential candidate.  I think she's better fit for that role against the other female that will be running. 
[02:08:30]  She's pretty much said she doesn't want to run, though.  She's come out pretty much and said, you know, I don't want to be...  Well, we need to get somebody, and I think she's really cool.  I think she'd make a great president.  I mean, thanks a lot, Bobby.  I appreciate you giving us a call.  She's been Chancellor of Stanford.  I mean, she's got just the patent resume of somebody that's got some serious skill.  She loves football.  She's African-American, which would kind of be a big coon.  A big coon.  Oh, my God.  I am totally, totally, totally, totally, totally sorry for that.  Okay?  I didn't mean that.  That was just a slip of the tongue. 
[02:09:00]  She's definitely got all the attributes to be commissioner.  I'm really sorry about that.  All right?  Actually, let's just take a break.  This is Dave Lennon.  Big 550 KTRS.  What the fuck?  I guarantee I know what he was going for.  What was he trying to say?  A big coon.  A big coon.  A big coon.  What the fuck?  They fired this guy.  They fired him.  He got it mixed up saying, like, a boon to something.  You ever hear that?  A boon or a coo.  And sometimes you put the two words together, and he said coon instead of a coo or a boon.  It says right here, I was trying to say quite a coo, but it came out coon, he said. 
[02:09:30]  I called myself and apologized, which he did immediately.  Immediately he said he was sorry.  It wasn't anything I was meaning to say.  I never used that word.  They fired this guy over this?  They fucking, and the NAACP, these dumb motherfuckers.  The NAACP comes out and says it's a good thing he was fired immediately.  How about the fucking NAACP not recognized when a guy just had a slip, and he's not a racist, you dumb motherfuckers.  Oh, they recognize when it's a slip. 
[02:10:00]  When somebody like the mayor of New Orleans comes out and says he wants a chocolate city and stuff.  Get this guy on the phone.  Oh, that's no problem.  Get this fucking guy on the phone right now.  I guarantee he won't come on.  Let's see if he has balls to come on our show.  What?  Ben's trying.  I think that there's no one on the station yet.  What does this mean, Ben?  He's just twitching.  You can't do it.  You're trying?  That wasn't hand signals.  He was herking and jerking.  Dude, it's fucking, I want to bite.  What?  No one there yet.  No one there?  Oh, because what is this?  Out of Phoenix or something?  St. Louis.  Oh, St. Louis. 
[02:10:30]  What are they, two hours behind?  Oh, St. Louis.  One hour behind?  Oh, all right.  The guy should not have been fired for that.  Stop it.  Especially since he's like, I'm really, he stopped and said, I'm really sorry.  No one's, I'll even say, if he even meant to say they shouldn't be fired.  Maybe you don't like that, but come on, the guy's doing a talk show, right?  But, well, if you're on a sports talk show, like an ESPN type show, which I think is what  he's doing, I'm guessing, and you say coon and purpose, it's different than what we do,  so they're going to shit can you for that.  But if you make a mistake, and it's not, if he's a nigger, that's like, all right, that's 
[02:11:00]  a brutal, hateful, but then this groveling fuck of a GM or owner, whatever the fuck he  is, comes out and says, well, there's enough hate.  Is there dipshit?  Like what?  Little John, you want to talk about enough hate, you fucking groveling faggot?  This business is just unbelievable.  Commercial radio is filled with pussies.  What the fuck?  The guy didn't mean it.  The guy didn't mean it.  Listen again, I think we got it up to the point.  Thanks a lot, Bobby, I appreciate you giving us a call.  She's been Chancellor of Stanford, I mean, she's got just the patent resume of somebody 
[02:11:30]  that's got some serious skill.  She loves football, she's African American, which would kind of be a big coon.  A big coon.  Oh my God, I am totally, totally, totally, totally, totally sorry for that, okay?  I didn't mean that, that was just a slip of the tongue.  She's definitely got all the attributes to be commissioner.  I'm really sorry about that.  All right, thanks, let's just take a break.  This is Dave Lennan, Big 550 KTRS.  See, not only did he get...  Not only did he say sorry immediately, he was so flustered he went to a break, and that  was an uncomfortable laugh at the end. 
[02:12:00]  He handled it well, he did what he could.  I think that he should have, when he said a big coup, he should have said what he meant  was a big coup.  I mean, I think he just got flustered, but then to take a break to me, and this is what  bothers me.  There were complaints to the station after, of course.  Did a bunch of fucking black people hear it and not like it?  Or was it a bunch of white people who objected to somebody vocalizing what they probably  said in their own homes 500 times?  Yeah.  Why would you call in and complain when the guy apologized?  He obviously didn't mean it, you fucking double-standard motherfuckers. 
[02:12:30]  Phoniness.  And he was obviously trying to say another word.  Of course he was.  No one...  Holy crap.  He was praised...  It was about Condi Rice.  I know.  And he was praising her.  She obviously has this...  Because she's apparently a big football fan or whatever, where there was rumors of her  running the NFL, and he was saying that she's got the skills, and for whatever reason he  mentioned she's African-American.  That shows you, by the way, that he's a PC worm anyway, who probably deserved to get  fired.  Fuck him.  African-American.  Is she shit dick?  She's black.  Say it.  Don't be afraid of the word.  It's not racist.  It's unbelievable.  And that's one of the problems with radio in general. 
[02:13:00]  There's a lot of creative people that want to get into this business because it's shit.  It's shit.  It's shit.  And you have no security because of one slip of the tongue, and like it says in this article,  we'll get into it in a second, this was the guy's dream job.  It was his dream job.  One slip of the tongue, and you're out.  Nightmare job.  And then regular radio especially, or commercial radio, whatever the fuck you want to call  it, they wonder why they don't have talent.  But no one wants to do it.  They'd rather go into something else with their creativity.  And this is different, by the way, than that weather forecaster who called Martin Luther 
[02:13:30]  King Day, Martin Luther Coon Day.  I mean, I know that that's a mistake, too.  Yeah, it was.  But do we have that?  We have that audio somewhere.  To me, that's a much bigger one for some reason.  When you're saying Martin Luther Coon.  Yeah, bigger.  All right.  Sorry.  It was his eighth day on the job?  Yeah.  Ken in St. Louis, what's up?  Hey, man.  I was watching the news this morning, and they said this is this guy's eighth day on the job.  So how is the news spinning it, bro? 
[02:14:00]  How are they spinning it?  What's that?  How are they spinning?  Do they even play the word coon, or do they beep it?  No, they beep it.  They suck.  Oh, I fucking hate white America.  Holy shit.  Why don't you move to Canada then, Jimmy Norton?  What a bunch of fucking, groveling, dishonest people.  Yep.  You are dishonest.  Yep.  You guys suck.  Don't yell at Ken. 
[02:14:30]  Hey, here's the Martin Luther.  He's just calling in, Jimmy.  Here's the Martin Luther Coon Day thing that the weather guy slipped up on.  The next couple of days, temperature is going to stay well above normal after a couple of days well below normal.  Here's a look at your extended forecast for tomorrow.  Sunshine, 60 degrees, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  We're going to see temperatures in the low 60s and mostly sunny skies.  Look at that as we head toward Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  And boom goes the dynamite. 
[02:15:00]  And we all knew that that was, he was jumping from King to Jr.  Yeah.  I mean, that's just, to me, it's a little bit more serious than Martin Luther King to call Martin Luther, you know, cool.  But his intention was not to say that.  But then again, here's the other side of the argument.  They'll say, well, we understand his intention wasn't, but if he would have said, fuck.  And I know that's an FCC violation, but that's what their argument will be.  But, well, you know, he slipped.  We understand that.  But, you know, every job, even though it's a mistake, we're not putting him in jail.  All right, once again, let's play it.  And then you've got to hear the GM.  It's unbelievable. 
[02:15:30]  Hold on a minute.  I just want to get right to the thing.  All right.  It's really cool.  I think she'd make a great president.  I mean, thanks a lot, Bobby.  I appreciate you giving us a call.  She's been Chancellor of Stanford.  I mean, she's got just the patent resume of somebody that's got some serious skill.  She loves football.  She's African-American, which would kind of be a big coon.  A big coon.  Oh, my God.  I am totally, totally, totally, totally, totally sorry for that.  Okay?  I didn't mean that.  That was just a slip of the tongue.  She's definitely got all the attributes to be commissioner.  I'm really sorry about that. 
[02:16:00]  All right?  Actually, let's just take a break.  This is Dave Lennon.  Big 550 KTRS.  He was so flustered, you could tell.  And he's all got the radio sports voice going real good.  Look, I'm really sorry.  I'm really fucking sorry.  Holy shit.  Wow, I screwed up really bad.  But, you know, I'd be great for this other.  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  I am so sorry.  That is the country we live in.  There's no room for an honest mistake.  No.  We are such racially sensitive, dishonest.  We're a nation of dishonest motherfuckers. 
[02:16:30]  Walking on eggshells.  We are a nation of fucking liars.  Mm-hmm.  Dishonest.  Nobody will acknowledge, hey, it was an accident.  Let it go.  Let it go.  And black people, why?  Why would the fucking NAACP come out and praise that firing when you know the difference?  And the white guy, boss, has to fire him because he's afraid if he doesn't fire him, he's in cahoots.  Now he's a cocksucker, too.  Fuck him.  And then he's racist.  All right.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  This is what's unbelievable, too. 
[02:17:00]  According to the story, within 20 minutes, within 20 minutes of what that guy said on the air, station CEO Tim Dorsey apologized on the air to listeners and announced that Lenahan, who had been with the station for less than two weeks, had been let go.  20 minutes.  They didn't even sit down in an office and go, oh, my God, this is really bad.  What can we do?  We have people banging a church, and it took them a week to fire us.  This guy gets a slip.  And this is the phoniness of the fucking black community and the fucking NAACP.  When Jerry Brown, this is a story I'd want to get to a while ago. 
[02:17:30]  I forget what the story was, but he said, nigger something.  I forget what it was in context of, but he was trying to be the white guy who can get away with it.  He wasn't shitting on people.  And so Sharpton, they questioned Sharpton, and he goes, no, Jerry Brown's not a racist.  And he came out and defended Jerry Brown.  That's how fucking phony.  Was it Brown or Nader?  What's that?  Was it Brown or Nader?  It was, oh, you know what?  Maybe you're right.  I think it was Ralph Nader.  If it was Nader, I apologize.  It was some fucking radical left-wing motherfucker.  Yeah, it was somebody who they wouldn't touch. 
[02:18:00]  No one on the right.  Yeah, they wouldn't touch him because he's so left-wing.  If it's Nader, I apologize.  It's one of those two.  But Sharpton came out and defended him.  It's like, you know that this guy's intention was not to be hateful, you dummies.  You know it.  Well, Tim Dorsey, the CEO, goes on.  I haven't let go.  I don't know what was in Mr. Lenehan's mind, Dorsey said in an interview.  I know what I heard.  I know it was reprehensible.  Was it?  Well, here's what, so like literally like 20 minutes later, half hour later, they start  rolling this.  Hamna, hamna, hamna. 
[02:18:30]  No, not in Sednaker.  Hamna, hamna, hamna, hamna.  They roll this apology.  Stammering GM.  On the station.  Today is not a very good day.  And today I'm actually sorry to have to talk to your audience.  At 945 this morning, one of our people on the air, Dave Lenehan, made an unfortunate,  most unfortunate racial slur toward our Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice.  And for that remark, KTRS sincerely apologizing, apologizes to all, to certainly Mr. Rice, but  also to all of our listeners and to anyone who has any sort of feeling and sentiment at 
[02:19:00]  all.  There were excuses made for it, that it was a slip of the tongue.  There is no excuse for what was said.  As a result of that, Dave Lenehan has been let go.  He will not be back with KTRS.  And I want all of our listeners to know, and I want everybody to know, that what he  had said certainly doesn't reflect on the feelings of anybody at this radio station.  It's completely the opposite.  There is no place for anything like that anywhere in this world.  There is enough hate.  And we certainly are not going to fan those flames.  So again, I apologize to all of our listeners. 
[02:19:30]  It wasn't even a flame.  That is not what we're about.  We're about completely the opposite.  Get this fucking guy on the phone.  I hope this guy.  Get this guy on the fucking phone.  Dude, the rage I feel right now.  Let's get, what's his name first of all?  Can we get his name and give out his name at least?  What, Tom Dorsey?  Tommy Dorsey?  Tim Dorsey, CEO of the station.  Tim Dorsey, CEO of the station.  What is his station?  KTRS.  KTRS in what?  St. Louis.  St. Louis, Missouri. 
[02:20:00]  What a fucking loser.  You groveling faggot.  You gotta stick up for your people.  Especially when you know he is meaning.  There were excuses like a slip of the tongue, but there is no excuse.  No, there is.  That's the excuse.  Why is there no excuse?  Exactly.  The guy fucked up.  If he had said something about, like, you know, that guy's a dumb spook, and then they  called him out and then later said, hey, I slip.  Oh my God, no.  That's different.  Yeah, that's a racist remark.  That's fine.  Fire him.  But when you are saying coup, and you tack on an N at the end, because maybe you're confused 
[02:20:30]  over which word you wanted to use, and you're rattling off a speech as quickly as he was,  it's gonna happen.  And he actually said African American first.  Yeah.  Right.  He was being over-careful to begin with.  And he didn't even wait.  He didn't, I was gonna try to say it less than a second.  He didn't, no time.  He went right into the apology mode.  Yep.  He had immediately apologized.  And the NAACP applauded the swift action. 
[02:21:00]  And they accepted his apology.  Did they?  Did they?  The GMs or his?  Let's find out.  They accepted his apology.  How fucking wonderful of them.  I'd love to get them on the phone, too.  That fucking annoying organization.  Gunny.  Gunny Hartman from Wackbag.  Good morning, boo-boo boys, and good morning, my little, uh, um.  Get to your point when you can't fucking come up with a funny name for Jimmy.  You know what's killing me about this?  What's killing me about this is that Condoleezza Rice hasn't said a thing yet, but the head  of the NAACP is the one who accepted the apology, huh? 
[02:21:30]  Well, they represent all black people unless they do something wrong.  Then they don't.  He's the one who accepted the apology.  What's going on?  Did he really?  Now, is he also gonna make an apology, uh, to the fucking family of the bouncer that was  raped and murdered by Daryl Littlejohn?  Is he gonna make the apology?  If he can accept the apology on behalf of all black people, why doesn't he fucking make  an apology on behalf when somebody does something wrong?  Yeah.  Come on, stop it.  You can't have it both ways.  Punch it out.  All right, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Chris in Charlotte.  You can't have it both ways.  Hey, dude.  Hey.  Y'all are awesome. 
[02:22:00]  Uh, this is really pissing me off, too, and you watch within a couple of days or a week,  there's gonna be a lawsuit by the NAACP, the ECLU, and the part that pisses me off, they  don't even, uh, acknowledge Condoleezza Rice, Clarence Thomas, people like that, they call  them Uncle Tom's.  Yeah, I know.  Isn't it hilarious to the NAACP?  You know, because they're black people that made it, and, you know, but now, all of a  sudden, it's, you know, they call him a nigger or something like that.  I mean, that's ridiculous.  Nigger's different, dude. 
[02:22:30]  If he had said that, no matter how fast you apologize, that's a completely...  You ain't getting off of that one.  But that sounds like nothing else that you're gonna be saying.  There's nothing you could mean but that, but when you know, that would be quite a...  That would be a big coon.  That would be a big coo.  You know what he was saying.  Radio is filled with a bunch of cowards.  Cowards.  Fucking cowards.  And this guy, Tim Dorsey, the CEO, is one of the biggest...  Groveling.  ...that I've seen in recent years.  Groveling.  A fucking coward.  Did you hear his fake disgust as he's saying it?  Oh, we had a bad day. 
[02:23:00]  Did you have a bad day, Tim?  It's a bad day today.  Do you have a website for that, Merrick?  This morning at exactly 9.  9.45.  Uh, uh, what happened?  Jesus Christ.  You have a picture of Tim?  There's fear in commercial radio.  There's cowards in commercial radio.  And then, you know, you can't find real talent for your radio stations.  They deserve it.  Commercial radio deserves the ass-fucking they're getting by satellite. 
[02:23:30]  You can hear the excitement in this guy's voice.  He had a new gig.  He was in St. Louis.  Oh, so happy.  He was really loving life, this David Linehan.  And, uh, you know, people think we don't support other radio guys.  Well, here you go.  This is the shit we do support.  Uh, the guy, uh, David, reached at home.  Linehan said he was still trying to figure out what happened and was drafting a letter of apology to Rice.  I was trying to say quite a coup, but it came out coon, he said.  Of course it did.  I caught myself and apologized.  It wasn't anything I was meaning to say.  I never used that word. 
[02:24:00]  I think she's a fantastic woman.  I was even talking about if she ran for president.  I'd work on her campaign.  Uh, he said the biggest fear is that his choice of words tarnished the image of St. Louis and the baseball team, which is a part owner of the station.  Uh, it was a dream job, he said.  Ratings were going well.  It kind of stinks.  It was his dream job.  Yeah, so, you know, stop with the St. Louis shit.  You fucked up.  It was a dumb thing and they never should have fired you.  Fucking oversensitive. 
[02:24:30]  We are really living in a dishonest country.  America is not honest.  No.  We're not honest.  So dishonest.  Some radio station, well, they didn't, you know, it ain't gonna happen.  I was gonna make a plea like a radio station out there in St. Louis, just hire this fucking guy.  We had a bad day.  Did you have a bad day?  We had a bad day.  We had a bad day.  At exactly 9.48, Colonel Blake's plane spun into the Sea of Japan.  There were no survivors.  This is a fucking asshole.  There were no survivors. 
[02:25:00]  And unfortunately, no spooks on the flight either.  Oh, God.  Hit.  Oh, and Jimmy too now, because Jimmy's been around a while.  Does that just remind you of so much shit in this business?  We've been there, seen it a million times.  And I wouldn't have nearly as much of a problem with it.  It's still despicable.  But if they held, and I say they, I mean fucking superiority complex white people.  And yeah, I'm gonna keep fucking saying that.  If you held black people to the same level of accountability, it would still annoy me, but not as much. 
[02:25:30]  But you don't.  You treat people like they're children.  You treat minorities like they're children.  And white people like, well, we should know better.  Where is, and I would love to know.  Now this guy who murdered this girl, he put a sock in her mouth and tortured her.  That's not a reflection on blacks.  The guy's an animal.  He should be squashed like a bug if he did that.  But where is the, you understand what I'm saying?  Like, why is that not being connected racially?  Where, let me tell you something.  If there was a white guy on the cover of the Post today who had put a sock and mummified a fucking black girl and murdered her. 
[02:26:00]  It would be a race crime.  Not only would the awful crime be talked about, but the racial implications.  This woman was, it was because she was black.  There would be all the people out there.  Reverend Al, NAACP.  They'd all be saying how he did that to her because she was black.  The mummification, the sock in the mouth, the hatred, that whole thing.  But he's a black guy.  She was a white girl.  And that's why it's fine.  It's just another crime.  It's just what they do.  Underneath it, that's the way that superiority complex works. 
[02:26:30]  They look at a guy like this, and deep down they think, well, that's just what they do.  That's just what they do.  And we as white people, we're a little better, so we have to accept it as what they do.  And that's how the left thinks.  Want to hear the other side of this, too?  Sure.  Chris in Bayside, we've got a station here in New York called Hot 97.  Chris?  Yeah.  I've heard this shit on Hot 97, by the way.  I know how some of these people on Hot 97 get to talk to make racial slurs about white people.  Nobody ever says anything.  And then when something stupid like this comes up, they make a big fucking deal out of it. 
[02:27:00]  Well, I mean, look.  I mean, I remember when they were doing the whole thing about New Orleans.  They made a whole bunch of racial white comments.  And then she made another comment when the tsunamis hit.  They got her kicked off the air for a couple days.  And then they just let her back on like nothing happened.  Well, they did.  I mean, the tsunami thing did cost a lot of people.  There was a huge fallout.  Although they, you know, I think it was a safe fall.  I think 97 was reprehensible in the way they handled that, too.  There was a station, I guess it's where Air America is now, LIB.  But it used to be just a militant black station. 
[02:27:30]  I used to listen to it every day when I was on the job working.  And it was so funny to listen to it.  I would get so riled up I'd want to kick the radio off the roof.  It was nothing but black people just talking how the white people are devils and we got to stick with our own.  And it's a vast conspiracy and just hatred pouring out of the hosts, the callers, the sponsors, everything.  Just sheer hatred of white people. 
[02:28:00]  And they were fine.  And they should be fine, though.  You should be allowed to do that.  As much as I think it stinks, you should be allowed to do that.  As long as you're not violating FCC rules, go ahead.  Let's go to Flood in Queens.  Flood?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  Morning.  Hi.  Yo, I was just commenting on what Jimmy was saying about this whole idea of white people having to be fraternalistic towards blacks.  And this attitude that, oh, well, they don't know, brother, so it's okay.  Let them get along with it. 
[02:28:30]  And this and that and a third.  And the whole thing about the NAACP is that since they started, their whole thing was the idea of lifting people of color and things like that.  But they haven't done shit in, like, God knows, 60 fucking years.  You know what I'm saying?  So now they got to sit around and justify their existence by pointing out every little insensitive thing white people might say or do.  Are you black?  Yes.  Now, can you—I'm sure you've dealt with racism before.  I mean, it happens.  Are you, as a black guy, able to, at least most times, see the difference between when somebody is being truly hateful or truly racist or somebody who is being honestly not racist and made a mistake? 
[02:29:00]  Absolutely.  Like, when you played the clip of the DJ, I didn't know what the fuck you guys were talking about.  I said, what'd you say?  When you started apologizing, I didn't even hear what he said.  Yeah, a lot of people say you can barely hear the slip-up.  So, all right.  Thanks, man.  I didn't hear the slip-up.  I just heard him say something, and he just started apologizing.  I had no idea what he was talking about.  Yeah, well, he had that rapid-fire delivery going on, and sometimes when you're talking that fast, shit happens. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks, Flood.  All right, later.  In a way, that whole left-we-have-to-coddle-them thing, they're-not-responsible-for-what-they-do thing is so much more dangerous than the blatant right-side racist, who at least you know what he is.  Right there, he's saying he doesn't like black people, he's using racial slurs, whatever.  At least you can identify that guy as what he is.  The other side is so camouflaged in this do-gooder suit that you can't tell they're just as bad. 
[02:30:00]  Malcolm X said that in his biography, that he-  I told him that.  No, he actually did footnote you.  He said that he had more respect, or whatever he said, for the southern racists than the northern racists, because he hides the way he really is.  And again, look, this is not even about liberal conservatives, I'm sure the guy is a station owner, he might not be a bleeding heart, he's a groveling businessman.  Yeah.  I mean, this goes across even left and right, I mean, there's plenty of-  Everyone's a politically correct fucking racial coward, and I don't mean white power, but when you know a guy made an honest mistake, just fucking have some moral courage and say you made an honest mistake. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Man, Jimmy's right up, you're losing your voice and everything.  Dude, that just drives me nuts.  Hey, can we give out this guy's email address legally, or what?  What's the deal with that?  The CEO.  I don't know.  Well, there is a website out there.  Well, maybe-  I hope that Wackbag or Full Blown Aids-  Well, there's a website out there.  Or opianathony.net or cringehumor.com, I hope none of them get the actual audio.  I mean, I'm sorry, the actual email address and post it, because then people would probably fucking flood this guy's. 
[02:31:00]  There's a website out there, let's just put it that way, it's KTRS, and the CEO's name was what?  What was it?  Because it was in the news.  Tim something?  Tim, uh-  Tim Dorsey?  Tim Dorsey.  Yeah.  All right, why don't we say hi to the one, the only, Elo.  Elo.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Eric.  There he is.  Elo, how is our relationship going to end?  Because in radio, all relationships end.  Is it with you making an apology on these very airwaves? 
[02:31:30]  Guys, is it going to be a phone call?  Guys, I love you, but how many times have we heard this one?  Guys, I love you, but I had to do it.  I had to do it.  Did you have to make a couple of those apologies?  Yes, I have actually had to make a few of those.  They're very awkward and painful.  Do you remember one, maybe?  Wing it.  What's that?  Do you remember any of them?  Can you wing one?  I remember in Oklahoma City, my morning guy at the time, and we were in a little car lot,  and basically offended the Chevrolet dealership, talking about gas mileage or some crazy deal. 
[02:32:00]  And I went on the air and had to suspend the guy for saying disparaging things about an advertiser.  I would like to, what did you use, your radio voice?  Oh, yeah.  The management of this radio station.  It's always some awful voice, too.  You know what?  And they all start off the same way, with your name, your title, and I'm issuing a formal apology.  It all starts this way.  This is how it starts off.  Hi, this is Eric Logan, program director of XXX in Oklahoma City. 
[02:32:30]  I would like to officially apologize on the comments on behalf of insert talent name here.  I mean, there's a website that you can download the script.  www.grovel.com.  We might need the expert on the air today.  Lee Abrams knows all this crap.  Oh, boy.  He's the keeper of all this crap in that head of his, when he's not smoking pot and falling asleep as he flies his plane.  He doesn't fall asleep.  Yes, he does.  He's driving, he's flying around with Bob Dylan right now.  He's a responsible pilot.  Oh, sure he is. 
[02:33:00]  Eric, you've been, I mean, you're a boss now, but I mean, you've been a boss on that level, like, kind of a, like, what, what is the station supposed to do when that kind of stuff happens?  Well, I mean, they're just covering their, they're just covering their ass is what they're doing.  I mean, they're just taking, they're taking it so they get out.  They want to diffuse the situation as fast as they can, so they want to remove the problem so they can say, see, we did something and try to move on.  Well, can I ask you this, because this comes up from time to time, what would really happen, and this is a pretty tame one, what would really happen if you kept this guy in the air?  So many people would be checking him out. 
[02:33:30]  The ratings would be going through the roof.  Like, what, like, corporate America gets so scared, and like you just said, they love to diffuse the shit as soon as possible and move on with business.  But what if they didn't?  What, like, play it out.  What happens?  Do you get the, hold on, hold on, let me just finish.  Do you get the protesters outside the station for a day or two, or are they still out there six months from now?  Or do they finally give up and go, all right, they ain't gonna do, they're not doing anything?  No, that's the bottom line.  The bottom line is, is that they just want to get away from it as fast as they can, and with the media and the internet and word can spread so fast, it blows up so much faster today than it used to even five years ago. 
[02:34:00]  But I will tell you, there was a company that I worked for back in the 90s called Alliance, and it was Young Country, and there was my mentor, a guy named Eric Torcaso, and he constantly would tell us, you know, to go, not do these sort of things, but when these sort of things happen, you know, stand by your talent.  He's the one who really taught me to stand by your talent, defend your talent, make sure that you're on the right first, and, you know, push the envelope, because if everybody stays comfortable and nobody causes anything to be thought of, then you're not doing your job. 
[02:34:30]  And that's just a dying breed of radio that's out there.  What should happen to this guy then?  Do you know, Elo, we will be playing that clip of you someday after we're fired.  Hey, no kidding.  And here's me and I'll be talking.  Oh, here's the guy.  Listen to this tape of him saying how he stands behind his talent.  You have a quote for me already.  Let's play the tape again, Opie.  Let's listen to him say he'll stand behind the talent, right behind us as he kicks us out the door. 
[02:35:00]  Here's another guy that let us down in our careers.  I remember three months ago when I said this on the air when we had the assault on, when you had the attack on the media thing.  Right.  I remember saying that, and Opie's quote to me was, uh-oh, we're dead.  I've heard that before.  I did say that because he was giving me that crap.  The famous, we'll get through this, will we?  We'll get through this, guys.  Will we?  What do you think should have happened?  Like, from a business point of view, what should they have done with this guy?  What they should have done? 
[02:35:30]  Well, what I would have done was let him stay on the air and had him go on the air the next morning and make a formal apology.  Because he could tell he was sincere when he listened to it.  Sure.  And then just move on.  Ride it out.  Ride it out.  Yep.  I want to see one radio station write out one of these controversies.  The ratings would be through the roof and the advertisers would come around.  I know they never write it out.  Yeah, but you know what, though?  Look at us.  We had a couple have sex in St. Pat's.  Shh.  And there's rumors that we might be back on, you know, that's the thing. 
[02:36:00]  The thing.  All is forgiven.  See?  All is forgiven.  See what happens?  You know when all is forgiven?  Huh?  Cha-ching.  That's what comes.  Money surpasses even, like, the racism, everything else.  It all boils down to cash.  Yeah, how much can we make for that?  Well, I mean, you look at Cowhead down in Tampa.  I mean, he got fired for saying something, you know, relatively innocuous in an interview down there.  He got fired by a radio station down there.  I mean.  Cowhead's a friend of the show, and, yeah, maybe people don't know he got fired from his latest gig in Tampa. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Yep.  So, I mean.  I thought it was something he did on the air, no?  No, it wasn't.  Yeah, it was an interview.  I can't remember the bit.  An interview?  He played it for me.  It was so benign.  It was amazing.  And, of course, benign to me is because I work with you guys, so I guess my filter level skewed.  All right.  What do we got going on today there, Elo?  Well, let's see.  We have to confirm the Kettle One rumor from yesterday.  All right.  So, if you want to go ahead and just tell them, listen, first of all, this is because of what you guys did and the pests, and God love the pests, and I want to thank all the pests who email me on an hourly basis. 
[02:37:00]  And I appreciate all the, I guess, is it called flaming responses you get on the chat boards?  Is that what it's called?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got quite a few of those from last night.  But, yes, the rumors are true that Liquid Metal is going to come back to XM this spring.  So, Channel 42 will return on the air, and that is due, I will say, 99% part of everything that you guys have been allowing me to do and the pests have done. 
[02:37:30]  But this is the first time we're officially confirming that the channel is coming back.  Hey, Eric, what is that, what's the difference between, like, Liquid Metal and, um, I don't think I had XM when it was first, uh, between that and the Boneyard?  Liquid Metal, to me, is, uh, well, without offending the people, I can't understand a word it says.  Okay.  It is just, I mean, that's why I have Ward and I have Manny here.  They, it's, it's completely, Boneyard is stadium 80s hairband rock. 
[02:38:00]  That's what, that's what that is.  Liquid Metal is, like, New Metal.  It is much more aggressive.  Okay.  Like Slayer and Venom and that type of stuff.  All right, cool.  That sounds good to me.  Yeah.  Eloy doesn't know.  What's it replacing, or is it nothing?  No, it's, uh, it's just coming back, it's coming back.  We actually put it on the web and kept it alive, and, and, uh, that's what we do sometimes.  We put certain channels over on XM Radio Online and put them on DirecTV and AOL and fine-tune the format, make it more, uh, mass appeal, and then bring it back to the, bring it back to Satellite. 
[02:38:30]  Hopefully, uh, hopefully it replaces Music Lab.  Who the hell wants to know what's going on in the lab?  I'll wait for the, uh, the final, the final product.  I gotta say, too, I love...  It's out of the lab.  Exactly.  I'm sure, uh, before they discover, give me a good product, Anthony.  Uh, aluminum foil.  Peanut butter.  They, they're in the lab working on all sorts of peanut butter recipes, but who wanted to really taste those recipes?  Right.  You don't want them in the lab? 
[02:39:00]  You're not making sandwiches in the lab?  You don't want to know what's going on in the lab?  No labs.  Just give me the final product.  So, wait, I have a question for you, too.  Um, I, I, I actually like the Air Musique, or whatever it's called, the Canadian Montreal station, they all sing in French.  Yeah.  That makes me very happy.  Prera Chaka.  I love that song.  Why would you be listening to that station, Jimmy?  Maybe because I'm a varied human being.  Maybe because I work with a bunch of narrow-minded curmudgeons, and I happen to be in...  What do you have against Sir La Root?  What's that, sweetie?  What do you have against Sir La Root? 
[02:39:30]  I don't know what that means.  That's two channels away from Air Musique.  Ah.  Mr. Elo, if I will.  Anthony and I know Jimmy pretty well.  The only reason he would be listening to the station is because he's trying to get some ass.  No, I know you...  Somehow.  Come on, Jimmy.  I was slipping around.  How are you parlaying that into ass?  I was flipping around.  All of a sudden, you were into deep tracks, and we found out it was because you wanted  to bang a hippie chick.  And now you're listening to...  I'm into liquid metal because I want a fat girl. 
[02:40:00]  He's going to go somewhere, NYU, and listen to Ex-Im Classical.  You know, there was a time he was listening to the Broadway channel, and it was because  he wanted a fag hag.  Here's the beauty of liquid metal coming back, is that now there are two, like, really heavy  stations.  And then Boneyard is pretty heavy, man.  Oh, you know I got a fucking...  Two?  What about Squiz?  Squiz gets up there.  Oh, do they?  I didn't even know.  Squiz gets up there.  I love...  We had our problems with Cool Guy, but I gotta be honest.  I listened to his show the other night.  It was fucking fantastic.  Yeah? 
[02:40:30]  On the Boneyard.  I love Cool Guy.  Played some Sabbath.  Not only did he play Sabbath, but the guy called and requested Sabbath.  It goes, Paranoid, Iron Man, and Cool Guy's...  All right, look, man.  You can hear those on the regular station.  But he didn't go so deep.  He goes, how about this?  Or how about...  He played Dirty Women, which is...  That's not that deep at all.  No, it's deep.  I don't know that one.  But it's not...  There's a lot deeper you can go.  And it's like...  They still play that in concert.  Like, that's like an obscure one that they'll still do.  How do you know?  That has mass appeal.  So I love Cool Guy's show. 
[02:41:00]  Then he followed up with Live Wire.  So now that there's two stations, it's probably a little easier for a boy and a member of Black Sabbath to do like a one or two hour radio special.  That's why I love the 70s, because I could hear Olivia Newton-John's physical and then go right into ABBA, Mama, or Dancing Queen.  Cool.  You know?  And it's fantastic.  You're preaching to the choir.  Same thing.  Same thing.  Hey, you got Ziggy on the line.  And he just wants to personally thank you from MyRadioStore.com.  Ziggy. 
[02:41:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  You're on.  Hi, Ziggy.  You're on with Elo.  Yes.  I was just waiting for this announcement for the longest time.  And, you know, I'm sure Elo knows how much I care and wanted this back.  And this means the world to me.  Well, I'll tell you something about this as well.  Ziggy was actually the first person I called when the decision was made to take it down.  And I told him, I said, I appreciate you being supportive.  And he didn't necessarily agree with it, but understood it.  And the fans on XM411 and all the websites kept talking about bringing it back. 
[02:42:00]  And, you know, it just goes to show that I think that the fans of XM, the fans of this show, the fans of Liquid Metal certainly are passionate and deserve to have the channel back.  So we're really happy to bring it back.  And I think we've got a few twists and turns and some enhancements, and it's going to be an exciting new Liquid Metal.  You guys, I respect the fact that you guys listen to the fans.  I mean, you're like, all right, well, this is, you know, they want it back.  We'll give it back to them.  That's great, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, the grassroots of XM, like back in, you know, three, four years ago when it first started, you know, I was like right there. 
[02:42:30]  It was great because you could, like, offer all this input and stuff, and it's just good to know that it's still alive.  And, you know, although, you know, the decision I didn't agree with over a year ago, but the fact that you guys are bringing it back is just so fucking awesome, you know.  All right.  Well, one of the things when you get big like this, we take our knocks, and, you know, I've been criticized in a lot of different places about making it, you know, too corporate or whatever it is.  But we really have never gotten away from the fans.  Oh, I ring.  Come on now.  It's just at the PR side. 
[02:43:00]  You're terrible.  I'm a ring.  I disagree.  I think it's very exciting.  I know you are.  I don't know why.  I stopped him in his tracks.  I know.  You really did.  That was a good one.  Go get fucked up.  All right.  Later, boys.  Bye, Ziggy.  Bye, Ziggy.  See you later.  That was followed by a throat clear.  Well, I'm just saying.  What else?  You guys ready for the second one for the arched, what your guy Kingston's got for you? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  This is the first project we're doing with an old enemy.  With an old enemy who's done a great job.  Now, you guys know more about this.  Now, Jimmy, do you know who Jack White is, right?  Are they White Stripes?  White Stripes.  I like the boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Jimmy knows some.  I like that song.  All right.  So, you know, are you hip to the Rockin' Tours, the new band?  Yeah, sure.  It's his new band.  What does Rockin' Tours or Rockin' Tours mean?  Rockin' Tours?  I have no idea. 
[02:44:00]  Rockin' Tours.  Like, how about I come up with a name of your band that's easier to pronounce?  Because it's just White Stripes.  It's just him and it's, you know, a chick on the drums.  Actually, this is really cool because I am.  And this is full band.  I am a huge White Stripes fan and Jack White has added a guitar player and his sister is going to still drum.  So basically.  Yeah, Jack Lawrence is there, Patrick Heeler.  Right, right.  And what, so is this a side project or what?  No, it's a whole album.  Yeah, it's a whole album.  One album, it's called, it's going to be called Broken Boy Soldiers.  And it comes out on May 16th. 
[02:44:30]  And what you guys have got is an exclusive session for you and a 20 or so number, we've got to figure out the number, but it's, you know, teens 20, of O&A fans to actually go down to the Hit Factory at a date, which we won't disclose yet because we don't want to have it.  But sit in there and watch them perform.  We're going to record the show.  You guys get to interview Jack White and Brendan Benson and Jack Lawrence.  And you guys will give away the tickets when you come back from vacation. 
[02:45:00]  And this is a great exclusive up close, get to see the Raconteurs before the album drops on May 16th.  That's great.  And Steve Kingston set this up?  This is 100% Steve Kingston.  Wow, thanks, Steve.  Five years later, this is great.  This is exactly what we wanted five years ago.  Where is the Hit Factory?  What's that?  Where is the Hit Factory?  I think it's, I'm not sure, but it's in 54th Street on the west side somewhere.  Oh, it's in New York.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's in New York.  This was our dream years ago.  Wow, is this true?  I'll try to forget. 
[02:45:30]  Wait a minute, I'll try to forget.  I just heard Steve Kingston is now keeping the band from appearing on our show.  He booked it for us, and now he's keeping them from being on our show.  I always say water under the bridge.  Water under the bridge.  I say that a lot, with him in cement shoes at the bottom of the water.  I'm going to try to forgive.  I say water under the bridge.  And forget.  So it's Rack and Tours, or Rack and Tours, Rack and Tours, right?  Rack and Tours.  Rack and Tours, the CD's called Broken Boy Soldiers. 
[02:46:00]  I'm hearing it's going to hit the store is April 16th, so I don't know what the real date is.  I guess the U.S. release date is May 16th.  Okay, then I got wrong info.  And we're going to do a listening party with our fans.  That's awesome.  Yeah, and we're going to start doing a lot more of these things with the bands in New York,  and you guys will have them in the studio.  We're going to do more of a little private one-off sessions with bands,  and you guys can bring O&A pests and fans of the Army or whoever.  All right.  Any other announcements today?  Not today.  I think we may have some in the next couple of weeks.  What about the thing?  What about the thing?  Where are we with the thing? 
[02:46:30]  The thing, by the way, I actually, the Addams family is one.  Can you at least admit there's a thing?  Because the New York Radio Message Board still thinks it's just rumors.  There's a thing, right?  You know, at XM, there's always things.  I've got more things going on than I know what to do with.  But what about our thing?  Your thing is great.  Your lights have been ordered.  They're coming in.  The thing.  Damn connection?  Nah.  Elo, our pests think you're really cool.  You've got to give them a little something. 
[02:47:00]  Can't talk about the thing.  But just give them a little something.  Can't talk about the thing.  The thing is the thing.  They want to embrace you.  The thing.  You still live by the.  There's a liquid metal back.  You still live by these corporate rules.  They're holding you back.  They are holding you back.  The pests need something from Elo right now.  Is there a thing or is there not a thing?  Liquid metal's coming back.  I take that as a good sign, though.  All right.  Because I think if there wasn't a thing, Eric would come out and go, nah, no thing for now.  So he's not saying anything means there's obviously a thing. 
[02:47:30]  A possibility.  I'm just going to mess up the thing if he says anything about the thing.  There's a lot of things.  We've got a lot of things coming up.  We're going to have a big couple of weeks with a lot of things.  Talk to the right people about the things.  Make things work.  That's right.  Will Anthony and I be getting phone calls on our satellite phones while we're away?  Well, I don't have your satellite phone number.  I have your number.  See, I can't really take calls on the satellite phone, but I can make calls.  So I will be in constant touch with everybody during vacation.  Opie, does your cell phone work where you're going to be? 
[02:48:00]  I don't know.  You don't know?  It probably will.  Yeah.  If you can't get a hold of them, I have all negotiating power.  You can just call me.  Yes, we are giving Jimmy all power of attorney over all of our business affairs.  Sorry, Jim.  Hey, one guy's saying you don't care about us.  He doesn't return my phone calls.  Did the Pest call you?  I do get several 15, 20 calls a day from Pest.  Well, this one guy, Turtle from Wack Bag. 
[02:48:30]  Turtle, real fast.  Hey, guys.  I've been calling Elo for the past few days to try to get an update on your improvements to your studio.  He has not returned my phone call.  I've left the number with Stephanie, and apparently he doesn't value us at all.  That's a good point, Turtle.  We appreciate the call.  You know, I've got to say something.  I know this is all fun and games, but the guy does work his ass off, and leave him alone because he's trying to get real things done.  I hate to have to say this on our show, but I know the guy works like 12, 16 hours a day. 
[02:49:00]  He doesn't need calls from the Pest.  Oh, what's 17?  All right, Turtle.  What's the next hour?  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right, Elo.  All right, guys.  Have a great vacation.  Bye, sweetie.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  I'll be talking to you.  Absolutely.  All right.  Ciao.  Bye, Eric.  There you go, Zelo.  I'll be in the middle of the Caribbean with my big dopey phone.  Everyone on the – because I've got to walk out onto the, like, deck by the pool with the big satellite phone, and it's got a huge antenna that sticks up.  It looks like the first silver –  A G.I. Joe phone.  It looks like I'm, yeah, calling in an airstrike. 
[02:49:30]  A G.I. Joe phone.  Big antenna comes out.  What's Anthony doing?  Zips in the wire.  Zips in the wire.  They've got to crank it.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I mean zips.  I apologize.  Oh, my God.  I apologize.  I'm really, really, really, really, really sorry.  You're fired.  I meant to say –  I want to apologize for what Jimmy said.  Really sorry.  The management's on this station.  The management doesn't.  Well, I told –  That's exactly 9.58 a.m.  All right, listen.  We've got to get Alan Light in here.  Okay, I had to just – thank you, Eric, very much for looking out the – that's the morning show. 
[02:50:00]  Okay.  I had to thank Eric for doing this.  He went on that puke station.  What's that fucking – what's that just bucket of a station?  KTRS.  That's their promo.  And there are – how many jocks?  16 on-air staff plus syndicated programs, and there's a local farming show, one black  guy on the entire station.  Ah, the token.  One – and he's on the morning show.  It's called – what's it called, this fucking abomination? 
[02:50:30]  An afternoon show.  Whatever it is.  Extend the black thing.  We have one black person that works for XM.  It's Earl.  It's Earl Douglas.  I know that, but we don't pretend to like that.  He's actually –  Isn't he actually the black guy working at that station, too?  I'm sure he is.  Earl Douglas.  Yes, this guy does this thing, the Lane morning show in the afternoon, and they do  the public file.  Here's who's laughing right now.  Ben in the office.  Ah, public file. 
[02:51:00]  I got a post-it from E-Rock, and it has exclamation points, so we don't even dare read  post-its with exclamation points.  Jimmy is the expert on exclamation point post-its.  We have to break now.  Oh.  And then what?  We're very behind.  All right, we got Alan Light coming in next to talk a little music.  You'll know Alan Light when you see him.  You go, oh, you're that guy. 
[02:51:30]  He's on TV all the time and does a great job.  Please email that station with your feelings.  And then we got Joe.  Nothing more than feelings.  No, your feelings and serious emails only.  We got Vito from The Sopranos calling in.  Joe.  Joe Gannascoli.  Isn't he the guy that was sucking dick?  Actually, you're the Italian expert here.  How do you say his last name?  Ah.  Ricotta.  Ricotta.  We got a good question coming in from Kate. 
[02:52:00]  Let's say hi to Kate.  Kate, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Kate.  Um, I want to know when Elo's going to let you guys come out to a truck stop, pull some  kind of shit off for us truckers.  I got to tell you something there, Kate.  It's a very good question. 
[02:52:30]  Uh, Elo, we could go to a truck stop tomorrow.  But quite frankly, we're scared.  Got a little scared at the truck stop.  We're a little scared.  I'll be there to protect you.  This whole trucker mentality thing, we're still trying to get to know.  I mean.  Yeah.  We've been here a year and a half, and we hear you guys are harmless, but we've heard  the stories.  We don't know what to believe.  You guys got a bad rap out there.  You know.  Hey.  If you're on the CB, then you got something to worry about.  Oh.  But just at the truck stop, we're just easy going, easy to get along with. 
[02:53:00]  We love you.  We're your best advertisement out here.  Everybody on the radio constantly.  Hey, man.  Y'all listen to XM202.  Love the truckers.  I'll be the first to admit, the truckers have kept the satellite radio thing alive.  Big time.  Yeah.  Big time.  Because they were the ones that had a drive from city to city going, holy crap, there's  nothing in between cities to listen to.  But hey, we're the ones that bring you the toilet paper and the toilet seats, Anthony, 
[02:53:30]  that people come and crap in, that you need to replace.  Everything is moved by the truck.  The wonderful truck.  Wouldn't 75% of all industries cease if trucks weren't operating?  Yeah.  It could be higher than that.  Hey, you guys.  It's not fair.  You do everything for everybody out there in New York.  And we don't live in New York.  We want to see you guys.  We'll figure.  We will.  We promise.  We'll be out and about.  We love the truckers. 
[02:54:00]  You're animals.  We really do.  See, this is our confusion sometimes.  It's like, we're going to go to Boston in a couple of weeks.  And when we have these meetings behind the scenes, we're like, Boston, truck stop.  Boston, truck stop.  It's a tough decision.  I say we go to a market next.  That has to be made.  I say we go to a market next.  Hold on, sweetie.  We got to go to Sacramento is one we got to do.  And we have to take a silly chance and go to one market that is pure XM audience.  Right.  Go to like a Flying J or a Flying J. 
[02:54:30]  We were just talking about that with Elo.  The Flying J.  All right.  Listen, we got to go.  We're running out of show, Kate.  All right.  Love you guys.  We'll keep that in mind.  We will.  If we could come up with a really good idea, we'll do it.  All right.  Keep her between the ditches.  All right.  Bye, y'all.  Yeah, because you get truckers calling.  They want to go to my brother's restaurant.  They want to know where to park the big rig.  Where can I park my rig?  I don't know.  We don't know how that works.  Ten miles away.  Alan Light, everyone.  How are you, Alan?  I'm all right. 
[02:55:00]  It's good to be here.  We have a really busy show.  And then we got Vito on the line from The Sopranos.  You watch The Sopranos?  I do.  No, I missed this week.  So, you know, I got to catch up.  I was visiting family and the TiVo's waiting.  Let me tell you something.  You didn't miss anything.  That's what everybody's telling you.  Easy, Chief.  Vito.  Yeah.  Hey, buddy.  How are you?  Hey, Joe.  My name is Joe.  His name's Joe.  No, Vito.  No.  His name is Joe.  Hi, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey, Joe.  How you doing, man?  You don't like being called Vito, though? 
[02:55:30]  Well, my name is Joe.  His real name is Joe.  Why would you?  I mean, you don't call Sylvester Stallone or, you know, Rambo, do you?  I think some people do.  If he has his way, you probably will.  The way he fucking won't stop redoing sequels.  He's doing Rocky VI.  See, but Joe, we know you as Vito.  All right.  Well, you can call me Joe.  I play Vito.  Thanks, Joe.  You know, I got to tell you, it reminds me of something.  We became pretty good friends for a while with Barry Williams, you know, Greg Brady, and 
[02:56:00]  I just couldn't call him Barry.  I had to call him Greg every time.  And he didn't like it.  He didn't like it too much either, by the way.  So, who does?  Call me, Vito.  How are you, Joe?  What's going on?  I saw you on Celebrity Fit Club.  I enjoyed your Celebrity Fit Club 2 thing.  You were on...  Yeah, that was such nonsense.  You didn't like the nonsense on Celebrity Fit Club?  What's wrong there, Jimmy?  Well, I mean, you know, it's...  I have a career going.  I mean, you know, I knew I was getting ready for the season. 
[02:56:30]  I'm doing the greatest show on TV.  And, you know, I got to be reeled up by Wendy the Snapper lady.  I mean, you know, it's not the best.  Yeah, why did you decide to do that show, then?  Well, it was a good idea.  I mean, you know, you win prizes, make some money, lose weight.  I mean, what's wrong with that?  But I just said, let me do my thing, get the other people involved.  I don't want to do the nonsense.  Don't make me, you know, all that stupid stuff I don't want to do.  Yeah, how annoying was Wendy the Snapper lady?  She's all right.  I mean, but, you know, to be yelled at by her, I'm on the phone taking an important call, 
[02:57:00]  which wasn't like a team thing we were doing.  It was, like, stupid.  Yeah, she's, like, trying to be the rah-rah lady.  It's like, look, man, I got a real career where you shut up.  And you're not going to lose the weight anyway.  They're going to bring you back for a third season.  You watch.  I mean, you know, Snapper wasn't the, you know, he wasn't doing endorsements or a sponsor.  I mean, but she's a nice kid.  I like Wendy, Wendy, Wendell, Wendy.  Wendy, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Joe, congratulations, by the way. 
[02:57:30]  I'm being promoted to a season regular, man.  That's fantastic.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, I'm having a great year on the show, and this episode coming up three is a big  one for me, and I had a great year on the show, and this is my year.  There's actually a weird scene, because you're one of the more recognizable guys on the show.  I think it was season five.  Is that where Meadows' boyfriend sees you in the car with the security guard?  Yeah, when I drop my keys.  Oh, is that it?  Now, my question is, that was never resolved as anything? 
[02:58:00]  I was wondering, did they, like, tie that in like you were doing coke or something, or was  that really supposed to be what we thought it was?  No, I was, uh, yeah, that was definitely, uh, yeah, I was playing the old, uh, skin swoop there.  Okay.  I wasn't sure if they would bring it back in a later episode and see you doing the same  thing and then show you doing a line or something.  That was one of the most hugely surprising scenes in any show I've ever watched, when  your head came poking up there.  Everyone just went like, holy shit. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, what kind of ribbing did you get behind the scenes when you were filming that?  Were the other guys just kind of ripping you?  I guess none.  Well, I'm doing that scene, it was just me and the security guard and, of course, you  know, a skeleton crew, but...  Yeah, but when everyone came back on set, were they all looking at you like, Joe, man?  Yeah, well, you know...  You know how guys are, it's like Joe.  Yeah.  You know, a lot of guys would say, Joe, if you want me to rehearse you with that scene,  you know?  So, uh, and that was Walnut.  He was, uh... 
[02:59:00]  He, of course, wouldn't do it, you know, he said, I would never do that, and I said, well,  you know, Tony, what am I, you know, I'm an actor, so...  Yeah.  And it was my idea.  I was actually on the wrong end of that scene, you know, it's not what I had in mind.  That's great.  But, you know, it was from a book I was reading, I suggested it, I said, make it interesting,  it happens.  Uh, I want to separate myself from the other actors, I want to give myself, you know, a  chance to really do some stuff instead of being in the background.  So, um, that's exactly what happened.  And that kid, uh, if you see the, uh, the, uh, coming attractions for this week, you know, 
[02:59:30]  he's back.  Yeah.  To me, that makes it more interesting, because, like, you know, as a mobster, you don't see  guys like that behaving like that.  But I'm sure it happens once in a while.  I mean, it's just the odds are, someone's going to have that really, really awful secret  life and be in that tough guy life.  I thought it was fucking great, man.  Yeah, well, it happens in the book I was reading was this guy was openly gay, and, um, they  killed the other guy for being gay on, in Jersey.  So, then I knew they were really thinking about it when they want to know the name of  the book.  So, someone's saying you had a great line in last week's episode. 
[03:00:00]  I'm trying to remember.  Uh, Bob in Cleveland, real fast.  You're on with, uh, Joe.  Hey, Joe.  Hey, the funniest line in the Sopranos this week was when you were at the funeral, you  said, hey, maybe the guy's a fag and he couldn't tell anybody.  Yeah.  Right, I was talking about the guy who hung himself.  Yeah, that's right.  I said maybe he was a homo, and you see the look that Janice gives me.  Later, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  That was, uh, that was Bobby, by the way, who hung himself.  Right.  Who used to work.  Bobby Fennaro.  Yeah.  He used to work at Caroline's, actually. 
[03:00:30]  He was a buddy of mine.  Um, he was there for many years, and then someone said that it was him.  I didn't see last week's episode.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's great, man.  Oh, Bobby Fennaro.  It's a tremendous, tremendous episode in the first episode when he hung himself, and  then he's in the gasket, and, uh, that was pretty funny.  So, is, uh, Tony gonna die?  Hmm.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, I like it.  Yeah, they, uh, they changed it to the Spadafores now.  It's gonna be my show.  Can you imagine?  I wind up blowing everybody.  Start with Frank Vincent.  He's my favorite. 
[03:01:00]  We weren't, uh, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joe, we weren't a big fan of last week's episode,  but it looks like as we move forward from, uh, last, you know, this, this past week, it's  gonna get pretty exciting, because a lot of craziness is gonna happen as Tony recovers  there.  Well, you know, I've been hearing the same thing about the episode of The Dream, people  don't like it, they want to see violence, they want to see the bang, and, you know,  that stuff.  I like it, because it's like, you know, Tony's life is a regular guy, and, uh, it was cool,  sort of like a parallel life, uh, what it would be if it wasn't Tony Soprano, a little mobster,  but I thought it was interesting, and, uh, gives a chance for, uh, you know, to be a little 
[03:01:30]  autistic.  It was our opinion, because we got killed by the listeners, like, oh, you guys don't  get it, you know, this is, uh, part of the show, and blah, blah, blah, but, uh, Anthony  said, you know, gang, we want to see a little more, uh, yeah, some of the, some of the most  memorable, fun, great episodes have always ended with, uh, somebody dying.  Well, you're gonna get plenty of that.  Yeah, one of my favorites, of course, was Joey Pants, when he, uh, whacked that hooker out  back, and then, and then he comes in and puts his hand in the ice bucket and goes, first 
[03:02:00]  of all, she was a hooah.  I love that one.  Just, no, he's like pissed off because he cut his hand on her face or something.  Joe, who are you in Ed Wood?  I play security guard, uh, when, um, Johnny Depp goes on to the, um, the lot.  To steal the, uh, octopus?  Uh, and, uh, he went to go see, like, the studio head.  I guess he was trying to get ready for the movie, and, uh, you know, I don't, he comes  on this jalopy, and I don't believe it's him, and he shows me his, uh, pass, and so I let 
[03:02:30]  him on a small scene, but I got to work with Tim Burton and, uh, Johnny Depp, so it's just  cool.  Yeah, great.  That's a resume stuffer.  So, uh, you got a, you got a book out there, Joe, huh?  I got a book out called A Meal to Die For, um, it's loosely based on my life.  It's about a chef who gambles, and, uh, to get himself out of a hole, it becomes a food  fence, and, uh, you know, he knows how to move stolen shrimp, uh, uh, homemade wine.  He puts phony labels on it, and, uh, bootleg olive oil, and stuff like that, and, um, things 
[03:03:00]  like I did when I was a chef, uh, and I was a gambler, that's how I actually became an  actor, but in the show, he goes to work for the, uh, mob, because they said we can make  big money doing this, forget about what Joe was, and then the head guy says, I want  you to cook the best meal you ever made, uh, so he thinks that maybe he's going to get  whacked if it's his last meal, or maybe someone in the group is a rat, and they're getting  whacked, and, um, you know, it's, uh, about 20 recipes, each recipe leading to the chapter,  and, you know, it's a great story, and actually, my agent is talking to, uh, guys in Hollywood 
[03:03:30]  that want to maybe turn into old weeks, so it's pretty cool.  Have you, uh, written your whole life?  Uh, but no, it's my first book, but it was an interesting story, and the  course, being on a show helps me to get it, you know, published, but, um, you know,  I thought it was, uh, it combines food and mob stuff, what people love.  Very cool.  Yeah, it's called, uh, A Meal to Die For.  Okay.  And, uh, my website, Joe Soup, you know, you can read about the book online and order  it through Amazon, or get it at Barnes & Noble, and, um, uh, Borders, and I guess Friday 
[03:04:00]  I'll be at the 100 Broadway sign-in on, in Wall Street.  Cool.  What's the name of the story you're going to be at?  Uh, Borders, 100 Broadway.  Everybody involved with the Sopranos, uh, in trouble at some point in their life?  Yeah, I was just thinking of committing crimes, like, you always hear the stories come out.  Now, uh, you know, Paulie Walnut's past has come up, and, uh, just...  Yeah, that's old news.  I mean, that, he's been, you know, they, you know, they want to put it there for the day  of the show about real-life guys. 
[03:04:30]  I mean, listen, some of us have crossed the line that, uh, that mutt that did that to  the cop.  I mean, uh, he's, uh, you know, he's a, he's a junkie, and what are you going to do?  But, uh, you know, growing up, you did things as kids, and, I mean, he did a little more  than most of us, but, uh...  Yeah.  We did a few things.  That made me like him more, though.  I mean, I had known that for a long time, I've heard that for years, but it just made me  like him more, that he came from that fucking brutal, you know, uh, lifestyle, and now he's  like a really good actor.  It's, like, kind of encouraging.  Yeah, he did that when he was a kid. 
[03:05:00]  That would happen, like, uh, I don't know, in the early 70s, or late 60s, that he did  that, and, uh...  Dan will lift tons of that job.  I think he was involved with that.  And, uh, he, um, he hasn't done it since.  He's, uh...  Yeah, but he looks like he could still cause a lot of damage still.  Yeah, he is intimidating.  Intimidating.  Great character.  Yeah, he really is an uncomfortable-looking guy.  Hey, Joe, I respect you, man.  I like your honesty about Celebrity Fit Club, because it looked like you were just like,  oh, God, these people are pathetic.  Yeah, I mean, they would ask me stuff, and I go, look, I'm going to tell you exactly where  it is, and I knew they wouldn't use it, but, uh, you know, the stuff with, uh, Hall, who's 
[03:05:30]  a good guy, and, uh, you know, him and Kim, and, you know, so, what do you think  about him and Kim?  I said, what do you mean what I think about him and Kim?  I mean, you know, he's a married guy with, you know, wife, kid, they're going  to be watching the show, what do you want me to say?  Right.  I saw him, you know, she was blowing him in the closet.  Come on.  So.  How much weight did you lose?  I'm down 160.  160 now?  Yeah.  Wow.  You lost 32 on Celebrity Fit Club. 
[03:06:00]  You continue to lose?  I lost 31.  I actually lost 42, but the first week, uh, week and a half, they didn't weigh us until  two weeks after, so I started as soon as I got there, but you see me, uh, I mean, like  in April 3rd, I'm two weeks alone for double hip surgery, uh, from, you know, sort of hereditary,  and I couldn't do a lot of exercises, and they didn't even know it, they should have been  diagnosed then, and I'm hobbling, you see me limping through the show.  Oh, yeah.  I'm, uh, finally getting it done, uh, April 3rd, double hip.  All right, Joe, uh, thank you so much.  The book's called A Meal to Die For, and of course, Vito on The Sopranos, it's a big 
[03:06:30]  week for you, we'll all be, uh, watching.  Thanks, guys.  Call me anytime, you guys were great.  I, uh, we did the show way back when, when I killed Jackie Jr. or something.  All right.  Holy crap, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I, you know, I used to live in Bay Ridge, one of you guys was from Bay Ridge.  Yep, used to live there.  I had a two place on 3rd Avenue, and, uh.  Yeah, I used to, uh, I used to go and eat.  Man, Joe, we'd love to have you come by and just hang out, man.  Yeah, anytime.  As soon as I, you know, like I said, I'm, I'm going in April 3rd, I think I'm going to  be, like, laid up for a little bit, but, uh, we'll keep in touch, tell your producer, and. 
[03:07:00]  All right, we'll throw a little party for you when you're feeling better, all right?  That'll be nice, that'll be nice.  And go to the website, you can see, you know, the whole cast was at my wedding.  I let my, my, you know, you remember Ariel, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah, I met my wife there, I got engaged seven weeks later, and then I got married, I had the whole  cast there, and it was great.  So, I'd love to do the show again, guys, and you guys were great, as usual.  And I guess, uh, our invites were just lost in the mail.  That's, you know, that's what I tell people. 
[03:07:30]  You know what, after, you know, after what happened to you guys, I had no way to find you.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, Joe, thank you so much.  All right, man.  See you.  Continued success for you, buddy.  Thank you, brother.  All right, the book, A Meal to Die For.  There you go.  He was all right.  Yeah, he was really nice.  Joe, Alan, you're going to kill us.  He's been, Alan Light's been waiting to talk for a minute and a half.  Sorry, Alan Light.  Like, I got any place better to be, huh?  This is our last show before vacation, so we're, like, somewhere else.  We've got a lot to get in.  And we got, like, uh, we got some people doing things for the Final Four thing.  Things.  Or the four. 
[03:08:00]  Don't say Final Four.  Or the four remaining teams.  Not allowed.  The bowdog.net.  You've got to call it the four remaining teams.  There's a copyright on that.  Yeah.  Can you believe it?  Just like the Super Bowl.  The big game.  When is someone going to just copyright the big game?  Can't they do that?  Go do it.  Here's your shot.  And then you won't be able to say the big game.  It's mine.  Don't touch it.  It's that thing they do when they throw the ballie.  It's the oblong ball game thing.  Thing.  Ish.  I guess.  Maybe.  Cashing in on everything. 
[03:08:30]  Alan, you have a real history, man.  Like, you really have a lot of stuff on your resume as far as, like, for real rock writer.  For real rock writer?  For real.  It starts to add up to something after a while, I guess.  Let me ask you a question, then, because I'm a Sabbath fanatic.  I just got inducted into the Rock in the Hall of Fame, and I see you wrote for Rolling  Stone.  Why have critics in general...  No, no.  I'm actually asking an honest question.  Let me strap in.  Why have critics in general for years kind of ignored them and passed them over for bands  like Aerosmith and other bands?  Well, you know, a lot of times critics are coming from a different place than listeners 
[03:09:00]  are.  It's a different thing when you've got a constant flow of stuff coming over your desk every  day, and a lot of times things that are just more generally popular, you know, it's easier  to dismiss that and look for something that's different, innovative, interesting in some  other way that stands out from all the stuff that you've been listening to.  And no question, the kind of audience that Sabbath has had, you know, a more general, more  sort of working class audience.  I mean, metal faced that for years in general.  Critics didn't like Zeppelin.  You know, you've got to start from that. 
[03:09:30]  You've got to start from Rolling Stone didn't like Zeppelin and wouldn't cover them.  So there's a certain place that critics go, yeah, oh yeah.  I've always, I've never liked Rolling Stone because they never covered bands I liked.  Right.  And that, and that's, it seems like, but I mean, Aerosmith is in the Rock and Roll Hall of  Yeah, but that took a lot of time.  I mean, in the 70s when they were slugging it out, that was not, they were not exactly  critics' favorites back then either.  I can't get past what you just said.  Rolling Stone didn't like Zeppelin.  What was the problem they had with Zeppelin?  You know, too, you know, that it was too over the top, that it was too histrionic, it's 
[03:10:00]  too loud and just screaming and, you know, all the stuff that, but they just didn't, you  know, critics didn't get it.  And, you know, I grew, I came up, I mean, my book, this book, The Skills to Pay the Bills  about the Beastie Boys, I grew up writing a lot about hip hop and hip hop faced a lot  of that from critics too.  And a lot of that I think is critics don't like the audience or aren't comfortable with  the audience.  You know, they don't necessarily respond to the music and metal faced a lot of that and hip  hop faced a lot of that.  What was the one problem with Black Sabbath as far as not getting the commercial attention?  Not getting critical attention? 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, from the critics and maybe even more airplay for some of their other songs.  Right.  Because we all know the basic Black Sabbath songs.  The couple of hits.  Well, you know, people work within kind of limited, I mean, radio, as you know, works  within a certain set of parameters.  Were they before their time, you think?  I think it's, you know, too, they were too, it's too loud, the songs are too long, it's  too, you know, it doesn't slot in nicely into radio and it doesn't slot in easily.  Next to what, I mean, critics tend to like things that are more, a lot of times more  verbal.  The band wasn't very attractive to look at. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, it wasn't about the photos.  They were too hairy.  Giza Butler said that.  I asked him, too, because he was the main lyricist for Sabbath and they were brilliant lyrics  that people got into them.  So, and he, what a great remark, because he said they just didn't, we're working class  people.  They don't come from that background.  Class is definitely, class is definitely a lot of it.  And look, if the charts looked like what the critics listened to instead of what people  listen to, it'd be a very different world.  Some ways better, some ways worse.  But, you know, again, it's bands like that that took the hit over time. 
[03:11:30]  And you saw it.  It took Sabbath years to get into the Hall of Fame.  It took Skinner years to get into the Hall of Fame.  That's, those are the, a lot of the hardest fights in, you know, within the industry.  Who got in on, like, the first try?  Who wants to got in, like, really early on?  Well, I mean.  Besides the obvious stuff.  Yeah, the obvious stuff in the beginning.  I don't mean, who's gotten in?  I mean, Talking Heads went in first time.  You know, Skinner and Sabbath took, what, five times, six times together?  No, eight.  Eight times.  So, you know.  Eight.  That's good.  You can rattle off the stats.  Oh, he's angry.  It's all about Sabbath and Aussies for Jimmy.  But it's just a lack of respect. 
[03:12:00]  Like, I can understand that it's shitty, like, really hardcore, not good.  But it's great music.  And, like, these are the Talking Heads.  They're not a bad band, but they don't stand up to what Sabbath has done or the influence  Sabbath has had.  Just a different, just a different game.  Just a different game.  The critics liked the Talking Heads a lot more, and they were very innovative for the  time kind of thing.  Who was it?  Was it Zappa that said rock critics like Elvis Costello because they all look like Elvis  Costello?  Good.  So, the book, The Skills to Pay the Bills, the story of the Beastie Boys, right on. 
[03:12:30]  I was going to go to the screening of the Beastie Boys movie tonight, but they canceled  it on me.  Oh, they canceled it tonight's screening?  Well, it opens.  Have you heard about this?  It starts open next week.  You know what they did with this movie?  This concept is amazing.  It's brilliant because it's a brand new thing that no one has done before.  They'd never done a concert movie before, but they didn't want to just do the regular  cliche concert movie.  No one has done anything like this.  The last show at the Garden last fall, they gave, I think, 60 kids in the audience digital  cameras, and they had them all shoot the concert from wherever they were or walking around  the arena. 
[03:13:00]  And they could shoot whatever they want, basically.  You know, took all the cameras back in and edited the concert movie out of that.  So, instead of just being the usual looking at the stage from, you know, a couple of different  angles, it's all around the arena or kids shooting each other or walking around buying  a hot dog or whatever it is.  Right.  And they made that into the movie.  So, you know, these guys, I mean, this year is 20 years since License to Ill came out.  Wow.  When are they going to change it to the Beastie Men?  Well, the last thing, I think the last quote in the book, one of them says, you know,  if we'd known that we were going to be around this long, we never would have called ourselves  the Beastie Boys. 
[03:13:30]  Beastie Boys.  That's like the last thing they said.  Hey, you just gave away the ending to the book.  Yeah, I think you did.  Oh, the end.  It's not, you know, it's not a thriller here.  What made you pick the Beastie Boys?  You know, I've just written a lot about them over the years.  I actually wrote my thesis in college.  About License to Ill.  True story.  And I realized I'd written, I did a big Rolling Stone feature with them.  I did a cover at Vibe.  I did a cover story at Spin.  I just started to gather so much stuff about them.  And the story expands in so many different directions. 
[03:14:00]  I mean, they've changed so much over these 20 years.  Oh, my God.  They started as a goof band.  As total knucklehead novelty band.  They were just making fun of hip hop.  That's the truth, right?  Well, I mean, they loved it.  But they said, we're going to do hip hop our way, like stupid, you know, white middle class  or upper class kids growing up in the city and all the stuff that we see.  And, you know, obviously, License to Ill was a phenomenon.  It was the first hip hop record to go to number one on the charts.  It was the fastest selling debut Columbia Records ever had up to that point. 
[03:14:30]  And, you know, even when we loved that record, I think all of us thought, okay, this is fun,  but we're never going to hear from these clowns again.  And it's 20 years later.  These guys, Beastie Boys could be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next year.  I bet they would get in first or second time.  And I think they will get in first shot.  I think they probably will.  So, you know, I just realized that I had a lot of stuff with them.  And this story opened in a lot of different directions.  And it felt like it made sense to put that together in a book.  When did they, now, they're obsessed, I think, with Mumia Abu-Jamal.  When did they decide to start supporting him? 
[03:15:00]  Or, like, what changed for them?  It seems like they're really radical.  I don't know if they're obsessed.  They did do a couple of benefits for the defense, you know, I think in the late 90s.  Well, they got, you know, these guys got really politically active, socially conscious and aware.  And they did, you know, obviously got really involved in the Tibetan struggle.  The struggle for Tibetan freedom against China did the big benefits there.  For that cause in a couple of different cities for a couple of different years.  And, you know, just got, as they awakened, as their lives changed, as they just turned from, you know, 
[03:15:30]  guys who were on stage throwing beer at each other into more adults and expressing the stuff that they were interested in.  You know, causes like that started to speak to them.  And I think they have such an interesting relationship to hip-hop and to the urban community and wanting to, you know,  they've always been really honest and really respectful about their relationship as, you know,  white kids and privileged white kids drawing on this music and this art form that I think they try to be sensitive 
[03:16:00]  and try to be plugged into the concerns from that community.  Well, I don't think it's, yeah, I don't think it's pandering, but I, but, you know.  If they're being sensitive racially, I mean, I love Eminem.  I think he's brilliant.  The only problem I have with him is he doesn't attack any black targets.  And I think he's great, but he just, it seems like white guys in that genre.  Why are you going to shoot your catch cow?  But you know what I'm saying, though?  But I mean, no, no, I don't even mean as black, attack them because they're black, but attack a black target.  It's like, if you're going to hit somebody.  If you're really going to spray everybody, then spray equal opportunity. 
[03:16:30]  And it's like, Mumia just seems like, I mean, I've read a lot about it.  I'm not an expert, but it seems like such a, I say groveling, maybe that's the wrong word,  pandering cause for black people for a white guy to take.  I mean, they also, even the Beastie Boys got very close to Rage Against the Machine.  They were going to do a tour together and then Mike D fell on his bike and broke his shoulder  and couldn't do the tour.  But that was a time when they were hanging around a lot with the Rage guys.  And I think a lot of the real initiative for that came more from Zach and from the Rage  Against the Machine team. 
[03:17:00]  And they sort of went on for the ride.  And, but you know, you gotta be, it's, they've always had this balance for, you know, for  a couple of decades now of how much do people want them to be serious and how much do they  still want them to be goofballs like when they started.  This is definitely a book I'll read.  The Skills to Pay the Bills, The Story of the Beastie Boys.  Hey, can I say this?  Can I say that?  We don't give the name of the movie and I want to say it cause this is the only interview  where I can give the full title of the movie.  The movie's called Awesome.  I fucking shot that.  Right.  Everywhere else I gotta clean that up. 
[03:17:30]  Here I get to say the whole thing.  So I want my shot.  I'm so bummed I can't see a screening of that tonight.  I was really looking forward to it cause the concept like we discussed sounds really,  really cool.  See, I got lucky.  I was years late turning in this book and then it comes out and a couple weeks later they  open a movie and then I get to go and do this stuff.  I love the style of this.  It's all like these little blurbs from people.  It's like, it's like a really, it's like probably you could just read it and you could actually  turn a few pages and read the next chapter.  I love books like this that you don't have to be, you don't have to go through the boring  fucking biography.  And her parents came over on the boat and I tell you, who gave a shit?  Very interesting.  I mean, I talked to 75 or 80 people for this book. 
[03:18:00]  I talked to everybody that worked with them, all the producers, their friends.  And you don't squeeze too many words on the pages.  It's just right.  It's not too big.  It's not too squished.  And so I thought I'd do it this oral history way and let them tell the story.  Nobody wants to listen to me tell the story.  Let them tell the story.  I got to ask a hack question.  You've interviewed just about everybody, right?  Who is, who is your favorite?  Who is your favorite interview and why?  Well, the best, best interviews, I always say the best ones are, there's Bono and there's  Ice-T cause those two guys are always on.  Like no matter what, if it's for one sentence for something or if it's for a cover story, 
[03:18:30]  they're completely on all the time.  So you know you're going to get stuff that's great.  The most sort of powerful to me, I did it like one of the last interviews that Curtis  Mayfield did when he was, after his accident and he was quadriplegic and laid up in his  bed and I spent a couple of days with him and that was kind of the most emotional one  because I love all those old soul records, old R&B records.  What kind of accent did he have?  He got hit by a lighting ring on stage and was, you know, paralyzed from the neck down  and he died, you know, a few years ago. 
[03:19:00]  How long was he paralyzed for?  A long time.  He was five, six years, I think, from then until he died.  Okay.  It was like around 90, a little longer maybe, something like that.  And just the sweetest, like an unbelievable guy and so powerful and that was like the heaviest  thing to do, to sit at his bedside and do that.  But in terms of just the, you know, the straight up merit of the soundbite, I just talked to  Ice-T again recently.  I'm sure he's been on the show and he's just always on fire.  So I did the Rolling Stone cover when he was in the cop uniform, when Cop Killer was 
[03:19:30]  out and that's, you know, that's just, you know, you know it's going to be great.  You know, he's just going to come with the best list.  He's going to hold back.  What about Johnny Cash?  That was an amazing thing to do.  I did one of the last interviews that Cash did when his last record, when the album  with Hurt came out and I went down to the-  One of the most amazing songs ever recorded, by the way.  And I went down to his home studio outside of Nashville on the farm and we recorded,  it was to do like a radio special because they didn't know if he was going to be well  enough to do much press so they wanted to get one, you know, that they could send out 
[03:20:00]  if they needed and we did it, you know, full engine, full sound, you know, full thing  at his home studio and it was really-  What was up on the walls as you were interviewing him?  It was pretty simple.  Do you remember?  It's like, it was a little one room cabin, you know, it had a board on one side and just  had like a little, we did it at sort of like a kitchen table and, you know, he was, he  was, he was visibly, he was not well and he wasn't strong.  He could do like 20 minutes at a time and be really present.  He was really strong and it was, you know, amazing to sit there with him but he'd really,  he'd need to rest about every 20 minutes to do it and that's, I mean, just the privilege 
[03:20:30]  of sitting with somebody with that history and being able to spend some time with him  was, it was an amazing thing.  And obviously all the attention now that's coming around with the movie and the Broadway  show and these new collections and, you know.  Did you like Walk the Line?  You know, I loved the performances.  I thought the two of them were great.  I thought that the movie-  Jimmy loved Joaquin's portrayal of Johnny Cash.  Jimmy's a big Johnny Cash fan too.  He was so taken by it.  He hated Joaquin Phoenix.  Hated it?  Well, I felt that when you get a guy like Val Kilmer who sang in The Doors and you get  a great job Jamie Foxx did as Ray. 
[03:21:00]  I mean, I think if you're going to have somebody, they can CGI King Kong, they can CGI a good  lip sync of Ghost Riders in the Sky.  There's no reason for him to sing it because he sounded, looked, and nothing like-  The only thing I'll say in that defense is it's always weird watching those movies and  you're watching an actor and then they start to sing and all of a sudden Johnny Cash's  voice comes out and you're like, well, what the hell, you know, and I thought it was-  I get why they tried to do that and I thought it was good enough.  It actually made me appreciate that Ray was really pretty good because they actually told 
[03:21:30]  the story and got at the music.  I thought what was missing in Walk the Line was a sense of the music.  Absolutely.  You got their relationship, but you didn't get like, why was he important?  What did he do?  What was the music of it?  They kind of lost that part of it.  Because he wasn't good enough to pull-  They should have gotten an unknown.  I'm sure there's somebody out there that could do an amazing Johnny Cash and sing a great Johnny  Cash and that's probably who they should have gotten instead of him.  I don't think he looked like it.  It more sounded like I just, I was going, ugh, the entire film.  Hey, yeah, we got a slight problem here.  What's the problem?  We have to give away this trip.  We have like 15 minutes left in the show. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, we got it.  And if we don't do it, I don't know what will happen.  Son of a bitch.  Sponsorships.  We are not on tomorrow because we're going on vacation.  Can you tell?  We're in such a big place.  Yeah, I see.  Two both eyes on the clock.  Yeah, we're like, I got it.  For many reasons.  We know we have to get these guys in.  We should at least bring them in and see what they're going to do for the four remaining  teams of the NCAA tournament.  Can you say tournament?  Yeah, I think so.  Or bracket thing.  Who do you think is going to win American Idol? 
[03:22:30]  Oh, I got, I have no patience for any of that stuff.  None of that shit.  I was wondering.  I didn't watch any of that.  No?  I got hooked into it this year, I got to admit.  Yeah, I mean, I can see how any of these you can get, you know, you can get strung out  on them, but I stay clear, man.  I got enough.  I got enough to worry about.  I don't need that.  One guy, though.  That Chris guy's good.  Got to check him out.  Yeah.  Hey, who are you?  I'm a Chris also.  Oh, that worked out nicely.  Didn't it?  Nice segue.  Yes.  And what do you have in that bag? 
[03:23:00]  Tools of the trade.  Tweezers and a mirror.  All right, tweezers and a mirror.  Here's the guy.  We were asking for some kind of outrageous thing to do to win this trip to the final five  double-A basketball game in Indianapolis.  Minus one.  Courtesy.  Plus two.  Minus three.  By the way, courtesy is spelled C-U-R-T-I-S-Y of bowdog.net.  That's not right?  I have no idea.  And you got to trust that those tickets are going to be on the right day, too, if that's 
[03:23:30]  where you're starting from.  Holy crap.  But I just read what Chris wants to do with the tweezers.  Yeah, did you see that?  Are you kidding me?  No.  Now, have you done this before?  Well, a little bit here and there just to give it a test.  What do you want to do?  Just pull out the stubble, not the goatee, because I look silly without a goatee, but  just my facial hair, basically.  There is stubble there.  It's kind of hard to see from over there.  But I haven't shaved since Sunday.  Will you pull out a couple of goatee hairs and the tweezers?  I can do that, too.  So, you know, underneath. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  So it's not like a big thing.  All right.  You know, we've got to see some hair.  Pull out some bag hair if you want.  Yeah, we would like that a lot.  I think bag hair is a good bet.  Bag hair with the tweezers?  That's a little trim, though.  What is Patty doing here?  I don't know.  Oh, well, that's for the other guy, Rob, from Jackson, New Jersey.  Is he going to fuck her?  No.  I'm not that fucking disgusting.  Are you guys big college basketball fans?  Absolutely.  Yeah?  Yep.  I'm going to suck Patty's toes, if you'll allow me. 
[03:24:30]  Wow.  And maybe bite one off and spit in her face.  She's got...  She's had hammer toe surgery, but it didn't go so well.  Well, Patty, why don't you show Alan Light your toes?  We'll press for time.  Don't be shy.  All right.  There's no time for shyness here.  All righty.  Oh, E.T. body.  Those jeans are...  There's the socks.  Yeah, where'd you get those jeans?  Wow.  Obviously, when David Lee Roth was singing for Van Halen.  I guess so.  They just want to tie in the music thing with Alan. 
[03:25:00]  Yes, my toe.  Wait, get it up on the counter.  My toe.  They fixed your hammer toes.  What, did they fix them with an anvil?  I don't know.  Nothing?  All right.  We're going on vacation.  We're not listening anymore.  Are the toes bad?  Jimmy, I can't see from here.  It's just...  The big toenail.  It depends on what living creature they're on.  I have ugly feet.  What living creature they're on.  All right.  That's funny, Jimmy.  For a sleet stack or pterodactyl, they're in great shape. 
[03:25:30]  For a human being, she should be beheaded.  I can't.  Yuck.  All right.  How are we going to do this excitement?  It's just overwhelming.  Well, I mean, just...  I can't shame myself.  Just bring down the house.  I got to tell you.  All right.  Well, do you want to start picking out hairs?  Danny?  Could you put the camera on the edge there real close  so they can get right up to it with their disgusting things  that they're going to be doing here?  See, the tweezer thing's no big deal.  My bro's in studio today with us.  I mean, we get these crazy eyebrow hairs 
[03:26:00]  that we've got to pluck out all the time.  I've got freaking hair growing on the tip of my nose  that I've got to pull a hair out of your bag.  Tweezer out.  Oh, are we going with the ball bag hair?  You have to.  Because I'm thinking any other hair,  I get these weird, thick, dark, black ones in my beard  that I'm pouring out all the time.  Yeah, if he wants to move in here, I'll...  Because I...  That's why I sit here, by the way.  All I'm saying is the tweezer thing, to me and my bro,  not that impressive, right?  Yeah.  But from the yam bag, it would be.  The yam bag.  I can just pull out a whole big chunk of... 
[03:26:30]  Atta boy.  Without the ante.  I'm just trying to help you win the contest, by the way.  I'm not...  You know.  And then the toe-sucking...  Whatever.  But it's really kind of disgusting.  Exactly.  I'd rather have you listen to her talk for five minutes.  We're out there for two hours.  Huh?  How much time?  I just heard...  Go, go, go.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  All right.  Here he is.  Can I pull my bag out?  Please do it, fella.  The brain. 
[03:27:00]  Here comes the brain.  Welcome to the show, Alan.  I'm really sweaty in there.  And, Alan, we like you a lot.  We want you to come back.  This doesn't represent what we usually do.  This is how you show a guy a good time.  It doesn't really hurt that much.  We like talking music on this program, but...  You want to watch it pull the skin?  You got a camera on that?  Yeah.  I have questions about Kurt Cobain I want to ask you.  Instead, I'm watching a guy pull freaking ball hair out of his bag with tweezers.  There's a couple for you.  That's really disturbing.  Yeah.  There's a whole bunch of them.  What's really disturbing is the smell. 
[03:27:30]  Who's going to clean it up?  Where did that smell come from?  Stop it.  Does he have onion bag?  I don't know.  There's a nice long one.  It's probably...  Iraq, what's going on over there?  Nice and sweaty.  I'm not even looking.  I'm not even looking.  Where are you dropping those hairs?  Yeah.  Where is he dropping his ball hair?  Jesus, dude.  Keep count of them.  For just such an emergency.  We got PalTalk cameras, and they're loving the fact that...  I got to get the long ones.  ...that you're pulling hair out of your ball bag.  Oh.  Man, let's just go for it with their hands. 
[03:28:00]  God, this is...  The only time I've wanted to bounce our own camera here in the studio.  This is a...  Really?  He's pulling and pulling.  I got to get the ones from the bottom.  This guy is just pulling hair hoping that it's going to get more exciting, and I got to tell you, I...  I don't see it happening.  I don't really see it happening.  Unless he smacks it with a mallet.  Exactly.  I could put some of my water and drink it.  You might have to pull a nice chunk of goatee hair out or something.  That's what I'm trying to say.  I can do that, too.  All right.  Well, that was impressive.  He pulled out how many hairs from the ball bag? 
[03:28:30]  Thirty-five.  A buttload of them.  A buttload?  Okay.  A buttload of bag hair.  I'm just trying to help you win the trip.  It's a good trip to Indianapolis.  Courtesy of bowdog.net.  You want some goatee hairs?  Yeah.  I don't even need a mirror for that.  As much?  Three minutes left?  Ugh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A chunk for you?  I've never seen more Zs typed in my life.  I know.  That's the feedback.  So many Zs are being typed in.  Folks, you don't understand.  There's hairs being pulled out. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, I know.  Boring.  I don't understand it.  Boring spelled with 20 O's.  Yeah.  I got the one with a bunch of R's.  Right.  Like, boring.  That's the one I got.  Not the boring.  Alan, can you hold this out?  The book is called The Skills to...  Tell me what you need from me.  The Skills to Pay the Bills.  All right.  Well, let's thank Chris for pulling hair out.  Cool.  All right.  And that's excellent.  Now, what are you going to do?  Are you going to read a library book?  Yeah, absolutely.  Slowly.  All right.  This is an amazing, amazing climax before the big break. 
[03:29:30]  Unbelievable.  Yeah, this is what you get to take with you for a week.  I know.  Wow.  The PalTalk people are just really enjoying the video from this.  These are the same people that got to watch someone taser their asshole.  Right, right.  Gentlemen.  Oh, look how dirty her feet are, though.  All right.  That's disgusting.  Get that camera right on there.  Can we please get the maximum amount of disgust?  Wait, who's aiming the camera?  Yeah, come on.  I'm going to aim the PalTalk camera before I slap your faces.  Just get it right up there.  All right.  Very good. 
[03:30:00]  Tham is directing.  Get a nice close-up.  All right.  This is courtesy of Bodog.net.  Trip to the NCAA basketball game in Indianapolis, courtesy of Bodog.net.  What do you paint your toes with?  A flamethrower?  Oh, cadaver foot.  All right.  This is Rob from Jackson, New Jersey.  I've got a tag hanging from it.  Harbour feet.  Oh, God.  And Rob is now sucking on Stalker Patty's big toe.  I don't know.  I think you're going to have to work it a little more than that for the trip, Rob.  A little more than...  How does that feel?  Deep-throating Stalker Patty's big toe. 
[03:30:30]  The PalTalk is riveting.  Okay.  We've got to win them.  We're right.  We've got to win them.  No, no.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I don't know.  I don't know if this is enough.  You might want to lick the bottom of her foot that is pretty much brown.  There you go.  Chew off one of the corns.  Keep going, Rob.  I'm not really sure.  I want to thank Outer Life for stopping by.  The skills to pay the bills. 
[03:31:00]  The story of the Beastie Boys.  It's a book I'm going to definitely read.  Oh, God.  From Jackson, New Jersey.  He's doing it for the love of it now.  Lick the hammer part.  Lick the hammer.  Yeah, keep licking.  Keep licking and sucking.  I don't know.  The grand finale, Rob.  What do you think?  Throw as many toes in your mouth as possible.  Yeah, get the whole foot in your mouth.  That hurts.  It doesn't hurt.  Yes, it does hurt.  I can't balance that.  It hurts us.  Shut up.  It hurts us. 
[03:31:30]  Trust me.  He's going.  That's not up to you.  What do you guys think?  Chris ripping hair out of him with the tweezers or Rob from Jackson, New Jersey sucking on Patty's toes?  I need crickets on myself.  Five seconds.  Tweezers.  Let's give it to the tweezers.  Rob, Rob, Rob.  Put Jetson.  Put Jetson.  No.  Put Jetson.  We conclude our podcast.  New B&M Anthony Show. </pre>
