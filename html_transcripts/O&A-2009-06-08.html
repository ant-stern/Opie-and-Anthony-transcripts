<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a morbid discussion of a photo depicting David Carradine's death scene, followed by speculation about his lifestyle and the circumstances of his death.  This transitioned into a discussion of Brett Michaels' Tony Awards accident, with the hosts expressing a desire to see alternative camera angles of the incident.  They then launched into a movie review segment, focusing on the box office failures of "Land of the Lost" (including mocking the original show's opening credits) and the success of "The Hangover."  A lengthy segment followed on their preferences for different sports, comparing the pacing and excitement of basketball, football, baseball, and hockey, filled with comedic tangents and vulgar interjections.  The discussion concluded with commentary on a viral video of a topless gymnast, accompanied by sexually explicit comments, and further discussion of "Downfall" and its internet memes, with a brief mention of Ed Asner and a past interaction with him on the show.

Anthony then detailed his ongoing struggles with a faulty pool heater installation and exorbitant electricity bills, humorously blaming the latter on his lighting choices for after-work activities. He recounted a funny anecdote about retrieving a neighbor's toy bird. A humorous misinterpretation of a transcribed phrase led to further wordplay.  The show then covered several news stories: a man found dead in his van with numerous parking tickets, the arrest of a 17-year-old for the rape and murder of an 8-month-old child (eliciting strong reactions), a death sentence in a wildfire case (with discussion of appeals), an exceptionally precocious 11-year-old college graduate, and a 90-year-old receiving her high school diploma.  A phone call with Brett Michaels' tour manager, Pete, provided details about Michaels' injuries. The segment concluded with a recurring bit about Anthony's fictional high school return, filled with exaggerated scenarios and caller contributions about their own gym class experiences. Pat Fumonaki was mentioned as having visited Anthony's house.

Listener calls continued the high school theme, focusing on negative gym teacher interactions and the absurdity of gym class for athletic individuals.  This led to a discussion about Navy SEAL training, fueled by caller anecdotes and a retired SEAL's insights into "Hell Week."  Callers shared their own military training experiences, highlighting the physical and mental rigors.  A comedic bit by Primetime Sam Roberts about a conversation between the show's intern, David, and Bobo, centered around Bobo's Sean John jeans and racial stereotypes.  The show also covered the upcoming iPhone announcement, the Air France plane crash (with discussion of a possible pitot tube malfunction), and the Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt scandal from "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!"

The show then shifted to a discussion of the technological convergence of cell phones, cameras, and video cameras, comparing iPhones and BlackBerrys and speculating on future integration.  A significant portion was dedicated to critiquing "I'm a Celebrity...", focusing on Spencer Pratt ("Spidey") and Heidi Montag's behavior, along with other contestants like Tori Wilson and John Salley.  Audio clips from the show were played, highlighting Spencer's complaints, Heidi's tears, and Spencer's change of heart. The hosts commented on the show's short duration and implied luxurious off-camera conditions.  The segment included wordplay with the hosts' names, speculation about Lou Diamond Phillips' ex-wife, vulgar jokes, and commentary on John Salley's bowel movements.  Britney Spears' topless photos and a leaked Lady Gaga music video were discussed, along with a call from a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner disputing Spencer Pratt's black belt claim.  The Brett Michaels injury was revisited with further details from his tour manager.

The final segment began with a recounting of a recent "Tonight Show" appearance and a disagreement with a producer about promoting the hosts' book and show.  This transitioned into a discussion of Spencer Pratt's disastrous appearance on David Letterman's show, with the hosts finding amusement in Letterman's mocking of Pratt and Heidi Montag.  The conversation then turned to celebrities' high fees for nightclub appearances, leading to a critique of one host's perceived arrogance.  The discussion returned to Letterman’s interview with Pratt, followed by a brief technical issue with the online feed. During the interruption, Steve's flamboyant pants were described.  Upon restoring the online feed, rumors surrounding Sirius XM and Apple, and AT&T's phone service were discussed.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a comedic short about one of the hosts returning to high school for his diploma, followed by further discussion about the online feed issues and a news story about a man playing with feces on a train, ending with a discussion of the hosts' own bowel movements and a brief mention of Mars' birthday.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  And it's Monday.  Quickly look at the David Carradine death photo because they're going to be getting rid of that immediately.  It's hard to get rid of stuff off of the intertubes.  True.  You know, if they take it over there, it's already out.  So people just right-click and save it, put it on other shit.  So, there it is. We just were looking at it. 
[00:00:30]  It's a nice Monday morning thing to look at.  A nice morbid way to start another week of radio.  Dead Kung Fu.  The photo is, uh, not that great.  Nah, it's nothing, you know, it's not like, oh my god.  You can't see his face. It's taken from the back.  I think the door or something is kind of blocking half of the body.  Uh, a lot of room, so it's not like, uh, close-up on him.  But, uh, pretty sick.  A little sick. 
[00:01:00]  I've seen so much worse on the internet.  It's not like anything's shocking.  Years ago, that would have been like, oh my god.  Of course it would have.  Now it's just like, uh, what about the close-up on the face with the, you know, purple lips and the fucking, you know,  the rope tied around the genitals.  But his hands are tied above his head, right?  Yeah, it looks like his hands are bound above his head, which is like, how do you do that by yourself?  Unless somebody else was in that room.  Yeah, that's, that's what, uh...  And maybe things went awry, and this person said, fuck this, I'm out of here. 
[00:01:30]  The old, uh, 23 skidoo out the, uh, out the door.  Uh, apparently some divorce papers were, um, uh, got out that said his ex-wife was saying that, uh,  one of the things that she was complaining about was his, his unsafe sexual practices.  So he was a dirty, dirty boy, apparently.  And, uh, this might have been one of those things where he liked doing stuff like this.  And, uh, oops.  How bad do you need to get off, though?  It just becomes one of those things. 
[00:02:00]  You like doing it, I guess, uh, you like doing it.  Yeah, but that just seems complicated.  It really does.  I need a rope around my genitals.  All right, where am I going to put that rope?  Where can I hang my hands?  Or have rope, where can we get rope?  Right.  This is a big production, isn't it?  It really is.  Tie me a sheep shank.  We have to go to the Hard War Stair to cook.  Oh.  Oh, that didn't take a long time.  Hard War Stair?  Hard War Stair?  I'm tired.  Hard War Stair?  I wanted to say Hard War Stair.  Of course you did.  What else could you have wanted to?  You just said Worcester, I think.  Hard War Stair. 
[00:02:30]  Worcester.  Worcester.  Uh, how do they get the death photo there, Steve, before they get rid of that?  This one is on iReport.com.  Oh, that's easy.  Yeah.  That's easy for everybody.  iReport.com.  I-R-E-Y-A.  I.  I-R-E-P-O-R-T dot com.  The letter I, not like the eyeball.  Yeah, but it's in the paper today.  The family outraged that that photo's out there.  So most of these sites will get rid of it.  It is a little outraging.  If you're a family, I would gather. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  But, um, yeah, it seems to be one of those sexual things gone awry and not so much a,  uh, he wanted to kill himself thing.  And Rob Schneider was on CNN last night basically saying he, he, there's no way he would have  killed him.  They're still playing that angle.  How's Rob Schneider know him?  I, I, maybe they were doing a movie together or something.  I don't know.  Oh, then maybe he was killing himself.  Jesus.  Career is a shitter.  But, uh, yeah, they're still going with that angle.  He would never kill himself. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  We know.  It's getting, it's becoming pretty obvious what he was doing.  Yeah.  He was a dirty little monkey, wasn't he?  And he made a bit of a mistake.  Yeah.  A miscalculation.  Yeah.  Dirty.  So we got that picture to check out.  Uh, a video I didn't see because guess what?  I don't watch the Tony Awards.  Who does?  Oh.  Who came in here?  Half the staff all excited.  I saw it.  Yeah.  Half the staff comes in here all excited.  Did you see the Tony Awards last night? 
[00:04:00]  No.  Why would we see the Tony Awards and, and, and watch what?  The, the play Billy Elliot wins stuff?  Who cares?  Oh, yeah.  No wonder.  The three kids that play Billy Elliot won, uh, uh, uh, Tony Awards.  A combined Tony?  Yeah.  Combined Tony, of course.  But there was, the, the, the judges were probably drooling over the young, hairless  little boys.  Stop it.  But there is a reason to watch the Tony Awards last night.  Oh, my God.  Our pal, Brett Michaels, who's done this show many, many times, pretty much knocked himself 
[00:04:30]  out last night.  He got knocked the fuck out.  Was he all right after this?  The, uh, he, his camp isn't saying anything, but, uh, the Tony said, uh, the Tony, uh, spokesperson  said that he just missed his mark and he's fine.  But why was poison opening up the Tony's?  Yeah.  That's a good question.  That's a little weird to begin with.  Rock of Ages.  Rock of Ages.  Thank you.  Okay.  Ah, that makes sense.  The Rock of Ages is doing very well on Broadway.  So, you get poison. 
[00:05:00]  Were they singing nothing but a good time?  Yeah, that was what they were.  It was a part of a, uh, a long ten minute long opening number.  And then, and he has to be a ham is what happened.  He wanted, uh, that last bit of stage time to stand in front while all the other musicians  were, were getting off of the stage and kind of onto the drum riser to the back of the set.  Yeah, they were pushing backwards.  This giant fucking block.  NHL scoreboard size thing is being lowered down.  And he's like at the front of the stage still going like, hey. 
[00:05:30]  And then he turns around to walk back with the rest of the band.  But this thing got too low, and I guess his cowboy hat brim blocked his view.  He's skipping, and it smacks him.  It comes down, and he runs right into it pretty much.  He skips face first right into this giant piece of scenery.  Was he knocked out by that?  I don't know, because it stops right there.  Did the thing squish him?  Is, is Brent Michaels alive today?  Do we know that much?  He is.  He's around.  He's obviously in town. 
[00:06:00]  I put words out to his guys to get him to see if he'll call in.  But I, I, I want to see other camera angles, because the main camera cut right away and  went somewhere else.  Yeah, why?  Which again, why would you just, why wouldn't you just show that and, and get some laughs?  They probably pan to people laughing.  But there's, you know, there's a fuckload of cameras during those things, so I, I, I can't  wait to see the footage that finally comes out.  The video's going to do very well today.  Where he just hits the floor.  We're trying to get someone from his camp to call the show. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  I'm sure he's all right.  Yeah, yeah.  If he wasn't, I mean, uh.  But look what we missed, because we didn't watch the Tonys, Ant.  The Tonys.  If, that's the one you just don't watch unless, you know, you're a little, if you're a little,  yeah.  For real, why would you watch, watch the Tonys?  I'm trying to think is, if there would ever be a reason to watch the Tonys.  You know what the odd thing about the Tonys is, as opposed to the, uh, Grammys, the Emmys,  the Oscars, uh, take the Academy Awards, if you will.  It's something that, uh, a lot of the nominated movies and stuff, people have seen. 
[00:07:00]  You see, like, a lot of the movies.  You might miss a few, but for the most part, Grammys, you've heard the songs.  Emmys, you've seen the TV shows.  Or at least you know about them.  The Tonys, it's like, who goes to all these shows and is sitting there going, oh, let me  see, oh, who's going to win Best Actor, and I'm here, it's like, oh, oh, Best Revival,  oh, Guys and Dolls.  Yeah, it's like, who can't, no one has seen it all. 
[00:07:30]  It's, so you sit there going, I don't know what this is, I don't know who this is, I  don't care.  It looks like any other awards show, but you don't know anyone.  But you don't know one goddamn person.  That's exactly why no one gives a shit.  And if you do take a peek, these people will go on stage to get their award, and everyone  is like, oh, of course he should have won.  I can't believe.  They all know the person, and it's really just, it's a shit.  And the winner, Bruce Mitchelson, oh my god, I knew Bruce would win, when Bruce Mitchelson 
[00:08:00]  got up and won, I said, what?  And you're at home scratching your head, who's Bruce?  Who is that?  Who is this guy?  You don't know who, was he ever in a movie?  Yeah.  Let me look at him on IMDb, alright?  Second bartender in.  Can you name one person in Mamma Mia or in any big play that's out?  Holy shit, are you kidding me?  Except like when Broderick or Nathan Lane do them.  Yeah, yeah, when you get the gimmick guys in, or, you know, Broderick and Nathan Lane, 
[00:08:30]  of course, they've done a lot of the musical comedies and things.  Yeah, I was going to say, I know one person on Broadway, Nathan Lane.  You just got to assume he's in something.  Yeah, he's in something.  He's got to be.  Alright.  Hey, speaking of movies, Land of the Lost, First Bomb of the Summer, my friends.  He wasn't actually a guy.  You found Bruce Mickelson?  Bruce Mickelson.  Oh, close enough.  Yeah.  Land of the Lost is the first bomb of the summer movie season.  And what a surprise, Opie, because from the trailers and everything, I was thinking, this 
[00:09:00]  looks hysterical.  And it's based on a show that was so well done, so well received, and very mature.  Or, do they think, like, just dredging up old crap and redoing it means a hit?  Well, it was a trend for a while, and it did very well, but I think it's time to move on  from that, and start getting some original projects made again. 
[00:09:30]  Original what?  Like someone actually writing something new?  Oh, sure.  Yeah, they got lazy in Hollywood.  What?  Yep, the Land of the Lost is a sign that they got to move away from just remaking every  single old TV show.  If you look at the original show, the guy who played the dad in Land of the Lost, he's  the creepiest looking guy in a sitcom ever.  Steve, can you find him?  I don't mean to interrupt you while you're texting.  Can you please, though?  As he finds that, I gotta tell you, I never watched Land of the Lost.  I don't think I watched one episode of that thing.  It's the worst show ever.  So why would you remake it?  The opening sequence. 
[00:10:00]  That's pretty good.  That's realistic.  Is so bad.  They're rafting, and somehow it gets sucked down this river, which is a little stream of  water that has to be two inches wide, with them superimposed horrifically in it.  Wow.  And then the dinosaurs are claymation.  That show costs $40 an episode to make.  And I think Jimmy said it last week, why would you make a dinosaur movie after Jurassic Park?  What are you trying to accomplish?  Because even, I know they've gotten even better with special effects, but you watch 
[00:10:30]  that Jurassic Park, it still freaking holds up.  That T-Rex holds up, man.  It still holds up.  Looks great.  I'm trying to, I'm going to get Steve to YouTube the opening scene so you can see it  all, but if you've never seen it, it's really bad.  The song is really catchy and good.  The song is horrible.  The video, just ridiculous.  I want this stuck in people's heads, though.  The last part.  Yeah, yeah.  Land.  Here it is.  Marshall, Will, and Holly.  Marshall, Will, and Holly.  On a routine expedition. 
[00:11:00]  Routine.  As the greatest earthquake ever known.  Oh, my God.  Look at how horrendous this is.  Oh, my God.  It struck their tiny wrath.  Ah!  And put them down.  Then they fall down a waterfall.  Deep below.  Of course, it's Sid and Marty Cross.  To the land of the lost.  They probably thought that looked really good for the time, you know.  I think they did. 
[00:11:30]  Oh!  Ah!  Look at the dinosaur.  He looks like a half-web doody.  Come on!  Bill!  Come on, Holly!  Go!  Come on!  Come on!  To the land of the lost.  And what kind of routine expedition is the father, son, and a daughter?  Oh, there's a camera involved.  Thank God they found that cave at the end. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Ah!  And then a T-Rex comes after the camera.  Opie, do you know who Chaka is?  Yeah, I mean, just because I've been around, you know, Earth for a while.  You know?  I never searched out that show when I was growing up.  That little piss stream they were going down in the draft.  Amazing.  It's awful.  Like sperm.  Yeah, amazing.  They couldn't have found a little more water.  That was like a Vas-Devrens.  Is that what the cockman is called?  The Vas-Devrens.  It's where these semen comes through. 
[00:12:30]  The sperm swim through.  A little good Vas-Devrens reference.  Vas-Devrens.  It's a great movie star name.  Vas-Devrens in.  Did you see Vas-Devrens on the Tonys?  Yes.  Fantastic.  He won for coming home.  Number one movie at the box office.  Anyone want to guess?  Close race this week.  Close race.  Number one.  It's not Zach Galifianakis' movie, is it?  Land of the Lost.  That's doing well.  The Hangover is a hit. 
[00:13:00]  Yep.  Yeah.  I can't tell you how many people said,  holy shit, you've got to see The Hangover this weekend.  Really?  Because the trailer looked a little too goofy.  I thought so too, Anne.  I was like, ah, it's goofy.  The reviews are really good, and word of mouth is really good on The Hangover.  I mean, really good.  And it came in second.  Second?  Yes.  It did 43.2 million.  That's real good.  But I think The Word of Mouth is going to give it 43.2, but it's got a nice word of mouth.  I bet you that next week is going to do just as well. 
[00:13:30]  It'll be right up there, the numbers.  Yeah, I wouldn't have gotten to see it because it just looked goofy.  The trailer was shaky, right?  Yeah.  But they're saying there's a lot of funny scenes in that.  Up, number one again.  Oh, the old...  That looks really good, but Jimmy doesn't like the cartoons.  Which one?  I like to still call them cartoons.  He puts the balloons on his house?  Yeah, the old guy putting the balloons on his house.  The old guy with balloons on his house.  And then he goes on a little adventure.  You got balloon hands.  Fucking balloon hands.  Oh yeah, fuck you.  Fuck you.  Wait, go for a ride. 
[00:14:00]  Fuck you.  No way, no how.  No way, no how.  Balloon hands.  Dude, that's balloon hands.  That guy is so funny.  You can't not...  His voice is wonderful.  It's soothing.  It's funny.  Yes.  It's sexual.  He never gets very upset about what he's talking about.  It's just, get out of here.  Get out of here.  Come on.  Fuck you.  When Bill described it, Bill Burr turned us on to that.  And I was like, it didn't sound good.  But when you watch that fucking gecko or whatever it is, it's beautiful.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's perfect.  Yeah, the animation too. 
[00:14:30]  It is really, really perfect.  Drinking out of cups.  Drinking out of cups.  Fucking stay...  What was it?  The walk-in?  Oh, that's my favorite part.  That is the favorite part.  I got to memorize that part.  Leading me into the building.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  That's where the fuck you comes from.  Dude, how did the watchman call it?  How many more did Land of the Lost make?  Stay right there, man.  The third one down.  Yeah, how much did Land of the Lost make?  Oh, I thought it was athletic supporters.  No, that's not it. 
[00:15:00]  That's in response too.  I hate those.  No, it's not what I thought.  Did you hit the third one down?  Yeah, that one right there.  Oh, you did?  All right, I'm sorry.  What?  Maybe it's that one?  Maybe it is.  Mm-hmm.  What does this guy think is an Indian?  An Indian.  What is he, a goddamn asshole?  What the fuck is he doing?  Not ever.  No way.  I love this guy.  Not ever.  Now he's Johnny Hammersticks.  Hammering away like he's friggin' Tommy Noble. 
[00:15:30]  What the hell is he doing?  Think she's, think she's got it going bossing over.  No way.  No way.  What is this garbage?  What is this?  Oh, I'm king of the trees.  I'm the tree meister.  I count on them.  Well, sometimes I pry.  I like to stealst.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right.  This guy's a faggot.  This guy's some sort of faggot Indian in the teepee. 
[00:16:00]  This guy thinks he's Captain Knots.  Thinks he's Captain Tying Knots.  When everyone needs some knots tied, they go to him.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  This woman's such a bitch.  Thinks he's Miss Sand.  Drinking out of cups.  Cups.  Being a bitch.  I bet her fist.  I bet her feralisk.  Barned.  Pat her skunk.  Pat her little kid in the background.  Fucking going crazy. 
[00:16:30]  Who's this guy?  Mr. Balloons.  Mr. Balloon Hands.  No way.  No way.  Get real.  Like those things.  Mr. Walkway.  Mr. Walk down me.  I'm the walkway.  Lead me to the building.  Fuck you.  Just try to help.  6-4-3.  Yeah, right.  You're some stupid bitch.  Who paid for that floor?  Not me.  No way.  Never be able to no floor ever again.  Not once.  Not never. 
[00:17:00]  Nope.  Whose chair's that?  Who bought that goddamn chair here?  That's not my chair.  Not my chair, not my problem.  That's what I say.  No way.  Stupid dresses.  Stupid flowers.  Lighthouses rule.  You don't like the lighthouse?  You suck.  What is this?  Seahorse captain?  Captain.  What?  Is this a seahorse seashell party?  Who didn't invite me?  Why didn't I get invited?  Seahorse sea hell?  What is this?  Get real. 
[00:17:30]  I'm in love with seahorses.  I'm in love with them.  They're so beautiful and cute.  I'm in love with the seahorses.  They're fucking unreal.  I love them.  They're like all the clocks.  I love them.  I love seahorses.  And I love looking at them.  And I love seashells.  I love seashell things.  I love things with seashells and seahorses on them.  Like blankets and towels and little bags.  I love them.  Seahorses.  Forever.  Forever.  Forever.  It sounds like he is probably in the closet seeing things, but it sounds like he's loving 
[00:18:00]  the way the words feel coming out.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Like this certain way he's speaking.  It just probably feels right.  It's the walkway.  Weird mouth.  No way.  Leading me toward the building.  Not once.  Fuck you.  Not never.  My favorite new part?  Little kid going crazy.  Going crazy.  Who bought that floor?  I like the words he makes up right before little kid's going crazy.  Yeah, he's just babbling words.  Sklarin.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  No way.  Drinking out of cups on YouTube.  I think we're a little late to that party, but it's still fine, man.  Oh, come on.  We'll play that one every day for the next two weeks, and it'll still be good.  So Up is your number one movie at the box office.  Old guy.  What?  Boy Scouts?  Cub Scouts or something?  Stuck in his house?  Yeah, right.  With balloons.  Balloon hands.  Balloon hands.  A lot of balloon hands.  And, yeah, we said The Hangover's the movie to watch, obviously.  Yeah.  And then Night at the Museum and Star Trek. 
[00:19:00]  Star Trek's still doing well.  Still cranking it out.  What's the grand total on Star Trek?  God, I don't know.  222?  222, huh?  222 so far.  I guess they're going to have to make a sequel, huh?  I think they were working on it already.  Or another prequel or whatever the hell they want to call them.  Yeah.  So there you go.  In that franchise.  Land of the Lost, by the way, $19.5 million, but they're calling that a bomb.  They were hoping for a lot more on that movie.  Unless you're making fucking $35 million, $40 million, you're done.  That's $10 million is just because it's Will Ferrell. 
[00:19:30]  Like, there are people who just go see anything he does, and that's where $10 million of that comes from.  Got to give props to Will Ferrell.  I'm sure a lot of people have seen it by now, but him doing Man vs. Wild with Bear Grylls.  Anyone watch that yet?  Really?  No.  Oh, it's pretty good.  They got all the parts on YouTube.  Go one.  Yeah.  But Will Ferrell can't even climb a tree.  Really?  Like, Bear Grylls has to kind of climb a tree to figure out what direction they're going to go in.  Will Ferrell doesn't seem like he's in very good shape.  Yeah, but climbing a tree? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, it's just something you always do.  I think Bear Grylls was looking at him like, what the fuck did I get myself into?  The guy can't even do something that every little kid could do.  You could still climb a tree if you had to, right?  Yeah.  That's what I thought.  Get up there.  Yeah.  Pull myself up.  Yeah, bro.  Tree Meister.  Trees.  Climate trees.  Me?  No way.  Uh-uh.  Not once.  Not never.  And then he counts numbers and says, no.  Three, two, one.  No fucking way.  No way. 
[00:20:30]  But it has to be that way.  Bullshit.  But there's no other way to look at that.  No.  He's fucked up.  Hey, yeah.  NBA Finals, huh?  Huh?  Come on.  You watched, right?  You watched?  Here's what I heard.  Oh, of course.  Here's what I heard on the way in.  Something about Game 2.  Something about Game 2.  Good.  And I'm like...  Good.  No, all I said was, what?  Game 2?  Yeah.  I thought they were done with this already.  No, it'll...  Enough!  It'll hit...  It'll hit...  Excuse me. 
[00:21:00]  Seven?  It'll hit middle of June by the time this is over.  I am so fucking sick of basketball playoffs.  They go way too long.  And you know that basketball...  Way too fucking long.  And basketball starts up in October.  Yeah.  So these guys who are still in it...  You know, there are teams that ended...  Stopped playing a month and a half ago, I think.  Two months ago, maybe, at this point.  It's ludicrous how long fucking basketball goes.  It's ludicrous how all sports go, except for football.  Football's pretty quick, yeah.  And this, you know, in day and age... 
[00:21:30]  Uh-huh.  It's crazy how long these seasons are.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, everyone's like, you know...  Attention span is getting smaller and smaller.  It's ridiculous.  Shorter and shorter, I should say.  Well, the Lakers won in overtime.  Oh, the Lakers won?  101 to 96.  I couldn't stay up.  I tried.  Yeah, I couldn't either.  I was trying to watch the game.  Yeah, right.  And, uh...  Wow.  Yeah, but see, like, you love stuff.  I love stuff.  I know.  Jimmy loves stuff. 
[00:22:00]  It's just it.  You like the basketball.  Uh...  And drinking from kegs.  Kegs.  Drinking from kegs.  The keg man.  No way.  Uh-uh.  Who put this keg here?  Put this keg here.  Kegs.  Mr. Keg Hands.  How bad do you want to just make your own?  I know.  You couldn't possibly have that delivery, though.  No.  That is too natural.  Yeah.  A perfectly natural delivery.  No, I just, uh...  Sat at home because it was, um...  Why don't you like basketball?  For real.  Um...  I've said it before. 
[00:22:30]  You can't have a...  The whole gist of watching a sport  is to watch your team score  and go,  holy shit!  Because it's a rare thing.  It should be a rare thing  that your team scores  and you go, yes!  But you don't want it as rare as soccer.  No, no, no.  Soccer's annoying.  Soccer's the other end of the spectrum  where you're like,  this sucks because no one's fucking scoring  the whole time.  We just mentioned soccer.  Now watch them come out of the window.  You don't understand.  Shut up.  All right.  I get it.  Any sport where they can go to a commercial 
[00:23:00]  while they're still playing,  is it worth watching, really?  Tie a Brazilian flex to your hood  and like soccer.  They're even admitting that this game is boring.  We're going to go and pay some bills.  Don't worry.  You're not going to miss anything.  And they go back.  It's still 0-0.  No way.  The field is way too big.  Yeah.  You should be able to get the whole field  in one camera angle.  Yeah.  How about that?  Pop it in there.  One camera should be able to cover the field.  How about that?  But basketball,  they score too much  for it to be exciting. 
[00:23:30]  When you're watching football  and you've got a five-yard line  fucking drive into the end zone like that,  you're up edge of your seat.  You're going,  come on.  Get the fuck in there.  Right.  And basketball,  dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk,  two points.  Dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk,  funk, two points.  Dunk, dunk, dunk.  And all right,  I'll give them the last couple of minutes.  I know it's cliche,  but I'll give them the last couple of minutes  during a tight game.  A lot of fouling going on.  You know,  that's very important. 
[00:24:00]  Get the guy up at the line.  Try to get that.  Whatever.  But the whole thought,  why am I going to watch  from the first fucking quarter,  from the first fucking tip-off,  I'm going to sit there and go,  oh, yeah, he scored!  It's boring to me.  Imagine if you had a react like that  every time your team scored.  Every time.  You would be exhausted.  Holy shit.  And then the other team scores.  God damn it!  Damn it!  You get all mad.  It's like,  oh, don't worry,  there's a hundred more of those to go. 
[00:24:30]  And then ten seconds later,  your team scores again.  Yeah.  Yes!  But it's just...  Imagine you didn't really know the sport  and you're watching it for the first time.  Thinking,  wow, he did it.  You know,  I think you're right.  It just,  to me,  the whole thing...  I would like to defend that,  but the older I get,  I think you're starting to be right  about basketball.  It's the whole thing.  So that's why I was never really able  to just get into it.  Do you know what I love to do  if I walk in and the score is like,  say,  10-6?  I love to just go,  is it the fourth quarter?  Yes.  This game's over.  And they never understand  that you're being sarcastic. 
[00:25:00]  Like,  nah, man,  I just started.  Like,  I know,  asshole.  Out of the four main...  Mr. Fucking Givens scores.  Out of the four main sports,  TV watching,  what order would you put them in?  TV watching,  you gotta put football first.  Football first.  You gotta put football...  It's such a fucking  brutally exciting game.  You get a good football game.  Man,  it's exciting to watch. 
[00:25:30]  You know what?  That's like,  it's like an army.  You fucking,  you know,  it's two teams  that are bashing each other's heads in  to get past them  to get that fucking ball over there.  And that is a good game.  And the soccer fans  will argue strategy.  I mean,  you can't argue strategy with football.  You see it.  You see it.  They're pushing up the field.  Oh,  they're short.  All right,  now I gotta figure out what to do.  All right,  now the other team's coming back  the other way.  I was gonna say hockey  to be different,  but you know what?  I think you're right,  Ant.  Football,  number one sport to watch on TV.  Third and long 
[00:26:00]  and they fucking go for that pass  and the guy keeps his toes in  the fucking end zone.  Whoa,  whoa.  The ballerina.  That shit's fantastic to watch.  Second sport.  Second sport to watch on television.  This might be an odd one,  but I'm going for hockey.  Very good.  That's what I say.  I'm going for hockey.  It's fast moving.  Very good.  Very fast moving.  Again,  if you get a good game,  tight game,  it's pretty exciting  watching,  you know,  power plays are great, 
[00:26:30]  watching the team  trying to fend off  the extra guy,  shit like that.  It's a lot of fun.  But then I gotta go  with baseball,  which is a little long-winded.  And it's,  you know,  even a good game,  it just,  it takes too fucking long.  I would go basketball,  baseball.  You're doing baseball,  basketball.  Baseball,  because there are those moments  in baseball  where it's like,  you're sitting there for a while,  base is loaded,  you know,  and the pitch,  and it's like,  okay,  tip,  the ball, 
[00:27:00]  another tip,  tip,  the guy's just sitting at the plate  and you're like,  come on,  what the fuck?  And then wham,  smashes it out of the park.  I'm looking for  exciting moments.  And those only come  at the end of the basketball games.  If some team is fucking,  you know,  in the shitter by two points  and some guy's able to break out  and sink that three-pointer,  that's exciting.  Well,  what's brilliant about sports,  they're starting to do  the fast version of games.  Like,  you'll watch a Yankee replay  or whatever,  or whatever your favorite team is.  I'm sure pretty much 
[00:27:30]  every city's doing this now.  You could watch like a Met game  or a Yankee game  within an hour and a half.  Yeah.  Or an hour.  I think it's an hour.  Which is,  have you checked this out?  No.  Like late night or something?  They do it late at night.  I forgot what they call it.  It's like Mets,  Mets fast forwarder,  or they come,  it's a clever name,  and you get to see your,  No way.  the latest game  within an hour.  Really?  And they should do  the same thing with basketball.  Do it like in a half hour.  Well,  you know what I like,  and do they use this tactic  in that,  in what you're talking about?  when they're showing 
[00:28:00]  the highlights  of the pitches  that are thrown against,  like sometimes the batter's  up there for fucking,  you know,  30 pitches.  Yeah,  but you know what?  And it's like,  whoosh,  whoosh,  on the news highlights,  they just show,  whoosh,  whoosh,  whoosh,  one after the other.  No,  they choose,  because sometimes  a guy at bat for a long time,  you know,  fouling off,  you know,  pitches and stuff,  that's,  no,  I think it's exciting.  Not every time,  but every once in a while  you do get one of those moments  where,  you know,  it's a nice struggle  between the batter  and the pitcher.  Yeah.  You know, 
[00:28:30]  so they have to choose those.  They don't do a lot of those.  Choose wisely.  Hockey's hard  if you don't know the sport,  though,  because you don't know  where the puck is  half the time.  I can't watch hockey  because all of a sudden  it's just like,  ah,  they don't score that often.  That little streak,  the little streak on the puck.  They tried that.  What was it?  That was when they were  going for a real slap shot.  Then it would turn red.  Didn't they get like  Steven Spielberg or somebody?  They got a big Hollywood director  Industrial Lights and Magic.  To try to figure out  how to make hockey  more interesting  to watch on TV.  I forgot who it was.  It might have been  Steven Spielberg, though. 
[00:29:00]  And they started  with the streak thing  which got way too distracting.  Yeah, yeah.  I think they just should change  the color of the puck.  Black is on the white, though.  It is black on white.  That's kind of...  But you make it like  fluorescent orange or something  and then, you know,  you know where the puck is  at all times.  But, you know,  purists will yell and scream  and, you know.  Throw a tantrum.  Plus, it's going so fast, dude.  No matter what color.  Even if you kind of  get the idea of where it is,  it's moving.  Well, that brings me  to the second part  of this question.  Now, do the four sports 
[00:29:30]  in order of...  Going.  Going to the game.  Because I do think  it's different.  All right.  You're absolutely right.  And it is very different  because, number one,  I'll put baseball.  To go to?  You know why?  It's just...  If you have a good...  You have good seats  and it's a nice day,  that adds to the whole thing.  You don't know...  If you're watching on TV,  that doesn't come  into consideration.  Yeah.  But when you're at the game  and it's a nice day,  you're hanging out,  drinking a few beers,  you're just watching,  you know, 
[00:30:00]  you're watching the game.  It's fun to be at.  I don't know  if you want to put it  good to be at live  to watch the game only  or to experience  the whole thing  of being at the game.  I would have to go hockey.  I don't know.  Hockey is exciting  to watch live, man.  Yeah, it is.  Holy shit.  It is.  But the thing is,  you're now, you know,  cooped up in an arena.  You're kind of...  Yeah, I understand.  I mean, there's  different philosophies here. 
[00:30:30]  There's a great feeling  about going to a ball game  in a nice park,  you know, good seats,  good weather.  Well, the reason I don't  put football up near the top  is because I never got  a good seat for a football game.  Fuck you.  Yeah, there's 8 billion people  in the stadium.  And I never could figure out  how to get a good seat  for a football game.  And another thing,  I've never been to a football game  where I wasn't freezing  my fucking cock off  and I cannot take  being freezing cold  like that.  I think my family,  we're down to,  like, two generations 
[00:31:00]  from now,  we'll finally get, like,  season tickets for the Jets.  So we're excited about that.  You're really on a waiting list?  My brother is.  He's been on a waiting list  for, like, 10 years.  And every year,  he, like, goes,  oh, I moved up  another seven slots.  So I guess his grandkids  will enjoy having season tickets  to, you know, the Jets.  I'd probably go baseball,  hockey, football, basketball.  And football,  the only reason  is because of the fucking weather.  Sucks an ass. 
[00:31:30]  And you never get a good seat.  You're always,  everyone on the field  is this little dot.  Right.  You can't see shit.  You don't know what's happening.  No.  The announcers make football  very, very exciting.  Yeah, you have to.  And the camera angles.  I mean, now,  with the cameras they got at home,  you might as well  just fucking be at home, dude.  Yeah, absolutely.  Nice, big screen,  high-def fucking television  watching a football game like that  is better than being at the game.  Football's amazing live, though, man.  It's like sometimes  you don't know what happened,  but just when you see  a bomb pass getting thrown, 
[00:32:00]  or when you see a guy  break it out of the pack,  it's like baseball I love,  but it's every pitch,  the foul balls.  Bum, bum, ba-da,  bum, bum, ba-da,  bum, ba-da,  bum, ba-da,  bum, ba-da,  bum, ba-da,  the music.  Da-da-da, da-da,  and then one guy  Charge!  Yeah, hot dogs,  hot dogs,  it's constant noise.  It is constant noise.  There's not a moment  of silence.  Shut up for one goddamn moment. 
[00:32:30]  For one second.  It's true.  Can I not be stimulated?  Good.  And ladies and gentlemen,  I'd like to take  this opportunity  to welcome  the Westchester  Weeblos.  The Weeblos  are here today.  The Boy Scouts  of America.  And now  it's time  for the 7th Street.  Mar-na-na-na-  Cotton-eyed Joe,  Mar-na-na-na-  Cotton-eyed Joe.  Ugh!  Terrible.  And now  YMC Air  has the 
[00:33:00]  Grounds crew  take the  They still don't  edit the  Yes, I believe so.  That's tradition.  It's all noise.  My list would be hockey, football, basketball, baseball.  Wow, baseball last over basketball.  Here's basketball.  Just sneakers fucking making that sound on the floor. 
[00:33:30]  I grew up playing basketball, but it's moving down the list every year.  It really is.  I think I'm going to put that number one for a while.  Ate it.  Now it's in third place with the big four.  Did I put women's gymnastics down there?  Oh, good God.  Or, you know what?  Women's tennis if that 17-year-old tit monster is playing.  The big tit monster tennis player, of course.  Hope she didn't have those lopped off yet.  And for you golf fans, Tiger Woods, just an amazing round yesterday,  and he wins the Memorial Cup. 
[00:34:00]  After shooting 74 in the second round, which is pretty much you shoot a 74  in a PGA tournament, you know, kiss your chances of winning goodbye.  You're done.  He turns around and shoots a 65 yesterday.  He's amazing.  Two birdies to end it.  He's going out on a limb saying that?  Yeah, good input.  Not as amazing because he's still kind of coming back from that.  Yeah, from the injury.  Massive knee surgery.  Which is hysterical.  Reconstructive knee surgery.  The fuck is this?  Uh-oh.  What do we got?  What is that?  Get the fuck out of here.  No way, no how. 
[00:34:30]  Uh-uh.  No way, no how.  Bullshit.  Topless gymnast.  Steve C.  Topless gymnast.  No way, no how.  On the fucking balance beam.  Stop it.  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  Fuck you.  No way.  2D cups.  2D cups.  Wow, that's pretty sweet.  All right.  This is so hot.  It's a gymnast.  It's a bow topless wearing a thong on the balance beam.  Wow, what boobs.  With great natural tits.  She's wonderful.  What is this about, Steve?  I started seeing these clips a couple years ago. 
[00:35:00]  These Russian chicks were really good.  And this pesky one got in the way.  You know what I love about it?  She's a Russian broad.  Yeah, of course she is.  You know what I love about the Russian broad who just has an amazing body?  You know she wanted to be an Olympic champion.  I want to know when she finally said, ah, fuck my dream.  When those tits got too big.  You can't be a gymnast with those tits.  Fuck my dream.  I'm now going to do this nude for everybody so guys could jerk off somewhere.  It works.  It's fantastic.  How did they get to this, Steve?  They're clamoring out there.  Clamoring.  Meta Cafe and just search on topless gymnast. 
[00:35:30]  Meta Cafe.  Yeah.  If you just Google topless gymnast, it's one of the top links, actually.  Oh, nice dismount.  And she puts her hands up.  Those beautiful natural breast disease.  She's wearing a thong.  Look at that ass.  She's got to do the Ogre Corbett, though.  Oh, where she does that.  Remember the Ogre?  Wasn't that one of the clips that started off Wide World of Sports?  Wide World of Sports.  With Ogre Corbett pretty much eating her own box?  Yeah.  Find that for Jimmy.  Too bad she was ugly.  She was laying down. 
[00:36:00]  She had her chin.  On her chest and chin on the balance beam.  And the rest of her body was slung over her fucking head.  So wait, she officially would be eating her own asshole.  Eating her ass.  Something.  They're close enough where she could get to eat the one.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Look at the fucking...  Do you know what I was...  Sometimes I was trying to watch something this weekend.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Nice clothes up.  She's doing a handstand with her vag.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Bulging in her little bikini bottoms and her big boobs.  I don't know if they're real, though.  How would you like to... 
[00:36:30]  They look very natural.  Yeah, they do.  All right.  They look very natural.  How would you like to just run by that balance beam with your tongue out and just lick the  top of it when she's finished?  I'm probably thinking of other things rather dope.  But fantastic.  Well, if you couldn't, you know...  Why would you want to do that?  I don't know.  Fucking licking balance beams.  She's not the only one who uses it, Ant.  Right?  You know there was a sweaty guy working on his routine, too.  I think that guys don't use that thing.  They don't, right?  Okay.  I've never seen one.  I don't know.  I was on...  Someone is saying, check out her floor exercise, and it's in capital letters, so it's got to 
[00:37:00]  be terrific.  What?  She does all the events?  Topless?  I've seen this one, and I've seen one with her on the...  What's it called?  The parallel bars?  Yeah.  Let me see if I can find it.  Wow.  Yeah.  Very nice.  And she's an average-looking girl.  No, she's got a really nice body.  She's doing...  Nice boobs.  She's doing gymnastics naked.  That's hot.  And Roger Federer wins the French Open.  Roger Federer.  Do you ever watch men's tennis or women's tennis? 
[00:37:30]  No.  Not really, right?  I'm one of those...  I'll go to the U.S. Open every year, though, because that's a nice event to go to.  Yeah.  Walk around and stuff.  Nice day out there.  It used to be Forest Hills.  Oh.  The tennis center.  Yeah.  They don't do it out there anymore?  What?  Well, I mean, they moved...  They moved it?  They moved the stadium right next to, you know, where Shea Stadium is, Citi Field.  Kind of right next to it, sort of, there.  Ties Pete Sampras' record with 14 major titles, so that's a big deal in the tennis world this morning. 
[00:38:00]  Did someone come running out and grab him or some shit?  Yeah, I thought it was hilarious.  Why do we have to take that so seriously?  The guy was just having fun.  Well, maybe because when it happened once, a woman got stabbed.  Monica Sellers.  Yeah.  Good point.  Good point.  Maybe that's why.  I love how you can shut me down so quickly.  A little tense about it.  I just decided to spend the weekend...  Well, you know, it was the anniversary of D-Day.  Yes.  So there were a lot of cool things on the History Channel and the Military Channel.  So I was just watching that. 
[00:38:30]  Hitler lost again every time I watch it.  What was his overall record?  I think he was 0 for 1.  In the end, he was 0 for 1.  0 for 1.  Unless you count his experience in World War I, which pretty much was a tie.  I don't think they really lost that one.  Kind of set him up.  Set him up well for World War II.  But, oh, there's Olga.  Little Olga Korbutt. 
[00:39:00]  She was butt ugly.  But she was a little sweetheart back then.  Everyone loved her.  She was ugly.  And you knew those chicks just, they do not age well.  Well, they gave her ponytails to try to make her look cute.  Yeah.  And it just never worked.  But she was just one of those little impish things that I think people enjoy.  And Nadia Koenich wasn't much better.  No.  And I had a crush on her when I was growing up.  And they'd grow up.  And then I'd like...  Look at her.  She's like a rubber band.  Yeah.  I looked back at what she looked like and I said, what was, you know, what is wrong with  you?  Why would you have a crush on Nadia Koenich out of all the women you could pick? 
[00:39:30]  But you watch some of these older balance beam things.  And they're a lot different than now.  I mean, they're doing fucking backflips on these things.  Now?  We're back there.  Now.  There, she's just rubber girl.  She's just kind of...  Yeah.  What year is this, you think?  80s?  72.  72.  Yeah, I'd go early 70s.  Absolutely.  Who did you watch on the History Channel this weekend?  Hitler.  Speaking of Hitler.  Yes.  Huh?  I was trying to watch... 
[00:40:00]  The movie Downfall is a great portrayal of Hitler.  The guy's acting is...  And there's a scene where he's yelling at his generals.  And I'm like, that's what it was like to be yelled at by Hitler.  Yeah.  The acting was so...  It's probably the best acted thing I've ever seen anybody do.  Yeah.  So I went to watch it on YouTube and there's over a hundred versions of it.  And every one of them is fucking subtitled with some stupid goof.  It's like...  Oh, no.  Really?  Yeah, really?  I saw the one where he's arguing about his Xbox. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  It's really...  And one of them is, I want to see Fedor fight in the UFC.  He's speaking German, so whatever's written down there, you know.  Every one of them is ridiculous.  This morning at 3 a.m., Microsoft started to scan for Modify.  Yeah, there it is.  It really is a great movie, by the way.  It is a good movie.  You got it.  Just get it on fucking Blu-ray and enjoy.  Is that a good Hitler? 
[00:41:00]  Dude, just because you put the mustache on doesn't mean it's a good Hitler.  What's his name?  Hugo Gans?  That's not him.  Steiner konnte nicht genügen kräfte für einen Angriff.  Here's the generals telling him the bad news.  Hugo Steiner ist nicht erfolgt.  Yeah, the war is lost, basically, I think, right?  Unless Hitler...  He doesn't look pleased?  No, he's not happy.  Hitler, at the end of his term there, is shaking.  Takes his glasses off and addresses his generals.  He boots everybody out except for the four. 
[00:41:30]  Except for his generals.  Who are not going to be talked to kindly.  Who are now looking at each other like, oh, oh boy, this ain't good.  Is this the little wisp of hair he has?  How the fuck could this have happened?  It's a sub-final.  Why was I not informed sooner?  They're all listening through the door like, oh boy, there's Elder Bay. 
[00:42:00]  How dare they ban my console?  I don't want...  2,000 Microsoft points.  I bought a Call of Duty theme pack.  He even used arcade games from time to time.  Listen to his voice, though.  It's...  Throws his pens at the map. 
[00:42:30]  Rocky Dennis was happier looking at the map than he is right now.  But that's exactly what it must have been like to be yelled at by that fucking lunatic.  To be yelled at?  Oh, here comes Ava.  She's going to calm him down.  Watch his little hands.  Who knows what to do with his hands, huh?  Dude, this guy is...  It's the best thing I've ever seen anybody do as an actor.  Jim Norton as Adolf Hitler.  His hands are in his pockets, yeah. 
[00:43:00]  Ted Hitler.  I don't even dislike you.  I don't want to kill anybody.  Yeah, he did an amazing...  Bruno Gans, that was his name.  Bruno Gans.  He did an amazing fucking job as Hitler.  One of the best Hitlers I've ever seen in a movie.  You've seen a lot of them, too.  Oh, I've seen them all.  Who was the worst Hitler?  Worst Hitler ever?  John Amos.  I was running through my head looking for Dick Van Dyke or something. 
[00:43:30]  He kept calling Stalin Jr.  People are like, this is not true.  Yeah, he did a great job.  The story was great, too.  It was just, you know, instead of this weird kind of cliched version of the bunker in the last couple of days of Hitler being in the bunker,  they really took that kind of gritty, realistic take on it.  And that scene where Goebbels and his kids and his wife, you know, they don't want to live without their Fuhrer and without the Reich. 
[00:44:00]  And, oh, they pull some shenanigans.  Holy shit.  Just fucking unbelievable scene.  And people were outraged by this movie because it showed Hitler as a regular man.  As a human being and not the monster that...  Well, unfortunately, he was a human being, albeit a crazy one.  But that makes it scarier because the Nazis were not these robots from outer space.  They were fucking people who, you know, just became these monstrous barbarians. 
[00:44:30]  It's scarier to think that, like, a guy who you can relate to on some level is capable of that.  Yep.  Just, you know, he loves his dog.  Hitler, I was reading recently, he was a vegetarian and he did not like eating meat because the methods of killing animals was far too cruel.  Yeah, yeah.  And he hated smoking.  He thought it was very rude to ruin someone's air with cigarette smoke.  He was like a fucking...  He had no problem ruining a lot of people's air, though.  Of course that would cycle on B.  What a whack job.  When the announcement came out that Hitler was dead, they all pulled cigarettes out in the bunker and just put them in their mouth and light up and just all started smoking. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Great movie.  Downfall.  Someone is saying the Downfall mashups on YouTube are terrific.  Yeah, there's a bunch of them.  Oh, so you've seen all this stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, and our pal Ed Asner is a star of Up, and this caller wants to know why we can't get Ed Asner on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  You know, I never had a bad experience on this program with Ed Asner.  I don't understand.  Technically, that's a true statement.  Yes.  Yay. 
[00:45:30]  It was me, Rogan.  Jimmy, you were there, right?  He hugged me and kissed me on the cheek.  Of course.  Man loved me.  Jimmy was the problem that day.  And Voss.  I certainly wasn't.  You were the destroyer.  I called you the destroyer.  It was me, Voss, Rogan, and Jimmy having a nice time with Ed Asner.  What's the problem?  Nice time.  Obviously, I'm setting up the Ed Asner clip, if you got it, Travis.  I don't know.  I don't think Travis has it.  He's a big star.  He's a big star.  The movie's number one at the box office for two weeks in a row, so.  He's got a hit on his hands.  Want to go to break with the Ed Asner thing? 
[00:46:00]  Sure.  A couple minutes long?  Who cares?  We've got two minutes.  No way, no how.  Yes, I say way.  Bridge to break.  Ed Asner.  Yeah.  Cartoon.  Leading us to break.  No way.  Fuck you.  No way.  Maritala Mohan.  Come on.  Ted Nightenday.  John Amos.  Played Gordy.  You think with the listeners, we could have a little contest, come up with a new one?  I don't know.  It's hard to do, man.  If you keep it short, we could play a few of them.  That is hard to do.  Just lock yourself in a closet, take some drugs, and see what happens. 
[00:46:30]  You know what?  Maybe the bit is.  Maybe.  I mean, not all these bits are going to fly.  We understand that.  But you've got to throw them out there and see what sticks.  Maybe if the listeners come up with a drinking out of cups.  Drinking out of cups.  The O&A version.  So they use the O&A characters.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Ted.  Sheckler.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  No way.  No how, inventor.  Stop it.  And you've got Big A, and Pat from Menaki, and Stalker Patty, all the peeps. 
[00:47:00]  There kind of are a lot of things you could work into there.  I'll just throw it out there.  If it works and we get a good one, maybe it'll motivate others to do them.  Or maybe we should try one.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  No way.  Too busy.  I'm playful.  Love that, man.  It's hysterical.  All right.  Ed Asner, as we go to break.  Ed Asner.  Opinance.  Hello.  $1,200 a month.  Electric bill. 
[00:47:30]  That's what I'm rolling.  Wow.  And the summer hasn't even really started yet.  No way.  No way.  What is this garbage?  Really?  $1,200?  $1,200 was my electric bill this month.  Not me.  No way.  Not once.  Not never.  Well, you may be not.  I bet her fist.  I bet her fiddlesque.  Barned.  Pat her skoom.  Pat her little kid in the background fucking going crazy.  Barned. 
[00:48:00]  Please play that one more time.  I bet her fist.  I bet her fiddlesque.  Barned.  Pat her skoom.  Pat her little kid in the background fucking going crazy.  I want to learn that whole fucking line.  I want to learn every bit of gibberish she's saying there.  If you can spell that made up word, I will follow you on Twitter.  I'll follow you on Twitter.  That is a good one.  I bet her fist.  I bet her fiddlesque.  Barned.  Pat her skoom.  Pat her little kid in the background fucking going crazy.  Crazy. 
[00:48:30]  Something fist.  I think he's saying fist and then he goes and fiddlesque.  Fiddlesque.  Fiddlesque.  That just felt good for learn.  Yeah.  That's why Spanish was fun.  It just felt good to speak Spanish.  Speak Spanish.  When you get to roll stuff.  Feels good.  Feels good.  Yeah, I think the pool pump running always got the electric bill up.  But ever since I got that bill over the weekend, I've turned into Mr. Light Switch guy now. 
[00:49:00]  Now I'm trying to like...  Because I would go to bed and realize, like I'm upstairs in the bedroom shutting the big doors, my big vault, my bedroom vault.  And I'd look and go, I left like about 15 lights on downstairs.  And then I'm going, ah, screw it, I'll turn off tomorrow.  And then the basement now, which is now a whole sporting complex and studio and movie theater and bar. 
[00:49:30]  I wouldn't know.  Has like an open invite.  Oh yeah, I forgot.  Pat Fumonaki was over.  I know.  Trust me, I know.  I keep tabs.  Opie, how about this weekend coming?  A lot of hi-hats.  Anthony, I don't know if you're around, but how about this weekend coming?  Yes.  We go to Anthony's house.  I'll bring my DVD copy of Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park.  Oh, watch it in the theater.  We'll watch it in the theater.  We'll all have popcorn.  We'll all sing along.  It'll be wonderful.  Of course it will.  Yes.  See? 
[00:50:00]  Can we have a booze-free weekend with you?  You can.  I actually drank on Saturday.  I had one.  My God, man.  I had one half of a tap Bud Light yesterday.  Really?  I poured it.  I was drinking it.  I'm just like, you know something?  I just had my fill over the weekend.  I drank my ass off.  I was done full up.  Saturday I drank more than I have in a long time.  Were you drunk?  Oh yeah.  I don't have ever seen you drunk.  Oh yeah.  And then I woke up yesterday, played golf, hungover, 90 degrees. 
[00:50:30]  Play golf.  It's the ball hand.  Yeah?  It's a little rough to be on a golf course when you're a little hungover.  Hungover?  Oh my God.  Sweat it out.  Forget it.  What?  Did they tell you?  No way.  No way.  What is this?  Garbage.  Yeah.  Exactly.  You got to sweat it out.  Hell no.  Garbage.  Yeah.  I think it's the pool pump running like crazy.  Like crazy, Jerry.  And then, speaking of the pool, I'm supposed to have some supplemental electric heater going 
[00:51:00]  in, which is just going to pump that electric bill way up.  But in the meantime, I have the propane heater, but it goes through a lot of propane.  I don't have natural gas in my neighborhood, which sucks.  Yeah.  That doesn't sound like it would be efficient.  Well, it makes believing.  Jimmy will beg to differ, but it does make it very fucking hot.  Yeah, but how many oil tankers are coming by your house?  It would be crazy.  It's like a...  Going crazy.  It's like a...  But it's a buried submarine, pretty much, in my backyard.  Oh, really?  If it ever went up, it would take out like 12 blocks. 
[00:51:30]  But it heats very...  It makes it very hot.  And I don't have to leave it burning that long.  You like a hot pool in the summer, too?  No, the jacuzzi.  Oh, okay.  Well, you're heating your pool, though, too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I want my pool heated a little bit.  But how much, though?  Just to tie it into the 80s?  80s?  In the summer?  Bring it into the 80s in the summer.  I don't want...  Especially if you're in the jacuzzi.  I don't want to jump into a cold pool.  I don't like cold.  I like just drifting around, feeling like I'm in the womb.  So, they're installing this heater, this electric heater, and Keith is over, supervising. 
[00:52:00]  I wasn't there yet.  And Keith's like, I just started hearing...  Oh, shit.  And then apparently they ran to their van like the little rascals and just took off.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  No.  So, Keith comes back, yeah.  Keith comes back, and it seems one of the gentlemen took a sawzall, and the blade, as he was cutting something to install the big PVC pipe in, 
[00:52:30]  went right into the coil of the heater, because it's a heat pump.  Works like an air conditioner, only backwards.  That's how they work.  And hit the refrigerant line.  Oh, shit.  All the refrigerant is just coming out.  And I'm told this, and we talked to the guy that owns the place that's installing this.  I go, listen, I don't want to see some guy here with a torch and his little fucking soldering thing and his flux and everything else. 
[00:53:00]  I want that taken out, and I want a new one put the fuck in.  It's been a catastrophe.  Yeah, why are you having so many problems?  Because people are incompetent.  Are they partaking in the Guinness and the Bud Light before they do work around your house?  No, I lock that bar up.  Good for you.  I can't tell you the anguish that this pool is putting me through.  The equipment works.  It's great.  It has nothing to do with the equipment or anything. 
[00:53:30]  It's the people that have to come over to do things.  Why do they?  And it's crazy.  When do they make pooling so complicated?  Pooling.  Oh, pooling.  I know.  Let's call it pooling.  Well, the whole thing is.  You got to think, when they started putting pools in, it was just like a hole would throw  some water in it.  Well, yeah.  Now it's a whole thing.  Now I got a remote control.  For your pool?  For my pool.  It's a remote control.  What the fuck's wrong with us?  Remember when people had to go over back by the pumps and the filter and everything and 
[00:54:00]  turn valves?  Now I press buttons, and the valves turn, and then I have the little waterfall that comes  out of the jacuzzi into the pool.  You could do that all with a remote?  Yeah, with a remote.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  And then I have the jets that come out, and then I could get the bubbles.  So if you're sitting in the jacuzzi, you don't have to get up and turn valves to make the  big bubbles come up and make it hotter or something.  You do it all with a remote.  You're getting a lot more for your money than I am.  Holy crap.  Well, I'm spending a lot of money.  No, you know.  Anthony has $9 in the bank. 
[00:54:30]  It's not fucked in that interest.  It doesn't seem like it, but I've spent my money.  It's just different when you live in New York City.  It's different in these suboibs.  When you're getting what I'm getting for the same money?  Oh.  But now my electric bill, like I said, $1,200 for the month.  And I believe what that is, is lighting.  I believe it's lighting for a certain thing that I like doing after work.  Yeah.  That I can't talk about.  Ixnay.  Believe me, Ixnay.  Everyone knows.  There's a lot of stuff that enhances the experience. 
[00:55:00]  Whatever.  We got to teach these guys.  I know.  That's what I'm thinking.  They do have to learn, but they never will.  I think they need to get their learn on.  Dogs are too old.  New tricks.  You think?  I think they can be learned.  Old dogs.  Ain't going to happen.  No way.  No how.  No way.  No way.  This is garbage.  Give them a bone.  Ain't going to happen.  Not me.  No way.  Not once.  Not never.  Fucking put a biscuit on his nose.  Uh-uh.  But they're dealing with a radio show that's very unique and different than every other radio show in  this facility.  We really continue the experience long after the show's over. 
[00:55:30]  The show technically never ends.  Right.  There is something going on, whether it's the twittering going on, whether it's some type  of presence we have on the web, whether it's more extravagant or less extravagant.  We do have a web presence, and that goes on all the time.  But they can't pie chart it.  That's what scares them.  If they could pie chart it, then they would go, yeah, yeah, do your podcast.  Yeah, keep the twittering going. 
[00:56:00]  You know, it's one of those things.  But I think the lighting itself is what is really spinning that meter.  Because it's, you know, it's a couple of thousand watts, I think.  And the room itself gets blazing hot after a while.  And I really think that's kind of been what's taken up a lot of the electricity.  But didn't your mom yell and scream at you your entire existence, turn off the lights?  Yeah.  Because that's why I don't do it.  Now that I'm an older guy, I walk around my place turning lights off all the time.  And, you know, I'm lucky enough to be able to keep all the lights on 24 hours a day. 
[00:56:30]  But it's still ingrained in my stupid head.  See, I'm doing it now.  So I walk around.  Ever since I got that bill, now I'm doing it just to see if it's more, it's kind of an experiment.  I want to see if it's so much the lights I have on.  And now what I do when I leave in the morning, I turn the TV off in my bedroom.  I used to leave that thing on constantly.  So I'd come home to the sounds of the television.  The sounds of humans.  Of somebody in the house, even if it's just a machine. 
[00:57:00]  It's a machine.  Why don't you get little Japanese robots to say, hello, Anthony.  We're happy you're here.  That's what I need.  Hey, do we have an update on the neighbors?  How much do they hate you these days?  Are they reaching out?  Are they doing anything?  Oh, I had contact with my other neighbor.  Which side?  Looking at the house.  Looking at the house on the street.  Left side neighbor.  But he's the one that doesn't like you.  No, no.  Right side neighbor is...  No, left side neighbor was the guy that came over with the cake and all that?  No, no, no.  Yeah, that's right side neighbor.  Right side neighbor did all that? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Left side neighbor, I barely see.  Okay.  But right side neighbor gave up on you after the whole cake and stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right side neighbor gave up on me.  And hasn't talked to you since?  I haven't seen him.  I haven't seen him.  They must hate you.  They must.  Just because you're very different than every other house in that neighborhood.  So I get a little...  Doorbell?  Well, yeah.  Well, I see you're looking for it.  I think we could just say doorbell.  Okay.  Ding dong.  I get a little doorbell and it's, you know, I'm still in bed. 
[00:58:00]  So I just throw on yesterday's clothes and run downstairs.  And I'm like, hello?  He goes, hi, I'm your neighbor over here.  He goes, my son's toy is in your yard.  So I'm like, oh, okay.  And I'm thinking it's a basketball or something.  He goes, it's a little mechanical flying bird.  It's a call, right?  You're going to be retrieving that.  I'll look for it.  I know.  You're going to be retrieving that twice a week, my friend.  That's all I'm thinking.  Little kid trying to fly his...  When I looked at it, you ever see those things?  They're the little birds that go... 
[00:58:30]  They're made out of very lightweight plastic wings.  Very thin, like, film almost.  I've never seen these.  And you wind them up and you throw it and it goes...  And it flaps and flies like a little bird.  But you don't know where it's going.  Apparently it goes into my yard like every other bird.  It's kind of like letting a balloon loose.  Yeah.  Where the fuck is that thing going?  Balloon hands.  So it ended up...  Balloon hands.  Balloon hands.  So I got it and I kind of threw it over the fence at him.  And he goes, oh, by the way, my name...  You know, he gave his name.  And then I said, oh, I'm...  I can say Anthony. 
[00:59:00]  People know my name's Anthony.  Why did I stop saying my name?  You should have said, I'm Anthony and I got hot chicks over here all the time.  So, you know, maybe make an excuse and come on over and hang with me.  I mean, one of his upstairs windows overlooked the yard.  I can't quite block it.  I need the fucking elm tree.  Don't ever block it.  To block it out.  But I think occasionally I see the blind open up.  Yeah, don't ever block it.  I'm not sure.  Because he'll always be on your side.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  When the shit goes down in the neighborhood, you can count on the guy that you've been allowing  to take a peek at Young Snatch in the pool. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Well, I retrieved it and threw it back over the fence.  I keep my gates locked.  Of course you do.  The last thing I need is some kid going back there looking for a toy and, you know, having  a Tommy Lee or a fucking Bud Abbott or Luke Costello or something.  Well, drinking out of cups, we got it transcribed here.  And that this line...  I bet a fist.  I bet a fetalisk.  Barned.  Patters come pat a little kid in the background fucking going crazy. 
[01:00:00]  I don't know if the translation's right up.  Well, it says, how about a fist?  I thought it said, how about a...  How about a fist?  How about a fetalisk?  I bet a have fist.  Oh, really?  How about a fetalisk, T-Barned.  T-Barned.  Patters come pat a little kid in the background fucking going crazy.  I don't know if that's right.  Let me hear it one more time while I read along.  I bet a fist.  I bet a fetalisk.  Barned.  Patters come pat a little kid in the background fucking going crazy. 
[01:00:30]  I think it's I better have fist.  Not how about a fist.  I bet a fist.  I bet a fetalisk to Barned.  What a great feeling.  Like your brain is just misfiring and then all of a sudden it goes back on track.  And then he's got a nice thought there.  I'm the king of the trees.  Fucking going crazy.  I'm the tree meister.  I count on him.  Tree meister.  Tree meister.  He's the best.  What else is going on in the world? 
[01:01:00]  In the world.  God, we had such a busy show Friday.  This story is kind of getting old.  So let's get it out there.  An amazing thing happened in New York City Thursday or Friday of last week.  Oh, I can think of 20 things that this could be.  And, you know, we talk about how they love to give tickets in this fine city of ours.  Listen to this story if you haven't heard it yet.  Jennifer Morales, who doesn't want her face shown, wonders how her father's body could go unnoticed for so long.  I'm shocked. 
[01:01:30]  I'm surprised.  This is how the daughter wants to remember her handyman father, 58-year-old George Morales, not as a decomposed body found in a van under the BQE on Wednesday.  He'd been dead a month in a van with four parking tickets.  So they just kept putting parking tickets on a car or a van that had a dead body in it.  Can you see the dead body, though?  As a decomposed guy.  Now, if the guy was in the back trying to get some shit.  Well, they're making it sound like the guy was still at the wheel. 
[01:02:00]  Before he dropped dead.  And they're assuming that he was just, you know, snoozing.  Yeah.  So if he's in the back, but it's under the BQE, that whole area is a dump.  Yeah, I know.  How would you know if you're smelling a dead body?  That's true.  Morales' daughter says her father left their apartment here in Washington Heights on May 5th in a van owned by a friend.  Morales was headed for Long Island and just vanished.  His daughter suspects Morales, who suffered from diabetes and heart problems, may have felt ill and pulled off the road for a nap. 
[01:02:30]  A window was cracked.  The odor became overpowering.  After the car was ticketed each Monday for a month, a marshal, about to tow the van, noticed a body in the back seat.  If you see that a car has already three or four tickets and you're just slabbing more, you know, at least call 911.  When he was found, his daughter says he was not covered with a blanket or coat, but in plain view of anyone who looked inside.  She wonders, what if there were a person inside a car who was ill and needed help? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, all right.  You know, it's such a dad's dad.  Nobody noticed.  She's trying to make a big, like, you know, I need a walk.  We need to all walk on a Saturday with ribbons to make sure this doesn't happen again.  Yeah, they probably fucking thought he was asleep and the ticket people probably didn't notice.  I'm not a fan of the parking ticket like anybody.  No.  Jeez, what the fuck?  No one's fault he was rotting with him and his fucking rotten blood sugar issues.  Don't blame anybody for that.  You want to prevent that from happening?  Tell Pop to get a motel room and sleep. 
[01:03:30]  Not fucking do it under the BQE.  Yeah, I guess there was a back seat in there.  I was thinking like a work van, but he was probably in one of the back seats, just kind  of curled up.  No one looks in there.  Those fucking people come by, they look at the Reggie, and they fucking write the ticket  or print it out or whatever.  Scan your registration now.  That pisses me off.  It spits the ticket out.  So now they're barely at your car.  Yeah, that's it.  Because I like seeing the nervous guys where they're writing the ticket just hoping that 
[01:04:00]  the person isn't going to be coming out of a nearby store.  They give them problems anyway.  Fuckers.  Thickers.  You want a weirdo story?  We got a weirdo.  Weirdo.  We have two of these, actually.  We have a young one and an old one.  Young weirdo, old weirdo.  Well, uh...  Oh, young weirdo.  I think you know which one.  Is this like the horrific story?  Which one?  17 years old?  Is that the one you mean it?  Yeah.  What?  Well, there was a whole thing that happened.  Oh, Paul. 
[01:04:30]  That fucking asshole.  Yeah.  What an animal.  They're only charging him with rape probably because...  Rape and murdered an 18-month-old?  An 8-month-old.  8-month-old.  I'm guessing it wasn't a sexual rape.  It was probably something...  The kid...  It was a horrible story.  No, it was sexual rape.  I don't think that he...  I wonder if he fucked the kid or if he just put something up his ass.  You think so?  Oh, I'll put something...  Like, I think what happened was it was this...  This 17-year-old boyfriend of the kid's mother, the kid was crying.  The guy was just beating this kid. 
[01:05:00]  And he said that the kid...  They found bruises in the kid's rectum or tears.  So that he said, oh, he's shit.  And I was trying to wipe him.  And I hurt him.  But we...  Well, that's a lie.  He probably...  With a lump hammer?  Well, yeah, or a stick.  But he probably inserted something angrily to hurt the kid as opposed to...  Whatever.  But that's a rape with an object.  Sure.  What's wrong with people?  And he has a record, this guy...  Again, a guy like that, they should just lay him down and just put a bullet in his head.  Yeah, there is no reason that this guy should even be part of society anymore. 
[01:05:30]  He has nothing to offer.  Nothing.  The people against the death penalty, they come out when stories like this happen?  Oh, always.  Every life is...  Shut it.  That just amazes me.  We are not the executioners.  God will...  Shut it!  We haven't killed somebody in this country in a long time.  We might kill that dude in California.  Fire dude?  Texas still kills people.  What's the fire dude story?  I don't know.  They gave him the death penalty, I believe.  Don't they? 
[01:06:00]  California?  What the hell was the story?  I didn't think we were going down this road.  Maybe if you could find it for us.  I think he set some fires and some guys died.  Oh, yeah.  They got a lot of that...  I think some of the fire guys died and now they gave him the death penalty.  It's a big story.  If you could find that one for me now that we brought it to the table.  Wow, that one can't hold up.  Huh?  That one can't hold up.  None of them hold up anymore.  I know.  None of them.  It's a fake thing now.  This death penalty.  Appeals after appeals. 
[01:06:30]  Not to bore people with the same old shit, but New York has a death penalty.  Never used it.  It was enacted, what, 15, 17 years ago?  Yeah, whatever.  15 years ago, maybe?  From Pataki first got in.  We haven't killed anybody.  No.  Not a one.  Faggots.  It's a fake thing.  Those people in the strap in that chair.  Or gurney.  Whatever they do.  I say you kill people just to have more room on the highways.  That would be nice.  For real.  See if they could drive right.  Here is the weirdo.  Well, if you do this first, that would really help. 
[01:07:00]  Close the little door.  This is a day Moshe Kai will remember for the rest of his life.  Exciting.  First time I'm graduating.  I'm super proud.  Uh-oh.  I'm so excited, and this day finally come.  We just so joy for you.  This day has finally come for an 11-year-old.  Everyone very, very excited.  What do you guys think? 
[01:07:30]  I think, um, well, uh, he got laid.  Mm, no.  That would be a good answer.  He got a Nobel for you, my friend.  He got a hair on his wiener?  Ah.  Ah, he got one hair on his wiener.  One little.  No.  He graduated.  Not me.  No way.  Not once.  Not never.  He graduated.  Yes.  He graduated.  Good, good.  11 years old.  The sixth grade.  Kindergarten.  He's a dunce.  He's a flithering idiot.  Complete dunderhead.  Dunderhead.  He would eat the chairs. 
[01:08:00]  They would leave him back.  Well, listen to what this braggart's up to.  Yes, the 11-year-old will be a graduate.  A college graduate.  Jesus.  I don't consider myself a genius or because...  You are.  You are.  I consider myself a hard-working person that uses willpower.  No, you're a genius.  Is he a little Asian child?  You're 11 years old.  You're a genius.  Is he a little Asian child?  I, you gotta think.  Asian, I just...  You don't mind that stereotype, right, Asians?  Because they're very, very, very smart, hard-working people. 
[01:08:30]  They were bright people.  Yes.  Well, he's saying like every 11-year-old can, you know, graduate college.  Yeah, I just worked hard.  No.  No.  You got something a little special.  There's lots of dummies out there that doesn't matter how hard they work, they need the Sylvan  Center.  A bunch of fucking retards.  Have to send your kid there.  Oof.  What's that, Ant?  I can't read from here.  Death sentence in wildfire that killed five.  Oh.  Yes, Steve.  A Southern California auto mechanic was sentenced to death Friday for setting a wildfire that 
[01:09:00]  killed a U.S. Forest Service firefighting crew in 2006.  Raymond Lee Euler, 38, heard the penalty pronounced in a hearing in Riverside Superior Court.  The Contra Costa Times reported Judge W. Charles Morgan said he had no reason to override the  recommendation the jury rendered in March.  He was found guilty on March 6th of five counts of first-degree murder and 37 other felonies  for setting the Esperanza fire in the San Jacinto.  It's not going to hold up.  Ant's right.  It's not going to hold up. 
[01:09:30]  A good lawyer will get him out.  He'll get life in prison or something.  Because they can't prove he intended to kill people.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Yeah, exactly.  They'll say he considered it a property crime.  Yeah.  He'll say, I want to burn up some property.  My plan wasn't to kill people.  It's one of these eco-terrorists.  It's unfortunate for those five guys, obviously.  It's the eco-terrorists, man, where they start fires and burn people's houses down and shit.  Spoiled little fuckers, for the most part.  I ought to be drowned.  Let's get the second part of the 11-year-old graduating college. 
[01:10:00]  We first met Moshe when he was just starting college at eight years old.  He says he keeps pretty busy.  Stop it.  Stop it.  How the fuck at eight do you start college?  It's impossible math-wise.  Like, it doesn't work out.  You fucking shoot out of the womb and you're in the fifth grade?  What the fuck happened to this kid?  That's really funny.  There's no way.  It doesn't...  Eight years old.  What grade are you supposed to be in at seven?  Second grade?  Yeah.  Is that about right? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  First, second grade?  So if someone saw him in the second grade and goes, you know...  He's good enough for college.  We got to go right to college with this kid.  Right to college.  Fuck it.  How do you make that leap?  Coloring.  Look, I don't mean to brag a little bit,  but I knew a little something about math when I was growing up.  And I got pushed forward a few grades,  and I thought that was an amazing feat.  You don't want to do that.  I was one of those fuckers in grammar school already in junior high math and all that.  Yeah, but you told us you were a math whiz, 
[01:11:00]  and then we were doing those calculations for gallons.  Oh, yeah.  I lost it all.  I've seen chimps with their toes do better calculations.  Oh, you're 100% right.  And I got nephews and nieces moving up to that algebra and stuff,  and I've bragged about the fact that I know math.  Yeah.  I can't even do a simple algebra problem anymore.  You do know that...  I can't...  Well, I can do the simple ones, actually.  Did you see the phone?  What happened?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Some teenager solved a 300-year-old math problem.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:11:30]  Really?  A 300-year-old math problem that some teenager took a few months and solved it.  How smart could they have been 300 years ago?  Mathematically?  Yeah.  Same thing as now.  Dude, the answer was nine.  Yeah, I know that, and you know that, but they didn't.  I just didn't feel like getting the credit.  I figured, you know what?  Give someone else the credit.  Let someone else go with it.  I got enough cool stuff happening to me.  There's no reason to be an X or a P with numbers.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You're 100% right.  This is unnecessary.  You're so right.  He says he keeps pretty busy, his passion for piano, martial arts, and, of course, there 
[01:12:00]  was school.  Favorite subjects?  Math, physics, astronomy.  Tougher is better.  So it's not surprising he found himself tutoring others.  I'd like to help them to bring them to my level.  For now, things are leveling off for Moshe.  He'll take a break for six months.  Then it's off to a four-year university.  He likes MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley, a bunch of other top schools.  And when he enrolls, he'll still be 11.  So what do you want to be when you grow up?  The future is not ours to see, but I tend to be an astrophysicist, a movie actor, and 
[01:12:30]  compete in the 2016 Olympics.  It's...  Oh, yeah, that'll probably do it all.  He's Michio Kaku Jr.  Kid sounds like a little troublemaker.  Yeah.  A bum.  He plays piano.  Like, how do we have time to go through all the grades, play fucking piano, tutor other  kids?  Ugh.  Imagine being the father of that kid, knowing that you are a dummy compared to your 11-year-old.  Runs circles around you.  Oh, you want to play catch-up?  He needs to smoke some weed. 
[01:13:00]  No, I'm figuring out strength theories.  Little screw-em-up.  Theories this afternoon.  Once he sticks his dick in one girl, it's over.  Die!  Die!  Die!  Die!  You shoot one load, and you're a moron.  You know what?  I think we got another little bit to the story here.  Yeah?  I bet a fist.  I bet a fatalist burned.  Pat our scoom-patted little kid in the background fucking going crazy.  Yeah, he's going crazy, all right? 
[01:13:30]  Crazy!  11 years old, graduating college.  What a gang.  And on the other side of this college thing, we got a 90-year-old.  We're going to get to that in a second.  Yeah.  But we got Brett Michaels, tour manager on the line, Pete.  Hey, Pete, what's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, don't forget guitar player as well.  Guitar player and tour manager.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That's right.  What's up, Pete?  How are you this wonderful morning?  Very good.  Pete, we have to know what happened to Brett. 
[01:14:00]  We saw the clip from the Tony Awards.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's misrepresenting us.  We did not watch the Tony Awards, okay?  I said we saw the clip.  If we knew Brett was on it, maybe we would have watched the beginning of the Tonys.  But, yeah, we saw the clip this morning.  We don't watch that stuff.  You could have gotten away with it in the first couple minutes and still said you didn't watch the Tony Awards.  Right.  All right, good.  So now what I saw was this. 
[01:14:30]  Let me know how accurate I was here.  They're all playing.  Brett decides he's going to get that last bit of hay from the crowd.  And as he turns to walk back, everyone else is already up on the riser, kind of behind this big piece of set that was coming down.  And Brett, I think, from his cowboy hat, didn't see the big piece of equipment and, bam, smacked right into it with his head and hit the ground.  Tell me what happened. 
[01:15:00]  From watching it on YouTube and stuff, I imagine that's exactly what it looks like.  But, you know, let's be honest with you.  The entire thing was timed to a T.  It was rehearsed and rehearsed again.  And Brett's a pro with all that stuff.  And that drop was falling a little bit ahead of time.  It was falling fast as it should.  And Brett had confidence as many times as they'd walk through it that he'd be able to not get hit.  Well, how about he ducks? 
[01:15:30]  He tried ducking when he realized, like, oh, fuck.  He went face first into that thing.  I mean, the cowboy hat definitely probably obstructed the view a little bit.  Yeah.  Again, they'd done it so many times and it'd gone off flawlessly during rehearsals that he walked with confidence because the entire thing was timed to the music.  Everything was timed perfectly.  Yeah, he did walk with confidence right into that thing.  So the curtain key was dropping just a little earlier than it was supposed to.  So how is he doing? 
[01:16:00]  Did he get any injuries from that?  Yeah, man.  His nose is broke from what I understand.  Holy shit.  He's got some stitches and stuff.  It cut his lip up and his nose pretty good.  God damn.  Yeah, they cut right away from when it happened.  They cut to some woman who was just kind of looking like, ooh.  Now, when you saw that, did you howl with laughter like we did?  I actually didn't see it.  I was in the hotel across the street doing some business and stuff, and I got the call to come running over there. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, okay.  I probably saw it the same time you did on YouTube.  Yeah.  Why don't we get Brett on the phone today?  I guess he's out of town.  All right.  He's got a cell phone.  He's got a cell phone.  Come on.  Brett, after the award show last night, he took his private jet and had to go to an undisclosed place after he got stitched up to take care of some other business.  So I don't know.  I don't know.  Get a whore.  An abortion.  Oh, Jesus.  He had to get a trick.  Hey, Pete's laughing. 
[01:17:00]  He went with it.  Oh, great.  All right.  So who's pregnant?  Well, there's three or four of those wreck of low girls are pregnant right now, aren't  they?  Wow.  Damn.  From seasons one, two, and three.  It's going to cost them a couple of bucks.  Yeah.  Well, luckily he's got the money to spend.  Yeah.  We're glad he's okay.  Only a broken nose.  That's all right.  And a lot of exposure today.  Face plant.  I think I would take a broken nose for a lot of exposure.  I think you guys are happy.  It's all over the place.  That's kind of the way he was at the end of it. 
[01:17:30]  You know, you laugh a little bit.  I mean, he's been through motorcycle accidents and fights on stage.  You know, Bob Dolph threw the bass at him pretty hard a couple of years ago when he finished  the set.  So it takes a lot more than a steel backdrop to keep Brett Michaels down.  Brett Michaels walking into cubes.  Yeah.  No way, no how.  Hey, I got to tell you, do they still call him behind the music because Brett Michaels  behind the music or whatever the hell they call him these days, one of the best ever.  You know what? 
[01:18:00]  E! Entertainment did the Brett Michaels True Hollywood Story a couple of months ago.  And then actually in two weeks, they're doing VH1 is going to air the new Brett Michaels  behind the music, which is really cool because really, you know, of artists that have gone  solo, be it like Sammy Hagar or Vince Neil, this is the first time VH1's ever singled  out the artists as opposed to the band they were originally with.  So it's a big deal and they're going to air it in a couple of weeks.  Yeah.  He's had a lot of stuff happen in his life. 
[01:18:30]  You wouldn't believe it.  There's more stuff.  This is just the beginning of the rise of Brett Michaels.  Next year, you're going to see some amazing things.  The autobiography comes out and the book is just killer.  It tells everybody everything you've ever wanted to hear without being raunchy and stupid.  And I mean, it tells all the juice you'd ever want to hear, but it tells it in a very intelligent  and fun way.  Cool.  Yep.  Well, what else do you want us to ask you, Pete?  Jesus. 
[01:19:00]  I just wanted to know how a Brett Schnazola was.  Turning it into a 20-minute Brent Michaels commercial.  I don't know if he's okay, Pete.  I didn't ask for that.  I was having a good time listening about the smart kid and his father.  Yeah, I hear you.  Well, we'll see you guys next time you're through New York.  All right, Pete?  You got it, man.  Thank you very much.  All right.  See, man.  Please tell Pete we say hey.  Or Brett.  I mean, Brett.  Sorry, sorry.  It's Monday.  And yeah, tell him we said hey.  You got it, man.  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  Later.  Thank you. 
[01:19:30]  He smashed his nose.  He's a broken nose for Brett Michaels.  What's the matter?  You don't like your oatmeal today?  I do.  I hate that oatmeal.  I do.  That oatmeal sucks.  I do.  I do.  Downstairs.  It's not award-winning.  No.  So we're talking about college graduates.  And we say this every time this comes out.  Yeah.  You get one of these a year, maybe two.  Hug.  This is your feel-good story, I guess.  A 90-year-old.  Mm-hmm.  Illinois woman gets high school diploma. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, fuck.  She didn't even do the college thing?  You got 11-year-old.  That's only high school?  Ah!  You suck!  High school?  You suck.  Well, you got 11.  I mean, you know what?  This news shouldn't have came out the same day an 11-year-old genius is graduating college.  Yeah.  90-year-old suburban Chicago woman who dropped out of school to help her family during the  Great Depression now has her high school diploma.  Don't use the fucking depression as an excuse.  It ended at some point. 
[01:20:30]  You could have gone back to school.  When did the depression end?  The Great Depression?  19...  You know, after the, uh, when, uh, the shenanigans started with, uh, you know, World War II.  I'm trying to think if I know my history.  Shenanigans.  When did...  In the 30s.  I was going to go 30s.  Yeah.  Okay.  30s.  Uh, Eleanor Benz left Chicago Public Schools Lakeview High in 1936.  1936.  So it was kind of at the end of the depression, right?  Her senior year to take a job. 
[01:21:00]  Over the following decade, she moved to the suburb of, ready for this?  Gurney.  No way!  Another story.  The president allegedly, um, had oral sex with a gentleman that accused him of having oral  sex with him.  Right here in Gurney.  Crack cocaine for Obama, right?  Powder cocaine for him.  Yeah, that's what he said.  Yeah.  Gurney.  And had 15 children, 54 grandchildren, and 37 great-grandchildren. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, Christ.  Well, back then, I guess you had to populate the fucking planet.  She was a baby machine.  No shit, huh?  Uh, she attended night school for typing and bookkeeping.  Good womanly jobs.  Wait.  Did she take a punch back then?  They all could.  They sure could.  Into their place.  My roast.  It's burned.  Bam.  Why would you take typing?  We're all great at typing now, just because of the computer age.  Well, yeah.  Right? 
[01:22:00]  Was she on the ENIAC?  Bookkeeping.  And bookkeeping?  Bookkeeping.  Very important.  But she recently told one of her daughters that never completing high school was one of  the greatest disappointments.  Her children contacted the school, and they just gave her a diploma, it looks like.  Oh, she didn't even have to work for it.  It says the school approved of her diploma, so it looks like she didn't even have to go  back to school for it.  Why don't they do that for me?  I gotta be 90?  Take private fact you don't have one, dude.  Well, you swear all you have to do is complete gym, too, right?  All I fucked up at was some gym credits. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  What a fucking asshole.  Yeah, I know.  He's an asshole.  I thought you were me.  Nah.  So go back.  That's a funny sitcom.  The older gentleman goes back and takes gym class.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Here comes Anthony.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, yeah, I'm just fucking diddling the girls.  Yes.  Oh, he's the oldest kid in class.  He gets them drugs and fucks their heinies.  He's Anthony. 
[01:23:00]  He's older than the teachers, and he makes more money than the whole school.  He's an alcoholic.  He's Anthony.  He needs two credits to graduate.  He makes $8 million a year, but he wants the credits anyway.  Why?  I don't know.  He's Anthony.  Think how cool I could be pulling up in a high school in the Shelby.  See, I'd have a nice car.  I could invite the girls over to the hot tub to drink.  You'd have an excuse to have the high school girls at your house.  Oh, they would fucking clamor. 
[01:23:30]  We're studying.  He tries to be everyone's friend, but he gives all the girls the creeps.  He's Anthony.  They think he's somebody's father who just showed up for no reason.  He's Anthony.  He drives a Shelby.  All the kids key it because they hate his guts.  He's Anthony.  High school girls in the backyard.  They say, we don't care if you have a jacuzzi.  You're a creep.  We all have them, too.  We're rich kids. 
[01:24:00]  You're Anthony.  Stop acting like it's a spaceship, asshole.  It's only your jacuzzi.  It has bubbles.  It gets hot.  We get it.  We get it.  It's a long opening.  It's a very long show.  Sherwin Schwartz has created a show.  Sherwin Schwartz.  There's a lot of things.  Oh, they're going to show Brett gets smacked in the face?  The video's big.  We just got the exclusive.  Broken Nose from Brett Michaels.  They better quote our fucking show.  His legs came off the ground.  Because the press release isn't out yet, my friends. 
[01:24:30]  His legs came off the fucking ground when he hit that thing.  He was walking.  It took his legs right out from under him.  That's right.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  That's right.  Oh, he tries to brag about things that all the kids already have.  What a dope.  He's Anthony.  He tells them he has baseball cards and bubblegum.  Anthony bragged about things that would have been cool in 1975,  but now everyone has them, so they don't care. 
[01:25:00]  He's Anthony.  But he doesn't care as long as just one girl out of the hundred come over.  The one girl who shows up has a Pete Rose haircut.  He fucks her anyway because he's Anthony.  And daddy issues.  Oh, my God.  Hopefully heartburn.  We got some good phone calls coming in here.  I think the phone number's on your unit.  I don't know the fucking phone number. 
[01:25:30]  It's a big unit.  Graham?  You got something on the 11-year-old genius.  Yeah.  Did y'all ever see that episode of Dirty Joss where they're milking thoroughbred horses for their jizz?  Yeah.  Yeah, and they're selling them for like 30 grand a vial.  I was thinking this kid's dad could start selling his jizz.  Ah, have the kid jack off into vials and then sell it as genius kid jizz.  They could maybe even make a Dirty Jobs episode and bring in the topless gymnast and bring the dad in right before he's getting ready to fuck her. 
[01:26:00]  Mike Rowe could pop out and deflect his dick.  All right.  Let's calm down a little bit.  We like your concept.  We got the concept.  The kid's only 11.  Let's calm down a little bit.  Got a couple of years.  It would be a good family business.  Why not?  You can bring in some big bucks, I'm thinking.  Sell genius jizz.  Genius jizz.  Oh, he carries a Trapper Keeper full of Hitler photographs.  He's Anthony.  He tries to quote downfall to all the teenage girls. 
[01:26:30]  He gives them the willies.  He's Anthony.  Let's go to Jared at Boston.  Jared.  He's the only high school student that has hair plugs.  I do not have hair plugs.  They say, hey, there's a toileting cover on that guy's head.  He's Anthony.  No, I don't have plugs.  Just accept it. 
[01:27:00]  You do.  No.  They just changed the name.  That's all.  No, they're individual follicles placed independently.  You don't even have it in you anymore to try to explain.  Plugs are those eraser-sized things that they put in your head that made you look like you had Barbie doll hair.  These are very individual.  Every hair is individually placed.  It takes forever.  Not forever, but, you know, good fucking ten hours.  While all the kids are having a catch, Anthony's passed out with guns in his hand.  He's Anthony. 
[01:27:30]  The show should be 25 minutes of the opening song, and then maybe five minutes of actual.  Five minutes of me trying to do pull-ups or something.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, running through the gym.  I forgot.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you know, I've got to run through gym class.  Christian, it looks like.  Miller plays.  Christian.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hi, sir.  Good morning, Christian.  A couple years ago.  I've been a fan since day one, and a couple years ago, sitting in a college class for coaching at Stony Brook, and the professor's in front of me.  He's talking.  He goes, yeah, there's some guy, Anthony, on the radio who's blaming me for failing high school. 
[01:28:00]  And, of course, that catches my attention.  And he knows, the professor knows that Anthony talks about him on the radio.  He's like, yeah, if he had just finished his phys ed classes, maybe I would have passed him.  He was a derelict when I knew him.  He had some nice things to say in English.  Was he Cirillo?  That's him.  Yeah.  Coach Cirillo.  You know what, though?  You shouldn't fail.  I was a degenerate back then.  I was.  If you passed everything but Jim, you've got to give the kid the diploma. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, hand me the diploma.  We all know Anthony better than that.  That's right.  You know why?  Because when he was in high school, he had hair like Lawrence Hilton Jacobs.  He's Anthony.  All right, have a great day, guys.  Thank you, sir.  Wow, he's a professor at Stony Brook now.  What is he professing?  Toes on the line?  Oh, shit.  No, you didn't.  Bring your shorts home and wash them every so often?  Come here.  Come here.  Come here. 
[01:29:00]  Why don't you have your uniform?  Toes on the line.  Toes on the line.  Come here.  Why don't you have your uniform?  It's not a uniform.  They're called fucking shorts.  And no, I don't have them.  I'm just, I got my sneakers on with my jeans.  What are we going to be doing that?  I really need fucking, like, workout attire.  Stupid.  We got to fucking play goddamn volleyball.  They should have worked something out with you.  That's dumb.  Let's go to Eric and me.  Toes on the line.  That's what I remember from him.  Why toes on the line? 
[01:29:30]  Because we all have a standard attention because we're in the fucking military for some reason  with gym teachers.  Before you do a little kickball.  They think they're drill instructors.  You're not.  You're a failed fucking athlete.  Oh, that's true.  No way.  No how.  Failed athletes.  His anger at the teachers comes out when he's in class.  He gets thrown out again because he's 53.  He's Anthony.  53?  Come on.  I don't know his real age. 
[01:30:00]  I'm Jim.  Let's go to Eric and me.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  Maybe Jimmy can make a song about this.  The girls are going to think he's creepy, but just imagine how the boys are going to feel  when they have to shower with them after gym class and they see that massive hog.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  That could be a problem.  That's right.  Don't shower with the other boys.  I'll take cold showers.  Speaking of that, his hog hangs out, his gym shorts.  He's Anthony.  His big delicious cock.  Shouldn't be black.  It's not. 
[01:30:30]  He's Anthony.  Uh-oh.  We got something.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Call me up.  Call me up.  Call me up.  I'm sitting back down at the 7-Eleven, but someone said he made it okay.  I'm in.  First, Bueller.  Very nice.  Where's Mr. Kumia?  Is he still on campus?  I think I saw him by the food machine.  Maybe you could get a little, like, Rudy moment. 
[01:31:00]  You go back to high school and you get on the football team or something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's what I would do.  They carry him off the field going, Kumia?  Yeah, that's exactly what I would do.  They carry him off the field because he's been tackled by a 6'5 guard and is paralyzed  below the neck.  Yeah, they have to carry him off and get a fucking tube so he can breathe.  But then they go.  That's funny, man.  Then they go, you know, he's suffered enough, so they give you the diploma.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they put it in his teeth, and he's sitting in that chair with his fucking staring  straight ahead with his stupid little fucking cardboard hat on. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, he shits into a bag.  He breathes into a tube.  He's Anthony.  Holy shit.  They put the gown and cap on your lifeless body.  Oh, he used to drive a Shelby.  Now he wears adult diapers.  He's Anthony.  Wow, this has to take a turn, Jim.  I don't think I like going back to school now.  That's what happens.  I know.  Jared in Utah has one.  Jared?  Jared, while the kid's all having a smoke, he's old enough for a stroke, he's Anthony. 
[01:32:00]  Hey!  No!  How dare you?  Let's go to Chris in New York.  Chris?  Yo.  Hey.  I had a teacher flunk me for my gym class so that I had to go back for the 13th grade.  And for half a year, I just took nothing but gym.  That's what I was supposed to do.  What do you mean nothing but gym?  You had to do a whole other year?  I had to take two periods of gym a day.  So I had until noon taking gym classes that me and my stoner buddy, who also had to take 
[01:32:30]  the 13th grade, kept skipping out on gym.  You know what a bunch of bullshit that is, though, man?  I mean, come on.  You're going to school.  Don't give me shit about fucking gym class.  What is that going to do?  The worst part is the guy decided to open a driving range when he retired.  So every day, he's fucking just hitting golf balls.  After flunking a bunch of kids in gym. 
[01:33:00]  What an idiot.  Go for him.  It should be a leisure activity.  Like, you're doing your school thing, and now it's like, you know, if you want to run  around the gymnasium for a while, go ahead.  Yeah.  If you don't, that's fine, too.  Your whole fucking future shouldn't depend on whether you did enough pull-ups during  the presidential physical fitness test.  I love gym, but...  Thank you.  But what is it...  I hated it.  Oh, who doesn't love gym?  But what does it matter in the end?  You got enough exercise when you weren't in school.  I know.  It didn't matter. 
[01:33:30]  When did you stop getting a lot of exercise?  Running around like I'm nuts.  17, 18, maybe?  The second I started smoking pot.  Yeah, see?  17, 18.  Let me go to John in New York.  John.  Hello, John.  Hi, John.  Hi, John.  Why do I picture Anthony pulling up in front of the school in a black Trans Am jamming  an R.O. speed wagon?  Oh, that would be the ultimate creep.  Sitting in the car with the windows open until that one part with the lyrics you wanted everybody 
[01:34:00]  to hear was over?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You would time that shit, Jimmy?  No, I didn't drive in high school, but I know I'm a fucking total douche.  I know I would have.  I drove my Dodge Aspen wagon.  I had a Baja bug.  That's right.  A Baja bug?  No, that's a cool fucking high school vehicle.  It was like a dune buggy thingy.  That's very cool.  Yeah, that's why I was degenerate.  He's a shit degenerate.  Did I say that?  Raging Bull?  Yeah.  Did I say that?  Oh, my God.  This is a good one. 
[01:34:30]  Less in Alabama.  Alabama, move!  Less.  If Anthony went back to school and he had sex with one of the teachers, would the teacher  get charged with having sex with an underage student or what?  Oh, he got it all backwards.  Yeah, well.  See, I would be in trouble for having sex with somebody who is underage, even if I had  sex with the teacher.  Now he laughs at his own joke.  I cleaned it up for you there, Les. 
[01:35:00]  All right, buddy.  Let's go to Matt on Long Island.  Matt.  He took you to the prom.  He's older than your mom.  He's older than your mom.  He's older than your mom.  He's older than your mom.  Fuck you.  That's funny.  Fucking guy nailed it.  Fucking nailed it.  Chris in Houston.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Chris.  Go back to 1959.  Hop in the DeLorean, Anthony.  Get your diploma there.  Then I'll fit in.  Yeah.  That's bullshit. 
[01:35:30]  I'm going to Hill Valley High School.  You don't care, right?  About a diploma?  Yeah.  I don't even think about it.  Yeah.  I could give a flying fuck-a-roonie, as they say.  Doesn't matter to me.  School's a waste of time.  Fuck it.  Who cares?  School?  Forget about it.  A few classes were worth it.  Not me.  And the socializing was very worth it.  Got to prepare for the real world.  Yeah.  The rest of it was bullshit.  I did a lot of socializing.  Bullshit.  That's all I did.  Books.  No way, no how.  Books.  It was the book hands.  Reading books. 
[01:36:00]  Fuck you.  No way.  No how.  Never.  Oh.  He quotes a lot from The Shining, and none of the kids have seen it.  So they think he's retarded.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  He's Anthony.  Oh, I hated kids like this guy.  Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Hey, what's going on?  I went to school in New York City, and my last, my senior year of high school, I had  my gym classes, my last class of the day.  I had a one-to-five schedule.  I only had five classes.  I was on the baseball team. 
[01:36:30]  The baseball coach was a gym teacher.  He tells me, hey, Joe, this is your last class.  I'm like, yeah.  He goes, see you in June.  I said, I'll see you in June.  Never went to class all year long.  Passed with an A, whatever.  My two buds tried to do the same thing.  They had to go to summer school to graduate.  Oh, what were you doing to the coach that he gave you a little favor there?  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  Yeah, they were the coach's pets, you know, because they were on the football teams or baseball.  You know what?  I kind of hated guys like you, but it makes sense if you're, you know, I practice after 
[01:37:00]  school every day playing for the high school team, whether it's baseball, whatever.  Yeah, why would you have to take gym, too?  It's a waste of time.  Coach Cirillo.  It's not working out as it is, but my senior year classes were even worse.  I mean, this was New York City schools in the 1980s.  Like, yeah, I'm around the same age as Opie.  My first class of the day was ceramics.  My second class of the day was English.  All right, I had to go there.  Then I had homeroom, independent study photography, and sports history.  That was it. 
[01:37:30]  Then I went to McDonald's, and I was about that day.  Sports history?  What did you fucking go to school?  It was that trivial pursuit.  Come on.  Sports history?  That's not a class.  Mm-mm.  That's what it was.  Oh, what a fucking clusterfuck.  I got so screwed.  Stupid Coach Cirillo.  See?  See what he said?  That I was degenerate.  He did catch me smoking pot, though, outside.  I was smoking a big...  I took such a huge hit off of this doobie outside. 
[01:38:00]  And I pulled it in, and it was by the back gym doors, and they fling open, and there's  Cirillo, like right in front of me.  He hated it.  And he just...  He took his pointer finger and jabbed it into my stomach immediately, and I just went...  And just blew pot smoke out.  And he's like, get to the office.  That sounds like a John Hughes film.  Dude, it absolutely happened.  He poked me...  Because he knew, like, kids smoke pot back there.  So he was listening.  Why are you smoking pot right at the door? 
[01:38:30]  Because you were the cool guy that smoked pot by the door, even though the gym teacher  came out every so often.  Oh.  Yeah, high school fucking thought pattern.  Yeah.  So he would listen, and if you're out there, and he smelt it and stuff, he would fling  that door open and just poke you in the gut.  And you'd go...  And I just blew a big fucking thing of smoke out in his face.  What an asshole.  And he goes, go to the office.  Go to the office.  Now.  Yeah.  What is this about?  This is just mean, man. 
[01:39:00]  Dave in Tennessee.  Hey, Anthony, you're that guy that shows up at the party, 50 years old, with a letterman  jacket and mill pattern baldness.  Well, you got the mill pattern baldness taken care of.  A letterman jacket.  And I'm not 50.  Shut up.  Jesus.  And I don't have a letterman jacket.  I show up.  Hey, girls.  I lettered in track.  That was an accomplishment.  Fuck that.  I lettered in track.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  Do you still have your jacket?  No, you're making fun of me.  Do you have your jacket?  Hell no.  Let me say hi to...  Did you have a big H for Harmerfield?  I still have the big H.  I never put it on anything.  Did you wear it?  No.  Did you ever wear it?  Yeah.  I got the big H for being on a varsity team.  Should have been followed by IV.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  When running, he gets cramps.  The people call him Gramps.  He's Anthony. 
[01:40:00]  I got the fucking H.  All right.  What's up, guys?  Let's say hi to Alex in Jersey.  Alex.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hi.  Yeah.  My gym teacher wouldn't pass me, so instead of going to summer school, I just dropped out  my senior year and got my GED.  Took the year off, went to college, and then I ran into him a couple years later, and he  shit his pants, but I don't remember the money I was making.  Yeah, gym teachers make no money.  Oh, believe me, I never...  They were bitter, those guys. 
[01:40:30]  I never bragged about anything, and I pretty much never had contact with these people, but  they've heard.  I know a few people that I talk to that have talked to certain teachers that I went to school  with, and they've heard of my accomplishments throughout the years.  So, yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry I didn't fucking get your diploma from your fucking school.  I think most teachers don't get it.  Like, they should be embracing people like yourself in high school, but instead... 
[01:41:00]  Maybe I would have made a donation to their radio program.  Maybe I would have.  Maybe that's what it'll take to get a diploma.  No way, no how.  I'll say, look, I'll make a donation to your radio program.  I know they had a radio program.  And I'll say, yeah, I'll buy you some equipment with this little donation.  You give me the old sheepskin, and we're fucking quid pro quo.  I got my diploma.  For what?  What do I need a fucking diploma for?  I got a GED three years after I got sober, which was probably about 21. 
[01:41:30]  I just didn't need it.  And that's not a diploma.  Yeah.  A fucking diploma.  General equivalency.  General equivalency diploma.  I've never seen the phones lit like this to talk about gym.  We're talking about high school dropouts.  What do you think?  Our listeners are all common.  We're talking about men.  Watch the phone fucking go blank.  Barry.  Yo.  Hey, Barry.  Hey, man.  Check this one out.  Now, I'm the state champion and all that in track. 
[01:42:00]  I'm the opposite of the guy who got the free ride from the gym teacher.  I got failed.  I got an incomplete because I refused to take gym.  I refused.  So you got...  Here he is, Barry.  He's a great athlete, and the gym teacher fucks him over.  Yeah.  Basically, don't you take gym to be a better, I don't know, athlete or something?  Yeah, you would think.  But if you're already a great athlete, then why would you fail gym because you're not really  going because you're a great athlete, like, playing on the team?  Right.  It doesn't make sense.  Barry's gone? 
[01:42:30]  All right.  Whatever.  Let me say hi to Kirk in Kentucky.  Kirk.  Yeah.  Guys, I'm 16.  I'm still a junior.  Okay.  Is that bad?  I don't have any advice on how to make it through the next two years.  I've been listening to your show since I was 12.  Well.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  This bitch.  Wait a minute.  This freshman, sophomore, junior, senior. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  Yes.  So you only have one more.  No, junior.  I'll be a junior.  Oh, you'll be a junior.  We're in summertime now, so that makes sense.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got junior and senior year to go.  Junior and senior.  You're 16, 17, 18.  Okay.  What kind of advice do you need?  Why?  You having trouble?  You seem to have made it so far pretty good.  I don't want to drop out and then you have to pick up some chicks.  Oh, well, then just leave.  Fuck it.  No, I've always regretted not graduating because it did hold me back for things I wanted to do. 
[01:43:30]  Not the high school diploma, but the need to have one in order to go to, like, college.  I would have done that now.  Knowing what I know now, I would have done that.  Although I would have known that I would have gotten into radio, so I said fuck it a lot earlier.  I think you wanted to go to college.  Yeah.  You like getting knowledge.  I wanted to go to college.  Did you really?  Actually, I wanted to, you know. 
[01:44:00]  Get laid.  I wanted to go to, like, I wanted to be in the Rotsies.  Oh, really?  I would have liked to have, you know, joined, like, officer school.  Officer training school.  Yeah, why didn't you join the military?  I was afraid.  For real?  No, because I fucked up in school and everything.  And I knew I could just go in as an enlisted guy like my brother did.  I wanted officer training.  Oh, I see.  So if you got the diploma and all that.  Yeah, I would have had to have, you know, gone to school and shit.  I want your D-O-R. 
[01:44:30]  D-O-R.  Drunk on request.  I could do that for you, sir.  I was watching Navy SEAL.  Navy SEAL training.  On the military channel.  Holy fuck.  That hell week they put them through.  Oh, I can only imagine.  Un-fucking-believable.  That they're eating and falling asleep.  They don't let these fucking guys sleep.  They got to carry these huge fucking 150-pound boats over their heads with the rest of their boat squad.  And the whole time, the instructors are throwing sand at them and shoving like oars full of sand down their back. 
[01:45:00]  So they're all chafed up and cut.  And then they make them go into freezing cold water and just sit there.  And then there's the bell.  And people just get up.  Ding, ding.  Ring that fucking bell.  You want to ring that bell?  You want to ring that bell?  Get out.  And it's just a guy.  In your face.  He doesn't even talk to you.  He talks through a bullhorn right into your face.  Come on.  What's your problem?  What are you doing?  Get over there.  Get.  Now, because you did that, the rest of your guys have to do push-ups. 
[01:45:30]  And then you just stand there like private pile with your thumb in your mouth as the rest of your guys do push-ups.  And just the SEAL training looked fucking horrifically tough.  Isn't it an hour a night they get to sleep for a week?  Yeah.  It's like even that is inconsistent.  And then they eat.  And when they're sitting in the mess hall eating, they show these guys literally falling asleep in their food.  And then they try to stand up because they've been active the whole time. 
[01:46:00]  And you know how when your legs freeze up on you after you've been active for a little while?  And they're like walking like they're crippled.  Wow.  And then back out, same fucking thing.  Lift that goddamn boat over your head, run around with it, digging holes.  Where do you see this?  This is on the military channel.  You can find it on the old YouTube or something?  Dude, the food.  Like after they put the food in the garbage, that's what they make them eat is the fucking garbage.  I've seen that too where they have.  Because it's all just guys eating food. 
[01:46:30]  It's not from.  It's like they cook them food, they eat it.  And whatever they throw out, that's the next meal.  Like they have to eat that.  I've seen that too.  They're constantly throwing sand at them too.  It's like that's got to be so fucking annoying.  And then they make them, yeah, they make them lock arms and lay in the surf.  As the tide's coming.  And it's fucking cold.  You just see these guys shaking.  They're freezing cold.  And then you have to run with all your equipment on into the water, roll around, and then run back within 60 seconds or the squad you're in has to do push-ups. 
[01:47:00]  So you have to fucking do it or else you fuck your guys over.  How many guys do we lose every year?  I think there were.  No, I mean lose.  Oh, dying?  I don't know.  They started out something like one squad started out with 30, I think.  30 candidates and only 9 made it.  Wow.  Another one started out with 50 and I think 19 made it or something.  Really, some of the toughest training I've ever seen people have to go through. 
[01:47:30]  Ridiculous.  Animals, man.  These guys are fucking animals to pull this off.  Yeah.  They bust them apart physically.  And then toward the end they just start hitting them mentally too.  They get a lot of that mental shit on them.  They fuck with their brains.  Well, you got the phones ringing to talk about this.  So why don't we take a quick break, regroup, and we can continue with this.  Can you see they're all laying arm in arm in the sand with the fucking tide coming up?  And then look, that guy's just yelling at them. 
[01:48:00]  And their legs are up like doing ab exercises.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  The yelling is the easy part in that situation, you got to think.  You know what, though?  What they're saying to you like fucks their heads up.  Yeah.  Like these guys are good.  They know what the fuck to yell at these people.  It's not just like, hey, you look stupid.  You know, they're yelling at them about how they don't have the commitment.  Ring the bell.  Ring it.  You don't have what it takes.  I know you're going to be out of this.  No!  And they're yelling like fucking, no, no, I'll never do it.  And then they set up the bell at this other location.  And they had one of the guys that was in training. 
[01:48:30]  He goes, you're testing the bell now.  We got to make sure the bell works.  Kneel in front of it.  The guy kneels.  He goes, now ring the bell.  And the guy goes, no, sir.  He goes, we're testing this bell.  You ring that bell.  And the guy's like, no, I will not ring that bell.  I will not.  He goes, all right, get out of here.  Like they were seeing if he would have rang the fucking bell.  You think they would have kicked him out?  I probably would have.  He rang the fucking bell.  Oh, shit.  That's sneaky.  It is.  They do like to mind fuck these guys.  That was smart on that guy's part.  Well, you got Special Forces, Air Force. 
[01:49:00]  Everybody's checking in now.  So quick break.  And we'll continue with this a little bit and get into some other things.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Man, I got to listen to that show.  Yeah, man, man, man.  Yeah, right?  Sounds exciting.  Make us sound like rock stars.  Let's go to Brew in D.C.  Brew, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, Brew.  So I made it through Special Forces training, all 24 days of the selection process, and still  didn't get picked.  Why?  Because they test you on all sorts of different things like team working abilities and 
[01:49:30]  some psychological testing and so on.  So you go through all that brutality, and they're like, sorry, not this time, but hey, you're  welcome to come back.  A little don't ask, don't tell going on in your life there, sir?  No, actually.  The game, you hot dog, and you sat on it?  No.  You failed the homosexuality test?  No, actually, my 14-mile rock time was slow. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, yeah?  Wait, your 14-mile what time?  Rock time.  You got a huge backpack that weighs about 75 pounds, and you got to run it out for distance.  You got to go 14 miles?  Why 14?  Why not 10?  Jesus.  Why not 20?  Why not two?  Why not you just stay home?  Why not eight?  Why not just hop in a Hummer?  Because, you know, they're still using the old war tactics where you might have to walk  in to a jungle somewhere.  Just get a gun and lay down. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, that's true.  You guys do 14-mile runs in the military?  That's crazy.  Well, no.  See, there's about three weeks in this process.  The first week is all your really horrible stuff with lifting huge telephone poles and  then running around the sand doing your obstacle course and such.  But then you have two runs, two rucks, and then I can't remember what the last piece was,  but the one run is about 15 miles. 
[01:51:00]  The other one's six.  The 14-mile ruck and the six.  And they're all timed events.  Wow.  They don't even tell you how long we had to figure it out at the end.  Washed out.  Amazing.  Well, see, and that's what makes me wonder about professional athletes because I did this  on a knee that probably should have put me down for three weeks.  One guy broke his feet, you know, and then at the very end, they have a 28-mile ruck that 
[01:51:30]  you have to do.  What the fuck?  So, wait.  Enough with the rucks.  Is that walking or running?  A run, walk, ruck?  Well, yeah.  But, see, one guy, one savage we had did it in, he did the 28 miles in, like, three  and a half hours.  Wow.  Could you hold your thought, Brew, for one second, please?  Here comes old Nicky arriving to work.  Let's all look at little Nicky's coming.  Hi, old Nicky.  Hi, little Nicky.  How are you today?  What's in the bag today? 
[01:52:00]  What do you got in the bag?  All right, sir.  Little Nicky's back.  Looks like Ross's purse.  Brew back to you.  Yeah.  No, but that's just what we do in the Army.  We're a bunch of savages.  Yeah, well, that's what they want.  Well, we had one guy get shot in the stomach while he was on a turret, drops back down in  the vehicle, gets back up, and starts shooting again.  But then the second shot got right in the crotch area, so he had to lay down for a bit.  Is he alive?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  This is a couple of tough shots. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  They were just animals.  Yeah.  Crotch, thank you, sir.  Crotch Critter brings up a good point.  Okay.  Hey, Crotch Critter.  Hey, Ant, what you're forgetting is that before these guys even get to the point to where  they're at the school, these dudes are freaking monsters.  Yep.  Good point.  They've gone through all kinds of training to begin with.  We had a guy in boot down at Sand Dog. 
[01:53:00]  He was seal-qualified in boot camp, and this guy was built like a brick shithouse.  Dude, you are absolutely right.  I was watching the show last night, and all I kept thinking was, they are fucking monsters,  these guys.  You can't just get a guy that goes, yeah, I want to be a seal, and jump in there.  You have to start out being a big fucking football player kind of guy.  Plus, you need to serve in the military service anyway to even qualify for this.  You can't just come out the street and say, I want to be a seal. 
[01:53:30]  No, you go through basic training, and then you can, I think after that, you can sign up,  can't you?  Well, what it is...  Like, right out of basic?  Yeah, well, this guy, they have seal qual right there, and you do your regular physical  fit test, and you have to do, like, X amount of push-ups, sit-ups, all that kind of crap.  Run with your boondockers on, I mean, the whole nine yards.  You're fully dressed out and everything else.  Then, if you want to seal qual, then you go, and instead of, like, the mile-and-a-half 
[01:54:00]  girly run, you do, like, a five-mile run in boots and everything else.  Yeah.  And you, basically, you have to, in boot camp, you have to qual is what they call Iron Man,  and then from there, you go, and they have an opportunity for a certain amount of people  to seal qual.  We had one guy, and I swear to God, you know, I know you guys are into the MMA stuff.  This dude looked like he could whoop anybody's ass at all. 
[01:54:30]  I mean, he was, like I said, built like a brick shithouse.  And he qualled.  It's just, I mean, it's unbelievable what these guys look like.  Yeah, they've got to be giant.  I was watching, when I was watching this last night, they show these things that they have  to do with the boats.  They're these rubber boats, but they're fucking, they weigh, like, a hundred and some odd pounds.  And they have to put it on the ground, and then real quick, bam, lift it up over their  heads, and hold it over their heads with their arms stretched straight up.  And you see, like, their arms are shaking, and then they go, okay, put it back down. 
[01:55:00]  Now, look it back up, and it's like, how the fuck do you do that?  Let me, let me, let me, this is one thing, in boot camp there in Sand Dog, in San Diego  for the, for the, uh, civilians.  But, uh, what it is, I'm gonna tell you this, you can do it right there in the studio.  Get you a pen or a pencil, stand up between your index fingers, put the pen or pencil between  your fingers, and hold your arms straight out in front of you. 
[01:55:30]  I guarantee you, after about three minutes, you'll drop it.  Really?  And that's just a pencil.  Imagine a Zodiac with all your rucksacks in it, and six or eight guys trying to hold  that motherfucker up in the air.  Are there guys...  Just put it on your shoulder.  Just hold it with your arms extended up in the air.  Jimmy's doing it right now, so let's see how long...  Over your head?  Hey, let me ask you.  No, straight out.  Straight out, Jimmy.  Now you gotta start over.  Are there guys, like, nobody probably aces this, but are there guys that have a fairly 
[01:56:00]  easy time with the physical, just guys that are just in shape motherfuckers?  Oh yeah, this guy that I'm talking about that was in our company, man.  I mean, it didn't matter.  I mean, he was doing like the, uh, we had some little Guamanian guy about four foot tall  that he led all the, all the, the runs and everything else.  He was one of the company commanders.  And, uh, he sat there and, and the guy that I'm talking about, uh, every single time,  uh, a mile and a half run, I mean, he was the first one down the line. 
[01:56:30]  Uh, he was a guide on, you know, we had like a little company flag and everything else.  He's the one that had been held back and would run the whole entire time.  Like it wasn't nothing.  You get done after a mile and a half and my fat ass is just sweating my balls off.  And he's, he's just sitting there, you know, oh, okay, well, is that it?  Can we do it again?  Yeah.  There are those guys that just fucking physical.  Yeah.  They can just, it doesn't matter.  You fucking do anything to them.  They said after a while of this training, um, uh, of like hell week, the physical part 
[01:57:00]  doesn't matter to the guys anymore.  The ones that have washed out have washed out and the ones that are left pretty much,  you can't conquer them physically anymore.  So they try to break them down mentally, uh, to see, to see if that's the end of it.  And that sand, by the way, isn't just annoying on you.  It gets under your armpits and actually causes cuts.  It rips these fucking guys' bodies apart, the backs of their neck on the collars.  They, there was a guy that was doing pushups as an instructor was taking an oar and taking 
[01:57:30]  oar loads of sand and shoving it down his collar behind his neck.  And just unbelievable how the fuck, I would hate it.  That's called making sugar cookies, by the way.  The guy's laying it.  When you're wet and rolling around the sand.  Yeah, he's rolling around covered in fucking sand.  That looks fun.  Yeah.  We've worked on that.  That's fun, right?  A lot of fun.  Hey, uh, uh, Crotch Critter, thank you, but I want to give, uh, time to some other people  here.  We got a retired, we got a retired Navy guy saying everyone's wrong so far. 
[01:58:00]  Let's see what's right, what's wrong.  Tim in Phoenix.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  I'm right, Tim.  I love the show.  Thanks, Tim.  Hey, actually, I'm a Navy chief.  I retired April 30th.  I finished up on recruiting.  I'm not saying everybody's wrong, but these guys are actually prepared from the time they  enlist for SEAL training.  Oh, really?  You have to actually, you can actually enlist as a SEAL now.  Oh, so you go through basic as a prospect.  Exactly.  It's actually, it's its own rank now.  You know, we have ratings in Navy.  I was in air crewmen in helicopters. 
[01:58:30]  I did insertions and extractions.  Wow, shit.  Actually, it's their weight.  They do prep while they're on delayed entry prior to going to boot camp.  At boot camp, they actually get taken out of their boot camp company and do special SEAL  training, you know, swim time, run.  Once they get to Coronado, they actually have their own class where it's all prep prior to  getting into school.  Huh.  Huh.  So they actually are brought along.  I mean, their training, you're looking at a good couple of years.  Oh, here's a guy ringing the bell. 
[01:59:00]  Done.  He's done.  And the fact that these guys, I mean, the biggest guys you would think would make it,  some of the smallest guys I saw when I was stationed in Coronado were the ones that made  it.  Like you said, Anthony, it's mental.  Yeah, yeah.  A huge amount of mental fucking shit they got to go through.  It's amazing.  Oh, yeah.  But certainly.  When I was in seer school with these guys, and they were just the smartest guys, they  were phenomenal.  Well, what happened, though, if the guy was putting sand on your back, if you said, look,  that really makes this difficult.  It's making this very uncomfortable to wear this shirt, if you wouldn't mind not doing 
[01:59:30]  that.  Yeah, the sugar cookie thing.  I did that in Pensacola when I was going through search and rescue school as a rescue  swimmer.  And yeah, you roll around and you have to run around.  Yeah, you chase a little bit on that.  A little bit.  I can imagine.  That just looks un-fucking-comfortable.  Because sugar cookies just sound so delicious and fun when you sign up.  We're going to be doing sugar cookies?  Okay.  Nice.  Oh, boy.  Let me move on to John in Cleveland.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, Tim.  John, retired Navy SEAL on the line. 
[02:00:00]  John.  And they have explosive paint.  Thermite.  What's up, John?  Oh, not too much.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Hey, a lot of these guys are right and wrong, but it's a detail that...  We pay attention to a lot of detail.  There is a prep school for SEAL training.  You know, when I went through, there wasn't that, but there is now.  And you do declare it as a present day.  But it is one of the most brutal things you'll ever do in your life.  Yeah, it does look like just fucking something that... 
[02:00:30]  I wouldn't last three seconds in that training.  Well, how long is SEAL training?  I mean, we have Hell Week, but how long is the actual training for SEAL?  Well, you have your prep schools.  Then you usually have 16 weeks of that.  Then you have a one-year probationary period set to a SEAL team.  You're looking at well over two years when it's all said and done.  When do you do Hell Week?  In the first 16 weeks?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  Yeah, you do it right at the tail end of it. 
[02:01:00]  When I did my final one, when I did my final Hell Week, I actually had stress fractures in one of my legs.  I duct taped it so I could finish the run.  Or I have to repeat what they call every evolution.  That means you start from the beginning.  You just don't repeat that one segment.  Oh, shit.  You got to go right back.  Exactly.  You repeat everything from day one.  Excuse me.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  There's guys that go through it like two or three times?  Yeah, you can do a max of three times.  You can reapply, and if the instructors feel that you're still possibly qualified or have 
[02:01:30]  the mindset, in SEAL training, it's a mindset.  It's something you never lose.  I've been retired for a lot of years.  And I'm still a psychopath.  I'm still edgy.  I'm still, you know, I go into places I don't like a room.  I have to leave because I don't know what I'm going to do.  Jesus.  He still cuts the ear off every Vietnamese guy he meets.  He's very unpleasant at dinner parties and art galleries.  Your food is your slice. 
[02:02:00]  Because then you do your specialty trainings.  You know, if you're a corpsman, if you're more demolitions, if you're a sniper, they  set these teams, six- to eight-man teams, to absolutely just wreak havoc.  Yeah.  And you can increase those teams.  You can double them.  You can triple them.  You know, there's assault teams.  But you run six to eight guys, and you'd be surprised how much chaos you can rank. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, I don't doubt it, man.  Yeah, pretty cool.  But I appreciate your time, and I want to thank you again.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thank you, John.  See you, man.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Thank God he's one of ours.  Jesus.  Yeah, I know.  Let's say hi to Russ in Ohio.  It's not like the old days.  Like, you look at World War II, we watch some of those shows, and it's like, you know,  yes, I enlisted, and before I knew it, I was flying a P-51 Mustang.  They're just like, hey, you want to be a pilot?  They asked me if I wanted to be a pilot of a B-17 bomber, and I said, sure. 
[02:03:00]  It's like, they just grab people off the street.  They got it all figured out now.  Very involved.  Russ.  Yes.  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I trained with the British SAS, and their final exam, the United States Delta Force uses  the same pretty much exam.  It costs 42 miles cross-country with rucksack and weapons.  42 miles.  42 miles.  I don't like driving that far. 
[02:03:30]  It's a pain in the ass.  Yeah, it's brutal.  There's a guy I read about that literally, when he was done, the soles of his feet were  gone.  They left the...  He's a legend in Delta.  He walked the feet, the soles of his feet off.  Wow.  We're just watching these poor motherfuckers holding up a giant telephone pole.  You'll never need to do that.  I would say that.  Coach, we don't need to do this.  They're losing it.  They're losing it.  If you get a chance, pick up a book called Bravo 2-0. 
[02:04:00]  It's about a British SAS team in Iraq.  Yeah, we're also getting people talking about another book.  Thank you, Russ.  We're going to go to Mike in Oakdale.  Mike.  Hey, Matt.  What's going on?  How you doing, man?  Hey, Mike.  You guys got to get the book, Lone Survivor.  It's a guy from Patchogue who won the Medal of Honor.  And it talks about his SEAL team going into Afghanistan and picking out hundreds and hundreds of guys. 
[02:04:30]  And there was only four of them.  Yeah, I don't doubt it, you know?  These fucking guys are trained like motherfuckers.  Yeah, you really got to pick this book up.  I mean, he's got a Long Island-based guy, Medal of Honor.  He fucking wreaks serious havoc over there in Afghanistan.  And it's called Lone Survivor.  Yeah, Lone Survivor.  Sounds like a good read.  Michael Murphy from Patchogue, Long Island.  And when you look at this instructor with the mustache yelling at these guys,  these instructors seem like really tough guys to make laugh. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like, they're not silly men.  No, not silly at all.  And I always wondered what Bill Buckner was doing after he missed that point.  Yeah, he does look like Bill Buckner.  To make these guys laugh, you got to have a good kill story, or are you almost going to kill?  Bill Buckner, man, are almost killed.  What happened to you?  It's my fucking knife.  I dropped it.  They're all laughing.  What happened?  I stabbed them.  But, you know, still, what the fuck?  The knife falls and fucking shit and blood.  They're like, ah, get out of here, you.  That's how you make those guys laugh.  You have to relate to them on that level. 
[02:05:30]  On that fucking savagery level.  Yeah.  Well, fuck, Ant turning us on to something.  I got to check this out.  Yeah, really, really cool.  And it's on what?  Military Channel.  Military Channel.  Which, by the way, is now on my TV.  It's just about beating out the History Channel now.  Uh-oh.  If the History Channel doesn't step it up with some new Hitler shit, the Military Channel.  They had Best Weapons last night, and they were showing, like, weapons, a shock and awe.  It was like the best type of shock and awe.  And they rate them on fear, like how much fear they instill in people, how economical they are, how transportable they are. 
[02:06:00]  And they're just showing bombs and missiles and all kinds of fun shit.  Bunker Busters.  Great shows on the Military Channel.  Right on.  One of my faves now.  All right.  Uh, I think we're going to change gears.  We had intern David stop by on Friday to say hi to everybody.  Is that who that was?  That was David.  Oh, a lot of people were asking me over the weekend, you know, why didn't you tell us who it was? 
[02:06:30]  And then when I said David, they were like, stop.  Didn't even sound like him.  No one got it.  It was weird.  Not one person got it right.  Who's that fucking Rutger Hauer?  Oh, no.  It's Ted Danson.  Oh, my God.  What's with Ted Danson?  I'm a goo.  You've done it again.  White wig.  Wow.  God, you realize how long ago Cheers was?  God, Ted Danson, he's sitting cross like, what a long-legged asshole.  Yeah.  He's got fucking spider monkey legs.  Lanky guy. 
[02:07:00]  He's wearing big Coke bottle lenses and his glasses.  Yeah.  What happened?  They look like shot glasses from Cheers, the bar.  Oh, come on now.  You pick that up.  You can see Kirstie Alley's twat.  Oh, you pick her bunt up.  Let's go to Jason in Columbus.  Jason.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, Ant, have you seen this show on Spike called Deadliest Warrior?  We had the guy on.  Oh, okay.  And we promised him that we'd watch his show, and I think I forgot.  It was pretty good. 
[02:07:30]  They had like a marathon.  Like one I saw was the IRA versus the Taliban, and they get guys who like are either ex-IRA  or descendants, stuff like that.  It was kind of interesting.  I heard the show was really good.  Yeah.  They do a bunch of like different scientific tests.  They did Mafia versus the Yakuza.  The sling blade?  Mm-hmm.  Well, that's all I got.  You did the boy.  Sorry.  We like how you talk.  I like how you talk.  You had a little...  I don't know. 
[02:08:00]  Thanks, guys.  All right, feller.  All right, Jason.  Mm-hmm.  That's funny.  He goes, mm-hmm.  We're actually giving him a compliment, I think.  Yeah, I know.  We kind of like that.  Yeah.  Backstage with ONA.  So you had intern David stop by Friday.  Bobo was here.  Bobo comes by every Friday hoping for a little...  Some air time.  Some air time.  Yeah.  Most of the time, he just sits down the hall.  Yeah.  And then we'd walk by him and say, hey, have a good weekend.  For hours, by the way.  He sits down at the end of the hall and, yeah, he gets a, hey, Bobo, what's up? 
[02:08:30]  Mm-hmm.  Well, I was at the...  No, I didn't mean what's up.  I just mean hi.  Don't tell me anything.  Mm-hmm.  So, uh, I guess David and Bobo...  Bobo.  Bobo.  Wait, David and Bob.  No, it's gotta be Bobo, right?  David and Bobo argue about pants.  It's gotta be Bobo.  Hope so.  We'll find out.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  And the other day, former Opie and Anthony intern David and show weirdo Bobo were wandering 
[02:09:00]  around the Sirius XM compound for no apparent reason.  Nobody was sure how or why they were allowed in the building, but we were able to eavesdrop  on an in-depth conversation that they were having.  Now, you were just laughing hysterically a minute ago.  What's so funny?  It said Sean John on Bobo's jeans, and I thought that was hilarious.  Why is that hilarious?  Because Bobo is who he is, and there's only a certain genre of people, I don't mean to 
[02:09:30]  be stereotypical or rude, but there's only a certain genre of people that wear Sean John  clothes, and Bobo's wearing Sean John clothes.  Bobo's a short little nerdy white kid, and he's wearing Sean John jeans.  I don't know if you could say short or medium.  What are you laughing at now?  Well, not only is Bobo wearing Sean John jeans, he's wearing Sean John jeans with the  zipper, the fly, unzipped.  Oh, jeez, Bobo.  Is that true?  I guess maybe he must have left it unzipped the last time I went to the bathroom. 
[02:10:00]  When was that?  A while ago.  We left them to their devices for a while, but after a half hour, we came back and found  David and Bobo still arguing about pants.  Who gave you permission to wear black man's clothes, Bobo?  I think Fubu would be considered more of a black thing than Sean John is.  Sean John is black, Bobo.  You're wearing...  Bobo, are you stealing Sean John's clothes, Bobo?  No, I'm not stealing short, puffy clothes, Joe.  I don't go to his house in a half to say, 
[02:10:30]  Oh, puffy, I'm going to steal your clothes.  And he comes out with a gun and I'm running from Sean...  A gun?  Bobo, I didn't mean to get violent on here with a gun.  And I'm taking a...  And I'm stealing a car from the Hamptons.  I'm not playing Grand Theft Auto with Sean Puffy Combs' car.  David, what on earth is he talking about?  I don't know.  What the fuck are you talking about, Bobo?  What I was saying is that it wasn't designated for black people, right?  I've seen white people wearing Sean John shirts. 
[02:11:00]  I've seen people wearing Sean John jeans.  Bobo, you're not a black man, Bobo.  Hearing David and Bobo discuss fashion trends and racial theory  in such an academic and educated way was inspiring, to say the least.  We still don't know how they got in the building,  but we can only hope that they got hit by some sort of bus on the way out.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with O&A.  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy from Jamaica. 
[02:11:30]  Jamaica.  The island or in Queens?  I'm going to go...  I'm going to say Queens.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, that sucks.  Hey, boys, the show's going great.  I'm currently listening to the show naked.  I've asked around O&A forums, and a lot of people say they listen to the show naked.  Nude.  Pretty weird.  Yeah.  You think there are girls listening to us naked right now?  Yeah.  Really?  Definitely.  Big, fat girls are listening naked. 
[02:12:00]  Yep.  And the hot ones, their vaginas are fucking drying up like they just got sugar cookies  and Navy SEAL training.  Yeah.  We're repulsive.  iPhone.  iPhone.  The, uh, what?  Apple's going to announce the new iPhone today?  Some kind of big announcement.  I can't stand that they fucking dragged this shit out.  I'm listening, and it's like, I'm listening to the news, and Apple today is going to make  a big announcement concerning their iPhone.  And they already made the announcement of the 3.0 version on their website. 
[02:12:30]  You can go there and check it out and see the features and everything.  But now, it's like, oh, now they're going to make the announcement.  It's like, what announcement?  How about you just put the fucking thing out so I can go down there and buy it?  I actually know what they're going to do to make this, because the phone service has  been a little iffy.  So they're going to hand out strings that people can do like the old days with the tin  cans.  Oh, is there going to be an attachment you can plug into the bottom, and it's just  a piece of twine?  But how are we going to walk around Manhattan, Jimmy?  We're going to be running into everyone's string.  Well, again. 
[02:13:00]  Literal O.P.  Well, you know.  What?  You're not wrong.  And then they're going to have the apology app.  So every time you can't get service, you press it, and the little voice goes, I'm sorry.  We took the deal.  We shouldn't have.  It's the apology.  I still have no desire to buy the iPhone, my friends.  Most people in media, you're left in the dust.  They have their iPhones.  I like my BlackBerry.  Left in the dust.  You like your what?  My BlackBerry.  I don't say it the weird way anymore.  Why?  Because it got old.  It's a BlackBerry. 
[02:13:30]  No.  So there's something big coming out for that.  I don't know.  What's the 3.0 doing?  Oh, my God.  It does everything.  Like what?  Yeah.  Can you download your fucking notes from your thing?  It just is amazing.  They will have cut and paste.  They will have, I believe, video.  Are we looking at video?  On the new phone.  Yes.  I'm not talking about just 3.0, my friend.  What are you talking about video?  Fuck people downloading shit to their old phones.  I'm talking the new phone that's coming out.  I could see video on mine. 
[02:14:00]  Sure.  My BlackBerry does, too.  I could take out my flip phone and fucking make video.  No, I'm not even talking about making.  You can't watch video clips on your iPhone?  Oh, no.  I can watch them.  What are you talking about video?  I can't make them.  Oh, you can't make.  What?  I can't take video.  I know.  No, dude.  If you crack it and you fucking do this and make it void.  What is it called?  Null and void.  Jailbreaker or whatever the fuck the term is.  If you jailbreak it.  Okay.  No, I don't want to do that.  I had no idea you can't do that.  Like the BlackBerry, I can make just dumb primitive videos. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  I can't do that.  Why?  I have to take a fuckload of pictures all at once and put them together.  And then you flip through them like a book with a bunch of iPhones.  You guys drank the Kool-Aid.  No!  It's a great phone!  Yeah, but they're making you buy a new one every freaking three months.  I don't care.  Then they add the video.  Then they'll add something else they should have had on the one you already have.  There's going to be a hard drive space.  All right.  Why don't they do that right out of the gate?  Because they have to do things.  No, because they want you to buy about five or six phones within two years. 
[02:15:00]  You're right.  Oh, look at all my apps.  And it worked.  I understand, you know, they want you to keep buying their product, but they're ridiculous.  You don't understand.  What if you...  Why don't you have a video camera on there, really?  They will.  Every phone has a video camera.  It will on the next phone.  Yeah, but the iPhone was supposed to be the big, you know...  They wanted to get it out with all the goodness it had in it right away.  So they did that.  They held this shit back knowing that you would keep buying new phones. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, because why would you fucking not do that if you were a business man?  Come out with some new shit.  It gets to a point, though.  I understand, but it gets to a point where the word greed comes into play.  I fucking love it.  How many iPhones have you bought so far?  This is just my second one because the first one fell on the pool.  That's the only reason?  When I got pushed in the pool.  That's the only reason?  Only reason.  Same thing.  I really haven't come up with it.  All right.  The new iPhone, can you just download the new software or you got to go and just buy a whole  other phone?  No, I get the new iPhone.  I go home.  I plug it into the little dock and all the shit from this one goes right into the new 
[02:16:00]  one.  Right.  But why can't you just keep the phone you got and just upgrade that?  Because the new phone has a bigger hard drive in it or bigger flash drive, whatever the  fuck is in here, and the video camera capability.  Right.  Okay.  And a video camera on the front so you could do video conferencing as you look at the  screen and do things like that.  So when's the 3.0 coming out and when's the new phone?  Go.  3.0 comes out, they're speculating the end of the month, and the new phone comes out 
[02:16:30]  in 2,385, I believe, way in the future.  That's fucking bullshit, dude.  Oh.  Yeah, I know.  That's confrontational, Jim.  Any info on that, Mr. Fucking High Tech Travis?  End of the month.  Same thing.  Same thing.  End of the month.  Well, that's the rumor.  They'll release the phone and the software for the thing.  Yeah, and I really need it.  Did you just say, did you just talk to Travis?  Yeah.  I don't acknowledge Travis.  What?  I don't either, but.  Because you got your Tiger Woods ahead of me, you motherfucker. 
[02:17:00]  He put AIDS in my jacuzzi.  What are you talking about?  I didn't get Tiger Woods, yeah.  How's your boo-boo on your front?  It comes out today, right?  Yeah, it comes out today.  Oh, well, I will have it before you.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  I bought mine online, so I got to wait for shipping.  I want to play today, but I think I'll get it by Thursday, the new Tiger Woods.  I'll tell you how it is.  What do you know about the new Tiger Woods there, Travis?  Real-time weather.  Yeah, I heard that.  I knew that one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So if you're playing a course and it happens to be raining on that course, wherever the  fuck the course really is, it rains in the game. 
[02:17:30]  That's pretty cool.  That is pretty cool.  They pulled that with the Microsoft Flight Simulator.  They do that with the flight?  Which is great.  You put real-time weather on, and you go for your little flight between two cities, and  it's the real weather.  I like that.  I was going the other day from Brazil.  I was flying to France.  You're still doing flight similars?  Oh.  Oh.  Duh.  Stupid me.  Real-time weather.  What do we know on that plane crash?  They're finding bodies in the ocean, which I find amazing that they're able to find the  bodies.  I know.  Well, they wash up every so often. 
[02:18:00]  They're not washing up yet.  No, they're in the middle of the ocean, bro.  In the middle of the ocean.  They'll probably wash up there eventually, right?  Ah.  Like some Brazilian will be on the beach and go like, ah.  Yeah, maybe a fingernail by the time it hits shore.  Exactly.  All the fish go nibbling.  What happened with that flight?  What are they saying now, Ann?  You're a big flight guy.  Oh, now it's a problem maybe with a frozen pitted tube.  A frozen pitted tube.  What is a pitted tube?  And they've been installing new pitted tubes before this happened on these planes. 
[02:18:30]  So the pitted tube is a little tube that extends out.  Wait, a pitted tube could cause a plane crash?  Yeah, especially on autopilot.  Because it's the thing that tells the plane and tells you how fast the plane is going,  what the air speed is.  It's a little tube that literally is sticking out from the front of the plane that the air  goes in.  And it measures how quickly you're going through the air, your air speed, not your ground speed, 
[02:19:00]  your air speed.  So if you're going too slow, it alerts the autopilot or the pilot that you're going too  slow and that you're not going fast enough to keep your plane in the air.  And you might crash.  So they're saying that might have froze up.  Jesus.  Because they were in these thunderclouds that these updrafts were ridiculous.  The top of a thunderstorm, very cold usually.  And they're going through it and it could have froze up and given them an inaccurate reading. 
[02:19:30]  They had something like 20 messages being beamed back that all kinds of systems were fucking  up.  So that could be it.  But they won't know unless they get the black box or they could, they could look at some  of the evidence and know if the plane blew up, if they see like charred remains, shit  like that, or, you know, know if the plane hit, broke up before it hit, broke up when  it hit the water, things like that.  They could kind of figure out by getting debris, but until they get the box, they really can't 
[02:20:00]  figure out exactly what happened.  So that's, that's where they are with that one.  But bodies say bodies coming up.  A few lucky family members going to be able to actually bury some loved ones and have  some place to, I must fuck them up though.  And they just look out in the ocean and go, eh, they're floating out there somewhere getting  eaten.  Of course.  Still can't send picture texts with the new iPhone.  Let's say hi to Larry.  Larry, I thought you could.  Hey, yeah, I just wanted to say, I've got a BlackBerry, just like Opie, and the big 
[02:20:30]  problem with the iPhone is you can't send picture text messages.  Yeah, I think that's going to be resolved.  That will be resolved.  You will be able to text.  But they could have done that a year ago.  That's, that's the point I'm making today.  There's a lot of...  One of my biggest gripes, Opie.  There's a lot of greed there.  They, they, they had that technology.  They held that back.  So you keep buying, you know, more and more updates and versions of the phone.  I hear you.  That's greed, my friend.  Well, you know who texts it?  It's John Q. Public. 
[02:21:00]  Have a good day, gentlemen.  You can laugh, but we're not laughing, sir.  That's right, sir.  All right.  It's tragic.  Let's go to Hugh in Texas.  Hugh.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up, man?  Hey.  Happy birthday, GME.  Thank you, Hugh.  Thank you, Hugh.  I'm comfortable to say that.  Hugh, hold on, Hugh, hold on, hold on, hold on, Hugh, you've been trumped for nudity.  Let's say hi to Katie in Poughkeepsie.  Oh.  Katie.  Good evening.  So we have that guy in Jamaica saying that he listens to the show naked, and now you're 
[02:21:30]  saying you listen to the show naked.  Well, I have the boom box in my living room, and I'm getting ready right now.  I'm going bridal dress shopping, and I'm changing, and I hear you guys talk about women being  naked, and it was totally weird just to be naked listening to you wondering if women  were listening to you naked at that moment.  It was so weird.  Katie's naked, everyone.  So you're naked?  Like, what are you doing?  Just kind of laying in bed?  No, I was in my closet trying on clothes to wear to go bridal shopping. 
[02:22:00]  Bridal shopping?  You girls are messed up.  So you're trying on clothes, so you look good, so you can try on other clothes.  Well, yeah.  It's kind of a high-end place, so I want it to look nice.  No, I...  You have to have the certain accessories so you can see how it might look with your dress.  You have to wear the certain undergarments so that way you could, you know...  What do you look like, Katie?  Oh, boy. 
[02:22:30]  Um...  Yeah.  5'3".  5'3".  Tiny.  Tiny.  Are you petite, or are you a big, fat 5'3"?  Either way...  Definitely not big, fat 5'3".  Okay, cool.  Little.  I'm not too little.  I'm right on spot.  How much do you weigh?  It's cool either way.  Um, about 128.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Opie.  It's not going to help her self-esteem. 
[02:23:00]  Maybe she had big double D's on that little frame.  Yeah, we...  You have to be more girl-friendly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you're very sexy, Katie.  Yeah.  I am.  Jason, Pennsylvania.  Jason.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Yeah, well, with the, uh, well, with the pitot tube reader thing, what they're saying  now is that, um, in those storms, if it was given a false reading, if they're going  too slow, the protocol is to speed up, where if it's given an inaccurate reading, the plane 
[02:23:30]  would have too much G-force and would just totally shred the plane, and if it was in  the reverse order, the plane would have just basically dropped out of the sky, sort  of thinking they sped up and the G-force is torn apart.  Wow.  I heard it went too slow and, uh, kind of stalled, and, uh, when you stall in a storm,  oof, a little hard to recover.  I heard they were going at a medium pace, Ant.  Medium?  Mm-hmm.  That's perfect.  Oh, it is?  Your porridge is perfect. 
[02:24:00]  Oh.  Oh, shit.  But wait, if they go to high, if the high-rate is, how fast do they have to go for the G-force  to rip the plane apart?  8,000 miles an hour.  Oh, slower than that.  But, I mean, they go, like, 550, 600 miles an hour.  How fast do you think these guys were going?  There's an overspeed.  The thing is, you can't accelerate one of those planes and get enough G-forces to rip  it apart.  Right.  It won't do it with the acceleration of that plane.  You can get enough, um, wind resistance over the wings to rip the fucking wings off if you 
[02:24:30]  go into a dive and go up to, you know, uh, 700 miles an hour.  If you get right below the, uh, sound barrier, uh, you're going to rip the fucking wings off  or the tail will come off on that plane, apparently.  Those planes, ooh, that fucking fiber tail.  Mm-hmm.  It's on the Iberfay Altae.  Really?  Yeah, like a nice piece of aluminum, aluminum, like the Boeings use.  I like that fucking carbon fiber tail.  Do you know how awful a sound that must be?  Wings ripping off? 
[02:25:00]  Oh, and then you just know there's no, you know.  Of course not.  Plus it's raining.  You look out the window and go, maybe he can land it with no wings.  No.  You can't.  Cabin pressure went out, too, which is probably merciful because it kind of passed out.  Oh, yeah, it probably passed out, yeah.  30 seconds or something?  Would you put the mask on?  Would you just go like, you know something, fuck that, I'm passing out.  Must get over here.  I ain't put the mask on.  I don't want to.  I don't want to put the mask on.  Just land.  It's just horrendous.  I'm just hoping I'll pass out and then when I wake up, the people will be going, 
[02:25:30]  could you wake up, Mr. Camilla?  Here you go, we've made it to the airport.  It's just a dream.  Oh, it's a dream.  What?  There's a pile of shit in your pants.  Ho, ho, ho, the devil's out the door poking your ass at the pitchfork.  Ooh, Stalker Patty's naked, listen.  Because you've been bad.  Stalker Patty's naked listening to the show right now.  Ah.  Nice, right?  Hot.  Good.  I hope at the coroner's office.  She has a fucking, she has a little toe tag on, on that fucking hammer toe. 
[02:26:00]  Ew, Jesus.  It's the same type of rope that Carradine hung himself with.  Can we get Sam down the hall because something's going on in pop culture.  I thought it was a who gives a shit story, but they're doing a lot on this on the news today.  Like, this Heidi from I'm a celebrity, get me out of here?  Yeah.  What the fuck's going on?  Heidi?  Heidi's from what?  The Hills or something?  Oh, yeah.  What's she doing?  Some kind of fucking scandal with her and her.  Spencer?  Heidi and Spencer, I guess?  Spencer.  Sam, what do you know on this Heidi broad?  I mean, this show, I'm a celebrity, get me the fuck out of here is a pretty popular show, huh? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, it's a good show.  No, it's not.  Well, it hasn't been good since Spidey left.  Who's Spidey?  Spencer and Heidi.  Oh, God.  Have we, have we reached a point where we don't have to combine two names of, of people?  Just enough already.  Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag.  Spidey.  Spidey.  No, it's just Heidi.  Spidey, like Spider-Man.  Yeah, kind of.  Except it's S-P-whatever, E-I-D-I. 
[02:27:00]  I don't care.  Spidey.  What happened with this thing?  People are watching this show.  Yeah.  I don't know why John Sally would agree to do this show.  He does stand-up, too.  He's a very talented guy.  What is he doing on a show like that?  Spencer Pratt's very talented as well.  Fuck no.  But they, yeah, they, you know, they're trapped in the jungle and everything.  They're not trapped in the jungle.  They got to stay in there.  They're, they're on a Club Med somewhere.  Yeah.  They're just keeping the other people away for a few weeks.  Let's be real here.  Spidey thought they were going to.  What jungle are they trapped in? 
[02:27:30]  I don't know which, which one it is.  I bet you're right on the other side of the freaking, uh, camera is a Hilton.  It's the Costa Rican jungle.  Or Ritz-Carlton.  Oh, is it?  Probably a Ritz-Carlton.  Yeah.  They got big spiders and, uh.  Spideys?  Stevie Baldwin got, uh.  Stevie Baldwin?  He got bit by, uh, like a spider or something.  Yeah.  What happened to him?  Did he die?  No, he ended up okay.  But, I mean, still, it's not pleasant.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, these guys are big celebrities.  They're not used to this kind of treatment.  Hence the title.  Exactly. 
[02:28:00]  That's the appeal.  So you brought in some audio of, uh, Heidi and Spencer.  Yeah.  Spidey.  And they, they're quitting, and now I'm hearing Heidi's, like, suing NBC because of her treatment.  For what?  What the fuck's going on, Sam?  Well, they kept quitting and then not quitting.  I don't know exactly what their status is on the show.  Because when we left last week, they were thinking about going back on.  Oh.  Even though they quit, like, three times already.  But, is it a live show?  Yes.  Oh, it is?  Well, it's live, and they go to pre-taped stuff.  Like, they pre-taped the challenges, and then, uh, what's his name? 
[02:28:30]  Our buddy Damien Fahey is the host.  Yeah, Damien's a cool guy.  Yeah.  We like him, but the show sucks.  I, well, it sucks without Spidey, I'll say that.  Isn't it Survivor?  It's kind of like Survivor, but it looks like Survivor, right?  Yeah, it's like an easy version of Survivor, right?  They're celebrities, though.  Not for these shows.  But they're not.  I saw the lineup.  Who's a celebrity?  John Sally is.  Frangela.  Who?  The comedy duo.  Oh, that does.  Best week ever? 
[02:29:00]  Yes, except...  Two big black broads, right?  One of them got voted off, though.  Wait, wait.  Frangela?  Frangela.  Is that two people?  It's Francis and Angela.  Look.  No more!  See, you and I, we need kind of a combined name, because that's the new thing.  Oh.  They go on stage as Frangela?  Anthopy.  No, I don't like that.  Oh, Panthony.  No, stop already.  But that's got...  Granthony.  Opany.  Opany.  Opany? 
[02:29:30]  Opany is good.  That's what people say.  Opany.  They get it all wrong when they say that.  Is this audio worth playing?  Sure.  Someone's saying...  Samgit.  Someone's saying the iPhone stuff is a free download, but you're not going to get the video  camera unless you get the new phone.  Right.  The 3.0 is a free download.  Yeah.  You get the phone, you get the download.  But, if you get the new phone...  We are...  How...  It's all coming together.  A year from now, camera, video camera, phone. 
[02:30:00]  Yep.  Right now, like, video camera on my BlackBerry, primitive.  Yeah.  So I still have to carry my flip around.  Flip is great.  Right.  But it's all coming together, finally.  It is all coming together.  What do we got, another year?  I mean, my...  I got...  See, that's why you...  My camera's a 3.2 megapix.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  But it needs to be a little higher, right?  But that's where you don't get it.  You beat up the iPhone.  It's more than the video, the camera, and the phone.  That's right. 
[02:30:30]  It's the lousy service.  You know something?  My AT&T service is no better or worse than every other service I've ever had, and I've  had every single one.  I've had Sprint.  I've had Verizon.  I've had them all.  Ant really has never had a problem with his cell phone service.  My fucking...  Occasionally, I'll be talking, and it'll cut out.  No, and I'll be like, fuck, I have no single.  But it's happened with every phone I've ever owned.  No.  But I can't say it's awful.  I know what direction you're going in, but I just got to say, I'm not saying BlackBerry  over the iPhone or anything like that.  I'm just talking about technology in general. 
[02:31:00]  We're about a year away from having those three things in one.  All good.  Right.  All really good, where you don't have to shop around for a video camera anymore or a nice digital  camera.  It's all going to be right there for you.  Well, let me inform you.  One thing you throw in your pocket.  Nice.  On what's happening with the iPhone, it's taking away from a lot of gaming companies.  These apps, the games that are coming out for the iPhone...  Are they getting better?  ...are very good.  The graphics even look great.  They're fun little entertaining games.  I mean, it's not like looking on a big monitor and having the inputs that you do when you 
[02:31:30]  have a keyboard and a mouse, but for a lot of people...  How does it compare to the PSP?  Very comparable.  For real.  There's some great fucking games.  Have you played the PSP?  Sims 3.  Yeah.  Yeah.  PlayStation Portable.  And you're saying it's comparable?  Yes.  Wow.  I didn't know that.  And I think it's just going to get better.  The size of the screen is a little too small.  But Sims 3 is an app for the iPhone, and it's getting raves.  I mean, you could do everything you could do on Sims 3 on this app version. 
[02:32:00]  Anyone playing that Sims 3?  I got it.  A few people, yeah.  You got it, Sam?  Not for the phone, the computer version.  I'm a Sim.  Yeah, I like the Sims.  I kind of liked the first one that came out.  But it gives you a little more input on what you're doing during off hours in the old  game when it used to be like off hours.  Yeah.  You could still do that.  Socialize, online play, shit like that.  Yeah.  What makes it cool, though, Sims 3?  Well, I mean, the graphics are a little boosted.  They're kind of the same as the Sims 2, but there's more little things you can do. 
[02:32:30]  You can control the details better.  Yeah.  So you can make characters that kind of really look like you.  So it's not that much different than Sims 2 after all this time?  Well, yeah, it's different.  I mean, I haven't played the Sims 2 in a long time.  I gave up on the Sims 2, and then I picked up the Sims 3.  He hasn't immersed himself in it yet.  All right, so Heidi and Spencer, I'm a celebrity.  Get me the fuck out of here.  Spidey.  You say Spidey, so people know.  Thanks.  Is this audio worth playing you brought in a few days ago?  Yeah.  This is the big blow-up they had to get off this island?  And these reality shows, they used to be six months.  Now they're, I think we've talked about this, a month. 
[02:33:00]  Not even.  This one's three weeks.  That's a nice vacation.  That's a great vacation.  They do a four nights a week for three weeks.  Four nights?  It's on Monday through Thursday.  So the other three nights are in a hotel.  Hotel.  Get their shit back together.  Well, we'll find out.  This sucks.  I gotta watch tonight, see what the weekend recap happened.  If they're only going live on TV four nights a week, that means there's a hotel nearby,  and they're getting spa treatments and fucking shampoo and hair and shit.  But Sanjaya had to fight to make sure he got there. 
[02:33:30]  What the fuck is Sanjaya?  From American Idol?  Remember that guy?  Yeah.  I did.  He's not a celebrity.  He's one of these celebrities.  He's not a celebrity?  Yeah.  Boy, they really had a tough time finding people, didn't they?  They got Lou Diamond Phillips.  Lou Diamond Phillips has the most tragic story in Hollywood ever.  King of the sci-fi, made for a sci-fi channel movie.  Let me tell you why.  Lou Diamond Phillips is the most tragic figure in Hollywood.  And you know some of this, but I don't know if you know it all.  His wife leaves him for Melissa Etheridge. 
[02:34:00]  Goes Lesbo.  Goes Lesbo.  Then she's bored with Melissa Etheridge and goes back to cock.  But not his cock.  Who?  Huh?  Who's cock?  You know?  No, no, no.  I'm asking, do you know?  No.  She had to cleanse the palate a little bit.  She went Lesbo and then back to cock.  And poor Lou Diamond Phillips is in a jungle getting bit by spiders now.  Tori Wilson's on the show, too.  She's pretty hot.  She doesn't have to do that, though.  She was a big star. 
[02:34:30]  Was a big star.  She left wrestling.  She fell, huh?  I love the wrestlers that think they can make it after their time is done.  That's what Chyna did.  She thought she could still be a big star.  Well, she got kicked out because Triple H was banging the boss's daughter.  So they had to get rid of the ex.  I don't know anything about that.  Oh, yeah.  I think Triple H would even admit it at this point.  Here's some audio from I'm a Celebrity.  Get me the fuck out of here.  You just thought it would be easier?  I don't know. 
[02:35:00]  I mean, I cannot not have sex with you for that long.  If you weren't here, I would already laugh.  I feel like I could do this for so long if there was s'mores and maybe another change of clothes.  But this is just almost borderline real torture.  Like, I would do this to Al-Qaeda.  That's Heidi.  That's when Spencer and Heidi, that's the first night.  She does know that Al-Qaeda, they live in caves and they haven't seen shit in years, right? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  They haven't had a real meal in years.  They're eating basically dirt and bugs.  They had just arrived at the camp.  So they had been in the jungle for like three, four hours already.  Oh my God.  But the younger people are eating this shit up.  Why?  I love Spidey.  Why?  They're very entertaining.  No, they're not.  Spencer talks to the show producer.  Why?  Yeah, because they've been there three hours.  Yeah, but then he gets on the phone.  Weren't they listening when someone sat him down and said, this is what the show is all about? 
[02:36:00]  No.  After three hours, they're like, what the fuck did I get myself into?  They thought there would be some s'mores.  Yo.  Spencer.  Tell me, tell me what's bothering you right now.  Just tell me what's, what's driving you.  I love the dramatic music.  Spencer.  Tim, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  What's driving you not?  I'm too, I'm too rich and I'm too famous to be sitting with these people and cleaning up their shit in the jungle, my man. 
[02:36:30]  And this cast is devaluing our fame right now.  I'm sitting next to VH1 comedians that I've never even seen before.  I'm sitting next to wrestlers.  I'm like, this is just not the show.  I thought it was about to be all celebrities.  Stars of shows get treated like stars, dude.  I'm supposed to be cleaning up John Sally's in a bucket, dude.  You've never cleaned up your own, let alone taking John Sally's to the creek.  Have you?  Don't throw me in the jungle and try to make me a little guinea pig, torture act. 
[02:37:00]  Enjoy your dinner.  Thanks so much for this opportunity.  I really appreciate it.  Probably not coming.  This motherfucker.  John Sally's way more famous than Spencer Pratt.  Way more famous.  What reality show was John Sally on?  A reality show called the NBA.  Spencer was on the Hills.  Yeah, good for him.  The Hills.  Yeah.  Gives a shit.  What a fucking asshole.  Are we supposed to think this about him?  Is that his gimmick?  Yeah, is he supposed to be?  Is that his gimmick? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, he runs gimmicks, but I don't think, like, he doesn't think them through.  Like, they don't have payoffs.  So I think he truly is a dickhead.  A dickhead.  I think he's a dickhead.  And what, John Sally takes a monster shit in a bucket and he has to bring it down to the creek?  I'd watch that, actually.  John Sally's a big dude.  Just all that roughage that he's eating in the jungle. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, big nasty fucking shit.  We should start a reality show just called Take My Shit to the Creek.  That's all it is, is taking big dumps and buckets and making someone bring it down to the creek.  What else we got here, Sam?  Heidi now cries because Tori Wilson made fun of her after she thought Heidi quit?  Well, yeah, because then they left and they thought that the other castmates thought that Spidey had quit.  But then Spidey came, and so they started using all their stuff. 
[02:38:30]  And, like, Tori Wilson started spraying Heidi's hair, spraying her hair and making fun of her.  But then Spidey came back and caught all the people making fun of him.  And I guess she hurt Heidi's feelings.  Jim, are you into this?  No.  Look at the look you've got.  I'm trying to find an angle on this, to be honest with you.  This is what they eat up, though.  It's on every freaking TV channel this morning.  It's what the kids are talking about.  Jokes are fun and funny, but when they're at the expense of someone, they're just mean. 
[02:39:00]  Like, I don't joke about people like that because it's just mean and it's malicious.  It's hard.  I just don't know why they're such mean people.  And Tori's saying she's this Christian and, you know, born again and blah, blah, blah.  But it's like, Christians don't do that, people.  You're supposed to be nice, and I have really bad bug bites.  This is not a very nice show.  Well, not.  This show is great, but.  Ah, look at her. 
[02:39:30]  These people are not turning out to be very nice.  And this was after a few hours, right, Sam?  Right, yeah.  Bug bites after a few hours.  And they had already quit, and then they came back.  Right.  It's about winning.  That was hysterical, honey.  Don't doubt it.  It's the first time you're crying on TV.  It's not fake.  Oh, shit.  He just kind of exposed that the hills was completely fake.  Like, she cries on the hills, but it's all fake crying.  But the people on the hills don't generally admit to the hills being fake. 
[02:40:00]  They, everyone, it's like wrestling.  No one thought the hills was real.  What are you talking about?  No one fucking thought the hills was real.  You put that, and I never watched it.  I saw, like, the trailers for it, and was like, this is so scripted.  It's fucking 90210.  So what does it have to do with wrestling?  It's fake.  Wrestling's fake.  What?  It's fake.  It's not fake.  They really do throw each other around in the ring and everything like that.  But it's not, Vince never got hurt.  Yeah, well, he did. 
[02:40:30]  His car never exploded.  I saw it explode.  Yeah, that's not true.  Oh, my God.  Speaking of wrestling, we had a sheriff on the line earlier.  He hung up, though.  Yeah.  Jake the Snake arrested overnight.  I ain't hear that.  Spent some time in his local jail.  What did he do?  I don't know if it's true, but if that guy could call back, we wanted to get to you,  but you hung up.  I would guess drunkenness of some sort.  Yes.  It was either a typo or is there something called OMI?  OMI as far as what?  I mean, or OWI?  Yeah, there's like operating a vehicle while intoxicated. 
[02:41:00]  Operating while intoxicated.  What's the difference then?  They have the same thing.  Some of them are DUI.  Some are DWI.  Some are OUWI.  Yeah, I guess each state or something has a different.  Maybe that guy will call back.  OUI, operating under the influence.  Yeah, that's right.  Okay.  I never heard that one before.  He was doing surgery.  Spencer has now decided he's here to win.  Yes, he changed his mind after quitting twice, and then now he's going to win. 
[02:41:30]  You got to realize, I'm a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  I kick box.  I box every day.  I don't fear it.  No, man.  Oh, Spencer.  Please don't leave, Spencer.  Oh, I'm not.  I've worked some things out.  Well, I mean, I came in here with an original plan that just got so shut down.  I wanted to leave yesterday and be the first one.  It's like, Heidi and Spencer quit first day.  God, I hate Heidi and Spencer.  That's exactly what I thought they would do.  They're exactly who I think they are, but they're not going to help me.  You damn sure got the audience thinking that. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, so I decided if I leave, I let all of these people that I don't even really know  have an opportunity to win.  I am here to win now.  Win what?  The contest.  What's the contest?  You get to win money for charity.  You got to outwit, outlast, outsurvive.  But the audience...  Club Med?  No, no, no.  They're in the jungle in Costa Rica.  I am lost.  I have no fucking clue what this show is about. 
[02:42:30]  What's going on.  I think I wanted to play this just to get everyone...  Except the two-name thing.  In a frenzy.  Just annoyed.  Well, because you guys have brought up this show before without...  And I wanted everybody...  We said, what a dumb show we'll never talk about on our program.  Spiney and Frangelica?  Spidey and Frangela.  Whatever.  Frangela.  There's Frangela, the big two black monsters.  Except the one with the yellow thing on her head is gone now.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  What will happen?  MTV does a marathon on Sundays in case you miss it during the week. 
[02:43:00]  You catch it on the weekend.  All the episodes.  So I'm all caught up.  Jimmy, why aren't you watching this?  I just...  I couldn't...  It's not even possible to care less.  Look how bad you are.  Really?  If something happened where they all died...  Except for John Sally.  I probably wouldn't even know about it.  I'm a big fan of John Sally.  Can we leave him out of the death scenario, please?  No.  And Spencer.  He's got to go...  No, no.  They all go...  I think we're all in agreement Spencer has to die.  If they all went...  What?  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  I think we'd have to say...  We'd have to say Tori, too.  I had a Spencer Pratt?  Hell, yeah.  Come on.  John Sally and Tori.  The rest of them.  Bye-bye.  Look at him yelling.  What is he doing?  He's letting people know.  He boxes every day.  He's a black belt.  Janice Dickinson is a old, dried-up whore.  She's a monster.  I fucking can't stand her.  Another monster.  She looks like a wax figure now.  She started stealing everybody's things.  And why was she crying?  I did see a clip where she was crying. 
[02:44:00]  With the girls crying on these fucking fake game shows.  John Sally said something?  I don't know.  It's a very difficult show for people.  They get very emotional.  Who's phony shit?  The celebrities.  The celebrities.  The people watching going,  What happened in my life that I'm interested in this shit?  No.  People are entertained.  And phony crap.  I like a good reality show, Sam.  Me too.  But they're getting out of control.  There's no reason to watch this.  Well, because you don't know what Spidey will do next.  That's a good point.  Yeah.  And then finally, night two.  Yeah.  That was all the first day. 
[02:44:30]  That was the first day.  This is the last clip, in case you're wondering out there.  On the second one, now they've done one challenge.  And Spencer had to do a challenge.  And he had to touch mice.  And so that was it for him.  That's the fucking challenge?  I don't want you to touch a mouse.  But it's dark, so you don't know what lurks around the corner.  Well, they're not going to put you in harm's way.  You don't know.  It's the jungle.  We can't even have a naked girl in studio pretty much at this point.  Do you think the lawyers are going to go,  All right, really fuck them up.  Put some poisonous snake in there. 
[02:45:00]  You're not factoring into account the unpredictability of the atmosphere they're in.  Dude, it's fraternity bullshit.  We were blindfolded.  We were told that an Ego took a shit in our fucking toilet.  And we had to get rid of it because we were the pledges.  You weren't in a jungle.  So we had to go in there.  And we had to squish that turd until it went down the toilet.  Getting rid of the sorority doo-doo.  I...  But it was a banana, see?  The old switcheroo.  I hate this show. 
[02:45:30]  No, you've got to watch that one.  And I've never seen it.  Can you watch one show?  I would never.  I would never even watch it if I had to.  Let's do a show thing where we all watch tonight and come back tomorrow and discuss.  It's on tonight, huh?  Yeah.  How about we just don't?  No.  Please tell me the Penguins are on tonight.  I don't know.  I'm really more concentrated on this thing.  Pens playing tonight, anyone?  I don't think they are, though.  Here's the last clip.  As much as us, Spidey is going to miss all of you.  And we've grown to love you all.  And I know we've said we're going to leave like ten times. 
[02:46:00]  That challenge has proved us we do not have what it takes.  So I think we're going to get out of here.  For real.  I'm a super celebrity.  My wife is a super celebrity.  Super celebrities don't belong in the jungle.  They belong in Hollywood with the paparazzi.  We will miss you guys.  So call us all when you get back to L.A.  Oh, what a great voice on that girl, too.  Is she Heidi?  Is she at least hot? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah, she is.  That could be the worst show I've ever heard.  Ever.  This is...  Yeah, horrid.  Ever.  I'd rather watch Archie Bunker's Place.  Ooh.  That was a bad one.  With Stephanie?  Oh, yeah.  She grew up to take her clothes off, didn't she?  Ooh, I...  Or barely.  Something like that.  I'd rather watch Aftermash.  Oof.  Okay, that's really bad.  But I'd rather watch that than this.  Really?  I'd rather watch that on fucking Blu-ray than this.  Blu-ray.  I like the Blu-ray. 
[02:47:00]  Sean in Albany.  Hey, hey, guys.  Hey.  Spencer yelling out how he has a black belt.  First off, he's been given that under a blackballed instructor, which means nobody will touch him.  What are you talking about?  He was a purple belt as of a month ago, and then all of a sudden jumped around into black,  which generally takes about four to five years for people that are doing it five times a week.  And he gets regularly dusted by blue belts, which is the level below a purple belt.  You know why he made the jump so quickly? 
[02:47:30]  Because he's Spencer Pratt, and that's how he gets down like that.  Have you seen this fake bar fight footage there?  Hmm?  Have you seen the footage out where he's supposedly in a bar fight?  That's not a sanctioned martial arts event.  That's a bar fight.  They have to put Lou Diamond Phillips actor underneath.  Did you see that?  Supposedly Letterman called out Spencer.  I don't know, but I'll find a clip.  Yeah, please do.  And what, this is the mouse they had to touch? 
[02:48:00]  Who cares?  Well, you got to put your hand in it, and you don't know what's in there.  It's the jungle, after all.  What could it be?  It's not the jungle.  That's a set, that's a fake set wall.  And it's a petting zoo.  And it's, yeah, they're little plastic tubes, like habit trails, with little fucking mice  that you would get your kids as pets.  What if they bite?  Who cares?  You're bitten.  They would just nibble.  Look how much pain Lou Diamond Phillips is in in this clip here.  Yeah, he's watching one of his movies.  And now they're playing Stand and Deliver.  Ow, ow. 
[02:48:30]  This is dumb.  There's no drama to it.  They're making, it's fake drama.  They're showing Lou Diamond's face.  He's cringing.  And now they're showing close up on the mice.  And then they show him again.  Then they show his arm in the hole.  Then they show the fuck.  Why is he cringing?  They're just nibbling a little, probably, right?  And their little mouse feet are moving around his hand.  And now what?  Tori's crying?  Those are jungle mice.  Why is he?  What's a jungle mice?  They're not jungle mice.  He's a white fucking lab rat, things. 
[02:49:00]  They're the safest mice you can get, style.  They're not even touching him.  They're not biting him.  Then why is he making that face then?  To make a face and make some drama.  Show the blood.  Show the blood from the tiny little mice.  I hate the interviews after they have to do.  Yeah.  To describe their harrowing events.  No, I was really, you know, at the time, I never thought I could do it.  And as I was doing it, shut up.  Who cares?  I was going out of that hole without the star.  Thank God the EMTs were on the scene.  Yeah, thank God, Sam.  They're just little nibbly mice. 
[02:49:30]  They're nothing.  I put my cock in that hole with cheese on it.  You know what?  For real, I think I would, too, Jimmy.  You guys should do a show.  Knowing what kind of mice they are, what the fuck are they going to do?  What are they going to do?  Let's say hi to Kevin in South Carolina.  Kevin.  Hey, man.  Hey.  I'm kind of wondering why we're talking about these stupid idiots while we could be criticizing  Britney's naked hair.  Yeah, Britney, I guess, got topless.  It's in the paper today. 
[02:50:00]  She was going to use it for something and decided at the last minute not to.  It was a video shoot.  It was a video shoot for one of her songs.  Where is the video?  That's all I want to know.  Well, the music video is out.  Not the music video, the video of her tits.  No, the still shots were in the paper this morning, right there.  All right, well, let's see them.  Uncensor that crap.  Yeah, you got to click on the bottom.  What would tylerdurndu.com?  W-W-T-D-D-D.com.  What's with the star?  That's how she did it.  That's how she did it on there.  What?  It was like pasties.  Like, she's a stripper or something. 
[02:50:30]  Give me a better one.  Jet Black Dew.  So fake tattoos for the video.  Give me a better one.  That's all you really get.  Give me a better one.  She's topless, but she's got kind of stars over the nipples.  She looks like, go back one with her body  She has a body like fucking Ozzy  Like 1981 right there  With the way the fucking arm is positioned with the tattoo on the forearm  Yeah, look at that  I bet you she chose, she saw what she looked like  And said, you know  This ain't happening  Fat forearms  Naked Britney is better than 
[02:51:00]  Fucking non-naked Britney  I guess  Yeah, but she should have got naked  Before the kids  They all fucking get naked  Too late  Too late, right Ant?  Too late  She is starting to get back into shape  Is she?  Yeah  No, she's not  Jared in Kansas  Jared  Okay  Hey, what's up guys?  There you go  Hey  I just wanted to call you  Hold on, hold on, hold on  We'll go back to you in a second  What do you think of that shot, Ant?  Alright  She's 
[02:51:30]  She's got muscle boobs  Yeah, yeah  You ever see girls with like muscle boobs?  There's a little too much on top  Too much meat on top  The nips aren't placed in that nice  Perky position  They're a little too low  Yeah, but they're not sagging  Because you must have got like implants  She did get implants  Are popping up the top part of the boot  Yeah, yeah  Making them muscly  I jam it in her face  Are you kidding?  Yeah  She's still fuckable  It's Britney Spears for God's sake 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, we know that  I'm going out on a limb saying I'd do her  Come on  Crazy  What am I talking about?  Jared  Yes, sir  Hey  Hey, I was just going to say  I had a little input  I was flipping through the channels the other night  And saw the show on  And I watched Spidey get baptized by Stephen Baldwin  Yeah  What's that about, Sam?  Well, before Spencer left the show  He felt like dirty  And so  He had Stephen Baldwin baptize him in a jungle lake  In a jungle lake? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah  That was the pool  No, no, no, no  Yeah, the pool  In between water volleyball  They said, you know what?  Make it a little muddy  So it looks like a swamp or a jungle lake  Heidi specifically  She specifically pointed out the lack of s'mores  So this is not a vacation spot  I am so annoyed you're still talking about this  It's horrendous  I want to beat you over the head  It's a hot show right now  No, it's not  You know what's funny about the whole thing?  We were talking about Navy SEAL training  And now we're talking about this  And she can't handle a night in the jungle  Yeah 
[02:53:00]  We run the gamut here on the Opie and Anthony show  It's true  Yes, we do  From good to suck  And I bet a lot of money after the day of, you know, shooting is over  They're like, that was good  That was a good shoot  We'll see you guys tomorrow  Go back to  We got a shuttle bus back to the Ritz-Carlton  All right  Thanks  Yep  And how about if she and I are arguing when you guys come  Yeah, I like that  I like that  Hey guys, you're going to put your hands through  But just really play it up  Like they're getting bitten  Look, these mice, they're not really, they're not going to touch you  Yeah  But you got to put your arm in there all the way 
[02:53:30]  We put the stars pretty far back for you to have to grab  So really strain and make it look like they're biting you  These mice have dentures  That's why Lou Diamond was cringing  He has efferent on his fingers  Little mousy mouthfuls of efferent  It's awful  Let's go to Adam  Adam  I guess this is our pop culture break  Adam  Hey, what's up boys  You guys got to check out  There's Sam's favorite person, Lady Gaga  There's a video that leaked out 
[02:54:00]  It's called for her new song, Paparazzi  Check out that standard bullshit  If you had that, you'd be fired  She's pretending to be paralyzed in a wheelchair  She's acting  She's playing a role here  Yeah, she's acting  I like that  It's on YouTube  What do we know about that, Sam?  It's the new music video for her new single, Paparazzi  Which for the record is my favorite song off the album  And it's going to be a huge hit  For whose record?  Why am I not?  I was keeping a record of that  Nobody  Yeah, no one asked you, Sam  I mean the album  The Lady Gaga stuff is a bit catchy 
[02:54:30]  But, you know, downloading it  And listening to it on your own  What are you doing?  Purchasing the CD  Purchasing it  That's stupid  It's an eight minute long music video  It's an epic  Oh, good  No, it's presumptuous  It's her November rain  Well, no, because the song is not eight minutes  It tells a story  What kind of story could it possibly tell?  It's like a Hollywood story  Oh, good  I hate videos like this  Or that fucking story  I just like seeing Jimmy annoyed 
[02:55:00]  Well, the stories are awful  Starring Lady Gaga  See?  Will there be some talking in the beginning?  Yes  But it's in French  Oh, good  Oh, great  What the fuck are we doing, Sam?  There's subtitles  Why is it in French?  Stylistically  Just zip through this, would you?  This is so stupid  Did you see the Lady Gaga dollars?  Yeah, her face on a $100 bill  Let me see  She and this guy are making out  I really dig that heavy black makeup on girls like that  Yeah, of course you do  No fucking punches 
[02:55:30]  I mean around the eyes  I mean blackface  That's just regular  Every time  You want to come  They yell mammy  And it spills out of you  That's just regular makeup, Ant  They're just crying  I like slut eyes like that  Yeah  That's great  See, she and this guy keep making out  There's a ram looking at them  Is she at all hot?  I can't tell  This has the sex appeal  Of a pickle commercial  Yeah  You know what it looks like?  It looks like one of these stupid perfume ads 
[02:56:00]  Yeah  Like you don't know what it is until they go  You know  This is a good video  Maybe Gaga  Is he going to take her now?  Is he going to put his penis in her vagina?  Throw her off the balcony  Just throw her the fuck off the balcony  Do you trust me?  Of course  Who wants to read?  It's just a weird looking thing  I don't feel like reading  Paparazzi taking pictures while they're having sex outside  Wait, but the guy's in on it  Oh, he's in on it?  She's saying stop  But he's not stopping  He's saying smile for the picture  Look in the camera 
[02:56:30]  What are you doing?  Stop  Stop  Stop  Oh, cool  This is good  Fucking rape  See?  She's struggling  And she's going to fall off that balcony  I hope  Oh  Hits him with the bomb  She goes  She is pushed over the railing  Uh-oh  Oh, hence  Hence why she's in the wheelchair  She's falling  She was crippled  Now she's falling  Falling  That's the spiral  It's like a  She's in high anxiety  The movie  Steve, I'm not going to get you on the phone 
[02:57:00]  It says Lady Gaga's in Playboy  Should be  She should be named  Lady Saggy Tits  Really?  She's got Rolling Stone  On the cover nude  But covered with bubbles  Bubbles  Lady Gaga  What a fucking idiot  Now the paparazzi are taking pictures of her  While she's laying  She's got the fucking newspapers showing up  And now the song starts  This is the song  Oh, now they're picking her up  And putting her in a wheelchair  Because she's paralyzed  How come she doesn't show her fucking face 
[02:57:30]  Ever  She's covering it up and doing distance shots  What's the art  She wears heavy makeup  I don't think this is art  I don't mind the heavy makeup  But now she's wearing sunglasses  It's part of the putting  Every half a second  She's probably cross-eyed  It's part of the performance  Maybe she's  Lady Google eyes  Because Anne's right 
[02:58:00]  She's never shown her eyes  No  Maybe she's in a glass eye  Like Sandy Duncan  Oh, hot  Now she's going to try to walk  With braces  That's hot  Now she's trying to walk  I love a girl in magic shoes  Who falls on the rug  And you just put your dick in her butt  She can't feel it  This sucks a dick  No, no, no  You're a gay man  You're not even listening to this song  You're not giving it a chance  What an outcube  You're being very judgmental  She's cute little underbite 
[02:58:30]  She's cute teeth  I can't figure it out  If she's cute or not  Yeah, she's a great dumper  She has a very sexual attitude  No, she doesn't  She does  That stinks  It's called the attitude  Yeah, exactly  Sexual attitude  She loves dick, though  Yes, she does  Does she love the dick?  Did you guys hear this?  I pulled it  Does she love the dick?  Well, you want to find out here?  Sure do  Lady Gaga talks about her love life  While Lady Gaga is as famous for her wardrobe  As she is for her music 
[02:59:00]  Bordrade  There's one accessory she's most certainly without  Cock  With no man in tow  And rumors of bisexuality  The famed performer is downright clear  On what she looks for in a partner  Big dick  And what else?  That's it  That's it  So does that mean that any guy out here  Who thinks, hey, I've got one of those  Has a chance?  Yep  So we're looking for a guy with large aspects?  Oh no, I'm not looking for anyone  Are you happy just on your own? 
[02:59:30]  Are you seeing anybody?  I'm very happy with my solitude  She likes big dick  I like that  I respect that  Yeah  Good girl  Yeah  She's just trying to be a little shock  It worked  I had a fucking drop leak out  Really, my dick just did like a little drool bubble  It was like this  Why aren't there any naked Lady Gaga pictures  From Playboy or something?  She's not  She wasn't in Playboy  That guy was completely wrong  Alright, well the guy was trying to help the show up  I don't know about Lady Gaga like you do, Sam 
[03:00:00]  She was semi-nude on the cover of Rolling Stone  But she was covered with bubbles  Is marriage something  I wish it was Michael Jackson's bubbles  And it was fucking ripping her tits off  And biting her face  Yeah, like that lady in Connecticut  She has no hands  She's lady  Yeah  Just hit her tongue  Is marriage something that is important to you?  No  My art is the only thing that's important to me  Do you want kids?  I think I would make quite a good mother, actually 
[03:00:30]  I'm a very good friend  But I'm not really excited to have kids or anything  I'm really enjoying traveling the world  And sleeping with really good-looking people  Where's she from there, Sam?  She's from here  I heard she's an NYU grad  Yeah, she graduated from NYU School of Music  She's from here  Oh yeah, so she knows how to play the whole game  Yeah  That's what she's doing  The Lady Gaga  I wouldn't mind giving her backside a little kiss  A little kissy 
[03:01:00]  Something about her  I'll give her that  Her fucking, everything below the neck  Yeah  Her face is okay, too  I mean, I'd give her a smooch-a-roo  She's average  She looks kind of like Courtney Love on the cover of Rolling Stone  Yeah, she does  Like a younger version of Courtney Love  Younger, yeah  You guys interested in listening to Spencer Pratt's rap song?  I actually would like to hear that  We have to stop, man  No, I agree with Sam  We really have to stop  Spencer Pratt's rap song is probably really good  The listeners have been saying it for 20 minutes  But I think they're right finally  Probably really good  It's time to sell them on Spencer Pratt  And this is the way we're going to do it today  I don't disagree 
[03:01:30]  Who has it?  Steve, Mr. Steve C  Yes  And what's the rap song?  Oh, hold on  It's called I'm a Celebrity  Yeah  Hope he talks about some of the harder parts  About being a celebrity, too  Yeah  I think that we don't get to see  Good so far  On air with Ryan Seacrest 
[03:02:00]  Baby, I get paid  I don't volunteer  I'm a Celebrity  Get me out of here  Get me out of here  Get me out of here  I'm a Celebrity  Get me out of here  Baby, I walk TV  And run the internet  And around the world  It's still, I'm not finished yet  I'm a Celebrity  Get me out of here  Get me out of here  Get me out of here 
[03:02:30]  First tweet of the day  I threw my swag on  Louis rag on  Car with the new tags on  You know I  Fucking die  What?  Why, he's good  I'm a superhero with  Stop the working  I'm a Blue Private in LA  I'm back home  Through the Palisades  Top down  Get my tan on  I'm not you  I don't need the tattoos  All my ink is on my checks  So Rolex  Look like some presents  I got a present at risk  Oh, the Rolex  I want to apologize 
[03:03:00]  To the black man  Oh  Yeah, yeah  That is a grave injustice  Second to slavery  What?  No, no, no  Second to slavery  Black man should apologize to us  For stealing all our fat lungs  Get me out of here  Get me out of here  I'm a Celebrity  You're not a Celebrity  Tee  He's a super celebrity  And Lady Gaga  Page 125  Of the June issue  Of Playboy  Whatever  Naked  Probably not 
[03:03:30]  I'm playing an article  America hates me  Because the media loves me  I'm so charged up  They can't even unplug me  That's stop  Oh, really?  I'm bad  Hey  There you go  You've been unplugged  Oops  You know how famous that guy is?  Oh, wow  Okay, hold on  Lady Gaga has a nice shitter  Let's zoom in on Lady Gaga's ass  She has a nice ass, huh?  She sure does  Little pale cheeks  Wearing fishnet stockings  Not bad  Alright 
[03:04:00]  She's the best  That ain't bad  That ain't bad, Sam  So pick up the CD, right?  No, no  I hate her music  Too bad her asshole can't sing  What?  But, uh  I hate her music  But I'm kinda  I still can't figure it out  Probably smells like a surfing turf  Oh  Fucking dirty crack  God  I feel sweaty from doing a stage show  Just dripping down there  From her fucking  Between her shoulder blades  All the way down to her knees  Got some lint from her costume in it  If you lick her ass  You'd have to go  Piece of fucking costume lint 
[03:04:30]  You guys wanna hear a little more  Of the celebrity song?  Oh, yeah  I'd rather hear the sound of a bullet  Hitting me in the chest  It gets really good right here  No way  No way  What is this garbage?  What is this garbage?  That wasn't the song  This is garbage  No way  Matt from Buffalo  Even auto-tuning can't help this rap 
[03:05:00]  You don't need to auto-tune that rap  What's up with the auto-tuning?  Jay-Z put out a new song last week  It's the death of auto-tune  It's over now  Really?  Yep  When Jay-Z says  Enough with the auto-tuning  That's it, right?  When the king says it  It's done  Was he the first to do the auto-tuning?  Nope  But now it's over  Auto-tuning makes everyone sound good  Jay-Z doesn't need auto-tuning  That's why Jamie Foxx  Has another hit on his hands  Because of the auto-tuning  How Jamie Foxx has hits at all  He played fucking Ray  And then everybody took him all seriously 
[03:05:30]  As a singer  We hate doing  Singer  We hate doing pop culture breaks, Sam  Why?  Look how angry the room is  You brought a lot of anger in here  People should be abreast of what's going on  Should they?  Yeah  Jay-Z said enough with the auto-tuning  It's his new single, Death of Auto-Tuning  It's the greatest  Why is it good?  Because he's the man  He's the god  I like the 99 Probs  That would be funny  Is that an old song now?  99 Probs is indeed an old song  How old is that song?  Because that one was good  It came out many years ago  I actually liked that one a lot 
[03:06:00]  Well, yeah  It was a good song  It's the only Jay-Z song I could name  Jamie, can you name a Jay-Z song?  He's as big as they come, my friend  Um...  Hover the God  Who?  Hover the God  No, I don't know that one  That's not a song  I'm saying that's who he is  Oh  And can you name a Jay-Z song?  Not one  Why are we playing a new one?  I don't know that one  Oh, Bonita Applebaum  That's one of the songs  It's an old rap 
[03:06:30]  Bonita Applebaum  So fucking enraging  Alright, listen  I think we annoyed  Everybody enough  Can I tell you  Whose fucking new stuff is really good?  Yeah  Eminem's  Oh yeah?  You like it?  He's the only  There's certain criticism  I'd have him  But  He's the only fucking rapper  That talks about being afraid  He's the only rapper  That talks about fucking  Being like in emotional pain  Like the rest of them  It's all about getting shot  Or having fucking possessions  But he talks about growing up  And  There's one song 
[03:07:00]  He talks about being fucking molested  Really?  Put on Insane  Do you have Insane?  And his raps are all real  They're great  He's not making up scenarios  He likes talking about his  Oh my god  Every day this is fun  Jesus Christ  You don't have Insane  Holy shit  Why?  It's a new album  How do we not have  The whole new album?  What are we a bunch of queers?  What do you have?  I think they just put the singles  In the system  For the audience  There's someone that walks around  The facility that just  Doesn't believe in bras  Yeah, yeah  These things just  She's gotta be like  Bruising herself or something 
[03:07:30]  You see those things bounce?  Is she a tennis player?  Maybe 20 years ago  He's got us  He's got us  My stepfather said  That I sucked in the bed  So one night he snuck in and said  We're going out back  I want my dick sucked in the shed  Can't we just play with  Teddy Ruxpin instead?  After I fuck you in the butt  Get some head  Bust a nut  Get some rest  The next day my mother said  I don't know what the fuck  Stop with this kid  The pastor won't even eat nothing  He's dead  He just hung himself  In the bedroom  He's dead  Debbie don't let that fucker 
[03:08:00]  Get too upset  Go in there  Stick a fucking cigarette  To his neck  I bet you he's faking it  I bet you  I bet he probably just wants to see  How upset you would get  I won't handle this of course  Unless you object  I'll go fuck his brains out  If any's left in his head  If you could count the skeletons  In my closet  Under my bed  And up under my faucet  Then you would know  I completely lost it  Is he nuts?  No, he's insane  If you could count the skeletons  In my closet  Under my bed  And up under my faucet  Then you would know  I completely lost it 
[03:08:30]  Is he nuts?  No, he's in your bed  Fuck, I tried to bite my face off  I just got fucking chased off  With a chainsaw  Then he took the chainsaw  Bit the fucking blades off  Ate the blades  Like a baseball  And a slingshot  Then he aimed at his own face  Let the thing pop  Took his eye out  I can't keep track what's happening  I would like this song  If it wasn't about molestation  Do you think it happened to him, Jimmy?  I like it because it is  Exactly  I don't know  I mean 
[03:09:00]  His mother's name was Debbie, right?  Mm-hmm  And that's what tells me  That it's real  Because the guy goes  Debbie, like  That's a real  Probably, I mean  He must have been  Quite the tussleable little kid  Oh, sure  He was handsome as an adult  He's all about exaggerated truth  Elements of it  Exaggerated  Well, that's exaggerated  Exaggerated  He's all about exaggerated truth  It probably  There probably are elements of truth  And the song before that  He's called My Mom  He's got a really cool show  About his mother  Being hooked on Valium  So I liked it  And there's a couple of songs  On here that are  Really fucking great 
[03:09:30]  He's a talented motherfucker  He's a brilliant dude  I think he went after Kim Kardashian  You know, that's kind of  That's my only criticism of him  Is he never goes after anybody  Like, you want to make fun of  Pop culture people, fine  But he never goes after anybody  Who's really  Go after the homies  Never, though  Yeah  Ooh  He knows they, you know  He owes them  Uh, Footer  Heard what we were saying  About somebody here at SiriusXM  Footer  Joe, what's up, boys?  Hey, um  It's a little distracting, but  I know you keep getting fucking  You know, you keep looking up 
[03:10:00]  And somebody's got to take care  Of those big tits flopping around  That G-Rock needs to put  A fucking bra on  Oh, no, see  Ha, ha  Hey, Jimmy, I'm going to come see you  Down at the Palm Beach gym, Rob, buddy  Nice  Oh, thank you  I'll be there the 19th and 20th  The 18th, I'll be in Fort Lauderdale  So come see the show twice  It just gets better  Footer rules  Look at us!  Breit parked!  Twice in one week!  Breit parked?  That's because we threatened  Open Anthony exclusive  Bret Michaels tour manager  Confirms singer's injuries 
[03:10:30]  Nice  You have to love Andrew Breitbart now  Yes  He's being very good to the show  Did we get a little front page action there, Steve?  I still can't spell his fucking name, though  I know, I don't know  I before E except after what?  There's an E and an I and a T and an A  And an R and a bunch of B's  B-R-E-R-T  B-A-R-T  Wow  Wow, front page for the boys today  Top thing on the front page?  Let me hear it  Click on that link  Let's listen to us  And how good we are  Watch it say Radio Hatch 
[03:11:00]  Radio Shitheads  Obi and Anthony  I hope I had something good to say  During the Bret Michaels thing  Yeah, you never know  And we're going to be on Breitbart, Jimmy  Let's see if you did better this time  Bret Michaels tour manager on the line  Pete  Hey Pete, what's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  Hey, don't forget  Guitar player as well  Guitar player and tour manager  Oh, fuck yeah  That's right  What's up, Pete?  How are you this wonderful morning?  Very good  We have to know  What happened to Bret  We saw the clip 
[03:11:30]  From the Tony Awards  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait  That's misrepresenting us  We did not watch the Tony Awards, okay?  I said we saw the clip  If we knew Bret was on it  Maybe we would have watched  The beginning of the Tonys  But yeah, we saw the clip this morning  We don't watch that stuff  You could have gotten away with it  In the first couple minutes  And still said you didn't watch the Tony Awards  Right  Alright, good  So now  What I saw was this  Let me know how accurate I was here  They're all playing 
[03:12:00]  Bret decides  He's going to get that last bit of  Hey from the crowd  And as he turns to walk back  Everyone else is already up on the riser  Kind of behind this  Big piece of set  That was coming down  And Bret  I think  From his cowboy hat  Didn't see  The big piece of equipment  And bam  Smacked right into it  With his head  And hit the ground  Tell me what happened  From watching it on YouTube 
[03:12:30]  And stuff  I imagine that's exactly  What it looks like  But you know  Let's be honest with you  The entire thing  Was timed to a T  It was rehearsed  And rehearsed again  And Bret's a pro  With all that stuff  And that drop  Was falling a little bit  Ahead of time  It was falling fast  And it should  And Bret had confidence  As many times  As they'd walk through it  That he'd be able to  Not get hit  Well how about he ducks  He tried ducking  When he realized 
[03:13:00]  Like oh  He went  Yeah yeah  He's first into that thing  I mean the cowboy hat  Definitely  Probably obstructed the view  A little bit  Yeah  Again they've done it  So many times  And it's gone off  Flawlessly during rehearsals  That he walked with confidence  Because the entire thing  Was timed to the music  Everything was timed perfectly  Yeah he did walk with confidence  Right into that thing  So  So the curtain dropped  The curtain key was dropping  Just a little earlier  Than it was supposed to  So how is he doing  Did he get any injuries  From that  Yeah man  Yeah 
[03:13:30]  His nose is broke  From what I understand  Holy shit  He's got some stitches  And stuff  It cut his lip up  And his nose pretty good  God damn  Yeah they cut right away  From when it happened  And they cut to some woman  Who was just kind of  Looking like  Now when you saw that  Did you howl with laughter  Like we did  I actually didn't see it  I was in the hotel  Across the street  Doing some business  And stuff  And I got the call  To come running over there  Oh okay  I probably saw it  The same time you did

[03:31:00]  Yes  Police were called  To the 38th street  In Washington station  Because of a man on board  Playing with feces  That's not a snap  Playing  See this is why  Is it playing when it's feces  See this is why  You gotta allow  You know  Violent video games  Or you're gonna have this  All over the place  People are gonna be so bored  Is it playing with feces though  Because like  It becomes a whole other thing  I think it's  Yeah  What do you think it is  I don't know 
[03:31:30]  Because you're not  Playing with it  Toying  Oh toying  Manhandling feces  Or handling  Yes  Handling feces  Fiddling about  Something  Yeah  Twiddling feces  I'm not playing with feces  Let me think  It depends on what he's doing  Because it's so sick  Wait  That the word playing  Doesn't even fit  Put a pile of feces  In front of you  An imaginary pile  And like  What is it  Like you're kinda  Now you can  Handle it  You're handling  You're kinda fooling around  With feces  I'll call it  You're jockeying  With feces 
[03:32:00]  Ah  Online feed is dead  Online feed is down  You're kidding  Alright  Alright  We gotta get the feces story  The girls pretty much  Summed it up  Police were told  The man who was  On board the train  Was flicking  Or smearing feces  Which she had with him  That's so nasty  It was 8 in the morning  The middle of rush hour  Passengers who did what they could  To get away  Were allowed to get off the train  At 38th street in Washington 
[03:32:30]  Other riders  Can't imagine  Being in that situation  I would move  And change  To another seat  Just run off the light rail  Really?  Wow  Really?  You would move your seat?  If someone was flicking shit at me  I think I'd move  Yeah  Wow  You're a crazy woman  Just run off the light rail  I don't even care if it was a movie  I would obviously move  From the area  Of the feces  Really?  And make sure  I tell the correct authorities  About the situation  The train operator  Was notified  And light rail  Quickly took the train  Out of service 
[03:33:00]  It's a biohazard  And we have protocols  For how we handle  Situations like this  Those protocols  Include disinfecting the train  Even though this is  Very bizarre  Light rail  Anticipates everything  The metro  Is a public space  What happens  Potentially in a park  Could also have the potential  To happen on board  The man who police say  Is homeless  Was questioned at the station  And eventually released  Why was he released  If he was throwing shit around  On a train?  They just don't hold anybody  For shit  Unless it's murder 
[03:33:30]  For shit  Literally  For rape  Yeah for shit  Like if you do a real crime  But they don't hold people  And then this guy  Will do something crazy  And then just chop someone up  And they'll be like  Well boy they had him  I don't understand why  This guy wasn't held longer  For something  There's no rooms  In the jails anymore  I guess  Oh I understand  That today is someone's birthday  Happy  Oh  Where is he?  Mars  Is it?  It's Mars' birthday?  Mars is his birthday  But he's gotta take care  Of the online feed  Cool

I just thought it was like  You know  Some knowledge  Yeah I hear Obama  Is gonna tax the wealthy  A little more  To get her health care through  Also for every person 
[03:35:00]  Schwarzenegger's talking  About a 15%  Flat tax  Flat tax  That's getting spoken about now  By people again  That'd be fantastic  But it ain't gonna happen  With a fucking  Piece of shit  Democrat  Congress  And everybody  It just won't happen  Cause you'd turn that 15  Into 17  Into 20  Into 22  And then everybody's  Pan through the nose  Oh my god  I just wanna get to the finish line  In one piece  Yeah right  Yep  When we
