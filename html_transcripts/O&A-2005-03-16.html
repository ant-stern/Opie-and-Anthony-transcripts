<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a raucous promotion of "Whip Him Out Wednesday" (WoW), a contest encouraging women to submit photos for prizes, including a MiFi device.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, detail their self-promotion strategy and hype their upcoming live broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe.  Numerous crude jokes and anecdotes follow, including a running gag about a caller's alleged bandana stunt and considerable ribbing of Eric, a staff member.  A recurring comedic element is a drunken-sounding audio clip of someone yelling "ONA Party Rock!", attributed to Master Poe, who denies intoxication.  The hosts then discuss a Metallica documentary, prompting a conversation about the challenges of aging bands and their creative processes.  A caller, Sally, shares that she has lived for three years without a dresser, storing clothes in piles on the floor, leading to uproarious disbelief and further vulgar humor from Opie and Anthony.

The show continues with Opie and Anthony comparing their vastly different lifestyles.  Opie recounts his nomadic past, having lived in over 20 places since age 18, contrasting sharply with Anthony's recent Long Island home purchase.  They reminisce about their cramped U-Haul move to Boston, where Opie discarded a VCR on the curb. They describe Anthony's sparsely furnished apartment, highlighting the infrequent nature of their visits to each other's homes, their last being after their firing from a previous radio job.  This leads to a discussion of their firing, the ensuing two-and-a-half-year hiatus, the loyalty of some sponsors like Joey from Paisano’s (who even pulled his ads in solidarity), and the disloyalty of others. Several audio clips are played: an ABC News report on their firing, a listener-submitted song, "Apple Trees," about a large penis, a poorly edited Paisano’s commercial, and listener-created jingles about Anthony, including one with the repeated phrase, "Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. Here comes Professor Anthony."  A lengthy discussion about a listener's ("Stalker Patty") physics experiment and the ensuing online debate about gravity and air resistance follows, concluding with more banter and a bizarre Babes Autoville advertisement.

The next segment delves into the Boston Big Dig, with callers and the hosts discussing cost overruns, leaks, and alleged worker drunkenness and corruption. A former Big Dig truck driver corroborates these claims.  Opie surprisingly defends the project, while Anthony criticizes it. The discussion extends to Mass Pike tolls and NYC commuter costs. The second half of this segment focuses on celebrity gossip, including Mario Vasquez's withdrawal from *American Idol*, Britney Spears's appearance and potential pregnancy, Demi Moore's rumored pregnancy, and the abandonment of small dogs after the trend fades. A phone call with a heavily intoxicated Jessica and Jim ensues, filled with explicit sexual content and bizarre tangents.  The conversation becomes chaotic and unintelligible before they abruptly hang up.  The hosts react and segue back to "Whip them out Wednesday."  A call with comedian Jay Moore concludes the segment.

Comedian Jay Moore calls in, discussing his recent divorce, a bizarre sexual encounter with an Argentinian woman, cancelled comedy dates, his attempts (or lack thereof) to appear on the show, relationships with other comedians, and opinions on Robin Williams and Howard Stern.  In-studio guests include Steve, Ben, and possibly others. Anthony graphically recounts a sexual encounter. The conversation includes discussions of Jay's failed gigs,  production issues, difficulty securing guests, voicemail system challenges, and a Howard Stern audio clip discussing Jay.  Impressions of Chris Penn and Harvey Keitel are performed.  The "Jackass" show and movie are also discussed. The upcoming Hard Rock Cafe broadcast is mentioned alongside jokes about the hosts and staff.  Racist and sexist remarks are made throughout this segment.

The final excerpt focuses on Opie and Anthony's move from XM's premium channel to its basic service.  They argue this is a strategic decision by XM to boost their listenership, contrasting it with the Playboy channel's poor performance.  Bruce Kelly, XM's VP and CFO, is a guest, defending the move and highlighting the Playboy channel's surprisingly loyal audience.  He explains the intention to expose Opie and Anthony to a wider XM listenership. Kelly also discusses a staff member, Jim, leaving for HBO.  ELO, another XM employee, is also in-studio, leading to jokes about his haircut and avoidance of the D.C. office. The conversation touches upon the frustrations of working in the D.C. office and ELO’s excitement about joining the Opie and Anthony show.  Self-deprecating humor, sarcastic comments about corporate decisions, and crude, sexually explicit jokes are prevalent throughout. The show concludes with confirmation of the next day's Hard Rock Cafe broadcast.

[00:00:00]  Ian Anthony, XM202 
[00:00:30]  XM202 
[00:01:00]  XM202 
[00:01:30]  XM202  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  ...unites to fight the forces of evil. 
[00:03:30]  The Obi and Anthony Show.  Oh, my sweet Jesus.  With Op Op.  I want to be known as Notorious.  No.  Attack.  Everyone is always in my way.  Oh, you really are deluded.  And B-Cup.  Kind of fat-breasted and awful.  And surrounded by dullards.  Ben looks like girly sliced milk.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Ever Steve yawns?  It looks like the back of the Batmobile in a Dexotic.  Pauketosis.  Eric, you're not going to cry.  Shut up. 
[00:04:00]  And armed with superhuman powers.  He holds his pants down and just starts leaking into someone's garbage can.  That's rule one.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  It's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens.  Average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talkers, Opie and Anthony.  We are just...  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do it!  No, I think we better watch one.  It's going to make me sick. 
[00:05:00]  You and Laura.  Hey, you guys.  No, I know!  You like movies about gladiators? 
[00:05:30]  You ever seen a grown man naked?  You know what they say.  See a broad to get that booty yak?  Lay her down and smack him yak.  Come on, got to be.  Have you ever been in a Turkish prison? 
[00:06:00]  We have clearance, Clarence.  Roger, Roger.  What's our vector, Victor?  ONA Party Rock!  ONA Party Rock!  ONA Party Rock!  What the hell is ONA Party Rock?  I don't know.  That was Poe drunk in the street during Mardi Gras or something like that?  Poe?  Yeah, that's Master Poe.  Wait, let's hear that again.  ONA Party Rock!  You just mind your P's and Q's, Buster, and remember who you're dealing with. 
[00:06:30]  That's right.  PJ, hi.  You're on the air.  Hi, Howard.  Hi.  Twelve hundred years of this misery.  I mean, I don't know what this guy wants from me.  I'm not even talking about saying that they really, like, actually rip you off.  How can I honestly say anybody rips me off?  I mean, when I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then... 
[00:07:00]  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the car.  Dude, get with it.  All right, well, I mean...  Give me an original idea.  Come on.  I know.  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all.  What's that going on?  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  Asshole!  Asshole!  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program. 
[00:07:30]  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Pardon?  You're my French, but you're an asshole!  We make it very simple.  You don't have to tie bandanas around...  Bandanas around your car.  Around your car or your antenna.  What?  Shut the fuck up, you asshole.  What?  How do you...  What?  That's fantastic.  Yeah, it's just like what we do.  Sure it is.  And there's no real proof that he ever did it.  And if he did do it, he might have done it for maybe one day.  In Washington. 
[00:08:00]  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him.  Yeah, it's WoW.  Yeah, boss.  Yeah, that's what you did, boss.  Yeah, boys.  Everyone just sits around and yeses him to death.  The yes man.  Yep.  And kisses his ass because they're scared to speak up.  Anyway, it is Whip Him Out Wednesday.  Yes, it is.  WoW season is slowly but surely approaching here on the East Coast.  Too slow.  I think April is going to be the official kickoff to WoW.  What we're going to do, we're going to invite ladies to come down here to get their WoW pictures taken. 
[00:08:30]  We really need your help, guys.  Live?  Yes.  It's time to market the hell out of this radio show.  We're going to do it ourselves, we've decided.  We had a long discussion about this last night, didn't we, Anthony?  Wink, wink.  Oh, we did?  Huh?  What?  I don't need to discuss this stuff with you.  I don't know.  We like, I don't know, we communicate telepathically at this point.  We have a telepathic communication.  We don't even need to discuss things anymore.  Yeah.  I just know what he's thinking, he knows what I'm thinking, so this sounds like a good idea, right? 
[00:09:00]  It certainly does.  We're going to market this show ourselves and we're going to start with the month of April is the official kickoff to WoW.  So the ladies are going to come down here, they're going to get their pictures taken.  And we want a lot of ladies to show up.  We'll be very nice, I swear to you.  Even if that means, you know, getting some duct tape and throwing it over my mouth, I swear I'll be really, really nice.  Because now we're desperate.  We need to get the marketing going here.  Yeah, that might keep chicks from coming in. 
[00:09:30]  A couple of girls have come in and you haven't been too nice to them.  Well, I understand that, Anthony.  I'm working on that every day.  Although I did go to the various websites and message boards and check out the people's response to the Polish girl that came in.  Yeah.  And it was a landslide victory for Opie on that one.  Thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  People were just saying, oh my God, what a pig.  Yes, Opie's right.  I couldn't believe the difference between, you know, the live shots that were taken of her and what was on that website, that modeling website. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  It was a very big difference.  So we're really looking for a lot of ladies to start showing up at the radio station.  Every morning, it's an open call.  You just come down, get your wow shots done.  I'm assuming you could even email them in as long as it's a wow sticker or something, right?  Yeah, you got to have a wow in front of you.  Got to have a wow and Opie and Anthony in front of you.  And then by the end of the month, we're going to pick the best wow, and that person's going to win a MiFi, I think.  Ooh.  And maybe even more stuff.  More stuff, because I think we've got sponsors coming onto the program, and maybe even Washington will wake up and realize, first of all, we're doing this. 
[00:10:30]  That's the first step.  The first step is them actually knowing what we're doing on the show.  Yeah, the first step for the marketing department in Washington is to be in touch with the show, maybe listen every day, and pick up on what we're doing.  And then you guys could enhance what we're doing by going, hey, this would be a perfect opportunity to give them this to give away.  Right.  That's all we're looking for.  That's it. 
[00:11:00]  So it's a little advice to the marketing department.  You might want to start listening to the Opie and Anthony program.  And then maybe you could help and participate as we go along here.  Well, they must have been psyched that you're doing the Hard Rock tomorrow.  I think they just found out about that.  Yeah, I'm hearing rumors that the marketing department just found out about us doing a live broadcast tomorrow at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Ben was all laughing, and he comes in, don't, don't, they didn't even know.  They didn't even know, dude.  But that's Ben.  You don't know what to believe. 
[00:11:30]  What do you mean?  You say Ben's a liar?  It's not that he's a liar.  He exaggerates a little bit.  So I think, I think Ben is correct 70% of the time, which is a good average, but Jesus, what a bash.  What?  He'll admit it, that he exaggerates a little bit.  Wait, what is Ben exaggerated about?  Jim's whole impression is based on the fact that Ben exaggerates.  The whole doing coke with Tom Brady and, you know.  I think Ben is a man about town and actually is in these situations. 
[00:12:00]  He is.  I think he has sat with Bono and did coke with Tom Brady?  Shared a Guinness.  I don't think, to tell you the truth, I don't think Ben ever said he did coke with Tom Brady.  Oh, that was just Jim's impression?  It's such a great impression.  Sometimes I get confused that I'm actually, you know, listening to Ben.  I know.  I'd rather, believe me, I'd rather have the Jim impression than the real Ben.  The Jim impression is a lot more fun.  It's a lot funnier. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  So all the details for the wow thing, I guess, will be up on OpenAnthony.com and FoundryMusic.com.  But basically, open call.  You just come down to the station.  You get your shots taken.  It will be very nice.  We'll have little things to give you as you come down to the station.  We'll throw you on the air.  And then, you know, some of the best wows of the month.  We'll get some fine prizes.  There you go.  And also, don't forget about RateMyWow.com, a branded website by Steve.  Doesn't that sound like Rape My Wow?  Rape.  Every time someone says it, I'm like, yeah, Rape that wow.  Rape.  And then I realize it's Rape. 
[00:13:00]  RateMyWow.com.  Get all disappointed.  Yeah.  And there's new pictures going up on that site every day.  So, nice.  And if you want to participate in a wow, you just send a self-addressed stamped envelope.  It's us here in New York City.  And we'll send off the official wow bumper sticker.  Not a bandana.  Oh, no.  A wow bumper sticker.  Not a bandana.  He's absolutely delusional.  I love it.  He's delusional.  Okay.  And then if you have the wow in the car and the girls see that, they might just flash you on the highway. 
[00:13:30]  It happens.  I mean, it just happens.  Yeah.  And we don't have to spend a lot of time on it.  You know, as long as you get the wow in your car.  Yeah, that's it.  Or make a homemade wow or write it in the back of, you know, the dirt that collects on the back of the trucks.  You'll be set and ready to go.  Sure.  What's going on, guys, man?  What's up?  Ah, please.  Yesterday, get out of here.  A little late.  A little later than usual.  Had to sit down and finish conversations with Voss.  You know, because there was subject matter that we didn't cover on the show that I felt I wanted to continue with Voss. 
[00:14:00]  Did anyone talk to Voss after the show was over?  No, just like we said.  Of course not.  Just like we said.  Just like we said would happen.  These mics go off and we all go our own ways.  Go our own ways.  Like, I need to keep talking to Anthony when the show's over?  Nothing against Anthony, but we said it all on the show.  It's more or less, take care.  We do the awkward walk up the street together.  We're not saying much of anything.  Take it easy, man.  What are you doing? 
[00:14:30]  Take it easy.  It's all awkward.  It's like, ah, that was a good show today, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, the lights change and I got across.  All right, well, maybe I'll call you later.  What?  What?  And Voss?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing goes on after the show with us and Rich Voss?  Although we did have to record some stuff yesterday, so I didn't get out of here until late.  Yeah.  And, you know, the 7 to 11 thing, great.  But I got to get out of here before noon on any given day. 
[00:15:00]  Manhattan around lunchtime.  Once again, I'm just sitting in traffic.  Oh, what's up, Po?  Hey, guys, I don't mean to interrupt you.  I wasn't drunk.  You can't get drunk over coffee, orange juice, eggs, bacon.  I didn't say you were drunk.  Who said drunk?  Eric said you were drunk.  Eric.  I would never accuse Master Poe of being drunk when he was in the street.  It sounded like a complete asshole.  O&A Party Rock!  O&A Party Rock! 
[00:15:30]  That is a great clip.  O&A Party Rock!  Yeah, okay.  What the hell is O&A Party Rock?  All right, well, fine.  I was enjoying myself.  I was told to go down and hand out stickers and have a good time.  He's high on light, not alcohol.  He didn't hear the clip because he's going to have a cell phone.  O&A Party Rock!  Yeah, that's a good one.  Well, you know what I noticed?  You've got to admit, it sounds a little, you know.  Four days.  O&A Party Rock!  Four days.  I lost my voice and I couldn't really talk. 
[00:16:00]  And I was told to go down and hand out stickers.  Club Soda Kenny told me to go down and hand out stickers and have a good time.  And that's exactly what I did.  O&A Party Rock!  Yeah, I know.  I don't know what O&A Party Rock means.  All right, well, whatever.  I do notice that...  We did all acknowledge how you did a great job down there, though.  Thank you.  You handed out thousands and thousands of wow stickers for us.  Thank you.  And cups and all.  But he was getting on this microphone that another club had in the middle of thousands 
[00:16:30]  of the people on the street and this is what he was coming up with.  O&A Party Rock!  No, no.  Come on.  That's an attention getter.  That's the only thing...  That's not the only thing I said.  Well, we can talk about how you started a line dance thing.  Well, yes.  He got some girls to start dancing right there in the street.  Yeah.  In front of our balcony.  Yes.  Pretty...  You know, the guy motivates people, obviously.  Yeah.  He's able to get some of these chicks, these drunken chicks.  Now, the chicks were drunk.  No, they worked there.  Really? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, they were the ladies working in the club.  Across the street from where we were broadcasting.  All right, so you want to go on record and say that when you did this...  O&A Party Rock!  You weren't drunk.  No, I wasn't drunk.  But once again, I know that comedians, sometimes they make mistakes.  Well, I'm not a comedian.  I was just there to make sure that you guys were safe.  I think you need to teach Eric a lesson for assuming that you were drunk.  That is a great clip.  O&A Party Rock!  That clip gets funnier and funnier, man. 
[00:17:30]  That's fine.  I have no problem.  Put him in a sleeper hold or something.  Oh, uh-oh.  Teach him a lesson.  You want me to do that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no.  No, I don't.  It goes, all right, whatever you guys want me to do.  And I just want you to know, also, Channel 4 videotaped that whole clip.  O&A Party Rock!  With the O&A shirt.  No, no, no, not that.  Oh, not that.  The one where I had my O&A shirt on and I was with the ladies dancing.  All right, very good.  Thank you, Master Paul.  We don't want to do anything to Eric?  No.  No.  Nah. 
[00:18:00]  Thank you, Eric.  All right.  You'll hurt him.  So you left here yesterday and what happened?  Traffic.  Were you doing heroin with Master Paul?  No, I...  Oh, my God.  Guys, what are you doing to me?  I don't take drugs.  I don't do any of that stuff.  That's a little play on the last joke.  Yeah, no, I understand.  It was kind of a sarcastic statement about Eric's exaggeration.  There was a lot of sarcasm in that statement.  It's okay.  About Eric's...  You know, you point to Eric, Jimmy.  You try to pawn it off on Eric. 
[00:18:30]  There was a little play on what Eric said.  Remember when he called you drunk?  I know, Paul was the only kid.  He just does so much coke in the morning.  And he comes in and he goes, all right.  Well, according to Eric.  According to Eric.  Oh, my God.  You are dead.  You're a dead man.  Eric, tell everyone what you were telling us in the office.  Yeah, we thought about it.  Where you saw him in the stall.  Doing what?  Uh-oh.  Bent over the stall.  Doing something.  No?  Oh, boy.  He doesn't want to share on the air.  You're asking for it.  He's scared for his life.  I don't blame him, you know.  Neither do I. 
[00:19:00]  Paul will kill you with a punji stick.  Beat me to death in my own hands.  Certainly will.  Yeah, no, nothing spectacular.  I'm just saying I've got to get out of here before noon.  I all of a sudden had those homicidal road rage feelings that I hadn't had in so long  because when I drive in, there's usually no one on the road.  I stay here until noon.  Pedestrians are out.  And it's only going to get worse once the weather gets nicer and more people want to walk the streets. 
[00:19:30]  God forbid they walk the streets of Manhattan, Anthony.  You know something?  They're in my way.  Get out of my way.  I hate pedestrians.  They've got to figure something out.  Bridges or tunnels underneath each street.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Another place for a rape to happen.  But, yeah, I just get in my way and then you get gridlock again.  You know, you don't get gridlock at 1030 in the morning when you're driving home.  But at noon, people decide they're just going to, even though the light is green, but there's nowhere for them to go. 
[00:20:00]  So they'll just end up in the middle of the intersection and the light turns red for them.  It's green for me.  And what am I staring at?  The passenger window of a cab or something that I just, I swear I want to hit the gas and just look at the passenger's little terrified face in the window as it just hits my grill.  I get that angry.  And then I got a hold of myself and went, hey, hey, easy, forget it. 
[00:20:30]  Kamo.  Kamo.  Kamo.  I put a glass dildo in my ass, rubbed my stomach, and said, Kamo.  Kamo.  Kamo, and everything was okay.  Got to the Queensborough Bridge.  I was fine.  Pulled the dildo out of my ass.  All was dandy.  All was great with the world.  Are you trying to make people feel sorry for you again today, Anthony?  No, no, no.  That was yesterday when I was talking about how I only have a day to pack for my 10-day Caribbean cruise. 
[00:21:00]  You're luxurious.  Luxurious.  Caribbean cruise.  Yes.  On Royal Caribbean.  They're a very good cruise line, by the way, if anyone wants to come.  Are they the best ones?  Cruise.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, someone out there that's a travel agent, just email me, man.  Find me somewhere I could go away by myself and have a great time just mellowing out.  Go visit Bob in California.  No, I don't want to.  I don't want to.  Spend your vacation with Bob.  I don't want a vacation where I have to run around and do a lot of stuff. 
[00:21:30]  I want to lay on a beach, read some books, do maybe some scuba diving, maybe a little snorkeling action.  You know what you should do?  By yourself?  Go to Turks again.  I did the Turks and Caicos three times.  Oh, that's right.  You've been there after we were there.  It's a lot of fun.  I'm looking for something different.  I was thinking maybe the, I don't know, Atlantis down there in the Bahamas.  You've got a long time.  What about Hawaii?  Yeah, that's what Bob says.  Come out and see me.  Bob, our super agent.  Come out and see me and then go to Hawaii.  Think how exciting Hawaii will seem after a visit with Bob. 
[00:22:00]  Sure.  You could go anywhere.  You could go to see Bob and go to Trenton.  I was going to say, it'll seem like Hawaii.  You beat me by a second.  I was going to say, yeah, go see Bob and then go to Iowa.  Well, Trenton makes, the world takes.  Oh, that's true.  A little motto.  Anthony, I finally saw some kind of monster last night.  The Metallica movie.  Ah.  Oh, my God.  What a great movie.  I haven't seen that one yet.  Documentary.  They, you know, their cameras follow them around as they try to, you know, record their 
[00:22:30]  latest album.  Yeah.  And St. Agnes or whatever.  And pretty interesting.  I didn't see that one yet.  Pretty interesting considering, you know, knowing where Metallica came from.  This band was from, what, San Francisco in the early 80s, making no money, all living  together, you know, getting their cassettes out.  And, you know, they had just an amazing underground following because radio wasn't going to play  their stuff.  Radio started playing Metallica. 
[00:23:00]  I remember I was working in Buffalo.  They only started playing Metallica, really?  And only a couple stations here and there?  In, like, 1990, 91.  Metallica was too hardcore.  Too hardcore.  And then they blasted onto the scene.  And, you know, you know the story of Metallica, obviously.  But it was kind of sad, this documentary, to see where the band has gone.  I don't know.  What was sad about it?  Well, they obviously all live, you know, separate lives now.  You know, like all these big bands that just continue onward, you know? 
[00:23:30]  Mm-hmm.  Kirk has this massive ranch in Northern California that he has to escape to.  And then you've got Lars, who collects, like, million-dollar paintings.  He does?  And then you've got James Hetfield, you know, who's got a family and decided in the middle  of recording the latest CD, not even in the middle, in the beginning, that he couldn't  take it anymore and he had to go into rehab.  And then he doesn't even talk to the band for, like, nine, ten months at all.  Rehab for what? 
[00:24:00]  They said alcohol and other things.  Yeah.  And how he was talking in the movie, it sounds like there might have been a sex addiction  thing happening.  Because he talks about how it started getting old to wake up in hotel rooms with someone next  to him, you know, really hungover, knowing he has to do a show, and it was meaningless.  And, you know, he wanted to find himself.  The movie's really, really good.  Find himself.  But it was just the stupid little things that made me think, oh, man, maybe they should just  pack it in.  And, you know, they actually hired a relationship therapist. 
[00:24:30]  They were paying $40,000 a month to try to keep the band together and try to get the band  to communicate with each other and open up.  And, Lars, why don't you tell James how you're feeling about that?  How much did it cost?  $40,000 a month.  And they had the guy up.  Did she also book guests for the band?  She was a guy.  Oh.  Sorry, it was my joke.  Yeah.  See, the booker.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I wasn't thinking.  But then I guess the sex of the person was very important.  Yeah.  I'm sorry. 
[00:25:00]  Well, yeah, you're right.  I feel...  What happened, guys?  Okay, it wasn't that good.  It was a really good opportunity, and I blew it.  I'm really sorry.  It wasn't that good joke, anyway.  You want to back up?  Nah.  No?  All right.  It's the moment to...  Ooh, where is it?  It's gone.  Maybe you and I need a relationship therapist.  You bring one in here, please.  Maybe, you know, I need to, like, you know, see the signs.  And I had a joke, and Opie thought it was important enough to say what the sex of the therapist was.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe I need to listen better. 
[00:25:30]  You need to listen.  And a relationship therapist would help us with that.  It was disgusting.  The guy's sitting around as they're recording the album on the couch, and...  How could you record an album when there's a relationship expert sitting there?  And then they're, like, having these, like, sit-down therapy sessions, I guess, at the Ritz-Carlton.  The Ritz-Carlton, you know?  They're renting suites so they could all get their feelings out.  And what was their problem with each other?  Did that come out?  Did they show that in the film?  Like, what, actually...  Yeah, kind of a...  Did they resolve it through this therapist? 
[00:26:00]  Well, James Hetfield started realizing that filming was kind of important in his life.  He also realized that the alcohol was getting out of control.  Also kind of wanted, you know, a little more of the power.  He felt like he was losing a lot of the power to Lars.  And I always thought Lars, over the years, was a dick.  Yeah.  Just in the interviews and the whole Napster thing and stuff.  He comes across like an ass.  But he doesn't come across like an ass in this movie at all.  He comes across as a guy that's very, very passionate about the band still,  and that James Hetfield, you know, was pretty much losing interest. 
[00:26:30]  Really?  And then they had a blowout, and they showed James Hetfield just slamming the door of the recording studio really, really hard.  And then he just disappears for almost a year.  Really?  That long?  And then they're still going through therapy with the relationship therapist at the Ritz-Carlton,  and then all of a sudden Kirk's like, yeah, I heard from James.  And everyone, you know, their eyes get wide, like, really?  What did he say?  What did he say?  And to me it was just so weird because these guys have been together for close to 25 years now.  He just took off.  Just took off.  Went into rehab and then decided the time wasn't right yet to get, you know, to talk to the guys. 
[00:27:00]  He had to deal with, you know, his personal crap first.  Wow.  You just want to wrap these people in the head when they're like that?  I was just really, really into the movie because you think about the creative process, you know,  and you think of guys like Metallica and other bands and even, you know, Stupid Howard.  All of a sudden you become something that you just weren't.  Yeah.  And then how do you continue being, you know, creative, you know?  Because it was all about these guys getting together in one room, hanging out, banging out these albums. 
[00:27:30]  It didn't matter if it took, you know, them staying up for three or four days,  doing whatever it took to stay up for three or four days at a time, you know?  And then so James Hetfield comes back into the band and then decides that he only wants to work four hours a day  because family's important.  Four hours a day.  And I'm thinking this is Metallica.  And the guy's like, I'll work from noon to four on the new album.  And that's it.  And one day they wanted to work a little later.  And James is like, nope, sorry, four o'clock.  I told you guys. 
[00:28:00]  Like he wouldn't, like, he wouldn't break that rule at all.  And then the next thing you know they show him leaving the studio instead of, you know,  continuing with the process, going to see his little girl, you know, at ballet class.  It was the weirdest fucking movie.  They're family guys.  No, I understand that to a point.  But you've got to think, you know, the creative process and their music, you know, has to suffer.  Right.  And I bought every Metallica album.  I didn't buy the latest album.  I might now that I've seen this movie because, you know, it's pretty interesting. 
[00:28:30]  But, you know, then they show Lars in his just ridiculous mansion.  And he's got all these paintings on the wall.  Yeah.  Dude, paintings that are easily 20 feet by 10 feet.  I mean, just massive, massive pieces of work, art, paintings, whatever.  And I'm thinking, ah, the guy collected a few paintings from some obscure artist.  That's kind of cute, you know.  Yeah.  But then he decides in the movie that he has to move on with that stage of his life.  And he has to get ready for the next 10 years of his life.  Why did he decide he had to get rid of, like, these guys are nuts. 
[00:29:00]  Is that it?  They're just crazy.  Something would, I don't know what happens to you when you get that famous and you get that much money.  Yeah, I think you just start losing touch with reality.  He sold one for $5 million.  That's where I was getting to.  So, yeah, he has, you know, his kid, or I don't even know how many kids, but, you know,  you hear the son in the other room screaming, daddy, daddy.  And he's like, yeah, I've got to get rid of all this stuff and move on with my life.  And so I'm thinking, oh, he's just going to sell a few paintings, get a few extra bucks,  no big deal.  Yeah, like Jimmy said, it's Christie's auction house. 
[00:29:30]  He's there.  First of all, they have a showroom in New York City for his work so people could check it  out for whatever, a week or two.  There was a show.  There was a show, all the artwork that he had in his mansion.  And then they show Mike Christie's getting completely hammered because he can't take the fact that  he's getting rid of all this stuff, even though he knows he has to, because they're kind of  like his children, his babies, he was saying, right?  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, you know, Jimmy kind of, thanks, Jimmy.  You blew my punchline. 
[00:30:00]  Jesus Christ.  I didn't know.  I thought you were moving along.  Get that relationship expert immediately.  I didn't know.  That was the whole thing.  That was the part where everyone in their cars go, oh, my God, what?  What?  It was worth listening to this babble for 10 minutes.  I disagree.  Because the punchline was perfect.  I think your whole story's been interesting, and that was just one point.  And I don't think that any point is more interesting than the next, the way you're telling this  excellent story.  So all of a sudden, you've got the auctioneer, and the price is going up and up and up.  Like one painting, $650,000.  Sold.  That was one out of whatever.  It looked like at least a dozen paintings. 
[00:30:30]  And then the grand finale, yeah, he sold one for $5 million.  Five mil.  Five mil.  He had a $5 million painting just hanging up in his place.  Then he decided he had to sell.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  I just think when you have to get into relationship therapists and all that, psychologists, band  psychology and all that, it's not worth it.  Oh, the other thing.  So James, he wanted to stick to the new to four work ethic thing so he could enjoy his 
[00:31:00]  family and stuff.  So, Mom, Lars is like, all right, well, you know, when you leave at four, you know, the  rest of us are just going to kind of listen to some of the, kind of listen to what we did  and, you know, maybe work a little bit.  And he got so pissed.  He's like, no, because then you guys are going to make decisions.  And when I come back tomorrow.  Well, if you want to be in on the decisions.  Right.  Stick around.  And when I get back tomorrow, it's going to be an uphill battle with you guys, because  you guys are already going to decide that this is good, bad, or indifferent.  He goes, no, I don't want anyone listening to the tapes while I'm not here. 
[00:31:30]  And Lars is like, you've got to be fucking kidding me, because that guy just lives and  breathes Metallica.  Well, you've got to give it to them that they've been together that long.  Probably these problems have been there for years, and they've stuck it together and pumped  out some serious cash.  Yeah.  They could afford $5 million on a painting.  And a $40,000 a month therapist.  That's just one bill that the band's paying from their corporation or whatever.  I'm going to wreck the movie.  Cliff Burton's been dead the whole movie.  Right?  See, I just wrecked it for everybody. 
[00:32:00]  The best part of the movie was Lars sat down when James Hetfield was gone, and they didn't  even know if the band was going to get back together.  He sat down with Dave Mustaine.  Really?  Who was their original...  Guitarist.  Which one, though?  The bassist?  No.  Guitarist.  Oh, another guitarist.  Right.  Yeah, before I had it.  Okay, and Mustaine's like, you know, I feel like a loser.  You know how bad it sucks to go down the street and people go, oh, there's the dude that used  to be in Metallica.  The Pete Best. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, but, well, he did well on his own with the whole Megadeth thing.  15 million albums.  15 million albums, according to the movie.  Yeah, and he's like, but, you know, you think I like being, you know, second and this.  It was a pretty intense exchange between the two.  It was really cool.  I was hoping that there was more of that in the movie.  Yeah.  I guarantee there's some great footage that these guys just said, you know what, we can't show  that, we can't show that, you know?  What'd you see it on?  What do you mean?  How did you watch it?  DVD?  Yeah, it's out on DVD.  Oh, it's out?  Oh, I thought maybe they'd be...  Now I gotta go with the bonus footage. 
[00:33:00]  I'm thinking the bonus footage might be...  Bonus footage might have some crap in there, yeah.  Yeah, because the movie is almost three hours long, I think.  It was long.  Wow.  So I'm gonna watch the second disc today.  You gotta give it to them guys, though.  They rock, man.  When you go see them live, holy Jesus.  I watched that on the plane to L.A., actually.  Oh, you saw the movie?  I saw most of it, but my battery on my laptop right now, because it is long, and I saw most  of it because I'm sitting in coach, my goddamn monitor was bent towards me, so it was kind  of hard to really enjoy it, but it was great what I saw. 
[00:33:30]  You gotta sit in first class, Jimmy.  Well, normally I'm a first class gentleman, but I mean, this time again, I felt like...  You've given it to Steve?  Yeah, I just wanted to sit with the common people.  I wrote some material about them.  Oh, nice.  You have to sit with the common people and write some material about them.  Let's go to Johnny on Long Island.  Johnny?  Hey, how's it going?  Good morning, boys.  Morning, Johnny.  Hello.  Hey, Binky Face.  Hi, Johnny.  Thanks for calling the program this morning.  Oh, thank you.  Listen, the most important thing you guys just forgot to let you...  I hope you didn't include yet is how they treated Jason Neustadt. 
[00:34:00]  They totally screwed him over.  Yeah, Jason, it's pretty interesting.  I think a lot of the guys even admitted this, so it wasn't just Jason's angle.  He just wanted more creativity.  And James Hetfield was like, hey, man, he was paranoid that I was going to take away from the band and stuff.  He's like, well, go off and do your thing then, you know?  And then they just trash him the rest of the movie.  I mean, they're not kind to him at all.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  And that echo brain that Jason ended up doing, we had Jason in.  We had him in when he started this new band, Echo Brain. 
[00:34:30]  We were, you know, it was a rare occasion where Anthony and I, we interviewed him and we were very polite.  We played one of the songs on our old show.  It was awful.  Yeah.  Absolutely awful.  Pretty bad.  And it turned out that, you know, he knew the project was doomed and then he ended up becoming the guitarist for Ozzy.  Basis for Ozzy and then Metallica picked up Robert Trujillo, who was Ozzy.  They just kind of traded bases.  Dude, that was pretty cool in the movie, too, when, you know, they're trying out all these guys, you know, for Jason's, for the bass player.  And they tried out some pretty impressive guys and they gave it to him. 
[00:35:00]  And then they gave him a million dollars up front for joining the band.  Wow.  Just so he could start living, you know, the Metallica lifestyle.  The Metallica lifestyle.  That's basically what they said.  I didn't see that part.  I missed that part.  They gave him a million dollars up front.  That was just up front, not counting everything else he had, whatever the percentage was in the band and the record sales and all that.  I think the idea that somebody walks into a successful franchise and is handed a million dollars up front, for Pete's sakes, I think that's a fantastic idea. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Fill out an expense report and send it to XM.  I'm sure you'll get it.  Do the math, bro.  The percentage is better for you.  So, we're not making Metallica money and you're, you did just fine.  I'm very happy.  Just fine.  Oh, and a party rock.  Oh, and a party rock.  Oh, I don't have enough.  I love these guys like that guy, Ron from the Bronx.  Metallica sucks since 91.  Like, you'll always get these guys, dude, they sold out.  So, dude, you just like the Metallica from, like, the 80s, the hard rock and, like, thrash metal almost Metallica? 
[00:36:00]  Ron.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ron.  Thank you.  We're having a conversation.  I'm sorry to hear you.  I can't hear you.  No, no, no.  Metallica hasn't made a good album since 91.  They went into a hard rock sound and then MTV found it more marketable and they played more of it.  That's it.  So, you'd be happy if Metallica just still sounded like they did in the 80s?  No, you have to transform your sound, but there's so many more metal bands like Unearthed and Lamb of God that are so much more talented with a better sound right now. 
[00:36:30]  I can play some stuff from the 80s, from Metallica, that just sounds so outdated.  It's very funny.  You didn't like, dude, you didn't like The Memory Remains or Fuel.  There's some great stuff they've done.  I mean, I love Metallica.  There's just the album with, like, you know, Unforgiven and, you know, Ed The Sandman on it, too.  I really have no problem with what Ron is saying.  I mean, because, like, for me, you know.  To say they suck since 91 is ridiculous.  But that's his opinion.  He's not empowered, but it's not like Master of Puppets and Battery. 
[00:37:00]  Everyone loves the songs.  It's great.  It's hard to follow those songs.  Everyone loses interest in a band at some point, okay?  Like, for me, and, you know, I love the Black Album.  It's one of my favorite albums of all time, by the way.  And I love all the stuff.  I like a lot of the stuff they did before the Black Album.  But after the Black Album, my interest slowly but surely started waning.  Yeah, of course.  And I didn't buy the latest album.  You know, I might now, like I said, because I saw the movie and I have a new interest.  But, you know, I bought Load and Reload. 
[00:37:30]  But I wasn't listening to those as much.  It could just be time, too.  How many other bands are there with the same situation?  You just kind of move on.  So that's why I don't have a problem with what, you know, Ron says.  But a band catches you.  Like, after Metallica, all of a sudden, Disturb comes along.  And you're like, holy shit.  Then you jump on with those guys for a while.  It's kind of hard to have that punch-me-in-the-face effect with a band for 20 years.  Right.  You know what I mean?  I mean, of course, Ozzy does that.  But, I mean, very few of them will have that effect on you.  I don't know. 
[00:38:00]  But you get so many people that are like, dude, they suck.  After, you know, after 91, they sucked.  Suck?  Maybe you don't like them as much.  Maybe they did kind of get a little more commercial than they were.  But these guys that just say they sucked.  I can't get enough of Sad But True, Wherever I May Roam, Classics.  And, you know, those two songs just, oh, my God.  But Classics, yes.  And do they get commercial, or are they so good that what is considered commercial changes? 
[00:38:30]  Like, Metallica, I mean, maybe they've changed a little bit.  But they're still a very heavy band.  Yeah.  But because they're so successful, all of a sudden, that becomes more acceptable to mainstream marketing ideas.  And, oh, Metallica sold out.  No, they didn't.  Just the rest of the fucking country changed their opinion and moved towards them.  Give them a few more years, and then you'll see.  Like, when hard-rocking bands get really old, and they start going to those little venues and playing at a reasonable volume.  Yeah, no, Metallica will just blow up sooner than later, by the way.  Yeah.  And one last thing in the movie that I found really interesting. 
[00:39:00]  I mean, you know, when you find a favorite band, you know, whether it's going back to Zeppelin or U2 or Metallica,  it's kind of scary when you start thinking about how these songs come about.  But they show them just sitting around in a studio.  They all have pads and paper, and they're just trying to rhyme words.  Like, someone throws a word out there.  I forgot the one they were trying.  Whatever.  Like, rain.  Well, rain in the back of his mane.  Oh, no, no. 
[00:39:30]  And they're just going around the room.  And it's like, that's how the song's coming together?  You think it's this real profound process of feelings and emotions, and meanwhile, it's like, hey, what rhymes with this?  And that's why I think, you know, a band like Metallica's in trouble, because, you know, now there's all sorts of restrictions on what they're doing.  Like, you know, James Hetfield only working four hours a day and all that.  You know, back in the day, you've got to think when, you know, Doors got together or Zeppelin, it was ready to go for the most part.  I wrote this poem, and let's go. 
[00:40:00]  Let's just figure out how it's going to sound musically, you know?  Not to be actually recording the album.  I mean, it's not like they came with a whole bunch of ideas, and now they pick through it.  No, they're trying to, like, develop and create songs on the spot.  And that was amazing to me.  Yeah, that's a little rough.  First time they tried that, though.  Remember, James always wrote the lyrics, and this was like a compilation, like, let's all chip in.  Yeah.  And they would try.  That's why they were doing that, because it was like a weird thing.  Like, let's just see if we can all chip in lyrically, and Hetfield, I think, was the guy who always did the lyrics. 
[00:40:30]  What always amazed me, because, I mean, I've been into music my whole life.  When I read about these bands that, okay, they record an album, and then they go on tour,  and then while they're on tour, they don't even attempt to write anything,  and then they finally get off tour, they go on vacation, whatever, you know,  they go away for three or four months, and then they decide, okay, we've got to start writing the new album.  To me, as a creative person, I'm like, wouldn't you be writing your whole life?  Like, wouldn't something, you know, pop in your head while you're on a bus in the middle of America or something? 
[00:41:00]  You know what I mean?  It probably did at the beginning, but you just reach that point where it's like, eh.  Where you just turn your brain off when you're touring, and you're not, you know, continuing to live and getting creative ideas?  When you have $4 million paintings hanging on your wall, you really don't have to write.  Four girls blowing at a time.  It's kind of hard to rhyme words.  Yeah.  What rhymes with fantastic?  Well, that's what I was thinking.  I mean, I was getting, I was really getting into this movie, and I was thinking, well, you know, what happens creatively that all of a sudden, yeah, you do, you shut off your brain. 
[00:41:30]  You know, like you said, you're in this really nice mansion looking at four or five million dollar paintings.  Yeah.  You know, and then all of a sudden, because you're living this new life, your creativity starts to go away, I guess.  That's true.  It happens.  We've got to watch out for that, Opie.  You know, I was kind of thinking about us watching this movie.  Got to watch out for that.  A little bit.  Let's go to Sally in Minnesota.  You get those perks in your apartment like a chair.  Hold on a second. 
[00:42:00]  Hold on.  You know, you'll start going, hey, here we go.  Now I'm living the life.  You don't have to worry about me, but I did order a dresser.  Thank you.  You did.  Thank you.  Yes.  Breaking news on the Opium Anthony program.  A dresser.  Where have you kept your clothes up until now?  On the floor.  Are you kidding me?  No, man.  Stop it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  I can't even believe that.  Hold on, Sally.  Okay.  Your clothes are piled on the floor of your room.  Anthony, I... 
[00:42:30]  How long have you been there?  Three years.  Three years you haven't had a dresser?  No.  What is wrong with you?  I just, like, I live differently.  I can't, I don't know what it is.  Differently?  That's differently than anybody in this country.  I like being kind of, uh, I like having the feeling that I'm like a free spirit.  And I don't know.  Free spirit?  I did...  Like you're squatting?  I finally got, like, a CD slash DVD rack, too, because all my CDs and DVDs were just kind 
[00:43:00]  of thrown around the living room, you know.  On the floor.  Yeah.  Aren't you afraid?  Now, I know, look, I know you got a nice apartment, very nice area.  Aren't you afraid that you're going to put your pants or underwear on and, like, maybe  a roach or a rat, a mouse turd or something is going to be in there?  Not really.  No?  You don't care?  No, not really.  That would freak me out.  I've been wearing the same jeans for seven days.  But I'm not smelly or anything, you know. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  I have good hygiene.  Good hygiene.  I have good hygiene.  How did you...  Now, where did you buy this dresser?  I'm fascinated.  Just around my neighborhood?  You didn't find it out on the sidewalk.  No, no, no, no, no.  I've been buying nice stuff.  Yeah.  It's just been a very slow process.  I don't know.  Very slow process.  It's three years.  Three years to get a dresser goes beyond a slow process.  Yeah, that's beyond a slow process.  I understand.  I'm getting it together slowly. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  Yeah.  I am stunned that you just kept your clothes on the floor.  I get them cleaned and all, and then I just pile them up nice.  That's all.  And then when you need to get dressed, you just, like, look through the pile.  You don't have...  No, I have it kind of organized, you know.  Shirts, jeans.  Yeah.  In piles?  Yeah.  In piles on the floor.  Yeah.  Do you have a bed?  A really nice bed.  It's a nice bed?  Yeah.  But is it just a mattress on the floor? 
[00:44:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  It actually has a headboard?  No.  Are you insane?  You don't have a headboard-type bedroom set?  I have the mattress and the box spring and the little, uh, little, uh...  You have a metal frame...  Yeah.  ...that the mattress and box spring sits on, and that's it?  That's it.  You have no headboard?  It's not important to me.  No night tables?  No.  Where you take your change and put it out and your watch and put it...  This is stuff human beings do.  Yes.  But it doesn't bother me.  Where's your alarm clock?  I know you say you don't need it and don't use it, but where is it? 
[00:45:00]  No, I do need it because of the new hour.  I, uh, it's on the floor.  It's on the floor.  Yeah.  How high up is your bed?  Because I know my bed is pretty high up.  It's really high because I got the extra mat, you know, the extra whatever pad and stuff.  Can you see the clock from your bed?  No.  Of course not.  You're living like a homeless guy, shacked up.  I know, it's cool in a way.  It has that college feel to it.  College feel.  But really nice stuff.  A bag of marshmallows in the room just in case you really want that college feel.  But really nice, really nice stuff, though. 
[00:45:30]  I got a really nice, you know...  Nice stuff what stuff?  Sound system.  You need stuff to have nice stuff.  I have stuff.  I got couches, a leather chair.  I got some nice things.  I would think...  I bought a $500 piece of art, so I'm starting.  How...  Not art, though.  Art smart!  How about a bed?  It's just...  I have a bed.  But you need...  A really nice bed.  Having a mattress on that stock metal frame that you get from the mattress company. 
[00:46:00]  I understand with a box frame.  Oh, you want to just decorate it up nice.  No, it serves a purpose, a headboard.  It has, like, drawers and stuff in it.  And little sliding compartments.  I can't be bothered with that.  I don't have that either.  No?  I have a frame.  I have, like, a metal frame around it, like a metal headboard in a way.  Oh, that's nice.  I've seen those.  I can't be bothered with that, yeah.  My headboard has, like, cabinets on the sides of it, so let's say I have some Joey  Butterfuoco pants for walking around the house in, and some t-shirts in there. 
[00:46:30]  You get out of bed, it's right there.  You open up the little drawer there.  I can keep my DVDs that I like watching in the bedroom over there on the side.  How do you live with just a mattress box spring on a metal frame?  I don't have a TV in my bedroom.  You have no TV in your bedroom?  No, because I want to...  Do you, Jimmy?  No, but it's simply because I'm such a bad sleeper that they said only sleep in your  bedroom, and it'll make it a little easier for you.  I got you.  Yeah, some people.  I'm not going to bash you for that.  Some people just don't like having TV in my bedroom.  No, I don't like having... 
[00:47:00]  No, it would be cool at times, but no.  No.  I don't really have room anywhere in my room.  I'm just...  A dresser.  You finally got a dresser.  Yeah.  Yeah, it comes Friday.  Comes Friday.  It's a little weird, yeah.  Where'd you get it?  At a place around my hood.  Oh, just like a furniture store around your neighborhood?  Yeah, it's a nice dresser.  It's whatever.  Yeah.  It's whatever.  Yeah.  All right.  Three years.  Really?  That's nothing.  Oh, I can only imagine.  Keep prying, dude.  You'll find all sorts of crazy stuff.  I can only imagine. 
[00:47:30]  The kitchen probably never gets used, right?  No, I use it.  You do?  Yeah.  For what?  And it's stocked with food, finally, and...  Oh.  Yeah.  Would the mouse leave a list of what it wanted?  The mouse...  Cheese.  More cheese.  The mouse hasn't been back.  Oh, no.  No, since I tied it up in the three or four plastic bags and...  Threw it away.  Threw it in the trash.  Good job.  Finally got rid of the mouse.  But you had...  So you had food and...  And the place, you know, is really clean.  No, there's no reflection on the cleanliness of the place. 
[00:48:00]  It's really clean.  It sounds barren.  You know, I got the Polish maid to help me out.  So she comes in and cleans, and she piles my clothes all nice on the floor after she  cleans the floor.  Wow.  I know.  She looks at me like, what is wrong with you?  But I don't know.  The mouse probably didn't even know anyone lived there.  That's why he showed up.  He's got no furniture.  He's like, yeah, an empty apartment.  But it's empty, and someone had the heat on.  No, it's funny, and, you know, you guys will abuse me for it.  I'm prepared for it.  But when the Polish maid first started coming over to my place and saw what I had and stuff,  I could tell on her face, she's like, oh, great. 
[00:48:30]  This isn't going to be, you know, fruitful.  Oh, not much to do.  No furniture to move when you sweep.  Not even that.  Just like, oh, this guy doesn't have much, so he's not going to really take care of me,  you know?  Yeah.  But I really take care of my maid big time.  She leaves with a nice big smile, you know?  So I take care of her, but she doesn't have much to do.  Well.  No, she's a pig.  I know.  Well, she's a Polak.  What do you give her, borscht?  Here you go.  Take this.  Eat this, stupid.  Throw some poker chips at her until I get the hell out. 
[00:49:00]  The only conversation we had was, finally, because she's there for like four hours,  and I can't be there, because it's just a weird thing going back to, I don't know, childhood  or something.  I'm embarrassed someone else is cleaning up after me, but I can't do it.  I don't know, dude.  But I just can't keep the place clean, so I finally had to go down this road, right?  So we finally had a conversation.  She barely speaks English, but she's bored when she has to stay there for four straight  hours.  So she finally, we had this weird conversation where she was trying to tell me that she wants 
[00:49:30]  to listen to rock and roll while she cleans.  Oh, really?  So, you know, that music choice, whatever it's called on the cable, she loves the rock  channels, big time.  Primitive.  Not only can I be there when they clean, I have to be so they don't steal.  I have a little Chinese man that does it, and he used to come in with his wife, and  they're in their 80s.  A little Chinese guy comes over?  He's fantastic.  But I like to point out things that aren't done properly.  You are that guy.  I'm a gentleman, like, I don't know what his name is, he's been clean for three years, 
[00:50:00]  but I'll do something like this.  Oh my God, you do not slap your hands together.  And he comes in, and I point, and I go, ugh!  And he cleans.  You point and grunt.  Yeah, I kind of like put the backhand slap motion, and the little...  Are you...  Well, you're kidding to a point, but...  A little fella goes running.  A little yellow fella cleans up.  The weird thing is, I'm so thankful that I don't even, I don't even...  Sometimes I see something that you get done better, I have no way would I even confront  her.  But you're feeling guilty, dude. 
[00:50:30]  You feel guilty because you're doing well, because you used to...  You know what it's like to not have money, and you don't want to be elitist, but you're  not elitist.  You're a nice guy.  You're getting...  You're helping her.  You're employing her.  You're not being a scumbag.  Oh, I know.  I don't...  I...  When she first started coming over, I was, like, running around helping her out.  That's ridiculous.  I know.  That is really ridiculous.  I know.  It's weird.  Is it a wood dresser?  Yeah.  It's nice wood?  Dude, when I do buy stuff, I don't buy cheap stuff.  Yeah.  The problem is buying the stuff. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  You know, I spent, like...  I don't know what I just said, but about $600 on a really nice photograph.  Yeah.  That takes up half of my wall and stuff, you know?  So when I do finally buy stuff, I don't go cheap, no.  You stack clothes on it?  And you're painting?  It's a picture slash table.  Wow.  All right.  I have to get a can of pledge now for the wood.  Oh, well, the maid does that.  No, she does that.  Housekeeper.  And then she tells me what I need, you know. 
[00:51:30]  She'll point at stuff, like, more...  Now it's more work for her.  More this, more that, you know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, congrats on your dresser.  Thank you.  That's a big move.  Three years.  Thank you.  You just kind of walk into these situations and you don't want to lay down roots?  Is that it?  I like...  You know, you're kind of right, I guess.  You got to remember, my whole life I just moved from here to here to there.  Dude, I could sit here, maybe during the commercial break. 
[00:52:00]  Like, I think I've lived in over 20 places since I was 18.  Yeah.  Easily.  I could probably relate.  Easily.  20 places.  Mm-hmm.  So you're probably right.  I'm not used to, you know, putting down roots.  And then when it was time to move to go do another radio job or whatever, it was just easier to not have a lot of stuff.  Mm-hmm.  You remember when we moved to Boston.  I certainly do.  I came over with the U-Haul.  Well, we decided we were going to share a U-Haul because neither one of us were making a lot of money and they weren't really, they weren't, you know, they weren't giving us a lot of money to move. 
[00:52:30]  So, well, we'll pay for a U-Haul.  Gee, thanks.  So Anthony comes over with the U-Haul and in all fairness, Anthony goes, how much stuff you got?  I go, I don't really have that much.  He goes, just leave a couple of feet at the back of the truck.  Right.  I'm like, okay.  And I left like two feet at the back of the truck.  So he pulls up to my Northport place, which was just a shithole.  I had to take duct tape couch with me. 
[00:53:00]  So, of course, you know, that took up room.  Right.  I take my dresser with the laminate wood peeling off the top.  So he pulls up.  What an animal.  He pulls up.  He pulls up.  He opens up the back door of the U-Haul and there was no room.  I mean, you're exaggerating.  Maybe you gave me four feet.  Maybe.  There was really nothing.  And what did you see when you pulled up, if you remember?  I saw a lot of junk out on the street by the garbage.  That's exactly what I was getting at.  I think right when I pulled up, you were swinging your VCR by the cord from the front door and 
[00:53:30]  tossed it onto the curb.  Yeah, it was like Animal House.  My brother was over, I remember, and we were just smashing my stuff.  Yeah.  Just smashing it in front of the house.  Yeah, you really had nothing.  And it was just in a big pile because it was all junk.  You don't get attached to it like that?  Like, you can just get rid of crap like that?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This stuff was just junk.  And I moved up to Boston with pretty much nothing.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  I didn't move any furniture. 
[00:54:00]  Trying to think of your place there in Boston.  I'm thinking if it was furnished.  No, it was.  It was, right.  Yeah.  I didn't know buying stuff.  Look at Ben.  Oh, in Wellesley.  Actually, to defend him, though, his bedroom, the bed doesn't look that bad.  Jesus Christ, Ben.  And they're like, what the fuck?  I don't know.  Did he give me a roofie or something?  All of a sudden, he's like, well, to defend him, his bed.  What?  I got a PlayStation.  What?  No, but as far as without the surroundings of it, it doesn't look that bad. 
[00:54:30]  Do you have a bedspread type thing?  No.  Just a really nice comforter.  Oh, a comforter.  But is it a decorative comforter?  No, it's white.  It's just white?  Yeah.  What kind of sheets do you have for this bed?  Flannel right now.  A flannel sheet?  Yeah, no, I'm telling you, when I do buy stuff, I do buy really nice stuff.  The problem is actually going out and getting the crap.  Actually going and getting it.  Yeah.  No, I don't buy cheap stuff, no.  Pillow shams? 
[00:55:00]  What the hell is that?  Those are those fluffy things that go on your pillow.  They're awful.  This is where the audience figures out, who's living with a woman?  Pillow shams?  What the fuck is a shams?  Duvet?  Do you have a duvet?  I do.  I know.  Jimmy's got one.  I never heard of a duvet before Jimmy.  He was shopping for a duvet.  Oh, daddy.  I love it.  Daddy.  Oh, that's horrible.  Oh, daddy.  Nice duvet.  Yeah, well.  Hold on. 
[00:55:30]  Something to wipe their manly cock on when they're done with you.  Do girls love it when they come over little rocks and stuff?  They love that type of stuff.  Of course they do.  It's just set up like a nice Manhattan kind of apartment.  All right, well.  This is like a vacant cave.  Some clothes on the floor.  That's great.  I'm happy to hear about your dresser.  If you would have come over in the last three years, you would have seen this for yourself.  That apartment holds nothing but bad memories for me. 
[00:56:00]  I'm sorry.  Wow, the last time you were in my place.  Like the only time I was there was when we got fired.  This is what's so funny.  People just assume we just hang out all the time.  Like, I haven't been to Anthony's new place on Long Island.  You were there once.  No, I wasn't.  When I first moved there.  No.  You stopped by?  No.  Wow.  No.  You stopped by?  No.  Let me think.  No.  Another blonde boy.  Jesus.  Could have been.  I can't think.  I thought you would stop by one day.  Are you cheating on me with another radio DJ?  Oh, well, no. 
[00:56:30]  Did you just put your foot in your mouth?  Oh, no.  What radio station does he work for?  I could have sworn you were.  Is he one of those morning zoo guys?  I found this under your bed.  What is this?  I found wacky accoutrements.  No, I haven't been to your new place.  I could have sworn you were there.  And the last time you were at my place, and it's so funny because now they'll speculate,  well, this proves that they don't like each other. 
[00:57:00]  Shut up.  We get along just fine.  Yeah.  The last time you were at my place was when we got fired, right?  Yeah.  So that's two and a half years ago?  Give or take?  Wow.  Yeah.  Two and a half years ago you were at my place.  Yeah.  And all I could think of is standing in that vacant living room looking at that big screen  TV with all the news people goofing on us and saying how we're done.  And finished in the business.  And it's a very depressing memory.  Yeah.  And that's like, I remember sitting out in your backyard area. 
[00:57:30]  Well, I got outdoor space, which is unheard of in Manhattan.  Sitting at the table.  So, I mean.  And having to call, like, my mother and say that I'm fired.  And it was just awful.  You gotta, you know.  Telling her, like, no, mom, everything's fine.  Don't worry.  We're gonna be fine.  Everything's okay.  And absolutely not believing it myself.  Gotta, like, pump out that bull crap into the phone.  Yeah, I wrote about that day.  And one of the things I wrote was the last thing we said to each other.  By the way, you gotta tell me. 
[00:58:00]  I do have a nice place.  I don't, you know.  That place is very nice.  I'm just renting.  But the right person was in there.  It would be a great apartment.  I know, I know.  It's all nice and decorated and looking very Manhattan-like and everything.  I was thinking of getting someone in there to maybe do that for me.  Because I can't figure that stuff out.  But all your place needs is white sheets thrown over the furniture.  That's pretty much it.  Looks like one of those abandoned houses.  No, it's gotten a lot better.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's definitely better.  I'm gonna have to check it out.  The decorator, man.  Oh, that would be nice.  Come over and maybe say hi.  Come over.  I so look forward to leaving the island of Manhattan once we're done with the show that I find it hard to just... 
[00:58:30]  Somewhere along the line, you turn it to Howard Hughes.  Do you think so?  Oh, yeah.  I just like being in the suburbs.  You got your own problems.  I like the suburbs.  I know I got problems, but you got your own problems.  I like the suburbs.  I don't like boogers on my couch.  At this point, you pretty much hate people.  But not at this point.  I've always had a deep hatred for human beings.  But, you know, I could deal with them.  It's not like I lock myself in the house. 
[00:59:00]  Getting back to the apartment, though.  So, I remember watching all the newscasts and stuff with you.  And Bob was on the phone.  And he was trying to hook up a fax machine in my place.  I'm like, what?  Good luck.  Good luck.  I don't even know how you do that.  Hope you had a dial phone at that point.  No, stop.  And I remember it was time for you to leave.  I wrote about all this.  And I go to you.  All right.  Well, we did it again.  Hey, we'll get through this just like the last one.  We're going to get through this. 
[00:59:30]  Don't you worry, Anthony.  And we looked at each other like going, this isn't like the last time.  Good one.  This stinks.  And this is going to be a long, long haul.  A long haul.  And sure enough, two and a half years later, well, a little over two years later, we get  to do radio again.  So, you've got to move.  Huh?  So, now you've got to move.  I can't go back there.  Well, there's actually a lot of bad memories in that place now.  So, I'm thinking that, too.  I'm thinking it's time to maybe, God forbid, buy something.  Oh!  Yeah, I've been thinking that, too. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  Speaking of which, I know Jimmy's the one that buys.  Isn't that a kick in the ass?  We sit here for years and years and years doing our gig.  Jimmy comes on board for, you know, not really that long, relatively speaking, as far as with  us doing the show.  And he's a homeowner.  He's the one buying.  I had to.  I just wanted to not pay rent anymore.  Well, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  We do, too.  Yeah.  But for some reason, why the hell haven't we done that?  See, that's where you and I are.  You and I are similar in a lot of ways.  Yeah.  You just have someone helping you out these days.  Pretty big commitment.  Because you don't like taking care of the basic crap, either.  No.  I mean, I go a little more extreme, obviously, not getting...  But you didn't buy your own dresser.  Let me think.  Yes, I did.  Oh, you did?  I went down and bought my own dresser, yeah.  No one had to tell you.  You actually woke up one day and went, I think I'm going to go out and get a dresser today. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, because, you know, after the divorce, I didn't have a dresser.  I didn't have a bed.  I didn't have anything.  And silly me, I think if I'm going to get a bed and a bedroom set, I should get a dresser  to put my clothes in, you know, instead of leaving it on the floor.  Silly.  Call me silly.  But I figured I needed a dresser.  So, yeah.  Went out and got that.  Got, like, you know, table and dining room table thing and the couch that's now gone. 
[01:01:30]  I guess the point of this babble, we're far from becoming the modern day Metallica.  Yeah, don't you worry about it, kids.  We're pretty far away from offing the $5 million painting.  We're pretty far away from getting picked up in a stretch Escalade limo.  Black Escalade, yeah, limo.  And then make him believe we could relate to the common man.  Taking the Howey copter out to the Hamptons.  We're far from that, obviously. 
[01:02:00]  Hope someday to achieve that level of pompousness.  At least we'll acknowledge it when it happens.  That's the difference, if it does happen.  We are attempting the biggest comeback in radio history.  Yeah.  Hey, Anthony, I brought in the ABC news clip when we did get fired.  Ooh.  Ties into what we were just talking about, basically, with us looking at the, you know, everyone talk about us on TV.  Yeah.  And then we were talking about, you know, Dan Rather stepping down and all that and how everyone killed us when we got fired. 
[01:02:30]  Yes.  Except for Peter Jennings.  Peter Jennings was the nice guy?  I kind of defended Peter Jennings because they had an open mind at ABC when we got fired.  Really?  And then I didn't have the tape.  I couldn't give you the example, but we finally found it.  Eric found it for us.  Did you listen to it?  I haven't heard it in a while.  Because I'm trying to think maybe you're remembering different, and he actually bashes it.  No, no, I remember it was a fair piece.  I remember when it was done.  Well, he had experts on there that basically said that, I think, that people's society needs people like you and I, Anthony, to push the boundaries. 
[01:03:00]  Of course we do.  Of course we're there to push the boundaries.  Society needs us, damn it.  Sure.  Do you know how awful it was, by the way?  We had come out of Starbucks.  It was very rare that all three of us would actually go for a walk after the show if that never happened.  Yeah.  And I'm walking with you.  No, that's because we knew.  And we were all staying together that day.  We were walking to answer.  Because we got the, I just want to stop because I know where you're going. 
[01:03:30]  I just want to set it up quickly, the reason why we're all together.  We went to work that day, the famous day that they finally let us go.  They never fired us.  Just held us to this stupid contract.  Canceled the show.  They basically attempted to destroy our radio careers.  And they did a pretty good job.  I'm not going to lie to you.  They did a pretty good job with it.  But we were in our office that day, and we were starting to get a really bad vibe.  And we were sitting around waiting, hoping that someone was going to say something that would have put our minds at ease. 
[01:04:00]  Yep.  And then we realized, wow, we've got to get out of here.  We weren't working that day again, obviously.  And that's when we started wandering around the city together, which we never do.  You're right.  Walking towards your place, and we went into a Starbucks.  And I came out, and I'm just standing there with you two, and your phone rings, and it's Bob.  And you're like, oh, you're talking.  And you're like, uh-oh.  And I'm like, oh, fuck.  I just moved into New York.  And you looked at Anthony.  All right, they're canceling the show.  So, and it was just the worst.  It's over Johnny.  I almost threw up. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I am.  I almost threw up.  I had a two-year lease.  I just moved into my apartment, and they canceled the show.  Oh, God.  Do you understand how I hated God?  Do you understand how I cursed God?  I know people out there with cancer tell me to go fuck myself, and you're right.  I was in the shower cursing God.  Why?  Why, God?  A stupid dog.  I know.  Paul Machirio just backed over my lease.  A dumb little show fact that will make the Howard Stern fans very happy today, but we'll 
[01:05:00]  just throw it out there.  Yeah.  We found out that we got fired or canceled, what have you, in front of where Howard lives.  It was a coincidence.  All right, yeah.  Yeah.  A coincidence.  The Starbucks right there.  That's where we got the call.  I was so embarrassed, too, because I remember you guys were walking by, and there I was.  And you're like, what are you doing here?  I just had my resume out, and I'm like, oh, nothing.  I'm just kidding.  Then we took a long walk to my place, and then, yeah, watched the whole world pretty 
[01:05:30]  much trash us.  Except for ABC.  Well, let's listen to this real fast.  Let's listen.  So, finally this evening, from us bread and circuses, there have always been complaints  about entertainment pushing the limits of taste, including the outrageous ways that Romans,  the emperors, that is, entertained the masses.  Entertainers continue to outrage the public.  Yesterday, two so-called radio shock jocks were fired for orchestrating an obscene stunt  in New York's most famous Catholic cathedral. 
[01:06:00]  And again, we're asking, when do you cross the line?  Here's ABC's Dan Harris.  It's going to be an exciting Opie and Anthony show today.  You know how weird that is to hear part of our radio show on a national news broadcast?  Yeah.  That's one way to put it.  You know how surreal that is?  Depressing is another.  Show today.  When radio personalities Opie and Anthony got this couple to have sex, either real or  simulated, in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral... 
[01:06:30]  Wouldn't St. Patrick and the security guy is coming up to us right now.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Hey, come on.  Let them go.  They're okay there.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Shock.  It's the kind of stuff, the sensational stuff that people enjoy.  Yeah, I get off knowing people are looking at their radios in their cars and going,  Did I just hear that?  The church sex stunt stands out even in today's media marketplace, which many Americans consider 
[01:07:00]  a cacophony of crassness.  Uh-oh.  That's our, uh...  Uh-oh.  Uh.  Big word alert.  Uh.  Wasn't that the promos we used to use?  We're a cacophony of...  Shut up.  Cacophony.  Does that mean to...  C...  Cacophonate?  Cacophonate.  I like mine decacophonated.  Cacophony.  That is like an 1800s word.  What the hell are you pulling that out for?  Who the hell... 
[01:07:30]  That's right.  How many people knew what that word meant?  It was an 1800s word.  It is an 1800s word.  Tell that cacophony, I'd like some dinner.  You are a cacophony lover.  Cacophony.  Cacophony.  Crassness.  Whoa, Brandy.  Hubba hubba.  They're pushing me.  It's getting hot.  William Donahue, president of the Catholic League, led the charge to get Opie and Anthony off the air.  You know, there are some people in our society, I guess they get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope. 
[01:08:00]  You know what? Our society needs borders. It needs parameters.  On the other hand, Jeffrey Brown, professor of pop culture at Bowling Green State University,  says it is healthy to push the envelope.  It's not the end of Western civilizations. We know it.  Things are always shifting. Yesterday's taboo is today's norm.  But those boundaries have to be tested every now and then to be reestablished and to be moved.  He points out that in the late 1960s, when Star Trek's Captain Kirk kissed Lieutenant Uhura, 
[01:08:30]  is caused a stir. Today, interracial romance is widely accepted.  But the things we hear and see in the media now go quite a bit further.  Gorgeous breasts. I can't take my eyes off your body.  How the f*** you.  The debate today is whether the firing of Opie and Anthony will mark some sort of turning point.  Maybe some people in our society who are at the top have realized that even when there are bucks to be made, 
[01:09:00]  there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Maybe, but these shock jocks have been fired before after falsely reporting that the mayor of Boston was dead.  After all the attention they're getting now, including a rally in their support this afternoon,  industry insiders say Opie and Anthony should have no problem finding a new job once again.  Dan Harris, ABC News.  Well, the guy was right. We had no problem finding a job.  It just took years. 
[01:09:30]  Two years later.  Well, no, we had the job ready to go.  We had people ready to hire us immediately, but, you know, Anthony held us to this stupid contract.  So the guy was right.  At least we got a job quicker than you got a dresser.  So that was an acophony of bullshit.  That was kind of a positive report.  Was it?  An open-minded report.  Dude, back when that was happening, you were looking for anything to feel good about?  Like, oh, okay, anything that would look like it was going to change the tide? 
[01:10:00]  Oh, I know.  Yeah, when he said they shouldn't have a problem finding another job, I'm like, yeah, yeah, we shouldn't.  He said it on the news.  It's got to be true.  It was true, and Anthony knew that.  That's why they held us to our contract.  I know.  They were so paranoid that we were going to go across the street and compete directly with Howard on commercial radio.  Yeah.  That's the only reason they sat us for over two years.  Two years.  And paid us a lot of money.  I like that one guy.  Just to keep us out of Howard's hair.  Who was that one guy saying about, you know, you've got to have somebody out there to push the envelope?  Because things change. 
[01:10:30]  Ideas change over time.  What was taboo at one time isn't taboo.  Who would think, you know, in the climate now that sex in a church would have been a bad thing?  Because it's so acceptable now, in this day and age, because things have changed so much over the past two years.  What the hell was he babbling about?  Yeah.  Like, we'd ever fall into the category of, well, that was taboo then, but now it's just completely acceptable.  I don't think so.  Language-wise, though, look what you can say on the air now that you couldn't say back then. 
[01:11:00]  What?  Because it's satellite.  Well, you can say fun.  Yeah.  Satellite.  Let's not abuse it, though.  That's true.  Let's all calm down.  It's easy.  Less cursing?  Language.  It's still my home.  All right.  Let's take a break.  All right.  Remember King and Barber?  Of course.  They did some songs for us in L.A.  They're Tykes friends.  Yeah.  And it was pretty funny, but we didn't have a good sound system set up, and it was a little messy.  Well, they sent a CD of their stuff.  I hate these guys. 
[01:11:30]  Do you really?  No, I'm just kidding.  I don't know who they are.  It's good for a quick goof.  I don't know who they are.  I don't know what they'd do.  Tell them you don't want to play their music.  They'll understand.  Believe me.  Here's King and Barber, a song called Apple Trees.  One, two, three, four.  I got no Apple Trees on my ranch, but I've got a great big dick. 
[01:12:00]  Two apples hanging from a great big branch, but I come by my great big dick.  My dick's so big, it's got its own dick, and my dick's dick's bigger than yours.  Great big goddamn hammerhead effect.  It's so big, you gotta sleep outdoors.  I can't buy you diamonds worth of my paycheck, but I've got a great big dick.  I'll give you a pearl necklace to wear around your neck if you suck my great big dick.  My dick's so big, you go into the kitchen, make us cocktails every night.  Nearly three feet of sweet man, me can really treat a lady right.  I don't write poetry, conjure time and space, but I've got a great big dick. 
[01:12:30]  And I can sit across the room and still come on your face, because I've got a great big dick.  My dick's so big that when I was born, I thought I was a Siamese twin. 
[01:13:00]  Now I took my cock down into my sock below the middle of my ship.  Yeah, I like to suck my prick and jizz on my face,  Because I think it really helps my skin.  I got no apple trees on my ranch, but I've got a great big dick.  Two apples hanging from my great big branch, to come on my great big dick. 
[01:13:30]  I can talk about my great big dick, because I've got a little kiss.  I just love a drive in the country, laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramone?  Ramone, call 9-1-1. 
[01:14:00]  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Give me fuel, give me fire, give me double, tie this off.  Ah, it's whipping out Wednesday. 
[01:14:30]  Get that wow in your car and get ready for the wow season.  It's coming.  It's coming.  Wow.  I have a feeling when we broadcast tomorrow, we might see a few wows, Anthony.  Just a few.  Just a few, just to get it all going.  If you're going to be in the area, we're broadcasting live tomorrow morning, 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. on the East Coast,  at the Hard Rock Cafe here in New York City.  That's right over there. 
[01:15:00]  And then in April, when we officially kick off Wow,  will we start playing the wow songs and the little wow things we used to do?  Yeah, we'll have that in the older days.  We'll definitely have some fun with it, yes.  Yeah.  Yes, we will.  All right?  Way back when.  And we're going to have ladies start coming down to the station in the month of April  when we get back from vacation to, I guess we're going to have to extend it more than  just the month of April, because we come back, what, the 11th or something like that?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I guess we played a Paisano spot there.  We did? 
[01:15:30]  It says, nice.  You'll love Paisano, classic, good to hear Joey's spots again.  Very cool.  Did you guys still do your commercial reads separately, or were you actually in the same  room at the same time during these?  Hmm.  No, we did the Paisano one separate.  I had to leave.  So I ran in and read it.  See, it's happening.  And then you ran in and read it.  Why?  I didn't even hear it.  Can you play it?  Yeah, I have no idea what Anthony said.  Who gives Joey another one?  Yeah, Joey.  Let me tell you something about Joey.  Joey is a really good friend of the show, a very good friend of mine personally now. 
[01:16:00]  He was one of the first guys to come aboard the Opie and Anthony show back at N.E.W.  Yes.  And we all hit it off very nicely.  He has this great restaurant in Little Italy on Mulberry Street.  If you find yourself coming to New York City, go down there.  The food's great.  Yep.  He's awesome.  And I think he's doing the whole, you know, you ask for a glass of wine and you say that  we sent you and he'll give you a glass of wine, I believe, right?  But let me tell you something about Joey.  When we got fired, because we're on this theme of going back a little bit here, I guess, 
[01:16:30]  for now, and then we'll move on, obviously.  We got fired.  And what happened was the company started calling all our sponsors going, look, you know, they  got fired, but we'll get through this.  We'll give you a little deal.  Because they were scared that they were going to just bleed money, right?  Joey goes, pretty much said, if I hear my commercial during when their show used to  be on, I will sue you guys.  Oh, nice.  He went hardcore, said, I absolutely don't want anything to do with you guys. 
[01:17:00]  Are you saying, Joey, went to the mattresses?  Without a doubt.  Nice.  That's what I want to say right now.  I mean, he pulled all his spots.  He didn't care if it was going to affect his business.  You know, he was advertising on our show to help his business.  Yeah.  But that didn't matter to him when we got fired because we all became friends.  He's like, you pull my spots immediately.  I don't want anything to do with you guys.  You mean, that's the type of loyalty certain people of Italian descent have in certain  situations. 
[01:17:30]  Very loyal.  Loyalty is a very important thing.  Well, we found out through this whole thing who our friends are and who were just posers,  basically.  Yeah.  Some day, and that day may never come.  You may be asked to give Joey a little favor in return for that.  That day may never come.  You think?  You don't think I'm returning the favor right now with this free spot?  Are you ready to do your service?  But all I'm saying is he showed unbelievable loyalty. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Showed that he's a true friend.  And he made sure no spots ran, even if it was going to hurt his business.  And then he had a tough time after that because then, you know, he couldn't really find the  right outlet for his spots and stuff, you know.  So he just kind of sat and waited for the most part.  Yes.  Until we came back.  And now he's advertising on a national radio show.  Yeah.  So some dude in L.A. is going, why am I listening to a spot for Paisano?  I'll never be there.  But it's New York City and it's Little Italy, so there are plenty of people around the country  that if they ever do come to New York, now they know where to go. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  Look at that.  But I just want to acknowledge finally what Joey did for us.  I mean, he was like, nope, I'm with you guys to the end.  Screw them.  Right.  Pull my effing spots.  I don't want to hear them on your stupid station.  So, and then other guys, you know, you think they're your friends and they just, whatever.  Not that I lost, you know, I lost sleep over it, but, you know, guys like Jay Moore and stuff,  please.  I hear he's calling today?  Yeah, whatever. 
[01:19:00]  Whatever.  Go call Jim Rome.  We'll be fine without Jay Moore on our radio show.  God.  Let me hear the Paisano.  And others.  All right, yeah, so we record our parts separately, Anthony.  It's very exciting because we don't have many commercials, so I'm actually, I want to hear  what a commercial sounds like on our show now.  All right, Derek, stop it when we want you to, okay?  Go ahead.  Hey, like the song says, you'll love Paisano. 
[01:19:30]  A great restaurant right in the heart of Little Italy.  Huge portions.  Joey feeds us all the time.  It's a classic candlelit restaurant, perfect for a late night date or that romantic meal.  Every single pasta on the menu is now under $10.  At Paisano, mention XM Radio for a free glass of wine. 
[01:20:00]  Authentic Italian cuisine made from original, old world Italian recipes and the fun and romance  of Italy in a friendly restaurant.  Open weekends till 2 a.m.  Paisano on Mulberry Street, right there in the heart of Little Italy between Grand and Hester.  Call 212-965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Joey, welcome back to the program, brother.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Wap, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  Wow, that was awful. 
[01:20:30]  That was the most awful commercial I've ever heard.  We did our parts separately and then they threw it together like we were in the same room.  But it didn't sound like it.  It was like butchered together.  Yeah, they were chopping the end of the sentences off and everything.  Franken commercial.  That was really...  Franken commercial.  Paisano!  What an awful spot.  And I do believe I said, welcome back, you fuck.  You do a great disservice.  And I told them to leave the cursing in there.  That was awful. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  The end of the words are cut off.  Your level's different than mine.  We'll have to redo it for Joey.  What a horrible...  It's our pal Joey.  We're talking about how happy we are to have him back on board.  And we give him that piece of shit commercial?  Oh.  Doesn't even sound natural.  Sounds like we were forced to read it at gunpoint.  That's horrible.  We gotta redo that.  Yeah, we'll redo that for you, Joey.  Eventually.  You know how we are, though.  Eventually.  We'll get to that. 
[01:21:30]  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  That's right.  Anthony, I got something for you today.  Yeah.  Listen to this little thing.  Yes.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Gotta love the listeners.  They participate in this show.  I never thought Anthony rhymed with Socrates.  Ever.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony. 
[01:22:00]  We get so much show prep from our listeners.  It is like a people's radio show at this point.  Worse than the Paisano commercial.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  It's like he's drooling in the middle of it.  He goes...  Here comes...  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Who is this spit-sucking mutant?  I don't know.  Who made that?  Uh, P-Niggity, I guess. 
[01:22:30]  P-Niggity?  P-Niggity.  He's done some better stuff than that.  Wait, there's six versions of this thing.  Oh, great.  Are they all the same?  Maybe we picked the wrong one out, Eric.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  I love when they have to put the accent on the wrong syllable, too.  Socrates.  Just to make it rhyme you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  It works.  That's awful.  What are the answers?  Where can they be? 
[01:23:00]  Let's just ask Professor Anthony.  Professor.  Professor?  I have a professor on my penis.  He shops on Melrose like Liberace.  That's Rodeo.  What's your question for Professor Anthony?  Never even went down Melrose, you jerk off.  Who's Liberace?  This guy's really annoying me.  Who's Liberace?  Liberace.  Can we hear that verse again?  All right, hold on.  Please.  Yeah, listen to that one.  He shops on Melrose like Liberace.  What's your question for Professor Anthony? 
[01:23:30]  That would be really tough unless you, I don't know, dig them up and pop them up.  This is horrible.  I like the first one, though.  I hate it.  My old saliva mouth is having fun.  He's a high school dropout, but a true prodigy.  Wow, they take a shot at you here.  High school dropout.  He's a high school dropout, but a true prodigy.  Don't fear Professor Anthony.  Professor.  You are a true prodigy, though.  True prodigy.  He knows a little about lots of things. 
[01:24:00]  Used to have a fro, Professor Anthony.  What?  Used to have a what?  A fro?  Oh, used to have a fro.  Yeah, but it doesn't rhyme with...  Now he stopped even trying to rhyme.  When your elevator hits terminal velocity, it's too late to call Professor Anthony.  That's funny.  I'll give him that one.  Yeah.  I think we'll go with the first one.  Creepy.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. 
[01:24:30]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  That's the one we're going to use.  And it'll get stuck in everyone's head, too.  That's the one we'll use.  Maybe I'll talk about why the body produces saliva.  It's awful.  When you hear him say, and he's stogged in me.  Anthony, we played that there.  Sold him, Girl Scout cookies.  We played that there because Stalker Patty got involved with science. 
[01:25:00]  Well, it seems on Wackbag, the unofficial message board...  Wait, can I go to the phone?  Of course you can.  I'm a little distracted here.  Because Sally makes a very good point.  We didn't even comment on this.  Sally!  Yes?  What's up?  Who has a xylophone anymore?  That's what she was playing, wasn't it?  That's a xylophone.  Yeah, just sitting there plunking on it with one of those little balls on the head of a  stick and singing it.  Do you think he actually had a xylophone or he pulled that off the net? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  And just decided to make the tune to whatever tune he had on the internet?  It would be really creepy if he had those things you play the xylophone with.  They're not really drumsticks.  They have that big ball on the end?  Yeah, and with a marimba shirt on like Desi Arnaz, you know?  With the frilly sleeves.  Hey, good observation.  Thanks, Sally.  What a freak.  All right.  See, we're nice to women on this show.  Don't be scared of us, ladies.  Yeah, because she wasn't in front of you to call her a pig.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. 
[01:26:00]  Here comes Professor Anthony.  He is not, absolutely not playing the xylophone.  Here he is again.  I love the xylophone.  That's the xylophone played very well.  Got the brrrr.  Yeah, you got to have loose wrists to play like that.  Of course.  Limp wrist, would you say?  Loose limp.  Was Mike Brady playing?  Those were his ribs when he was coughing.  A little pee that Alice made for him, ricocheting off his ribs, making that sound. 
[01:26:30]  You need to make sure Jim and Jessica don't go anywhere.  There you go.  Apparently, Wackbag had a discussion about our little physics lesson that went on in here the other day  about an elevator dropping and what would happen to various objects or people inside that elevator  if it was just free-falling.  Would the object float around inside of it? 
[01:27:00]  Would it stay on the floor?  Is it weightless?  Does it have weight?  Would it hit the roof of the elevator if it was just free-falling or if it was pulled down under some type of power?  We had this whole discussion on that for some reason.  Well, Wackbag took it upon themselves to get together and have a little debate about this little physics lesson.  And who got involved?  Stalker Patty, whose name on the board, of course, trying to be incognito and not be recognized or get any attention.  Her name is Stalker Patty. 
[01:27:30]  Here she goes.  This is in her words.  In her words.  I'm not scientifically minded, but I like to experiment with concepts.  I took some objects and dropped them and discovered that a heavier object, a book, fell and hit the floor at the same moment as a lighter object, a beanie baby.  So, picture, if you will, Stalker Patty is in her little hovel apartment playing Mr. Scientist. 
[01:28:00]  She's now, you know, doing an ancient experimentation in her apartment.  Who is that?  Galileo?  Did Galileo do that?  Sir Isaac Newton.  Isaac Newton.  Jesus.  They've got to change the theme song to Opie knows a little something about something.  No, I know, but I believe Galileo did the experiment off the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  Oh, no.  Where he dropped two objects. 
[01:28:30]  Is Anthony right again?  Who is it?  Forget Aristotle.  Fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Stalker Patty.  Anthony, I want to openly apologize.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  I question your knowledge.  By the way, if Stalker Patty is listening, please call the show.  You know who I'd like to talk to even more than her is the poor guy who lives underneath her,  who has to hear this fucking dumbbell-dropping books and Beanie Babies on the floor all afternoon?  Shut up!  That bodied retard. 
[01:29:00]  How are...  Never mind.  She was dropping objects.  Yeah.  Now, ancient experimentation has taught us that it doesn't matter the weight of the object.  Gravity, they both react the same to gravity.  She's doing experiments that we did in third grade.  Yes, we did.  But the odd thing is, there were some people on Whackbag, one guy actually posted, and I was laughing at this.  He goes, as we all know, he goes, as we all know, a lighter object will accelerate at a slower rate than a heavier object. 
[01:29:30]  And I'm reading it, as we all know, watch!  Even Stalker Patty, through her in-depth analysis of this, came up with a different, a different, what would you call that?  Help me out there.  Conclusion.  Conclusion! Thank you!  I was going to go with...  I was going to say contusion.  I was going to go with hypotheses.  No, a hypothesis is different than a conclusion.  Yes.  In what way, Anthony?  Well, a hypothesis is just kind of an idea, kind of what you believe is going to happen, a theory, and a conclusion is indeed a conclusion, sir. 
[01:30:00]  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Thank you, Anthony.  I get knowledge every day from you.  Thank you.  Obviously, I have some competition here, because Patty wasn't satisfied with the book Beanie Baby little experiment.  I then tried it with a piece of paper and a book, and noted this time that the heavier object felt easter. 
[01:30:30]  The paper was caught up in its own wind draft, and floated to the floor, around three or four seconds behind the book.  So she actually knows that the wind resistance, the air affecting the piece of paper, changed the experiment. 
[01:31:00]  Is that the Mr. Wizard song?  Yes, it is.  Mrs. Wizard.  It would be gravity itself that should pull an elevator free-falling down a shaft.  It's the only type of shaft she has any knowledge of.  And that the person inside would be part of the weight of the elevator. 
[01:31:30]  It would fall as one unit.  If the person were outside the elevator, falling beside it in the shaft, even though both were at different weights, both would hit the ground at the same time.  If a feather, almost weightless, were falling next to the elevator, it would be caught in spirals of wind that would not respond as readily to the gravitational pull of the earth.  This is stalker Patty, mind you.  And she's wrong.  Both objects would not hit the ground at the same time unless they were in an airless environment. 
[01:32:00]  Right, right.  They don't accelerate at the same rate of speed.  Because a feather and a person, that's the same theory.  In a vacuum, it would work.  But in the atmosphere, of course, the feather is going to be caught up in the air and not fall at the same rate.  That doesn't mean that the whole theory is wrong.  The objects do.  It doesn't matter.  Their weight will fall at the same rate.  That's just the way it is.  In a vacuum.  Yeah.  In a vacuum.  How about not in a vacuum?  They won't.  If they're both solid.  If they're both solid, it depends. 
[01:32:30]  If something's as light as a feather and really affected by the wind, then they're not going to fall at the same rate.  If you take something like a hammer and an anvil and drop them at the same time, they'll both fall at the same time.  Oh, they will?  Yeah.  How about like a brick and a car?  A brick and a car?  It's like that big of a weight difference.  Fall at the same time.  Oh, they will.  If you drop them at the same time, they will both hit the ground at the same time.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Even if they're dropped from a height where the weight can really make a difference in the speed pickup?  It doesn't matter how high they drop them.  No.  Both hit the ground at the same time. 
[01:33:00]  I actually was wrong about that.  It's all about wind resistance.  That means you can't like hold them and try to, you know, then one hits before the other.  That's in like ideal circumstances where they're exactly the same height, they're released at exactly the same time, and in a vacuum would be the ideal situation.  But what I'm saying is the way wind resistance will stop a feather.  Yeah.  Right.  Will that wind resistance also work on a solid object to a lesser degree, like a brick?  Yeah, you know something?  It probably would.  The bottom of a car would probably catch more air than a brick would, and maybe that would, or the lighter brick. 
[01:33:30]  Who knows?  But in an ideal situation, in a vacuum, they fall at the same time.  That's what the whole thing is based on, not wind resistance.  You're talking about gravity, not, you know, an atmosphere and air affecting the thing.  So, I also tested some of this by putting a smaller object on top of a larger object, placing a wooden block inside of a larger frame and dropping it, and came up with my conclusion. 
[01:34:00]  Talk about what I did and learned.  Talk about the what did I learn feature of the show.  Talk about.  Yeah, that's what you're saying.  Talk about the what did I learn feature of the show here.  Please excuse me, I'm not a scientist.  Yeah, we were really confusing that.  But I had fun today.  She's in her apartment, experimenting with this lunatic. 
[01:34:30]  I love you.  What's with that?  Wow, Eric, that's not the song.  What is that, Eric?  God, that wrecked my whole bit.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, I see where you were going.  That's it.  Ah, we'll let Derek do it, Eric.  Right.  Thank you, Eric.  You're not needed anymore.  Derek does it better.  That's Eric with a D.  Thank you, Derek.  Derek knows how to find Thomas Doldy.  She blinded me with science.  You bet he does. 
[01:35:00]  A monstrosity in motion.  With her crusty clown face on.  Which, there she is in her apartment doing scientific experiments.  Science!  She's blinded me with her awful body.  Science!  So I dropped the book in a Beanie Baby.  Next, I'm going to try to extract oil from a peanut in blackface. 
[01:35:30]  There she goes.  Patty doing little experiments in her house.  And did you notice the last four sentences, she has an exclamation point at the end of  each one that really annoys me.  Oh, miss exclamation point.  There she goes.  I'm glad she has time to do this.  I thought she was working all the time, but apparently she has time to go home and do little  experiments.  Does she kind of figure out if the Earth revolves around the sun or if all the planets revolve  around the Earth?  Oh, how about that?  No, the Earth is actually just perched on top of a tortoise's back and you could fall 
[01:36:00]  off the edge if you go too close to the horizon.  Patty, I got another experiment for you.  Close all your windows, mix bleach and ammonia together, and breathe deeply.  Tell me what your conclusion is after that.  Her next experiment, she's going to leave her apartment and just start walking to see  if the Earth is flat and if she'll fall over the edge eventually.  Patty, try to reach the horizon.  Go ahead. 
[01:36:30]  Keep walking.  I like to see her do the R. Bud Dwyer experiment where she yanks a pistol on the paper bag in  a press conference.  Puts it in her mouth and fires.  Yeah, to see what hits the ground, the falling bullet or your brain matter.  All right, Patty.  We got some kooks that listen to this show.  So, Scientist Patty, they had a whole discussion on that on the message board.  Yeah.  Great.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates. 
[01:37:00]  Right here comes Professor Anthony.  Great.  Okay.  Very good.  I guess we got to take another break to catch up a little bit.  Last night I was reading statistics on black and white murders.  Murder stats.  Just popped it up on the web.  If you can only imagine where I was before I actually went to that site, that I had to  go to that site because I was so curious.  It was some Aryan nation site or something.  What's the big one?  There's like a real white power site that if you put white power in on, it'll take you 
[01:37:30]  right there.  Eatabullet.com.  Yes.  Eatabullet.com.  But I was reading all kinds of stats that blacks commit 50% of the murders in the United States  and make up 10% of the population.  50% of the murders.  Black on white crime, out of all the murdered white people, 85% of the murders are committed  by other white people.  So that leaves 15%.  15%.  15% of the murders of white people are done by black people. 
[01:38:00]  Black people that are murdered, 94% are murdered by other black people.  Only 6% of whitey is actually killing black people.  Did you just memorize these stats?  We've got to get those numbers up, people.  We're lagging behind.  Did you miss that?  Oh, yeah.  It's my job to know a little something about everything.  There you go.  Where did you see these stats?  Was it on the Aryan website? 
[01:38:30]  No, no.  No, I wouldn't take their word for it.  That's why I went to the FBI site.  FBI.org has crime stats all over the country.  But it was pretty interesting to go through race, age, sex, and see where these murders...  There was actually a murder committed by a 6-year-old.  Just one in 2003.  It was like age 1 to 6, 6 to 9, things like that.  It was one murder by a 6-year-old.  That's some kid. 
[01:39:00]  How you doing there, kiddo?  Murderer at 6.  How do you do that?  It's like someone needed a little attention when you're in the crib.  Yeah, it wasn't like an accidental thing or something, because those are different stats.  This was a murder by a 6-year-old.  That was a white kid.  A little white kid.  Well, this concludes this segment where you know a little something about everything.  Stormfront.  Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  All right, Anthony, we have another.  Very good.  Jeremy from New Jersey.  Great.  The Hitler-sympathetic guy is checking out white power sites. 
[01:39:30]  Red flag, anyone?  I go to all kinds of sites.  That's why you've got to listen every day.  It all comes together nicely.  What happened?  Did Metzger drop a little tear while you were cruising the Metzger board?  Come on.  Anthony, we've got another new sponsor.  Oh, we do?  We were talking about Joey from Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  We also have an ad for Babes Autoville.  Oh, they're coming on board?  Yeah.  I love them.  Want to listen to the commercial?  Sure. 
[01:40:00]  Bad credit?  No credit?  No job?  No down payment?  Get the f*** out!  You want a great selection on a new and used car truck or minivan?  Get the f*** out!  You want friendly service?  Service with a smile?  Get the f*** out!  That's right.  Get the f*** out!  To Babes Autoville, Route 9, Chelsea.  Hey, I'd like a new minivan, but I have dick for credit.  Get the f*** out! 
[01:40:30]  When I buy a new car, I expect good service.  Get the f*** out!  Come to Babes Autoville, Route 9, Chelsea.  Hey, did you hear what I said?  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Wednesday!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Get the f*** out!  Oh, my God. 
[01:41:00]  B-double-O-B, boobs.  There's a lovely young lady showing her breasts.  Boob, boob, boob.  Naked, shuck them.  Girls all over the country flashing their lovely boobs.  Guess how many boobs they started.  Can?  I don't have those.  You are spectacular.  B-double-O-B. 
[01:41:30]  B-double-O-B.  What was that on the instant feedback, Anthony? 
[01:42:00]  What tools?  It says, um, not only do we have to, yeah, we have to hear all the New York ads with that effing accent.  Ken from Philly.  We're talking about the Babe's Auto Villa commercial that we played, thinking it's a real commercial, first of all. 
[01:42:30]  And, by the way, that was a Boston accent.  Other than a New York accent, you Philly tool.  That's a fake commercial.  And it's a fake commercial.  You were supposed to get a little chuckle out of it.  That's it.  It's not real.  Speaking of Boston, you were telling me...  I've got dick for credit.  You were telling me in the back office there that there's a major problem with the big dig there in Boston.  Oh, a little trouble.  A little trouble.  This isn't, like, some stupid...  It's not Weekly World News crap, is it? 
[01:43:00]  No, no.  This is the real deal.  It says AP?  It says AP right there next to Boston, Massachusetts.  It's got to be true if it says AP.  It's got to be true.  Everyone knows about the big dig.  It took what?  I don't know.  Two generations to build.  Oh, my God.  Ten years over schedule.  Ten years over schedule.  Basically trying to...  $14.6 billion.  That's with a B.  Billion dollars.  Just trying to get all the lanes underground.  Yep.  And you ever watch some of the Discovery Channel specials on that? 
[01:43:30]  That I do check out.  Pretty amazing how they did this.  It's one of those things where it was supposed to be impossible to do.  You can't dig a hole that deep and not just have water pouring into it.  And they did it, apparently.  Well, they thought they did it, Opie.  Because here we go, Boston, Massachusetts.  The independent engineering specialist who led an investigation into leaks at the $14.6 billion Big Dig project  says he can no longer vouch for the safety of its tunnels. 
[01:44:00]  $14.6 billion can no longer vouch for the safety.  I am now unable to express an opinion as to the safety of the I-93 portion of the central artery, said Jack Lemley.  The project, formerly called the Central Artery and Third Harbor Tunnel Project.  What's it called now?  Buried Interstate 93 underneath downtown Boston and connected the Mass Pike to Logan International Airport. 
[01:44:30]  There's a lot of leaks is what's happening.  They have pumps that are supposed to pump the water out of these tunnels.  And it's supposed to be X amount of gallons that are pumped out on a daily basis.  It's something like 100 times that amount is being pumped out now.  The pumps can barely even keep up with the water that is pouring into these tunnels on a daily basis.  Because the walls are leaking. 
[01:45:00]  A lot of the fireproofing that they put in, these tunnels are supposed to be fireproof.  You look at some of the accidents that have happened in these European tunnels,  where a truck explodes in the middle and just barbecues everyone inside the tunnel  because the heat builds up and the tunnel actually catches fire.  Yeah, they don't need to worry about that, though, with all the leakage.  Just let the water in.  Let the harbor in.  Sure.  That'll work.  But all the fireproofing is coming off the walls.  And the walls are just leaching water right through them.  And it's flooding the tunnels.  They've had to close the tunnels a few times to pump the water out. 
[01:45:30]  And now, not just as an inconvenience this water is becoming,  but now the engineer, the engineer is saying he can't vouch for the safety of the tunnel.  That's got to be a real confidence booster when you're driving through that thing  that you don't know if it's just going to come down on you and fill up with water at any given moment.  He was an independent, though, right?  They hired an independent.  Yeah, they hired, which I think an independent has a lot more credibility than somebody that works. 
[01:46:00]  This, and we said it years ago, one of the most corrupt cities ever is Boston, Massachusetts,  as far as the police goes, as far as the government officials go.  Just one of the most corrupt cities out there.  They live in a whole other world.  They're not part of the United States.  It's like one of those small towns in Atlanta where if you got pulled over and thrown in jail,  it didn't matter making phone calls, nothing.  You no longer were in the United States of America. 
[01:46:30]  You had to deal with the situation.  You were in there.  That's Boston.  They have their own government, their own police force,  and it has nothing to do with what else is going on in America.  Just the most corrupt, the Mass Pike Authority, all those toll takers,  the nepotism that goes on there, the graft that goes on there,  and this project, $14.6 billion.  Do you know how much of that money went into pockets of people, of contractors? 
[01:47:00]  Ben won't tell you because he's afraid for his life when he goes up there,  but I really don't care about Boston.  Most of the times they did investigative reports up there during the big dig.  A lot of the big machinery guys were drunk off their asses as they're doing this.  They'd go to the bar.  They'd drink up.  They'd come back late.  They'd leave early.  We heard stories from Psycho Mark that truck drivers were coming in.  Oh, he's very credible.  He's a credible source.  Yeah, but you know something when it comes to Boston? 
[01:47:30]  I'm thinking maybe just a couple people were doing this.  It's not everybody, Anthony.  You can't say that everyone was getting hammered at lunchtime.  The entire workforce drunk.  And then driving around in their big rigs, hammered.  It's Boston.  Of course they're drunk.  There was probably just a few bad apples, as they say.  You think a few bad apples?  What does that mean when you're talking and Ben keeps mouthing the words mafia?  Ben, what does that mean?  Stop it.  Shut up.  Ixnay on the unultay.  Jason from California, what's up? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, how you doing, Owen?  Big fan.  Thanks, Jason.  Listen, I worked in the big dig for four years, and I was a truck driver down there,  a machine operator.  And you guys are right on the money.  It's kind of scary.  Not only were there a lot of guys that were drunk, but some of these guys were running cement  mixtures and stuff, working over 100 hours a week, sleeping in their trucks to get the  overtime.  And it was just unbelievable that there was total inadequacies of these people that were doing  this work.  And I've always felt that it was a disaster waiting to happen.  I don't even live there anymore.  I won't drive through the thing. 
[01:48:30]  I'm out here in California.  Dude, it's got to be tough to tunnel under an existing city.  I mean, there's got to be problems.  It's one of the biggest public works projects in American history.  Yeah.  In American history.  Look at the Hoover Dam.  Bigger.  A bigger project than any other public works project in the country.  And it's being done in one of the most corrupt states ever, where money was just flying  into people's pockets.  I want to go on record and say, this is Opie speaking, I think they did a fine job. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, you think they did a fine job, do you?  I think they did a great job with the big dig.  Perhaps if they paid a little more attention and actually a lot of the money went to where  it was supposed to go, perhaps all the walls wouldn't be leaking.  And when I'm in Boston, I enjoy driving through that tunnel.  As do I, Opie.  Yes.  All right.  Jim Norton enjoys it.  I enjoy it.  I think they did a fantastic job.  All right.  The leaks should be couldn't hear it.  And if I could...  Ben walked around, he herky and jerked into the walls.  Is that what...  Yeah.  That was a crack.  And if I could, I would pat them all on the back.  All.  And go... 
[01:49:30]  Job well done.  You can pat them on the back.  Find a bar.  They'll be on numerous bar stools.  Of course, that's Anthony talking once again.  You can just pat them on the back.  Anthony thinks you guys did a horrendous job.  Jason Green from New Hampshire is saying the whole fucking state is corrupt.  Let's take the central artery down and not improve the traffic situation.  Stupid motherfuckers.  I didn't say that.  I'm saying perhaps they could have done a better job and there wouldn't be all these leaks 
[01:50:00]  and you wouldn't have an independent engineer saying he can't vouch for the safety of the tunnel.  This isn't a little project that they could go,  Ah, we didn't notice there'd be some potholes here.  Let's fill it up with some tar.  This is something that...  This is a huge project.  And now an independent engineering specialist says he can't vouch for the safety of it  because of all these leaks.  And however, if the walls did cave in and the tunnel fell in,  it wouldn't fuck traffic up any more than it already is in Boston. 
[01:50:30]  Than it already is.  It wouldn't make it worse.  John from New Hampshire.  What's up, John?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hi, sweet tips.  Hi, John.  Hi.  I just wanted to let you guys know,  they stopped counting at 300 leaks on that big monstrosity.  300 leaks on the big dig, huh?  300 leaks.  It looks great.  I agree with Opie, but it's just a piece of shit.  It's just falling apart.  Is it almost done?  Oh, still years.  What's that?  You're still years away from it?  They've still got years.  They're still doing on-ramps and off-ramps and air ventilation systems are being redone. 
[01:51:00]  It's still going to take years.  And it's 10 years over schedule.  10 years.  When did they start this?  Oh.  How many years ago did they start that?  Like the 70s or something?  I was five.  Ridiculous.  24 years ago?  Exactly.  Well, 23.  Close enough.  All right.  Well, I think they're doing a great job with that.  I work with an attorney who left his practice to become a dump truck driver for the big dig. 
[01:51:30]  He made twice the amount of money driving a truck as he did as an attorney.  The unions will never let the gravy train end.  Okay.  That's another thing they do.  The tolls were supposed to be taken off the Mass Pike after it was paid for.  It's been paid for how many times over?  They will never, ever get rid of those tolls because it's just a money pit.  They love it.  They keep bankrupting themselves.  Well, speaking of tolls, they were talking here locally yesterday morning when we were getting ready for the show. 
[01:52:00]  They figured out that the average commuter to New York City spends $1,700 on tolls a year.  A year.  And Anthony and I started doing the math really fast in our heads going, oh, my God, where is all this money?  The streets should be paved with gold.  $1,700.  You know how many people commuter?  The average person, $1,700 a year.  Jesus.  You know how many people commuting in and out of New York?  A year, $50,000 at least coming in.  At least $50,000.  I think it's more than that.  It could be more than that, Jim. 
[01:52:30]  Why doesn't anyone?  Well, I know why they don't look into it, but.  Just more money going places.  Who knows?  Can you imagine $1,700?  The average person.  Should they ever have to raise the tolls?  And they just did again.  They just raised all the tolls.  What does it cost you now to go over the Verrazano Narrows Bridge?  $10.  $10.  What?  Dude, it's $10 to cross a bridge.  $10.  And where are you at when you end up? 
[01:53:00]  You're in Jersey.  Ugh.  Yeah, you don't even get to go anywhere cool.  You're in Staten Island.  Yeah.  But you're on your way to Jersey, because who stops in Staten Island?  That's a good point.  You just hold your nose and drive down the West Shore Expressway.  Shit.  Get to that awful Gothels Bridge.  Oh, Gothels.  Gothels.  Yeah.  Ugh.  That's how they pronounce it, I think.  The Gothels.  Is it Kosciusko or Kosciusko?  Awful.  Yeah.  $10 to cross the Verrazano.  It used to be $7.  And that was after they raised it.  No, no, no. 
[01:53:30]  It was like $5.  $5 for a toll is ridiculous to cross a bridge.  Doubled.  $10 to cross a bridge.  People don't notice it as much because of the EasyPass, too, because you're flying right  through it.  You go right through it.  You don't know.  Cha-ching.  Right.  And you get your credit card statement, and ooh.  Wow.  Holy mackerel.  Could have bought a dresser with this, but now I'm going to have to put my clothes on the  floor.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  All right, Anthony, we got some inside information.  Oh.  Yes.  We were talking about Mario Vasquez yesterday, the guy from American Idol that dropped out. 
[01:54:00]  He was pretty much the favorite.  A lot of speculation as to why he dropped out of the competition.  You say some gay thing.  I just think there's some chattering skeleton that's going to come, big bag of bones, fall  out of a closet somewhere.  Don't know what it is.  Gay, maybe.  And I said that some kind of record company got to him.  Yeah.  And he got a better deal if he gets out now.  And this guy writes...  I don't even know his name.  But he writes this email this morning. 
[01:54:30]  Mario is actually under contract with the show, American Idol.  But with a little inside info, inside info equals knowing a family member, this guy is saying.  I did find out that he is signing with a record company that doesn't screw him as much as American  Idol.  Yeah, American Idol, you were just their slave.  You know, they figure they made you out of nobody, so you pretty much sign your life away.  You do all these concerts.  They do tours, American Idol tours, where they take, like, the top 12 people that made it 
[01:55:00]  and pump them out onto the road.  And they go around the country doing their act to packed houses.  And I'm sure they're getting a mere pittance to do this.  And everybody involved with the show, the producers, make a lot of money off of this.  And he probably, or maybe, you know, it's still speculation, but probably got approached  by a record company and said, look, we'll get you a better deal.  I can see, imagine a bunch of these record companies probably sitting there watching the 
[01:55:30]  show going, he's good, she's good, let's approach them.  Get them off the show.  Right.  Well, especially if they know they really, really have something going on.  Right, yeah.  So this guy claims to be some kind of family member or knowing a family member.  He continues, he can't actually admit to it because he's still under contract.  Right, that's all I have found out so far.  Not sure if I'll be able to get any other info.  By the way, thanks for my four hours of entertainment today.  We all need it.  There you go.  To be honest with you, I had a thought and I lost it.  Oh, no. 
[01:56:00]  No, it was just something about the record company.  Can I read this instant feedback that came in?  It's hilarious.  Dirty jurors.  Professor Anthony, if I were to drop my wife an unworn child's body at the same time as  my neighbor's wife's head in a bowling bag, what would hit the ocean floor first?  Oh, well, that would depend on currents, various currents and tides.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony. 
[01:56:30]  It's growing on you.  Um, no it's not.  Anthony, we got some more on Mario Vasquez.  This is what he had to say on Access Hollywood last night.  Oh.  It's personal areas that I need to concentrate on.  I don't want to go into detail so much, but it's that gut feeling.  What?  Uh-oh.  Mario Vasquez dropping out of the American Idol.  Hack voice.  Um, nothing to do with my family, nothing with me being sick, nothing like that. 
[01:57:00]  You know, there's, basically there'll be lots of hearsay on certain things.  Lots of speculation on why Mario dropped out of the American Idol camp between you and you.  Huh?  Well, I don't know.  That's time to find out.  You know, I gotta take care of some things, but, um, I, I hope to be doing music in my life.  That's all.  So, um, you know, but again, this won't be the last you see me.  And here's the famous, that, your speculation, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[01:57:30]  Uh, he answers the question if there's some kind of skeletons in his closet.  Oh.  I think it's your job to find out, right?  If we tell you, then it won't be interesting, so it's, well, we'll see, right?  Well, we'll deal with it when it gets there, right?  I think that's the best thing for now, right?  Well, Access Hollywood is digging deep into his closet, and I'm sure a homosexual episode  will kill me out of yet.  Hack.  Puker voice.  I started watching the entertainment shows again for the show.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  To kind of, you know, be more informed a little bit.  Yeah.  And they don't get anything done. 
[01:58:00]  It's all just...  No.  They do nothing.  Nothing.  They do absolutely nothing.  They like, they like, uh, uh, talking like they're uncovering something, or there's some  big thing.  Quick edits and quickness.  Britney Spears pregnant?  Is Britney Spears pregnant?  Did her white trash husband knock her up?  I sure hope so, because she looks awful in the paper today.  Absolutely.  Really awful. 
[01:58:30]  A little chubby.  Uh, chubby, very soft.  Mm-hmm.  You know, I...  She's assuming that that guy's gonna stay with her?  What?  If she gets all sloppy and messy?  He'll be right there.  I don't know about that.  She got that Britney Spears money.  Yeah, but he's making a name for himself now because he's, uh, married to Britney Spears,  and she's already, you know, losing it a bit.  Really?  Yeah.  She is like...  Stupid Britney's gonna assume he's gonna be, uh, with her no matter what.  Yeah, right.  She was looking a little puffy.  Yeah.  Her legs and her, she had a little gut on her, and, uh, everything. 
[01:59:00]  Her arms and shoulders.  She's just...  She's not a skinny girl.  She got, uh, uh, one of those bodies that if she keeps in shape, it's dynamite.  But then you just take a little time off and you start noticing.  Yeah, she's gonna be a mess in another couple years.  What's going on there?  She's, uh, she's gonna be a mess, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  And then, uh, uh, the other speculation that I was trying to get to the bottom of by watching  these entertainment shows, is Demi Moore pregnant?  Ah.  Is Ashton Kutcher gonna be a father? 
[01:59:30]  He's gotta be the stupidest man alive.  He's got the world by the balls.  He likes, uh...  Eh, you know, it makes sense now, but, I mean, what, the kid's what, 24, 25?  25, 25 old broads.  And she's in her early 40s.  Eh, sounds good now.  Yeah.  But that time is a bitch, and he can be banging whatever he wants.  Cocktail waitresses, three at a time.  Maybe that...  Maybe that is what he wants.  Maybe he, uh, he's one of them guys who likes, uh, older women. 
[02:00:00]  Who's that, Brittany?  Well, she doesn't look bad.  She doesn't look bad there.  She's really hot there.  How old is that picture?  Jesus, I'd take all that back.  Look how hot she looks.  All of a sudden, now, she went from fat pig to, she's hot again.  What?  She looks very hot.  Is that brand new?  Yeah, brand new photos.  All right.  Shut my mouth.  Enough of these celebrities, uh, walking around with their tiny little dogs.  Now they got the little dog thing.  Is that her?  It's like a purse now.  Girls carry these goddamn little dogs around. 
[02:00:30]  Well, it's the trendy thing.  And then what'll happen when it gets old?  Yeah, they'll just, uh, you know, kick them to the puppy farm.  Kick them, Opie?  I mean, uh, they'll place them gently on the ground and say bye-bye.  I see a new service for Opie.  To the stars.  How many of these people could kick their dogs in the liver until they die?  You know, if, uh, Access Hollywood and all these entertainment programs want to get to  the bottom of some of this stuff, let's, uh, wait about two years.  No, not even.  Probably eight months.  All right.  And then you go to all these celebrities that were walking around with their tiny little 
[02:01:00]  cute little, what are they called?  Lap dogs or, you know, and ask them how those dogs are doing.  Where's your dog?  And I guarantee all of them are somewhere else.  Gassed.  Most of them dead, probably.  Yeah, they probably give them away to their housekeepers or something.  Yeah, they're not, they're not taking care of those dogs.  Why are you looking at pictures of her?  Do you like her, Eric?  No, it just came up.  That's why.  Who?  Ashley Simpson.  I think she's hot.  Stop it.  She's back to being blonde now.  Really? 
[02:01:30]  I think she's kind of hot, actually.  I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't know.  No.  Yeah, I like her.  If you're going to go that route, except for the dimple, or the, no, the clef.  Girls with.  Got a John Travolta thing going on there?  Girls with clef chins.  The clef.  I don't like that.  No, not at all.  No, the clef, I think, belongs on the guy.  It gives a place for the jizz to go.  It's just awful when it's on a girl.  Steve in New York, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey. 
[02:02:00]  I just heard on another radio show when you were on a break that if Mario stayed on through  next week, he would have to give 50% of anything he made for the next 10 years.  Is that how much it is?  It seemed like it would be even more.  Yeah, it was obvious to me from the beginning that, you know, he has the talent and someone  got to him and he's going to get a better deal if he just kind of backs out now.  50% for 10 years?  10 years.  Is the network not making enough on the advertising?  Jesus Christ.  I know you're giving these guys a break, but is that necessary? 
[02:02:30]  That's what their whole logic is, too.  Look, we pulled you out of a goddamn McDonald's.  And you're right.  They did.  But, you know, 10 years, 50%, that's a little much.  Come on.  That's awful.  Hey, can I ask you guys another question?  Yeah.  Can we take MacGyver Patty and throw her off a cliff in the car and see what lands first?  MacGyver Patty.  Yeah.  I hope you guys got that visual of her in her apartment doing science.  Doing science.  Test tubes all around, bubbling.  Let's go to Will in Jersey.  Will, who's that? 
[02:03:00]  Who's that naked?  New photos of Sharon Stone.  Sharon Stone?  Sharon Stone topless.  Oh, fuck.  Let me see.  She's so annoying as a human that it kind of, it makes her less attractive.  Yeah, I'm not feeling that, man.  Ugh.  Wow.  Whoa, look at how droopy it is.  That hind shot's a world of hurt.  Look how droopy it is.  Yeah.  That thing has a world of hurt on it.  Talking about her vag.  She's like, on all fours, like, straightening out her little beach blanket. 
[02:03:30]  Her beach towel.  So she's on her hands and knees, and her vag is hanging like a sack.  Wow, that's, uh...  That sounds flattering.  Will, what's up?  Say the least.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Welcome back.  Welcome back.  What the...  What the...  What the...  Who the...  Who the...  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  I'm calling you to let you know, why is Joyce...  Ashley Simpson looking like Joyce DeWitt?  Joyce De...  Wow.  That's a good one, bro.  That's not bad. 
[02:04:00]  Good call.  Just popped that up, and she kind of did look like Joyce DeWitt.  Can you put that back up there for a second, Hawk?  There you go.  Your phone screener is like, oh, is that a bad thing?  Huh?  Your phone screener was like, oh, is that a bad thing?  Not that one so much.  Well, the phone screeners always say interesting things.  Yeah, they're...  That's why it's the portion of the show that you don't hear on the air.  Right.  Because we wouldn't want so much fun and excitement and entertainment to be on the show.  So we keep it behind the scenes and selfishly gobble it up ourselves. 
[02:04:30]  Jim and Jessica.  What's up, guys?  Sorry to make you wait so long.  Where are you calling from?  Buffalo.  Buffalo, New York.  Buffalo, New York.  Yes.  Buffalo, New York.  Still snowing up there?  It's still snowing.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Shut up, Tony.  Wow, who is that?  Jessica?  That's Jessica.  Why are you calling her a dummy?  Oh, she's a dummy.  She's a dummy.  You want to talk to the guys?  All right, what's going on?  Tell me why I'm calling her a dummy here.  Talk to the boys.  All right.  Hello.  Hi, Jessica. 
[02:05:00]  We're calling because we want to have sex on the radio.  Oh, you want to have sex on the radio?  We want to have hardcore sex on the radio if we want to have sex.  And he's with Jimmy.  Hello to Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Hi, miss.  Say hello to Jimmy.  Hi, Jimmy.  Oh, hi.  What a domineering ass he is.  Say hello to Jimmy.  This is Jimmy, too, but...  Do it for Johnny.  What's it?  Jessica, are you guys married?  What's it?  You're married?  No, I'm not married.  Yeah.  You're not what?  What?  You're not what? 
[02:05:30]  What?  What did you say?  We didn't hear you.  You said you're not something.  Who's laughing in the background?  We asked if you were married.  What's that?  I used to have a hair lip, girl.  Yes.  I've had a bit too much to drink, Snape, but...  Do you have a hair lip?  What's that?  Are you married?  No, I'm not married.  You don't have a cleft palate?  I don't have any commitment whatsoever.  How long have you been married, man?  What about me?  You know, we're changing the program, and we're not really into premarital sex on this program. 
[02:06:00]  How come you're not married?  Yeah, why?  Because I'm into having fun.  Well, do you want to get married?  I never, ever want to get married.  I guarantee you.  You never want to get what?  No, because marriage turns into...  Never a piece of it.  Marriage turns into agony.  Yeah, but I know some people that are married that actually are enjoying it, but you're never getting married?  I don't want to only because I've seen my friends, my parents, everybody get married, and Anthony... 
[02:06:30]  You don't want to what, miss?  You don't want to what?  You don't want to get what?  I don't want to get married only because marriage turns into feelings, more feelings, and then nobody wants to have sex anymore, right?  And that's after you get what?  After you get married.  Do you think that married people have, like, sex less than people who aren't married?  More people that have...  More people that are married have less sex. 
[02:07:00]  People that are married have less sex.  All right, how old are you, Jessica?  I'm 23.  Okay.  And what do you look like?  I'm 5'3".  I'm 158 pounds.  You are not...  I'm...  How much do you weigh, really?  Be serious.  I swear to God, I'm 158 pounds.  I am a 48D.  I swear to...  48D?  48 is the number. 
[02:07:30]  I am 40...  No, no, wait.  I'm drunk, but I'm a 38D.  38.  I was going to say 48, the number is...  I swear to God, I'm...  Back like a cobra.  You're so drunk?  I'm 38D, but I honestly am...  5'3", 158.  That's a healthy height-to-weight ratio.  Yeah.  Are you made of lead?  Fuck you.  Hey, Jessica.  Hello?  Yeah?  Jessica, there you are.  Don't blow it, guys.  Don't blow it.  What did you have to drink last night and this morning? 
[02:08:00]  What did I what?  What have you been drinking?  Besides chocolate sauce.  I've...  Okay.  I've been...  Did you ask why I was drinking it?  Because I was drinking at Mugshots.  Yeah, Mugshots.  I love that place.  No, you've never even been there.  Fuck you.  I love that place.  Mugshots?  Yeah.  That's the place it's got...  Mugshots is a fire.  Dude, I totally have been there.  You know the place it's got that...  You've never been there.  I'll describe it. 
[02:08:30]  I've never even heard of it.  You walk in and then the bar, right?  And then the guy, there's that behind the bar.  Yeah, the bar on the guy.  The behind the bar thing.  They got that thing.  Is it the one on Delaware?  It's not even on Delaware.  It's on Transit...  It's off of Transit Road in the pew, but you...  Fuck you.  You don't even know where it is.  Oh, my God.  All right.  All right, listen.  You want to know what?  You want to know what?  You want to know what?  You want to know what?  All right, so how long have you been married?  What?  How long have you been married? 
[02:09:00]  Like 12 years.  You've been married 12 years?  Well, 12 years plus like...  I thought you wasn't married.  ...for like two months.  Wow, she's gone.  You are really...  Why do you, like, ask me how long have you been married?  Because obviously I haven't been married ever.  Yeah, see, she's too smart for you, Jim.  I thought she was married.  I'm not married at all.  All right.  All right, where's Jim?  I was trying to fucking flirt with you, but obviously you don't...  You know what?  I'm going to give fucking Jim the phone because... 
[02:09:30]  You know, Jessica, I like you a lot.  Jessica, I like you.  You sound cool.  Yeah, you like me as much as you like any other girl.  Who's ever been in here?  No, I really do like Jessica.  Vanilla Thunder from Philly writes,  Jessica is her ideal weight if she were 16 feet tall, so that's good.  You know, that's nice.  You got...  Honestly, you guys are the coolest guys before, but...  You got a nice ass, Jessica?  Obviously.  Yeah, nice ass?  And when are we going to fucking meet each other? 
[02:10:00]  Never.  Hey, does your ass show really nice in that little outfit they make you sumo wrestling?  Of course.  Yeah.  Whenever I ever sumo wrestles in a fucking outfit that haven't shown good before.  All right, are you and Jim going to have sex?  On the radio.  Yeah.  But, of course, because you know what, I swear to you, me and Jim just told me that  me and you are doing a shot to our disease, but...

[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Huh?  What a mess.  That was a mess.  That was awful.  Trying to reasoning with two drunks.  They're not listening.  That was frustrating.  I'm not drinking ever again. 
[02:29:00]  I'm not going to any local bars ever again.  That's great.  You just know that situation.  Drunken.  Drunken whore.  She's there all the time.  Sitting on the barstool.  Just drinking.  Free meat.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  It sounded like Stephen Lynch and Pike.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Jay Moore. 
[02:29:30]  Jay Moore!  When you run, you run, you run.  Jay, when you run.  Hi.  What's up, Bentham?  What the hell, Jay?  Have we just crossed our lines?  We haven't been able to get a hold of you?  Or what the hell is going on?  I've called you guys probably a half dozen times.  And it's the first time your moron phone sausage slapper didn't quiz me and then not let me through.  Because we figured you'd probably be one of the first guests we had on the show. 
[02:30:00]  We've been on for a year and a half now.  And your phone screen is like, hi, I know it's really you.  What do you do for a living?  Where do you live?  I said, come on, I'm up early on my way to a job.  What job are you working on?  And then I go, oh, fuck off.  And I hang up.  And then I left like a dozen messages on the FU line.  He never played those.  Those were, Jay left messages on the FU line?  I did, because I'd read it on my satellite in my truck.  And I'd be like, fuck you.  And I just, whatever, floated my boat that day.  I'd curse someone else. 
[02:30:30]  And then I could have got Frenchie like ten phone calls in a row.  Rumor has it you have XM?  Me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You do?  Do you subscribe to the Opie and Anthony show?  No, you don't, do you?  You just got real quiet.  I can barely hear you now.  Yeah, I can barely hear you.  What the heck is going on?  Can you hear us?  I can hear you now.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah, Anthony wants to know if you actually got the XM.  I've had XM. 
[02:31:00]  I had it before you guys were on it.  And did you subscribe to our premium service?  I did, and now I get it for free, so someone owes me six bucks.  Six bucks.  What have you been doing, man?  Having a baby, just kind of hanging out with my son.  We heard about the baby thing.  I got a divorce, made a couple tabloids.  Yeah, we read that.  We read that, and we're wondering what the hell happened. 
[02:31:30]  What do you mean?  Did it just, you know, kind of, the relationship kind of went to the wayside?  Because you two seemed very close.  You know, when you drive into a tunnel, it says clearance 14 feet.  Yeah.  We were, like, 14 feet and a quarter inch at all times.  Really?  You kept deflating the tires to get through that tunnel, and eventually you just didn't  feel like putting in the extra work.  Where's Buttercock Scotchcock?  What?  Where's Big Tits? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, where's Eat a Bullet Boy?  I'm right here, bro.  Hey, are you working anywhere this weekend?  Uh, yeah, I'm in Florida.  Where in Florida?  West Palm Beach Improv.  Why?  What's going on?  Where are you going to be?  No, I was just curious.  If I wanted to come see you, how would I get tickets, sir?  Oh, thank you.  Wow, come on, guys.  Yeah, well, we're used to the Jimmy plugs, but not like that.  Are you still staying out with me?  What?  This is what I went through with your phone screeners to get through.  Today was all right, but it's like getting an escort. 
[02:32:30]  He's like, what's your number?  All right, let me call you back immediately.  Well, this whole thing's been a drama.  Ben talks to this almost every day.  Okay, well, Jay said he's calling tomorrow, and then you don't call, and then, well,  Jay was busy doing this.  Ben didn't get in touch with me until Anthony was sick in front of me, so anything he said  prior to that is a lie.  Hmm.  All right, well, get Ben in here.  I got friends of mine going, how come you're not on the show?  I'm like, I don't know, the booker and producer never let me know how to get in touch with  them.  Dude, we need celebrities on the show. 
[02:33:00]  We wouldn't blow you off.  We need anyone we can get at this point.  Hi, guys.  And I don't mean that in a bad way.  I'm just saying we would have, we would have...  And Steve is Steve.  Jay didn't leave messages on FU Line.  That's what Steve's saying.  Get these guys in here.  That's a lie.  All I do is I drive around, I dial a stupid FU Line.  I said FU to Frenchie.  I said FU to the screener not putting my call through.  I said FU to you guys for having Voss on before me. 
[02:33:30]  Then I called back and said, really, FU for having Frenchie on before me?  Yeah, we expected you right from the start.  Yeah, we thought we'd start the show and the first call would be from Jay Moore.  Hey, did you really go to the Super Bowl with Nicky Cox?  Yeah.  Wow.  Is that your new squeeze?  Dude.  Yeah.  Wow.  How was it being in a tabloid?  Wow.  Whatever you read in the tabloids is true.  I love it.  He's not even denying anything.  That girl is a hottie. 
[02:34:00]  No, she's great, man.  She's cool.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's very interesting.  Yeah, we got divorced.  We filed like four months ago.  Was it a nice, pleasant divorce or was there anger and throwing things in?  No, she was a peach.  And I'm going to take everything from you and, you know, like mine.  No, you know, they say it's half, but it's not.  It starts at half.  It's like being with a bookie.  It starts at half?  It starts at half.  And then you get alimony and child support. 
[02:34:30]  So it's like being with a bookie.  You pay your debt and they're like, well, what about the juice?  Oh, Jesus.  That's got to amount to a lot of cash.  It's like 70%.  And what about the house?  Do you still live?  Did you have to get an apartment and she lives in the house?  No, I bought the house before we were married.  And I rent a beach house down at Huntington Beach.  So I'm actually, I made out like that.  But isn't that part of marital property, even though you owned it beforehand?  Or did you have a prenup or something?  Not in California. 
[02:35:00]  Really?  And you can have, I just want custody of my son, so you can have all the money in the  world.  I don't care.  There you go.  I'll go work Uncle Spudgy's chuckle hut.  And it only took four months to get the divorce?  No, it's not finalized yet.  It's not over.  Oh, okay.  Because you know Anthony's took, we were talking about this yesterday.  About three years.  Three years.  Big cakes forever.  About three years with Dominic Barbara as my wife's lawyer, so that was nice and fun  to have to deal with.  You know what happens?  It's like you're right about to finish up and then one of their girlfriends get in their 
[02:35:30]  ears and they're like, I need to wash your dryer.  It's like, well, come fucking take it.  What do you want from me?  Yeah.  You know, people start yapping to them and they give ideas.  Yeah.  You deserve that.  They got a divorce.  They got robbed.  Yeah, you deserve that, girl.  You put in your time.  You stuck by him when he was nothing.  Yeah, that old gag.  Well, she wrote all the jokes for you, right?  Yeah.  She did write.  She was like Rodney's wife.  She'd tell him into my ear when I was on stage and shock me with a prod when I fucked 
[02:36:00]  him up.  You know, Rodney's wife used to say, you ever see that when Rodney's wife had like the  IFB and she'd speak into a mic and tell his jokes into his ear when he was on stage?  No, she did that for him?  Yeah, like the last year of his life when he was at the laugh factory and he, like, you  just watched him to see if he'd kiss his pants on stage.  Oh, wow.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Hey, Wayne, it's a Friday club.  Don't tell anybody you're Jewish, all right?  Okay.  And she was giving him his lines? 
[02:36:30]  That's, I didn't hear that one.  Yeah, he'd wear, it's true.  I saw it with my own eyes.  My own eyes.  He'd wear an ISB in his ear and then she'd be upstairs, like, with a book of his jokes  and a microphone and she'd just, like, whisper them into a microphone and he'd repeat them  and there'd be, like, these awkward pauses in between jokes.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  And I was like, oh.  I had one of her tits during his act just to hear Rodney go, oh.  Would she tell him the whole joke or just key it? 
[02:37:00]  I don't know.  I just saw her speaking into the mic.  It was very, uh.  Why were they allowing him to work at that point?  Huh?  Why were they allowing him to work at that point?  Someone should have stepped in and said, look, man, you know.  It's Wally Sparks, dude.  She's pumping every penny out of him.  Are you going to tell Wally Sparks she can't take the stage?  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I guess you're right.  There's a lot of changes in your life there, Jay.  Hey, Jay, last comic standing, they did, I mean, obviously I was with you there on season  two for a little while.  Uh, season three, they seem like they kind of just jumped right into it. 
[02:37:30]  Are they going to do anything with that or are they kind of wreck it by doing that?  They wrecked it and we didn't want to do it.  And they said when friends and, um, Frasier were gone and they needed something for the  fall and they asked us to do last comic standing, but a different version of it with no house.  Yeah, the house is like the fun part.  I said, well, that's evening at the improv.  Yeah.  They said, yeah, yeah, it's good, it's good.  And they're like, no, it's terrible, it's terrible.  Like, can you imagine like The Apprentice, like a month later, you bring back all the 
[02:38:00]  losers from The Apprentice, like with no boardroom.  It was just stupid.  They just work and you film them working?  And so then, um, then they canceled it with a week to go.  I was like, you guys are fucking brilliant.  They wrecked the franchise.  They really wrecked.  We all know it's because a black guy won and NBC can't have a black person winning a  reality show.  Oh, is that a...  Uh-oh.  Oh, dude.  Oh, buddy.  I feel bug nice right now, son. 
[02:38:30]  Are you playing in the area?  I'm hearing rumors.  No, no tickets got sold to the promoter at the cancel.  Oh, come on.  Where?  It was at the State Theater in New Brunswick and the State Theater in Easton, Pennsylvania  on my tour of theaters only called State.  Oh, God damn.  You missed me, didn't you?  Yeah, we did.  You know something.  Everyone was bashing you.  I know.  I listened to it all and I just sat through it and said, you know, the light, the sunshine's 
[02:39:00]  a good cleaner.  The sun will come out and everything will be cleaned up.  You know our listeners.  They don't forget anything.  They don't put anything down.  And they're brutally loyal to this program.  A couple of guys.  Let's see.  Roast this fucker for taking so long.  Don't go easy on him.  Shut up, Jay.  Hang up the phone, you skank.  Hey, remember that one?  Hang up the phone, you skank.  Slow my fingers, it's shit. 
[02:39:30]  Is Jay ever coming into the studio?  Get Jay more off the phone.  Like they're angry that you didn't stop in sooner.  Sometimes they're angry I stopped in at all.  I got to say in defense of Jay, it's like, look, everyone wanted Jay to call in sooner,  but he did have a lot of shit going on.  And when you're going through a divorce, it's not exactly easy that, you know, and you're  fighting for custody.  It's, you know, your first priority is not to call into a radio show.  But I did call, and that's the thing.  I was guest hosting, like, the Roger Lodge fucking extravaganza or whatever, like some 
[02:40:00]  sports talk show out in L.A.  And I was, like, sitting on the toilet, like, 20 minutes before I was going to go on the  air.  It's like the only time I'm ever awake when it's dark out.  And I don't know if it was Eric or whoever, they're like, how do I know it's really you?  I'm like, it's me.  Well, what are you working on?  I was like, come on, dude.  They did not do that to you.  So, like, the more questions he asked me, the more time I would have had to be with  the guy.  I thought I heard.  I heard a lot of people, the phone screen, it was giving him a lot of grief. 
[02:40:30]  They should just, you know, put him through it.  Put him through it.  If it wasn't Jay anyway, it would make for good radio.  We would know it.  We would know it in a second.  Where's Steve saying I didn't call the FQ line?  Yeah, where's Steve?  Where's Ben?  Everyone's hiding.  Yeah, they went for the help because they don't fucking write.  Ben has no problem starting all sorts of rumors, but we're trying to get him in here,  and he's just sitting at his computer.  Make him believe that he doesn't hear us right now. 
[02:41:00]  Now, Steve has entered the studio with his blonde hair, blonde locks.  Anthony, how did you do in the poker thing, Anthony?  In the poker thing?  I did all right.  You know, I sat at a table.  I couldn't have gotten one of the tables with, like, celebrities.  I sit at a table, and it's full of poker pros, superstars.  You, the executioner, and Amarillo Slim.  It was the worst, so I was sitting there.  I did all right.  I lasted a few hours.  It was a hell of a lot of fun.  You said all you wanted to be was not the first one out.  Not the first one out, and I wanted to have a good hand. 
[02:41:30]  You were the destroyer.  That's it.  I wanted to have a couple of good hands against the pros.  Ed Asner called it opiate destroyer.  Oh, wasn't that great?  Ed Asner was cursing me out.  Lose the wasp.  Get rid of the fucking wasp, he said.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Okay, Lou.  Well, we have Steve in the studio.  Yeah.  You know, we got calls from Billy, La Machine, telling us that Jay had called the FU line,  and Ben and I and Eric went through maybe a hundred of these messages going back four 
[02:42:00]  days at a time, and we couldn't find a single one that even remotely sounded like Jay.  Billy called me and said, they want to know what you said so they can find it faster.  Yeah.  How is that?  Is it like an email?  Yeah, it's exactly what it is.  We're looking through audio clips that are sent in via email.  That's how the voicemails work.  Well, perhaps, Jay, you didn't say fuck enough times in the FU line message for Steve to put  it on.  You know, every message... 
[02:42:30]  Would the project matter be Jay Moore?  What?  Yeah.  What did I say?  Yeah, the key word would have been Jay Moore.  No.  Then we didn't find a single one, and we all looked.  And now we got Ben in the studio.  Now Ben is ready to confront Jay Moore.  I'm not confronting Jay.  Jay's just hard to get a hold of.  And he calls me back.  You call back like a week later.  I called and called...  Guys, you understand.  I've been calling this show probably twice a week for however long you've been here.  Wow.  No.  No?  Steve says no. 
[02:43:00]  It's not like Ben and I would actively cockblock this guy's appearance.  We have no motive in that regard.  Why would we do that?  Why don't you want Jay on this show?  I mean, I don't get it.  Why would we...  We've wanted Jay since the first day.  We wanted Jay to be one of the first guests.  Why are you not calling him back?  If you were a comic, Steve.  Jesus Christ.  Pimp hand.  Pimp hand.  Anthony, you know divorce is like the worst, right?  Ugh.  Stinks.  But did you have that like when you're going through it, that moment of clarity where you  realized everything was going to be fine?  Um, no, I'm still not through that as I write my checks every three months as I sign that 
[02:43:30]  check.  Oofa.  I did not want to get divorced.  Like I had like this whole thing about a two-parent household and how important it is  to the child.  And then I was on, um, staying at this little house on the beach and, um, I was with this  Argentinian girl.  And I was banging her and she goes, fuck me like I'm bad.  And I go, all right.  And I like smack her ass and she goes, she turns around, it was fucking her doggy style.  She turns around and she goes, no, fuck me like I'm bad. 
[02:44:00]  And she spits on my stomach.  Wow.  And I go, okay, you little fucking bitch.  And I start fucking her and I'm like kind of choking her, you know?  And her eyes are kind of bugging out of her head and I had issues, uh, you know, rage  issues with women at the time anyway.  Of course.  And, uh, then I had like my fingers in her mouth, like some, like I was going bleh, like  I was making a face, like pulling her cheeks apart with my fingers.  Yeah.  And I'm fucking her and I'm pulling her hair and then I pulled out and I came in her  face and I thought to myself, this just might work. 
[02:44:30]  This might be my new pass.  You're giving her the fish hook.  Yeah, it was both hands.  It was rape, actually.  Oh, God.  Damn.  Oh, that is funny.  How hot was she?  She's pretty hot.  Yeah, of course.  You're calling from L.A., Jay?  Huh?  You're calling from L.A.?  No, Argentina, dude.  Like a little pig from Argentina.  No, I mean.  When are you going to be in New York? 
[02:45:00]  I'm not now.  I have to cancel these dates.  I don't know when I'm coming back.  You really had to cancel?  Yeah, I had like 30% of the tickets sold and the promoter's like, I'm going to take a bet.  What happened?  Uh, I don't know.  Comedy's not big in Easton, unless your name's Larry Holmes.  The Easton Assassin.  Doesn't Larry Holmes look like when Billy Crystal does the old Jew makeup?  The lips. 
[02:45:30]  That's good.  Hey, how about on the Oscars when Robin Williams did a fucking Elmer Fudd impression?  Oh, it was awful, wasn't it?  Stop.  Like, I was always kind of non-partial and I never got involved in the he's good, he's  bad argument.  Yeah.  And then I just went, you suck cock.  Big elephant dick.  But they were applauding him like crazy for that act.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh my God.  I think he did that evening at the improv when Gordon jump-hosted.  Wow.  This is an old hack now. 
[02:46:00]  I actually enjoyed it and it's funny.  Shut up.  My managers and I watched it and we had a nice laugh together.  Oh, the common manager that you share with him?  You phony.  Jim's manager, Reuben Kincaid.  Hey, Danny.  Nothing.  I laughed.  Oh, it's hacky.  I laughed, though.  It's early for me.  I woke up to piss and then I said, you know what?  Where's the hotline?  La Machine gave me the hotline.  Billy Mac gave me the hotline yesterday.  La Machine.  Are you going to remember?  So yesterday I got the new hotline and I'm calling today. 
[02:46:30]  Are you going to remember even calling us later today?  Oh, yeah.  I'm not Steve-O.  Oh, you heard of Steve-O?  I hear every day.  It's my favorite, dude.  You guys are my boys.  That guy's out of his mind.  I love that goddamn show, that Wild Boys show.  Yeah.  It's hysterical.  They send him off.  I've never seen it.  Oh, it's on MTV, too.  They send Steve-O and that other guy.  What's his name?  Chris Pontius.  Joe.  Pontius.  Pontius.  And they send him off to, like, Africa and South America to do things with animals. 
[02:47:00]  Like, you would think Marlon Perkins, the old Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.  They do it, but only instead of just hanging out and filming them, they're, like, smacking  animals in the face and eating their crap and trying to pull dingleberries off their  asses, getting kicked in the face, getting ripped.  One time, Steve-O put a fish in his ass and had a pelican, like, pecking at it, and it  just grabbed his ass cheek and ripped it.  And he's screaming, enough with that fucking bird.  It's hysterical.  The guy's completely out of his mind. 
[02:47:30]  I finally saw Jackass the movie.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Oh, it's hysterical.  That scene, when they're on the golf course with those air horns, dude, I never get to  laugh out loud.  That made me fucking laugh.  I howled watching that.  Oh, just pissing those golfers off.  Grrrr.  And an awful air horn.  Grrrr.  I do that with the car horn on every golf course I pass.  I did it yesterday with the car horn.  I took my son to the zoo, and you got to go past the Griffith Park, there's like a golf  course there on the way.  Yeah.  And guys are just lined up on their tee shots, and I heard blaring the horn at him. 
[02:48:00]  It is fun to do.  How old is your son?  Two and a half.  Oh, cool.  Two and a half already.  We've been off the air a long time.  Jesus.  Holy crap.  Six, six, four, two, twenty.  I remember the announcement on our program.  He's a big fuck.  Is he?  Yeah.  I was at the zoo, and the gorillas are closed because it's under construction, and  you know when you have construction, you put the wall up to get those little circles  so the guys can like peek through the holes, just look at the trucks and stuff?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  And the entire construction crew was black.  Oh, stop it.  And then on lunch break, and like the biggest, baddest one was like sitting on a cooler, like  facing the other way, like one of them always does.  I remember thinking to myself, they have to know.  Oh, my God.  Like, they have to know how ridiculous this is.  Like, they're just sitting there, like, one space and the other way, two are arguing.  Oh, that is wrong. 
[02:49:00]  One's asshole is turned inside out.  It's like a linen clothes, except with orange vests.  Oh, is that horrible?  I'm so glad you're on satellite.  That is horrible.  I wish I got the stock before it was at $29.  This is why we moved the show, by the way, so we can get our calls in from L.A.  Yeah, that's right.  Hey, um.  Yeah?  A serious stock is at, like, $5.  Yeah, it went up.  It had a little bump, and then it went back down again. 
[02:49:30]  Like, everyone gave it to Howard, Mel Carmers, and bump up to, like, $9.  And then, uh, boom.  I had a radio tour that I did for these two dates.  It didn't work, obviously.  But the last one was, um, serious, and I blew it off.  So when I spoke to you guys, I could say, nope.  Didn't do it.  I could not go on serious before I talked to you guys.  Where'd you cancel?  Just Easton and New Brunswick?  That's not that bad, two things?  Those are the only two dates I had.  I don't go out anymore.  Oh, okay.  No?  Why would you?  Yeah, you got to stay home with Nicky. 
[02:50:00]  Would you?  Oh.  Why do you want to leave that?  Damn, man.  How cool is that, Jay?  Come on.  Come on.  How pissed was Bobcat?  I don't know, dude.  I don't get involved.  Dude, you got involved, though.  That's what happened.  I don't know nothing, man.  I don't know nothing.  All right.  Don't give me the money, man.  Don't give me the money.  Give it to him.  You're going to fuck me, you're going to fuck him.  Come on.  Let us live your life for one minute.  How is it?  She's so hot that sometimes I lose my erection.  That's what happened to you, girl. 
[02:50:30]  Come full circle, huh?  No, it's never happened to me.  I've never had a chick that hot.  So hot, like, my dick kind of goes, what's going on here?  Time out.  Let's fuck this over.  This is like, she's throwing like 101 here.  It feels it's not even worthy.  Yeah, and that's never happened to me before.  Wow, that's awesome.  Was she still going out with Bobcat, though, when you moved in there?  No. 
[02:51:00]  No?  They moved out and done their thing.  They were done?  Yeah.  Yeah, the tabloids had a little field day with that one.  I like Jay Moore's Bizarre Love Triangle.  Love Triangle.  So, Jay.  Yes, sir.  You've got to come clean now.  Did you or did you not have sex with chocolate live on our show that day?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  You know, it was in a Jason's studio.  The glass was really thick.  It was kind of dark in there, but we thought we were seeing it. 
[02:51:30]  We never got to the bottom of that one.  Jay did.  Yeah, no.  I fogged up the glass.  Those are before the New York Times over the Windows days.  Yeah, it was in Scotso's old studio.  Scott Muni.  God rest his soul.  Did he die?  Yeah, Scotso passed on to the great DJ Booth in the Sky.  Scott Muni.  He split the lid out.  Hey, do you still...  This studio smells like ass.  What happened?  Scott Muni sounds like the guy with the voice box in South Park. 
[02:52:00]  Do you still do Chris Penn?  Yeah.  That's probably my favorite impression that anybody does.  And no one does that impression.  That's why I love it.  I don't care how mad you want to be in this side.  Half of the day is going to be in us.  Let's move some cars.  It looks like Sam's fucking hot car all up there.  There was a girl who looked at one of daddy's calls.  This black chick called herself Lady E.  Was he pissed off?  I love Keitel in Reservoir Dogs. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  Tim Roth is shot.  And Buscemi goes,  Holy shit, is it bad as opposed to good?  Or bad lieutenant.  Gentlemen, this series must go seven games.  The revenue money alone between those two towns.  Leave it on the mix.  Strawberry is going to break out.  I went to the game yesterday.  And I looked out Strawberry in his eyes. 
[02:53:00]  And he fucking told me.  He's saving it all for the big one.  Wow.  That is really good.  I don't know any other way.  Leave it on the mix.  Did I see you wrong?  Good.  You owe me money.  Fucking, no one does Harvey Keitel and Chris Perry.  That is right on the money.  No one does that.  I love the crazy logic.  And then the fucking cops go,  All right, fuck it. 
[02:53:30]  I'm in.  He's like, I saw Dastro, man.  I put him in his eyes.  All right, you know what?  I didn't know that.  All right, fuck it.  I'm in.  All right, fuck it.  I'm in.  Goddamn, that is funny.  Women get raped every day.  Now, because these two wear penguin suits,  the church puts up a big reward.  The church is a record.  Are you a Catholic?  I'm a fucking Catholic.  I'm blessed.  You know what I'm saying?  This guy's going to blow up your house  with your family in it.  God, you'll be doing me a fucking favor. 
[02:54:00]  Daniel, you'll be doing me a good job.  I'm doing it.  Holy shit.  Good life.  Good life, Daniel.  Good life.  Chris Penn and Penn Penn.  A couple beautiful girls.  What were you, from a Kit Kat club?  A couple beautiful girls in your daddy's car?  Turn?  I know what you did.  A couple beautiful girls.  I like when you're actually seeing Jay do the Chris Penn one,  and you actually spit like he does. 
[02:54:30]  You're going to tell me this guy's going to decide?  Out of the fucking mood.  Why are you telling me what I'm doing?  I'm hilarious.  Don't point that gun at my daddy.  Hey, daddy.  What the hell for all?  That lump of shit's working for the OOTD.  Joe, I don't know what you think you know,  but you're wrong.  He's a good kid.  He got shot in the gut. 
[02:55:00]  It's my fault he got shot in the gut.  I know all the dialogue.  That's great.  Are you going to balk all day, little buggy,  or am I going to be on a sitcom on basic cable in three years?  What was that?  Because I didn't catch it.  Am I going to be on toast for $15,000 a week?  What a zilf, Michael Madsen.  Oh, shit. 
[02:55:30]  And we're both again.  West Palm, info.  Oh, West Palm this weekend.  I wanted to watch you perform.  Tell your jokes.  There were a couple beautiful girls in the audience.  God damn.  It's very similar to Colin, actually, could I tell.  I have my ass off.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that is fucking hilarious.  Colin, you're like, Jim, you know,  that's the only thing you're performing at West Palm with Jim Norton. 
[02:56:00]  A bunch of people sitting around,  it's good, I'm with Bubba the Love Sponge from Jim Norton on stage.  Oh, Colin.  You know?  I almost got a fight with Bubba the Love Sponge in studio.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  Why did you try to take his bag away from him?  He kept playing, like, these song parodies with the word nigger in them.  Really?  And he would dump it out, but, like, all the listeners and everyone on hold could, like,  hear it, and everyone in the studio is, like, cackling, laughing. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  I'm like, dude, it's just, it's not cool.  It's just not good.  It can't do it.  He's like, oh, what are you going to do?  And they speak in, like, this bizarre language called fat.  Jay, what was the problem?  No, that's when it was fun.  It's when he stopped.  Oh, because then he stopped and there was no more fun.  I like how...  My road manager's black and my godson's black.  I'm like, did I just, you know, like, in high school I would have loved it,  but now it's different.  Well, your zoo construction site story kind of blows that whole theory out of the water, Jay. 
[02:57:00]  No, come on.  Serena Williams is my favorite thing in the world.  Goddamn.  I want to fuck Serena Williams so bad.  You do?  Yeah.  You can do it now.  She's a beast.  You're a free man.  It's amazing.  Yeah, are you completely free, or are you settling down with this Nikki girl?  No, we settled in.  What would you do?  Jesus Christ. 
[02:57:30]  Well, she has something to do with it, I was thinking, and all right, she's into it too, huh?  What are you going to do, like, go look for something better?  She's the hottest thing I've ever laid eyes on, and she talks and everything.  They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, and that's wrong.  The way to a man's heart is through his fucking washing machine.  Really?  Oh.  If you find a girl that does laundry, forget it.  Yeah, you've got to love girls that do the laundry.  Laundry never ends. 
[02:58:00]  I've been single four months, and it's like having herpes.  Nikki Cox is doing your laundry?  Alley laundry.  I mean, yeah, doing both of your laundry?  I'm going to be like, yeah, that's right.  Alley, yeah.  Oh, wash my underwear, who what?  She's the best, dude, I'm telling you.  She's really, her looks are like the least of her qualities.  Does she do the wash, like, in her underwear sometimes? 
[02:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  Do the laundry, and you look over, and she's in her underwear.  Isn't that the best?  Wow.  I'm telling you, I've never had a girl that was so hot, I lost my erection.  Wow.  Wow.  Jimmy?  I've seen her.  Like, I remember, I don't remember what she looked like, but I remember when I saw her,  I was like, Jesus, because I remember Goldthray, I was like, I can't believe he hooked up with that beautiful girl.  So I don't remember what she looked like, but I know when I saw her, I was blown away.  She's got to go to Google.  Well, you could have been with anybody, and you would have thought that.  No, that's not true.  You'd be surprised what a few dollars can pick up. 
[02:59:00]  I've made some nice purchases in the last couple of years.  He's a nice guy, I'm sure.  Who?  Bob.  Yeah, I don't know him.  I've met him once.  I don't know the man.  I don't know what he does.  Yeah.  Just tell him you don't want to drink tab, he'll understand.  It must go seven games.  Oh, man.  Hey, Patty really crawled across the studio naked?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  She has come a long way, Jay. 
[02:59:30]  Her new porn name, Patricia Brooks.  The body wasn't that bad, considering.  For a 50-year-old broad.  It really wasn't that bad.  You've got to give it to her.  For an old broad.  For an old broad.  Hey, hell, it's no Nicky Cox, but you know what?  We had to start this whole thing over again, and we're not getting the talent yet, Jay.  So even a stalker patty naked is better than nothing.  Oh, that is a good starting point, because really, you know, you could really improve upon that.  We had that Polish girl in the other day, though. 
[03:00:00]  Do you have any guests coming in today?  Huh?  Do you have any guests coming in today?  No, this is pretty much it.  You're it.  Really?  You're it.  Hey, Ben, don't you think as a producer of the show, it's kind of your job to line up guests?  Dude, we have a professional booker.  She can't even get the job done.  Well, where's Ben?  I want to hear Ben's response to that.  We hear about who was supposed to be on the show, is what we hear.  We were supposed to have...  Who was the big star we were supposed to have the other day?  Vin Diesel.  Vin Diesel was supposed to be on, so that was kind of cool.  He stood us up.  That he didn't show up.  Instead, you got the duck. 
[03:00:30]  Who?  From his Pacifier movie.  From his bad movie.  There you go.  Yeah, I booked the duck from Pacifier.  And we were supposed to have Chris Jericho today, but he overslept.  What?  Is that what we're hearing?  Yeah, there's an excuse every day why these people don't show up.  There is an excuse every day.  Why these people don't show up on our show.  Well, if he overslept, that means he's up now.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  He's not oversleeping.  He overslept.  He'll still be sleeping.  Was that Voss?  No.  Why, did you hear some slurping sound? 
[03:01:00]  You know what's amazing?  What amazed me about Voss after working with him for two years on Last Comic Standing is  for a guy that can't speak, all of his bits end in words he can't say.  Like, I owe her money and I'm dodging her.  So, like, you couldn't say avoiding, which you can say flawlessly.  Next time you have him on, try to get him to say, I eat sushi in church on Tuesday.  And then just get the Gallagher tarp and cover yourself up. 
[03:01:30]  The Gallagher tarp.  There she is.  It's sushi in church on Sunday.  And if he does try to say it, he'll like, he has to pop and swallow first.  Jesus.  Hey, we're looking at pictures of your squeeze.  We popped up a couple of pics on Google.  Look at him, he's doing it in your face.  In your face.  Yeah, that's a...  I'm sorry about it, fucker.  That's very, very nice. 
[03:02:00]  She's the best, dude.  Good job.  Good job, Jay.  You've done good.  You've done good.  She's lovely.  The series must go seven games.  All right.  All right, you bastard.  Hey, get in here, though, one day.  You've got to come and stop in when you're in New York.  Dude, I will do nothing else other than your show.  And I canceled Sirius yesterday because I would never be able to look you in the eye  knowing that I did that bullshit company before I did you.  Thank you, Jay. 
[03:02:30]  Ozzy's going to be there Monday?  Yeah.  I hope so, yeah.  He's supposed to be.  He better be.  Hopefully he won't oversleep or...  All right, Jimmy's going to be like a babbling schoolgirl.  Oh, dude, I'm going to be just an ass.  I have to prepare questions because I'll have nothing to say, like, spur of the moment.  Do you remember that Bugs Bunny with the Sinatra rooster and the Bing Crosby rooster  are, like, competing and all the chickens are just like...  They're swooning, yeah.  They're shooting eggs up their ass.  That's Jimmy.  Yeah, I really will be a blithering idiot. 
[03:03:00]  Jim, what's the number to West Palm Beach if somebody wanted to get tickets to your show?  I honestly don't have it in front of me.  I should, but I don't.  Oh, my God.  No, I don't think about plugs when I'm on this program.  I just think about having fun and doing this.  So it's the West Palm Beach Improv?  Yeah, so tomorrow through Saturday.  So if you went to, like, improv.com, for example.  Like, if I'm online right now, let me just figure out how to route this through.  It might be Improv Comedy Clubs or ImprovClubs.com.  Or you can go to EatABullet.com and link to it from my calendar page. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, that's your website, EatABullet.com?  561-833-1812.  That's the number of your website?  No, that's the number of...  No, you can't call the website.  That's the number of the improv.  Oh, I got confused.  So the West Palm Beach Improv is what?  561-833-1812.  1812.  Yeah.  A lot of big laughs.  Yes, sir.  I miss you, buddy.  I miss you, Jay.  We always have fun.  I miss eating fried raviolis at Joey Paisano. 
[03:04:00]  Hey, we'll go to Paisano on Mulberry Street.  Have some fried raviolis.  Oh, let me tell you a quick Frenchie story, okay?  Why are you called to say fuck you?  And I know you guys probably have to take some kind of break, right?  Not really.  Something.  We can just keep going.  How many times has Frenchie come to my shows for free  and just sat there in the dressing room, like, drooling, going,  yes, you come to my restaurant.  It's very good.  Like, every single time, all he does is ask me to go to his restaurant, right?  Yeah.  Do you have a go?  Yeah. 
[03:04:30]  Hence the stories to follow.  Okay.  So, but I admire your enthusiasm.  Just moving it along, Jay.  So, when my book comes out, I get the publishers in New York and everything,  and I'm going to take them all out to dinner, and I'm like, I know just the place.  So, I get all these people from Hyperion and, like, three of my friends,  and we go to Frenchie's restaurant.  He's like a fucking, he's like Eric Roberts in Popeye's Village waiter.  Like, he's that low on the totem pole, and he always makes it like it's his restaurant. 
[03:05:00]  Like, he's just a bum.  He's not, there's two waiters in there.  He's not even our waiter.  And then at the end of the night, he comes over, and he puts a fucking $300 check in front of me.  And I literally did, like, a pesky, like, you gotta embarrass me, make me look like a schmuck in front of my friends.  He should have clobbered him over the head with a bottle.  Hey, he wanted me to crucify his kid this, but $7,000 I charge.  He gave me a fucking $300 check, and I'm like, what?  Yes, I took off the ice cream. 
[03:05:30]  Like, something was free, and it made it worse.  I've gone there many, many times with many, many people, and I have never, ever gotten a break on the check.  I went in there one time, I got a free dessert.  That's why I never went back.  Yeah.  For what?  Yeah, but he's always, like, talking it up.  Like, he owns it, and come on in, I'll whine you, I'll dine you.  Yeah, you think.  He doesn't fret you.  He's like, hey, if you feel like you come down, and you go down, boom, there's appetizers on your table by the time you're after it's the seat.  Oh, with Joey, you leave with more money than you came in with. 
[03:06:00]  Sunday, he picked up a check for nine of us, Joey.  Yeah, nine of us.  I was just looking for a slight break.  Well, you can do that when you work in construction.  That's right.  In the sanitation business.  Yeah, I hear you.  I never got a break.  I kept going back many times because it was really good food, but, you know, what are you going to do?  Really good food.  French food.  Fags.  West French food.  Hey, Jay, someone from Wagbag, they don't forget anything. 
[03:06:30]  They want to know if you were begging to try to get on Howard's show, because Howard made a whole deal about that.  If I won?  Uh, Howard went off on a whole rant about you, saying that you were trying to beg to be on his show.  No.  He bad-mouthed him in an interview.  Jay bad-mouthed him in an interview.  He bashed him.  Right, and then Howard claimed that you were begging to get on the show.  Well, he was saying, I think...  Hey, I don't beg for nobody.  I think it was...  Oh, wait, I got the clip.  Of Howard?  Yeah.  All right, let's listen.  This is the beauty of the new show, Jay. 
[03:07:00]  We get to play all these clips.  We play whatever we want.  That calls Howard.  I know what did happen is, um...  Hold on.  Sorry, I was going to take my mouth out.  I, um...  I was...  I had phone calls from friends telling me that he was talking about me, and then I clicked  over and listened, and Gary was suggesting me as a guest, and Howard said, no, because  I don't know what I would talk to him about.  And it was, like, really, like, boring, and I turned it.  Well, here it is.  Here's the clip.  Hey, Mitch, you're on the air.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that Jay Moore ripped off one of your bits on Jimmy 
[03:07:30]  Kimmel last night.  Jesus.  What did he do?  Uh, he was actually breathing while he was telling one of his jokes.  Oh, very funny.  Very funny.  The guy bashed him.  Nailed him.  He walked right into it.  Yeah, the guy...  Howard's all happy, thinking he's got one of these, uh, stupid, ripped-me-off things  again.  He was actually breathing.  Did you hear that, Jay?  I invented that, Robin.  That's awesome.  Let me tell you about Marconi, Robin.  Yeah, you do great, Howard.  It makes me happy when you do that.  Thank you, Jay Moore. 
[03:08:00]  It continues, listen.  Telling one of his jokes.  Kind of like you do.  I think you invented that.  Hey, Jay, why don't you stop calling the show?  You're not coming on ever.  Also, at this point, Howard thinks...  Oh, yeah, I did do this.  I was like, is this kind of delusional thing?  I call it myself.  Of course.  I forgot to...  Yeah.  Howard thinks he's talking to Jay Moore.  That's what makes this so beautiful.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, now we've got to start over.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, because the guy sounds so much like me.  What a lunatic.  Hey, uh, Mitch, you're on the air. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, I just want to let you know that, uh, Jay Moore ripped off one of your bits on Jimmy  Kimmel last night.  What did he do?  Uh, he was actually breathing while he was telling one of his jokes.  Kind of like you do.  I think you invented that.  Yeah, boy.  Hey, Jay, why don't you stop calling the show?  You're not coming on ever.  Oh, my God.  I think he'd have more to do.  Yeah.  Do you think he's serious?  Isn't Jay the comic who tried for years to get on our show and then trashed me on the  Opian Antti show?  Absolutely.  Yeah, well, F him. 
[03:09:00]  He stood on the side of the MTV Awards.  Yeah.  He stood there.  Not unlike Jim Carrey ten years earlier.  You know, just waiting to get on the show.  Yeah, so Jim got on and Jay didn't.  Right.  And so, uh...  Oh, you know, I'm a loser like Jim Carrey.  Remember when we did Jim Carrey boss?  You're a loser like the guy that makes 20 mil a picture.  You know, I can't take it anymore.  Like, every once in a while, I like the show, but I just can't take... 
[03:09:30]  I mean, I know they all get paid to agree with him, but it gets to a point where it's  just awful.  Yeah, how about once in a while, just not agreeing with the guy?  We were saying that earlier, man.  There's a black show on a work robin.  I know.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  You think he'd have better things to do than call a show?  He does, because that isn't him.  Jesus Christ.  Let me hear it again.  That guy sounds nothing like me.  He sounds like one of my uncles.  That continues.  And so, you know, boo-hoo. 
[03:10:00]  Boo-hoo.  So, after being a super fan, he trashes me, because he's got no goddamn convictions or morality  or anything.  You hurt his feelings.  Yeah, I hurt his feelings, because he's such a scary talent.  Now he's doing star search.  Well, I'm a sneaky cop, you babe.  God damn.  He's right about the morality, though.  Yeah, you don't have any morality, that's for sure, but Jesus.  You're having a good time, though. 
[03:10:30]  Wow.  What a tool.  It continues.  Now he's doing star search.  Great.  Good luck.  By the way, I have to take back what I said about that show.  I watched the rest of it.  It was abominable.  All right.  Boy, New York comedians were really bad.  Really?  Oh, my goodness.  How good is a comedian going to be on television where you're not allowed to say anything?  I mean, seriously, think about it.  Well, they did do some bleeping, but, man. 
[03:11:00]  And bleeping always makes everything funny.  Well, it made Ozzy funny, so I guess the comedians thought it would help them.  He's very grumpy and tired.  Oh, always.  Always.  He's just calling it in at this point.  Sirius has no idea how bad that deal really is.  They have no clue yet.  His half a billion dollar deal.  Jesus.  I don't understand how they're going to make that work.  That's some serious cash.  Man, you've got to give him that.  You're making some real money.  Yes.  Yes, sir. 
[03:11:30]  Yes, sir.  Yes, Jay.  Did he get us?  Are you getting me?  I think he got us.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was the reverse silent game.  Yes.  Opie, no more, I don't know, no more Shandy?  No, we're done, too.  All right.  Yeah, Jay, well, dude, you got Nikki.  Well, honestly, I don't even care.  I mean, yeah, it's over.  It's over.  It seemed like it was a tough time off for everybody, it seems like. 
[03:12:00]  She broke up with me five weeks after we got canceled.  That was probably the first time you ever had to talk to each other.  No shit.  I lost my career and my chick all within like a month, month and a half, yeah.  We were coming home.  I mean, I knew we had problems.  We were coming home from Montreal, and I looked over at her, and I go, wow, you're just not  into this anymore.  She goes, yeah, you're right.  Wow, really?  Was that how it happened?  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah.  Ouch.  Is she seeing anybody now? 
[03:12:30]  I don't know.  I don't really care.  I don't care about that.  I wasn't paying for me.  What?  What?  I've been having a fine time since, so I don't really care.  Nice.  And then Dice, his whole thing broke up, and then Barry Williams, his marriage broke up.  Dice and Barry Williams were going out?  I don't know that.  Barry, the Barry Williams one, I'm scared to call him another friend of the show, but  that thing sounds a little too strange to get into, because I knew the Williams pretty 
[03:13:00]  well from, you know, hanging out in L.A.  I've hung with them a bunch of times, and then when they came to New York, they seem  like a very, very happy couple, and then it makes the tabloids that they're getting  a divorce, and that she wants full custody, and she only wants a nanny around when Barry  sees his own son.  Yeah.  So I'm thinking, wow, something really bad had to happen there.  Yeah, because the son's 16.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Well done, Paul.  Thank you.  So we haven't gotten to the bottom of that one. 
[03:13:30]  I don't know if we ever will, but...  Well, you should just have all your friends that are getting divorced on the show.  Well, no, I mean, it's unbelievable, you know?  You, Barry, Dice.  But you know what makes up for it all?  Voss is getting married.  Me, right?  My relationship broke up.  Ben's.  Yeah, Ben's did.  Ben's did.  Steve's Will.  Steve.  He just doesn't know it yet.  How many more teams?  Black girl and his dungeon master.  My girl. 
[03:14:00]  Earl.  I haven't had a relationship.  Well, you're a smart man, I guess.  I settle down with a different girl every night.  Yeah.  Don't pay any more religious taxes.  Yeah, but it sounds much nicer than Italian.  Yeah, you know what?  I had a...  One dog looking one way, one looking the other guy in the middle saying,  what do you want from me?  Hey, I'm going to say something.  Don't eat.  Jay, I had a really weird two years, I got to tell you, man.  It was weird.  Well, tell us now.  Well, I've brought up most of them.  It started with... 
[03:14:30]  Before we got fired, like a month before we got fired,  my grandma died, who was like a mother figure to me, okay?  So she dies.  That's not funny?  No, I know.  Then I lose the career.  Then I lost the long-term chick.  Then my best friend moves to L.A.  Then my uncle drops.  And then I lost my dad four days after we signed this contract.  Like just one after another.  My whole life got completely turned upside down. 
[03:15:00]  The listeners are home on their soundboards hitting the laugh thing.  To get back at you.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  All right.  I can do it to myself, you know.  There you go.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I must say I like that laugh, but I do kind of miss the Cape Fear one.  And the short car crash is infinitely better than the long car crash.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Yep.  So I'm looking at it.  Which one's the short car crash? 
[03:15:30]  That's this one.  I agree.  That's by far.  What's the long one?  We had one a while ago.  The old one from the old show that just went on and on.  Oh, I like this one.  Big wreck.  Yeah, this one's great because there's that airbag top.  Yeah, you do hear that.  Oh, my God.  We're looking at Nikki Cox's pictures from FHM.  Jesus.  Wow.  She's all right.  Good God.  She's all right.  Good God, man.  She's all right.  That's a nice little top she's got on.  Is that in the laundry pile?  These guys are the best.  And it'll be like during like an awful patch of the show. 
[03:16:00]  I'm like, no, seriously, they really are.  Yeah, there's a few of those.  Uncle Tom, he's got a dobo in her mouth.  No, no, seriously, they're really funny.  When they're not doing that, they're pretty clever, pretty entertaining.  Look at us all just catching up.  It's been way too long, Jay.  It certainly has.  Oh, Bobby.  Bobby.  So.  All right, Jim, West Palm Improv this weekend, right?  I will be there Thursday through Saturday, and I'm telling you, I just, I'm really going  to have some good jokes for the crowd.  There you go.  What kind of material do you do?  That's always my favorite question. 
[03:16:30]  Where do you get your ideas?  Well, why don't you bring it up?  I don't have a joke for that, but I'll put someone else up for it.  Well, Norton will be in West Palm.  Jay Moore will be in Nikki Cox.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Lord, are you the one that hates when people type?  Am I remembering correctly when you say laugh out loud?  L-O-L.  L-O-L.  Yeah, drives me nuts.  It makes me, I don't know if you've said all this before, so if you have, stop me, but 
[03:17:00]  when people type that, I want to fucking smash my keyboard.  Like, I'm really supposed to believe that you're typing and laughing maniacally every  fifth sentence.  Worse than that is the image of someone rolling on the floor laughing.  I only want to see that if their fucking apartment is on fire and they're trying to survive.  Or L-M-A-O laughing my ass off.  Yuck.  Maybe you can give me some free tickets, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll come by tomorrow, L-O-L.  It's like, what the fuck is funny about that? 
[03:17:30]  I'll come by tomorrow.  Ha, ha, ha.  No, I won't.  Yeah, it's awful.  Just kidding.  Wink.  Send me a call in in the fucking smaller than size.  It makes me sick.  J-K.  J-K.  What's that?  That's just kidding.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Well, you type, and then you have to type back G-A.  That's the response.  And what was that?  Get AIDS.  A big bucket of AIDS, like chum.  All right, Jake.  What's Connor up to these days, Jim? 
[03:18:00]  Who's that?  Connor.  Little Connor?  Yeah.  Oh, you were listening to all that, too, huh?  What a hit that was.  It was the T-shirt that said, Dad's little chum.  Dad's little chum.  Oh, that's awful.  Yeah, we went through quite the phase.  And the Ramon promos is probably the lowest you guys have ever gotten.  Ramon.  I love that one.  From the listeners.  Oh, I know.  That was bad.  With that, like, God of Thunder synthesizer voice.  Just awful, cheesy voice that was on there really bad. 
[03:18:30]  Another day outside under the blue sky.  Ramon, give me your thumb.  Like, it didn't even make sense.  It didn't make sense.  That was awful.  You guys, who answered the phone, Eric?  Danny.  Danny.  We pretty much have a whole new crew that works for us, too.  Danny?  Danny? 
[03:19:00]  I've got you on my lawn.  No answering the phones.  That's the important thing.  Well, the world needs teach-tickers.  We got rid of a bunch of people and brought in some new blood there, Jay.  All right.  Well, tell them I'm in the hood now.  I'm calling.  All right.  Yeah, we moved Steve up, and we moved Ben up.  Stinky's working somewhere else, doing very well.  And there you have it.  And Rick Delgado's in the unemployment line humming the tsunami song.  What an idiot.  Yeah.  A tree right through her head. 
[03:19:30]  Jay, we're on satellite radio, and we're paranoid every day.  That guy, the first chance he got, went right for the thing that would get you fired.  Screaming chinks.  Hello.  And he lived...  I loved it in the press release when it listed all the people's names that got laid off and  fined.  It was like Lady Diva X.  Yeah.  And, uh...  I guess he was on, like, a Hot 97-type program.  Yeah, a hip-hop station.  Todd Lynn got in big trouble for that, too.  He lost everything, man.  He had a deal with ABC or some network.  He lost. 
[03:20:00]  Todd lost...  Who?  You know Todd Lynn, Black Comic?  No.  He was on 97, but that tsunami song.  He was the guy that said, I'm going to go shoot Asians.  Great.  Yeah, yeah.  He lost everything.  And the Greaseman's back, right?  Is he?  Really?  Yeah, he's doing something similar.  Oh, he's terrific.  Is he on commercial radio or is he still just buying time?  Because I know he buys time.  Like, he goes to a radio station and goes, I need about two hours of programming time for  the Greaseman show.  And then he pays for it. 
[03:20:30]  And then he goes out to businesses and sells airtime, sells his own time to try to recoup  the money.  So you go out to the local chicken place, or, you know, you buy your fried chicken, go down  there and get a wingie.  And there he is hawking goods to try to pay for the airtime that he bought.  So it's like an infomercial, but it's his show that he puts commercials on.  That's brilliant, actually.  It really is clever.  I'm an even genius here.  Not bad.  At least he's back. 
[03:21:00]  Yes, Jay.  He got us good.  That was a good one.  Hey, guys, listen.  And we listened.  That was a good one.  You got to give it to him.  That was a very, very funny phone call.  Jay was on fire today, man.  That was good.  Fucking Chris Penn and Keitel.  Very funny.  Perfect.  Is that...  Well, slowly but surely getting the band back together.  Yeah.  Very funny.  I said some bad things about Jay, but, you know...  Well, you love Jay, man.  You were just...  You were hurt because you didn't call in.  No. 
[03:21:30]  Like, why did the guy kind of abandon the show?  You were hurt.  It wasn't even...  You don't like Jay.  Definitely pissed off that we didn't get him on sooner.  That's all.  Same with Dice.  I mean, what the fuck?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  People say things they lash out when they're wounded or hurt.  That's all it is.  It's like a relationship.  Say things you later want to take back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jay, if you're still listening, I'm sorry.  Aw.  You wounded me.  Jay was very nice to me when I was in L.A. and doing Last Comic Standing and in New York.  All right.  Cool.  He was very good.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  Actually, New York, not L.A.  Vegas and New York.  For the people that are still listening to the program. 
[03:22:00]  Actually, that type of radio is the best right there.  J.K., J.K., J.K.  G.A.  G.A.  Oh, J.K., I meant Jewkiller.  I'm not a racist.  Can't do a little racist humor?  Yes, you can.  Of course I can.  What time is our meeting with Shemp Hair?  Oh, Eric Logan?  I think he's wandering around already.  He's wandering around already.  Did you see him?  No.  Is he in our office?  Where are we having this meeting?  I don't know. 
[03:22:30]  Is it going to be in here in our studio?  Probably at Supercuts.  Wow, who's that?  The lemon tree.  What is that?  Ben.  No.  You idiot.  No, that's the guy who Jim talked to earlier on the phone?  Yeah.  Oh, gotcha.  Okay.  No details.  Just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Wow, really?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  He's telling you about the book deal?  Yeah.  Wow, Jim wants to rip your throat out right now.  Sometimes I want to rip his throat out, too. 
[03:23:00]  He's an instigator.  Ooh.  I'm going to sit back and watch this.  I love Jim.  Let's just kick your feet up.  I'm going to put my feet up on the console.  That's Jerry, the sales guy.  I can't humor everyone for saying it.  Mm-hmm.  He's here to talk to us about sales stuff.  What?  Really?  Dude, we've got to go home.  We've got meetings all day today.  We've got Eric, then you guys have got to record stuff, then there's a sales meeting.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  Yeah.  Meeting with the Rams.  I hope it can be done through my telephone on my OnStar. 
[03:23:30]  I'll hit the button.  I'll go, call, studio, and then we can have our meeting as I'm driving down the LIA.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  You all right, Jim?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay.  Jim's back.  What the?  What the?  Just a little temporary lapse of reason.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Jim's back.  Everything's fine.  Go ahead, turn the mics off and go into spots.  I want to see this.  Can we go back live if action happens?  Of course not.  No?  God damn it.  This place has to be wired differently. 
[03:24:00]  Anyway, don't forget tomorrow we're broadcast live from the Hard Rock Cafe.  Yes.  Here in New York City.  That's on 57th Street between 7th and Broadway.  And it should be a lot of fun broadcasting from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.  Kegs and eggs.  And it's going to be fun.  First up.  St. Paddy's Day.  Kind of our first live broadcast, especially in the New York area.  What the?  Who?  What?  Right?  First.  What?  When?  First live broadcast since coming to XM.  No?  We did it live at the goddamn, in Vegas.  I said New York.  Did a live.  Oh, if New York.  This is our backyard.  We did say New York. 
[03:24:30]  What the?  I'm hoping that we get a nice turnout.  By the way, I.  It would be nice to see some old faces and some new faces.  Bit of good news.  Friday morning, marketing is coming up to put up some posters for it.  Oh, yeah.  Good, good.  For Friday, they're coming in for us.  Yeah, Ben, is that true?  Or was that one of your rumors?  I mean, what?  What are you talking about?  That marketing didn't know we were doing, uh...  I don't know.  I'm not going to comment on that.  Why not?  There's nothing wrong.  It's not my place to comment on that.  Ben's not commenting.  All right.  I was just asking.  He comments in the office.  Oh, yeah.  Where Ben has his comments.  He has lots of comments in the office. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, but that's in the office.  In the office.  In the office.  Believe me, a lot of things are said in the office that are not meant for the air.  Just like I'm sure Steve was having an hour's worth of my conversations.  Steve, I was just joking.  It's radio.  We do jokes here.  I know you're in a loving relationship.  All right.  See, that stuff is being discussed.  Yeah, that was just a joke.  All the interns have to do is write a book about what's said in that office and we're all done.  Anthony is the biggest racist I've ever seen in my life. 
[03:25:30]  Ever, ever, ever.  Notice Nathaniel always has his pad, too.  Yeah, taking notes.  Here's mine.  And here's mine.  If you think Opie's an asshole on the air, you should hear how he acts off air.  Is this guy ever happy?  Bossing around the staff?  Not just a show bitch.  In crappy mood when he comes in without food yet? 
[03:26:00]  Oh.  Well, that's my problem.  Opie semi-colon bully.  Bully.  What the fuck is this that you wrote?  Oh, they could say some stuff about Jimmy, too.  Oh, sure they could.  I'm garbage.  I have not seen one racial group left unscathed by Anthony's hate.  I'll bet you the interns of all of us have the least amount of dirt on me, because I'm  here the least amount of time.  That is true.  And you're pretty much what you see is what you get on the air, off the air. 
[03:26:30]  That's right.  I'm trash with feet.  Right.  Does Opie really believe he's better than all of us?  Oh, boy.  Opie, the nerve.  He does realize he's a hack, doesn't he?  God knows.  They probably bring in tape recorders.  Right.  Oh.  And you know half the things that are said on this show, they're in the back going, what 
[03:27:00]  kind of dog shit is that?  I'm funnier than that.  I know I do.  Yeah, that, too.  Yeah.  How did he get hired?  Why is he sitting there?  I'm a comic.  I think he should be there.  He's a comic, too.  Right.  Sure.  Nathaniel is very funny.  He comes up with some very funny lines in the office.  He has a dry wit, which is very enjoyable.  Yeah.  I enjoy a dry wit, so.  Yeah.  All right.  We should take a break.  Are we going to have a good broadcast tomorrow?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, now it's going to stink.  It's going to stink?  All right.  Don't show up tomorrow.  Of course it's going to be good. 
[03:27:30]  Well, I have to leave towards the end of it, because I have to catch a plane.  Jet setting.  Hey, you.  Stop.  How many breaks do we have to take?  Four?  No, we'll take one long one here.  One long one, and then we'll come back, play, what did we learn, and, I don't know, wrap up.  One long one.  How long is it going to be?  It's not that long.  It's three minutes.  That's a long break.  Play, what did we learn for 20 minutes?  It was nice that Jay called in today.  It was great hearing from Jay.  Yes, it was hilarious.  You forget how funny he is on the phone and stuff.  It was good to catch up, and I hope you enjoyed that. 
[03:28:00]  It was just kind of listening in on a phone call, really.  Not even a radio phone call, just a bunch of guys getting to know themselves again.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  People pointing out that I'm on the air talking about sympathizing with Hitler and browsing  white power websites, yet some of the things I do off the air put that to shame, that I  can't speak about it on the air.  Well, because we know when you're saying it in the office, you really mean it.  Oh, stop.  There's not a lot of laughs when I walk in the office and you're pointing at those black  murder statistics going, 85%. 
[03:28:30]  That actually is true.  At least I back it up with facts.  You did say something about something hanging from a light post this morning.  Where did I say that?  Did I really?  When you were stuck in traffic.  I did not.  You left that out of the on-air version of your little story.  Wait, wait, I'm trying to remember.  Wait, I was stuck in traffic.  Oh, the people directing traffic.  You know, if we're going to lay it on the line here.  Hey, I said nothing about race. 
[03:29:00]  That's true.  All I said was that the people that do the traffic at the intersections, that wear the  orange vest and wave you on and stop you, they'd be more effective if they were hanging  from the light post on the corner.  Explain that.  Explain it?  Yeah.  Well, they do no good work standing there in the intersection.  They usually screw up traffic more than do it, so I believe them hanging there would be  less of a deterrent.  All I know is, as a white male in a white society, I would never find myself wanting 
[03:29:30]  to hang from anything.  Yeah.  Well, no, just because there are traffic agents in the middle of the road doesn't mean they're  of any race.  I've seen them of all races.  Half-white, black, Asian.  Where?  Where have you seen the white and Asian ones?  I'd love to know what corner that's on.  Right.  See, the on-air version of his little story was a little different than the office version.  There's a white traffic, one of the traffic guys is white.  I believe he's in Bensonhurst.  The one Asian is on Hester Street in Chinatown. 
[03:30:00]  Those are the ones I could have been referring to.  You're right.  That's all?  Mm-hmm.  What?  Mm-hmm.  I just see Nathaniel and Danny, too.  They sit there and just shake their heads and kind of go, oh, like, oh, this is going  to make a great book.  It's going to expose them.  Yeah, do these guys sign anything?  Sign their life away, basically.  Oh, good.  Confidentiality agreements.  Yeah.  What's the name of Danny's book?  Celebrities I've Blown Off Like an Idiot?  Danny got really upset by that. 
[03:30:30]  What?  Not by you.  No, no, by Jay.  I just tell Danny that maybe he can stand at the door on Monday when Ozzy comes in and  check his license, and if it doesn't look like him, this is John Osborne.  This isn't you.  Just so you know, Jimmy, when Jay called in, when he called in that, I know, he didn't  call the hotline number.  He called the regular call line, so there's no way to know anybody could call those numbers.  So if he called the hotline, it would have helped out a little bit.  I want everyone to make Danny's life a living hell, so starting tomorrow, calling in as  a celebrity.  You're all celebrities tomorrow. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, you got him really good.  LOL.  All right, we should take a break.  All right.  Is Eric here yet for our big meeting?  I haven't seen him, but there's other people here to meet with us.  We freaked him out so much that he decided to come up from Washington to calm us down.  Where is he?  So all those idiots on the New York Radio Message Board and all our critics on all these  other radio websites, shut the fuck up.  People are trying to think that, trying to say that we've been a complete failure for 
[03:31:30]  XM.  Who's, no one says that.  It's completely the opposite.  Complete is such a strong word.  Yeah, we're partial failures for Pete's sakes.  Take your facts straight.  We're moderate failures.  Come on.  Complete.  That means completely.  Yeah.  Everyone's speculating because we're coming off the premium and all that.  Will you shut up?  What it means.  You want to see failures?  You tell those 1,400 people that are signed up for premium service.  You tell those 1,400 people.  You know, it's great.  If you look at it, we were on the premium. 
[03:32:00]  We're coming off the premium April 2nd.  People speculate that that means failure for some reason.  If we were free to start, and then they put us on a premium later on, they would say we  have failed because now what XM needs to do is have people pay extra for us because  not enough people were subscribing.  So in both situations, we would be called a failure.  Here it is logically.  Yeah.  When we went, when we started with XM, they had this idea for a premium service.  They thought this was the next thing with satellite radio.  Yeah.  To have like... 
[03:32:30]  They had good intentions.  But the problem is, they just spent the last six months trying to find anything else that  would be interesting enough to put on a premium channel, and they just couldn't find it.  There's really not that much talent out there.  The Playboy channel has been pretty much a failure for the company.  Oh, Jesus.  Complete?  Yeah.  Well, it wasn't good.  We killed them in numbers.  Killed them.  It's supposed to talk them up, though, because they're not coming over with us to the basic  service.  So it's still going to be subscriber-based.  So perhaps you should say, ah, some people really enjoy the Playboy thing. 
[03:33:00]  Maybe it's a small audience, but very loyal.  They actually do.  Well, you know what?  I've never heard...  Well, I've heard the Playboy channel a couple times, and I have enjoyed it.  I'm not a regular listener, and maybe it's good.  I don't know.  Sure.  But as far as a business thing goes, they were hoping it was going to do better than it  did.  A little better than it did.  And then they got us, and then they were hoping to create more programming that people  would pay extra for, and they just couldn't find it.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  And they knew that we would be better off for the company if we were exposed to the entire  XM Nation. 
[03:33:30]  How is that us being failures?  Just a quick question.  If someone is paying for you, and you got like X amount of dollars a month for the show,  and you're failing, why would they take you off and lose that revenue?  Yeah.  It doesn't make sense.  Right.  Why take you off the premium channel when they were at least making money with you on it  if it doesn't make financial sense?  They have to speculate.  They have to speculate.  It's their life.  They love the speculation.  Hey, Bruce Kelly.  How are you? 
[03:34:00]  Hey.  Hi, Bruce.  What's up, man?  We probably shouldn't have said hi to you because we're an hour late from breaking.  That's okay.  Great to be here in New York in the cacophony of cacophony of kookiness.  Oh, we did that on this show today?  Yeah, this show is the longest show we've done.  Cacophony.  Yeah, so since I am the new vice president of chief financial officer,  I appreciate your analysis of the cost per effective Playboy channel.  But why don't you break it down into a spreadsheet?  And I'm sure, Anthony, you've seen the spreadsheet and everything. 
[03:34:30]  We were talking about this the other night.  I write them up.  That the cost per point and the churn rate actually on the Playboy channel is one of the lowest on our content platform.  Very loyal listeners.  And Jesus Christ, somebody stop me right now because this sounds like a VP meeting.  Well, that's good.  That's why I came up to New York.  Is that what we're going to do?  To get away from that.  You should be amazing.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Tell everyone why you're here.  Okay, well, first of all, to get the hell out of the D.C. building for a couple of days.  That's the beauty of this. 
[03:35:00]  Everyone in D.C. is just as miserable as we are.  They just want to get out of there.  They just don't vocalize it because they have to work in the building every day.  We're so far away, we can say whatever we want.  It's ELO.  It's ELO.  ELO's here.  ELO's in the building.  ELO.  See, there's the problem.  He just got back from super cuts, too.  Where is it?  Jesus.  He's in our office.  He's got his Kevin Costner Roman Emperor haircut.  All hail ELO.  Look, guys, I can run a bunch of bullshit by you.  Then I'm up here and we're going to do something for free to air.  By the way, congratulations. 
[03:35:30]  You're finally getting where you need to be.  Yes.  April 2nd.  But I tell you what, I'm up here to audition.  Oh.  Okay?  Get me the fuck out of the 80s channel.  You want to get out of there?  Please, God.  I dig the 80s channel.  Yeah, that's okay.  That's all right.  But you know what?  I'm 48 years old.  I'm an adult.  I'm tired of this crap.  I'm going to have a little fun.  Please.  Yeah.  Please, I'm begging you.  I'm begging you.  We're going to lose Jim to HBO.  Jim's going to make that announcement in about a week.  Really?  Yeah.  Then at that point, here comes the speculation. 
[03:36:00]  I think at that point, we'll be looking for somebody new to sit in that seat.  All right.  Evil producer here is saying break.  Oh.  All right, Ben.  All right.  But basically, Bruce Kelly's here.  He's going to interview Ant and I and Ben and Jim and a bunch of us.  Yeah.  And it's going to be interspliced during our worst ofs when we're on vacation.  Yeah, that starts April 2nd.  Just to spice it up a little bit.  When is that happening?  Right after the show.  Right after the show.  This is going to be another doomsday ride home for me.  You know what I would do right now?  Yeah.  Call the chick.  Get a room. 
[03:36:30]  Get a room at the park.  We actually have a room.  For tonight?  Yeah.  So then stay.  I'm not going to say where.  Why are you going home?  It's not at the park, by the way.  They were all booked.  Oh, I know where it is.  I have to go home because we don't want to have two cars in the seat.  I've got a suite at the W, so if you want to knock out a couple of hours.  Do you really?  Dude, I'm sure the Four Seasons will give you a break on two cars when you park.  Yeah, I'm staying at the Four Seasons.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  Hoo-hoo, Anthony.  Wellington.  Let's do it!  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[03:37:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  All right.  Wrapping up another O&A show.  Yeah.  Once again, we got nothing accomplished, but it was a lot of fun trying. 
[03:37:30]  Do we ever really get anything accomplished?  Sometimes.  Is there a mission that by the end of the show we go, wow, we accomplished that mission?  Please get me out of D.C.  I think if we continue.  Please, Jesus, help me, please.  Get me away from these vice presidents down there.  They are a bunch of...  Hey, Eric.  Eric Logan.  I think our mission is to talk for four hours with a minimal gap of silence between any words.  Absolutely.  And then mission accomplished.  I disagree with you, because sometimes those longer pauses are very effective. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, but that's part of the show.  If you need a dramatic pause, that's part of the show.  I mean, any pauses that aren't supposed to be there.  Okay.  Okay.  And if you can do that four hours, eh, we did a show.  Look who's here.  It's our pal Elo.  What's going on, guys?  How you doing?  I'm doing great.  Nice long hour and a half commute from LaGuardia this morning.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, traffic.  Oh, wait a minute.  You flew from...  I flew from D.C. this morning to here, landed at 8.30, got into a car to get downtown. 
[03:38:30]  It took you longer in a car.  It took me longer in a car from the airport to here than it did to fly from D.C. to here,  which is just...  Welcome to New York.  I love it.  They don't make you take the train?  What's that?  You don't have to take the train?  I could have tucked in the train, but I elected to stay home this morning.  Tell the truth.  Tell the truth.  He was held up in security with the stupid cufflinks.  The cufflinks, yeah.  I would have took in the train.  Yeah.  You know what?  I just don't dig the trains three hours.  I have ADD.  I can't.  I just forget about it.  That's true.  They do have beers, though. 
[03:39:00]  That's true.  So you could sit, but the plane's got that, too.  The plane's got beer.  They don't serve alcohol fast enough on a 30-minute flight.  I know.  You're really going, come on.  Get the cart down here.  Well, you know, you can't get up.  That's the other thing.  If you're flying out of D.C. or into D.C., you can't, like, walk around for 30 minutes.  It's part of this new thing.  Yeah.  If you're in, like, D.C. airspace, you can't leave your seat.  You can't leave your seat 30 minutes prior to landing in 30 minutes.  It's only a 30-minute flight.  Yeah.  It's a 30-minute flight.  So you can't get out of your seat at all.  Wow.  So I'm pounding coffees the whole time.  You know, I've got to pee.  And I get onto the plane, and, of course, everybody's peeing. 
[03:39:30]  I'm like, I'll just wait until it takes off.  They go, well, you can't get up.  So you're sitting there.  It's just, you know.  That'll really ward a terrorist.  Yeah, sitting there going, the rules say I can't get up.  This ruins my whole thing.  I'm supposed to rush to the cockpit.  I'm not allowed to stand up.  I can't pee.  Put them in line at the urinal.  Yeah, rushing to the cockpit with a full bladder just is not a good thing.  It's just a horrible thing.  So now I'm up here hanging, doing the thing, spending some time with the guys.  We're going to have a little meet.  Short meeting.  Short meeting.  Short meeting.  Short meeting.  Only three hours long.  Only two and a half. 
[03:40:00]  Yes, baby.  I've got to tell you, these guys have been trashing you really hard when we're not on the air.  Who?  I've been with you.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Why don't you tell them, man?  You know, you have no problem telling them in the office.  I thought Jimmy actually calls me sweet.  I never trashed Eric.  Ever.  No, you...  So it's the only one that's trashed me.  You know what's great?  And I'll dispel that right now.  You know how disinterested I am with any corporate affairs?  I don't have enough time to diss you.  That's probably true.  I don't even have an interest in any of these people to really bash them off the air.  Off the air.  Why waste the space, the brain matter? 
[03:40:30]  Why waste my office time that I could well be spending with racist remarks by talking  about something like the company?  But Jimmy calls me over the weekend, tells me about the HBO opportunity, and I say it's  the...  He was great.  It's a fantastic...  Why wouldn't you do that?  It's a bummer that we're going to lose him, but we wish him the best.  Yeah, you're going to...  We're going to lose you forever, right?  Yeah, probably starting somewhere around 2011.  Jim Norton will not get that picture.  So between now and then, slave labor is still an option, right? 
[03:41:00]  Okay, good.  Good.  Now, but I'm here to discuss all issues.  All issues?  Well, I mean, I'll discuss all.  Let's start with probably the most important issue.  Did you see the vent over my seat in the office?  No, I haven't.  It has a newspaper stuffed in it, and it needs a user grill, because the air blows right  on me.  Well, if it makes you feel any better, I just went in there and lost my mind, everybody in  there.  I'm trying to find a computer, just so I can find an email, and if I can't find a computer,  it's just like, Jesus Christ. 
[03:41:30]  There's plenty of computers in there, but none you can use.  Yeah, that's what I realized.  There's a video game computer, and we've got an audio over here, so, but...  Don't use mine.  The official .0 computer.  You need some important XM corporate email you've got to send out.  I have to play poker.  You have to play poker, yes.  You know, we'd have our priorities here.  That's absolutely right.  I know.  So, we'll get that handled, so...  Get me away from this guy.  I'm the bearer of good news.  What is he doing here, sir?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  Why is he here?  He's here, because we wanted to end the show with a Wang Chung song. 
[03:42:00]  He could intro it or something.  Skrittly Plutty or something, you know?  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  So, yeah, we'll get into our meeting, and then tomorrow morning, it'll all is right in  the world.  Do you strategically wear shirts like that?  To screw with people's eyes?  Oh, my God.  If you look at it long enough, you all of a sudden go cross-eyed.  I agree with you, Elo.  I got some big, high-powered meetings today, guys.  I had to put the power tie on.  I had to put the suit on.  Elo is right.  What's your way?  Oh, hell, Elo.  He's trying to get someone to sign a contract today. 
[03:42:30]  That's what he's...  I'll give you guys the dirt on his wardrobe.  My eyes are dizzy.  What?  Yeah.  I'll give you guys the dirt, excuse me, dirt on his wardrobe when he comes in.  It's not a bad wardrobe.  It's a nice tie.  It's a very short tie.  You know, he wore a pink tie and a green shirt the other day.  I like that.  Did he really?  Yeah.  It's spring.  It's spring.  It's a young executive look.  Yeah, it's spring.  You know, I just had a birthday recently, so, you know, we've got to do that, right?  It's spring.  How old are you?  29 again?  29.  Oh!  That's so funny.  That's the new Opie and Anthony vibe.  Come April 2nd.  No more of that mean stuff. 
[03:43:00]  Oh, cut it out.  You don't look a day over 50.  Get out of here, you elbow to the ribs.  The safer, tamer, more sensitive Opie and Anthony.  Absolutely.  That's no BS.  Right.  Opening it up to a lot more people, so we want to bring more people in as friends and not chase them away.  The corporate word is mass appeal.  Mass appeal.  So no more ass-fucking?  Oh, Jesus.  You won't hear that come April 2nd.  You know what's amazing when that happens?  It's like the oxygen in my lungs, like, contracts, you know? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, it's kind of...  You can get over it, though, after a while.  Believe me.  But you don't know if it's real or not.  It's like listening to a clip of a violence.  It's just you're just listening to a clip.  But if you're watching it, that's one thing.  But to listen to it...  You have no idea what it is.  Yeah.  It's silly.  That's true.  I mean, I think it was a guy actually having anal sex with a fat chick and then stick it in her mouth.  I mean, that's just what my interpretation of that work was.  You're just guessing?  Yeah.  But you have no way of knowing.  Eh, it's silly.  It's, you know, it's a lot of...  All right, we've got to end this mess.  We're going to be live tomorrow from the Hard Rock Cafe.  Yes.  Elo could have taken a phone call and had the people go, 
[03:44:00]  I can't hear you.  Right, right.  See you tomorrow.  Bye.  7 a.m. to 11 a.m.  I'm out of here.  I'm out of here.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
