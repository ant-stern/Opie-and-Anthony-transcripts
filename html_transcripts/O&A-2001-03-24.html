<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of disgustingly filthy public restrooms, particularly those on the Long Island Railroad, with Opie recounting a particularly graphic story involving a couple engaging in sexual activity resulting in fecal matter. Anthony shared his road rage encounters with aggressive FedEx drivers. Listener calls echoed these experiences.  This segment also included a call from “Mr. Movie Phones,” who revealed selling his company to AOL for $480 million, and a bizarre Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen song featuring repeated use of phrases like "ants in my pants" and "bugs on my bologna," becoming a recurring joke.  Cowbell Bill was a studio guest, briefly mentioned for a story involving an 80-year-old's genitals, and a Frank Caliendo Brian Regan impression was played.  A "best ass" contest was also briefly discussed.

Comedian Brian Regan then joined the show in studio.  The conversation started with a listener's compliment on his performance, quickly shifting to a debate on politically correct terms for people of short stature, with a caller clarifying the difference between "dwarf" and "midget."  The "Best Ass Contest" was revisited, with Regan and the hosts examining contestant photos. A woman with a child who has dwarfism called in, offering perspective.  Regan shared anecdotes, including an emergency room visit. A prank call impersonating Regan, and a brief call from Frank Caliendo impersonating Al Pacino (cut short by technical difficulties), punctuated the segment. Paula Jones' Penthouse appearance was mentioned, followed by a call from someone impersonating her.  The segment concluded with listeners suggesting children's birthday party games, leading to ludicrously dangerous ideas.

Paula Jones herself then appeared as a guest.  The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive banter with her, focusing on her recent photoshoot and physique, making comments about her age, plastic surgery, and dating life.  The interview was frequently interrupted by vulgar comments from the hosts and callers, culminating in Jones hanging up.  Following this, "Jackie the Knife Girl," a stripper, was a studio guest, with Rob using knives to scratch and rub her body while she made sounds of pleasure. Multiple O&A team members were present.

The show continued with a call from Uncle John, recounting a story about a friend awkwardly selling overpriced baseball cards. This was followed by a lengthy performance by John Valby, whose sexually explicit songs were heavily censored by the dump button.  The hosts and callers commented on the songs and the dump button's effectiveness.

The final segment featured John Valby in studio, beginning with sexually suggestive jokes.  Valby shared anecdotes including a heckling incident in Germany and a police stop due to protests about allegedly racist lyrics. A female caller recounted being coaxed onstage by Valby, exposing her breasts. The conversation turned to foot-and-mouth disease and the German army's response, followed by more calls and sexually explicit conversation.  Valby performed more comedic songs, with the hosts discussing censorship.  The segment's latter half focused heavily on O.J. Simpson, his recent altercation with his girlfriend, and included numerous jokes, speculation about his guilt, and a hypothetical violent video game.  The segment concluded with more crude jokes and show promotion.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony, 1027 WNEW.  Which is a no-crunching bathroom back here. It's for urination only, because it stinks the whole studio off, because there's no ventilation.  And everyone that works at NEW knows that.  Knows that, but somebody, somebody from, I don't know, from this group of people that are hanging out today, didn't know the rules, and they took a crunch in the no-crunch bathroom, Anthony.  Maybe that's how they make their plaster casting material. 
[00:00:30]  And it stinks to high hell.  Yeah.  I was relating a story to Anthony. I was on the Long Island Railroad today.  They should just give up on having bathrooms on the Long Island Railroad.  It was a cute idea, you know, the port-a-potties, famous field, you know, sometimes you get on a train and they're brand new.  Today, I had to take a leak so bad, I got up and I went in one of those things.  It looked like a damn crime scene.  Crap all over the world.  And then you sit there, you sit there, and you try to think in your head, what has to happen for that material to get over there? 
[00:01:00]  To get on the wall.  Totally serious.  Like, this thing would have to have derailed and flipped over with somebody in mid-crunch.  Is there some type of ramp in between Mineola and Jamaica that I don't know about? 
[00:01:30]  Like, how did that get over there?  You would have to physically pick it up.  Like, what were they, they were transporting gorillas or something, and they were just throwing their feces.  You could do that, or there's just a bunch of animals.  That's probably it.  Don't give an F.  A bunch of animals in human clothing.  Just give up on the bathrooms on the Long Island Railroad.  It's over, Johnny.  Can you hold it?  The train we were on last night, we were in the first car, and the second car was empty.  Why?  Because something exploded in the bathroom in the second car. 
[00:02:00]  It exploded.  And it just smelled high hell.  Half the doors wouldn't work in the second car.  That's true.  I forgot about that.  That's hard, man.  And I'm walking by, and I'm looking at people who are laying down.  It's either they're sleeping or they passed out from the few days.  And then I'm thinking the whole thing.  You just remember me of another one.  Last week, I had to take another week so bad, and I just, you know, there were no lights in the car and no lights in the bathroom, and I just stepped in.  I'm like, man, the floor's a little wet. 
[00:02:30]  Turns out the toilet overflowed.  Overflowed.  And how bad is it that the toilet overflows?  Because isn't it kind of like a port-a-potty where it's just like, you know, deep ones where it like falls into a sloshing aisle.  Oh, no, it was just coming into the regular cars, under the doors, like, oh, God.  You should have seen it.  Ops walking back and all here. 
[00:03:00]  No.  Walking down the aisle.  What did I say to you?  I was like, Rick, you're not going to believe this, but I got errrt all over my shoes.  Whenever you go into one of those bathrooms, you come out with some type of life form on your shoes.  That's so funny.  It's so funny, too.  Everyone convinced Ant and I have limos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, he's on a crap-filled Long Island Railroad train.  And I'm pissed off at FedEx drivers on the West Side Highway. 
[00:03:30]  And Ant's in the West Side Highway maze every day.  Yeah, the new maze.  I think they just throw a bunch of children Legos.  And then wherever they build barriers, that's where they build them the next day on the West Side Highway.  Oh, this wall wasn't here yesterday.  But you have a FedEx story you want to share with everyone?  Well, you were talking about your fun commute on the Long Island Crap Road.  Long Island Railroad with the bathrooms that look like a feces explosion.  Yeah.  But, yeah, I drive, and I take the West Side Highway to and from work every day. 
[00:04:00]  And last night, I get my road rage.  You know that.  You've seen it in action.  But it's usually justified.  Yeah, it really is.  Last night, when you take 11th Avenue into the West Side Highway, it kind of whittles down on the lanes until you get onto the West Side Highway.  Two lanes from about four.  I'm in the extreme right lane.  No one should be annoying me because there's a lane to my left.  And that's what they have to deal with.  This FedEx truck is squeezing me between the cement barrier and his truck. 
[00:04:30]  Why?  Because he doesn't want me in front of him because he's racing his other friend who's in a big FedEx box truck in front of him.  They're having a race down 11th Avenue and then onto the West Side Highway.  Now I'm pissed because I stepped on the brakes, beat the horn, he got in front of me.  He wins, right?  I was supposed to be in there.  He squeezed me out.  He wins.  No.  I don't think so.  No.  Now I'm there. 
[00:05:00]  I picked up my Snapple bottle and was opening the sunroof and my girlfriend grabbed my arm and said, no.  I was ready to whale it.  So I roll the window down and he's parked just, he's next to me, just a little too far forward for me to see him.  But I could see his windows open and stuff and I yell out, nice job, ass F.  And he goes, I hear a voice go, oh, good one.  So now I feel stupid because I said ass F.  You didn't use the proper cursory.  I was like, nice job, ass F. 
[00:05:30]  And I just hear.  I'm definitely a mother F-er.  Yeah.  You should have used the mother F-er, not ass F.  Good one.  Like he doesn't even care.  He got me.  He won.  So now I'm, I'm livid.  My head is ready to explode.  I'm livid pissed.  Yeah.  So I'm looking for any space between him and his buddy's truck because they're racing Opie.  And you know something?  His friend's going to win because of me.  The light turns green.  His buddy in the first FedEx truck speeds up. 
[00:06:00]  He doesn't get right on it.  I cut, I swear to God, I didn't care if he was right into my door.  I pulled over.  He's beeping at me.  Get right in front of him.  Now I am closing down the West Side Highway.  We get on.  I'm right in front of him, weaving back and forth.  He's jamming on the brakes, beeping his horn.  He's screaming obscenities out the window.  You're that guy.  And his buddy.  You're that guy.  No, I was pissed.  His buddy's taking off.  You know, his buddy's winning.  I am jamming on the brakes. 
[00:06:30]  He's not getting around me.  I see him go to one side.  Whoop, I'm over.  I'm over the other side.  F you, you're not moving anywhere.  Finally, his buddy sees what's happening, slows down.  And starts yelling at him.  Knock it off.  Or he's beeping his horn.  Like, stop it.  And I go, yeah.  And I'm flipping the bird.  I go, ha ha.  Yeah, mother effer.  Real funny.  Ha ha.  I go, what are you going to do?  I dial that number on the side.  You lose your job.  You can't do anything to me.  You mother.  And I'm laughing because now you know something?  I won. 
[00:07:00]  I won.  You won.  I won.  And he was pissed.  He was pissed.  He was going right to the depot over there on the west side of the FedEx depot.  But these guys are racing each other.  And almost squeezed me out.  I couldn't take it.  My little bit of road rage from last night.  Very good.  Mother.  That's always something to you.  Aff, aff.  You aff, aff.  You have a story every day, Anthony.  We should start the show with your road rage minute.  It does.  There is something every day.  Where I'm picking up a handful of change and throwing it at a cabbie. 
[00:07:30]  I tip them when they do something bad because I got to throw something.  So I pick up like the change that I got in my console and just, ass, ass.  I'm throwing the change at him.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I did not even pick him up and he's giving me money.  I miss driving with you, man.  Oh, it's a treat.  You used to be an adventure every day.  It's a treat.  And then I got to quickly say hi to the girl that was working the counter at the Blockbuster.  Over on Avenue U in Brooklyn.  Well, I go in and I was looking for, I'm over here now. 
[00:08:00]  The video, Dice's video.  I see the box.  There's no tape behind him.  There's a whole wall of end of days.  No one's renting that.  But the Dice thing's out.  She'll go up to the counter and ask the girl where I'm over here now is.  She goes, oh, I'm over here now.  That's so funny when Dice does it.  I love it.  I listen to Opie and Anthony all the time.  I'm like, oh, yeah?  She goes, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, that's 320.  She had no clue?  No clue.  But, like, I'm talking, so you kind of get my voice, and my Blockbuster card says Anthony  on it, and I'm looking for the Dice video. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know.  I'm over here now.  We're not that famous, Opie, where people know us from sight.  Well, they don't know our face, but it was funny.  We just kind of, you know, walk out.  That has happened to me on the Long Island Railroad many times, where, like, someone takes  a big crap and be a stumper.  Like, two guys or whatever will be in the next D.O.P., and they'll start talking about our  show.  Yeah.  And then the one guy will say the one thing I never want to hear.  What?  Do you listen to those guys?  And now I don't want to hear the answer.  Yeah.  La, la, la, la.  I am not listening.  So now I'm like, I have to change my seat, because I have no desire to hear what they 
[00:09:00]  really think of us.  Yeah.  When you're sitting right next to them on the Long Island Railroad.  You get all like...  I'm like, man, they don't even know.  You get that weird feeling.  They don't even know I'm right behind them.  Oh, those guys suck.  Or this one.  I'll be driving on the LIE.  Yeah.  And when I see the WOW stickers, I get very excited, because, you know, it's our thing.  You know, it's our thing.  Yeah.  So I'll get right next to the guy that, you know, has the WOW sticker, and I'll start beeping  like, yo, it's us.  It's me. 
[00:09:30]  And he looks at me like I'm a raving lunatic.  And, like, most of the times, they'll give me the finger like, no, I'm not looking for  guys' ass.  I'm looking for chicks to WOW.  To WOW me, you two.  I thought I was getting WOWed, because I heard the beeping.  And I was like, no, I just wanted to say, hey, look, thank you for putting our sticker  on your car.  You suck.  Right.  Well, dude, put yourself in their position.  If you're driving along, listening to something on the radio, maybe you'll listen to a song or  something, you look over, some guy's honking at you, pointing at himself, like, what 
[00:10:00]  the freak is this losing problem?  You're right.  But I get excited when I see the WOW stickers.  I want to tell people, thank you for supporting the show, because you also support the show  by putting the WOW in the car.  You need to carry a sign that just says, I'm Opie.  Right.  And just hold it up to the window.  And then every once in a while, you get the guy, like, they're giving you the finger and  stuff.  And then just as you start slowing down or speeding up, they finally realize.  And they're like, oh, hey, you know?  But then at that point, it's too late.  You're going off an exit or something.  On the back of the sign, F you too late. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  Let's go to Sean.  Sean, you're next on WNEW.  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  Hey.  I got a good story, a Long Island Railroad story.  Oh, okay.  It was about July 4th weekend.  Myself, my buddy, and his girlfriend are going into the city.  We're feeling good, you know, quite in the bag.  And so my buddy and his girlfriend are getting a little frisky.  So they decided to go into the bathroom.  No, I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know if you've seen that.  You're complaining about the bathrooms on the weekdays.  They actually clean it on the weekdays.  You should see it on the weekends.  I've gone to the city on the weekends. 
[00:11:00]  You're right.  It's even worse.  It's scary.  So anyway, I go in there.  I've been in there.  I come out.  I did my thing.  About 10 minutes go by, they do a little sneak into there.  So I'm thinking, my goodness, what could they be doing in there?  Because I know the place is disaster.  So about 10 minutes later, they come out.  They both got big smiles, big grins on.  So, you know, I'm laughing.  I know what they did.  And he's going up and, you know, she turns around and goes to sit in her seat.  And she's got crap all over the bottom of her pants.  I am not surprised. 
[00:11:30]  I'm telling you.  I am not surprised.  It's Saturday night at about 1130.  We're headed into New York to go out to a club.  So now, my buddy, I give him my name.  His name is Kevin.  He's going to kill me.  But anyway, he doesn't notice, right, because he's sitting across from us.  So I'm laughing.  I'm dying laughing.  I don't know what to do.  So about 20 more minutes go by.  We're about, we're in the tunnel now.  And she's like, do you hear that?  Do you smell that?  She's saying.  I'm like, what are you talking about? 
[00:12:00]  I said, that must be a tunnel.  The tunnel is probably, you know, clogged with the fumes.  She's like, no, it smells like, you know, poop.  I'm like, I don't know.  I don't know.  He's like, yeah, I smell it too.  So I stopped playing dumb because I'm having the best time of my life now.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm playing dumb.  All of a sudden, she puts her hands in her back pocket.  She pulls it out, and there it is.  All right.  All right.  So it was pretty good.  You know, I almost had a, I almost had a talk into going out with just a bikini on. 
[00:12:30]  My boyfriend wasn't ill for that, though.  All right, Sean.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Anyone who would want to have sex in one of those Long Island Railroad bathrooms, I mean,  that's a class move.  That's almost like a, on the train.  In a bar bathroom or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, get on the toilet, honey.  Well, on the train, though, it's moving, and things are, it's just, yeah.  And then they make the announcement on the Long Island Railroad every night.  Please take your feet off the seat.  Oh, yeah, that's the big problem on these trains. 
[00:13:00]  You've been in the bathroom lately.  Crap all over the walls, but you're worried about my feet on a seat.  That's great.  EJ, what's going on?  Yo, Anthony, you inspired me.  Yeah.  With your road rage.  You know when you're driving and somebody, like, makes a left turn for the street and  you've got to slam on your brakes?  Yeah.  Yeah, some a-hole just did that to me.  I slammed on my brakes, beeped the horn, just screaming, hey, you ass-aff.  Yeah, ass-aff.  Ass-aff. 
[00:13:30]  Yes.  Yeah, good one.  The faceless person in the FedEx truck last night.  Where's Brewer when you need him?  Deke.  Good one, Deke.  Deke.  Hey, Hammer.  Hey, Hammer.  Walk it off.  Deke.  Nice head.  You know, see, Bobby wants to explain the complaint numbers on the truck.  I'm not going to turn the guy in.  Believe me.  I used to drive like a maniac when I was working for air conditioning, and I had the how am  I driving thing on the back of my truck.  Yeah.  I changed the numbers with electrical tape. 
[00:14:00]  I don't know who was getting yelled at every night after I'd drive like a lunatic.  But, no, I'm not going to turn the guy in, but I'll tell you one thing.  He's not winning.  He's not beating me.  And I'll call him an ass-aff.  Good one.  I like that.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You will never see a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  1027. 
[00:14:30]  Inclusive.  WNEW.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  212-757-1027.  Neal, what's up?  You guys just got done saying that any moron could be a DJ.  Yeah.  Any moron could do your job.  You got screwed up two commercial breaks in a row.  Wow.  Two spots in a row.  You don't want to hire me.  I think you're going to have to work for the radio station. 
[00:15:00]  I'm going to work for myself on the radio.  We blame it on Pete.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Neal, you're a tool.  Cowbell Bill in the studio.  Hey.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, Chris?  Yeah, I know you guys probably don't want to talk about this, but you guys are talking about it for a long time.  Sam, man, you saw 80-year-old big ****.  Brings back bad memories.  All right, we'll get him to the next story.  All right, Chris, it was 80-year-old taint, which is even more gross.  Taint.  Oh, man.  Yeah, let's get Bill to tell that story finally. 
[00:15:30]  All right, peace with me.  All right, man.  A wrinkled mess.  Mr. Movie Phones on the hotline, Anthony.  Hello.  Oh, we get all the top guests on the show.  Mr. Movie Phones.  What's Mr. Movie Phones got today?  We had Vince McMahon on the show yesterday, and today, Mr. Movie Phones.  Mr. Movie Phones.  Should we say hi to Mr. Movie Phones?  Hey, Mr. Movie Phones.  Hello, and welcome to WNEW.  Or O.P. and Anthony Breslawn.  That's the guy.  You do get all the good guests, don't you? 
[00:16:00]  You're the Movie Phones guy.  I can't believe I'm talking to Mr. Movie Phones.  Yeah, see, sometimes good things in life happen.  You're like, you're the guy.  That's right.  Listen to the voice.  That's him.  How do we know it's you?  You know it's...  Would anybody else talk like this?  I mean, come on.  I bet you Anthony could give you a run for your money.  No.  I can't talk like Mr. Movie Phones.  All right, give us a little Mr. Movie Phones.  All right, here we go.  All right.  Hello, and welcome to Movie Phones.  If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see, press one. 
[00:16:30]  Hey, very nice.  I'm not used to that.  Well, tell me what's on one.  What's on...  You know what?  I got nothing.  Describe a kind of movie.  I got nothing on one.  Press the other one.  Hey, Mr. Movie Phones.  Really?  Yeah.  We have to decide if we want to talk to you or our friend Cowbell Bill  that has a story about 80-year-old Tate.  You ever hear of 80-year-old Tate?  No, but I'd go with it. 
[00:17:00]  You know, because you don't get that every day.  That's true.  We could just call you up anytime.  Yeah, well, you know, I'm a very busy man myself.  I got a couple things to do.  Mr. Movie Phones, why don't you do something in that fine voice of yours  if you want to hear about 80-year-old Tate Push 3 or something.  Hello, and welcome to Tate Phone.  If you're registered in 80-year-olds, press one.  No, press the other one.  Holy Christ, man.  What are you guys doing there? 
[00:17:30]  How bad do you want to shoot yourself?  Yeah, pretty badly right about now.  I liked on Seinfeld when Kramer was doing the movie phone guy.  Yeah, wasn't that correct?  From his house, because everybody would call up,  so he'd have the paper there and try to just do the job himself.  Press one, and he didn't know what they were pressing.  That was pretty funny.  That was awesome.  That was a good moment in movie phone history.  So, Mr. Movie Phone, what are you promoting?  Are you promoting...  What are we promoting?  Well, you know the Oscars are coming up.  Do you know anything about movies?  Well, a little bit. 
[00:18:00]  A little bit.  Yeah, and we've been doing our Movie Phone Movie Goer Awards.  You guys know about that?  No.  No.  Yeah, every year for the last six years.  You know, Movie Phone's the nation's largest movie guy,  about five million people a week calling us,  and saying, hello.  Hello, there are...  Your voice.  Yeah, that's right.  And we've been doing the Movie Goer Awards,  because we figured, hey, it's us who are spending the, what now,  ten bucks in New York,  so we should be able to vote for who we think should win  Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, et cetera.  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  So we've been doing that, and we have the winners,  which is very exciting.  So who do you guys think the movie goers voted for Best Picture this year?  Chocolat.  Chocolat.  You have not selected Chocolat.  I just like the way you say that.  Well, my God, everybody all of a sudden has a French friggin' lilt on their voice.  Yeah.  No, it...  I say it's chocolate.  I'm going to go with that crouching thing.  Interesting.  Crouchy Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Gladiator. 
[00:19:00]  Or Gladiator, press one.  Yes, Gladiator.  Yes.  It's Gladiator.  Yeah, movie goers voted that one as number one by a large margin.  Well, the Academy will F that up and give it to Chocolat or Billy Elliot or one of those.  You know damn well that Gladiator is not a movie that the Academy is going to like.  Well, you never know.  You know, everybody's kind of thought that about American Beauty last year,  but, you know, when we started doing these awards about six years ago,  none of the movies were even the same.  You know, we'd have Adam Sandler movies,  and we'd have The Spy Who Shagged me, stuff like that. 
[00:19:30]  But what's happened is the Academy is actually starting to come more in line with movie goers  and kind of pay attention to that, hey, you know,  if these people are loving these movies, we maybe better pick one here and there.  And so, you know, they're actually, it'll be interesting to see.  How about best actor?  Who do you think one, who do you think movie goers think should be best actor?  Chocolat.  Chocolat.  What are our choices?  What are your choices?  Well, you have Russell Crowe.  You have Tom Hanks.  You have Tom Hanks. 
[00:20:00]  Ed Harris.  Ed Harris?  Javier Bardem, you like to say that.  Oh, yeah.  What movie would you say?  That was before Nightfall.  Yeah, that was a big movie.  No, yeah, Russell Crowe.  Movie goers, they love the Russell Crowe.  Your poll is based on...  Hundreds of thousands of movie goers.  Right, and it's actually the way people think.  Right.  And probably a lot of chicks and gay guys love the Gladiator movie.  And they love the Russell Crowe. 
[00:20:30]  They do.  So that's a big vote right there.  As far as the Academy goes, they will look down on that movie, I believe.  And Tom Hanks, I mean, come on.  Tom Hanks, how many of these does the guy need?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's remember Bosom Buddies, for God's sake.  Yeah, he didn't even talk for half of this damn movie, was he?  Yeah.  You know, and here's what...  Oh, okay, so Best Actress.  Who do you think movie goers would go for?  Our choices again?  Your choices for Best Actress are for Juliette Pindolish.  Press one.  Is that the Chocolat lady?  That's more Chocolat, yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, Julia Roberts and Aaron Brockman.  Press two.  Right?  I don't know about that.  Joan Allen, the contender, press three.  Oh, no.  All right, well, I'll take you straight.  Julia Roberts.  Yeah, Julia Roberts.  That's all right.  Julia Roberts.  Yeah, but you know, so, but it'll be interesting, because there's some chance that the Academy  will choose the same way.  I think there are pretty good chances here, but we have a couple other interesting categories,  like Best Line in a Movie.  Oh, all right.  Let's hear the categories.  Yeah, that's...  Okay, so I'll read the lines, and then you guys tell me if you can name the movie, all 
[00:21:30]  right?  Okay.  All right, here we go.  I have made fire.  Chocolat.  I made fire?  Yeah, who said I have made fire?  Come on.  This one isn't that tough.  Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks, Castaway.  All right, very good.  Now, this was my favorite.  It didn't win, but it was my favorite.  Are you ready?  Suck it?  Oh, that was one of the other movies.  What's your point?  That's the movie line.  All right, here we go.  It's close.  Okay.  I have nipples, Greg.  Could you milk me?  Ah, Meet the Parents. 
[00:22:00]  Meet the Parents.  Wow, Orbit.  That was a great line.  Yeah, it was, but the big winner is, they're called boobs, Ed.  Wait, man, you didn't even let us guess.  Well, yeah, I just figured you'd never...  Okay, but what do you think the best line in a movie was?  They're called boobs, Ed.  They're called boobs, Ed.  That is exactly right.  Now, would you like to go on for $32,000?  You know what, though?  I don't know what movie that was in.  You don't know what they're called boobs, Ed? 
[00:22:30]  You don't know what movie that was?  Don't worry.  Aaron Brockovich.  Oh, Aaron Brockovich.  Right.  Aaron Brockovich.  Aaron Brockovich.  Right, Aaron Brockovich.  Aaron Chocolat.  Now, Mr. Movie Phone, I've got to ask you, how did you get this gig?  I am the founder.  I'm the founder of Movie Phone about 10 years ago.  Wait a minute.  I've got to know how this started.  Do you want to puke?  What?  Go ahead.  Explain, Mr. Movie Phone thing.  How did you go from sitting there going, hmm, it's so hard to pick up a goddamn newspaper  and look at the theater and the time, so I got this thing, this idea. 
[00:23:00]  You know what, that's not so far from wrong.  Many years ago, I felt I was unemployable.  I was sitting around trying to figure out, hey, what the hell can I earn a living at?  I was trying to go to the movies.  I didn't read a newspaper.  I mean, I didn't subscribe to it.  I would call theater.  I'd get busy signals.  And I thought, you know, movie going is a pain in the ass.  How do I make it easy?  Hey, what if you created a service that was one phone number?  It would be easy to remember, like 777 film.  You'd have all the movies.  You'd put in your zip code.  It'd give you the theaters nearest you. 
[00:23:30]  I said, hell, I'd use it.  I bet some other people would use it, too.  So literally, that's how it started.  It started with a couple guys, me and one other guy.  And you had to be the voice.  Of course I had to be the voice.  You know, who else could pull off the press one?  If you're bored, press one.  Hey, come on.  I like hearing this.  Yeah, don't do that.  Stop with that.  Yeah, the other guy actually sounded like Donald Johnson.  We told him I was guilty.  Yeah, come on.  Stop pressing law. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, so the largest movie guy in America, 5 million cars.  We sold it to AOL about a year and a half ago.  And now you're a rich son of a bitch, aren't you?  Wow.  How much did AOL give you?  $480 million.  Hello, anybody home?  Wait, that's not a joke figure?  No, that's serious.  $480 million because you were sitting on your couch and you wanted to go to the movies.  Right, exactly.  It's a great country, isn't it?  This is something that if Ralph Cramden tried it, it would have just been one of those failures.  No, I've not got an idea.  You know what?  It sounds like one of those crazy harebrained schemes, Ralph. 
[00:24:30]  If you're jealous of this guy, press two.  Oh, press two.  Stop that.  Stop that.  He said stop that.  Yeah, stop that.  That'd be enough of that.  Wow.  Yeah.  You won the lottery.  Yeah, but, you know, we worked hard.  But it's, you know, all that press one, press two business, seeing those movies, you know,  it's a tough job.  You've got to take a sip of water between the reeds.  That's exactly right.  If you're looking for a sugar daddy, press three.  Yeah, I told you about that.  I told you I've had enough. 
[00:25:00]  Are you married?  Are girls looking nice?  I'm engaged to a lovely young lady.  Holy stuff.  If you need a prenup, press one.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Yeah, it's all good.  It's not about the money.  It's about the movies, my friend.  Of course it's about the movies.  Yes.  You're very passionate about movies.  And it's not moviephone.com.  Hey, can you say Ron Concoma?  A-L-L-K-Word moviephone.  Can you say Ron Concoma for us?  Ron Concoma.  All right.  Someone, uh...  Did I screw that up?  Tony says when you call Mr. Moviephone, you can't pronounce Ron Concoma. 
[00:25:30]  I'm sure that's true.  I have a little problem with the foreign films.  Ron Concoma.  Oh, by the way, I bet it is Ron Concoma.  Ron Concoma, yeah.  Well, what the hell, man?  Does it look like Ron Concoma?  It's a little town on Long Island, New York.  Yeah.  Not familiar with it.  Well, obviously, Ron Concoma.  You know, and I get a call periodically from a producer of a foreign film who has a little  problem with the name or the way I pronounce those films.  Oh, the foreign film. 
[00:26:00]  Well, you know, there's a little film out called Cest LaVie.  If you have a higher IQ than me, press 5.  Cest LaVie.  Cest LaVie.  I got it.  Okay, I told you about that.  Hey, hey.  We talked about this, didn't we?  We got beat up by Mr. Moody's phone.  He's scolding me.  Ralph Cramden is checking in on instant feedback.  He said, me and Norton did have the idea, but I didn't have a phone.  Remember that?  He used to have to go down there and use Norton's phone.  Yeah.  And you couldn't press the button.  Ring one.  Yeah, what happened? 
[00:26:30]  You really needed the push button.  Are you talking to me?  I have no idea what the hell you're talking to.  Thank God for push button phones.  Yeah, yeah.  It's still rotary phones.  You've been screwed.  That's right.  Push button phones, computers, they've all been very handy.  Hey, I want to do more of this survey thing.  Any other questions left?  The Movie Phone Movies Award?  Yeah.  No, but what you can do is you can go to moviephone.com.  And, you know, we've got a lot of Oscar stuff on there, Oscar trivia, so you can impress  your friends.  We've got, we'll even tell you what kind of food to serve.  You guys having an Oscar party? 
[00:27:00]  No.  All righty, then.  That'll wrap it up for today.  Thanks for calling.  You've made an invalid selection.  Please try again.  Any porno on that?  What?  Every site you go to now has porno on it.  Yeah, no, Movie Phone doesn't have any porn.  No.  That says it's AOL.  That'll help your hit, sir.  Yeah, I'm sure that will.  That'll make the page view skyrocket.  Yeah.  Yeah, not much money on that, though.  If you did zero work for $480 million, press 1. 
[00:27:30]  If you're a well-deserving young man with vision, press 2.  If you're a highly underpaid radio disc jockey looking to be Mr. Movie Phone, press 3.  You got it.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  All right, Mr. Movie Phone guy.  You know what?  You guys are a party.  Don't let anybody tell you different.  You're a lot of fun there yourself, Mr. Movie Phone.  Well, thanks so much.  Thanks for having me.  Come out to Roncon Coma someday.  I'll be there soon.  Take it easy.  I'm on my way.  All right.  Goodbye.  Mr. Movie Phone.  Mr. Movie Phone.  Look at him.  He's a little smart-ass. 
[00:28:00]  $400.  Oh!  Boy, that AOL's got some money to kick around.  I thought he was being sarcastic.  That's what I thought, too.  When he said $400,000, I'm like, $400,000 before he said million?  $400 million.  Movie Phone.  All right.  All the great guests.  At least he had a little sense of humor there.  He told you to knock it off with the B-B-B thing.  Because, you know, every time he's on the phone, people are like,  hey, look, I'm like, I'm pretty much more than Mr. Movie Phone guy's on the phone.

You know we're going to be doing that.  Matt, what's up? 
[00:46:30]  I got my two-and-a-half-year-old here.  We're sitting here.  Wait a minute.  We're sitting right here at the Great River train station.  We're waiting for mommy to come home.  And we're sitting there listening to the song,  and all you hear from the car is just,  Hey, we got to draw the line, man.  They've got to be in double digits.  Have you seen this chick pick yet? 
[00:47:00]  No.  Well, it's me and the Olsen.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've got my arms around him.  Yeah.

Yo, you were off the hook, yo.  Off the hook, yo.  I was just kind of upset that he didn't do his John Madden impersonation there.  He doesn't do John Madden.  Oh, my bad.  He's trying to make a joke, sir.  I'm sorry, guys.  Was that you being funny?  No, not really.  Just being stupid.  Oh. 
[00:50:00]  Sorry, guys.  All right.  That's just Frank Caliendo, who does the John Madden impression, was doing the Brian  Regan impression.  Oh, no.  The flow today.  Yeah.  He does do a great impression for you.  Do we have that?  I've got to work on a Madden in the meantime.  Yeah.  He does a great Madden.  God damn, the guy sounds just like him.  We got it, right?  Yeah, I'm looking at pictures of our best ass that does it.  Supposed to be concentrating on the show.  It is.  Brian looks over on my screen.  I'm looking at pictures of naked women over there. 
[00:50:30]  I'm just looking at Mira.  Mira, whose photos were taken, what, yesterday?  Myra?  Myra, yeah.  I would say firmly entrenched in the lead in my book.  Jesus Christ, that's an ass.  Today's the last day that the girls can come down and show off their asses, Brian.  How many contestants are there?  We have about 20.  Look at this.  20, probably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  There's a whole bunch of them.  Look at this one.  40 cheeks.  Right there.  Great.  And they show their ass. 
[00:51:00]  They take pictures.  And there's a prize?  Oh, yeah.  A trip to Vegas.  Man, oh, man.  And then we put their pictures.  We whittled it down to a few finalists.  And then we put their pictures on the website.  And the listeners get to vote for the best ass on the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank you, Pinnacle Hornigowie, for sponsoring that.  Is there a lady out there?  Or is she doing business with the station?  What is she doing?  She's here for a reshoot.  A reshoot?  One of those pictures is getting reshot?  Yeah.  I wasn't putting my best ass forward or what? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, my best cheek forward.  Well, you know what happened?  There was a problem.  Some of the earlier contestants, if I could show you, Brian, if you look at contestant one  or two, the pictures, very clinical.  It looked like a friggin' lipo ad or something, you know?  Yeah.  And then...  What kind of photographer you had taking those shots?  Yeah, and then as we go down to, like, you know, a couch is involved.  Yeah, that's unfair, man. 
[00:52:00]  The chick's on all fours.  I mean, look at that.  Look at that.  A cat with schoolgirl dresses, stockings, a spanking going on.  And then, uh, now let's go back to, let's say, contestant two and see what we got here.  Completely unfair disadvantage there.  Yeah.  Hey, go Patty.  Oh, you want to see soccer Patty?  Patty actually entered.  She's going to touch the number three.  Here's, uh, her...  All right.  Look at that, look at that. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Okay.  I like to speak, you know, good for her.  Speak, you know.  You spoke volumes, my brother.  Look at that.  Hey, Anthony, we saw Frank Caliendo doing Brian Regan.  Oh, he did?  All right.  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  Hey, you've had Regan on?  Oh, yeah.  Brian Regan, what?  Imagine if we go, yeah, he's sorry.  He did all that out, right?  Well, we had it out on the...  What a pain in the ass, that guy.  Like a pompous ass, needs limos.  Oh, I didn't realize that was all on the clip.  I'm sorry, Brian. 
[00:53:00]  All right, here it is.  Frank Caliendo.  Hey, you've had Regan on?  Oh, yeah.  Regan, one of our faves.  Well, you're going to go over here.  I've got a joke for you.  Here's a little joke.  I'm going to move over to the side, and I moved over.  Can't see it on the radio.  Can't see me moving on the radio.  It would have been a funny movement.  That's one of the funniest humans in life.  Brian is great, man.  Yeah, I'm going to get a jelly donut.  Give me a jelly donut. 
[00:53:30]  Give me, give me, give me, what are you doing?  You said Brian Regan's timing.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do with your timing?  Do you, John Madden?  Do you, John Madden, Norm Macdonald?  What about Norm Macdonald working at McDonald's?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  For your impressionist guy.  I'm really getting into it now.  Mr. Impressionist guy.  I know he's really nice, too, and I'm making it sound like he's mean.  No, we love him.  What's going on over here?  What are you doing? 
[00:54:00]  Doing impressions.  Doing funny voices.  That's good.  I like that.  Work on it.  Work on it sometime.  Work on it.  Do it better.  Do it better.  Do it.  More people call in.  Call in saying, do a better job.  There it is.  Oh, man.  That's pretty good, huh?  That's great.  Frank Caliano.  Isn't that weird?  Am I just trying to do you?  Do your voice.  I'm embarrassed because I can't live up to that, man.  You're like a bump in a log after Frank. 
[00:54:30]  Vito.  Hey.  What's up?  One.  First time I got a chance to talk to you.  It's a cool thing.  Brian.  Yes.  My God.  I was there last night.  We were like front table.  You were hysterical.  Hey, thanks for coming out.  Oh, my God.  That wasn't me, though.  That was Frank Caliano.  No, no.  I saw you.  I've heard Caliano, but no, that was, oh, my God.  You were so funny last night.  I appreciate that.  You made my birthday, man.  Thanks.  Man, happy birthday.  I'm telling you guys, we're going tonight.  Yeah, we say it every time Brian's in town.  He's got to be good because we are really, really tired and spent after last night, but 
[00:55:00]  we are going tonight.  Still going.  I know.  Still going.  We're going.  Rick was saying you guys had, like, a midget kiss group or something?  Yeah.  I don't know if that's a politically correct group.  Well, they don't like being called midgets.  They want to be called dwarves.  Dwarves.  All right.  Is that true?  Yeah.  And they were all in the kiss makeup.  Dwarves or dwarves?  Dwarves.  Dwarves.  I don't know.  Dwarves.  Kiss dwarves.  Kiss dwarves.  Little dwarves.  Little people.  That's cool, man. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, they came out with all the makeup on and they were the lip shing.  They didn't really play.  Oh.  You know, that would have been about edges.  My God, if they played.  Imagine that.  That was hilarious.  They walk on stage with their little bodies all dressed in the kiss makeup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a freak show last night.  I'm sitting here feeling bad.  I said midget before.  I didn't realize it was politically incorrect.  Look at you.  Yeah, look at you.  I'm trying to say a good thing about the kiss group and I come right off with the wrong  term.  How do you know?  And then it was like midget.  Midget would seem okay.  Dwarf doesn't seem okay. 
[00:56:00]  Dwarf's like a cartoon thing, right?  Everything gets switched.  Everything you say for a while, then you can't say it anymore.  Yeah.  But I'm always the last to find out.  And you always say the wrong thing.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Dwarf.  Dwarf now comes.  What are these colored Oriental midgets?  You can't say that.  Remember when Oriental was fine?  Yeah.  For a long time.  For a damn long time.  You can't say that anymore.  No, Oriental is, that is an object.  It can be Oriental.  We are Asian. 
[00:56:30]  What the hell did that happen?  It's an Oriental rug, rug, right.  But an Asian person standing on the Oriental rug.  Right.  Got it.  Hey, you know what's with this week?  The girl really dressed up for her Rishu.  This is the Rishu woman.  Let's see.  Should we bring her in a little bit?  Yeah, bring her in.  Now, is Rick going to be doing another clinical?  You know, Rick's kind of learned.  Like a high screen and.  Yeah.  Isn't that horrible?  It looks like a liposuction ad.  It's like a proctologist, you know, handbook.  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Before and after.  You came in for a reshoot?  Yeah.  What was wrong with your original pictures?  Didn't like them?  Did you look at number six?  No.  Your contestant?  Number six.  It's controversial number six.  Nice to talk of the town.  I'm not on a street going.  Did you see number six?  Well, you weren't talking about it on Sunday, though, I heard.  It's a big controversy.  Oh, was this the one where your fingers are on the bottom?  Oh, yeah.  What is that?  That's my hand.  Okay.  We weren't sure if something was popping out of the G-string. 
[00:57:30]  No, it would be in totally wrong place if that were the case.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't even understand what that could be.  Oh, that's Brian.  No.  It's my hand.  You can see where my arm's on.  See this right here?  Oh, I see.  Yeah, but it's her fingers because she's kind of like that.  But a lot of people thought, you know.  She's getting the shot ready, right?  I mean, you know, if they thought that, it makes them happy.  And, hey, I'll be very good.  Hey, you didn't say hi to Brian Reagan.  Hi.  I'm doing good.  How are you?  What did you wear for the reshoot?  You want to take it?  Yeah, sure.  All right.  What? 
[00:58:00]  Why couldn't we have a radio show?  Nice call.  How easy was that, man?  Yeah, right?  Wow.  Okay.  All right.  Got a little thong on.  Bravo.  Very nice.  All right.  Go get your...  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, look at that.  Bravo.  That is very nice.  All right.  Well, go get your pictures, Reagan, and we'll have you back in a little bit, okay?  Okay.  Your money's in on number six there.  The reshoot's always fun and exciting, Opie, because it means the girls are going to really 
[00:58:30]  come ahead.  What do you see, Brian?  Well, I can see, you know, I think the picture didn't do her justice.  Yeah.  See?  Right.  You know, you just saw this live.  There's a weird shadow thing going on.  And this one, whoa, a little glare.  Right.  It doesn't look like that.  And this view with the fingers coming through, it looks like something's poking out of the  bottom of her thong, resembling a piece of veal.  Kevin's going to help Brian Reagan with the midget dwarf thing. 
[00:59:00]  Ah, good.  Kevin?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  Hey, Kevin.  Good.  How's it going, Brian?  Good.  There's a technical difference.  A midget is someone under four feet tall who's perfectly proportioned.  They've got a regular-sized head, regular-sized arms for little bodies.  A dwarf is that little tiny body with the big head.  So, basically, doctors differentiate between the two.  Got it now.  Ah.  So, if these little kids guys had those, you know, those big heads and those funny  little legs, then they're dwarves.  They're not midgets. 
[00:59:30]  They've got their own different associations.  There's midgets of America.  There's dwarves of America.  So, they don't like being confused.  Got it.  And the midgets don't get along with the dwarves?  Apparently not, no.  The dwarves get all the attention, you know.  But everybody, I mean, you make fun of the dwarves more, but the midgets, you know, they  don't get enough recognition.  There's this whole little war going on that we don't even know about.  Imagine, you know, both groups book a convention in the same hotel, and like, they don't know  about the other group, and then, oh, no, there's bad blood in the lobby, man.  The midgets and the dwarves are. 
[01:00:00]  When you're a dwarf, you're a dwarf, all the way.  All right.  You call me a dwarf.  I'm a midget.  Do I look like I'm in proportion?  Yeah.  Do I look like my arms and legs are proportional to the rest of my body?  Who are you calling a midget here?  Oh, boy.  All right, let's go to Brooks. 
[01:00:30]  Another girl showed up to get her pictures done for the Best Ass Contest.  Last day that the girls could come down.  Oh, there's a new girl.  Yes.  Brooks, what's up?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey, Brian, when's your next CD coming out, buddy?  No, no.  I don't have any short-term plans.  I'm, like, lame at planning my career out.  Everybody else has all kinds of goals and aspirations.  I'm like, hey, I never even thought about that.  Maybe I should do another one.  You're just going to your gigs and do the shows and flying home. 
[01:01:00]  Hey, you ever thought about getting on TV?  You know, I see these other guys do it.  They seem to be making a lot of money.  I've got to go out and do something like that.  No, you're right, man.  I appreciate, you know, hopefully you'd want to check it out.  You've got to write one of those wacky comedy books, too, Brian.  That's right, because we all downloaded it.  I mean, bought the first CD.  So, thanks for the second one.  Hey, Brian, was that ass better than the one you saw the last time you were in the studio?  Oh, man, every time I come in here, it's a blast. 
[01:01:30]  In fact, it was, like, a little weird when I came in today,  because last time we were in the studio, there was, like, a naked guy in a swimming pool.  That was on Ron and Ted.  You've seen the rat eaters here.  They had the hemorrhoid touch.  Hemorrhoid, yeah.  Yeah, that was when we finally got these sounds.  I don't play it.  Hemorrhoid, hemorrhoid.  Ow!  Boom!  Those sounds, Brian was here watching the guy administer the Preparation H.  I'm a completely different person since I started coming in here.  You really are, man.  All right, Brooke, thank you.  All right, thanks, guys. 
[01:02:00]  Later.  Well, Karen is the mother of a dwarf.  Oh, no.  Ah!  Well, let's give her some equal time here.  Karen?  Yes.  How are you?  Okay.  You know, there's an organization called Little People's America.  Oh.  Okay.  And the politically correct term is little person.  Little person.  For a dwarf or a midget?  No, it's neither.  You know, it goes back in the days when you're referring to...  Wait, Karen, Karen, I've got to stop you.  We had kiss dwarfs last night.  They wanted to be called dwarfs, not midgets.  Well, actually, they were called mini-kissed, weren't they? 
[01:02:30]  Oh.  No, they called kiss dwarfs.  Yeah, they wanted to be called kiss dwarfs.  Mm-hmm.  So you're saying that neither term is correct?  No, what it is is actually, because being part of Little People of America,  it was founded by Billy Barty, who recently died.  He was a dwarf.  He had a different...  He had cartilage hair syndrome.  What's that?  Well, there's like 4,000 different kinds of dwarfism.  Well, I'm not going to memorize the name for any one of them.  Well, neither am I. 
[01:03:00]  Some of the people, you know, some of them, the most popular form is what you guys usually see,  is achondroplasia.  You're a mother of a dwarf?  Child with dwarfism.  Dwarfism.  And I use it as a noun.  When did you find that out?  Oh.  When did I find that out?  You usually find it out either at birth or a few months after.  How was it with you, a few months after?  Well, the pregnancy must have been easy.  Well, sometimes they get diagnosed later.  You know, there's doctors in university hospitals that specialize.  I mean, your example, you gave birth and then did you know right away or did you... 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, they find out during the pregnancy, even before the child was born.  Oh, how long during your pregnancy did you find out?  They could find out within like, you know, six months when they're doing the sonograms.  Oh, and they did?  And all of a sudden they said, hey, you know, it's like this.  You're going to have a little person.  Or childhood dwarfism and, you know, it's not as big of a deal as people make it sound  out.  Did they give you the choice?  Pardon me?  Did they ask you if you wanted to, you know, be given the choice? 
[01:04:00]  You know?  Well, you have those options with any kind of, any mother has that choice no matter what  it is.  You know, the choice.  The big A.  But you'd never do it.  No?  I'm sure somebody would.  If you guys visited these people that did many kids last night, some of them have families.  Oh, no, I know.  No, no, I'm saying they're great kids.  They have kids with...  We were loving kiss dwarfs last night.  They were great.  And, you know, people with dwarfism, Opie, because I'm not going to use it as a noun. 
[01:04:30]  Do you know, they can have normal-sized children.  Yes, they can.  And that's got to be a trip, huh?  All of a sudden you're towering over mom and dad.  That happens all the time.  How old is your...  Is it a boy or a girl?  Girl.  And how old is she?  Six years old.  Yeah?  Okay.  Six?  Wow.  How about that?  All right, Karen.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  That's a little insight on dwarfism. 
[01:05:00]  There you go, Opie.  All right.  I don't know.  Wouldn't you...  All right, Brian.  I'm staying away from this topic.  I don't know.  Wouldn't you just...  I don't know.  I'd think, eh.  You know, if it doesn't have blonde hair and blue eyes, get rid of it.  Coming from you.  You're making me too extreme.  Thank you.  See, when it's extreme, it's funny.  Yeah, it's my...  The thing growing inside me, is it going to have blonde hair? 
[01:05:30]  No?  All right.  I'm done with it.  I'm done.  Take it away.  Take it out.  I've had my fill.  It's not enough.  All right.  Brian Regan in the studio playing Caroline's all weekend long.  Call Caroline's for tickets.  They're going to go fast, okay?  Yeah.  And someone told me to ask you about kids' books.  Oh, well, you know, I've got a boy myself.  He's two years old, and I've been reading to him, you know.  And is he a dwarf or a midget?  He's a person with height. 
[01:06:00]  With height.  Okay.  Not that that's any better than anybody else, what he is.  Look at Brian.  He's squirming, man.  You stay right on that line, man.  Everyone loves me.  I want to continue that happy feeling.  It's like every time I say something, I've got to, like, go back.  What did I just say now, you know?  Both shows tonight, it's just going to be an hour of corrections and apologies.  When I first came in and talked about stalker Patty, first of all, that was unkind towards her. 
[01:06:30]  So I apologized about that.  Then I said midget, followed up with dwarves.  Both of them are politically incorrect.  I apologize again.  I've got no time for any jokes.  Good night.  And I apologize that I can't do my jokes.  And I'm so sorry.  You know, I've been reading to little Christopher and, you know, these books.  I don't know who's writing children's books.  I just want a piece of the pie, the financial pie to these big cardboard clunky books, you know. 
[01:07:00]  And I have them on my lap, and it's like, the clock.  And you turn this big, chunky page, the big clock.  You turn another page, tick-tock.  You turn another page, the end.  When you look on the back, 12 bucks.  I mean, what?  Are these guys mingling with other authors?  Hey, I read your book, The Clock.  That is a real page-turner. 
[01:07:30]  You know, I was halfway into war and peace, and then somebody told me about this The Clock book.  I had to pick that one up and give it a read.  Do you guys do books on tape?  My wife got me books on tape.  Every once in a while.  Because I can't read fast at all.  If you've got one of those road trips, it makes the time go by, sure.  And I did it so I could, like, read faster, you know, or whatever, get through a book faster.  But the whole point was so I could fit in better at parties, so I would have a little bit of knowledge, which I lack completely now. 
[01:08:00]  But when you do books on tape, you still can't act cool at a party.  People talking about a book, yeah, that book.  I heard that book.  That book's a good lesson.  Because the reading thing is just throwing me for a loop, man.  They say reading makes you smarter.  If that's the case, then how come when you read a book, you have to put the title of the book on the top of every single page?  Does anybody ever get halfway through a book?  What the hell am I reading?  It's right there at the top. 
[01:08:30]  Okay.  I forget again.  Oh, it's right there.  That is handy.  You know what, you go to the movies, I don't put the title of the movie on the top of the screen.  What are we watching?  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Wait, wait, who's that?  What?  Oh, there it is.  It's written clearly.  You know, you don't got to do that.  You got to do that.  You get your ticket stub.  You're not going to be looking up at no screen.  You just take a gander down at your stub and you slip it back in your pocket.  Nobody's the wiser. 
[01:09:00]  That's how you find out what movie you're watching.  Well, reading's good, right?  Sure, sure.  It's hard to badmouth it, you know?  You never see like a Crossfire episode about the benefits of reading, you know?  And in the pro side of reading, it's like a professor with a bow tie.  And in the opposite side, let me tell you something.  Reading, reading ain't never.  Reading ain't not never, Doug.  Reading ain't not never. 
[01:09:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Brian, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I know what you're saying.  Brian Regan.  Yes.  Well, let me take a break.  Goddamn.  Very good, Brian.  Tonight at Caroline.  Yes, join us tonight.  Don't forget, Triple H from the WWF coming in in about a half hour or so.  Are you a wrestling fan, Brian?  You know.  Look at this.  You can't shake this guy. 
[01:10:00]  It's got its merits.  I can translate Brian speak if you would like.  WWF is a complete waste of time and my kid will never, ever, ever, ever watch this.  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  It's got a good entertainment value to it.  There you go.  You know, people get a lot of joy out of wrestling.  Some Nazi snappy dressers.  You know.  Of course, there's a horrible thing, but the organization.  They were organized.  And fine snappy dressers.  Yes, they were. 
[01:10:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  That doesn't sound so bad.  Booyah.  Sucks, man.  From wall to wall.  Booyah.  1027 WNEW.  Ryan Regan in the studio playing Caroline.  It's all weekend long.  We're all going down.  Tickets going fast.  You might want to call Caroline.  And reserve your seats now.  Right, Anthony?  Yeah.  Triple H coming into the studio in about a half hour.  Sorry. 
[01:11:00]  And Matt wants to say hi to Brian.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, Matt.  Hey, Brian Regan.  You're awesome.  Thank you, Matt.  Yeah, I have kind of two questions for you.  All right.  The first one is, I haven't been able to find your first TV yet.  Is it in, like, Power Records?  I don't know if it's there.  If you went to, like, Amazon.com, it would be there.  Okay.  Or Napster.  Well, that's true.  My second question is, do you run a website somewhere?  Yeah, you can just get it for free if you want. 
[01:11:30]  You know, you can get it on Amazon.com, or if you don't want to pay any money, I can always  download it on Napster.  The free is always better.  Well, it's doing to RC, they.  Actually, you know, we don't even care.  I don't care either.  It gets our name out there, you know.  When people told me that, I was, like, so flattered, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like a Metallica thing, I can understand their gripe, you know.  Well, they have a point, but when I heard that I was on there, I was like, man, that's  fantastic, you know.  Hey, do you run your own website anywhere, like stupidpeople.com or something? 
[01:12:00]  Not yet.  So you may have one, too.  I have the domain name.  That's the only stuff I can do.  You deserve the name.  You own brianrigan.com.  It spends that 75 bucks or whatever it is to get the name, and that's about all I know  how to do.  It took me, like, eight months to figure that out.  I'm going to go get your stuff from Napster, then.  I'll book you later.  I don't think you heard the first part.  Amazon.com.  Amazon.com.  That's if you want to pay.  Matt, seriously, Tower Records usually has it in the comedy section. 
[01:12:30]  I've seen it there many times.  And Borders.  Borders.  And Borders?  Okay.  Borders, I never thought to look there.  It's a great CD.  We play clips from it all the time.  Yeah, I know.  That's what I'm trying to get, but I never think to be there.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye, Matt.  Bye.  Here's one of my takes on Napster that I heard.  It's an upgrade.  If you bought vinyl many years ago, and all of a sudden they changed the format of the music, 
[01:13:00]  and it is now, it's not modern, the record player.  So, they put out new equipment, CD players.  Why should I have to then pay again for the same music that I already bought on vinyl?  So, I am just getting the upgrade off of Napster for the music I already have.  These are, like, albums that you've had since the 70s?  That's how I justify it. 
[01:13:30]  He doesn't want to buy, you know, the Yes album.  I'm also all for food borrowing.  You just walk into someone's house, you open their fridge and start eating, and you go,  no, we're just sharing.  I'm file sharing in your refrigerator.  Food sharing.  Oh, man.  So, Brian was telling us a little story about the emergency room.  Yeah.  He was cracking us up.  I had to go myself.  I had, like, a stomach virus thing, and it was 2 o'clock in the morning.  My wife was watching Christopher, so she couldn't take me.  I almost called an ambulance. 
[01:14:00]  And it's weird, like, well, it's weird considering calling an ambulance for yourself.  You know, you always figure you're calling an ambulance for somebody else.  What do you say about yourself?  Can you come get me?  Yeah, I don't feel so hot.  Could you do the code blue where you don't stop for nobody and just come on in?  I'll be sitting on the couch rubbing my belly.  I'm just looking at the phone.  I don't think you're allowed to call an ambulance for yourself.  So I drove myself to the emergency room, which has to be a worse option. 
[01:14:30]  It's 2 o'clock in the morning.  I show up at the entrance, and they don't have any valet parking at the emergency room.  If there's ever a place where they should have a valet parking stand, you know,  if there's ever a time we're going to go,  can you park this because I need to collapse immediately?  But no, I've got to deal with, please take the ticket.  You know, and I'm driving around this lot.  Hey, can I park there?  I think I'm going to die.  I'm dying, too.  Okay, go ahead.  I'll go up a couple levels.  It doesn't matter if you're driving yourself or somebody else. 
[01:15:00]  If you're driving somebody, you still want to hop out with them at the door.  Are you supposed to drop somebody off while you go park?  Okay, you go in.  Tell them you're shot.  Ask them if they validate.  You take care of the bullet wounds, and I'll handle parking.  We'll work it out 50-50.  And then, you know, I go in there at 2 o'clock in the morning. 
[01:15:30]  I would think that that would be all they need to know to start doing stuff.  The fact that you show up at a hospital at 2 a.m.?  Right.  Must mean, hey, he's here.  Start sticking tubes up his nose.  What else are you showing up for?  Man, I'm bored.  I saw your lights on, and I was wondering, who's up for canasta?  I got a hankering for some canasta like you wouldn't believe me. 
[01:16:00]  But I got to, you know, check in with the question they ask.  It kills me.  They say, what seems to be the problem?  The seems part is so insulting.  What seems to be the problem?  Well, it seems.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable.  That's what it seems like.  But, you know, I'm no doctor until it gets analyzed officially by one of your medical staff. 
[01:16:30]  In my own delusional world, it seems like there ain't no moisture left inside me.  They put you in a bag in this room, you know.  It's like they do a half room kind of thing with a curtain down the middle with a mystery patient under the side.  You know, you just see the silhouette over there.  What the hell's the matter with that person? 
[01:17:00]  I'm laying there, and that person over there is moaning, you know.  I'm like, man, they're never going to help me with him moaning like that.  So I got to outmoan him, you know.  He's like, ah, I'm like, ah!  He's cranking it up, ah!  Quit moaning!  We're all hurting!  It's the emergency room!  They know this!  You know, the nurses must just be running around holding their ears.  It's got to be hell to work in this environment! 
[01:17:30]  And then they come in, and the nurse is like, she asks, how are you feeling?  And I said, you know, terrible, you know, do you have like a painkiller?  She goes, how would you describe your pain?  What kind of questions?  Otherworldly?  I don't know.  It's hard for me to find adjectives that can cover this pain. 
[01:18:00]  She goes, well, how would you rate it then?  How would you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain?  Well, you're not saying 2 ain't going to get you nothing.  Right.  Oh, I'm a 2.  Maybe the high 1s.  If you could get me a baby aspirin and cut it in half,  and maybe a Flintstone vitamin, and I'll be out of your hair.  I don't mean to bother you all with my low-level,  flying beneath-the-radar-screen pain level.  I'm 10, I guess, you know. 
[01:18:30]  I was going to say 10, but I backed off,  because I had heard the worst pain a human can endure.  I don't know if this is true,  but I heard it was getting your upper leg bone,  your femur bone cracked in half.  So I thought I'd better not say 10,  because I didn't get my femur bone cracked.  Then I was thinking, what was I worried about?  It was like a femur ward at the hospital.  They'll hear about it and come hobbling into my room.  Who the hell had the audacity to say they were out of level 10?  You know nothing about 10.  Give me a flood jammer. 
[01:19:00]  Let me show you what 10 is all about, Mr. Tummyache.  But I'm fine now.  It ended up I had the sniffles.  Ah, the sniffles.  The sniffles.  What the hell is that?  After all that.  You know what?  You get what we call the sniffles.  You must feel like a moron at that point.  Hey, Anthony. 
[01:19:30]  What?  How do we know he's Brian Regan?  Hmm?  I was just thinking over here.  Someone is on the line saying they're Brian Regan.  I know.  Brian Regan.  What is happening here?  You sure you're Brian Regan?  I always thought I was.  Pop down Brian Regan.  Uh, Brian Regan?  Hello?  Yeah.  I think you've got a phony in the studio.  In the studio.  Screwed up a word.  Couldn't get it out correctly.  Trying to do the word, but it wasn't worth it.  That is me. 
[01:20:00]  Brian's doing a little.  Brian, the real Brian Regan was just in Vegas.  Doing a little gambling.  Putting some money in some machines and getting coins to come out.  The coins coming out just landed in my pockets.  Trade them in to get some dollars.  I didn't realize how simple my material was.  So, man, I was thirsty and bought some water and then drank it.  It was good. 
[01:20:30]  That's funny.  We had to throw that in tonight, man.  Wait a second.  The real Brian Regan would have done a joke instead of just saying stupid things like I did.  The real Brian Regan would have had a bit.  I just talked and repeated what I said until I made people angry.  The real Brian Regan would have said something funny.  I don't have that kind of material.  I don't know about that, man.  Hey, this is Frank Caliendo.  I'm talking with a guest.  How are you doing, Frank?  I'm doing all. 
[01:21:00]  Why am I going to keep being used?  I blew it.  I blew the whole illusion.  How are you doing, me?  You tore it down the wall.  How am I?  Yeah, it's like you're in a play and you talk to the audience.  Hey, what do you think?  We're doing pretty good, huh?  I'm going to get back to talking to King Lear.  You just broke in the fourth wall.  All right, Frank.  All right, Rick just gave me a call.  It's over to call it and mess with Brian.  No, very good job, man.  Brian, I think you nailed it. 
[01:21:30]  If I can't make a gig, I'm going to call you.  Hey, Frank.  There you go, man.  I'll be the short, fat Brian Regan.  Oh, man.  That's very flattering.  Hey, Frank, can I put you on the spot?  Sure.  You got to do just a tiny bit of Al Pacino for Brian.  Mr. Regan, my name's Al.  How are you doing?  I'm doing good.  Listen, I was wondering how I could get into doing some comedy.  I mean, the other day, I was thinking about back in my childhood. 
[01:22:00]  You might have recalled.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Al.  We're losing him.  I'd be really into it.  It's tough when you drive it.  You know what I'm saying?  Anybody listening?  Yeah.  We got you now, man.  Yeah, there you go.  You got a cup of drink.  That's what I was trying to get to.  That's what, Brian.  It didn't work out.  That would blow my mind to see Al Pacino doing my cup of drink.  Cup of drink.  Hey, Jay, it's cup of drink. 
[01:22:30]  It's cup of drink.  It's cup of drink.  Thank you, Frank.  Sorry, it wasn't that funny.  It was good.  Your phone was crapping out on us.  Oh, it wasn't?  Yeah.  Let's blame it on that.  And I look forward to hearing your John Madden one day, too, man.  I hear that's on you.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Hey, hey.  Some day that guy, he went in that and there you go.  Sometimes you got a cell phone. 
[01:23:00]  It works real good.  That means there's a tower nearby.  If you got a tower nearby, that's a good thing.  And when there's no tower nearby, it's a bad thing.  And good things, as we know, are better than bad things.  Bad things aren't as good as good things.  Sometimes there's a good thing that can be a bad thing for somebody else, and that's not the best kind of thing for that person.  But at least it's good for you.  And when it's good for you and it's not good for them, there's good and bad.  And there's the Garden of Eden. 
[01:23:30]  And, you know, that's the Bible.  You probably read about that there.  And he made what shaped the forbidden fruit there.  And, hey.  Bravo, Frank.  Hey, Frank, thank you.  All right, I'll leave you guys alone.  Yeah, come see you soon, all right?  All right, we'll talk to you later.  Thanks, guys.  Bye, Frank.  Bye, Caliendo.  Man.  Have a great, man.  Hey, we got to back up a couple jokes.  Jessica's a little bummed.  She thinks the femur broken bone thing should be more than a ten. 
[01:24:00]  A ten's the mostest.  She's looking too into your bit.  Jessica.  This time goes to 11.  Hey.  Hi, Jessica.  Femur, you said you'd rate it a ten.  No, much more than that, my friend.  More than a ten.  Much, much more than a ten.  This is like that Spinal Tap episode.  Yeah.  A ten is the most.  Well, why don't you just make it more?  No, it's above the most.  You broke your femur, obviously.  Yeah, I split it in half and popped it out of my leg.  Nice.  Oh.  Okay, so that pain is 11.  11, 11, 11, of course. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, I slipped the car.  I'm damn proud of myself.  All right, Jessica.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Bye-bye.  That's a big bonus nap.  Yeah, that's the biggest one.  Yeah.  Lexi.  Hey, Lexi.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, oh, my God.  Brian, you are killing me.  Listen, we're coming.  I got about nine people coming to your show later.  All right.  Thank you, Lexi.  And we're going to see you about 10.30.  But before we go, you know, it's daylight and kids are having birthday parties on my street.  And, you know, they sort of wanted some ideas for party games. 
[01:25:00]  And we didn't know what to tell them.  You know, I don't know.  I would think maybe some pin the tail on the donkey.  I think that's a great idea for kids.  Why is that?  Does it make it kind of dangerous, though?  Well, no.  I think, I don't know what people were thinking when they came up with pin the tail on the donkey.  All right, we're going to have a whole bunch of kids over.  We're going to blindfold one.  Give them something sharp.  Spin them around and let them go.  Go, Bobby.  With a pin.  Just run them off. 
[01:25:30]  What are those noises?  Those are puncture wounds, Bobby.  Stop.  We made a horrible error.  Or you could try musical chairs.  There's a nice little anxiety attack for seven-year-olds.  Only one kid can win.  All the other kids are walking around.  Oh, oh, oh.  There's an elbow in other five-year-olds.  How was the party?  It was horrible.  I couldn't get a chair and I got a pin in my neck.  I don't want to go back to that house. 
[01:26:00]  I got a pin in my jugular.  You said that would be a happy house.  You said.  So those are two options.  Yeah.  That was a good setup by Lexi.  Yeah, very good.  Yeah, the softball lob.  The quality setup there, man.  Lexi, we'll see you at the Caroline's side.  Oh, my God.  I guess I could talk.  All right?  All right, we're going to just let her go. 
[01:26:30]  Usually people set stuff up by saying the absolute last part of the joke, you know.  Do the thing where you say jugular vein at the end.  Erected.  That's a surprise.  Do that.  The big yellow ones decide.  At least tonight when you possibly do that, you won't be shocked when everyone starts screaming  and applauding like the first time.  I was so flattered.  Why the hell are they applauding that much at that point?  I didn't realize at the time that you guys just pumped that up, man.  And I certainly appreciate the support. 
[01:27:00]  But I was, like, thrown for a loop.  You know, usually you do it and hopefully you get a little bit of a laugh.  I did it that night.  It was people were, like, yelling, don't make yellow ones decide.  I'm like, what the hell is going on here, man?  The call phrase of the retarded.  It really is.  The joke hit this nerve before in front of a crowd.  Yeah, that was strange.  But people are applauding and clapping.  They had their lighters out like you started a free bird.  Hey, I got a setup for you.  Yeah? 
[01:27:30]  Brian, I recently heard that you're reading it.  I recently heard that you learned to play chess.  Nice setup.  Thank you.  I actually got a talent for that.  I had a radio guy.  I may have told you this before.  I went in there and I had written down some topics.  I said, you know, you can get into them if you want.  If not, that's fine.  He goes, Brian, you wrote down here for me to ask you about dogs. 
[01:28:00]  Why, do you have some good dog jokes?  Oh, do I?  Do I ever?  I'm known for my funny dog jokes.  Funny dog joke number one.  Now, just sit back and be entertained by my dog jokes.  Sit back and enjoy my dog jokes.  But, you know, it's funny you mention this thing about chess, Opie, because I just had a hunch, you know. 
[01:28:30]  I have been playing chess.  You know, the thing that's weird about it, it doesn't end right.  It doesn't end like there's no finality to it.  You know, you're just looking at the board and your opponent goes, checkmate.  And you're like, my king is still there.  And he's like, yeah, but no matter what you do in the next move, I take the king and the following move.  So it's a checkmate.  And he's in the car heading home.  Northern game lets you do that.  You know, you never see a quarterback come up to the line.  Touchdown!  The way your safeties are playing, we'll do a slam pass underneath the coverage.  Too much of a cushion. 
[01:29:00]  Six points.  Touchdown.  Hey, why don't you score the touchdown, man?  And then you get warned, which is, you don't see that in anything else either.  In chess, before you ever get checkmated, you know, your opponent just goes, check, check.  I'm sorry, what?  What did she say?  You're in check.  You're in trouble.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  I wasn't aware, but now I am.  You don't see that in foot.  You don't see the linebackers, you know, just talking to the quarterback.  In fact, hey, we're blitzing. 
[01:29:30]  What?  He's doing a safety blitzing back in there.  I'm sneaking in right here between the center and the guard.  Oh, okay.  Hey, block him.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Linebacker.  I had no idea.  One of the only jokes where I whisper.  I go from screaming jugular to whispering linebacker. 
[01:30:00]  Get a pin in my jugular.  Thank you, Mr. Linebacker.  Now, man, it's going to go.  Would you just pick on it on a volume level, ho-ho?  Because I'm back here scrambling.  You're all over the place.  I've got a guy locked in a shed.  Uh-oh.  Let's see what's going on with foot.  Foot, what's up?  Yeah.  You're locked in a shed?  Yeah, it's foot from Mizzle.  Listen.  This is foot.  It's windy here.  The wind blew the door shut. 
[01:30:30]  The lights are on the outside.  I'm stuck in the goddamn shed.  Jeez.  You're not stuck.  No, I'm not.  Here, listen.  I'll bang on the door.  Help!  Listen.  Come on, listen.  If Ricky's out there, Ricky, come get me out of the shed in the backyard.  The goddamn wind blew the door shut.  I'm standing here burping the bishop.  It's dark.  It's cold.  I'm in a t-shirt.  It ain't funny.  I guess it's funny, but if you were me, it wouldn't be funny.  What's in the shed?  What's in the shed?  You've got two lawn tractors, a pan head, some rakes, and some other sharp stuff that I 
[01:31:00]  just banged my head on.  Throw some rakes and tools on the floor so we can hear it.  Throw some rakes and tools on the floor?  Yeah, just so I can hear.  Because you're yelling help isn't proof enough.  You're stuck.  What was that?  That's a tobacco, a garden hoe.  Start a hoe.  I'm slapping a hoe around.  Start up the lawnmower.  And then we'll be there.  I can't start up the lawnmower.  I'm in this thing. 
[01:31:30]  I'm going to die from the fuel.  This thing needs a ring job.  It smokes like crazy.  He's quick on his feet.  Watch the F word, my friend.  So you will not start up the lawnmower.  How about just, like, you know, kind of stuff?  How about you guys get me out of here?  You know, if I was ever stuck in a shed, I'd be a little nicer.  I don't think the first thing I would have thought of was to call a radio shed.  Yeah, I'm going to call Opie and Anthony.  You don't think that's a smart idea?  No, of course.  I tried calling three of my friends.  They ain't home yet.  They ain't got cell phones.  They're listening to you.  It was Ricky. 
[01:32:00]  Ricky and Gary.  Come on, man.  It's short.  There's beers in the house.  I just bought a pro pack.  Kick the door open.  No, I ain't kicking the door open.  I just paid two grand for this shed.  Are there windows?  No, there's no windows.  There's little vents that you can't get out of.  Forget it.  Why does it work that you can lock yourself in this shed?  It's a shed, man.  The last is on the outside.  It's windy as hell here.  Didn't you ever have a shed?  Not one that had that kind of a trick coyote from the Roadrunner lock on it. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, it's true.  That's a condescending kind of question.  Like, didn't you ever go to school?  Didn't you ever have a shed?  Have a shed.  Oh, yeah, of course I had a shed.  Well, then you know the latch is on the outside.  There's no latch is on the inside.  Anthony don't know that.  I had a shed.  I grew up with a shed, man.  Yeah, but there's no latch on the inside.  And there's no safety mechanism that would keep you from being locked in?  Uh, Ashley Cade, uh, thanks.  I'm going to go bust a bishop while I'm waiting here.  All right.  We're going to keep you on hold.  Make sure you get out of the shed alive, okay? 
[01:33:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm holding.  There's foot.  He's stuck in a shed somewhere.  All right.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  Brian Regan playing Caroline tonight.  Yes.  And all weekend long.  We're all going.  Um, get your tickets now, okay?  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  107 WWE.  Um, Anthony, Paula Jones in the latest issue of Penthouse Magazine.  Yes.  The December, uh, 2000 issue.  Paula Jones uncovered. 
[01:33:30]  I remember there was a time she said she wouldn't pose, uh, for any of the, uh, men's magazine.  Well, that's true.  And, uh, ooh, hey, dude, what?  What happened?  Don't ruin this.  You're going to ruin it.  Ruin what?  She's on the phone.  Don't ruin it.  Well, a set-up would have been nice before she, uh, did the spread.  What?  Can't speak my mind on the show anymore.  Fine.  Look, you can speak your mind.  Let's, let's maybe start the call.  I don't think we've ever had a call end before it starts. 
[01:34:00]  At least have the people know that we actually do have her on the phone.  All right.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  My God.  All right.  Let's, uh, let's talk to Paula Jones.  How are we going?  Yeah.  By the way, we have a Feel for Meals update as well that we'll do very, very soon.  Well, right now, let's say hi to Paula Jones.  Hello.  Hi.  Wow.  What?  Uh, we're saying hi, and, and I, I waited to hear this voice because I hear you have quite  the, uh, southern twang.  I do. 
[01:34:30]  Yes, I think I do.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a pretty good one.  I thought, I thought we were talking to Paula Jones, not Tammy Faye Baker.  It's Ellie Mae.  It's Ellie Mae.  It's Ellie Mae.  Oh, ma.  Oh, ma.  Oh, ma.  And you can Paula Jones.  Paula Jones.  Wow.  That's a, you know, you guys love it.  That's very cute, that voice.  Are you, uh, following the election results on CNN right now?  Well, I'm not at the very moment, but I have been, uh, 90% of the time.  And, uh, any thoughts that you could share with the New York audience?  Well, I think if it was, uh, George Bush that was not winning at this point in time, 
[01:35:00]  um, I think that it would be the opposite, you know, direction.  I think they would say, if George Bush was trying to, uh, have a re-vote and a re-election  in a certain county or whatever, they would say, oh, he's just a sorry loser, you know,  let it ride like it is, or whatever.  And, of course, um, I think he's just a sorry loser, and I think they're afraid that the  Republicans are going to get a hold of the, um, the White House.  So, so you think, uh, Bush will win? 
[01:35:30]  I hope so.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't think she'd like the Democrats.  Why, why not?  I mean something, what happened?  Well, I mean, I believe in, in, uh, Bush's issues, and I, you know, I agree with them  more than I do with, um, with, uh, Al Gore.  It's a little bit too liberal for me.  You like the Bush.  Huh?  Isn't that funny?  You know, you got, you got to admit, that is kind of funny.  What?  That you're going for Bush.  Uh-huh.  You know?  Why is it funny? 
[01:36:00]  I don't know.  I just wouldn't expect it.  You wouldn't?  No.  Why?  It just sounds funny, you know?  Well.  I don't know.  That's what I'm for.  You know, uh, Opie, I'm sorry.  What were you ready to say?  I was just wondering if people take you seriously with, uh, that voice.  And, uh, that voice is, is, it's weird for New Yorkers to hear.  Yeah.  Well, you know, I was in New York for, you know, a week, a couple weeks ago, and everybody  just loved it.  People said, oh, I just want to hear you talk.  Yeah.  When you pick up the phone, do they say, could you put your mommy on the phone? 
[01:36:30]  Oh, all the time.  They go, uh, can I speak of the lady of the house?  That's what, this is she.  Or, you know, I think your mommy.  It sounds like, uh, you, uh, kidnapped Carrie Strug and brought her down to Arkansas.  Oh, my God.  Where are you calling us from?  I'm from Cabot, Arkansas.  Arkansas.  And you're in Arkansas right now?  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah?  What the hell goes on there?  What kind of, you know, what do you do?  What's a typical day for Paula Jones?  A typical day for me is to get up real early and get my eight-year-old off to school.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  And then, um, me and my other son, who is four, we just see things during the day.  And I'll go maybe a lot during the week and eat lunch with my other son at school.  We'll go eat lunch with him.  And we go to soccer practice through the week.  Yeah.  On the weekends, we go to soccer games and go shopping or go to Chuck E. Cheese and stuff like that.  I live a very normal life, actually.  Get some helium.  Inhale it.  Uh-huh.  Oh, you should hear me on that stuff.  Oh, really?  It's really bad.  No one could hear it.  Just dogs tilt their heads.  Thank you so much, you skanky. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, are y'all making fun of me?  No.  That's Opie.  Okay.  Now, you have your, uh, spread as it is, in penthouse.  Yes.  Now, what possessed you to do this, Paul?  I needed the money, and that's the bottom line figure.  I needed the money.  You know, you've got to give her honesty, because a lot of times, a lot of people come forward  and say, oh, I did it for the artistic thing or the freedom that I did it to do, and, uh,  you know, that isn't it.  Oh, not at all.  You did it for the money.  I didn't listen to my body.  Wasn't there a time that, uh, you said you wouldn't do this, or? 
[01:38:00]  Yes, there was, and I knew it at the time, but after, after my accountant told me what  my taxes were going to be on the Clinton money that I made last year.  Yeah, how much money did you get from Clinton?  $151,000.  You got $151,000?  Uh-huh, and I had to pay taxes on that, and they were due by October of this year.  You had to give it back to the government.  Yeah.  You get it from them, and you got to give it back.  You give it right back to them.  So, now, what was the actual, why?  A gym membership only cost $200.  Why did they pay?  Well, because, I guess, well, he knew he was guilty. 
[01:38:30]  You talking about the settlement?  Yeah.  Well, he was guilty, and he knew that the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals was going to overturn  it and reinstate it back in.  But it was for harassment, right?  Yeah.  It was for harassment because he, uh, propositioned you.  Yeah.  And pulled out his junk, as they say.  Yeah.  Wow.  $29.95.  And did you, uh, did you actually, I heard you had described his, his genitalia?  Uh-huh.  And, uh, and there was something odd about it.  Well, it, it, it was crooked.  It leaned to the left. 
[01:39:00]  It leaned.  It's just a jump to the left.  Yeah.  So, it leaned to the left when it, when it was in an excited state?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, because he was very excited.  Yeah.  He had an erection.  Yeah.  That's like a 50-50 shot, though, because I don't think any guy actually is completely  straight up and down.  Like, it's, it's a little bit to one side or the other.  I said, well, you know what?  I haven't seen that a lot.  So, that's why I, I asked my friend.  You wanna?  I asked my friend right after it happened.  I said, well, look like this.  Is that normal? 
[01:39:30]  Because, I mean, she said, no.  I've never seen that like that before.  But, I mean, I don't know.  There might be a lot of guys that have that.  I don't know.  So, he just like pulled his junk out.  Yeah.  And, and it was excited.  Uh-huh.  And, and what did he say?  He asked me if I would kiss it.  If you would kiss it.  If you would kiss it.  Yes, and he was playing with himself.  He was kind of.  Oh, my God.  Can you believe that?  That is unbelievable.  Right.  Well, but don't y'all, do y'all have any really doubts, though?  I mean, look at what's happened since that time.  Now, you know something? 
[01:40:00]  I honestly, I believe you, man.  Well, thank you.  I'm not telling Clinton.  It's true.  I mean, I think the guy is actually a really nice guy.  He's got sexual problems.  How far did he pull his pants down?  They were all the way down to the floor.  So, you saw everything?  Yeah, from the waist down.  And, and what?  And I was like, I was, I was thinking, this cannot be happening to me.  And.  Did you, did you kiss him?  No.  Oh, okay.  I'm just clearing things up.  Come on, Anthony.  Paul, I'm just clearing things up because a lot of our listeners don't know what happened after that.  Oh, I'm so surprised. 
[01:40:30]  This has been told a hundred times.  I know.  Anthony's just trying to be outrageous.  No, I'm not.  I know.  I'm a responsible journalist that's trying to get to the bottom of the story.  Because a lot of the people where this story appeared weren't reading the papers.  We, our audience is illiterate, 90% of them.  Paul, I'm sorry, Paula.  Did he have old man balls?  Did he have what?  Old man balls.  I don't know.  I wasn't looking that close.  You didn't look to see it?  Because this was something you could tell from a distance, you know, from a few feet away.  I mean, this is something you could see, obviously.  Were they hanging like click-clacks? 
[01:41:00]  I don't have a clue.  I didn't even know this was old.  I don't even know if he had any.  I don't know.  So then...  I really don't.  So then you left the room.  Yeah, because I wasn't down there, you know.  Here's what I did.  I told him, I said, I'm not that kind of girl because it really scared me.  And I was just like, I've got to be going.  I've got to be going because I've got to go.  You know, I'm going to get in trouble.  I'm not that kind of girl.  Well, how about anal?  Well, I said, oh, my gosh.  And at that point in time, he's like, well, he was real embarrassed.  He got real red. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Because I'm probably the first girl to ever turn him down.  You think?  Daniel?  Probably.  And then, so, I told him I need to be going.  He said, well, okay, I don't want to make you do something you don't want to do.  And then, I proceeded to go towards the door, which was my back was facing him.  And he pulled his fence up and followed me up to the door.  And he said, well, if you have any trouble, have your boss call me, you know, immediately.  Any trouble?  And then, as I was going out the door, he helped me to the door for a few moments.  And he said, you're a smart girl.  Keep this between ourselves.  Oh, there you go.  And there's a state trooper sitting right out the door. 
[01:42:00]  It was supposed to escort me back down.  He escorted me up there.  And I just flew by him.  And I was down down in the elevator.  And then what happened?  Did you report it right away?  Well, I told a friend of mine at the desk down there that something had happened.  And I said, he made a pass at me because I was just too scared to tell her right there.  We were still there at the conference.  And then I went straight over and told a friend of mine.  And I told her what it looked like and stuff.  And I said, is that where she said?  Oh, my God.  That's strange, you know, or whatever.  Wow.  Did Clinton have a grower or a shower? 
[01:42:30]  A what?  A grower or a shower, you know?  Yeah.  Was it impressive as far as they go?  No, not really.  No, very average?  Yeah.  Huh.  Very average.  Wow.  Why do all the men want to know what his private parts look like?  Is that the case?  I guess y'all are afraid the president's bigger than y'all are from.  I don't know.  Well, you know.  No, he wasn't at all, you know.  And he's a really tall guy, so I guess people would probably speculate.  Look small. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  And then have you ever, have you spoken to him since?  No.  In any capacity?  No.  No, I see him, you know, face-to-face at the deposition.  Oh, you did?  Uh-huh.  How was that?  It was, he wouldn't hardly even look at you.  Did he show you his junk again?  No.  That would have been funny.  No, it's not a lawyer.  He could have just stood up at the table and looked it out.  No.  All the lawyers were there on both sides of the table.  I don't think he would do that.  Wow.  So then you got the money and they cacked the hell out of it, so you posed in Penthouse. 
[01:43:30]  That's right.  Make a little more cake-age for Penthouse.  Yes.  Well, I mean, I needed to pay my taxes.  I owe like $92,000 in taxes.  Are you happy with the spread?  Yeah, because it's very caseful.  And, you know, if you go a little bit further back in the book, I mean, that's just totally disgusting.  No meat curtains.  Yeah.  Right?  What happened to the past?  Sorry, Paula, that's a very derogatory term for female genitalia that they use a lot.  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  No, no.  No.  No.  But you don't show any of your most intimate of areas. 
[01:44:00]  That's right.  And I didn't want to do any really suggestive poses or anything.  I have two little boys, and I do know that they will find out about it one day.  I'm going to tell them about it one day, but they're too small to understand that right now.  And one day I won't be able to say, look, this is what Mommy did.  And they can look at it and still think that it's okay and it's not something vulgar and nasty.  You better hope they don't find it before you tell them, though.  No, they won't.  Not at my house or not at the friend's home.  They won't.  What's the love life like for you nowadays?  Well, I've been seeing somebody.  You are?  Yeah.  And I just want to keep that private, though, you know. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, sure.  No, that's okay.  It's a country Arkansas boy.  Left or right?  Oh, my goodness.  We're not going to discuss that.  So did you think about doing a sit-up before the spread?  Did I think about doing a what?  What, Opie?  I think Opie now is trying to be outrageous.  You know what I mean?  No, I didn't say anything.  Oh, Opie.  Did I think about doing a what?  Like a sit-up.  What's a sit-up?  I think how old?  Exactly.  How old are you?  Like a what? 
[01:45:00]  Come on, give it to me.  I know it's not proper for a guy to ask, but in a range.  How old a gal are you?  I'm 34.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  She thinks you're in good shape, 34.  I've had two kids.  Two kids.  Yeah.  Paula, we're just experts at the girly magazines, and there was one pose that wasn't quite flattering.  Which one?  Which one is that, Opie?  The one when she's leaning on her side.  Leaning on my side.  There was like, you know, some flab there. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, there's not either.  Oh.  I'm very small.  Maybe it was just the pictures.  Yeah.  If I thought I looked bad, I would have never done them.  Well, I mean, they could have airbrushed a little bit better.  Well, they don't do airbrushing, so.  They don't do airbrushing?  I'm very pleased with it.  You're pleased?  Yeah.  And now you also, you got that nose job, right?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  Yeah.  I remember seeing that, and I heard you got it, and I was waiting for the picture.  Yeah.  And then I saw it, and I was like, oh, wow, that's pretty good.  You know?  Yeah, I'm pleased with it.  I think it's great.  Before that, boy, you went through your whole life with a beak like that, huh? 
[01:46:00]  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  I sure did.  What, did you get made fun of?  They call you names and stuff?  No, no, except for Jay Leno when I filed a lawsuit, yeah.  What did he say?  Oh, God, he said a lot of stuff.  I'm sure y'all have, too.  Uh, no, we didn't spend time on you, really.  Well, if you're going to sit there and talk about my stomach or whatever, I actually have  a flat stomach.  That picture.  That's Opie, Paula.  Let me, I want to distinguish this because I find, I find your pictures very tasteful  and very attractive, and I might, I might whip up a batch for these pics. 
[01:46:30]  Well, I mean, that picture that, that one picture you think he's talking about, I was  so tired.  It was the last of the photo shoot, and I remember because I've already complained about it.  I said, why do y'all think that when I look back?  Oh, see?  No, maybe it's because I look, and I did.  I think I did, too.  But everybody else loved it.  Maybe it was your time of the month or something.  Maybe you're a little bloated there.  Oh, Opie.  I don't know if I wasn't.  That's not appropriate.  I'm just looking at the pictures.  Oh, Opie knows he loves it.  Now, does it, does it, what do you think about the fact that there'll be men doing things 
[01:47:00]  with your pictures?  Well, I don't think they, I think there'll be stuff with the other pictures in there,  not mine.  No, I think, you know, how many people in this room already?  Look, I'm seeing hands going up.  Yeah, people in here have already pleasured themselves to your, your phone.  Well, that's y'all's problem, not mine.  Y'all need to find a girl or something.  Does it turn you on or anything?  Oh, Mom.  Yeah.  No.  Okay, let's go to another subject. 
[01:47:30]  Ah, there you go.  No, you're, you're too, you're too nice.  Yeah, we really wanted to pound you or something, but you sound really nice.  And with that voice, it'd be like, you know, kicking a puppy.  Yeah.  So, we, we thank you very much for, for calling up.  And, uh, you could see, uh, almost all of Paula.  Well, she didn't show the penthouse.  Yeah, well, she, she wanted to, uh.  Well, if you see one, one, I guess you've seen them all so you can just, I guess, imagine.  No, we love looking at the new ones in the magazines.  What kind of, um, hairstyle are you doing? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, that's a good question.  What, what are you sporting?  Do you, do you, uh, cut it in various shapes or anything?  No.  No.  You know, it's just natural?  Um, no.  Uh-uh.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I'm not, I'm not going to talk about it.  You trim it nice and neat.  Yes.  But it's a natural shape.  You don't say that.  Mohawk?  No, no, not Mohawk, Opie.  No?  She doesn't have that.  It's not a stripper, uh.  Triangle?  A stripper hairdo.  Nice little triangle.  It's, from what she said, it sounds like a natural shape.  But, but she keeps it well-groomed. 
[01:48:30]  Right.  There you go.  Well-groomed.  Very nice.  What's next for Paula Jones?  Yeah, what are you doing?  What are you working on?  Hopefully, maybe I'll do a book on the near future.  A book?  Because everybody else has done everything on me.  More paper.  There's about a few billion books done about me, and I haven't got a, I haven't got a book  dealer done yet.  Will you be inaugurating the, uh, the winner of the presidential race?  Will I be inaugurating him?  Yeah.  What does that mean?  I mean, I know what inauguration means, but you tell us if I'm going to be there or what?  Well, will you be doing it?  That would be interesting.  Yeah.  Will you, will you possibly do something with, uh, one of the candidates? 
[01:49:00]  No.  You didn't do anything with Bill Clinton, Opie.  No.  That's harassment.  Is it Opie that keeps talking like that?  Yes.  He is pitiful.  Well, a lot of people mistake, uh, what, what happened to you with the whole Monica Lewinsky  thing.  I thought we were talking to Monica.  Oh, stop it, Opie.  No, I got confused, Paul.  I wonder if he, if he thought, if I knew what I stood up with, I wonder if he, I wonder if  Monica knew what I stood up with.  Well, there you go.  Monica has more flab than you, Paula.  I don't have any flab. 
[01:49:30]  It was just the pose, the position, and the, the way the photography was.  Look at all the other pictures.  Just that one shot of you on your side.  Because I was leaning over and, you know, I got a picture.  Not flattering.  The one boob is like kind of drooping over the other one.  Not flattering.  I was, I was thinking the one with the white on is the one that made me look fat.  I didn't think that one did.  Oh, yeah.  Well, if you thought you looked fat in the picture, couldn't you say, you know, let's,  let's, I don't know, retake it with the winter coat on or something.  Oh, my God. 
[01:50:00]  Anthony.  Yeah.  Help me.  I have to apologize again, Paula, for, for, oh.  No.  You know what?  It doesn't bother me.  I can laugh at myself.  No, Paula.  The fact is that most of these pictures are very nice.  Thank you.  All right.  There you go.  I'm not that much fun, huh?  No, you're, you're fine.  Someone is saying this interview sucks.  Why?  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  What's the matter, man?  Yo, this interview blows.  Why?  You're on with Paula Jones.  Hey, Paula, how you doing? 
[01:50:30]  Who is that?  Your daddy.  Give me a hummer.  No, it's Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  I'm hanging out now.  No, Paula.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Paula?  Paula.  I'm going to take it.  Now, Paula is one of our listeners that was trying to comment on the, uh.  Paula?  I hung up on that rude call.  On the, uh, on the interview.  I'm very sorry.  Look.  He freaked, he freaked out on you.  Yeah, Pete wants to say hi to you.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, Paula?  I really feel bad for what happened to her.  I believe what the president did, uh, when he was the governor.  I believe he did it, but I don't think he did it for a sexual reason. 
[01:51:00]  Why?  I think he did it probably just to shut her up.  Pete?  What?  And it was the only thing you have in his hand.  Can we please just get serious comments only, Paula?  Paula, these guys, we, they, we screened the call, so we're looking at what they have  written and they're lying to our, uh, phone screener.  Yeah.  So, uh.  Like this guy, Jimmy, says he supports you.  Serious.  And what you did for your family and for your kids.  Yeah.  Jimmy, you're on with Paula Jones.  Yeah, listen, uh, I, I gotta tell you, I do feel bad for, uh, Miss Jones and all that, 
[01:51:30]  but, uh, honey, you should have kept your clothes on.  You should have kept your clothes on.  Jimmy.  Yeah, so.  This is very uncomfortable.  We have serious questions only, please, Paula.  Oh, my God.  Paula's nice enough to come on the show.  Opie's being bad enough.  No, I'm not.  And now the callers are being abusive.  Paula?  Uh-huh.  I've had it.  I apologize for Jimmy.  Are you okay?  Who, me?  Yeah, you're fine.  All right.  I'm just thinking they're, they're, they're miserable in their own lives or something. 
[01:52:00]  They can't be happy for somebody else doing something they'd like to be.  All right.  Uh, Orlando.  What's up, Tony?  You're on with Paula Jones.  Paula, does, like, when you smile, does your face hurt from all the plastic surgery, like?  Like, does it stretch?  Like, the pain, you know?  No, it doesn't, because I only had my nose done.  How could that hurt?  Oh, you sure about that?  I'm positive.  You might need to go down and have some of your stuff.  Let me tell you who the doctor is.  He's right there in New York.  You could probably go get some done yourself.  Yeah, right?  No, I'm actually 19, so I don't, I don't need it done.  Oh, you might. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let me get rid of Orlando.  So, uh, there is no way this many people can get through without, uh, some serious questions  or comments.  Uh, Joe, what's going on?  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Okay.  And, Paula, how are you doing?  I'm fine.  All right.  I, I must say that, uh, you know, after the plastic surgery, you, you actually do look  quite good.  Um, you know, forget about looking like Cernod de Bergerac before it.  Um, you look really good now. 
[01:53:00]  I, I just wanted to know, uh, in all seriousness, what it felt like to digest the leaders of the  free world.  She said she didn't kiss it, Joe.  No, she didn't kiss it.  She fucked it!  Oh, Paula, Paula, Paula, Paula, Paula, Paula, you guys did it.  Oh, my God.  She hung up. 
[01:53:30]  Leave it, leave it to the listeners.  Oh, my God.  We were having a great interview with Paula Jones.  I don't even know if that made the radio.  No.  It didn't make the radio?  Who knows?  All right.  Uh, Rick, want to call it back, see how that went?  Um, oh, my God.  Just call it back, see how it went, no?  No, no, no, please.  What?  I can't take this.  I ain't doing that anymore.  We were having such a good, good, good interview.  Right.  Gosh, you stepped into a freaking slow pitch softball, oh, man. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  You ever think about it?  A sit-up?  A sit-up?  What's that?  A sit-up.  Exactly.  Exactly.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027.  W-N-E-W.  212-757-1027.  The O&A Show.  Hey.  Finally, we get to Jackie and the Nice Girl. 
[01:54:30]  Finally.  It's been long enough.  Let's go.  We've got Drew Boogie in the studio, our new friend.  Yeah.  You're making Mike is here.  Big Kevin's here.  You're making Mike.  A hot, wax Shannon is here.  She's got a little present for us.  She's going to bring it in a little while.  But why don't we get to Jackie, the Nice Girl, Anthony?  Yes.  Do you want to, like, set this up really fast?  I think everyone knows what we're talking about, but...  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  Called up yesterday.  We found out she has a nice fetish on the phone.  And our roommate over here was dragging knives across her. 
[01:55:00]  And she was squealing with delight in such a way that I think every radio was tuned in.  And the guys were having problems driving.  The guys really like that.  Oh, no.  Never be sorry about that.  They don't want to crash cars.  No, no.  That was the whole goal.  Yeah.  That is always the goal.  It worked.  Of this show, to get people to crash.  Correct.  So she was cordially invited to come in today and have various knives dragged across her  to see what this is like live.  Yes.  You know?  A fine-looking lady. 
[01:55:30]  Sure.  She's a stripper.  Dancer, huh?  Yes.  You want to plug where you're a dancer?  Yes.  There's a cabaret in Eatontown, New Jersey.  Eatontown.  I'm going to be serious about that.  Yes.  You're going to have a lot of people showing up.  It's right by the Columbus Mall.  It's on Highway 35 North.  It'll be great.  You'll get fans.  They'll follow you to your car at night with knives.  That was wonderful.  Fascinating.  It's great.  All right.  Why don't we get into this, Anthony?  Yes.  Why don't we?  All right.  Now, who do you want to do the knife thing?  You want Rob?  I trust him.  You trust Rob?  Let Rob do it, man. 
[01:56:00]  I think everybody else is going to stab me.  All right.  Rob's got the...  Wow.  Rob's got the Rambo knife that Scott brought in earlier.  And his...  You got the other knife, too?  The bagel knife?  Give me that, Mike.  I've got to move on.  Don't confuse bagel knife with little butter knife.  Bagel knife is big, long, serrated knife you use to cut the bagels in the bagel stores.  You ever see those guys?  You need a machete, man.  All right, Jackie.  A machete.  Yeah.  Really?  Well, in Jamaica, we said machete.  A machete?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That means something else, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  A Jamaican mic, just be quiet.  We got a girl that's stripping.  Yeah, Jamaican mic, what are you going to say to chase her out of here?  Yeah.  Make a slap you and run.  We're just moving from taking it easy to there.  Jackie, you can get more comfortable if you like.  Looks like you have some nice panties under those leather pants.  Jackie's getting naked, Anthony.  I think he's got the field mic.  Jackie, the knife girl, she gets turned on by having knives rubbed all over her body.  Wonderful.  Her roommate, who she's not having sex with. 
[01:57:00]  Not at all.  Rob is going to do the...  As a matter of fact, hi, Rachel.  Ah.  So there's a guy named Rachel involved here.  No, it is what I'm figuring out.  I'm teasing, of course.  All right, so Rob wants to make it perfectly clear that he is not having sex with Jackie, the knife girl.  You know, this moment looks very dangerous.  Look at this.  This looks like the beginning of a snuff film.  Yeah.  It really does.  Rob, can we trust you?  Because that's a Rambo knife. 
[01:57:30]  We're not playing with bagel knives anymore.  Actually, the bagel knife is far better than the Rambo knife anyway.  If you stab and kill her, syndication is put off by, like, what, two months?  That would suck.  Five to ten.  Syndication from the thing, five to ten.  Yeah.  Syndication.  Let me get out of prison.  Don't fall with those knives in there.  Oh, my God.  He almost, like, took her head off.  All right, you got to work the Rambo knife, too.  And where's the Freddy Krueger glove, just for laughing?  Oh, my God.  Look at this.  He's already starting. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, no, Stinky.  Stinky just hit the knife with the mic and all went through her.  Stinky, get near her mouth more.  Yeah.  All right, Rob is working the bagel knife all over her body.  And we had a lot of requests to be completely silent.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you.  That's a great example of what she was talking about.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:58:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't know. 
[01:59:00]  I don't know. 
[01:59:30]  I don't know.  He's picking up the rim all night.  I don't know. 
[02:00:00]  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:00:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:01:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:01:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:02:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:02:30]  I don't know.  You're listening to the sounds of a night thing.  I don't usually hear the sounds of a girl being stroked with a knife. 
[02:03:00]  Watch that nip.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's working.  Oh, my God.  He just plunged the knife into the couch. 
[02:03:30]  That was scary.  He's got the knife down her panties.  Yeah, you could fillet her up real nice. 
[02:04:00]  It'll tenderize him down your goal.  He's going to stand here and watch him cut that thing open and have that little kitten her voice spill out all over the floor.  Sorry.  This isn't a place for common. 
[02:04:30]  Shut up.  Round zero.  This is a turn-on.  Go for her throat.  Oh, you're right, dude. 
[02:05:00]  Hey, I reamed it.  You're rude, dude.  I reamed it.  What a way to end, though.  Bravo!  Let me be the first to say the most erotic thing I've ever seen in my life right there.  Wow.  That was something.  My God.  You've got to be kidding me.  I've got it right.  See?  Yeah.  Get to that mic.  You've got footage, right? 
[02:05:30]  I have tons of footage.  That was some of the steadiest camera work I have ever done.  Soundrymusic.com.  Later on tonight, you'll get to see the video of that.  Wow.  Rob and Jackie.  Holy S.  But you didn't have to have O.J. come in.  I can't possibly compare to O.J.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Now, my knife session didn't last that long.  Wait a minute.  I was in and out.  You've got to come back here for a second.  Yeah.  Look at her body.  Oh, wow.  I saw.  I was right there.  There are knife scratches all over her body. 
[02:06:00]  She's all pink.  No, it's not.  No, it's not like she's pink.  It's like a cat.  You know when you get clawed by a cat?  It's all over her belly, all over her leg.  That's what I was saying when I saw her laying it.  They're like just fine scratches all over her body.  Bravo.  How was that, Jackie?  Very nice.  Very nice?  I don't know what else to say.  That was just amazing.  Anthony.  What do you think?  That was nice.  But where's the guy that brings her sunglasses? 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  Hey.  I reamed it.  Well, you can put your clothes in there.  Anthony.  What?  Anthony, you dick.  Usually I call and break up these bullets, but you dick.  Hey, I reamed you.  I'm just your reference.  I'm sitting here.  I'm spraying Florida, killing Jesse.  Bush wins.  Bush wins.  And OJ shows up.  I was ready to say you're the best, Anthony.  I love you, but you dick.  What did you do?  It was a perfect ending.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right. 
[02:07:00]  We might have an encore before we get out of here, okay?  Yeah.  I don't know if her body can handle it, though.  This is like scratches everywhere.  Hey, do you ever see the movie Seven?  Yes.  What about that contraption that guy was wearing for lust?  Oh, yeah.  It was pretty cool stuff.  You liked that?  The big knife on the strap-on thing, and you just ripped the girl in two?  I wouldn't like dying.  No?  No.  I'd prefer to stay alive.  You think you're not going to like the finale of this show?  All right.  Wow.  Everybody loved that, except Big Cat was a little disappointed. 
[02:07:30]  Big Cat said it was sort of like watching a movie and then walking out on the end.  Because he's used to maybe plunging the knife into a chest or something.  Right there, Ken?  Yeah, that's right.  It was a lot neater than I'm used to.  Yeah, see?  Should we do like a quick encore?  Yeah, quick encore.  What do you guys think?  Quick curtain call.  Have a little left in here or what?  Absolutely.  No problem.  All right.  Are you going to let Shannon do a ton of plus?  I do a little bit. 
[02:08:00]  She knows how to handle the knife.  She knows how to handle the knife.  All right.  All right.  I'll do a topless, okay.  I suggest gloves and a black hat.  Should I move to the couch?  Yeah.  And then give everything to Robert Kardashian.  And then take a plane to Chicago.  That's an OJ, man.  I think Jackie the Knife Girl and Rob are ready.  And Hot Wax Shannon topless.  Can she get in a little better position so when she leans over the camera isn't... 
[02:08:30]  No, not you.  Oh, not you.  No, the one with the fine-looking chest.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Now she's got two knives working her body, Anthony.  Yes.  sí.  No.  Merely.  Oh.  Quacken.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[02:09:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Thank you. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you. 
[02:10:30]  You're an ad.  Everyone's mesmerized.  I can't.  Everyone jumped.  What the hell?  Did we change roles today? 
[02:11:00]  Oh, no. 
[02:11:30]  You guys, let's hear it for Jackie the Night Girl, star of the show, star of the year.  I love it.  People probably have their radios turned up real loud in the car so they can hear it good.  I would bet money that someone got in a fender bender over that.  What a performance, Doc.  What a performance.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Hey, Uncle John, what's going on today? 
[02:12:00]  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Pretty good. We're having fun.  Yeah, it sounds like it.  I don't know if it sounds like anything today, but we're having a good time.  No, it sounds good. Oh, it sounds good, man.  Cool. What's up?  I got home about 3 o'clock last night. I happened to flip on the shopping network.  Yeah.  And our friend was selling his baseball cards, and he's counting his rookie card, Gemman 10.  You know, it's like $1,800. He's like, $5,000 card, people. You've got to buy it. Let me show you. 
[02:12:30]  He's supposed to open a price card, a price guide, and the price guide shows $1,450.  You look like a deer caught in a headlight.  Oh, no, really?  Oh, man, it was hysterical. He's like, well, it should be a $5,000 card.  Because he didn't know what to do. He really got caught bad.  So we scream and yell that it's $5,000, but the guidebook is saying $1,400.  Oh, it was hysterical. Exactly.  That's funny.  It was funny. It really was. He didn't know what to do.  Yeah, we saw him the other day.  Yeah, I didn't know if he was going to answer or go blind, man. It was so funny.  Trying to sell that goddamn rookie card, that Tiger Woods rookie card again. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  And they bill it as, they say it's a $20,000 card because they were selling it for $20,000 two weeks ago.  Now it was $5,000.  You're getting a $20,000 card.  A $20,000 card.  A $20,000 card for $2,000.  $2,000. 
[02:13:30]  But the thing is, he was selling it for $20.  Like, I can say my bell is worth $20,000.  Here, $5,000 is yours.  But it's a $20,000 bell.  No, but your bell is famous.  Well, this might be worth $20,000.  Anthony's bell.  $20,000.  The day you would come.  I'll sell it to you for a goddamn nickel.  Last week, we were selling it for children. 
[02:14:00]  You had to send in one of your kids for this card.  Today, screw it, nickel.  Look at those phones, people.  Look at the phones.  Oh, you can't see them.  Good, because they're not ringing.  The goddamn thing's never ringing.  You ever hear one goddamn ring here?  They're not ringing.  Tiger Woods.  Rookie card.  Unbelievable, people. 
[02:14:30]  Why aren't the goddamn phones ringing?  We were selling this for $20,000.  $20,000.  Gem in 10.  Gem in 10.  Gem in 10.  What the hell does that even mean?  I say it every day.  I don't know what the hell it means.  Gem in 11.  It's got to be better than 10.  Sounds better.  It's one more better. 
[02:15:00]  But of that, Rip.  Be dialing.  Be dialing.  Be dialing.  Don, if I could say one thing.  Shut up!  You're always trying to interrupt me when I'm selling my cards.  Selling my cards.  Don, I just want...  Why do you keep doing this?  I'm trying to sell these lousy Tiger Woods runchy cards. 
[02:15:30]  And you're not leaving me alone.  You're not leaving me alone.  You're not leaving me...  Don, the goddamn studio's on fire.  I'm trying to tell you to get out.  Fire sale, people.  Be dialing.  Phones are melting as we speak.  Give me three minutes on the clock.  Three minutes, that'll run into 10, because I can't tell time.  I'm a god-effing moron.  Be dialing.  Ouch, I'm burning.  Stop, drop, and roll, people. 
[02:16:00]  Everyone in the studio.  I'm not leaving.  It's too good a deal.  I don't care if I burn in here.  And I am burning.  The smoke's getting to me.  I'm passing out, people.  But be dialing.  Slightly burned Tiger Woods cards.  Jam, mint, tan, condition.  Ouch.  Take a sip of water.  That's him, though.  That goddamn Tiger Woods card. 
[02:16:30]  Every week now.  It's the new...  Because last year, it was...  Mike McGray!  The Mike McGuire cards.  We got them all.  And I got...  Look, I'll open the pack.  I'll open it.  Oh, my God.  Gold to blooms.  Again, they're pouring out my ass.  I got to go to Vinny real fast.  Vinny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Anthony.  What you were saying, I actually collect baseball cards.  And the guy I use supplies that guy, and he's out of his mind. 
[02:17:00]  He is?  Yeah, he is.  All of a sudden, I mean, I was going to buy stuff.  My supplier was like, listen, don't.  I'll give you half his price.  And that guy, he's out of his mind.  I don't know what he's doing.  But he makes it so compelling that people think they've got to pick up the phone and buy it.  And I looked at him.  That's what it is.  Yeah, he's said it.  He's so convincing.  You'll pay the price.  Exactly.  I mean, I have stuff that he's talking about, and I would want to sell it for what he wants  it for.  I'd be happy to sell it for those prices.  Buy these.  And you feel like you want to pick up the phone.  These are not the droids you're looking for.  These are not the droids you're looking for. 
[02:17:30]  Exactly.  I don't believe anything he sells.  I mean, I...  Move along.  Move along.  These aren't the droids you're looking for.  Buy the Tiger Woods card.  Look.  It's not from my nose.  A booger from my nose on my finger.  I'll wipe it on a Griffey card.  Now it's one of a kind.  Dan West's card.  Rookie card with snot on it.  Wait, I don't even know what card it is.  Oh, it's a Griffey card. 
[02:18:00]  Look, I'm out of my mind.  A Griffey card with your snot on it.  Dan, let me tell you.  These cards have got to be the...  I'll kill you.  Look, I'm spanking one out on a Sosa card.  How much do you think that's worth?  Evil Dan West's seed.  Dan, that alone has to be worth...  F*** you!  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on.  You can't say that.  Dan West just dropped the big F-bomb. 
[02:18:30]  Dan West dropped the big F-bomb.  You can't say that to Wes.  I said F-bomb.  You feel out.  You have lost your F-bomb.  You're sweating like a pig.  You're cursing.  You can't do that, man.  Sometimes you've got to do it just for the replay.  Because Rick will put the goddamn B-bomb.  It'll be funny as a mother F.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:00]  Holy ass.  Everyone's eyes bug out of their head.  I don't think I ever yelled that that loud.  They heard it on hold.  Hey, Tom, did you hear the F-bomb?  Oh, yeah, I heard it.  That's the best if you're on hold during one of those rants. 
[02:19:30]  What's up, Tom?  My favorite thing about watching him is when they get a new package,  you're sitting there, folks, our next thing coming up is amazing, blah, blah, blah.  Real calm, he goes,  I'm Mark McGuire, a rookie!  Me got so-so!  You're right.  You're right.  He does.  He starts out low at the beginning of every segment.  And have you ever called the show?  No.  I called the show.  I actually was dumb enough to order one of the boot shit packages for $69.95.  And the funny thing is you hear him screaming in the background. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, really?  You can hear him on the phone?  I just laugh on the phone with the operator.  You hear him screaming in the background, talking about the package,  and I don't have to order it.  Who's on the phone?  He's got the phone rag.  Look, it's Tom on the phone.  I better start yelling.  He does.  He starts out low, though.  Because, like, after he gets done with one thing that he's selling,  which is the best thing ever, of course.  The last time we watched, it was, uh, open your own card store.  You can start your own baseball card store with what we're giving you in this package. 
[02:20:30]  In this package!  And then he gets done, and he comes out, and he goes, puts his hands on his hip,  maybe leans against the thing.  What we're going to show you now is probably the best thing we've had on this program.  Probably the best, most exciting cards we've ever had.  Rookie cards, people!  Look at all these cards! 
[02:21:00]  And he just goes out of his bird again.  Hey, Don, if I could get in here a minute, I'd like to talk about the biggest thing in this offer.  I'm going to kill your family!  I'll come over to the house, I swear.  Uh-oh, let me go and get the tape.  I'll break into the house and get the tape, O.J. style.  And we got O.J. cards!  Don, we got a caller.  Yes, Jerry.  Hey, how you doing?  Don, this is Kenny, Don.  I got a lot of house full of these things.  They're waiting to go. 
[02:21:30]  I can't believe how much we're going to do them for.  Jerry, Jerry, shut up and drive into a bridge apartment.  Drive into an apartment!  Drive into an apartment!  What's an apartment?  Kill yourself, Jerry!  I don't believe what we got today!  He never lets the guy get a word in.  I'm sorry, Jimmy, the way to go on, you know.  I got a lot of house full of them.  Okay, Jerry, I'm sorry.  Go ahead, go ahead. 
[02:22:00]  These are the best cards!  The most funnest set you're ever going to get!  Mark my words!  Mark my words on this!  Mark my words!  Don, I got a whole, I got a whole glass of glass.  Could you pull that car into the garage, Jerry, and just get carbon monoxide poisoning?  Because I hate your goddamn gun.  Don, you're not going to believe this, Don, when I got the offer. 
[02:22:30]  Can someone please kill him?  My show!  My show!  My show!  My show!  But Don, I got a lot of Don in the warehouse.  You're forgetting about him.  All right, hang on.  I'm sick of him!  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How's it going?  Hey, we're having fun.  All right.  One night I got home, turned on Don West late at night.  He pours the baseball cards on the ground and starts swimming in them.  I'm dead serious.  I can't make that up. 
[02:23:00]  I'm doing the backstroke!  I'm doing the backstroke!  Who wants the one that got stuck in my butt crack?  It's a brand new Fleer Scratch and Sniff.  Fleer Scratch and Sniff!  Of Don's butt!  Look, I'm doing the dodgy tap!  There's a dodgy tap!  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:23:30]  That doesn't sound so bad.  Booyah!  Sucks, man, from wall to wall.  Booyah!  1027 WNEW.  John Valby in the studio.  Hey!  A couple people just want to say hi real fast.  Kyle, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  How you doing today?  Good.  I've been a fan of Valby for many years, and I never knew his real name.  And until he was on your show the last time, I didn't know his name was John Valby.  I knew him was Dr. Dirty.  I wanted to know if he has a tape out.  A CD. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Excuse me, a CD.  When I saw him at Levittown and Governors, one of his guys goes, hey, here's John's latest  stuff.  He dumped literally 30 CDs on my lap.  Did he really?  Oh, yeah.  You got so much stuff out.  Yeah, we got tons of stuff.  Yeah.  Wow.  You can even go on Napster.  Yeah, dude, I got like 50 files off of Napster from him, but I can't find this thing anywhere.  You know what?  You sell them right where I play.  No kidding, huh?  Yeah.  All right, cool.  All right, bro. 
[02:24:30]  Is that too loud?  I can't hear myself too good, but you can hear me, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, yank my doodle, it's a dandy.  Yank my doodle till I die.  Make that wiener shoot some fireworks, just like the Fourth of July.  I've got a Yankee doodle boner.  I've had it since you rough my thigh.  So yank my doodle, if you please.  That bulge is not a phony. 
[02:25:00]  Just stick your fingers up my a**, stroke my macaroni.  Yank my doodle, it's so big.  Baby, it's a dandy.  Stick that sucker in your mouth.  You'll swear it tastes like candy.  Yank my doodle is a dandy.  Yank my doodle till I die.  Put my lizard till it's standing tall.  Right through my f***ing hair.  If you love Yankee doodle packers, I've got one that I can spare. 
[02:25:30]  So yank my doodle till it's pointed toward your boobies.  They say the stuff is beauty cream.  Let's make your boobies pretty.  Yank my doodle, it's so big.  Baby, it's a dandy.  Jerk that turk and make a squirt and keep a Kleenex handy.  Yank my doodle, it's a dandy.  Yank my doodle till I die.  All right. 
[02:26:00]  A little warmer upper.  A little warmer upper.  I think they just burnt out the dump button.  I said boobs instead of the T-word.  Oh, wow.  Thanks for cleaning it up.  That must be it.  Yeah.  I don't think they had a problem with that.  Sick, how many times did they dump out?  They dumped it down to like two seconds.  But he said he cleaned it up.  I did.  I didn't use any of the bad words.  What happened?  What happened?  It's a yank and a doodle dandy. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  It's an all-American song.  How about...  It's degradable  When your mom finds out your girlfriend is inflatable  It's deplorable  But I find her plastic s*** just adorable  I admit it  Oh, her beaver isn't furry like a kitten  Imagine the words 
[02:27:00]  I can f*** her up the s*** without her s***  Like her sister's boobs  You're just inflectable  He knows effing but then he uses the s***  God, God  Well, you know, I knew you were going to bleep one of them  He carefully says effing and then says the s***  Phil from Rocky Point told the dump guy to leave a little song intact  That sounded like a crack addict trying to read the New York Times one ad  Valby rules 
[02:27:30]  They dump six to seven times  Oh, wow  Oh, man  How about...  When I'm feeling blue  When I'm feeling blue  I whip out my magoo  And rub its little head  Till it gets big and red  I tickle the blue vein  That runs along the shaft  Until the head goes  And gives my thumb a bath  Wouldn't you agree 
[02:28:00]  My magoo and me  Have a handy kind of love  Now, that's fun  Now, does that make it?  I don't know  I don't know  But it's like a magoo  What the hell's a magoo?  I don't know  I don't know if that made it  I would love to know what the result is there as far as dumps go  Because a magoo?  Yeah  One dump?  In magoo?  In magoo?  But it's a magoo  Why dump it at all? 
[02:28:30]  He was talking about a magoo  One dump, though  One dump  One dump's not bad  But by a dump, you lose the whole thing  Or just the one word?  You lose four seconds  Four seconds?  That's a lot  Wow, that's a lot  You lose a lot of content  Yeah  That was a good song, the magoo  This skips more than vinyl ever did  I can't wait to hear the bleeped version Saturday  Right  Wow, you know  I thought I had carefully, you know  Picked through these  And used junk whenever I needed to  And used to set up the T word  Well, you can 
[02:29:00]  You didn't use the word junk once yet  Stand up and cheer for girls  To give a s***  Well, bring back your limp junk  Right from the dead  They've got knee pads on their slips  And plenty of chapstick for their lips  Some like the cornhole  Some like the screw  But I like the ones who'll slurp out my goo  Spin or swallow  I don't care  As long as her head is there  At the end of the month 
[02:29:30]  Most girls will agree  It's time for a little tonsil hockey  When you're a big b****  Slap her chin  You'll know that you can't get much more in  You'll stand up and cheer for the girls in this bar  The ones who suck junk  They know who they are  Later on  When we're pumping goo  We'll know who they are too  Oh my God 
[02:30:00]  Are we still on the air?  Why are people running down the hall  Panicking?  Wow  Rick, how many dumps that time?  Wow, it's amazing when you see one of those counters  Just drop to zero consistently  I was about three or four  It wasn't as bad though  I don't know if it's the thoughts you're censoring  It's certainly not the worst  I know  I think we hit a couple bad notes  I think that's what it is  I don't understand  Too descriptive  Too descriptive 
[02:30:30]  Shit and balls  You can say balls  You just can't say what they're doing  Oh  Isn't that stupid?  Let me see  I was out on a date  In my daddy's car  I picked her up  In the New York bar  I finger effed her  The split  She didn't let out a peep  I had my junk  In her throat  Too deep  I was humping her face 
[02:31:00]  My junk started to spit  The doctor said the bitch  Had an epileptic  Well where, oh where  Can my pecker be?  The bitch bit it right off me  Here I stand with two balls and a stump  Please FedEx be my pecker  When you take your neck down  Now that should have made it 
[02:31:30]  Oh no  You know John  You're just not learning  What's up Rick?  Maybe the dump guy was sleeping on that one  Oh yeah?  Or maybe he just ran out of dumps  Nice  Went through  That's good  A lot of that one went through  One maybe two dumps  What do they say on the instant feedback Anthony?  Tell the dump guy to stop  He's causing a rip in the space time continuum  When did hockey become a bad word?  Yeah right 
[02:32:00]  And tonsil  I mean that's  Tonsil hockey  What do you mean?  Yeah  Today's show is going to last an hour and a half  Van Halen on the way  When they finally run out of dump  The guy turns a key  Presses a button  And it goes to a Van Halen CD  Yeah  And we are completely taken off the air when that happens  Larry what's up?  I wanted to get John Bobby to do some St. Paddy's Day  You know any Irish songs?  A-S-S-H-O-L-E 
[02:32:30]  That's how I spell Irish  Ha ha ha  Get a drunk he acts just like a savage  His farts smell like corned beef and cabbage  Ha ha ha  Big red nose  A little green  He'll goose you with the old shillelagh stick  He looks like a boiled potato  But he's really a stewed tomato  That's an Irishman to me  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha 
[02:33:00]  That's probably yeah  Yeah I don't know  Thank you how many times we've done by now  You know  Okay  Do you know what might have been that one?  What?  The word  A-S-S-H-O-L-E  No no  The guy's name  Dick  You know  Oh did I say  When it's used as  A part of anatomy  That's the problem  You could say like  Hey don't be a dick  Yeah  Being used like  You guys being a jerk  You know  I just 
[02:33:30]  I don't care  I mean  I've been doing it for years  Keep playing them  I'm enjoying them  And once  Once we play it on a Saturday  We're going to love it  You know  I got a new limerick  That I really like  See if you like it  While eat  Can you say  While eating a girl from Iraq  Uh yeah  Because you could be  Just  Okay  Maybe you're  It's a cannibalist  Right  While eating a girl  From Iraq  A buzz  Interrupted my snack  Now this is of course  Because you refuse to enforce 
[02:34:00]  The no fly zone  Just south of her crack  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  The old man told your sister  It was pudding  I like that  Wow  I wonder if that one made it through  It was get up until the air  No  That's fine  You think it made it  Yeah  What's wrong with pudding  Your sister's beaver 
[02:34:30]  Has it's own website  Penicillin.com  I don't know  You're doing fine  Alright  John  What's going on  Hey  You know  I called before  But I've been listening to the radio  It sounds like Morse code  Going out over the radio  It don't sound like tunes  Yeah I know  John is learning as he goes here  I think I got an SOS  I think you guys might be sinking  Be careful  I think he got a bit of brain damage 
[02:35:00]  Since the last time he was here  Because last time we got more of his songs  On the radio  Yeah I know  It's taken  What happened John?  Let me try this one and see  There's none of those words in here  So it's got to be good  They're gooey and they're itchy  They make your girlfriend bitchy  They hide right in her stitchy  The herpes family  Yadda la da  Yadda la da  Yadda la da  Yadda la da  Yadda la da  And you can hardly see them 
[02:35:30]  But when you start a  They really make you scream  The herpes family  Da da da da  Yadda la da  Yeah I know  Nothing should have gotten bleeped there  Did that make it?  Did that make it?  That's fine  It made it?  All the way through  All the way through  Yeah a whole song  Yay  A whole song  It made it  The whole way  Wow  I'm so sorry  And last time I was here  I told you  All of these songs that I do  I've done them in Boston  And they haven't bleeped the damn thing 
[02:36:00]  Well that's Boston  Yeah  Yeah  And so you know  They're a lot freer up there  I mean it's  It's the penis  It's the penis  Can you guess?  That's pretty innocent  Yeah  You know let me try this  Now it's just a series of words  And none of them are the bad words  Okay  All right  All right let's try this  Give it a try  Scuzz, buzz, nipple, juice, viagra, swollen, junk  Rump, riding, colon, cowboy, squealing like a chick  Lip, drip, ball, slap, wad, catching, face 
[02:36:30]  New York girls buy their rubbers  Buy the effin' case  I like that  I don't know  At this point  I don't know what made it  I don't even know  What made it on that one  I would say  Yeah that's fine  Yeah  I wouldn't  I wouldn't have dumped one thing  And I didn't  Look  I can't believe  Like some of the stuff  They're dumping out of them  Yeah  Man, neither 
[02:37:00]  Want to try one more there John or what?  Sure  Yeah let me see  I'm uh  Let me  Did you say masturbate?  Ah, that's a new one  That's a new bad word  That's a bad one?  Uh, what's the context?  I could masturbate for hours  Urinate on flowers  Beat it on a rock  It could watch me while I'm shaving  At the girls that would be waving  If I only had a junk  It would jump just like a froggy 
[02:37:30]  Make my blue jeans soggy  Unless I wore a jock  And I swear I'd never eat her  I would always use my beater  If I only had a jump  Picture this  Our legs apart  The fragrance of a tootie fart  We'd bang right on the floor 
[02:38:00]  Then up it popped for more  I would air it out on Sundays  I'd even change my undies  Whack it round the clock  And I would always use a rubber  Whenever I F your mother  If I only had a jump  Nothing quite fit to rhyme  Right  Yeah, it doesn't quite rhyme there 
[02:38:30]  But I think it got through  I hope it got through  Jim, what's up?  What's up, guys?  You guys?  Yeah  This has been the best, funniest song  I ever had to Connecticut  Funniest?  We haven't got any songs on the radio yet  We got pieces of songs  I've seen John many times already  And it's been a blast every time  Alright, Jim, thank you  Thank you, guys  Why don't we take a break  So we can get some more delay  I will build up some delay  John Valby in the studio  This is going to sound great  When we put all the bleeps in it 
[02:39:00]  Oh, yeah  Don't you worry about it  Rick, did that last one make it?  That little cue limerick?  Yeah  It was fabulous  Yeah  You sure?  Instant feedback yet?  Was New York submerged by a tidal wave?  You guys sound like you're underwater  Yeah, that's what happens  When too much delay goes by  Yeah  I think on the last one  He saw it more for what it was  It's art form  And he let it through  Oh, look at that  Art form  My God  John, what's up?  Hey, I think the reason why that tune went through  Was because the dump guy passed out from dehydration and overexhaustion  I don't think he actually found any art in that 
[02:39:30]  I think he's just dead  Very good  You guys suck  Alright  You guys are doing a show for 12 people on hold  Well, yeah  People are requesting they be put on hold  So they can hear John Valby  Yeah  We'll take a break, Anthony  And we'll see where we're at  Right  212-757-1027  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show 
[02:40:00]  Yes  212-757-1027  Anthony  You guys are just as sad as I am  I'm just using the wrong damn word  See, it's all how you lay it out  See, everyone knew what I was talking about  Eat and s***  Come on, you took a bleep on that one  Well, I just dumped myself out  That wasn't me  That wasn't me  I was asking you that time, yeah  Let me try this one, okay  Can't say that  It's a short one  Okay  The room is spinning  We're close to death 
[02:40:30]  The checkout lady  She held her breath  My cheeks came apart  Right there in K-Mart  I cut a cheese bar  The floor was sticky  Out came the waxers  The store detective  Brought out the crackers  I said, gosh, gee whiz  Come get free cheese  Right there in K-Mart 
[02:41:00]  No problem on that one  How about me?  No, I'm George W. Bush  And the economy's falling apart  The stock market's about as healthy  As my vice president's heart  Since I moved to D.C.  Monica's become my latest squeeze  I just hope that cow  Don't give me foot and mouth  I had to get my Monica in there 
[02:41:30]  I love Monica  I'd pop that bitch  I swear to God  They'd pop that bitch  I think you could say that  You know, this one  There's no dirty words  I know it won't get bleeped  But it's really a dirty thought  Okay  Give it a try  You can tell by the smell  That she isn't feeling well  As the end of the month rolls around  You should be a little wary  If she serves a Bloody Mary  As the end of the month rolls around

[02:43:30]  Now that had to make the radio  Of course  It wasn't even talking about anything  I don't know what anyone was talking about  And that's much worse  Than any of the other songs  I know  It just doesn't make sense  Right, John?  I know  I think we ought to have  Some kind of formal protest  To the FCC  It's all in the  I don't want you guys  To lose your job, though  All right  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up?

This guy's the funniest guy I have ever heard in my life!  You've never heard of John Valby?  Yeah, I heard him last time he was on your show, but I've been laughing the whole way home, man!  Ah, cool! 
[02:46:00]  Hey, Johnny D!  Hey, how are ya?  You're the kick, man!  Thank you, sir!  Nice talking to you!  Alright, Rob!  Sean, what's up?  Oh, and A, this guy's a shitty F!  I was in Germany in 1987, and a guy named Dennis Sullivan had a bootleg tape for one of this  guy's club gigs?  Go in!  He was killing us!  Yeah!  He tried to sing a serious song later, and some of the guys were heckling him, he lost  his effing mind!  This is hysterical!  Burn, you're the best, man!  I've been looking for your tapes forever!  I thought I was the only one that heard of you! 
[02:46:30]  Nah, he's got a ton of stuff out there!  John really knows how to play, and, you know, he wishes that people would take him more  seriously, but this is the stuff you're doing here!  I'm telling you, he started, he was trying to cry, he's like, alright, calm down, I'm  going to sing a serious one now, and I started heckling him, he lost his effing mind!  He blasted everybody in the back!  It was hysterical!  Yeah, I would have loved to see that!  I'm going to listen to myself, please!  Alright, buddy.  I would have loved to see that!  Cool.  Okay.  Germany! 
[02:47:00]  You played over there?  No, but I was walking down the street in Germany, I was in an old-timer hockey tournament,  just walking down the street, and some guys came up, Elby!  What the hell are you doing around here?  They were, you know, German soldier guys, you know, just hanging out, it was very strange.  You hear what's going on over there now?  The foot and mouth?  Yeah, and they're mobilizing the German army, for like the first time since Hitler, to protect  the farms, and to guard against this hoof and foot, foot and mouth disease, hoof and 
[02:47:30]  mouth, and so now the German army back at it again.  Wow.  I'm waiting to have them go over and go, we will now protect Poland and France against  hoof and mouth!  Get it, Moose!  It is the Moose, the lousy, dirty Moose we must get rid of.  I am not a Nazi, I am a Swiss, my takers are in order.  It just scares you whenever you see the headline, German army mobilizing.  Oh my God. 
[02:48:00]  Like, oh, here they go again.  I can see how they get in these farms, you know, they put the cows on the trains and  go, it's so weird, they won't even let the humans go out in the country now, in Britain  and stuff, what is that, do the humans get it and just carry it back?  Yeah, you carry it around, so they're thinking of disinfecting people that have been to Europe  and come back so it doesn't get here, but now it's in Argentina, and it's, before you  know it, it'll be here.  They're having these huge barbecues out there, you see, they pile up cows, like a thousand  of them high, and just set them on fire.  Well, that sounds great over there.  Now, maybe you don't know the technical thing, but, okay, so their mouth gets blisters, their 
[02:48:30]  feet get blisters or something, so they're going to die fairly soon.  Can't you just, you know, use them like usual and eat a burger out of them?  That's what they do in White Castle.  They're doing it for years.  That's what the holes in the burger are for, where they cut out the friggin' blisters.  That's disgusting.  I don't know if it's a sponsor, who cares?  I love the White Castle.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, when I was in college, I don't know if Mr. Valby remembers it, 1988 or so, he was 
[02:49:00]  supposed to come up to Binghamton, New York.  There was a protest on campus.  Did he ever make it?  No, I didn't make it.  In fact, I got within about a mile of the campus, and the cops intercepted me and took me to a  little stronghold.  What was the problem?  In two colleges, they passed around lyrics, you know, just taking a racist song out of context  and saying I was a racist, and they didn't want this on campus. 
[02:49:30]  And all these people in pro settings had never heard me.  And you know, when I do races, I do all the races, you know?  Right, yeah.  But they took it out of context, and they had bomb threats, and they had all this kind  of stuff, so the school just gave me the check and sent me home, you know?  Wow, yeah.  Yeah.  Somebody did that.  If they take things out of context, of course.  Oh, yeah.  Which song was it?  It might have been...  Oh, how did this change into an organ?  Wow, yeah.  In the studio.  That's pretty.  Yeah, we're going to have to find how the old one went.  Here.  Anybody know where it was? 
[02:50:00]  Go get Steve.  That ain't good.  That's nice.  Carnival music.  Oh, my God.  Don't play that friggin' music.  I'm going to marry Nikki before I get out of here.  I think in some countries, Rick's already married to her.  Marianne, what's going on?  Hi, Owen A.  How are you?  We're doing great.  I wanted to say hi to John Valvey.  I fell prey to him about seven or eight years ago on Long Island. 
[02:50:30]  I went to Governor's in, I think it was in East Meadow on him, said term.  Never came to mind.  And we were there for the night, and we were getting really loaded, and there was, like,  they coaxed you somehow on stage.  And I got on stage, and there was some girl that kept talking to me, and she's like,  if you do it, I'll do it.  If you do it, I'll do it.  Oh, yeah.  Just thing I know, my friggin' hooters are out, and I'm, like, shaking them all over the  stage.  But I'll be honest with you, at the end of the show, he came up to me, gave me a free  tape, and he signed it and autographed it and wrote, Marianne, you've got the best  piece I've ever seen. 
[02:51:00]  Hey, look at that.  Hey, where did you read that on mine?  Thank you.  Come back out.  You know, we'd like to revisit these things.  Oh, yeah.  We can do that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Are you enjoying him on the radio today?  I sure am.  He's awesome.  He's just, like, he's one in a million.  He's totally great.  Cool.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye.  We want him to do the song that got him kicked out of Binghamton.  Oh, no, I can't do that.  I can't.  I can't.  It'll get me in big trouble. 
[02:51:30]  But how about, oh, he's Sean Puffy Combs.  He'll shoved it behind those bars.  Puff him from daddy's junk like big Cuban cigars.  He lost his junk's playground.  Jennifer Lopez's awesome butt.  So he's hiring Hannibal Lecter to eat the effin' swat.  I don't know if that made him, you know.  Oh, yeah.  We got it.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, his name is Bill Clinton.  He's still sailing in troubled waters.  If the Republicans don't leave him alone, he's going to pop both of Bush's daughters.  So he's pardoned Mark Rich.  Why is that so funny?  His ex-wife's a pretty good hummer.  And, okay, he took the money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, I know I can't do that.  Oh, yeah.  Proving my... 
[02:52:30]  Oh, how are you?  Slow down.  Don't hump too fast.  You gotta make this boner last.  Snap a clothespin' on its head.  Pickle her squat and feel her boobies.  Can you say that?  Sure.  Well, bedpost, do you mind watchin'?  Tomorrow we'll carve another notch in. 
[02:53:00]  But right now, my junk is swollin'.  I'll grab her boobies, pretend I'm bowlin'.  Well, I just want your boobs, forget all the rest.  I've got gobbers of s*** to shoot on your chest.  Oh, my spent pecker looks like a used tuba crest.  God, I love your effin' boobies. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks, but I saw you guys think something was going to get dumped out, right?  Well, one got dumped out.  Yeah, I would think.  One?  One.  One dump.  One dump.  That's not too bad, you know.  No, you're doing much better now.  Thank you.  You know, I think we beat the dump guy into submission.  The C word, I think.  The S word.  Oh, the S-E-M-E-N?  Yeah, that's...  That's usually good if you're talking about naval operations and crews of ships and submarines. 
[02:54:00]  But the second you start talking about it going anywhere, oh, then they got a problem.  Could you say...  Clinically, you could use it.  Could you say your sister thinks s*** is a topping choice?  I don't believe you could say that either, John.  I'm sure that's being snipped down the hall as we speak.  Oh, that's a good one, though.  Yeah, the C-O-M-E word, you know, like come here, when it's used in another context, can't be used at all. 
[02:54:30]  Can't be used at all.  In any way, shape, or form.  So we like to use words like a man chowder, things like that.  Your sister thinks man chowder is a topping choice?  Yeah, but now it sounds like a topping choice.  What's fun about that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're all learning, aren't we?  We are.  Wally, what's up?  Hey, everyone.  How are you doing?  We're hanging with John.  Hey, how are you doing, John?  Good.  How are you doing?  All right.  Yeah, I live at Bayshore, and it's like I listen to you guys every day. 
[02:55:00]  John, I need to know, where can I get some of your music and such?  You guys are cracking me up big time.  I almost slammed on Sunrise Highway into a vehicle.  Oh, beautiful.  You can go to johnvalby.com.  All right.  You can go to laugh.com.  All right.  Or you can come to one of my shows, and I sell them there.  All right.  This guy's pissed off at John.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  This is Valby character, right?  Yeah.  I go to see him a couple years ago.  Never heard of him before.  Brings the house, guy.  He's funny as hell. 
[02:55:30]  But then he gets my girlfriend up on the stage.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  One thing leads to another.  She's got a nice rack, okay?  It's like 36 double D or something.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Take a breath.  Hold on.  You didn't catch yourself.  You said it.  I did?  Don't say the S word.  I'm sorry about that, guys.  All right.  So your girl has a nice can.  Oh, yeah.  She's on the stage.  They're big.  36 double Ds.  Yeah.  And this guy's over there signing them and, like, grabbing them and being John Valby, you  know?  But it's all right.  He gave her a T-shirt, and I'm wearing it now.  Hey, I guess you didn't have too big a problem. 
[02:56:00]  No, no.  It's okay.  It'll work out.  Do you still go out with that girl?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  I'll bring her down on...  Are you doing the Easter one at Club B'nai?  No.  Club B'nai, I think, is out of business.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  What the hell?  So...  What are we, back in the way?  You know, I'm walking around somewhere.  All right.  I'll catch you.  John, you want to leave us with...  She weighs 16...  Oh, I better...  I pulled her pants right down, and what did I get? 
[02:56:30]  A whip of Cape Cod and some underwear sweat.  My knees started buckling, bladder lost control, but my junk stood up like a telephone pole.  I don't know if I can get this right there.  She weighed 16 tons, moved like a house.  Her armpit hair is held a trap for a mouse.  Crabs and her snooty were 80 years old, and the cheese on her snapper was beginning to mow. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  I better stop now.  I got five...  Does that work?  Yeah, we got both of them.  Sure.  Why not?  Hey, thanks a lot for having me here, guys.  I really appreciate it.  I have a good time.  I'm sorry if I messed up by putting that dead air on.  No, it's not dead air.  It's not dead air.  It's just dumped out.  But then we have fun on Saturday replaying it with all the beeps in.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And people know what we were laughing about.  All right. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  Good job.  Wish you to let John go.  John, Val, it's always a pleasure.  Check him out.  And we'll take a break.  The worst of O.J. and Anthony.  1027.  W.N.E.W.  You want to talk about O.J.?  The O.J.?  The O.J.  The O.J. back to the news.  I wonder what this story's about.  Did he do something good for society?  Hmm.  Did O.J. discover a cure for AIDS?  No.  Did he find the killers?  Maybe he found the killers. 
[02:58:00]  No.  Oh, I know what it was.  O.J. contributed a lot of money to a charity.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  He had another fight with his girlfriend that looked just like Nicole Brown Simpson.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, all of his chicks look like that.  He likes the white chicks with the blonde hair.  Well, this is the same girl he's been going out with.  Christy Frotty.  On again, off again.  Relationship.  And just a little background.  Here are some related articles. 
[02:58:30]  You might remember some of these O.J.'s greatest hits.  Of course, killing two people.  Then we have cocaine-fueled O.J. road rage attack.  I love that one.  O.J. in road rage incident.  O.J.'s ex says he broke into her home.  And a girlfriend gives O.J. the boot.  Some of the past things.  Always a problem with the girlfriend.  The latest one, police were called to the South Florida home of O.J. Simpson's girlfriend  Tuesday night after a neighbor reported hearing an altercation break out between the two. 
[02:59:00]  And O.J. gone by the time the cops showed up.  And Christy Frotty explained that her off-again, on-again boyfriend was angry with her for coming home late.  Well, there's a good reason, right?  According to police reports, she agreed to stay at a friend's house for the evening.  Don't go home.  We've seen what happens when you try to go home.  The latest incident, of course, not the first altercation.  They don't even put in the history.  O.J. Simpson, as you might remember, was acquitted for killing.  Because we all know that. 
[02:59:30]  That's a given now.  Yeah, finally we all know.  We got the police report, I think, in.  Yeah.  Want to hear that?  Yeah, this is the police reporting on what happened.  Nothing too thrilling.  Apparently what had occurred was a neighbor had heard some loud argument.  And because of that, the neighbor called the police.  There was no sign of any type of violence or any type of criminal act.  Did you please?  Oh, Psycho Mark.  What the F? 
[03:00:00]  What the hell is Psycho Mark doing?  My God.  I'm Big Jake Black.  No.  It's O.J.  It's O.J.  I was in my rights.  She came home late.  I said 11.  It was 11.01.  And she walked in the door like it was 11.  I almost choked a bitch.  But I didn't know.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm into stabbing the bitch.  The O.J.  This guy will not stay out of trouble.  And mark my words, it might take some time. 
[03:00:30]  But he'll kill again.  It's like Frankenstein.  You know, you can put him in chains or whatever or bolt him to a wall.  But he'll get away and the villagers won't get him with a pitchfork.  Anthony, speaking of O.J.  Yeah.  When we were having those meetings with NBC about the XFL pregame show we're doing.  Yeah.  We suggested to NBC that they bring back O.J.  O.J.  For the XFL on the sidelines.  And the look we got from NBC Sports was quite frightening.  It was the butthead look where he just goes, uh. 
[03:01:00]  It was frightening, yeah.  And they talked about it because NBC used to have the NFL when O.J.  was with him.  And they would talk about things that O.J.  would do.  Like he always got everything wrong.  And beforehand, before the program, they would get everybody's picks, who they thought was  going to win the certain games around the country.  And O.J.  would give his picks.  Like he'd phone them in and say, yeah, I'm looking at the Rams over the Dolphins.  And they'd be like, oh, okay.  So they'd write it down, make a graphic of it. 
[03:01:30]  So when the live broadcast happened on Sunday, they'd go to the various sportscasters and  get their picks.  And then they'd get to O.J.  And they'd have all his picks on the screen.  And all they had to do was kind of read along, I guess.  So it's like, O.J., why don't you give us your picks?  So they'd flash the graphics, Rams over the Dolphins.  And he goes, I like the Redskins.  And he would screw the whole thing up.  So they'd be like, oh, take the traffic down.  And we look like an idiot again.  He changed it every time.  I forgot standing on the sideline with my Bruno Mali shoes and my gloves.  Hey, Vinny wants in on this one, Ed. 
[03:02:00]  Uh-oh.  Vinny!  Vinny the racist, of course.  Anthony, what, are you surprised that this happened?  I mean, here's a guy that was convicted of double murder, basically.  I mean, he cut his wife's head off.  Well, he was not convicted.  The second time?  Oh, in the civil suit.  Yeah.  Well, whatever.  I mean, come on.  This guy lied and said that the pictures that they took weren't of him.  And then all of a sudden, they find out that I think like six pair of Bruno Mali shoes were sold in the whole damn country.  And one of them was him that bought a pair.  And actually, it was his wife that bought the pair. 
[03:02:30]  Not only that.  I mean, come on.  The guy, what a coincidence.  He cut his thumb the same thing that his wife had her head cut off.  Vinny, Vinny.  Come on.  Vinny, I think at this point, even the black people think that O.J. did it.  You know something?  I don't think you're right.  Except we do have one person in the studio that is still convinced O.J. is innocent.  Earl, I never said he was innocent.  He was never convicted.  Right.  Come on, Joe.  No, that's Black Earl.  Hey, wait a minute.  That's Earl.  That's Earl.  Joe, I'm sorry.  I should have known. 
[03:03:00]  Black Earl says he wasn't convicted, so you've got to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Right.  He should have got his job back, though.  Earl, the community, though, does believe that O.J. did it.  Earl, wait.  Did you just hear what he said?  That he should get his job back.  He should have got his job back at NBC.  Well, Earl, you'll be happy to know I've got a surprise announcement right now.  O.J. Simpson doing the Black Rock Coalition show here on WNW.  The show that Earl pitched O.J.  You know, this is the thing.  Like, you know, a lot of these black people out there, like, you know, they know that he did it. 
[03:03:30]  I mean, if they had to swear, who did it?  They'd know he did it.  But the thing is, they just won't say it.  Just say it, Earl.  He won't say it.  I'm convinced he didn't act alone.  But do you know he did it, though, right?  I know.  I told you that.  It was O.N.J.  Two killers I'm looking for.  And Pedro Guerrero.  Hey, Vinny the Racist.  You're a comedian, right?  What?  You know, now that you mention that, I'm trying to become a comedian. 
[03:04:00]  I got some jokes for you.  Some O.J. jokes.  What do you tell a woman with two black eyes?  What?  Nothing.  You told her twice already.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  But let me tell you something.  What's the first thing a woman does when she gets out of a battered woman's clinic?  What, O.J.?  The dishes if she knows what's good for her.  And don't hang out with that coke-snortin' Pedro Guerrero.  There he goes, in my car.  I got to go slit his throat. 
[03:04:30]  911, it's the O.J.  I'm turning myself in.  O.J.  I'm not really a racist.  You could ask anybody, because at home, my TV is colored.  But the thing is...  Oh, Jesus.  But seriously, folks, I'm a regular cutter.  Seriously.  Hey, what would you call Pedro Guerrero if he was in the Flintstones? 
[03:05:00]  What, O.J.?  A stick.  But seriously, folks, did you hear the one about the football player that killed his wife and  her boyfriend?  No, O.J.  Where the hell have you been?  I thought everyone heard that.  That wasn't a joke.  Can I plug my gig? 
[03:05:30]  I'll be it.  Bananas and rascals in Ocean.  The real rascals.  I like to complain about Dice.  He ripped off my buddy, Pedro Guerrero.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  You can incorporate O.J. into your video game.  Let him run around and slash people's throats.  O.J. will just, like, pop out of a room at some point.  That's right.  I don't know.  I don't think O.J. would win against some of the armament that's in this game. 
[03:06:00]  Put me and the knife together with some innocent bystanders, and that's a game.  Got to make the robo O.J.  O.J.  Robo O.J.  Robo O.J.  Robo O.J.  He golfs and kills people while looking for the real killers.  Yes, of course.  People are laughing at me.  The new O.J.  PlayStation 2 game.  Slash and burn.  You're going to love it.  I golf and kill people. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, no.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  What other radio show is going to give you, like, intelligent talk about stock and girls playing What's in My Pants?  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
