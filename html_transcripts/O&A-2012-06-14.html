<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a humorous dissection of Donnie Deutsch's on-air appearance on MSNBC, followed by extensive, often irreverent, reminiscing about their past conflicts with former program director Dave Douglas and attempts by station management, including Bruce Mittman, to mitigate their controversial on-air behavior, such as a proposed pie-throwing stunt and a photo op with sick children. They discussed censorship in broadcasting and their relationships with other station personnel.  This segment also included an analysis of Jim Rome's interview with David Stern, focusing on Stern's response to questions about the rigged 1985 NBA draft lottery, with callers contributing anecdotes about the "frozen envelope" conspiracy theory involving the Knicks and Patrick Ewing.

The show then delved into the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse trial, detailing graphic testimony with vulgar commentary from the hosts.  This was interspersed with discussions about Jim Rome's confrontation with Jim Everett ("Chrissy"), a comedic segment featuring a poorly informed history expert, Rich Voss, a fictional, vulgar space-themed show called "Butt Trek," John Stossel's lawsuit against a wrestler, Madonna's declining relevance, a humorous anecdote from Jimmy, and a difficult phone call with a female listener.  Jim Brewer contributed a bedtime story about cleaning his son's messes.

The Jerry Sandusky discussion continued, with more graphic descriptions of the abuse and dark humor from the hosts.  This segued into a rant against Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed restrictions on sugary drinks, expanding to include popcorn and milkshakes, along with a caller complaining about NYC roads.  A humorous anecdote about an overweight pedicab passenger tipping over, prompting fat jokes fueled by listener-submitted pictures, followed.  The hosts then sampled a Bacon Sunday ice cream sundae, their reactions varying widely.  The segment touched upon various tangents: a listener’s scenario involving Sandusky and guns, the Beach Boys (comparing them to the Beatles and Brian Wilson's struggles), a caller’s Jewish manager, and the movie "Ted." They expressed regret at missing a chance to knock a Whopper from a guest's hand.

The show included the "F.U." segment, featuring angry messages from callers directed at Anthony (for a "strudel" comment), a "side pussy," Chip, Joe DeRosa, and the phone screener.  This led to a discussion of past radio experiences, including song requests and violent listener threats.  The hosts, along with Sam Roberts, then analyzed several 80s music videos, focusing on their perceived "gayness" and using homophobic slurs.  Videos by David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Billy Squire, Wham!, and Dennis DeYoung were discussed, with graphic descriptions and commentary. A caller shared a story about their wife's reaction to a David Lee Roth video.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a Jim Norton promotional video, followed by banter with the intern, Kevin.

A significant portion focused on intern Kevin and his daily 40mg Adderall dosage.  The hosts debated the merits of him going off the medication, particularly on his days off, with input from callers Aaron and Amanda, who shared their experiences with Adderall prescriptions.  Dr. Steve offered a professional opinion on Adderall use and "drug holidays."  The conversation also touched on Kevin's Twitter account (featuring a Hitler mustache) and his marital consummation.  This transitioned to a discussion of the hosts' Burger King bacon sundae breakfast, E-Rock's stomach problems, and a possible gluten intolerance.  The show concluded with a segment about boosting Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe" (she now follows them on Twitter), a parody song about Bobo, and Sam Roberts announcing a DJ gig.  Troy Kwan, the show’s sound designer, was also present in studio.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Donnie Deutsch, he's up on the screen again. 
[00:05:00]  Donnie Deutsch, he sits in on MSNBC on Morning Joe.  And we're obsessed with him because he's just casual, man.  Just a regular guy, just a regular guy, you know, a lot of these guys, they put on a suit and tie and, you know, makeup and hair.  But I just sit myself down.  His hair is a little, a little off, a little must.  His suit has a couple wrinkles in it because he's just getting out of bed and putting a suit on and going to work.  Top button, you know, top button, no tie, no tie, no tie, no tie, no tie, no tie, no tie, no tie, you might get to the tie during the break. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, by the way, yeah, this look took three hours to put together this morning.  Thank you.  I just look so casual.  I hate that look.  The look where you're just making him believe you threw it together.  Donnie Deutsch doesn't throw anything together.  No.  They make fun of him and his clothes.  And what we find hilarious is that he probably gets up at midnight to be at work at four.  Yeah.  Just to get it all together.  Fucking casual.  Look at that. 
[00:06:00]  I'm just a casual guy.  That's a casual guy.  I like clothes, but I don't take it that seriously.  Even his hair.  Oh, of course.  It's that, what do they call it, messy, there's a term for that, messy, I don't know.  Messy.  It's kind of like in shape.  Planned messiness.  Planned messiness, something like that.  Patrice would always call people to scare that.  I knew it was something I knew, yeah.  That's Patrice.  It's like in shape, out of shape guy.  Right.  Or out of shape, in shape guy.  Sure.  It's like, nah, man.  I'm not taking this seriously. 
[00:06:30]  Hey.  Pew, pew.  I know I need a comb.  Maybe I'll comb my hair during the break.  Or maybe I won't.  I'm Donnie Deutsch.  Ah.  He was nice to us.  Yeah, you know.  But you gotta point out this dumb shit.  Of course you do.  He's the only guy on TV without a tie.  Nope.  Doesn't even care.  What's going on with everybody?  How is everyone?  I just told Anthony, we just did this shit.  Yeah, didn't we just do this?  What happened?  We're back again?  What?  Back again.  Yeah.  To entertain the people. 
[00:07:00]  That's how this gig works.  We just keep coming back every morning.  Oh my God.  Fucking groundhog day.  Yeah.  It's a great gig.  I do like the gig, but I told Ed, you know, we used to have naked women and all that stuff  that would just kind of get us through a few days.  All of a sudden it's like, whoa, look what we got today.  Yeah, it was kind of, you know, over the hump.  You know, you'd be like, oh, well, it's the beginning of the week, but at least we got 
[00:07:30]  this happening Wednesday.  Chicks are going to come in and shove a phone up her vagina and we'll see if the signal goes  through it.  Or it's the end of the week, but remember like Wednesday, what happened?  Remember we used to build those Friday shows all week long?  All right, this Friday, we're going to have midgets eating each other's boxes.  Yeah, throughout the week.  We're going to have a guy throw up and we're going to squeeze breast implants.  Book it.  Yeah, it was something to look forward to.  Now we got to look at the news and hope there's something good to talk about. 
[00:08:00]  That's Donnie Deutsch.  And I know people get kind of confused, but it's really, it's not really bitching.  I got to be honest with you, it's not.  We're just showing the people that even a great gig like this becomes mundane after a  while.  It's just like, what?  You know?  Remember the naked daisy chains we used to do?  That would get us through a Thursday.  Oh my goodness.  Right.  And if they had fake IDs, who's looking?  Who's looking? 
[00:08:30]  Bah!  I don't know.  So I'm not bitching.  I really am.  Just showing you that even the greatest job in the world gets to be kind of, I don't  know, just kind of a...  You know, it's just tomorrow rolls around and you just do it all over again.  That's right.  That's pretty much what it is.  Boy, I jetted out past you and what's his name there yesterday?  Who was I talking to yesterday?  I forgot.  I'm serious.  Who was I talking to yesterday? 
[00:09:00]  I guess, you know, what did he rock call him in his text?  Oh, I was talking to Egghead yesterday.  Oh, jeez.  Egghead.  I love how he tries to make believe it doesn't bother him.  Oh, boy.  That's my new favorite thing.  Nah, man.  You know, I'm kind of part of the show now.  It's okay.  I saw him coming down the hall and I'm like, ah, God dang.  Because we were in here discussing an issue after yesterday's show and then I walked out  and Opie was talking to Egghead and Egghead had his phone out. 
[00:09:30]  Was he trying to get your number or something?  No, he doesn't have any of my numbers.  What was going on?  He doesn't have your phone number?  No.  I did that sneak pass thing where I literally put both hands against the wall, looked back  and forth as I sidestepped one way.  I was laughing.  Did you see me laughing out of the corner of my face or whatever?  I saw what you were doing.  I thought it was classic.  No, he doesn't have my number.  The guy who's in charge of the show?  My mom doesn't have my phone numbers and Egghead, they don't. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  You put Egghead in with your mom?  Yeah, pretty much.  Oh.  Do you have Egghead's number?  Maybe she should have my number, but don't.  Do you have Egghead's number under E?  E-H.  Yeah.  E-H.  No, he was showing me some top secret stuff.  Oh.  That'll get the chatter going.  Like what?  Just top secret stuff.  He's like, not for air.  Not for air.  Oh, not for air.  Not for air.  And then I have to decide whether it's for air or not, and I think this one I better  shut my fucking mouth. 
[00:10:30]  Oh.  Not for air, but I want to show you.  What's a hint?  Huh?  What's a hint?  Liberty Mutual t-shirts?  Liberty Mutual.  Liberty Mutual.  Isn't that an insurance company?  It is.  That's why I'm laughing.  Oh, is this the wrong one?  I said the wrong company.  Liberty Media.  Oh.  I like the joke, so.  That is good.  Hey, hey, hey.  No?  No.  It's not for air.  You know what it is.  Yeah?  I want to know so bad.  I do?  Oh, sure.  I'll write it.  All right.  He's going to write it down.  And once again, all this stuff comes out. 
[00:11:00]  It's ugly old memory.  It really does.  It really does.  Let's see.  On.  Oh.  You're not writing down that I only pretended not to know something when I actually did  it.  Ooh.  Okay.  Oh.  Now I know.  Something we might have bitched about two years ago is finally happening.  Oh.  Ooh.  So that's good news.  All right.  Good news for the show.  Hmm.  If we stay. 
[00:11:30]  If we stay, it'll be great news for the show.  It'll be nice.  It'll at least be good till October.  Good for the company.  It's a good positive step for the company.  Not for air.  This isn't for air, guys.  I love that one.  Yeah.  No problem, sir.  You might want to talk to Dave Douglas, because that was the first thing we always talked about.  Guys, I don't want this on the air, but I want to discuss a few things with you.  All right.  The mean name just marched down the hall. 
[00:12:00]  We couldn't wait to turn the mics on.  Record while you talk about this then.  He told you not to, he told you not to bring it out of the air.  Oh, God.  All the time, man.  That was the first thing.  We couldn't wait.  And then he would be so disappointed in us.  We'd always have an excuse.  Remember, he would hide outside the studio because we thought we were safe to go get coffee or something.  And then as soon as we opened the door, he'd like pop his head right in front of us.  Yeah.  He's like, guys, I thought you.  And I would always like, oh, oh, I thought when you said the other thing. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, fuck.  We'd always spit it.  And then he would feel good about himself and go, oh, okay.  It was always something like.  It was an honest mistake and he would walk back to his office.  It was always something like, oh, we thought you meant the next time it happened.  Right.  Because we already did this.  We thought we could talk about it.  Right, right.  But the next time, don't talk about it.  Oh, we're sorry.  How often would he say?  Don't bring this up on the air.  Oh, my God.  There was a period once a week he was begging us to not do something or don't talk about this on the air. 
[00:13:00]  It was the best radio.  For the most part, he felt compelled to not walk in on us during a break.  So we would just keep the break going.  But we'd look out the window and he would just be standing in the hallway.  Waiting.  And we're like, oh, boy, he's not going yet.  All right, keep going.  So we would just babble.  Yeah.  A lot of listeners back then heard a lot of babble because we didn't want to go to break to deal with Dave Douglas.  Dave.  What percentage of the times that he said, don't bring this up on the air, would you bring it up on the air? 
[00:13:30]  I swear to you, probably 100%.  Yeah.  I don't think there was one.  That's great.  No, I don't think there was one where we finally said to ourselves, you know what?  Yeah, maybe we shouldn't.  I don't think there's one.  Every time he thought that he had regained your trust.  Oh, yeah.  And that you guys were both back to being on, like, you know, again.  And then boom, right up his ass.  Just fuck him again.  He would come into the studio and be like, cut.  Oh, no, he wouldn't say goddamn it because I guess his wife would be mad.  But he'd be like, damn it, guys.  Now, what did we talk about? 
[00:14:00]  That's right.  We're like, oh, he gets so mad.  All red face.  Damn it, guys.  Now, what did we just talk about?  He was a good programmer for Lincoln, Nebraska, but he had no business being in the Boston market.  And he had a wife that was very religious.  Maybe Dave was religious, too.  I don't know.  I do know that she had a big influence on the programming of the radio station.  Yep.  We were trying to be a young, edgy rock station.  Yeah.  Didn't we have to – well, they did.  They edited songs way before anybody was editing songs. 
[00:14:30]  Lightning crashes.  Got rid of the abortion thing.  That's the first part about abortion because – rumor has it because of Dave's wife.  It started at the second verse after the placenta falls to the floor.  Oh, they didn't hear placenta hit the floor up there in Boston.  I just thought it was inappropriate.  Right.  Did he really say that?  Oh, yeah, he did.  What a douche.  Oh, yeah, he did.  It was the weirdest thing.  His wife hated us.  BCN made fun of the fact that we were cutting out things of the song and we had no say over it. 
[00:15:00]  We talked about it on the air, though.  Yeah, yeah.  His wife hated us, man.  He did.  So, did she laugh at the show, you think, that she didn't laugh at your show?  Oh, no.  Dave was in a quandary because we were very successful for the radio station he was programming,  but he had to hear it from his wife every night.  Every night.  You hear it?  The guys were doing it, eh?  Yeah.  Naked girls and baked beans, really, Dave?  This is why we moved to Boston?  And then after hearing it from his wife, he goes into work where he thinks he's got some relief  where he can talk to his friends slash coworkers, Opie and Anthony, and every time they just 
[00:15:30]  betray his trust.  Just fuck him over.  And he goes, the best meeting ever was when he literally, my brother says I say literally  too much, so now there's something else you can pick up out there.  Oh, damn it.  Because you have no life for yourself.  I hate when there's a crutch.  It's so hard to break those.  But Dave Douglas sat there one day and told me and Ann, he goes, just, you guys, you  know, just consider me the third member of the Opie and Anthony show.  I remember that one. 
[00:16:00]  So he wanted, he thought logically that the program director being the third member of  a very edgy, you know, we're going to push it as far as we can type radio show, that makes  sense.  He wanted to be involved in everything.  God's honest.  So I technically have Dave Douglas's job.  You got Dave's job.  Oh, he wanted to be me.  Yeah.  He wanted to be involved in all the, all the big ideas and decision making.  Well, because we surprised him on a daily basis and I'm sure Bruce Mittman would have 
[00:16:30]  to like yell and scream at him like, did you know that they were going to do this today?  And Dave had to go, no.  So he was trying to get on our good side and say, look guys, consider me the third member  of the show.  You know, we'll work out some bits and you know, you could.  You could, Bruce, Bruce would be like, uh, Dave, I didn't know they were going to blindside  me with a faggle a bit and I don't need the fagglers getting on my case. 
[00:17:00]  Guys, you got to stop the gay stuff.  Uh, Dave, did you know that they were going to do a bit about shwoogies?  Shwoogies are going to call me and I have to meet with them.  Guys, could you just stop at the African-American stuff?  Yeah.  Oh, Bruce Mittman ruled.  So he was like going to be the third member.  So we would run everything past him.  And we were supposed to be like, that's a great idea.  Yeah.  Because now we have another guy that's going to get his hands in there.  Yeah.  Can you imagine sitting him down and going, hey, so today we're going to have naked girls. 
[00:17:30]  We're not really sure how old they are, but they're going to be completely naked and we're  going to just dump baked beans on them.  Yeah.  Because it sort of has something to do with Boston.  With Boston baked beans.  Right.  So we're just going to throw it on them.  Can you imagine what he would say to that?  I'm the third member.  That's great, guys.  I'll be in.  I remember, I remember we would have lookouts and everything.  Where's Dave?  Oh, yeah.  We have to get the naked girls in.  Yeah, the girl, we were sneaking girls in like they would, Chinese workers coming off  of a fucking, a big crate.  We would sneak everything in we needed for that day's day. 
[00:18:00]  He would come into the studio right before three, like, oh, looks like everything's under  control today.  Everything's on the up and up.  He'd go back down to his hall to program some dumb who gives a fuck music that everyone  has heard a million times thinking that that's important.  And then we would have people coming up the stairwells and everything.  And half the show.  With beer and fucking broads.  Since it was afternoon drive, half the show was done from five to seven where everyone  was gone. 
[00:18:30]  So sometimes we would just play it cool.  Yeah.  Because it was easier that way.  You're right.  Until five when the whole fucking everybody left.  And then all hell broke.  Then the hotline would, then the hotline would ring.  God.  Oh, not God.  Of course.  Damn it, guys.  You know, I know you wait till we all leave.  Oh, Dave.  We just, we, we, I'm sure we told you we were doing this.  No, you didn't.  No, are you sure?  Because me and Opie, both of us remember telling you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You were very preoccupied with something. 
[00:19:00]  Maybe the giveaway or something.  God damn it.  Oh, that's right.  Not God damn it.  Not God.  Damn it, guys.  Damn it, guys.  That's my favorite.  Because it's like, he thinks he's one of the guys, but every time you just go behind his  back and fuck him over again.  Why would the third member every time be like, damn it, guys.  I know we've told these stories a lot, but I love when we pick up on something that  one of us forgot.  I forgot the damn it, guys.  The damn it, guys.  I'm not God damn it, guys.  All mad.  And actually, his face would look more disappointed than mad.  He was so disappointed in us, and he thought we'd look and be like, you know, we disappointed 
[00:19:30]  Dave today, and I don't feel good about myself for it, but we'd love disappointing him.  I loved it.  You know how he punished us.  We would have these big beach parties, huge concerts, where every on-air talent got a  little taste of the stage.  Yeah, a little something.  We would always try to get a bit going.  He would always put us in the shittiest spot.  Yeah.  And we were by far the biggest show on the station.  But, you know, Hillman would get the premier slot. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, Hillman would, and he wasn't doing anything.  And then Ozone would get the real rock spot, you know, the introduction of the big band that  was there.  A lot of times, we got the spot while people were still coming in.  Yeah, people coming in.  Which was ridiculous.  Hillman is still on that same station?  Yeah, because he was like, he's like Wonder Bread.  Everyone likes Wonder Bread.  It's just kind of there, but you're not going to get too excited about it.  You know, he's smart in a way.  He knew how to play the game and survive. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  You know, people aren't around the water cooler talking about Hillman.  No, he's like a cockroach.  He knows how to survive.  He's just kind of there.  He's nice to people.  He does okay radio.  Just okay radio.  Nothing that...  That's crazy.  Yeah.  I can't totally trash the guy.  Did you like him when you were there?  We had an understanding.  Yeah, yeah.  We had an understanding.  You leave us alone, we leave you alone.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  He's the mayor of Mantown.  You gotta...  You know, Mantown.  Yeah, he does the Mantown bits and all that basic shit.  Mantown. 
[00:21:00]  My biggest regret is I didn't tape the Dave Douglas phone calls when he would call during  the show.  Somebody sent me one the other day that, you know, we're going into the gay zone.  Yeah.  Someone sent me that phone call that that's based on.  Wow.  But I don't know where it is now.  We actually had the phone call?  Someone sent it to me.  Damn.  I think we, of course, played the call.  Yeah.  That was the first stage of that whole thing.  Licky, licky, lick, lick.  Whoever that guy was, if you could fucking send it in again, I'd appreciate it. 
[00:21:30]  That would be really nice.  Come on, guy.  I don't know.  I forgot even who it was.  Whoever the guy was.  I remember.  I was like, oh, you have it?  Yeah, we have it.  Oh.  Can we hear this?  I'd love to hear the call.  Yeah, it's two minutes.  All right.  So, I don't even...  Oh, we were talking about that commercial where it's the two guys...  Yeah, yeah.  We did this break the other day, but we didn't have the phone call.  Yeah, and this is typical Dave stuff.  Oh, God.  This would go on constantly.  Dave.  So, Dave calls the hotline while we're playing probably, I don't know, Alice in Chains or 
[00:22:00]  something.  Seven Mary Three.  Seven Mary Three.  And had to kind of give us a little advice about what he just heard on the radio.  But he's helping out as the third member.  This is...  By the way, remember, this call is from the third member of the O.A. show.  So, imagine Jim calling us with something like this.  We haven't had a program director call our hotline since I think Tom Chiasano was the  last.  Yeah.  And here's the funny thing about Tom Chiasano.  He was working for the competition and he called us. 
[00:22:30]  He called us, yeah.  That's how much he liked us and realized no one was supervising us.  So, he called.  Even though it was in his best interest for us to flame out.  And he called the hotline and was like, guys, what the fuck are you doing?  You can't do this on the radio.  Oh, we can't remember that?  Did Dave know you were recording him?  And that you were going to air him?  No, of course not.  After the phone call aired, do you think he went, damn it, they got me again. 
[00:23:00]  Damn it, they got me again.  In his car as he's hearing his phone call.  Damn it, they got me again.  Oh, God.  I thought I had it figured out this time.  Go in and understand it.  He'd never get his brain wrapped around you guys.  I never respected the guy whatsoever.  Is he in a big market now?  No, rumor has it he makes sure all the shopping carts get back in the supermarket.  Oh, really?  There's a rumor.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, he trashed us in an article and stuff too.  But the fact is, I never respected him.  Some of the guys have trashed over the years. 
[00:23:30]  I definitely had some respect for it.  But he had no fucking business being there.  During our time, especially, when we were trying to do something different.  So, Dave, we do this over-the-top, edgy gay bit.  Safe.  FCC safe.  Yeah.  And Dave called to give us a little advice.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I...  Oh, pause.  Here's the other thing I forgot.  Oh, right.  We stopped answering the hotline, which is such a no-no back in the 90s, especially when 
[00:24:00]  you were doing radio.  When you got hotline.  If that hotline rang, it was a known fact on radio.  You picked that up.  Immediately.  And you took your fucking beating.  Yes.  So, we stopped answering.  We're like, fuck, we don't want to deal with this guy.  Yeah.  So, what you're hearing here is, why are you calling on this line?  He was calling on the request line to get a hold of us.  He faked us out.  And I'm being all naive, like, why would you call on the hotline?  But he knows why, because we don't answer the hotline anymore at this point. 
[00:24:30]  He thought he had all your tricks figured out, not realizing you're recording him and  getting ready to air.  That's why we call.  Nah, it started again.  Hello.  Hello.  What's up?  I just wanted to...  Why are you on this line?  Well, I figured it was easier than getting out of my chair and coming down the hall.  Oh.  So, just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show...  Pause that real quick.  Now that you explained that, like, I hate his ham-handed segue. 
[00:25:00]  I hate his wordplay.  Like, hey, it's the request line.  Well, I wanted to make a request.  But it's not going to be a music request.  Right.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Oh, yuck.  He was exhausted from dealing with us.  He's down the hall.  And the reason why he didn't want to come in anymore, because that was even worse.  Yeah.  He figured he was safer through a phone line.  Oh, yeah.  Just wanted to make a request.  Yeah.  Maybe we could steer the show in a little different direction so that this doesn't get out of 
[00:25:30]  hand.  What's getting out of hand?  Well, I think we're going into the gay zone.  And we all know where that leads.  Wouldn't you agree?  Not really, but...  Pokey, pokey in the butt.  No, no.  Licky, licky.  That's fun stuff.  Yeah, it's fun.  But you know what?  It's going to get us in trouble.  Just, you know, steer somewhere else.  If you keep going this direction, it's going to be trouble. 
[00:26:00]  I'm just warning you.  Not from me.  I'm talking about outside.  We've been down this road before.  The old dirt road.  Yeah.  The old dirt road.  Give me a little heads up here.  All right.  Okay.  Go ahead.  See you.  Yeah, he goes, the old dirt road.  We've been down this road before.  I'm like, the old dirt road.  Which, you know, of course, is the asshole.  He's like, yeah, heads up.  Head.  More gay stuff.  Everything that was edgy, it drove him nuts for some reason. 
[00:26:30]  He hated being on the radar.  I think I told a story.  Way before we had any juice, Howard talked about us.  Howard Stern.  And it was a big deal that morning.  Howard thought we were ripping him off.  We did a bit that was similar to his, so he thought we were ripping him off.  Blah, blah, blah.  Okay.  You know, Howard's done that for many years.  So Dave Douglas actually sat us down and said, you know, Howard talked about you guys this morning.  And I, as a radio guy, go, I know.  Isn't that great? 
[00:27:00]  He goes, no, no, we don't want to be on, no, we don't want to be on his radar.  And I looked at him like, what?  We're a nobody's show.  Yeah.  You know, especially back then.  And the big guy is talking about you.  You don't want that?  Why wouldn't you want that?  You could hear in his call there how, like, how scared he was about us talking about anything.  So he would be like, no, not for me.  Look, guys.  Because by this point, we'd beaten him so badly every time he calls that he used to try to be like one of the guys. 
[00:27:30]  Like, hey, I'm just, you know, giving you a heads up here.  I also love that, like, when the managers haven't figured you guys out, like, I could tell in that conversation, if I was on the other end, it was obvious that he was going to be played on the air because of Opie's line of questioning.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, Opie and his leading questions to try to get you to say something stupid because he's recording you because he's going to play it.  Right.  But he had no idea.  But anything edgy, this guy would just fucking want us to steer away from it. 
[00:28:00]  That sounds terrible.  It was unbelievable.  It was crazy.  If Howard talks about you back then, that's a good thing.  Not a bad thing, dummy.  Did you steer away from the gay zone?  I don't remember.  No, I mean, because we did our own thing.  We weren't obsessed with gay bits.  Yeah.  That day we did a gay bit, obviously.  We did have to sit down with the gays.  Yeah, we did.  And they pulled out pamphlets that we had to read.  Yeah.  Told us a cute story about how horrible it is for somebody to have to come out to their parents 
[00:28:30]  and how tragic and traumatic it is a lot of times.  Did you both relate your stories?  Yeah.  But that was all true.  But it was like, yeah, but what does that have to do with humor?  Exactly.  What does that have to do with humor?  We're not being fucking ugly with this whole thing.  We're just, you know, trying to get some jokes out.  We had to read pamphlets and then Bruce behind the scenes were calling them Fagulas.  The Fagulas.  I forgot his exact line. 
[00:29:00]  And Shuggy.  As soon as he left, he goes, you don't have to read those pamphlets, boys.  Now get back on the air and entertain the people.  Okay.  Well, we met with the Fagulas.  Yeah.  So my job's done here.  That was the early days of PC.  It started in the early 90s, but that's when it began to hit.  One thing Bruce told me, he goes, it's going to get worse.  And I never believed him at the time.  I was like, no way.  What PC is going to get?  He goes, it's going to be way worse.  I remember that because I thought he was crazy. 
[00:29:30]  I'm like, no, I think we're in a pretty open society.  And I think it's just going to get better.  People are going to be more understanding.  And man, was he right.  God, he was right at the time.  This is how bad it is.  Last night, I was watching Boys in the Hood on VH1 on HD.  And there's a scene where Lawrence Fishburne is talking to Cuba Gooding Jr.  He plays his father.  And he goes, I hope you're wearing it.  Because he was talking about having kids.  And he goes, yo, what are you talking about having kids for?  I don't want to be a grandfather.  I hope you're using them rubbers.  I got you. 
[00:30:00]  They dubbed the word rubbers with condoms.  They took the word rubbers out of a fucking cable television show.  That's overthinking.  It's terrible.  Now you're dissecting individual words.  They took rubbers out.  That's stupid.  VH1, it just stinks.  Yeah, really.  Yeah.  They were supposed to be kind of edgy and hip.  Holy shit.  I can't imagine being a young person thinking VH1's hip.  No.  No.  I can't imagine that those kids think VH1's hip. 
[00:30:30]  Why?  Because they do fucking Teen Mom or whatever the hell it is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, right.  They do something like that.  Which is way worse.  You can't say rubbers.  That's why it's crazy.  That's way worse than substituting condoms for rubbers, right?  Right.  Yeah, it's way worse to show fucking teenagers having babies out of wedlock.  And this was 1030 at night.  What time did I tweet that?  Like 11 at night maybe?  Yeah.  Should it be 1030?  It just wasn't even the eight.  There's never a reason. 
[00:31:00]  That should be on at noon.  Why would they do it?  That's why it's all just retarded.  It's terrible.  It's ridiculous.  Terrible.  If you're going to take care of that type of thing, then you don't run Teen Mom.  Yeah.  Ugh.  It's ridiculous.  I just want to talk about Dave Douglas now.  Damn it, guys.  I wish we had more phone calls.  Damn it, guys.  I know.  Man.  I wish.  Because it was just, it was all gold from him.  Wow.  Yeah.  He just kept betraying his trust.  Just betraying his trust constantly.  He kind of knew that we blew ourselves up on purpose. 
[00:31:30]  He looked at me and I'm like, what are you going to do, buddy?  Eh.  You didn't take care of us here.  So we had to do our thing.  Was he disappointed?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Was he disappointed?  Mayor's dead.  That's it.  We're gone.  Goodbye.  See you later.  Goodbye.  Oh, he was disappointed.  I saw it in his eyes.  He's like, I know what you just fucking did.  Everyone else around here might not be buying into us.  And you didn't let the third member of the show know.  What happened, guys?  No, fuck no. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Damn it, guys.  Damn it.  Damn it, guys.  Was there a way to salvage the job after that?  Meaning, before he actually canned you or they canned you, in that time, was there anything  you could have done now you look back on it and go?  Of course.  The pie throwing.  Bruce Mittman tried.  Yeah.  He hired a PR firm and everything because Dave hated working with us.  Bruce loved working with us.  That was the weird thing.  But back then, it was still separated where sales try to stay out of programming. 
[00:32:30]  Nowadays, Bruce would have completely taken off or probably would have been in Dave's  face and said, leave these fucking guys alone.  They're doing the job for this radio station.  So we hired a PR firm.  We had a...  We've told these stories, but maybe it's worth telling again.  We actually said no to a picture with sick kids because we're like, no, I'm not saving  my fucking job by you taking a picture of us with sick fucking kids.  At the little kid cancer hospital.  That they were trying to get into the Boston Herald to go see. 
[00:33:00]  We're good guys.  And then Bruce Mittman actually, I swear to you, jumped out of a bush with a cameraman  to shake the mayor's hand.  And they got that in the Boston Herald like, see, everything's okay here.  Yep.  He was trying, Brucey.  You gotta give him that.  Mayor Menino was at some kind of public function, whatever, ribbon cutting thing.  And Bruce blindsided him.  I want to save my meal ticket, my afternoon show.  Like he basically said, hey, Mr. Mayor, and put his hand out. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  And then the photographer took the picture and they got that in the Herald like, you  know, Mayor Menino shakes Bruce Mittman, WAF's GM's hand, you know.  And they were hoping in some way that would help everything.  Mold the picture a little bit differently.  Oh, he totally molded it.  Because then I think he told Mayor Menino who he was exactly.  And of course the mayor was like, Jesus, I just shook your hand.  Fuck you.  But it was too late.  They already had the picture.  The pie throwing thing or the kid's picture, would those have helped?  Well, Dave Douglas, I mean, this tells you all you need to know. 
[00:34:00]  We're in major shit.  And he goes, guys, I got an idea.  Bear with me.  We're going to put you in Faneuil Hall and, you know, in those stocks.  What do they call those things?  Stockades.  Stockades.  Stocks.  It might just be stocks.  I think it's just stocks, right?  Stocks, yeah.  And we're going to allow fans and possibly the mayor himself to throw pies at you.  That's going to take care of it.  The mayor is beyond livid.  Yeah, yeah.  We told everyone he'd die in a car accident.  And this is what's going to take care of the problem.  We're going to have him and listeners throw pies at our face. 
[00:34:30]  Throw pies at us while we color in stocks.  So we're like.  How ridiculous.  We're like, this ain't going to work.  But they already ordered the pies.  Yeah.  They did.  How many was it?  A couple hundred or whatever it was.  A fuckload of pies.  So now they're like, well, fuck.  We got to do something with the pies.  So then they spit it like, why don't we send the pies to the cancer hospital?  The children's cancer hospital.  I forgot the name of it.  I drove by it when I was up in Boston.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  And I went, holy fuck.  That was the place we had to go to.  I forgot the name and everything. 
[00:35:00]  But I just remember as I was driving by.  And it was, I told this story, but it was April.  Yeah, it was April Fool's, right?  Yeah.  And we get in there and we meet all the kids.  They're hobbling out of all these rooms in horrendous shape, some of them.  And they all gather for the big, you know, we're handing over pies.  Some of them couldn't even leave their rooms to see the pies arrive.  It was a big deal.  Well, and then the kids are hanging around singing Christmas songs.  This is a true story.  And one of the people that works there leans over to me and goes, you see Susie over there? 
[00:35:30]  Or whatever her name was.  Oh, yeah.  I go, yeah, yeah.  She's got a nice voice, doesn't she?  They go, yeah, real nice voice.  The lady goes, she's not going to see Christmas this year.  Oh, hey, thanks.  That's great to hear.  Thank you.  Her days were numbered.  I'm like, what the fuck did we just get involved with?  We did a dumb radio bit, and now we're going to try to use sick kids to save our jobs?  To bail us out.  And then I forgot who it was, but I looked right at him.  I'm like, I ain't taking no fucking pictures with these kids where the picture's going to end up in the paper, so we look like good guys. 
[00:36:00]  No fucking way.  I don't blame you.  A bunch of bad kids like that.  No fucking way.  Misbehaving.  I wouldn't even have brought them pie.  Guilt by association.  Absolutely.  Why do you give pie to such bad boys and girls?  Well, I'm like, this is twisted.  I know what we did was twisted, but this is fucked up.  Yeah.  So that's how they try to save our jobs.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  People throw pies at our faces.  Like the mayor was ever going to agree to that.  We knew it was done.  And then he was on TV once, and he was at some location for some shit.  It was Fenway.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  Ask me anything.  I know all this shit.  A reporter asked him about us and stuff, and he goes, well, today's canned day.  Right.  Canned day.  He was so excited, because he got the word from our company.  That we were getting canned.  That they were going to fire us.  And that made him very happy.  Canned day.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  Canned.  We played that clip.  It's out there somewhere.  Canned day.  It's canned day today.  Do you consider the bosses here, like the fourth member of the show now?  No, I mean.  Fourth, fifth, and sixth member.  Yeah.  Definitely.  The one thing they do right is just leave us the fuck alone.  Well, they don't like the abuse.  I mean, there's a lot of stuff we just can't do, but they're not hotlining us and all that  shit after every break. 
[00:37:30]  They don't have much to say about what we do today.  Yeah.  You never hear about it unless the show is.  The only thing Bladder will once in a while say is that the show is particularly filthy.  He says that?  No.  If it's particularly filthy, he'll go, he'll say something like, it was a little dirty.  If it's a really filthy show.  Yeah.  But he never says, you can't do that.  Yeah, no.  He's offering an opinion.  And it's rare.  I'll hear his opinion.  Sometimes I agree.  Sometimes I don't agree.  But he doesn't force it on you. 
[00:38:00]  No.  I like that about it.  Neither does Gary.  None of those guys try to force content.  Oh, God.  They just throw suggestions.  Oh, my God.  No.  I mean, that hotline would ring after every break.  Every break.  Yeah.  And then we moved to N.E.W.  We had Gary Wall, who was cool.  He's indifferent to us.  Remember, we met him on the street.  Yeah.  I go, Gary, what do you think of us after all these years?  He goes, I'm indifferent.  I'm indifferent.  And I laughed at his face.  I'm like, you know what?  I like you, for being honest. 
[00:38:30]  Does he just not like you guys?  Well, he loved us.  And then, I don't know, got a little ugly there.  It did.  We had a few battles with him.  Whose fault was the ugliness?  Yours, or did he do something?  I, to this day, think it was him.  Yeah.  He left us, he would leave for really long lunches while we were taking on the, you know,  the New York radio world.  Yeah.  We kind of needed him in there.  You know, I thought he was pretty talented.  He was trying to do some different shit.  Yeah, he was.  He was definitely, I had his hands tied, though, as far as the company goes. 
[00:39:00]  He really wasn't able to do things.  Is this boring people?  Nah, it's, you know, it's behind the scenes shit.  Is he in the radio business still?  No, I'm curious.  I mean, I'm getting on here.  Gary Wall, I don't think so.  The problem with, um, Ant says his hands were tied.  It was unbelievable.  So, uh, CBS Radio owned K-Rock, so they were doing alternative rock.  And why couldn't we play classic rock again?  Um.  There was a reason we couldn't play classic rock either.  I forgot.  Did they own a classic rock station back then, maybe?  Um, yeah, who was playing classic rock? 
[00:39:30]  There was.  But that was Clear Channel.  No, yeah, but there was somebody, I think it was like, was it, it wasn't CBS, was it?  I don't know, but there's a reason why we could, he wasn't allowed to play classic rock or alternative rock.  So he was finding these weird records that kind of had no place to go.  Wow.  And that's a lot of the stuff they played back then on, um, N.E.W. before they turned it into a talk station.  I hated the music on N.E.W. 
[00:40:00]  Hated it.  Yeah.  When we were there?  I, I, probably long before, too.  I thought it stunk.  Yeah, they were lost.  Fucking, oh, Van Morrison.  Yeah.  Again.  Yeah.  I don't know if they,  Horrid.  Maybe they didn't want to take on, uh, Q104 at the time because they were doing so well with classic rock.  I don't remember.  But I remember his hands were tied and he was just finding these records.  Like, we would play Sheryl Crow.  Think about Sheryl Crow.  Where do you really play her?  Yeah.  She's sort of pop, but she could, she's sort of rock. 
[00:40:30]  She's kind of AC.  You know what I mean?  It's one of those artists that you don't really know what to do with.  Yeah.  She's popular, obviously.  With other artists who get perpetual headaches.  Jeez.  That was his problem because he wanted to just, you know, you know, schedule a music station his way.  But, uh, but, uh, he would have meetings all the time.  You can't play these certain records because K-Rock's playing them.  Green Day and all that shit at the time.  But who cared if K-Rock played them?  Well, they were all by the same company.  Oh, okay, okay, right, right. 
[00:41:00]  But the weird thing is we, we should have just been over there.  We fit with that format perfectly, but.  Isn't it amazing how they fucked up?  When you look back, you're like, oh, God, what dumbbells.  What dumbbells they were to obsess on the playlist.  Yeah.  Like, like, obsess.  Oh, yeah, they would obsess.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  And they just drove people away from it.  Yep.  So, that's interesting.  I have no problems with Gary Wall.  I know we had our issues, but.  Yeah, yeah.  I did, in the end, I really did like the guy.  We were just all in a weird, tough spot.  We had too many fucking, too many hands in the soup, as they say. 
[00:41:30]  And, uh, yeah.  And his daughter, we had a babysit.  We always had a babysit, too.  Yeah.  We had to babysit Bruce Mittman's kids when we were at AF in Boston.  He would drop his kids off in the studio.  Uh, boys, could you watch my children, uh, for a while, and, uh, I'll be back.  And then me and Andrew are looking at each other like, we want to talk about tits and  ass, and we got, like, uh, we got a 12-year-old in the studio.  Yeah, literally kids in the fucking studio.  Remember when that happened?  Like, what the hell are we supposed to do now? 
[00:42:00]  I think that was his way to try to keep us, uh.  Yeah, yeah.  Keep us in control.  Maybe if I put kids in front of him, they'll behave.  Little kids and little...  These morally corrupt assholes.  Maybe this will help.  Yeah.  He was trying everything.  Oh, God.  It might be time for the book.  Little yarmulkes on.  It might be time for the book.  It was a fun, fun time, wasn't it?  And then he, and then there was, and then he had something set up where the mics were 
[00:42:30]  always live, even if we didn't turn them on.  So, on the way home, all he had to do was call a phone number and listen to our conversations  in between breaks.  Yep.  Yeah, the good old days.  Yeah, Jesus.  Then Anthony figured it out with his technical mind there.  And he figured out what the fuck was going on and was able to unplug it every day.  Every day.  We'd go in and the first thing we'd do is open up the phone closet.  The big phone closet.  How did you figure that out?  I don't know.  I don't remember, but I do remember remembering it. 
[00:43:00]  And Bruce Mittman couldn't call us out on it because obviously he would call and he wouldn't  be able to hear us.  Yeah.  But he couldn't come in and go, I know what you guys are doing because he was basically  wiretapping us.  Yeah.  And then we would plug it back in at seven.  So, I'm sure when he checked it, he's like, everything's working.  It works now.  I don't understand what's going on.  Hello, hello.  Works now.  Why does it go out at three, but then starts working again at seven?  Time for Rocco.  I don't get this.  All I get to hear is Rocco eating. 
[00:43:30]  Hello.  I want to hear O&A talking.  Hello.  I want to know what's on their mind.  We just pop the phone cord out.  Boink.  Yeah.  There we go.  You figured it out, though.  That was brilliant.  Fucking brilliant.  Fuck it.  We had to badmouth everybody during commercials.  Man.  Something's never changed.  No kidding.  I'm trying to change that.  Yeah.  I am trying.  Yeah.  A little stroll down memory lane.  When you guys were on WJFK, what about that, Alex? 
[00:44:00]  Alex.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, Alex.  When you guys were on WJFK for a minute before, you know, that whole thing went down with the  Whip Them Out Wednesdays and the thing in...  Yes, we know what you mean.  The church thing.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  Those were the good old days.  At least WJFK had some good radio on.  Now it's all crap.  What is it?  It's all talk now, right?  I think they're doing sports, right?  Oh, sports?  Yeah.  All they do is sports.  You have a dude like Lamar Arrington trying to talk sports. 
[00:44:30]  Think he's an expert.  Well, sports...  And the other guys...  FM Sports Talk is the hottest format in America right now.  It's everywhere.  It's fucking everywhere.  I listen to you guys every day, so I don't really listen to a direstial radio, so I like  to call it now.  All right, sir.  I appreciate it.  Some old fans from the JFK days.  Speaking of sports radio, did you hear David Stern and Jim Rome going at it?  Oh, God.  I heard that.  Yeah.  I haven't heard this clip yet. 
[00:45:00]  By the way, the dumb paper calling him a shock jock.  Who?  Rome?  No, just the thing.  David Stern asks shock jock.  Shock jock.  They're lazy.  They're lazy reporters.  Shock jock.  It was...  Nothing's shocking anymore.  Enough of the shock jock thing.  Jim Rome, I don't really listen to ever, but he impressed me because David Stern seems  like a cranky douche.  Yeah, absolutely.  But Rome seems like he likes to break balls, too.  And they obviously have...  I think the word was...  They've had cantankerous times together. 
[00:45:30]  Cantankerous?  Isn't he in the cantankerous?  Oh, right.  Cantankerous.  No, that's the other one.  Oh, dummy.  A lot of hardcore NBA fans are convinced that lottery gets fixed.  Every year?  I've heard...  I don't know what they were talking about.  There's a lot of people convinced that they fixed that shit, you know, to bring up the  weaker teams so the competition is better.  Oh.  And so this has been one of those conspiracy things forever since Patrick Ewing, I think, 
[00:46:00]  joined the Knicks.  I think.  Someone that knows more about this, please call in.  So Rome asked him about it.  And Rome handled this, by the way.  He's really a good broadcaster.  He's a good...  When you hear the way he handled it, you're like...  I like Rome.  Yeah.  He's like, fuck, man.  He's a pro.  This guy's an unshakable...  I like Rome.  I like Mad Dog.  I don't like Mike Frances at all.  No, he's smart, but he's irritating.  I don't like him at all.  Michael K. I saw at the Yankees game.  No one seems to like me.  Hey, dog.  My droning voice. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, Michael K. was at the Yankee game.  Yeah.  He was good.  There's TV now.  With Jody Applegate.  I don't know if I'm blowing up his spot or not.  Uh-oh.  Not if he was at the game or not.  Yeah, he was right there.  Who's Jody Applegate?  Applegate.  She's been a news broad forever.  News broad.  Me and my brother...  News broad.  Me and my brother, we were howling...  God, why am I doing this?  We were howling because she has the worst ass ever.  Really?  Oh, no.  It is horrendously flat and out of shape.  Because I guess she's been sitting at the news desk for too long. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, man.  And she had panty lines.  And you know when you see panty lines, it's usually a tiny little, holy fuck, piece of nothing.  But you have big bloomers, huh?  Big bloomers with the panty lines popping through.  We were howling.  I think we missed two innings of the game.  Applegate's his wife?  Oh, they're married?  I don't know.  That seems to be what somebody says.  But, you know, Pal Talk, as far as yesterday goes, eh, they just lied to me.  Well, I don't...  Make me look like an idiot.  I don't get out enough. 
[00:47:30]  It's my problem.  Don't get out enough.  I don't get out enough.  If they're married, okay.  Yeah.  Here I'm thinking they got a big scoop.  They've been married.  They'll probably have kids together.  I don't know.  But, I mean, she's beautiful.  Yeah.  She's got a really nice face.  She's got some implants now, I believe.  Everything looks nice from here up.  Yeah.  But that ass is where it is.  And you've concluded it's from sitting at the news desk?  Yes.  I like it.  Guys are hilarious.  Yeah, it's from sitting at that news desk.  I know. 
[00:48:00]  I know this shit.  Yeah.  She's beautiful, though.  She really is.  But my point is nothing.  Jim Rome talking to David Stern yesterday.  If you haven't heard this, the fucking Twitterverse, as they like to call it, went nuts on this clip.  Oh, the Twitterverse.  We got the longer version, by the way.  Yeah.  So we'll see how much of this we want to play.  You know, New Orleans won the draft lottery, which, of course, produced the usual round of speculation that maybe the lottery was fixed.  I know that you appreciate a good conspiracy theory as much as the next guy was the fix in for the lottery. 
[00:48:30]  You know, before we get into that, that's just a dumb question, in all fairness.  Because David Stern would never admit it if that is the case.  Right.  You know, so it is a loaded question.  You know, I have two answers for that.  I'll give you the easy one.  No.  And a statement.  Shame on you for asking. 
[00:49:00]  You know, I understand why you would say that to me.  And I want to preface it by saying it respectfully.  I think it's my job to ask, because I think people wonder.  No, it's ridiculous.  But that's okay.  I know that you think it's ridiculous, but I don't think the question is ridiculous.  Because I know people think that.  I'm not saying that I do, but I think it's my job to ask you that.  Have you stopped beating your wife yet?  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, I don't know if that's fair.  I don't know if that's fair.  That's fair.  Why is that?  Because I think that there are, and I know you read your emails. 
[00:49:30]  You know, I think that is fair.  Isn't that the old, you know, you answer a loaded question with a loaded question?  You and Colin are both got it.  What?  Motherfucker.  I didn't see that.  That's exactly what that was.  He doesn't beat his wife.  You're right.  He doesn't.  But it puts him in a spot like, well, answer that one.  Oh, man.  Yeah, no, that's a famous tactic.  If you get a loaded question, you throw a loaded question back.  I never knew that.  You didn't know that?  No.  And I was talking to Colin.  Oh, God.  It's been part of my repertoire for my entire life. 
[00:50:00]  But I mean, you saw that immediately, and Colin saw it.  We were talking about it last night.  And he goes, well, it could have been like that old thing where you're like, did you?  I'm like, what?  Shut up, you idiot.  But then I realized, oh, he's right.  Yeah, there's nothing to Jim Rohn beating his wife.  Right.  But it puts him in a spot.  Like, Jim Rohn put him in a weird spot, because he's not going to answer that question.  Like, holy fuck, you got me.  After all these years, I guess I'll announce on your show, the NBA lottery is fixed.  There's no good answer to the question.  There's none.  So that's the way you get out of it. 
[00:50:30]  So for Rohn to go, oh, that's not fair.  Yeah, it is.  Because you know what you were doing.  Right?  Yeah.  Your wife yet?  Yeah, I don't know if that's fair.  I don't know if that's fair.  Why is that?  Because I think that there are, and I know you read your emails, and I'm sure you follow  things virally and on Twitter.  People really do think it, whether it's fair or not.  Which is true.  Well, they think it because people are few.  You don't think the question's fair to ask if your fans think it?  Silly questions.  I expect it to be written about, and you know, I actually, I... 
[00:51:00]  I just want to stop.  It is a silly question.  There is probably another way to do that.  Maybe.  You know, say, look, conspiracies, theorists have it that this thing is fixed.  I mean, you know, you want to explain that?  And then he would explain how the whole NBA lottery works, and the odds, and this and  that, and give some insight on it.  That was a chance for David Stern.  It was such a loaded question.  That was a chance for David Stern to explain it really well.  Like, you know, you ask that, but what a dumb thought that is. 
[00:51:30]  And then go on to explain, this is what it is.  How could anybody think anything different?  Like, there's such a way to have...  That was almost...  It's almost a softball, too.  Is it fixed?  Yeah.  No!  Like, you could go anywhere with that.  I think Rome should have phrased it, you know, better.  Right.  He's better than that.  But, I mean, you got this great clip that isn't going to hurt his program.  Silly questions.  Sometimes I expect it to be written about, and, you know, I actually, I commented last  night at my presser that there was one guy who I won't dignify by naming.  He says, I have no reason to know anything, and I don't know anything, but I tell you I 
[00:52:00]  believe it's fixed.  Okay, that's good.  Why is that?  Well, because this team won it, and if that team won it, it would have been fixed also.  And if that team won it, it would have been fixed also.  And if every team was invited to have a representative there, and if there were four members of the  media there, and if Ernst & Young certified it, you still think, yes.  So, I guess...  I think two things.  Let me...  Which response to this?  I think two things.  Number one, I don't think so. 
[00:52:30]  I don't think so.  I'm not covering myself.  I don't think so.  But I think by asking the question, it would not suggest that I think so.  But the one thing I would say, the league does own the team, does it not?  Yes.  Does that not make the question fair?  I don't think so.  Number one, we sold it.  We're going to close this week.  We already have a...  Is this boring, or should we continue?  No, yeah, it's interesting.  It's...  I mean, you know how the lottery works?  Basically, you know, if you're a real shitty team, you've got more balls in the lottery. 
[00:53:00]  So, like, Miami...  I don't know exactly how many, you know, balls for each team, but...  So, you have more...  Basically, so you do have more chances if you're a shitty team, that your number's going  to pop up.  What was the thing about a temperature of an envelope years ago?  So, they mentioned that the temperature of one of the envelopes...  Oh, yeah.  There's pictures about that.  I don't know what that means, though.  I don't know...  I'm not familiar with it.  I'm sure 50 listeners will know what it is, but I don't know what that means.  It must have been something that felt fixed because of the temperature of an envelope.  Right.  Wow, that's weird.  And what I mean by...  Something about an envelope?  The temperature of an envelope? 
[00:53:30]  What I mean by numbers...  Your logo pops up, by the way, because now people are like, they don't do it with numbers.  And this guy's same room was charged with beating his wife.  See, I've heard that he wasn't.  I read that he wasn't.  That's what I read, too.  Paul?  Hey.  Yes, he was, in fact, charged.  The cops did come to his house.  They did come over and try to attempt to press charges, but his wife, after taking it over,  decided not to, but it was a big group of brief.  Big grou-ha about that for a small time. 
[00:54:00]  Grou-ha.  All right, so that's...  Oh, was it...  Can we Google that, Sam?  So, then David Stern was taking a pretty good shot there, then.  I don't know the data.  Because Colin thought the same thing you did.  That would be more than a loaded question, if that's actual dirt.  Loaded question, usually, is just you throw something out there like, really?  But Rome just said, I don't think that's fair.  Right.  He handled it pretty professionally.  This guy can answer the temperature question as Sam looks up the Rome thing.  Yeah, something about the envelope.  Tim.  Tim. 
[00:54:30]  Hey, what's going on, boy?  Hi, Tim.  What part of Long Island, by the way?  I am from Belport, the old, mighty, fine Belport, Long Island.  Very, very pleasant area.  I don't know Belport.  Yeah, that's South Shore, right?  Yeah, South Shore.  All right.  What do you got, Tim?  Spicy chicken.  Whole nother world down there.  No kidding.  Back in 85, 84, 85, when Patrick Ewing was coming in at the first draft lottery, the Knicks  were doing really horrible, like now.  And basically, they had envelopes.  And the rumor was, to bring the Knicks back up, they froze the Knicks envelopes. 
[00:55:00]  Every time they would reach in to grab an envelope for what team was going to be selected,  they would know not to grab the Knicks one because it was the coldest out of the bunch.  Oh, that's just a dumb theory.  Okay, I thought, all right, that's just...  Yeah, well, how long have they stayed cold?  Yeah, really?  What, do they got to keep running back and forth at the freezer?  Well, hey, look, I didn't do it.  That's just a rumor, man.  That's what they've always said for years.  There's dry ice in there.  The envelope is smoking.  Yeah.  There's ice cubes.  It's all watery because they put ice cubes in the envelope. 
[00:55:30]  It's bulging.  It's all soggy.  The fucking penguins are standing on it?  Get penguin shit on your fucking envelope.  And, Tim, bite your tongue.  The Knicks did very well this year.  We made the playoffs.  We made the playoffs.  It's a conspiracy against my team.  All right, fair enough.  Thank you, sir.  No problem.  And Ewing turned out to be a bust.  No rings for the Knicks and Patrick Ewing.  I don't think so. 
[00:56:00]  Number one, we sold it.  We're going to close this week.  We already have established our price.  I think that if we had gone to Michael Jordan, which was the next team up with in terms of a high percentage,  there was, oh, David's taking care of his friend Michael.  And if it had gone to Brooklyn, which is going into Barclays Center, it would have been fair to speculate, I suppose,  that we want to take Brooklyn off of the mat.  So there was no winning. 
[00:56:30]  And people write about it.  And it's okay to write about it.  We sort of expect it.  But, you know, that's not a question that I've been asked before by a respectable journalist.  I think I understand why you're frustrated by that.  I think that I understand why that would upset you.  I would hope that you would not hold that against me.  I wouldn't hold it against you.  You know, you and I have been into more contentious discussions than that. 
[00:57:00]  I don't know.  I'd put that one right up there.  Well, you know, it's good copy.  And you do things sometimes for cheap thrills.  I did not do that for a cheap thrill.  That's not what that was.  Well, it sounded like it.  No, not at all.  That's my point.  That's where you and I, that's our point of disconnect.  That was not a cheap thrill.  And I was not throwing anything against the wall.  And I was trying to be as respectful as possible.  I'm just saying that people wonder about that.  And I don't want to ask you a question by, here's what I don't want to do.  I don't want to say, hey, Commissioner, people would say, because I'm going to ask a direct question. 
[00:57:30]  But people did wonder.  But that was not a cheap thrill.  I got no thrill out of that.  It's a cheap trick.  No, flopping is a cheap trick.  No, no.  Flopping.  That's a good line.  These two are going at it.  But listen, you've been successful in making a career of it.  And I keep coming on.  Making a career of what, though?  Commissioner, I take great offense to that.  Making a career of what? 
[00:58:00]  What offense?  Cheap thrills?  Are you taking offense?  I am now.  Now I am.  If you're saying that I've made a career of making cheap thrills.  I'm taking a career of time, you know, taking on the world, and now Jim Rome is pouting?  I love it.  No, I'm not pouting.  I take offense.  There's a difference between pouting and taking offense.  I take offense to that, like you took offense to the question.  What if I said, were you pouting when I asked the question?  You want to hang up on me?  No, I can't hang up on you because I'm running out of time.  I would never hang up on you.  Okay.  Listen, I've got to go call somebody important, like Stephen A. Smith now. 
[00:58:30]  He's up next.  All right, you go make that call, and I'll go talk to somebody else, too, I guess, myself.  All right.  All right, Commissioner.  Have a nice day.  I did not hang up on him.  We are officially out of time.  See, I like the way he handled that.  We'll come back and reset that momentarily.  Stay tuned.  What a pro, man.  Like, I would allow my emotion to get in a way or to be a dick, but he...  Yeah, but that would have been good radio.  Yeah, but that was...  When we sound like assholes, it's good radio for people.  Sometimes, absolutely.  But I was amazed at the way he handled it. 
[00:59:00]  I was like, fuck, I would have been really annoyed at that.  Yeah.  The guy is wrong about the frozen envelope, Jim.  Oh, okay.  Joe in Jersey is very bad.  You mean there's no ice cubes in the envelope?  Of course.  There's no dry ice, Joe.  No ice cubes.  What happened in 1985 was they put envelopes in like this ball that they spun around.  The Knicks envelope was actually...  The first three envelopes were placed in.  The Knicks envelope was thrown in, bounced off the wall. 
[00:59:30]  And when David Stern picked it up, it had indentation in it.  That's the whole conspiracy of Patrick Ewing going to the Knicks was the Knicks envelope  had a dent in it.  It was thrown in.  And David Stern, when he reached it, it's on YouTube, you could actually watch it.  He reaches in and grabs it.  It has a big dent in the corner.  That's the Knicks envelope.  That's how they supposedly fixed the 85 lottery.  Yeah, it's not far-fetched to think that they fixed the lottery.  Think about it.  It's in the NBA's best interest to bring up a team. 
[01:00:00]  Especially the Knicks at the time.  They were horrendous and they needed someone big.  And why not if you're the NBA and you can control some shit, you fix it and you get Patrick  Ewing to the Knicks?  It's good for business.  The years after that, how the lottery was fixed, like Orlando won two picks because they  were a new team.  They got Shaq one year and then the year after that, Chris Webber.  The Nets had one or two picks, number one, because they wanted to be in competition with  the Knicks to be all for the tri-state area. 
[01:00:30]  So the lottery is fixed.  Like LeBron went to Cleveland.  They won the lottery.  I mean, if Michael Jordan won the lottery this year, it wouldn't have been really that  bad because he did have the worst team ever.  They only won nine games.  Oh, I know.  Bobcats were horrendous.  So they would have, you know, it wouldn't have been fixed for them.  It would have been fixed more if the Nets won it because they're moving to Brooklyn.  So you can see a little bend in the thing.  In the NBA draft.  Dave DeBusher. 
[01:01:00]  Dave DeBusher.  Knicks legend.  85.  Wow.  Hold on one second, bro.  Sorry.  In the 1985 NBA draft.  Goes to the Indiana.  The horseshoe work.  Wait, what's that?  Football is back in New York City, my friend.  What happened there?  I don't know.  Was that the number two pick?  Indiana.  Indiana. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, that was the number two pick he announced.  That meant the number one was going to the Knicks.  Knicks.  Yeah, number one was going to the Knicks.  If you watched it from the beginning, if you watched that video from the early beginning,  you can see them putting the envelopes in there.  The Knicks one is actually thrown in there.  Hey, Joe, do you know who was the second pick that year?  Rick Smith.  Jesus, really?  He was good, right?  He was all right.  He was all right.  Not Ewing.  Isn't the number two pick usually?  I mean, Ewing, wasn't he a great player?  They just didn't?  Oh, everyone wanted Ewing.  Trust me.  He was the pick that year by far. 
[01:02:00]  Who else was in the top five picks that year?  Any other names we know?  I think Barkley might have been in that draft, too, but I'm not sure.  Who was that guy after that?  So the...  I mean, Wayman Tisdale was in it, but he died.  Right.  Wait, that year he died?  No, he died like the last two years.  Oh.  Yeah, no, he played.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you, Joe.  The temperature.  I love the temperature.  Conspiracy.  There's a conspiracy for everything. 
[01:02:30]  It's ridiculous.  Can I see them putting it in, Sam?  Can you find that?  I want to see them throwing it in.  And I think...  Dropping it.  Wait.  Dropping the envelopes.  No.  That was not thrown in.  Stop it.  Throw it in and it's bent.  What?  First of all, if he was going to throw it in, they would have just bent the envelope before.  Yeah, yeah.  Why would you do it in front of everybody in a glass fucking circle?  Or you would mark it.  Of course you would. 
[01:03:00]  You can mark it in a way no one else would know.  You put a big K on it or something.  Right.  It's pouring a daiquiri over it.  Make it cold.  It's just strawberry daiquiri leaking out the envelope.  It's deliciously cold.  It's deliciously cold.  Yeah.  All right, well.  Remember when Jim Everett attacked Jim Rome.  Yeah, I forgot what that was.  They called him Chrissy.  That annoyed me.  That's right.  Chris, don't you say it again? 
[01:03:30]  Want to eat?  Yeah, let's take us a breather.  Each other's assholes.  All right.  Well, I...  Jesus.  Will I get new golf clubs?  We got the latest on Sandusky, hopefully?  Oh, there's more.  Hmm.  There's a sexy little story.  Is there good stuff today?  No, meaning...  There's good stuff every day.  For us, yes.  For Jerry, no.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, it's...  We already know it's not going to be good for him.  We already know that.  I think we're hoping that some other people maybe get punished through this thing a little 
[01:04:00]  bit.  Sam's got the clip.  The Chris clip.  Hey, you know what?  Let me say one thing.  In that game, how many sacks did I have that we came back and won?  How many sacks did you have?  Yeah, how many game?  How many sacks?  Let's see, but this was back in 1989.  So you have even been Jim Everett back there, but somewhere along the way, Jim, you ceased  being Jim and you became Chris.  Well, let me tell you a little secret.  That, you know, we're sitting here right now, and if you guys want to take a station break,  you can.  But if you call me, Chris Everett, to my face one more time...  I already did it twice.  You better... 
[01:04:30]  You can call one more time, we better take a station break.  Well, it's a five-minute segment.  A five-segment show.  We've got a long way to go.  We do.  We've got a long way to go.  We do.  I'll get a couple segments out of here before.  Well, it's good to be here with you, though.  Well, it's good to see you, too.  You know, because you've been talking like this behind my back for a long time.  But now I said it right here.  Right, exactly.  Well, we've got no problems then.  I think that you probably won't say it again.  I bet I do.  Okay.  Chris?  That's hilarious. 
[01:05:00]  I think that you probably won't say it again.  I bet I do.  Okay.  Chris?  Hey.  Hey, just kidding, man.  Just kidding.  Get him off me!  Get him off me!  Get him off me!  That's not the real audio.  That's not.  No, someone's fucking...  Okay.  No, that's somebody.  No, Rome took it like a man.  I don't know who is more annoying in that clip.  Like, I don't...  Because he's a big fucking douchey jock.  Right, yeah.  Being intimidating.  But then again, guys always do say shit behind your back.  But then again, Rome does say it to him. 
[01:05:30]  But why is he calling him, you see becoming Jim and became Chris?  Like, what does that mean?  Yeah.  Chris Ever.  I know the girl, but...  The tennis player.  Right.  So, that was his little nickname for Jim Everett, because he got soft.  Yeah.  Oh.  Rome thought he got soft.  All right, well, that's a great...  I wonder if they ever met up again after that.  I'm sure they have.  Yeah.  Well, what's their relationship now?  Does anybody know if they ever met again?  No, no.  Did they ever squash that?  Because he didn't punch him.  I think he knocked the table over and grabbed him and kind of pushed him down, but he didn't  fucking pound him.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, he was just scaring the piss out of him, is what he was doing.  Standing over him like that.  He was a big ogre.  Wow.  Yeah, I probably would have fucked him up or something.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, we got to go to break, I think.  He's fine.  Get out of here.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  Doi bu qi.  Wo mi la lu.  Qing ni bang ma.  On Sirius XM.  The History Channel and Jimmy Dean's Sausage Links, with a grant from the Picket Fence Dental  Corporation, present 20th Century American History, with renowned scholar and member of Mensa, 
[01:06:30]  Rich Voss.  I know a lot about it.  Dr. Voss will take you on a breathtaking journey through history's most poignant milestones.  What event took the world to the brink of World War III in 1962?  The Bay of Pigs in Cuba.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, the Russian Missile Crisis.  Oh, my God.  With every outburst, Rich Voss gets dumber and dumber.  In 1962, what almost brought us to World War III?  It had to be the Bay of Pigs in Cuba when... 
[01:07:00]  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  Your head will spin.  What was the U.S. president when World War II ended?  The war ended with the dropping of the atomic bombs.  That didn't actually end World War II.  You've never met a Jew who knows less about World War II than Rich Voss.  What was the World War where Germany was going and taking, you know, just out of control?  By the way, I've never wanted to punch someone more than you.  Are you talking to me?  Yes.  It's pretty embarrassing when you think about it. 
[01:07:30]  So tune in to 20th century American history and watch in amazement as an old Jewish man  goes from mildly coherent to babbling pile of mush in the course of an hour.  You know, you know, it's all history from there.  Coming to the History Channel.  Coming up on the next Butt Trek, the USS Prolapse continues its journey through the universe  in search of giant cocks to fuck.  But the crew members soon find themselves in a compromising position.  Oh my. 
[01:08:00]  Why is there nothing between their legs?  It's silly.  There should be something there.  Why would these people be walking around?  They must be alien race.  Mr. Chekhov is unclipped.  I noticed that at the urinal.  I sure would like to suck it.  Join our heroes as they unravel the mystery of this strange new life form.  They all seem to be lacking something that I enjoy.  Cocks.  And struggle with the dangers of traveling through the universe.  Oh, tell me!  There's a gerbil suck in my hiding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:08:30]  Where did your cock go?  Discover the fate of our fearless heroes.  All on the next Butt Trek.  Power up the ships, Captain!  I'd like a dick in my backside!  Series action.  Series action.  The Opinion 3 Show.  Good morning, sexy! 
[01:09:00]  Good morning.  How was it doing the virus in front of Jimmy Fallon?  It was an honor.  It was an honor.  I liked the Jimmy Fallon interview yesterday.  I thought it was really good.  I like Jimmy Fallon.  Why are they showing the old wrestling clip where Stossel gets choked out by...  Who is that, uh...  Dr. D. David Schultz.  Why is that going down again?  Hmm.  Can we find out?  It's on Fox News.  All right, anyway.  It's E-Rock's turn, anyway. 
[01:09:30]  Stossel's on.  Oh, Stossel's just talking about it?  I guess so.  That was a famous clip where Stossel was trying to see if wrestling was fake or not,  and then he got choked out and thrown to the ground, right?  He must have just won the lawsuit after all that time.  What?  He's been fighting the lawsuit since that happened?  Oh, my God.  It says, hey, because you're involved in a lawsuit.  And I yelled at him, how can you say this without even examining me?  And he backed off.  But sure enough, when I got the settlement, the pain gradually went away.  I think lawsuits prologue pain. 
[01:10:00]  So, wait a minute.  So, are you glad that you filed that lawsuit or not?  Yeah, I think they should be taught a lesson that they can't go having reporters beaten up.  But did you really have $300,000 worth of pain and suffering?  I had two years of real pain.  And, you know, you can determine what that's worth.  Maybe not.  And the lawyer takes $180,000 as his cut.  And I'm criticized as a hypocrite because I criticize this dude.  Is he dead?  Some of them are useful.  Dr. D?  Wow, that second hit was harder than the first.  Oh, so he didn't choke him.  He slapped him pretty hard. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, the choke was Hogan-choked.  Richard Belter, yeah.  Here's the weird thing.  Good.  This happened in 84.  Stossel.  Who was he interviewing again?  David D.  David Schultz.  And basically, what did he say to him?  He said, I think this is phony.  I think this is fake.  And so Dr. D slapped him in his face.  And said, is this fake?  Yeah, knocked him out of the ground.  And slapped him pretty hard.  Twice.  He smacked him hard.  What a jerk off.  Yeah.  The reason why it's in the news today, Stossel finally won the lawsuit.  Did he finally?  No. 
[01:11:00]  That's 28 years ago.  28 years?  That's got to be wrong.  He couldn't have just won.  I think that's why they're doing it.  No.  Find out there, Sam.  God, what a...  This is a classic clip.  Gumbag.  I remember that clip, too.  Classic.  And I hate reporters, but you can't fucking hit a guy.  Right.  E-Rock, why were you playing, what was that, the Peter Gunn theme?  Yeah.  Oh, was it for me?  Double guns?  No.  No. 
[01:11:30]  No, you don't have to do that.  That's fine.  Why is he playing double guns?  E-Rock.  Well, in 1994, Henry Mancini died on this date.  He's dead?  Yep.  Who's Henry Mancini?  Pig Panther theme?  He wrote that.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  He wrote What's Happening...  See, these are things that I don't put on the...  NBC Nightly News.  What's Happening...  Yeah, this is the very famous one.  I want to point out how stupid E-Rock is today. 
[01:12:00]  Why?  Because I didn't play the obvious one.  Whoa!  Yes, though!  Okay, but if I played the obvious one, how stupid is he played the obvious one?  I want everyone to vote.  I want everyone to vote.  Yeah.  Do you do a Peter Gunn song because he died on this date in 1994, or do you just, you know,  give it up to Paul McCartney and play yesterday because it was 47 years ago today?  Or E-Rock could have thought creatively and done some kind of Anthony Racist type bit  because Auschwitz opened their concentration camp 72 years ago. 
[01:12:30]  It's a tough call, but we kill E-Rock if he's too simple, too.  Don't forget, if he goes to the obvious, he does get yelled at.  E-Rock, it's called the Kobayashi Maru.  Yes.  There's no win.  What do you do?  Rescue the ship?  Well, there's another one.  Uh, but you'll be crossing the neutral zone.  Well, there's one that's not on there that if I played, I'm sure Anthony would have got  mad at.  Let's do it.  Well, play it, motherfucker!  Yeah, let's do a few of them.  All right, so you don't go yesterday, I guess?  Eh. 
[01:13:00]  All right.  Nah.  What about the Rangers, though?  Or play scrambled eggs.  Jimmy Fallon was in yesterday.  Yeah, so tired.  Yesterday.  That would have been a clever one.  Yeah, that would have been too clever for you.  He's not a clever guy.  Not at all.  You're really not a clever man.  Well, I apologize for that.  You're a stupid, stupid man.  You are a stupid, stupid man.  What's that called again?  I don't know.  We used to play it.  But it's funny.  A stupid, stupid man.  Nah, you're a stupid, stupid man.  I might confuse people.  I actually like you, Rock.  Do you, though?  I do like you, Rock.  I love how Sam says stuff, and then he looks over at me like, what? 
[01:13:30]  I don't know why they're talking about you like this.  You don't think you, Rock's clever, Sam?  No, generally speaking, I don't.  Sam gets so excited.  He loves this type of shit.  I don't know why they're doing it.  Why didn't you do the Rangers?  First time they won the Stanley Cup in 54 years happened 18 years ago today.  Yeah, when they went to Florida.  Oh, it's a New York thing.  Is this the one for Anthony?  No, this is what they played when they won the Cup.  Oh, okay.  This song's...  Oh, Ricky.  Oh, I think I'm in Japan.  That's the other reason I didn't play it. 
[01:14:00]  Right.  Right.  Is that the best scene for the English office?  It's the best scene from television.  It's fucking great.  That's my number one scene from the English office.  That's probably mine, too.  Then again, it's not my favorite...  No, it's not my favorite scene.  What about the...  There's a rape going on upstairs in a hotel room.  My favorite...  Oh, the play acting.  There's also the dance.  Yeah.  The douche chill moment, though, with that fucking boombox and him needing his music.  That entire episode, though, like when he's in the back afterwards asking where they're  going to go afterwards to get some drinks. 
[01:14:30]  How can anyone think Gervais isn't a genius?  Like, you know, he'll...  You know, it's next stop.  Drunkenness.  That's exactly what a guy said.  Like, it was so perfect.  I'm ready to watch the whole show again.  Dude, that son of a bitch is great.  I love when they turn off the music and he walks back and he's like, don't turn around.  The maid leaning in.  You know what?  That might be my favorite.  Because the first time I saw that, I was curled up in a ball going, oh, God, no.  It's so cringeworthy.  It's really embarrassing.  When he leaves to his music and they go for the reaction shot of the people and they're 
[01:15:00]  just like, what a idiot.  But I just wanted to say to you.  Right.  He's doing that little dance.  And the way he's placed, his t-shirts tucked in.  He waves as he's jogging out the door.  We see him.  I've been David Brett.  You've been the best.  Yeah.  The first time I saw that, it affected me.  Like, it made my stomach hurt.  If you could find that.  It's so embarrassing.  Let's see if it plays well on radio.  Play well for us. 
[01:15:30]  E-Rock.  Kevin from Connecticut reminded me that Henry Mancini also did another song.  Would you like to play it for the people?  Oh.  Wow.  He wrote this.  Yep.  What is this?  Oh, this is the theme song to What's Happening.  Oh, yeah.  What's Happening.  That's what Mabel King was saying to her legs.  Fred Berry's fucking tipping over and dying. 
[01:16:00]  Look, Shirley Hempfell, the waitress, is dead, too.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Jesus.  There's another one, E-Rock.  Oh.  You're missing one.  Another one.  Mm-hmm.  Another one.  What the hell is this one?  Moon River.  Henry Mancini did Moon River.  He wrote this fucking song.  Moon River.  He didn't write Moon River.  He did.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  All right, there's another one. 
[01:16:30]  Hmm.  Uh, oh, he wrote this one.  See, we laugh when it's appropriate, E-Rock.  I just love this song.  I love how people get mad on Twitter and they start going, they write, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, they just go, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  I find it creepy that they figured out how to write it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  We know exactly what they're getting on. 
[01:17:00]  Nope, there's another song, E-Rock.  Another one.  That Henry Mancini did.  Henry Mancini.  Henry, I'm trying to bang this broad.  What's that, Jimmy?  He just ripped one.  Jimmy just ripped one.  No, I didn't.  Are you getting a little excited?  Yes, I am.  Pushing out the excitement.  Yeah, just getting rid of it.  Come on, E.  It's one that's close to your heart.  Yeah.  Oh, I forgot the title of it.  Is there a song called Lard?  Close.  Close.  I'm sorry, Rock. 
[01:17:30]  I didn't mean that.  Close.  It's your theme song.  I know.  I forgot the title of it.  Hang on.  Baby Elephant.  That was him?  Yes.  Miscellaneous.  That fucking guy.  Yeah, he wrote the virus's theme song.  Who's he think he was?  Ah, here it is.  We did that break, right? 
[01:18:00]  Best instrumental song ever?  Yeah.  You went down there, right?  Yeah.  I like hot butter by popcorn or popcorn by hot butter.  Remember that one?  What was that?  The...  Yeah.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  But someone threw it out there and it became a hit.  I know.  This?  This became a fucking hit.  This became a fucking hit. 
[01:18:30]  Why?  Anyway, what were you going to play for Anthony?  Yeah.  You recorded this in 1965.  Today?  Yep.  How do you not like this, Anthony?  Why are people so fixated on what happened today?  Like yesterday was just a day away from...  It just gives you something to talk about 
[01:19:00]  because we can't have naked broads in the studio anymore.  We've got to make some shit up.  I can't believe you don't like this song.  Come on.  That one you have to at least like a little bit.  All right, good.  Talerable.  Talerable?  Talerable.  Speaking of music, Madonna.  I was unaware that she mooned the crowd.  This comes, what, a couple days after she showed her right tit? 
[01:19:30]  Her tit.  I didn't mind the tit.  Tit.  You minded the tit.  No, I was just kind of like, meh, whatever.  Yeah.  It's Madonna.  What's the latest?  Irrelevant.  She mooned the crowd in Rome?  Ooh!  Over Rome, huh?  In Turkey, she flashed her breast last week.  It wasn't enough for the Queen of Pop.  The 53-year-old singer decided to bear even more skin during a live performance in Italy.  Oh.  Never want to cover up.  The material girl stripped off her pinstripe trousers and turned on stage to reveal her black lingerie. 
[01:20:00]  Wow.  And fishnet-clad derriere.  Enough with her.  Ooh!  53-year-old lady, the fishnets!  Vah, vah, voom!  Fuck, enough already.  She's really annoying me lately.  Her fucking Super Bowl performance stunk.  Yeah, I don't like it.  She's doing a horrible job of transitioning her career.  Yes, she is.  She's fighting old ladydom. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  Well, she also had on her back the words, no fear.  Ugh.  See?  Wow, you're brave.  Yeah.  You think Madonna's brave, Jimmy?  Oh!  What a brave lady.  Showing her ass off.  Oh, she's brave.  Oh, God.  She's flashing up.  What a brave lady.  She didn't even really moon.  Oh, it's just a stupid nose.  She had a tee back.  World peace.  Oh, and you know, Madonna, with all due respect, tremendous, iconic performer. 
[01:21:00]  And I know it's hard to see yourself not as relevant.  I mean, and I'm not even shitting on her.  It just happens with age.  You would, though.  I would love to.  And I would take one.  A nice yoga dump.  A yoga dump.  Her latest CD, what, was a bust, so now she's got to do some crazy shit to get people talking.  A total bomb.  She's always been good at getting people to talk.  We're talking about her for the first time in years.  I don't know if that's going to help her CD sales.  No.  We still call them CDs.  What do you call them?  Record sales?  Yeah, record sales. 
[01:21:30]  Help her downloads.  Digital recordings.  Help her digital recordings.  Help her digital recordings.  I don't know.  Gaga.  And she's trying to, like, she's trying to take on Lady Gaga.  She's not happy, though.  Lady Gaga is getting the spotlight in that genre, so she's a moron.  She's trying to, you know, get the crown back.  Yeah.  Lady Gaga.  She should have done, like, instead of going after Lady Gaga, and I know it's hard, but why  didn't she embrace her?  Of course.  And fucking do it.  You know how amazing a show would have been with the two of them together coming out and 
[01:22:00]  doing something?  I would have done it.  It could have made out.  Why are you saying no, Travis?  Madonna's ego would have never allowed it to happen, first of all.  Madonna's ego and probably Lady Gaga's ego.  I mean, they both put on these giant shows.  Yeah.  Although Lady Gaga, it's when you're on top, you resent the new kid a lot more normally  than the new kid resents the icon.  Absolutely.  But do you think that Lady Gaga, who is more popular now, would essentially open for  Madonna? 
[01:22:30]  Because you know Madonna's not going to open for Lady Gaga.  A couple of years ago?  No, I'm talking about right now.  No, no, no.  But I'm going to say a couple of years ago, she would have embraced her.  Sure.  Yeah, probably not.  There's no way Madonna would go first.  Yeah, and that's why it would never.  But she might have just to do a double headliner show with it.  Like, she might have just to do...  Don't forget, you've got Billy Joel.  There's no such thing as double headliner.  And these guys, Billy Joel and Elton John...  They did stuff together, though.  Right.  And these guys are selling out these huge rooms on their own.  Even though Madonna's latest release sucks, she's still selling tickets.  She's not doing soccer stadiums. 
[01:23:00]  But she wants...  She's playing two shows at Yankee Stadium.  Who is?  Madonna.  No, she's still selling tickets.  The problem with Madonna, she's frustrated that no one's embracing these new songs of hers.  That's what this is all about.  Two Yankee Stadium shows?  Yeah.  What is she doing overseas?  I know she's doing Turkey and she's in Rome.  How big are these venues?  Oh, God.  Are they 20,000 seats or no?  Oh, they are?  Okay, wow.  I think.  She's playing a place up in Quebec that fits over 200,000 people.  That's not necessarily saying that 200,000 people will show up. 
[01:23:30]  But she's not doing Madison Square Garden sign places?  No, no, no, no, no.  No, she's doing...  Overseas, she's doing huge places, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, Madonna is, I guess.  She's not over.  No.  But she wants...  It's an issue.  She wants a hit song.  But she needs to transition and realize that her days of being a relevant young pop star  are finished.  And she can still tour the same way Elton John or Billy Joel or any of those guys can tour  forever.  And she can still be relevant, but not in the young, sexy way she was.  It's like, you gotta find a different way to present yourself. 
[01:24:00]  Because really, nobody cares about when you're 53 showing your tit.  It's like, ugh.  It's embarrassing.  And isn't it two completely different genres of music?  I mean, like, Lady Gaga's doing pop songs and she's more of like a dance person now.  Yeah, but...  And Madonna lip syncs.  Lady Gaga doesn't lip sync.  Mm-hmm.  Madonna fucking lip syncs.  You're not playing Madonna songs on Hits One.  No.  Exactly.  Kids don't want to hear Madonna.  Come on.  Kids don't want to hear Madonna.  Come on.  They don't want to hear... 
[01:24:30]  That's all you got.  Come on.  That's it.  Come on.  And now it's up to you.  Come on.  Explain yourself.  Their parents would listen to Madonna and be like, oh yeah, I like Madonna from when  I was a kid.  But the kids are like...  She has stayed relevant a lot more than most people ever dream of.  And I mean, like, pop culture.  Yeah.  Relevant.  But there's got to be a different way to do it.  Like, she needs just one more, another hit song and she's fine, but...  She's been around since the early 80s.  I think she's...  She might have started in 80s.  She needs to stop thinking that people are going to care about our new records.  Nobody cares about new records. 
[01:25:00]  You think anybody gives a shit about Paul McCartney's new record?  No.  No.  They want him to go out and play his hits and that's what he does.  That new song maybe they like.  That Valentine song.  A song.  Grows on you.  It does do.  I'm embarrassed to say.  It grew on me, man.  I'm embarrassed to say.  No, it grew on...  It was...  I just don't know if I like when he goes on my Valentine.  It's like, I don't like the Valentine sentiment.  But the rest of the song I love, I don't love the chorus.  I don't know.  This is a cover anyway.  Is it?  Yeah, this whole album was... 
[01:25:30]  I didn't know that.  Oh, then fuck Paul McCartney.  Oh, no.  Okay, who's the song?  I don't know.  He has to cover other people's songs?  Well, he did like a standards album.  This is good though.  I like some standards.  He said that someday soon the sun was gonna shine.  How good was Fallon's fucking McCartney impression?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little chat.  Yeah, I was having a fun little chat.  Like, God, that's why he's a great impressionist.  Because he didn't go for anything obvious.  He just did a casual McCartney in the dressing room. 
[01:26:00]  Like, that's what that guy...  That's why Jay Moore is such an impressionist genius.  Jay Moore is Woody Allen the other day.  Jay Moore's every impression is original and fucking great.  But, yeah, he picks those impressions no one else is really doing.  His walking...  Who does Woody Allen?  Do you know anyone?  There's a good amount of people that do them, but...  Oh, Fallon did Woody Allen yesterday.  Yeah, but not like Jay.  I'm wrong.  That's an original song.  It is, okay.  Because Jay does a fucking tremendous...  Jay captures people, man, like, in a weird way.  Like, he pointed out that Pollock, who's great, 
[01:26:30]  but I saw him once in an interview point out that his walking is a bit more rhythmic.  Whereas Jay is just really walking.  It's...  He's just fucking awesome.  Who does Larry Merchant?  Who does Larry Merchant?  Larry Merchant doesn't do Larry Merchant.  You know how brave you gotta be to do a Larry Merchant impression?  Yeah.  That's just brave.  Jay just doesn't have...  And what I admire about him is he doesn't have this...  This fucking fear of falling on his face.  Or if he does, he's such a sociopath, he can just walk right through it.  Yeah.  Because that's what stops us, is this... 
[01:27:00]  Like, you know, I'm always scared when I'm on TV.  I'm always scared that I'm gonna be fucking terrible.  And I stink, and it's like everything...  He just doesn't seem to have that.  Does he get a shot?  No, but that's...  There's times where he's not good, I'm sure,  but that just fucking makes him have this ability to fucking...  It's because he's a psychopath.  That might be it.  He's crazy.  He's crazy.  He's crazy.  Love Jay, but he's crazy.  You have to be, I think, to have that fucking...  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  I just panic too much. 
[01:27:30]  Ah, Madonna.  There you go.  That's what we got on her, I guess.  Boy, you're Donna.  Double superstars.  I just hate those fucking arms of hers.  I love her yoga arms.  You know, like her ant arms?  Oh my God, no.  And by those, I mean Anthony, who has guns on him.  Yeah.  Now, she is...  She's got, like, not enough body fat.  Yeah.  It's sinewy.  It's all fucking just...  It looks like tendons.  Yeah.  She had that 91. 
[01:28:00]  I was watching a couple of minutes of the Black and White documentary she did when she was  banging Warren Beatty.  I kind of like that thing.  When I saw it, and Kevin Costner's in it, he has a mullet.  Yeah.  What a fucking horrible mullet Costner had.  He might have been doing Dances with Wolves at that time, so that might have been the hair.  But her arms were like that back then, even.  Mm-hmm.  She looks good for 53, man.  I mean, she's in awesome shape and healthy.  You know she smells, though.  I hope so.  I like pit odor.  Dude, I'm officially a fucking piece of garbage.  I like a fucking good armpit. 
[01:28:30]  Not an oniony period pit.  Officially a piece of garbage.  Not a fucking period pit.  Take your period pits and fucking spray them, you horse.  Yeah.  But you give me a nice, musty...  I'm not even trying to be dirty.  I just love it.  I don't like smells.  Oh, fucking...  Smells drive me fucking bananas.  They do.  I love a good scent.  Yeah.  The more rancid, the better.  No, not necessarily.  Not necessarily.  That's a chemical thing.  That's how nature prevents us from mating with people we shouldn't. 
[01:29:00]  It makes the smells repulsive.  I agree with you.  Right?  Yeah.  A good foot smell.  I've been wearing my gym shoes.  Ooh.  That's a little odd, though.  Yeah, a good foot smell.  Oh, look at that.  I don't like...  Get rid of that!  What's all that hair over your underwear?  Sam stretched and showed his fucking...  It's like almost his pubis was hanging out.  Who taped that there, Sammy?  Boo.  You guys need to keep your eyes off my body and concentrate on the show.  How can we?  I'm sorry when you're fucking sitting there just...  Teasing.  Pulling your shirt up. 
[01:29:30]  Teasing.  Yeah.  Someone's becoming a man.  Oh, there he goes.  Why don't you just tie your shirt up like the prison bitch?  You don't like Josh?  I love Josh.  Because he doesn't touch you.  Josh.  Who are these people?  It's an underappreciated act.  Yeah, yeah.  Josh is a fun guy.  He's a party guy.  Hey!  He's always smiling.  Yeah.  Who are these people?  That's great. 
[01:30:00]  Jimmy.  They're all in Jimmy's little head.  That's just nonsense.  If you knew when I walked around my apartment all day singing to myself and the things I say  that get stuck in my head.  Yeah.  What were you singing yesterday?  I just...  Go ahead.  We're here for you.  No.  We're here for you.  I know.  Come on.  I don't know.  We're here for you.  What were you doing?  I was just thinking.  We're here for you.  I told you.  I've already told this story on the air, so it's...  I remember when I was a kid. 
[01:30:30]  I can't look at him.  I know it's going to be one of those.  Is it going to be embarrassing?  Maybe, yeah.  Right?  Yeah, it is.  Look at his face.  A few stories that have made me cringe.  No, it's not a sexual thing.  No, I mean, Kango had things.  That was bad?  Yeah.  That made you embarrassed?  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit, Jim.  And when I was like, there's a Bugs Bunny cartoon where he's doing something.  He's playing dice.  And I...  Hey, what's up, Doc?  Eee! 
[01:31:00]  Hey, stick this carrot up your ass.  Not that kind of fucking dice.  Oh, I'm sorry, Chip.  Fucking ruined it.  That's funny.  And I forget the noise he made.  It was some weird noise.  Like, some Bugs Bunny thing, which I don't remember.  I was a child.  But I remember as a kid, playing dice with my friends or rolling, playing Yahtzee, whatever  I was doing.  I was probably 10 or 9. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  And trying to mimic that and not being able to do it.  So I kept going, meanie, meanie, mokshab, mokshab, meh.  And then I would roll the dice.  And I don't know why Bob Kelly hates that.  Oh.  But I remembered that.  It's the worst...  What is it, low calorie?  And I don't know why that was in my head recently.  But I remember that from trying to...  Wow.  I want to know the original sound now.  I don't know.  Can we try to find it?  It's terribly douchey.  But Bob...  Just put Bugs Bunny dice and hopefully it comes up that scene. 
[01:32:00]  Wow.  Wow.  How does it go again?  Meenie, meenie, mokshab, mokshab, meh.  But that's wrong.  And I knew it was wrong even when I was a kid and I was doing it.  Oh.  You think that's a bad sound?  I'm trying to remember what the episode that is because I...  I'm surprised you don't know this one.  It might not have even been rolling dice.  I just don't remember.  Well, there was one where he was rolling dice against that big fucking bruiser guy.  And he actually...  He was just like a genie or something.  And he went,  Hey, Swami, you gots to fluence these dice. 
[01:32:30]  Influence these dice.  He goes, you gots to fluence these dice.  Swami.  Yeah.  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  I guess we had another perfect game last night, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Giants hurler Matt Cain throws rare, perfect game.  It's not that rare these days.  That's the second one this year, right?  Yeah, but it's still only the 22nd in history.  But it seems like we're getting more lately.  We have gotten more in the last few years. 
[01:33:00]  The last few years.  Yeah.  Only 22 in history.  22 in history, though.  How many have been thrown?  David Wells threw one.  David Cohn threw one.  Two this year.  Matt Holiday threw one.  He should have been one last year.  How many have there been in the last, say, 15 years?  Oh, then we got the...  18.  What?  The last 18?  Oh, oh.  Then we got the one where the guy didn't get it because of the...  Armando Galarraga.  That's terrible.  You're the only one that still remembers his name.  Oh, God.  We were supposed to remember that guy. 
[01:33:30]  And that's where fucking...  What's his name?  Whatever happened to that guy?  Six in the last eight years.  That's where that cocksucker is.  That's a lot.  Six in the last eight years?  If there's only been 22?  That means there's been more.  How many years old is baseball?  18-something.  Yeah.  18 hundreds.  Let's say 125 years.  1880.  There were two in 1880.  That was the first year that it happened.  So six in the last eight years, that means there's absolutely more happening.  So yeah, there's more happening, but I mean, it's not like...  I mean, you'd think during the dead ball era or something there would be more or...  Who's that commissioner that Bud Sealy is such a piece of shit? 
[01:34:00]  That would have been such a great move to give that guy the perfect game.  The umpire ability was wrong.  And it was...  Oh, no.  The game is...  Like you.  Yeah.  Fucking cock-sucking...  Sometimes you just gotta do the right thing.  Because again, how about...  Ignore the rules.  You're the man.  You can do whatever the fuck you want.  So sometimes you just go, all right.  And it was such a mistake.  But how about this?  If somebody had filled out a fucking piece of paperwork wrong and say...  Or filled out a check to him wrong and that was 80,000 less than it should have been, 
[01:34:30]  would he go, hey, that's just the way it is.  You gotta take it.  No, he'd go, go back and do that.  Oh, you know what?  I stand corrected.  I mean, he mucksham, mucksham, meh.  Whatever happened to that guy?  Who?  The perfect game guy.  Killed himself.  I think he's in the minors.  I don't think he...  See, that was the highlight of his fucking career.  Of his life.  Yeah, I mean...  I think he's in the minors.  He was robbed.  That guy was robbed.  A lot of these guys who throw perfect games and no-hitters are very average to not very good players. 
[01:35:00]  You know, you're just really good one night.  Matt Cain's very good.  Everybody's got good, too.  But, I mean...  What's that?  Everybody's got to play good.  Who is that?  No, no, I'm just saying everybody's got to play good.  What is that?  It's a cottage cheese.  Oh, God.  No, what did you say before that?  Everybody's got to play good and perfect game.  No, what's what you're talking out of the side of your mouth?  You're just talking.  What is he doing?  I think he's just trying to up the number of people in his repertoire. 
[01:35:30]  I don't know, yeah.  Sometimes...  This is talk out of the side of his mouth while opening cottage cheese container guy.  No, this is ex-ball player.  Everyone's got to play good.  Close to third base than mine.  Sure.  That's all I got.  God, you're a motherfucker.  Yeah, a lot of characters come and go in one line.  Once the cottage cheese is open, they're gone.  Well, the cottage cheese is open, so we should take a break, I'm thinking.  Good enough reason.  Once that cottage cheese opens.  We've got the latest Sandusky stuff. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, God.  Travis thinks he's going to take the stand, but I...  Of course.  That's just what I heard.  I'm thinking no, and that was why they played that Bob Costas to interview, and maybe that's  why his lawyer advised him to do it, so during the trial, we can play this, and there's  a denial from you without you taking the stand.  The jury can hear you denying it.  I felt his penis on my back.  Oh, my God.  We've got to go to break.  I hope Sandusky is beaten to death in jail.  I really do. 
[01:36:30]  I hope one of the other convicts beats him to death.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's fine.  And this...  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we got the latest transcript from victim number 10.  Victim number five talks.  Victim number seven is in this a little bit.  Let's eat.  Aye.  The Opie and Anthony Show School of Super Professional Broadcasting presents Phone Calls 101. 
[01:37:00]  Talking to a female listener.  Can I talk to you for a second?  You can, though.  Okay, just try to keep a little quiet and listen to what I'm saying.  I'm just letting you know.  You can't shut up, can you?  No.  Listen, Karen.  Karen, shut the fuck up.  Hold on.  Don't talk.  Don't talk yet.  Right.  Listen.  No.  When someone says listen, you don't go, I'm listening.  You just listen.  Shut up for a second. 
[01:37:30]  You're not...  You don't shut up for a second.  Why don't you shut up?  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Would you shut the fuck up?  Holy shit.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Listen to this one. 
[01:38:00]  I went to Iowa, Dubuque, Iowa.  We roll up to this gorgeous hotel.  Gorgeous hotel.  The kid comes up to me.  He's got a camera.  And he goes, Brewer, your dad has to go.  He has to go now.  And I know I've got about five seconds to get him out in the toilet or it's over.  So I go there.  I open the door.  I'm going to open the door.  There's shit on my fingers.  So I'm like, what is this?  So I'm looking at his hands.  I can't understand where it came from.  It's not on his hands.  And it's fresh. 
[01:38:30]  And I can't tell where it's coming from.  So I pull him up.  And as I pull him up, I put him in the wheelchair.  And I'm looking.  I don't see nothing.  So I roll him in.  And as I'm checking, I can smell it.  So I'm like, oh, man.  I see people looking.  And I look at him.  He's got shorts on.  And I don't know how I missed it.  There's clumps of dung just hanging at his shorts.  I finally get up the stairs.  And I'm showering.  But when I went downstairs, where I took him out of the car, there's a pile that must have  fell out of his shorts. 
[01:39:00]  And it's on the sidewalk.  It's such a surreal moment in life to see, like, where we go in life.  There's a billion flies all over this thing.  And people are just staring at me going,  and I can't believe someone will let their dog just defecate on the sidewalk.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories with Jim Brewer.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the ONA Show. 
[01:39:30]  That's Sandusky shit.  More Sandusky shit.  Sandusky is in a Dutch.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He's in trouble, man.  Oh, boy.  I think he has accepted that.  I think at this point, he just wants it over with. 
[01:40:00]  Right?  Yeah.  I'm surprised they haven't offered him a deal at this point.  I guess they know they got this one.  They don't need a deal.  It's a slam dunk.  Yeah.  But, yeah.  I don't know.  I wonder if his attorney is going to them going,  hey, can we make a deal?  There's probably no deal because they want life in prison for this guy.  Because anything else seems like no punishment.  How about we'll take life in prison?  Just please stop embarrassing me.  Please stop reading the transcripts.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:40:30]  Please.  Stop this parade of grown men talking about how I suck their little peepees.  Wouldn't it be funny if Sandusky on the stand was just talking about,  like, how could they claim they didn't like it?  Every one of them got hard.  Oh.  How could you say you didn't like it?  You don't remember that time?  Oh, boy.  But there's an innocence.  Well, I'll just get it.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  All the literal.  Blaming the victims.  I realized halfway through that.  Well, I love blaming the victims.  I always blame the victim. 
[01:41:00]  Please, it's a two-way street.  If your asshole had hair on it, I wouldn't have fucked it.  That's Sandusky's argument.  It's your fault.  Yeah, your fault.  Well, the alleged victim testifies Sandusky threatened him unless he kept quiet.  Oh, boy.  Jurors heard more graphic testimony Wednesday.  I'll skip to this part.  The 25-year-old man identified in the indictment as victim number 10 said Sandusky performed oral sex on him and vice versa. 
[01:41:30]  Of course, vice versa.  Two guys at once.  In the Sandusky home in 1998 when he was in the seventh grade.  So now he's 26, maybe?  Yeah.  27?  I reckon.  He said, if I told anyone, I would never see my family again, the man said.  Sandusky then apologized and said he loved me, the man said.  Yuck.  God.  Fucking yuck. 
[01:42:00]  Yuck.  Dude, you imagine you're fucking 12 or 13 and you're starting to look at girls and you're like, you know, you kind of got a crush on this one.  Her hair smells good.  Oh, no.  And this fucking 60-year-old or 58-year-old guy with his fucking old man coffee breath is rubbing your leg like you're in a relationship.  Hey, sweetie.  What a fucking disgusting cunt.  This guy is fucked.  I would deal with a good molesting, but I...  Oh, sure.  I'm sure you have.  But keep that love shit out of it, man. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Fuck that love shit.  If you want to fuck me in the ass and mouth, be my guest.  Yeah.  But don't try to kiss me on the cheek.  Don't kiss me lovingly and say you love me.  Fuck that.  Yeah.  You can fuck my ass, but I'm not going to the prom with you.  Everything else is okay as long as you...  That promise of the new golf club.  Keep that love out of it.  Oh, the love.  What's that?  Every day, by the way, I love Sandusky's walk-into-jail activity.  Hey, he's helping load up the car.  Oh, yeah.  He's always got a binder in his hand.  I'm just getting there in a court.  Smile like you don't have a care in the world. 
[01:43:00]  You're being accused of molesting 20 children.  I don't have a care in the world.  I'm just...  Let me help you load the car.  Hey, smile up there, Porter.  They're saying that you sucked their penises and made them suck yours and that you fucked  them in the ass.  I don't care in the world.  This will all go away soon.  Oh, boy, is he going to jail for a long time-o.  He likes lifting up boxes of files.  He's helping out.  He's helping out, right?  Helpful.  Yeah.  Anyway, where were we?  Piece of shit. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  So, he said, if I told anyone, I would never see my family again, then apologized and said  he loved me, the man said, adding that he remained silent about incidents until last  year because I was scared.  I was ashamed and I was embarrassed.  A 27-year-old man identified in the indictment as victim number seven testified that Sandusky,  whom he first met in 1995 as a young boy, would grab him around the knees and then eventually  he would move his hand up my leg. 
[01:44:00]  If I was wearing shorts, his hands would go up my leg toward my groin area, he said.  If he was wearing longer pants, he said, Sandusky would reach in and touch my penis.  Oh, God.  He snakes his arm all the way up his long pant leg.  He's trying to get past the knee like he's trying to steal fucking chips from a machine.  What's that?  Soda.  Yeah, soda from a machine.  He would touch my penis.  Sandusky gave the boy tickets to Penn State football games for more than a dozen years, 
[01:44:30]  beginning in 1997.  Wow.  You get a dozen years of good tickets for the college games.  Just for a little ass play.  He wants to jerk you off and play with your balls.  Yeah, come on.  Oh, what the hey?  Problem?  Problem?  The man testified that he didn't tell the story until last year because it was just something  I didn't want my family or anyone to know.  That's got to suck, huh?  Yeah.  I'll bet.  I just figured I'll keep it to myself and I get to go to these games, so I'll push that 
[01:45:00]  part to the back of my mind.  Yeah, that's a tough thing.  Yeah.  It's going to touch me every once in a while, but I'm going to be sitting on the 50-yard line.  I don't know, man.  I love how it just jumps in.  50-yard line, man.  50-yard line.  That is pretty good.  People wait years and years and never get to sit on the 50-yard line.  Yeah, but I don't want it to hurt when I sit on the 50-yard line. 
[01:45:30]  That's good.  That's really good.  Yeah, that's bittersweet.  50-yard line seats, but you've got to put the little fucking tire inner tube on it.  He's drying you all the sort.  Ha, ha, ha, yes, because Sandusky's fucking it.  He's a bad guy, man.  He certainly is.  A bad guy.  Now we've got a 20-year-old, 23-year-old man identified in the indictment as victim number  five, so this is the third one today.  Later testified that...  Victim number five! 
[01:46:00]  Come on down!  Yeah.  Later testified that Sandusky exposed himself to him in a Penn State sauna in the summer  of 2001.  Who hasn't had that happen?  And afterward, groped...  Wait, 2001, so that's 11 years ago.  So the kid was 12.  So the kid's 12 in a sauna with Sandusky?  He loved those 12-year-olds.  He sure zeroed in on an age, didn't he?  Wow.  So he exposed himself to him in a Penn State sauna in the summer of 2001 and afterward, 
[01:46:30]  groped him as they were taking a shower.  Groped.  Taking a shower again.  What's the difference between a fondle and a grope?  I think a fondle is more like, I'm going to guess like, you know what, I don't know.  Kenny must have thought I said dope.  He just walked in.  I'm going to guess a grope is more of a grab and a fondle is more of a caress or it could 
[01:47:00]  be reversed.  Right.  Jim's on the right track.  Fondling, there's like love involved.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  I thought I said dope.  I always picture fondling  just taking your fingers  and going  like flittering them around.  That sounds about right.  No?  Fondle.  And a grope is just  all five fucking fingers at once.  Whap!  Just grabbing something.  Leaving little bruises 
[01:47:30]  where your fingers used to be.  Yeah.  A grope is definitely  more aggressive than a fondle.  Yeah.  The man said he tried  to get away from Sandusky  but I didn't have  anywhere more to go.  And I just felt  his penis on my back.  Aww.  And I felt his arm  move forward.  Oh boy.  And he touched my area.  Area.  My genitalia.  Oh.  Yeah, was he doing  regular radio?  He touched my area.  Touched my area.  Words hurt.  My naughty bits.  And then he took my hand  and he placed it on his  said the man 
[01:48:00]  who had to stop  several times  to fight back tears.  His what?  I just said his  Let me tell you something.  These are grown men  crying  on the stand.  That is damaging.  That had some effect.  When grown men  are looking at you  and just weeping  at what you did to them  and they're all  telling the same story  you're fucking finished.  Touched my area.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[01:48:30]  Oh.  And then I felt  his penis  on my back.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Who got molested?  Fred Gwynn?  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's the manly cry.  Oh.  I didn't want to do it.  He kept giving me gifts  and then he made me  put his penis in my mouth.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  A deep cry.  Oh boy.  That's bad news. 
[01:49:00]  You gotta have an open line  for the next phone call.  Oh yeah.  Because we got a scenario  for you.  Remember my scenario  was golf clubs.  Yeah.  Da da da da da da.  I had to play with  shitty golf clubs  and I kind of like  debate in my head  do I take a  you know  a molest  for some new golf clubs.  Uh huh.  This guy's got a scenario  for you.  George Washington.  As a George Washington.  George Washington.  Ah.  I like where that works out.  Hi.  That's the George  and Ocean Gate.  Oh.  That doesn't sound the same.  That sounds the same.  Is it an Ocean Gate?  What?  Ocean DTC.  Uh huh. 
[01:49:30]  Think back.  Think back.  You're 13 years old.  All right.  I'm thinking.  Here.  Jerry Sandusky picks you up.  He says look it.  Let's go to the firing range.  and I'll stick my hand  up your pant leg.  The following week  he says  I'll put you  I'll put my  you put your  hold on.  Oh boy.  He's getting all excited.  He's all sexed up.  Someone's  touching his penis  as he speaks.  Yeah.  Put my dick in my  and your mouth  and I'll give you  that nice little  you know BB gun.  And the following week 
[01:50:00]  you get a barata  if he sticks it in your ass.  You like guns Ant.  You do love it.  You love a good gun.  Don't answer.  Don't answer quickly.  Think it over a little bit.  Yeah.  You do like guns.  Yeah.  You're a young  impressionable young lad  and you want some guns.  You're all horned up.  You're all horned up.  You're confused  by your feelings in general  because you get hard  just when the wind blows.  I can't picture this scenario  because at that age  I did have a gun  and I had good old buzz  to bang. 
[01:50:30]  Oh well.  Yeah.  I didn't have a Sandusky.  I had buzz  but although they looked  the same in the face  she was in fact  a woman technically.  Like a good molester.  We thought we had you  cornered.  I know.  Oh well.  Queen Elizabeth on Twitter  said a goer  she's like  I'll bet Sandusky  was old school  and called it his prick.  And you know  he probably did.  That is.  He probably said  something to want you  to kiss my prick.  Hey kids.  Kiss my prick.  Yeah.  Kiss me on the prick.  Kiss me on the prick.  Ah that is old school. 
[01:51:00]  But if you're going  old school  you gotta go pud too.  No prick is how  an old guy would say it.  Kiss me on the prick.  Kiss me on the prick.  My pud got hard.  Wow.  Kiss me on the prick.  Fucking funny.  I was kissing his prick.  Oh it's terrible.  Bunch of prick kissing happening.  Shower him with guys.  That's all we got  on Sandusky unfortunately.  Dude he's in so much trouble.  Not as hot today  as past days.  He's in some hot water.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When is this trial going in? 
[01:51:30]  The prosecution is still  fucking full steam ahead.  Oh yeah.  They got plenty of  other guys coming up.  Boy there's a lot of  damaging testimony  for this guy.  Now they're gonna  go after milkshakes too.  So we talked about  the popcorn yesterday.  Another article.  Now the mayor wants  to go after milkshakes  as well.  Oh no.  So he's going after  the jumbo sized sodas  and other sugary drinks.  City officials  are now considering  restrictions on treats 
[01:52:00]  ranging from popcorn  to milkshakes.  Mmm.  Hey man we're a fat society  but you can't  fucking do this.  Oh speaking of fat.  Yeah.  You rock.  That was too easy.  He just I know.  That was too easy.  He just looked like a boy.  I was going somewhere else.  Isn't today Bacon Sunday Day?  I didn't forget.  Oh right.  I didn't forget.  Right.  Are we doing it?  Yes.  I want to try out  the Bacon Sunday.  This sounds fucking  disgusting.  No. 
[01:52:30]  I was talking to some  people yesterday  and none of them  thought it was  a tasty idea.  I don't know.  Salt and sugar  sometimes work well  together.  Sometimes they don't.  This thing is gonna work.  Like I never liked  mixtures like on my plate.  Like I don't like  if I have like say  stuffing and turkey.  I don't like my my my apples.  So I can never say  that word to to interfere.  Well applesauce goes  on pork chops right?  Yes.  On a pork chop.  That's great.  But certain foods  your apples.  Like you just can't 
[01:53:00]  be there.  Yeah.  I don't think meat  and ice cream  go together at all.  Think about caramelized  bacon.  What?  Can we get it?  And caramelized.  Enough of the talk.  Let's try this shit.  Is Burger King open?  Bacon.  I love how we try to  pretend we're not  being fat shows  because we're doing it  on the radio.  Yeah right.  It's you know  it's on the radio.  Yeah they're open.  Of course he knows.  My favorite my favorite  dish pork chops.  Yeah.  Mashed potatoes.  Sauerkraut.  With a brown sauce. 
[01:53:30]  They brown it up  with some shit.  I don't know the name  of the thing they use.  The thing.  And then a nice  side order of  applesauce.  There's nothing better  in this world.  Do you know I was in a  nothing better.  Mmm.  Sounds tasty.  A restaurant recently  eating and I thought  this little trick they did.  I think it was a trick.  They have calorie counts  on the menu so I was  ordering salmon and  but I normally get  when I'm out like  and steamed asparagus.  Ugh.  But I got grilled  asparagus but had a glaze  on it.  Oh.  And the glaze was awful.  I hate glaze on asparagus. 
[01:54:00]  Don't like a good glaze?  No I don't.  What was the glaze though?  I don't know but I didn't  care for it.  Sweet?  Yes.  In nature?  In tart.  No no vinegar  grillés or whatever.  It was just  might have been cum.  I would hope so.  Because you're pissed  off to cook.  And the calories  they have to put  so to make the other  ones seem like  they're not as bad  they make the asparagus  higher in calories  by I guess putting  the glaze on it.  Like I think they do  that so asparagus  seems like it's 85  calories and then  something else is 150.  You're like ah  it's not that big. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah it's not far  from asparagus  so what the fuck  am I supposed to be?  Interesting.  Not really.  As I said it I realized  it was a terrible story.  Oh that's right.  I'm sorry.  Sorry guys.  So at a meeting Tuesday  members of the New York City  Board of Health  expressed support  for Bloomberg's  sugary drink proposal  and then they started  brainstorming.  Just getting together  and brainstorming.  Brainstorming assholes.  That's what the problem is.  Yeah one guy goes  the popcorn isn't  a whole lot better  than the soda  so they wrote that down  we gotta take care of that.  And then another member  suggested limits to 
[01:55:00]  limits for milkshakes  and milk coffee beverages.  Limits.  Fucking limits.  You can't do this  in America.  Especially when you can  eat what you want  at home.  What a fucking  twat this guy is man.  At the end  it's not gonna do much.  Nah but he  boy.  You cannot legislate  what people can buy.  We don't have to pay for it  but you can't tell people.  The government's not there  to fucking do that.  No.  That's not their job.  They're really not.  The government should really 
[01:55:30]  be kind of an invisible entity  that just makes sure  you look around  you should see the results  of the government  without them being up  your fucking ass  all the time.  Make sure all the roads  are fucking fixed  and shit like that  but as far as  legislating against  food and  your freedom of  making choices  good or bad  it's not their  fucking business.  Speaking of roads  you nailed this.  Dave in New York City  go.  Quick.  Dave go.  What's up guys?  Hey.  This fucking mayor  I'm driving down  the FDR South yesterday 
[01:56:00]  around the 30s  and  they're fucking  potholes  and the road  is so rough  I got a little Honda  fit with fucking  paper socks  and this fucking mayor  is worried about  milkshakes  and popcorn  and soda and shit  and he's not even  fixing the fucking roads  it's ridiculous.  Well let me play  devil's advocate  half of those holes  are caused by  fat people walking  so he probably  figures if he can  cut down on the  milkshakes  walking on the  highway yeah  the city didn't 
[01:56:30]  fix all the  potholes this year  I don't know  maybe they ran  that many because  they ran out of  money though or  something there's  more potholes and  and chewed up road  than I remember  in past years  I didn't notice a  lot this year  especially on the  expressway and  parkway and stuff  like that because I  guess it was a  mild winter  that's your  right sir  but oh well  pardon me  that's your  right sir  pardon me  pardon me  not as bad  no it hasn't  been as bad  on the major  thoroughfares 
[01:57:00]  I don't think  how you doing  Tink  the best fat  story almost  ever happened  two days ago  we didn't even  mention on the  did we mention  the pedicab on  the radio  oh god  did you see  that picture  yeah  we got these  dumb pedicabs  where you get  in the back  like it's a  chariot  yeah  some asshole  bites you  around  looks like a  miserable job  it's a fucking  they're in the  way in this  city  right  they're all  scumbag  hate them 
[01:57:30]  fuckwads  they're taking  the place of  the horse and  carriage I guess  right  I don't know  you're taking  the place of  a fucking  boulder in  the road  and on 46  street  around them  hate those  guys  hate them  hate them  46 street  they got a  block called  restaurant row  so it's  perfect this  happened on  restaurant row  there was a  couple of  out of towners  that were  a bit on  the heavy  side  and they  were so  heavy that  the thing  tipped over  backwards  and they  were stuck  there like  turtles on  their backs  they were  laying on  their backs  because the  little rickshaw  thing flipped  up on its

[02:04:00]  what else is on this record  oh  how much else really  it's a whole album  of fucking hits  and it was  I got a picture  tested  this is the Sundays  being made  oh they're being made  right now  they're on their way up  they better not be milk  I know we should put them  in those NBA envelopes  to keep them cold  this is a good song  yeah this is a good one  man  start to turn that record  you could draw 
[02:04:30]  a fucking definitive line  between albums  that came out  before and after  Sergeant Pepper  that fucking album  changed everything  oh yeah  everything else is so like hokey  a day in the life  might be like  the Beatles song  that's a goddamn good one  right  yeah man  so many fucking hits  it's  it's  astounding  how many fucking hits  the Beatles wrote 
[02:05:00]  crazy  and you gotta remember  no one was doing this shit  wow  all these weird noises  yeah this is all  the production  the production value  you know what album  influenced this album  don't say Jay-Z  Pet Sounds  alright thank you  you're obsessed with Pet Sounds  that's so weird  we are  what's Pet Sounds  the Beatles  they absolutely did  they did not  these boys stunk  no they didn't  I interviewed a few of them  you did? 
[02:05:30]  yeah  on a letter line  not Brian Way  but two of the other guys  I think the Beach Boys  stunk  they didn't stink  they had a couple good songs  they had a lot of good songs  name me one  besides the one you like  any of them  I mean  no  they had a lot of catchy pop songs  I think they were terrible  California Dreamin' wasn't even them  right  that was the Mamas and Pop  that was the Mamas and Pop  yeah  which is a good song  California Girls  was the Beach Boys  that's actually a good song  it's shit 
[02:06:00]  but it's a good song  listen to that  I just think David Lee Roth  don't think David Lee Roth  that's shit  his version was better  get the fuck out of here  so much better  woo  woo  gave his girls to look at too  yeah  these girls are in your mind  the Midwest farmers  daughters  daughters  that's perfect  think he oversang that one  oh there's just a tad  see they're all harmonizing 
[02:06:30]  and then you get David Lee Roth  he doesn't want to harmonize  with nobody  woo  woo  woo  give us a David Lee Roth  woo  woo  this is good  no it's not  daughters  really  you just fucked up this song for me forever  I never noticed daughters before 
[02:07:00]  girls with the wings  I ain't great  we're more than friends for a man  I did good  woo  who's that  why would you take the harmonies out of this  woo  woo  woo  woo  woo  woo  woo  woo  the west coast has the sunshine  yeah  the girls all get so chance 
[02:07:30]  sounds like him singing along to the Beach Boys song in his car  yes  exactly  it's not a cover  it's not a cover  it's the least necessary song ever  yeah  what um  totally  there's no reason to make it  none reason  what's the original year of the song  65  when were the Beach Boys popular  uh  late 60s  mid  actually yeah  mid 60s  they were competing with the Beatles there for a while 
[02:08:00]  they were big right  early 70s  yeah  they were huge  yeah  what about good vibration  but that's exactly what happened  like the Beatles  the Beatles came out with Sgt. Pepper  and just changed the whole fucking game  Troy  wait wait wait  why is Troy in here  we're not talking about eating cum right now  oh shit  he's a big music guy  can I make a comment real quick  a lot of people are complaining that  every time Troy's on the radio  it's about eating cum  I'm complaining that there's other things he talks about  oh  yeah  yes  sorry  I just want to make a comment about the Beach Boys 
[02:08:30]  uh  Good Vibrations is arguably the greatest pop song ever written  why  it's just amazing  it's a good song  yeah  can you do something with this in the club too  not really  it's not really a club song  no but they call it a pocket symphony  what's that  because it's  it's basically  I have a pocket symphony  it starts out like  just rambling  I was going to talk about  something  well you're dick  yeah of course  it was a dick joke  why wouldn't it be  it's fucking  yeah  Thursday  yeah this is a good song  well it just goes through so many different feelings 
[02:09:00]  like the first part  this is a whole different part with the theremin  and then it breaks down  it just has all these different feelings in it  all wrapped into a three minute song  yeah  and this was off Pet Sounds  uh  this was  no  the Beatles put out Rubber Soul  yeah  and then  that inspired  Brian Wilson to do Pet Sounds  once Pet Sounds came out  it blew Paul McCartney's mind  he did Sergeant  they did Sergeant Pepper  oh boy  and Brian Wilson wanted to top it  by doing  to going bigger in production  and he tried to do Smile 
[02:09:30]  and he lost his mind  he couldn't finish it  that's why he lost his mind though  because he was trying to  of Paul McCartney  he was trying to top Sergeant Pepper  and it just drove him crazy  and they put out this song  and it blew everybody's mind  they're like  holy fuck  this was before Sergeant Pepper right  no this was after Sergeant Pepper  the Beach Boys though  could never  break out of that poppy thing  this was  this was supposed to be  after  Sergeant Pepper  it was supposed to be on Smile  right  and they released it as a single  and they're like  this is from the forthcoming record Smile  this is what it's going to sound like 
[02:10:00]  and everybody's like  holy fuck  this is incredible  and Brian just couldn't finish it  he eventually finished it  and it's a brilliant album  if you ever get a chance  to listen to Brian Wilson  it's really good  oh it's incredible  but he didn't do it  with the Beach Boys  no he did it with his band now  and they put all the pieces together  and it's incredible  what year did the Beach Boys  were they together?  well they started in the early 60s  you know  they did all like the  round round I get around  in my room  Surfer Girl  Little Deuce Coop  yeah  Surfin Safari  that was their first single  that's crazy 
[02:10:30]  and Surfin Safari  is a great song too  alright you know what  I was wrong  I was wrong  about the Beach Boys?  yeah I was wrong  of course  but I never liked them  but now what I'm thinking  I don't think of all their songs  that are wrong  they got so many  I'll just hear one  and get annoyed  like alright  you're on the beach  we heard you  yeah they were great  I didn't know that story  about him trying to top  there's a great documentary  I actually gave it to Sam  you can borrow it if you want  it's the whole story of  what happened  and him losing his mind  like he  he was trying to get inspired  and he built a  sand box in his bedroom 
[02:11:00]  and he put his piano in it  of course he did  because it's like the beach  and he would put his feet  in the sand  trying to like get inspired  and he was just so  fucked up on acid  and smoking so much pot  and then he couldn't  leave his bedroom for years  have you seen the  made for TV movie  about the Beach Boys?  you gotta watch it  like it shows him  like when he completely  lost his mind  and he was having his meetings  in a swimming pool  I can't watch that stuff  because I know it's an actor  he thought everybody was  wearing wires  so he had everybody  with him in pools  how genius  yeah  that's also nutty 
[02:11:30]  crazy but  so wait Brian Wilson  couldn't leave his bedroom  in the Beach Boys  or after they broke up?  during when he was  trying to write Smile  and it collapsed on him  he couldn't finish it  he couldn't figure out  all the pieces  how many years  was he working on it?  well the Beatles  put out Sergeant Pepper  in 67  so like late 67  68  until 2011  well yeah  the 70s were really rough  on Brian Wilson  why?  because he was just  he was out of his mind  he just couldn't leave  his bedroom  he was fucked up  was he performing?  not at all 
[02:12:00]  I mean he would do  a performance here and there  but you could just tell  when you look at him on stage  he was scared out of his mind  was he rich though  by that point?  oh yeah  Mike Love went crazy  when his hair fell out  at fucking like 19  poor bastard  he was definitely  mad at that  but he's in denial  because he's still like  oh yeah  he puts that hat on  he's still working  he just fucking  sings his dumb song  well guess what  Roland just walked in  with six bacon sundaes  oh boy  they really fucking  they really go off  with the bacon  don't they?  Roland just looks disgusting 
[02:12:30]  Roland said he also  got a Whopper for Eric  did you really?  did he request  a Whopper?  he requested  a little burger  for himself  so what do you do  with this thing?  that's how they make it  thank you  do you take the big  piece of bacon first?  I don't know  it's just a piece of bacon  in there  it's all lazy  I'm in  oh no  there's bacon bits  in there  yeah  oh my god  bacon bits  dude  dude  I'm not a junk food addict  but this shit is good 
[02:13:00]  fuck  fuck  it smells like bacon  but it's ice cream  I love Anthony  you're just eating  you're just eating  the ice cream  no there's a piece  of bacon on the  no you gotta  dip the bacon  Jimmy  go like this  trust me  get a little caramel  oh no  it's ruining the ice cream  like this  it's good dude  go like this though  I fucking hate it  I hate the bacon  with the ice cream  I'm just eating  the ice cream part  and it's great  oh shit  there's some bacon  on it  but the ice cream 
[02:13:30]  is white  you should love it  yeah  but the bacon  is brown  this is good  it's good man  no the ice cream  the bacon stinks  oh my god  you know what it is  it's just ice cream  and then you  chew on a little  piece of bacon  you really put  the whole thing  together there  but I mean  what a dick  what a  butt deserved  butt deserved  yeah  shut up stupid  no really 
[02:14:00]  you just put  the spoon in  and it comes out  with a treat on it  go fuck your mother  if you can find her  wow  dude this shit's good  I'm really kidding man  I'm sorry  why am I  after seven years  do you still feel  like you have to tell  me you're only kidding  I don't know  because you're my friend  and I'm like  I tease you  but that's a rough one  so I don't want you  to get my buddy  holy shit  fuck this shit  and it's out  I'm not out  it's really good  it is good  bacon  bacon-y ice cream 
[02:14:30]  just stop with the bacon  did you dip the bacon  you really put it  together there  here's the problem  is the fudge  is only on the bottom  ah it doesn't give you  no you can't maintain  your fudge distribution level  maintain your fudge distribution  yeah of course  dude this is ridiculous  more everything  yeah  Jimmy obviously hates it  exactly  you hate it Jimmy  holy mother of fuck  Jimmy  it's  he's chewing down 
[02:15:00]  on the bacon  the best part is  Jimmy trying to throw it  away as he's eating  all the way to the  pail  I threw it out  it's yours  I didn't get one  oh you don't need a big  squeeze guy  dude I gotta say  it's phenomenal  I was fucking  throwing it out  and I did throw it out  but I'm scooping it  into my mouth  as you're moving  toward the garbage  wow  yeah you like that  the best is mixing it up  and then you take a big  spoonful and then you  get surprised  because there's bacon  in the middle  I like the bacon surprise  yeah  you're right  god damn  what's wrong with you 
[02:15:30]  answer why you really  put it together  all he said was  the act of eating  the fucking thing  yeah the ice cream  and then you're chewing  on bacon  yeah then you're chewing  on bacon  wow really  one more bite  finish it up  it's a treat  no I'm good  you're already done  you got fucking  80% of it done  my ex-girlfriend  would do that  we'd eat something  and she'd leave like  1% of it  to convince herself  that she fucking  showed restraint  that'd kick her  right in the pussy  I'll tell you why  I threw mine away  I ran out of bacon 
[02:16:00]  the bacon makes  that shit  that's good dude  that's fucking good  a lot better  than I thought  it was gonna be  yeah I gotta say  it's a fucking  home run  I like a good  mini waffle  for breakfast  not that fucking  not that shit  bacon  how many calories  are these  when you do  like waffles  and you have  a side of bacon  you got syrup  you're already  doing sugar  and fucking bacon  sweet  that's true  people are telling you  man it's not that far  fast  no it's the ice cream  thing  people put ice cream 
[02:16:30]  on waffles  cold ice cream  when you're eating  a waffle though  I mean you're eating  it with this  waffle  when they make this  it is  it's a waffle  a waffle  the one thing  I would improve on  is make sure  the bacon  is really nice  and hot  yeah  maybe when  they don't melt  the ice cream  makes it  you gotta eat it  right away  how's your  whopper  I haven't eaten it  but it smells delicious  I love this  I gotta be honest  a fucking whopper  a good whopper  yeah  fucking  there's nothing  better than a whopper  they do burgers  for breakfast  of course

[02:18:00]  of the Memphis  pulled pork sandwich  and bacon sundaes  eating Burger King  is now actually  worse for you  than getting AIDS  but it's  uh  dude  Taco Bell  just had their  the Dorito thing  it's the biggest  fucking product  they ever released  they've sold  a hundred million  of them  what is that  product again  I don't know  can we look  can we look that up  what exactly  is the uh  Taco Bell  for Dorito  it's the Dorito taco  oh my god

[02:19:30]  like a fucking  like a lion  taking his kill  to the tree  I liked your second  and third attempts too  I couldn't believe  it got away from me  I felt like somebody  fucking  I felt like somebody  fumbling in the engine  I felt like Jackie Smith  in Super Bowl 13  I can't believe  I missed that  that was also like  when the puck  is like right in front  of the net  and the guy's trying  to slap it in  but he keeps hitting sticks  I fucking  you know what  I even got on  what the hell does she want  and Iraq turned around  and looked  and I just got over eager 
[02:20:00]  I'm like  slap it miss  you actually had him  all fucking  I fucking had it  perfect set up  I didn't want to hit it  while it was in his hand  because I didn't want  to hit his hand  that stinks  I should have  and I could have  there's one time  I could have got it  by smacking it up  but I didn't want  to get it all over him  wow  damn it  I know I blew it  god damn it  that would  Iraq would you have been  bummed if that was  on the floor  would have been  disappointing  he's got a mouthful  of whopper  I'm so mad at myself  fuck  I blew it big time 
[02:20:30]  god damn  I don't know  who to apologize to  but I'm fucking sorry  I'm disappointed  sorry to Opie  to Anthony  I'm disappointed  Sam and Travis  we set that up  five minutes ago  sorry to E-Rock's wife  who was probably  really rooting for me  to knock that out of his hand  nice set up  and everything  sorry for the company  sorry to Liberty Media  how many calories  in that whopper  it's gotta be a lot  right  I would say  a thousand  750 to 800  or a thousand  I'm gonna go  maybe they can't  maybe they're trying 
[02:21:00]  to keep it under a thousand  what percent  of a normal human being's  calorie intake  would that be  you think  what is it  around  a guy's what  2500 calories a day  a little more than that  maybe  wow  wow  really  I think  somewhere  how many are in the  whooper  let's see  I want more bacon  calories on a whopper  calories on the old  whopper  whopper  recreational whopper  you just got a whopper  or a double whopper  he's not listening  he's good to go  he's thinking about 
[02:21:30]  wrestlemania again  I have a whopper  with bacon  oh my god  I love how he casually  throws the bacon in  it's not a double  no it's a single  god damn it  I fucking wish  I knocked it out  of his hand  whopper with bacon  he had one bite in  he was one bite into  that whopper  so you had whopper  flavor in your mouth  so he knew the goodness  you had a bite of whopper  oh my god  I should have broken  my arm  that would have suited me  to whopper with bacon  well without bacon  it's 670 calories 
[02:22:00]  I was right  750  bacon's gotta be a solid  200 calories  you got cheese on there  he's not listening  he rocked cheese  he's thinking  somewhere it's cheese  he's thinking about  wrestling too much  cheese bacon  he's about all the time  trying to do a show  those were good  those were good  did you like it  yeah  god damn it  I hated it  I'm worried  I'm gonna have to  have another one of those  down the road 
[02:22:30]  what  oh yeah  that wasn't a one  before they go away  in September  you gotta have another one  is that what they're doing  yeah  they say that  but let me tell you  if that's a big hit  they're gonna keep it  sure  because the fucking  the Dorito taco  or whatever it is  was a hundred  it's the biggest  because they were in trouble  after that fucking  meat scandal  for Taco Bell  oh yeah  like what is it  is it meat  or is it shoe leather  or is it a hat  no matter what the fuck  they were eating  and now it's  always a hat  what exactly is it  is it turkey meat  or is it nat cum  they didn't know  they said it was  ground up nat testicles

[02:38:30]  yes  no  no  no  damn it  there are things  to talk about  meanwhile it's not  really  what is regular radio  doing  all request and  dedication hour  on the nighttime  attitude  I like the nighttime  where it was like  yeah it's all  request and dedication  hour  I remember how  bamboozled I was  when I was in the  studio with you  and realized you  didn't take requests  not true  oh well  very rare  I recorded 100 phone  calls and finally  one would hit the  song I was about  to play  exactly  you play my 
[02:39:00]  request  that's how they  do that shit  and then everyone  calls back up  oh no  oh no  no  no  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  oh my  torment  the  Sam's gonna  just give  you shit  now  when was that  he was born  all those  three years  I remember  that  I feel like  I just worked  driving home  since I yesterday  Sam  where's your  jingle asshole  oh shit  you don't have  no jingle 
[02:39:30]  no I don't  we have jingles  you don't have  no jingle  so you can't  make fun  can somebody  please make me  a jingle  damned if you  do  damned if you  don't  I got a jingle  Sam's not black  this was one of  the many  OP contests  that BAB  decided  one of the many  well  there was the  famous lookalike contest  oh that's true  I remember that one  oh great  that's brilliant  because no one  knew what I looked like  radio 
[02:40:00]  that's brilliant  lookalike contest  on the radio  see ya  alright enough of that  yeah that's how  the requests work though  record phone calls  until you hit one  it's like fishing  yeah  and then people get pissed  threaten your life  because you want to  play some obscure  Joe Walsh song  or something  remember that  I don't know why  they did this  but at AAF  the kids would call up  and they'd be like  yeah I like  an instant request  instant  thinking if they said  instant request  like you'd have to play  the instant request 
[02:40:30]  that's so stupid  we hate a lot of  those little shits  because they all  sound like  Beavis and Butthead  yeah  could you play  Pot USA  butt trumpet  butt  yeah they would just  call up and sound  exactly like  fucking Beavis and Butthead  they all were  imitating  Beavis and Butthead  yeah could you play  some corrosion  of conformity  yeah I want to hear  that one 
[02:41:00]  that was pretty good  like an instant  request  yeah we want it  like instantly  or something  bringing back  Beavis and Butthead  was a bust  huh  huge bust  I tried too  man I thought  it was gonna work  fucking tried  I thought that shit  was gonna work  I thought they were  really gonna focus  on pop culture  clips  too much storyline  maybe they couldn't  get enough clips  either  was that it  they kept doing  the same ones 
[02:41:30]  it was all Jersey Shore  yeah it was like  a lot of Jersey Shore  all those bad  fucking MTV shows  they were doing  you know like  fucking you know  teen pregnant  and fucking babies  and shit  is it still on  I don't even know  I don't even know  either I tried  I was DVRing it  the classics  were always there  and I went with  the whole  maybe the next one  would be a little  better  yeah I know  maybe the next one  I ran out of  maybe the next ones  yeah I know  had to move on  to something else  didn't quite wash  yeah the last episode  was December 30th  oh really 
[02:42:00]  I guess they realized  I didn't realize  oh  I didn't realize  oh  oh  W  B  B  B  B  B  I know  I know  and everybody  says this  there's no music  on MTV anymore  no there  there is  they play  fucking  10 seconds  of a video  while they're  rolling credits  for the show  that's pretty much  the videos  on MTV now  it's like  oh  here you go 
[02:42:30]  they're rolling  credits  on one of their  teen pregnancy  shows  and there's a video  playing  now it's over  yes  real late at night  they'll do  maybe an hour  where they're  playing videos  but the video  starts  and then on  it shrinks down  to really tiny  while they're  showing like  text messages  and other stuff  from MTV viewers  and  yeah  I guess people  could do it  on the computer  yeah  but anybody  wants a shit  yeah  who's gonna  watch videos  oh god  I want to go  the other way  I'm thinking  that maybe  it's time  to bring back  videos  I don't think  anybody would  watch them 
[02:43:00]  online  then why  is it  100 million  views for  Lady Gaga  videos online  search it  and you just  watch that one  you don't have to  sit there  wait for  MTV to play  your video  it's not like  the old days  you used to  sit there  and watch  every video  waiting for  you know  fucking  don't feel  the reaper  by blue  oyster cult  to come on  yeah coming on  we have  in the tease  in the next hour  and occasionally  they would show  Ozzy  they would never  show Ozzy  there's certain  guys like  J.J. Jackson  and shit  Martha Quinn  would never  play Ozzy  no that wasn't  Martha's  strong suit  she played  like Hall and Oates 
[02:43:30]  things like that  did she pick her  songs did they  no I think  they picked  them though  but I think  they took  into consideration  who was there  yeah  what an amazing  cultural impact  MTV had  it was huge  Alan Hunter  will not give up  on the 80s  I was listening  to him on the 80s  channel  he loves the 80s  he loves it  he loves them  oh my god  like these songs  came out yesterday  how do you fake it  like that  you know he can't  stand it at this point  are you sick of it  oh he has to  you just sit and  watch fucking MTV  like video after video 
[02:44:00]  you just sit and  watch it  oh yeah this is great  watching fucking videos  it was a bummer  when it started  over again  and you realize  they're starting  the cycle  that you've sat  there so long  that now it's  burning for you  again or whatever  wait would they  do that  oh god yeah  and yeah it was  the rotation  and they didn't  even change the  order of the  videos  how many hours  didn't have many  I don't remember  anymore Jimmy  I would guess  maybe three hours  somewhere around  there maybe four  bam bam bam  bam bam  and they would have  like sometimes 
[02:44:30]  it took a while  they would just  show like old  Apollo rocket footage  and it was like  fucking three minutes  of that  can you show that  please  well they just  rewound everything  I guess I have no  idea what they  were doing  coming up in the  next hour  it's Santana  Santana had one  yeah they all had  but it wasn't like  a video  it was like film  from Woodstock  sometimes  right  they'd show that  shit  Journey  oh Rod Stewart 
[02:45:00]  wow  this is from  83  this is like the  first broadcast  you know he  actually needed  his stomach pump  by the way  you might not  know this  because he drank  so much cum  that they took  him to the  hospital  I was sick  from something  else  not you  Chipper  oh my god  is this dated  this is a good  song though  I hated Rod Stewart 
[02:45:30]  I did too  but this song  I like  Hot Legs  you're wearing  me out  you're hot  shut up  got down and dirty  a little bit  that song  little bit  little bit  this is a good  tune though  I love 80s bad  guys and stuff  when they have  like the fucking  bandanas  oh yeah  and the torn  and you're like  they would dance  fight  douchey  my mom likes  Rod Stewart  because he keeps  putting out  those standard  cover albums 
[02:46:00]  or something  oh does he  I hate  the older  generations  really know  Rod Stewart  standards  I put out  the standards  I think he's up  to like volume  five or something  at this point  I hate that song  we're having  a party  who does that one  what is that  Southside  everyone knows  what the hell  is this  Southside Johnny  and the Asbury  Dukes  of course  Pepe  is this  hell  hell is for hell  hell is for hell  what's this 
[02:46:30]  dribble  that's  the guitar  I remember  this one  she was pretty  man  she was funny  hot  yeah she was  quirky looking  but quirky  but hot  yeah  I like that  just had dumb  video standing  in front of a tree  tube top  with a suit jacket  like an 80's nightmare  they're a little  pixie cut  yeah  it would be great  as she's singing  if a fucking  if a horsefoot  just came back  and broke her jaw 
[02:47:00]  for no reason  the reason would be  she's a horse herself  she's got horse feet  yeah I remember that one  growing up  and this was such a big part  of your day  why is that  you can't talk  in a club soda  Kenny  oh boy  I'll bet you  I'll bet you  that they're fucking  oh my  now you know what 
[02:47:30]  I'll bet you  they're fucking  gay together outside  and they're arguing  about the hotel bill  you ordered the shrimp cocktail  well I wanted to get  the taste of your  cum out of my mouth  well you didn't have  to take it  he's making an imaginary  drawing on the wall  he's like I told you  I was going to come here  on your back  and then you turned  around here  and it went into your mouth  so therefore  it's your responsibility  see that's what you did wrong  Kenny's face looks like  he's explaining physics  I don't know  what you're doing  sad to say  I know exactly 
[02:48:00]  what he just said  what  we're thinking  maybe doing a live broadcast  and he's  just explained to Kenny  I will bet money on this  this is where  the city is  and this is where  we're  oh wow  we're thinking of broadcasting  that's pretty good  go find out  Kenny  touch your shoulder  if that's right  can Kenny hear us  or no  of course he can  no he can't  he's probably just not listening  he's not listening  what else is  well Kenny can't do  two things at one time  well he can't even do  one thing at one time  that's for sure  let's see what 
[02:48:30]  he just described  oppie  oppie  god Martha Quinn  was young man  oh yeah  I don't want to see  the original broadcast  though  I want to see  like the rocket ship  taking off  once they've been  established  hey let's say  hi to Jimmy in Houston  hey buddy  hey guys  my wife grew up  really sheltered  and didn't have MTV  and so  I was going through  some stuff the other  night with her  on YouTube  hold on now  was she alive  how old is the pig  she's 30  I'm just kidding  wow 
[02:49:00]  wow  wowie  go ahead bro  I'm sorry  so I put on  Yankee Rose  by David Lee Roth  I fucking just  was going through  some popular ones  and she's like  this is the gayest  fucking shit  I've ever seen  in my entire life  I can't fucking believe  anybody thought  this was tough  or cool  but I guess  you know  I guess that's just  she had never seen it  and wasn't alive  in the 80s  I wasn't watching MTV  in the 80s  yeah it's dated  I mean a lot of it  is dated 
[02:49:30]  some of these videos  are rough to look at now  sure  but you gotta remember  the time  okay  yeah  alright  there's a moon landing  bam  bam  go back  oh yeah  oh yeah  from the beginning  Sam  you're just ruining  everything  oh yeah  the rocket  the rocket  lifting off  astronaut  getting out of  the lunar module  they're on the moon  with the MTV flag  and  there it is  wow  alright 
[02:50:00]  JJ Jackson  with you  how famous  was this song  Martha Quinn  is gonna play  some Journey  the new one  from Journey  Separate Ways  the world premiere  video  for Separate Ways  I would get so crazy  when Ozzy  was gonna be on  would ya  yeah  there was that live  one  there was three of them  where he would just  pace back and forth  on the stage  yeah he would just  kind of stumble walk 
[02:50:30]  that was from  fucking  a concert he did  in California  it was  Children of the Grave  Paranoid and Iron Man  with the three songs  Paranoid was the one  that I remember seeing  a lot man  yeah Paranoid  and that was him  from  it was a 1982 concert  I just don't remember  where in California  he was  fuck  and then in the middle  of the song  he just lifted his hand  up and he goes  I love you all  yeah he had his  fucking frosted  I think blondish hair  he had no shirt on  he had taken it off  right  he was all chubby  I hated that  they only played 
[02:51:00]  those three songs  yeah  yeah that one  oh this is great  oh man  look at this outfit  I love the knee pads  and stuff  I like the way he just  walks back and forth  on the stage  like a mental patient  and that's after  Randy was dead  that's Brad Gillis  yeah  but that's a cool  stage set  he had the  fucking castle  oh yeah  and the guy  playing fucking  this was old school  with the basic  fucking  just a giant  light show  but they were  just regular lights  not lasers and shit 
[02:51:30]  he's sweating  and all chubby  but he only has  a few tattoos  that's how you know  how old he is  he's got a  John Wayne body  yeah  I need a rub down  if you knew  by the way  this is the Iron Man  that I would play  when I was walking  by that girl's house  from this show  you think that's douchey  that's so bad  you wanted  her to associate  you with that  yeah the cool lyrics  with the lyrics themselves

[03:25:00]  our intern  Kevin is in  here just  confused as  the day is  long  you see him  looking at  Sal in there  Eric  Sal you  don't know  Kevin you  don't know  what's going  on does he  I was literally  doing the  universal sign  you know  sign language  of say  out loud  one minute  you know  Sam's gonna  go on in  one minute  just stares at  me and  whispers  I don't  know  he's like  I don't  know  who he's  talking  to  I said  it's  not  you  so don't  worry  about it  if you ever see anybody  like signaling from there  with like you know 
[03:25:30]  two fingers up or three fingers up  that means you know  how much time is left  so you're telling me to come  and answer the phone  by putting up my pointer finger  you're like putting up your pointer finger  like over here  like go answer  no no I was pointing it  directly to the ceiling  which usually means  one minute  unless  Kevin  we're talking to you  that's so rude  this  the other one  the tight shirt can answer the phones  okay  you know  why  you get to know him a little bit  I like it  he's either walking out of the room  or he's sitting down 
[03:26:00]  making himself comfortable  isn't he  I like him  it's Kevin  he likes to zone out  Rob you go pick up the phones  what  what do you mean alright  like it's a punishment  just get the fuck in the phone room  and don't respond  I'm ready  I'm ready to go  go  Jesus Christ  Sal  I don't know how you deal with these guys  I uh  it's fun  you like it  I love having these guys around  what do you think of Sal Kevin  I like Sal  he's a nice guy  you don't know what he's saying half the time  you think the phones are on the ceiling  the phones are on the ceiling 
[03:26:30]  what  what  I don't know what I'm talking about right now  Eric  do we put the phones on the ceiling  no  why did he say that just now  I don't know  I was just repeating exactly what you said  you said that was like a good joke  when he pat  no I didn't  I just didn't know what to say to that  you think he's the type that  when he panics  he'll just repeat what you said  hoping that it's right  yeah but he'll do it in a tone  like he's being sarcastic or ironic  or dismissive  or yeah  as if it makes  but the ceiling does have phones on it  kinda  how's the internship going 
[03:27:00]  it's been  you know  we met you your first day  but it's been a few weeks now  it's alright  yeah  or not great  but not bad  yeah  what could make it great  because I hate  I don't like that it's not  you know  great  is it Sal  is he the problem  no it's like  I don't know  it's kind of like  it's nothing that has to do with this  it's like I have to get up at 2.30  to get  like to even get here  you have to get up early  no it's not even that I have to get up early  it's that I have to get up at 2.30  that's early  and  and it's pretty expensive  to like get into the city 
[03:27:30]  every  like three days a week  yeah  how do you get in  um  I drive to Newark  and then I have to take the PATH train  at 4 o'clock in the morning  just to  get here before 5  so I go walk here  how far  I mean we all  have to get here early  Kevin  you're not sitting here  and saying like  this is news  that we have to take 4 o'clock trains  to get here  how far away do you live  from the train station  um  I don't mean to ask  probably like  45 minutes  probably from Newark  you live 45 minutes away  from a train 
[03:28:00]  that gets into the city  at  4 o'clock in the morning  yeah  only the  the path only runs  to a couple places  up in North Jersey  yeah  so that's  is that all it is  the  the early  why don't you just go to bed early  I  try  what do you do  do you go home and nap  no I don't  I can't like take naps  that's the Adderall thing again  I can't take naps  because  what do you mean again  you haven't said that on the air  no  I didn't  I didn't remember which  when the conversation started  on the air  so you're usually Adderall 
[03:28:30]  yeah  how come  ADD  you have to  do you have really bad ADD  not like really really bad  I can function off of it  but  yeah  it just like makes my personality  really dull  ADD does or does  no the Adderall  so why don't you  like stop using it  because then  I feel like  if I came here  not on it  I feel like  I would just zone out  when people are telling me things  even more than usual  okay  because you do that anyway  but like  like when people give me  like food orders  and stuff like that  I feel like  I would forget a lot more  if I wasn't on that  well can we do a test 
[03:29:00]  can we just try  like when are you in next  tomorrow  tomorrow  you want to come in  without Adderall  sure  and then that way  if somebody's like  why do you keep fucking up  you can be like  Sam told me to come in  not on Adderall  alright that works  so you're going to come in tomorrow  just straight ADD  right  okay  because I would like to see  which functions better  Eric  you know  you're the intern boss  do you approve  yeah  don't you think  this is a good thing  because we want to learn  how the interns function best  and you know  I believe strongly  that medication  should only be used 
[03:29:30]  when it's absolutely necessary  otherwise  God has blessed you  with a perfectly functioning body  we can't  and boy has he Kevin  we can't tell him  to not take his medication  can we suggest  we can suggest  we just can't tell him  to outright do so  I'll do it  I don't care  I like not taking it anyway  you're allowed  to not  you're allowed to take  your Adderall tomorrow  if you want  yeah free will  alright  but I would like to see you  not on your Adderall  I won't  there are many times  throughout the day  where I'll say Kevin  and Eric too 
[03:30:00]  every day  we just try to check up on him  just saying like  are you okay  because there are times  he's just like  he does the very large blink  yeah  and like  I'm afraid he's gonna like  fall on me or something  like if I'm sitting in a chair  he's just like  you ever pass out standing up  no  now you say you would zone out  if not on Adderall  but I zone out anyway  that's just  I mean I would literally  walk down the hallway  and see you  with your head down on the desk  presumably sleeping  I was down for like two seconds  well you don't know  if you were asleep  it could have been two hours  that's the thing about sleeping  I wasn't sleeping though  it's the character he does 
[03:30:30]  oh okay  it's innocent Kevin  um  no but I mean you know  so I don't see how  it would get that much worse  I guess  right  eh  it gets worse  I'm fucking loud  that's what I want Kevin  a little personality  alright  you know what I mean  it's not bad to be loud  I don't know like  what it would do at  six in the morning  but I'm still like  really loud  if I don't take it  Matt in New Jersey  you're on After Open Anthony Live  dude Kevin  do you know how bad 
[03:31:00]  Adderall is for you dude  do you know  it's amphetamine salts  you're basically on speed  every day  like uh  it's not gonna hurt you  not to take it  but I really hope  that you can get off it  at some point in time  cause it's not good  for your body  and your bones  have a good day bros  thanks Matt  you should  I mean drugs are bad  yeah whatever  you know what I mean  drugs are not good  drugs are bad  don't you want to be  I don't care  why not Matt  you should care  I mean Matt  that was Matt  Kevin  that was an insult  to  you're still off 
[03:31:30]  on that Matt thing  Kevin why don't you  care about your body  what do you mean  you don't care  I don't know  I just  you're a young guy  I just do whatever like  you're a young guy though  right  you're 21  20  you're 20  you got your whole  stinking life ahead of you  you still got your 20s  ahead of you  yeah  I remember when I had  my 20s ahead of me  you know what I have left  a year of it  and then they'll be gone  okay  it's not that sad  Kevin I still got my 30s  40s 50s  I still got lots of years  20s is you know  just the beginning of adulthood 
[03:32:00]  but  you're just entering  into adult life  why is my twitter up  well  people are allowed to look  at your twitter  it's a public thing  I found  yeah I found a little  interesting tweet  only two hours ago  we have a tweet  okay  he tweeted two hours ago  tweeted two hours ago  who's that in your  twitter picture Kevin  uh  Chico Resch  who's Chico Resch  the announcer for the devils  do you like him  I like his mustache  oh okay  what's your twitter name  for the people  so you can read along  I'm not announcing that on air  can we  okay  no if you don't want to 
[03:32:30]  okay  I'm just asking  well yeah  I won't  but you know twitter is public  yeah I do  but then like  people like  Sal follow me  and retweet everything  I say  alright Sal  if you're retweeting him  what's your twitter name  no I don't want to  plug my twitter  okay  alright fine fine fine  it's Sal617  but besides the point  my twitter name is  not Sam  but it has nothing  to do with any of this  um  no  Kevin  well you can  sort of find him  this way I guess  we're not saying it  directly  but he has a hashtag  in one of his tweets  that says  waking up at 
[03:33:00]  2.30  sucks  you don't like  the wake ups  I woke up  like hallucinating  about something  cause I like  went to sleep  at 11  so  it was just like  weird  why would you do that  then  I don't know  why are you  what were you doing  I tried to go to sleep  at like 9  and I couldn't  you know  well I will say this  the 3 day schedule  makes it a little tougher  yeah  you know  I mean I would think  that  what are you here  you're only here  3 days a week right  yeah I'm here  Monday Thursday Friday  ok so probably  tonight it'll be 
[03:33:30]  easier to fall asleep  yeah right  um  I can understand that  um  but  do you think  you're hallucinating  cause you're not sleeping  and you're pumping  your body full of Adderall  no  like when I'm just  sleep deprived  I just like  imagine things  right  and that's the last thing  you would want to do  is imagine things  no it's actually  kind of fun  maybe we should get  Dr. Steve  um  yeah call him  okay  Aaron in New York  hey what's happening  hey how many milligrams  of Adderall  is this Joker on  Joker  how many  how many milligrams  of Adderall  do you take 
[03:34:00]  40  is that a lot  40  Aaron  uh  I guess  it's an average  dose  the problem is  uh  it's got a half life  of at least 36 hours  ok  you're not gonna notice  any difference  if he doesn't take it  tomorrow morning  he really should take  no Adderall  until Monday  and then you'll really  see a difference  in his attitude  and behavior  ok  when did you say  your days were again  Monday, Thursday, Friday  yeah  can we go  from now until  Monday with no Adderall  do you take Adderall  on the weekends  um  usually not  ok so you're right 
[03:34:30]  alright so you're good  so tomorrow  you're not gonna take any  and then Saturday  and Sunday  you won't take any  so then Monday  you'll be good to go  and we'll see  the real Kevin  oh yeah  you'll see  it'll be out of the system  and he'll be  he'll be  he'll just be  out of his mind  alright thank you Aaron  did Eric come  and his wife  on your wedding night  did Eric come  and my wife  no  and his wife  oh I'll ask  I think you're calling  Dr. Steve  but Aaron  I will definitely  ask him that question  for you  I'm gonna hang up on Aaron 
[03:35:00]  he didn't really get the  timing is not Aaron's  strong suit  but  I wanna  what I wanna do Kevin  is unlock  your fullest  potential  as a human being  during this internship  and I feel like  we can only do that  in your  purest  natural sense  and that means  de-cleansing  I  I  is your response  I  ok that's good  he's doing characters  he is  he's doing a little bit  no I always say I  Eric  yeah  Aaron who just called in 
[03:35:30]  while you were on the phone  with Dr. Steve  was wondering  if you came in your wife  at my wedding  of course  ok good to know  see Aaron  I hope  that's what you do  when you're married  ok alright  I'm learning still  you understand  well I think the bigger  question is  did you come in your wife  at your wedding  that's a disrespectful  question  no it's not  that's way out of line  is there gonna be  a little baby  Sam Roberts  coming  I'll tell you what  if he comes out  looking like you Kevin  I will put him up  for adoption immediately  cause I see what comes out  I see what happens  yeah whatever 
[03:36:00]  alright  I'll adopt him  and there'll be a little me  running around  cause he looks just like me  apparently  I'll adopt him  you sure you want to do  the Adderall  I don't know what he's talking about  I don't know what I'm talking about  um  Charlie  Charlie in Texas  hey Adderall changes  your brain chemistry  it takes months  to get back to normal  that is  if it hadn't eaten  pinhole fucking sized  holes in his brain  like every other Adderall user  not only that  but it causes liver failure  oh my god  it'll be different  in like 5 hours 
[03:36:30]  yeah but I don't want you  to have liver failure  and holes in your brain Kevin  I don't want that for you  that's not the life  I see for you  I want you to have  a brain  that is  full and complete  I want your brain  to look like cheddar  not like Swiss  you know what I'm saying  alright  you know what I mean  and I want your liver  to be functional  now is that a picture  of you with a Hitler mustache  on your twitter  yes it is  because when I shaved my beard  I just went Hitler  for a little bit  that's fun  that's a lot of fun 
[03:37:00]  however  I will say this  if I can offer you  any guidance  generally speaking  looking for jobs  and stuff  after the internship  yeah that's going  yeah  I mean it probably  shouldn't be there  to start with  but who knows  Sal why don't you  go ahead and save that  to the desktop  absolutely  Dr. Steve  wait a minute  you guys called me  to be on the shit show  listen Dr. Steve  oh fuck  at least it's not  weird medicine  okay fair enough  and by the way  weird medicine  I've heard your topics  is literally the shit show 
[03:37:30]  that's true  that's true  that's true  no we had an intern here  who's uh  he's got ADD  but he said  it's not that severe  like what is it  but he's on  it used to be a lot worse  it did  but he's on  40 milligrams of Adderall  okay  and we were thinking  that it would be good  for him to stop  taking Adderall  and just  because he says  he can function  without it  so it seems like  not in school though  but here probably  yeah  yeah it seems like  if he can function  without it  it should be a healthy  a healthy choice  to make right  okay well 
[03:38:00]  here's the thing  Adderall is a  um  uh  combination of  dextroamphetamine  and amphetamine  and the reason  it works for  um  uh  for ADD  is because  it is  basically  speed  and in people  with attention  deficit disorder  it helps them  to focus  on tasks  at hand  and reduces  the amount  of distraction  that they have  from external  stimuli  so uh  now 
[03:38:30]  there are  there's a new  thinking  that people  should stay  on their  medication  even during  summer vacation  stuff  I'm kind of  old school  yeah  I believe  that people  should deserve  a um  a medication  holiday  uh  when they're  not in  a situation  where they  just absolutely  have to have  it  because  a couple  of things  kids  who  are on  Adderall  tend  to tell me  that they  have a better  time when  they're off  of it  you know  they have  more fun  Kevin  Kevin  was just 
[03:39:00]  saying  that  personality  wise  he feels  much more  comfortable  and he's  much more  I don't know  what it is  he's much  more fun  not on  Adderall  like he  doesn't feel  like himself  when he is  on Adderall  yeah  yeah  and I've  heard that  that report  as well  some of the  pediatricians  and I know  Kevin is  a little  older than  you know  he's probably  not going  to a  pediatrician  anymore  but the  pediatricians  that treat  ADHD  will say  that  you know  they used  to say 
[03:39:30]  okay  we just  do it  during the  school year  don't do  it on  weekends  and now  they're saying  just go ahead  and treat  them all  the time  and I  grew up  in the  time  when we  told people  they should  have drug  holidays  during the  summer  and on  weekends  and stuff  so you  know  it's just  it's  a paradigm  shift  that  and I don't  think anyone  in medicine  if you get  10 doctors  together  you're going  to get  10 different  opinions  on this  do you think  ADD and ADHD  is it  over diagnosed  I don't know 
[03:40:00]  if it's  over diagnosed  it definitely  is  I wonder  you think  it is  I don't  have any  hard  I know  I had  ADD  and I  wish that  somebody  had put  me on  some  frigging  medication  when I  was a  kid  because I  had a  hard time  going  through  school  but nobody  knew what  it was  they just  said I  was a  bad  kid  you know  or an  underachiever  I was labeled  as an  underachiever  because I'd  get 99th  percentile on  the Iowa  basics and  then get  C's in  school  because you  weren't  focused  because I  wasn't  focused  exactly  it wasn't 
[03:40:30]  until I  matured to  the point  where I  could focus  despite  my ADD  that I  started to  excel in  school  you know  and I  did really  well  finally  when I  went back  to college  so  at 20  do you  think  Kevin  should  be  at a  place  where  he  can  function  with  ADD  without  you know  drugs  he may  be able  to  now  I  just  heard  him  say  though  that  in  school  he  knows  that  he  couldn't  do  that  is  that  right  Kevin  right  yeah  so  I mean  he  knows  his  limitations  and  all 
[03:41:00]  of  this  the  important  thing  is  it  doesn't  matter  what  my  opinion  is  right  and  it  matters  what  Kevin  is  willing  to  do  to  improve  his  scholastic  abilities  because  that's  really  why  we  treat  people  with  ADD  it's  not  because  they  drive  us  crazy  it's  because  they  don't  function  to  their  capabilities  at least  that's  the  theory  now  whether  you  believe  it  or  not  there  are  people  that  believe  we  shouldn't  poison  our  children  and  drug  them  up  and  stuff  like  that  and  that  can  be  argued 
[03:41:30]  but  it  really  the  and  as  long  as  doctors  following  him  closely  and  Kevin  saying  look  hey  I  feel  better  when  I'm  off  this  can  I  go  off  of  it  during  the  summer  they  can  work  out  an  arrangement  between  the  two  of  them  and  it's  it's  not  something  that's  so  set  in  stone  that  you  have  to  do  it  a certain  way  right  all right  well thanks  Dr. Steve  can I ask  Dr. Steve  one quick question  Sal has a question  for you  quick question  I'm looking at  Kevin's  Twitter 
[03:42:00]  I'm also  finding a few  alcoholic  libations  there  I'm not in  any of them  no  you can't  prove I was there  is it bad to mix  Adderall with  potent potables  potent potables  in  in moderation  in an adult  it's probably  okay  although it is  they recommend  that you avoid  alcohol when you're  on the stuff  okay  let me  I'm just looking  to see if there's  an absolute  restriction  about alcohol 
[03:42:30]  because I'm  looking it up  right now  it's been a while  since I've  prescribed any  Adderall  I'll tell you  what  Kevin  just email me  and I'll let  you know  about that  but it's  you know  that's always  whenever you're  taking  mind altering  medications  drinking alcohol  with them  is always  recommended  that you  avoid that  yeah  just ask  Keith Ledger  no I'm not  commenting  on that  all right  thanks Dr.  Steve  okay  all right  take care  all right 
[03:43:00]  bye  okay bye  bye  so what  has your  doctor  said  you know  have you ever  talked to him  about getting  off Adderall  uh  you don't  you don't remember  you're not quite  sure  I might have  yeah all those  doctor patient  conversations  you don't really  remember all of  I really just  like go in and  bullshit with him  for 20 minutes  and then  leave  just get that  script huh  exactly  I'm with you  um well  you know  you can call him  and ask him  you know  do you think  this is an okay 
[03:43:30]  idea  before you do it  but uh  but yeah  let's  I would like to  see you cleansed  I'll bet you'll be  a more productive  Kevin  and you'll feel  more like yourself  and that's the  Kevin that we need  here isn't it  all right  all right  or  maybe  I don't know  sure whatever  you haven't  you were building  a catchphrase  I remember  I  okay get out of  here Kevin  I'm done with you  listen I want to  talk about something  else I want to  talk about  Steven Singer  and Steven Singer  jewelers  this past few  months you've

[03:45:00]  IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER  dot com  yes  Amanda  you're on  after open  Anthony live  hi  I was just  listening to  how you were  saying he was  on 40 milligrams  a day  and I heard  Dr. Steve  saying he could  talk to his  doctor and stuff  well you would  think that you  would trust  what the doctor  says  myself  I went to  a doctor  for the first  time  I've had  ADD my whole  life  but my parents  were unwilling  to put me  on medication 
[03:45:30]  so when I  was finally  old  I was about  20  pretty bad  yeah  so when I  was about  20 I went  to a doctor  on my own  and I was  excited that  I was going  to be going  to school  and that I  would finally  be able to  focus and  do good  work to the  best of your  potential  exactly  and she  prescribed me  140 milligrams  a day  a day  that's a lot  that's 100  more than  Kevin  yeah  and I only  weighed like 
[03:46:00]  115 pounds  at the time  Christ almighty  and let me  tell you something  Kevin a lot  more than that  significantly  more than that  would just say  that  Kevin is not  I mean he's  the heaviest  of the interns  would just say  that  no no no  he's not that  big I'm not  trying to insult  the kid  okay  but still  you know  and you think  that you're  doing the  right thing  because I  didn't know  any better  than that  I just  knew that  I felt  like I  was smoking  crack all  the time  like it  was not 
[03:46:30]  good you  know  and it's  very hard  to get  off of it  when you're  on that  much  because you  become  addicted  to the  feed  basically  well maybe  we'll have to  wean Kevin  but hopefully  he'll talk to  his doctor  not on 40  milligrams  I don't think  he'll need  to wean  but I  definitely  did I  had to go  into like  a program  Jesus Christ  and this  was all  prescribed  right  yeah  and she  prescribed me  Xanax and  Klonopin  together  which you  can't even  take together  I had to  go to like  different pharmacies 
[03:47:00]  in different  cities and  stuff and  they'd all  look at me  like you  can't take  this  together  you're gonna  die  I wonder  if Dr.  Steve gets  pissed at  these other  doctors that  just prescribe  mountains of  pills for  everyone and  makes everybody  legal drug  addicts  it's amazing  I would  hope so  this lady  is like  everyone I  know that  goes there  is walking  around like  either like  a zombie  or like  they're on  crack all day  you know  alright well  thank you  Amanda  I'm glad  you're doing  better  well thank  you  I listen  to your  show and  opening  Anthony's  show every  day  fantastic 
[03:47:30]  congratulations  I'm engaged  myself  in no rush  no no no  take your time  with it Amanda  take your time  yeah we want  to do it  the way we  want to do it  rather than  rush it for  everybody else  you know  what I mean  that's right  alright thank  you Amanda  alright thanks  Sam  alright  wish she had  ADD with that  phone call  maybe she would  have hung up  a little quicker  E-Rock I was  thinking about  something with  you  cause I gotta  tell you the  truth  we had  bacon sundaes  from Burger  King for  breakfast this  morning  the show did 
[03:48:00]  Burger King  has this new  thing  how was it  where they  have an  ice cream sundae  with bacon  in it  so we brought  them up here  it was absolutely  delicious  I mean it was  to die for  but I'm kind of  feeling like shit  right now  and I think  it's because  I had a bacon  sundae for  breakfast  that would be  it  we were just  talking about  your tummy  troubles yesterday  and talking about  how you don't know  why it is  but you always  there's certain  times I do know  what it's from  but there's other  times where it  happens anyway 
[03:48:30]  despite other  things that usually  cause it  but this morning  Roland is going  downstairs to get  the already  inappropriate for  breakfast bacon  ice cream sundaes  and they weren't  happy to make  them  and you get  a whopper  for breakfast  I didn't order  it  he didn't  no  Roland started  saying that  but he goes  no  he's like  I got you  this instead  yeah  you just  bought him  a whopper  yeah  when he said  I go  hmm  Eric would  enjoy the sundae  but  he will  load the  whopper  okay 
[03:49:00]  but Eric  whether you  ordered it  or not  yeah  what happened  to the  whopper  within 20  minutes of  it being  here  it was  almost  entirely  eaten  I left  two bites  that I threw  out  and you  saved it  when Jim  was trying  to chuck  it on the  floor  you saved  it  like it  was your  first born  that's why  he turned  but  he probably  would have  nailed it  had that  chair not been  in the way  but it was  just too funny  that he slammed  his arm right  into the back  of the chair  Sal Kevin  doesn't know  what you're  saying right  now  don't be  afraid to  just say it  out loud  again  using my 
[03:49:30]  pointer  interruption  you can't do  hand signals  just tell him  out loud  what he needs  to do  grab the replays  yes sir  unplug them  first  okay they're  unplugged  okay so yeah  Eric  were you  thinking to  yourself  while you were  eating the  whopper for  breakfast  he was a bit  disappointed  that he didn't  get the sundae  but I thought  no I wasn't  actually  were you  thinking this  is going to  cost me  later  oh yeah  I was telling  him too  I said  I forgot  how delicious  a whopper  is  but I know 
[03:50:00]  within a few  hours this thing  is going to be  killing me  massive shit  you think so  it's not that  it's not like  that  it just  it fucks with  your intestines  your intestines  well my intestines  so um  so you just get  stomach aches then  yeah  you just go  oh my stomach  now  did you get any  condiments on the  whopper Roland  I said load it up  load it up  load it up  it came with  bacon  yeah the bacon  that was the first  time I had a  bacon whopper  you had to put  bacon on it  specifically  all this is for 
[03:50:30]  you  I said yep  did you ask for  mayonnaise  I said throw  some mayonnaise  in there  that's standard  on the whopper  well Roland  Roland might have  told me that he  asked for extra  mayonnaise  I said extra  of everything  please  oh okay  extra tomatoes  get the veggies  in there  okay that makes  sense  because I was  peeling like  tons of onions  off of it  I'm like what is  all this  so you really did  say I need a  whopper  and load it up  it's breakfast  and who's this  for  for myself  she has the  six ones  how many people 
[03:51:00]  were down in  Burger King  at eight o'clock  in the morning  six seven  and how many  more people  were coming in  how many of  those people  were ordering  bacon sundaes  and whoppers  a lot were  ordering whoppers  is that right  yes  yeah he was  saying a lot  of business  people down  there at  suits and  ties  people really  take advantage  one kid  goes yeah  I need like  eight whoppers  and this  I'm like whoa  the only two  people I've  ever known  to take advantage  of whopper  for breakfast  Bobo  is Danny  when he buys  one for Bobo  before he comes  on the show  and you 
[03:51:30]  when you're  buying one  for Eric  they're only  used for like  joke purposes  you would think  but a lot of  people are  down there  buying whoppers  that's amazing  and the bread  was fresh  and everything  today  I almost got  one  I almost cracked  and got a whopper  you didn't get  a bacon sundae either  no I almost  cracked up for  the whopper  because a woman  oh look  our fresh bread  is here  you're still  on your diet  yeah  how's that going  it's tough man  yeah  I wanted to  eat a whopper  badly  yes  was that what  you do kind of  do you kind of  do you buy food  and live vicariously

[03:56:30]  on Twitter  yesterday  afternoon  not Sam  and Troy  Kwan  but before  we do  that  it was a  very musical  show today  we talked  about 80s  videos on MTV  we talked  about the  Beach Boys  we talked  about the  Beatles  the psychosis  of Brian  Wilson  very musical  show today  yesterday  also somewhat  musical with  Jimmy Fallon  and like I  said  he had a  song on  his album  called T-Bowey  that was a  parody that  he did on  his show  not a lot  of people  know this  but his 
[03:57:00]  T-Bowey  parody  influenced us  here at the  Opie and  Anthony show  don't do it  to do our  own parody  don't do it  this is something  I wrote  an idea that  Travis came to  me with  don't do it  produced  painfully by  Troy Kwan  was this your  most difficult  production piece  you've ever made  in a sense  mentally straining  not like it was  hard to put  together but  just dealing  with that  fucking asshole  you're talking  about Bobo  yeah  okay  this  ladies and  gentlemen  in its  entirety  is the piece 
[03:57:30]  that was inspired  by Mr. Jimmy  telling you how  Eric's stomach  fills  this is  Bobo  Bobo  man  to  O-N-A  Bobo  man  to  O-N-A  let me  on the show  just let me  right back  on  ten  Bobo

[03:59:00]  think  you're  really  great  even  though  your  dick  is  small  and  you  seem  gay  you  fucked  your  brother  once  but  that's  okay  but  they  won't  let me  come  back  on  their  damn  show  I'm  not 
[03:59:30]  lying  sorry  about  that  Bobo  man's  not  dead  no  matter  what  the  haters  said  don't 
[04:00:00]  My IQ's in a double digits  I'm smart enough to know  It's okay to do things when it's for the show  Mr. Maloonigans, I love you very much 
[04:00:30]  I blow him  Bobo Man, ONA  Your show needs help, there's something wrong  Why am I bad, why are you mean?  Can you hear me, ONA?  Can you hear me, ONA?  Can you hear me, ONA?  What, can you hear me or not, alright? 
[04:01:00]  Here on After Oak and Anthony Live, that was Bobo Man.  Beautiful!  I mean, one of my favorite pieces  And it did take a long time to get that emotion out of Bobo  But it was worth it at the end  The cost  The reward was worth the cost  Is what happened  Because that is just  To me, epic is not the word to describe Bobo Man  And I'm sure we'll be playing that  Throughout the history of the Opie and Anthony show  It's going to be featured 
[04:01:30]  For the worst of 2012  Thank you, Eric  Worst of 2012 so far  That's coming up on July 4th  For the holiday, yeah  For the holiday  Anything, any other previews?

[04:02:30]  Call Me Lately  It's maybe  You remember the song  I mean, this thing is so popular  I think on her Instagram yesterday  She was celebrating  Because it was number one now on Billboard  It is the number one song in America  That's right  Right  Thanks to us  And you know who else  Is an After Opie and Anthony Live fan?  Who?  Colin Powell  Really?  That's right  You know how I found that out?  No  Listen to this clip

That's amazing  This is a guy  Who has done so much for the country  I mean  He is  As big as you can get to be  Without being the president  This is Colin Powell  For God's sake  That trumps Donald Rumsfeld  Yeah, it does 
[04:03:30]  It's huge  And Donald Rumsfeld  Is not a fan of this show  He was humiliated on it  However  Colin Powell  Obviously  An avid listener  To After Opie and Anthony Live  As he was singing  Call Me Maybe  The song that Troy brought to me  On this show  And then I made sure  Went to the masses  And we were way ahead of everything  Way ahead  Let me tell you something  We talked about this yesterday  We were playing this song months ago  Way before  Any of these  Any jabroni radio show  That you hear  Playing this song now  Is just biting 
[04:04:00]  Period  If you recall  Back a couple weeks ago  I had taken a picture  With Carly Rae Jepsen  And when she came up here  The talent people  Didn't even know who she was  Right  And I had put it up  On my Instagram  Troy Kwan on Instagram  And I said  You know  Sam  Blah blah blah  And we started playing the song  That day on the show  Right  The talent people  Had no idea  Who this girl even was  This is why  I can take credit for this  And Troy can take credit for this  Cause Troy came in  And he was like  No you gotta hear this 
[04:04:30]  And the day after  He took the picture  When she was up here  And there were no paparazzi  Outside at all  Nobody gave a shit  Nobody gave a shit  We played that song  18 times in a row  I'm sure you remember  Right  That's why we take credit  Now  After the show yesterday  There were all kinds of tweets  Going to Carly Rae Jepsen  Saying listen  You need to really  Stop by after  Open Anthony Live  And talk to these guys  These are the guys  That made you  You know  Troy put you on the map  Sam put you on the map  All this stuff  I get a little  Notification  It says something like
