<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with Opie describing a late-night foray into online pornography after clicking a link on the Drudge Report. This segued into a discussion of sports, specifically the Yankees and Cowboys, filled with highly offensive criticism of players and their performances.  They also expressed their disdain for college football and the artificial crowd noise in NFL broadcasts.  The Emmy Awards were then discussed, with the hosts offering profane commentary on various shows and winners, and derisively commenting on boxing's attempt to mimic the UFC.  A significant portion detailed the hosts' anger over the "Frozen Zone" implemented for Oprah Winfrey's visit to SiriusXM, highlighting the perceived unfair treatment of regular staff compared to top talent.  Office gossip, including incidents involving intern Bobo, and complaints about the nature of their on-air stunts were also aired.  Sam Roberts and E-Rock were mentioned as being present in the studio at different times.

The show continued with complaints about their cramped and inadequate office space, lack of creative freedom, and perceived interference from management. They contrasted their current situation unfavorably with their previous, larger facility, "the Opie and Anthony lab," and recounted difficulties producing segments, citing a McDonald's bit as an example.  They even suggested eliminating staff and restructuring the office, humorously proposing a "retards only" office.  The discussion then touched on Junior Gotti's trial, comparing it to the OJ Simpson trial and discussing prosecutorial misconduct, as well as the appearances of Marcia Clark and Chris Darden. Opie recounted marking offices for removal with red paint, a Times Square encounter with a street performer, and infrequent sightings of Howard Stern. He also mentioned upcoming television appearances and a frustrating encounter with a manager. The hosts reviewed films like *Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*, *The Informant*, and *Love Happens*, offering crude commentary on Jennifer Aniston. They also played a montage of Wolf Blitzer's incorrect answers on Celebrity Jeopardy and briefly interviewed a crew from the "Morning Mashup" show, reacting negatively to the strict rules surrounding Oprah's visit.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion of the difficulty of *Cash Cab*,  followed by a highly offensive commentary on New York Governor David Paterson's low approval ratings and the possibility of a Rudy Giuliani candidacy. This transitioned to gun control, sparked by Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy's stance and a proposed bill regarding firearms on Amtrak trains.  The hosts then launched into a comedic, vulgar analysis of the "Fonzie jumps the shark" scene from *Happy Days*,  followed by critical commentary on the acting in *All in the Family* (specifically Rob Reiner and Edith Bunker), a *Six Million Dollar Man* episode featuring Bigfoot, and a *60 Minutes* report on a new prosthetic arm â€“ all interspersed with vulgar remarks. The show concluded this segment by discussing an upcoming wedding, a karaoke event with potential participant Sal, and a list of karaoke songs, along with further off-color remarks. Jim Norton was mentioned as being in the hallway.

The next segment started with a discussion about karaoke anxieties, which quickly devolved into an offensive conversation about a lifeguard performing CPR on a transvestite. This was followed by a discussion of the Floyd Mayweather-Juan Manuel Marquez boxing match, with guest Jimmy offering commentary.  Audio clips of Mayweather's post-fight interview were played.  The show then discussed Ted Bundy, a listener who bought a gun after a break-in, and a convicted murderer's release at a county fair.  A backstage interview with Bobo, who had been absent from the show, was included.  The segment continued with discussions about Bill Murray, Stephen King, and Leonard Cohen's birthdays, including a YouTube video of Cohen collapsing on stage.  This transitioned to the *Sex and the City* sequel, specifically Samantha's character, and a rant against the UN General Assembly. A comedic skit featuring Anthony Cumia as a *Sex and the City* character was described. The segment ended with a discussion about a Walmart employee finding disturbing photos of children, prompting a debate about child pornography and featuring several calls from listeners recounting similar situations and experiences.

Finally, the show focused on a news story about a couple whose children were taken into protective custody due to photos the parents had taken.  The hosts and callers speculated about the content of the photos, ranging from bath time pictures to those potentially considered child pornography.  They debated whether the photos warranted the removal of the children, discussing the legal definitions of appropriate child photography and the state's potential liability.  Anecdotal stories involving child pornography and Gary Glitter were also mentioned.  The discussion included crude and sexually suggestive humor throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's get the show on the road!  Oh, no.  That's how we start another week of radio.  Oh, I'm ready, Jimmy. Are you...  Are you ready to broadcast?  I haven't slept since yesterday, but...  Oh, Jimmy!  Little lamb! I couldn't sleep last night.  What happened?  Just paying bills.  Ah.  Moral bills, or...  Yeah, financial bills.  Are you ready?  I got caught in a, um...  A porno vortex last night. 
[00:00:30]  Oh.  I thought you meant a porno sting or something.  No, no.  You scared me for a second.  Of the porno vortex.  Like, I'm just fucking around, looking at, you know, Drudge and Fark and all the sites  to just kind of, you know, see what's going on.  Maybe get a few ideas in your head.  It always leads to porn.  And it always leads to porn.  We're weak men.  I'm weak!  I'm weak!  I'm sorry, I'm weak! 
[00:01:00]  You start biting your nails like, oh, look at that.  I gotta click on that.  But I know if I do, it'll be three hours of this.  It was, and it was just a cavalcade of pornography.  What dragged you in?  Where were you?  And then it led to something that you could click on.  Dude, it was a link off of, like, Drudge, believe it or not.  Get out of here.  That said explicit language.  What was the story? 
[00:01:30]  Do you know?  I want to, like...  I don't quite remember.  I want to walk through this.  Because once I hit the porno, you know, everything else went...  But it had to be a story with explicit language.  Yeah, yeah.  It was, and it was a pretty popular news...  Oh, I think it was the fuck a chicken.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  It was...  Good old Ernie Anastas.  Ernie Anastas, the anchor here in New York, on one of the New York stations.  And he said, you know, you keep fucking that chicken.  The story went all over.  The video's everywhere.  Sure. 
[00:02:00]  And I got there, and then there was, like, a link or something on the site that had the audio.  And I was like, what does that click?  And before you know it, you're just...  You're in the labyrinth.  How bad did it get?  It got so bad, dude.  It was probably a good, like you said, three hours of just perusing pornography.  Where you...  It was at the point where it was like, uh...  It was at the point where it was like, I got to the sites with the categories. 
[00:02:30]  All right, this video, this type.  Milfs, biggums.  There's some girl sucking off a dog.  It's just...  Like, what happened?  I was looking at the news.  And then you just keep looking and looking and looking, and then you realize,  it's getting so late.  I've got to...  I've got to go to sleep.  Yeah, you're in, though, at that point.  Porno rules.  There's no logic when you're stuck in the porno world.  That damn porno.  Porno does rule.  And just the fact that it's so readily available, it's right the fuck there. 
[00:03:00]  It's just everywhere now.  It's great.  I might be late to the party on this website, but I tweeted yesterday, hot chicks with dogs  with boners or something like that.  Have you ever seen this website?  Hot chicks with...  You said hot chicks with, and I almost jumped up and typed it in for you.  Wow.  What is she doing?  No, no, no, no.  It's...  Wait, what's the name of the website?  It's called Hot Chicks, okay, with dogs with boners. 
[00:03:30]  All right, they're not doing anything to the dogs.  They're just noticing that...  No, they just happen to be in pictures where the dogs have boners.  They're taking pictures with their little dogs, and the dogs have boners.  Oh, God.  Just one picture after another.  That is fucking funny.  All this hot chicks with dogs with boners.  Go to older.  Wow, is that fucking funny, dude.  Somebody turned me on to this over the weekend.  I said, thank you.  Oh, look at the dog's boners touching her hand.  Look at them all, them boners. 
[00:04:00]  It's great, man.  So...  They just...  It's a newer site.  There's only about 10, 15 pictures so far.  Well, wow.  A lot of people are going to be going there.  And then somebody said, well, what about hot chicks picking up dog poo?  Not as good.  No.  Not as good as hot chicks with dogs with boners.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good one.  So, what time did you get out of the porno maze? 
[00:04:30]  The porno matrix?  I was in there until probably about 12, 15, 12, 30.  You know what the secret is?  You've got to sacrifice yourself.  Yeah.  And you've got to get rid of the poison immediately.  Immediately?  Nah, you've got to find the right setting.  And it just wasn't popping up.  Yeah, but somehow you've got to turn your brain off.  Go, just get rid of the poison and I'll be out of this.  And you'd be like, why am I looking at this?  Exactly.  I think you'd just fucking pass out.  Next thing you know, you're watching the Emmys or something stupid. 
[00:05:00]  What was I doing, Jimmy?  Edging?  What do they call it?  Yeah, it's called edging when you get yourself close.  I like Jimmy's technical jargon.  And then sometimes you've got to go.  Because one, if your thumb even nips the helmet, you're fucking spraying your keyboard.  You ever like, do you ever go to edge and then you're like, ah, and then all of a sudden your dick just starts drooling.  And it's like, you can't stop it.  But you don't come. 
[00:05:30]  It's almost like some came up.  And it's almost like your dick had a reflux burp.  You've got to shove a Tums down your dick hole.  Oh, it's so awful.  Tums very bad for acid reflux.  Me being technical in the middle of them.  Is it?  That's what I'm reading.  If I get a tad, like if I'm feeling a tad because I ate something, you know, a little saucy, a couple of roll aids or something, it just goes away. 
[00:06:00]  It's fixed.  Then maybe it's not acid reflux.  No, it's probably just a little.  Maybe you've just got a little upset tummy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like a little came up.  Yeah.  How about football?  I actually, because the football game was before the Yankee game.  Oh, I thought you were going to say because baseball season is over.  No, it's not.  You're taking a peek at football.  Although the Yankees, ugh, what a game last night.  The Yankees are bored.  They're in trouble.  They're in trouble.  They're getting complacent.  Girardi's got to figure out how to motivate these guys because they're just now sitting around waiting for the playoffs. 
[00:06:30]  No, you know what?  That fucking Jabba, that pitcher, is just, he's shit.  I'm sorry.  How's he shit?  The Yankees have won almost 100 games.  How could he possibly be shit?  He's shit.  He went out there last night.  He was shit.  It was terrible.  Terrible.  Just had a bad outing?  Oh, they were hitting off him like crazy.  Then the base is loaded and he's walking in runs.  How could, I don't get it. 
[00:07:00]  And then Griffey gets up there and hits a fucking home run.  What year is this?  He hits home runs still.  Ah, DH, get out of here.  I suck.  Sit down, you fucking steroid head.  I don't think he ever did steroids, my friend.  I don't care.  That's why, maybe he did though, because he was injured every other freaking at-back.  But I don't know, I don't understand why you're watching baseball when football's happening.  Hockey's right around the corner.  I don't care about hockey though.  College football.  Ugh!  You don't like college football?  Watching that. 
[00:07:30]  You don't like seeing 80 to 17 games?  I hate looking at helmets.  The helmets, I love looking at helmets.  I hate looking at the helmets that I don't know what the fuck the sides mean.  It's like, is this a minor league team?  No, it's college football.  It's a Texas A&M with a Longhorns.  I don't get it.  College football rules.  Texas has so many teams.  You should sit down and watch one college football game.  I have.  The scoring is just amazing.  I like it.  They have no defense.  It sucks.  It's pretty exciting.  I was going to say way more exciting than the NFL, but that's not true.  No, I like to watch a game like the Jets. 
[00:08:00]  Defense was great.  They made the Pats look like the Jets did last year.  Yeah.  And it was kind of fun to watch.  First time I think the Jets beat the Pats in...  2000.  In 2000 years, I mean.  Wait.  First time they beat them at home?  Yeah.  Right?  That's it.  Because the Jets have beat the Pats over the last few years.  It was the first time they'd beaten them on an odd number day.  Those awful stats.  Those stats are so stupid.  The crowd, though, had to come into play. 
[00:08:30]  I don't think Brady could hear jack shit.  It was a really loud crowd.  Especially the second half when the Jets really came alive.  Holy fuck.  That crowd was insane loud.  Watching a nice high def?  Mm-hmm.  Isn't that great?  You know what, though?  How'd you watch football back in the old days?  You were alive.  Why don't you tell everyone?  Well, we sat there in front of a black and white television.  You know what's annoying?  Them pumping in fucking crowd noises.  Because when you have a good system, it is so obvious that one of the tracks is them pumping in more crowd noise. 
[00:09:00]  They mic the crowd.  No, I know they mic the crowd.  But someone exposed the NFL.  They were doing this.  And they were exposed a couple seasons ago, I think.  And ever since, you could hear it now.  Do they do that?  They said they do that to block profanity.  But you know that's not why they do it.  They just want to make every play seem exciting.  They just want to make it bigger than life.  Meanwhile, if it's an exciting play, the crowd's going to yell.  Right.  And the point being, they didn't need to do that during the Jets game. 
[00:09:30]  Because, like you said, it was already a really loud crowd.  The crowd was insane.  They wouldn't let him hear anything.  Right.  Or the team couldn't hear him.  And stupid me.  I just want to show my excitement for my Jets.  Because I didn't really want to acknowledge the Jets last year because of Brett Favre.  Brett Faravery.  Although he's having an okay season so far with the Vikings, which is very strange.  But I love the Sanchez guy.  So I tweeted, we're going to do this. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, my God.  We're going to do this.  And people lost their minds.  Like, shut the fuck up.  You're jinxing them.  Because of that dumb sports curse thing?  Yeah.  They were freaking out.  I'm like, no, this time we got it.  We got it this time.  But the Jets looked really good.  Cowboys, not so much there, Jimmy.  Exciting.  They got a new coach.  The coach rules.  I just hope he doesn't drop dead of a heart attack midseason.  He is the biggest fucking coach in the NFL.  He has to be.  Yeah.  You see how big his waist is? 
[00:10:30]  And then he has, like, a butt that kind of goes up in the air.  Like, he's way too fucking big.  Is he bigger than, what's his name was?  Parcells?  Parcells.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  When Parcells was at his biggest, he was pretty fucking fat.  I think he's even bigger, to be honest with you.  What about Ditka?  Ditka?  Is he bigger than Ditka was?  Bigger than Ditka?  Bigger than John Madden?  Wow.  Not bigger than Madden.  Hell fucking yeah.  Madden's fat fuck.  Well, Madden, when he was coaching, wasn't as fat a fuck as he was when he was doing the, 
[00:11:00]  you know.  I'm sorry.  And he, like, left messages for all the season ticket holders to get really loud for the  Pats game.  Like, the guy is fucking motivated.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  I'm loving the Jets so far.  What happened to your Cowboys there, Jimmy?  I only saw the end of the game because I was working.  The part where they lost?  Yeah, that would be the part.  That would be the big part.  They were down by three.  And they went, well, I think they were down by three and they wound up giving up a field 
[00:11:30]  goal.  So they were down by six.  And then they had a couple of nice runs and they scored, so they went up by one.  And then they start playing that relaxed defense.  And there was one point where they had Manny, first and 20, pinned back in Giants territory.  Nice.  And then it was third and something.  And they gave up those, look, those, there's nothing that bothers me more than with my  team in, like, less than two, under two minutes.  And they start playing that fucking prevent. 
[00:12:00]  And they just kind of, that zone defense.  Yep.  And little, little pick, pick, pick, pick.  And all of a sudden, the fucking team is at the Cowboy 35.  And then I'm like, you assholes.  And they finally blitz.  And they get a bad break because a tipped ball is caught, which you can't, you can't do  anything about.  It's going to happen.  But then the next play is a fucking pass that gives up a few yards.  And that's exactly where they need it to be for the field goal.  I was so, there's nothing that makes me yell more than that soft pick, pick, goes fucking  pick, pick, pick. 
[00:12:30]  It's like this.  You're not going to give up an 80-yard bomb.  Fucking stop it.  It's just that, yeah.  Because they eat the clock and they fucking get down there and they kick and you got nothing.  Just gaining three and a half yards per day.  I was just enough to get the first down.  It's just, it's why I don't watch sports.  It's fucking, I was so angry.  And then I had to pay bills and I couldn't get to sleep.  I was so fucking irritated.  Low bills.  Low bills.  How did, how do you see that as you're watching the game? 
[00:13:00]  And by you, I mean like anybody watching the game.  Yet, the coach doesn't see it.  Like, how do they let that happen?  Because the entire march down the field.  I don't know.  I mean, they make a deal with the other team in the fourth quarter.  Like, we'll play soft if you don't throw a bomb.  It's so annoying.  Because it's just.  I'd rather see them lose on a bomb.  It's just, it's just the thing.  It's just the thing to do.  Yeah.  Unfortunately.  And they can't think out of the box.  Like, okay, we got to like, do this preventive defense, a little zone action, and try to 
[00:13:30]  hold them that way.  Instead of just continuing to play aggressively, that's what got you in the spot to begin with.  So keep playing the way you did.  They don't want to give up a giant play.  And there was one play where the Cowboy, where the guy caught it, but he dropped it.  It looked like he, it didn't look like a drop pass, but it was.  And that went against the Cowboys.  He just stopped the clock with like 120.  The clock would have just kept running.  They would have got that.  Fucking Dallas, I was so annoyed.  Football season rules so far.  This is why I hate sports, man.  I can't handle it. 
[00:14:00]  I forgot how much it fucking hurts to be mad when your team loses in the last second of  the game.  Yeah.  Shit.  The Yankees got a bad call last night also.  Are we going back to baseball?  The Yankees got a bad call at first.  The runner was absolutely out.  And it wound up being like a little rally.  It would have been out.  It would have been three out.  It would have been done.  And I was very angry about that.  That was clearly out. 
[00:14:30]  These umps making the fucking, making a break in a game is the worst thing.  They should use replay.  They absolutely should.  There's too much at stake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where one guy, he's making the fucking game.  He's the guy.  He's the guy.  He's the guy.  He's part of the game.  Yeah, really?  When a guy is getting fucking, like, especially when you get that guy like from the NBA who  was a gambler.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  They shouldn't be the game.  They should make decisions.  If those decisions are wrong, they should be overturned by video.  Yep.  It takes two seconds to look at a fucking video. 
[00:15:00]  I never mind waiting.  I don't either.  Who wouldn't mind waiting?  It's kind of exciting when they come back.  Like, we've decided after viewing the, but yeah.  So, yeah, it was a good weekend for sports.  I want to check out the, I forget, why am I even mentioning it?  The UFC, I didn't get to watch, so why did I just say that?  Sorry, I didn't watch either.  No?  Did you watch the Mayweather fight?  No, I heard it was a bust.  Well, it's boxing.  Boring, yeah.  It's boxing.  Boxing?  They still doing that? 
[00:15:30]  They're still doing that.  I noticed there's a bout coming up on HBO or something.  I couldn't tell you who, what, where, why, but the way they were advertising it, they  really were kind of UFC-ing it up with boxing.  The guys talking smack.  Boxes always talk smack to each other.  Right.  But they were talking about, like, destroying, and the way the camera was going back and forth  between the two of them, you'd watch this thinking, oh, this is some kind of UFC thing.  Trying to hip it up.  Right.  Trying to hip it up, trying to make it, like, extreme, and it's just, it's fucking boxing. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Shut up.  They'll be clinching.  Right.  They'll be little taps to the back of the head before the ref comes in and splits them  up.  A lot of you can't do that.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Or we'll take a point off.  Oh, a standing eight count.  Let's wipe his gloves off.  Give him time to recover.  What's the only thing he can't do in UFC?  Stab someone?  Yeah.  Stab.  And bite his cock.  Under certain circumstances.  I think you've got to leave the sledgehammer outside the cage.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, you're so right, though. 
[00:16:30]  Some dumb low blow or something in boxing.  The whole thing has to stop.  They were saying that, like, one of the guys was like, the only way you're taking me out  of that ring is to kill me.  And it's like, you know, it's boxing.  Shut up.  It's boxing.  The ref is over.  Oh, that can't happen.  You're going to take a few blows to the face, and the second blood starts trickling from  your eyebrow, the doctor will wave his hands, and the other guy will go, I won, I won.  Boxing could get rid of that rule.  Yeah.  Let them bleed out.  Just let them bleed. 
[00:17:00]  Let them bleed out.  They don't care.  Watching boxing, like, try to compete with UFC, it's like watching regular radio try to  catch up with satellite.  It's like, where were you fucking five years earlier, you idiots?  Why didn't you see this happening?  And then they just try to do stuff to catch up.  To try to seem like cable, or radio.  Actually, I was jumping with a gun.  But like satellite.  Well, me and Ant were talking exactly about that.  And like internet.  Yeah.  Because the Emmys were last night, right?  Oh! 
[00:17:30]  And it goes with your point, Jimmy.  Pretty much every award was won by a cable show.  Was it?  Pretty much.  I mean, there were a few exceptions, obviously.  30 Rock M.  What is that?  The cable just destroyed regular TV at the Emmys last night.  Destroyed.  And then they even joked at the end of it, hopefully we'll be able to have the Emmys  on, you know, network TV next year.  That's great.  You know.  They were even joking about it.  The network TV has done...  I'm telling you, man, not to just fuck...  Of course, I'm rooting for the home team, but that's why Leno has a fucking shot, because 
[00:18:00]  there's so many dramas.  You can't compete with what's on fucking cable.  You can't.  The other networks, they're dramas.  I'm sorry.  Lost is great, but it's ending...  They're fucking...  The drama's mostly staked on TV.  Occasionally, they get lucky and get a hit, but for the most part, it's the shittiest  drivel that you'll ever watch.  It's non-violent crime.  They can't really show the violence.  It's unrealistic language.  Language.  No tits.  No fucking...  It's all politically correct.  It's just stupid. 
[00:18:30]  It's fucking stupid.  Oh, look out.  There's a terrorist on this show.  Oh, his name is Bob Johnson.  And he's the white guy that lives down the street.  What a twist.  Meanwhile, they just arrested a bunch of terrorist suspects, and you can't pronounce their fucking  Arab names.  There's not a lot of vowels in there.  Just stop.  Could we have some reality here on television?  On regular TV, the terrorist looks like Rutger Hauer.  Excuse me.  Not accurate.  There's a problem here. 
[00:19:00]  Fucking House.  House.  House.  What?  If House won again?  House.  Did House win?  He was nominated, I'm sure.  No.  I don't even know if House is still on the air.  Best drama series.  Oh, it was nominated.  Okay, I apologize.  Which is on, is that HBO?  Mm-hmm.  Breaking Bad.  That's AMC.  What?  AMC.  AMC.  Damages.  I don't know.  Dexter's on Showtime.  House. 
[00:19:30]  He was nominated.  And so is Lost.  And Mad Men.  Where's Mad Men on?  Is that on cable channel?  AMC, yeah.  That's cable channel, right?  Yeah.  Like I said, mostly cable.  Except for Lost, which is a great show.  Well, it's 30 Rock and Lost, pretty much, were the only other shows that won anything  of significance.  That won anything.  What did 30 Rock beat for comedies?  Entourage, Family Guy, Flight of the Conchords, which I know you love so much, Jimmy. 
[00:20:00]  I'm glad that was nominated, yeah.  How I Met Your Mother.  Which is a good show.  The Office and Weeds.  That's a lot of good shows right there.  Ooh, Flight of the Conchords.  That's a lot of good shows.  Best Actor was Brian, yeah, Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad.  And House U-Laurie, of course, he's always in there.  Best Actress, Glenn Close, Damages.  See, this is all fucking cable. 
[00:20:30]  Supporting Actor, Michael Emerson, Lost.  There you go.  Hey, how about that?  Who'd he beat?  We'll give it to him.  He beat Shatner for Boston Legal.  Did Shatner ever win an Emmy?  I don't know.  He did?  When was that, Travis?  And for what?  A couple years ago.  T.J. Hooker?  No, yes.  Boston Legal, he did.  Boston Legal?  Yeah, he's right.  All right.  I remember seeing his bloated self up there on the stage.  I'm very happy for Michael Emerson.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Very well-deserved.  Supporting Actor, Drama Series.  He's very good.  He is great.  He's all right.  Cherry Jones for 24.  Oh, Best Supporting Actress.  Best Actor in a Comedy?  Alec Baldwin.  How about that?  Give him that one.  Best Actress Comedy?  What is that?  Toni Collette?  Oh, from United States of Tara.  Yes, we did.  United States of Tara is a weird fucking show.  Wait, does she star in that or no?  Oh, yes, she does.  She's the star?  Toni Collette? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, she plays like four or five different people.  That's her?  Oh, yeah.  I've never seen that.  I've heard of it.  She plays a man.  I remember that.  It's supposed to be very good.  A hoity-toity housewife.  A rock rebel kid.  John Cryer wins for Two and a Half Men.  I forgot to bring my picture again.  I'm Mia Caldor.  God damn it.  No, I want to see that.  I'll bring it tomorrow.  Well, who was supposed to win that category?  It could be anybody but John Cryer.  You're not a big John Cryer fan.  I would say. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I'm not a big John Cryer fan.  You don't like John Cryer?  No.  No.  Wasn't he ducky?  Of course he was ducky.  I don't like John Cryer.  Ew, he was ducky in the fucking Molly Ringwald movie?  Yeah, yeah.  His career was dead in the water, and then this Two and a Half Men brought him back.  And he had a bomb series of his own right before that, too.  It bombed.  What was the name of it?  I don't even remember, but it just tanked. 
[00:22:30]  And I was pretty much like, well, that's the last you're going to see of that motherfucker.  But he must have an Uber agent.  Uber.  Well, now he's got an Emmy there, Ant.  I don't even know the name of the bomb.  Was that it?  Shorts?  No.  Maybe it was, no, it wasn't that.  No, no, no, no.  We're all looking.  Trying to figure it out.  Uh.  Metro Chase.  I don't know.  The trouble with normal?  Who knows? 
[00:23:00]  It might have been.  I don't know.  But anyway, it was just a bomb.  It tanked.  Our instant feedback's not working.  What?  Which is making this a little difficult.  I hate difficulties.  Well, I mean, you're talking Emmys, and people want to comment about it, and we don't have  the instant feedback, so whatever.  Damn.  Damn you.  Damn.  My goal is to fucking win an Emmy, my new series. 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  What did E-Rock give me?  Yeah.  Writing for Variety Series, Billy Crystal Sings, Late Show Writers.  E-Rock, I don't know what this means.  Why?  Look at him just walking down the hall.  E-Rock!  See, we're not allowed to have the audio on outside the studio, so this is where that  E-Rock affects us.  I don't know what this means.  Come on, come on.  Watch him run.  Watch, watch, watch this.  I play an international detective.  Ah, watch him run.  My new series on ABC. 
[00:24:00]  No rush.  E-Rock, what is this?  Don't think because you're ignoring me I'm not going to finish this thought.  I know you will.  Of course I will.  E-Rock, what is this?  Well, I know how much you love Billy Crystal, and when he decides to, uh, singing dance  at an awards show.  Oh, no.  This is him singing the name of The Late Show with David Letterman Writers for Best Variety  Series.  Okay.  I thought this was from, like, a past Emmy.  Dude, look, look, look.  Why are you giving me a Billy Crystal fucking...  Oh, did, wait, did Justin and Harry...  I did not know you. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Look at this.  Oh, good.  Look, look.  This is before...  Look.  I see the goosebumps.  Oh, my God.  Before you popped this fucking thing in, I just got such douchey chills.  I swear to God, you see him.  I see him.  Anytime Billy Crystal sings something, I can't look at anybody.  I only saw, like, the first hour and a half, so I missed this.  Oh.  This must have been later on in the show.  I saw Billy Crystal on Letterman a few days ago. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  He might as well be a 90-year-old, out-of-touch, old Jewish guy.  He just...  He wasn't funny.  I'm sorry.  And out of touch.  Just didn't know anything.  I think he was trying to make a Twitter joke.  Oh, really?  And it's like, you know, the Twitter joke...  All right.  Let's hear it.  Maybe it's not that bad.  You guys are judging it.  Let's give it a shot. 
[00:25:30]  Late Show with David Letterman.  Eric Stangle.  Justin Stangle.  Jim O. Holland.  These are guys who write the Late Show.  Michael Barry.  Steve Young.  Tom Ruprecht.  Lee H. Ellenberg.  They're all names that nobody knows.  Matt Roberts.  Jeremy Weiner.  Joe Grossman.  Bill Sheff.  Bob Boyden.  Frank Sebastiano.  And David Letterman.  They're all nomming.  Mated Riders.  Oh, Billy, this is my show. 
[00:26:00]  Aren't you on a ten?  That's nice.  Shut up.  Did they win?  No.  Who won?  Daily Show won for the seventh year in a row.  Yeah, fuck the Daily Show.  What about the Stangle Brothers?  They're great, but I'd say the Daily Show is a well-written show.  The Stangle Brothers have been writing for a long fucking time for that show.  I just...  They should have got a little something-something.  I'm guessing it's because the Daily Show is... 
[00:26:30]  Fuck the Daily Show.  Language.  This is my home.  They've won enough.  Maybe because it's a fucking 30 minutes of writing where it's...  Like, they're writing Letterman's monologue.  And they're liberal.  God.  So, I'm sure...  Letterman.  I know.  Stangles.  I'm happy for them, though.  They all are, actually.  Yeah.  All right.  He's a super agent.  And he's saving because he knows of a plot.  Wait, what's this again?  Because I already forgot.  I want to win an Emmy.  Okay.  For my portrayal of the super agent.  It's called the super agent? 
[00:27:00]  No.  It's called, um...  Undercover agent.  Undercover agent.  Yes.  What's the premise of this again?  Is that there's a lot of things happening that the undercover agent has to let the president  and other people know.  Ah.  But nobody will listen to him.  Wow.  This sounds dramatic.  Yes.  Damn.  Agent Bill Chesterfield.  Bill Chesterfield?  Bill Chesterfield.  I hate Bill Chesterfield.  Why?  Bill Chesterfield's an outlaw.  He used to have a drinking problem. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  His boss doesn't like him.  Yeah.  His wife left him.  Yeah.  For a gentleman of color.  Oh, God.  Bill Chesterfield's are cuckold.  Hey, let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared, this is our big Emmy break.  It's just terrific so far.  Yes.  What do you mean?  What's up, Jared?  Hey, I don't know if you saw it, Opie, because you went to bed early, but they trotted out Sarah  McLaughlin to sing I Will Remember You Live to the Death Reel.  She looks so annoyed.  It's like she stepped on the stage into a fart cloud. 
[00:28:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Nope.  And she sang it live as they did the montage of the people.  Did they allow them to applaud for their favorite dead person?  Oh, yeah.  You know, all hooping and hollering, you know, the frigging pancreas cancer frigging Swayze.  Oh, I want to hear the death thing.  I want to hear it, too.  I want to see it.  I love how people have to applaud for their favorite dead person.  That is so weird to me. 
[00:28:30]  That's a much better death person.  Oh, my God.  That's the best death of the year right there.  And then you got the polite.  And then Jay-Z comes out.  No, wait a minute.  I'll let you get back to this in a minute.  The most important dead person of the year  was not Patrick Swayze.  You didn't mean Jay-Z there, Anthony.  I meant, yes, I meant that.  It's all the same to me.  It is fine.  They're all clapping politely.  Steve Tellbaum lights.  Yes. 
[00:29:00]  Patrick Swayze.  Oh, Patrick!  Yeah, some 96-year-old film editor or something.  Yeah, right.  I don't care.  The guys that you didn't know,  they had to put what they were underneath  like some kind of uber talent agent or something.  Oh, okay.  That's great that Sarah McLachlan  had to sing the freaking song.  Maybe I should pay more attention  to Sam's tweets over the weekend  where it's nothing but rap.  It's nothing but rap music and wrestling. 
[00:29:30]  That is every Sam tweet.  He loves his wrestling.  Enough!  And what rap stars are doing what  and what albums are dropping, yo.  What the fuck, man?  Enough.  Danny, what do you...  I'm going to stop following Sam right now.  Yeah, just drop it.  I'm just going to stop following.  There's not been one Twitter.  Here's a good gauge.  If I have not had one Twitter  that I've read  and has been useful to me in any way, 
[00:30:00]  if there's not been one link  that I've clicked on from Sam  and gotten something entertaining  or fun or educational to read,  why am I following him?  Why?  So now I go to Sam Roberts.  There he is.  Yeah, but he's got a picture of Oprah  on the phone with Jay-Z.  Wait, look!  We should talk about...  Stop following.  Stop following.  There it is.  Just did it.  Oprah and Jay-Z...  Oh, Jay-Z was here for Oprah Friday? 
[00:30:30]  No, no, no.  And that's it.  No more Sam Roberts.  All right.  Thank God.  But we're looking at a picture  that Sam took.  It says,  Damn, Oprah on the phone with Jay-Z.  Gotta love SiriusXM.  I heard the security around here Friday  after we left  got completely insane.  There was a frozen zone  because Oprah was in the building.  You couldn't walk that way?  No.  Was that at the big performance studio?  Yeah.  They actually had a frozen zone.  What the fuck?  You like to at least think  you work for the same company as Oprah 
[00:31:00]  and you could maybe just walk the halls  and just politely go,  Hi, Oprah.  How are you?  No.  She seems to be like a regular gal.  I'm sure she's fine.  She portrays herself on her show  as a regular gal,  so why do they have to have a frozen zone  at Sirius because she's stopping by?  Exactly.  You answered your own question  as you were asking it.  Yeah.  Wouldn't they have an arrow scumbags this way?  Exactly.  That's pretty much the way...  That's how our tree is.  Pretty much.  They bring people around  so they avoid this window. 
[00:31:30]  By the way,  they just...  Like P. Doody,  when he was here,  he could have walked up this way  and passed our studio,  but they brought him all the way around  so we couldn't even see him  because we're such scum.  Yeah.  But the frozen zone  was for everybody  that works for SiriusXM.  What, were they afraid  someone was going to throw  an American tourister bag  in the performance studio?  It was a...  I'm sure it was for a...  At least for almost everybody. 
[00:32:00]  I'm sure not everybody.  It's not Sam's tonight.  Well, let's find out.  E-Rock and Sam were here Friday  for the big Oprah appearance.  Something we just learned recently.  Here comes Sam  to talk about the frozen zone.  I don't know, man.  You'd like to think that  maybe you'd get a peek at Oprah  while you're at work.  No!  Sorry, stop following you, Sam.  Why?  Because I've gotten nothing 
[00:32:30]  from your tweets.  Did you see my last tweet?  Yeah.  What was it?  I've...  I've gotten...  Oh, my Jesus.  I've gotten nothing  from any tweet  you've ever tweeted in.  No, I just posted one.  Oh, that is angry.  Why would someone do that  because she's here?  Oh, God.  What do you mean  I can't take this liquid  on this flight?  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, wow.  Coming back from Freaknik,  that was...  Oh, wait, wait.  What about the frozen zone?  Where was it  and what time  did it take effect?  You know,  what do you know  about the frozen zone  for Oprah Winfrey?  Well, she's doing her show...  And what's the big fear  that we're going to what?  Touch her to get  some kind of magical power?  Not just you.  I mean, 
[00:33:30]  the floor was abuzz  when Oprah was here.  I know.  And she was here  from 2 to 3 p.m.  doing a live show  in the big fishbowl.  And how much  did the company  pay her for that hour?  2 million probably?  I don't know  if there was a direct  per show payment.  Dude, please.  Please.  But, uh...  But, yeah,  I guess I went  like a little before  the show started.  So, like, you know,  5 to 2.  And it was all right,  but there was, like,  every security guard  who you've ever seen 
[00:34:00]  on 57th Street,  you know,  that they used to send over,  they were all  in one spot,  all in the lobby.  There was probably  8 to 10 security guards.  Wow.  And then a lot of people  from sales were up  because it was a big...  It was a big soiree.  Like, they had  hors d'oeuvres  and bottle beverages.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Were most of the  on-air staff invited?  On-air staff?  Like, people like  from the radio shows.  I mean, not specifically.  Like, they had hors d'oeuvres  and stuff?  Oh, yeah.  I thought the company's  in a tight spot right now. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  And people aren't getting raises.  We can't even get anything.  That could have been  somebody's raise, by the way.  Or someone was paid  for something else  that they could get paid for.  Of course.  Yeah, yeah.  No, they had hors d'oeuvres  and bottle beverages.  Oh, good.  She makes 55 million,  by the way.  Mm-hmm.  Don Wiki Wicklin was here.  Holy mother of God.  We're the workhorses.  Work our balls off  every fucking day.  Five million.  She makes 55 million.  I think she has to do, what,  15 minutes a month  or something?  She did an hour this month.  Oh, wow.  Threw us a boat.  She'll probably build them. 
[00:35:00]  But we all have to deal  with her with kid gloves.  Was it filmed, though,  or was it just opening  the thing doing radio?  It was filmed,  and there was a lot of press.  There was like...  Okay.  All right, what about  the frozen zone?  Yeah, and then at, like,  I left probably at 2.30,  and when I left,  the security guard said,  Sam, what are you doing here?  And I was like,  I can't leave  through the front door here?  And he's like,  no, no, you can leave.  I just don't know  how you got in the frozen zone.  So I guess probably at, like, 2.15, 
[00:35:30]  they must have roped off  the lobby of the floor.  How good is it, guys?  Because we're all in the same boat.  We're scum.  I love that we're just scum.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh.  They treat her like a queen  for one visit a year,  and we're here every fucking day  slaving away,  and we can't get the basics.  But it's not even about Oprah.  Jesus Christ.  Because I'm sure Oprah wouldn't care  if people waved at her  and said hello.  It's about... 
[00:36:00]  When you go to, like,  you guys did Fallon,  you did Letterman,  you've done The Tonight Show,  it's like TV fucking studios  who have stars of that magnitude  don't do that shit.  Don't do that.  No.  With their employees.  No.  And they have a lot of people backstage.  Like, you have dressing rooms,  you're not allowed to walk  into the dressing rooms,  but they don't do that,  unless, of course, Obama  or, you know, McCain  or one of those guys is in.  But the TV people  don't fucking do that.  And they have celebrities  there every day,  and they don't treat their people  like a bunch of fucking mutants.  So the average SiriusXM employee  couldn't really see Oprah 
[00:36:30]  if they wanted to.  Probably not,  unless they got there  right when it started.  Sam, you were in the frozen zone.  Now, were there any,  let's just call them,  upper management  watching?  Yeah.  Oh, they were completely allowed.  Yeah.  Yeah, because, you know,  they know they're not  going to do anything.  Was that one?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Was that one?  No.  Nah, he don't care.  Was that one?  No, he don't care 
[00:37:00]  about that stuff.  No.  For a minute.  For a minute?  And then had things to do.  But I'm sure that one  was like,  oh,  I'm going to get right in there.  Oh, that one was...  Get right in there.  Hi, may I speak with you?  Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.  Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.  Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.  What? 
[00:37:30]  Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.  Jimmy, what's that about?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Fuck, I'm pissed now.  I know exactly what it's about.  Of course.  And I was fucking in a good mood.  I started the day  in a fucking good mood.  No, you weren't.  God damn it.  Now I'm in a bad mood again.  Oh.  Which it did, Sam.  That's why I don't have you  as a Twitter friend anymore.  Right.  My tweets aren't that bad.  Your tweets are horrid.  The Frozen Zone was ridiculous.  Boom, right in.  Oh, yeah.  And then you know how, like,  when I was going downstairs, 
[00:38:00]  when I was leaving the building,  I saw, you know how you  have made a point on the air  of how ridiculously hard it is  to get into the building  when you forget your ID at home.  All right, let me explain, though,  for the people.  We have now been here six months.  Yes.  And it's still a pain in the ass  to get in here.  God forbid you forget  any of your badges  or passes or your ID.  Yeah, don't forget that.  You're shit out of luck.  We have to go through.  We go, beep.  This is me going into the building.  Beep. 
[00:38:30]  Beep.  Ka-chong.  That's the turnstile.  Yeah, yeah.  What's that sound like?  Ka-chong.  So you get a beep, beep, ka-chong.  Then you go upstairs  and then another beep  and a hello, how are you?  And a beep.  Right.  It's the other door opening.  Right, right.  And if you don't have this  when I'm holding up,  I know it's radio,  you're fucked.  Right, because you...  All of a sudden,  they're like, who are you?  I'm like, who am I?  You see me every fucking morning  at 5.15.  Figure it out.  Yeah.  What else do you have to do  with your time around here?  Could be an imposter. 
[00:39:00]  Seriously, what else  do they have to do  except memorize shit?  Yeah.  Memorize spaces.  You know that dumb game  where with the cards...  Oh.  The memory game  where you turn over a card  and you're like, okay...  Oh, the...  Old maid?  The pumpkin.  Oh, the pumpkin was over here.  No!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like concentration.  Whatever the fuck it was.  Memory, whatever.  That's all they need to know is...  Guess who?  No, I don't know if it was guess who.  Whatever.  But anyways...  Trouble?  But anyways...  That's a good game.  Was it Yancey? 
[00:39:30]  What are some of them other games?  Robert,  Mousetrap,  Othello,  Criss Cross,  Candy Land,  Hunger,  Hunger,  Hippo,  Shoots and Ladders,  Othello,  Ball Buster,  Finger Longer.  Anyone for Ball Buster?  All right, Sam,  so I just explained  how hard it is for us  that we work in every day.  And then,  if you do forget your ID,  it's a pain  because not only  do you have to show photo ID,  but your name 
[00:40:00]  has to be put in the system  and then they take  a picture of you.  Again.  As a guest.  Right.  So,  I realized when I got down,  it looked like  there was a table  in the lobby  of the building  with a white tablecloth  that said Sirius XM  on the front  and then laid out  on the table  were what looked  to be guest passes  for everyone  in Oprah's camp  that were put there  before they even got there.  Uh-huh.  So all they would have to do  is walk in,  pick up the paper 
[00:40:30]  off the table  and light upstairs.  They're not fucking...  You're standing there.  Cool.  All right,  we'll take a picture.  We'll...  No.  I see some ID.  Can I...  Meanwhile,  I've been here  and I came from the airport  and I had to fucking  scan my luggage.  Yeah.  They have a luggage scanner  down there like...  Take your shoes off.  Do they really?  Yes!  I'm like,  there's nothing in here  but fucking clothes.  There was a rumor 
[00:41:00]  that the elevator  was held  when Oprah...  When they knew  Oprah was within,  you know,  60 seconds of arriving.  But she's supposed  to be a regular gal.  This isn't regular gal shit.  Well, I'm saying  she is a regular gal  but...  She gets the amenities now.  She is the biggest celebrity  in the country though.  Yeah, good for her.  I'm just saying,  Oprah is the biggest celebrity  in the country.  I don't know about that.  Who's bigger than her?  I mean,  Michael Jackson's dead.  Oprah is the biggest...  She's the fucking biggest, man.  She's definitely  the most powerful.  She's the richest.  She's the biggest.  I think Ellen DeGeneres 
[00:41:30]  is actually more famous  than her right now.  Than Oprah?  Than right now.  Oprah is...  Oprah's ratings  were a bit down  leading into this season.  Maybe,  but Oprah is like...  It's like the name Oprah.  You know,  it's just...  Fucking Oprah is...  Ted Sheckler?  Ted Sheckler's different.  He's more mysterious  and iconic.  I see a picture  saying it's happy birthday.  Ted Sheckler.  Yeah, but that's...  Everybody knows Ted Sheckler.  I really want to know  more about this story.  I need to know more  about the Frozen Zone. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  That just drives me nuts.  How angering.  We wouldn't have been allowed  in the Frozen Zone?  Well, I think it's because  as the...  What would the employees  do for real?  As the event  was...  started going  like 10 minutes in,  SiriusXM employees  were getting very excited  about this  and people kept  coming and coming  to the point where  it was hard to walk.  So like the space  between the glass studio  and the wall  was getting completely  filled with people  so there was not  a walkway. 
[00:42:30]  Fire hazard.  So they could have  blocked it off.  But I can see  that they got to do it  for that reason  where just keep  a little aisle open.  Like maybe what we do  around my apartment  sometimes if I have  a lot of friends  and family over  is we put up tape  and we have little  walk areas we call them.  Boo.  I'm tired.  All right, Sam.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  That's great.  So a lot of excitement  here Friday.  Oprah was in the building.  How much did she make  for her appearance  at SiriusXM?  I need to know.  That had to be a lot. 
[00:43:00]  If she makes $55 million...  Maybe it's included  in the price.  I'm sure.  If you divide it  by three years  and then 365 days a year  it's a little over  $50,000 a day  including weekends  and holidays.  A day.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  And we can't get raises  for some of the guys.  All right.  But they had hors d'oeuvres.  It's unbelievable.  It's like two years.  Oh, those hors d'oeuvres.  Huh?  Wait, you have to work  two years, Sam,  just to make one Oprah day? 
[00:43:30]  Like a year and a half.  Oh.  If I start hearing  a buzz about your Twitters  I'll start following you again.  Well, I just posted something  like right before I came in here  that it's...  Oh, now I'm not going to know  what it is.  Was it non-wrestling?  It's non-wrestling,  non-rap related.  Wow.  Yeah.  Must be exciting.  Is it true, too,  that Fez wasn't allowed  to leave the Ron and Fez show  while Oprah was in the building?  That's true.  Because...  What?  Because it was Rosh Hashanah 
[00:44:00]  and Fez had a Hitler mustache.  He was not allowed  to leave the studio  while Oprah was here.  That's funny.  Oh, shit.  And Ron came out  while his show was on  to see Oprah  and Steve Blyder goes,  don't you have a show right now?  And Ron was like,  yeah, but I left Fez in there.  This is...  It's the greatest  just to know that Fez  is not allowed  to do something.  That fucking Ronnie,  that's great.  Why doesn't Fez  have a fake mustache 
[00:44:30]  on hand?  That's funny.  So that it doesn't  get him in trouble.  You can keep it in his pocket  and then when need be  just stick it on  his Hitler mustache  and then he can walk around.  You can use the Hitler mustache  to Velcro the real one on.  Right.  It's perfect.  Very good.  Very good.  A little comb in the back  and then just shove it  into the Hitler mustache  and you're wearing  another mustache  and you look like  maybe you could have  that Sam's dad look.  Yeah, well,  with the handlebar mustache.  Very true.  I don't know what's worse, but... 
[00:45:00]  Hitler mustache.  Yeah.  Let's get all the office gossip  out of the way.  What's going on  with people not allowed  to hang out  outside our office anymore?  Well, no, yeah,  they don't...  The problem was...  See, every Friday  Bobo shows up  and then these guys  do some kind of Bobo stunt  which helps like  the morale of SiriusXM  and a lot of this stuff  ends up on the  Opie and Anthony show  or...  It certainly does.  Or, I don't know,  on a YouTube channel.  Whatever.  Yeah.  It's obvious... 
[00:45:30]  It's material for our show.  Well, we put a box  on Bobo's head  and we're throwing  balls at him  while the box  was on his head  and there were  a couple of people  who said they were not...  That they were appalled  by that.  That they were disgusted  by seeing that  because they thought  Bobo was a part of it.  Is it true that someone  actually came up to you, Sam?  Came up to the office  and said that  they didn't like that.  So we said,  okay, we'll just leave him alone.  We'll just sit...  Because people think  that we're making Bobo  and like intern David  and stuff come in. 
[00:46:00]  They don't realize  that these people  are enjoying this very much.  They're volunteers.  They enjoy being here.  They come in.  We don't even ask them  to come in.  They're a part of the radio show  because they are fans  and they want to hang out.  It's sad to say,  but we gave them lives.  Right.  They're nobodies  without the Oprah and Anthony show.  Was it a woman  that had a problem  and said,  I don't like that you're doing that?  They said some of us.  Why is she sticking her nose  into our business?  I think I remember  the line verbatim.  It was,  we all have a problem with this. 
[00:46:30]  Who's we all?  We didn't.  We just said,  okay,  we took the box office head.  We're trying to make radio.  That's not like sexual harassment.  It's not any kind of harassment  in the workplace.  It's just what it is.  Who are you going to argue with?  Who are you going to talk to?  No one to talk to.  No one to talk to.  They will leave you swinging  by the fucking neck.  There's no one to talk to.  So then a week goes by  and like on Friday,  half a Hulk face  and Bobo were both here 
[00:47:00]  and Bobo gets here  at 6.30 in the morning  and just sits there,  which is whatever.  Fine.  That's what he wants to do.  So he was sitting out there  with half a Hulk face  from 6.30 on  and there was a request  that maybe  having them sit out there  for four hours  was a bit much  and that from now on  they should sit  in one of the offices.  And this is  why I'm enraged today.  Because then...  We had an amazing facility 
[00:47:30]  where we were,  where no one bothered us.  We didn't have other employees going,  we all don't like  what you're doing.  You only had one.  And then they said,  you know,  we're moving you over  to the Sirius XM building  and it's going to be great,  it's going to be great,  it's going to be great,  it's going to be great.  And then they give us  shitty facilities  and we're still trying  to create and do our thing  and now they won't let us do that.  Well, give us a bigger space.  Yeah, because the problem is...  And then you won't see our guys.  We have two tiny little offices  for this operation. 
[00:48:00]  Right now they're  at maximum capacity  with the staff in them  and when you put Bobo  and half a Hulk face in them,  nobody can get any work done  because Bobo just  yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.  So what's going to end up happening  is these guys  aren't going to be able  to hang out anymore  which means  it's going to hurt  the radio show  a little bit  because we won't have him  at our...  What's the word  I'm looking for?  Our beck and call.  Yeah, sure.  We'll have to book Bobo  and he'll have to come in  at the time  he's penciled in for us.  So they're not allowed 
[00:48:30]  to hang out in the hall anymore?  No.  Which was very entertaining  for everybody.  No.  Yeah.  It's fun.  Make good radio  because things would happen.  Then go...  Whoever told you this  go, well,  Opie and Anthony said  all right,  then get us  a bigger  like  work area  a more  efficient  work area.  Get us a green room.  Yeah.  We have nothing.  We have two tiny little offices  and a fucking veal box  that we're broadcasting out of.  Steve actually did argue...  Because Steve argued  this very much 
[00:49:00]  because I said  that because Steve  put the chair,  the comfy chair  and the couch  are in the office  that Steve's in.  Right.  So I said  that's our green room.  That means Bobo  and Have a Hulk face  have to be in your office.  Ah.  So Steve argued  this point very much  and said,  well, let's put them  in the green room  that we have access to.  But we said  we can't put  Have a Hulk face  and Bobo  into the real green room  because what if  a star comes  Yeah, yeah.  And they find Bobo  sitting in there.  Well, that would be  even worse.  What would be the big deal?  What if Taylor Swift  comes in  and all of a sudden 
[00:49:30]  Taylor Swift  can't talk to Bobo  for 30 seconds  before she does  whatever she fucking does?  That's correct.  I like you.  Dude, why did he take  the microphone from you?  He should not have  He should not  He should not  have done that.  Did he give it back?  Did you talk  to Kenny West?  Will you be my girlfriend  and come to the  Queen's motorbid?  My penis looks like  it was chewed off  by Parada.  The bottom half.  Like a bottom  feeder catfish 
[00:50:00]  ate half of it.  Could you spit on me  it will get hard  for no reason.  They throw  oranges at my head.  Well, you have to  go back to this person  and say  this is completely  unacceptable.  Yeah.  And don't kill  the messenger.  Okay.  You know, but this is  completely unacceptable  as far as  Opie and Anthony  are concerned.  We need a place  to create.  We don't have a place  to create here.  We have two tiny  ridiculously small  fucking offices. 
[00:50:30]  We have a massive  facility at the other  place where the guys  could hang all day  and do whatever the  fuck they wanted  which made for  creating some good stuff.  Huge live audience.  We called it the  Opie and Anthony  lab for a reason.  You guys are  experimenting and  figuring shit out  and then it's like  okay, yeah, we'll  bring Bobo in with  the dumb box on his  head.  When I had interned  David in a straight  jacket standing in a  shallow box for an  hour and a half,  I can't tell you how  many people who work  here came up to me  and they were like 
[00:51:00]  wow, it's about time  we actually had some  fun energy back here.  People were really  into it.  Yeah.  And then all of a  sudden there's...  They're turning into a  corporate office.  That's going to be a  huge mistake.  That was the selling  point too by the way  of us moving from  there to here was  hey, there's going to  be energy and action  and there's people  that you can get  reactions off of  and bring in.  Really?  There's people here  that can just  poo-poo what we're  doing.  We tried to bring  people in and now  they walk around  our studio.  Yeah, they walk  around the studio. 
[00:51:30]  That's still the  excitement.  I got yelled at  because I got  Marion Barry in here  for...  Not yelled at,  but I was very  cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like you can't  win.  This one's threatening  this one.  Threatening that.  People start shit,  can't handle it,  and we fucking  crush them.  It's just...  It's silly.  It's silly.  It really is.  It's just silly.  Just ridiculous.  They make it so hard.  This is really...  It should be so easy.  This is the easiest  job in the world,  but they make it  so hard.  I don't get it. 
[00:52:00]  They were all excited  because we fought  for that McDonald's  bit.  Oh, yeah.  And then after the show  Friday, there was  this conversation,  I won't say with who,  and it's like,  we got it done.  After a lot of work,  we got it done.  I'm like,  it shouldn't be a lot  of work.  I looked him right  in the face.  I'm like,  the point is,  I go, thanks,  thanks,  that we can replay it,  but the fact is,  it shouldn't be a lot  of work.  Yeah.  They could spend  their time with  other stuff.  Are you mad,  Jimmy? 
[00:52:30]  No, really,  I mean,  oh, good,  then I'm not either.  I'm just disgusted.  Fuck,  so am I.  Damn it,  and I was in such  a good mood,  but if you're disgusted,  I'm disgusted.  It's infuriating.  They just don't get it.  Ask them what  they're going to do.  If they don't want  our people in the hallway,  then tell them  we need more space,  for real.  That's not even a joke.  Space.  Some of these  are jokes and whatever.  This is a real issue,  though.  We should have  a third office.  We had a really nice  big facility where 
[00:53:00]  we were able to do  whatever the hell  we wanted,  which, you know,  I know I'm saying  it again,  but it led to  some good radio.  And if we can't  have our guys  in the hallway  because we don't  have enough space,  then they have to  give us a bigger space.  Space.  We should have  one office for  retards only.  Dude,  I walk around  this place,  and I see people,  I don't even know  what they do.  Get rid of them.  Take their office.  Knock down some walls.  What the fuck  do they do?  I'm sure it's  very important.  Don't be company,  man. 
[00:53:30]  You know that  half this place  they could just  get rid of.  Like Troy Kwan?  Troy Kwan.  Don't even notice.  Top of list, Sam.  It's like one of  those things,  we have an electronic  device,  and something  falls out of it,  yet it still works  completely fine.  And you're like,  what the fuck  was this for anyway?  Yeah,  and you could just  throw it away,  and it works dandy.  That's what some  of the people are.  Sam,  get me a can of  red paint  and a paintbrush. 
[00:54:00]  Okay.  After the show,  I'm X-ing the offices  that we go.  Wow.  Because I know  exactly who should  stay and who should  go.  And I'm X-ing studios  too, by the way.  Enough.  Enough with some  of these dumb channels.  It sounds very  Nazi-like.  Enough.  Yeah.  I'm walking down  the hall,  and I...  Do you want to  paint an X  or maybe something  else?  Oh, is the X  the bad one?  Put a check.  No, no.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, no.  X is very ancient  Egypt.  Maybe a green check.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I'll do...  A white star. 
[00:54:30]  I'll do something  with the red paint,  which means you're  done.  You're a waste.  You don't need  to be here.  What is that?  Oh, yeah.  Looks better  as a thumbnail.  Don't you hate...  Yeah.  Don't you hate news?  I know, because I was  perusing much pornography  last night.  And it's so  upsetting when a  thumbnail looks a  lot better than  when you blow it  up.  Like, God, that  one had potential.  Yeah.  It hides all the  hurt.  It really, really  does. 
[00:55:00]  It hides all the  hurt.  All right, why  don't we take our  first break?  Junior Gotti's on  trial again.  How much he's  going to spend  in legal bills?  Jesus Christ.  It's got to be  $20,000, $30,000.  That's what I was  thinking.  Tops.  Yeah.  They're going to  get him this time.  You think so?  What are they  even...  What's he even  for?  I don't know.  Does anybody know  what he's on trial  they always got  new, like, uh...  It's like, wasn't  he acquitted or  something?  New charges.  Oh.  Yeah, they just  want him in jail.  Yeah.  So they'll keep 
[00:55:30]  doing this until  they get him to  stay in jail.  That's how they  got his old man.  Yep.  He looks confident,  though.  I'll say that.  I don't know.  We'll see.  He's getting older  and older, too.  He was like a kid  when they first  started this.  Now he's in gray.  Yeah.  He's like an older  guy.  Fourth trial.  Fourth fucking trial.  For pretty much  the same stuff.  Is it really?  What do they keep...  It's for the same  he even said,  I'm not in the  mafia anymore.  Whatever.  But this is for  the same stuff.  Fourth trial for  the same stuff.  Fourth time in  five years facing  a tougher, 
[00:56:00]  bloodier version  of the racketeering  charges first  brought in 2004.  How can they  keep retrying you?  Are they hung  juries or are they  just...  How the fuck  can they keep  throwing you on  trial?  The three earlier  prosecutions ended  with hung juries  and mistreatment.  All three?  Wow.  Okay, so that's...  You know.  So what they do  is they just  fucking bleed the  guy's bank dry  because the state...  If you're found  not guilty,  the fucking state  or anybody  should have to  reimburse you.  That...  The fucking state  should be forced  to reimburse you.  I completely agree  with you.  I do.  Completely. 
[00:56:30]  But you know  something?  Why don't they,  by the way?  Because they're  motherfuckers.  What if it's a  situation like OJ  where everyone  knows he did it,  technical glitches  and fucking police  incompetence or  whatever you want  to call it,  he gets off  and now the  taxpayers are giving  a murderer money.  Okay, you're right.  There's gotta be...  That's odd right there.  There has to be like...  Yeah, there has to be  a quote-unquote  preponderance of the  evidence or proof  beyond a shadow  of reasonable doubt.  There should be some 
[00:57:00]  type of a system  like that in the  other way.  Like that Nifong  guy, that piece of  shit who was going  to prosecute those  Duke guys.  Yeah, yeah.  They should be  absolutely reimbursed.  If it's  prosecutorial  misconduct...  Yeah.  ...or fuck, you  know what?  Police bungling or  the fucking  prosecution bungling  or anything to do  with the state  fucking up, they  should be forced  to reimburse you.  Even if the  guys like OJ?  But OJ was  released because 
[00:57:30]  the jury was not...  A predominantly  black jury was not  going to convict him.  The fuck-ups  weren't big enough  for that jury to  let him walk  legitimately as far  as I'm concerned.  That was a decision  they made because  they wanted to  release OJ.  No, they dropped  the M-bomb with  fucking Mark  Furman and made  that the issue.  Dennis Fung's  mistake.  But then again,  the prosecution  was so stupid  too.  But no, that's a  little bit different,  man.  You raised a good  question, but not  in that case.  It was so cut and  dry, literally, that 
[00:58:00]  you could have  mongoloids up there  prosecuting.  You did!  You did!  Marsha Clark stunk!  Chris Darden stunk!  Darden, what is  he up to these  days?  She was more  worried about  fucking getting  a makeover and  what people were  saying about her  stupid fucking  hair and how  awful she looked.  So she had to,  wow, she does not  even look like it.  She could walk  down the fucking  street, you would  never know that  was her. 
[00:58:30]  She looks better  now.  That hairdo, she  doesn't look better  now.  The blonde hair?  Yeah, she does.  She looks creepy.  She looks different  now.  She looked like a  doll from the  Twilight Zone back  then.  The fucking  rosy cheeks?  Well, it's like  comparing dog shit  with cat shit.  It's like, who  cares?  It's still shit.  Cat shit a little  better.  So you might as  well at least have  your original shit  instead of trying to  dress it up.  Enough about the  shit.  Sam, get the fuck  out of here.  We got a radio show  to do.  Oh, Sam.  Please.  Thank you for the  info.  You're welcome.  The frozen zone, 
[00:59:00]  which just amazes me.  Twitter the big  kidnapping on  wrestling last night.  Teddy Long?  Yeah.  Maybe we'll talk  about that after  the break.  Teddy Long.  And then the  Undertaker's a  kidnapper now.  Yeah.  And then too much  commotion outside our  office at our radio  company.  Oh, my God.  Wow, look out.  Are you kidding me?  Can I get a picture  with so-and-so?  You've got to wait an  hour.  All right.  Does that bother  you, Jimmy?  Fucking radio.  Not bother.  It's such a great  comparison when you  look at the way  other places that I 
[00:59:30]  kind of deal with do  things and the way  they treat you.  It's like, wow.  Okay, I forgot.  That's what it's like  in entertainment.  They want to make  sure you know your  shit.  There's celebrity.  We're part of the  celebrity world, but  we're like the very,  very low end of  that.  And then there's  other celebrities that  actually come in and  you think, oh, not to  pat ourselves on the  back, but we're like,  oh, I think I could  just get a nice  picture with this  person.  And Jimmy has tried  a few times.  He's like, no, no,  no, no, no.  You've got to wait.  You've got to wait  at least an hour. 
[01:00:00]  You know what this  whole atmosphere is  like?  And walking around  the other day, I  noticed, I remember  walking around in a  single fucking radio  station where you  would walk around and  it was just that  station.  Right.  You had your sales  department.  You walked around  in there, the bosses,  and they were  separated from the  talent portion where  your jocks would  stay and the  studio was, the  broadcast studio.  And now I was  walking around here  going, this is like 
[01:00:30]  a Sam's Club of  radio.  You walk around and  there's a shitload,  you don't know  anyone, there's  management and people  that are kind of  telling you what to  do, but they're  kind of not really  sure.  They've never done a  radio show before.  I love the people  that have never done  a radio show before  and they're trying to  tell you what to do.  It's like, yeah,  this is radio Ikea.  You walk in and  you're like, where's  the fucking, I need  to get a panel for  this thing and it's  in another aisle for 
[01:01:00]  my fucking desk.  It's just ridiculous.  Then you ask  someone and they  don't know what the  fuck.  Then you got to  keep it all corporate.  Yeah, yeah.  That is the dumbest  thing ever.  I don't know.  Every employee just  sign something and  say, look, you're  going to be offended.  It's a radio  environment.  Yeah.  That's part of it.  It's not part of  every radio show,  obviously, but the  shows that it is part  of should be allowed  to do their show  like they did when  it was just that  single station. 
[01:01:30]  No one bothered  because they knew  what the fuck the  deal was.  If Opie and Anthony  were on in the  afternoons at AAF,  which, by the way,  they were, no one  was coming by and  going, oh, my God,  was I offended.  We didn't have to  pull curtains.  We didn't have to  kick people out.  We didn't have to  do anything because  everyone knew this  is what they do.  There's no surprises.  Every once in a while  they would put up a  sign, you might see  naked women.  Yeah, yeah.  Which made, like,  all the sales guys 
[01:02:00]  hang out with us all  the time.  Yeah, then they  wouldn't leave.  Right.  But now it's just...  It's weird.  We've been around  long enough to see  the changes.  They want to treat  the news stations  like they do our  show or the 80s  channel like they  do our show  with the exact same  rules in place.  It doesn't work that  way.  If you walked around  the hallways of  Light FM here in  New York, just plays  the light music to get  the chick jocks and  everything, it's going  to be a completely  different environment  than any W was when 
[01:02:30]  it was us and Ron  and Fez and it was  pandemonium.  Why can't they accept  that that's how radio  shows work?  Now it's this pristine  atmosphere that everyone  has to adhere to or you  get in trouble.  And how are you supposed  to do those different  types of shows and have  that different dynamic  when you have to stay  on the same set of  rules?  I got an answer for  you, but, you know,  they're not paying me  for my consulting.  I mean...  What's the matter?  Check bounds? 
[01:03:00]  It's really simple,  though, for real.  It's the basic stuff.  Have a wing of this  floor where it shows  like ours or whatnot  and then like the  dumb channels that no  one listens to and  that have people that  might be offended that  work on those channels,  have them on another  part of the floor.  Separate it a little  bit.  Like this is like the  dirty wing.  The naughty wing.  This is the naughty  wing.  So you know going in, 
[01:03:30]  oh, I'm heading into  the naughty wing because  I have to walk through.  Okay, I'm going to  and I might see  something.  That is a great...  But that's my choice  because I could walk  around and go another  way.  You know what?  That's a great idea if  the naughty wing wasn't  taken up by one show.  Because that could make  a huge naughty wing.  But the naughty wing,  no one's even allowed to  go in there.  It's a half of the  building.  It's a frozen zone.  And it's a complete  frozen zone 24-7.  And that's the naughty 
[01:04:00]  wing.  Speaking of which,  what has been seen  more?  A Yeti or a Bigfoot  or Howard Stern?  In this building?  Yeah.  For real?  Well, I think a Yeti  was here yesterday.  What?  What?  I don't get it.  Sunday?  Yesterday?  Oh, I mean Friday.  I'm an idiot.  I thought today was  Friday.  Jesus.  That would have been  today.  I know.  Has there been any  Howard sightings in the  last six months?  I saw him once.  You saw him once? 
[01:04:30]  Because what he does is  he gets shaky camera  footage like, oh my  God, I've got to get  this.  I think that's him.  You have to be in the  right place at the right  time.  Really?  Because around, it must  have been 11.15 or so,  he passes through, he goes  straight from out his door  through the lobby, down the  hall to the freight  elevator.  Right.  And if you're in that  area, but like, wow,  that's exciting.  If you're in that area at  that time, huh?  One of my friends has 
[01:05:00]  been here for two years  and she's never seen him  before.  She works right down the  hall, right outside our  office.  She's been here two years.  She's never seen him.  But he'll make believe he's  part of this company.  I'm Loch Ness Howie.  Can we get shaky video of  him?  I want to push it out to  the media.  Chris Stern.  That's so fucking weird.  But no sightings, Robin. 
[01:05:30]  I saw somebody trying to  take a plastic cast of my  footprint, Robin.  That's really funny.  A big plastic cast.  We think this is where he  came out of his studio.  We've taken plastic cast and  Oh my God.  Whatever.  One more thing.  Is there anything worse than  I'm a Yeti?  Is there anything worse when  you're at this facility and 
[01:06:00]  there's some dope running  down the hall with a script  heading into a studio?  What could be so important on  that piece of paper?  Very important.  I've never seen that.  Oh, just keep your eyes  open.  Okay.  Someone in a hurry with a  script.  I've got to get on the air.  Well, most shows have to  have scripts and stuff  pre-written.  Right.  Because otherwise, what  would management approve  before they go on the air?  What would management  approve?  All right. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  We'll take our first break.  and we'll get into some  stuff.  Actually, Steve, by the way,  is letting his hair poof out  the sides of his hat.  I can't really say anything  about that.  I'm in dire need of a  haircut.  Doesn't matter.  Not as bad as he is.  I got red eye on Thursday,  so I think I'm having a  haircut.  I have it Wednesday.  Really?  I do.  I have us on there together  one day.  I would love that, but they  call me to stay on TV  motherfucking kid.  That's what they call me. 
[01:07:00]  Motherfucking kid.  That's the graphic they  use?  Yeah.  This stays on TV,  motherfucking kid.  Oh, yeah, Hannity the 26  too.  He doesn't bump me.  Can I turn people on to my  toadly-doo video?  Yeah, the toadly-doo is  pretty good.  Where was that?  Times Square?  Times Square, actually, on  Saturday, I was in Times  Square.  I actually took Sam and his  lovely girl out to dinner, 
[01:07:30]  and then Sam's like, you  want to come up and watch  Special Delivery?  I'm like, no, I don't want  to be in that facility if I  don't have to.  It was a good show.  It was a good show.  Good.  I didn't get to hear it.  Whatever.  But afterwards, I'm walking  through Times Square and  there's a toadly-doo guy, so  I was toadly-doing as he  was toadly-doing as well.  He had like a pan flute.  He was like Zamfear.  Right.  It's on my YouTube channel,  OP Radio, but it made  Anthony laugh, which made  me very happy.  Yeah, it was very good.  Right there, the top one.  Because you are completely 
[01:08:00]  annoying, this idiot.  Just so you know, I'm no  more than five feet in front  of his face.  Toadly-doo, toadly-doo, toadly-doo.  Yelling totally, do it, my guy.  I hate you.  Oh, toadly-doo, toadly-doo. 
[01:08:30]  Toadly-doo, toadly-doo.  I was annoyed.  Toadly-doo, toadly-doo.  You see the look he gave me?  I'm trying to earn a living here.  Yeah, he's blowing into  fucking husks to make rent money  and you're toadly-doing  with a fucking camera.  He's got a mullet.  No joke, five feet.  Maybe closer.  Because I want to make sure  I got all the audio right.  So fucking annoyed. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, did he have to be annoyed?  Toadly-doo, toadly-doo, toadly-doo.  Want to go down and do one?  They're in Times Square all day long.  You should bring your slide whistle  and we'll like...  Ah, jam, jam with him.  We'll set up a camp right next to him.  Jam.  All right, I don't know if we got  anything accomplished  with this first break,  but it was fun for us.  You did.  We'll get into some other things  after the break.  You know what I noticed about  when I started the whole thing off?  Is this a tease?  No, talking about porno. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And watching a lot of porno last night.  Now when I'm looking at girls  on TV like this,  all I'm looking at is like tits  and ass and thinking  what they look like naked.  Now, I normally would anyway.  Yeah.  But now it's really like prevalent.  I'm like, all right,  let me see what that would...  Look at that.  Yeah, she got a little  secretary spread going there.  Like right there.  I'd be like, all right,  I think I know what those titties look like.  Is there anything better  than the arching of the back?  Oh, my God. 
[01:10:00]  It cures a world of hurt.  Oh, my God.  It cures everything.  Yeah.  Now they're doing push-ups  on the sidewalk outside.  It's planking.  Almost planking.  I did a little planking last night  after my 10 rounds  on the heavy bag.  I plank.  It's fucking hard, man.  I'll plank with you.  You do a side plank, motherfucker?  Are you a side plank, motherfucker?  I usually do it around the world,  which is you plank  all both sides.  Yeah.  But I just did a little  straight planking last night.  Straight planking.  I was doing some cranking.  Do you do the side cranking?  Any kind of crank I need.  Holy shit, John. 
[01:10:30]  I fucking love you.  Keith Oberman.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You're thanking Keith Oberman?  No.  I've decided that this year  I need to become  a football fan again.  I'll be honest.  The last couple years  it kind of faded out.  Didn't see a lot of games.  And my Jets...  But this year I just feel like  I really want to watch  a lot of football,  a lot of highlights.  I'm all in it.  For real.  The Jets look good so far.  Even if the Jets are a bust,  that's okay.  I'm in this year. 
[01:11:00]  You're in.  I'm so in.  So this Sunday night football thing  they do with Keith Oberman,  it's unbelievable.  Watchable.  Really?  Fucking John in Georgia.  John.  Hey, yeah.  He makes jokes  that he has absolutely  no confidence in  and they're horrible  to begin with.  Didn't he do a plucking,  a keep plucking  that chicken joke  or something?  If we could find that,  that would be great.  I think so.  But he also made a comment  with Johnny Knox from Chicago  and his exact delivery was  Johnny Knox trying to make 
[01:11:30]  Chicago Johnny Knox.  Oh, yeah.  What happened there?  Clearly delivered like that  with no confidence.  Can we hear some of the audience?  Now, here's the history  of Keith Oberman.  He was on ESPN  and I really did like him  on ESPN way back.  And then this MSNBC show  he does  and how he spoke up  about Imus  after Imus got fired,  that was the turning point  in me.  I'm like,  this guy's a douchebag.  He had every opportunity  to say what he wanted to  about Imus  before Imus got fired.  He wasn't brave.  He was brave behind the scenes 
[01:12:00]  and then he was brave  when he knew that  Imus couldn't hurt him anymore.  He's a company man, yeah.  And now I fucking hate the guy.  Yeah.  And it's not even about  his politics  because I probably lean more  toward a Keith Oberman  than a Sean Hannity.  Probably.  But he's just a douche  of a guy.  And now they decided  they want to do  this football thing  with him every Sunday  on NBC.  Yeah.  So he's the guy  doing all the highlights  and it's like,  I don't want to listen  to Keith Oberman.  Well, now you have to  if you want to catch that.  Well, if the guy  could get some highlights  to Oberman  because it is horrendous 
[01:12:30]  and some people comparing it  to like John Sterling crap.  Like douchey over the top.  You know, he's trying  to make it about himself  a little bit  and whatnot.  It's not about you, douchebag.  I'm so glad  that guy brought that up.  I was just thinking  about that last night.  I'm like, oh,  I have to sit through him  if I want to see highlights.  Break time?  Okay.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony,  stay there.  Opie and Anthony  on a Monday.  We'll get through this.  Yeah.  Meh.  Well.  Your number one movie 
[01:13:00]  was Cloudy  with a Chance of Meatballs.  Ah, that's that  animation, right?  Animation.  I like the animations.  I'm going to have  to see that one.  Yeah.  Nine looks good, too.  Nine?  What's that?  Nine?  Nine?  That's the one  who the hell's in charge  of that fucking movie?  Oh, I don't know.  What?  What's the matter, Travis?  Tim Burton, right?  Is it Tim Burton?  I think he produced it.  Oh, he produced it, yeah, yeah.  What is Nine about? 
[01:13:30]  I don't think I've heard anything about this.  It looks very post-apocalyptic  kind of animation thingy,  like, you know,  you know, like he does.  Yeah, it looks like a Tim Burton flick.  Nightmare Before Christmas  kind of thing.  Oh, wow, look at that.  Only it looks pretty cool.  Nine official trailer on YouTube  if you want to play along.  Right on, man.  Look at that.  It looks good, and of course,  there's...  They figured out that animation thing, huh?  Yeah, it's pretty good.  Except for...  There's some survivors, and then...  You know where they haven't figured it out, Ant?  Where? 
[01:14:00]  Tiger Woods 10.  Drives me fucking nuts  how bad the graphics are.  Yeah.  Gameplay, terrific.  Graphics, suck a dick.  Yeah, they should have better graphics  on that one.  Look at John Madden.  Let's do the John Madden thing  with the Tiger Woods thing.  Damn.  End of story.  It's all in texturing and lighting.  Yeah, how about that?  Yeah.  Looks great.  Look at that.  Yeah, that looks good.  Anthony, what about the informant?  Kind of a bust.  Claudia with the Chance of Meatballs,  $30 million.  The informant, $10 million. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  I think they wanted a little more money  from the informant.  Maybe they did.  I think they're hoping for DVDs.  And then a movie we were all over last week,  and man, I can't believe I haven't seen it yet  with all the conversations we had  about this movie.  Love Happens.  My God.  I don't know why I didn't go.  Love Happens.  Opening weekend.  I don't know why I didn't go.  Did you go and see Love Happens, Jimmy?  What's that?  Did you go and see Love Happens?  No.  No, no, no.  I was going to go, but it was...  Someone told me it was sold out.  Yeah. 
[01:15:00]  A lot of sold out shows.  Yeah.  It's too bad.  Sure is.  What did that make?  8.5.  So that's a bust.  Ooh, that's not good.  No, that's a bust.  Hopefully this, like, people start looking and going,  maybe these movies are, like, done.  Well, the problem is they put Jennifer Aniston  in these roles where she's finding love,  and in real life she's a bust with a smelly pussy, I think.  That's not.  Because...  Hold on. 
[01:15:30]  That was a complete nosedive away from...  People think she's good,  but I think that she's a bust with a smelly pussy.  Well, look.  Wow.  In real life,  we know that in real life Jennifer Aniston can't find a man,  and she desperately wants a man,  and she wants to have a kid and all that crap.  She's still trying to get over the Brad Pitt breakup,  even though Brad Pitt has moved on and had 10 kids since then.  Oh, my God.  But she's still fawning away for Brad Pitt.  Then she's seen a bunch of guys,  and no one wants to stay with her,  and you know what? 
[01:16:00]  She is pretty fucking hot.  She's pretty fine.  So then let's do the equation.  If she's really hot,  but no guy wants to be with her,  smelly pussy.  You think that's always what does it?  That's my guess.  Maybe she's got a bad attitude.  So now I'm thinking people don't want to see her  finding love in these movies  because it's not believable  because they know what...  They know she has a smelly pussy.  Yeah, they know the real Jennifer Aniston  is having a problem as far as that goes.  Come on. 
[01:16:30]  John Mayer was with her, right?  I think he was, yeah.  Yeah.  We should ask him, right?  Oh, well.  Remember when he used to do our show?  Yeah, I remember.  Another guy before he made the AA list.  Before he got huge.  He was huge,  but then he went to the next level.  Yeah, he went up to that level of never fuck it.  They wouldn't bring him past this studio.  No.  He used to do our show.  We used to have him on the phone.  Yeah, and he would have fun.  He'd goof about all the stupid, disgusting stuff.  I wonder if those guys, 
[01:17:00]  like John Mayer,  and there's a few others that we had  before they were really famous,  if they even remember our names anymore.  No.  Does that leave your brain, you think?  Yeah.  Because John Mayer knew who we were.  Did our show, called,  hey guys,  and would ask personal questions.  How you guys doing?  How you been?  Do you think he's completely forgot our names at this point?  Oh, yes.  I would.  So do I.  I would in a second.  So Love Happens is a bust at the theaters.  That's too bad.  Can I tell you something really annoying that happened to me on Friday? 
[01:17:30]  Are you mad?  Yes, but at my manager's company.  That fan Jerry who got me the Quincy picture.  Jerry!  Now Jerry.  He's a good fan.  He's a hardcore dude.  He meets everybody.  So he got Jack Klugman to sign a picture to Jim C.  Yes.  From Jack Klugman.  Jim C.  That rules.  So I think,  now Jonathan is OCD.  He wouldn't mail this.  I get it in the mail,  and it comes in a big padded envelope.  Signed photo, glass frame, 
[01:18:00]  a big padded envelope.  And I hear a,  Oh no, are you shitting me?  I don't want to attack anybody yet.  Because I don't know if it was his secretary,  or his secretary's assistant or somebody.  This is how they mailed.  Who would fucking put glass frame thing in a padded envelope?  A big padded envelope with a teeny bit of thin,  thin bubble wrap around the base of it. 
[01:18:30]  Not even around the whole picture.  And the rest of the picture was wrapped in a sweatshirt.  Which, by the way, was from Furry Vengeance,  the movie I did.  They sent me a sweatshirt,  which got ruined because it was covered in fucking broken glass.  So they fucked me out of the picture.  The picture I saved,  it's got like little slices on it.  Oh, shit.  I was so...  And Jonathan was livid.  I mean, Jonathan didn't do it.  That sucks.  But I woke him up Saturday morning, actually,  and he's like,  I'm so fucking mad!  Woke his fiancee up. 
[01:19:00]  He was a hot Johnny.  He was fucking...  Well, he was mad because you woke him up?  No!  Oh, he was just mad for the situation?  Because of the selfishness and the carelessness of doing that.  Yeah.  That's almost aggressive.  Like, no one could be that stupid.  Yeah, how do you put that in?  An autographed photo...  That's incompetent.  ...in a glass frame by a guy who's going to probably die soon.  I mean, he's an old guy, Jack Hunter.  Yeah, you can't say get another one.  I'm fucking legend.  You're not going to get another Jim C.  I still have it.  I mean, it's just a little scratched up.  I was so irritated.  You'll be okay with the scratch.  She was like Lucy with the John Wayne footprints. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, oh.  I want to be in on this reference.  Remember at Brownman's Chinese Theater?  What did she do?  She kept breaking them and fucking them up.  I don't remember.  And little Ricky was smearing them around, a little shit.  And then, you know, he finally made up like five of them.  I don't remember.  That's what Jim C's got to do.  What Quincy's got to do is make up five Jim C ones just in case they get broken.  I Love Lucy.  They have a box set for that act?  Yes, they do.  All right, I got to pick that up.  Big red box.  Oh, no.  I'm missing the obvious. 
[01:20:00]  Jennifer Aniston doesn't suck the dick.  That's what everybody's saying, and that's why she can't keep a man.  I don't know.  I doubt it, man.  She looks like she's a dirty girl.  What's her problem?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I bet you.  Maybe she's too clingy, or maybe she needs too much love.  I mean, who knows?  Sometimes women just, they want to hug you too much.  They want too much of your love, and I don't know.  There's only one way you find that out, and that's by fucking going out with her.  Yeah.  You go out with her, you figure it out, and go, okay, now I see.  Yeah.  Maybe she is.  Maybe she's like one of these, oh, my biological clock. 
[01:20:30]  Boo.  Break time?  Oh.  I just saw a sign that said break time.  Google bomb.  Jennifer Aniston has a smelly pussy.  I don't think they'd go for that one.  They will never allow that one.  I was up all night, and I was cranky this morning, and my girlfriend's sleeping.  So I'm going back in between the bathroom and the living room trying to be quiet. 
[01:21:00]  And I walked in, and she was kind of cranky because the fucking lights were on.  What did she say?  Turn the fucking lights off?  She's like, could you not leave the light on?  I'm like, I'm just kind of running back and forth.  So I'm in the, two minutes later, I'm in my fucking living room.  And she walks out and goes, what the fuck?  You're doing what I just told you not to do.  Wait, what?  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  And I was, and I actually said, excuse me?  I thought it was a sketch.  And you were in a bad mood to begin with.  I am not.  This didn't help the mood, huh, Jimmy?  In a good place.  So I walk, and she starts scolding me.  And she goes, I fucking told you to keep the eyes off my face.  Like, instead of the light out of my eyes.  So I just, I was going to either throw my computer out the window or make fun of her. 
[01:22:00]  So I made fun of her.  Because I'm like, I'm sorry, are the eyes on your face?  And then she just walked into the bedroom, fuming.  Because there's no way to recover.  No.  Because I told you to keep the eyes off my face.  Eyes off my face.  So then, I had to, because I could feel rage coming up, I had to fucking, I had to just  annoy her.  Because I didn't want to yell.  But you know what annoys a girl when they're trying to sleep, besides keeping the lights  on that they've asked you to turn off?  Rubbing your penis in their ass crack?  That probably wouldn't have annoyed her.  Oh, okay.  As much as the fun snap walk. 
[01:22:30]  Women hate.  What is that?  Okay.  Oh, that's, that's when you walk around the entire house like this.  Oh, my God.  No, you aren't doing that.  What is wrong with you?  It's this little hoppy walk.  Yeah.  Where he's just snapping his fingers.  And I'm sure on wood floors, it's just horrendous.  Wow.  It was fucking, like, it was, she was so aggravated.  That would be really aggravating.  At the snap walk. 
[01:23:00]  At the snap walk.  That's what I had to deal with.  Oh, my God.  I had to, I had to gingerly snap walk around my apartment just to keep my mood light.  Snap walk.  Are you guys in a fight?  It would have been a lot worse if I had not been snap walking.  Snap walking saved a tremendous argument, because it kind of cooled me down a little.  Oh, but it must have gotten her pissed.  Fuming.  She came out yelling at me, but I just told her, look, you're being awful.  Right.  All right.  We're going to Google bomb.  See, that could be the Jennifer Aniston syndrome right there. 
[01:23:30]  Why?  You know what I mean?  Well, you know.  Can I tell people who you're pointing at?  On the outside, it looks very good, and, and, you know, there's something cool there,  and you think, all right, a little bit of celebrity, do this.  And then once you go out with that person, you realize, hmm.  Something's not right here.  A little clingy.  Really?  A little clingy.  A little, I need to get married and have kids, and, and you're like, wow, Jesus, come  on, hold on.  And all you want to do is stick it in our hiney. 
[01:24:00]  Ah, anywhere.  You know, it's fine.  Oh, look how cute.  Hey, can we Google bomb?  How did that ever happen?  But you look like you're in love.  Wow.  Well, that person looks like he's in love.  What?  No, I was drunk.  Or hungover.  Yeah, I think I was drunk.  It's the same look.  The love look and the hungover look is pretty much the same.  I'd put that hat on eBay.  What's the J stand for?  Jerk.  Jerk.  Jerk.  Jerk.  Anthony's a jerk, jackass. 
[01:24:30]  Just simple.  Jerk.  How about we Google bomb?  Thank you, Thomas Overbeck from Dallas.  How about them cowboys, huh?  Jennifer Aniston needs vinegar.  Vinegar?  Oh.  I don't know if we could Google bomb anymore.  I think they're onto us.  We had a good run, though.  We could try it.  Jennifer Aniston needs vinegar.  Hmm.  We could try that one today.  Uh, let's say hi to Richie in Maryland.  Richie.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Um, you know, me, uh, that Jennifer Aniston is crazy pussy. 
[01:25:00]  You can just look at her face, and you can imagine the smile that she has turning into  a psychotic rage.  I think that she's crazy pussy.  Crazy?  That's just my opinion.  What's wrong with crazy pussy, though?  Uh, dude, I'm married to crazy pussy.  My wife actually looks a lot like Jennifer Aniston, and my wife, as much as I love her,  she's crazy.  She's psycho, like you were saying about clingy.  It's much more than that. 
[01:25:30]  Welcome to the fucking club of guys that go out with any girl.  Jesus.  Your wife looks like Jennifer Aniston, but she's not bringing $10 million a picture home now,  is she?  I'm not saying that she's Jennifer Aniston.  You're fucking right, man.  If it was Jennifer, I could deal with a lot of shit to be with Jennifer Aniston, but the  point is, I bet you that she's like the fucking jealous type, insecure, you know, especially  after getting beat down by fucking Brad Pitt.  You know that she's got to be super, super insecure, no matter how hot she is. 
[01:26:00]  I guarantee she's fucking insecure psycho.  Right on.  All right.  She's got crazy pussy, eh?  Crazy pussy.  All right.  Thank you, Richie.  Hey, you guys heard about Wolf Blitzer, right?  The guy that does The Situation Room?  The Situation Room.  Turns out he's a dummy.  Oh.  Man, when you see like CNN and The Situation Room, you think the host has got to be really  informed and knowledgeable about what the situation is.  Well, he went on Celebrity Jeopardy. 
[01:26:30]  A lot of people have heard this by now or heard about this.  Uh, he lost to Andy Richter.  39,002.  Ready for this?  Minus 4,600 for Wolf Blitzer.  Minus 4,600?  Wolf Blitzer was a bust on Jeopardy.  Wow.  What a dunce.  And we got a montage of Wolf Blitzer being a bust on Jeopardy.  You want to hear this?  Yeah.  He seems like an absolute dope.  Let's hear.  You're not a fan of The Situation Room, Jimmy?  No, I don't like music beds under fucking news programs. 
[01:27:00]  I don't.  No.  Are we going to get the questions?  I don't know.  Let's see.  I don't know.  Can we stop after the question?  I want to see if we know the answer.  I definitely do.  Here's the host of The Situation Room.  Stop it.  Alex Trebek.  I said it, too.  Got to ring in.  Who is Alex Trebek?  Ha ha.  Form of a question.  The answer would be Wolf Blitzer.  Oh.  Because he says the host of The Situation Room.  Damn it.  Oh.  Hey, the morning mashups.  Welcome back down the hall.  What's today's question?  Want to ask if they were privy to seeing Oprah?  Yeah. 
[01:27:30]  Emmys.  What do you want to ask them?  We've got to ask them a question.  Ask them at Oprah.  I like that.  No, they probably weren't here for that because they do.  Yeah, but they might have hung out.  Open the door.  Kenny?  What do you want to ask them?  Something pop culture-y.  You can ask them if.  Let's open the door.  Kenny, what is.  All right, Jimmy, you ask them a question.  Hi, guys.  What's up, Jimmy?  How are you?  Hi.  Hi, morning mashup.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello, Opie and A.  Hello, yeah.  Hey, the morning mashup with all this energy and excitement. 
[01:28:00]  I know.  What are you guys talking about on your show today?  You know what?  I'm not sure yet.  I have to go back and look at the schedule.  I'm not really sure.  It's Monday.  You can't ask me such difficult questions.  It's a weird Monday, right?  There's not much going on out there in the pop culture world.  You watch the Emmys?  I did a little bit.  A little bit of it.  I thought Neil Patrick Harris was very cute.  He's gay.  But he just did a good job and he was sweet on stage.  He's going to be gay and cute.  I guess.  There's nothing wrong with that.  What's the question of the day?  There's nothing going on at all.  I don't know what the question of the day is. 
[01:28:30]  Did you see Oprah when she was here?  Oh, yeah.  Did you see her on Friday?  No, but I heard that you were not supposed to look at her.  Yeah.  And you had to address her as Miss Winfrey.  I actually saw it.  You're kidding, right?  No.  I saw her out on the street when she got in her car and the people walking by were trying  to get pictures and she was really nice to them, but there was three or four people standing  out on the sidewalk crying after they saw her.  They saw her and burst into tears.  Wait.  Like you would as if you saw Jesus.  Yeah, exactly.  Wait, but I'm sure that wasn't Oprah's directive, make them call me Miss Winfrey.  She seems like she's a little more down to earth. 
[01:29:00]  How did you hear that you weren't supposed to look at her?  No, I bet.  You had to call her Miss Winfrey.  I talked to the talent department that booked her and they said there were all these rules  and they said it wasn't just her people.  This is her.  She's a little nuts on her.  Yeah, you want to see the color purple?  Come on.  Miss Winfrey, motherfucker.  You got that from the color purple?  I kind of got that vibe.  But why wouldn't everyone works in the same radio company if she walks in?  Hi, Oprah.  The show's not called Miss Winfrey.  Like we're all on equal footing, are you saying? 
[01:29:30]  Note the craziest part.  It's her channel and it's probably a struggle to get her to fucking appear on her own channel.  Imagine if like, hey, the virus, the Opie and Anthony channel, but we're not going to be on it.  Well, it is a struggle to get us to show on.  Rich, watch your mouth, please.  You're representing the mass show.  Oh, Kenny.  Thank you, Kenny.  I was ready to slap him upside his neck.  He's like a shock jock.  Yes, he becomes a little potty mouth in here.  Yes, he does.  So they said that you have to address her as Miss...  And this drives me nuts. 
[01:30:00]  Like, don't look at her?  Don't look at her or you'll turn to stone.  But the talent department said don't look at Oprah?  Don't get me in trouble now.  Why?  It's fair.  If they said that, that's not a secret.  If that was directly...  You want to look at her, dude?  I would stare at Oprah.  I mean, yeah, why not?  I'd make little eyes at her.  Don't have me stand here messing with Oprah, Rich, because I'll give you a beat down right  now.  You like the Oprah, Stanley?  Huh?  You like Oprah?  I like you guys.  All right.  Miss Winfrey.  I like Oprah.  Yes.  Stand never makes sense.  We've got to get back to doing nothing.  See you guys.  See you guys later. 
[01:30:30]  O&A.  Take it easy.  Morning mashup.  Can you imagine them having the audacity to tell other adults how to address a radio  host?  And again, look, the biggest celebrity in the country.  But can you imagine the fucking audacity to say to other employees?  They don't say when Mel comes down to call him Mr. Carmerson.  And he can go, hello, Mel.  No, you don't look at him and go, don't go.  You understand what I'm saying?  It's like, there's no reason for that.  No, there's no reason.  She's known as Oprah. 
[01:31:00]  She's known as Oprah.  Everyone knows her as Oprah.  Oh my God, it's Oprah.  Yeah.  That's like having to call Cher Mrs.  What?  Miss Er.  What's her last name?  Sheckler.  Almond?  Cher Sheckler.  Cher Sheckler.  She's one of those one-namers.  Yeah.  She doesn't have a last name officially.  Not at all.  There's only a few of those out there.  Madonna, Prince, Cher.  Call her Miss Winfrey.  God, that's going to irritate me all.  Like, wow.  Miss Winfrey. 
[01:31:30]  Oprah, if you're nasty.  No?  Wow, this is a weird vibe today, man.  I love it.  That's just my vibe.  I love this weird vibe.  First of all, nobody would be disrespectful to Oprah.  When she came in, people would go, hi, Oprah.  That's what everyone...  Her magazine is fucking O Magazine.  Her company is Harpo.  That's Oprah backwards.  Holy shit.  Is it really?  See what I'm saying?  See what I'm saying?  You know, everything, man.  I love we got the morning mashup to kind of do a little trashing. 
[01:32:00]  Love it.  Call her Miss Winfrey.  Love it.  Because it's on everyone's mind how ridiculous things are at times.  Just completely ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  I know.  I can only imagine what you're reading right now.  Steve Rambasdor always has a great one that can never, ever be read on the air, but it  always makes me laugh.  If guys had disrespected Oprah, they would have been sent to...  That's very funny. 
[01:32:30]  Steve, you're a card.  All right, so back to Wolf Blitzer.  And a bunch of people saying, look, Andy Richter's a smart guy.  All right.  Sure he is.  But Wolf Blitzer should be a smart guy if he's doing the Situation Room every day.  Exactly.  And it's not a competition of this guy's smarter than me, so I lost.  It's kind of a competition against the buzzer and yourself.  Do you know the answer?  Right.  That's ridiculous. 
[01:33:00]  Here's the host of the Situation Room, journalist Wolf Blitzer.  The name of this pasta, similar to Penny, means little mustaches.  Little mustaches.  Oh.  Pasta.  It's not bow tie pastas.  Oh.  Okay.  I would say ZT.  No.  No.  It has to be the little half circles, like. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  No?  They're called...  Isn't that a video fucking thing?  Isn't that the pasta they're fucking addressing?  They show them the...  It's fucking ZT, motherfucker.  They're called little mustachios.  Wait a minute.  He didn't get ZT as they're showing...  I don't know.  Everyone knows that's ZT.  It might not be ZT.  It might be like Penny.  It might be fucking...  Nope.  Uh, uh, rigatoni.  It might be, um...  No.  That's ZT.  What is a bowl?  No. 
[01:34:00]  Little mustaches.  Doesn't sound so tasty now.  What are Hitler's?  Wolf.  What is fettuccine?  Nope.  Fettuccine is the worst answer.  Fettuccine is a fucking, like, a spaghetti type thing.  Right.  Everyone knows that.  Not a macaroni.  Oh, macaroni.  Shit, that's it.  Mustache, macaroni, macaroni being small, or eaty, or...  I'm saying macaroni.  It's gotta be.  It's not it.  Look. 
[01:34:30]  Nope.  Little mustachios is my answer.  I'm sticking with it.  Mustache sounds like macaroni.  I say macaroni.  I'm going with, what is macaroni?  Okay.  Uh, wait.  I gotta go to Brett in, uh, Nevada.  All right.  I like the weird vibe this show has today.  Brett?  Yeah?  Hi, Brett.  Hi.  What's up, Brett?  How's it going?  All right.  Yeah, no.  What I was saying is, uh, how you guys are talking about Oprah and the way that she wants 
[01:35:00]  to be addressed as Miss Winfrey and shit.  But I used to work at the Rose Garden Arena in Oregon, and Prince, he was really crazy  about that.  You would have to turn your back to him when he was coming, walking down the backstage,  and you weren't allowed to address him in any manner.  You weren't allowed to look at him.  Your head had to be down.  It was pretty crazy.  His own people, we'd have to go get, uh, supplies for his room.  His own people would have to, uh, bring it to him. 
[01:35:30]  Ugh.  That's why I really, most celebrities...  Look, Ant and I looked at the Dalai Lama right in his eyes.  If we could do that, then you could look at Oprah and say, hey, Oprah, and whatnot, right?  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Thank you, Brett.  I know what the answer is, and this is terrible because it was served at Chicago Pizza Pub,  where I used to work, and now I know what it is, and it's not macaroni, and it's not ziti.  Is it mustachios?  It sounds like that. 
[01:36:00]  It's so good, too.  It was served up in this fucking parmesan and...  Oh, like my mother used to make the mustache pasta melt in your mouth.  Oh, make you want to wear it home.  Oh, actually, she'd make it al dente.  Oh, it was, uh...  Well, al dente means to the tooth.  To the tooth.  Shut up.  What's that fucking wop?  Cares about the glory days and that fucking monster that pumps you out of her box.  That's it.  That's it.  Color to penny means little mustaches. 
[01:36:30]  Penny?  Doesn't sound so tasty now.  Wolf.  What is fettuccine?  Stupid.  King David and Jesus both hailed from this town.  We only have...  Oh, we're only on the nose.  That was mustacholi.  I wouldn't fucking get that.  It sounds like mustache and little thing.  King David and Jesus were both from this town?  I would say Nazareth.  Well, he was Jesus of Nazareth.  Jerusalem. 
[01:37:00]  No, I would say...  It has to be Nazareth.  No, it's not Nazareth.  That's where he went to.  Because where he was actually from, where King David was from, was East Brunswick, New Jersey.  Oh.  A lot of people don't know that.  Elbow pasta.  I like elbow pasta, too, Matt G. in Jersey.  All right.  King David and Jesus both hailed from this town.  Bethlehem.  Wolf.  What is Jerusalem?  No.  An accused person in court, along with his counsel.  Wolf. 
[01:37:30]  But as a defendant.  No.  From a larger work.  Wolf.  Annotated?  No.  Add one of this five-letter word that refers to an economic crash and the fear-driven rush to sell.  Wolf.  What is a crash?  No.  Wolf, things have not worked out as well as you had hoped for, I'm sure.  Andy is so much faster on that signaling device today.  But it's long been our policy on Celebrity Jeopardy that all contestants get to play in the final round. 
[01:38:00]  And so even though you're at minus 4,600 now, we're going to wipe that out.  Oh.  And give you an even thousand dollars so you get to play in Final Jeopardy as well.  Oh, charity.  You fucking stink, Wolf.  Wow.  You fucking blow.  Thanks for nothing.  You fucking fuck that up.  What an asshole.  I like hearing Alex going, no.  No.  No.  Nope.  No.  No.  Incorrect.  No.  No.  No.  Moron.  He got his balls kicked in. 
[01:38:30]  A fucking TV talk show guy.  All he does is read the news.  That's it.  He just reads.  Doesn't get out that Jesus and David come up much.  That's true.  Yeah, he's just a reader.  In the end, they're all just readers.  That's what Jeopardy is all about is knowing shit that, you know, most people don't know.  Not really?  Come on.  Yeah, come on.  If I can answer some of the questions, then.  Jeopardy is harder than any other question-based game show.  No, it's not.  Cash Cab is harder.  Cash Cab is fucking hard, dude.  I watched that and I didn't get one question.  Cash Cab is the easiest fucking game ever. 
[01:39:00]  Cash Cab is pretty easy, Jimmy.  Ever.  Bullshit.  Ever.  I think Jeopardy is way harder than that.  Yeah, you guys can both jump in a lake.  Fucking Snoop's here.  Holy shit.  Oh, damn, yo.  That's not Snoop.  Oh.  Who's this tall drink of water?  Don't look too closely.  It's Kenny.  You'll be in Human Resources by 10 o'clock.  Yeah, look.  What does she do here?  Who's this?  What do you do here?  What do you do?  What is that? 
[01:39:30]  She's all mad now.  We're just looking at her.  Oh, we're in trouble.  What she does.  We're in trouble.  Ugh.  Uh, Obama reportedly...  What does CNN stand for?  Ugh.  I'll throw out some fucking racial epithets and sexual.  I can't...  You're the political guy.  Uh, oh, yes, yes.  Why is Obama telling Governor Patterson...  Yeah.  Uh, to stay out of the race? 
[01:40:00]  The 2010 race.  Yes, for governor.  For the governor of New York.  And Patterson's saying, uh, go fuck yourself.  He goes, I said I'm running, and I'm running for fucking governor.  He wants a full term as governor.  He took over because he was lieutenant governor.  He took over for Elliot Spitzer.  Yep.  Who tripped over his own dick and, uh, got thrown out of office.  But, uh, Obama and the rest of the, uh, Dems really don't want him running because his  approval rating is in the shithole.  Why is it in the shithole?  Because he's done a shitty job of being governor of New York. 
[01:40:30]  He's done a shithole job.  And, uh...  Was Elliot Spitzer doing a good job for New York?  He wasn't even in long enough to figure it out.  Yeah.  Has Governor Patterson been in longer than Elliot Spitzer?  Yeah.  At this point?  Yeah.  Really?  Absolutely.  Huh.  Okay.  And, um, they're worried now that a Republican contender is going to be able to win easily.  And the rumor has it that that Republican contender, Rudy Giuliani, who, by the way, I think would 
[01:41:00]  really clean up in New York.  Thanks for the zoomed in picture of Patterson, you googly-eyed motherfucker.  Holy shit.  Look over here, Gov.  You just think Blazing Saddles every time, right?  I know.  Right?  With that ball...  What is that thing called?  The ball on the paddle with the fucking string attached?  Pass these out to the guys in lieu of pay and other things.  Yeah, so, uh, they're saying if Rudy Giuliani runs, uh, Patterson doesn't have a chance, and 
[01:41:30]  they'll lose New York to the Republicans as far as, uh, the governor goes, so they want  to get him out and run, uh, a Democrat that could possibly win.  And who's the Democrat?  I don't know.  I don't know if they've even come up with a name yet.  It says a poll last week showed that 70% of New Yorkers, including 65% of...  Maybe that Cuomo Jr. guy, that, uh, Andrew Cuomo.  Yeah.  That's what I was going to say before Daniel typed it very quickly. 
[01:42:00]  Um, a poll last week showed that 70% of New Yorkers, including 65% of his fellow Democrats,  don't want Patterson to run for election.  No, they don't want him.  Because he stinks.  Yeah.  He stinks.  Well, we don't know why he stinks.  What has he done?  He's...  What has he done wrong, even?  Another taxed, taxed the shit out of everybody.  Uh, he couldn't even control, um, the, the, uh, his underlings as far as the rest of the  political machine goes in New York.  They were rebelling against him. 
[01:42:30]  If you remember, a few Democrats actually defected over to the Republican side just  to fuck him over.  There's no unity behind him.  He's just not liked.  He's not a liked governor and he can't really work with people.  And, and to be a, an effective governor, you gotta be able to work with at least, uh, at  least the people in your own state.  Nevermind fucking going to Washington and trying to get resources for the state.  The guy isn't really liked.  How does he even get to Washington?  I know.  I want fucking Giuliani to be the governor so bad. 
[01:43:00]  Dude, to have a, a, a good, a governor like Rudy Giuliani in there, nice Republican to,  to fucking look over this Democratic fucking state we're in.  I want that dumb Bloomberg out too.  Well, he's not going to be out.  That's for sure.  He's got, I don't think he's going to win another election.  That fucking, he's winning.  He's absolutely fucking winning.  He's done a great job in New York City.  He's got too much money to lose.  Mm-hmm.  He's got more money than God.  He really does. 
[01:43:30]  He's got a lot of fucking money.  He can be on TV all the time.  Uh, and that's what does it.  And then if we're talking about politics anyway, I gotta throw in stupid fucking Carolyn  McCarthy.  Carolyn McCarthy is, um, she's some kind of rep in fucking out on Long Island.  Well, she lost her husband and then she became a politician.  No, she didn't lost him.  Lose him.  She knows where he is.  Dead!  The guy, the guy fucking got shot.  On the Long Island Railroad.  On the Long Island Railroad by, uh, a savage by the name of Colin Ferguson. 
[01:44:00]  Shot her husband and her son.  I believe her son lived, but it was a very injured.  And the husband died.  And then she went on this tear to become a politician out of nowhere.  She was a housewife.  And her huge stand was complete anti-gun.  That was her platform.  She knew nothing else about anything to do with politics.  But she got a sympathy vote because her husband, uh, was killed. 
[01:44:30]  And her son was shot by this animal on the Long Island Railroad.  The Long Island Railroad gunman.  And she won.  She won.  And she's been in there for a while now.  I don't know what else she does, uh, to tell you the truth.  But I know what her gun stance is.  And it's not good for legal gun owners.  Now, they have this, uh, bill.  That's, uh, hello, bill.  That's, uh, up for vote.  About whether people should be able to carry their legal, licensed firearms on Amtrak trains. 
[01:45:00]  Now, if you're taking Amtrak and you're going from point A to point B,  and they both allow, your point A and your point B allow you to have a gun,  you should be able to travel.  Uh, they do that.  You could actually check, uh, your pistol in your checked luggage on an airplane.  As long as you, uh, tell them you have it.  Yeah, most people know that.  So, with the Amtrak thing, are, do you check your gun,  or you're sitting in your seat with your gun?  That's debatable. 
[01:45:30]  Uh, I believe it's checked.  Checked?  So, what's the big deal?  Exactly.  I mean, what is the big deal?  Being a guy that does Amtrak every once in a while,  I mean, just because I don't have a gun,  that makes me a little nervous having a guy in your car with a gun on him.  I mean, you know, it's just human nature.  But, for me, it makes me nervous.  But if they're saying you could check the gun, who gives a shit?  But, uh, the thing is, they don't really have checked luggage a lot of times on Amtrak.  It's your carry-on.  Right, right.  So, it would be in your carry-on.  You would have to declare it.  Now, you have to tell them that you do indeed have a firearm, 
[01:46:00]  and they will check to make sure that you're licensed and everything.  If you want to take a gun in your checked bag on a plane,  you have to get there hours before.  Hours.  Sit there with the transit authority and go over the legality, where you're going,  if they allow, your license is allowed in that state.  I mean, it's a big fucking to-do.  That's really stupid, by the way.  Yeah.  Because if you're just checking the gun, then who cares?  Then who cares?  Then the airline is in control of your weapon. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, that's pretty much that.  So, why do you have to get there hours and hours ahead of time?  Well, this is part of, you know, the whole gun control thing.  Jump through hoops.  Yeah.  Although, maybe because somebody who works in baggage could work it out where they get that gun.  I mean, without the security precaution, where they get that gun to a food preparer who has access to the aircraft  or to a passenger, and then the gun is now in play.  It does have to be kept in a locked box in your suitcase, separate from the ammunition. 
[01:47:00]  Don't they?  That's what they say in the cockpit sometimes, too, don't they?  What?  The guns.  And the captain has to say, it's okay, or else it can't travel.  Well, yeah, that's probably another thing.  I would be sure.  But, no, they keep it in the checked luggage.  Ammo, separate.  But, you know, I mean, there hasn't been a case where people have taken over a plane with a gun that was in checked baggage.  So, what's the problem with this bill with Carolyn McCarthy?  Well, she thinks it's insane.  She goes, it would only open up the opportunity for more crazy people to be armed on a train. 
[01:47:30]  It's like, wait a minute.  What are you even talking about?  They're the legal gun owners.  Illegal gun owners will take a gun on a train.  They don't care about the law.  You think Colin Ferguson fucking cared about the law when he shot your husband and son?  And then maybe if somebody actually had a legal gun on that car, they could have shot Colin Ferguson before he got to your family.  Because he just went along the seats shooting people. 
[01:48:00]  So, instead, legislate again against legal gun owners.  Because it's worked so well as far as gun violence and crime goes.  It's just, it's infuriating to me.  I hate Carolyn McCarthy.  Yeah, vote her out, please.  Off.  Second Amendment.  It's being trotted, trotted upon.  I say, like Archie Bunker.  You hand out the heaters before you all get on a plane or the train. 
[01:48:30]  We got that clip.  And then you give it back at the end.  Because who's going to be crazy enough to pull out a rod when they know everyone's packing heat?  It was a great editorial he had.  And he was a hardcore liberal.  Oh, I know.  How the fuck did he do that every day?  He played it off great.  In the real world, he was a hardcore liberal but played the complete opposite on TV.  And people, they don't know any better.  They think that's really what he thinks. 
[01:49:00]  Hard-pressed to find a show for the first few seasons.  As funny as all in the family was.  Especially for the time back then.  Then they got just maudlin' and stupid.  I like the ones with Samantha the best.  Archie Bunker's place.  It wasn't even called All in the Family anymore.  It was just Archie at the bar.  And it would always end with some kind of tragedy where Archie's crying or some shit.  Shut up.  Good.  Edith's dead.  Is that where Stretch climbed up on the bar and fucked his face?  Yes.  Right by the fucking Pabst Blue Ribbon? 
[01:49:30]  Stretch and say, stop crying.  I'll challenge that statement, Anthony.  Yeah.  A little show called Mork and Mindy.  Mork and Mindy.  Hysterical from beginning to end.  Yes.  I hope it's a good point, though.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  It came in the big egg.  I enjoyed Mork from Ork when he was on Happy Days because the challenges between him and  Fonzie, where he froze Fonzie.  Fonzie couldn't do the thumb thing.  No, Fonzie.  At first he couldn't do it, though. 
[01:50:00]  Right, but he used the power of the A-thumb.  The power of the Fonz.  To get himself out of being alien frozen by Mork.  Fantastic moment.  Still gives me chills to this day.  When he got over Mork's power.  Yeah.  Did he actually fight Mork, though?  Why would he fight?  He never fought anybody.  Of course not.  Fonzie was a faggot.  My girlfriend had never knew what jumping the shark was.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and I told her it's a very common expression, and I showed her the scene.  No, you didn't.  I did. 
[01:50:30]  The jumping the shark scene.  Did she just want to fucking fall into the fetal position and cry?  She was just staring at it, and she goes, why is there so much buildup?  Like, no one thinks he's going to get eaten by a shark.  And no one cared.  She was right.  There's no tension around this.  No one cared.  He was wearing a leather jacket.  We were looking at the extras acting, like how awful the extras are.  Like, their reaction shots are just fucking terrible.  And didn't they do the slow motion thing when he finally went over the top?  Yeah, but his legs opened.  It was so fucking hard.  Like, oh, is he going to make it?  Is he going to make it?  There was a cliffhanger, too, if you remember. 
[01:51:00]  It's the worst music.  We had to wait a week to find out what happened to the Fonz.  Listen to the music they play.  The music's horrendous.  Where's the shark?  It's in a shark pen.  And why does he have to wear a leather jacket?  And why am I driving the boat?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jaws music.  Yeah, they're trying to tap into the Jaws thing, because I think it was around that  time, wasn't it?  Fonzie's holding on with one hand.  See, they went, da, da, da, da.  How terrible is this music? 
[01:51:30]  It's horrendous.  He has black socks.  He doesn't even know how to ski.  I'm heading for the ramp.  Are you sure you want to do it?  How could Fonzie hear that?  He's giving him a thumbs up.  Everything's a thumbs up.  Let's see the music.  Look at the extras.  This is so douchey.  I hate this.  Fonzie's.  Look at the extras on the hall.  They're smiling.  And there's a shark.  Oh, no, a shark.  Look at that shark, Fonz.  Yeah.  How could you accept the challenge?  It wasn't me.  It was you.  I know.  I know.  Ralph. 
[01:52:00]  I did like Ralph.  Oh, he's so funny.  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  Look at this buildup.  The cutting hams.  Come on, Fonzie.  You can do it.  Richie's awful striped shirt.  Why is Richie driving the boat?  Yeah.  Ready to make the jump.  Finally.  You know that would just scare the shit out of a shark?  And he would freak out.  Of course.  If you fell into the shark pen with skis.  And here he goes.  They'd be thinking of eating you.  Oh, my God.  Here he goes.  Watch his skis open. 
[01:52:30]  It's so stupid.  Oh, Fonzie.  Clumsy.  Did he make it?  I hope not.  Come on, Fonzie.  Make it.  Of course he made it.  Oh, he just made it.  Oh, that one's cheering.  Yay.  Richie's thumbs.  Give him the okay sign.  The music's right back to where it was when it was tense.  Fucking awful.  Awful.  This is...  The extras all running. 
[01:53:00]  Incredibly bad.  They couldn't have picked it better.  Did he ask Ron Howard about this one?  No, we should have.  We should have.  Next time.  Fonzie skis in.  Champagne.  His leather jacket.  I guess he knew how to ski a little bit, huh?  Of course.  There's a bunch of those shots for him.  How did they okay this script?  How did Fonzie just not say, no, I'm not doing that?  Shit.  Or Henry.  That is so fucking bad.  It's awful. 
[01:53:30]  It is so hard to sit there and watch that.  I hope whoever fucking scored that and put the music together, as soon as they were done,  walked out of the studio and was killed by a drunk driver.  Who plowed onto the studio lot.  Fucking pinned him against the wall at the end of Vice Squad.  You ever see Vice Squad?  Oh, yeah.  It's pinned up against the wall.  Great one.  Fucking Wingshauser.  Wingshauser.  That was such a quotable movie. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Blink your eyes, motherfucker, and you die in the dark.  It was a great line.  Love to say that to someone.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  Yeah.  And continue with more shit.  I'm hungry.  I've got to tinkle.  So do I.  I have to make a wee-wee.  All right.  Then let's take a break.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  Yeah, I should have got a laugh at that line.  What a line.  I said, then why am I driving the boat?  Fucking, he looks just like me.  It's creepy.  I look at Ron Howard, young Ron Howard. 
[01:54:30]  I'm like, what the fuck?  That's me.  Hey.  That's creepy.  Give him an okay sign.  Like you made it.  Thank God I don't look like Ron Howard now.  Wow.  I got a few hairs falling out, but nothing like that.  My God.  How does he go through life looking like that?  He went from, like, full head of hair to horseshoe bald.  He wears hats like no time, though.  He wears a hat really good, though.  He's one of the fucking most powerful guys in Hollywood.  He wore a fucking bedpan on his head, and people would respect him.  I see a little problem there. 
[01:55:00]  There's a problem starting even during Happy Day.  Early on, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, there's some...  His head had one of the worst ones, too.  He had a comb over that went in 18 different fucking directions.  But the difference is he was supposed to be bald.  He looks...  Was he?  He looks all right bald.  There are guys that look all right bald, and then there are the ones that look horrendous.  And Ron Howard is, unfortunately, a guy that wasn't supposed to be bald.  Jason Alexander looks fine bald.  He looks fine bald.  Because you only know I'm bald.  You ever see him on roles where they put the fake hair on him? 
[01:55:30]  He's like, oh, okay.  Bruce Willis looks fine bald.  Bruce Willis looks fine, too.  As long as you get good wigs like they use on Lost.  Yes.  Whoa.  They have bad wigs on Lost?  Fucking...  It's almost like it's an SNL sketch about Lost.  The wigs are so bad.  Maybe Rob Reiner comb over.  Put Rob Reiner comb over in there, and we'll see.  He was like...  Stivic.  He was bringing hair from the back, right?  Early on.  Yeah, yeah.  From the back and then go with a swoop.  He was borrowing hair from Edith. 
[01:56:00]  I'm just showing other people's comb-omers.  O-vers.  O-mers.  I cannot...  Comb-omers?  Comb-omer.  I can't even talk today.  Yeah, he was bringing from the back, the side.  Yeah.  And it looked like he had a full head of hair.  I hated him on that show.  Did you?  Oh, he was terrible.  Oh, I hated him.  And what a horrible actor.  Come on, Arch.  He was a really bad actor, Jimmy.  Oh, shut up.  There it is.  He was in one of the greatest shows, and I didn't like him on that show.  Okay.  I love him. 
[01:56:30]  This is a perfect example of his comb-omers.  Look at where it's coming from.  From the back, and then he swoops it to the side.  He brushes it from the back all the way up front, and then swoops it to the side and  the front.  Giving it kind of a Hitler look to it.  Because right there, he's fucking bald.  He played a great liberal, though, like a great, frustrated guy.  I thought he was really good.  A liberal.  I don't like his acting.  I'm with Anne on that.  Okay.  What a great show, though.  He was so irritating.  You wanted fucking, you actually rooted for Archie to crush him.  Do I have fucking, I got all in the family at home?  I got all in the family at home. 
[01:57:00]  Do you?  Yeah, I got to watch some more of those.  Only the early ones, though.  Boy, you get past a few years, they just get stupid.  They ran out of ideas.  They got a little, I think Archie became too much of a popular character to be as abrasive  racially as he was in the earlier episodes.  Yeah.  And they started being like, eh, you know, you got to calm it down, maybe.  What was the season for, uh...  Season one, two.  Were great.  No, what was the one that won all the awards that they just...  Ah, whatever. 
[01:57:30]  They won a bunch of Emmys, I'm sure.  They could be trying to contribute.  And then Edith, like, turned into a cartoon character.  She actually had a normal kind of...  She kind of had a normal voice.  I feel like the answer would be so important to everybody out there.  I was wondering.  Oh, Edith Bunker raped.  She had a normal voice in the first few seasons.  And then it turned into that high-pitched fucking retard voice.  She wasn't as retarded.  She was just kind of a housewife kind of a thing. 
[01:58:00]  Not smart, but not a retard.  I got a question.  Yeah?  Would you fuck that?  Yeah.  Would you fuck that, Jimmy?  No.  Never.  Why was Archie fucking that?  He wasn't.  He was always taking big shits.  Yeah.  Toilet bowl flush made people laugh.  How great was that?  It was timed perfectly.  Yeah.  Where's Archie?  He's taking a shit.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I wasn't going to go down this road today, but what the fuck?  Old dirt road.  I remember this, and I hope you remember this one.  Yes.  I loved this show growing up. 
[01:58:30]  Richard in Pensacola, Florida.  Richard?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Yeah, that was a huge $6 million.  The $6 million man fan.  You know, when they were getting him, you know, when it first started out, he was doing  all this secret service, kind of, you know, doing all this government work.  Yeah, that was like how the show started.  You're right.  They made him into the $6 million man, and then he was sent out on missions, like, to  overthrow governments and spy on people and do shit that, like, they wanted him to do 
[01:59:00]  as the $6 million man.  You're right.  And then as the series started winding down, what happened next?  He was fighting Bigfoot.  Yeah.  Remember that?  They had him fighting Bigfoot.  He caught Bigfoot, I think.  He had him fighting Bigfoot.  Yes.  He could go on YouTube and watch it.  I watched it the other day on YouTube, and just sat there, and I couldn't even laugh.  How awful is the Sasquatch?  Does it look real? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, it's got to look horrible.  No, no, he didn't look real.  Oh, it's got to look terrible.  Daniel, can we look at the Sasquatch?  Can we look at the Bigfoot?  $6 million man Bigfoot episode.  Oh, that would be great.  He shows him tracking it through the Northwest, and then, you know, he of all people finds  Bigfoot.  Why would he make the noise when he...  Oh, my God.  Look at Bigfoot.  Oh, Jesus.  Why is he posing with a picture of Bigfoot?  He looks stupid, Bigfoot.  What the fuck? 
[02:00:00]  I want to see them fight.  Is he on YouTube?  Yeah, we'll find it.  I want to watch the motherfucking Sasquatch.  Thank you, sir.  Hi, man.  Fonzie jumps the shark.  He certainly did.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  That's something.  Fuck.  $6 million man Bigfoot.  Oh, thank you.  Speaking of $6 million man, did you guys watch 60 Minutes last night after football?  No.  Did you see the grape thing?  Crappyfilms.com.  They're calling it Crappyfilms.com? 
[02:00:30]  It's on Crappyfilms.com.  60 Minutes.  Speaking of the $6 million man, they have, like, they call him the greatest inventor.  In the world or in America, whatever.  This guy came up with a prosthetic arm.  And the guy that was trying it out plucks a grape from a group of grapes.  And the reporter goes, no.  He was just like, his reaction was awesome.  Just wearing a glove, maybe.  It looked like a fake arm.  He was trying a magnetic grape. 
[02:01:00]  He had a little magnet in his chink.  It hits his fingers from three inches away.  It's like grapes.  You got to see this.  Dan, if it's on YouTube, that would be great.  But the guy actually, with a fake arm, with these fingers, is able to grab a grape.  I don't know how the fuck they figured that out.  He's funny, that's the only thing he can grab.  Like, he can't drive.  He can't hold anything else.  He can only eat grapes.  He shits like crazy.  Just eat grapes.  Salad shooter out his ass. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  He's fighting.  Oh, he's kicking Bigfoot's ass with that fucking bionic arm.  And it's all in bad 70s slow motion.  Wow, this is going to be a fight to the death.  And the Bigfoot just kicks him off.  It's so bad.  And he makes a missile sound when he flies.  They're saying Bigfoot was a robot in this show.  Who's watching him in this show?  Bigfoot was what?  A robot.  Oh, really?  No, I don't think he was. 
[02:02:00]  Hey, this isn't bad TV for the time.  It's awful TV for any time.  Why is it Bigfoot?  The sound effects are horrendous.  I actually don't mind the Bigfoot's outfit.  He looks kind of evil.  He looks pretty mean, yeah.  Yeah.  This is not like fucking Harry and the other rolling around getting to know each other.  That's my favorite part.  Yes.  Two of them are just rolling.  He's rolling me around.  I wonder who was in the suit.  This is not as bad as I was talking about.  They had to get a really tall actor to play Bigfoot.  I wonder who was in the suit.  I wonder if it's a famous guy. 
[02:02:30]  I'm going to go with Star Wars guy.  No.  Why not?  It's about the same time, right?  Uh-oh.  Bigfoot has a tree.  And he's running after him.  I think he could outrun Bigfoot if he's carrying a big tree.  What's going to happen?  Why would he stand there and let Bigfoot hit him with a tree?  He doesn't even have to do his backup.  He doesn't even duck this fucking asshole.  He just takes the tree. 
[02:03:00]  What the fuck?  Dummy.  Huh.  Tony is right on.  All right.  We'll watch the TV.  So it would seem.  In development, a $6 million man movie.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  Who's going to play Steve Austin?  Probably a black guy.  Seriously?  It's the trend.  $6 million motherfucker.  What other movie are they redoing?  It's, oh, Karate Kid.  Andre the Giant was really in the suit?  It looks like him.  No.  Yeah.  For real?  Yes. 
[02:03:30]  That's what Travis says?  I don't believe Travis.  He's actually right.  That's what the internet says.  Oh, it doesn't?  Hey, that's pretty cool.  Andre the Giant.  Yeah, see, he just teared his robot arm off.  Oh, shit.  So Bigfoot was a robot the whole time.  Oh, he's bionic, too.  Well, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, I didn't understand.  I was wondering why he couldn't just kick his ass.  And he goes, give me that back.  And he took the arm and he runs off.  Ah, government conspiracy.  That's what it is.  Thermite paint. 
[02:04:00]  The good old thermite paint.  Let's go to Jeff in Cleveland.  Jeff.  Hey, how you doing?  Welcome aboard, Jeff.  Yeah, when we went back to All in the Family with all this talk of Lady Gaga and that hermaphrodite track star,  Archie had a real unique description of hermaphrodites.  And he called them morphodites.  And Meathead said to him, what the hell is a morphodite?  And Archie goes, hey, it's too much of both and not enough of neither. 
[02:04:30]  What a great line.  I got to watch it All in the Family this week.  Too much of both and not enough of neither.  Very good.  Can we find the video from last night to 60 Minutes?  Take the way it goes.  Yeah, that fucking arm was really creepy.  Really fucking creepy.  Because they got the leg thing figured out.  You see more and more guys walking around with the fake leg.  Spatula foot?  Not even.  No, the spatula foot is for sports.  You need spatula foot. 
[02:05:00]  The regular fake leg with the sneaker on it where it bends like a...  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  They're walking to a point you can't even tell.  It is amazing.  The only reason you can tell is because they're wearing shorts.  You're like, oh, okay.  Oh, look at that thing, though.  Huh?  Is that it?  I just want to see the part where he grabs the grate.  Team.  Yeah, I know.  Sorry.  Who's the doctor?  It's worth checking out for yourself on YouTube because...  But mad scientist. 
[02:05:30]  They've been trying to figure out this arm thing forever.  And this guy seems to have figured it out.  I don't know how it works.  25 circuit boards and 10 motors.  But it would be no good at all unless the patients were willing to accept it.  We went and started talking to the real patients and potential users.  When you accept it, you wouldn't want it.  And immediately we were shocked to learn even just the hollow plastic shell that they wear  when they're out and about sweats and it hurts and it irritates. 
[02:06:00]  And we came back and realized that if we build the world's best nine-pound arm, but nobody  will wear it because 24 hours a day or 12 hours a day of wearing a nine-pound arm is going  to be irritating and frustrating, we said, we've got a way bigger problem here.  So Cayman's team created a new way to connect the DECA arm to the body using tiny balloons.  And you'll notice now if I hit this button, these things are inflating.  And that's a nice, gentle pressure there. 
[02:06:30]  But if that's displaced all over your whole shoulder, that's an enormous amount of structure.  So now the arm is gripping tight on the shoulder so you can lift something heavy.  And as soon as he's not gripping tight and heavy, one or the other might just deflate.  Ready to put it on?  Okay.  Cayman asked Fred Downs, the VA official in charge of prosthetics, to take off the hook  he'd been wearing for 40 years, to give the new arm a try.  I'm moving this around to see how stable my stomach is inside here. 
[02:07:00]  The arm is controlled by flexing the shoulder and pressing buttons built into his shoes,  almost as if he's typing with his toes.  Ball of the foot, outside of the foot.  Oh, that's how they figure that out.  What if he's walking?  He's like jerking off.  His arms are all over the place.  Why is he waving at everyone?  No, no, he's not.  He's watching punching people.  It's been just kind of long in my years of being in charge of prosthetics.  I just want to see the great thing, because that's ridiculous.  Some great stuff, but in the long run, it doesn't really work, because your body only  has so much tolerance for gadgetry. 
[02:07:30]  After practicing for 10 hours, Downs showed us what he could do.  He's picking up my toes to grasp this.  That's good sugar.  He just picked up a soda and he could drink it.  The feeling is hard to describe.  That seems like...  First time in 40 years, my left hand did this.  Squeezed.  I almost choked up saying it now.  It was just such an amazing...  Well, you don't need a hook.  It's fucking 2009, you dummy. 
[02:08:00]  It felt so good to move my arm again, to do things with it.  Not as fast, not as this, but it worked.  You just said, move my arm again.  Did it feel like your arm?  It did.  It did.  It felt like my arm.  Yeah, then they took it away and gave him his hook back.  Right, here you go.  I'm ready for this arm.  If Downs is eager to have the Deca arm, imagine what it would mean to Chuck Hildreth, who lost  both arms at the age of 18 in an electrical accident. 
[02:08:30]  Wow.  Electrical accident.  He's been volunteering at Deca for nearly two years.  It seems to me that one of the issues here would be that you don't have any feeling in  this hand.  So the question becomes, I mean, how do you pick up an egg?  How do you pick up something that you might crush?  How do you know?  I have a vibrator sensor here that tells me how tightly I'm grabbing things.  The more intense the grass, the more intense the vibration is.  Jeez.  You know, you've set me up here with a plate of grapes, and this I've got to see. 
[02:09:00]  I've just crushed them angrily.  How do you pick up the grapes?  I'm on the floor closely.  Watch this, guys.  No arm.  Cut to the shoulder.  Fake arm.  He's got fingers.  He's going for one grape without crushing it.  No way.  No.  Consider, Chuck hasn't eaten like this in nearly 30 years.  He's missing his mouth, though.  He misses his mouth.  Many of the innovations in robotics that make this possible are already at work in artificial 
[02:09:30]  That's great, though.  There you go.  People who lose their limbs, that's great.  Dude, that guy just picked up a grape with a fake horn.  I know.  But you know what?  It'll probably take, what, another 10 years where we could actually use that.  Yeah, some insurances won't cover it.  This shitty country.  It's ready to go right now, obviously.  If a guy could pick up a grape, give these guys, like, their arms back.  Give them their metal arms.  As much as I am happy for him, it would have been better television if the arm would just  And clumsily knock the grapes all over the floor.  And he's just like, wait a minute. 
[02:10:00]  I got it.  Yeah, then he choked himself accidentally with the fucking devil arm.  Grab the producer's tit.  He's off camera.  This thing has a mind of its own.  I don't know where it's going to go.  People are running out of the building in fear.  His arm is chasing him.  He's fucking not even attached to it anymore.  It's the evil hand like that Michael Caine movie.  It lurks in the toilet and then just pokes its fingers at people's heinies.  It's like a game of gotcha he plays. 
[02:10:30]  That's pretty cool, though, huh?  Yeah, it's amazing.  Yeah.  That came out of nowhere last night as I was watching football.  I'm like, wow, I've got to watch this after the game.  Now it's stored at Cyberdyne.  No shit.  It's easier to lose a leg than an arm, right?  A leg is much easier.  Fucking way easier, dude.  Would you rather lose a leg or both ears and a head?  I could have both ears and a head.  Losing an arm.  Losing a head, you just lose the ears by proxy.  Would you rather lose a toe or both arms? 
[02:11:00]  Big toe?  No, middle one.  Middle one?  So your feet always look like they're doing a Spock impression.  They humiliate you on the beach.  Live long and prosper, everybody.  Oh, sick.  Works in the Terminator.  Sure.  It's the same fucking thing, basically.  They just made it look cooler for the movies.  The arm has become aware.  Aware.  Aware.  I can do that, too.  Aware.  Aware.  Should we take a break, guys?  Please.  A couple sues Walmart over kids' bath time photos. 
[02:11:30]  That could be a bad one.  It was a misconception.  A man proposes to a woman right before a head-on crash.  Is this audio?  Oh.  Oh, that would be huge.  All right.  We got some audio to play.  And what's up with the Mayweather audio?  I don't know.  He beat Marquez.  And then in the post-fight interview, I don't know.  Let's just listen to it.  I don't know.  All right.  We'll find out after the break.  O.P. and Anthony.  I saw Jim Norton in the hallway. 
[02:12:00]  I see him right here.  And he was cranking up some Simple Man by Leonard Skinner.  The live version.  The live version?  Yeah.  The studio version's good, too, though.  Oh, I'm sure it is.  I just have the live version.  You love that song, huh?  Yeah.  It's great.  I don't know why this.  I'm so hungry.  Do we have that on karaoke, Danny?  The Simple Man?  Why?  You know how to sing it? 
[02:12:30]  I'll get it.  Yeah.  Can you get Simple Ton in case E-Rock comes over?  Sorry, I see.  Oh, that was a little lead-in to the weekend, which did include some karaoke.  The karaoke system is in.  Nice.  It is in the house down in the bar area by the stage because the big wedding is this weekend.  Big wedding between Don and Patrick.  Yeah, I hear you can't make that one, can you? 
[02:13:00]  I know.  I know.  I told them.  I'll send a gift, though.  Yeah.  Would you write?  That's it?  A gift.  Oh, shit.  That's your anniversary.  When is that?  It's coming up, right?  My watch stopped.  I think I'm 10 months in already.  10 months.  10 months today.  We're tomorrow.  10 months in?  Wait.  What?  What?  Is that what I think it is, what you're saying?  Yeah, I haven't gotten a gift yet.  It was a wedding?  Yeah.  Jimmy was very generous, too. 
[02:13:30]  Was he?  Yes.  Very.  Orally?  He tends to be.  Sign photo of myself.  Yeah?  God.  Probably displayed right next to the shitter.  Nice gaudy gold frame.  Yeah.  Flowers on it.  Anyway.  Karaoke wedding.  What's up?  Oh, yeah.  The big wedding's coming up, so the karaoke's in.  Although we're going to have a bunch of people from a lot of bands there, too, because they're  going to be attending the wedding, so the band equipment's coming outside, too, so we're 
[02:14:00]  going to really annoy the neighbors.  Yeah, yeah.  They think, like, summer's over.  No more parties.  You think they're in their houses going, thank God?  It's the last big fiesta of the year.  Do you warn your neighbors, at least?  Are you that guy?  No.  I know.  I love that gag, and a lot of us do it, where you're having a party and you knock on the  neighbor's door and go, hey, I'm having a party.  I would love to have you.  That means, please don't call the police.  Yeah.  I invited you.  Yeah, I know.  You don't want these neighbors at your house.  You figure that's a way around the whole police call thing. 
[02:14:30]  I know the chief of police.  I play cards with them.  J.D.  Sheldon.  Law's on my side.  Shut the fuck up.  But, yeah, so we got the karaoke thing.  And now, the thing is, there's one thing, having a karaoke machine.  The other thing is having things to play on the karaoke machine.  And I noticed something.  Karaoke discs, very expensive for a big box set that maybe three songs anyone would give 
[02:15:00]  a shit about.  And the rest of them are shit songs?  Garbage.  For real?  Happy birthday.  Uh, fucking, you know, uh, uh, some, some crappy, uh.  What are the big three, what are the big songs for karaoke?  Uh, any kind of classic rock is huge.  Um, country's pretty big.  And, uh, R&B is, uh, good.  But, but, uh, and then your stand is like any one hit wonder is huge.  One hit wonder's huge. 
[02:15:30]  What are the, do we have a list of the top karaoke songs of all time?  Wow, I wonder.  Ooh.  Top karaoke songs.  It's a category.  50 best karaoke songs of all time.  Let's do the top 10.  Let's do all 50.  Let's add some of our own.  All right.  Um, and, uh, so you bought the box set?  No, I didn't.  Oh, okay.  Dan, in his infinite wisdom, figured out a way to, um, get them off of a computer. 
[02:16:00]  And, uh, burn them.  Oh, nice.  Um, but do you still get the words?  Right, it's a hard drive.  The words, everything.  See, I got a big screen that I got put up on the other side of the room.  Right.  No wires.  It's mounted right on the wall.  And then we've got the system up on the stage.  But the worst part was now, you kind of got to test it out.  You got to give it a test run.  And there weren't any parties going on at the old compound this weekend.  So the gayness, that was me and Danny drinking beer and just singing karaoke songs to each other. 
[02:16:30]  To each other.  Are you kidding me?  It was so gay.  We even acknowledged how gay it was.  Danny at one point just went, you know, this is pretty gay.  What was the worst song that was sung to each other?  Yeah.  Pretty gay.  Was it some dumb love song?  Well, we didn't sing to each other.  No, I know, but...  Like, he would sing, and I would kind of just be at the bar, kind of had TV was on also, so... 
[02:17:00]  And I made a point to not look in the direction.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because a lot of times I was just kind of turned away, looking completely in the opposite direction.  And I wouldn't look at him from where I was sitting, and vice versa.  When I was singing, I wouldn't look over Danny.  I was just concentrated on the screen.  And Danny, of course, was doing something else completely different, not paying attention.  But you've got to, you know, shake down the system, adjust all the levels and everything  like that.  They're all set for the big party.  Yeah.  But it was...  I kind of wish there were other people there, namely females would have been nice, but it 
[02:17:30]  was just me and Danny warbling tunes to each other.  That's really funny.  In the basement.  That's really funny.  How fucking creepy was that?  Well, everything works, right?  Everything works.  There you go.  I waited until you were gone before I did Billy Joel's Honesty.  This is the...  Well, I didn't wait to sing R.E.M.'s The One I Love.  Yes, that's true.  I was privy to hear him sing R.E.M.'s This One Goes Out To The One I Love.  Oh, you're at the bar drinking Guinness? 
[02:18:00]  I was like, yeah, let me do it again and put the game on.  Oh, what the fuck.  He sang it to the bar.  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  A couple surprises on this list.  Wow.  So you got the top karaoke songs of all time.  Yep.  You go with number 10.  Roxanne.  Yeah, looking at the police.  Roxanne.  It's a big one.  Number nine, you see a lot of times.  You don't see it done very well, but a lot of people do it. 
[02:18:30]  It's one of the famous duets.  Paradise by the Dashboard, like by Meat Loaf.  Because now you need two people that can kind of sing.  You need a guy with a lot of range.  You need a chick that can sing.  It's very difficult.  Lee's telling me you've seen the Meat Loaf documentary on MSG.  They show it every other fucking day.  I haven't seen that one yet.  Where he went back on tour, and he still has the young, hot type thing.  Oh, right, right, right.  And he looks just like a creep now, because time has taken hold. 
[02:19:00]  And even though he's a lot older, but he's still casting the young thing as a young, hot thing.  I'm going to fucking say anything about this story.  Huh?  Glass House, my friend.  But then there was all sorts of controversy, because the press got a hold of it.  They saw the show, and they're like, he looks like a creep.  Yeah, he really does.  So then he went with...  I only sing to Danny.  Then he had to get a wig.  He decided, I'm going to get a wig and try to look like my old self.  The Meat Loaf wig? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  He's got the long hair thing going.  So then that's what they decided.  We'll make fun of this a little bit, and I'll get the old wig, so I kind of look a little younger.  It's worth a peek.  And Meat Loaf is...  He's a strange, strange fucking dude, man.  He's sick all the time.  Really?  Complains about being sick all the time.  He's irritating, basically.  Yeah.  He's irritating.  Yeah.  And you can't fucking comment, Anthony, because people in Glass Houses cannot throw rattles. 
[02:20:00]  People in Glass Cribs.  Number eight.  Kenny Rogers, The Gambler, is one of the top karaoke songs of all time.  I would think, you know, you get that little country thing going.  Seven.  Start Me Up, The Rolling Stones.  Really?  Really?  I don't know about that.  I don't know.  Come on.  I mean, this is just one.  This is one.  This is one.  There's probably a bunch of lists.  Can we get the top lists of... 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  We have to put it...  Number six, I thought, would be a lot higher.  That's the first surprise.  Journey.  Don't Stop Believin'.  Very difficult song to sing.  Very high.  No.  Come on.  Go ahead.  Just a small town.  Yeah, you know, it's very hard.  Living in a lonely world.  Ted's about to sing.  Oh, Ted?  Yeah.  I don't know the lyrics.  Ted has a mouthful of bagel.  Bagel.  Very interesting.  The Hoot of Thoughts and Sweet Caroline was number one. 
[02:21:00]  Whoa.  Ted.  Ted Flows is the number one.  I think I had a lot to do with that, by the way.  I'm sure you're making it number one.  Sweet Caroline is one of Vance's favorites.  Well, number one, yes.  Number five, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.  I love rock and roll.  Bobby Darin, four.  Mack the Knife.  Mack the Knife.  Really?  Steppenwolf, Born to Be Wild.  You hear that a lot?  You can see a drunken guy doing Born to Be Wild.  Number three, Garth Brooks, Friends in Low Places.  Yeah, that gets everybody singing.  And, of course, Neil Diamond, Sweet Caroline is number one. 
[02:21:30]  That's a biggie.  Numero uno.  Someone revealed that early.  Audience participation.  Ted Sheckler, I believe.  He's been removed from the studio.  Ted didn't know.  He was so anxious to be on radio.  Ted was eager.  He thought to win, you had to say the number one, and we were just getting them all wrong.  He thought you guys didn't realize that you were reading the wrong direction.  I'll go from top to bottom.  We're vice versa.  Poor Ted. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, so we're looking forward to the big wedding, the big shindig.  A lot of people are saying I should cam up and karaoke.  At least do the karaoke thing.  Well, I don't know.  That would be a little scary to actually cam up and sing karaoke in front of my little talk show audience.  Have everyone else do it.  That would be awesome. 
[02:22:30]  Well, that I plan on doing.  You should set up your broadcast area.  Sal's going to do it.  It's just a karaoke thing, and if people walk up to the mic, then they're on cam.  Well, that's going to happen.  Sal will do it.  We'll get to see Sal.  That's this Saturday.  Sal's still talking about his appearance a year ago?  Oh, of course.  I got line.  I got, what was it called?  A guy of the day, thing of the week.  What did I get?  It's line of the day, Sal.  Row, I got line of the day.  He absolutely killed that day.  Oh, he loved it.  Every time I see him, I'm like, I know, I know. 
[02:23:00]  Come back.  Oh, Jesus.  Come back and hang with us, Sal.  He loved it.  What time should I get there, Saturday?  Anytime you want.  Of course you know.  Were you invited?  Jimmy.  Jimmy's invited.  I invite people.  I'm the wedding mooch.  I was invited after I made it really awkward.  How'd you make it awkward?  No, you were invited.  He brought up the wedding on the show.  I'm like, oh, was I?  The next thing you know, a day later, I got an invite.  And Jimmy, of course, you can come. 
[02:23:30]  Of course you can.  Dude, as long as I'm out of there, before my 8 p.m. show at Montclair at the Wellmont Theater.  Oh, really?  You're doing a show in Montclair at the Wellmont Theater?  Saturday at 8.  I mean, look, if you want to go to the wedding, call 877-935-5668.  You can see me go to the wedding.  Oh, okay.  Pretty smooth, huh, boys?  That's interesting.  I like it.  Go to see that.  But Danny, yeah, I got a lot of discs.  But, you know, a lot of country.  Apparently there's a lot of country. 
[02:24:00]  Country's really big.  And, you know, I didn't necessarily compile the entire library.  No, no, I realize.  Yes, yes.  So I still need to go and do some shopping.  No, I think you did a damn good job.  That's a good selection.  Well, you know, you needed some kind of bass to test things out with.  And there was really no rhyme or reason to my purchasing.  Good.  I was singing some moody blues the other night.  Which one?  All alone.  Like, um...  By yourself?  By yourself?  Like not even Danny around?  No.  Yeah, just all alone.  You're down in your basement singing moody blues to yourself? 
[02:24:30]  How creepy is this?  I'm down in the basement.  I'm singing a little moody blues Tuesday afternoon.  Oh, I love that song.  And I got a Guinness in one hand.  And I have a .45 caliber pistol strapped to my hip.  And I'm singing alone in my house.  I think that's the only way to sing karaoke.  Of course it is.  If you think about it.  Of course it is.  Who wants to really sing in front of everyone?  You really want to sing.  Because then you can belt it out.  See, this is a perfect way to see what you can sing before you go out to karaoke and realize, 
[02:25:00]  Uh-oh, in the middle of a song you go,  Oh, jeez, that's out of my range.  Or I don't really know how the words and the music go together.  Right.  Nah, you just get up there at my place and you can shake it down.  Oh, it's fun.  What are you going to sing?  What are you going to sing when you come there?  We've got plenty of songs.  I'm not going, remember?  I have something else to do.  Yeah, but some other time.  I've got to do that thing.  It's permanently there now.  I've finally got to do that thing.  What? 
[02:25:30]  Slide fishing.  Oh!  I want to fly fishing on that day.  How awful is that?  You've got to get pictures.  It makes me smile.  You've got to get pictures.  You've got to get pictures of dumbbells.  I think we're going to cancel.  I think I'm canceling because I've got to go to the wedding.  Oh, Bobby would just be so sad.  Whatever, man.  Dawn's more important than Bobby.  Just leave him standing up.  Just stand him up.  Fucking leave him.  Huh?  Just don't show.  I haven't seen the mob in a while.  I want to go check out the whole mob.  Bring Bobby and you could just practice casting in my pool. 
[02:26:00]  That's a good idea.  We'll have E-Rock swim around.  We'll try to catch him.  Ow!  He's just got hook marks in him.  Propeller marks in his fucking...  Yeah, I didn't know how far we should take it, but what the hell, yeah.  Right to weld him.  Right to manateeism.  Of course.  Right to weld him.  You know, the biggest mammal on the face of the earth.  Of course.  I would sing karaoke by myself, so I don't think that's too weird.  Yeah.  I get scared, though, when I'm singing that someone's going to come down the stairs and 
[02:26:30]  peek around the corner and look at me.  Then I'll have to shoot them.  The one time you and I sang karaoke, it was the hardest song ever.  I know.  It was ridiculous.  What was it?  Did we have to do Man Eater?  I think it was Hall and Oates, yeah.  We sang Man Eater?  Yeah.  We were buzzing, and it was a goof.  All right.  You know, the Hall and Oates thing.  That's not an easy song to sing.  No, no.  And it's quite funny.  And it's quite funny.  In your mouth, how are you going to get the words out? 
[02:27:00]  That's a great burp.  I love burp.  I love burp.  Footer's calling you the Rupert Pupkin of your basement.  Yeah, I want to get a cardboard audience that I could just...  What did he ask you?  The cardboard Jerry.  Nothing.  What did he say?  No, no.  It was a whispered thing or something.  I mean, what did cardboard Jerry say to him?  He goes...  Where he got that reaction?  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah.  That was the best part. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  Like, cardboard Jerry was just hysterical.  He probably said, Liza Minnelli's, you know, cunt stinks.  Good luck in Vegas.  Good luck in Monday.  Taps a cheek.  Calm down, you.  Why don't we do All in the Family?  Because we brought it to the show before the break.  Talking about that morphodite.  Morphodite.  That guy had a great line, you know, telling us what Archie said.  Yes.  But I want to hear it for real.  So here it is.  Not only that, I had Michael eat him, too.  Mike?  It ain't enough that he's a pinko and an atheist. 
[02:28:00]  You're sure going to turn him from a man into a morphodite?  What's a morphodite?  A freak with a little too much of each and not enough of neither.  So much each and not enough of neither.  That's unbelievable.  Anthony, Sal, I didn't know this.  Sal's going to be singing Every Rose Has Its Thorn.  Every Rose!  Now, Sal will do what he always does.  What's his song?  Christmas Shoes. 
[02:28:30]  It's Christmas Shoes.  Wait, I'm trying to remember.  He does the same.  He does Kenny Rogers.  Which song does he do by Kenny Rogers?  He doesn't do The Gambler's.  No, no, no.  Lady?  No, fucking.  Coward of the County?  I've seen it.  No, no.  I've seen it a few times myself.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is this song again?  He hasn't done it in quite a while, but he's done it eight million fucking times.  It starts with a bar in Toledo, across from the depot. 
[02:29:00]  Oh!  Pick to find time to leave me Lucille.  Right.  Very good.  You pick to find time to leave me Lucille.  And then he goes, everybody for...  Yeah, he's the only guy that gets the audience participation going on during his time.  Turn the bar in Toledo.  And he always starts there. 
[02:29:30]  And you go, no, no.  You gotta start there.  Up across from the depot.  At Baltimore, actually.  Oh, Baldymore.  He's been in New York for 8,000 years.  He still can't shake that Baldymore accent.  Balmore.  Her name.  And by now, though, he's still, like, behind.  Because it's, like, the same...  And then when the key changes here, he's all off. 
[02:30:00]  He's still going, you pick to find time...  Oh, wait a minute.  And then he goes into pick to find time.  Pick to find time to...  No, no, not yet.  Oh!  And he's done it 8,000 times.  I love the...  Oh, good.  I love the cocky assholes when they're doing karaoke.  They wave off the fucking reading machine.  No, I got this.  Oh, wave off the vocal.  You know, even if I know them... 
[02:30:30]  They purposely turn, like, look, look how good I am.  I don't even need to see that.  You know what's fucked up?  Even when I know the words, I look at this...  You still want to look, right?  I don't want to look.  And I don't know why I do look, because you sing better when you don't look.  Because when you're looking at the words, and the little highlight is coming up, it makes  you kind of sing a little more staccato than you want to.  You don't flow into it.  Right.  And then when you're not looking, it sounds a lot more natural when you're singing it  than when you're reading it.  Which is fine, but the guy that makes it obvious to the whole place... 
[02:31:00]  Oh, cocky guy likes...  No, look...  Hey, I won't be needing this.  Nope.  I think I got this covered, all right?  Starts walking around.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  I'm going to do my own interpretation.  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure I have this.  Oh, no.  Meaning on a karaoke disc, so...  Oh, okay.  Oh, you better have this, or Sal's going to be pissed.  Hey, we got more Archie Bunker.  Uh-huh.  Listen to this one.  What are you ashamed of?  You're a hero.  You saved a life. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, lifeguards give mouth to mouth all the time.  Listen, Aiden, lifeguards' victims is always wearing bathing suits.  So lifeguards know who they're mouth to mouth.  This freak took my breath under and assumed sex.  The man is not a freak.  Outside of wearing women's clothes, he could be just like anybody else.  Well, I'd never let my sister marry one.  Oh, my God, do you?  That was when the tranny gave him mouth to mouth.  Did he give a tranny, or the tranny gave him? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, yeah, right, right.  He was in the cab, I think, and he gave the tranny mouth to mouth.  If you had known he was a transvestite, would you have let him die?  My God, she would not let him die.  It says in the Bible, love thy neighbor as you love yourself.  Yeah, well, wait a minute.  It also says in the Bible that a witness shall not bear falsies against thy neighbor.  Falsies.  Which is what that fag balled up against me. 
[02:32:30]  Fag.  You don't even know what you're talking about.  It just so happens that the majority of transvestites are heterosexuals.  That's what I said, faglish.  Not homosexual, heterosexual.  You'd be surprised how many married guys with kids are transvestites.  How is it you know so much about these things?  Let me see your underwear.  Just give me a straight answer.  You want to save the man.  Yes, yes, all right. 
[02:33:00]  I would have saved the man, yes.  Even if I'd have known he was a transvoisant.  In that case, I would have blew into him through my hat.  Through my hat?  Fucking brilliant, man.  Blew into him, drew my hat.  Holy fuck is that correct?  Just fucking calling him a fag.  Fagless.  Was that where that came from?  We used that a bit.  That's an old Yiddish term, I believe. 
[02:33:30]  But just that he could use the word fag like that in context of a gay guy, it's amazing.  I would have blew into him through my hat.  Through my hat.  Oh, fuck.  That's fucking great, man.  Absolutely.  All right.  This guy has more on the Mayweather fight.  Oh.  Hey, Jimmy, what do you got?  What's up, fellas?  Oh, Jim.  After the fight, you had Bernard Hopkins, Shane Mosley, who were in bed with Golden Boy Promotions. 
[02:34:00]  And they all want to get paid, so they're just trying to get to Mayweather.  Because if you fight him, that's really the only way you're going to get paid right now.  That's basically what it came down to.  So they all got in the ring and surrounded the announcer while he was doing his interview just to piss him off, really.  But I still don't think he'll bite.  See, I don't even know what you're talking about.  I know you're explaining it, but I'm so out of the fight game these days.  Well, I mean, it wasn't that great, but the only good thing about it is Mayweather with his 24-7s, his family, they're crazy. 
[02:34:30]  So that's a little bit interesting.  And the fact that Mayweather absolutely dominates people like Marquez, who are supposed to be Hall of Fame boxers, you know,  and still dominate in the sport themselves, you know, he goes in there and destroys them.  I think that's still drawing the crowd.  But as far as getting paid, like I said, Shane Mosley wants to get paid.  I don't think he cares if he wins or he loses, but Golden Boy, Bernard, all those guys, you know, 
[02:35:00]  the only way to get the big paycheck is through Mayweather.  Who won the fight, Mayweather?  Oh, yeah.  And he absolutely destroyed them.  Did he knock him out?  I don't even know.  No, around the ninth, tenth round, I think he could have knocked him out.  But I think it was more of a respect thing since Marquez really isn't a shit talker.  He kind of gave him the benefit of the doubt and just continued to out-jab him, you know,  hit him every round by probably 40 to 5.  Right.  Jimmy, are you a big boxing fan?  I like it, but, I mean, I kind of prefer UFC. 
[02:35:30]  I still respect boxing.  No, I'm not.  In fact, I would probably rather watch a good UFC fight over that.  But something about Mayweather, I think, is interesting.  I thought his family, his dad and his uncle, they look like they're drunk all the time.  And every time they speak, it's, you know, it's something to listen to.  You know what's amazing, though, when you watch a fight?  Like, I was watching some old foreman fights they had on MSG.  They showed a couple of old fights when he was, like, 21.  He could have been the greatest of all time, George Foreman.  I think he could have been, too.  Because he, and he left the sport, obviously, and he still had a lot to give. 
[02:36:00]  And then he came back and did what he did, which was amazing, obviously.  But, man, can you imagine if he fought a lot more in his prime?  Well, he wasn't the best boxer, but he was so strong and so fucking, he had pretty good feet for a giant guy.  But I watched him fight, as devastating as he was.  And even at that time, a guy like Fedor Emelianenko or any other great heavyweight in the UFC would fucking, not toe-to-toe, if Foreman laid a glove on anybody, he'd knock him out.  Yeah, a different style.  But I'm saying is that the boxers, as great as they are, the whole lower half of their body is vulnerable. 
[02:36:30]  And any UFC fighter would just grab their legs.  You would never stand up with Tyson.  Boxers might as well just be in wheelchairs.  I think boxers would be dangerous, too.  They can't use the second half of their, you know, the lower half of their body.  I wonder if in his prime, Tyson, though, could have been taken down on the floor and still just fucked someone up.  No.  He had such a low center of gravity, big, hard-hitting, strong motherfucker like that.  He's got to learn those moves, because they could just snap your arm or your ankle or whatever. 
[02:37:00]  They do exactly that.  They push your ankle the wrong way, and your Achilles is fucking gone.  You're done.  Yeah, but you've got to almost set up for that.  I'm not sure if Tyson would just have you completely unconscious before you're able to do anything.  If he had you.  I'm talking about him.  Back when he used to storm out of the fucking corner and just kill people.  You know what?  You've got to look at Brock Lesnar.  You know?  I mean, he's a powerhouse, and at this point, no one can beat this guy.  But his first fight out, you know, he got fucked by a move he didn't know anything about. 
[02:37:30]  True.  Or he didn't.  It was the early form.  True that.  It's not even about the...  Look, Tyson...  Again, if Tyson hit any UFC fighter square in the middle of his face, the guy would be dead.  I can't imagine.  Anybody in his prime a Tyson hit was in trouble.  Ken Norton was a motherfucker, too.  He was a...  And Foreman destroyed him.  Yeah.  Ken Norton was a...  He went 15 rounds in all.  He broke his jaw.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  He fucked up Allie pretty good.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Big jewel.  Why would anyone fight Foreman?  The glory days of boxing.  Wow. 
[02:38:00]  I'm just watching Foreman fight in black and white.  Yeah, Dan from Ohio.  You should look up...  Black and a white.  Yeah.  You should look up what Dana White from the UFC said about the boxing match.  Well, let's listen to the Mayweather audio and see if there's anything here.  And, you know, I want to get...  I want to get thanks to Reebok and all the sponsors that sponsored the fight.  Let's do it, baby.  Before we do any commercials, let's not do any commercials.  I got to do my commercials.  That's seven figures, baby.  I got to do my commercials.  Floyd, you gave up $600,000 reportedly on the scales yesterday. 
[02:38:30]  Well, well...  Why?  Well, I'm not here to talk about money, you know.  What about we?  I'm happy with the victory.  You know, I want to thank my team.  My team's supporting me.  I want to thank my father, Floyd Mayweather Sr.  I want to thank Roger Mayweather.  I want to thank all the fans that came up.  Floyd, it seems that you perceive questions like that as being negative, when, in fact,  we just really want to know.  It was a spectacular performance, and people are curious about the weight.  You don't want to address it at all?  Well, I'm here to talk about my victory. 
[02:39:00]  You know, that's in the past, and I'm ready to move on to the next thing.  Okay, we'll take that as a no.  Is the audience listening to that audio?  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  I think they got that from UFC, because Rogan does that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, well, they always did the post.  The audience couldn't hear it.  But the audience didn't hear it.  You're right.  It was just for the TV.  This is the one.  Mayweather gets mad at Shane Mosley for interrupting his interview.  There is, before we get to Pacquiao, it's on everyone's mind, there is another truly great 
[02:39:30]  fighter here tonight, who's your size, Sugar Shane Mosley.  What are the possibilities that we see that fight in the near future?  Well, Shane Mosley is one hell of a fighter.  And I don't take that away from Shane.  You know what I'm saying?  I let Al Heyman, I let Al Elyby conduct my bouts, and then we go from here.  I'm not scared of Shane Mosley.  I'm not scared of no fight.  We just want to get on.  That's all.  I mean, the fans want to see a great fight.  Me and Money Midweather.  Let's get this on.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[02:40:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  All right, that's it.  Hold on.  Bernard, everybody calm down.  Floyd, Floyd.  Bernard, please.  Come up there and interrupt you when you're doing your interview.  Don't disrespect me.  Respect me as a man.  Okay, okay, okay.  Shake hands.  Good.  Now, Floyd.  Respect me as a man.  Now, Floyd.  Shane, not now.  Manny Pacquiao.  I thought that would get your attention. 
[02:40:30]  I knew what I could do.  I knew what I could do.  And you showed what you can do tonight.  Let me ask you about the selection of Marquez as the opponent.  It seems that...  The thing is this.  I'm going to do the talk because you can do too much talk.  The thing is this.  All right, Jim.  Let me do the talk again.  Jim.  Okay, dude.  What a baby that announcer is.  You got this great moment.  These fucking fighters are arguing.  And this asshole is trying to conduct this interview.  And he's talking over it.  Just throw the mic in between the two of them and let them fucking go.  And it's not your job to calm it down. 
[02:41:00]  Let it happen.  It's a moment.  Calm down.  Calm down.  That would be a great moment for boxing to let it continue.  Got it.  Mine is beeswax.  Absolutely.  Exactly.  Harsh language, though.  All right.  Whatever.  So that went down over the weekend.  What did Dana say about it?  I'm sure he wasn't impressed.  I don't know if you...  You know, we get suggestions from the instant feedback.  Sometimes it's worth playing and other times it's not.  I don't know.  I don't know if it's worth playing yet, so...  How about what did he say?  Can instant feedback or just tell us what he said?  I don't know.  Yeah, we'll get to that in a minute or two. 
[02:41:30]  In Spanish.  God, John Edwards has a fucking giant head.  Oh, yeah.  On his cock, apparently.  Shits a lot of jism.  Yep.  With a lot of live sperm.  Yeah.  Is he the father of that baby or no?  Well, he is the father of one.  Now they're saying maybe even another one.  Love, child.  Why would you let your sperm loose?  I know.  Put it in her shitter or her mouth.  Not if you're in that...  That's my motto.  I'll let it loose. 
[02:42:00]  I have a bumper sticker I saw.  It says that.  The situation he's in.  What is he doing?  Nothing.  I was watching some great serial killer movie the other night.  Oh, Ted Bundy.  It was a poorly made movie, but it was kind of cool because it just showed him being just  a brutal savage.  He'd walk up to women getting into their cars, take this little lug wrench, and just smash  him over the head out of nowhere.  After talking real nice to him, hi, you think you could help me? 
[02:42:30]  And he would use that, could you help me?  He had a fake cast.  He'd be like, could you help me with my books?  And I got all these law books over to the car.  And she'd be waiting by the passenger side, and he'd make like he was going around to  the driver's side.  And just from the wheel well, he'd pull out this little lug wrench thing and just bash  the girl in the head, throw her in, and then just horrify them.  One girl, he had tied up in a shed, and she was bloody as all fuck.  He had no qualms about beating the piss out of women. 
[02:43:00]  He was a brute man.  Just punching their face, all bloodied.  She's handcuffed to this pole in this shed, and he brings in another girl, and as this  other girl is hanging by her handcuffs, she watches as he rapes this other girl, and then  takes a giant boulder and just smashes her head in.  What the fuck?  And the girl is hanging by the handcuffs, just like, she can't even really scream.  She's just, like, horrified. 
[02:43:30]  And one of them actually runs out of the shed and runs into the woods and finds one of the  bodies that he had killed in the woods, strangled.  And she's on her elbows and knees, just, like, rotted, kind of dead, like he posed her.  She's all naked, and he was, like, fucking her in the ass and just left her there and killed  her.  Did the girl get away?  And then fucked her?  The girl got away who ran out of the shed?  No, no.  He caught her.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:44:00]  He caught her.  Cut her up.  Because there was a really weird misconception about Bundy, and he was, like, this debonair kind  of serial killer.  Like, he is kind of, because he was handsome, he was smart.  He's kind of, um, what's the word?  Not idealized, but maybe idealized is it where people just think he was more of a gentleman.  Yeah, yeah.  He was a fucking piece of shit.  Oh, an animal, huh?  Brutal.  I think his last victim was a 12-year-old girl who he suffocated in the mud and raped.  He was a fucking dirtbag.  And he had a, um, yeah, I think this was the movie, he had, like, a girlfriend who had 
[02:44:30]  a young daughter, and just, what a creep, though.  He's dead, right?  He was executed.  Oh, yes.  Right, right, right.  Because he should have been.  Oh, yes.  Took a little long, but they finally did get to him.  Well, he escaped from jail, I think, in Colorado.  Twice!  Motherfucker escaped twice.  He's one of the biggest serial killers ever, and he fucking escaped twice.  And he would have gotten away with it.  If it wasn't for you darn kids.  Yeah, if it wasn't for that damn van, and the dog was looking peanut butter off the honey. 
[02:45:00]  I think he started killing it in Florida, and he got caught because of a traffic violation,  the same way Berkowitz got caught, the same way fucking Randy Kraft got caught.  So many of these guys get caught.  Yeah, yeah.  Simple things.  Wouldn't you make sure all your parking tickets are paid if you're one of these guys?  Your blinkers work, you know?  They lucked out with fucking Berkowitz.  Ah, it's my tags.  If it wasn't for that.  I forgot to put on my tags.  You would have continued.  I'll take care of this.  You just sit still.  Yep.  Thought we could take care of it right here in Brainerd. 
[02:45:30]  Right here.  In Brainerd.  Yeah, Bundy was a real fucking...  Just want to be in compliance.  And you're influencing people all over the country.  We got Dave in New Mexico.  Dave.  Oh.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Dave.  Dave.  Davey!  Happy birthday, Dave.  Hey, buddy.  I'm a first-time caller.  So, Anthony convinced me to buy a gun.  And I went and got myself a Mossberg two weeks ago.  Somebody broke into my garage.  Ah, there you go.  And thank you. 
[02:46:00]  Appreciate it.  Love you guys.  And I heard Jimmy's favorite Guar song is fucking an animal.  I actually am not familiar with Guar song, but I like the guy, Odorous, as a guest.  I think he's cool.  Odorous is fun.  Play that fucking song.  All right.  All right, we'll play that for you.  We have, um...  Thank you, Dave.  I don't know who you guys want to have.  I mean, I just thought we should have another, uh...  I don't know what that...  The word is.  Oh, instead of, I mean, caller. 
[02:46:30]  We should just get to the next caller.  Oh.  What?  I don't...  My...  What?  What?  This never works.  This means...  This means caller.  Whoever.  All right.  How about, uh...  But, I mean, I want to get that audio up if we can.  We're just trying to figure out some audio stuff, guys.  Yeah.  Steve in South Carolina.  What do you got for the show? 
[02:47:00]  Good evening.  What?  Gentlemen, Washington State, over the weekend, a, uh, convicted murderer was released, was  let go at the county fair.  He was on a...  All right.  We fucking covered this already, dude.  Holy shit.  All right, dude.  Forgive me.  We fucking covered this.  Okay.  Later.  Yeah, right. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, did he get mad at you?  Oh, is that fun?  All right, dude.  I gotta...  I can't be a dick.  I'm kidding.  Of course.  I wrote on a piece of paper, I want to be mean to the next caller.  Like, whoever it was, I was just going to be a dick.  But you wrote, I want to be mew to the next guest.  Well, I figured, yeah.  Well, that means that, like, when they...  Which confused both of us.  Yeah, it meant me.  You can't figure it out.  So I was just kidding, sir.  That was good.  He was...  Well, excuse me.  He started off with good evening and got... 
[02:48:00]  What?  What?  Sorry.  Just kidding.  Let's, uh...  Let's, uh, do a little backstage with ONA as we go to break here.  See what, um, Sam's up to.  Backstage.  In the hallways of SiriusXM.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is primetime.  Primetime, Sam Roberts.  Time, primetime, Sam Roberts.  Although he hasn't been on the air in weeks, Bobo's presence has been felt in the SiriusXM offices. 
[02:48:30]  As he's been showing up here, regardless.  We went to Bobo to talk to him about his lack of air time.  Bobo, what time did you get here this morning?  I got here at 6.30.  Oh, cool.  What time is it now?  It's around 10.30.  Uh, the show's over.  Yeah, that's right.  You weren't on the air?  Yeah, that's right.  Were you here last week?  Yeah.  You weren't on the air last week?  Yeah, that's right.  What's going on, Bobo?  Uh, I don't know.  I guess they...  I guess they wanted to go a few weeks without me.  Also, you were kicked out of the hallway. 
[02:49:00]  You were thrown into Steve C's office.  I don't know why, for some reason, they thought it would be better for me to sit there.  Bobo, do you think they're starting to fade you out?  Nah, I hope not.  It seems like they might be.  Hopefully that isn't the case.  Do you want me to try to get to the bottom of it?  Uh, you...  If you want.  Okay, thanks.  With such fervor and passion as Bobo had, we decided to go straight to the source on this one.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:49:30]  Hey, Anthony and Opie, do you guys have a second?  I'll walk with you.  Uh, you better walk quick.  Okay, I'm walking quick.  Elevator bound, my friend.  You guys know Bobo was here today?  Oh, no.  Kenny, excuse me.  I'm trying to get a comment from Opie and Anthony about...  Tell him, Kenny.  Tell him.  About Bobo?  Tell him, Kenny.  Not now.  I mean, he was here, and he wasn't used on the air.  He didn't under...  Next week.  All right.  Well, okay.  That's the important part.  It's leaving.  Thank you.  Friday.  Thanks, guys.  As Kenny's massive frame blocked the backstage crew, we learned that O&A's reputation for 
[02:50:00]  being unapproachable is indeed deserved.  We went to executive producer Steve Seed next.  Ask him.  No, is it okay if I come by next week?  No, is it okay if you come by next week?  No.  No.  No, I said, is it okay if I come by next week?  But before you said that, you said...  Well, what's your answer?  My answer is no.  Oh.  Bobo.  So I guess that leaves your next appearance up in the air. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  You know what?  I mean, what do you think?  Mm-hmm.  Happens.  This is not good news.  That's not, but it happens.  Are you 15 minutes up?  Uh, hopefully it isn't up.  But what's your gut feeling?  Mm, could...  Could...  Could...  Could be...  Could be indeed.  Have we seen the death of Bobo on the Opie and Anthony show?  Only time will tell, but in the meantime, let's all feel good about the depressive state 
[02:51:00]  this little dummy's been put in.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with O&A.  Opie and Anthony, starring little Jimmy Norton.  Who said that's a bunch of jive?  Who's the audio of?  I know.  That's a bunch of jive.  Sounds like from Airplane or something.  No, no, it's ours.  It was ours?  Oh.  Joe Jackson.  Maybe I wasn't close enough.  Joe Jackson.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It was from the Michael Jackson day.  Okay. 
[02:51:30]  Okay.  Uh, birthdays.  Ugh.  Bill Murray.  59.  Really?  59 for Bill Murray.  I'd have put him in 60-something.  Uh, Stephen King, 62.  And the only reason we're doing the birthday is because it segs into something.  It's mine.  Leonard Cohen.  The great Leonard Cohen.  Any Leonard Cohen fans here?  Uh, no.  Really?  No.  What is...  That voice. 
[02:52:00]  What is he saying?  Murder doors.  That guy from, like, fucking that movie with, uh...  The National Born Killers.  That's the Born Killers.  He's saying the opening and closing song for him.  Oh.  It is murder.  Murder.  Murder with that voice it is.  He's 75, but we only...  We almost lost him the other day, and there's a YouTube video of Leonard Cohen, uh, coming  out on stage for his first song, and halfway through it, he falls down on the stage,  passes out, and then this fucking guy that filmed this video on YouTube shuts his  camera off just when it was getting good. 
[02:52:30]  People always do that.  What is that about?  Oh, they get scared.  It's the first video there, yeah.  It's right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  This frustrates me if, you know...  Then don't put it up on YouTube.  Oh, he's all sentimental, if you know what I mean.  I love the country, but I can't stand the scene.  And I'm neither left or right, I'm just staying home tonight, getting lost in that hopeless 
[02:53:00]  little scream.  But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags that time cannot decay.  I'm junk, but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet.  I don't remember seeing that.  This might be a different version of the video.  I don't remember seeing that part. 
[02:53:30]  It's coming through a hole in the air, from those nights in Tiananmen Square.  What a great voice.  It's coming from the field, and this ain't exactly real, or it's real, but it ain't exactly  there.  From the war against this order, from the silence night and day, from the fires of the 
[02:54:00]  world, from the ashes of the game, democracy is coming to the U.S.A.  Liberal cock.  You don't like him?  I love it if I had to say that.  It's coming to a crack in the wall, on a visionary flood of alcohol, from the staggering 
[02:54:30]  account of the Sermon on the Mount, which I don't pretend to understand at all.  Stop singing, Hobson.  It's coming from the silence, on the dark and day, from the grave of all the night.  Good songwriter, though.  It's a sick voice.  Democracy is coming.  Literally.  Jonathan told me a story about him, but I heard he lost millions.  Oh, really? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Did it say this is the pass out video?  Just fast forward to the end of it.  If there's a hat on the floor, we know we hit it.  No, it's...  I think some hat removal was due.  Yeah, go back.  It's...  Yeah, it's that one.  Yeah, the three-minute version.  The first one.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, you can... 
[02:55:30]  You can fast forward when it buffers.  Buffer.  Buffering.  What the hell is he?  Oh, the guy with the hat.  People scream.  Do they go, oh?  You'll see.  It's a setup to nothing, because the guy turned his fucking camera off.  What a dunce. 
[02:56:00]  Like a...  And he's trying to sing on the floor.  I know I know.  Like a...  In a midnight choir.  I've tried.  In my way.  To be free.  Looks good in a hat.  Like a...  All I know.  Is he on the floor? 
[02:56:30]  He's kneeling, I think.  Oh.  Maybe because he knew he was a little sick or faint or something.  Or maybe that's what he does.  I don't know.  All right.  He gets up.  Start on his knees.  He staggered off to his feet.  There he goes back down.  Back down to his knee.  Wow. 
[02:57:00]  I hope that you could find...  You're just feeling it, huh?  To let it all go around.  This is his first song, too.  It's coming up now.  If I had been on the floor.  If I had been on the floor.  I hope that you know by now.  It was never to be... 
[02:57:30]  He takes his hat off.  It's probably hot.  He's standing.  Again.  We'll be leaning against the drum riser.  He's having a tough time.  He's lazy.  That hat's fucking making his head hot.  What is it, lead?  Yes.  I told him, never will you get a platinum hat again.  I texted that to him. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, he's supposed to be singing, I think.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's an awful long interlude.  He's just standing there.  Sounds like the guitarist is covering.  And then...  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:58:30]  He's just not singing.  Oh, and he just falls over.  Oh, there he goes.  Everyone stops playing.  And then...  And commotion.  Oh, my God.  What's happening?  And...  All right, and he ends it.  Why would you end there?  Why?  The drummer jumped off like,  Oh, brother, there goes me bread and butter.  Why would you end the video right there?  I can only hope, for the sake of him,  is that his fucking...  Someone else taped it,  or that his...  Maybe his thing ran out.  His thing ran out? 
[02:59:00]  His thing?  I mean...  What thing, Jimmy?  Maybe he only had a certain amount of space  to give it a fucking camera or whatever.  Sure would have been a coincidence.  Sure would have been.  His thing.  Sure would have been.  His thing.  The thing!  So, happy birthday to Leonard Cohen, 75.  What happened to him?  Did he say why he fainted?  They said it was stomach problems.  That's what they said.  What did he stomach lose?  He had a sour stomach, eh?  That's what they...  I heard...  That was what I heard on the news,  whether that's a, you know...  Yeah, he was suffering from a stomach complaint, 
[02:59:30]  tour promoter said.  We need Leonard Cohen in this world, eh?  We need a guy like Leonard Cohen.  Well, if God needs him, you know,  it's pretty much a done deal.  God needs a man in a hat.  Yes.  I heard he was...  I don't know the story, so I can't tell it,  but he was going to quit music,  or he quit music and went away for a while  to be a monk or some shit,  or to do some weird stuff.  Hippie.  And he left his girlfriend,  or whoever she was,  in charge of the money,  and then the money wasn't around.  It's such a... 
[03:00:00]  I don't know if that's the story.  Wow.  But it was some awful one  that you go like,  fuck, you dope.  What were you thinking?  Exactly.  Don't trust a skirt with the cash.  You tell him, Jimmy.  You tell him.  All right.  Remember that Sex and the City rant  we did last week?  Who could forget it?  It was about Samantha fucking everything.  Well, we got an update in the paper this weekend.  Thank God, Ant.  Thank God they captured a picture...  What's going on?  ...of Samantha in a wedding dress  as they filmed the sequel 
[03:00:30]  to the Sex and the City movie.  I hope there's a donkey in a tuxedo.  A big boner.  Yes, so do I.  Making everyone wonder  if she's going to, like, you know,  stop being a whore and settle down.  Oh, is that it?  Like, maybe they're trying to get a rumor out,  like, oh, has she finally found the right man?  Who's the man that can satisfy Samantha?  Oh, gee.  We got cots out of him like an octopus. 
[03:01:00]  Fucking cum.  She's probably doing a fucking...  Who could suck off the most cots video  in a wedding dress.  Yeah, bring it on, boys.  It's just all horse shit.  But we did some good rants  on the Sex and the City movie  being filmed in the city.  Of course.  It's not like people are trying  to get things done in this city.  Oh, yeah, they are, man.  Yeah, yeah.  You have a UN fucking assembly.  That's great. 
[03:01:30]  It's that time of year again?  It certainly is.  Do they do it every year  or is it like the Olympics?  Every fucking year.  They drag these savages from every nation  into Manhattan,  which is already fucked,  and then close down a bunch of streets  to fuck it some more.  Security everywhere.  You can't drive.  You can't walk places.  And just to have  these fucking people here  is a threat.  Threat!  Can't do nothing.  Get it out.  Get it the fuck 
[03:02:00]  out of New York City,  especially.  Yeah, we did say that  and put it in Des Moines  and just somewhere weird.  Get it out of the whole United States.  Well, that's never going to happen.  Who fucking needs the UN here?  Why did it decide to put it here?  I don't know.  Fucking put it in Moscow.  Whenever my dad would get mad at the country,  he'd go,  yeah, Uncle Sap.  Uncle Sam.  Uncle Sap.  I'm taking another one.  Yeah, my father was called  Uncle Sap.  Uncle Sap.  That's funny.  That's such an old guy thing to say. 
[03:02:30]  Uncle Sap.  Let me tell you,  Uncle Sam  is now Uncle Sap.  Not like the old days.  Well,  the Sex and the City thing.  Derek and Steve are at it again.  And I think they took  some of our words  and made something out of it.  Uh-oh.  On an all-new Sex and the City,  radio's Anthony Cumia  guest stars as  Samantha's chatty cousin,  Ophelia.  The guy I was with last night  put a horse to shame  with the size of his dog.  While Samantha  undergoes a hysterectomy, 
[03:03:00]  Ophelia joins Carrie  and the girls for cocktails.  Yes,  another round of Cosmos  and one for my pussy, too.  I'm going to do a handstand  and just pour it right down  the old fuck flu.  If you thought Samantha  was the wild one,  wait till you hear  what Ophelia offers  up.  I left the oven mitt  duct taped to my dog's paws.  How embarrassing.  But what a fucking  my Labrador gave me.  Oh.  When these ladies  get together  for a night on the town,  there's no telling  what can happen.  You gonna buy some shoes? 
[03:03:30]  Yes,  the last ones  I had are full of cum.  It dripped right down  out of my pussy  into my shoes.  It's douching  and douche chills  on an all-new  Sex and the City.  Let me see,  what day is it?  It's an ass day.  Friday's all about  my bunghole.  I love the fact  that she goes,  I need new shoes.  Cum leaked out of me  and ruined my shoes.  I did say shoes.  Shoes.  I wanted to say shoes  more than once.  It was just funny  the way she fucking, 
[03:04:00]  she bookended  the cum thing  with shoes.  With shoes.  She needed new shoes.  Nothing about her stockings  or underpants.  It just leaked out  and ruined her shoes.  And right down  to her shoes.  Her shoes,  her shoes.  One of my favorite  auto lines  is George  was chastising  auto gently  and he said,  I'll bang you  in the ass  until there's blood  in your shoes.  Do you know  how hard you have 
[03:04:30]  to fuck someone's ass  until there's blood  in their shoes?  Because blood dries  on the way down.  That's got to be  a brutal auto.  It's funny, man.  You must have to  somehow sever  a femoral artery  with your dick.  Just the fact that  they're partners.  They work together  and yet the puppet  threatens him with that.  Yeah, yeah.  They're partners.  They work together.  They travel together.  They're on every plane together.  Yes.  Fuck you in the ass  until there's blood  in your shoes.  What a vile threat. 
[03:05:00]  That's how a girl  should walk.  Where the thighs  don't touch.  That's all we ask.  You like a big gap  between?  Well, I'm not big  but you don't want  but I don't like  some of those girls  that looks like  they're fucking  they got a lot of room  in there.  Oh, well then it starts  looking like they're  bow-legged.  I'm not talking about that.  Here's the swimming  with bow-legged women.  Made it myself  pretty good stuff.  Now this.  Police say  what a Walmart employee  found in a roll of pictures 
[03:05:30]  is disturbing.  Uh-oh.  Oh, now Jimmy  did you take the  Uh-oh.  We get it.  Jimmy's weird.  Can I guess?  Yeah.  A nuclear weapon.  Uh-oh.  From your new action movie?  Yes.  Where agent Bill Chesterfield  comes in  and removes the weapon  from the roll of film.  I hate Bill Chesterfield.  Chesterfield.  I hate him.  Why?  He sucks.  Is he agent Bill Chesterfield? 
[03:06:00]  Agent Bill Chesterfield  and he wears a hat  that's tilted sideways  and he winks a lot  at the girls.  Jimmy.  That's me.  Someone on his feedback  goes what is Jimmy's  fascination  and it was reading.  Okay.  Has Jimmy ever explained  his fascination with hats?  Who doesn't love a good hat?  You add hats  to a lot of your bits.  Of course I do.  I add hats to sentences.  Hats are hysterical.  Who doesn't love a hat?  I challenge you.  Find me one among you  who doesn't care for hats.  You show me someone  that doesn't love a hat 
[03:06:30]  and I'll show you a communist.  This might take some work  but can we get a montage  of Jimmy talking about hats?  Possibly.  That would be good.  Might be.  If it's too hard that's fine.  Just every fucking hat reference.  I don't want to give anyone  busy work  but if it's easy to do  that would be really funny.  Everyone,  half this room has hats.  Me and you don't.  That's right.  And Danny, do you?  I always wears a hat.  Steve wears a hat.  But you don't wear a hat.  Is that why  you have a fascination  for hats  because you don't look good  in a hat?  I don't look good in them  but I have a healthy respect  for them as an entity  and as a product.  What did Archie say? 
[03:07:00]  He would give mouth-to-mouth  through his hat?  He'd blow air into him  through his hat.  Through his hat.  What a great line.  Alright, let's find out  what's happening  at the photo thing there.  CBS 5's Steve Filmer  just finished talking  to a couple  accused of taking  nude pictures  of their children.  Steve,  we understand the parents  are now suing  Walmart, right?  Yeah, and Kent,  this is a story  that everybody  who's got a young kid  and a camera  really needs to pay  attention to  especially if you think 
[03:07:30]  some of the...  Would you stop that?  This makes perfect sense.  I'm trying to hear that.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I've told people  this in the past  when people take  pictures like,  oh, yeah,  they're showing pictures  and it's like  a bathtub  or some...  their naked kid  like sitting around  or something  and the parents  think it's cute.  It's like,  oh, he's just naked  or he's in the backyard.  Oh, you take a bit...  First of all, 
[03:08:00]  what year is it  that you're developing  them in a store?  But secondly,  it's like this now  is illegal.  It is considered  in some circles  child pornography.  Even though it's obvious  that it's an innocent photo  of the kid in the bath  or whatever.  It doesn't matter.  What about the parents  that let their kids  run around naked  in public places?  Yeah.  That is fucking weird, man.  We talked about that  at the beach.  You don't know  who's out there.  What the fuck  are you doing?  Putting chum  in the water like that.  A bunch of ghouls.  Remember that  down in California  just laying down 
[03:08:30]  at the beach  when we were out?  I don't know  what the fuck  we were doing  out there.  Was it the wrestling?  WrestleMania?  Yeah, maybe that was it.  We went to the beach  for the day.  Went to the beach  hanging out  and this fucking  naked kid  comes over  and is just  standing next  to my fucking blanket.  Completely naked.  And I look  I hear something  so I look  and there's this fucking  kid  I don't know  what  year and a half  just sitting there  standing there  naked  with a  stupid  that's where  puffy vag  came from. 
[03:09:00]  You see the little  kid and then  they got like  I think  vagors are like  eyeballs.  You know  that  your eyeballs  never grow?  Like your eyeballs  People don't know that.  You are born  with your eyeballs  and they don't get bigger.  They're the same size.  I didn't know that as a kid.  That's a fact.  Yeah.  They're the same size  when you're  like fucking born  as they are  when you're an adult.  They kind of  take a different shape  and stuff  after a while  and the color changes  but the size is the same.  I think that's the same  with vagors.  Like this kid 
[03:09:30]  is standing there  and there's this  giant big  puffy vag  on this little  midget baby body.  Too big for the body?  The vag?  Yeah, yeah.  That's funny.  And it's just  standing there  with that stupid  big pot belly  kid stand  and this big  puffy vag  and I'm like  get out of here.  Very convincing.  Get out of here.  No, I was looking around  for like the parents.  Yeah, they don't care.  And then I shooed the kid away.  That's just fucked up.  With my giant mule. 
[03:10:00]  Really needs to pay attention to  especially if you think  some of the cutest  and funniest moments  with those kids  occur around bath time  when the kids  might be completely nude  or partially clothed  and you think  what you're capturing  is just very natural  and innocent.  They were pulling them  away from us.  Lisa DeMarie is the mother.  Oh boy.  You know what though man  when the parents  the fucking parents  have a right  that's not  if it's innocent  and you two kids  are taking a bath  and they're both  really young 
[03:10:30]  Do we know  what the pictures were?  That's not fucking  pornographic.  These aren't the actual  pictures but  these are  of the same ilk.  Nah, probably of a  different ilk.  They're covered up.  They're covered with a towel.  There's a slight description  in the audio  and from the description  I mean it can sound  questionable but  I mean  it's parents  and their kids  and the bad.  I mean what else  is it going to be  seriously  especially the kids  I mean  the ages of the kids  were 18 months  four and five  I mean  let's just 
[03:11:00]  We were pulling them  away from us.  Lisa DeMarie  is the mother  of three young girls.  She and her husband  Anthony  had their children  taken from them  by Child Protective Services  a year ago.  It was five weeks  before the girls  were allowed to come home.  It was awful.  I couldn't tell them  where they were going  or when I would  see them again.  It all started  inside the  This smells fishy.  No, they were  too young for that.  They would take  the kids away  for five weeks.  That's fucking  What is she not 
[03:11:30]  telling us?  I don't know.  I don't know.  They had to have  a pretty good suspicion  to take the kids away  from where I was.  The pictures I was  supposed to see.  Or when I would  see them again.  It all started  inside this Peoria  Walmart  where the family  dropped off  a memory stick  of digital photos  to be developed.  Some of those pictures  prompted Walmart workers  to call police.  Papa Boner.  The Peoria police report  says there were  a total of 13 photographs  that could commonly  be classified  as child erotica. 
[03:12:00]  Eight of the photos  or as child pornography.  Five of the photos.  The young girls  appeared to be posed  in quote  a provocative manner.  Some pictures  include dad  her buttocks shown  and his hand  on her buttocks.  The family  will not show  or share  the actual photos.  Ha ha ha.  All right.  That sounds a little  inappropriate.  That is a little bit.  Yeah.  That sounds inappropriate.  I don't blame the employees  for calling the cops.  Something's up.  Yeah.  You'd have to  one with the father's pinky  firmly  Yeah.  Why are you touching 
[03:12:30]  your daughter's ass  in a picture for?  That's creepy.  You wouldn't do that.  Unless he's holding her  unless he picked her up  but that's  Picked her  Oh he's like  picking her up  and  Yeah.  Naked.  Get your naked  kid's ass  off your hands.  That's true.  Creep.  A very good question  coming in from Matthew.  Let's go to Matthew.  Matthew.  Yeah.  You get a Vietnamese kid  running down the street  from some napalm  and it wins  a Pulitzer Prize.  What about pictures  like that?  I don't think  that was considered  erotica  when a burnt  napalm child 
[03:13:00]  is running down  the street  and the only reason  she's naked  is her clothes  were barbecued  off of her  by a bomb.  If she was running  away from  if she was running  away from the cock  then you would have  a  Right.  If there was a soldier  chasing her  with his fucking  big dick hanging out  I think that would  be a problem.  Let's go.  There it is.  I don't think  that's considered  erotica.  She's burnt  and fucking  running down the street  crying with other  little children.  That's uh  Mrs. Fuck  her name is now.  She's Mrs. Fuck. 
[03:13:30]  Can you tell  she's burning that though?  Yeah a little bit.  Her skin looks  a little wrinkly  for a kid.  See?  Look at her ribs  and her arm.  Yeah I just read  something about her.  But again  puffy veg.  And she has no  hair on her body.  That looks like  O.P.  What?  What happened?  She's a child.  Of course there  wouldn't be any hair.  That looks  she looks like  she's in pain though.  Give me a bath.  I need cold water.  What about the crybaby  in front?  Yeah he's got his  clothes on.  He's just like  Look behind you.  It could be a lot worse.  Yeah it certainly can. 
[03:14:00]  And look at the soldiers  just listening to some  Jimi Hendrix.  Yeah they don't care.  They're just walking.  Yeah they're listening  all along the watchtower.  Or something.  Fucking purple haze.  Some nice 70's  Rolling Stones song.  Smoking some pot.  Just fucking  machine gunning  rice patties.  They're just walking  along.  They don't care.  That's another picture  of fuck?  Wow.  This is a new picture  of fuck?  Why didn't they  submit that one?  Not as good?  She's not crying.  Oh see now she's  just running. 
[03:14:30]  Oh now she's just  fine.  Oh she's dandy there.  Yeah.  And the boys behind  her listening to some  CCR or something.  They're fucking yeah.  Just fucking rock it out.  Yeah.  The photographers  They got playing cards  in their helmets.  They're just you know.  They're listening to  Fortunate Son and just  fucking like smoking weed.  Right.  Oh my god.  Charlie's gonna pop out  of the bush any second  now.  They got a ville to burn.  They got some hooches  to burn right now.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I bet the naked little  girl runs the whole 
[03:15:00]  fucking operation.  That's how the naked  kook cries.  I'll turn this off.  If you're gonna play  you gotta play it  loud Travis.  She's some fucking  Hewies.  Yeah.  That kid looks burnt.  Who gives a shit?  Right.  We got a mission  to stick to.  Right.  And we're gonna  fucking stick to it.  But sir she's naked  and she's burnt.  Forget about it 
[03:15:30]  private.  She's fucking dead.  Just another casualty.  Yeah motherfuckers.  Die fucker.  Die.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic  things I've ever seen.  Fucking beautiful man.  It's fucking beautiful. 
[03:16:00]  Jesus Christ.  Nothing better than  a Vietnam soundtrack.  Those fucking  those songs they pick  for those Vietnam movies.  It's not a bad one ever.  I know.  Forrest Gump  had some good ones.  Oh yeah.  Are there any good  nom movies coming out?  Are there any good  nom movies coming out?  They're remaking  Apocalypse Now.  No way.  Will Smith.  He plays Colonel Kurtz. 
[03:16:30]  I got a joke.  Goes along with the title.  But it's fast.  Goes with the first word.  Last syllable.  Oh stop it.  Redding wants us  to go old school  and play the classic  Nixon bit with Kim Fuck.  Oh my god.  That is a classic.  Oh that's a classic.  Maybe we can find out.  I don't know.  That was done on  regular radio. 
[03:17:00]  Right?  I know man.  I know.  And we pretty much  said fuck.  The times.  They are.  They did a change.  A changing.  Nathan what do you got?  Hey guys.  Hi Nathan.  Anyone who runs  is a VC.  Anyone who stands  still is a well  disciplined VC.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Hey uh.  Last weekend  not this past one  but the one before  I went down with  my girlfriend  down to Alabama  to visit her  sister and brother-in-law  and their little  18 month old niece.  Took my digital  camera and she  took a bunch of  pictures and of  course there's the 
[03:17:30]  bathtub picture and  the little girl  running naked in the  living room in  grandpa's house and  all this shit.  And she's like yeah  can you email those  to me?  No.  No.  I'll put those on a  disc and I hand them  to you directly and  leave them immediately.  Now that's a smart man.  But you know I got to  looking at the pictures  and I was like damn  she does have a fat  vag.  Stupid babies.  It's got to stop  with a vag.  Keep your vages  covered.  Yeah I think you're  exactly going to  something there.  It's like an eyeball. 
[03:18:00]  It never grows.  Yeah.  Apparently eyeballs  do grow.  There's a misconception  about them.  I heard all that they  don't.  Maybe they just  they get heavier.  Well I'm getting  information that if  your skull grows and  your eye sockets grow  and your eyeballs  didn't they would  fall right out of  your eye socket.  Nope.  No because the  muscle around them  might grow.  Well they might  not grow with the  muscle around the  whole.  All right we're  going to a wiki  answer.  All right.  Let's see.  Answer.  No.  Your eyeballs stay  the same size  throughout your life. 
[03:18:30]  At birth the head  and structures within  it such as the eyes  and brain are more  developed in proportion  to the rest of the  body.  The head and eyes  increase in width  by only 1.5 times  up to age 5 years  and after that only  very small  proportion more  until early  adulthood.  So the eyes do  grow slightly  probably only a  matter of a  millimeter and  only up to age  5 or so.  What's a  millimeter?  Like this? 
[03:19:00]  A silly  millimeter longer.  10 millimeters  make a centimeter.  I was doing a  measurement joke.  Oh oh.  I was doing an  old cigarette  commercial joke.  A silly  millimeter longer.  Anthony we got a  very good phone  call about new  children.  It's Corinne.  It looks like.  Corinne.  Yeah guys remember  the old  copper tone ads  where the puppy  would pull down  the little girl's  panties and her  little hoolie would  show?  Yeah.  I sure do. 
[03:19:30]  Now they've  changed it.  Yeah now they're  politically correct  with that shit.  Yeah.  They changed that  whole fucking thing  and they don't show  her little hiney crack  anymore.  Is the dog still  pulling on the  bathing suit bottom?  Yeah I think so but  no hiney crack.  No hiney crack.  But it has cut down  on the amount of  jism that was on  the billboard.  Hey is that the  that's the old one  right?  Yeah.  And where's the  new one?  See what's wrong  with that?  It's a little 
[03:20:00]  fucking kid.  She's all tan.  We were able to  handle that for  many years.  She's got her  white butt crack  shown because the  dog is ripping  down at her pants  because he smells  peanut butter.  Why?  Why?  Why are you  saying that?  I don't know.  How come that  why is the dog  in the copper  tone head  going up in  minutes?  Jesus.  Up in minutes.  I love it.  That poor peanut  butter loving  up in minutes  wearing dog 
[03:20:30]  that always gets  brought up on  this show.  It's one naughty  dog.  It's a naughty  dog.  One busy  beagle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's not a  new copper  tone.  They kind  of dropped  the hole.  Oh,  I don't  fuck.  Oh,  fucking  hey,  man.  Hey,  we got to  go to  Drew in  D.C.  He's a  soldier.  Drew.  Hey,  what's  going on,  boy?  Hey,  man. 
[03:21:00]  What's  up,  Drew?  So,  when I  was deployed  back in  0304,  my parents  decided to  send me  a slew  of photographs  all put on  one page  to keep me  company  and to  include a  picture of  my two nephews  in the bathtub.  You know,  it's a little  uncomfortable  when you're  with a bunch of  men and they  just want to  make comments  about it.  Yeah,  huh?  What were  they saying?  You know what? 
[03:21:30]  I kind of  blocked that out.  I think the  only thing I  can really  remember about  that whole  time was  one guy  making a  comment and  then me  kicking him  right in  the face.  What did  he say?  Come on.  Uh,  let's see.  I need a  mile of  shit to  see where  it came  from.  Oh,  God.  Boy,  yeah.  You know,  beyond that,  long ago,  I don't  remember a  lot of  the comments.  It was  just a  little  uncomfortable.  Were  they  inappropriate  comments?  Jimmy, 
[03:22:00]  what do  you think?  I don't  know.  Well,  we think  that,  yeah,  they were  all  inappropriate.  I want  this head  so clean,  the Virgin  Mary herself  will be  proud to  take a  dump in  it.  That's  great.  You want  the bathroom  so clean,  God's  mother will  shit in  it.  This is  clean.  The Marines  really know  how to drive  home a  point.  There's a  real art  to being  a Marine,  D.I.  Everything  about the  Corps is  very  important.  They put 
[03:22:30]  it above  God.  Yes.  Yes.  Second  half of  the story.  Can you  describe even  in very  simple terms  the content  of the  photos,  the poses  of the  girls,  what was  going on  when the  photos were  taken?  They're  bath time  photos,  girls getting  out of the  bathtub,  drying,  wrestling,  playing around.  Oh,  boy.  Just  everyday  photos that  everyone in  this room  who has  children has  taken these  photos.  The Demarees  are now  suing Walmart,  the state  and the  city of 
[03:23:00]  Peoria.  We now  realize how  much control  the state  has and  that they  can pull  any one  of your  children out  of your  home right  now.  And we,  of course,  asked to hear  Walmart's side  of this.  A spokesman  responded to  us saying  that they  take all  of the  allegations  in a  lawsuit  like this  very  seriously.  They are  not responding  to specific  allegations one  by one in  the suit,  at least not  yet.  And that  Peoria police  report is  some 60  pages long.  Kent? 
[03:23:30]  Steve,  do we know  the ages of  the girls at  the time  those pictures  were taken?  I need  info.  Actually,  the girls were  about one and  a half and  five years old  a year ago  when all of  this,  the pictures  were actually  taken.  Screw the  Walmart angle.  I want to  know why  the authorities  felt they  had enough  info to  take the  kids for  five weeks.  Well,  if you get  naked pictures  that are  inappropriate  like that,  they take  them right  out of the  fucking house.  That's it.  They must have  been questionable  photos. 
[03:24:00]  There's a  photo of me  when I was  five years old  in a bathtub.  Jimmy,  when can we  I'll show it  to you because  I'm nosing  I'm leaning  out of the tub  and I think  my cat  is leaning  in.  Yeah,  there's a  picture of  me and  my brother  in the  bathtub all  soaped up  and smiling.  It's just  innocent enough,  you know.  It cocks in  my mouth.  This is  innocent.  We're just  having a  couple of  drinks.  A couple  of drinks.  I'm naked  in a tub  with my  two brothers  and my  sister.  Oh, 
[03:24:30]  Jesus.  All right,  when you bring  the sister in  there,  that's a  little rough.  The crockpot.  If you bring  your picture  and I'll  bring my  picture in.  I'll bring  you my  pictures.  Was yours  taken on a  digital  camera?  It scared  me.  I thought  you found  it.  Does it  look like  it?  Oh,  my God,  bathtub kids  are all  over the  internet.  But you  can't see  them naked.  All right,  so they're  so.  Wow,  I don't  know,  man.  The couple  isn't saying  something.  I would  love to  know what  the  authorities  are.  Look at  the first 
[03:25:00]  one.  That looks  questionable.  Absolutely.  All right.  That's not  questionable.  I see.  No,  they're all  little kids.  No,  they're covered  up.  I can  almost see  puffy vag  though.  You can  see.  That vag  is like  a fucking  flotation  device.  It's like  an airbag.  But what  did the  father have  his hand  on the  kid's  ass for?  That's  creepy.  That's  fucking  creepy.  I need  to know  more.  Travis  is a  new  dad.  Have  you  been  touching  your  daughter's  ass  at  all?  I  can't  say I  would  do  yet.  Thanks,  Danny.  Oh,  Dan.  Does  she have  a puffy  vag?  Does  little 
[03:25:30]  Riley  have  a  puffy  vag?  What's  the matter?  It  tastes  like  creams.  Oh,  God  damn,  Danny.  Oh,  shit.  Oh,  Travis.  Danny likes  to poke  my baby  and say,  see,  I'm  fingering  your  baby.  Danny  is horrible.  He is  horrible.  You don't  like that  Travis is  the father.  It's  my  kid.  I  can  do  whatever  I  want  to.  Danny  also likes  to take 
[03:26:00]  pictures of  her eyes  while she's  sleeping  and then  blow it  up really  large and  say baby  vagina.  Oh,  he turns  it sideways  and says  baby  vagina.  Yeah,  he's got  one.  It's  a very  close  shot of  the  baby's  eye.  Danny  is a  despicable  human being  when it  comes to  little  baby  Riley.  very good.  Let me  say hi  to  Richie  boy.  Richie  boy.  Hey,  buddy.  Hey.  I 
[03:26:30]  gotta  say  that  I  cannot  fucking  believe  that the  state  can go  in and  fucking  take  these  kids  out of  these  people's  home  without  fucking  knowing  that  there's  something  wrong.  But Richie  it seemed  like the  photos were  a little  I said  that too  but then  they described  the father  had his  hand on  the ass  there was  a couple  of them  that would  probably  the state  doesn't just  walk in  and take  your kids  a couple  of them  must have  looked  really bad.  Yeah,  I just  want them  to explain  further  why they  felt like  they had  to take  the kids  out of  the house.  They said  yeah,  there was  a picture  where the  father's  hand is  on the 
[03:27:00]  kid's  naked  ass  but  that was  it.  And then  having  two naked  girls  wrestling  around  on the  floor  like  put your  fucking  pajamas  on.  Yeah,  it's really  not necessarily  exactly.  And put  on those  goddamn  pajamas.  That's not  the same  thing as  fucking  like  they  were  being  molested.  I mean  there's  photographs  of their  kids  and the  state's  going to  come in  and take  them  away  in five  weeks.  The bottom  line is  that no  one has  seen  the photos.  I mean  look,  it's a  weird line.  Parents  certainly  have a  right to 
[03:27:30]  be  parent  and you  can  take  a  picture  of  a  kid  in  the  tub.  But  what if  those  were  inappropriate?  What if  the guy  is a  creep?  These  are the  children.  These  kids.  The state  has no  right to  go in  and take  children  away from  the parents.  It's one  thing,  like I  said,  if they  were going  to do  an  investigation,  do that.  If they  need to  protect  the  children.  If they  feel there's  an immediate  threat to  the safety  of a  child, 
[03:28:00]  they  through  laws,  whether  you  agree  with  them  or  not,  Child  Protective  Services  has a  right to  take the  kids out  of the  house and  then do  an  investigation  and see  if it's  safe for  the kids  to return  to the  house.  If they  don't do  that,  you end  up with  situations  where maybe  the kid  ends up  dying and  then the  state's  responsible.  They say,  why didn't  they intervene  sooner?  The parents  knew that  they were  taking those  photos to  Walmart.  They're  stupid  people,  too.  There are 
[03:28:30]  stupid  people that  would do  that.  There's  been plenty  of people.  I agree  with that.  Gary Glitter  got busted  fucking taking  his computer  in to get  repaired and  the guy  opened up  the fucking  DVD-ROM  and actual  children fell  out.  New children  were in his  computer.  Running like  that girl  from Vietnam.  She looked  like little  Kim Fuck.  Just running  away.  Is that how  he took his  computer and  he got fixed?  Yeah.  Could you fix  this?  Look at the  porn.  Yep.  That's  the typical  obviously  guy who's 
[03:29:00]  going to  be  That's  how they  get caught  obviously.  Classic  mistake.  But this  is different.  I mean if  the guy  was molesting  one of those  kids in a  photo, I  would understand  the state  coming in  children.  But I  think they  should be  doing an  investigation.  That's totally  reasonable if  they felt  there was a  question.  Dude, they  would do  that.  But maybe  there was  some of  the photos  they said  a couple  of them  they were  posed.  You're  going like  they're all  just kids  waving. 
[03:29:30]  They might  have been  a couple  that really  would classify  as completely  inappropriate  at first glance.  Yeah, both  of us can  sit here  until we're  blue in the  face unless  we've seen  the pictures.  You know  what I mean?  I'm just  telling you  what the  law is.  Something just  doesn't make  sense.  They can do  that.  I'm kind of  with Richie.  Something just  doesn't make  sense.  I mean the  authorities got to  explain it a  little further  they have.  But he's  saying when  he called  up he said  they have  no right  to go in  there.  It's like  no they  have a  right.  Oh they  do.  Yeah, absolutely.  But they 
[03:30:00]  didn't really  explain their  side of this  in the news  story whatsoever.  They felt  like there  was something  going on.  Something that  didn't seem  right.  I got a  little girl  dude and  if somebody  tried to  take my  photo  of her  I would  do it.  But I  think we  all know  that's not  what happened.  Yeah, I  think a  distinction  can be made  between an  innocent bath  time photo  and something  that people  find provocative.  And then  they said  some of 
[03:30:30]  them were  sexual erotica  and others  they considered  child pornography.  Now whatever  that distinction  is they were  able to make  that distinction  in a number  of these  pictures.  so again  I bet you  one of the  Walmart  employees  got a little  filled up  when he  looked at  the photos.  Maybe it's  porn.  But you're  immediately  making the  right of the  parents  over the  fucking  duty of the 
[03:31:00]  state to  protect kids  from possible  being raped.  because he's  a father  he's taking  this very  personally  Jim.  Very  personally.  Yes he  hears.  I absolutely  am.  I absolutely  am because  like I said  if they want  to investigate  and they want  to send  somebody into  the home  start doing  profiles on  kids and  doing all that  sort of thing  that's fine.  But you'll  yank them  out of the  fucking house.  Dude how often  does that happen?  It's very rare.  I don't know.  The state doesn't just 
[03:31:30]  walk in and  take kids.  There was  obviously  something in  those photos  that really  set off an  alarm bell.  I'll tell you  why they did  it in my  opinion.  My guess is  the state  did it because  they didn't  want it.  If something  did happen to  those kids  they didn't  want the  liability.  It's the  fucking  liability.  The potential  lawsuit.  If something  did happen to  Well now there  is a lawsuit  because they  didn't think  the other way  around.  Like if they're  wrong that the  family's going  to sue them.  I mean you  know they  were  what's the 
[03:32:00]  expression?  You know  Tuna Rock  in a Hard Place.  Thank you.  There was  also something  in that audio  the police  report was  60 pages  long.  What was  in those  60 pages?  There's  something  going on.  Not that  they were  molesting  them but  the pictures  must have  been questionable.  They don't  just fucking  take three  kids for  five weeks  if it's  just a kid  in the  bathtub with  a duck  waving.  They must  have been  questionable  pictures as  far as the  law goes  too.  Their 
[03:32:30]  intent  could have  been as  innocent as  anything.  But as  far as the  law goes  perhaps the  pictures went  over that  line between  something innocent  and something  dirty.  There you go.  We'll take  more of your  phone calls  after the  break or  we'll play  the Nixon  tapes.  I want to  figure this  out.  Opie and  Anthony stay  there. </pre>
