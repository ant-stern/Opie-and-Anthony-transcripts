[00:00:00]  Dan, what's up?  Good afternoon, Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Hello.  Opie, how are you doing this afternoon?  I'm doing good.  You know, after last night's complete mental breakdown that you had on the phone,  where I thought you were going to just completely lose it and drive into an abutment.  Well, yeah.  An abutment?  I'm being stalked by a fag, basically.  And I don't like it.  I don't like it.  But Al Dukes, it seems, has something for Opie, and I don't know what it is. 
[00:00:30]  I'm a kook magnet, I swear to God.  I have more kooks that follow me around than I care to think about.  And one of them works for Ron and Fez, the show that's on after us here in New York.  He's their producer.  Well, that's what they call him.  I don't know what he produces.  It's a cute little title.  So it's a known fact for everyone in the New York area that I just despise this guy.  I don't like him.  It's no radio bit.  But Anthony will vouch for me.  I haven't said hi to him in...  I don't think I've ever said hi to him officially. 
[00:01:00]  No, I don't think so.  He's very upset about this.  He's trying to win your love and buy your love now with things like $3,000 pinball machines.  And what put it over the edge was when Ron and Fez had him kiss a guy, and then he made believe it wasn't a guy, I guess, or something.  He got all drunk, and somehow he ended up kissing a man on Ron and Fez's show.  He got so upset about this that he went outside and tipped over my foosball table I brought in and broke it. 
[00:01:30]  He was acting like an 11-year-old girl.  And that put it over the top for me.  I'm like, you know, I don't have time for anyone like that.  You know what he was?  He was acting...  Destroyed the personal property of yours.  Yeah.  He was acting like a straight guy that can't accept the fact that he's gay and has his gay experience and freaks out.  He kissed that guy and lost his mind.  Started flipping over my foosball table. 
[00:02:00]  Broke it.  So I was like, you're going to replace that goddamn thing.  That's one of the many soap offers that is the Opie and Anthony show.  So he finally replaced it after I had a threaten.  I had a threaten giving out his phone number on the air.  That's pretty much what it was.  You'd have been able to call Al Dukes at his home at 2, 3, 4 in the morning.  Right.  Whatever time you're damn well pleased.  You know that phone would have rang 24 hours a day.  And he finally came to and got the foosball table.  Well, he got the wrong one at first, then he got the right one. 
[00:02:30]  And then he got the right one.  So then everything went back to normal and Anthony decided he would at least acknowledge him.  And that's fine.  If he walks by in the hall, I go, how you doing?  Yeah.  That's about all you.  How you doing?  You'll give him, right?  Yeah.  I just don't want to talk to the guy.  Not going to be taking warm showers together.  And I know I look like a complete A because I've read the email today.  I know.  But I don't like the guy.  Right.  You come across people in your life that you just don't like.  And I said it on the air with Ron and Fez last night.  I honestly couldn't tell you why I don't like him.  I just know I don't. 
[00:03:00]  Right.  And I have no time for him and I don't want to be bothered by him.  Okay?  And I also told him that I wouldn't punch him in the face and, you know, just leave me alone and I'll leave you alone.  He doesn't like the fact that, you know, we'll be walking down the hall and it'll be just me and him, you know, walking toward each other.  Ah, I heard this.  And then it's very uncomfortable.  Not for me.  I love that.  Yeah.  But I guess it's really uncomfortable for him because he knows I'm not even going to make eye contact.  You're the only people in the hall.  Nothing.  I do make eye contact out of the side of my eye, though.  And I see him awkwardly trying to nod and stuff. 
[00:03:30]  And then the look on his face when he realizes that I haven't even acknowledged him.  Oh, I know.  He hates that.  And I know I'm an a-hole for doing this stuff and you can write as much as you want, but I just love stuff like this.  But I said, look, you know, it's a little uncomfortable, but just stay out of my way.  That's it.  I'm not going to even cause a scene in the halls or anything.  Just leave me alone.  So I guess everything kind of went back to normal. 
[00:04:00]  Uh-huh.  And we get back from Christmas break.  And yesterday, Ben's telling me that he bought me a present.  A present.  Anthony, how long have you and I known each other?  Oh, my God.  About eight years now, I believe.  Eight years.  Eight years, yeah.  I think one Christmas.  I've got to remember.  The first one, I think.  One Christmas, I think we bought each other something.  It was something stupid like a computer game you wanted.  And I think you bought me like a Nirvana CD or something.  Yeah, it was ridiculous, some kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right, right?  Is that about it? 
[00:04:30]  That's pretty much it.  And with all the success we've had in recent years, you would think maybe...  We'd cut each other off.  Yeah, you'd think maybe we would have done something for each other.  But no, we're just pals and friends.  But we don't need to buy each other things, right?  I know if you want something, you'll buy it.  If I want something, I buy it for myself.  What the hell am I going to get you?  So I go to Ben yesterday.  So what the hell did this idiot buy me?  He goes, a $3,000 pinball machine.  Now, you're thinking he wants to make the piece or something.  He's going to buy you maybe a bottle of wine.  If he hears the show, he knows Opia likes the wine a little bit. 
[00:05:00]  Maybe a bottle of wine or something.  Maybe, yeah, a video game or something.  I don't do well when people buy me presents.  I think you know that by now if you've been listening to this show.  But I mean, that would even be well over, above and beyond the situation at hand.  Right.  A $3,000 classic Rolling Stones pinball machine.  Which, by the way, is already broken.  Of which they only made how many?  A thousand, I think.  A thousand, yeah.  Well, the thing's already broken according to Ben. 
[00:05:30]  So I said I wasn't going to...  What?  What?  What?  Rick just said a $3,000 pinball machine is a gay engagement ring.  That's the equivalent of a gay engagement ring.  That's good you didn't accept it.  Holy ass.  Al Dukes.  Am I married now?  Jesus Christ.  In some countries.  No, it's good you didn't accept it, dude.  Oh, all right.  So I said I'm not playing the thing.  And then I guess Ron and Fez started...  Can we get Ron or Fez on the phone?  Maybe.  And if they're around.  They listen to the show. 
[00:06:00]  They'll call in.  So I told...  You know, they went on their show to talk about the whole thing.  Yeah.  And what Al was thinking.  Because now Ron and Fez are embarrassed.  Because, you know, we really get along with Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  But there's this thing between us.  His name is Al Dukes.  Al Dukes.  All I heard was Ronnie last night going,  Ah, this is embarrassing, Fezzy.  Ah, this is so embarrassing.  I hope he's on the phone again.  Ah, this is embarrassing.  This is what I did.  So we got off the air yesterday. 
[00:06:30]  And I'm driving to the Coliseum for the Islanders game last night.  And I hear Ron and Fez talking to Al about it.  And he's crying like a little girl because I haven't accepted his gift.  Yeah, you didn't go up.  I guess he probably had it all planned out in his head.  He's going to present this $3,000 pinball machine.  You're going to go, Ah, Al, you know, put your hand out.  Nice, firm handshake.  Al, thanks, man.  Hey, anything that happened in the past, you know, I really appreciate this pinball machine.  And thank you so much. 
[00:07:00]  And, you know, I just want to be able to call you a friend now.  It's probably what he played out in his head.  But now it's even more embarrassing.  It's even more uncomfortable.  Yeah.  I'm thinking, why does this guy care this much about, you know, me?  Mm-hmm.  You know?  He could have a career without me.  He could work here without me.  No, he needs your acceptance, your approval, and, dare I say, your love.  So I was on the air on the way to the game with Ron and Fez the whole ride to the Coliseum. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And Al's trying to talk to me, and I'm like, no.  You can talk to Ron, and Ron will tell me what you're saying.  Ron's the go-between.  I was acting like I was in third grade.  The listener dated that man the e-mail.  What a toolhole if you're an ass.  Don't talk to me.  And so then I have to turn off the show because I'm going into the game.  And game's over.  Islanders win.  I come out to my car.  I listen to Ron and Fez when I'm tooling around town. 
[00:08:00]  And all of a sudden, I swear, as I turn on the radio, I hear Al Duke singing a song to me.  Wait, stop it.  Do we have a copy of the...  Stop it.  Do we have a copy of the Painted Black song he was singing last night?  No.  Dude, stop it.  Where is that?  I swear to you, I have not heard this.  You didn't hear it?  I got to hear it, though, now.  So now he's singing, like, a stupid parody song about the whole incident, right?  So then Sandy, my girlfriend, calls in.  Like, look, man, he's got enough stalkers in his life. 
[00:08:30]  I have to deal with Stalker Patty, which is the guy's eyes to you.  I got to deal with some wacko from Chicago that decides to call us in the middle of the night.  Enough.  Enough.  I don't need another Stalker around, right?  So then he goes, and this is what really freaked me out.  He goes, so what is Opie like off the air?  Oh.  Wants to get to know you a little more.  And I'm listening to this while I'm driving.  So he's asking Sandy what I'm like off the air. 
[00:09:00]  He needs to know more personal information.  He wants to know.  No joke, dude, that really freaked me out.  And now I will have nothing to do with him, and he's got to leave me alone.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to have Steve from FoundryMusic.com walk me up and down the hall now.  Oh, is that it?  That's how bad it's gotten.  So I completely lost it, started screaming.  I told him, leave me the F alone.  Right.  Know what I'm thinking, Ant? 
[00:09:30]  What?  Mail room.  No, the old Carol Miller setup.  Mail room.  Mail room.  Well, every night when we get off the air here, right outside the door is Al Dukes and the rest of Ron and Fez people coming in to set up for their show.  So you want Al Dukes to sit in the mail room.  I want to go back to the mail room.  Until you pass by the mail room on your way to our office.  How well did that work last time we had a problem? 
[00:10:00]  We never had to see or speak to Carol Miller.  That's true.  It did work well.  Well, if he thinks in some way, shape, or form it makes you happy, I'm sure he'd do it.  Well, that's why I want to get Ron and Fez on the line because I don't want to make them more uncomfortable than they already are.  I want to set up the mail room thing without a doubt.  Everyone knows when we walk back down to our office and he can just wait.  Wait in the mail room.  Or wait in Ron and Fez's office. 
[00:10:30]  As soon as he sees us pass by and then he can come out.  Anthony, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, Opie, you've got to do me a favor.  You've got to take the wiffle ball bat challenge bat and smash the crap out of the pinball machine.  You know what?  I think I might take the Jeremy puzzle.  How about the dildo?  What the hell's the name of the guy that was fixed?  Get rid of two things at once.  Look at Ben's freaking out.  Ben really likes that pinball game.  It's broken already, you said.  What's wrong with it?  You've got to smash it to pieces.  Wait, wait.  What happened, Anthony? 
[00:11:00]  It's not like completely screwed, but if the ball goes on like the left side of the two bumpers,  it will go into the hole.  But if you play on the right side, you understand what I'm saying?  What do you mean it'll go into the hole?  There's like one thing bent somehow.  I don't know.  I guess it happened last night.  Everyone's blaming Earl for it.  Fez is on the line here, I believe.  Fez, hey.  I am so embarrassed.  I'm just humiliated.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was quite the conversation.  But, you know, if you keep talking about the pinball machine and things being bent and going into the hole, 
[00:11:30]  you're just going to turn him on more.  Yeah, I don't get what's going on with him.  I was listening last night.  I could barely listen.  It was very embarrassing.  I could barely listen and I was on the show.  Why does he care so much about my stupid life?  He's obsessed.  Why?  What have I done?  Is it a thing maybe where it's one of those guys where everyone has to like him?  It's either that or it doesn't matter that everyone else either likes or tolerates him. 
[00:12:00]  It's the one that he can't get.  Right.  That's the one you want always.  That's most important to him.  See, everyone else doesn't care about him.  Just kind of, you know, like I even go, he said last night, I even, if I see him in the hall, I now go, hey, what's up?  And I walk by.  So that's fine.  But the one person here that does not acknowledge him is the one he needs approval from the most.  Opie has become the great white whale to him.  Yes.  Yes.  Right.  And he wants the Moby Dick. 
[00:12:30]  Moby Dick.  That got so weird at the end of the show yesterday, Fezzy.  It was just bizarre.  And I thought, you know, it's another stalker Patty situation.  Opie's going to lose his voice.  It's going to be our fault because he's just screaming, stop it at all.  I was screaming, stop it.  My cell phone was crapping out.  I was getting so pissed off last night.  Hey, Fez, would this be acceptable now?  Opie's idea of leaving Al Dukes maybe in your office till we pass by.  I say mailroom him. 
[00:13:00]  Mailroom him now.  All right.  You know what?  He'll actually be thrilled because he's going to think it's mail, M-A-L-E.  Oh, well, that's true.  You know, because now, you know, he's going to probably show up in the next hour or two.  And it's going to be uncomfortable.  Now it's going to be uncomfortable.  Now I'm going to be uncomfortable.  I'm surprised you didn't come to work today to an office full of flowers.  Because now I'm going to think the guy's in love with me.  Think.  The guy, you know, and don't get mad or anything because this is no reflection on you or your 
[00:13:30]  sexuality or anything.  We all know you've had a girlfriend for many years.  Everything's fine.  So believe me, it's no reflection on you.  I have a fiance in Niagara Falls.  I'll tell you again.  Of course you do, Fezzy, yes.  And I tear it up, man.  Yeah, yeah.  We have hot sex.  Yeah, sure you do.  Yeah, yeah.  But Al Dukes is in love with you.  He is in love with you in some way, shape, or form.  I don't know if that's fantasies of some kind of sex or if it's just like a cuddling, 
[00:14:00]  nuzzling thing.  There is a love that this man has for you.  It's a male crush, Ope.  You know, that means only one thing.  Get the sledgehammer.  Oh, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Do you really think that, Ant?  If you think that...  Dude, I seriously think that.  And I'm not even kidding.  Get me the sledgehammer.  I'm not even kidding.  Ope, seriously, if we analyze it, look at the gift he gave you.  A Rolling Stones pinball machine. 
[00:14:30]  You have to play the thing.  You have to stare at Mick Jagger's junk to play it.  Yeah.  And they made it extra large on this machine for whatever reason.  It's just...  And don't...  You know, you just look up and there it is.  You don't have to search it out.  Trust me.  I thought it was the third flipper.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, where's that Rolling Stones song he sang?  I got it.  You know what?  If...  Oh, you got it.  I know you don't want to talk to Al Dukes to get it.  I got it.  Oh, Rick has it.  Rory Hamptons would have it.  I think Rick's got it.  Hold on.  Rick's got it. 
[00:15:00]  Okay.  Great.  If A works today, then we got it, because it's not B.  Definitely it.  This is it?  Is it ready to play, or you got to kind of...  Ready to play.  All right.  Hold on, Fezzy.  Oh, I can't wait.  I got to make sure you get to hear this, too.  So this is...  I get out of the Islander game.  Fezzy, I swear to God, I was convinced you guys talked about this for four straight  hours last night.  I swear to you, we didn't.  I turned off the show, and you guys are still talking.  The Islanders win, then I get back in my car, and now I have him singing to me while  I'm trying to get home.  Here it is. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, my God.  Ope hates the new machine.  I have to take it back.  Oh, my God.  Called me a closet bag.  I have to take it back.  I screwed with the biggest show.  It's called Career Suicide.  Oh.  Ope doesn't want a thing from me.  He wants a piece of my hide.  What?  No, I don't. 
[00:16:00]  Ope still won't say hello.  I have to take it back.  Ope just wants me to go and take the machine back.  I tried to buy new friends.  I tried to show some class.  I further burned the bridge.  I'm such a stupid ass.  Oh.  I look inside my...  And that's it.  Oh, my God.  And that's it.  You want a piece of his hide. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, that's...  I'm so embarrassed I'm listening under a blanket.  Yeah.  Isn't that awful?  Look at his pants off.  Yeesh.  We definitely have a problem around here.  Just when the station started to feel cool, we have a problem.  Yep.  Let's try the mailroom solution first.  Then the sledgehammer.  No, I need sledgehammer today.  Oh, no, no.  I need sledgehammer today, and I need the Ron approval, and I need the Fez approval. 
[00:17:00]  Do I have at least the Fez approval, and then I'll wait for the Ron approval?  You know what?  After what you went through last night, I'll sign anything you want.  Fez approval.  Just waiting for Ron to give his approval.  Oh, no.  Get the sledgehammer.  Oh, no, no, no.  If Ann thinks he is in love with me, this will solve it.  Oh, my God.  Just waiting for Ronnie.  And then just leave the pieces on Al's desk.  Oh, my.  Oh, no, no.  No, look.  How much did he spend on this? 
[00:17:30]  $3,000, he claims.  I cannot be partied.  I have never gotten a gift over $200 in my life.  That's what I was wondering.  If today you got there and there was a mink or something.  Hold on.  That's a present that...  Ann, talk to Fez for a sec.  I just want to size up.  The sledgehammer will be better.  Or the baseball bat.  Yeah, I just got to say, a $3,000 gift is something that if you are in a great relationship with somebody, you would get them that if you're doing very well. 
[00:18:00]  I mean, the Kennedys don't exchange gifts like that.  What is he doing?  He's sizing up.  Oh, my God.  He's sizing up.  Hold on.  I got to get on another mic.  Just two seconds.  Let me get over here.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Let me get on this mic over here.  Is this one on?  I'm sizing it up.  Oh, you're sizing up.  Damn, you scared the crap out of me.  You scared the crap out of me.  Dude, I've been in this business a long time.  If I'm smashing this, it's going to be after commercials.  Hey, all right. 
[00:18:30]  So, I got your approval.  If Ron gives the approval, it's done.  Done deal.  All right.  You're halfway there.  Look at Opie going to the people.  It's like a hit has to go down.  You got to go through the proper channels or else you'll get whacked yourself.  I'm showing respect to the Ron and Fez family.  That is.  Showing a little respect.  Appreciate it.  Where the hell is Ronnie today?  I have no idea where Ron is.  Contrary to popular belief, we do not share an apartment.  Well, can you try to get him on the line?  I will look for Ronnie. 
[00:19:00]  This needs to be done today.  Thank you, Fez.  All right, bro.  All right.  There he goes, Fezzy.  We got to take a break.  Do we have those science goggles still?  I'm freaking out.  Okay, good.  Because I know, you know something?  I know you too well.  You better set up the mice because as soon as the call comes in from Ron, it's not even  a question.  It is just out there, get rid of it.  Oh, my God.  I'm looking through all types of...  You know Ronnie is fighting his conscience right now. 
[00:19:30]  He's just like...  He's the guy with his finger on the button right now.  He's the godfather now.  I'm waiting for his approval.  I'm looking at pinball websites because I want confirmation on the price.  Oh, that's a collector's item?  And on the...  And just ask our listeners.  Someone will come up with a price in a second.  Yeah, but I can't trust them.  I've got to see it myself.  I don't know.  We'll get one of the collectors on the line.  I guarantee you.  We'll get the company that he got it from.  Oh, I know it's a collector's item. 
[00:20:00]  Believe me.  I'm just saying...  I don't know how...  I don't know how many they made, what the price is.  He says three grand and they made a thousand of them.  Right now on eBay, we have $585.  For the same one?  For the same exact one.  And judging by this picture, it is in better condition than the one we have.  1980 Bally's Rolling Stone pinball game.  Outstanding clean original condition. 
[00:20:30]  Ready to plug and play without any necessary repair jobs.  Cabinet very clean.  Shows some wear around flipper buttons.  Colors are bright and not faded out.  You know, dude, it's $585.  That's it?  Yeah.  Matt Devote says he knows the price.  Oh, Matt hung up.  Let me go to Kevin.  Kevin, where do you work?  Classic pinball.  I own it.  You own this pinball?  Yes.  Is this Hope?  Yeah, what's up, bro?  How you doing, man?  All right. 
[00:21:00]  Smashing it's a bad idea.  You better get all your plugs in so you're not pissed at me.  I'm not pissed at you.  Classicpinball.com?  That's me.  And where are you located in Clifton, New Jersey?  We're on Valley Road.  Humna, humna, humna.  I was just there yesterday setting it up.  Why is it a bad idea to smash it?  Because it's a nice game.  There's not that many left floating around.  Although, they didn't make only a thousand of them.  They didn't only make a thousand.  No, they made about 5,700 of them.  Yeah, the guy exaggerates everything.  He's also a liar.  He lies. 
[00:21:30]  He exaggerates.  He's a liar.  And just so you guys know, I'd have brought you a Pac-Man if that's what they told me to bring.  Well, the guy doesn't even know me.  For a stalker, he doesn't do a good job.  And he didn't tell me any of the story either.  There was a friend of mine, Donnie, who told me the story when we got in the van to leave there.  He told me the whole thing about what happened with the foosball table.  Yeah.  Now, how much does this thing go for?  Now, the $3,000 number, it's a high number, but they do command that through certain dealers.  They change hands among collectors for $8,000 to $1,500 needing work. 
[00:22:00]  Well, I just saw a mint one for $585.  Well, that's the first bid.  Yeah, that's probably the first bid on eBay, but that'll go much higher.  The first bid was like $400.  I think he was looking for $5.  Can I let you in on some other little dirt that's going to make you hate Al even more?  Yeah.  He didn't buy that from me.  He didn't buy it from you.  He didn't buy that from me.  That's on loan.  I can take that out and bring you anything you want.  He didn't tell me any of the scoop.  He just said, you know, we just want to put a game in here, you know, and we'll plug you on the air. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, is that it?  He traded, borrowing the game for plugs.  Yeah.  I was just getting ready to head out to go look at some stuff at a guy's house, and we heard you talking about it.  So I said, uh-oh, they're going to be calling.  So it's ClassicPinball.com.  Right.  All right.  We mentioned you twice times 2,000.  That's $4,000 worth of advertising right there.  Okay.  Well, go smash it then.  Well, you know what you should do?  Instead of smashing it, you know, think up a good way to give it away or something. 
[00:23:00]  Ah, that's hokey radio.  I've got to break this kid's heart.  How about if I bring you something else to smash?  No, you're going to bring us something else nice.  Well, I'll tell you what.  Tell me what you want, and we'll get it.  All right.  Hold on a while and talk to Rick, okay?  Okay.  I want to play a little, uh, before you smash it.  Well, we'll take a break.  All right.  I'll play a little.  Someone's got to find Ron.  I can't do this without Ron's blessing.  I got Fezzy's blessing.  I am certain Ron will call in before we leave. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, but that's like a goofy radio tease.  No, no, I don't want to tease like that either.  I want it to be a medium.  I want it to happen, like, after break.  I want it to happen soon.  All right, we've got to take a break, Ant.  All right.  So that's where we stand.  Mm-hmm.  Ronnie calls.  Rolling Stone.  Pinball machine is history.  Ronnie, if you're out there, please give us a call.  If anyone knows where Ronnie is, he's got to call the Opie and Anthony show today, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Just waiting for Ron's blessing, Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Wow! 
[00:24:00]  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  All right, Anthony, are you ready for Middle School Confession?  Yeah, I'm trying to find it on their website. 
[00:24:30]  By the way, Adam Farrar in the studio.  How are you?  All right, we have 12 clips, Anthony, from Middle School Confessions.  This was a show that was on HBO, what, last night?  Last night, HBO.  It debuted on HBO.  They'll run it another 10 times, don't worry.  I can't find it on their website.  Well, it's a little saucy.  It's quite racy.  And saucy.  If I must say.  Saucy and racy.  Saucy, you think?  Bit risque.  It's very risque.  And I'm amazed that these moms would allow HBO to film their slutty daughters in middle school. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  If someone had to sign a release for that.  I didn't understand that myself, watching the tape.  The host, Samuel L. Jackson, which is a little funny.  Really?  Yeah, he's talking about middle school kids having sex.  Which one's yours?  It's the one that says, bad mother f***er.  His wallet.  Get my wallet out of there, Ringo. 
[00:25:30]  It's the one that says, bad mother f***er.  Yeah, so this is a show, kind of an expose, on middle school kids, what is that, anywhere  from 12 to 14 years old, talking about sex.  Talking about giving Hummers.  And drinking and what they do.  Talking about digits.  Digitally manipulated.  And we don't mean math.  Boyfriends.  Right.  And one girl with the braces, the slutty girl. 
[00:26:00]  And the other girl talking about how she's a pure, let's just say, in every sense except  the mouth.  Same girl.  Same girl.  Braces girl?  Big face full of braces.  And she's just going to town.  Going to town.  And then the parents are talking.  And talking about how their kids, they don't know what their kids are doing.  And then there it is.  And you put this on HBO, you know these kids are going to go back to school and, hey,  oh, hey, you're the BJ girl from the HBO show. 
[00:26:30]  They don't tell you what schools they attend, do they?  No, Norton.  And thank God they don't.  Well, they did tell us one school.  Yeah, that was the gay kid.  The gay middle school in Belleville.  Uh-huh.  That Stinky went to.  Yeah.  Stinky went to that school.  Stinky went to the gay middle school.  I knew it.  The gay middle school.  It's right around the corner from this house.  So what?  Oh, my God.  A gay kid came out of there.  So what does that mean?  I don't know.  The school's gay?  The school's gay?  It was at one point.  There's a pattern developing here.  Let's get Stinky in here for a sec.  Stinky, you went to that gay school? 
[00:27:00]  You went to the gay middle school.  Everyone's gay at that school.  I couldn't believe it.  I didn't see it, but.  Yeah.  Was anyone gay when you were in middle school?  Of course.  You know, we were in middle school.  No, but you don't.  It's gay people in school all the time.  Ones you know.  Ones you don't know.  You knew kids in middle school that were gay?  I didn't know them as far as like.  But you knew they were gay.  Oh, absolutely.  You didn't see kids that walk down the hall and you go, that kid's gay.  Yeah.  Whether he knows it yet or not.  He doesn't.  He's a choreographer. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  They usually, yeah, they help out in the plays.  They help out in the plays.  But they're not acting in it.  They're doing the, you know.  And one, two, step two, turn two, step two.  And I didn't even know in high school who was gay.  Swear to you.  I could say, well, a couple of the theater guys maybe, but I didn't know for sure.  That's what I'm talking about.  You knew for sure people, you knew for sure kids in middle school that were gay.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you saw them, they acted, what do you call, gay.  Well, Ann, did you say one of those kids, like when you were young or something, hit on you or something? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, that was in California.  And that was what, junior year or so?  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey, hey, gay.  Did he give you a mouthful of a treat, did he?  Ah, didn't get one.  Good for that, Jimmy.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Come on up.  Get a good one.  Get a good one.  Just a hug.  Yeah, now there are kids in school that you knew.  In middle school.  And you're like, ah, the kid's gay, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Uh-huh.  Absolutely.  No clue.  Well, you've got to be a little observant.  They were usually very neat.  Yeah.  Right.  Tiny people.  Well, very, very friendly with some of the teachers.  Mm-hmm.  Well-dressed.  Like that.  Well-dressed.  Right.  Tastefully appointed.  Right.  They would talk about things that the rest of the kids didn't talk about.  Yes.  You know, Broadway and whatnot.  The graffiti on the notebook was like cats.  There's a kid who knew everything about, right, Broadway.  Anyway, if you were in the play, Bye Bye Birdie, does that mean you were gay? 
[00:29:00]  Depends on what you were doing.  Were you the birdie?  Playing the girls.  If you were playing some of the Bobby Soxers, I was a little gay.  I sang a little.  Did you?  Really?  I was one of the singing teenagers there.  What kind of an abomination play was that?  That they got Opie singing it.  Were you really?  Did they give your little blonde locks a tussle?  A tussle?  I was one of the singers there.  Oh, yeah?  Really?  And I can't carry a tune.  In the chorus?  Yeah, we did.  We were in the chorus.  We had to sit in chorus.  The chorus in the band.  Work out the songs and stuff. 
[00:29:30]  Uh-huh.  He was in the chorus.  All right.  I had to sing and make believe I was on, you know, a telephone at the same time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's not even remotely gay.  That's very masculine.  Yeah.  It's fine.  Yeah.  Did you live with Paul Lynn for a couple of years?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, we got a clip of Opie on the phone at that time?  How's that for a tupper?  Oh.  Bye-bye, Barney.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:30:00]  Oh.  Why is Stinky off the hook?  He was gay in middle school.  He grew out of it.  Feelings all alone in the moonlight.  Stinky went to the gay school.  The gay middle school.  That's featured on the intro.  Yeah.  So now these kids are back at school and now everyone is discovering them as the, you know,  the people from the BJ girl or the gay guy. 
[00:30:30]  You know, all the teachers saw that.  Yeah.  And then they show the parents.  They had a whole group of parents that were in this, went into the middle school at night,  I guess, with a sex education teacher.  And the sex ed teacher is talking to them.  That was the last time she had sex.  I know.  Did you see her?  She looked like a guy from the gay school.  And she's sitting there and talking to these parents and saying things like,  what would be acceptable sexual behavior for your children at this age? 
[00:31:00]  And then you get like the, the parents of the daughter that was given the Hummers is like,  um, French kissing, like saying little things.  It's like, no.  How about deep throating?  Because that's what your, your gal is doing.  Brushing your teeth with a c**t.  Oh, no.  Wait, you can't say that, Hopi.  Brushing your teeth with that.  No.  I'm sorry.  You can't say that.  Did you learn that in the play?  Was that a portion of Bye Bye Birdie? 
[00:31:30]  Easy.  So we got some clips from middle school confessions.  The best part of the, uh, the group meeting though, quickly with the, the sex ed teacher  between the parents, the men, the fathers sitting there as they're asking these questions.  It's just like, I'm not hearing you.  La, la, la, la.  Because what guy, because the second she starts talking about, do you know, there are students  in this school practicing oral c**t, this, that, the other thing, blah, blah, blah.  What, I can't say that?  I can't say it? 
[00:32:00]  Just say oral.  I'm saying, mm, okay.  Practicing, uh, doing oral.  Please, like that matters.  Oh, you bunch of c**t.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I had a, I had a curse right there.  Oh, hold on.  I get so upset.  They're dumping out like crazy.  With what we have to say.  Well, you gotta protect the kids.  I know, exactly.  I guess we could say they're innocent.  We could say oral, but we can't say oral.  Oral.  Don't say that.  Yeah.  And you certainly can't say what Anne said.  No, no, no.  You can't say it, but if you go to middle school, you can experience it.  You can do it, right. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  So the fathers are just, they're getting these discussions, and you know, they're just images  conjured up of their lovely little young gals doing this.  When they interviewed the parents, did they know what the kids have said, or they just  asked?  Some of them kind of had an inkling because of notes they found in their clothing and stuff  like that.  But I don't think they knew until this special that, you know, the brace-faced chick is  is hoffing like crazy, and the other one, the 12-year-old that was getting the manipulation  by the boyfriend, and she was horrified. 
[00:33:00]  She's like, I found out because some anonymous twat sent her a note that ratted out the daughter.  And she's like, I got nauseous, and I got very nervous, and then when my daughter got  home, I addressed her, I gave her the note, and she said, it's true.  Oh.  So there's your little girl.  Daddy's little girl.  What a tattletale, that friend.  I know.  You're beeswax.  Isn't that awful?  Yeah.  Somebody, it was, it started, the note started, it takes a village. 
[00:33:30]  So, meaning that it takes everyone in the community to make sure everyone turns out  okay.  You know, that Hillary Clinton bullcrap that she was spreading.  My daughter got manipulated, now I'm dodging her.  Now I'm dodging her.  Oh, God.  I'll be in Cleveland, handing out bumper fakers.  Fuffering, fuck-a-tash.  I'm lost.  Hey, rabbit, you want to buy a dryer?  Go work.  So, is the setup good? 
[00:34:00]  Can we get to the clip?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We do have clips.  I believe this girl that you're about to hear is 12 or 13 years old, Anthony.  Oh, yeah?  12 or 13, right?  All right.  13.  13.  Tender age of 13.  One of, oh, gee.  Oh, gee.  No pointing.  I'm ready.  All right.  Here it is from HBO.  Middle School Confessions.  At parties, while I'm drinking and I'm having fun, I think I engage in more sexual things 
[00:34:30]  than I would normally.  Sometimes I get really wild.  Those were probably the most times that I've been taken advantage of by guys.  I have woken up in the morning and just been like, I can't believe I did that.  What's all that yelling in the back?  That party that they're at.  Yeah, they're at a party where it's nothing but kids.  What were these parties when I was 12 and 13 or something?  Where are they now?  Nothing but kids groping each other. 
[00:35:00]  This HBO thing, they had a camera around with 13-year-old kids just groping each other,  making out, copping feels, that one drunk girl on the couch clip.  There's a couple of guys sitting on the couch.  This drunk chick, her head falls right into his lap.  She rolls over.  You just see her eyes going, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo in her head.  She smashed.  Smashed at 12, 13.  Yeah, and this girl talking.  You heard what she just said.  That's any hose bag anyone's ever known in their life. 
[00:35:30]  And now instead of just maybe a few people in that school knowing, the country knows.  Because she said, you know, I got a party, I got a little drunk.  I wake up and go, who?  What did I do?  Who don't know a hose bag like that?  Isn't this great news, too, all you soccer mom twats?  It's happening to your kids.  Yeah, this, believe me.  They're drinking out of mules left and right.  Oh, O&A are bad people.  Don't let them listen to that.  Watch out for the video games and they're blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Good for you, involved parents.  You know something? 
[00:36:00]  You bring up a great point because this wasn't some inner city school with kids that were being neglected by their parents.  This was all middle to upper class white kids going to parties at these nice houses of their friends and stuff and just hob and knob.  Nice village you live in.  They, they, they're saying that, and you know something?  Even the slut ones are virgins.  They're saying, you know, hey, I didn't give that up.  You know, that's like a way to rationalize it.  They don't give that up. 
[00:36:30]  No, that would be wrong.  But, I mean, more, more icing than a strudel cake on their face on any given night.  You know, I think intercourse is wrong, but I would rather, you know, gobble the love snot.  That's fine.  That's it.  That's a treat.  That's what they're doing.  Because they can't tell them no to parents, well, I want to have communication with my, and they don't tell them no, and I'm glad they don't tell them no.  The more kids that do this, the happier I am.  I love it when these stupid parents are, that's why sitcoms suck, because I have to hear about your kids and what they're going to hear, and I love what they're doing behind your dumb soccer backs. 
[00:37:00]  Except for the job, Adam, the job.  No, that's not a sitcom.  I don't count that as a sitcom.  That's a dramedy on at 9.30 this evening on Channel 7.  Right.  It's a dramedy, man.  Drama and comedy.  That's not, that's not, that's not like a bunch of cutesy little dialogue, like, uh-oh, look like swimmers, though, and this stupid underdog.  You would have the 12-year-olds on the show.  Hey, Matt's a teacher.  Matt, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm a 7th grade teacher on Alan, and I am not surprised about any of this at all. 
[00:37:30]  What grade do you teach?  It doesn't matter.  7th.  7th or so?  All right.  7th grade, they're 12-year-olds.  The stuff they talk about in the hallways, guys, just blows my mind away.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm 25, and when I was in 7th grade, all I cared about was, like, baseball and Ikari Warriors on Nintendo.  No, I'm not going to go that far, because, obviously, everyone was very, very, you wanted to have sex at that age.  You're in middle school, and it's raging hormones, as they mentioned, and you wanted to have it. 
[00:38:00]  But, you know something?  It wasn't there.  It wasn't as easy.  No.  Oh, some people were getting it.  That's fine, you know, and you'd pick and choose and get some stuff here and there.  It's part of growing up.  I had nothing to pick and choose from.  But these parties that they were showing on this HBO special, where they're drinking and manipulating each other.  Dude, I lived four houses away from my middle school, when I was in, like, 7th, 8th grade, on lunch break, because I had a Rolodex going all day.  I would run home on lunch break, scrap, and then run back and feel guilty, like all the other kids know what I just did. 
[00:38:30]  You'd scrap.  Yeah.  That is great.  Scrap.  Yeah.  I would go home, and I would go back and feel like the other kids all knew what I just did.  But I would look and think of all the heinies I saw.  Filthy guy.  You.  Filthy.  Hey, you want to hear another clip from middle school conventions?  Yes.  We got plenty of these.  All right.  Blah, blah, blah.  Check this out.  We haven't been going out very long.  I mean, it was sort of my first time.  We were over at her house with, like, a whole group, and we were in a bedroom alone together. 
[00:39:00]  So things got kind of out of control, and we were making out and stuff, and he ended up going down my pants.  At first, they told him not to because I didn't want to, and then, but he did it anyway.  And, you know, it did feel good, and I did enjoy it.  Oh. 
[00:39:30]  By the way, the girl you just heard, 12 years old.  12.  What?  12.  12.  Psycho Mark.  What?  Where is she?  What's her number?  12.  Talking about going to parties.  Two.  Get in the room.  Now, this is stuff I absolutely recall happening at parties 15, 16.  Yeah.  At that age, you know?  Mm-hmm.  You're going to the party.  You're doing that.  12?  Yeah, no.  At 12, I distinctly remember a great day was a Bic lighter and plastic army men in the woods. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  Or a magnifying glass and an anthill.  And some bugs.  Sure.  We got to get Nick on the line here.  Nick, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What do you got?  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  How's it going, buddy?  I got a brother who's in middle school.  And a couple weekends, he's asked me to pick him up liquor.  He comes home the next day after sleeping over at Buddy's house. 
[00:40:30]  He's got better stories than I do on a weekend.  Yeah, right?  See?  And there were always girls that would do this in certain schools or anything.  But they were the ones with the bad rep.  You know, the rumors of the girl would be like that.  And it wouldn't be a lot of girls.  Now it just seems, oh, my God.  This is the...  If you could get a Hummer in junior high, you would have been king of the junior high.  And you would have to tell everyone. 
[00:41:00]  Because there's one girl, I think we're going to have her clip in a little bit.  She was surprised that the guy told everybody else at school.  Things changed.  Things flip-flopped.  Because I remember it was a lot easier to get laid than it was to get a Hummer back in the day.  When I was 12, I didn't even know they would do that.  Forget about even getting it.  Yeah, I didn't know that was part of the whole school.  You didn't know that was possible?  I didn't know that was one of the...  I was looking at hardcore pornographies.  I knew there was a world out there.  Yeah, exactly.  Eight years old, I'm looking at hardcore.  But you'd find it in the woods and it was rained on. 
[00:41:30]  With the color pages.  It was like all smutty black and white pictures.  And then in the middle, there were maybe six color pages.  With just nasty, hardcore C-shots all over the face and everything.  Right?  I used to steal Wii Magazine.  This is seventh grade.  Yeah, Wii and Penthouse out of a machine.  I would take a screwdriver and Jimmy the Machine and steal it.  And just go home and arc them all over myself.  You guys are acting like that. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, there was kissing in high school?  What are you talking about?  Those are the days you'd get a good magazine.  You'd go once and then follow it up right away.  Pia Zadora.  Keep going.  Oh, the Pia Zadora issue in the bathtub.  I don't remember.  Oh, yeah.  I remember the bathtub.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Pia Zadora.  Sure.  Kevin from D.C.  I don't know if this is true.  Kevin?  Hey, O&A, man.  What up, Morton?  Hey, sir.  Hey, I swear to God, guys, this is true.  It's about a year ago.  The kid was 14 years old, like a white suburban middle school in like a suburb of D.C. 
[00:42:30]  This kid was running a little prostitution ring out of his high school.  He had a handful of girls.  High school?  Or middle school.  Middle school.  14 years old.  So, what, about eighth grade or whatever?  Yeah, there you go.  Swear to God, he was running this prostitution ring.  He had about 10 girls, I guess.  Because I can see how kids that age would think it was cool and kind of fun and kinky and something you're not supposed to do.  Excuse me.  How much was he asking to see somebody?  Norton loves these quotes. 
[00:43:00]  Make sure they have a feminine back.  It's a large back for a gal.  How you doing?  We got our pleasure menu.  Would you like to see it?  Girls do enjoy tipping.  All right.  All right.  Want to hear what?  Troy from Jersey.  He's saying, at 12, didn't party mean you were going to the roller rink for someone's birthday and ice cream cake?  Hell yeah.  Now partying is...  Here's another clip from Middle School Confession. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  I think this is another 12 or 13-year-old, right?  12.  12.  I think, personally, the sexual things that you could do is, like, have a guy f*** you and you, like, maybe, like, give him a handy.  And, like, I think, like, it's okay, like, if, like, he fills you up and you guys, like, make out that, like, at this age.  But I just don't think it's okay, like, to go, like, all the way.  See, there's the rationale that was never in place when I was in school. 
[00:44:00]  It's perfectly acceptable.  There was either girls that did it or did not do it.  That's why you effed and you got the Hummer and you got the whole package, but it was very hard to get.  Now it's broken up a la carte.  The girls are a la carte.  I'm sorry.  We don't have the V.  We don't have V on the menu tonight, but we'd be happy to give you the Hummer and the Handy if you want to take that out.  And, well, let's see what's on the back of the menu.  Flip it over because that's acceptable, too. 
[00:44:30]  As long as the V is kept fresh.  Can I substitute the digital manipulation for the fries?  Yes, absolutely.  I'll write that down.  Let me check with the kitchen.  Even though it's a school night, is that possible?  Can I get something delivered?  So now it's all divvied up.  And the Hummer has turned into something that was akin to maybe making out.  Yeah.  You know?  Now it's like, hey, I don't go all the way, but, yeah, I'll throw you that.  Oh, jeepers.  Gee, you bitch. 
[00:45:00]  Who wouldn't be skipping la-la-la through the hallways the next day if girls were doing that?  I'm 35.  My last Hummer cost me a tennis bracelet.  All right?  Nice.  Yeah.  We have lots of these clips.  We'll play one more before we take a break.  All right.  What is this one?  Middle School Confessions from the HBO show.  This is a little clip about Oral.  Oh.  All right.  From a 12-year-old.  That's something new.  I think Oral is okay to do because it's not an intercourse, and I just feel that it's okay. 
[00:45:30]  I don't know why.  A foreign trooper.  Isn't that all?  Atta girl.  It's like a lot.  That makes me want to have kids.  Oh.  How much?  In what way?  That makes me want you to have kids.  I'm happy.  It's amazing.  Imagine the parties. 
[00:46:00]  These are kids.  I'll babysit, Norton.  These are kids that were on camera.  Nothing blocked out.  You didn't have any digitizing of the face or anything.  Not electronically, anyway.  And the parents of these girls that you just heard are on there talking about sex.  Is that something to do to your kid?  If she's doing it, hey, what are you going to do?  But then to splash it all over HBO, if I may use the term, splash. 
[00:46:30]  It just seems to me like you shouldn't be allowed to do that.  What's the bumper sticker say?  My kid's a hose bag.  Yeah, yeah.  Ask me about my slutty granddaughter.  Proud to be the parents of a receptacle.  My daughter gave a Hummer to an honor student.  Ask me about my sea dumpster. 
[00:47:00]  A girl can suck the color out of a marble.  Wow.  They seem very fine with this going on.  Hey, Paul, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, Ollie?  Hey, man.  Hey, I got the story.  My brother, he was 10 years old, and he had this little teeny bopper girlfriend.  Guess they were at her house, and their parents weren't there.  The girl starts giving him a Hummer.  My brother starts looking around like, what the hell is going on?  Oh, my God.  The kid had no idea what was going on.  The teeny bopper is giving away Hummers like Tic Tacs these days. 
[00:47:30]  Look at this.  Matt from Jersey has a whole timetable.  Yeah.  He goes, I'll settle things right now.  Here's the timetable.  12, Handies, 13, Hummers, starting of booze, at 14, you get the digits, and the lucky ones  have sex, booze way up, pot smoking starts, 15, more sex, booze, everyone smokes pot,  16, who hasn't at least gotten a Hummer at this point? 
[00:48:00]  And then he says, Hummers are like promotional tools today.  It's like a throwout, a promo that you throw out there to let people know what they're  in for.  Like a keychain.  Right.  It's a promotional tool.  It's a maglite flashlight with your phone number on it.  It's a good to know you.  Hey, how you doing?  Sally for class president.  It's like, how are you?  Yeah, those school elections must be something these days.  And we should take a break. 
[00:48:30]  When we come back, we got the clip, the virgin talking about how she's a virgin except for  her mouth.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  She's got a tattoo on her chin that says, Merging Traffic.  Beware.  Keep hands and feet away from the hopper at all times.  How much?  Middle school confessions continue on the Opie and Anthony Show, Dags.  Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  I want you to be free. 
[00:49:00]  Don't worry about me.  And just like the movies, we play out on the last scene.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  A big thank you to Buffalo today, Anthony.  Buffalo, you guys, you rock, man.  Buffalo gave us what Washington did it.  Yes. 
[00:49:30]  Washington gave us the clap yesterday.  Yeah.  But Buffalo, man, wow.  Buffalo was as sweet as a 12-year-old girl.  Oh, God.  And for our starring in The Job tonight, 9.30 on ABC.  ABC.  Season premiere.  Tonight's episode.  Sacrilege.  Sacrilege.  That's the Quinn Martin voice.  A Quinn Martin.  Epilogue.  Lisa wants in on this discussion. 
[00:50:00]  Lisa, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just have an opinion on why these young kids are doing some serious fooling around.  Yeah.  You think maybe your show has a little something to do with it?  Oh, yeah, that's what it is.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, I hope so.  Our show.  Our show has something to do with it.  You and everybody like you.  Don't you think you have a little something to do with it?  That's Lisa.  No, maybe it's parents that don't pay attention to their kids, don't do parenting, and blame  it on other things.  Or maybe it's just slutty hose bags.  Well, the guys are, too, from my opinion. 
[00:50:30]  I mean, they're looking for it.  A guy's idea?  I can't wait to think that's hot.  No, I don't.  That's supposed to sound sexy.  No, I think parents are very responsible, but I think it also helps when there's shows  like yours on the air.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  Don't listen, you twat.  Oh, you're so funny, guys.  How old were you?  Keep listening.  Sorry, me.  How old were you?  Lisa, you sound really stupid, because you're obviously listening to our show today.  Yep.  So, if we're not funny or entertaining, then why are you listening to the show?  Because I'm very intrigued by what you guys are talking about.  There you go.  There you go.  Thank you. 
[00:51:00]  Intrigued.  It's a really important subject.  Tell your friends.  Right.  It's an important subject.  Yeah.  Good luck to you and your pig children, stupid.  Oh, you're sweet, Norton.  I can see why more people like you.  Why do you talk with that stupid fat girl?  I know.  God, you hear that?  Hey, let's marry me.  Yes, I do.  Yes, stupid fat girl.  Yes.  You guys finished now?  No, stupid.  We're not finished now.  We're not your boyfriend, so you can't kick us around and inescalate us like the twat  you are.  Poor guys.  Are you finished now? 
[00:51:30]  That's funny.  Is that what your husband says?  Yeah.  Okay, guys, I'm finished.  Finished now?  Yeah, you are.  Hang up and suck.  Bye-bye.  See you.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Nice try, Lisa.  Nice try.  Bye-bye.  Keep listening, though.  Yeah.  Intriguing.  We certainly could use the listeners in the D.C. area.  That's the girl that scrubs the toilet right after you beat her.  That's what I like.  I listen because I'm intrigued.  I scrubbed because it was dirty and it hit me.  Ugh.  At least she knows my name, though.  She must be listening.  Gee, Lisa, you heard it.  Well, Jamie, she was like, yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Sorry, guys.  Oh, imagine having to go home to that voice.  Ugh.  So, I guess it wasn't important enough to do that.  You know, with the fake laughing lilt to the voice when she's pissed off and she puts  on that, well, why wasn't the long cut today?  I guess other things were too...  Bam in the face!  You know what that is?  That's trying...  That's passive-aggressive.  Yeah.  Because for many years, daddy snuck into the room at night, so you really never learn  how to express your anger at men.  Call back, stupid, and just say, it sucks. 
[00:52:30]  I hate you.  Have some courage.  Don't call up and try to be smarmy and smug.  You're not bright enough for it.  Yeah.  Smarmy.  Yeah, but that smugness is...  You've got to be really smart to pull that off.  And that lilt gave you away.  All right, more clips from Middle School Confessions, the show that was on HBO last  night, okay?  12, 13-year-old girls talking about stuff.  Yeah, this was some...  This is the virgin girl.  The virgin girl, Anthony.  Virgin girl.  How old? 
[00:53:00]  12, 13.  I think she's 13, this one.  Yeah.  13?  This is 13.  Listen, what's going on?  I never slept with anybody.  I'm still purely virgin, except for my mouth.  Cool.  I didn't hear that.  And it's got porno music in the background.  I didn't hear that.  Could you replay that?  I've never slept with anybody.  Never slept with anybody.  I'm still purely virgin, except for my mouth.  Okay.  Terrific.  And you know why? 
[00:53:30]  It's because of this show.  Yeah, that's it.  And it has MFP fluoride, so it's good for your teeth.  I hope it is because of this show.  You know how great that would be?  Yeah.  It's our show.  Chrissy!  Yes.  Hey.  I've got to tell you guys, thank you, because I've got a 13-year-old daughter, and I'm  now never letting her out of the house.  Are you dodging her?  Sorry, why?  You're not letting her out of the house?  Never.  No.  Thank you.  I didn't see this on HBO, and I'm sharing this now.  Chrissy.  I'm messing myself. 
[00:54:00]  Chrissy, do you know what she's up to, if anything?  I keep a pretty tight rein on her, so yeah, I think I know what she's up to.  You know something?  Listen, so did these parents, man.  I watched this special, it's like, oh my God.  Does she go over to a friend's house?  Of course she does.  Does she ever spend the night?  Yes, she does.  Get her jaw wired.  Do you know?  Don't.  Don't even say it.  Does she have friends that maybe you'd prefer she didn't hang out with?  Not anymore.  Not anymore. 
[00:54:30]  She did.  Not anymore.  She did.  She used to hang out with them.  There were a couple of girls that I put my foot down.  You got it?  She fell in with a fast crowd.  No, not anymore.  No, huh?  No, no.  And what's the worst thing that you caught her doing?  I haven't caught her doing anything really bad.  But at this point, her and her girlfriends that she's around now, they talk about having  crushes on boys.  Crushes.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, any house parties that she goes to, there's parents there. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  And anything else is a school activity.  House parties at 13.  House parties.  I went to the roller rink.  All right.  Well, looks like Chrissy's doing a good job.  That's true.  She's doing the best she can.  Godspeed and good luck to you.  Good luck.  Thank you, guys.  I mean it.  Thank you for playing this.  All right, Chrissy.  Well, this next clip is going to make you drive off the road, so hold on tight, all right?  All right.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Well, this is a girl talking about Oral Anthony.  All right.  12, 13.  13.  13. 
[00:55:30]  With Oral, it's really kind of fun to do because when the guys get it, they kind of give you  more attention for it and they're really happy with you and stuff like that.  They're happy with you.  And they give you more attention.  They learn young.  Yeah.  That's a healthy home life.  Jesus.  Boy, I hope...  They give you more attention.  Boy, I hope Sandy's listening.  Oh, my God. 
[00:56:00]  She's going to slap your face, man.  You know what's sick?  I'm going to ask my girlfriend.  Now you got to punch him.  Now I got to punch him.  You got to punch him.  Not hard this time.  But that's actually a good point.  The kid raises a good point.  Yeah.  You want love and attention?  Well, what are you bringing to the table?  Hey!  You know, a lot of these girls, I think some of the clips they play later, they're saying  this, that they don't want the guys to do anything to them.  They don't want...  They don't want to receive... 
[00:56:30]  They don't want to be left alone.  They just want to give the Hummers.  Right.  Because, you know something?  If you're a guy and you're laying back and you're getting that, and believe me, at that  age especially, how thankful you are at that, that girl is a goddamn princess right there.  What she's doing.  And they can see it in the way you're lifting your ass off the couch.  You know what I mean? 
[00:57:00]  So, of course, they're going to dig doing it.  Pulling lint out of your ass.  Yeah.  More commentary on oral, Anthony.  Where's the upholstery go?  Oral in the middle schools.  Ah, right.  From middle school confessions from HBO.  My boyfriend and I were going out for about six months before I gave him...  And we liked each other a lot.  It was kind of like, I can't believe I did that, but after, I was like, okay, that's cool. 
[00:57:30]  Little giggles.  I like when they giggle.  Unfortunately, they giggle right when you take your pants down.  It's not good.  And they point and squint.  Where is it?  Things like that.  Point and squint.  Nothing like a fond, girlish giggle, though.  It looks like one only smaller.  When they say that, it's bad.  One day that'll get hair.  You know, it's just... 
[00:58:00]  Awful.  Awful.  It's amazing...  What?  ...that they put this on TV.  What are the parents thinking?  That's what they're saying about our radio show out there, eh?  I'd be like, you know something?  It's amazing.  They put this on TV.  Hey, I'm all for it.  And I'm not talking about telling HBO they shouldn't air this.  Right.  Or any kind of censorship.  I'm talking about parenting and going, if you get a kid that's saying this on TV, in front of a camera,  and you then sign a release that says, yeah, fine, because the kid can't sign the goddamn release. 
[00:58:30]  The parents got to sign it.  Can't?  It'll be in crayon.  The parents got to sign it.  Oh, yeah.  Put my daughter talking about how she hobs it on television.  I'm sure it's going to be great for the father when he goes to the office on Monday.  It's not like HBO's catching on or anything.  I don't think the neighbors have it.  Hey, Tom, isn't tomorrow bring your daughter to work day?  Hey, hey, I'll bring the lube. 
[00:59:00]  Bring your daughter to work day tomorrow there, Bob.  I saw your daughter on HBO last night.  We're all eagerly awaiting by the water cooler.  What's it?  Bring your little whore hose bag to work day tomorrow.  Stupid parents allow this.  Very stupid.  Stupid parents.  I'm thankful that they're so stupid.  This one's going to make some moms drive off the road, Anthony.  The next clip from Middle School Confessions.  Okay.  More about oral.  People think that, like, that's going way too fast. 
[00:59:30]  But a lot of people are doing it now.  I kind of wanted to create a closer relationship with my boyfriend.  But then he kind of thought that once he got it once, he's going to get it often.  And it got us closer.  But we broke up after.  Oh, he dumped her afterwards, huh?  He thought he was going to get it all the time.  You know, God damn. 
[01:00:00]  It's a lot like marriage.  She gives it until once and it's like, come on.  It's been five minutes.  Ladies, don't you know that's like feeding a puppy?  You know when you put milk outside the door?  That dog ain't leaving.  Right.  And where would she record this?  A daycare?  What was going on in the back?  I know.  Did you hear the background?  One of the house parties.  That was a, yeah.  They went into one of these house parties.  That was a little house party going on as they're talking about oral.  Woo.  How about that?  But I thought my daughter was going to see Harry Potter. 
[01:00:30]  They said they were going to go see Harry Potter.  Harry Potter?  I didn't know.  Harry Potter.  Harry Potter and the saucer's bone.  I never had reason to doubt her before this.  Harry Potter.  The parents love when we do stuff like this.  They love stories like this.  Vinny.  Yo, what's up, man?  What's up?  I got a 13-year-old son and a 17-year-old son.  The only part is like the first time you catch him having sex, the first thing that goes to your mind is, oh, no.  And then the second thing that goes to your mind is, oh, thank God, they're not gay. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, there you go.  It's like totally different.  If I had a daughter, tonight she'd be like handcuffed in the basement.  I'd be concreting over the door.  She'd never get out.  But your 13-year-old, you know, has had sex already?  Well, I know he's gotten something from somebody because his friends called him up one day and he's like, yeah, she was hot.  She tasted nice, too.  Nice.  She's getting a little something.  That could be anything, though.  Maybe a little nuzzle on the neck. 
[01:01:30]  I don't know.  It got a little more graphic than that.  I can't quite explain it to you.  You heard that from your 13-year-old?  Yeah.  He was talking on the phone.  Good boy, though.  He's going south already.  He's a team player that day.  That's nice.  Well, I got a 17-year-old son in the backseat of my friggin' Mercedes in the goddamn garage.  I go downstairs to get like a friggin' 12-pack out of the garage.  I open up the light case and all I see is a pair of feet up against the windshield and then a pair of **** pop up behind the mic. 
[01:02:00]  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on, because you can't say the T word.  Danger.  Danger.  Just saw her feet up on the windshield and a pair of her T's.  Yeah, it just popped up, and I was like, the first day it came to him, I was, he's having  sex, and then it was like, but he's not gay.  Yeah.  Thank God, he's not gay.  Do we have the clips from the middle school gay guys?  All right.  Hey, that girl...  I got to go.  You're talking about gay stuff.  I don't even want to think about that.  All right, Vinny.  Vinny, the girl he was with didn't have a big back, did she? 
[01:02:30]  No, but she had a nice rack.  All right, Vinny.  Thank you.  Vinny's right.  My big sex talk from my father?  Yeah.  My father walked in my room and went, Adam, don't kiss guys, huh?  Please.  Jesus Christ.  That was the sex talk.  That was it.  Big Joe.  Big Joe.  Our buddy Nick Carter checking in.  Nick.  Holy effing animals, man.  Did you see this special?  Dude, you got to give it to HBO.  Between this show and Oz, you can almost experience a weekend at Norton's house. 
[01:03:00]  Exactly.  Of course, from the comfort of your own home.  And the safety.  You know, and the amazing thing about it, like I heard you talk about this earlier, they  didn't digitize any of the faces.  No.  You know every single one of these kids is going to be reliving this show on an analyst  couch for years to come.  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  Not only that, think of the action they're going to get now that it's been splashed all  over cable television, HBO, that they're goers, man.  What about?  Oh, yeah.  You know, they're going to be checking in their email, you know, do-do-do-do-do-do-do. 
[01:03:30]  Did we have anything, any extra credit homework?  Hey, what are you doing later on?  All right.  Sony or TV appearance?  Yeah.  I'm a 38-year-old man, and I thought you were so hot on HBO.  33.  Of course.  And that's the neighbor.  What is it?  The Grand Theft Auto 3 tournament over the house.  How about if you come over for a little bit?  Yeah.  I mean, just for a second, go back to elementary school.  I mean, think about it.  I mean, you know, I mean, it was a good night. 
[01:04:00]  At the end of the night, if you went to a dance, you had your hands on some girl's ass.  Yeah.  That was about it.  I know.  I mean, now you feel like a loser if you didn't get laid.  And if you'd known any of this was going on then, why would you even try to progress to high school?  You'd stay in middle school.  I went to plenty of parties at that age.  And parties that, you know, there was some drinking going on.  Right.  But nothing.  Nothing like they were talking about last night.  Going into rooms with the Hummers and stuff.  Nothing like that.  I was talking about this briefly earlier today on the show. 
[01:04:30]  And I'm like praying to the fertility God.  Should the day come that I ever do have kids?  If I have a little girl, I'm going to kill myself.  Yeah.  I don't know how guys with girls that are 13, 14 are even dealing with life.  You've got to figure it.  You've got to figure it.  Every single kid, especially little girls under the age of, I would say, even 15 now, they're grounded for life.  Even, you know, even the Wallflowers.  Anybody who saw that show, nope, you're not getting out of the house.  Sorry.  You just know.  Plans are canceled until you're 30. 
[01:05:00]  Any time if you're a father, and I can't even imagine, you know, and I don't want to.  If you're a father of a girl that age and you've raised her all those years, and then you hear things and just are picturing her doing those things to some filthy sea, it's just like, it's got to kill you, guys.  Guys, it's got to kill you.  Well, my first thought was, you know, my first thought was these kids, especially the little girls, especially the girl, the poor little thing with the braces. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm like, does she even realize what she's saying?  No.  She will a couple of years from now.  Yeah.  Somebody sits down and explains it to her.  She just looks at this tape and says, oh, my God, what have I done?  Daddy, with the same eyes, she looked at you all happy when you gave her that first Barbie doll on her birthday, as she was wearing the little I'm eight-year-old tiara on her head, princess dress for her birthday.  It's the same eyes that are now spinning around giving the fish eye as you're killing the fathers today, man. 
[01:06:00]  As she's getting a load of tapioca on the back.  Every father driving home now, God damn it, I should have just given her a pony.  All right, Nick.  All right, boys, I'm going to go bathe in holy water and try to redeem myself.  Yeah, sure.  Right on.  There he goes.  Our buddy, our pal, Nick Carter.  God damn.  From Boston.  Isn't that just awful to think?  And the father's out there right now.  I don't know how you're driving with both hands over your ears going, no, no, no, no.  La, la, la, la, la.  Hey, Danny, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:06:30]  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  A couple years ago, I was in my parents' house, and I pick up the phone.  This is what I hear.  I hear my brother talking to his girlfriend.  And he goes, she goes to him, next time, I want to do it to you in the shower.  Guys, do it 12 years old.  Do it to you in the shower.  That's great.  There you go.  12 years old.  But it's like Matthew McConaughey said in Days of Confused.  That's what I love about these girls.  I get older, they stay the same age.  Oh, shit.  It's easy, guys.  Thank you, Danny.  Remember Daniela, the last girl that did the wiffle ball bat challenge, Anthony? 
[01:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's on the line.  Daniela.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  What's up?  Actually, I think I have something to, like, blow all you guys away.  Oh, oh, away.  Good.  Okay.  Like, all these girls, like, all right.  Yeah.  The first time I ever kissed a girl, like, a heavy kissing girl, I was in kindergarten.  And you had her milk money.  Kindergarten?  I was, like, five or six years old.  What the hell possessed you guys to do that?  You know what's funny?  Like, everyone...  There were no wiffle ball bats around. 
[01:07:30]  That could be something you saw on television.  You're imitating.  Was it?  No, I'm serious.  Like, I would go...  She would call in my house, and we would, like, just start getting it on.  In kindergarten?  I was five years old.  What was...  If you remember, please let us know, what was in your mind?  What the hell, like, made you do that?  I don't know.  Like, I just found her so attractive.  And, like, just one thing led to another.  I remember I used to go over to her house, and we used to, like, do things.  She used to come over to my house.  We used to do things.  It was, like, a, like...  Like, it went on for, like, three weeks. 
[01:08:00]  And then she moved to Florida.  A whirlwind affair.  A whirlwind affair.  But I still remember her fondly.  We were...  Like, now I'm listening to, like, 13-year-olds talk about how they do oral and stuff like that.  But, like, I think that's a beautiful thing.  Like, you know, if you're going to explore your sexuality like that, that's fine.  Hey, so, were you like that at 13 or something?  Oh, yeah.  You were given the oral.  Oh, definitely.  And I was receiving it, too.  I think it's a beautiful thing, really.  Jumping Jehoshaphat.  How about that?  Look, everyone is silent looking around. 
[01:08:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  What the hell?  What the hell is going on?  I don't get...  What a...  Five.  So, like, what were you guys, like, at 13?  Like, it's, like, it's something you do.  I was nowhere near that stage.  I was whacking my bag.  Yeah.  I was just introducing myself to myself.  Wow.  That was about it.  Yeah, I was locked in my...  I had a towel in my room I could use as a lamp stand.  But that's horrible.  You should have went out.  Like, I'm sure if you guys went out and looked for girls to do that, they would have done  it for you.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  No, we're guys.  Sure, sure.  That ain't sure.  I was...  Them is getting rid of all that evidence and the police coming over to investigate. 
[01:09:00]  Duct tape.  Garbage bags.  What are you going to do?  I'm not digging a hole.  Look, I'm not saying there was all kinds of experimentation going on with the girls.  There was, like, the kissing stuff.  But at five years old, I mean, you like a girl, you just push them.  You know, that's...  Yeah, that's fine.  I kissed a girl.  Yeah, I know you did.  We listened.  I am talking.  I remember when I was...  It had to be, I mean, eight years old or something, making out in the basement of  the apartment complex with a girl. 
[01:09:30]  And it was like, you know, that might as well have been sex, because it's all I know.  Was she running her fingers through your afro?  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  My Angela Davis afro.  All right.  Coward to the people afro.  Thank you, Danielle.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Young Lawrence Hilton Jacobs finds love.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  How many more clips we got?  We only got three more to go.  Another clip on, well, what a surprise, oral.  More oral in middle school.  Giving a s*** has nothing to do with your body.  They don't have to see you or feel you or judge you in any way. 
[01:10:00]  It's kind of like you're in control and stuff.  I think I'd feel more comfortable with somebody that I wouldn't know, because if I did it  wrong, it's okay, because I'm not going to see you again.  Wow.  Okay.  All she had to say to that was a silver Saturn.  Oh, Jesus.  That was that girl with the braces again.  She's the 13-year-old with the braces talking about how, hey, she likes doing it. 
[01:10:30]  The guys don't have to touch her or see her body or anything like that, because she said  she's a little self-conscious.  And she prefers it with people she doesn't know, because if you do it wrong, it doesn't  matter.  You don't have to see them again.  She's a glory hole.  Jesus.  Yeah.  A glory hole with shoes.  That's it.  It is.  A glory hole with a bus pass.  Yeah.  A traveling glory hole.  And for some reason, the parents felt it was perfectly fine to put her on television. 
[01:11:00]  Very important that their daughter...  That their daughter talk about what a whore slut she really is.  How do you...  Well, honey, I wanted her to take dance lessons, but if you think this is good for her, I'll sign  the release.  I'll sign away.  She wants to act.  So she said she sucks what?  Okay.  I'll write that okay.  Fine to air.  Go ahead.  Fine to air.  There you go.  That's my gal.  She doesn't see her 13-year-old girl, and especially being the youngest in the family, 
[01:11:30]  she sees me as being the baby, I think.  And sometimes I feel as though I'm being treated like a baby, so I don't want her to know any  of the things that I do that are not so good.  Yeah, treated like a baby.  Here's your binky.  I think you need your binky.  And one more clip.  I feel like I've completely lost all my innocence.  When you're a little girl, you're like, when you see kids on TV, it's like, ugh.  And like when you do it, you're like, mm-hmm.  Being intimate and oral with guys, it's just like you're not that little girl that wears 
[01:12:00]  hair and piggie tails and ate a cake with soft skin all over her face.  But, you know, you can't change the past, so I guess there's nothing I can do about it.  That's the beginning of a porno movie.  Yeah.  It goes to music and everything.  The music goes into a dream sequence, and it goes in on the strippers.  All you need is Max Hardcore.  That's it, you lady.  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Either that or the other video collection where you write the C word on her forehead and smack  her in the face.  But Max Hardcore is the originator of that guy, the whole, uh...  That genre.  That genre.  What was that series called?  That was called Slap Happy.  Slap Happy.  I'm sorry, Jim Norton.  Silly me.  Tim, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Uh, long-time listener, second-time caller.  Uh, I've got a three-month-old, and what you guys are, a three-month-old daughter, and  what you guys are talking about is absolutely scaring the hell out of me. 
[01:13:00]  And you got a good four or five years before you have to start worrying, according to some  of our friggin' callers.  I think I'm going to go over and get the stapler out and staple up a few things.  Holy, yes.  I don't know what you could possibly do, aside from moving to some barren wasteland in Alaska,  and then she'd probably come home with a moose.  I'm just thinking there's nothing a guy can do if you have a daughter, and because they  come from the best of homes, they come from the worst of homes, the parents think they're  doing a good job, the parents are doing a crappy job, and they wind up becoming doctors 
[01:13:30]  and whatever.  They do a great job.  They rebel against the parents because they're giving them too much, and they become hosebags.  There's no rhyme or reason to it, my friend.  You just effed up, and one of those Y chromosomes or something kind of...  Being a good parent helps someone.  Well, it's certainly scary. You also remember when you were 14 trying to do anything and  everything possible.  Of course.  And it's only gotten worse.  You have a daughter, that's for sure.  You remember knocking on some guy's door and asking for his daughter when you were a  kid?  Never did that. 
[01:14:00]  Sorry, she's not home right now.  I know the struggle. She's dodging me, too.  All right, Tim, thank you.  Hey, guys, have a good day.  Bye.  You stay in this room.  I'm going to Cleveland to hand out stickers.  You're not leaving until I get back.  What's up there, Psycho Mark?  No, I was going to say, the parents are morons.  Who would ever put their daughter on national team?  Retards.  That's the point we're making.  Retards.  Yeah, that, apparently, you can see where they went wrong.  I think it helped the situation, right?  Right.  Right.  There are some really hot stories coming in on Instant Feedback, but we're trying to 
[01:14:30]  show some responsibility today with this subject.  Dana from Cleveland.  So she became active at 10, digitally, and at 11, orally, with girls, 14, lost it to a boy.  This is all on the Instant Feedback.  And 17, became oral with boys.  Hey, let's take a break. 
[01:15:00]  Let's take a break, everyone.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  No, they're no freaks.  That's the name of a day.  That's the name of a day.  That's the name of a day.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  That's the name of a day.  Yo.  Yo. 
[01:15:30]  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else.  Including Buffalo, New York.  Buffalo.  When do we get word on Buffalo?  Buffalo ratings tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  866-2774.  Wow.  Goddamn Buffalo.  And if you have any FUs, go to opieandanthony.com for the FU line number.  All right?  Hey.  Anthony.  Anthony.  The blow me line. 
[01:16:00]  Jackie Fine is on the line.  Jackie Fine on the line.  And she's Jackie.  Jackie.  Yeah, Jackie.  Hey.  Jackie Fine.  Hey, you guys.  Hey.  Hey.  You remember talking to us about a year ago?  Oh, how could I forget?  What's up, baby?  How could I forget?  Yeah.  Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  Yeah, baby.  Did you guys get the email that I got from one of your listeners? 
[01:16:30]  Uh, I don't know.  What did they say?  Well, you have to have Rick to show it to you.  What's up?  It was really cute.  What was it, baby?  So, what's going on?  So, how's New York?  New York's all right.  Good.  Or should I say, it's like...  You're right.  It's doing okay.  Now, Jackie, uh, remind the audience, and me, what, uh, your book, uh, is about.  Book, video, CD, Viacream. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, the cream.  Yes, I had the Viacream.  I forgot about the cream.  Wasn't that like the...  Remember the cream?  That was like the Viagra cream for the...  Hello, Jackie?  Jackie, where did Jackie go?  Jackie, phone call, got knocked the M out.  What happened?  We didn't even say anything bad yet, and she hung up.  There she is.  She's back.  All right.  Jackie, fine.  She's Jackie.  Jackie!  What are you guys doing?  What happened?  No, I...  You know something?  I know.  I gotta say...  Hold on.  Let me tell you something, Jackie. 
[01:17:30]  Especially our audience.  I gotta...  We might even pull crap like that sometimes.  But we gotta get to the meat of a conversation before we hang up on people.  That was really something went amiss there.  I got you.  Something went a little awry.  I got you.  Now, Jackie, you were talking about your cream.  I was talking about my cream.  Jackie cream.  Candy.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Please hold the phone there, Jackie.  We can't be that in-depth in our description of what this cream is. 
[01:18:00]  We know what the cream is for.  It's for the little man on the boat.  Exactly.  Yeah, let's just call him that.  The little man on the boat.  Okay.  You rub the cream on his little head.  Yeah.  And what is...  And you rub it on his little head, and he gets excited.  Mm-hmm.  He starts to get wet.  Mm-hmm.  And he stands at attention.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  That's right, bro.  But if your audience doesn't, you know, don't recall who I am...  Let's just put it this way.  It turns a four into a six. 
[01:18:30]  Can I give them a little bit of background information on this?  Yeah, you do that, Jackie.  Okay.  Well, for the past 14 years, I've worked with the American Institute of Human Abilities,  and I'm a part of a group of sex and relationship experts...  Ah, yeah.  ...that have spent the last 35 years helping couples and individuals improve their sex life.  Yeah.  And we created a series of videos that illustrate our research for His Eyes Only and Her Eyes Only.  In the back.  Yeah.  The ultimate sexual experience.  Oh, man.  The ultimate guide to making a relationship work. 
[01:19:00]  And the one that's, you know, getting ready to come up is the ultimate Valentine.  Keep talking.  Yes.  What we basically do is take a frozen relationship...  Joy, chef!  ...with people who are looking to make the romance in their relationship...  Joy, chef!  ...translation boy.  ...and ways to do that.  Yes, I bet that, baby.  So now they read your book.  They see the video.  What is this going to do for somebody?  It improves their relationship.  It gives them different things that they can do. 
[01:19:30]  For example, for His Eyes Only and Her Eyes Only, we have 26 different sex positions that you can try.  Because oftentimes people will say, you know, that they need some variety.  I know one!  In and out!  In their relationship.  But all of these can be seen at JustAskJackie.com.  I'm sorry?  Jackie Fine.  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position out of 26?  He's such a chowder head.  My favorite position?  Yeah.  If I told you, I'd have to kill you. 
[01:20:00]  No one's pointing to his crotch again.  He's going, look, he's sporting.  You'll let you dig in this.  I got like six and a half dollars.  He's fooling.  He's fussing with himself.  Jackie Fine, why won't you tell us your favorite sexual position?  Yeah, Jackie.  If I did, I'd have to kill you.  No, no, baby.  I'll tell you mine.  It's that cowgirl thing where, like, top and backwards thing.  Nice.  Uh-huh.  I like the way Jackie looked in her book.  I can just picture that propping that ass up. 
[01:20:30]  Looked like two fine eggplants next to each other.  Yeah.  Well, it's Jackie Fine, Anthony.  She's Jackie.  Jackie.  You're a diva.  Jackie's a diva.  Are you guys looking at my website?  Yeah.  That's why we're saying she's Jackie.  I'm looking.  Hold on.  Let me take a look there, baby.  Jackie?  Let me see.  www.jackiefine.com or just as Jackie?  Mm-hmm.  Just as Jackie.  There she is.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:21:00]  Turn around.  Jackie Fine, so I can see how Jackie is.  How Jackie.  Look how Jackie she is.  Yeah, baby.  That's good.  You got any junk in the trunk?  Jackie, you got some junk in the trunk?  Do you have junk in the trunk?  Me?  No.  But I like a girl with some junk in the trunk.  I like especially a fine African princess such as yourself.  I like her ass to look like about 500 pounds of chewed Tootsie Roll. 
[01:21:30]  And then you just spit it out, mold it into a fine air.  Get me pumping.  What's your favorite position?  Come on, Jackie.  I know you guys got to have something more interesting to ask me than my favorite sex position.  Ask Washington.  No, we don't.  Well, you said there's 26 positions.  26.  What if we guessed it?  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Reverse cowboy?  I'm waiting.  Wait, we'll get three guesses? 
[01:22:00]  Yes.  Is that fair?  Sure.  But you got to play along.  If we guessed it, you got to tell us.  Okay.  And then you get free plugs on the Opie and Anthony show for 18 cities.  Right.  Well, actually 17 and Washington.  Mm.  17 and one crime-ridden dump.  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm waiting.  No, no.  Don't take it out on them.  All right, Jackie.  I'm going to start.  Okay.  Fine black lady like yourself.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to have to go with Doggy. 
[01:22:30]  Doggy?  Yeah.  No.  Jackie is much more classy than Doggy.  Doggy with the reach around.  No.  Okay, so that's the first one.  Okay, what's the second one?  Wait, wait.  No, you guys.  No, I want to hear what the other three is.  Jackie will tell you that Doggy doesn't really reach the good areas on a woman.  That's why you do the reach.  Oh, that's not true.  Oh, sure.  But let me tell you, the reach around adds the icing on the cake.  Here's my guess, Jackie. 
[01:23:00]  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Any position as long as he got benefits.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.  I think that the third one would be the good one.  Yeah, what have you done for me lately?  Oh, wow, man.  Jackie, Jackie, we got to know the favorite dog position.  Then we can move on with some of this other stuff here. 
[01:23:30]  That was it.  He did it.  Jackie, ain't nothing going on but the rent.  I can see Jackie taking that picture on her website and looking at it and just going,  God damn, I look good.  I got to tell you, I look good.  Mm-hmm.  You look like a classy lady.  Well, thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Jackie, you might be helping out a lot of people out there with your favorite sexual position.  But he guessed it.  Oh, see, you're going with the gag.  No, my favorite position, I don't particularly have it. 
[01:24:00]  I like, you know, a variety.  Like what?  You know, my favorite, one of my favorites would be the reach around.  Ah, yeah.  I mean, that is very good.  But then, you know, I like, you know, variety.  I like to try new things.  Yeah.  Hey, would you ever let a white guy do you?  Have you had any diversity in the races of men that you've had?  Mm-hmm.  Because I hope he's always scoping for a black chick.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Is he?  He ain't getting one, though. 
[01:24:30]  That's a god's honest truth, too.  Well, you know what they say.  What?  The black of the berry, the sweet of the juice.  Mm-hmm.  Really?  Do they say that?  Oh.  Who's they?  Yeah.  And how much time are they serving?  Huddle-a, huddle-a.  You guys are bad.  Ain't that bad.  But you guys don't want to ask me any questions about the videos or about sex other than my sex life?  You're fat, Jackie.  I am not.  I mean, fat.  P-H-A-T.  Like, I like hanging with you.  You're fat. 
[01:25:00]  It's Jackie Fine, Anthony.  She's...  Jackie.  Your sexual preference is important, though, because if you're writing a book about sex,  what you're about sexually does count, not even in a perverted way, but it does mean something  if your own sexuality is satisfying.  Who cares?  This is very true.  Now, let me tell you, there is nothing more exciting to a man than a happy, turned-on woman  that he doesn't have to fix.  Well, you're disillusioned.  That initiates lovemaking.  Yeah.  No S, Einstein.  That is very attractive to a man.  Nothing better than that reaching down for that crank, huh? 
[01:25:30]  Yes.  We love it.  Hey, why does the cream work so well?  Why does it...  Mainly because of the ingredients in it.  A little Bengay or something?  No, it's L-argining and menthol.  African Yo-Himbi bark?  Hey, I was almost right, menthol.  And one of the things that happens when a woman gets older is there's a serious drop  in her libido, and she has a problem with lubrication, and this helps in that area.  Yeah, that's hot.  Oh, no, it's not.  And then the way that it's applied is very fun, too. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, with what?  A roller?  A fist.  What is a fist?  You rub it in right below the little man in the boat.  It takes about five to 15 minutes.  Sound like my jaunt writers.  Yeah, that's good stuff, right?  So you rub it in, and, you know, something tells me you can rub in water, and it's going  to feel good.  Then she quees and tries to blow out a birthday candle.  How does it work?  It's the menthol.  No, it's not just the menthol, because, you know, the menthol isn't going to cause her 
[01:26:30]  to become lubricated the way that this will.  Find out more.  I'm on your website.  I'm trolling this thing like crazy.  Are you?  I'm finding out more about you.  You know, your listeners can also ask me questions up there.  You see that?  Can they ask you a question?  Well, we got one of our listeners that wants to ask you a question.  All right.  Let me go to ask you.  We can also give specials on the videos in the Viacream up there.  You see that?  Your website says, Just Ask Jackie.  Just ask.  If they want to.  What?  Just ask.  That's what I said.  Just ask Jackie. 
[01:27:00]  So we're going to have some listeners ask you a question.  Okay.  Oh, look.  Now your website's getting hit so much that I can't even get to all the things about  the cream.  Hey, Slim Dog said that he tried your product and it worked.  Oh, yeah.  For real.  Oh, yeah.  Slim Dog.  It's some good stuff.  Yeah, what's up, man?  What's up?  How you doing there, Jackie?  Yo, listen, Norton.  Take a hint, man.  Her plugs work.  You know?  What?  Nice.  Now, yo, that cream works.  Yeah.  I've used it.  My wife and I have used it.  I wrote you, Jackie.  You sent it. 
[01:27:30]  I swear about it, though.  Try it out.  I'm not playing.  It works.  Oh, wow.  That's good.  What happened to your lady after this cream thing?  Put it like this, though.  It just increased.  You do less work.  That's why it works.  Oh, yeah.  For the man, you do less work when you use it.  And any excuse to do less work.  Ah, come on.  Like, you don't try.  I didn't say nothing.  And then he seems like he's not into working anyway, so, you know.  What, me?  This is perfect for him.  I'll get my frank on, baby. 
[01:28:00]  Let me tell you something.  All right, Slim Dog, thank you.  Can I ask Slim Dog a question, mister?  Yeah, go ahead, Noah.  When you put it on the man on the boat, did it get bigger?  Yeah, it did.  Like she said, it took a couple of minutes to work, man.  But, you know, when you're downtown, after a while, you notice she's reacting a little more than what you usually do.  Exactly.  And like I'm saying, it does work.  Your frequency increases.  You know, you don't have to beg as much.  Dude, it works.  So, what percentage do you think that it cut the begging down to? 
[01:28:30]  I'd say at least 35, yeah.  Wow.  At least 35%.  Wow.  You know.  Wow.  Nice.  Man, Jack, you're fine.  Nice.  Thanks, Slim Dog.  All right, now.  You guys suck.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  Slim Dog, can I maybe borrow some of that cream?  No, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Damn.  I'll tell you what.  I'll come down to the studio and drop you all off some tomorrow if you want.  No, my brother. 
[01:29:00]  You've got to buy your own.  All right, Slim.  Later.  Later.  So, Jackie, are we pushing the cream today or the book?  What are we doing?  Or the videos.  Well, your listeners will get a special.  If they order the videos, they get the cream.  Yeah, but the videos are boring, all right?  Are you kidding?  You've got the couples doing it in your videos?  Yes.  There's 26 different positions.  Are you kidding?  That stuff is hot.  Hey, where'd you get that videotape?  I got it from a Negro.  Negro.  I'm going to send you guys both videos. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  I bet you couldn't even.  And I want you to tell me if you can see the difference in the beginning of the first  one and the beginning of the second one.  Oh.  How about that?  I bet you can't even name all the 26 positions.  I'm willing to bet you, Anthony, you're going to spot it.  Yeah.  It's something very different.  Do they show close-ups?  Yes, they do.  Is it hardcore?  It's not hardcore.  It's educational.  There's an enlarged view of the female reproduction area. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, is there?  That's all I need.  It's showing you how to touch, where to touch, in order to give you the most intense pleasure  in your partner.  Do they show the man on the boat?  Yes, they do.  Nice.  Any bukkake?  Bukake.  I'll tell you one complaint that we got.  We got this 70-year-old guy who ordered the video, and he was upset because he says,  I can't do that stuff.  That's gymnastics.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  He was very upset.  Yeah.  Look at you with the jokes.  Did you laugh and tell him to have a stroke?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right, Jackie Fine.  Jackie Fine, your website's getting pounded right now.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, they probably want to call the 800 number.  Can I give it a call?  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  The 800.  1-800-622-8454.  Can I put that on? 
[01:31:00]  Can I call that on my calling card?  That's 1-800-622-8454.  Yes, you can call it on your calling card.  Anything else you want to get out today there, Jackie Fine?  Well, I'd love to see you guys when I come to New York.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I am dying to meet you in person.  That's what I'm talking about.  Can people order your products, Jackie, from eatabullet.com?  I'm sorry?  Oh, Norton.  Norton's plugging his own website like the whore he is. 
[01:31:30]  He's such a plug whore.  Wait, someone else has a question now, Anthony.  Let me, uh...  Yeah?  Hold on a second here.  Let me do this, then go over here.  And then if I go over here...  You have a digital.  Uh, Adam, what's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to know, if it doesn't work down below,  can you use that stuff for Afro-Sheen later on?  Oh, stop it.  Afro-Sheen.  Remember Afro-Sheen?  Because I used to watch Soul Train, and that was one of the sponsors.  Thank God black folk figured out a better way to do stuff with their hair 
[01:32:00]  than that Afro-Sheen.  And Jerry Curl.  Remember the oil slick that would leave?  Yep.  Jiminy Cricket.  Chunk?  Well, no, you can't use it for Afro-Sheen.  No.  Mm.  I bet Jackie's completely shaved, right?  Yeah, right?  Uh-huh, that's what I'm talking about.  Mm.  Mm.  Man, you have the hottest voice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I am dying to be in studio with you, Anthony. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, I bet.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm, you know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're shaved down there.  It looks like Lou Gossett, Jr., right?  I bet you.  It looks like Lou Gossett, Jr. with a hatchet to the head with a black eye.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  I'll show you some mayonnaise.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:33:00]  Well, see, the wonderful thing about it is that, you know, women who don't even have a problem  orgasming, having orgasms.  Or an orgasm.  They can use the cream because it has a more of a major impact on their orgasmic experience.  So, you know.  There's no color on it, though.  It doesn't matter if you're light or dark-skinned, right?  No.  It's clear.  It's not going to look goofy down there, right?  And it's all natural.  Put it on.  Look like a beaver with rabies.  It's not all foamy or nothing. 
[01:33:30]  But when I send you guys the videos, you're going to watch them and tell me the difference,  right?  Yeah, we'll get you back on the phone and we'll give you...  Are you in the videos, Jackie?  Yes, I am.  You are?  Naked?  Sold.  Are you naked or are you just sitting there explaining what's going on?  Tell me Jackie Fine is naked in these videos.  Jackie Fine is naked in these videos.  Are you kidding?  You told me to tell you that Jackie Fine is naked.  You'd be a tease, baby. 
[01:34:00]  You're there just with the pointer.  No pointer.  She's hot sitting there with clothes on and Esterole is demonstrating.  I don't think Jackie needs her cream today.  Yeah.  I'm Big Dick Black.  Yeah.  Okie dokie.  Any more callers?  Well, we're protecting you today, Jackie.  Yeah, we're kind of feeling it.  Because you're Jackie.  I'm kind of feeling it with you.  Oh, so you're going to be nicer this time.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  I want to be with you.  We don't want to be predictable.  Yeah, exactly.  Just when you think the people have us figured out.  We turn it around.  We flip it.  What would you rather hear a guy say to you?  I love you.  I want to make love to you.  Or I take care of my kids.  Or I take care of my kids.  Rhetorical question.  Never mind. 
[01:35:00]  All right there, Miss Jackie Fine.  Yeah.  You know, my birthday is the day before Valentine's.  Ooh.  Ooh.  How old are you going to be on your birthday?  I will never tell.  Ooh, no, huh?  Let me take a look at her picture.  I can't.  The website's being pounded.  I can't even get on it.  Jackie Fine.  She's Jackie.  Can I guess your age when you come in here?  Sure.  Uh-oh.  You know how Opie guesses girls' ages?  How?  He's got to look at their taint.  You know what the taint is, right?  Yes, they do.  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  I'm five for five, Jackie Fine.  Five for five.  What do you think?  Maybe I won't let you guess my age.  He got to gaze into the forbidden zone.  You know what I'm saying?  So has that worked for you, Opie?  Yeah.  Every time.  Five times.  Five for five.  He's five for five, guessing girls' ages.  Oh, my goodness.  Just by looking at the taint.  Man.  Yeah, Jackie.  He's got skills, huh?  He got the skills, man.  Yeah, kid.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  My lady, love.  You know, it's amazing that you guys get paid to do this.  Yeah.  Don't tell anyone.  This week.  They're on to us in Washington.  I hope the other cities aren't on to us.  They're on to us.  Yeah.  Well, let's hear it for Jackie Fine.  She's...  Jackie!  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Good job, Jackie Fine.  Thank you.  Come see us soon and send those videos, all right?  I will.  I'll send them out to you today.  All right.  There she goes.  Jackie Fine. 
[01:36:30]  Bye, Jackie.  Bye.  Bye-bye, Jackie.  Bye-bye.  Yeah.  Sounding all hot.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I bet you're sweet like Mrs. Butterworth.  Right?  I bet you.  Pour you out.  I'll pour you out.  I like pouring out Mrs. Butterworth.  Get her ass up in the air.  Pouring that syrup out.  I like my one's syrup.  See that nice, calmly brown ass just turn clear? 
[01:37:00]  As you're pouring out the syrup.  The syrup.  The syrup.  Oh.  Yeah.  And with that, we'll be back right in.  Yeah.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  I know you want what's on my mind.  I know you like what's on my mind.  I know it's you on this side. 
[01:37:30]  I know you know, you know, you know.  Here I come, girl.  Here I come, girl.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Boston.  Boston.  Just tuning in.  We got great news from Boston.  We did real well in the ratings up there in Boston.  We're more gooder this time around.  I want to thank everyone up there.  More gooder.  For supporting the show. 
[01:38:00]  Rich Voss is in the studio.  Voss, what's up, man?  What's up?  He looks like a proud papa.  I'm not a proud papa.  He's introducing Patrice to Aunt Nye and our listeners.  Patrice is a really funny guy.  I met Patrice a few times there at Caroline's.  Probably one of the funniest comics out there.  He's a creep as a human.  Is he funnier than you?  Yes.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody.  Ask anybody who hasn't seen me and seen Voss. 
[01:38:30]  They know I'm funny.  I like when Voss is plowing through the same old crap.  The same old crap.  It's awful, isn't it?  He won't write.  Lenny Bruce got more new jokes.  And he sells a CD with the same material that he said that Voss won't.  Even his improvs is.  Voss improvs yesterday's stuff.  I came up with a couple new bits. 
[01:39:00]  Go ahead.  Say one.  Give us one of your new bits.  I don't know.  Let me think about, oh, here's a new one who really gets on my nerves.  Jared from Subway.  I hope he gains all his weight back.  In the text, when I'm doing it on stage, he lost 300 pounds eating subs.  I go, what was he eating before that?  Now, can you tell that he's making this?  He wrote this down.  I don't want to stop people from eating.  Rich Voss has made that up yesterday. 
[01:39:30]  He wrote it down.  He's trying it here.  No, I'm not.  What he's going to end up doing is.  Basically, hey, everybody.  Wants to go white.  If.  Walsh.  Walsh.  It's a new job.  Wants to go black.  You never go back home.  Walsh.  Oh.  Walsh is new.  It's a new job.  Buy my CD. 
[01:40:00]  Listen.  You're doing it.  My commercial.  My commercial.  Is Jared even doing those commercials anymore?  Yeah, they show up.  I haven't seen them.  Listen, Ridge Voss always comes up with new stuff all the time.  Hey, now, Mary, did you see me the other night perform?  Oh, they set her up.  Yeah?  You were wonderful.  Well, how funny was that?  You were very funny, and he got me dinner, too.  Oh.  See that?  He didn't pay for it, but he got it for me.  Yeah, I hooked you up, right?  Yes.  With a salad? 
[01:40:30]  Yes, you did.  All right, we're done with you.  What do you think of our new furniture outside the studio?  That's nice.  We're jazzing up the place.  What's that, the vinyl or whatever sort of spoo slides off it?  What is that crap?  I don't know.  It's like the furniture that they brought in.  It looks like Greg Brady's attic bedroom now.  Don't you feel like you're on the real world set or something?  No, I wouldn't put that in a summer beach house.  It's really ugly.  It really is.  I like the old stained stuff that was in here, because you know,  you know, at least when I talk, I'm going to slobber, and I'm not going to feel guilty. 
[01:41:00]  That stuff is horrible.  Who picked it out?  Patrice is just shaking his head out.  Patrice is like, you're saying nothing.  What?  I'm just talking.  If you see these guys down at Caroline's, Voss will be up there.  He'll be doing his act.  And Patrice is sitting by the kitchen door, kind of pretty far away, just mocking Voss the whole time.  It's awful.  No, he's sitting by the kitchen door waiting for food.  I'm fat, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm a fat joke.  You're fat.  People can't see you on the radio, Voss, but I'm a fat guy. 
[01:41:30]  You are a buffet molester.  You're not fat.  Jesus Christ.  You're fat.  Stop insulting me.  Will you get it?  It's the year 2006, Rich.  His jokes are old.  His car is old.  Did you?  Yeah, I heard about this car.  I drove in his car.  He's making payments on an 89 machine.  Wait, but here's the thing.  You're making payments on an 89 machine.  He's got the janitors, like the rich janitor, bins. 
[01:42:00]  It's not even like, it's the bins they make for people that just, but that's Voss.  You ever see him?  Voss, his shirt's dirty.  It's DKNY.  Voss, but it's filthy.  I can't even fight that.  But it's DKNY.  Voss, this car stinks.  It's 1982.  You're playing some Mercedes.  It's your Mercedes. 
[01:42:30]  And you're paying for this?  You're making payments?  Did he tell you he's making payments?  Wait, wait.  Did I tell you what the number was?  Did I tell you what the number was?  No, it was a 190E.  It's a 190E.  Look, it's a clean looking Mercedes.  It's a 190E.  Nobody has a 190E.  I never even heard of that.  You're a big black man.  You're driving a Cadillac.  I'm supposed to.  You're a Jew.  You're driving a Mercedes.  That's only because you're going to get it.  That's only because you're going to get it.  That's only because you're going to get it. 
[01:43:00]  You're driving a Nazi car, not even a good one.  You're driving a bad Nazi car.  You suck.  Oh, man.  This is what he thought.  This is what he thought when he came up here.  Just real quick.  I'm sorry.  I don't want to hog this.  No, hell no.  This is what he thought.  He says, he's thinking, I'm just.  Enough with a slobber.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Some people distinguish.  He's talking about you instead of just talking.  This is what he thought.  He thought, hey, I'm.  Because him and Norton, for some reason, they think they're good fellas now. 
[01:43:30]  For some reason.  They want to pay for meals now.  They point at you when they talk.  Hey, hey.  Everybody's Italian, even at Chinese restaurants.  Hey, oh, hey there.  Hiya.  And this is what he thought.  He thinks he's a made man.  He's going to bring me up to the Opie and Anthony show and make a complete jackass out of me.  Because he's a regular guest.  He's going to stop all that, everybody.  Hey, Patricia, this is a pinball machine that's broke.  Hey, secretaries.  Hey, everybody.  Like he's bringing me through the back entrance. 
[01:44:00]  And the good fella's like.  He thinks he's Ray Liotta now.  He sucks.  He's using you just to get air time.  You know that, right?  That's what he does right there.  We would never have him up.  Did he tell you he is a regular guest?  The regular guest, though, that everyone goofs on.  He stinks.  This is what he thought.  He said, okay, I'm going to bring on some new guy.  But you didn't realize they can't see fat over the radio.  But then you hear.  Voss, you notice how you were whisked right into the studio as soon as you got here? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  I have to get it back.  Think about it.  Oh, okay.  Voss killed when he has something to goof on in this studio.  No, listen.  I never fail for you guys.  We're all team players.  I didn't bring up here thinking, hey, I'm going to crack on you.  I don't care about you.  No, I didn't.  What am I going to say possibly about you?  No.  You absolutely did, Voss.  No, I don't like how you try to use me like I'm the new kid at Reese's show.  No.  Not at all.  They call me and say, you know, whatever.  We've been trying to get you on the show for a while, Patrice.  That is the truth.  Listen, if your phone was turned on and they could have called you, then you would have 
[01:45:00]  known that.  There you go.  Black people's phones ain't turned on.  No, yours are.  Yours isn't, okay?  See, and whenever I come back to you, you're going to be on the whole black people thing.  You know?  It's you.  You.  It has nothing to do with black people.  Do you like his black humor there, Patrice?  It's, I mean, yeah.  The wallet joke and the fried chicken, the coochie fried.  Every black comic on earth talks about white people.  Not really.  I don't.  Who?  Yes, you do.  No, no.  You don't talk about white people?  No. 
[01:45:30]  No?  Say one.  I could say about ten of them.  Say one.  When I'm walking down the street, some white lady's walking at me and I'm thinking, you know.  That's reflective on me.  You're talking about white people.  On what I think.  I'm not saying white people's phones work, black people's don't.  Go on, Debbie Wise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you saying?  Okay.  White people.  White people.  Well, no.  You don't do that, Debbie.  White people talk like, oh, hey, hey.  Well, no.  White ladies fall at the monster movie.  That's what I do.  No, you don't do that.  Are you a liar?  You don't do that like white people are crazy, white people pay taxes. 
[01:46:00]  I said I get nervous.  White people support their kids.  You don't do that kind of stuff.  No.  You do like.  I don't remember what I do because I'm moving on to new material.  They get up early for what?  White people, they crazy.  You don't do that kind of stuff.  White people, they crazy.  They see their kids once or twice a year.  No.  See, you do the regular stuff about white people.  White people crazy.  That's not me.  They got bank accounts.  Now he's making up stuff.  White people crazy.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's not on his CD.  They like girls with small asses.  All that stuff is not on his CD. 
[01:46:30]  Stop using me as a black guinea pig.  I don't like that.  I'm not.  I'm just saying.  You talk about white people.  Voss, say one of my jokes.  I try not to remember your act.  Say one of my jokes.  Listen, you do the one about if a white lady gets killed, you don't want to be blamed for it.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  That's white.  That's very funny.  It is funny.  It's very funny.  Yes.  How about if a lady gets killed, you don't want to be blamed for it?  Why has it got to be a white lady? 
[01:47:00]  Of course, if a white lady is killed in real life, you're going to look at black people.  It's funny when I say white lady, Voss.  Yes, but it's funny when I say black people.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  They feel bad for you, Rich.  No.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Wait.  Wait.  When we're doing...  Okay.  Here's the deal.  22 years in the business.  Listen to me.  A room full of all black...  A room full of all black comics.  Yeah.  I mean, all black audience.  Yeah.  Right?  You're on stage, Armand.  Who's going to do better?  Me.  Yeah?  Let's get your old Apollo tape. 
[01:47:30]  Let's get your Apollo tape.  I got booed once.  You got booed 17 times, and you think black people love you.  No.  They hate you, like white people, like Jews.  No one likes you.  What happened at the Apollo?  I got booed right off.  How did that happen?  You got booed at the Apollo?  I came out there nice and arrogant.  You know what?  I didn't come out there.  What's up?  What's up?  I went up there.  Yo.  Yeah, Apollo.  I expected the same reaction I'd get at Caroline's.  Nothing.  You know what you got to come out with?  For the Apollo, you come out in an Asian guy mask, and they will love you. 
[01:48:00]  I have seen, I've watched every goddamn episode of Showtime at the Apollo, and they love,  when the Asian, like, they could do 80s breakdancing.  They could do 80s breakdancing.  They got like this.  And we got this Japanese troupe over there.  They don't speak a word of English.  They go, oh.  And the music starts.  The whole crowd goes, wah!  They go crazy.  And if they sing gospel, that's easy.  Oh, yeah.  A Chinese guy singing gospel on the Apollo.  Oh, yeah.  Forget it.  He's 20 weeks in a row.  He's winning.  I got booed right off. 
[01:48:30]  Really?  Too arrogant, you think?  Yeah, I came out nice and like I was funny.  Yeah.  I got a big, fat lesson.  They're not going to show it, though, because I curse.  I made sure.  Do you got it?  Do you got it?  Do you got it?  Do you got it?  Do you got it?  Do you got it?  Do you got it?  Do you got it?  Do you got it?  Show this?  That's smart.  Yeah, they're going to show it.  Hey, Elisa from Cleveland has a problem today.  Elisa, what's up?  Oh, bummer.  It says, on her period but wants sex, even just oral, boyfriend won't what to do, what  to do.  Elisa, we lose you? 
[01:49:00]  No.  So, now, you're having your time, is that okay, and your boyfriend doesn't touch you  when you're doing this?  Yeah, I don't know what his time is.  He doesn't want to get freaky or anything.  You know, it's like, I'm on my rag, and I've been on my rag for months.  See, I started taking my birth control.  Maybe it's the way you put it.  No.  Okay, look.  Well, hey.  I'm on my rag for months.  Maybe you're a kid.  Hey, bag, same thing.  And see, I haven't had any sex because he doesn't want to do anything, and it's pissing me off.  He doesn't want to do anything.  And I'm a freak like that, and I like to...  So, he's not into the crime scene sex, right? 
[01:49:30]  Crime scene sex is perfectly acceptable.  Just do it on...  You guys into the crime scene sex?  Darker sheets.  No, no.  You don't do that?  No?  I don't mind committing a crime to get sex, but I'm not into the crime.  You won't...  I make my girl sleep on the floor.  She's on a period.  Really?  What?  I don't even touch her.  Nasty.  Stinking.  Pretty ugly.  Now it's bleeding.  You should be willing to touch her no matter what.  That's your girl.  Wow.  She only bleeds for four days on the floor. 
[01:50:00]  Okay, I'm not asking him to do something every night.  A month of bleeding from that mess.  I don't even know if that made the error.  That's hilarious.  I don't know.  God damn.  Yeah, I don't...  You know something?  I got no problem.  The guy should have...  He should dive right in there.  Yeah, there's no gray area with that one, man.  You should grow it.  You're either into it or not.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  What should I say to him?  Say F me or I'll find someone that will.  I don't get him, Colin.  It's not blood.  I can't do that.  I've been with this guy for like two years.  It's all kinds of stuff.  Yeah, it's eggs and... 
[01:50:30]  It's like a puree.  And it's cleansing.  If he was just bleeding like it was a wound, it would be different.  Yeah, but I'm saying, see, and I'm almost off and it's not even all that bad anymore.  So late a day or two.  It's like it's almost done and he still won't do anything.  It's been like two weeks since he's touched me and it's like...  Maybe he just doesn't want to have sex with you.  What do you look like?  Hey, hey, what's that language?  What's that language?  What do you look like?  What do I look like?  Yeah, I just needed some...  Long blonde hair.  Yeah, how's that?  Yeah. 
[01:51:00]  What else do you want to know?  On a one to ten, what are you?  Huh?  On a one to ten scale, what are you?  And you got to be an eight.  I'm a personal opinion.  No, from the guy down the block.  Yeah, personal opinion.  I'll give myself an eight.  I'll be in Cleveland next week.  Well, if it's, like Patrice said, if it looks like a regular wound blood,  if it's like, what, like ragu marinara, you don't want to, no, nothing even near there.  If it was that bad, I wouldn't ask him to do anything.  Looks like cacciatore.  Chunks of peppers and onions. 
[01:51:30]  All that fun stuff also.  Sure.  Sure.  Looks like salsa.  Aww.  Aww.  Aww.  Well, maybe he's got a point now that I think about it.  All right, Elizabeth, I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah, we can't help you today.  You're either into it or not.  All right, thanks anyway, you guys.  All right.  Big Al, you no-get period for a month.  She's dying.  She's making a quick diagnosis.  She's dying. 
[01:52:00]  She's dying.  I don't know.  Jimmy, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yeah, hey, boss.  What's up?  And the words from Jim Norton, you stink.  Thank you.  All right, thanks.  We'll be back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Hey, look who I'm looking here. 
[01:52:30]  Who just walked into the studio.  We got Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  We would have been here earlier since Fendry Music Steve stopped us down the hall.  Pablo gets to walk right in.  We get stopped.  Look at the callback.  I love it.  Well, he's had a security there, Fezzy.  Ron, what were you doing all day that no one could contact you? 
[01:53:00]  We're taking care of stuff, buddy.  We're taking care of stuff.  Big news.  Big news is coming up.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Big news.  Are you going to become a sports guy?  Is that the news?  That's like hearing you just got cancer.  That's going to be the new promo, I hear.  That's like saying, is it malignant?  That's what they say.  Is it malignant?  Well, it is the same as saying you've got three months.  Right. 
[01:53:30]  The same thing.  Put your affairs in order.  Morning.  You're a sports guy.  Sports guy.  Although, Fez is now Pharrell Fez, whatever the hell that means.  Is that it?  I don't know why.  We like Scott Pharrell.  We love whatever works for you.  I haven't met him yet.  We like this sports guy combo.  There's a combo now?  Yeah.  There's always a combo.  There's always a combo.  You're always just changing the numbers a little bit.  I like the Scotty Pharrell in the same way I like to watch a small child play with a loaded gun.  Because, you know, someday he's just going to kill himself with himself.  The best advice.  Yeah, right. 
[01:54:00]  And you enjoy that.  Right.  It's fun to watch.  If you like him, the best advice is never take a vacation, Scott.  Yeah.  You know, Blaine's going, you know, I don't really need any time off.  I'm fine.  How surprised was Blaine?  He took two weeks off for Christmas and had a job when he came back.  Right.  Blaine was in your Christmas morning looking around.  Everything okay?  Oh, God.  Is it cool?  So, Ron?  All right, let me get this straight.  You get a beautiful collector's item from Aldous.  He collects stuff like this.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:54:30]  I got a Robotron.  That thing is, but my Robotron's worth $2,000.  I love Robotron.  Now, this, when I walked in there, it's like Captain Fantastic at Elton John's.  Right.  Only $1,000 made.  Well, we're here in $5,700.  Oh, is that right?  But who's counting?  And I just saw on eBay there's one of those available in better condition for that $570.  Oh, I heard $3,000.  What happened to the $3,000?  How are you talking it up?  It's like the engagement ring all of a sudden turns out to be a cubic zirconia.  And a certificate proving that it's fake. 
[01:55:00]  Well, no matter what we do, I say we sell it if you don't like it.  We're all for $1,200.  Ain't about the money.  $1,200.  It's not about the money.  Why don't we do this?  Then all the proceeds go to a half ounce of Coke that we can relax for.  It's not a problem.  You're going to be a call, it's going to be okay, okay?  Let me tell you something.  It's going to be great, okay?  Tom O. Escobar.  Fantastic.  Tom O. Escobar.  That's when radio was great, when you could just sell one of those guitars off the air.  That's some Coke.  Listen, I'm serious.  Just take it, and then I'll get back to you with the rest of the money. 
[01:55:30]  That's Clapton's guitar!  That's Clapton's!  You've got to write a book, too.  Oh, my God.  Well, no, it's not about the money.  It's about breaking his heart.  See, this is the thing.  This is what it's all about.  Al Dukes is, I've said this, in love with Opie.  Let's not candy coat this.  He's in love with the man.  Right.  And it's a little disturbing.  No, it's true, though.  It is!  He pictures Opie up on top of that pinball machine like it was Jodie Foster. 
[01:56:00]  Jodie Foster in The Accused.  Oh, awful.  What?  There we are.  Now we sit and...  Well, it's yours to do whatever you want with.  That's the way I see it.  Well, I'm sure he'll replace it with something much more lavish if you destroy this one.  Ron Corleone, I'm asking you...  If you're going to do these things...  No, it came to me.  There was a kid who brought in a pinball machine.  When it was smashed, I didn't go looking. 
[01:56:30]  I didn't ask any questions.  Friends, because this is the business we've chose.  No, you've got to do what you've got to do, Opie.  I'm just showing respect to that family.  That is respect.  That's total respect.  I don't want to smash the machine.  You're going to keep bringing me back in.  Ron Corleone.  It's up to you.  I mean, do you think you'll feel better smashing a collectible pinball machine?  He always feels better when he smashes people's gifts.  I'm just afraid we're not going to get anything ever again.  Because every time...  All right, hold on.  Remember Anthony Limo guy brought in the Jets gumball machine? 
[01:57:00]  Right.  Nice.  Smash.  It was a stupid bobbly head.  Stalk and Patty, everything she brings in.  Smash.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Remember when Rascals gave us the Louis XIII scotch?  The cognac.  Cognac or whatever?  Yeah.  Nice.  Didn't smash that?  No.  I love when, like, Caroline's and people bring the really expensive champagne by.  Nice.  It's got to be expensive.  Yeah, right.  Well, the cheap stuff.  Come on.  We all know.  And then we get some bottles of wine from time to time. 
[01:57:30]  Know what I got today that I'm fully enjoying and will not smash?  What?  A Kurt Cobain poster from the fine folks down there in Philly at WYSP.  The Kurt and Corby.  Frame the rate of a movie poster.  Go up on our wall.  Nice.  So I don't break everything.  Isn't it an after poster?  With me laying there on the ground?  With just the feet?  You got the feet showing?  You know you're going to get the calls now.  Dude, shut up about Kurt.  You know, he was a genius, man.  Dick.  I just don't like...  You wish you had the talent he had in his... 
[01:58:00]  I just don't like kiss asses.  He's kissing ass.  He's just ridiculous.  I know in his heart he thought that you were just going to say,  Okay, Al.  Right.  This was unbelievable.  This is what I said.  Man, you should hang.  Right.  He thought this was going to turn into,  Al, man, you know, we had our thing.  Or maybe even that Opie would go,  Ah, it's been a bit, you know, I just wanted to go.  But I really want you to know,  I appreciate the pinball machine.  Everything's great.  Now open mouth kiss me.  Oh, we're...  You know?  That's how he feels.  I can tell. 
[01:58:30]  Well, the guy is attracted to you.  Right.  The guy talks in terms of relationships.  You use that word?  The relationship with Opie.  I know.  He wants to hang out.  They'll laugh about this over beers when they're hanging.  I mean, what?  He has your girlfriend about you?  Like, what kind of things do you like to do?  What he's like off the air?  Well, that really put it over the top when he's asking my girlfriend,  Well, how is he, like, off the air?  Yeah.  See, I think the strategy is...  It's not your effing business.  He buys you a big enough gift that he has to help you move it to home. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, is that it?  That he gets to see your house.  I think late at night he's looking out his window like Fiebel,  just wondering what the hell you're up to.  He's glancing.  Somewhere out there.  He's just gazing towards Long Island.  What's your high score?  No, he's doing something.  That's how he feels about you, though.  Is he all uncomfortable in the back office?  Yeah.  Oh, we're reenacting the mailroom thing.  Have to.  Yeah.  The Caramel or Mailroom.  Keep him in the mailroom until Opie passes by him. 
[01:59:30]  That really happened for about six months around here.  I got no problem with that.  It was the only way to separate certain radio hosts from each other.  What are we doing?  Make him say goodbye to his machine.  Oh, God.  Make him say goodbye to it.  Make him kiss Mick Jagger goodbye.  Make him say goodbye, dude.  On the unit.  Make him say I'm going to miss you to Mick Jagger.  Rick, you got a mic?  Go outside the studio.  He's not coming in the studio.  Grab him and make him come down.  Where did he get the pinball from?  Because I don't want that guy to suffer. 
[02:00:00]  Classic Pinball Corporation.  Oh, they're great, by the way.  Yeah.  Classic Pinball Corporation.  They're incorporated now, you know.  ClassicPinball.com.  You've got to check this stuff out.  ClassicPinball.com.  I think they were going to give us the Space Invaders, but I don't see that happening.  Oh, see, now you've got my soft spot.  They're going to be great.  We'll bring it down.  What time do you want to take a dump on it?  Thank you very much.  ClassicPinball.com.  9-7-3-3-4-5-3-9-4-4. 
[02:00:30]  That's worth at least $1,000 on our show.  So they can't be picked up.  Might be mad.  Go get Al.  No, don't bring him in here.  Not in here.  Let him stand outside.  It's really uncomfortable.  It's embarrassing.  Just make him stand in the corner over there, like in the Blair Witch Project.  He has to stand in the corner as Opie kills the machine.  With his back to the pinball machine.  With his back to the machine.  So he just hears the horrible sounds of it.  All right.  Have him lay down, and he doesn't know whether the pinball machine is going to get hit or  him. 
[02:01:00]  Don't give Opie that choice.  We'll be playing pinball after it's all done.  And he'll finally get your new producer.  If you can kneecap him, then don't break the machine.  Oh, a little hobbling.  So what are we doing?  Oh, is this Al Dukes?  Yes, it is.  Where are you?  I'm in one of the production rooms.  Oh.  Why don't you...  Are you staring at us right now?  Are you watching Opie?  No, I'm in a closed office.  I'm watching you through the glass, Opie.  I don't know who's office.  I know who you are. 
[02:01:30]  Team.  Yeah.  You're holding the phone with one hand, and what are you doing with the other as you gaze  at the man you love?  No, I'm not attracted to Opie.  Oh, really?  No.  You sure know how to show it.  It was just...  I brought a nice gesture.  Do you understand that's a nice gesture reserved for couples, maybe, that have been in love?  Maybe a guy is a collector of these things, and his wife scrapes up money for years  to afford something like this, and you just get it for Opie for what?  Or as a gesture to say, hey... 
[02:02:00]  A gesture gift...  Let's make love.  ...is a bottle.  A bottle of maybe Captain Morgan rum.  Here's a good gesture.  It's like, here, it mixes well with Coke.  Here you go.  Both kinds.  But a good gesture...  Guys don't buy other guys' stuff.  Especially stuff like that.  Did this fantasy of yours end with Opie taking a baseball bat to the present?  Did this come into your equation anywhere?  No, I don't have any fantasies about Opie.  I was just making a nice gesture, just, hey, whatever... 
[02:02:30]  To make your relationship better?  To make your relationship with him better?  A work relationship.  I'll say this, but first he asked me if Opie skied.  He wanted to get him skis.  Now, that's strange.  Were you talking about skis?  Are you...  No, he goes, does he Opie skied?  I go, I don't know.  You know how personal...  Because I like to get him skis...  He wanted to get you any sort of athletic wear.  Yeah, some kind of vest he wanted to get you.  Skis are such a personal item.  Really is.  Go to Aspen and have a little romantic ski party.  Yeah, you want to go to Aspen with him? 
[02:03:00]  To the ski party.  Aspen.  Aspen.  Aspen.  I said, I said, it's...  Kevin.  Yeah, I'm here.  From ClassicPinball.com.  That's me.  Hi, Kevin.  Hi.  Hey, Al, look who's on the phone.  Hey, Kevin.  Hey, Al, how you doing?  It's your dealer.  What are they going to do?  Well, it's, uh, it's, uh, you know, this is...  Looking grim.  Looking grim, huh?  Do you have repairs over there?  Want to make out?  We do extensive repairs.  Yeah, you might have to.  Extensive.  I think we should just save the pieces, maybe, and sell them off, you know, one piece of glass at a time. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's getting up.  Oh, no.  Oh, jeez.  No.  He's getting up.  He's getting up.  He's getting up.  Oh, no.  He's getting up.  He's getting up.  Now, that thing's worth a lot of money, right?  It is.  Oh, Fee.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Tell the answer to run.  Everyone's kind of running away from the area.  What a difference a day makes.  Okay, now, oh, my God.  Everybody was happy yesterday.  Now. 
[02:04:00]  Oh, God.  All right, hold on here.  Did you guys restore that, uh, that pinball machine?  Was it wrecked when you...  Oh, boy.  It was pretty trash.  Nothing worked.  Kik used to do rails off the top of it.  Are the decals the same as the originals?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  All right.  He's got the sledgehammer.  Oh, my God.  Hey, all I got to tell you is, uh, maybe someone should shield their friggin' eyes.  I predict Opie cutting his wrist off. 
[02:04:30]  I don't think he's going to do it.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Look, look, man.  It is...  Dude, it's a classic.  Don't.  Oh, my God.  It almost fell off the chair.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's like a movie from Chris Dean.  No, no, no, he's got it.  Oh, no, no.  He's got the big Gallagher mallet.  It took, like, a year to find that thing.  Watch this.  Where's Al?  Make Al watch.  Wait a minute.  They're pulling him out.  Hey, Al, have you ever seen Rambo First Blood, too? 
[02:05:00]  He got you this thing out of the goodness of his heart.  This is just going to be like that scene in Rocky 3 where Pauly throws the bottle right  through the pinball machine.  Oh, look at his face.  Oh, no.  I mean, this is what you want to do.  There's Al.  Hey, Al.  Hey, Opia, I dare you to smash it.  It's so sad.  There's your voice.  It's so sad.  With the mallet.  I dare you.  This is so cool.  I mean, I just got it as a gesture.  Hey, Al, we accept Visa, MasterCard.  Business relationship thing.  Oh, boy.  There's the government.  Oh, no. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, my God.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  It's gone.  Oh, no, no.  They're killing me, man.  Look out.  Did you hear that?  There's pinball collectors throwing themselves out windows.  Keith Moon lives.  Keith Moon lives.  Oh, my God.  Holy Jesus. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, that's copyrighted material.  There is one heartbroken little Nancy boy out there.  Dude, he completely didn't think you were going to do that.  He totally did not believe you were really going to do that.  That's what I think of your kid, and that's what I think of you.  Oh, God.  There is a mess out there.  Make him clean it up.  It looks like a car wreck.  Make him clean it up.  You can't even tell what it was.  Oh, no. 
[02:06:30]  No.  It looks like James Dean's car.  Save the pieces.  He said save the pieces.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  There are no pieces left.  Did they hit the flipper?  Then hit Mick Jagger right in the groin, and he disappears.  Now, do you have a kiss machine?  Maybe you'd like kiss.  Oh, God.  No kiss.  No kiss.  You want a kiss machine?  No.  No.  Don't send anything.  Why don't you just hit it with a hammer over there?  Probably a better idea.  Yeah.  Just break it there.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe the sound. 
[02:07:00]  I'm going to look at it.  That's what I think.  All right.  Well, um.  The warranty just expired.  I can't believe you guys did that.  I might do it.  It was fun.  I want to get a girl and flashback.  Uh-oh.  What's happening now?  Classicpinball.com.  Thank you, Kevin.  All right.  We'll be back in just a bit.  O.P.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  What do you got over there, Anthony? 
[02:07:30]  I'm just thinking about it.  So, you know something?  How many quick lines do we throw out here on a daily basis?  Hundreds.  And I blurt something out.  It doesn't quite go over with the audience.  And they just pound me.  And it's just fun because most of your stuff hits the mark. 
[02:08:00]  So, when you don't hit the mark, it's kind of fun to watch a squirm.  Who's checking in?  Show me crickets.  Captain Cranky-Ass from Queens.  Today, I learned Anthony can bomb just as bad as Spaz.  Oh, come on.  Cricket.  Hey, Ant.  I got it.  Yeah, thank you.  I guess when you're in the market for tampons, you watch the commercials, Ant.  We all changed the channel.  See, I couldn't even defend myself.  White shorts.  Hey, Ant.  You hear the bomb dropping? 
[02:08:30]  Oh, wait, Ant.  I got to play something here.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You could bike, swim, and wear white shorts, right?  White shorts?  Am I missing some?  Oh, come on.  You got to get that one.  Anybody out there would get that one.  You could bike, swim, and wear white shorts.  White shorts?  Yeah.  It's a reference to maybe a tampon commercial. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, come on.  No one got it.  I'm sure the audience did.  Okay.  Terrific.  Shout it out, Ant.  Shout it out.  Oh, my God.  You trip up once, and that's it, huh?  It's over, Johnny.  When did you start doing this show?  Figure it out.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, my God.  You should have shouted out the joke when it didn't work the first time. 
[02:09:30]  As the Joe says, South Orange, hey, Anthony, I hear if the joke doesn't work the first time,  you should yell it out the next time.  Is this thing on?  Ping pong, anyone?  Look at this.  I'm being totally hammered.  No, you're not, Ant.  Let's go to the phones.  Everyone's very, very polite here.  Hey, Ant, is that a train?  Our listeners are very understanding.  Yeah.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, I just want to say, all of a sudden, Spaz sounds like Milton Berle compared to that  Anthony. 
[02:10:00]  What the hell are you thinking about?  All of a sudden, I want to go see Jackie at Joe, man.  Brilliant.  Are you ready to laugh?  I said, are you?  Tom from Bay Ridge, maybe Wendy took half of Anthony's sense of humor.  Hey, Ant, does your girlfriend even need tampons yet?  Very funny.  The listeners, I'll be very funny.  Play Pac-Man sound here. 
[02:10:30]  When do we start Anthony's week in review?  I got a brutal email about you today.  I meant to bring it up.  What?  They want to make sure that your girlfriend is sleeping on her back because they don't  want her to get SIDS.  Would that be sudden infant death syndrome, Obey?  Yes, it would be.  Very funny. 
[02:11:00]  No, I make sure.  The crap you guys throw at us on a daily basis, man.  But I make sure I crank the little mobile up over the crib and it goes around and jackass.  Wow, you're just getting pounded.  I know.  The only thing that went over anyone's head was the Enola Gay over Anthony's head on  that joke.  White shorts.  Everyone feeling good about themselves because you crack them up every day.  Boy, you want to slip up and they don't let you sleep. 
[02:11:30]  Just like us, they'll pound something into the ground.  Over, Johnny.  If you let me, Anthony.  John from Staten Island.  If Ant drops a bomb in the middle of the woods, does it make a sound?  Is Anthony a special guest on Mason and Kalinsky?  Jason from Riverheads.  Please, guys, serious comments for Anthony only.  Hey, Anthony, great line. 
[02:12:00]  I can't wait to see it on the AFI 100 Funniest Lines.  You've been hanging around Spaz too long.  Dice checking in from over here.  You want to open for me at the comedy toilet?  Bill from Jersey.  Tonight a privilege.  One night only.  From the O&A show.  Anthony.  Even the cockroaches didn't survive that bomb.  Holy merc.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you, people.  I understand now. 
[02:12:30]  They're getting violent on the phones now.  Ed.  Yeah.  What's up?  Nothing.  What are you guys doing?  I'm talking to you.  Hey.  That was one of the worst jokes I've ever heard of mine.  What are you doing listening to a tampon commercial and knowing the lines from it?  What?  I watch a lot of TV and I don't always turn the commercials off.  Sometimes there's a hot girl on the tampon commercial.  I'm backpedaling.  I know you are.  Totally.  Just like Sarah Jessica Parker.  It doesn't happen often, so it's kind of fun to watch you squirm it. 
[02:13:00]  It's not working.  All right, Ed.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jason from River Edge.  He's just pounding you, man.  Thank you.  At this point, I don't think he's a fan of you, man.  Thank you, James.  White shorts?  Is that the in color with all the teenagers this summer?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  I'm trying to help you out, Anthony. 
[02:13:30]  The Enola Gay checking in from McDonnell Douglas.  I feel so empty.  Hey, Anthony, do your jokes ever have that not-so-fresh feeling?  Opie may be crueler than Hitler, but Hitler was funnier than Anthony.  I can't allow my pal to get pounded like this.  The show's not even over, and I already learned that Anthony can stink up a room with jokes 
[02:14:00]  that even Spaz threw away.  Come on.  Give me a break here.  It wasn't even a joke.  It was just an off comment.  Let's go to Andrew.  Hey, Andrew, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  What's up, man?  Anthony, next time you do a Paisanos commercial, maybe your girlfriend can come in and talk about  the children's menu.  You're laughing in the hallways, Anthony. 
[02:14:30]  I'm trying to.  Very much.  You know me.  I'm trying to help you out here.  Good child's menu.  I will not allow this to go on, Anthony.  Brenda Vaccaro checking in, Anthony, from the 70s.  Give me my joke back.  It's hard for him to ignore those tampon commercials while he's watching his soap operas.  Shut up.  God, I hate you, man.  Me? 
[02:15:00]  I'm trying to get you out of here.  No, I'm talking to all the listeners.  Yes.  Stay down, Rock.  Just stay down.  Oh, my God.  I can't read this one.  And I promise you will not hate me if I read this one.  It's from a girl, Heather from Fairfield.  Okay.  Hey, Anthony, do you watch the tampon commercials with your girlfriend in preparation for her big  day?  Yeah, that's exactly it.  I tell her all the time, don't be afraid when it happens. 
[02:15:30]  It's part of becoming a woman.  You F and C word.  Hey, Ann, what happened?  Opie's usually the one who always puts his foot in his mouth.  Not you.  That's true.  That's why this is fun.  It happens.  What can I say?  Oh, my God.  Dude, it's just painful on the phone.  I can see.  Let's go to Mark.  Hi, Mark.  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Yeah, is it true that Ann brought his girlfriend in for bringing his daughter to work day? 
[02:16:00]  Ann, I'm sorry.  I thought he saw boobs on the highway.  I see.  Yes.  I don't understand.  That guy got wowed on the turnpike.  Yeah, I know.  They lied just to get through with those hysterical remarks that they're making.  I apologize, Anthony.  Someone wants to know if you're going to be laughing your balls off.  In Poughkeepsie.  Yes.  Opening for the dice, man, with my funny tampon jokes.  Does your girlfriend wear tampons or diapers?  I see. 
[02:16:30]  I see.  I see.  I see.  The humor is, you know, taking the truth and then exaggerating it so much, Opie, that it  just becomes hysterically funny like the listeners are doing diapers.  See, that's so funny.  Jackass.  Jackass.  All right.  We're done with that, right?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you, listeners.  It was fun.  I'm at this just in.  I want to shut them up.  This guy's giving you advice. 
[02:17:00]  Tell them how you traded in your 63 for an 81.  Jesus Christ.  We could take a break if you like, Anthony.  That usually helps things along.  Oh, does it?  Yeah.  Man, you say one thing.  It looks like Jim got wowed on the LIE.  Jim.  Yo, listen.  I got two tickets for Sesame Street Live.  We can't go because my daughter's got a Rotompson taken out.  Maybe Anthony wants them. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, sure.  I'll go.  Oh, wow.  Danny up in Westchester.  He just got wowed.  Danny.  Hello.  Yeah, what's up, Danny?  Yeah, hey.  I just called to find out if Anthony talks as well.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You bunch of.  Dan, was your girlfriend alive during the Bill Buckner incident? 
[02:18:00]  That's Mike from Rockland.  Kenny from Oceanside.  Sarah Jessica Parker was funnier.  Paul.  Oh, this is a good one.  Paul from Lawrence.  I think I heard someone order a gin and tonic.  Hey, Anthony, the yellow one is the sun.  Bob Hope checking in.  Anthony, he's one funny guy.  Uh, Berger from New Rochelle.  Rodney King didn't take a beating this bad.  It was one lousy line.  That's one friggin' thing.  One lousy line in the middle of commercials. 
[02:18:30]  Give me a break here.  All right.  I'm being hammered.  When Anthony's girlfriend accused him of being a pedophile.  Anthony said, that's a mighty big word for a 12-year-old.  Can I go on record as saying, my girlfriend is not 12 years old.  Okay.  Can I at least say that?  Yes, you can, Anthony.  You're a bunch of frickin' jackasses. 
[02:19:00]  Shit.  She just had a birthday.  Uh, Howie from New York.  Shut up.  That's not...  Anthony.  Howie from New York writes, Anthony, turning comedy into tragedy.  That's funny.  All right.  I think you've taken it off the view, Sam, huh?  Anthony, how much are your girlfriend's Girl Scout cookies?  I mean, you know.  I apologize, Anthony.  Uh, Bill from Jersey, Anthony, don't be so hard on yourself.  I got it.  I like to dress up as a woman and play with tampons. 
[02:19:30]  They're running them in here really fast, though, Anthony.  Oh, aren't they?  No, Eric.  Eric writes, Anthony, oh, she's 11?  No.  You could bike, swim, and wear white shorts, right?  Okay.  Wait, do the crickets for me, Anthony.  Thank you.  You've got to abuse yourself, because you're really funny.  She got the machine.  Uh, one more time.  You could bike, swim, and, uh, wear white shorts, right? 
[02:20:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  I'll be here all week.  Try the veal.  You could bike, swim, and, uh, wear white shorts, right?  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:20:30]  1027 WNEW.  Hey, look who's on the phone with us right now.  Buddy Epson! 
[02:21:00]  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, well, doggies to you.  How's my, how's our buddy, buddy?  Hey, uh, uh, usually you pick up the phone and people say to me, what's new?  My, my songs are new.  You're...  I want to talk about my songs.  Oh, yeah.  I hear you have a CD out, buddy.  I got a CD.  I hear you have a, uh, a copy of some of them.  Yes, I, I was actually listening to the one about the, uh, we're all, uh, together on 
[02:21:30]  one spaceship, or, uh, what's that one called, buddy?  We're all riding on the same spaceship.  We're all riding on the same spaceship.  And are you singing?  That's better.  Are you singing?  Yeah, I sing it on the, on the, on the, also, I got a little, a little help from, uh, some  other people.  Right.  And it's quite an exciting, uh, piece.  Have you played it?  Uh, we're going to listen to it right now.  I was listening to some in the office.  Well, why don't I get up here and then let the people hear it?  All right, but, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:22:00]  You don't go anywhere, buddy.  Yeah, hold on.  We got to get just a couple things out of you there, buddy.  Yeah.  It's a new CD out, and you can find it off, uh, buddyepson.com, right?  Yeah.  All right, don't you go anywhere, though, buddy.  We, we want to talk to you.  Okay.  Um.  All right.  Hey, buddy, how old are you now?  How old am I?  Funny you should ask.  Ah, ha, ha.  Yeah, but, when, um, when, uh, I'm sitting on the front porch.  Uh-huh. 
[02:22:30]  Uh-huh.  And, uh, and a pretty girl walks by.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And my pacemaker starts to open the garage door.  Oh, hey!  Look at that one.  Hey, boy.  That's an idea of how old I am.  I like that.  But, anyway, uh, as long as she keeps opening the door, that's fine.  That's right.  That's right.  You still got a lot of spunk there, buddy, don't you?  I'm thinking you're, like, 95, buddy.  Pardon?  I think you're 95 years old, huh?  How old?  95? 
[02:23:00]  Uh, not 95 yet.  No, I don't think so.  I don't keep, uh, I don't keep score.  Yeah.  I just, you know, I live by one action.  Use it or lose it.  Use it or lose it.  We got that one.  We got that one.  Of course.  You got that?  I like that.  We like that from you.  Buddy, can I ask a favor of you?  Oh, no.  Okay.  I, I, uh, of course, your beloved character, uh, Jed Clampett from, uh, the Beverly Hillbillies. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  We all remember it.  Lives on, uh, in syndication on, on, uh, where, where is that being played now?  That Nickelodeon, maybe?  That Nickelodeon.  All of it.  Yeah.  Nickelodeon, yeah.  We love it.  And you, you did the well doggy, uh, back then.  And can we hear a little, uh, Buddy Epson saying, well doggy.  Well, I usually use that for, if I get offline.  Yeah.  When we're all through talking, I'll give you, you know, well doggy.  Well, I, I, I just want to, I just want to hear it all.  One, one, one, one right now? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, because we'll get off another.  Okay, you ready?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Well, doggy.  All right.  Nice.  Hey.  Just like I remember from Buddy Epson.  Very good.  That's not bad at all, Buddy.  Now, Buddy, where are you, this is a CD you got out.  Is this a new CD?  Yeah.  Well, it's, uh, it's on, uh, uh, Buddy Epson's originals.  Now, this is a song that you recorded, uh, a few years back?  Yes, you recorded it and re-recorded it and, and, uh, and smartened it up a little bit so that, 
[02:24:30]  that it, uh, it sounds better.  Oh, I gotcha.  That's, uh, not really.  Available on springboundmusic.com.  Oh, look at you all over the web.  Springbound.com.  On the web.  Or buddyepson.com on the web.  All right.  Or, uh, a phone call for 888-280-7715.  All right, Buddy's doing business.  I like that.  I see, uh, on the front page of buddyepson.com, we see you in a little, uh, Santa hat for Christmas 
[02:25:00]  with a saxophone.  Very, uh, very cute picture there, Buddy.  Hey, Buddy, you, uh, you got a gal in your life?  I, uh, I played the saxophone since I was in high school.  All right.  And that's where I graduated.  It's a tech, tech, tech spedickey.  I worked with him for a little while.  Uh, let me read the caption.  Buddy playing a saxophone Christmas 2001.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Mr. Epson, if people order your CD from eatabullet.com, how many songs are on it? 
[02:25:30]  Oh, no, that's buddyepson.com, uh, no, buddyepson.com.  This is, uh, how many songs are you, idiot?  They're 14 on the CD, and the favorite turns out to be something I wrote from a two-and-a-half-year-old  granddaughter.  It's called Angelica.  Did you hear that one?  I didn't hear that one.  We're going to have to give that a listen.  Well, I'll give you the first line.  All right.  Okay.  Who put the jam on the pussycat's tail? 
[02:26:00]  Who put the grease on the banister rail?  Who put cement in the scrubbing up pail?  Who?  Angelica!  Who broke the milk bottle out on the drive?  Who squeezed the goldfish until they aren't alive?  Who spilled their mommy's Chanel No. 5?  Who?  Angelica!  Very good.  All right, buddy. 
[02:26:30]  Hey, I like that.  Do you have any grandchildren?  Uh, no, not yet, buddy.  I'm hoping to have my first grandchild very soon.  We're still working on kids, possibly.  You'll remember that song when you get a grandchild.  I'm going to listen to it.  They have a way of getting into things.  Yeah, I bet they do.  They cause a ruckus around the house, right?  A little bit of a ruckus.  Buddy, you got great-grandkids?  Do I?  Do you have great-grandkids? 
[02:27:00]  Any great-grandchildren?  Oh, no, no.  Not that I know of.  No?  Oh, hey, back in the day.  They may be keeping something from me, but I don't know of any.  Buddy, can you sing a line from another song on your CD, maybe?  A couple of little verses?  A couple of verses of what?  Any of the other songs that we can find on your CD?  Oh, I got a lot of songs.  You want some character songs like Wild Card or Baby Blues or... 
[02:27:30]  Snowshoe Thompson.  How about Snowshoe Thompson?  Yeah, let's hear that.  Snowshoe Thompson.  You want to hear a little of that?  Yeah, let's hear a little of that from Buddy Hudson.  All right, here we go.  Snowshoe Thompson used to carry the mail through wind and thunder, snow and hail.  He had no dogs and he had no sled, but one thought drove him straight ahead.  Go, man, go, got to get on through the snow.  Mush, man, mush, got to get on through the slush.  Go, man, go, means mush and Eskimo. 
[02:28:00]  So go, man, go, man, go, man, go.  Yeah!  The line is down and the bird is walking on the ground and the snow is rifted treetop tall  and nobody getting through at all.  Oh, go, man, go.  It goes on like that.  Oh, yeah, it goes on like that.  A nice one, Buddy.  Very good, Buddy.  And it's all available on Buddy's CD.  Hey, Buddy, it's got a lift on the last chorus.  Yeah.  So remember now when your days is grim and the drifts is tall and your hopes are slim 
[02:28:30]  and you don't see how you're going to get through,  old snowshoe made it and so can you.  So go, man, go.  Got to get on through the snow.  There we are.  A little lesson to be learned.  There you go.  A lesson to be learned.  There you go, Buddy.  Don't quit.  That's inspirational.  Hey, Buddy, last time you were on our show, you were singing a dirty version of the Beverly Hillbillies theme.  A dirty version?  Well, it was kind of a... 
[02:29:00]  Saucy.  Saucy, little parody version of that?  The closest thing to a dirty version.  A dirty version.  Of course, I sang a song from the hillbillies called,  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Oh, doggies.  Oh, doggies.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  It goes on like that.  It goes on like that, Buddy. 
[02:29:30]  What?  It goes on like that, then, huh?  It goes on like that.  I like that.  Because that's the kind of lyrics they're writing today.  Right.  Right.  That's what the kids are listening to.  Hey, I got an idea.  Buddy, can you do that again?  I want to help you along with that song.  You want to help you along with it?  Yeah, hold on.  Well, I got parts of it.  I'll tell you when.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I like that, what was that, the Well Doggy song?  Yeah.  Well, a Well Doggy song.  Yeah, give us a little more of that. 
[02:30:00]  A little more Well Doggy?  Yeah, Well Doggy.  I haven't written a song about Well Doggy.  Well, do it again, because we won't.  Well, what I'll do, you'll hear it on springboundmusic.com.  Page out of the old plug book.  Yeah.  But I got a variation on Well Doggy.  Oh, you do?  Not Well Doggy, but another song that I wrote.  All right.  And, oh, wait a minute.  Did you get the phone number in case you can't get the book? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, yeah, we got the phone number.  You want to give it out again, buddy?  Eight, eight, eight, two, eight, oh, seven, seven, one, five.  There you go.  And here is the middle part of the song.  Okay, let's hear.  The postman came the first of May.  The mailman came the very next day.  Nine months later, there was hell to pay.  Who fired the first shot?  The blue of the gray.  Well, babies.  Well, babies.  Oh, I get you.  That's a little racy there, buddy. 
[02:31:00]  Is that what you wanted?  Yeah.  That's a little more humor.  Yes, for something racy.  First hand.  That's as racy as I get.  That's as racy as you get?  Yeah.  Buddy, weren't you writing a parody version of the Beverly Hillbillies theme song?  A parody version?  What?  Well, I wrote another version of it.  It's not a parody.  Oh, okay.  Can we...  It's inspired by the Beverly Ballad of Jed Clamp.  See, that's what I think he was trying to do.  You get it when they send you the full CD. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, can we hear a little bit of it from you live, maybe?  Well, I don't know.  It's so unique.  Yeah.  I don't care.  There's lyrics around in my life.  Oh, yeah.  We found that out last year.  Okay, well.  All right.  I got other lyrics, but they're songs that are talking songs like they used to do on the radio. 
[02:32:00]  Like, smoke, smoke, smoke.  It's, you know, that kind of thing.  Right, right.  All right there, buddy.  Hey, buddy, we love you, man.  Well, thank you very much.  We're going to promote your CD.  It's, I don't know what the name of the CD is.  The CD is Buddy's Originals.  Buddy's Originals.  Yeah.  You can go to BuddyEpson.com.  You can go to Springbound.com.  Yeah.  Or you can give Buddy a call, probably personally, at 888-888-280-7715. 
[02:32:30]  7-7-1-5.  And don't forget, we're all riding on the same spaceship.  Ain't a time we start to get along.  Right.  As the world keeps shrinking, got to find new thinking, so the world can spin right on.  That's inspirational, Buddy.  Thank you so much.  Okay.  Buddy at the great Buddy Epson.  Buddy's got to leave with his well-doggy.  That's how he leaves.  Oh, that's right.  One more time, Buddy, if you could leave us with a great well-doggy. 
[02:33:00]  Are you ready?  Yes, sir.  You got the recorder going?  Oh, of course.  Well, here it comes for you.  Hey, you got to really, you know, pump this one out for us.  I'll pump this one out.  Ready?  Here we go.  Well-doggy.  Thank you, Buddy Epson.  Buddy Epson.  Buddy Epson.  Nice.  Got a few out of six.  You're the back.  I heard that.  Thank you, Buddy.  It'll be again soon.  Thank you.  Oh, we will, Buddy.  Believe us.  We love you, Buddy.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We'll call you tomorrow. 
[02:33:30]  Thanks.  All right.  The great Buddy Epson, everyone.  There's our brand new well-doggy for Buddy Epson for 2002.  For 2002.  And I don't think he, boy, he is something.  And he's still kind of sharp there.  You got a little bit of Opie to clap after he gave out a phone number.  That's not quite the great issue.  I was well-behaved.  Too condescending.  No, but of course you're well-behaved.  But the man gave out a number and you went, all right. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  He can speak.  Let me tell you something.  I was looking at the phone lines.  There was this one girl.  She hung up.  It was Lisa.  All Stinky wrote on the line is Lisa going, for the love of God, be nice to him.  Be nice to him.  Be nice to him.  Please, please, please.  She was just freaking.  She was just freaking.  What is this?  The well-doggy 2002?  Just did it live.  Nice.  Can we now?  All right.  We got to add it to our collection.  All right.  Can we have all of them?  We got to line them all up.  We got to line them up and get them all numbered. 
[02:34:30]  Look at us being unpredictable.  See, you bastard.  You thought we were going to be mean.  See?  I know.  Exactly.  Just when you think you know your pals Opie and Anthony.  Some guy said, Buddy Ebsen rules.  Didn't he fight with Davy Crockett?  Like Mark from Cleveland.  I feel so bad.  Leave this guy alone.  We were very nice to him.  Even when we're nice, people freak out that we're even on the phone with him.  Yeah, they're turning down their radios going, oh, I know it's coming.  I know it's coming.  Not at all.  See?  Sometimes you see the, sometimes the lion walks right past the gazelle. 
[02:35:00]  That's right.  You watch those nature shows sometimes and you're watching it and sometimes the lion walks right  past the gazelle and the gazelle don't even stop drinking.  That's right.  And he walks by and you're thinking, why the hell did he tear his throat out?  What about the...  You just can't tell what nature.  What about the alligators and the crocs?  Ah, the alligators.  Inches away from the gazelles as they're drinking the water.  And the alligator mentions, oh, he turns off.  Turns away.  Not interesting.  And not interesting. 
[02:35:30]  Just not interesting today.  Something as simple as you throw the mice in the snake tank.  Sometimes the snake don't even pay attention to the mouse.  Sometimes the mouse could just take a nice little nap.  And sometimes the snake plays a canned laughter over the mouse's story of his parents being  eaten by a snake.  You never know.  All right.  I got Will Doggy 97, 2001 and 2002.  I got 2000.  Okay.  So here we go.  Let's get this right.  You know what?  I'm kind of disappointed. 
[02:36:00]  I think he made a nice comeback last year.  He did.  I think he made a nice comeback.  He did.  He did.  You got to give it to him.  Maybe next year.  All right.  Here's Will Doggy 1997 from the great Buddy Epson.  BuddyEpson.com.  Will Doggy.  Nice.  All right.  And here is the year after.  Or 2000.  2000.  2000.  Here.  Use it or lose it.  Well Doggy.  A little bad.  All right.  Here's Well Doggy 2001.  Well Doggy. 
[02:36:30]  And ladies and gentlemen, we need like a drum roll.  We don't have one.  Here's Buddy Epson.  Well Doggy 2002.  Well Doggy.  He almost sounds better in this one than he did in the last one.  I would say definitely better.  Yeah.  This is last year, 2001.  Well Doggy.  Sounds like a brake screeching on at fault.  2002.  Well Doggy.  Give me the 2001. 
[02:37:00]  Give me last year again.  Well Doggy.  I'm like, car accident.  Lisa.  Yes.  Hey.  Listen, I know the way you two operate, okay?  Why?  I've listened to you long enough.  I was just waiting for something from you, okay?  You were scaring me.  I was yelling at the radio.  I know.  It was funny because you're on the line and all I saw was, please, please, please be nice  to him.  I was just yelling at whoever answered the phone, no, stop him, please, no. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, we're not going to hurt Buddy.  We've been talking to Buddy for years.  I know.  And he's been nothing but nice to you guys.  Yes.  And I know the way you operate.  Good cop, bad cop.  We don't want to be predictable, Lisa.  I know.  And that scares me, okay?  We don't want to be predictable.  I know.  But, you know, all Opie needs to do is play some soundbite and the man won't even understand  what's happening, okay?  Lisa, they had my hands tied behind my back.  Good.  Good.  I'm glad someone there has some sense of decency.  I was in a straitjacket for that last 15 minutes.  Thank God.  And my heart was, like, beating. 
[02:38:00]  I'm like, no, please.  I love that.  Do you know how many great, great clips we got from Buddy just in that call alone?  With Buddy going, like, well, doggy, well, doggy.  Well, that's the one I want.  Can you get the well, doggy song?  I like the way you made him say it a few times because you know he's not making it to 2003.  Well, doggy, well, doggy, well.  Buddy says, buddy says, well, doggy, well, doggy, well.  Well, doggy, doggy.  He was doing a well, doggy rap. 
[02:38:30]  And the doggy's getting in the back.  Oh, boy.  Dennis has a problem with our Buddy Epson interview.  Dennis?  Hey, let's remember you guys are being all, you know, proud that you guys weren't mean to Buddy Epson.  Proud?  Well, sort of.  Let's remember the real reason why you guys started calling him was to get the last interview before he died.  We gave up on that years ago, so we spun the bit differently.  You are so right. 
[02:39:00]  The first time we talked to him in 1997, that is what, now, five years ago, we were convinced he wasn't even going to make it to spring that year.  And we wanted the last interview with Buddy Epson, so we kept calling him.  And who would have thought we could have called so many other people to get that last interview?  Exactly.  You've got a good memory.  You've got a good memory.  You've got a good memory, but we spun it now.  We don't care about the last interview.  Exactly.  It's all about the O&A spin.  Very good.  Norton, move.  Thank you, sir.  We'll be back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Stay there. 
[02:39:30]  O.P.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony, so let's get to the trade magazine thing.  Yes.  Do you want to explain what we did yesterday and what we're going to do today?  Well, sort of like taking everyone behind the scenes.  Sure. 
[02:40:00]  Like Rick did at Universal Studios.  What you're seeing here is a facade.  It's just the front of the building.  But as we drive around back, look, it's just propped up in some two-by-four as another wood.  You might recognize this from the movie Spartacus.  You remember that, Rick, right?  Yes.  See?  Yes.  So what we like to do is drive the old radio tour bus behind some of the facades of radio, Opie.  Yeah, we like to break down that wall and explain to you what happens with other radio shows around the country. 
[02:40:30]  And yesterday we were learning all about contesting.  Yeah.  To make our contesting better on our show.  They forgot the most important rule, though, in contesting.  We read it yesterday, and I didn't see this anywhere in there.  Have a prize.  Have a prize.  That's a good one that they should learn here at N.E.W.  Any contest should have a prize.  All right, Anthony. 
[02:41:00]  So I got my hands on a radio publication.  This goes to many, many morning shows around the country to make their morning show better.  Right.  There's a few guys in this here city of ours that do these bits.  They share.  So these shows in the middle of nowhere, they do a good bit on their show,  and then they type a little e-mail letter to this publication.  Guys, you've got a great response from this bit.  Right.  Try it out in your city.  So they send the e-mail into the publication. 
[02:41:30]  Then the publication collects all the bits from all over the country.  Yeah.  And they reprint them as a feature called Best Bits of the Month, Anthony.  Yes.  And if you subscribe to this magazine that I'm holding,  you could do some of these bits at your radio station.  Right.  As they share to help each other out.  Are you ready for the Best Bits of the Month of September, Anthony?  Yeah.  Okay.  We start off with drive-by joking.  Drive-by joking. 
[02:42:00]  You send your intern out with a joke book  and have him insist on reading jokes to people waiting to cross the street or at the light.  That's a drive-by joking.  Yes.  And that's one of the popular things.  So we would send someone out on the street.  And made the Best Bits of the Month, yes.  With a cell phone or something, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  And they insist on telling people jokes while they're waiting to cross the street.  Would you like to try this bit today?  If it's one of the best bits of the month, sure. 
[02:42:30]  We'd be silly not to jump all over this.  Let's see how it does in New York City.  Where's Spaz?  Let's see if Spaz is willing to do this.  Spaz, are you willing to try out one of the Best Bits of the Month?  Yes, I am.  From this fine radio publication.  It's called drive-by joking.  Okay.  What do I have to do?  We're going to send you out on the streets with a joke book.  You've got to walk up to people and read jokes to people as they wait to cross the street or a light.  Okay.  Do we have a joke book?  Yes.  We do? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  What kind?  Anything good?  It's a dirty joke book.  A dirty joke book.  Dirty joke book.  Okay.  All right.  Go get the dirty joke book.  All right.  Hurry up and bring that back in here.  And we'll send you out to try one of the Best Bits of the Month, Spaz.  Yeah.  All right.  Very, very excited.  Also on this list of Best Bits of the Month that you can try at your radio station, at your show.  Yeah.  The Half Minute Run.  The Half Minute Run. 
[02:43:30]  What is this about?  Well, Anthony, it's pretty simple.  Mm-hmm.  You get two listeners on the phone, and they go back and forth answering a question with a question for 30 seconds.  Oh-ho!  They must ask a question back and forth for the full 30 seconds.  First one to answer the question without asking another question back loses.  Oh!  And that's one of the, like, bits of the month.  Best Bits of the Month.  All right.  You can put them in a situation, like, at the mall, a ball game, or wherever. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, oh, oh!  We can put them in a little situation.  And here's the joke book.  Here's the joke book.  You're at a whorehouse.  Go.  Hey, get two people on the line that want to play Half Minute Run.  But, Anthony, there's the joke book we're going to send.  All right.  We're going to send Spaz out on the streets with.  Get a sampling.  How did Yoko Ono get her name?  Oh.  When she was born, her father cried, oh, no, because he couldn't tell her face from her ass.  I'm just opening them up.  All right.  Why is Nancy Reagan like a dead camel? 
[02:44:30]  Why?  They're both very dry humps.  That's so funny, I forgot to laugh.  What's the most practical gift for Imelda Marcos?  What?  A shoe forest.  A shoe.  All right, Spaz.  What year did this come out?  Let me see.  I don't know.  Let me see.  Because some of these jokes are very, very dated.  Oh, 1988.  That's good.  We have jokes.  Hey, look.  Dice's material's in here. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  What do you call a female clone?  What?  A clunt.  I said that.  Hey, we might have to use that.  Yeah, use that one.  Circle that one.  One good one.  A clunt.  All right.  We got a couple people that want to play the Half Minute Run, Anthony,  as we try some of the best bits.  All right.  These are the best bits by other shows all over the country.  But why don't you send, why don't you give Spaz the joke book so we can try that bit  out on the streets of New York? 
[02:45:30]  I'm praying that you don't get punched in the face, Spaz.  Are you ready to play the Half Minute Run, Anthony, with a couple of our listeners?  Let's give it a try, Opie.  These are the bits that are supposed to make your show much better.  So, well, we have nothing to lose, right?  Absolutely.  All right.  Let's go to Mike on line three.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  You want to play the Half Minute Run?  That wacky game?  Yeah.  We really want you to try to play it, though.  I'll try.  Just make believe you're calling a really, really lame morning show, 
[02:46:00]  and you really got to try to win the prize, okay?  Got you, buddy.  And we will give you something if you do win.  All right.  What about if I don't win?  Then you lose.  Do you know how to play the Half Minute Run?  Break it down for me one quick time.  All right.  You're going to be at a conference with another fine listener of this radio show.  Okay.  You're going to ask them a question.  All right.  They have to, in turn, ask you a question back.  Gotcha.  The first person that answers the question from the listener loses.  Right.  And you've got to last 30 seconds. 
[02:46:30]  Ant and I will give you an example.  A quick example.  All right.  How are you doing?  How am I doing?  Is it going to rain today?  Have you seen the weather?  Are you going to the Met game today?  The New York Mets?  Or are you going to the Yankee game today?  Okay.  I don't have Down syndrome.  I have Down syndrome.  Shell Wolf.  This is bad.  See that commercial?  We've got to talk about that later.  This is pathetic, though.  This is one of the best bits of the month. 
[02:47:00]  So let me get you with Pete here.  Hey, what's up?  Pete, do you understand the rules of the Half Minute Run?  Yes, I do.  All right.  All right.  Who starts this?  I guess we'll pick whoever it is.  Should we put them in an interesting situation, O.P.?  Please do.  Yeah.  Let's make believe they're on a street corner in the middle of Manhattan.  All right.  You're on a street corner in the middle of New York City, everybody.  Mike, you're going to start out by asking Pete a question.  Remember, Pete, I'll only answer with a question. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Are you guys ready?  I'm ready.  All right.  Start the clock.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's synchronize.  In three, two, one.  Pete, go.  Who goes first?  Me or Pete?  Pete.  That was a question.  I know.  But Pete, go.  Hey, Mike.  What are you doing over there?  What are you doing?  I'm over here now.  That's not a question.  And you loser, Eddie.  You suck. 
[02:48:00]  But, you know, this is a great, great...  Woo-hoo!  Oh, wacky.  All right.  Who lost?  Pete won.  Mike won?  Woo-hoo!  All right, Mike.  Hold on a line.  We're going to give you a prize for playing.  You guys are the best.  Thank God you don't do this crap.  Thanks for playing Half Minute Run.  All right.  All right, hold on.  All right.  Anthony, make sure we write down that we played the Half Minute Run today at 4.50.  Because then tomorrow we can play it at 6.50. 
[02:48:30]  6.50, it'll be brand new for a brand new audience.  Right.  Because not everyone gets to listen to the whole goddamn radio show.  Right.  God, people are doing that.  Best bits of the month.  The Half Minute Run.  Well, that one didn't work too well, Anthony.  No, that really sucked.  Do you want to play the Shut the Hell Up game?  Shut the hell up, guy.  You want to give the rules to the Shut the Hell Up game?  Best bits of the month of September, Anthony.  Let me see the Shut the Hell Up game.  Hey, have a contestant conference with a spouse or friend. 
[02:49:00]  They can only repeat what the spouse or friend says.  They have 30 seconds to get their spouse or friend to say,  Shut the hell up!  Try to find a guy that'll call his wife or sister and play Shut the Hell Up.  It's called, You're an F'n A-hole.  The Shut the Hell Up game.  And then there's the Stop Calling Me That game, which is similar, Opie.  Yeah, what's that? 
[02:49:30]  But the contestant continuously calls their spouse or friend a predetermined name.  Example, Hoochie Mama.  Imagine that.  He's on the phone with his wife and he just keeps saying,  Okay, Hoochie Mama.  What do you want me to bring home, Hoochie Mama?  How are the kids, Hoochie Mama?  They have 30 seconds to get their spouse or wife to say,  Stop calling me that!  Hoochie Mama.  Hey, can someone, I'm going to play a game.  Shoot the DJ in the head.  If I'm playing a contest that really seems stupid,  Please come on up and just shoot me in the head. 
[02:50:00]  Holy smoke.  Best bits of the month of September, though.  Hold on, this guy's calling his wife to play Shut the Hell Up.  Ah.  Tony.  I forgot how to play that one.  It's very easy.  Explain the Shut the Hell Up game again, Anthony, to Tony.  The Shut the Hell Up game.  Have a contestant, which would be you two, a conference with a spouse or a friend.  They can only repeat what the spouse or friend says. 
[02:50:30]  They have 30 seconds to get their spouse or friend to say,  Shut the Hell Up!  Yeah, Shut the Hell Up!  Ho, ho, ho!  Wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, do it.  You want to play it, Tony?  Yeah, I'm ready.  We're going to get that live number and then we're going to play Shut the Hell Up!  Oh, all right, hold on.  Here we go.  Tony, it's going to ring in a second here.  Dad.  Hello?  Yeah.  Tom?  Yeah.  Hi.  Tom?  Hi.  What's the matter?  Are you all right?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? 
[02:51:00]  Why are you imitating me?  Why are you imitating me?  Where are you?  Where are you?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Your son's looking for you.  Your son's looking for you.  Are you trying to be funny?  Are you trying to be funny?  I'm busy.  I'm busy.  Somebody has to make money in this family.  Somebody has to make money in this family.  It's not you, obviously, that you're on the phone right now playing games.  Not you, obviously. You're on the phone somewhere playing games. 
[02:51:30]  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.  What are you doing right now?  What are you doing?  Where are you?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, Tony.  Tony's wife on the phone. What's your name, darling?  Joanne.  Joanne, we were playing a great groovy new game called Shut the Hell Up.  You see, your husband, Tony, has 30 seconds to repeat everything you say until you say, 
[02:52:00]  Shut the Hell Up.  We're on the radio right now.  I wasn't paying attention. What's your name, darling?  And I didn't say shut the hell up, and I always do.  What's your name, darling?  Joanne.  Joanne, I'm sorry. You don't.  Hey, Joanne, what's your favorite radio station?  Is this talk radio my favorite radio station?  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Don't be an athlete.  Don't be an athlete.  Don't be an athlete.  Well, thanks for playing the Shut Up game. 
[02:52:30]  I guess we don't have a winner this afternoon. We'll be playing this game again tomorrow.  At what time?  I think we'll play it at 345 tomorrow.  No, we have Battle of the Sexes penciled it for that time.  All right, there are Tony and Joanne.  Lovely couple. Thank you.  Thank you.  And don't forget, Shut the Hell Up!  That game blows.  Who's going to say Shut the Hell Up? 
[02:53:00]  Come on, man. That was good.  Someone might say Knock It Off, or What Are You Doing, or Shut Up.  But Shut the Hell Up, and then what if they just say Shut Up? Do they win?  They don't specify in this.  Well, it's one of the best bits of the month, according to this radio magazine that I got in my hand.  This is legit bits.  So bad.  All right, Spaz is ready to play the other game, Anthony.  All right, Spaz is on the phone.  Spaz, you've got to be our intern for this.  Spaz is going to be playing.  I'm laughing so hard, I can barely say it. 
[02:53:30]  This is what we call the drive-by joking.  We send our own Spaz on all the streets with a joke book.  And he is going to insist on reading jokes to people.  Waiting.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Waiting to cross the street.  Hey, Spaz, are you there?  Are you ready to play?  All right, Spaz.  Look, I am.  I'm trying to select someone right now.  Spaz, just walk up to somebody and just start telling them a joke. 
[02:54:00]  All this bit is fine to have.  What do you call a female clone?  A clunt.  Ho, ho.  What's she doing, Spaz?  What's she doing?  She's ignoring me.  What do most people believe is the most sensible position for a female to start in?  Throne.  Ho, ho.  Spaz, what's she doing now?  She's ignoring me still.  Ignore her still, Holy.  All right, I'm about to walk up to somewhere else. 
[02:54:30]  I don't know about you, Anthony, but I may crap my pants.  I already did, Ho, but you smell that in here?  I just crap myself.  I'm on the edge of my seat.  All right, I'm about to go up to someone else.  Excuse me.  You have to keep going.  You have to keep going?  Yeah.  I'm just telling a couple of jokes.  I'm trying to humor the crowd here before they go in.  But I'm just trying to get the crowd warmed up for Letterman.  Exactly.  We have to do that.  Thank you.  I have jokes.  I have jokes.  I can warm the crowd up for you. 
[02:55:00]  You don't even have to pay me.  He did a drive-by joke to the Letterman audience, and he got yelled at and kicked out by the  David Letterman people.  What do you call a teenage black kid who turns on a violent crack?  Dead.  First of all, don't make me do this, okay?  Don't do it, okay?  This is called the Letterman.  I'm trying to warm up the crowd for you.  Spaz.  Spaz.  I'm trying to make people laugh.  You keep telling jokes.  You can tell jokes on the sidewalk. 
[02:55:30]  It's allowed.  What does a black family do for a daughter on the 13th birthday?  I don't know.  Throw a baby shower.  That's good.  God, that is good.  Hey, Spaz, let's play a new game, okay?  Okay.  Called Punch the Bitch in the Face.  That's going to make next month's issue of the best bits of the month.  Hey, Spaz.  Excuse me.  Who circumcises whales?  Whoreskin divers.  Whoreskin divers. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, Spaz, are you still by the Letterman's studio?  No, they actually kicked me away.  They had two people literally pushing me away.  You're allowed to tell jokes on the street, you know.  I understand that, but they won't even let me on the block.  They pushed me across the street.  Drive by Joke and go apply.  Let's try this one more time.  We got our Spaz on the streets.  Do you know that the high divorce rate is largely a function of arithmetic? 
[02:56:30]  Because most divorces happen when wives put two and two together.  I don't know.  Do you think that was funny?  I don't know.  He doesn't even speak English.  He doesn't speak English.  Hey, Spaz, steal his wallet.  How dangerous are the cocaine wars in Miami?  Well, this Christmas, Bob Hope is flying in to entertain the police.  A Bob Hope joke.  He's been dead for like 12 years.  From 1988 when he could still breathe.  Coming up, horrible scopes. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, we're going to do the horrible scopes right after this fantastic bit.  Spaz, you want to try one more drive-by Joke?  Come on, Spaz.  Why was the whore with VD so worn out?  All she ever did was just eat and run.  Oh, the whore eat and run, you get it?  She's sucking a c***.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that.  But, yeah, yeah, she's doing that oral thing.  You're absolutely outrageous.  I got out of hand and I cursed.  All right, Spaz, any more drive-by joking? 
[02:57:30]  What has NASA decided to name the new space shuttle?  The Titanic.  Oh, the Challenger joke.  That's very topical.  I think DICE is using that at the garden.  All right, Spaz, I think this was a great bit.  Spaz, catch your lucky boy.  Let's back up into the studio.  What are you doing?  He's doing jokes on the street, helping.  How in slow line is that?  Did you hear about the movie starring the rampaging senior citizen? 
[02:58:00]  It's called Gumbo, Tired Blood Part 2.  Gumbo.  All right, come on, back up here, you wacky man.  All right.  We need coffee.  There he goes, our Spaz, everyone.  Yeah.  He's our Spaz.  You can't have him.  Our old Spaz.  Boy, he'll chew anything.  I'll be drive-by joking.  How insane is that?  Unbelievable. 
[02:58:30]  That's good.  I was hoping for some charro jokes myself.  Casey, what's going on in there?  Please stop the radio voice.  It's giving me douche chills.  What's the problem, Stacey?  Horrible.  Yeah.  It's totally horrible.  Stacey and the sunshine band on the phone.  Oh, Stacey and the sunshine band.  That's a good one, Opie.  Thank you.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  Bye, Stacey.  You're a twat.  What did I just say? 
[02:59:00]  Twat.  You can't say twat on the radio ad, but I leave that to the guys at WNW.  They can say anything over there.  We're owned by Disney.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We got to take a break.  Yeah.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, Annie W.  Am I the right caller?  What were you calling for?  Um, Donna Summer tickets.  Oh. 
[02:59:30]  Donna Summer tickets.  Are you a big Donna Summers fan?  Yes, but I'm more of a f***ing f***ing f***ing fan.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  She knows the right things to say.  Here we go.  Let me tell you something.  Mm-hmm.  You're going to see Donna Summers.  You're kidding.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Matter of fact, we're going to put you in the front row.  What do you say?  For Donna Summer.  What do you say?  I don't believe it.  Thank you very much.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Hey, what color panties are you wearing? 
[03:00:00]  I'm wearing a bathing suit.  Donna Summer wants to know.  What kind of bathing suit are you wearing?  A one-piece, a thong, a bikini?  A bikini.  I'm sun tanning.  Sun tanning.  And I'm by my pool with my radio with 0.5 on it.  Oh, boy.  She says it again.  Look at that.  Since she's mentioned the station so many times, I think another prize is in order.  You like the disco era?  Yes, I do.  The whole disco dancing thing?  Absolutely. 
[03:00:30]  How about a disco weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada?  Yeah!  That's right.  You'll be whisked away to Las Vegas, Nevada to see Donna Summer in Las Vegas.  Are you serious?  We are serious.  I can't believe this.  You just have to tell us one thing.  What?  What's the strangest object you've ever used during sex?  The what?  Donna wants to know.  Nothing!  You're a virgin.  No!  You're a big, fat virgin. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah!  Yeah!  I'm a big, fat virgin.  And what's your favorite station?  0.5.  She said it again!  Yeah!  You know what you're going to win now?  What?  A trip on the space shuttle.  Yeah!  The first person in space!  You're going to see Donna Summer on the space shuttle.  Isn't this fantastic?  Oh, this is wonderful!  Have you ever been on the space shuttle?  No, I haven't.  Have you?  Oh, it's beautiful!  Yes!  Fantastic!  It's going to have a big disco ball.  Mm-hmm.  They're going to decorate it all. 
[03:01:30]  Hey, do you know how to dial a phone?  Yes.  What's your favorite sexual position?  Hello!  Donna wants to know.  Hello!  Oh, no!  Is she hanging out finally?  She's gone.  Oh, my God.  It took forever.  O.P.  Anthony.  107.  WNEW. 
[03:02:00]  O.P. and Anthony?  Hello.  All right.  Well, tonight's a big night for Barbara Walters.  I know a lot of people are sick of hearing about Monica.  Trust me, so are we.  But we think that Monica picked the wrong person to interview her.  Yeah, what do we want?  The cushy little Barbara Walters interview.  She's been kissing her ass on The View, too, saying that she's such a sweet girl and, you 
[03:02:30]  know, she's a victim and all that happy horse crap.  You think Barbara's going to ask Monica, if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you  be?  Well, she'll do the same thing.  She doesn't all the interviews.  Get her to cry a couple of times.  And what is the over-under for crying tonight?  Oh, my God.  Forget about it.  First five minutes.  I'm thinking Monica cries four different times in two hours.  Four times in two hours?  First one being within the first five minutes.  Within the first five. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  All right.  You know, and honestly, I think it's going to be pretty boring TV tonight.  You know exactly what to expect when Barbara Walters interviews someone of high-profile  status like Monica Lewinsky.  Right.  No surprises.  No surprises.  And we have come up with a list of people we wish would have interviewed Monica.  Yeah, we have a couple of people in mind.  Sure.  It would have made much more riveting TV.  Yes.  For example, Anthony, Andrew Dice Clay.  Now, that would be an interview. 
[03:03:30]  Could you imagine if Andrew Dice Clay interviewed Monica tonight instead of Barbara Walters?  I'd watch that.  I'm just trying to think what that would sound like.  Hmm.  Wow.  All right.  I'd like to welcome this whale to my show, huh?  And you know you're a whale because I could see your blowhole.  Yay!  So, you're sucking Clinton's s**t, right?  Does he blow his s**t on that chubby face of yours?  Or does he pull out and c**t all over your big b**ks, huh? 
[03:04:00]  Come on.  Answer the question.  Answer the question, you whore.  Answer the question.  Oh, look.  Now she's going to cry.  Get up, Barbara Walters.  You're going to cry, huh?  Look at her a little bit.  Answer the question.  What, your mouth full?  You f**king whore.  Look at his s**t bag, huh?  I don't want you on my f**king show.  Get the f**k out of here, you c**t.  Ring.  See, now two hours of that, I would sit home and watch that. 
[03:04:30]  Without a doubt.  You know, that's an in-depth interview, a probing interview by the Dice Man.  All right, and we have a list of other people.  Yeah.  That's Dice interviewing Monica.  Uh-huh.  But there's others.  Sure.  Wouldn't you sit at home tonight, Anthony, and enjoy maybe Yoshi interviewing Monica?  Just fumbling over the language would be fun, I think.  I mean, Yoshi, what would that sound like, interviewing Monica?  Monica Ruinsky, you are very dishonored. 
[03:05:00]  Did you write a Clinton plick?  And I want to know, did he pork you?  That, too, I would watch.  That would be riveting TV.  I would tune in to the Yoshi interview.  Of course.  Of course I would.  But instead, we're stuck with Barbara Walters tonight.  Yeah.  Do we have another one?  How about, I don't know, Tom Brokaw?  Well, if you want to stick with the news-oriented person, maybe you don't want to go out on a limb with Dice or something.  Yeah, maybe Dice is a little harsh.  Tom Brokaw, Mr. Marble Mouth himself. 
[03:05:30]  I would watch that, maybe.  So you'd sit home and listen to that, right?  Yeah.  Now, I wonder what that would sound like.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  We're here with Monica Lu...  Monica Lu...  Lu...  Lu...  Lu...  Monica...  We're here with Monica Lu...  We'll be right back after these words.  Just kind of stumbling over her name.  I would watch that.  I'd watch that show.  It's a compelling, captivating television. 
[03:06:00]  Unfortunately, he would only get one question out.  Yeah.  You know, it would be enjoyable.  Anything with an L.  It would definitely, you know, spice up the interview.  Of course.  But we're stuck with Babs.  Yeah, we got Babs tonight.  I think we have a list of others.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a couple more.  Like, maybe William Shatner.  What would that sound like?  I would love that, you know.  Oh, I was talking about Star Trek before.  I was watching some of the old episodes.  William Shatner is the worst actor.  He really is.  I can't believe you're stuck here at... 
[03:06:30]  Dan.  Spock Bones.  You're a beautiful woman.  We're getting out of here.  What have you done with Lieutenant O'Ura?  If you continue this, we're human.  We will cease to exist.  How does he drunken Kirk in a bar?  Can you imagine?  Look at the cans on Earth. 
[03:07:00]  All eight of them.  Doc, you have to hook me up.  That bitch from Rigel 7 gave me some...  ...Bulfolian clap.  Earth's when I...  ...B.  Captain Kirk got more pussy in space.  AIDS and stuff.  This is one planet.  He's out there spanning the universe,  getting any kind of queef he can. 
[03:07:30]  Bones, help me.  Dammit, Jim.  Stop screwing green women.  And you wouldn't have this problem.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
