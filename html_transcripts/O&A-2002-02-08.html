<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast live from a balcony at Temptations Gentleman's Club overlooking Bourbon Street during Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, were subjected to a chaotic and overwhelmingly drunken crowd.  They were pelted with beads, and numerous women flashed their breasts.  The broadcast was riddled with technical difficulties and loud crowd noise, often making it unclear if they were even on the air.  

Prior to the broadcast, the hosts recounted their first-class flight antics, including harassing other passengers and a particularly unpleasant encounter with a large man.  Norton received a lap dance and conversed with strippers, while Opie was pressured into a potentially expensive VIP dance.  A bet involving smelling Norton's belly button, due to Opie's attempt to make them appear gay to other passengers, resulted in both Opie and Rich Voss becoming nauseous.

The broadcast itself featured a constant stream of crude and sexually explicit jokes and comments.  They promoted their "Naughty Nighty" contest and interacted with "Oasis," a woman known for giving free oral sex during Mardi Gras, and "Steffi," a woman with large breasts. An attempt to arrange a live oral sex act with a listener was stopped by club management.  They also discussed a woman's "fluff technique" and observed a woman's rash and bruises.  They promoted a gangbang website (triplexbiker.com, event date: April 6th, Washington D.C.).

A significant portion of the show focused on their contentious relationship with Tom, the seemingly intoxicated manager of their local radio station.  They repeatedly mocked his inebriation.  A woman from *Stuff* Magazine, identified only as John, was briefly interviewed about her sex column. A “bead war” ensued with other balconies, and Opie was hit with a bag of beads.  They recounted their previous night's experiences, including overcharged strip club visits and navigating New Orleans while drunk.  They bragged about embellishing their drug use to Tom, who seemingly believed them.  The quality of the women they encountered was repeatedly criticized.

Attempts to get women from the street to participate in the "Naughty Nighty" contest were ongoing, often involving photographer Rick.  Well Hung, a listener from their New York days, called in.  Repeated attempts were made to get Tom's wife to flash the crowd.  The hosts expressed frustration with the lack of control and organization due to the chaotic environment.  A guest who attended 48 Mardi Gras parades shared a story about a woman being exploited by multiple men in 1975.  Multiple fights broke out in the crowd below, including one involving a white man being beaten by three black men.  Pornographic materials were thrown to the hosts. A man, described as the size of a Winnebago, blocked their view. Foundrymusic.com was mentioned as the site where footage of the fights would be posted.  Bacardi was mentioned as a sponsor.  The show concluded with the confirmation that footage would be posted online, and Wayne Garrity of Carnival Connection was thanked for providing beads.  Throughout, the extremely loud crowd noise and the hosts' increasingly intoxicated state were major factors.  The show was frequently interrupted by marching bands.  A woman performed oral sex on Tom, which was witnessed by his wife via video chat or phone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show!  Isn't this something live?  Bourbon Street, New Orleans, Mardi Gras.  I don't even know where to begin, Anthony.  I know.  What a blast.  I gotta say, thank God for Absolute Vodka and Bloody Mary mix. 
[00:00:30]  They just realized it's us, Anthony.  We're up on this balcony overlooking Bourbon Street at a strip club called Temptation.  The girl's already showing us her boobs down below.  Give her some of our beads, Anthony.  There you go.  There's another one.  All right.  Oh, I gotta throw the beads out now, yeah.  Beautiful, beautiful woman.  Dude, I didn't think anyone knew we were here.  We started talking, and hundreds upon hundreds of people are just crowding in front of the balcony. 
[00:01:00]  Three or four really hot blondes have already showed their cans, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  What's up?  What's up?  Who is the beautiful young lady that just showed her cans?  Anthony grabbed the beads and she ran.  Did she?  She ran.  Any other girls?  One-on-one.  One-on-one.  One-on-one.  One-on-one.  Jesus, I love it.  One-on-one.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You can always tell the guys at the Yankee Caps have got to be fans of the show. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, we were setting up our broadcast on Bourbon Street, and they're still allowing traffic  to drive by on Bourbon Street.  Yeah.  This, what was it, like a white SUV, it looked like.  Yeah, it was a little minivan, and it had Wow's paint all over it.  Guys from Jersey, and they were waving up to us, but you know something?  I don't even think they knew it was us.  They had no clue, it said, O&A fans, wow, show us your G's, we're going to Mardi Gras.  What a crowd.  All right. 
[00:02:00]  Look how quickly this crowd.  You know, we've been on the air for three minutes, Anthony, and we're already the most popular spot on purpose.  Yeah, look at this, man.  I have so many beads around my neck.  You look ridiculous.  I look ridiculous, don't you?  Yeah, you look like every Puerto Rican hooker I've picked up.  We're throwing beads now, feeding the crowd.  And again, thank you.  You notice all the guys staring up at us? 
[00:02:30]  It's all guys.  It's all guys.  It's all guys.  Where are the chicks?  It'll take some time.  It'll take some time.  All right, it's absolutely.  It's pandemonium.  Insane.  All right, so let's start from the beginning, huh?  Yeah.  We left New York yesterday.  Whoa.  Wow, Jim Norton's got hit in the head with like the heaviest beads I've ever seen.  And if you want to know what it looks like here.  Oh, watch out.  Incoming.  There's 400 guys and 10 women, and the women outweigh the men. 
[00:03:00]  It's disgraceful down here.  Well, I guess later on at night it might get a little better, like the male-to-female ratio.  Let's see if she'll show us.  It is truly a sausage fest right now.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm starting to learn a lot of things about Mardi Gras, Ian.  First of all, we all have a real lot of beads that we're not sharing with anyone,  so what they have decided to do is throw their beads at us and attack us.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we're not giving up our beads fast enough. 
[00:03:30]  Hey, give it to the lady there.  There you go.  All right.  So, Ian, let's start from the beginning.  We're going to have to, like, blow off the crowd for a little while,  because they're just screaming.  I don't know what they're saying.  I know.  Yeah, so we're on Bourbon Street at this strip club called Temptations.  Yeah.  We walk in the joint.  They have one stripper dancing downstairs in the dark.  Is that all that's happening right now?  Yeah.  Huh?  We're trying to do a broadcast, and we don't give them the attention,  and they start screaming.  They get mad at us.  I'm trying to throw beads to a 90-year-old woman right now. 
[00:04:00]  Whoa, what was that?  A can.  All right.  They're throwing a beer can.  Oh, God.  I was hoping she'd get knocked over and paralyzed.  Jim is throwing beads at a 65-year-old lady.  That lady fell down because she couldn't puncture anything.  Keep throwing beads at her.  Maybe her hip will shatter.  Oh, there she is, the only...  Okay, now watch.  Let's see if somebody knocks her over.  Knock her over.  Knock her over.  I'm going for the fat one.  I'm going for the fat one.  There's one very hot African princess dancing downstairs in the dark. 
[00:04:30]  That's it.  That's it with, like, two guys checking her out.  Right, Jim?  Yeah.  All I know is when we were here last night, we decided to get in.  We went to the hotel, checked in, and then we went out.  And we came here.  Norton got a lap dance.  And I can't believe the conversations you carry on with the dancers.  Like, hey, how did you get started in the biz?  Like, he's doing interviews.  And she's grinding on his joke. 
[00:05:00]  Well, what are you going to ask her?  Which uncle is responsible for this profession?  I don't really like the lap dances.  No.  I didn't get one because I don't like the idea of sitting there and not moving.  You can't touch.  You can't grab.  I'm not into that.  The last night in, Norton was getting the lap dance.  One girl, you saw her.  She was working me like crazy.  Yeah.  Now, you, that's another thing. 
[00:05:30]  You had this conversation going.  She never took her clothes off.  There was no contact at all.  But you're sitting there talking to her like your old high school pal.  It wasn't my choice.  She was trying to work me for what's called the $200 VIP dance.  Get this.  Let me explain this.  $200.  So I'm sitting there and, you know, enjoying the festivities with the guys.  Of course.  And she starts small talking with me.  I'm like, oh, wow.  She likes me as a person, Ann.  She likes me as a person.  Of course.  And I'm talking more and more. 
[00:06:00]  And I'm like, so what's the story in this club?  And she goes, well, the, yeah, the lap dances are $20.  Or you can go back in the VIP room.  And for a half hour, it'll cost you $200.  $200.  So what do you get for $200?  So being from New York, I go, what do you get for $200?  This place is absolutely insane.  And she goes, and she goes, and she goes, a really good dance.  Yeah.  And I'm like, what is that?  Yankee cranky?  No.  Do you get a Hummer?  No, just a really good dance. 
[00:06:30]  Ain't no such thing for $200.  So she's just talking my ear off.  I'm finding out her whole life story.  She's from Alabama.  She lives in a motorhome.  She travels around America.  I know it all.  Her cat knocked over her fish tank in the motorhome.  I hate talking to strippers, man.  I hate it.  I had no choice, as you know, right?  I'm sitting there.  I'm hearing her whole life story.  Yeah.  Then I start thinking in my head, you know, maybe I should just give her the $200 so she'll  go away. 
[00:07:00]  Shut up.  So she'll shut up.  Now, there's no guy showing his mule.  There you go.  His beat's for you, sir.  Oh, God.  So you're a mule.  Disgusting mess.  There you go.  Hey, hey, girl with the cowboy hat.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Okay.  You know what I'm thinking?  Huh?  I'm thinking we're going to have to go inside for a little while if we even want to do a  break.  Because I want to talk about the plane ride here, which was a lot of fun.  You guys in your first class, we had fun harassing everyone in coach. 
[00:07:30]  And why don't we turn around and go inside for a minute?  You want to do that?  Yeah, because we've got to get some type of entertaining broadcast on the air today.  Guys are starting to show their mules.  We've been on the air for seven minutes, and I've seen more boobs than like three years  of being back in New York.  Why are you telling a girl to show her armpits?  Yeah, why show their pits?  Why?  Or ticks? 
[00:08:00]  Is it they're talking about a blood-sucking little insect?  They want you to show their ticks.  It must be a local custom down here.  Yeah, something like that.  Show your pits.  Show your pits.  Show your pits.  So, why don't we talk about the plane ride and all that?  All right, let's go inside here a little bit.  Just for a little bit.  We'll go back up.  Oh, my God.  The balcony in a bit.  Oh, that's much better.  Man, that is crazy.  Sticky, where's my hurricane?  All right, so we left the station.  Hey, why don't we turn down the crowd noise for just a minute?  We've got a cluster F. 
[00:08:30]  We've got a...  Oh, there it looked nice and quiet.  Ah.  Ah, phew.  Ah.  Wow.  My headache's going to go away now.  Yeah, we've got a mic just for the crowd noise, Anthony.  So, yeah, we left the show around 5 o'clock yesterday because we had to catch a, you know...  We had an 810 flight.  A flight out of Newark.  And for some reason, Norton decided you were his date and he was going to bump you up to  first class with all of his continental points that he has.  And trust me, it's nothing special because everyone in first class was convinced that 
[00:09:00]  we're a gay couple because this guy loves to make you feel uncomfortable.  Oh, well, on the plane, he'll be saying things like, a sweetie pie, do you want some champagne?  Yeah, how nice that is.  Pumpkin puff.  And then I have to go to the stewardess.  Look, man, this is just what he does.  Sure it is.  After a while, they don't believe you, you know?  Of course not.  And, well, they shouldn't.  So, I made a deal with Jim.  The beads are stuck on his head.  It sucks.  You are a mess.  Norton's getting strangled by the Mardi Gras.  I hate any place below the Mason-Dixon point.  He's getting strangled.  It looks like a big freaking snake around his neck. 
[00:09:30]  Someone's got to help him take the beads out of his skateboard.  Normally, these are inserted and then yanked out quickly at the magic moment.  Your beads go all the way down on the floor, you shrug little man.  You're a mess.  Awful.  Look, the beads, they hang nice on Ant and I, but when you put them on, they hit the  floor and drag.  So, we're in first class.  Tom, I can't handle more beads.  You guys.  And trust me, we're going to do an hour of radio on you in a minute here.  Yeah, you can, man.  Suck it up.  Oh, my God. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  That's the guy that runs the station.  That's another story in itself.  So, I got to explain.  Norton gave me first class because there was only one other seat available.  Yeah.  And everyone else is.  Yeah, everyone else is.  We were all companion flying.  Exactly.  We had companions.  So, I got to tell you, and I'm hoping other people from the crew will join the club.  Right.  Because it was getting so embarrassing in first class that I made a deal with Jim.  I go, dude, will you leave me alone with the gay crap?  Everyone thinks we're gay. 
[00:10:30]  It's not funny anymore.  He loves letting people think you're a gay couple.  I don't like flying as it is, especially after 9-11.  I'm really stressed out.  Could you just stop?  Right.  So, I made a deal.  He's been wanting me to smell his belly button for, what, about a year and a half now?  A year and a half.  A year and a half.  What?  What he does, dude, he takes his index finger, right?  And he gets a good one.  He gets a good one.  Just that you know that and you saw it, gay, right there.  No, it's not gay.  That's totally gay.  No, guys that hang out do stupid stuff like that.  You know, belly buttons.  Right. 
[00:11:00]  Well, you should hear about Rich.  A couple of men sharing smells.  Rich Voss has a smell that comes from behind his ear.  That's another story in itself.  Right.  It somehow transmits into his act.  Okay, listen.  So, Jim, you know, he gets a good one.  He puts his index finger and digs and digs and digs.  Yeah.  He goes, you smell this.  I'll leave you alone for the rest of the flight.  I go, all right, what the hell?  You smelt it.  I smelt it.  It is probably the worst smell I've ever smelled in my life.  Dead animal?  I started dry heaving.  What was it? 
[00:11:30]  Like a dead car.  He says it smells like grape jelly.  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Oh, now I got beads.  Hold on.  Tom, we're trying to do a broadcast for your radio station down here.  How about we wait?  You alcoholic.  I'll put it on after my headphones are off.  Because when you put them on over your headphones, all of a sudden, you're done.  All right.  So, I smelled the finger.  And now I'm part of this.  Here, Rick, have a pearl necklace.  I guess I'm part of a special club.  Because I think only I and Rich Voss have ever smelled your finger.  Voss actually vomited out the window. 
[00:12:00]  Some tranny hookers had their nose down there.  Voss vomited.  I was dry heaving on the plane last night.  That's disgusting.  So, he finally left me alone.  Two men in first class smelling each other.  Yeah, just getting along, taking it out, rubbing it on the other guy's chin, laughing.  So, we touched down.  And we did the mellow route.  We didn't do much in first class.  And we're waiting for you guys to come off the plane.  We were in trouble.  The rest of the crew from the O.P. and Anthony show stagger, stagger off the plane.  The whole freaking plane you made friends with, obviously. 
[00:12:30]  They hated us at first.  And then I got to credit Norton with this.  His gag that he pulls where people walk by and he goes, you dropped something.  And then turns away completely and does not acknowledge them ever again.  They'll be looking like, who said I dropped something?  What did I drop?  And you will not even make eye contact or anything.  I can't take credit for that gag, though.  It is a very old gag that people have been doing since the 1800s.  Well, you know something?  It's very funny.  Thou droppedest something.  It's very funny.  Is that your sword? 
[00:13:00]  And sometimes you just got to go, oh, excuse me.  And then they turn around and look.  We were doing this on the plane.  Like, no one could go anywhere.  Anytime, like, a guy or a girl would go to the bathroom or one of the flight attendants,  we'd be pulling these wacky hijinks.  And it worked every time.  And the more drunk we got, the funnier everything got.  And believe me, we were hammered.  You guys were really hammered.  Now, we had to trade seats around a little bit because the geniuses that put this trip together  decided to scatter us about the plane in random fashion. 
[00:13:30]  You didn't like the crack hotel we stayed in last night?  Yeah, that was also nice.  All right, we'll get to that in a little bit.  Well, no, why would you want to fly together with people you're on the itinerary with?  That would be silly.  Ah, silly.  So scatter us around the plane so we've got to make deals with people.  I had to buy a woman a drink to have her change seats.  And Ben and Stinky had a guy sitting between them that hated them when the trip started.  And then after a while, everyone was so drunk, they were like a-hole buddies.  They're all pals. 
[00:14:00]  So this big jock guy goes walking by and Ben goes, you dropped something.  And the guy turns around and looks, laughing, laughing, laughing.  He figures out that it's coming from our seats.  So I go, real funny telling him, you dropped something, Ben.  This guy looks at Ben like, you wanted to kill him.  Kill.  To kill him.  And this is what happened the whole ride there.  Like, I was thinking that the flight attendants were going to, because you can't screw around on planes anymore.  And it was getting to that point where everyone was intoxicated, and they were pulling things that maybe you shouldn't pull on an aircraft. 
[00:14:30]  A lot of fun, though.  Drunk off our asses.  And I think we had a better time in coach than you guys did in first class.  Oh, first class is awful.  We tried to get a guy to switch.  That fat slob.  That fat diabetic who I hope loses a toe today wouldn't switch with us.  No, he switched at first, but it was a whole hassle.  You know what, because he wants the aisle seat because he's so effing fat, he wants to be able to go to the bathroom without heavy equipment being used.  He was a disgusting fat body. 
[00:15:00]  You know what he says?  He goes, all right, I'll try it.  I'll try it.  You know, we're separate, we want to sit together, whatever.  He goes, all right, I'll try it.  And then he walks away, and then he comes back.  He goes, you know what, I tried it.  Dude, you left ten seconds ago.  Yeah, but I want to sit in my seat.  I'm like, oh, you know what the problem is?  If you're that goddamn fat, stay off of airplanes.  You're annoying to look at, and you're an inconvenience.  It's not our fault.  You can't stop shoving food into your lonely, fat mouth. 
[00:15:30]  Hire a flatbed.  That really annoys.  That's what his problem was.  He was so goddamn fat, he wanted to sit in the front where there was a little bit more room.  Right.  Oh!  Thank God we have a dump button back at the...  Yeah, the engineer down here in New Orleans is like, I can't take care of that.  I can take care of everything else you guys need.  We got the guy on the dump button back home.  I can't take care of the F word.  That's fine.  You know what else is great?  First of all, Stinky and Ben, you know, I like to drink, but I do it on planes. 
[00:16:00]  I'm very economical.  I have a plan.  I get a bunch of beer right off the bat and just line them up.  That way I can knock them back as the trip progresses.  Those guys, they're always asking the flight attendant for something to drink.  I mean, you hear the landing gear coming down, like we're that close to landing, and they're like, one more, please.  And she's like, no, we can't do this.  And then Ben is telling the flight attendant that it's Stinky's birthday. 
[00:16:30]  Like, that's going to work.  And she comes back later with a big bottle of wine and gives it to Stinky for his fake birthday.  But they're trying to get beers as like we're taxiing to the terminal in New Orleans.  All right, so we're at this strip club.  It's Temptations.  They say it's a strip club.  We have one girl dancing down the stairs in the dark somewhere.  We're right on Bourbon Street, so I guess this is for the locals.  If you're close, come on by and say hi, right?  Absolutely.  I think we're going to do some Naughty Nighties today, aren't we, Ed? 
[00:17:00]  Yes.  Last day to qualify for the Naughty Nighty contest, you go to opianthony.com.  Are some of the pictures you took after we left the station yesterday, Rick, online?  Holy jeez.  Not yet.  Not yet.  Look at that picture.  Scott, this happened about 7.30 last night, so Scott didn't get these yet.  We're hopefully going to upload these today.  Those are two nude girls going at us.  Two nude girls who came for a reshoot and decided to get a little frisky as well.  Winners.  Well, we could show these, because that's some good stuff happening. 
[00:17:30]  It's upper body.  So, Ed, the last day to qualify for the Naughty Nighty contest.  We're hoping some of the girls that listen to us down here in New Orleans comes down to  Temptations with their Naughty Nighties.  They got a little area set up for us.  Actually, we could do it right on this couch, right?  Yes.  We're still sitting.  Yes.  And we'll get their pictures taken.  They'll be in the contest as well.  Also, is the Homer chick coming by today?  Yeah.  She's here, as a matter of fact.  She's here.  Oasis is the woman that gives free hummers here during Mardi Gras.  How does she look?  I don't know. 
[00:18:00]  I didn't see her.  Awful.  All right.  Why don't we go back out on the balcony and see what's going on?  Oh, my God.  Why don't we get back, Anthony?  We've got to talk about Tom, who runs the station down here in New Orleans.  I'm still not totally convinced he does.  I cannot see how a guy like that could run a station.  All right.  He shows up hammered to the airport to pick us up.  He's offering to buy us drugs.  I don't know what's going on.  It's fantastic.  We're making our way back out to the balcony.  Here it is.  To see what the hell's going on. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, it's Temptations Gentleman's Club on Bourbon Street.  If you're looking to stop by.  Hey, look at that.  A lot of guys.  Where are the girls?  Sausage Fest.  What happened to the girls?  Goddamn Sea Fest.  All right.  All guys.  Where are the chicks?  I heard so much about the chicks.  It's hilarious.  The guys got signs that they show the girls after they show their boobs.  Yes.  And they rate the boobs.  Yeah.  One guy just showed a 10 to somebody.  Yeah.  But the numbers go all the way down to 1, eh? 
[00:19:00]  Right.  Of course.  1.  The bad ones.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Let's do that.  Let's take a breath.  I need a hurricane, by the way.  Yeah.  Why don't we get a round of hurricanes?  Yeah.  I think we're all going to need hurricanes at this point.  That'll get us going.  I predict by the end of this show, you will not be able to understand a word that comes  out of any of our mouths.  That'll be great.  That is fine.  I'd like an ice latte and a shotgun blast to the face.  I hate it.  Norton is miserable.  That's hilarious.  It is so funny. 
[00:19:30]  Mardi Gras was described to us by Jay Moore last week, and he's kind of accurate to a  point.  He goes, just imagine everyone you hate in the world, drunk.  Yeah.  Drunk.  Yeah.  That's it.  For someone like Jim that doesn't drink at all, this has just got to be a miserable  experience.  There's only a function for drunks, and Norton doesn't drink, so there's a problem there.  But I can always immerse myself in some type of sexually addictive behavior, but here  it's just $300 for a lap dance in this other place.  We're in $300.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:20:00]  It was $300 at the place called Topless Bottomless, and they don't get bottomless.  Yeah.  Well, you could dream about some unprotected gibbying up of body fluids between you and  some man, woman.  And the girls were fours.  Yeah.  And giving us an attitude.  Fours.  One guy got slapped in the face, and he got so scared, because these girls are tough broads.  He grabbed her doughy ass.  Doughy ass.  He grabbed this dancer's doughy ass.  So the girl turns around and smacks him so hard, I think he wet himself, and he ran out 
[00:20:30]  of the place.  It's not natural.  Well, one more thing about the lap dances, and this is everywhere.  It reminds me of when you put a little piece of meat on a dog's nose and go, stay, stay,  stay, and the dog's just quivering because he wants to eat it.  Well, you're sitting there.  You can't touch.  You can't move.  You can't grind.  Yet, it goes against every instinct you have as a man when a naked woman is gyrating in  front of you.  You want to just plow it.  And you can't do that.  That's why I do not like the lap dance. 
[00:21:00]  It's a big CTs.  All right.  When we get back, we're going to talk about the guy that picked us up at the airport.  Yes.  And, of course, we've got to talk about the crack hotel that we stayed in last night.  Yeah, because for some reason, we had to change hotels today.  No, when you go to a place, you never want to check into your hotel that night.  It's always better to check into another garbage hotel and then travel because there's never  any traffic around Bourbon Street this time of year.  So, why not hop into a cab?  Me and Jim are hauling our bags like an hour before the broadcast because they can't get 
[00:21:30]  a car anywhere near the hotel we're staying at.  Yeah.  And then, we also got to talk about how me and Stinky couldn't find our hotel last night  when we left Bourbon Street drunk and walked around for an hour looking for our hotel.  All right.  Yeah, plenty to do today.  We'll meet the Hummer chick next.  Yes.  One of our listeners will get a Hummer today on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're broadcasting live at a club called Temptations, a strip club.  They're real nice here.  The girls are beautiful.  Right on Bourbon Street.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:22:00]  Welcome to the bottomless pit of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That thing's hilarious.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show broadcast live on Bourbon Street from Mardi Gras.  Yeah.  At Temptations Gentleman's Club, Anthony.  I just saw the biggest set of cans from a girl on the street. 
[00:22:30]  Everyone threw beads when she whipped those out.  Which one?  They were huge.  Which one?  Sloppy huge, but big.  Nonetheless, I don't know where she went.  Like the girls, they'll show, they get their beads, and they move on.  No, they fly.  What's the end game on this, though?  I don't understand.  Like, they get the beads, and then?  Well, it's something we have discussed in the past.  It's called buying the myth.  Buying the myth.  When you're in Mardi Gras, you know, the beads mean everything. 
[00:23:00]  And, you know, you walk down the street, if you're a hot girl and you have a ton of beads,  you have status.  On Bourbon Street.  It's okay, so it's during the time you're here.  But then you go back home to your little town or something, and it means nothing.  You showed nothing, and you have more beads than anybody I've ever seen, Opie.  I know.  I don't really understand it.  And we're in the bathroom, and this is true.  I finished taking a leak in Opie Walks, and with all those beads, he's like, hold my beads.  And I'm like, drop dead.  I'm not holding your beads.  Well, you should do getting very close to this trip.  I didn't hold my left. 
[00:23:30]  No.  It's amazing.  And we weren't leaking together.  We were just kind of overlapping.  No, it's a dilemma.  Look how long these beads are.  They're like 20 feet long.  They're dragging on the floor.  Dude, leak on them and throw them out.  No, I did.  No, I swear to God, because I didn't know what to do.  Look.  Look.  What am I going to do?  Oh, God.  Just dump them in the urinal as you go, and then throw them to the crowd.  You think these people are going to notice, Anthony?  Hell no.  The sidewalk is full of the same stuff and some vomit.  I am so easy.  I'm not even asking the girls to show anything, because we see it all back in New York. 
[00:24:00]  So, I mean, it's totally cool, but I'm just throwing them out here.  Yeah, I know.  I don't see a lot of girls showing.  What is that child doing here?  And don't start yelling to her, Norton.  Now there's horses and buggies coming through.  Did you see the crew from Cops?  Yeah, we were talking to the guys from...  Live from Mardi Gras.  We were talking to the guys from Cops last night.  Yeah.  What a blast, though.  We're working on frozen hurricanes, by the way.  We have the liquid ones, and I don't like them as much as the frozen ones. 
[00:24:30]  I have a feeling I'm going to be leaking hurricane tomorrow morning.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  You want beads for your girl?  Hey, does she earn those?  Pull up that shirt.  Pull up the shirt.  Oh, see, I'm too easy, man.  I'm not...  Yeah.  They're starting to figure it out that they can get beads real easy from this balcony, you know?  I know.  I'm learning.  I'm learning as we go here.  We're like the easy guys.  We're going to have to let them work for it.  No, you have to work for it. 
[00:25:00]  You've got to work for it.  You've got to learn.  Because we are taking pictures that we're sending back, and we're going to put them up on opianthony.com and stuff.  You know what would be really cool?  An 8.30 flight tonight.  Norton is miserable.  There's a horse and buggy walking through here.  The horse is miserable.  Norton's miserable.  This started last night, too.  Wait, wait.  Can I just make an observation?  It'll make a lot of people giggle as we paint the picture for the folks back home and all over America.  Jim Norton looks like Howard Cosell right now, doing freaking Monday Night Football. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, we've got to get a picture of him.  You look awful.  He's got the combination headphone-microphone slung in front of his face like an astronaut.  Looks nice on a weak chin, doesn't it?  He is absolutely miserable, and this wasn't helped at all by Tom, who picked us up at the airport.  What is his title?  Mickey Rourke from Barfly.  That's what his title is.  He didn't even come to the game. 
[00:26:00]  His liver showed up to pick us up.  Yeah, where is it?  Yeah, there he is.  He showed up at the airport with a drink in his hand, hammered.  Yeah.  And he's like, isn't this great?  You can drink at the airport.  Like, it was the best thing in the world.  Dude, I bring an ice chest everywhere.  Do you?  We bring games everywhere, you know?  What's a couple of cold ones?  What is that?  That's not booze.  So he picks us up, and Norton is just, like, disgusted.  He's getting pissed.  No, I don't hate him.  Yeah, you do, but he's here, and you're not going to say it to his face. 
[00:26:30]  Actually, he was a very nice guy, but he was just a lot larger than I am.  We made him stop for beer on the way to the hotel, and you know Norton doesn't drink.  He doesn't smoke anything.  And meanwhile, he's in the limo on the way to the hotel, being just bombarded with booze.  And then somebody started throwing ice at him and blowing pot smoke in his face.  And Norton's like, at one point, he actually turned around and goes, look, ass, I'm an addict. 
[00:27:00]  Stop it.  Blowing pot in my face while little blonde-haired Ope is lobbing ice cubes at me from across the limo.  And he hits me in the ear, and he's just giggling and happy, and his little blonde locks are flowing.  I was so aggravated.  Houston, we have a problem.  I hate these stupid headphones.  So I was Tom's best pal, right?  Yeah.  So I'm, like, making like I'm smoking the pot and everything.  Right.  Well, I'm not, you know, because I don't smoke pot anymore.  I'm faking it.  But we were like best pals last night. 
[00:27:30]  We were all, man.  Yeah.  I love you guys.  I love you guys.  And I feel like I've known you forever.  You should almost, I don't know if I should even bring up what we asked him to get under the guise of stuff.  You know something?  He'll get anything for us.  Don't matter.  Prostitutes.  Illegal narcotics.  Let's just put it this way.  The guy is committed to this program, and I love it.  He's under the impression that I do things I don't do anymore.  Stinky, what are those?  They're not slushies.  God damn it.  Well, you guys got to go back to the place you went last night. 
[00:28:00]  They're like Slurpees.  Oh, is that one?  Good.  I'll grab that.  All right.  So, yeah, Tom annoyed Jim to the point where Jim almost punched him in the face.  Yeah, you can't blow pot smoke in Norton's face.  And we're like, well, okay, so the ride was a little weird, but I'm sure the hotel's going to rock.  Look, when you hear Holiday Inn, you automatically think amazing place.  I knew it wasn't going to rock.  Norton is the pickiest son of a bitch, too.  I really am a high-maintenance little chap.  He storms out of his room and runs down to the desk to say he didn't like the double beds, the two beds in the room. 
[00:28:30]  What's your problem?  Just the idea of your little body on a huge king-sized bed is disturbing me.  That's better.  Thank you.  You know, I don't know why I really wanted a king bed, because if I did happen to get a girl last night, I never would have wanted her to stay in the bed with me.  I would have wanted her in the other bed, so I really don't know why.  Kick her off. 
[00:29:00]  Let her sleep on the floor.  Get in the other little bed.  Hey, why don't we talk to the Hummer chick that we were talking to her yesterday when we were in New York.  Let's go inside, away from the crowd for a minute.  No, no, no, because they're not bothering us.  It's kind of nice out here.  Oh, you want that?  Yeah.  Okay, then we'll bring her out.  All right, we'll bring her out here for a little bit.  One of our listeners will be getting a Hummer today, courtesy of the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're at Temptations Gentleman's Club, Anthony.  They got mad because we were saying Strip Club.  Yes, Gentleman's Club.  They like to be called Gentleman's Clubs now. 
[00:29:30]  I see nothing but gentlemen.  So I apologize to the fine folks at Temptations.  I see nothing but here she is.  Here's the Hummer chick.  Hey, how you doing?  Hummer queen.  Can she get a mic?  Rick?  Maybe she could get a microphone.  You might have to do the old ask the question then, but the mic and the microphone in her face.  Hey, who's your friend with the big boobs?  My friend Steffi.  Steffi?  Yep.  Do we get to see those?  Yeah.  Yeah, good.  Wow, look at that.  Wow.  Hey, Rick, get a picture of that. 
[00:30:00]  You want to show it up?  Hey, wait.  Let's try it, Ann.  We're newbies to this.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  She's got real...  How big are those?  How big are they?  Yeah.  They're 36D.  And they're 36D.  And they're both pierced.  Yes, and it says girls don't on the front of your shirt.  What does it say on the back?  Put your imagination there.  Ah.  Girls don't say no.  Yeah, there you go.  That's pretty much it.  Girls don't spit.  That's a good one.  Or girls don't hang themselves when they're done, unfortunately. 
[00:30:30]  Girls don't spit.  All right, Anthony, this is what she was saying.  She's got huge cans.  Look at the crowd already crowding around our balcony.  She says if she shows those boobs that we're going to get bombarded by bees.  So why don't we give it a little try?  All right, let's see.  Go ahead.  Let her rip.  You guys, you want to see this or what, huh?  Here we go.  Watch this reaction, Ed.  These are huge.  She's doing a whole presentation.  I like it.  I have a website, too.  Well, of course.  What's your website?  XXXBiker.com. 
[00:31:00]  XXXBiker.com.  All right, she's teasing the crowd.  We've got close to 1,000 people in front of our balcony.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  They show up real fast when they know there's some action happening on the balcony.  And here she goes.  Wow.  Oh, she was really nice.  Oh, my God.  Duck.  Incoming.  That's great.  We just got pummeled.  That's hilarious.  They check out the merchandise, and then they decide if it's worthy of the bees, and then  they just start tossing the bees.  And they just bling them.  It's kind of like ancient Rome without all the dignity. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, I want to do that one more time.  One more time.  One more time.  One more time.  One more time.  One more time.  Here I go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the bees.  Oh, the bees.  She's really blowing the bees.  She just got clocked in the head.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, that's so great.  That's fantastic.  Oswald threw bees from the book depository.  Hey, Oasis, how you doing? 
[00:32:00]  Good.  How are you?  Very good.  Did you give any BJs today?  I have not given a single BJ yet today.  So, I guess you're just yearning to get a little sea in your mouth.  I'm just waiting for it, you know?  Yeah, who is it?  Norton, right?  Well, you know, normally you don't want to do it before 12.  That'd be slutty.  Heaven forbid.  Now, would you give the crowd a little show?  Maybe give them a little flash?  I could do that.  Oh, right.  My boobs aren't like Steffi.  No, you know something?  I've got long-bound boobs.  You know something?  I've got to tell you something, though.  You should know more than anybody. 
[00:32:30]  Boobs of any size, men just adore.  I love my boobs.  They adore the breast.  I can't, you know?  All right.  Let's see what the crowd thinks.  When Oasis shows.  Let's just see what the crowd thinks.  My God, this is the most popular spot on Bourbon Street right now.  I don't think she's going to get the same.  Oh, you brought a video?  I don't think she's going to get the same.  And what are you doing on that video?  All sorts of stuff.  I think it's a gangbang.  It's a gangbang, a gangbang video.  Yeah, a gangbang video.  Hey, I've got to ask Oasis.  How many Hummers are you going for today?  For today? 
[00:33:00]  I don't know.  I don't set a limit.  I just take all of them I can get.  Well, what do you think?  Are you good for 10 today?  Oh, I'm good for more than 10.  More than 10.  How many?  Were you out yesterday?  Were you here yesterday?  I was here yesterday, yeah.  How many Hummers?  You know what?  We didn't really go out and do a whole life yesterday.  I got like 2, 3, and 80.  You must be yearning, yearning for a little bit of man junk today.  Right?  You've got to be.  Would you go down there and do it right now? 
[00:33:30]  I would not go down there on the street and do it now.  No?  But up here you would, right?  I'll go on the street.  What about if we get a little corner over here and get a lucky listener?  Yeah, I would do that.  Wow, how about that?  Hey, Rick.  Get Rick over here.  All right, Rick.  You know what's going on?  It's so loud, I don't even know who can hear us.  You see this balcony over here?  Oasis is willing to give one of our listeners a Hummer right now on the balcony while thousands  of people watch.  You think you can go down there and find one lucky guy?  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  Sure.  Do you have a wireless mic?  I don't think it's going to be that hard to do.  See if you can get a wireless mic.  We'll talk to you on the street.  Oasis, what do you say you show the crowd a little bit of your, well, show them whatever  you want to show them.  I know that.  All right, first of all, she's going to throw a tape.  She's going to throw a video.  That's going to knock somebody out.  Because everyone has a VCR on Bourbon Street.  What are you thinking?  There she goes.  She's got her famous tank top on it.  It says, free DJ.  Free DJs. 
[00:34:30]  But it's the actual word instead of the, oh, God.  Here comes the marching band.  And that tape is actually funniest slut bloopers.  Wow.  Boy, that's not too annoying.  Hey, Jim, what are you thinking?  Oh, I hate parades.  Here comes a parade, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  We were just having a great party in front of our balcony.  Girls were showing their cans.  Guys yelling, whip them out, whip them out.  We got the girl that wants to give the free homer.  We got the girl with the huge, huge boobs. 
[00:35:00]  And out of nowhere, a stupid high school marching band is coming by our balcony.  Norton, a marching band.  Oh, this sucks.  What are we, at the Rose Parade?  Oh, this is so awful.  Oh, my God.  Who saw this coming, Opie?  How the hell are we supposed to function with a goddamn marching band?  Wow, this was a brilliant idea to broadcast outside.  This is awful.  You're broadcasting right now in Germany, 1945. 
[00:35:30]  This is horrible.  Well, um...  Well, the...  You know...  Oh, they're telling...  They're asking the girl to plan.  There goes Oasis.  Watch out for the beads.  I'm throwing beads.  Watch out for the beads.  They're flying now.  Notice not many beads came flying when Oasis showed her cans.  Hey, Oasis.  Do you show...  Do you show anything else to the public?  I show it all.  All the time.  You do?  You show it all.  You show that beautiful beaver of yours?  Yes.  Yes, she does, Opie. 
[00:36:00]  I'm going to try to get somebody to fall into the market.  Hide the crowds.  Oh, she's undoing her belt.  She's undoing her belt up here on the balcony as the stupid marching band goes by.  You want to see some clam?  Wait, here comes the clam.  Holy S.  Wow, now...  Okay, the beads are flying out.  Here they come now.  Oh, you'll do that to...  Hey, how about some more?  All right.  All right.  There you go.  I think the guys at the...  The guys in the parade want to watch. 
[00:36:30]  Look at the guys playing drums.  Look at the guy playing drums.  He can't concentrate.  Back up, they can't see it.  The freaking band decided to stop right in front of our spot on the balcony, Anthony.  We give you clam.  We don't even give you just the boobs.  We give you clam.  I'm trying to throw the beads so somebody falls into the drummers.  Hey, that's a great idea.  Look out.  We just messed up the whole band because this chick is showing her beaver. 
[00:37:00]  Now, listen, they're not even playing right anymore.  They're not even on time.  Watch, I'm going to peg one of the drummers.  Wow.  How about a little ass?  They'd love your ass.  They would love your ass.  All right.  And Oasis, the Hummer chick is...  Yeah, she goes.  The whole band is dropping her pants.  And...  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Jim, what did you think of that?  I didn't see it.  I didn't see it.  You're lucky. 
[00:37:30]  Look at the tuba players are all turned around.  We screwed this whole band up.  This is so great.  They stopped.  The tuba players stopped playing.  Nice catch.  Are these guys important down here behind the band?  I don't know.  They're all wearing suits, but they're looking at the clam, Opie.  All right.  It just goes to show you, it doesn't matter who you are or what you do.  Guys love clam.  Guys love the clam.  What happened to Rick?  He was supposed to go down and find one of our lucky listeners.  All the drummers are looking up here.  This is great. 
[00:38:00]  They're all offbeat.  I wish they would move away from us, though, now, because it's getting hard to hear.  Why don't we go inside for, like, two minutes?  We'll go inside for a second.  Hold on.  I'm also getting pummeled by beads.  Ah, this is better.  That's the first time we had a band right on our parade.  Wow.  All right, we're back inside for a breather.  I got grazed in the head by about a 20-pound pile of beads.  That was hilarious, man. 
[00:38:30]  The one girl with the really, really nice, huge boobs.  She had so many beads thrown at her.  And then Oasis, it's not her specialty, the boob thing.  She's more into giving the hummer thing.  Yeah, and she showed her boobs, and I think we got hit by, like, one or two.  Somebody politely threw a bead.  A bead.  Hey, Rick, we found a guy?  Let me ask you.  This was not the thing I wanted to be walking around the street asking guys if they wanted  a hummer.  All right, bad idea.  But I found Gary here from Baltimore. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, you're from Baltimore, huh?  Baltimore, yeah.  You listen to the O&A show?  No, I never have.  Yeah.  No, that's Washington, you know.  Oh, man.  I don't know if we should.  We got to give it to a listener.  You know, I talked to a few listeners down there, and they were like, they looked up at  her, and they went, nah, no, no.  Wow.  Yeah.  What a bunch of faggots?  Why would we do that to our listeners?  He's kind of right.  You know what, though?  The guy, um...  Do you get WJFK in your area?  No, we don't.  Oh, okay.  He doesn't get it. 
[00:39:30]  Well, why don't we take care of the guy anyway?  That's okay.  All right, we'll do that.  Let's go back out to the balcony.  Oasis.  Oasis is over first for the little meet and greet.  Oasis, come here.  Okay.  We found a guy.  Is this guy suitable?  This guy's suitable.  Sure.  Yeah.  Would you like to accept some oral treats from her?  That's the biggest challenge, though.  I'll tell you right now.  The biggest challenge is for you.  That's hard.  I know.  A lot of people can't do it.  All right, let's go out to...  It may not be the pressure of the crowd, Oasis.  A certain part, if you would follow Oasis over to this side. 
[00:40:00]  Go ahead.  Jim's like saying, no, no, no, don't do this outside.  What are you kidding?  We share everything with our listeners.  You have to.  All right, here we go.  All right, we're getting back out to the balcony, Anthony.  Oasis is here.  What's your name again, bro?  Gary.  Gary?  All right, Gary's from the Baltimore area.  Yeah, I think they're going to have to be where you are, Opie.  So why don't you come over here.  All right.  Now, let's get the lovely couple in that little area.  There you go.  Right over there. 
[00:40:30]  Right by the...  In that little...  Yeah, right there.  Wow.  Yeah, you are right there in front of them.  Didn't this guy eat some murder gay guys and eat them?  Anything.  Now, you know, just go to town.  Dude, here it is.  Your moment.  Check this out.  And she's going to do what she does.  Don't block my view, Anthony.  All right, we got...  Excuse me, paparazzi.  Could you go back and see the Hummer happening?  We're back on the balcony on Bourbon Street.  We're at Temptation Gentleman's Club, Anthony.  Okay, yeah, yeah. 
[00:41:00]  Now, the beads are probably going to come flying over here when this happens.  They're trying to figure out the logistics of this thing.  Can they go over the ropes and go over the ropes?  Yeah, if you want to go over the ropes there.  Go over the ropes.  Uh-oh, the girl is down on her knees, Anthony.  Here we go.  We're not going to be able to explain too much of this.  You guys, check this out.  What happened?  We're cut off. 
[00:41:30]  What?  What's wrong, Tom?  Get Tom over there.  On your knees.  Hey, what's the problem?  On your knees.  On your knees.  Tom, with the bring on your knees.  We're creating quite a problem right now.  What's the problem, Rick?  What happened, Rick?  let's just say  this isn't legal  why not  oh I don't know  talk to the officials  they're shutting us down  they're shutting us down  and the whole crowd is saying 
[00:42:00]  on your knees  we got probably  probably 5,000 people  in front of us right now  I think Tom's upset  because there are no drugs involved  oh man  what happened  who pulled the plug  who pulled the plug  who is pulling the plug  who's pulling the plug  put it this way  I'm sure I'm going to be  putting this fire out forever  you know  you gotta learn  this is what you gotta deal with Tom  with the ONA show  right  this is you know

[00:56:00]  that point  I understand that  why is the gangbang  chick still here  I thought she was  going to  I thought you were  going to a hotel  don't push her out  but then I saw  Norton was talking  about  well you've got to  range  she gangbangs  I have a shot  oh my god  barely  I know  you're awful  alright well we got  the Whitney Houston  looking lady here  the young Whitney Houston  before the crack  and Bobby Brown  yeah before  Bobby Brown  Bobby Brown  F'd her up  man  I would say  what happened  I don't know  all of a sudden  she's all emaciated 
[00:56:30]  hey Rick  did you get a picture  of Whitney Houston here  please  please do  you almost have  Marissa Tomei  in her heyday look  what's that  Marissa Tomei  in her heyday  I get that a lot  very good  that's a great look  to have  thank you  so she writes  the column  for Stuff Magazine  we were  discussing before  we got rudely  interrupted by  the latest band  she was some kind  of expert  in the realm  of sex  some kind of expert  are you experienced  in the uh 
[00:57:00]  is that how you  is that how you  get your knowledge  your carnal knowledge  a lot of field work  a lot of field work  is that what it is  a lot of common sense  I talk to a lot of women  about sex and men  and they tell me  all the dirt  that's what I do  basically  I get four women  together every month  and talk about sex  and men  and that's like  in the magazine  I see sometimes  how men could better  do this that  and the other thing  exactly  you're letting us  you guys need some help  sometimes  you're letting the secrets out  hey  not me  not you  I know everything  I need  you know everybody  put it this way  what do you think  about these girls 
[00:57:30]  who were out here  before the professional  fluffers  there's nothing  above a four  in this whole state  I haven't seen  anything above a four  you'll spend a lot  of time looking  at the top of my head  okay enough said  I like that  I enjoy that  well that's good  you know what I mean  your men should enjoy that  I like being down  in the action  what are you pointing at  oh yeah  I was pointing at  all of a sudden  I pointed right at her lap  yeah  I was like right down there  in that area  that's really classy  one hurricane  all of a sudden  that's what I like  I'm pointing with my pinky 
[00:58:00]  as I hold a drink  right there  that thing  great  you know the baby maker  wake wake  that's not what to say  to a girl  why didn't you understand  what I was talking about  I didn't know what you meant  it's funny  the girl  the Mother's Day parade  is behind us  I can't hear  what's poking me  in the back of the head  right now  a camera  the camera guy  I've been bumping  into everyone  that's alright  now you were hoping for  huh  oh god  so give us a tip  one tip from the stuff  sexpert here  what is something  the guys can better do  to uh  yeah 
[00:58:30]  yeah  that's probably a bad one  let them dump out of that  well they don't like the T word  they don't like the T word  so say it again  say it again  using like boobs  or something  so better pick up the women  by saying  show us your  T's  exactly  sorry about that  I didn't know  I was supposed to say that  that's alright  no but basically  you just  you know  gotta be nice to a girl  you gotta know  what she wants  and talk to her  and be very very good  at the technique  how about  how about  if you do what I tell you  you'll live through this  no that's probably 
[00:59:00]  not good either  Norton  something tells me  you're not gonna like that  this lady wants us  to talk to the ladies  these ladies down there  don't even know  their name at this point  I know  no they don't  oh my god  alright is the band  through  can we go back out  on the balcony  I hope so  let's take a peek  cause the furthest  we can get away  from Tom  the better we're all  gonna be  alright what the hell  is this  it's a parade  oh still  there's a mule line  Opie  look  it's the mule 
[00:59:30]  drawn buggy  Norton  what do you think  doesn't that look  like fun  I feel like I'm  broadcasting  the Rose  Rose Bowl  parade  the only good thing  is if the horse  takes a dump  it will improve  the odor  on this block  have you ever seen  so much puke  in your life  no  oh  Jim Norton  not a fan  of New Orleans  I'm kind of  picking that up  well  if you don't  drink  this is not  the place  you should go  on vacation  look at the horse  it's hurt 
[01:00:00]  aww  hey Anthony  you were gonna  discuss  Tom  we're trying  to do a broadcast  yes we have  enough beats  thank you  thank you sir  holy ass  Anthony  so we went  out to  Bourbon Street  last night  just to check  out the whole scene  we got here  really late  we didn't get  down here  until like  1 in the morning  or so  yeah  and we checked  out a couple  of the strip clubs  like we said  earlier  we were in  this one club  where they're  harassing us  for like  200-300 bucks  for a dance  in the back room  and they were  fours as Jim 
[01:00:30]  Norton would say  we should have  come here  to Temptations  immediately  because we went  to some other  place first  and I loved  my thimble full  of Captain Coke  that was nice  and yeah  wasn't that great  it's like you're  paying a top dollar  for a drink  and it was a thimble  me and Ben  were laughing  at the size  of the drink  it was about  an inch tall  yeah  ridiculous  and it was  they were what  I usually call  day strippers  that were at the bar  the other thing  the other thing 
[01:01:00]  with here  I've never smelled  a worse smell  ever  and I've gone to  a lot of drinking  establishments  it's called  vomit and diarrhea  ever  ever  me and Stinky  went to leave  after we were  done drinking  I was at the point  where I was just like  I need bed  immediately  they put us up  at the plush  Holiday Inn  last night  there are three of them  here in New Orleans  three Holiday Inns  I knew not which one  I knew not which one 
[01:01:30]  we stayed at  it turned out to be  the one by the Superdome  me and Stinky  decide we're going to  leave and walk  back to the hotel  we get a few blocks  away before we realize  hey do you even know  where the hotel is  Stinky goes  I think it's this way  we turn  which we later found  out the opposite  way we were supposed  to go  we were in Harlem  pretty much  we ended up in the  Harlem portion of New Orleans  oh that's not good  for an hour  the funniest thing was  I went to like  four places  I went to House of Blues 
[01:02:00]  all these places  I get home  I bang on  C's door  you guys weren't  even home yet  you guys got home  like an hour later  than me  we got so lost  in New Orleans  if you've ever been  just picture flying  to a city  and being dropped  in the middle of it  not knowing where  you are  or anything  and the cabs  are weird here  the lights are on  like they're ready  to serve you  you go to flag them  down and they just  drive past  I saw no one in the  car  we were getting  no help  we stop at one  Holiday Inn 
[01:02:30]  and they tell us  where the one  we're staying at is  and  dude we were like  a block away from it  five times  we looked at the map  this morning  during our  five minutes of  sobriety  that we had today  before I started  washing my hangover  away with getting  more vodka  and rum  and we  we screwed up  and Stinky  I will never  ever again  try to find my way  to a hotel with you  the guy's the worst  navigator  I should know too  when he's pot smoking  and he's drinking  yeah but the best thing 
[01:03:00]  about you guys is  one of you guys  called Tom  at like three in the morning  so Tom calls me  at nine this morning  he's like  I think one of you guys  was looking for some drugs  late night  enough with the drugs  Tom  we had Tom convinced  in the limo  that all of us  did drugs  that was the thing  he was so hammered  you ever see the guy  at a party  that's like  dude he's like  extreme like  party guy  so we were goofing  with him  and we told him  we were into  coke and pot  and heroin  and everything  and we're the straightest guy  I mean we don't

[01:07:30]  like it's 1981  Stinky had hashish  taped to his body  especially him  with the hair  he looks like  one of the Beatles  they're gonna search you  so  who got searched the most  you did  Norton  they took your coat off  they did a body  cavity search  and that was in the cab  on Hero Leak  and it was Tom doing it  the funniest thing  about the search is  I go through  they check me a little bit  Ope goes right through 
[01:08:00]  Norton  bags open  jacket off  feet up in the air  complete like  somebody that would  light his shoes on fire  and this awful woman  you look like somebody  and you're making  the thing go off  the tin foil  that your gum  comes wrapped in it  that keeps setting off  the metal detector  apparently it doesn't  detect explosives  in shoes  but it does pick up  my extra tin foil  I was a little  disappointed with  the Newark security  they didn't check  your shoes  they didn't do  the metal detector  all over your body 
[01:08:30]  which they do  at Kennedy and LaGuardia  very scary at Newark  you know what  the security was  nothing at Newark  do something  the only thing  I saw that was  different was the  guy carrying like  you know  a machine gun  or something  but besides that  but he was too busy  just you know  that's not like  one of the planes  from September 11th  came out of New  oh that's right  it did  that was good of you  guys to just announce  that that's where  the place they should go  why don't you just  fax Bin Laden  that was really good  to say over the air  oh he's listening  to the Ope and Anthony  show live from New Orleans

[01:56:30]  opened up a huge  wow banner  it had to be like  uh 10 by 15 feet  big black uh banner  with white spray paint  uh wow  opie and anthony  i never thought uh  we'd see as many fans  as we  we're seeing today  and they're all  uh they're from all  over the country  a lot of new yorkers  but uh philly representing  it seems like we have  quite an audience  down here in new orleans  i'm noticing as uh  as we we spend more  hours out here  the crowd's getting huge  stranger and drunker 
[01:57:00]  yeah  and i'm i'm getting  pelted every two seconds  now with beads  these asses  out of control  i think we got more  girls that we invited up  to the uh balcony  at this point  yeah  the show has become  just finding the hottest  girls on the street  bringing them up to the  balcony  yeah there really isn't  anything else  uh that's gonna go on  here  please  let's be realistic  they sent us into the  belly of the beast here  they gave us drinks  uh girls  i mean what the hell  are they expecting 
[01:57:30]  oh we thought the uh  the owner of the radio  station down there  down here knew what he  was doing  uh we were wrong  we knew that as soon as we  met him at the airport  tom's a madman  i've never met a guy that  runs a radio station that  gets dumped on him five  times and doesn't even see  a problem with it he's like  dude hope he's getting on my  case about swearing on my  tom  look at me being the  responsible one  what happened  it's the radio  you can't say the f word  when did i become such a  fag  the guy does it

[01:59:00]  more stuff is legal  or tolerated  here in new orleans  than it is anywhere  else in the country  because i have seen  more uh  sex acts  more uh  drugs  and uh  more uh  very bad use  of liquor  who would have  thought we would  have shocked  bourbon street  with our little  uh act earlier  in the show  yeah  we had the  homer girl  come here  and uh  she uh  supposedly did  some things  on the balcony  that she wasn't  supposed to do 
[01:59:30]  and the cops  came flying  from all directions  to make sure  everything was  kosher  we should have  kept that for now  so everything  is allowed here  yeah  that's what it  seems like  rape is allowed  if you follow it  up with an apology  oh there's your  water now  i swear i would  not drink  you're drinking it  you're insane  it's been out of  your sight  and what's stinky's  job down here  nothing  i have no idea  stinky's job is to  throw beads to the  crowd and go  yeah you gotta watch  out  the guys with wow

[02:00:30]  was that the  problem  the problem  was  i guess there's  some uh  some problem  here at  temptation  they were  going to let  extra girls in  or whatever  yeah  they're trying  to work out  the deal  so we can  get chicks  in here  but i had  nine hot  pizza glam  set up  wait there's  a really drunk  girl in a  tight red top  that uh  i do believe  is about to  start uh  showing some  uh  boobies  wow she is  so drunk  here it goes  look how drunk

[02:02:30]  fat women  that are willing  to show  yet the  hot ones  they're not  doing anything  it's funny  i mean that  girl  the fat lady  has no problem  just walking  right through  the crowd  the hot girls  it takes them  an hour to  walk a block  the fat girls  it takes them  two minutes  oh look  the blonde was  a ct and the  crowd is not  happy about that  wow look at that  i've noticed this  man if you're  you know a good  looking lady down  here yeah  and you don't  like start teasing  you know the guys  will leave you alone  but as soon as  you start teasing 
[02:03:00]  that you might  show something  then that's where  the problems begin  yeah then people  freak out  they want to see it  and then they get  mad if you don't  deliver on your  promise  god look at that  looks like we have  a lot of guys  that like our show  what is this about  it's all um  it's all guys  hoping  no i'm not  oh  nice shot  answer's got  at least i saw it  coming  i saw it coming  i turned my head  i think he was  insulted by what  we were saying  we like that  we like that guys  are listening to us 
[02:03:30]  but if you're down  here on bourbon  street you're hoping  to see some of the  ladies that listen  to us right  oh my god i just  got nailed in my head  you got clots  these people are  out of control  great place for a  child right there  huh  yeah this guy  who brings their  kid to mardi gras  this guy has uh  his child no more  than eight months  old on his back  in one of those  cabooses as he's  trying to make his  way through the crowd  and the kid's  drinking uh a hurricane  this is really  really frightening  this is why i love  this picardie girl  she hands me beads  and she goes  hit the baby

[02:04:30]  at this point  yeah this was  probably one of  the worst ideas  for a remote  we've ever done  yeah i think  next week we  could broadcast  maybe at a  crown heights  during the riots  that'd be nice  yeah because  there's nothing  it's completely  distracting the  crowd  yeah  uh  no one stops  giving you  uh booze  yeah  and then uh  you're just  waiting to see  cans  at this point  we could  announce the  cure for  cancer  and no one  will hear  no one will  care  no one will  care  i'm gonna  drop it on  the cameraman's  head  oh no the  sound guy 
[02:05:00]  watch watch  i'm amazed  by the guy  next one  i'm amazed  at how many  professional camera  crews are down  here just checking  out  checking in  checking out  the whole scene  they're waiting  to get the next  girls gone wild  video open  look at that  guy with the  wow stickers  there's so many  wow stickers  on the guy's  backs down  here  and the  place just  packing out  uh all i can  think is  that by the  time we're off  the air and no  one has to  tolerate this  program anymore  we are going  to uh probably  do 50 illegal 
[02:05:30]  things  yeah  that we could  not possibly  do right now  hey is the  homer girl  coming back  that would be  nice  i think the  homer girl is  coming back on  the show today  bring out on  the balcony and  uh give her  homer  also i can't  function like  this i'm  looking around  and it's  impossible  to do a  program  most of these  people don't  even know their  name  oh there you  go we got to  thank bacardi for  helping us out  with this party  today  bacardi  who are you  staring at  aunt  the girl just  showed her  cans right  there  which one  with the

[02:16:30]  how this show  has developed  if you guys were listening  when we first got on the air  it was very controlled  it was like  Ant and I  with three cute little stools  on the balcony  overlooking Bourbon Street  like we thought it was  going to stay that way  and there was like  you know  there was  there was a lot of people  on Bourbon Street  but it was controlled  there was maybe  a hundred people  in front of our balcony  having a good time  but in general  nothing was really happening  at this point  two and a half  three hours later  Anthony  we can't even move 
[02:17:00]  you're  you're  I don't know  a foot away from me  I can't hear you  unless they crank up  these headphones  we got some a-hole  with a  with a megaphone  just screaming in our ears  we're getting  pelted by bees  from all angles  we have to duck  underneath this railing  so we don't get killed  it's very hard  to do a program  as a matter of fact  we lost Jim Norton  at least an hour ago  he's got the hot chick  from Bacardi on his lap  he's always got it  like you have a chance  dude  like you have a chance  with the Whitney Houston girl  before Bobby Brown  got a hold of her 
[02:17:30]  would you have sex  with Jim Norton?  of course I would  she would  see there's something  about Norton  he's got this animal  magnetism  he's a nice boy  he seems like a nice boy  it's not animal magnetism  if they start to feel  sorry for me  and they just give in  is that it?  he's red hot  I'm red hot  he's red hot  it's that kind of connection  watch out for the chloroform  he'll get to it  that one  don't worry  don't worry lady  I'm only broadcasting  and she pushes me

[02:34:00]  normal again  Anthony  you know this  could only progress  into gunfire  which I hope so  I want to see that  I've never seen  a shooting  it's only  what time is it  New York time  it's very early  now  6.30 and this  crowd completely  out of control  now they're  you almost got  hit by that one  now they're fighting  I love drunk  fights  I will watch  it  the streets  more crowded  by the minute  when we first  got here  like we said  earlier  very calm  subdued

[02:41:30]  Oh.  They're saying they don't hear us.  Hey, hey, hey.  We're off.  We're off.  We're off. 
[02:42:00]  They're saying they don't hear us.  Thank you.  I don't know what you were talking about. 
[02:42:30]  I don't know what you were talking about, but I don't know what you were talking about. 
[02:43:00]  All right, this is great.  Turn down the goddamn music.  They say, Anthony, that we're on even though we're not going to be able to hear each other.  Oh, well.  That's what we're talking about.  But supposedly we're on now.  Ben, we're on?  Oh, great.  This is professional radio at its best.  Now we've got to be about two inches away so we can do a broadcast 
[02:43:30]  because we can't hear ourselves through the headphones.  It's louder than a jet engine around us.  Oh, well.  All right, we're back.  We're live.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show from Bourbon Street.  Thank God wrapping it up from Temptations Gentleman's Club in the heart of Mardi Gras.  You know what it is?  Me and Norton, during the commercial break,  we get such pleasure in hurting people with the beads.  Oh, it's great.  One guy, I aimed for his beer.  I hit him in the ear so hard, he actually went down to one knee. 
[02:44:00]  And then Norton went to knock a beer out of some woman's hand and hit her on the shoulder.  And she grabbed it and then did that look in her face that just said pain.  And I'm enjoying it.  I could do this all night.  Did you see me rope a leg?  I threw it and it actually landed over her neck around her shoulder.  Yeah, it went over her head like he roped her.  Hit her and heel her, cowboy.  There he goes again.  Just hit someone hard.  Oh, there's a little kid.  It's so tricky.  Hit the kid.  Hit the child.  Hit the kid. 
[02:44:30]  Baggot.  What a time that we're having.  You know, as far as doing a radio show for Mardi Gras, I doubt we'll do it again.  But I would love to come down here and not have to worry about doing a show.  I'll tell you that much.  Pete Johnson's working on it.  Yes, yes.  There was something that unpatched in New York, according to Pete Johnson.  And Pete is working on it.  And Pete's very disappointed.  I'm working diligently as soon as I fix the T2 pinball machine.  So that whole time when I'm thinking we're not on the air and I'm going, well, they're 
[02:45:00]  working on it.  They're sliding sliders.  Everyone's drunk around us.  No one has a clue.  That all went on the air.  I'm busy working.  I don't know what happened.  A bumper fell off the pinball machine.  I must fix that first.  Oh, there's one right there.  Who would think that the problem would be back in New York?  Ah, well.  You were thinking we'd have a problem with the broadcast.  It would be someone's fault here on the balcony.  You know, Opie, I would be very pissed if I thought we were doing a really good show 
[02:45:30]  today.  And it screwed up technically at the end.  But with the show we've done today and the music now playing in the background in my  head, I'm not worried about it.  The show had its moments, though.  I mean, we outraged Mardi Gras by having a girl do something that I guess has never been  done before on live radio in Mardi Gras.  Well, it happened hours ago.  So now we can say, yes, a hummer was given right here on the balcony.  And I thought the opening theme music was timed out well. 
[02:46:00]  I want to thank Stuff Magazine.  They helped us out today.  The Stuff Magazine girl is here, Anthony.  Yeah.  I love you guys.  Thank you so much.  Isn't she hot?  Am I hot?  You are so hot.  You guys are so sweet.  You're very hot.  And Tom's wife wants you.  I like Tom's wife.  She's a hottie.  I wish I'd like women.  I would love her.  But I like men a lot.  Tom and his wife are like trolling for everyone.  He thinks Rick is going to be in the hot tub watching Rick's wife. 
[02:46:30]  I don't even know what happened to Linda.  She's gone.  I don't even know where she is right now.  Your wife is gone?  Rick, your wife is gone?  I haven't seen her in about an hour.  That's not good at Mardi Gras.  She probably went back to the hotel room to hide.  No, I didn't check her in yet.  I don't know where she is.  All right.  I want to also thank Bacardi for keeping Jim preoccupied.  You would think that means that they were feeding Jim drinks.  No, they were just feeding Jim the Bacardi girls.  Women. 
[02:47:00]  And Tom.  The Bacardi girls.  Tom's babbling more.  Let's get Tom in here.  It's our last broadcast ever from New Orleans.  Yes, yes.  Ever.  Tom, how did this go?  You guys set a precedent here in New Orleans.  I think it was great myself.  Let me just tell you something.  That's something.  I used to work for the former Classic Rock.  Oh, my God.  He just cursed again.  Jesus.  He cursed again.  Tom, stop cursing.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[02:47:30]  But this is like...  What a dirty mouth in more ways than one.  Norton, I'm going to kick your ass.  But this is like nothing I've ever seen before.  Yes.  When the wild van drove down this street, and we're still waiting on the wild stickers to get printed, by the way.  And I've got three sponsors for them.  Right.  The wild stickers, Mr. Binkie's, Temptations, and Paul Needy Joe's.  Wow, wow, wow.  Okay.  Can we get back to the hospital?  And when the wild van drove down, it was just crazy.  I'm great.  How do you enjoy...  Unbelievable.  Tom, shut up.  Thank you.  How did you enjoy Norton's junk on your booty? 
[02:48:00]  It was red hot.  Now, you were sitting on Norton's lap, and then I thought I heard you say, you're poking me with something.  What was that?  We never actually discovered exactly what that was.  Yeah, yeah.  I said, do you feel it?  And she kept saying no, and I'm embarrassed because I'm white and I'm Irish.  It doesn't matter where we are.  I'm convinced we could be at a boys' camp and someone would be on your lap.  We should be so lucky.  Crinkle, crinkle. 
[02:48:30]  Hubba, hubba.  And thank you so much for these hurricanes.  Oh, they're fabulous.  Up here tonight, Utopia tonight.  Come out, get our Bacardi premiums.  We've got all kinds of goodies we're giving away.  We'll be at Razzous.  And the Big Bad Wolf tomorrow.  And all weekend, so definitely come out.  Oh, yeah.  Look for the ladies in Red Hot Red.  Don't hurt someone.  Hurt someone with us.  Hurt them.  Hurt them.  All right.  You just missed her drink. 
[02:49:00]  Hit it now.  She didn't even notice.  Norton, please, one more time.  Hit her.  Hit her.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Get it.  Damn.  Oh, you stink.  That was a nice college try.  Oh, Tom's bringing more pornography to throw out.  Thank you, Tom.  Yeah, grab those, I'll be.  Hey, who wants porno?  Hey, wow, there's a fat one again.  Who wants porno?  Here we go.  Just throwing porno to us.  Yeah, just throw smut. 
[02:49:30]  A crowd of animals.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, look at her showing.  Ooh, those are.  Find me a drink.  See, that's an example of.  Oh, look at this.  A double dong, Anthony.  Here you go.  Hey, you want a rubber schlong?  There you go.  All right, they caught the double dong.  This has to go to a lady.  Hey, someone get her.  Get the blonde.  How about some blue tape?  Hey, get the blonde.  Get the blonde.  The blonde, here you go.  You want this? 
[02:50:00]  You want this?  All right, she's.  Show me those cans.  She's going to show you something for the.  There she goes.  The apparatus.  You want that?  Yeah, you do, don't you?  She's teasing you, Ash.  She's teasing you.  God, I don't need to be teased.  Just show it.  Oh, would you stop pointing at Opie's ass, Tom?  I'm going to punch Tom.  She's doing a dance, Opie.  She's just ready.  Just show them.  There they go.  All right.  Very nice.  Let the girl get the schlong, okay? 
[02:50:30]  It's all right.  Oh, God, right in her face.  I love it.  I just hit her in the hazelnut slot.  Yeah, that definitely wasn't the first time.  It busted my balls so hard.  And you lean it over.  And your ass.  Crack your ass.  Your butt crack.  Opie, as you were leaning over the railing, Tom was looking at your ass crack through your  pants.  That's what we have to deal with down here.  Thanks, Tom.  Sure, my ass doesn't smell as bad as your mouth. 
[02:51:00]  He's right behind me.  I know.  They're screaming.  D.C.  Hey, D.C.  D.C.  I represent.  He's the guy.  The one D.C. listener is here.  Yes, Opie.  Listen, we've made it to the end, believe it or not.  We got the wrap-up signal.  Thank God.  Wow.  Naughty 90 contest officially over.  Monday, we start the voting, Anthony.  Right.  We'll be back to normal in New York City on Monday at 3.  Yeah.  Thanks for checking us out.  We will have pictures and video of this mess on foundrymusic.com. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, yeah.  And opianthony.com.  But it's going to take a while because they didn't have an internet hookup for us here.  So sometime on Monday or early Tuesday, we'll have all the footage of what we saw.  All right.  Let's hear from the crowd.  My hand just hit Tom.  Dude, they don't even know which.  Oh, there they go.  Yeah.  O&A, live, Mardi Gras, Bourbon Street.  And we'll see you Monday.  Monday.  Thank you, Tom.  We're off the air. 
[02:52:00]  Thank you, guys.  Man, we love you.  Extreme Radio 94.9, we rule.  We rule the world of unlimited halibut.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  All right, Tom.  Thank you. </pre>
