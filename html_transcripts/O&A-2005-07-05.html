<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, along with Jimmy and Martini Steve, recounting a shopping trip to a Lush store in Georgetown, filled with humorous descriptions of the overwhelming scents and Jimmy's enthusiastic purchasing.  The conversation was punctuated with crude and sexually suggestive remarks. They then discussed a dinner at a Georgetown restaurant frequented by Bill Clinton, where they mistakenly believed they saw the German Chancellor.  The show transitioned to a graphic discussion of a runaway bride's police report detailing a fantastical abduction and forced sexual encounter.  The hosts provided explicit commentary and jokes.  A segment on a "Little Marky" record about an alcoholic father followed, featuring humorous but dark descriptions of the father’s behavior and family struggles, bookended by more sexually charged banter and a caller's anecdote.  The show then featured a rambling, highly profane story about a dysfunctional family, including a graphic, offensive anecdote about a father's violent abuse of his wife and son, culminating in the son's death.

The hosts then discussed their attempts at Spanish-language prank calls, playing both the original English and poorly translated Spanish versions.  This was followed by a series of short segments: a discussion about technical difficulties; a story about pranking a neighbor using a police scanner; a discussion of a friend's gay-themed party boat and a gay pride cruise; and a visit from Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine.  Richard Cheese performed a song with explicit lyrics, and the conversation included discussion of the band, their album, and future plans. Ben Bailey also joined the conversation.  Richard Cheese’s segment extensively covered his frustrations with past band members, his dislike of Paul Anka's "Rock Swings" album (with audio clips of Anka yelling at his band played and discussed),  and a discussion about the song "Shit Dick" from Panzerfaust Records,  including a reading of its homophobic lyrics.  He also discussed negative experiences with Oleo Records and the dual nature of DickCheese.com.  Richard Cheese performed another song before leaving.

The show then featured a studio appearance by Stephen Lynch, repeatedly referred to as a drunk, who debuted new songs including "Nazi" and one about Satan, along with comedic mispronunciations and rambling.  A pre-recorded phone interview with Arun Sheik, described as the World Wrestling Federation champion, provided comedic moments due to his accented English.  The hosts reminisced about their previous afternoon show, their alcohol consumption, and having shot girls in the studio.  They discussed Jimmy Norton's recent appearance on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*, playing audio clips and analyzing his jokes and interactions with Leno and Hilary Duff,  with calls from listeners expressing various opinions on Norton's performance and the show.  The possibility of Rich Voss replacing Norton was also discussed.


A later segment focused on Jimmy Norton's *Tonight Show* appearance, detailing his pre-show nerves, unplanned Hilary Duff anecdote, and interactions with Jay Leno, including a discussion of farting near Hilary Duff and Leno.  A phone call with comedian Dom Marrera followed, covering amateur porn, his experiences at "Bananas" comedy club, a Comedy Central "top 100 comics" list, his friend Brother Wee's cancer battle, and anecdotes about other comedians.  The hosts concluded the broadcast with Anthony expressing anxiety over a home invasion news report, leading to a humorous discussion about self-defense, featuring jokes about guns, panic rooms, and Anthony wielding a rapier.  A caller shared their story about confronting burglars, and the segment ended with audio bits about murder. The hosts briefly discussed their move to XM Satellite Radio and their departure from afternoon radio.

A segment featuring a nostalgic discussion of 1970s Quinn Martin detective shows, including *Kojak*, *Mannix*, *Cannon*, *McMillan & Wife*, and *Barnaby Jones*, followed, using humorous and crude descriptions.  This transitioned into a discussion of the Robert Blake murder trial and Larry King's interview with Michael Jackson's lawyer, with the hosts criticizing King's questioning.  A gay caller, Kyler, expressed offense at the hosts' use of homophobic slurs, leading to a discussion where the hosts defended their comedic style and targeted demographic. Further calls followed, with some supporting and others criticizing the hosts.  The segment concluded with celebrity gossip about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.

Finally, the show analyzed Google search frequencies of celebrities, comparing Brad Pitt's millions to the hosts' and others'.  The hosts discussed Brad Pitt's divorce from Jennifer Aniston and his relationship with Angelina Jolie, using crude and sexually explicit jokes.  A brief phone call with Jessica Alba was mentioned, followed by a vulgar, sexually explicit song/spoken word piece about masturbating boys. The broadcast ended with a promotional announcement for XM radio and their website.

[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  It's absolutely awful.  What's up, Anthony?  Hi.  We have to hit the road a lot on this program.  We have to go down to Washington like once a month to do our show so we could feel connected  to the XM crew down there in Washington and at the Washington compound. 
[00:04:30]  And, you know, you do your show.  You're bored.  So you find things to do.  And one day, the boys, except for Anthony.  No, you faggots went shopping.  Decided to go to Georgetown and take in the sights and sounds of Georgetown.  And I want to make it perfectly clear we looked at a lot of hot women.  Did I say that we looked at a lot of hot women?  Yes.  I want to make it perfectly clear.  Yeah.  A lot of fine ass walking around this particular day. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I'm trying to take the gay out of the bit you're about to hear, but I'm sure it's not going to  help whatsoever.  Yeah.  So we went shopping in Georgetown and we discovered a shop called Lush.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they aren't stinking.  Oh, who took their shoes off?  It's a little stinky in here.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  There's a bunch of things I want to get to right off the bat.  I was trying to remember.  You were saying something about that thing.  Oh, there was, well, our little evenings last night. 
[00:05:30]  Well, I guess we could start with that.  Sure.  You guys went out.  Well, we went to Georgetown and we ate at a fine Italian restaurant.  You did?  We knew it was going to be a good restaurant because right at the front door is a picture  of Bill Clinton and Hillary.  Oh, really?  That's where they went for Valentine's Day.  Both of them?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were.  Like there's any romance in that marriage that they need to go out for Valentine's Day.  I guess it's his favorite restaurant here in Washington, D.C. in the Georgetown area. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, a fine Italian joint.  We had a really good meal.  Yeah.  We're hanging out and all of a sudden the Chancellor of Germany walks in and the whole place stands  up and applauds.  Really?  That was a little weird.  Yeah, except for us.  We had no idea who he was.  He looked like the fat guy from Lethal Leppin 2.  The South African guy.  Right, yeah.  That's exactly what he looked like.  Really?  We were just assuming he was the Chancellor of Germany because our waiter was telling us  that there's a special VIP area where, because we asked, you know. 
[00:06:30]  So why did you pick the Chancellor of Germany for him to be?  Because they said that the Chancellor of Germany is here tonight.  Yeah, they said that he's here tonight.  Yeah.  But maybe he was already here and this was another guy going to this VIP area.  Because we asked, we're like, where does Bill go when he comes to this restaurant?  Because he can't just sit out there with everybody.  All the schmucks like Russ.  Ruff Ruff.  So there's like this back room right next to the kitchen that they go into, I guess.  Ah.  Yeah, so we're sitting there and also this big, just enormous.  He looked like a raging alcoholic, to be honest with you. 
[00:07:00]  He looks like he's been to a few Oktoberfests in his day.  All those Europeans are anyway.  And then his security looked like we could have taken him.  He's a little weird guy with pistol balls in his right.  Really?  Yeah, we were studying his bolts, trying to figure out what kind of weapon he had.  And he gave us the up and down, like, don't even think about it.  I talked to the Chancellor, I said hello, and he went, Kaffer lover.  I pardon you.  There's a ring around a restaurant. 
[00:07:30]  So we had dinner and then it was Lindsay and I, it was Jimmy, it was Derek,  it was Martini Steve, and we all started shopping.  Shopping.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shopping.  Now, what could you shop for?  Well, Georgetown's awesome.  It's a lot of fun.  There's, you know, there's martini bars, there's nice restaurants.  Ooh, martini bars.  There's great shopping, there's Abercrombie and Fitch and The Gap and, I mean, you name it, 
[00:08:00]  they have it there.  Yeah, whatever you want, man.  Nice shirts and clothes and soap and shoes.  He's like, whatever you want to buy, there's plenty out there.  Yeah, why don't you back up?  No Rodeo Drive.  Exactly.  And you missed the key word there.  Yeah.  He's trying to get past this.  Soap.  What?  Soap.  I like soap.  What's the name of the store we went into?  I don't know.  Lush.  Lush.  What?  Wait, wait, wait.  Stop it. 
[00:08:30]  How would you even go into a store named Lush?  Lush.  We're walking by the store and the loveliest scent hit me.  I was hit by a lovely scent.  Oh.  Jimmy loves to shop.  He loves stuff like Pottery Barn and Bed Bath and Beyond.  He likes these, like, kind of girly stores.  Yeah.  They have a word for guys like that.  Pack it.  His whole demeanor changes, though. 
[00:09:00]  We're walking by this store called Lush.  Did he go, ooh?  That would have been more masculine.  It really would have been.  And all of a sudden, he, I don't know, I guess you smelled the fragrances coming from the store?  It was.  An ensemble of fragrances.  Because we're on the sidewalk, the doors are open, and all of a sudden Jimmy goes, ooh, or whatever.  And he just runs into the store.  A cornucopia of scents. 
[00:09:30]  So we walk into Lush, and Jimmy is just beyond excited.  Yeah.  He wants to know about all the soaps.  Ah.  The place has got these handmade soaps, okay?  And it's, it's like, they look like just chunks of, like, clay.  But they're just, they're.  You know what it is?  It's like cheese blocks.  Exactly what they look like, cheese blocks.  Like big cheese block-looking things of soap.  Yeah.  And then you smell one, and then you go, oh, I like that.  And then they.  Each one tickling the olfactory.  And they cut off a piece of the soap for you. 
[00:10:00]  They cut it off and wrap it up all night.  Oh, look, he's got his soap.  This is, this here is called Bohemian Soap.  Specially crafted with luscious lemons to get you squeaky clean.  Oh.  Hey, Martini Steve.  It works great for getting male jizz out of your ass crack.  It would, it would have been more masculine to wash my face with a cock.  So, you know, there's a lot of people.  We're all hanging out. 
[00:10:30]  Here comes Martini Steve with his bag.  He's got his lunch bag.  Oh, you bunch of fruits.  I'm not gay, but I like to be lemony fresh.  Oh.  I didn't feel that.  I got that.  Hold on, hold on.  I don't know.  Is it?  Yeah, it's here.  Oh, my.  Hold on.  Let me explain, though.  Because, yeah, there, Martini Steve has walked in with his bag from Lush.  Oh, they still smell.  So, Jimmy's running around this joint thing.  It's the coolest thing he's ever seen.  They have stuff like bath bombs. 
[00:11:00]  Bath bombs?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's like the size of a softball, and I guess you drop it in your bath water, and it's like  an Alka-Seltzer tablet.  Oh, and you get a little bubbling action there.  Wow.  Lavender.  All the scents you'd want for bath bombs.  Of course.  Then they have, like, face soaps with actual seaweed in them.  Really?  And they have soap for every type of skin problem that you might have.  Oh, dry skin or oily.  So, Jimmy, there's mostly women in this place, you know, working there and shopping there, 
[00:11:30]  and Jimmy just kind of takes over the whole joint.  He's got two or three people working for him.  You're asking questions.  All sorts of questions.  Asking your soap questions.  What's good for this?  What's good for your pores?  Yeah, because I want to get a facial.  I've never gotten one.  You've got a facial, all right?  No, not that kind of facial.  Not the fun kind.  Hey, Bobby Bigrigger is very confused on the phones.  He says he likes urine and soap. 
[00:12:00]  Both very, in a weird way, cleansing.  You know, if you want to tease my tinkle enjoyment, that cleanses things, I think.  Uh-huh.  So, he's running around all excited, and we're all just kind of standing around taking a slight  interest, Anthony.  Like, oh, that's a little interesting.  Oh, yeah, whatever, you know.  So, next thing you know, we're all shopping.  You're all sucked into this whole thing.  He sucked us all in.  Picking up, this one is very good.  This is my favorite.  It's the Demon in the Dark soap.  It's called Demon in the Dark.  Of course it is. 
[00:12:30]  It has a lovely, like, mint flavor scent, and it says, peel the wax, lather, and wait for  your dark side to appear.  Oh.  Ooh, saucy.  This really is the type of soap you should be using on yourself as you open your robe while  you stand there in the doorway thanking your friends for visiting again.  They have gentle on your sarcoma.  Wow.  Yeah, they have soap that looks like brownies and all sorts of crap, Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  It was quite amazing, and this bastard sucked us all in.  It's a great place, though.  You can't not buy soap when you're there.  You have to.  They're all different shapes and sizes.  Anthony, ready?  Jimmy, how much did you spend on your soap yesterday?  A few dollars, I think.  How much?  A few bucks.  This bar was $11 for this bar.  $11 for that?  Well, you have to realize, this is sandstone soap.  Follow the Brazilians and keep your body smooth with sand soap.  Yours only cost $11?  Yeah, well, what kind of a hunk did you get? 
[00:13:30]  I got this for $16.  I didn't even know.  That is a $16 bar of soap.  Yeah, they win.  They win.  Yeah, is that what they do?  Of course.  You've got to be shitting me.  I'm paying for it.  You'll lather with it.  Oh, you got the same one, Steve.  Yeah, yeah.  I sensed you.  Jesus.  I was told not to get the sandstone soap.  By who?  It's exfoliating, I bet.  Well, I was looking for one of those soaps for my face, and you don't want the sandstone.  It'll just rip you apart.  That's for your feet, Anthony.  You know how it gets all calloused in the middle of summer? 
[00:14:00]  What's that?  You've got that rough skin, and it's all peely.  So you use that on the bottom of your feet.  Rockstar soap?  Is that what that's for?  For your feet?  No, this is the sandstone soap.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Don't use that on your face.  I'm going to.  No, they said not to use that on your face.  Maybe gently.  Good.  Slow, circular motions with just your fingertips.  Dude, it's actual sand.  Fruit.  It's actual sand.  Dude, look at this dispenser.  It has a helmet on it, and you squeeze the bottom two things. 
[00:14:30]  But it says, aim for back.  But Jimmy's the worst.  He's the worst.  Because he sucks everybody in.  Yeah.  And then next thing you know, everyone's pulling out their credit cards, walking out of the  store with their little Lush bag.  The Lush bag.  You can't help it.  It was just fun stuff.  And then we're walking around Georgetown trying to look cool, and you can't look cool with  a Lush bag.  No, you can't.  Very difficult.  Is that the receipt, Jimmy?  Yeah.  How much total?  Actually, it's not the whole receipt, actually.  It's something else.  What was the total that you spent on soap last night? 
[00:15:00]  I don't know.  Wait.  No.  The bottom number, Jim.  No, but you see there's a bunch of numbers.  I spent...  It's more than that.  Yeah, no, he's...  I know about how much he spent.  Not that much.  Less than $4.  No.  No, you couldn't have gotten out of there for less than $40.  I got a few of these.  This cold face was $12.46 for this little bar.  What does that do?  Black soap for clear skin with charcoal, licorice, and soothing oils.  I got one of those, too, Anthony. 
[00:15:30]  Of course you did.  I got one of those, and then I got some body wash, some shower gel, a lemon-lime mixture,  and some kind of mint mixture.  These are just good.  You feel like you're just standing there with a bar of quarry soap, just washing your...  It has a heavy weight to them, man.  What's wrong with, I don't know, ivory?  Nothing.  A bar of ivory in your shower, and...  Steve, what other soaps did you buy?  I got...  I just got...  Ivory is good for common people, and those little people that like that, that's fine, 
[00:16:00]  but, again, I'm a fancy person.  Soap diva.  This is what happens when you hit the road, though.  You get bored, and you start doing things.  You would never do it at home.  Shopping for soap.  I would never go shopping for soap in New York City.  And, in record respect, I have a piece of the sandstone that Jimmy got, and then I got  rock star soap, which is...  It's not as overwhelming.  The one thing you realize is when you walk into these places, the smells are so overpowering.  You get pulled in different directions, and you don't really know which one. 
[00:16:30]  Good point, Steve.  And you just...  I went for the least offending one of the...  Of the group.  This was like candy or gum or something.  It does.  Like a rock star.  That's all you got, Steve?  No, that was it.  Yeah, but these two pieces of soap cost 24 bucks.  Yeah.  I mean, that's a lot of...  It must have been late.  I guess the cock store was closed.  Oh, yeah.  Figured you'd just...  I don't know what time that closes, but...  It's, uh...  I know I spent about, uh, $60 in there. 
[00:17:00]  $60?  $60?  On soap?  On soap.  Wow.  It's not just soap.  It's not.  It's a fun showering and bathing experience.  I should have bought a bathing...  A ball bomb.  Bathing bomb.  A bath bomb.  Yeah, bath bomb.  Yeah.  Are you going to, uh...  Are you going to, like, maybe display these in a basket in your new bathroom?  No, no.  They don't.  They look like...  You said, like, a cheese...  It's like big hunks of, like, cheese.  So, no, I'll just use them.  You could just use them.  You could kill somebody with this, uh, soap.  Yeah, they seem very... 
[00:17:30]  It's very heavy.  It's very brick-like.  Yeah, very chalky-looking softball-type thing.  And what do you say?  Give me two pounds of that and...  No, they're in, like, like, imagine, like, a fruit basket, like, arrangement, but it was...  Good analogy.  Yeah, I can imagine that.  Like, like, like a fruit stand, but instead of fruits, there's soaps.  Just imagine a basket filled with a drug cocktail.  How awful is this, Anthony?  Oh, it's horrid.  But he sucked us all in, because at first, we're just standing around, like, oh, God, 
[00:18:00]  how long is he going to be in there?  And we're actually out on the sidewalk, kind of checking out the sights and stuff, and slowly  but shortly, we all started walking in.  We all started walking in and purchasing your soaps.  You can't help it.  It's phenomenal.  The bath balls were great.  I'm moving into this place next week, and my tub is really deep.  I should have got a bath ball, so I could have taken a nice lavender bath.  Lavender, bubbly bath, but I didn't.  Yeah, no, you should have.  What else did you buy, Jimmy?  That was it?  That was just, I think most of the soaps is all I got, and they gave me a couple of  samples, like, you know, little creams and such. 
[00:18:30]  Weren't you going to buy the face soap cream crap that has the seaweed, the actual seaweed?  Yeah, I actually got talked out of that, because it smelled bad.  Yeah, it had, like, actual seaweed in it.  And a seaweed would probably smell bad.  Yeah, I decided not to get that.  I traded in it for some sandstone.  It's called Lady's Snatch.  Let's go to Sea Bass.  Sea Bass!  How you doing, fellas?  Hey.  Hi, Sea Bass.  I want to know if the Lush Bag has a picture of two fellas lathering each other up on it. 
[00:19:00]  Lathering each other up.  You're not dying, sonny.  You're soaping everyone around you.  Let's say hi to Rob.  What's up, Rob?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Just want to know why Steve didn't get the flaming soap.  Is there flaming soap?  I didn't see any.  If there was, I missed it.  That would have been a coup.  Steve bought soap.  It smells like an olive.  Let's go to Tim in Jersey.  Hey, Tim.  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, Sugar.  Hi.  Hi, mister. 
[00:19:30]  Hey, Jimmy.  Did you ask the girls when they were helping you around if they had any soaps that were designed  to help remove the scent of logs from the chest?  No, sir.  I kind of kept that under my hat.  I just asked.  I kind of hinted around.  I have a son, and his diapers are always full.  Is this good?  Let's see what's...  Can I soap up your ass?  Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep Jeep 
[00:20:00]  belly, and you rub and go, como, como, washo, como, como, como, why is it only Jimmy and 
[00:20:30]  Steve?  Opie bought $60 right for sale.  She certainly did.  Because it's the Brazilian soap.  Opie didn't get that?  No, I went with the shower gel.  I guess that was the expensive.  I don't know.  Shower gel?  Yeah.  What else did you get?  It was a lemon-lime shower gel.  Ooh.  Some kind of mint shower gel.  Minty fresh.  And that black soap.  Oh, that's the coal stuff for the face.  Coal.  Yeah, it's a coal soap for exfoliation.  Did they come out singing Mammy? 
[00:21:00]  Black coal soap for your face?  Yeah.  And then they had, like, soap shampoo.  What the hell was that about?  Oh, these were actually lovely.  I was going to buy one.  Lovely.  Dude, our show should never be using the word lovely.  Lovely.  Yeah, these things were cool, man.  And these soaps fucking reminded me of tits, you know?  Yeah, that's it.  Big soap tits.  I wanted to buy these ones, but I didn't.  They were shampooed.  They looked like those little round, again, like smaller cheese things, but these were 
[00:21:30]  whole circles.  Like a picture of a donut.  A whole, you know, solid donut.  Right.  And they smelled great, but they were shampooed.  And I guess you would just rub them into your hair.  Rub it into your hair like a...  Yeah, like a little hair bar.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  That is lovely.  Yeah, it is.  Nice shampooing experience, but I don't really need that, so I didn't buy it.  And we all walked out with our lush bags.  We sure did.  A bunch of men just walking, smelling good.  With your lush bags.  Yeah.  Thumbs up on other people.  Did you shop anywhere else, or that was your only shopping experience? 
[00:22:00]  I ran at the Pottery Barn quickly.  I wanted to get a...  Dude, I wanted to...  I'm sorry.  I wanted to use some of my new soap last night, but they don't sell soap dishes in this place  you can travel with, so I am not going to use...  Oh, jeez.  A traveling soap dish.  Well, you know, like the one that you take your block of soap in.  There's no way to wash, and then put your wet soap back in your bag.  It's going to get stuff all over.  So you would want a little case, perhaps like Howard Hughes used in the Aviator?  I almost got that last night, but I didn't, by the way.  Howard Hughes opens it up every time he goes into the bathroom, Howard Hughes would open 
[00:22:30]  up this little silver case and pull his soap out and just wash until his hands bled.  Would he really?  Yeah.  Pop it back in and hold his breath when people with polio pass by him so he wouldn't breathe  in the air that they were giving off.  Are we talking about Howard Hughes or me?  Yeah, or you, Anthony.  Well, yeah, a little crazy like that.  Howard Hughes would close that thing up and put it back in the glove compartment of his Escalade.  Exactly.  You can't be too careful.  And I don't think you can wash your hands to the point of making them bleed, by the way. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I think you can.  How?  You just wash them and wash them.  All the oils wash away.  They crack.  Yeah?  Yeah, I've heard of that.  You've heard of that, Anthony?  I've heard of that.  All right, let's go to Don.  I never saw it.  Look, my hand is very smooth.  Let's go to Don in Connecticut.  You've got money all your life.  You've got city hands, Mr. Hooper.  Buy me a sheep shank.  Get that lush soap.  Going to need a bigger soap bag.  Let's drink to your sandstone. 
[00:23:30]  So, I need a soap dish once.  Swallowed it whole.  Eyes rolled back white.  Bubble coming out of his mouth.  I'll never go into lush again.  Hey, let's go to Don in Connecticut.  Hey, Don.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  This is horrible.  You know, you guys, Anthony, you've got to fill up the pillowcase and just beat these guys with it.  There you go. 
[00:24:00]  Ow!  Ow!  It's just funny how it goes down, though, because it always starts with Jim, and you'll...  Oh, that smells good.  Yeah.  Remember, Fat Boy?  It's just a beautiful...  I was trying to say beautiful and odoriferous in the same sentence.  That's a tough one to pull off.  Oh, for Pete's sake.  Ow!  Ow!  That's lovely!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  That's the problem with going on the road, though. 
[00:24:30]  You find these little things to occupy your time and entertain yourself, I guess.  Yeah.  Because every city has the same stores.  The Gap and, you know, Abercrombie and Pitch and...  Faggy stores.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  And then you see an unusual store like this, and you have to take a peek, because you're kind  of bored out there, and the next thing you know, you're spending a lot of money.  I don't even think I'll use the stuff I bought.  Someone is asking if you took a sliver off the big block named Shit Dick.  Dude, I remember one time I was in Baltimore, and I was doing the Baltimore Improv, and I 
[00:25:00]  actually went shopping one day in Baltimore, and I was bored, so I went to Evita, because  the hotel had Evita in it, and I had never smelled that kind of stuff.  Oh, Evita.  Yeah.  And what do they sell?  The same type of lovely, you know, like little shampoos and little things for your hands.  Soaps and lotions.  Lotions.  I spent almost $200 in Evita.  Oh, my goodness.  And it sat in a bag on my counter for a year and a half.  I never used it.  A year and a half.  I'm compulsive.  I don't shop to the point of spending thousands of dollars. 
[00:25:30]  They're like, I'll go out and just do something stupid like that, and then just never use  it and go, you really are a faggot.  And I don't, you know.  I can see you using your soaps, though.  Yeah.  Why not?  I'm hyacinic.  Then we went to Barnes & Noble, and we're all buying books, relatively normal books.  Yeah.  No big deal.  I bought the latest book from the Fight Club author.  I can never say his last name.  Uh-huh.  Was this one, what, 30, 35 pages?  Fight Club was a little thin.  Oh, no, no, it's longer than that. 
[00:26:00]  And Jimmy finally goes to the checkout counter with his chess books.  Oh.  I bought a couple, yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Intellectual.  Chess problems, and then one about chess players, and then Confederacy Dunces.  I just wanted to buy some books.  I know, but the chess books, I was just browsing through really fast while he was online.  I'm like, you're actually going to read this stuff?  I love them.  I'm weird with chess books.  I'll buy a bunch of them, and I know I'll never really go through them.  Yeah.  They're great in the toilet, and they're just kind of like, when I can finally break away  from my stupid computer, my porn sites, I can actually just play out the moves from 
[00:26:30]  the book, which I like doing.  Yeah.  You just sit there reading.  Oh, chess.  But they're actual chess problems, and then you've got to what?  Try to solve what's happening?  And I'll probably solve one out of 50.  Oh, he canceled here.  Makes perfect sense.  As opposed to going out and banging a girl.  I could just picture him in a lathery bathtub with candles.  Oh, candles all lit around him.  And then reading his chess problems.  Holding his chess book out of the water.  Yes.  That's fantastic. 
[00:27:00]  That's right.  Just playing a little chess and bad-mouthing the Jews.  Like, you know, Bobby F.  That's sociopath.  Bobby F.  Yeah, I see Fisher interviewed him because Iceland, they finally gave him some kind of a place  to live now, they gave him citizenship in Iceland, and he's just, he's had a press  conversation recently, he's like, you know, the freaking Jews, man, he's hate.  Oh, yeah, he really does not like the Jews.  And he's half Jewish.  Yeah.  His mother's Jewish.  God, but it was very interesting in Georgetown last night, Anthony.  It was fun.

He's taking his smoothie dump.  Are you forcing, Jimmy? 
[00:30:30]  Dude, I'm just trying to relax.  I haven't dumped much in the last couple of days because I'm a house guest.  But you can bet that smoothie hit my system and it is all coming.

Discussing bride's fake story about being abducted by a Mexican man and a white woman. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  Remember the runaway bride?  The bug-eyed, howl-eyed looking lady there?  Bug-eyed bride.  Bug-eyed bride.  This is our discussion on that whole thing.  Jimmy, how are you doing?  What the hell was that?  Oh, my God.  He's pissing out his ass.  He's at the pissing out his ass phase.  Are you having explosive diarrhea?  No, I was actually tinkling. 
[00:31:30]  I'm holding the phone by my helmet.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were having one of those moments where you actually piss out your ass.  No, I was starting to cramp during the show.  So I'm really happy I'm in here right now.  Here's Opie and Anthony when they don't suck.  Good for what ails you, what what?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Have you heard the steamy, seedy description of the runaway bride's sexual encounter?  No.  With the Hispanic man and woman that abducted her? 
[00:32:00]  This is from her story.  It's pretty steamy.  What happened there?  Well, let's see.  They talk about how she was jogging out on the evening of April 26th.  She was grabbed by two individuals, a Hispanic male and white female.  This is from the police report, obviously.  In a van and thrown in the back of it.  Her hands were then tied with rope.  The individuals placed her on her right side on the floor of the van and made her face the back door. 
[00:32:30]  The male then began driving while the female stayed in the back of the van with Jennifer.  After approximately 30 minutes, the male pulled the van off the side of the road and shut the vehicle off.  She's all tied up and wondering what, why are we stopping?  Can I jump in really fast?  Sure.  This obviously is her fantasy that she really wants to happen to her.  Absolutely.  This girl is so horny.  So horned up that the fantasy of an abduction has to include this little sexual thing that happened. 
[00:33:00]  Go ahead, Ant.  Off the side of the road, the vehicle gets shut off.  The female took off her pants and underwear but left her shirt on.  The female then pulled down Jennifer's pants and underwear, performed oral sex on her, and digitally penetrated her vagina.  So this couple abducts you and licks your pussy.  This chick rocks.  The girl takes her clothes off and starts going down on you. 
[00:33:30]  Dude, this reminds me when I was a kid.  I had a bad thing.  I was actually walking and this girl with a really meaty vagina pulled over and made me get in the car  and jerk off looking at her and listening to Ozzy.  Right.  It was horrible.  And then let you off somewhere.  This doesn't happen.  How about stabbed her in the chest a few times and shit on her face?  Ooh.  I'm going to take the band with the good.  Is there more?  Of course.  Oh, good.  Pulled down and panted and underwear, performed oral sex on her, and digitally penetrated her vagina. 
[00:34:00]  The female then moved over Jennifer's head and told her to perform oral sex on her.  At the same time, the male had gone to the back of the van.  He then removed his pants and placed his penis into Jennifer's vagina.  According to Jennifer, she performed oral sex on the female until the female had an orgasm.  The male pulled his penis out from Jennifer's vagina once the female had an orgasm.  Jennifer was not sure if the male had ejaculated. 
[00:34:30]  The female and male then dressed themselves and pulled up Jennifer's underwear and pants.  The male then moved to the front of the van and began driving again.  One of the sergeants asked Jennifer if prior to the van stopping, did the male or female make any comments?  Jennifer said they only spoke in Spanish.  Now, this is the investigator trying to trip her story up a little bit.  The sergeant also asked Jennifer if it was dark or lit in the area they had stopped during the sexual assault. 
[00:35:00]  She replied it was dark.  He then asked, if it was dark, how was she able to see the female and male removing their clothing?  Jennifer stated when she was...  Well, look at those eyes of hers.  She sees in the dark, of course.  Of course she does, man.  Those eyes are adapted for the dark.  If only she thought of that.  She didn't say that.  Look at my eye, you idiot.  Look at my eye, you idiot.  Turn the lights out in here and hold up some fingers.  These pupils don't move. 
[00:35:30]  The investigator kept asking her questions.  She kept going, who?  He went, you.  What do you mean all you did was eat wise potato chips?  What are you talking about, miss?  I can't answer that, but I can tell you how many licks it takes to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop.  What exactly did the female...  Let me see.  Jennifer stated...  I lost my spot.  Where was it?  That's all right, Ann.  Take your time.  Wait a minute.  Because I still got the nice visual in my head of what she wants done to her. 
[00:36:00]  I guarantee you this is what she did in Vegas with this couple.  Because she did hang out with a Spanish couple in Vegas.  Dark or light.  Okay.  Jennifer stated, when she was told by the female to perform sex on her, the female placed her vagina over her face.  She could tell the female was only wearing a shirt.  Because I guess the shirt kind of...  Was hitting her in the head.  Was hitting her in the face.  A little bit.  Sexy.  As she was licking her pussy in this fantasy this woman had.  God, this guy better marry this broad. 
[00:36:30]  Sergeant...  He's got a lot of fun ahead of him.  The sergeant asked Jennifer, what exactly did the female state to you when she wanted you to perform oral sex?  Jennifer said the female told her, now you can lick my pussy.  The sergeant asked if the male or female made any statements to her while the sexual assault was taking place.  She said, no.  The sergeant asked Jennifer if the male was wearing a condom when he penetrated her.  Jennifer replied, she did not know. 
[00:37:00]  Would girls know that or not?  Not necessarily.  Feel a condom?  Let's hope not because I've been pulling it off for quite a few years.  Yeah, yeah.  It's on.  It's on.  Sergeant asked Jennifer if she was bound by rope during the entire sexual assault.  Jennifer said, yes.  And the detective asked if Jennifer had penetrated her with any force.  Jennifer said the male did not use any force, but he did not use any foreplay either.  I asked her if she was sexually assaulted at any other time throughout the incident. 
[00:37:30]  She stated, no.  After the sexual assault, they began driving again.  She told them she remained lying down and did not sit up.  And then she, they stopped numerous times to get gas and junk food.  She was dropped off in Albuquerque where she made the 911 call.  So that's her little sexual fantasy.  That's the police report.  That rocks.  She told the cops.  And the cops asking her those questions must have just known she was lying.  But the fact that the girl is sitting on her face, that turns me on.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  I got like half a rod going.  That's really hot, man.  I like how it didn't include anything really bad, though.  Like, the guy might have been wearing a condom.  Didn't seem like he even came.  He was just, like, having sex with her until the girl came.  The girl that was sitting on her face.  She's so good at oral sex that she made her cum.  And this kook is...  And then the guy just stopped.  This kook is going to marry this religious nut.  Because now I think he's nutty, too.  How about plowing it into her ass until it bleeds?  How about that?  Now, that's a rape.  That's not her fantasy, Anthony. 
[00:38:30]  That's not her fantasy.  He's into the threesome.  Why didn't he put his uncut gift into her face when he was finished?  Right.  The husband-to-be had to read this police report.  He must have been out of his mind.  We'll pray together and hopefully get through this with prayer.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  Pray together.  What you need to do is get another chick to squat on her face.  She's probably already licked some box in the loony bin.  She's been in a shower with another nut.  Room handles.  And they're scrubbing each other's faces. 
[00:39:00]  One of them kneels on some flip-flops.  We heard they do that.  Yeah, we have.  Oh, the story just gets better and better.  Pretty hot.  That's off the smoke.  You know, the religious family had to read the police report going, oh, my God.  They had to read everything.  Are you kidding me?  They had to read everything.  We thought our son found the perfect woman.  They don't want this woman now.  And now we're going to have to deal with this.  Just the fact that she had the ability to make up this perverted crap. 
[00:39:30]  The family would go, oh, no way.  She did that.  She did that in Vegas.  I guarantee.  You think that's it?  She did hook up a Hispanic guy and a white woman.  That is exactly what she did.  And that's what happened somewhere.  She's probably a nympho that was trying to change her ways and then realized, oh, my God.  I just can't do this.  I need sex.  I need sex.  I need that cock.  I need the cock.  I just went.  Started contacting the old boyfriends.  That wasn't working out too well. 
[00:40:00]  And then maybe in Vegas ran into a couple like this.  Maybe.  That's why you go to Vegas.  That is why a woman like this would run off to Vegas.  Where can I go in the United States where I could just probably hook up with a couple of people and have some sex?  Ah, Sin City, Vegas.  There you go.  She ends up there, hooks up with this couple, Hispanic guy and a woman.  And they probably did exactly this.  She probably sat on her face.  Guy's banging her.  Oh, he probably had her legs pinned back.  Just looking at this owl-eyed whore eat his girlfriend. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, God.  Let's say hi to George in New Jersey.  George?  Morning, guys.  Morning.  Hey, the cops knew this wasn't real the minute she said the other girl came on her face and the guy didn't blow a load.  Exactly.  Stop it.  I'm out.  All right.  Big eyes.  Is that just hitting the press?  The police report, finally?  I don't know.  It's on the smoking gun.  I don't know how long it's been here.  All right.  Let's go to Ben's raw ass.  Ben's raw ass?  We love Ben's raw ass. 
[00:41:00]  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I got a little funny story for you.  Uh-oh.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Is it a funny story?  Let's put our laughing hats on.  You guys ready for a funny story from Ben's raw ass?  They're clapping and applauding in the other room.  They're ready to go.  All right.  I was trying to hook up with this religious chick once, right?  And so was my friend at the same time.  So she said she was going to have to pray to God to tell her which guy to go out with, right?  Yeah.  Needless to say, she didn't pick me, but she also didn't put out. 
[00:41:30]  So he ended up raping her.  Ha-ha!  Wait a minute.  That actually...  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  I got to disagree with the boys.  That was funny and hot.  Okay!  Good story, sir.  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  All right.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Funny story?  Hmm.  Here's a bit where we talked about retards swimming with dolphins. 
[00:42:00]  Dummies.  You guys aren't going to add to that?  Oh no, it's fine  You explained it perfectly  Yeah, but that was just a set up  And then like we have a little cute back and forth talk  I say we leave it like that  Just like that?  Why not?  Just like that  What is it to say?  I mean sometimes the title says it retarts with dolphins  How do you add to that?  And then sometimes what you read afterwards  If you elaborate on it  It kind of ruins the bit  Because we talk about it in the  Who writes these up?  In the discussion  Who writes these up?  Oh, look at Eric having no problem throwing Danny under the bus 
[00:42:30]  He must fax him in since he's not here anymore  Yeah  He always puts like little punchlines  Story about retards swimming with dolphins  Is supposed to be therapeutic  Goofy on flipper and sea world whales  Trying to jump over their big water heads  Now that's funny  I've got to sit back and listen to this  Yeah, it's funny in the context of the bit  Yes  Not written on a page  Say Jim, nice meals  The worst of Opie and Anthony  There's some sexual reference  Live on the Today Show  There's some genetic disaster  I don't know why

Oh, I had the time all my life, and I could be, that I could be, that I could be, that I could be, that I could be, that I could be.  Hey, this is Pepper from COC.  I play guitar and sing in that goddamn band, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, which I'm probably going to be on. 
[00:55:00]  XM202, the Opie and Anthony show.  The alcoholic father.  This next bit is very, very sad.  From the makers of Diary of an Unborn Fetus, with Lil, what's his name?  Lil Marky.  Lil Marky.  Marky.  Yeah, he talked about how he was a fetus, and how he loved his mommy and daddy, and wanted to come out finally and meet his mommy, and he gave a month-by-month explanation of how he was growing.  And at the end, in a comic twist, he gets yanked out in an abortion. 
[00:55:30]  Yes, yes.  In this one, Lil Marky has an alcoholic father, and see what tragedies unfold because of that in this bit.  The alcoholic father.  Dun-dun!  Ow.  That hurt.  He's up on the gay shit.  Oh, gee.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Where's Martini Steve?  Is this good? 
[00:56:00]  We finally got the story of an alcoholic father.  Let's get the fucking Our Gang shorts-wearing psychopath in here.  It says, mostly very preachy and religious.  We're spanky.  And religious.  Our Gang.  Jesus.  Our Gang shorts.  Hey, Weezer.  I like that.  You've got the biggest shorts ever.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  That's a little bit of fabric.  You've got massive shorts on. 
[00:56:30]  You've got massive legs.  You're a big guy.  You really are.  I feel like you have linebacker calves.  I do.  I work out.  What's going on with this?  What's going on with this thing?  It's not as to the point as the first one, but it had some good need in it.  It's 14 minutes long.  I took two of the tracks.  One of them centers around an outburst from the alcoholic father.  And the second one is kind of a surprise ending.  I don't want to ruin it.  Oh, I like surprises.  Anybody else?  Perhaps.  Sure.  Perhaps. 
[00:57:00]  Let's try to guess.  A fatal car crash.  Don't tell us.  Don't tell us.  I'm going to guess a fatal car crash.  I'm going to guess dad is late for work one day and decides to get help.  Oh, really?  You're looking at the good thing.  I'm going to guess sodomy.  That would be a hot ending, not a surprise.  Either car crash or he pushes mom down the stairs.  Something violent.  I'm going to guess he's carrying scissors and he sneezes and accidentally gives mom a mastectomy. 
[00:57:30]  A mastectomy.  Well, here's the first track.  Let's listen in.  My dad was one of the black people called an alcoholic.  He used to drink so much.  At first he didn't.  He'd go to a party and one of those business kind, you know, and all the guys around said,  come on, Bob, take a drink or two.  He said, no, thank you.  Oh, come on, don't be one of those freaks.  So daddy said, in order not to be unsociable, he would go ahead and take a drink. 
[00:58:00]  Well, he kept drinking more and more, more parties and more drinks.  Sounds like fun.  Finally, daddy would drink before he got up in the morning, after he'd get home.  Before he got up in the morning?  How the fuck?  Did daddy have an IV by the bed?  I drank before he woke up.  And what would he say when he drank?  My kid sounds like a chipmunk.  My kid sounds like that fetus I had aborted.  Who the hell is that?  Yeah.  He pulled through, old hanger head. 
[00:58:30]  Bastard, who saw that coming?  Last time I go to that doctor.  Old doctor Nike in the stomach.  That's who you got to call.  You know, it went well when there's a tread print on her belly.  Wait, what's that?  Air Jordans, why is that on your belly?  Medical procedure.  My daddy jumped up and down on her belly until I shot across the wall.  Shot across the room, I should have said, but, you know, old litty. 
[00:59:00]  Get rid of that old inconvenience.  The old, we can't go to Atlantic City this weekend.  Yeah.  Jumping up and down on her stomach yelling, 18 years of financial freedom, coming up.  Vacations to places that don't have Ferris wheels, coming up.  We don't have to take separate flights anymore. 
[00:59:30]  Coming up.  Coming up.  Lace it up tight.  Here it comes.  Lace it up.  Set those buckets up, honey.  Let's make this fun.  Come on.  Steve, don't encourage him. 
[01:00:00]  It's the coming up.  Coming up.  That really sells it.  Well, he's just trying to make his life feel a little bit better, like this is something  we're accomplishing.  It's a good thing.  That's right.  All right, let's go back to this thing.  All right.  During dinner?  After dinner?  Before we go to bed, that's how bad it would do.  Well, Mr. Dad, I said, Daddy, I wish you'd get saved.  He said, I made me alone.  I said, Daddy, please, ask Jesus to come in your heart and save you. 
[01:00:30]  I said, credit.  I said, Daddy, if you don't get saved, you're going to go to hell.  You don't get saved?  There's a whole religious thing going on here, huh?  Yeah, these are, I did a little bit of research.  These are done by the characters called Little Marky, and they're a bunch of Christian records.  Little Marky.  Little Marky, and, yeah, they're all very preachy, so you've got to sift through all  that preachy stuff to get to the actual funny parts.  We're just a bunch of jerks. 
[01:01:00]  I like Little Marky.  Little Marky.  I wonder if he wears little boxers like Marky Mark, shows off those little abs, still has  that little thing coming out of his belly button.  Oh, I shouldn't have said that.  Oh, boy.  Daddy got up, and he started chasing me around the living room.  He told me if I didn't watch it, I was going to get you.  I said, oh, Daddy, please don't hit me.  He took a ball back, and he's going to swing.  And Mama come out right outside by the kitchen door just at the same time. 
[01:01:30]  Daddy's smarter.  If he hit me, he hit my Mama.  I like this guy.  Oh, this guy's a real go-getter.  Saves my ass.  Hand me that bad boy.  Chasing Little Marky.  And then Scatman Crothers came in, and he hit him in the chest.  Daddy's book was really redundant.  Mama tried to find me, and saw a bunny rabbit blowing another man. 
[01:02:00]  I was quite a willful young boy.  I needed to be corrected.  So did Mommy.  Oh, the drunk swings a towering high fly ball deep to center field.  Mom's head goes over the fence.  He caught it.  Oh, wait.  I thought it was a home run.  And he hit her. 
[01:02:30]  And he hit her.  And he hit her again.  Mama didn't move for a long time.  I thought she went to go to heaven.  Well, after Mommy got out of the hospital, Daddy promised he'd be a good boy.  Oh, he'd go to church Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night prayer meeting, Thursday night meditation.  Oh, my God. 
[01:03:00]  You just want to kill the whole family.  So the wife didn't leave.  The stupid wife.  He beats her almost to death with a baseball bat.  Put her in the hospital.  Put her in the hospital.  And she doesn't leave.  Because he promises to go to church.  Yeah, well, she shouldn't have swung the bat at him on the steps.  Backing up in that hotel.  That's where he got it.  Stay away.  I'm very confused.  And Daddy said she's had her whole fucking life to think things over. 
[01:03:30]  And wondered what a few minutes more was going to do her now.  She hit Daddy and dragged him to the meat locker.  And then Grady came to the door and he was very angry.  He said Daddy didn't have the stomach for him.  But he said he'd do better if he just let him out. 
[01:04:00]  Then he grabbed an axe.  And, well, you already heard Jimmy say, Scott, my brother's got it in the chair.  He's angry.  I have two little screen girls to play with.  Boy, are they creepy.  After Daddy beat Mommy, she looked like the woman in the tub.  All swollen.  I've got to hear more of what happens. 
[01:04:30]  All right.  It's the greatest opening theme in movie history.  With the car driving up the mountain.  Oh, it's the best music ever.  All right.  It got kind of rough around the house.  Daddy didn't let me and Mommy go to church very much.  Uh-oh.  My son and I had died so bad.  We had to sneak out of the house.  Oh, we went to the service and it was so great.  The singing was tremendous and the preaching was grand. 
[01:05:00]  Mom and I started home and we were so happy.  But yet, we were so burdened for Daddy.  Uh-oh.  Here it comes.  What happened now?  Here it comes.  There's always irony with these things.  All I know is the father said he was going to go to church.  He was going to be a good guy after beating up the wife with the baseball bat.  Going to his meeting.  Going to the meeting.  Going to church.  Then he starts falling back into his old bad habits.  He's drinking again.  Didn't go to church.  But the mother and the son go to church. 
[01:05:30]  And all I know is right now they're done.  They had a great time at church.  And are they driving home?  I believe they were driving home.  Who's driving?  Is that what I'm getting?  No, I think the mom's driving.  See, the ironic thing would be if they got hit by a drunk driver.  God, that would be great.  You know?  Please let it happen.  Could be.  But it was so burdened for our Daddy.  We opened the door.  Nope.  And there was Daddy sitting in his favorite chair again.  Is he dead?  Uh-oh.  No, he's in his favorite chair. 
[01:06:00]  Is Daddy dead?  Dad's in his favorite chair.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  Who is this?  Is this?  He was just drinking.  Oh, no.  He was drinking.  And he was drunk.  Oh.  Mommy walked over to him and she said,  Honey, when are you going to get your life straightened down and accept Jesus?  She deserves another faithful dinner.  He said, leave me alone. 
[01:06:30]  I couldn't believe my ears.  I said, Daddy, you promised Mommy and me you would never drink again.  Why did you do it?  I said, leave me alone.  Oh, Daddy, I'm going to pray for you, Daddy.  And my father said something I never heard him say.  Fuck you, you little fucking fucker.  Said something he never heard him say.  What do you think he said, Jimmy?  Um.  Hmm.  Stop talking, kid, and put this in your mouth. 
[01:07:00]  At least I hope that's what he said.  What could he have possibly said?  Um, Mommy's sleeping now.  Help me drag her to the tub and get that chainsaw.  And get those garbage bags.  Oh, my God.  I hope that's what he said.  What did he say?  I don't know.  It could be, I hate you.  Uh.  Maybe he said, uh, son. 
[01:07:30]  Drinking's more fun?  Son, you and your brother get in the minivan.  Mommy's taking you for a lift.  Oh.  Or, uh.  He said, you have to go to the Steinbergs.  Joel and Hedda are going to babysit you.  Quick.  Baby-killing parents.  Oh.  Hmm.  Such a shortage of them.  We got audio of what he said, I guess.  Yeah, let's.  I, I gotta, I gotta know what he said.  We're all wondering and waiting here.  I think this is what he said. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  If that cued up, I would have it.  Ooh.  All right.  Well, we'll go back to this then.  I hate you.  Yes, I hate you.  And I hate you, mother.  And I hate everybody.  I hate God.  Oh, God, I don't say that.  I do.  I love the little son of a bitch.  I fell to my bedroom and fell to the dead and broke it.  And I was laying down.  I said, Jesus, we got through the cross by then.  I said, this is your buddy, Marty. 
[01:08:30]  Speaking to me, did you hear my daddy out in the living room?  He said, he hates mommy.  He hates me.  He said, he hates you.  Oh, Jesus, I do anything to see my daddy say.  Please save you.  Oh, Jesus, I do anything to see my daddy out in the living room.  Oh, your daddy is a waste.  Accept it.  Deal with it.  Your daddy's a drunk. 
[01:09:00]  Your daddy is a sot and a sodomite.  And I cried myself to sleep that night.  I woke up the next morning.  I had a big pain in my chest.  I said, Daddy, Mama, come here, quick.  He ran in.  What's wrong?  Oh, my chest hurts so bad.  I said, will you stay home from Christian school today?  And you will.  I said, all right.  I stayed home.  And as the day went on, the worst I got.  How did I go to Christian doctor and he examine me? 
[01:09:30]  Marky?  Oh, I hurt so bad.  He has a broken heart over here.  Marky?  Oh, yes, sir.  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  What?  What?  Oh, yeah.  Who saw this coming?  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  I know what happened.  Little Marky and his mother apparently raped and killed this guy's wife and daughter. 
[01:10:00]  And he's asking, do you believe in Jesus?  Well, you're going to meet him.  You're going to meet him.  Oh, no.  Let's see.  Could it be fetal alcohol syndrome?  No.  No.  I don't know.  This kid's 11 already.  Are you ready to go see Jesus?  You mean I'm going to die?  He said, yes.  Well, I'm ready to go see Jesus.  But my dad is not. 
[01:10:30]  He said, I think you better call your mommy and daddy in right now.  And I did.  Daddy.  Song?  Mama.  No.  They walked in and they were both crying.  I said, daddy, the doctor said, I'm going to go see Jesus tonight.  And I'm so happy because I love Jesus and we're good friends for daddy.  I'll get to see you again.  Daddy said, why? 
[01:11:00]  I'm a good man.  Daddy, the Bible says, all of a sudden comes you in the glory of God.  And because you sinned away, you can sin his death, daddy.  But the gift of God to turn away.  He came to be afraid of daddy and I took it.  And mommy took it.  We've been wanting you to take it.  But daddy, you wouldn't do it.  Of course he's drinking.  Listen to this shit.  Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy don't go to hell.  I love you.  Daddy started crying very bad. 
[01:11:30]  You moved back from the room and I said, mama, please come here.  I could barely talk in a whisper.  My mama knelt down beside my mouth and she said, honey, what?  I said, mama, I'll see you in heaven, okay?  Okay.  Okay, honey.  I said, mommy, you pray for daddy, okay?  Okay.  I think daddy's going to get saved.  Okay. 
[01:12:00]  I think so, son.  Daddy.  Come here, daddy.  What?  What?  Daddy, why not so slow and so slow?  He looked down at me.  I was a bottle.  Took my hand and I reached up to him.  And he grabbed my little hand.  My little.  But he held it so tight.  I was a bottle.  Don't pull my fucking hand over there.  I believe you did.  Now, choke yourself.  Choke my hand, daddy. 
[01:12:30]  Don't pull my fucking hand over there.  I said, choke yourself.  And you hate him and my hand hurt.  Now, leave him over and choke yourself.  Well, no shit.  What happened to the kid?  He died.  From what?  Yeah, but what did he have?  I don't know.  He had something wrong with him.  He got a pain?  They called a Christian doctor to the house.  It's really the little house on the prairie.  You don't take the kid to a hospital or nothing.  What's that got to do with the father's drinking?  The father's drinking. 
[01:13:00]  I don't know, man.  It just takes a wild left turn about seven minutes into a 14-minute clip.  It's some kind of redemption thing.  See, the kid's fine with dying.  He was going to go see his pal Jesus.  But he'll never get to see his father again because his father doesn't believe in Jesus.  And he's going to another place.  He's going to hell.  And basically...  If that isn't a commercial for hell, I don't know what is.  If you don't believe in Jesus, you don't get to see the rest of your family that believes in Jesus when they die.  Maybe if Jesus had a little compassion, he'd fucking ask the father who's drinking and kicking the shit out of the mother and let the kid have a few years. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, really?  Maybe Jesus should cut the malarkey.  The Lord works in mysterious ways.  He sure does.  That are really fucked up and unfair.  Daddy, are you going to hell?  I'm already in it.  You sound like Marion, kid.  I'm going to be out of hell in about five minutes when your heart stops beating.  Take that awful blue room and change it into an office.  Coming up.  Steve, don't encourage him.  That's funny.  Out with Disney, in with Vegas. 
[01:14:00]  He's doing math in the head.  All right, $35 for this.  Flowers, little coffin, burial.  Little coffin.  Little Marky's coffin.  Wow, that's something, huh?  People are really disturbed by the fact that they're trying to convert someone using complete guilt.  Yeah, wasn't this kid killed a while back?  Well, that's right.  This kid never had a life.  This kid is just, I don't know, he's amazing. 
[01:14:30]  He dies at the end of every skit.  He's like Kenny.  Yeah.  I think Bob Kelly's at home right now blubbering into his...  Oh, Bob is just crying.  He's blubbering into his afghan.  When the little kid said, hold my hand, I understood.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Hold it.  There's a hanger in my head, dude.  There's a hanger in my head, dude.  I didn't see the kid dropping dead. 
[01:15:00]  Not again.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are we rolling?  We are rolling.  Yes, it's Opie, it's Anthony.  Look at this.  It's almost like the old days, Opie.  It's just the Opie and Anthony Show.  Kind of like this.  That's it.  It's just us here.  There's no guests, no Jimmy, nothing.  No producers.  Nothing.  I have to get your coffee, you know.  Yeah.  I like this a lot.  You want to jerk off? 
[01:15:30]  No, thank you.  No?  Hey, let's see who's got the biggest dick.  No one else is here to see.  Yeah.  It'll just be you and me, eh?  Remember that time in L.A. we...  What, Opie?  Don't talk about that.  I know.  I know.  Well, I'm not going to finish the story, screw it.  Let them try to figure it out.  Don't.  In the meantime, the fine mayor of New York City decided that he needed to hit the Spanish audience,  so he made a Spanish commercial. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, Spanish language, trying to get his voter, his voting audience up.  Yeah, so a light bulb went on in our heads, and we decided, you know, we could reach more  listeners as well if we started doing bits in Spanish.  Why not?  So that's what we did.  Here's Opie and Anthony, when they're not awful.  Okay, terrific.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  No more of that.  It's bad for you.  Anyway, let's get the Bill's Dead thing out of the way again.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, to explain, we were talking about the mayor of New York City yesterday. 
[01:16:30]  He's making commercials for Hispanics.  Well, he wants to win another term as mayor.  He's got a shitload of money.  I mean, the guy's a billionaire, so he can spend it, and he can spend it like other candidates  can't.  He could go for the niche advertising of himself.  You know, it costs a lot to make a commercial, and to make one in Spanish that just, you know,  exclusively for Spanish people, that might not be good for somebody on a limited budget. 
[01:17:00]  You want to cover as much ground as you can, but Bloomberg can just, it doesn't matter.  He can speak Yiddish to get to the Hasidics.  You know, he's one of those guys who can spend all that money, and that's what he did, and  he did one completely in Spanish.  And it sounded like he didn't really know how to speak the language.  Of course he didn't.  He just read it phonetically.  He read it phonetically.  So Anthony and I came up with a cute little idea, a quick idea, that maybe we should translate  some of our better bits into Spanish for the...  Maybe we'll get some Spanish listeners that way.  For the Spanish-speaking audience.  Imagine they're just tuning around the dial XM, and they hear all of a sudden some Spanish 
[01:17:30]  coming out.  And go, oh, what's this?  I think XM is launching a Spanish station, or a couple of them, or something like that.  So maybe we could, you know, give this bit to the Spanish station on XM.  And they could play it a few times.  So the only way this is going to make sense is to play the Bill's Dead phone call again.  I know it's kind of overplayed, but it is one of our favorites.  Basically, this old lady called one of the old stations we worked at.  Wrong number.  Wrong number, and we messed with her a little bit by telling her her dear friend Bill was 
[01:18:00]  dead.  A little bit.  So we're going to play the original, and then we'll come back for a quick second, and  we'll play the Spanish version.  All right.  All right.  But first year is the original.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  Now, this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Bill died today.  Yeah, kid.  Oh, my God. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  Who is this?  It's John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did this happen? 
[01:19:00]  This afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love him.  Yeah, big, big, big pile up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I got to go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  So, there's the original Bill's Dead call. 
[01:19:30]  Uh-huh.  Now, here's that same bit in Spanish.  Yeah.  Hey, it's making us chuckle today.  Listen for Who Is Is This?  Listen for our awful Spanish.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Bill's Dead in Spanish.  Hola.  Hola.  Hola.  Te amo.  ¿Quién es esto?  Patricio.  Patricio, ¿cómo estás?  No estoy hablando con el que llamo equivocando. 
[01:20:00]  Ah, pues, Patricio, yo tengo malas noticias.  ¿Qué?  Ah, Guillermo se murió hoy.  Estoy llamando.  Ay, Dios mío.  Sí, qué tragedia.  ¿Quién es esto?  Él estuvo en un accidente de codo.  Ay, no.  ¿Quién es esto? 
[01:20:30]  Esto es Juan.  Juan?  Sí.  Ave María.  Dios mío, yo no lo creo.  Sí.  Pedro, yo estaba hablando con él no hace mucho.  Yo sé.  ¿Cuándo peso esto?  Esta tarde.  ¿A dónde? 
[01:21:00]  En la carretera.  Ay, que Dios lo quiera.  Sí, grande, grande, ok.  Pues, esta seguro que la de los hijos al paciente.  Pues, me tengo que ir.  Está bien, Juan.  Está bien.  Gracias. 
[01:21:30]  Hasta luego.  Hasta luego.  No.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  No, ya está.  Es soo stupid.  No, ya está.  You can pick up on a few of the classic lines.  Dunday.  Just a note.  Dunday.  Dunday.  Dunday.  The bit's twice as long because we have to try to do it in Spanish. 
[01:22:00]  I know.  Our awful Spanish.  Un accidento.  Un.  Un.  Un.  Un.  Are you French?  Well, I took a little French, too, in high school, so I got it all mixed up, I guess.  Rumped off a little bit.  A little bit, a little bit.  All right.  Well, there you have that.  This channel is experiencing technical difficulties.  Please stand by.  We're working on the problem. 
[01:22:30]  Technical difficulties.  Probably just faulty equipment.  Or Ben's hog hit the circuit breaker and tripped it.  Steve poured a martini in the mixing board.  Or Hulk's breath burnt through the transmission cord.  Sandy Cain blocked the sky with Twato.  Or Bob Kelly vomited all over the console.  Or Howard Stern bought XM for half a billion.  Or Pat from Unaki drove his van through the building.  What's the meaning?  The scene-free messages are repeating.  The only way to fix it is a corporate meeting.  And Opie's not around. 
[01:23:00]  He's rollerblading in the park.  And Professor Anthony can't even get it to start.  It's taking forever.  I hope it don't last long.  They stalker Patty crawling with a crusty mask on.  Or maybe Danny told Ricky to stop the show.  Or Opie threw a chocolate strawberry at ELO.  Hi, it's Jim Norton.  And this is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Here we go, guys.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And we're going to do a little bit here where, I don't know. 
[01:23:30]  Good one.  It's a great intro.  What happened?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  While at Anthony's apartment, Owen are listening to a phone scanner and scaring the woman who lives on the first floor.  She got so freaked out, she invited the guy over she was talking to and got laid.  Yeah.  This is actually a really funny bit.  What is it?  I don't remember it.  Well, you know, people have listened to scanners for many, many years.  I used to have a scanner. 
[01:24:00]  And I would listen to police calls and stuff like that.  But one little thing I noticed is I could get cellular phone calls on it.  So I would listen to people on their cell phones and cordless phones in your house.  So the woman downstairs from me was using a cordless phone.  And we were upstairs listening to her conversation.  And we figured we could make it interactive by making noises upstairs and doing things outside that would get her to talk on the phone.  And get a reaction. 
[01:24:30]  And this is us talking about that very instance in much more detail with much more of a comic element to it.  Oh, wow.  I would hope.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Bottle.  We have a real good scanner story that we haven't told in a while.  Oh, my God.  I have a scanner.  I've had one for years.  And, yeah, you can pick up cell phones and cordless phones.  And the conversations I've heard over the years, hysterical.  I was out in the Hamptons once listening to phone calls. 
[01:25:00]  And a couple of gay guys talking on the phone, you know, as they were gay guys.  No, they were talking about fisting.  Really?  Yeah.  It was hysterical.  Sitting there, like, listening to this guy going, you know, I'll bury it up to the elbow.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Wow.  Heard breakups, drug deals, affairs. 
[01:25:30]  It was great entertainment.  You'd have to sift through all the crap, you know.  Be home in an hour, honey.  Oh, great.  Good call.  Tell them about the call we heard that one night.  Oh, what?  Up in the apartment?  Yeah.  We're all hanging out, drinking at Anthony's place, checking out the scanner.  Up in Boston, yeah.  Checking out the scanner, you know, and got a nice strong signal.  Heard some girl talking on the phone.  And she's talking to some guy about how her boyfriend sucks and how she kind of wants to get together with this guy. 
[01:26:00]  And blah, blah, blah.  So, at one point, we're listening to the scanner, but we're also joking around and laughing.  And at one point, I guess, we were laughing and I slammed the floor with my foot.  Opie stomped on the floor.  You know how you do that?  Because I was laughing so hard, right?  A real knee slapper type thing.  So, all of a sudden, the girl on the phone that we're listening to on the scanner goes,  Oh, people upstairs again, banging.  Like, holy jeez, it's that person downstairs. 
[01:26:30]  And then she starts going,  Oh, it's not the first time.  They walk around up there like elephants.  I think they must weigh 500 pounds.  And then she starts saying,  Now, this is me, Jen, Opie, and his girlfriend, Sandy.  Right.  Sitting there.  I think there was another couple there, too.  Making it more embarrassing.  And we hadn't been on the air long together,  so it's not like we had a friendship, really a good friendship.  You know what I mean?  We were still getting to know each other. 
[01:27:00]  We were still getting to know each other.  This goes way back.  Go ahead.  So, then she's like,  And their bedroom is right over mine.  So, all I'm hearing at night is,  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Boom, boom, boom.  The bed.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I just heard Pete ran.  I'm looking.  Opie's laughing his ass off.  Oh, it's disgusting. 
[01:27:30]  Right.  I'm like, oh, well, maybe it's not downstairs.  But it was downstairs.  It was, because then we started effing with her.  Because then we decided to play interactive phone call.  Well, it was, I believe it was Halloween night.  Right.  So, she was kind of scared to be alone.  She was talking to this guy.  Well, and, I mean, your apartment complex, pretty much everyone was scared to be alone.  Oh, my God.  Halloween night.  Well, when you look outside and you see somebody just bagged a zebra and were dragging it back into their, uh, lean-to. 
[01:28:00]  I was in a bad neighborhood, man.  When it would rain, I swear to you.  When it rained?  When it rained, it was the highlight of the day for the six billion little children that lived there.  Because they could play in the pothole puddles.  It was like a little pool for them.  I was just waiting for one of them to go to the shores of one of the puddles and have a croc come in, grab them, drag them in. 
[01:28:30]  I swear, this neighborhood.  There was, there were people.  It was an apartment, apartment building.  Right.  Outside of the little porch of your apartment, someone had fenced off a whole area, planted grass, and was raising chickens.  I swear to you.  It was the community property.  Yeah, it was, like, he took up three people's back yards, because no one had a yard.  He had a cement patio with a wrought iron fence around it. 
[01:29:00]  That's your yard.  This guy decides, you know, hey, I'm going to make a fence.  I'm going to make a fence and raise a chicken, just like I did back in Puerto Rico.  And they would fence off the area.  Beautiful lawn.  I mean, he had it well kept.  Raising chickens.  So freaking funny.  Frightening neighborhood.  The second I moved in, like, what floor do you want to stay on?  What's the top one?  I want the high ground.  Love the high ground.  Every night, the police were there. 
[01:29:30]  There was something going on.  Some domestic dispute going on.  Someone's head was going through a wall.  It was wonderful.  So we're listening to the lady downstairs on the scanner.  So she's kind of scared, and she's talking to this guy.  So we decide to go out onto the porch, which is right above her porch, three high,  and throw things at her sliding glass door from our porch.  So we're taking little pieces of candy and stuff and leaning over and winging it.  So we'd hear it hit the door and hear her go,  Oh, my God, what was that? 
[01:30:00]  It was just so much fun, because we're listening to the conversation and controlling what she's saying.  Then we decided we were going to ring her buzzer and run.  So it was down on the first floor.  I'm on the third floor.  So Opie goes downstairs to the buzzer.  And after coaxing him for a half hour, come on, you've got to do it, you've got to do it, buzzes it.  I hear him start running up the stairs.  You can hear it on the phone.  On the phone.  And then I just hear this horrible, he tripped going up the stairs, some getaway. 
[01:30:30]  Because she was on the second floor, so we had to run past her floor to get back upstairs before she opened the door.  Because we were paranoid, convinced that if she opened up her door and I'm just casually walking like I'm there visiting you,  that she was going to bust us.  And it turns out, the whole end to this whole thing is we got the guy late.  Because she got so scared at what was going on, she said, you better come over here.  And he's like, oh really?  She was like, yeah, I'm very scared.  Well, it's important to the story.  The guy talking to this lady was trying to pick her up the whole time. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  And she's like, no, no, kind of give him the brush off.  My boyfriend's driving by.  We got her so freaked out by the end of the conversation.  Yeah, she invited him over for the night.  Scanners are fun, though, man.  They used to have a blast with those things.  That's a great story.  Forgot all about that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, we talk about the River Rose.  Ah, the River Rose.  Our buddy Billy Mac has a party boat.  Charters it out for people.  Jimmy really shines when we talk about gay subjects. 
[01:31:30]  So sit back and enjoy it.  Jimmy excitedly talks about the gay cruise.  I'm not going on it.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Should we talk about the cruise now, or what?  Oh, I can't wait.  Here we go.  That's what I need.  To take off the sting of my stunning defeat, I need to go for a ride on the River Rose.  The River Rose.  That's where you do some spinning, but it's with a mule between your ass cheeks.  What the hell is the River Rose? 
[01:32:00]  I don't know.  Ben, what is Ben?  This is one of our buddy's boats.  Now, I went out on this boat for 4th of July.  You've been on the River Rose?  You've been on the River Rose?  Oh.  They have specialty cruises that I have no clue what they are, and he hadn't started doing  this yet.  Did you go on the Periwinkle Cruise?  No, I wasn't on the Periwinkle Cruise.  I went on the 4th of July, about four years ago, I guess, and we went up the East River,  right by the United Nations, right where the fireworks are set off, and it was really great. 
[01:32:30]  Did some drinking on there, watching the fireworks.  It was a really good time.  We should get a booze cruise together for this show.  Yeah.  Thinking about the Bill O'Reilly disaster.  How about the cruise right here?  The River Rose?  The one they're talking about.  They have to change it to the River Tulip Sunny Oregon.  Well, apparently, one 4th of July cruise a year isn't enough to keep the boat going,  so he's opened up the boat to various specialty cruises, and I guess one that he's advertising  is... 
[01:33:00]  The River Rose is available for alternative lifestyle weddings, engagements, birthdays,  or any occasion.  Any occasion.  Basically, no matter where you stick your dick, you can do it on this boat.  Midnight cruises, sunset cruises, Sunday tea dances.  Oh, Sunday tea dances.  No, no, and it's spelled T-E-A, but I think it's supposed to be just the letter T.  T.  Everybody does those dances.  It says, we're leaving quickly, leaving quickly. 
[01:33:30]  Tea dance.  The Gay Pride Weekend Sunset Cruise.  Basically, you know, you can watch the sun go down.  I'll go to the rim.  Sunset.  Hey, set your sun on this car.  Well, that's right.  And then he can set his eyes on his friends' families who appear normal, while yours doesn't.  How come there's a mom and dad in that home, and I just have two fellas with bathrobes  who cough a lot.  Breathrobes. 
[01:34:00]  He was so excited about his joke.  I know.  That's right.  It was a Japanese fact.  That was more just excitement coming out.  He knew he had a good one.  Breathrobes.  Oh, my breathrobes.  Yeah, me cough.  Gay Pride Weekend Sunset Cruise, Friday, June 24th.  Boarding at 6.45 p.m.  Returns at 11 o'clock p.m.  And God knows what's going to happen during that cruise.  That's right.  It's going to be sassy.  You're going to have to squeegee the deck off when he gets back. 
[01:34:30]  Cruise the skyline.  Oh, this is around here.  I thought this was in Florida.  Cruise the skyline of Manhattan's Statue of Liberty.  That's right.  Just see a...  Which is actually a tranny, the Statue of Liberty.  Hi, Daddy.  Hi, Big Big Daddy.  Wave a big thing in the air.  Aboard the River Road.  Sailing from the World's Fair Marina in Queens.  There's free parking there.  Our Sunset Cruise features guest DJs to the sounds of 70s, 80s, 90s, disco classics.  Yeah.  House music, salsa merengue, cash bar with bar, special beer, wine, mixed drinks. 
[01:35:00]  Ron B. as Tina Turner.  Oh, no.  That's right.  What a shock.  A female impersonator will host a show featuring Miss Mess, performing a salute to disco.  Be sure to get your tics early in the three exclamation points.  Of course.  Which means they're going fast.  $35.  Pitch a neural disease in the Navy.  Drop down to your knees. 
[01:35:30]  Pitch a neural disease in the Navy.  Pitch a neural disease in the Navy.  Pitch a neural disease in the Navy.  $35 in advance on our site.  Put your dick in another man.  Stick it in his can.  In the Navy.  In the Navy.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's a ball bag on acid.  And my acid black and blue.  They want you. 
[01:36:00]  I'll suck off a Puerto Rican or a Jew.  All right, so be sure to hop on the hip cruise.  $35 in advance or $40 at Dockside.  Oh, Dockside.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  I heard that wrong.  I love the website.  www.divasdamesanddykes.com  You know what you're getting when you go there.  www.divasdamesanddykes.com 
[01:36:30]  Yes.  Woo!  In the Navy.  Catch the HIV.  Yes.  So he's doing gay cruises, obviously.  Yes, our friend, who ironically has a gay porno mustache, will be fine.  Yes, he does.  They're going to say, everyone that gets on the boat with Billy, is going to say,  didn't I see you in 1978 in a film? 
[01:37:00]  Ah, no.  Somebody else.  I just can't picture him on this cruise.  Does he go or does he just send the boat out by itself, leave it to his own devices?  I bet he goes.  I bet he goes.  He probably ties his shirt and a little fucking bow in the front and wears Speedos and a pair  of sneakers with no socks.  Oh, he's a queen.  All right, divasdamesanddykes.com, or you can email divasdamesdykes at aol.com.  And it's June 24th of Friday night, and it should be a nice cruise. 
[01:37:30]  I've actually cruised around in the boats, not this particular one.  No?  But, yeah, it's actually cool.  You went on a gay cruise?  I certainly didn't.  Oh, okay.  It was the comedy solo cruise.  We should get a booze cruise together, though.  Squeegee the deck.  It looks like a bunch of white jellyfish behind the boat.  Chasing it.  Hey, somebody spilled silicone implants all over the place.  No, no, no.  Hey, everyone wants to talk about gravity.  We're done with the gravity thing.  And, by the way, you don't have to squeegee the deck.  Just ask the guests to lick the floor before they go off the boat. 
[01:38:00]  Or to listen to Opie and Anthony is more good than to work in the Fruit Roll-Up Factory, making  the Fruit Roll-Up.  When I was in Russia, we work and make things that's so much better than your Americans.  Because, you know, what do you...  Let me just...  Well, you already know, but...  You don't want to work.  Work good for you.  Right.  Why you don't want to work?  I was farting so bad, and it stunk so bad. 
[01:38:30]  You fat Americans.  Right.  Russia is so much better than you, my friend.  I think that would be something that maybe people should need to know.  Okay.  Back to work.  XM 202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, yes.  Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine stopped by the XM Studios, and...  What a great, fun time we had that day.  Ah, the music, the laughter. 
[01:39:00]  We played some of the Paul Anka tapes, I remember.  And Richard Cheese, not a big fan of the Paul Anka.  Feels he's ripping them off.  Hoo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  Tell him, Fred.  The tool.  Shut up.  And, of course, Richard and the band, they redid one of our classic songs.  Yes.  One of our favorite songs on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Mm-hmm.  So why don't you just sit back and listen and see how this all develops.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Lo más mal de Opie and Anthony. 
[01:39:30]  En XM 2.  Cero dos.  Good evening.  Yes, just want me to start singing?  No good morning, Richard Cheese?  No, no good morning, Richard.  I'm sitting at home with my dick on hard.  So I got the black book for a freak to call.  Picked up the telephone and dialed the seven digits.  Said, yo, this RC baby, are you down with it?  I arrived at her house, knocked on the door. 
[01:40:00]  Not having no idea what the night had in store.  I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning.  I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Girls always ask me why I fuck so much.  I say, what's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut? 
[01:40:30]  You can say I'm desperate, even call me perverted.  But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted.  My dad'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted.  Your mom'll be so mad if she knew I got that ass.  I'm a dog in heat, a freak without warning.  I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  Everybody sing along, won't you? 
[01:41:00]  Oh, me so horny.  Oh, me so horny.  No one sing along, for God's sake.  You said it yourself, you like it like I do.  Put your lips on my dick and suck my asshole too.  I'm a dog in heat, a freak without warning.  My appetite is sex, cause me so horny.  Me so horny. 
[01:41:30]  Me so horny.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  Wow.  Bravo.  Richard Eason.  In studio.  What's up, Richard?  Oh, man.  Good to see you, Opie and Anthony.  Thank you so much.  Good to see you.  This is such a nice place.  This is so much better than the dive he used to play in.  Yeah.  We are so glad.  Place was a dump.  It was.  And thank you for all the pictures of the ladies.  This is lovely.  We got quite a collection started here. 
[01:42:00]  Quite a collection.  It's lovely, beautiful starlets and singers.  Yeah, this is good.  How long have you been in this room?  About a year.  Almost.  Well, in October, it'll be a year.  It's so cute.  They built this room.  Fabulous.  They did, didn't they?  It's your room.  There's a big Opie and Anthony sign.  This whole place is going to be ours out there.  Really?  Doesn't it have a feel and a smell that says the Opie and Anthony spell?  It's mostly the smell.  Yeah.  Mostly.  Not so much the feel.  Sorry about that.  Let me just say, speaking of feel, how about these guys, the band?  I brought the kids in.  The whole band.  On the bass, Gordon Brie. 
[01:42:30]  Play a little bass there, Gordon.  And then on the drums, Mr. Frank Fetta, everybody.  And on the piano, the great Bobby Ricotta, everybody.  Pickle in the Ivories.  That's right.  And I'm Richard Cheese.  Thank you so much for having me in.  We didn't even get practice.  We just walked in and started singing.  It was set up, and you guys were playing, and you're singing within three seconds of  actually setting everything up.  That's right.  Very Vegas.  Very live.  Very swinging late night show.  Absolutely.  Very exciting.  And Richard, you got a new album out, huh?  I do.  You know, it's a brand new CD.  It's called Apertif for Destruction. 
[01:43:00]  I love it.  And it's available in stores everywhere, and at iloverichardcheese.com.  And also at iTunes, which is good, which sort of helps the motherfuckers who like to download  the music illegally.  This gets them a head start.  It's already been formatted into a tradable, burnable format.  So thank you.  Great.  I see you sell thongs.  I love dick.  Yeah, I brought some, actually.  I was hoping there'd be a bevy of hot female producers on the show. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, well, what's around?  And I'm exactly 100% wrong on what I saw.  Yes, you are.  These are the hot thongs.  These are great.  We're smart.  Richard, we're smart.  If we knew that there were hot women all around all the time, we would never do a good radio  show.  So we had to sacrifice that part of it.  Well, yeah, that's why they're not here.  The show is really good.  The show is really good.  That's how many women there aren't around here.  Seriously, I've not seen this many dicks since this morning.  When the band woke up in bed next to me.  And that'll happen.  Seriously, get a chick in here. 
[01:44:00]  One girl would be nice.  Can we get a listener to drive down?  One girl?  Remember the old days when they were, you know, chicks coming in?  Yeah, calling all whores.  Yeah.  Well, we could get some girls down here to get their I Love Dick panties.  That'd be good.  You think that'll work?  Sure, why not?  It's a size two.  So someone medium, you know what I'm saying?  Well, all right.  We haven't seen our listeners.  Yeah, now you're asking for a lot.  You might want to staple two of those together.  Okay, I will.  Hey, can I get a chair for Richard Cheese? 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, why doesn't Richard Cheese have a chair?  Yeah, we're in my damn chair.  We should say hi to Ben Bailey, too, who has entered the festivities.  Ben Bailey finally woke up.  How you doing, man?  I'm doing good.  Came in?  Yeah, I was stuck on a train.  It's the life of a comic, right?  Oh, stuck on a train.  Sure you are.  Yeah, of course you are.  I only would have been a half hour late if it hadn't been for that five-minute delay on the train.  That darn train.  Don't you love when you're late for work or something?  Because I used to do this, too.  You wake up, you're real late, because I would do that all the time.  You drive to work, and you do hit some weird traffic thing that only takes about five minutes to get through. 
[01:45:00]  But it gives you the reality of the excuse, because now you walk in and go,  Ah, traffic, I hit it with an accident or something.  And you're not really lying.  You have some motivation for your acting when you're going through the boss.  Yeah, you can actually deliver it, make it believable.  Yeah, a little more believable instead of,  I can't believe the traffic today.  Rachel, you've come back.  It was truly awful.  We're lucky I made it at all. 
[01:45:30]  You know what I can't stand is when you get somewhere and you had trouble getting there.  And by the time you finally get there, everybody there is an expert on why you had a problem getting there.  You're like, oh, you're stuck on the train.  Oh, you can't take the train at this hour.  You fool, you should have gotten a cab.  Oh, well, where were you when I needed you?  You know what, I did take the train.  It only took me three minutes, asshole.  Yeah, I'm lying, idiot.  I overslept.  I'm lying.  I'm a liar.  You're stupid.  Let's say hi to Fred in Brooklyn.  Fred, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys? 
[01:46:00]  Tell him, Fred.  Hey, I was watching that The One of the Dead.  And out of nowhere came that Richard Cheese song, The Sickness.  That's right.  We did Down With The Sickness.  Give me a little Down With The Sickness, boys.  Isn't that great?  Yeah, this is a great story.  The director of the movie, Dawn of the Dead, he was listening to the CD on the set.  And one thing led to another.  And they said, let's put that song in the movie.  And they paid us.  They actually paid us a couple grand or something like that.  Really?  And for every DVD that sells, we get, I think it's nothing. 
[01:46:30]  We get nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  So that's pretty good.  But it was great exposure.  We got some good fans, including Fred, who, by the way, also a dude.  I don't know if you're keeping track at home.  Oh, if you go with phone calls, too?  Yeah, we get it.  It's all actors or guys.  This is a big, yeah, male dick fest.  Well, let me tell you.  It's one big sausage party.  Let's have a dick fest right now with a little Richard Cheese.  A little dick, if you know what I'm saying.  Thank you.  I'm complaining and learned to love the cock, Richard.  Thank you.  I might.  As you paged through the Playboy that was right in front of my microphone, now it's over there.  You show up late. 
[01:47:00]  I'm not sure what happened.  Fucking stole my magazine.  Stole his pornography.  My band is playing a little song by Disturb, ladies and gentlemen.  Do you feel that?  Oh, shit.  Oh, wah, ah, ah, ah.  Oh, wah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 
[01:47:30]  Get down with the dickness  Open up your hate and let it flow into me  I can see inside you the sickness is rising 
[01:48:00]  It seems that all that was good has died  Oh no, the Bowery Ballroom  Which we're playing out on Saturday night  Is a scary place  Now that you've woken up the demon in me  Alright boys, will you give it to me?  Two, three, four  Get up, come on, get down with the sickness  You mother, get up, come on, get down with the sickness 
[01:48:30]  You fucker, get up, come on, get down with the sickness  Open up your hate and let it flow into me  Why can't you just fuck off and die?  Get down with the sickness  Fuck you, I don't need this shit, I'm down with the sickness  You stupid, sadistic, abusive fucking whore  Get down with the sickness  Here it comes  Get ready to die  Get ready to  Die 
[01:49:00]  Richard Cheese, everyone  Thank you  Uncensored for the first time anywhere on broadcast radio  Isn't that fantastic?  I love richardcheese.com for more information  We should get him downstairs at the Steinway joint again  Imagine that  The Steinway headquarters  Bobby, my piano player, the Steinway headquarters are right next door  Right downstairs  If you go down when you came in the lobby, it's to the right  So we can go down there and maybe jam, play a couple of songs  Well, John Valby might have wrecked that for everybody  You know who John Valby is, right? 
[01:49:30]  You really don't?  I've heard the name, I don't remember who he is  You call him Dr. Dirty  Dr. Dirty  Oh, yeah, okay, I know who this guy is  He's an amazing pianist  Yeah  That just happens to sing really dirty songs  The C word, everything, okay?  He says cunt?  Wait a minute, you say C word when you're on XM?  Well, yeah, we leave that to other people on the show  Oh, that's nice  It's like an old habit, we're used to doing broadcast radio  So we still do the initial thing from time to time  So Valby was up here, he didn't have a keyboard  So we told him to go downstairs  And we asked politely if we could use one of their awesome Steinway pianos 
[01:50:00]  Like, what do they cost?  Like, a hundred grand or something crazy like that?  Easily  So he started playing just beautifully  And then finally kicked into one of his songs  And just horrified everyone down there  That had their suits on and stuff  Did you bring a microphone down there?  Oh, yeah, well, we brought a cell phone  Oh, the old days, it was a cell phone  Such good sound quality we got out of the piano  A hundred thousand dollar Steinway through a cell phone  Sounds just the way they meant it to be heard  If it's a mobile, a T-Mobile 
[01:50:30]  The quality for the Steinway is really good  Is it?  It's got a Steinway setting on it, I believe  That's right  It's got real Steinway tones  Speaking of which, we have fucking ringtones  Everyone's got ringtones  We got Richard Cheese ringtones  If you go to iloverichardcheese.com  You can download them, I swear to God  See, that's a pretty cool ringtone to have, though  Like, some of the people with ringtones are like  Why does Newt Gingrich have a ringtone?  Like, what?  Some people, you just  Music makes a good ringtone  Can I just say something? 
[01:51:00]  It's good to have you guys back  Am I right?  Thank you, Richard  Because they're funny, am I right, fellas?  Are they funny or what?  The band concurs, I like that  It's so true  You guys, I missed you  Now, you're back on the air  It is just a thrill and an honor  And I hope they're paying you  And I hope there's actually people who get the service  Well, they  Yeah  They certainly are  How many listeners have you got on this show?  Any idea?  How many people are on XM these days?  Well, I think listening to our show  I think we're up to about 180  That's pretty good  That's about right 
[01:51:30]  XM has well over 4 million  I was just at XM's headquarters in Washington, D.C. the other day  You were down there?  I was down there  I saw the big sign  It says 4 billion served  I'm at 4 million served up on top  Yep  And that's a nice facility  When we signed with these guys  A little less than a year ago  It was like 2.1, 2.2  Really?  That's pretty good  It's growing that fast  I'll go out on a limb and say  They've almost doubled it  I don't know how you do the math so fast like that  But thank you  Slow down 
[01:52:00]  It's early in the morning  I like to show off like that  It was pretty good  Richard, the next time you come by  You see all those cubicles?  They're going to be gone out there  There's a bunch of sales weasels out there right now  They're all leaving  And we're going to have a nice performance area  No kidding  And we're going to have a pole for the ladies to do their thing  We're going to build a stage  A pole  So when the ladies strippers come in  And they bitch about having to take their clothes off  Like they do now  We could actually put them in the work environment that they're used to  Where they feel they could take their clothes off and do the pole act  Can you get at home if Norton's here anyway? 
[01:52:30]  Well, I think Norton scares them sometimes  I love Jim Norton, by the way  I met Jim Norton for the first time on this show  And now I see him all over  He's fabulous  He's blowing up  That's good  He's here in Texas  Well, we're here all morning for you guys  We'll play as many songs as you want  And do not plug my CD anymore  Oh, no?  Because you've already done it once  And that's all I need  I just want you to know  I'm here for the love  And for you guys  Where can people get the CD that we're not plugging?  No, I really don't want to talk about it  I'm not even going to do it  You're not going to tell people where they can get it? 
[01:53:00]  Look at me  Not even doing it  Where's the website that you don't want to give out?  Not doing it  This is my sincere love for you guys  Yeah, right  This is not  I'm not here to sell  I'm here to care  Come on  But seriously  You guys want to play another song?  You want us to play a song?  Yeah, let's play another one here  And by the way  Bobby Ricotta  Tickling the Ivories  Through the whole segment  Make sure you play The Tired Yet  That's so impressive  Make sure you play some of the dirtier stuff  Because there's a cell I'm here for  I would love to do  I'm looking at my CD  What's the dirtiest song on the regular set? 
[01:53:30]  How about we do a little  Nine Inch Nails for the kids?  Oh, nice  Start it up for us there, buddy  I mean, Frank  Is this going to be just like  The  Old drummer name  I get confused  You know what song it is  Is this going to be just like  Johnny Cash's version of Hurt?  Oh, man  How great was that record?  Start it up for us, boys  That was a wonderful song  When he did Hurt  On the American Recordings  Yeah, this is almost as good as Johnny Cash  Little Nine Inch Nails with a taste of Sesame Street built right in 
[01:54:00]  Oh, yeah  Here we go to that  Love this tune  Thank you, fellas  Can you hear the bass okay?  You let me complicate you  Help me, I broke apart my inside  Help me, I've got no soul to sell 
[01:54:30]  Can you hear the bass okay?  Oh, yeah  Help me, the only thing that works for me  Help me get away from myself  I wanna fuck you like an animal  I wanna feel you from the inside  I wanna fuck you like an animal  My whole existence is flawed  You get me closer to God  He's beatboxing, ladies and gentlemen 
[01:55:00]  Oh, wow  You can have my isolation  Bass  You can have the hate that it brings  Beatbox, high hat  You can have my absence of faith  Piano  You can have my everything  Singer  I wanna fuck you like an animal  I want to feel you from the inside 
[01:55:30]  I wanna fuck you with an animal  My whole existence is flawed  You get me closer to God  God!  Thank you  That was Frank Fett on the drums and the beatbox  How great was that?  He does that with his mouth  That's amazing  Let's call his girlfriend and have her describe what he does 
[01:56:00]  with that when he's not playing at the gigs  What else he can do?  She's asleep  Well, that hasn't stopped Opie and Anthony before  I love richardcheese.com  Thank you  I love it too  Hey, by the way  Have you got a gig in New York?  Yeah, we're playing Saturday night at the Bowery Ballroom  And it's sold out, though  But you guys are welcome  In fact, everyone on the staff  Who's a girl  And Opie and Anthony  Can go  Wow  That's rough  Sorry, guys  But seriously  Sex change operation  Anything  Please  Just a woman  Any woman  But I know that 
[01:56:30]  I don't know how long you want us on the air  But I do have a topic that I'd love to talk about  Yes  At some point  That involves me swearing a lot  Oh, yeah?  Because I'm very angry about something  And this is the only radio show  Well, vent  Go for it  That's what it's about  This is the platform that I've been waiting for  But I need to take some water  Can I get some hot water for tea?  Hot water for tea?  Wow  My throat hurts  What the hell happened to us?  It used to be all about the booze  Well, you know  I'm hot  It's a little early  By the way, congratulations to Boston  What happened over there?  New York may be America's most intoxicating city 
[01:57:00]  But when it comes to pot  Boston and Boulder are on a higher level  Cack, cack, cack, cack  All the college towns  They said that all the college towns  Which is a big surprise  Yeah  This is pretty sick, actually  According to a new government study  12.1% of folks in Boston  And 10.3% in Boulder  Reported smoking marijuana in the past month  12%?  That's what they're saying  Wow  That is a lot of people  12.1% of Boston  That seems low  That seems really low  Low?  Low? 
[01:57:30]  I'm thinking high  You've got to think of like  I'm thinking high  But that includes  Doesn't that number include like children?  Like infants and the elderly?  Yeah, I mean slow down there  That's everybody  I'm sure if you said of college age  It would be higher than 12%  It's more of a lot on another limb here  It's more or less one out of eight  In Boston smoking the dope in the past month  One out of eight  Remember Smoke Two Joints?  For math  Give me a little rhythm and give me a C 
[01:58:00]  One out of eight  I guess that's a lot  Go ahead  That's a lot  You've got to figure some people didn't admit it  One, two, three  That's true too  Uh-oh  We got a song  Retaining to your fabulous news site  Great  Oh, alright  Gordon on the bass  It's awesome  Smoke Two Joints in the morning  I smoke Two Joints at night  Thank you, okay  That's all we know  It was very timely though  What we make up for with the quantity  I've heard that song  Yeah, we used to do that live 
[01:58:30]  But you know  The potheads in the band left  So we don't have the legal right to do it anymore  Yeah, is this a new band?  It's a brand new band  We've got a new bass player  New drummer  And the new piano player  And oddly enough  The original piano player  Is in town today  In New York  Really?  Out of Chicago  And the other piano player  Who fucking sucked  Oh, wow  Is also in town  Doing a very plum gig this morning  With the Hilary Duff band  Was on TV?  Yeah  This morning  I think it was on  Whatever that  Good Morning America 
[01:59:00]  Today Show had him on  Today Show  Is there a  Was there a little  There's always tension  In the Richard Cheese organization  Little tension  Are you tough?  Are you like  A tough  I'm a pussycat  Do I pay you guys well or what?  Cause I'm thinking  I'm thinking we got another Paul Anka over here  I've heard the Paul Anka  Behind the scenes tapes  And maybe you're like that  Did you really?  Are there Paul Anka tapes?  You haven't heard the Paul Anka  Oh my god  You don't hear this fucking scumbag  Going to go to town 
[01:59:30]  He just put out a new CD  That is in direct competition  With the Richard Cheese Empire  Absolutely  And that's one of the things I was angry about  I was going to ask you about this  Cause you've been doing this a very long time  And now you've got these guys  That can't sell records anymore  And decided this is a way to go  And they found a niche for themselves  Out of nowhere  I just  So it's like Paul Anka  Old school guy  Doing exactly what you're doing Richard  He just put out his new CD  Which is called Rock Swings  Not as clever as  Lounge Against the Machine  No  And it's got Smells Like Teen Spirit on it  Which we do in our act  It's got 
[02:00:00]  Yeah  What's the other song on there?  Do you have that Paul Anka CD up there?  Yeah  Dedicated song  The problem is there's no humor involved  In the Paul Anka stuff  Yeah it's not funny  And there's a couple songs on there  You should do one of his songs  Yeah he shouldn't be doing it  Oh do a Paul Anka song  You should do a version of one of his old songs  Having My Baby  You should do a version of one of his old songs  Having My Baby  Or you should fuck him like an animal  Having My Baby  Thank you  Let's uh  But I just found out he sold  Now don't play his fucking CD while I'm here  Just read the titles  We wouldn't play his CD  I was going to play it to show you how bad it was  Oh I heard it  It's horrible  I mean it's great  I want to hear his outtake  If you like shitty 
[02:00:30]  Alright no we'll play his outtake  You ever heard Paul Anka yelling at his band  Oh I'd love to hear that  Because that's what I need  That's the ammo I need  To turn the country away from  Because we sold a thousand of our CDs last week  He sold eight thousand in his first week out  Son of a bitch  I know and he took all  You know  Well they got these old Paul Anka fans  That think they're going to get something that they  Richard you sound so angry  I'm bitter  You know what I am  I'm bitter  I'm going to record my own backstage tapes  But I don't yell at the band  I yell at someone else's band  What happened with the keyboard player?  I'll tell you that story  It's a good one  Oh here's the Paul Anka CD 
[02:01:00]  Hold on a second  He did Eyes Without a Face by Billy Idol  Yeah  Which is what we were working on for the next album  He did Love Cats  Which we do  And Black Hole Sun  He stole that  Stephen Eadie did that five years ago  Stephen Eadie did Black Hole Sun  That's right  I forgot about that  Fuck you Paul Anka  Yeah  Hold on  He does Wonderwall by Oasis  You know any of those Bobby?  Yeah  Screw him  Screw Bobby  Yeah  No I'm just kidding  I love you Bobby  But now what happened?  You had a falling out  Well the  Because I noticed it's a whole new band  The first keyboard player 
[02:01:30]  He left because he was married  And his wife was in Chicago or something  And he was too far away  So he moved home  So we let him out  So I got this new guy  We auditioned this new guy  His name was  I don't want to say his name  But it rhymes with Gorin  Okay  And he showed up in the band  And he was slick  And he was cool  And he did a couple shows with us  And then one day  You know we've got like ten shows booked in August  And in July  He calls me and goes  Hey man  Gordon do your impression of his voice  Yeah because we're all going to know 
[02:02:00]  Yeah it's funny  I don't know  He goes  Hey man listen  I got a gig with Hillary Duff's band  I got to go  I got to  I'm going to be his touring  You know their touring musician  I got to  I can't turn it down man  I'm like  Okay well  You know I got twelve gigs booked  What are you  What am I supposed to do?  So he just left  And he also  Got paid for his last gigs  And I didn't have to pay him  And I paid him all his gigs  Why did you pay him?  I thought he was going to reimburse me  For the airfare  For the gigs that we had booked 
[02:02:30]  He didn't do a damn thing  Look at the tension going on  I'm telling you  In the lounge against the machine  But luckily  As soon as he did  We got this new guy Bobby  Yeah  Whose name also Bobby Ricotta  Total coincidence  And he's really good  And he's on time  And he hasn't bailed on me  For any tours  Is that correct?  Still in the band  Really good  And also  He looks black  Which helps  Well  I think it's more  I'll go Hawaiian  Yeah  Well he is 
[02:03:00]  But if you look in the CD  He totally looks like a brother  And he's like  Giving us so much cred  Cred  Some street cred  Some street cred  So thank you Bobby  For staying in the band  Oh there's the  That's pretty good  Something tells me though  You wield an iron dick  With the band  No I'm not that bad  I think you're  I'm not that bad  I mean  The other bass  The first bass player  He might have  Done something with a girl  In a hotel room in Vegas  Oh well  That might have not been  To her liking  Ah  Jesus  Alright  Some bad room service 
[02:03:30]  I would assume  No no  It was  I don't want to talk about it  Because I think I'm not allowed to  But he had to go  He had to go  It was him or the band  Going to jail  You know when those allegations  Rear their ugly heads  Sometimes you just got to  Cut your ties  Or the band going to jail  That's what you want to hear  The band and the whole  Richard Cheese thing  Going into the tab  Wow  That would be  Actually it would probably be good  You could put out  A prison album like Johnny Cash  Lounge Against the Machine  And Cell Block D  Play in a prison 
[02:04:00]  If someone over at Rikers  Could just book us  There you go  That would be a pleasant gig  I got fucked up the ass last night  I read an article  Hold your repertoire  Those guys in Rikers  And God bless them  I'm sure that they're all  On drug busts  Which are totally stupid  They use their own feces as a weapon  Right  I have heard this  That is a sweet  How do they do it though?  They put it in their mouth  And spit it at the guards  Nice  I'm so serious 
[02:04:30]  Why would you have to  Put it in your mouth?  Couldn't you just throw it at the guards?  Well I think they want the propulsion  And the surprise factor  A lot of surprises  Coming out of his mouth  Yeah  Yeah you might  If the guy raises his hand  And wind up  You might be able to  Duck out of your way  But if you're just looking  At some guy in the face  And going hey  Hey boy  Oh of course  It's like 1920s  On a chain gang  What am I doing?  Hey boy  What you doing in there boy?  What we have here  Is a mouth full of feces  And he just spits it out at you 
[02:05:00]  Now you got trouble  Right?  That's dedication  That is dedication  To the act right there  Remember that great song  By Pat Benatar  Give me an B  Oh a B  Stop using shit as a weapon  Thank you  I'll be here all week  Paul Anka's gonna record that tomorrow  Fucking Paul Anka  Comes out with a CD  The week after mine  He sells eight times as many CDs  And he's online  Fuck Paul Anka  I'm calling Letterman's show  Every week for six months  Hey you gotta have us on  We're funny  Dave will like us 
[02:05:30]  The whole Letterman band loves us  Will Lee  Yeah  Plays on our fucking CD  Really?  He played bass on American Idiot  So I call up the booker  And I'm like  Hey we do lounge versions  Of contemporary rock songs  And they go  Oh yeah Paul Anka's on  This Wednesday doing that  Son of a bitch  How about going to Jay Leno?  Ah Jay Leno  Very very funny man  Uh oh  Oh wait  No I won't do that show  Oh boy  Now that's Jimmy's favorite  It's loyalty  Jimmy was just on Jay Leno  Jimmy Norton  Jimmy Norton is very  He was just on like two days ago 
[02:06:00]  On Monday actually  Was that his first time on there  Or second time?  Second time  And then he sat down with Jay  And had a great long conversation  Cracking the audience up  And making pedophile remarks  About Hilary Duff  Who was sitting next to him  Hilary Duff coming up a lot today  Look Hilary Duff  What is with Hilary Duff?  She's on the Regis  And what the hell is that girl's name?  Generally Harrison  I don't know which one of the Janits  Or Chrissies that she is  I don't know  Which twin were you in that TV show?  That is an excellent Regis 
[02:06:30]  I love it  That's a very good Regis  Well it is  You've got to just plug your nose  And yell at everything  I do an impression of Edward G. Robinson  I'd like to do for everybody right now  It's from the movie Key Largo  Can I have a drum roll there Frank?  Alright let's hear this  Edward G. Robinson  Addressing Humphrey Bogart's character  Who formerly served in the military  Edward G. Robinson about to be shot  But he knows  So he's trying to cut a deal  With the character  And here he goes  Soldier  Soldier  Soldier 
[02:07:00]  Thank you  I'll be here all the way  Wow  I felt like I was there  Wow  I had my eyes closed  And it was just like it  It sounded like Richard Cheese  Doing a bad Edward G. Robinson  Why isn't Hilary Duff on our show?  She's doing the press junket in New York  She's doing everything  She looks good  She sure does  She's lost all her weight  Hey let's go to the phones Anthony  Because we were talking about shit  And Jeremy has something here  Jeremy in Jersey  Go ahead  I love this show  Hey what's up boys  God the piano playing in the background  Just mellows us all out  I love it 
[02:07:30]  Keep it going  Keep it going  Nice  Go ahead Jeremy  Hey listen  You've got to get a recording  Of that shit dick song  So you can cover that  Next time he comes in  The shit dick song?  Have you heard the shit dick song?  No I'd love to hear that song  We have the shit dick song  We haven't played this one  In a very long time  Is it about ass fucking?  You think you guys  Could work up a version of this?  If in a few minutes  Sure  Our faithful listeners  Would just love you  We've got time this morning  Love you  Can we get some headphones  For my good friends  Bobby, Frank and Gordon  Wow that would be  Are you insane?  That would be lovely 
[02:08:00]  Are you kidding me?  It's uh  Yeah  It's a work in progress  Still a radio station?  This is uh  I had trouble getting my own headphones  That's how they are around here  You've got pop script  Oh wait  These guys want to hear the song  Is what you're saying  Well they're going to need to hear it  At some point  No we can do it  We can play it  We'll turn off all the mics  And then it'll be on the studio  In the studio  Okay that's good  And then maybe you guys  Leave the studio  And try to work up a quick version  And our  Bobby's so good  He could probably write it up  In a spot  Here's shit dick  You want to explain shit dick Anthony  It's from  Oh there's um  Panzerfaust records 
[02:08:30]  Panzerfaust records  They have disbanded  Yeah  Because there were partners  That ran Panzerfaust records  And one of the partners  Found out that the other partner's mother  Was Hispanic  Uh huh  And since Panzerfaust is a white supremacist label  Right  Uh this kind of shook up the corporate world over there  At Panzerfaust  A little bit  Which is really funny  When you think the guy probably was so nervous  Keeping this secret for so long  Yeah  Uh Panzerfaust  Yeah  Uh Eric  We're going to need someone to get the lyrics for these guys 
[02:09:00]  Immediately  That'd be great  They got to transcribe  They only handled white supremacy  Uh uh racist homophobic uh bands  That would sing these songs  And uh this song Shit Dick  Uh huh  Is about the homosexual community  And some of the um  Some of the celebrities  Uh uh that are homosexual  This is perfect  And how this guy feels about them  I'm looking for new material  For our new Greatest Six record  See and this is something  I don't think Paul Anka is going to cover  This could be one of those B-side things  That some of these artists do  That really takes off  One of those obscure songs 
[02:09:30]  That you just happen to have  Let me tell you about Paul Anka  The hidden track  That's not listed  I'm very angry about Paul Anka  Don't say it  Don't say it  No  Because it totally angers me  You just said it  Oh fuck  The P word  The P word  It is the P word  We have audio of Paul Anka  Losing his mind  We'll play for it  I can't wait  Because I can put that on my website  And say don't support  Yeah listen to this guy  This raving lunatic  We'll give you a copy  He yells at his band  Like they're animals  There's a Great Buddy Rich  Recording  Yeah  The Great Buddy Rich  Doing that on a bus  And I love that track  Because he uh  He says  You fucking guys 
[02:10:00]  I could  I could play better shit  Out of my ass  And you hear a bus  Engine  Through the whole tape  It's so good  You hear that  It's so good  Alright here we go  For Richard Cheese  And the band  This is one of our faves  We're always trying to  Find ways to play this  We always try to find  An excuse to play  This lovely little ditty 
[02:10:30]  Shit dick  We hate all  Shit dick  Andy Warhol  Shit dick  Mick Jagger  Shit dick  Michael Jackson  Shit dick  Jeffrey Dahmer 
[02:11:00]  Cannibal  Shit dick  We hate shit dick  But slamming shit dick  Boy George  Shit dick  Freddie Mercury  Shit dick  David Bowie  Shit dick  Rob  Alfred  Judas  Free  Shit dick 
[02:11:30]  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Rock Hudson  Shit dick  Liberace  Shit dick  Tim  Neighbors  Shit dick  Albert  England  Freddy Krueger  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Shit dick  Truman Capote Shintech! Richard Simmons Shintech! Rod Stewart Shintech! Richard Gere Punch Turbillain Shintech! 
[02:12:00]  We ain't so fuck you Shintech! But fuck you Shintech! You're 660!  God damn it! I love that song! That is so good! We love that thing! We haven't played that in a long time! 
[02:12:30]  That's really good! Yeah, we can work up a little- You can work up a version of that Richard?  You know, loungeify it, give it a little more swing class. Richard Gere, butt gerbillin' shit dick.  We don't have to do it now. I don't have the lyrics yet, but let's tease the quarter hour.  The lyrics are star studded. What we'll do is we'll take a break in a little while.  The band, you know, leave the studio, you work it up a little bit, maybe hear the song again in Steve's studio,  and then we'll come back and do that. Yeah, we'll totally do that. That's good.  Hey, uh, Puck, where are you getting those lyrics?  Just typed them up. You just typed those up? 
[02:13:00]  On the fly. From memory?  I think you missed a couple, but he did a very good job.  That's very cool. I'd like to volunteer to do the fart noises.  Yeah, that'd be awesome. There you go.  But we need you to do them not just like the original song.  You need to sort of lounge your fart noises out.  All right. Let more lounge your fart noises.  And by the way, as a song guy, I think, and by the way, what a great title for myself, Song Guy.  That is a really well-constructed song. Isn't that good?  Because they didn't just repeat shit dick over and over again and throw names in there.  They built a real song. They had a verse, and then there was a bridge, and then there was a turnaround, and there was a refrain. 
[02:13:30]  And then they did that double time with the call and answer.  Right, right.  That's a great song. Isn't it good?  What's the name of the artist?  Who did that? We just know they were on Panzerfaust records.  I'd love to find out.  A little racial problem.  Every time we sing a song, you know, we play royalty.  Yeah.  Well, Panzerfaust was an anti-tank weapon that the Nazis used to use back in the day.  And by the day, I mean the 40s. 
[02:14:00]  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  Back in the good old days.  When we was hanging in Poland and shit.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  We was blitzkrieging all over the Europe.  Don't be.  Yeah.  I don't ever laugh when I do these radio shows because all the rest of the DJs in the United States suck.  And you guys are funny.  Richard, thank you so much.  You don't even know because I'm on a hundred radio stations all the time.  Only imagine.  We were just on Z100. 
[02:14:30]  And those guys are sweet.  I know these people for a long time.  But it's regular radio too.  It's regular radio.  They're not hilarious like this.  It's so very nice.  We hope we can ruin it for regular radio.  Yeah.  I hope so.  Did they play shit dick?  Oddly enough, they did.  But it was Shakira's version of it.  Let me tell you though.  That is sexy.  It's sexy because, you know, music is an entity unto itself.  I'm quoting Shakira out of the USA today.  Remind me, speaking of Panzerfaust, I also have a Nazi record label story about my old label that I want to tell you guys later. 
[02:15:00]  Really?  You think I hate Paul Anka.  Well, we've got Paul Anka clips for you.  Oh, I can't wait.  I've got to tell you about my old record label, Oleo Records.  Let me get that spelling right.  Oleo?  The slander and libel suit can be very accurate.  Why have I heard of Oleo Records?  Who else was on there?  They put out a lot of independent stuff.  They put out the Richard Blaine flashback.  With Jackie Martling?  Yeah, Jackie Martling was on Oleo Records.  I remember him always hawking his wares.  Let me tell you a little story about that label.  Do we have time now?  Sure.  What time is it in real time, by the way?  Do we have time? 
[02:15:30]  It is five minutes.  Now, if we save the time during the replays, it is about six minutes to the hour.  To the hour.  To the hour.  And there's no Arbitron, is there?  And there's no commercials.  We just stop when we want to stop.  I love you guys.  There's no nothing.  There's no ratings.  There's no accountability.  Right.  There's no nothing.  There's just XM's money.  I was just thinking of Paul, we've got to get into that five-minute till break.  No.  We can get into the news at the top of the hour and do the legal ID.  Hatred of shit, dick. 
[02:16:00]  Oh man, I love this.  Wow.  Hatred of shit, dick.  Well, the old record label, when I first did this Richard Cheese album, this first label  bought my first CD for $7,000.  That's what they paid.  Seven cheese?  Seven grand to record the entire album.  Seven large.  To get teen songs for seven grand.  $500 or less per song.  Now, at the time, were you psyched, thinking, hey, I'm making money with my music?  I'm thinking I'm going to be on a record deal.  I'm going to have CDs in every store. 
[02:16:30]  I'm thinking this is going to be here tonight.  Right.  I did the whole album with just a couple of guys and musicians, and it worked out great.  He put the thing out.  This is day to boo, by the way.  Yeah, I know.  I was about to...  Go ahead.  No, no, no.  You go.  You first.  And then we'll tell the exact same story.  Oh, good.  Well, it gets so much worse than I think any other horror story I've heard in the music  industry.  So, he put out the CD, and it sold maybe, you know, 5,000 copies, and he just stopped  doing anything about it.  I go out there, and I start working it.  I come into New York.  I go on the O.B. & Anthony show when it was on FM. 
[02:17:00]  Those were the days.  And then we sold CDs, and we were promoting, and it was great.  And then he calls me up and says, hey, we'll do a second record.  We'll do your second record for the option.  Uh-huh.  Now, my contract said the option was 15,000 for the next record.  All right.  Great.  15 grand.  I'm making double as much.  I can do it twice as good an album.  And he goes, no, but I'm only going to give you 7,000 for the second record.  I said, but the contract says 15,000.  Did he pull the legal term contract schmontract?  He did.  It was so much better than that. 
[02:17:30]  It's hard to get out of.  He said, I know, and my lawyer said to him, argument?  And he said, argument schmargument.  That's what happened.  God, I hate that legal jargon.  I know.  So he said, no, I'm only going to pay you $7,000.  Take it or leave it.  And I said, but the contract says you have to pay me 15,000 if you exercise the second option.  I said, you know, he said, well, then I won't exercise the second option.  And he walked away.  Release me from the contract.  I'm like, okay, fine, you asshole. 
[02:18:00]  Then I'll go put out my own CDs.  So I put out toxicity, my own CD.  And it went well.  Thank you.  I said to him, look, I'm going to put out my own CDs.  Are you cool with that?  And he said, sure.  He said, I'll write you a letter that says you're free and clear.  Uh-oh.  He writes me a letter.  You can use Richard Cheese.  You can say the name.  You can run the whole CD and do what you want without obligation.  So I put out toxicity.  Great.  I put out I'd like a virgin.  I'd like a virgin.  I'm holding this up for the radio audience, by the way.  I see that.  I have two CDs out there independent.  And I'm thinking to myself, you know what? 
[02:18:30]  RichardCheese.com is his website right now.  I should own that.  Absolutely should.  Who should have OpieandAnthony.com?  Well, we had a fight for our website.  Yes, we did.  You did?  It took a good year.  And you won, right?  Yeah.  Because you can't fucking not be Opie and Anthony and own it.  An anti-fan had the site.  I'm kind of getting some thing here because I see your website as I love RichardCheese.com.  RichardCheese.com.  Exactly.  And not just RichardCheese.com.  And you can't imagine how much I enjoy saying those extra two syllables a hundred times a  day. 
[02:19:00]  And people coming up to me going, hey, can I go to your website, RichardCheese.com?  I go, no, don't go to RichardCheese.com because he set up his website.  By the way, I love Bobby playing beautiful, lovely music behind my horrible legal nightmare.  He has RichardCheese.com just selling the first CD and no information about my other CDs.  Now you don't get it.  It's nice of you to plug it for him.  Do you get any money?  I barely get any money from that CD.  Yeah.  And so anyway, I've been fighting him to get RichardCheese.com back.  And I said, look man, I'm Richard Cheese.  Right.  You told me it was okay for me to put out Richard Cheese CDs. 
[02:19:30]  I have a trademark on Richard Cheese now.  Maybe you should shorten your name to Dick.  Well, I got DickCheese.com.  Oh, you got DickCheese.com right?  DickCheese.com.  I called this porn guy in Florida who owned DickCheese.com.  And I said, hey man, look, you're not using it.  It just forwards to CyberFoxes.com.  If you pull up CyberFoxes.com, pull up DickCheese.com on there and look what comes up.  Opie, read that if you see it.  DickCheese.com.  I love this guy.  He was so nice.  I don't have BenBailey.com.  I had to use the real BenBailey.com.  See?  BenBailey could be another guy. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, this is a British, some guy in England.  This is so great.  This is hilarious.  You go to DickCheese.com, Anthony.  It says, welcome to DickCheese.com.  If you're looking for lounge singer Richard Cheese, click here.  If you're looking for top-notch explicit internet porn, click here.  I split this DickCheese.com with this porn guy.  He was so nice.  That's hilarious.  That is pretty cool because now two people are sharing the same link page.  That's right.  And he gets my traffic and I get his.  Isn't that great how you're working together?  We work together. 
[02:20:30]  Exactly.  We play We Are The World for this.  Hold on.  This is a tough decision though, Richard.  It's like, do I go to the lounge singer Richard Cheese or get top-notch explicit porn?  I don't know which one to do.  I guarantee you everyone does the porn first.  They go right to the porn page and they get the rocks off.  What was I doing again?  Richard Cheese.  I've got a couple extra minutes.  I've got to click on this.  Richard, our story really fast, we put out a CD called Demented World.  Uh-huh.  Sold well over 100,000 copies.  Oh my God, that's great. 
[02:21:00]  We maybe saw 10 grand each, maybe.  We got so roped on this.  Maybe.  I don't even think we saw that much, right?  No, no.  And then the guy decided to stop.  Well, go ahead.  He decided to stop paying us at all.  Wow.  All of a sudden, all these CDs are out there.  He just stopped paying us.  And know why he decided to stop paying us?  Because we were bitching on the air for a year that we weren't getting paid.  We weren't getting paid.  So we started bitching about on the air.  He finally calls us up and goes, I heard you bitching about me on the air.  He said, yeah, well, we haven't been paid.  He goes, well, you know what? 
[02:21:30]  Now you're not getting paid.  Oh my gosh.  But he stopped paying us.  So you're not going to pay us?  Even though you haven't been paying us, now you're really not going to pay us.  These shysters.  Please tell me you've sued him.  No.  Why not?  You can get a lot more dough out of that.  I'll sue him for you.  You know what I say?  Sue Shmoo.  I went to high school with her, by the way.  Huge tit.  Some Asian girl.  She was beautiful and quite a slut.  We knew that we were in trouble with this guy, Richard.  Sue Shmoo.  He was representing Bozo the Clown. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  But not the original Bozo.  That's a big contract.  Not the original Bozo.  Not the original Bozo the Clown.  But does he have the real website?  He was trying to be our agent as well.  So he was bragging with these stories of people he knows and things he's done in his past.  He actually told us a story.  You know the song Na Na Na Na Hey Hey?  Sure.  Do you know who sings that?  I do.  It's a very obscure band.  It's got an S in it.  Yeah.  One Hit Wonder.  Water Vapor.  Sweet or... 
[02:22:30]  Sweet or...  Steam.  No, no.  Steam, that's right.  It is Steam.  He claims that he...  Wait, I think I got...  It's Steam.  Very good.  Is it A?  Steam.  This guy who wanted to be our agent...  What is?  Steam.  ...was telling us that he was in the studio while this band was doing this song but they  didn't have a name.  Uh huh.  And he saw...  He saw Steam.  And it was this long stupid manager agent type story where they go into these long winded  things.  It takes forever.  So I saw Steam coming out of the radiator and I said why not call the band Steam. 
[02:23:00]  And they went what a great idea and as we know the name of the...  Shut up.  I was with a manager one time and he's telling us this long story about how this other manager  he was with, they were fighting over clients all the time and this one manager turned down  this one client and he signed her to a contract on a napkin, a cocktail napkin in a bar and  they signed the contract and do you know who that artist was? 
[02:23:30]  And now we have to...  Now it's a game.  We gotta sit...  Um...  Uh...  Heart?  No.  Uh...  Pat Benatar?  No.  Yeah.  Panzerfaust.  No.  And you're just sitting there going could you just say this so I could go home?  Oh, that's awesome.  That artist was Cindy Lauper.  Oh my god.  Wow.  Wow.  That's fantastic.  How about that.  I love that.  I heard Scott Shannon this morning on the PLJ doing a story about which... 
[02:24:00]  Which starlet has herpes?  Ooh.  They were doing the mystery question of the day.  The answer is D, all of the above.  Yes.  That's an interesting one.  But I was just like, wow, Shannon is getting...  Get the post.  That's the blind item in the post today.  They had a couple good ones.  They had a couple good ones.  Exactly.  They had a couple good ones today.  And then the same guy was trying to get us to sign a five year contract in the middle  of a food court in a mall.  With a big...  Because he wants another story for next time.  With a big...  And I was in a food court and I signed it on a root beer napkin.  I signed and that was Opie and Anthony.  He brought...  And remember he brought his muscle with him? 
[02:24:30]  That big scary black dude?  Yeah.  Brought a big black guy with him.  It was almost like you will sign this contract.  That's awesome.  Anyone could sit in an expensive office.  I use food courts and pass the savings on to you.  How many people can close a deal in front of the Shinnebun?  By the way...  Try the chicken chow mein here.  It's wonderful.  To finish the story...  Only the free samples.  The reason we were in the food court...  When your food has toothpicks stuck through it.  Yeah.  You know, you're dining inside.  Look, hors d'oeuvres.  To finish the food court story... 
[02:25:00]  We put out this Dementor World CD, Richard.  And we toured.  We kind of toured the CD.  We went to...  Signings everywhere.  All over Massachusetts.  We were...  We went on that mall tour.  Right, right.  We went to all these malls and record stores and...  No joke, there was a few that...  We were there all day.  Six, seven hour signings.  Unbelievable.  And we're just thinking...  Ka-ching, Ka-ching in our heads.  Because we weren't making any money.  And this is like...  We're finally gonna make some cash for...  You know...  With what we do.  So...  He wasn't paying us.  And we finally meet in the mall at the food court.  And now he's gonna give us some of the money. 
[02:25:30]  He's gonna give us our checks.  So now we're like...  On the way there, me and Opa are going...  This is great.  Finally we're gonna get money.  This motherfucker better have ten grand...  At least ten grand each for us.  And that would only be maybe...  You know...  Part of the money.  Part of the money.  And it's like...  At least...  For ten grand each.  Uh-huh.  This guy was like selling t-shirts and posters...  And counting the cash in the back corner.  Oh, man.  Oh, it was all cash.  He'd sell these posters and t-shirts...  We didn't see one dime.  And be in a corner.  And you'd just see his arm moving in here.  And you know he's not jerking off.  He's out... 
[02:26:00]  Just wads of cash.  And we never saw a dime one.  Looked up every once in a while.  Keep it up, boys.  Keep it up.  Keep going, boys.  Keep going, guys.  Good work.  His big green stained thumb.  Thumbs up.  Yeah, you son of a bitch.  He's got pictures of like friggin' Benjamin Franklin on his thumb from Counting Hundreds.  Oh, man.  We were just happy to be there because, you know, I mean, this is huge exposure.  Sure.  The CD kind of went all over the country, not, you know...  I mean, but a few here, a few there all over the country.  It was exciting, you know?  Yeah.  So we had nothing?  He didn't have a check for anything?  Oh, he had a check. 
[02:26:30]  I think it was for a grand each.  A grand each, yeah.  One thousand dollars each.  He slides it in the envelope like a big money deal's going down.  Like a ransom for a hostage thing is sliding back.  A suitcase of cash.  And a thousand bucks he slides up.  And we are like, this son of a bitch.  And he wanted to sign us at that moment.  You know, hey, guys, here's the contract.  It's a five-year deal.  Like, dude, you just stiffed us and we're gonna now sign with you?  Which item from the food court do you get a thousand dollars every six months? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, every six months.  I know.  I was ready to take my, uh, dry veggie burger.  Yeah, who knows what it was, but...  I went to high school with her, too.  Oh, dry veggie burger.  Big tits.  Asian.  Thank you, Asian.  All right, so where are we at?  We got the Paul Anka clips for us.  Oh, I want to hear Paul Anka.  You guys want to hear Paul Anka clips.  Listen to this scumbag.  Paul Anka just losing his mind.  How he treats his band.  You guys might have flashbacks.  Sorry, here we go.  Paul Anka yelling at his band.  The light at times of your life.  What is that blue doing over there on, all the way to the middle, and then you shut  it off? 
[02:27:30]  What is that all about?  That was a fuck up.  That was a fuck up.  If I see that again, you're gone with the rest of them.  Is that clear?  Mm-hmm.  That's just the way it is around here.  You understand that?  That's how fucking crucial this is.  That's how fucking crucial this is, is my new catchphrase.  That's how fucking crucial this is.  Guy had his aunt in the wrong setting?  Yeah.  It was something, uh...  You got to turn to the middle.  Yeah, what are you doing?  It was actually something to do with, um, I guess the way, uh, the lights he was pissed 
[02:28:00]  at.  I don't remember on that one.  He was pissed at the way they came in and out of songs.  And he threatens their jobs.  Well, here's the one where he puts them on fucking notice.  Oh.  You thought, you thought, you thought, you thought eight things tonight.  You're on fucking notice, John.  I gave you a list.  You had half a list that I gave you.  We're choosing everything on it.  Okay?  The guys get shirts.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  The guys get shirts.  You understand?  We're not going to be as strong as our weakest link.  The guys get shirts. 
[02:28:30]  The guys get shirts.  The guys get shirts.  Shirts.  He's upset about the shirts.  The guys get shirts.  The guys get shirts.  The guys get shirts.  I chewed out Frank for losing one of our tiger stripe ties.  But he found it.  Yeah.  And everything's fine.  He's still in the band.  Did you chew him out, though?  I didn't say that it was that fucking crucial.  You're on fucking notice, buddy.  You're on fucking notice.  But yeah, your guys wear ties.  God, that's awesome.  This one's really good.  Listen to this clip.  Now, guys, I'm giving you all one week to get this together.  Okay?  I'm giving you one week to play that music the way it's supposed to be. 
[02:29:00]  I'm giving everybody one week.  Everybody's got one week to do it right.  Because I'm in my form right now.  If you guys are not going to come up and support me with the enthusiasm I've got for it,  it ain't going to work.  I'm going to important one on that stage.  And you are letting me down.  Do you understand that?  I don't get it. 
[02:29:30]  I don't get it.  Do you understand that?  I'm the only important one on that stage.  Oh, that's it.  He's the only important one.  I need to start being an asshole.  See?  That is why he sold 8,000 CDs last week, because he's an asshole.  And that's the secret.  Doesn't that sound like a lot of fun, though?  Oh, man.  Just getting up in front of a group of people that are supporting you and just treating them like shit.  Oh, boy.  That is great.  Well, I'm staying in this business.  That's a fun guy to work with.  Y'all of us just be touring around with Paul Anka, shirtless. 
[02:30:00]  Well, we have one more clip.  Go ahead.  One more clip worth playing, because he asked them if they like their jobs.  Now, we're all important to him to the power.  If you don't care like I care, I don't need you guys to take my money.  Just like that guy last night that fucked up my crew and was short labor.  I lost out 20 or 30 fucking thousand dollars because my crew got fucked.  Do you understand?  Do you understand where I'm coming from with integrity?  And you guys are better at the same thing.  Because you're all replacing them.  Do you all like your jobs?  Do you want your jobs?  Do you? 
[02:30:30]  Then you better protect his.  Because if that happens again, he does not have that job anymore.  Do you understand?  And you better make it right.  The band gets shirts.  The guys get shirts.  You don't know how crucial this is.  Do you fucking like your job?  Wow.  See, I like that.  Do you fucking like your job?  I like the new Richard Cheese.  Well done.  I love Richard Cheese.  My crew fucked me for 20 or 30 thousand dollars.  Do you not understand integrity?  Right. 
[02:31:00]  I think I got it.  I think I got it.  That's good.  Thank you Paul Inca for giving me a reason.  You could go off with that Hillary Duff bitch.  Oh jeez.  Use that one.  I actually did yell at him.  You did?  That was good.  But he's out of the band.  You can yell at him as you're firing him.  You want to hear Slice Like a Hammer?  This one's pretty good too.  Oh absolutely.  We have millions of them.  This will be the last one I guess for today.  There's a lot of loose shit going on and I'm telling you, you guys are on thin ice.  Alright?  I'm telling you right now.  And when I fucking move, I slice like a fucking hammer. 
[02:31:30]  Have you seen it?  I'll do it again.  When I tell you the band, you better look and make sure everybody's here when you walk  in this room.  I will not put up with this shit.  You understand that?  Oh man.  That's just the fucking weight it is.  Every one of your fucking checks cash with the amount on it.  Do any of your checks bounce?  Do y'all get full value on your money?  I want full value on your fucking service.  Do you hear me?  Oh wow.  What a scumbag.  I love it.  He slices like a hammer.  Like a hammer.  When I move, he'll fucking pound you like a pair of scissors. 
[02:32:00]  That's what I use.  It's like a restaurant.  You know what?  When I get a nice filet mignon at a restaurant, I use a fork and a hammer.  I just kind of, and it slices.  Polanka's right.  I never thought it would work.  I used to watch SCTV and there was a character on The Days of the Week called Rocco and he was  this dumb hit man and he'd go, yeah I'm crazy.  Crazy like a snake.  It's bad idiom.  We failed to consider the possibility that maybe the band is just awful.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:32:30]  We're sticking up behind the band.  Maybe they were really bad.  Just fucking everything up.  He really legitimately has a reason to yell at them.  It's a bunch of like 12 year old kids in a high school or junior high band sitting there  in their briefs.  They pull back and he's yelling at all these kids in an orchestra.  Kids are crying.  Junior high.  I like his lichés that he uses too.  When you sit there and you're yelled at a guy that's saying, you're on thin ice and we're  only as strong as our weakest link.  It's like you're getting clichés thrown at you.  Oh man.  Stop it.  A bird in the fucking hand is worth two in the bush. 
[02:33:00]  I have no idea what that means, Paul.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  Well get your shirt.  Get your shirt.  You know, a shirt has two sleeves and a neck hole.  And you could all be leaving out of one of them.  Some of them have buttons too.  They have buttons.  And I'm buttoning down this stage show and trying to make as many shirt references.  You know, don't make me collar you and...  Those checks are cash for the amounts that are written on them.  Legal tender.  Not a penny more. 
[02:33:30]  Not a penny less.  God, that is awesome.  I am so relieved.  Because you know, when I came in here this morning, I was thinking, I hate Paul Inca.  I hate Paul Inca.  But now, I feel sorry for him.  Don't you feel sorry for him, man?  And now it's okay.  He's such a tool.  He's been riding over here thinking, I hate Paul Inca.  I hate Paul Inca.  I hate Paul Inca.  The whole time.  I hate Paul Inca and I hate Oleo Records.  I hate Paul Inca.  I hate Oleo Records.  Now you can vent.  This is addicting, though.  We've got to play another one now.  Oh, please.  He talks about Jesus Christ in this.  Oh, Jesus.  The only satisfaction I'm going to get is to lean your fucking asses like the coach 
[02:34:00]  of a ball team or any goddamn business until you get it.  Do you understand that?  Because if you don't feel embarrassed about it, and you have no conscience, you've got  no heart, you've got no integrity, do you understand that?  Then all you do is you take the fucking money and you've got no substance.  Remember that.  People of substance and character care about what the fuck they do when they fix it.  Okay?  And I think you're working with me because I think that's the way you are.  And I don't pull any punches with you guys.  I am telling you that his job is on thin ice. 
[02:34:30]  And you know how fast I move.  I don't care if you're a light man, a production manager, an agent, or a theater owner like  last night.  Do you understand?  I have a new philosophy.  I don't care if it's Jesus Christ.  He'll fire Jesus Christ.  This guy will fire Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Remember when Jesus Christ got fired that time.  I'm sad.  I don't care if it's Jesus Christ.  It was so awful because he was always late and he'd use that excuse about the subway  You know the saddest part is watching Jesus at unemployment, sitting there with the woman  going, did you try to be the savior today? 
[02:35:00]  He showed up at Paul Anka's rehearsal without a shirt.  But he's Jesus.  He doesn't have a shirt.  Jesus hasn't worked since.  I want to know what happened between Paul Anka and his ball coach.  Yeah.  He had to ream your ass like a ball coach.  Like a ball coach in sixth grade.  That makes you go home and cry at night.  Curl up in the shower in the fetal position.  His little league coach was fucking him in the ass.  That's why he's such a...  Like a ball coach.  Oh man.  Alright, one more.  We gotta do one more.  We gotta stop.  One more. 
[02:35:30]  Don't make me a maniac.  It hurts my face to laugh.  You don't care like I care.  I don't need you guys to take my money.  Just like that guy last night that fucked up my crew and was short labor.  I lost out twenty or thirty fucking thousand dollars because my crew got fucked.  Do you understand?  Do you understand where I'm coming from with integrity?  I'm coming from with integrity.  Because you're all replacing.  Do you all like your jobs?  Do you want your jobs?  Yeah.  Do you?  It's a little different.  Then you better protect his.  Because if that happens again, he does not have that job.  Do you understand? 
[02:36:00]  And you better make it right.  If you don't do the job, you're gone.  And that goes for everybody.  That's just the fucking way it is.  Because you gotta do good.  And as long as you got it good, you gotta make it good.  Get it fucking right.  That's just the way it is around here.  Do you hear me?  Do you understand that?  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  There you go.  Too late.  There you go.  It sounded like the same clip, but everyone has done it.  When you're arguing, you say the same shit over and over again. 
[02:36:30]  Over and over.  Alright.  That was awesome.  You're a fucking maniac.  Well that solves all my problems, because if I can get that recording out there, I think  that'll dip into his sales and bring up the Richard Cheese CD sales.  Richard, this is what we're gonna do.  Yeah, baby.  He's gonna make me think what the fuck I did over here.  Fucking Paul Anker, you motherfucker.  Keep him here!  Keep him here!  No shirt!  Do you understand where I'm coming from with integrity?  If that came from a mafia boss, everyone should be scared, but it's Paul Anker.  Someone at one of the shows...  What could he actually do?  Well, they refer to him as the bat. 
[02:37:00]  The bat?  Because he looks like a bat.  Holy the bat.  Sometimes.  He's got that tux on, and for some reason the collar seems extra high.  Yeah.  He's all tan and dark hair, looks like George Hamilton.  A bat.  A bat.  That's hilarious.  Alright, this is what we're gonna do.  Yeah, baby.  When we get break...  When we get back from break, we'll do shit dick.  We'll do shit dick live with the band.  Yeah, we want you guys to hear it again, just to make sure you got it.  Absolutely.  It seems like you do, but just to make sure.  Absolutely.  But as we go to break, why don't you do another track off your new CD there.  It's ILoveRichardCheese.com. 
[02:37:30]  It's a little tuned by my good friends, Green Day.  Don't wanna be an American idiot.  Don't want a nation under the new mania.  Can you hear the sound of hysteria?  The subliminal mindfuck America.  Welcome to a new kind of tension.  All across the alien nation.  Everything isn't meant to be. 
[02:38:00]  Okay.  TV dreams of tomorrow.  We're not the ones who are meant to follow.  Well, that's enough to argue.  Well, maybe I'm the faggot America.  The subliminal mindfuck America.  For that's enough to argue.  Tequila! 
[02:38:30]  Thank you so much.  Thanks, Owen A.  More with Richard Cheese in just a bit.  Good evening, I'm Richard Cheese, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  M202, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Put down the Playboy magazines.  For God's sake, the band got Playboy magazines.  Yeah, look at them perusing porno.  The band is pleasuring themselves.  Frank, put that down.  Pick up the sticks.  Put down that stick and pick up the other two.  The band gets pants.  Are we ready for shit, Dick?  I think I want to try it.  You know, we just learned this five minutes ago.  Let's play the original song so we get a taste of the original.  Oh, good idea.  Good idea. 
[02:39:00]  You actually know how to do radio.  Very good.  Baby, I used to work in the business.  Yeah.  I used to be a major market flamethrower.  You want to give people the contrast.  I used to say 25 minutes in front of 3 a.m. on Sunday morning.  My shift.  Coming up next, we got Power Line with Brother John, and then Dick Clark's Rockin' Countdown.  I'll be pressing this button for the next seven minutes, and then in about 25 minutes,  I'll check the transmitter log on KZZP. 
[02:39:30]  Holy crap, I forgot about that.  Wow.  Mesa Phoenix.  Remember how to do that?  Remember the transmitter log?  Oh, my God.  And remember you have to do the EBS test?  Yeah.  Remember if you played one commercial, out of order, and you didn't write the exact  time, the traffic lady would come in, and then boom, boom, boom, like that big orange  monster in the Bugs Bunny cartoon?  You missed a spot.  Yeah.  We got to do a make good on this now.  Make good, yeah.  Good bye.  God, I love the radio.  Those were the days.  Here's the original shit dick.  Here's the original song of shit dick, and then we'll give you a little taste of this. 
[02:40:00]  Make sure we got this.  Shit dick!  We hate all shit dick!  Andy Warhol!  Shit dick!  Mick Jagger!  Shit dick!  Shit dick!  We hate all shit dick!  Andy Warhol!  Shit dick!  Mick Jagger!  Shit dick!  Michael Jackson!  Shit dick!  Jeffrey Dahmer! 
[02:40:30]  Get home!  Shit dick!  Oh yeah, that's a little better for me.  It's always important to take a good song and give it that lounge style.  We hate all shit dicks.  We hate all shit dicks.  We hate all shit dicks.  We hate all shit dicks. 
[02:41:00]  Andy Warhol.  Shit dick Mick Jagger.  Shit dick Michael Jackson.  John Molester and shit dick allegedly.  Jeffrey Dahmer, cannibal shit dick.  Butt slamming shit dicks.  Rock Hudson, shit dick.  Liberace, shit dick. 
[02:41:30]  Jim Neighbors, shit dick.  Robert Englund, Freddy Krueger, shit dick.  Fizz fucking shit dick.  We hate the fucking shit dicks.  The fucking shit dicks.  Fuck those shit dicks.  Thank you, shit dick. 
[02:42:00]  I'll be here all week.  Wow.  The highlight of the week right there.  Nice job, boys.  Thank you.  Bravo.  Richard Cheese and the band.  Thank you so much.  That's one of the songs we'll be playing tomorrow night at the Bowery Ballroom.  And it's sold out, unfortunately.  But if we get 500 of your 180 listeners to show up, we'll do a second show.  You know, that has such a different feel than the original.  The hatred is gone when you sing it.  It's still a love song.  It is.  It really is. 
[02:42:30]  They love to hate these people.  It's more a tribute to these people than a condemnation.  Do you know what I'm saying about integrity?  Yeah, absolutely.  The band gets shirts.  I'm doing that all week.  The band gets shirts.  God, that's awesome.  And he had to say it like five times.  He's so great.  No.  The band gets fucking shirts.  Guys, thanks for having us on.  I kind of got to roll.  And I'm not.  Thank you.  We've got to roll out in a few minutes. 
[02:43:00]  We want to wrap it up with one big song for you.  And I got to say this.  And this is all.  Play me some serious schmoozing music there, Bobby.  Oh.  I got to tell you.  And this is me out to the XM listeners who are here today.  Because ten years from now, you're going to go,  Oh, I used to listen to XM when it first started out.  I was one of the first guys to listen to O&A.  And I was there for them.  And you guys, it's so good.  Like the people with the Betamax.  That's right.  You were faithful to that format.  It's just nice to see you guys back on the air.  And I'm not kidding.  If you don't know, the people are listening and believing in you. 
[02:43:30]  Not just the pests, but the people who bought a new Toyota Scion and they got the XM installed.  They are so lucky and grateful that there's an O.P. and Anthony on the show.  Big round of applause for O.P. and Anthony on the show.  Thank you, Richard.  Thank you so much, Richard.  And with that in mind, we'd like to play a song that we've never played live.  A little song by my good friend Slipknot.  Do you think we can swing this one together there, Bobby?  You know, it's O.P. and Anthony.  We want to say something about you, though.  Well, this is a song called People Equal.  Oh, you want to say something to me right now?  Yeah.  Oh, that's fine.  I'm ready.  Play the shitting music together. 
[02:44:00]  You're good, too.  Adam Sandler had this great stand-up act.  I saw him do it at the Improv in like 1987, and he did this whole thing about his girlfriend  being so sweet to him.  She'd say, you know, Adam, I love you.  You're such a nice, tender lover, and I think you're so pretty when you wake up, and you're  so nice to me and sweet, and I just love you.  And he goes, and all I could think of to say with her was, well, you know, you've got great  jugs.  God bless Adam Sandler. 
[02:44:30]  Some people are much better with words.  Let's do that People Equal Shit song.  You know what I'm talking about?  So we're going to go out with another song, so let's get the plugs in.  I love richardcheese.com, Bowery Ballroom tomorrow night.  That's right, but it's sold out.  I appreciate it.  And you'll come back and see us?  Oh, absolutely.  The official house band of the O.P. and Anthony show?  I'll come back Monday.  Nice.  We can have you back Monday.  I'm here.  I'm here until Tuesday.  I'm swinging.  All right.  Richard Cheese back on Monday.  This is exactly where the song starts singing.  Okay, good.  We've never played this live.  World debut.  A little Slipknot song from our new CD, Aperty for Destruction, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:45:00]  Let's see if I remember the lyrics.  Come on down and see the idiot right here.  Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care.  What's the matter with calamity anyway?  Right, get the fuck out of my face.  Understand I can't feel anything.  It isn't like I want to sift through the decay.  I feel like a wound, like I got a fucking gun against my head. 
[02:45:30]  You live when I'm dead.  People equals shit.  People equals shit.  People equals shit.  People equals shit.  Come on.  Come on.  Satan.  One more time, motherfucker. 
[02:46:00]  Everybody hates me now, so fuck it.  Blood on my face and my hands.  I don't know why.  I'm not afraid to die, but that is none of your business.  Overdo it.  Don't tell me you blew it.  Stop your bitchin' and fight your way through it.  I'm not like you.  I just fuck up.  Come on, motherfucker.  Everybody has to die.  People equals shit.  Everybody clap your hands. 
[02:46:30]  People equals shit.  Come on.  People equals shit.  Let me hear ya.  People equals shit.  Everybody sing.  People equals shit.  What you gonna do?  People equals shit.  I'm not afraid of you.  People equals shit.  I'm everything you'll ever be.  People equals shit.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Richard Cheese and the band. 
[02:47:00]  That was so fabulous.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Next.  Ah, Stephen Lynch.  Hard to get him in here in the morning.  Because he's a drunk.  And we actually, this is his second appearance on the show.  And we had to have, like, beer available.  Dude, it was like 7.30 in the morning.  But, he never disappoints.  And he debuted a couple of new songs.  The Nazi song and Satan. 
[02:47:30]  Is that true?  I don't remember the Satan one.  I remember the Nazi song.  I hum it all the time.  Like, go step across my living room.  Is that good enough?  It's the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Bah!  Hey, let's get Stephen Lynch in here, man.  He's been waiting out there a while.  He's drinking beers.  Are they drinking?  Of course he is.  He's some complete drunk.  Yeah.  I don't know who this guy is.  Stephen always could drink.  I remember doing those gigs down at Bar 9.  It was always a drunk fest. 
[02:48:00]  Got an extra mic set up in here and everything.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How many mics are we capable of getting in here?  This is pretty much it, right?  Every case.  18 or 19, Anthony.  Lynch.  Lynch, hey.  Stephen Lynch.  Opium, sweetie.  Opium.  Wait, where am I?  Opium.  Opium.  Opium.  The Opium and Anthony Shaw.  Greatest city in the world.  I am WWF champion.  Champion.  Champion.  Champion.  Madison Square Garden.  From Terranoran.  Greatest city in the world. 
[02:48:30]  Opium.  The Opium, Anthony.  We're finding that for you now, Stephen.  He couldn't say Opium and Anthony.  He thought Opium was one word when we said Opium and Anthony.  Opium.  And Anthony.  Greatest radio.  City in the New York.  Madison Square Garden.  Roman Greco.  Greco-Roman Wrestle.  I Greco-Roman Wrestle champion.  Champion.  Champion.  What a tool.  The Iron Chick.  I love that guy.  What a tool. 
[02:49:00]  His curly shoes.  You never see that style anymore.  That kind of went out.  Yeah.  It's unfortunate.  No one walking around with the curly shoes anymore.  Unless you're getting on a bus in July with a big coat on.  Yeah.  Wires hanging out.  What's that big bulk under his jacket?  Must be the new Sirius unit.  I like bar.  How are the beers, boys?  Delicious. 
[02:49:30]  Yes.  Nothing pizza yet.  Wonderful breakfast.  Cheers.  You guys are going to join us?  It is late.  No, we're like fags now.  Man, we're the worst.  I don't believe that.  If I drank this early.  We haven't had a beer since the show started.  I fall asleep driving home.  You know, just from waking up early.  I'd be on the expressway just causing wrecks.  It's not like the old days.  God, I loved Afternoon Bride.  Damn it.  Those were good times.  Shots and beers and the heroin.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Remember at the end there, lunch had got so out of control, we hired a bartender?  Were you in for that? 
[02:50:00]  Those days?  I didn't know.  We were bringing in mixed rum drinks with umbrellas and straws.  There was a blender going on.  We actually had a bartender that set up every Friday on the old show.  Every Friday.  How we talked Ken Stevens into that.  Like, oh, no, Ken, it's like a bit that we're doing.  But, no, it had nothing to do with the show.  It was not a bit.  It was the fact that we wanted to drink hard liquor at our job in the afternoon.  And then the bartenders started bringing shot girls with them.  We actually had shot girls.  Shot girls walking around.  We were walking around the test tube and we were doing the drinks. 
[02:50:30]  Was there a velvet rope in front of the building?  You're not allowed in.  You're not dressed right.  Yeah.  That was pretty much, we were running a bar.  It was amazing.  I got turned away from the door once.  Oh, did you?  I had too many dudes with me.  You can come and steal with these guys.  Leave those guys outside.  You guys are going back to afternoons, though, right?  I wish.  God, I wish.  Come on.  That's the rumor, but no way.  They want to, you know.  It's a national show now. 
[02:51:00]  It's one of those things where, personally, I would love doing it.  But I also know it's better to do morning drive for a national show.  Well, it was a national show if it was 1780.  We didn't get too far west.  Yeah, that's true.  But we were in, like, Sacramento.  I hope that was accurate.  It was actually, yeah, it was.  It's close, right?  They would get our show at 6 o'clock.  The Jamestown Settlement.  They would get our show at 6 o'clock on the west coast. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, right.  So their drive home is done.  You know, for the people that wanted to sit in their house and listen to us, that was fine.  But we kind of wanted to get the commuter.  So now, morning drive is the one that makes sense.  That makes sense.  That's cool.  It's growing on me, morning driving.  I hate getting up, but it's like I got to do real-life things, like, you know, with mortgage or whatever.  I get it done, actually.  But it's like, I never would have afforded it.  I would get up for $3.  Do you have a mortgage?  Yeah, I just started.  Me, too.  Yeah, it's awesome.  Isn't that amazing?  We should talk later, but interesting. 
[02:52:00]  I'm going today.  I'm going to look at houses today.  You should.  Yes.  And the responsible thing to do is when you have a mortgage and you're getting ready to move,  spend $2.50 the night before and arc a load in your own eye and then walk into work tired.  Because you came on your own face again.  Me, too.  You're a lot alike.  Again.  Lynchy, for you.  This is Arun Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation champion.  Pleasure for me.  To the Anthony and Opium and pleasure to have come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans and hello to all people, to the wrestling today. 
[02:52:30]  And pleasure to have be here.  Iran, the greatest country in the world.  Greatest Iran, Iran, Greco-Roman wrestle.  I just want to say hello.  This is the Arun Sheik, World Wrestling Federation champion, Olympic champion, AAU champion.  And to you people, very, very be happy to talk, to listen to the Opium.  And Anthony, I want to say again, God bless all my wrestling fans and have a good day. 
[02:53:00]  That is what you hear before they saw your head off.  The same fucking voice.  He should be saying that behind a mask with only his eyes exposed.  Rifle pointed at some fat Australian.  Champagne, pleasure to be chopping head off.  I just want to say...  I just want to say pleasure for Arun Sheik to come from all this country in the world, Tehran, Iran, to the New York City, to I do the interview with the Opium. 
[02:53:30]  And Anthony, and I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans.  He's really bad, and then he gets good at the end.  But thank you for paying your taxes.  This is the Arun Sheik, the real all-countrymen from all this country in the world, Tehran, Iran, come to the Big Apple.  And I have a pleasure for me to talk to the Opium and Anthony, greatest radio station in the world. 
[02:54:00]  Greatest radio station.  And you listen to the Opium and Anthony, one of the top stations in the world.  Fucking insurgent.  We have to change that.  The top station, the Bob Edwards.  Bob Edwards, very good.  For me, pleasure to be listening to XM Bob Edwards.  Thank you, greatest station.  Morning's edition.  Very informative.  The greatest one-hour radio program, Bob Edwards. 
[02:54:30]  Pleasure for me to be bored to tears.  Roman Freckle, I hurt my back lifting the new Regal.  Serious portable unit.  I body-slammed serious unit into a car today to install very good fallen foot and crushed curly shoe.  Oh, that's great. 
[02:55:00]  Pleasure.  Pleasure for me.  Champ-oen.  A champ-oen.  I love that.  Opium.  The Anthony and the Opium.  Opium.  Opium show.  God damn, he was great.  You guys want to do some songs?  Oh, I don't know.  Brought your guitar?  Sure.  Why don't we just chat for a while?  Yeah, we can chat.  Yeah.  I think that's all we do.  You know, we don't care.  Yeah, I don't have anything.  Actually, I'm thinking a couple songs from you guys, and then also we're going to do some 
[02:55:30]  more sex talk with this grandma.  Yeah.  Sue Johanson.  She was talking about how to give a good blowjob yesterday.  Table lady.  She's hot.  Yeah, you've seen her on TV.  Yeah.  Isn't it awful?  It's on the Oxygen channel or something?  It's a grandma giving sex advice.  Dirty old bag.  Deep throat.  Deep throat.  Is that the one we did, Eric?  Deep throat.  Questions on swallowing and gagging.  Nice.  And she's got it all wrong.  It's a different one?  Yeah.  Oh, okay, good.  Did you get a track one yesterday?  No, I know that.  Old bag doesn't know how to give a good one.  All right, we'll get a song out of Stephen Lynch, and then we'll get into this, then we'll 
[02:56:00]  do another song from Stephen Lynch, and whatever.  Well, Stephen, I've got to do all his other songs over again now, so we don't have bleeped versions.  Right.  It's so bad, we'll listen to a couple of your songs.  I've got all the old ones with none of the laughs, because you've heard them all already.  Yeah, we'll just sit there.  No laughs, no applause, no nothing.  Hey, that was funny, you guys.  It ends, and we just go, next.  Let's just try to recreate the old days.  Yeah.  You'll never hear that one on this station again.  Oh, wow, here comes the boss running in.  And then we end up playing it a hundred times. 
[02:56:30]  We're too lazy to take that comment out.  All right, Stephen Lynch.  All right, you want to hear a new one?  Yeah, whatever you want to do.  Sure.  All right, I'll try this new one out.  I've only done this one a couple times, so it's a little, uh...  Ooh.  This is a radio exclusive.  Let me see, I'll take these out.  What is that you just put on your guitar?  That clip.  Capo.  That is a capo.  A capo.  A capo.  Champo and capo.  Champo and... 
[02:57:00]  You play guitar like champo and...  Pleasure for me to put this on third fret.  Greatest fret in the world.  Can you hear that?  The guitar?  Very great.  Nice, yeah.  Beautiful.  Taunting.  Hey, now come on.  That's a quote from another song.  It really is.  Taunting.  We're trying to redo it.  We really are trying to redo it.  Okay.  All right.  I'm nervous about this one. 
[02:57:30]  You're the love of my life, but it cuts like a knife.  And I feel that I'm being misled.  See, I'm a little concerned, for I recently learned of the swastika tattoo on your head.  And it makes you smile when you hear Zieg Heil.  You love the smell of a burning cross in the yard.  You do goose-step salutes in your Doc Martin boots. 
[02:58:00]  And you quoted Mein Kampf in our fifth anniversary card.  I think you're a Nazi, baby.  Are you a Nazi?  I think you're a Nazi, maybe.  You keep extensive files on the Nuremberg trials.  And you watch them whenever they're airing.  I guess I should have known when you bought a new bone for your puppies named Goebbels and Gehring. 
[02:58:30]  And you showed up late to our very first date.  I said, how are you?  You said, white power.  Call me paranoid, but I'm not overjoyed.  When you ask me if I want to shower, I think you're a Nazi.  Don't be lying, baby.  Tell me if you're a Nazi.  Are you anti-Zion, maybe? 
[02:59:00]  Your reverie dress is monogrammed S.S.  You hold an annual Tom Metzger bash.  And it makes me irate when you say I look great if I wear a little tiny mustache.  Your social politics say that races don't mix.  And you call it pure blood pollution.  And whenever I'm sad, you say it's not so bad.  For every problem, there's a final solution. 
[02:59:30]  I think you're a Nazi.  Give me an answer, baby.  Are you a Nazi?  You drive a fucking Panzer, baby.  They say that love is blind.  So how could I have guessed?  But then again, I met you at the Wagner Fest. 
[03:00:00]  I know you're a Nazi.  And that's why I'm leaving.  I know you're a Nazi.  Sure is my name is Stephen Lynch.  Bergstein.  That's a Nazi song. 
[03:00:30]  That's a sweet song.  I like it.  That girl sounds nice.  Yeah, that one doesn't go over too well at the colleges.  No?  No.  They get all pissed off.  They get all the humor.  You get how brilliant the references are on that.  What a bunch of dummies.  Of course.  Yeah, I don't think they know who Tom Metzger is.  Of course not.  Goebbels and Gehring.  It's a nice little history lesson and a love song.  All in one.  At the same time.  All in one.  They tell you not to perform that song?  Who?  The colleges?  No, no.  Well, I've only done it twice. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, and you get the looks, right?  Yeah.  I get a lot of...  Ooh.  Fucking little dummies.  That fun little shower line.  I bet they groaned.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Like they never had just legitimate showers.  You can't just take a shower and not get a look.  I was referring to.  There you go.  Come on.  Very lovely.  That's my new one.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  You guys want to do another one?  I like it a lot. 
[03:01:30]  A lot.  I just don't know if Nazis are appropriate to be making fun of.  Good God.  I felt the tension from over there, dude.  Too soon?  No, it is.  It's too soon.  Too soon.  You kidding?  You gave him a hard on, man.  He was brilliant to that one.  It's a good song, but I'd like to have a body count in there.  Yeah, you couldn't fit six million in there?  No?  I don't know if it's a million.  Billion. 
[03:02:00]  I got the optimist's point of view.  You could have went for a trillion.  There we go.  My goodness.  My God, man.  All right, let's do another one from Stephen Lynch, and then we're going to get into the  sex talk with the grandmothers.  Yeah.  Hot.  Another one.  All right.  Let me figure out something here.  There we go.  How about a...  Well, we'll do another new one.  All right.  Fuck it.  I'm just trying to haul all my new shit on you guys.  Why not?  What we're here for? 
[03:02:30]  All right.  Because when you go see, like, you know, Zeppelin or something, if you went to see Zeppelin  when they were actually playing as a band, you wouldn't want him to do the hits.  You'd want him to do, like, stuff you aren't familiar with.  Right.  I hope John Paul Jones is a 20-minute keyboard solo.  Exactly.  Actually, Anthony, I think you'd rather have them do the hits.  Thank you for adding that.  Thank you. 
[03:03:00]  All right.  This is a song of hope.  Oh.  I thought the last one was.  No, this isn't a song of hope.  This is kind of the antidote to the Craig Christ song.  Oh.  It's because I figured since I did a Jesus song, a God-type song, I'd have to give the opposition  equal time.  So that's what this one's kind of about.  All right.  Here we go.  Ever since first man has walked this earth, I have been here 
[03:03:30]  to whisper seeds of doubt and evil thoughts into his ear.  I am the beast, the outcast angel fallen from on high.  I go by many names, but there is one you can't deny.  My name is Satan.  Hi, everybody. 
[03:04:00]  Let me tell you a little bit about myself.  Okay.  Here we go.  My friends all call me old scratch and I am a Capricorn.  My turn-ons are romantic walks and killing the unborn.  I got little devil horns and a little goatee.  Little devil eyes help a little devil see.  Little coven hoots make it kind of hard to ski.  I'm Satan.  Um, Mephistopheles, another name I go by.  My real name is the Elzebub, but you can call me Beals. 
[03:04:30]  I love to watch Fox News and then go club some baby seals.  Then I'll take a bubble bath and drink a Zinfandel, try to wash off that baby seal smell.  Then I'll make a toast to me.  Hey, here's to my hell.  My name is Satan.  To carry on my evil ways, I went and had a son.  And now he makes his living as a singing comedian.  I am in every Zeppelin album. 
[03:05:00]  I'm in all Rush Limbaugh's rants.  I'm the reason that the Boston Red Sox even had a chance.  And if I want to eat your soul, I'll just throw it on the griddle.  Don't need to make a deal.  I don't need to tell a riddle.  And fuck Charlie Daniels.  I don't care if you can fiddle.  I'm Satan.  The devil went down to Georgia.  He was looking for a soul to steal.  Which is fucking bullshit because I would not be caught dead in Georgia.  Okay?  It's like, oh my God.  Thick, thick, thick.  Thick, thick.  I like the new stuff. 
[03:05:30]  You can tell I've been doing a lot of musical theater lately.  That one was very influenced by the Great White Way.  The Great White Way.  What are you working on nowadays?  Well, I just finished my tour and I'm recording the new album this Monday.  And then I'm taking the summer off to try to write some shit.  Then tour again and then I'm doing the...  Well, it doesn't matter what I'm doing in the winter.  Sorry, I just brought that up, actually.  Really?  What are you doing in the winter? 
[03:06:00]  Having a kid?  No, no, no.  No kids.  A show?  A show, yes.  A show.  A show.  What show?  It hasn't been formally announced yet.  Oh, really?  Sounds like somebody got a show on maybe a satellite network.  No, no, no.  Get out!  A stage show.  A stage show, yes.  Is it a revival?  It is not a revival.  It is an adaptation of a hit movie.  Adaptation of a hit movie.  What decade movie?  90s or 2000s. 
[03:06:30]  Either late 90s or early 2000s.  Schindler's List, the musical.  Yes.  He's essential to the war effort.  I auditioned with my Nazi song.  Got the lead.  I pardon you.  I pardon you.  Big brown ring, roundabout tub.  Big brown ranch, roundabout tub.  I like the little boy song.  Why am I standing in shit?  Why am I standing in shit?  Devil in a little red dress. 
[03:07:00]  I like it.  Let's work on it.  I can't even say something.  I can't even say something.  I can't even say something.  I can't even say something.  I can't even say something in my head.  You're awful.  Oh, wow.  You can do it.  No, no.  Oh, go ahead.  Best leave that one alone. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, everybody.  It's Stephen Lynch.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And also, I have herpes.  It's M202, the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah, a little Jimmy Norton in studio with us.  Ooh.  We're about to play Jim Norton on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  What a moment.  It was a huge moment for Jimmy's career.  Ooh.  That was good.  That was awful. 
[03:08:00]  Opie saying Jimmy's on the show and Jimmy just going, ooh.  Way to show excitement for you, huh?  Yeah.  Leno, Jimmy.  You forgot the rest of it where Anthony comes to the conclusion that Jimmy will be leaving  the program in a matter of months and they'll be stuck with Voss as a replacement.  I do go on and on about that whole thing.  I see you making it big and having no option whatsoever but to leave this program. 
[03:08:30]  Please, I'm going nowhere.  And Jimmy, we were very excited for you.  Thank you.  Yeah, extremely excited.  Picture yourselves.  Here's what you are.  Picture yourself.  You're one lung and you're another lung and I am a hard black thing stuck to it.  You got me to snort.  That was my favorite part of Three's Company.  When Chrissy Snow would laugh.  Ah.  That and when Jack would fall over and then get back up.  Unlike on the set of this new program.  And I might have been funny if I didn't say get back up. 
[03:09:00]  Get back up.  You get them back up.  Get back up.  Get back up.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  I know.  And Jimmy was on the Tonight Show last night with Jay Leno.  Did you see it yet?  I watched it last night.  My bets are in.  I give Jimmy six more months on this show.  That's it.  And he's gone.  That's it?  And we lose him.  Yeah.  He's going to be much too big.  The offers are going to come in.  And then we're going to be stuck with this motherfucker who's outside the glass right now. 
[03:09:30]  Then we're buying Rolls Royce off the eBay as Jimmy is propelled to the ultimate stardom  and forgets our names.  Yeah.  We'll be stuck.  Ladies and gentlemen, Rich Voss.  We have a movie premiere coming up.  Rich, I guess we've got to start giving you a lot more respect because we're going to be  losing Jimmy Norton soon.  We're still losing Jimmy.  We're doing our pilot next week.  Wait a minute.  What?  We're doing our pilot next week.  You are.  But, you know, we don't know if it's going to be picked up or anything.  Until you're on the Tonight Show killing like Jimmy did last night. 
[03:10:00]  It was ridiculous.  He sat down with Leno and went back and forth with him for ten more minutes.  And it was just killer stuff.  It was sharp, very funny, and, like, very on the edge for network television.  All right.  Listen, Elliot, exaggeration.  It wasn't terrible.  Elliot, exaggeration.  Elliot, exaggeration.  Elliot, what show were you watching?  He killed.  No, I said he killed.  Too busy bidding on a Sherman tank?  You just picked the worst E name, too.  Elliot.  You should have said Ernie. 
[03:10:30]  First of all, my boy, Earl.  Earl, Earl, Ernie, better than Elliot for what did we learn today.  Remember that.  I'm bidding on a 747.  Oh, you're bidding on a 747.  He killed.  He killed.  I was watching.  I was really happy.  And I'm probably the only comic that called him before and said, good luck, have a good  set, because none of our friends are nice enough to do that kind of stuff.  Of course not.  And he did.  He destroyed.  And you know what?  He was so comfortable.  Yeah.  That's what it was.  He sat down completely comfortable.  Because the B material, when you're that comfortable, you know, B material comes out. 
[03:11:00]  B material, yeah.  It's too bad that the plane lost his luggage and he had to wear that outfit.  But, oh.  Yeah, we got to rag him about that.  What the hell was he wearing?  Bonnie wrote that.  Really?  Good one, Bonnie.  Why don't we talk to Bonnie?  We don't need to talk to you anymore.  That is funny, man.  He came out and he was wearing just a t-shirt and some oversized shirt.  That's his favorite shirt.  He was wearing my shirt.  Unbuttoned.  Yeah.  It was like one of Tyson's shirts. 
[03:11:30]  That's one of his favorite shirts.  He's worn that for a lot of his big gigs.  I was really excited.  You know what is so exciting, besides that he's a friend, that he's doing such edgy material.  Yeah.  Finally, that somebody's getting on, you know, on network TV.  Yeah.  I mean, I did a prime time.  But, and he's doing stuff that really.  Nice try, boss.  That he's doing.  It's not about you today.  Well, yeah, it is.  I didn't take a train, all right, to talk about meaty breasts, all right?  I mean, to talk about it Wednesday.  His mic stinks, right?  Is that why you're coming in?  He's really low. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, it is low.  Why is that?  Is he pushed all the way up?  Boss, just jump over to that mic, see if that works better.  Damn it.  What?  I have him cranked, too.  Oh, I don't really feel comfortable.  That's better.  I don't feel comfortable over here.  But, you know, doing that edgy material he did.  And it was great when he said about, you know, too old about the girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Well, we got the whole thing.  We're going to do, we're going to give Jim Norton's stand-up, you know, a listen here from  The Tonight Show, and then his couch time as well. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but going back to what Anthony said, Anthony thinks six months he's off this show.  He's gone.  He's gone.  So I guess we've got to start treating you a little better.  Let me tell you, if that HBO show hits and then his special, let me tell you something.  He's going to do really well.  He's going to be able to pick up, like, fives instead of fours now.  But he'll move on.  He's doing this gig because it definitely pays his bills.  He's really got no other huge source of income, hawking his T-shirts and CDs. 
[03:13:00]  But, I don't know.  Well, I think offers will come in where he's not going to be able to turn them down.  It's going to be for more money than he's making doing this.  And that's when we lose him.  Bye-bye.  And then, you know what we do?  We just hose down that seat and welcome Rich Voss in the program.  Like when someone gets killed at Disney.  It happens every year or so.  Someone's on a ride.  They get killed at Disney.  What does Disney do?  Shut the ride down. 
[03:13:30]  Close the park down.  They put up the little barriers.  They hose it down, open it up like it never happened.  You're back in business.  Let me explain about Norton because Norton's like my best friend.  I've known him.  Norton's middle name should be Stepping Stone.  But, you know, he might have used, you know, he went from you like dice to you to Colin back to you guys.  But here's the thing.  He'll hit big.  But he'll self-destruct.  And something will happen.  And it'll probably be with a black male with a wig.  And what's going to happen is they're not going to tolerate his nonsense in Hollywood. 
[03:14:00]  And he's going to be back.  He will be back beaten down.  He'll have a little cash.  And, you know, but he's going to hit big.  And then he's going to fall.  I see, like.  And I want to be outside his house when he has that garage sale.  And he starts stealing all that stuff outside his million dollar condo.  Yeah, because it's closer than eBay in Florida.  What's that?  Because it's closer than eBay in Florida.  Oh, look at the sprained leg football players talking to me now.  I'm fine right now.  Oh, you are?  You want to go oompa loompa?  Oh, let's go.  Guys, 10 times.  Want to play me in golf for cash?  I'll play you in golf for cash.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:30]  I will.  My money's on him.  Wow, really?  Because he drives a ball fart?  I'll take three clubs and beat you.  Are you out of your mind?  I'll take a putter, seven iron, and a three wood.  Is he a scratch golfer?  You have no idea who you're talking about.  Is he a scratch?  Talking to him, I mean.  All right.  Three clubs and you'll beat him.  300-yard drives, no problem.  Big deal.  Drive for show, putt for dough.  Probably even further.  Oh, you'd make that up?  I like that.  You should get that on a t-shirt.  Actually, I've played golf with both you guys.  It would be a very good match. 
[03:15:00]  He drives the shit out of the ball and hits it straight.  Yeah.  But on the greens, he's like a gorilla.  He has no touch whatsoever.  Be fair.  When we played, it was January, and I haven't played in six months.  I saw him drive a par four.  Yeah.  And then four puns.  Look at those big gorilla arms.  He's going to touch the ball.  It's going to fly back into the rough.  I thought it was a donut hole.  Sorry.  This guy has no touch, but man, he can hit the shit out of a ball.  Very good.  So did you guys talk about Michael? 
[03:15:30]  No, we'll get into that after the break.  What we're going to do here, we're going to play Norton's set from Jay Leno last night.  Funny, man.  It's unbelievable.  The video's up on opianthony.com, foundrymusic.com.  And when you listen to this, just remember, this is on fucking NBC.  That's what we're saying in the office when we're watching this.  We're like, Jay Leno.  You know, I wasn't buying Norton's whole argument between Jay Leno and Letterman, but I'm just  starting to see it now.  Yeah.  I'm just starting to see it.  You get away with a lot more.  I understand that now. 
[03:16:00]  Unfortunately, listening to audio, too, you don't get the expression thing, because there  were a couple of times that he got the audience roaring just from a look.  He looked over and did.  When he looked at Hilary Duff, like, hi, you know, and she was just looking into the eyes  of a rapist.  And Jay, you know, turns to him and just says, 17, 17.  And he's like, bam, two seconds.  Oh, too young.  Too old.  I stink.  Too old.  This is a huge day.  I rot.  God, I fucked that whole thing up, didn't I? 
[03:16:30]  But you know why I think he gets away with a lot more?  Move on and help you out there.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But then Boss had to jump in, and now it's all fucked up.  No, I was acknowledging that.  I had to call myself a dick for that one.  But I was just going to hose it off.  Hose it down?  I was going to hose that joke off.  Move on.  What were you going to say, Boss?  Well, I think he gets away with a lot more on Leno, because Leno still does stand-up,  and he's a stand-up comic.  He's out there, so he lets you get away with more.  He appreciates it more.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  He's not like...  Yeah, he knows what comedy's about and what comics are. 
[03:17:00]  He's out in the clubs.  Leno goes to the clubs every week.  Letterman has no clue.  All right, let's go to Bill in North Carolina.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, first off, let me preface the whole thing with Jimmy is freaking awesome.  He killed last night.  It was wonderful.  But I'm just sick and tired of Opie and Anthony and everybody out there caressing Rich Boss'  ego every time he comes on the show.  Oh, he killed.  He's a freaking nobody, man.  He gets on there, and you guys start talking about, what a great job.  Jimmy did, and as soon as he does it, oh, I'm doing a pile of Obama this. 
[03:17:30]  You know, Rich, we don't give a fuck, dude.  You are a worthless piece of shit.  Yeah, how much money are you making this week?  How much money are you making this week?  Why sucking cock for it, Rich?  How much money are you making this week?  I made fucking cock for it, Rich.  Neither am I.  How much money are you making?  How much money are you making this week?  You're a fucking cheap-ass used car salesman motherfucker.  Oh, hey, hey.  You know what?  Obviously, I'm doing my job, because look at how angry you are.  I'm doing my job as a comic, because you're so angry.  Now, keep listening, faggot.  All right?  Yeah, Bill.  Can you go on eBay and buy a Rolls Royce?  Yes.  That's right. 
[03:18:00]  All right?  And let me tell you something.  I've done three network TV shows in the last two years, stupid.  All right.  Let's go to Will in Jersey.  Will, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, make it fast, Will.  Yeah, all right.  I just wanted to say, if you notice when Jim sits down, Jay Leno retracts that little  footstool he had up for Hillary Duff.  That was funny.  And Jimmy's feet don't quite hit the ground.  He's got to do a little...  Yeah, his feet were dangling off the big guest chair.  And Jay said something like, you don't need that, do you?  And he pulled away the thing that Hillary Duff had to use. 
[03:18:30]  And there's a little electronic thing.  And Jimmy was like on his tippy toes trying to touch the floor.  His little feet were dangling down in a huge chair.  That's all I got, guys.  All right.  Good enough.  Let's go to Brian in Boston.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning.  Do us all a favor.  If Jimmy leaves, can you just pick someone from random at Fenway?  Oh, we'll do that old gag.  Yeah.  Hey, we're going to be checking ticket numbers at Fenway Park and deciding who's going to  be a co-host on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:19:00]  Stupid hack radio bit.  Ugh.  All right.  Why don't we play Norton's set from last night on the Leno show?  All righty.  On the Leno show.  Jay Leno's tonight show.  Mm-hmm.  Huge, huge night for Jim Norton.  And a nice little mention for the Opie and Anthony program as well.  Absolutely.  That's not going to hurt us.  That's very good.  So without further ado, check out the audio.  The video's up on our website.  He's on the Opie and Anthony show on XM Satellite Radio every single morning, June 25th.  He'll be at the State Theater in Falls Church, Virginia. 
[03:19:30]  Please welcome Jim Norton.  Thank you.  Thank you.  How are you?  Good.  There's always this weird moment when you first look at the audience.  Like, I'm hoping you're going to be a great crowd and you guys are kind of looking and  hoping I don't suck.  And the most common question you get as a comedian, what happens if you tell a joke and  it bombs?  To be honest, I tend to just go to the next joke. 
[03:20:00]  There aren't exactly a lot of options.  Not like I can run through the room and tickle you individually.  And it's not uncomfortable for a comic.  It's a part of our job.  The reason that frightens audience members is because in your own lives, you don't have  the next joke option.  It's much harder to bomb in real life.  Like, you ever try to be funny around your girlfriend's family or your co-workers and  it gets a zero?  Like, the kind of bomb where they just avoid eye contact with you for a little while?  You got to just stand there and soak in your humiliation with your stupid eye-bombed face? 
[03:20:30]  You ever try to play it off like you didn't mean it to be funny?  You ever have a joke bomb so badly, it may have been a serious statement?  So you try to sneak out of it by going, oh, I'm just saying.  You know, maybe you're at work, the big meeting's about to start, your boss walks in, there's  no eye in team.  You're like, yeah, but there's two in syphilis. 
[03:21:00]  I'm just saying.  I'm actually enjoying my time back in Los Angeles.  I live in New York.  I got ripped off this week, man.  I went for a massage.  Did you know there are legitimate massage places?  I honestly got had no idea.  I thought she was kidding. 
[03:21:30]  She finishes with my feed.  She's like, all done.  I'm like, it was awful.  I'm on my stomach for 55 minutes.  She finally turns me over and she said, all right, I'm going to crack your toes, which  means she grabs each toe, squeezes it and yanks on it, which, you know, right idea, wrong  location.  I felt like such a creep.  Every time she grabbed her toe, I tried to scooch down two and a half feet.  I'm a lonely man.  I've been single almost three years, kind of playing the field. 
[03:22:00]  I call it, uh, I call it playing the field.  You might call it picking up prostitutes.  And I've fallen into this place with this girl I know, this horrible place.  But I have become the guy friend.  Is there anything more repulsive than being the guy friend?  And women, you always know when we like you.  And you deny it even to your girlfriends.  You're like, I think he's in love with you.  You're like, oh, no, we're just friends. 
[03:22:30]  He enjoys taking me to the airport.  And there is nothing worse, as a man, than when you're hitting on a woman and she has  that awful, blocking male friend.  Because you can just feel his energy.  You're trying to talk to her.  He's like, dude, don't hurt her.  She's like my sister.  Is she really, you fun-draining cancer?  Why does a guy always make a sister figure out of some braless model who looks like Jessica  Simpson?  You never hear a man claiming that about a fat chick with facial hair. 
[03:23:00]  Even if she is your sister, you keep it under your hat.  Ugh, who's that?  I don't know.  We met at a barbecue once.  I think we have the same parents.  So I don't know what to do about this girl I like.  I really am very uncomfortable around women.  I know you look at me and you think, God, it must be so easy for you.  If I get really nervous, I mean, this  is just a front. 
[03:23:30]  And for me, making the first move means you roll down the passenger window, you know,  beep, beep.  If she gets in, you hope it's not a guy.  You ever make that mistake?  You don't get your money back.  That's why my motto is toughen up and finish. 
[03:24:00]  Hey, look, I'm not gay.  This is a matter of economics.  I wish I was gay.  Gay men are lucky.  You can go out and rob banks if you get caught and go to jail.  Well, thanks a lot, everybody.  You guys were great.  Thank you.  There you have it.  A huge night for Jim Norton on Jay Leno's Tonight Show.  Unbelievable, huh?  Yeah.  That was huge.  Then he sat down.  Yeah, that's what I'm getting now. 
[03:24:30]  The couch.  The couch, the all-important couch.  A lot of comics do with Leno, you know.  But then the couch, the sitting, the chatting, that's huge.  It's kind of weird, too, because it looked fake.  I was saying it looked fake when I watched it.  It looked like you went to an amusement park, and they kind of make you look like you're on Leno or something.  Because it's Jimmy, and he's sitting there, and he's talking to Jay Leno, and it's on The Tonight Show,  and Hilary Duff is next to him, and it's like they just popped him in there using some kind of green screen technology or something. 
[03:25:00]  You know, we're pretty jaded at this point.  We've seen a lot of celebrities and stuff, but I've got to tell you, you're so right.  Yeah.  Seeing our old pal on Jay Leno last night.  Our little mess.  It just didn't seem real.  It was cool as shit to check out, but it just didn't seem right.  And you know what?  He killed the first time.  No, could you just move over there?  Jesus fucking Christ.  What, that was supposed to be fixed?  Yeah, and then they move him over. 
[03:25:30]  The fucking mic sucks, and we need all mics today.  God.  He killed the first time.  So the pressure for him to re-kill, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  The first time he was on Leno, he killed that night.  So, I mean, he killed even more this time.  And that's huge.  They'll invite him back now.  He'll become a regular.  Then he'll do the sitcom, and then he'll do movies, and forget it.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye, Jimmy.  Let's say hi to George in Texas.  George?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up? 
[03:26:00]  Oh, not much.  I'm just wondering if anybody else noticed Hillary Duff.  She looked like she was pretty coked out of her mind.  She was going like 100 miles an hour.  Coked out?  She was sticking to her teeth.  Like, she's 17 years old.  You guys are too much, man.  Yeah, she looked coked out, man.  That's all our dream.  Yeah, she was all energetic on the Leno show or something.  Right.  She should have just lounged on.  What, should she have fallen asleep on the couch or something?  Dude, she looked like she was on Vicodin or something. 
[03:26:30]  She was all slow and shit.  You would have known if she was coked out because she has the hugest teeth.  I mean, she can't hide the fact that they would be grinding.  Yeah.  She's too fat to be coked out.  Fat.  She's like 98 pounds.  That's a good joke, actually.  Chris in Dayton, Ohio.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to tell you guys to die.  We watched that at work last night, and you guys sold two XM units to the guys that never laugh at anything on Leno,  and they laughed at Norton horribly. 
[03:27:00]  They love that guy.  And he just killed Hillary Duff.  I mean, it was great.  All right, very good.  It was a good thing to see.  Yeah, the looks he was shooting over at her were just frightening.  All right, why don't we play the couch time then?  Mm-hmm.  So after Norton's stand-up, he got to sit down with Jay Leno.  No, a huge honor, I would assume.  A lot of these comedians, they just do their thing, and that's it.  Yeah.  But Norton got to do some couch time.  Sit down, do the couch time, and he killed there, too. 
[03:27:30]  So are you liking L.A. now?  I know you are a dyed-in-the-wool New York.  Are you enjoying your time here?  I actually, I used to hate L.A., but I have one stupid hobby, and L.A. is great for that.  I get pictures with celebrities, which I annoyed you for the first time I was here.  And I've been doing it for years, and it's very rare that I've ever turned down by a celebrity for a picture or an autograph.  And I finally realized why.  It's because I look like I could be a problem.  Yeah.  There is just something about my rapidly blinking eyes.  That's why I took the picture, yeah.  I just, I don't want any problem with this. 
[03:28:00]  It's not that people think I'm going to kick their ass, but I do look like I might bite your face.  Yeah.  And I came to realize this years ago.  I'm an Ozzy Osbourne fanatic, and my friend sneaks me into MTV.  He's like, all right, man, just kind of hang back.  So I walk by an open dressing room door, and there is Ozzy.  So I stare.  And Ozzy is talking, and he looks out at me.  And when he looks at me, I smiled and licked my lips.  And he kind of walked out of view, so I couldn't stare at him anymore.  And I realized I'd made him uncomfortable.  And then it dawned on me, do you know what a weirdo you have to look like to make Ozzy Osbourne a little fan? 
[03:28:30]  Exactly.  Well, any other celebrities that you've seen?  I don't even necessarily have to be a fan.  I remember I was opening for Dice in Vegas years ago, and Tiger Woods was in the crowd.  I don't like golf.  I think golf sucks, and golf clubs are great for assaulting people.  Yeah.  But I like Tiger Woods, so I walk up to him after the show, and I'm nervous.  And I'm like, you know, hello, Mr. Woods.  And he is such a sweet guy. 
[03:29:00]  He's like, you were awesome.  Which was odd to hear a black guy go, awesome.  Yeah, he's black.  And I wanted to have, like, a nice moment with him.  I just got really intimidated.  He's like, you were awesome.  I'm like, thanks, man.  You golf good.  You ever open your mouth and wish you had a shotgun with a toe attachment?  I have one second with this icon. 
[03:29:30]  I sound like an extra from M.A.S.H.  You golf good, and me have head wound, Hawkeye.  Well, how about dating?  Are you seeing anyone right now?  I'm like, dude, I give people the creeps.  It's hard for me to date.  Hard to date, yeah.  I have a tendency to be too toothy when I smile,  which really grosses a girl out if you're a boy.  You're like, where are you from?  And then I rub my hands together vigorously.  Yeah, that's...  While staring at her cleavage and mumbling,  Nice!  Yeah, that's...  I can see how that could be a problem. 
[03:30:00]  Uh, hi.  Hi!  Hey, did you, uh...  Can you just stumble into that problem every once in a while?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seventeen.  What's that?  Seventeen.  Ooh, you're old.  Now, did you watch the Tyson fight, Sam?  Uh, the Tyson fight, I actually did not watch.  I had probably my most embarrassing experience 
[03:30:30]  trying to get a Tyson autograph.  Years ago in New York, about five years ago,  Mike Tyson's outside the comedy cellar  with a big entourage,  and I go up to get an autograph,  and his bodyguard goes,  Whoa, whoa, whoa, man, where are you going?  And I said,  Oh, man, I just wanted to get an autograph.  He goes,  Sorry, man.  Mike's not meeting anyone tonight.  And I actually said,  But he's the champ.  I was 31 years old,  and I regressed to five-year-old boy talk  to get the signature of a rapist from Brooklyn. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, man.  But he's the champ.  Jim, very funny.  He's on the Open Anthony show every morning  on Satellite Radio,  and, of course,  at the State Theater in Falls,  South Virginia.  Thank you, buddy.  There you have it,  the man of the hour,  Jim Norton,  and on the phone,  it's Jim Norton.  Jimmy!  Hey, what's up, guys?  There he is,  the big star.  That was actually dumb timing.  I'm in a car right now  going to the airport in Los Angeles.  I just called in,  and I'm like, 
[03:31:30]  I better do it before I actually get to the airport.  That was good to hear that.  Yeah, it was perfect timing, actually.  Dude, you're getting rave reviews  from everybody from all over the country.  Oh, thanks, man.  Yeah, it was cool.  The panel went well.  I was very happy with it.  It was kind of, you know,  it was fun.  Wow.  You were very relaxed  because we just replayed that,  and Voss is in studio.  We're all laughing  because all of a sudden  you go to Jay Leno,  yo, dude,  or whatever.  Yeah, dude.  Call him dude.  Actually,  I thought of that after.  I'm like,  I'm going to get my face smashed  for calling Leno dude.  Dude.  Dude. 
[03:32:00]  You're talking about relaxed.  Yeah, you were relaxed enough  to call Jay Leno dude.  Hey, did you get  Hilary Dush's phone number?  No, she wanted nothing to do with me,  but she did take a picture with me.  Of course she did.  Well, we were watching,  you know,  your performance in the office  before the show today,  and you're talking about  celebrity photos,  and I said,  Anthony,  I'm surprised he's not asking  for a photo with Hilary  right there.  Dude,  my manager told me  I should bring my camera out  and get one on the set  and ask Jay to take it  because I heard she was  kind of weird  with Flitler's photos. 
[03:32:30]  She doesn't like  taking pictures of people.  Really?  Yeah, I knew it.  I made sure,  I had my manager  make sure that she was  actually going to be  on the couch.  If not,  I would have had to,  like, you know,  get her as soon as  she walked off the set.  But it was cool, man.  It was definitely nice,  and I did what I should have done  after a great,  you know,  time on television.  I went for a swim  with Yoshi  on the roof of the hotel,  and that was it.  It was awful.  You didn't pick up  a hook or nothing?  No,  that night before,  I actually did.  I spent a couple hundred,  you know,  just getting myself prepared,  and then my Asian friends  and I went for a dip  in the pool.  Like, two homos, 
[03:33:00]  we had to buy bathing suits.  I went to the Hustler store  and bought a bathing suit  for me and my gentleman friend.  We went for a swim.  We went for a swim.  That's not like you.  Where did you go do the set?  I've got exercise.  What's that?  Did you go do the set  like the night before?  Yeah, I did it at the improv.  And it went well,  the improv?  Yeah, it went really good.  That was really funny, man.  You were so relaxed.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, it was good.  I mean,  I liked my first set,  actually.  The first time I was out,  I preferred this first set  to this one.  No.  But I love this panel.  So it was actually very, 
[03:33:30]  it was very...  Your little feet dangling  off the seat  were really funny.  And some fans,  the fans don't miss anything.  One of the fans goes,  you idiot,  you reached for Leno's cup.  And I actually remember doing that.  I'm like,  oh yeah,  I did.  Oh,  giving Leno AIDS.  Sapping up his cup  with AIDS.  I really did reach  for his cup  like a shemoth.  And of course,  and of course,  announcing that Hillary Duff  is too young,  that was...  No,  too old,  sorry.  See,  it's easy to do. 
[03:34:00]  I know.  Announcing that Hillary Duff  was too old,  that just killed.  Dude,  that was really...  It was definitely...  I thought they were  going to take that out.  I was so happy they left  and I'm really glad  other networks,  I'm sure,  would have taken that out.  I'm amazed with what  they let through there  on that show.  Yeah,  when we were watching  The Office,  I kept looking over  at Anthony going,  this is on Leno.  Like,  you know,  the whole,  you know,  the massage jokes  and the tranny jokes  and all that stuff.  Massage joke  or tranny joke.  Someone on the left  pointed out  and there was  a syphilis reference 
[03:34:30]  and then a pedophile joke.  Yeah.  My only regret,  and I did think  of doing this beforehand  was that during the golf  that I should have  said golfer,  but Tiger Woods  is a great golfer.  I just couldn't get it out  and make it down that hole.  Yeah,  I was waiting for it too.  I tried,  I was just Nick Nervous.  I was just so happy  to be there.  Nick Nervous.  Well,  my prediction,  you will be gone  from this show  in six months.  Oh,  please.  It's gone much too well  and I just see  huge things for you  and it's basic  eggonomics 
[03:35:00]  that you will...  Did I say eggonomics?  Yes,  you said eggonomics.  People have been  ragging you about it  all morning.  I meant to say  eggonomics.  I just got it.  Yes.  Lego my ego.  I just mean  to do that  when I'm a fool.  I am.  And you'll have  all kinds of offers  and we will be  just a mere  stepping stone  for Jimmy  and we'll be stuck  with Rich Voss  and his  thousand dollar  Rolls Royces.  Oh,  Voss,  did you get  any of your money  back or no? 
[03:35:30]  Yeah,  I got my money back.  Oh,  you did?  You're not going  to mess around  with me  when it comes to money  and I was ready  to call the attorney general.  Bonnie's shaking her head  and rolling her eyes  behind you  like,  oh,  yeah,  he got his money back.  We got to get Bonnie's  side of this story.  Yeah,  because you have to be  embarrassed by the fact  that you went to buy  a Rolls off eBay.  And who was going  to drive this thing?  I was going to have  it shipped up,  500 bucks.  No,  I mean,  but then you have  the car in Jersey.  Who's going to drive it?  I was going to take it  out on Sundays,  have Patrice drive me  and Bonnie drive me.  There's the answer.  Because you don't drive  your own Rolls Royce ever. 
[03:36:00]  That's not the thing.  No one drives  their own Rolls Royce.  You don't have a Rolls  to drive it around.  Someone drives you around.  That's what I just said.  I was going to get  Patrice driving around.  You thinking we had  a little chauffeur hat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well,  what a little  on that big melon head.  Hey,  Jim,  how was Jay Leno  in the dressing room  and all that?  Hey,  maybe you could drive it  and Patrice  could ride on the roof.  He was great.  He came in  for like 15 minutes  and he hung out.  He's just really cool, 
[03:36:30]  man.  He comes in,  he sits with me,  you know,  he was just talking  about satellite radio.  He was actually interested  in satellite radio  and asked a lot of questions.  So he was great.  Did my name come up at all?  Well,  yeah,  a couple of times  he mentioned it,  but I didn't want  to really talk about you  because I was a little nervous  and I was afraid  that he would kind of  boot me off the show.  You hear me trying to improv  when I'm really tired?  I think it's coming out.  I'm just kind of talking,  hoping something funny  shows up.  Are you in Virginia  this weekend?  No,  Dallas.  No,  a week from this.  I just wanted to plug it  because I can't do much  commercial radio in D.C.  Right.  Yeah. 
[03:37:00]  Well,  you're at the Dallas Improv  this weekend.  Yeah,  this weekend  I'm doing Dallas.  Addison,  actually.  Yes.  I was trying to get on Elliot,  the one that Rich did,  but they don't want me on.  I guess they got pissed off  that we were making fun  of his laugh or something.  Oh,  we're ruining,  now we're standing  in the way of your career.  Elliot,  I thought,  had a sense of humor.  I mean,  the guy's a fan of the program.  He's got to relax.  What a cock.  He's not going to let me back on  after that episode  when you guys told him.  Of course not.  Dude,  Elliot,  have a sense of humor,  man.  The guy,  he's been a fan of ours 
[03:37:30]  for years.  He can't take a little jab  that his laugh  was a little obnoxious  that day.  I don't know  if he does that every day.  They won't let you on  Don and Mike there,  Jimmy?  I tried,  I sent a tape,  I tried to,  there's something about,  you know,  free to being a cock  that they really just  didn't care for.  That's a true story,  man.  When you call  one of the host's wives  the C word,  ah,  it gets a little,  yeah,  I don't think  they'll have you on.  They got back to Jimmy  that that's the reason  he can't be on JFK.  Yeah,  he can't be on JFK  at all because  he called Don's wife 
[03:38:00]  a C.  All right.  Can't look past  those things.  Did I really say  egonomics?  What a fool.  Egonomics.  Hey,  Jimmy,  what were you thinking  just before Jay  introduced you?  Am I going to get  hung up on?  No.  Oh,  I thought you guys  were going to click on me  because I was really  rearing up the talk.  I was nervous,  man,  but I was like,  you know,  you did one of these  so this one is going to be  hopefully a little bit easier.  And you know what,  good,  I just didn't want it to  belong because I knew  I had to do like a lot  of paddle. 
[03:38:30]  Is it just completely  like all-encompassing  nerve-wracking  when you're waiting  to go on?  Like that you think  you're going to  friggin' die right there?  It's not that terrifying  just because I knew  I had done it once  before.  You're a little nervous,  you want to make sure  you do well,  but I was nervous  I had to do an  extended period of time  and I was like,  I hope the paddle  goes well.  I knew I was sitting there,  there's really nothing  you can do.  You know,  if you're eating your balls  and you're just sitting there,  there's nothing to do.  You just whipped out  good story after good story,  it was amazing. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah,  I kind of knew I had  to do panels,  so I had to have  that stuff ready.  Obviously the stuff  with Hilary Duff,  I didn't really plan  on doing it  until I was sitting there.  No,  but you nailed it,  dude,  you nailed it.  Yeah,  she was cool.  I mean,  I didn't know she was 17,  I actually thought  she was 18.  When he said that,  I was actually surprised.  I asked how old she was  before the show  and someone said  she's 18.  I was like,  okay.  Ah,  I appreciate it  and I'll be in tomorrow.  I was at a red light  last night,  but I had to stop for sushi.  You've got to be pretty bummed.  You were on a little  last night,  like,  I kind of heard  in your voice, 
[03:39:30]  yeah,  I'll be back tomorrow.  Yeah,  great.  Back to the old grind  tomorrow.  Yeah,  I'll be back in there,  guys,  tomorrow.  Back in with the guys  that didn't do Leno.  Yeah,  sitting with them.  He got in three plugs,  though,  which was cool.  He even said that to me.  He got in a couple extra plugs.  Yeah,  that was cool.  Yeah,  that made him proud  and happy.  That's why,  look,  I'm a part of the opening  Anthony show.  Opening mini.  Even Jay Leno  can't get it right.  He got it right a few times.  Yeah,  well,  I think he was just 
[03:40:00]  kind of throwing  in the extra one there  and he wasn't planning  on doing three,  which I was really happy  that he did that.  Jimmy,  a couple people  are asking,  so I'm just going to,  I know the answer to this  and you can say  whatever you want.  Mike from Brooklyn.  Did Jim talk  to Stuttering John?  Oh,  yeah,  dude.  He was totally cool.  John was a friend of mine.  He was very cool.  He said,  hello,  how are you,  man?  How's life?  He doesn't care about  the whole thing  that's going on.  Right,  okay.  He happened to be doing a gig.  He's got a great gig.  He loves it out there.  He's moved on.  Oh,  dude,  completely.  He didn't badmouth Howard 
[03:40:30]  or have anything.  None of that stuff.  He was just,  you know,  how's your gig,  how's radio,  how's the show is going.  He was just happy,  dude.  Did you hear what he just said?  Yeah.  And goes,  yeah,  Stuttering John has moved on  and Norm goes,  yeah,  completely.  Yeah.  And I'm just fast forwarding  my mind.  Yeah,  exactly.  When Jimmy moves on  completely.  When Jimmy moves on  completely.  You made it sound like,  yeah,  Stuttering John doesn't need  that crap anymore  and I won't either  in a few more months. 
[03:41:00]  I was saying that it,  was that?  Go ahead.  No,  no,  I was saying that it was  almost like,  I'm saying like any type  of bitterness  or any type of like  uncomfortability  about the two shows.  Like,  you know,  he's so.  No,  I know.  Honestly,  I didn't know what you meant,  but I had a,  I had a,  I'm not leaving the show.  That's it.  Yeah.  Oh,  he's dumb.  Look at stupid Bob Kelly  with Ty Roottenford to go up.  Hey,  Joe,  you never know.  I mean,  you know,  he probably walks around  smoking,  talking about stuff.  You know,  who knows?  The guy's like,  I just break my knee.  He'd be sitting in your seat. 
[03:41:30]  The reality is  if Bob Kelly  didn't break his knee,  he would have nothing  for this program.  Oh,  geez.  He had to break his knee  to get air time.  Hey,  tell Sato,  I'm going to be gone  for a month  to rip another ligament  quickly.  Yeah,  exactly.  Hey,  I'll be in tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to it.  I actually,  I hated being gone today.  I really wanted to come into it.  Jimmy,  a lot of people  are also wondering,  since you were nervous,  did you fart on the couch?  No,  I would not have had the ball.  That would have been  fucking hysterical 
[03:42:00]  if you would have  blasted out  one of those bad stinkers  right next to Hillary Duff  just to go,  just for you to be able  to point out to us  and I do it right here  and then to look at her face  and watch it change.  Jimmy,  that's what you got to do  for your third appearance  on J.  Oh,  yeah.  You got to drink  a lot of milk products  before you go on.  And just blast one out  a silent one  pointed out to us  so we can all look  at the person's face  next to you.  Look at us.  We don't care about  his set or anything. 
[03:42:30]  No.  Just fart on Jay Leno  next time,  please.  Sabotage it.  Right.  I dumped out before the show  because you just do,  you get like your body  emptied.  Before a big gig,  I don't know how boss  or how Bonnie is  like when I'm performing,  but even when I'm doing  a performing at a big gig,  I dump.  I completely empty out.  My body fucking just  completely clears out.  I piss like five times  right before I'm going on TV.  I always do.  I take a dump  and I was in the dressing room  and Jay comes by the dressing room  to talk to you  and I hear him knocking  on the outside dressing room  but I have it locked  so I'm taking a shit.  So I'm like,  oh great,  the host of the Tonight Show 
[03:43:00]  is trying to talk to me  and I'm fucking,  I'm taking a nice milk dump  to fuck it.  How weird is that?  You're just dumping away  and Jay Leno's banging  on the door  and he wants to talk to you.  Ah, Jimmy,  what are you doing in there?  Right.  Well, Jay.  That's very cool.  Frank in Jersey,  why no O&A shirt?  Of course you can't wear it.  You've got to dress up  for the Tonight Show.  It's funny,  they even mentioned that  to me the first time  I did it.  They said,  last time we were standing  I wore the Oprah and Anthony shirt  and I think Bob or Ross said,  you know,  you can't wear any radio shirts 
[03:43:30]  on the Tonight Show.  I'm like,  yeah,  it's not a problem, man.  And people were making fun  of your shirt.  I'm like,  that's one of Jimmy's favorite shirts  he was wearing last night.  He's worn that  to a lot of his big gigs.  Yeah,  that's a good...  And to the fan,  by the way,  to the fan that emailed,  I appreciate it.  You said that I did a good job.  But he said,  yeah,  you put on a little weight  into HBO.  I want to decapitate you.  I've lost weight  since HBO.  Do you know how,  that was the worst part  of my fucking trip out here.  Some idiot thinks  I got fatter  when I actually lost weight.  Well,  it might have been  the clothing  and the TV  kind of does that. 
[03:44:00]  It's a TV thing.  You know,  I'm not saying  you should have wore  a periwinkle shirt  or anything,  but it did look like  you were some lost person  from the NBC tour  that kind of just  wandered onto stage.  With that shirt up,  you look like  Pat Oswald's stunt double.  Pat Oswald.  I really am  a king of the hill  bodied pig.  You kill, man.  Did you get my message  before you did the show,  stupid?  I think so.  What'd you say?  I think I did get it,  actually.  Yeah, well,  you know,  where your only friend 
[03:44:30]  calls you  and wishes you luck  and says,  have a great set.  Well,  we all were like  expecting parents  because my phone  rang around.  What time did you call me?  Jim,  7,  7.30 maybe?  Yeah,  last time,  yeah.  And I saw  it was Jim Norton.  I just picked up the phone.  How'd it go?  I didn't even say hi  or anything.  He goes,  no,  I haven't done it yet.  I just wanted to tell you  what Jay was talking about  in the dressing room  with me or whatever.  Yeah,  it was cool.  It comes in,  it just really makes you  feel good.  It was like a very  relaxed conversation  about satellite  and about subscriptions  and the FCC  and stuff like that. 
[03:45:00]  You know,  he was great, man.  How about Bob and Ross?  Did they have a bunch  of gossip  and stuff to talk about?  Not really,  no.  I mean,  they were just concerned  because they knew  I had to do a while  so they were mostly  concerned with,  you know,  the leading questions  and the panel  and stuff like that.  But no,  they really didn't.  Although,  fucking,  Ross is getting really big.  He's uncomfortably  like fucking large.  All right,  Jimmy,  before we let you go  because I know  you've got a flight.  Yeah.  And I won't say  we'll let you be today.  Are they telling you  that I,  they're telling us  we've got to let you go? 
[03:45:30]  Yeah,  yeah.  Oh,  I just came in.  Who said that?  You're an ass  for pointing that out  by the way,  my friend.  I'm actually,  I'm actually at the airport  so I'll be on a plane  and.  All right,  well we'll see you  on the show tomorrow,  buddy.  All right,  and see you later,  Rich.  Great set, man.  I'll see you guys soon.  Congratulations.  Yes,  Jimmy.  Thanks,  boys,  and I'll see you tomorrow.  All right,  there he goes,  Jim Norton.  Hey,  you know what's,  yeah,  six months.  Done.  Done.  Off the show.  And he's convinced.  Convinced.  It's gonna,  the thing is, 
[03:46:00]  too many things  are gonna be offered  to him for too much money.  Well,  he's got the HBO,  um.  Right now,  the only reason  he's doing the show  is money.  He enjoys doing it,  don't get me wrong,  but it's paying  for his apartment,  you know,  his apartment,  his place that he bought.  He just bought a place.  It's paying for it.  Now there's gonna be  other things that come up  that all of a sudden,  oh,  now it's not the radio show  that's gotta be the gravy here  where the money comes from.  It's this,  so he's gonna be,  but Jimmy is,  Jimmy is one of the, 
[03:46:30]  he's a loyal friend,  though.  I understand loyalty.  But there reaches a point,  if it gets to,  it's gonna get to a point  where it's gonna be tough  for him,  I think,  to do this radio show,  but he'll always be,  you know,  connected to this show.  Yeah.  He won't be one of these guys  like,  ah,  I don't need that anymore,  I'm outta here.  He's always been,  you know,  fiercely loyal to his,  uh,  his friends.  If MIT called me  and wanted me to be  a professor up there,  offered me more money  than here,  I'd be gone.  You know.  Welcome  to the opening  and tense. 
[03:47:00]  Ah,  you son of a bitch!  XM 202,  the OVN Anthony Show.  Hey guys,  you like the Dom Marrera?  You bet I do.  Dom Marrera.  I'm not asking you guys,  I'm asking the listeners.  Oh.  The guy in his car right now,  the chick,  you know,  playing with her,  her,  her,  her baby maker?  Where are you going?  I don't know.  We're all,  we're all over the road.  Well listen,  this is about Dom's second call 
[03:47:30]  because,  uh,  we talked about topics  that were,  uh,  Comedy Central's,  uh,  top 100 comics,  list funniest people,  in,  um,  L.A.  list,  and how the,  uh,  haunted comedy store is haunted.  Oh,  unscrabble,  oh,  unscrabble.  Wow.  We're good.  No one can speak.  We are so fucking tired.  Yeah,  I'm very tired.  Just hit the tape.  Humana,  humana,  humana.  Like,  we really need to intro this.  It's Dom Marrera being funny. 
[03:48:00]  Jesus.  Say,  Jim,  nice meal.  The worst of OVN Anthony.  This is some sexual reference.  One of our pals is on the line here.  Dom.  Good morning.  Good morning,  Dom.  Oh,  Dom.  Hi,  Dom.  What a fun thing to follow.  Oh,  well,  we just went serious for like an hour.  We don't,  we don't do serious radio,  but when we do,  man,  we really get into it,  and,  uh,  and now we're trying to move on back into the funny zone.  Well,  you know,  you are the guys that I go to for hard hitting news.  All the time.  How you doing?  How are you,  man? 
[03:48:30]  We can hang with the best of them when we have to,  Dom.  I know that.  You know,  uh,  the media likes to just call us shock jocks,  but there's so much more to this program.  You're Bates and Cronkites.  That's what you are.  Yes.  I was watching this amateur lesbian video.  I was thinking,  what do these girls have to do to turn pro?  They're so good.  They got somewhere.  I don't get it.  I mean,  they can't get a break.  That is a great observation.  Amateur.  Yeah.  You got to hang out in the,  in the minors for a while, 
[03:49:00]  hoping someone notices you.  Some kind of scout,  right?  I know.  There was one other video called tongue to ass.  And I'm looking at this and,  you know,  real porn chicks look at these girls going,  that ain't me.  Big hairy ass in her face.  Not into that.  I hope I changed the mood a little.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just a tad.  Definitely.  Hotter.  I'm coming in to do bananas.  In Hasbrook Heights,  New Jersey.  Yeah.  It's funny.  It's like,  I love the club, 
[03:49:30]  but you know,  the name kind of withdraws your dignity.  Yeah.  How you doing?  Yeah.  I saw you on that.  What are you doing this week?  I'm at bananas.  Oh,  see you later,  man.  Keep up the good work.  And it's an,  I love the club.  I love the club.  I do that one,  but it's like the worst backdrop is you're in front of a black stage with fucking bananas  hanging behind you.  With the,  with the plastic banana and that chimp.  Yeah.  There's a chimp.  Are you kidding?  And the,  and the theme song is the worst theme song in comedy.  It's like,  we have no bananas.  Oh my God. 
[03:50:00]  Oh no.  It's an awful theme song.  I love the people who own it.  Harleen.  Harleen.  Harleen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Harleen.  Harleen and Arleen Jameson.  They were born old Jews.  Eventually they won't even have words.  It'll just be,  eh,  eh,  oi,  shmeagle.  Why are you only doing Saturday the 18th?  I'm doing a corporate thing on Friday.  Oh,  look at you with the corporate gigs.  I'm too busy to do Fridays.  What,  what company?  I don't know.  Oh.  I just get taken in a car like some joke monkey. 
[03:50:30]  And I fucking do it for an hour and that's it.  You gotta be clean?  I hope not.  Do you like the corporate gigs?  No.  No.  I don't like them because,  you know,  then you're,  they didn't come to see you.  You're at their mercy.  Which I hate,  you know,  and then they give you that shit.  Hey,  mention the boss's wife.  Right.  You know,  and then you don't know whether you're going to have somebody crying or,  or laughing.  You know,  you gotta,  they say,  you know,  work clean,  but you can be a little blue.  What the fuck does that mean?  You know?  Their idea of blue and a comedian's idea of blue are completely different.  Right. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah,  I'm talking about jizz shooting over a head.  And they mean,  you know,  you say poop or something.  And it is always an awful thing they try to tell you.  Like,  all right,  Marjorie just found out she has ovary cancer.  Tease her a little about it.  Tease her a little bit about it.  What about the uplifting side of that?  The fact that I said I'm 36 and I didn't say ovarian cancer,  I said ovary cancer.  Ovary cancer.  I know what though.  Like a dummy.  The line's so strong, 
[03:51:30]  who cares?  That's right.  I didn't even pick it up.  That's up right.  Yeah.  When the line's strong,  it just doesn't matter if it's not grammatically correct.  It works.  It works.  Are you doing the Montreal Comedy Festival again,  Dom?  No.  Are you guys going up?  I went a couple of years in a row.  I loved it up there.  Yeah.  No,  I'm going to go up there,  but I'm not going to do the festival.  I'm doing the improv in West Palm that week.  But I go,  you know,  my girlfriend's from there.  Yeah.  So it's a good chance to see her,  you know,  wait for my wife and just relax.  Is this thing going on alone?  I love that. 
[03:52:00]  But it's fine.  And how's Brother Wee's doing,  you know?  I check in with him like once a week,  and so far so good with the cancer thing.  Speaking of bringing the funny back to the show.  I know.  We're not on the air now,  are we?  Well,  Dom's a good friend of Brother Wee's as well,  and he went through a brutal form of cancer,  man,  I'll tell you.  But he's so far so good.  We'll see what happens.  He's coming back to New York in July for a checkup.  Is he back on the air at all?  Yes.  Yeah,  he's back on the air.  I mean,  he wasn't eating.  It was just awful.  I mean,  he was getting his radiation here in New York. 
[03:52:30]  I've seen him pretty much every day,  or just about,  anyway.  But he's a trooper,  I'll tell you.  He's a great guy.  He's great at radio,  too.  Yeah,  I complain a lot less after seeing what he went through,  I've got to tell you.  Oh,  I know.  But,  yeah,  he's doing all right.  Yeah,  it's hard to talk about your anxiety attack.  Right.  The guy's going through that shit.  Oh,  my God.  Radiation blasted right through,  right on his head.  Right on his head,  basically.  Ground zero was like his nose.  I know.  Pretty much his nose and that whole area, 
[03:53:00]  you know,  hitting the back of the nasal,  way deep in the nasal is where the tumor was,  I guess.  It couldn't operate.  Anthony's getting all squeamish.  Hey,  boy,  I'm getting hungry here.  I'm getting all heebie-jeebies.  Anybody for some oatmeal?  Yeah.  Hey,  by the way,  congratulations.  L.A. Magazine named you one of the top funniest people in Los Angeles.  I was in L.A. a couple of days ago reading the magazine.  And you were certain...  Go ahead.  Well,  you're certainly deserving. 
[03:53:30]  Ellen was number one.  But the fact that they had to put an equal number of women and men...  Well,  you know what?  Oh,  they did?  I asked them about that.  It was all women editors.  Of course.  Of course.  And I said,  and then they told me there was no particular order to the top ten.  Because people,  you know how sometimes people never are fucking satisfied in life.  I go,  you know,  I was number nine,  right?  So I don't give a shit.  I'm number nine.  I was 79,  100 greatest comedian.  Cedric the Entertainer was ahead of me.  How much,  how seriously can I take it?  I'm glad someone's saying that. 
[03:54:00]  He's an entertainer.  He sings,  he dances,  he has people over.  He entertains.  He has people over.  He does close-up card tricks.  I don't get the Cedric,  man.  I like Barber Shop,  or whatever the hell that movie was.  Yeah,  yeah.  But besides that,  I don't get the entertainer.  I'm sorry.  You know what?  It's so much easier for black guys sometimes,  because they can just do the rhythm without even jokes and get away.  I was at the bus stop. 
[03:54:30]  They both didn't come.  Why'd I go to the bus stop when the bus ain't even stopping?  Shit,  what's up with that?  You know what I mean?  I mean,  it definitely is easier,  because you drop that rhythm.  Wanda Sykes is terrific,  but you drop that rhythm from her,  and some of the jokes are not as strong,  you know?  Yeah.  I don't know,  Larry.  You know.  What do you think,  motherfucker?  I don't know.  I was talking about that on stage,  about Theft Comedy Jam.  Yeah.  And the guys are so gross and violent, 
[03:55:00]  and they say,  God bless you at the end.  Baby,  that pussy was so stinky,  it was stanky.  Stanky pussy.  Stanky,  stanky,  cluster,  musty,  pussy.  Hey,  God bless y'all.  That was after my grandmother.  Shout out to grandma.  But what I was going to say about that other thing was,  as soon as the article comes out,  I'm pleased there's an article,  you know?  What the fuck?  And a friend of mine calls me up,  and he goes,  you're funnier than Kathy Griffin.  She beat you too?  Oh,  boy.  But that's the fun,  but like,  you know,  I mean, 
[03:55:30]  that's the thing they looked at.  Look at us,  we're not,  you know,  talking about how you were,  you know,  in the top ten.  Right.  We have to rag on who beat you.  Something negative.  But it's not in any order.  Yeah.  I would do the Tonight Show,  and they go,  oh,  that was a great job,  but how come Carson didn't ask you for the panel?  I'm thinking,  what the fuck do I got to do to please you?  Right.  You know?  And it figures that a bunch of broad editors,  just a bunch of dumb women who can't,  like,  who are never funny,  can't make a decision on who's first.  Hey,  guys,  everyone's a winner. 
[03:56:00]  They're just such fucking wishy-washy idiots.  I've never heard Kathy Griffin ever be funny.  I like Kathy Griffin.  I actually think she's a very funny story player.  Have you seen her stand-up?  Yeah,  I thought she was very funny.  I don't know,  man.  Yeah,  but I mean,  the point was...  I like Ellen,  I'll admit it,  because on this show,  we don't like female comics in general.  You know,  every once in a while,  we get one that makes us laugh,  but...  Well,  yeah,  the funniest ones are usually the lesbians.  Yeah.  One of the things that cracked me up about the top 100 was,  listen,  number 99 was Janine Garofalo, 
[03:56:30]  and number 100 was Gallagher.  So how can you take it seriously?  Like,  talk about a contrast.  One of them's crushing watermelons,  the other one never got a fucking laugh in her life.  Wait,  you see,  even the women editors know that Janine Garofalo isn't funny,  but they threw her a bone like,  all right,  we'll give her 99.  Wait,  didn't she beat Dice?  Right above the guy that smashes watermelon.  Yeah,  Andrew was like 94.  Yeah,  she did beat Dice or something.  Oh,  it's just sickening.  Oh,  no, 
[03:57:00]  no,  he beat her.  He just beat her.  I think he might have been number 98 or something.  Wait,  and this is LA Comics?  No,  that was the top 100.  No,  top 100 Comedy Central.  Comedy Central.  Oh,  that's right.  We take comedy and remove the edge.  Yeah,  right.  The thing about it is they had like 10 Comedy Central people on there that were never really  that good,  you know?  It's like,  I mean,  it's why people can't take it seriously.  I did the thing,  and I was one of the hosts with Judy Gold,  Greg Giraldi,  and Mario Joyner,  right?  So none of them are on the 100. 
[03:57:30]  So they're pissed.  They're so pissed off.  Like once the cameras go up,  and they root against their type.  Like Mario didn't think any of the black guys were funny.  Judy hated all the women.  And Greg hated all the guys that were like bright,  observational guys.  Can I ask you,  how did,  how did,  how did Kenison get beaten out?  And I love Roseanne,  but how did she get into the top 10 and Kenison's number 20?  I mean,  first of all,  Roseanne and Kenison weren't even close,  you know,  because I mean,  I'm old enough to have worked a lot with them, 
[03:58:00]  and you got to be kidding me.  And Roseanne,  she would say to me,  hon,  you follow,  you go on after me.  I don't want to follow you.  I go,  hey,  you got a TV show.  Fuck you.  You follow me.  It's like,  but Sam was great.  Sam was,  I mean,  Sam was,  Sam's clean stuff was some of his funniest stuff,  you know,  but he,  I still used to bless myself.  I wasn't ready for some of the sacrilegious shit.  You know what I mean?  You had to bless yourself before going up on that?  No,  no,  just when he'd be saying certain things.  Oh,  really?  Yeah,  it was amazing how it affected me psychologically, 
[03:58:30]  because I never wanted to be like a wuss about anything,  but like some of that thing,  because I like to hedge my bets,  you know,  with God and everything.  I'm thinking,  I want to believe just in case,  like an insurance policy,  you know?  Yeah.  Right.  I don't want to mess with him too much.  Yeah,  Sam was pretty hardcore,  man,  with some of those jokes.  Well,  he was a preacher.  Yeah.  He really was riveting on stage,  because he had a rhythm that I just loved.  Yeah,  and I see these guys ripping him off now,  like with the screaming and all,  but it ain't the same,  you know, 
[03:59:00]  because he did it.  That's what's so hard about like doing stand-up now.  It's like,  you know,  the observations,  it better be about yourself,  because if you start going into certain things,  you know,  if you're going to do an airplane joke,  it better be brilliant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Enough with the airplane jokes.  Hey,  Dom,  being an L.A. comic,  you've obviously done the comedy store many,  many times.  You think that place is haunted?  Yeah.  I'm obsessed with that story.  Without a doubt.  Really?  100% haunted.  And you don't believe in ghosts,  do you?  No, 
[03:59:30]  I'm scared crapless of them.  But do you believe in them?  I tend not to believe in them,  but I'm one of those guys that I don't believe in them,  but please,  if they do exist,  don't come around,  because you're going to kill me.  Oh,  I could feel it,  man.  The comedy store is just such a creepy place  when you go,  you know,  backstage,  or whatever you want to call it,  in the kitchen area,  and then that room that has the chandelier.  During my hiatus,  I spent a lot of time out in L.A.  I was hanging out with Dice a few times,  just shooting the shit in that room with the chandelier,  and I'm not going to lie,  you know,  I didn't see anything,  but you just get creeped out when you're in that place. 
[04:00:00]  Yeah,  well,  no,  it's definitely haunted,  and I remember when I first went there,  I hate being in there alone,  like late at night.  Just explain for the rest of the country,  Dom,  this place used to be like a...  It used to be Heroes.  It was Heroes.  It was a nightclub,  when there were murders committed there.  Oh,  there were murders there.  Yeah,  and it was like a lot of gangsters hung out there,  and who's who of Hollywood at the time.  This is going back to,  what,  the 30s and the 40s or something?  Well,  not only were there murders there,  but there was also a guy who,  when they were on strike,  the comics were on strike in the late 70s, 
[04:00:30]  and this is a smart guy,  he jumped off the Hyatt,  trying to hit the comedy store with his body.  Which,  everyone knows,  it's impossible.  Come on,  guy.  Yeah,  it's not an easy jump.  We've been,  we've stayed at the Hyatt.  From the roof,  it looks like you can make it,  but,  you know,  you fall a lot faster.  And I have been on that roof,  trying to figure it out,  you know,  the physics of it,  because it's right next to the comedy store,  and there's a parking lot in between,  basically,  and I'm like,  you can't do that.  Get a nice full roof running start.  You know,  it's the saddest thing,  I don't even remember his name. 
[04:01:00]  This guy's got to be thinking,  if he's in heaven or hell,  what the fuck do I got to do  for people to remember my name?  No kidding.  More than jump off the Hyatt.  After the strike,  apparently he couldn't get work,  or Mitchie wouldn't work or something,  right?  Yeah,  that was it.  Did you know this guy at all,  personally?  No,  it was before I went out there.  I didn't go out to L.A.  until like 85.  Yeah,  this guy just,  yeah,  I mean,  it's creepy to think.  How many stories is that Hyatt?  20.  At least 20,  right?  Yeah,  at least.  Hey,  Tom,  go back to the comedy store being haunted 
[04:01:30]  before we move on.  It's 100% haunted.  There's no doubt in my mind,  I felt things,  I felt like a coldness in there,  like almost like a cold breeze,  with no windows open or anything,  and I just keep walking,  and I kind of like,  just say,  ooh,  you know,  like I'm telling you,  you can almost feel something  pulling at you.  I heard stories,  I mean,  I think I heard a story  when Sam was on,  and I guess he was saying  something kind of like evil  or demonic,  and somebody was like 
[04:02:00]  down the basement or something  and they heard like this,  you know,  whatever going,  he's here,  he's here,  he's here,  you know?  Like,  that's kind of creepy.  Yeah,  Kinnison and Dice,  when they used to get along,  they used to like perform seances  and try to go down the basement  and do all sorts,  yeah,  Dice told me some pretty interesting stories.  Yeah,  the basement's not a funny place.  Yeah,  I don't remember when,  and one time,  like him and Kinnison,  I guess,  ran out of the joint,  they were scared shitless.  Could have been,  well,  Dice doesn't do drugs,  but it could have been  the drugs Kinnison was on.  Yeah, 
[04:02:30]  no,  I heard,  I mean,  I heard like this Vietnam vet,  this guy Blake Clark,  and he wasn't afraid of anything,  and he got spooked out.  He was like,  he was closing it,  like,  you always hear the story  when it's the guy like  putting the chains on  at the end of the night.  Yeah.  You know,  but I don't even,  that must have been long ago  when Dice and Sam were there.  Oh,  a long time ago,  yeah,  because then they became enemies,  obviously,  but that place in general  is just really dark,  creepy.  No,  the light bulbs are barely  light enough  where you can see the hand  in front of your face,  and then you go to the bathroom,  it's all black tile,  very shiny, 
[04:03:00]  and the lights are very dim in there.  Well,  I went to the bathroom once,  and yeah,  Delbert Grady came up to me  because I had gotten some  avocado on my jacket,  and me and him  were talking for a while,  and he had some really scary stories  about his wife  and two daughters.  He had some good advice for you,  didn't he?  Yeah,  yeah.  But I remember walking up  to the urinal going,  don't even look at the top,  I remember,  you go through this  because you've heard the stories,  and like,  just look straight ahead  at the urinal,  don't look at these  shiny black tiles.  Because you'll see things in there.  You will.  Well,  it's definitely,  it's definitely got a bad vibe 
[04:03:30]  in that sense.  I mean,  I do stand up  like in the original room a lot,  and I know Joe Rogan  likes that room,  but in the main room,  I think,  is where Ciro's was more,  and that's where I feel it more,  like in the back of the main room.  Wait,  which one is the main room?  The big room,  like the 400 seater,  four or 500 seater.  I've been in there once,  I've never performed in there.  You feel it in the back of there,  like behind the stage,  or behind where the audience is?  Yeah,  behind the stage.  Behind the stage  is where I really feel it.  I don't know,  and supposedly one of the murders  was taking place  like in a big safe upstairs 
[04:04:00]  at the time.  This is the rumors I heard.  It's so weird  because you see like  these old pictures  like Jerry Lewis  and Dean Martin.  It was like this real  like nightclub  in the 50s,  I guess.  Yeah.  And I don't know  how it became the store,  but that was a good move  by Sammy Shore  in the divorce.  Sammy was the owner,  and he gave this comedy club  to his wife,  Mitzi,  and she ends up  making like millions  of dollars out of it.  He was just throwing it away,  you know?  Yeah.  These are Paulie's parents.  I don't know  if you've heard of Paulie Shore, 
[04:04:30]  but I'm not a laugher.  You've got to see this kid perform.  He's so original.  He's going to be somebody  someday.  He is.  He's going to.  Paulie said to me one time,  he goes,  he had a three-picture deal,  and he says,  and the waitresses,  you know,  were like hugging me  and stuff,  and he goes,  how come the waitress  make a fuss over you  and I got like  a three-picture deal  and they didn't even  talk to me?  And I says,  yeah,  I don't know,  Paulie.  I'm thinking,  maybe because I'm  fucking nice to them, 
[04:05:00]  you know,  maybe because I say hello  like a normal human being,  you know,  like these guys,  because I've seen so much,  because me,  I shot to the middle  and I clung there  in my career.  So I've seen guys  come up and go down,  you know what I mean?  And Paulie was one of them.  Yeah.  Remember Ralph Harris?  Yes.  Ralph Harris was one  of those guys.  He was,  hey,  Don Herrera,  you know,  I'm in Philly,  you're my man,  an idol.  He gets a series  and he comes in  a laugh factory  and he goes,  hey,  how you doing,  man?  And he does,  and he just keeps like  blows by me. 
[04:05:30]  And then like,  you know,  the series got dropped  in about six weeks  and then he comes  in the laugh factory,  Tom,  how you doing?  I go,  hey,  how you doing,  man?  You know what I mean?  Yep,  of course.  His brother Ramon  was doing comedy too,  did you know Ramon?  Yeah,  yeah,  I worked with him  at Rascals or something.  Hey,  who else was on that  top ten list in L.A.?  I know Ellen was number one  on the cover of the magazine.  Well,  it wasn't just stand-ups,  Larry David was on it  and the guys who write  South Park.  Right.  Matt Trey.  Yeah,  and who else?  Zach Galifianakis?  No,  he wasn't on the top ten. 
[04:06:00]  He was like a new guy  coming up or something.  Oh,  okay.  They had like a thing  about him.  But I mean,  how can you have a,  and not to be like  the Sammy Morland show,  but how can you have  a list like that  and you not be on it?  I mean,  it's ridiculous.  Me?  Yeah.  Oh,  I don't live in L.A. though.  Yeah,  but well,  I mean,  that kind of,  to me,  I mean,  Chris Rock doesn't live  in L.A. either.  I mean,  you're one of the funniest  comedians there.  I don't get it.  Oh,  thank you.  Oh,  look at that.  I'm serious.  Thank you.  No,  I'm very rarely out there.  I'm really not on the radar  in L.A. at all. 
[04:06:30]  You know,  I'm not just saying that  because what are you going  to get me,  the stress factor?  I know,  I'm going to put it  away with Vinny.  Right.  All right,  Dom,  anything else on your mind today?  No,  everything's good.  I just woke up real early  to talk to you guys.  I hope to get into the studio  next time.  Yeah,  that'd be good.  I got so much feedback  the last time I was on,  man.  It was great.  Well,  our fans are very,  very loyal,  my brother.  I want to tell you,  you know,  how like you kind of  start thinking maybe  you're making it a little.  I pull up this,  because this reminds me  of Bananas.  I pull up to the Lincoln Tunnel  and I give the woman, 
[04:07:00]  a beautiful black woman  with like dreadlocks,  I give her the money  and she takes a beat  and she looks at me,  she hands it back  and she goes,  it's on me.  I saw you at the banana club.  You cracked me up.  You know,  and I thought,  wow,  I really did make it.  I'm getting like  the free tunnel.  Wow,  I'm getting you a free tunnel.  That's making it.  Does anybody else  see the irony  in what she looked like  and what club she saw in that?  All right.  Very nice. 
[04:07:30]  All right,  Dom,  next time you come in  and hang for the whole morning,  that would be great.  All right,  look forward to it.  Thanks.  We'd love to have you.  All right,  see you,  man.  There he goes,  Dom Marrera.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony is scared  of home invasions  in his area  and he can't sleep at night.  The news got me  with that one.  Different ways  Ant can defend himself  are discussed  in this next  Opie and Anthony bit.  Home invasions  on the rise.  What does it mean to you?  It scared me.  It did.  So I guess, 
[04:08:00]  yeah,  we got into a whole discussion  on how I could best  defend myself.  As you know,  I only carry a rapier,  a sword.  Do you know,  there are times  when I get scared,  too.  I get so scared.  I'm afraid  of a home invasion.  All right,  let's just play the bit.  We got nothing.  The worst  of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah!  Bopper!  I'm just,  I'm just a little beat. 
[04:08:30]  A little exhausted.  I just,  I have to get this  off my chest quickly.  The news  has gotten me  scared shitless  and because of it,  I can't sleep.  I really,  I'm serious.  I have,  last night,  I probably got  the least sleep  that I have gotten  since we started  working here.  It's total sleepless  nights now  for a couple of nights  because the news  has me all wound up.  Newsday.  Spike,  in home invasions  feared. 
[04:09:00]  Seems a Massapeco couple  out on Long Island  and their son  were awoken  early Monday morning  by two armed robbers  who locked them  in the bathroom  and ran away  with their cash  and jewelry.  Nassau police said.  Nassau County,  Long Island.  The incident  put the number  of home invasions  in Nassau  to 17 so far  this year.  More than twice  the number  that occurred  in all of 2004.  Now it's only 17  but they have me  all scared  because they said  the home invasions  two patterns 
[04:09:30]  of home invasions  one in the five  towns area  of Long Island  the other  in Old Westbury  Lake Success  vicinity.  I live in  Lake Success.  So they're telling  they said that  late at night  they enter the homes  through an open window  or an unlocked door  something like that  I don't think  they've been breaking  anything  and tying people up  locking them in a room  and robbing them.  So now I hear this 
[04:10:00]  on the news  I punch it up  on the website  and I'm like  alright  it happens  whatever.  So I try to go to sleep  and every little  creek I hear now  every little  maybe a little  acorn  falling off a tree  and hitting the roof  or something  I'm up  I'm up  freaked out  waiting for some  animal to come  in my room.  Do you have a good  alarm system?  I'm just scared  waiting for  first of all  I wouldn't say  on the air 
[04:10:30]  if I have an alarm  system or not.  I have a great  alarm system  in that house.  I would get  like that  Indiana Jones  big ball  that rolls out  when they move  that statue head.  It's already  got that in his pants.  It's just  you know  they scare  the crap out of me  because now  I can't sleep  because every sound  I hear  I think is  somebody breaking  into the house  and alarm is great  you know  someone decides  to throw something  through your  sliding glass window  run in  for a big  hit and run  like that  what are you  going to do? 
[04:11:00]  You know  so now  I can't sleep  I'm not  I'm serious  I cannot sleep  now  I was up  every hour  last night  here's what you  did  you get the  advanced alarm  system which  will wake you  and you guys  sleep in one  area of the house  and I know  a guy in porn  who does this  this might sound  crazy  get yourself  a gun  get a gun  keep it in your  room  and if anybody  breaks in  you pull your  pistol out  man  because the  alarm will  alert you  that they're  there  there's no way  they're going  to get anywhere  near your room 
[04:11:30]  before I can  pull out the  heat  before you can  pull out your  pistol man  lay down some  lid  absolutely  you pull out  a pistol  get night vision  goggles  as crazy as  that sounds  shut the lights  out  put on the  night vision  I'd rather  swing like a  Mossberg  just in case  there's a couple  of them  I don't want to  have to be  good with a  single shot  get a shotgun  that's what I  mean  get a nice  Mossberg  riot gun  I say you get  a panic room  I'm loving the  idea of a panic  room where just  metal slides down 
[04:12:00]  in front of the  doors and windows  in my bedroom  and I'm just  in there going  I don't care  what you take  it's all  insured  go ahead  you want to  get me  okay look  I'll open the  door for like a  second  then I'll shut  it again  here we go  and no I'm  not going to  open the door  idiot  I'm in here  you can't get  me  where's the DVD  where's the DVD  player  N word  oh no you  didn't  oh no you

[04:15:30]  and he went  out back  and he used  to have this  friggin 357  magnum  that was just  ridiculous  I remember  shooting it  as a kid  and you might  as well  have just lit  an M80  in your hand  and held it  that's what it  felt like  just you'd feel  this thing  explode  and he went  outside  and I love  how in his  inimitable style  how he told  the story  because it  was a black  gentleman  although he  didn't quite  use those words  I called him  a fella  you should have  seen this  big end  he was scared  shitless  laid down 
[04:16:00]  on the ground  and he held  him there  and called  the cops  and they  arrested him  so he didn't  shoot him  but it was  always fun  like that  around my house  some big  man was  trying to  break into  my shed  held him  there at  gunpoint  fine example  of a home  invasion  which was  almost stopped  was Richard  Ramirez  the night  stalker  was obviously  committing  murders  and barbaric  rapes  and breaks  into this  couple's  house  he shoots  the husband  on the couch 
[04:16:30]  he runs  in to get  the wife  they're old  people  she has a  shotgun under  the bed  she pulls  it out  and points  it at him  I remember  this  and he  stopped  in his  tracks  and she  fucking  pulls  the trigger  click  click  click  their grandchildren  had come  that week  so they  had unloaded  the gun  click  so he then  proceeds to  kill her  now this  dummy  should have  just pointed  the gun  at him  and made  him leave  right  and I'm  sure he  would have  left  you don't  you don't  question  a shotgun  hard language  you get  out of here  get the hell 
[04:17:00]  out  I don't  care how  much  you think  he's on  your side  I don't  care how  many bad  teeth  Puerto Ricans  with their  pants  tucked into  their socks  break  into my  house  well you  know  something  she should  have  pointed  the shotgun  at him  but  she wanted  to kill  him  she was  assuming  it was  loaded  probably  surprised  the shit  out of her  when it  just went  click  do you know  the sound  how horrible  that must  be when he  stops  and you  hear  click  and then  he comes  towards  you  and you  hear  another  click  and you  like  oh no  then he  has a nice  big smile 
[04:17:30]  on his  face  they're  dead  they're  dead  click  lord  won't you  buy me  a mercedes  bed  my friends  all dry  portions  I must  make  a man  work hard  all my life  with no  help  from my  friend  shut your  yas  oh lord  won't you  buy me  a mercedes  bed  shoot him  now  shoot him  now  not  on your  goddamn

[04:20:30]  Today's episode, Recipe for Murder.  M-M-I-V.  The Opie and Anthony Show, Act One.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Today's episode, Eat, Drink, and Be Murdered.  With special guest star, Robert Conrad. 
[04:21:00]  A Quinn Martin production.  A Quinn Martin production.  Opie and Anthony, today's episode, Hide and Go Murder.  M-M-I-V.  Epilogue.  We're not at the epilogue yet.  All right.  That's during What Did We Learn?  Yeah.  The epilogue will be What Did We Learn?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Today's episode, Hickory Dickory Murder. 
[04:21:30]  Oh, God.  Yeah, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the O-N-A virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  And we want to say hi to everyone that got their XM radios turned on overnight.  Turn it on.  And by the way, you know, let's put an end to this.  We are not moving back to afternoon radio.  We did it.  We kicked serious ass.  Yeah.  And we're moving on with this new venture, okay?  People are begging us at times to move back to afternoons.  We're just not going to do it. 
[04:22:00]  I'm one of those people begging.  Believe me.  Honestly, our lives would be a lot better.  Yeah.  But we already did that.  And it just doesn't make sense when you're doing a national radio show now.  Right.  Because, you know, we're known on the East Coast big time.  Big effing time.  But the whole West Coast is now listening to us as well, okay?  And you can't, if we're doing afternoons in the New York Times zone,  you can't give the West Coast a show that's 24 hours old in the morning.  You just can't do it.  Doesn't work.  So let's stop the discussion. 
[04:22:30]  We're here to stay.  We want to make this work.  Plus, we're kind of sleepy in the morning and a lot of crazy stuff comes out.  A little punchy.  Yeah, like this freaking recipe for murder stuff.  Opie and Anthony show.  Today's episode, Stop in the Name of Murder.  A Quinn Martin production.  Opie and Anthony on after Cannon on CBS. 
[04:23:00]  Yeah, we got in here early.  We were getting the show together and just started talking about the old TV programs.  TV shows.  Don't you miss them sometimes?  I was just noticing everyone has to be beautiful on TV these days.  And we brought up Cannon for some reason and then Kojak.  And Opie said he caddied for Telly Savalas.  I caddied for Telly Savalas.  I don't even know, man. 
[04:23:30]  I guess probably in the mid-80s or something like that.  Give me a putter, baby.  He came to the Huntington Crescent Club and the guy was missing all sorts of parts off  his body.  Yeah, but it didn't matter back then.  You know, supposedly he had a fake ear on the show.  Yeah, they put a fake ear on him and it was missing like a finger or something, piece of  his finger.  He was missing a couple digits.  A couple of digits?  I think so, and I do remember seeing like no ear.  Hey, caddy, look for my ear in the woods over there.  Come on, baby. 
[04:24:00]  Who loves you, baby?  Where's my golf ball?  He was playing golf and sucking on the lollipops and his trademark lollipop.  Oh, yeah, and he would walk to his ball.  Where's my ball, baby?  He had a big Aaron Neville mole on his cheek and stuff.  And he was like one of the hottest stars in Hollywood.  Yeah.  The guy was all over television.  You couldn't.  Oh, there you go.  Kojak, a Quid Martin production.  M-C-M-L-X-X-I-I. 
[04:24:30]  Uh, what?  You always got to figure out what year it was.  That would be 1970-something.  Tonight's episode, recipe for murder.  With special guest star, Charo.  Charo?  Charo.  Coochie, coochie girl.  Yeah, Kojak would walk into a nightclub and she'd be performing.  And she'd have to help Kojak find the clues.  And Kojak got all the babes, even though he was a mess. 
[04:25:00]  Oh, he'd walk into some of those clubs to, like, get some info from some informant or something.  And the girls would come up, and the girls would come up, and the girls would come up, hey, Kojak.  Hey, baby.  You'd be hugging them.  Like, ugh.  Like, you talk to my mole, and I'm going to talk to this woman over here.  Ugh, baby.  A Quid Martin production.  They put them all out.  Mannix.  Mannix.  Oh, my God.  Mannix was the private investigator.  It was, like, $100 a day plus expenses. 
[04:25:30]  Whoa.  What an expensive guy.  And Cannon, the big fat guy, Cannon.  And the opening sequence wasn't believable.  He's running around in the hills of California with a little six-shooter chasing some guy.  Cannon's not catching anyone.  And then, I kind of liked it because he was the first guy.  He had the first portable phone.  Right.  First car phone ever.  And I thought it was the coolest thing.  And it was a phone with the little spindly cord like you'd have at home that went into the hump in the middle of his console. 
[04:26:00]  And he'd pick it up and go, mobile operator, get me Klondike 51350.  Right away.  Right away, Mr. Cannon.  Like, he couldn't make a call.  He couldn't just dial a number.  Mobile operator.  I need 555-8383.  What was bigger, Cannon's phone or the little doggy company's satellite radio? 
[04:26:30]  Ooh, good question.  I have the Cannon satellite radio.  It's huge.  Whoa, is that the Cannon theme?  They'd be playing this music, and it's a whole montage of scenes on the screen of him running, chasing, and even womanizing.  You love my fat, don't you?  Back then, you didn't have to be pretty to be on TV.  Now, you know, you've got to look like the cast of the OC or Smallville or something in order to be on television. 
[04:27:00]  That's why poor little Jimmy Norton doesn't get all the parts that he should get.  He's a great little actor, but perhaps, you know, people like me and Jimmy, you just can't get on television.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I'm not that good of an actor.  What was that other show?  We were talking, I was talking with your brother.  McMillan and Wife?  McMillan and Wife.  A Quinn Martin production.  It's a nice name.  It's the good old days, right?  McMillan and the bitch he has sex with. 
[04:27:30]  Just end wife.  McMillan and the girl he's with tonight.  McMillan and still friends.  McMillan and ex-wife, but still on good terms.  A Quinn Martin production.  Or Banachek.  Banachek.  Who was the pitch meeting for that show?  Okay, it's going to be great.  Wait, wasn't that?  Hold on, I got to go backwards.  Wasn't Rock Hudson McMillan?  Yes, he was.  Gay guy.  And he was always, you know, very loving with Susan St. James, who was wife. 
[04:28:00]  She played wife.  Wife.  And they would solve crimes together.  Ugh, what a nightmare that would be.  What are you doing?  It probably started out, yeah.  Why aren't you home yet?  I'm working.  Why can't I come along with you?  Right.  She probably didn't believe him and had a tag along.  I'm McMillan.  I'm a cop.  I got work to do. 
[04:28:30]  I'm the guy.  I'm your wife.  I'm the guy.  I should be by your side supporting you and solving crimes.  Ugh.  You know, one of these days you're going to turn me gay, woman.  Ugh.  I'd rather have AIDS than take you along.  Oh, I do?  On tonight's episode, watch McMillan's T-cell count drop.  McMillan and wife try to track down his T-cells.  Tonight's episode, butt sex for murder.  For murder. 
[04:29:00]  Murder.  Yeah, Banachek was, what was his name?  The actor?  I can't remember.  That would be George Pappard.  George Pappard, who later went on to the A-team.  Yes, George Pappard.  And breakfast at Tiffany's.  And breakfast at Tiffany's, yes.  George Pappard was Banachek.  Banachek, and the plot was he worked for an insurance company.  And he would go around trying to find missing insured stuff. 
[04:29:30]  What a great show.  Always with a drink and a cigar.  And he'd put on his gloves and try to track down, like, missing boxcars and missing vases.  That was insured for a million bucks.  My company doesn't want to pay for that.  I'm going to track it down.  I believe you had it stolen.  And the whole episode is him tracking down some merchandise that was insured by his company.  Oh, who's watching that? 
[04:30:00]  Banachek.  A lot of people did back in the day.  Oh, what about the...  Ode to a missing armoire.  M-C-M-L-X-X-I-V.  That was made in the 1800s, I think.  How is that possible?  Oh, Banachek was made in 1882.  We didn't even know we were going to do this today.  We just were goofing around before the show.  I loved it, though.  But when you said recipe for murder. 
[04:30:30]  Recipe for murder.  With the cheesy graphic.  Now it's all about Flash, you know.  You watch a TV show, the opening credits get awards now.  Because they're all done, it's a CGI and very flashy.  That was like typewriter written stuff superimposed on bad stuff they cut out of episodes.  It was all shaky.  You know, you'd see the recipe for murder and it's shaking on the screen.  What does that say?  What? 
[04:31:00]  Loved it.  Grew up watching all that Quinn Martin crap.  Let's go to a gym in North Carolina.  The streets of San Francisco.  And there's a guy, Carl Malden, who just did not belong on TV.  Another guy that didn't belong on TV.  Big alcohol ravaged cauliflower nose.  And Michael Douglas is on that one.  That was his first big break before he started hitting colored people in the balls with golf balls.  And laughing about it on the golf bars.  The streets of San Francisco. 
[04:31:30]  Tonight's episode, vagot murder.  Come on, San Francisco.  MCMLXX.  Fam.  V.  V.  1975.  Running around the streets of San Francisco solving gay crime.  Cross-dressing murder. 
[04:32:00]  All the groovy music solving gay crime.  Gay crime in San Francisco.  Tonight's episode, Michael Douglas goes undercover in a bathhouse to find the killer of gay men.  In Get Me a Towel, I've Been Murdered.  Tonight's episode, I Left My Murder in San Francisco.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:32:30]  Let's say hi to Jim in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, what's going on, O&A?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, originally from Jersey.  I'm a Marine station down here, but glad you guys are back on the air.  Oh, cool, bro.  Hey, remember Vegas with Dan Tanna?  Yeah, he had a bunch of shows.  In Vegas.  What was the one where he was in Boston?  Oh, that was, uh, um, uh, uh, Ben's got the, uh, uh, the squirts today, so.  Spencer for hire. 
[04:33:00]  Our Boston connection's not here.  Spencer for hire.  With the black-eyed hawks.  Spencer.  Spencer for hire.  All right, thank you, Jim.  Hi.  Oh, yeah, Bob's got one of my old favorites.  Bob and Jamestown.  Literally, old favorites.  Good.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, fella.  Hey, Barnaby Jones.  You haven't mentioned it.  Barnaby Jones.  That's a great pitch, too.  I'd love to be in the pitch meeting for that.  Yeah, uh, there's, how many detective shows are on now?  Uh, there's 87 on all the networks. 
[04:33:30]  I got one more.  But the guy's 80 years old.  What about a detective who's 80 years old?  What?  Yeah, Barnaby Jones.  Barnaby Jones, the geriatric gumshoe.  Tonight's episode, I'd love to catch the murderer, but my prostate's in place.  Barnaby Jones, M-C-M-L-X-X-B-I.  1971.  Very early in the decade, 1971. 
[04:34:00]  It's Barnaby Jones, Act One.  Barnaby.  What was his son's...  Oh, he didn't have a son.  He was a nephew.  Jebediah.  Jebediah.  Jebediah Jones.  Because that was the young...  Because you've got to get, like, a young guy in there to get the chicks.  To get all the little hippie chicks of the day that were biting into hot dogs and screaming  because they were talking back to them.  Another guy that looked like he shouldn't be on TV.  Yeah, you're putting an 80-year-old guy on television running around, another guy running 
[04:34:30]  around chasing young hoods, and he's 80 years old.  Yeah, old guy.  Barnaby Jones.  And the bad guys are always the same guys on all the shows.  You'd have, like, John Cassavetes or that dude from The Man from Uncle.  Man from Uncle.  That guy, I forget his name.  Robert Vaughn.  Robert Vaughn, exactly.  Tonight's guests are Robert Vaughn.  That's my brother Darren, by the way.  The king of useless information. 
[04:35:00]  It's ridiculous what he remembers.  Hairpiece for murder starring Robert Vaughn.  Comodiver or murder.  I love those shows.  I can hear the murder thing all day now.  Every episode.  Just all day, just come up with another one.  Very original.  Oh, which one's this?  I don't know this one.  This says The Girl from Uncle, not The Man from Uncle.  Oh, jeez. 
[04:35:30]  I thought I was going to hear one of the classics.  The Girl on Her Uncle.  That stinks.  Was that an actual TV show?  Yeah.  Barnaby Jones.  Let's go to Wayne in PA.  Tonight's episode wasn't murder or did I just forget?  Wayne, what's up?  Hey, what's wrong, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you're missing one.  Don't forget the Hawaii Five-0 there.  Book them, Dan-o.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That was another one when they had those stupid car phones. 
[04:36:00]  It was like a receiver from a rotary phone there.  Did you yank it out the window?  Yeah, they would pull like regular phones and they'd be in their car talking on the phone.  But as a kid, it was like, this is the coolest guy ever.  I used to think Mannix was like the coolest guy ever.  Detective, womanizing, kind of drinking, smoking.  And that $100 a day plus expenses.  It's just like, God, he's raking in some heavy-duty cash.  Beginning, he's running across that bridge.  Someone's chasing him. 
[04:36:30]  Not afraid to run, Mannix.  Mannix, run away for murder.  Oh, yeah.  Real jazzy.  They'd always end up trying to get information in those lounge-like, lowly-lit clubs.  With the red candle on the table and the big button-tough red couches.  And sit down with a martini.  Spill it.  Spill it.  All right, Mannix.  Yeah, I was there.  But I didn't do it, I swear.  All right, you lousy hood. 
[04:37:00]  Go.  Take a walk.  He's got enough info.  Well, what time is it?  Three o'clock?  I made $100.  I could go home and go to sleep now.  Mannix.  Barely ever worked.  He's on the job like two hours a day.  That's enough.  I'll solve the murder tomorrow on Mannix.  M-C-M-L-X-X.  Hmm.  E-V-I.  1976?  Oh, very good.  All right.  You also had Harry O., which was like a Mannix light kind of. 
[04:37:30]  Harry O., right.  And that was, what the hell was his name?  David Jansen.  David Jansen.  He died early from, he probably lived a life when he was off the air.  Lived a life he was portrayed on television.  Yeah.  David Jansen from The Fugitive.  Scott in Ohio.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, what about Beretta?  Yeah, well, that's kind of how we originally started talking about this before the show even started.  That's right, because Robert Blake, three years after he allegedly killed his wife, woman there, 
[04:38:00]  he's still in jail, and now they're just picking a jury.  And we were saying, what the hell happened to a speedy trial?  If this isn't a case of being denied your constitutional right to a speedy trial, three years, and no one's talking about that.  It's not anything I read in any of the news reports.  Why can they hold this guy for three years before bringing him to trial? 
[04:38:30]  Unbelievable.  Got to let him out.  It's not a flight risk.  Where's he going to hide?  Where's Beretta going?  Where's old Beretta going?  Young Beretta might have fled.  Come on.  I'm leaving with you, rummy.  The old rummy.  Yeah, that's how that started.  Yeah.  Oh, I loved Beretta.  I used to watch that every week.  Keep your eye on the sparrow.  You remember that.  We're in the door.  Sammy Davis. 
[04:39:00]  Yeah, babe.  Oh, Sammy sung this?  Yeah.  Don't go to bed.  Oh, yeah, there you go.  No price on your head.  No, no.  Don't do it.  Should have taken the advice of his song before he shot his wife.  Don't do the crime if you can through the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, groovy.  Big Afro black people on the show.  Lie on the sparrow.  That is kakatu. 
[04:39:30]  Bread.  Bread.  Bread.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's narrow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  M-C-M-L-X-X.  V-I-I-I-V.  Where can I go?  Hello.  No.  I-I-I.  I-I-I.  I-I-I would work.  Sure.  Stupid Roman numerals.  Why didn't they just put the date at the bottom of it? 
[04:40:00]  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve the Bear.  Sweet face, so cozy.  We go back to his place and in his cave he shows me his flame hat.  I wonder how he can wear that, wonder how many cubs got caught in his bear trap.  His flaming clothes are exotic, homoerotic, and like Steve, it should have never came out the closet. 
[04:40:30]  But if you wear it, the sideburn's got to be in good shape.  Can't be a cozy bear if your hair don't look great.  Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Sweet Steve.  Steve the Bear.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Larry King.  Hey Larry King, the Motley Crue.  Michael Jackson's lawyer was on Larry King, telling the nation Jacko would not be sleeping with boys anymore. 
[04:41:00]  And Larry only asks the hard-hitting questions, doesn't he?  He stinks.  What an ass head.  Are my suspenders red?  He really should just have a shotgun blasted into his chest.  Fucking married five times.  Five, I think you're being nice.  Yeah.  I think it's more than that.  He's got a little kid.  Does he really?  Yeah.  Awful.  Well, Larry King in this next bit, he asks the tough questions. 
[04:41:30]  Like he does on a nightly basis.  What a total non-journalist he is.  He just makes me ill.  His awful slick back hair.  War of the Worlds.  Tell me about it.  He's had every major celebrity and president on.  And old fucko can't ask a tough question.  Fuck off.  Is Michael still going to wear glittered shoes?  These are the important questions.  Ugh.  Ugh.  What about you, man?  Ugh.  Why does my prostate look like a sun-dried raisin? 
[04:42:00]  There it is.  You know how funny it was the other night when Vos was talking about his, uh, uh, what was it?  A colonostomy?  Oh, well, where they said it.  Colonostomy.  He said colonostomy?  Yeah, instead of colonoscopy.  Colonoscopy?  Colonoscopy.  He said colonoscopy.  Colonostomy.  He called it surgery, too.  Wouldn't a colonostomy be them removing your colon? 
[04:42:30]  I don't think it's a word.  It's not surgery, is it?  Officially?  Ugh.  Maybe minor surgery?  No.  It's lovin'.  I like to call it lovin'.  The last thought of hysterectomy is when they took a man's directomy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
[04:43:00]  not a pedophile it's going to take michael jackson is not a pedophile he's  never been a pedophile  the prosecution has spent years trying to put together a story which they hope  they can prove and failed it to prove michael jackson is not a pedophile he's  never molested a child nor would he ever even conceive of doing such a thing  so these were concocted stories 
[04:43:30]  well certainly they were concocted by the main accusers and and certainly the  prosecution tried to create the impression that other people are  molested and they all came in and said they weren't  hmm  didn't one of the kids uh know what his penis look like yes why yeah and i would  a larry king say why did he pay them off  why you pay them off and how is a child going to know with michael jackson's  penis look did larry king ask those questions  no why you softball lobbying fucking nine why having nothing yeah the motley 
[04:44:00]  crew the motley crew  larry king stinks he really does just throw softball question why don't you  ask why okay mark and he never has a follow-up question ever  why and you think the lawyer would actually have an answer for that he would  have lawyer talk for how well you know sometimes in a case you have to hey well  look why let's ask this why did he pay off kids why do you ask michael that michael has  been a victim of this kind of thing in the past and he paid this off to minimize the bad press that he would have 
[04:44:30]  twenty five million dollars didn't do it twenty five millions okay he's a pedophile  children in the ass i got him off i'm famous now let's go to eric in new york city and ask michael why he hired rutger howard to be his lawyer  that's good eric what's up good morning boys morning make it fast we got to get back to this audio  if you remember hurrah they're talking about professionalism he was giving away  ordinance in the sand of where the troops were at this war yeah remember that he got thrown out of 
[04:45:00]  iraq by the united states military another thing i want to mention that this garagos guy  uh uh the the lawyer for for for jackson do you remember he he they got they switched attorneys  with scott peterson right he was defending peterson trial right right right so peterson  technically should have stayed with that attorney he would walk now i don't know about that the uh yes  i don't think so mesero is good though man this guy's a great lawyer and look i don't fault him he's 
[04:45:30]  doing his job the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt and they i never faulted cock when  either lawyers are doing jealously guarding the the whatever the rights of their clients the interest  of their clients that's their job yeah it's their job but he was just this the scummy race card play  and wait you're right absolutely the discrediting uh the cop uh you know just because um firman was a  racist agreed using uh naughty language doesn't mean he planted a glove anywhere agreed oj running past 
[04:46:00]  that air conditioner bangs into it the time is perfect for him running and then getting in and answering  the doorbell like the guy's been ringing for 15 minutes the guy obviously did it and they explained  it all the way as mark firman planted it because he had some kind of vendetta against black people  but darden saying try the glove on marcia clark didn't talk to him for a week after that i know  that blunder with no payoff yeah and it didn't fit because of whatever reason but i mean try the glove  on this jury doesn't want to convict him they don't want to convict oj soak a leather glove in blood 
[04:46:30]  and let it sit for a while that thing is going to contract up and not fit it was all crushed it  was it was crushed and and the way you try to make it look like you're putting a glove on you  can take a regular glove i can make it look like it's not right right that's all your fingers up  exactly when you're getting he had a plastic glove underneath it when you're getting when you're  getting set for a murder you're not putting on perfect clothes if i i mean stupid me if i was  going to do a murder i'd get baggy clothes just in case gloves that wouldn't fit two different size  shoes at the shoes there are two people here with each with one leg drag a tail behind you a genius 
[04:47:00]  what murder makes sure that his outfit is perfect you know i wear a size nine half ten shoe i did i'd  get twelve yeah you know just to throw it throw it all off obviously they were killed by a bunch of  brontosaurus you can see it was a pack of raptors they were dragging tails and oj exaggerated the  oh i was acting it looked like the naked gun i would have had the lawyers there i would have 
[04:47:30]  said look come on no try that glove on you know what are you doing you get you know what you do  you get a guy with a bigger hand than oj to slide it right on and go look tell the actor to put this  on like he did that night but garton is an incompetent and marcia clark that dumb broad he was  too worried about her image johnny cochran you dumb bitch because the la prosecute they didn't want  to get a white guy to prosecute a black man so they got a black man and a white woman because they  figured that would be less threatening for the jury yeah that's what you get for thinking in those  terms you deserve always do you get it you get a guy that's up on rape charges he will always have 
[04:48:00]  a woman lawyer always always have a woman lawyer and his lawyers ferocious yeah she's good yeah and  you know what cochran was undefeated in la he never lost to those la prosecute he was undefeated  because he was good and they were incompetent i'm sorry they're not good  and i met one of those guys one of those guys came into the comedy cell the guy who was originally  supposed to prosecute the case but had heart problems yeah a white guy with a beard you'd 
[04:48:30]  know him if you saw him he was in all the footage um yeah i can't remember his name hodgman bill  hodgman uh but he had some kind of a heart murmur or something so they took him off the case that  was the excuse they gave and he came in he signed an autograph for me he just wrote jim he he was guilty  bill hodgman didn't write his name really yeah that's pretty cool cochran did lose one case  the case of old pudding brain that's right what are you doing there's a softball on the brain stem  softball versus the brain stem couldn't talk his way out of that yeah well if what doesn't fit 
[04:49:00]  the old the hat now because there's a lump on the top of your skull oh wow if that doesn't fit you  must remove it  all right getting back to the michael jackson thing let's go to randy in new york randy what's up  up guys hey um anthony you said before that the prosecution lacked a load of evidence  actually they lacked the load as evidence yeah well that would have worked too  just like the clinton thing they had nothing on them until they found that load you gotta find the load 
[04:49:30]  you gotta scrape that uh mashed potato mix yeah off the uh buttocks all right speaking of uh a little  petri dish lawyers here here's michael jackson's lawyer larry king last night uh he discusses the  the issue of sleeping with children and well first of all larry this notion that he sleeps with boys  was a concoction by the prosecution really said very openly was that he allows families into his room  now his room is the size of a duplex it's two levels all right hold on hold on no lawyer ass 
[04:50:00]  what he said in an interview that was videotaped that i personally saw as did millions of other  people was it's a wonderful thing to share your bed with a child with a child beautiful it's beautiful  exactly he talked about how he shared his bed with children but this lying fuck will sit there and  spew out these lies what larry said did larry call him yeah how about going well what about this clip 
[04:50:30]  play the videotape i understand you collect keys yeah you know yeah exactly how did you get started  with that hobby god that is it perfect that is that is that is perfect larry king you see the new  softballs revenge of the city yeah he'll just go off on a left hand what just what just flew past your  head larry that was a softball arcing at me that i just didn't see what larry responded maybe larry  had a good reply let's go back to the tape he's had mothers sleep their fathers sleep their sisters 
[04:51:00]  sleep their brothers sleep their the prosecution concocted this little saying about sleeping with  boys because they thought it would turn off the jury and they fail but yes we did have to explain who  michael jackson was to the jury but he's a very creative spirit every gentle soul a brilliant musician a  brilliant choreographer had a funny very sensitive person who's very concerned about the world of them  the problems in the world and he has a very childlike spirit in essence to him and he attracts children  all over the world there's not yet to explain who he was but this is a country which prides itself on 
[04:51:30]  diversity on the freedom to be who you are i'll bet they never diverted our attention from who michael  was we never tried to make him look like anything but himself he never tried to address him in the  courtroom our whole intention was to show who michael is and be proud of it and embrace it  hell the lawyer is brilliant he answered the question make michael look good and just kept  going on and then had a monologue about how great michael jackson diversity diversity in his country  larry that's larry responsibility somebody nudged larry you know it's diverse those kellogg's snack packs 
[04:52:00]  i love how diverse you could go from special k right to frosted flakes that's diversity we'll be back  after this you're a friggin idiot ask him a question larry king is a bum he's a bum larry king is a bum  what a maroon ask a question confront this guy challenge him that's why larry king is so famous 
[04:52:30]  because everybody wants to be interviewed by this this no tough question asking mox yeah he is an  absolute mouthpiece for whoever's on trial whoever's that's all you are larry is a mirror for them to  say what they want to say diversity michael jackson is one of his members you know i know sandy kofax  well what about the martin basheer thing where michael said he likes to share his bed mark  yeah why didn't larry jump in it's your show you suspenders wearing just bucket jump in  you know what i don't care do you take garlic i love garlic available at drugstores around the 
[04:53:00]  country garlic is wonderful that's right it'll take this the smell of small boy duty off your helmet  oh larry king should have a stroke on his wedding day on his next wedding day  married eight nine times oh that is funny man nothing he's got no balls god what a coward and a  non-journalist confront the guy challenge in sixty minutes they get in there with a pencil and you 
[04:53:30]  just you're like you're getting in the ass beaten the hell out of you let's go to another clip i was  going to blow your real intentions for curing aids what i'm a good guy here yes i hear there were  ulterior motives one night came up with a cure that's all i want to talk about all right here's  uh... them talking about uh... well then it's going to be the lawyer talking about uh... media pundits  anthony i think that uh... we have developed an industry of would-be experts who are not 
[04:54:00]  professional who are not experienced who are very amateurish in their comments about what's going  on in court rooms carol channing uh... talk about us when we do these clips is there any larry question  who did the clips is this edited did you edit out all of larry king's questions  i want to hear some of larry's questions i want larry's questions i want them answered immediately  that's right yeah we might have to uh... revisit this i would be forced to ask you idiots 
[04:54:30]  go back to the media pundits thing runs and who are willing to give opinions when they're not even  there and i think it has become the theater of the absurd and i think it reached its lowest level  in this case speaking of theater have you seen billy joe's musical the obvious uh... among people  like court tv who i felt was really an arm of the prosecution through this case um it was very  amateurish and very unprofessional and very disturbing and that's ned and his on his ben hairdo 
[04:55:00]  he goes to ben's ben's barber it's a guy with a column on the end of a baseball bat  that guy is up for lawsuits now which is kind of good to see a lawyer be well because he's just a  bum too he deserves to lose his credibility the applicant is a bum that's right drummed out of  the prosecution business how long have you known the applicant too long the applicant is a bum  all right listen let's get past the uh... the larry king clubs we got two more quick ones the lawyer 
[04:55:30]  for michael jackson talking about the issue of celebrity justice um i'll tell you what celebrity  injustice was in this case it was sending seventy sheriffs to raid michael jackson's home in a search  it was putting more experts more sheriffs and more investigators on this case than they do with serial  killers uh... that's what i call celebrity injustice so in a sense he's correct he just uh... is  looking at it the wrong way michael jackson was treated differently because he was a celebrity  way to go larry does and then i'll fuck over you does can you can you be a fucking man for one 
[04:56:00]  second and go excuse me wait wait okay hold on yeah can you for once interrupt the lawyer watch uh...  watch hardball that's how you do a show you jump in and just interrupt the guy scream at him call him  an ass or just go excuse me excuse me excuse me before you finish that thought can you at least once  cut him off so you go back and answer your get your question don't let him just profess his love for  michael jackson you bum what celebrity just i'll tell you what celebrity injustice i didn't ask you 
[04:56:30]  that yeah what celebrity justice all right when you're gonna make a cake what you have to do  they're telling guys they're telling me that larry king actually has a good question in this next  he does talking about race issue there were some jackson supporters concerned over the fact there was  there was no black on the jury but composite of that community of course there was a black alternate  were you concerned about the race issue  well certainly uh... michael jackson is part of a very very prominent african-american family and 
[04:57:00]  initially we did hope there would be some african-american representation on the jury  but once the jury was picked i always had a good feeling about this jury i always felt they were very  independent minded nobody was going to intimidate them they were going to take their job very seriously  and be very fair and uh... i was correct  no you weren't they were back to duane reed the babbling idiots they were when they showed up  now that they uh... said not guilty yeah if they would have said guilty 
[04:57:30]  there wasn't one black on the jury that's guaranteed this lawyer if they would have come back and said  guilty this lawyer would have been well the jury is racist i knew it there should have been more  african-americans on this jury that mark what's his name garagos garagos is a smooth talking son of a  bitch  we got one more waltz is listening when i only work with michael jackson he's my only client  one more here you like jurors who take notes 
[04:58:00]  uh...  uh... larry king  uh... could someone you know what do you like haagen-dazs  i do this is so creamy  nathaniel's right back to the office good this is the bit today  because we they just quickly got the clips for us for the show but you gotta get all the larry king  questions he stinks  do you like jurors that take notes  no i prefer a juror who dozes off you ass  listen to this again  you like jurors who take notes  uh... i don't know how to answer that way  i think note taking is an indication that someone's paying attention and very concerned 
[04:58:30]  about their job but on the other hand  you can also be paying attention and absorbing what's going on without taking notes so i don't  really know how to answer that question  i'm writing right what are you doing right now look at that here's the church  i'm just doodling  do you like doodling he can't believe what a dumb this is a lawyer for michael jackson  he can't believe what a what an awful question he should have he was just asked an awful question  do i ask why martin uh... why michael said he sleeps with boys on the martin basheer video no 
[04:59:00]  nah do you like jurors who take notes  yeah  do you like ice cream doc  why can't he go into room two three seven  what was he trying to bring into this situation  a cook  you know if you could drive a car you could drive a snowcat  i didn't know that  hello is anybody home 
[04:59:30]  we'll be back after these words kdk12 to kdk1  do you have garlic  delbert grady thursday  the only an anthony show  hello  hi what's up  okay my name is kyler and did it ever occur to you that you might have gay listeners who might be offended by the way you talk  oh no  um yeah we know we have gay listeners and they uh they enjoy our show  yeah well i'm a gay listener and i do enjoy listening but that kind of talk offends me  what offends you sir  as if it's assumed first of all the use of the word fag and homo like that 
[05:00:00]  well over and over again you're gonna have to get over that  that's what we do  yeah well you know there are other words to use to make it sound like it's really awful  that guys would think that you were that you were gay  well for a straight guy it is  no it isn't  no it isn't  no no no no no  because you're gay  see for a straight guy it's not good for his straight friends to think he's gay  that's reality  that's just the way it is  we're not going to change that perception 
[05:00:30]  i'm sorry but the average gay uh the average straight guy doesn't want to think that his pal is gay  yeah but i mean you wouldn't use the word you know words like nigger  you know you wouldn't you know in a different um sir we have used that word on this show  oh  we have used the word fag  yeah well i you know it's not just we have pretty much used every derogatory term on this show  it doesn't make it sound really awful and what if you're gonna you're gonna really offend gay  honestly let me tell you let me let me tell you something i don't really care if you're gay 
[05:01:00]  i really don't simple as that and i think if you listen to our show on a daily basis  i think people realize that we're just trying to have fun here well it might occur to you that  you know there might be some college guy who has is having a difficult time with it he hears stuff  like that that's not very encouraging you know i i personally am that's i've heard that excuse  from gay guys like all the time working in radio that's the big thing somebody trying to come out  is going to have a difficult time with it and stuff you know everybody's a lot of college your your 
[05:01:30]  attitude is this you know like a macho bar attitude it's that kind of humor you guys are  responsible for the sir sir let me stop you again we don't have a large uh young audience listening  to our radio show well i would say we have a lot of people with an open mind that then see it for  what it is which is pure humor and and trying to entertain people after a long uh day of work we  don't have time to be uh politically correct we really don't sorry i'm not politically you know  what there's enough people in our society trying to be politically correct we're 
[05:02:00]  trying to balance out the scale again so we're going the other way let me just say a few things  without being interrupted i'm not politically correct i'm not a gay activist frankly i'm  not even into all that stuff are you hot right uh yeah uh but i mean they have like tight buns  and stuff the thing is that you know i'm not into that stuff uh you know um but i'm listening to this  you know and i'm saying i can't believe this i'm calling for you know half an hour trying to get  through because we have you because we have a popular radio show because people are enjoying this 
[05:02:30]  and they're taking it for what it is just entertainment that's it well what do they say  one letter or one call is equivalent to what 200 opinions you know keep it in mind what i'm saying  whether you whether you want to fight me on it now do you have nice abs what i'm saying because it's  it's they have like a six pack and i'm not you know and i'm also i'm not i'm not overly come on  just laugh you know you want to laugh you know you want to laugh laugh offended by things in fact  there are many there are many gay guys and many things that i hate about gay world do you look

[05:03:30]  little rascal scooter listen when was the last time you got some yeah listen come on you want to  laugh i i hear it in your voice you're gay guy right it was how to be last night do you get any  calls like this am i the only one do you do you ever say no do you come on kyler it's funny you  know it is come on there's just so many i've got a good i've got a good sense of humor you guys do  you like judy garland no i don't i don't like barbara streisand and i don't like las minnelli i 
[05:04:00]  like rock and roll and i go to the boiler room because it's one of the few gay bars that plays good  rock and roll the boiler room yeah what a day i mean do they have to have such stereotypical names  it's a good place go to check it out go to the boiler room do they have like glory holes and stuff  no is it spelt like boy-ler room well that's a good point but no it's not it's not that kind of  be fun it was spelled like that right what i'm trying to say is you make it sound like the worst  thing in the world that other guys could think you were homos and so what if they did i mean 
[05:04:30]  you guys want to give your sperm great i mean it sounds really hot to me but you know wow wait a  minute kyler are you going to be turned on if we do this uh i'm actually quite well known in in would  you would you like to taste test no not these days come on kyler are you practicing safe sex of course  yeah why don't we get that why don't we get that message out to the community practice safe sex yeah 
[05:05:00]  that's more important uh-huh and maybe you can make it maybe you can use my name i'm can i ask  you how old you are yeah i'm 46. oh you oh wow you were in it like in the 70s and stuff yeah i'm  very lucky i'm very lucky because i'm negative that was a fun time for you guys huh yeah how scary  is it though scary as what well thinking you may come down with that i mean you're in the high  risk category six times and i'm negative but every time you get tested aren't you just like  completely freaking out yeah that's why i haven't done it in a long time really but they you see i'm 
[05:05:30]  i practice safe sex and i don't like to receive it so uh that picture makes me pretty safe that's  what us straight people call it listen you keep skirting the issue the issue is i think you should  apologize you can use my name if you want to kyler um honestly you know we just don't apologize for  what we do on our show okay well maybe i think i think it say something in a funny way hey you don't  mean to offend any gay guys you're just having fun you know you don't kyler honestly you really don't  listen to our show a lot because we have said things like that in the past okay no i don't i 
[05:06:00]  i i don't what the one thing and i try to do is try to make fun of pretty much everything uh-huh we  don't focus on the gays we don't focus on black people we don't focus on this group we just try to  we're just trying to have fun okay and if something hits us in the news or uh something we saw on our  way in then we're going to discuss and we're going to try to make it entertaining uh-huh and honestly we  know every time we talk we're offending someone out there we can't worry about it i mean i you know  i occasionally use the word fags you know because i can't stand guys that are like super fags and i'll 
[05:06:30]  say it you know and that's me it's like if you're you know if you're black you can use  see if you're jew you can see i don't agree with that theory either yeah i think if a black guy is  allowed to call another black guy a nigger then i should be able to do the same thing well what are you  what group are you in i'm a dago wop bastard so if somebody calls you a wop or whatever i don't  care actually uh i got a friend uh up in boston uh jay and he's irish and the most fun we have is 
[05:07:00]  ragging each other's culture like i'll send him uh things about uh like drunks and he sends me stuff  like spaghetti sauce and it's just constantly ragging each other's ethnic background and the worse it is  the funnier it gets uh-huh like he if if he's even uh near my car i check it for bombs because  he's irish some of the funniest stuff you gotta admit is this stuff that really pisses people off  you know i i think as a society we really got to start lightening up lightening up again well

[05:13:30]  that's what they do if they were fucking you probably wouldn't even hear about it wouldn't make this much of  a fuss over it no making sure there's eyewitnesses an eyewitness it's another publicist or somebody  that the publicist tipped off that they know talks to the press it's all set up all right you nailed it  i want to be linked to a pretty girl like that just so the papers can take a picture of me and  angelina on the beach who is this fat pig  you know that's the worst thing about about uh if if you were just a regular guy going out with 
[05:14:00]  one of these hot hollywood chicks you'd think it would be like the brad pitt story where they'd be  taking pictures oh what are they doing are they having here they are on the beach it would just be  a story about what is this slob doing with this gorgeous woman and it would be every bad picture of  you with her and just bashing you constantly i'd wear speedos all over the place my rotten gut my  appendix scar and she could just dote on me and touch my stomach would that be a great picture on the 
[05:14:30]  beach her laid out in the sun with a knee up maybe just kind of uh basking in the sunlight and you in  a speedo with your hands on your hips squinting like just looking up somewhere squinting huh like you're  like huh us checking in the hotels me like always looking at a pair of shorts with no socks and an  open like hawaiian shirt and she has to carry the bags she's carrying the bags i carry nothing you 
[05:15:00]  got a cup of coffee in your hand i don't tip i walk through the door i bark orders at her  come on with the bags what great pictures this would make man this cup of coffee you're walking like  five steps ahead of her yeah she's hustling the bags in there like de niro when he's walking down  the street to beat joe pesci in raging bull that type of an outfit with the awful shorts maybe the  high socks the open shirt and the gut black socks oh angelina is always looking hot she always has 
[05:15:30]  her makeup yeah she's always carrying the bags you just suck that's really funny that would be the  greatest publicity thing ever fantastic well anthony everyone is talking about brad pitt on prime time  live with diane sawyer did huge ratings yes absolute certainly did huge ratings so let's play a couple  of these clips really fast they're they're short ones i think it's ambitious i think it can okay this is  about uh oh you're going to preface it with some explanation as to what he says i kind of listened 
[05:16:00]  to what you said yesterday anthony i learn every day on the show and instead of just throwing this crap  out there i'm thinking maybe we should set some of this like a real show like a real show we want to  be like a real show sometimes that's our goal well just every once in a while occasionally it should  be like a real radio show brad pitt talking about ending poverty anthony what i think it's ambitious  but i think it can be done we have the potential to end poverty in our time we could be that generation  we could we could be living in that era man i mean what is more exciting than that oh um the potential 
[05:16:30]  is there we gotta go for it gotta go for it man what's more exciting than that uh angelina with her  face in a pillow and her asshole wide open that would probably take a little bit of a priority on the  excitement list two words angelina gaping wow i think you see when he entered the room that would  have been a great story when the room service came she's on her face and there's lard by the bed and 
[05:17:00]  her ass is in the air and he enters with a fistful lard can i help you her hands are tied behind her  back and her ass is up in the air i think poverty would take a back seat to that huh absolutely  he tips with lard cake hands 
[05:17:30]  give him a ten spot hold greasy lard no explanation your one shirt sleeve is rolled up  see that's proving that hollywood these guys just don't have a sense of humor because like anthony  anthony set up the uh the whole scene with the publicist you know setting up these things  there's gotta be one guy in hollywood that goes what the hell let's really throw this over the  top this uh setting setting up scenes go out and get a tub of crisco right you  you're gonna be tied to the bed face down could you whimper brad let's spread the lard on your arm 
[05:18:00]  up to the elbow  that's a good one he's just and he's got like that the lard those shirts he rolled up and the clothes  put on his nose  room service  keep this under your hat  that's classic well he wants to end poverty and poverty what a kook this guy is doesn't he make 
[05:18:30]  50 million a film one you know why does he do a movie for free and take that money and throw it at  those sons of does he think that there are eight impoverished people in the world eight that you could  just dole a few bucks out and the problem is solved does he understand how how how huge poverty is  that and it's going to be ended in this generation it could be no it won't there's been poverty for 
[05:19:00]  since there's been people and there will always be poverty that's it stop it  i just can't get the image out of my head  how brad pit  this whole lard tipping  what i tell you guys see the brad jolie thing sounded boring going into it but now  now look what you got to take home with you he's tipping with a lard hand 
[05:19:30]  lard where do you get lard it's such a great word what do i get it i live with it  well let's get back to these clips with diane's lawyer all right he wants to end poverty anthony  he's asking others to join him in a nationwide movement called the one campaign  its purpose convince americans there are solutions ways to end poverty in africa one by one  and impossibly the campaign has united hollywood liberals and christian conservatives pat robertson 
[05:20:00]  yeah it's fantastic in there yeah aren't we tired of these dividing lines that separate us what is  his common denominator common denominator something can be done in 10 years we could half extreme  poverty we could we could cut it in half in 20 years we could end it and what was it you saw that  you could do i guess shine some kind of light on this i mean i can't get out of the press these 
[05:20:30]  people can't get in the press so let's let's redirect the attention a little bit if you start  fucking some you bangy women that'll get them in the uh press yeah i'm by the way i'm tired of  those lines that divide us the guys that can fuck angelina and the guys that can't  oh they are so delusional and you don't hear about hungry people in the press you're  right you never hear about them you know we are the world never uh yeah we are the world couldn't  get the job done i don't think brad pitt can we see these fucking starving people with stupid 
[05:21:00]  baskets on their heads we get it you're hungry you want to end poverty start handing out condoms  lots and lots of condoms exactly about rewinding a little bit anthony you know the lord in the hand  answering the door freddie b makes a good point and from philly it's like the scene of fight club  when he answered the door naked with the kitchen gloves on i never saw fight club oh god fight club's a  great movie you never see fight club god i was i was always against edward norton no why because  your name no i just never i like him now i don't think he's a good actor i didn't uh american history 
[05:21:30]  acts i think he's really good i thought that was a good movie oh my god he was amazing what about  the first movie he was in that one where uh primal fear you didn't like that you don't like primal  fear not impressed i thought he was very good in that it was kind of what made him a star i know  that's why i kind of resented him i did happen i like him a lot in the uh i just didn't like the movie  i like him a lot in the uh brando film with uh robert de nero and brando the uh where they steal  yeah what's that we played the retarded guy yeah he played the retarded guy who was faking that was  that was that's another role where you kind of just playing a retard american history extra's good 
[05:22:00]  that was really good i thought that was another really really good movie although the director  one time tony k is at the comedy cellar yeah so i asked him to sign an autograph i was too embarrassed  to ask him like you know it's for my kids someday so we signed an autograph to jim's kids  oh are you kidding no what a tool i was the score ah that's what it's called  i don't mind look when artists are doing stuff to help starving people i got no problem with that  because that's not really a political agenda that's true that's fine it's like oh wait a judge 
[05:22:30]  yeah and we we really are dicks look at him trying to feed the hungry look at him i just think he's  you know delusional yeah that's all one by one there's fucking there's about 12 million of them  well yeah how about a one by one here we go diane sawyer asking brad pitt why we should listen to  celebrities the hoot who had a good idea to rid the the tootsies that might cut the problem in half  cut a few tootsies in half go over to the sedan they have some solutions solutions for having the 
[05:23:00]  problem with a machete why should we listen to celebrities i don't know that we should i'm very  uncomfortable with this i'm i'm not comfortable um even sitting here today i i'm sweating like a  pig i don't believe people should listen to me i'm hoping the images will speak for themselves  what is his uh speech impediment it's probably just a little nervous no there's something going on there  he's not a bright man every time i've heard him he's really not known to be a bright man 
[05:23:30]  every time i've heard of him speak there's something going on what is it  well like like i don't he says very very instead of very i heard him say but once when he said all  right he put his penis in angelina jolie  well like pacino can't say his r's properly sometimes he can go there's something really  he has like maybe it's something like that that's kind of it bothers you but you don't know was that  before or after the cop punched him in the mouth a little too old for my job too cranky 
[05:24:00]  all right here hold him up people are misguided anthony how's the italian food here  people are misguided yeah your google is up to now 2.7 million entries i don't even know how to  respond to that it's a strange focus isn't it that my relationships or relationship mishaps or  it takes precedent over something like that i i listen i understand it's about entertainment and 
[05:24:30]  but man it's it's misguided a bit isn't it so dramatic wait what was he talking about there  his google entries people have googled him that many times oh yeah got like huge google entry  three million google numbers he uh let's see how many googles we have can we google opie and anthony  you can't see how many you have you can't you can't google entries we have 244 000 244 000 and how 
[05:25:00]  many put in brad pitt 244 000 in the worst case of reality brad pitt has ah he has 3.3 million  let's uh all right let's go with uh oh google entries that doesn't mean google people who are looking for  you just entries that's how many uh look for uh bob kelly well let's go with jim norton first  robert kelly who broke his knee man he's got 12 million different robert kelly yeah there's a 
[05:25:30]  bunch of right come on all right let's go with rich voss there's a name not many people have rich  uh rich has 1.4 that's gotta be that's gotta be that's like every rich yeah yeah because it highlighted  the rich part yeah it takes uh all right now just voss okay now now he's got his name it's 19 900. oh  okay how about norton now you see now jim why what did you do to make it uh work like that just voss you  got to go just put quotes and then it's quotes no you just do the quotes for the whole name jim norton 
[05:26:00]  but this is a 74 200.  put in uh nathaniel nathaniel what's your last name brie bryant bryant ah look at this don and mike  14 000 of course yeah but but no but no one's listening to us shut up  up you axes nathaniel bryant has 659 entries very nice nice how many are from that his ip address 
[05:26:30]  let me just sit in it because i couldn't think of computer let me just sit in it  how many are from his ip address  good point lindy guys why is marriage ended with jennifer aniston this should be some good  good audio why did your marriage end yeah i'm going to talk about that here no oh oh oh hey 
[05:27:00]  why would you during an interview want to be revealing sorry it's only the number one question  everyone wants to know the answer to let's hear your views on hunger see diane sawyer she had any  fucking balls would say you know what i don't want to talk to you anymore you know what this is an  entertainment show and what people want to know about more than uh a curing world hunger is your  marriage and why it ended right so i'm sorry but that is the cold hard facts of life here and  these more people care about his fucking stupid marriage than world hunger and these celebrities 
[05:27:30]  just went one way i mean yeah they put the celebrity marriage out there and now it's ended so there's a  lot of uh interest in that well why did it end you know you showed us how happy you guys were over  the years and these pictures and that and what happened i don't see my time certainly my marriage  is any kind of failure this is our time mr hand an extraordinary time you quoted someone saying 
[05:28:00]  things just take different shapes and it doesn't mean the original yeah it doesn't mean you lose the  love it's just in the shape of jennifer aniston to the shape of angelina jolie reported everywhere  that you wanted babies and she did not ridiculous  a pretend cough masking an expletive what completely fabric wow what happened there  is he cursed he probably said bullshit what did he say did he say 
[05:28:30]  bullshit is he pulling an old bludo blutarsky yeah  bludo blutarsky  delta hannels yeah so yeah i cut that's he did that old bit where you cover up the swear with the  cough but he did it enough eat me they couldn't even have all of it in there so oh so that's just  them so they just have him saying bull s and then they whoops and then dianne sura cuts in let's  hear it again that's ridiculous a pretend to call off no i heard bull yeah that's got personality for 
[05:29:00]  miles that's funny and his hunger is bad well this guy's deep blow me blowjob eat me he didn't even do  it right you don't cough then say it and cough again blowjob stupid ass bullshit that's a guy who didn't  have to be funny growing up right that's exactly the guy never knew how to do that he saw funny guys 
[05:29:30]  doing it look at us haters good point why am i trying to have something he doesn't yeah a pretend  cough masking an expletive completely fabricated you know what you'll find with these stories is they  usually will will turn one of us into the good guy and one of us into the bad guy if you look at it  closely or even not that closely and uh yes it's ridiculous most of these stories you get  probably two percent real fruit juice and the rest is just garbage with no nutritional value 
[05:30:00]  all right a little analogy there he's a little high c analogy yeah  kool-aid the kool-aid analogy yeah  this next clip uh something was a brave decision what you don't know  how would you work it into a a preface for the clip though well if this was a real radio show i  would say something like i would get brad talks about a brave decision right like i don't know what 
[05:30:30]  it is but fuck it brad speaks about a brave decision he made right all right concerning  but all i got is uh i don't know he did something and it was a brave decision he did something  do you really want to have a real radio show no okay as far as i know we get one shot at this thing  one one time around and it better be everything you want it to be i mean it's up to you to make that  it and uh that's it that's it i actually think it was a really brave conscious conscientious decision 
[05:31:00]  on our part i mean we'll see splitting up that what he talked about getting a divorce yeah yeah  being brave enough to know that the relationship was over yeah that is brave and that there was  hotter tail out there yeah that needed to be explored a fistful of lard out there that is  brave though when you're brad pitt to like you know to risk not meeting a girl i know that's pretty 
[05:31:30]  brave no yeah it would be brave if it happened to jim norton yeah whatever on top of a girl it's  balls when john madden leaves a relationship it's brave yeah that is a good point yeah that's real  brave like they're not just lining up and and brad pitt could just go out and go i'm gonna see how  many girls i could fuck tonight just gonna say how many i'm gonna try to set my all-time record how  many different smells i can get on my bag right one evening yeah yeah he's such a brave brave man 
[05:32:00]  we got we are really sad in this room though just bashing him we should be though just bashing  him because he's he's good looking yeah but we're honest and he's not we're at least we expose ourselves  and embarrass ourselves and don't we have to be though i understand part of the personality that  has to outshine that has to outshine these good-looking guys i understand it we're chimps  believe me i don't know what we do is to make up for the fact that we don't have full juicy kissable 
[05:32:30]  lips it's a sure it still makes me sick though all right she and pitt working together for the first  time when you first met her what were you expecting when you read all the stuff the tattoos no blood in the  vile he won't comment but describes jolie as not what the publicity leads us to think no well i have  great respect for her she's a good egg and i've and and a great actress and i admire what she's what  she's doing admired again and work and uh so let me try some of these questions all right let's go 
[05:33:00]  personal questions which i abhor did angelina jolie break up your marriage no  are you handle this like a game show no everyone says she's a home wrecker  it's a good story but you know i've been in these tablets for 14 years now  at some point you just become the zen master of it all wow she used the oldest uh trick in media 
[05:33:30]  everyone is saying everyone is saying really diane name a few people sourceless right that is just the  way everyone is the media can put things without ever having to come up with who it was everyone  is saying everyone is saying people are saying right i didn't say it to fox news does all the time  people are saying that doesn't make it news no because people are saying but then they could report it  and it's not their opinion it's not their question people are saying everyone is saying everyone 
[05:34:00]  is brad pitt abhors personal questions understandable don't do an interview with diane sawyer  right just just don't do it what's status now that's what we're going to find out here what's  status now what's status now yeah is that the preface to that one yeah you want to guess what's  status now his relationship with one of the chicks there all right i'll go with uh  angelie jolie angelina jolie and just to make it interesting you go with jennifer aniston 
[05:34:30]  jennifer aniston no because i know they're broken up i'm going to say angelina jolie  but that's doesn't make for interesting radio because then one of us can say see i was right  and the other guy i was damn it so you go with jennifer aniston all right i'll go with uh  jennifer aniston all right and you'll go with angelina jolie jimmy uh i'm going to take uh kim  fields all right so what kind of relationship is this now are they officially together we give it 
[05:35:00]  a try there's a lot still to you know i was right it's put in place listen i don't know what the future  is just yet there's um there's still things that have to i guess be answered from here individually  you can be able to keep this up not talking not talking about it well it's not it's more that there's  not there's not so much to talk about you know at this time lord if there is i will well there's  a couple things that are going on here right uh one they're not talking because uh they're getting a  lot of great publicity out of it by not leading up to the uh the movie that's coming out what 
[05:35:30]  friday mr mrs smith and the other thing that the other point you brought up the other day there's  got to be some kind of you know divorce thing here yeah they're still pending litigation at this  time so all he could say yeah he probably can't elaborate on their relationship and how far  into what they are and when they started and what they're doing and what he's spending his  money on things like that i bet you if she was 300 pounds though and they asked him and he wasn't  whether he'd go no i'm not with her yeah she's a friend i admire her that's not fucking stop with 
[05:36:00]  the bullshit for i admire her do you really i admire her i admire brando i want to fuck angelina jolie  yeah yeah they're never honest with that hi this is jessica alba and you are listening to opian anthony  he's in the gossiping because he needs to know the buzz and giggling like a girl
