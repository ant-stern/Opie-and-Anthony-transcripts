<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a raucous review of the Grammy Awards.  Opie and Anthony, along with an unnamed co-host and several callers, dissected various performances, employing crude humor and offensive language throughout.  Lady Gaga's performance, featuring a "hula hoop dress" and a suggestive costume element, was a focal point, along with Elton John's duet with her.  Taylor Swift's performance with Stevie Nicks prompted speculation about Nicks's past drug use.  Jamie Foxx's performance, featuring his sister (described with offensive terms), and other artists, also drew criticism.  Michael Jackson's posthumous tribute and his children's appearance fueled speculation about their parentage and appearance.  The hosts played and heavily criticized audio clips from the Grammy performances, interspersed with their own commentary and jokes.  Bobo was also mentioned and mocked.  The hosts lamented their perceived lack of control over the show's content.

The discussion shifted to a broader critique of the Grammy Awards, focusing on the perceived lack of rock music and an overrepresentation of Black artists.  Harsh criticisms, including racial slurs, were leveled at several artists, including Mary J. Blige, Daughtry, and Green Day.  The hosts' negative opinions extended to Jeff Beck's performance, while Avril Lavigne received more positive comments, with one host expressing attraction to her.  This segment was unexpectedly interrupted by a news report about a small plane making an emergency landing on the New Jersey Turnpike.

The show then transitioned to listener calls and a lengthy, scathing discussion of the Jay Leno/Conan O'Brien Tonight Show controversy.  The hosts replayed clips from Leno's Oprah interview and Jimmy Kimmel's mocking segment.  They vehemently criticized Leno, calling him a "scumbag," and debated whether he should have rejected the offer to return to *The Tonight Show*, speculating on his contract and his relationship with Oprah.  A caller suggested Leno should have refused the initial offer, but the hosts countered that contractual obligations likely prevented this.  The hosts also discussed whether Conan O'Brien had similar leverage.  The segment concluded with a brief, ironic Black History Month tribute to Larry Blackmon of Cameo and further musical preference discussions, alongside a caller's humorous recounting of a negative experience during taser training.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I believe we put on a fine show every day, but let's not be mistaken, we are the dumbest  guys in radio.  Ew, it's Opie and Anthony, this place stops. 
[00:00:30]  There's no mistake about it, we are the dumbest guys in broadcasting.  Anybody that doesn't appreciate this radio show can go and kill yourself.  Kill yourself.  What will happen today?  I can't believe anyone is still listening to this show.  Oh, you want me to fuck your dick?  One girl told me my balls smell like a ham and monster on wheat.  I'm going to make the crumbs so good.  This is going to be another stupid show.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. 
[00:01:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Another fine week of radio about to begin.  I guess.  I hope.  You know what?  We said that last weekend.  Wow, we had a hell of a week of radio.  A fine week.  We should have taken today off.  Yeah, we could have just ridden our...  And patted ourselves on the back and said, you know, we had such a great week of radio, 
[00:01:30]  we're going to take Monday off.  With Bobo on Friday.  Stupid Bobo.  Kelly throwing off at his asshole.  It was just fantastic.  That stuck with me all weekend.  Did it?  Oh, it certainly did.  I actually forget about Bobo as soon as he leaves the studio.  Well, he's one of those guys, I mean, we do great radio with him and then I forget that  we even did radio with him.  I saw him at Bar 9 on Friday.  Yeah.  A lot of people were down there.  Had a good time.  But yeah, Bobo was down there. 
[00:02:00]  And he...  This is what Bobo does on those big nights out.  The place is really crowded.  Yeah.  And a lot of fans there and everything.  Good.  And Bobo walks around with his cell phone showing people pictures and he's like, this  one is by...  Be with by Fairblee.  Here's me in the studio.  And then the fans just go, oh, show him.  And make him walk to somebody else.  And they just keep doing that and just shove it off on everybody. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, that's classic.  And he never catches on.  Poor Bobo.  Fucking listeners are a bunch of dicks.  Oh, yeah.  I was going up to Bobo when he...  Because I saw him interacting with some fans.  So when I saw that happening, I would just go up to them and ask the fan that he had been  talking to if they had seen his penis.  And then I would take out my phone and start showing up.  The penis picture with his penis and horse asshole.  With the drawings around it.  And his penis as the nose was very funny.  Yeah.  You missed a fine show Friday, Jimmy. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, it was fantastic.  One for the ages.  Yeah.  Anyway.  That was a good one.  Well, happy Black History Month to our African-American listeners.  Are we doing our Black History Month day?  I sure hope so.  Well, I wanted to let everybody know on the 1st of February that this is indeed Black History Month.  Yeah.  And we usually do some kind of a tribute where we highlight and put the spotlight on lesser  known African-Americans throughout history.  So we better have one for today, right? 
[00:03:30]  We better fucking have one.  Right, Steve?  Right, Steve?  That should have just been a given.  You do?  God damn.  Oh, so you guys are doing Black History Month?  Well, fuck me all to hell.  Whose show is this?  I don't even know if it's our show anymore, Ann.  I think our names are just on it.  Thank God.  I think we're just the puppets for everybody else.  Thank God we don't really have to work.  What do you want us to do today?  What do you do for a living?  Character?  God.  Character?  Character?  Character?  I was listening to that on the replay. 
[00:04:00]  Number one on the countdown.  Diving home, number one on the countdown over the weekend.  I was listening to it and just laughing my ass off at that guy.  What a non-lawyer.  How is that guy a lawyer?  I don't know.  I don't know how he represents you.  Did you see the video?  Why don't you go fuck yourself?  What the fuck is this guy saying?  Yeah, we got to get Ron the lawyer back on the show soon.  Real soon.  Yeah.  I don't even know where to begin.  The Grammys were last night. 
[00:04:30]  And you know, I watched the Grammys for, I don't know, it was on until like 11.30.  I finally gave up around 10, 10.15, somewhere around there.  What a bore.  That's why I can't be bothered anymore.  The Grammys are really just a boring, boring display.  I can't tell you the last award show I even watched.  I don't blame you.  I don't watch the MTV Awards shows, you know, that were hip 20 years ago.  Yeah.  Now they're the same thing as the Grammys and fucking, I'll probably watch, like the Oscars,  I think is the only thing I'll peek in on to see Best Picture. 
[00:05:00]  Sure.  Or something.  And the Grammys, they had, I don't think they had a host.  They went hostless.  Now that I think about it, I don't think they had a host.  And I don't think that's smart.  I think you need a guy like a comic or a female comic, whoever you want to go with, to just  kind of, you know, riff and make some jokes.  And then he's kind of the glue for the whole show where he pops back on stage and comments  about maybe some of the stuff that is happening.  And then resets.  And then gets a line or two, resets. 
[00:05:30]  I don't know.  These people just walking out and giving out awards without a host is really, really  strange.  They really did that?  I believe so.  That's interesting.  Novel idea.  I mean, I watched the show and I don't think there was a host.  I didn't watch it so, Ken.  I watched the highlights on the news the next morning.  Yeah.  See who won.  That's all I need to know.  Who were the winners?  Was there any controversy, which will be overexposed 20,000 times on the news if there was.  No. 
[00:06:00]  So, you know.  The highlight, I guess, was Lady Gaga's extremely strange dress.  With the hula hoop dress?  The hula hoop dress.  I know.  She had a hula hoop.  She kind of looked like a solar system or something like that.  I don't know what she was going for.  The future.  But they just thought she was brilliant for doing it.  It's the future, Opie.  Remember in the olden days where they would show people how they would dress in the future?  Oh, right, right, right.  That's Lady Gaga's all over that look.  Okay.  She dresses like a space person.  She's dressing like the future.  She dresses like something out of an Ed Wood space movie. 
[00:06:30]  She's dressing like the World's Fair, 1963.  Exactly.  The future.  The future.  The kitchen of the future.  Here's Lady Gaga's clothes.  How does she sit down?  How does she pee?  How does she do anything in that jump thing?  She doesn't have to sit down to pee.  She pees through that giant penis.  Oh, that's a good point.  That sticks out of her vagina.  But she had a duet with Elton John.  Sir.  They call him Sir Elton John now.  Great.  How'd it go?  She's more of a man than he is.  That's for sure. 
[00:07:00]  It was good.  How'd it go?  Good?  Yeah, it was good.  What'd they sing?  One of Elton's classics?  It was kind of like a medley.  Oh.  I think they did her song, Speechless, and then they did Elton John, Your Song.  So, there's something about that Lady Gaga.  In what way?  Not so much just her red carpet pictures, but when she's performing, she looks very sexy.  She is sexy, man.  She does some sexy moves.  Yeah, but then red carpet, she just kind of looks like some... 
[00:07:30]  No, no.  She's not old, but she looks like some Long Island Jew woman that just bleached her hair and put on a hula hoop skirt.  Well, she was very serious on the red carpet.  That was her thing.  Was she?  That was her demeanor, where she wasn't really...  She was expressionless on the red carpet.  See, that looks cool with her 60s go-go bangs and the dark, dark eye makeup.  Yeah.  You know, that's kind of cool.  I don't find her unattractive.  She does the best with what she's got. 
[00:08:00]  You know something?  I mean, if she...  You got something there.  Here's the problem.  I mean, she's one of the hottest things in music, right?  If not the hottest thing in music, she's making a shitload of money.  If that was just a regular girl from Long Island, she would look like a pig.  Yeah, you think so?  You wouldn't even think twice.  You wouldn't even look at her twice.  You think we're just looking at her in another light because she's, you know, on stage and  scantily clad and moving around and singing.  She does the best with what she's got.  Sure.  How old is she, you think? 
[00:08:30]  She's 45, I think.  Yeah, I have no idea.  I can't tell how old Lady Gaga is.  She's young 20s.  She's going to be 18 or she's going to be 35.  I have no idea.  I would guess she's late 20s.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  Well, she used to kind of hang around NYU and...  You got a late start?  She's a New York City broad.  You know, Wikipedia, that bitch right about now.  She's from the area Jimmy hangs out in a lot.  Down near the village?  Down near the...  23.  Yeah, the comedy cell and all that.  Oh, okay. 
[00:09:00]  She played all those clubs down there.  Yeah, she's probably...  23.  Yeah.  Wow, really?  She's probably more Lower East Side, too, than the cellar.  The cellar's at the West Village.  She's probably more like the fucking Bowery.  Yeah, probably.  I mean, if you want, I can give you a taste of the Lady Gaga Elton John thing.  Let's hear it.  Let's hear what it sounds like.  Fucking Elton John, man.  You know, I'm...  Who is now?  I don't think I've ever downloaded one of Elton John's songs.  Or anything, but when you hear his shit, you're like, God damn, that guy knows what he's doing. 
[00:09:30]  Did he have any hits?  Just a couple.  Rocket Man is fucking phenomenal.  Rocket Man.  Do you know how old I feel when I'm in the car with my girlfriend and Philadelphia Freedom comes on?  I start tapping my fucking...  Philadelphia Freedom.  Because I remember when I was a kid, my dad would have said, that's a fucking great tune.  Yeah, he liked that.  I love the band.  I love the band.  I love the band.  I love the band.  I love the band.  I love the band.  I love the band.  I love the band.  This isn't one of my favorite Elton John's songs. 
[00:10:00]  I love this one.  You like this one, Jimmy.  Yeah.  But it's like, you really feel like an old man.  Yeah.  When you're just listening to that in front of your girlfriend.  You're like, I fucking am finished.  This would be true.  He's kind of like Cher, but not as masculine.  That's a tone tapper.  Is this live?  Yeah, of course. 
[00:10:30]  Travis is playing it.  Of course it's the live version.  What about Funeral for a Friend?  I know that one.  You know Funeral for a Friend.  We hear Funeral for a Friend.  No, no, no.  That's epic.  It takes about four minutes before it even...  Four?  I think it's like six to eight minutes before it even starts singing.  That's what I'm saying.  It takes forever before you actually start singing.  Yeah.  It's very artistic.  Well, this is a little taste of Lady Gaga and Elton John.  We don't have to play the whole song.  Uh-uh. 
[00:11:00]  Take the line, picture Hollywood.  The Feltation.  I want to be a star.  I can't believe what you said to me.  Last night we were alone.  I threw your hands up.  Baby, you gave up. 
[00:11:30]  You gave up.  I can't believe.  Tie up to me.  With the James Dean glossy eyes.  In your tight jeans.  With your long hair.  The cigarette stained glass.  And I know that it's complicated.  But I'm a little red eyes.  So, baby.  Raise the glass to me.  The broken hearts of all my ways to friends. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, I'll never talk again.  Oh, boy.  Let this be slain.  Let this be slain.  It's not the same line every time, though.  It sounds really good.  And I'll never long again.  Oh, boy.  You've been up to me.  It's been slain.  You've been up to me.  You've been up to me.  I don't find her very good, like, technically. 
[00:12:30]  Well, she's good when she's...  Well, here.  Let this be slain.  I hope you don't mind.  I hope you don't mind.  Yeah.  And after all the boys and girls that we've been through.  Would you give it all up?  Would you give it all up?  If I promise you, Lord, it's you.  His outfit is terrible.  Well, he's dressing like Lady Gaga. 
[00:13:00]  Was that what he was doing?  Yeah, it was Halloween night at the Grammys.  At the Grammys.  He had a dirty face.  Yeah, let's get either a chimney sweep or he just left Steve's apartment.  Sorry, Steve.  Yes.  I hope you don't mind.  I hope you don't mind.  I know what you were going to say.  I think when she slows down her voice and does ballads, it's average at best.  Yeah, yeah.  She needs to be singing that pop shit.  Yeah, she needs that fucking auto-tuning going on and all kinds of wackiness and fucking techno music behind her. 
[00:13:30]  She does a ballad and she's like, all right, yawn.  Ah, Psycho Bob's got the line that we should have had.  Psycho Bob, Baltimore, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Hey, I think Lady Gaga dresses like George Jetson's wife, Jane.  Yeah, okay.  Very good, Jane.  Punch it out.  Was it Judy?  Well, Judy was the daughter, right?  Judy was the daughter, yeah.  So maybe more like Judy Jetson.  Who was the son?  Ted Jetson.  Email that picture to me. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, well.  Taylor Swift won a lot of shit last night, Anthony.  Yeah.  And she also did a duet.  With?  Well, it just shows you that these new broads, they don't have really good voices.  I think they're products of studios.  Yeah.  We have talked about this before.  Her idol is Stevie Nicks.  So Stevie Nicks comes out and sings with Taylor Swift.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding me.  Why would you attempt to sing with Stevie Nicks? 
[00:14:30]  Not only that, but why would Stevie Nicks come out in public?  Did she?  How did she look?  You know.  I know.  Look, she's no kid.  Let's just put it this way.  It's not the 70s anymore.  She had her heyday.  Or the 80s.  Or the 90s.  The cute little impish singer from Fleetwood Mac.  Yeah.  The little fireball of energy with Fleetwood Mac.  I guess those days are gone, eh?  Yeah.  I was telling my wife last night. 
[00:15:00]  Do you remember the Stevie Nicks rumor?  Which one?  That she had a cock?  Was that one of those?  I don't know.  Every rumor about someone.  The best Stevie Nicks rumor ever.  It was going around that she loved her cocaine so much that she would be found in stalls.  I don't know why she would be found in stalls.  But this rumor was solid.  This was like Mikey Pop Rock solid.  And people would find her in the stall, bent over, as it didn't matter if it was a guy 
[00:15:30]  or a girl would be blowing cocaine up her ass with a straw.  She liked the coke up her ass?  That was a huge rumor back in, I don't know, late 80s, early 90s.  That she liked her coke so much.  And supposedly, I guess, she did so much coke.  This is all rumors, obviously.  The septum in her nose?  She fucked up her nose so bad that she fucking had to have people blow cocaine up her ass with a straw.  Blow up her ass. 
[00:16:00]  All right, let's see.  There's Stevie.  You want to hear this?  Let me just take a look at her.  All right.  It could be worse.  She's all right.  She's no kid, but she's not a complete wreck.  All right.  Well, this is great.  This exposes the young singers, the young pop stars, and really shows you that they can't  keep up with the legends.  Because they can't lip sync these.  They cannot do it.  Well, let me just play it.  And you tell me.  Give Taylor Swift a grade on this.  We won't play the whole thing. 
[00:16:30]  We got the gun.  This is a fairy tale.  And an honor to share a stage with Stevie Nicks.  The  She knows her lies like a bird in flight.  And who will be her lover? 
[00:17:00]  The harmony leaves a little to be desired there.  Her first high note was flat.  It was horrible, wasn't it?  Floating my girlfriend's ass on the boat.  And then, uh...  Stevie Nicks just walks up. 
[00:17:30]  Her voice is like fucking butter, man.  Just smooth as silk still.  And then Taylor...  Yeah.  She, uh...  Yeah.  Thin.  Very thin voice.  Well, she took the lead for that second verse.  Yep.  I couldn't tell who was who.  Come on, Jimmy.  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  Who sang first?  Just because of black history.  Stevie!  She sounded better.  She is like a cat in the dark, man.  She is the dark, man.  Taylor's doing a high harmony here.  She rules her life like a fine sky, larkin' when her sky is starless. 
[00:18:00]  All your life you never see.  Again, she can't hit that high fucking harmony.  I could never hit the high note, Alice.  Stevie did Taylor Swift a huge favor.  She has no business being on that stage with Stevie Nicks.  Wow.  Right?  Yeah.  I can't take my friend.  Would you say if she promised you ever?  I can't take my friend. 
[00:18:30]  Will you ever win?  Will you ever win?  Will you ever win?  This song is terrible anyway.  I fucking hate Fleetwood Mac.  Come on.  No.  My friend's brother plays for him, too.  Your friend's brother?  Yeah.  Mark Vito.  His brother plays guitar, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a club owner in Wildwood. 
[00:19:00]  Look, it's not...  I mean, that guy with the fucking midget banjo.  Again.  You can hear it, though.  Taylor just can't keep up with that shit.  No, no.  The regular voice.  And then you hear her with one of her produced songs and shit like that, and it's magic.  It's nothing but magic.  Magic.  I will say I'm glad that they did kind of not lip-sync.  I know.  For the most part, I don't think anyone was lip-syncing last night.  Yeah.  They kind of got off of that after the whole Milli Vanilli thing many years back. 
[00:19:30]  Did you see...  Oh, you didn't see any of the...  You didn't see Jamie Foxx and his...  No.  What did he do?  What did he do?  Well, I guess he hired Beetlejuice to perform with him, because...  Do you have the Jamie Foxx performance for Anthony?  I think he hired Beetlejuice.  Oh, no.  I, uh...  I just want to show this thing, Anthony.  I'm just not a musical Jamie Foxx fan. 
[00:20:00]  No?  And I'm not really an actor Jamie Foxx fan.  Well, it was awkward when he came out.  Oh, jeez.  Let me direct your attention to the center stage, where members of the Royal Grammophonic Society  will attempt to elevate these proceedings with the glory that is opera!  See, it's opera, eh? 
[00:20:30]  It's opera.  Yeah.  Oh, and then Jamie Foxx comes back.  Get up!  Yeah.  His big song, Blame It on the Alcohol, Anthony.  And there's the auto-tune song of the year.  Why is he singing?  Because that's what he does now. 
[00:21:00]  But you guys got to see when he brings Beetlejuice out.  Why is he dressed like General Custer?  I don't know.  Danny, just fast forward a little bit.  He brings out some friends.  Does he?  Do you think the music people in the audience are like,  All right, Jamie Foxx.  Yeah, get the fuck out of here.  No, they all just kiss each other's ass.  Is that it?  Oh, yeah.  A little further than this song.  Whoever invented the auto-tune is like the guy that invented AIDS. 
[00:21:30]  It's the fucking laugh track of music.  Thank you.  Perfect.  Oh, shit, yo.  And that's T-Pain coming out.  T-Pain.  T-Pain.  Motherfucking T-Pain.  Motherfucking T-Pain.  Jay-Z's into it.  And then he brings some more friends out.  All right. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Terrible song.  It's just horrible.  It's just an auto-tune song.  It's taking forever.  Could you fast forward?  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Jay-Z walk on stage?  No.  You don't.  This is a long way for a joke.  Holy shit, this fucking song went on forever.  Not.  And then he brings out Beetlejuice.  Who is that?  Who is that?  I can't tell. 
[00:22:30]  He's lovely.  And then Slash comes out.  What the fuck is going on here?  How big of an event do you want to make this?  Yeah.  It's a lame song.  Yeah.  Look, it's Michael Jackson's coffin.  With a yay written on it.  When Slash comes out, it does a little November rain.  Yeah.  Who's the fat fucking midget?  Well, it's just weird that he brings her out as he's singing Blame It On The Alcohol. 
[00:23:00]  I didn't know who that was.  You want to know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll write it down for you.  Look, and they're still fucking like, all right, enough of this.  I can't take it.  This is terrible.  That's his?  Oh, why was she out there?  I don't know.  Who cares that it's his?  Yeah, Jamie Foxx.  Jamie Foxx brought out his sister. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Who doesn't really...  Who the last name does not quite fit.  Nothing foxy about her?  No.  No.  No, she's related to Jamie Oxx.  God.  Oh, God.  I hate how they tried to make it such an event.  Such a monumental thing for the ages.  Like, this is going to be remembered for years to come. 
[00:24:00]  Well, because the song doesn't hold up by itself, so you have to make it an event.  So you have to get, like, T-Pain out there, and you got to get Slash doing a little November  Rain with his top hat on.  That's why.  That's why you got Pink doing an acrobat act, because she doesn't have a voice like Beyonce  or Lady Gaga.  She's in Cirque du Soleil now or something.  They had her wrapped in a sheet hanging from the fucking ceiling.  Well, when she fucking walked...  Did you see what she was wearing as she walked on the stage to do her acrobat act?  No, what?  She looked fucking completely naked. 
[00:24:30]  Did she?  Look any good?  You know what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not a hint of a boob, though.  Yeah, Pink's very kind of manly.  She's got, like, kind of a husky body on her.  She's built like a gymnast.  Yeah.  Not many gymnasts are bangable.  Or a prison bull dyke.  Interchangeable there.  And if you don't have a really good voice, you got to pump it up with something.  Yeah.  So this is, uh, pink. 
[00:25:00]  She's in some kind of a robe, I think.  All right.  With the artistic bullshit.  There's a horrible version online.  Is that a video or is it live?  Last night.  Uh, this is from last night.  Is she just wearing a ribbon under that?  Is that pretty much what it is?  She's going to rip this off in a second.  Well, then just slide that fucker forward until she rips it off.  I can't watch this whole bullshit video.  You don't think this is good?  Well, there you go.  I'd say, okay.  Wait, go back.  Go back a little.  As she's walking.  She rips. 
[00:25:30]  Right when she rips that fucker off.  Yeah, watch this.  Here we go.  All right.  She has no tits.  What a fucking body on her, man.  Yeah, but she has no tits.  I don't care.  She has legs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you're dressed like a gymnast, you got to have some boobs, I'm thinking.  She's got an ass that makes up for it right there.  And then she goes up in a sheet.  Yeah, and then she spins around.  Look at the ass on her.  Yeah, even through the sheet, it looked pretty good.  Until that big brown wet spot leaked through.  Until she sharted right through it. 
[00:26:00]  And it's fucking drooling out like the alien's mouth when he's about to bite Sigourney's face.  Then they pour water on her.  Oh, great.  Whatever.  That's the fantastic moment in Grammy history.  Let's say hi to Steve in Vegas.  Steve.  Yes.  It's Monday.  I couldn't make it in.  I was gambling with my health again.  I'm the bareback producer.  Yes.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hello, Steve.  Hi, Steve.  I just want to say, as you saw, the death reel where they gave Michael Jackson the big 
[00:26:30]  standing ovation and the other 50 people that died, they just kind of threw to the wayside.  Well, we've talked about this.  Some people's deaths are more important to us than others.  Yeah.  Oh, that's pink without a fucking shirt on?  Is that real?  Yes, it's all real.  Everything on the internet is real.  She's got some boobies.  Yeah, it's something.  What's that, boys?  Wait, wait.  Who died last year?  Might have strapped them down.  Besides Michael Jackson.  Who was, like, number two on the list? 
[00:27:00]  DJ AM.  Oh, that's a big drop-off, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, kind of a drop-off there.  No disrespect, but that's a big drop-off.  Les Paul.  Les Paul's a biggie.  Yes, Les Paul.  I don't know.  Billy Mays.  Michael Jackson's kids.  You want to continue with this Grammy talk?  It's so fascinating.  We might as well.  Michael Jackson's kids.  Did they bring out the little kid that was afraid?  Blanket?  Little Blanket.  Did Little Blanket come out?  Funny you ask, because I think we're onto something with Blanket is, what is our, afraid? 
[00:27:30]  Did we use or scared?  He's just scared.  Blanket is scared of the light?  Blanket.  What was our line?  Blanket is scared of the light?  He is.  He wasn't, uh, hates the light.  Blanket hates the light.  Blanket hates the light.  Blanket was not at the Grammys, but the other two were there.  Yeah.  So Blanket, he's done.  He's done with the light.  He's back.  That's it?  He's back in his cave.  Or Little Blanket.  Or the cellar, wherever they allow him to live his life.  Blanket.  What a legacy Michael Jackson has. 
[00:28:00]  Pedophilia and naming a child after something you cover yourself with.  There's just two fucking white kids on stage.  It's really weird.  And no one, no one, yeah, it's unmentionable.  Those are Michael Jackson's children.  Lovely white children.  And will Debbie Rowe just admit that she fucking gave her eggs for these kids?  The daughter looks exactly like her in the eyes.  The daughter looks like Sarah Palin.  Really?  Well, with the glasses. 
[00:28:30]  And the son looks like Damien in the second omen?  Yes.  No hint of African blood in there whatsoever.  Michael Jackson was just self-hating.  Yes.  He was a self-hating guy.  He did not want to have to look at a little Negro child being as his.  So he got little white children somehow through eggs and sperm donation and raised them as his own kids.  And, I mean, give me a break.  People actually bought into this for a while, too. 
[00:29:00]  When he had them going to the airport with the mask sign, yet you could see their straight hair, their fucking white faces, and people were like, there's the Jackson children.  There's Michael's kids.  And no one brought up the fact that they're white.  And a lot of people are going to go, well, Angelina and Brad adopt black kids and sperm, which is funny.  He never fessed up to adopting anything.  People said he fathered these children.  He didn't.  He did not father those kids.  It's impossible, right?  Well, you want to hear the son there talk? 
[00:29:30]  I like the daughter wearing the fucking, what's she got on with the frills on the front?  The Austin Powers shirt.  She's wearing an Austin Powers shirt.  And they gave Michael Jackson a Grammy for...  What?  What?  What did they do?  They just kind of make up Grammys for people.  That?  They really do.  I don't even know what he got.  The worst commercial for Propofol award?  Michael Jackson's kids.  Thank you. 
[00:30:00]  Thank you.  We are proud to be here to accept this award on behalf of our father, Michael Jackson.  First of all, we'd like to thank God for watching over us for these past seven months.  And our grandma and grandpa for their love and support.  What was this for them?  We would also like to thank the fans.  Our father loved you so much because you were always there for him.  Our father was always concerned about the planet and humanity.  Through all his hard work and dedication, he has helped through many charities and donated to all of them. 
[00:30:30]  Through all his songs, his message was simple.  Love.  Yeah.  We will continue to spread his message and help the world.  Thank you.  We love you.  We love you.  And now power.  We're going.  Daddy was supposed to be here.  Daddy was going to perform this year.  Oh, he was?  But he couldn't perform last year. 
[00:31:00]  Thank you.  We love you, Daddy.  He's got mental problems.  I think I'd say in my professional diagnosis of one half a minute of talking that they have mental problems.  That's what I'm going to say.  Why?  Because you have to reaffirm the relationship every eight seconds.  My father, Daddy, our father.  My father, Daddy, Father, Pop.  Yes.  Old man, Pop, Father.  Oh, God damn.  Giver of life. 
[00:31:30]  I like how she almost said why her father couldn't be here this year.  I think we know.  Yes, he was supposed to.  His jaw's dropping in a box somewhere.  He's singing the old eternal note.  He's looking at the man in the satin.  Holy shit, enough already with the fucking worship of this guy.  Asshole Hollywood.  Stop.  Well, they did one of Michael Jackson's songs last night. 
[00:32:00]  Did they?  Who did?  I don't know.  It was an all-star lineup.  Lady Gaga?  Nah, she wouldn't be fucking caught dead doing that shit.  Really?  It was like Celine Dion and Usher and...  Oh, wow.  And that...  What the fuck is her name?  Jennifer Hudson?  Oh, yeah.  She's got a sick, powerful fucking voice.  Well, she does.  She really does.  She's a diva.  She's got that diva thing going on.  She lost a little weight.  She's looking good.  Stop it.  She's looking good.  Stop it.  Stop it. 
[00:32:30]  There's no fucking way she could look good.  And they were trying to do a 3D thing, because, you know, Avatar's all the rage.  Are you kidding me?  What'd they do?  And all of a sudden, on the screen last night, it said, put your glasses on.  And I'm looking around my house.  I'm like, I don't have glasses.  It's like, I got LASIK.  I don't have glasses.  No, the 3D glasses.  That's what I'm talking about.  Can they do that?  Where were you supposed to get the glasses from?  Can they LASIK your eyes so you can just see 3D?  So, they go, put your glasses on.  I'm like, what the fuck?  I'm like, I don't have fucking 3D glasses. 
[00:33:00]  So, if you don't have the 3D glasses, which I would imagine most of America did not, you  saw this greeny, greeny fucking mess on the screen.  Were they trying hard to make it 3D, like reaching out?  I didn't have the glasses.  I don't know.  I don't know what you were supposed to see.  How were you supposed to see it?  They didn't tell people to get glasses.  I think they did tell people to get glasses.  But where were you supposed to get the glasses?  At your local stop and shop.  That's what it looked like.  I don't know.  Thank you.  Oh, yeah.  I know where...  The reds and blues are separated.  Yeah, just old school.  It was really, really hard to follow if you didn't have the glasses. 
[00:33:30]  That's old school.  Wow, they got shitty versions of all these songs online.  Oh, see, look.  Now they're blowing out like a dandelion, so all those will probably all scatter around  you.  And then in the culmination, Michael's cock sprays 3D jism all over the children.  It's wonderful.  Oh, it's good.  And then they have a bottom of the grave view of his coffin going down, and it looks like 
[00:34:00]  it's actually coming down on top of you.  Yeah.  Who's this?  Who is this?  Celine Dion.  Get the kayak.  Yeah, good old Celine Dion.  Oh, look at that.  Stupid fucking iron face.  Oh, I think I saw Michael in the background.  Oh, was it a monkey?  No.  Sorry.  It was the...  What is that?  The strong bird.  Can we hear the...  Let's hear how they say it.  It's a shitty version.  With the black armband, like some fucking, I don't know, a soldier died or a cop. 
[00:34:30]  Out of here.  Who would let their kid be in a Michael Jackson video still?  There were people that let Michael fuck their kids for money.  Notice my hand went up.  Allegedly.  Stop it.  Allegedly.  Who's going to sue me?  Sue me.  Let me go to Jimmy James.  Jimmy James.  Hey, boy.  Good boy.  Good morning, Jimmy James.  Devil's advocate this morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, on the...  It could be Michael's kids with the genetic engineering they got, but I just picture it 
[00:35:00]  as two columns for, you know, hair white, skin tone white, all the way down except for  weight and voice.  You know what?  Uh, no, these kids don't have any genetic markers of Michael Jackson in them whatsoever.  You know what?  I would have...  She's going to be hot, I bet.  Boys, can I throw myself in the pocket?  I know.  She's going to end up like her mom, Debbie Rowe, though, man.  No, maybe she'll have better eating habits than fat.  What, Jimmy James?  You just keep talking, Jimmy James. 
[00:35:30]  We had a thought.  We wanted to go with our thoughts.  And you're...  I don't know.  He just keeps talking, though.  And then your thought had nothing.  No, I'm just going to talk over him.  Thank you, James, of the Jimmy variety.  You know what?  I would have gave Michael's kids a mic and go, all right, prove you're fucking Michael  Jackson's kids.  Yeah, go ahead.  Sing something.  Yeah, that ain't going to work.  By your age, you already had 20 hits.  He did.  What do you got?  What do you got?  One of them will try to put out a song.  Michael Jackson's son or daughter or whatever it is.  My...  It's called My Daddy Pop Father Daddy. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, Daddy, we miss you.  At least I'm awful.  Oh, yeah, retrospective on his thing.  Melancholy drip.  Oh, and yes, when you taught me the ABCs, they were easy as one, two, three.  Oh, God.  The land in my world is long.  You saw the world in the mirror.  Yes.  Yes.  It was all about fucking the kids and...  Shut up.  No one cared if you were black or white. 
[00:36:30]  Daddy.  Daddy.  Daddy.  Daddy.  Daddy.  Daddy.  Father.  Pop.  Guy who's come is nowhere near us.  Well.  Well, you know.  We have none of your DNA in us.  It's not pre-birth anyway.  And then, I don't know.  I mean...  Fat mama.  Debbie Rowe moonwalks in or they skateboard her in like Jabba the Hutt. 
[00:37:00]  She's eating, sipping cocoa out of a fucking colostomy bag.  She's eating frogs out of a big bowl next to her.  Like popcorn.  Ah, whatever.  And then, I don't know.  Trying to make something out of this Grammy thing from last night.  Quentin Tarantino came on stage.  Now, what did he have to do with the Grammys?  Not much, but he was...  He sounded like he was talking black.  There's another guy I'm diagnosing as insane.  Quentin.  Just based on my own opinion of him talking in public. 
[00:37:30]  Especially of late.  Why the fuck does...  He comes in for that other movie, but he doesn't come in for Inglourious Bastards?  Uh, yeah, I don't think he...  I don't understand what happens with these guys.  They only need us when...  What?  They have a shitty movie coming out?  Although, I like that project with Rodriguez and all that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I was thinking of the other day.  I'm like, why didn't he come in for Inglourious Bastards?  What was the movie he put out before the last one? 
[00:38:00]  Like, I think a lot of time passed by is why.  You know?  He loved us.  He invited us to go watch movies if we're ever known.  He loved us.  Remember?  Oh, to stay in the night.  Remember?  We got another fake invite from a Hollywood star.  Yeah, yeah, to come sit in that theater.  He goes, man...  I saw that work.  I had to build one of my own.  He goes, yeah, next time you're in L.A., come by and, you know, I do movie night every  Monday.  Do ya?  And then we're sitting here like, well, what does that mean?  Yeah.  We're supposed to start knocking on doors when we go to Hollywood?  Yeah.  And Roland, where's my two copies of Lost? 
[00:38:30]  I want my two weeks of Lost.  What time does it start, by the way, on Tuesday?  Eight o'clock?  Tomorrow at, I don't know, but I'll be in front of the TV the second I get home from  work so I don't miss it.  Is it a three-hour special?  It's an 18-hour special.  I think it's three hours.  What?  Three hours, and I'm betting the first hour is a retrospective.  They usually do that.  They have to with that stupid show.  So I've never seen an episode.  Maybe I'm in.  Oh, yeah.  No, I've got to be the last person.  That'll fill in. 
[00:39:00]  Last person to not see Lost.  It's a good show, man.  It really is.  It's a lot of a Lost party.  Greg in D.C.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Chip Jefferson, former Kung Fu star.  Can't.  Has anyone forgotten Chip Jefferson?  We were all talking about other stuff.  What?  Well, I apologize.  I just want to add to Jimmy's song.  You should have not screwed Macaulay Culkin and just beat it.  So thanks for putting me on so far after the song.  It still kind of works, Greg. 
[00:39:30]  It still works.  Good morning.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Hey, why are you saying fuck me?  What did he say?  I don't know.  I don't think he said fuck you.  Oh, I don't know what he said.  See, I thought it was Kill Bill was the movie before that, volume two, which was 2004.  Grindhouse was 2007.  So it was a few years in between.  Well, he did run a fest.  I thought it was 7, 8, 9, 10.  I think he might have came by when we weren't around.  He came by late.  He came in at 11.  Well, that's good to know.  So maybe he was going to do our show.  Sam, Quentin Tarantino would have done our show? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, he was here.  He was in New York.  He got in the afternoon and then he was here the next morning.  But that next morning.  No.  He came in at 10.31 and we were already in the elevator.  He did stern the next morning.  But you guys took that day off.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  We did.  So you guys weren't here the morning that he was.  So it's our fault.  It is.  Fuck, he might have gave us a number this time for movie night.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that was going to happen.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, we got the police officer.  He said he'd call us back after he got tased. 
[00:40:30]  He was going through tase training, whatever.  Of course.  Taser training.  We could do that after the break.  So Quentin sounded black last night, huh?  Oh, no.  What was he doing?  He was introing Drake, Eminem, and Lil Wayne doing their song.  And he fell into character, I guess.  What was the highlight for you for the Grammys?  Well, the Beyonce performance was sick.  No, it wasn't.  The Lady Gaga performance was sick.  Fag. 
[00:41:00]  Fag.  Fag in what way?  Ridiculous.  Awesome.  Like off the charts, yo?  Off the chain.  Oh, it's off the chain now?  Of course.  Off the charts.  Did Quentin introduce them the way he introduced Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction?  No.  So you liked the Grammys, Sam?  Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about with this boring...  It was kind of boring.  It wasn't boring at all.  I thought so.  The Taylor Swift thing was good. 
[00:41:30]  It sucked.  With Stevie Nicks?  She proved that she can't sing.  It sucked, man.  She really proved she can't sing.  And Stevie Nicks, you know, she's an older broad.  And it was effortless for her.  She went into her single.  I know.  She sounded great.  Which was embarrassing that Stevie Nicks had to sing a Taylor Swift song.  With those simple, these lyrics don't mean shit.  People who listen to Taylor Swift don't even know who Stevie Nicks is at this point.  That is true.  I understand that.  People under 20 don't know who she is.  Rumors is one of the biggest albums of all time.  Look it up.  What's a big song, Rumors? 
[00:42:00]  Everything.  But like, what are a couple of them?  I mean, I've heard them all.  Don't Stop.  How's that go?  Through.  Thinking About Tomorrow.  Don't Stop.  That was Bill Clinton's big election song.  Yeah, it's all right.  Every song on Rumors is big.  I haven't thought of Rumors in a while, so now I've got to get a song list.  But every fucking song.  I just never liked Fleetwood Mac.  Secondhand News, of course.  Dreams.  But how do they go?  Don't Stop.  Go Your Own Way.  Go Your Own Way.  Go Your Own Way.  Oh, yeah.  You make loving fun.  Gold Dust Woman? 
[00:42:30]  Come on.  What's Gold Dust Woman?  Oh, wait.  This can't be all from Rumors, is it?  No, this has to be like a greatest hits.  That's not on Rumors.  Which one is Rumors?  Is that Rumors, probably?  Of course.  Yeah, that's got to be it.  Dreams.  Don't Stop.  Go Your Own Way.  You make loving fun.  Gold Dust Woman.  Those were all massive hits.  Where's Tusk?  What is Gold Dust Woman?  I don't know that song at all.  You know these songs, Jimmy.  You have to know Gold Dust Woman. 
[00:43:00]  Well, that's a hint for fucking Twink Fingers.  I'm sure he's looking for it.  You want to hear Gold Dust Woman?  Yeah, I don't know what it's called.  Oh, yeah, okay.  I wouldn't have known it by name.  They just know it.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  They know.  I never heard this.  Come on, Jimmy.  I need more Cowbell.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  It's like she's singing with a vibrator on her throat.  Did you like Pink's performance?  Pink's performance was the same thing she did on MTV.  I'm tired of seeing Pink on the ceiling.  Oh, damn.  Oh, shit.  She's done the naked suit and hanging off the ceiling before.  Yeah?  I've seen it.  So you're with us.  The Grammy sucked.  No, just Pink's thing was. 
[00:44:00]  Why did Lady Gaga have to wear, like, barbed wire?  Because she's a performance artist.  That's her thing.  Yeah.  Is she a performance artist?  She's a performance artist.  Yeah.  And by the way, she doesn't.  She can sing ballads.  I also disagree with that statement you made.  Not when you put her up against Elton John.  That was the biggest problem last night is putting these young people with the legends.  Elton John was effortless.  To the stuff she's done semi-unplugged where she's just got a piano in her voice and a little  synthesizer or something, but no effects. 
[00:44:30]  She sounds awesome.  Terrific.  Terrific.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you liked all that, like, hip-hop and stuff?  Yeah, except they bleeped out almost three-quarters of Lil Wayne's performance.  Oh, God.  Did you like Jamie Foxx's song?  That song I can't firmly get behind.  You are.  What's wrong with you, Sam?  Come on.  Just say it sucked.  I mean, it wasn't.  But auto-tune is like a trend right now. 
[00:45:00]  You know, I'm not a big auto-tune fan, but I understand it.  How do you understand it?  It's just what people like that effectiveness.  And how is it a trend when it's been around since Cher did that fucking song?  But now it's...  Believe in my own world.  I believe in my own world.  I believe in my own world.  I believe in my own world.  What was wrong with her?  I don't know.  I think she Botoxed her tongue or something.  I know.  She couldn't even talk.  Can you give me a little Cher?  A little stroke Cher.  Give me Botox Cher.  What was the name? 
[00:45:30]  The song was Believe, I guess.  Believe.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This was...  But technically, I think this was the first auto-tune song.  I did like Jamie Foxx's performance, because at the end, he said, sorry about the auto-tune,  Jay-Z, which is just a little shot in there.  Like, yeah, I'm still going to do my thing, Jay.  Aw, shit, yo.  Why?  Jay-Z doesn't like auto-tune?  He pronounced the death of auto-tune.  I see a fucking war between those two shaping up.  Jay-Z will probably let it slide.  A la fucking...  No, no.  I see like a Tupac fucking Biggie war going on between these two. 
[00:46:00]  Aw, shit.  Jamie Foxx big as a little scary.  Jay-Z is a multi-millionaire.  The two millionaires are going to...  Pushing for a billionaire.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah.  All right, sure.  That's going to happen.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're going to go at it.  Dang.  Jamie Foxx is a hack when it comes to fucking this music shit.  But he's been doing it for a while.  Like, he didn't just start doing the music after the Ray Charlesman.  He's got, what, two hits now, right?  Yeah, I mean, two mainstream.  All right, you want to hear some Cher?  Dude, this song's horrendous.  Are we going...  Go with Travis.  So we got a nice version of it. 
[00:46:30]  I love it.  You're going to be the longer one.  Oh, oh.  Listen to Botox song.  Do you believe in life after love?  Dude.  I can feel something inside me say.  I really don't think you're strong enough, no.  Do you believe in life after love?  I like Anthony's version better.  Oh, this is fantastic.  This is the gayest song ever made. 
[00:47:00]  This is a very gayest song.  You're listening to this for pleasure.  You want to play gayest song ever?  You're talking anal nitrate poppers and fucking just no lubrication asshole sex.  Oh, here's the auto-tune part.  There's the auto-tune.  There it is.  And what year was this?  I don't know.  This is at least 10 years old.  This is fucking old shit, yo.  Absolutely.  97, maybe?  I would guess 10 years old.  He's a pioneer, that woman.  I guess. 
[00:47:30]  But T-Pain popularized the auto-tune.  Did he?  He did.  Everyone knew it from this song.  Come on.  Stop it.  Nobody listening to T-Pain is listening to this song.  If you say...  This is a massive hit for Cher.  This is 1998.  Everyone commented on like, what is that thing, that voice thing?  Yeah, but it took 10 years for somebody to popularize it the way T-Pain has done.  So, how did he popularize it?  He's the one who brought it into R&B and hip-hop.  Like, what's someone saying that a black man ripped off something musical from a white woman? 
[00:48:00]  I didn't say he ripped it off.  Well, it's about fucking time the black guy gets the white guy back.  Jesus Christ, the times they aren't changing.  Holy shit, did we rip off the black man in music?  That's true.  I think we can all acknowledge that at least.  Damn.  No, black people stole blues from white people.  Exactly.  Yes.  They wouldn't have had the blues if it wasn't for us.  Yeah, that's true.  We were their mutes.  Lemons and lemonade.  That's what I'm making.  We whipped the blues right into them.  Mint julep.  See, something good came out of that hole. 
[00:48:30]  Okay.  Well, thank goodness for that.  Zoinks.  On this, the first day of Black History Month.  That's right.  And Slash doing the November rain thing was cool.  What was cool about it?  Yeah, why was it cool?  Because he hasn't done it in a while.  The big hat.  Oh, yeah, it was so original.  He came out with his hat.  Sorry there.  See, look it.  Gaga did Poker Face.  She's dancing around.  Then all of a sudden, she falls into a factory.  And out comes Gaga and Elton John.  It's great. 
[00:49:00]  It's good stuff.  Oh, my God.  That was the way they opened.  That was Michael Jackson's kid.  Boy, look at him.  It's not the spitting image of anyone but Michael.  It was John Edwards' kid.  Just blankly staring, too, by the way.  Not an emotion in that kid's face.  What else did you like about the Grammy, Sam?  Well, I thought Taylor Swift winning Album of the Year was a nice moment.  She's a hot piece of bass, though, man.  It's too bad.  Now she's got to go into her drug phase.  Yeah, she's pretty much done now with the wholesome image.  Cutesy. 
[00:49:30]  I'm singing my hit song on my bed in my room type thing.  Now she's got to go drugs like the rest of them.  Not necessarily because she's going to be the only one that doesn't do the drugs.  She's a country star before she's a pop star.  She's a crossover.  She's a crossover star.  But she's still not doing pure pop songs.  She's still doing the country songs.  Doesn't matter.  A lot of girls got in trouble.  Some young country stars got in a little bit of trouble with the drugs.  When does she shave her head?  When does Taylor Swift shave her head and start taking an umbrella and attacking people? 
[00:50:00]  I think Taylor Swift has a good head on her shoulders.  Oh, please.  They said that about Britney.  They said that about all of them.  Yeah, that would be nice.  Christina Aguilera is happily married with a child.  Yeah, but she went through a dirty stage.  Let's not forget.  Yes, she did.  She got really down and dirty for a while.  That Taylor Swift is doomed.  Oh, my God.  Doomed, I say.  Holy shit, whose ass was that?  That's Christina Aguilera.  And Danny, just the genius Danny is, just puts in Christina Aguilera's ass. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  And we get a picture of her apparently in a pool pulling her thong down.  How bad would it suck that they didn't realize until after the shoot that she didn't have her ass cleaned properly?  Who gives a shit?  I would bottle that water and sell it.  I would bottle that pool water and sell it.  Man, she's got a nice ass.  Huh?  Look how wet it is a little.  So it's slick.  So when you hit it, it would really smack.  Leave a handprint.  Nice tight one, too. 
[00:51:00]  She'd really yelp while you put it in her butt.  Oh, would she ever.  Like a small dog that you kick.  That's what I like when I'm fucking a girl in the ass.  I want her to sound like a Sharpay who's got his foot caught in the door.  Let's say hi to Mike at Ron Concoma.  Mike.  Ron Concoma.  Owen, hey, what up?  Hey, buddy.  What's up, man?  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hello.  Hey, I'm flipping through the channels last night.  E-Network.  Jamie Foxx gets on with Seacrest.  He's got two young.  All of a sudden, these young girls start coming up, and this little fat waterhead comes up. 
[00:51:30]  He's got a waterhead.  I think that's his sister, first of all.  And we already kind of commented on that.  But, I mean, Jamie Foxx makes it way too easy for comedians and shock jocks.  He has a song called Blame It on the Alcohol, and he brings out, I think, his sister that might have had a bit of a problem.  See, I didn't know that.  I didn't know there might be a bit of a problem.  You didn't notice that?  I couldn't see her.  I couldn't see shit.  So that whole time when I was trying to set you guys up for the big...  I had no clue.  Dude, she was shot from 50 yards away.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, made sense to me.  She's just like, me, me, me, me.  She couldn't speak.  Let's see a picture, Danny.  On the red carpet, Ryan Seacrest is doing the right thing, and he's talking to Jamie Foxx.  I think his 16-year-old daughter was on the red carpet with Jamie Foxx, then went to this thing.  The sister.  And she started talking, and Ryan Seacrest realized that she might have an issue and quickly took the mic away from her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Ryan Seacrest is a pro.  She looks kind of normal.  Is he?  Watch out, man.  Watch out later.  I mean, no, she's... 
[00:52:30]  She looks like anybody you'd see on the street.  There's something going on.  Yeah?  And, you know, to bring her out as you're singing, blame it on the offer.  She does reportedly have certain learning disabilities or difficulties.  Well, then who are we to goof on that?  That's right.  It's wrong.  Especially this month.  Exactly.  That's right.  We'll wait till March.  No pulse bar.  And Jay-Z won.  So that's always a good night for me.  For what?  Where did he win?  What song?  Him, Rihanna, and Kanye West won. 
[00:53:00]  For what?  Was it at least an original song?  Or were they remixing someone else's stuff?  It was an original song.  All the songs he did as are original.  Yeah, what was sampled in that song of his?  I don't believe anything was sampled in the song he did with Kanye West and Rihanna.  It was a great song.  And it deserved to win.  Are you a Fergie fan?  I am.  A huge Fergie fan.  You see how Fergie's pretty fucking hot.  Yes, she is.  She's pretty fucking hot.  And her solo album is good.  Is this?  Yes, it is.  I'll never know.  Did you hear the What's Your Name? 
[00:53:30]  Really blasted her band, Mary J. Blige, in front of, they said it was Hollywood royalty.  Like she fucking was doing some rehearsal, some party, and her band wasn't doing well,  and she just really blasted them and humiliated them.  Did she think she was Paul Anka?  No surprise.  She seems like she has a bit of a tune.  I think she said, can we get the music right for Mary J. Blige?  Are we still in rehearsal?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Talking about herself in third person.  True.  She's Mary.  She's a queen.  Wow.  Didn't she do Bridge Over Troubled Water?  I think I was listening to that as I was falling asleep. 
[00:54:00]  With one of those blind guys that have a really good voice.  They're all the same to me.  There's a few of them.  Huh?  What's his name?  Bichelli or something?  Bichelli.  Was it Pacito Domingo?  I think he can see.  I don't know.  There's a few of them that are blind but have, like, fucking voices like songbirds.  You want to hear Bridge Over Troubled Water?  I'll hear a little of that to see if she would...  We could wrap up our Grammy talk with this. 
[00:54:30]  I don't like the idea that your idea of seeing a great singer has a voice like a songbird.  A songbird.  That would suck.  You're singing a song...  That's what they always say.  A voice of a songbird.  Birds suck at singing.  They're terrible.  They're horrendous.  They're good at shitting on your new winter coat.  I got the...  Oh, fuck.  I got the horns fucking thing.  The what?  That bird.  That fucking...  Oh, God.  That thing is annoying. 
[00:55:00]  That fucking...  I'd rather listen to that than half of what the fuck was on the Grammy.  What happened, like...  I don't know.  I understand, you know, BET's got their awards and shit like that.  And MTV kind of got into the whole rap...  A lot of rap artists, when their awards started going with, like, when they had Yo MTV Raps  on years ago and stuff.  The Grammys seem to have been the benchmark of the white performer.  But now, it is completely black now, right?  No, they had Green Day perform. 
[00:55:30]  Kings of Leon were there.  I think they won something.  So, Green Day...  But what...  Other than...  How about some fucking, like, rock bands?  And I'm not talking emo fucking little...  Kings of Leon.  Baby-ass douchebag.  Bon Jovi performed.  I think there's...  Well, what rock Bon Jovi?  All right.  There's a...  He's a fucking, like, legend now.  He's a legend.  You had Bon Jovi...  Green Day...  Green Day...  ...and Kings of Leon.  All right, great.  Who else is there?  That was it.  And then everything else is...  Rock is dead, basically.  Heck no shit. 
[00:56:00]  Rock is dead.  With, like, the likes of Lady Gaga and fucking...  That bullshit.  You got techno crap.  And they have to dress like they're from fucking Venus in order to even get on the goddamn show.  She's a performance artist, but her music speaks for herself.  Shut it.  Shut it.  And then everything else is 18,000 black guys on the stage going,  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  Oh, yeah!  And the stage's got to be filled with black guys.  This is what people are listening to, right?  Nobody's listening to rock music anymore.  Nobody...  Daughtry?  I'm not saying people should listen to rock music. 
[00:56:30]  It's Daughtry.  Every song sounds the same with Daughtry.  I'm so sick of Daughtry.  I agree with Sam.  You know, Daughtry...  You know, dig a little deeper and try to find some fucking new talent out there.  Don't go with it.  Green Day?  How long has fucking Green Day been around?  Again.  American Idiot is going to Broadway.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  They performed with the Broadway cast.  They performed with the Broadway cast.  Christ on a pony, you're kidding me.  That's your white people music.  There's your punks.  Wow, they're punks.  And they still try to, like, force Green Day down our throats like they're a punk band. 
[00:57:00]  Like they're a punk band?  They're now doing a Broadway musical.  They're the farthest from punk.  Oh.  They were barely punk.  God.  They were punk for two minutes?  But they've been mainstream since...  They're so mainstream.  But they've been mainstream since 1996.  They can't pretend they're punks.  They've got Broadway now.  And his nose has been clogged since 1996.  Broadway.  Broadway.  Broadway.  Broadway.  Broadway.  Broadway.  Broadway.  Broadway.  Broadway.  Broadway.  I think they're doing an original Broadway show, though, not... 
[00:57:30]  Oh, they're not doing a...  Wedding Eye Story.  They're not doing a side story?  I don't think so.  How about this?  Hair long as I can grow it by hair.  No, not hair.  They're not doing hair either?  I don't think so.  It's Green Day musical without Green Day.  I think that's what's happening.  They're casting...  They're casting other guys to play the Green Day parts.  And other guys to play Green Day.  Oh, that's a great cast.  They've got to have Broadway voices to sing it.  That's going to work.  Yeah, yeah.  That's going to be a disaster.  I will check it out.  How is that going to ever work?  Broadway, Green Day.  You get to see Green Day on Broadway, but not Green Day. 
[00:58:00]  It's not Green Day.  They're going to recast Green Day.  Because American Idiot was a concept album, so you're telling the story.  What was the concept?  I don't know.  I didn't get the album.  Where are they from?  Green Day?  They're from...  I forget.  Are they from America?  We used to date them all the time.  And then they got too big and then blew us off.  Another band that blew us off after they got famous.  They're pretty big now.  They used to come in all the time.  They got things to do.  They're world famous.  They did a good version of Working Class Hero.  Nice... 
[00:58:30]  A good cover of Lennon.  Yeah, actually, that's pretty good.  I'm just...  You don't get the Green Day, Ant?  No, no.  I got the Green Day.  This is your great white hope.  Now, it's just like these guys are...  All right.  You know what, though?  I'm not going to bash them because they have longevity.  Yeah.  From a band that came out during a certain time, had a certain sound.  Yeah.  That was that time.  And for some reason, they're still selling fucking albums.  Absolutely.  So who am I?  Who am I?  To say they suck.  So fuck that.  But...  I'm not saying they suck, but you can't push them as a punk band. 
[00:59:00]  No.  Stop.  Or alternative rock.  No, no, no.  There's nothing alternative about them.  They're mainstream.  They're pop now.  It's fine, though.  Alternative rock is the stupidest term ever.  Yeah, of course.  I mean, now it's...  It's so ridiculously stupid.  Alternative to what?  So that's our white people.  And what?  Nickelback?  There's no good white bands.  I'm going to defend Daughtry a little bit.  Why?  Play a Daughtry song.  I don't know.  I've heard him, and I remember not thinking he was very good.  This is all I want to say about Daughtry.  He has an amazing voice. 
[00:59:30]  But he's gone with this mainstream pop stuff, when he should be doing a little edgier fucking rock.  He's shaking his money maker.  He's just making money.  But the problem is, he's smart enough to know that if you're an edgy rock band, you don't  make as much as being kind of in the pop genre.  Right.  And that's frustrating to me, because I think the guy has an amazing voice.  You had to play the faggiest song, didn't you?  Yeah, yeah.  He got you.  It's E-Rock.  This is the montage scene from fucking 90210.  Yeah. 
[01:00:00]  He hasn't done anything good since he covered Johnny Cash on American Idol.  He does have a good voice.  He's sounding less like the lead singer from Live, which was, you know.  Oh, yeah.  He was really...  Right.  Now, he's got his own fucking thing going on.  Hey, Anthony, a plane just landed on the New Jersey Turnpike.  You think that's going to cause some delays today?  That could tie up traffic for a little while when a plane lands on the Jersey Turnpike.  This is what I don't understand. 
[01:00:30]  It's a little, what, prop plane?  It looks like a two-seater.  Yeah.  A little Cessna.  It just made an emergency landing on the New Jersey Turnpike.  Excuse me.  This is breaking news.  Now, this is what I don't understand, Ant.  All right.  The plane has landed.  Everyone's safe.  Get the fucking plane off the road.  That plane will sit on that highway now all day.  Yeah.  Yeah, they've got to do an investigation.  The FAA's got to show up.  Get the fucking plane off the highway.  And planes take up a lot of room with their stupid wings.  Okay.  Like, you can land in one lane, but you're taking up all the lanes with your wings. 
[01:01:00]  I think that might cause a problem.  Good landing.  That thing didn't have a scratch on it.  No.  But, yeah, traffic, rush hour, plane is on the road.  I think even the other way might be a little rubbernecking.  They've got to see how much the toll's going to cost.  For a plane.  Oh, shit.  That's hysterical.  Let's go to Paul in Texas.  Paul.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Paul.  Hi.  Talking about some good old white people music.  Obviously, it's towards the end of the show, so you guys missed it. 
[01:01:30]  But Jeff Beck was on doing a tribute to Paul.  Oh, Jeff Beck.  Nobody listens to Jeff Beck anymore.  Dude, Jeff Beck, what year is this?  That's what I'm saying.  I've been in rock and roll music.  I had to play it on the radio for a number of years.  Jeff Beck.  Ugh.  Never got it to Jeff Beck.  No.  And look where they put him at the end of the show.  Of course.  What?  While the credits were rolling?  Yeah, well, you know, even if you don't like his stuff, you know.  Give me Jeff Beck from the Grammys.  I'm getting...  It was Les Paul.  It was Les Paul. 
[01:02:00]  You got to love that.  All right, Paul, you know what?  I hate Jeff Beck, but I'm going to have an open mind.  And we're going to...  Can we get this performance, Danny Jeff Beck, doing the Les Paul tribute, possibly?  Was there anything that you liked at the Grammys?  We've heard a lot of didn't likes.  Anything I liked.  Let's not be negative Nancy's here.  Anything I liked.  Oh, boy.  Was Avril there?  No, I mean, she hasn't had a...  I know, but she could be there.  She's yesterday's news already.  No, she's not yesterday's news.  Avril Lavigne has staying power, and she can come out with another album and get a single 
[01:02:30]  one.  She's had three albums.  You know what?  I love her proactive acne commercials.  Yeah, I've seen that.  Our fan-fucking-tastic.  She really got that acne on.  She looks so good.  I love how they had to zoom in with the Hubble telescope to find a zit on that girl.  There's one zit on her chin.  And she's like, and now my skin is perfect.  There is something about that girl I can't get around in my head.  She is like my newest, bestest, I'm going to stalk her.  She's your type.  A woman.  I've been an Avril Lavigne fan since day one.  She's got them fangs, them fucked up fangy teeth, and the dark eye makeup. 
[01:03:00]  She's your type.  She'll spray paint her hair green.  She don't care.  And she's dumb, too.  You could trick her into doing stuff.  Dumb as dirt.  You could trick her into marrying you.  Yeah.  Some guy pulled that shenanigan on her.  They're divorced, though.  I know.  I got a chance now.  I'm 41.  She'll marry anyone.  Derek Wibley.  How about you marry Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show?  Okay.  You know what we should do?  What?  Go find, for after the break, everybody that won a Grammy five years ago. 
[01:03:30]  I want to see.  Okay.  I bet you it'll be a bunch of people where you go, oh, that's right.  Remember that person?  And it's only five years ago.  Yeah.  Here's the Jeff Beck thing.  Let's have an open mind.  Yeah.  I'll open it with a fucking gun.  I don't want to hear this.  Jeff Beck.  Let's call tribute.  Oh, this is good. 
[01:04:00]  And remember to buy war bonds to get rid of the Nazi menace and those Japs.  Ah, the Grammys.  Good thing they're not completely invaded by the Negro.  Have a lucky strike.  Lucky strike sponsoring the Grammy Awards.  What is this?  Dribble.  This is the Les Paul tribute by Jeff Beck.  Next thing Andrew says, if that common man touches her, beat him. 
[01:04:30]  That's how we do it back here in the 40s.  That's Jeff Beck.  Yep.  Why is he dyeing his hair?  He's got the soy sauce hair dye, Jimmy.  Soy sauce.  He's very, as a great guitarist, but he's a fucking boar.  Who cares about this?  Never got it.  Exactly.  There are people that love Jeff Beck.  This jazzy, crappy shit.  You know what?  This is what, if white people would make some good, Lady Gaga is white.  Well, that's the point it's making. 
[01:05:00]  But she's got to dress like that, and then pink's got to hang in the fucking sky.  Hold on, there's not a lot of white representation on the Grammys, and we got Jeff Beck?  Really?  Yeah.  Look at Beyonce.  Look at the way she came out.  Oh, look at that.  Here it is.  Her ass is as big as Oprah.  Who's following her?  Are you kidding me?  Beyonce is, did you see E! did the 360 shot?  Yeah, I did.  And then when they got behind Beyonce, her ass is, it's fucking huge.  Big ass.  And not in the way Danny likes.  She was the best thing on that program last night. 
[01:05:30]  Why?  You're so black, Sam.  All right, Kanye.  Just admit it.  I'm just saying she was.  Yeah, where was Kanye in the M&M?  Yeah, what happened?  Where's the M&M?  Well, M&M was there performing.  In the M&M.  Yes, he did.  Look at that ass.  Whose is that?  Look at that.  That's Beyonce's ass with her bathing suit slipping to the side.  Yeah, but that's a few years ago, too, man.  It reveals some cracking.  That's a few years ago.  She looked amazing last night.  Why do you like Beyonce?  Because she's gorgeous.  All the single ladies.  And all her songs are awesome.  Every song she's done has been great.  Name one awesome song by Beyonce. 
[01:06:00]  Well, last night she did If I Were a Boy.  That's a good song.  It's a little slow.  Okay.  That's disrespectful.  This is a performance from the Grammy Awards.  That's not a performance from the Grammy Awards.  Who is this?  That's not a performer at the Grammy Awards.  I thought it was a performer last night.  Annoying Bird.  Is that a band?  No.  It's a singer.  Species.  One thing.  Annoying Bird.  No.  And now, the Grammy for Best New Album goes to Annoying Bird. 
[01:06:30]  And they come up some emo shitheads.  And why didn't MGMT win Best New Artist?  They're not the Best New Artist.  They were fucking in there.  They're better than Kings of Leon.  I don't know.  Kings of Leon made quite a splash this year.  Well, they had a huge song.  Did the Jonas Brothers win anything?  No, the Jonas Brothers have been a little...  But I think you should be giving Grammys out to people that are doing something a little different.  What about that new little eight-year-old boy that sings?  Justin Bieber?  Bieber.  What about him?  Justin Bieber was there with Kesha...  Why was he there with Kesha? 
[01:07:00]  Presenting something.  He wasn't dating.  Oh, holy shit.  But Kesha was very nervous on live TV.  Not the confident, sassy girl that she looks like in the pictures.  Maybe she should have fucking downed a few more drinks.  Kesha's a dirty whore.  That lush.  You think so?  What does she call her look?  Garbage chic or something?  Yeah.  I think she's a little gimmicky.  Of course she is.  Oh, you think you don't think she's quite the person she's putting out there?  I don't think she wakes up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy every morning.  She's a hack.  All right.  But it's a good song. 
[01:07:30]  We proved it with Stalker Patty singing TikTok after she heard the song, what, twice, three  times?  She wouldn't shut up at the bar earlier.  Was she babbling?  Oh, indeed.  I've got to get a recording of that.  It was so...  Yeah, she's like, I'm fucking sitting in behind the music with Patty while I'm sitting listening  to that babbling.  Shut up.  I need a drink.  I always hate when we make her kind of a star for like a few weeks.  I know.  We're idiots.  We are idiots.  She gets confident.  TikTok.  All right.  We'll play TikTok.  TikTok.  We'll finish up our Grammy talk for now with TikTok by Stalker Patty. 
[01:08:00]  So nothing.  You like nothing about the show.  It was very predictable, Sam.  Elton John, TV Nix.  I didn't predict these things.  Honestly, the Elton John...  Beyonce's performance.  She did.  Hold on, hold on.  Alanis Morissette.  I know.  Where was Alanis Morissette?  She should have came out.  Forget Alanis Morissette.  Why Beyonce ripping off Alanis Morissette?  Alanis Morissette cannot stand next to Beyonce and sing and expect people to take her seriously.  I don't know about that.  There's no way.  Alanis Morissette has a much better voice than fucking Beyonce. 
[01:08:30]  You got your mind on that statement.  For real.  For real.  You're crazy on that statement.  For real.  Yo.  And to answer your question, yeah, the Elton John thing was cool.  If MGMT performed, I would have been out of my mind.  It's just very safe, basic shit you're seeing, really.  We're targeting a mainstream audience.  I understand that.  Mainstream.  I mean...  For what country?  For the love of Christ on a pony.  For Rwanda.  You know, I keep hearing about how certain people are not going to be the majority anymore, 
[01:09:00]  but while we still are, can we have some shows?  This is what kids are listening.  You didn't watch the Grammys.  It wasn't as black as usual.  What?  It really wasn't.  Really?  It wasn't as black as usual.  Kings of Leon, Green Day.  No, no, you're getting confused.  It's the Grammys, my friend.  I got to admit, I think past Grammys were a lot blacker than this one.  Other award shows I could see, but the Grammys have predominantly been, you know, that whole  white Americana thing.  Sure.  I mean, obviously.  They played sick.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  They're seeping in, though, Ant.  They're seeping in.  I like Opie's thing.  I want to see who was some Grammy winners from five years ago.  and see what they're doing now.  I say we go back 80 years.  80 years.  Guy winners and get the bit.  This is from 2005.  Album of the year.  Genius, Loves Company, Ray Charles, and various artists.  What's Ray Charles doing now, Sam?  Well, Ray Charles.  The eternal note.  Record of the year.  We picked the wrong year.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe. 
[01:10:00]  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  You can't stop the note.  John Mayer is still doing songs.  Nora Jones is in there.  She hasn't done anything.  She's out of the pop world for sure.  Loretta Lynn.  Loretta Lynn.  Country.  Rap album.  Kanye West.  Kanye West is still in there.  Look at the white people.  John Mayer.  You too.  Loretta Lynn.  But that was rock and country.  I'm sure white people won rock and country this year.  We picked a bad year because it was a Ray Charles year.  He died, right?  Yeah, we got to pick a better year. 
[01:10:30]  Go back six years.  Six years?  Yeah, because he's died.  That's probably the year he died.  Go back six years.  Six years?  Bunch of tributes.  Yeah.  Number one, hit the road, Jack.  Let's see.  Grammy winners, 2004.  All right.  2004 is...  That'll be it.  Isn't too long ago, right?  Yeah, we're right there.  We can read that kind of...  We can read that kind of...  Let's see.  Alternative. 
[01:11:00]  White Stripes.  Right?  White Stripes.  Oh, Record of the Year Coldplay.  Song of the Year.  Richard Marks and Luther Vandross.  Dance with My Father.  Mackenzie Phillips should sing that.  Outkast was album of the year that year.  Nothing?  I like that.  Oh, thank God.  All right.  Yeah.  Again, White Stripes was there.  Okay.  Remember how fucking cool that was?  White Stripes, you're one of the greatest bands of all time.  Well, let's see.  You're a White Stripes fan?  I love the White Stripes.  God bless you, Sam.  They're not a good song.  No, no, no. 
[01:11:30]  Every single song they've ever done is good.  They've got a shitload of stuff.  You like them, Danny?  Classical.  Every song they've done is good.  The Seven Nation Armies, is that what it's called?  Yes.  That's one song I like.  The rest of it is...  Weird Al Yankovic.  One best comedy album.  Oh, he's funny.  Holy fuck.  You sure you went back six years or 26 fucking years?  What song was big by Weird Al Yankovic in 2004?  That was White and Nerdy, I think.  Kind of like Riding Dirty.  He's doing...  It's a poodle hat.  I don't know.  Holy shit, is that fucking unfunny dreck. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, my God.  You know, like Weird Al?  How fucking can you?  Oh, he does a song called eBay?  You know he's a big Weird Al fan?  That's gotta be funny.  Mr. E-Rock.  So don't offend E-Rock.  No, if he is, I swear to Al Yankovic right now.  If that piece of shit is an Al Yankovic fan, I want him out of this fucking building.  I just meant not to offend him.  I didn't hear this.  E-Rock's on the board.  Where's stupid?  Right here.  What do you like about Weird Al Yankovic? 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  I grew up listening to Weird Al Yankovic.  You are a fucking cunt in a hat.  Sorry, we all can't be Aussie fans.  Oh!  I accept your apology.  What happened?  E-Rock.  Wow.  Name one Weird Al Yankovic song that you really can't...  You're equating Weird Al with Aussie.  Name one.  This is idea of heavy.  Oof.  Name a couple of the songs you like. 
[01:13:00]  He did the Nirvana one.  Smells Like Nirvana.  Smells Like Nirvana.  Oh, my God.  Which one did you...  Did you laugh at I Lost on Jeopardy?  Oh, that was a good one.  Or Eat It.  That was a little before my time.  Did you like it?  Was it?  How about It's All About the Pentiums?  Was that a favorite of yours?  Wow.  Oh, that was on...  It's All About the Pentiums and...  We're not the Benjamins.  One of the biggest songs Weird Al had was Amish Paradise.  Ah!  Remember that one?  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah.  Name another one you like, E-Rock. 
[01:13:30]  By the way, as you're answering this, you should be chained upside down by your feet  and your throat should be open like a lamb.  Which means you're running out of time.  Yeah, you should be bleeding out as you answer this question.  Name your Weird Al songs before you die.  Come on.  I'm thinking.  Comedy album of the year.  See, exactly.  What's there to think about?  E-Rock, do you like I'm Fat?  Oh, I get it.  No.  He's just saying that because he knows you're making fun of him.  Hey, wait, can we see who did Al Yankivic beat that year for comedy album? 
[01:14:00]  Can we see who the nominees were for 2004?  And the nominees are Adolf Hitler, the speech from Nuremberg.  It's like, who the fuck?  He was nominated this year, too.  Who else was nominated?  Stephen Colbert.  Colbert did some kind of Christmas album or something?  Does it have to be a musical comedy?  No.  It was comedy variety.  Wow.  But Patton Oswalt's got a nice little mention on the Grammys.  That's pretty solid.  Yeah.  All right.  Should we move on? 
[01:14:30]  I just want to see who Al Yankivic beat in 2004.  Well, stupid E-Rock likes Weird Al, and he can't even come up with any songs.  No.  He's not stupid.  E-Rock, name it a Weird Al song.  Come on.  Top of your head.  Oh, he did.  All right.  I'm losing it.  What about Yabba Dabba Doo now?  Like, give it away?  Was that?  The Red Hot Chili Peppers give it away, but it was Yabba Dabba, Yabba Dabba, Yabba Doo now.  Look, I don't even need to hear it, and I've gotten juice chills so bad. 
[01:15:00]  Play Yabba Dabba Doo.  I want to hear it, E-Rock.  Play Yabba Dabba Doo.  Put on your laughing hat and play it.  He's trying to think of a good Weird Al Yankovic song.  Play it.  I'm looking for it.  Hang on.  Why wouldn't you have Weird Al right in front of you as we talk about it?  I do, but I can't find that one.  How about Another One Rides the Bus?  Or Gump to the Presence of the United States Lump about Forrest Gump.  Oh, wow.  You know what's great about his songs?  They're ageless.  They don't date.  Listen to the words.  He gradually remarked, waiting for the bus with his hands in his pocket. 
[01:15:30]  He just kept saying life is like a bond to chocolate.  He's gump, he's gump, what's in his hand?  Oh, God.  This is morning zoo shit.  He's stupid.  He's gump, he's gump, he's gump, is he in bread?  I never liked this guy.  Oh, my God.  How can you?  Not even as a goof, I never liked him.  John Valby should have won an album award.  Oh, fucking yeah.  Hey, Lottie, Lottie, Lottie.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Grammys present John Valby. 
[01:16:00]  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  He does his cover of fucking the Edmund Fitzgerald, which is hilarious.  A big one they call Itchy Woomy.  That's hilarious.  Did he do Addicted to Spuds?  Oh, here's...  Wait till you hear the words of the...  Goosebumps.  I have them.  He's a multi-millionaire.  Listen to the verse.  I don't know how baby and a bunny got a baby named Bam Bam.  Little Pebbles is his number one fan.  He's a throngest titler in the whole land. 
[01:16:30]  Tear your arm off if you're shaking your hand.  Got a car, gonna push it with my feet now.  Take my family out to eat now.  Jumbo bitch doesn't drive me.  Can you see now?  That's funny.  Yeah.  Want to chill with a finger too tight?  See, Anthony's hiding his face.  Don't go wrong.  Why?  Hey, there's nothing to look at, though, eh?  This is fun.  It's a song.  Do now.  Do now. 
[01:17:00]  B-Rock's in a laugh and his ass off.  The Flintstones, yeah.  B-Rock is laughing.  God, you love Weird Al.  Oh, oh.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff?  Jeff?  Yeah, I'm right here.  So, hold on.  You got more on the breaking news.  Like a small plane just landed on the New Jersey Turnpike.  It's kind of a main highway to get people in and out of New York City, so that's going  to be a major problem today on the roads. 
[01:17:30]  What do you got on that, Jeff?  I'm listening to the scanner.  They're arguing.  The state police are arguing with each other if it's a crash or not.  And now they're arguing about what kind of flatbed truck to bring on board and tow it  over to the maintenance yard by Exit 2.  It's actually hilarious, Karen.  I'm arguing on a scanner.  They're just arguing?  They don't know if it's a crash or not, so they've got to figure that out first.  Oh, Exit 2.  That's way down.  That's more toward Philly, I guess, right?  Yeah.  They said it's on the southbound side. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, okay.  So that's not as bad.  Although I kept thinking of Anthony there when they're arguing back and forth on what  to do with the thing.  Unbelievable.  Why?  If it's a crash in, I guess it's a different procedure?  They've got to leave the plane there?  Yeah, I guess the FAA's got to come and check it out if it's crash.  Oh, shit.  So if it's just a landing, then they could get that damn thing off the highway faster?  I don't think they have to leave it there on the road.  I think the FAA could check it out later.  It wasn't a crash, by the way.  It looks like it was a safe landing. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, now they're moving it.  They're moving it.  Look at it.  And they figured out the flatbed truck because now they're slowly moving it about five miles  an hour on the New Jersey term fight.  They're just towing it.  What are they supposed to do?  If they do 50, it takes off.  You really got to tow a plane slow.  And no one heard after plane makes an emergency landing, and they're slowly, if you're in that  traffic, they're slowly moving this plane about five miles an hour.  Yeah, that thing doesn't even look bent up or nothing.  It takes up the entire width of the turnpike. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  So, all right.  Thank you, sir.  Out here.  All right.  Out.  Oh, look at him.  Should we finally take our...  Yeah, Danny's getting all upset because we have so many reads.  Doesn't matter.  We'll figure it out.  Yeah, we'll blast through them.  War.  War.  I want my salad.  I'll make sure somebody hears that.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Oh, um... 
[01:19:30]  What's wrong with...  Ken in New Hampshire.  Ken.  Yeah, my, uh...  You've forgotten his most famous song, uh...  Hey, Master Bader.  Oh, wait.  That was Anthony.  Ah, yes.  That is true.  Love it.  Love it.  We'll go to break with this.  That was also 19-fucking-95.  I've...  Oh, Christ.  This is...  This is horrible.  Jimmy...  Jimmy's laughing very hard at me. 
[01:20:00]  A lot of radio stations fucking played this thing.  It was almost a hit.  In the Weird Al world.  The song was a big hit.  And I decided to parody it.  That's what I used to do.  I've moved on, though.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'm not Weird Al.  Laying down the towel, so I keep my car between.  Sing?  Say, let's check it off.  I do it in my car while I'm driving down the street.  One hand on the wheel and the other on my knees.  I can't get out the car because I'm sticking to the seat. 
[01:20:30]  Hey, it came all over myself.  It's not bad.  All right, look.  We're going to break.  Go be, Nancy.  Stay there.  Stay there.  Oh.  Avatar made another $30 million over the weekend.  That's it?  I think it's over $2 billion made now, right?  Breaks $2 billion.  Holy ass.  That fucking James Cameron must just laugh his ass off. 
[01:21:00]  Like, I can't believe I did it again.  I cannot believe I did it again.  And I curse Anthony this morning.  Well, I don't.  I took your recommendation and I saw Star Trek finally.  Because I'm not a big Trekkie guy.  Yeah.  Even when J.J. Abrams was in here selling the movie, I was thinking to myself, wow, I got  to see that movie.  And it took a while.  Yeah.  I finally saw it over the weekend.  God damn it, is that a good movie.  Yeah.  That's pretty fucking good.  And you don't have to know fucking Star Trek.  Just like you said.  No.  No, you don't.  It's one of those, you know, if you know Star Trek, it's cool. 
[01:21:30]  If you don't.  I watched enough of Star Trek growing up that some of the things they did, I kind of got.  Yeah.  But I'm sure there was other stuff that was too deep for me because I'm not a big Trekkie  guy.  Yeah.  There were some little inside jokes that if you're into Star Trek, that over the years  they kind of had goofed on and made fun of that they threw in the movie.  Like, him fucking the green broad was like, you know, that's obviously a joke.  Yeah.  He never actually fucked the green broad.  Which was a pretty funny scene. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Um, and, uh, uh, I curse you because the letter Nimoy, I, I, you got like some talking  over his dentures.  You know, when he, when he appears in this, you are James secret, but when he appears  in this movie for the first time, it's, it's a pretty, it's a pretty big moment and it's  blown because of your damn impression of what, what the scene is.  Him yapping over those giant dentures that are just about ready to fall out of his mouth 
[01:22:30]  at any given moment.  But, uh, God, the movie was good.  Yeah.  It's grateful.  Oh, you saw it too, Jimmy?  I loved it.  I saw an answer.  I saw a fucked up version.  That was the fucked up fucking bootleg.  I haven't seen the good version with the real movie.  Oh, the good version.  It's totally fucking, it's so much better than that shitty bootleg.  And I also curse Avatar because now every movie I see, I'm like, why can't this be in  3D?  It's like, that would've been good on 3D.  That's what fucking Avatar did tell all of us.  3D.  Because with all those explosions and flying through space and, and even the bridge, you 
[01:23:00]  know, the U.S. Enterprise to begin with.  Yep.  All that in 3D would've looked really cool.  Yeah, I know.  There's, they're going to make, uh, a franchise out of that one.  You can tell.  Not so obvious.  They got a fuckload of money, so they'll probably do it in 3D.  I wouldn't dude it.  Are they already filming the next one?  I think they're, they're writing already.  They have another story.  Uh, yeah.  But it's, they should have, they should already be filming this.  Keep our interest.  Pop these movies out. 
[01:23:30]  One a year.  Let's go.  I think someone's a little busy.  But lost.  Who?  Well.  Oh, J.J.  Yeah, J.J.'s a little busy.  Is he still involved with that?  I don't know.  He's got to cash the checks, for the love of God.  Well, the problem is, too, if you get the, I don't know the actor that plays, uh, Kirk,  but I'm sure he's got other projects.  Yeah.  So you gotta wait for him to be freed up.  But you gotta wait for the whole cast to be freed up.  I think that other guy's in Heroes.  Is he still in Heroes?  I don't know.  I don't watch that show.  But, uh, damn.  He's my guy.  Uh, the chase scene at the beginning of Star Trek when, uh, Kirk is a little kid. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  With the car.  With the police officer that's off the ground on his motorcycle or whatever.  That was pretty good.  That was a cool scene, man.  Little rebel Kirk.  Oh, well.  They made that obvious.  Let's go to Matt in North Carolina.  Matt.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Um, just wanted to call and let you know how the, uh, taser training went.  Yeah, we were talking about, uh, tasering once again last week.  And you said you had to, you had to go through the training and you would call us back after  you, you got, you know, a jolt of electricity. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just getting off work this morning.  And, uh, look, I'm, I'm 6'1", 6'2", 240 pounds.  I played college football and it turned me into a sniveling fucking baby.  And how long did they hit you?  Uh, took the full five second ride with the probes and everything.  Oh.  And is five seconds a lot?  Fuck, a split second would be enough.  Huh?  It felt like 10 minutes.  It was awful. 
[01:25:00]  With the barbs?  Oof.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Ow.  Where, right to the back?  Yeah, yeah.  It was about a, uh, I don't know.  It was probably about 14 inch spread because he didn't shoot me from very far away.  What were you wearing?  Just a sleeveless t-shirt.  So you got, did the barbs get into your skin?  Absolutely.  Fuck that.  Oh, shit.  That's fantastic.  This is what I want to, this is what I want to know, though.  As soon as they stop tasering you, is that the proper tasing?  I would guess, yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah. 
[01:25:30]  Uh, does, does the feeling go away immediately?  It, it, it, the, the lock of your muscles goes away, but your, your joints still feel like  they need to unlock.  But you feel all your muscles just like, what, lock up like you said?  Yeah, it's, it's awful.  And, uh, I, I, Jimmy said he wanted to try to take a ride.  He said he would try it.  And I'd be more than willing to drive up from North Carolina to hit Jimmy with it.  Why you don't like me, sir?  No, I love you, Jimmy.  I love you, but.  I'd be scared of it. 
[01:26:00]  Like, I would do it, but I know I would, I would go like, blah, blah, make, make some  sound.  All I got out was a muffled fuck in my face at the mat.  Blah!  Were the boys, were the good old boys laughing at you and shit?  Oh, yeah.  They were supposed to hold me up, but I, uh, I, I about broke my nose on the mat, so.  Where, where did they shoot you?  What part of your body, your arm?  No, no, it was in my back.  Uh, he shot me from about, I'd say about seven or eight feet away.  Were you shirtless?  He had a shirt on.  He said. 
[01:26:30]  I just had a thin shirt on.  Jesus.  Um, uh, I don't think there's anyone in this organization of ours that would, would do that.  No.  I'm trying to think if any of us, I, I, no way would I do it.  E-Rock, would you do it?  We could probably get E-Rock to do it, but, uh, obviously no one could do it.  E-Rock, would you do it for real?  Uh, I guess so.  Yeah.  Really?  Um, cause we could probably get this done.  We could probably do it with, uh, under police supervision and all that whole thing.  Sign a waiver.  Right.  Um, give up your first born. 
[01:27:00]  Things like that.  What would management say?  All right.  Throw that idea away.  Well, but I mean, there's, there's a, there's a rule that says you're not supposed to tase anyone  under 90 pounds and E-Rock is definitely over that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He'll make that.  Even on the moon.  And, and, and heart conditions, which he might have, but.  Oh, yeah.  Uh.  All right.  I am, man.  Well, why don't, why don't the boys down the hall and run it upstairs? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  That'd be fun to watch.  All right.  Police.  I'm gonna punch out and go to bed.  All right, Matt.  Thank you, man.  Thanks for that.  All police, uh, supervised and everything.  You know, like when they do those D-Wee things.  Yeah, they do it all the time.  Where people come in, they drink on the job and then, uh, and then they, they breathalyze  you.  We ought to have one of those shows.  They change you for five seconds?  Sometimes.  No, I couldn't take a split second.  I couldn't take stupid Robert Kelly's, uh, uh, Bobby Kelly's pen.  You didn't like that? 
[01:28:00]  The pen?  The shocky pen?  No, I didn't like that at all.  Yeah, I didn't either.  I don't like being electric shocked.  It's not fun, right?  Like, he doesn't have a game, like those stupid games in the old arcades where you'd  hold on.  Like at Disneyland, you'd go into the arcade there and you'd have to hold on to the metal  post and the, the gauge would go up and see how cool you are and you're just kind of  like, yeah.  Could you hold on for a while?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was like, you know, oh, is this the tasing?  I guess.  I'm looking at his belt loop here so it's not going to be actually touching his skin. 
[01:28:30]  Let's try it three seconds.  He isn't even shooting him.  He's putting the clips on.  Oh, that's how they do it.  So it doesn't get jammed.  Let's see how that works.  And it's not touching the skin?  No.  It's on his shirt and shorts.  It doesn't have to touch the skin.  To be effective, it doesn't have to touch the skin?  Yeah.  We're trying to capture the big glutes and the hamstring here.  Tighten those up and see how they work out.  And are you ready?  Yeah.  You always say taser, taser. 
[01:29:00]  You want how many seconds?  Three.  Three?  You sure?  Yeah.  Three is a long time.  All right.  Three seconds.  How do you feel now?  Wow.  You can get up, right?  Yeah.  You're done.  Hit him again.  I hit him again.  I hit him again.  You're coming down.  And they all have to do this?  Yeah.  Oh, they don't actually shoot you. 
[01:29:30]  Okay.  Those muscles?  Those muscles are right.  They're close.  I guess that's one type.  Sometimes they, I guess, some training, they shoot you.  Right, right.  Some they flip it on.  Some they give you the old bam on the side.  That's why I'm wondering about this Matt guy that just called us, because the video we're  seeing, the guy's completely on the ground, his face in the mat, his arms spread, and  Matt's saying he stood, and they were supposed to hold him, and he almost broke his nose  as he hit the mat. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  You would think they would control it a little better.  Hey, Anthony, Black History Month.  Yes, it is Black History Month.  You asked and you received.  And our Black History Month bit is back.  Ah.  What bit?  What do you mean a bit?  Oh, um, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean, uh, I mean,  recognition, I mean, uh, of, I mean, I, I, I, I, this is, this is, this is, now,  acknowledgement, acknowledgement, good. 
[01:30:30]  Every show acknowledges Black History Month in their own way, and usually they pay tribute  to famous black history, uh, people in history, uh, inventors, um, uh, philosophers,  uh, of course, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, and, uh, whatnot, um, Frederick Douglass,  um, uh, uh, uh, Miss Jane Pittman.  Who are them other?  I know, I was trying to do it, too.  It doesn't work, though.  Who are some of those other black people? 
[01:31:00]  They black pretty good.  Uh, I don't know.  Will Chamberlain, Jesse Owens.  Manute Ball.  Manute Ball.  Well, let's see who, who we're, uh, looking at today for Black History Month.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is paying tribute to those legendary  African Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today. 
[01:31:30]  Today, we honor Larry Blackman, the lead singer from Cameo,  the funk-influenced R&B group who penned the 1986 hit single, Word Up.  Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance, quick, mama, come on, baby, tell me, what's the word up, word up?  Your catchy words will forever remain an inspiration to us all, Larry.  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I was listening to Tool over the weekend, still fucking amazing, on lithium. 
[01:32:00]  I did a little lithium, and I got to tell you, Sirius XM, I think they changed one of their classic rock stations,  classic rewind, I think. Maybe someone could get me some info.  It was like, ah, fuck. I don't have my thoughts together, really, on this one. 
[01:32:30]  But they changed up to music, so it's more classic rock from, like, the 80s on, you know what I mean?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So music we kind of liked, that no radio station is really playing because there's no place for it.  Right.  You know what I mean? Because you got rock stations in the regular radio world that are either hardcore classic rock,  so you got the Stones, the Doors, Zeppelin, all that, or you got, you know...  Those are oldies now.  Yeah.  Or current rock, so they don't have room to play. 
[01:33:00]  Like, they had dumb Robert Plant doing In the Mood.  You know what I mean? A song I haven't heard in a while.  I'm like, you know what? Yeah, I want to hear that.  You give that a listen?  In the Mood?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's all right.  I'm not going to, like, jump up and down, but...  It was just a song I haven't heard in a while.  I have, like, eight tomatoes left. I'm not putting this down.  I love tomatoes.  They're good for you. They're cancer prevention and shit. Tomatoes are healthy.  Tomatoes?  Yeah, man.  I like the blueberries.  I never saw a tomato getting chemo, so I guess you're right.  That's funny.  Yes.  These tomatoes are pretty good. 
[01:33:30]  Anyway, so...  Jay Leno was on Oprah. We couldn't get to this on Friday because we had a very busy show.  We had to look at fucking Bobo's penis for an hour.  Absolutely.  And his vagina asshole.  And his vagina asshole.  His asshole looks like a dirty vagina.  Yeah. It's a slit.  Bobo...  I think Bobo is taking some cock.  Yeah.  I think he's taking some cock.  Shit, he's beautiful.  I think he has. I think you're right.  You think he has, Ant?  Yeah.  It's awful. 
[01:34:00]  His whole story is just awful.  It's just horrendous.  Poor fuck.  But we spent way too much time on Bobo and never got to the Jay Leno and Oprah thing.  And me and Jimmy were talking about this during the break.  I just don't get it with this hate for Jay Leno.  I really don't.  And it's gotten so bad that I actually try to step outside this whole thing.  Because, you know, we have a connection to Jay a little bit.  We were lucky enough to do the show once.  Obviously, Jimmy's doing it on a regular basis.  And Leno was just such a nice guy to us.  I just don't see it. 
[01:34:30]  It seems like the country is seeing it.  And he sat down with Oprah.  And I'm trying to figure out why people hate fucking Leno.  I know.  I know I'm very, very biased, too, because of my connection with him.  So, of course, I'm going to be very biased.  But even stepping back, I can't.  I understand why Letterman doesn't like him.  And I understand why Conan doesn't like him.  Of course.  I'm not that stupid.  I get that.  Because he doesn't like him.  Why?  Because she felt slighted.  I'm not saying I agree with her.  But how the fuck does she feel slighted?  That's delusional. 
[01:35:00]  That's self-entitlement.  Again, she's crazy.  But self-entitlement, like Anthony's saying.  She wanted Jay to step aside and give her one night a week.  That's ridiculous.  Of course it is.  But I understand why she's mad.  When you want something and you don't get it, you react angrily.  Right.  So I know why she doesn't like him.  Well, but I don't respect the fact that she's mad.  Me neither.  Not at all.  I think she's ridiculous.  And self-centered and delusional.  Thank you.  Okay, now I'm with you.  But I mean, I comprehend why.  And Dave, well, he was losing to him.  And he feels like Jay was a guest on his show.  And then he feels Jay screwed him out.  So I understand certain people, why they don't like him. 
[01:35:30]  But I don't understand why Kimmel doesn't like him.  Unless there's obviously stuff I don't know.  But I don't know why Kimmel has a thing for him.  And the public, it's weird.  It's like these nerds are like online.  Like, he's our guy.  It's like, you don't give a shit about late night television.  Shut up.  They just, he represents something.  He represents what they see as a changing of the guard was happening.  And then they see it went back to the old guard.  Because they don't know exactly what happened.  And all these people saying that Jay Leno should just step aside. 
[01:36:00]  Why?  Why the fuck should he?  Why the fuck should he is right.  And if your company's, you know, going to you and saying, hey, you can have your old job back.  Like Jay said on Oprah, who wouldn't take that offer?  Of course you would.  And Jay was number one.  Like, I could see if Jay Leno was slipping.  Even if he was number two.  I'm like, okay, maybe his better days are behind him.  But the guy was forced to leave because of this weird deal NBC made.  He was forced to leave when he was still number one.  And maybe a nice margin, by the way, too. 
[01:36:30]  And how come the Conan fans, again, and I'm not talking about the ones who love Conan, but the ones who are just vehemently crucifying Jay.  And the guys that have called in, I mean, you're always welcome to call in and express your opinion.  But how come those guys aren't saying that it was fucked up, that Jay was number one, and Conan was threatening to walk unless he got promised a Tonight Show in 2004?  Right.  And again, I understand why Conan would want it.  But it's like they're just vilifying Jay for taking the show back.  It's like, fuck these people.  I've really had enough of these fucking faggots complaining. 
[01:37:00]  Like, all these fans going, he should just walk away.  Why should he just walk away?  Fucking asshole.  Would you?  The one guy called up and goes, he should do a show on cars.  Go fuck yourself.  You work all those years.  You're a workaholic.  And this isn't any job.  And you're the best at what you do.  And you should just step down.  Go fuck yourself.  And the other thing I don't understand, people are just assuming that if Jay walked away, then NBC would have stayed with Conan O'Brien.  But no.  If Jay leaves, if Jay would have left, or if Jay leaves now, well, now it's kind of too late, obviously. 
[01:37:30]  But they weren't going to keep Conan.  His ratings were down 50% or 49% officially.  NBC was making the decision to go with another person for late night.  Personally, I think it was Comcast.  People are forgetting that a new boss took over.  And I think that what was happening was the new boss came in and said, this is not going to stay.  Fix it.  And I think that's what happened.  But people want to ignore that. 
[01:38:00]  If Jay didn't quote the right thing and walked away so Conan could continue with his dream.  The fact is, NBC already made the decision.  We're done with Conan already.  Seven months, in my opinion, is ridiculously not enough time, obviously.  But with that said, they weren't going to stay with Conan no matter what.  I just cannot believe when I hear people saying he should just step aside when the guy was still number one.  It makes you want to smack people.  And then they're like, quit licking letters there.  Why should the number one guy leave?  I don't comprehend that, you fucking assholes out there, who think that a guy should just walk away because you want your guy to be in there. 
[01:38:30]  Shut the fuck up.  Just walk away.  Holy shit.  Just walk away.  Asshole.  Asshole.  It's never happened with a number one guy who's been yanked off.  Never.  Well, I think Leno put it perfectly.  I think we have a lot of clips from the Oprah show.  We won't do that to you.  But we have one that I think is worth playing.  I think this is the one where Jay explains it perfectly.  You know, they made this offer to me.  And I said, do you think Conan will go for this? 
[01:39:00]  And they said, we'll ask him tomorrow.  I said, okay, let me know what happens.  And then next thing you know, I guess Conan had his article in the paper and that was that.  Yeah, Conan said that he thought it would be destructive to the franchise and that if he felt that shot.  Well, if you look at where the ratings were.  Yeah.  It was already destructive to the franchise.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  But he said that he did not want to take the hour at 12.05.  Well, there was no discussion on it.  You know, the last discussion I had was it looks like he was going to go for it. 
[01:39:30]  And then he publicly said no.  And by that time, it had pretty much hit the fan and everything was all over the place.  And there wasn't a lot of talking going on.  Well, I guess I was wrong.  That was not the clip.  Do you know the next morning, I was on the Leno show the next night.  I did a panel thing.  Right.  And he came in the dressing room and we were just talking about what was going on.  And he just said.  I thought you were going to go in tears.  In tears.  Hugging each other.  Holding each other.  How awkward would that be if he grabbed you crying and was just like right in your ear, 
[01:40:00]  Jimmy, I don't know what to do.  And just blamed me for the failure.  Yes.  And he goes, we were talking.  And he goes, I think Conan made a mistake last night when he quit.  Like he said he thought Conan made a mistake when he didn't agree to do.  Like maybe he thought that a strong 1130 lead in which he would have given.  You know, who knows?  Yeah.  But he did say that.  So.  All right.  I got the.  I got the.  Well, that clip was good anyway.  But here's I think here's the one I'm talking about where Jay explains it perfectly.  Perfect.  I always felt I was doing the right thing.  And you go, how can you do the right thing and just have it go so wrong? 
[01:40:30]  Maybe I'm not doing the right thing.  I would say maybe I'm doing something wrong.  And this many people are angry and upset over a television show.  I mean, I had a show.  My show got canceled.  They weren't happy with the other guy's show.  They said, we want you to go back.  I said, OK, who wouldn't take that job, though?  Who wouldn't do that?  It's fucking amazing.  I haven't seen.  That's a great question.  Who wouldn't do that?  I have real.  It's easy as you're looking in. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, wow.  He's got to.  He should step aside like Conan, you know, have his dream.  But really put yourself in that position with your job or whatever.  Yeah.  You're going to do that.  You're going to let some younger guy come in and take over your job, even though you're still great at your job.  Really?  I don't see.  Let him step aside.  That would do that.  I don't see Dave saying, you know what?  Conan, I feel like you got screwed by a bad guy.  Come take my position.  I don't feel like anybody who has said Jay should just walk away has ever walked away.  You know what I got from that clip? 
[01:41:30]  Jay is a scumbag.  Terrible man.  That's what I got from that.  Would you walk away?  That is perfect, too.  Hey, hey, hey, asshole, glass house, rock throwing motherfuckers.  Would you just walk away from that gig if your boss came to you and said, hey,  we'd like you to come back and have your old job, your old pay, your old fucking, all your old boys around you and everything.  And you're going to go, no, under the principles in which I live my life, you could take your job. 
[01:42:00]  Yes, please.  I'll take it.  Of course.  Shut up.  And if he says no in that spot, that doesn't mean that they're going to stay with Conan.  At that point, they would go and see who else is out there.  There were rumors that they were interested in Seinfeld.  Yay.  And they asked him how he was, and he said he was heartbroken when they took the show.  And he's like, yeah, I fibbed a little.  I mean, that's just Jay's way of saying he towed the company line.  So anyone that doesn't agree, it's like, I don't want to talk about this all day, but I'm always up for hearing people who don't agree.  It's like, I have not heard one of you present me with a reason why he should walk away. 
[01:42:30]  And once again, the phones are lit.  A few people are like, why are you talking about this again?  Well, because it's still.  Because it was just on Oprah.  Why did you see?  Because it's still a hot topic.  By the way, what are the hot topics today?  Oh, my God.  We didn't get our show prep from.  We'll ask that question.  Maybe the listeners will have their hot topics for us.  That's fantastic.  But, and then Jimmy Kimmel had a little clip.  You want to listen to the Jimmy Kimmel clip?  Yeah, I've not seen it.  Because they talked about how Jimmy Kimmel went on Leno to do the 10 out of 10 and blindsided Jay. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  Just making fun of the whole situation, which was great TV.  It was a lot of fun to watch.  A lot of jokes in there.  And then Jay took it pretty good.  Took it actually really well.  He aired it, yeah.  And Oprah asked him about that whole thing.  And then Kimmel had his response.  Danny, we got that.  Sorry, Han.  Yeah.  Jay Leno today sat down for a very serious talk with Oprah. 
[01:43:30]  There was no studio audience, just Jay and Oprah speaking titan to titan.  And it's kind of funny because, you know, celebrities usually go on Oprah with these intense, serious interviews to get support from the public after they had sex with their father or married Bobby Brown or something.  Jay Leno went on because they gave him the Tonight Show back.  So, please, keep him in your prayers.  Oprah was pretty forthright with Jay.  She told him that she thought a joke he made about David Letterman was, quote, beneath him and acknowledged that 95% of her audience they polled was on Conan's side. 
[01:44:00]  And then Oprah asked Jay about me.  You've made a living making jokes about other people during their difficult times.  Right.  So, did you, you thought you were fair game?  Even for Jimmy Kimmel, when Jimmy Kimmel was on?  Again, I had Jimmy Kimmel on my show.  And, yeah, I got sucker punched.  You're known for pranks.  What's the best prank you ever pulled?  I told a guy that five years from now, I'm going to give you my show. 
[01:44:30]  And then when the five years came, I gave it to him.  And then I took it back almost instantly.  It's my show.  I could have edited it.  But I said, no, no.  Put it out there.  I walked into it.  Did you know he was going that far?  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  Oh.  Yeah.  The jokes about the cars.  That's okay.  That's okay.  I got sucker punched.  But, you know, when you get sucker punched, you just get right back up again.  You don't whine and complain and go, I'm going to take that out.  He said something bad about me.  That's all right.  Now, I don't know that I would characterize going on a comedy show and making jokes qualifies as a sucker punch, right? 
[01:45:00]  I mean, that, but as long as Jake's talking about it, you want to know what the real story is?  What really happened?  By the way, it'd be funnier if you said no.  Nah, I was kind of sick of that.  Make fun of the Gosselins or something.  Here's the story.  A couple weeks ago, I did a show where I dressed up like Jay Leno and impersonated him.  And Cleto dressed like his cackling band leader and impersonated him. 
[01:45:30]  We had a lot of fun at their expense.  We really did.  So the next morning, Jay calls me.  I was in a meeting.  They said, Jay Leno is on the phone.  And I said, oh, great.  This will be comfortable.  But he got on the phone and said, oh, I thought it was funny.  Now, I'm almost positive that was a lie, but I take his word for it because why not?  So then about an hour later, the Jay Leno show calls.  And they asked me to do the 10 at 10, which is where Jay interviews somebody via satellite and asks 10 questions.  So I said, yes, assuming that we're going to talk about what's going on in late night.  Now, before they do these 10 to 10 interviews, our producer calls to go over all the questions. 
[01:46:00]  And then you're supposed to go on the show and act like you're surprised by the questions as they come.  So I get on the phone with the producer and he goes through about 30 questions.  Almost none of them have anything to do with what's going on in late night.  The question is like, what's your junk food weakness?  And, you know, I say to the guy, you know, a little bit of this is fine.  But I really think we have to talk about what's going on with Jay and Conan because that's what people want to hear about.  Not about my junk food weakness. 
[01:46:30]  I weigh more than 200 pounds.  All junk foods are my weakness.  So he says, he says, yeah, I know, we'll talk about it.  But there's been a lot of talk about this stuff and we don't want to beat it to death.  But what he did not understand is I did want to beat it to death.  I wanted to, I like beating things to death.  And so I did.  Because if I go on that show and answer 10 questions about junk food, I'm the one that looks like a jerk. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, hey, Jay.  Oh, I love Raisinets.  I really.  Now, if I made any mistake, it was thinking Jay would have anything to say other than what was written on the cue cards during the interview.  I figured I'd start in.  He'd get into it.  We'd mix it up.  You know, at one time he was a comedian.  But he just, he didn't do that.  And he, he stood there and he just kind of read through the questions like a robot.  And then he goes on Oprah and rats me out to Oprah. 
[01:47:30]  That's a sucker punch right there.  When I go to Oprah and say that, it's like, she's a paddle cat.  Oprah and I had a wonderful relationship and now it's ruined because of Jay.  And by the way, watch out, Oprah.  Don't think he won't take your show next.  I don't, I always thought television was different than radio.  It's all the same stupid business. 
[01:48:00]  My only issue is like, I understand why Kimmel wanted to talk about it, of course.  Yeah.  But it's like when you say like, I promised the guy my show in 2004 and then took it back five years later.  I mean, it's a funny line when he did the 10 of 10.  Yeah.  But it's almost like, you know, better.  Yeah.  You know, he didn't take the show.  You know what happened.  So it's like, not that you can't be funny like that, but it's like, come on, you know what happened.  So don't get really angry about it.  So, and fast forward, you know, Kimmel's an older guy now.  And, uh, you know, the same offer is put to Kimmel.  He's going to step aside. 
[01:48:30]  Really?  Yeah.  These guys are really going to step aside.  Don't take it.  That's the question.  Yeah.  Really?  They're going to step aside?  No, they're not.  None of these guys are going to step aside if it was about them.  Uh, let's go to Mike in Connecticut.  Mike.  Hey.  Mike.  Hiya, Mike.  Hey, guys.  Hey, I guess the question I have is, um, when they first came to Jay, whenever, way back  when, when they told him, uh, they were going to, you know, take his show away from him  and give it to Conan in five years or whatever.  And he had the number one show.  He was number one. 
[01:49:00]  You guys keep on talking about how he was number one.  He was number one show.  At that point, why didn't he just tell them to go fuck themselves?  Listen, I'm number one.  I'm not doing it.  I'm not going for it.  You know, it's just like, yeah, okay, yeah, I'm a good guy, I'm a good guy.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me answer you.  Because in a position like that, you're under contract and it's almost like when they kill  a character off.  Now, I'm sure they've killed characters off on TV who didn't want to be killed off, but  they do it.  It's not like they don't show up.  People say, well, if you don't want to be killed off, just don't show up to work that  day and film the scene. 
[01:49:30]  You have to.  And maybe he could have done more, but to me, that would have been self-destructive and he's  a smart dude and he didn't whine about it.  Just like he didn't complain that the critics were killing him.  He didn't whinge about it.  He just stayed number one.  So that's probably why he towed the company line.  And if you want to say, why didn't Jay be honest?  How come you're not saying, hey, how come Conan didn't go on his show that night and go,  you know what?  My people said that if I didn't get the Tonight Show, I would leave in five years.  So they gave in.  How come Conan, both of them towed the company a lot.  Isn't that fair to say? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, they're both BSing.  I don't stay up that late to watch Conan, so I really don't know.  But I'm saying they replayed the clips recently.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  They both towed the company line.  Plus, I would love to know what Leno's contract was all about.  Maybe it wasn't that easy just to walk away.  If you really think he doesn't have an agent, like he says, I don't believe that.  You don't have to.  You don't have to believe it.  But I know how he negotiates with his own writers.  I understand that he is a lawyer.  He's a very, very big lawyer. 
[01:50:30]  He's probably the most powerful guy in Hollywood.  And a lawyer is just as big as having an agent if you really want to know the truth.  Yes.  Is it Ron?  Ron the lawyer.  So, sir, let me ask you, what should he have done?  And you're not saying that Conan should have done the same thing?  I don't think Conan had as much juice as Jay.  I mean, I don't think Conan could have done that.  I think Jay could have done that because of who he is.  He didn't have as much juice as Jay.  He got them to promise him the Tonight Show while Jay was number one. 
[01:51:00]  That sounds like a lot of juice to me.  What have the goddamn juice got to do with it?  All right, sir.  It sounded like it was more like an executive decision to do this with the two shows.  Not really Conan convincing them to do it.  It sounds like it was an executive decision.  Do you have any idea how naive you sound?  It was executives who ultimately made the decision, but Conan has come out and said he had a </pre>
