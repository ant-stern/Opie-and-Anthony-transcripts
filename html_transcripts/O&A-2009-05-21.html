<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing mundane matters like the day of the week and technical difficulties, punctuated by Anthony's detailed description of a severe sunburn incurred from napping in his backyard.  His frustrations with his delayed pool opening due to marble dusting complications dominated a portion of the early show.  A caller, Scott from Iowa, added commentary on Anthony's sunburn.  This transitioned into a discussion of Rich Voss's previous day's blunder—revealing his passwords on air—followed by more sunburn anecdotes from the hosts and a caller, Jimmy from New Hampshire, who shared a humorous tale of a pinstripe tan.  The conversation then unexpectedly shifted to American Idol’s Adam Lambert and speculation surrounding his sexuality, leading to a humorous exchange about pictures of the hosts and others kissing.  A lengthy segment then focused on the UFC Undisputed 2009 video game, with Anthony ("Chopped Meat" in-game) detailing his virtual fighting career.  The show concluded this segment with a discussion of Vince McMahon’s conflict with the Denver Nuggets over an arena, featuring commentary from Sam Roberts, and brief mentions of the New York Yankees and Mets, ending with a giveaway of UFC Undisputed 2009 games.

The next segment started with a discussion of Long Island strippers, alcohol-free Long Island Iced Teas, and the upcoming "Country Soda Kenny" country radio demo. This flowed into a recap of the previous day's show, featuring guests Rich Voss (described as exceptionally stupid and funny) and Andrew Dice Clay (whose tendency to dominate the show was noted), along with Bonnie McFarlane (Voss's partner). The hosts recounted their awkward attempts to probe Bonnie about her relationship with Rich.  The show then introduced Lydia, a clinical psychologist, whose appearance sparked considerable banter from the hosts, before the conversation turned to her work with middle school children and their prevalent sexual concerns. Lydia voiced concerns about Anthony's isolation, drinking, and anti-government views.  The discussion segued into Lydia's personal life, including her difficult relationship with her alcoholic mother, her marriage to Gary, and details about her breast implants.  Gary joined the conversation, leading to more discussion about their relationship and drinking habits.  The segment ended with calls about child discipline and a five-year-old daughter touching herself.

The following segment continued the theme of children's sexuality and behavior, featuring listener calls about various concerning behaviors in young children, including nudity, foot fetishes, and aggression. Lydia provided professional input throughout.  A caller detailed a difficult divorce and strained relationships with his children, and another recounted the tragic death of his teenage daughter, partly blaming his ex-wife.  Kenny attempted another country radio DJ demo, using crude humor.  The hosts interspersed jokes and sarcastic comments, focusing on sexual innuendo.  Discussions included spanking and the effects of parental conflict.  The segment concluded with the hosts discussing a picture of Lydia that Opie tweeted, focusing on her physical attributes.

The final segment began with a discussion surrounding Rich Voss's accidental password revelation and the subsequent hacking of his accounts, involving humorous commentary from the hosts and Bonnie McFarlane.  A brainstorming session for potential radio gigs for Kenny followed, exploring various musical genres and accents.  Listener calls were interspersed, including a heated exchange with a caller criticizing Sam Roberts' radio voice.  A lengthy segment focused on listener-submitted "greatest treats of all time" combinations.  The show concluded with the hosts consuming ribs and turkey chili, discussing a news story about a Jesus-shaped Cheeto, and wrapping up the broadcast.  Vulgar language and offensive topics were frequent throughout the segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  And we get to do it again!  On Thrusty. Is it Thursday already?  Yeah, that kind of kicks ass. I was thinking that.  I rationalize the days of the week all the time.  And this time I was like, it's Wednesday, this was yesterday.  I go, now tomorrow, I'll be able to say tomorrow's Friday. 
[00:00:30]  And now look, tomorrow's Friday.  We should, by the way, it's Tinny again.  I know.  I don't like the sounds here on the Opian Chopped Meat Show.  It's, oh, Chopped Meat.  Yeah, we're going to talk about Chopped Meat in a second.  Chopped Meat.  Oh, I got something else about Chopped Meat that you're going to enjoy.  Yes.  I'm surprised you haven't noticed yet.  The fact that he went tanning last night on Venus.  Right, you didn't notice.  Of course I did.  I wanted to say, are you sick, red face?  Let me smoke them. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, yes.  I might have had a cocktail or two.  Looks like someone might have passed out in their backyard yesterday.  We need that button pushed, I think.  Yeah, whatever button.  It does sound tinny.  What was it yesterday?  Yeah, Mars has the secret button that takes the tinny sound out of the...  I don't think he's got it in him today.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Mars.  Oh, boy.  Is that better?  That's better.  Yeah.  It's better.  All right.  Let me see.  Let me see.  I liked it the other way.  No, that's good.  Ew, the other way sucked.  Yeah, I like it this way.  No, this is tinny. 
[00:01:30]  I like this one.  That's horrible.  All right.  Let's broadcast it.  I don't like this.  What?  This one?  I refuse.  This is much better.  No.  Yeah, that's much better.  Over here.  I like this one.  That one's good.  This?  Does someone have a sledgehammer?  I just want to hit...  Not the board.  I just want to hit Opie's fingers with it.  How about this?  Let's do a hearing test.  This?  Beep.  Or this?  Beep.  Oh, yeah.  No, no.  No!  What?  That's the one we need.  Yeah, Jimmy, why don't you ask Anthony to show off his early summer tan? 
[00:02:00]  I saw it.  I kept looking at Anthony.  No, you haven't seen it yet.  And I'm like, is that red?  Because Anthony has a hat on, so you can't tell if it's a shadow.  But his little red face.  Yes.  I just want to put a little lotion on and then slap it on you.  Jimmy, it's not a red face.  It's half a red face.  Yeah, I got close encounters, red face.  I got where...  Yeah, why don't you turn more to the...  That's it?  See, there's not much on the other side.  See, this side is pretty red. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, that's hilarious.  And like...  I went home yesterday, and what a beautiful day here in New York.  Yesterday.  It was amazing.  The first really nice day we've had in quite a while.  It's been rainy, or cold, or just shit weather.  And get home.  It's really nice out.  So I got these big, cushy lounge chairs for the backyard.  And I was finally able to go into the cabana and take the cushions out. 
[00:03:00]  And the cushions are like friggin'...  They're about a foot deep, these things.  Very soft.  Very nice.  So I lay down, and I put my iPod on, and just...  Out!  Out!  And I guess about two hours later, Keith the cop and the pool guy come over to discuss  more of the opening of my pool, which is bigger than a Broadway opening for a show.  What happened?  I don't know.  But at this point, I just told the guy, I go, look...  It's not like it's going to be a good day or anything today. 
[00:03:30]  I'm putting water in it.  I'm putting water.  I'm starting to put water in it now.  What is the delay?  Today is a perfect day to go swimming in your pool.  Exactly.  It's going to be, I think, mid-80s here in New York City.  Here was the problem.  When they installed the marble coat, that marble dusting coat on the gunite, which is  cement in a built-in pool.  I don't have a liner.  I have an actual old-school cement pond.  And they put that in.  Somehow, whether when they mixed it or whatever the fuck they did, it wasn't all one color. 
[00:04:00]  It looks blotchy.  And it's a new pool.  It shouldn't look blotchy.  It's supposed to be like a light gray bottom.  And there's some white spots.  And it just looks blotchy.  I don't want that.  It's a new pool.  I want it to look nice.  So we talked to the pool guy that did the installation.  And it's just been a runaround since the beginning of April when I wanted to have it open.  Started the beginning of April.  We're now coming to the end of May. 
[00:04:30]  And still, you know, what the fuck?  So yesterday, I just said, look, it's getting too close to the season.  Fill this fucking thing up.  Hook up the equipment and open it.  I go, but at the end of the season, coming back and re-fucking marble dusting it.  Boom!  That's exactly what they wanted to hear from you.  You know what, though?  I know.  You're probably right.  But I'm not going to sit here.  That's exactly what they wanted to hear.  What am I going to do?  They held out long enough knowing eventually you would be frustrated and say, just open up the pool. 
[00:05:00]  Because you're seeing the weather.  You're seeing the five-day forecast.  They win.  They win, my friend.  And then at the end of the year, guess what?  They're going to go away again.  Because you paid them all their money, too.  It's already been, you know something?  It's all paid for, right?  Yeah.  The date is already set when they have to come back and fix it.  What is marble dusting?  How long would it take them to do it?  Well, that's just it.  They can't just go in and marble dust it.  It's that, you know when you're in a built-in pool, it doesn't feel like cement the side.  It's kind of smooth and almost glittery. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Kind of that's that stuff that they spray on.  And it's like a cement, but it's called like marble dust.  It makes it look all nice.  It's supposed to anyway.  How long does it take to do like a coat?  Well, that's just it.  If you put it on the gunite itself, it doesn't take that long.  It's just a day of spraying it on.  When they have to redo it, they have to grind out where the marble dust meets the nice tiles.  Because if they didn't, it would overlap.  Like they're putting another whole layer of marble dust on this. 
[00:06:00]  So they almost got to scrape off the old marble dust.  And I don't see this happening anytime soon.  I don't have any faith of this happening.  What excuses did he give you?  Uh, it's always past the buck.  It's, oh, the guy that does the marble dust is, you know, a subcontractor.  And I've been trying to get in touch with him.  And it's just, it just...  They didn't want to do it.  Dude, it drives me fucking batty.  So they come up with excuses until you, like, get frustrated and go, all right, just open  up the pool.  I want the fucking pool open. 
[00:06:30]  That's why, that's why you always hold a little money back, my friend.  Instead of...  A little bit.  Instead of at the end of the season.  At the end of the season, then do it.  At the beginning, I want to get the fucking pool open.  That's where I'm at right now.  Good luck to you on that one.  Yeah, I know.  Uh, hold on.  Believe me, I know.  Hold on.  We got Scott, because you're avoiding, um, uh, the main topic at hand.  Scott in Iowa.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hi.  Is a half a red face?  Is that in relation to half a Hulk face?  No.  Except again, a tenning po-fah. 
[00:07:00]  Yes, I had a po-fah.  Po-fah.  What a dunce.  Voss ruled yesterday.  Oh, he certainly did.  I couldn't even relay to people the stupidity that was, was displayed.  I tried to, and I couldn't.  And his panicky Pete face, trying to fucking, like, make phone calls.  Ah!  Couldn't you change it?  I was trying to retell the whole Voss giving out his password story yesterday, and I was  laughing through it.  I had to start a couple different times.  Yeah, it's just...  I just couldn't get the story out.  It's ridiculously funny.  And then what this dummy did was... 
[00:07:30]  It's ridiculous.  So anyway, uh, the, uh, the po-fah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, uh, anyway...  So you passed down the backyard.  Yeah.  So you got a half of, half a face that's pretty red.  Yeah, I, I took the, uh, chair out, and I positioned it so, you know, the sun was pretty  much hitting me, because I, I, I, it was very nice out, but I really didn't think the  sun was beating down that much where, you know, a, uh, a wop such as myself, I'm, I'm  not very, you know, dark or anything, but, you know, I thought maybe I could take a few  sun rays. 
[00:08:00]  So I laid down, and, um, and I wound up getting a sunburn.  Show, show, show Jimmy the other part of the sunburn.  All right.  The face is, is not really that bad.  No?  The left arm is, uh, really...  You can't even call it the left arm.  ...really bad.  Part, part of the left arm.  First, yeah.  First, I'll show you where my watch went on.  Wow.  Uh, that's where my watch went on.  Now, as I, ow, ow, roll the sleeve up.  Holy shit.  Look, look at this.  It's literally from his bicep to his wrist. 
[00:08:30]  That's it.  Wow.  Holy shit.  That's it.  And only half of it.  Holy shit.  I was laying down on my back, and I was like this, and you could see how the, the, like,  my shirt was covering certain parts of it, so it's not a straight line.  It looks like, it, it looks like a disease.  I don't know what it is.  Wait, how do you, how is the left arm and the right side of your face tan?  How do you sleep?  Uh, I was like, I was like this. 
[00:09:00]  On his back?  Like that.  Oh, okay.  Kind of laying there like this.  And I must have went like this.  Yeah, his head was this side.  My head tilted it.  Sure.  And, um, yeah, when I woke up, I went, ooh, that, that doesn't look good.  And that's gonna be hard to even out.  And, of course, it's also Farmer Tan.  Yeah.  Because I had the short sleeves on, so I am a complete wreck from the sun.  You have arm aids.  I have arm aids, yes.  Does it hurt?  Uh, it itches.  It does itch. 
[00:09:30]  And shit makes you itch.  I eat it.  What?  But I, I, the worst is after you take a shower.  Like, for some reason, a shower just kind of brings those nerve endings right to the tippity  top, doesn't it?  It's little balls of whatever, like, uh, pain.  Yes.  Little pain speckles.  You don't realize that until you got a little sunburn happening.  Yeah, so, uh, that was, that was stupid of me.  There you go.  Why didn't you just give another pool company, like, like, finally just, just, just talk about 
[00:10:00]  who these people are so other people don't go through the same experience.  Because you would have to pay another pool company.  Yeah.  And these guys, and these guys didn't do the job right.  I'm, uh, I.  See, right now, these guys should be doing it for free.  Of course they should.  And they know that.  And the reason they're not, uh, you know, quickly doing it for Ant, because they, because  they'd rather go do someone else's pool where they're still bringing income in.  Yeah.  Money in.  I, I, I am teetering on it.  I mean, if things don't go exactly as they're supposed to go with opening this pool up, 
[00:10:30]  I got the hoses in there, it's filling up.  And, and by, um, I believe, uh, Saturday or something, uh, people are supposed to be over  and, and start the procedure of hooking up everything.  My birthday?  Your birthday.  Surprise party?  It's a surprise pool party.  See, surprise pool party.  Did you just, did you just give away my surprise party?  Jumping in the cement end with no water in it.  You know, it's, it's a, it's a big, it's a big, uh, birthday this year for me.  Big 4-0. 
[00:11:00]  That's right.  Yeah.  Finally.  Finally.  According to the New York Daily News.  This, huh?  No, I, I just, they never get our ages right.  I'm now officially younger than my, my, my young, younger twin brothers.  We talked about how that works up until a point.  Like when they get your age wrong and it's younger and you're just like, okay, this is good.  Until it gets to a point where people start going, he looks horrible for his age.  Then it doesn't work anymore. 
[00:11:30]  Then it doesn't work anymore.  And then you're going to kick it up a couple of years.  But I finally gave up on the whole thing.  It's ridiculous.  So true.  So, well, American Idol.  What a big story on.  We can't even front.  We used to be American Idol, uh, uh, watchers.  Yep.  Anthony actually was the one that, that turned me on to American Idol a few years back.  Yeah, it was, uh.  And I was in for a while.  And good show to get in on.  And I think I was telling Travis this morning, this was the first season I did not watch a  single episode. 
[00:12:00]  I didn't even watch the, uh, the, what are they called?  The auditions.  I didn't even watch that, which is usually fun to set up.  The wacky audition process.  Yeah.  But, uh, I knew who this Adam Lambert was because he's everywhere.  Yeah.  You know, what is he?  I guess he's a gay guy that kind of wears makeup and.  Why would you assume he's gay?  That's what everyone's saying.  Does he say he's gay?  No, it hasn't necessarily come out, but it's kind of a safe assumption based on the pictures  of him open mouth kissing men that are all over the internet. 
[00:12:30]  Well.  If you do a Google image search.  All right.  Well, uh, let me, let me explain another gentleman that we've seen kissing gentlemen.  Yeah.  The one that just talked on mic.  Sam.  Not like that.  Oh, wow.  Well, okay.  Holy fuck.  Why is he kissing so many guys?  Because he loves men.  He loves the cock, I think, huh?  He sure does.  How great is it that Sam.  Oh, God.  Look at these two emo fuckers just.  Ew, what is that?  Look at those two just wanting. 
[00:13:00]  Sam.  How great is it that Sam was able to defend his own gayness by pointing us to these pictures?  Yeah.  That he's not open mouth tongue kissing Bob Kelly.  I've never done that.  But you kissed a homeless guy.  Not like that.  Not with the tongue or anything.  Not open mouth.  There was a picture that looked like Danny kissing somebody.  Where?  Probably was.  Down and to the left.  All the way over to the second picture.  Up.  Now over one.  Yeah.  I just see a hat.  I think I saw Danny's hat. 
[00:13:30]  No.  No.  Come on.  What's wrong with you?  Look.  I think you're seeing what you want to see.  It was a thumbnail.  Yes, I was.  Rawr.  What the fuck is going on?  I didn't know there were so many pictures of men kissing other men.  Hold on.  We've got to go to Jimmy New Hampshire before we get into the American Idol thing.  Jimmy.  Jesus.  Morning, boys.  What's up, Jimmy?  Awful tanning story to help ants out.  All right.  Before I went on my honeymoon to Jamaica, I was told you should pre-tan in a tanning bed. 
[00:14:00]  Ah, you've got a good base.  My first time in, I happened to get a defective tanning bed, at which time I came out with pinstripes.  A pinstripe tan.  It was one of those with the fluorescent tubes.  Imagine how cool I looked walking on the beaches of Jamaica with pinstripes as if I wasn't white enough.  Looking stupid.  Where is the worst place to get a sunburn?  He's head of your cock with the red bell hole.  I guess for the nudists out there. 
[00:14:30]  But, I mean, for us regular...  It has to be armpits or behind the knees.  Jimmy nailed it, aunt nailed it, armpits all the way.  As a kid growing up, my grandma had a house, a wading river, right on the water.  And I would lay out in between playing wiffle ball, resting, and I would put my hands behind my head and just kind of go like this.  For three seconds, you'd probably...  It would take three seconds, right.  Next thing you know, you're walking around, you can't even put your arms down.  Because just the skin on skin would kill you. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, well, I'm noticing when I bend my elbow, it really stings in between the elbow here.  The armpit burn, you end up walking around like Ralphie's little brother from Christmas Story.  Yeah.  All right, Jimmy, thank you.  So, American Idol, Adam Lambert performs Beth.  Probably not as good as Jimmy Norton did. 
[00:15:30]  Kiss is doing American Idol last night.  How many of the original members?  Gene, Paul, and was it Tommy Thayer?  Hey, I've got to ask you something about Gene and Kiss there.  There's a beverage commercial on now.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that Gene?  Or is it a...  No, I think that's Gene.  For a cherry Dr. Pepper.  Okay.  It looked like they just got another guy to put Gene's makeup on, by the way.  Because he looks a little young to be Gene, even under the makeup. 
[00:16:00]  And he didn't sound much like Gene.  I think that's him.  But, yeah, that's definitely him, the face, now that I see it.  But in the commercial, it didn't sound like him.  Well, maybe they were doing a little of that Benjamin Button.  Yeah, maybe they're doing that, huh?  Yeah, they're doing that type of thing with film now, where they can make you look a little younger.  Look a little younger.  They digitally removed some of the fucking wrinkles.  I don't know.  Well, here's Adam Lambert from last...  Do we have to listen to this whole track?  Well, you could pause it and comment and then put it back on.  Kiss men during it?  No, no kissing.  Kiss men during it. 
[00:16:30]  Interesting thing.  Kiss.  Kiss guys.  If I hear you calling, but I can't come home right now.  Broadway rendered.  Yeah.  Me and the boys are playing.  And we just can't find the sound.  Just a few more hours  And I'll be right home to you 
[00:17:00]  I think I hear them calling  Oh Beth, what can I do?  Beth, what can I do?  All right, well, what are we going to do with this?  Bill, I hear you  Be a little more accurate  Bob, I hear you  Oh, guys  Yeah, please  You think?  I think  A good voice  Guy's got a great voice  Well, the country was swept up in Adam Lambert fever  Oh, are they? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah  I think it's called Swine Flu  But  Every song he did was  Swine Flu  It was a Broadway song  Yeah, they all sound like Broadway  Every single one  Broadway  Not many guys are going to be buying Adam Lambert's music  Nobody's going to really buy Adam Lambert's music  I mean, when you had Chris Daughtry  You're like, holy shit  I can't wait to see what he comes up with  It's going to be the fucking  You know, what's his name?  The other gay guy there  Clay Aiken  Clay Aiken  Syndrome  End up in Spam a lot  But it's going to be  This guy is going to get like 
[00:18:00]  Clay Aiken type exposure  With a lot of these women  That  The older women that like that fucking thing  That's where his fucking future is  Maybe some Broadway things  Yeah  He'll do real well  This is them announcing  The winner of American Idol  Did Adam Lambert win?  Everybody thought he was going to  He was the favorite, right?  I didn't think so  Did they open mouth kiss  To congratulate each other?  No  After the nationwide vote 
[00:18:30]  Of nearly 100 million  That's a lie, by the way  There's no way  They had the guy on  There's no way  100 million people voted  Unless you can vote multiple times  Yeah  You can  A guy in a suit came in  With an envelope  That was sealed  And said it  Oh, then it's got to be true  Oh, really, yeah  Okay  Did he open mouth kiss him?  The winner  Of American Idol  2009 is  So, what else is going on out there? 
[00:19:00]  Well  I got to tell you about  UFC  Undisputed  Apparently there goes the results  Oh, chop meat  Let's talk  Let's talk to chop meat  Chop meat  What a tool  Of course I am  You know, it's very difficult  To come up with character names  On video games  Just to set up  Dana White came in 
[00:19:30]  To show us the UFC 2009  Undisputed video game  Yeah  We got a few more copies  That we're going to give away  This morning, by the way  And you took it for a test drive  Yeah  Well, I was watching Mars play it  When we had him on the air  The other day  And, wow  It looked pretty cool  The graphics look amazing  It looked  It looked easier than  When I play fighting games  Against Danny  Which I always get my ass kicked  What game was that, Danny?  Because that was  I do believe that was  Street Fighter 4  Yeah, Street Fighter 4  And Danny knows  All the stupid fireball 
[00:20:00]  Comes out the ass moves  And shit  I'm just trying to box  And Danny's sending  Like planets at me  Oh, they've been the same moves  Since 1991  With that series  Yeah, well, I never  I never played those  Those fights  I never played fighting games  Do you do what I do  And you just push every button  As fast as possible  And hope for the best?  Button smash  Is that what it's called?  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, that's what I do  That's what I usually do  On fighting games  I don't try to  You know, come off with moves  But the good thing about  The UFC game here  Is  You do use the buttons 
[00:20:30]  You can use the buttons  And figure out  What the fuck they mean  Not like that guy  I play Danny  I'm actually trying to fight  Like a real fighter  Without using my superpowers  Because I don't know the buttons  And Danny's fucking lightning head  You should have thrown the remote down  And then said  Put up your dukes  We're fighting for real now  Yeah, come on  Fight like a man  Right  Not with some kind of  Fucking magical eye juice  That comes out  And fucking flattens me  It's part of the game, man  It's part of the game  So I was playing that 
[00:21:00]  And taking it for a test drive  And I didn't want to just  I did a couple of rounds  Where you just start it up  Pick a fighter  Pick another fighter  And go at it  And that's fun  Yeah, of course  You get to beat the crap  Out of each other  But I decided to go  Career mode  Where you have to take  A little time at first  To set your guy up  So I made a fighter  You do everything  You give him his attributes  Hairstyle  His name, obviously  Chopped meat 
[00:21:30]  And you gotta pick a name  And I just  I thought  First name Chop  Last name Meat  So he's Chopped Meat  Wow  What's the matter?  Asshole was taken?  I didn't think they'd eat that one  Ha ha ha  Alright, so you picked  The name Chopped Meat  Oh, people say  I should have picked Master  And then Poe  Ha ha ha  That's not a bad idea  But, yeah  I picked Chopped Meat  And then went through  The career thing  And I was doing really well  And then they trick you  They trick you 
[00:22:00]  I was undefeated  And I'm doing really good  They put you in this training part  So you gotta train  Build up your strengths  But that sounds boring to me  No, it wasn't boring  Because the training part  I just want to fight  Training part is just using points  That you've gotten from fights  And whatnot  And then you use  You train for strength  Speed  And endurance  You're not actually waking up  And drinking eggs  Yeah, yeah  You don't have to sit there  And work out  On a bench  And then you can get better  Yeah  And then you can get 
[00:22:30]  Different equipment  To exercise  But you never see yourself exercising  It's all about sparring  When you do that  Then you get points  The better you spar  If you knock your guys down  A few times  When you're sparring  You get more points  And you can take those points  And put them towards  Your kicking ability  Your punching ability  Your defending against  Punching or kicking  Grappling  There's a whole list of shit  That you can build up  Your strengths in  So at the beginning  You're really kind of  Just out there  Getting your ass handed to you  So I started building up  My kicking 
[00:23:00]  All I wanted to do  Was be a powerful kicker  So I could kick high in the head  Low in the  And then get my speed up  So I get a lot of kicks in  And my strength  To get real powerful  So I get in there  And I've just been  Kicking people in the head  And the sides  And knocking them out  Were you side kicking  Or karate kicking  Or were you just  Standing there  He was probably just  Forward kicking  The way you would do  To a mugger  Were you actually  Like throwing  Martial art kicks  Great side kicks  To the side  I'd go left side  Left side  Body body  Left side  Left side  And then when he'd 
[00:23:30]  Lean over  He'd actually  Kind of lean over  I'd go right side  Head  And kick him in the head  And you'd just see  The mouthpiece  Fly out blood  And then they hit  The canvas  And then you'd get on top  And hammer blow  Into their face  It's fantastic  Yeah beats standing  In a neutral corner  Waiting for them to get up  Fuck that noise  Until the ref steps in  Steps in  I'm punching him in the face  So chop me  Was doing very well  And then I had  Nine weeks  To train for a fight  And each week  Is spent doing 
[00:24:00]  Different things  To build it up  But you gotta watch  What you're doing  Is it a real nine weeks  Of course not  Oh okay  Yeah that would  Take a long time  What's a week  In video game time  A click  A click  One week  Yes  Like if I wanna work  On strength  I click on it  And then my endurance  Goes way down  So then you gotta  Take another week  Of just resting  And get your  Endurance back up  Your stamina  Because I made the mistake  Of training  Training  Training  And then my fight day  Was there  And I had like  No endurance 
[00:24:30]  Because I hadn't  Rested before the fight  So I didn't get  My ass kicked  I was against some slob  But then I had  Nine weeks to train  For this fight  I picked the opponent  He was one a little  Lower than me  I've been doing that  You know  Padding myself  With some bums  Just to get my numbers up  And then they go  Okay well we need you  In a week  Can you do this  You'll get extra points  And everything  What you get a little  Email or something  A message pops up  Yeah you get an email  From Dana White  Giving you like  An opportunity to  Yeah so we'll give you 
[00:25:00]  Extra points  We need this guy  Because of an injury  This guy dropped out  So can you step in  And fight  I'm like okay  So I hit okay  Accept  This sounds like fun  This sounds like  A lot of fun  And it's like  And here comes  Chetmeat  Against Chico Ortiz  I was like what  And you've been  Fighting for how long  I've been fighting  Bums  For a few weeks  I had six wins  Under my belt  I was 6-0  With bums  With bums  And then it's Tito  So I figure okay  I'm just gonna  Use my strategy  I'll stay away 
[00:25:30]  Stay within legs reach  And just kick him  In the side  In the head  Side head  So I got a few  Kicks in and I'm like  It's good  Even the commentators  Were going  Nice head kick  Oh great shot  To the head  On that one  And then I got it  A little too close  For a body kick  Got a little cocky  Tito grabs both  Of Chopmeat's legs  Throws him down  On the ground  On his back  And just hammer blows  To the face  Until my mouthpiece  Bloods all over the mat  And the big headed  Computer Tito 
[00:26:00]  Has his arms raised  Over my lifeless body  And that was my first loss  She had Joe Rogan  To announce one of these  Chopmeat's a savage  Beating by Chopmeat's  It was a savage beating  That I got  He hammer blows  It wasn't even a fist punch  It was the  Yeah  The hammer part of your hand  That he was slamming  Into my face  And blood is just going  All over the mat  So it was  It was quite a mess  Can you bring  Chopmeat online  This is another  That's another thing  This is an online version  Of this game obviously 
[00:26:30]  I could go to Xbox Live  And I could challenge  Other people  With Chopmeat  How great is that  And go against other people  I mean  I love the online thing  The online  Gameplay is just amazing  That's what I'm going to do  I'm going to build it up  A little more  And they're getting better  With the cheat codes  And all that right  Yeah  I know  It's very hard to cheat  I know in the Tiger Woods  Golf game  They watch it closely  And if you're a cheater  They're just knocking you  Offline  Which is nice  These guys are great 
[00:27:00]  I haven't built up  Enough of my points  Though in grappling  And getting out of  Some grapple holds  And even getting up  Off the ground  Like when I get knocked down  I'm flat on my back  And I'm just kicking my legs  Like a rabbit  Trying to get the guy  Off of me  But I don't know  How to get the fuck up  In that position  You've only been playing  One day  Yeah I've got to figure that out  And I've got to get my points up  See yeah  Those are your points  That you can allocate  Yeah there's some nice  YouTube videos  Yeah  Showing off the video game  And that's in the gym 
[00:27:30]  UFC 2009 undisputed  And then I'm trying  To figure it out  You know  So I'm a little more  I have a little more  Defense against when people  Throw me down on the ground  Sure  Instead of just  You know  Throwing my controller  On the floor  And going  Oh well I lost  That fucking fight  I never played fight games  Maybe I play this one  Never try this one  I want Anthony  To go to a UFC event  And I want them  To just kind of  Bring you in  To introduce you  Is chop me  But I want you  To be wearing  Old school wrestling attire  Like with the  Yeah like  What do they call  A singlet  A singlet 
[00:28:00]  A singlet  Yeah that's the name  With just a big hog  In the front  Because anyone  Wearing a singlet  Looks like they have  A giant hog  Because it pushes  Everything off  Oh all your balls  Are just hanging there  It makes you look like  You're just all bag  All bag  Look at you  Danny found a picture  Of a singlet  Ah  Jesus  Look at the guy  His big hog  And a singlet  Oh fuck  Ah Danny  Danny finds the hottest  Pictures  I hope yours  Is the first  The first character  In this game  That the other fighters  Figure out a way  To rape and beat  Like outside the ring 
[00:28:30]  Leave chop meat alone  He had a tough night  Last night  Chop meat's a queer  Tito  Didn't know Tito  Was going to get a hold of him  What kind of shitty management  Does chop meat have  That he just sends you in  Against somebody  And says well  Whoever shows up  Will fight  I  No it was up to him  Dana sent me an email  And I was like  You know something  I'll accept this  I think I'm doing pretty good  I've been knocking  Everybody out  And they taught me a lesson  So I went back  To a couple of slobs  I'm ranked  I'm ranked 
[00:29:00]  450th out of 8  Yes  I got my ranking down  From 22nd to 10th  So I'm ranked 10th  And  I'm getting there  And Joe Logan  Is the announcer  In the game  UFC  Oh in the game too  Yeah I'm sure  Yeah it's a good  Let's say hi to Mike  In Florida  Mikey  Hey guys  What's up  Hey man  There's a training mode  On that game  That you can actually  Spend close to a couple  Hours going through  All the different ways  You can get up  You can send submissions 
[00:29:30]  Do submissions  Yeah I just figured  I'm jumping right in  So  That's what I did  I was surprised  I actually made a  Career mode character  Because that usually  It takes a little while  Of picking the person  And you know  Hairstyles  Tattoos  I tattooed  I tattooed  The hell out of the guy  To make him look all nasty  Can you write what you want on it  Within reason  You can import  Certain graphics  Oh wow  Yeah if you want to make  Tattoos  You should be a black guy  No  In Tiger Woods  I'm a black guy 
[00:30:00]  And when I play guys online  I've said this a few times  But the racist comments  Now I understand how it is  To live like a black man  I get really mad  I get mad at the comments  No no  I'm a white guy  Of my black character online  Chopped meat is a white guy  But let me tell you  Something interesting  Yeah  You go into these fights  Especially when you're undefeated  At the beginning  You go into them  And it's after the training part  And you really want to win  You know  It's like  Alright  I'm hitting the button  Fight's going to start  And then you know  Michael Buffer's son there 
[00:30:30]  Comes in  And announces the whole thing  And you see the octagon  It's really cool  And you get psyched up for it  You know  And you want to win the fight  So I was kicking ass  And I actually got  The first black guy  That came in  And they're all just  Computer people  Doesn't matter the color  Of the texturing  Over the character  It's their attributes  And whether you can  Beat them or not  Please tell me  You got intimidated  I got all intimidated  At the first black guy  I had to fight 
[00:31:00]  Because I'm like  Why?  He thought he was moving  In the store to you  What's wrong with you?  But I was just like  Oh this guy's going to  Kick my ass  Because he looked  All intimidating and shit  So he came in there  But you know  I kicked his ass  I showed him  Who was balls  You know what's weird  About video games  I don't think  Women in general  Because I'm sure  There's a few out there  Yeah  They don't understand  Like guys in their video games  Like if you ever play  A video game with a girl  They're into it like  Oh wow  They'll play for like  Five or ten minutes  And they're like  Alright what do you  Want to do next? 
[00:31:30]  It's like what?  We got eight hours to go  Yeah  What's wrong with you?  You don't play a video game  For ten minutes  Yeah  This is like  You invest  A weekend  Yeah  My friend  And they don't care  If they win or lose  I'm yelling  And throwing my remote down  Because I'm fucking up  My stats  I was twittering  A couple of things  Last night about the game  That I was playing it  And how good it is  It's really  It's a good game  And I said  I was on career mode  And somebody answered me back 
[00:32:00]  And said  They go  Oh great  They go  You know what you do  When you're in career mode?  Because it's fighting  And training  To get more points  And fighting  Training  Almost like leveling up  It's chicken egg  You don't know where to stop  Yeah  So  He goes  You'll be here at midnight  Going  One more  One more fight  Just one more fight  And that's exactly what I was doing  I'm like  One more  One more  Because then you train  And then you're like  What am I going to  Stop the game  Now that I'm ready for a fight  Or then you fight 
[00:32:30]  And you go  Well I want to train now  So I can get my points up  And get my  Like stats up  So I wound up fighting  And then  See  Going to bed  After a fight  But  That's why you don't hear me  Talking about video games that much  Because  I definitely have OCD  I have it under control  For the most part  Except for video games  For the most part  But for  When it comes to video games  It's  I feel the click in my  My brain  That just keeps clicking  Click click  I can't get out of it  It's a cycle  And I'm like  I'm going to be stuck here  For 
[00:33:00]  You know  A day  And time does not go quicker  Than when you're playing  A video game  Right  Oh yeah  I think waterboarding time  Goes quicker  Than when you're playing a game  It's like  I was looking at my watch  And I go  Okay it's 9.30  I'll just zip around  And do a few things  Oh hey it's 12.30  Oh yeah  I'm just going to  What the fuck happened  When Tiger Woods  First came out  The one for the PS3  That I absolutely love  And I can't wait for the new one  And someone better tell me  When that game comes out  I think it's in June  I wake up early on the weekends 
[00:33:30]  Because of our schedule  Sun's barely up  Having coffee  Next thing I know  And I don't even know  How it happened  You're teeing off  I'm watching the sun  Set behind me  Yeah  Whole day  Yeah  Have you spent the whole day  Playing that game  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  I mean when I say  The sun's setting behind me  Now you know  Time frame  Winter  When it sets at 3 in the afternoon  So it wasn't that bad  But still  It was probably  Nine hours  Sure  Oh yeah  That's why I don't play  EverQuest 
[00:34:00]  Well I'm dating myself  But those type of games  World of Warcraft  Things like that  Those games  For someone that has OCD  Is a complete  And utter nightmare  June 8  There's no way  You'll ever live your life  June 8th  Tiger Woods 2010  Holy shit  Can I get an advanced copy  Coming up  June 8th  How many days  Ten  A little over two weeks  What  Yeah  Three weeks from yesterday  Three weeks  Travis is just as excited as you are  You're done  I wish you could combine those games  And Chopmeet could beat the shit out of the golfer  Chopmeet just comes rolling and kicking the golfer 
[00:34:30]  In the side of the head  Breaking the clubs over their heads  I'm a one trick pony though  I am just a head kicking  Side kicking ass  I'll take a fucking wedge to Chopmeet  And see what he can do with that  Chopmeet rules  Can you fight above weight class  A little bit  Yeah  Can you fight like Mirko Krokop  Who's a kicker  You ought to fight Krokop  I want to see your kicking skills tested  I don't think Chopmeet would do very good  Against Krokop  At this point in his career  I could probably step up  A weight class 
[00:35:00]  In time  You build yourself up  Can you fight like at your weight  Can you fight a lightweight  Against a heavyweight  No I don't think I could do that  In career mode  I think it's pretty accurate  As far as that's concerned  Let's go to Marcos in Yonkers  Marcos  Good evening  Marcos  Hey what's up boys  What's up man  Jimmy  Hey  Hey I was gonna say  You know how I know  A game is good  A game is good  When my eyes start burning  You know  I play it  I'm playing it  And I know what it's after a while  Like oh shit  I forgot to blink 
[00:35:30]  For like 20 minutes  Dude I woke up  With fucking game hangover  This morning  And I haven't had game hangover  In a long time  That's the worst  Because I haven't had a game  That I've really played  It's all in your eyes  You get this  You get like a pain in your eyes  And when you move them around  They're bloodshot  And you see like  How about  Blurry  How about the eyelid flutter  That lasts for like three days  Because you're just staring at a screen  And you're just moving your eyes  If you looked  If you tracked your eyes  During a video game  It's probably more than when you're driving 
[00:36:00]  I mean  You know  You're constantly looking at your character  And what you gotta do  And your eyes are just  Jetting back and forth  What about the arthritis hands  Yeah that's another thing  The thumbs  Where you're like  You can't  Ugh  Alright  Yeah  Why don't we take a quick break  Good game though man  UFC  2009  Undisputed  Yeah why don't we give a couple out  Are we mailing these things  Yeah  We are  Yeah  The phone number is on your pad date I guess  Right

[00:37:00]  Then they get their Xbox  If eight PlayStation guys call  Perfect  Call now  We're going to take a quick break  What haven't we played in a while  Have we played the  The Ben Stiller walks  In on O&A  Watching porn  Travis  Yeah you can do that  Thumbs up from Travis  He's keeping track of a lot of that  Doing a good job with that  Alright we'll play this for you  Ben Stiller came in to  Promote his movie that starts tomorrow  I guess right  Night at the museum  The Smithsonian or whatever  Right  And we were like fucking around  Watching porn  And no one told us that he was 
[00:37:30]  Walking in our studio  He didn't mind  But it was  It was kind of  A little awkward  A little moment  Yeah  Funker  Uh huh  Funker  Looks like Vince McMahon lost  What happened  Wow  Where's Sam  My god  Remember the whole Denver Nuggets  Let me just  Enjoy Sam running down the hallway  Look at those ridiculous feet  It's a horrible run 
[00:38:00]  Duck  It's a duck running down the hall  Sam last we left it  Uh Vince McMahon was in a fight  With the Denver Nuggets  Owner or the uh  The owner of the arena  Yeah  What's his name again  Uh  Kroenke  Kroenke  Right right right right  What's the deal for the people  That didn't hear us talking about this  Well basically  He booked  The Pepsi arena  I think that's what it's called  For Raw  But then  The Denver Nuggets  Made the playoffs  So they need the arena  For the playoff game  But there was nothing 
[00:38:30]  In the contract  That said  They could have it back  If they needed it  So Vince McMahon  Is trying to get them  To honor their contract  And say no  I'm having Raw there  Right  And they want to have  Their little playoff game  And the last we knew  Vince was like  Well I guess  Just give me two events  On that night  Right  Two events  What do you say  The trucks are rolling  Toward Denver as I speak  Yes  Right  The trucks were rolling  He said  Well guess what  Vince lost  Uh huh  He didn't lose  Uh huh  He didn't lose  What do you have to say  About that Sam 
[00:39:00]  Well he didn't lose  It's like the Denver Nuggets  Will be playing  And not Raw  Yes  Sam comment  Well I'll tell you this  I'm sure the people  Of Denver  Are up in arms  Oh really  Yes  They'd much rather  Have seen Vince  And Raw  Of course  Plus  This Cronky guy  I was listening  To Vince McMahon  And he is one of  The worst businessmen  Of all time  Well that's what  Vince said  He said that  They threw the WWE  Out on their ear  They threw him out  On the street  Wow  On their ear 
[00:39:30]  Because there's  Thousands of these  Wrestling fans  In Denver  Who bought tickets  To Raw  Uh huh  And now  They're just useless  Pieces of paper  They don't get to see  Any wrestling action  Actually it's a  Collector's item  I think  It's the show  That never happened  That they have tickets for  Put them up on eBay  Here's the latest  Vince  A VP with Cronky Sports  Has said that  They were working with you  To quote  Resolve this situation  Amicably  What have they said  To you Vince  These people are 
[00:40:00]  The worst business  People in the world  I don't know  What amicable means  When uh  And that's  They wouldn't even  Talk a deal  Unless there was  A joint press release  Uh in which  Uh I was basically  Uh kissing Cronky's  Behind  You will not believe  We're going to have  A press conference  Tomorrow  At 1 o'clock  People kiss my ass  I'm going to show you  Some of the things  That they wanted me to do  It's preposterous  It's the most  Ridiculous  Proposal  Uh maybe in  Sports entertainment  History  He's going to have  A press conference  In New York 
[00:40:30]  Apparently he's having  A press conference  At 1 o'clock today  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  I got to comment  On what Vince  Just said there  Yeah  One of the most  Ridiculous comments  Or he used another word  It wasn't comments  Was it  Proposal  Proposals  In sports entertainment  History  Yes  There have been  Proposals  That have been  A little more  Ridiculous  Than I'm sure  What this gentleman  Brought up  In sports entertainment  Not in sports entertainment  Oh I believe so  I think it started out 
[00:41:00]  As a proposal  When they decided  To have  What's her name  Give birth to a hand  Yeah  To a hand  That would be a  Sports entertainment  Proposal  Yeah a proposal  We propose that we do this  Or like when  The Big Show's father  Died of cancer  And the Big Boss man  Came to his funeral  And then attacked  The Big Show  And then chained up  The casket to his police car  And started dragging it  Around the cemetery  See that's  That's a little more  Outrageous and preposterous  Than I'm sure  Whatever this gentleman  Came up with 
[00:41:30]  I don't know  This cranky guy  Is not to be trusted  No  No  Is this a work  No  Is Vince gonna like  Clothesline him  At the meeting  But here  Vince McMahon is the best  At turning these things  Into wrestling angles  Yeah he is  Because he's  All over the news now  Because he's just  Sitting there  Usually something like  This would happen  Maybe in like a meeting  Or behind closed doors  And they'd reach  Instead Vince McMahon  Is just smashing him  On live television  Everywhere he can  Is he gonna meet  With this gentleman's  Negotiating team 
[00:42:00]  Who suspiciously  Will be looking like  Big wrestlers in suits  Hopefully it'll happen  Live on Monday night  Live  Bring the cameras in  And there'll be  A big brawl  In the meeting room  In the conference room  I bet Vince wins  Someone will go through  The big conference table  Oh my god  Let me hear  The end of that clip again  You will not believe  We're gonna have a press conference  Tomorrow at 1 o'clock  At the Hard Rock Cafe  In New York  I'm gonna show you  Some of the things  That they wanted me to do  It's preposterous 
[00:42:30]  It's the most ridiculous  Proposal  Maybe in sports  Entertainment history  Wow  Will you be going  To this press conference  Well I'm a pretty  Esteemed member  Of the press  So I would hope  I can get my ass down  It would be nice  To have you down there  With the recorder  And maybe get a couple  Of questions in  Maybe get a little  One on one action  Maybe a little  One on one  Dare to dream  My friend  Basically you're saying  You're gonna call  Hard Rock Johnny up  And ask if you can  Bust tables or something  So you get a peek  At the press conference 
[00:43:00]  I get to go  To press conferences  Prime time  Should be allowed  All access  Alright where's  Your media badge  I don't need  A media badge  I'm a known person  Yes he's prime time  Sam Roberts  Is he  And uh  I'm a broadcast journalist  And then you'll be able  To get the news  Before anyone else does  You'll know what's happening  And guess where  Guess who else will have it  The Opie and Anthony show  Oh wow  Look at that  That's where his dedication lies  I like this kid  Only 20 hours  After the rest of the world  Hears it  From the Hard Rock 
[00:43:30]  Press conference  Wow great Sam  So what are your plans  For Monday night  Well it's real simple  We will be  Leaving Denver  Because we're forced out  By Cronkies organization  And unfortunately  We'll be leaving Denver  And uh  Fortunately  We will be going to  Los Angeles  Home of the Lakers  And uh  At the Staples Center  And it should be  An extraordinary event  As a matter of fact  I envision  The WB's  Um  Well our form of the Lakers  Versus the  WB's form of 
[00:44:00]  Uh  Of the Nuggets  It should be  A very interesting night  5-1-5  Mr. McMahon  Is going to be there  To compete  Or at least confront  Mr. Stan Kroenke  So we're going to have  A lot of fun  This Monday night  When we emanate  From the Staples Center  In Los Angeles  What is he doing?  What is he doing?  Well first of all  He's having Raw  From the Lakers arena  Since the Nuggets  Won't let him have it there  That showed him  So he goes to the rival team  Then  Well  Because there's not a lot  Of sports  NBA fans in this room  Of course the Lakers  Playing the Nuggets  So now to move it to LA 
[00:44:30]  There's a big rivalry  And what is Vince  Going to come out  In a Lakers jersey  And then beat up  A fake  Fake  Conkey  Who's in a Nuggets jersey  I heard  Well they're going to have  Obviously the WWE's  Form of the Lakers  And Nuggets  But he said  Mr. McMahon  Would be there  To confront Kroenke  Live on Raw  Maybe Kroenke  And what was that number  He said  Five on five  No five on five  Or something  No five on five  Oh five on five  What's that  I guess two teams of five  Oh because basketball 
[00:45:00]  And then he said  Mr. McMahon  Right  Why would he say that  Because he's Mr. McMahon  No no no no  The person on that  News broadcast  Was Vince McMahon  Chairman of World Wrestling  Entertainment  Yes  The person you see  On Monday Night Raw  Is Mr. McMahon  That's Mr. McMahon  So he calls him  A different  Oh it's like  Anthony Cumia  Right  But when I fight  In UFC  I'm chop meat  Right  It's like  Yes  Yes  Oh I get it now  Completely  It's like when you're  Vince is out of his mind 
[00:45:30]  When you're on Fox Red Eye  Yes  You're Anthony Cumia  But when you're here  In this studio  You're Anthony  You know what I mean  It's like a character  Well I think I'm still  Anthony  On Red Eye too  But it's a different character  Maybe on Hannity  Hannity you're Anthony  Then I'm Anthony Cumia  But here you're  Anthony  Yeah  So what is he doing  He's gonna  I'm not Miss  I never refer to myself  That was Mr. Cumia  Maybe it's a new character  He developed  Oh that's great  Mr. Roberts  We shouldn't question 
[00:46:00]  Vince McMahon  Because now  I haven't watched wrestling  In months  I'm gonna have to watch  No I gotta  You know  I'm gonna have to tune in  And see what he does  He's pretty smart  Yeah  With how he markets  This damn thing  We were thrown out  Thrown out of Denver  Colorado  But we're here in Los Angeles  And we're gonna kick some  Nuggets ass hard  That's right  They've got no chance  Against the Lakers  We were thrown unceremoniously 
[00:46:30]  Thrown out of Denver  And knowing Vince McMahon  The Lakers are all gonna be like  You know  Monsters  And then he's gonna bring out  The Nuggets  And they're gonna be like  Midgets  Pajeria kids  Or midgets  Or something  And tiny little nuggets  Look at them  Don't they look ridiculous  Look at them  They look ridiculous  They'll be yelling  They'll be all fat  And out of shape  That would be pretty funny though  Of course that's what he's doing  And Vince will be looking at them 
[00:47:00]  Like oh boy  Shaking his head  What are these guys doing here  They don't even deserve to do it  They're on the same court  With the Lakers  The LA fans will probably like that  Yeah  Yeah  How many of you  Love our Nuggets fans  Boo  That's right  Not a lot of  He's not even gonna do that  He's just gonna walk out  With a Lakers jersey on  Where's Mr. McMahon  Where's Mr. McMahon  Bring him  Oh I'm him  Alright 
[00:47:30]  Well there you go  Vince is always in it there  Sam  Go to the press conference  And get something done  He's gonna stick it to him  How about he comes in here  He's in New York  Sticking it to him you think  Come on by and say hi  And we'll help you  Promote this dumb thing  He's very busy  This stupid wrestling thing  It's not stupid  Speaking of basketball  He's gotta defend  Big upset last night  Game one of the  Eastern Conference Finals  What happened  Cavs heavily favored there  Anthony  A lot of people saying  That it's destiny  That the Cavs  And the Lakers  Play in the NBA Finals  You got LeBron James  Against Kobe Bryant 
[00:48:00]  But  Yeah  You know  Maybe the Cavs  Are looking past the magic  A little too much right now  What kind of magic  Do they have  The magic  Yeah what are you talking  No no  You said the Cavs  Are looking ahead to the magic  What kind of magic  Well they what  What happened  They have  The Cavs have some kind of magic  No the magic beat the Cavs  Orlando  Magic  Oh it's a team  Yeah  Oh okay  That makes much more sense  I thought there was some kind of magic involved  I was frightened  You do know that right  Yeah I knew 
[00:48:30]  I knew there was a team called magic  I don't know if you do though  I think I know like the names  See  See the Cavs heavily favored  They're playing at home  And the magic beat them in game one  So  Yeah  They gotta wake the fuck up  If they're supposed to play the Lakers  And Kobe Bryant  LeBron did his job though  He had 49 points last night  What does this have to do with the Red Hot Yankees winning eight now  Did they really  Yeah  What's that about  A-Rod's return  Boy  A-Rod actually  Been doing pretty good  A-Rod with the A-bomb  But yeah 
[00:49:00]  They've been  They've been doing a good job  The pitching's been there  They've been  They've been  Winning games  They sucked ass  And then what happens  The Mets are falling apart  Yeah the Mets are  A little shaky right now  Cause they were doing really well  When the Yankees were sucking ass  When do we get to  Check out these new stadiums  I know  Come on  Big celebrities like we are  And we haven't had one offer yet  I know  I was asked if I  Saw the new stadium yet  And I was embarrassed  I said no  I haven't been there  Yeah  And then I made an excuse like  Well the prices  I do want to check out those stadiums badly 
[00:49:30]  Yeah  It almost seems like a lot of fun  And I hear there's  Drinking back in the bleachers  The bleacher creatures  Remember that  Of course  Yeah  They were trying to shut them down  Well they shut them down  At the old Yankee Stadium  If you remember  But now apparently  For revenue  You know  The cost of seating  The area  Everything like that  So they entice  They entice you  With beer  So you're allowed to drink there again 
[00:50:00]  Which is one of those things  I was talking about  But I thought they were worried  That we were drinking too much  Well that is the problem  Until you need the money  Until you need the money  And they're like  You know  Fuck you and your liver  Drink  I don't care if you're  As much as you can  Please  Slamming into children  In the parking lot  Whatever it is  Just drink  Always comes down  The almighty dollar  But that was one of those situations  Where it was like  Wow once they take that away  It's very hard to bring that back again  But they got it back  It's money  That's crazy  Because of money things  And then I was thinking  That doesn't work still  With bottomless dancers  On Long Island 
[00:50:30]  You can't use that  You can't use that as like  We gotta save the strip clubs  So let's bring bottomless dancing  Back to Long Island  What we gotta do  Is talk to a politician  That is on his way out  About to retire  Yo look  Why don't you take care of all of us  Before you leave  You pick up the fucking ball  On this one  And run with it  Right  You  You're gonna go down in history  My friend  Yeah  The last thing you do  Before you go and retire  Is you bring back  Topless  Bottomless  Dancing on Long Island  I hold out hope  On that one  Can you have that  With no alcohol 
[00:51:00]  I don't know  About Long Island  In a juice bar you can  I know in New York  Or something  Or some cities  I am not sure  At all  What you can do  And let's be honest  Whether there's booze or not  Some of these strip clubs  In Long Island  Do you really want to see  The bottom  Yeah  I love freak shows like that  I like the cesarean scars  And gunshot wounds  Gunshot wounds  And all that  Some of the bottoms  On these  These day strippers  Are a little rough  Fucking  A little fucking rough  Melted Swiss 
[00:51:30]  Hanging out from  Should we get Kenny in here  For the  Club Soda Kenny  Country radio demo  We never got to this  Yesterday did we  Well cause Dice came in  Did he  I didn't notice  You sort of did it  Holy shit  Yeah  You phased out  You're like  You don't want it  I gave it my best shot  But it reached the point  Where I was like  I can't  I wanted to kind of  Rich Voss was in here  Yesterday  For anybody that 
[00:52:00]  Didn't hear the show  Boy did he kill  Boy did you miss a Lulu  Probably the best bit  Of the week  Yeah  I think we're going to  Start counting down  Best bits of the week  On the weekends  By the way  Yeah yeah  Cause that was  To make it a little  More interesting  You know  The material that  We give you  It was insanity  How stupid  Rich was yesterday  For how stupid  He is on every  Appearance he makes  On the show  He was so stupid  Yesterday  And it was  It was great  He was funny  Dumb  Jimmy just  Couldn't be  Have been faster 
[00:52:30]  On lines that  Were bashing him  It was a lot  Of fun  And then  And then  Dice came in  And you know  I don't have a  Problem with Dice  With the man Dice  With Andrew Dice Clay  Now Mr. Clay  As he calls himself  When he's the Dice  Character  I'm Mr. Clay  I can't  Then talk  Like Bonnie came in  With the  With the  The little baby  And I wanted to 
[00:53:00]  Ask Bonnie a lot  Of things about  Rich  And their relationship  And I'm sure  It would have been  Funny  Bonnie's very funny  When she bashes  Rich  But it was like  Hey Bonnie  So what is this  With the kissing  And not kissing  And the sex life  How are things  Between you guys  Well you know  Things have changed  What do you mean  Why do you get  Personal  That there's a baby  Here  I'm like  Alright  Rich  You know  Does Bonnie know  That you gave out 
[00:53:30]  Your passwords  And is it going to  To affect her  In any way  Well  I got on the phone  And hopefully  Wait  You did what  He did  Who do what  Did you make  You're going to  Get your personnel  My kids bed  So I was just like  At one point  I just kind of  I tipped the mic  Away a little bit  And just started  Typing to people  I was just  Typing to people  Going  I'll do a show  For the people  On the chat board  Because I couldn't  Get really 
[00:54:00]  Anything going  With Dice in here  It's very difficult  To get something  Going  When Dice is in here  Except for  Dice  Dice wants it to be  All about Dice  When he's in here  Exactly  Jesus  That's all  So it took me  Out of the mix  A little bit  I was a little frustrated  Toward the end of the show  And we were supposed  To do the  Country demo  For Kenya  Country demo  That would know  And you knew  You even knew 
[00:54:30]  You know what  I know you knew  I know you knew  Because we were  Going to do that  And you were like  I'm holding this  Fucker back  Because it's not  Going to get  Three seconds into it  Before it's like  No  What country  Elvis sang country  Do me  Yeah  Do me  So  All right  Well we got  I don't think  We have any guests today  Oh Lydia's here  What

[00:59:30]  Regular Radio  We were really happy  That we were losing Lydia  But she decided to  To buy the Sirius XM  So she continues to be  A listener  Of this radio show  Yeah  And here she is  Lydia  There comes Lydia  Actually  She psychoanalyzes us a lot  Yeah  Hi Lydia  Hi guys  Hello  I hate that voice  Do you  Yeah  She's smiling  Yes  Lydia is sexy  You know what  Lydia is sexy  You know what  I gotta take  Lydia I'll be honest

[01:00:30]  We're all not too short  To say Lydia  Because she looks good  Yeah  I was hoping you'd be a mess  I was shooting  Not a mess today  No you look good  Yeah  Where are you originally from?  I'm from Brooklyn  From Brooklyn  Okay so it's not that long  A haul in here  Aside from the traffic  But I came from Oceanside  Yeah she's a Long Island  Long Island  Housewife now  And are you a complete  What are you  A shrink  A  I have my PhD  In clinical psychology  So  Is that what you do 
[01:01:00]  For a living?  Yes  You have your own  I work as a school psychologist  Oh school psychologist  I work as a school psychologist  What school?  What grades?  I work district wide  And I prefer not to say  The school district  Oh well I wouldn't ask  For the school district  I'm just like  What age  Children do you work with?  I started with high school  Uncle Paul  Yeah  And I'm working  In a middle school now  As well as an elementary school  Okay  So I work all ages  What are the biggest problems  In middle school  That kids are coming to you with 
[01:01:30]  These days?  It's all about sex  All about sex  And what's their problems?  Oh the problems are  They want to have it  Yeah  No one's giving it to them  This is great  I need this job  I need Lydia's job  It'd be like  Okay  How old are the kids again?  Oh let's see  Middle school  Starts around 11  And goes to about 13, 14  Jeez  Do you ever get turned on  By their stories?  No  Come on  Not in middle school  Not at all  Maybe the high school  I don't understand the age thing  But just like  Like hearing people 
[01:02:00]  Or kids talk about sex  They tell you stories about  You know  What they've done  Maybe  Little things  Maybe the high school  As the middle school kids  Do not have it going on  No  Absolutely not  They just  Yeah  They're just little creeps  With raging hormones  Exactly  It's not sexy  It's just like  Now what do you tell them?  They say like  Oh  Miss Lydia  I don't know what they call you  Doctor  Doctor  Dr. Lid  Dr. Lid  Dr. Lid  I want to have sex 
[01:02:30]  I'm getting these urges  What do I do?  You know  That's a tough one  Because of course  The school district  Doesn't want me to tell them  To go out and have sex  Right  So what do you  Preach abstinence?  Absolutely not  I tell them to be safe  I tell them  Just throw them a rubber  And  Send them other way  Send them home  What's most important  Is not to do anything  That's going to kill you  Oh really?  Do you talk to them 
[01:03:00]  With the cleavage hanging out  Like you are now?  Oh no  They're shirts for you guys  When I go home  I think I'll change the shirt  But keep the suit  Yeah  Lydia's got great legs  Like really sexy  I would not be able  To talk to her  As a psychologist  Or psychiatrist  A psychologist  When I was  If I was in high school  I would just be staring  Yeah  I bet a lot of the boys  Like you  Like you know  They probably  Young boys come in  And go yeah  What about Miss Lid?  Dr. Lid?  It was actually funny 
[01:03:30]  Because yesterday  I was running some meetings  And I ran into someone  Who remembered me  Previously  Who I of course  Didn't remember  And he was all  Blushing and red  And everyone was teasing me  Someone had a crush on me  Oh  That's cute  And then he remembered  Probably the things  He told you  You know  But how he had  The tiniest penis  In the school  Do you ever have people  Tell you really  Humiliating things?  Yes  Yeah  Do you ever laugh at them?  No  Tell me it's their fault  Do you want to sometimes?  Yes  Do you bite your tongue?  I laugh later  You should laugh right in their face 
[01:04:00]  It's fun  How do you resist?  Oh it's my job  It's my job not to laugh  But that makes it  Sometimes when you can't laugh  Yeah  It makes it  You know when I almost laughed  When Duff McKagan's band was playing  They were very good  And I was enjoying them  But I just kept thinking of the Homer Boo clip  Oh God  And it didn't belong there  It wasn't about them not being good  Right  It was just  It would have been so inappropriate  So awkward  And destroying the moment  And I was just hiding behind the mic 
[01:04:30]  And I didn't mean to  Like thank God I wasn't in that little video  Yeah  And I was just laughing  Because I was like  How awful would that be?  Yeah  What is with that Dr. Lidd?  We talked about this many times on the air  When you have these thoughts of doing  Horrific things  Not horrific in a way of  You know murder or anything like that  But just very inappropriate  Embarrassing things  Like standing up in the middle of a church  During a funeral  And blindsiding the casket 
[01:05:00]  As for a laugh  You know  Why do you get those thoughts?  Everyone gets those uncontrollable urges  And I think the trick is to remember  That it's sort of normal  And the abnormal part is to act on them  To act on it  Right  But like  What if you get right to the brink in your head  Where you're like  I could do that right now  Yeah  Is that a little odd?  But you didn't act on it  So  But you didn't act on it  So does it matter  If it's just a fleeting thought 
[01:05:30]  Where you're like  Oh my God  That's awful  Get that out of my head  Or if it's like  I actually have the power to do that  Right this second  And maybe your ass gets off the pew  For a second  I gotta look at who that's coming from  Coming from you Anthony  I don't know  You are probably the person on this team  That I'm most worried about  Worried?  Oh why?  Now why psychologically  Are you worried a little bit about me?  I really do worry about you  And I mean that seriously  Seriously  Not a joke  Jimmy's in treatment  So I don't worry about him as much 
[01:06:00]  Yes I'm doing well  What seems to be the  I'll be sort of  Represents the more  Lost cause?  I think he's trying to lead  A somewhat normal life  Despite his celebrity  And I don't know  How that all happened for him  I'm talking to somebody  I'm happy to hear that  That's wonderful  That's great  A drug dealer  Yes  An invisible friend  They're on the couch with him 
[01:06:30]  They're next to him right now  Yeah I heard you're  Working on your new drug dealer  I'm worried about you Anthony  And me  Because of your isolation  It's not so much  The drinking  And the guns  Although those  All sort of fit into it  Drinking and guns  In isolation  Are dangerous  Anti-government stance  And military garb  Yes I'm all shimmied out  Today by the way  I worry about you  Shutting yourself off  From people who care for you  Hmm  Let me think about that  For a second 
[01:07:00]  I do go to  You don't call anyone back  I don't call anyone  Ever  Ever  I text a lot  But I never called  And I go to  Many of the family  All the family functions  Where I sit  And enjoy the time  Spent with my loved ones  I just don't want to  Hang out with them  You know  All the time  I enjoy doing things  Like going home  Enjoying my  Plush surroundings  Playing video games  Broadcasting  Just hanging out  In the theater 
[01:07:30]  Watching a good movie  Why does that  Have to be a problem  Dr. Lidd  You have set up  A really great  Retreat for yourself  Yes  I hate people  See that's the problem  Dr. Lidd  I don't like people  Anytime I have to  Deal with people  Except for people  That I interact with  On a daily basis  I like them  And it's  You know  But people in general  When I go into a store  Let's say  I have no patience  For people that are 
[01:08:00]  At the counter  Where it should take  Two seconds  And they're sitting there  And I'm just like  But everyone's like that  Bitch  See  Everyone's like that  Driving  I'm not as bad  With the road rage  As I used to be  I used to be horrific  With road rage  I'd yell  I'd hit the thing  But it's still in there  So when somebody  Pulls a stupid move  I go  I gotta look  And see what this is  And then I look out  The window  And I go  Ah that figures  That stereotype  Isn't going away  Anytime soon  So I just  I rarely find things  In people I don't know 
[01:08:30]  And go  Wow that's admirable  It's usually  Wow that's a piece of shit  I don't like people  But what do you do  For intimacy?  Ah that's in my house  Yeah  Duct tape  A little lump hammer  Chloroform  Chloroform  And gets a kiss  On the cheek  While he's watching  Hitler videos  Yeah  Wow  That's warmth  Holy Jesus  That actually happened  Of course it did  Is this turning into  Is this  Is this turning into 
[01:09:00]  An intervention for Anthony  No absolutely not  Bring in Anthony's mom  Oh here it comes  Yeah  Then it'll turn into  An intervention for her  Absolutely not  That was not my intention  Come on  Let's get into something here  I really think  You should have taken  My advice about  The whole J-Date thing  You would have had your pool  Taken care of  Nice Jewish girl  Would have been on the phone  With those pool people  Getting that gun  I'd spray it in  Rubbed out  Keep the cop  Is better than a Jewish girl  Tell you the truth  And he still sucks dick  Which I hear  Cheezing of course 
[01:09:30]  He takes it in the ass  I'm not a fan of the Jewish broad  Never have been  No  Dated Jewish broads  Yeah  They're a nightmare  Really?  Oh my god  They do have a  They do have a bad rap  They're way too close  To their mothers  Their mothers are controlling  Families are always  Mothers don't even want  To acknowledge you  Because you're not a Jew  This whole thing happens  On Long Island  Right?  You bring somebody  With you today?  Yeah I brought my husband  Is he Jewish?  Is he a Gentile?  Yeah  See?  Would you  Your mom wouldn't have 
[01:10:00]  Allowed you to marry  A non-Jew right?  For the most part?  My mom and I  Didn't have that kind  Of relationship  Uh oh  What happened with your mom?  Must have been  A bad relationship  Yeah wow  My mom and I  Had a very difficult relationship  Pot calling the kettle black  I guess  Now was it  Looks like the psychologist  Has the worst problems  In the room  That's right  Probably true  She's blinking rapidly  She's grinding her hands  Like Humphrey Bogart  At the end of the community  Yeah  Strawberries  How many portions 
[01:10:30]  Did you have mom?  What was up  Yeah  They called her  Old yellow nipples  Oh god  So what  What was up with your mom  And you?  Uh my mom was a difficult person  To live with  Yelling  Screaming  She's a drinker  Controlling  She's a big drinker  Lydia's a big ACOA  Big adult child of an alcoholic  And uh  That's probably why  She went into psychology  You want to fix other people  You want to fix those things  Which were unfixable at home  Ah see  See we're getting it to your head  That does make sense  Getting it to your head now 
[01:11:00]  You're welcome  I always feel like  I have to save the world  Really?  Yeah I got this whole thing  Where I gotta you know  You?  Yeah  Yeah  When are you gonna start?  Yeah I've never seen evidence  His idea of saving the world  Is wiping out the bad elements  Yes exactly  No I'm kind of a  One person at a time  Try to save  You know the world  Kind of a thing  One person at a time  Not even charity work  Well I kind of  He sees a story  That makes him sad  And then he takes care  Of the problem immediately  I think for the most part 
[01:11:30]  I find myself attracted  To um  Oh  People that are  Maybe a little lost  I can believe that  Yeah  And uh  You know  It's kind of like  Um  How can I say  Um  Commiseration maybe  A little bit  And um  You know  Ah I could help you  I think you should open  The halfway house though  Off the grounds  Of your property  No  But then I don't get  To see them naked  Naked's good right  Lydia  Naked is so good  Can we all agree 
[01:12:00]  That naked is good  Nothing wrong with naked  Dr. Lynn  I want to have sex  See that's what it is  And saving the world  With his giant hog  Ruining one vagina  At a time  He supposedly  Has a huge piece  Lydia  Is that right  Supposedly  But uh  I hate saying that  Yeah  You know  I don't want to  Disappoint anybody  His nickname in high school  Was Anthony the girth  Cumia  Ah  I know you're all  Wig  I remember when  They called me that  I bet you're like  Five by seven  You're probably  Wider than you are long  Yeah  I'm like a 
[01:12:30]  Short fat guy's  Pant size  Let's turn this around  On Lydia  Because she wants  To come in here  And analyze us  So what happened  With you and your mom  She's drinking  The martinis at noon  Oh no  My mom had a  Big time job  She was what  We call a  Functional alcoholic  But what  Go home  Drink  Fall asleep  By the pool  No I'm teasing  Ah get a sunburn  But what was the problem  She had with you  What was your issue  With your mom  I think that we both  Had strong personalities  And um  Bitchy Jewish women  That's what we're saying  You know I wanted  To go out  And have sex

[01:16:30]  That's why I wrote it  Oh  I think that can be  I'm just talking about  A past relationship  Yeah  This could actually be  A composite character  Of a few people  No kidding  But yeah  The talking nasty  To other people  The just being  Just profoundly drunk  In front of  Important people  Oh really  Like bosses  Possibly  Yes  Yes  Yes  Well not bosses  Possibly  Bosses  Do you be embarrassed  But would she ever  Like yell at other men  In the bar  Like would a girl 
[01:17:00]  Ever do that  Like where all of a sudden  You're like  Alright now how the fuck  Do I handle this  This big mouth idiot  Yeah yeah  It's like yelling  At some guy  At a bar  And I'd just be like  You know  You know  I'd make the old  Universal  Hey she's fucked up  Don't hit me  If you  You know  Want to take a swing  Feel free  I remember  The negotiations  Like you were talking about  Oh yeah  That would happen  All the time  It's like  Look  We're gonna have fun  Look  We're off the radio  In a couple hours  So  Just be cool  Until I get there 
[01:17:30]  Be cool  Hang out  Just have a couple  Beers maybe  Yeah  Don't  Don't hit the hard stuff  Don't do the jack  Until I get there  Monday morning  Well I have my  Had my own  Mini negotiations  Before going out  With my husband  Oh really  Oh yes  Was that because  Your husband  Didn't want you  Getting hammered  Or vice versa  Oh no  He would like me  To not get  So hammered 
[01:18:00]  Oh you drink  Lydia's a drinker  Yes she is  And she married  What we call  A codependent  Who had a drinker  In his family  That he couldn't fix  And then here's  Here's Project Lydia  Who stumbles up  The driveway  He's still working on me  There's a lot of  Nodding going on Jimmy  Stumbles up the driveway  A lot of nodding  You drink every night  No  Weekends  Lightweight  Yes  No and you  You hit a Thursday  Once in a while right  Absolutely  Thursday's the weekend  Let's  Let's  I'll be honest here  So you're a functional 
[01:18:30]  Thursday  When you drink  It doesn't affect you  Work  I don't drink at work  No no  But you know  It affects you work right  You can oversleep  Yeah I make sure  Not to bring it to that level  My job's too important  To my family  Oh that's  See  A little bit of responsibility there  Did your husband drink  Not much  Not much  Occasionally  Occasionally  When we met  He drank a lot more  Did he talk to you  About possibly  Maybe you should  Maybe you should try  Going to work  What are those meetings  They have  Do you ever leave literature 
[01:19:00]  Around the  Pamphlets  Around the  Wednesday night  Dark club  At the bar  Oh really  Really  I always listen  What's the longest  You made it  Over a year  Oh what happened  What made I take it back  I always go back  I love to drink  Miss it  See that's what happens  Is you don't change  Alcohol is only a symptom  Ah  Right  We gotta get to  The stuff underneath  We all fill ourselves  With things  It's a good symptom  Looks like you can't  Talk to Ann  About his drinking  It's a fun symptom  That's what I'm getting  What what do you mean 
[01:19:30]  She's talked about  You're drinking  On the air  The last couple of years  She's talking about  Your drinking  But she's  She's talking about  From the perspective  Of a tequila  She's actually  Poking her head  Out of a bottle  She's talking to  Drinking like  When do you want  To go out  And have some drinks  I'll fix you  Motherfucker  I'll do some shots  Yeah we should go  Drinking with Lydia  Yeah  Yeah I think  She'd be fun  I'd like to see  With a few in her  She fun when she drinks  Thumbs up 
[01:20:00]  And then  And then what happens  Then you reach this point  Where it's a big drop off  No no  Never a drop off  So you're not an angry drunk  That's good  You don't get the drop off  No  Not an angry drunk  That's good  You can't tell  When Ann's drunk  Really  A lot of people say  Every once in a while  He'll go to a point  Where you really know  But for the most part  You can't tell  Chatty and chatty  You can't tell  You can't actually tell  Though his eyes are open  He's awake  He fell asleep  In the sun yesterday  He's got a really weird  Sunburn today  And I'll be honest 
[01:20:30]  With you  I had  A half a beer  When I fell asleep  I had a half  Of a beer  The other half  Got piss warm  Next to the lounge chair  Because I was going to  Lay out  Put on the iPod  Nice cold bud  And just sit there  And drink the  And then I was so tired  That I just  I put the bottle down  And wham  Went right out  And I slept for like  Two hours in the sun  In the hot sun 
[01:21:00]  And that's why  I'm kind of  Kind of  Burned  Half sunburned  The odd thing is  I usually stay awake  When I drink  It's when I'm not drinking  That I get tired  And go to sleep  That seems to be the problem  Not enough drinking  Although  On movie night  That was fun  We had a couple of beers  That night  We went watching a movie  At Ant's house  And we look over  And he's peacefully  Just nodded off  He's a good host 
[01:21:30]  He's quiet  He doesn't bother anybody  I had the bottomless glass  That night  It was a Saturday  Pulling that tap  He's got a tap in his house  That's good right  I know one or two people  Have a tap in their house  It's sort of dangerous  Why  It's dangerous to you  What do you want  Bibles on every fucking table  Jesus Christ Lydia  Have some fun  It sounds like she does  Yeah I think Lydia  Does have fun  I think Lydia has a split personality  If you want to know the truth  Yes  During the day  She's this conservative psychologist  And at night  I think she's ripping it up  It's like looking for Mr. Goodbar 
[01:22:00]  Keeps up that front  And at night  Just inviting people home  She barely can keep it up  During the day  Drinking  She's just trying to keep control  During the day  Sounds like the 70s  And getting stabbed  By fucking Tom Berenger  Her husband's always  Got to pull her away  She's with me fellas  We have to go  Oh god  Oh shit  Don't want to be that poor guy  She's screaming at him  On the way out  You're just a racist  He's like  We gotta go  A racist  He might be a cuckold  Oh no 
[01:22:30]  Sorry sir  I don't even know you  I'm just making  Trying to make  A nice man  Seems nice enough  Gary's got a good sense  What line of work is Gary in?  He's a salesman  Okay  Oh  Does he have some exciting sales stories  When he comes home?  Yeah that would work perfectly  What does he sell?  He sells like  Electricals  Women's hair stuff  You don't even know  What your husband does  Electrical women's hair stuff  He's shaking his head  Like that's not what I do  We always get into an argument about this  I don't know what he sells  Do you don't really know anything 
[01:23:00]  I don't know  Crystal meth  Should we talk to Gary?  I think so  Gary you want to talk a little bit?  Yeah  Yeah Gary  We gotta get to the bottom of Gary  And what does he sell?  You know Lydia intrigues me  You know fuck her trying to get to the bottom of our shit  We want to figure Lydia out  Hell yeah  And then maybe we'll start  You scored a good catch there  There sir  You did alright  Yeah Gary you did alright man  Look at those boobies  How much did that cost you?  Or did she  Did you pay for your own boobs there Lydia?  No  How did that work?  I did not 
[01:23:30]  No  It was a gift?  Yes it was  From my dead mother-in-law  Wow  What?  Mother-in-law?  Oh my god  Now there's an odd situation  Wait so  So mommy leaves you a little money  And Lydia decides to use that money  To get big boobies?  No I decide  Oh  That's smart  How did that conversation go?  We can either have a summer house  Or you can have a nice set of tits  It was something that Lydia wanted  It was something that I wanted 
[01:24:00]  So it worked out  Are you happy with the results?  Very  Oh wow okay  Was she like flat before this?  No  And you didn't go too big Lydia?  No I didn't  I went another cup size  And I mean not to gross anyone out  But I breastfed two twins  So after that  My assets weren't exactly  You need a little fixing up  A little straightening out  When you say two twins  Not two sets of tits  Okay  Alright  One's hard enough  Right  So guy what is it  That she doesn't know about your job 
[01:24:30]  Because it probably  It probably bugs you  That she's always probably  Saying the wrong thing at parties  Yeah  He sells these electrical things  And kind of like  Electrical women hair things  Well I do sell clippers for the hair  And it's men's and women's  But I'm basically a manufacturer's rep  And we rep about 20 different companies  In the beauty care industry  Okay  So what would you say you do here?  At InnoTech  See  I hope he gets it now  He's laughing 
[01:25:00]  He's laughing  He's cracking up  I don't know how many times  That distinction has been made at parties  Yeah  When she'll go  He sells some hair things  And she goes  The clippers are for men  And women  And women  And I rep about 20 different companies  How many times has that clipped?  Yeah  I'm going to murder her  If she says this again  Speech has been given to a couple  They just met  Another martini  And tells them to shut up  Yeah  He sells things  And clipped pussy hairs  These are women's products  And men's products  You're saying Lydia might drink a little bit 
[01:25:30]  Oh yeah  At night  Yeah  She throws the wine  She drinks the wine glass  And then throws it in front of her  Against the fireplace  Obnoxiously  And they don't have a fireplace  They don't actually  No  Get me another one  It's the dishwasher  She just lit a fire in it  Yeah  She puts a bunch of newspapers  In the dishwasher  This is fire  I'm making marshmallows  It's time to go  Time for bed  Time for bed dear  Oh that is fantastic  So when you did  When you married to a psychologist  Is she like trying to 
[01:26:00]  Psychoanalyze you at home  Or does that not come into play  In your arguments  Oh it's happened quite often  Oh really  Oh what a nightmare  And I get to analyze that too  Oh  What's her big issue  Come on  Right now  The kids  How old are the kids  Five  Oh yeah  Okay  So she's like  What's wrong with having five girls  Do you feel ignored sir  A little bit  Do you feel ignored  Even though you love the children  I'm sure  But do you feel a little ignored  Just sometimes  Yeah  Just a little bit  Do you get personal time together  Enough 
[01:26:30]  Yeah  We manage some  It's never enough  It's never enough though right  Oh Lydia  Yeah  Especially after you have to  It's never enough for Lydia  Yeah  Sex is better when you've had  A few shots of Jack  I'll tell you that  Kind of loosens everything up  Yeah  We try and get our time in  But it's always a battle  Yeah  Because you have kids  Yeah  Not like it used to be  What uh  It's so hot  What are the kids like  Infrequent  What do the kids like to drink  Vodka  What are they  They would like to try 
[01:27:00]  Mommy's wine  But I think  I'll hold off on that  Oh you know something  Maybe some of those nights  Maybe when  Mommy and daddy  Want to be together  But the kids are awake  What's wrong with a little  Little sippy cup  With a little uh  Little chardonnay in there  Right  Put some right out  As I say that  I get upset  Because I realize  How generational it is  The kids are speaking  To each other  Mommy's having her  Sleepy juice  Sleepy juice  Where's mom 
[01:27:30]  She's asleep on the floor  With her pantyhose  Down again  She fell asleep  Fell off the toilet  She dropped her book  Are you trying to say  She drinks a little  Yeah  She was sitting on the  Bowl with a book  And she just kind of  Fell asleep  Used to just sleeping  Anywhere  Yeah  No pillow needed  Ever  No not at all  Daddy  Daddy  Piscetti's coming  Out of mommy's mouth  Yeah  We have to roll  Mommy on her side  Daddy says mommy's 
[01:28:00]  Gonna die like  Jimi Hendrix  Oh shit  Alright you've convinced  Me back on the wagon  That's right  It hurts  Oh no  It's the uh  The scars we don't see  Oh is that it  I like  Jimi's got all the  Sayings doesn't he  The scars we don't see  Life's what happens  When you're making  Other plans  Oh good gravy  Uh John Lennon  That's true  That's a John Lennon quote 
[01:28:30]  Oh is it  Sorry  Whatever  Is that a John Lennon quote  Absolutely  I did not know that  I thought it was  Sure I'll sign that  Yeah  Oops  To mark who  Ouch  Ouch  Ouch again  Ouch again  Oh god  Why isn't he shooting her  So um  Alright the twins are five  And it's kind of hard  To get your alone time  Yeah  Yeah  That's a universal problem  Who wants sex more  Between you two  Gary  Oh alright Gary 
[01:29:00]  That's why he's the guy  That had the  You know  Idea for the implants  Even though you know  Obviously  So why doesn't Lydia  Why doesn't Lydia want the sex  When he got Lorraine  I didn't say I didn't want it  I just said he wants it more  Well yeah  He's got the  The poison he's got to get rid of  Yeah  That's always  Guys  That's always building  That builds up  You see it with the students  Coming up to you  Talking about that  All the time  Right  The sex  I definitely don't want  To be a Mrs. Roper  You know  I don't want to be  Chasing Gary around a bit  No  I prefer it the other way around  Yeah  Exactly  Did the 
[01:29:30]  Do the kids get  Raging hard-ons  When they're trying to  Talk to you about  Their sex problems  Fair question  What man  You don't remember  Junior high  Where you  I thought you were  Talking about other kids  That has happened  Yeah  I have had to ask  Boys to take their hands  Out of their pants  When they're talking to me  How creepy  Wow  I'm glad I didn't go  With my first instinct  This would have been  A very awkward interview  Boo  So wait  They actually have it  In their pocket  They're playing pocket pool  Or their hands are actually  In their pants 
[01:30:00]  It's happened both ways  Wow  That's ballsy  Pocket pool I can live with  It's like I'm almost done  Be quiet  Actually in your pants  Pull down the top of your shirt  And shut up  I'm almost finished there  They'll actually do that  Yeah  Come on Coco  So they'll actually  Talk to you with their hands  In their pants  That's almost like  An aggressive thing  Yeah  You can take it that way  That can't be  And no one doesn't know  They're doing that  That's almost a form  Of aggression  We get a lot of kids 
[01:30:30]  Who are very angry  Where did you go to school?  You got a good education  At one of those  Malloway kind of college  I got a good education  I went to BU for undergrad  And then I went to  Teachers College  Nice  For a master's  In developmental psych  And then I went to  St. John's for school psych  And clinical psych  For my PhD  She's got the credentials  I'm starting to think  She's not even a psychologist  Really?  She made that up?  It's all the drinking  It's in her hand  I'm a psychologist  I'm an astronaut  Hang out 
[01:31:00]  Because people told her  She should be a psychologist  Because she's a good friend  On the phone  Yeah  She gives pretty good advice  She's like  You want to be a psychologist  And then she's just a psycho  So she's like  I am  You're a great listener  She's passed out  On the phone  She probably just hangs out  At a Chuck E. Cheese  Just bothering everybody  Telling what's wrong  With their families  She's not even a psychologist  So do you ever have to  Yell at her Gary  Like I'm not one of your patients  Not really  In an argument  What's an enraging thing  She'll do in an argument 
[01:31:30]  Like will she  Take on a certain tone?  Oh she has many tones  Oh  Do you ever get  Irrationally angry  Where you realize  I shouldn't be doing this  Do you analyze yourself  Afterwards?  No  Why did I get so angry?  I know why I get so angry  Oh yeah you know  Are you a yell or a screamer  Or do you talk  In clipped tones?  I think it can go both ways  Yeah  I see that she could  Get it going man  She could brawl  You could see it in her eyes  Oh yeah  This Lydia doesn't  Put up with shit 
[01:32:00]  When it comes down to it  Well you know I come from  Coney Island  So you had to be tough  Oh wow  She's one of the warriors  She's the girl  They had to bring back  With them  She's Valerie  Vulkenberg  Is that her name?  Valerie von Vulken  Is that her name?  That was a very big movie  When I was  It sure was  Oh yeah  The warriors  She was the girl  From Too Close for Comfort  Yes  Was in it  She played the dirty girl  Hanging out with a swan  Very good  I don't remember  She remembers the names  Very good  Yes  I just know  For what? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah  Sorry about that warriors  Just that pair of black lips  Sorry about that  She was the  Where in the world  Is Karma San Diego woman  Yes  I didn't know that  Yes  Indeed  Hey we got older listeners  You want to like do some  Some psych shit with Lydia?  They got kids out there  With their issues  Why not?  Give it a try  Sure  What age are you an expert at?  I used to also work  For the New York City Police Department  As a psychologist  Oh  With the cops? 
[01:33:00]  Yeah  Oh  That was a hard job  What was that  What was that like?  That was a hard job  What were you dealing with there?  I was dealing with cops  With guns in their mouth  In the locker room  Holy  Wait did you ever actually  Have to talk to someone  With a gun in their mouth?  What do you mean  When you say guns in their mouth  You mean just kind of like  Not literally but  I mean literally  Oh really?  I mean the captain calls up  But the other way around  Trying to shoot out of their mouth  And shoot a perpetrator  It's not a good way to hold a gun  Boo  Wait so they call you in  There's a cop  He's in his locker  The locker area  With a gun in his mouth 
[01:33:30]  And you gotta talk him out of there  My sergeant's in the locker area  He's got his revolver  He's saying he's gonna eat it  We had a hard shift  Who's Hong Kong?  I can't even beat up the  Anymore  It's not worth living  When you can punch a  Right in the face  Fucking dashboard cams  They've ruined everything  Why live  When the  Can just walk around  Oh my god 
[01:34:00]  Is that the kind of stuff?  Yeah  Some of that  Some of that  Who needs a phone book  To look up names?  So what would you do  When you get the call  And the guy's in the thing  With a gun  Do you actually walk  Into the room  Or how does it work?  Well it took so long  To get there  That by the time  I got there  He was dead  Which would be tragic  He heard you were coming  Jesus  I'd have to  Call highway patrol  They would come  And pick me up  And they always 
[01:34:30]  Took the scenic route  Because it was overtime  And then they'd take me  They just want to look  At your tits  Perhaps  Knowing there's a cop  With a gun in his mouth  They're taking the scenic route  Occasionally I would have to say  You know guys  This is actually  One of your own  Don't take me through  Staten Island  To get to one pp  I don't know him lady  I don't know him  I'm on the clock here  I would go  And I would  Talk to him  Talk him down  About you know  Living to see another day  Did they actually  Did it help them?  It helped them 
[01:35:00]  Get off the force  Oh yeah  Okay  You ever lose one?  Not a cop  Uh oh  Somebody else  Who'd you lose?  I lost a patient once  Oof  Do you feel guilty  When that happens?  Or like  God  I missed that one  No  How did I miss that?  No  No  Sad  Saw it coming though right?  There was someone  I tried to hospitalize  But the hospital  Wouldn't take them  Insurance?  Yeah  No they had insurance  The hospital  Wouldn't keep them  Stupid university hospital  Which  Boo 
[01:35:30]  Alright so you talked  How long did you work at cops?  I worked for two years  And why'd you leave that?  Uh I had a two year contract  Oh okay  The minute my contract  Was over  I left  That was it huh?  That was a rough one  Hard job  Did you see a lot of them  Crying?  Miserable?  A lot of cops  And very unhappy  Yeah it's a rough job  Rough job  Especially in New York City  What were they  What was the biggest  Resentment cops had?  I'm gonna guess  It was the fact  They felt underappreciated  By people  Pay  Oh pay  Oh pay really?  Pay  Wow  It's ridiculous 
[01:36:00]  What they get paid  Ridiculous amount of money  That's so stupid  For wearing a target  On their back  And dealing with the people  They deal with  And protecting  The POS's  That they sometimes  Have to go in and protect  Yeah  Well  There's a great clip  On the news today  Of Alabama  Cops  By the way  That just got fired  Oh what a fun clip  That is  But when you look  At that clip  The guy rolled out  Of his car  He's unconscious  They jump on him  You're like  Wow what dicks  But when you look  Did you see earlier  In the clip  Oh my god  He was aiming  Right for that cop  He jumped out of the way 
[01:36:30]  At the last second  Police chase  They sort of had  Like a roadblock  With a cop in the road  And this guy  Swerved right for him  The cop was able  To jump out of the way  We gotta explain the clip  Before everyone sees it  And then they  They're able to  Knock the car off the road  It rolls  And as it's rolling  The guy rolls out  Of his own car  He's unconscious  And then you see  All the cops running up  And just beat the shit  Out of the guy  Slid over and got a few shots  And at first they only show  That part  And then they give you  The long form of the video  And then you can understand  Why these cops  Are so upset  Where they're you know  Beating an unconscious man 
[01:37:00]  And they all got  Fucking fired  What kind of camera  Caught them  It was the  The dash cam  Yeah  Dash cam  Why don't you park  And aim the other way  With the fucking  Dash cam  But these guys  And brings up  A good point  To the story  Or a good  Yeah they  That's about a year old  That clip  It never came out  People knew about it  But they kind of  Sat on it  The prosecution  That was prosecuting  The guy  That was thrown  Out of the vehicle  Because you know  Obviously a criminal 
[01:37:30]  He's doing things wrong  So the prosecution  That is prosecuting this guy  Wanted the tape as evidence  So they gave him a tape  But they gave him a tape  Without that pesky  Little beating part in it  And they needed  Another copy  Because there was  Some kind of problem  With the copy of the tape  So they wound up  Getting the original  And the prosecution  Saw this  And actually had to then  Go to the defense  And say  Here  And hand it over  To the defense  Who then went  Oh my god  So why didn't they  Just give the prosecutor  The same piece of tape  They had given the first time 
[01:38:00]  Someone made a mistake  And just gave them  The entire tape  Is what happened  You think that was on purpose  It might have been  You gotta think  You never know  I mean  At that point though  The guy had already  Plead guilty  And was sentenced  To 20 years  Good  So he wound up in jail  But now he's  For millions  He's suing  Because  And it didn't kill him  He said he never knew  That he was beaten  Because he was unconscious  And in this  Horrific car accident  So he just thought  He sustained injuries  From that  That's why  They probably  Yeah 
[01:38:30]  But the thing is  Also  And I'm always  Going to be on the side  Of the cops  And yes  I am biased  In these situations  But I'll just  Let one thing out here  You never know  That guy got thrown  Out of the vehicle  I've seen plenty of clips  Where the guys  Get thrown out  Get up  And just start running  And miraculously  Start running  Or shooting  Or whatever the hell  Else they're doing  You don't know for sure  He's unconscious  He could be playing possum  He could be playing possum  With a gun under  Whatever  So they slide over  Did they use  Excessive force 
[01:39:00]  Ah sure  This guy slides in  He's like  He's sliding into second base  That's my favorite  Is the guy that just  Jumps on with his knees  No this is my favorite  The guy at his head  Who's just left right  Left right  Punching him  I love how everyone  Gets their shot in  Everyone got their shots in  And then  They always beat him  For a fucking minute  What the fuck  Yeah for a minute  Realized he was unconscious  He tried to kill a cop  With a car  It's like  That was dumb of them  To do  In this day and age  Everything is on videotape  You can't do it  They were all fired  All five cops were fired  I guess they're appealing 
[01:39:30]  Or something  They're very appealing  To me  On that video  Win it  Win it  Boo  They just wanted to  Kick his ass  Because he tried to  Run a cop down  Yeah  Well we got Lydia  In the studio  We got Michelle  In Pennsylvania  Has a problem  With her child  Hi guys  How are you  Hi Michelle  How are you  I have a question  For you Lydia  I have a little  Two year old  And she  Is an exceptionally  Willful child  And she's very  Independent  Willful  But I know that  She needs to be strong 
[01:40:00]  For you know  All the shit in the world  And all that good stuff  How do I get her  To kind of  Do what I need her to do  And yet not  Beat the willful  Well you know  Willful I guess  Is the wrong word  But how do I not  Get that out of her  Alright  Screw you  I know I'm boring  I don't give a clue  That's what you were  Soliciting Opie  I was soliciting  Hot fucking  Teen sex stories  That Lydia could figure out  You just said  We have some  Older people listening  Or people with children  I'm thinking you know  And they can call them  With their problems 
[01:40:30]  Not two year olds  That like  Like to wander around  A little bit  Sorry Michelle  Go ahead  Okay  Michelle one thing  That's important to understand  Is that at two years old  Your child  Is it a girl you said  Your daughter  Yeah  Your daughter  Is exploring her world  And trying to operate  On her environment  She's not being willful  She's doing what  She's supposed to do  I mean I'm not sure  Exactly what's going on  At home  But kids that age  Are testing the boundaries  Of their abilities  They're just becoming  Physical in this world 
[01:41:00]  And they're learning words  For example  No is a very big word  It's a very bad word  Yeah her favorite  Oh Uncle Paul  And that's perfectly natural  And normal  And you wouldn't want her  To do anything else  What specifically  Are the problems  That you're dealing with  Well she started  Throwing temper tantrums  At one  And I was understanding  That's pretty young  For that  You know  And I do the old  You know  Walk away  Ignore it  The whole kind of thing  But you know 
[01:41:30]  She's getting  She's really escalating  She's now starting  To hit me  And you know  I'll tell her no  I'll hold her hand  And then I'm done with it  You know  I don't force it  You know  Down her throat  But I do correct her  But you know  At the same time  You know  And then she just  Sulks for a while  You know what I mean  Like she just seems  More mature  She's raising a bitch  Than any other  Oh raising a what  You're raising a bitch  I'm trying not to  That's what I'm doing here  I'm trying not to 
[01:42:00]  Make another bitch  In the world  To ruin a man's life  You're doing exactly  What you're supposed  To be doing  You're correcting  Her behavior  You could start  Adding time out  But it's a minute  Per age  So that would be  Two minutes  Who came up with that  A minute per age  Probably a one year old  Per year  Per year  Right  A minute per year  Wow  I think that  What you ought to do  Is I always found  A good spanking helps  Over the pants  No 
[01:42:30]  Bare bottom spanking  Yeah both of us  They never learn  Jimmy I think I have  An idea of what  Your psychological  Intervention would be  Every time  Oh  Lydia how do you feel  About spanking  And hitting a child  I do not advocate  Corporal punishment  I believe that  When you hit a child  Military got to do with it  We all got hit  Exactly  Who cares if he's  A lieutenant  I got hit  Growing up  That's what I like  We all got hit  Growing up 
[01:43:00]  That's the big deal  Look at us  We drink like fish  There's a few parents  That always took it too far  But in general  It was  Other kids' parents  Were allowed to hit you  Yeah that was  Amazing  Why the fuck are you hitting me  You're not my father  You're so right though  That was the thing  Growing up  If you went over  Someone else's house  It's like  Mrs. fucking  What's her name  Hit me today  And the mother goes  Well you must have done  Something stupid  They didn't even question it  My mother  My mother dragged me  To someone's house 
[01:43:30]  And she screamed  To the woman  For slapping me  Really  Yeah  Some neighborhood  That slapped me  My mother marched me  Over there  A hooker  She went over  To a hooker's house  He wanted a blow job  That's right  My son paid  For a half and half  Half and half  My son wanted it  Around the world  Yeah  Can't do that now  We got another  Parent  Checking in  John in Jersey  John  Yes  Lydia  I have a  Five year old daughter  Who has recently  Been touching herself  My wife said  She had her pants down 
[01:44:00]  The other day  Under the covers  And she was  Touching herself  It's very common  Isn't it  And I asked her  And I don't think  It's that big a deal  But I asked her  The other day  Kylie why do you do this  I guess she used  My daughter's name  Because it feels  Good stupid  And she said  She said  I like to  And her eyes  Kind of rolled  Back in her head  She was kind of embarrassed  But I don't know  If there's any harm  I like to  Oh god  Just as long  As she doesn't say  I wish my fingers  Were as big  As the neighbors  Oh my god 
[01:44:30]  Hey Gary  I'm glad that  Uncle Paul  Hasn't chimed in  Just yet  Oh he's  Chiming in  All right  That's perfectly  Normal  Perfectly  Sure  Uncle Paul's  Hands on the table  I know  Let's go to the  Expert  Lydia  What's that about  Oh that's fine  You know  Kids discover  Their sexuality  Right about this age  At five  Yeah yeah  What the fuck  Was I doing wrong  You weren't touching  Yourself  You weren't getting  Boners at five 
[01:45:00]  Five  I was getting  Boners at five  Yeah  No  I mean  But as long as  She does it at home  I mean  I don't want her  At the neighbor's house  She takes off  Her clothes at home  She dances around  Naked  It's too much  Dances around naked  You're raising a good egg  Yeah yeah  Believe me  She's a psychopath  There's no question  She's going to  Scare guys away  Get her my first poll  Anthony  Do you want  To get her  Or what 
[01:45:30]  Anthony  Ten years from now  I'll give you my number  You can get in touch with me  Yeah there you go  At the ripe old age of 15  That's nice sir  Yeah that's wonderful  Come on  I'm only kidding  Yeah  I've heard  I've heard a lot of parents  Talk about that  The kids just start  Fucking  Jamming their hands  Down their pants  At like five  Six years old  That's fine  That's normal  Your job is  Yeah then they want  To give you  A fucking cookie  They got their hands  Down their pants  And they're like  Get out of here  That's why kids are filthy 
[01:46:00]  I don't want to touch them  Hey Lydia  Drinking the drink drink there  You're going to give me  Shit about this  Come on  You sound worse  In the studio  Than you do on the phone  Seriously  You have a tough voice  I'm just saying  She's very sexy in person  She's pretty sexy in person  I don't want to give you  A hard time  I'm just saying  Whatever  Don't insult me  I wouldn't even debate you sir  I know that my voice  Leaves a lot to be desired  That's why I had to come down  And prove I wasn't  As big of a mess  As I sounded  Yeah lighten up dude  You sound like  She's probably  Doing  Doing body shots 
[01:46:30]  I think Lydia sounds very smart  And I like Lydia  Hey Lydia  What do you think of this  This shitty mother  And her 13 year old son  With cancer  And she has one  These freaky religious people  You don't know that one  I didn't hear about that  They're on the lam now  Because the court  Was going to step in  And take the kid  From the mother  And say he's getting chemotherapy  Because he has a 90% chance  Of recovery  If he gets it  And a 5  10%  Well it's a 5% survival rate  If he doesn't  Well where does the other 5 go  Limbo  What do you become  A superhero  Well they throw 5% out 
[01:47:00]  Just because it gets  Everything sloppy  I don't know what that is  But that's what they said  It's 90% recovery rate  But 5%  That he wouldn't recover  If he didn't get the treatment  Then there's 5% that  Nobody knows  It's that  Yeah you get  Have a fucking  Well  Pudding factory  Coming out of your skull  Well what else we got for John  Before he leaves Lydia  John I just wanted to say  That that is normal  And your job  Is to teach your daughter  What's appropriate  And not appropriate  About sexuality 
[01:47:30]  It's not appropriate  For her to touch herself  Outside of say  The bathroom  Or her bedroom  If she wants to touch herself  She should do that in private  She  Don't make her feel embarrassed  About her body  It's okay to dance  Around the house  But you may want to point out  That she's getting a little old  To be dancing around the house  Naked  And maybe she should put on  Her bathing suit  Something sexy  Oh my god  Let's go on to 
[01:48:00]  Craig in Rochester  Craig  Hey Lydia  My nephew  My 3 year old nephew  Has a foot fetish  And it's been going on  Since he was about 2  He constantly  Crawls under the table  Pulls people's socks off  And starts stroking their feet  Wow  And they just lay there  For hours doing it  They've been correcting him  His parents have  And yell at him  And tell him to stop  But he keeps doing it  Should I take my kids  Away from him  Is he going to be a psycho  When he crawls up  He's either going to be  A rapist or a podiatrist  One or the other 
[01:48:30]  How old is he?  3  3  Wow  He's been doing it  Since he was 2  Well  You know  I really don't know  What to say about that  I don't want to give you  Bad news  But the truth is  That paraphilias  Like foot fetishes  Don't go away  If people are lucky  When they grow up  And mature  They find a partner  Who will work  With them on that  I wouldn't keep  My kids away from him  But they may want  To keep their shoes on  Okay 
[01:49:00]  Yeah  I don't know  That that's going to change  Right  Thanks for the good news  Where does the foot fetish  Come from?  Yeah what is that?  Do we know?  There are some theories  About that  Yeah it's mommy's toes  It looks like cleavage  And all that crap  When you're crawling  Around the floor  I've heard that theory  I think those  Psychodynamic theories  Are sort of outdated  Like Anthony was saying  About the analysis  Of the Rorschachs  That stuff's sort of outdated  Yeah okay  The more  Although lots of people  Still believe in it  I don't mean to 
[01:49:30]  No I don't  I'm not a psychologist  Rorschachs  A lot of people  Believe that  The way the paraphilias  Start is there's  A moment of excitement  That happens to be  Combined  With an object  Like a foot  Or something  And it just gets  It could just be  This singular moment  That just ingrains it  In your head  That's it?  One time?  Wow that would be weird  Huh?  What?  Your whole life  Takes a new path  Because of  Just because of  One lousy thing  That happened  You equate some  Good moment  With an object  You're doomed to  A lifetime 
[01:50:00]  Of creeping girls  Out by getting  A rod  When you rub  Their feet  A lifetime  Of ended  Relationships  They see you  Smelling their toes  Yeah I remember  That  Having a great  Moment  It was nice  Warm  Cozy  And just saw  A bottle of  Beer  All over  At that point  Let's see  If Joe's got  A good one  Joe in Tampa  Joe  Hey boys  Good morning  Hello  I got two  Full questions  One  When is Dr.  Lydia getting  Her own  Saturday Night  Fire show 
[01:50:30]  And I have  A  I have a  Seven year old  And I have  A four and a  Five year old  She likes to  Play the mommy  And the boss  And inflict  Punishment  On the other  Girls  How can I  Stop her  Doing this  The way to  Stop her  From doing  That would be  To stop  Doing that  To her  What she's  Doing is  She's working  Out the  Issues in  In her life  By gaining  Control over  Them by  Exercising them  On the  Younger children  So I imagine  That she gets  Punished and  Probably rightfully 
[01:51:00]  So and  Appropriately  That's true  Yes  And then she  Works through  Those feelings  Probably of  Resentment and  Anger by  Instead becoming  The mommy  Herself and  Punishing the  Bad child  And so now  She gains  Control over  It's actually  Called  Identification  With the  Aggressor  Okay  You got a  Name for  Everything  What the  Name for  Everything  You can  Wow  You know all  That with a  Hangover  That's amazing  I don't have  A hangover  Today  Today  Yeah this is a 
[01:51:30]  Very good  Question coming  In from  Bill in  Carolina  Bill  Oh Bill  Hey  Hey  When's this  Bitch gonna  Shut up  And show her  Tid  Oh  You know  We try  We try  We try  To just have  Some type  Of  Intelligent  Conversation  With our  Listeners  You say you disagree  With Bill  Not at all  But I'm just  Saying we try  I say we fail  Every time  But we try  You put all that  Money in  Now it's going  To waste 
[01:52:00]  Yeah do you  Show off your  Boobs in front  Of Gary  Just in front  Of Gary  They're Gary's  He paid for them  Well his mom did  Gary can we rent  Him for a couple  Of minutes  Rent him  I don't think so  All right  Rent girl  Rent a guy  Wife  Tits  Just to look at  He's waiting  But thanks for asking  That means we want  To see him  I appreciate it  You ever videotape  Yourselves going at it  Unlike that  Not that I know of  Gary  Gary has a hidden  Toilet cam hook up  Gary's a creep 
[01:52:30]  And she has no idea  Lydia's been online  In a news group  For ten years  Little pin tip camera  In one of those clippers  You got the close ups  Are the phone calls  Going well  I don't even know  Sure  The psycho babble  I don't know  Let's go to  Steve in Houston  Steve  Hey guys  What's going on  Hey  Hey what's up  Listen got two little kids  A three year old  And a four and a half  They don't listen 
[01:53:00]  They don't listen to me  For shit  I have to  Call their names out  Like five or six times  Before they come over  To me or whatever  Before I get to the point  Where I'm yelling at them  To check their hearing  To check their hearing  To check their hearing  Try candy  To check their hearing  Mr. Keller  Steve Keller  Calling  Hold on Steve  We're having fun  With your deaf jokes  Anthony's making deaf jokes  Sorry sir 
[01:53:30]  Go ahead  Alright what  What did we miss  My wife says to me  Stop yelling at them  They're not going to  Listen to you  But the only way  They will listen to me  Is if I friggin yell at them  What the hell  Lots of parents  Have this problem  And it turns out  We have it at home too  The more you yell  The more accustomed  They are to  The volume in your voice  And the louder  You have to yell  To get their attention  They turn selectively deaf  I suggest a sticker chart  I'm sorry  A sticker chart  I think I saw that on 
[01:54:00]  What was that  That nanny show  Oh maybe  They use a lot  Of behavioral techniques  And it's like  If they do certain things  They get a little sticker  Put on there  And if it's good things  Like oh they helped  Clean up or something  They get a little sticker  And it makes it like  You know they want  To get more stickers  Something like that  What I would suggest  Is a reward  For X number of stickers  And you arrange  With the children  When daddy  Calls your name  You come over to daddy 
[01:54:30]  And say yes daddy  And you get a sticker  Can I tell you  A little observation  None of this stuff  Really works  Because Lydia has  Five year olds at home  And she was nodding  And Gary was nodding  They don't listen to you  So why are you giving advice  To other parents  Do you have stickers  Yes we do  And it barely works  Right Gary  No it works  My father had something  Similar it was called  The strap  He would take it off  Of his belt  And hit us with it  He'd sticker his fist  To your lips  Yeah 
[01:55:00]  And had the spaghetti char  Yes  Sticker to the wall  Right  Anytime mommy and daddy  Would yell  The food for dinner  Would stick on the wall  And it was  That made an impact  Yeah  Studies have shown  That physical punishment  Works immediately  But actually increases  The behavior  That you're trying to stop  But sends it underground  Because kids smarten up  They do it more  But they do it  Where they can't be caught  A little more covert  Mmm  Does spanking take on 
[01:55:30]  Sexual overtones  I think it can  Yeah there's a fine line there  My mom hit my wiener once  With the tip of the strap  Yeah yeah  My dad used  My dad was a pro  With the strap  You can't just go in  And think you're gonna  Be a pro like dad  That was major leaguer  With the strap  He knew how to hit with it  My mom  After my dad  Went out to California  My mother thought  You know  She was gonna  Step up  And be able to  Come up from the minors  And use the strap  So she didn't fold 
[01:56:00]  The fucking thing over  Like dad did  Dad doubled it  And got in there  And whack  You know  Gave you a good one  On the ass  And that was about it  Mom had it just  Out straight  I was rolled over  Like in the bunk bed  The bottom bunk  That's where you ran  When you knew  You were getting hit  Because they couldn't  Get a good  Overhand swing  Because it would hit the  So they'd have to go  Kind of sidearm  But mom didn't know  What she was doing  So she hit  And the fucking  Strap tip  Wrapped around my waist  And made a  Bullwhip sound 
[01:56:30]  Crack  Right on the tip  Of my wiener  Ow  And I let out  A scream  And she dropped  The strap  She was like  I'm sorry  Oh my god  It's like  You hit my  Wee wee  Maybe you really  Don't have a big  She kissed it all  Better  Whore  And then you realize  She never hit it  You just psyched her out  Maybe you really  Don't have a big hog  And the swelling  Just hasn't gone down yet  Yeah it's still swollen  I need some ice  I just need ice  What a great point though 
[01:57:00]  Because you got hit  By both your parents  But your dad  Knew how to hit  A baseball  And a softball  You ever have  A family gathering  And mom's at the plate  Trying to take a few swings  Stupid  That same shit was happening  When she was trying  To hit you properly  Dad had a great swing on him  When he  Sometimes he didn't  Even have to use it  He could take that  Belt of his  Put it on the doorknob  When me and Joe  Were talking a little  Too much in the bedroom  He'd put that  On the doorknob  And just the buckle  Swinging on the door  Would be like  And then we  Don't talk 
[01:57:30]  Because the next step  From the belt loops  To the doorknob  Was the doorknob  To your ass  I never understood that  Because God forbid  Because you had  A similar situation  You shared a room  With one of your brothers  And when they tell you  To go to bed  It's way too fucking early  Obviously  And you're excited  To be alive  Like holy shit  Isn't this life shit cool  And they're yelling at you  For the excitement  Of being alive  Opie Opie  It had nothing to do  With us talking  They just wanted to fuck  It had  No 
[01:58:00]  No  Not even that  It had nothing to do  With the talking  I believe  He was very angry  And I think he was  Very angry  At his life in general  How it was working out  And there we were  Having fun  Talking about things  And we had our whole futures  Laid out in front of us  How enraged  I think that angered him  A little bit  Would you concur  I would say  That would be enraging  Just say concur  Concur  All right  What would he have done  If he hung the belt  And you just opened the door 
[01:58:30]  And yelled  Hey fucko  You left something  And slammed the door shut  Holy shit  Wow  Would that have been  A po-far  I would  If  That would have meant  Sure death  I said like  He heard me say  Masturbate once  And like almost  Like knocked me out  Wow  He said that's not  What we're doing together  And I was singing  Celebrate 
[01:59:00]  Celebrate  Dance to the music  And then I went  Masturbate  Masturbate  And he's like  What are you  Don't use that language  That's fun kid stuff  Use that fucking language  You little shit fuck  I don't want  It's like well  I learned it from you okay  I learned it from you  And we did shots  I don't want to lose this guy  We'll go back to  Your horrific upbringing  In a second  But first  Dominic in the Poconos  Because this is a really good one  Dominic  Hey guys  I'm a long time listener  First time caller  My son has stopped  Shitting in the toilet 
[01:59:30]  And I don't know  If it's a medical problem  Or if he doesn't want to go  And like  He'll shit in his pants  All the time  But not like shit  But we have to force him  To go  He'll hide in the corner  I don't know  What the hell to do  Fear the toilet huh  Yeah Lydia  How do you get these kids  To shit  How old is your son  Four  Fourteen  You're raising a comedian  Took a long time  For you to shit  In the toilet Jimmy  I would always shit  In my own toilet  And I would mess 
[02:00:00]  In my pants a lot  Really  I remember that story  About you shitting in school  And the girl said  You used to smell  Like you crapped in your pants  No Kelly howled  I had such a crush on her  And she went  Did you go poops  In your pants  And I was like  Yeah no  I was like  Yeah right  Yeah right  You're stupid  And I had it  I was rusty  Yeah you weren't lying  You said yeah right  Is that sexual shame Lydia  Yeah what's up  With the four year old  Not shitting in the toilet  Some kids are really scared  Of the toilet  They're scared about  What's going to happen  To their shit  When it goes down 
[02:00:30]  The toilet  It goes bye bye  And they don't like that idea  Yeah  Because it comes out of them  It comes out of them  And then it goes away  Forever and ever  And sometimes they're afraid  That they're going to go  Down the toilet  It's just a very  Sort of scary apparatus  Do you use a potty seat  Uh yes  Do you use  That's your kid  That's right  The potty seat  Has thumbtacks on it  He's a very bad father  And glow  Crazy glow  On the potty seat  They have a real laugh  Yeah  He's just trying to get  A good YouTube video  His ironing testicles 
[02:01:00]  Get stuck to the potty seat  And cries for three days  Get out there  Have you tried  The separate potty  That's not on the toilet  Not a seat on the toilet  Yeah but his  Is like rock hard  Too when he goes  Sometimes it actually  Clogs the toilet  Wow  Maybe he's holding it in  He's definitely holding it in  Because he's afraid to go  And it's now become  Such a big issue  You know what I would tell you  I would tell you  To totally back off the issue  Take one day off  Or spend a weekend 
[02:01:30]  Give him a laxative  Go to your doctor  Ask for a lax  A child laxative  I'm finger painting  And put the  Put the actual potty  Like wherever he watches TV  Or wherever he relaxes  And just make him sit  20 minutes on  20 minutes off  20 minutes on  20 minutes off  With the laxative  It takes a while  Just work with a kid  Just get a cat box  Yep  I actually gave him  A laxative warning  And he shit while he was sleeping  That's cute  Well you have to be careful  With the timing  Yeah  Laxatives are a lot like booze 
[02:02:00]  Yeah  I gave him a laxative  And then I sent him  On a 5K run  Good  I would suggest  You speak to your pediatrician  Ah that's a good idea  Oh the old  Pass the buck  I like it  Could be a little  Physical issue here too  Lydia do your kids  Shit properly  I concur  They do now  We did have a problem  With one child  Who didn't like  To use the toilet  Yeah  And we did something  Very similar  It worked out just fine  Well Anthony suggested  Totally normally now  Anthony suggested  The cat box  Would that be detrimental  If you took like  The loudspeaker  And you stood the kid  In the living room 
[02:02:30]  With the cat box  And screamed  Go I'm going to  Chop your penis off  Use the cat box  Or I chop your little penis off  Use the cat box  Use it  Shit now  Shit now  What's wrong with you  Why aren't you shitting  I will fucking end you  Shit in the cat box  Why are you running away  Oh my god  Would that traumatize  A little child  You know  I want Anthony  To be a father  So bad 
[02:03:00]  I would love to hear  Is that about control too  When you're not shitting  If you hold in your shit  That's got something  To do with control  Absolutely  Oh it could  Yeah look at  I'm controlling  Shit  Kids have  Little control  They have so little control  Basically means  You're raising  A Yankees manager  Boo  They won eight games  Did they  They're doing alright  Hey let's go to Jason  We get a little older child  Oh yeah  Let's go to Jason  Virginia Beach  Hey what's up boys  Hi  Hey Jay  Hey Lydia  My life right now 
[02:03:30]  Is kind of screwed up  About a week ago  My daughter got  First off  Her and my wife  Are getting a divorce  My wife and I  Are getting a divorce  And she's kind of  Upset at that  And about a week ago  Today  She started hitting me  In the back of my head  And I got scratches  All over my arm  Because she's so upset  To make a long story short  I adopted her  At two years old  And my wife  Out of spite  Told her  That I wasn't her father  Oh good one 
[02:04:00]  And it really upset me  I wasn't there  For this story  She took her down  To the ocean front  And told her  By herself  Without any  Of the other  Family members there  My parents  Wanted to be there  You know  Fifteen years ago  To tell her  But my wife  Was totally against it  I was always  Wanting to tell her  Because it was just  A waste on my shoulders  And to do that  Out of spite  I'm just worried  She's a straight A student  At a university  And I just don't want 
[02:04:30]  Anything  Well it probably  Already has  Psychologically damaged her  But I haven't  Talked to her  In a week  And I don't foresee  Myself talking to  Talking to her  For a long time  For what she did  To me  If I would  My dad was like  Anthony's dad  If I would have  Done that to my father  He would have totally  Just beat the living  Shit out of me  And I don't know  I'd be able to  Just walk away  From the situation  And I honestly  Drove back to my apartment  Crying because of  How she treated me  And now for all this 
[02:05:00]  Going through the divorce  We also have a  One and a half year old  Son together  And she's kind of  Keeping him from me  Even though I can't  Get him on the weekends  But I can't go by the house  During the week  To see him  And it's really killing me  With my son  I can't see my son  My daughter issue  And my divorce  And I'm just really  The wife sucks  I wonder if that's  That's not like  The wife is trying  To get the daughter  To side with her  And feel closer to her  In the divorce  Like you and I 
[02:05:30]  Are blood  And he's  Technically adopted you  So you should  Side with me  That's fucked up  When parents get divorced  And then put the kid  In the middle  A couple things  Happening here Lydia  Now  Is this normal  That a lot of people  Make a pact  To never tell their kid  That they're adopted  Either the kid is black  And they're white  It's always a mistake  Always a mistake  Always a mistake  Because things like this  Come up and  You know  Bite you on the ass later  Right  Well my wife 
[02:06:00]  Was always worried  About her coming off  Like a whore  In front of her daughter  That's  That was  That's a direct quote  Of what she said to me  She didn't want her daughter  Well she's my daughter too  She didn't want  Her to come across  Negatively  To her daughter  But now  I'm the dick  And I look negative  To her  Where I've always wanted  To freaking tell her  Well who's the original  Who's the biological father  I know his name  I just don't want  To give it out  I don't mean  What's his name  But I mean  Do you know him  Or does the wife 
[02:06:30]  Still know him  Do they have a relationship  Did they  No  They don't have a relationship  They lost  I honestly don't know  Because she made a contact  She made a comment  This past weekend  After she told her  I go  Well is she going  To contact her father  And she said  Well how do you know  That he hasn't  Already through the years  So I don't know  The truth  Jimmy  I really don't know  The truth at this point  Would you be jealous  Would you be jealous  If she like met  Her biological father  They became best friends  And started going  On vacation together 
[02:07:00]  And just hanging out  I don't think  He's that type of guy  From what I've heard  I think he was  And he may have  Changed his life around  In 17 years  I'm kind of hoping  That she does look  Because we've always  Had money  We've always had  Nice houses  I've given her  Everything she's ever wanted  Which is a mistake  On my behalf  Because she grew up  To be a spoiled little kid  And from what I understand  He was into drugs 
[02:07:30]  And so hopefully  Maybe one day  She will contact him  And see what type of life  She could have had  Versus the type of life  That I've provided her  But I always have believed in  The premise of  Nature versus nurture  I loved her with all my heart  But she always had  That kind of rejection  To me  Because of that  Biological connection  We never had 
[02:08:00]  And it just goes back  I don't know  If it's her father's genes  Or mother's genes  Or whatever  But I was always  Wanting her  To contact  Or to know  That I wasn't her father  Because I think  Medical history  Is very important  To a person  And I mean  Hell she couldn't  Go by my medical  History  And I don't know  What type of  Disease her father  Side of the family  Has  And I've always  Worried about that  Keeping  Just keeping it 
[02:08:30]  Secret for 17 years  Just really  Has wore me down  Over the years  When she was yelling  At you  After you  Wait  Really  Hello  We must have been  Disconnected  Was that guy still talking?  What happened?  Well me and Danny  Were going through  What happened?  Britney Spears  In a bikini  Pictures  During that whole conversation  Oh was that Britney Spears?  I was twittering  Yeah yeah  Was something going on?  I don't know  Oh okay  Poor guy  Oh you make a good hole  For the show 
[02:09:00]  Nice  Oh guys  No  He had a problem guys  What do we do  With that guy  Lydia  Wow he's in a bunch  Of shit  He's just pouring  His guts out  Like he wanted  A free session  We don't mind  If you pour your guts  Out on this show  But like  Spill them quickly  One gun at a time  One gun at a time  Exactly  He was untangling them  Laying them out  Like  Jesus  Come on alright  Spill them  He's got to go  Talk to his daughter  And man up with the wife  And insist on seeing his son  He's got to  He's got to tell her 
[02:09:30]  Look this was the pact  I made with your mother  I wasn't happy about it  But I figured it was the best  For you and everybody involved  But you know  I want to make it clear  That this is what I  I should be a psychologist  I know people that  You should be a psychologist  I've said that many times  Yeah I'm good  I'm good  No you  We always say  He should be in a psychologist's office  Yes  Not behind the desk  He should be a psychologist  So you look in the mirror  And go  What are you doing wrong  It's just mirrored walls  Yeah but the  Psychologist and the psychiatrist 
[02:10:00]  They're the ones  That are fucked up  That's why you  You could like  Discuss this shit  Right Lydia  Me and you Lydia  All we have to do is get rid of Gary  We'll make a perfect team  I know a lot of people though  That have been divorced  And the wife  Mom  Turns the kids against the dad  A lot of times  It happens the other way around  But more than  More than not  It happens where the  The wife turns the kids  Against the father  Especially easier  At an earlier age  To have that kind of influence 
[02:10:30]  On a kid  Yeah what is that about  Because to me  It's like that's just crazy  Why would you do that  You're just fucking your kid up  It's human nature  My parents are divorced  My father was always  Very negative about my mother  Yeah  Did it do anything to you  Because you said  You didn't have that  Good a relationship with your mom  It definitely made me see her  Through different eyes  Absolutely  More accurate eyes  Or  Somewhat  Because sometimes maybe  Somewhat  I think regardless  They should keep their mouth shut  Especially when you're a child 
[02:11:00]  Maybe let them grow up  And figure out  What each parent is like  On your own  Even if  You know  Your mother is a bitch  Or something like that  The father shouldn't be like  Oh Christ  Try living with her  She was a bitch  The whole time  But  You know  At some point  I guess they'll figure it out  Themselves  But they should  Parents should just  Kind of maybe  Shut up about the  I think what happens though  Is you know  Parents  The other one  Parents should do  A lot of things  But parents are people too  Their kids are their kids  But here they are hurting  Someone they loved  You went through a divorce  It may have been  Yeah but you know  It is if you want to hurt 
[02:11:30]  The other person  That's fine and dandy  But then you drag  You know  The kids that you love  Into it  You know  There's no thinking  Going on  There's no thinking  Of future consequences  There's just this  Immediate anger  And let me  You know  Let me get back  At this  One for being an idiot  Or an asshole  Or something like that  And you know  There's collateral damage  There Lydia  Collateral damage  My friend's parents  Went through a divorce  And it definitely  Messed them up I think  Yeah  Who's that 
[02:12:00]  My friend Ted  Really Ted  Yeah  It made him very  Industrious I think  My mother and father  Were divorced  They turned each other  Against me  They said  It's your fault  Teddy  The Shecklers  Were the laughing stock  Of the neighborhood  The Shecklers  Did your mom  Go back to her maiden name  No my mother  Started sleeping  With men  Who weren't  Of the white persuasion  My father said  It's your fault 
[02:12:30]  Theodore  They hit me  With a bag of duty  Oh poor Ted  Yes Ted  Ted really had  A horrible upbringing  My father  Would carry around  Glad bags  Of his own feces  And he would slap me  With them  Across the forehead  And ears  Poor Ted  Wow that's awful  It certainly is  Anthony  That's a little Ted  So tell the parents  Not to do that  Right Lydia  Don't do that  Don't put your kids  In the middle  Of the fucking  Divorce thing  When I lived in Huntington  It was like  A two family house 
[02:13:00]  And the landlord  Lived there  With his two daughters  He was in the middle  Of a horrific divorce  And I can't tell you  How many times  The cops had to show up  That's always a good one  Because the mother  Would come  To drop the kids off  Huge argument  The kids are on the lawn  Crying their eyes  And I'm like  Why would you fucking  Do this to the kids  Yeah  More than once  With the cops  People would rather  See their kids cry  Than think that  Their son or daughter  Loves the person  Who threw them out  More than them  Really  Wow  Alright Lydia  We got one more question  But I think we're gonna  We're gonna end 
[02:13:30]  In style here  We got Chad  In Binghamton  Chad  Last question for Lydia  Then we gotta get her  Out of here  Good evening  Good evening  I caught my kids  Messing with a window  A couple weeks ago  And gave my son  Who's five  A spanking for it  He left the room  And I hear my  Two year old daughter  Say  You gotta spank me too daddy  And I turn around  And look 
[02:14:00]  And she's on all fours  With her ass in the air  And her head twirling  Looking at me  Just grinning  That fucked me up enough  I did it  And she didn't cry  Or anything  And you did you spank her  Did you spank her after that  What's wrong with you  Oh you are horrible  What the  Okay I think that was  Your first mistake  She completely  Fucked me up  Jesus  Why did you spank her  Cause she scared me  She scared you 
[02:14:30]  How old is she  Two  Two  Almost three  Alright  Quite the little girl  There sir  She is gonna be a good one  When she gets older  You're gonna have  A lot of problems  In the next few years  You're right  Even the threat  Of spanking her  Makes her cry  You were right  It's like a  A real stumper  Yeah  What do you do  In that situation  I know  Obviously you don't  Spank the kid  Yeah sir  I'd really  Actually  I'm sorry to turn  This around on you  But I have to ask  Where your judgment was  When that happened 
[02:15:00]  What were you thinking  What were you thinking  Mainly it just  Messed me up enough  That I  Couldn't think straight  There's a good reason  To stop spanking  Your kids  Are you kidding sir  He's kidding  You fucker  What a dick  I was so  I'm kidding  That's a good one  I was kidding  Spanking  Disciplining  Don't let everyone  Off the hook  You want everyone  To think it's real 
[02:15:30]  That is crazy  Good one Chad  Thank you  If that would have been  No problem  You want to go real serious  Oh my god  You want to go real serious  Or you want to end here  Yeah let's go with the awful  Real serious  Or we end here  If it's going to be  A suicide then  No  No no no  Because that's  That's real serious  To me  Oh no  Okay  Oh I'm you know  You want to leave  It's going to be a real moment  I know you can't handle  These real moments  I handle real moments  Yeah watch how uncomfortable  Who is this bitch  Hello  Hello 
[02:16:00]  Who's this  This is Joe  From Long Island  Hey Joe  Hello  I'm okay  I was hearing  Your discussion  And  I'm divorced  Seven years  I had  Two children  My 17 year old  Daughter  Five years ago  Died in a car accident  Because my ex-wife  Told her that  I would not put her  Through college  And my 19 year old son  Doesn't talk to me today  What do I do 
[02:16:30]  Well a little detail  So the 17 year old daughter  Killed herself in a car  No no no  She didn't kill herself  She was on the way home  From a job  Right  Because she took a job  Because my ex-wife  Told her that I wouldn't  Pay for her to go to college  And on the way home  From that job  One night  She was killed  In a car accident  Oh man  But you're saying  That it was because  You were not sending her  To college  I mean  No no no  That's not why  No it's because  If he would have  Paid for college  Right  She wouldn't have  Been there working 
[02:17:00]  Right  Which means she  Wouldn't have  Been on the road  And she wouldn't  Have died in a car accident  So it's a bit of a stretch  Yeah  Exactly  Is that why  Also  The car that was  Given to her  Was one of those  Old Saturns  That folded up  Like paper  And my brother-in-law  Gave it to her  There's plenty of guilt  To go around huh  Oh big time  Is that why  Your son's not  Talking to you  No my son  Doesn't talk to me  Because of  Whatever my  Ex-wife has told her  And she made  Our divorce  A living hell  That lasted 
[02:17:30]  Four years  Because she was  Only interested  In property  And money  First off  Let me let you  Off the hook  Your daughter's  Death is not  Your fault  I know that  It's not my fault  I grieve  My daughter's death  But I still  It hurts terribly  That my ex-wife  Would actually  Say this to a child  It's hard to believe  That someone  You once loved  Could hate you  So much  To be so cruel  Well like I said 
[02:18:00]  It was all about  Having a boyfriend  And money  And getting  Everything that she  Wanted  Which  It sounds like  This is still  So fresh for you  Like it happened  Yesterday  I'm divorced  Since 2002  And my daughter  Died  Two months  After our divorce  You can't bring  Your daughter back 
[02:18:30]  There's nothing  You can do  About that  Except to let  Go of the guilt  Holy shit  For the first time  Ever  I am so  Uncomfortable  Yeah well I've  Let go of the fact  That my daughter  Died  You know  Needlessly  And I grieve her  And I also forgave  My ex-wife  For what she did  Even though she  Doesn't believe it  I wrote her a letter  Telling her that  Because you know what  If I carry around  This pain  And this anger  It only destroys me  Yeah  Have you tried  To talk to your son 
[02:19:00]  Yeah he talks to me  Let's see  You got money  Dead  But other than  You know  Asking for money  Or for medical  It doesn't go any  Further than that  It's hard to hear 
[02:19:30]  This stuff  I think you hear  That the boys  Are having a little  Trouble hearing  This stuff  Yeah I know  That they are  But that's okay  I understand  Their motives  You have to try  And reach out  To your son  In any way  No  He's dead  Yeah I try  To reach out  To him  But he's  Very  Non-cooperative  Keep trying  You can't  Control how  He reacts  All you can do  Is control 
[02:20:00]  Your attempts  True  That way  If God forbid  You died tomorrow  You knew  You did everything  In your power  To make that  Relationship better  Are you kidding me  My son tells me  He wouldn't come  To my funeral  You can act  Like a man  What's the matter  With you  He will have  To live  With that grief  And lack of closure  With you sir  But you don't  Have to live  With that  You do everything  You can  To make things right  And know that  You've done  Everything you can 
[02:20:30]  No one can do  More than that  Okay  Okay terrific  Okay terrific  Good luck sir  Sounds like a tough  Situation  Thank you very very much  And have a good day boys  Oh take it easy  Sorry about your loss  Got it man  You're gonna be okay  I am  I've never actually 
[02:21:00]  Been grateful  To not have  A sound clip machine  So mean  Wow  Oh god  I didn't do anything  Funny but man  He doesn't like  Real moments  What  Is that what it is  I guess you're  Uncomfortable  I have to do stuff  Lydia this has been  Terrific  I think you should do  Do we do Saturday  Night viruses anymore  I don't even know  If we do  Oh Dan  That makes me feel  Really good  Dope  No we just adjusted  The schedule right  For real 
[02:21:30]  No it's been the same  Dr. Steve just  Called me an ass  Did he  Dr. Steve just  Texted me  Ha ha you ass  Oops  We should give her  A little virus action  They're available  When you know  When others are available  Unfortunately  They have not been  Available  That's what I mean  That's what I'm getting at  It's still going on  You know it's just  Becoming more difficult  Yeah there's less  And less  And there's confusion  Out there  That's all  I'm getting it  Out there for people  We should give Lydia  A little action  When we can  Sure 
[02:22:00]  I can't wait for that  Yeah  I have no idea  What you guys  Are talking about  Virus action  I don't know  Yeah you don't want that  A little like  A little radio  On the weekend  Gotta keep it fun  Though Lydia  You can't like  Psychobabble  Until they fall asleep  Though  I'll bring my  Rorschach cards  To that  Opie  Yeah  I wish you would  It'll fit right in  Visual bits on the radio  I actually did  I did bring them  Anthony  Oh did you  I can show them  To you during the break  Alright  I don't want to look  At a couple 
[02:22:30]  Hey to BS in New York  Go fuck yourself  Have a heart  Hey Opie  How about some  Dead dad jokes  You prick  I had nothing to do  With that one  You fucking asshole  It was me  You cocksucker  Why don't you listen  Closely to the radio  I was the one who said  For the first time ever  I'm uncomfortable  So go fuck yourself  Go fuck your mother  You cock  My dad's dead too  Ha ha  You're still alive  Ha ha  You still have to go  Through the pain  Ha ha ha  When he dies  Go fuck yourself  You piece of shit  I had nothing to do  With that one  Mine's all over 
[02:23:00]  I can have nice thoughts  Of pleasant times  And even uncomfortable  Ones now  But he's dead  And that's fine  You still have to  Go through it  Ha ha ha  I hope it's soon  And tragic  Loser  Go away  Lydia this was great  We're going to have  To have you back  That was really  Uncomfortable  But I really laughed  It's like when  You're not supposed  To laugh  That was so  That's one of those  Things that I said  It's a very sad story  It's like I thought  About it  And probably shouldn't  Have done it  And just thought  About it  But I actually  Did it  After the first 
[02:23:30]  Yeah then you did it  Yeah see  That was the bad part  It's very rare  That I'm shocked  On the show  And when I heard  That first sound effect  I could not believe  I just heard that  It was horrible  That was a cringe moment  Very inappropriate  I'm going to feel  Very bad later  When I think about that  Oh you should  I will  Well we got to take a break  Like after the show  I'll be like  That was probably mean  To make the man feel bad  He sort of went with it  Yeah sometimes  Thanks to your hospitality  Then again you don't call  No problem  Even though it's sad  It's hard to call  The Opie and Anthony show 
[02:24:00]  Exactly  Thank you Jimmy  You know it is  For rationalizing it for me  Yeah but not to say  That you're not garbage  I'm not garbage  But in Anthony's defense  Anyone who calls  Myself included  Has to know that  You know they're opening  Themselves up to be  You got to be able to take it  The big titted shrink is right  Speaking of which  They need a picture of her  So we should go to break  And I should tweet  A picture of Lydia  I did it already  Yeah not to tell you  No I didn't  No  I'm live  Go to break

[02:32:30]  Okay  Oh Kenny  So we're trying to make you  A DJ  I think some of these channels  At SiriusXM  Should just pick you up  To do a little guest DJ  I agree  I'm a natural  I would listen to these channels  If all of a sudden  I knew you were going to be on  For an hour  Doing your thing  Yeah  You're trying to get on  The Highway  Which is a kind of  Newer country channel  Here on SiriusXM  This is the one we played  About an hour ago  Then we're going to play  The newer ones  I actually listen to this channel  A lot  No you don't  The Highway?  It's newer country  You don't like newer country  Do you? 
[02:33:00]  Carrie Underwood  I do like her  No stop  Look at it man  Is he acting?  Yes  He went like this  My eyes open  He had me  You had me  Until that weird look  At the end  I like it  But I don't listen to  I'll listen to  Old school country  A little bit  Sure  What is it called now?  Willie's Place  Or something  Classic  I'll play Carrie Underwood  Just for Jimmy  I lied by the way  I never heard this station  Why would you? 
[02:33:30]  Terrific  It's the Highway  XM-16  Sirius 60  And I'm country  Kenny  Cow shit  Up next is  Toby Keith  He sold 25 million albums  And here's his hit  Stage in Mexico  Too bad he wasn't singing about the swine fluke  His name was Steve  Her name was Tina  Yes  He hated her 
[02:34:00]  Her vagina  That country thing  It's just another world  Oh yeah  Yeah  Well Kenny fits right into that world  Because like I said before  He hit the post  With cough  He was coughing  And hit the post  He did great  Miracle  Who runs the Highway Channel?  Because now we've got to play this for them  The guy  Some guy  Some stiff  Kenny cow shit should 
[02:34:30]  Who probably takes it too seriously  Yeah he probably has a big hat  The cowboy hat  Yeah  Big rim  Here's more of Kenny's country radio demo  Here I can hear a thing  Howdy  It's the Highway  XM 16  Sirius 60  With me  Country  Kenny cow shit  And when I'm not fucking a relative  I love listening to Rascal Flatts  And here comes goodbye  A goodbye  I can hear a thing 
[02:35:00]  Oh  Wow  Hit in the post  Damn you are good Kenny  He's getting better at this  This now  See  Oh look I gotta sit down  I'm impressed  I think he would have gotten a  Jesus Christ  I don't know  There's some teen  Beating up a man  That was in a little rascal  Scooter  And robbing him  That is just  And of course  It's just a savage  Is that a  Is there a racial difference there?  Yes  Yeah  Yeah of course  It looks like it 
[02:35:30]  Driver takes off  There's a traffic stop  Runs over the cop  Look at this  He ran him right over  I have no qualms  With cops  Beating the living fuck  Out of people that run  And look  Right on the bottom screen  We got the old  Unconscious guy  Getting the shit beat out of him  Good  I love when cops  Just beat the piss  Out of perpetrators  Yep  I don't care  If they're unconscious  I don't care what color they are  I don't care what the fuck  They were doing  I used to love it too  It must have been so much fun  And that was pre-dashboard cam 
[02:36:00]  Ken  Yes sir  You know  Yeah back in the day  Kenny hinted a little earlier  That you know  Dashboard cams  Not a good thing  Who got that done?  Probably because there were  Cops getting killed  Like there was a cop killed  In really just  Where was that  County Texas  With the three  Colombian guys  Whatever  They do help more  Than they hurt  As far as cases go  But I mean  There are times  Where you probably  Wish you would have  Hung a Huey  Before you got out of the car  Yeah no 
[02:36:30]  They're great  For cops with integrity  It's fine for police safety  People want to hear you  On the highway  They're loving this  Let's go to the next track  Kenny introduces  Kenny Chesney  No shirt  No shoes  No problem  Huh?

[02:37:00]  It's me  Country  Kenny cow shit  On the highway  XM 16  Series 60  And coming up next  We got Kenny Chesney  His song is called  No shirt  No shoes  No problem  Because he comes from  Luttrell, Tennessee  You know  Four square miles  Of poverty  Where the medium  Family income  Is 20 grand  Besides Kenny Chesney  That town's claim  To fame  Is that it has  Five registered  Sex offenders  I've read that 
[02:37:30]  On the internet  Yeah  I can read  See this is what  You needed  For the disco thing  This is so much better  So much  That I cannot  See them  Turning this away  Who runs highway  Play country music  On the disco channel  No  Stupid  That's right  I think there's  Someone named Mojo  Mojo  I think that's his name  From the highway  Who wouldn't listen  To Kenny doing  A guest DJ spot  On the highway 
[02:38:00]  Letting him be an idiot  I can tell you who would  Five of us  We would all listen to it  Yes  We would  A lot of country fans  Would turn it off  Angerly  Yeah perhaps  They'd lose some of those  Who is that piece of shit  Making fun of our music  They would not go for  Your shenanigans  I like that boy  He got a good sense  Of humor  Dang it  Dagnabbit  Save money on a horse

[02:46:30]  Here is Primetime Sam Roberts  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts  And regular guest, comedian, and idiotic friend of the show  Rich Voss stopped by to say hello to ONA recently  And accidentally gave his online password out on the air  We caught up with Voss in the hallway  After his Facebook, Twitter, email, and other such accounts had been hacked by listeners  Voss, what happened today on the show?  Nothing, I just came in 
[02:47:00]  I was a funny guy  And you know, we had a good time  A couple mistakes were made here and there  Pretty much my mistake  But what were you thinking  Giving out your password?  That was your email password?  Your Facebook password?  Your Twitter password?  Why would you give that out on the air?  Yeah, it was a major profile  And believe you me  I fucked up  And it sent me into a shamble  Yeah, I saw you out here trying to figure out  Making sure people could fix your email 
[02:47:30]  And trying to get your bank account straight and everything  I was fucking sweating like Norton waiting for his AIDS result test  No, that sucked  Really?  His AIDS test result  But of course, could that be a happier fucking punchline?  No, Voss, it probably couldn't  Lucky for us, Voss' entire family showed up at the studio  And we were able to talk to Voss' wife, comedian Bonnie McFarlane  About her husband's massive blunder  You got a chance to see Voss today in all his glory  I see him every day in all his glory 
[02:48:00]  What went through your head when you got the phone call  Of Voss saying that he had just given out his email  Facebook, Twitter, and all account password on the air  I just immediately thought everything was going to crash  Everything  That someone had a key to our house  Our bank account was drained dry  Everything done  Obviously, Voss and Bonnie didn't quite know what to say  So we located Voss' baby daughter  And asked her how she felt 
[02:48:30]  About being the offspring of Rich Voss  Right here  Want to look out the window at the houses?  Thanks, everyone  And don't worry, Voss  Nobody would ever want to steal your identity anyway  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts  And this has been  Backstage with ONA  Wow  He can't get anything right  We were going to go to break  But we have to comment  He's looking out a window  Forty stories up  With his kid going  You want to look at the houses? 
[02:49:00]  The houses?  The buildings?  I was sweating like Jim Norton  Waiting  For his aid test  Results thing  Aid result test  Wow  Yeah, wow  He is just a piece of work  His aid  Aid results test  Aid results test  Is pretty much what he said  Yeah  He put the plural on the wrong place  Yeah 
[02:49:30]  He's stupid  Wow, someone doesn't like Sam's radio voice  Sam, you might have to defend yourself  Why is that?  What's up, Paul?  Hey, that Paul  Hey  Good morning, fellas  Hey  Yeah, really  It's been getting on my nerves  That Sam's trying to sound like a man now  What do you mean?  This is me  No, you take radio voice  That you use in your bad woman promo  Oh, shit  In which promo?  Oh, shit  Where he goes  I'm prime time Sam Roberts  Yep, I agree  What do you mean?  I sound like a man and a woman promo  Why don't you pick a gender? 
[02:50:00]  Oh  No, no  That's the point  What if you pick a gender?  Oh, shit  Oh, shit  Back to you, Sam  I pick boy then  Male  Oh, shit  Back to you, caller  Damn  You like boys?  No, that's not what I said  That is stupid  You told me to pick a gender of what I am  And I said I am a male  But I like the company of females  And what do you have to say about that?  For what?  Your clothing?  I don't understand  For my clothing when it's on the ground  Your bad hairstyle?  Oh  On the ground  Fucking a girl 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, next to the bed  Yeah, yeah  I'm not sure what's worse  This or you and your bad Eastside Dave  What?  What?  My bad Eastside Dave what?  Oh, the wheels are falling off  Oof  Come on, caller  Hang in there  Hang in there  You're gonna be okay  Come on  You can't go toe-to-toe with me  Don't call up here and embarrass yourself like this  I'm not embarrassed  You're the one with the bad voice  The bad fake voice on the radio  Are you kidding me?  I broadcast professionally for a living  Well 
[02:51:00]  You kind of produce behind the scenes for a living  They allowed this charity on the air  Oh, man  He nailed you there  He nailed you there, Sam  He got you  Really?  Yeah, that was a good one  He's calling your material charity  That we're charitable by letting you on  Yeah, we're just lazy  So we give you a little airtime  He's saying that we give you polite laughs  Like Pesci did when De Niro was being obnoxious  At the table with the mobsters  That, ah, smile on  Yeah, yeah, yeah  I'd like to defend that point 
[02:51:30]  But, I mean, if  Well, you could try  To you  Because I think  You know what, guys?  Let's just leave it at that  Obviously, you're hanging  He wants to go out winning now  We're all running out of steam  Nobody's running out of steam except you  Nobody  The Opie and Anthony show never runs out of steam  We never have it to begin with  Yeah  What's steam?  That's not true, Jimmy  Thank you  Thank you  Why don't you just hang up?  Literal caller  Someone else saying you sound like  Someone else  Thanks, bro  Someone else saying you sound like Casey Kasem  Steve, look at that  One of the finest broadcasters of all time 
[02:52:00]  Thank you very much  Really?  Weird voice  Yeah, but he was on Saved by the Bell  Was he?  Was he?  Yeah  What did he do on that dumb show?  Casey Kasem?  He judged the dance-off at the max  Oh, I thought maybe he was a recurring character  No, he was Casey Kasem  He was a special guest  He was a big star  Wow, that must have been exciting  Who was your favorite on Saved by the Bell?  Of the guys or the girls?  See?  See?  What?  That's not going to help  You should have went right for a girl's name  Well, I'm saying like  I mean, what are you doing?

[02:53:00]  Did you hate that you're related to Screech?  I didn't like that  And it really bothered you  And you wanted it to be more the jock?  Screech's name was Samuel Powers on that show  And since my name was Sam  People used to reference that at school  Which I thought was way out of line  I never would have known that his name  Samuel Screech Powers  Yeah  You know  Max Power  Could you say  Hey Scooby?  Hey Scooby  No, like Casey does it 
[02:53:30]  Casey Kasem was like the voice  Yeah  He  I don't know how to do  Casey Kasem's cartoon voice  He has this thing where he comes in  The way he says his name  I'm prime time  It's very over the top  Entertainment reporter  Kind of thing  I gotta admit I like it though  Of course  Because it's so ridiculous  It's great  Because it sucks  Right  We know  This is a professional piece of broadcasting  It's a piece of something  But  Try to go deep with your voice

Perfect  I mean I'm talking  Do they have the little paper thing  Around them too?  Did you ever shove one  In Monica Lewinsky's badge?

I wouldn't  Jimmy  It was the shit  From the Guinness  Was making 
[02:59:00]  Big streaks  In the toilet  Amazing  And even leaving it there  A while  And then flushing  The water wouldn't do anything  I needed a scrub  You don't scrub though  That's obvious  What does it mean  If you have incredibly  Sticky poo?  That means you drink a lot  Not good  It means you drink a lot  Not good  It means not enough  Roughage actually  And you have cancer  It means you have  Cancer of the eyes  What is that?  I don't know  If I don't use  The toilet brush immediately  It's just like

[03:20:00]  Speaking of Radiohead  He'll never kick in  This is what's great  When you talk music  And I  Completely understand this  By the way  Just is the best radio song  Ever  The very next  Is a feedback Anthony  Yep  Fuck Radiohead  Every song is whiny  Cry  Baby bullshit  This is Doc from Atlanta  They rip off  Jesus and Mary Jane  The Joy Division  And countless others  Plus the singer  Looks like Clay Aiken  Wow  Given that  It kinda does resemble him 
[03:20:30]  A little bit  But  Steven Madison  Opie Radiohead  The Benz is amazing  But OK Computer  Is their best CD  How can you be a TV  On the radio fan  But not like the  Experimental Radiohead stuff  TV on the radio  Fucking  Fucking black girl  Turned me on to that band  And I  I liked it for maybe a week  And then I didn't get it  Then that was it  Yeah  Yeah  They're very experimental  Jesus Christ  Um  What do you got here  This is a question that  I've had for a while 
[03:21:00]  I don't know  Maybe Danny could clear this up  But I know a lot of people  Are wondering this  With the whole Blu-ray thing  Um  I'm reading down here  Someone says  Apocalypse Now on Blu-ray  Alright  What the fuck is done  To  Make it  Blu-ray  Uh  It's  It was filmed  At a time that  You know  They couldn't really  Yeah  Put it in that format  They actually re-shot  The whole movie  They got the cast together  And they got 
[03:21:30]  Everyone  They all look a little older  Right  And um  Marlon Brando  Wasn't available  Because he's dead  Yes  So they had to prop  His body open  And move his mouth  With little puppet strings  They said it looks odd  Yeah  Because you probably  See it on the Blu-ray  Yeah  Yeah  Except for everything  More detail  Yeah  You know  I always thought  That it would be  A great like  Goof idea  In Hollywood  You get one of those  Movies that was  Really good  Like Fast Times  Or something  Maybe not Caddyshack  But you gotta find  A movie where the  Cast is willing  And still alive  And like you just said 
[03:22:00]  Redo the comedy  Frame by fucking frame  That is an interesting idea  Who wouldn't watch that?  All the dialogue  Every shot  You don't change anything  No  Right  At all  Except the diapers  At all  Wow  But you gotta get a movie  Where most of the cast  Would be into it  It's gotta be an older movie  Yeah  Obviously some will say no  Or would be dead  So you try to like  Fill that in  Fill it in with who?  I don't know  Someone 
[03:22:30]  Like because Fast Times  Is a good example  That would be a great one  Sean Penn would never do it  They're alive except for  Mr. Hand  Who is dead  Right  And what's his name's  Wife  Oh  She was the one  That was shot  She was the one  By Spector  Phil Spector  Allegedly  But she had a little part  In that  That's right  I forgot about that  Yeah  Yeah  And he was also  The villain in Ghost  Well he wasn't really  The villain  He was just kind of  The weird guy  That taught Patrick Swayze  He taught Patrick Swayze 
[03:23:00]  How to you know  Do shit  Didn't he teach Patrick Swayze  Kind of how to  How to not fall  Through trains  Get off my train  Yeah yeah  And move shit  He was in  He was in  Cuckoo's Nest  He's Bob Beatman's  Brother  We're the best  At visuals man  I heard  It was funny  Talking to Bob  And his brother  Nothing  Just the two of them  Anti-matter  And anti-matter 
[03:23:30]  They cancel out  All fun  They walk into a room  Fun just sticks to them  Like a magnet  With metal shavings  And then they walk out  With it  Remove it  What you guys are missing  They really think  They're fun  They do  They really think  They got it going on  They talk about things  They have no clue  How boring they really are  No  You sit down with them  And you're just like  I'm  I am so bored  You told me this morning  He kept you out to 1.30  1.30  I'm like  Obviously you fell asleep 
[03:24:00]  They didn't realize  And they finally woke you up  At 1.30  Yeah  Because I'm like  There's no way  You would have hung out  With them for three hours  I must have been  Out at the table  You know  I think they  They bought me  Glasses of wine  Just to keep me there  Like yeah  How about another drink  Stick around  We'll talk a little while  Oh okay  As long as I'm  Boozing it up  I think I can  Stand your company  If you want your answer  To your 
[03:24:30]  Apocalypse Now question  Yes  Originally  I had a  A theory  So I just researched it  Real quick  And it is accurate  It's basically scanned  From the original film  And it's  When they do the  Digital transfer  It's actually  At a very high resolution  So when you take that  You put it on DVD  Obviously a DVD  Can only display so much  So anything that's  Converted to Blu-ray  Is going to look  Extremely better  Than it would have  Even though it wasn't  Shot in  In Blu-ray  Blu-ray or HD  Right  It's still  It's you know  That copy is  Digitized at a much  Much higher resolution 
[03:25:00]  It's yeah  Pretty much the exact  It's basically just  It's a carbon copy  If you will  Of the film  So you're looking  At the film  Like the original print  Pretty much  Is it out now  I guess so  Blu-ray  What are the features  The special features  I don't know  They should have some  Though  They always do  Travis saying  It's not out on Blu-ray  Just yet  When is it on Blu-ray  Hang on  When Travis  It should be coming out  On Blu-ray  What's the date  I will tell you  Some movies  I'll tell you the truth  I can't fucking tell  The difference  Between just a regular copy 
[03:25:30]  And Blu-ray  Especially the new ones  Yeah because they were  Shot in HD cameras  Yeah they look good  The old ones  They gotta like  Go through frame by frame  Get the speckles out  And everything  Yeah they clean it up too  That's another reason  Do they?  Yeah  Every frame  They clean them up  One frame at a time  You know how long that  That's got a fucking  It's free  Fucking turkey chili  It's so good  I know  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Uh  Hello  I'm waiting 
[03:26:00]  Oh  Kiss  Thank you Opie  You're welcome Anthony  He turned us on  To the turkey chili  I know you're a fan  Of the turkey chili  See this is what  One friend does  To another  I know you gotta give  Him a card  With a hundred dollars  In it  And it's so  And it's so much  Better than that  Turkey chili from  Remember the grease  Stained turkey chili  Man no guy  Oh  Who that guy  Yeah yeah  That fucking soup dude  That fucking soup guy  Oh  That's alright  We get it with your  Fucking schtick  You and your  Closing franchises

[03:27:00]  Except mustard  Creamy mustard  Fucking  Enough with him already  Oh no  If you order the soup  He might yell at you  Uh oh  Look out  He's quite the card  You don't order your soup  Shut up  Faggot  Go get soup somewhere else  Alright  We're not coming back  Exactly  That's what happened  Take your  Fucking  Take your fucking soup  Close the doors  To this failing franchise  Fucking beat it  Back to New York  I have a promotion  Where Kramer yells  At black people  Outside of your store  But then he started 
[03:27:30]  Getting stingy  With his dumb soup  Yeah  We had a good thing  Going with the guy  What happened was  He would bring soup  Every day  Different soups  And we were trying it out  It was called integration  And we would try the soup out  And just naturally talk about it  Yeah  One day he's getting stingy  With the soup  That's right  And all he would send over  Was like pea soup  Like you know he's sending over  The soup that just doesn't sell  Yeah  Instead of the good shit  Because there was turkey chili  That we got a couple of times  And then that stopped  And then there was some other  Like really good  Hearty vegetable kind of soups
