<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, hosted by Primetime Sam Roberts and E-Rock, opened with a rambling, seemingly intoxicated segment of nonsensical speech.  The hosts briefly mentioned introducing a musical band before repeatedly interrupting themselves with "We'll be right back," suggesting numerous commercial breaks or technical difficulties.  Beyond the implied presence of a band, no specific guests were identified during this initial, incoherent portion of the broadcast.  The overall tone was characterized by disjointed and unintelligible conversation.
