<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' typical irreverent banter, complaining about the show itself and the heat. Opie boasted about his rigorous push-up routine.  This segued into a scathing critique of the ending of the comic strip "Kathy," with the hosts and callers describing it as "horrible" and "unfunny," offering crude descriptions of specific strips.  Their disdain extended to other comic strips like "Beetle Bailey," "The Lockhorns," and "Family Circus,"  which they also derided.  A caller, Larry, surprisingly defended "Kathy," providing a synopsis based on his daily readings, much to the hosts' amusement.

The conversation then pivoted to a discussion of Dr. Laura Schlesinger's use of the n-word on her radio show, sparking a lengthy and often offensive debate involving the hosts and callers about the word's context and offensiveness. This discussion included numerous racial slurs and personal anecdotes from the hosts about their own use of the word in different contexts.  They analyzed Dr. Laura's statements and the callers' reactions, further dissecting the media's response to the incident.

The show moved on to other topics including Dr. Laura’s perceived hypocrisy, and a young opera singer accused of lip-syncing.  Tiger Woods’ golf performance, Bubba Watson’s emotional displays (linked to his father's and wife's illnesses), and Phil Mickelson's arthritis were discussed with numerous golf jokes and caller input. This transitioned into a critical discussion of a JetBlue flight attendant who deployed an emergency slide, followed by a tangent about a man who allegedly squirted semen on women using a water bottle. This sparked a debate on racial stereotypes associated with various crimes.  The hosts then launched into an explicit discussion about a woman they found online, detailing her body hair and appearance with sexually charged language, followed by commentary on a porn star's appearance and a misspelled tattoo on Rihanna. They mentioned an upcoming guest: Danielle Staub from *The Real Housewives of New Jersey*, and her daughter, speculating about their appearances and past controversies.  One of the hosts also recounted a dream involving Barack Obama and Michael Douglas.

A significant portion of the show focused on the anticipated interview with Danielle Staub.  Callers expressed their intense dislike for Staub, using highly offensive language to describe her and her behavior on *The Real Housewives of New Jersey*.  They recounted controversies surrounding Staub, including alleged criminal activity, a dubious victimhood claim, and her use of an ex-con named Danny for protection.  Her song was played and met with overwhelmingly negative reactions.  The hosts also discussed *The Expendables*, expressing frustration at their inability to secure interviews with the film's stars, despite previous success with Steve Austin. They speculated on Arnold Schwarzenegger's role. A listener mentioned a positive tweet from Big Mama Prod.  The show then revisited past outrageous stunts, including an attempt to film a live birth in the studio, a man eating live mice, and other incidents documented on E-Rock's Twitter, "OA Photos," discussing images from these events, including pictures of a pregnant woman and a transsexual person's genitals post-operation.  Audio from a past show featuring a man being repeatedly kicked in the testicles by a dominatrix and other women was also played.  Finally, a debate about the BlackBerry Torch smartphone versus the iPhone ensued, devolving into humorous name-calling and banter.

A caller then expressed extreme frustration with Tasker Ford in Rhode Island, a Shelby-certified modification shop, for the prolonged repair of his car. The caller used extensive profanity, suspecting the shop was using his car as a loaner and pointing out additional damage. The hosts and caller speculated about the shop's actions,  making numerous crude jokes. The discussion shifted to a news story about swastikas painted on a Long Island home and a burned car, with the hosts and caller using homophobic and other offensive slurs to discuss the perpetrators and the misidentified ethnicity of the victims.

Danielle Staub then arrived in the studio.  The hosts commented extensively on her appearance, using vulgar language and discussing her past, including cosmetic surgery, drug use, and legal battles, specifically mentioning a defamation lawsuit and an alleged kidnapping incident. Staub discussed the negative media coverage, her strategies for dealing with it, and a sex tape released without her consent. She also detailed her financial struggles due to legal fees.  A lengthy segment covered Staub's disputes with other Housewives, particularly a physical altercation with Jacqueline's daughter. A caller’s attempt to inquire about Staub's daughter's sexuality was immediately shut down. A tense exchange occurred between Staub and a producer, Steve, over his inaccurate claim that she had stripped at a club, resulting in an apology from Steve.

The final segment centered on Danielle Staub promoting her book, *The Naked Truth*, and her sex tape.  The hosts engaged in highly sexually explicit and vulgar conversation with Staub, focusing on the sex tape, her body, and her rumored lesbian relationship, despite her attempts to deflect the questions.  Graphic descriptions of genitalia and sexual acts were included, and the hosts viewed and commented on the sex tape during the interview. A caller, Becky, used a vulgar name for Staub, leading to her removal from the air.  A phone conversation with Brendan from WhatWouldTylerDurtonDo.com discussed legal aspects of celebrity sex tapes and age verification.  The explicit commentary on the sex tape continued after Staub left, with numerous crude and sexually charged remarks about her body.  The show concluded with commercial plugs and further off-color banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  Shut up. Shut your fucking mouth.  This is terrible.  We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend.  This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up. We get it. We get it.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Friday. Holy shit.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  Thank God it's Friday.  Friday.  Friday. 
[00:01:00]  Friday.  How's everybody?  Good.  I was asking the audience. It was kind of rhetorical.  Why don't you start by asking how the people you do the show love.  All right. Opie, how's things?  I'm doing just fine, sir. Thanks for asking.  Good. Jimmy?  Things could be a whole lot better, Lloyd.  Things could be a whole lot better.  It's fucking hot in here, no?  Yeah.  It is blazing. 
[00:01:30]  Because I woke up an hour early and did 100 push-ups? Who cares?  No way.  And now you feel like you're in shape again, right?  You did?  I haven't worked out in a month. I mean, literally just started again yesterday. I'm so depressed.  You started with 100 push-ups?  No, I did 150 last week and I was sore for four days. And then yesterday I did 50 and today I did 100 after I did my cardio.  You should mix it up a little.  Push-ups are good for you, though.  Yeah, they are.  But you've got to work back into it slowly.  100 is not that many. Four sets of 25? 
[00:02:00]  Four sets of 25 over an hour?  A half hour.  Oh, that'll hurt you.  That's going to hurt a little bit.  Yeah, you'll be hurt by it.  I deserve to hurt.  He likes the pain.  It's good to hurt.  Yeah.  Feel the burn. Feel the burn.  Holy shit. We've got a busy show today. Very, very sad news.  Kathy the comic strip will end in October after 34 years.  What?  Didn't that comic strip end about 20 years ago? 
[00:02:30]  Please.  Who the fuck reads Kathy in the comic strip?  What, do they finally show her digging her face into a cartoon muff?  Be the dyke that she is?  Oh, you think that was a lesbian cartoon?  Cartoon doik.  Is it even in our papers?  Sometimes you see it.  Yeah, it's got to be.  Really?  It's got to be.  Uh, why?  Hello?  Hello?  Gregorio.  Hi.  Hello?  Caller.  Hello, caller.  You're on the air.  Oh.  Okay.  How did I do that?  Gregorio hit something.  He leaned over to get the paper, probably.  But then he pushed that button to make it stop. 
[00:03:00]  Wait over there.  Does that keyboard do something for the phone?  Yeah, maybe.  That just scared the shit out of me.  Whoa.  I could do a show with the dial tone in the background the whole day, though.  That would be kind of fun.  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  How did your phone die?  The creator of Kathy basically said she shot himself in the head realizing what he's done  for 36 years or whatever it is.  It's a woman.  Oh, sorry.  And she said that she ran out of creative juice. 
[00:03:30]  In 1977.  Exactly.  Ran out of creative juice?  And she wants to go try something else.  Something else.  The only juice that's worth anything on them.  And I guess the New York paper decided to blow off Kathy many years ago because I don't  see it in this.  Kathy fucking stinks.  Kathy sucks a clit.  What was the big fucking story with Kathy?  I don't fucking know.  Was it always trying to find a date?  Oh, is that it?  Trouble at the office. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, there's Kathy.  Oh, no.  That's right.  That's the face transplant lady.  I got confused for a second.  Old pyramid head.  She's terrible, that lady.  Oh, Easter Island woman.  She's the real life Kathy, though.  Yeah, she is.  She decided to get the Kathy makeover.  Ew.  Can we get the Kathy comic strip online, maybe?  Because it's not in the paper.  I mean, Blondie's in the paper, thank God.  And Doonesbury and Beetle Bailey, thank God.  That can't be the same person writing Blondie still. 
[00:04:30]  There's no way.  Blondie was like in the fucking 40s, I think.  All comic strips should end.  They just, they stink.  Irrelevant.  They're not funny.  Nobody laughs.  I've never seen anybody go like, even reading it.  Never.  No.  Why are they scared to just not do this anymore?  This means the funny papers.  No one would notice.  The funny papers.  Is this Kathy?  All right, it's a picture of a woman.  Yeah, walk us through.  Is this today's strip?  All right, Jim.  Very important considering it's ending in October after 34 years. 
[00:05:00]  A woman in a blue polka dotted shirt, kind of pokey out of a picture frame, with very,  very short gray hair and nose glasses.  Boy, I wonder, is she an old lesbian?  Oh, boy, she has to be.  Old dyke.  And she says, I've told you for years you were taking too many pictures, but you wouldn't  listen.  Next one.  What on earth will you do with so many pictures?  And then here comes the next one.  I guess she's typing this into her computer.  Look at your pretty smile in this one.  Look how your eyes sparkle in this one. 
[00:05:30]  Look at the cute way you turned your head.  Look how lovely you are.  I just want to squeeze you.  And now she's sitting in with two other people, one of whom is Kathy.  Last frame.  Oh, Kathy finally makes an appearance.  And the guy says...  Thanks for throwing us a bone.  When mother says there are too many pictures, she means there are too many pictures of other  things besides her baby.  And then the mother says, are there any more of you?  With hearts around her head.  Like she complained and complained and complained. 
[00:06:00]  What?  I saw any pictures.  Wait, what?  What just happened?  And Kathy doesn't say a word in this one.  What?  Kathy's just standing in the background.  The mother has dementia, obviously.  And what's happened is she shit her pants.  And as the orderly pushes her face into a pillow, she's thinking about Kathy in old  pictures.  Fucking horrible.  What happened?  She ran out of creative juices.  Oh my God.  In the middle of that strip.  But what's the point of the strip?  Dude, I don't get it. 
[00:06:30]  I don't get it.  She's looking at pictures and then what happens?  Who is compelled to read that every day and go like, aha, that's good.  Can't wait till tomorrow.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  The comic strip is an irrelevant feature.  Try one more.  This was yesterday.  Oh, because Kathy's in this one.  Okay.  All right.  We got a big one with Kathy.  Wow.  Kathy is talking in front of a computer monitor.  To what?  Some androgynous thing.  What is that thing he's talking to?  Is that a guy or a girl?  Can't tell.  Wow.  Okay. 
[00:07:00]  Short hair, odd looking.  Kathy says, why did we take 87 shots of the fern outside our vacation hotel room?  And the thing says, why not?  Wait, does she vacation with a woman?  We don't know what that is.  Is this a lesbian cartoon and we just didn't know all these years?  It might be work.  Is Kathy like work at a photography studio?  Maybe.  It says vacation hotel room.  Like they went on vacation.  Outside our vacation hotel room.  That means they were doing some scissoring.  Oh, Kathy scissors. 
[00:07:30]  Just mushing genitals together.  The unsexy sweater she wears every day.  All right, go ahead.  Sorry.  That's right.  The other one says, why not?  Why not?  It's so easy to edit in camera as you go.  And then Kathy says, why don't we ever edit in camera as we, why didn't we ever edit in  camera as we went?  And then thing says, it's easier to edit on the computer each night.  And then Kathy says, why didn't we edit on the computer each night?  And then the thing says, it's easier to edit at home when we have more time. 
[00:08:00]  Ha ha.  Like that will ever happen.  And then Kathy says, all we managed to delete is the possibility that we'd ever delete anything.  And then the other one says, ta-da.  Our first edit.  Holy shit.  It's ungodly.  That sucks.  How bad that is.  That just makes you angry.  I'm mad.  Yes.  I'm mad at how unfunny and just, there's nothing there. 
[00:08:30]  Holy shit.  Do you think the paper gets that?  This is like, wow, she's really lost this.  Now they don't even look at it.  They just put it in.  They put it in and send her a giant check.  This is an art form that has passed everyone by.  It's just gone.  I love the political cartoonists in the post.  I think they say some really fucking, like, poignant shit.  They have one frame to do it.  Yeah, yeah.  Those guys are actually really good.  Those are out of the comic strip section, too.  They're just, you know, they're on editorial pages and things like that.  This is in the comic section.  I don't even know what we just read. 
[00:09:00]  It's horrendous.  What are we getting done there?  I don't know what that is.  I should start my own syndicated comic.  Yes, you should.  And apparently the comics are all available online somewhere, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They all have their own sites.  Why is it even in the paper?  The newspaper could be one page.  Yeah.  Just one page.  The top story, which you don't even need.  Actually, no pages.  None pages.  Yeah, you don't really need fucking newspapers anymore. 
[00:09:30]  The funny paper.  All right, well.  Stolt.  Go spray some DDT on Grandpa.  I guess someone out there is going to miss Kathy.  I don't know who.  Yeah.  I don't know what her audience is.  I would assume old lesbians or something.  Yeah, they think it's...  You know, people like to curl up with a good book.  Wait, Larry in Connecticut wants to...  Larry, are you trying to defend the Kathy comic strip?  Oh.  Look, Kathy is not about anything that you're talking about.  What's it about?  The comic strip, Kathy, is about the struggles of a modern woman who's trying to make her way 
[00:10:00]  in a modern world, trying to deal with issues at work, trying to deal with her issues having to do with her body,  and also bothered by a loving, overbearing mother, a loving, overbearing father, a mischievous dog.  It's just about life for a woman in the modern world.  So you found a synopsis online?  Pardon?  You found a synopsis online, did you?  No, I've read Kathy in the comic strip where I buy the paper every day, just like I read Beetle Bailey and Blondie and Pickles and... 
[00:10:30]  Pickles.  Wait, wait.  I read the comics.  Sir, why do you...  I read the comics.  Why do you read...  Why do you read Beetle Bailey?  Do you get a good laugh out of that, do you?  Could you find Beetle Bailey?  Hold on.  Sometimes I get a real good chuckle out of it because I see people in association with what I soldiered in Beetle Bailey.  All right, listen.  We're going to have an open mind.  We're going to read today's Beetle Bailey for you.  All right.  And then you maybe can explain it. 
[00:11:00]  So hold on the line here.  Yeah.  We'll read Beetle Bailey, and you explain to us why it's funny.  I'm amazed we actually found someone that still reads the comics.  I didn't think that was possible.  A man that reads Kathy.  Where are you?  I thought he was joking.  There's two of you.  Are you joking, Larry?  Are you fucking the woman who draws her?  The little dog, the little dog's always ripping stuff to pieces.  She's always flustered, never can get anything done, is constantly doubting herself.  Just like a dyke.  All right, sir.  All right, here's today's Beetle Bailey. 
[00:11:30]  By the way, in today's Beetle Bailey, Beetle Bailey doesn't even appear.  There's no, Beetle Bailey has the day off.  I think you got the sergeant and the sergeant secretary or something.  Or the general, there's the general.  Oh, that's the general.  I'm sorry, right.  I should have known that.  Yes, of course.  All right, sir.  There's a general, and there's a little blonde girl.  Now, there's a little sign that says, hanging on the wall, today is Formal Friday.  The general says, what is Formal Friday?  I never heard of it.  And then the two of them are in the next strip, and a well-dressed blonde woman, like wearing 
[00:12:00]  an evening gown, walks in and says...  No, no.  Yeah, okay, sorry.  The blonde and the general are there, a blonde with an evening gown walks in, and the army  blonde says, or off the woman who just walked in, it's a chance for Bucks to wear some of  her old prom dresses.  I don't understand that.  You asshole.  You're being a dick.  All right, thank you.  You're just being a dick.  I love this guy.  I love this guy now.  Bucks and Larry rules. 
[00:12:30]  But an asshole, he starts cracking up at that.  I don't know if it makes sense, Steve, don't you not understanding this?  You kind of made a dice fucking thing there.  That was a dice move.  Larry.  Larry, we like you, Larry.  You're the best, Larry.  All right, so officially, we still haven't found anyone that actually reads the comics  every day.  No.  God.  Wow, that's just awful.  The Lockhorns weren't as bad as some.  Lockhorns are from my hometown, so let's be careful. 
[00:13:00]  I used to laugh.  Let's be careful with the Lockhorns.  Reading the Lockhorns when I was like, before I was 12.  Mean guy died, and I think the wife now freaking does the comic strip with some young artists.  They're always mad at each other.  I'm just waiting for a fucking murder-suicide on the Lockhorns.  How great would that be to end that way?  Oh, he just blasts her on the head with a shotgun, puts it in his mouth.  Well, now.  No words.  Now I'm defending the Lockhorns.  Two panels.  But the guy was from the Huntington area, and a lot of Huntington references in the 
[00:13:30]  Lockhorns.  You know what's a great cartoon?  The Far Side.  Not F.A. Trials yet.  That would be nice.  The Lockhorns go there.  He fucking shoves our faces.  Yeah.  Wonderful chicken cutlet.  Oh, it's that other fucking joint they always use.  Fuck.  Language.  From across the street from Book Review.  I forgot the name of that joint.  Does he run into someone's drunken ex-wife?  Go Lockhorns.  Let's see if the Lockhorns is worth reading. 
[00:14:00]  Jimmy, you want to do us a favor?  The Lockhorns.  Are they all single-panel Lockhorns?  I believe so, yeah.  Yeah, I think they were.  All right, here's today's Lockhorns.  This one's not great.  It's them two talking to some marriage counselor, obviously.  Okay.  And they're both back-to-back on one seat, and he said, first, you both need to learn  to compromise.  Oh, because one of them won't take the other seat?  Yeah.  Wow.  I guess they hate each other.  My father used to like these.  Yeah.  And the two of them are standing there, and she's cooking, and he says, when did your  meatloaf become a renewable resource? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, boy, okay.  They're always just bitching at each other.  Oh, go ahead.  He's sitting there looking unshaven and a mess, and she said to somebody, this is Leroy's  retirement plan.  Why don't they just get a divorce?  Exactly.  It's been how many years?  Why don't they just finally let her bed in Negro, which is what she really wants?  And he could prep the ball.  Yeah.  He's a cuckold.  Leroy likes to suck before it goes in.  I can't even read this.  It's just horrible. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  My dad would laugh back in the day.  Yeah, in the old days.  Things used to be entertaining.  There's one where he's all...  Remember Dickie Goodman got fucking radio airplay and laughs.  Yeah, right.  Because there's no relative comparisons.  Right.  Now it's...  What are you looking at?  Hey, we're getting requests now.  Someone goes, can you read Family Circus?  It's precious.  Spectro from Michigan.  Big and black?  Good old Family Circus.  I used to love Jim Norton's fucking comic book. 
[00:15:30]  It just hurt my throat too much.  I love doing that, too.  Oh, yeah.  I understand.  I did like that one, though.  The Family Circus.  All right, let's try The Family Circus.  What's this one about?  Yeah, there's a couple...  There's two or three little kids.  Maybe four little kids.  Little chubby kids.  Yeah, they're little nasty fucking kids.  The Family Circus.  They're all available online.  Let's see.  This is for old people that just don't have computers.  Let me see how to use them.  Let's try The Family Circus.  You've got a dad driving the car. 
[00:16:00]  The daughter.  And the daughter's in the passenger seat.  And the son's in...  He's got the visor.  You can see the shades on his face,  but the son's in her eyes.  Because she's so short.  Right.  And she adorably says,  Daddy, will you move the son, please?  Aw.  Because I guess that's what kids say.  Careens into a pole,  and she flies through the windshield.  Or her brother...  No, no.  Her brother is fucking her in the face,  and she says,  Will you move the son?  Meaning his.  See?  There'd be a lot of lofts with that. 
[00:16:30]  Aw, look at the...  See the kid just...  The boy, he says...  He's holding a piece of paper.  No knot, knee, knob.  Four words written on it,  and he says,  Why do I have to keep writing in these K's  when they don't make any noise anyway?  Aw, it's adorable,  because they're silent.  The little guy.  Kids say that type of stuff.  The darndest things.  Yeah, I love this one.  Take that out of my hiney.  Yeah.  Here's the...  Take that out of my k-hiney. 
[00:17:00]  Take your knuckles out of my hiney.  Someone's going to know what you did.  They're going to have the knowledge.  Very good.  Hey, we go to Tony in Brooklyn really fast.  Tony!  Hey, yeah.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, brother?  I really live in Huntington Bay,  but it's Canterbury Ales,  and they also reference the Golden Dolphin Diner a lot.  There you go, yeah.  Oh, the Golden Dolphin right there on Main.  In the Lockhorns.  They reference a lot of places in Huntington. 
[00:17:30]  Thank you, Tony.  I forgot.  Yeah, I forgot.  It was Canterbury Ales.  Very good.  Didn't know that.  That is correct, yes.  All right.  Didn't go to Canterbury that much.  Went to the Golden Dolphin.  Golden Dolphin.  Yeah.  Do you know how funny the far side was?  How funny was it?  I remember one,  and it was like,  he was a genius, that guy.  It was one...  Gary Larson.  It's a guy,  it's two guys in a plane,  and they're looking down  at a guy obviously on a deserted island,  and he's got rocks,  and the sign is H-E-L-F, 
[00:18:00]  like he didn't finish connecting the P,  and the guy goes,  uh, cancel that.  He doesn't need...  Apparently it's been a mistake.  This guy is saying health.  He doesn't need health.  It was some funny cartoon.  I really ruined it.  No, it was very funny.  I absolutely get that.  The guy wrote health,  and they left it there.  It's okay.  That was...  See, those were the ones  you could get the big calendar of,  and every day you rip off one,  and it's hysterical, funny.  Yeah, but that's why  The Far Side was so great.  It was so much better  than this horse shit  that's still in the papers, 
[00:18:30]  like Kathy.  And he retired.  Kathy goes away in October.  Right on top, he retired, too.  Like, everybody still wanted  more of that shit.  Go to Dwayne Trosley.  T-R-O-S-L-E-Y.  What's...  Who the hell is that?  That's Hustler cartoons.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Those are funny.  They're the funniest cartoons.  Yeah.  I would actually laugh  until it hurt  at some of those.  My favorite one ever  is two hunters staring  at a bear trap,  and there's a pair  of bloody testicles  hanging in the trap, 
[00:19:00]  and the one guy  goes to the other one,  somewhere out there  is one mean fucking bear.  I would frame that night.  That's great.  That really is great.  Look at this fucking mess.  They're just filthy.  That's Bill and I...  No, call...  There's a very old naked guy  in a swing.  And there's an old woman  sucking his dick,  and he's swinging,  and she's attached to his cock,  and they're in midair.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  And the caption is,  we never would have tried  this with your old  denture adhesive.  And she's got a finger  up his ass.  It's just filthy.  And her pussy is flopping out  like a duck's mouth.  It's whistling.  Yeah, because she's old.  What is this one?  Oh.  Guy's on top of a woman  in a bedroom.  Banging her in bed.  And then another woman's  at the doorway all dressed.  Yes, it's Martha Stewart.  Oh, it is?  Okay.  And she says,  Hi, I'm Martha Stewart.  You know,  if you spit on the end  of your dick,  it slides into a dry pussy  much easier. 
[00:20:00]  But she's all proper dressed.  Give me her little tips.  Those are fucking great, man.  What's he doing?  It's a black.  It's a black guy, of course,  with giant lips  and a cock that's  about four feet long  and he has a machine  on the end of it.  And he's reading a book  and on the side  is a box that says  penis reducer on it.  Because black guys  have big dicks.  His dick's giant. 
[00:20:30]  But the machine is humming.  It's just shaving it down.  These are fucking great, man.  Hustler cartoons  are the fucking funniest.  This looks like  some kind of fucking orgy.  Is it all men?  Wait a minute.  All right.  One woman in the middle there.  They're all fucking gangbang.  Yeah.  The guy just walked in.  Yeah.  Guy dressed very nicely  as there's one, two, three, four,  five, six, seven  nude guys and one girl. 
[00:21:00]  And the black guy's  got his dick in her  and there's cum all over.  She's got like  ten loads on her.  They're cum all over.  And the guys are getting dressed.  They're all sitting around the room  and the caption is,  oh no, my wife,  my best friend,  my boss,  my uncle,  my lawyer,  my auto mechanic,  my neighbor,  my accountant,  my dog.  I like the fact  the dog's just sitting there  and apparently he's fucked her too.  Jesus.  I love those.  Yeah, right on.  Fucking great.  I want that,  we go up a little higher.  Can I carry that again?  That's great. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, Chester the molester?  Chester, yeah.  Oh, Chester the molester.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, Mike in St. Louis.  Yes, old Chester the molester.  You know what was a great one?  Chester was standing outside  the bathroom one time  and there was toilet paper  right around the corner  so you knew Chester  had taken the toilet paper  out and hidden it  and he had yellow  and brown on his chin  and there was a little sign  he had made  and it said,  butts expertly cleaned.  Chester was a great.  Chester rules.  I love the fact 
[00:22:00]  they told you  what had happened  just by hiding  the toilet paper  around the corner.  Yeah, that's pretty smart.  A lot of creeps come up  when you put Chester  the molester.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Very hard to get the  comic there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anything come up?  Still get a bunch of  molesters.  Hustler comics,  Hustler comics,  Chester the molester  in quotes probably.  And a kiss.  Just a lot of  a lot of creeps.  A lot of molesters, yeah. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, a lot of real  molesters popping up.  Horrible people.  No.  We can't find any.  I wonder why.  Is that taboo now?  Very greedy with his works.  Having them pulled offline.  Maybe there's a...  Sure.  Blogs about Chester  the molester.  Wow, what's up with this?  I don't know if that's...  Oh, these are just  horrible people.  Wow.  Those are real  like Chester the molesters. 
[00:23:00]  Can't find them.  I don't want  this shit out there, yo.  Huh.  You pay, motherfucker.  Well, with that...  All that from Kathy...  Kathy is leaving us.  In October.  Thank God.  I wonder what they'll fill the...  I love when you learn  one of these, you know,  comic people are leaving us  and then you...  And no one cares.  And then you're in your car  going, I didn't even know  that they were still, uh...  Yeah.  You know, doing fucking comics.  And they're usually, uh... 
[00:23:30]  There's no usual references  to popular culture in them.  So they could probably  just go back...  Oh, yeah.  30 years and just rerun  the fucking things  over again 30 years.  Well, change the storyline  a little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Honestly, all that means  is she's not fucking  doing new ones.  Yeah.  It'll stay in the papers.  Yeah, they'll just recycle them.  Because no one will notice.  Who would go,  I read that Kathy  20 years ago.  Right.  No one's going to notice. 
[00:24:00]  That was a Ziggy.  We got to get, uh...  We're going to change  gears drastically,  but Dr. Laura...  I have to hear this...  Wow, wow, wow.  She loves the editor.  Dr. Laura...  Um...  No.  This is all over  the fucking life.  Steve!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that, uh...  If you're going to say nigger,  you should, uh...  Keep it in context.  Uh...  Yeah, the dieticulitis  was caused by, uh... 
[00:24:30]  Dr. Steve.  He rules.  Let's just wake him up.  Decapitate him.  Monday, let's wake him up  at 6.02.  Really make him miserable  for the day.  With an inane question.  Yeah, with something  really just stupid.  Yeah.  Dr. Laura takes a phone call  from Jade,  who's in an interracial  relationship and has a problem.  Boo!  Boo!  This got Laura...  Dr. Laura Schlesinger...  Schlesinger... 
[00:25:00]  To say the N-word a lot.  Yeah.  It started with this.  Jade, welcome to the program.  Hi, Dr. Laura.  Hi.  I'm having an issue  with my husband  where I'm starting to grow  very resentful of him.  I'm black and he's white.  Uh...  We've been around  some of his friends  and family members  who start make...  who start making racist comments  as if I'm not there  or if I'm not black  and my husband ignores  those comments  and it hurts my feelings. 
[00:25:30]  And then he just acts like...  Well, can you give me  an example of a racist comment?  Because sometimes  people are hypersensitive.  So, tell me what's...  Give me two good examples  of racist comments.  Okay.  Last night,  good example.  We had a neighbor come over  and this neighbor...  Every time he comes over  it's always a black comment.  It's, oh, well,  how do you black people  like doing this  and do black people  really like doing that?  And for a long time  I would ignore it.  But last night  I got to the point...  I don't think that's racist.  Well, the stereotype... 
[00:26:00]  I don't think that's racist.  No, I think that...  How about the stereotype?  No, no, no.  Oh.  I think that's...  Well, listen.  Without giving much thought,  a lot of blacks voted for Obama  simply because he was half black.  Didn't matter  what he was going to do in office.  It was a black thing.  You've got to know that.  It's really boring.  Let me tell you something  about Laura.  First of all, I hate her.  Yeah.  I hate her guts  and I love the fact  that Stern had those  fucking pictures  of her fucking pussy  put up years ago. 
[00:26:30]  The greatest kicking  of somebody off a pedestal ever.  She's a fucking...  As much as I would...  I don't want to see her fire  but that woman called up  and said,  my husband...  The woman is saying  is, look,  this is my husband's friend.  I'm his wife.  Every time the guy comes over  he addresses my race.  Right.  That woman has a point.  That would be annoying.  Yeah, it would get annoying.  Of course it would.  Like, she's...  It's like, I'm the guy's wife.  I fucking...  I'm here every day.  Oh.  And he's coming over  and addressing her race. 
[00:27:00]  It'd be like...  Yeah, look at her.  Like, Laura has a nice  long pussy, too.  Look at that big  fucking hairy muff.  Well, she had youth  on her side  when that picture  was taken.  But Laura...  You can tell Laura's  got a weird thing.  Like, and of course  media matters when after her.  You know, I just hate them.  Right.  But I think that...  I think Laura's a fucking...  She doesn't know  how to fucking deal with this.  Yeah, like,  why did she just dismiss it  so quickly?  That's not racist.  That's not...  It might not be racist,  but it's annoying to the woman 
[00:27:30]  and should be addressed  more so than just  blowing it off  like she did.  Yeah, that's not unreasonable  for the woman  to want to be in her house  with her husband  and every time  this guy comes over  he asks about black people.  Maybe it's not racist,  but it's racial.  It's annoying.  It sounds like it happens  more than one person  is doing this to her, too.  Yeah, I'd have slammed her  back then.  Huh?  Yeah, of course you would have.  With her big fucking  dumb tan lines  and her...  Of course.  Big muff.  Yeah, I'm so happy  that happened to her, though.  Her pussy don't look  like that nowadays.  Ah, no. 
[00:28:00]  She should be happy  those pictures are out there.  She's enragingly goody-two-shoes.  She's a fucking know-it-all.  She's a bore to listen to.  Anyway, that started it  and now we ramp up here.  Not everything that somebody says...  We had friends over  the other day.  Got about 35 people here.  The guys were going to  start playing basketball.  I was going to go out  and play basketball.  My bodyguard and my dear friend  is a black man.  And I said,  white men can't jump.  I want you on my team.  That was racist? 
[00:28:30]  That was funny.  How about the N-word?  The N-word's been thrown around.  Black guys use it all the time.  Turn on HBO,  listen to a black comic  and all you hear is  nigger, nigger, nigger.  I don't get it.  If anybody without enough melanin  says it,  it's a horrible thing.  But when black people say it,  it's affectionate.  It's very confusing.  Don't hang up.  I want to talk to you some more.  Don't go away.  That's into a journey song.  Been so long.  She makes a good point there.  Her point there is okay, 
[00:29:00]  but it was like  this woman wasn't saying that.  No, no, no.  It wasn't like this woman said,  you know what?  Someone said the word nigger  and then Dr. Laura said,  what about black comedians?  Well, that's different.  She didn't say that.  It was like...  No.  Right.  She just threw that out there  for no reason.  Yeah.  It's like she wanted to have  an excuse to say it.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  I'll give it to her.  Oh, Jesus.  Just drive on the West Side Highway.  After her journey song,  the discussion continued.  Oh.  What song was that?  Faithfully? 
[00:29:30]  No, no.  Say goodbye.  Send her my love.  All right.  I think it's called  Send Her My Love.  And then after that,  she came back  to talk to this woman some more.  Yeah.  I think you have  too much sensitivity  and not enough sense of humor.  Oh, it depends how it's said.  Is it okay to say that word?  Is it ever okay to say that word?  It depends how it's said.  Black guys talking to each other  seem to think it's okay.  But you're not black. 
[00:30:00]  They're not black.  Oh, I see.  So a word is restricted to race.  Got it.  Can't do much about that.  I can't believe someone like you  is on the radio  spewing out the nigger word  and I hope everybody heard it.  I didn't spew out the nigger word.  Nigger, nigger, nigger.  Right.  I said that's what you hear.  Everybody heard it.  Yes, they did.  I hope everybody heard it.  They did and I'll say it again.  Nigger, nigger, nigger  is what you hear on HB.  Why don't you let me finish a sentence? 
[00:30:30]  Okay.  Don't take things out of context.  Don't double NAACP.  Leave them in context.  And I know it came from a white person  and I know the white person made it bad.  Thank you very much.  She's really,  Dr. Laura is really annoying to listen to.  But she's got a great point.  I do have a butt.  But she's making great points.  She is,  but she's making them from a weird place.  She's not,  it's like that wasn't what this woman called up and said.  It's almost like if this woman had called up and said,  look,  someone,  a white man said the word nigger 
[00:31:00]  and I don't like it.  And then she would have said,  well,  does it offend you if Chris Rock says it?  No.  Then to me,  that's this discussion.  But this woman just said it's annoying  when these guys come over  and his fucking family's always making racial remarks  and it gets to be irritating.  And then she made it into this,  which had nothing to do with it.  Yeah,  this totally changed.  This has nothing to do with the,  what the caller was talking about.  Absolutely.  You know something though?  We've been in situations  where the conversation gets a little dynamic  and changes subjects in the middle of it.  So I'm not even going to falter on that.  The thing is, 
[00:31:30]  once the subject changed,  she was absolutely right.  The context she used it in was fine  because she's just describing what you hear.  She wasn't blurting it out  in any offensive way.  She was describing what you hear.  And this woman got completely offended.  She could say it.  She had no problem saying it.  She's talking about black people being able to say it,  but Dr. Laura couldn't say it.  Dr. Laura.  Dr. Laura's like,  fuck you.  No,  no,  here's what bugs me about that.  And if that woman had said that, 
[00:32:00]  I would agree with Laura.  But she didn't.  Dr. Laura was the one who raised that point,  saying,  you see black guys,  and then the woman's like,  well,  you're not black.  She was reacting to Laura saying that.  And the woman even said,  is it right for anybody to say it?  Is it right to ever say it?  Like,  she was basically saying that nobody should say it.  Laura brought in,  well,  the black,  Laura was being fucking phony there,  man.  I'm telling you.  You think?  Yes.  It was an excuse to say nigger.  It was an excuse to get that off her chest.  It was not organic.  That should not have gone that way.  Because that's not what the woman was talking about.  I don't think the woman said that the neighbor said the N word. 
[00:32:30]  or that it was,  and the woman wasn't getting on a soapbox about blacks can say it and whites can't.  It was only when Laura raised that,  and the woman goes,  well,  you're not black.  And then she goes,  oh,  okay,  so it's,  it was just something very forced about it.  Dr. Laura's one more clip here.  People are going to say,  okay,  what do blacks think?  What do whites think?  What do Jews think?  What do Catholics think?  Of course,  there isn't a one think,  per se,  but in general, 
[00:33:00]  there's think.  And what I just heard from Jade is a lot of what I hear from black think.  And it's really distressing and disturbing.  And to put it in its context,  she said the N word,  and I said on HBO,  listening to black comics,  you hear nigger,  nigger,  nigger.  I didn't call anybody a nigger.  Nice try,  Jade.  Actually,  sucky try.  She just wants to get away with saying it. 
[00:33:30]  She wants to get away with saying it.  She's not fucking trying to be funny.  It's not helping the discussion at all.  It's coming from a really weird place.  It's a weird fuck.  She's a repressed white bitch  who probably would love to say that  and be the white girl who could say it  around her big black bodyguard.  Look at how fucking phony she was.  Go on,  take on the day.  And there's pictures of her cunt all over the internet,  which she denied.  Which she denied.  To me,  that's a fucking phony,  man.  Great.  Like a bush.  I just think that she's extraordinarily phony.  Yeah?  I think so.  Yes.  I agree with Jimmy. 
[00:34:00]  So what does the media do with this clip?  I'm taking the other side of this.  I shouldn't do anything with it.  Well,  they're all over it.  Of course they are.  She shouldn't be penalized for it.  No,  there's no,  she's allowed to say what she said.  She's an absolute freedom of speech issue right there.  I agree.  I agree with you.  That isn't used to incite.  It's not used.  Whatever her motive is,  she pulled it off brilliantly.  If she wanted to say it,  she said it without setting herself up for a big fall.  I disagree.  I think that she fucked up because it was to me, 
[00:34:30]  and dude,  I'm never against people saying what they want to say.  But to me,  just hearing that,  when I read the transcript,  I was like,  that's something weird because it's not what that lady was saying.  It isn't,  but the point is we've been on radio long enough to know that the point changes depending on anything.  You could,  the subject changes fucking 90 degrees in a second on radio.  So even though she didn't really address the woman's point,  which was that,  you know,  she goes, 
[00:35:00]  people come over and,  and it's always black this,  black that,  you know,  whatever.  She did bring up the point that she felt things were racist when friends came over,  and that kind of goes hand in hand with using racial epithets.  Let me,  let me ask you,  when she said,  this is what bugged me about the clip.  The woman raised,  I thought was a legitimate point.  That would get annoying for any,  if you're white and your wife is black and her family,  because I hear that when you're white and you're married to a black,  a black woman,  they're fucking,  the blacks are terrible with that stuff.  Why would your family come over anymore?  Well,  her family.  Oh. 
[00:35:30]  Just to boo your little white dick.  Boo.  But,  she was saying that it's,  and immediately,  Dr. Laura doesn't say to her,  well,  have you tried talking to this guy?  Yeah.  Or have you addressed,  she goes,  well,  what do you mean by racist?  Like,  she's immediately challenging the idea.  Right.  It's like,  why?  I'll give you that.  Yeah,  she did.  That's where,  to me,  it's coming from somewhere weird.  It's not like the woman said,  this guy came over and asked me a question about black people that he's a racist.  She said it happens every time he comes over.  It's black people this and black people that. 
[00:36:00]  Yes,  every time.  So she's saying it's consistent,  which makes it at least racially annoying,  if not racist.  That's where it comes from a bad place.  I think Dr.  Laura could have got a little more info from the caller,  too.  She jumped way into the discussion without,  you know,  getting a little deeper into what this woman was getting at.  She wanted an excuse to go where she went,  because here's what tells you that,  because she goes,  what do you mean by that?  Give me an example.  Give me two examples of racial comments.  Make sure you're not too sensitive.  No matter what that woman said,  unless it was,  you're an ugly nigger,  unless it was something that obvious,  Dr.  Laura would have taken the direction she took. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  That fucking,  she keeps showing your pussy on the internet,  Dr.  Laura.  That's what you should be doing.  She wanted an excuse to say nigger to a black person.  She's not,  she doesn't do that kind of show.  Fuck her.  Hold on.  Buzzard noticed something in this.  Buzzard,  Louisiana.  Yeah,  I think your phone sucks,  brother.  He wanted to say that Dr.,  caller on Dr.  Laura mentioned the N-word first.  Oh,  did she?  I don't know. 
[00:37:00]  She did,  but it was the direction of where the call was going.  I know she did actually mention the N-word.  This guy's going to explain why it's okay for black people to use the N-word.  All right.  Calvin,  Long Island.  Oh,  sorry.  Hey,  what's going on,  guys?  First,  I just want to let you know,  I just got serious XM like two weeks ago.  I love your show.  I listen to it all the time.  Thank you.  Damn.  Thank you,  sir.  Thank you,  sir.  Tell the boss.  My explanation,  I'm a black man.  Let me explain to you why it's okay for black people to use the N-word.  First,  it's like,  imagine you and your friend,  you call each other names, 
[00:37:30]  like,  hey,  asshole,  dick,  whatever,  you know,  imagine somebody else on the outside calls you that.  It's not cool when they call you that.  You don't know that.  Right.  So,  the way,  it's like a little fraternal thing,  like you and your friends calling each other N-word,  being black people.  Hey,  my nigga,  what's up,  what's up?  It's cool.  It's like a brotherly thing.  A white guy says it means something totally different because of the history of the word.  But does it mean something totally different now?  Yeah,  why does it have to mean something different if a white guy says it?  History,  because look at the word gay,  used to mean happy,  and now it means homosexual. 
[00:38:00]  So,  so,  didn't the word change over the years?  Do you honestly think a white person using the word,  and not in a hateful way,  but describing maybe something they saw,  or just without being inciting?  Oh,  I saw some niggas around the corner,  that's cool.  Yeah,  the white guy might be saying it without hate behind it.  This guy said,  it's just really, 
[00:38:30]  being a black man,  it comes off just totally different.  Like,  you have Patrice O'Neill on the show,  ask him how he feels about it.  Like,  I haven't listened to him.  He wouldn't give a shit.  I don't know,  this guy says,  explained it well,  the way we joke with each other,  it feels different coming from someone else.  So,  to me,  there was a street justice with that.  If you said nigger to the wrong guy,  the street justice was,  he's going to punch you in the fucking face for it.  Absolutely.  That's,  to me,  that's the way it should be.  And I have some,  I have some white friends that,  you know,  I guess,  with just,  you know,  hip hop and everything,  some white guy thing,  it's cool,  they,  my nigga,  and like,  you know, 
[00:39:00]  I know them,  so I know they don't mean it like that,  but still,  I feel like they're being like,  it's like posers,  just trying to sit in sometimes,  and say that.  It's corny.  It's still a little offensive,  but the main thing is,  like I said,  you and your friends,  you hang out,  you call each other names,  bitch pussy,  whatever,  I'll kick your ass.  Somebody you don't know totally comes up and says,  hey,  bitch,  now you want to fight,  right?  That's not cool.  See,  I don't know you,  so why would you say that to me?  Calvin,  it's a pretty famous story on this show,  but I got knocked out for saying the N-word on a basketball court,  and, 
[00:39:30]  Oh,  God.  No,  but I was,  I was hanging out with these guys very closely all the time,  and I felt like I could say it because they were saying it,  and I,  there was no hate behind,  behind it when I said it on the basketball court,  and I was,  I got punched in the face,  and I was down on the ground.  Maybe officially not knocked out,  but I was fucking dazed pretty good.  Well,  now,  some friends of mine that do say,  like,  if it bothers me,  I'll be like,  hey,  like,  chill with that,  relax,  like,  you know,  you don't have to say that,  and they'll respect that, 
[00:40:00]  but,  you know,  somebody I don't know totally says that.  No,  this guy knew,  he was a friend of mine at the time,  and I felt like,  because I was kind of,  you know,  in that,  in that culture,  that basketball culture,  and hanging out with these guys,  I felt like I was one of them.  I really did at the time.  I was,  I was four,  what was I,  15,  16,  something like that,  and I said it,  and I said it,  and there was no hate behind it whatsoever,  and I got,  you know,  and I,  I got,  I got punched.  Yeah,  well,  I also got to say,  see,  I don't know the voice just yet,  so who is it?  Is that Opie or is that?  That's Opie. 
[00:40:30]  Opie,  yeah.  Yeah,  Opie,  that would be Anthony.  Yeah,  that would be Anthony.  I talked about blaming stuff  when a knee grow and all,  and I'm like,  oh my goodness.  Ah,  well,  once you learn,  once you learn,  uh,  uh,  the show a little more,  because you're,  you're new to the show,  and we appreciate you as a listener,  sir,  you'll realize that I am a complete  and utter racist,  uh,  horrible human being,  and, 
[00:41:00]  uh,  it just has to be accepted.  And also,  um,  uh,  that show Louie,  I love it,  I forgot the other guy's name,  and I started watching that show,  I love that show.  Oh,  Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah,  Jim,  you guys crack me up,  I'm telling you,  I'm a teacher,  so I'm off for the summer,  but I just wake up,  I wake up at six in the morning,  just to turn on the series,  and listen to you guys,  I'm kind of like,  that's cool,  man.  Thanks a lot,  man.  Thank you.  All right,  Calvin.  Thank you,  brother.  Thanks,  brah.  All right.  I hope my explanation helped you a little bit about how,  like,  it's like an inside thing.  That was a good way of,  Yeah,  you made a good point.  It was a good way of explaining it, 
[00:41:30]  because it wasn't like,  But I don't think white guy,  all white guys are saying the word with hate behind it,  that's all.  That was the point I was trying to make,  but,  you know,  the consequences in my life was I got punched in the face,  like Jimmy was saying,  you know,  that's the consequences.  I also think there's some phoniness going on when the word is used in,  in not hateful,  but a confrontational way.  When somebody does you wrong,  all you want to do is hurt them as much as you can verbally first,  and hopefully it doesn't escalate, 
[00:42:00]  but if a black guy fucks you over somehow,  you're going to fucking at least think the word,  if not blurt it out as a white person.  I don't care how liberal you are or anything.  If a black guy comes up and is fucking with you in some way,  shape,  or form,  you're going to use the word and not in a pleasant way.  And me being a black man,  I know like,  you know,  I know not every white guy's race.  I have a lot of white friends.  I'm telling you,  if they,  I'm sure if they were in a situation with a black guy and they got pissed off  enough,  I know that N word is going to come flying out sooner or later. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  It's,  it's the atom bomb.  Is it,  is it frustrating that you guys don't have a word for white people to really  piss them off?  Not really.  Yes,  they do neighbor.  The worst N word.  That's the thing.  The N word.  I know like I think that,  like that's in their arsenal and you know,  cause black guys don't say that.  I call somebody like,  you know,  powder right here or something.  It doesn't have to come.  Yeah,  I gotta tell you about that.  Hold on,  that N word thing.  That's the big mistake they made because now everyone is saying N word all over the 
[00:43:00]  fucking place.  And you know what N word.  You know what it means.  You know what it means.  It conjures up the word in your head.  It allowed so many more people to say the word without saying it.  If that makes sense.  I don't remember.  I'm on satellite and I can actually curse.  I'm still keeping it a little clean.  Yeah,  you can.  But when you see the news and all going on the N word,  you'll see it all day with Laura Schlesinger.  Oh,  she's used the N word.  These people can't wait to say the N word on TV now.  I know.  I see another thing.  Like if I'm in a confrontation and the white guy does say, 
[00:43:30]  even though I'm pissed and in rage,  I still try to act like it doesn't hurt me.  Cause then he feels like he's empty.  He doesn't have nothing.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  I love it.  I love chicken.  I love watermelon.  So what?  What else you got?  You know,  I don't like watermelon,  but I love chicken.  Just tell him,  just tell him that though.  I think,  you know what?  The fried chicken thing is weird because I think every human being.  Fried chicken is wonderful.  Love fucking fried chicken.  God,  that shit's delicious.  I can't defend the watermelon thing,  but the fried chicken,  there's a lot of white people that love their fried chicken, 
[00:44:00]  man.  I don't like watermelon.  I really don't.  I really don't.  I fucking hate watermelon.  I love it.  It's absolutely disgusting,  but the fried chicken,  everybody loves fried chicken.  Of course they do.  Come on.  I mean,  besides the black men,  them Chinese people know how to fry some chicken.  I'm sorry.  Black people love that.  If I didn't give a shit about myself,  I would eat fried chicken every fucking day.  I know.  Simple as that.  Popeyes,  motherfucker.  Yeah.  Get me a bucket.  I just wanted to say one more time,  you guys are great.  I love it how I got through to the show in like 10 minutes  and then I have to wait an hour on the phone.  Oh,  God, 
[00:44:30]  a new listener.  He's,  he's an ethnic gentleman.  Go away.  We're really having our demo.  Go get your bucket in,  sir.  Thank you.  James in DC.  James.  Yeah,  I used to live out in Long Beach,  California,  back when Rodney King lives and stuff were going on.  I had some black friends.  Uh-oh.  No,  you didn't.  Not with that accent.  Yeah.  Go ahead,  sir.  I'm sorry.  I used to sit around and smoke weed with them.  And,  uh,  I,  I don't understand what Opie's saying about getting lost in the culture, 
[00:45:00]  but you get real comfortable with them when your friends are hanging around.  They start throwing around,  nigger this,  nigger that.  And then before long,  you forget who you are because you're in that.  Yeah.  And I just got comfortable with saying it.  And in,  in,  in,  in the house,  when we were sitting around,  you could say it.  But we went out like around the corner of the 7-Eleven playing Mortal Kombat or something.  And,  you know,  you get excited when somebody does good and go, 
[00:45:30]  way to go,  nigger.  You know,  right.  And I forgot who was around me.  And there were other black guys that weren't in that group that we were in.  And they kind of looked at me like,  what'd you say?  And I'm just like,  uh-oh.  And then I realized I was white.  You just realized you were white.  Jesus.  Oh,  shit,  I'm white.  That's funny.  Were you all on the dance floor when this happened?  Right.  That's funny.  Look,  I heard so much.  I didn't think the word was so powerful. 
[00:46:00]  You know what I mean?  How they were just throwing it around at the time.  And I didn't know shit back then.  And you're 14,  15 is different too.  I didn't know shit.  It's like you're much easier to fall into a group and do as they do.  It's a different mentality when you're that young.  Yeah.  But adults,  it's a weird thing,  man.  It's like one of my favorite,  Eddie Murphy said something so brilliant one time.  It was him and Dick Cavett.  And Dick Cavett was asking him about that word.  And Dick Cavett just looked at him and went,  nigger.  Like,  what is that word?  And Eddie just lapsed into this,  making fun of Dick Cavett. 
[00:46:30]  He goes,  you see that?  I said it right to him.  He didn't even do nothing.  Like,  it was some goof on what Cavett had really done there.  Uh-huh.  And he called him out.  It went beyond the interview.  Wow, yeah, yeah.  It was funny,  but it was like,  people can read your motives.  I say it on stage.  I've been talking about Mel Gibson.  And I've been saying it,  quoting him,  because you're going to get raped by a pack of niggers.  And I'm talking about how annoying it is that people focused on the racial epithet  when he's obviously not a racist.  He was just trying to hurt somebody.  And I think people in the audience can feel...  Do you get some oohs?  Not really,  because it gets silenced. 
[00:47:00]  So then I explain myself why I'm saying it.  It's not to be shocking.  It's just,  why do we care that this guy said this is private?  Like, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  There's a point to it.  But if you're just saying it to be gratuitous,  and just because you want to get away with it,  you're a dick.  Yeah, that,  that and it,  when you're trying to incite somebody into,  you know,  something,  uh,  yeah,  those are the two ways  where it should piss people off.  Uh,  but if you're using it in context,  like you do on stage,  there's no fucking problem with it.  I would argue,  if anyone was offended at it, 
[00:47:30]  I would argue the point  and not be embarrassed that I had said it  or not feel like,  oh no,  no.  That to me is where it's,  it's legit,  because my motive isn't to go,  uh,  let me say it in front of a couple of,  but...  Not saying it,  by the way,  isn't going to make it go away.  No.  It hasn't for many years,  uh,  to make it so taboo and this,  people still use it,  believe me.  I've seen,  I've been in groups of,  uh,  white people  and there hasn't been a,  nary a black person around.  Yeah.  And I've heard that word a lot. 
[00:48:00]  I've been alone in a room  and heard...  Echoing off those walls.  Watching television.  But Media Matters will go after her,  like they would have to,  I miss their fucking pigs.  Yeah,  it's going to be all over the place,  as much as I don't like Dr. Laura,  she,  she was fine with that whole fucking thing.  Her motive was a little weird and all,  but...  Yeah,  I think,  I think that she's just a little  repressed white girl  who probably likes black on blonde porn.  But that's...  Ah.  That's...  It was fine,  whatever.  It, 
[00:48:30]  I,  God.  You know that pint-sized opera singer  we were talking about yesterday?  She's everywhere now  from,  Yeah.  America's Got Talent.  Mm-hmm.  Now everyone is trying to,  trying to say she was lip syncing.  Lip syncing.  And she just wasn't lip syncing.  Have a great weekend for me.  Oh,  that's...  She's lip syncing.  Yeah.  You could tell,  like...  She's taking the world by storm.  And get the,  like,  that tremolo she got in her voice,  and you see,  like,  her jaw and throat  are moving to that. 
[00:49:00]  That would be very difficult.  But everyone's blogging,  saying she was absolutely lip syncing.  Just fucking scumbag bloggers.  It's fake.  Right, right.  I saw it.  Was she lip syncing or no?  No.  Absolutely not.  She's 10 years old,  and we got a Susan Boyle situation on our hands.  Ugly bitch.  This 10-year-old is gonna fucking take on the world now, man.  Doesn't she already have, like, songs out?  I don't know.  Yeah.  And he was looking at some shit yesterday.  Yeah, she's been doing this, uh...  She started singing two years ago. 
[00:49:30]  Really?  She's 10.  She's just a prodigy.  She absolutely is, huh?  But we got a Susan Boyle situation, absolutely.  I didn't want to fuck Susan Boyle.  Yeah.  The world is just eating this little fucking girl up  and how she sounds like a 30-year-old opera fucking star.  All right, why don't we take our first break?  Mmm, sandwich.  Time to do some eating.  Yeah.  And we'll continue.  We'll be right back. 
[00:50:00]  I like you.  You can come over to my house and fuck my sister. 
[00:50:30]  Obi and Anthony.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  Tiger Woods off to a good start.  Yeah, now what the fuck is this about?  Had a horrendous tournament last week,  and he shot one under yesterday in the PGA Championship.  Three shots off the lead.  Looking really good.  It's nice to walk into.  Looking really good.  Thanks.  Well, you did your 100 push-ups.  You're looking really good.  Yes.  I should have done more, but I said I didn't want to push it. 
[00:51:00]  I'll do more later this afternoon.  There you go.  I hear you should lay off a day.  That's like what I hear.  It's true.  Exercise, lay off a day.  Exercise, lay off a day.  Yeah, the push-ups you can do.  I think you can do some push-ups every day.  Yeah, because it rips down your muscles a little when you're exercising,  and then you get a day to build them back up.  Yeah, you need your body to recover a little bit.  Yeah.  I take off a month.  My body's recovered.  Okay, you can do a few days in a row. 
[00:51:30]  Jimmy's like balls out.  All or nothing gym, they call it.  If I do a couple of days of push-ups,  my body is going to all of a sudden not get...  My body is like just anything you want to do.  Atrophy.  Do something.  Dude, I'm like a piece of...  It's screaming, do something.  Just fucking do something.  I'm like a fat piece of wood in a petrified forest.  You're strangling me.  Do something.  Ah, shit.  I guess the headline with the Tiger Woods thing really fast in.  Yeah.  We got this Bubba Watson who likes crying.  Holy shit. 
[00:52:00]  Go down there.  Travis, do you know why he was crying this time?  No, I don't.  You know, I miss him.  Everyone, write at me on Twitter.  You've got to play the audio of Bubba Watson crying.  He's the clubhouse leader at the PGA Championship after the first day.  Four-day tournament for the people that don't know.  And I think he's going through some personal stuff.  And he's been blubbering, man.  He's blubbering, this Bubba Watson.  His dad's fighting cancer.  His wife had a cancer scare.  And, you know, now he's doing really good in golf.  Jeez.  It's cool.  So he's hitting the ball in the hole. 
[00:52:30]  That helps their cancer how?  Yeah, well, I hate to.  You know, you're right, Jimmy.  How does that help the cancer?  Yeah.  You know, my father, he's probably not going to be around much longer.  So I better win this golf tournament before he dies of cancer.  The ball was on the grass, and I took the stick, and I hit it.  It only took me two hits with the stick to make it in the hole.  Gives a fuck.  Why are you simplifying it?  In a way, that makes complete sense. 
[00:53:00]  Golf is very important for a lot of people, Jimmy.  You see Jack Nicklaus?  100 feet.  Sicken that 100-foot putt yesterday?  Yeah, 100-foot putt.  It was some kind of demonstration, obviously.  He doesn't really play anymore.  That's pretty impressive.  Not in the big tournaments.  So Tiger's right in there.  Yeah.  We'll see what happens.  And Phil Mickelson, it came out, he's got arthritis.  What?  35-year-old.  How old is he?  He's probably pushing 40 at this point.  Yeah.  He's got arthritis.  Arthritis?  Do we have the Bubba Watson audio? 
[00:53:30]  We don't have it today?  He needs bee stings.  We learned that yesterday.  We sure did learn that.  He needs to be stung by a bee.  Well, you can't get stung on a golf course, so that's perfect.  On a golf course?  Go in the woods, make believe you're looking for your ball, and get some bee stings to  take care of the arthritis.  Wow, that sucks.  I would guess golf is a game you really kind of don't want arthritis in.  No.  Since everything is moving when you hit the ball.  You need to be able to feel.  It's a game of touch.  Wow, that's a bitch, man. 
[00:54:00]  That's a bitch.  Is he talking about how long he'll be able to play or anything like that?  Is he hinting about quitting?  He'll have to quit the game.  I was listening to the PGA Network on Sirius XM.  Oh.  Holy shit, what a bore fest, unless you're into golf like myself.  Well, yeah.  It's niche programming, they call it.  I can't imagine the average radio listener is stopping by the PGA channel for more than  two seconds.  Oh, will they bore you to death? 
[00:54:30]  And they're saying that Phil needs to figure out his food and medicine thing.  It's a balance.  Oh, really?  He's got to figure out, yeah, how to balance that out.  And then he'll be just fine on the golf course.  Yeah.  So, I'm just stalling because I was hoping we could get the Bubba Watson audio.  We don't have it, huh?  Bubba Watson.  No.  Travis, what young golfer do you want to win the PGA Championship?  We might as well go with this bit we started last week.  Hunter?  Hunter Mahan? 
[00:55:00]  I like Hunter Mahan, but as I said last week, I'm a big Rory McElroy fan now.  Oh, who isn't, right?  I'm enjoying what this young kid can do.  Is it Ryan Moore?  Ryan Moore?  I'm not sure.  There's a guy, I think he's right in there, Ryan Moore, and then he kind of talked after  his round.  Oh, really?  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah, he's young.  Oh, boy.  He's 27.  27?  Oh, you said that like, wow.  No, it makes sense.  Oh, he's 27. 
[00:55:30]  No, it's like, this kid's 27, and he's won back on the PGA Championship, and I'm 29,  and I'm just wishing I could be, you know.  Aw.  Here's Bubba.  68, but I stayed focused on every hole and just somehow plotted along and shot 68.  Made some key putts to keep me at 60, to keep me under par all day.  You know, you're going to make some bogeys somewhere.  I made a couple bad swings, cost me a bogey here and there, but other than that, it was  a great day, and any day you can shoot 68 in a major, it's a great day. 
[00:56:00]  Uh, I hit the ball pretty well today.  I hit the ball pretty well.  You know, I hit the ball pretty well.  Jimmy, comment.  The guy had a couple bogeys in there.  I don't know what a bogey is, but I mean, I don't mind a guy being happy about his golf  game.  It's what he does for a living.  But, um, you know.  A bogey's one over par.  Oh, is that bad?  So if a hole is like a par four, he shot a five.  As opposed to good.  You literally could have just said that in Spanish, and I'd have the same amount of  understanding. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, speaking of bogeys.  Yes, Kenny.  You were talking about golf and bee stings?  Yeah.  One time I played golf, and I was in the clubhouse, and this lady came in screaming that she got  stung by a bee.  I tried to help her.  I said, where?  She said, between the first and the second hole.  I said, your stance is too wide.  I want to boo him, but I've always loved that joke.  I knew it was coming a mile away. 
[00:57:00]  Golf humor rules.  What told you that something was coming when he said, I was in the golf clubhouse?  What are you doing?  Fucking hitting a perp with a fucking nine iron?  A little interrogation.  Right.  Oh, I wanted to boo that joke.  That's a classic.  Do you have any other golf jokes?  No, no.  No?  We could do a whole second.  How about this?  Do you have any golf jokes?  All right, what are we going to do with this tiger thing?  Whatever.  I was hoping for the audio. 
[00:57:30]  Maybe the guys will find it.  Can I praise somebody that we usually kill?  Ooh.  I've been on a Marlon Brando, just loving Marlon Brando tear, just watching interviews  and stuff with him, because he's such a coup.  He was.  What do you mean?  We don't kill him.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's already dead.  No, no, not Brando, but Larry King's interview with him in 94, I re-watched.  Larry used to be the greatest.  Oh, in 94.  What a great interview he did.  Yeah, in 94, Larry was relevant.  Brando was a very, very tough interview.  He's all, and Larry was focusing him, and Larry was not afraid of him. 
[00:58:00]  And I watched Dick Cavett, who, Dick Cavett was the master.  I mean, he interviewed fucking Hendrix and Lennon and everybody.  Larry was a better interviewer than fucking Dick Cavett.  Cavett was.  When they were both in their prime.  Cavett was nervous.  Brando, he was a 73.  Brando still looked like the Godfather.  Oh, wow.  A little extra weight.  It was his last tango in Paris.  And he just came out, and literally, minutes went by when he said nothing.  Like, he was just a really tough guy to fucking talk to.  I bet.  Wasn't the Larry King interview where he tried on his slippers, or wasn't there something? 
[00:58:30]  His barefoot.  He kissed Larry.  They kissed or something.  That's 94?  Yeah, dude, 94.  It's 94 already.  Remember that?  I know.  And when that happened?  Wow.  Dude, come on.  How many years ago?  Fuck, stop.  Now, Larry was a great interviewer.  Guys.  Was.  I'm trying to get Brando for the show.  Right, Steve?  Yes, and Christian, I mean.  Yeah, oops.  Mark at Jersey's got a golf joke.  Mark.  What's up, guys? 
[00:59:00]  Hey, Mark.  Oh, yeah.  So, this old guy goes to this brand new country club, and he's like, hey, I want to play a round  of golf.  I say, all right.  Well, I should let you play for free today if you take out the Caddy Master 3000.  He's like, what the hell is a Caddy Master 3000?  He's like, oh, it's a state-of-the-art robot.  It's going to tell you which club to hit, how far you are from the hole.  It's fantastic.  He's like, all right, I'll give it a shot.  So, he goes out there.  He's playing his game.  Has a game of his life. 
[00:59:30]  Hits like 500 pars.  Never played better.  Goes back the next week, and he's like, hey, I want to take out one of those Caddy Master 3000s  again.  That thing was fantastic.  He's like, oh, well, we had a little.  Thank you, God.  Yes.  I hope that was a tractor trailer.  Was that a robot he was talking about?  The Caddy Master 2000?  Yeah.  Here's how the joke would have went.  Oh, my God.  And I didn't do that one.  No, you didn't.  That's like perfect timing.  I hope he did not do that one. 
[01:00:00]  That was right at the punchline.  The guy says, I believe this is where the joke was going to go, hey, I want to use one  of those Caddy Master 2000s again, and the people at the government 3000 again, and they  go, ah, look, we had to stop using them because they were silver, and the reflection of the  sun was making it impossible for people to see.  It was bothering their eyes.  And so to stop the sun from reflecting off them, we painted them black, and then none  of them showed up for work.  It was something like that. 
[01:00:30]  It's a joke I haven't heard in 20 years.  Ah, yeah.  So I apologize for butchering it, but that was the push of it.  That's what we would have heard?  Something to that.  Something to that effect?  Yeah.  Ah, God.  Yeah, wonderful.  That is great.  If that was a bridge abutment or a semi that ended that guy's call, I'm happy.  Hey, uh, what?  Go, go.  I'm sorry.  There's a teacher accused of kiddie porn.  Oops.  And a black guy.  Really?  Not usually a black guy crime.  Not a white guy crime. 
[01:01:00]  That's a white guy.  Kiddie porn on the computer is a white man's devil.  That's not usually a black guy crime.  It's getting a little confusing lately, because we had a black guy shooting up, you know,  the brewery.  Yes.  That's a white guy crime.  Mass murder.  And this is a white guy crime by a black guy.  And a black guy who was fucking squirting his semen on people out of a water bottle or  something.  Did you hear about the semen squirter?  That's a black guy?  Dude, I Googled it.  I would have sworn that was a white guy.  Black guys, we may have stolen your music.  You're stealing our crimes.  Yeah, they're really.  Stop it.  We really started to steal our crimes. 
[01:01:30]  Sterial killing.  That's ours.  We did that story last week when you weren't here, and I guess there's an update.  There's, what, more women coming forward that had semen sprayed on them?  Yeah.  And it was a black guy?  Yeah.  There's so much better ways to get cum on people.  Yeah, I Googled images and I couldn't believe he was a black guy.  Yeah, I would have never said that was a black guy.  Kitty porn, semen squirting, and shooting up the job.  Congratulations, black people.  You made it.  That's the semen squirter?  That's the semen squirter?  Look at his mugshot with his smiley face.  Little thin mustache.  He looks like a cum squirter. 
[01:02:00]  He does.  What's squirting the semen all about there, Jimmy, as far as a crime goes?  I know I just set myself up.  I'm going to say, it's got a little something to do with anger.  I think that's a little anger.  A little angry with the people you're-  Have cum!  I think there's a little silliness in there, too.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Mixed with a little silliness.  He don't look silly.  He don't look very silly.  You think he's a prankster?  It's, it's, there's some silliness to it.  It's fucking weird. 
[01:02:30]  And how does he do it?  I don't know.  I'm going to guess-  Isn't he collected in a bottle, we learned, or something?  Had to be watered with it, too.  Yeah, the story that I remember hearing was that it was collected in a water bottle,  and he would squeeze the bottle onto women.  Oh, that's great.  I love this guy, unless it was my chick that had black guy cum squirted on her.  Oh, my God.  Imagine if she came home, said, you're not going to believe what happened to me on the subway today.  And she's wiping.  He must have great loads.  Be able to fill up a water bottle?  I know, enough to get it to squirt out. 
[01:03:00]  I guarantee you there was water in there or something.  There's no way.  It was just his thick cum.  Yeah.  No.  It would just blurker, blurker out of a water bottle.  Dude, you'd have to dump it out like honey.  Right.  Hey, wait, stand here for a minute.  Hold on.  Hey, Tuma.  It's going to drip any second now.  Yeah, he's fucking, uh, he's fucking, uh, Keith David or David Keith is breaking his fucking jars of cum.  I'm going to hurt you, Red.  Tuma.  Yeah, his, his cum is, is, is, is cut.  It's cut with some shit. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Some water and shit.  It's not pure.  Maybe a little lotion or something, too.  Wow.  Uh, let me say hi to Chris in Westchester.  He's going to tell us a golf joke, Jimmy.  Oh.  Chris?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Real quick, uh, what do you get when you masturbate in your golf bag?  Um, hold on, let me guess.  What do you get when you masturbate in your golf bag?  A bunch of sticky nine-irons.  Icky Woods.  Jesus, chips was better. 
[01:04:00]  Icky Woods.  Are you, you're, uh, hold on, your thing cut out.  What do you, what'd you say?  Yeah, we didn't hear it.  We heard you!  Funny every time.  Why doesn't everyone know?  Hey, real quick, guys, I heard you guys on the preview.  That's taking too long.  What?  I got you guys on the free preview back in March, and I signed up for you guys, but  I think you guys are great.  That's fantastic.  That's my new thing.  That's all the balls.  Free preview works wonders. 
[01:04:30]  We did our job.  You guys are the best.  Have a good day.  Got a lot of new people to listen to this channel.  I'm an old boss, guys.  I like that.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, our fans.  All right, all right, all right.  Our listeners.  What's up with the JetBlue guy?  What's the latest on this fucking guy?  I know the latest in here.  Jimmy, not a fan.  I've had enough of fucking her.  Because everyone is saying, look, my first take on it was, everyone's had that shitty 
[01:05:00]  flight attendant who you hate, but then the passengers are horrible, too.  But the more it comes out, no passengers are back in his story.  They're saying it appeared he was drinking, because he was just opening and slamming things  shut.  He was being really rude to passengers.  On the flight.  Being a real cocksucker.  A jerk off.  It would be easy for one passenger to come forward and support the guy, too, because  then that passenger would have...  Absolutely.  You know what I mean?  He must have been a real fucking asshole.  Just a jerk off.  And they said he was just being very rude, short, and nasty to people. 
[01:05:30]  One woman said it appeared that he was drinking, or at least she thought he was.  My opinion of this guy, and it's honestly a guess, is that he was sober, because it says  on his Facebook, relapsed, and is just fucking perhaps going out of his mind over it.  And this is why he got sober, is because he's an asshole when he drinks.  I don't know.  If they said it appeared he was drinking, it wouldn't surprise me if he's just a very  recently relapsed, recovering person.  That's a very rough guess.  Complete guess.  Yeah, I don't like him. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I think it was premeditated, too.  Yeah.  It wasn't all sudden, out of nowhere.  I think he knew going to work.  He knew he was going to do that that day?  Either that day or in the very near future, he was done.  He's not a hero, though, because he fucking took the emergency slide.  Well, I'm glad you said that, because he wants to be in the air again.  He wants to work for an airline.  There's no fucking way anyone's going to hire him.  No.  He's a risk.  Way.  I think you said it, Jimmy.  If he didn't pull the fucking emergency chute and just kind of dramatically left the plane, 
[01:06:30]  maybe.  Maybe a curse.  Maybe.  Maybe one curse, but you can't have a liability like this guy in the air.  Look at his face.  He looks like a shit.  Yeah, he should have squirt-piled everybody.  How do we know he's not going to try something while the fucking plane is in the air?  He looks like an asshole.  He looks like a fucking asshole.  He looks like every flight attendant you've wanted to fucking punch in the mouth.  I agree with you.  I was trying not to jump on the bandwagon, because everyone's trying to knock this guy  down now, but I'm there now. 
[01:07:00]  I'm absolutely there.  I think he's going to realize really quick how short-lived his support is.  All that Facebook support is probably going to turn into, hey, fag, and just horrible  things being said to him.  Because the passengers are not backing him up, and there's a bunch of them saying he was  rude.  Like, one, and he's late, and he said to one, like, he's having a bad day.  He's just, he's a shithead.  Yeah.  The guy's a shithead.  A jerk. 
[01:07:30]  Just really fast.  Jeff in Idaho.  Ope, that seaman square guy is small time.  And we talk about this all the time, but add this to the equation.  These guys run up to Japanese girls in broad daylight and come on them.  Yeah, we've seen that.  That's a thing that's happening in Japan, Matt?  I'm not really buying it.  They run up, they're jerking off, and they run up and just squirt all over them.  You think it's all set up for their perversions?  Half of that Japanese shit is fake, and the other half is twisted, but it's not, you can't 
[01:08:00]  do that.  We have the cockpit audio from the JetBlue incident.  I don't know if there's much here, but let's take a listen.  We just had a slide deployment on 274, so that's in the book.  Copy that, sir.  There are technicians on the way to a special situation.  Thank you.  Can you give me the location of the slide that deployed?  Yeah, it's the R1 slide. 
[01:08:30]  It was intentionally deployed.  The R1 slide.  I think you can figure it out.  Look for a giant yellow slide sticking out of a fucking plane, you dopes.  The one plane with the slide out.  That'd be us.  The one plane that looks like they're having a good time.  Fucking idiots.  Yeah, with the fucking, with the fucking, the guy traipsing away in fucking ballerina  shoes.  Right.  That'd be the one with a beer and a fucking giant black fake cock.  Yeah, the guy with the bag and the beer and the gash on his head and the fake cock. 
[01:09:00]  That'd be the plane.  And people are saying that gash isn't from anything that happened on the flight.  No one remembers him banging his head on any luggage.  They said that he had it like when he, when they, a lot of them saw it when he got on board.  So it might have been when he was helping in the beginning.  But I believe he both did.  Maybe from the night before because he was drinking a little too much and fell down.  Yep, where the head wars.  And he continued his drinking.  Or the head plastic cock ring.  Maybe a big bottom.  Ka-dunk, ka-dunk.  We're watching these, um, uh, sharking in Japan. 
[01:09:30]  These skirt lifting.  Where the guys walk up and just lift up dresses and skirts.  And Japanese women have big bushes, huh?  That's awful.  What's going on there?  Horrible.  Like every one of them they're showing and they got like.  I think, uh, I think bush hair is sacred or something over there.  Is it?  Yeah, I think so.  Is it really something the emperor said?  We must all have pussy hair?  I think they worship it like.  Oh, double?  Like they worshiped a cow in India.  You can't mess with them.  You can't mess with them.  I think they're fake.  These are all fake.  I think they're fake. 
[01:10:00]  So obviously fake.  None of them wearing underwear.  And they're all, yeah, no, yeah.  And they're all hot girls, no underwear.  They're sexy though, man.  They got some nice.  They got nice hineys when they bend all the way over.  Yeah, when they bend over.  They got to kiss their own toes to make their ass look good.  Like, look at this.  They're all these little skirts, no underwear.  Oh, yeah, really?  And they all got the big bushes.  That's great.  Look, she's all annoyed, but stays in frame.  Well, that big bush didn't look too bad all of a sudden, right? 
[01:10:30]  Oh, you know something?  The fuck?  The bush is making a bit of a comeback.  Maybe it's time.  Maybe it's time.  I got to say, not a full big 70s Earth Mama muff.  But hair is making a comeback.  I think people are getting a little bored with the full shave.  Can I tell you a woman that I, and I hate hairy pussy.  No.  But there's a woman I saw who has a really giant pussy, and underarm hair, and a hairy  pussy who I would love.  She looks so dirty.  Dude, I'll die in a fucking eat this chick's pussy and underarms. 
[01:11:00]  Who is it?  But I don't like her hairy legs.  Wait, you eat underarms?  Yeah.  Oh, without a doubt, dude.  I don't like deodorant on them.  If the chemistry's right, underarm smell can be either really fucking foul.  How do you eat out an underarm?  Just tell her to lift her arm and put her to smell it and lick it, man.  It's fucking hot.  No deodorant, though.  Maybe not just a sniff and a quick lick.  You're right in there?  It depends if the girl likes it.  Some women are too ticklish.  But if a girl likes it, most women like it because no one's it.  You just can't.  You don't flick your tongue. 
[01:11:30]  You just kind of put your mouth on it and very slow, long licks because it's not as ticklish  that way.  I wouldn't do that.  I don't mind at all, but I wouldn't, like, start licking.  That seems a little...  Dude.  Whatever.  I don't mind, like, a little, you know, kissing of the shoulder after sex and they're  a little sweaty and stuff like that.  No, I mean fucking full-on foul.  But this woman...  Full-on foul.  I actually thought of you guys when I was downloading her stuff because I'm like, these  guys would fucking hate this chick. 
[01:12:00]  Where is she?  What's her name?  Please.  Can you write it down?  Yeah, write it down.  It's not a good name.  Oh, it's not a good name.  I don't like her hairy legs.  I don't like that.  She doesn't shave at all.  I get that.  That's a thing.  Don't like the hairy legs and the pussy has to be shaved.  Yeah.  I wish the pussy was shaved.  But there's something about it.  It seems that you're kind of digging.  Yeah, her big pussy.  I like her big pussy.  So you'd rather not have hair so you could really see it.  It's the worst name ever.  That's not her real name.  Can I see the name? 
[01:12:30]  That is horrible.  Is this really her name on the internet?  I believe it is, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  That's a dumb name.  That's a terrible name.  Her pussy just looks like it stinks, like the right amount.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like hippie pussy.  Hippie pussy.  Let's take a look.  Oh, verboten.  I hate when the verboten comes up.  That's a great name.  The other arm hair is rough, man.  Yeah, I agree.  I've tried, but it's rough, Jimmy. 
[01:13:00]  By the way, I really did try once, and it's just rough.  Wow.  A lot of forbiddens.  Remind me to tell you the dream that I had that made me think of young Ope.  No, it wasn't one of those.  All right.  Come on.  We won one picture of this bitch.  She looks like a man, Jimmy.  No, it's not her.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  She has dreadlocks.  Yeah.  Well, where did you see her?  Maybe you have to go to a specific website, because we can't find her.  Oh, okay.  Is that her?  Let me see.  Yeah.  Ethnic looking, though. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, but she has a big pussy.  Oh, God.  There's a fucking nose hanging out of her pussy.  I know.  What a great big pussy.  But I don't like the leg hair, and I wish her pussy and ass were shaved.  She has awful boobs, man.  I would eat her pussy, though, because it probably stinks.  No, they're okay.  No, they're a little flapjack-ish.  Yeah, they're flapjack-y.  You're right.  We hate her.  That's okay.  I knew you would.  But I would love to.  Her name is...  Look at the underarms.  I want to smell her underarms.  She almost looks like a guy in this picture right here that Danny just popped up.  Oh, what about it?  Foreboding, but... 
[01:14:00]  I hate that.  Oh, okay.  There's some...  Not that part.  I'm in the face.  Oh, look at the hairy armpits.  And I never have an...  I don't like a hairy armpit on a girl.  I really don't.  Yeah.  But it just looks like it smells really nasty.  How do you know about this girl, and why would you look her up?  I was flipping around.  I'll tell you how.  I was flipping around clips for sale, because I actually buy porn on clips for sale, and  I think I was looking up big clits, or big pussy, or big pussy lips.  It was one of those big pussy lips things.  I love how you can find anything now.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  But you dig this one, huh?  But look at her pussy. 
[01:14:30]  Let's see that.  If the fucking pussy and the legs were shaved, I'd marry her.  Look at that fucking meaty pussy.  She rules.  Meaty pussy.  I love how you try to sell it.  Dude, I love it.  It looks like a sirloin I had last night.  Oh, I know.  It's wonderful.  So you get it.  Just drag us into your sick world.  Fuck you, man.  Hi, Jimmy.  I'm trying to have an open mind for you, Jimmy, but I don't know.  That's a little rough.  You think she's stinky?  Yeah, I bet she's like one of those people that doesn't wear deodorant. 
[01:15:00]  Pits price smell.  But if that's a bad chemistry, it's disgusting.  But if the chemistry is right, man.  Yeah, what's that about?  You're so right.  Some girls, you don't give a shit what they smell like.  Some girls, it doesn't matter.  And others, you're just like, get the fuck away from me.  I wonder if that's nature.  I'll lay around for days.  Of course it's nature.  No shower.  Just fucking laying in your own funk and cum.  It's great.  If my girlfriend stinks, I don't mind.  Let's go to Brian in Indiana.  Hello? 
[01:15:30]  Hi, Brian.  Hello.  Brian.  Hey, yeah.  I got a golf joke.  Do you?  Jesus.  Yeah.  This big old sailor boy gets a few days shore leave.  He's in the Orient.  He finds him an Asian hooker, and he gets to going at it.  He gets busy, and she's yelling, Shanghai, Shanghai.  Wrong hole.  Yeah.  Well, sir, I never heard the joke.  I just love flirting out the punchline.  Is he still here? 
[01:16:00]  Let's try another one.  Kenny in Georgia.  Kenny.  Hey, Kenny.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How y'all doing?  Sorry.  I got a golf joke.  Two doctors were playing golf, and one of them had this ball.  It was just all beat up, banged up, terrible-looking golf ball.  And his buddy said, well, look, if you can't afford a new golf ball, I got some new golf balls out here.  You can use one of mine.  He goes, no.  He said, this is my favorite golf ball.  He said, you cannot lose this golf ball.  I hate how he says ball.  Golf ball.  And golf.  Golf ball.  Golf ball.  Golf ball. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  So he said, well, what do you mean you can't lose it?  He said, well, if I hit it over there in the lake, it floats.  If I hit it, it goes out in the rough.  Sounds like Percy.  Doesn't he sound like Percy from the Green Mile?  I don't know who Percy is.  Yeah.  Percy.  Go ahead, Kenny.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  And he said, if I hit it in the rough, it beats, and, you know, there it is.  And he said, well, wow.  He said, where'd you get that golf ball?  He said, I found it. 
[01:17:00]  Um.  His phone must have cut out because that couldn't be the end of the joke.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  What does that mean?  Yeah, what does it mean?  What does what mean?  The golf joke.  I don't get it.  Yeah, we didn't get the punchline.  Oh, that's because you're not from Georgia.  Why?  What happened?  What happens in Georgia?  Exactly.  That we don't know.  It's got a lynching point to it? 
[01:17:30]  What does that mean?  Will you explain the joke, sir?  No, I know how you guys work.  Honestly, I really don't get it.  I need to know why we're supposed to laugh at that punchline, and we didn't.  Because you couldn't lose the golf ball.  Oh, and then somebody else lost it, and he found it.  Absolutely.  Okay.  It might have hurt if we didn't stop him.  Maybe it wasn't.  Maybe.  He's like, you can't lose this golf ball.  It's unlosable.  Where'd you get it?  I found it.  Somebody lost it.  Somebody lost it.  Oh, it's a very cerebral joke. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, I wouldn't call that joke a scream, but.  Yeah.  A hoot.  Okay, guys.  Have a good one.  Gob bomb.  Gob bomb.  Right.  It's horrible.  It's great the way he's done that.  So Slater.  Was that it?  Stephen Slater.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you explain why you don't like him?  I don't remember.  I did, yeah.  Yeah, because he's just a fucking nasty ass.  He reminds me of every flight attendant.  Because flight attendants have gotten, and again, I know you deal with the public, and 
[01:18:30]  the public is despicable.  But I've dealt with so many.  I've watched rudeness happen to a point where it's like, even that customer's not wrong  to be asking.  I've watched a woman ask a guy one time, a lead flight attendant on a flight, Continental,  asked very nicely about her bags, which had been misplaced.  And he was going, well, I guess you're, he was just being a total cunt to her.  Yeah.  And I almost, you know, I said something to him, but I'm like, that's none of my fucking  business.  They think their job is more important than it is.  Yeah.  And this came from.  That happens all over the place. 
[01:19:00]  This came from bringing guys on board as fucking flight attendants and, and all these, um, the  women not wanting to be like this sex symbol thing.  Because years ago, we talked about it before.  That was the whole thing with a stewardess before they were called flight attendants.  And they were stewardess, uh, stewardesses.  They were supposed to be in little skirts, the hot girls walking around the airplane, giving  you your shit.  And then it turned into this fucking, just any old bat could be on the fucking, on a 
[01:19:30]  plane serving you shit.  What happened to, you know, hi, I'm Samantha.  Fly me.  No shit, man.  All that shit went away when they didn't want to be fucking looked at.  They hired, they hired sexy girls to be, you know, flight attendants.  Or sexy stews.  Of course.  When it became about safety, that's when it started to change.  Because I would rather have, I would literally rather have large black flight attendants.  Really?  Fuck it.  Or other, just men in general. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Really?  Much rather.  That could take care of a problem.  Fuck yeah, dude.  I don't want some fucking hot.  You're an airplane cuckold.  But you know what I mean?  Like, when I see, when I see buff flight attendants and fucking guys that you know can throw down,  I'm like, that's who I want.  Kick some ass.  Yeah, if some fucking, some jihadist scumbag is running up the aisle,  I want a guy who can fucking throw a left hook.  Yeah.  And fucking shatter his jaw.  I guess you're right in this day and age.  You'll never get that. 
[01:20:30]  Why?  You're not going to get the big guy that could take care of situations.  I've seen him on a couple planes.  Yeah, I've seen a few.  Yeah, but you know, it was so nice to just see a fucking hotness.  Just hotness walking up and down.  And she would like bend over you because she had to like fix something.  Man, excuse me, not even bending over you.  How about serving the guy in the aisle across from you so you could catch that ass in the little skirt?  Absolutely.  That shit's the shit.  Hey, Jimmy, what was the name of that girl?  Because now people want to look her up.  It's a terrible name, but I love her. 
[01:21:00]  Big Clitty Bush.  Big Clitty Bush.  I don't think that's her real name.  You'll get results for Kitty also.  Kitty?  Oh, Kitty Bush, right?  Maybe it's Big Kitty Bush.  I'm sorry.  Big Kitty Bush.  Yeah, Kitty Bush.  She's got dreadlocks, and I like her tits, and she has a big, fat pussy.  I just don't like the hairy legs.  I wish she'd shave her pussy and ass.  Not into the...  Is that Sarah Silverman in One Piece?  Let me see.  What happened?  Oh, what's that about? 
[01:21:30]  That looks like Sarah.  Funny.  Are there any...  Maybe that's a weird pose.  Where's another one?  Let's see.  That's not a flattering shot of her.  Let's see another shot.  No, it's not a good shot of her.  That's a little rough.  That was a little...  Oh, boy.  That's not much better.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  What?  Her rump looks good, though.  Sarah's rump looks nice.  It's spankable.  I don't know about that, Jimmy.  It's kind of plump.  Maybe it's another picture.  Maybe we missed out.  Let's try one.  And there's another picture that...  Yeah, give us the best one in the set. 
[01:22:00]  All right.  Here's one more in the set.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  That's not good.  Wow.  I would fucking eat that ass in a second.  I really would.  Would you?  Yeah.  Fuck, yeah.  It's all plump, hanging out of the bathing suit.  I think her bathing suit's too big.  It's a dumpy-looking old lady one-piece she's wearing.  It's horrible.  Hey, going back.  Rihanna has a tattoo that's misspelled.  Oh, is that great?  It's not misspelled.  It's just...  Leave out a G? 
[01:22:30]  Oh, talk to Laura.  It just never ends.  No, it doesn't.  It's a loop.  It really is.  Steve, racism, gay jokes, repeat.  What's the problem with the tattoo?  Why is...  Apparently it's grammatically incorrect. 
[01:23:00]  Because it's French.  It says Rebelle Fleur.  And that's supposed to be Rebel Flower.  But I guess in France, the thing comes first.  I always hate that.  When dumb fucking languages mix shit up.  I would love to beat her up, but who gives a shit?  Like, oh, that's a...  Like, in English, you're going like, oh, wow, that's a big house.  And in some dumb language, it's like, the house big.  It's like, it doesn't mean anything. 
[01:23:30]  Casa Grande.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, house big.  Add some detail to the fucking...  To your language.  I'm mad at language.  Ah.  Casa Grande.  House big.  Who talks like that?  Oh, Mars.  Yeah, exactly.  Look at our own incompetent engineer.  Is he sleeping?  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  Engineer in a competente.  It's not good for morale, man.  Engineer in a competente.  That's what this play...  This play...  It don't matter.  You can just fucking sleep.  Oh, yeah.  Mars is really good.  I don't mind if Mars is running.  You all right?  I'm good.  Why are you sleeping?  I'm not.  I'm just listening.  And the sad part is, he's got the headphones on, so he's listening to the show.  Oh, he listens.  That's great.  He listens every day.  He plays merengue on.  I guess the show's putting you to sleep, huh?  Putting me to sleep.  We could all sit and take naps. 
[01:24:30]  We should do this in shifts.  Not a bad idea.  That'd be great.  One of us just sleeps an hour later.  We'll be doing it from your basement soon.  Jesus.  Fantastic.  Just snooze.  Take shifts.  How long before they notice?  If, like, one of us...  So far, five years.  You get an hour, Hope can nap.  Then another hour, Jimmy naps. 
[01:25:00]  It'd be great.  Another hour, I can pass out.  Pass out.  That isn't really a misspelling right there, though.  That's a little picky.  It was a little picky.  With that, why don't we take a break?  Hey, we got Danielle Staub coming in today.  Yes, we do.  I don't know if this is a good booking for the Opie and Anthony show, because I don't  know if a lot of our audience is watching the New Jersey Housewives.  Yeah.  Or Real Housewives of New Jersey.  But it's a pretty fucking good show, and she's a real bitch on it. 
[01:25:30]  Is she awful?  And now I think she's a lesbian, and she's dancing, and...  Fuck, Jersey becomes so popular.  She's got young daughters, and the one daughter is going to be, like, a big-time model.  Yeah, is she hot, let's say?  She really is hot.  Where's the daughter?  And how old is she?  High school?  Oh, okay.  Maybe 17 at this point.  I don't know.  Wow.  But she's caused a lot of controversy on this Real Housewives of New Jersey, so she's coming  in.  I guess she's got some dumb song.  Oh, shit. 
[01:26:00]  That she's promoting, and...  Go to one of the other pictures.  Go to the bottom...  Down one.  Now, over to the right.  That?  Is that her?  Yeah.  These are all, uh...  Let me see.  Yeah, she's...  Oh, fucking A.  Yeah, her daughter is, uh, gonna be a big-time model.  She's got that look.  That's retarded.  So, where's the fucking, uh...  And all the other housewives on this show hate Daniel Staub, and...  Yeah.  So, we'll get her in here today. 
[01:26:30]  Well, at least I know what to talk to her about now.  She's got a sex tape, and I think she, uh...  I like that.  ...was involved with some shit back in the day, back in the day.  Where are you?  Drug deal gone bad in the 80s.  Hmm.  She's 15?  Really?  Oh, she's only 15?  I don't know.  The story's getting better and better.  Well, fuck, man.  When they take the pictures...  Show a full body shot.  When they take the pictures, you don't know that.  They make them look like they're fucking a lot older.  Is that her right there?  16? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, look at that.  She's got that model body.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Long legs.  Let's just...  Thin.  Let's just have her daughter's pictures up and just moan when she walks in.  We'll just be spanking fucking loads all over the screen.  It's a water bottle, so we can use it later.  Stand up and just...  Is that runway?  She's doing a little runway?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That snotty model look.  It's fucking great.  I was...  A quick dream.  I thought of you, Ope.  I dreamt...  I woke...  I dreamt that I was around President Obama. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, no.  I did, and that we were going to be friends.  Nice!  And we were going to do...  He was going to do the radio show.  Yeah.  And so I was sitting there.  I was about to go talk to him, and he was standing facing away from me with two people.  And the one on his right side moved.  So I'm approaching, and there's a beauty queen, like, looking at us, and I stand right next  to Obama.  And it's me and him and someone else.  And I'm about to talk to him, and my fucking alarm went off.  And I didn't get to talk to Obama.  Oh, you had to wake up.  So I was like, I want to go back to this dream. 
[01:28:00]  So I fucking reset the alarm.  This was yesterday afternoon, and...  You could go back to a dream?  Normally, no.  But for some reason, I was sleeping so well, I knew I could.  And I go back to the dream, and all of a sudden, Obama's still there, and I have no shirt on,  because I guess that's the way I was sleeping.  And we're going to do the radio show.  So I walk up to him, and Secret Service stops me.  And I'm like, well, we're doing the radio show.  And they're like, oh, okay.  And I go stand next to him with no shirt, and I don't know what to say to him, and Michael 
[01:28:30]  Douglas is right there.  And I know Michael Douglas wants to talk to him, too.  So part of me knows...  This is out of control.  I...  I...  A part of me knows that it's...  I know I have control, although I don't know I'm dreaming.  It's not that much control.  Yeah.  But I have one moment with Obama, and I know that.  And Michael Douglas is thinking of something to say.  So I just make up a Russian name to ask him about, and I say to Obama, something about  school.  I'm like, hey, did you know Vladimir, or whatever, like a Russian name? 
[01:29:00]  And he goes, yes!  And he shakes my hand happily.  And then he walks away, and Michael Douglas is like, who's this guy?  That's the end of my dream.  Oh, my God.  That's the worst dream ever.  Do you know Vladimir something?  That is the worst dream ever.  I had a similar dream, though.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I walked up, Obama was there, and my alarm went off, but it was my house alarm  he was robbing me. 
[01:29:30]  Couldn't help yourself, could you?  You know what that dream thing is all about, though?  When you said it got to a good point in your dream, and then the alarm went off?  If it wasn't for the alarm clock, you wouldn't even remember that you did that dream.  You might be right.  That's exactly how that shit works.  So you shouldn't really be frustrated, because an alarm clock is, you know, waking you up from  a good dream.  You wouldn't remember that dream if you weren't woken up.  Thank you.  I asked him about Vladimir, and he knew him.  Vladimir, and he knew him.  But to go back to a dream, that's tough.  I do. 
[01:30:00]  I have very, very...  One out of a thousand times I can do that.  But when you do go back to a dream, the circumstances are drastically different.  Yeah, it will change on you.  It's like, fuck, I want to go back to the other version of this dream.  I know.  Let me say hi to Jason in Ohio.  Jason?  Morning, boys.  Hey, buddy.  You guys still pissed off at LeBron James up there?  That's a setting gone.  Let's not deal with that anymore.  Yeah.  Fucking Miami Heat going back to Cleveland December 2nd is the big day, where Cleveland  could get their revenge. 
[01:30:30]  But they'll just sit there in that arena and be pussies in the end.  You'll see.  They'll applaud him.  Go ahead, Jason.  So, anyways, every time I get home from work, the wife's got that housewife show on or whatever,  and that Danielle brought is a massive C.  All those chicks are bitches to begin with, but she goes to the party.  She's so afraid of the other girls.  She's got Hell's Angels guys backing her up, and that song she's got is going to remind you  of Mel Gibson's girlfriend's song.  It's all bullshit. 
[01:31:00]  They're all...  Do we have the song?  I want to hear it.  She's coming in to promote it.  Gotta hear that piece of great music.  Her new song is called Real Close.  Maybe she's good.  Let's give her a chance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why not?  I'll give it a listen.  You think we're going to get along with her?  Big C.  No, I know she's a big C. I've taken a peek at that show.  No one likes her.  Does she have a nice ass?  She's not likeable.  Let's go to Josh in Baltimore.  Josh.  Hey, Josh.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Josh.  Long-time listener, first-time caller.  Wank, wank.  Yeah. 
[01:31:30]  I...  If you check out Danielle's younger daughter, she's like only 11, but she's going to be gorgeous.  She's much more than you.  A lot.  But better looking than the older daughter.  Yeah, but the young one is trying to get a music career going.  She is.  It's a beautiful song.  See, I know this show way too much.  All right.  And I would love to hate fuck Danielle, and I would tell her to her face.  Hate fuck her.  I would hate fuck her.  Now, for an older woman, we got some naked pictures of her up there.  What do you think?  For an older woman.  Let's put it in the older woman's side. 
[01:32:00]  What's going on with the tits?  I think she's sexy, man.  She's a sexy woman.  I think she had her boobs redone because they were the worst...  I think they said the doctor that had to redo her boobs said this is the worst fucking  boob job I've ever seen.  Oh, really?  So they needed to repair that shit?  So we could talk to her about her shitty tits, too.  Let me write that.  Ask about shitty tits.  I think she's kind of attractive, man.  Ask about shitty tits.  I don't think any woman wants to have shitty tits. 
[01:32:30]  No, girl.  You've never seen that in a profile, like on J-Date or something?  Right.  I like long walks in the park and a woman with shitty tits.  Right.  Shitty tits.  What makes shitty tits?  I've seen some shitty tits.  Yeah, I have, too.  That's so funny.  I've seen a lot of shitty tits.  Shitty tits.  You've got some shitty tits.  Usually they're on the small side and already kind of like flat.  Horrendous.  Like saggy.  Those are shitty tits. 
[01:33:00]  I just want to say that over and over again now.  Jimmy, you know, I'm going to help you along here.  I usually don't do this, but...  Yay, I love help.  We've got another big pussy lover that wants to talk to you.  John in North Carolina.  You're on with Jim Norton.  What's up, guys?  Love the show.  Hey, buddy.  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  You rock.  Well, thank you, sir.  Yes, sir.  Anyway, I love a big, fat, meaty-ass pussy, and I love to make out with armpits, too, man.  You are the best.  Dude, is there any porn stars whose pussies you love? 
[01:33:30]  Well, I used to cut hair for a living, and no, I'm not gay, but I used to cut this girl's hair that was a porn star, and she was Asian.  I don't remember her name, like the name she gave me.  I think she was Asian.  Can I ask you, sir, and I do believe you, you cut hair, and you're not gay.  I don't get that.  Why would you go into that profession if you weren't gay?  Why wouldn't you?  Think about it. 
[01:34:00]  I mean, you're around women all day long.  So then why did you guys get the bad rap on the whole thing?  I guess you just made a very good point.  You're around, you know, hopefully a lot of beautiful women every day.  So why, when you tell people you're a hairdresser, they instantly think you're gay and make fun of you?  Well, I guess, you know, for the most part, most men that are in the business are gay.  But, first of all, I swear I'm not, because I, just like Jimmy, I loved it. 
[01:34:30]  I wasn't even doubting that part of it.  I just wanted you to answer the question.  Well, I mean, you know, it's just one of those deals where, I mean, I loved it, man.  I absolutely love it.  I remember I'm around women all day long, and these girls are wild, man.  I'm telling you, they get to know you on a personal level, and, dude,  I mean, it's the best.  James in Maryland.  James.  Hey, guys.  Yeah, what's up, brother?  Daniel Stobb has a restraining order against some 18-year-old chick. 
[01:35:00]  She pulled her hair extensions out.  Yeah, I'm trying to talk about this broad a little bit, so these guys are up to speed.  Yeah, well, one of the episodes, one of the other housewives' daughters tried to rip out her hair extensions.  Just gave her a quick pull.  And Daniel Stobb's making a big deal about it and suing the teenage daughter of this other housewife.  Yes.  Double C is not even the term, Opie.  It's maybe a cunt, cunt bitch. 
[01:35:30]  I mean.  Wow.  I'm going to ask her if she doesn't.  Put it this way.  If she died in a car accident, you wouldn't worry about it.  I'm going to ask her if she minds being called a cunt, cunt bitch, and I want to ask her about her shitty tits.  Shitty tits and fuckable daughter.  Wow.  Yeah.  You take that one on.  You take that one on.  Do you think she'll care?  I don't know.  Yeah, daughter's underage.  Fucking.  I think the daughter doesn't like her.  Oh, really?  They kind of hinted at that during the fucking show. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Right, James?  That's right.  Hey, Anthony, did you hear about that guy saying that Sarah Palin should die in a plane accident?  It's funny.  That fucking Democrat did say that, and that's not getting the play that fucking Dr. Laura will get.  You're right.  No.  Well, if you go to the Toronto Sun web page, I guess you go to Canada for that news.  It's front page.  Okay.  Yeah, you won't get that much here.  Yeah.  All right.  Godspeed, guys.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Love you, Jimmy.  Any luck when you put shitty tits in the Google image there, Danny? 
[01:36:30]  Shitty tits.  Danny, I saw that you were trying.  Oh, God.  Well, that's shitty tits.  There's a girl with shit smeared on her tits.  They got to work on their concoction, though.  That looks very literal.  It looks like dog food.  Jimmy?  Those are awful.  Look at a kiss performing with Linda Carter.  Those are awful.  Yeah, those are horrible.  Shitty tits.  Okay.  Shitty tits.  Oh, here we go.  Damien in Jersey. 
[01:37:00]  Damien?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm forced to watch this fucking garbage show every week with my girlfriend.  The housewives of New Jersey are real housewives?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And this bitch is just such a fucking con with a capital C.  Every time, she just reaffirms to herself, like, karma's going to get you back.  And she's just constantly the one causing all the trouble.  She's like that crazy friend that everybody has that doesn't know is fucking crazy. 
[01:37:30]  Crazy.  All right.  Well, how do we go into this interview?  No.  With an open mind?  Yeah, man.  She might be fucking great.  It's like, I think you guys are going to have a problem because, like, she's literally  delusional.  So, like, if you bring up these situations, she thinks she's always right.  Like, I have no interest in her, like, as far as, I know nothing about her, so I don't,  whatever her explanation is, is fine with me.  I don't give a fuck.  Then let's kick her to the curb and not interview her.  Fuck it.  I'd say give her a chance at least and let her embarrass herself and then get her out 
[01:38:00]  of there.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Dude, she's stripping.  How great is this?  She's, she's great.  She used to do fucking, uh, these allegations that she used to hook.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know if that's true.  I might just be a mad and nasty expert.  Well, let's ask her about it.  You're going to ask her about that?  Without a doubt.  Sure.  So, do you mind being called a cunt, cunt bitch?  Ask her about her shitty tits and what's that?  I'm going to ask her if she used to hook.  Again, that could just be a rotten...  And what's your question, Ant?  Uh, fuckable daughter.  Jesus. 
[01:38:30]  Holy shit.  All right, Damien, thank you.  All right, thanks, guys.  What does Larissa want from Pittsburgh?  Uh, Larissa.  Yes.  What do you want?  We're calling to talk about Danielle Straub.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  See, this, this, this gets people talking in.  It certainly does.  Maybe this is a good booking for the show after all.  Yes.  By the way, still not being... 
[01:39:00]  Is she bad?  She's horrible.  She plays the victim.  Every episode, they put her on, they do a little one-on-one interview, and she's constantly  talking about how she's the victim.  Everybody hates her.  Everybody's trying to...  She now has the thing that they're all trying...  All these other housewives are out to give her, like, bodily harm.  Like, they're trying to kill her.  Yeah.  Absolutely biggest cunt in the world. 
[01:39:30]  Wow, people really don't like her.  All right, hopefully...  Nobody likes her.  Hopefully you guys will call when she's in here.  Yeah.  Oh, I would love to.  It's an amazing booking for the show.  Have a good one.  Yeah, all right.  Expendables come out today?  Yeah.  That's today, huh?  Why didn't we get any other Expendable guys?  Yeah, come on.  We had Steve Austin in here when he was promoting a shitty movie, and he even admitted it wasn't  a great movie, and he said at the time...  Steve Austin.  Stone Cold.  Oh, Stone Cold, okay.  And at the time, he even said, yeah, I don't really give a crap much about this movie, 
[01:40:00]  but I gotta tell you, I'm in a movie with Sylvester Stallone, I broke his neck, and I can't  wait to come in and promote that movie on your show.  And we didn't get him.  So I'm kind of a...  What is the deal with Arnold in that?  It's gotta be a two-second thing, because he's not even in the credits, like the big  promo poster they got out.  Yeah, that's probably part of his deal.  You can't...  Yeah, he'll do a walk-on or something, but you can't...  They show him in the trailer talking to Sly. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, you're right.  He probably has a very small scene.  But it must be really fucking short.  It's probably the whole thing.  I've read, well, I'm sure Steve knows a lot more.  Yes.  You don't know shit.  But I think it was supposed to be secret, and then once it got out, they kind of started  promoting the fact.  Ah, okay.  But Steve's saying that I'm wrong, so I'm just gonna turn my mic off.  Happy to be here.  Yes, Steve, yes.  And he, when, like the day or the week after he shot it, he announced that he was gonna  be in it, so...  And it was like a five-minute cameo, where he woke up at 5.30 in the morning with Bruce 
[01:41:00]  Willis.  In the morning.  And Schwarzenegger plays, I guess, an arch-nemesis, old mercenary rival of Stallone's, who's offered  the same job, turns it down, and walks out.  And it's like the very beginning of the movie.  It's just probably him to have his foot back in the door, because once he's no longer governor,  he'll just go back to acting.  Why didn't we get any of the guys?  The only other guy we were supposed to get was Austin and his travel schedule changed.  What about Sly?  But let me break this down. 
[01:41:30]  His travel schedule doesn't change when he's desperate and has to fucking promote a shitty  movie.  Exactly.  It's unbelievable.  What about a phone-in with Sly?  I'm gonna tell you something.  His own money is involved in this movie.  We had Sly on the phone-in with Sly before, too.  By the way, Big Mama Prod saw the movie already.  Tweeted about it overnight and said it's amazing.  Really?  I forgot exactly what his tweet said, but he loved it.  It wasn't a spoiler, was it?  No, he just loved it.  Because it's badass action?  Yeah, he likes action flicks. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, of course.  They all do.  You guys want to hear Daniel Stobb's song?  Yeah, I do.  What happened?  Nothing.  Keith, what's up?  Yeah, she definitely, they talk about her shitty tits, but they actually call her square  tits.  Because one of them was, one of the other housewives was changing with her in a dressing room one  episode and said that.  Oh, she's writing it down.  I forgot about that. 
[01:42:30]  I do remember that.  Yeah, the rest of the housewives call her square tits.  Hey, and you gotta ask her about her great New Jersey ex-con.  She's got a buddy who's an ex-con named Danny, and she takes Danny when she thinks it's  going to get real dirty.  And Danny says he'll do his 30 to life if need be.  Yeah, I think Danny will probably be with her today, so.  I'm great.  All right, Keith, thank you.  I gotta go to Footer.  Footer has a very good observation.  Footer?  Yo, what's up, boys? 
[01:43:00]  Hey.  Hey, why every fucking time when anybody calls up about, like, watching something that's  fucked up or just, like, for girls, it was like, oh, well, you know, I watched this  because my girlfriend was watching it.  What, nobody has fucking two TVs in the house?  Yeah.  Watch on a TV.  Two TVs?  Oh, he's joking.  That's crazy to have two TVs in this day and age.  You're right.  I watch this show because it's kind of, you know, stupid, silly TV.  Yeah.  I'm not sitting there going, well, I saw this because I was forced to watch.  Yeah.  You're right.  Watch it. 
[01:43:30]  And you could justify it by saying, well, I'll have to watch it for the show.  You know what I mean?  Like, you have to fucking...  Yeah, I didn't even have to do that.  I just, you know, there's something weird about the show that I like.  So, you're right, though.  Thanks for not humiliating me, Anthony, when I called.  Why, when you tripped over humiliating?  Wow, Jimmy, you had to pick that up, huh?  Who didn't pick it up?  Anybody with these two little weird things on our heads picked it up?  You know who didn't pick it up?  Earless people.  Later, boys. 
[01:44:00]  By the way, my fucking, my iPad will still not stay online.  Still.  Problem not fixed.  They're working on this.  Problem not fixed.  Ridiculous.  I love the, we're working on it answer to everything.  Yeah.  Hey, here's Daniel Staub.  Here's her song.  Let me hear this.  You said Daniel, stop.  Daniel.  Daniel.  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Maybe it's good.  Thanks.  Real close.  What the fuck was that? 
[01:44:30]  That didn't sound right.  That didn't sound right.  Holy shit.  What was that fucking?  Listen to that note again.  If I could tell you how I feel  And if I could show you my love's for real

Dick in the shitter  Yeah  Oh, yeah  Real close to you  Back to the fucking  Barry Manilow piano  That's the closest you could be  With a chick  That stinks  I like that  Right in her turd cutter  I like that  Where the poo comes out  Where her poo-poo comes out  She's talking about  Where the poo comes out  Duck me any hole  Her doody  Her brown spot

Ha, ha, ha  Yeah, a bad one  Definitely  Cutting out  Yeah  Not enough action in it, though  There was no hook  She was trying to do  The whisper sing thing  There was just this  Plotting fucking  Dreck  With that airy trying to be sexy 
[01:49:30]  Because you're fucking singing airy  I think she decided she's a lesbian  I forgot about that part  Oh, really?  Yeah, I think she's doing a lesbian thing now  To get some attention  She's doing everything  People just do one or two of things  Like to be famous  Right  She's just doing all of it  Right  Get the daughters out there  You fucking  Get naked  You put out a song  You're a cunt  Let me say hi to Lisa in Jersey  I guess she watches  Lisa  Real Housewives of New Jersey

And this is what you have to ask Danielle about  When she comes in  Okay  Danielle Staub is not even her real name  Oh, shit  When she was about maybe 20 or so  You have to ask her about this  She was arrested for kidnapping and drug charges  Alright, write that down  And they mentioned this  Did you have that?  Kidnapping, drug charge, not real name  Yeah  And this is the best part 
[01:50:30]  And her real name is Beverly something  They've mentioned it a lot  Meryl  Beverly and Meryl, I believe  Really?  Yes, yes  Now, this is what you have to say  Which is the most obvious thing  She's, like, ruining Jackson's daughter's life  Ashley  For pulling her hair  And saying, you know  She has to teach her a lesson  And it's, like, it's her job  To straighten her out  And get her on the right path  Meanwhile, all Danielle does is  You know, pity herself  That she was so young  When she did these things  And no one will ever give her another chance 
[01:51:00]  And it ruined her whole life  But she's doing the same thing to Ashley  So that's what you gotta  That's what you have to confront her about  Well, cell guy here  Seems to have everything  That you should have written down  Shitty tits  Daughters are fuckable  Do you like to be called  Cunt, cunt, bitch?  Did you use the hook?  Do you have square tits?  Or shitty tits?  Is your piano player angry?  Are you arrested for kidnapping  And drug charges?  Yeah  And is that not your real name?

I say New York  But I just moved to New Jersey  It's been six years already  I think I'm always going to say  I just moved here  Wouldn't call that the funny part  Hey, thank you  Actually, you were wrong about a real name  William in Texas has a real name  Yes, William  Yes, I do believe her real name is  Square Tits McGillicuddy  Yes  McGillicuddy  McGillicuddy  So listen 
[01:52:30]  McGillicuddy  All kidding aside  SpongeBob Tits  I think E-Rock just tweeted her square tits  Can we go to E-Rock's page?  Please, really fast  Because now I've got to see what they look like  Before they attempted to fix them  Square Tits  Right?  Let's see  He wanted me to retweet this shit  I don't feel like retweeting today  Let me see  Oh, what would Tyler Durden do?  Had the pictures first  Okay  So this might be legit 
[01:53:00]  The internet's really slow today, huh?  Slow every day  Oh, God  Her elbows  The side view looks like she's pressed up against something  Wow, that does look a little square  She looks like she's pressed up against an imaginary wall  Isn't that weird?  You guys are being too hard on her, man  Is there more pictures?  Older lady  That's it  I'd give her ass a good eat  And I'd lick her elbows  What's this?  Really?  Oh, you're gonna have to fucking take a message  It's my fucking car dealer

Absolutely  If she's like, let me park my bike  I'll be up in a few minutes  First thing I do  All right, can we take a leak?  Yeah, I gotta pee  All right, we'll do that  Oh, nice  Jimmy loves the hoe 
[01:54:30]  Supposedly they're gonna do it again, man  Supposedly they're gonna do a little tour  God, I was listening to one of the classic channels here on SiriusXM  I don't know what it's called  It's classic music  Yeah  I know there's classic rewind  I listen to that one a lot 
[01:55:00]  Because it's like newer classic songs, if that makes sense  Anyway  Supposedly they're going back on tour  Supposedly there's a rumor they're gonna do Quadrophenia  From beginning to end  And  Some rumblings that they might go back into the studio  And do another album  Oh no, new who  And I remember  New who  I remember  Nineteen  It's gotta be eighty-nine  When it was the farewell tour 
[01:55:30]  I think they did one before eighty-nine  Even eighty-nine?  Yeah  So they supposedly said goodbye  To everybody twenty-some-odd years ago  And they're still  Yeah  Still  Going strong, I guess  Are they going strong still?  I guess they are  Their Super Bowl thing wasn't bad, right?  They do  Pack it out  Do they say when their farewell tours have been?  Yeah, I need to know that from Wikipedia  That's great  I remember late 80s, I believe 
[01:56:00]  It was Buffalo  I went to one of their farewell tours  Nineteen eighty-nine  It was  It was  They nailed it  Good call  Wow, twenty-one years ago they were doing a farewell tour?  Yeah  And then they came back in ninety-six  They did something between eighty-nine and ninety-six  Did they?  They had to have  No?  I don't know  Maybe not  Really?  Took a little time off  Well, Pete Townsend, you know  Had another interest  For a while there 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, he was in a little bit of a jam-up, wasn't he?  Doing research for a book  How the fuck do you get away with by saying you were doing research?  God bless him  Doing research for a book  My God  Leave the guy alone  What's he doing?  Hey, speaking of the past  E-Rock started a Twitter account called OA Photos  Do you go there every once in a while?  Oh yeah, every so often  He posted some fucking pictures yesterday  I can't believe we were able to do this stuff  Because you know how we talk from time to time  Like, oh, we used to be able to do 
[01:57:00]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba  Right  And I got proof of some of the stuff we used to do  With the Zone A Photos Twitter account  He put up pictures of us trying to get a girl  To give birth live in the studio  Oh, right  He also posted pictures of a guy eating live mice on our show  Oh, yeah  Can you imagine going to the lawyers here at SiriusXM  That couldn't happen  And tell them, look, we want a guy to come in and eat live mice  That ain't going to happen  That ain't happening, right?  Ain't going to happen 
[01:57:30]  But you go to OA Photos  And it just shows you that we used to get away with pretty much murder  Mida  Shows you how slow the internet is  Yeah, I know  Great  Well, it's probably getting slammed right now  I want to see the naked pregnant brud  Yeah  Supposedly there are nude photos up there of this girl  Why wouldn't there be?  And that kid's got to be at least 10 now  10, 11 years old  Wow, that's fucked up  Gotta be  Because I think that was late 90s  Where she came in 
[01:58:00]  She was overdue  And we made her run up and down stairs  We made her jump rope  We made her have sex with her husband in another room  And this was just an average show that day for us  I think that kid is, yeah, like 10 or 11  Probably 10 or 11  That's fucked up  Because we really thought, you know, we could really make our mark if we had a live birth  You were right  That would have been a big one  I know, we were bummed that we couldn't get the job done  Scott Herman was just looking the other way 
[01:58:30]  As this naked girl's running up and down the stairs  Nine months pregnant  Is Cigars and Scotch correct here?  Was it 11-year-old Gary?  Yeah  He can legally drink now  Oh yeah, easily, yeah  Holy shit  Yeah, he's got to be like 21, 22  And how old is, remember Skidmarks?  Skidmarks has got to be  In his 20s, early 20s  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Jesus Christ  Yeah, yeah, these were little fuckers that did our show  My God  You got the naked brugs 
[01:59:00]  Yeah  It's just what, it's just way too slow?  Yeah, it's really just molasses  Well, check it out for yourself then  I wanted to see the pictures though  Oh wow, okay, November 8th, 1999  So that kid is going to be 11 in November  And it was inside that fucking little munchkin  11  And the photos just will not fucking load  Damn it  Nope  Nope  Yup  Nope 
[01:59:30]  There's one  There's a picture of her just kind of fucking closed  Alright, here's some thumbnails coming up  Alright, we got some thumbnails  Oh boy  There she is  Jimmy, what do you think, huh?  Look at that  She's got a pregnant guy  She looks like me  She's got pigtails on  Yeah  There is a lot going on  Look at that  Look at her big pregnant belly  Wow  Her fucking ass  I don't have a pregnant fetish  But she's sexy 
[02:00:00]  I mean, you know, come on  Ant, no?  She's sexy?  No  No  Maybe not pregnant  No, she's  She was alright, I guess  As far as pregnant goes  She was a good egg  Alright, she  No  I love when people start typing and they go, no, no, no  Like, nah, I better not  God, it was five to seven at night 
[02:00:30]  I'm looking at the clock, it's like, fucking what?  Yeah  Oh my God  So, go to OA Photos  E-Rock put some photos up from the old days, from time to time  Yeah  And the latest batch is good  He's got a picture of Jimmy Kimmel on our show  And then this guy eating fucking live mice  How did we get away with it?  No one cared  Huh?  That's what it was  It was the fact that no one cared  Yeah, it's just weird that now we're on satellite 
[02:01:00]  And we can't do half that stuff that we got away with  No way  Really strange to me  Uh, let's say, uh, nah, I don't need to say how to these people  But supposedly the first farewell tour by the Who was 1982, Anthony  Yeah  And they went around with the class  Jesus  1982, then they did a farewell tour in 88, 89  Wow, I wore glasses?  When did I wear glasses?  Wow, that was before your LASIK surgery  That's fucked up  I don't even remember wearing glasses anymore  Yeah, first farewell tour, 82 
[02:01:30]  These are pretty fucking funny to look at  God damn, there's a lot of them  Who are the, um...  You don't remember the Shwoogies?  African gentlemen  We brought the Shwoogies in to scare, uh, Spaz  Because he was a blatant racist  Oh, right  So we...  That's when we, uh, met Chuck Nice  Is that Chuck Nice to the right?  No  I'm telling you, man  My memory is solid  Are you saying they all look alike?  Chuck Nice came in, uh, as part of the bit  Where we want to scare the shit out of Spaz 
[02:02:00]  For being a horrible racist  Right  So these, these scary black guys came in  And Chuck Nice  Funny  And that's how we met Chuck  Wow  And then we introduced him to the radio chick  And, uh, his career took off  And now he's all over TV, man  He's good on TV, too  Did I see Airsick?  Yeah  Airsick productions right there?  Paul Bond  Oh, yes  Billy Staples  Yeah  Wow, just amazing  Yes, E-Rock  E to the R  To the fridge  Yeah 
[02:02:30]  Um, a couple other galleries that are going to go up  Why?  You had a, uh, a transsexual in studio  And you looked at his new vagina  Oh, sorry  Okay  Did we look at a transsexual's vagina?  For the first time in my career, I don't remember something  Uh, it's called the He, She, Vag  So, uh, cleverly titled  Wait, can I see the pictures now?  I don't remember this  We looked at  We looked at that?  A real surgically  Yeah, someone who had the full change  And, uh, you were looking at his vagina 
[02:03:00]  Dude, I swear to you, I don't remember that  Oh, at least I have an excuse  I was drunk  Yeah, I had one, too  I was miserable  I wouldn't have taken anything at that point  So we have that  I gotta see those pictures  I don't remember that one  They're gonna go up over the weekend  Um, or later today, we'll have them up  Okay  Uh, the Nutcracker Suite  Oh, yeah, that was one of my favorite bits of all time  Yeah, let's try to get that done with the lawyers  The first lesbian for a day  We found a guy that, uh, loved being kicked in the fucking balls

Wow  Should we play the five-minute version?  Oh, man  Come on  Why not?  It is Friday  Yeah, but if they've never heard it before, who gives a shit?  It's five minutes  Yeah, exactly  I say  What do you want to do?

[02:05:00]  He is on his knees  He is chained to the bottom of the chair  His, uh, stuff, as it would be, is a little too prominent in those bikini, uh, panties  Girl, girl panties  He, he put on his sister's, his little sister's, uh, panties today  Isn't that cute?

[02:06:00]  Did you see him flinch?  And he hasn't been kicked yet  That was just the, the whip  He's lining up  Oh  Oh  He just buckled over  He just doubled over in pain  He's breathing really heavy  I have never seen anything like this  He's lining up again  Oh  Oh  Oh, he's flinching  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh

I'm a little scared  I'm ready  All right, I guess we're ready for more of this  I would miss this for the world  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  That was the right one  That was the right one  I'm gonna need some water soon  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[02:07:30]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  This is not right  Spike knows she hit too hard  Mother of God  Oh my God  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh my God  Oh  Oh  Oh 
[02:08:00]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  It's a bad one  I can't take this anymore  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  That's a flash  Is that me or the camera  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  That's got to be it  Oh  Oh  Oh my God  That's got to be it 
[02:08:30]  Oh  Oh  years  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  This isn't right  I got a shot of that on the video  That will make you cringe  Woo  Alright, let's see if we can't get a good kick in from Grandma  Grandma is lining up  She just gave him three quick shots. 
[02:09:00]  She gave him three quickies.  Yeah.  Grandma gave him three.  All right, hold on, Grandma.  How are you holding up?  I'm not.  I'm a Grandma.  Grandma's pretty good.  You missed, Grandma.  He's down.  He's down.  You don't talk Grandma like that.  Come on.  Grandma's a good shot. 
[02:09:30]  She got the bullseye.  Let's hear it for Grandma.  Grandma, put him down.  God, did she line up and kick him.  Someone's got to put a stop to this.  This is just not right.  It's really not right.  We must say, because we have a lot of ladies that listen to us.  Yeah.  Ladies, not all guys enjoy this.  It's a proof of masculinity.  Masculinity.  Oh, sure it is.  Well, then call me a pussy.  I found my limit. 
[02:10:00]  And there you have it.  We're back live in the year 2010.  I think everyone can tell because all I'm hearing about is how our voices have changed over the years.  Yeah, they've changed a little bit, a little bit.  It's the processing.  But fuck, how do we get away with that, man?  I don't know.  Could you imagine going to the lawyers now and saying, yeah, we want to have some guy come in here and then just have women kick him in the balls?  Yeah, really strange.  Now, OA photos will have the pictures from the old days. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  And E-Rock just came in here and said that we looked at a guy who had his dick cut off and that area made into a vagina.  Yeah.  I swear to you, I have no recollection of this.  So I go, E-Rock, you got to send me the picture?  Yeah.  It was a black guy.  What?  Do you have any recollection of this?  None at all.  You want to see the picture?  Probably not.  Can you zoom in on this fucker?  Let me zoom in.  What does it take to zoom in on one of those things?  All right.  Two fingers and you just kind of open it up. 
[02:11:00]  Hey, man, the iPhone killer, the torch.  When is it out?  Is it out already?  Next Tuesday, maybe?  I get the iPhone killer next week.  Here, here.  Here's Cory Hill.  Here, here.  That used to be where a dick went.  Or was.  I hate post-op trannies.  I don't acknowledge the post-op trannies.  I don't even remember this.  I don't even remember.  Jimmy doesn't acknowledge.  What are they, quitters?  Exactly.  What are you doing? 
[02:11:30]  You had some extra fun.  All of a sudden, you're spoiling it.  So E-Rock will post this picture as well.  I have no fucking memory of this show.  No, I don't remember that.  I remember most of the shows, I guess.  God, that's horrible.  All right.  I can't tweet that.  I can't tweet that, right?  They'll fucking yank it.  Yeah, fuck that, dude.  You can't.  They'll yank it.  Yeah.  Posterous, I think you're allowed to tweet some nudies.  I think Belladonna's account got yanked.  Tweet photo, you can't.  Oh, really? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, I think so, for probably the same reason.  Yeah, you can't.  You gotta be careful.  All right.  What are we gonna do?  Make love?  What time is this square-titted bitch coming in here?  She'll be in the 45 minutes.  I don't know why we said yes to this one.  Oh, I think she's great, man.  Give it a try.  This is very dangerous.  This is not gonna go well.  She probably comes in.  She's a nice lady.  Yeah, watch her be really fun.  I doubt it, too. 
[02:12:30]  I doubt it.  She's got an image to uphold.  I think her problem is that she's so full of herself.  Yeah.  And that's what we're not gonna be able to get past.  I hear she rolls her eyes a lot and stuff.  Yeah.  So, we'll see.  Fuck.  Fuck her.  Let me say hi to Brian in Connecticut.  Brian.  Guys, how you doing?  Welcome aboard, Brian.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, I actually do remember hearing the he-she bit on the radio.  Yeah.  I remember there was a black it. 
[02:13:00]  And I remember one of you guys, I don't remember which one, said,  it looks so bad, the clip was actually at the bottom instead of the top.  Okay, that's kind of ringing a bell.  Did we finger it or anything?  No.  Okay.  Did we finger it or anything?  You don't think you'd remember it?  Yeah, you'd remember that.  Remember fingering a maid vagina?  It was such a, that was such a 13-year-old boy's way of asking.  Did we finger it or anything?  You never know with our old show, man. 
[02:13:30]  There was some shit that went down.  That was funny.  I think you did say something like it had some kind of a, like the whole raw thing thing  with a man's smell.  Yeah, the smell.  We couldn't get past the smell.  Disgusting.  Yeah, I mean, if you're gonna do it, not that I would do that, but just leave the cock.  Jesus Christ.  The torch is out already?  Why did my cell phone guy call me?  Because probably he has a fucking torch and it's no good.  He tried.  Fuck.  The torch is burning something.  Why?  Artie, Artie, Artie, are you serious?  Yeah, I'm dead serious. 
[02:14:00]  Picked it up yesterday from my wife.  When was it released and where were the long lines for this iPhone killer?  Yeah, yeah.  I showed up AT&T store out here in the Long Island, by the mall in Smith Haven.  Yeah.  And it was just me and another guy.  But it's an iPhone guy and he was pretty impressed with it.  AT&T BlackBerry Torch, 9800, up for grabs August 12th.  All right, so it came out yesterday.  Yeah.  My fucking cell phone guy better call me today.  It was pretty cool.  It's pretty cool.  Wait, are you a BlackBerry? 
[02:14:30]  I'm saying pretty cool.  Show me a picture.  Are you a BlackBerry guy?  Yes, I am.  So what's different between this and the past BlackBerrys?  What are the upgrades?  The slide phone.  It's got the slide phone.  It's got a cut screen.  I know that.  I know that.  What about the video quality?  What about the...  The video, the picture quality is phenomenal.  The camera, ridiculous.  Can I...  Ridiculous.  Do they have like an i-fucking-movie app type thing so I could, you know, edit my movies  on the fly now and throw them up there?  I didn't get that far into it.  Because iPhone has that. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  I didn't get into that as far as, you know, we were just playing with it last night.  Yeah.  And, but I'll tell you what, it's pretty cool.  Like I said, my son's an iPhone guy and he was pretty impressed.  Yeah, I mean, you know, having that slide thing, I don't know.  A slide phone.  You don't have to use it at all.  Yeah, I understand that.  I bet it's great though.  I mean, I bet, I bet it's a good phone.  Four gigs.  Hey, I need to put business.  I need to make phone calls, so.  It's four gigs of storage?  No, it's not.  You're lying.  No.  Yes, it is. 
[02:15:30]  Four gigs of internal storage.  Yeah.  All right, and you make it fun by saying you can put a hundred songs in your phone.  You don't need more than a hundred songs.  Yes, you do.  No, you don't.  Oh, God, that's awful.  You need to take pictures and make phone calls.  That's what you need to do.  Wait, dude, are you kidding four gigs?  No, I'm not kidding.  Look, man.  What do you do with that?  Nothing.  I have no idea.  I make phone calls, Jimmy.  No, I know.  It's important to make phone calls, but what if you want to get these phones?  Man, you do other stuff with these phones now. 
[02:16:00]  You don't just make calls anymore.  All I care about is I need really good video quality off my phone, so I don't have to carry  my HD flip everywhere I go.  I love you.  That's what I really need.  And I need a nice, like a quick editing program, so I could do a little iMovie editing and then  upload right to fucking YouTube without it taking three hours for a 20-second clip.  Dude, get an iPhone.  No.  Because you got the, for what you need?  No.  For what you need, it'll upload great.  And you can send it, hold on, so you're screaming, you can send it right to YouTube. 
[02:16:30]  I'm weakening, but I'm not giving in.  Nope.  I'd rather go old school.  But that's not old school.  Look.  I already have iMovie installed.  I didn't even know.  I'm looking going, oh, I'm going to install it.  You look at some apps and go, yeah, I would really like to have that one.  Oh, fuck, I have it.  That must mean I never use it.  I will, this could be my last BlackBerry, though, I'll be honest with you.  I will buy the torch.  Of course it's going to be.  Why would you have anything?  I'll give you guys a review in the next week or so, but this could be it for me. 
[02:17:00]  You'll like it.  You'll like it.  By the way, apps for the iPad are fucking expensive.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  I don't know why.  It's bigger, and they know that we're stupid.  We'll buy anything.  All right, Artie, thanks for the, uh.  All right, boys.  Artie, Artie, Artie.  I'm surprised there weren't long lines.  I didn't know it was released this long.  Oh, yeah, the lines were, uh, really.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Long.  You really do have to just make the jump. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Everybody that does goes like, oh, my God, this is great.  32 gigs.  Thank you, Tyler in Ohio.  Upgradable.  Upgradable, too.  Upgradable, too.  32 gigs.  Yeah.  Right, Tyler?  Yes, indeed.  Thanks to, uh, BlackBerry's technology and not using the garbage iPhone, you don't have  to be stuck with the memory that's internal of the phone.  You can upgrade it to whatever you'd like.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, now you could lose a mini SD card.  That's right. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Here we go.  iPhone killer.  Fuck you.  It's a goddamn upgradable, too.  The BB torch, baby.  Yeah, and it's actually reliable and you can make a phone call on it.  It sure is.  Oh, Kenya.  Kenya.  It sure is.  Wow.  Face.  Wow, you got us.  Yeah, this guy's face in the whole town.  Wow.  But if you want to just keep continuing on the bandwagon of everybody that loves the iPhone,  that's completely up to you, Ant.  Yeah, bandwagons of people that are happy with and fucking love what it can do. 
[02:18:30]  The multitude of apps that are available for it.  So you think Ant's on the bandwagon, buddy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think there's a lot of people on the bandwagon and it's unfortunate.  Yeah, there are a lot of people on the bandwagon because it's a popular fucking phone because  it works and it works well.  Nope.  No.  I've tried my iPhone.  I tried an iPhone.  No, you didn't.  Didn't like it.  You didn't try it.  Paper toss.  Paper toss.  I did paper toss.  And you liked paper toss. 
[02:19:00]  I did like paper toss on the iPhone.  Sir, you have the BlackBerry torch or you have an older BlackBerry?  I've used the torch already.  I still carry my non-slide.  But that's probably the only part of the torch I'm down with.  Which one do you have, sir?  9700 bold.  Hey, does the BB torch there, the BlackBerry torch, HD video?  Probably not, right?  No HD on the video.  That's the one you have.  We're looking at a picture of it.  The fucking...  Shut up.  How do you use that little screen? 
[02:19:30]  That's fucking...  You can make a phone call.  Hey, that's my phone right there on the screen.  9700.  That's really...  Moving up to the torch today.  Wow, that's great.  Yeah.  Wow, look at the screen.  It's a nice screen.  Nice size screen, right?  Oh, it's so vivid.  Oh, rainbow all the way.  All the way.  Dude, I'm telling you, you got to stop with the buttons.  This is enough.  Dink.  It's 2010.  Fucking 10.  Stop with your buttons.  I like to hit buttons. 
[02:20:00]  Some of us are concerned with reliability.  Stop lumping yourself.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, reliability.  Oh, that's right.  You got him on that one, bro.  Reliability.  The back of my phone is cracked and it works well.  Exactly.  I like how he's lumping himself in with a big group.  Fantastic.  You know what?  How many upgrades?  Two upgrades in two months because the software is inferior in comparison.  You know what I'm...  Inferior to what?  You know what I'm...  You know what I'm doing?  Oh, Travis?  No, I just want to know how many iPhones he's owned.  Yeah, how many have you owned? 
[02:20:30]  How many have I owned?  Yeah.  One of each one.  I'm disappointed with all of them.  One of what?  See?  See?  One of each generation iPhone.  See, he moved on from the iPhone.  Why do you keep buying it then?  I'm an employee, so I don't have to buy them.  I'm handed them.  That's right.  Oh, right.  What company hands out iPhones?  Fantastic excuse.  Not many companies hand out iPhones.  My girlfriend made me watch it.  Yeah, yeah.  So you like the BlackBerry...  Look at the...  So you watch videos on that screen?  Yeah.  Oh, in HD? 
[02:21:00]  Not in HD.  Oh, right, right.  They have it beat.  Yeah, that sucks.  If I used my phone solely for entertainment, then I would be a little more concerned.  Well, you know what?  It's there for entertainment, for computing, for texting, messaging, Facebook.  It's there for everything now.  Oh, no.  Not on an iPhone.  Bro, what the fuck is BBM?  No one gives a fuck.  No one cares about BBM.  I care about BBM.  Yeah, thank you.  I thought that was big BBM of them. 
[02:21:30]  What corporate fan guy?  Hang in there, Tyler.  You're doing good.  We're taking down the iPhones.  You're running on the antiquated technology if you're still relying on the text.  There's no insurance.  It's a delivered message.  That's right.  They're even responding.  I've never had a problem with a text not going through.  I'm getting a...  Size limits on your picture messaging.  What?  Blackberry messaging will allow any kind of size.  No size.  Oh, so you could...  Yeah, because you're looking at it on a fucking postage stamp size fucking screen, dummy. 
[02:22:00]  Ooh.  Oh, that must be great when you get a picture over there and look and you need a fucking loop  so you can see the picture.  Blackberry messenger is really cool because it's kind of like texting except you could only  do it with people with other Blackberries.  Yeah, I like that.  Wow, that's great.  Yeah, we don't want to be bothered with other phone users.  We're our own fraternity.  I love how people are mad at each other over whose phone is better.  I'm getting a Blackberry torch today and then tomorrow I'm getting a Droid.  No.  Yes. 
[02:22:30]  Just buy them all.  Just to be...  I'm buying every phone except for the iPhone.  Yeah, you stay away from that iPhone.  You know, the thing that everybody fucking stands online to buy every time they put a new  one out.  You'd be a lemming.  Jim, the only reason why I don't like this guy is because he's calling a touch screen  antiquated technology when he's using a Blackberry that came out a year ago.  With buttons.  I'm not saying we shouldn't hate him.  Antiquated technology.  He's a hateable man.  Will you stop saying antiquated?  It's great.  Well, we are a very pathetic country when we get excited and frustrated over comparing 
[02:23:00]  phone technology.  Exactly.  Yeah, I can't...  Don't put it in your phone.  You called in.  Yeah, put the fucking phone in your pocket and accidentally call someone, would you?  Am I the last holdout on the iPhone thing?  Yeah.  I was also...  I mean, I hate to be the bearer of bad news in a bandwagon jumper.  Yeah.  But to the people who are getting...  I love that.  Oh, that's right.  To the people who are getting the torch because it can make phone calls, it is an AT&T phone.  It's the same...  Same network.  Same exact fucking service. 
[02:23:30]  So they'll make the same amount of phone calls.  I've never had a problem with my AT&T.  Neither have I.  Although I have.  Although I had to get a phone for my apartment because I couldn't get reception.  But besides that, it's been pretty good.  They need one more tower on your roof.  By the way, you guys were saying I was crazy when I was bashing.  Not you, UO, but when I was attacking AT&T, everybody was like, my phone, Bob Kelly.  He's like, Dad, it's fine.  You make a call.  And all of a sudden, the whole country fucking caught up.  AT&T is shite.  Really? 
[02:24:00]  Shite.  I don't have...  I get dropped calls, but never any more than I got with every other service I've used.  I've had them all, my friend.  Verizon, Sprint, MCI, Bell.  I got to tell you, it's all BlackBerry support on the phones today.  All BlackBerry support.  I don't care.  It is not.  It sure is.  Those sissy bitches.  Oh, wait.  This guy wasn't supporting.  Hold on.  Get my language.  Get rid of him.  Oh, shake it, dude. 
[02:24:30]  Droid.  I'm buying a droid tomorrow.  And I'm buying a fucking torch tomorrow.  Today.  Which droid, though?  Because there's 75 different ones.  Oh, really?  The good one.  That guy.  Just looking.  The bestest one.  Just looking at that fucking picture.  Dude, I got it right here, man.  I know, but look at it.  There's buttons and there's fucking...  It's stupid.  There's no touch screen.  And I don't appreciate this one guy saying I lost my cred because I bought a Pebble. 
[02:25:00]  At the time, the Pebble was the fucking phone.  No, it wasn't.  It certainly was.  It was to make phone calls.  It looked cool.  And it was smooth.  I like how they spelled it, too.  But it didn't do anything.  Did it?  P-E-B-L.  I love that.  It made call...  Look, and you open it up.  It's like one of those fucking jitterbugs for old people.  I use my jitterbug.  I don't want to laugh at that, but...  It has one big 911 button in the middle.  The old hags. 
[02:25:30]  Look at...  But see, it was almost a...  It was almost a touch screen.  There wasn't really buttons.  Look.  Call an ambulance, you fucking hag.  I use the jitterbug.  I use my jitterbug.  Look at that pebble, man.  That thing fucking was...  Did it even have a camera?  That was a nice design.  Did it have a camera?  They really should be put down at a certain age.  They really have to be.  Oh, just...  Enough.  The pebble rocked.  We ought to give people a technology test, and if they can't pass it, they have to be  fucking killed. 
[02:26:00]  Just so we could get technology up to where it's supposed to be without having to keep  it at a lower level because people are stupid.  What happened to the pebble?  What happened?  What happened to the StarTac?  Hey, I had a StarTac.  I know you did.  Last week.  On eBay, people are paying upwards of $40 for a pebble.  There you go.  That's a collector's item.  What?  This...  Yeah.  I was going to say, I had a really bad one. 
[02:26:30]  Never mind.  Just try it.  If you bomb them, so what?  No.  Come on.  They were buying them so they could throw them Palestinians.  Palestinians are buying them to throw a Jew?  That's not bad.  That's pretty good.  I don't have confidence in it, though.  I bailed.  All right.  Can we take a break?  Yeah.  We got some horror coming in we got to get ready for.  And by that, we mean our agent.  Bobby's been stopping it. 
[02:27:00]  Guys.  Yes, guys.  It's...  It's...  What do you need, Drac?  All right.  All right.  So I won that argument.  Blackberry rules.  I found it sucks.  Right?  Yeah.  I don't think you won that argument.  I think it was...  What, Kenny?  I got a Blackberry.  Enough said. 
[02:27:30]  I just lost the argument.  Yeah.  That's...  It's gone now.  Droid.  Yeah.  So far, if you got a Blackberry and a droid, so far the only people who haven't come over  to the iPhone are Kenny, Erock, and Steve C.  You're in great company there, my friend.  I'm sorry.  I just got both.  A droid...  That's what I'm saying.  Steve C. has a droid in the Blackberry.  I don't get a droid.  Yeah.  Steve's the droid guy.  Yeah.  I'm not going to get a droid then.  How about this? 
[02:28:00]  Would you like to sleep next to my cum stain?  What the hell's wrong with you?  Goddamn, Jimmy.  What a giant picture of you smiling with your head next to the cum stain.  Jesus.  You're very happy about that cum stain.  Hey, did we ever find Bubba Watson crying?  Was it worth playing?  It wasn't playing for me, but we can give it a shot.  Give it another try?  If you're playing well, you're making a lot of saves. 
[02:28:30]  A lot of saves.  And you made some good ones today.  How much of that, making those par saves, adds to your mental...  Whatever.  We'll figure it out for after the break.  For me and Anthony Shaw, on the virus, Sirius XM.  You're breaking me down.  You're breaking me down.  And beating me down to nothing.  He's tearing me down  You're breaking me 
[02:29:00]  And beating me down to nothing  Yeah!  Welcome back.  So E-Rock did the right thing.  OA photos on Twitter.  He posted that picture of the guy that's now a girl.  Oh.  Or just the Vag.  The Vag picture.  Maybe more.  Maybe there's more in that gallery.  I don't know.  But old school photos can be found at OA photos on Twitter. 
[02:29:30]  Pretty good idea actually.  Yay!  Gives you a nice  Nice  I don't know.  Nice whatever the fuck.  Very distracted lately.  Very distracted.  Whatever the fuck.  It gives you an idea of what we used to get away with.  I guess what I was sort of trying to say.  Lots of stuff.  Alright so what else is going on in the world today?  Oh my god.  Yeah?  It's gotta be all kinds of... 
[02:30:00]  Nothings?  No.  Not a god damn thing.  Really?  I'm so just ready for fucking...  I'm very angry at the Ford dealer.  Oh.  I got a fucking voicemail.  You know this has been going on forever with my Shelby.  Oh.  Do you remember when my alternator went out two months ago?  Yeah.  And I had them fix it. 
[02:30:30]  Mm-hmm.  And then they came to me with an offer to put a Kenny Bell performance kit in.  And I'm like, you know something?  I'll use a little more horsepower.  Mm-hmm.  And this is a sanctioned Shelby modification place.  Sure.  Can you break down right by the place?  Yeah, yeah.  And then I'm like, okay, how long will that take?  You know, because I kind of want my car.  And just, you know, a week or two.  Why do you want your car?  Summer's not a good time to drive a Shelby.  No, no, no, not at all.  Absolutely, you're wrong. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, literal Jim.  Oh, sarcastic Ope.  Asshole Ope and sarcastic Ope.  It's literal Jim.  So they put the mod in.  And it took forever.  Because they told me at first it was just going to take two weeks.  They got two of the kits in.  And one's going in one car.  One will go in mine.  And then when they start the work, after I agree to it,  then I find out that some of the parts are backordered.  Like, they knew it.  Why didn't you fucking tell me initially? 
[02:31:30]  And then there's all kinds of other things that just,  I keep calling and saying, I'm coming up to get it.  Coming up to get it this weekend.  Ah, it's not ready.  We need a belt.  We need this.  We need the bigger injectors.  We need this.  And now I just got a fucking message.  It's probably ready now, though, right?  What?  It's ready now for you, at least.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.  It's all ready to go after they replaced the fucking main computer in it, 
[02:32:00]  which God only knows what that'll fucking cost.  Because as they were testing it on the dynamometer,  something went wrong.  They're diagnosing it.  And I think it's the main fucking computer that runs your motor.  How long have you had this car?  Since 2007.  So how in three years is that not under warranty, the main computer?  Well, when you mod it out to a Super Snake, it voids your warranty.  Oops.  Yeah.  I don't mind that. 
[02:32:30]  But the thing is, it was fine.  That was fine until I sent it to them.  Everything worked except the alternator.  If you put a mod kit on it and something fucks up, that should not be my responsibility.  It's still in their shop when it fucked up.  I wasn't driving it.  Yeah, that's true.  You know, it's like, so I get that.  And then the guy, this Dennis guy, is in Detroit until like Monday or Tuesday. 
[02:33:00]  I was, silly me, thinking after two fucking months, I could pick it up this weekend  and drive it back down from Rhode Island.  But now, no.  Now it's up there again.  I'm going to get this back in fucking winter.  When I can't even use it.  The thing is, too, they probably know your warranty is voided, so you'd have to just pay for it.  They know that.  Well, if they're pulling shenanigans like that, it's Tasker Ford up in Rhode Island. 
[02:33:30]  They're the only other Shelby, like, certified fucking mod place.  And, you know, I should have just sent it out to Vegas.  Or I should have just left it alone.  You just fucking try and you get fucked over.  Every time.  No matter what you try to fucking do.  I should have just had them put the alternator in and take it fucking home.  And if I wanted to mod it again, just send it out to Vegas again.  How's the alternator fucked up after three years?  Is that normal? 
[02:34:00]  I don't think it happens.  I mean, whatever.  It's the alternator.  I have no problem with the fucking alternator.  I got a problem with them fucking having my car for two fucking months.  I bet you they're driving it.  You pricks.  You think they're driving it all up?  They have a shitload of cars to drive if they need to fucking drive cars up there.  It's fucking making me crazy now.  They're probably using your car for a loaner.  Like someone else's car is in and they're just giving them yours.  And they give them...  How great with that bitch.  Dude, I am so pissed right now.  The ass trader's got fucking cigarette butts in it.  It's just a loaner. 
[02:34:30]  Jerry curl on the roof.  For everybody else.  Oh, great.  Oh, that would be hilarious.  Oh, that would fucking annoy me.  Oh, my God.  They put decals on the rear window.  It says, task a Ford.  You know, Ant just doesn't drive it right.  Look, I will fucking...  All right.  You're gone.  You're gone.  You're gone.  M-E-R.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Don't care if you were kidding or not.  You think I need to look at that right now?  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Why would you say you don't drive it right?  I'm sure you drive it right, right?  Of course I do. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, they're saying, you know, they're doing a Ferris Bueller on you.  Yeah, the old Ferris Bueller.  Thank you, happy butt from Ann Arbor.  Something like that.  That sucks.  God damn it.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  They just have you.  It's bullshit.  It just sucks all around.  Yeah, I think they are fucking me over.  They've had it for two fucking months, and it's not finished?  Task a Ford?  Maybe they're spinning back the mileage, and they've got to...  Yeah, it takes a lot of them to run it in reverse up on blocks. 
[02:35:30]  In the big glass garage.  How's the main computer not good?  Into the woods.  I don't know.  How'd that just go out?  They've had it for two months.  They've had it for two months.  It was fine.  And all of a sudden, the main computer's no good.  The last test they're doing on the dyno to see what it's putting out, then they have  this problem, and it turns out to be the computer?  That ain't my fucking fault, motherfucker.  Right.  That's them putting the fucking thing on the dyno, and fucking, uh, it goes out.  It's in their shop when it happened.  I wasn't driving it.  That ain't my fucking problem. 
[02:36:00]  I am really fucking livid.  They're getting a fucking call.  He calls me during the fucking show.  Call him right now.  No.  Well, just listen in.  No.  I don't think you're really livid.  No.  Oh, I'm very fucking livid.  Believe me.  Well, look to your right.  You won't be livid anymore.  Are you livid still?  Yeah, I'm still fucking livid.  Yeah.  Who cares?  A little fucking girl walking down the hall with a pregnant dress on.  I hate those pregnant dresses. 
[02:36:30]  It's the style.  No, it's a sundress that fucking, the elastic shit is right under the tits, so it pops out.  It's a pregnant look dress.  Then it looks potato sack-ish at the bottom.  And then they do that new thing.  I'm not really a fan of that either.  Or it's a little poofy at the bottom.  The poofy potato sack-y thing at the bottom.  Dang.  Hey, uh.  Mad.  Jimmy, remember you were talking about swastikas and how these brave kids do it in the middle  of the night?  We got one of those stories.  Remember?  I did read that.  Yeah, these fucking long-isles faggages.  This is exactly what you talk about.  Yeah, the cowards. 
[02:37:00]  A swastik is painted on garage doors of Long Island Home.  A family in Selden.  Yeah.  Selden.  Anyone have any paint remover?  My hands are a little dirty.  Get it?  I've been painting the swastik.  A family in Selden.  I hope a Jew with no sense of humor is the one fixing your fucking Shelby.  And now keying it.  Rosal Finkelstein says your Shelby needs a new computer.  The only Jew mechanic in the whole country.  You're right.  I stand corrected.  They're calling, uh. 
[02:37:30]  They love you, but they're saying your car's a piece of shit.  I agree.  Go fuck your mother's assholes.  Car's a piece of shit.  Eat me.  It's a lemon.  Good car.  The place is fucking me.  You're Team Ford, huh?  I'm Team Ford.  That's too bad.  Unless, like, it's an SUV, then I have some Team fucking GM.  Yeah.  I'm Team Cadillac.  BMW.  Oh, fuck it.  I'm a big hit.  Uh, family in Selden.  Long Island woke up Thursday to messages of hate painted on their home and their car in flames. 
[02:38:00]  I mean, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck could these people have done?  Wow.  Well, what could they have done?  And it's a nightmare they've lived through before.  Swastikas were painted on the garage doors, and their Jeep Cherokee burned in the driveway shortly after midnight.  What do you think of this, Jimmy?  It's just fucking, it's these faggot teenagers, or just these wannabes who don't have the guts to confront you face to face.  Anyone that spray paints in the middle of the night and runs away is a fucking coward.  It makes me angry, annoyed, frustrated. 
[02:38:30]  Homeowner Alex Romo said, I had, uh, I had painted that over.  Now I'm going to have to paint it over again.  They ought to just set up cameras.  They weren't such cheap.  Oh.  Oh.  Dan?  That's actually the thing, though, because I was listening to this story yesterday, and  the victims actually aren't Jewish.  They're, like, Hispanics, so they don't understand why they're being the target of these hate crimes.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they're not.  They're not Jewish.  You're right.  Interesting. 
[02:39:00]  Why would you paint swastikas on a Hispanic place?  Because there's nothing else they can think of.  They don't know how to paint a chupacabra.  Yes, it's very hard to paint somebody stealing a hubcap.  They don't know how to spell chupacabra.  Chupacabra.  There's just no reason to be painting swastikas.  Fucking faggots.  They never look good spray-painted, either.  It's just, what are you doing?  Don't look as regal as they looked on a flag.  Shuk-shuk-shuk-shuk-shuk-shuk-shuk. 
[02:39:30]  Is anybody coming?  Shuk-shuk-shuk-shuk-shuk.  I hope nobody sees me, white power.  Be lookout.  Yeah, you can see, we're looking at a spray-painted swastika  over Congressman David Scott's entrance sign.  And you can tell they really, really did it quickly.  No real work went into it.  It's a little S-like. 
[02:40:00]  No sharp right angles.  And the final line is the way the news makes a big deal about it.  That's why they keep doing it.  Oh, yeah, of course.  That's what we did.  All the backwards ones are great, too.  I don't know.  That's good.  More swastikas.  That guy takes time to square off his edges.  There you got that.  There's a good one.  That's awful.  It's just ridiculous.  People are so stupid. 
[02:40:30]  Ridiculous.  Real brave.  That's just giant, red, spray-painted letters on a big cement wall.  It says, fuck Jews, with a big swastika.  I mean, what's the purpose?  I love Jimmy's take on it.  People are just...  I love it.  There's no courage there.  Middle of the night cowards.  Middle of the night cowards, yeah.  Oh, God. 
[02:41:00]  Tummies.  What else is going on?  You're mad at that.  Very angry.  Ugh.  Yeah, I...  Hey, is the broad here?  She's coming up right now.  Is that the broad?  She's coming up.  She's short.  Oh, is she?  Is that the broad?  Is that the broad?  Daniel Staub.  Did I say Daniel again?  Staub.  How do you say her name?  Daniel.  Danielle.  Danielle Staub is here.  Oh. 
[02:41:30]  Hold on.  Should we take a quick break so we can clear the field?  We just...  Well, she's all the way down there, just wandering around.  I'm going to talk.  Steve's just talking to her.  Shut up, Steve.  And then maybe you could link to my website.  Bring her in.  Want some shitty DVDs?  You think he's offering her shitty DVDs right now?  Is he bringing her in?  I don't know what the fuck is going on, man.  Sam, what's going on?  Sam, what's going on down the hall? 
[02:42:00]  Our guest just arrived, and our esteemed executive producer is seeing to make sure that they  don't need anything.  Why'd you just bring her in?  Yes, hang out here for a while.  Tell them to just bring her in.  You got it.  What's he doing?  Who's...  Maybe he is.  Oh, she's the other one.  Oh, my God.  She's wearing clothes that she's way too old to be wearing.  I like that.  This is going to be so awkward.  Is that the...  Oh, dude.  She's fucking sexy.  Who's she with? 
[02:42:30]  You think she's sexy to me?  Wait till you see the Botox.  I don't care.  Oh, God.  This ain't going to be good.  Oh, my God.  Look at her face.  Oh, my God.  Her face fucking angers me.  You guys are fucking crazy.  What?  Dude, she's sexy.  Yeah?  Yes.  You digging it?  Yes, she will.  Ah, here we go.  Hello.  All right.  Oh, hi, hi.  How are you?  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you.  How are you?  Yeah, she is.  Let's take a seat next to our favorite person, Jimmy Norton. 
[02:43:00]  You got your boobs fixed, right?  Yes, I did.  I think I saw that on...  Good morning.  No, because I thought...  No, it's a beat, baby.  Well, because that was the last housewife I think I saw.  Yeah.  Because they were...  Your doctor said they were horrible.  Yeah, that was really...  The worst boob job you ever saw, and then he had to fix you up, right?  It wasn't the boob job that was bad.  It was the encapsulation.  Encapsulation.  Encapsulation.  What does that mean?  My body rejected the implants, and I waited a lot of years to get them fixed. 
[02:43:30]  Right.  Do they get hard?  I dated a girl whose...  She had fake breasts.  They got hard because they were over the muscle, and they should have been under the muscle.  I don't know what happened exactly.  It was eight years too long before I got them fixed.  How bad did they look?  How bad did they look?  Yeah.  Not as bad as people were describing them.  Well, they described them as square.  Square tits, I remember.  Yeah.  I don't even know.  That didn't make you happy.  No, it didn't make me happy, but it wasn't the worst things they said about me, so whatever.  Yeah, I watched... 
[02:44:00]  I think they should really be examining their own selves naked.  But they all hate you, though.  You know what?  Why do they all hate you?  I think that they hate themselves.  They see a little bit of me in them.  Oh.  They don't dare to do the things that they really want to do, so they have to hate me  for being able to do the things that I don't care, other people judging me for.  You're better looking in person, by the way.  Thank you.  Usually, it's the other way around.  Thank you.  You look better in person than on TV.  Thanks.  Yeah.  I appreciate that.  That's cool.  Is that cool?  Yeah, that's a really good morning to me. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, really?  It's good.  You get called a cunt a lot.  You know what?  I'm reading like...  It's so amazing to me that how people use that word so openly.  Like, do they even know what that means?  I mean...  Yeah, it means a cunt.  What does that mean?  It is.  You know, boys aren't supposed to say that, by the way.  No, they're not.  It's...  Oh, you know, I've known a lot of girls, though, over the years that have...  Have called you a woman?  ...heated that word.  No, oh, yeah.  I've been called them, believe me.  I've been called them much worse.  But I've known a lot of... 
[02:45:00]  It's like the atom bomb to some girls.  You know what?  It stops every argument.  You let it unravel you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, everything can unravel you.  I mean, there's a lot of words out there.  But, you know, I've been taking hits from every angle.  So, whatever.  How come everybody...  There seems to be a lot of negative press about you.  A lot of people bad-mouthing you.  You know what?  Only in the press venues that really don't count.  Think about the People Magazine ads, HollywoodLife.com, People.com, Us Weekly.  The big weeklies. 
[02:45:30]  The national five million readers.  Yeah.  It kind of makes Star look like a piece of shit.  To be honest with you.  Is this the case of...  I don't read the stuff that's negative.  And I don't talk to them.  They're blacklisted from even interviewing me.  But if they want to go negative, then they get one shot.  And then they don't get to talk to me again.  Oh, boy.  We better be careful.  Maybe.  Depends.  I mean, if you're being nice to me, I'll come back.  But if you're not, I'll give it back to you right away.  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  And then we'll see.  I think that's obvious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot...  I have a question about...  There's a lot of stuff that's been coming up about the past.  Now, is this a case of people making shit up?  Or is this just like you did a lot of crazy things and now here you are with some fame?  No, this is definitely a case of people making things up.  Fabricating.  Talking about shit that they know nothing about.  We have to ask.  What is the kidnapping that's been talked about?  Never happened.  Now, what happened that this person is saying it was a kidnapping?  I think, you know, it's obvious and to most, and there is going to be a cease and desist  order put on this person. 
[02:46:30]  I mean, they just keep coming out of the woodwork.  When you become a public figure, I don't like the word celebrity.  I don't like the word famous.  I just like to say public figure because I'm recognized everywhere I go.  And I like that.  I embrace that.  Yeah.  But when you become a public figure, everyone wants to ride along with it.  Oh, I knew her once.  So what's the most scandal?  Oh, they're tearing at her.  What can I come up with?  Oh, Jacqueline said this once on the show.  So let me go for the juggler with that.  Let me let me just breathe in people's ears for a minute and look at the people that are 
[02:47:00]  writing this stuff.  Was he an ex?  I don't know enough about was he he was he an ex an ex boyfriend or a guy you saw?  Nope.  He was just somebody you knew.  He was someone that actually did the things that he's telling me, telling the world that  I did.  Were you were you partying back then?  Was I partying back then?  I'm an ex partier.  So, you know, well, it was the 80s.  Yeah, I owned up to a lot of things in my book and we'll leave it at that.  Read my book.  Well, you have to give us a little bit like reading.  I enjoy a good read.  But is there stuff about drug use and stuff in here? 
[02:47:30]  Absolutely.  What kind of drugs did you enjoy?  I personally alcohol, a little bit of cocaine.  The one thing I didn't like alcohol and I really didn't like cocaine.  Believe it or not, I liked marijuana.  OK, that was your main drug.  Yeah, I was.  Do you still smoke?  No, no, no, no.  It's been really since the arrest, which was 86.  Yes.  Nineteen eighty six.  OK, that's a while ago.  So you got arrested.  Yeah.  I mean, the things that that really happened in my past are so far in my past prior to 
[02:48:00]  it's prior to marriage.  It's prior to children.  Yeah, you're a different person.  It's I am.  And, you know, and if that wasn't enough to change me, I think life kind of changed me.  And then, boom, getting hit with it again and reliving it again and then writing my  memoir about all this stuff, because I got given an opportunity to.  Why do you say memoir like that?  Memoir.  I don't know.  I just sounds really sexy.  Memoir.  Memoir.  My memoir.  It's better than, yeah, my life story.  Whatever.  You know, it just sounds a little memoir. 
[02:48:30]  You're really rich.  What did your ex used to do?  I'm not really rich, actually.  I see the real housewives.  You're living in a really nice house.  You know what?  But your daughter's got everything.  You got everything.  They do have everything.  And I work really hard for that, writing my memoir.  No, but.  Paid for a little bit of that.  And also the real housewives.  Now you're famous for the TV show, but it seems like you had money before the TV show.  You know, my ex-husband, the father of my children, let's just be really clear about  that, was, yeah, very well off. 
[02:49:00]  It is very well off.  And, you know, but then I made my own way.  After divorce, I really took a lot of financial hits.  And I didn't file bankruptcy because of one reason.  I really wanted to teach my children how to try to get out of it.  So it's taking me nearly eight years now to try to get out of it.  And now I'm listing my house for sale because I have about $150,000 in debt still.  And that's not a lot for 48 years old, but a lot of it came from legal fees and things 
[02:49:30]  that happen during divorce.  And you don't realize what's going to happen when the money is kind of taken away because  I was taking care of the house and the home and the children for 16 years of my life.  And I'm not complaining.  It was the biggest blessing in the world to work my way out of this.  And it's going to happen.  Once the house sells, I'll be debt free.  That's great.  You said legal fees because there's still a defamation lawsuit by your ex.  How is that progressing?  I mean, are you still in the middle of that or has that been kind of...  Well, that's being handled.  There is going to be a countersuit filed pretty readily. 
[02:50:00]  But you have to pay for the lawyers both...  I do have to pay for attorneys.  A lot of my income is attorney's fees right now.  And that's okay.  Is that your daughter?  No.  My kids aren't with me.  Okay.  No, I wouldn't bring them here.  Oh, is that your...  Rumored?  Well, suppose you're going a little lesbo lately.  No, that's not my rumored.  That's not my rumored.  She's here, though, somewhere.  Oh, really?  No, I don't go anywhere without her.  Yeah?  It's just a rumor, though.  Is that a little closer, then?  You've decided to go lesbian? 
[02:50:30]  Real close.  Real close.  Real close.  Really?  I didn't decide on anything.  It's broad, man.  It's not a decision.  Now, the season finale of New Jersey Housewives, is that on when?  Monday or something?  Coming up?  I don't think...  You're suing somebody.  The finales, a couple...  I think we have a couple more episodes.  Oh, a few more?  Yeah, three more episodes, I believe.  Right.  You're suing whose daughter?  I forgot.  She has the big boobs.  I like her.  Oh, Jacqueline's daughter?  Yeah, Jacqueline has really nice boobs, nice face, and her daughter's a real twat. 
[02:51:00]  I'm just showing my knowledge of the show.  Is that okay?  Jacqueline is beautiful.  Is that correct?  Jacqueline is beautiful.  Jacqueline is beautiful, and her daughter needs a beating.  How old's the daughter?  17, 18.  19.  19, somewhere around there.  Why is she...  She pulled her hair.  It wasn't a big pull, though.  Let's be honest with each other.  It was, actually.  It didn't seem like it on TV.  Well, yeah, it did.  If you think about it, I was walking forward, and I was yanked.  My whole body went backwards.  Went backwards?  Yeah.  But you seem like a tough broad. 
[02:51:30]  You can handle something like that.  You know what, though?  Broad.  You know what?  She does, though.  You look like you can handle yourself.  It's a matter of, did it hurt?  Yes.  And it hurt a lot.  I'm not going to lie.  It pulled the hair literally from my head.  These extensions are beaded in, right up to my scalp.  Right.  And it's painful when 20 of these, this is one.  20 of those are attached to that much of my own hair, are ripped from your head.  20 of those were ripped?  Yes.  Yes.  All right, then what do I know?  And it hurts.  But more to the point, even if it didn't get pulled from my head, which it did, don't touch 
[02:52:00]  another person in violence.  I was trying to get away from them.  But some people say, some people say you should, you should, some people should mind  their own fucking business.  But some people are saying that you should understand because you were in trouble as  a, as a, as a young woman.  Yeah.  And I did my time.  And maybe you should just let her slide.  Uh, I asked for an apology.  Right.  Right down to the trial.  Right.  I got the big.  Really?  Right in front of the judge. 
[02:52:30]  Who's covering her legal fees?  Is the show covering her legal fees or no?  Does she have to pay for them?  Well, ironically, the show does not cover legal fees.  Not for stuff like that, I'm sure.  Not for anything.  But you guys are, you're bringing good TV with all this.  I bring awesome TV.  Yes.  Yeah.  Does your daughter like you?  My daughter?  Yeah.  My daughters both love me.  Well, because they, uh, what is it?  Bravo?  What, what channel is this on again?  Bravo.  Bravo.  It seems like they, uh, have shots of your older daughter kind of rolling her eyes at  times at mom.  Better rolling her eyes than chasing another person through a country club and pulling at them. 
[02:53:00]  Um, yeah, we all say things that embarrass our children.  We all say things that our children disagree with.  I have a 16 and a 12 year old daughter.  I've been a single mom for over eight years.  Is she still modeling?  She is actually.  Thank you for asking.  She's got, um, she's booked all of this all next week.  She's doing fashion week and she's going to Paris and Ivan Bard is handling her with  IMG alongside with Bradley Davis.  And she were, she's walked for Mark Jacobs.  Um, she's got the Johnson.  She's phenomenal. 
[02:53:30]  Um, both of my daughters.  I can't, I, I just, I did something right.  I don't like to pat myself on the back, but right there I will.  See?  Listeners have said, they're really good kids.  Listeners have said very fuckable daughter.  I will fucking destroy that fucking list.  I know.  Believe me.  Don't ever fucking use that word about my kid.  I don't like having to read it.  Well, don't then.  It disgusts me that our listeners are that blunt and, but it just pops by.  I'm twitching a little bit here.  All right.  All right. 
[02:54:00]  They send in.  That's my kid.  They send in feedback.  Yeah, yeah.  Feedback is flying up.  Which listener, Anthony?  We should, uh, we should call them out.  It's Cigars and Scotch.  Oh, Cigars and Scotch?  Yep.  I love when they use a name that's not even a name, but they're going to be so bold and say  shit like that.  Use your fucking name, motherfucker.  Be brave, Cigars and Scotch.  Be brave, Anthony.  Are you kidding me?  You're going to talk that kind of language and you're going to say, oh, Cigars and Scotch.  Use your real name.  Exactly.  I know.  That guy's been in trouble since he's been on this thing. 
[02:54:30]  He's trying to be fancy.  That's the only thing that will ever set me off.  Don't, don't come after my kids, man.  No, no, no.  His real name is Cigarette and Meisterbrow.  He's trying to be fancy.  His real name is Six Feet Under because he's drinking and smoking.  Drinking and smoking.  Drinking and smoking.  It'll kill you.  What do you think of Teresa?  Who?  From the fucking show.  Come on.  Let's talk some dirt here.  I know you don't like her.  I think.  She's got a bunch of daughters and I guess the husband did a little Dewey thing, but he's 
[02:55:00]  saying he wasn't drunk when he like flipped his car.  Okay.  Let's talk about that.  I'll talk about that one.  All right.  His excuse on the show.  I love it.  I love how they all get together and they make up an excuse.  I'm going to tell you the story.  But can I tell Jimmy so he knows?  Oh, you're going to fill him in?  Yeah.  Because he doesn't really know the show.  Teresa has this husband and he was, I think he was drinking and driving, but he claims  that he, wait, he crashes the car, then he goes into his father's house?  He drove into a telephone pole.  Right.  But was it moving or had it been stationary? 
[02:55:30]  The telephone pole was not moving.  No.  The telephone pole was stationary.  He was driving a moving vehicle.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  So, and you think he was drinking and driving?  That's why it was DUI, driving under the influence.  Okay.  So, then the crash is right outside of his father's house?  Someone's house that he knew.  Someone's house that he knows.  So, he goes into the house.  Or he made that up.  And claims that the reason why they think he was drinking and driving, he was so shooken  up by the accident that he started doing fucking shots as soon as he got into this person's  house.  Now, wouldn't all you do that after you call the police?  Wouldn't you all get wasted while you're waiting for the cops to come? 
[02:56:00]  No.  Okay.  A little old Jim.  I got to tell you, hold on, hold on, I got to tell you, but I got to tell you something.  I like that.  I put that excuse in the back of my head.  That's a good one.  Yeah, but you know what?  Find someone's house and just start doing it.  Oh, they didn't?  No.  No.  All right.  Tell us the story.  Copped in by it.  He was charged.  So, here's the thing.  All of them get together and make up stories about me and some of the world buys it because  all of them can't be wrong about just one of me.  Now, do they hang out with me? 
[02:56:30]  No.  So, do they know anything about me?  Absolutely not.  But let's just think for a moment that this was true.  All of them get together, come on the show, and say, yeah, no, Joe wasn't drinking.  Ten of us split one bottle of wine.  One bottle of wine.  Have you seen him without a drink in his hand all season?  No.  A lot of wine drinking.  A lot of them, right?  Okay.  So, they're all sitting there.  Jacqueline, has she been without a drink all season?  No.  She's a luss.  Okay, here's the thing.  All of them, all of them, split ten of them. 
[02:57:00]  Split one bottle of wine.  And I'm buying that, first of all.  Second of all, I love, I love, love, love how Jacqueline's face was like this.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, it was one bottle.  Like, she's going, I don't even believe this, but okay, I'm going along with it.  So, Joe says, yeah, so I hit the pole, you know, because I yawned, because I'm tired.  Two o'clock in the morning, I yawned, and I closed my eyes for a minute. 
[02:57:30]  Because he was yawning.  Because I was yawning.  And I hit a telephone pole.  Not because I was drinking and yawning, but because I yawned and closed my eyes for a minute, because I'm tired.  So, what'd you do, take a nap?  You're going to take a nap for a brief moment.  All right, take a nap, because you're sober.  You take a nap when you're sober, right, and you're driving a vehicle.  Buying it.  Then, after he hits the telephone pole, calls the police.  While he's waiting, he goes, hey, there's Joe Schmuck's house.  Let me go have a few drinks with Joe Schmuck, because I'm going to wait for the cops here.  Well, because he was all shit.  Pounds down some green Jack Daniels, or whatever it is, Johnny Walker. 
[02:58:00]  Because he was shooken up by the accident.  Oh, yeah, well, that's what I'd be doing at two o'clock in the morning.  He needed to calm down a little bit.  Yeah, you got it down a few.  That's logical.  He was soberly driving home, and the man yawned, as many of us will, for a minute or two at a time.  And you hit a telephone pole, and you go have a few drinks while the police are on their way.  Yeah.  That's a perfectly logical explanation.  Isn't that great?  Yeah.  I love that people are buying this.  And, uh...  It's great.  It's great.  It just shows you how incredibly ignorant people can be.  And are they going bankrupt, Teresa and her husband, Joe?  Well, according to court documents, which don't lie, is what they said about me, right? 
[02:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  $11 million going bankrupt.  Yeah.  Wow.  I have a question about...  Because there's obviously this tape out called...  But I don't wish it on them.  The bankruptcy thing, I want to acknowledge for a second.  I just want to touch on it, and then we'll go to where you're going, because I know where  you're going.  That's a sexy town.  But in a moment, we'll go there.  But anyway, I don't think that it...  I didn't take any kind of pleasure in hearing that. 
[02:59:00]  I think it's really...  It's sad, and I really do wish them all the best trying to get out of that, because that's  something you...  They got four kids, man.  Do you like them as people, though?  No.  See, when you...  Absolutely not.  People I don't like, I root for bankruptcy.  That's karma.  Well, Teresa comes...  That karma's coming.  Teresa comes across a bit obnoxious.  A bit?  Yeah, a bit obnoxious.  Yeah, a bit.  You hate her?  I don't hate her.  That's a strong word.  All right, but if you could spit on her, would you?  I strongly dislike her.  No, because...  Hate's not a strong word.  That's an easy one.  It is.  It is a strong word. 
[02:59:30]  I could give you a list of people I hate.  You don't want her dead.  No problem.  But if she lost a couple toes in a lawnmower...  Right.  Yeah, what would you wish on her?  I don't take pleasure in other people's pain.  Believe it or not, I really don't.  Yeah?  I really, really don't, because I've had a painful life, and I don't wish it upon anybody.  But here's the thing.  You do get your karma back, and theirs is coming.  I keep saying that.  And it's here.  $11 million in debt.  It's here, but it's not a funny situation for them, and I hope that they work their way  out of it.  I really do.  Hey, we got a huge fan of the show on the line. 
[03:00:00]  Yes, sir.  You got a question?  Yeah, this is Yingy's man.  I was wondering, is it true your daughter loves anal sex?  Oh, stop it.  Dude, that's...  What the fuck?  Dude.  That's a...  She's being called.  Did you cut him off, please?  Yeah, why don't you give you a guess?  Yeah, I cut him off.  Why don't you give your real name?  I'm still here.  Oh, tie a hang up on this guy.  Sorry about that.  How did the...  He wanted to ask a question about the bankruptcy, so he tricked us.  I'm sorry about that.  It's called Danielle Staub Raw. 
[03:00:30]  Now, it's a porn tape by Hustler, I guess.  Sex tape.  It's you.  No, it's fine.  It is, it's great.  Are you making money from this?  No.  So this is basically...  How is that legal to take a tape of you having sex?  Oh, public figure.  I couldn't stop it.  But you were taped...  This is the first I've seen it, actually.  But how did it get stolen?  Oh, boy.  You were taped with your knowledge?  Was it taped with your knowledge?  Oh, this was, yeah.  I was...  I was...  Who's the guy?  I was in...  She was that girl.  Yeah, this is me. 
[03:01:00]  No, no, I know.  Oh, you were...  Who's the guy?  I'm not going to disclose the guy.  Okay, but didn't he screw you over?  No.  Well...  No, no, no.  Literally.  Oh, the guy didn't?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Nope.  So who stole it?  How could someone...  If it was you and him...  This is the first time I'm seeing this.  This is just...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You look very sexy.  I mean, if it's any consolation.  Yeah.  I think you're lovely.  This is really awkward.  How did we get that, by the way?  Just staring at the tape.  I don't know.  I didn't realize.  I thought you were actually making money off it.  No.  Could you sign that, please? 
[03:01:30]  How terrible and heavy.  If you pay me.  It's like, hey, could you sign it?  That's really the first time you're in tape.  Yeah, if you pay me, I will.  Then I can say I actually made a dollar from it.  Give me a dollar and I can say now I'm making money from it.  Wow, man.  I'll give her a dollar to sign it.  You know what?  Then I was going to be completely wrong.  I thought you knew that it was a fake stealing situation and you're making money off this.  No.  You're not making a dime off the tape.  I haven't made a dime off the tape.  So wait, you're with this guy.  Let's just say he was a guy.  Somebody steals it out of where?  Your place or his place?  Oh, it wasn't in my possession. 
[03:02:00]  Okay, so it was probably in his possession.  It was stolen.  So basically, this is stolen property which has been released.  How is that legal?  Nothing is legal.  None of that stuff that's said about me is legal.  But when you're a public figure, back to that, everyone can take their shots at you unless you can afford the hundreds of thousands of dollars it's going to take to shut that down.  Just a cease and desist.  Yeah.  You don't shut that kind of stuff down for free.  And not for nothing.  I'm just trying to get myself out of debt.  So why would I spend my money doing that? 
[03:02:30]  Whatever.  Take your shots at me.  Whatever.  No, my question is like why would somebody – it's almost like even if you're a public figure, they're putting out a stolen item here.  It's almost like if you steal somebody's watch and then you're on eBay going, hey, I have Danielle Straub's watch.  That's stolen.  Even though you're famous, that's a stolen watch.  So how are they putting this out?  How is this legal for them to put this out?  Like you have to be able to put a cease and desist on this.  Well, then I'd have to come up with the money to do so.  Yeah, sometimes you've got to weigh it out.  It's not free.  It's not worth it for me anymore. 
[03:03:00]  I'm not fighting the fight and spending legal fees.  I'm going to enjoy my public figure-ness.  I'm going to enjoy my status as a person and I know who I am.  This was a long time ago.  This is not what I wanted – I intended for this to do.  I really just want to get on with my life and go to the next step.  But I have an idea.  I'm not going to spend money – put good money into bad.  I'm just not going to do it.  If you're involved in litigation over the girl pulling your hair –  That was the prosecutors. 
[03:03:30]  That's the state of New Jersey.  Oh, you don't have to pay for a lawyer for that.  No, the state of New Jersey, when cops show up and she says, yes, I did it, you admit it.  You admit it.  And when I went to drop the charges, the prosecutor said, you know, we can do this as long as –  what would it take for you to say?  Nothing for her record, nothing at all.  And I said an apology.  I'm sorry.  Two words.  I'm sorry.  Right.  And that's all it would have taken.  Oh, so you're not paying to litigate that?  Are you not suing her civilly?  Is it a civil suit or only the –  It's just – 
[03:04:00]  It's my phone.  That's right.  Oh, boy.  Is it civil?  It's civil.  Okay, so you're paying to litigate that then.  You have to pay for a civil suit, don't you?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, I'm sorry.  It's the state.  It's the state of New Jersey that was doing this.  Now, when she continued talking further about that, then my attorneys who were handling my matrimonial  and also my record label, they kicked in because it's starting to hurt me, my financial status as well,  and the people that I work with are getting affected by it if they just keep talking.  So their attorneys said cease and desist. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  They're the ones handling that, not me.  So why couldn't they fire out a cease and desist on this?  Because I think a threat –  Because this isn't hurting me.  This is not hurting me.  Oh, you don't mind it?  No.  Aren't you mad you're not making money off it?  Whatever.  It's you having sex.  Whatever.  I'm sure it's a very good video, but you should be making money off it.  That's my point.  If you don't mind it being out there, because now you're dancing, I think, right?  You're dancing as well?  Dancing.  Did you tell me scores?  Weren't you at scores?  I am a musician.  I got a party thrown for me. 
[03:05:00]  Oh, okay.  Our producer gave us the wrong information.  And I did a show, and who said sort of?  Our producer gave us – Anthony did.  What?  No, you threw him under the bus.  I didn't say shit, yo.  It was you.  It's that voice.  I was waiting for whoever doesn't own it, whoever calls somebody out, is the one that did it.  Just like I said at the first finale, she got up and ran.  She's guilty.  I kind of like you.  People that fly out of their chairs and throw people off and under the bus are the guilty  parties.  You are guilty.  You apologize to me right now. 
[03:05:30]  Apologize to me.  No, I don't like the song.  Apologize to me.  You don't have to like the song, but I work.  I like you, but –  I like the song.  You didn't like the –  No, you said you didn't like the song.  I did not say that.  We all said we didn't like the song.  We like you, though, as a person.  I would tell her, believe me.  All right, wait.  Let's play it.  All of us under the bus.  Five of us got on stage.  I like it.  The piano sounds amazing.  But you listened to –  Maybe you don't like the tortured lullaby version.  Maybe you would like the club version that I performed with five of us on stage at  scores.  Not just me.  I didn't strip.  I was fully dressed.  Steve C is an idiot. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, free Steve C.  We were invited to that event, but I had to work.  He said there was some kind of crazy –  I'll tell you.  Get him in here.  Yeah, let's get –  Hey, there is a club version of the song.  I don't got to strip to make money no more.  But I didn't –  Did you used to dance?  Yes, you did.  Yes, I did.  I'm very proud of being a stripper.  Cool.  Do you remember that –  Do you remember, like, making that tape?  Just asking.  You do?  Oh, yeah.  Was it good?  It was nice, right?  Was it fun?  I have to ask this because I'm going to get the tape anyway.  Does the guy have a large penis?  No?  I'm not answering that.  That's a no.  I'm not answering.  Yeah, that's a no. 
[03:06:30]  Nobody denies a big dick.  Nobody sits in your head.  Steve.  Yeah.  You said she was stripping at scores.  He said that you were stripping.  Were you there at scores?  This is Cigars and Scotch.  He said that –  You were at scores?  Well, I define at.  Were you at scores?  Well –  Were you at scores?  Were you one of the 500 people there?  Maybe.  You're lying.  There was five of the 500 people.  You're lying.  That's not very nice, Jim.  You're lying if you say I stripped and I took one garment off.  I was head to toe, fully dressed with a very low-cut top on and a backless top on. 
[03:07:00]  That's not exactly dressed.  Did you flash?  Did you flash at all?  Nothing.  I was taped completely in.  He said you did.  You apologize to me.  Say you're sorry, liar.  Apologize.  Yeah.  Apologize.  He lied.  It depends on your definition of tripping.  Apologize.  Apologize.  Apologize.  Apologize.  Do I have to?  Yes.  Just say you're sorry.  Yeah, I think you do, Steve.  Head to toe, fully dressed.  I have to.  Apologize.  But, you know.  I'm sorry.  Two words.  I'm sorry.  But you see.  And then I get it.  I'm sorry.  Say it.  No, I don't want to say that, Jim. 
[03:07:30]  Say I'm sorry.  I don't want to say that.  I didn't strip.  Say I'm sorry.  Why won't you say sorry if that's what you said?  Say I'm sorry.  You said she stripped.  You lied about me.  Say your side.  I'm sorry our definition of strip is different.  I'm sorry I lied is what you want to say.  I'm sorry you lied.  I'm sorry.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  No.  Oh, Steve.  You're out of control now.  That's right.  She's lying.  That's out of control.  Give him a titty twister.  Maybe it's in that name.  I don't know.  I wouldn't touch him with a 10-foot pole.  Oh.  Damn. 
[03:08:00]  Why wouldn't you touch Steve with a 10-foot pole?  Because he's a liar.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't like liars.  I don't like liars.  I'm shaking right now.  Say you're sorry.  Say you're sorry.  Kick him in the balls.  Oh, damn.  Can you kick him in the balls?  Ooh.  She doesn't like liars.  I'm not a violent person.  I have people that take care of that for me.  Oh, shit.  Leg breakers.  No.  No.  Yes.  No.  We just give him deadly looks.  Lawyers.  Lawyers.  There you go.  Say you're sorry.  You seem to like litigation.  Say you're sorry.  I do not like litigation.  I didn't say that. 
[03:08:30]  He did.  I can't stand it.  He said that one.  Again, he's pointing at me.  Did I say that?  Unbelievable, this Opie.  I didn't say that one.  No, it actually was your voice.  Yeah, it was.  That was your voice.  She's too good.  All right.  You got me.  I'm sorry.  I do this a lot.  What?  You need to say, I'm sorry.  You're sorry.  Ooh.  Now, say, I'm sorry.  Ooh.  And I'll let it go.  She's going to let it go if you just apologize.  But I didn't.  What is it about that?  Exactly.  I don't know.  He's not a man.  We all know that.  A real man would say, I'm sorry. 
[03:09:00]  I'm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just because I have a certain preference.  Look into her face and say, I'm sorry.  You're wearing a shirt.  You can't even look at me.  Yeah, look at her.  In your comfortably sized shirt.  Come on.  That's very not nice, Jim.  Oh, what you said about me was nice?  Exactly.  Ooh.  Look into her face.  I can't.  Ooh.  I can't.  Wow.  Steve has a problem with women, first of all. 
[03:09:30]  That's rough.  Steve doesn't like women.  He doesn't like women.  Well, I have a lot of boys that maybe I could introduce you to, but you'd have to say you're  sorry first.  Ah, ha, gay.  Oh, you're gay.  Ah, ha, gay.  Never come up before.  I love my gay community.  Love, love, love my gay community.  You like your gays.  But you need to say, I'm sorry.  You're sorry.  Whoa.  That's rough.  She hates liars, man.  Yep.  Well, she hates me, then.  I'm sorry.  Why can't you apologize to all the women?  I'm sorry you don't like me. 
[03:10:00]  See, I did it, because...  But why wouldn't you apologize to her?  Yeah, why would you say that?  She's a lovely lady.  She is lovely.  She's having fun with us.  But we just have a different...  She's taking a few shots.  ...of opinion, as opposed to...  Ladies and gentlemen, a text from Eastside Dave McDonald.  Eastside Dave McDonald.  Eastside Dave.  Daniella's a cunt.  Oh!  Let's see.  Oh, that's not cool.  Eastside Dave from the Ron and Fez show.  Why would he say that?  Why?  Because...  I guess because he likes Steve and doesn't like seeing Steve under this kind of... 
[03:10:30]  Thank you.  People probably work with you on that, Eastside Dave.  We meanwhile...  We meanwhile...  ...love seeing Steve in this position.  But we learned she's in it.  Or his doggy style with a dildo of his ass.  Am I supposed to know who Eastside Dave is?  That's private.  No, not really.  No.  Especially if you're management here.  He has no idea who he is.  So, to me...  He's a failed radio host.  To me, Eastside Dave, Westside Dave, whatever.  North, South.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I don't really give a shit.  Oh, shit.  See?  Good.  Buffangool.  Good.  Buffangool.  Did you just put a hit out on him?  You're a nice Italian woman?  I don't do that. 
[03:11:00]  Are you Italian?  I am.  Yeah, you can tell.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jersey.  How long have you been there?  Forever?  Actually, I lived in Jersey as a baby.  And then South Jersey, North Jersey.  Then moved...  I'm a geographical mutt.  I moved back 27 years ago.  From where?  26 years ago.  Where in Jersey?  Oh, yeah.  In 86, I moved back to Jersey.  From where?  Where were you?  That was when I left Miami.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Where in Jersey?  So, I've been in Jersey for a long time.  Where in?  Most of my life. 
[03:11:30]  I'm in North Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Wayne.  Oh, all right.  Oh, that's where the money is.  I dated a girl there.  William Patterson when I was 30.  Her name was William Patterson?  No, that's a college over there.  Yes.  No, his name was William, and I would...  All right.  Failed out.  Punched out.  Good idea.  Yeah.  For the real Housewives fans out there, how many more episodes have we got?  I think there's three more episodes.  And what have we got to look forward to?  And then probably 30 reunions.  Really?  Yeah.  It's going to be a long reunion.  Buckle up.  What do you mean?  There's going to be another season film? 
[03:12:00]  No, reunion is the show that's taped after we've seen what we've done to each other.  Right.  Behind each other's backs.  Well, mainly what I see when what all of them done behind my back or said about me behind  my back, and then I just get to go in and say, hey.  Can I ask an ignorant question?  Because I don't know the show.  I don't watch a lot of TV.  Ask.  What is...  It's a bunch of housewives who are living together.  What is like...  They're not living together.  No, we don't live together.  Oh, you don't live together.  Oh, thank God.  They all have separate mansions.  No, that's Jersey Shore.  Okay, separate mansions.  They live together. 
[03:12:30]  Separate mansions, and they just bitch, because they have nothing better to do with their  lives.  Actually, you don't hear me bitching.  You don't hear me once complaining about my life.  What is the point...  Not what is the point of the show in a shitty way, but what is the show about?  It's just four different houses.  The premises?  Yeah.  Kill Danielle.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what it's turned into.  Yeah, it has four different housewives.  Is it four that they focus on?  Yeah, and all it would take is, I'm sorry.  But people won't say they're sorry.  That's weird, man.  That's weird, man.  Oh, damn.  Oh, Steve.  Why don't you like women? 
[03:13:00]  He's like that.  Yeah, he really doesn't like women at all.  He took a shot.  I told her I didn't like her song, but it might not be my cup of tea.  That's all.  Yeah, at least he's got a reason behind it.  Thank you.  See?  When you lie, you get the back.  FitGuy4U1, ask her about her hairy box.  My what?  Uh, well, the pictures, I guess the pictures that are out there show, um...  They're not my pictures, sweetheart, but they're lasered for ten years.  Ah, shit.  Well then, fuck you, sir.  Another one.  And then I apologize. 
[03:13:30]  I love how they do that.  Let's superimpose something there and call it Danielle.  Ah, shit.  Your boobs are looking really good.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, they're not square anymore.  No, they're really quite amazing.  Yeah, Jimmy's been staring at them all the time.  Well, he wouldn't know that, right?  Because apparently I stripped the other night, right?  Yeah.  Did you strip, Steve?  Yeah.  Steve's an angry, angry man.  I'm going to show you pictures of me on stage when we're all done here.  Okay.  Ooh.  Yeah.  So you are...  The important thing here is you've been lasered for ten years.  How much did you laser? 
[03:14:00]  A little bit or a lot?  It was gone.  All of it's gone?  The whole thing?  Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.  That's great.  Gone like the wind.  That's really great.  I like that.  Did you laser all body hair?  Because you have none.  I have none.  Did you laser all of it?  Why not?  You had to.  Yeah, she's Italian.  What a good girl.  She had to be rid of that shit.  Feel that.  Okay.  No, keep going.  Oh, her legs are really nice.  My hand's a little chilly.  How far up could Jimmy go on your leg?  He couldn't go any further than my calf.  That's why I put my calf up there.  That was it.  Can I rub the calf?  Because I didn't rub the calf.  I rubbed the front, the bone part.  You can't rub anything else now. 
[03:14:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  Why?  He's a big star in his own right.  I'm a gentleman.  I'll be very nice.  Two big stars just rubbing each other.  Yeah.  You want to see my calves?  No, no, no, no, no.  How about we do this?  Look, look.  Look at Jimmy.  Look at his arms.  Could you touch his arms?  The hair is weird.  It's so wispy.  It doesn't feel like real hair on my arm.  Could you just touch it?  No, that's okay.  You've got to feel it.  It's weird.  That is like...  I know.  Just touch it.  That's strange.  No, that's okay.  You're not going to get anything.  I don't have the hiv.  No, no, I'm good.  Just touch it.  He touched you.  You touch him.  I don't... 
[03:15:00]  I don't...  No?  No.  Wow.  She doesn't like touching.  Why don't you...  You don't like Jimmy?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Actually, you're the only one that's been super, super, super nice.  Oh, no.  You have been...  But you've been reading the C word a lot.  So, no.  You're the only one.  I've been...  I've been...  I've been reading...  I've been nothing but a sweetheart through this whole process.  I'm just reading what...  And I'm the only one that knows the fucking show.  The listeners are saying...  Okay, then I have to like you most.  She smells really good, too.  She does?  What are you wearing?  It's actually Petite Cherie by Anikuta.  It's very clean.  Could Jimmy smell your armpit? 
[03:15:30]  No.  He has a thing for armpits.  I don't like deodorant.  I don't like when women wear deodorant.  Please.  You smell really good and clean.  But I would actually be cool if she was just really nasty smelling, too.  That'd be great.  Could he smell your armpit, please?  Why would he want to smell your armpits?  Because we've been talking about armpits today.  And I have a thing for them.  And it's a body chemistry thing.  I think it's very sexy, the smell.  Well, then, no.  Why?  I don't do anything...  No, no, no, no.  Why?  I don't do anything dirty.  It's just different people smell different.  She doesn't want to turn...  You know, be used to turn you on.  It's not going to turn me on.  It's not her job here, Jenny. 
[03:16:00]  We're not in a setting where I would get turned on.  We're sitting here on a radio interview.  Where's your lesbian lover?  Who?  The woman.  The woman.  My rumored?  Yeah.  Rumored.  Rumored.  She's around.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Does she do anything in public?  What are you talking about?  Like, has anyone ever seen her before?  She goes everywhere with me.  Everywhere with you.  And is there kind of a little romance thing going on between you and her?  A little licking?  Is it important?  Is it really important for people to know? 
[03:16:30]  There's scissoring going on?  Yeah, it's sexy.  Do you know if she's lesbian?  You become kind of a sex symbol now.  I mean, let's be honest.  You are.  This tape is going to sell because it's you and you look really great.  So, yeah, it's titillating, but it's interesting.  Titillating.  Interesting choice of words.  It's really sexy.  Let me handle this.  Do you push your genitals into each other?  That's a nice way to put it, right?  Oh, I don't know.  No?  Oh, my God.  What about your daughters?  Do they mind you have a lesbian lover?  Oh, I thought you were going somewhere else.  Hey! 
[03:17:00]  I was waiting to see some get thrown at you.  That's a pretty good question.  It's a very fair question because you're in the public eye.  I think that's a nice question.  Everything you do is under public scrutiny.  But I haven't confirmed or denied anything.  Yes.  You winked at me, and I got on tape, so I got confirmation today.  You've got a lesbian lover.  That's who is walking with you down the hallway, right?  Absolutely.  Yeah, she kind of has a look like she's...  Have you ever in your life hooked up with a girl?  I mean, most women do.  You have.  Yes.  I have owned up to that, too, if you'd read the book.  Why?  I couldn't read it yet, madam.  It just got here.  I might not read that fast.  That's knowledge. 
[03:17:30]  How come there's no photos in this book?  I like a lot of pictures.  Well, then you wouldn't read the words.  Really?  You wouldn't read the words.  You need to read the words.  You could go online for the pictures.  Can you?  With the superimposed bush.  Yeah, there you go.  Exactly.  For the superimposed pictures.  Is this your lesbian lover on the cover of your single, Real Close?  Her name is not lesbian lover.  Actually, Andy named her a lesbian superstar.  Lesbian superstar.  Yeah.  That means she does some good things.  Yeah, what's her name? 
[03:18:00]  You have to tell us her name.  We don't want to refer to her.  Her name is Lori Michaels.  Can we say hi to her?  Say hi.  Yeah, where is she?  Bring her in.  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  Why?  No.  Why?  Because she doesn't handle this stuff the way I do, so.  Oh, really?  I'd be very nice to her.  That's okay.  Just curious.  I got this.  She does not want her in here.  You have a lot of haters.  What do you say to your haters?  I have Becky.  Keep talking about me because it makes me more and more and more desirable.  Becky, you're on.  Keep talking, baby.  You're on with.  Becky, okay, girl. 
[03:18:30]  All right, Becky.  You're on with Stob.  I'm on with what?  You're on with Stob.  Now we're down to just last names now, huh?  Okay, I see how you are.  All right, Becky, go ahead.  I think she's the biggest cunt, and I'm so glad to say her.  Oh, not that word.  Take her off.  Take her off.  No, but you said.  She doesn't get air time.  She doesn't get air time.  Why don't you go at it with her?  No, I'm not going to go at it with her.  She's a waste of time.  Don't you find, though, that being the one that people are saying that about is going  to make you the more famous of all of them?  I think that they need to, like, really watch their vocabulary and start, like, being 
[03:19:00]  big girls.  She doesn't like that word, so don't do this.  That's fair enough.  Don't use any like.  Yeah, but it's like a black thing.  It was another girl saying it, so that's okay.  That is true.  Right?  No, it's not.  Yeah, like, black guys are allowed to throw the N-word around.  White guy.  It's a horrible word to use.  It's a horrible word to use.  Hey, drug charges.  Do you talk about that?  Do I talk about it?  Sure.  26 years ago.  That's what I have to say.  It's 26 years ago.  Were you really caught with a kilo?  No, I was in the house with a lot of people.  A lot of people said a kilo. 
[03:19:30]  Well, if you split it up, it's not a kilo.  She flushed it down the toilet.  Yeah, right.  And we're going to find it.  Oh, so they raided a house and you were involved with that whole thing?  Exactly.  Period.  Are you lasered in this particular film?  Jimmy.  Because I have such a fetish for that.  I think it's the sexiest thing.  Look close.  Real close.  I can't see on the...  Look close.  Right there.  Real close.  Look right there, Jimmy.  It looks like you...  It's hard to see.  It looks like there's nothing there, though.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Same.  Is that a condom he has on? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo the condoms.  Yuck.  Boo.  Oh, let's talk about something.  You guys are gross, man.  No, we don't like condoms.  No, condoms are...  I'm very natural.  I'm a natural guy.  I don't like condoms.  Condoms.  Mmm.  Budinsky rubber.  A lot of phone calls coming in.  A lot of phone calls.  Yes, Anthony.  Yeah.  No, I'm just saying we're probably getting in trouble.  What happened?  Because she...  Why?  She's got to go.  She's got to go.  Oh, okay.  Where are you going now?  I have two more shows to do here, baby.  Really?  Yeah.  Ah, damn.  Could your lesbian lover come in and say hi? 
[03:20:30]  No.  He will not let her in.  No.  Why?  Is she pretty?  No.  No.  Well, look at the picture of her.  What picture?  I can't see.  It's a little teeny thing.  They can say hi to her after we're all done with this tour today.  We'll talk to her while you go somewhere else.  No, you won't.  All right.  Well, Real Housewives, Bravo.  Bravo.  Monday nights, 10 o'clock.  Monday nights, 10 o'clock.  And how do they get the CD?  Oh, you can go to...  You can actually...  You guys are special.  You get the CD.  Right now, that's the only way it's distributed.  Or you can go to iTunes and download all four versions of the remixes of Real Close. 
[03:21:00]  Real Close.  Including the Tortured Lullaby, which was seen first and heard first on Andy Cohen.  Watch what happens live on Monday nights.  And the book is called The Naked Truth.  It is.  The real story behind Daniel Straub and her own words.  Stop.  Stop.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  That's okay.  Just like Rusty Staub, baseball.  You've got to remember that.  You look very sexy in this photo.  Thank you.  You're wearing a little raincoat on the back and your leg...  And that's all I have on there, too.  Really?  Yeah.  Your little laser vagina is just...  Will that get you to read?  Will that get you to read it now?  I'm a very fast reader.  Okay, good.  Can you open your legs for us? 
[03:21:30]  That's just crap.  You're talking to him, right?  No.  I will if you will.  I mean, I'm a trooper.  Yeah, Jimmy will show you his ass.  No, I'm good.  You want to see Jimmy's ass?  No.  It's not bad.  It's a nicer ass than you're thinking it'd be.  It's pretty impressive.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's pretty impressive.  You don't even mind a little turd sticking out after a while.  Cigars and Scotch wants to know if you bleach your ass.  Oh, yeah.  Are we really asking this question?  Well, ass bleaching is...  He's an asshole, and...  Ass bleaching is...  He asks asshole questions. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, my God.  People kind of want to know what kind of...  So are we...  Am I going now?  Intimate primping people do.  Am I getting an apology from you?  Steve, please.  No, okay.  Why won't you apologize to her, you weirdo?  She's very nice.  I enjoyed her being on the show.  You look really bad, Steve.  It's all right.  I always look really bad.  Yeah, you kind of look like the bad guy in this.  Did you ever have nipple hair?  No, I don't, actually.  That's the worst.  Every once in a while.  Laser that off if you did, but she doesn't.  You come across one fucking nipple hair.  Yeah, one wily one.  Oh, my God.  It's disgusting. 
[03:22:30]  She's got to go.  I got to be...  I have two more shows.  I've really enjoyed it with you guys.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm going to step out of character.  I got to tell you something.  What?  I wanted to hate you so fucking bad today.  Aw.  And I think she's all right, man.  I'm going to hug it out with you in a second.  And I think that you get a bad rap on that fucking TV show now.  I totally changed my opinion of her.  Oh, my God.  You're still getting a hug.  You're getting a hug.  Just a hug.  My opinion was always very, let's see how it goes.  You're all getting a hug.  Okay, cool.  Except for...  No, man.  Except for her.  I don't touch people. 
[03:23:00]  Like, I think I watched the show to, like, not like you like everybody else.  And now I'm like, wow, she's getting a bad fucking rap.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Who do you hate the most on that show?  I don't hate any of them.  I just like all of them, though.  Dislike.  I will not be friends with any of them.  Right.  Even Kim G.  See, I know the show.  Who is that?  She was nobody.  She's not a housewife.  She's not contracted.  She's not on the housewives.  She was like a hanger-on.  All right, she's got to go.  She is such a stalker.  All right.  We'll be back.  She's a stalker. 
[03:23:30]  No, we won't.  Oh, we're not breaking?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, we'll be back.  Yes, we'll be back.  All right, bye.  The Obi and Anthony Show on the virus.  Virus.  Sirius XM.  We're looking at the sex tape now, now that she's gone. 
[03:24:00]  By the way, I was saying Danny should have played this when she was sitting here.  Of course.  I'd have to just watch her.  I just want to say really fast that, A, she was very cool, Daniel Staub.  Danielle Staub from Real Housewives of New Jersey.  And, I mean, we pushed her on it.  We went as far as we can with it.  She's making money off this sex tape.  I don't know how, but she's making money off this sex tape.  She has to be.  Maybe it's some kind of company that is set up that's not traced back to her or something. 
[03:24:30]  But I'm telling you, she's making money off this.  I just want to see her suck the cock.  He's wearing a bag, though.  It just wrecks everything.  Her tits look like someone laid her down at the 20-yard line and tried to do a field goal.  They're fucked up.  Yeah, but she got them fixed.  This is an old tape.  You can't get that fixed.  You saw.  I saw through clothes.  They look terrific.  You know what?  Yeah, they look terrific.  Do you see them in here?  They're frankentits.  No, stop it. 
[03:25:00]  They were nice.  No, they weren't.  In this video, they're not nice.  No, I know, but she had that fixed.  It was a whole episode.  Fixed through what?  More fucking incisions?  No, but they might have just given a little bit of a cut.  They're scarred up like crazy.  You can't have scarred up tits like that.  She's got a meaty pussy, right, Jimmy?  I can't really see it.  I've got to see it from the front.  Find me a meaty pussy.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is going on there?  What the hell is that?  She has a gorgeous pussy.  Oh, stop it, Jimmy.  Dude, it's fucking fat.  Look at the lips are really fat. 
[03:25:30]  What's that hanging out of it, though?  A tampon string, I think.  Is that a tampon string?  No.  It's a piercing.  Oh, it's a piercing.  I don't like that.  It's piercing or lint.  Can you move the fucking comforter, rookies?  She has a great pussy.  Look at the tits.  What are those?  Look at the ears.  They're not great.  What's going on there?  All right.  It shouldn't make you angry.  It's frightening.  Jesus Christ, this guy's packing, too.  And she said no.  No, she didn't want to talk about it.  She didn't want to talk about this at all.  But see, that keeps the interest going by not talking about it. 
[03:26:00]  That's what she was doing.  What's her implant?  A cinder block?  All right.  It just threw a fucking patio paver.  See, she's self-conscious about her big pussy.  That's why she's pierced.  She doesn't need to be.  Is that what happens?  Yeah, they always get self-conscious about a big clit or a big...  So they put stuff on it to kind of cover it because they're embarrassed by it.  That angle's not good for her.  That's great.  No angle is good for her.  Look at that.  Her fucking nice asshole and her giant fat lips.  She's fucking rules.  I'm talking about the boobs. 
[03:26:30]  They're sitting up really strange when she's on her side.  Really strange.  Look, I can't even deal with this.  What?  That the fucking...  What is that?  A C-section?  No.  What's going on down there?  There was something going on.  Where?  Let's see.  There's something going on everywhere.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Looks like she fell into a blender.  There's something going on.  There's a woman.  No, it's not.  That's fucking...  What?  Look at the...  What is that?  Dude, her breasts are a little bit of a mess, but when she's on her side and her asshole  sticking out, you wouldn't... 
[03:27:00]  Ving Rhames had a more attractive chest.  It looks like...  It does look like she has an extra rib or something, but besides that...  It's not fucking pussy.  It's all big.  It's great.  Get out of here.  Dude, man.  You put that in a white bikini and get it wet.  It's all bulging.  Stop it.  People would point.  Like, what's that?  Oh, Brendan...  It's like something they shot on Mythbusters.  Brendan from WhatWouldTylerDurtonDo.com, www.tdd.com is on the hotline.  Are we going to talk to him, or is he just giving us knowledge or what's going on?  I can't pick him up yet.  He's not on the hotline, so I can't. 
[03:27:30]  I don't know.  Let's try.  Okay.  Hey, Brendan.  Hey.  What's up, man?  By the way, thank you once again for all the support you give the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to acknowledge that.  And we push as many people as we can to www.tdd.com.  Great site.  Yeah, I'm extremely grateful.  I'm just a fan, man.  I listen to the show every day, so I might as well, you know, do something productive.  Now, do you need any of the footage we took today?  I don't know.  I don't know if we got to anything today.  No, I think I've been ripping most of it for the day, so I'll see if I can pull some from there. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, okay.  You were asking about whether or not Danielle was making any money off her sex tape.  Yeah.  And there's a law called 2257, so everyone, which means we said anyone who's in a porn has to sign some paperwork saying that this is who they are, that they're in the tape, and it's to verify their age.  Now, that might not apply to someone like Danielle.  Right.  Like, they have to verify that they're at least 18 years old when they're in the movie. 
[03:28:30]  Well, it's pretty obvious she's above it.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Verify her age.  I know, I know.  Jesus.  You remember the Vince Neil on the sex tape?  The what?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's Vince Neil, Janine, Linda Mulder, and the other girl was named Brandy Ledford, but her face was blurred over for the entire movie because she did not sign that paperwork.  So, if you can see Danielle in this movie, then at some point she signed some paperwork. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  She signed off of it at some point.  We try to push her, but it's obvious to me she's making money off this somehow.  Maybe not directly.  She's sibs.  Yeah, maybe there's some kind of company that was set.  I don't know how she's doing it, but she's making money off this tape.  She has a big clit, too, man.  She's great.  She hangs in the water when she takes a piss.  I know.  That's so great.  I know.  It looks like something hanging out of a lion's mouth.  I know.  She's great. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, so anytime you see a celebrity sex tape and they say they don't know about it, if you can see their face, at some point they sign some paperwork.  And if they didn't, then the company couldn't release the tape.  Oh, look at that.  Yeah.  They're fat.  Isn't it amazing?  Have a good morning.  All right, buddy.  Good job.  Thank you.  We're a little distracted.  She has a fat vagina, man.  It's amazing how one man's trash is truly another man's treasure.  I'm sitting here completely repulsed. 
[03:30:00]  I'm not.  And Jimmy is, like, digging on her clit.  Just her big clit.  Dude, I'm halfway repulsed.  Halfway repulsed?  Yeah, I'm okay with some of the shots, but when she's on all fours crawling across the floor, there's way too much shit happening back there.  There's too much shit happening everywhere.  Well, that's why I'm only halfway.  There's some angles that it looks all right.  Oh, God damn it.  Look at that fucking pussy, man.  How do you not like that?  Stop it.  Look at it.  That's how I don't like it.  It's wonderful. 
[03:30:30]  No, it's not.  There's a lot hanging out of there, Jimmy.  Exactly.  You're welcome.  I don't like this stupid piercing.  It's not piercing.  Is that a ligament or something?  That looks like the mouth of the hookworm we were looking at the other day.  Disgusting.  Yeah, I don't know, Jimmy.  Well, you guys, nerds to you.  I like it.  I just don't like the jewelry.  Get the jewelry out of here.  I don't need a distraction.  Jewelry?  Jewelry, yes.  Give me a jewelry.  Spare a swastika on her vag.  I think she's terrific.  Yeah, she was all right, though. 
[03:31:00]  She gave us good radio.  She's nice.  Her click grows when she lies.  See?  Because she was lying and she's got a big...  I'm yawning, but that was funny.  I was going to yawn when you said it.  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  Yeah, look at the time.  Let's get the plugs out.  Plugs.  No, because we always say that when it's just a tad early and there's nothing to plug. 
[03:31:30]  I'll start.  Yeah, let's get the plugs out.  I'll be making an appearance at my dad's gravesite today if you want to join me.  Oh, Jesus.  Six years ago today.  Bringing the show right back up there, aren't you?  Yeah.  Yep.  Mine won't be that interesting.  I might be doing a little housekeeping around the fucking tombstone today.  Oh, God.  Might lay down on the ground and have myself a good cry. 
[03:32:00]  Oh.  That's just sad.  That's kind of like what I'm going to do.  Hustle my girlfriend out so I can jerk off to this sex tape.  You got one?  No, I'm going to be sleeping on my way home, though.  It's just great.  I'll hit an apartment like I always do.  Hmm.  Yeah, this guy dated a girl with extra roast beef.  He loved it, too, Jimmy.  So you're not alone.  I like that, too, when it stinks a little. 
[03:32:30]  For real.  For real.  For real.  I was discussing with Jimmy in the bathroom.  I needed five more minutes, and Jimmy would have been smelling her armpits.  I know it.  I guarantee you.  And then we were going to work on the asshole.  But I was almost there.  I know I was.  She almost let me, but her armpits would have just smelled like the perfume she was wearing.  It wouldn't have mattered.  You have to have a chemistry for that to be sexy.  You have to.  Right.  If there's a girl who I'm not attracted to in that primal level, 
[03:33:00]  the underarm smell won't do anything for me.  Or it'll be like, yuck, like the way a lot of people react to it.  Like, I don't like it at all.  You like bad breath?  Never.  No.  Never.  No, that's a good one.  Never turns me on.  I mean, if you like smells, I mean, there you go.  I want the breath.  You don't mind a smelly armpit, but a bed.  You know what?  I think I'd rather smell bad pits than bad breath.  Ab, dude, I don't care if she fucking, if she takes,  if she takes a fucking three lager and then walks into the bedroom,  I'll eat her ass.  But bad breath is rough. 
[03:33:30]  It's terrible.  Yeah.  I don't care.  I'm still digging some fucking clams out of my teeth  from hanging out in Hoboken.  Linguinean clams.  That shit will stay with you for a week.  That's pretty.  Does that bother you?  It's pretty rank.  Yeah.  And my phlegm fucking smells bad or tastes bad or something.  Jesus Christ, man.  I'm still fucking spitting up phlegm.  And, man, you try to gulp that back down, man,  the smell that comes with that.  You might want to floss and then rinse. 
[03:34:00]  I've been flossing.  People are watching the tape and I'm not digging it.  Looks like she had a grenade exploded between her thighs.  Yes.  Jimmy should just take roast beef sandwich,  put it on the radiator for a day,  and then suck on it.  No, she has a big clit, man.  You guys are missing the big clit.  Yeah.  No, a clit should be of normal proportional size.  Oh, that's nice.  I like that.  No, it's not.  It is, too.  That looks like something I saw in fucking forensic files. 
[03:34:30]  I don't like the way she's holding it open, though,  so you don't have to make it look bigger.  Just leave it there, madam.  That's that bodybuilder.  I just saw that on Shark Week.  Jimmy, what is that girl saying right now  as she holds open her own hole?  Because it's really big.  What is she saying?  She's really saying this.  Huh?  What is stupid Hulk doing on TV?  He's, uh...  That might be old.  Is it really?  57 years.  His fucking room hair. 
[03:35:00]  Oh, God.  I feel bad for the Hulk.  Do ya?  Hell fucking yeah.  He doesn't have to be wrestling anymore.  He looks a little crazy.  He ran out of money, so now he's still doing it.  Oh, God.  Sucks.  That's like a pussy with an attachment.  Yeah.  I want a pussy that a girl's humiliated by.  Like, one that when she would change in high school,  she would put a twat in a locker  and hope none of the other girls called her  Big Pussy McGillicuddy.  Oh, fucking IED box.  That's just wrong, Jimmy. 
[03:35:30]  That doesn't look good at all.  Yeah, that doesn't do much.  That's just dangling.  That doesn't do much for me  unless it's really fat around the lips.  Like, this one girl who used to massage me,  her lips were giant,  and she had, like, a lot hanging down.  Like, that one would be great.  That just looks like a cluster of tumors.  Her pussy was long and fat.  Like, that one's nice.  No, it's not.  It is.  Look at that pretty blonde.  She's pointing at something.  Her vagina's going the other way.  It's 6 o'clock where her hand is,  5.30 where the pussy is.  You know, time zone jokes.  A little time zone humor.  You got your fans out there, though, Jimmy. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  A lot of fans of the big sloppy pussies.  They don't call me the meat pussy kid for nothing.  Just want to acknowledge you do got your fans out there.  By the way, meat pussy kid is replacing Kathy  in the fucking, uh, in the funny papers.  Oh, can't wait to see that.  That's just rough.  No, it's great.  Look at the little...  No.  It's like a...  You expect yellow jackets to fly out of that.  Yeah, it does.  It looks like a fucking beehive.  And she has, like, the little pink thong  wrapped around it  so the pussy can kind of hang out  like it's on a hammock.  Yeah.  It looks like a cigar that's falling apart.  It looks like the Kilroy was here.  They used to spray paint on the walls 
[03:36:30]  during the war.  Yeah, I don't like that.  It's all hairy.  I don't like when they stretch the lips.  Oh, what do you do with that?  What do you do?  I don't know what you do with that.  What is that?  Yeah, you have to look at it.  That's alien-like.  That looks like an asparagus.  Can you go back to that picture?  Can you turn it upside down?  Turn it upside down.  It looks like asparagus.  It looks like asparagus.  We're doing visual bits now.  Come on, that's funny, though, Ant.  It's...  I don't, um...  It looks like an asparagus, too. 
[03:37:00]  I don't find that attractive.  No.  To tell you the truth, I, uh...  All right, it's a side of the air.  It looks like asparagus.  Oh, my God.  Wow, it does.  Good call, dude.  That looks like asparagus.  How do we tweet that without getting in trouble?  You can't.  You can't.  What if I just do the tip?  Just call asparagus?  Yeah.  Let me try, Jimmy.  Look at the picture and then decide if I can tweet this.  I don't know what their TOS is.  What are you just going to get from the tip? 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  Danny, turn me in sideways here.  All right.  There's a guy sticking his tongue out from the side.  Could be anything.  Yeah, it does.  It's defying gravity.  Looks like a meat cactus.  Oh, yeah.  You can tweet that.  Yeah, probably.  No one would know what that is.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  I hope your whole account gets canceled.  How upset would you be?  Yeah, I'm sure.  It'll happen eventually.  It's taking a gamble.  Whatever.  Let's play What Is It? 
[03:38:00]  Well, everyone knows now.  Yeah.  Asparagus.  I'll figure something with this picture.  One of those.  How about one of those golden raisins?  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Maybe it's a golden parachute or something, you know.  That doesn't make sense, Chip.  It's a golden.  Oh, okay.  Now it does.  Yeah.  See you Monday.  That was fun. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, it was a good time.  Good week.  Yeah.  You want to play real close for everybody?  Yeah, on the way out.  Oh, no.  Why not?  She was nice.  Horrible.  Let's play the club version.  Yeah.  Word.  She said the club version's way better.  Oh, the club version?  The D-dance.  Is that the version where she's doing it and someone's clubbing her?  Because that might sound better.  Dude, I found a seven-minute version of the song.  Let's just kill these fuckers.  Oh, the poor listeners.  Fuck them.  Yep.  See you Monday. 
[03:39:00]  Nah, I can't do it.  Ah, I knew it.  All right.  We're done?  Lucky fucking listeners.  Yep.  Yeah, bud.  Done-ski, as they say.  Later.  Later.  Oh, what?  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Let it go.  Wait a minute.  Just let it go.  Wait a minute.  Don't leave yet.  Wait, wait.  You know why?  What?  What?
