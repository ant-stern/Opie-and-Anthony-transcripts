<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion on grammar, specifically the preferred usage of "me and Anthony" versus "Anthony and I," with the hosts favoring the former.  This segued into listener reactions to Opie's beard, prompting humorous comments from Opie about his lack of interest in male admirers.  Anthony's Shorty Award nomination was then discussed, focusing on his competitive spirit and a critique of other nominees, including Zack Ryder, and their web shows.  A significant portion of the show involved a bet Opie made with Kris Jenner about Khloe Kardashian's paternity, suggesting O.J. Simpson as a possibility, based on perceived physical similarities between Khloe and Sidney Simpson. The hosts debated the likelihood of Jenner accepting the bet.  Mark Wahlberg's controversial comments about potentially preventing 9/11 were analyzed, alongside the public backlash and his apology, with the hosts questioning the intensity of the reaction.  The show also touched upon the "shock jock" label,  past interactions with Bubba the Love Sponge, and upcoming guests Tom Papa and Jerry Springer.  The Republican presidential primaries, particularly Newt Gingrich, and *Jersey Shore*, including Vinny's departure and Snooki's behavior, were also discussed. The pre-Tom Papa segment ended with a humorous recounting of Tom Papa's frustrating experience with the show's security and scheduling.


Tom Papa, a guest in studio, dominated a large segment, detailing his numerous grievances with a staff member, Roland.  These included being uninvited from a show after Patrice O’Neal’s stroke, exclusion from Roland's pizza parties, and consistent omission from guest lists due to purported technical issues.  Papa expressed considerable anger, using strong language. The conversation also covered the Italian cruise ship captain who abandoned his ship, with speculation on human behavior in crisis situations contrasting the captain's actions with those of firemen and military personnel.  The discussion included humorous anecdotes, such as Mark Wahlberg's boastful comments about piloting planes, and clips of past confrontations between Roland and former employees like Master Poe were referenced.  The segment concluded with Tom Papa promoting his comedy special and the hosts mocking Roland.


Jerry Springer joined the broadcast unexpectedly.  The conversation began with jokes about Osama bin Laden’s death, Jerry Springer's hair, and the upcoming appearance of Vinny from *Jersey Shore*. A running gag involving the phrase "if you want to" referenced Tom Papa, who was again promoted for his shows and podcast. Vinny’s delayed arrival due to parking issues led to extended banter about Vinny, *Jersey Shore*, and political figures like Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich.  A lengthy discussion with Tom Papa about a conflict with Roland over a laminate pass ensued.  Vinny finally arrived, discussing his anxiety, experiences on *Jersey Shore*, relationships with other cast members (especially “The Situation”), and his upcoming book, "Control the Crazy."  He also promoted his book.  A female station employee expressed admiration for Vinny.  More jokes and promotions followed.


A female guest, Angie (guessed to be from El Salvador), joined the show, leading to banter about her dating life, her four-year boyfriend drought, and her views on men, including a discussion of “DTF.”  Vinny interacted with Angie, with the hosts commenting on their apparent attraction.  Vinny’s anxiety and book were again discussed.  The presidential election and various candidates were debated. DJ Who Kid joined the broadcast, continuing the conversation with Angie, including discussion of her Twitter handle (@DJ Ang 3) and Vinny's perceived cockiness.  Sexually suggestive humor continued.  Brian Fenkart called in to promote his album, "Simple and Gray," discussing his career, Broadway experience, and views on music piracy.  The hosts mentioned Ron Bennington and Mick Foley’s potential appearances. The show concluded with chatter about Angie, the hosts' physical attributes, and planned future segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Good morning!  I'm very excited, Anthony.  Why?  We are 24 hours away from the great Ron Bennington.  Oh, right!  Walking in this studio and doing a little radio with you and I.  Or is it me and you?  Are you a you and I guy or a me and you guy?  People on the Twitter get very upset when I say, like, me and Opie.  And then I write whatever, you know, which I think is probably pertinent to something. 
[00:00:30]  Or people, you know, interesting, whatever.  And then they just blow off every bit of the content of what I wrote and say,  It's Opie and Opie!  It's Opie and Opie!  Was that the point I was trying to get across?  I'm a me and Anthony guy.  That's what I am.  And I don't care what the old dudes, you know, came up with.  Yeah, fuck that.  Nowadays, it's completely acceptable to say me and whoever.  Oh, I'm being corrected.  No, Ant, it's Opie's eye.  Opie's eye. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  See that?  Thanks for the plug.  See what happened?  Thank you.  Thank you.  See what happened there?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, I don't care about that old English shit.  The rules they put in place in the ye old days.  Oh, yeah.  I don't like that.  Some of this shit is what it is.  It's now me and Anthony.  It's me and whatever.  Yeah, why is it take this archaic English?  We're not talking like Shakespeare these days.  So why can't we just change a few things and say it just sounds better and it's easier  to say me and Opie do a show here.  Yeah, if the blacks could add the word though at the end of every tweet, I certainly could 
[00:01:30]  say me and Anthony.  And they're talking in some kind of code on Twitter.  Well.  I don't know what that's all about.  Well, it's a phenomenon, though.  They really like though at the end of every tweet.  They could literally fit in.  Put though in your Twitter and you'll enjoy a lot of tweets.  They could fit in War and Peace in 140 characters.  Ooh, book radio.  They are, again.  Book radio.  Let's start with a little book radio.  I got a tweet yesterday. 
[00:02:00]  A guy goes, now that you're heavily involved in book radio, could you tell them to go back  a few pages?  I fell asleep during the reading yesterday.  That's good.  Sometimes you have to recap.  Yeah.  You know, you got to maybe backsell a chapter.  Yeah.  Book radio, my egg.  Speaking of the Twitter, you brought it up because they're correcting you.  I just want to make an announcement.  Yeah.  I appreciate all the guys that are very concerned that I'm growing a beard and I might not be  fuckable anymore to you. 
[00:02:30]  Isn't that just another amazing phenomenon?  Right.  They're all bummed out.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  That beard's got to go, man.  Yeah.  Hey, man.  Hey, you look older with the beard.  Dude.  Hey, man.  You know, if you think that beard is doing you any favors.  Hey, man.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking, holy fuck.  I think there's a lot of guys out there that want to fuck me.  Yeah.  Guess what?  I don't want to fuck guys. 
[00:03:00]  Hey, queers.  Right.  Why don't you fucking not worry so much about what we look like?  I get that all the time.  I get creeped out by that.  If you're trying to slam us, whatever.  But I don't see it.  I see a bunch of guys that really, really are attracted to us for some reason.  And if you change your appearance with growing a little facial hair or maybe you got a new  shirt or maybe you add a couple holiday pounds on, these guys get really bummed out.  Very rarely do you hear from girls that say anything about that. 
[00:03:30]  They're just cool.  They tweet whatever.  And if a girl says it, I'm like, ah, fuck really.  Yeah, that's like, ah, well, whatever.  Because I want to look presentable to the female race, certainly.  Block, block.  No, I don't even block them.  I feel bad for them.  And then one guy goes, hey, I don't care what the haters say.  Your beard is epic.  And I wrote that guy back, haters.  Isn't that like so 2010?  Oh.  Who the fuck deals with haters now?  You spell it an eight.  Oh, you do?  And then it's okay. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, of course.  That's like what the new things that the kids are doing.  If anybody ever writes that, I'm just like, what?  What?  Really?  I don't think anyone's dealing with haters anymore.  You used to because it was such a thing to really put yourself out there in this social  networking.  So you try to explain and you try to maybe discuss and fight with these idiots.  And then you realize, nah, you just block them and move on because there's plenty of people  that enjoy what you do.  I'm not a hater. 
[00:04:30]  That's what it comes down to.  I'm a participator.  Nice.  I like that.  That's what I say.  Just wrote that.  So I want to thank all the guys that are very concerned about my appearance.  Wow.  You know, but you might want to tone it down a little bit.  Your flames are starting to show.  Your flames.  Your fucking flames.  And we don't mind the gays, okay?  I love the gay.  We don't mind the gays.  Who doesn't love the gay?  I should have had some of these tweets prepared because they're creepy, man.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Just creepy.  Are there comments on the picture maybe that you can read, Sam?  Yes.  Because I should have collected these tweets because they were coming in all day.  People were like, fuck, man.  The beard.  Why?  Why would you do that to your face?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Dude.  The brawny fucking Photoshop, by the way, made me laugh really hard.  Oh, they Photoshopped it.  Fuck you, asshole.  In a brawny, it looks like your favorite towel.  That's great.  That was fucking funny.  I like the fact that you can look at that Photoshop and go, what did they Photoshopped? 
[00:05:30]  They just took a picture of the brawny fucking paper towel.  And then someone's calling me out because I'm not holding Gina Carano lovingly.  I don't know her.  So we have our arms around each other.  So I'm like, I do this sort of arm around her.  But I'm trying to be respectful.  It's an awkward thing when you take pictures sometimes to put your arm around people.  Most of the time, I've said it before, I don't even touch the person.  I put my arm behind them and just kind of suspend it in midair.  And when the picture's taken, because it's two-dimensional, you don't notice that I'm 
[00:06:00]  not even fucking, I don't have my arm, I'm not even touching the person.  Ah, whatever.  A little inside tidbit for you there.  Yeah, of course.  By the way, speaking of Twitter, I want to thank everybody.  Tweety, tweety, tweety, tweet.  They are just amazing.  Are they?  Let me tell you.  Because, Opie, as you know, I was nominated for a Shorty Award.  You're obsessing about the Shorty Award.  Why?  Because I never do these things.  And I want to be number one. 
[00:06:30]  You do?  Just think of what the acceptance speech could be.  Wait, you might win, you think?  I don't know.  I think I'm nominated.  And then they've got to take the top six people in the category.  And then they judge it.  Oh, really?  They're a little thing.  But you've got to keep your nominations up.  But, see, I don't even care about winning.  I want to be number one in the category.  And right now, number four.  And I'm almost ready to take over the third spot.  Damn.  And then I take on Red Band.  That's going to be a tough one. 
[00:07:00]  That's a tough one.  That's Joe Rogan's guy.  Yeah, it steps up really quick, like big after that.  And then the top one, Zack Ryder.  You can't beat him.  Two Long Island guys duking it out for the web show shorty category lead.  Wow.  How huge is that?  You're in fourth?  Fourth place right now for the shorty award.  In what?  Web show?  In web show, yes.  Let's see how well I'm doing.  Because I'm in the YouTube star category. 
[00:07:30]  YouTube star.  That one seems like a tough one because everyone.  I'm not doing as well, Santon.  Everyone's a YouTube star.  It's crazy.  Come on.  Am I on the front page?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  That's not good.  20th.  Okay.  We don't have to look any further.  Oh, Zack.  Zack's 19th.  Holy shit.  Let's not embarrass me in front of everybody.  21.  All right.  There you go.  You're 21st.  Well, all right.  Well.  You've got a few leaps and bounds.  Once you hit that top five, it starts getting a little difficult.  You've got to keep your votes up.  I hope by today, I hope the people, the listeners help out. 
[00:08:00]  And by today, I can take over the top spot from Mr. Fucking Long Island, WWE.  But you've got a huge, successful radio show that's way bigger than a dumb shorty award.  What are you doing?  Don't give a shit.  I know.  It's kind of weird, isn't it?  They're so into our side projects.  Just want to get to number one on this and feel like, ah.  We like our side projects because we feel like individuals. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  And it feels like total freedom.  I like feeling like an individual, as well as part of this massively successful radio show.  Exactly.  Hey, can I get in another category?  I might have picked the wrong category, Sam.  What category?  Huh?  In the shorties.  This motherfucker.  That's his show?  It's the best.  Do you know I have hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in my program?  It is.  In my program.  In my program.  In my program.  You can be a billionaire.  I'm not a billionaire, though.  Oh.  By the way, I am.  I will be making a video. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  You can make videos and post them and have them classified as an editorial video.  You're making a video to try to promote the fact that you want to be number one.  Why are we in the radio category, you idiot?  Fuck the radio category.  Who's in the radio category?  Because we're huge here.  In radio.  See, I don't care about being number one in radio on the Shorty Award.  We've already been successful in radio, so we don't need to go in this category.  Yeah, so who needs that?  Wow, who are these dopes?  Exactly.  Who are these dopes?  I don't know one of them.  I like Covino and Rich.  Like I said, who are these dopes? 
[00:09:30]  Jesus.  I like the Covino and Rich.  Covino and Rich are fifth.  Yeah, I like those guys.  I can't.  I got to start openly admitting the shows are like...  No, I just want Webb's show.  I like Covino and Rich.  Oh, God.  What is this now?  That's his show.  He's...  Fucking...  Zack Ryder stands in front of a wall with his wrestling belt and just pontificates?  He's not even...  Happy New Year, broskies, and welcome to episode 47 of Z, True Long Island Story. 
[00:10:00]  I am...  You're promoting him now.  Don't do this.  I know.  Don't do this.  I understand.  Don't play his shit.  You're right.  Don't play his shit.  Sam Roberts was because he's a wrestling geek.  But no, there's no quality in here.  Yeah.  There's no quality programming.  All right.  Well...  I'm not going to deal with that.  Just me, web show, Anthony Cumia, Twitter, Shorty Awards.  Yes.  Very good.  Um, I guess Khloe Kardashian is OJ's daughter. 
[00:10:30]  Now that's...  You know, I understand she might not be Robert Kardashian's daughter, but to go that extra  leap and say OJ's daughter, I'm not feeling it.  Well, did you see the side-by-side comparison with Sidney Simpson?  OJ's daughter-daughter?  No.  Mm-hmm.  No.  You mean that little kid?  Yeah, look.  Look how they inquire, national inquire.  Oh, boy.  Obviously, this story's ridiculous.  But who knows?  Who knows in those circles? 
[00:11:00]  If OJ fucked Robert Kardashian's wife, that's epic.  But they got a side-by-side with Khloe and Sidney, and there's absolutely a similarity there.  Yeah?  Yes.  There is, yeah.  Wouldn't Khloe be darker, though?  I would think so.  I'm not...  Because Sidney, whose mom was most likely killed by OJ, she was very white, and she's darker  than Khloe, so that's why that whole thing is kind of silly.  I'm not seeing any OJ in her face, though. 
[00:11:30]  I see OJ in OJ's daughter's face.  Yeah.  I don't see the OJ face, though, really, in Khloe.  Oh, by the way, I've had real discussions with our agent.  What?  About this bet that I threw out there that everyone picked up on.  Oh, boy.  I've had some real discussions.  What did Bob say?  Paperwork is being written up.  Oh, God.  Just in case Kris Jenner goes for it.  Yeah?  So far, what?  Nothing?  From her camp?  There's no way. 
[00:12:00]  What?  No way.  There's no way she's going to fucking bite on this one.  Well, she has the advantage.  Yeah.  If she doesn't bite...  Let me tell you this right now.  The bet was for a quarter million dollars to Kris Jenner, specifically, to prove that  Khloe Kardashian, her father is Rob Kardashian, right?  Right.  She could, like, do the test secretly, know how it's going to come out, and then take  the bet.  Oh, oh, right, right.  So if she doesn't take the bet, that means we all know what we're thinking. 
[00:12:30]  See, I think she's pretty wealthy, right?  It was for charity, though.  Who doesn't like charity?  But I don't think she wants to promote a shock jock-ish radio show.  It's not shock jock-ish if it's for charity.  Well, I understand, but, you know, our reputation precedes us.  I don't think she'd want to promote shock jockery for a quarter mil, even for charity.  We're not shock jocks anymore.  We have proven to the people we're more than that. 
[00:13:00]  Yes.  Shock jocks have gone away.  Yeah, the shock jock label is crazy.  They've gone away.  Name one.  It's like saying a band is grunge.  Right.  It's stupid.  It doesn't fit.  Right.  Anymore.  Name one.  Who's shock jocking out there?  Who's shock jocking?  Sam Roberts, you're big in the radio biz.  You know the comings and goings of radio people.  Who's the shock jock?  I think you could make an argument that Bubba the Love Sponge is still doing a little shock  jockery stuff. 
[00:13:30]  Shock jock-ish?  Is he internet radio?  Is he internet radio?  He's in Florida on real radio stations.  And internet radio?  Internet radio, too.  E-yada?  Yeah, I think there is a shock jock show on book radio.  I haven't gotten an email from Bubba lately.  He reached out.  Brother.  What?  Did he?  Brother.  Did he really?  We got to get together.  Unite?  Brother, we got to unite.  What was that?  I wrote him back. 
[00:14:00]  I go, hey, I thought you were supposed to punch me in the face.  And then I never heard from him again.  I'm laughing.  People can't read me.  I love it.  I love they can't read me.  Brother.  Brother.  I know what's going on with you guys over there at SiriusXM.  Yeah, we still have a contract and we still get paid.  We must unite, brother.  Not like you.  Remember when you were saying how we were getting fired every month?  Right.  I go, hey, that's good and all, but I thought you were supposed to punch me in the face.  Yeah, what happened?  And I didn't get the follow-up email. 
[00:14:30]  Oh, brother.  Brother.  I would assume we would have said something like, you know, that's just radio stuff.  You know, we all do it.  It's Bubba Ferrena Center, brother.  Isn't he pals with him?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Are you jealous?  Iraq must really be jealous.  Iraq's a little jealous.  Yeah.  But let him be known.  I don't have a problem with Bubba.  Iraq's also jealous.  I've never even met the fucking guy.  Once people get beaten down by a fucking radio company, you got to have a little fucking,  you know, sympathy and camaraderie. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  I could give a shit.  I'm not going to say hi and be nice, but I'm sure I'm not going to be mean either.  I don't give a shit.  Bubba's army, though, man, they were tough to take on.  Holy fuck, man.  I couldn't sleep at night.  Fucking deflecting Bubba army tweets left and right.  We had more shit come our way from, like, some of these no market assholes that used  to try to bash us.  And that was nothing.  I'm trying to think who came close to even taking us down. 
[00:15:30]  And I can't even think of one.  Book radio.  One fucking show.  Although book radio is going to be a tough one.  Book radio.  Anyway, so I got, he wants to be, I don't know.  Yeah, just go there.  A Shorty Award winner.  Shorty Award.  It's a shorty award, shorty awards dot com slash Anthony Cumia.  Right.  And that'll hook you up with the little vote thing.  And then when you vote, you got to put in a reason at the end or else they don't count  the vote.  Yeah, I know.  So you got to do that. 
[00:16:00]  And I don't care what you put in.  Oh, that means, that's probably what happened with me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we got that bet floating around out there.  Right.  The fucking L.A. Times and Cleveland picked it up.  So that's good.  Oh, nice.  And Perth.  Perth.  So?  Perth picked it up.  You know where Perth is?  Perth.  Perth.  Perth.  Australia.  Oh, there you go.  They're all about it.  And then some fucking foreign language paper where you can only recognize our names.  Your names.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you, did you, were you this guy? 
[00:16:30]  Um, Bob.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've really got to write something up, Bob.  No, I was, I was talking about tax write-offs and all sorts of shit.  Oh, there you go.  Fuck, I'm brave.  I'm brave to fucking put this out there.  Yeah.  This fucking Khloe Kardashian is, is a monster compared to all the other daughters that, that  Kris Jenner has had.  Yeah.  Come on.  How about some DNA?  And they're correcting our audio.  I do know that the two younger daughters are with, uh, Bruce Jenner. 
[00:17:00]  I do know that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I am talking about the older, uh, three daughters, which would be Kourtney, Kim, and Khloe.  Right.  And Khloe is a monster compared to the other two.  Yeah, she is huge.  And you know what?  Huge.  In her favor, too, I'll tell you this much, fucking Khloe has a great personality, too,  compared to the other two sisters.  The other two sisters, Kim and Kourtney, are fucking duds.  They're boring as hell.  They have no personalities whatsoever. 
[00:17:30]  And Khloe definitely has a huge personality, which makes it suspicious, too.  So, here's the, um, actually, yeah, it's Kim and who's the other one?  Khloe?  Kourtney.  Kourtney.  Sorry, Kourtney.  Kourtney's never happy.  She just sits there.  Here's Kourtney talking.  I don't know what everybody is doing here.  It's like she's a ventriloquist.  Her mouth barely moves, and there's no emotion.  In her eyes, nothing.  She's straight, like Bell's palsy.  She sits there.  She sucks. 
[00:18:00]  I think, you know, who's her boyfriend?  Rick, is it?  What's his name?  Kourtney.  I don't even fucking know.  That drunk guy.  I don't know.  The drunk guy that she had a kid with.  I love that you're finally watching, uh.  Scott.  Yeah, Scott.  The Kardashians.  Because I, I want to.  Scott went up to Toronto with Hump, and I don't know what to do.  Didn't you tell me he was going on?  I don't think that's very similar.  Oh, this monotone, just shit.  Right.  And Kim Kardashian's not much better.  All she does is just blink, blink, blink. 
[00:18:30]  You think I'm hot?  Blink, blink, blink.  You think I'm hot?  Blink, blink, blink.  You think I'm hot?  I like the fact that they get up, though, and there's no makeup on their faces, and  you look like, wow.  That, they should fucking give their makeup artists a lot of cake, a lot of cash.  And then Khloe's over the top in her personality.  Yeah.  That's suspicious, too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Different personality.  So.  She's a monster.  She's got big feet.  I think officially Kris Jenner owes me $250,000 that I get to give to my favorite charity, which 
[00:19:00]  is me.  You.  Yes, me.  I'm a charity case.  What?  I'm a charity case.  Why?  Get the word out.  I think she owes me the $250,000 at this point.  All right.  Yeah, she got paid up.  I can't wait forever.  There's got to be a time limit on this shit.  I don't think she's got to pay if she has it wrong.  My charity is the Hughes's.  The Human Fund.  What, the Hughes's?  The Hughes's.  Oh.  So.  I've never heard of that charity.  So Mr. Greg Hughes doesn't have to write any more checks anymore. 
[00:19:30]  I could use my charity, the Hughes Charity, to take care of them.  That comes in handy, that the charity is the same name as you.  The Hughes's.  Yeah.  The Hughes Fund.  Yeah.  Hughes Fund, Inc.  I think you have to have ink.  Yeah, you might as well.  Dot org.  Making an org.  I just love they have to deal with this bet, because it really is being picked up by a  lot of places.  Yeah, yeah.  People are.  They have to deal with.  They're running with it.  Or shenanigans. 
[00:20:00]  They are running with it.  Anyway.  You know, Mark Wahlberg.  Yes.  You know, I was outraged like everyone else when I heard about Mark Wahlberg.  And then I read, I read into this damn thing, and I don't have a problem with what he said.  We look like assholes right now, man.  Well, maybe not.  What does the covers of the paper say?  The cover of the paper says 9-11 jerk, who I think would more aptly be Muhammad Atta. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  Outrage over stars, sick plane boast.  Right.  And let's roll.  Right.  Actors insult, boast about 9-11 hygiene.  Did you know he was supposed to be on one of those planes?  I guess the one leaving Boston?  Fucking A.  Opie, did you listen to 1010 Winds this morning?  I sure did.  But I didn't know he was supposed to be on the plane until today. 
[00:21:00]  I knew about Seth MacFarlane.  I thought that would have came out already.  Seth MacFarlane.  Right.  But I did not know about Mark E. Mark.  Right.  And he's basically saying, look, I'm a family man.  If I'm on this plane with kids, that plane's not going down.  And I think every guy would say that.  Hello, exactly!  Yes!  There's some insensitivity there, obviously.  I'm not stupid.  I know that.  Oh, fuck, it's idiot.  Yes.  You know, it's very insensitive to say something like that, but he was just speaking in his 
[00:21:30]  mind like, holy shit, I was almost on that plane, and he's putting himself in that position  like, there's no fucking way I'm going to allow that plane to go down with me and my  kids on the plane.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm sure there were people on the plane that were thinking that exact thing, and  they probably couldn't get the job done for whatever reason, because I don't know what  the reasons are, because I wasn't on the plane.  Look, it seemed like it was a tough situation.  The hind-sightedness of this whole thing is ridiculous, because...  That's what gets people, you think?  No one knew the plane was going to crash until it crashed. 
[00:22:00]  You know, up till then, hijackings had happened, and they usually land somewhere, and the rule  of thumb was, you sit there with your mouth shut and hope for the best when they get on  the ground.  Right.  The plane that crashed into Pennsylvania was directly because of the passengers' intervention,  because they knew that the other planes were being flown into things.  Yeah.  So they got the word, like, we're not going to land, so let's get up and do something,  and they did.  For Mark Wahlberg to say that he would have done something, not knowing that this was 
[00:22:30]  a death ride, is just silly.  It's hindsight.  It's dumb.  Everybody who knows what happened on the plane...  Right.  ...is not going to sit there and not do anything, knowing that it's going to fly into the trade  center.  You're going to all get up and fucking try to do something.  So do you think it was dumb what he said?  Yeah, it's a dumb thing to say because...  Do you understand why he said it, though?  It's impossible to have any kind of insight into what you would do, knowing what the end 
[00:23:00]  result is now.  I don't think he was trying to hurt anyone by saying this.  No, I don't think so either.  He's just...  The problem is...  He's been in here.  He seems cool.  Most of the media outlets will just spin this like, oh, what a jerk.  Mark, and I just see it as a guy just saying what a guy would say, like, yeah, fuck, if  I'm on that plane, no way is that going down.  I can't imagine.  Hello, exactly!  Exactly, Mark.  But...  Mr. Wahlberg.  But obviously very insensitive for the people that lost loved ones on the plane.  Obviously.  Is it, though?  Is it saying... 
[00:23:30]  Is he demeaning them saying that...  It's insensitive.  ...I would have done something even if these people decided to just sit around and do nothing?  I don't think he was saying that.  It's insensitive for the people that lost loved ones.  Yeah.  I don't think Mark Wahlberg was trying to be insensitive.  I don't either.  Okay.  I don't neither.  But it's a silly remark because you can't judge what you do based on what you know now.  Yeah.  Why was it...  Silly.  Why did he say this?  He's an idiot.  He needs publicity for contraband. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, fuck, it's an idiot.  How's contraband doing?  Is it doing all right?  Yeah.  It looks pretty action-packed.  I gotta say.  Doesn't it?  Yeah.  Here's how it went down.  Tonight, Boston native and Hollywood star Mark Wahlberg is apologizing for comments some  people are calling distasteful and disrespectful.  The actor claimed in a recent interview that he could have stopped 9-11.  And as Jim Smith explains, those comments stunned people whose loved ones were killed  in the attacks.  I'm coming for you. 
[00:24:30]  By professional standards, Mark Wahlberg is on a roll, starring in the smash hit new film,  Contraband.  But he's hit a major PR pothole.  Wahlberg was supposed to be on one of the planes that hit the Twin Towers, but changed  his travel plans days earlier.  And now, in an interview with Men's Journal magazine, he says, if I was on the plane with  my kids, it wouldn't have went down like it did.  There would have been a lot of blood in that first-class cabin, and then me saying, okay,  we're going to land somewhere safely. 
[00:25:00]  Don't worry.  Well, that's like a script to a horrible movie.  Oh, he wants to be an action hero.  Did he say that?  All right.  I'm covered in blood.  We're going to land, motherfuckers!  Man, you can't say anything without everyone picking it apart, though.  Well, yeah.  You know, he was just saying what every guy would say.  That's very good.  What?  Sounds like a Jimmy Norton script.  Yeah, yeah.  One of Jimmy's action movie scripts. 
[00:25:30]  Turk February.  Turk February.  He gets on the plane, and he cuts all the terrorists up.  He's drenched in blood.  Yeah.  And then he says, don't worry, people.  We're going to land this plane safely.  And he's a rogue.  He was a rogue cop.  That's retarded.  You're going to get all these celebrities basically saying absolutely nothing eventually.  Yeah.  You know?  Because they're making a huge deal about this.  It's on the front page of our papers.  I'm sure it's on the front page of the Boston Papers today.  I'm sure it's front page of the L.A. papers today. 
[00:26:00]  Is this really something, though, that's going to make it like Twitter and the fact that YouTube picks up on things and the press puts so much shit out there and people pick it up and trade it.  Is that making things worse for celebrities or better?  Because it's almost desensitizing people to what celebrities say these days.  It used to be a celebrity every once in a while would trip over their fucking tongue, say something dumb, and get in trouble for it.  Now it happens so often you can't even keep track of all these people.  So I think some are slipping through the cracks. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, I agree.  I think as we go forward with social networking, because I don't know if it's going to be Twitter.  I can just say Twitter.  Whatever it becomes, I think this type of thing won't matter as much.  Yeah, it won't even matter.  But right now it really does because we're in the early stages of celebrities talking and tweeting like they are.  This is like someone on television in the early, like the 50s, saying pregnant or bathroom.  Right.  Remember that would freak people out?  Right.  Like you weren't able to say it. 
[00:27:00]  I think the famous story is Jack Parr on The Tonight Show, before Johnny Carson did The Tonight Show, said water closet.  Actually just said water closet, which is the oldie time term for bathroom.  Why did they come up with that?  I understand, you know, they were trying to class it up, the fact that people were dropping deuces.  I guess because there wasn't a bath in there at that point.  It was just a turlet, and they couldn't say crapper.  I don't know.  Yeah, but the guy who invented it, his name was Tom Crapper, right? 
[00:27:30]  Could we have a word origin for water closet, please?  Word origin, water closet.  Go to Wikipedia.  It's up, right?  Is it up today?  Of course it is.  That was just a one-day thing?  One day.  That's all they care about.  Way to commit.  Yeah, really.  Really making a stand.  I think the Sopa thing is still kind of happening.  Yeah.  Way to commit.  One day.  Yeah, so he said water closet.  And they almost threw him off the fucking air.  It was crazy. 
[00:28:00]  You couldn't say anything.  Lucy and Desi couldn't sleep in the same bed.  When Lucy was literally pregnant with a child, they wrote it into the TV show, but never  said the word pregnant.  Right.  Because you weren't allowed to back then.  And now we've moved.  Yeah, now we're saying all kinds of shit on television.  But I think it's the same thing with social media.  Look, the Mark Wahlberg, you know, look, he said something that's insensitive to people.  Yes.  Okay.  But all the attention he's going to get today?  Yeah.  And the front page of papers?  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Really?  There's some real shit going on out there.  Yeah.  Here's more of the Mark Wahlberg thing.  Don't worry.  Those who lost loved ones on September 11th were shocked, one of them calling the statement  silly, grandstanding, disrespectful.  Outside a Cambridge theater where Wahlberg's movie is playing, his fans quick to react.  I think it's really insensitive for him to say something like that.  After watching several of his films, namely Fighter, I feel like he probably would have  done something. 
[00:29:00]  If he had said that about, and my family was affected, I'm sure I would have been a lot  more offended.  Mark Wahlberg's comments touched off a firestorm of criticism.  And it didn't take him long to issue an apology.  Wahlberg said, to suggest I would have done anything different on that plane was irresponsible.  I deeply apologized to the families of victims that my answer came off as insensitive.  It was certainly not my intention.  If you say something dumb, then the best you can do is just apologize.  And so he did that.  Mark Wahlberg is certainly hoping that saying he's sorry will heal any unintended wounds. 
[00:29:30]  We should point out, it's not the first time that Mark Wahlberg has talked publicly  about the attacks of 9-11.  And back in 2006, he said he would have tried to do something if he'd been on board.  And he said that he's had dozens of dreams about it.  Yeah.  I mean, he's really close to the situation.  Yeah, you got it.  Because he was almost on that plane.  So that's got to keep him up at night.  Like, holy fuck, if I didn't decide to go to that film festival, because I listen to  1010 Winds, I would have been on that plane.  So then you're thinking, well, fuck, I'm on that plane.  That thing ain't going down. 
[00:30:00]  Because you don't want to think that your life's going to end.  Dude, that would haunt you a little bit.  I think people got to put that into some fucking consideration.  Because that guy can picture himself being on that plane a lot more than we can.  Right.  Because it was just a change of fucking plans that kept him from really being there.  Right.  You could imagine what it would be like, but him, it's like, wow, I would have been on  there.  Right.  And maybe you get carried away thinking about it and think, you know, well, I might have 
[00:30:30]  been doing, I might have done something.  I might have saved all those people.  Maybe there's a guilt thing, too, you know?  Right.  You think, like, I lived, maybe if I was on there, I could have done something.  Maybe he feels like, yeah, I would have done something that might have made the outcome  different.  Yeah.  That's kind of crazy.  How do you bash him like that?  Nah.  That's silly.  I think he'll be all right.  He apologized quickly and he probably met the apology.  Yeah.  He probably realized, oh, fuck.  All right.  Maybe that wasn't the smartest thing to say.  Because most of these apologies, like we say, like we say, you can't believe. 
[00:31:00]  But I think this one might be a real apology.  I cut him some slack.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The whole thing got blown out of proportion.  It is true.  I got blown out of proportion.  Right?  Exactly.  Hello.  Exactly.  Hello.  Exactly.  Hello.  Exactly.  You got your food yet?  No.  I don't know.  I'm talking for an early break today.  I got my meal.  I'm starving Marvin. 
[00:31:30]  I'll tell you this much.  Tom Papa will be in studio today.  Oh, I think we got to cancel.  And we did him a favor yesterday.  Because he would have sat there.  Oh, I know.  Because Jim Brewer tells his stories and you got to just fucking sit back in your chair and  listen.  His stories yesterday were great.  Brewer was fucking great.  Tom Papa will be in studio hopefully in the next 15 minutes.  We got Jerry Springer coming in today.  Right.  You got to go at it with this guy.  You know what?  I don't have the fucking energy to go at it with Springer because he is so just adamant. 
[00:32:00]  So are you.  Yeah.  But if you remember.  You guys are complete opposites.  Let's do this.  Now, if you remember a lot of times when Patrice was in here, me and him would have these discussions  and a lot of times I'd be like, you know, you make a point.  I got you on that one.  But like Springer's just so he's so pro fucking Obama and just and so liberal and fucking guilty  white man.  Speaking of which, here comes Newt. 
[00:32:30]  Here comes Newt.  Newt.  He's not going away.  And what?  No, he wants us.  He's only 10 points behind Mitt right now in South Carolina.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The South Carolina.  And the gap is closing.  Yeah.  And but I guess Newt's wife came out, ex-wife came out and said some nasty things about him  and how he isn't he shouldn't be president.  Oh, how much money qualified?  How much money did she get for that?  Exactly.  All I could think is what ex-wife is going to say anything nice about their ex, especially 
[00:33:00]  if it didn't go well.  I'm sure he has a few things to say about her as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Newt's ex-wife unloads.  Yeah.  Fucking ex-wives.  Shut your yaps.  Newt doesn't seem like a nice guy.  No, I don't.  I want a nice guy president.  I don't really know much about his policies in general, but I like his attitude.  Yeah.  I really do.  He's been he's been around long enough where he doesn't care.  He doesn't have to fucking sit there and and and sugarcoat everything.  He seems to be lesser of a bullshitter and the rest of them. 
[00:33:30]  I say lesser because I'm sure there's some bullshit in there as well.  Yeah, that's what I think.  But.  Oh, they're looking at him like he's fucking, you know, the Antichrist, though.  The opposition.  But Mitt Romney should have this thing already.  Yeah.  Doesn't that make you nervous?  These guys should be dropping out and letting Mitt have this thing.  Yeah.  They refuse to.  Now, especially Newt.  I think Newt thinks this is his time when he was up there at the top of the polls. 
[00:34:00]  He probably felt like, all right, I'm in.  Yeah.  And then he drops down.  He's like, I'm not leaving.  If Newt could get South Carolina, it's still a long shot, right?  Yeah.  What happens then?  I don't fucking know.  I don't know.  I'm just voting for the other guy.  The other guy than Obama.  I don't care who it is.  And also today, Vinny from Jersey Shore. 
[00:34:30]  Ooh.  I saw the latest episode of Jersey Shore.  Very sad.  Vinny left the house.  No.  And everyone's saying, you're going to regret it, dude.  Oh, boy.  You can't do this.  I didn't see that one.  You're going to regret leaving the house.  I saw that little troll and her.  Snooki?  Her troll friend yelling at fucking people in the house.  Well, Snooki wants respect now, yeah.  Good luck.  You know.  What kind of respect is she getting?  She wants everyone to ignore the fact that she can't even stand up on half the episodes  of Jersey Shore.  I know. 
[00:35:00]  And she shows off her cooch.  Falling down drunk.  She wants respect now from everyone.  So let's give her that.  Isn't it Sammy that calls her a meatball?  Yeah, they're meatballs.  That's hilarious.  They're meatballs, though.  Yeah, she's a meatball.  She's shaped like a fucking meatball.  Her and what?  Dina?  Whatever that fucking...  Dina?  The one she dragged into the house.  Dina was on our show.  Whatever.  Whatever.  You didn't like her.  Huh?  Oh, right.  She was.  You didn't like her?  I forgot that she was even on our show.  I don't really have much of an opinion on her. 
[00:35:30]  I don't know.  I like Pauly D.  It's not my taste.  I like Vinny.  And I like Sammy and her legs.  She was in here with those legs.  Sammy ain't bad.  J-Wouse is all right, I guess.  I just worry about all the plastic surgery she's getting.  And what's wrong with Vincenzo there?  Vincenzo.  Anxiety.  He gets anxiety.  And, you know, there's too much going on.  A lot of shit going on in that hoose.  Yeah, so he had to step out.  I wonder how long he's gone for.  A lot of these guys go home for a day and they make it look like. 
[00:36:00]  Is that it?  And then they make it look like they've been gone for a month.  Through editing, it's like.  Well, it's either that or, like, the Jersey Shore people or, like, dogs.  You know when you leave your house and you go, oh, fuck, I forgot my wallet.  Right, right.  And you go back in and the dog's like, oh, my God, you're back.  Hey.  You're back.  You're back.  You've gone so long.  And what, they figured out that dogs don't have fucking short-term memory or something?  Yeah, they just don't know.  So if you leave, they assume you've been gone forever? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  I think it might be like that with the Jersey Shore house.  Yeah.  Because they leave for a day.  They go home, get some home cooking.  Yeah, they're not there the whole time.  And then they come back and, you know, everyone's so excited to see them even though they've been gone like one night.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, we'll ask Vinny.  We'll see what he says today.  Yeah.  I don't know if he could give away too much because...  He probably can't, but he could talk about his affliction, I guess.  I bet you look at those scenes, some of the scenes closely, and you see him like back in a doorway. 
[00:37:00]  He didn't even leave the house.  I'm leaving this room.  Right.  Just stay out of sight for a day or two.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll edit around you.  Because it'll make for good TV.  He's got a great video online, actually.  Yeah.  He wants to be part of the NBA Celebrity All-Star Game, I think.  Oh.  And he made a video of him just fucking making shots left and right.  Really?  He's good?  Now, granted, you know, you could hang out on a basketball court for hours and then edit it to make it look like you're sinking them from everywhere.  But with that said, he's making a lot of really long shots. 
[00:37:30]  But whoever made the video failed because they didn't go landscape.  What?  They didn't go landscape.  What the fuck is wrong with me?  I'm Kenny Guadagnino, and this is why you should pick me for the NBA game.  Who fucking?  Look, three-quarters court, nothing but net.  Half court, nothing but net.  Half court from the other side, nothing but net.  Half court from that side, nothing but net. 
[00:38:00]  Can we look at the clocks in the room?  I know.  I wish you could.  I saw a few shots with a clock in it, right?  Or at least one.  Yeah, but that was five monster shots he did.  The one from three-quarter court is very impressive.  That's pretty, yeah.  You got a shot to put that.  Obviously, he probably had to take a hundred shots.  Yeah, I don't know how many.  But still, he made it.  He didn't make it.  But the idiot who filmed it went fucking portrait.  Tip your camera over.  Tip your phone over on its side.  Why can't people do that?  They're dummies. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, idiots.  Food?  I got my sandwich.  I'm ready to eat.  All right, we got a busy show.  Tom Papa will be joining the show next.  Also, we got any more best man speeches today?  Oh, I hope so.  I don't know if we do.  I know we got the one that Danny pulled.  Yeah, that's it.  And we got a guy that hit a 10-inch .38 caliber somewhere on his batte.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all man.  I don't know if it's all man.  Well, yeah.  You think that's all man?  No.  Okay.  We'll explain next. 
[00:39:00]  Sirius XM, the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time. 
[00:39:30]  I've been knocking on the door that holds the throne.  I've been looking for the map that leads me home.  I've been stumbling on good hearts to rest.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute. 
[00:40:00]  With the sex man.  Oh, boy.  We told him to challenge us.  Yeah.  I think this is Bruce Springsteen.  Right?  I don't even know the name of the song, though.  It's really obscure.  See, we didn't want an obscure song every time.  Like, yesterday he played some obscure Michael Jackson thing, and now I don't even know what  the fuck this is.  But, all right.  We've got to see what it is first.  Good morning, Sexy.  Good morning.  Oh.  Bruce Springsteen's birthday? 
[00:40:30]  No.  It can't be that easy.  We told E-Rock to shake it up a little bit and make it very difficult.  Little Steven's birthday?  No.  Does it have anything to do with Bruce?  That it does.  I'll say that already.  I don't like it already.  No.  Is it because he's going to announce a new tour?  No.  Well, I guess you could tie it into that, but this wasn't the reason.  What's the name of the song?  We take care of our own.  What?  We take care of our own. 
[00:41:00]  Clarence Clemens died a year ago.  No.  A year ago.  Not the last month.  Clarence Clemens is still dead.  Right.  He's still a bit warm.  All right.  The WWF restaurant opened in Times Square 12 years ago?  Yes, that's it.  Exactly.  Oh, all right.  What the fuck?  Anyone?  Any guesses out there?  E-Rock is stumping us today with his choice. 
[00:41:30]  Is this a brand new Bruce Springsteen song?  That it is.  I've never heard this before.  This is a brand new single, which what?  Comes out today?  Today.  Oh.  Is that what it is?  That's not outside the box at all.  Is that what it is?  It's fucking topical.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This could be the worst.  What are you yelling?  This is the worst one ever.  I'm tired of this shit.  Worst one ever.  Why?  Because it's topical and relevant to today. 
[00:42:00]  All you did was play the...  With one of the major rock stars out there.  There's brand new songs out.  But you played the song.  So I should go obscure and play Born to Run for the millionth time.  No, you shouldn't play any Bruce.  Yeah, you don't really have...  You should have...  Like, I would like to...  You really don't have original thoughts in your head.  Oh, well.  That's what I would have done.  You just played the new Bruce song and...  I finally figured it out because I've never heard this song before.  I kind of know...  It's topical.  ...a bunch of Bruce racing songs, but...  Oh, my God.  All right.  Wow.  It's not like you guys said that. 
[00:42:30]  By the way, this song sucks.  It just sits there.  It's terrible.  Roland, you can't say this is good.  It's not bad.  It just sits there.  What is it?  It sounds like Bruce Light.  It really does, right?  It's like old man Bruce.  Oh, Tom Papa.  Tom Papa's in.  Good morning.  Finally.  Good morning.  Roland let him in?  I know.  Roland let him in.  No, Roland didn't let me in.  What?  I was here ten minutes ago.  I swear to God, I'm not making this up.  And I'm sitting at security. 
[00:43:00]  Your name's not on the list, Tom.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry, what?  No, you're...  Are you going 018?  Yeah, I'm going 0...  Yeah, I'm on the air in a minute.  I think...  Immediately, I just started thinking, oh, that fucker did it again.  And this time, he didn't even email me when I was about to leave the house.  The goal, I think, of Roland is to have you bumped right at the door.  Right at the door to the studio.  It's like, ah, Tom, I'm sorry.  Not today.  That's my last thing.  Why do you think I'm so fat, the stress you guys put me through? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, what?  No.  Oh, wait, everyone else for your problems.  You think that shit's going to work with us?  Yeah.  As Mark Wahlberg says, it's on your head.  Where is Stressburger?  Don't turn into Winnie the Pooh so we don't give you the pummeling you deserve.  I mean, he...  It's the way he does it.  Right.  It's this...  Look, I mean, that's why I've never just walked into the studio before, but I come in  with my hat and coat because there's no one to walk me into the show.  You had to single-handedly bring yourself up. 
[00:44:00]  Who's Travis Teft?  That's the guy on my security thing.  Oh, shit.  No, you guys know...  Who is Travis Teft?  Travis Teft.  Oh, he's Dr. Gay.  Oh, Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay lets me in.  Dr. Gay.  Dr. Gay will get you in.  That's like a velvet rope.  He's the executive producer of the show.  Well, you're Hollywood, man.  You should be treated better, I'm thinking.  Holy shit.  I just...  Look, I love this show.  I love being here.  And you get excited. 
[00:44:30]  You want me to come in for Jimmy?  That's wonderful.  I'll cancel my spots the night before.  Oh, Roland.  So it's nice and fresh.  And you get up early.  You get dressed.  You shower.  You are all ready to go.  I just waited for some coffee.  I just popped the phone just to screw around just out of nervous habit.  Whoa.  Roland.  It's 645.  Oh, my God.  Could you do the same time tomorrow?  When the fuck was this sent? 
[00:45:00]  Two minutes ago.  Who said two minutes?  I am dressed.  It's dark out.  Holy shit.  I'm completely...  My whole comedian schedule fucked.  Yeah.  Can you come tomorrow?  And then it's the way...  It's this passive-aggressive...  It's not like, look.  Hey, I double-booked you and Brewer.  It's not going to work.  Fuck.  Brewer's coming from New Jersey.  Come tomorrow.  Cool.  Fine.  Right.  Would it be...  Do you think maybe you could...  Tomorrow?  Well, I don't know.  Are the guys saying they want me tomorrow? 
[00:45:30]  Are they saying...  Well, it's just...  With Martin Luther King Day, I double-booked.  And we weren't here on Monday, and now I'm just...  So, do you want me to come or do you not want me to come?  Yeah.  It gives you this shitty feeling like, well, if I do come...  Well, the guy said you can come if you want to.  What do you mean they said I can come?  If I want to.  You don't want to hear that.  No.  If you want to.  You know what the translation of that is?  It would be better if you didn't. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Please don't.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.  Please don't.  But if you have to, you needy bastard, come on in.  I take a shower, I get a text from our executive producer, okay, move Tom.  I don't want to move you.  I just take the orders.  Well, but see what, Roland didn't tell everyone that there was a double booking.  We found out about the double booking really late, too. 
[00:46:30]  Really?  Yes, Roland.  If you check the emails.  Yes, Roland.  On this one, you were wrong.  Oh.  Yes.  Of course.  If you want to.  I mean, there's going to be a microphone.  There's a microphone open.  The guys, they don't want to talk to you.  They don't want you on the show today.  But if you want, you can tell me to sit there.  We have that couch in the back.  We can sit down on the couch.  Yeah, and you never want to be sitting on the couch. 
[00:47:00]  Because no one looks at you.  So humiliating.  Yeah.  That is bad.  So now that we know that we're Roland's problems, what did you eat yesterday because  of us?  You ate a fucking burger and ice cream.  What do you think?  Oh, wow.  Burger and ice cream.  Same time?  The Paula Deen diet.  Did you dip it?  Did you just dip the burger and ice cream?  Yeah.  I just had that once.  And this, by the way, is on the heels of Tom being relegated to a phoner on the shit show  for his big special.  You didn't want to bring that up?  Oh, I did. 
[00:47:30]  That was on me.  What was that about?  I was listening on the way home.  That was John McDermott.  You were listening on the way home.  I was mortified.  I'm in L.A.  My Comedy Central special is coming out, so I obviously can't be in here, but let me  call the guys.  This would be great.  And I was even looking forward to getting up real early to do it.  Getting up real early and having you go.  Tom, I hear your special boo.  All right.  Yes.  That I've never been hung up on on the show.  I was looking forward to the big F you from the West Coast. 
[00:48:00]  Wait.  Did we know about this phoner?  No.  No, you didn't know.  I don't think we did.  You didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  That was management trying to make a decision out there.  Tom Thomas.  You got my phone number?  No.  Yeah, you might need my phone number.  I need your phone number.  Yeah, yeah.  This is crazy because as I'm driving home, I'm listening to the Sam Roberts shit show.  And I'm driving and I hear, oh, on the phone we got Tom Papa. 
[00:48:30]  I'm like, why is Tom?  I can understand the likes of, you know, maybe Loverboy coming in when Loverboy was on your  show, Sam.  Or an almost star from Community, that type of thing.  Right.  But a guy that's becoming a regular on our show.  Yes.  And announcing a big fucking special.  And it's like, I'm like, wait.  Why is he on this show?  You know, and you're screwed up.  You're flying.  You're running around doing press.  I'm like, I'm not even, I'm screwing up the math.  I'm screwing up the East Coast, West Coast math.  I'm like, wait a minute. 
[00:49:00]  They're not even.  They're not on.  Okay, we're going to put you through.  Wait, wait.  They're done.  I've done the show.  I picture you guys with your cuffs on walking out the door.  I've done the show long enough to know they run for the elevator at 10.  Exactly.  Yeah.  We never knew about the phone number.  We would take a Tom Papa phone number for his Comedy Central special.  We don't like phoneers in general, but that's one we would absolutely take.  I expected it to last 30 seconds and be hung up on, which would have been hilarious.  It would have been great.  But we would have got the word out from the special. 
[00:49:30]  Hey, what's going on?  And then Sam has to drag out a 30-minute phone interview with you.  How long was it, Sam?  It was maybe five to six minutes.  It was long.  It was long.  We started talking about all weird shit.  What?  The comedy department, the morning of, goes, hey, Papa's calling in.  I go, what?  Did she get the email?  I go, no.  They go, the management knew.  I think, but she never told me.  It's not like I'm not even on the show.  It was John McDermott of the Comedy Club. 
[00:50:00]  He's a head of office up there.  It was so awkward to listen to that call.  Why?  I didn't hear that.  It was horribly awkward.  Because Tom is like, why am I on this show?  But he wasn't saying it.  But you knew, like, yeah, he was.  He was saying it.  But at first, it's just like, why am I on this show?  I was figuring it out.  What happened to O&A?  And then the awkwardness of Roland not fessing up with why this happened.  And he's like, Mr. Fucking Mystery.  We don't know. 
[00:50:30]  Because they told me, don't mention names.  Don't mention names.  Because they fucked up down there.  How about you mention a name?  John Papa to us.  Right.  Exactly.  And say he's calling.  You mention names on our show all the time.  Well, they told me at the last second when you guys were leaving.  Oh, yeah, he's calling in.  I was like, when?  What?  That was dumb on there.  And you knew you were calling, like.  Of course.  So why wasn't he calling our show?  Of course.  That was the catapult.  I don't want to be on with Bing Bong and the Dog Man out of.  Out of Des Moines, Iowa.  So who are you? 
[00:51:00]  They're good.  They're good.  So what's Jerry Seinfeld like?  Good.  Oh, God.  You know what I mean?  I've got hours of that.  We don't even mention Jerry when you're in here.  And then I get to come call you guys.  Fuck Jerry.  That's what we said.  Right, Tom?  Exactly.  Screw that guy.  And then I see on the list, like, oh, I can call you guys and just be, like, in a warm  tub.  Right.  And just talk like a normal human being.  Right.  Like, not do this fucking promote, promote thing.  It's just a natural conversation.  And then you're dealing with him. 
[00:51:30]  And then, hey, so you're really with Rob Zombie?  Like, how did he really directed your special?  How did you have...  I want to do something with Rob Zombie.  God, that's true.  That was awkward, too.  Sam's trying to be like, is there any way I could meet Rob Zombie through you?  And so he's trying to use you.  I didn't know what to say because I knew that there's no way that he didn't think he was  doing O&A.  All right.  And if we're really opening this up and we're really talking about this, the Roland disrespect 
[00:52:00]  of it all.  Yes.  Yes.  And I like Roland as a human being.  You look at him, he's adorable.  You want to rub his belly.  Human being.  He did the same thing to me, which was so much more awkward when on the day when all the  guys came in after Patrice's stroke.  Oh, right.  Were you supposed to be part of that?  I was booked for the show, and I love Patrice.  I know Patrice.  We came up together.  But I'm not as tight as Norton and...  Kelly and Quinn.  Yeah, I'm not as tight as those guys. 
[00:52:30]  But we were close.  You know, him and my wife and...  I mean, close.  And it was the same way he did it.  I wanted to come and pay respects.  He was like, it might be better if you don't come in today.  Oh, my God.  And it was like that shitty thing where, like, there's a death involved.  You do not want to storp, crash the party of that.  So you're totally evaluating, did I fit in?  Was I not a part of the...  Am I kind of...  Well, it might be better if you don't...  Maybe you could sit on the couch while the other guys talk about it. 
[00:53:00]  Maybe I didn't know him as well as I thought I did.  Exactly.  I guess I'm not in that circle.  Exactly.  Maybe I'm on the outside of that circle.  Yes.  And another circle over here.  Yes.  But they're not interested in that circle.  Yes.  No, I love Tom Papa.  And I feel so shitty about even bringing it up because it was that...  Right.  ...a week of feeling that.  Well, let it be known.  You should have been here that day.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  What the...  Oh, my God.  He should have been there.  Did we say something?  We didn't say shit.  No.  Okay. 
[00:53:30]  No, it was...  Jimmy was leading the pact of who wants to...  Oh, wow.  You can't...  If this gets back to Jimmy...  No, no, no.  It's not Jimmy, though.  It was like we had the full house.  If Jimmy has to sit there now and throw Roland under the bus like, I didn't fucking say any...  No, he said anything, though.  It was awful.  If I was not booked on the show that day, I do not expect a phone call saying, hey, come  in, as Jimmy's like, hey, Robert, hey, Colin, let's go.  But I'm booked.  And then to say, no, don't come in... 
[00:54:00]  Every other comedian is coming in.  It's just like, wait, what the fuck?  Were you thinking at one moment you weren't important enough to pay your respects to a  dead guy?  We're a family.  We're like, you know, we're together all the time.  Yeah, Tom?  Yeah, no, we're having comedians in today.  Yeah, you know comedians?  Exactly.  We all know you're famous because of Jerry Seinfeld.  Yeah.  Trust me.  You didn't spend 19 years sitting at the table having Patrice eviscerate you for everything 
[00:54:30]  from your wife to your shoes.  It was so uncomfortable.  I love Tom.  I mean, if there's other, like, Colin Cain or Jackie, I would say, fuck you guys.  I don't care.  He's true.  He's obsessed with Colin Cain.  It's almost like I would like...  And Jackie the Joke Man.  It's almost, and I respect that, Roland, but it's almost better if you do say fuck you  because it's the in-between of, well, I don't know, do you think that the guys really  want you?  I'm just a messenger.  I'm just a messenger.  What do you want?  Oh, boy.  Now that we all know.  I'm just a messenger.  I don't make the decisions. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, it feels good to actually say it because it felt so shitty.  I don't doubt it.  So it's been countless times.  We all know that we're the reason for your problems.  What kind of eating will happen today because of us?  Probably drinking, too.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, boy.  Lots of drinking.  Nice.  Honey.  Lots of honey.  Warm honey.  I'm sorry.  And what do you have for John McDermott?  Because he gave you a dick in the ass.  He's an asshole for not coming up here. 
[00:55:30]  He was, like, hit behind the management and said, don't tell me anything.  Don't tell anybody.  What?  About during the shit show?  Yeah, the phone.  We do an after show or whatever.  I mean, whatever.  I call it the after show show.  Because they want me to take the full blame, as always.  I'm like, whatever.  That's weird.  Tom Papa should have been on the regular show.  Well, thank you for your phone number.  Now I have direct line.  I bet you people around here don't even realize that our show goes to 10 now.  Maybe that's the case.  Probably because they come in at 10. 
[00:56:00]  They should know when they hear the brick wall that is the shit show, come on.  Oh, the disrespect.  I don't know why I didn't put you in the system today, though.  Oh, wow.  Thank God for Travis Taft.  How's your raise going?  How's your raise?  There you go.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  There's a fucking bag.  Fucking cheese shows.  Fucking 12 shows.  You still get paid zero.  I literally want to pay you. 
[00:56:30]  Go fuck yourselves.  Rowan's taking...  Rowan's shit.  That's guilt.  He's felt the guilt.  Rowan is really angry now.  No, it's because other people who have to take the blame.  Fine.  But you weren't mentioning those people.  You got to, you know, sometimes say, hey, these people are the assholes.  The assholes upstairs, to the right.  Because, you really have to be honest about that stuff, because, just as my thing as an 
[00:57:00]  example, you walk around thinking, well, did the guy say something?  Right.  Was it you?  Was it...  And so you have this negative feeling about, like, you know, when I walk in this morning  and it's dark out and I'm the only guy at security and they won't let me up, you start  thinking, mother...  Not again.  If it wasn't for the high self-esteem that comics have, I don't know how you would have made  it through there.  Exactly.  She said there was a glitch this morning in the system.  A glitch. 
[00:57:30]  You're the victim of a glitch.  I said nobody's going to believe me, so what the fuck?  I get fucked in the ass because you twat and you assholes can't hire good IT people,  so I get fucked.  What about Sam, though?  Sam, what happened?  He wasn't in the system today?  Yeah.  I guess there was a glitch.  I don't know.  Don't you think Rowan should have put him in the system and checked?  Of course I did.  Oh, Sam!  Oh, no!  Oh, no!  Don't worry.  Come Sunday when you have no guests on your fucking show. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, no!  Trust me.  I'll gather the talent department.  Trust me.  We're going to have lunch and I'll take care of this very quickly.  Talent department is serious.  He seems like such a sexy moron.  See, Rowan's very political.  He doesn't want to throw John McDermott under the bus because he knows if he keeps him close,  he can screw over Sam.  Ah, Sam.  But he sort of snows.  He can't bring anybody, so go ahead.  Rowan's the puppet master.  He really is.  He's working people against each other.  Oh, innocence.  Well, Tom looks good.  Where's Christopher Robin? 
[00:58:30]  Tom's one of these guys that prepares well for a radio show.  You're showered.  You've got a nice pressed shirt on.  I love coming in here.  You know I respect what happens here.  Yeah.  So, I had to do it twice in a row.  Tom, as you come past the fifth floor, could you please hit bottom again in the lobby?  You're not welcome here.  Sorry, we have Tigger.  Tigger's in today.  You don't fit well with Tigger.  Oh, the honeypot.  If I own him. 
[00:59:00]  Why a hamburger and ice cream when you're stressed out?  When I'm stressed out, I fucking do the gym thing.  Because I'm a rich.  You do the gym.  And I beat the shit out of my body that way.  Smart.  Because I'm poor, I just have burgers and just sit there and watch TV.  Nah, but you can walk around a block.  For what?  It does me no good.  It's like I see people happy.  No.  Stop that.  I'm being depressed and watching fucking TV and my Bravo and USA Network.  Ah, I'm happy now.  He likes Bravo.  Because it's the Bravo.  Because he's watching people that are messed up. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, so he's still good.  Sorry, Christopher Robin.  You're not in the system.  I'll bring some honey and not let you on the show.  Maybe you could sit in the lobby.  You could watch.  Talk to John McDermott on the stairs.  If you want.  That's how he does it.  He puts it on you at the end.  If you want is the way he ends all of his shit.  If you want. 
[01:00:00]  Well, of course I want to, but not...  If you want is a bad thing to hear.  It's like a girl, like, you want to make out?  Well, if you want.  If you want.  No, I want you to want.  Right, exactly.  Take the if you want out of your brain.  Because that's a bad one.  It really is.  When you hear that, that means, oh boy, that means that people don't want me.  Right.  But that's not true.  We wanted you, but we thought you would just sit there yesterday because Brewer fucking takes over.  It makes perfect sense.  It does, right?  Jim and I are friends, but I, even being friends, you don't want to be on the same show with Brewer. 
[01:00:30]  Right.  And have him going through the roof.  No.  Tell him, yeah.  But say that.  He told like a half hour story of a...  Well, he's great.  Well, he's different.  If you go, Brewer, how's your father?  You know the answer is going to be 30 minutes.  Right, exactly.  Okay.  And it's awesome.  We're not going to be punching back and forth.  You just watch and listen to his story.  All you have to do is say, the day before, Brewer's on, double booked, screwed up, how  about Thursday?  Great.  Yeah.  Not...  Yeah, but nobody tells me until 6.30 in the morning. 
[01:01:00]  Hello, Tom Papa.  Yes, a listener might come in today.  Could you come in maybe next month?  We're bumping you for a listener that said he loves the show and might want to come in.  That was a misunderstanding.  Yeah, at 6.30 I told Roland, we can't do this.  This is stupid.  Right.  But for some reason, I didn't get the message before that.  Well, it was Martin Luther King Day.  How is he bringing Martin Luther King?  Well, I know.  He had a dream.  I had a fucking Martin Luther King Day. 
[01:01:30]  Then you start feeling bad.  You're like, what, black people have something to do with this?  Yeah.  That figures.  Oh, am I a racist?  Am I trying to come in the show?  I figured he had a bad day.  Everybody had a bad day.  MLK.  MLK, right, right.  Nathan Brimmer on Twitter.  Why aren't you guys shitting on Roland Moore for this?  Because we know he would rip your fucking head off.  You've got to tread lightly.  You've got to be careful with Roland.  His eyes start spinning.  He drilled a fastball bottle of water, full bottle of water, into the window about three minutes ago.  He wanted to throw that at somebody. 
[01:02:00]  I thought it was coming in my head.  At Sam.  When he talked about why he doesn't want to walk around the block  and see people happy, I saw a look in his eye.  I never saw it before.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Roland comes off like a nice, gentle teddy bear.  No.  He will rip your fucking head off.  He's like that.  I mean, literally.  Roland's like that panda video where you see the panda reaching through the bars and biting that woman.  Yes.  It's like, but it's adorable.  Why is it killing me?  I'm dying from a panda. 
[01:02:30]  He's not going to let go of your winter coat anytime soon.  No.  Oh, my God.  Now we've got videos of...  Look at that.  Yeah, that's Roland.  That's Roland.  That's Roland.  It's fucking happy man.  Fuck you.  That's fucking Roland.  And that's Tom Papa outside the cage.  Wait, I have food for you.  I want to feed you.  Look at it.  It's fucking killing him.  The video is Panda Rips Off Man's Jacket on YouTube.  That's Roland.  That's Roland. 
[01:03:00]  I just wanted to be put in the system.  And now that's Roland distressing.  I'll do the shit show.  I'll do the shit show.  That's fucking Roland.  You're a panda bear.  Holy shit.  He is.  He's black and he's dressed in black and white.  Yeah, you are.  You're dressed like a panda today.  Yes.  That's Roland right there.  Really?  You fuck.  It's adorable, yet it's killing me.  If I'm a panda, I'm going to take a shit on John McDermott's desk.  Oh, man.  His name is now. 
[01:03:30]  So when he comes in at noon and then takes a lunch, then another lunch, then another lunch,  and then actually does work, and then blames me.  Oh, shit.  You're trying to say that he takes three lunches?  That's impossible.  He walks more than Jesus.  Oh, man.  Shit.  He walks more than Jesus, meaning he goes on a lot of breaks.  He walks to go get something to eat.  He walks to, you know, right?  Roland's at the clothesline.  Hung out to dry.  Oh, hung out to dry, bitches.  What happened? 
[01:04:00]  I know.  Look at those teeth.  I know.  He gets very angry.  Yeah.  He's dressed like a panda.  He's literally dressed like a panda.  His face is right there.  His face turns into Danny DeVito as the penguin, too.  Yeah.  Right?  Yes.  Like that.  Yes.  Wow.  The eyes start darting.  That gives it away.  Yeah.  Here's Roland.  You can't hide the eyes.  Here's Roland when he gets pissed.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  That's terrible. 
[01:04:30]  Give me DeVito.  It's the penguin.  Oh, my God.  You start looking like that.  That is insane.  You get very...  That is scary.  I take back everything I said.  But Roland gets confused.  We love you.  You do a great job.  He does a fantastic job here.  Just every once in a while something happens.  It's a glitch.  Tom Pop is cool about it, right?  Sam Paul's in a glitch in the system.  Of course.  And then you have those people cover up for me.  Oh, I messed up.  And you're like, fine.  I'll help you out.  Oh, wow.  And then they run away like little pussies.  They leave you there. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Holding the bag, as they say.  Yeah.  And they're walking around taking 50 lunches.  Hey, are you going to Del Frisco's?  No, you fat ass.  I can't afford it.  Take me, you fucker.  Instead of 50 lunches, you prefer one big one.  That's right.  Yeah.  Right after that.  What are you eating today?  Pizza?  I don't know.  I'm just going to probably just drink my lunch.  You know what I'm thinking?  Liquid lunch.  Liquid lunch.  I love that.  Roland, you know what I'm thinking?  Pizza party.  Can we throw Roland a pizza party?  Pizza party.  Roland needs a little one.  Pizza party for what?  No, every once in a while, Roland will throw a pizza party. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, really?  And then he has a guest list.  And he doesn't invite certain people.  Oh, it's like a velvet rope.  It's brutal.  It's a velvet rope at the 6x6 prison cell office.  Roland truly an asshole.  He's really a gatekeeper.  He really...  He literally...  He had a DJ, everything.  Reality celebrities stopped by.  And the people who wanted to come in, I go, get away.  Mind you, it is in a prison cell size room.  I know how that feels.  Yeah, yeah.  I know how that feels.  I'm on the outside of his pizza party this whole week. 
[01:06:00]  Turned away.  And I made a company newsletter.  I was helping morale as serious.  Look, what?  That's the pictures from his last pizza party.  It looks like it's in the space shuttle.  Look at this.  There's no room.  I wonder if Tavis Teft is in there.  Yes, yes.  There's probably 20 people in that office that could hold comfortably maybe four people.  It's not an office, really.  Look, Ronnie was invited from Ron and Fez.  Wow.  Pizza party.  Pizza party.  There's girls.  There's Sam. 
[01:06:30]  Instigator Sam Roberts from the shit show.  I'm the instigator.  Guys from the shit show are invited.  I don't see any reality stars.  I don't see any reality stars.  I don't either.  Sam was there in some of the other pictures.  Kid Kelly was there.  Who's he?  He's a radio legend.  Kid Kelly?  I don't know him.  He works here?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Who's that?  The girls were there.  She's an intern.  It doesn't work here anymore.  Aw.  Moved on to bigger and better things.  Did she?  Her semester was over.  Oh, okay. 
[01:07:00]  I thought she might be.  Now she's in her third trimester.  Ah.  Well, I don't.  All right.  I'm glad we got to the source of it.  Yeah.  Now you got my phone number.  Yeah.  This is a great national show.  You have to get the host's private phone number.  Right.  To deal with any business or snafus at security.  Cut out the middle man.  Cut out the middle company.  I think it's time.  It's time to have my number. 
[01:07:30]  Hey, Opie.  Could you put me in the system?  Ah.  Fine.  Whatever.  Oh, that was a direct jab at you, Roland.  By Sam.  Why do I have any more guests on Sunday?  Why do you say they love me?  Sam, you tell him you don't need guests for your new radio show.  Oh, he does.  I would like guests, but I don't need guests.  You don't?  Okay.  You're not going to play his game, though, right?  Right, Sam?  That's right.  All right.  I'll talk to the talent.  When we have lunch, all of us, I'll go, hey, Sam doesn't want guests, guys.  Because your enough begging for guests was pretty sad.  Wow.  Wow.  Is he trying to get guests for his web show? 
[01:08:00]  Who wouldn't?  For his podcast?  Which show?  No, for his Sunday show.  Sunday show.  Book for the podcast.  Tom Poppe, you want to do?  I'm looking at my calendar.  I think I'm doing that show.  They told me to come in at 5 a.m. on Sunday.  It was supposed to be Letterman.  It was supposed to be Letterman, but you've been bumped.  Right.  By the way, a lot of people were very surprised that we're scared of Roland.  Why don't you?  Please, people, have you been listening? 
[01:08:30]  Should we play the Master Poe clip?  Oh, my God.  That was brutal.  Or you can visit him in Florida right now.  Oh, no.  What do you know about the Poe?  I heard he's in Florida probably robbing shit or something.  Well, look.  I don't feel like it, Sue.  He said probably.  I don't know what the fuck he's up to.  I don't either.  I haven't seen him since he left the company.  Look at Marikismos 1 at your place.  I don't know if that's true.  I would say it's not true.  Oh, my God.  What is it?  Don't take us down.  It's a guy that used to be security for our show. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  And, well, he was a colorful character as far as his personality goes.  He had an interesting work ethic.  Uh-huh.  And a very strange, twisted way of looking at certain things.  Yeah.  It's as far as I'll go.  Or I can fucking hire a lawyer.  Oh, really?  Definitely a scary character.  He would rip your head off.  He knew karate and shit.  Oh, really? 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  And he was definitely intimidating.  Ah.  And, you know, he got under Roland's skin one day.  Wow.  Do we have that clip?  I'm looking for it.  All right.  Oh.  He got under Roland's skin.  Oh, yeah.  And this just tells you a lot about Roland's staff.  Wasn't this the first time we actually saw Roland as mean Roland?  Oh, yeah.  Like, we thought Roland just went around like, hey, jolly guy.  Happy, good, lucky, funny, you.  He took on Eastside Dave, too, right?  And then it was like.  He took on Rich Voss.  Yeah.  And took on Rich Voss.  And he went after Master Puff. 
[01:10:00]  With a lot of Jew stuff.  Right?  Oh, no.  It was.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Just anti-Semitic stuff came out.  It was great.  I think I found the video here.  Oh, there's the video.  Oh, there's the video.  It's Dan and the coat is coming off through bars in a cage.  I know.  That is such.  That's Roland.  I can eat your face if you want.  I can rip your arms up if you want.  Is this what you want?  Oh, my God.  We got the Master Poe. 
[01:10:30]  E-Rock's still looking for it.  E-Rock.  Do you got the Eastside Dave thing?  What do we got?  We got to show one versus the Poe.  All right.  This is a 10-minute video.  Roland versus Master Poe.  Yeah.  10-minute videos just don't work.  There's a video.  I guess one of us made it called Stupid Ninja Master Poe Goes Nuts on Opie and Anthony.  You got to label it Stupid Ninja Master Poe.  Holy shit.  29,000 views.  Ah.  Opie and Anthony Roland. 
[01:11:00]  What's that?  I remember this was because Master Poe thought it would be okay to tickle Roland.  All right.  And Roland thought he was a little too severe with his touch.  All right.  And so Roland flipped out on him.  Oh, boy.  It's a long video, though.  And his sound quality is not good.  Yeah.  I just need the quick clip for Tom.  Yeah.  The panda one's fine.  I get it.  I get it.  Yeah.  That'll tell you a lot right there.  Yeah, we thought one thing.  And then when he turned, we were like, wow, this guy's no one to fuck with. 
[01:11:30]  Wow.  All right.  Eastside Dave versus...  Oh, that's versus Master Poe, yeah.  Is that a long, too?  Yeah.  All right.  Forget it.  It's all good.  All right, Roland.  All's good.  It's fine.  Would you like breakfast, Mr.  We've settled it.  Yes.  I'll get you a breakfast.  What do you want?  What do you want?  What do you want?  What would you like?  If you want.  No, no.  You want coffee?  If you want.  How about some honey?  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Eeyore, get him some honey, please. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, Piglet.  Do you think we should let him in?  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Should we take a break so Tom Popper can get his breakfast order in?  Yeah.  If you want.  Yeah.  If you want.  Yeah.  Roland, it's all good, man.  Relax.  It's all good.  Don't worry.  It's all good, Roland.  Don't stress eat because of us.  I'll be drinking in two minutes.  Don't blame us for your problems.  When does drinking start today?  No.  No.  All right.  Tom Popper.  Yes, sir.  7.36 a.m.  Let's do this.  Tom Popper on Twitter.  He's a really good one to follow. 
[01:12:30]  We'll start there.  This weekend at Hasbrook Heights.  Bananas, right?  Bananas.  In Hasbrook Heights, Friday and Saturday, 201-727-1090.  And Tom Popper live in New York City.  Available now on iTunes.  Very cool.  Thank you.  What is that?  Is that the CD?  That's the special.  Well, if you listen to the shit show, you would know.  Did Rob Zombie really direct it?  Off my Comedy Central special.  Now you can download the full-length album on iTunes.  Very, very cool.  Okay.  Thank you. 
[01:13:00]  Tom Popper's going to eat, and we'll continue.  When you need radio gold, he's the one that you call.  With happy movie reviews, wears his shirts extra small.  The one you can count on the book a guest for a session, but ends every single sentence  he says in a question.  No pronunciation, soft-spoken, and mumbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic, and he clumbles.  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonadeus, Bonadeus, check him out Friday-wide.  It's rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'.  It's rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'.  It's rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'.  It's rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'. 
[01:13:30]  That's good.  I mean, that action, suspense.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Got Tom Popper in studio.  I can only imagine what Rollin's doing in my coffee.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that was bold of you.  When he asked for...  When he asked you if you want breakfast, I'm like, Tom, just say no. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, no, say no.  Say no, Tom.  Say no.  It's going to be panda bites out of it.  Say no.  One of the interns came up to Rollin' and said, I'll go and do the order.  He goes, no, no, no, I got it.  And he went in the elevator.  Oh, no.  What do you think?  He's not crazy enough to do arsenic.  I know that.  There's something.  Something's going to happen.  Something that'll kick in about six hours from now.  Well, you got my number.  Let me know.  Let me know what happens.  I'm now curious.  I'm now in. 
[01:14:30]  I can call 911 if you want.  Yeah.  We're back with the Mark Wahlberg thing because it's all over the place.  Yeah, yeah.  People are really...  We talked about it earlier today, but basically, he said if he was on that plane, and he was  supposed to be on that plane, he canceled his plans to do a film festival in Boston,  I believe.  Yeah.  He said that fucking plane would not have gone down.  And it's pissing off a lot of people today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just...  You know what it is?  It's not even just that he said that.  It's what he said, the way he said it.  What did he say?  He goes, there'd be blood all over the first class section. 
[01:15:00]  And then I'd say, and he said that, and then I'd say, don't worry, people, we're landing  this plane.  And Morgan Freeman's the president.  And, oh, God.  It's like...  I was with him until he said, and then we'll land this plane.  Then we'll land this plane, bitches.  How are we going to do that there, Mark?  You're now in the cockpit.  Everyone's dead.  And you're there.  Yeah.  So walk us through how we landed now.  Well, it says in the script that I land the plane. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doesn't it say that in here?  Yeah.  Didn't he used to dance in his underwear?  What happened?  Right?  Am I mistaken?  Marky Mark knows how to land a plane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He put the headset on.  Hey.  Hey, up here.  Mayday.  I just took out the terrorists.  You know, they do that in movies a lot.  You think it's possible, though?  You're the dummy in the cockpit.  You put the headset on.  You think you can land a plane?  Oh.  Well, I was watching a few shows where I survived. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  And there was a guy that had no flight experience in a Cessna.  And he was able to land that.  The guy talked him in.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He brought him in.  They had him circle around while he kind of learned some of the controls and what to  do.  They gave him a little flight lesson up there.  And, yeah, the pilot died.  Jeez.  Just died on him.  And he had his wife and two kids in the plane also.  So he's just like, ah.  And he got on the radio and didn't even know how to work the radio to get people. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, it was a small Cessna or something?  Yeah.  And so another pilot saw.  And he was on the same frequency.  So he told the airport.  He goes, look, I'm listening to this guy.  He's yelling for help.  Oh, my God.  And then another pilot knew how to fly that particular plane, got on the radio with him  and kind of, he said, just follow me down.  And the guy has to follow.  He's like, all right, get your speed up.  Now, now, you know, do you know pulling back, pushing for him, throttling.  So why do you have to take hundreds of hours of flight lessons? 
[01:17:00]  Well, he did kind of bouncy bounce a little bit on his wheels.  But he did, he put it down on the three wheels, so he was fine.  And everybody was good.  I'm talking about jet.  Now, a jet airline, that would be a little more difficult.  There's a lot of distractions in there.  Make sure.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  Tom Pop is.  Just spitting this.  Has arrived.  Just seriously, dude.  Just spitting this.  And now Roland's trying to find all the stuff he threw. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  He's cleaning up.  He's cleaning up.  He feels guilty after his tirade.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Good luck with that sandwich.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what kind of a background you'd think.  Doesn't the computer do it?  No, everybody thinks that.  I mean, there is something called the instrument landing system.  And that kind of, that'll set you up and bring you down to the runway.  But you do kind of need a hands-on when you're actually touching the plane down to flare it out. 
[01:18:00]  Right.  I know some planes do have that, but a majority of the planes don't have a system where it's going to automatically land the fucking plane.  Yeah.  And then you've got to know how to put the brakes on, back the engines up.  There's just stuff I think you've got to know.  And even to be able to get the ILS to work, you've got to know how to do that.  Right.  A jet, I think you'd have to circle a little longer for your lessons with that.  Of course, the ILS.  And you've got the ILS.  Instrument landing system.  Oh, you knew that too, right? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, sure.  Of course.  Marky Mark told me.  Marky Mark, when he was bringing it in, coated with blood.  He's wiping the sweat and blood off his head.  Everyone's dead around him.  He's just like, I'm bringing it in.  Ladies and gentlemen, tuck for crash position.  Here it comes.  This is your pilot, Mark Wahlberg speaking.  I hope you enjoyed your fight in the show, which is me kicking some terrorist ass.  Bringing it in now.  I'm keeping my nose up. 
[01:19:00]  We're going to keep the shiny side up and the dirty side down.  I'm doing karate moves up here, in case you haven't seen.  Yeah, I am Mark Wahlberg, and I defeated the terrorists.  You owe me, bitches.  You owe me.  Go see my new movie, Planet of the Age.  See ya.  It's time sensitive.  That's a new movie on 9-11, I think.  Yeah.  And now, for your listening pleasure, a little of my music.  Come on, brother, Jeff.  I'm flying in Calvin Klein underwear, and I'm covered in blood. 
[01:19:30]  Bringing it in with a hot, sexy stew as my co-pilot.  And I'm feeling her titties right now.  Mark Wahlberg.  Cigars and Scotch writes, that's easy to say when you have the Funky Bunch watching your back.  Yeah.  The Funky Bunch versus Al-Qaeda.  Right.  Feel it.  Feel it.  Yeah, look at that.  That's the guy who was going to kick some fucking ass.  He'll take down some terrorists. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  He'll do some ad work.  I just put the flaps down, and I don't know, it's something irregular.  I'm feeling some good vibrations.  Yeah.  Good vibrations.  Woo.  Woo.  Woo.  Everybody, put on your oxygen mask.  I'm going to plump some nitrous through this bitch.  Woo.  He would have been crying underneath the seat.  Yeah.  Like everyone else.  My career.  What?  But I'm doing so well. 
[01:20:30]  You can't cut my face.  Yeah.  It's a box cutter.  Cut that woman.  Cut her.  Right.  They'll be cool.  They'll land us.  It'll be cool.  They said we're going to go to New York.  It'll be cool.  Yeah.  It'll be cool.  Everyone just sit down and be cool.  Just do what they said.  Yeah.  You'll be all right.  And that's what everyone did because they didn't know.  Of course.  Be cool, man.  Everybody just settle down.  You had no idea at that moment what was going to happen.  Yeah.  You thought you were going to land at JFK and fucking, you know, have to deal with some 
[01:21:00]  negotiator.  Right.  A little hostage situation.  Maybe get a little hungry.  Just mad because you're not getting food.  A little dehydration, maybe.  It's cool.  Excuse me, Mr. Terrace.  Could we at least get the air conditioning on in here?  All right.  We are working on it.  We are working on it.  We want some of our demands met.  The first because it, ah, fucking demands.  I mean, does this mean we're not going to get the heated nuts?  Yeah.  You know, I paid for first class.  I want, like, fucking champagne and then the food. 
[01:21:30]  We usually get an entertainment system.  Yeah.  Are we still going to get that?  Ms. Terrace, is it okay if I watch my latest motion picture?  Yeah, Mr. Marky.  Marky hindsight mark.  It certainly was a game changer, right?  Yeah.  The Italian cruise captain.  Have you been following this guy's story?  This one's great.  I know.  I know some people die, but this guy.  What a coward. 
[01:22:00]  This guy is a class act, man.  Holy shit.  We did have a few injuries of some people.  Like the Jaws mare.  You get back on the boat and you tell us if there's women in trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  The transcripts from yesterday were fucking hilarious.  With the one quote, you get back on that boat for fuck's sake.  For fuck's sake.  It's like, wow, he got his ass reamed out.  Yeah.  And now there's t-shirts with that saying on it.  Really?  In Italian.  Right.  It sounds so romantic. 
[01:22:30]  Right.  In Italian.  If I was on that boat for fuck's sake.  If I was on the bridge, I'd have fucking tilted that wheel over and we'd have spun and missed  that rock.  Woo-hoo.  That's what I appreciate.  I swear, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, if you're on the Lido deck for  the chocolate buffet, stay there.  If there's no emergency, Marky, Mark is at the helm, bitches.  I got the power. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Marky, what about the tsunami?  Would you fuck it?  I'd ride that wave in on the cruise ship.  Yeah.  Everyone would still be doing a combo.  I'm feeling hot, hot, hot.  You ain't it?  You ain't it?  You ain't it?  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  I'm on the bridge, people.  Don't you fear.  I threw the captain overboard.  He fell in a lifeboat.  What about the earthquake in Japan?  Fuck that.  I'd be at that nuclear power plant going, get back in that water, you nuclear piles.  I'd be covered in radioactive shit saying, we're going to cool down this reactor. 
[01:23:30]  And then I'd speak Mandarin or something.  Because I could know everything away to Japan.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Anyway, the Italian captain, now it comes out that he tripped.  Yeah.  He said he, because they're all over his shit for abandoning ship and leaving everyone to  their own devices.  Can I ask Tom, though?  Yeah.  As a man, you would just fucking abandon ship.  It doesn't matter that's your job to be the last guy on the boat, right? 
[01:24:00]  No, it does.  But most guys would abandon ship.  No.  You're the captain of the ship.  I would.  You would.  If we're hanging out.  Oh, you think they're hiring guys that are actually going to do the right thing when it  actually comes down to it?  Yes.  You're the captain of the ship.  You have to.  You have to.  That's that special kind of person that gets hired for that.  It's like Sully's fucking Captain Sully.  That's a question.  He didn't just go, ah, I got no engines.  But that's, ah, he landed that fucking thing on the Hudson.  Well, he had no choice.  It was either that.  Or freak out. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  But this guy had a choice to save his own life.  If Sully had a chance to save his own life.  You think if Sully had a parachute, he'd fucking jump?  Yeah, no way.  Chicken Captain Sully Sullenberger.  We'll jump on a fucking parachute.  If he was the only one with a parachute, absolutely he would have fucking parachuted a  safety.  I'd have fucking landed that thing in the river.  And I'd have swum with everybody on my back.  I got fucking muscles.  Good fucking shit.  Good fucking shit.  Good shit.  I'd have swiped down in my underwear and jumped off the wing like fucking a swimmer. 
[01:25:00]  And I wouldn't have landed in the Hudson.  We would have landed on the roof of the W.  And we would have been a huge party.  We're the fucking men.  We're not going to get my shoes wet.  Look, you're going for a job as the cruise captain, right?  And they have that question.  Will you be the last man if you have to be?  Of course you check yes.  But when it comes down to it, are you really fucking the last guy in the boat?  You're making it sound like he's coming from a fucking Walmart cash register job and filling 
[01:25:30]  out the I want to be a captain of a cruise ship application.  It's a training process where it's like in the military.  They build you up.  You're supposed to have that kind of gumption and responsibility.  You're programmed.  Yeah, you're programmed as a ship's captain to be really as you have to steer the boat.  You're you're you have to be programmed a moral obligation to check all those things. 
[01:26:00]  But when it comes down to it, I think most fucking captains would say, fuck this.  Oh, wow.  You see those those deadliest catch guys.  Right.  Well, those are real men, though.  Other people fall over, but they're not Italian.  They jump right in after them.  They've been on cruise ships.  These guys don't even fucking drive the boat.  I had a hanging out eating and fucking hanging out with you.  I had dinner at the captain's table once.  It was very amazing.  What would that guy have been the last guy on the boat?  And be honest, I felt really odd because he was goofy. 
[01:26:30]  He's trying to make jokes at the table.  And I'm like, oh, God, this is the captain of the fucking.  Oh, really?  I think there's probably 20 other people that can fucking sail that ship with no problems.  I would guess nine out of 10 of those dummies are leaving the fucking ship.  Figurehead?  They're leaving.  They're just jumping?  They're saving their own life.  Oh, no.  They know they got families at home and stuff.  But it's so ingrained.  Like even in Italy, there's like a 14 year jail sentence if you leave the ship.  Yeah, that's better than being dead.  They're pretty fucking strict with their maritime law. 
[01:27:00]  Titanic, anyone?  He didn't do that guy any yet.  He didn't have anywhere to go, did he?  What a coward, though.  Don't you want to believe, though, that there are real men in real positions?  Yeah.  Like on the plane or on the boat or taking care of shit?  Yes, I would like to think that.  But I really think it goes the other way.  Most guys would say, fuck this.  I know what I signed up for.  Most guys are not the captain of a vessel.  You wouldn't get through, you and I would have been like, show, let's be captains. 
[01:27:30]  This will be cool.  This will be cool.  This will be cool.  If you want.  If you want.  And then the first day they would tell us, all right, you got to run five miles.  And then we're going to talk about going down with the ship.  Sure.  And the next day you and I would be like, dude, I can't make it.  I'm not going in.  Me neither.  I'm not going to do it either.  Oh, no.  We would have bailed.  We wouldn't have gone through the whole thing.  No, I would just make believe I'm that guy.  You would go.  And then when that ship is tilting, I'm going to cover my ass before I fucking jump for it. 
[01:28:00]  At least you got the beard for it, Captain Smith.  Look at you.  Yeah.  You're like the fucking captain of the Titanic.  You're doing a captain beard there.  It's pretty good.  It's true.  You look like the guy that would stay on that ship no matter what.  I would like to believe that most of these guys would do the right thing and try to be  the last guy out.  But I'm telling you, man, human nature takes over.  You got kids at home, maybe a loved one.  And you're like, fuck this.  I got to save my own life.  You know what you actually look?  I didn't even notice this.  No, you look like a Nazi U-boat commander. 
[01:28:30]  Definitely.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah, you're like Das Boot.  No, I don't.  Das Boot.  That was cool.  Dude, it's a cruise ship, too, man.  You're not talking about some army guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  The army guys, I believe, absolutely, they sign up for something and they're all in.  That's a good point.  Not a guy driving.  Like a Navy commander of a vessel.  Steering a fucking cruise ship?  Come on.  You're Italian.  You're going to be on a cruise ship.  You know it's just to get laid.  And you sign up going, well, what are the odds that I have to be the last guy off this  thing?  Sure, I'll check yes. 
[01:29:00]  Captain Quig.  Strawberries.  Right.  Strawberries.  But if you're going into the military, they're making fucking sure you're going to do your job  properly.  I think it's different.  Yeah.  I really do.  How many portions of cannolis did you have?  You look so beautiful.  Welcome to my boat.  Hey, welcome, man.  Hey.  Hey, everybody's having a good time under the boat.  Oh, my shoes are getting wet.  I'm going to get the fuck out of here.  How about Fandu?  Well, this Italian captain, though, what a piece of shit. 
[01:29:30]  No matter what.  No matter what, he is a piece of shit.  He abandoned ship.  He left everybody on their own devices.  It would have been better.  But now his excuses are ridiculous.  Yeah.  It would have been better if he finally said, look, I abandoned ship.  Yeah.  I got scared.  And yeah, I didn't do the right thing.  But now he's trying to cover his ass.  Now he's saying that he's not good at it.  And then he fell off the boat into a lifeboat.  Into a lifeboat.  But he tripped into the lifeboat that had his senior staff.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All his senior staff.  So all the main guys were all in this one lifeboat. 
[01:30:00]  And he just happened to trip into that same boat.  So wait, he's walking down the outside of the ship by the rail.  Right.  And I guess an ottoman was there.  What happened?  A banana peel.  Oh, gee.  Here comes the captain.  Oh, no.  What?  What?  Oh, shit.  Oh, mama mia.  Who would put it on ottoman in there?  Right over the rail.  Boom, boom, boom.  And I got the two bottles of wine. 
[01:30:30]  How did that happen?  Quick, make a foot of the island.  What an asshole.  Oh, man.  Do you think Captain Stubing would have gone down with the ship?  Oh, yeah.  No.  Stubing was one.  Oh, he was a good one.  I'm getting.  Look.  Him and all the bad stars from the 70s.  Fucking the guy that played Grizzly Adams.  The entire cast of eight is enough.  Can you not take Grizzly Adams?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  The Duke's a hazard guy.  Tom Wopat.  Right.  Is in love with fucking the chick from Three's Company. 
[01:31:00]  Ron's not listening closely.  So, I want to give him a second on the air.  Ron, go ahead, sir.  All right.  Hello.  Hi, sir.  You're on the air.  I didn't know if you guys have picked up yet.  Yeah.  It's all my opi's logic, though.  Saying firemen would never run into a building.  Cops would never stop a crime.  Because they'd be running the other direction.  Like I said, you're not listening.  I said military guys, and sure, I would put policemen and firemen in that same category.  They're trained in such a way that you absolutely know they would do the right thing under some stressful circumstances. 
[01:31:30]  But I think the captains are supposed to be trained like that, too.  I don't think they are.  I don't think the captain of a cruise ship is that same mindset.  That's all I'm saying.  I think for the most part they are.  But you're going to get the exceptions.  And this guy was an exception.  He was an exception to the rule.  I think the rule is they will stay there.  But you're sailing a city.  Thousands of people.  Right, right.  It's like if you were the captain of Manhattan.  You should have some courage.  Exactly. 
[01:32:00]  A little bit of stick to it.  My theory might have some holes in it.  But I will say this.  Firemen and policemen, I have no doubt.  In my mind, in general, overwhelming majority would do the right thing in a stressful situation.  So why aren't you putting a cruise ship captain, why aren't you giving them the same kind of respect that they would do the same thing, too?  Because their job's easy.  Is it?  Yes.  There's a lot of responsibility.  What's the responsibility?  They're responsible for 4,000 lives on those ships.  No.  The only reason this happened. 
[01:32:30]  It all comes down to them.  The only reason this happened was because he was showing off.  If you just do your.  Right.  If you just do your I'm steering the fucking cruise ship job, you're never going to get into a situation like this.  Well, that's true.  How was he showing off?  How was he showing off?  He wanted to try to get too close.  I guess over the years, they kind of like to scrape the coast.  They go close to this one island and show off.  And I guess, what, the captain wanted to wave to his own family?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  Maybe that was it.  No, that's what I'm hearing.  Yeah, he was waving to somebody.  I guess his family was on shore and he was like, hey, I'll be home soon. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, man.  And, ooh, there's a rock.  Oh, yeah.  But they're saying.  It was a horrible sound.  What is it that?  Oh, God.  I'm not on.  Run for your lives.  All right, quick.  Someone pushed me over the rail.  I tripped.  Tripped into a lifeboat.  Whoopsie daisy.  Oh, what a jackass.  Wow.  Yeah, that's a lame-ass excuse.  Now you've got to just fess up and go, look, I was fucking scared.  Because now you're looking even stupider. 
[01:33:30]  It's amazing how huge it is, though.  It's so huge.  You see the satellite image?  It looks weird.  Yeah, yeah.  The pictures from space?  Yeah.  Fuck, that's a big boat.  That's big.  Is it one of the biggest boats in?  No, that actually isn't even one of the biggest boats.  Wow.  It's fucked up.  That one, though, a lot of these cruise ships, they're as big as the World Trade Center was standing up.  If you stand that cruise ship up, it's literally a skyscraper, but laying down and floating on the water. 
[01:34:00]  You like cruises?  Yeah, I have fun on those goddamn things.  There's casinos on board, a lot of bars and restaurants and stuff, and then you go on the little excursions during the day,  so you're in a different place, do some ATV ride in the jungle, and then you're on a beach the next day.  Right.  So it's just a lot of fucking cool stuff, yeah.  I like it also because I seem to do pretty good for myself, and I get the nice suites on the ship.  Oh, nice.  Yes.  If my room was on that ship that tipped over, I literally could have stepped from the balcony rail as it tipped over. 
[01:34:30]  It's a hotel room.  Right onto the island.  It's a hotel room.  I'd just been like, thank you, my bags.  Right, right.  They're right there.  You would have been Marky Mark on that.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd have fucking jumped off my balcony, I'd have been on the island, and I'd have been rocking that place.  Ooh, ooh, good vibes, yeah.  That's what I'm talking.  Yeah.  No one would have died.  I'd have went back in.  I'd have put a piece of bamboo in my mouth to breathe. 
[01:35:00]  You would have walked right into a hotel suite.  Yeah.  Whenever I hear about cruises, it's from other comedians who, it's a horrible experience.  Oh.  Yeah, I gotta say, for the crew and for the entertainment, especially comics, I've seen some cruise comics, and they're just, and it's such a stereotype.  Oh, cruise comic.  They stink.  Right.  They really aren't that good.  Yeah.  And I usually go just to, you know, to laugh, and not at, I mean, at them.  You sit there and you just go, oh, they can't be dirty. 
[01:35:30]  They can't be edgy.  It's a lot of cruise-related jokes.  Yeah.  How much could you joke about the old buffet?  And how many times do we have to use that hand sanitizer, people?  Am I right?  Am I right?  Oh, God.  I hope he hit a rock.  There was a comedian who got on a boat, and he had, they, an incident had happened with the entertainment before.  An incident?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So they didn't want, so they weren't allowed up on deck.  Oh, shit.  So they, like, part of the crew, had to stay in their rooms or below. 
[01:36:00]  In steerage.  And he literally had a room, like, in the back of the stage.  Oh, shit.  And he sat down there for days.  The Phantom of the Opera?  And then they opened the door to his room on show night.  They opened the door to his room and the door to the stage.  He walks out on stage, does his show like a gerbil, and then goes back into his room.  Man, the other guy must have really fucked up.  They're just letting him out of their box to entertain him.  Back in the fucking box.  I would assume if you're on a cruise ship and you don't know the name of the comedian, he's going to be horrendous. 
[01:36:30]  It's terrible.  And there was another thing, like, and this is even worse.  The last ship I was on, there was an improv place.  Like, go down, and you just see people sitting there.  Just like Second City.  And I would walk by, yeah.  Second City on the sea.  Oh, yeah.  I would walk by and just hear these little glimmers of what's going on in the room and be like, there's no way I will ever be in there.  If this ship sunk and that was the only air pocket, I still would not go in there. 
[01:37:00]  You're like, so, uh, I need an occupation.  All right.  All right.  People in the audience.  Crappy improv comic.  Go.  Put on this captain's hat.  Yeah, they're all dressed like the captain and crew and some old bag laughing.  Can I talk to John?  I'm getting killed because of my theory that I don't, I think most captains would just say, fuck it.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, Owen.  Hey, John.  Hey, John.  Hey, John.  Hey, John.  Um, I would hate to have Opie on that emergency row on an airplane. 
[01:37:30]  Why, man?  I'd be out of everyone's way.  No.  What are you talking about?  I would fucking rip that door and be the first one out.  Dude, Opie's right.  What I want that guy to do is open the fucking window and get the fuck out of the way.  Clear the way, motherfucker, because I'm coming next.  You know, most people die in a plane because fucking fatties get in the way.  And they can't move properly.  I think it's because you're pulverized on impact.  But that's probably the second reason, Opie.  Good point.  Good point.  Good point. 
[01:38:00]  But if you have to get off a plane quickly, I'm your man.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Your theory sucks.  No, you'd pull the door off and throw it right on me and I'd get you.  Oh, that's the one you think I'd throw it behind me.  Yeah, you're supposed to throw it out of the plane.  Opie, you'd throw it behind him.  It's hitting some mom in the head.  Hold this.  Yeah, hold this.  Look, I know.  It's a child.  Look, I know my theory makes me look like an asshole.  But, I mean, the George Costanza thing.  Yeah.  The famous George Costanza thing.  Where he runs out of the party because there's a fire.  And he's knocking over a grandmother with a walker. 
[01:38:30]  It's fucking great.  We all have our fucking limit where we would all do that.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  And, you know, it's not like it's without example.  Right.  This guy jumped off the ship.  Right.  Right.  And it was just tilted.  Right.  Exactly.  It was just tilted.  It didn't even sink.  Didn't even sink.  And you know that ship better than anybody.  You could have gone in there and really helped some people out.  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, he said before he tripped that he gave his own life jacket away to somebody. 
[01:39:00]  Because it didn't look as good.  Yeah.  I don't want to cover up my captain.  Why am I talking like that?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  Am I a captain?  It was on a rock.  It would hit bottom.  Right.  You just didn't want the hassle.  Yeah.  You know what?  There's the pictures of it right there.  That just looks fucked up when you see something that huge in a position it's not supposed  to be in.  Well, I mean, half of it is underwater.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, if you're on that part. 
[01:39:30]  I would love to go inside that ship now, though.  Mystery woman on board.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Spotted with the ship's captain.  Oh, no!  That's why he ran.  A new twist to the story.  He didn't want to get busted by his wife because he had his girlfriend on the boat with him.  Oh, no.  You think he was showing off to her?  Like, look what I could do.  Hey, where's my guma?  I need my guma.  I know you've watched me for eight hours and I haven't done anything as the captain of  the ship, but watch what I do now.  The real question is what was she doing to him at the time when he was supposed to be 
[01:40:00]  steering?  You have to get us off of this boat.  You're coming with me.  I get us off of right now.  Oh, man.  Getting off is exactly what he was doing.  Yes.  Wait, a mystery girl, they're saying.  Oh, boy.  Oh, brother.  The Italians.  Yep.  Right?  The Italians.  It's all about amore.  Look how big it is.  Look how that boat with those human beings on it.  I know.  Look like ants next to it.  Yeah, that's the satellite picture.  Look at the satellite photo.  That's fucked up right there. 
[01:40:30]  Most people have seen this by now.  Man, oh, man.  That's funny.  That's taken from outer space.  That's unbelievable.  That's fucked up right there, man.  What a coward.  Yeah, look how close it is to the island, though.  It's like, oh, it's a little jaunt.  So he's cheating on his wife.  He's got his girlfriend on the boat.  Oh, we don't know.  He's cheating on his wife.  I'm saying it.  Okay, fair enough.  He can't sue.  Fair enough.  He's in Italy in jail.  We're the least of his problems.  I think some fucking DJs from, yeah, the United States, ragging him.  I doubt this even gets back to him. 
[01:41:00]  Mamma mia, now we really have trouble, Capitan.  Opie and Anthony, they are saying you are cheating on your wife.  Cheating on my wife.  Now I'm a man.  Those are two in New York City.  Getting me a plane ticket.  Fly it over New York and put an item in there so I can trip out of the plane and land in the studio.  I am a pissed off.  I'm a buff a ghoul, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:41:30]  I am going to kill this Opie and Anthony.  Biting my hand like my mom used to do when she was mad.  Really?  Busting apart those stereotypes, aren't you?  Why you?  Mamma mia.  So, he has his girlfriend.  And he's showing off for his girlfriend.  Yeah.  He says, watch, I'm going to scrape this fucking island, man.  Who hasn't had a chick in the car and done some fucking 360s in the snow with a parking lot?  And you hit a curb or a pole in the parking lot. 
[01:42:00]  I know it's on a little bit of a bigger scale.  Oh, don't do it.  You're scaring me.  Look, I'm real closer to this rock.  No, don't.  Mamma mia, we're going to hit it if you don't suck on my dick.  All right, all right.  I'm going to blame the whole thing on his wife.  On his wife.  His wife's calling.  I'm going, look, I know you're on that ship with your girl.  You proved to me you're not.  No.  And he goes, well, I'm going to do a float by.  I'm going to wave to you.  I've come real close.  I'm going to come real close. 
[01:42:30]  And you can see for yourself there's no girl here.  The story's going to get better.  I assure you.  I assure you.  This story's going to get a lot better.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  We're all in on this one.  I can't wait to the snapshot from someone's cell phone from the night before.  He's on the dance floor with this girl.  Captain hat on backwards.  Button down.  His chest hair sticking out.  She has his hat on.  She's got the hat on.  She's wearing it.  Tilted.  Tilted.  She's got it on.  The blouse undone. 
[01:43:00]  Just drinks in both hands.  He's double fisting.  He's going under the limbo stick.  Hey.  What's that noise?  Oh, my God.  This guy's in trouble.  He is truly fucked.  You know, it's a story we've told a bunch of times, but I don't know if Tom has ever heard it.  We understand, me and Ant, that some of these boat captains can be very irresponsible.  There was a little trip me and Ant took back in the day with our girls to Turks and Caicos. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, I was there.  Yeah, that's nice, right?  A little club bed.  And then we went on one of those booze cruise.  Booze cruise.  Booze cruise extravaganza.  Booze cruises.  All of a sudden, we're on a deserted beach with kegs and keg stands, and everyone had to get really fucked up.  Oh, no.  And it was all a lot of fun.  And then on the way back, we noticed the captain is driving really slow, and there was a thunderstorm that was basically chasing the boat.  So we're all like, holy fuck, why is he fucking driving so slow? 
[01:44:00]  Turns out, a girl that we saw get on the plane to Turks and Caicos by making out with her boyfriend, like, I'm going to meet you so much.  It's going to be a long week.  Oh, really?  Is now with the fucking captain.  No.  And might have been blowing him.  Oh, on the boat?  On the boat, as we're all just wasted, like, ah.  Could have been.  Oh, no.  And you see the thunderclouds.  Fuck it.  The sky's getting darker and darker, and the boat is slowing down because he's having a good old time. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Speed it up, motherfucker.  And then that same girl, we land in JFK, and she runs right into the arms of her boyfriend.  Baby.  And we're just like, oh.  Oh, man.  You blew the booze cruise guy.  You blew the booze cruise captain.  Remember that, though, eh?  Oh, hell yeah.  Guys looking around the boat like, look what's going on.  He wasn't even hiding.  He wasn't.  No.  He was so into it.  Maybe.  The booze cruise is crazy, man. 
[01:45:00]  There's something about boats where girls lose their minds when they get near a boat.  Yeah, it's the boat and the alcohol that goes along with boating.  Boating is boring if you're not drinking.  It's really true.  Because for the most part, every boat I've been out on with friends and family and things like that, you're really not boating.  No.  You're tied up somewhere, just kind of bobbing around a little bit.  Right.  You're like a court.  And you're drinking.  If you don't drink, what are you going to do?  Right.  There's nothing else to do.  No.  You're going to realize this sucks. 
[01:45:30]  This kind of sucks.  And we've got another theory coming in.  Uh-oh.  Matt, how's the theory?  Yeah, I think he might have been looking at the moon and it hit him in the eye.  Like a great big pizza pie?  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Okay.  Look.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, I'm not up on my 50-year-old fucking Dino Loves on ship was a tragedy.  A disaster.  When the moon hits your eye like a bigger pizza pie. 
[01:46:00]  That's the money.  Let's crash the boat.  Yeah.  That's the money.  I'm going to get out of here.  Whoopsie-dick.  And get it to the island.  And a step on it.  Whoopsie-dick.  Oh, here comes my first mate.  Oh, he'll fall too.  Hey, everybody.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  The purser. 
[01:46:30]  The cruise director.  There's the captain.  There's the co-host.  There's the pilot's boat driver.  And everybody, this is my co-host.  Hey, take us into the island.  I think that's everybody.  I searched Twitter for a long time until I finally found someone that agreed with me.  Ed Paramedic.  Oh, you're exactly right.  The cruise ship captains are nothing more than glorified tour bus drivers. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  Nine out of ten would bail.  Well, I've heard airline pilots are nothing but glorified bus drivers.  So that's kind of, you know, I don't take his word.  Yeah, but you can't fucking bail from a plane, really.  Well.  You're all in there.  Was this a good cruise line?  Yeah, I guess so.  It's a, it's a, the parent company is Carnival, but it's, it's run strictly out of Italy by  itself.  So I don't know how much Carnival has to do with it, but Carnival is even, as far as a  cruise line that people in the States go on, um, eh. 
[01:47:30]  Nice.  So.  It's no Norwegian.  No, no, Norwegian's really good.  Right.  That's, that's good.  I like that.  I like, um, uh, what's the other one that you go on there, Iraq?  Royal Caribbean.  Yeah, Royal Caribbean's a good one, too.  Oh, yeah.  That's, uh, yeah.  Yeah, and then they got these other ones, like, and, and all of them, and here's, I was  listening last night, uh, to some news, and they, they said, uh, that these people don't  even have a claim.  Like, the people can't, they, they get $150 for whatever shit is lost on the ship.  No.  That's it.  And they can't sue. 
[01:48:00]  They can't sue.  So, that your ticket is your contract, and you sign your fucking life away when you go  on these cruises, and you don't even have any recourse as an American in America to take  it to an American court, because it's a foreign-flagged ship, and there's nothing you can do about  it.  And, and when you go on Carnival or any of these other cruise lines, Royal Caribbean,  Norwegian, uh, they're all foreign-flagged ships also.  So, you really don't have any recourse with them either.  Oh, boy.  Uh, there isn't an American-flagged cruise company anymore. 
[01:48:30]  Uh.  They don't exist.  Who's going to get all their shit?  Uh, probably a salvage company.  Wow.  I would gather.  Imagine you're a diver, and you get to go in and out of all these fucking rooms.  Gold.  Oh, shit.  But then that head pops up, like, in Jaws.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Ben Gardner pokes his face out, like, with a fucking, yeah, with a lay around his neck  or some fucking Hawaiian shirt on.  You drop all the jewels you just found.  I hate boats. 
[01:49:00]  I really hate boats.  That would be cool as hell.  I don't like boats.  Oh.  I like a good ship.  I don't mind the cruise lines.  They're just...  I've never done it.  I've never been on one.  Especially around the Caribbean.  Like, this Mediterranean shit, bah, I don't know about that.  I don't know.  Some Somali come up and grab you.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't fucking know.  But the cruise ships around the Caribbean and stuff, they just seem very fun.  Does it feel like you're on a boat?  Does it wobble like you're on a boat?  Only in pretty extreme waves.  Yeah.  In normal weather, you really don't feel it. 
[01:49:30]  Right.  A couple of times, you'll kind of be sitting there and go, like, whoa, I think something  moved.  But, like, I've gotten seasick my entire life, and I haven't gotten sick on a ship, a cruise  ship.  Really?  So, yeah.  What it's worth.  Makes me nauseous.  Jerry Springer's here, so we should break.  Oh, Jerry.  Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.  Tom Papa in studio this Friday and Saturday at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights.  Go see Tom Papa.  Bananas.  And then Tom Papa Live in New York City, available now on iTunes.  Bananas.  Exactly. 
[01:50:00]  I hear there's a lot of bananas on the stage or something.  Yeah, they blow up.  I've never been there.  They actually blow up bananas, and there's some actual real bananas.  Beautiful.  It's a, you know, it's one of those places where everybody's played there.  It's a great club.  Like, they do great shows.  It's like, why do you need the bananas on the stage?  You don't have to do that anymore.  You don't really need that anymore.  You've established yourself.  I grew up in New Jersey, so there's a lot of people I know that come to that show, and  it's just like, why is it?  We thought you had a TV show.  Why are you up there?  Oh, sir.  Why are you up there?  With a rubber, with a plastic banana. 
[01:50:30]  But it is a great club.  But let me reiterate.  Let me just reiterate how great it is.  It's their thing.  It's bananas.  We got a banana theme.  It's bananas.  I'm telling my kids, where are you going?  Dad, we want you to stay home tonight.  Where are you going?  I'm sorry.  I've got to go.  Where?  To bananas.  You really don't love us.  Masculating, too, as a dad.  It's just like, you know, go to the office. 
[01:51:00]  I've got to go to work.  Yeah.  To bananas.  Bananas.  There's a problem there only I can solve.  Bananas.  There's some inflatable fruit that needs someone to tell jokes in front of it.  That's me.  That is me.  Cruiseship is valued at a half billion dollars.  Wow.  Half billion dollars.  Wow, wow, wow.  Damn, wow.  All right.  Dad, Zooks.  Jerry Springer next.  Seriously, XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:51:30]  We've got to get Jerry Springer in here.  Jerry.  He's a big star.  Jerry.  Big star.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  Jerry.  There he is.  All right.  Hey, Jerry Springer.  Always looks good.  How are you, Jerry?  Hey, Jerry.  Pleasure.  How are you?  There he is.  That's Sam Roberts.  How are you, Jerry?  He's on the shit show.  Well, thank you.  Jerry always looks like a gentleman.  We saw you pacing out there.  We're like, oh, boy. 
[01:52:00]  We've got to get Jerry Springer in here.  Oh, no, no, no.  He's going to crack some skulls.  It's just going over my bank account.  Oh, yeah.  Those headphones got to kind of go down like, there you go.  There you go.  What's wrong with the bank account?  Probably nothing.  Oh, no.  Nothing.  It's kidding.  It's nice.  It's great.  It's very good.  Jesus.  I would like Jerry Springer's bank account.  I never know where to put the decimal.  Yeah.  It's so difficult.  You know Tom Papa?  No, we haven't met.  He's a comedian.  He was here last time.  And friends with Jerry Seinfeld.  He likes to downplay it, but he's good friends with Jerry Seinfeld. 
[01:52:30]  It's the other Jerry.  Well, that's the best in the business.  And Clint Eastwood?  Yeah.  Clint's a good friend.  Clint Eastwood?  Okay.  I know.  That's pretty good.  Now Jerry Seinfeld.  Yeah.  That's a good friend.  Yeah.  That's what happens to him.  He's blown us off.  You know, I hosted that Marriage Riff show for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't get that show to go as long as it's your stuff.  Yes, absolutely.  I do remember that.  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  How long has your show been?  20?  21 years.  God.  21 years.  You should have stopped at 20.  No excuse for it.  Man.  No.  Why don't you stop at 20? 
[01:53:00]  You should have stopped at 20.  20's a nice number.  Why stop?  I'm going to stop at 40.  40?  Call me just before we hit 40.  Yeah.  So that I remember.  Because I don't want to then have to go six times.  No, but do you think that you could create another show that would have that kind of staying power?  No.  No.  No.  The times are different.  No.  Yeah.  No.  He established himself.  Yeah.  You've got to be locked in.  He strikes once and there you are.  But now you've got to make it to 25.  That's the problem.  That's what I'm getting at.  What?  That's the problem.  Well, I didn't.  You either stop at 20 or go, all right, I'm going to 25. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  That doesn't mean anything.  You can't stop at 21 or 22.  Yeah.  You don't even get a gold watch if you don't.  But I'm trying to because I did a knee bend yesterday, so I'm really getting in shape.  Oh, you did?  Oh, congratulations.  Nice to hear you're working on yourself.  Yeah.  That's good, Jerry.  My age, that's all that happens.  So what are you doing these days besides the show?  Anything?  You got any side deals going?  I know you're always working.  Yeah, well, I'm a vendor now.  A vendor?  Yeah.  You're out on the sidewalk, so. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, I'm doing.  That would be interesting.  Jerry, a hot dog?  Yeah.  Have a hot dog, Jerry?  He's a quesadilla guy, I think.  Yeah.  Quesadilla.  Well, actually, I did that, what was that show called, I Get That All the Time, the TV show  where they have, you know, apparently well-known people or whatever being in different situations  and then they say, hey, wait a second, aren't you Jerry Spinelli?  I get that all the time, yeah.  Yeah, you kind of fake them out.  So I was working in a delicatessen.  Oh.  Yeah.  It was just a lot of fun to do.  That's funny. 
[01:54:30]  That's a stress for Jerry.  Because, you know, I would put all these sandwiches together, you know, stretch for me.  Why would they think me in a delicatessen?  Hey, Selma, how you doing?  Great.  You know what's great?  You said, and it was a lot of fun.  There's someone working in a deli right now looking at their ear going, no, it's not a  lot of fun.  It's fun for Jerry one day.  Well, once I put the sandwiches together, then I would, before handing it to them, I  would take a bite to see if it was good.  Oh.  See, they probably didn't like that.  No, and they're looking, and they're just saying, what the?  But I'm Jerry.  Yeah.  I smell like olive oil. 
[01:55:00]  So now you've got, obviously, the show.  So I do that, once in a while I do, and then I've also been out in Vegas doing The Price  Is Right at Valleys.  That's the biggest show of that.  And then I do America's Got Talent, the road show.  The road show.  I like America's Got Talent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love that.  So, yeah, I'm staying busy.  And I'm doing a lot of political stuff now.  Right.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  Oh, don't.  He's so hardcore.  Here we go.  Here we go.  He is so hardcore right conservative.  It really affects me saying. 
[01:55:30]  Are you enjoying South Carolina, watching some of the stuff coming out of there?  Yeah.  I'm really enjoying it.  Of course, I'm not for any of them.  Yeah.  But, no, yeah, yeah.  I enjoy that.  You've got to respect Newt for what he's doing.  He's just fucking it all up.  He refuses to get out of the way.  Honestly.  I mean, we've got to respect that, at least.  Yeah.  If you're Obama, you do not have to write any commercials.  It's all done.  Just play replay notes.  All you've got to do is buy the rights to his commercials and run them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I assume it's going to be Romney, and then all he has to do is...  But don't you think that the conservatives not being happy with Romney because he's 
[01:56:00]  not...  He's so far from the extreme right.  From what they want, yes.  Don't you think that's going to hurt Obama because he's going to capture the middle in  the regular election?  Here's what I think will happen.  If Romney is elected president, which I don't think will happen, but anyway, if by some  chance he's elected president, that the right wing or the conservatives in America will  be out of power for about 12 to 16 years.  They'll have no place to go. 
[01:56:30]  Right.  Because if Romney wins, then the Tea Party and the right wing, they're out.  They obviously won't go to the Democratic Party.  Right.  They're out in the Republican Party.  Romney will run for re-election four years later, so he'll be in charge of the party.  And then after eight years of Republican rule, then the country goes back Democrat.  So really, this is panic time for the conservatives.  They have to make sure Romney's not the candidate because if he's the candidate, they're out of  business.  They have no place to go.  They're not going to go with Ron Paul because they don't agree with him on foreign policy. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  So they are really out of business for 12, 16 years.  So it's serious time for them.  That's why Gingrich and these guys are going crazy after Romney.  They realize this is their last stand.  But screw what's best for the right or the left, the conservatives or liberals.  What's best for the country?  Obama.  Doesn't it seem like a liberal, a more liberal Republican would be better?  Obama's too far to the left.  Well, I would say, good Lord, he's not.  That's why the left is unhappy with him.  There is nothing very left about him. 
[01:57:30]  I mean, he is so middle of the road, Obama, I would argue.  I would.  Yeah.  Why?  What parts are for you or to left?  Well, I think his social programs, a lot of them are just concentrate on the extreme downtrodden and the poor.  Not a bad thing.  I'm not saying it's bad, ethically speaking.  But he's the most middle class president there is.  I mean, look what he's doing.  He was saying we have to have the payroll tax cuts.  We have to make them, you know, because that's most Americans, by the way, pay more in their payroll tax than they do in their income tax. 
[01:58:00]  So you got to stay.  So that's a middle class tax.  So he's for it.  And the Republicans come back and say, no, we're not going to give the tax cut on the payroll tax cut unless the top 3 percent.  You give the top 3 percent in America a tax cut as well.  Really?  You're going to hold the whole country hostage just because you want to take care of the top 3 percent?  That doesn't make any sense.  I understand.  Just like Obama's pretty much holding the country hostage as far as energy goes with the Keystone Project because he doesn't want to make a decision before the election. 
[01:58:30]  Well, he also tagged on a lot of other terms.  Obama's a pro at that, too.  What he has said is we probably will do the Keystone Project, but they have to find there's one part of the project, as it now stands, that goes over an aquifer, over a water source.  Don't come out of my faucet.  Okay, right.  So they want to make sure that they don't have leaks. 
[01:59:00]  They don't want to run the pipes over where people get their drinking water.  So they have to shift it a little bit.  That is going to take more time.  That's going to probably take six months, a year more to get the rights to that.  Right, exactly after the election.  But he says we're going to do it, but we're not going to run the pipe over where the water is.  The Republicans said you have to make a decision by the 21st of this month, knowing full well that that would force him to lose votes either way, whichever decision he made.  So he made the decision we're going to save the water supply. 
[01:59:30]  We're still going to get the pipeline.  We're still going to get it.  The Canadians came back and said we're still going to do it.  We're not going to take our oil elsewhere.  We're going to do it, but it'll be about a year or two later.  But we're still going to do it.  You don't think this is a guy to appease environmentalists?  And you don't see Obama doing the same thing.  If he was purely playing politics, he would not have made this decision.  Because right now with the economy where it is, believe me, the easier political decision would be this gets jobs instantly. 
[02:00:00]  We're going to do the pipe to hell with the environmentalists.  Do you think this guy really wants right now a lot of the unemployment rate  and the fact that he's giving out, doling out extensions on unemployment  and really, you know, helping the unemployed, that's fine.  Doling out?  You don't think.  That's such a negative term.  Exactly.  You don't think.  Believe me, if you were out of a job and trying to support a family  and you were laid off through no fault of your own, but you've been laid off,  you're trying to support your family, get your kids through school, whatever it is, 
[02:00:30]  pay their medical bills and all that,  and while you're looking for a job or hoping that jobs become available,  you're getting your unemployment insurance, which you put money into every month,  every week with your paycheck, you would not consider that a dole.  Well, the extensions are pretty extreme.  Yes, we're in a recession.  I understand.  But you know what?  Also, he knows those people are voting for him.  It's almost in his best interest to keep them on the dole. 
[02:01:00]  Well, God forbid we should have a politician that does things that the people want.  Not all the people, that's for sure.  Not a majority of the people.  I have no problem being as lucky as I am in life  if that some of my tax dollars go to help people when they're in time of year.  Well, Jerry, you know you're not paying enough taxes.  You know you're not.  We all aren't.  We've got to pay more and do our part, or else we're not patriotic.  Those of us who are wealthier probably do, yeah,  because we get the best benefits out of society.  Yeah, we should pay more.  No, I don't think so.  Wait, does it drive you nuts to write those big checks? 
[02:01:30]  No.  Those taxes?  No.  No, I'm thinking, this is God's truth.  I'm looking, I'm saying, oh my God, what a life I have.  I am being paid to do something that is pure fun,  and I'm living in the greatest country in the world,  greatest opportunities, all that kind of stuff,  and I'm saying, if I've got to pay a little bit more, why not?  It's easy for you to say, you've got a lot of money, and you're at the end of your life.  For the love of God, I'm still sitting here with this and vinegar.  I want to spend.  I feel like I'm at the end of my life. 
[02:02:00]  Jerry's going to outlive all of us.  We all know that.  Look at this guy.  We all know that.  No, it's, uh...  I think he's like 80-something.  He looks like he's 60.  Oh, this is true.  God's truth.  Last week, we're taping a show, and we had a dominatrix on.  Okay, good.  Now we can talk about stuff.  He is the luckiest man on earth.  Yeah.  Hey, over-dominatrix, I'll pay more days.  Okay.  Now he makes a good point.  So this guy is on stage, and he's on his hands and knees, and she's whipping him. 
[02:02:30]  And she says, I'm going to give you a quiz, and every time you're wrong, I'm going to whip you, etc.  So the first question, silly stuff, how long did Jerry Springer show been on the air?  He says, 15 years.  You're wrong.  Whip, whip, whip, whip.  Okay, next question.  This is God's truth.  We had no idea what she was going to ask.  She says, how old is Jerry Springer?  And you go, I don't know.  And she whipped him.  Ow, ow, 89.  89.  I swear to God.  89. 
[02:03:00]  What?  You start whipping her.  I mean, okay.  70, 75, 89.  Are we allowed to ask your age, Jerry?  Yeah, I'm 68.  There you go.  Nice.  Wow.  God, what do you do right?  You think I'd make it?  What do you do right, though?  I don't do anything right.  Do you work out, anything?  No.  Smoothies?  What do you got?  Solids?  No.  Nothing.  No, I'm very unhealthy.  I mean, I don't.  I'm very unhealthy.  I'm proud to say I'm very unhealthy.  No, but I mean, I don't eat any of the right things. 
[02:03:30]  I really, I don't exercise.  You know what?  Stick with it.  You know, I mean, I don't exercise.  You got good genes.  Yeah, stick with it then.  Yeah, skinny.  Yeah, I've been lucky.  Yeah.  What else are you doing as far as you say you're getting involved more politically?  What are you actually doing besides just coming on radio shows and blurting out things  for the left?  Well, there are only four of us left in the country.  Give us a little.  When's your gig on MSNBC then?  Yeah, yeah.  That's the day the ones be eating a pie.  And certainly Fox's objective. 
[02:04:00]  You were on with Sean Hannity last night.  Yeah, that's difficult because they, and you know what I mean by that is because, and  it's, you go on and, which is fair.  That's their show.  That was brave of you.  Yeah, but they, they, it's not you just talking with Sean.  It's you got people on both sides and you're obviously very right wing, which is fine.  And they're just screaming and yelling at you the whole time.  You don't get a sentence out.  Sounds like the Jerry Springer show.  Now you know how it feels.  Yeah, why would anyone go on my show? 
[02:04:30]  Exactly.  Now you understand.  This would be a fine time for me to say I'll be on Fox Red Eye.  Yes, I can't wait to see it.  Was Sean Hannity hitting you with that whip when you were getting all the questions wrong?  That was the good part.  Oh my God.  I tried to be wrong.  You know, are you bored with the Jerry Springer show?  No.  We're bored with radio.  Well, here's the thing.  Haven't you done everything though?  Here's the thing.  How do you make it interesting after all these years?  Well, first of all, it is total fun because, first of all, it's just two days a week. 
[02:05:00]  I do three shows on Monday, two on Tuesday.  Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.  I know.  We've got to cut it down.  So it's a lot different.  We're cutting down our shows.  Yeah.  Next contract.  And secondly, the people.  Yeah.  That's right, Tom.  Yeah.  And secondly, well, there they go.  They go, don't leave.  Well, welcome to the Jerry Springer show.  I'm here alone now.  So no, they, and the people are fascinating.  I mean, they really are. 
[02:05:30]  You're just meeting these people with incredible stories and it's funny and it's whatever.  And so, you know, that's not difficult.  It's just amazing that you can still get people with stories that, that want to be on the show  and, and, you know, have a new angle or something.  It's just because it's been so many years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I think, and this is a, this is a straight answer.  I think the real reason is we've been around so long.  We're starting literally to get the next generation of kids.  Oh my God.  Because, you know, we are, I mean, the college kids that have come to the show, this is, 
[02:06:00]  you know, they've heard it their whole lives.  Their parents have been talking about it.  They were, you know, and now all of a sudden they're old enough to come to see the show  or to start watching the show, the giggle factor, all that.  If you have a show, I think we may have talked about this before, but if you have a show  that aims at young people, you can be on forever because there are always new  young people.  You have a show that aims at 35, 40 year olds.  After a while, they will get tired because your interests don't change between 30 and  50.  Right.  But with young kids, you always have new ones. 
[02:06:30]  So you always have a new audience.  But don't you always have new 30 year olds too?  Yeah, but, well, you do, but once you hit 25, your interests are pretty much the same  for the next 15, 20 years.  That's what I'm saying.  Right, right, right.  But going from the age of 10 to 20, that's all of a sudden.  It's my dating range.  All of a sudden, yeah.  No, I, all of a sudden you're old enough to start watching.  Mom's not in the room.  Right.  That kind of stuff.  I get what Jerry's saying because me and Anna have been at this 17 years now.  Yeah.  And our listeners are still the same fucking age than when we started. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Right.  It's really creepy.  Like, we're the guys that were with us 17 years ago.  They're all gone.  Yeah, well, sure.  But they were replaced by new young people in general.  Yeah.  I mean, once you hit, you know, adulthood, your tastes don't change that much.  Right.  Right.  So the only new audience is young people that are suddenly old enough to be watching,  get, you know, giggling, laughing, that kind of stuff.  That's why young girlfriends work, Ant.  Exactly.  They're always fascinated. 
[02:07:30]  They don't know.  I like when they're always young and giggling, like Jerry said, and they're fascinated with  things, and they're not on to me yet.  Right.  They hear stories that their mom told all those years ago.  Jerry, when was the last time you were surprised by your show?  Because you've seen and heard it all, right?  Yeah.  Kind of like us.  When was the last time you were like, oh, wow, that's new?  No.  Or really just knocked you off your feet a little bit.  It may be the first year.  No, I mean, nothing recently?  No.  Well, I'll tell you why.  And if you think about it, you'd give the same answer. 
[02:08:00]  However, you can't be a grown-up in today's world and be shocked by anything you hear.  True.  You may be surprised that it happened to someone you know.  True.  But how?  We've talked about this, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, really, what is...  You really can't shock anyone with anything.  Right.  Whatever you hear, you say, yeah, I know there are people that do that.  I may not know someone or someone I know who hasn't done that particular thing, but there's  nothing.  So I can't really say, oh, my God, you really?  You did that?  I usually say, story useless without video. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  That story you're telling me?  Useless.  Where's the video?  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  Let me see it.  Now I want to see it.  We were joking earlier, because we still get labeled shock jocks.  I'm like, really?  It's like, there's no such thing.  What are we going to say into this microphone?  It's not going to make people go, oh, they just watched a horse kill a man by having sex  with him on a video, and we're going to shock you?  Look out of here.  That's a good point.  There is nothing.  There is nothing.  Maybe 10 years ago, sure, but not anymore.  But to compliment you guys, what you guys can do that other people don't is that you 
[02:09:00]  Bump Tom Papa last minute?  But you get honesty out of your guests and stuff that a lot of other shows don't.  You know what I mean?  It's more revealing and honest, which I think is the shocking thing now.  Yeah.  That probably is the most shocking thing you can do on radio now is get honesty out of  people.  Yeah.  Because they're not just selling something.  Yeah, and have a show that isn't just your run-of-the-mill morning kind of doing a wacky  question of the day.  Yeah, it's true.  Like Sugar Ray Leonard was in here recently.  He's like, oh my God, I wasn't going to talk about that today. 
[02:09:30]  Right.  Something about it.  He started tearing up.  He started tearing up.  That was weird.  Really?  He might have been touch funny when he was growing up.  Wow.  Might have been.  And he admits it to us, though.  Right.  I know that's the thing.  And he's welling up, and he goes, wow, I wasn't going to talk about that today.  Yeah.  Don't tell anyone.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, keep that under your hat.  Keep it on the QT.  I get that on the show.  Someone will be on the show, and they'll say something.  He says, God, but don't tell my mom.  Hey, hey, see that big camera right there?  And I walk him over to the camera.  I say, touch this.  And I did that. 
[02:10:00]  I said, you look, see in this lens?  On the other side of this lens is everyone you know is out there.  Do you think the economy is going to tick around just enough this year that it's going  to help Obama?  Well, I do think he's going to.  Oh, look, anything could happen.  So as we're talking, something major could happen in the world.  But I do think Obama will be reelected.  You do?  I think so.  And I think the economy is starting to improve.  Not fast enough, but it is starting to improve.  And you know what?  Here's the best sign, the best evidence, I think, that he'll be reelected. 
[02:10:30]  Every standard by which we normally predict elections, like they take these polls, are you happy with  the direction the country's going in?  Like 70% say no.  Right.  You know, which is overwhelming.  And usually that's the indicator of whether or not the incumbent will be reelected.  Right.  But that same poll then asks the head-to-head runoffs between Romney and Obama, between  Gingrich and Obama.  And the very same poll that says 70% of the people are unhappy with the direction the country's 
[02:11:00]  going in, will say in a head-on race, they'll vote for Obama over Romney.  Maybe only three or four points.  Right.  But still, which tells you that people have grown up and they kind of understand that the  president of the United States is not in charge of everything.  What?  Right.  But Jerry, but Jerry, he couldn't have stopped that ocean liner?  Oh, he did. 
[02:11:30]  And then the Republicans came and tipped it.  Ah, that's what happened.  That story.  That is unbelievable.  I was on the Queen Mary this past summer coming back from England.  I'd come over to America originally on the original Queen Mary.  And this is Queen Mary 2.  And so this was like a present for my sister's birthday.  And so we decided, let's, you know, we came over in 1949.  Let's go on Queen Mary 2.  We'll fly to England and then come back on it.  And it really was a great time.  But...  How long does that take? 
[02:12:00]  Well, that's a great question.  Because...  I know it is.  Well, my name's on the wall.  I host the show.  I've been here for a half hour.  There should be one good question.  Nice going.  This time it was only 23 minutes.  I tell a great question.  I do believe the record will stay.  I've had two great questions so far.  Oh, sure.  I got two check marks in front of me.  There you go.  I'm going to have to go to the stenographer after the show.  Right.  On your exiting interview, be sure to point that out.  Yeah.  I am excellent. 
[02:12:30]  And you want to be nice to me because politically I might lean more toward you than Ant.  So let's...  Oh.  You are now my best friend.  Let's keep it together.  All right.  You joined the club that eight of us.  Himmler, Goebbels, they lean more toward me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  But I'll probably somewhere in the middle.  Oh, the Queen Mary 2.  Queen Mary 2, ocean liner.  That's an ocean liner.  That's not in the Caribbean.  Now, when I came over this time, the trip took seven days.  And when we came over in 1949, I was five years old.  What do I... 
[02:13:00]  No, I want to guess how long it took originally.  Yeah.  What do you think?  I'd say probably two weeks.  No, I'd say ten days.  Eight.  Five days.  Oh.  What?  Five days?  How anticlimactic.  No.  Yeah.  Man, when they do this on other shows, it's pretty exciting.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, do you have a buzzer?  Wait a minute.  Jerry, have this dominatrix with us for the wrong answer.  It only took five days.  Five days coming from England to America on the Queen Mary. 
[02:13:30]  Now it takes seven days.  But the reason it takes seven days...  Continental drift.  No.  Oh, I thought it was perfect.  They go longer.  Oh.  No, for financial reasons.  Oh.  They go longer, so you're on for seven days.  They can charge more, serve more meals.  They zigzag.  And all that.  So literally, and then one night, we sat at the captain's table, and he invited us up  on the deck where, you know, where they...  Oh, the bridge.  On the bridge, sorry.  On the bridge where they run the thing and showed us the whole thing. 
[02:14:00]  Well, that is the greatest ship in the world.  Amazing, yeah.  Right, right.  So...  Wow.  That kind of stuff wouldn't happen.  Who would think it only takes five days now?  You'd think they would want to really hit the throttle in the North Atlantic.  Well, because I did ask the question.  When I was up there, I did ask him, you know, what do you do?  You know, are you worried ever about pirates and this kind of stuff?  And they said, actually, no, they're prepared, and he wouldn't tell me all the things they  have ready, but there's no way you're going to get on that ship.  Yeah.  But anyway, he says, we can outrun any ship in the world. 
[02:14:30]  Wow.  It is also the fastest ocean line.  Wow.  By a lot.  Wow.  Wow.  So he says, if we have to step on it, we step on it.  Yeah.  If there were pirates, I could just see Jerry pulling out an index card going, how long  have you been pirates now?  Yeah.  Can you believe they're pirates?  Boo!  Boo!  Boo pirates!  Boo pirates!  Boo pirates!  The pirates are like, fuck you!  Look at them flipping the bird.  Dominatrix comes out.  Yeah, where's the pirate?  Oh, Jerry, Jerry.  The guys on that ship are really trained. 
[02:15:00]  I mean, it takes years and years and years before you, I mean, to work yourself up to  the Commodore of the whole fleet, which this guy was, and he was piloting the Queen Mary  too.  You know, it's a whole lifetime there.  I mean, the training there is unbelievable.  You think most of those guys go down with the ship?  If it's something.  I'm obsessed with this.  I think as a human being, you would save your own life eventually.  Well, although in my lifetime, there have been cases where someone did go down.  I remember, I wish I remembered the name of the ship. 
[02:15:30]  The monitor?  You're so hurtful.  I'm teasing, Jerry.  No, I'm bringing the Dominatrix.  Dominatrix, what are you doing here?  Finally.  So, yeah.  It was a bag.  But, so, yeah, that is the culture.  That is the culture.  These people.  Now, you don't, look, you don't know until the ship goes down, so you'd have to literally  know.  But they're usually, nowadays, usually, they get to be the last person off the ship. 
[02:16:00]  But, nowadays, usually, obviously, usually, but the ship doesn't go all the way down before  someone gets out there.  Right.  So, it's not that many.  Yeah, you don't really have to go down with the ship.  But, and that just shows you, he shouldn't have left, knowing that it probably was okay.  You could step off the ship onto the island.  Right.  Maybe he should have hung out a little longer.  It wasn't likely that the whole ship was going to go under.  Yeah, it was going to go down.  Well, sure. 
[02:16:30]  I think he, and he probably knew what the depth was around the island, knowing that it  wouldn't sink.  He was supposed to.  But now, have you seen some allegations that he might have been with a woman?  There's this mystery woman that was on the ship.  That was on the ship.  That was seen with the captain.  Now, stories are starting to come out.  That seems so unlikely.  Could you imagine, Jerry, if his whole job was thrown away because of some, I don't know,  triced with a woman?  Oh, shit.  That may not have been the only time it ever happened in anybody's career. 
[02:17:00]  Tom, don't look at the one ship.  That happens.  Hey, Jerry, you've had a much better career than I think you would have if you would have  stayed in politics, to tell you the truth.  No, not probably.  Yeah, yeah, you're a little too...  He was the mayor of Cincinnati, Tom Popper.  I know, I know.  1977, I'm going to guess.  Yeah.  Because the Cincinnati Reds were doing well back then.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah, and oh, yeah, I got in trouble there when I rooted...  See, I'm a Yankee fan.  I grew up in New York.  Yeah.  And in 76, the Yankees played the Reds in the World Series. 
[02:17:30]  And it got out that I was a Yankee fan, so the Cincinnati Enquirer had run this headline,  Springer Yankee Fan.  And so when I, one of the games threw out the first ball, I was booed by 58,000 people.  In your whole town, at the time.  Oh, it was horrible.  That's brutal.  You should go into television.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  And the Yankees got swept forward straight.  This was in 76.  Wow, yeah.  Oh, you guys don't remember.  I'm sorry. 
[02:18:00]  Well, they came back in 77.  Yeah.  Now, I remember, I remember right after Lincoln had been shot.  I was listening to my class.  Yes.  How about Gingrich's ex coming out on ABC?  Nightline, right?  Yeah, Nightline.  Tonight, that interview's going to be great.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Ex-wives never really have nice things to say.  They never go away.  Especially if they've been dumped and scorned from another woman.  Yeah.  Well, Newt did it.  Dude, he did things properly. 
[02:18:30]  Oh.  What were you telling me, Tom?  He divorced this woman over the phone while she was in Ohio for her mother's 84th birthday.  Yeah.  He calls and divorces her.  All right.  So far, so good.  He says he's having an affair with a girl that worked for him who's 23 years younger than him.  All right.  All while he's going after Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky thing in the public.  Oh, all right.  See, I like this, though.  What a great guy.  It's a guy that can multitask and a guy that doesn't have to be there. 
[02:19:00]  He can pick up that phone.  The hotline rings for some kind of problem.  He can talk over the phone about it.  He doesn't have to be face-to-face.  I don't have to go to Russia.  That's presidential timber.  If he were a Democrat, he would be elected.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But since his base is the Christian right, this could be a tough one for him.  But it may not, you know, because there's an immediate sentiment oftentimes against the person who's, you know, against the ex.  Right.  And I'm not saying that's proper.  I'm just saying as a political fact of life, sometimes that's the case. 
[02:19:30]  So there could be, whether it's deserved or not, some sympathy going his way.  Oh, I like to see his numbers of divorced men that are for him after this.  Yeah.  23 years younger.  All of a sudden, there's a tick up in the news.  As divorced men, he's running away with it.  But this timing sucks.  So what?  Romney's people gets the ex to go on TV?  Yeah.  The day before the...  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  But I think it could... 
[02:20:00]  The only...  Has to be...  Romney's got to be involved with this somehow.  The way this gets to really hurt Gingrich in the short term, because the issue has been,  is Gingrich electable?  Right.  Not because the conservatives don't agree with him or think he's a good debater and all that,  but because they wonder, in the real world, is he going to be electable against Obama?  Right.  This kind of stuff just confirms those people that say, you know what?  If this is going to be the beginning, just like with Cain, you know, we don't need to be going through this. 
[02:20:30]  What's next?  Yeah.  That's what could affect the South Carolina primary.  Yeah.  Just to run on family values.  He's like...  That's the...  Well, he's...  Oops.  That's what happens when you do that.  And you should just...  You know, that's between you, your family, and God, and keep it out of politics.  Yeah.  And when you put it in politics, eventually it's going to bite you.  Right.  Both sides have those things they're pigeonholed with and have to live with, though.  The right, it is this conservative, moral thing that I love when these guys trip over their own dicks. 
[02:21:00]  Right.  Because, you know, they find out that years ago they did this, that, and they're just preaching morality to everybody.  The worst.  Yeah.  But they get stuck to it because the base wants to hear it.  The base wants it, and they're not brave enough, really, to say, hey, you know, maybe you could relax on that a little bit.  Because then the base goes, wow, what the hell are you doing, man?  Yeah.  It's driving them crazy.  I'm just still stuck on the visual of, gosh, if I was...  If that could only physically happen to me.  To be able to trip on it. 
[02:21:30]  Yes, trip on your own dick.  Happens every morning, right, Jerry?  You got a tiny one, Jerry?  Yeah.  I tripped over my own dick.  You do all right in that department?  You got a...  I don't know.  Jerry does fine.  Have you ever seen me in shorts?  Oh.  Thank you.  Well, well.  You know what...  I just can't play shorts.  It's actually a public violation.  It's just not right.  It's not right.  You know what's interesting, though? 
[02:22:00]  Fucking love Sprayer.  We haven't yet seen, because it's not time yet, but we haven't seen the Republican candidate,  whoever it may be, and I think it's going to be Romney also, go after Obama.  We've seen...  We've heard in the debates...  We're too busy beating the shit out of each other.  Exactly.  More than past elections, I think.  But I don't know how it's going to affect Obama when they finally are able to just focus  on him, all the political ads, the commercials, using his own words against them, which they 
[02:22:30]  love, you know, doing.  Yeah.  But in fairness, first of all, for the last six months, at least the last six months, every  single day has been an assault on Obama, because every one of those debates, they're always  blasting Obama, all of talk radio, all of cable television, except MSNBC, but everyone  else is just so beating up on Obama.  And yet, and yet he still stays ahead of them in the polls. 
[02:23:00]  This is their best shot.  And if they haven't destroyed him yet, you know, because remember, once he's the candidate,  let's say it's Romney, and I think it will be, but if it's Romney, all Obama's going to  do is run all the Gingrich ads, all the Perry ads, all the...  It'll be, and all they'll say is, if this is what Republicans are saying about him, you  know, and in the end, the middle's going to decide, and Obama comes across as just a  calmer, more rational, and on election day, people go into the polls. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  That Obama?  He is a no drama Obama.  I mean, you know, it's just, there's a comfort level.  It's like, you know, we don't need this.  And he's letting his hair go gray, too, finally.  And he killed Bin Laden.  And we killed Bin Laden.  Yeah.  Can you imagine, I mean, really, if you really want to know the quality of this guy, I mean,  here it is, was the biggest thing in America, you know, this was the thing we were all obsessing  about.  He quietly does it.  No aircraft carrier, mission accomplished. 
[02:24:00]  Quietly.  Oh, that was a stab at Bush, Ant, just in case you weren't paying attention.  He did it?  Was it, was he, I didn't see, was he on the helicopter?  It was.  He called the shots.  Did he literally do it?  Yes.  Oh, he called the shots, not the military guy.  Yes, actually, actually.  Okay.  Actually, in the end, he did.  What?  He said, okay.  There were, look, it worked.  Who wouldn't have said okay?  Well, no, no.  See, that's it.  There were, as you know, reading about, there were like four different plans to go.  Right.  He picked the riskiest one. 
[02:24:30]  And he gave the very last, okay, this is the time, go now.  I mean, he, this was hands-on.  Now, if it had failed, he would have been destroyed.  But he took the gamble, he took the responsibility, and it worked.  And yet, he has not been, he didn't for a month, two months, three months, go around the  country, look what I did.  I mean, really, this is a class act.  You may not like him, but he's a class act.  Class act.  Yeah.  What a great, noble guy. 
[02:25:00]  He makes a pretty good point, Jerry.  That's humble.  I like that point, Jerry.  Yeah.  Do you really think Cheney would have done this, the Bush and Cheney, they're, I mean,  good Lord.  They were bragging about it the whole time, and in seven years, they didn't get him.  And they, this, what do you call this, torture stuff or whatever, which happened, which, which  they gave the okay for in what, 2002, 2003?  Like waterboarding and what happened to grab.  So why?  And they said they got all this information because of that.  Well, then how come they didn't get him?  Because our Pakistani allies that we pay huge amounts of money to are a bunch of scumbags. 
[02:25:30]  Well, did they stop being scumbags then when Obama was president bashing Obama?  For your credit, he did it.  You would have nailed him if it didn't work.  Well, everybody would have, but we also would have nailed him if we found out he could have  and didn't do it because he didn't want to risk failing.  But that's the job of a president.  But the fact is he did.  Thank you, Mr. President.  We are so ready to condemn him for things he has no control over.  When he's finally given the information that bin Laden is at a place and you could take him out, 
[02:26:00]  what president isn't going to go in?  Well, the president, Bush didn't do it in the beginning.  When he was running into the hills.  When he was running into the hills, exactly, he didn't do it.  Yeah.  They had him.  Well, they did have him and they let him through.  I think Tora Bora.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Tora Bora.  Exactly.  And that was a problem with the Afghanis.  It's always somebody else.  But the point is we could have gone over just like now.  He's using the Predator drone again.  Look, this time we didn't even tell the Pakistanis. 
[02:26:30]  That's why they were ticked off.  Oh, yes.  Exactly.  So Obama did it without telling them.  Whatever the ins and outs, in the election, all he has to do is, that's a huge bomb he  can drop in the middle of debates.  You know, with your week on foreign policy, we killed bin Laden.  I mean, that's such a huge...  It's going to be tough to get around that one.  It's a big one.  I think he just happened to catch the chair when the music stopped.  That's what I say.  Jerry, is that your real hair? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Jerry's got a great head of fucking hair, man.  How does that happen?  Well, you let your eyebrows grow long and just comb them straight back.  That's from Jerry's...  That's from Jerry's Fondville, actually.  I'll be performing on the QE2.  Just before we go down.  On the Lido deck.  Yeah.  We do have to take a break.  Yes, we do.  Are we saying goodbye to Jerry?  Jerry, what do you got going on, Jerry?  If you want to hang out, you're more than welcome.  I think I'm okay.  I mean, if I can, I will. 
[02:27:30]  But it's up to you.  If you want to.  If you want to.  It's one of these invitations.  If you want.  Hey, seriously.  That's what we did to Tom.  No, that's what we did to Tom.  It's a call back there.  If you want.  If you want.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, let's get together sometime.  Okay, how about next Tuesday?  Oh, if you want.  Yeah, we'd love to have you back.  I better be going.  Thanks, man.  No, no, you can stay.  We're just fucking around.  That was a call back to Tom Papa.  We don't want you to feel unwelcome.  You can open for me at Bananas.  Yeah, Tom Papa's going to be at Bananas Friday and Saturday.  All I'm saying is we've got to take a break and we're getting one of the Jersey Shore kids in here. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, that's what I'm saying.  You know anything about the Jersey Shore?  Vinny's coming in.  Oh, who's coming in?  Vinny.  Oh, yeah, because he has a friend of ours.  Yeah, yesterday I was doing, you know, touring around doing television.  And we always wound up in the same with Ronnie from...  Oh, you were Ronnie?  Yeah, yesterday.  And I admitted that I was his father.  Wow.  That's the breaking news.  Which concerned him because he just found out he's Jewish. 
[02:28:30]  And that's not going to work on Jersey Shore.  No, not on Jersey Shore.  More than Jersey, it could work.  But otherwise...  Jerry was here 45 minutes.  I don't even know what he's promoted.  Jerry Springer show.  You're just promoting Jerry Springer?  I don't know.  Nothing.  I just like talking to you.  He's a brand.  He's coming in.  I know.  I like when Jerry just comes in.  I kind of like that, too.  I don't have any friends.  I want to talk to someone.  And I just hang out.  What a coincidence.  Yeah.  Neither do we.  Yeah.  That's why everybody's here.  I personally hope Jerry stays after the break.  If he doesn't, we understand. 
[02:29:00]  And we'll see you next time.  If you want to.  I'll see who else is offering.  Right.  Well, we are breaking.  And Jerry...  Not Jerry.  Vinny from the Jersey Shore next.  Stay there.  Seriously, XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Right here.  Right now.  Right?  Yeah.  Is that that song?  Why, Iraq? 
[02:29:30]  Why?  Oh, it sounded like Right Here, Right Now by Fat Boy.  What is this?  Oh, yeah.  You're right.  It is right here, right now.  Ah, stupid Iraq.  Dummy.  What a dope.  What a dope, Iraq.  Oh, you're dope.  Did you pick the song?  It's the new Springsteen.  I don't pick that shit.  It's the new Springsteen single.  You gotta pick that.  You picked the songs.  How did you not know what it was?  I'm sorry.  You knew a song past 94.  Oh!  Oh!  It's been waiting to say that for a while. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, you're the dummy.  Shit!  Shit, that's gonna hurt.  Wow.  Damn.  Iraq's been working on his comebacks.  He really has.  That didn't come from his brain just now.  No, that was written down somewhere.  That was right from the big gut.  That's been in his computer for months.  I finally get a chance to use it.  Damn it!  Tom Papa, Bananas, Hasbrook Heights, Friday and Saturday night.  If you want to.  If you want to go.  If you want to go.  And he's got a Tom Papa live thing from New York City on iTunes. 
[02:30:30]  If you want to.  We were supposed to promote that on our show, but there was a misunderstanding.  What's that about?  If you want to.  There was my Comedy Central special.  It's the album.  Remember we talked about that two hours ago?  On the iTunes.  If you want to.  But on the iTunes.  On the iTunes.  You can download it on the iTunes.  See, that's nice.  I know what Ant did there.  I was trying to plug my own show on iTunes.  Yeah, it's a segue to talk about his podcast.  Because iTunes, because live from the compound is now on iTunes.  Yeah, he doesn't care that you have something on iTunes. 
[02:31:00]  He knew that would lead to his promotion.  Yes.  I am finally making up for 17 years of never plugging anything.  I've never plugged a thing on this program.  It's a desperate feeling, isn't it?  Except my brother.  When are they going to mention Bananas?  When are they going to mention it?  How can I get it in without sounding like a douche?  That's so fucking funny.  We all feel that way, too.  It really is.  The CNN should be able to fucking promote whatever the fuck we want.  But you want to be cool.  I am feeling quite douchey about it. 
[02:31:30]  You're right.  That's funny.  I know on Twitter, I'm always like, okay, I got one more joke and then I can plug my dates.  Right, right.  One more really funny joke.  Got to earn my keep.  I got to jump through the hoop and then I get the fish.  Right.  Yeah, so make sure you get that.  Is Vinny here?  Oh, Vinny from Jersey Shore?  Because we're not staying late today.  Maybe his name's not in the system.  I bet he can't.  I bet he doesn't know Travis Teft like I do. 
[02:32:00]  Kenny, what happens?  Club Soda Kenny.  Wow.  He won't be here for another 10 years.  Oh, no.  Was that the text you got?  Is that a joke?  Date 1-19-22.  Why did he write that?  So he's going to be here in 10 years?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  This is his release.  And it seems Vinny signed it and then wrote the date as 1-19.  Roland pre-fills it out for the artist to sign. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, so Roland put that 19-23.  Roland did that?  Roland's drunk.  Roland's drunk.  I'm not afraid of him.  Oh, shit.  Oh, finally.  Finally.  You're like Marky Mark on a plane full of terrorists.  Oh, my God.  But wait.  That just got real serious.  That wasn't even Kenny making a joke.  He doesn't make jokes, by the way.  He's got a big mouth.  He's all bark and no bites.  Oh, shit. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, my God.  The panda does have a natural enemy.  The problem is, though, he knows, like, I can't put my hands on him because, you know, I'll get fired.  Wait, you and Roland have had problems?  In the past, there was an incident.  There was?  What was it?  He didn't let you in the building?  No.  That's Tom's problem.  No, Tom, that's a special problem.  Only you have had that problem.  I would love for Roland to call me at six and tell me not to show up. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, why is that a bad thing, Tom?  I don't understand why that's a bad thing, that he can go back to bed.  Look at us spinning our...  If my kids hadn't woken up, it wouldn't have been a problem.  Where's Roland?  Does he want to comment on the club soda Kenny allegations?  You want to?  I want to hear what the Kenny thing was.  Yeah, you can't be vague.  What happened?  Maybe he is scared.  Oh, nice one.  That kind of peer pressure.  Ooh, you're scared.  You're scared.  That kind of pressure only works on the weak-minded. 
[02:34:00]  The parent is going to get you.  During the traveling virus tenure...  All right, hold a grudge, guy.  Really?  God, I thought I held a grudge.  Holy fuck.  Hold a grudge like the JDL.  He was upset with my road-managing prowess.  How could he be upset with that when you have been road-managing for years prior to that?  I don't know.  And I don't think he road-manages.  He just showed up backstage at Jones Beach, and I had to drop everything I was in the middle of doing 
[02:34:30]  to run to the gate to meet him with a laminate.  And you got mad at that?  Well, I don't know.  And then, you know...  This is the one thing that you've held on to?  Wow.  That venom that you've held for so long?  It's a laminate that you had to run to him?  Wait, so you're mad at him?  Or is he mad at you?  Well, no, it's the one.  You know, I'm confused.  He spoke poorly about me after that.  Oh, to certain people, maybe?  I had to bite my tongue, so...  What do you say after that? 
[02:35:00]  It's just between me and you.  Roland talks like he's biting his tongue.  That's a coincidence.  Can I just stand that guy?  Jesus.  What happened?  So he talked to some people.  Yeah, he's...  Behind your back.  Oh, no, he bad-mouthed me to my face also.  He did?  Ooh.  Wow.  Wow.  Right?  Damn it.  He's ballsy, though.  He doesn't back down.  There's a difference between stupidity and ballsy.  Oh, man.  Shit.  That's...  Wow. 
[02:35:30]  And that's coming from Kenny.  Wow.  Wow.  Holy mackerel.  That's, uh...  Wow.  Is that...  New information coming today.  Where is Roland?  Is he...  Waiting for Vinny.  Oh, he's waiting for Vinny downstairs?  Yeah, I'm sure.  Wait, Vinny's not here yet?  He's parking.  He's parking.  He's a big star.  He's a big star.  Why is he parking a car?  I did see them all pull up to the house.  I guess that was the first episode.  And they all got, like, some fucking amazing vehicles now.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What is that about? 
[02:36:00]  Is that real?  What do you mean, what's that about?  Come on.  That's Jersey Shore money.  Come on.  They're rich.  Fucking nice SUVs, Range Rovers, fucking Beamers.  Yeah.  Well, you don't think they're saving their money, do you?  You know, I'm an idiot.  You're right.  Save it?  What?  That's going to work.  That's going to go on forever.  Retirement?  Exactly.  Well, while Vinny parks his own car, even though he's a big star, breaking news, Rick Perry is  dropping out of the race.  Yeah.  Out of the race.  And if this isn't calculated, a little meeting with Mitt Romney, Mitt goes, look, it's time 
[02:36:30]  for you to do this for me.  Maybe I do something for you.  Well, Gingrich came out the other day and said, you know, he's the only conservative and  Santorum and Perry should drop out.  And now he's doing it.  I like when these people drop out because then you see where the percentage numbers go  to the other candidates.  You see who picks up the numbers.  Who do you think picks up Perry's?  I think Romney.  No.  He's, you think so?  No, he's more.  He's, yeah, yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Evangelical.  And I think it goes more to Gingrich or Santorum.  Gingrich or Santorum.  He's trying to help out somebody.  So you think he's trying to help out Newt?  I think he's trying to help out Newt.  In his time of need when the ex-wife gets up there.  This is good, though.  He spills this that he's backing out on the same night that Newt's ex is going to be talking.  So this kind of gets a little of the story.  Yeah.  After tonight, Newt's going to lose the female vote.  You think?  I don't think there are many females digging Newt right now. 
[02:37:30]  I know, but the few that are, oh, okay, I can't support this anymore.  No.  Some fucking girls in their 20s with daddy issues might go after them.  And this is only one of them, right?  The other one was sick when he divorced her.  Right?  This one was at a birthday party.  The other one had cancer.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, but how bad was the cancer?  She was in the hospital.  John Edwards' cancer bad?  Ah, that's bad.  John Edwards' cancer bad is bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really fucking...  He's a dirtbag.  Oh, so bad.  I think he was dropping her off at chemo and getting head... 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  It's like fucking...  Just scummy.  It didn't come off good.  So scummy.  Oh, God.  Dropping her off.  But the Mormon thing just bugs those guys.  The Mormon thing really does bother the right.  Yeah.  It's that Christian right.  They don't see it as...  They see it as kind of a cultish thing.  Magic underpants.  Yeah.  Scientology.  Yeah.  Almost kind of cultish.  Kind of put the Nikes on and cut off your balls and wait for a UFO kind of religion. 
[02:38:30]  The problem is the religion is too new.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just it hasn't been around long enough.  It's got to be around a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Religions are dumb unless they're old.  It really is.  Don't think about it.  No matter how silly old religion is with their beliefs and magic.  Yeah.  It's not as silly as new magic religion.  Right.  Like Scientology with the aliens.  You can't just come up with it now.  No.  It's got to be oldie times.  Like Criss Angel magic? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Is there going to be a Criss Angel religion because of that?  You know, it sounds silly.  And it is silly.  It is.  But give it time.  Yeah.  Give it a few years.  Just add some years to any goofiness.  And it becomes religion.  He has to die first.  He has to die first.  Yeah.  He's got to die first.  No.  I haven't heard it was great.  I asked Roland for tickets about a year ago.  You haven't gone yet?  I haven't seen it.  They wanted like $400 a seat when I was looking for it.  When I asked Roland if I could go, he said, if you want to. 
[02:39:30]  I don't know.  I went to get a ticket at the box office and it wasn't there.  There's going to be some room in the back if you want to.  In the back of standing room only.  I had to get tickets that were marked for Travis Teft.  It was a catastrophe.  If you want to.  We got old Marine checking in.  The old story was that Gingrich left his wife on her deathbed, except that was 20 plus  years ago and she's still alive.  Oh, still alive.  Wow.  See?  Okay.  That's bullshit then.  So it wasn't so bad. 
[02:40:00]  No.  It wasn't so bad that he wasn't there.  I love his excuses.  Well, I was working really hard for my country.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For his country.  For country and cock.  Let me show you my country.  Here's the great peninsula.  Here's the woods up above.  Wow.  They've broken out Tom Brokhoff for this South Carolina.  Oh, no.  He's been making a lot of appearances in the CDC. 
[02:40:30]  Rick Perry's going to drop out.  Except she had a very robust state of the state.  She speaks the other day.  She's working very hard in getting more jobs into South Carolina.  This is so typical of South Carolina, as you know.  South Carolina.  South Carolina.  South Carolina.  Rick Perry's going to come out of the South Carolina.  The best thing, and I've said it before, that I've ever heard Tom Brokhoff have to say  is, Leon Klinghoffer and the Achilles Loro. 
[02:41:00]  It was, ah, ah, he can't say that, can he?  It was a bag of rocks.  Oh, Jesus.  That is a bad lisp to have if you're going to be an anchor.  Leon Klinghoffer.  Leon Klinghoffer was pushed from the neck of the Achilles Loro.  Tom Brokhoff, NBC, and the Achilles Loro.  The Achilles Loro was taken over by terrorists off the coast of Little Africa.  Or typical of South Carolina. 
[02:41:30]  And now, South Carolina, Newt Gingrich.  They're very happy while this, of late, of all, is Rick Perry.  Perry dropping out as Mitt Romney tries to hold on to his blade.  He swallows those L's.  He really swallows them.  What else do you think of the jobs and economy are the major issues right now?  Oh, Jesus, this guy hates black people.  I think that pretty well sums it up, Chuck, for what Mitt Romney has to do tonight. 
[02:42:00]  He has to demonstrate that he's best at home.  What, is there a debate tonight?  You've got to understand, though.  Are we debating tonight, Ant?  No.  No, not tonight.  He's just got to run around and do his thing.  Yeah, they've got to do the, you know, shaking hands.  Last-minute campaigning.  Kissing babies.  Rick Perry looks like a retired superhero, though.  Does he?  He does.  Look at him.  Superman coming back to the Legion.  Like, you know, at one time, that guy kicked serious ass. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He looks like another, like we were talking about before, he's got that Bush swagger.  Yeah.  That Texas Bush, I drink hard and fucking, yeah, let me tell you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Back in my college days.  Talk about my college days.  I mean, put him down like two-fisted.  And I like those New Yorkers.  he's got that same fucking thing going on he does the same movements yeah yeah the same swag 
[02:43:00]  of the laughing i'm only wearing a suit because i have to i have to i usually like yeah yeah yeah  wearing some shirt sleeves getting out there cutting some wood  you gotta end every sentence with that  there's different versions of it of course perry retired from superhero  dumb thank god he's probably going to retire to the fortress of solitude  you know what i said that line and i got nothing and i started fucking sweating and heating up and 
[02:43:30]  and i realized oh they're turning to the tv to see if that was accurate and he is with his wife  louis lane  suspicion of kryptonite  found in south carolina  obviously uh bowing out uh due to pressure from lex luther  lex luther who's going to benefit more rick santorum or lex luther lex luther could be benefiting 
[02:44:00]  as he tries once again to take over the globe both part of the greatest generation  the greatest generation one of my many specials that they keep pulling me out of this closet for  i keep worshiping old people  i'm soon to be one  these my next special these kids don't know shit 
[02:44:30]  on nbc next week  tweet this  stay tuned for the next special  older people kick ass  we don't smell that bad  i i say we bail on vinny soon  what are we gonna get two more minutes  nine yeah it's 9 41  that is what do you think sam  we're being treated like fucking assholes  what do you think the problem is today  well he's parking 
[02:45:00]  who says he's parking  is he having an anxiety attack  i mean roland  i can't believe he's parking  what happened  i had to  this can't be good  does he have other  does he have other shows on the platform  i don't know about that  but the situation  doesn't make sense  because it was first  it's not the situation  it's not  no it's vinney  yeah  it's not  it's not  that's not the same guy  wrong  it was first reported  that he was signing in 
[02:45:30]  oh boy  and then it was  true  then it was reported  that he's parking the car  doesn't happen that way  now what's being reported  So why would someone say he's signing in if he's not signing in?  I'm confused by that.  There's a mole at Opie and Anthony, and Roland is trying to take down the show from the inside out.  First canceling Tom Papa, not allowing passes to Vinny or the situation.

They call him! 
[02:47:00]  Dr. Gay!  Dr. Gay!  Dr. Gay!  Dr. Gay!  Dr. Gay!  Dr. Gay!  Dr. Gay!  We need lasers.  Yes!  Dr. Gay, do you have a news phone?  What's the diagnosis, Dr. Gay?  Yeah!  Dr. Gay!  Right as a prescription for going home, Dr. Gay!  I can only do that so many times.  Yeah.  Vinny's on his way up.  What?  We're going home.  He's on his way up in the elevator.  Does he know he's getting 13 minutes of air time, if that? 
[02:47:30]  Well, I mean...  He's got 17.  Is he only coming in for this show?  Yes.  Dr. Gay!  Wow.  That's your official diagnosis?  Yeah, diagnosis, Anthony.  I'm so happy you made this character.  Vinny.  I love it.  You like the character, though.  Vinny.  I thought you would like it.  Yeah, he likes it.  Vinny's going to find himself on the shit show.  Here he is on the shit show. 
[02:48:00]  Ah, there he is.  Here he is now.  On the shit show.  Quick, Vinny, run!  Vinny, run!  Be on the show!  Be on the show!  You're running out of time.  What, you're parking that fucking nice car of yours, right?  Yes.  We saw you guys all driving up to the house, all the nice vehicles now.  Like, damn!  That's good.  Nothing's changed, you know.  Yeah.  This is E55 later.  I was like, shit, man.  They all got fucking really nice cars.  Damn.  Jersey Shore money.  Yep.  At least it's not, like, my parents' money, you know? 
[02:48:30]  Well, that's good.  Yeah, yeah.  True.  Everyone in Staten Island usually, like, drive Mercedes because their father's a big construction  worker or something.  Busting those stereotypes apart on Staten Island, huh?  The Guinea fucking construction worker.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, I'm in cement.  What?  You want to be?  Hey!  I know that guy!  Hey!  What's up, man?  Let's have it in.  Well...  Vinny, how's the anxiety?  I saw the episode last night.  Anxiety's good.  Right now, it's not bad, yeah.  Under control?  Yeah, it's under control.  It only, it happens to me, like, under really stressful circumstances, such as filming the 
[02:49:00]  show, yeah.  How about hangovers?  Did you...  Hangovers make it worse.  Yeah, right?  You come back to the show, right?  I can't say.  Come on, give us an exclusive.  Exclusive.  My story's not...  We kind of know each other now.  My story's not done being told, I can say that, but...  My story's not done being told by Tom Broganoff.  All right, answer...  Maybe answer this question.  It's very compelling.  Because we talked about it earlier.  When Sam left, and they made a big deal about it, like she was gone a month, and then you  kind of piece it together in your own mind, you realize she was gone one night. 
[02:49:30]  She was gone...  You realize she left on a Friday, and I think she came back in time for dinner on Sunday.  Hey, I didn't realize she was gone.  Yeah, she was gone for like three days.  Hey, what's that picture we just saw?  Well, I mean, this is just TMZ.  Oh, yeah.  On July 2nd, 2011, Vinny leaves the Jersey Shorehouse for good.  Yeah.  Right.  July 10th, 2011, Vinny is back in the Jersey Shorehouse.  Oh, come on now.  That's TMZ, though.  What are you doing?  Sam.  Sam. 
[02:50:00]  Sam, no one reads TMZ.  Why would you do that to me?  And this ain't a shit show.  It's a New York show, motherfucker.  Fuck, dude.  I can't believe that.  We're friends with this guy.  We're going to help him out.  It sounded so much cooler when I said I can't say if I come back.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I would guess a week.  Yeah, something like that.  I would guess you were gone a week.  Well, we only filmed for like six weeks, so...  Six weeks?  Isn't that amazing?  Well, we did it back-to-back from Italy, so...  No, I know.  All together, it was like four months.  But the first season was longer than six weeks, right?  No, it was like six, seven weeks.  So you guys don't really know each other. 
[02:50:30]  Well, we've heard somebody 24 hours a day after six weeks?  Are you kidding me?  I know more about them than I want to know.  You pretty much know them at that point.  We remember reality shows.  This is how old me and Ann are, where it took six months.  What, like the first real world?  The first real world were six months, and no one will film for six months anymore.  The first real world is known as the greatest generation of reality stars.  Just because it's old Tom, we know.  God.  And by that, I mean Tom Brokaw, not Tom Papa. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, you walked into a lot of things.  Yeah, you walked into a lot of things.  Papa, NBC Nightly News.  The greatest generation.  The greatest generation.  All right, we get it, Brokaw.  Old rules.  So you're not shit until you're shitting in a dip in.  Just because you can't wipe yourself doesn't mean you didn't have a long, luscious life.  He used to be an old news anchor, Vinny.  Oh, really?  Tom Brokaw?  I don't think he knows Tom Brokaw.  Oh, I thought this guy was. 
[02:51:30]  Is there any chance you live with Roland?  Yes.  Fucking Roland, the destroyer.  So the anxiety got to you, huh?  Yeah.  Between Italy and going right to Jersey, you were like, I need a break from this shit.  Now, I used to suffer with this, so let me ask how bad it was.  What do you mean used to?  How do you get over it?  That's good.  Medicate?  No, you do kind of just get over it after a while.  You reach a point where you're fed up with it enough to say, I don't care what happens.  Because you always think you're going crazy, or you're going to drop dead, or you freak 
[02:52:00]  out, you think you're going to lose your mind.  But then when you finally just go, fuck this, go ahead, do whatever you're going to do, and  I just have to deal with it because I can't deal with this anymore.  And then when it doesn't happen, you're like, cool, I'm over it.  It was the resistance that was making it happen.  Yes, that's what does it.  It was more anxiety of getting an anxiety attack than the actual anxiety attack that  would happen.  And then the second you get a tinge of a feeling of anxiety, you'd build it up into like this 
[02:52:30]  where you become ultra aware of sight, sound, smells, touch, everything.  And you find yourself just like, ah!  And you're freaking out.  That happens because it's actually a survival mechanism.  Anxiety.  Dr. Vinny's going to tell us now.  I'm going to tell you, I'm a professional.  Because every time you learn more about it, so anxiety is like your pupils dilate because  in the wild, if you really had something attacking you, your eyes would open up wider.  That's above 120, 50 he's talking about.  And things seem like, you know, your body temperature rises and, you know, it's all a survival mechanism. 
[02:53:00]  Yes, it's primal physical shift.  But anxiety is when nothing's going wrong.  Like if you're sitting here with you, there's no fucking bear attacking me or anything.  I'll still suffer.  I'll still have the same symptoms.  It's like, I got to get out of here, you know, as you know.  Yeah, yeah, that's a fight or flight.  When I'm on the show, it gets, it gets, because everybody gets it once in a while.  You get it for five minutes, you go on a plane, this and that, whatever.  Yep.  But on the show, when it happens, it happens chronically every day for about like weeks  in a row. 
[02:53:30]  That's crazy.  Going to bed with it, waking up with it.  At that point, then I'm like, all right, now I have to leave.  So it's not just like, oh, I'm having anxiety, you know, it's like, it's like chronically  24 hours a day, this feeling of disconnection.  Did you talk to someone?  I mean, yeah, I talk to like a therapist and everything, but sometimes.  I got to ask though, I got to jump in.  Even all that pussy doesn't take care of it?  It's good, but that's great.  That's the best medicine.  Is that like taking a pill when you knock back some pussy?  You're on camera, you don't have a cell phone, you're mic'd up, there's bright lights in 
[02:54:00]  your face, you know what it's like.  Ultra, ultra aware of everything.  Can you imagine though, he said something there, imagine not having your fucking cell  phone anymore.  We're all so used to it now.  And they just take it away from these guys when they enter the house.  To not get Kenny's call in the morning to wake me up?  I don't know what I do.  And you guys ever sneak a phone in or anything?  Because now, you're almost at the end of this run.  We're on camera.  Let's start talking about stuff.  We're on camera, 24 hours, we can't sneak anything.  No one had a phone, like, alright, I'm going to just hide behind a pile or something? 
[02:54:30]  Not that I know of.  No, not that I know of.  That's crazy.  That would be crazy.  I never did.  I mean, I just sailed through.  Yeah.  But sometimes you have a cell phone, I know we're like a slave to it, but say someone's  pissing you off, pissing you off, you just look at it, it's kind of like an escape  for your mind for a minute.  Over there, you have no escape, you're just stuck with each other.  Oh, right, yeah, that's true.  Like, during the little downtime or something, you just pick your phone up and ding, ding, ding,  stuck all around.  Yeah, it makes you feel a little better.  Yeah, yeah.  Over there, I look next to me, and there's Snooki, I look next to me, there's the situation  and my anxiety. 
[02:55:00]  Jesus, a breakdown.  Wow, man.  I watch the show, I gotta ask you, situation, what the fuck?  He's crazy now, huh?  Yeah, he's always been crazy.  He's always been fucking crazy.  Yeah, but now it's coming out, like, he's obsessed with the Snooki thing.  Is he just trying to get, you know, more exposure or more airtime?  Because it's fucking weird now.  I mean, true colors always end up showing, and he's always been like that, but in the  beginning, everyone was like, you know, oh, he's cool, he's a guy's guy, and, you know,  you just see his true colors.  For the people that don't know, situation, it's pretty obvious, had sex with Snooki. 
[02:55:30]  Snooki's denying it.  Well, blowjob.  They're saying blowjob.  I'm not confirming.  I'm not confirming.  I'm denying.  I'm not confirming.  Allegedly.  Come on, Tom.  Allegedly.  And now he won't drop it, but he also won't go all in and really, you know, blow up her  spot.  Right, right, right.  Which is making for, you know, pretty good TV, I must say.  Yeah, I like it.  There's nothing to really, I don't know, there's nothing really else to fight about, you know?  So they keep fighting, and, you know, every time it causes a war, and it's interesting, 
[02:56:00]  and, you know, they capitalize on it.  And this new season, which I'm watching, I'm going to keep saying that, Ronnie and Sammy,  we don't have to deal with that shit anymore, right?  No, they've been so good.  But do you miss it a little bit?  No!  That's good, yeah.  No?  No!  That's good, no, because people are wondering, like, oh, is that drama over, and now people  aren't interested?  No, we got your drama.  Yeah, exactly.  My fucking anxiety attacks, thanks.  You're going to do a long weekend in Staten Island, you'll be back. 
[02:56:30]  A long weekend!  Jesus!  Some pasta, some Uncle Nino's vino.  A little of the wine, man.  He's causing your anxiety.  That's better than Staten Island.  I've hanged out with you guys a little bit to know that Nino is causing your anxiety.  He adds to it.  Hey, forget about it, right?  What am I talking about?  Hey, what was that?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Exxiety, what the fuck?  Yeah, you can see Vinny start sweating when he just hears the impression. 
[02:57:00]  What the fuck?  Exactly.  Is he here?  Yeah.  I'll give you anxiety up.  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck?  Suck it up.  I'll walk it off, kid.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  You're really related to that guy, right?  Yeah.  Because you couldn't be more different than him.  I don't know.  That's so fucked up.  I'm selling a ship and it's a rock.  I jump off.  What the fuck?  I get a life.  I get a life on now.  Anyone else on the ship?  Fuck them.  I say that.  What the fuck? 
[02:57:30]  What the fuck?  Is Jersey Shore done?  I don't know.  There was rumors yesterday about them scouting locations.  So they let us know literally like right before we go.  Like a month.  They've hinted that maybe you guys are done.  Maybe they go new cast, too.  No, this is shit.  They always hint.  It's all rumors.  I don't know.  I have no idea.  Negotiating ploy, I bet.  I have no clue.  They let us know right before.  It's such a weird reality TV.  So weird.  But they would have called you by now, don't you think?  For a new season?  Maybe.  I'm thinking soon.  Maybe last minute. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  They probably do that shit last minute.  They do it last minute.  Let's do this again.  Fuck it.  Yeah.  There's no security.  All our other pilots failed.  Yeah.  There's no security in this business that we call show.  No.  And that also gets you so anxious.  Yeah.  Because you don't know, yeah, doing great, doing great.  In the shitter.  Right.  What happened?  Yeah, exactly.  This is fantastic.  There's no fucking job security or anything.  Right.  We've talked to just about all of you.  The only ones we haven't had is Ronnie and Snooki. 
[02:58:30]  Snooki refuses to do the show or whatever.  But you're like more.  She could suck my.  Oh, wait.  But you're more serious.  And Vinny sees past this.  You want to be doing other things.  Yeah.  When Dean is like, I don't know.  I feel me drunk again.  I don't care.  But Vinny is like, this is all good.  It's been nice for me.  It's given me some things and some money and this and that.  But I just know you want to jump past this.  I'm not.  I'll be the first to admit.  That's why there was some rumors that when I left the house, people were saying Vinny's 
[02:59:00]  a pain in the ass and shit.  Like, I'm not the to the producers.  I'm not the best reality star.  You know what I mean?  Like, I don't fit the bill at all.  I think that's why they kind of picked me.  Yeah.  That's why I have a lot of fans, you know, because.  But I think you also want more for yourself.  Oh, yeah.  This is.  Of course.  In this business.  Of course.  You know, like I want to I want to go back to school eventually.  I want to, like, you know, get a law degree, get a Ph.D. or something.  You know, like, I'm glad I've made this foundation financially for myself.  But, like, I would love to go back to school and to, like, have a life, a real academic 
[02:59:30]  life.  A real academic life.  I could give you that.  Dina would, you know, she'd rather, like, bend over, touch her toes and let someone rub  their cocks on her ass.  Yeah, man.  That is.  Hey, I like her.  I'm just saying, though.  It is hilarious.  You feel like you know these people after a while.  So what do you think what do you think everyone from the Jersey Shore will be doing?  It's a it's a hack question.  I understand.  In five years from now.  Go down five years from now.  OK, Paulie, I think, will still be a very successful DJ. 
[03:00:00]  Like what he does.  So, you know, he's a big following situation.  I'm not sure.  I don't think that much.  Pornography.  I'm thinking male.  I'm not like saying like not doing anything.  Everyone's going to be doing something.  But like, you mean, like someone's going to be famous or this and that.  Just in general.  He has like a lot of endorsements.  Maybe he'll be cashing his checks off of that.  Maybe you'll hear you'll see him once in a while.  You haven't heard from him that like like when you guys are just bullshitting about things 
[03:00:30]  he wants to do or any.  He's he has like party.  He has like 50 different endorsement deals and products and shit.  Like, I can't keep up.  Yeah.  Every every week he's he has a new thing.  Like, I swear to God.  So I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  Yeah.  But he's going to burn out quickly.  You think?  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know how well these products do.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm getting a nod from somebody.  That's all I'm saying.  You know, I'm not. 
[03:01:00]  So yeah.  Yeah.  What about Snooki and JWoww?  Well, I think they're filming a spinoff show.  So I think their their fame can can last a little longer.  It's going to be those two.  I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  What can they?  I don't know what what they want.  What their five years.  You know what I'm saying?  Sam will be just married with a bunch of kids.  That's obvious.  She's got nothing going on.  She's nice, though.  Nothing going on.  Really has nice legs and all.  Sam is really nice, sweetheart.  Yeah.  But I don't think she's going to be in entertainment.  Ronnie can maybe open up a gym or something. 
[03:01:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I'm trying to think of like the talents.  You know what I'm saying?  Like that manifested in five years.  Dina?  What do you think of Dina?  Rubbing cocks on her ass.  She's going to just be a cougar somewhere in Jersey.  She don't care.  I need to be on the Jersey Shore.  That's content for her.  Did we miss someone in there?  Paulie.  Paulie.  No, we got everybody.  I think we got everybody.  Hopefully some acting for you, sir. 
[03:02:00]  Acting, yeah.  The book thing is big, too.  What's the book thing?  The book thing.  You guys don't know?  I have a book coming out.  Well, no.  I'm just saying it like it's a natural conversation.  You want me to do everything?  Maybe.  You should be.  I didn't want to drop that.  I don't want to drop it.  I thought that's how it works.  Like, maybe you have a book coming out.  So, you've got a new book coming out.  What's that all about?  If you listen to book radio, maybe we'd know.  But you mentioned it first.  So then my natural thing is the book.  What's the book?  Oh, fuck.  It's called Control the Crazy.  My plan is stop stressing, avoid drama, and maintain your inner cool. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, see.  That's coming out in the spring.  It's different than just, hey, here's some pictures of the house.  You had the anxiety your whole life?  Yeah.  My whole life.  Off and on, yeah.  Oh, that's a bitch, man.  In high school, really, I had my first panic attack.  Oh, how'd that go for you?  It was great.  It was great.  You know, I was sitting in class.  I was learning about Huckleberry Finn, and all of a sudden, I felt like impending doom  was rising from the apocalypse.  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.  I went out with a girl in Buffalo that got panic attacks. 
[03:03:00]  Fuck that.  It sucks, right?  Holy shit.  I'm not even joking, man.  We'd be in a restaurant.  I was making no money, so I would collect my money so I could take her out on a nice  little date at a nice restaurant.  Red Lobster?  No, man.  I was really trying.  And the appetizers come out, and also, she has a panic attack.  We've already ordered our food, and I'm like, what?  What do you mean we've got to go?  And they're not understanding at the restaurant.  They're like, well, you owe whatever it would have been back then, a couple hundred bucks  or whatever.  No, you would never know that I can be having an anxiety attack right now. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Me, personally.  Yeah.  I left so many situations.  I'm just a kid from Long Island trying to get something done here.  I'm dealing with a girl with panic attacks.  Oh, jeez.  You know, it sucks.  It's brutal, honey.  It happens to so many people.  Yeah.  It's a good way to get out of it.  But it's an anxiety.  It's a...  I'm going to talk about it.  It's a self-help book on, you know, not even anxiety, but, you know, just general fucked  up shittiness in general.  Yeah.  Because what happened was, when I started getting it, I never took medicine.  I never did drugs for it, unlike Uncle Nino. 
[03:04:00]  And I read probably like 30 to 40 self-help books.  I was banging out, like, two a week.  So, you know, I kind of made my own in my voice, like, for this generation.  Right.  And it talks about the same things.  I'm sure.  Well, I believe the older books were probably better because there wasn't any anxiety.  It was called Life.  It was called Life.  But, Ed, you said something really brave there.  You just said, one day, fuck this. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, but, you know what?  I don't know if a lot of people could get to that point.  I'm thinking.  It was, that's at the point where you're just so fucking fed up with living with it  for so long.  It's called acceptance.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really, it's not any bravery.  It's not any, it's just, it's actually giving up.  You're just saying, look, fuck it, take me, whatever you're going to do.  Right.  And then when nothing happens because, you know, it really is just a chemical thing.  A chemical thing or whatever.  Yeah.  When you fight it, it's making it worse.  It's a fighting mechanism.  You know what I mean?  It's protecting you from a fight.  So when you fight, it's just making it worse. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Just go with the flow.  And you probably, because a lot of people I've spoken to, you think a lot.  Oh, man.  Like, see, that's, people that are just content to sit and look at a pinwheel, I envy them  a lot because I sit there and if you're alone with your own thoughts too much, you could  work yourself up into a tizzy.  And we film with nothing.  It's a dead space.  We can't read.  We can't write.  We can't do anything.  So you're just there with your own devices and that's fucking dangerous sometimes.  For four months at a time, you know? 
[03:05:30]  And from my mind, that's crazy.  Yeah.  You tell Snooki to live in fucking Macy's window for fucking two years.  It's a bit like doing cartwheels and backwards and shit.  Exactly.  That's it.  You can't fucking sit there.  You start thinking about deep thoughts.  My mind is too fucking active.  Yeah, like there's a bunch of shit going on.  That's exactly it.  There was one time I felt so bad for you.  What happened?  We were in L.A. and you were going through a major anxiety attack.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  I'm like, that is fucking hell on earth.  Oh, it's terrible.  Without getting into details, you were just in a place of my heart.  Oh, I know.  And then I would self-medicate with like beer.  Yeah.  It was great.  After a couple of beers, you're like, what the fuck was that?  It was nothing.  And then you're just waiting because you know when you stop drinking and get hung over,  it's ten times worse.  Oh, my God.  The hangover is worse.  Now you have a hangover and anxiety.  Which is all we have to do on the Jersey Shore is drink.  Drink.  Drink.  Boy, you really are in a fucked situation.  Yeah, fucked.  You don't drink like that normally, do you?  No. 
[03:06:30]  I don't drink like that.  No.  Why would I do it to myself?  You're taking a funnel and putting it in your throat.  Drink for the show, you motherfucker.  No, why do you want to go to law school?  Yeah.  Listen, sleeping, like not sleeping right usually for anybody can cause like depression and  anxiety and shit.  Yep.  I'm prone to that already and that's what we do every day over there.  It's fucking crazy.  Lack of sleep, drink, fucking nerves.  Never see the sunlight.  No distractions.  You are fucked.  I got a Jersey Shore question.  You think Gianni is aware of what Snooki's all about? 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, well, she did it to him on camera.  I know, but he seems to always be looking the other way.  I mean.  Looking the other way, yeah.  I don't know why.  Yeah, look, why do you think that is?  You know, jet tickets.  It's kind of like, oh, really?  Was that the kid we saw at the Jets game?  That's hilarious.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's before I knew who Gianni was.  Yeah.  Oh, he's a puppy dog.  That's, okay.  I get it now.  We were all over at the Jets game like, who is this sap with Snooki? 
[03:07:30]  Sorry.  I was really thinking that.  It's Gianni.  He says he wants like this proper girl that doesn't get drunk and show off her fucking hooch.  Well, is there a man out there that like would accept, if a girl cheats on you and calls  you up, you've been broken up with her for 24 hours, she calls you up and says, listen,  I just fucked some guy.  Is there any man on earth that'll be okay with that?  Done.  No.  Done.  He was.  You were that guy, by the way.  I was that guy. 
[03:08:00]  See, he didn't want to say it.  He needed me to say it.  See, he didn't want to brag too much.  It was like some guy knowing that someone would take the bait.  Some random guy.  Now I'm getting ahead of this whole radio thing.  Some adorable.  And the weird part is he was all right with you.  Because I guess technically they were broke up, but he obviously is not all right.  Bros before hoes, Hopi.  Bros before hoes.  Bros before hoes.  You got to be a bro first.  That was the battle cry on the beaches of Norman. 
[03:08:30]  Check games.  I do want to bring up one other thing, Vinny.  Yeah.  I was very impressed.  I know how this shit is filmed, but I was very impressed by your basketball skills.  Oh, thanks.  I saw the video.  Yeah.  I'm playing in a game tonight.  I'm trying to make this NBA team.  This is an all-star game.  Who filmed the video for you?  Just a friend of mine.  Yeah.  He fucking didn't use landscape.  Tell him 90 degrees with the fucking phone.  90 degrees.  That portrait shit drives us nuts.  I'm fucking lucky I hit the shot.  That three quarters. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, it was so great.  How many of those did you take?  Three times for that one.  Wow.  And I can prove it to you.  If you say it, I believe it.  No, the reason why you know is because I came up and I spoke to the camera.  And I said, hi, I'm Vinny.  This is why you should pick me.  I said, I'm only going to do that the first three times.  I'm not going to keep on fucking saying that every time I take a shot.  I'll be dead.  That'll take forever.  Yeah.  Third time.  I hit it.  I like the body English you put on it, too.  You lean.  Just to explain, you made a video because he wants to be part of the NBA. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, I want to be part of the NBA or All-Star Game.  All-Star Game where it's a celebrity game.  I don't really have that many connections in there, so I'm using my social media presence  and my fans to help me out.  And I'm making people tweet, put Vinny in the game to the NBA.  And hopefully I put out this video to show that I can play.  I've been playing ball my whole life.  I'm from fucking Staten Island.  What about the other shots?  How long did it take for the other shots?  A long time.  I was tired at that part.  I had some little kids give me rebounds.  Just over and over again.  Over and over again. 
[03:10:00]  I think you hit five, though, of monster shots, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One from three quarters and then two from half court.  The three-quarter one was like it was shot put.  You shot put that thing.  That was sick shot, right?  That was pretty impressive.  Thanks.  They can find the video where?  On my YouTube, on my Twitter, Vinny Guadagnino.  Everything is my full name, Vinny Guadagnino.  YouTube, Twitter, Facebook.  Yeah.  Tumblr.  Yeah, Tumblr.  Tumblr.  Tumblr.  Google Plus.  Yeah, and Twitter.  Stumble Pond.  Shorty Awards.

Life Saving Hero?  What are you laughing at?  That's pretty good.  I was up there with that chick.  It's a different one.  Is it Ksenia?  No, you got a different chick now?  It's a different girl.  Oh, my God. 
[03:11:00]  Every time Vinny comes in, we have this one girl.  I know, right?  Remember that girl?  She's pretty hot, too.  Yeah, she is.  She wants to be Vinny.  Who is she?  Bring her in.  She works here.  Bring her in.  Bring her in.  Bring her in.  You're leaving, Tom?  Why?  Yeah, I got to roll.  I have something to 1020.  What are you doing?  Whoa.  Bye.  Oh, she's pretty hot.

We're also running you on our channel this weekend.  Your interview with Jim Norton will be Saturday at 11 a.m.  and Sunday at 6 p.m.  Cool.  Oh, that's awesome.  It's a new thing we're doing on.  The time you did that with Super Dave Osborne. 
[03:12:00]  It worked?  It was great.  I got a great response.  Thanks a lot for that.  Yeah, we started a new thing on the weekends called Friends of the Show, and this week we feature  you.  Awesome.  It's slightly better than the shit show.  Slightly.  Slightly.  That's pretty easy to do, though.  Do you work here?  You.  You.  Me?  Yes, I work here.  I know everyone else works here.  Take it easy, man.  Yes, I work here.  And you're a fan of Vinny?  And I'm a fan.  What do you do here?  What I do, I'm a music programmer.  Oh, for what channel?  For whatever channel needs help. 
[03:12:30]  Book radio?  I have a book.  Book radio, yeah.  See, you got a book series.  What is a music programmer?  They put the music into the show?  Um, you sag up music, you load in DJs or whatever.  Oh, that's impressive.  I like girls that, like, do something.  Really?  Yeah?  Like, that's me.  If you're wearing a uniform right now, it'd even be better.  Like, I like a uniformed girl.  Yeah, like a girl that does something.  I love waitresses.  Really?  I'm a bartender.  You're a bartender?  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  I like the, do you wear the cocktails?  I used to love waitresses, too.  I know what you're talking about.  You know what?  There is something when they're wearing, like, a black and white fucking dress-looking  thing.  It's stocking.  They look all hot, walking around with a little tray.  And then, like, and I'll be like, oh my god, I love that girl, whatever.  And then, like, meet me out.  And then she'll come in regular clothes, and I won't be into it anymore.  Oh, really?  Meet me out in wearing a uniform.  Yeah.  Her book are you.  Her job's so important, she could be here right now, so.  That's true.  She doesn't have to work.  So you ever make your way by this side of the building?  I do. 
[03:13:30]  I just, I've never been in here.  I don't think we've ever seen you walk even, walk past.  Always bringing girls in here that have never been in here.  That have never been in here.  I could give a shit about this show is what it is, Vinny.  Until Vinny comes in.  And then Vinny comes in.  How do you not know?  It's like, oh, yeah, I'm coming up.  It's the Odie and Andy show.  What?  The Odie and Andy show have Vinny on.  We did get Odie.  What do you like about Vinny and the Jersey Shore?  What I like about Vinny and the Jersey Shore, first of all, I'm super hot.  Oh, thank you.  All right. 
[03:14:00]  Second of all.  He's got a big penis, too, you know.  Big penis.  So I hear.  Big penis.  I know you want that out there, Vinny.  I know you can't say that yourself.  She knows.  Because that would be bragging.  She knows, because I watch.  Are you bummed out that he left with the anxiety thing?  Um, yeah.  I mean, I'm not.  He comes back in a couple of days.  It's no big deal.  It's really no big deal.  It's really.  They might stretch it out a couple episodes.  But, you know.  He'll be on like three episodes.  No.  Maybe.  Max.  What are you going to do?  Jeez. 
[03:14:30]  I know.  I have to look at another guy on the show.  Are you like Native American or something?  I am not.  Oh.  What are you?  You'll never guess where I am.  Nobody ever guesses where I am.  I say Guatemala.  No, but close.  Peru.  No.  Trinidad.  No.  Honduras.  Honduras.  Close.  Give me a map.  I'm right in the wheelhouse.  You know any other places down there?  Colombia.  No.  No.  Oh, shit.  It's one of those countries that a lot of starving kids are from.  Yes.  And you got to send money for kids with cleft palates. 
[03:15:00]  She's perfect for you, baby.  That's one, too.  Are you from Paraguay?  No.  Is it something we've ever heard of?  Barbados?  Is Haiti down that way?  Are you Mayan?  Ghana?  Belize.  You'll never guess.  Belize.  Camden.  No.  Newark?  God, I need a damn map.  I don't care this much.  Central America.  Nicaragua.  Wait, Central...  Oh.  Panama.  No.  Panama.  All right, I'm going to my Central American map. 
[03:15:30]  Chile.  No.  Is it what Rihanna is?  No.  You're Bolivian.  No.  All right, hold on.  I got the map coming.  Google Maps, baby.  Well, for you listeners, she looks Native American.  I look Native American?  A little bit.  I think so, yeah.  Everybody tells me I look Sicilian.  Really?  I can see that, too.  Yeah.  You know the Moors.  All right, you're from...  I'm Sicilian, 100%.  Bulgaria.  You're from San Salvador.  El Salvador, yes.  El Salvador. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, we could have got that.  El Salvadorian.  How did we not go without this, like, Contras?  Shit.  Are you a Contra?  That's crazy.  El Salvador...  That's a crazy place to be from, I think.  Someone's saying El Salvadorians are hot.  Yeah, she's all right.  I'm all right.  MS-13.  I meant that in a good way.  What happened?  You know anyone from the MS-13?  I don't know anyone from MS-13, but I've heard stories.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Wait, were you born there or not?  No, I was born here.  Okay.  Oh.  Parents born there?  Parents, both.  Both born there? 
[03:16:30]  Yes.  Oh, and then they snuck over the line?  And then they snuck over here to have us, yeah.  Because the last girl, she was cute, but, like, I'm not impressed by, like, Dominicans.  That kind of Spanish, like, when they say they're from, like, El Salvador or something,  it's more impressive.  It's more exotic?  Yeah, it's more exotic.  Then, ah, I'm from Dominican.  That's like, ah, you're Puerto Rican.  Meanwhile, it's still another island with, like, poor kids, but, like, it's just not as 
[03:17:00]  impressive for some reason.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you send money back to your country?  I do not.  Oh, come on.  I know.  I have to get back.  That is messed up.  Well, you know, to my family and stuff.  Oh, you work at SiriusXM.  I'm sorry.  There you go.  They should be sending you money.  Yeah, they should be poor kids sending you mud and fucking garbage from a dump.  They sent you money from El Salvador.  That's how sad this place is.  That is pretty pathetic.  Yeah.  You want to go out on a date with Vinny?  Because we're running out of a show here.  Sure.  Let's go, Vinny.  What are you going to do?  Okay. 
[03:17:30]  You do stuff?  Do I do stuff?  Yeah.  What do you mean, do stuff?  I'll bowl.  I'll do anything.  I'm down for anything.  Do you know how to talk down somebody that's having anxiety attacks?  Yes.  I can calm you down.  What if I start freaking out?  Would you be all right?  Yeah.  I think I can handle it.  Do you have a script for Xanax?  That's a good girl.  I don't do drugs, Vinny.  That's terrible.  Down for anything or DT?  No DTF, okay?  Listen, when a girl says she's not DTF, that's the universal statement for I'm DTF. 
[03:18:00]  That is not true.  Yes, it is.  Words of wisdom.  That is not true.  Just so you guys know.  She just doesn't want to announce it to a fucking...  Right.  I am from Jersey, but I'm not a Jersey little...  Whore?  Poochie mama.  No.  What town in Jersey?  I live in Clifton.  Oh.  Okay.  Is that good?  I live in Clifton.  Which is like...  All DTF girls in Clifton.  Oh!  That's not bad. 
[03:18:30]  I'm from Patterson, okay?  I'm from Patterson.  We're even worse.  I live in Clifton.  Patterson's bad?  I'm kidding.  How's this bad, right?  How's this bad?  If a girl's saying, I never do this kind of thing before...  Whah!  Whah!  I think it's more mature for a girl not to say that and just to not do it, you know?  Cigars and Scotch is fucking hilarious.  He's so wrong.  He goes, DTF.  She's down to syndrome.  This is DTF.  Oh, boy.  What?  I don't know.  Here come the letters.  I just found it funny.  Here come the letters. 
[03:19:00]  What?  Letters?  Who writes letters?  I can't believe Vinny said that.  I didn't say that.  Oh, my God.  Don't joke around.  Don't joke.  No jokes.  It's a radio show.  So you don't have a boyfriend?  I do not have a boyfriend.  Oh, how long have you not had a boyfriend?  This is, like, embarrassing.  No, it's not.  It's just life.  For, like, four years.  Why so long?  I don't think my life feels.  Oh, man.  Why so long?  I don't know.  I don't find the right one, I guess.  What are you looking for?  Are you, like, very involved in your career here?  Career woman. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, you should have a boyfriend.  I work a lot.  Okay.  That's a turn on.  And you got all your body parts.  You should have a boyfriend.  All ten fingers and toes.  You got everything, man.  Do you date?  I date.  A lot?  Not a lot, but I date.  What kind of guys, like, pop up on the dates?  Apparently some of the wackles.  Like weirdos?  Yeah, I feel like so many guys are weird.  Yeah, that is true, man.  It was so interesting that he closed his laptop.  I could always close my laptop.  It doesn't take a lot of thought.  You know, we can't kick that.  Slam down the edge. 
[03:20:00]  We're turning the lights off.  That's a universal, yeah.  The music's coming on.  You kids exchanged numbers.  I wish I wasn't late.  Damn, man.  No, but, all right.  Well, you two can, you know, exchange whatever you need to exchange.  Wait, who are you voting for?  Uh-oh.  See?  No, I need a political girl.  Wait, who is Vinny voting for?  Don't say it.  I'm trying to think.  Who am I voting for?  Yeah, the little I know about you.  Okay.  Come on.  I don't even know who I'm voting for.  I don't think he's...  Exactly.  He's not an Obama guy.  ABO.  You're a Republican, right? 
[03:20:30]  Not really, no.  I'm Independence Party.  There you go.  Oh, Ron Paul?  I'm Independent.  Ron Paul type guy?  No, he scares the shit out of me.  He's not independent.  He scares the shit out of me.  I'll probably vote for Obama again.  What?  Just because, I mean...  An Italian from Staten Island.  Wow.  Vote for...  Anxiety, bro.  Anxiety.  It's opened me up.  Oh, is that it?  It's opened you up?  It's enlightened me.  It's opened you up?  I would imagine you're the only one in your family doing that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You should see us something down at the table.  We don't need to talk about it.  Hey, fuck it.  Oh, forget about it.  Come on, man. 
[03:21:00]  What the fuck?  Not because I like Obama.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  What the fuck?  Moody.  Not because I like it.  I'm just scared of the other guys.  Yeah.  Those crazy white boys from Texas and shit.  I don't mind them.  They're kind of fun.  I like Newt.  Newt is cool.  I like Newt.  Yeah, yeah.  I think Newt's good.  And then what's Romney?  I like Newt's attitude.  Romney's so moderate.  I like experience.  Yeah?  So I feel comfortable when someone's been doing it a long time.  You like experience and you voted for Obama last time?  The guy was like, he had a clubhouse.  But he was smart.  You know what I mean? 
[03:21:30]  He taught economics.  Harvard.  He taught law.  I'd like to see what he wrote.  I think this president should be the fucking smartest guy ever.  Yeah?  Yeah, the smartest guy ever.  I don't know if that makes a good president.  Really?  Yeah, I think he ought to be all right.  But the smart people are kind of weird.  Like real smart people?  Yeah.  It's like when I was talking before about us.  Like a smart military guy.  We're really smart.  And then we have anxiety.  Yeah.  See what happens?  You want a president laying there freaking out?  Abraham Lincoln.  He got anxiety?  Depression.  The worst.  Oh, man.  Yeah, I read his book. 
[03:22:00]  Well, I guess his mind got taken care of.  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  You need a few cc's of lead delivered by Dr. John Wilkes Booth.  Why is he depressed?  Why is anybody?  Why am I depressed?  I think because his wife was always fucking ragging around the house because their kid  died.  It was terrible.  Winston Churchill.  Yeah.  He called it the black dog.  Every once in a while, he would say, like, listen, guys, there might be a time, even if  we're in the middle of a war, you know, where like for four days I'm just going to 
[03:22:30]  be in my room by myself.  Puffing some cigars.  The smartest minds, and not to brag or anything.  Well, it's true.  Because it's what I said.  Plato, Aristotle, they all have had, you know, anxiety and depression.  It's because you're left alone with your thoughts like that.  Just thinking and freaking out.  Well, don't freak out.  No, I'm good right now.  I don't have it that bad.  It's just like, you know, in that situation I described to you, it comes up.  Yeah.  Get all tense.  All right.  What are we promoting?  The book comes out in April.  Promoting sex with his lovely girl.  Oh, sorry. 
[03:23:00]  She's not DTF.  Remember?  Don't want to come on.  Yeah.  Control the crazy.  It comes out in April.  So.  You'll come back for that.  Yeah.  On my Twitter.  I just announced that it's happening.  And, you know, just keep up.  We'll have you back before that.  Oh, I would love that.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Hope you guys are on.  We used Uncle Nino at our live broadcast.  I know.  I heard people were like, I'm like, how was it?  He's like, it was disgusting.  It was.  It was disgusting.  What the fuck?  People eating their own puke and stuff. 
[03:23:30]  It was fucking disgusting.  Other people's puke.  Yeah.  It was heinous.  Oh, that was Pat Duffy.  It was amazing.  Fucking people.  I don't get it.  People don't want to watch the video.  It was so gross.  And they shouldn't.  It's disgusting.  Really?  Yeah.  I like stuff like that.  Yeah.  And tweet, put Vinny in the game, remember, for the NBA All-Star game.  Right.  Yeah.  And that's all I got right now.  I'm amazed you have so many followers on Twitter with a last name like that.  Right?  Holy fuck.  I'm looking at it.  I'm looking at your last name and I don't know how to spell it. 
[03:24:00]  Guadagnino.  Yeah.  G-U-A-D-A-G-N-I-N-O.  Yeah.  Crazy Italian pronunciation.  It's not going to need more followers.  They're doing real well.  Yeah.  All right.  Are you guys going to do something or what?  Maybe.  We'll see.  Yeah.  Let them-  Do you follow me on Twitter?  I do follow you on Twitter.  All right.  Cool.  She'll tweet me after this.  All right.  There you go.  I see them.  I make believe I'm too cool.  I see that shit.  Yeah.  I'll look for you.  What's your name?  Angie.  What's your name on Twitter?  Oh, shit.  You want followers?  What's your name on Twitter? 
[03:24:30]  DJ Ang 3.  Oh, she's a DJ.  Nah.  I like that.  Oh, shit.  She did it for the wrong reasons.  Oh, okay.  I'm not so much anymore.  You can't get fame off me.  Why aren't you?  I can't get fame off me.  Oh, damn.  Please.  That's hilarious, man.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I love it.  All right.  All right.  I guess that's it for us today.  All right.  Vinny, thanks.  Thank you.  Always a pleasure.  Always a pleasure.  Absolutely.  Love it.  Love you guys.  Thank you for dropping in.  Thanks, Angie.  Come by anytime.  I'll come by every week. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, sure you will.  Come back when I'm out here.  Prove it to them that you like them.  All right.  We've never seen her before.  We won't see her again.  Never.  Until the next time.  No, that other girl, we've never seen her.  No.  No.  We've seen her twice.  Two times when you were here.  That's so funny.  You're one of the biggest shows in this building in the world.  She had no idea what you guys look like until today.  She didn't even know what.  She never seen a picture.  But I asked them.  I was like, show me them.  I don't know who they are.  She works here.  She works here.  Well, maybe if our picture was in the lobby instead of the book lady from book radio. 
[03:25:30]  Don't get upset about that again.  I am so pleased.  I'll put a huge picture of you on my desk.  Oh, great.  Right behind the one of Vinny.  Two anxious Italians.  I know, right?  Well, very good.  Have a great day.  And I'm on Red Eye this evening on Fox.  Yes, you are.  Shilling for the right is what they say when I'm on Fox.  I got to tweet something so people know you were here.  Yeah.  And on Red Eye.  Hold on one second here.  One, two. 
[03:26:00]  I tweeted you guys.  People know.  Oh, yeah.  I got you.  We're good.  We're good.  We're good.  We're good.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thank you.  Oh, the great Ronnie B doing the show with us tomorrow.  Looking forward to that.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  I don't know what it is. 
[03:26:30]  There's Who Kid walking out with Opie.  Coming back in here.  Is he?  Yeah.  Who Kid, you can't stay off the show.  No, no, no.  What do you got going on?  Am I on?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're giving out free condoms over there.  So I thought...  You don't use condoms.  What are you going to use them for?  I thought I'd start the year.  That's my resolution this year.  Okay, so they're going to make it easy for you.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  You've interviewed all the Jersey Shore people, right? 
[03:27:00]  Most of them?  I just saw them leave here.  Have you interviewed Vinny before?  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't do all the shows around here.  Like, he does our show.  Yeah.  But he doesn't do a lot of other shows.  He didn't freestyle?  I thought y'all were doing, like, bars, like, back and forth.  We don't do weird shit.  Like, you're thinking of your show.  So, um, but every time Vinny comes in here, somebody who works here ends up drooling outside  the window, one of the females.  I was not drooling outside the window.  She still got, like, some, some, some, I don't know, some kind of...  Some saliva? 
[03:27:30]  Maybe some of that phlegm, like you were talking about.  Yeah, I might be like, ugh.  That's DJ Ang.  DJ Ang 3 on Twitter, right?  Yes.  You're going to get a lot of followers today.  That was, like, my first Twitter name.  But now I feel like I can't change it.  You're going to get...  Well, now you can't, because how many followers do you have?  Not many.  You should check again, because DJ Ang 3 on Twitter.  Are there pictures of you on your Twitter?  There's one picture.  Yeah, that's enough.  That's all the people, that's all the listeners are looking for right now.  Vinny turned you on?  Um, he's super hot.  For real?  Yeah.  You got a heart on?  You don't think so? 
[03:28:00]  Sorry, he gets girls to get heart on.  Did you have a heart on?  Um, not so much.  So you met him, though.  Like, you've seen him on the show a bunch of times.  You finally met him today.  He did it.  His game, he was a little bit cocky.  Yeah.  You know.  He's just guy.  He was being a little bit vicious, definitely.  How did you feel now that you kind of know him off camera a little bit?  He's cool.  You like that?  Yeah.  You like a cocky guy, though.  You like when guys are a little bit of a jerk.  Obviously, that's why I don't have a boyfriend.  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  You just get dumped constantly?  Oh, my Lord.  You just get dumped by jerks all the time.  She goes, uh, my Twitter name's DJ Ang 3.  And he goes, oh, no, I can't date any DJs.  You can't get famous off me.  No way.  And she's still just looking at him like, you're so hot.  You like torture?  Apparently.  How come Vinny is the guy for you?  Vinny isn't the guy for me.  Well, I mean, the Jersey Shore guy is done.  Um, because he doesn't wear all that.  You don't like the hair gel?  The hair gel. 
[03:29:00]  He's not all stocky and tan.  You don't like that.  You like normal looking guys.  You would bang him raw?  He's a normal looking guy.  Okay.  She skipped that question.  Well, she said, on our show, she said she's not DTF, down to fuck.  Vinny said that when girls say that, the only girls that say that are the girls who are down to fuck.  Who are DTF.  Oh, for real?  So, would you, though?  I'm a good girl.  All right, let me ask you this question.  If Vinny, who you met today, he were like, let's exchange numbers. 
[03:29:30]  And you guys did, right?  And then he texted you later, and he was like, yo, why don't you come hang out with me for a little bit?  And then you hung out.  It might happen.  We might have to go, like, on three dates.  With Vinny from the Jersey Shore.  With Vinny from the Jersey Shore.  It might happen in the first date.  No, it will not happen on the first date.  Would you give him, like, just head in the first date?  No.  The head is head.  It's not.  That's still, no.  You've never given it up on the first date?  Never.  You never even give up your mouth on the first date?  Never.  Jesus. 
[03:30:00]  Kind of hoochie mamas are you guys?  It sounds boring for you.  Can I get a wet hand?  The oily, the oily, what do you call it?  The oily hands?  I don't know what you call it.  Don't ask me what I call it.  I don't know anything about that.  That's fine.  What's your nationality?  I'm from El Salvador.  Wow.  You don't give it up.  I went out there.  I got it, like, once I landed.  Like, once I got off the airport, I got it.  Did you pay for it?  There you go.  Well, yeah, I mean, what's wrong with that?  Vinny said you're very attractive.  Was that a compliment to you?  Were you like, did that make your heart go pitter-patter a little bit? 
[03:30:30]  A little bit.  Yeah?  Do you have, like, do you just think he's attractive, or do you have a little crush on him?  No, I think he's cute in his whole family-oriented way.  You like the whole, okay, so you like him as a part.  You have a little crush on him.  I don't want to say a little crush.  Why not?  I don't know, because I wouldn't say it was a little crush.  If his album came out, would you buy it?  No.  Why?  Vinny got a new album coming out.  He has a new album?  Yeah.  Because he's got a, now, what about the anxiety disorder thing?  Because his book is coming out, and he's talking about his anxiety, and how he was suffering 
[03:31:00]  from panic attacks.  Serious?  Yeah, and he was going crazy.  That's why he left the Jersey Shore house, because he was going nuts.  I think anybody would go crazy there.  But is this something that you could deal with?  A guy who has panic attacks?  Depending how serious they are.  He also has a chin sweating disorder, too.  Like, his chin sweats like crazy.  That I won't be able to do with.  No, that's crazy.  Did he discuss, or you just noticed that?  No, I gave him, like, napkins when he came on my show, but he just kept wiping his chin.  I was like, what happened? 
[03:31:30]  I got a chin problem, you know?  Sweat.  Do the girls, when he's on your show, do girls stop by?  Like, oh, shit, Vinny's in there.  I see they get boners.  That's why I want to ask them if she got a boner.  Because this is the second girl.  What about, okay, you know.  But I wasn't drooling outside.  Well.  I wasn't, like, stalking him.  I'm just saying what the perception was.  I didn't even know he was there until you got it.  Yeah, but then once, I was like, she was at work.  Working.  And it's like, hey, Vinny's back there.  Do you want to meet him?  Yes, of course I do.  Yes, I do.  Just throwing all her stuff aside.  You know the other girl, though.  Oh, that's why I saw you and her running from, I saw y'all running in the house. 
[03:32:00]  And you saw me trying to catch up with her, right?  Yeah, I was like, what's going on here?  You can't run that fast.  The reason I said boner is because they say that part of the vagina that looks like.  Clitoris is what it's called?  Yeah, but it looks like a little baby, whatever, penis.  They get boners from you.  Who are you hooking up with that they have little penis clitorises?  You don't have that?  Are these girls you met in El Salvador?  El Salvador had a really good time, but I'm talking about her.  I know you travel a lot.  You'll be in Istanbul this weekend.  You examine your part, right?  My part.  You look at it, right? 
[03:32:30]  Every girl looks at it, right?  Do you go to the mirror and you look at it?  Like you spread and look like your own gynecologist?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't have insurance.  You don't have a degree.  I have to make sure everything's okay.  Yeah, I'll make sure.  All right.  Because, you know, El Salvadorians, they check their joints.  El Salvadorians don't check their joints.  They check it.  Well, everyone should check, right?  I don't.  It's a matter of health.  You don't want to see what's down there.  Help!  Who can leave his vagina alone?  No, but back to the burner.  Like, all right, you got a burner when he left here, but it's that little thing that 
[03:33:00]  it just pops up.  Is that what happened?  No.  No.  Well, you haven't had a chance to examine yourself yet either, to be fair.  Can we examine our stuff?  I mean, look, she's an employee.  We're way past an HR issue at this point.  We're going towards lawsuit territory.  There's a little sexual harassment up here.  But, and yeah, and who can, like, he's got his own little deal going with the company,  so he doesn't have to worry about it.  He's trying to point it off on me.  The girl who came in here the last two times that Vinny was here, the same girl, coincidentally, 
[03:33:30]  was Kenya, was just walking around, and she goes, oh, look, it's Vinny from the Jersey  Shore.  I've never been here.  And she came in.  She's your friend.  Yes, she is my friend.  But you didn't care today.  You were like, let me go in.  Let me scrub my stuff.  She's not here anymore.  She doesn't work here anymore?  No.  When did she stop working here?  Like, I want to say, like a month ago almost.  Nobody told me.  No, she's not here anymore.  Did she get sick handed or did she quit?  She was on a temporary position.  Oh, okay.  So it just expired.  Yeah.  But still, she's got a radio.  She still has love for Vinny.  And now her friend is like, don't worry. 
[03:34:00]  I'm not, like, on his junk.  You were a widow.  You were like, you are so hot.  Right?  What I want to know, does she have a photo of Vinny?  All this stuff going on.  Boners and sweaty chins.  I don't think she's actually said anything about boners.  Those are both things that you brought up.  All right.  Did you get a photo of Vinny?  With him, yes.  Oh.  Okay.  Why?  Is that okay?  I thought she didn't have a photo.  I thought, oh, this stuff.  Oh, and she never took a picture?  Yeah.  Sex man.  Sex bagel took a picture with her and Vinny. 
[03:34:30]  You're like a bad fan.  Like, you wouldn't give it up the first time.  I don't understand.  I'm not like a groupie.  Like, Vinny, though.  Who are you a fan of?  Like, what female reality star are you a fan of?  Female reality fan.  Snooki, of course.  Would you give it up to Snooki on the first night?  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  She's going to take my penis and put it in her pocket.  Leave with it.  Really?  Yeah.  I love her.  Vinny was on the show today saying that he thinks, like, when the Jersey Shore people  go on to the next part of their careers, Dina, Dina Nicole, whatever her name is, she'll 
[03:35:00]  basically just be getting Cox brushed on her ass for the rest.  That's her whole future.  Oh, shit.  That's great.  You think that's a good future for a woman?  I mean, yeah.  It was a Jersey Shore, for Christ's sakes.  But seriously, isn't Kenya going to be, like, upset by this?  Why would she be upset by it?  Because that was her thing.  She's here by herself, right?  She has his phone number.  I don't have his phone number.  I have his Twitter.  Oh.  Oh, did you get it?  Oh, so he gave her his phone number?  Yeah.  Were you like, whoa? 
[03:35:30]  No.  Were you upset by that?  No.  Did she give her?  Did she give Vinny hit?  No.  Oh.  Well, she got the number for her.  Maybe she hasn't had a chance.  Did she use the number?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I wish she was here.  When was the last time you used that beautiful mouth of yours?  What type of question is that to ask?  We're on air.  There's a lot of people hearing, right?  Right.  I want to know.  Inquiring minds.  Did you have an answer to that?  I'm going to pass on that.  Okay.  Okay.  Hang out for a sec.  Next question.  I'll tell you when the last time my mouth was on something. 
[03:36:00]  Luke, I know you're always looking for the next big thing.  And DJ Ang 3, I know you're looking for the next big thing, too.  Luckily, we've got him on the phone right now.  What?  Brian Fenkart.  First of all, Brian, how's it going?  Good, man.  How are you doing?  I'm doing very well.  And I have to give you credit because a lot of people, I think your boss is looking for  you, kid.  A lot of people would, like, try to Hollywood up their name a little bit because on first  pronunciation, Fenkart is a hard name to say.  Like, I'm saying it right, right? 
[03:36:30]  Yeah.  That's the polite way to put it.  It's hard to say.  Yeah.  Frank Hart.  It's not the prettiest name, yeah.  But at no point did you say, did you make a conscious effort to say, I will not change  this name?  This is the name that my father gave me?  Oddly enough, yeah.  Because it is a terrible name.  And I just, I feel like, I feel like if I change it now, like, I'd have to go through  this whole process.  At this point, I'm just lazy.  Plus, it's Brian with a Y.  So has anybody ever, is it Brian spelled with a Y and then Fenkart.com? 
[03:37:00]  Is he black?  Has anyone, no, he's a white guy.  Has anybody ever found your website?  You know, that's a good question, but I think probably at least seven people.  Yeah.  Well, BrianFenkart.com is the website.  You just released, on Tuesday, the new album.  You've actually been on the show before.  You came up with Greg Charles one time with your band.  Can I see the album?  That's hot.  Yeah.  Check it out.  Extra hot.  Woo, kid.  That's the new album, Simple and Gray.  We have a copy of it here.  It just came out on iTunes.  What's your sound, as they say in the biz, Brian? 
[03:37:30]  How would you describe it to the people?  It's very singer-songwriter.  You know, like the phrase, Sara Bareilles, kind of that piano-based pop sound that's going  on right now.  You know, I was raised on Billy Joel and, like, Springsteen.  Who is my man right there?  I got you.  Oh, Billy Joel, man.  He's a genius.  That's the legend right there.  I'm supposed to stop writing in, like, the 90s, but...  Yeah.  Well, maybe, are you saying you're here to pick up the torch?  Like, all right, Billy Joel, stop writing.  Brian Fankart is in the house. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, but Brian would have to fuck his video chicks.  See, I would have to do that.  Marry them, too.  I'm not saying I'm complaining.  I'm just saying I'd have to.  Oh, okay.  That's DJ...  I'll take one for the team.  That's DJ Who Kid from Shade 45 that you're hearing.  He's also a 50 Cent's DJ.  He's a big name in hip-hop.  It sounded in the description.  Like, I've heard your music, and the way you describe it, it does seem a very, like,  sort of a white audience type of thing.  That's hot.  What can you do to sell yourself to somebody like Who Kid? 
[03:38:30]  I don't know what you're talking about.  Well, I have to play it on Shade 45, because you've got to want all the exposure you can  get at this point.  Am I right?  I got white fans.  This is true.  This is true.  We may have to do some remixing.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know who I can hire for that.  Get Diddy on there, or my man Reef in here.  Brian, you're an accomplished singer.  Like, this is not some guy who decided, all right, I'm going to make an album now, because  you were an understudy on the Broadway show Memphis, right? 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Now I'm doing the tour of the show.  Now you're doing the tour, first of all, but this is not like a Showtunes-y album.  No, no.  Yeah, no, there's not a whole lot of high-kicking and tap dancing or anything like that.  No, it's just a straight-up pop album, really, you know, pop rock kind of thing.  Yeah.  You know, even the show itself is a lot more rock than most Broadway musicals.  It's got a lot more, because David Bryan, the guy from Bon Jovi, wrote it. 
[03:39:30]  When you're on Broadway and you're an understudy, are you just looking for opportunities to,  like, push people down the stairs and stuff and, like, you know, put a little flu virus  in their soup or whatever tricks you need to do to get on that stage?  Uh, no.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, no, you don't need a jacket out there.  Go ahead.  Shake the fan's hand.  Don't wash it afterwards.  That's what the Pauly D. did to Who Kid.  That's why. 
[03:40:00]  That's why.  That's how he got 50 Cent's job.  Yeah, sweaty chin, baby.  Exactly.  I'm, I'm, I was perplexed by that.  I'm glad I have somebody who's actually a music guy here to talk to, Brian.  Somebody who's, like, a professional, you know, he's putting out albums.  The name of the album, again, is Simple and Gray.  It's on iTunes.  I'd recommend it.  The Grammy Awards are coming up, and they introduce that LL Cool J is going to be the  host.  Yeah, that's going to be L right there.  What are you climbing?  Wow.  What do you, what do you think?  I mean.  He's accepted by white people. 
[03:40:30]  What do you think of LL Cool J?  Did you hear about this?  I didn't hear about this.  You're the first I'm hearing of this.  Yeah, LL Cool J.  I think that's awesome.  Is going to be the host of the Grammys this year.  And CIS, baby.  And CIS.  Obviously, the Shade 45 contingent is happy about it, but what do you think?  White power.  About LL being the host?  Well, I have no idea what to think of that.  I've never seen him try to host anything.  That's weird.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, he's not a host.  He's hosted things before.  What's he hosting?  It's not that he's like.  He's good.  That's LL.  Come on. 
[03:41:00]  What's he going to say?  Sam, why are you hating?  Is he just going to sit there licking his lips while he's presenting awards?  LL is simple and gray.  You know what I'm saying?  He's going in right now.  Simple and gray.  White power.  That's the name of the album.  Who kid?  Always a professional.  You know, and where are you at, Brian?  I like picking your brain on this stuff.  You don't know.  I'm glad I was able to inform you of the LL thing because you need to be aware of what's  going on with the Grammys because between you and I, I see this album of yours as album  of the year.  That's my list. 
[03:41:30]  I don't know if it's a Grammy, but that's my list.  Well, hey, that's mine too.  I'll be.  Yeah.  I don't know, man.  I didn't even know about that.  Like, I feel like he'd be, he's fine.  He's charismatic and everything.  I've just never seen him try to host anything.  Well, I know him.  So if you want me to have him like put you in a category and make you the winner.  Just slide it in.  And you go out there and just be like, yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  I'll just slap the envelopes out of the presenter's hand.  Yeah.  Then you'd have to pronounce it though.  That's the problem.  Yeah, that's true.  You're going to have to get like a phonetic spelling.  I'm going to have to. 
[03:42:00]  Well, it is though.  That's the problem.  Fenton can't be more phonetic than it's spelled.  Fenton.  No one knows how to spell it.  Fenton.  Yeah.  The name is Brian Fenton.  And that's Brian with a Y.  F-E-N-K-A-R-T.  It's K-A-R-T.  Hey.  You can't even spell it.  K-A-R-T.  F-E-N-K-A-R-T.  It looks like a misspelled word.  He looks like he gets all the bitches though.  It's like a sneeze.  Do you, who kid wants to know?  How are the, you're touring.  You're touring with Memphis.  Are you touring with your music too?  Kind of.  You know, like I'm doing gigs on the road when I can.  And I'm doing promotional stuff like singing on morning shows and doing stuff like that for the album. 
[03:42:30]  You know, but I haven't had a whole lot of time aside from the show to do much else.  How do the girls respond?  The bitches.  The bitches is who a kid calls them.  The bitches.  Yes.  Well, they love it.  I mean, depending on the age group, there are, of course, girls that I can't talk to for the most part because they're like 14.  Damn, man.  You don't respect R. Kelly, man?  I know one thing.  As my wife toured in Broadway productions and especially in the musicals and stuff, the straight guys get all the ass. 
[03:43:00]  Is that what's going on, Brian?  Well, because we're the minority here, dude.  Yeah.  It's, you know, it's not a straight man's world, the Broadway musical.  So we do okay out here.  That's good.  So right now, in terms of –  Brian's eating.  In terms of – he's being –  He's being humble.  Yeah, exactly.  Is it literally or the hip-hop eating?  In terms of –  I think potentially both.  Oh, okay.  In terms of the girls, Broadway is better right now than – because I guess the music attracts the underage crowd, 
[03:43:30]  whereas Broadway might have some more of age people.  Although Anthony from the show has never had a major problem with, you know, maybe not 14, but 15 is all right.  Yeah.  If you're in Europe –  Well, yeah, 14 and 15, there's a big gap in there.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, they say it's only a year, but it really seems like more –  But Broadway bitches are more educated, right?  Like, they're not like, oh, I'll suck that dick.  Is it – what is a Broadway groupie like?  They don't sound like that.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:44:00]  What is a Broadway groupie?  Are they a little tougher to practice?  I would love to taste your penis.  Oh, a nice proper –  Excuse me?  I would love –  By the way, somebody make sure somebody isolates that Who Kid drop every time he comes on this show.  Hey, yo.  I know you had to record that.  I hate you.  I'm out of here.  What are you – where are you at with –  By the way, I just want to – I came in here to tell you that you're fired.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  That's Who Kid's boss reads.  Where are you at with the internet piracy deal now?  SOPA, I guess, is trying to shut down piracy on the internet, obviously. 
[03:44:30]  That's so cool.  Yeah, but you as a musical performer, it's a lot harder to sell records now because of the internet.  It is harder to sell records, but I mean, honestly, without piracy, a lot of people wouldn't have even been heard yet.  I mean, like, it's not even that I'm promoting it.  You know, like, I personally try not to ever, you know, download anything illegally, but also to each their own.  Like, you know, a lot of people get heard because they're getting music shared with friends. 
[03:45:00]  I mean, with the record companies dying out, it's one of the only ways to even get heard now.  Well, listen, if you want to hear Brian Fenkart, it's B-R-Y-A-N-F-E-N-K-A-R-T.  Go to his website, brianfenkart.com, and the album is Simple and Gray.  It's on iTunes now.  Where are you right now?  We're in Philly right now.  That's where we're on the tour.  Well, next time you're in New York, you're welcome to stop by after Opie and Anthony Live.  Ah, and hang out with Prime Time?  You know it.  Bring some bitches. 
[03:45:30]  I'm a big wrestling fan myself, so, you know, we'd have to chat.  Oh, well, you'll have to come to the top of the hour then.  That's all we'll talk about.  That sounds good to me.  All right, man.  Thanks a lot.  Good luck.  Take it easy, man.  Thanks.  All right.  Can I take this album?  Because I've got to leave.  Simple and Gray?  Simple and Gray.  It's on iTunes now.  I want to check it out, man.  I wish my Tom Papa interview had gone that well last week.  He's a comedian.  He was on the show today.  You saw him.  That's my boy.  Yeah, he left right when you came in.  Yeah, Tom Papa, but it was horribly awkward last week.  Because he thought he was calling Opie and Anthony, and he calls in the after show, and I pick 
[03:46:00]  up, and he knows me as the idiot who sits in the corner, you know, and so it just got  weird.  You should have called me in, man.  I got some bitches last time.  You know, the marriage ref, right?  Reef, doesn't Who Kid work here?  By the way, the views of DJ Who Kid do not reflect SiriusXM, Sam, myself.  Thank you, Reef.  You know, we have to say this over and over.  Like some bitches, man.  Me and the marriage ref, man.  You understand.  This is like, he's like, I'm a co-host on this show now. 
[03:46:30]  Like, this is his home now.  I love it, man.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  This is crazy.  I got a new album.  Simple and Gray.  Simple and Gray.  By the way, Brian Fankhart, I think he could use like a stage name for his last name.  Something, right?  You know, like Brian Gray or something.  Simple and Gray.  Brian McKnight.  That's a big name, right?  Brian McKnight.  It's already being used.  I think somebody used that.  Somebody got that?  You like DJ Ang 3?  What kind of music are you into?  You like the poppy stuff? 
[03:47:00]  Hip-hop stuff?  Hip-hop, R&B.  Reggaeton.  Because in Spanish, I have to like reggaeton.  She said that with an accent.  She rolls that R.  She rolled the R in front of Vinny.  I just got very excited.  You like that?  Yes.  You like the roll of the R?  She was in here, Reef.  I don't know if you know this.  This is DJ Ang 3 on Twitter.  Yeah, she got a boner from Vinny.  By the way, I mean, I know O&A were talking.  Opie said you were all right.  Yeah.  That was the best compliment ever.  That was hot.  That's how Opie compliments women. 
[03:47:30]  He goes, you know, you're all right.  And she's sitting there like, all right.  You should have got a boner from Dad.  I got a boner.  Ant said she was hot.  Vinny said she was very attractive.  The audience wants to know.  She's DJ Ang 3 on Twitter.  Does she have a picture?  On Twitter, right?  You're not following me.  What's up with that?  Let me follow you now.  Let's go around.  Reef, what's your Twitter name?  At NYC Reef.  NYC Reef.  That's Who Kid's boss.  He's the one who is Who Kid.  At my nuts.  Who Kid doesn't even need.  Follow that.  You want to have 200,000 followers at this point? 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  Who doesn't even need.  I'm not going to follow you.  At my nuts.  At my nuts.  I don't know.  No one wants to follow those.  But you don't have no bikini photos of you on Twitter, do you?  Damn.  You're such a nice girl.  Well, not yet.  I know a little known fact about DJ Ang 3.  What do you know?  I know that you are a cheerleading coach.  You're a cheerleading coach.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you tell.  Oh, hotline.  Uh-oh.  I'm hot.  Who Kid, did I win any headphones? 
[03:48:30]  That's, uh, you know who that is?  Okay, I'm best at that.  That's Roland.  Roland likes to prank calls sometimes.  I think he's calling in the wrong day because we have a Hermaphrodite special on Saturday.  I thought Saturday was your George Lucas special.  In the morning, we have a Hermaphrodite special.  All the Hermaphrodites call up and they win a pair of free headphones.  Oh, wow.  So he's calling in the wrong show.  DJ Ang 3, are you going to be calling in?  She's not a Hermaphrodite.  You don't know for sure.  She said she had a boner for Vinny. 
[03:49:00]  I thought we were friends, Sam.  There's no reason.  That's nothing wrong with being an Amaphrodite.  It would probably be inappropriate to say prove it, but not yet.  Do you have a problem with her Hermaphrodites?  I have a problem with the way you do.  We got it.  We're out of here.  Okay, you guys go.  On that note.  Yeah, Who Kid's in battery shape for a long enough?  Simple and gray.  Plus, if I'm telling you.  Simple and gay, I tell you.  Sam, I'm very sorry.  Thank you.  I'm sorry he's been loitering.  Anthony's going to be pissed that there was black people in the studio for as long as  he's been in here.  He doesn't like that.  No, I'm really out of here.  Yeah. 
[03:49:30]  Top of the room, she has dimples, so ask her about that.  You have dimples.  Tell me about this.  What do you mean ask her about that?  Experience in the mouth.  Oh, is that what that...  Oh, boy.  Come on.  That's from sucking cheeks in and stuff?  Who Kid leaves?  It was great.  It was great to be joined by you again.  Who Kid leaves?  I'm sorry about his behavior.  You understand that's not coming from me.  I know, Sam.  Well, listen, I'm glad that you got to meet Vinny today.  Jerry Springer was also on.  Do you have any sort of sexual fantasies about Jerry Springer? 
[03:50:00]  Not so much.  Jerry Springer might be the perfect guest for the Opie and Anthony show because in one  minute, he's talking about the dominatrixes on his show, and the next minute, he's arguing  with Ant about politics, and that is this show.  Like, that is completely every aspect of this show.  E-Rock, is Jerry Springer the perfect guest?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you hear?  No follow-up, just yeah.  No.  You already said it. 
[03:50:30]  It's great.  Every time he comes on, we talk about the trash that's on his show, and then it just dives  into how he's ultra-liberal, and it hates him.  It's amazing the way the elements that make up this show are the elements that make up  Jerry Springer's personality.  The other thing I wanted to talk about, DJ Ang3 on Twitter.  Today, you saw Opie's beard for the first time.  I did.  You noticed.  Was that the first thing you noticed about Opie?  No.  What was the first thing?  Was it the...  Did you notice that his...  I have to be honest.  I was just focusing on Vinny.  Did you notice on Opie, like, he has very cut abdominals, and they come down in like 
[03:51:00]  a very defined V?  He's in very good shape.  Is that what you noticed?  Yes.  Yes.  We all notice it here on the show.  I'm going to have to come back tomorrow morning.  You should come back and look, and if you ever see Opie in person, check out the abs, because  his V is out of this world.  But you notice he had a giant beard.  Yes.  He started growing it to kind of be obnoxious.  And he said, off the air today, I'm going to expose him, he said during commercial that  his beard, he said, this beard is starting to get too much, but I'm in too deep now. 
[03:51:30]  I can't shave it.  Sex Bagel, who was the one who said they wanted Opie to grow the beard long enough until  it became a large enough investment that he couldn't shave it?  That was said right here, was it not?  Sex Bagel, back me up.  Sorry.  One of the management came in.  Who was it?  Who was it?  Rob Cross.  Oh, come on.  Throw him on the air when he comes in.  He loves it.  I'm sorry, Sam.  I heard that important beard question while I was talking to Eric. 
[03:52:00]  I don't know why he couldn't do two things at once.  We both know why, Eric.  I mean, Eric can barely do one thing at once.  But who said it, Eric?  Was it me?  Yeah, you said it.  I said it.  I told you it would happen.  That's what happened to me.  DJ Ang3, you see how long my hair is, right?  Yes.  Like, it's past the point of no return.  I don't see a point in my life where I would cut it.  Because it's like, it's just been too long.  That's my identity.  Opie's sticking with the beard.  And he's going to get to a point where he cannot cut it.  You know?  It's going to be like a problem. 
[03:52:30]  He can't shave it.  There he is.  Wow.  Stand out of the meeting.  Okay.  Well, you have fun in your meeting.  Thanks.  That's DJ Ang3.  Get out, DJ.  Get out.  She has a crush on Vinny from the Jersey Shore.  Well, who can blame her, huh?  He's a hunk.  He is.  That's what the girls say these days.  He's a hunk and he's a looker.  He's a real stud.  I wish you had been in here.  I just interviewed Brian Fankhart. 
[03:53:00]  It went so much better than the Tom Papa thing.  Well, what happened with Fankhart?  What's he promoting?  Fankhart.  Yeah.  He's got an album.  It's on iTunes called Simple and Gray.  Why wouldn't he just call it Fankhart?  I don't know.  He always makes things more difficult.  Bigger news.  Yeah.  Opie announced it on the show today.  Brett.  This conversation we're having right now is a prelude because tomorrow, Ron Bennington  makes his return to the Opie and Anthony show.  I am.  I'm coming in to hang out with the boys. 
[03:53:30]  And you're doing that to meet Mick Foley, right?  Because I heard Mick Foley was going to be on the show and you were a fan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That must be what it is.  It is all about Mick Foley.  What time is he coming in?  I think he'll probably be in during the 8 o'clock hour.  Mick is kind of a regular.  Yeah.  He's one of the few wrestlers that they'll allow to keep coming in.  Well, he's not a normal guy.  No.  He's very strange.  In terms of wrestling.  Oh, I think he's spent in general.  No.  He's a strange dude, too. 
[03:54:00]  Well, the best people are.  He's also trying to be a comedian now.  He's an aspiring comedian.  So, he's got that going for him.  Unmasked!  You want to unmask Mick Foley?  No, I want to unmask Dude Love.  Oh.  Or Mankind.  And see if Mick Foley's under that.  That's where you get...  It'd have to be a three-parter because you'd have to get through all the layers.  You know, Dude Love was my all-time favorite.  He was your favorite Mick Foley alter ego?  I think he might be just my favorite American.  He's just your favorite person.  Yeah. 
[03:54:30]  Mick Foley wrote in his book that he never understood why the Dude Love character was  a hippie in tie-dye that came out to 70s Bee Gees music.  I have no problem with it.  You liked it.  Yeah.  You liked the angle.  But even more importantly than Mick Foley again, Ron, do you have anything big planned  for tomorrow?  You're just going to be hanging?  Yeah.  I'm just going to be hanging.  I'm just going to hang out.  I don't know.  Because I know you.  And you like to plan something huge.  You're a showman.  You like to plan.  There'll probably be some kind of big entrance. 
[03:55:00]  Right.  Some kind of prop.  I don't know what it's going to be, but I can't wait to see.  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, this is something people do in what I like to call  show business to fuck up somebody's entrance.  This is because when I have my club and I used to bring up Brian Regan, I would always  do this to him.  I go, ladies and gentlemen, this next comedian is the funniest man in the world.  I guarantee you, think of the funniest person you know.  This guy is even funnier.  I go, his first five minutes, you'll be gasping for breath. 
[03:55:30]  Trust me on this.  Be ready to lose it.  Some people, though, don't do that.  And if that happens, he'll probably never get you back.  So pay really attention to whether you think this is tremendously funny or not funny at all.  And I try to give him an intro that he just couldn't possibly follow.  And that's what you're doing with me.  Ron, I don't think any intro that I give you is one that you couldn't follow. 
[03:56:00]  We're talking about me versus you.  It's not exactly a battle of equals here.  You.  Well, first of all, let me just say this.  You're lucky that even when we're an Excel channel, I don't use gay slurs or African-American  slurs.  You refuse.  Because I'd be dropping them right now.  So I'm glad that you have a moral compass and can't wait to see you on the O&A show  tomorrow.  Stay tuned.  You coming in?  Huh?  I'm going to be here straight up beginning 1030.  Let's go.  We started at six.  That's a little early.  Yeah. 
[03:56:30]  We'll find out what time Ron shows up tomorrow when the Opie and Anthony show.  Stop trying to do a segue every second.  Continue.  No, it's not every second.  It's just this second.  But you keep interrupting.  So I got to restart it.  It just seems like, why does he got to put a bow around it?  Because I want everything to be wrapped up nice.  And then we can start your show nice.  It's like, this ends nice.  You start nice.  Real quick.  Did they get their pictures up in the lobby yet?  No.  Because I want to be here on a good mood day.  Yeah.  Although, I think the funner days are the bad mood days.  Just because chaos ensues. 
[03:57:00]  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez comes up next.  We'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook and Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  The fun and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Thank you. </pre>
