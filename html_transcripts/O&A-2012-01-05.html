<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts mocking Twitter and recounting a suggestive tweet.  The conversation veered into their daily routines and alarm clocks, one host mentioning a colleague's daily wake-up call.  They then debated the upcoming presidential election, with one host endorsing Ron Paul, dismissing Romney and Santorum.  The futility of voting for a long-shot candidate was discussed.

A substantial portion of the show was devoted to a scathing critique of TLC's "Hoarding Buried Alive," filled with highly offensive language directed at the family's disgusting living conditions and behavior.  The hosts described the house in graphic detail, focusing on the filth, infestation, and the family's enabling behavior, expressing a violent desire to harm the hoarder.  Similarly strong disgust and anger were directed toward "Toddlers & Tiaras," with one host proposing a "most hateable kid" segment.  The segment concluded with the hosts discussing a gift from Syfy and reading listener "F-U" messages, alongside a brief discussion of one host's impression of another and their use of Skechers Shape-Ups.

The show continued with banter about a game show host's attire and a sexually suggestive listener email referencing Shape-Ups.  This segued into a discussion of E-Rock's YouTube channel, comparing it to Opie's, highlighting videos like "Dancing Guido" and a since-removed Justin Bieber re-enactment.  Significant time was dedicated to E-Rock's "Dr. Claw" video, detailing its production and reception.

A caller, Jose, shared his experience in Iraq and subsequent electrocution resulting in arm loss, which fueled further discussion of E-Rock's video.  The "Most Hatable Kid" segment followed, featuring clips of children, notably "Bob" and Cecilia Cassini, who were subjected to ridicule.  A sponsored segment from Sci-Fi Network ensued, where Opie and Anthony received and consumed a "Temptation is a Beast" caramel box despite instructions.  Amy Schumer then joined the show in studio, discussing her upcoming performance at Caroline's, a GQ photoshoot, and her holiday experiences.

A phone call with Laura and Kim from Revere, Massachusetts, followed.  The conversation, punctuated by crude jokes and sexual innuendo, centered around Laura's sexual encounters, particularly a recent experience with a stranger. Kim joined in, and their Facebook profiles were used to fuel the sexually explicit banter with the hosts.  Amy Schumer participated in this conversation.  Ty West and Sarah Paxton, director and actress from "The Innkeepers," then joined for a brief interview, interspersed with sexually suggestive remarks from the hosts.

An interview with Tim, a filmmaker, and Sarah, an actress from his film "The Innkeepers," followed. They discussed independent film distribution, Hollywood's lack of originality, and their experiences filming "The Innkeepers" in a supposedly haunted hotel.  The conversation included detailed discussions of rape scenes in various films, descriptions of Sarah's experiences filming such scenes, accounts of bizarre occurrences during filming, and references to scatological humor and pornography websites, particularly "Salsa Snack."  Tim mentioned his relation to Bill Paxton and shared anecdotes from other projects.

The show continued with a discussion about a video of Chris Kyle punching Jesse Ventura, one host's anecdote about breaking someone's nose, comments on Amy Schumer, Sarah Paxton, and Ty West, a producer's dislike of women discussing defecation, and Roland's ongoing weight loss struggles, with the introduction of a new life coach, intern Sal, replacing Troy Kwan.  A listener won a copy of Chris Kyle's book.  Side conversations involved other radio personalities, Dylan's Candy Bar, and Opie's destruction of promotional items.

Finally, the show began with the hosts eating donuts and transitioned to a conversation with Roland about a cardio requirement, specifically 20 minutes of cardio, with suggestions offered before the segment ended without resolution, with plans to follow up the next day.  The show concluded with plugs for their Facebook page and broadcast schedule.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Meow, meow, meow, meow! Morning!  Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why am I introducing you?  Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, then don't. 
[00:00:30]  Bill Shatner. Bill Shatner.  We like Bill Shatner.  Bill Shatner.  Ooh, boob news. Boob news?  I just got a tweet from boob news.  What the fuck is boob news?  Twitter's a waste of time, by the way.  What?  Huh?  What?  It is.  It's the only way we communicate with the outside world anymore.  It's a waste of time. We're all tweeting our asses off.  We don't even know if anyone reads our tweets.  And then, what's the fucking endgame?  There should be some kind of endgame.  Oh, yeah, there's no endgame.  This is just an ongoing thing. 
[00:01:00]  It's not the destination.  It's the journey.  Is it?  Yeah, apparently.  At least when you're building a website or something.  Like, oh, the endgame is I've developed something nice here.  You're tweeting.  It just goes somewhere.  You're not even really collecting the tweets.  Just this big conversation with people that you wouldn't really ever talk to.  True.  Yeah.  True dad.  True day.  Well, I can't get the link.  I want to know what boob news gave me today, but...  Is that like...  I mean, hashtags.  Ready?  Yeah.  Sexy self-pick, cute, co-ed, perv, tits, nude, girls, creep shots. 
[00:01:30]  That sounds good.  I'm not even following this person, I don't think.  Boob news.  Where do you find the hashtag?  I literally never look at what's trending.  I never know where to find that.  I never look for it.  No?  Trending topics?  Yeah.  I love hanging out and trending topics and fuck with the people.  That's a lot of fun.  I've never seen it.  Yeah, that's always...  That's certainly a good time.  You know where it is?  No, I don't.  I'm on...  It's that thing over there.  It's the guy. 
[00:02:00]  Go to the guy.  The guy?  Yeah.  The guy.  Go to the guy.  It's like a little guy thing.  Morning, everyone.  How's house things?  Oh, everybody's fine, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Hi, everybody.  Hi.  How are you doing?  You're happy?  Jimmy's never happy.  I'm usually tired, but yeah, I feel good.  Yeah?  Yes.  I slept right to my alarm today.  Fuck.  I never do that.  I have a fail-safe alarm that goes off. 
[00:02:30]  My stupid body wakes me up before my alarm every single morning for whatever reason.  Pre-vacation, I was waking up before the alarm, before even Kenny calls, because Kenny gives  me a morningly call.  Which is a treat, isn't it?  It's a treat.  Oh, my God.  It's a treat.  Well, another day.  All right.  Yes, it is, Kenny.  Thank you.  It's like the Grim Reaper tapping your forehead with his sickle.  That's what I wake up to.  Time to get up.  But I was waking up before that and actually texting Kenny, no need to call. 
[00:03:00]  And he'd be like, okay.  And now he has to call me every day for the past couple of days that we've been in.  I've been asleep.  Right.  And woken up by his, as Jimmy said, sickle tapping me on the forehead.  Hi.  Come on.  How are you?  How are you doing?  Good morning.  There's nothing to say either. 
[00:03:30]  It's like, all right, Kenny.  Thanks.  Okay.  You just hang up and hope you don't fall back to sleep.  Anthony.  Yes.  I'm officially endorsing Ron Paul.  Ron Paul.  Yeah.  I have to.  I have to do it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why not?  Why is that?  Because Santorum's a kook.  Yeah.  We know that.  And Mitch Romney is just not leadership material.  Or Mitt.  Did you say Mitch?  I was going to say Mitch.  Like I said, I just woke up.  His brother, Mitch.  His brother, Mitch. 
[00:04:00]  He's fine, but Mitch is no good.  Oh, maybe that's the problem.  I've been looking at the wrong guy.  I'm looking at this guy, Mitch Romney, going, what's the big deal?  He doesn't look presidential.  Right.  He's hauling garbage somewhere.  Sorry.  Mitt Romney.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like I said, I'm voting for anybody.  I like this Ron Paul.  He had a good interview with Piers Morgan last night.  And I'm thinking to myself, all right.  There's plenty of people.  I like Ron Paul now.  Are good.  Probably make a good president.  Plenty of people that are good.  That's the problem. 
[00:04:30]  That would make a good president that never even runs.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  And don't have that money and support and a party, things like that.  But what are you going to do?  Yeah.  I like Ron Paul, though.  I kind of like Newt for a while.  Yeah.  Newt's going to fuck up your whole party.  You know that, right?  No.  I think Ron Paul will more than Newt once.  But Newt's got to shut up.  Yeah.  Because he knows how to destroy a human being.  Yeah.  But once the nomination is made, all these other people just fall to the wayside.  Joe. 
[00:05:00]  Like, put it this way.  I like Ron Paul to the point where I would vote for him.  I'd endorse him.  I would think, wow, that's good.  But he's not a guy that could beat Obama.  So you don't want to waste your vote?  I don't know.  I'm a big fan of wasting my vote.  Yeah.  Vote waster.  Which usually means not voting at all.  So even though I'm endorsing Ron Paul, I don't know if I'll even pull the lever for the guy.  And get out there and vote for him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well.  Why is Sam laughing?  That's logical. 
[00:05:30]  I'm talking.  I'm saying stuff that the people think in their own heads.  Because you just said I'm endorsing him.  You're encouraging people to vote for him.  Yeah.  But you're not going to vote for him yourself.  But you're like, back.  And you're admitting I probably won't vote for him, but you should.  Sam, so you have so much to learn still, man.  When you have a microphone in front of you, it's very powerful.  So when you say I'm endorsing Ron Paul, now people are going to go out and vote for Ron Paul,  which means I don't have to do anything.  Right.  You don't even have to.  It's like.  Right.  I did my job. 
[00:06:00]  Instead of your one vote, you're now encouraging multiple votes.  So yours doesn't even count anymore.  Right.  That's how it works.  Okay.  I did my job, though.  I'm not just sitting.  It's all back.  It's all about this microphone.  That's right.  Right here in front of us.  Wow.  Yep.  That says it all.  And I came from Connecticut.  Mitch Kumstein Romney.  You know who that was?  Mitch Kumstein.  Did I say Mitch?  What an asshole.  But you got the Michelle Bachman dropping out, right?  And Ned Gingrich.  Ned Gingrich. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Bachman's.  What is she?  Done?  She's done.  She should be.  She should be done.  She's done.  I guess.  I thought she was going to stay in there for a while because she really loves herself.  Oh, she won't go away.  She'll be a pundit.  How do they do that now?  They just kind of go, well, you know, I'm backing out of this thing, but you'll still  see me.  How, though?  They'll be on, like, Fox News.  Oh, really?  She seems an insider now.  Yeah.  She's someone with a valuable opinion. 
[00:07:00]  A Beltway insider.  The Beltway.  You don't like the term Beltway?  I hate when they talk about the Beltway.  And then they name their shows, Inside the Beltway.  The Beltway.  Oh, that must be Washington.  You ever get stuck on the Beltway?  Oh, boy.  Jimmy was with me once.  I did a round and round once.  Did you do a round and round?  Jimmy was with me when I was really bad with my driving and road rage.  Can you give me a map of the Beltway? 
[00:07:30]  Because it was with your ex.  Yes.  I forgot.  Did she get, like, the wrong directions?  I think only did they get the wrong directions.  Yes.  Or something.  I ended up looping around and going back north again, and I was like, what the fuck?  I think the problem with the Beltway, I did a full circle once, because it'll say you're  going north when you're...  He gets the Belt Parkway.  Oh, sorry.  I did a whole loop because it says you're going north.  Yeah.  When you're officially going south.  Yeah.  But the locals, I guess, understand that that... 
[00:08:00]  You know what I mean?  They understand that.  Yep.  But if you only do the Beltway every once in a while, you assume if it says you're going  north or south, whatever, you're going that direction.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I went around the whole thing.  So did I.  It really wasn't fun.  No.  Knowing that I was just like, fuck, man, I could have been there.  It's one thing when you're driving, and it doesn't matter what time you get there  and stuff, it's not as bad.  If you're driving somewhere, and it's late, and you know you've got shit to do in the  morning, and you just want to get to your hotel and go to sleep, and then you realize 
[00:08:30]  now that you've just tacked another 45 minutes, and you would have been asleep in a hotel room  already, oh, it's infuriating.  Anything worse than missing your exit?  Now we could talk to the general populace.  It is infuriating.  And you're like, all right, I missed my fucking exit.  I'll just take the next one.  Oh, boy.  And then all of a sudden, you're driving, and you're driving, and you're driving, and  then it says, next exit, 10 miles, and you're like, holy fuck, I just added like 40 minutes  onto my ride.  Yeah, some places on the Jersey Turnpike, you know, you missed that exit, and you're just 
[00:09:00]  like, oh, my God, no.  Oh, Jesus, no.  Because you know you've got to go that, you've got to go the 10 miles, get off, then get  back on, come back to 10 miles, just to be where you missed your fucking exit.  Long Island Expressway, no problem.  It's half a mile or a mile at most, and you're spun around again.  But you get some of these roads where the exit's next exit, 10 miles, and you miss  your exit.  You're just like, well, there we go.  And then you get off and turn around, and you're like, all right, now I just got to make  up all that time. 
[00:09:30]  And then you get to where you were, and it's like, well, now I'm just back where I started.  This sucks.  And why is that the longest 10 miles of your life?  It's just 10 miles, and if you're going over 70, you know, you can do it in less than  10 minutes.  The odometer does not seem to move.  No.  No.  It's fucking infuriating.  And you just keep looking down, and you only did a 10th of a mile.  Come on, man.  What the fuck?  I should've...  Whatever.  Yeah.  That is angering.  Why are you in a good mood today, Jimmy?  I just am. 
[00:10:00]  I'm doing that Zach roast at the end of the...  What's the Zach roast?  I'm roasting Zach Wilde.  Oh, that's right.  And I'm just very psyched about it, and I'm going over roast jokes.  That is good.  Very cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Very, very, very good.  I'm sure you'll be able to come up with a few humdingers.  I'm going to go up there.  I'm going to go, what are you...  It's a big beard or something.  What are you...  What are you, like, growing hair on the front of your face to turn upside down?  Oh, the laughter will be crazy.  It'll be raucous.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  No shit.  Awful.  It'll be humiliating to bother. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, boy.  Last night was that show, Hoarding Buried Alive.  Not to be confused with Hoarders.  It was Hoarding Buried Alive.  What do you mean?  There's two Hoarders shows on now.  What?  There's Hoarders.  Is it on the same network?  No.  Oh, they're competing with each other.  Yeah.  Okay, go ahead.  Sorry.  And then there's Hoarding Buried Alive.  Last night, and I've said this before, but I absolutely mean it this time. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  The worst fucking one I've ever seen in my life.  The worst Hoarder.  The worst Hoard.  The most disgusting house I've ever seen.  And the most despicable fucking piece of shit mother in this house.  Let me ask you this, because you were just talking about Hoarders a mere two days ago.  Yeah.  And they found a dead body.  So how could this possibly be worse than the guy that was Hoarding so bad there was a dead body in his house?  Because you could have clutter and, like, junk. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  There's a difference between junk and garbage.  Right.  The other house of the dead body was mostly junk.  Okay.  But there were, you know, bottles of urine and things like that, which is disgusting.  Unbelievable.  This is a fat piece of shit mother with two piece of shit kids, but they're kids, you know, they're teens.  Yeah.  And this just worthless, emasculated, castrated, enabling husband.  And the house is full of literally garbage. 
[00:12:00]  Garbage to where the roaches that are running around in this house, it was by the tens of thousands of roaches.  Is that the one we saw the coming attractions for at your house?  And I'm like, I got to watch that.  Yes.  They take the painting off the wall, a picture off the wall, and roaches it behind it.  Even the coming attractions didn't do this justice of how disgusting it was.  She had black widow spiders in the house, too.  A nest of black widow spiders.  Black widow spiders.  And whenever they asked her, you know, and the shrink would ask her, so, you know, why is your house like this? 
[00:12:30]  You know, you have kids.  You have teenage children living here, and this is in a healthy environment.  And, well, they don't do anything.  They, they, no one cleans up.  Why is there a pile of garbage next to your chair that you sit in?  Well, you know, I've, I've asked them to clean this up, and they don't do it.  Why don't you do it?  Well, I have fibromyalgia.  She goes, I have seven or 14 disabilities.  She, she, she, and every disability is one of these fucking, you know, I've Epstein bar. 
[00:13:00]  She needs lead bar over her fat head.  You should only be allowed to have one disability in our country.  It was.  Why, why?  Yeah, yeah.  I like it.  One disability.  And then if you have more, then they, they send you to a home.  This Julie Pike woman here, she's the one that, she's the shrink.  She went in.  Okay.  And she wanted to, to crack this woman over the fucking head.  Oh, you could tell?  Oh, yeah.  She looks, uh, pretty, uh, doable.  It was. 
[00:13:30]  She looks all right.  The bathroom, they had to wear biohazard suits.  This woman's like diabetic.  And she, she had syringes where she just threw them all over the place in the house.  They were laying all over the place.  None of the plumbing worked.  And there were diapers and Kotex, bloody Kotex, all over the bathroom floor.  Oh, my God.  Just shit and piss.  And they're brushing their teeth in these sinks that are backed up with black water.  The, the, the daughter is cooking on one burner of a stove that's, everything's covered in shit. 
[00:14:00]  She's walking barefoot in garbage on the floor and flicking roaches away from what she's trying to cook.  How do you live like that?  I, I have no idea.  And all that was coming out were excuses after excuses as to why things had gotten a little out of hand.  Like literally, she should, and her family should just shoot her.  Yes.  I was like, yeah, the daughter, the daughter cooks for the mother because the mother has, you know, fibromyalgia and can't move. 
[00:14:30]  But she gets up and walks away quick enough when the shrink is talking to her.  The shrink is talking to her.  She goes, I don't have to listen to you and gets out of her fat woman chair and walks away with a dumb cane.  What is that fiber?  Fibromyalgia.  I don't know.  It's, I, I, I'm so lazy that I don't want to do anything.  So I'm going to say my joints hurt.  Oh, it's a joint thing.  I don't know what it is.  Constant pain.  It's all those Pepsi cans.  Pepsi, all of them.  I'm sure, yeah, somebody wrote, I'm sure Pepsi loved their product place for last night. 
[00:15:00]  You know what?  You would have constant joint pains if you're drinking soda all day instead of water.  Oh, God.  Because you're not.  Turn, turn this up.  Here's the.  You're not hydrating your body when you drink soda.  Here's the health department talking about what they're seeing.  They, they were brought in.  Wow.  It's a pile of garbage in the house.  This is bad.  Dramatic music, though.  Yeah, this is the health department, people.  Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.  There's roaches everywhere. 
[00:15:30]  During the day.  Now they're trying to go from room to room, and what you're hearing is them just trotting  through garbage.  They're in the, in the kitchen.  It's just a pile of garbage.  They just throw the garbage right there on the floor.  It is.  Oh, my God.  This is bad.  There's roaches on every pot and pan.  Temporary relief we can do for them.  The problem you've got is that there's just not enough accessible areas to do anything  with it.  Ants.  Well, the ants weren't even, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  Look at this.  It's a, it's, it's a can.  Is that maggots?  Full of roaches.  That's roaches, huh?  I've never seen anything this bad here.  This is bad.  They've never seen anything this bad.  Hold your light.  What a monster.  I want to see how deep these roaches go in this can.  You want to see how deep the roaches go in the can?  It's a can full of roaches.  Oh, my God.  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  Bugs got your tongue?  That's three inches of roaches.  Wow.  Three inches of roaches. 
[00:16:30]  And this wasn't even the, the worst thing.  Like, everything they did just got worse and worse.  I don't like roaches.  She cooks in there.  Roaches are disgusting.  They are so skeevy.  She's barefoot in that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The, uh, the daughter would go barefoot in this.  Is it running?  With the syringes in there, and look at the fridge.  Oh, my God.  Are you serious?  The refrigerator has roaches all inside it.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  That's not a very nice fridge.  No.  They go upstairs, and there's a room where the doors are closed. 
[00:17:00]  I could agree.  Every door.  The doors are closed.  The guy opens the door, and you just see roaches come pouring out of this room.  It's, it was the worst hoarding I've ever seen in my life on, on these shows.  And I, I've pretty much seen them all.  That was, when you see roaches in broad daylight, like, literally, roaches don't want to be  seen by you.  They want to hide.  They're very shy.  That means, they really are.  If you could talk to a roach, you would go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  what is it about roaches you see one roach it skeeves you out man they're so skeevy because i 
[00:17:30]  i was infested with uh mice you know i told the stories over the years before i moved out yeah  uh that didn't bother me as much i killed over 60 or 70 mice in those electric traps just for  the people that don't know this story but what really skeeve me out in my old place was when i  saw a roach every once in a while yeah a roach i think um it's it isn't as bad as like having a  maybe some ants or you see a spider in your house or something like that spider you see a roach 
[00:18:00]  it just it's it's synonymous with filth with like oh god i have roach you have a filthy house more  importantly you're right about all that but i think one roach because we've heard over the years if you  have one oh yeah you have a thousand and if you have one that's out out and about that means you're  infested so then you're just wondering where is the the roach nest where's the rest of them is it  going to be behind a picture is it uh you know uh under the cushion is it you know what i mean  is it under my mattress is it under my bed where are these fucking things i've seen a couple in um 
[00:18:30]  like every every once in a while i'll see a little little baby baby one in my sink in your house yeah  but i i know what that is they come up through pipes oh yeah that doesn't freak me out a little  teeny teeny teeny baby in a in a sink area means it's just you could probably crawl out of the thing  you can't you can't in new york yeah in new york i've never seen anywhere else on this show last  night the daughter is uh talking about the kitchen and how disgusting it is yeah she taps one of the  outlets in the kitchen they love roaches come pouring out of the outlet no yes and and there's

[00:19:30]  and black widow spiders like he's not even there for garbage he's there vacuuming up roaches  sherry i need to talk to you oh here you go here's the fat pig pause pause i i want to i want to set  this up please tell me that they handle these idiots differently than the other show i wish they  did they're competing with uh what what network um oh geez we should know a and a a and a has the  famous hoarder show so tlc's jumping on the bandwagon they got their own hoarding show it's called 
[00:20:00]  hoarding buried alive buried alive and actually we do have uh dr uh robin uh zazio coming in on  monday yeah she's great she's got a book out she's from the other one she's on hoarders yeah  but oh and and she she goes with it because we we kind of joke with her but we're also serious we're  like why are you dealing with these idiots she says and here's her uh what dr zazio said was uh  because we were saying why the fuck don't you just tell these people clean this shit up you're  fucking a disgusting mess right she goes well that's what they hear all the time we're trying 
[00:20:30]  a different approach than just yelling at them and i go and and at the time i was like oh that makes sense  but as i watch this no one gets in their face no one i tweeted last night i go this fucking pig  woman needs like gunnery sergeant hartman in her fucking face to just the second she starts saying  i'm not gonna deal with this fuck you this just get right in her face again and go no you're not  going anywhere right clean this shit up not clean it up i paused it because this is the psychologist 
[00:21:00]  obviously yes and she's gonna talk uh to the woman that's yeah disgusting mess and i'm hoping that  she's gonna be a little tougher but it's all me me me let's hear the me me bullshit hateable  and there is a nest of black widow spiders in there  okay so i'm really concerned about the safety of you and the kids in that house  um it's this is a really disturbing environment it's not safe

[00:22:00]  do this you'll freak out you'll fucking freak out at at how much you want to strangle i want to  strangle this woman yeah i don't feel sorry for her no in the least the psychiatrist the  psychologist is saying look i'm concerned about your kids uh you and your kids in in this environment  and she twists that around into what do you want me to do you're saying that me i am not a good  parent i i would take out her knees with a buick oh would that be great i i can't do this 
[00:22:30]  this me me me shit that a lot of us have dealt with over the years oh it's fucking brutal rage  and she's one of the worst they don't see none of this no no it's all about her and then that lady  how do you how do you do that job where you have to cater to this as a psychologist watch the rest of  this it's it's infusion no no and by the way the mental we trash mental illness the phones always  light up because everybody is sick of these fucking shit from people yes because oh because i think what  is blown off when you have to deal with someone with mental illness in your family is the fact 
[00:23:00]  that it it affects everybody so so logically you should separate that one fucking person to keep  everyone else healthy but no we all have to get quote sick to try to make you better and you don't  even acknowledge what what the sacrifices everyone's making around you yep that's what drives me nuts  infuriating but why as human uh you know having human compassion you can't just separate that one  person to save everyone else yeah get rid of the disease fuck cut out the tumor yeah i have more 
[00:23:30]  respect for a lunatic who just picks up a gun and runs out and shoots a bunch of people because you're  like wow he's fucking nuts yeah he's not sitting there draining everybody yeah and and you know that  this woman this fat pig right here oh that's not nice sorry you're right uh oh oh no oh my sorry  uh she's loving this you're playing right into what she wants yes she wants attention she's hateable 
[00:24:00]  and now she's gonna get up and walk away and now you have to dramatically follow her and oh god never  well yeah here she is walking never again listen to this fucking bitch  oh walked away her husband's just sitting there i don't have to talk to her and i'm not going to  sherry's a very troubled woman and i think she is in a lot of denial about how serious her problem is 
[00:24:30]  what she doesn't sit in her car to herself while everyone else is cleaning her fucking house  that's fucking uh and now they gotta go up and yeah now that's somebody else a worker talking to  sherry they should just burn the house down  i'm trying to make it sound like i made my children live in an unsafe environment  you did  you did you do fatso  you're supposed to take care of your own kids take a look at things how they got the way they are 
[00:25:00]  and kind of internalize it i think that's kind of maybe what jolie's trying to point out to you  too  she's a i don't like her i don't want her around me  okay yeah i have to sit in the van to shrink she doesn't want to shrink around you don't tell me  about myself yeah okay because i don't want you to avoid this situation that we're doing  i'm not avoiding what you're doing okay yes you are you went into a van  it's another way for a fat lazy fuck cannot clean up her own mess clean up your own  clean up fatso  you should have seen the part b you should have seen the part where she goes up to her room 
[00:25:30]  her disgusting hovel lays down in a roach infested bed and and tells the people  i i feel sick i feel sick i can't be down there i can't  are there roaches in the bed oh yeah there's roaches in the bed  she wakes up at one point there's like shit on the pillow and roach shit  no there's not roaches in the bed  yes all over everywhere in the house there are roaches  after she said that i would just turn to my team and go all right pack up pack it up we're 
[00:26:00]  leaving let this piece of shit we're leaving pedigree every pedigree no it's great a little  observation yeah i think it's never good when they bring out the red garbage bags it's a biohazard  yeah they they had they're like hefty bags obviously that we all know but the red ones  they're their dark red color you know that's not good the house is a biohazard because of the fecal  matter the blood bloody cotex on the floor and the syringes the hundreds of syringes that this woman  said i had a box for sharps but i don't know what happened to it so uh i just started putting them in the 
[00:26:30]  garbage pile yeah that's great see you know you're in bad shape when people cleaning your house  are dressed the same as people who are cleaning up fucking three mile island and the nuclear spill in  japan yes fukushima whatever they're dressed like the same way those people are dressed  your house is a shithole no one should ever be in your house dressed like that unless it's halloween  i do feel bad for the teenagers though because it's like you're raised in this it's like what do you 
[00:27:00]  do they show them yeah they they did show the the fat ugly daughter cooking and and what do you want  mom i want three eggs no and then she's cooking her eggs in the roach infested kitchen i was like i'd  poison the food if i was the daughter it's poison it put this fat pig down jesus she's a terrible  mother oh horrible and everything was about her yeah you're telling me i you know she's telling me i  didn't take care of my kids and had them live in in roach infested house look at yes you did oh it's 
[00:27:30]  it makes my fucking head yeah hurt how how angering i know why it bothers me why does it bother jimmy so  much because of me too the lack of ability for them to see it there's a different there's definitely a  different level of uh of being annoyed by this i want to punch her in the face because of how she is  like as a uh she she doesn't see but you're not see her you're not connected to it you just see it as  like a just a disgusting human being but there's something in jimmy's voice that i recognize and it 
[00:28:00]  really bothers i don't know deeper level i i think it just hits us in a very weird way that there is  when when you're i'm not always self-aware but i try to be self-aware i try but to see the lack of  awareness and certain people i've dealt with in my life uh let's just say in the last few years  who have had this me me me shit yeah and i wanted to pick up a rifle and shoot them well maybe that's  it uh i've i've grown to hate them yeah and i have no empathy and no sympathy and i'm tired of only 
[00:28:30]  hearing empathetic things from from people and they only want to hear you speak about them in an  empathetic tone right they don't want to you never hear these people come out and go god i am a  selfish pig yeah and that's why we hate them and they're never going to do that but you just want  them to give you just slight awareness of what's going on they don't even give you a slight awareness  like oh i realize my problems are really affecting a lot of people around me it's always the same thing 
[00:29:00]  with this show too the the fat pig and then they they just cannot find enough people to blame  and they have these enablers around them that just won't get in their face and say you know this  woman's getting up and walking around she's walking away from the shrink she looked fine walking to the  vehicle and sitting down but the second they say we want you more involved in this process of cleaning  up she all of a sudden my fibromyalgia my epstein bar my i'm nauseous like this that there's a thousand 
[00:29:30]  excuses and and why is the place a mess it's nothing to do with her meanwhile she's sitting in this chair  this throne of shit in the middle of her fucking living room with one of those things that cripple  people use to reach items that are too too high up on a shelf she's got one of those of course she  does and it's used because occasionally the mountains of garbage fall into her little zone  she picks it up and flings the garbage into a pile instead of like cleaning and then blames the 
[00:30:00]  daughter and the son for not having cleaned this mess up and the husband the husband is also hateable  yes but it's not like like if i lived with angelina jolie and she was that messy i would tolerate it  like i'd eat her pussy and i'd brush the roaches away but when you're a fat monster like that what is  wrong with this husband yep not defending his children you kind of said it wrong to me you would brush  the cockroaches away to eat the pussy oh yes i would yes yes you'd have to brush some black widow 
[00:30:30]  spiders yeah off the pussy before you eat it you'd hear eat my pussy all right fine  and then hearing them scurry away up her abdomen around they'd crawl around and then go up her  asshole because they're always looking for somewhere to go well let's get into this for a moment  would you would you smell a hoarder's uh pussy oh god no never what do you think it smells like  uh garbage um fecal matter fecal matter garbage is easy to smell a tart pungent you would tolerate  you would tolerate smelling garbage no oh no no no what no you've smelled garbage before you 
[00:31:00]  yeah but not on a pussy jeez that really that really brings it home doesn't it yeah yeah fair  enough fair enough fair enough fair enough sir fair enough yeah it's uh you have to add the word  sour in there too sour it'd be a very sour smelling pussy the uh the children are always to blame and  they just are are uh put in a situation where of course it ruins any type of social life that they 
[00:31:30]  should probably be having the children are always to blame oh oh i was saying the children are always  to blame like that that's the mindset of the yeah yeah i got this little hot guy no you helped me  into the water yeah yeah oh yeah no he helped me he pushed me and remember that episode where hawkeye  kept itching because he smelled the moldy clothes yes what happens in your brain that you become a  hoarder because in my house uh since i've had a kid you know we got a couple little piles here and  there and i can't i can't take it no i have to get rid of the dumb little piles nothing you know like 
[00:32:00]  maybe a little mail piling up some old magazines crap like that and i it i lose my mind like no we  got to fucking make sure this pile doesn't get any bigger right now i do understand the mindset like  we've talked about this before but how because i collect things and i do get the idea of i can't throw  this out i i like that irrational that's all i can describe it as it's like reaching for something  hey no no no i need it but to let it get to that point where it's garbage i just i don't comprehend 
[00:32:30]  but i get the mindset of of i need to save this i need to keep this for collectibles sam i think you  do too you collect wrestling shit you know what though in the end you only need probably your phone  my uh in my life my phone my camera your picture of me and my picture with jim norton and and my  macbook that's all you need in life everything else is garbage really i'm a little guilty when it  comes to uh collecting shit collecting uh electronics like i have a hard time throwing away 
[00:33:00]  um old electronics old electronics that and the thing is when i when i put them somewhere  they're not completely outdated but then a year later when when you're going through something  and then you see like oh christ a box of fucking old shit that that is i'd never use this anymore  and instead of throwing away i just kind of shut the box out of sight out of mind  i have no aversion whatsoever to throwing it away but i'm just like eh why bother well you got enough 
[00:33:30]  space yeah that's just if you lived in new york man it would be a different story get rid of  room start filling up quick no i don't have a trs 80 yeah tandy from the tandy corporation what's  the rule if you haven't used it or worn it in a year yeah just throw it away yeah and you'll never  miss it there there was a scene in the hoarder episode last night where uh the shrink comes out  or some woman comes out and she's holding this wicker basket thing and she goes i wanted to run this 
[00:34:00]  past you uh do you want to keep this and she's looking at and she's like no no i'll just  you know i'll just have my mother come out of the grave and make a new one like and it's like  if it was and then she goes well there's roaches and roach eggs all over it because yeah well just  throw it away get rid of it then get rid of it and it's like if it meant so much to you that your  mother made this fucking thing that you don't want to throw it away and you're giving snide-ass  remarks to the person trying to help you perhaps you would have treated it a little better and not 
[00:34:30]  let roaches nest in it you fucking slob we watch more of this woman i i it affects me in a weird  way that's it fuck all they don't post all of us that's smart when will we have the whole episode  uh i mean we might have to find it someplace yeah find some clips at some point that is  enraging it was i i was i i was tweeting last night and people were infuriated because they  start watching and we just start like tweeting what's going on and how it's it's just pissing 
[00:35:00]  everybody off and uh you'd be amazed how many people just want to wanted to literally kill this  woman why because i'm telling you it's too close to home yeah everyone has someone in their life  and the only way to handle them get really frustrated by abandon them totally oh yeah  abandon abandon them abandon i mean that's harsh but i i think that to not allow them to affect you  they have to be abandoned and just left to do whatever they want in their own faith yeah i 
[00:35:30]  completely agree with you but you know it's it let's acknowledge it's not the easiest thing that's  very hard oh here's it's hard very hard another despicable part of this woman i totally forgot about  this yes the husband by the way doesn't live in the house he lives somewhere else  and why is that because the place is a fucking mess he finally had yeah yeah he he bailed he lives  in another house he probably has a hot they're 22 year old i doubt it they're estranged from each  other yeah she has custody of the kids will not let the kids live with the father because she gets 
[00:36:00]  money for having the two kids and being on disability and she wants people to take care of her right  and she needs the people to take care of her and she she pockets the money well fuck the husband he  probably doesn't want the kids with him because how could you not just go to court with a photo and  go this is where you're living yeah fuck the father and fuck the system for allowing that well that's just  it yeah you could be able to do that look she you know she got away with it oh you almost can't blame 
[00:36:30]  her well by the end of the episode she's um the house is uh not uh cluttered anymore i won't say  clean and they're all eating together the the daughter had had cooked something on the stove now  that had four burners and and all the tweets that were coming in where i wouldn't i still wouldn't eat  sleep shit or stand in that fucking hovel you do know that there's no way the roaches are gone  no they probably had to uh go all right uh action yeah every time a roach ran out they had to stop 
[00:37:00]  shooting people were even saying well uh you know well most of the bugs seem to be gone and uh and  then the woman by the shit chair they didn't get rid of her shit chair that's probably smells like a  fat ass uh and right next to it these boxes of fucking pepsi uh i was gonna say we had started  already piling up what what a great way to end the episode where the dishes are in the sink and you  hear someone in the in the background going ah we'll get to that later i'll leave them soak and 
[00:37:30]  then you do a nice dramatic close-up zoom in to the dishes in the sink with and and one roach crawling  on it and then it ends uh yeah right on me it was infuriating i was too busy trying to figure out  this uh gop bullshit and you're watching horrors oh it was great i love how they do they they tread that  line between hating the person for what a fucking prick they are and what a disgusting mess they are  and the skeeve of the house itself you know so you hate the person and then you get the 
[00:38:00]  heebie-jeebies watching the uh show uh so these hoarder shows are great and it's and once again it's  just uh sideshow shit oh it is absolutely that's all it is they're not really trying to help anybody  they had the premier they believe they are because you know yeah yeah that's people would be  always helping that this would be on tv but and then toddlers and tiaras had their little new show  last night uh and watching that was another thing that was just like how is this allowed the parents 
[00:38:30]  should be just just the kids should be taken away they're feeding a mountain dew and pixie sticks  and and and yelling at the kid that they have to get you got to get your energy up you got to bring  your a game what you doing what are you doing the kids like i don't want to do this and remember  when john benet ramsey got killed and everybody was like uh yeah we didn't know about the toddlers  and tiaras so much before that exactly you saw john benet and everyone was horrified at the way she  was dressed right in her stripper cowboy outfit right uh and now that horrified thing that people were 
[00:39:00]  has turned into this curiosity of the freak show that is toddlers and tiaras and you just watch  these kids put in situations that they shouldn't be put in put in clothes that they shouldn't be put  in at one point the the mother's walking her kid down the the hallway of this hotel this motel  this shitty fucking days in or whatever and uh she goes i like the way those fish nets look on you 
[00:39:30]  and the girl the little girl actually said to the mother she goes i think they're inappropriate  really kid said that really it was like what the fuck no it would be a good show because toddlers and  tiaras or these these type of shows have been around a while now right at least 10 years not 10 years  no come on i think we start talking about this at any w uh we've been back on radio seven years already  that was kid modeling on the web we had talked about that which was uh really a guise for pedophilia 
[00:40:00]  because it was just well young girls dressed in scantily clad outfits well the show that they  should do is find some of these little girls that are now grown up oh i'm sure you could find some  yeah where they're you know 18 19 20 years old now yeah and see how their how their lives are if they  were affected by all this craziness yeah i'm looking forward to next week's uh toddlers and tiaras uh  mckenzie makes a return uh that's the crazy uh kid really you bat drive me nuts what about uh bob 
[00:40:30]  i wanna win a crayon crying any kid taking a face plant or crying is hilarious on that show and  i'm gonna challenge you bob that little piece of shit i'm gonna challenge you today oh after the  break yeah i'm gonna give you some time most hateable kid most hateable kid on what just in  general whatever in anything yeah you've watched enough toddlers and tiaras you can pick out one of  them uh i got one bob i hate bob bob is the most hateable who's bob bob is one of the few boys that 
[00:41:00]  are in the pageants yeah uh there was another boy that was in the pageant that was doing ballet  really why don't we play hateable why don't we play most hateable kid after the break you got one  jimmy i i say bob bob well that's not cool that's what bob stinks bob bob is hateable all right i got one  too we're gonna we're gonna see who uh found the most hateable kid yeah i already know we did bob  no one's more hateable than bob i don't know oh man i might lose i don't know bob do you have that 
[00:41:30]  mckenzie um uh it's like a montage did they did they have that no yeah she's on next week's episode and  each one you know these kids i've seen mckenzie they're such kids that uh by the time they're in  another episode enough time has gone by where they're a little older yeah and they're just  mckenzie yeah mckenzie's hilarious though to watch can i because she just is such a brat 
[00:42:00]  you know uh i gotta write this to it oh what uh just talk for a second pause that  so when they're this young though place they're brats but it's it's a hundred percent piece of  shit parents oh yeah yeah oh fuck yeah the kid doesn't know what the fuck they're doing she's  doing she's at least cute bob was ugly and hateable oh yeah yeah yeah definitely oh yes you you notice  that yeah it does look like a child version of my ex-wife oh that's why maybe oh horrid maybe you 
[00:42:30]  really hate her oh yeah in the eyes especially some of this listen to some of the shit yeah i even know  mckenzie it's hilarious the crown falls off her head  she just starts screaming  i can do whatever i want she is an only child of course is the despicable mother 
[00:43:00]  yeah that's all you really need i love her imagine having to deal with that oh it's it's  funny as fuck to watch that but then it gets to the point where it's like all right now dress her  in fucking hot pants and parade around on a stage like the parents and the fathers usually just sit  back and they're normally emasculated and let the fat um living vicariously through the daughter 
[00:43:30]  mothers uh just get away with murder with these kids you look like the parents television council  the uh the ptc they always go after content on tv yeah why why are they not uh going after this is  what pedophiles are jerking off to of course but they're worried about uh somebody having salty  language on dexter on a dumb sitcom last night's toddlers they uh had a woman a woman a kid that  was they wanted to put meat on her like they were trying to put pieces of meat on her to make her look 
[00:44:00]  like lady gaga but uh they couldn't get enough meat on her in time so they pulled the meat off put  her in a lady gaga outfit uh with the sides exposed and everything and a big blonde wig and then  carried her out in what was supposed to be like an egg and it fell over sideways and she just rolled  down it's fucking hilarious all right we're going to play most hateable kid next maybe we'll get a  few uh from the listeners as well i got one yeah i think i think we've played mine over over the years  but i got one i don't know who yours is i know i like that i got a whole bunch of our grub and 
[00:44:30]  speaking of uh the hoarder's pussy uh tex punch him writes it would smell like a boat ramp dumpster  wow those are bad holy fuck boat ramp dumpsters that's where you put the heads of the blue fish  that's pretty bad stuff when you get a few fish i still think daughters of hoarders um are such easy  lays usually you don't want to uh because they're fat like their moms and just slovenly but sometimes 
[00:45:00]  you get one and you're like oh okay and they would be so easy you just in school you find out  she's a hoarder and you go up and say uh hey you know oh you know that's a shame why don't you come  to a clean house and youth my dick youth chubb youth chubb isn't as bad oh of course as older fat  chubb with youth behind it not as bad as old fat yeah yeah and the only thing by the way worse than a  hoarder is somebody in a mansion who looks at a hoarder and says wow i'll bet their daughter would suck my  dick in my clean living room yeah that's terrible that's called really not getting the message of 
[00:45:30]  the program and ants acting has gotten way better because his outrage over toddlers and tiaras is  wow i almost believable at this point outrage i almost believe that he means what he's saying  and that's why he's watching this show terrible oh god uh why don't we uh break  and we'll do most hateable kid and i don't know there's plenty to do there was something else but

[00:50:00]  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  Oh, sexy.  That wasn't a good good morning from you.  What's wrong?  Good morning.  You're mad because I took that dumb shot earlier?  No.  Sam, a lot of people kind of like the fact that you called E-Rock out on wanting to sort of follow my lead on a bunch of things. 
[00:50:30]  This single white female thing?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was listening to that on the shit show on the way home yesterday.  He's got blondish hair like me now.  He was growing a beard until you called him out on it.  And then he felt like he had a shave.  He shaved last night?  Yeah.  Have you had the Skecher shoes, the shape-ups?  Well, the shape-ups. 
[00:51:00]  I swear to you, but I can't convince these assholes out there.  I wear them every once in a while.  Okay, so you do have them, though.  But I do have them.  And they are featured in one of my videos, Mr. Hot Dog.  Okay, that's right.  But people think because they saw it in one of my videos that I wear them all the time.  That's what E-Rock thinks.  He saw it in Mr. Hot Dog, and he started wearing Skecher shape-ups.  You got Skecher shape-ups?  Look, let's not get carried out of hand here.  I have a pair.  But he only wears them every now and then, just like you. 
[00:51:30]  Ah.  Sound off like you got a pair.  I know I'm getting older because Brother Wee's turned me on to the shape-ups.  He's in his 60s.  Oh, boy.  And then I bonded with William Shatner when he walked in with shape-ups.  Shape-ups?  And he's got to be, what, 80-something now?  Yes.  What are you wearing as shape-ups?  And I'm thinking then, I'm just talking to the youth of America and going, oh, that's  something I should get into.  No.  They're kind of cool, though, because you just rock back and forth, and you never get achy  legs when you're just standing around. 
[00:52:00]  Those are terrible.  Oh, God, no.  Have you tried them?  No.  They're amazing, especially when you do a lot of walking.  When you're talking on your jitterbug phone?  I know.  My jitterbug.  But when you're standing around, instead of, like, you know, just standing on your heels,  you kind of just slightly rock, and it keeps your legs nice and fresh.  Retards rock.  I know.  I know.  And the word you used was cool.  Oh, you know what?  The problem with shape-ups, yeah, they don't look cool at all, but they definitely feel good.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, those are shape-ups?  I'm talking.  No, okay.  Yeah.  Shape-ups are shoes that don't have a heel.  Oh, God.  Look at that.  That's what I got.  The S stands for shit.  That's what they look like.  That is one step away from, like, the shoes Jimmy wore in Seinfeld with the big base that  make you jump higher.  Oh, right, right.  That big retard shoe.  But mine don't look like that.  That's like a girl's shoe.  I got cool, like, boots.  You're supposed to be able to wear them instead of working out.  Let me see.  I'll show you mine, and you guys can tell me if they're cool or not. 
[00:53:00]  That's not my shoe either.  Hey, I kind of like them.  Yeah, it makes you tall.  Oh, yeah.  Put an extra couple inches on.  Shape up.  Go back.  My shoe is the one right in the middle.  That's the one I get.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that looks cool.  No, it doesn't.  Oh, boy.  Looks like a hovercraft.  Does it freak you out at all when E-Rock starts kind of taking on your physical attribute?  He doesn't have the V going on, of course. 
[00:53:30]  There's a rumor he might adopt a blonde-headed kid, too, I'm hearing.  I heard that.  His hair's getting very platinum these days.  It's really atrocious.  That white, what does that remind me of?  It's just awful.  Prince Valiant?  Yeah, Prince Valiant.  Prince Valiant.  What?  This Prince Valiant hair.  Great.  He is royalty.  Yeah.  Yes, we forgot.  The royal seed. 
[00:54:00]  He looks like Guy Fieri with that stupid hair.  Yeah, you know, my little pear tarts are delicious.  I rock and roll.  All right, good.  You don't like Guy Fieri?  I love the guy.  Don't bring up Guy Fieri in front of Sam.  Sam hates Guy Fieri.  I don't like Guy Fieri.  Why?  Just because he forced you to drink.  Yeah.  Out of principle.  What?  Out of the principle of it.  Yes.  It was disrespectful, and it was a dickhead move.  He didn't know you didn't drink at all.  Yeah, he did.  We told him.  Light, flaky crust.  Kicks butt.  He's an asshole. 
[00:54:30]  It's cooking.  It's not that extreme, you know?  Yeah, you get a pear tart, and you get a light, flaky crust, and you throw a couple of pears in there,  and it's a tart.  It's just your party.  They're going to go bananas for it.  They're going to go nuts.  Dresses like Steve C.  Like, it's cool.  Like, it was ever cool to wear fire on your clothes.  Yeah.  Cooks with it.  You take these chicken wings.  You throw a little Jack Daniels in there, a little pineapple.  It's nuts.  It's going to make your party extreme.  Are they?  It's going to go ballistic.  You forgot the are they part. 
[00:55:00]  I love what you're doing.  Are they?  Jesus.  Really?  He dials his hair like he was going to a Papa Roach concert.  What?  Boom.  You just take that.  A little splash.  A little splash of spice.  Bow.  A little Jack Daniels.  Boom.  We're partying, brother.  It's crazy.  A little pear tart.  Light, delicious, airy crust around it.  It's crazy.  What?  You don't like when your chef wears risky business shades when he's cooking?  I just don't get the extremeness of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, he's coming at you. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  I like the Guy Fieri.  I like Guy Fieri, too.  I like when chefs wear multiple bracelets.  Sam has a real hatred, though.  We're just fucking around.  Sam hates the guy.  Yeah, I don't like him.  Just because he made you eat delicious steak?  I don't care about the steak.  You take the steak, you cook it well done, you throw a little spice on there, a little  vanilla bean ice cream, pow, your party's out of control.  It's crazy.  Put a little fire on your shirt.  Look at him.  He's not cool. 
[00:56:00]  What do you mean he's not cool?  He's got the flame shirt.  A lot of our listeners wear flame shirts, fucking Sam.  Well, you know, I mean, people who host game shows on NBC are just crazy and extreme.  Oh, insane.  Minute to Win It?  I love the show.  Yeah, it's great.  He's a good host for that, too.  He's not.  You got a minute to win it.  I've never seen it.  Minute to Win It.  I'm guessing that's how he says it.  Yeah.  Kind of like it.  Why does it always have to go to gay?  Noodles Nabula from South Jersey writes, because I said I wear the shape-ups every once in a while.  He writes, do you take a donger in the butt once in a while? 
[00:56:30]  That's the progression, isn't it?  You lace up your shape-ups and then you bend over and take a big cock in your ass.  Well, he says a donger.  A donger.  It's funny.  A donger.  If you admitted you took a donger in the ass, how long do you think it would be before E-Rock came in and said, hey, I just happened to take a donger in the ass?  I just took a donger, yeah.  Oh, you think he'd go to that extent?  He likes Hopi.  He really does.  He's a fan.  I don't feel that.  I don't feel like he likes me.  Oh.  He does.  We all see it.  I don't feel like he does. 
[00:57:00]  And he only shaves a beard because we called him out on it.  Yeah, because it was more than just a little weekend growth.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He wants to be you.  He was trying to get something going with his own beard.  Yeah, he was.  And by the way, and somebody also tweeted me that E-Rock Radio on YouTube came after.  Oh, right.  Not before, after Opie Radio on YouTube.  Opie Radio, E-Rock Radio.  That's the name of your YouTube channel?  The only reason I'm Opie Radio on all this shit is because someone grabbed Opie, and it wasn't even the Ron Howard guy. 
[00:57:30]  Wait, you're E-Rock Radio?  Yes.  Why, no one had E-Rock.  Yeah, they do.  There's some black DJ out west that has that name.  And rock.  Anyway, Sexy, why did you play Bruce Springsteen, Blinded by the Light, which everyone knows is a Man for Man song.  Man for Man's Earth Band.  I think Springsteen did it first, though, right?  Oh.  But everyone knows it as a Man for Man song.  Did Springsteen do it first? 
[00:58:00]  I think so, yeah.  He wrote it.  Yeah.  Well, he could have wrote it, but...  Wait, wait, wait.  No, this...  No.  Where's the rolling?  This is...  Bruce Springsteen wrote Blinded by the Light.  This is 76?  Is it?  Man for Man made the song incredibly famous.  Right.  And I'm not sure if then Springsteen put out his own version afterwards.  Yeah.  That I don't know.  Ah.  Thumbs up for what?  I was just watching E-Rock Radio videos.  Yeah.  And he just has one called Dancing Guido. 
[00:58:30]  Well, you only thought that was going to go viral, didn't you?  Yeah, that's why I promoted it.  Whoa!  What a little face action from the sex man.  Who is the Dancing Guido, by the way?  I was at some party on Long Island, and they had just a DJ there to get the crowd going.  And this guy just starts coming out of this wooden gazebo and dancing by a pool.  That does look like a Long Island fucking shit party.  Oh, it was.  It was a big party with a chain-link fence on every direction and balloons hanging from it.  E-Rock thought that was going to go viral. 
[00:59:00]  And if you'll notice, he wanted to take it to the next level because he didn't like the  criticism that his intros and outros got the last time we played E-Rock Radio videos.  And so he didn't put it in on this one.  Because that one was uploaded through the phone.  Oh, right.  The intros.  Which one of his intros?  I never saw one.  Yeah, you did.  No, you didn't.  You've done this before.  Remember these?  This is the one that also didn't quite go viral.  Roland's singing.  That's got almost 2,800 views.  That's good.  I want to have Jesse's girl. 
[00:59:30]  I want to have Jesse's girl.  Roland's singing.  You can find a woman like that.  That's a cool.  E-Rock Video.  It's his outro.  Did you notice it?  It's his outro.  His face is on the character.  What is that?  That's not Super Mario.  No.  It's just Mario. 
[01:00:00]  Mario Brothers.  How did he get the...  Why did you say Mario again?  That's how people say it.  How does he get the cartoon face on there?  Coke Logic made it.  Oh, Coke Logic.  Oh.  Eric.  You don't think Eric, E-Rock Radio was a little sort of like, oh, he's doing some videos.  Maybe I could put some videos out.  It is.  Opie Radio, E-Rock Radio.  Come on.  I like how I was told, why aren't you doing any of that?  So I tried some, oh, this is complete horse shit.  So I stopped doing it.  And then like, how come you're not doing videos?  Oh, you're ripping me off.  Just keep the list going. 
[01:00:30]  Can I see another viral video?  Jimmy, why are you so annoyed by the outro?  Just awful.  This one was good.  I got to admit.  This one should have went fucking viral.  I got to stick up for E-Rock.  Yeah.  Pause this.  This one's called, Justin Bieber gets nailed by a water bottle.  Re-enactment.  Well, you know why it didn't go viral?  Why it doesn't have view counts?  Why?  Because Steve C. made him take it down multiple times.  Yeah, Steve grabbed me and pushed me into a wall saying, this will be removed now. 
[01:01:00]  Why?  He threatened legal action.  He did.  Yes, didn't he?  Yeah.  Basically, what we're seeing is good old Steve in his office, and he gets hit in the head  by a water bottle.  He has no idea that the water bottle was coming.  The guy set it up.  Who threw the bottle?  Me.  E-Rock.  From where?  From my desk?  Yeah.  Okay.  Right in the head.  Man, that got him right in the head.  No, I didn't go viral.  You don't get his reaction.  Why did you stop filming at that point? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  It hits him in the head.  Yeah, he just looked around and picked it up and put it on the desk, so there was no  reaction.  Can I see the intro and outro?  I want to see it.  Did you have more videos of the intros and outros?  Oh, Sal, you're my best fucking friend today, brother.  Give me that fucking coffee.  Give yourself a raise.  What happened to the other videos?  There was one with Roland by a fireplace.  Yeah, what happened to it?  It's gone.  What?  It's gone.  What did that happen?  Oh, look at E-Rock.  Now E-Rock's got, he has to make believe that, what? 
[01:02:00]  What happened here?  Yeah, he didn't take it down because we made fun of him.  He probably did.  He goes, hold on.  I'm like, I got to investigate.  You either know, you know that it was taken down.  You know, Opie does his man on the street stuff.  That's your shit.  That's my shit.  Uh-oh.  Street vids.  A year ago.  I didn't do a street video.  Yes, you did.  You tried to interview the real life Dr. Claw, and you have three parts.  Part one.  Oh, yeah, because that guy had no arm.  It was all robotic.  He was just standing out on the street.  All right, well, don't make it like it's obviously interesting, because part one got $1,500. 
[01:02:30]  How about fucking watch it before you criticize him?  Whoa!  Man, E-Rock is not taking any shit.  Prince V has a point.  I would be one of the few, because part one got $1,500, and so many people were impressed.  Part two and three each have under $700.  Oh.  This page is a bust.  Oh, no.  Right, but Eric has for us.  Can we at least listen to Mr. Claw?  Claw, excuse me.  Claw?  The real life Dr. Claw.  Dr. Claw. 
[01:03:00]  Sammy goes with music and everything.  Jose, happy 4th of July to you, sir.  How you doing?  Happy 4th of July to you.  So you did some time in Iraq?  I did.  Can you tell me about that?  I was there for a year and a half.  I was doing a military police operation, serving my country, doing my dues.  So you're done now?  For now.  As soon as I'm done with the med board and everything is cleared, hopefully when I'm done  with college, they'll send me over and I'll go out of cancer.  Med board?  What's that?  My process to deal with my robotic arm. 
[01:03:30]  Now what happened here?  A week after I got back to my rack, I got electrocuted by a 7,000 volt power line, and  it left me without an arm.  It left me with a really cool arm.  Yeah.  Can you show me what this thing does?  Um, well, I can open, I can close.  The arm is cool as shit.  It really is.  It has to be said.  In either direction.  And then, for shits and giggles, because people always ask, yes, I can isolate the middle 
[01:04:00]  finger.  And then on top of that, I can rotate it.  So it adds a whole new meaning to that saying.  So you got electrocuted?  Yeah.  Pause this for one second.  Oh, is it a balcony?  You know what?  This is more interesting than I thought it would be.  Of course it is.  Yes, yes.  Sam, you lose.  But this, no, no, but E-Rock's part is hideous.  You didn't market it properly.  Yes.  E-Rock's part is hideous.  It's not hideous.  It's just basic.  Because the guy's showing the arm is spinning, and he goes back five minutes.  So, you got electrocuted? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It's all about, fuck how he got the arm.  It's all about the arm.  It took two minutes to get to the arm.  Yeah.  Well, he said, can you tell us about it?  Honestly, I would say go to E-Rock Radio on YouTube and look at Real Life Dr. Claw,  because I've never seen an arm like that.  No, not at all.  Not one where the whole hand rotates.  Do you show what else it does?  On the phone, nobody had seen the power line.  Nobody knew that it was there.  And when I was on the phone, I accidentally reached up with my left hand.  He's not even filming the arm.  My left hand got stuck, and I lost from here down, and got burnt all over the side of 
[01:05:00]  my body.  I got my own shoulder reconstructed and everything.  So, is this the only mechanic part that's on you?  Do you have stuff in your back, too?  Well said.  But robotic-wise, it's only here.  But I do have skin removed from both my thighs to do my shoulder, upper back, down my  half my bicep and tricep, and a little bit of this.  Wow, he's lucky to be alive.  Six million pound man talking about the six million.  Still burned.  All right.  Still hasn't healed properly.  Well, I know this didn't happen during the military service, but thank you for all the 
[01:05:30]  work you've done, my friend.  Oh, that's nice.  That is amazing.  Yeah.  Not as cool as your car, though, I have to say.  Car is a fiber arm?  He's a musician.  When does it transform?  Soon, if I can work it right.  Fucking music stinks.  That was from Inspector Gadget.  Yes.  It kind of made sense.  Yeah, it does.  I apologize.  The claw.  The car and the claw.  Okay, fair enough. 
[01:06:00]  Part two.  What's on part two there, Erock?  I think part two is where he takes the arm off and shows you what's under it and how  he operates it.  And what about part three?  I would like to.  I don't.  Probably more on the arm.  I don't remember.  It's been a while.  Enough about the arm.  This is interesting, actually.  Part two.  Absolutely.  You know what?  It backfires, Sam.  Because now a lot of people are going to check out real-life Dr. Claw on Erock Radio on  YouTube.  I don't mind if people check it out.  As long as it's not that stupid fucking cartoon of him.  Boo-doo-doo-doo. 
[01:06:30]  Boo-doo-doo-doo.  Jealous.  Oh, shit.  He's just jealous.  All right.  Very good.  Listen, what?  So you play the Springsteen because it really backfired.  You don't even want to watch part two.  Skim through it and find where he takes the arm off.  We're good.  We're good, right?  Yeah, we're good.  All right.  So my point was made.  Not really.  It drops off after part one.  Watch how many fucking hits this damn thing gets to me now.  I'm not against it getting hits, but you don't even want to watch it anymore. 
[01:07:00]  I would have edited it differently.  I would have made it a little more like this.  All right.  Well, then my point was made.  This is all likes and no dislikes.  How many likes?  You're an asshole.  Oh, the real life Dr. Club part two.  There's not a lot of dislikes at all.  Two likes and no dislikes.  So that's good.  It's a success.  Yeah.  I hope people don't start disliking it because that will just.  Yeah.  You shouldn't do that.  Yeah.  Why did you play the Springsteen?  Why did?  Oh, yeah.  39 years ago, he released Greetings from Ashbury Park, New Jersey.  From where? 
[01:07:30]  Ashbury Park.  Whatever.  I said Ash first.  Then I said Ash second.  Asbury.  Where?  Some place in Jersey.  I've never heard anyone get that name wrong, much less twice.  Ashbury Park.  Ashbury Park.  Ashbury Park.  Ashbury Park.  Yeah.  Isn't it As?  Yes, of course it is.  Okay.  Because then I just got confused.  Fuck.  Ashbury.  Ash.  Ashbury.  Because I'm an Ashbury. 
[01:08:00]  Bam, bam.  Hey, what do you know about Blinded by the Light there, Roland?  Oh.  I'm going to say this.  Bruce wrote it.  Gave it to Man for Man.  Man for Man made it a massive hit back in the 70s.  And then Bruce recorded his own?  No.  Fuck!  Damn it!  He recorded it for Green to Asbury Park.  And then Man for Man recorded it.  Grease at Asbury Park.  Grease at Asbury Park.  Grease.  Oh.  Oh.  And then they covered it, but they switched one word. 
[01:08:30]  Instead of deuce, they put douche.  Man for Man.  And became number one.  You don't think that's a good story?  What's a deuce?  A deuce, the car, like a deuce coupe.  Oh, yeah?  And Bruce Virgin.  And what's a douche?  And why did they say douche?  Why did they say douche, though?  Yeah, why did Man for Man decide to change it to douche?  I don't know.  To be cool.  Cool.  But it made number one.  That was Bruce's first number one hit that he didn't do. 
[01:09:00]  That he didn't do.  Why couldn't Bruce sing it like this and make it a hit on his own?  Yeah, I don't think they're saying douche.  He's a douche.  I think it sounds like douche, but they're really saying douche.  But with the effect on the vocal, it's like shh, douche.  Bruce says douche.  And you're bringing up one of the biggest classic rock arguments ever.  Oh, exactly.  Radio douchebags have been discussing this forever. 
[01:09:30]  What have they been discussing?  Whether he really said douche or if he said douche.  Man for Man says douche.  Who?  That's douche.  Nah, it's just because you're thinking it.  Think douche.  Say?  Deuce.  Yeah.  He wouldn't change it.  Deuce.  It's just the way he's saying it.  Deuce.  Deuce.  See?  That's the way he's saying it. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  We don't have to play the whole fucking thing.  Thank you, E-Rock.  That was amazing.  That was, uh...  Oh, I forgot.  That was...  Sex Man.  Wow.  That really went a while.  That was amazing.  We do have the 911 call of the home intruder.  And we also have to play...  She called 911.  You want to do Most Hateable Kid first?  Well, this kid that you bring up, uh, now that I see the video, I think, uh, wow.  You might lose?  She is terrible.  And who's your guy? 
[01:10:30]  Uh, stupid Bob from, uh...  All right.  Which one do you want to play first?  Well, it don't matter to me.  All right.  Let's play Bob first.  Go, Bob.  I know I'm going to win this one.  Let's see, Bob.  We homeschool the kids because it gives us more time to be with them.  Let's pick up a mother.  So this is cake.  Cake.  Cake.  Would that have a long A or a short A?  A short A?  No.  I waited a long time to have kids.  I'm an older mother, so I don't want to miss a minute of their lives. 
[01:11:00]  Okay, now you work on chasing the Gs.  This mother has two ugly kids.  I don't want to go to school because the teacher might be mean.  They're terrible kids.  She might throw me in a locker.  She might put a bat, a rat, and a vampire.  She might put all the things, and I'll be passed out.  They're not meant for fucking pageants, those kids.  Okay.  Look at Bob's ears.  It's the homeschooling.  We're not really worried about them being under-socialized. 
[01:11:30]  There's five.  Just like if there were five kids in your group at pageants.  Mm-hmm.  When we take them to pageants, we have taken our children to several drag shows.  He's fucking hate them.  I hate this kid.  I've had her perform in Poker Face on the bar at Applebee's.  Wait, wait, what?  I've had her perform in Poker Face on the bar at Applebee's.  It's not like people threw dollars at her or anything.  That's a great mom.  She's not a stripper.  Not yet.  We don't get a clip of Bob, really.  No, not much of Bob. 
[01:12:00]  That's all Bob.  Because he was worthless.  He dresses like a little jester elf.  It's impossible to hate anybody as much as I hate Bob.  You know, you bring up Bob.  It brings up one of my favorite bits that no one gave a shit about.  I'll be honest.  But it made me fucking howl every time was when we forced that intern to be English.  The English Bob.  English Bob.  All right, then.  Boom.  For the entire semester, we refused to acknowledge he was from Jersey.  British Bob, yeah.  Because I think Jimmy pointed out that he looked British. 
[01:12:30]  Because he had stupid rosy cheeks.  Right, and I'm sure out there in Radioland, people are like, whatever, dudes.  But it made me howl every day when he had to fucking go into that English accent.  Oh, yeah.  We have any English bulb?  I had a bulb.  Where did E-Rock go?  He's there.  I think he's searching.  Oh, okay.  Well, you need a better Bob clip for our little contest.  Yeah, very hard to find a good Bob clip.  He's just such an uncharismatic. 
[01:13:00]  Right.  Yeah.  You know what he is?  He's a...  Yeah, you can't even capture it with a video clip or anything on the radio.  Well, my most hateable kid.  Yeah.  We have featured on the show before.  Her name is Cecilia Cassini.  And she's the world's youngest fashion designer.  She stinks.  This broad is so hateable.  And what's great about this clip, almost 1.5 million views, and it's almost completely red, meaning all dislikes. 
[01:13:30]  I gave it a like.  All dislikes.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  She's cute.  She's cute.  Once again, here's Cecilia Cassini.  Look at the ribbon on her head.  Cecilia, how are you doing tonight?  I am good.  How are you?  You are the youngest fashion designer in the country, is what I hear.  Yes, I am the youngest.  And you got your first sewing machine at age six?  Yes, I did get my first sewing machine at age six after begging for like a year.  Do you remember the moment that you had the epiphany that you wanted to be a fashion designer? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, I do.  That was like the moment when I was tying ponytail holders in the back of my dresses to make them fit.  And I was just like, wait a second.  Wouldn't it be like amazing if I had a sewing machine to sew and make them actually fit me properly?  So then I just asked for a sewing machine for my sixth birthday.  So have you been taking sewing classes, or did you kind of teach yourself?  Um, well, I took like three sewing classes, but then I really didn't like my teacher, because she was like rude. 
[01:14:30]  Like she told me that some fabrics didn't match when I thought that they did.  And so I didn't go to her anymore.  So then I basically just taught myself.  So what do you like designing the most?  Dresses?  I love designing dresses, because they're so like amazing.  Like every little girl should have a dress.  Like, then I don't think they need pants, like a dress. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  What are you saying?  Who are the designers that you look up to?  Karl Lagerfeld and Diane von Fristenberg.  I love them.  They are works of art.  Can you do a little fashion spoon for our camera to check out that beautiful dress?  Oh yeah, it's a great dress.  You are so cute.  I want you to design a dress for me.  Oh, of course I will.  Can you tell everyone your website?  Yes, so my website is CeciliaCassini.com.  If you can check out your designs.  Yes, you can buy my designs online or at Fred Siegel. 
[01:15:30]  Fabulous, darling.  Thank you so much.  Fred Siegel.  She's so affected.  Even I know Fred Siegel.  She is, but here's why I don't hate her.  You don't hate her?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'll tell you what it says.  Because she's not being mean.  She's just emulating older people.  Like, she's not being a brat.  She's answering the questions and she's being pleasant.  She sounds like she's doing an impression of a gay male.  Yes.  Like, that's her idols.  Because she probably sees a lot of them in the fashion industry.  She reminds me of a gay guy in the voice of Fletcher. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, that's true.  I thought she was going to be really snotty and not answer the questions.  No, she's brutal.  Her hats are terrible.  Yeah, well, that's her thing.  That's her thing.  Horrid.  People want to play along with the most hateable kid.  Marcos, a regular to the show.  Happy New Year.  What do you got, Marcos?  Happy New Year, boys.  Welcome aboard.  I was going to say, you guys remember the kid?  No.  And he said, I like bacon.  Bacon's good for me.  No.  No.  Nope.  Oh, damn. 
[01:16:30]  It was from a TLC show.  They switched parents.  No.  Thank you.  Good job.  No.  Could be the greatest clip, too.  Who knows?  I hear.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Enough of him.  All right.  Bob is the most hateable kid.  I know, but I want, I don't.  I know we don't have clips, but.  Yeah, you just got to, like, see it at some point.  Oh, you got the bacon thing?  No cheese in a can.  Very happy to be throwing this away.  Bacon?  No, I want my bacon.  I got to tell you something. 
[01:17:00]  Bacon is good for me.  This is very mean.  You're going to be going to the grocery store.  She thinks, at the blue, she's a smart little girl, that she can do whatever she wants.  No one would make this clip much better.  No.  That's not how.  Just imagine a young E-Rock.  She can do it in our family.  Oh, God.  She's the queen, and we're the sorry people.  Oh, this little fat kid.  I have been nice to you, but now I'm coming to the edge.  I promise you one thing, okay?  If you do not have at least one food that you like, I will buy you a piece of junk. 
[01:17:30]  Is that a deal?  No, I keep losing at deals, and I don't want to make a deal anymore.  I am leaving, and you can't stop packing my bags.  He's going to drop the end, Bob.  At a very, very time day until this.  A book in the road comes, and she's sarcastic.  Curtis.  I won't be coming back until Saturday when you leave.  He's got his little luggage.  She's going to start stopping.  He's leaving the house.  But she can't run in those little high heels. 
[01:18:00]  Never see this face again.  Well, and then he was abducted, and he never did.  Yeah.  He saw that face in a shallow grave.  Hop in a van, Curtis.  I'll give you a lift.  He was cute, though.  Marcos turns out to, you know, contribute to the show.  That's a good clip.  I didn't think he was hateable, though.  He's kind of cute.  He's hateable.  A little independent.  Being a father, trust me, he's hateable.  I hate independence.  He's making his little suitcases, little luggage.  Making his way in the world.  Yeah.  He is hateable. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Good boy.  Terrible.  You want your gift?  Oh, God.  I want to see what the gift is.  It's right next to me, the whole show.  Here's the thing.  Before I give it to you, you have two options.  Two options.  Read the whole letter they sent.  Yeah, what is this?  The letter came with it?  These idiots at the Sci-Fi Network, they don't even know the show.  If you're going to give a gift to one person on the show, you give it to Anthony because  he's a Sci-Fi guy.  Yeah, that's what they call me. 
[01:19:00]  I don't know Sci-Fi.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  That's how the letter starts.  Again, just to Opie, not to Anthony or Jim.  No.  Making any resolutions this new year?  Well, as part of our Temptation is a Beast campaign for season two of Being Human, we're  putting some celebrities to the test.  Ooh, I'm a celebrity.  That's right.  Nice.  All for a good cause.  You watch that show, Ant?  Yeah.  So, Ant even knows the show.  Yeah.  I don't even know what the show's about, Sam.  Think of us as a well-meaning devil on your shoulder. 
[01:19:30]  What?  That's right.  Like, you know, angel, devil, they're like, uh-oh.  We've created a package just for you, and we're hoping that you will play along.  Open the box and decide whether you'll stick to your resolutions or give in to the offerings.  You can give in, better luck next year, and enjoy the box's booty, or resist the temptation  inside, and you'll be rewarded with a gift that supports your resolution to continue living  the healthy life and getting the hottest body in Hollywood. 
[01:20:00]  I'm not in Hollywood.  I'm barely a celebrity.  Fucking choice to make.  Well, whatever you choose to do, it would be fab if you would document it on your blog  slash Twitter feed.  Take photos of yourself with the package to prove to us you're resisting temptation, or  admit to the world that you've given in.  If you write about this package, please mention that it was provided to you by Syfy. 
[01:20:30]  Pursuant to the FTC's guides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials, your  blogs and posts should make clear that you have received a gift and are participating in  Syfy's being human.  And then, temptation is a beast promotion.  What delusional idiots.  This is like work.  If space is limited, you may use a hashtag, such as hashtag sponsored.  How about this?  Hashtag go fuck yourselves. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, exactly.  They want you to do an unpaid endorsement for them.  Which we just did, by the way.  Well, no, we're not going to give it good.  But now they know the name of the show, what network it's on.  Oh, that's fine.  Open up the dumb thing.  I'm not opening it up.  You don't want it over there?  No.  All right.  I'd like to open it.  Let's give me a look.  I'm just curious as to what it is.  Because it is for the show.  Dusty-ass box.  It's a really nice box, though.  No, it's not.  It looks nice.  It's plastic.  It's not.  It looks like fine wood.  Like an old jewelry box.  Oh, God.  The hinge is busted.  Oh, there's another note. 
[01:21:30]  Another note.  Dear, dear, I'll be.  Hold on.  This is Edgar, by the way, for the people that don't know.  He rarely comes out.  He's got dry teeth.  I've gotten it.  It takes forever to get something out of an envelope.  Just pull it out.  He's got no strength.  Dear Opie, we created this temptation just for you.  Don't open it. 
[01:22:00]  Open.  We've sent you exactly what you don't need.  And most likely, very much one.  You can give in and open it at any time.  It's completely up to you.  Oh, God.  You're so hateable.  Yeah.  Ugh.  These people. 
[01:22:30]  The thought is tempting, right?  After Al, you're unhuman.  Yeah.  But if you can resist, we'll support your resolution.  Don't look.  Oh, I was looking in the box.  He slammed it shut on me.  Jesus, Edgar.  I'm reading by giving you something to help improve the state of humanity. 
[01:23:00]  What's in the box?  Show us you haven't given in.  Oh, Sam read this already.  Sam.  Sam.  It's candy.  What is it?  Are there any good treats?  There are some good treats in there.  What is it?  Now, you're not supposed to open it.  Oh, it's a game.  Fuck that.  It's gourmet caramel.  Open it.  Everything but the kitchen sink.  Well, let's see this stuff.  The, uh... 
[01:23:30]  Gives a fuck you break a stupid New Year resolution.  Oh, no.  New Year's.  New Year's resolution.  Oh, you gotta take a picture.  It's already ripped, though.  The thing's already ripped.  Yeah, of course.  What do you mean?  So, it's open?  It's a little open, yeah.  So, you know what this is?  Some other celebrity had this dumb box.  Yeah.  They didn't want to participate.  They sent it back, and they're reusing the box.  This is soap.  You're supposed to send it back.  What are the actual rules?  Oh.  Well, you're supposed to document whether or not you've opened it, and then if you don't  open it, they'll send you a gift to help you get a hottest body in Hollywood. 
[01:24:00]  So ridiculous.  So, what do I do?  These are good.  What's in there?  All chocolates.  Those look good.  What is it?  Let me see.  That looks good.  Oh, it smells delish.  Oh, my goodness.  What are these?  Can you move out of the way?  I want to see what the box has.  Sure, buddy.  Thanks. 
[01:24:30]  Hope he's getting in there to look at the box.  Oh, that's some good stuff.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  What happened?  I hope he's hitting it with a hammer.  What?  God, that's the best-selling...  But you're hitting the treats.  Yeah, you should break the box.  Leave the treats.  Oh, wow.  The spark.  Can I have one?  Oh, these are really delicious.  They're good.  Mmm.  Well, enough with the... 
[01:25:00]  There goes the box.  That looks like a bullet hole.  It does.  Oh, and into the garbage it goes.  Aren't these good?  Oh, my God.  I'm almost glad you did that.  I know.  Look at us.  We got a couple of hens in bonbons.  What is that?  A truffle or something.  Let me see.  Damn it.  I...  I...  Have one.  It's good, dude.  Oh, I love truffles.  Yes, but you got to smell this hammer.  Smells good?  Is that the best-smelling hammer ever?  Yeah.  So, what happened?  We win or lose the temptation? 
[01:25:30]  I'm done.  I can't get any more of that.  Get rid of these.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  These are so good.  I know.  Mm-hmm.  You want one of this, Sam?  No.  No more.  Why don't throw them out?  I think you should give them.  Yeah.  Take them outside.  Huh?  What happened?  Look at this candy.  He told Marcy to get rid of it.  Jimmy's love and the temptation.  I didn't want him to throw it out.  I hate wasting food.  Okay.  Well, we only broke, like, some of the stuff.  Most. 
[01:26:00]  Most?  It's not food.  It's candy.  So, when that video goes up on your Twitter, don't forget to hashtag sponsored.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  The nerve of those motherfuckers.  Of course.  We should break.  You did a good job.  All right.  Dump temptation.  What's the name of the show?  Being Human.  Being Human.  On Syfy.  So, they get their plug anyway.  You didn't pass the test, Oppie.  Oppie.  And we get to hear Edgar today.  You didn't either, Anthony.  Anthony.  I don't like the way he says my name at all. 
[01:26:30]  No, you don't like it.  No, I hate it.  Anthony.  No, he says,  Anthony.  Anthony.  Anthony.  I don't like it.  Oppie and Anthony.  He sounds like he needs an iron lung.  Sometimes I spray.  I can't believe it's not butter on my teeth.  Is that lubricated a little?  It makes them moist.  You're despicable.  My teeth are dry.  Yeah.  Damn, Amy Schumer has a really nice ass. 
[01:27:00]  Where is that?  Look at that profile right there.  Look at how it just goes up and around.  You should see the shot of her in the comedy cellar.  Did you see those pictures?  Oh, yeah.  The ones that were in what?  Vanity Fair?  Yeah, or whatever it may be.  I don't think we've talked about her ass enough.  She's outside the studio and has no idea we're just looking at her ass.  Amy Schumer is next.  And you've got your pal coming in today, huh?  Yes.  Ty West.  And Sarah Paxton, who is the actress in the movie?  Yeah.  What's the name of the movie? 
[01:27:30]  The Innkeepers.  It's good, right?  I was going to watch it.  Yeah, it's creepy.  It's funny.  It's fucking just a good, one of those little horror movies based in a hotel.  Yeah.  And, yeah, pretty cool.  Okay.  So we'll talk to Amy Schumer next.  And we've got the 911 audio.  Oh, yeah.  This is a great story, man.  Home Invasion.  And she didn't take any guff.  But she was asking permission.  It's a whole thing.  We'll get into it next.  Stay there. 
[01:28:00]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't like smashing things anymore. 
[01:28:30]  No?  What kind of hack?  You don't like it?  No, it's like...  You over it?  It's kind of expected.  Then you feel awkward.  Because then you realize, oh, I guess I got to do this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like Gallagher with the fucking watermelon.  Yeah, it's Zeppelin playing Stairway to Heaven.  I got some new shit.  Some new shit, man.  I got some new shit.  Fuck this Stairway to Heaven.  Some new shit, man.  I don't have to play Stairway anymore.  One guy goes, how did you have a hammer handy? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, really?  That is kind of frightening.  I kind of just have it.  And it's got his thing.  I got my thing.  Dang.  But I might have a gun now.  Oh, Jesus.  That's all I'm saying, though, about that.  Whoa.  I just might.  Sam doesn't think so.  So I said, Sam, challenge me.  Break into my apartment.  Oh, shit.  Amy Schumer should join the show immediately.  She's going to be at Caroline's.  Amy.  Hi, Amy. 
[01:29:30]  The beautiful Amy Schumer.  Hello.  But she's got a lot going on.  But she's also extremely funny.  It's Jimmy.  Amy.  Hi.  No, it's actually Jimmy eating eggs.  Jimmy doesn't smell like eggs.  That would be.  Yeah, I don't think he's farting today.  No.  It's too early to smell your asshole.  Amy, I got to ask you right off the bat.  First time headlining Caroline's or no?  Yeah.  It is?  Yeah.  It's a big deal for me.  Wow.  All right, listen.  That is big.  Listen, the listeners are sick of just hearing the blah, blah plugs. 
[01:30:00]  This one is important.  Oh.  We got to get people out to see Amy Schumer if it's her first time headlining at Caroline's.  You're not going to be disappointed.  Not important.  No, because after a while, it's like, oh, comic, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But every once in a while, there's a special one.  This is a special one, guys.  This is a special one.  Thanks for knowing that.  Yeah.  They don't allow a lot of women to headline at Caroline's to begin with.  Really?  I remember.  No, no bullshit.  You know, I started in New York.  Oh, wait.  No, they didn't.  Yeah.  No, it's mostly blacks.  It's mostly blacks.  But yeah, that was like a thing.  I remember walking by. 
[01:30:30]  They show all the headliners coming up.  And it was always just like Susie Essman.  And that's it.  And whoever the female earthquake is.  And I was like, one day, you know.  So I walked by there on the way here.  I was like.  Oh, you had to take a look.  Gave the old pat on the back.  Yeah.  I was like, you did it, girl.  No, this is.  That's what I call myself, girl.  Girl.  Yeah.  I get kind of urban.  This one is important.  Hopefully, we can get a lot of people to see Amy Schumer headlining at Caroline's.  This is really cool for her.  Yes.  Starting what?  Tomorrow?  Tonight?  Starting tonight.  Tonight's a Sunday. 
[01:31:00]  Tonight through Sunday.  Caroline's 212-757-4100.  You will not be disappointed.  Amy's great.  Uh-huh.  Absolutely great.  I'm going to give you a show.  Ooh.  I don't know what that means.  I just.  Who do you work with, Gio?  Godville.  Who do you work with, Gio?  Yeah.  The guys I travel with.  Mark Normand and Jackie Monaghan.  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's got a spray tan.  Yeah.  I didn't notice the spray tan.  You did that?  I told him.  Like toddlers and tiaras?  Yeah.  I am.  I'm doing a photo shoot tomorrow.  Yeah.  And they were like, will you get a spray tan? 
[01:31:30]  I was like, okay.  Can you make yourself look acceptable?  Oh, God.  They thought you were a little too paste on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The pasty color off.  They must have seen some Facebook photo.  They were like, yikes.  What the hell is.  What's wrong with this girl?  Let's do something with this girl.  But you didn't go with the Jersey Shore spray on tan.  That obnoxious orange.  They told them what to give me.  Like I went in and they had orders.  Oh, they did.  Yeah.  There's different types of spray tanning, I guess.  Yeah.  I always thought it was just one color.  I wanted black face.  I was like, let's really do this. 
[01:32:00]  And they were like, they pulled the reins.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What shoot is it?  It's for GQ.  Whoa.  Uh-huh.  Gentleman's Quarterly?  I didn't even want to say it because I know Jimmy, I thought he was going to be like  gay, cool, like some makeup.  No, no, I don't do stuff like that.  I don't knock publications.  Oh, my God.  That's the one line Jimmy has.  I don't knock periodicals.  GQ stands for GQ.  God bless him.  GQ is a big one.  Absolutely.  That's a big one.  I thought it was some just dumb local rag. 
[01:32:30]  That's right.  Newsday is doing a two-page review of my blog.  That's funny.  It's a photo shoot for TV Guide.  Not to get too inside, but me and Anne talk about Newsday from time to time because we're  from Long Island.  It's the worst fucking newspaper.  It just looks awful.  It's the worst.  But it doesn't even look worth reading.  No.  They got changed the font or something.  That's the New York Times for Long Island, though.  That is their paper.  It sucks.  That's their paper. 
[01:33:00]  Those people.  Those people out there.  And it's too thick.  There's too many ads in it.  Sometimes you're going through, like, 15 pages of ads before you get to anything.  Anything.  And they're one of those papers that'll start a story and then say, you know, for the rest  of this story, go to page 93.  You're like, whoa.  Who has that kind of time?  Us.  You know what?  I like the post for that because the post just knows that it caters to idiots who would  read, like, part of the story. 
[01:33:30]  And then if it was told to go to the back of the paper, you're like, no.  No.  I'm not doing it.  Yeah.  John Mulaney says the post is like your dumb friend explaining the New York Times to you.  You know?  Just like, okay, so these guys were in Iowa, okay?  That's good.  Yeah.  But you know what?  I guess it outsells the other papers because it's so, you know.  Because it's cartoony.  I only buy the New York Times when I'm kidding myself.  I hate the Times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, oh, let me look at the...  I know. 
[01:34:00]  I'll buy it on a plane just to, like, impress somebody.  Oh, it's strictly Dullsville.  Yeah.  It's pompous.  It's boring.  It's a very overrated periodical.  Yeah.  Periodical.  Whoa.  I can't...  But the post, like, the headlines, they cannot...  They're unbearable.  Yeah, yeah.  And they...  When anything big happens, you wonder what they're going to do the next day.  Yeah.  I like when Ike Turner...  He died, right?  Is he dead?  Yeah.  I was like, Ike beats Tina to death.  All right.  That's pretty funny.  I can't...  I loved that one. 
[01:34:30]  I was like, oh, my God.  That's a good one.  I hate the fact that they're cheeky Australians.  I hate fucking cheeky humor.  Cheeky.  They are cheeky.  They're cheeky.  When Ike Turner died, it said, um, a stare way to heaven.  Oh, God.  You know some guys just started drinking champagne as soon as you thought of it.  Just pop that cord.  Tomorrow is mine.  Are these the best headlines ever?  Tiger admits I'm a cheetah.  Cheetah.  Oh, God.  It's cheating.  Let's find the best ones ever.  Oh, look at these.  Oh, no. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, no.  That's how, like, much they talk down to their readers.  Yeah.  They'll get this.  It was written on there.  We got by this paper.  A-hole.  A-rod.  It's A-hole.  Turban warfare.  Turban warfare.  That doesn't seem okay.  Not too racist, isn't it?  Oh, my God.  Freakin' flyer.  Freakin' flyer.  Freakin' flyer, the dude that drank beer and jumped off the airplane.  Oh, yeah.  We remember that wordplay.  Yeah.  All right.  Tiger pulls out. 
[01:35:30]  Sometimes they nail it.  Yep.  How was your holidays, Amy?  Ugh.  Never again.  I'm not doing it anymore.  No?  No, I clocked.  You probably say that every year, though, right?  No, this was bad.  Bad one?  I usually go home with whatever asshole I'm dating and, like, pretend that I'm not Jewish.  You know, I sit in church with their family and laugh at them.  Yeah.  And their, like, beliefs.  I'm like, there's no Lord.  But this year I had to hang out with my own family and, ugh, never again. 
[01:36:00]  Really?  I'm, ugh.  It was like, I feel like someone was sitting on my chest and not in, like, the good way.  But it was literally, like, my friends from home were like, let's get dinner.  What time do you want to meet for dinner?  And I was like, four.  Let's meet right now.  Get me out of here.  It was brutal.  It was brutal.  Family's on Long Island, you said?  Yeah.  So you got a sister and who else?  Well, my sister's in Chicago.  My mom lives in Long Beach.  And my dad, you know, sad, sad case and living in a home. 
[01:36:30]  All of his teeth are falling out.  Oh, no.  It's like train spotting over there.  I'm like, where are your teeth?  He's like, I fell.  I'm like, oh, my God.  The orderlies are hitting him.  I hope so.  Oh, it's terrible.  He would love it.  I hope so.  He would love it.  He's not depressed.  He's just done, though.  He's just like, oh.  Really?  It's over?  He's just done.  I'm like, I found an acupuncturist.  He's like, just let me fucking let all my teeth fall out.  I'm like, okay.  It was bad.  This holiday was horrible.  63. 
[01:37:00]  That's it.  Fuck.  I know.  You guys, you know, you guys.  That's nothing.  63 is nothing.  My mom's out.  He has MS.  My mom's 75.  MS gets bad, huh?  I thought they had that sort of figured out where he could live kind of all right.  Only for Montel.  No.  Montel, yeah.  Montel seems to have gotten that down.  Montel's fine.  No, MS is a bitch.  It's not, yeah.  And he didn't take care of it.  He just, like, still got fucked up.  Yeah.  It sucked.  This holiday sucked.  And then I got home.  This is why my mom sucked so much.  She starts putting on home videos of, like, when he was healthy. 
[01:37:30]  I'm like, what are you doing?  Isn't that depressing?  Are you insane?  Yes.  Yeah, you don't want to see that.  Oh, my God.  It was really a bummer.  How are your holidays, you guys?  Yeah, wow.  Holy mother.  We just got a little rain cloud over this morning.  Did you exchange gifts or anything like that?  No.  Did you get anything for Christmas?  I brought my dad The Wire on a DVD.  Oh, that's all right.  Very good.  Take up some time.  And my mom, I just promised I wouldn't talk about her on stage at Caroline's when she comes  with her friends. 
[01:38:00]  I was like, Merry Christmas.  Yeah, that's the best thing she could ever.  Would you please just talk about how your mother molested you?  What?  Yeah, just make it really brutal and not even really good jokes to it.  How about no jokes?  Yeah.  And then I would wake up.  Well, I don't know what to do because I really have been talking about her pussy from when I was a kid.  But I can't, I can't, it's just part of something I kind of stumbled upon, her pussy, just how  the difference between like now, you know, like women now, I guess like 10, 15 years ago, 
[01:38:30]  men were all just like, would you ladies mind just looking like babies again in that  department, right?  And we were like, okay.  Because I remember my mom, I don't know why I remember her bottomless, but I do.  Wow.  Oh yeah, that's all.  I know, but her.  Especially the part where you go, I don't remember why I know this.  I don't know why.  That's scary.  Yeah, maybe I really was molested.  No, but it was like, like her, if you looked at her bikini area, it was like, it was like  the black smoke monster from Lost. 
[01:39:00]  Like, it's like she's being swarmed by bees.  It was like a lot.  So I've been like talking about it.  I'm just like, she's going to come to the show.  You know, I guess I just won't, we'll leave that part out.  That's not that bad though.  It gets worse.  I'm just not talking about it.  Yeah, she's not going to do all the.  It gets worse.  You get to hear more at Caroline's.  Yeah, yeah.  Starting tonight through Sunday.  Right, right.  It's just.  Amy Schumer headlining.  That's awesome.  Thank you.  We got a girl that wants to talk dirty to Jimmy.  What?  Okay.  We haven't had a reason in a while. 
[01:39:30]  This should never be a setup for that.  It should always be plunked right down.  All right.  We got Laura in Boston.  My sister.  Me too.  Laura, give us the basics.  Hey.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  I'm great.  Okay.  What's up, Laura from Boston?  Off to a slow start.  Laura.  Nothing.  Is this Jimmy?  Yeah, this is Jimmy.  Yeah, but I'm saying, give us the basics.  What do you look like?  What do you want to do?  Yeah.  Um, I look like I have blue eyes and dark hair and I want to suck Jimmy's dick. 
[01:40:00]  Whoa.  Well, congratulations.  We have a winner.  If you said brown eyes, I would have hung up on you.  Blue eyes and brown hair are the only requirements to have my dick buried in your tonsils.  Right where I like it.  That's where, you're a good girl, Laura.  How old are you?  22.  Perfect.  Um, are you a big girl, small girl? 
[01:40:30]  I'm skinny.  I'm athletic.  I work out.  Huh.  That means big thighs.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No, no, I keep it right.  How tall are you?  5'6".  How much do you weigh?  Like 122.  That's perfect.  She's perfect.  Yeah?  Yes.  So what is it that makes you want to suck my penis?  Oh my God.  I just think you're fucking sexy and I want to fuck you.  Oh. 
[01:41:00]  Well, thank you very much.  Um, are you married?  No, you're not married.  You're too young.  Do you have a fellow?  And does he know you're calling?  No marriage for this girl.  Okay, good.  No marriage for that girl.  And now, how often are you in New York?  I will be in New York next weekend, actually.  Now, are you aware of who you're speaking to?  Or did someone just tell you to call this number and say you want to suck Jimmy's dick?  Because I don't need the look I usually get.  No.  The pulls out.  That sad look like, oh. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, no.  What's that, Laura?  I said I am very aware of who I'm speaking to.  Oh, okay.  I'm very aware.  She wants to talk dirty.  Laura, why don't you talk dirty to Jimmy then?  Yeah, why don't you just get me all hot and bothered and stuff?  Oh, no.  Amy, if you want to talk dirty as well, you're more than welcome.  Oh, I'm super busy.  You're more than welcome.  I'm super busy over here.  Laura, go ahead.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  Sam has a good point.  Laura, can we put you on hold for one second so you can give E-Rock your Facebook name? 
[01:42:00]  And we don't want to give it out over the air.  And this way we can pop up your Facebook.  Unless she wants to give it out publicly.  Yes.  Yeah, no, you can put me on hold.  Okay, put her on hold.  And then we'll get you right back.  We're going to see what Laura looks like on Facebook.  Yeah.  I bet you Laura's dishy.  What does that mean?  Dishy is like really pretty.  I'm just getting into like the way sexy talk happens.  Oh, okay.  I'm really good.  I'm going to get her so fucking wet.  Ooh.  I think she needs to see your face when you decide.  Yeah, I'm just going to get it fucking sopping. 
[01:42:30]  Oh, God.  So you usually wait that long?  Like I was waiting for you to ask about her pussy lips.  Do you wait?  Like, is that something you wait to get into?  There's a little delay on the phone.  But no, I like to know immediately.  Like literally a woman should just call up and go,  Hi, medium, closer to large.  My name is.  It's the most pertinent information.  Why is this taking so long, Sam?  I'm sure E-Rock is probably flirting.  Do you like blondes?  He, he, he, he, he. 
[01:43:00]  He, he, he, he.  Oh, God.  E-Rock, what's taking so long in there?  E-Rock.  I think he's talking to the girl.  I know, but all we needed was a name.  I know.  We want to pop up the name E-Rock.  Yeah.  We got Amy Schumer in studio.  Playing headlines.  Oh, my God.  He's playing headlines.  Playing headlines.  Yeah.  What's up, E-Rock?  Oh, he's got it written down.  Why did you say to my ear?  Because it was too good.  Okay.  Do you like Laura, Yurok?  It was all giggling on the phone.  She's turned on right now. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, maybe down there is really, really gushy.  Down there.  Down there is really gushy.  We like Jimmy's sexy talk.  Yeah, I'm really good.  All right, here we go.  Let's see what she looks like.  Let's see.  And hold on.  Laura, you're on hold.  Just stay where you are.  Turn to the left.  All right.  Okay.  She's really cute.  Turn to the left, Sam.  Stop looking.  Oh, yeah.  She's cute.  That's very acceptable.  Laura?  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  You passed your audition.  You're very, very pretty.  Not bad.  What's your nationality?  Irish, Italian, and Portuguese.  Nice.  Portuguese, that's not Brazilian.  That means she has a penis.  Oh, perfect.  No, I don't have a penis.  No shit, Sheryl.  I thought she explained herself.  No, I don't have a penis.  Oh, thank you.  You're busty.  What's your bra size?  I am like a large B.  Nice. 
[01:44:30]  Very nice.  Are your nipples dark or light?  Light.  Light.  Are they large or small?  You're areola.  They're just perfect.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Is Jimmy asking all the right questions, Amy?  I'm getting excited.  These are not at all sexy questions.  No, they're not.  It's like she's enlisting.  You can't base the assessment on one picture.  How many push-ups can you do?  She's like, what?  I just want to blow you.  Why are you asking me this?  Yes.  Ann is requesting more pictures.  How do we do this?  It should just be, are you a burn victim? 
[01:45:00]  Great.  Here's the address.  Sam?  I just sent a friend a request, so.  She wanted to ask you.  Is Ellie asking?  She's in a car, though, right?  Oh, she's driving?  She's got a phone?  Oh.  Pull over.  Damn it.  Do it on your phone.  It's Facebook.  Yeah, you do it on your phone.  You going to work, Laura?  No, I'm actually on my way home.  What are you, why are you on your way home at this hour?  Busy night.  Because I went out last night and I was being naughty.  Oh, what did you do that was so naughty?  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  I just got really drunk.  That's not too naughty.  No.  I made bad decisions and I got really drunk.  What bad decisions?  Fess up a little bit.  Yeah.  Actually, they were actually really good decisions, but.  What'd you do?  Well, you got to say what they are.  You didn't bet a color, did you?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's what I was waiting to hear.  What'd you do, Laura?  Oh.  I did not bet a guy at number one.  Well, it is Boston, Amy. 
[01:46:00]  She put an A at the end, so it's kind of more like, she probably just likes hip-hop.  Well, I just met my wife.  Let's see.  All right, so you didn't, did you sleep with someone last night?  No.  Okay, what did you do that was bad?  Did you, did you, did you blow somebody?  Um, yes.  Oh.  You did?  Was it somebody that, yay!  Oh.  Was it somebody you knew?  Um, I didn't get his name, no.  What a fucking good egg she is.  Didn't get his name.  Well, give us the details. 
[01:46:30]  How did this come about?  He bought me a drink.  Who's the, who's the kid?  Yay.  Actually, no, I think I know his name.  His name's Steve.  Yes.  Yes.  Ew.  What is that?  Where is it?  Where is it?  Is that, is that, you have a son?  Are you a mommy?  Yes.  You are a mom?  Okay.  A very young mom?  That's your kid.  You're a mommy blowing strangers on a Wednesday night. 
[01:47:00]  He's a cute kid.  Don't judge her, okay?  Yeah, you know, you're right.  She knows what she wants.  You're right.  Kids and cops, what's the problem?  There's nothing wrong with that.  What's wrong with that?  Who are we to judge?  With semen breath.  She's a good girl.  Sorry, Laura.  He's cute.  Yeah, just because she has a kid.  She's got a cute kid, by the way.  She can't be a little wild.  Who the hell are we to judge?  Yeah, yeah.  No, wait, this is Laura's friend now.  Hello, what's your name?  I'm Kim.  Hi, Kim.  Is Laura for real, or does she really want to treat my penis like a pan flute, or is she 
[01:47:30]  just joshing?  But how are you involved with this whole thing?  Yeah.  Were you out with her?  Yeah, with her naughtiness, obviously.  Okay, you're involved with her naughtiness?  Oh, do you guys lezz out?  Lezz out.  What's that?  I'm a wingman.  You're a wingman, okay.  This is all reading very Casey Anthony to me right now.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.  Sammy the nanny is going to come in.  The more pictures we go through, the more I'm filling up.  This girl is a fucking trooper.  Now you have to Facebook me. 
[01:48:00]  Wait, let's see what the wingman looks like.  Yeah, are you one of her Facebook friends?  Yeah, Kim Smith.  Whoa.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, there's Kim Smith right there.  All right, let's give it a click.  Whoa.  Wow.  Oh, hey, fuck Laura.  Holy Jesus, Kim.  Oh, my God.  Kim Smith is a dick.  Wow, way.  The wingman's going to be taking the lead position, and you're going to be dropping back on ready  five.  All right, you are on deck.  Now, Kim Smith, do you have a boyfriend or a kid, or what's your deal?  Oh, my God, look how quick Jimmy sells out. 
[01:48:30]  No, I like Laura.  Laura's the one I want.  How about some more photos?  Come on.  What are you doing?  What the fuck?  Now, Laura's great.  Let's look at Kim.  Photos.  I bet, guys.  Oh.  What'd she say?  What?  My Facebook is private.  You can't see more pictures.  Okay, hold on.  Except Sam's friend request.  Except his friend request that he just sent you.  All right, hold on.  What?  So now, Kim, how?  You're busty.  What kind of boots are those?  I have a bunch of boobs.  Now, how long have you and Laura been friends? 
[01:49:00]  Like 10 years.  Oh, you know her a long time.  Okay.  Now, she has a son.  Experimenting as a young girl.  That's right around when she had a kid.  You do realize that Laura should be your wingman, right?  That is rude.  No, Laura's very sexy.  She's all right.  I like Laura.  Yeah.  Amy, who do you like?  I like them both.  I can't choose.  Don't make me choose.  Don't make me choose.  And who do you like?  I like Kim.  Yeah.  I'm in camp, Kim.  I'm team Laura.  Let's just wait until we see pictures of Kim's kids.  That's true.  I want to choose based on the kids. 
[01:49:30]  Now, Kim, do you have children, too?  What?  Is this Laura or Kim?  Kim.  Kim.  Kim, do you have kids, too?  No.  Okay.  All right.  Nice and tight, still.  Plan B for you, huh?  Are you naughty like Laura?  Yep.  Oh, you're both naughty together.  Kim's a good egg.  Oh, you're a good friend.  I respect that.  All right.  We're getting some pictures of Kim now.  She's very pretty.  They're both hot.  They're both really hot.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  All right.  Keep going. 
[01:50:00]  Whoa, man.  Look at that.  This is some good stuff.  Oh, Jesus.  Now, do you have a gentleman friend?  No, I do not have a gentleman friend.  Oh, you're both two single gals up in Boston?  Wow.  There's just fucking and sucking going on when they go out.  Oh, my God.  Just looking for cock.  Jesus.  These girls love cock.  How much do you girls love cock?  Oh.  Do you like tooting on a pud, do you?  Oh, my God. 
[01:50:30]  So sexy.  Tooting on a pud.  These girls are so lucky.  These girls are so lucky.  I hear a little jealousy from Amy Schumer.  Oh, my God.  I'm beside myself.  But, Amy, these girls love cock.  They love cock.  Oh, God.  Guys love a girl that loves cock.  Loves cock.  I know.  I, you know, I love, I like cock.  Oh, right.  But I'm not thinking about it 24-7.  Oh, these girls constant, just a want and need for cock. 
[01:51:00]  Just their every hole needs a cock.  Yes.  Let's ask them about where the poo-poo comes out.  One of them loved cock so much, she let it stay in a little too long.  A little too long.  A little too long.  They're in the pull-out phase.  Yep.  Yep.  And my friend, not me.  Ah, not you.  Not you.  You know when to have them pull out.  She doesn't get pregnant because she takes it in the fucking asshole.  She fucking loves.  Yeah.  You don't have an ass like that without it getting fucked.  Oh, yeah.  Let me tell you, right?  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Am I right or wrong?  Hold on.  Wait, do I have to ask you a question?  Yes.  Will you take us out on a date?  Of course.  Where would you like to...  He's a gentleman.  Like a serious question.  Where would you...  Yes.  Where would you like to go, my angel?  Where would you like to go?  Go to Hooters.  Go to Hooters?  Jesus.  Jesus.  Wow.  That's a little too classy.  I was going to shoot a little higher and take you to a finer eating establishment.  But if you want to go to Hooters, I'll be happy to take you there for some wings.  It's a simpletons.  No, no, no.  I'm just kidding.  Let's go somewhere nice.  Yeah, I'll take you somewhere nice.  Now, who is this am I speaking to? 
[01:52:00]  Go to Applebee's.  No, Applebee's.  Is this Laura or Kim?  This is back to Laura.  What is it?  A menage a trois?  These girls are fucked.  What are you guys on?  Are you doping?  Wow, that's disgusting.  What?  I don't know.  I'll take you...  Now, would you both be coming on the dinner extravaganza?  Good question.  Wait, what?  That's nice.  Two girls?  Are you both coming on the date with Jimmy?  Well, she's my wingman. 
[01:52:30]  Of course she's coming.  All right, fair enough.  So what is that going to do?  Like, is she going to cockblock?  Get your mind out of the gutter, Jimmy.  My mind's not...  That was Anthony.  That's me.  That's me.  Sorry.  No, no.  We can all just go out for a nice din-din.  We don't have to do anything sexual.  Oh, no.  She already said she'll blow you, though.  What are you talking about, Jimmy?  That's true.  Why don't you bookend the date with blowjoes?  Yeah, cockblocking yourself.  What are you doing?  Hey, fucking...  Don't talk about those blowjobs.  Excuse me, Laura.  Let me educate the people in the room.  At this point, you're starting with the blowjobs.  Let me educate the people in the room in how you bullshit to get someone to dinner, and 
[01:53:00]  then you force-feed them pud in the car.  But she already admitted she'll take the pud.  She'll take the pud on the way to dinner.  Then you have a little nice dinner, and then see what happens after that.  So why do you like me, Laura?  I'm an average-looking guy.  Why do you like me?  No, I need to ask you a question.  Okay.  Can Anthony come along?  Whoa!  Whoa!  Oh, boy.  Hello.  And the, uh, what's the blowjob situation?  Yeah.  Where do we stand on the, uh...  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:53:30]  You don't blow until the fifth date.  Are you just using me to get to Anthony?  On the fifth date?  It doesn't waste.  Can we go to five places in one night?  Here's a billiards hall.  Date number two.  Yeah, it's like Stations of the Cross.  Roll down to the knees.  Stations of the Cross.  What happened to the talking dirty part Laura was going to do for Jimmy?  Yeah.  And Kim could get involved as you two lez out.  Our baby daddy.  What's that two night?  Well, I was on the phone with our baby daddy right now. 
[01:54:00]  Oh, okay.  This is Kim.  So now Kim...  Our baby daddy.  Uh-oh.  I don't like the sound of that.  Well, the kid looks pretty white.  Have you ever been...  Have you ever been with a black gentleman?  That is absolutely disgusting.  I like the way this girl thinks.  You passed the Anthony test.  Some people have the door lock test with a girl.  Anthony wants to know, have you ever been friends with a black gentleman?  Anthony's test has one question.  That's it.  One question.  That is all.  So, yes, Kim and Laura can come to New York and come to a fine eating establishment with Anthony and myself. 
[01:54:30]  I guess I'll just babysit.  Yeah.  That's good.  Now, how come you...  Why are you single, Kim?  Why are you single?  You're very cute.  Yeah, what's the baggage?  I'm ready to mingle.  No, I just got out of a three-year relationship.  Oh, okay.  How did it end?  What happened that you broke up?  He was a dick.  What do you mean?  Come on.  Be a little more specific. 
[01:55:00]  He's an asshole.  You were with him for that many years.  It took you three years to figure that out?  No.  No.  Did he cheat on you?  All the way around.  Did he cheat on you?  Yeah.  She said all the way around, meaning she was cheating on him.  You cheated on him, and he was a dick because he got mad?  What a dick.  What an asshole this guy is.  No.  I didn't say it like that.  I didn't say it like that.  I meant he's on me.  No, this guy probably wasn't giving you a...  Now, let me ask you a personal question. 
[01:55:30]  Do you shave?  How can I say this?  Sexy?  I'm just like the 60s, you idiot.  I'm going to shave.  I like that.  That's what that did deserve.  I was going to say, do you shave where the baby falls out?  Oh, boy.  You don't even ask girls if they shave anymore, I guess.  I don't know.  If they don't, it means they're schizophrenic.  But it shows your age, because at this point, it's like, what are you talking about?  Yeah.  But hair's making a bit of a comeback with the younger generation.  A little bit?  A little bit.  She goes, of course, I think you idiots of the 60s.  You idiots.  She does not respect you. 
[01:56:00]  This is going to work out.  Please.  She's perfect.  This is going to work.  If you don't mind getting on the Staten Island Ferry, you are looking at your wife.  Oh, yeah.  So now, is this Kim or Laura?  You gals keep passing the phones back and forth.  It's Kim.  It's so Kim.  Okay.  Now, are you a dirty talker as well?  Well, it depends.  On what?  Are you a little shy?  She's buying time.  That's what I do.  I'm like, it depends.  Google.  Other words for cock. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, they just hit a telephone point.  Yeah.  Drive safe, girls.  Do you have...  You're up there in Boston, right?  Yep.  You got any...  HPV.  HPV.  You got any pictures that you've taken in the mirror?  Or anything like that?  Wait, what?  You got any mirror pictures that you've taken to yourself in the bathroom?  Anything?  No.  I am a classy lady.  Well, I've seen some classy pics of that.  You have come to the wrong place.  They're all classy until they put their one leg up on the sink. 
[01:57:00]  I put a powdered wig on my labia.  It looks very regal.  What town are they from up there?  That says a lot, too.  What town, ladies?  Where are you from, ladies?  Revere.  Ah!  Revere!  Yeah!  Fucking Revere girls.  That's nice.  They're good, right?  Oh, yeah.  Revere girls are goers.  They are goers.  I'm going to Facebook friend request you.  Oh.  Oh, Jimmy.  Would you accept my friend request if I sent it to you?  Yeah, of course I will.  Okay, I'm doing... 
[01:57:30]  With bells on.  Ooh.  Do it now.  Do it now.  Hold on.  I'm doing it with Laura first.  Was Kim with a man last night, too?  That's loyalty.  Kim, were you with somebody last night, as well?  Mm, nope.  Actually, maybe.  Maybe?  What does that mean?  I'm just kidding.  Of course I was.  Oh, you are?  Of course I was.  Where do you find these guys?  Bars?  Wait.  Wait, what?  Where do you find all these guys?  In bars?  Craigslist.  I'm just kidding.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding. 
[01:58:00]  What was the joke?  I don't know.  I didn't hear that.  They're rambling.  They said Craigslist.  Oh, Craigslist.  Oh, we got a couple of prostitutes.  Ew, gross.  No, I'm kidding.  All right.  Anthony, they're nice girls.  What do you drink?  Me, too.  Why do I have so many pharmacists right now?  God, if you're blowing guys on Wednesday night, you might as well get paid for it.  Really?  Well, we're not.  I'm trying to find Laura on Facebook, but...  Name your poison.  What do you like to drink?  Diet Coke.  Yeah, did you ever have gummy vodka? 
[01:58:30]  Gummy vodka.  That's good.  Now, I can make it gummy for you, though.  Oh, my God.  See, I just implied that I was going to cum in your beverage and gum up the works.  What's gummy vodka?  What is gummy vodka?  That's what the kids are drinking these days.  Is that like Sizzurp?  I put some Jolly Ranchers in some cough syrup.  You've gotten so urban.  Oh, I know.  You're a rapper.  Ant knows all the tricks.  Sizzurp.  What are your aspirations? 
[01:59:00]  Aspirations.  What?  Aspirations.  Pertinent questions.  It's not a bad question.  Where do you see yourself in five years?  More kids.  Well, I was a good kid.  With Jimmy.  I'm married to Jimmy.  Wow.  Married to Jimmy.  Now, this is Laura again.  Am I correct?  No, this is Kim.  Oh, my God.  Two girls are not loyal.  Well, I like that.  Yeah.  I'm trying to find you on Facebook. 
[01:59:30]  Two girls, one pud.  That's for Jimmy.  All right.  Yeah.  Believe me, there's enough cock to go around, ladies.  There's plenty of cock for all.  Cock for you and cock for you.  Who wants cock first?  Who's the first lucky devil?  Oh, God.  Jeez.  Yeah.  By the way, when I fuck, I always repeat the phrase, well, aren't you the lucky girl?  Girls love that, by the way.  That is awful.  They really do love that.  Oh, God. 
[02:00:00]  Fuck, man.  That is unfair.  Yeah.  I'm trying to find you on Facebook.  Sam, could you?  Sam.  I never hand my phone to anybody.  I'll email you.  What?  Oh, Iraq just said my ear is an email.  Yeah, I heard that, too.  Thank you, Iraq.  Because I want to friend you on Facebook so we can be friends.  But where's the talking dirty part for everybody else out there?  Where's Laura?  Laura, you were going to talk dirty to Jimmy.  Let's go.  Yeah, I know.  Laura, you need to stop talking dirty.  Oh, and she's right here.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the whole gist of this call. 
[02:00:30]  Let's get to some talking dirty.  I agree.  All right?  Hi, Jimmy.  Hello, Laura.  Welcome back to the program.  Oh, thank you.  You're welcome.  So you're going to talk dirty.  What did you want to talk about?  What do you like sexually?  Um, I like whips and chains.  Come on.  You don't like whips and chains.  No one who likes whips and chains says that.  No.  Do you like being tied up?  Um, I like tying people up.  I like being tied up when I want to be somewhere and I'm stuck at motor vehicle. 
[02:01:00]  I'm like, oh, I'm tied up.  I would love to throw you under the bus for that.  But as you said that, I was thinking of a tied up joke.  You just beat me to an awful joke.  To an awful one.  So not only was your joke terrible, mine would have been worse and it took longer.  Well, to be a terrible joke, it has to classify as a joke, which I don't even think that fit the criteria.  So now, Laura, have you ever tied anybody up?  That's right.  Um, I have not tied anyone up, no.  Okay.  I'm looking at a picture of you in a little black skirt.  You have very nice upper thigh muscles. 
[02:01:30]  Wow.  That might be back.  That's Laura?  Another picture of Laura?  Yeah, she's very sexy.  How tall is Gail?  5'6".  5'6"?  125.  122.  122.  Wow.  You got a firm ass there, don't you?  Well, she is athletic.  Those are really nice legs.  What do you do in the athletic field?  Um, well, I run.  I go to the gym, obviously.  You know, I have to keep that radiator.  Mm-hmm.  I have to keep it tight.  Yeah, nice.  What is this whole thing about? 
[02:02:00]  I don't know.  They're just being silly.  I don't know what this is.  The young girl, the 20, 22, they're just being silly geese.  That's adorable.  But I think that they are troopers, though.  Yeah.  I think they'll follow through.  I think so, too.  I believe in you guys.  No, let me ask you.  Obviously, you're unemployed because you're driving home from drunkenness at 8.30.  I'm not unemployed.  Oh, no.  Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.  Where do you work, sweetheart?  Hey, I'm a cocktail waitress.  Okay, you work nights.  Now, how often do you come to...  Oh, I got to sound cool.  How often do you come to the Big Apple? 
[02:02:30]  I've never been, actually.  Oh, well, you should come.  But you said you're coming this weekend.  I'm coming, if not next week, the week after.  Now, what reason are you coming?  Do you have something to do here?  No, I'm just coming.  A lot of dick.  All right, yeah.  So you're coming here for...  For your pud.  Yeah, you're coming here just to get some prick.  What's the matter?  What's wrong with you?  What are you, a dyke?  She wants some prick stuck in her.  I can throw up, no problem right now.  Amy, what's wrong with you?  You don't like that word. 
[02:03:00]  I don't like the faces Jimmy's making when he says it.  Yeah, here's the problem with Schumer.  She doesn't know what to do with a prick.  She wants to stick in her.  Please.  Laura, you come here and I'll teach you how to come.  I'll shove the prick so far in you.  Fucking ears will fold.  Something tells me these girls figured out a way to go to New York  and not have to pay for a hotel room.  Or a meal.  Yeah, or a meal.  That's right.  They found out.  They learned how expensive New York is.  All of a sudden, you're going to get an invoice for daycare.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[02:03:30]  And they pay for Valtrex.  Oh, my God.  So you guys are going to come and have dinner with me?  Because I don't think they're going to talk dirty.  I think they're a little shy.  But I do think that they are troopers.  We are troopers.  I'm trying to Facebook request you, but I'm having major problems here.  Oh, no.  Maybe one of these girls will masturbate for us.  Oh.  Yeah, my kid actually does that a lot.  Oh, really?  Kim?  Well, I'll try.  Kim?  Kim, will you masturbate for, I don't know, a few hundred people? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  I just said Facebook requested you.  Oh.  Kim?  Scroll through more pictures there, Sam.  What's the matter with you?  Kim?  She was actually fingering herself right now.  Just in the sign of your voice.  All right.  All right.  Let me keep it sexy.  I want you to take your fingers.  I want you to put them in your cooter.  Swish it around in there like you're making butter.  Why would she be making butter?  Go in circles like an Amish lady making butter. 
[02:04:30]  Get in there with your cooter.  Circles.  Go big, deep circles.  Oh, God.  How wet and sloppy is it?  Finger, you cooter.  Oh, my God.  That is something a girl hears before her throat is slit.  No, I want you to do this.  This is not sexy.  It is sexy.  Take your finger, put it on your clit and go like back and forth.  Flick it.  Flick it like it's a roach on your stove. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, God.  I just Facebook requested one of these girls.  You all right, ladies?  That just made me want to go to Amish country.  You all right, girls?  Wait, it's Kim now.  Hi, Kim.  Kim, are you going to masturbate for us?  I heard you do that.  You don't masturbate.  You don't masturbate, huh?  You've not accepted my Facebook request.  I'm very hurt.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, there's some fishy shenanigans here.  I think they're just being silly.  They're just being silly. 
[02:05:30]  And I accept that.  I think they're high, but they're down to fuck.  That's my guess.  I think we should gamble on this and see if this happens.  I want some prick.  Yeah, but you know what?  Someone hasn't accepted my Facebook request.  That's no way to get a prick stuck in you.  That's because she's getting a million right now.  Oh, that's right.  It's true.  Yeah, I bet she's flooded.  Yeah.  How am I supposed to funnel cum into you?  Oh, shit.  If you don't accept my Facebook request, I can't funnel cum into you. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, yeah.  Ladies?  Why am I on our Facebook?  Still there?  People.  Yeah, why are you?  Oh, people are fucking up.  People.  Oh, okay.  Their line gave out.  Oh, the line gave out.  That battle.  The line gave out.  That means they hung up.  No, the line might have come up.  Oh, people are starting to.  They found their Facebook, did they?  Well, somebody just reminded me.  Their car is rolling off the road.  Yeah.  Somebody just reminded me that any of the listeners who are following me on Facebook 
[02:06:30]  can see that I just became friends with them.  Oh, right.  So they know who it is.  Oh, there you go.  Thanks.  And now you just told everybody.  Oops.  Just anybody who didn't realize.  Right.  Yeah, I know.  Why are you with the count?  We tend to take over Facebook pages.  Oops.  All right.  Hold on.  Take out the picture of Opie.  Horrible.  What?  What is happening there?  This kid is on.  I was thinking you had Sesame Place.  It looks like you're just creeping on some kid.  Fuck, I'm not your friend, Sam, on Facebook.  You like the count?  What's your name? 
[02:07:00]  Sam Roberts?  No, it's not Sam.  All right.  Just accept me real quick.  This is how we'll do this.  It's amazing how fucking much trouble you go through for an offered blowjob.  All right.  She's back.  Okay.  Let's cut to the chase.  Is this going down, Laura?  Yeah, it's definitely going down.  All right.  So how do we make this happen?  I told you we're coming to New York, and we're going to fuck the shit out of you.  Okay.  This is...  That was Opie.  This is Jim.  But if you come down here, I'll put you on your stomach, your back, your side.  I'll stick a prick in you from every angle. 
[02:07:30]  You'll be full of prick.  You'll have a prick in your pussy, a prick in your ass, a prick in your mouth.  You'll be all pricked out.  Well, that is exactly why I will come here.  Oh.  She's liking this.  She's still in, Jimmy.  Why don't you and your friend come in?  It's a sweet talk.  Yeah.  Why don't you guys come into the studio tomorrow?  I mean, I'm used...  Or when you can, like next week or whatever.  Well, you've got the Brigada date next weekend.  Yeah, just make sure I'm here.  Not to ruin everyone's time.  No, no, no.  I'm going, by the way. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, we're all going down to Atlantic City there, Laura.  A week from...  When are we going?  Saturday?  A week from Saturday and Sunday.  The both shows are sold out.  But you should come to the studio.  We'll all have a few laughs.  Oh, yeah.  Some laughs.  You guys can give them t-shirts.  A few fangs and a few fucks.  What's that?  Whoa.  I said a few laughs, a few drinks, and a few fucks.  Yeah, a few fucks.  And a few fucks.  Well, let's be more honest.  Half a fuck.  I'll do the best I can.  I'm an older gentleman.  Oh, yeah.  The best I can. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  Sometimes I try to hide the fact...  What's that?  You have to be going to be there.  It's Kim.  Yeah, Kim, Anthony will be there.  Of course I'll be there.  Anthony will absolutely be there.  Oh, yeah.  Being my prick.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Anthony's got a big sweaty prick.  Anthony's pubic hair actually looks like fucking Frank Whaley's hair in Swimming with Sharks.  It's all combed back and sweaty.  Oh, Jesus.  Anthony's got a lot of prick hair.  A prick? 
[02:09:00]  What's that?  Does he have a kickstand?  They call him Anthony kickstand?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  A big cock, yeah.  Yeah, he does.  Look out.  Look out.  Oh, my God.  All right, we still don't have anything figured out here for Jimmy.  Well, I mean, they think they're going to call...  I'm still trying to Facebook request these girls.  You guys might as well just...  No, I just accepted Jim's Facebook request.  Oh, thank you, Kim.  You are welcome.  That was very nice of you.  See how we're getting along?  This is going well. 
[02:09:30]  There you are.  Oh, there it's me.  I want Anthony to send me a request.  He will, but he's...  I don't have my computer here to do that with.  Somebody posted a picture of the devil licking Jesus' asshole.  Oh, God damn.  That's terrible.  Wow.  Are you avoiding me, Anthony?  What's up?  Are you avoiding me?  No, why would I do that?  I don't know.  Which one is this?  This is my Kim.  Does it matter?  I know.  This is really...  She's not...  What a couple of good girls. 
[02:10:00]  This is what we need.  More girls like you.  We need more girls like you.  Are we a good time?  We're a good time, right?  Yeah, you are a good time.  That's what we need.  I don't have enough girls that are good times.  I'd hate to be, you know, be given the run around.  You know?  Imagine that.  Oh, no.  After all this, you're like...  After all you've been through.  Yeah.  After all you've been through.  15 minutes?  It's like you ran a marathon.  Amy fucking rules.  Amy Schumer at Caroline starting tonight. 
[02:10:30]  Headlining.  Yeah, she's headlining.  Bring your pricks.  What do you guys want to do when we come to New York?  Light up the town.  Night on the town.  Yeah, paint the town red.  Yeah.  What are you kidding?  Just like your pussy after my prick is pulled out of it.  Red with pulp on it.  I like to call it purple on that, right, Griffidge?  Can you do what?  Can you paint the town purple instead of red?  Yeah, we can paint the town any color you'd like.  Let's paint it white with cum.  Oh, my God. 
[02:11:00]  I thought she said, let's watch the color purple.  I was like, she is sick.  This girl hates black people.  It's disturbing.  I want to blow you while she's shaving.  I'm thinking of cutting his throat.  Oh, my God.  Only best is Danny Glover on screen.  Eric, why are you in studio?  Iraq?  Hold on.  Iraq has stumbled in.  Has communicated.  Thank you.  Oh, you're a good bird.  Thank you, Iraq.  Okay, thanks.  Put it all together.  I can do it, Iraq.  One post it.  Yeah, collate that.  What's that, my angel? 
[02:11:30]  I have all these fire requests, people from your studio, because I have like 58 fire requests.  No, they're fans.  They're people from listening to the show, but not in the studio.  Uh-oh, Jim.  Better get the listeners off of these girls.  No, no.  They're all fucking assholes.  Yeah, don't accept them.  Say no.  Say no to everyone.  All right, guys.  Don't cock block.  I'm working here.  Oh, they're so cock block.  They are clearly cock blocking right now.  Yeah.  Well, I have your numbers, so I can, how do you say, I'll give you a jingle. 
[02:12:00]  And chlamydia.  Oh, my God.  Wait, are you guys friends with that Troy Dingser?  Dingsy?  Troy Dingsy?  I don't know who that is.  Oh, my God.  He just posted a disgusting picture of Jesus getting fucked in the ass.  Oh, well.  Well, he must be a Jew.  We were just chatting about that.  Yes, that's, uh, oh, boy, the devil sure is doing terrible things.  Yeah, but it looks like the devil has a delicate touch. 
[02:12:30]  He's gently holding the ass cheek open.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can see it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy, you're going to.  How do I know this call is going to end like the beginning of Detroit Rock City?  Oh, my God.  That's, nobody wants to see that.  Can I ask you guys one question?  Sure, baby.  Go on my Facebook and put it on my wall.  I am horrified. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, there's a lot of luck.  We've been looking, yeah.  Yeah, we don't know those people.  You should delete these horrible people.  Yeah, we don't know them at all.  They're terrible.  I don't go for this type of talk.  That's dead picture?  That's Anna Nicole Smith.  Yeah, but is that the dead picture?  I think it is.  What?  I never saw the dead picture of her.  I didn't either.  Is that it, really?  I don't think so.  No.  I don't think so.  I think that's just a different thing.  Yeah.  That's her just woofing.  Yeah, that's just.  This is woofing.  What the hell is going on?  Oh, God, I'm going to throw up.  No, these are wonderful girls. 
[02:13:30]  All right, listen.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look.  It's Lil Anthony.  That's the worst thing of all.  Isn't it terrible?  All right, ladies.  Yeah.  You had red hair?  Were you in the musical Annie?  I really do look like I should be seeing the sun come out tomorrow.  That wasn't your hair color, was it?  You should be seeing different strokes.  Yeah, that was.  Wow.  My hair had this reddish phase.  They're both really cool. 
[02:14:00]  So you girls will come to New York sometime in the next two weeks?  Yeah.  And we'll all hang out and have a meal, a good dinner.  Yeah, no, let me, you, and Jimmy, and Anthony, we're all going on a date.  Yeah.  It'll be a night to remember.  That's right.  You two can sit in the back and watch while me and Anthony jerk each other off.  That's the way that goes.  Oh, my friendship.  I would talk like Beretta.  I jerk him off and I go, that's the name of that tune.  I'm sure these girls love Beretta. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, right?  What?  I guess we should let them go, but we enjoyed chatting with you, and we'll talk soon.  Wait, wait, wait.  Choice, whatever his name is, he's listening.  He just puts it on my wall.  He goes, actually, it's Jesus in the dog's butt.  All right, well, the fans are going to be able to.  He sounds good.  You're going to have to start blocking people.  I'm going to talk block them.  Yeah.  I need to go.  He needs to be a boy.  All right.  Drive safe, ladies, all right?  All right.  We'll talk to you soon.  Bye-bye, girls.  Bye.  Kim and Laura. 
[02:15:00]  God, angels.  Two angels.  You like them, right, Amy?  I did.  I enjoyed those girls.  You know, what are the odds you're going to find a perfect soulmate on the phone like  that?  I smell family.  A hundred percent.  I smell something.  This is the beginning of a family.  Yes.  I mean, some of them have already forgot a family.  Pre-fab family with the kid.  Yeah.  So, you know what it is?  When you're really good at dirty talk, you just learn how to get them fucking sopping  and anticipating.  Oh, well, you had it going with the prick and funneling coming down.  I think we all felt affected.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  It's all felt affected in one way or another.  It changed the energy in the room.  Yeah.  A bunch of drooling cooters in this town.  You think there's a money thing going on there, Jimmy?  No.  They wouldn't have called it like that goofy if it was money.  No.  They're just being silly.  Why don't we take a break?  Amy Schumer's here.  Headlining Caroline's.  This is fucking huge.  Yes.  Very happy for Amy.  She's very, very funny.  As everybody knows.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  That is all right.  Amy Schumer, Caroline's starting tonight through Sunday, 212-757-4100.  Also, you're going to get a crew together to go see Amy. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you.  That's what I do.  That's what I do.  You hanging out?  Yeah.  Also, because Ty is coming in.  I heard.  Yeah.  We were at the premiere.  Pierre.  Yes.  Me, Amy, and our significance.  I don't know who you were with.  I was with a priest.  You were with a priest.  He's not my Lord.  And he was in priest garb and everything.  He was dressed up in priest garb.  Yeah.  A real priest?  A young priest.  No.  Fake?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it wasn't a real priest.  He was just dressed as a priest.  But, you know, he agreed to it.  It was an idiot.  It was cool.  Yeah.  And the movie we saw, The Innkeepers, and it was cool.  Definitely.  It was a lot of fun.  And we were going to talk to Ty West, the director, and Sarah Paxton.  And Sarah's here, too, from the movie.  Yeah, she was amazing.  She hot?  Yeah, she's really hot.  Yeah.  She's got a boyfriend?  I don't know.  No, she's dying to see your prick.  Yeah.  She wants to have cum funneled in her.  Give her your prick, Jimmy.  Yeah, I'll just put my prick right in her.  The face he makes when he says that, it's just anger. 
[02:17:00]  So serial killer.  I fuck from the side.  I put him on their side.  I straddle him from the side like a T-square.  I fuck the puss.  I like carpentry tool talk when you're fucking, oh, where's my plumb bob?  Oh, my God.  Bob via.  All right, we'll take a break, get Ty in here next.  Stay there.  Got Amy Schumer in studio.  Kaboom.  I'm telling you, man, we want to get a good turnout for Amy Schumer. 
[02:17:30]  She's headlining at Caroline's.  We love Caroline's.  We love Amy Schumer.  They don't have a lot of women headlining for whatever reason.  I'm starting to think that women are funny, by the way, finally, after all these years.  Oh, my God.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  There's a lot of female comics that are doing the job properly.  Yeah.  It's true.  I love female comics.  A bunch of my favorites are definitely up and coming.  Sarah was a...  Nikki Glaser.  I don't know Nikki's act, but she's funny. 
[02:18:00]  She's really funny.  Rachel Feinstein.  Marina Franklin.  You've got to check these girls out.  They're hilarious.  Maria is fucking funny, man.  So funny, right?  She used to warm up for Jimmy.  Yeah, Marina.  Marina, excuse me.  Yeah, Marina.  Marina, yes.  Let's bring in Ty and Ty West and Sarah Paxton.  And Sarah.  Yes, the movie, of course, The Inkeepers.  All right.  On video on demand.  Woo!  And then...  It's a starstruck.  In theaters, February 3rd.  I know, isn't it?  Like, oh, man.  Hey, Ty.  I know. 
[02:18:30]  It's like a whole other thing.  Hey.  Yeah.  I'm Amy.  I'm Sarah.  Loved you in the movie.  Thank you.  I heard all about it.  I was listening to the show.  Yeah, Amy was at the premiere.  Yeah.  That was fun, man.  It was really fun.  It was scary.  And I don't go to the movies for anything, because I hate going to the theater.  Yeah, you looked weird in the movie.  I know.  It's like all squirmy and stuff.  But it is cool seeing, like, everybody reacting to it, you know?  Yeah, we had a good screening last night at this new place in Brooklyn called The Nighthawk.  Yeah.  Which is in Williamsburg.  You've got to talk right into that, Mike. 
[02:19:00]  Sorry, Ty.  No, no worries.  We watch it.  And so it's like this kind of movie theater, excuse me, a place where you can order food  and drinks while you watch the movie.  Oh, that's the best.  And it's like Grazio, Williamsburg, so I think it'll do really well.  But we had a really good turnout, and it was similar to the Lincoln Center.  It was a good vibe.  Yeah.  Yeah, I saw people tweeting about it.  How's that working out with people being able to drink in the movie theaters?  Oh, it's a disaster.  It depends on what they order.  If it's a bunch of Heineken, it's going to be a good movie.  If you hear a lot of old English in Cold 45, lots of talking. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, it could be an issue.  You don't get as much of that.  Well, yeah, yeah.  Just a bunch of hot seats.  Can we get the basics out?  What's the movie about, Ty?  The movie's about these two nerds that work in a haunted hotel, and they want to get proof  that it's haunted before it goes out of business.  And Sarah Paxton is our main nerd.  Main nerd.  My dear.  And she starts doing some ghost hunting, trying to get some evidence, and she gets in over  her head.  So it's sort of like a, I mean, it's a horror movie, but it has a sense of humor to it.  And it's sort of about these minimum wage type people who get in over their heads. 
[02:20:00]  And it was a big kind of response to those ghost hunter shows, because I watch those shows  all the time.  And there's about four of them on TV, and they're in probably season four, each of them.  They're really successful.  But they've never found a fucking ghost ever.  Nothing happened.  I can't believe it's still on.  And what other job can you fail at every week and get another series?  You're basically telling everyone ghosts don't exist. 
[02:20:30]  Great.  Yeah, they prove the color argument to their show.  I like the promos, though, make you think that, wow, they finally found something.  Yeah, every time.  It's like, what's that?  Oh, my God!  Oh!  Next week.  And you're like, ah, and then you watch it, and you realize the guy spilt his coffee.  That was the scream.  So I always thought, even though these people were like, there's nobody better at ghost hunting  than these people, if they actually found a ghost, they would just freak the fuck out.  Yeah, what would they do?  I don't know what to do, and just run away.  So that's sort of what happens here in the movie.  Quite the gist of what goes on, because as you guys are going around the hotel looking 
[02:21:00]  for something with various electronic equipment and recorders and stuff, I was looking, going,  I would be freaking out just walking around the place.  Oh, gosh.  And you guys are kind of courageous with that, but the second something starts happening,  that's when you start freaking out.  Yeah.  It's like, but what were you looking for?  You know, it's like, ah, I didn't expect to see this shit!  You know, then you get scared.  All the preparation out the window.  I think it's just scary when you don't know what you're looking for.  My sister and I, we went to a bed and breakfast. 
[02:21:30]  We went to Lizzie Borden's house.  Oh, great.  You know, the chick who killed her.  Yeah, she hacked her parents up with an axe.  Killed her parents with an axe.  You can stay at the house she murdered her parents in, and I left.  How much time has to go by before that's an attraction?  Not much.  Can I stay at the Casey Anthony house?  Yeah.  Yeah.  OJ, knock knock.  OJ house.  OJ, knock to die.  Right, almost there.  OJ, OJ is almost there.  That lovely Colorado house.  That's right.  So you can turn into a bed and breakfast.  You have to be nice skiing while you're in town.  Yes.  A little cowboy hat.  Some bagels. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, it sounds great.  Did you see, was House of the Devil your first movie?  No, it wasn't.  That's the movie I did before this.  Yeah.  It's actually my third movie.  I love that movie.  Did you see the movie?  Oh, my God.  What's the name of it?  House of the Devil.  So good.  Do you write and direct these both?  I do, yes.  Do you find that you would rather direct your own stuff because you don't trust other people  to do it?  Yes.  I get sent a lot of scripts and it's very hard for me to, it's, it's, because writing  and directing and to some degree editing are just filmmaking to me.  So when you, when you read someone else's script, you're kind of like, well, I don't  know what the fuck he's thinking. 
[02:22:30]  Right.  But when you write it yourself, if anyone has a question for you, you're like, well, I  have the answer because I made it up.  And I also just, the kind of movies that I like are the movies by writer directors because  I feel like there's always like a voice to those movies and you can, you can tell  it's a Coen Brothers movie or you can tell it's a Terry Gilliam movie.  Or you can tell it's because they have this sort of like, I don't know, auteurish vibe  to them.  And those are the kind of filmmakers I like.  So that's, I don't know, for the process, it's important.  Right.  The process.  Plus there's no writer.  They say, you're bastardizing my, my work.  What are you doing?  Give him a shit about it. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  Because writers get very precious.  I'm not a very precious person.  So like, if Sarah's like, this line sucks, I'm like, I know.  Let's not say it.  Then don't say it.  I didn't know until you said it, but it's, it's not good.  Did you direct Precious?  I wish.  I wish.  So if she changes a lot or you, one of your actors wants to change something, you're cool  with that?  Absolutely not.  That's great.  No.  I think it's the kind of thing is that like, I mean, maybe you can talk about it more,  but I think you just gotta, you listen to it.  And if it sounds like bogus, you can't do it.  You know, I think that's the easiest. 
[02:23:30]  I don't know why it should be a bigger deal.  That's why in, in the innkeepers, the dialogue is very natural.  I like that too.  And it's not a movie where it's, uh, you know, the, the, the opening scene has to  have some kind of a horrible, uh, nightmarish quality to it, or else it's not a horror movie.  Like it's fun.  It's, it's two people and they're in a, looks like a pretty shitty situation as far as their  life goes.  And then it, it builds into this, uh, really horrific, scary story.  And, uh, the visuals also, man, you, you hit on the stuff I hate in, in horror movies. 
[02:24:00]  I got a hot, I literally like a little fag.  I got to hide my eyes because I get nightmares that twisted fucking body.  Isn't supposed to move that way.  Shit.  But it gets me every time someone, someone's not there.  And then they're there.  That stuff gets me all the time.  Yeah.  And there's a horrific scene like that, uh, in, in your movie, uh, that I, I literally jumped  and did a Jesus Christ. 
[02:24:30]  There's an older, older gentleman that is a bit spooky in the movie.  Yeah, that, that is not fun.  No, especially if you've been molested.  What?  Who said that?  That was not me.  You're possessed, I think.  Adios mio.  Is this your first movie, Sarah?  No, it's not.  You've done a lot of stuff?  I started acting when I was six.  Oh.  Oh.  That's adorable.  So I should probably have a IMDB thing if I leave it, I don't.  Anything else we would know you in? 
[02:25:00]  Probably not, unless you have like a teenage daughter.  Yeah.  You've done a lot of films.  You were in, you were in, you were in, you were in, you were in, you were in, you were  in, you were in, you were in Last House on the Left, right?  I was in Last House on the Left.  No, you've worked a lot more than the teen stuff.  Yeah, well, Last House on the Left I did a couple years ago, and ever since then I've  been doing like more horror-y.  When I met Sarah, she did this movie called Aquamarine where she plays a mermaid, and every  16-year-old girl is obsessed with Aquamarine, so when we would walk down the street, like  I wasn't that familiar with Sarah, but we'd walk down the street and you'd just hear 
[02:25:30]  like, oh my God, what are you doing in Torrington, Connecticut?  Are you really a mermaid?  And when I met Sarah, she was like, well, I can play a mermaid or I can get ass-raped.  Those are my two biggest stars.  That's great.  They're like, are you funny?  And I'm like, well, you know, once you've been ass-raped, people don't think you're funny.  That's amazing.  A lot of mermaids don't even have assholes.  People have a lot to work with.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  She's so good.  I really liked how the characters, you know, you and Pat Healy, right?  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  The male lead, you guys were like co-workers, and there's a little sexual chemistry, but  really you guys are just co-workers, you're equals.  You don't really get, there's always like this kind of flirty.  Vi, where it's either the guy or the girl's in the lead, but you guys are just your friends.  I see more of him having a little crushy on her.  Yeah.  Well, he has a penis.  She's just kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what happens.  I'm just kidding.  We have a really good bio on Sarah.  There's nothing on time, but let me read this.  Excuse me.  This might take a while.  Oh, wow.  It's a really good job here.  Oh, let's hear that.  Sarah reportedly just found out the Bill Paxton is a distant relative of hers. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, wow.  And he pluralized the S in hers.  Who wrote that?  It's worthless.  There's another fun fact.  Sarah wrote it.  Factoids.  Sarah has also starred in films including Last House on the Left, and in parentheses the  remake, which is like a subtle fuck you to Sarah, which I need to be careful.  She's a million years old.  And Shark Night 3D.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That's the bio.  Were you scared of the sharks? 
[02:27:00]  No.  They were fake.  Fake sharks.  Puppet sharks.  Okay.  But, you know, you never know.  That's true.  Well, you know, there's a lot of shark nannigans.  Right?  There you go.  Shark nannigans.  Oh, I got Chip is in here.  Yeah.  Hi.  Yeah.  Like everybody's just getting up in fins.  Oh, I don't know, Chip.  That doesn't really, that didn't really make sense.  So wait.  Now, as an actor, what do you do?  This is really a terrible question, which is corny, but when you're doing a role, are you  like one of those method actors, you kind of become the person, or are you just  like, I'm Sarah, now I'm not, now I'm Sarah? 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, it's like that.  Oh, you like that?  Yeah.  I'm Sarah, now I'm not, now I'm not.  But I mean, are you able to just go in and out of it on the shoot?  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I mean, for this, it was pretty easy, because I was just playing like a more like  George Costanza-y version of myself.  Like, we would do takes, and like, Ty would be, you'd say, go more Costanza, and so I'd  just really go crazy with it.  But other than that, I was just kind of being myself.  The thing about Sarah that's funny is I wasn't that familiar with her, and if you  like Google image Sarah, it's all these very glamorous photos, and as it should be. 
[02:28:00]  And I was like, I don't know, she doesn't really seem like the minimum wage job vibe.  Just say it, Hispanic.  Yes.  Mexican and Jewish.  And when I met her, she's like this goofball.  And you wouldn't, even now, I don't think you're portraying yourself as much as you are.  I'm keeping it, I'm holding it.  And so when I discovered she was like a goofball, I just felt like I needed to exploit it.  So in the movie, she's very clumsy, and it's hopefully very charming in that way.  Because it's really about, it's like, hopefully a charming ghost story, because it's, you know, 
[02:28:30]  I'm either qualified to direct movies or be a busboy.  I don't know how to do anything else.  I have no trades.  I have no skills.  No skills.  It's either make my own movies, or if I fail at this, I go back to being a waiter.  Yeah.  But I'm, like, forever charmed by, like, the minimum wage jobs, and that sort of, like,  insular world of, like, your work friends, and the weird barter system you have with,  like, the coffee shop next door.  Right.  It's like, they'll give you free coffee if you help them out.  And so the movie is very much that vibe that turns into a ghost story.  Yeah.  That's what I liked about it, too, is the build of the characters and stuff. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, people like to say slow burn.  That's people's favorite.  Oh, is that what they call it?  It's just non-stop.  That's all they say.  Slow burn man.  And did you know Lena Dunham?  She was the one working at the coffee shop.  Were you guys friends?  Yeah.  Oddly enough, have you seen her movie Tiny Furniture?  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's great.  It's almost based on me, which is a little unflattering.  Oh, wow.  But no, Lena and I are good friends.  I'm going to get out of here.  You know, I lived at Lena's house when I was making House of the Devil for, like,  two weeks until her parents kicked me out.  But Lena and I are very good friends.  Oh, cool.  And, yeah, so I had her come out and do that. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, she was hysterically annoying.  She's unbearable.  Oh, just horrid.  She's on an HBO show now.  Really?  Which is intense.  Yeah.  She wrote, directed, stars, and executive produced it.  It's called Girls.  It comes out in April.  Oh, okay.  There's a plug for Lena.  You owe me.  Yeah.  I auditioned for it.  Thanks for nothing, Lena.  Oops.  You've been in an amazing amount of stuff.  I didn't get anything.  The Boys of Abu Ghraib is not out yet.  Is that about the prison?  Do you play Lindy England?  No.  I'm just the girlfriend back home in that one.  Oh, but it's about what happened? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Oh, hot.  I'm one of the detainees, actually.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, they really wanted to go off.  She's at the top of the pyramid.  Obviously.  Look at his face.  Who's playing Lindy England?  I think it's John Larroquette.  Good reference.  But I'm pissed off I didn't see this.  I do have it, and I will watch it tonight.  It's a video on demand.  Yeah.  You could see it now, and then February 3rd in theaters.  It's about time they're putting good movies on demand.  Yeah.  I like that whole thing, too.  There was a time it was either movies that were already in theaters or movies that weren't 
[02:30:30]  really worth it they just threw on there, but that's not the deal anymore.  Yeah.  I mean, I think for indie movies like ours, it's tough because the world of indie sort  of, I guess, art house theaters have gotten so small that we come out February 3rd in  about 20 or so major cities.  So if you live in a major city, you can go see the movie.  But if you don't, you're fucked.  And the thing about VOD is you can just, if you're in Des Moines, Iowa, and you want  to see the movie, you can just click your TV, and there it is.  I think Kevin Smith finally made people realize that you're going to see cool movies on demand 
[02:31:00]  that aren't necessarily in theaters first.  Yeah.  He made a big enough stink with Red State that I think people paid attention to.  Finally, they're like, oh, okay, wait, this might be worth watching, even though it  wasn't in theaters first.  Right.  Is it hard to get distributed by a major distributor everywhere?  Like, what do you do?  You show them your movie, and they're like, no, we don't think that this will, what happens?  How does it work?  Well, we made this movie independently, so there's a company that gave us money to make  the movie.  We made it, and then we premiered it at the South by Southwest Film Festival, and a lot  of distributors will go there trying to find stuff, because they can't make movies on 
[02:31:30]  their own anymore for some reason.  So they try to buy them for as cheap as possible, and then make as much money as possible.  Now, I've done two movies back-to-back with this company, Magnolia Pictures, which is like  Mark Cuban's company, and they're amazing, and I have such a great relationship with  them.  And they're like an indie company that, like, kind of every year, if people see top  ten lists, they always have about three movies on there.  Generally, they get movies nominated for Oscars.  It's just like, they have a really good slate, so it's a good company to be with.  And there's a few other companies like that, like IFC is sort of similar.  And then there's like the Sony Pictures Classics and the studios that try to buy stuff. 
[02:32:00]  But, you know, our movie, as much as I don't, I think it's commercial, and it's funny  and it's scary, you know, the commercial horror movies are like lowest common denominator  movies, they're just like, everyone getting killed every ten minutes.  So we don't quite fit that mold.  And I think it's hard for a company like that to justify spending $40 million marketing a  movie that doesn't have, like, you know, tits and their heads getting cut off every five  minutes.  I like this so much more.  This was like right up my alley.  Those other movies, it's all, I feel like it's all just geared toward, like, teenagers 
[02:32:30]  to keep their attention.  Like, don't look away, or you're going to miss somebody getting their, like, clit bitten off  for something.  Oh, well, what movie is this?  Sorry, I guess I'm reading from my dream journal again.  That's the Boys of Abu Ghraib.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I loved it.  And it's frustrating when you watch this.  All they're doing is remakes.  All they're doing is take, like, you know, straw dogs and shit.  They're just retaking old scripts because they're such uncreative douches.  And it's like independent movies are the only ones that feel original at all.  Yeah, the thing, though, is, like, it's kind of on us because people go and support 
[02:33:00]  the remake.  So when a remake comes out and it's number one at the box office, they're going to remake  more.  Right.  It's that simple.  So, like, us as, like, consumers, we've become so lazy.  We're so used to everything coming to us that if there's a smaller movie, we don't really  seek it out or we're too lazy to do that, which is what's good about VOD is you don't  have to seek it out as much.  Yeah.  You know, you can just sort of, like, sit on your, dude, you got your coffee, boom, you  know, and that's all it takes.  Oh, you can make it?  Okay.  Dude.  Dude.  Dude, boom, you got VOD, and hopefully I get HIV. 
[02:33:30]  I can lose some weight.  You know what?  Dude, boom, you got your dogs, you got your stomach.  You know what?  A lot of the best movies I've watched lately have been movies I didn't even know were out  there, didn't know the name of it, who's in it, and then you're just kind of going around  because it's such shit on television and stuff that you're like, all right, I'll give this  a try, and then you realize, wow, that was really good.  And I realize no one has seen this.  Yeah.  You know, it's odd, but hopefully that turns around.  Movies are so bad.  I've actually just started, I watched a drunk driving documentary on the Taconic Parkway. 
[02:34:00]  And it was my home movie.  You were great in that.  You drink.  I've actually just started watching documentaries now because I have no faith.  They're great, but there's no really good movies, so it's refreshing.  Netflix has been really good for documentaries because documentaries that you may not be familiar  with.  Netflix has just put them right in front of your face to be like, oh, that's interesting.  I'd watch that.  And HBO On Demand, too, I like.  There are some subjects you'd just be like, what?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Like Winnebago Man.  History of Mud.  You see the Winnebago Man documentary?  No, what's that?  It's a long story. 
[02:34:30]  It was a viral video, and then a guy decided to make a movie about him.  That wasn't that long of a story.  Oh, man.  You have a short attention span.  That's like a novel.  That was like a novel.  In my brain, that was a novel.  Can we go back?  That's funny.  What the fuck?  Oh, I explained it perfectly.  You certainly did.  All right.  Sean wants us to ask Sarah about the rape scene in The Last House on the left.  What about it?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Cool. 
[02:35:00]  He says it was crazy in capital letters.  Crazy.  And it goes on and on and on.  It did.  It went on and on.  I was like, oh, my God.  Was it hot?  This is like the longest rape ever.  Well, the rape in Clockwork Orange was kind of hot.  The rape in Clockwork, yeah, because they didn't really show her being hurt.  Right, yeah.  They just show the snipping and her, you know, her beautiful body, but they don't show her  being like, well, they do show her being slapped.  Irreversible is quite the rape scene.  That's the most uncomfortable one I've ever watched.  He was at the screening last night, and he came up and introduced himself, and I'm like, 
[02:35:30]  rape?  Yeah, people love me right now.  The rape scene, Irreversible, is the worst rape scene I've ever seen.  It's worse than I Spit on Your Grave.  What Spit on Your Grave is a nasty rape scene.  Who was in that movie?  It's French, and it goes in reverse, and I don't know any of the actors in it, but it  was a pretty brilliant movie, and there's a rape scene in a tunnel, like, where you walk  underground and get across the street almost, and it's...  It's like nine minutes, and it doesn't cut.  It's horribly upsetting.  Wow.  Really?  Very, very upsetting rape scene.  And Sarah's rape was pretty brutal? 
[02:36:00]  Long?  It was long, yeah.  There might have been some funneling of cum, as possible.  There was some funneled cum.  Yeah, it was.  Some prick.  There was some funnel cake.  It was kind of awesome.  I love funnel cake.  Who raped you in the movie?  Like, what was the...  Garrett Dillahunt.  No, no, but what was his character, and why would he...  Oh, his name was Krug, and he was, like, the mean, psychotic, weirdo guy, and he,  yeah, he didn't like me very much, I guess.  We didn't get along, so he, like, shoved my face in the dirt.  I don't know.  That day, he was, like, really freaked out.  He was, like, because I've known this guy since I was, like, 14, you know, like, last 
[02:36:30]  year, and he was, like, and he was, like, oh, my God, you know, I can't do this.  You know, you're, like, a kid.  I can't do it.  And I was, like, listen, dude, like, fucking shoved my face in the dirt.  Like, get in there.  Like, let's do this shit.  And so, yeah, I guess people...  You were, like, do it, pussy.  Wow.  He was, like, oh, my God.  It's really for, like, a mainstream movie.  It's pretty uncomfortable.  As much as you could probably push it.  Is it tough to film a rape scene, Sarah?  Yeah, it was, like, exhausting, you know, like, crying and, like, struggling in the dirt. 
[02:37:00]  It was just, like, I was, like, really tired.  Like contract negotiations.  Yeah, no kidding.  Crying, struggling.  What did it take to shoot that scene?  A day.  A whole day of rape.  A whole day of rape.  In Africa.  In Africa.  Amy, can you handle that?  A whole day of rape.  I have.  And I apologize to the man I did it to.  Oh, God.  Sarah's being paid, at least.  Yeah, that's true.  What are you working on now, Tim?  I have this science fiction movie that I'm doing next. 
[02:37:30]  I have a movie at Sundance.  And then after that's over, I'm hoping to go off and do this space movie.  Space movie.  But it's weird.  I mean, it's a tough time for indie movies.  People don't like to invest as much anymore.  Because they see movies like Paranormal Activity get made for $100,000 and make $150 million.  It's like, where's my millions?  And they're like, let's do everything like that.  And it's like, that's like you hit roulette big one time.  And they're like, we should always do that.  Let's always play 36.  Exactly.  No.  It's a weird time.  It's, you know, and as you were saying, Jim, like, movies, they're not so good right now. 
[02:38:00]  They're terrible.  Movies are pretty good.  But the majority of movies, it's like, you know, as a filmmaker, you kind of have this existential  crisis of like, oh, like, what are we?  Like, I don't really want to direct comic book movies, but that's like all there is to aspire  to anymore.  And so that's kind of like, what are we going to do?  And Christopher Nolan does such a good job with those.  It's going to be hard to top what he does because he really makes them interesting and  not comic book-y.  He's the guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But like, yeah, it's weird.  And then I see movies occasionally that are like really amazing that like, they kind of  humble you or they almost intimidate me to want to quit making movies. 
[02:38:30]  And you're like, I'll never be as good as that.  Can you name one?  What have I seen this year that's good?  I really liked Stuff for Everybody.  I liked Melancholia a lot.  Yeah, that was fucked up, man.  I haven't seen that.  That was really good.  That is still with me.  That fucked me up.  Isn't that just the most like, the movie ends and you're like, great, let me just shoot  myself.  Oh, by the way, I watched that with my mother.  That added to the horror of the holidays.  Oh, God.  It was like suicide pack.  It is a feel good movie.  I've never even heard of this film.  It's aptly titled. 
[02:39:00]  Is that Magnolia a picture?  It is Magnolia.  It's a Lars Van Trier movie with Kirsten Dunst and she's depressed and it's like really  unpleasant to watch, but it's pretty amazing.  It's so odd.  It just starts out so weird.  You're like, all right, a slow burn, you know, you kind of, you know, the characters  and you, and I reached a point where I was like, what the fuck is going on?  You know, just these, but really breathtaking slow motion scenes at the beginning.  And you're like, what's in the middle of the movie where she gets really depressed and  she's just like, can't get out of bed.  And you almost like, you're like, oh, I got to turn this fucking movie off. 
[02:39:30]  Like you feel the same way.  Yeah.  I took a break.  Yeah.  You're just like, it's exhausting.  I took a break.  I did.  It makes you feel, it really takes over your own emotions.  I couldn't smile.  Yeah.  You have a few filmmakers that can do that consistently.  You know, I don't, I hate Bjork.  Excuse me, but.  You do?  I do.  I do.  Well, I don't know Bjork, but we probably would get along.  But, um, the, uh, Dancer in the Dark, like the end of that movie is so uncomfortable.  I watched that on a plane to Spain.  Ooh, that's a rough watch.  Everybody watched Dancer in the Dark together.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  It's horrible.  There's so few filmmakers that are in that much control of what they're doing.  And your next movie is about space?  It is.  It's a, um, it's about a woman that's doing pharmaceutical testing in space.  And, um, she's by herself and she discovers she's pregnant.  It's so vast out there.  There's so many stars.  Oh, wow.  Sometimes you want to just show the director what you can do.  That's good.  That's good.  Sometimes you just want to show what you can do.  I like what you're doing with your hands.  You just want to show he knew the word vast.  Can you imagine how much all of those would weigh? 
[02:40:30]  I cannot.  His hands are straight out.  He does have a hand problem.  Sometimes, you know, Brett Ratner was in.  I showed him a couple of things.  Sometimes you want the directors just to see what you can do.  He is.  Oh, my God.  The Yankee Peddler Hotel, the one in the movie, there's kind of a strange story about  that because apparently it is haunted to some extent.  Yeah.  When we made my previous movie, House of the Devil, we stayed at the Yankee Peddler because  it was just the cheapest place to house the crew near where we were shooting. 
[02:41:00]  And we would make this satanic horror movie out in the middle of nowhere.  But weirder stuff would happen back at the hotel.  And, you know, I don't really believe in ghosts, so I'm not sure.  Like, when I hear, like, a door open by itself, I don't jump to ghosts.  You know?  You think wind first.  I go wind, and then maybe shitty building, and then maybe someone walked away, and then  I'll get to ghosts.  But the whole town is obsessed with a place that thinks it's haunted.  The staff thinks it's haunted.  There really is a guy.  The front desk has a ghost hunting website, like in the movie.  And our whole cast and crew started to believe it was haunted. 
[02:41:30]  And I didn't think much of it.  There's just, like, goofy stories from House of the Devil.  And then a year later, I wanted to make a ghost movie, and I was doing this studio movie.  I got fired.  And I was like, you know what?  That's good.  I should just do my own thing anyway.  So I just was like, well, I want to do a ghost movie, and I lived one.  So I don't want to just write that because I know we could go back to that place and film  because I know it exists.  And I realized I wrote myself into a corner because if they had said no, then it was a colossal  waste of time.  Yeah.  You base it on that place pretty much.  But they said yes, and they had a window before their busy season.  Now they're in foreclosure, so I don't know how busy it was.  It's so annoying. 
[02:42:00]  And so we had to schedule around a few wedding parties and proms, which the prom was very  excited about Sarah being there.  And, um, yeah.  We just slunk in and got the movie made.  And, um, I don't know, it's a weird place.  Everyone, Sarah has some stories about creepy stuff happening.  Yeah?  Isn't it just, like, weird shit happening?  Lots of rape.  A lot of rape.  Ghost rape.  I was like, you know, ghosts with benefits.  I was like, again?  But, uh, just, like, weird shit happening.  Like, um, I'd be sitting in my room and all of a sudden my bathroom door would, like, violently 
[02:42:30]  fly open.  And I was like, uh, this is the wind.  Creepy.  Like, really?  But not like a wind kind of just blowing it open?  It wasn't like, it was like, fly open?  That's fucked up.  Yeah, it was fucked up.  And then, um, the room in the movie that's, like, the most haunted room in the story is,  like, the honeymoon suite.  And the only reason I picked it is because it was on the third floor at the end of a  hallway and it was big enough to do a dolly shot.  Like, no thought went into it besides, like, all right, this will work.  Let's get to this later.  So we shoot the movie.  And then after the movie, I find out that the room is the most haunted room in the hotel 
[02:43:00]  in real life.  Now, that's a coincidence.  But of all the rooms, it's odd when you add everything up.  And then when I made House of the Devil, um, this, Dee Wallace, who was in Cujo and she  was a mom in E.T.  Oh, God, yeah.  She was like Chewbacca at the end of, uh, at the end of, uh, what was the, the howling?  Was she in the howling?  Yes.  What for you?  Yeah, she is in the howling.  Um, which she, you know, almost gets raped in the beginning.  So we can tie it in.  More rape.  Ooh, talk glory.  She's great.  But she also, what I didn't know about Dee is she has a very small scene in House of  the Devil.  And I went up to her room when she came to the hotel and I was like, oh, it's so great to  meet you.  I'm glad you could come out. 
[02:43:30]  Uh, you know, this hotel's a trip.  They say it's haunted.  I don't really know.  And she was like, it is haunted.  And I was like, okay.  And she was serious.  And then I discover, because she tells me, I mean, she's a spiritual healer now.  And she opens this thing and she has all these crystals and she starts, and I'm like, what's  happening?  Like, how far are we going to go with this?  And then she starts communicating ghosts the entire time she's there.  And, um, so there's a character in my movie that's, it's not based on her because Dee Wallace  is like one of the nicest people I've ever met.  And the character in the movie that is the actress that is a psychic is an asshole. 
[02:44:00]  So it's like, I always very, very cautious to say Dee Wallace because it's like people  will think, oh, Dee Wallace, she's like a sweetheart.  But the Kelly McGillis character in the movie is not so much.  Um, but that's where I got the idea because Dee, I, I got forced to sit there and, and  have be, be read by this.  And I don't believe that stuff, but it's the closest I've ever come.  It was weird.  Yeah.  I would pawn her off on other people, like to give him a reading.  And then everyone got creeped out because I don't know.  It was, it was, what were some of the stuff she was saying that made it seem weird to 
[02:44:30]  you?  She kept saying that, like the thing that weirded me out is like, she kept saying, you  have to make this decision about like a girl.  And I didn't know what she was talking about.  Also, I didn't believe anything she was talking about.  So I was like, okay, but the house, the devil is about one girl.  So I'm like, well, maybe it's something which I, and she's like, it's not that you'll  know what it is.  And I was like, I won't know, but we'll just keep going on.  And she kept saying to me every day, and even after she left, she would email me.  And you're like, all right.  I get it.  And then like halfway through the process, we would drive out to this, um, this location. 
[02:45:00]  There's no service.  So when you would come back from set in the morning, your phone would blow up with all  your voicemails.  And there was someone that I, that I dated for a while that I, that I hadn't talked to  in like seven months.  Like we just weren't talking.  And I started getting these messages, like these 30 minute long crazy person messages.  And they were like, they would end.  And the next one would start with, I got cut off.  And they would come.  Hi, Ty.  You know, uh.  How was you calling me?  Yeah, believe me.  Oh, Christ.  Maybe we know the same person. 
[02:45:30]  Two months shy of nine months.  I was, yeah, I was, what do you think they were calling about?  No, thank God.  I sent you the money.  We took care of it.  Okay, good, good.  But, uh.  That is a late term.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here's a trip.  Have a nice fall.  Hey, we'll go down to the free clinic.  Get one of those abortions.  Isn't this great?  Isn't this great?  So, um, but they just kept coming every day.  And then on the, at the airport on the way home, I finally was like, I'll call her.  And then we sort of like, I guess, reconciled or whatever.  I don't know if that's what Dee was talking about.  A decision about a girl? 
[02:46:00]  It's something.  But she would say to other people stuff that would make them uncomfortable.  And, uh, but what I can say about it is that when she was doing it, I have no doubts that  she believed it 100%.  Like, I don't think she's like, I'm doing this con of spiritual training.  Right.  I was like, this woman 100% believes what she's doing.  And so it was pretty interesting.  And the fact that, like, the crew thought the place was haunted, weird things were happening.  I still don't believe in ghosts, because to me, I have to see a ghost before I would believe.  And be scared.  So you ain't afraid of no ghosts. 
[02:46:30]  I ain't afraid of no ghosts.  But it's as close as I've ever come.  That is odd, though, to have, uh, written a movie and you're making the movie and staying  in a hotel and then make a movie out of the experience of staying in a hotel while you  made a movie.  Yeah, especially in like, I know offense to Torrington, Connecticut, but it's sort of a  shithole.  And it's like, it's really bleak.  She was cray.  No, I'm taking it.  She was cray.  She was cray.  And to go there and spend two months there and then go back again with the whole crew  and we're like, what are we doing back here? 
[02:47:00]  Why would we do this?  Why didn't we pick Miami?  And it's funny, like, the places that were in business either went out of business or  turned into a new company that went out of business.  And it's just one of those weird places, like, it's something like Allentown, PA, where  it's just like, whatever their industry was is so far gone that they're just trying  to hang on.  But it's, now that I've said it's a shithole, we were very warmly welcome there and it's  great.  It's just, it's a bleak place.  Like, it's a weird place to spend two months.  How hard is it to just get a location like that? 
[02:47:30]  It must be, I mean, maybe not like that, but it seems to me like you'd get a lot of people  just going, no, go away.  Why?  Don't they want money?  Well, here's the way it works is either they want money and they say yes and then they  don't really know what a movie is.  And then you show up with 60 people walking through their house and you're like, this  isn't what I signed up for.  And you're like, actually, it's exactly what you signed up for.  And then it gets really uncomfortable.  But for me, the biggest paranoia I have on making a movie is that we're going to lose  a major location.  I did a movie that I tried to take my name off of that I got totally fucked up. 
[02:48:00]  And I did it in North Carolina and we were shooting for eight days at the University  of North Carolina.  And then they found out what the content of the movie was and they wouldn't let us shoot  there anymore.  And it was our second week of shooting.  And I remember sitting on the front steps with the DP and the producer came up and  was like, we're just going to call it a day and go home.  And I was like, wow, why wouldn't they let you shoot anymore?  That's director of photography.  Well, because it's not double.  They found out that there was like a prom with a dead baby in the trash can and full  frontal discharging male nudity.  And they just were like, that's not the kind of business we want to be in. 
[02:48:30]  So how many more weeks did you have to shoot there?  We were supposed to shoot there for a week and then go back to shooting other places.  But we were going to lose that whole week there, which is a huge chunk of the movie.  And it became the producers like, I think we just have to call insurance and say this  movie's done.  And then me and Elliot got in a van and drove around to all the other schools and found  other locations and somehow pulled a 24 hour day and made it, pulled it together, which  was really triumphant.  But I was sitting there and it was like, wow.  And that was my first big movie.  It was probably the biggest movie to date.  Like it was a sequel and it was something that like, it was like studio-ish. 
[02:49:00]  And I was like on top of the world and like, it just was like, wow, this is all going  away.  And then the sad irony is then we made it through and had a great experience.  And then they took the movie away from me and re-edited it from scratch.  And we got a huge fight.  I tried to take my name off the movie.  So it was like, what a weird, complicated process.  Yeah, you fight so hard.  When you write a movie, do you see it like the beginning, the middle, the end?  Where do you go like, fuck, this hotel was really cool.  They say it's haunted.  And then you see a scene first.  How does it unfold for you normally?  Um, I, I just, I think of like a, uh, something that I think would be a good idea for a movie. 
[02:49:30]  And then I just sort of, um, I write down all the, like the major, like, this is how  it starts.  This is how, like you said, beginning, middle and end.  And then I, I just make it up as I go along and just sort of wing it.  And I write very quickly because if I, if I take a long time, I get really insecure  and I want to give up.  So like everyone was like, I started writing a script and I got 30 pages and then I got  a better idea.  And it's like, that's what happens to everybody.  But you got to just keep plowing through because it's a really miserable experience.  So I try to not take more than four or five days to write a movie.  Like I just don't leave the house because I know that it's like, it's not that hard 
[02:50:00]  to write a movie.  It's just really easy not to.  It's sort of like exercise.  Like it's not that hard to go running, but like it sucks.  So you don't ever want to do it.  That's how I feel writing a movie is.  So I just forced myself to do it like it's a job.  And, um, generally there's a moment when you're almost like you, you print it out and  you're like weird 78 pages already.  And you kind of get a second wind.  Um, and that's what helps me, but I, I, I just make it up.  I go in order because that's the way my brain works.  I started a horror film and I got to, it was a moonless night and there were ghosts all 
[02:50:30]  over the darn place and I got stuck.  It's awful.  You should have him go to the ghost emporium.  Ghosts.  There's ghosts here.  Oh my God.  It's hard, man.  I've written like a half hour thing.  It's very difficult because it starts to come undone at one point.  You're like, where the fuck am I going?  I went off on a tangent.  This stinks. 
[02:51:00]  What my original idea blows.  It's awful.  When you start writing something and you think about the original idea was shitty.  Like you said, you're like 30 pages and I got a better idea.  But that, I don't know if it's true.  Like, I don't know, like your idea might've been good, but like the insecure, it just starts  happening and you have to fight through it because like, if you just  plowed through it and then went back and read it, you might be like, oh, it's not really  as bad as I thought.  But when you're in the shit, you're just like, this is the worst thing ever.  Everyone's going to see that I'm a fucking idiot.  Like it just starts to be like, I'm a fraud.  I'm a fraud.  Well, my, uh, my, my idea, I know it's a good idea.  It's about, it's about a man with, uh, with anal fissures whose dream is to be a relief 
[02:51:30]  pitcher for the Padres.  And it starts off.  He's on his deathbed because that's what it's about.  That sounds like a great motion picture.  Yeah, it sure is.  Hey, are you related to Bill Paxton?  Oh, geez.  Hey, come on.  Because we've heard recently that there's a development on this.  Yes.  It's already here.  To every Bill Paxton line, what are you doing?  I guess we're like distantly related. 
[02:52:00]  I don't know.  I've never met him.  Yeah.  So my aunt's a genealogist.  That is so interesting.  We're related.  We're like 10th cousins, blah, blah, blah, whatever.  That's not even related.  I know it's not.  At that point.  I just like to say that I am.  Yeah.  Boy, that'll get you in that.  I'm like, he's my uncle.  One day he'll play his daughter in a movie and we'll all come together.  Yeah.  And maybe he'll break him.  Maybe.  Oh, that'd be awesome.  That's a daughter rape scene.  Wouldn't it be great to be raped by Bill Paxton?  Oh, God.  I think about it every day.  I'm going to put it in your ass.  Finger of God.  Zing.  That's what I thought Wall Street was missing. 
[02:52:30]  Because it was such a great scene between Martin and Charlie Sheen when he's in the hospital.  I thought he should rape him while he's living.  Really make that Gordon Gekko could come in and smoke.  That's really good.  Wait, were you on Action with Jay Moore?  Yeah, it was his daughter.  I thought I recognized you.  No way.  I was like 11.  No, I'm serious.  Your face hasn't changed much.  I'm sitting here going, how do I know her?  Jay Moore's a good friend of ours.  Oh, Action, right.  I was like 11.  It was awesome.  Your face is the same, though. 
[02:53:00]  Because I'm sitting there like, how do I know?  That's why we asked what you've been in.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, fucking Action.  I auditioned for that.  I liked Action.  Yeah, that was a good show.  It was pretty groundbreaking with the cursing that they beeped, right?  Yeah, that's what was so annoying about it, though.  You know, like the weeps.  Why beep it?  We know what he's saying.  Thanks to whoever on his feedback.  It's just a phone number, but right on.  What, that got one season?  That got one season, right?  One season, yeah.  You should have probably got more of her.  Yeah.  There's the one season kid.  That's me.  Oh, really?  Have you done a couple of series and got one season?  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  I mean, it happens.  They also call me Gravy Leg Paxton.  Sarah, you would have to look at her, but Sarah has a really peculiar sense of humor  in that, I'm going to throw you under the bus here, but when we would be shooting the  movie, we'd be like, we're ready to shoot this scene.  She's like, hold on.  I got to take a dump.  And then you've got to shoot the rest of the day with a hard-on.  I know.  It's true.  That's how it started.  And it just spiraled out of control from there.  So Sarah has a, you wouldn't, yeah.  Gravy Leg Paxton.  I had the Q&A.  She derailed it into the world of two in the pink, one in the stink, and everyone's like, 
[02:54:00]  how's it going down this road?  Oh, I can't talk about that.  But there's a part where I'm like, I can't move, and I'm in the movie, I'm strapped down,  I can't go anywhere, and they, you guys hired, oh, sorry, I'm forgetting this microphone  thing.  You guys hired the, like, real-life paramedic guys from Torrington, and so I, like, I had  a sheet over my face or whatever, and they were, like, whispering shit in my ear the whole  time, and they were like, hey, you want the shocker, like, and I was like, no, and I couldn't  move, and I was like, no, and they were like, one in the pink, two in the stink, and I was 
[02:54:30]  like, ah!  This one kind of was a great place, I don't think you have a lawsuit.  They were, like, farting in my face the whole time, and then, like, when they find me,  like, released me, I was like, Ty, they were farting in my face the whole time.  And you would think that I would, like, want to, like, come to her rescue, except for, like,  all of this has just come up for her doing that to everybody else the whole shoot.  Do you fart in their face?  Payback.  I mean.  Don't lie.  Whatever.  Not in their face.  Whatever.  That's rude, you know, but.  In the room. 
[02:55:00]  In the general area.  Just think the whole room up.  You drop me wherever you want.  She has scatological humor.  I like that.  Yeah, you wouldn't, and again, you wouldn't know.  So, looking at her, she looks very sweet and tame.  Once you get her going, you can't get her off the subject.  Yeah.  There was a lot of shit going down.  I mean, George Riddle, okay, who plays the older gentleman.  The older gentleman.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Saw his balls.  Wow, that must have been, like, melting Turkish taffy.  Saw his balls.  It was strange.  He also farted in my face. 
[02:55:30]  They were saggy.  Well, gravity has been taking its toll for a while on that gentleman.  He looked at my face by accident, and he was like, drop my phone.  And I was like, drop.  Oh, no.  That is gross.  But he's like, hey, he's a funny guy.  So, again, all of this, I think, is, well, it's all come up for Sarah doing this to everybody  else, but, yeah.  George is a really funny guy.  Yeah, he's funny.  Do you purposely not flush the bowl?  That's very antisocial behavior.  Dude, I don't really think she topshelves everybody.  That's the best. 
[02:56:00]  I just have water, you know.  We lived in the hotel.  We shot in the hotel.  We ate in the hotel.  We had to amuse ourselves somehow.  Yeah.  We went straight to that, because we're all children.  It was awesome.  It's like going to work, walk downstairs to the lobby.  One of my greatest moments ever was when I was doing some festival, and Bob Kelly was  there, and I took my girlfriend at the time in his room, and I had to shit.  And I took Bob's garbage bag out of his garbage can in the living room while he was in his  bathroom, and I shit into it.  And then I put it back in his garbage can, and I knew his room would stink.  He told the story recently.  Horrible.  Yeah, it was one of my finest moments as a person. 
[02:56:30]  Did he like it?  Do you know how sick he gets so fast?  Dude, shit am I going to say, what's fucking wrong with you?  Just puking and, yeah, wonderful.  Yeah, shit humor's great.  It's great.  Phenomenal.  It looks amazing.  One day we'll outgrow it, maybe.  No, I can never see that happening.  Hey, in the movie, that woman with the child there, what's her whole angle in the movie?  Is she just there for a reaction? 
[02:57:00]  Well, there's an element of, I guess, comic relief to it, but I think that her character,  the old man, all of the serial peripheral characters outside of Sarah, and to some degree  Pat, they're really kind of representations of what roads you could take to not sound incredibly  cheesy.  But the movie is about Sarah not quite, you know, she has this minimum wage job, and she's  never really thought about it.  And then this celebrity comes, and she's so excited to meet her, and then the celebrity's  an asshole.  And she's like, oh, what do you do?  And she's like, I work at the hotel.  And she's like, no, but in real life, what do you do?  And she's like, I work at the hotel. 
[02:57:30]  And so it kind of calls into question, like, if you just have one of these jobs, like, is  that not okay?  What should I be doing more?  And that's what kind of leads her to latch on to the ghost hunting, because it's something  to kind of be not apathetic about.  So, like, the mom who's, like, had a fight with her husband and is staying there with  her kids.  Like, these are all, like, different roads that people can take.  And the old man and how he's come back and things like that.  So, plus some comic relief or some little foreshadowing to what's going on.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I obviously don't want to give anything away.  Yeah, I have to say it.  The ghost story thing, when you're telling the ghost story, that thing is hilarious. 
[02:58:00]  It's a little kid.  Because you just don't, yeah, you don't realize.  But Sarah and I don't like children.  Dude, the kid.  Great.  And everyone always says, like, working as kids is really hard.  And the, uh.  Well, I just dug my own grave with this one.  Their feet start kicking.  Sorry, Todd.  So, I thought, I want to get, like, the really stage mom kid, who's, like, the adult in the  little bodies, who's just like, um, what am I doing here? 
[02:58:30]  But then you start to think, like, no, I got to get the real thing.  Because it's about, we got to be real.  And we got to get the real, pure thing.  So, I went and got, like, a real kid.  But real kids, when the boom comes in the shot, they go, hmm?  And they look at it.  Oh, God.  So, you've done a lot of takes.  Now, in fairness, this kid was actually pretty good.  But I, I'm not a kid person.  I'm an only child.  I'm a weirdo.  I was so mean to that kid.  I'm not good with kids.  And Sarah, I discovered, is awful with children.  I was like, how old are you?  Like, 14?  He's still shitting at pants?  Like, he's just, and you're just like.  And so, this poor kid, he's great, and he's awesome in the movie. 
[02:59:00]  But, like, it was such a weird, where I was like, I don't really know how to relate to  this situation, and be like, well, don't look at the boom.  But then I was like, well, maybe I should talk to him in, like, kid voice.  So, I kind of made the AD, who is a girl, I was like, do you like kids?  And she's like, I was like, you need to just handle this for me.  Yeah, deal with that.  You bribed him with pizza rolls.  We did bribed him with pizza rolls.  But it's really funny, because it comes across how, probably, I feel, because I wrote the movie,  and how Sarah feels in acting in the movie, is because the scene you're talking about  is she's telling the kind of, the ghost story of the movie, she's telling it to this little  kid to, like, scare him.  And she's just kind of being an asshole. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely, just to scare him.  Oh, well, I don't like that.  Gets mommy pissed off, yeah.  And then he's raped.  Yeah, yeah.  That was my favorite part.  I mean, I don't know if I'm alone here.  We thought about cutting out the child rape.  No.  You know what?  Highlight.  No, you should lead with it.  Open with it.  It should be in the trailer.  Yeah, like a blooper reel.  Yeah.  One thing I love, Ty has been listening to this dumbass show for a while, obviously.  It's true, probably for, like, I mean, 10 years or so. 
[03:00:00]  I lived in New York in, like, 99, and that's probably when you guys came on my radar.  And, yeah, I mean, I've heard you get fired a bunch of times.  Yeah.  You guys heard that.  And, as a matter of fact, you knew Melissa, my girlfriend, out in L.A., and they used to,  like, talk about the show.  I introduced her to the show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He introduced her to this show.  That's so weird.  You ruined her life.  Absolutely.  But then, at some point, I guess she got in touch with you, or somehow, you know, you 
[03:00:30]  got in touch with her, and she was like, yeah, I'm going out with Anthony.  You're like, get the fuck out of me.  And I started hearing it on the show.  And I started to be like, this is like worlds colliding.  It's so weird.  What the fuck is that?  Yeah.  And I was very proud.  As I was watching the movie, there is a line in the movie that he said he attributed to  me.  Yeah.  It's, um...  What was it?  Hang him?  Get me that cross in the gasoline?  Yeah.  Pat's, uh...  Iron my hood.  Pat's lines. 
[03:01:00]  He goes, uh...  I think he says, um...  I don't know a lot, but I do know a little bit about a lot of things.  I know a little bit about a lot of things.  And it's like, I...  When he said that, I was like, hey, I used to say that.  Oh.  And then he told me, he's like, oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember hearing you say that one.  But it is very fucking cool that, uh...  It's weird, because I listen to the show pretty consistently for a long time.  And, um...  That's like a lot of content that, like, comes in that nobody I know has any idea what the  fuck I'm talking about.  So I can't really be like, did you hear?  Because no one I know, like, in L.A. knows the show that well.  Yeah. 
[03:01:30]  And, um...  Oh, that's a bummer.  Well, it's only people I know.  We kind of want L.A. to know us.  Yeah.  So it's...  And I try to introduce people to it, and then that's the project.  They're like, no.  Because the first thing they'll hear, it'll be like, right.  And I'm like, it's not always like that.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, it is.  Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.  Usually they're not like this.  No, he leaves the rape alone for a second.  They go to retards.  I swear.  Well, he might be racist.  I'm not sure.  We're not really sure where he stands.  It's a persona. 
[03:02:00]  But he's probably racist.  No, he's racist.  Yeah.  But, you know, that amount of content comes in that when sort of you write something,  it's like, it's very strange.  I've never listened to something so consistently that long that's like, I mean, four hours a  day.  So like, I'll just be on my computer doing stuff, and it's just sort of in the background.  So it does kind of filter in.  It's weird.  Yeah.  I did a movie with the movie that I tried to take my name off, I did with Judah a while  back.  And I had known Judah before 30 Rock and all that.  And we had talked about the show back then and things like that.  And I think in that movie, there was several show references. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  I think so.  I don't really remember what they are, but the movie got so fucked up.  But there were a few show references.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That movie got fucking pulled up.  I'll do a great job in your space movie.  I'm telling you.  I'm ready.  Oh, my God.  You see the moon.  I see my next home.  Thank God.  He's always angry.  He is brilliant.  He's good.  He's always pounding his fist.  He is good.  He is good.  What a great choice.  Oh, my God.  Let people know you're really amped up.  Can you play Asian?  Because there's a lot of Asians in the movie.  Sure.  Show him your dick, Jimmy. 
[03:03:00]  Sold.  Amy Schumer.  Caroline.  Hey, Amy.  Oh, shit.  Well, this has been a lot of fun, man.  I mean, you know, we wanted to have you on for a while.  Yeah, we definitely appreciate you having us.  Oh, fuck.  We're a little movie, so, and you guys do have a big audience, despite not my friends in  L.A. listening to it.  I think there are plenty of people that do this to it.  I'm just fucking with your time.  It's very cool, man.  What's the big plug?  The movie, once again.  The Inquipers.  The Inquipers.  And what it's about, too, because we've been talking for so long.  And we've got a whole new audience.  They keep tuning in. 
[03:03:30]  The movie is a horror movie about these two nerds that work in a haunted hotel, and they  try to get proof that it's haunted before it goes out of business, and they get in over  their heads.  And it's currently available on VOD, so you can order it through the delightful Time Warner.  Yes.  Or Fios.  Or the wonderful Fios.  Or you can get it on iTunes or Amazon or anything like that.  But if you live in a major city, I would appreciate it if you went and saw it in the theater,  because we worked, it's been a year making this movie and meticulously crafting it to be seen  on a big screen with loud sound.  It's fun to watch with an audience.  It is.  Everybody's in it together.  That's what I was saying. 
[03:04:00]  I don't like going to the movies unless it's something where you look around and go, fuck,  people are having a good time and really laughing and jumping and shit like that.  And it was one of those movies where I was glad I saw it in the theater.  I'm absolutely going to watch it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's great.  Yeah.  Really cool.  If you do watch it at home, it's good, because a lot of people now have nice plasma TVs and  5.1 sound.  It's getting better.  Yeah.  But for my ulcers, just watch it a little loud and try to enjoy it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's a lot of experience.  But the other plug is February 3rd.  I'm going to watch it on my phone. 
[03:04:30]  Definitely.  Just like he made it.  I know this is the way he wants me to watch it.  Just be seen every time you glance at it.  I know what's going on.  That's Starbucks.  That's funny.  I almost died making it.  It's funny.  Yeah.  February 3rd, right?  Yeah.  And there's comedy in this, too, you should tell me.  Oh, man.  At least the first half is probably comedy.  It's dry comedy.  So it's not like...  Sarah and I are funny.  Yeah, I think they are very funny.  I think there's a scene where Sarah takes out the trash.  I've made six movies.  Oh, that's always funny.  Hilarious.  Yeah. 
[03:05:00]  Very funny.  And then, yeah, she gets raped.  Wait, rape.  So wait for it.  Wait for the rape.  Wait for it, yeah.  That's terrible.  That's so much rape.  Come for the horror.  Stay for the rape.  Very cool.  And, Sarah, what are you in next?  Anything?  You're just promoting this for right now?  For now, I'm just promoting this.  I have a movie coming out next year called Liars All.  It's another, like, independent movie.  So, yeah.  Cool.  Cool.  The indie chick.  Sarah's great.  She's going to blow up and then never talk to me again.  Oh, yeah.  I look forward to it.  That's what happens.  I already seem interested. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Who are you?  I know you.  That's what happens.  I actually drove us here.  That's all I did.  And Amy tonight through Sunday night is at Caroline's.  212-757-4100.  Headlining.  Great comic.  Headlining.  Come out.  Please come out to see Amy.  And also, just so people know, it's really important.  Here it comes.  I will be in Phoenix at the end of the month.  Oh.  Arizona?  No, not Phoenix.  Tempe.  He's doing court.  January 27, 28, Tempe Improv.  It's my first time out there. 
[03:06:00]  That's supposed to start like a real buzz.  Oh, yeah.  There's a real buzz around that show.  Tempe's an industry hotbed.  I heard Bill Paxton might come.  Oh, I hope so.  See, there you go.  Give him a call.  Let him know.  Arizona rocks.  Yeah, you don't like Arizona.  If I could bring one thing for Anthony to the show, and I'll probably regret it.  There's a movie that I think you should see.  Mississippi Burning?  No, not the right track.  This is a movie that stopped me in my tracks, which very few movies do.  It's a movie from the 70s.  It's called Goodbye, Uncle Tom.  And I can't recommend it to anyone, because it's, I mean... 
[03:06:30]  Is it brutal?  What it is, is it's this, like, fake documentary.  These Italian filmmakers that made these movies, Mondo Cane, which are these, like, kind of  exploitation movies from the 70s.  They made this documentary about slavery, so they, like, went to the South to document  it.  But that doesn't make any sense, because they made it in the 70s.  Yeah.  So there's this weird, like, what did they go back in time?  But they never really explained that.  Oh, shit.  It starts off with people talking about slavery, and it's like, you're like, all right, this  is all sort of well and good, and then it just starts to go off the rails.  Oh, shit.  And it goes into a territory that's, like, I mean, at this point in my life, I've seen 
[03:07:00]  so few movies that I went, like, oh, my God.  And it, like, stopped me in my track.  And they shot it, like, in Haiti.  It's clearly, like, slave labor.  So, but the production value is incredible, because it's like, well, look, there's 700  naked extras eating out of that slop trough.  Holy shit.  I've never seen anything like it, but it's something else.  I will check it out.  It's weird, but then it goes all the way up to weird, like, the black power movement  in the 70s.  It's a really unique movie, but it's, you get, we sweat watching it. 
[03:07:30]  It's just like, oh, God, does anyone know I'm watching this?  Because I don't really, I don't know if it's like.  Shut the shades, yeah, yeah.  It's not like it's necessarily, like, a racist movie by any means.  Like, that's how I kind of made it sound.  It's not.  It's just such an odd subject matter to take on, and it's such an odd, the scope is humongous.  Should I be watching this?  Yeah.  It's like the kind of thing where it's like, well, you know, we need to hang a bunch of people  upside down in the background.  Well, it's Haiti, so we'll just do that.  Oh, shit.  And so you can never say anything like it.  It's crazy.  Wow, yeah.  Not many laws down there governing that.  Holy shit. 
[03:08:00]  That sounds fun.  Sounds great.  Sounds like a good.  Yeah, I watched it at Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving?  It's a perfect time for moving like that.  I like that before.  For all the free labor that built this country.  Oh, God.  Well, come on.  So great.  No, but there's payback in the end.  There's a...  Oh, damn it.  I'll shut it off before that.  A blonde with a big black dick in her head.  They certainly do know how to show us as boss.  That trumps everything.  I can't do that.  I've never gotten that reaction.  I fucking don't like that. 
[03:08:30]  Is that it for us today?  I don't like that, Jim.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  I think we've done it.  I'm going to send you a link to one of the videos I've been watching lately.  You might like it.  Yeah.  Black guy's fucking her.  She's calling him Sir.  No, I don't really like the interracial sex videos.  That's all Sarah's jam.  I'm pretty.  Yeah, that's your thing.  What can I say?  That was never my thing, but it's really gotten kind of...  Your face.  I just don't want the husband's dumb face in it.  I just like when he's holding the video camera. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Being a good boy.  There's a lot of porno references in the movie.  And there's a great website called Salsa Snack.  Do you know Salsa Snack?  Oh, my God.  So I want to put on the DVD as a bonus feature.  Do you know how everyone did the two girls' one cup reactions?  Yeah.  She was Salsa Snack.  Great site.  And no one knew it, so we have a reaction video of everyone and Sarah losing her mind.  Being like, ah!  It's a Salsa Snack.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I was like, ah, prolapsed anus.  What's really turned up?  I don't want to see that.  Oh, prolapsed anus.  Jesus.  Sorry.  Oh, God.  That's a lot of wonderful.  That's a spoiler.  Oh, no.  Believe me, it's fine. 
[03:09:30]  You're right.  I thought there was, like, some butthole jav happening.  There is.  Butthole jav.  Now, that is more up my alley.  But it has a great sound.  That sounds interracial.  It's good, right?  Yeah.  Oh, we might have seen it on called something else.  Oh, I think it's Salsa Snack.  One jar, one guy.  It's not one jar, one guy.  Oh, no, no.  It's not.  You guys ruined my life with that one.  Yeah.  That was a bad one.  Tub Girl from there.  You weren't thinking about Tub Girl.  Oh, Tub Girl.  Tub Girl's easy.  Yeah.  Yeah, we laugh at Tub Girl.  That's an appetizer.  It's amazing.  It's just someone mixing a bunch of things together, coming out of several places. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, wow.  But to the tune of Journey.  Oh, really?  Which is what really makes it any way you want it.  Don't stop it.  Any way you want it.  Sure.  And that's the way you need it.  Right.  I can't stop watching the fake casting director one, where he's like, I'm not a real casting director.  You haven't seen these?  Those are the ones that have, like, the multiple angles.  Yeah.  It's always the same guy and a girl.  Yeah, and it sort of is under the guise of...  And it really seems like it's these girls' first time.  I buy it.  I mean, I don't really buy it.  He blurs his face, right?  Yeah, he always blurs his face. 
[03:10:30]  You go to the same sights.  But yeah, yeah.  We have the same taste.  Lars von Trier and Fucktown, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, I really like that one.  Kurt Metzger likes it, too.  Yeah.  Do you see the one with the two friends?  What's the guy...  Casting Couch.  That's the guy's thing.  Those are good.  I would try that.  Yeah, you got to check it out.  You try the Casting Couch?  I like the amateur stuff.  A lot of times, there are professionals who look like amateurs  because they have to get them their signed releases.  But it sounds pretty hot.  It's good.  It is.  I've been on that for a while.  It's too close to home for me. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Backstage.  What?  Cypax and bend over.  Yeah.  I just love it.  Because the girls always come in, and they're like,  my boyfriend's waiting in the car.  I can't.  And then they just cut to them bent over.  Like, taking it.  It's like they begged for it.  No more story.  Yeah.  I only really enjoy it if it seems like the girl's not into it.  You should watch every time I fuck.  And speaking of hot, boy, let me tell you, iTunes, check out, 
[03:11:30]  I got another Live from the Compound up there.  Oh, good.  We sit and watch Toddlers and Tiaras and comment on the horrific moms  and sluttily dressed children.  Oh, that sounds good.  I did that one last night with the new Toddlers and Tiaras.  That was on iTunes.  Also, Stunt Brain took care of us.  That video of Chris Kyle from yesterday.  Yeah.  The Navy SEAL sharpshooter who told the story of punching Jesse Ventura  and pretty much knocking him either out or definitely down.  You knocked him down.  You knocked him down.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:12:00]  Told the story on our show yesterday.  Not many people knew about this thing until yesterday.  Stunt Brain, our old producer, got it on the front page of The Blaze.  Was that recently that he punched Jesse or back in the day?  No, a few years ago.  A few years ago.  2006, I want to say.  The guy called up and said something.  Opie said, well, what about that story about you fighting Jesse Ventura?  And the guy goes, so I'm like, I didn't realize it was not a public story.  But he went with it.  He said, fuck it.  He told the story.  But you could see it on his face like, fuck it.  Not many people know this.  Did Jesse Ventura or something?  No.  No.  No, no.  I mean, it was just, you know, one Navy SEAL punching another one. 
[03:12:30]  But it's on the front page of The Blaze.  The Blaze.com has the whole story, the video and the whole story.  I punched someone last year at a holiday party.  And it's really weird when you punch someone as a grown-up.  It's a totally different feeling.  Why'd you hit him?  He poured beer on you.  Or her.  Okay.  Or her.  She burnt dinner.  He poured beer on you, so you socked him in the jaw?  Yeah, but it's weird, like, as an adult to do that.  It's a totally different feeling.  I would gather, yeah.  I haven't punched anyone in so long.  Did you knock him out?  I broke his nose. 
[03:13:00]  Nice.  Oh, nice.  It ended the party.  All right.  That's a real downer at a party.  Bravo.  Yeah.  But, I mean, it was weird.  Because it's, as you go, you're like, this sucks.  How did this just happen?  But it's.  Are you friends with him still?  I don't really know him.  Why'd he pour beer on you?  He's probably drunk.  I don't know.  Just some drunk guy.  Drinking beer.  And no lawsuit?  Because that's what you always have to worry about these days.  That's sock to their nose.  Everyone sues now.  It's one of those things.  It's just, like, shit happens.  Cool.  Yeah.  That's almost an assault.  You pour beer on somebody.  He's got the right to punch you.  Yeah.  Good for Ty. 
[03:13:30]  Ty West.  And Sarah Paxton.  Yes.  All right.  We should go, I guess.  Yeah.  Let's get the fuck out of here.  I got a tank hole.  Very good.  Thanks, Schumer.  Thanks, guys.  Yes.  Schumer.  It's my pleasure.  Sarah, Amy, Ty.  To the elevators, we go.  We'll race to see if we can get out of here.  We'll see you guys tomorrow, I guess, right?  Sarah and I are going to go take dumps on each other.  Oh, hot.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[03:14:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  The good-looking woman quotient on the show today was way above average.  Way above where it usually is.  I mean.  As opposed to zero.  Usually it's zero or it's in the negative numbers.  But, I mean, Sarah Paxton and Amy Schumer in studio at the same time. 
[03:14:30]  And then you had those two chicks, Laura and Kim, that called in today.  Now, they weren't like.  I'm not going to say that they had winning personalities, Laura and Kim.  They weren't the type of people that I'd love to sit down and have a conversation with.  But, we looked them up on Facebook and they had several pictures on there.  And, uh, much better looking than you would expect.  Much better looking than your typical female radio caller in her, especially to this show. 
[03:15:00]  Um, and it kind of gives me hope that there are some good-looking people out there to listen to the show.  Uh, it was good to have Ty West and Sarah Paxton in because it's always fun.  Like, Ty West was obviously, he's the director of the movie.  The movie's called The Innkeepers.  It's out in theaters on February 3rd, but it's on demand on cable right now.  So, go and, uh, and get it on demand.  And then once it's in theaters in your area, see it again because there's nothing like seeing a movie on the big screen.  But I don't think I need to tell, I need to tell you that. 
[03:15:30]  Do I?  Um, but yeah, it was good to have Ty West in because it was obvious that he was a massive fan of the show.  So, just, and it wasn't, you know, just sneaking in a little show references here and there that kind of caught you off guard because it doesn't happen all that often.  Like when he told Jimmy, I like what you do with your hands.  Yeah, and like, you know, we, we expect that maybe he's just complimenting Jimmy.  No, he's not complimenting Jimmy at all.  He's, he's, he's pointing out the awkwardness of it, but he's so familiar with the show that he knows. 
[03:16:00]  And, uh, it's just, it's very exciting to know that there's, uh, such a wide variety of people listening and that there's some real, some real Hollywood bigwigs and go-getters out there.  Um, Sarah Paxton was hilarious and that's, that's tough to say because Amy Schumer was in the room and, and she's one of the funniest, not women, people that we have on the show.  Amy Schumer is hilarious.  She'll be at Caroline's all weekend starting tonight.  So Caroline's.com is where you can go for that, uh, if you're in the New York City area. 
[03:16:30]  But Sarah Paxton, uh, usually when we have like good looking actresses in, they're just, I mean, a lot of them are very vapid people.  They're just here to kind of push whatever dumb movie they're in and then they kind of want to get out.  They'll do the little friendly flirty thing, whatever, to push their movie.  But Sarah Paxton was legitimately interested in having a conversation.  Very funny, uh, uh, very witty.  She even found the humor in rape, which, I mean, a lot of Hollywood actresses that come in here, we couldn't, we couldn't pull off. 
[03:17:00]  Opie, when he approached the rape topic, because Sarah Paxton was in Last House on the Left and she has a very, as she described it, long and, uh, somewhat, I don't even know what the word is.  Drawn out.  Drawn out, whatever it is.  It's a rape scene and it's hard to watch.  And Opie was a little timid when he approached the subject.  But once he did, she was like, yeah, I was in a rape scene.  It was long as hell.  It was hard.  It took forever. 
[03:17:30]  But, I mean, like, she was making rape jokes for the rest of the appearance.  She was hanging out and it's very cool.  The only thing, and I think this is different for me, because you have, uh, uh, a beautiful woman in here who's a talented actress and she's got a good sense of humor.  You think you're in the ideal situation, but as she was talking about it and Ty brought it up, the director, I can't, I don't handle it well when good-looking women talk about shitting.  Not even good-looking women, any women, I can't handle the idea that, uh, females defecate, which is probably an immature quality of mine, but just the idea that not only do they, uh, do they shit, but they're so comfortable with it that they make jokes about it. 
[03:18:00]  I don't like that.  I still, I've been with Jess for, like, six and a half years, my fiance.  I'm still unaware of that situation and I tell her to leave me out of it.  I don't want to know.  Now, Roland comes in here every day and he talks about shitting up a storm.  I'm fine with it, but for some reason, I can't take females talking about their shitting habits. 
[03:18:30]  Roland, what are you doing over there, buddy?  I see you.  You're, you're, you're fingering the caramels.  I love caramels.  I know you love caramels, but you're not supposed to have them.  Fuck yeah.  No, don't, uh, Roland, you're, you're not even 24 hours in.  What's wrong, buddy?  Dick in the ass or you're just hungry?  I love caramel.  That's all it is.  That's all it is.  How was, was last night, did you start your, your new, your new diet? 
[03:19:00]  Unfortunately, yes.  You did?  How's Troy as a life coach?  I didn't see him today.  What?  No, he didn't, he inspired me.  So because of this, it's all Troy's fault.  Don't eat the caramel, Roland.  You don't need to do that to yourself.  Don't unwrap that caramel, Roland.  I love caramel, I'm sorry.  No, you're, you're going to regret it.  Really?  Probably not.  You probably want it all.  But caramel came in this, uh.  It's from Dilla's Candy Store.  It's like the best.  Well, it's actually Sci-Fi sent it over. 
[03:19:30]  But this is Sea Salt Caramel, which is even better.  Okay.  I don't need every detail about the caramel.  Smell it.  Oh, man, it smells like it.  Whatever.  It's caramel.  That's not.  I don't care about it.  What difference does it make?  I had a piece.  It was good.  Whatever.  I've moved on.  I've moved past it.  You moron.  Well, Sci-Fi sent it in.  They're the morons.  Because for some reason, I guess they had a thing.  They're promoting some show.  And, uh, they sent Opie by himself a box full of candy. 
[03:20:00]  And they said, if you can hold back and not eat the candy out of this box, we'll send you something else.  And this is some little gimmick they were doing, some little promotion.  And they wanted him to promote their show and put on his Twitter, look, Sci-Fi Channel, I'm not eating the candy.  They must not listen to the show.  Well, why is that something else sucks?  But the candy, Dillon's is like the best candy.  So it's like, what else can they give you?  Well, I think a healthy alternative would be what they would give you. 
[03:20:30]  Fuck them.  Yeah, I understand that.  But the problem is.  Probably like a Troy Kwan friend.  That if they spent one hour listening to this show, they'd know that either Anthony or Jim was the much safer bet.  You don't send.  Are you smelling the caramel rolling?  Yeah.  You don't send.  I mean, if you don't want whatever it is that you're sending Opie to be smashed, don't send it to him.  He's got a history of it.  I mean, he's smashed so many things that at this point he doesn't even like to do it anymore because he says it's too predictable. 
[03:21:00]  But he does it because, I mean, I told him we all expect it.  We all want to see it.  It's like he said he does other things.  Like he doesn't want to smash stuff every time because he does other things.  But when you go to a concert, you want to hear a band play the hits.  It's fine if they got some new shit too, but you also got to sprinkle in the hits, and that's what Opie needs to understand, and I think he does.  Because he smashed that box of candy that SyFy sent to smithereens.  He pulled out a hammer that he always has with him just in case somebody gives him a gift, and he smashed it with all his might. 
[03:21:30]  But the candy bar survives.  Yeah, you're happy about that.  It's like the banana cream pie, red velvet, and termosu, Dylan's candy edition.  You shouldn't be eating any of that stuff.  These are fucking phenomenal.  I don't care.  I'm sure they taste good.  They're candy.  Of course they taste good.  No, but these are Dylan's.  That's the only reason.  They're magical.  It's the only reason for them to exist.  There's no other reason.  If candy didn't taste good.  No, they have the best candy, though.  It's all candy. 
[03:22:00]  No, it's not.  It's sugar.  It tastes good.  It's always going to taste good.  Well, no, all the time.  Well, I mean, really shitty candy.  I guess not.  But then why would anybody eat it?  They don't.  That's a good deal.  But I just can't understand.  Hopefully, I videoed it.  Opie's smashing the candy.  So hopefully that'll end up on Opie's Twitter.  And he can give SyFy exactly what they want, which is a documentation of what he did with  the candy they sent him.  Which is, I mean, he and then he threw it in the garbage as if it wasn't insulting enough. 
[03:22:30]  He opened the box up.  He smashed everything in the box before we had a chance to enjoy any of it with a hammer.  Then he shut the box.  He smashed the box with a hammer so there was a giant hole in the top.  And this was like a nice, well, it was like, it looked like a nice box.  It wasn't actually a nice box.  But it was supposed to be a nice presentation.  He smashed the box with a hammer so there was a giant hole in it.  Then he took the box and he threw it in the garbage can. 
[03:23:00]  Of all the insulting things to do to somebody's promotion.  But you know what?  They deserve it.  It's not like they just sent this box to us and said, why don't you promote it for us?  I mean, Roland, you deal with Hollywood people.  Is this typical behavior?  They do send a lot of promotional stuff to a person thinking.  You'll just talk about it.  If you send it to a Ryan Seacrest, they go, oh, thank you very much.  And Ryan is going to.  Well, Ryan Seacrest.  Will he spend time on his radio show saying, you know, I got this box of candy, but I'm going to hold off. 
[03:23:30]  I'm going to see what else they send me.  By the way, the show is da da da da.  No, he's not going to do it.  He's not going to.  Who would?  Like Scott and Todd would.  They would.  Scott and Todd would.  Smaller, you know.  Morning shows that target women.  Eric, you worked with Scott and Todd a little bit back in the day.  They're like a very highly rated big morning show in New York.  They would actually spend time with this?  Yeah.  They love doing promotions that go on forever. 
[03:24:00]  But the thing is, though, they're bought into, though.  This was a freebie trying to get under the radar kind of thing.  They wouldn't do this for free.  JV and Elvis probably would.  JV and Elvis might, but.  They don't exist.  They don't exist, so.  Oh, because of their problems.  What problems?  I don't know.  Well, then why would you say that?  I don't know.  You just start rumors for the sake of starting rumors.  No, you know who they are.  I need not even Google, so we're fine.  Okay.  JV's still working.  Good call.  Would any, Eric, you've been, you've seen a lot of radio shows in your day.  Would any radio show? 
[03:24:30]  This is more of a smaller market kind of thing.  We're not a smaller market.  No, I know that.  We're the O.B. Anthony show.  Ty West is a big fan, and he's a big Hollywood director.  But I guarantee you they probably sent one over to, like, to Howard, to Elvis Duran, probably  Ryan Seacrest, but none of those guys are going to do anything on the air.  We would, because we didn't like it.  No.  But other morning shows would take this and go, hey, let's run with this.  This gives us material.  Oh, my God.  I can't imagine being stuck at a morning show. 
[03:25:00]  I wonder, I bet Scorch might.  I wonder if Scorch would.  Oh, Scorch would be all over.  In the Syracuse days?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But he tried to be edgy.  He'd go, hey, you know, they sent us some candy and said, don't eat the candy and see  what happens.  We're going to send you something healthy.  But you know what I do here with the dog.  I'm going to eat the candy.  Yeah.  Ten after every hour, he'd be reminding everybody that he got this box.  It's ten after the hour, I'm eating another piece of chocolate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, Scorch.  The Mikey Piff show probably would.  What's the Mikey Piff show? 
[03:25:30]  I don't know.  Roland, again, just throwing stuff out.  What does he do it for, Eric?  Because he loves you.  He wants attention.  But why would he interrupt the Scorch thing to say the Mikey Piff show?  Because it sucked.  I was getting bored.  So you brought up Mikey Piff?  Yes.  Nobody knows who Scorch is.  Eric, listeners to this show know damn well.  Colin Quinn knows who Scorch is and he loves him.  Every day of his life.  Eric, you are in Roland's office.  Did he go, did he keep up with his new lifestyle? 
[03:26:00]  Is this why he's cranky today?  Did he keep up with his lifestyle yesterday?  From what I saw yesterday, he only had soup.  That was it.  And then what happened when you went home?  I grilled chicken and then I had asparagus and broccoli in my salad.  And that's it.  And I had balsamic vinegar and red-white vinegar and dressing.  What did you have for dessert?  One non-fat Jell-O pudding cup.  Okay.  I think that's okay.  You got to have a little something to treat yourself.  I just have that so I can curb the sweet.  Any exercise or no? 
[03:26:30]  No, no.  That didn't start yesterday.  I didn't.  I could say yes, but it didn't happen.  You shit all the time.  And you talk about this.  Yes.  I don't know if you heard me say this before you walked in the door.  Sarah Paxton was in here.  Gorgeous woman.  Talented woman.  Funny woman.  Who knew?  She's hilarious.  But she talks about shit and I can't handle that.  I don't like it when women discuss defecating.  How do you feel with females talking about shit patterns? 
[03:27:00]  I love it.  You're okay with it?  I'm fine.  It's like, oh, I guess there's something to talk about.  Yeah, I was like, so honey, how's the corn?  This way dinner won't be awkward for any of you.  Yeah, I think it's awesome.  Eric?  She's like the dream girl.  You're not into that at all.  Do you remember a while ago?  I got to find it.  But when Jill Nicolini used to come on the show.  Of course.  She talked once about tracking her corn.  That made me gag.  We were over on the K-Rock side and she was talking about that. 
[03:27:30]  Tracking her corn?  Yeah, it was horrible.  I don't like it when girls like, and they sometimes, like Jill Nicolini is one who will  start talking that way because she wants to be embraced by the room.  Yeah.  Even though that's not how she is naturally, she just wants to bring it up.  I don't like that.  But it's hard to disassociate that, no, those comments when you look at them.  Right.  That's all I'm thinking about now.  How often does your wife shit?  I don't know.  I don't pay attention to her. 
[03:28:00]  Good answer.  Good answer.  I don't want to know anything about it.  You're like in the bathroom, like, whoa, something died.  And when you think it might have happened or it might be happening, do you just put it  out of your mind and turn the TV up or something?  Oh, yeah.  I totally, I'll go in the other, like the living room or something like that and pretend  that I have no idea what's going on.  Or you knock on the door and go, do you need water?  Are you hydrating?  You can't.  You're the same way as me, Eric.  Then you can't look at them the same.  No.  And then it's like, then you're headed towards divorce.  Am I right? 
[03:28:30]  Well, I don't think it's a deal breaker.  If you came to terms with your wife's shitting patterns.  You just don't look in the eye, you know, for a few days.  But if you were like very aware of your wife's shitting patterns.  Or like if she came out and kept telling me that she was doing it.  Or like if she was on the bowl saying, uh, sex baby.  She calls you sex baby, right?  No, she doesn't call me at all.  Sex baby.  She says it's Prince Eagle.  Sex baby, I'm dropping a deuce in here.  Ugh.  And she did that like every time.  And then say.  I pretend I didn't hear it. 
[03:29:00]  Forty percent of the times that you went into the bathroom, she had left a log in the toilet  and you knew it was hers.  How quick would there be a divorce?  I'm not.  How, would that be, would that be grounds for separation?  Or at least a trial separation?  Would it be grounds?  No, no.  Because I'm telling you.  No, that's not grounds.  That isn't.  Because if this, if this occurred in my house, the engagement would be called off and the  ring would be taken back.  Wow.  And I'll tell you this.  That's extreme.  I gave her the ring. 
[03:29:30]  I gave Jess the ring on Thanksgiving, not Christmas.  So it's not a gift.  It's an engagement thing, which means I can take it back if the shitting thing becomes  an issue.  Now, would you take it back and hold on to it until, um, you know, uh, conditions  were better in your relationship and give it back to her?  Or would this be end all be all?  Here's what I would do.  I would take it back.  I would go to several jewelers and see how much they would pay me for it.  Then I would look at the insurance on it and whichever number was higher, that's what  I would take.  And it would be within the first week of taking it back. 
[03:30:00]  I would get as much money as I could for it.  And then, uh, and then go back down to Steven Singer.  He's got that policy, the no shitting policy.  I think he's got money back guarantees.  Yeah.  So I try to get my money back and then buy something really blinged out like a necklace  or a chain for me.  There's a box you can check off for that.  Maybe I'd make like a Hulk Hogan necklace or something.  By the way, speaking of Steven Singer, uh, you know what Steven Singer is known for,  right?  Steven Singer Jewelers.  Uh, it's known for the most dominant, being the most dominant diamond store in America.  If you're looking for any shape, any size, loose certified diamonds, everyone knows you 
[03:30:30]  just go to Steven Singer and that's it.  Okay.  I'm going to read this as it's written because somebody didn't really think it says right  up on the top of this copy, who the host of the show is our own Sam popped the question  with a Steven Singer diamond engagement ring and they couldn't be happier.  Congrats.  First of all, you Sam, that would be me.  Oh, I popped the question with a Steven Singer diamond engagement ring and I will let you 
[03:31:00]  know whether or not I couldn't be happier.  Now, could I be happier?  I mean, I don't think that I am very happy.  Could I be happier?  Of course not.  Steven Singer took care of me.  I could be happier with the fact that nobody bothered to realize that it says Sam after  show and then Sam in the copy as if it's a third person, but whatever.  Steven Singer jewelers is risk-free shopping and it is.  I've been there.  I got my engagement ring from there.  And like I said, honestly, Jess became a very happy person. 
[03:31:30]  I couldn't afford the ring that I gave Jess, or at least I thought I couldn't until I went  to Steven Singer.  Steven Singer, the absolute best guarantee and warranty in the business, 90 days, no questions  asked, full money back guarantee.  If you give her that diamond and then she starts talking about shit 24 hours a day, Steven Singer  will give you your money back.  You can't find that anywhere.

On California, they had a funny shit scene this season.  Did they?  Yeah.  The season coming up?  Yeah, it's awesome.  Was it a female or a male?  I want to say it's hilarious.  Well, with saying that, David Duchovny's on the show tomorrow.  David Duchovny's coming in tomorrow?  Yeah.  I'm going to let him know the truth is out there. 
[03:33:00]  I think he knows at this point.  He does.  He's aware.  Yeah, he might.  Thank you, Eric.  This is crazy.  Jason, all the way from Australia, is calling in, Roland.  I can't not pick this one up.  Jason, in Australia, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Wow.  Yeah, morning.  I wanted to make an observation about my own radio show.  You have your own show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It's on Faction.  Never mind that.  I don't know.  But when I get candies, you better believe that I promote them on the air. 
[03:33:30]  You do.  It's interesting.  You mentioned that Roland was fingering the candies because I'm way ahead of him.  Oh, no.  Well, thank you.  Thank you, Jason, in Australia.  Right up there anal.  Right up there anal.  Thank you so much.  It's been a while since I heard from Jason in Australia.  I'm starting to think that he's not who he says he is now.  What do you think of that, Roland?  I understand about fingering candy.  Fingering candy.  I meant just holding it with your fingers.  Oh. 
[03:34:00]  Steve Sterniolo.  Come in here.  The pit bull.  Steve Sterniolo.  I got to get your opinion real quick.  Yeah.  I'm not going to keep you.  I actually have a question for you, too.  What is it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We might have an interview with the Mob Wives at 11.  You in?  Let's do it.  Let's interview the Mob Wives.  Spencer's been on this show.  Yeah, go ahead.  Where are you at with women shitting?  It doesn't really bother.  As long as I don't hear it or smell it, it doesn't bother me.  They can be like, oh, I'm going to take a show.  Okay.  It's cool.  I can't talk to you.  You got to go.  I'll talk to you at 11.  I'll text you about 11.  Yeah, text me at 11 because that's weird.  I can't.  All right. 
[03:34:30]  Why did you have to throw?  I'm more creeped out by Roland shitting.  You are.  You should be.  Yeah, look at him.  It's much more of a disaster scene.  Roland seals down old bathrooms.  Yeah.  Well, I know that and I'm okay with that.  I'm okay with Roland doing it.  The other thing that was brought up today, first of all, I love Opie's concept.  In the first hour, oh, Eric is showing me.  Let me see that.  Can you have Sal bring that in here or something?  Yeah, we have to give away.  And what about the book?  Am I giving away the book too?  We could do both if you want. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, give me both of those things.  Okay.  And I'll tell you what.  I wish I would have given something to Jason in Australia.  Why don't you give this away?  The candy bars?  I'm not going to give the candy bars away.  I'll eat them later.  Opie's concept of voting or endorsing a candidate but then not committing one way or the other  whether or not he's even going to vote at all.  It's hilarious.  I don't vote.  You don't vote?  I wasn't going to vote the last one, but then the pizza place had no lines that went for the pizza.  I see. 
[03:35:30]  Whoa.  Whoa.  Sal, that banner, you almost knocked it over.  I saw my life flash before my eyes.  Don't shrug your shoulders.  I don't care about the bat.  Oh, okay.  Thank you so much.  Oh, man.  This is a copy of Shark Night on Blu-ray and digital copy.  It just came out.  It did.  It just came out.  And I haven't seen it, so I actually just won a contest on my own show.  You can't do that.  It's illegal.  It's not illegal because it's not sponsored.  It's not a real contest.  You can't give away something and then take it out.  All right.  You're right.  I can't give it away, so I won't.  Do I give away the cover? 
[03:36:00]  Look, all they want is the mention.  Shark Night on Blu-ray.  They didn't want any mention.  All right.  Well, they're not getting it because I'm bringing it home.  And Eric's mad because he didn't think of it.  No, I didn't want it.  I was giving it away to the listeners.  You're not giving anything away here.  Demand Sam give that away.  I'm not giving it away.  I'm going to watch it.  This is what I have, though.  I didn't give it away yesterday, so I give it away today.  We're talking about politics and Opie officially endorsing Ron Paul but not committing to actually voting for him.  He endorses him and he encourages everybody else to vote for him but will not draw a line in the sand and say that he will. 
[03:36:30]  Why don't you call up now for a copy of American Sniper, the book written by Navy SEAL Chris Kyle.  Call up 866-WOW-1-WOW, and somebody wins.  We have one copy.  It is signed, and it's the guy who was on yesterday.  Actually, the video of that guy made the Blaze.com.  It's on the front page.  It's him telling the story of punching Jesse Ventura in his face, which I guess apparently one of his friends called up, he said, or something, because that story was nowhere. 
[03:37:00]  Like, that wasn't in any articles.  He had never done anything publicizing that story, and it's true.  So that video is on the Blaze.com.  It's on YouTube.  Just search it out.  But Chris Kyle.  Line 9?  Yeah, why not?  You want to call?  All right.  Roll and call it.  Line 9, what's your name?  Hey, my name is Jeff.  Jeff?  Where are you from, Jeff?  I'm from Baltimore.  Do you like Chris Kyle on the show yesterday? 
[03:37:30]  He was great, man.  And him punching off Jesse Ventura was fucking great.  Did you see the video?  No, I haven't seen the video, no.  He has this, like, Chris Kyle is the typical guest that makes you feel like you're not a man at all, which I'm not, so maybe it's a good thing to have him on.  But, like, even the way he was describing the story, it was a manly way to describe a manly action.  He wasn't bragging about it.  He didn't even want to talk about it.  He was kind of bashful.  Like, where'd you punch him?  And he was like, yeah, in the face. 
[03:38:00]  It was like...  It's like, he didn't even think about it.  It's like, you know what, this guy's a douchebag.  Now I'm about to punch you in the face, and without even saying it, he just fucking rocked him.  Yeah, he has, like, a protocol.  It's like, you bring up, you say, look, could you not say that?  Because we're trying to, you know, we're having a wake right now.  And then Jesse does it again.  He gives it one more time.  He's like, look, we can have a difference of opinion, but could you respect this?  Jesse, again, brings up that soldiers are dying for whatever, for no reason, whatever Jesse's opinion is. 
[03:38:30]  So he goes, all right, well, this is my last option then.  And he punches Jesse Ventura in the face and knocks him on the ground, which, I mean...  Did he say what Jesse said after?  Did he just, like, clutch the side of his face and walk away?  Well, he said after, because I guess Jesse Ventura was saying that we were fighting for no reason.  And Chris, Chris Kyle said, look, you know, he's done...  By the way, Chris Kyle, I think he did nine tours of Iraq.  But he said, it's not up to me to convince you that this is a good war. 
[03:39:00]  I signed up to serve my country and this is where they sent me and that's it.  Just respect that and move along.  Jesse Ventura then said, we're fighting for nothing.  And something to the effect of, some of you deserve to die or, you know, some of you deserve to be lost.  Yeah, you deserve to lose a few, was the way Chris Kyle said it.  And so Chris Kyle punched him in the face, knocked him on the ground.  And then what you were saying was he then ran out because he said there were cops right outside the door. 
[03:39:30]  So he was like, I'm getting the fuck out of here.  Oh, so great.  But I'm sure that Jesse was humiliated.  Well, you, my friend, have just won this book.  Thank you very much, sir.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold and they're going to take your information.  We have one more, but it's not signed.  Oh, who wants the door prize then?  Line nine was the line, whoever's in there.  Sal, I guess.  Who won the signed book?  One more copy of the book.  This one is not signed.  It's not signed, but the book is still good.  And it's like, you could buy the book or you could win the book. 
[03:40:00]  Let's see who is on line.  Oh, line one.  Line four, you almost made it.  Line one.  Hello.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  What's your name?  Not from Jersey.  Not?  Yeah, I'm a combat veteran and a writer.  I was hoping maybe, uh, give me something for free from a fellow veteran.  Did you hear him yesterday on the show?  Yeah, I've heard him before.  He's pretty, he's pretty cool.  He's great, man.  Yeah, well, you won, obviously.  So congratulations.  You get the book.  It's not the signed copy because we gave that one away, but this one, at least you'll 
[03:40:30]  be able to read it and maybe get some inspiration for your writing.  Awesome, man.  I appreciate it, Sambo.  All right, man.  I'm going to put you on.  What about Shark Night?  No, somebody already won Shark Night.  Who won Shark Night?  I did.  Me, Sam Roberts.  Why don't you just give away the cover of that sign?  The paper thing that's signed?  Yeah, I keep the movie.  So you give away something.  But I don't have to give it away.  It's mine, though.  You watched those?  No, it's mine.  I got it, though.  You watched those movies?  Yeah.  It says, it says from the director of The Final Destination. 
[03:41:00]  And The Final Destination, to me, is one of the greatest series of films ever made.  You told me to watch, there's five of them, right?  They're good.  Yeah, they're awesome.  You told me to watch them.  I haven't watched them.  I know I like horror movies, but I watch those.  It's the same movie every time, but it's awesome every single time.  Different cast.  Yeah, it's a different cast.  It's the same premise.  Somebody dies on a roller coaster.  Somebody dies from an elevator.  It's either a girl or a guy who survives.  It's the same shit every time, but it's always awesome.  But they sent that to me, the Blu-ray, so I'll give it back.  No. 
[03:41:30]  Stop throwing caramel at me.  Well, anyway, we got something else given to us today.  Is that a giveaway?  No.  Well, it is, but to somebody here in the studio.  For who?  This is a gift for Roland.  What did Roland get a gift for?  From our friends at the Martha Stewart channel.  What did he give me anything?  It's my show.  They said you would know the name of this bakery.  They said it's really good.  Oh, it's a baked good.  Roland's supposed to be dieting, Eric.  I did know this one.  He said it's one of the best bakeries in the entire city.  It is.  Oh, my God.  This is going to be tough.  They're jelly donuts. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, my God.  Gourmet jelly donuts, which I don't know how that makes them different, but Eric just gave  you a box of homemade, organic, whatever they are, gourmet jelly donuts.  When I had a really shitty day, I went in my pajamas to this place.  You did?  Yeah.  Let me see what they look like.  I'm not going to do anything to them.  They're huge.  Let me see.  I'm going to smell them.  Oh, my God.  And they're different jellies, too.  Is that right, Roland?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah, it looks like one.  Oh, and they smell so good.  Is this cinnamon?  Yeah. 
[03:42:30]  Oh, Roland.  And you're a weak man, Roland.  I don't know how strong you are.  Boom to me, sugar tits.  I mean.  Yeah, well, if my life coach doesn't show up in the next few seconds.  Sal, where's Troy?  Get Troy.  Tell him there's a life coach emergency.  Because Troy, to me, has been a very shitty life coach.  He hasn't done anything.  Yesterday on the, Roland, you're getting way too close.  You didn't eat the caramel.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  What's the brown stuff there?  This is raspberry.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, the strawberry.  Oh, no way.  Troy, you're supposed to be life coaching. 
[03:43:00]  I'm not his life coach.  Why?  Just look at him.  He's sitting there.  Pastries and.  But you didn't, you know, you didn't try, though.  He didn't try, either.  He's got to try.  I'm not, dude, I don't give a fuck.  I really don't care.  But, see, that's, Roland, you need a different life coach.  Troy's a shitty life coach.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Find a different life coach.  You know what?  I was watching the Anderson Cooper daytime show yesterday.  And there was a life coach on there.  And I was watching it.  And the life coach was going like, oh, you know, you can't, don't worry about failing  because you can't gain experience unless you do. 
[03:43:30]  And all this stuff that was so inspiring and stuff.  And then I was thinking about Troy, who's just sitting there going, dude, you got to  exercise.  And then Roland says, I don't want to.  And then Troy goes, ah, fuck this shit then.  Because this isn't the first time, Sam.  We've gone through this.  I haven't touched any of this yet.  You're right.  Roland went through a big thing where he was like, I'm juicing.  It's on.  He went and bought the juicer.  He bought the fruit.  He came in with his juice.  And he's like, ugh.  And then he had like a chicken cordon bleu that day.  And this has happened multiple times. 
[03:44:00]  And we, and we, a chicken cordon bleu.  That is delicious.  I would imagine.  This isn't anything new.  Roland wants to get there, but he needs someone to push him.  I'm not pushing him.  It's not my responsibility, dude.  It's his health, man.  He's going to want to do it on his own.  It's like an alcoholic and going, you have to push an alcoholic to stop drinking.  Yeah, that's what meetings are for.  They have to want to do it themselves.  Yeah, but he wants to do it, but he needs help.  They have to become so disgusted with themselves that they reach out for help. 
[03:44:30]  He's not asking for help.  He is in his way.  He's afraid to actually ask.  No, he's not.  I haven't touched the candies, though.  Yeah, he hasn't touched the caramel.  He ate properly yesterday, even though you were just the, you were like, you know, an  absentee parent.  Like, you were the shittiest life coach I've ever seen.  That's fine.  Like, you were as shitty at being a life coach as if Roland was a nutritionist.  I don't want to be a life coach.  I have no desire to be a life coach.  Roland is on his own.  If Roland comes to me, he goes, dude, I really need help.  Please help.  I'm in.  Then I'll help him.  But I'm not forcing his hand. 
[03:45:00]  I don't give a shit.  It's his life.  He can do whatever he wants with it.  Roland, how do you rate Troy's life?  Coach, we tried it.  I thought we were going to do a week and a half, but this has been about 24 hours.  Not good, right?  I told him to exercise 20 minutes yesterday.  Did you exercise?  No, but I ate properly.  It's a step in the right direction.  It's a step in the right direction.  But dude, I know thanks to you.  But all you have to do is get on a treadmill and walk.  That's all you have to do.  You don't have to run.  Just start walking.  You have to start building your strength up.  I got home late last night.  Exactly.  It's just going to be excuse and excuse and excuse.  Yeah, I was booking the show, motherfucker. 
[03:45:30]  Well, that's right.  Roland, he was booking the show, motherfucker.  Does the show give a shit about your health?  Not my paycheck does.  No.  The show is destroying his health, as a matter of fact.  Yeah, exactly.  Now, Roland, do you respond to this kind of, I mean, very tough love from Troy?  Or are you not?  I feel like you're going to slip under this because Troy is not checking up on you.  He's not giving a fuck.  I know.  And that's going to make it tough for you to give a fuck.  Or is it not?  When I have my pizza, I'm going to go, this is for Troy Kwan. 
[03:46:00]  Maybe we need to find you a different life coach then.  This is a great idea.  Eric, do you think you could be Roland's life coach?  Not at all.  You don't think so?  No, I got my own life to sort of deal with.  Roland, who around here do you think could be your life coach?  Mars.  You think Mars could be your life coach?  Well, like a life pain, no.  Life pain is not a good joke.  I don't know.  Do you think Mars can do it?  What about Sal?  Sal, you're here five days a week. 
[03:46:30]  Get in here, Sal.  I'll corrupt him.  Sal, I need to talk to you.  What about Rob Cross?  This is his.  I don't know.  Rob Cross has a lot on his plate dealing with the whole show.  I don't think he can handle being your life coach, too.  Wow.  Let's get Sal in here.  This could be Sal's breakout moment as an intern.  Troy's failed.  Because I didn't volunteer.  You volunteered me.  But you failed.  I had oatmeal for breakfast.  I had oatmeal for breakfast.  I haven't had that shit in years.  Sal.  Yes.  You're a young man. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah.  You're in great shape.  No, but okay.  No, I've noticed you're in great shape.  You have an excellent work ethic.  Okay.  You've outshined other interns.  All righty.  One in specific, but definitely other interns.  You're here five days a week, right?  Right.  Tell me this, Sal.  Do you have what it takes to be Roland's life coach?  Let's get it going.  Sal, you be Roland's life coach.  You have a good attitude.  You come in here smiling.  Yeah.  You're still happy to be here, even though you've been here since September, which is a lot less time than any of us lasted. 
[03:47:30]  Do I have what it takes?  Can you be Roland's life coach?  I could give it a try, but it might be difficult.  It's very hard to change someone.  I know it's difficult, but that's the task at hand.  I'll try it.  All right.  All right.  We're going to do it.  I mean, here's my suggestions.  Yeah.  And I suggested this yesterday, and Troy didn't follow up on it, so Roland didn't do it.  Yeah.  I think Roland needs to have a food diary.  A food?  Yeah, that's pretty good.  That's good, right?  Yeah. 
[03:48:00]  And written, not off the top of your head.  Written every time you eat.  You write that down.  I think you need to write a fitness plan for mind, body, and soul, because that's what a life coach is, mind, body, soul.  And you need to figure out what your strategies are for Roland.  Fifteen minutes of meditation a day.  I don't know.  I have no idea what to do.  You're the life coach.  I'm not.  Okay.  And what's the goal?  What are we trying to do?  We're trying to put Roland in a healthier place, and that's make him physically more healthy, lose the weight, mentally more healthy, 
[03:48:30]  a little easier to cope with stress.  And I think once those two things kind of happen, he'll be happier, and we can guide him professionally if he's lacking in that area.  I don't know if he is or not.  I'll give it a try.  I think you could do it.  Troy failed.  I don't know if you heard that.  But Troy only had one day, though.  I mean, it's not like...  It didn't work out.  Yeah.  One day.  It didn't work out, though, did it?  I mean, I don't care.  Right.  See what I mean, Sal?  Okay.  That's the attitude that I don't want instilled in Roland.  I'm afraid... 
[03:49:00]  This has happened multiple times, though, because when I have really tried to...  Off air, not a bit, like off air, try to connect with him...  Troy, this is genuine.  This is not a bit.  Right.  Exactly.  When I've tried to connect with him off the air, it's like, yo, dude, you really should probably try to get your shit together.  And he seems so sincere, and I know, I know, I want to lose weight for when I go home.  I want to do this.  I want to do that.  And then he just...  Then I look in there, and he's eating chicken cordon bleu.  Was it good, Roland?  That was fucking delicious.  Toasties.  Chicken cordon bleu, right?  I love you, Toasties. 
[03:49:30]  E-Rock, you work with Roland on a regular basis.  You work with Sal on a regular basis.  Obviously, Troy's tapped out.  Three strikes, and Troy's out of here.  He can't do it again.  Can Sal make the change in Roland's life, initiate that change, be the motivator that Roland needs?  Can Sal, intern Sal, be Roland's life coach?  I think Sal has the drive to get it done.  Okay.  All right.  I like that.  Roland, are you in?  I haven't touched the donuts yet.  And Sal, this means you're going to have to talk to him about the drinking, too. 
[03:50:00]  And we are quickly approaching a weekend.  And he's told me he has a lot of drinking planned.  And for Roland?  Because Greg was here today, so GC.  Today's Thursday?  Yeah.  So when I say quickly approaching a weekend, I mean...  Less than 24 hours.  No, I mean less than 24 minutes.  And the weekend's here for Roland.  Yeah, because of comics, and then we're all meeting at 6 o'clock at a bar.  Are you going to do this, Sal?  Yeah.  I'll give it a whirl, but, you know, we'll try.  I can't wait to see the results. 
[03:50:30]  And we're going to go...  We'll still keep it until next Friday.  Because, Roland, you started yesterday.  You didn't...  You say you didn't slip.  I didn't.  Okay.  I believe you.  So then how did I fail if you didn't slip?  Because he didn't exercise.  It's because I got home at 6.37 by the time I...  I just fell asleep.  And you're not...  You're not motivating him.  He was doing this by himself.  But I don't trust that he'll get to the next step with you.  Yeah, but he ate what I told him to eat.  But he didn't exercise when I told him to exercise.  Roland, do you think you'll get to the next step with Troy or Sal? 
[03:51:00]  I'm thinking Sal is the guy to do this.  I don't know.  I think we're going to try with Sal.  Because tonight, I can't exercise tonight because I'm seeing Van Halen.  Well, you can always make time to exercise.  We'll put him in the pit.  He'll start, you know...  Yeah, that's physical activity.  You do a lot of bullshitting around here.  You could make some time to exercise.  Maybe.  Maybe.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thank you, Sal.  And Troy, it was a good effort.  Yeah.  And you've tried multiple times, like you said. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  He had convinced me...  And see, Roland's an excellent bullshitter because he had convinced me he is going to  make a real attempt.  He's going to start juicing.  He saw the documentary, Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead.  It inspired him.  He was like, oh, I need to do this.  And it really is an inspirational documentary, but he's not...  He lasted...  Waiting for the sequel.  Yeah.  That's when you realize there's a difference between a life coach and a magician.  Yeah.  You know?  But it also, again, you have to want to do it. 
[03:52:00]  Do you want to do this, Roland?  I want the Orwashers.  Roland, what do you want more?  You want the happiness and the ladies, or you want those jelly donuts sitting in front  of you?  Jelly donuts is cheaper and less pain.  No, it'll be more pain in the end.  It'll shorten your life drastically.  I think Roland probably thinks that he's in way over his head.  Do you think you're weighing over your head with your weight?  Oh, kind of like when you're in credit card debt and you're just like, why can't...  Well, fuck it.  Yeah.  It's a million dollars in debt. 
[03:52:30]  I have a friend, Eric knows him, this dude was about 500 pounds.  Oh, yes.  And he was massive.  He was huge.  He was...  I was in a band with him and we would tour with him and he would just smell on the road  so bad.  Yeah.  And we would stop at McDonald's and he would have two Big Macs, he would have a large  milkshake, three French fries.  Sounds like Travis's lunch.  He also, too, like if he stopped at the supermarket, he got all the food that he knew nobody else  would take from him.  So he had like just pounds of like liverwurst and mustard and all this horrible shit. 
[03:53:00]  Gross shit.  But he would eat it and it would stink everything up.  And he was just, he was massive, 500 pounds.  And he, he, we would go to McDonald's and he would go, it's just like spitting in the  ocean at this point.  Because he was so fat.  He's like, what's fucking two Big Macs?  He didn't even see the purpose in starting anything because it would take too long.  Right.  And he lost half of his body weight.  A little more than that.  More than that now.  Yeah.  Did he have to go in for the surgery?  Uh, he hasn't gone in for the surgery.  He actually, no, he had other surgery, but not for, for the weight loss.  Well, no, you don't know.  That's what I'm talking about.  I don't mean. 
[03:53:30]  Well, no, the surgery to get your skin removed.  That's what I meant.  When you, when you weigh that much and lose all that weight, you can't lose all that  excess skin on your own.  Of course not.  So he had the surgery to remove the skin that from the weight he already lost.  But he lost the weight through diet and exercise.  Diet and exercise.  That's it.  Lifestyle changes, Roland.  Were you paying attention or were you thinking about the donuts?  Nothing about booking.  What was that?  Roland, I think you have it and you do it.  I think Sal, uh, you're going to need Sal.  Well, I need the guys to say more yes and then I'll do it for guests. 
[03:54:00]  No, you gotta, you gotta be an independent entity here.  Okay?  You can't let your, your destiny be controlled by other people.  You know what I mean?  You have to be able to deal with the stress of booking because otherwise other people are  controlling your life, Roland.  That's no way to live.  Are you a man or a machine?  Are you a man or a machine?  He's a cotton candy machine.  Are you a cotton candy machine, Roland?  I love that machine.  You do.  You do.  Roland, I think you should totally do this.  Can we turn on you?  The life coach thing? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I really want that jelly donut if he's not going to eat it.  He's not going to eat it.  Travis, you can have him.  He can have him.  Wait, wait, wait.  The delicious.  Check with Sal.  Sal.  Sal.  How many of the three jelly donuts can Roland eat?  How many of the jelly donuts can Roland eat?  Right now?  Yeah.  None.  None.  No, let's see.  But they're up for grabs.  Can Travis have one?  I should have this one?  Yeah, that's really, really good.  I'm not Travis's coach, so yeah.  Real quick.  I don't need a coach.  I'm fine.  Bobby the Champ, Travis's favorite intern of all time.  Oh, yeah!  Bobby the Champ's on the phone.  What's up, Bobby?  What's going on, guys? 
[03:55:00]  Does Roland know there's a gym in the basement?  And I go to it, so if he wants to come to the gym in the basement.  That's right, yeah.  There is a gym in the basement.  You can work out with Bobby the Champ, and he is the champ!  And gay.  And gay.  I didn't know that.  So, Roland, you want to go to the gym with me today?  Maybe.  Well, I don't have a New York Sports Club gym.  No, Roland has to take a nap.  He's going to Van Halen.  Well, can you bring a guest in?  Yeah, of course.  Would you go as a guest to Bobby?  Roland just scowled, like, ah, foiled again! 
[03:55:30]  Can you go?  I don't have my gym clothes.  He doesn't want to do it.  Just don't do it.  Just be fat.  See, that's not what you, you don't want Troy saying that.  But you know that.  I mean, you know what it takes to do it.  How often are you there?  Do you want any pictures or autographs ever?  I'm trying to help you out.  I'm trying to help you out, too.  How often are you there, Bobby?  I'm going, I go Monday through Thursday and then Saturday, but I don't go to this one  on Saturday, but I'll go on Friday.  I'll go tomorrow if he brings his gym clothes.  Tomorrow, Roland.  Bring your gym clothes in.  You'll meet.  But what time? 
[03:56:00]  5.30, 6 o'clock.  Can you go that late, Roland?  I'll be home.  You might not be here.  Can you go in your lunch hour, Bobby?  Yeah, I'll go in my lunch hour.  Okay.  All right, and what time is that?  Whatever.  Whenever I'll, you know, 12, 1 o'clock.  1 o'clock, Roland.  We'll discuss later.  You bring your gym clothes tomorrow, and at 1 p.m., you work out tomorrow with Bobby  the Champ at New York Sports Club down in the basement.  We'll work out.  Bobby, I'm going to try to make him do it.  Okay.  All right, thanks a lot, man.  1 o'clock. 
[03:56:30]  I'll be downstairs.  1 p.m.  All right.  All right, thanks, man.  Don't wake up.  Roland, you've got to exercise sometime.  It's as easy as walking on a treadmill.  What are you so scared of a gym for?  I'm not scared of a gym.  Like, you don't even have to sweat this time.  What?  You just walk like this.  Roland, go like this.  No, you're just moving your head in the motion of somebody walking.  You're still sitting.  At least dance a little at Van Halen tonight.  Maybe walk to Cafe Wa. 
[03:57:00]  What if you walk there?  Yeah, so I can freeze.  Brilliant.  Okay, so you're not going to walk there either?  No, I think it's that way.  We're kind of done to those.  Deliciousness.  What are they?  What kind?  Raspberry.  You want one, Troy?  Yeah.  I think Troy and I should bond over a donut.  Why don't you each have one?  I'm definitely having one.  I think it's like raspberry, blackberries, strawberry.  And what are these candies?  Can I have these?  Yeah, take them, dude.  All right, cool.  I think it's raspberries, blackberries, strawberry.  Well, listen.  That's the strawberry.  It's delicious.  That's the one that I'm going to have.  We'll be chronicling.  We have to go, right, Eric?  He's looking at his phone. 
[03:57:30]  We have to go, right?  He's got two minutes till.  We do?  Yeah.  How?  Oh, did you blow up promos?  Oh, okay.  Roland, like all you have to do is go down and do a little walking on the treadmill.  You put on some good music.  You watch TV.  You don't have to put in 20 minutes.  You're done.  Throw the headphones into the treadmill.  They usually have the TV right there on it.  I do that in my apartment when I get back.  Is there like a further subway stop that you can take at home?  No.  Oh.  Well, I do.  I walk.  Because that's not a bad idea, right? 
[03:58:00]  No.  I mean, just walk a little further to the subway.  No, I do walk because the apartment's by the river and the subway is...  How many blocks?  It's probably a good four avenues and a few blocks up.  Four avenues, I mean...  You could have to walk around.  It needs to be 20 minutes.  20 minutes.  20 minutes of cardio.  A start.  Start.  A good start.  All right.  Well, listen, Roland, we're going to be on top of this.  We're not going to forget about this one.  You guys will need something.  Trust me.  Roland, we're not punishing you. 
[03:58:30]  We have your best interest at heart.  That's why I don't push Roland, because I like...  Because he punishes.  All right.  Well, we'll talk more about this tomorrow.  No matter whether you like it or not, that's what we're going to do, because it's my show.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Goodbye.  Yeah, it is.
