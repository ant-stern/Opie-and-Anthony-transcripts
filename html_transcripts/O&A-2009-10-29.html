<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the previous night's Yankees World Series loss. Opie recounted a humorous, jinxing text exchange with Anthony about the game's score.  The hosts extensively critiqued the Yankees' performance, focusing on A-Rod's poor showing and the Phillies' pitcher's dominance. They angrily lambasted their employer for failing to provide World Series tickets to a woman who’d hinted at sexual favors in exchange for them, resulting in another station securing the interview and the tickets. This sparked a rant about their employer's misunderstanding of their show's style and the missed promotional opportunity. The segment was punctuated by frequent mispronunciations of baseball players' names, jokes about Howard Stern's seemingly invisible presence in the building, and anecdotes about awkward elevator encounters with Stern's staff. A call-in segment and a studio guest, Laszlo (possibly to discuss an upcoming Xbox release), were featured, along with a comedic College Humor Batman video clip.

The show then transitioned into a discussion of a controversial *Curb Your Enthusiasm* episode where Larry David accidentally makes a Jesus painting appear to cry due to urination.  A call from Bill Donahue expressing outrage followed, leading to a debate about the humor and potential sacrilegious nature of the scene.  The hosts compared the show's dynamic to *Seinfeld* and pondered why Larry David didn't play George Costanza.  A call from Megan about the disappointing conditions of a supposedly luxurious underwater hotel shifted the conversation to painful sports moments in history, including the Red Sox' 2004 ALCS collapse and the Patriots' Super Bowl loss after an undefeated season. Patrice O'Neal joined the studio, contributing to the discussion of shaving and personal hygiene before contributing to the ranking of the most painful sports moments.

Next, the show featured video clips of a golfer's spectacular collapse at the 1993 British Open, using highly vulgar language to describe his performance ("fucking wanker," "deep fucking… you don't get out of it, type grass," "destroy himself").  Dave from Westchester called in, providing details about the golfer (Vandervelde) and the pre-inscribed trophy. This transitioned into "Jocktober," a segment mocking the John and Jeff Show, focusing on a photo seemingly showing one of the hosts with a young woman in a Thai bar.  The hosts repeatedly used "allegedly" to avoid legal trouble. The segment included discussions of racial preferences in romantic partners, a caller suggesting a name for Patrice O'Neal's comedy special, audio clips from the John and Jeff Show, and comments on an NFL game, Elvira, and Bernie Williams's jazz guitar playing.

The show continued with a trivia question interrupted by a rambling, offensive phone call from a newspaper delivery person. After attempts to continue the trivia with several callers (one admitting to urinating in a picture while playing Xbox), the conversation turned to the annoyances of married life, focusing on men's messy habits and double standards between men and women.  Crude jokes and discussions about infidelity and hygiene ensued. Patrice O'Neal called in, joking about his new album title using racial slurs. Laszlo from Rockstar Games and Bill Donohue from the Catholic League joined as guests. The conversation with Laszlo focused on the new Grand Theft Auto game, including descriptions of its sexual content.  A heated debate with Bill Donohue about the *Curb Your Enthusiasm* urination episode concluded the segment, characterized by insults, accusations of bigotry, and offensive language from all parties.

The final segment featured a lengthy discussion with Lazlo from Rockstar Games about *Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City*, with Patrice O'Neal and Bill Dutty (briefly) as guests.  The conversation touched upon the power and influence of media figures like Bill O'Reilly and Al Sharpton, contrasting it with the perceived lack of accountability for offensive comedians. Lazlo detailed the game's features (tank, base-jumping), engine, graphics, and voice acting, including anecdotes about Patrice O'Neal's experience. A humorous running gag involved Lazlo's supposed technical ineptitude. The segment concluded with a graphic on-screen depiction and discussion of a sex scene from the game, punctuated by frequent use of racial slurs and offensive language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road! 
[00:00:30]  Hey, good morning! Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show!  Hi! Yes, the mics work. Shut up.  Everything works, yes.  No, I was just telling Anthony about a really funny video I saw.  I don't even know if it's worth bringing to the show.  So, that Kevin Smith on Twitter retweeted a video from Funny or Die, which is a great website, about Batman disappearing. 
[00:01:00]  We all saw Batman and he just kind of disappears.  Yeah, like you'd be talking to him and stuff like that, and then he's gone.  And then you would ponder something that Batman's saying.  So, as you're pondering, you might be looking up at the sky, or you turn slightly, and then you turn back toward Batman, and he disappears.  And he was gone.  So, Funny or Die did a great parody of that.  Where they catch Batman trying to disappear, and then Batman's coming up with all sorts of excuses why he's not actually disappearing. 
[00:01:30]  The guy looked back a little too soon and caught him in mid-disappearing, leaving.  Iraq, if you want to go to Funny or Die and see if it's worth playing for the radio, I didn't retweet it.  I just clicked the link that Kevin Smith did on Twitter.  Anyway, sorry, Anthony.  What can I tell you?  Your Yankees blew it last night.  They suck, and they're going to lose to World Series.  What happened?  All right.  Is there a game? 
[00:02:00]  I think I blame myself.  Yeah.  It was weird.  I blame Opie.  Well, it was a big sports night for New York.  Yeah.  You had the Rangers and Islanders playing.  You had the Devils playing.  You had the Yankees playing.  The Phillies.  The Nets.  The Nets.  The Knicks.  Everybody was playing.  So, I mean, if you weren't watching one of those sports in New York, I don't know what you'd do.  Then you're a fag.  I was kind of going to say that. 
[00:02:30]  But that's not fair to the fags that do watch sports.  Exactly.  You're an uber fag.  Yes.  Javelin catching.  You know, they're small.  So, I'm at the Coliseum, and I'm watching the Islander Ranger game.  I wouldn't miss that for the world.  I mean, I eat a lot of tickets because I can't go to all the Islander games, but that's one I just can't miss.  That's the biggie.  So, I'm sitting there watching with my brothers and a couple Ranger fans.  We were switching seats off and on because we had seats all over the freaking Coliseum.  And in between periods, I go, I'm going to write my pal Anthony. 
[00:03:00]  Because it was really hard to get a score at the Coliseum for some reason.  I don't know why.  I don't know why they wouldn't just put up a fucking score.  Yeah, keep everyone updated considering that they made the choice to watch hockey when, you know, the Yankees are in the World Series.  When they finally saw the score, trust me, you know, the place wasn't happy.  There were a lot of Yankee fans that happened to be at the hockey game.  So, I go, you know what?  I'm going to write my pal Anthony and find out what the fuck's going on in this World Series game.  Yep.  So, I write Anthony, he goes, what was your... 
[00:03:30]  I go, oh, it's, yeah, they're in the third.  Yeah.  It's 0-0.  Yeah.  I said, great pitching.  Yeah.  And...  And I write, I wrote something like, okay, well, enjoy yourself, having fun at the game, whatever.  We're just, we keep in touch every once in a while, me and Ant, believe it or not, even though everyone thinks we hate each other.  And all of a sudden, he writes me back quickly.  I'm like, that's kind of weird because we already did the, all right, have fun, see you tomorrow, type of fucking text back and forth.  Yeah.  He goes, oh, fuck.  I go, jinx!  Jinx!  He just fucking times, jinx! 
[00:04:00]  I go, jinx!  It's 1-0, Philly!  Fuck, like, it was a second after I texted 0-0.  I'm like, jinx!  It was a homer, too, right?  Yeah!  I only saw the end of the game when I finally got home after the horrendous traffic back to New York City, so...  Yeah, so I kind of jinxed you, I think.  Yeah, that was...  And then I wrote you back.  I was like, what the fuck?  I wrote you back and go, I know we joke about this sports curse, but you gotta admit, it's a little weird at times.  That sucked.  I was like, damn, man.  And a little pitching duel, which, of course, Chet Lee from the Phillies won. 
[00:04:30]  Wow.  Well, you knew Lee was gonna be tough.  Everyone was talking about how tough he is.  Fucking, the full game, tough like he was, ridiculous like that.  You just, I mean, and those fucking two plays where he just catches that fly, and he's just standing there.  It looked like a cartoon character.  And then the behind-the-back catch, I mean, shit like that, that was a pitcher having one of the best games of his life right there. 
[00:05:00]  And even as a Yankee fan, you know, driving in, I was listening to Yankee fans talking on the news radio and everything like that.  And they were like, you gotta give it to him.  Yeah, of course.  What are you gonna do?  Fucking, hey, fuck them, fuck that, fuck this.  No, the guy pitched a ridiculously amazing game.  Yeah, your boys couldn't figure him out last night.  Could not.  Jeter got some hits off.  Jeter got some hits off of him, you know, but there's only so much you can do when one guy is hitting after two out, you know, and shit like that. 
[00:05:30]  But, amazing.  That guy is like a fucking cyborg.  Thank God he can't pitch every game.  So, that was rough.  And just great, great to see our good old postseason A-Rod back again.  That was nice to see.  He struck out three times, right?  Oh, he certainly did.  He whiffed.  What was he officially?  Oh, for what?  Did he walk a couple times? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, for four, I think.  All right.  I'm not sure, but just say every fucking time.  So, now what?  You Yankee fans hate Kate Hudson finally?  That bitch.  Are you going to give her the Jessica Simpson treatment, run her out of town?  I was trying to think what I'm going to do.  Like, I'll just be the guy that jumps right off the bandwagon after one loss and just go, fuck this.  I don't even watch the game anymore.  Fuck them.  Fuck them all.  I don't care.  No, that was a very tough, tough game. 
[00:06:30]  They shouldn't have played the game yesterday.  The rain shit was crazy.  They were playing games in the rain more than they used to.  I remember growing up, when it was just kind of drizzling.  Oh, they'd cover the field up.  The game stops.  There'd be like five delays during the fucking game.  Right.  Now they just fucking play the game.  The ball's rolling in the outfield, throwing up a rooster tail like a fucking speedboat.  Just slows down really quick.  Yeah.  Notice our phones are dead.  I think everybody is still sleeping. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Yesterday was one of those days where everyone was up late watching the World Series because  it's a big World Series for the nation.  Yeah.  Because you've got two big cities in it.  I know a lot of you don't care because you're not a Yankee fan.  Yeah, you're not one of them.  Or a Philly fan, but you're definitely taking a peek.  Just hope tonight, nice weather tonight.  It's going to be clear and dry that the Yankees can get in there.  You've got to win the next two now.  Against that fucking Red Sox, ex-Met motherfucker. 
[00:07:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh, Manny.  Uh, no, what's it?  Wait a minute.  Pedro.  No, Pedro.  I always get Manny and Pedro confused.  Yeah, Pedro.  Uh, fuck him too.  That's what I'm saying.  And I cannot wait until the Yankees buy Chetley.  I cannot wait for that purchase to go down when they finally do just shell out millions upon 
[00:08:00]  millions of dollars to make that acquisition because you know that they were just looking  at him going, we have to buy him.  We have to buy him.  That's why most of the country hates, you know, the Yankees.  Yeah.  Because they've all seen their star players, you know, be bought by the Yankee organization.  I don't care.  I'm getting all the names wrong.  What name did you get wrong?  I'm saying Chet and Manny.  Did you say Jetley?  It's Jetley.  First of all, it's Jetley.  No, it's Cliffley. 
[00:08:30]  It's Cliffley.  Cliff can suck my dick.  Yeah, Cliffley.  Well, look, you haven't slept yet.  Who has slept yet?  I'm fucking shell-shocked.  What was the final score?  6-1?  Oh, my God, yes.  They finally decided maybe they were going to try to rally in the bottom of the ninth.  I was pathetic.  Were you yelling and screaming, throwing shit?  Nah, no.  I was beyond that point.  I was at the disgusted remote in hand with the channel changer, which I do all the time. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  If the Yankees are losing, and it's the bottom of the ninth, two out, full count, I sit there  with the channel changer, and the second I see the ball caught, or something, no, I  got to see that it is over.  All right.  Then I just, bam, I hit and change the channel real quick.  Then I got fooled the other day, or last night, because I changed the channel real quick,  and then I look and go, oh, it says Seinfeld's on.  And I don't realize it's the same channel I just switched away from.  Right.  So I switch back on, and I go, yeah! 
[00:09:30]  I got to switch away again.  You ever turn off a sporting event thinking it's over?  You're convinced it's over?  And then some weird miracle's happening, and you're watching your Seinfeld, or you're watching  a movie, and you have no idea.  What happened?  And you find out the next day, they did what?  They scored 15 runs in the bottom of the ninth inning?  What?  What the hell is that about?  What?  No, look.  It's Brenda Lee.  Brenda Lee cannot.  Yeah, Brenda Lee is an amazing pitcher.  Brenda Lee can't pitch every game. 
[00:10:00]  Brenda Lee, shut down your Yankees.  There you go.  We finally got his name right.  Brenda Lee.  Fucking.  Chad.  Chad.  Chad Cliff.  Whatever.  Cliff.  Clifford.  Yeah, he was, wow.  It was very disturbing to watch.  The team that you were watching.  All season, and then the postseason, doing very well.  Not being able to hit the ball.  Well, they got a little cocky.  Now they regroup. 
[00:10:30]  Now they regroup and win four in a row.  That's what I say.  Is that how it works?  That's my prediction for you, your Yankees.  And for everybody that was texting and twittering, like, oh, that's it.  What about your Yankees?  It's done.  I didn't know it was, we were playing Super Bowl rules this year.  One game, and it's over?  It's over.  Was that it?  Yeah, you didn't get the memo?  That was it.  That's it.  Oh, okay.  Let's go to the phones.  They are there.  Thank God.  Because it would be very embarrassing for us to just talk to nobody. 
[00:11:00]  And when's the next time Kathy Lee is pitching?  I think game four.  Game four.  Yeah, game four, Kathy Lee will be pitching.  Kathy Lee will be on the mound.  Yes.  Do you get it?  John, what do you got, buddy?  Hey, that Finkelstein chick got her tickets from another radio station.  Fuck that bitch.  Yeah, fuck that bitch.  Fuck our company.  Fuck everybody.  We ran around here with our heads chopped off going, just give us a fucking pair of tickets. 
[00:11:30]  We got gold sitting here.  No, no, we have tickets.  We just couldn't give them away in that fashion.  Right.  Right.  We're supposed to be like this uncensored radio thing.  And a regular radio station did exactly what we could have done yesterday.  They're like, well, you know, some people would be a little, you know, we can't really give tickets away like that.  There was an actual email that came out after our interview with Susan that said she will absolutely not be getting tickets.  Yeah.  From the company. 
[00:12:00]  Why?  Yeah, so thank you.  Thank you to the company for blowing something that could have been even cooler than it was yesterday.  We would have been everywhere.  Did that really come out?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  I am stunned.  Yeah.  Yeah, it came out.  So this douchebag in Philly who's a cocksucker and a fucking asshole was able to get to her and give her a couple tickets to the World Series.  And the reason he's an asshole is because he made fun of all the, you know, cops dying and being shot to death in Philly. 
[00:12:30]  He thought it would be a fun Q of the D question for his stupid morning zoo radio show.  So go fuck yourself.  Whatever happens to you, you know, I'm going to laugh at you.  Maybe he'll get a little piece off her.  Huh?  Maybe he'll get a little piece off her.  Oh, really?  Yeah, maybe that'll close the deal.  Yeah, we had the great interview with the quote prostitute.  Yes.  That's quote prostitute, meaning not sure if she is a prostitute.  The alleged prostitute.  We had a really good time with her yesterday on the show.  You know, and she basically was hinting that she would do a little something something for World Series tickets. 
[00:13:00]  We had a great interview.  The interview went everywhere.  We made Breitbart and a bunch of other places.  And I guess that's what got the other guy, that fucking radio douche, the idea to give her tickets.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  So he swooped in and was able to do a little thunder stealing, as they call it.  And behind the scenes, if you were listening yesterday when we were trying to do the Hulk Hogan and Larry King thing, we were really distracted.  We couldn't really give that bit our all because we were doing all sorts of sign language with Danny and there were notes going back and forth. 
[00:13:30]  We're like, we've got to give her these fucking tickets.  We could do this.  Because that closes the deal.  Then we get some press.  And the reason we want press is because that's what the show is about.  That's what the company is about.  You're supposed to be in the news.  Right.  That way you get advertising and people check your show out.  Right.  That seems to be a good thing to do, especially when you get zero advertising normally. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  So it's one of those tactics where, what do you think, if we just have a couple of tickets  and we give them away in some other fashion, that it's going to get the type of press that  that would have gotten us?  No!  What a surprise.  15 years into this, we still have people behind the scenes that don't get what we're about.  Nothing changes.  I mean, they should have been running down the hall with a pair of tickets if they understood  how big that could have been yesterday.  I don't know what pissed me off.  They should have been running down the hall like, I got here, here, whatever I can do  to help you guys. 
[00:14:30]  You got the tickets.  You got the tickets.  Here.  Give it to her.  Give it to her.  Oh, okay.  Thanks.  Instead, we got a bunch of guys behind the scene that just fiddle about.  They just fiddle.  Fiddle.  And they take their time and have to, like, check with lawyers and this and that.  They do a lot of this and that.  I don't even know what it is.  A lot of this and that-ing, which completely takes away from spontaneity.  Spontaneity.  Which is like, you come up with an idea in radio and then you just do it.  Yeah.  There have been times it gets you in trouble.  You've got to-  It gets you pressed.  It gets you- 
[00:15:00]  That's what it takes.  You've got to have the balls to just, like, go with some of this stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, maybe they don't want to hear this, but Eric Logan would have ran down the  fucking hall with tickets for us yesterday.  He understands how big that would have been for the radio show.  Oh, his retard hair flapping in the breeze as he runs down here.  But instead, we got people just fiddling about doing this and that.  I don't know what got me more angry.  Are you watching Lee Harvey Oswald beat us yesterday pitching or fucking this company? 
[00:15:30]  Not giving us tickets.  You got the name wrong.  His name's Bruce.  Jesus.  Everyone knows this.  Bruce Lee.  Bruce Lee.  Oh.  All right.  I can never get it right.  No, it wasn't Sarah Lee.  Eli, what's wrong with you?  Watching-  Everyone knows it wasn't Sarah Lee.  Watching Cliff Clavin pitch was just astounding.  Who's responsible?  Oh, Kevin from Connecticut.  Very good.  Thank you.  John.  Yeah.  Yeah, so that was very depressing when, you know, that radio station took our thunder. 
[00:16:00]  When we had the woman right, we had her.  She wasn't going anywhere.  Yeah.  And she kept going, well, you guys going to give me the tickets?  And we're like, well, if you heard us, it was kind of wimpy.  We're like, well, we're doing everything possible.  And we're going to try to get this done and blah, blah, blah.  As we keep staring down the long hallway going, does anyone around here have balls?  She's like, click.  She must have been like, yeah, they ain't getting me tickets.  Who else? 
[00:16:30]  Who else can get me tickets?  And guess what?  These people think, you know, we're insane and all that.  The fact is, you watch.  Nothing is going to happen to this guy that gave the tickets.  No one's going to have a problem with it.  And all you have to tell the people that would have a problem is like, ah, it's Opie and Anthony.  You know, they did it as a goof for their entertaining radio show.  You know, they do that type of thing.  So we blew a big opportunity because people were fiddling about and doing this and that. 
[00:17:00]  I don't even know what they do.  Lame.  And then an email came out.  I don't know if it was from the actual person, but it got back to me.  Certainly it said, in no way will this woman be getting World Series tickets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From you.  In no way will she be.  Yeah.  Yeah.  From us, John.  From us.  Parish the thought the company's tied to something as scandalous as that.  Now, she's probably going to what?  Game four?  Yeah, in Philly.  She gets to see General Lee pitch. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  And where does that leave us?  Did you say Lee Harvey?  Of course.  You did?  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Just want to make sure that was out there.  Lee Van Cleef?  Or Lee Emery?  Or Lee Emery.  Or Emery.  How do you say his fucking name?  Ermy.  Ermy.  Right, right.  Lee Ermy.  I almost had it.  Motherfuckers.  I've got to watch that F. Lee Bailey on the mound one more time.  I'm going to be very aggravated.  I didn't know the spaceman is back in baseball.  Who's that?  Anyone?  Anyone?  Bill Lee?  Bill Lee.  All right. 
[00:18:00]  All right.  And of course, yeah, game four, Lee Majors.  Lee Majors.  Out there.  Giving it his all.  You sure it's not Kenny Lee?  Kenny Lee.  Enough about Lee.  So Susan Finkel...  That Finkelstein shit kid.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah.  Son of a bitch is right.  We got a little press in the paper today, but whatever.  Whatever.  We missed the big moment.  Yep.  We're more than willing to admit it.  And I didn't have personal World Series tickets. 
[00:18:30]  Ant didn't have personal World Series tickets.  No.  Because we would have just said, fuck it.  Take these.  Well, slow down, but...  We would have.  We fucking would have, man.  I wouldn't have Philly tickets, though.  Huh?  I wouldn't have Philly tickets.  No.  She only wanted Philly tickets.  Oh, I was texting my ass off with my Philly connections.  I'm like, anyone have them down there?  Help me out here, Henry.  Yeah.  Henry.  So, whatever.  Do whatever you fucking do in your stupid glass offices.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  15 years into it, we still don't have people that have balls enough to understand what we 
[00:19:00]  do.  It's the same thing.  Just fucking make things happen.  They are supposed to be the make things happen people.  Right.  We are the people that are on the air, you know, doing the radio portion, the broadcast,  the let's entertain the people portion, and you are the make things happen for us when  we need them to do our job.  Right.  You can't be the this and that guys.  This and that fiddling guy. 
[00:19:30]  Right.  We have this and that fiddle guys.  Because we have World Series tickets to give away, Ant.  Get his fucking picture off of there.  Who?  Iraq.  Who?  Fucking.  Who?  Fucking Lee.  Who?  Van Cleef.  Did we run out of Lees?  No, we did Lee Major.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  There you go.  There it is.  He's going to pitch a kid in the pool.  All right, John.  Thank you for bringing that to our attention.  Fucker.  No problem.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  So, another blown opportunity.  Thank you. 
[00:20:00]  Thanks for all the hard work behind the scenes trying to make the show better.  Whatever you fucking do.  Once again, we're holding up our end of the bargain.  Are you?  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Anthony stole my line, but here it goes anyway.  You guys just got outpitched by that guy in Philadelphia, just like Tommy Lee outpitched  the Yankees last night.  Ah.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know you were going to do that.  I'm sorry.  You stole my line.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, Opie, yesterday, the first hour of yesterday, you were on fire.  You had at least five or six great lines. 
[00:20:30]  So, whatever you did the night before, I don't know if you got laid or got a little anal.  Well, I know what happened was, I'm kind of like a cop.  You know, the end of the month comes and I got to start giving out all my fucking speeding  tickets.  You got a quota?  I got a quota.  I know.  My laugh quota, my funny quota is not as high as Jimmy or Anthony's because, you know, they're  stronger at that than I.  I do other things that, you know, they can't do.  It's just how it works.  Anyone that understands how this show is.  The mechanics.  But, I mean, I am required by my contract to get some laughs in, and I realized I was 
[00:21:00]  having a slow October, so I got to squeeze them all in at the end of the month.  It works like, let me think of a team, maybe, all right, the Phillies.  Right.  Let's see, you know, you got Spike Lee on the mound.  Now, he's not going to be able to go and catch.  Right.  But it works well with him on the mound.  We got an all-star team here.  Yeah.  I'm not the home run hitter, you fucking assholes.  Figure it out, you dopes.  You've been listening long enough. 
[00:21:30]  But I do have to get some laughs out.  And like that stupid, you know, that trooper on the side of the highway, I'm pulling everyone  over.  I'm going to be funny today, and I'm going to be funny tomorrow, and then I can fucking  cruise until the middle of November.  And then no-  That's what my contract says.  And then no-  No laughs.  No excuses.  No, no excuses once you pull them over.  Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  There's no getting talked-  You can't talk about the ticket.  No, because I got to fill my quota.  The quota's got to be filled.  Right.  If I was doing my job all month, then I could maybe let a few of these slide. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  No, I got to be funny today and tomorrow, big time.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Philly.  Charlie!  What's up, bubba boy?  Hey.  Charlie.  I can't believe they couldn't come up with a pair of World Series tickets for you guys,  but if Rosie O'Donnell called your show and said, I'm breaking up with my lesbian girlfriend,  like, uh, did, it would be plastered all over the TV channels like it was.  Oh, was it?  Who cares if her girlfriend's breaking up with her?  I swear I didn't hear that. 
[00:22:30]  The what?  Really?  She is?  Yeah.  Rosie's, uh, yeah.  Rosie's going to be in, in the middle of a, uh, an ugly lesbian divorce.  Oh, fuck.  That's fantastic.  How great is that?  And stupid Howard was kissing her ass.  Why are you kissing her ass?  The old Howard wouldn't be kissing her ass.  He should have played clips of everything he said about her for her entire career up until  when she was in there, I guess.  Mm-hmm.  Fat pig.  With a big head? 
[00:23:00]  How many fucking big giant Rosie O'Donnell head jokes were there?  Over the years.  Wow.  Oh, there were none.  They were just kissing each other's ass.  Oh.  I heard a little bit of that, actually, because the audio did make it out there.  Hmm.  So.  No, I actually heard it because I listen every day to Howard, and then I do exactly what  he does.  What?  Disappear?  I swear to you, how long have we worked here?  How long have we been in this building?  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[00:23:30]  Before you move on, because I know what you're getting at, because that was funny before  the show.  Thank you.  A little communique coming in.  Howard did a tirade years ago where he was protesting live on the air outside of her  TV show.  All right.  He marched down to where she was doing a TV show, and now they're both.  Maybe they met at the polo match and had a good time.  But anyway.  Someone was riding Rosie.  Somebody pointed out that, no, well, it was your thing, so. 
[00:24:00]  Well, we've been here for a while.  Over six months now.  In these new studios, yeah.  Um, I have not seen Howard.  I don't know of anyone that has seen him.  He disappears.  It's amazing.  And I don't understand how that happens.  Well.  How he, he, no one sees him. 
[00:24:30]  No, because.  And, and, and when, when he was, uh, brought here, you know, guys coming from radio with  a huge radio career and everything like that, they rolled out the red carpet, they rolled,  well, the green carpet, whatever you want to call it.  And, um, and, uh, he came in, uh, went to that wing, they shut the door, and, uh, that was it.  Yeah.  That was the last anyone ever saw of him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't understand how this works.  And, and, uh, I don't know, I, uh, trying to be a sort of a company guy, even though 
[00:25:00]  I'm really fucking pissed off at the guys that work for this channel today, really pissed  off because they're fucking lame.  Yeah.  We had a little moment there yesterday.  We had a great moment.  We had it robbed from us because we can't get, uh, people that have some, some balls to  just, you know, go with the, go with the bed.  Stop playing.  It's so safe.  Yeah.  Relax.  Talk to all the other guys who got fired before you.  It's okay.  They got other jobs after they got fired.  They were just fine in the end. 
[00:25:30]  Um, well, anyway, I guess what I could say is cause we'd like to have this place come  alive cause no one has really done that in this big, huge Sirius XM facility.  Yeah.  That's why we talk about the people that walk by the glass and we try to try to make this  place, uh, like a living, breathing fucking organism.  Yeah.  I thought the chatter was spelt different, but they were supposed to spell it like with the  E the E version of Sirius because that's what this fucking place is.  It's a little too serious.  Yeah.  They should just change the, the spelling to Sirius. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  We're serious.  You know, and I never have to work again in our lives because we fucking just took chances.  Do you understand why you want to be a run of the mill management guy?  No one's going to remember you.  Yeah.  Be the go getter.  Be an Eric Logan.  Yeah.  And then that other guy that might've been good for us back in the day.  I don't know who I have no idea.  I just know Logan and then everybody else fucking a distant second or third or fourth or fifth 
[00:26:30]  or sixth.  Logan and Logan was only fun for me because he was a drunk.  Yeah.  Now he's not.  So I don't know.  I probably wouldn't like him now anyway.  Well, he had to play for both teams though.  Yeah.  If you know what I mean.  Oh, well not that way.  No, I didn't say that, but you get, you know, you get somebody that's very high profile personality,  the highest profile personality, uh, in radio, uh, on board here.  It's serious.  And there's no, no co-mingling where maybe the excitement of having that in the building 
[00:27:00]  would rub off, uh, on the rest of it and kind of do that.  It's like the second the show ends to the bat pole, to the Howie pole, to the Howie pole,  Robin.  Hey, wait, your name's Robin.  Who?  To the Howie pole.  To the Howie car.  Can I bring people inside?  The Howie mobile.  Can I bring people inside too? 
[00:27:30]  Inside with what you just did?  You rarely fuck up, but you fucked up so bad right there.  It's supposed to be the Howie pole, and I said the bat pole.  We're fucking tired, man.  I'm punch drunk from being out half the night for the Islander Ranger game.  Anthony's watching the World Series.  I was beat up watching fucking Sarah Lee kill our team.  We actually fucking set up this bit nicely, because the chatter in the hallways is that  no one has seen him, and we've only been here six months.  We've never seen the guy.  And there are people well over a year, close to two years, and they go, I've been here 
[00:28:00]  like two years.  I haven't even seen the guy.  So then that's when Anthony goes, he probably has a Howie pole, like Batman has.  The Howie pole.  Has a fucking pole.  A yellow bat pole.  A yellow bat pole.  To the Howie mobile, Robin.  Here we go.  Ah, I don't think anybody saw us.  We're out.  Another day they didn't see me, Robin.  To the Howie pole. 
[00:28:30]  Quick, could you tint the windows a little more on my limo with black paint?  The driver can't even see.  It's just fucking.  Ah, the tint isn't dark enough.  It's just a fucking black mess.  It's amazing.  Yeah, he goes back to what?  The Howie cave?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's got a whole.  To the Howie cave.  He's got a whole Batman thing on.  Old school Batman, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Cartoon Batman from the TV show.  Old school. 
[00:29:00]  Fucking what's his name?  I forgot his fucking name.  The original Batman.  What?  Adam West, sure.  Adam West.  He's the Adam West thing.  Yeah.  Actually, yeah, it would be the Howie Vader.  To the Howie Vader.  And then he hits a basement and it goes down.  Amazing.  But I would just think someone, you know, we work the same hours.  We pretty much get here and leave at the same time.  You would think in all of those months, day after day, someone would have seen him. 
[00:29:30]  No.  No.  Is there any proof that he actually works here?  For real?  I mean, I know he has his own channel somewhere.  If I had to be put on a witness stand.  And say, does Howard Stern.  And say, does he work?  Does he do his show from this building?  I couldn't testify yes.  I would have to say, you know, Your Honor, I don't know.  I don't have any idea.  You would say, I hear he does.  Yes.  Rumor has it.  Rumor has it. 
[00:30:00]  He's been seen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How great is that?  I could not with total confidence testify in under oath that he actually is in this building.  And we joke that it's like a Bigfoot sighting.  Yeah.  If you have seen Howard.  If you have.  If you work for this company and you've seen Howard, you feel fortunate.  Take a blurry photo.  Right.  Woo-hoo.  Because he's walking through the hallway.  I don't know.  Is that him?  It's blurry.  I can't really see it.  You know, I walk around all the time with my HD flip.  I'm going to set up HD flips all over the place. 
[00:30:30]  I'm going to be the first person to actually capture.  To actually capture it?  How we in this building.  You just see like a size 14 shoe and some blurry hair or something.  Is this going to piss him off?  I don't know.  Well, I'm just talking about how we haven't seen him.  He doesn't have much of a sense of humor.  He's in the same building.  When it comes to us goofing on him for some reason.  He's not even really goofing.  It's just the fact that we've been here for months.  I've seen everyone else that works in this building.  I even saw that fucking Cousin Brucie guy. 
[00:31:00]  Everyone, yeah.  I saw Cousin Brucie.  Everyone, from the fucking top muckity muck all the way down to a janitor.  I have seen every single person that works here.  Except, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  I have not fucking seen it.  The Howie pole.  The Howie pole.  To the Howie pole.  To the Howie limo.  Into the Howie cave.  I don't think, uh...  Is anybody watching?  I gotta get to the Howie-mobile.  Quick robbing to the Howie cave. 
[00:31:30]  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Whiddle-dum-dum-dum.  Howie.  Howie.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  All right.  Oh, Howard doesn't broadcast from here.  That's why.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, this is...  We're getting some explanations.  Max in Dallas.  What's up, Max?  Hey, what's up, guys?  He doesn't broadcast from there.  He's a hologram like a Star Wars.  Oh, is that...  You think it's a hologram? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, when he leaves,  they put him on one of those sleds  like they did on The Running Man.  He goes down a tunnel.  Hey, that's funny, Max.  Thank you.  Haven't heard from Max in a while.  I remember him.  It's called a Howie-gram.  A Howie-gram.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.  Eric in Connecticut.  Eric.  Pat from Monaki.  Hey.  You gotta go for the stern squatch.  I won't do it.  It's just gone. 
[00:32:30]  Jordan writes,  okay, here's the real test.  He goes,  have you seen everyone else  on Howard's staff  except for Who Who himself?  Yes, I have.  Yeah, yeah.  We have to ride elevators  up with them sometimes,  and they are very angry people.  It's very uncomfortable.  They're very angry people.  The security in this place is...  You gotta walk through  and you got your security cards,  and then you gotta beep  when you get in,  and then you gotta beep  at the turnstile  by the elevator, 
[00:33:00]  and if you see, like,  Gary walking into  one of the elevators,  I always wait,  and, like, I'm just like,  I'll wait for the fucking,  you know,  to beep the turnstile  until I see the door close,  because I don't want  that uncomfortable elevator on,  and vice versa,  if I hear, like,  I hear Gary talking to somebody,  and I know he's coming  through the turnstile,  I'm banging that fucking  closed door button,  and then I'm standing  in a corner,  like, where it would be  the last possible minute 
[00:33:30]  someone could see you  before the door shuts.  Because we all come to work  at the same time.  It's just fucking...  I know for a fact  that just about everyone  on that staff  wants to punch me in the face.  I'm not stupid, right?  Just don't want small talk.  I was actually in the elevator  with Gary two days ago.  I was in first, by the way.  And the weird thing is,  there's probably  one, two, three...  How many...  Is there six or eight  that go up to this floor?  Seriously.  That whole area.  Is it six or eight?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Is it eight?  Eight elevators.  So, there's eight elevators  waiting to go upstairs,  because it's early in the morning. 
[00:34:00]  He decided he needed  to be in the elevator with me.  I'm like,  all right, whatever.  Maybe we'll have some small talk  and, you know,  ease some tension, right?  Yeah.  So, he comes in the elevator.  I'm already in there with Kenny.  And he just stares  at the elevator doors  as it's going up.  And I'm like,  why would you force your way  into this elevator  if it's going to be  uncomfortable for everybody  when you could have  been in the next elevator up  a mere two seconds later?  You didn't even have to wait.  So, fucking Kenny,  who rules,  forced Gary to have small talk. 
[00:34:30]  Really, did he?  Yeah, that's...  And someone named Lisa...  Lisa, what?  What's her name?  G or something?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she fucking hates us, too,  because she was in the elevator  at the same time  and just ignoring that  we're even in the same elevator.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  But Kenny forced both of them  to have small talk.  It was classic Kenny.  Just classic Kenny.  Because you'd have to be  a complete douchebag  not to answer Kenny.  Yeah.  So, some weather.  Yeah, that's what I mean. 
[00:35:00]  Like that shit.  Perfect small talk.  Like, it's going to be  a rainy day today, huh?  Gary had to actually go,  yeah, it is.  Oh, God.  What an ass.  Horrible fucking small talk.  Kenny's the worst.  What a prick.  I fucking enjoyed it.  And so I'm sitting there like,  all right, I get it, Gary.  You don't like me.  You probably want to  punch me in the face.  Why are you taking  the same elevator as me, then?  Wait for the next one.  Yeah, that's gotten  just, like, uncomfortable.  Trust me,  I tried with most of those guys.  I really did. 
[00:35:30]  I don't even have a problem.  No, who's a cool guy is Fred.  I see Fred at the gym,  and he couldn't be nicer to me.  And actually,  even though we had  a huge fucking fight  in the hallway  that almost got ugly,  me and Artie talk  all the time now.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I have no problem  with anybody.  It's just this  uncomfortable vibe.  And I just think  it's funny  that no one's seen him.  Is that Howard?  To me, that's funny.  Oh, no.  Okay.  It's funny, right?  When you said that,  all I saw was a shirt  go into a room. 
[00:36:00]  Like, that would have been like,  why do I saw  just like  something disappeared?  Just like Batman  disappearing  throughout the whole movie.  Christian Bale disappears  every time you turn around.  That's Howie.  We gotta set up cameras.  I'm gonna catch him on film.  Know the sad part  about that is?  No.  Middle management  will now sit me down  and go,  you know,  you're not really  gonna set up cameras, right?  Because that's gonna make him  very uncomfortable.  You know,  that could be a problem.  So I gotta make sure 
[00:36:30]  that was just for the radio, right?  See, for the security  of the building,  we can't have cameras  being on that aren't  our own security cameras.  Right.  So if,  are you serious?  Do you really think  I was setting up cameras?  Right.  And that's the definition  of this and that.  That's what they do.  This and that.  The fucking  Sonny Corleone,  your camera,  like at the wedding,  throw some money  on the floor at you.  Yeah.  Spit on you.  Yeah.  Bastard.  Fucking Kenny, though. 
[00:37:00]  It's gonna be a rainy day, huh?  Yeah.  Boy, this is early.  That's really dumb stuff.  I don't know.  Never get used to these hours.  Where is Kenny?  No, you don't.  Does Kenny want to  contribute to this?  I'm sure Kenny's busy.  He's gotta back me up  a little bit  because it was classic.  I'm working.  I'm mailing out  Anthony's mail.  He's been in my mailbox  now for years. 
[00:37:30]  I don't think  I've been to a mailbox  and dropped mail  in years.  I just,  I take all my letters  and envelopes  and hand them to Kenny  and he mails them.  I got a trivia question  for you and I.  And be honest.  Me and you together,  I want to figure out  what a stamp costs.  Do you know what  a stamp costs right now?  For real?  Oh.  Oh,  I bought those  forever stamps  a while ago.  I'm gonna guess 32.  No.  It's higher?  It's in the 40s now.  No.  I'll say 46. 
[00:38:00]  46?  43.  41.  42.  39.  42?  40.  42 cents.  Were you off?  44.  I was off by 10 cents.  How much is a postcard?  Was I really off by 10 cents?  Wow.  Nah.  I swear to God,  I thought it was 32.  Nah, 32.  It was 32.  That was a while ago.  It was fucking 10.  I don't remember  what stamps were 
[00:38:30]  when I was a kid,  but I'm sure they were  like three cents  or something.  Five cents.  I don't know.  Do you like us?  Who's that?  I just like to ask  that question  as these people  walk by the studio.  I think we got  a lot of people that,  we've turned a lot  of people around here.  I've turned people around.  Mars,  have we turned  people around?  No.  Yes.  No,  I'm telling you,  we have.  When we got here,  everybody fucking hated us.  I mean everybody.  Even the people  that hired us  were like,  ugh,  can't believe  we have to hire  these guys,  but we got to  keep them close.  We don't want  to compete against them. 
[00:39:00]  Watch these highlights.  Stop it.  Stop playing it.  We know how it ended.  Well,  they're supposed  to do that.  Ah.  Mars.  Christopher Lee.  Fucking kicking our ass.  Christopher Lee?  Who's Christopher Lee?  An old horror movie actor.  Oh.  What movie?  Oh God,  he was in a lot of vampire movies  and things like that.  Saw?  I believe he might have been  in Star Wars.  Was he in Saw?  No.  I know that horror movie.  No.  Mars,  have we turned this place around?  Yes,  you have.  There's quite a few people  that got turned on to you guys. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah?  Yep.  Well,  I want to thank those people  for having an open mind.  A lot of people don't have  an open mind  when it comes to us.  Yeah.  I was reprimanded  by Kenny  for disturbing him  while he was eating  his bagel.  Oh.  Where's he eating his bagel?  Where does he eat?  Oh.  And he must do that  all the time.  Like,  he's a very ritualist.  He has to follow a routine.  He's got a ritual  that can't be broken.  I think he needs his energy  so he can fetch stuff  for us all day long. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  He needs his energy.  He's fetching things.  He needs his fetching energy.  He's always fetching our stuff.  Here comes Kenny.  He's gotten to the point.  Like,  I got a backpack  that I bring in.  I can't even carry it.  He won't allow me  to carry it.  He looks like a mortician today.  Why do you look  like a mortician?  Let's talk about  Morris the cheese-eating rat.  Oh!  Damn!  Why don't you go back  to the shop  and play with some switches?  Oh! 
[00:40:30]  Oh, shit!  Little suck-ass.  Damn!  Why?  Why?  Yeah.  Kenny, put him in a hole.  Oh, Kenny's eating  his bagel, G.H.  Anthony, he's sitting  in the office.  Oh, can I do it?  Can I push a button  for you guys?  Oh, shit!  Oh, fucking cheese-eater.  Kenny doesn't like that.  You're a fucking rat  at me right now.  Yeah.  That's from his old days  on the fucking job.  He don't like the rats.  We don't talk about each other  behind their backs around here. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, he comes running  down the office.  Kenny, they really want you  on the radio.  I have ears, Mars.  These guys know  how to entertain.  They didn't need me  to chime in.  All right, but now,  you know,  when we got to talk  about rats,  I have no problem.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit, man!  Those are fighting words.  Get into your fighting  stance, Mars.  He did come down  right now.  He did come running in.  We're taking up  a collection for Mars. 
[00:41:30]  He wants to go to Boston  so he can touch men.  Oh, shit!  I think we collected  17 cents.  That's what people  think about him  around here.  Oh, wow!  What the hell?  Where's this coming from?  Yeah, tell him about  your big trip to Boston  so you can touch men.  You're going to Boston?  No, you can't.  I can't.  Why?  To touch men?  It was a tournament,  a judo tournament  that I wanted to attend,  but I can't afford it.  Oh, a man-touching event.  How much does it cost?  Uh, about 350. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, good luck to you.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  Stupid.  You just fucking  walked into a right hook,  you idiot.  Yeah.  Dumb as shit.  Me and Kenny  had a little problem  outside our building.  I go, Kenny,  let's take care of this problem.  I'll go in first.  I'll fucking start the fight  and when I'm starting  to get my ass kicked,  you come in  and beat the shit out of the guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, cocksucker  was blocking my spot  this morning.  We were going to take care  of that, right, Kenny?  Yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Fucking motherfucker.  Kenny.  Yes, sir?  Were you forcing  small talk on Boyd Gary?  No, I'm a very sociable person.  I don't want to misrepresent.  It was a very awkward  elevator ride.  And we don't understand  why he would do that  to himself.  Why wouldn't he just wait  for the next elevator?  I turned a negative  into a positive.  I'm that type of guy.  Yeah.  What kind of questions  were you asking him  that he didn't want to answer?  I know you said  it was going to be  a rainy day  and something about 
[00:43:00]  how it's really early.  Yeah, it was an interrogation.  You are just...  You will never lose  that part of you.  And it's charming.  That part that would  beat someone with a phone book  to get info out of him.  Yeah, that's just...  It's part of you.  Oh, Kenny wasn't harassing nobody.  No, no, I mean that...  But that whole...  He was just small  talking his ass off.  The mindset that Kenny has  is of that...  and everything.  You're very nostalgic to see.  I enjoy looking at the... 
[00:43:30]  how it was back  in the good old days.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yes.  No, I treat people  like I want to be treated.  Kenny, have you seen Howie yet?  We've been here six months.  Hoo-hoo-hoo!  He just kind of like...  doesn't exist, right?  No, I speak to Ronnie.  Ronnie's been nice to us, right?  Yeah, Ronnie, you know...  We've had some nice  small talk with Ronnie. 
[00:44:00]  It's all good.  This place is terrific.  Yeah, we see the peripherals.  All the peripheral players,  but, you know,  you don't see the principle.  Yeah, but now someone's  going to spin that.  See, they're obsessed  with Dave Kibbe.  No, it's just an observation.  It's a very good observation.  It's what it is.  It's the same fucking building  at the same time.  You find the Batman thing?  What?  Iraq, you find the Batman thing?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, my God.  Iraq is terrible  at that station.  Wow, Iraq, what's up?  He's not on mic and...  What's up, man?  You're filling in for Danny today.  Travis was just  filling in on something.  That's all.  Yeah, well, Travis  Travis fills in Danny, too.  Danny has...  He can multitask.  That's true.  You're filling in  for Danny's position  until we fill that position  now that Danny's been fired.  Well, got to do  what I got to do.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That was a little lippy, Opie.  I know.  It's all right.  All the abuse we give him,  I allow a few shots back.  He earns it.  No shit, he does. 
[00:45:00]  He certainly does.  They know not to cross the line.  That's right, Kenny.  Yeah.  Or else then you got to deal with,  you know, who, Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because if anybody got a problem  with you guys,  they got a problem with me.  I like that.  Yeah.  I like that.  Are you leaving now?  Sure.  All right.  And then he just walks away.  Ha, ha, ha.  There he goes.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  He just walked out.  He walks out.  Sure.  He's doofy and he's dopey.  He sounds a little mopey. 
[00:45:30]  A manservant to Opie.  He's club soda, Kenny.  He's got his daily checklist.  That's your horn.  It starts with Opie's breakfast.  He's on him like a necklace.  He's club soda, Kenny.  Security.  XPD.  OCD.  Whatever you need, call him.  No wonder Opie doors him.  He wipes Opie's pot for him.  He's club soda, Kenny.  Holy shit. 
[00:46:00]  Sure.  And then he's happy to go.  He doesn't care.  Hey, you want to see if this Batman thing works for radio?  I want to thank that Kevin Smith on Twitter for turning me on to it.  He retweeted it.  And I clicked that fucking link and I laughed my ass off.  It's a parody of Batman disappearing from, you know, the Batman movie.  And this is the scene where Commissioner Gordon played by a guy with a red beard.  He looks like the rising cable guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He looks like him a little bit. 
[00:46:30]  They're on the roof with the bat signal and the, you know, he called Batman.  So now they're having a little talk on the roof.  Yeah.  If you saw the movie.  And then in the movie, you know, they turn around to ponder or think, think of, think of something.  Next thing you know, Batman's gone.  Well, they're kind of parodying that.  Let's see if this works.  Go ahead.  From Funny or Die, by the way.  Looks like we're making progress.  Shot very well.  We can track the money now, thanks to you.  Lightly radiated bills. 
[00:47:00]  The mob doesn't know that the money's been marked.  We should be able to trace it back to its source and prosecute.  There's a willing DA.  Harvey Dent.  Can he be trusted?  Hell, he seems to be about the best that we've...  What was that?  What, are you sneaking away?  No.  Is this your little vanishing routine?  What?  Is this the part where I turn and then I turn back and all of a sudden you're gone?  No.  Everybody's impressed.  Harvey Dent.  Can he be trusted?  Well, he seems to be about the...  Seems to be about the best that we've got. 
[00:47:30]  Harvey Dent.  Can we trust him?  Seems to be about the best that we've got.  Batman's gone.  Or is he?  He's looking around.  And there's Batman trying to hide.  Batman.  Batman.  He caught him hiding.  I found something.  You found some?  I found some.  You found some something?  Evidence.  You found some evidence.  I found evidence.  You found some evidence over there.  Here.  Okay. 
[00:48:00]  Someone left some evidence.  We would have never found that evidence without you.  I'll analyze it.  With science.  We are always in your debt, Batman.  Harvey Dent.  Can we trust him?  Yeah.  Oh, well.  He seems to be about the best.  Wait.  Okay.  Wait one second.  I'm sneaking off of you.  Okay.  Don't look for a second.  He's the best.  Don't look for a second.  Now?  Wait for a second.  Hold on.  Okay. 
[00:48:30]  Now.  Wait.  No.  Not now.  Not now.  Yeah?  No.  Okay.  Now.  About the best we've got.  Got it.  About the best we've got.  And then he's gone.  That's fucking funny.  Where is it?  Actually.  Can you leave that on?  I dropped my wallet.  I gotta go to bed.  Swear to me!  It's pretty fucking good.  It's from College Humor.  Not funny or die?  Fuck.  It's done very well. 
[00:49:00]  Sorry.  I like the boys at collegehumor.com.  You can find it on collegehumor.com.  Someone's saying the quality of the audio sucks there, Mars.  Really?  It sounded perfect to us in our headphones.  It sounded fine.  What are they saying down there?  Was the audio all right?  They're saying it's muffled.  Muffled?  What the fuck is that about?  I have no idea.  Did they take a little bandwidth away from our channel?  Because we're getting some complaints lately.  I think we got just crappy bandwidth. 
[00:49:30]  Why, man?  Give us some fucking bandwidth.  Because we're talk, not music.  No, we're more than music.  This is the argument we had with XM day one.  Because, you know, the engineers, oh, talk?  Okay, then boom.  Give them this much bandwidth.  We're more than a talk show.  We're playing music.  We got a lot of production value behind what we do.  Yeah.  You know, we're not like a boring fucking Bob Edwards just babbling.  Just him and a dumb microphone.  Then you need a little bandwidth.  We need more than that. 
[00:50:00]  First break yet?  Yes.  All right.  We're going to do that.  What do we got today?  We got Patrice O'Neill coming in for Jimmy, who's doing the Leno thing tonight.  Very cool.  Make sure you check out Jimmy on Leno tonight.  Doing one of his uninvited guests.  Those things are taking off and kicking ass.  There's Laszlo in studio.  What's that about?  Well, I think something new's coming out for the Xbox.  Yeah?  Is this an exclusive for us?  I don't know.  Maybe someone will just take it.  Right.  Maybe we're not allowed to talk about it, and management will say no, and then, I don't 
[00:50:30]  know, Chino, or Chico, or Cheeho, or whatever his name.  Kehoe.  I don't know what the fuck his name is.  We'll sweep in.  Fucking.  Swoop in, I should say.  Chuck Lee.  Chuck Norris.  Chet.  Cliff Clavin.  And then our old, do you call him a nemesis?  What is Bill Donahue?  Yes, he would be our old nemesis.  Nemesis, right?  Yes.  Can he be trusted? 
[00:51:00]  He officially got us fired for the Sex for Sam thing, and now, for some reason, I guess  everyone forgives, and now he calls our show.  It's kind of weird to me.  I still hold a fucking grudge.  No surprise there.  I don't think he got us fired, but I think he was a big part of management buckling.  He sure didn't help matters, eh?  No.  No.  But he was doing what, you know, it's like, who said that?  Chris Rock?  It was the tagger didn't go crazy.  The tagger went tiger. 
[00:51:30]  You know?  It's like, that's what he does.  That's a great line.  That's just what he does.  He's not supposed to think of our jobs and our this and that.  He does what he does, which is defend the Catholic faith with all his might.  Sometimes he's, you know, has a point.  Sometimes he's completely dead wrong, in my opinion.  Right.  But he'll always do it.  And I think E! Online just posted that he's going to be on our show today.  So we got another big get for the radio show. 
[00:52:00]  So hopefully the this and that people won't ruin this.  Let us do this our way.  Bill Donahue's calling the show because there's some controversy about Curb Your Enthusiasm.  You finally see the episode?  I saw it last night.  It was pretty good, right?  Goddamn funny, man.  The interaction between him and Jerry Seinfeld is really funny.  That diner scene where they're sitting in the booth and then Richard Lewis comes in.  Each one doesn't want to slide over.  He goes, oh, you want the luxury suite?  And you can see how the whole Seinfeld show came about. 
[00:52:30]  It's Larry David's vision, obviously.  Everyone knows that now.  But to see him kind of just interact with Jerry, this is how it was.  It's a Jerry-George dynamic that the two have, even though Jerry's personality is in there, too, and Larry David, too.  Sure.  But you could definitely see where they got the ideas for the show.  Now, you know everything about Seinfeld. 
[00:53:00]  Well, no, Travis does.  Travis is a little better than you?  I've seen quite a few.  Answer this question.  Why didn't Larry David play George?  Because we're all seeing that Larry David is great to watch.  They goof on things about that, too.  They goof on the fact that, like, because he's not an actor.  He's like, you know, you don't have the guy that is the guy play the guy.  They were talking about that in the episode last night.  He goes, what, is Nixon supposed to do Frost Nixon?  Right.  Because he's, you know, he's Nixon because he's not an actor.  He's not an actor.  I don't think Larry David thought he was an actor. 
[00:53:30]  I think it was tough enough that Jerry wasn't an actor.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so obvious Jerry isn't an actor.  Jerry's a really bad actor.  He's laughing his way through every fucking scene, which, you know, is funny anyway.  I don't care.  I don't know.  I think, well, I was ready to say I think they missed the boat, but, I mean, Seinfeld,  obviously a massively huge show, so what the fuck am I saying?  Huge hitter.  But he could have easily pulled off George.  Yeah, but fucking not.  Now that we all are Curb Your Enthusiasm fans.  Not all, but a lot of us. 
[00:54:00]  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  That one, it's hard to think of somebody else playing George.  Well, Jason Alexander did great job.  Yeah, he did a great job.  But Bill Donahue, very mad because Larry David, in the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode that ran  last Sunday, I guess, you know, took some kind of pill for his urinary problem, and now  he had a nice flow.  He had a huge fire hose-like stream.  Couldn't really control it, and he was in somebody's bathroom, and they had a painting  of Jesus, and he didn't officially pee on Jesus, but his pee was shooting everywhere, 
[00:54:30]  bouncing off the toilet, bouncing back up, and hit Jesus in the eye, and it made it look  like Jesus was crying.  He was crying.  And now everyone was excited because they really thought the Jesus painting is crying,  and now they were going to take the painting on tour like those dummies do when they see  Jesus in a piece of toast or something.  And a potato chip or something, yeah.  So it was a pretty good episode, but Bill Donahue is outraged, and he's going to be everywhere  today talking about it.  Yeah, it's not Larry David pissing on a picture of Jesus or desecrating anything on purpose. 
[00:55:00]  It wasn't dwelled on.  You know, they didn't dwell on it.  It was part of a storyline that I think was handled perfectly for that storyline.  And if you believe in the Jesus character, right?  Yeah.  The midriff thing?  The midriff top girl is fantastic.  How do you cast that?  We need a chick with a big gut.  Yeah, she's standing there.  She's an actress.  Yeah.  And she knows that she got the part because she can't handle her food intake. 
[00:55:30]  Because she's got a big gut, and they put pants that are too tight on her.  Right.  And she kind of has like E-Rock's belly a little bit.  It's white.  It's soft and nice.  Right, E-Rock?  It's cushiony.  It's cushiony.  It's a little cushy.  But I guess Larry David's assistant insists on wearing these midriff shirts, even though  she doesn't have the body for it.  And that was basically what the episode was about for the most part.  Yeah.  And this actress had to be cast as the girl that's a bit too chubby for a midriff. 
[00:56:00]  The way Jerry looks at her gut.  Yeah.  That's fucking hysterical.  Every erection is a miracle.  So.  Anyway, I'm sad to tell you.  All right, well.  That's great.  So Bill Donahue's calling the show today to talk about the controversy.  We'll talk to him about that.  My thought is really simple, though.  If you believe in the Jesus character, and he gave us humor and sense of humor.  Well, God did.  God, right.  Not Jesus.  Well, I understand.  Jesus is the son of God.  But some people say Jesus is God. 
[00:56:30]  Jesus is Lord.  Yeah, it's all very confusing.  Jesus is the king.  Very.  Whatever.  But Jesus kind of had a part in that whole thing.  Yeah.  So wouldn't God have a sense of humor, too, if he gave us all a sense of humor?  I believe they see that as very sacrilegious.  But who invented sacrilegious?  Wow.  Boy.  Huh?  Well, let me tell you.  Back in the old days of Christianity and Catholicism.  Boy, they...  But who invented sacrilegious? 
[00:57:00]  I think...  Because God did it.  The Spanish Inquisition!  That's human interpretation.  And that's one of the problems with religion, my friend.  Yes.  It is human interpretation.  I have a problem with organized religion in general.  Yeah.  Because it's...  I think that's where a lot of the issues come.  It's people making up their own kind of idea.  But, again, what it is is what it is.  So, you got...  You know... 
[00:57:30]  You got to fill...  What if God thinks this episode was hilarious?  You know, he's created everything at this point.  And God watches curve?  He's sitting back and enjoying his creation at this point.  What else is he creating?  Yeah.  Well, Bill Donahue's job is to police the airwaves for things that offend the Catholics or offend  him or offend people that write into him.  He doesn't get anything done, by the way.  Reverend Allen, you know...  Well, he got us fired, kind of. 
[00:58:00]  That was like his big thing.  Why are we the only thing he ever got done?  We're his only hit.  Fucking Reverend Allen's getting...  He's a one-hit wonder.  Reverend Allen gets people fired all over the place.  Listen, Bill Donahue yells and screams, and the only thing he accomplished was getting  us fired.  Bill Donahue's a one-hit wonder.  Fucker.  Motherfucker, wear his hit.  He ain't fucking calling our show today.  Tell him to go fuck himself.  His best days are behind him.  Oh, a hotbed of Catholic jokes Bill Donahue was saying lately, and that David, his best 
[00:58:30]  days behind him, should quit while he's ahead.  Oh, Larry David's best days behind him.  Okay.  I don't know.  You know something?  Larry David, as part of Seinfeld, was great, of course.  The writing and everything like that.  The ideas.  The characters.  But Curb Your Enthusiasm, it's amazing to go from a show like Seinfeld to a show like  Curb Your Enthusiasm and have that be as quirky, funny, and successful as it is.  So I give him credit.  I don't think his best days are behind him.  It's frustrating that the Seinfeld people only signed on for, what, five episodes?  Yeah, but it's kind of cool. 
[00:59:00]  It would get, you know, it would get kind of old.  It's fun, though, to see the characters come out like that, even in just the way they  are.  I wish they would just...  In real life, you know.  I know they're all very expensive now and all that, but I wish they would just do it  because it's so fucking cool.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, do a whole full season with Larry.  Jeez.  They kind of owe it to Larry, if you think about it.  Well, I'm sure Larry made a few bucks.  True.  But he could have freaking...  Yeah, but he could have, you know...  I'm sure there's other actors that could have done it. 
[00:59:30]  Just recast it.  Recast all of the characters and try to do Seinfeld with completely new characters.  Yeah, do it black.  Black Seinfeld?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you laugh.  Give it another ten years.  That'll happen, too.  All right, we're babbling now.  We're going to take a break, regroup.  World Series stuff.  Yeah, we'll do a little more of that.  Oh, someone said, Pat from Minaki says, just use the Bizarro Jerry episode, people.  I was thinking that when you were saying that.  Bizarro Jerry.  What was Kramer's name in that one? 
[01:00:00]  Feldman.  Feldman.  Right?  We just call him Feldman.  We're going to read.  Goddamn, that's great.  All right.  And the underwater hotel lady's calling.  That was yesterday, Megan.  You're killing us.  Oh, Megan.  We wanted to talk to you.  We'll talk to Megan after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  A lead here by five in the bottom of the ninth inning, and Cliff Lee has allowed only two 
[01:00:30]  earned runs in 33 postseason innings.  Ends it with a strikeout of Jorge Posada.  And total dominance on the part of the left-hander, Cliff Lee, who was sensational here tonight  for Philadelphia.  Go home and get your fucking shine box.  Boo!  I'm breaking your balls on you, no matter what you're getting fucking fed. 
[01:01:00]  This is going great.  I know.  I know.  Wow.  Where it takes for nothing?  No kidding.  When the Yankees lose, his call's a little different, huh?  That's the John Sterling character.  Just a tad.  You know, I was listening to John Sterling.  I'm not a big Yankee fan, so I don't listen to a lot of Yankee games on the radio, but  I was coming back from the Coliseum.  Islanders beat the Rangers last night, which was, that's a big win for us. 
[01:01:30]  Yes.  Whenever we can beat the Rangers, it's big for us.  So I turned on the game on the way back to the city, and I'm listening to John Sterling  call the game.  And I'm thinking to myself, this fucking guy knows how to call a baseball game.  It's only when the fucking, well, of course, last night it would have sounded good because  you didn't have any home runs.  Right, right.  You barely had any hits, so.  If we would not, if he would just knock off that home run call shit and the Yankees win  shit, it would be pretty good.  Well, see, I don't like that because it means that no one got home runs. 
[01:02:00]  I understand.  And the Yankees didn't win.  But the point is, I don't think he needs all that gimmicky stuff.  Well, he doesn't, no.  He calls a good baseball game.  You want to talk to the underwater hotel lady?  Yeah, well, that was from yesterday.  I guess we were doing Jocktober, and the host of the show and the whole on the show are  apparently engaged.  And they were talking about getting married and what they were going to do and where they  were going to get married and honeymoon.  And one of the places somebody brought up was the underwater hotel, and they were talking 
[01:02:30]  about it like it was, you know, this luxurious underwater hotel.  One guy couldn't even believe it existed.  And I'm just laughing.  That isn't the same one, is it?  I don't know.  No, that's a different one.  Yeah, maybe that's an updated one because Megan...  That doesn't even look real.  Megan worked at, I believe, the original one.  It's been an underwater hotel for, I think...  How long, Megan, has it been an underwater hotel? 
[01:03:00]  Ten years, maybe?  I'm not sure.  Ten years.  And you've got to remind me, what did you do for the hotel?  I worked for the marine science camp that was right there, so we would take kids out in  a lagoon right there, and I would help out if they needed help with the hotel.  And you keep nurturing these fantasies about the splendor of it, because I heard you talking  about a tunnel again yesterday.  There's no tunnel.  No.  So there isn't a tunnel.  You've got to, like, scuba dive down to the hotel?  Yes.  Look, I've got to bring up something that just happened here.  Sure.  E-Rock was at the helm. 
[01:03:30]  Of course, Danny, not here.  So E-Rock is at the helm and punches up this fucking picture of a beautiful,  beautiful underwater hotel.  Dolphins are swimming by.  There is indeed two tunnels going into this luxurious, it's called the Poseidon.  Can I just stop you for a second, because I know what picture you're talking about.  Yeah, it's under construction in Dubai, or at least it was. 
[01:04:00]  Until they ran out of money.  That was all CGI.  And E-Rock's like, here it is.  No.  We're talking about the 55-gallon rusted drum.  What, you got water in your ears?  You don't hear me talking?  Megan.  Huh?  Yeah.  Now it's your turn.  Let's go.  Yeah, what's up?  No, I know what picture you're talking about.  Yes, it's the only one right now.  So people see that one, and they get all excited.  But I don't think I made it clear the first time how the lagoon that it's in has these 
[01:04:30]  boats with these guys who have been living in the Keys for about 80 years.  So they've all been grandfathered, and it's a national park, but they don't have to follow  any of the pollution laws, because they've all been there so long.  Yeah.  So they literally dump all their gray water and their sewage water right on top of the  hotel.  Like, I'm not exaggerating.  It's a shit hotel.  So, yeah.  You see people floating by, and the people are like, oh, it's algae.  It's all the natural algae growth that's floating by.  Yeah.  It's not.  It's literal shit.  It's shit falling down in front of the windows of this beautiful underwater hotel. 
[01:05:00]  Jules Undersea Luxury Package.  Yeah.  And you told us it smells, and it's very damp, and right?  Yeah, it's just like being inside a sub.  It's a round tube, apparently, that is underwater, and it's musty, and mildewy, and rusty, and  horrible.  Apparently, those little fish pillows cost like $200 each, because that's really the 
[01:05:30]  only luxury you get when you want it.  That's the luxury.  I do see, is there an oven in there?  That seems dangerous.  Yes.  That doesn't seem smart.  Yeah, there's a little tiny oven, because the guy that brings you down will cook you  up a little steak down there.  That's your luxury dinner that you get when you want it.  Doesn't it just smoke the whole place out?  How do you ventilate?  I don't know.  They must have a little, I guess, one of the hoses that goes to the top does that.  Oh, there's like a little chimney-type thing that might go up top.  And how far down is this thing? 
[01:06:00]  25 feet.  25 feet.  25 feet.  So you got it.  Yeah, when the kids are snorkeling, they can snorkel down to the top of it.  And the really good kids that can swim down far can peek in the windows of people in there.  Oh, so you have no privacy.  That's great.  And is there kind of an airlock, or is it one of those, you go down to the bottom and  pop up through the top thing?  Yeah, yeah.  That's how it is.  Like, there's no door.  You know, it's a little pool when you're inside.  Oh, so it's pressurized.  Yeah.  So how the fuck does the exhaust work for the oven? 
[01:06:30]  And now I'm fucking boggled, because that would release the pressure.  Maybe it's like a hot plate he cooks on.  I have no idea.  It just smokes out.  You just got to deal with the fucking smoke.  Like you're in a submarine that got hit with a depth charge.  Goddamn, this place sucks a dick.  How do you get your luggage down?  We forgot.  You use an airtight suitcase, like the type of suitcase that you use for an underwater camera 
[01:07:00]  that snaps shut, you know, with a seal.  Yeah.  And so you can only bring so much luggage with you.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, they kind of pack it up on the surface.  So, of course, the old guy is doing all this.  He's like the Honeymooners lingerie and all that.  If you're packing it into the airtight suitcase.  Big dildos.  Big fucking monster cocks.  What do you do down there?  Black fists.  What's there to do down there?  Well, they have The Abyss.  That's a big movie everyone watches down there.  So you watch movies of underwater places? 
[01:07:30]  You really just watch The Abyss, because if I remember correctly, that was like the one  movie they always had down there.  Once you bring your own.  Are there some kind of like, is there like a research thing you can do?  Sort of a, can you participate in any science?  Well, you can go out snorkeling in the lagoon.  So you can, like, whenever you want, you can go out through that little pool.  But the lagoon, like I said, it doesn't have any coral or anything.  It has lots of, it has fish because they're eating all the algae and stuff. 
[01:08:00]  The shit.  They're eating the shit.  They're being polite.  That, it just, every, you know, every time I talk to you about this, it just makes me  sick that it exists.  You would think they could come up with something really cool by now.  Yeah.  Oh, there's a wet room chamber.  Hold on.  Go back to the wet room chamber.  Yeah, that's where you change into your stuff.  Okay.  10 feet by 20 feet length with a ceramic tiled deck.  All right. 
[01:08:30]  That might be pressurized.  I just can't figure it out.  I'm going to have to research this joint.  Yeah.  And how much does it cost?  How much does it cost?  Well, I remember it being like 300, but I think the last time you guys looked, it was  even more.  It was like 400 or 500 or something.  500 bucks.  It's going to rip off.  It's weird though.  You go to Florida, you go to a hotel, and you're stuck in the hotel the entire time  when you probably want to be outside where it's really nice.  1,000.  Except the rip off.  Hold on.  The ultimate romantic getaway package, perfect for honeymooners, or would-be honeymooners. 
[01:09:00]  This package offers all the amenities of the Jules Undersea Luxury Package, but with  the guaranteed exclusive use of the world's only underwater hotel, so you get it all by yourself.  Extras include mood music, fresh flowers, seafood appetizer, and Merschef service for breakfast.  While you're visiting Jules Undersea Lodge, earn yourself a P-A-D-I, or not a patty, or a 
[01:09:30]  naughty certificate.  Not a, like nautical.  That's scuba shit.  Certificate by taking our Habitat specialty, Jules Undersea Lodge is the only place where  you will ever earn this particular specialty.  Let's see.  And the two people in love package will cost you $1,295.  That's before taxes.  $1,295. 
[01:10:00]  Let's see.  And you know that seafood appetizer is like two little shrimp you picked up at Safeway or  something?  Yeah, of course.  Go down a little more there.  Pizza is on the menu for this overnight stay.  Check in for the European package is 2.30 p.m. with the next day checkout at 8.30 a.m.  Holy shit!  You can't even sleep in?  Wait a minute.  2.30 p.m.  And then the next day checkout is 8.30 a.m.  The fuck you get done with that?  Check in for the Jules Verne package. 
[01:10:30]  Cancellation policy.  Well, I'm sure you've got to pay for that.  Medical restrictions.  Non-servant thing you can't dive.  All right.  Diving stuff.  You'll need a doctor's release if you have high blood pressure, chest surgery, things like  that.  All right.  Well, I just wanted to know what else they got.  Like, it just said appetizers.  So you're starving down there?  15% surcharge for single occupants?  He's got whatever food he brings down.  Yeah.  What if you're fucking hungry? 
[01:11:00]  What, like, room service?  Can you call at 2.30 in the morning and say, hey, give me some food?  I need some fucking shit-free food.  They'd probably leave you little snacks down there, I guess.  Those graham crackers and crackers and things.  This is a dump!  Yeah.  I'm fascinated with it.  I want to drill a hole in the side.  Yeah, you guys could go down and stay there for free.  I would love to just go down there with a fucking drill and fucking scuba gear and then  just drill.  Look in the window at the horrified people and just start drilling holes in it. 
[01:11:30]  Fuckers.  Enjoy this.  If something like that happened, all they would really do is pop up 10 feet to the surface.  It wouldn't be that.  Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be that tragic.  It's disappointing.  We should have a cooler place to hang by now underwater.  It certainly should be.  All right, Megan.  Thank you.  Thank you again.  Thanks.  You guys pretty much made my day when I heard you asking for me on the replay.  Oh, good.  Well, we're glad you're still listening out there.  I'm fascinated with this dumb place. 
[01:12:00]  All right, Megan.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Bye.  Someone knows how the exhaust works, and then we'll move on.  James in Chicago.  James.  Hey, Ant.  You know, here at EGC, so there's always an intake and exhaust, so there has to be makeup  there to keep the pressure.  Otherwise, just an exhaust fan with an airlock would make negative pressure in there anyway.  Yeah.  And then they'd have to deal with that.  Even if there wasn't airlock, they'd have to circulate air to be able to ventilate it  and to keep fresh oxygen down there anyway. 
[01:12:30]  So there must be something like that.  You got a point.  And this guy knows because he's calling us from underwater.  Yeah, I know.  You hear his phone sounds like he's in that shithole hotel.  Wow.  Yeah, okay, all right.  So they're pumping air in, pumping it out, keeping positive pressure.  There goes James.  Yeah, all right.  That makes sense.  And a little observation, and I see that you cleaned up.  Oh, yeah.  I was talking to Obi about this.  You ever just go through a day or two where you just give up on life? 
[01:13:00]  Not give up on life where you're going to kill yourself, Brandon.  I think it's more you give up on hygiene.  You give up on the routine of your life, which includes getting up, shaving, showering, changing,  just doing everything you do every fucking day that just gets annoying.  And sometimes you just give up and bask in your own fucking filth for a day or two. 
[01:13:30]  Your own smells.  I was just, I was there yesterday.  I just reached the point.  I think Ronnie even brought it up.  On the drive home, I heard Ronnie saying something like, yeah, what's Anthony not shaving because  of the Yankee thing?  What's he like, a black girl?  Like, is that a superstition thing and not shaving?  No, I just gave up.  I was like, fuck it.  And then I had every good intention of, like, showering yesterday.  And then I'm sitting on my couch.  No one's at my house.  Obviously.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  I could figure that one out.  Oh, yeah.  So I'm just sitting there.  When you start going to beer, I'm like, okay.  Yeah.  He's got a few days of downtime where he's just hanging by himself.  Ant alone.  Right.  It's so obvious.  You're so easy to read.  I'm sitting on the couch and I'm just fucking playing online poker, watching TV, going,  you know, why fucking bother?  Going upstairs, shaving, all that stuff.  So when I got home yesterday, and I've been staying up, like, ridiculous late hours and  sleeping really late when I get home. 
[01:14:30]  So I got home yesterday, and it was about noon-ish, I guess.  We put in a little OT yesterday.  We sure did.  Entertain our fucking audience.  Watch what we do today.  Yeah, exactly.  We set up a nice early day for ourselves today.  So I drive home, right to bed.  I slept from noon yesterday after the show till 8.30.  8.30 at night when I then turned on the game.  Did you miss some of the games? 
[01:15:00]  I missed the very beginning of the game.  Because you were still sleeping.  I was sleeping.  Why don't you set your alarm?  Just in case.  I didn't give a shit about sleeping till 8.30 at night.  The weather sucked ass.  There was nothing to do.  No one's around, and I'm fucking basking in my own filth.  It was perfect.  So I just, like, laid there, woke up at 8.30, watched the game, and then when the game  was over, I go upstairs, and I just, I was like, I have to do something.  So it took me, I swear to you, over an hour to shave and just wash. 
[01:15:30]  You ever do the shampoo your hair thing where you can't even work up a lather for two rounds  of shampooing?  Jesus.  Where it's just grease in your hair?  You gotta do a double dip.  And the shaving took forever.  And then, you know, you reach a point, gentlemen, where you're worrying about, like, clipping  ear hairs and nose hairs.  I don't like nose hairs. 
[01:16:00]  And, like, eyebrows and ear.  So I make sure all that shit comes off and everything.  So it just took forever for me to get basic hygiene done yesterday.  I went through a set of batteries in my razor, my electric razor.  I had to go downstairs, fucking balls hanging out to get AA batteries.  Do you got an old school electric razor with the three things?  No, I got one of the new ones.  No, no, no, the Norelco one.  No, I got a new one that works really good.  Micro. 
[01:16:30]  I don't use a blade.  You got the disposable fucking electric fucking razor thing yet?  No, I got the one you snap that fucking head off and you brush a little off of there  and you snap it back on.  No.  What?  You know the disposable razors?  Yeah.  Now they come with, like, a battery.  You put a battery in them.  I don't like a blade, though.  And then it fucking vibrates and, man, that motherfucker does the job.  What's the company that makes those?  Do you put it under your glands?  On your dick?  Oh, yeah.  On your glands?  I shave everything.  Shave everything.  That is called the glands. 
[01:17:00]  No, I don't shave everything, but you got to keep things nice.  No, I needed to go two separate razors yesterday.  I reached the point where I needed the clippers, the, like, little clipper things that people  use to shape their ears and things.  Yeah, I understand that.  I had to use that to get the big hairs off.  Right.  And then use the electric one.  That's how bad I had fucking left.  I was fucking Howard Hughes-ing it.  Yeah, you were.  I was that fucking bad.  I think it's, I think it might be the Gillette.  This fucking disposable. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, look at that thing.  Oh, no, that's a little different, but it's the same, it's the same idea.  You know, you got the replacement blades.  It's got five blades.  Yeah, it's got five blades and a battery.  So the whole thing just fucking vibrates.  It makes shaving so easy.  That's very scary.  Dude, it does the job, really.  Does it cut you up, though?  No, not at all.  Not at all.  Is that what you use, Sam?  Yes, it is.  Because I used to go-  Well, you get razor bumps, so shut up.  Yeah, you're-  It's because of your heritage.  Yeah, right.  Coarse hair.  It's your heritage.  Grown men are talking, Sam.  Grown men are talking.  Yeah.  I'm a big boy. 
[01:18:00]  Grown men are talking.  Yeah.  Patrice O'Neill has entered the studio.  The adults are talking now.  What's up, Patrice?  How you doing, Patrice?  What kind of razor blade do you use?  What kind of, like, shaver do you use?  You hear these new ones that-  Hair clippers.  I don't use-  Yeah, see?  I can't use-  Yeah, hair clippers.  I don't use a blade either.  Yeah.  What, an old school-  It's like an electric razor.  An old school electric razor?  The kind-  The kind that you get-  Help us out.  Go and get a haircut with. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, a little trimmer.  Tripp, there's a-  Trimmer.  What, the big fucking blade?  It just goes into, uh, automatically racial, but it has to be.  I try to, you know, try to wait till later.  I know, but-  We can't even talk about fucking shaving without it being racist.  It is what it is.  It's just, it is what it is.  Everyone knows that, yeah.  Black people get the hair bumps if you go too close.  Yeah, but if we say that, it's racist.  It's true, right?  The hair's happening.  The hair grows inside if you don't-  Yeah, you get ingrown hairs. 
[01:19:00]  You get close with a razor, though, with an electric razor.  That's pretty good.  Well, you don't use one thing that we use, which is-  Well, some white guys might, but it's the line to line your shit up.  So, I use the thing that you line your hair up to shave my face.  You gotta do it every other day, but I don't get bumps.  It's very close.  Yeah, that's good.  You don't get bumps.  I don't use a blade.  I don't like fucking blades.  There's the razor right there.  Fuck that thing.  What's it called?  I wanna turn some of the guys on to this if they haven't heard of this yet. 
[01:19:30]  Well, that's the Mach 3 power, and then the one with the one more blade is the fusion  power, but Gillette makes both of them.  Wow.  Mach 3 was good enough for me, I think.  Or maybe I'm using fusion.  I don't even know.  You gotta get the fusion.  Check it out, guys.  If you haven't seen this thing yet, it's a lousy AAA battery, which lasts for fuck it  ever, and then the blades themselves are disposable, but they give you five with the razor.  I was just talking about how, especially when you're, well, only, when you're alone in 
[01:20:00]  your house, and you know no chicks coming over or anything for a few days or anything  like that, like, I just had given up on the routine of, like, hygiene.  You ever just fucking lay in your own filth, and you're just like, fuck it, I'm not gonna  shave, I don't care.  And yesterday, it took me like an hour to get myself back in order.  It was that fucking, like, bad.  But I had to look at myself in the mirror and just go, you fucking animal, get in there  and do some work and clean your ass up. 
[01:20:30]  I've done week-long experiments.  Week-long experiments, right?  Experimentations.  Same draws, same jerk-off draws, same hair, no hair.  You go to bed, and you put your head on the pillow, and then you interlock your fingers  behind your head, and you just go, oh my god, I fucker.  You just laugh at how much you stink.  Like, that you're fucking just in your own filth.  You ever get a whiff of your own ball bag after you haven't showered for four or five  days, and you go, oh, that smell is not coming from me right now. 
[01:21:00]  You know what it is, though?  And the truth of the matter is, and I don't care if people could lie about it, though,  you don't give a shit about your own stench.  You just don't care.  No, no, no.  You can appreciate how bad it is and go, wow, that must really be bad.  It could get to a point where you're kind of embarrassed, even though you're the only  person in the room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're exactly right.  I'm fucked.  When you're pulling the covers up over your shoulders, and that breeze comes up out of  the covers and just picks up stink. 
[01:21:30]  I've smelled like the porno store before.  Like, I've gone that long and just had that much just mess.  Just a mess.  Just stinking.  Sometimes you just don't want to, you want to break the routine of just, I do this every  fucking day.  Just, I'm going to take off for myself.  I'm going to take a few days off.  I'm calling in sick from myself.  That makes sense.  Dang it, just fucking watch TV.  Underarms never stink, though.  Hmm?  My underarms never, I think I've destroyed, like I've clogged up my underarm, I've done so 
[01:22:00]  much chemicals in the mouth that it'll take years for there to be a smell coming from my  underarms.  You ever destroy your own t-shirts?  On what level?  Just like, because what Ant's talking about.  Oh, like you get a white t-shirt that turns yellow under the arm.  Yeah, you blow off the yoder and stuff for a while, and you're fucking, and then you're  looking.  It's fun to do, man.  You just destroy your t-shirts.  Fucking Guinea olive oil coming out of me.  Fuck it, I'm not going to wash.  Fuck it.  All right.  I ain't no one coming over. 
[01:22:30]  I didn't give a shit.  That's all right.  Patrice in studio.  Let's go to Bob in Philly.  Bob?  Hey there, Bab.  No, it's Bob, you silly goose.  Oh, Bob.  Whatever.  Anthony, I just wanted to check in and see how your pussy's feeling after that ass-whooping  of a homecoming dance rape last night.  Oh, shit.  What do you think?  I'm going to sit here and try to talk smack about the game last night?  Your fucking pitcher, Bruce Lee, was fucking fantastic.  He shut down the Yankees. 
[01:23:00]  He did the entire game, pitched every inning.  How many strikeouts did that motherfucker have?  How many strikeouts did that motherfucker have?  He was brilliant.  That one catch he did from the mound where he pitched, the ball was popped up.  He didn't budge, stuck his glove out like Bugs Bunny, and fucking caught the thing.  They're not behind the back bullshit.  That was an amazing play.  I don't know what that was.  The guy was just a fucking...  He was unbelievably good, and he had probably the best... 
[01:23:30]  Like, being in the World Series and pitching like that was probably one of the greatest  moments in his career.  So, more power to him.  What am I going to do?  Talk smack?  Pressure's on.  You guys need a win tonight.  He shut everyone down.  Jeter got a couple of hits off of him.  A-Rod looked like the good old postseason A-Rod we all remember.  Not doing shit.  They didn't really need him in the World Series more than they needed him before now. 
[01:24:00]  Well, that's just it.  So, he can't be going 0 for 3 and 0 for 4 with three strikeouts.  Look, all I know is C.C. Zabavi is fat.  Oh, he's just...  He is a big fat motherfucker.  Just shows you that baseball is barely a sport.  Can I play baseball?  Can I play baseball?  That fat motherfucker?  He looks like one of those old caricatures of a pitcher.  Where he's standing there and the gut's hanging out.  He's just looking to pitch the ball.  Wow.  You know?  He's a big boy.  He is a big motherfucker.  Don't you have to have some type of stamina?  Yeah. 
[01:24:30]  No, you know, the pitcher.  Where you run to first.  You cover first.  You can't do that little jog over to first to cover every so often.  It takes a lot of fucking stamina just to pitch that hard.  I ain't gonna lie.  I'm very happy that the Yankees lost.  Yeah.  Just...  And not because of the Yankees.  There's some guys on the Yankees I enjoy.  I just enjoy when people who...  They just remind me of corporation.  Entitlement.  Yeah.  And I just...  I'm really happy when they lose.  Especially now that they're supposed to...  Nothing could be better.  And I hate baseball.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Nothing could have been better than that three-game comeback.  Just the pain.  Oh, the pain of the Red Sox coming back like that.  I hate fanatical anything.  Fanatical fans.  I know I wasn't fanatical when the Patriots lost when they went 18-0.  And then...  And they lost in the Super Bowl.  If I didn't kill myself, then that means I'm a reasonable human being.  That was the most brutal loss by any franchise.  Losing the Super Bowl.  If they get...  After 18-0?  Oh, yeah.  It doesn't get any worse than that.  I challenge anyone to come up with a worse scenario. 
[01:25:30]  No, that three-game comeback by the Red Sox is beyond...  That's close.  That was crazy.  Not even close to...  That's beyond, beyond pain for the loser of that one.  What about Brady?  He's 18-0, loses the Super Bowl?  They got three Super Bowls under their belt.  This is Boston.  I'm not talking...  All right, but I'm talking the individual years.  Each year after year.  That three-game comeback...  Is worse than the Patriots losing the Super Bowl?  I'm a football fan, a basketball fan.  It's for discussion. 
[01:26:00]  It's the greatest painful thing in the history of life.  It's the only time that has ever happened.  No, I understand all that.  It's unmatched.  But the whole Patriot thing is one in a million, too.  But they went 18-0.  Even no one remembers that anymore.  And it's one game, the Super Bowl.  I mean, it's one fucking game.  When you drop...  I'm not...  That pain.  ...a World Series like that...  Dude, I'm not ready to give up on this argument.  No.  You got an undefeated fucking year, and you lose the Super Bowl.  Your argument is based...  That's fucking brutal, too. 
[01:26:30]  It's just based...  It is...  We're not saying it's not brutal.  You really think...  But there is a pain.  There is a flubbing.  See, the Patriots, they lost that game.  It was a great game.  And...  It was a great game.  That ridiculous catch.  And a couple of times, Eli Manning...  That's...  When Eli Manning first...  When you watch a lot of sports...  When Eli Manning got off of that...  It was one time, they had him.  It was a sack.  Right.  He's a fucking...  He's as bad as his brother in the pocket. 
[01:27:00]  And he got fucking...  He got out of that, threw the ball, and that asshole caught it with his helmet.  That's what made it worse, too.  No one's supposed to catch that fucking ball.  God was against the Patriots.  Well, that's what he said in his book.  But...  More than a catch.  Was it?  Wasn't that the name of his book?  Yes.  More than a catch.  More than a career.  That motherfucker got...  He got cut.  So...  Thanks for nothing, right?  But the three...  Wins him a fucking Super Bowl, you'd think they would let him hang out a little longer.  Goodbye, asshole.  Yeah, even though his skills might not be there, you kind of let the guy...  It's a business. 
[01:27:30]  You kind of let the guy hang out.  You have to be loyal on the artistic end, like the players and anybody who's...  The employee gotta be...  Gotta be fucking...  Have some honor.  Yeah.  Have some loyalty.  But the big bosses, man, it's bottom line, my friend.  Dude, David Tyree won that game for them.  Absolutely.  And they fucking cut his ass.  Plexico, too.  They didn't fight hard for that cocksucker.  He won the game.  They cut his ass.  He won the game.  Plexico.  Hey, people are reminding me.  Thank you.  When I was living in Buffalo at the time, four Super Bowl losses. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, but three...  That's fucking rough, too.  That's a millennium of mediocrity.  They made it, but they just were...  They were the best in a weak division.  And they were a great team, that Buffalo Bills team, but that fought...  You know, look it.  The Norwood Miss, when they were supposed to win.  Oops.  Yeah.  The one that was based on fucking Pet Detective, Ace Ventura.  That was based on that fucking Ace Ventura shit, that fucking Scott Norwood kick, that 
[01:28:30]  dude.  That was painful.  That's up there.  As in pain.  So Wide Wright could be up there with the Red Sox thing.  No.  That could be up there with the Patriots.  Hold on.  Let's work this out.  So you're still seeing Red Sox coming back, number one.  There's nothing fucking worse.  What's number two?  Wide Wright?  Wide Wright?  I only slept like four hours.  Wide Wright?  Number two is fucking 86 Red Sox.  Come on.  Buckner's big.  That Buckner is big, man. 
[01:29:00]  That fucking turned around.  Are you downplaying the fucking Patriots losing the Super Bowl after the end of the season?  I'm not down fucking playing it.  I'm not even just...  It's just not close.  Let's organize this.  I'm not just talking about the Buckner play either.  I'm talking about that whole fucking, like, that whole game.  That was a choke.  They fucking...  They were one strike away.  They fucked that whole...  And then they let the rally start.  If that was just Buckner muffing one thing, that wouldn't have mattered.  Well, that encapsulates the giant meltdown.  That was a giant meltdown. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  And it made that curse.  Yeah, yeah.  And you had a young Roger Clemens.  It hurt.  That was a big...  And some people will say Bucky Dent or whatever.  There's all things.  And I'm trying to be fair and think past just Boston and shit like that.  But that three-game comeback.  Yeah, yeah.  And then you bring up your city.  I remember some of those things.  Because you do remember Hardy.  Because I'm such a hater.  I do embrace when people are just in that kind of fucking pain. 
[01:30:00]  When you have to win one more fucking game.  And, you know, you're 3-0 in the World Series.  And the team comes back and fucks you.  Cleveland last year.  I bet you Cleveland, people in Cleveland, to see LeBron get smashed by Orlando.  The season that Cleveland had last year.  And to lose like they lost to Orlando was probably deflating.  Because Cleveland...  Yeah, but it's not up there.  It's...  See, what are you talking about? 
[01:30:30]  See, it's hard to...  No one expected the Cavaliers to win it all last year.  Yeah, they did.  Yeah.  They're one of the teams that had a shot at it.  You did.  But it wasn't like the Patriots go in fucking 18 and...  Where did they go?  18 and 0, right?  18 and 0.  Dude, it's big.  It's up there.  But I don't even think it's in the top five.  It's not up there like Bill Buckner up there.  Wide right up there.  No.  I don't think it's in the top five.  What?  What the Cavaliers think?  No.  Yeah.  The Patriots.  Wow.  Come on.  I don't think it's in the top five.  Why do you walk away knowing you fucking were 18 and 0 and you lost the Super Bowl? 
[01:31:00]  Well, hold on.  When was this list made?  Because there isn't even...  Oh, this is a list of the most painful...  25 biggest chokes and the Yankees aren't even on that fucking list?  Thank you.  Stop it.  Thank you.  What?  The three games?  Yeah.  That's number one.  That's fucking right up there.  Hold on.  That's what the list should be named.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before you read the list, John in New Hampshire reminds us all of something.  too, as far as the Patriots thing goes.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right.  Hey, yeah, man.  I'll tell you what was worse than Brady losing the Super Bowl. 
[01:31:30]  It's coming back the next year.  Playing what?  One quarter?  Not even?  And going down?  For the season?  There goes your season.  You know, you're hoping after an undefeated season that maybe they can make another run  at it.  You don't make...  I don't think you make enough money for...  They still went 11-5 and didn't make...  That next season was such a great season for football.  They went 11-5 and still didn't make the playoffs.  So they could have won 11-5 with Tom Brady and still didn't make the fucking playoffs.  Yeah, but the problem is not knowing. 
[01:32:00]  Very true.  There's Brady going 18-0, losing the Super Bowl, so now all he wants to do is come back  the next year and he's down in the first fucking game, season-ending injury.  That would never be up there.  That wouldn't even be close.  I'm just saying that's got to be brutal for him.  I don't care.  I mean, that's worse than the 18-0, and I think Patrice has it, though.  The Yankees up 3-0, man.  Yeah.  Come back.  Food 4-0.  That's got to be the worst.  That's crushing.  And it ended...  All right.  And it ended some magical shit.  It seemed like it...  Okay, at the time, it was the Babe...  The Babe... 
[01:32:30]  The Curse of the Babe, right?  Yeah.  Only that kind of comeback could make...  That comeback made people go...  You haven't heard the Curse of the Bambino ever again.  Yeah.  Because that had to be what happened.  Yeah.  Because if the Red Sox had to got lucky and won, people would have been like, uh, you know,  we'll do it next year.  People don't feel that anymore.  That...  Yeah, that's done.  It's dead.  Yeah.  A lot of people agreeing with you.  It's got to be said.  Yeah.  Let me throw this... 
[01:33:00]  I don't know...  Well, let's just go to Mark in Houston, and I'll explain.  Go ahead, Mark.  Because I don't like baseball.  Go ahead, Mark.  Yeah.  The Oilers were up, like, 40 points at halftime in the loss against Buffalo.  And you mention that to anybody in Houston, and you...  And, like, I get physically ill thinking about that.  That was...  I mean, it was horrific.  For people that have never seen that game, get a copy.  First of all, and people don't even realize that it was Frank Reich, not Jim Kelly.  And it was Warren Moon that was playing.  Backup quarterback against Warren Moon. 
[01:33:30]  They're down how many points at halftime?  Was it 40?  30-something.  30-something, and...  Oh, shit.  It was 35-3.  It was like 35 or 40.  Have you ever seen this game, Ant?  No.  And people forget.  They really just assume it was Kelly coming back.  No, Kelly fucking wasn't in the game.  It was Frank Reich who barely played, and he brought the team back against Warren Moon in  the second half.  Wow.  And some...  You want to talk about magical.  Something magical was happening that day in Buffalo.  It was fucked up.  Everyone knew early on in the second half they were going to win this game.  You just knew. 
[01:34:00]  There was just something in the air.  I think you got it all...  As a long-time Oiler fan, I can tell you, we knew it.  I mean, that's what they always did.  So, I mean, you know, we weren't almost not surprised.  Yeah, the announcers were even getting excited, like, oh, my God, we're all going to experience  something here.  Just everyone knew it.  It was the weirdest thing that day.  Well, thanks a lot, and happy birthday, Patrice.  All right, Mark.  I remember that game like it was yesterday.  Timmy's not here.  I think that also you have to... 
[01:34:30]  Something that you can't watch.  Now, there's no way that somebody who's a Yankees fan could watch any game that had  to do with that three-game team.  No, no.  I can't watch the 18-0 Super Bowl.  I can't watch it.  Maybe I was affected by it.  Yeah.  It was emotional.  Maybe it was so disturbing that it was like, you know, like you've been raped and then don't  remember or touch funny as a kid.  But I can't watch Christian Leighton's turnaround jump shot to beat Kentucky. 
[01:35:00]  I can't watch...  College basketball, yeah.  I close my eyes and turn the TV off when I see that.  I hope he misses every time and I still see it.  Full court pass, grabs it at the foul line, turns and shoots.  Right?  That's the play, right?  He does a fake.  I can't watch that personally.  That was not supposed to happen.  I can watch...  It just wasn't supposed to happen.  I can watch Bill Buckner.  I know there's people that can't watch Bill Buckner.  They just can't. 
[01:35:30]  They're on the back.  Oh!  But I can't think of anybody.  I'm trying to think of...  It's so unfair, this Northeast thing.  I know there's a lot of pain.  I was in Canada and they said there was something...  There was a hockey game that no one in Canada can watch.  Like the Canadians did something.  Fuck, I don't know.  And they can't...  Or the Edmonton Oilers or something.  They can't fucking watch.  There's some things you just go, oh God.  Yeah, I don't know.  I can't watch any clips from last night's game.  It's annoying the shit that all they're doing is playing these highlights from last night's game. 
[01:36:00]  You weren't supposed to win that game last night, though.  It was just one of those games.  You gotta come back tonight now.  Cliff...  Go Cliff...  Lee on the mound.  I've never...  I've...  It's amazing.  What'd you say when I came in this morning?  You said that?  He's supposed to be that good?  No, this guy was...  And not only that, he was cocky and fucking like smug.  He made play...  He made these...  He made a catch where he throws...  He pitches.  The ball gets popped up to the mound. 
[01:36:30]  And he just stands there like this.  And goes...  Bunk!  Puts his glove out and like, yeah, it's in my glove.  And everyone started laughing because it was so non-show on.  I don't think you're paying attention because you're not...  You're a Yankees fan.  Yeah.  But are you a baseball fan?  Meaning...  Oh, I understand what you're saying.  No, I wouldn't be able to tell you all the people on the Phillies.  I'm not a...  Again, I reiterate.  When things transcend past you're giving a fuck level, you're a meter, I know that 
[01:37:00]  Philly...  People are not...  Philly is as good as the Yankees.  Oh, yeah.  And the only thing they're saying is maybe the pitching.  Their pitchers are great for Philly, but they haven't been great lately.  So they could end up being great during this thing.  I understand.  These fuckers are good from top to bottom.  And I don't give a fuck.  I understand that the Phillies are a good team.  It's not like I'm like, oh, who are these guys coming in?  I understand.  They've got a great year. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, and they're pitching.  They're beasts!  But the way he pitched last night was not...  Like, you will not see pitchers every night getting up and fucking playing like that.  That was a ridiculous fucking night he had.  When I came in, you said they shouldn't allow robots to be...  Robots to fucking play in the World Series.  Back in the World Series, he pitched like a robot.  They're just not afraid.  And Rollins said, he said, we're going to beat him in five, and if we're feeling charitable, 
[01:38:00]  we'll beat him in six.  Oof.  And he said it, and it was so funny.  It wasn't like some ridiculous trying to get confidence shit.  Behind him, catch.  Your team's in trouble, Ant.  They got to win tonight.  Yeah, caught it.  All right, listen, let's move on.  Oh, they do have to win tonight.  So let's do the biggest chokes in sports history.  What website is this from?  List after list dot com.  Oh, whatever.  So it's going to be a horse shit list.  What do you want to do here?  Top ten?  Eh, ten.  I can't see from here. 
[01:38:30]  Patrice, you got the list in front of you?  It's O'Brien fails to qualify for Olympics is ten.  Are you going?  Okay.  What the hell is that?  I got you there.  Go.  You're on.  You're on over there.  O'Brien, that was the...  What?  He was the DeCastley, right?  Oh, Dan O'Brien?  Oh, see, this is the chokes.  Yeah, we could go...  You got to go top upset, top pain.  Like, this is...  Like, no one gives a fuck about Dan O'Brien.  No.  And the reason anybody would care...  You remember what happened? 
[01:39:00]  They had those fucking...  Hold on, hold on.  Keep it there for a second.  Yeah.  Those big...  Those big...  He was...  They were pumping him up.  Madison Avenue.  Madison Avenue cared about Dan O'Brien.  You know, sports fans didn't give a shit.  Nobody cared.  By the way, as far as this list goes, the biggest chokes in sports history.  Bill Buckner is number one.  And number two is that Oilers game we were just talking about for the 1992 NFL playoffs.  Oh, Chris Webber.  Chris Webber fucking choked.  1993 NCAA championship. 
[01:39:30]  I can't watch that one either.  God damn.  That was the Fab Five, and I loved the Fab Five.  Bad one?  That was sad.  And he called the timeout, I think.  Right, Patrice?  He called the timeout.  And they didn't have any more timeouts left.  Which was not his fault.  It was...  The coach has to say, we have no timeouts.  Yeah.  If you call one, we're going to get a tech.  He didn't know that.  It was painful.  Yeah, it was painful.  It was really bad.  Jean-Claude Van Damme.  What?  Oh, Jean...  No, I can never say his name.  This was classic for golf fans.  Jean Van Damme.  Jean Van Damme. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, he was way up in the British Open and just completely choked on the last hole.  Fell apart.  Ended up in the water, and he took his shoes and his fucking socks off and hit it off the  grandstands.  Somebody help me out.  How many stroke lead did he have going into the...  He was up six strokes.  No.  Yes.  Going into the last hole?  Yes.  Going into the last hole.  Okay.  Last hole.  I didn't realize it was that bad.  Oh, yeah.  He was up six strokes, Anthony.  Yeah.  Can we find the video?  It's hilarious.  It's so sick. 
[01:40:30]  And just like, you know...  Danny would have found it, by the way, Sam.  Danny would have found it.  Huh?  No, he would have found the clip.  You know what?  We're talking about a bunch of sports clips here.  Let me just bring this up, Sam.  Patrice has mentioned a couple that were tragic, you know, that Opie had mentioned a couple  of these plays that are amazing.  Danny would have had them up there for us to watch and go, yeah, that was it.  Holy shit.  You are...  What are you looking at?  Porno?  No, he said to leave the list.  You kept the list up forever.  No, Danny would have minimized the list and then hit us with the videos. 
[01:41:00]  I bet you if we were talking about great wrestling moments, you would have had the  clips ready to go.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Please.  That's what he's going to add on the list.  Hey, Hulk Hogan loses to King Kong Bunny at WrestleMania 7.  Right.  Anthony, Kevin from Connecticut writes, hoping you're thinking about the movie Happy Gilmore.  No.  That Happy Gilmore thing actually happened at the British Open in what year?  1993.  Wow, that's brutal.  You've got to see that.  Six strokes is the last hole.  No.  I didn't realize it was six.  I'm never going to see it either, by the way.  I thought it was three, maybe four. 
[01:41:30]  I did not realize it was six.  He hit it out of bounds off the grandstands.  He fucking was in the water up against rocks.  He just folded.  And everyone's like, what the fuck is going on?  Why don't you copy-paste the guy's name from the list instead of Greg Norman being there?  Oh, boy.  Are you panicking, Sam?  Yeah.  Copy-paste.  You force him to do something.  There you go.  Yeah, because this guy's not going to have a lot of videos.  There's going to be one video for this guy.  There we go.  His collapse.  Golf collapse.  It's easy.  Here's the...  See, Sam? 
[01:42:00]  All right.  I mean, there's no easy tee shot, I think.  He's probably still suffering, this guy.  Oh, yeah.  He was British Open, too, man.  One of the majors.  He's got...  All he has to do is fucking...  If he gets a triple bogey, he still wins.  Triple bogey, he wins, yeah.  Here's his drive on the 18th hole.  As many as six.  As many as six.  A brave choice, don't you know?  What a fucking wanker. 
[01:42:30]  So the drive was even okay, right?  Yeah.  What is he, dunk it in the water?  No way.  Watch this.  I love this.  Come on, it's so fast.  The drive was even okay, considering he was six strokes ahead.  This is douchey.  Why don't you maximize the screen a little bit there?  You got it.  Thank you.  That's quick.  And then pitch it on the green and ripot it or ripot it and walk off with it.  He's looking over a little water hat.  It's like a little fucking puddle in front of him, by the way. 
[01:43:00]  Here's his second shot.  Up by six shots to when the British Open.  Can you watch this?  It was here that the tragicomedy began.  The tragicomedy.  The result from the ricochet was unfortunate, to say the least.  I didn't need to go for glory.  That wasn't something absolute.  Can you stop that for a second?  This is absolutely why.  I've traveled, right?  This is absolutely why.  Fucking America, no matter how awful it is, is still the best. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  We know how to make drama.  Yeah.  Like, other people don't appreciate drama.  They go like, oops, here's where the tragic comedy.  It's like somebody would go, oh, this motherfucker is falling apart.  Yeah.  You dirty rotten piece of shit.  We're watching this guy destroy himself here.  He's like, oh, that's unfortunate.  And they're letting him, the interview, they're allowing this guy to just go, yeah, to brush  it off like it ain't the worst thing that's ever happened in history. 
[01:44:00]  The most horrible thing.  People are saying, Travis, he was only three strokes ahead, not six.  I just heard him say.  That's fine.  Whatever.  You know, Sports Illustrated says one thing.  I heard him say, I heard the announcer there say he's got six chances here.  I think he just has to get a six on the last hole.  No, no, I think.  All right, let's find out.  So then his second shot is in deep fucking, you don't get out of it, type grass, rough  shit.  He's in some fucking rough shit.  The jungle.  Surely good sense screened for a chop out chip and two putts. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  Chop out chip and two putts.  If the neurons are pounding the misfiring, the humor from here is all gallows or more appropriately  guillotine.  As high up as it goes.  All right, here's his third shot.  No, his hopes would sink in it.  Watch this.  All he has to do is chip this out of the deep grass.  It went into the water.  Now he's looking very depressed.  The people are laughing. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, shit.  People are laughing at him.  This guy is having the worst.  You are watching a man having the worst day of his life.  See, most people don't give a shit about golf, unfortunately.  He's playing sports fans.  He's adding jazz.  Spanish guitar.  Yeah.  But let's be honest.  This could be the greatest collapse right here.  Now he's in the water without shoes and socks.  Shoes and socks off.  He's in the water.  His ball is there.  Now he's got a hit from about four inches of water. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  How does he fucking even think he's going to do this?  That must be his wife just pussy drying up.  Yeah.  Pussy drying up.  I think he...  What did he do?  I think he just...  He's taking a penalty because he can't hit it out of the water.  His wife's embarrassed.  That's his wife.  He's got to be.  Wait.  He's playing from the water.  Vandervelde dropped into more trouble.  Now he has to drop into more shit.  Vandervelde was now making his own contribution to the Tartan cause.  Paddy looked on bemused. 
[01:46:00]  Oh my God.  This guy fell apart.  And now he's got another shitty shot from the rough because he had to take it out of  the water and take a penalty.  And now...  In the sand trap.  He just went in the sand trap.  This guy's fucking...  Vandervelde had to fall from sand to secure a French tram.  The crowd disbelieving and sympathetic.  We're watching one of the most dramatic...  Oh, he had a face like I should beat him.  I should have stopped beating myself in the head with one of these clubs. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Oh, this poor fuck.  Now he's got a hole out?  Paddy planned a glorious climax to follow the gore of his miserable back nine.  Paddy was the guy he was obviously playing with.  Oh, shit.  And Paddy puts it in from the sand trap.  That's the guy who he was playing against.  He just put it in from a sand trap. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  And now...  Oh my God.  And now...  Vandervelde had to emulate the Australian.  He had to just do the same thing.  Chip it out and get it in.  Chip it in from the sand, yeah.  Can he tie after?  I don't remember anymore.  We'll find out in a second.  It's been a long time that I've even thought about this.  So now he chips out of the sand.  And he's about...  Now a playoff was assured.  Leonard hadn't expected a second chance.  Lordy had been ten shots back at the start of the game. 
[01:47:30]  He lost a ten-shot lead.  He's got to putt this in for a playoff.  Right.  Where is he?  About four feet away from the pen?  Four or five feet.  Four feet away from the cup.  For the tie and the playoff.  Right.  Here he goes.  And here's the putt.  The putt.  So he makes the putt and then...  There were three men in a four-hole aggregate playoff.  And then he goes to the playoff and loses in the playoff.  He threw his shit.  Did you see him throw his club?  Dude.  He was very angry. 
[01:48:00]  It is a massive collapse.  British Open, 1993.  Look up the video.  Has he won anything since?  Did he play again?  It took him seven years to win another major tournament.  Yeah.  That was it for him.  Oh.  That was it.  It's an amazing piece of sports fucking footage.  For him, that's probably number one.  Yeah, yeah.  I think for a lot of people.  But unfortunately, golf's not as big as these other sports.  Yeah.  Choking in golf, to me, is amazing.  You can only choke in golf after you've been playing amazing. 
[01:48:30]  Like, to hit that ball in that little hole and then you go...  That's not choking.  No.  That's like choking at darts.  Like, all you had to do was get the bullseye to win.  Yeah.  But he couldn't do...  Like, get the fuck out of here.  Hobbies don't count.  I was on a dart league, though.  I did choke a few times.  No, you don't get to say choke.  Very good.  And just, there's a little more info on what we just...  Long Island.  It's mandatory.  There's a little more info on what we just saw.  Dave in Westchester. 
[01:49:00]  Dave.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  So, two things about that Vanderbilt choke.  Two weeks later, somebody...  He had made a comment that said,  geez, I could have made six with my putter on that hole  to win the tournament and hide the whole last one.  Two weeks later, on a bet, he went to the same hole  and made six play in the hole with just his putter.  That was a little too much pressure for him.  Here's the worst part about this whole thing.  If you look, the guy who writes the name on the trophy 
[01:49:30]  for the British Open already had half of Vanderbilt's name  on the trophy.  So, if you won the tournament,  you can still faintly see Vanderbilt's name underneath  because they had half of it already carved into the trophy.  Yeah, so they had to rub that out and put the...  I don't even remember who won it that year,  to be honest with you.  I think it was Paul Laurie.  Okay, yeah.  But there you go.  Thank you for that info, Dave.  I appreciate it. 
[01:50:00]  Dave from Westchester.  We should take a break, but there you go.  Patrice O'Neal.  Are you promoting anything, Patrice?  Yeah, where are you going to be?  Where are you going to be at?  Where were you off to the last time you were here?  Did it go well?  Oh, yeah, it went pretty good.  Bananas, right?  Poughkeepsie, and I'll be a couple of places  coming up my last few performances of the year  before the holidays.  You take the rest of the year off, do you?  And I just...  Mellow out.  And I'm going to put on my answer machine,  2009's going to be my year. 
[01:50:30]  But it is 2009.  Yeah, as soon as 2010 comes.  I swear to God, every gig I took this year,  I said, I'm not taking because I'm going to get something.  Yeah.  If I didn't, I'd be a homeless mother.  I'd be sleeping in this studio.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  So I've got a few things.  Stress Factory coming up.  Yeah, all right.  Bananas and...  We'll figure it out.  All that shit.  Hey, we've got to take a break.  This show's going to go by fast today  because we've got Laszlo coming in today.  And we're leaving early.  Hopefully we'll leave early. 
[01:51:00]  Bill Donahue's calling in about the Curb Your Enthusiasm thing.  We'll ask Patrice if he's seen the episode.  If he hasn't, we'll explain it to Patrice.  Bill Donahue's outraged,  and he wants to talk to us today.  And you want to squeeze in a Jocktober today, Ed?  I would love to.  Remember, we can't squeeze it in.  It cannot be dismissed.  It must be played.  We're pretty much done with Jocktober.  Tomorrow's the last day.  Yeah.  That sucks.  And Sam picked out a show fave for today's Jocktober.  Today's a very special Jocktober. 
[01:51:30]  Yes, it is.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to bring back a lot of memories.  Oh, cool.  Two guys just like you and I, my friend.  Really?  Just like you and I.  Just two guys.  Just two guys.  Yeah.  You'd think they were married, though.  Oh, boy.  All right, we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony and Patrice O'Neal.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neal sitting in for Jim Norton.  Jimmy's going to be on Leno tonight.  Oh.  So, please watch Jimmy on Leno tonight.  I know a lot of you are going to be watching the World Series, but you know what? 
[01:52:00]  Take a peek and then go back to the game.  Oh, yeah?  At the very least, take a peek and watch Jimmy's segment tonight.  He's doing uninvited guests.  So, those things are just kicking ass, especially for Jay Leno.  Patrice O'Neal is going to be at Bananas Comedy Club in Hasbro Heights this time around.  Oh, this is down the road, Patrice.  All right.  You know what?  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  And Patrice will be telling you where he's going to be at.  That's what you should do.  Go to Big Mama Prods on Twitter. 
[01:52:30]  And I saw your tweet about the Vikings-Steelers game.  Oof.  Fucking it.  That was the game of the week, though, right?  Oof.  You liked?  Oof.  Maybe we shouldn't talk about it.  No.  It was four days ago, right?  But I'm just saying, can I just say that Adrian Peterson was an animal.  Is that his name?  I think it's not.  I don't know.  For the Vikings, the running back?  Yeah.  Oof.  I'd never, I just was relaxed.  I had to let some kind of emotion out. 
[01:53:00]  When I saw that fucking animal hit that dude gay.  His last name was gay.  Gay.  And knocked him straight.  Yeah.  But the sadness is, you see that little simple thing?  They couldn't even say that on SportsCenter ever.  Like, nowhere could a dude just get that pain out of going, he straightened gay up.  Couldn't even say that.  He hit this guy in the mouth.  I've never, this guy is a fucking animal, dude. 
[01:53:30]  He's the baddest motherfucker.  And I'm telling you, clips love football.  I've never seen a clip, the only clip close to that, close, is Earl Campbell hitting a motherfucker  in his chest.  Earl Campbell has a clip like that.  This will go down as one of the greatest all-time offensive fucking blows ever.  However, he hit this guy in his foot, his feet fell off the ground.  Well, maybe we'll see.  Oh, wow.  Earl Campbell's hit is one of the greatest of all time. 
[01:54:00]  When he put his, he put his leg up.  This ain't it.  Here it is.  Wait, no.  Here it is.  Boom!  Oh!  That's number one.  But Adrian Peterson hitting gay in his mouth is number two.  Hitting gay in his mouth.  Is that clip anywhere?  Oh, if you can see it, it shook my bones, man.  That was a great game.  Oh, my God.  What a game.  What a fucking game, man.  I have to say Adrian Peterson.  I have to say that dude, man. 
[01:54:30]  We get to see somebody that's going to, you know.  We're talking sports a lot.  That means it's a good sports year or something.  Because we don't talk sports this much, usually.  It's the greatest time I've ever heard of this.  Boom!  That guy's name is gay.  Boy, he didn't.  Did you see what he did with his legs after he hit the ground?  I think he still thought he was on the ground.  Look at his leg.  And then he just stepped over him.  He walked on top of him.  He stepped on his chest. 
[01:55:00]  Did you see gay?  It's just monstrous, dude.  Gay's like pedaling like he's on a bike.  He doesn't know where he is.  Like a bull, he went over the sky.  It's just, you don't understand that that don't happen.  And gay didn't understand it.  That, like, everyone's, if you want, you just know that that doesn't happen ever.  Oh, look at him.  It was, it was, I wanted to cry.  He's laying there with his legs flailing around.  And I wrote on Twitter that I wanted to get my girl pregnant.  Oh, and I couldn't finish it. 
[01:55:30]  She knows I'm 100%.  But I said I wanted to fuck my girl, get her pregnant.  So I could have a son.  So I could have him do things like that to other men.  Just, I can't do that to other men.  I'm fucking 40.  But that fucking, just to have a son.  Can you imagine how proud you are as a father?  Oh, wow.  That guy got laid out.  That guy ain't moving.  That fucking guy ain't moving.  What happened to him?  Oh.  Yeah.  That's going to hurt.  That was a high hit.  I just wanted to say that that was just, let's talk about that Twitter.  What a fucking, oh, that hit. 
[01:56:00]  Someone's saying check out the Eagles hit on Reggie Brown 2006.  Oh.  We're talking offensive.  Less than three.  Thank you.  Offensive player versus a defensive player.  You won't.  You'll see all kinds of shit.  The Steelers fans are yelling and screaming that Peterson didn't even get 70 yards that  day.  Or he got about 70 yards fucking rushing.  Who gives a fuck?  I give a nigga credit.  I hear it.  He destroyed that guy.  What are we looking at to you?  All Burns, Junior, Rose, what the fuck?  And George's Reggie Brown.  Let's see.  Let's see.  Let's see this hit. 
[01:56:30]  No audio?  Wow.  He knocked his fucking head off?  Oh, that was the ball.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, yeah.  He got creamed by two guys.  Yeah.  All right.  That got hurt.  Let's get into some Jocktober.  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to rock.  It's a celebration of hacky, pukey radio shows and DJs from across this great nation of  ours.  Blocking the berries, sweeter than juice, baby.  There was a lot of energy there for some reason, but it's like wasted energy. 
[01:57:00]  It's like sitting in your driveway in neutral and just gassing it.  Strike up the crapola.  It's Jocktober.  There's a person stranded.  There's a show.  There's a show.  It's stranded.  My rebuttal is, yo mama.  I like that.  What the hell was that?  Happy Jocktober, everybody, from your friends at the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ha, ha.  Let's all do it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:57:30]  What?  There was no joy attached to that sound done.  And here we are.  We only have two more days in Jocktober, which really sucks.  I think we're going to continue this bit, but we're going to kind of put it on the side  so we bring it back every once in a while because we can't wait a whole nother year  before we beat up other radio shows.  So with that said, if you've got a good name where we can change the name of this thing  so we can continue doing this, please contact Sam with your names.  Just Twitter me.  Yeah, Twitter Sam. 
[01:58:00]  Not Sam on Twitter, I believe.  You're not Sam?  That's me.  I'm not.  You would know, but you stopped following me.  Oh, that's right, because it was all wrestling shit.  Before we get into Jocktober, that the Twitter, somebody tweeted, I am the real Bobo.  That's the real Bobo.  Yeah, that's the real Bobo.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I didn't think for a second that it wasn't.  Really?  But the person spelled you, Y-U-O.  Yeah, yeah.  And please, P-L-E-Z-E. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, everything's misspelled.  I'm thinking, and something's wrong because everybody's like, dude, that ain't the fucking  real Bobo.  And I'm like.  Wow, this guy's.  Maybe it was such a setup.  This guy is convincing.  It's Bobo.  It's Bobo.  Patrice?  Yeah, yeah.  If you want to reach Bobo on Twitter, just go to twitter.com slash I am the real Bobo.  But he spelled all that right.  Yes.  It says, Patrice, this is Bobo.  Please, P-L-E-Z-E. 
[01:59:00]  Please help me plug my Twitter account.  I think he left something out of account.  Boy, there's two C's.  Yeah.  Had fun Friday.  C-Y-U-O soon.  Also, Friday he spelled F-R-U.  Oh, it's Friday.  Friday.  I didn't see from here.  It's a new day of the week.  Friday.  I'm so stupid to not know.  I'm just dumb.  Yeah.  I'm just fucking dumb.  It would be.  Though, if somebody was faking being him, you would spell stuff like that. 
[01:59:30]  He talks about Joe opening for Joe DeRosa.  Yeah.  First, he spells Joe, J-E-O.  J-E-O.  And then he spells it G-O-E.  G-O-E.  Yes.  Just in case.  He's covering all his bases.  It's got to be him.  I'm just dumb.  That's great.  I'm so fucking stupid.  All right.  So, get a hold of Sam if you've got a new name for Jocktober so we could do it all year  long.  Yes.  That would be nice.  I mean, we're not going to, you know, for like once every maybe two or three weeks.  Yeah.  Don't even worry.  Just here and there type shit.  Yeah.  But today, we got a show that we know very well. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  I think that we shouldn't fully announce the show because most of our listeners know  them.  We spent a lot of time with them.  We just haven't talked about them in a year.  Wow.  So, I feel like maybe before you even announce what the show is, you should play like one  of their sweepers.  Track one.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll introduce today's Jocktober with this.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  With oh, shit.  Let's see.  Who is it?  Come on.  Here it is.  No, it's not Ron and Fez.  Shut up.  The John and Jeff Show. 
[02:00:30]  We're two guys who think there is no excuse for poor neighborhoods being dirty.  We're two guys who think any band that comes back after a farewell tour should be sued.  We're two guys who think parole boards should be eliminated.  We're two guys who think children's beauty pageants are comfort food for perverts.  The John and Jeff Show.  The John and Jeff Show.  Ten years long.  Ten years strong.  Oh, ten years long.  Ten years strong.  It's the John and Jeff Show, which you can hear in Boston, Seattle, Portland, Providence, 
[02:01:00]  Norfolk, Greensboro, Louisville, Fresno, Reno, Charleston, Ithaca, Grand Rapids, Lansing,  Fort Wayne, Augusta, Charlottesville, Bloomington, Sioux City, and Junction City on the talk of JC.  Jesus, are you kidding me?  They're the third shifters.  Everybody's favorite.  I know.  They were the overnight show when we were getting ready for our regular radio show on K-Rock. 
[02:01:30]  The Opie and Anthony lead-in.  Yeah, they would be blasting through the hallways this John and Jeff nonsense.  We're two guys who think, yeah.  You always used to dump to them every morning.  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Had a good dump to John and Jeff.  Are they doing anything different since the last time we looked at them?  Definitely.  They are really sort of broadening their horizons.  Well, they're ten years long.  Ten years strong.  Ten years strong.  We're two guys that think and go. 
[02:02:00]  Go.  Yeah, the flights to Thailand for young boys are great.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  So, Patrice.  Patrice.  Dude, this is a guy.  Look at this picture.  Yeah, look at that.  Without even our help, you tell us what you think and your honest opinion is going on in that photo.  So, he was doing a radio show about the Vietnam War.  Yeah.  And he was going back to apologize to some of the mother's daughters. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  He found the daughter of Kim Fuck, who was running after the napalm strike.  He found a daughter.  He found a girl in the sea who goes, what are you, a fucking fag?  What are you, a homosexual?  He found the daughter of the woman that threw the pointy hat in the chopper.  In the pockets now.  He found the coastal casualties of war.  I want you to put a skit up her ass.  Oh, my God. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, my God.  This guy took trips to Thailand, and he's in one of those Thailand-type fucking bars.  This is one of those places where they can shoot darts out of their pussy and pop balloons.  I'm not kidding.  And it looks like he is with a 13-year-old over here.  Well, we can't just say that.  Well, okay.  How do I reiterate so he can't sue me?  He appears to be.  He appears to be.  Something's going on in our humble opinion.  I mean, if I'm in Brazil and you see all my pictures of a giant creep. 
[02:03:30]  Based on that picture, my personal assessment of it is that he was paying her for some type of sexual favor.  Now, what's the word that I used to be accused without?  Allegedly?  It could be your opinion.  In my opinion.  In my personal, humble opinion.  Yeah.  She's not his longtime friend.  No.  She looks very young, too.  Doesn't she look like about 14 years old? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  15 years old?  You don't think he traveled there with her?  I don't fucking know.  And his fake smile looks like he just took his vampire teeth out?  And he's just waiting to put them back in?  He looks like he fits in there perfectly.  Now, let me also tell you something.  He is sitting down.  He is sitting down at the bar.  She is on his lap, on his knee.  His hand is as low as it can go on her bare skin without touching her very, very low-rise jeans. 
[02:04:30]  Right.  Which are about a size fucking negative two.  Yeah.  If they're even jeans, it might be a little skirt or something.  She looks like she's starving.  And there's some alleged hookers on a swing in the back.  Yeah, yeah.  The background's a little blurry.  On auction, by the way.  Now, let me say, there's two girls barely dressed, yeah, on a swing behind him.  If this guy, all he has to do to just be a dude and be cool and have nobody fuck with him  is go, yes, I'm doing what you allegedly think I am doing, and you could never say anything to the fuckers. 
[02:05:00]  Say, at least it ain't a boy, motherfucker.  Yeah.  I'm doing what I do, you cocksucker.  Yeah.  I'm feeding this girl.  What I'm spending, bought this girl new fucking shingles for a shitty cut down.  Shingles.  It's better than just getting a thank you letter from him in the mail after you're sending some cash.  I don't think they got shingles over there.  They might.  Corrugated tin.  I like your joke, but I don't know.  I don't know if they have actual shingles.  I used to bring shingles in a suitcase when I used to go to Brazil. 
[02:05:30]  Currency.  Baby, what you need?  I need shingles.  Well, fucking, I got them.  I go to the Tile City, nigga, and I'm bringing them.  Got some for you?  Yeah.  Apparently, also, they had taken these pictures off of their website.  Yes.  I mean, that could...  Iraq was smart enough to save them.  Sex bagel.  But that could just be that, you know, they're moving on with their website and getting...  Oh, is that it?  It wasn't the fact that we pounded him about it last time?  Well, I would like to think that's the reason. 
[02:06:00]  They, uh...  Well, on the photo section...  Yeah, what do they got now?  They have the trip.  Oh.  Oh, so they still have the trip, but they don't have him with a young fucking, uh...  Guess what?  I have pictures of me at fucking Christos, the giant Jesus.  I also have those pictures, too.  Yeah, look at him.  He's in front of some kind of Pagoda.  Now he's got the normal tourist pictures.  He's at a temple...  Yeah, that's why he's there.  Yeah, that's it.  That's why you go to Thailand.  There's a fucking Pagoda in his pants.  Oh.  I don't even know this guy, but it's like this giant head and no shoulders. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, he's very creepy.  Oh, you know he had a good...  It's either Jeff or John.  I don't know which...  It might be John, but I don't know.  All right, it's Jack Tover.  Let's get into this.  More John and Jeff descriptives.  Anthony Woodges.  What?  Her?  I'm not into Asian girls.  I would probably take a handy or a blowjob from her or something like that, but I'm not  into Asian girls.  Maybe Southeast Asian?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'd have to be...  How much did I drink?  Are you serious?  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  Well, let me see.  You know what?  I've never...  This is one of the things... 
[02:07:00]  You know how much I like Anthony.  Your racism gets in the way of you getting pussy, man.  Your pussy racism is shocking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because even slave owners slept with slaves.  Like, pussy is just so...  Yeah, I don't know how they did that.  I'm very...  But, wait a minute, though.  I'll tell you what.  Yeah.  I think you don't...  I didn't do much reading about it, but you tell me.  You don't hear stories that much of the German guys messing with the Jewish women during  that time. 
[02:07:30]  Well...  I don't hear much of it.  Yeah.  It was some going on, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I think so.  Like, just how they looked and what they did to them, you just didn't think it was no...  But it was so fucking against...  Like, if you got caught having sex with a Jewish woman back then and you were a Nazi,  you were fucked.  You were fucked.  You didn't do that.  Oh, no.  That's shocking about it.  We've talked about this before, but it's usually pussy just...  No.  It just goes across lines. 
[02:08:00]  It has nothing to do with...  Believe it or not, Patrice...  Look at that picture of them.  It has nothing to do with me going, I don't like this race of people, so I don't want  to have sex with their women.  I'm not attracted...  What is it, dead nigga?  I'm not attracted to, like...  You never were attracted to an exotic girl?  To, like, black women.  Like, there are some that are really hot, but they gotta be, like, mocha kind of, like,  tanned white women, black women.  I don't like, like, fucking, you know, hey, white boy, you best fuck me good. 
[02:08:30]  Like, Walmart, big ass fucking...  I get it.  I get that.  I get that.  But you come...  Sometimes you just come off, like, I'm not gonna fuck anybody with that.  Like, you thought because that's a young-looking, skinny chick that I would be all over it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Asians, to me, eh.  Yeah, I'd like to see her naked.  I might, you know, scrap one looking at her little titties or something.  I'm not a giant Asian, like, guy where I flip out.  But, again, I think Nicole Kidman is one of the biggest... 
[02:09:00]  She's not Asian.  But I'm saying, I understand what you're saying.  It's like, for me to like a white girl, she has to be, like, where I go, woo.  Like, Nicole Kidman is one of the biggest publicity stunt beauties I've ever...  I just...  Or Gwyneth Paltrow.  I just...  They just look sickly.  Yeah.  You don't like them.  They look translucent.  Yeah.  Yeah, you pick two that most guys wouldn't be, you know, jumping up and down about.  Dude, I hear people loving Nicole Kidman. 
[02:09:30]  Loving Nicole Kidman.  Come on.  What year is this?  Yeah, yeah.  No, they're...  Not anymore.  I'm just saying.  Her face is frozen.  Get a picture of her.  She did so much work to her face, it's frozen now.  I don't get it.  Look, we got to move on.  I like a pale girl, though.  Okay.  We got to move on because we got Bill Donahue, we got Laszlo, we're going to just run out of time.  So we can pick up this argument, absolutely, a little later.  But find the pictures of Nicole Kidman.  Again, more John Jeff descriptives as we continue.  That's a wax figure.  She's fucking frozen in time now, man. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, my God.  What the fuck's going on there?  She should come...  That picture should come with a warning that your house is built on top of a graveyard.  It's like a Stepford wife.  A Stepford wife or something, right?  She should be in the Pirates of the Caribbean down at Disney.  Oh, so your boys...  I just want to say that picture of your boy.  Anyway, he fucking definitely would be a dude if he would just be a dude.  Man up and say what's going on.  Man up.  Man the fuck up.  Let's say why you're really going to Thailand. 
[02:10:30]  Something tells me he clutches his laptop going through customs, though, going, please don't look at my hard drive.  Jesus.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  We don't know the first thing about these fucking assholes.  I just said something tells me.  We do know some things about them.  Yeah, we know their radio show sucks a dick and regular radio syndicating all over the country.  What's that about, Sam?  Opie, if you'd like to know more...  Ten years strong.  Ten years strong.  If you'd like to know more about John and Jeff, maybe we can play the next little sweeper, right? 
[02:11:00]  John and Jeff show.  John and Jeff show.  We're two guys who think every DMV driving test should be in English only.  We're two guys who think any woman who claims to be experimenting is in denial.  We're two guys who think anyone who steals a shopping cart should be deported.  We're two guys who think mandatory tipping for room service should be illegal.  The John and Jeff show.  The John and Jeff show.  Ten years long.  Ten years strong.  So it was their big ten-year anniversary. 
[02:11:30]  Well, ten years long.  Ten years strong.  Ten years strong.  Fuck.  Representing the third shifters, the insomniacs, you know.  They're pretty edgy with their we're two guys, though.  Yeah.  Wow.  They don't like that fucking tipping of the room service.  Shopping carts and fucking shit.  It's crazy stuff.  That is.  You have to realize when you're on overnights, they're on from like 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.  Uh-huh.  You can get away with a little more.  Well, obviously.  Yes.  Safe harbor.  Yes, Patrice.  No, nothing.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to talk about that.  Bill Donahue's going to be on our show. 
[02:12:00]  He's all over the place, and he picked our show as one of the places to yell and scream  today.  So we're looking forward to it.  Yes.  Jacktober, John and Jeff.  Even more things to make John and Jeff two captivating guys.  The John and Jeff Show.  The John and Jeff Show.  We're two guys who think if you lie about a crime, you gotta do the time.  We're two guys who think vegetarians should just mind their own business.  We're two guys who think the divorce rate would be 80% if a man didn't lose half.  We're two guys who think anyone caught driving without car insurance should have their vehicle 
[02:12:30]  impounded.  The John and Jeff Show.  The John and Jeff Show.  Ten years long, ten years strong.  They're like cartoon characters or something.  Their voices are very cartoony.  It's like, are they supposed to be guys, Sam?  They're men.  They're men.  Yeah.  But they're two guys.  The thing is, they come up with these opinions, and it's not just one of them.  It's both.  I was just saying the same thing.  Both of them.  There are two guys that think the same thing.  All two guys think alike.  No. 
[02:13:00]  That's why they...  Opie and Anthony, we're two guys who fucking don't like you.  But did you ever have that?  Ten years long, ten years, go fuck yourself.  What if they just made you do that?  They just said, we want you to...  Would you quit?  If they said to go...  Turn it to the...  Turn it to the we're two guys, guys?  We're two guys.  Or just, they want you to just start the day off with, hi, I'm Opie.  Hi, I'm Anthony.  And we're two guys who love entertaining you. 
[02:13:30]  For real.  Oh, I fucking really mean it.  Hell, I fucking know.  No, we like it this way.  You know?  We're two different guys that fucking make it work.  What can I tell you?  But listen, are they forcing these guys?  This is what I'm saying.  Are they saying you must be this type of human being?  Maybe they're saying, you know, that two-guy thing really works.  They have a new Elvira?  Or is that the same one?  Is that the same Elvira?  Holy shit.  Is that the same Elvira?  That's the same Elvira?  Is that the same Elvira?  She's got to be 60-something years old. 
[02:14:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  She's going to be at Chiller Theater this weekend.  Really?  Yeah.  She's got to be 60-something years old, at least.  She had tons of work, but look at her tits.  Look at this fucking bitch.  Elvira.  Wow.  She's got to be wearing some kind of push-up.  I really want to smash her, but I think she's getting it done still.  That's stupid Elvira.  Wow!  You think it's the same one, though?  That's got to be.  It is switched around.  It is the same one.  That's Elvira.  She's a redhead in real life.  Is she?  Really?  She's also burned over much of her body.  Really?  Yeah.  She had bad burns?  That's no kidding. 
[02:14:30]  Crackhead?  No, no.  Something happened when she was younger, and she got burned over a lot of her body, except  what you see, her cleavage and shit like that.  But the rest of her body, big burns.  Did they think she was a witch?  Oh, maybe that was it.  They burned her at the stake.  Oh, you know something?  It goes with the whole Elvira thing.  Yes.  Maybe she took it seriously.  The burned thing.  All right, let's go to John and Jeff.  Start their hour with stuff. 
[02:15:00]  What?  What now?  What?  I'm sorry, man.  You didn't give me the giggles now.  I just want to laugh at everything else.  John and Jeff start their hour with stuff you won't hear anywhere else.  It's Bernie Williams playing fucking guitar.  He's been doing the fucking jazz guitar.  I don't want to see no more Bernie Williams.  Burn, baby, burn.  It's dumb guitar.  Holy shit.  And it's jazz guitar on top.  And I'm not even here when I'm playing it.  And you can see by his fingers he stinks.  And his face.  He's like so into it. 
[02:15:30]  Here he is.  Here he is.  Go, Bernie.  There he is.  Bernie Williams.  He plays a good guitar, but who the fuck's buying this shit?  Fucking jazz.  You know what?  I don't know how many people get this, but his wife should be behind him doing this.  She used to fucking smash something right behind the plate every time and fucking annoy  the piss out of me.  His album should be called Bernie's Greatest Hits, Not in Baseball. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, shit.  He should have given that guitar to some of the Yankees so they could hit with it.  Maybe they would have fucking hit the ball.  I don't want to look at his soulful into his face.  Get this shit off.  He's closing his eyes and cursing his lips.  He's shaking his head.  His album should be called I Retired Too Soon.  Hey, you know, you could do a lot worse than Bernie Williams.  Fuck that one up.  Hey, your ex is Elvira today, too.  Oh, no. 
[02:16:30]  There's dueling Elvira's today.  What is she doing?  Oh, yeah.  And Elvira's 58 years young.  Oh, 58.  She's fucking padding that.  Look at her.  She's crossing her legs into the letter A to say hello.  Oh, that's a secret code.  Look at her.  What the fuck is she doing?  Look at you.  Yeah.  She has your hair.  Oh, look how old Elvira is, though.  When she turns her head, that neck does some kind of a fucking lover thing.  That turkey neck. 
[02:17:00]  Is that a prosthetic chest?  Like, it's...  Yeah, I know, right?  Not just a fake tits, but a whole fake upper torso.  They're using...  They're using...  Makeup and shit.  ...makeup and shit.  ...Montalban's chest from the Wrath of Khan.  Oh, look.  That's the one they put on her.  When she fucking turns her head, her neck looks like you're wringing out a chamois.  She is old, but she's still...  No, man.  Look.  If you look at the breasts more, those things look like they're going to fucking just drop  to the floor if they're not being so low.  There's a problem.  They're being pushed. 
[02:17:30]  There's a problem.  What a cruddy-looking old bra.  She looks delicious, man.  A cruddy-looking old bra.  Look at her, man.  Look at how just cruddy she's looking.  Yeah.  That's Elvira?  Yeah.  No.  Yes.  From when?  Maybe not today.  Wow.  I think that might be today.  What's the hot red?  I mean, it's recently.  Dude, that is fucking...  She looks way better with her fucking regular hair and shit.  That is Elvira.  Get the fuck out of here.  No way.  It is.  She looks like the girl next door, apple pie, fucking... 
[02:18:00]  Your old friend's looking pretty good, my friend.  Oh, you like her?  She's looking all right.  I thought she was looking a little better.  She's not doing...  You can't tell with the wig on, but she got better hair now than she had.  She was dyeing it.  Why don't you put a...  Put a polo in, man.  Right?  No, that's done.  There's no way.  Put a polo in, man.  Say happy Halloween.  White people love Halloween.  It's almost like Christmas.  That's white people's Christmas.  Halloween's a safe holiday, too.  Just say happy Halloween.  Yeah, it's safe.  Bernie's album is called Moving Forward. 
[02:18:30]  From what?  Fuck.  Meaning I wish I played a few more years, but finally I'm moving forward.  You know, I've been trying to plan my next special I'm going to do.  I've been trying to plan the name for two years, and I just can't come up.  Like, it's just...  Because every name is douchey.  I think I'm going to call them Patrice on there live.  Dude.  Because these names, these fucking names...  Use your Twitter.  The listeners will fucking come up with it in a second for you. 
[02:19:00]  Just be like Chicago.  I'm telling you they'll come up with something.  Put Patrice 5, Patrice 6.  Have a contest.  They'll come up with it.  It's not a great...  Just something simple.  Patrice, you're killing us with your ADD today.  You're killing us.  No, I love it.  It's great.  People are calling it W-A-D-D today.  Radio.  Oh, it's because they're into what...  Oh, my bad.  Bernie Williams fucked me, huh?  I know.  No.  There's no way we couldn't have commented on that.  I know.  I know.  And I've been trying not to be, but this fucker tuned right in to the fact that that dumb 
[02:19:30]  Bernie Williams was clenching his bottom lip.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Who gives a shit, nigga?  And delicious Elvira and his old friend looking...  Let's go back to these two sissies from Taiwan.  Fuck out of here.  Go ahead.  And look at Sam.  Just like, come on, man.  My hard work.  Go fuck yourself, bitch.  And we got Lazlo outside the studio.  Bill Dahlia.  It's one of those crazy days.  There's Lazlo throwing his hands up.  He's already given up.  Here we go.  John and Jeff start their show. 
[02:20:00]  We're an hour off with some dumb trivia.  Thanks for joining us on The Third Ship.  We appreciate it.  And a special welcome to Insomniacs Across America.  This is The John and Jeff Show.  877-975-6465.  Oops.  All right, America.  Welcome to the show.  Here at Totally Open Phones.  That means more topics.  Better variety.  Stand by for stuff.  You will only hear right here on The Third Shift.  So there's a lot going on.  Grab a cup of coffee, America.  And jump on live.  Get your coffee. 
[02:20:30]  Dude, you got John and Jeff.  You grab your cup of coffee, dude.  Grab your cup of coffee.  Well, don't forget.  It's on late at night.  Grab a cup of coffee, America.  And jump on live.  And John, I've got some stupid, useless trivia here.  All right.  It's in regards to married couples and wives complaining about their husbands.  Oh, boy.  Boy, where do we start?  Honey, have you taken out the trash yet?  Um, here it is. 
[02:21:00]  Here's the question.  I'll get right to it.  Wait, what is that?  I thought there was going to be like a bit there.  Just like one of those.  Like, you can imagine.  Think about it.  Like, oh, but you're married now.  So maybe you could think.  You're sitting at home on the couch.  And all of a sudden, your wife.  Honey, have you taken out the trash?  That's all hack shit.  Huh?  If you find a good girl, you don't deal with that hack shit.  But did you ever have the trash start piling up?  Yeah, we both look at it.  Like, all right, one of us will give in eventually.  Two black eyes later.  She ain't asking. 
[02:21:30]  What the fuck?  That's right.  Do you take out?  Do you?  Are you getting nagged by your woman?  Not even.  Because you're pretty much married to.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah.  It's just not official with you.  Patrice has her trained so well.  She wouldn't dare nag.  But she's not nagging you, right?  She would if I let her.  Yeah, the fuck is wrong with you?  She knows Patrice would just be bitch.  What the fuck are you saying?  She's living the life she wants.  What are you saying to me?  Every time I see you, I no longer.  Now, here's what she got me.  I no longer do anything now.  Like, when I see her, if I drop something on the floor, anything that knows how to bend is broke. 
[02:22:00]  Oh my God.  Like, oh shit.  I dropped something.  Sweetie.  Hey.  Come pick that.  But she set me up to need her.  So I need her to pick up shit.  And carry shit.  Nothing wrong with that.  Carry the bags that I bought.  I bought the food.  I bought the food.  You carry it.  Nothing wrong with that, dude.  Fucking, be a fucking gentleman. 
[02:22:30]  Shut your face.  Oh, really?  And carry bags.  When I drop stuff, I'm like, can you please pick that up for me?  Pick it up.  That's where I'm feeling the age a little bit.  I paid $75 for the Olive Garden the other day.  Please just pick this up for me.  Take the leftovers in a bag.  In your purse.  Jesus.  All right, let's find out about this nagging thing.  Here it is.  Here's the question.  I'll get right to it.  I'm not going to beat around the bush.  About 65% of married women said this was the most annoying thing about their husband. 
[02:23:00]  It bugs them.  What is it?  It annoys them.  It bugs them.  Smelly balls.  What is it?  So this is one of the things you...  P.R.  Toilet seat up.  Yeah.  Only on the third shift.  It's got to be toilet seat up.  Why are you trying to answer this?  Who cares?  It's interesting.  Because I'm captivated by it.  Oh, yeah.  These are two guys who love trivia questions.  I swear I thought the question was going to be, women do this after they break up. 
[02:23:30]  I swear I thought you were going to sneak that one in.  Oh, I wish that would have been hilarious since the third show had the same topic.  I've never hated Sam more than this moment right now.  Because I'm looking down at all the rest of the tracks.  They're all fucking answers to this question.  Are you fucking kidding me?  That's all we got today?  That's what we're going to highlight.  John and Jeff getting me...  This would be a throwaway line.  Of course.  No.  And maybe you hope that someone has a good joke on the lines or someone in the studio, 
[02:24:00]  whatever.  But that's it.  You wouldn't spend too much time on something like this.  Our own listeners have some answers here.  Yep.  Finding another girl in your closet.  Okay.  That seems to be something that they don't like.  Very good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't like that.  I like that.  Hey.  Also, there's something else going on.  ADD Radio today.  And that's okay.  We're just going to go with it now.  Finally.  Chris in New Hampshire has got a name for your fucking comedy special. 
[02:24:30]  If you want to listen, Patrice.  Why did I not?  I'm a fucking idiot.  Chris, you got a name for Patrice O'Neill's new comedy special?  Yeah.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Yes.  Produced by Anthony Cumia.  It could be Patrice O'Neill, Unshackled.  Oh, jeez.  That ain't bad.  That is pretty good.  I was thinking of something with N-Word.  Unshackled.  Yeah.  Just actually N-Word.  Do you want N-Word?  N-Word.  Not nigger, but N-Word. 
[02:25:00]  Something.  Oh, I see.  But I don't want to be topical.  I just want the shit to...  Yeah.  Richard Prye and Carlin never had douchey names.  At the end, Carlin started naming the stuff like, you're all diseased, but...  Yeah.  You know, but that didn't bother me for some reason, because...  That was a cool name, I thought.  Yeah.  Carlin never bought me.  All right.  Let's get back to the two guys, John and Jeff.  They're trying to get the answer to this dumb fucking...  I don't even know what the question is anymore.  Well, Opie.  Oh, shut up.  Okay.  Dirty laundry on the floor.  The old used underwear. 
[02:25:30]  They're on the floor.  Yeah.  Why can't you put it in the basket?  Because I was trying to do a free throw basketball style, and I missed, honey.  I'm sorry.  All right?  I'm like Shaq.  I'm like the...  With a laundry basket, I'm like the Shaq of free throws.  That's why I ended up on the floor, along with the other pair of random socks, the underwear,  and I don't know what that...  Yeah, those are boxers.  Yeah.  Those are the ones that you bought me last Valentine's Day with the hearts on it.  John, that is not the answer I have here. 
[02:26:00]  So now I release it to you, America.  Guys, do you know the answer?  Ladies, take a stab at it, okay?  This is in regards to married men and women, and women complaining about their husbands.  About 65% of married women said this was the most annoying thing about their husband.  It bugs them.  What is it?  What am I talking about?  And I will say I'm kind of guilty of this as well, and my wife has brought it up.  There's no way this is a real radio show. 
[02:26:30]  This is on all over the country.  Ten years long and ten years strong, all over the country.  How the fuck did they fly under the radar for ten years?  Is there ten years long how long he was going to talk about that one fucking underwear bit?  But did you get it?  It's like in the NBA, they have a free throw.  Shut it!  And Shaq isn't good.  Yeah, yeah, right.  He had a concept, but he didn't even have confidence in it.  That was off the cuff, believe it or not, I think.  Oh, really?  Yes.  That wasn't written. 
[02:27:00]  Just like when we go off the cuff.  It's the same deal.  Are you annoyed by that one, Ant?  No, but first of all, everyone knows your maid comes over and fucking cleans that up.  So, you know, why?  People are losing their jobs.  Everyone knows that.  What?  What?  That makes you sound a bit out of touch.  Does it?  You don't want to be out of touch.  Oh.  Remember regular guy stuff?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Relating to the regular guy.  Oh, right.  They don't have maids out there.  Picking up your fucking duty stained underwear.  On purpose, pees on a toilet seat because it'll get cleaned up magically. 
[02:27:30]  Who cares?  Fuck it.  I gotta do it.  There you go.  There it is.  You have a wash up.  Oh, what?  There it is.  How about that one?  No.  She's her?  Julie?  Jesus Christ.  How about that one?  Pant face now.  Oh.  I do not like her money.  You can't talk about anybody.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  Oh, W.A.D.D.  Yeah, of course. 
[02:28:00]  Okay.  All right.  We're back.  Are we back with John and Jeff?  All right.  Let's try it.  We're back with W.A.D.D.  Back to the topic.  We're trying to get the answer here.  Let's try this.  All right.  Let's go to Call.  You're next on the John and Jeff show.  Hi, Call.  Hey, John and Jeff.  How y'all doing tonight?  I'm doing pretty good.  How are you?  All right.  Just out here doing my paper wrap.  Awesome.  I listen to y'all every night.  Awesome.  I want to take a stab at that tribute question.  All right.  About 65% of married women said this was the most annoying thing about their husband.  It bugs them. 
[02:28:30]  What is it?  I say snoring.  Snoring.  I like that answer.  Yeah.  That's a big problem.  Did he actually laugh at the word snoring?  I like that answer, but let me tell you, I don't think that.  What's with the voice?  That's their voice.  No, he has a really odd voice.  He's got a cartoon voice.  Some people were just born with broadcasting voices.  Yeah.  I guess we're just jealous.  And just a bored black guy delivering a paper.  Thank God for joining him. 
[02:29:00]  Why is the black guy listening to these two?  And he called in.  Yo, what's up, son?  Did he say awesome?  Black guys are hip.  Oh, we're cooler than this show.  Like, they're calling, yo, I wanted to take a stab at that shit, yo.  Yeah.  Because my wife was on my shit yesterday.  Um, snoring and shit.  Oh, that's a great answer.  Is he snoring, yo?  That's a great one, but no.  All right.  One more chance with this.  All right.  Punching that bitch in the face if she says something funny.  Oh, hey, we don't condone that here.  We're two guys that think if you punch a woman in the face, you ought to go to prison. 
[02:29:30]  All right, yo.  How about, how about pulling out and coming on her stomach instead of like on her chest  like I told her I was going to do.  Pulling out and coming out of the chest?  Is that?  That was it.  That is it.  Actually, that's the one.  Hey, yo.  Thank you, man.  Hey.  Beating a bitch with these newspapers.  We got listeners that want to take a stab at it here.  Let's go to Brendan in Rockford.  Brendan? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, I was so close, boys.  I thought it was skip the foreplay and spit on a twat.  You got to lube it up somehow.  And we got Matt in Alabama.  Matt, you want to take a stab at the question?  The John and Jeff trivia question?  Yes.  Yeah, I do believe it's ass to mouth with no washcloth in between.  Ass to mouth.  Ass to mouth.  You know, they don't like that.  I can say that, John.  They don't like that.  We're two guys who don't like ass to mouth.  We're two guys that think if you do ass to mouth, you want to know what it tastes like, too. 
[02:30:30]  Take that, John and Jeff, you fucking queers.  Alleged.  Alleged queers.  I don't know if they're queers.  Allegedly.  I know they're good broadcasters.  To my opinion.  In my opinion.  You got to say that shit now.  Well, you know what, though?  In my opinion.  In my opinion.  Fucking shit.  Yeah.  Why even attack?  You can't win attacking guys like this who just can't do anything and you'll end up losing.  They're the limping fucking deer by the watering hole. 
[02:31:00]  That's what these two are.  Next week, you can't do an impression of fucking dice no more.  Let's see if we get the answer here.  Because we have four more tracks of this shit to go.  What is it?  I say snoring.  Snoring.  I like that answer.  Yeah.  That's a big problem for a lot of people.  Yeah.  I found out that I don't think I snore because my wife's never complained.  Ah.  So, and she doesn't snore either, so that's good.  Let's see if snoring is the answer.  That is not the answer I have here. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, you two motherfuckers.  All right.  What's the headline in the newspaper this morning, Paul?  Um, I don't, I don't know, John.  I didn't lick it.  I just grab it.  I can't.  There you go.  Yeah.  I'll just deliver them.  I can't read.  Yo, I just wrapped them motherfuckers up in rubber bands, bitch.  You never seen a newspaper, man, nigga?  It's the same shit like on the news.  What's the, uh, what's the, uh, headline of the paper today?  I don't know some white shit.  Keep it my ass down, rolling up newspapers and shit, motherfucker. 
[02:32:00]  I just hope it ain't me, nigga, in these early, these early morning rapes.  Well, I just throw the papers through the windows to see if they open, nigga.  How do you know that?  I just, I have a fucking, how do you know that?  Do not fucking insinuate.  How do you know that?  That's just, my mind, my mind went to Rapeville.  You're basically saying brothers get paper outs, not for the money, for the paper out,  so they can throw papers at the houses to see if the people are home to Rapeville. 
[02:32:30]  I don't think you know that.  People don't know their paper, guys, either.  Nah.  At this motherfucking, yo, I'm your motherfucking paper man.  I'm here to collect.  What?  Let's get to the end of this track, please.  Oh, shit.  I don't know, John.  I didn't lick it.  I just grabbed him.  There you go, yeah.  Exactly.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Let's get him off the phone quick. 
[02:33:00]  Thank God we got the Negro off the phone.  Oh, that's good.  Fucking scared.  No, it's not story.  Y'all want the paper?  Here's another attempt at the answer.  All right, let's go to Nick.  He's in Portland this morning.  You're next on The Third Shift.  Hey, Nick.  Hey.  How you doing, man?  Not too bad.  Awesome.  What can we do for you?  Yeah, I think I got an answer to the trivia question.  All right.  Here's a question.  About 65% of married women said this was the most annoying thing about their husband. 
[02:33:30]  What is it?  What am I talking about?  I think it's forgetting to put the toilet seat down.  Are we still fighting about that?  It will fight until the end of time.  Are you married there?  Wow, we're fighting over that, really?  You know what's great?  They are so nice because if that guy would have called us with that lead-in, it would  have been, talk, you dumb motherfucker.  Like, they're like, yeah, hello.  That was as angry as he gets. 
[02:34:00]  Awesome.  All we have to do is be nice and we can be syndicated around the country.  You know that, right?  Yes.  Just let's be nice to the callers and the guests.  Fuck the callers.  You guys, they'll fuck us before we fuck them.  You guys are nice.  That's the race against time, Anthony.  We could go, we could just say, like, if somebody doesn't know they're on the air with us on  the phone, why don't we just say, sir, sir, you're on the air?  Because the Opie and Anthony show dispenses a thing called tough love.  Is it tough love when somebody doesn't know they're on the air and we call their mother  a twat? 
[02:34:30]  Maybe they won't.  Next time, they'll remember, oh, I have to answer the phone.  Tough love.  Tough love.  All right.  Well, let's hear what else John and Jeff have because...  Fighting about that?  It will fight until the end of time.  Are you married there, brother?  Yes, I am.  Brother?  Yeah.  What are some of the things that your wife complains about?  She says I leave my empty pop cans sitting around all over the house most of the time.  That's her biggest complaint.  Okay.  Yeah.  You're a guy.  We do those things.  Yeah.  They got to remind everyone, look, in the end, we're guys. 
[02:35:00]  We do this stuff.  We're all guys.  We all leave our pop cans.  Pop cans.  Here's the thing.  We've upgraded from a lot of this stuff.  The toilet seat has been upgraded to, they're upset when the pee is on all over the floor.  And the back part that you pull up, that you want the blue thing in.  And the cups is left there because I was too lazy to get up and go to the bathroom.  So I pissed in the picture while I was playing Xbox. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, no, that's not it, sir.  Sorry, brother.  That's not it.  I know my girl sees fucking piss.  Holy shit.  It comes everywhere.  It comes.  My fucking bathroom's upstairs.  I'm downstairs playing Xbox.  My prostate's swelling up, so I can't make it.  You're a diabetic asshole.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Holy shit.  You could just piss shit all over the place.  It says piss or apple juice, nigga.  Oh, my flow, baby. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, damn.  My girl's so used to my filth now.  It's just like, she gets up.  After I go to the bathroom, I'm at her house.  I go to the bathroom.  She gets up after me and just cleans up to make sure she doesn't sit.  God damn.  And she knows I'm just going to fucking die.  Nothing worse than a nice pissy bowl with hair that looks like a ferret's been doing laps  on the fucking rim.  She pisses at my house like she's at the park. 
[02:36:30]  She squats.  She won't sit on my toilet seat.  Like a gas station bathroom.  She practices that.  She don't sit down in the morning.  She's a foot above the fucking seat.  She's a foot above the fucking toilet seat.  You got to be an animal, man.  It gets cleaned up, but it's just so much disgust everywhere.  That's classic.  Fucking finish.  All over the house.  Most of the time, that's her biggest thing.  Pop cans.  Pop cans.  Yeah.  You're a guy.  We do those things.  We like to leave a trail.  We just leave stuff.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Let's see if that's the answer.  You say about 65% of marital women said the most annoying thing about their husband is  the toilet seat issue?  That is not.  Oh, wow.  That's what I have here.  Oh, that means they're going to have to continue with this, Sam.  Oh, thank God.  And that means we're going to have to continue with this.  Not necessarily.  The listeners want to know.  Do they?  I think so.  That's my sort of gauge.  In some funky way, I want to know, too.  See?  I just want to know the end.  Are there a lot of guys that are like John and Jeff, you think? 
[02:37:30]  Motherfucker.  10% of the population.  Most of them are like John and Jeff.  Do you see what's on TV?  That's the country now.  At least we just don't.  We know it's not, but that's how people are living.  Do you notice that there's only women with an opinion now on TV?  It's only like women that get, maybe Bill O'Reilly at 8 o'clock.  Hannity.  Hannity.  But not an opinion.  Hannity kind of does what he's got.  He's got his opinions now.  Does he really?  Yeah.  They change the show a lot. 
[02:38:00]  It ain't too many dudes.  He holds onto that football and throws it around the room.  Wait a minute, though.  But the opinion that he's supposed to have, what would Hannity have ever said?  Put it this way.  There's no guy that would have ever defended David Letterman on anything right now.  Except, you know, radio.  Oh, right, right, right.  Like, there's no dudes, dudes, nowhere that would have gone wrong.  Right, right.  Yeah, dudes cheat.  Like, if this radio show, somebody talking about some guys cheating, they would never  go, yeah, guys do cheat.  Yeah, yeah.  They would go, those fucking pieces of shit. 
[02:38:30]  Traitors to dudeness.  I fucking hate that shit.  There's no dudes.  None.  No.  None.  They're gone.  None.  Except John.  None.  Joey Behar's on, fucking getting to say whatever she wants.  Nancy Grace.  And all the fucking...  Which one's Nancy Grace again?  Is that the Stroke Mouth one?  The few bitches.  I always get them confused.  Nancy Grace, who's the other one, then?  Oh, Liz...  Nah, the fucking...  I don't think she's around no more. 
[02:39:00]  Greta's been...  Oh, Greta.  Oh, Greta.  Is Greta still around?  Yeah.  That Stroke Mouth to her.  Guys, that's what we do, is leave soda cans.  And can you imagine a bitch going, you left a soda can?  But there's guys that go, sorry, honey.  Pick it up.  Automatically, you just...  And it's not just my girl.  It's like any girl who goes, you left a soda can?  Pick it up.  I just named your CD.  Thank you, Corinne in Jersey.  Go ahead, tell Patrice. 
[02:39:30]  Tell him.  Yeah, diabetic asshole.  Thank you.  That's your new fucking special.  Diabetic asshole.  I'll tell you why that's not good.  Diabetic is too many syllables.  How about diabetical?  As in diabolical.  Oh, Jesus.  Like, it'd be better if it was a...  Please, please, car crash me.  An asshole...  Fucking run me over with a train.  Yeah, diabetic's too long, but I do appreciate that.  That has a ring to it.  Well, we could still call you an asshole, right?  Something asshole?  Patrice O'Neal. 
[02:40:00]  Asshole.  N-word asshole.  Nigger asshole.  That's just hilarious.  You said N-word, though.  That's fuck, I know.  What is it funnier to say?  Patrice O'Neal.  Nigger asshole.  You should call it N-word asshole.  That's so funny.  Just have it.  N-word asshole.  I don't think you're getting on many shows to promote it.  And here's Patrice O'Neal.  His new album, Nigger Asshole, is in stores now.  Patrice, tell us about it. 
[02:40:30]  What?  What?  Well, I'm a nigger.  The station's off the air.  And I'm an asshole.  All right.  There we go.  All right.  John and Jeff, trying to get the answer to this.  Oh, we still had John and Jeff?  I don't know.  What the fuck, Bull?  See, doesn't it just fucking frustrate you?  What is going on here?  What's wrong, everybody?  Hi, Dennis.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  Awesome.  Fixing to take my little break here from trucking.  Awesome.  What type of rig are you rolling in?  I got a big... 
[02:41:00]  You're trying to sound cool.  What type of rig are you rolling in?  Awesome.  Yeah, and awesome.  Awesome.  Everything's awesome.  Jesus, they're the heroes of vampires.  Like, motherfucker.  Nobody who sees their son likes them.  Some poor motherfuckers deliver newspapers, and they said awesome.  He goes, what are you doing, delivering newspapers?  Awesome.  You know something?  Great job.  It's not awesome for that guy.  It's not awesome.  Jesus.  Awesome.  What type of rig are you rolling in? 
[02:41:30]  I got a big Freightliner Classic.  Awesome.  There you go.  Love those old Freightliners.  What can we do for you?  Well, I'm going to try that trivia.  Okay.  If this isn't it, it's got to be right up there in the top.  All right, here it is.  About 65% of married women said this was the most annoying thing about their husband.  A chopping up a hooker in the bathtub.  I told you to pick up your clothes.  I told you to take out the garbage.  Not listening.  Oh, not listening.  I told you.  That's a really good answer, but that is not the answer I have here. 
[02:42:00]  I thought that was it.  Okay.  It's not good radio, and it's not a good answer.  There's nothing good about it.  I disagree.  A few people are saying you should call it N-word A-hole.  I like that.  Huh?  N-word A-hole.  And there's a lot of parallel thinking out there, because a lot of people are coming up  with that one.  N-word A-hole.  N-word A-hole.  Hey, it's not bad.  It's not bad.  N-word A-hole.  So, uh, what are you doing?  I don't do much. 
[02:42:30]  I have mesothelioma.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Jesus Christ.  Awesome.  Awesome.  But see, the listeners, dudes are living with that kind of nonsense.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Dudes are living with their wives.  I get yelled at.  All of them like that.  For leaving pop cans around.  Pop cans.  Awesome.  You left your pop can in the kitchen again.  I'm going to pop you in the eye.  What happened to the good old words? 
[02:43:00]  Will you shut the fuck up?  I've been shut the fuck up.  Will you shut the fuck up?  Like, does that even exist?  No.  What happened to shut the fuck up?  My ex used to tell me, yeah, well, you know, I've had to step over your clothes three  times already.  Then pick it the fuck up.  Right.  Help each other out.  It's in your way.  It's in your way.  You could bend over and pick it the fuck up. 
[02:43:30]  I do shit.  I just don't fucking bitch to you that I had to do it.  I never sat there going, you know what I had to do today?  I had to do this, this, this.  But they're always, oh, I am picking up your stuff.  I had to do this.  I didn't fucking mention it.  You know what I had to do today?  Shit that I should do for myself.  Yeah.  Shit I should be doing for myself.  I had to do the motherfucking deposit and check today, myself.  Yeah.  I had to sign the back.  I had to mail my motherfucking P-S-E-N-G.  Yeah. 
[02:44:00]  Where you at?  Yeah.  What'd you do?  You see the bags?  Okay.  Look, I take my fucking bags down to the Chinese lady to wash them and I get the bags.  Do you see them?  Do you see the clean clothes piling up in the garage?  Do you see them?  Bring them the fuck inside.  Fucking.  They already folded.  Find a place.  Gotta put them in.  And then just tell me.  Where's my note to tell me where the fuck my drawers are?  Fuck.  You know, you're supposed to just help each other out.  I mean, and Ant was fucking, he was fucking holding up his end. 
[02:44:30]  He's in the city becoming a radio star.  Oh, yes.  I remember the good old days.  Fucking pick up his stupid clothes.  I cook.  I shop.  Give a shit.  I cook and shop.  All right, let's go.  Brad might have the answer finally to this fucking trivia question.  I hope not.  John and Jeff.  Jack Tover.  I hope not.  All right, let's go to Brad.  You're next on the third shift.  Good morning.  John, Jeff, how you guys doing?  Good.  How you doing, man?  Awesome.  I'm doing really, really good.  I think I got a trivia answer for you.  Okay.  About 65% of married women said this is the most annoying thing about their husband. 
[02:45:00]  What is it?  What am I talking about?  Well, I think it goes something like this, okay?  You're walking out the mall with your wife doing the Saturday thing, and out of the corner  of your eye, you see this hot woman with the goods.  Uh-huh.  Nice words.  And you try to do the subtle look, the little head turn or whatever, but it seems like women  and wives in particular have this third sense, and they have this radar, and they can kind  of kneel where your head and your eyes are.  And I think it's when you have the wandering eye and you look at other women that really  bothers wives in particular.  It does bother them, doesn't it? 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  That's what I guess.  They were trying to debate whether they were going to fucking dump that whole thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got scared there.  Oh, boy.  This one could get me in trouble at home.  It does bother them, doesn't it?  Yes.  Yeah, because girls are just fucking throwing themselves at John and Jeff.  They should be lucky if they are married or have a chicken life.  It does.  It does, doesn't it?  Because we're...  I think number one is when your woman worries, when you out loud to yourself say, I like to 
[02:46:00]  stick my head right in her asshole.  I want to smell her asshole.  It does bother them.  Oh, I wonder what her asshole is.  That's my guess.  It bothers them so much.  That's the answer.  Wow.  Checking out the other ladies in public.  No wonder guys wear sunglasses.  See, because they're checking out Snatch.  Yeah.  What was the answer?  It was girls get mad when they're men. 
[02:46:30]  Check out other women.  Bullshit.  It's number one.  Check out other chicks.  Stop it.  Really?  Holy shit.  Yeah, but women do get mad at that.  That is an absolute truth.  Yeah, you got to tell.  I will agree with you on that one.  But you're going to waste a half hour of your radio show talking about it?  Well, you could.  That's the point here.  If the third shifters want to talk about it, you could, right?  So the brim of the hat works too.  You cancel out your chick's eyeballs with the brim of your hat.  And then you know you're safe to look over. 
[02:47:00]  How about this technique?  Yes.  When your girl goes, you want to go to the mall with me?  You go, no, bitch.  And then you walk outside and sit on your fucking porch.  How about this technique?  That's a technique.  How about this technique?  No, bitch.  No.  How about I'm going by myself?  That's a technique.  My dreams is technique.  How about this technique?  No, bitch.  No, bitch.  You want to go to the mall with me?  Nope.  We've got to get her on the show. 
[02:47:30]  I know she listens every day.  We've got to get her on the show.  My money will be along for the ride.  I'll stay here.  My money will go with you.  How much do you need?  What are you going to get?  Your nails done?  Here's 150 bucks.  Keep the change.  And I'll see you later.  And I'll look at other hoes.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Let's finish up Jacktober with John and Jeff.  Pick me up the Bernie Williams CD while you're at the brim.  I need a coaster.  We've got Laszlo outside studio.  We've got Bill O'Donohue standing by.  Bill O'Donohue?  I don't know how the fuck we're going to get all this in today. 
[02:48:00]  You'll find a way.  We'll try.  John and Jeff talk about being a dude.  That's right.  The last track from John and Jeff today.  Yeah.  You know, I think every guy's guilty of it.  Whether you're married, obviously single guys.  We're men and we're programmed to look at things that are cool.  For instance, we see a...  This guy doesn't sound like a man, though.  For instance, I don't know, a girl of 12 or 13 of Southeast Asian descent.  Yeah.  And we're programmed to look at things that are cool. 
[02:48:30]  For instance, we see a nice-looking Corvette.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, that Corvette is sweet.  We see a nice-looking woman that's...  Well, how shall I say this?  Gifted.  I am happily married.  But we're going to look and we're going to say...  Oh, my God!  Jesus!  He had to say that.  You can hear by his setup.  Girl that is gifted.  I am happily married.  Because you know why?  He goes home and she has to fucking, you know, ask him a lot of questions about the show every  fucking day.  You said...  He puts a delicious asshole, right, in the same category.  Yeah.  Like, looking at some fucking girl bent over and seeing her asshole and vagina just... 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's in the same category as a juicy steak.  As a car.  A car.  And he had to preface it with the car first, because as a cool painting.  I'm not thinking the girl.  I'm thinking and talking about the car, honey, when he gets home.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I said we're happily married.  Oh, he's got to explain himself every morning.  Oh, yeah.  Every fucking song.  Every noon when he gets home or whatever.  And you know when you say you're happily married?  The nine.  Sometimes if you, you know, you have to say you're happily married... 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, you have to keep telling yourself.  Yeah.  Right.  And telling her.  We're happily married.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My girl knows I don't fucking like her.  She knows I love her.  And that's where I'm going to be at.  But you don't like...  It's just, you know, she knows a lot of the animosity, because I share the animosity,  that's all.  Yeah.  You share it.  That's it.  You just go, look, I'm fucking...  I don't want to be here.  I got a question for you.  One of them's married, happily married.  Do you think his wife misses being fucked the right way at this point?  You can't sit here and think that she doesn't. 
[02:50:00]  I don't know.  That's terrible.  But that's if she ever was fucked up, because if it's...  But again, you know...  I don't know.  That fucking two...  That two...  I don't know her either.  I'm just saying.  Like, it doesn't sound like...  It doesn't sound like he's a...  I think any man...  You don't fuck any girl the way you should be...  If you ask to marry a girl, or you...  I think if you marry her within a year or two, you never fucked her the way she's supposed 
[02:50:30]  to be.  Like, you supposed to...  Before...  Like, I think I'm gonna marry my girl soon.  We discussed it yesterday.  Yeah?  Because I don't have health insurance.  Oh, shit.  She's listening.  And I think that we...  Can't you fake it a little bit?  We're getting married because...  No, that's a common...  That's a common...  That's common in the...  She doesn't want to hear that.  We're getting married like two gay guys getting married.  Listen.  Yeah.  We need...  We need the benefits.  Look, I understand.  But she doesn't want to hear that deep down.  I mean, she knows it, but...  What is she fucking...  Look, she's very practical, man. 
[02:51:00]  I know she wants some romance.  So you're getting married just because of the health insurance issue?  She don't like being called a bitch no more.  I can tell.  No.  Oh, when I call a bitch, she's had it.  That's old now.  And she's tired of me introducing her as my girlfriend.  Yeah.  She really wants fiance bad.  But she...  You know, I think I'll just...  I'm just...  Yeah, she's going to do it.  She's going to do it.  If we end up in...  I tell you what, if you hear that I went to Vegas or Reno...  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit, yeah.  We're definitely doing a James Brown wedding.  Doing that?  I'll do it.  It's going to be a quickie. 
[02:51:30]  Quickie's not even...  Single on Thursday, married by Sunday.  I might get myself ordained as a minister to marry us, just to marry me.  Patrice, Patrice, you take this bitch...  Yes, I do, nigga.  Yes, I do, bitch.  I ain't no bitch.  But if you don't fuck this shit...  It takes years to fuck this shit out of a bitch.  Like, it takes years, five, six years to fucking just ravage this woman.  To get to the point where what, though?  Like, like...  To where you go, I have... 
[02:52:00]  We have done everything.  Oh, everything.  Okay.  All right.  And then you go, you know, let's get mad.  Fuck it, man.  You know, she's been a trooper.  Yeah.  And, you know, you don't want to let her go out into the world after what you did.  No, no.  You know what I mean?  All right.  Let's get to the end of this clip.  Why?  We see a nice-looking Corvette.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, that Corvette is sweet.  We see a nice-looking woman that's...  Well, how shall I say this? 
[02:52:30]  Gifted.  I am happily married.  But we're going to look and we're going to say, nice.  We're going to do that.  That's how we are.  Let's be real here.  We're not going to lie and sugarcoat it and say we don't do that.  But have you ever deliberately not looked at a woman that your wife or girlfriend thought you were going to look at?  I did that on dates, but I'm secure enough.  My wife is secure enough to where, you know, if you look for longer than a second or you do a head-to-toe thing and you make a comment, you're being disrespectful.  That's straight-up rude.  You don't do that to a lady. 
[02:53:00]  You just don't do that to your wife.  You know?  Holy shit.  This guy is a fucking pussy-whipped asshole.  Oh, come on.  But he's just...  He's not a pussy-whipped.  He's a fucking...  That's what bothers me.  No guy...  This is shit that we have been transformed into.  We've evolved into this.  Because just in the 50s, you can put a phone book on your girl's ribs and punch it.  How do you know that? 
[02:53:30]  In the 50s...  That's great.  Hey, Dame.  In the 50s, you can rape your wife on top of a jukebox with a poodle skirt on and she can say nothing.  The cops would tell her to scram.  Nothing.  Yeah.  Like, you can't...  All of this horse shit.  It's all phony.  Because that's the only way women can be on top of the situation.  Yeah.  Is if dudes just decide that we're going to give it all up.  That motherfucker cannot honestly believe what is coming out of his mouth. 
[02:54:00]  No.  No.  Because he's betraying his gut.  Yeah.  He's betraying what we are.  He ain't betraying...  Like, socially, we're all kind of...  We gotta, you know, submit to some degree.  Yeah.  But he's betraying the honesty of being what a man is.  He's talking about being a guy and, oh, we're just guys, guys.  And then he comes out with a line that no guy in his right mind would fucking say.  The disrespect thing.  That's just disrespect.  Here's a line.  Here's a line.  Here's a statement that should never get any flack. 
[02:54:30]  Men are close to being a perfect creature.  As a creature goes, as a creature goes, we're a better creature than women.  Uh-huh.  It just shouldn't be an argument.  Right.  It's just we're...  No one wants to be a girl.  Like, nobody goes...  No man goes, boy, I wish I could bleed.  I wish I had to worry about fucking getting pregnant.  Yeah, true.  I wish I could sit down to pee.  I wish I had weaker bones. 
[02:55:00]  I wish I needed that Boniva.  I wish I got menopause.  Like, I wish I wasn't cool after 50.  Like, we're just to be a...  Not fucking society, because there's women bosses and things.  But just as a fucking two creatures walking around, we're men of the shit.  Men of the shit.  But, why the fuck can't we say that?  Like, why is that a bad thing to say?  You gotta say fucking shit like, you know, that's just disrespectful. 
[02:55:30]  That's just disrespectful.  And if women go, we're the shit, and we're the best, and then dudes have to go, yeah.  And then girls go, yeah!  I bet they get calls, like, or emails.  It's like, you know, I really like what you said today about that being disrespectful.  You know, that's very...  Not enough men say that.  Well, that's true.  There aren't a lot of men who go out and say that and represent women.  Fucking smack you in your head.  Yeah, let's...  We gotta break.  Oh, boy. 
[02:56:00]  Laszlo's pacing.  I know.  Bill Donovan.  It's crazy now.  Yeah, yeah.  Laszlo, did you guys do any of the new...  Well, we're gonna talk about that shit.  I'm supposed to do some voiceover.  Did you do the Chinatown one, or the new fucking...  We've done them all.  You've done the new ones?  We don't know what we're allowed to say.  I can't talk about...  Really?  Laszlo fucking fired me for my little appearance.  Well, he should have.  You can bring it up with him when he comes in here next.  You know what?  Fuck Laszlo.  That's right.  Damn.  What's he promoting now?  He's promoting some good shit. 
[02:56:30]  More games that'll sell a billion copies.  We gotta break.  Yes, let's take a break.  We can't even fuck around anymore.  Patrice is gonna be at Bananas Comedy Club, Hasbrook Heights.  Oh, no.  These are down the road.  So just follow Patrice on Twitter.  Big Mama Proz.  And he'll keep you up to date with his shit.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Oh, no.  Don't do that.  That's amazing.  Holy shit, we're already checking out the new game.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neal, Laszlo from Rockstar Games in studio.  I am so offended by the new game. 
[02:57:00]  Why are you offended?  Because I saw a black guy banging a white girl in the game.  That looked good, didn't it?  In the bathroom.  In the bathroom.  It's a nice thing about the new GTA.  You can take chicks in the bathroom.  Look, I like him.  He was nice.  Is that a cutaway?  Some of them are cut scenes.  Other ones, it depends because you meet chicks in the club in the game and you get their number  and when you see them in the club the next time, they'll just take you to the bathroom  and blow you.  Oh, damn.  You guys have finally said, fuck it all.  I love it.  Yeah, they just have fucked you. 
[02:57:30]  I've been reading the articles over the years.  Now you're like, you know what?  Fuck everybody.  We're going to make the game we want to make.  Yeah, absolutely right.  It's like people over the years have given you shit no matter what you do.  So now it's just like, good, fuck you.  Right.  Here it is.  Blowjobs in the bathroom.  Fucking cave our head in.  Whatever you want to do.  If they can do it in The Sopranos, why can't you do it in a video game?  Yeah, exactly.  I hear you.  Fuck it.  Wow, this looks great.  Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City.  Yeah, it came out this morning.  It's two full games on one disc.  It's got The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. 
[02:58:00]  The Ballad of Gay Tony.  What's that about?  Interesting name.  Maybe you could tell us a little bit about it.  I thought we'd stir it up a little bit.  One of the characters in Grand Theft Auto 4 was named Tony Prince.  And these two games, which are the sort of sequels to GTA 4,  interweave with the story a bit.  One of the guys, Tony Prince, runs all the clubs in the city.  And you play as, and by the way, that gentleman was not black.  He was Dominican.  Oh.  And so you play as Luis Lopez. 
[02:58:30]  And your partner is Tony Prince.  Yes, hello, I'm Tony Prince.  There's actually a gay club in the game for Steve to go visit.  I was dying to get him to come in and do one of the voices for it, too.  But it would turn it too cartoony.  Yeah.  But, yeah, the club scenes in the game are pretty amazing,  especially with, when you go into the women's bathroom,  you can hear chicks in the stalls doing coke or getting bulimic. 
[02:59:00]  I love it.  Which was a lot of fun to direct with chicks.  I'm like, all right, you're a bulimic coke whore.  Hey, Ant.  Yeah.  It's a bit awkward because Bill Donahue just heard that he's on hold.  Damn.  We're talking about a video game, Bill.  Go after him.  No.  Yeah, let's get Bill Donahue to go after Rockstar Games.  No.  Get him off R-Round.  Nah, he's all over Curb Your Enthusiasm right now.  That's a Bentley, isn't it?  Yes.  You guys, let's go to Bill Donahue, 
[02:59:30]  and we'll go back to Laszlo and the new Rockstar Games here.  Bill, how are you, sir?  Bill, how are you guys doing?  You didn't just hear that last two minutes, did you?  No, it didn't piss me off, don't worry.  Oh, good.  Well, let's get right to it, then.  Speaking of being pissed off,  you seem to be all over the place.  Larry David, of course, did an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm  where he takes some kind of drug  because he's having urinary problems,  and when he urinates at an employee's house, 
[03:00:00]  a picture of Jesus is up on the wall,  and some of his urine gets up by the picture of Jesus' eye,  and the people in the house go in the bathroom afterwards after Larry leaves  and say, oh, my God, it's a miracle  because they think the picture is crying,  and they want to take this on tour.  Now, obviously, Bill, you have a problem with this.  Basically, what is your take on it, and why the problem?  Well, you know, most of the stuff that seems to cross my desk lately 
[03:00:30]  is always gratuitous.  It comes out of nowhere.  It's not even integral or functional to the show.  So you wonder, what is it about the writers that they feel a need to?  Let's see now.  What can we do?  How can we tick off Catholics?  Obviously, nobody would piss on Obama  because then you'd be a racist,  and you'd be obscene, and we know all about that.  Ain't been to my house.  Yeah, I mean, as I say, you know,  listen, we can put some feces on a picture of the mother of Larry David  and then just see how much he wants to laugh about it.  You know what, though? 
[03:01:00]  I watched the episode last night just to prep for this, Bill.  You know, I do prep for you.  And what I saw was something that was kind of,  if you have a knowledge of Curb Your Enthusiasm,  it was integral to the story because it is outrageous,  and he does put himself in these odd, very awkward situations.  I don't think it was gratuitous.  I don't think it was prolonged.  It was something that had happened, 
[03:01:30]  and it wasn't as if he was doing it to desecrate Jesus on purpose  or the image of Jesus.  It was part of the story, as we've seen in the news many times,  people proclaiming they see miracles happening  with Jesus crying or Mary bleeding.  Why would you take this as being any more than that?  It's a cheap shot, and it's always Jesus  or it's always a Catholic priest or a nun.  It's never anybody else's religion.  You don't think so?  You know, it's the same old nonsense. 
[03:02:00]  I mean, and if it's not with them,  I just put out a statement just now.  You know, we look at these Halloween costumes, okay?  Some immigrant groups are complaining  because they have an illegal alien out there.  We know when there was a Danish cartoon of Mohammed,  people led to violence in the street.  Now, there are costumes of nuns and priests out there,  which are fine.  There's costumes of Jesus, which I think are funny,  as well as imams and ministers and rabbis.  But there's only one costume  where it shows one clergyman with an erection, 
[03:02:30]  and the other one is a pregnant person.  I'm talking about a Catholic priest and a pregnant nun.  Now, it's not being carried in Walmart and Target.  Right.  I've seen that over the years.  When I was a kid, I used to see people do that.  Sir, Bill Donahue, sir.  This is Patrice O'Neill.  Do you think God needs your help in these matters?  So why don't you just stop?  Like, that's all I'm saying.  Why don't you just stop being the representative for God? 
[03:03:00]  I heard you say I about three times.  Here's my problem.  I always have to make things racial.  How come the upsetness is not the fact  that Jesus always looks like Charles Manson  instead of what he really is,  somebody from the Middle East?  No, he wasn't.  He was the son of God,  and God, we all know, is a white man.  Why doesn't that offend you?  Why is the fact that he looks like a session drummer?  I think we need more Amos and Andy  and Little Black Sambles.  Yeah, we do.  And Bill, and this is what he wants, 
[03:03:30]  because everything is really,  it's like snitching.  It's like, why don't I,  how come we can't do,  you can if you want,  but you don't make fun of anything,  so you want people to not make fun,  to have fun.  Make fun.  What about the joker face?  What about Michelle?  We can make a,  she gotta do your thing.  Do your thing, Bill.  Let's hear a good Michelle joke.  Let's go, baby.  I'll laugh if it's funny.  Her ass is a little big. 
[03:04:00]  Go ahead.  You get my point.  No, I don't get your point.  No.  Sure you do.  You just, you just,  I don't care.  Yeah.  How about I don't care?  Maybe you would.  Really?  No, you don't know me.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not you.  Wait, wait, what do you got on Al Sharpton?  Al Sharpton would be the first one  to go for your head, of course,  if anything like this happens.  We see what happened with Ivan.  Okay.  Okay.  All I'm saying is that,  one more time,  we got this duplicitous,  hypocritical people out there  who say,  leave off the gays.  Oh, I could have some fun  with some gay costumes. 
[03:04:30]  Let me tell you about that.  But they ain't going to go there,  are they?  They're going to just choose  one group over and over and over again.  But you're not giving me any reason.  This is, it's like,  any reason?  It's like, no, no, wait a minute.  It's like,  sometimes it's like having,  you ever have a woman  and she says something's not funny  or something you think is not funny, right?  And then you go, okay,  well, make it funny for me.  Can you please tell me,  say something that makes me go,  you know what funny is. 
[03:05:00]  Well, did you think  what Larry David did was funny?  It could have been.  He should have been able to do it.  No, that could have been.  Was it funny?  I don't think Patrice  actually saw it, unfortunately.  The tear I did,  I saw the clip  and the two women  that got on their knees  and thought he was really crying,  he was making fun of those goofs  as opposed to pee on Jesus.  Yeah, it wasn't a desecrating  Jesus thing.  He's just making fun  of the Catholic woman.  Is that what it is?  No, he's making fun of...  Yeah, they're hilarious.  You don't think people  are a little crazy?  You guys don't even see it, do you?  You can't even connect the dots. 
[03:05:30]  You're so cool.  You're not connecting the dots.  No, I do.  It's cool.  You're being self,  I don't even want to say righteous,  but you're just,  dude, stop.  I think Larry Day  was making fun of the fact  that people find  the image of Jesus  or the Virgin Mary  in an English muffin  and then next thing you know  they're traveling around the country  showing everybody  and people blindly believe  that something  actually happened there.  And that's not Jesus again.  That's a white guy.  That's a white guy 
[03:06:00]  with long, delicious hair.  Let him speak.  Yes, Bill.  But you've got fringe people  in every demographic group  in society  and the question is  why is it not legitimate  fair then  to pick on that fringe group  within other different groups?  Larry David  makes many Jewish jokes  about himself  on Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Nothing vulgar,  nothing obscene.  No, but it's very  stereotypical Jewish.  Yeah, but you know what? 
[03:06:30]  Again,  I just gave you an example.  I don't care even about  costumes of Jesus  and priests and nuns  as long as they're just  making some light fun of them  as they do others.  But when you have  the kinds of vulgar stuff  that I described  and it's only my group,  my clergy,  my religious,  then you have to begin  to wonder  why do we have this pattern  over and over again?  Can you tell me  what we got here  is a crusader.  Can you tell me  what we got here  is a crusader.  It's a victimizing.  You're victimizing,  again,  you're victimizing 
[03:07:00]  Catholicism.  You're victimizing  because you're like,  it's the reason  why I can't,  listen,  it's the reason  why I can't say  nigga no more.  White people  have figured out  a way to get  black people  not to say nigga no more  by saying the N-word  because if you can't  have fun,  nobody can.  So you think  Christianity is under attack  but it ain't.  It's a Jesus joke.  And you still didn't  answer me.  Bill,  Bill,  you still didn't  answer me  about this white Jesus.  You still didn't  answer it.  What about white Jesus? 
[03:07:30]  I don't care about that.  What if I'm offended  that Jesus is always white  when he's from  the Middle East?  Well,  I mean,  that's not vulgar.  That's a matter  of interpretation.  Why aren't you  upset about that?  But the Catholic League,  we don't care about that.  Okay,  if you're upset about  a figurative  act of  defamation  against  fake Jesus.  But it's a fake  Jesus.  If you're in a picture  of your mother,  you're not going  to get upset.  It's a fake 
[03:08:00]  portrayal  of Jesus.  I don't believe you  for a moment.  You don't believe yourself.  You're just trying to  stop people  from having fun.  Stop.  Leave people alone  that like to have fun.  People agree with me  than they agree with you.  Yes,  why don't you just  go into rooms  with them  and leave  people who are  funny alone.  Tell your friend  Al Sharpton  and his buddies  at the end of the place.  There you go,  my friend.  Because he's black.  He's his friend.  Bill,  we know what you really are.  You're going to slip up  as you keep talking.  Black people know each other.  I agree with Bill  on this one.  You're going to slip up 
[03:08:30]  and the real  R-word  is going to come out.  The R-word.  What's the R-word?  I'm not saying it.  You know what it is.  I don't know what it is.  What's the R-word?  It's the R-word.  If you use the N-word,  you're an R.  Not me.  Exactly,  but you know  what the N-word is.  You're an R  if you use the N-word.  Yeah,  you're an R  if you use the N-word.  I have no idea  what the R-word is.  Of course you don't.  Bill,  if you get mad enough,  you could call him,  you know,  what you want to call him.  Go ahead.  Say it.  Say it, Bill.  It's in your heart.  Let it go.  Don't let it fester, Bill.  Get it out.  You've already been saying it 
[03:09:00]  in this condescending manner.  What if I put  Amos and Andy,  huh,  Mr. Negro?  How about your friend Al Sharpton?  How about your friend  White Jesus?  Let me talk.  I'm just showing  what a phony you are.  No, you're not.  Oh, shit.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  You're not fun.  You're not fun.  Little black Sam.  We can read it.  Hey, what are you?  There you go.  That's what Bill really is.  That's what he really is. 
[03:09:30]  That's what you really are.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  I know.  You see the anger?  He came on very diplomatic.  Very diplomatic.  You try to justify bigotry  against one group,  but then you get upset  when it comes back.  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, you kind of did.  You kind of did.  Say what?  You kind of did.  What did I do?  You kind of did.  What did I do?  You kind of did.  Just tell me what I did.  You kind of did.  Tell me what I did.  No, no, no.  I'm asking Bill.  Bill, what did I do, Bill?  What did I get mad about?  My point is simply this.  Everybody has a hot button,  whether it be Jesus  or Mohammed 
[03:10:00]  or a black minister,  whoever it might be.  All you got to do  is find that button  and you press it  and you get the same reaction.  Yeah, the button  I'm pushing with you.  There's a tendency  in our culture  to push the buttons  of Catholics  more than any of the group.  Okay, when did this start?  Has this been historic  or has this started yesterday?  Leviticus.  It started Leviticus.  This has been around for a while, fellas.  You know when it started?  It started when people  started paying attention  to people like you, Bill.  When we started going,  uh-oh, Bill said something,  so we got to be scared of it.  Bill, just stay out of fun business. 
[03:10:30]  You know what Xbox 360 is, Bill?  Stick to stoning women  that are unholy.  Let's go back to the rules  on when it's okay  to enslave people  or when it's okay  to turn your daughter out  as a whore.  Let's go Old Testament  right now.  If you want to talk  about offensive...  This is a white guy  talking now, by the way.  I'm not black at all.  He looks like Jesus, actually.  I'm from Oklahoma.  Yeah, actually,  he does look like Jesus.  This shitty shirt there  proves he's white.  I bought this in Oklahoma.  It's all Western.  It's a Western shirt.  It's a Western outfitters. 
[03:11:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  And just so Bill knows,  Laszlo will be going to hell  with what he does  with his life.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  So there's a guarantee there.  So...  I'm with you, sir.  I don't like the trees.  What is HBO saying  about what you're saying, Bill?  Same thing.  You get what I'm saying, right?  Yeah, you think  you're going to get  an apology  or any reaction to this  by HBO or Larry David?  No.  Listen, Bill Moore  has been defending Catholics  for years.  There's something pathological  about that man.  He's totally irrational.  And if HBO puts up with him, 
[03:11:30]  then...  I threatened...  I just joked on TV here  about two years ago  that I'd like to meet up  with him in Madison Square Garden  and put the Everlast on  and I'd beat the hell  out of that punk.  He goes on Larry King  in a serious vein  and says,  Bill Donahue of the Catholic League  threatened me with violence.  What a punk.  Yeah, because you know  what he did?  You know what he did, though, Bill?  He's got to like  Bill Donahue for that.  He took you literally.  Oh, he took you literally?  He took you literal, Bill.  But when you was joking,  you were joking around figuratively.  He should have known it.  Shouldn't he have, Bill? 
[03:12:00]  He should have known  you were joking,  Mr. Serious.  Lordy, Lordy.  Oh, my goodness.  You're threatening  to let him down.  Jesus Christ, then.  He had to figure...  He had to know  you were joking, didn't he, Bill?  I was joking, too,  and look what happened to him.  Yeah, man.  We weren't happy  about that one, Bill.  We weren't happy  about that one.  Hey, we were joking.  We were joking.  Bill, you don't know me,  but do you know  I was the first one  to defend him?  Who?  Bill Donahue.  Yeah, Patrice fucked up  his TV career  because he went on 
[03:12:30]  and defended Imus  and he hasn't been back since.  He defended Imus.  And he was great.  He was great on TV.  He did a lot of TV  before that.  Right is right, Bill.  And what you're doing  is wrong  because it's selfish.  It's selfish.  Huh?  How so often  went for the jugular  and even after the man apologized  he still wanted to get him fired.  I didn't ask for anything like that.  Then what's your end game  as far as this Larry David thing goes?  What would you like to see happen?  Look, I've never asked  for the government  to come in  and resolve these problems for me.  All I'm simply saying is this. 
[03:13:00]  I run an anti-defamation organization  and just like the ADL  and NAACP  and GLAAD  and NOW  and all these other different groups  when you see something  that you think  crosses the line  you're expected  to draw public opinion  to try and persuade them  to your side.  All not funny groups,  by the way.  None of them are funny.  That's true.  Like, why don't you stay  and listen,  this is the deal I make.  Why don't you just stay  in the realm  where if somebody goes  if somebody goes  seriously  I love  I will piss on Jesus' face. 
[03:13:30]  Stick to those people  who seriously want to do that.  We had that.  Instead of  Wait a minute.  We had that last year  when a professor  from the University of Minnesota  intentionally took  a consecrated host  and drove a rusty nail  through it to say  listen, I don't give a damn  about the body  and blood of Jesus Christ.  I'm an atheist  His name is P.Z. Myers  There's a lot of animals  Now, can you agree  can you agree  that just  that, okay  that Larry David  was trying to be funny?  Yeah, look 
[03:14:00]  I don't think that  because somebody  offends me  therefore  he's necessarily  a bigot.  We all tell  jokes that could  offend somebody  but I know a bigot  is when he does it  over and over  and over again.  I do say  there's a problem  at HBO.  This is the first time  to be fair to you  Okay, Patricia  Larry David  do we see  that he's a recidivist  a repeat offender?  No, he's not  Joy Behar  some pathological bitch  who constantly  is going after  the Catholic Church  Larry David  is not that way.  Wow  I don't like her either 
[03:14:30]  You gotta love  Bill's opinion  I know  I'm glad  I'm glad  this is not like  1806  because he'd be  running down here  on his cart  Oh boy  when I have no thumbs  and a lot of tar  and feathers on me  How bad do you want  to drink with  Bill Donahue  to find out  what really goes  on in that head?  I'd like to catch him  doing something  This is him under control  This is too much  of a zealot, man  Stop that nonsense  I mean, Larry David  has obviously moved on  He doesn't care that much  He's gonna move on  to the next target 
[03:15:00]  He's made fun of cripples  and everything else  on the damn show  The real problem there  is HBO  because Sarah Silverman  went after Catholics  two weeks earlier  and whose show  did she do it on?  Bill Maher's show  Where's that shown on?  HBO  So there is a problem  over there at HBO  Bill, let's just  say it together  It's the Jews  It's always the Jews  Let me address that  It's like Ali Frazier  It's like Ali Frazier  If you look at  anti-Catholicism  in this country  from the time  of the founding  up through  I'd say about  roughly through 
[03:15:30]  the mid-20th century  anti-Catholicism  basically came  from one group  Protestants  I would say  over the last 50 years  it comes from two groups  Catholics who are alienated  one foot out the door  and left-wing secular Jews  Very little of it  comes from Protestants  It's been a big change  in the landscape  Well, I still have  The landscape  I still have  home blasphemy  Like there's  office  I like that one  Home blasphemy  office  We got a lot of 
[03:16:00]  religion and a lot of  racism thing  happening right now  What if Larry David  did the same joke  but it was  I don't know  Malcolm X  or Martin Luther King  and then his  P got on  like a portrait  What about Obama  Alright, Obama  Let's go to  Alright  It wouldn't be Bill  See, Bill's not  It wouldn't be Bill  It would be Reverend  Right  And that's what  I was saying  This is where  it gets messed up, Bill  You're a man  See, people  historically  who are for humanity  who are just for humanity  get killed 
[03:16:30]  in some kind of way  Jesus  was for  completely the opposite  of what you stand for  He was for being  everybody  being together  He didn't start a religion  He was starting like a movement  of love  But  No, what I'm saying is  Al Sharpton  His job is to  get offended with Malcolm X  Your job is to get offended  with Jesus  Somebody else's job is  to get offended with Muhammad  But the idea is  there's no humanity there  It's still secular  It's still xenophobic 
[03:17:00]  It's terrible behavior  We're not human anymore  You're doing what you're  supposed to do  You're not angry  at other things  You're not angry  at cruelty  to animals  You're not angry  at genocide  in Africa  Because  Are you, Bill?  Cruel to animals?  I think this case  before the Supreme Court  I would come down  on the side of saying  that that's not  protected speech  under the First Amendment  when Madison wrote  talked about  freedom of speech  There's a case  that the Supreme Court  has agreed to hear 
[03:17:30]  they won't render  a judgment  until the spring  I don't think  intentionally  being cruel to animals  should be freedom of speech  Yeah, it's usually  freedom of religion  if you choke a chicken  and then  you do something  like that  Everything that's wrong  should be  mentioned by anybody  on any group  if it's just wrong  Larry David has free speech  I have free speech  I didn't ask for anybody  to get fired  I don't understand  what the big stink is  about me  You are a defender  of the faith  Yeah 
[03:18:00]  So when he says  He's a gatekeeper  of the faith  He speaks out  and makes people aware  that him and his constituency  are not happy  with what went on  When it's taken over the line  and people lose their jobs  over it  and things like that  then I have a problem with it  This guy can say  whatever the fuck he wants  Fair enough  But I would love these people  And when I say these people  I mean everybody  who's an advocate  Oh 
[03:18:30]  Please  Could you just be fun  for five seconds  Do something frivolous  Nothing fun about damnation  Wait wait wait  He's got a sense of humor  Bill what do you find funny  What do you find funny Bill  Who's your favorite comic  Who's my favorite comic  I'll tell you what  For years I've liked  Jerry Seinfeld  I mean I think he's  I have to say  Larry David's a brilliant guy  because he created that show  And I guess that was part of  the thing that made us wince  Why would a guy that smart  have to stoop this low  That's really sure  Well it's kind of  cutting edge in a way 
[03:19:00]  It really is  because it didn't  It wasn't  It wasn't perpetuated  through the whole thing  It wasn't done with  malice and stuff  It was part of the story  That wheelchair episode  was hilarious  It's like as if  you guys are saying  that I'm painting him  as if he's a Klansman  or something  All I did was say  Me?  I put out a statement  called urinating on Jesus  and I described what happened  and I didn't like it  Alright  You know  I could deal with that  I'd like to actually  have a few beers  with Bill  and let him start  getting into that  Sambo thing 
[03:19:30]  You couldn't keep up with me  I know  Well let me tell you  Oh wow  That's a challenge  right there  Bill Dutty  who said he can't  You can't keep up with him  I have two kegs in my house  Do you have two kegs  in your house Bill  on tap constantly  I have loads of kegs  in my house  I live up to the stereotype  of being Irish  Damn  I'd like to do that  I want to hear these  little Sambo stories  and everything  You know after a few beers  it's all just  There's no coffee allowed  in my house  Just beer  I have no alcohol 
[03:20:00]  He's got those little  black guys with the lanterns  out front  Oh he's laughing at that  He likes that  We can hear it  And he can't have fun  Bill's got to go  He's very busy today  I've got another radio show  I've got to do  But hey Patrice  You're a fun guy  Maybe sometime  we'll go out together  and we'll get loaded  No  Thanks a lot Bill  Take it easy  No  No  That was a great discussion 
[03:20:30]  I like that  I like that a lot  Patrice is just there  Because I'm just going off  about the situation  Patrice is there  Into the mic  I'm saying  Alright here he goes  Just can we just be  Can we  This shit  It's so corny  I know  It exists  I heard you  Loud and clear  But it's just so fucking  Like these people  are never  They're always interfering  with people  Let funny people  have a police  Yeah  And go  Funny police  And if you challenge  What's his name 
[03:21:00]  Larry David  You go  Larry  You go  Is it any other way  you could have made  that joke funny  Let's say you thought  of that joke  Is there any way  you could have made  it funnier  without pee  So you go  Well water  I could have been  washing my face  A mistake pee splash  On a Jesus  No you expect it  To be pee  With Larry David  If you know  Curb Your Enthusiasm  The idea is like  Holy shit  I fucked up  Like it's the  Awkwardness of  Yes  And he acknowledges  In the show  He fucked up  He wasn't like  Purposely going out  Like what I'm going to do 
[03:21:30]  This fucking Jesus portrait  It's not like  It was an accident  It's not like the artist  That goes out  So he kept it a little safe  And you know  Pisses on a crucifix  And then rubs crap on it  And says this is my art  You know it's different  Than that  I gotta jump in for a second  Because Patrice  It's an ongoing theme  With our show  The big problem  Is the people that listen  To Bill Donahue  Reverend Al Sharpton  And the rest of them  That's the real problem  I don't give a shit  That these guys  Are protecting something  That they believe in 
[03:22:00]  I don't care  Yeah fuck it  But all of a sudden  People rally around  Someone like Bill Donahue  Or Reverend Al  And get people fired  That's  Those are the people  I have a real problem with  People that are looking  To get offended  And they fight  They fight  But look at what's  Happening though  It just goes into  Something like  Yesterday I bought  A couple of  Video games  And they want  Your ID now  Like your ID  To buy adult  Video games  Dude yeah  And they boop  And it's just  It's a world 
[03:22:30]  Of this kind of  Martial status  This law  It's overwhelming  Where this guy  Bill Donahue  Said I  In his riff  At least three times  I  I  It gives you  This godly  Listen I always knew  Bullies  Look  Like  Let's be honest  Early in my life  Early in my comedy life  Man  You can make fun of Asians  All day long  All day long  And Indians  As soon as an Asian  Like got a little power  Got somebody fired 
[03:23:00]  Now you think  They go okay  We're gonna be a fair  And just fair people  And go after things  That are frivolous  Yeah good ruck  Any  Exactly  Exactly  So it's like  You can't  Now you can't  Be fucking made fun of  And it's just shocking  Look can you make fun  Of black people  Of fucking course  Can you  If I love making fun  Of white people  Yeah  Why the fuck would I say  You can't make fun of black people  I know  Or Asians  Or anything  And it's that eye  It gives him this power  He's on a fucking radio tour 
[03:23:30]  Gotta go everyone  I got another one of these to do  So now he's just  He's just watching  For someone to fuck up  Look look  He  Yeah because we gave him power  You know  We the media  We the fucking people  Gave guys like Bill Donahue  And Reverend Al Sharpton  Fucking power  Let me tell you something  Bill Donahue got us fired  For the Sex for Sam thing  Because he went on TV  Yelling and screaming  About what we did  And then the people listened  The fucking people  The fucking company  The fucking suits  They listened to Bill Donahue  Instead of telling them 
[03:24:00]  Go fuck yourself  These guys made an honest mistake  That day  Or that wasn't funny  Same thing with fucking  Imus with the Reverend Al thing  People listened to fucking  What Reverend Al was spewing  Reverend Al technically  Didn't get Imus fired  It was the people  That were listening to him  Imagine if people  If Funny had a police  And the Sex for Sam happened  And just  The funny police said  They leaned into the TV  And looked at  Obi Anthony  That just wasn't funny  Yeah  Didn't  Wasn't funny  And we all agree 
[03:24:30]  A lot of people  Just took a vote  It just wasn't funny  And then you go  Which by the way  Try better  And you slide away  But I'm saying  Which by the way  I agree with  Just  It was a shocking  Little bit  That fucking blew up  In our face  But I'm not saying  It wasn't funny  But let's say  You tried  We know you tried  Didn't work out  As opposed to  Destroy life  Get you out of here  You're fired  Right  Stay out of funny business  You know what amazes me  Is that Bill Donahue  The way he was talking about  Like Reverend Al Sharpton  They are exactly the same 
[03:25:00]  They really are  They're the same people  They're exactly the same person  Absolutely  Negative  They're just a negative image  If you peed on a picture  Of Malcolm X  Or Martin Luther King  Yeah  Or a black religious figure  Say Jesus  Hi motherfucker  You  You  You wouldn't  He wouldn't hear from him  Cause Al Sharpton  Is in charge  Of black people's problems  Yeah  But that's where  It goes away  It's like  The human  And Al Sharpton  Should be  On board 
[03:25:30]  With Bill Donahue  That's how you know  It's racial  Because Al Sharpton  Is fucking  He's a Baptist  Which is Christian  He's a Christian  You'll never  You'll never have to tell me  Pee on Jesus should be  His fucking problem too  You'll never have to tell me  That it's racial  With Reverend Al  What I'm saying  This is where  It's all horse shit  Cause he's in charge  Of white things  Happening to Jesus  And Al's in charge  Of black things  Happening to Jesus  But what the fuck  Once again  How many beers  Before the nigga jokes  Come out  With fucking Bill  Bill Donahue 
[03:26:00]  How many beers  Two, three  Nah he's got a tolerance  So he'll hold out  A little bit longer than that  You see what's coming out  And I don't think  Oh he was laughing  Oh I know  If we had ten more minutes  Yup  That's why he had to get off  That word would have popped  He had to get off  He's like  I'm ready  Oh my god  I think he knew  He was ready  Cause we were told  Pull a Kramer  We were told we had him  Until 10-15  So I think he was losing control  Cause he was getting ready  He said Sambo  A couple of times  What if somebody  Shit on your black mama  Yeah  He started on your mama 
[03:26:30]  And you know  I'm from Boston man  That is fucking phase one  Yeah  Of white boy shit  Yeah  Phase two is watermelon  And chitlin  Exactly  That's phase two  It's what if I do something  To you nigglet  It's to get  Right right right  I'm way past that shit  Motherfucker  You can't  He was on that  I can feel him  And he would have got  To that point  Yeah  What was really great  Is listening to him rant  About religious stuff  And in the background  Is GTA 
[03:27:00]  Like this insane  Violence  Anthony was losing his shit  I'm trying to  Things are blown up  There's hookers  I was trying to lay  The whole thing out  For the audience  And I turned my head  And saw a man's head  Explode in a car  It was fucking  And Lazlo  That's why I said  You're going to hell  Cause you're  You're behind  These games  And he loves his job  This award is fantastic  Yeah why don't we  Say get into what  Lazlo's up to today  Because we're running  Out of show fast now  This boy loves his job  I'm going home  And fucking playing  He's like  Social commentary

[03:30:00]  Right  You know  And kind of create  Our own world  That is  That looks very familiar  And let's be honest  If you called it  New York City  It would be like  All of a sudden  Bloomberg would come out  And go  This game is horrible  It's showing  The police  NYPD  And firemen  Being savage  And ravaged  And speaking of  Bloomberg  It's gotta be said  His pep rally  Fucking sucked a dick  He's an asshole  We should get the audio  Of the pep rally  He was the lamest  Fucking pep rally  Guy ever  Does this city love him
