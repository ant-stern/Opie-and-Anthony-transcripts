<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a self-congratulatory montage followed by shocking and offensive statements.  The main focus then shifted to a detailed discussion of their recent interview with Michael Madsen, who infamously declared the Opie and Anthony Show the worst project he'd ever worked on.  Madsen's candid opinions about Hollywood,  Matthew McConaughey ("the guy in the towel"), and his own career choices (often citing financial reasons like "the mortgage was due") were recounted at length, along with anecdotes such as his early job pumping gas for Fred Astaire.  Clips from the Madsen interview were played throughout the show, notably a story about a Sam Peckinpah film set where chickens were doused with lighter fluid. The hosts declared it "Michael Madsen Tuesday" in honor of this interview.  They also discussed the unexpected departure of Rover from their Cleveland affiliate and Anthony's recent trip to Atlantic City, which included a poker encounter with Howard Stern and a less pleasant meeting with his ex-wife's lawyer.  Anthony contrasted the Borgata's luxurious treatment with the shabbier Atlantic City casinos.  Jimmy Norton provided audio of himself repeatedly vomiting, and the hosts briefly touched on Fidel Castro's resignation, Gary Coleman's sexless marriage, and the Big Brother contestant's offensive remarks about people with autism.

The show continued with a discussion of the acronym "NAG" (National Associate Advocate Group) and a humorous explanation of "punching out" in the context of fighter pilot ejections.  A repetitive song containing the word "retarded" was played, sparking listener calls with varying opinions on the appropriateness of such humor.  One caller criticized *The Ringer* for its association with the Special Olympics. The broadcast then transitioned to the Oscars,  including a brief musical interlude from *Juno*, and an announcement of Larry the Cable Guy's upcoming appearance.  A promotional piece for their animation contest and upcoming screenings of *Be Kind Rewind* were also aired.

Larry the Cable Guy joined the studio, prompting comments on his weight loss.  Their conversation covered his upcoming shows,  *Witless Protection* (and the debate over its title), and his views on the presidential election, including a mocking of a particularly bad Hillary Clinton campaign song.  Further discussion included the hosts' opinions on other candidates (McCain, Romney, Ron Paul), *American Idol*, and a CMT reality show aiming to transform non-country singers.  Mr. T was highlighted as a "Black History Month" honoree.  The recurring segment "Is Tom Alive?" featured Tom, a listener with a terminal illness, updating the hosts on his deteriorating health and plans for ending his life, causing visible discomfort to Larry the Cable Guy, who left early for an appearance on *Regis and Kelly*.  The show concluded with further banter, including observations about Larry's eyes, a final listener call, and a clip from "A Bronx Tale" featuring Rich Voss and Chaz Palminteri.

A later segment featured more discussion of Michael Madsen's brutally honest film reviews on his website, and played messages from the "FU Line," filled with angry and profane messages.  The show then transitioned to promote an upcoming guest, Locke from *Lost*, and the animation contest, highlighting frustrations with CBS's pre-selection of "safe" clips. A 911 call story about a woman dying in a house fire while on hold with dispatch was shared, followed by discussions of Farrah Fawcett's death, the banning of a children's book about gay penguins, Lindsay Lohan's Marilyn Monroe-inspired nude photoshoot, and the "dirtiest" book listeners had read (excluding pornography).  The segment concluded with discussions about Lenny Bruce and Rich Voss's deficient impersonation, more audio of Jimmy Norton vomiting, Kenny's car troubles, a brief interview with a Newsday columnist, Laura, and a mention of a behind-the-scenes meeting.


A subsequent segment focused on Rich Voss's experience playing Lenny Bruce, including Voss's account of minimal preparation, the director's alterations to his hair, and his performance of his own stand-up instead of an impersonation.  A debate on the necessity of mimicking Lenny Bruce's voice and mannerisms ensued, with Sam Kinison calling in to offer humorous critiques alongside actual Lenny Bruce audio.  The conversation shifted to a promotion for a "coin cleavage" contest, sparking a heated exchange between Travis and Steve, the advertisement's creator, who was repeatedly called in and out of the studio regarding the advertisement and website issues, including gay singles banner ads.  Several comedians, including Chris Rock, called in.  Rich Voss discussed a kidney tumor, and a discussion of uncircumcised penis gags was interrupted by further website ad discussions.  Graphic details and speculation about Merv Griffin's alleged sexual history, including encounters with River Phoenix, were discussed.  The segment ended with banter about the Mega Millions lottery, upcoming guests Lewis Black and Terry O'Quinn, and Eastside Dave unexpectedly stripping down to his underwear on air.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shock, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Two mentally retarded women strapped with remote control explosives  where we use this unwitting suicide bombers.  Run! It is Pete Rose!  This is where entertainment is going.  You're a drunken pig and you're not sexy.  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver that isn't you. 
[00:01:00]  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver letting you sober.  You're a sick freak!  What is the biggest piece of s*** you're involved with?  I think that's the way to go with this interview, I'm thinking.  This show.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh my god.  Hey, good morning.  Well, that clip is in the intro now. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, as soon as it happened, we're like, you've got to get that in the intro of the show.  Michael Madsen was on our show Friday and we had so much fun with that guy.  We've got to replay that the next time we take a day off.  That clip is great though.  Oh, pretty much asking, what's the biggest piece of crap you've ever been involved in?  Because he's made some movies that were pretty bad.  He knows it.  He doesn't shy away from it.  Free Willy comes to mind.  Yeah, stuff like that.  So it's like, what's the biggest piece of crap that you were ever involved in?  And after just a couple of seconds of pondering it, he goes, this show. 
[00:02:00]  A couple?  There wasn't even space between.  A couple of seconds.  There wasn't even space between the question and the answer.  It was Michael Madsen, of course, from Reservoir Dogs, the famous scene with Stuck in the Middle.  Oh, yeah.  Playing and all that.  Um, and it was obvious he just didn't want to answer any questions.  But he was cool.  Like, you could tell you weren't really supposed to just have a regular interview with this guy.  No, no.  We hung with him for just about an hour.  And it was nothing but hysterically funny crap. 
[00:02:30]  He's open and honest about Hollywood and what a bunch of douches they are.  I'm so irritated I missed that.  Why is he better?  Because he's a great actor.  Well, I don't know what it is, but he seems a bit bitter that he's not getting a lot of roles.  And he's got to go to, he's made 18 movies in one year and they're all made in like Peru or Scandinavia.  Bulgaria was one of them.  Bulgaria.  Wow, he's such a great actor.  I know, we're thinking he either is extremely difficult to work with or the way he is is the way he is and he has no depth to his acting abilities and just plays that guy. 
[00:03:00]  He's definitely a bridge burner.  He definitely hinted that there's a lot of young guys in Hollywood that are getting his roles.  What's that?  The guy that wears the towel?  Which one?  Yeah.  The guy comes out without a shirt and has the towel on?  Yeah, hire him.  Hire him.  Just making fun of young Hollywood. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, yeah.  Basically saying, look, they might look good, but they don't have any acting chops.  Yeah, that was good.  And all he would call him was the guy in the towel.  Matthew McConaughey.  Oh, is that who he is?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's beating him up.  The guy in the towel.  That's great.  He's right.  That's who he is.  The guy in the towel.  And then on his website, he...  Big knot in the front.  On his website, he reviews his own movies, and basically, he gives you the list of movies  you should see that he made, ones that skip it, ones that he hasn't even seen, and then 
[00:04:00]  explains why he made some of these movies.  Like, I forgot which movie.  One was great.  He goes, the mortgage was due.  Yeah.  He goes, the mortgage was due, so I made this piece of garbage.  What's his website, Iraq?  MichaelMatson.com?  Yeah, yeah.  Funny.  So, just a lot of fun.  I think we got a new friend to the radio show.  Absolutely.  Yeah, I was reading the...  Wackbag had a review.  It was really informative, all the questions that were a lot of the interviews.  Oh, cool.  You asked him a good question, but I can't remember what it was. 
[00:04:30]  It was annoying me.  MichaelMatson?  It was a good question.  Yeah, I'm mad.  I can't remember what it was.  I don't remember.  We were just...  I don't even remember really, like, asking questions.  We were just kind of doing the hang with him.  I'm laughing my ass off.  He had so many great Hollywood stories.  Just great, great stories.  He worked at a gas station, and his first customer was...  Beverly Hills, yeah.  His first customer was Fred Astaire.  Comes in with a flat tire on Christmas Eve.  And then after he started getting acting gigs, his boss gave him an ultimatum.  You know, what are you going to do?  That or this? 
[00:05:00]  And he's like, eh, let me really think about that.  Yeah, should I pump gas for you?  Pump gas for...  Or get a movie career?  Pump gas for $2.50 an hour.  Yeah, $2.50 an hour.  Maybe get in a movie.  Take it easy.  Ray, I'll get back to you.  Yeah, I'll get back to you.  Ray!  Ray, I'll get back to you.  Ray, that was the guy's name.  Oh, man, the intimidating freaking eyes just...  I introduced myself.  I go, hey, Opie.  And he just starts laughing because he knows it's a dumb name. 
[00:05:30]  And he wasn't even going to hide it.  I'm like, all right, I like this guy.  He was cool.  Yeah, right on.  Good job.  Let's say hi to Joe in Cleveland.  Joe, what's going on today?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning, Joe.  Yeah, we're live in Cleveland.  I don't know what the hell happened, but...  Nice.  We don't know.  We don't care.  We're just glad you're back.  Thank you, sir.  I hear Rover's out.  I hear that they couldn't come to an agreement or something.  That was the announcement we heard this morning. 
[00:06:00]  Okay, so he's moving on.  The thing we heard was the ecstasy of gold, and we are overwhelmed with joy.  Welcome back, boys.  I appreciate that.  And you know what?  Yeah.  I'm not going to say anything bad about Rover.  He was always cool to us, so I don't know.  I don't know what's going on.  I don't really talk to the guy, but...  Well, why don't you keep talking because you know more about the situation than we do.  Sure.  Well, good luck to Rover.  You understand I was just using you to set up our whole Cleveland spiel, you idiot.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Good out, boys.  Welcome back.  Thank you, Joe.  I appreciate it. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, I mean, Rover was always good to us.  Always good to Jimmy when he was in town.  Always good to our comedian friend, so I don't know what's going on.  I'm sure he'll be fine in the end.  Of course.  But we're not going to sit here and like...  And pun.  And pun.  And pun.  Crap.  Wow, that's a great hook.  Huh?  That's a great hook to have.  Yeah.  And pun.  And pun.  Start using that.  It's wonderful.  I guess we were the last to know, by the way, because I think we were on in Cleveland  yesterday, even though we didn't do live radio.  And I had to find out, not from our agent or anybody, but from somebody else really late 
[00:07:00]  last night and quickly sent an email out to everybody.  In the company?  We were pretty much the last to know.  That's all right.  It's better to be the last to know when you're being added to a station.  You think?  Yeah.  Than to be the last to know when you're being taken off.  Well, a lot of people calling from Cleveland already, so thank you.  That's nice.  Thank you.  That's pretty cool.  Jimmy was in San Francisco all weekend.  Was that good?  It was great, actually.  Yeah.  I have a lot of ONA fans out there complaining that we're going to be off their AM station next  month.  I guess that's not been made.  Oh, that PD can't wait till. 
[00:07:30]  He hit the press like a few months ago going, look, I'm just writing this contract out.  We want them gone.  We want them gone.  Yes, we understand.  Why is he gone so bad?  I really don't know.  I mean, we don't really talk to the guy.  No.  I mean, we were on the FM.  They moved us over to the AM, so I think he was forced to take us.  We don't want any station to be forced to take us, to be honest.  No.  You know, we'll find some places to broadcast from, no problem.  People that get the show like Buffalo and Boston and Cleveland and Syracuse. 
[00:08:00]  And New York.  Yes, of course, New York.  Do they still want us here?  I hope so.  I hope so.  I just had a good time.  I have a little audio of myself.  They're cutting up from Valentine's Day night.  What?  I normally come in with audio.  From what?  I wasn't feeling well.  From the stage?  No, from my room.  You record yourself in your room?  Yes.  This is great.  What's going on, Jimmy?  I'll just let them bring in.  There's nothing that terrific.  It just sounds funny.  I don't want to set it up like it was just the most amazing moment and you're like, 
[00:08:30]  That's it?  No, it's good.  It's a nice candid moment, it sounds like.  I haven't heard it.  Let's just say, wow, fish on a plane.  Good move, Jim.  Oh, no way.  Really?  Yeah.  There's fish on the plane.  Why would you order the fish on a plane?  Because they had three pastas.  They had three.  I asked them, we only had three for this flight. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Three.  When are they going to understand that some people do like to eat healthy?  Well, apparently, the fish is supposed to be a healthy food to eat.  Not if you're ordering it on a plane.  Not on a plane.  Where are you?  You're in the air.  Fish like the water.  Why would you order fish if you're up in the air?  How far away from the natural habitat of a fish is it when you're on a plane?  Say you order the steak because you're closer to cows than you are fish when you're flying.  Right.  Because they're at the land level. 
[00:09:30]  That's the logic.  You have to go below the ocean.  That's the logic you got to use.  And the fish is always, oh, I was going to say the birds.  I said the fish because I'm sick.  Chicken's always good.  Even though they're a flightless bird, they're a little higher up.  They can, when they get scared, flutter, flutter.  Ralph from Belleville is like wondering why we didn't give Mike Mattson, you know, some  of the rah, rah, rah, rah, because we were kissing his ass so much. 
[00:10:00]  Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.  Oh, well, you can't, you know, blank sex.  Yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  You know.  Is he joking that we kissed his ass so much?  Hey.  The guy's a great guest.  He gives us great radio for almost an hour.  And what are we supposed to do?  Get on and bash him?  You jerk.  Don't I love the people that don't appreciate our passion for what we do?  If we have a guest in that does great radio for us, yeah, we're going to show some excitement.  I'm sorry. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  We're not bitter at, you know, F still doing this job.  Why don't you throw something at him?  Yeah, okay.  We get excited.  Why don't you make him mad so he walks out?  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll do that too.  Instead of just having a great time with an actor that's amazing, been in movies, some  of my favorite movies.  And yeah, that's what we'll do.  Yeah.  That's a smart move.  Yeah.  Sorry that we show some excitement there.  I don't know what to tell you.  That's why we're on the radio and you're just emailing us. 
[00:11:00]  I hate that.  Wait, uh, E-Rock's saying he's got a good Michael Madsen ID.  You know what?  This is Michael Madsen Tuesday, I just decided.  That's what we do now.  Ooh.  That's what we do now.  Nice.  E-Rock, what do you got?  Hey, this is Michael Madsen.  You're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton.  He's not really my pal.  I've never met the guy in my life.  I like him.  And he's just chewing gum the whole time.  He didn't even spit his gum out.  You hear him.  Hey, Jimmy Norton.  All right, listen.  We just turned the show into Michael Madsen Tuesday. 
[00:11:30]  One time, one time only.  We're not doing this every Tuesday.  Of course not.  Get the guys in the back room to start cutting up audio from the interview.  Just quick little Michael Madsen clips.  Some golden tidbits from his interview.  They don't have to be long, long-winded crap.  Just little quick ones.  Some of the funniest stuff was just two or three words that came out of his mouth.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  See, people are already requesting Michael Madsen clips.  Scott in D.C., what's up?  Oh, God.  Hey, man. 
[00:12:00]  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, you got to tell Jimmy about the story he told on the movie set with the chickens.  Yeah.  Wasn't that...  Lighter fluid?  That's what I'm going to say.  Chickens and lighter fluid, okay?  Yep.  Don't ruin it.  Wasn't that Sam Peckinpah?  Sam Peckinpah.  I've been doing Michael Madsen all weekend long.  Why not?  Why not?  Just kind of talk like this.  Chew your gum so they look like they were sleeping.  Don't ruin it.  I absolutely do want to hear that story again. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  That one you can go long form.  The chicken lighter fluid story.  Cut that one up because that was great.  What a twisted piece of work, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let's go to Gary in Canada.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good.  Good.  I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not.  I'm enjoying President's Day for you folks down there and up here in Ontario anyway.  We had Family Day yesterday, which is a lot of fun.  But anyway, I caught last night that Adam Carolla is supposed to be on the next episode or next series of Dancing with the Stars. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, no.  Yuck.  How about yuck?  Yeah.  And what are we supposed to be excited or something, Gary?  Well, I don't know if you're supposed to be excited or not, but I thought maybe it'd be, you know, make for a couple seconds of interesting radio.  It's kind of weird.  I mean, all the people they could pick and they pick him.  Like, what is he going to add to the show, really?  Yeah.  Promotion.  Promote it.  Promote it a little bit.  It doesn't seem like they really need to promote that show, though.  That's true.  They've got quite a handful of stars this time around. 
[00:13:30]  They've got Monica Sellers.  Yep.  And what was her name there?  The Hot One from American Pie.  You know, I've got to tell you, we weren't even going to do a break on the fact that Adam Carolla is on the next Dancing with the Stars.  But now we've got to, I don't know, I saw the faces.  It was a lot of, who gives a craps?  Yeah.  It's in the back.  See, I don't even know where it is in the paper.  You know what?  We're going to cut our losses with that.  Yeah, good luck to Adam.  What can I tell you? 
[00:14:00]  Anthony, how was Atlantic City, man?  Oh, fantastic.  Yeah.  Fantastic.  It was over at the Borgata.  The Borgata.  Is that still the only place to go down there?  That's the only place I really go.  You know, that marina section, they're building it up.  They're putting a little MGM over there.  The Boardwalk casinos.  I'm not a big fan.  I'm not a big fan.  I went to one.  I was pretty much scared.  Yeah.  It was infested with hookers, like my old place was infested with mice and cockroaches. 
[00:14:30]  The buildings are just too old.  The decor is horrible.  You go into a room and they're awful.  But the Borgata took care of me.  It gave me a suite that was just ludicrous.  Wait, can I explain my statement before you go?  Yes.  I was scared because there were so many hookers around because it wasn't the pretty woman type  of hookers, by the way.  No.  These were just ghetto broads.  Right, right.  And you know, I had razor blades and all sorts of tools of danger. 
[00:15:00]  Shaving?  Of shaving.  They were just scary, scary people.  Just, you know, right around midnight, man, the whole place turns.  They turn over the place.  Yeah.  And it's just infested with these ladies of the evening that are just downright scary.  See, that doesn't happen over there at the lovely Borgata.  I was there.  The Borgata babes are all walking around and, you know, they're very nice. 
[00:15:30]  You go to like the Trop.  I went there once.  Oh, my God.  It was like the women with the beehive hairdos that work at the diners with all the plates  up their arms going to a table.  How you doing, honey?  They're the ones that are working over at the other casinos.  But see, that would be kind of fun in a way.  No.  You're supposed to see something different.  It's not.  No.  It isn't.  When you have a Borgata babe walk past you, I defy you not to turn your head and look. 
[00:16:00]  It's just that that's how they are.  They put them on weight restriction.  Remember that?  That whole big controversy that they couldn't gain a certain amount of weight and everything.  That was the Borgata?  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, I saw on the TV in the room they put out a calendar featuring the Borgata babes.  So that's nice to look at while you're there.  And then I was playing poker at first.  So I sit down at the poker table and they start roping off the table next to me. 
[00:16:30]  So I'm like, what's going on here?  A lot of guys are like, what the hell's going on?  They're roping it off.  So then there was a little bit of commotion.  So I turn and look and here he comes, Howard Stern and his cronies to play at the one-two table.  What's the one-two table?  It's the one-dollar table.  Oh, really?  Just a bunch of white chips, the cheapy chips.  And it's in the high roller section of the poker room. 
[00:17:00]  But he's playing for a dollar?  Yeah, they're dollar, just dollar, two dollars.  Is that the minimum?  Two dollars.  Two dollars?  Yeah, it's pretty much the minimum bet.  But the blinds are one dollar and two dollars.  So the bets, you know, you're betting out two dollars.  I like to go up pretty fast now.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  So I'm just playing over at the table right next to him.  And apparently somebody caught a view of me, and I saw somebody tell someone else at their table, and the word kind of got around. 
[00:17:30]  And then the guy got up, walked around the table to Howard, and told him.  And he looked up and looked over, and I gave him a finger-waving toodaloo hello.  So I just went, hello, Howard.  And he started laughing, said hi.  Said, oh, you guys, you're playing at the high roller table. 
[00:18:00]  And I said something about, yeah, I'm losing all my XM money.  And, yeah, then it was just, you know, them playing at their table, me playing at ours.  When he got up to leave, shook my hand and left.  Seemed nice enough.  But he had, like, 20 white chips in his hand.  And I think he was asking the person where he goes to cash them in.  I was like, could you just give it to the dealer?  That's 20 bucks for the love of God. 
[00:18:30]  Cheapo.  You're worth a few bucks.  Yeah, I think he could afford to give the poor dealer 20 bucks.  Leave the 20 white chips behind.  Don't worry about your white chips.  Yeah, throw it to the little people.  But that's the way you should do it.  You sit down, you have a few laughs, and you walk away with 20 bucks.  Not like you, where they're bringing you changed of clothes and diapers.  That's true.  You know what's funny about that story?  They see Howard coming, and they know what he makes, right?  Yeah.  And they're thinking, all right, we're going to get a biggie.  It's going to be a good one. 
[00:19:00]  It's going to be a biggie.  And he breaks out the white chips.  But there were so many people taking pictures of us.  And you can't take pictures in the casino.  It's not allowed.  But they were taking out their phones and snapping and getting the right angle so they could get us both in the shot.  Right.  Because it's like, and another guy's just, I can't believe it.  I got a picture with both of them.  That's never going to happen again.  So it was, that was interesting.  And then earlier in the day, I should have known something was up. 
[00:19:30]  And it was because Artie was playing there.  He was with Nick DiPaola.  Which we promoted, by the way.  On Saturday night.  We promoted big time for those guys.  Yeah.  Which is weird.  The two shows are just, I don't know what's going on with the two shows at this point.  We'll see.  There's so many people that get along.  It's weird.  But anyway.  So I'm getting something to eat before this whole poker thing.  And I hear from behind me, hey, how are you?  Yuck. 
[00:20:00]  I turn around and there he is.  My ex-wife's lawyer, Dominic.  Now it's time to say.  And his wife.  Yuck.  So he puts his hand out to shake it.  And I got my sandwich in my right hand.  Yeah.  So I just kind of give him this limp-wristed left hand shake without looking at him.  And, uh, so, uh, how are you?  How are you?  Uh, I was good.  And he starts, like, talking like, like, I want to hear this. 
[00:20:30]  I don't want to talk to him.  Well, people understand that's the lawyer that represented Ant's wife in the divorce case.  Still does.  Still does.  Ten years later or whatever it is.  I've lost track.  Still does.  I got a meeting at three o'clock today.  That involves, uh, legal stuff because of this, uh, uh, divorce that's been over since  19 friggin' 99.  Why would he think it's okay to just, uh, have small talk with him?  I don't know.  I think lawyers are such animals that they don't understand the concept that just because 
[00:21:00]  we're not in a courtroom doesn't mean I don't still hate you.  I, I, I, I, you, you put me through more agony and hardship that I can't just separate  the moment now that you're just a human at a casino.  I still can't stand you.  And then as he talks, talking to his wife and he's like, didn't you represent, uh, his  brother's wife?  Oh yes, I do remember, um, her name, uh, Colleen and this, and I'm like, this is some 
[00:21:30]  fun conversation while I'm trying to eat.  You're talking about, uh, you know, which, what, which, who you, uh, represented as you  destroyed our lives.  They have this thing where to them it's just business, right?  No, it's not to me, but it's not.  It's like, of course they're, they, they like kind of write off their repulsive behavior  because they all behave that lawyers have to think in that mindset or else they, they'd  go crazy thinking everywhere they go, people hate them.  But, but lawyers, everywhere you go, people hate you.  They hate you. 
[00:22:00]  So, and then he wanted you to do his voice or something.  Yeah.  So he's leaving.  Cause I was just like, Hey, I'm eating.  And he goes, do the voice.  Do the, and he goes to his wife.  He does a great voice.  And I go, I'm not a performing seal.  Go.  Okay.  Take care.  Take care.  You've always been a gentleman.  Gentlemen.  Yuck.  Jesus Christ.  So then he showed up at the table after Howard left and I just yelled over there.  I go, I go, don't lose all my money. 
[00:22:30]  So that was, uh, that was a little excitement at the tables.  I did very well at blackjack.  Good.  Uh, that night.  You're not allowed to say anymore.  No, I won't say how well.  We used to have fun with that.  Cause you would tell us when you lost really badly and you would tell us when you won,  uh, extremely.  It was a pretty good win.  It was good.  And Danny had to just play with the, uh, money.  It was, um, it was, he just had to take it out and start playing with it because it  was just, uh, bricks that he, uh, enjoyed seeing in his hands. 
[00:23:00]  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just, you know, bricks.  What?  He took off his clothes and just dry humped them.  Yeah.  Bricks of hundreds.  So, uh, so that went well.  And then, uh, yeah, pretty much it.  Did you pass out in any fruit plates or any of that?  No, no, no.  I kept it pretty good.  I, uh, I had some beers, but nothing at the point where I passed out in a fruit plate.  Where's your liver at?  Are you all right with your liver? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  The liver feels good.  Still functioning.  I'm still functioning.  I'm just hoping it functions above 70%.  As long as it's above 70, is that good?  That's, yeah, as soon as it drops below 70, then we're gonna.  No shots, nothing like that.  I was drinking beer at the tables, but, um, I, I, I was getting up a lot and, uh, switching  tables and stuff like that.  So I really didn't have an opportunity to get completely hammered, which was good.  Um, yeah, it was just a, it was a, you know, good, fun weekend there at the, uh, Borgata.  Gotta thank them.  Like I said, they gave me a, a ridiculous suite. 
[00:24:00]  Um, huge.  It was like a frigging apartment.  Cause you're a whale.  And they sent a car all the way out to Long Island.  Wow.  A limo, uh, to drive us there and back.  Because you're a nice person?  Yeah.  Cause I'm a nice guy.  Okay.  They don't treat me that good.  And I work there.  Oh.  Cause you play the white chips, Jimmy.  Oh, they're, boy.  You gotta play the biggies.  They want their money back.  I'm a video poker guy, so.  Oh, wait.  Oh.  High stakes.  That limo's coming, Jimmy.  That limo's coming. 
[00:24:30]  You just stand outside and wait for it.  It'll be there.  They'll send an Ed's hold strapped to the roof.  There you go, douche.  I think it's hilarious that you're now considered a whale by these casinos.  It amazes me.  Yeah.  You're just a regular dude from Long Island used to put in air conditioners and now you're  a whale at casinos.  The only thing that was a little disappointing was, uh, uh, Marissa didn't call anyone the  C word.  No.  She got us thrown out of the casino last time.  Uh, but, uh, she said if she knew it was Dominic, uh, Barbara and his wife, she would have absolutely, 
[00:25:00]  uh, just called him the C word and the wife and everything else, which would have been  really funny.  I think you might've, you probably should have too.  Yeah.  I probably should have.  I mean, I just woke up and I was trying to eat.  We have to hear your rants from time to time.  I mean, the least you could do is to, you know, I can't, I can't really do that.  I can't really do that.  Uh, cause I don't know what kind of legal repercussions there would be in the, in the  courtroom.  In a casino?  I have no idea.  Have at it.  I just want this. 
[00:25:30]  I just want whatever litigation's going on now.  I want it over and done with.  And I want, uh, all those people out of my life.  That's all I want.  All right.  We got to do our first break.  We'll have more stories from, uh, Atlantic city with Anthony in a bit.  We got lots to do today, man.  Gary Coleman has, has been married for a while now since August and he still hasn't had sex  with his wife.  There's so much going on in the world, but that's the one, that's the one that just stands  out today.  Gary Coleman hasn't had sex with wife, even though they married in August when they're 
[00:26:00]  nose to nose, his toes is in it.  And when they're toes to toes, his nose is in it.  You got Fidel Castro resigning as president of Cuba.  That's, that's huge.  Are we coming in now and taking it over and making it into a nice resort or what?  I don't know what his brother in charge.  His brother was like the minister of defense for a while, so I'm sure he's not some soft  guy.  But isn't this the day we've been waiting for since we can remember?  As soon as Castro's out, we're taking the place over?  I think we would like to, you know, open up a little more diplomatic relations with Cuba 
[00:26:30]  and this might be a good opportunity.  I think the United States always wanted to shove it in Castro's face that we're not doing  any business with you, but anybody else that gets in there, we're willing to talk to.  So we'll see.  He just looks awful.  He's this frail old guy who can barely walk.  So yeah, he's probably gonna be dropping dead soon.  Maybe they'll wait till then.  I don't know.  But all right, we'll get more on that.  Also, we got some of those Cuban cigars.  That'd be nice.  We got Jimmy's audio. 
[00:27:00]  We'll play that after the break.  Not a time.  We'll have to mule him in up certain orifices.  One cigar, two, three.  How many can you fit?  A bundle.  A bundle of cigars.  Just married Massachusetts.  Here's a whole box with plenty of room for lighters.  Cigars and a Cuban behind you.  Smuggling him in.  Also, a reality show in a lot of trouble because one of the reality stars is just being realistic. 
[00:27:30]  Just being a guy talking like people talk.  We'll explain that after the break.  And of course, it's Michael Madsen Day.  One day and one day only.  So hopefully we'll have some more Michael Madsen clips after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  Hey, this is Michael Madsen.  You're listening to my pal, little Jimmy Norton.  He's not really my pal.  I've never met the guy in my life.  Man, people got to keep it real out there.  Keep it real. 
[00:28:00]  Ralph from Belleville.  He writes in all the time, too.  But he just doesn't listen closely.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show, by the way.  The instant feedback is up on our website that we can't promote.  That is named after this show.  Indeed.  That's the one we read.  ONAradio.com.  And they have a feedback, I believe, but it's not linked to the one we read, if that makes sense.  None at all.  Okay.  If you want, you know, us to read your feedbacks, go to the website we cannot promote and find that link. 
[00:28:30]  Ralph writes, that's it, Anthony.  Kiss Michael Madsen's ass.  And Rip Howard, the man you and Opie owe your whole careers to.  What?  Was that guy listening?  Where did Anthony rip into Howard with that Atlantic City story?  Did I rip into him?  You made fun of him a little bit because he was walking around with 20 white chips worth...  20 bucks.  20 dollars.  Jesus.  You'd make fun of anyone for that. 
[00:29:00]  The guy's got a pretty big contract.  I think he could afford to bump it up, maybe.  I don't know.  That's pretty much the only shot Anthony took at him in that entire story he just told.  Everything else I said, he was very nice, very cordial.  That wasn't even a shot.  That was just a funny line.  Yeah.  What the hell are you talking about?  Anyone who hears us just mention his name and they assume we're bashing him, so...  Screw him.  Yeah.  All right.  Speaking of Michael Madsen, we got the chicken story.  Oh, the chicken story. 
[00:29:30]  We decided to make it Michael Madsen Tuesday.  Just one Tuesday, one Tuesday only.  And that Tuesday would be today.  We had him on.  The dude from Reservoir Dogs.  You know, the famous torture scene.  Yeah.  He's been in a million movies.  The Getaway.  Kill Bill.  Yep.  Free Willy.  Great.  Free Willy.  Well, I like a cup of tea.  I thought he was great in Donnie Brosco, yeah.  Donnie Brosco, very good.  And he was just a great interview on Friday.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  We really enjoyed our time with him, and so we're just going to replay a few clips.  Just a few Michael Madsen things.  This is the chicken story he told on Friday.  It's quick.  Made some great movies, yeah.  Yeah, he sure did.  I know his godson, Joseph Culp.  He's Robert Culp's son.  Oh, yeah?  He told me some good Peckinpah stories, yeah.  He told me that when they did, when they were doing Wild Bunch, that at a lunch break, Ben  Johnson and Bill, and I guess they took some chickens and they buried them in the ground with 
[00:30:30]  only their heads sticking out of the dirt.  Jesus.  And then they were all get back with their rifles, and they were going to take a target  shot and see who could blow their heads off.  But the chickens, when they're buried in the ground, they go like they fell asleep.  Their heads just go like this, like they're dead.  And they just fall asleep.  And they're like, oh, man, this ain't going to be no fun.  They're going to pop their heads off, but they're sleeping.  You know, this isn't right, right?  That isn't right.  If they're not clucking, that's perfectly fine. 
[00:31:00]  But sleeping, that's not right.  So apparently, Mr. Peckinpah.  Jesus Christ.  Apparently Sam, Sam Peckinpah, apparently him, or maybe it was Warren Oates, one of the  two of them apparently went over to the sleeping chickens and squirted Zippo lighter fluid on  all their heads.  Oh, my God.  It woke them up, yeah.  And they were awake then, man. 
[00:31:30]  And then, I guess then the shooting began.  It's just amazing.  What a sick, sick story.  Seems like one of those stories you would keep to yourself, but God bless Michael Madsen.  Sam Peckinpah, Warren Oates, or one of them just took some Zippo lighter fluid to their  heads.  Everyone was drunk, I don't know.  Yeah, yeah, we were all drinking whiskey.  I was drunk when I was told the story, so I don't even know if this is true anymore.  There you go. 
[00:32:00]  Sam Peckinpah.  Michael Madsen.  Right on.  A nut.  So, the big news today, obviously, Castro stepping down, resigning.  This is what we know so far.  After nearly half a century, as ruler of Cuba, Fidel Castro has stepped down.  The announcement was made early this morning.  The 81-year-old ailing president writing in the online edition of the Daily Communist newspaper  waiver that he would not accept a new term when the newly elected parliament meets on 
[00:32:30]  Sunday.  This effectively ends the controversial communist leader's reign of power, positioning his 76-year-old  brother, Raul, for permanent succession to the presidency.  Uh, 76 the brother is?  I mean...  I wouldn't use 76 and permanent in the same sentence.  Yeah.  Yeah, maybe, uh...  I would use temporarily.  We've waited this long.  We could wait a little while longer for that guy to drop off, too.  You know, they promised us that all hell would break loose when this day came.  But, uh, yeah, that ain't gonna happen. 
[00:33:00]  I mean, let's go!  Let's go!  Boy, that guy has seen some, uh, world leaders come and go, though.  Yeah.  Castro.  Yeah.  He just sat there, uh, alone in the world after the Soviet Union fell.  That's it.  He didn't have any big allies or anything.  He just sat there, a pretty independent nation.  Except for, you know, stupid Canada getting in there and helping him out a little bit.  But, uh, yeah, Cuban cigars.  That's all. 
[00:33:30]  Do we get the...  Let's start exporting them, Cuba.  But aren't we starting to make, uh, good ones ourselves, finally?  Nah, nothing's like a Cuban cigar, you know.  But how do you know for sure?  I've smoked Cuban cigars.  They're great.  But have you smoked the good stuff that they're making in, uh, the States now?  In the U.S.?  Yeah.  Not recently, no.  That's right.  So those Rochester cigars are delicious.  Oh, it's the perfect climate for, uh, growing cigars.  Here it is.  Growing them like they just grow.  Yeah, it's a cigar tree.  You pick them and smoke them.  Yeah, let's go to Jeremy in Cleveland. 
[00:34:00]  Jeremy in Cleveland.  What's up, Jeremy?  Welcome to the airwaves, b-b-b-boys.  Thank you.  Yeah, it kind of sucks that we've been, uh, in afternoons for two years.  And today they're welcoming us to the airwaves in Cleveland.  Because we're now live in, uh, mornings.  Up in Cleveland.  Well, we missed you at first, so.  I'm sorry, guys.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  I wanted to tell little Jimmy I'll see him here in two weeks, and I have a present for him.  Oh, thank you.  What's the present for Jimmy?  Uh, Black Sabbath wall poster. 
[00:34:30]  Um, it's the fabric poster, not the paper poster.  Okay, thanks, man.  Thank you.  I will be walking up to you in a wild hat, handing it to you in a paper bag.  Not our Bud Dwyer, I do think.  Thanks, buddy.  Jesus.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  I already yelled die and then hand this to you.  Yeah.  I'm Jack Ruby.  Here's a poster.  Apparently a transcript of that Jack Ruby conversation with Oswald.  No.  Yeah.  Sounds realistic.  Yeah.  And I'll shoot him.  Oh, that's good.  I'm sure that's what happened.  And I'll shoot you, Lee Harvey. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, well, that's what people talk.  Leave the gun with the print on it, Ruby.  Ruby.  What's the deal?  Old files?  They didn't go, or old safes or old file cabinets, they didn't go through until just recently?  Just recently.  And found, like, just tons of stuff that had something to do with the assassination.  Mm-hmm.  That, what, links Ruby and, what does it do, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I haven't even read the conversation.  They said that Oswald and Ruby had never met prior to Ruby shooting Oswald. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  And these transcripts are supposed to link them together beforehand within two weeks of the assassination, talking and having a conversation.  And the transcript says something like, Lee Harvey Oswald says that we can get to, they wanted to get to, not JFK, they wanted to get to Bobby Kennedy.  Uh, and Oswald said, well, there are other ways to get to him, uh, you know, shooting his brother. 
[00:36:00]  Obviously, the president.  Uh, and Ruby said something, um, and then Oswald asked, are you in the mafia?  And Ruby said, you're asking too many questions.  And this is audio tape?  No, it's, it's transcripts on a piece of paper.  It could be written by anybody.  Yeah, aren't they saying, but aren't they saying it could have been for a movie they were thinking of making?  Yes, it's, there's no, uh, absolute proof that this is what took place or any conversation that took place. 
[00:36:30]  And transcript from what?  Like, what did it come from?  Yeah, a what, a phone conversation, a recording?  Um, they weren't very clear on that.  I was watching the stupid, you know, Channel 11 news.  They had to go to a puppy surfing story or some crap like that.  Right.  Did Oswald bring a stenographer to the meeting with Ruby?  Yes.  By killing Bobby Kennedy?  Could you read that back to me, please, miss?  Shoot him in the kitchen.  End.  Unbelievable.  All right, hey, uh, moving back to Jimmy. 
[00:37:00]  So Jimmy, uh, spent Valentine's Day in San Francisco and we got actual audio of your Valentine's Day.  Yes, this is Valentine's Day night.  I had to get up very early the next morning and do press to promote the gig.  And, um, this is Valentine's Day evening.  In the hotel.  Okay.  In the hotel.  Oh, that hurts. 
[00:37:30]  What the hell?  That's the fish?  Yeah.  Oh, I was swimming upstream.  I'm a fingers down the throat guy and I kept getting up and having to go and I felt  like it was going to come up.  Like, it was going to happen sooner or later.  So that was just.  That last one was great. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, listen to you be bulimic, basically.  Just.  Well, yeah, but it would necessarily so.  Yeah, but you had to.  I understand that.  I was generally sick.  Wow.  And this was before the, all the big shows in San Francisco.  I probably, I was up four or five times.  I just recorded a couple of them and I just was, I was vomiting horribly.  Here's another clip.  Sound like a lamb. 
[00:38:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, pray for me. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow.  That was a, that was a clip actually from Jimmy's new film, Slap Happy. 
[00:39:30]  You're in that one.  I got a video of it.  I'll show you the video.  Oh.  You just rolled tape, man.  Bravo.  You make some great puke sounds.  Oh, Rachel.  Rachel.  Wow.  The fish came up and everything else.  Oh, it really, I, the whole taste of my mouth too.  You know how when you ever, when you get sick, there's one piece of it.  Oh.  Yeah.  It wasn't fish. 
[00:40:00]  It was a creamy sauce that would have been good, like originally, like a pasta sauce.  Well, mixed with bile and whatnot.  Not good.  You should never order anything with a cream sauce on a plane.  Really?  That's the last thing you have to worry about is making sure that creamy thing is kept refrigerated.  Seriously.  Yeah.  Something happened.  They left it out on the tarmac a little while.  Well, you know what?  I think you're right.  Yeah.  It just sits on the tarmac and waiting to be loaded into the plane. 
[00:40:30]  Do you know what I mean?  Ah.  Ah.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  All right.  Hold on.  We can do a little something.  I wish I didn't flush it that one time.  That was such a good noise.  I happened to flush right after, though.  No.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.

[00:47:30]  he didn't want to hear that  he just wanted to sit there  and just BS about  Hollywood  and what  what jackasses people are  and yeah  did a great job  so alright  moving on  we got some  controversy  Big Brother  no  I gave up on Big Brother  a while ago  I never thought it would  go past one season here  is that show still doing well  I have no idea  I have a really good friend  that won the whole thing  well  we met because 
[00:48:00]  he came in to promote  Big Brother Eddie  oh right  one legged Eddie  is still a friend of mine  to this day  I didn't know they were  still doing the show though  but he came in  we hit it off  and he's a Long Island guy  and we keep in touch  here and there  over the last  bunch of years  anyway  the latest installment  of Big Brother  there's an autism group  that's really mad  and they're demanding  an apology  wow  of course  they're demanding  an apology  for something  that was said  on a reality show  yeah  reality show 
[00:48:30]  yeah  it's a reality show  when you have a reality show  people are going to say  bad things  that's the real part of it  people talk like this  in real life  they demand an apology  demand  a national autism  advocacy group  is demanding an apology  from CBS  over a disparaging remark  a contestant  on the reality show  Big Brother  made about people  with the disorder  John Gilmore  executive director  of Autism United  said Monday  that his group  has been trying 
[00:49:00]  to speak with CBS  executives  since last week's broadcast  and he stood in a corner  looked at the wall  for 10 hours  on that episode  a contestant  named Adam  who claimed  to work for  an autism foundation  said he would  spend his winnings  on a hair salon  for people  with developmental  disabilities  so retards  can get it together  and get their hair done  his partner  Sheila told him  don't call them that  Adam responded  disabled kids  I can call them  whatever I want  I work with them  all day 
[00:49:30]  okay  doesn't he figure  that the hole  would jump in  don't call them that  it's a noble idea  he wants to help  get a better haircut  hairstyles  for the retarded  they need it  the parents are awful  they'd give them  that one haircut  we've talked about it  800,000 times  right  so Jimmy  what do you think  oh I think  he should apologize  yes  that's what I saw  and called for  indeed  he should be  very sorry  it's people  people talk like this  reality shows suck 
[00:50:00]  I  there's not one  I watch  with any  passion  I don't sit there  going oh I gotta  catch it this week  nothing  and American Idol  was big  remember that  I used to watch  American Idol  from the beginning  to the end  I knew it was  happening every step  of the way  this season  I could give  a crap  I don't know  one person  you could not  possibly even tell  me one person  I don't know  there's controversy 
[00:50:30]  with one of the broads  I wouldn't even know  she had a record deal  back in 2001  and they want her  kicked off  because of that  but the rules  state that  you can't be in  a record contract  as you're trying  out for the show  so it's right there  in the rules  so she's fine  but there's a lot  of controversy  over her  because I guess  she almost made it  as a singer already  I don't know  but what I love  about these reality shows  as soon as they look  into their past  and they find  some kind of  dumb charge  some stupid  drunk driving charge  or something  then they pull them  off the reality show 
[00:51:00]  domestic abuse  maybe a murder  let them play  you have to have  a clean record  to be on a reality show  that's so  that's so ridiculous  to me  well here's the actual  actual audio  from Big Brother  that they're having  a problem with here  let's take a quick listen  now I do PR  I work for  you know  I'm not doing  the foundation  I'm quite good stuff  I'm doing  I'm going to get some money  I'm going to do  a hair salon  for kids with special needs  you know what I'm saying  so the retards  can get it together  and get their hair done  you know what I mean  don't call me 
[00:51:30]  disabled kids  I can call  whatever I want  I work all day long  I can call  whatever I want  I'm not saying  anything offensive  right or wrong bro  never  I've talked with  plenty of people  that work with  developmentally  disabled  children  and adults  and  all they do  is speak  poorly of them  on the job  they're very nice  they're doing their job 
[00:52:00]  they're doing what  they gotta do  but when they're done  they're just like  oh god damn retards  you know that's  human nature  and CBS already  knows that  what are you a saint  you have to like  get off of work  and still  talk about them  and praise them  no they're a pain  in the ass  to deal with  they're crapping  themselves  you gotta clean it up  doing things that  monkeys do  in the corner  for the most part  no one likes  their job  so of course  they would talk  badly about it  after they leave  but CBS already  knew that  it was bad 
[00:52:30]  yeah  you are hearing  something  controversial  they wanted  to make  something of it  that dramatic  without the music  it was a passing  line  right  well it's just  showing that  they don't have  balls  no  they knew that  it was controversial  and they're like  alright how do we  how do we acknowledge  this is controversial  we'll go into  the dramatic  music library  and get something  underneath this  so people know  that we know 
[00:53:00]  that this is not good  right  Sheila didn't like it  what  Sheila didn't like it  Sheila  don't say that  they're saying  that this comment  by the way  is just as bad  as I am  is  ah  is it  hopefully  I'm thinking  that now that  the floodgates  floodgates  now that the  floodgates are open  and everyone's  going to be  complaining about  every single  little thing  that happens  on a radio show  or a TV show  this is finally 
[00:53:30]  the pushback  people are going  to be like  alright enough  who cares  exactly  just shut up  now  shut up  we want to  watch shows  enough  I was just  looking at  some of the  phone calls  about haircuts  let's say  hi to Jared  in Boston  Jared  sure this  will be  tolerant  Boston  you gotta  drown them  like kittens  when they  young  you throw  them off 
[00:54:00]  the Tobin  if this guy  gives them  all haircuts  how are our  soldiers going  to tell  which ones  are the  suicide  bombers  ah  nice  oh yes  they are  using  using the  retarded  yes  well we  learned that  a couple  weeks ago  now right  yeah  let's say  hi to  Raquel  Queens  what's going  on Raquel  how you doing  I just wanted  to point out  that the  acronym  for National  Associate  Advocate  Group  pretty much 
[00:54:30]  spells out  NAG  you know  oh NAGRA  please  punching out  guys  ah  too late  ah yeah  that would be  see  for new people  listening  punching out  is a term  used by  fighter pilots  pilots  when they're  ejecting  from their  craft  as it's  plummeting  toward the  earth  right  so a lot  of times  when somebody  has a real  bad  story going  they'll go  ah forget it  I'm punching  out  and they  punch out  they eject  from their 
[00:55:00]  joke  which is  the plane  and live  live to call  another day  but when you  say I'm  punching out  after you've  already left  a crater  full of  smoldering  aluminum  and fuel  it's done  you didn't  punch out  you went  down with  your craft  like the  great  Santini  you know  we've been  holding on  to something  we didn't  know what  to do  with it  and now  we have  a perfect  slot  to play  it  this thing  we gave  the people  a little  taste

[01:00:30]  you've got  to have  some kind  of gallows  humor  you know  it's like  what cops  or firemen  do  when you're  working in  that environment  there's going  to be things  that are  going to  strike you  as funny  and you  share them  with co-workers  and stuff  like that  but you  don't  you know  you're still  treating the  people with  respect  and helping  them out  you're not  doing it  to their  face  or anything  like that  and they  wouldn't  understand  anyway  and we  also have  we have  kids that  one kid  dresses up  like a  pirate  we have  another kid  who  anytime 
[01:01:00]  he sees  a girl  he strangely  wants to  drink her  blood  we've got  a kid  who takes  kids  in the middle  of a  classroom  like  you can't  go through  a whole  day  and not  find humor  in this  stuff  because otherwise  you're going  to start  beating them  what is the  pirate going  to do  is he going  to raid  the gene pool  remove all  the good ones  throw them  overboard  walk the  plank  thank you  let's go to  bricktown  it's mike  what's up  mike  hey  what's going  on  hey man  I just wanted  to say one  thing  they always 
[01:01:30]  talk about  all this  stuff  you know  in movies  and people  saying the  wrong thing  but what  about the  ringer  there was a  whole movie  dedicated to  don't even  get me started  about the  ringer  man  yeah it was  a good movie  though right  no no no  I'll tell you  what hold on  hold on  I know  something about  the ringer  so Johnny  Knoxville makes  this movie  the ringer  right and  he was going  to compete  in the  special olympics  because he was  down on his  luck and he  needed to pay  some bills  so he gets  this great  idea with  his uncle  he goes  look I'm  going to  make believe  I'm retarded  and I'm  going to get  in the  special olympics  and I'm  gonna win 
[01:02:00]  and I'm  like holy  crap this is  going to be  a hilarious  movie  you got  Johnny  Knoxville  it's a  great  concept  this is  what they  did with  the stupid  ringer  and this  is how  they're  trying to  get around  the PC  crap  the special  olympics  endorsed the  movie  it worked  hand in  hand with  Johnny  Knoxville  why would  Johnny  Knoxville  agree to  this  crap  it was  such a  great  idea  for a  movie  and it  was ruined  because they  got the  special olympics  involved  like you  can make  fun of  this but  you can't  make fun  of that  they're  sensitive  to this 
[01:02:30]  issue but  they're  okay with  this and  it just  completely  ruined  what could  have been  a good  movie  the joke  safe  very safe  Jimmy  and they  made them  the stars  and it  was just  like I  was so  disappointed  I'm like  Johnny  Knoxville  what are  you doing  man  you took  a bullet  in the  desert  did they  yeah  did they  show them  a lot  of them  smiling  I like  when they  do that  when they  smile  victory at  the end  yay  it was  yay  it's like  the orangutan 
[01:03:00]  in every which  way but  loose  big smile  but not quite  as smart  they were  all included  they were  all included  in the fun  they were  all included  in the fun  and that  takes away  from comedy  if you know  anything about  comedy  you can't  include  everybody  someone  must  get it  on the  receiving  end  Mike I'm  glad you  brought that  up  because  one movie 
[01:03:30]  drives me  nuts  and I'm  glad it  bombed  because then  we'd have  more movies  where they  include  the special  interest  groups  to make  sure  all the  groups  are happy  or all  the people  are happy  everyone  everyone  just calm  down  let us  make fun  of the  disadvantaged  right  all right  hey we're  starting our  oscar moments  when are the  oscars by the  way  anyone know  we got another  week or two  that's another 
[01:04:00]  thing I have  no idea  I have  completely  lost touch  with any  type of  crappy  television  I don't  care about  and it's  all because  of DVRs  DVRs have  made it so  easy  and a  gambling  habit  well you  know that  too  I don't  I don't  go to the  casino a lot  I thank  god there  isn't one  next door to  my house  yeah  but  well the  answer would  be sunday  is the  oscars  sunday  ah 
[01:04:30]  okay  five days  that would be  sunday  iraq thank  you for  saying actually  after I said  it would be  sunday  don't  anyone else  pick up on  that mic  that was good  iraq never  put that  mic in  but anyone  pick up  on that  I said  oscars  are sunday  and iraq  he helps  the program  by going  actually  it's five  days  from now  five days  ah  that would  be  sunday  next time  say 120  hours  it's easier  so we're  doing a little  oscar moments  because we had  some success

[01:09:30]  Friday  now I gotta  talk to you  about that  because before  the movie  comes out  they gotta  fix that  title  because it's  supposed to be  witness right  you spelt it  wrong and that's  gonna get people  confused  yeah well  now who are you  again  no it is  it's Witless  Protection  Witless Protection  that's right  and what is the  basis of this  movie  you know what  this is  I'm a small town  sheriff and I  want to be an  FBI agent 
[01:10:00]  and Ivana  Lechevich is  my co-star  and she was  at Hot  Looking Blonde  in Casino  Royale  that tried to  pull you  oh yeah  oh yeah  yeah  and it's  been a ton  of stuff  anyway she's  in the witness  protection program  she stops in  my town  she has to  use the bathroom  of course she's  surrounded by  FBI agents  I right away  think she's been  kidnapped by  somebody not  knowing she's in  the witness  protection program  so I kidnap  her from the  FBI and they  are actually  trying to get  her back from  me and I'm  trying to keep  them away from 
[01:10:30]  them so  and something  tells me you're  the witless  part  I'm the witless  part but I  have to tell you  this movie's  great I mean  the stars in  it are great  got Yafet Kodo  in it  Eric Roberts  Peter Stamari  Jenny McCarthy  is my girlfriend  in the thing  very believable  Joe yeah  isn't that right  every time I see  a good looking  girl with a  big fat white  guy I always  consider her a  hostage and call  the police  you know what 
[01:11:00]  I mean  and then  Joe Mantegna  is in it  oh no  Eric Roberts  actually came  out of retirement  or not  Eric Roberts  Yafet Kodo  told me he  came out of  retirement  the script  was so funny  he said he  wanted to do  another movie  this first movie  he's done  he's done  like 400  films  yeah  whatever  huge  so he came  out to do  that's awesome  yeah it's  really I'm  excited about it  it'd be pretty  good  yeah witless  do that  and then you  screwed up the  other title  it's Delta  Force  but then 
[01:11:30]  you see what  I'm doing  with my movies  I'm switching  the little one  letter  and that's the  comedy of the  title  I got you  now  now at least  I know  I do it for  the critics  because they're  gonna they always  hammer me anyway  so I just  gotta save them  sometimes  so I  because I  already see it  witless protection  is witless  and it's fine  you know  they give you a  bad time  the critics  no  for God  I don't really  read the reviews  well you know  what  yeah  I mean  they don't  like 
[01:12:00]  the title  the title  says it all  witless  alright  it's funny  they never  like what I  do  but yet  I sell  2-3 million  DVDs  you know  what I mean  so  like  whatever  I don't  do movies  for critics  anyway  so who  cares  I just  gotta keep  my fans  happy  you do  it for  Oscar  well  exactly  I've been  screwed  out of that  thing three  times  now did  you see  Rambo  well  we should  have  because we  talked to  Sylvester  Stallone  and we  never went  and saw  it  was it  good  it was  good  I heard 
[01:12:30]  it was  pretty good  I sat  in the  second row  I said  so close  I think  I actually  saw his  face move  he looks  like Paul  Stanley  now  doesn't he  he's got  the big  Rambo  hair  he's got  a bit  of the  Botox  I think  he had  the same  guy  that  Kenny  Rogers  had  when he  had  oh  yeah  Kenny Rogers  didn't even  look like  Kenny Rogers  anymore  he looks  like a plate  of his own  chicken  I don't know  what the hell  happened to that  guy  now I guess 
[01:13:00]  Jessica Alba's  got a movie  coming out  called The  Eye  and I don't  know about you  but if I was  making a movie  about Jessica  Alba's body  parts  I'd be going  through a lot  of secrets  when I got  to the eyeballs  I put  Brown  in front  of  it  and then  he got  a hit  on your  head  tell me  she wouldn't  make a  jerk  a little  slack  out of  the rope  that girl  right there  I tell you  so knowing  a lot  about  Lyra  the cable  guy  I would  have to  assume  that you're  voting for  Obama  the upcoming  election  you mean  Osama  that's 
[01:13:30]  the middle  name  ain't it  yeah  you know  what I gotta  tell you  I've been  so out  of  I've been  working  too much  this year  I get  bored  with all  that  they've  been running  I thought  Super Tuesday  was 99 cents  off two tacos  I really  did  it has  been tiring  it really  has been  but I always  thought  Hillary running  good lord  if I wanted  somebody with  boobs in  a white  house  I'd have 
[01:14:00]  voted for  Bill Richardson  he had  some teddies  on him  now  Mitt Romney  what about  the Mitt  what a name  Mitt  what's that  guy do  sleep oiled  up  folded in  half  under a  pillow  that's a  weird name  for president  he's gotta  be broken  in after  he becomes  president  he's gotta  sit there  and hit  him for  a while  he's got  the oil  in his  hair  that you  would  usually  deserve  for the  Mitt  right  and then 
[01:14:30]  Ron Paul  he was a  gynecologist  no really  before he  ever did  any  so when  he says  he has  a unique  view  on things  he really  does  take that  to the  banquet  but yeah  I really  haven't  gotten it  I mean  how am I  going to  hibernation  for four  years  I asked  that because  a new  Hillary song  came in  today  and we  want to  get your  opinion  yeah  we've been  listening to  a lot of  these  support songs  for the  candidates  rah rah  you know  they really  like going  out and 
[01:15:00]  playing these  songs  and this  one could  possibly be  the worst  one I've  ever heard  I might  have heard  it but  let's hear  it  we started  playing it  during the  break we  only played  the first  20 seconds  we just  started laughing  wait a minute  was that  thing I  heard that  theme  to say  that's a  Hillary song  yes  I thought  someone just  redid the  song from  the show  oh  yeah we  could say  it doesn't  wreck the  bit  you don't  wanna  I would 
[01:15:30]  just  play it  no  I didn't  know what  it was  it was so  awful  I went  from yuck  to just  started laughing  it's so  uncontrollably  just embarrassing  and I'm laughing  at the song  at the person  singing it  I don't think  it's funny  I wanna hear the  words man  listen to this  the new  Hillary song  one two  three four  five six  two thousand  deep  Wisconsin  Ohio  Texas  and on to  Penn State  she's gonna  do it  give her  just a chance  she'll make it  oh 
[01:16:00]  god  she's gonna  do it  if she  quit doing  stuff like  that she  might actually  be leading  in the  polls  you know  yeah  that is  awful  it's hilarious  it starts  off  like how the  states go  in  yeah  one two  three  98  it sounds  like  2008  whatever year  it is  it sounds  like a  tranny  singing it  first of  all  it doesn't  really  tiny  ten  right  it's out of  a Jim J  Bullock  singing it  and then she 
[01:16:30]  breaks into  that old  SNL  singing bit  yeah  it kicks  in  all right  let's try  to get past  the first part  one two  three  four  the tranny  Wisconsin  Ohio  Texas  and on  to Penn State  she's gonna  do it  give her  just a chance  she'll make it  any glass  feeling  she'll break it  she's gonna  be your  president  Hillary Clinton  nothing's gonna  turn her back 
[01:17:00]  now  straight ahead  can't just  use the real  words  to make  our dreams  come true  exactly  the big  ragu  should just  slide in  singing the  c-word  at the top  of his voice  and you know  but the thing  that's funny  about it  you know  there's gonna  be some  people actually  going oh  what a  great  and they're  gonna buy  20 copies  of course  and give it  to the  relatives  Hillary Clinton  there is  nothing  she can do 
[01:17:30]  really  how about  keeping her  husband  from getting  a little  action in  the Oval  Office  putting some  shape onto  her legs  she's gonna  do it  on your  market set  and vote  now  gotta dream  and got  the know  how  with plans  to make  our dreams  come true  working for  us all day  yes all day  make all our  dreams come true 
[01:18:00]  working for us  all day  yes all day  make all our  dreams come true  for me and  you  what do you  think  good  what do you  think  the worst  song I've  ever heard  it's not though  because it makes  you laugh  because that  voice she's  really working  it  give her a  chance  she'll make  it 
[01:18:30]  that's right  oh  yeah that was  pretty scary  there's nothing  she can't do  really  wow there's a few  things she can't  you think she  can't do  yeah  touch her toes  it's probably  one  I like how she  says that she's  in it'll be a  different White  House than when  her husband was  in which means  instead of a  receiving White  House it'll be a  giving White  wow that's  crazy  that's terrific  I don't know 
[01:19:00]  part of me wants  her in there just  because I want to  see Bill as  kind of the  first lady  hang out with  the broads  from other  from other  countries  yeah he has to  sit in the  tea room  and hang out  with the wives  of the other  presidents  how are they  going to rework  that if she  gets in there  and it's not  the type of  women he wants  to be hanging  out with  old broads  that are married  to other  freaking  old lesbians  that's pretty  much it  I think people  that vote for  her really  think that I  think they're  going to vote  for her but  secretly they  think he's 
[01:19:30]  going to be  running it  makes them  feel a little  more comfortable  he doesn't  care though  he'll just  get in there  and be like  I don't care  I'm just  going to walk  around give  tours  this is where  I used to  work  this is where  the wife  works  he can  pick them  when they  come through  the door  that's a good  chance for him  to get laid  up  it could be  like a rock  concert where  they point out  to the security  he'll go down  there hey  when's the tour  coming through  let me know  tell her I 
[01:20:00]  want a little  secret tour  for her  I'm going  to show  her the  Lincoln  bedroom  what about  McCain  do you think  he's too  old  he scares  the crap  out of me  he seems  like the  kind of guy  that would  get pissed  and make  the whole  country  sit in the  corner  but he  had a  colon check  and they  found an  arrowhead  so I  don't  know  his watch  is still  set to  hammer time  he had  his arm  broken so  many times  you can't  raise his  arms over  his head  which is  commendable  but it's  like just  stop doing  it on  TV 
[01:20:30]  how's he  going to  do that  peace sign  thing  when he  gets into  the Air  Force One  it's going  to be  half up  pointing at  people with  two fingers  Frankenstein  he looks  like a  midget  wrestler  he did  do a  funny thing  on Conan  last night  he come  out and  they had  him doing  like you  know  just stupid  stuff  he was  pretty funny  yeah he had  a sense of  humor  he's got a  good sense  of humor  it's got to  be rough  to have a  sense of  humor  when for  six years 
[01:21:00]  you've just  been beaten  by some  Vietnamese  people  maybe that's  why he's got  a sense of  humor  yeah  something's got  to keep  you there  now have you  been watching  American Idol  we were just  talking about how  we usually do  but this year  I watched  every year  and now this  year I just  had it  a peak  year  dude I thought  I was watching  the Special  Olympics  when I was  watching it  after the third  singer I had  my checkbook  out  where's the  scroll  I was trying  to help  them people  send your  contributions 
[01:21:30]  I won't  watch  because that's  Simon says  the meanest  things  oh Jimmy  he's the best  part of the  show  have you seen  that CMT  reality show  that would be  something to do  with country  no  no  they get all  these people  from different  avenues of music  to try to turn  them into country  singers  and none of  them can do  it the only  person that's  really caught  on kind of  the country  thing is Bobby  Brown  he's already  learned how to  smoke crack  out of a  corn cob  pipe  he's the 
[01:22:00]  only one  that's got  on to it  he's already  got the  wife beating  thing down  so he's  close  yeah he's  not doing  bad  actually I  heard that  show's pretty  good  it's a bunch  of what's  celebrities  from other  walks of life  trying to be  country singers  right  yeah Bobby  Brown  Marsha  Brady  and  Marsha  Brady  we met  her in LA  years ago  and she  was already  trying to be  a country  singer  so I  wasn't  panning  out  she  went down  to Nashville  and all  that crap  well she  hasn't  aged well  no no  she looked  good up  until about  I guess  10 years  ago  maybe  and then  really took 
[01:22:30]  a turn  when we met  her for the  first time  she looked  really good  yeah she  looked good  we were  surprisingly  surprisingly  no not so  good  they ought to  get that  thing that's  on Maury  Povich  that likes  to sing  country  the conjoined  twin  the girls  that are  connected  by the head  and one  of them  is a  country  singer  and the  other  one  doesn't  like  country  and they  dye their  hair  different  colors  and meanwhile  it looks  like one  of those  houses  where the  house is  connected  but it's  a duplex  so the  siding is  different  on two  houses  one guy  wanted a 
[01:23:00]  brown house  one guy  wanted a  white house  that's  what her  head looks  like  even worse  so one  guy wants  something  like a  pink house  it doesn't  look good  that's what  they look  like  just as  awful  with one  big eye  in between  they're our  favorite people  there  Larry  Larry the  cable guy  in the  studio  today  I have  some  tweets  for Larry  by the  way  the 21st  February 21st  Redding  Pennsylvania  at the  Sovereign  Center  Arena  the 22nd  Erie  Pennsylvania  Erie  Erie  Civic

[01:29:00]  refuses to die  so let's say  hi to Tom  Tom what's going  on  I mean we were  trying to do  the right thing  we started this  bit called  is Tom Alive  Friday  I don't know  a year ago  I think  and he's still  hanging on  he was on  death's door  one foot in the  grave the other  on a skateboard  and he's just  hanging in  we felt like  we thought it  would be a great  bit  follow this guy  as he dies  within the next  few months  and we had to 
[01:29:30]  give up  that's hilarious  I mean that's  a good bit  but as a radio  show we actually  had to sit  around and go  you know what  we gotta drop  the Tom is Alive  bit because he  won't die  Hyman Ross  you're gonna learn  that Tom was  making the whole  thing is what  you're gonna learn  well Tom  what do you got  today buddy  a couple things  I want to say  hi to Larry  what's going on  Tommy  he only has a  few minutes  so let's go  are you talking  about Tom  well  huh 
[01:30:00]  well I'm  getting ready  I'm having  some problems  so  you know  it started  in July  yeah I do  what happened  I'm having  some  problems  with  my  neuromuscular  and  I thought  it was lung  problems  well  it's  it can  involve  any organ  it's in  my lungs  and my  heart  oh boy  it's also  in my 
[01:30:30]  spinal cord  so basically  what you're  seeing is  this bit's  almost over  it's almost  over  yeah  that's  yeah  I have  I'm cleaning  the gun  oh are you  because he said  when it gets  to the point  where he really  can't function  anymore  he's just  gonna end  it  he's gonna  he's not  gonna sit  there and  be a burden  sorry Larry  you shouldn't  be laughing  I shouldn't  be laughing  I keep  thinking it's  set up  but Larry's  got a great 
[01:31:00]  sense of humor  about it  he's you know  been a part  of the program  for a while  now  of course  he did  Larry's  called into  many many  morning shows  over the years  he started  that way  way back  in the day  I mean  this is a  good bit  right  you can  understand  a good radio  bit  yeah darn  right  and let me  tell you  something  he's got  a good  that's the  cool thing  about him  he's got  a good  sense of  humor  about him  I mean  that's what  that's why  he's living  longer and  longer  because he's  got a good  sense of  humor about  it  and he  knows what's  up  the creepy  part  one day  though 
[01:31:30]  he's gonna  you know  well I hope  he don't do  that  well he said  he is  right Tom  yeah  Tom now  Tom don't  do that  just get  you  I tell you  what  get you  a bunch  of Baywatch  stuff  just go out  with a  Baywatch  marathon  that'd be  nice  it gets  him  I guess  he's a  lot of  pain  does that  suck  yeah  yeah  a lot  of pain  a lot  of discomfort  yeah  he's uncomfortable  I think  and then just  the fact that  you really  can't do 
[01:32:00]  anything  that you  used to  enjoy doing  because  you know  Larry  you're  distracting  us  we're doing  our big  is Tom  alive  interview  here  and you're  just  very  uncomfortable  over there  Larry's too  big for this  bit I think  I make no  comment on  that  he's doing  Regis and  Kelly right  after this  he's got to  leave him  like near  you know  that's funny  because Regis  is in the  middle of the  same kind  of bit  with another  guy  he's got  a guy  going up  we're waiting  for him to  die  the guy  hangs in  there  come on 
[01:32:30]  we got  Larry the  cable guy  coming up  and I hope  our other  guest dies  so he's  angry  Regis is  always angry  perpetually  mad  why don't  you die  hey Tom  what um  you're not  on our  show to  make jokes  Tom  what kind  of gun  do you  own  I have  I own  two weapons  I own  a Walter  PPK  James Bond  Beretta  F92

[01:33:30]  with us  though these  bits are  very real  they're uh  that's the  twisted sense  of humor we  have and we  really did get  frustrated with  the guy we  we brought  him up on  stage during  our comedy  tour we did  everything we  could for  so basically  he's been  going on  10 15  way too  long  yeah too  long  imagine if  he got to  the point  where he  was finally  going to do  it and  and end it  all and  that but  then the  neurological  problem  affected his  trigger fingers  and he  can't do  it  I think  the irony  I think 
[01:34:00]  he's faking  he's doing  it to get  on the air  yeah  it's gotta  be  well then  he's got a  good makeup  bars  because we  met  Tom  yeah  he's a  bit of a  problem  he's not  getting the  proper oxygen  because uh  I guess his  what his lungs  are basically  turning into  cement  yeah yeah  his uh  oh look at uh  Terry O'Quins  on uh  yeah  11 news  we're supposed to  have him on  where you going

[01:40:30]  Bronx tale thing  we did  I do yes  with Chaz  and Richard Voss  did you hear  a Bronxish tale yet  no  oh my god  I guess we got this  in on Friday  I just got to say  that Rich Voss  came in  Jimmy had tricked him  and said that he was  going to read a scene  Rich Voss and Jimmy  were going to read a scene  from a Bronx tale  because Jimmy  Rich thinks he's a good  good actor  right  and we all know he sucks  as being an actor  so he took it very seriously 
[01:41:00]  Jimmy gave him the script  he studied it  and studied it  and then came time  to do the scene  with Jimmy  and he was  and I say  he was nervous  yes he was nervous  like me and him  were going to read it  Rich was running  to the bathroom  rehearsing  because he was  rehearsing his lines  we were going to  see him together  yeah  so he walks up  to the mic  and at the last minute  right before  he's ready to do  the lines  none other  than Chaz Palminteri  himself  who wrote this movie  does the one man show  knows every line 
[01:41:30]  he walks in  and now Rich  has to act  with Chaz Palminteri  a huge actor  and he crapped himself  he got so nervous  and it was bad enough  watching it  but in this piece  you're going to hear  the contrast  between a great actor  like Chaz Palminteri  and a pile of garbage  like Rich Voss  is just startling 
[01:42:00]  look at that last picture  it was hysterical  it's Bobby  are they up on  onaradio.com  put up the other one  Bobby and Rich  sitting on the couch  look at Bobby's face  they're all laughing  they're looking  and Patrice  we can't look  without laughing  you can see  Anthony and myself  the beautiful  sports illustrated model  you got club soda  you got Patrice and Bobby  everyone is looking  in Voss' direction  and laughing  and just laughing  he is horrid  just listen to the  stark contrast  of an actor 
[01:42:30]  that pulls off lines  so naturally  he's just discussing stuff  he's just talking  and another  bumbling boob  who  forget about a paper bag  he couldn't act his way  out of a rolling paper  he is horrid  yeah  and we're going to get  these pictures up  they're not up yet  they were up Friday  oh they were up  let's put them up again  onaradio.com  alright well  they took the audio  from that segment  and they made  a broncish tale  this is Derek and Steve 
[01:43:00]  Robert De Niro  it's not what you say  it's what he sees  in his directorial debut  we can't accept that  starring  Chaz Palminteri  I didn't give it to you  I gave it to your son  and Rich Voss  Louie  Beans  I want my money  a broncish tale  Beans  you can't dodge me forever  come on  what are you doing about  what are you yelling about  huh  John  I got a problem  with this guy over here  Louie Beans  this guy owes me 20  and it's been 2 weeks now  and every time he sees me  he keeps dying to me  John  should I crack him 
[01:43:30]  one or what  the struggle  of an idiotic  Jewish comedian  stammering his way  through a few lines  of film dialogue  with a genuine  Hollywood actor  listen see  sometimes violence  is not the answer  is he a good friend  of yours or no  nah John  I don't even like him  well there's your answer  right there  look at it this way  cost you $20  to get rid of him  he's never going to  ask you for money again  he's never going to  bother you again  he's out of your life  for $20  come on  you got up cheap  you're right John  you're always right  a brush  how do you know 
[01:44:00]  the right ass  all the time Johnny  well I try to keep  my eyes and ears  open all the time  and I read  you read  yeah I read  come on  come on  let's go to  Mario's next door  and get something  oh it's  it's  cringe  inducing  beans  you know  Johnny  beans  you know  the guy  Louis beans  Louis beans  oh and the picture  of him with his hands  out  wow I'm acting  and then you hear 
[01:44:30]  Chaz just do those  lines and it's just  he's talking  it's so natural  you'd never know  he's reading lines  even though he's got to  memorize you know  the way it comes out  and then  beans  he's charging me  like my daughter  for me it's hard to say  somebody's name in a scene  like we're doing a scene  together  I always have trouble  like uh  like you know  hey man I heard you were  gambling Anthony  and you know  it obviously was good  yeah yeah  I'm saying that to you  for real  but if I was reading  that in a scene  it would be like  I'm hard 
[01:45:00]  I heard you were good  Anthony  it's so awkward  to say a name  yeah  so you could see  that's  it's a little weird thing  that always trips me up  you can see how awful  Voss  Johnny  it's just so unnatural  Johnny  how do you do it  what  oh  act  yeah  oh it's horrible  just amazing  there you have it  bronchish tale  yeah  Voss is a dope  oh  just a horrible  he's not an actor  we gotta get Lenny Bruce 
[01:45:30]  to audio  cause he claims  he was so great  as Lenny Bruce  yeah that I wanna hear  we did that  there's no way  he could have been good  yeah  he insists  he was  he couldn't have been  well he insists  alright we got  a kids book  about gay penguins  being pulled from the shelves  we can do that  after the break  kids caught doing  coke in class  we got  more Michael Madsen stuff  what do you wanna do  how old are the kids  doing coke  5 and 7  see that's a good story 
[01:46:00]  right  I don't know  but if they're older  not such a good story  actually 25 and 27  oh  third grade  I shouldn't be doing that  well we could do the  you wanna do the Madsen  it is Michael Madsen  Tuesday  throw a little more  Madsen on  he did a great job  before we go to break  and regroup here  alright  well Michael Madsen  at this point we don't  really feel like explaining  but he came in Friday  he gave us a great interview  and someone bitched 
[01:46:30]  because we were kinda  kissing his butt  a little too much  oh  the guy did a great job  for us  why wouldn't we  so we decided to make  the whole day  Michael Madsen day  this is Michael Madsen  reviewing his own movies  he does this on his website  and we discover that fact  in this clip here  wait a minute  is this you  suggesting what to see  and what not to see  of your own movies  um  yeah  wait go up  he's gotta  you gotta go to  michaelmadsen.com  this is amazing  it was only a while ago  he recommends movies  recommend if you can find it movies 
[01:47:00]  watchable  watchable movies  are these all movies you're in  or just movies in general  no they're the ones I'm in  yeah  and then uh  watchable  and then it gets down to  skip it  his own movies  he's telling you to skip it  and then he goes down to  unwatchable  holy  and he lists the ones  that are just completely  unwatchable  and then  can't rate  never seen it  so there's something  you've never even seen  the movie  you've never seen it  you've never seen it  you've got a category  can't rate  never seen it 
[01:47:30]  have you ever seen  a more honest  actor  no wonder you're not  getting work in the  United States  exactly  you see  you see how that  works  how about you  don't burn a bridge  I'm gonna hire him  no  he's an indie guy  here's an example  you gotta  you gotta go to his website  it's better than this interview  Flat Out  which is one of the movies  was it a movie  I don't even know  it's in the section  can't rate  never seen it  and this is a one line  he gives for Flat Out  interesting film about 
[01:48:00]  a paralyzed motorcycle race  shot in two days  as a favor to the producer  it's like  helping someone move  either move a couch  or make a movie  for today  if I hadn't have done it  I would have had to move  it was time to pay the rent  man  you know  that is  what are you gonna do  wow  that's fantastic  alright here's another one  you know I gotta do this  Ghost  I know you gotta go  but this is too good 
[01:48:30]  Ghost  he explains it this way  low budget movie  made during a time  I was trying to pay my mortgage  also released as  Code of the Dragon  trying to pay the mortgage  holy  I could have said  a few more things  about that piece of  and there you have it  Michael Madsen  an open honest guy  that's great man  yeah I can't wait  he's what he is  he hasn't  that was the first time  he was in New York  in five years  so hopefully

[01:53:30]  down  I just want  to acknowledge  that that is  just some dumb  thing that I  decided to start  doing  how about this  here's how you  do it  like the next  time you say  I'm gonna do  that just go  you know what  I won't  yeah say it  out loud  I won't  you'll feel it  in your hand  you'll feel the  energy in your  hand  oh boy  telling you  it's weird  it's like  it's hard  to not do  something when you  want to do  like for me  it was tapping  my right fingernail  yeah yeah  it feels right  there's something  wrong  ah no there's  not  there's no  rationale for that  no there isn't  I don't know why  but I have to  just  ah god 
[01:54:00]  things are much  better now  it's on the  brink of disaster  but now  it's fine  ah god  100% better  how distracted  would that be  on radio  I love the  will you stop  doing that  well if I could  I would  well for some  reason I need  to pick my  hand for a  year straight  I don't know  oh my god  what are you  picking  it's between  his thumb  and pointer  finger  kind of where  the thumb  muscle is  it started out  as a little  scab  yeah I cut  myself in  probably the  same spot  but I'll 
[01:54:30]  leave it alone  god bless you  man my family  we're all about  picking  we all are  pickers  oh god  yeah  you see this  thing right here  a dumb little  scrape that will  go away in  three days  will go away  in about  18 months  because then  we pick it  to the point  now like I  got scar tissue  there and that  I'm now like  messing with  why are you  picking it  I don't know  it's just a  nerve  I don't know  why  Kenny slaps  Kenny slaps  my hand  don't do that  no he doesn't  even say that  he just slaps  my hand really  hard to make  me stop  and then he  gets band-aids  I have a scar  here because I  had that mole  removed 
[01:55:00]  oh boy  oh boy  what happened  nothing it's fine  it might have been  a ward or something  but it's not  cancerous  he doesn't think so  so I had the  little mole removed  and the scar  it'll be healed  up soon  I wouldn't  even occur  to me to  pick it  no no  picking  I never  pick scars  hey  blue healer  sorry Jimmy  because that's  no that's  important but  blue healer  just got my  attention  they selected  the bits  for you  for the  contest  yuck  wait what  what do you  mean  why would  they select  the bits  for the  contest  what 
[01:55:30]  you rock  Mike  they could  select  act it out  too  they could  select bits  that  that people  could  you know  obviously  use  but let  them  pick  whatever  they  want  what's  up  Steve  oh  to  anime  preselected  bits  because they  had to be  CBS safe  because they  want to post  them online  so they  couldn't be  whatever bits  they wanted  why don't they  just let  them animate  them and send  them in  and if we  can't put  it online  then how  about  then they  don't  get online  so they'll  have to  use their  better  judgment  we could  perhaps  beep  something  beep  something  how about  CBS  wakes 
[01:56:00]  let the  fans do  it  it's not  bad  we won't  put it  up  what selected  bits  do they  choose  by the  way  probably  like really  bad  like a bad  interview  with somebody  we don't  care about  like real  safe  can we  let people  pick their  own bits  please  we could  always beep  something out  this is why  we say no  to everything  because when  they get a  hold of it 
[01:56:30]  they just  it might  still be  good  who's the  actual person  that chose  the bits  who's the  actual person  not CBS  who did it  the janitor  because that's  the only person  that's left  around here  they fired  everybody  who did it  I think  driven down  the hall  so the  dump guy  is choosing  the bits  wow  how's that  happened  I'll just  tell you this  much  I'm just  gonna laugh 
[01:57:00]  all the way  to the end  I decided  I'm just  gonna openly  laugh  all the way  to the end  until the day  they just  changed the  locks  on the door  I'm just  going to  laugh  all the way  to the end  it's not  even a knock  on Jim  but how  that happens  we have to  pick safe  bits  so rather  than give  it to  why do we  have to  pick safe  bits  because they  want to be  able to post  them online  I'm assuming  so they  don't want  they can post  whatever they want  no they don't  they don't get  posted wherever  they want  if it's CBS's  contest  but if it's  stuff that has  been done  on the show 
[01:57:30]  already  that's pretty much  safe radio  how about it's  not stuff  from XM  it's only CBS  stuff so then  it's guaranteed  to be safe  because it aired  on their airway  that's why I'm  laughing all the way  to the end  because it's not  good enough that  you're doing a  safe radio show  for them  now they're going  to look at the  content of some  of these bits  we have done  and they don't  want them part  of this contest  even though when  we did it on  the radio  it was safe  and that's why  I laugh right  to the end  now  I can't be  bothered arguing  with this crap  anymore 
[01:58:00]  how about  they just  pick what  they want  can we  see there's  the laugh  can we  have enough  faith  let's just  let them  do it  can we  fix that  that stinks  yeah  do we have  any examples  of bits  that they've  picked already  can we hear  one  wait a doctor  touches Opie  inappropriately  is one of  the bits  they could  animate  alright  then I have  no problem  with it  because that  was pretty  edgy  no not  just because  it's an  OP bit  but that's  edgy  maybe we're  carrying on  too much  I'm trying  to have more  of an open  mind  too  Anthony  describes  the future  from a  1950s  viewpoint  that was  pretty 
[01:58:30]  edgy  as well  Jim Norton  dreams about  sex with his  girlfriend  and his  ex-boss  alright  we're fine  that was  good  we're fine  OP Anthony  and Jimmy  get new  names  did we go  off half  cocked  is that  what we  did  we got  all crazy  and said  hey  no why  are you  picking it  and then we  looked and went  hey that's  not bad  that's fine  I mean  fair is fair  it's fine  I would love  to trash  these guys  oh trust  me I  would love  to  but they  get a  pass  today  pass 
[01:59:00]  here's a  story that  we couldn't  do last  week because  we ran  out of  time  and now  I just  got to  find the  story and  then it'll  make sense  I was  going to  replay the  Hillary song  for everybody  because it  just makes  I love  that song  it is  so bad  so bad  yeah  but instead  we got  this  we got  this  this is  just a  horrific  9-1-1  story  listen to  this  imagine calling  9-1-1 
[01:59:30]  as a fire  in your home  begins to  spread and  the dispatcher  puts you on  hold  oh boy  that's what  happened to  a woman in  Pennsylvania  by the time  someone took  her call  it was too  late  listen to  what happened  it took  six rings  before an  operator  answered  her call  one ring  it  9-1-1  can you  hold  one second  please  I can't  it's an  emergency  it's on fire  Brenda  or bedridden  with multiple  sclerosis  was placed  on hold  it took  25 long 
[02:00:00]  well there's  the first  problem  right there  I mean  when someone  goes  when they  ask you  the question  can  can you  hold  and someone  goes  I can't  no  I'm on  fire  then that  that's  that's  that's  not good  some people  go yeah  I can  because the  emergency  isn't a  a actual  holy  s emergency  she was in  a holy  s emergency  situation  and they even  asked her  can you  hold  and she  yells  no  I can't  Brenda 
[02:00:30]  or bedridden  with multiple  sclerosis  was placed  on hold  it took  25 long  seconds  before a  second operator  finally picked  up the call  thanks for  holding  9-1-1  where's your  emergency  hello  9-1-1  the bed  is on fire  are you still  in the house  yes  all right  well you  want to get  out of the  house  no  I'm disabled  the bed  is pulling  and sling  ma'am  you still  there  by the time  the emergency  response team  arrived at the  scene it was 
[02:01:00]  too late  she had died  in the fire  disciplinary action  has been taken  against 15  members of the  Bucks County  emergency  communications  staff  they weren't  paying attention  to their job  they were  they were  just not  doing their  job properly  how did her  bed catch on  fire  was she  smoking in bed  midnight oil  fan  how couldn't  she move  the covers  yeah I guess 
[02:01:30]  she was  she's disabled  so she probably  couldn't move  that is  that is horrible  how the hell  did the bed  catch on fire  you know  something  probably was  smoking  I would bet  smoking  yeah  which in that  case  I'm going all  in with  smoking  in that case  who cares  if something  happened  like a plug  shorted out  behind the  wall  and lit  the bed  on fire  then there's  a  that's pretty  horrible  even smoking  though  you don't plan  on burning  to death  in your own  house  the bed's  on fire  all right  get out of  the bed  oh 
[02:02:00]  here it is  how do we  sleep while  our beds  are burning  how do we  sleep while  our beds  are burning  no  she's dead  that is just 
[02:02:30]  horrible  yep  oh well  she probably  she didn't die  of smoke inhalation  man she burned  burned  you could hear it  in the background  yeah  you could hear it  kind of like this  during the phone call  I don't know  I'd drag myself  with my teeth  on the floor  or something  stop being lazy  get the hell  out of bed  roll  do something  I think the worst  part is that she  had multiple  sclerosis  sclerosis  the guy said  yeah  he couldn't say  sclerosis 
[02:03:00]  one two three  four five six  two thousand  beat wisconsin  ohio texas  and on to penn state  she's gonna do it  give her just a chance  she'll make it  she should be saying  this as she's on  something  that is sinking  underwater  he can't help  what do you got 
[02:03:30]  this is just  fantastic stuff  I swear to god  the second you were  like a 9-1-1  operator  I swear I was like  please don't let her  be black  please don't let her  be black  you know  I'm gonna have to  put you on hold  a minute  9-1-1  may I help you  oh no  cause one time  I called  like my roommate  at NYU  was like  he had like a seizure  or whatever  and I called him  like 9-1-1  and I was like  I could barely hear  I'm like  listen  can you speak up  I am speaking up  oh god  I'm beginning to  understand racism 
[02:04:00]  why are you being  so angry  later Nick  the car is on  after us here  in New York City  let's say hi  to John  in North Carolina  John what's up  hey  that's what that  old lady gets  for beating up  poor old Farrah  Fawcett  ooh look at that  little callback  from The Burning  Bed  Farrah's real  first dramatic  role  it kind of  started all  those lifetime  guys suck  movies  she went from 
[02:04:30]  Charlie's Angels  to the dramatic  role of The Burning  Bed where her  husband abused her  and she poured  gasoline on him  in bed  lit it on fire  he died  and that was  whole courtroom  drama  after that  and I think  she now has  the poopy  cancer  yes she does  she's got  the cancer  of the  brown spot  she has  what's that  a colon  I think  you know  something  it was  I read it  as anal  cancer 
[02:05:00]  oh  so  can you look  that up  real quick  she's been  fighting it  in Germany  or something  she decided  she needs to  do one  coffee enemas  and things  like that  I don't know  but supposedly  she's doing  okay  the old Paul Ingalls  tried that one too  she might end up  alright after all  they thought she was  on her last leg  cough and smell like  a percolator  and that's about  all it did for him  instead of diapers  he's got to wear  like little filters  coffee filters  filter underpants  do you have the number  the brown number  fours  yeah it's the big 
[02:05:30]  A cancer  as far as the  yeah  yes let's say  hi to Ted  in South Dakota  Ted  hello Ted  happy birthday  oh thank you  very much  it's not his  birthday  it's not  they said  this woman  was on hold  for 25 seconds  yeah  what the hell  are the emergency  responders supposed  to do in 25 seconds  that's not going  to happen immediately  that's a good point  I mean she would  have been dead  anyway  it's like they  put her on hold  for an hour  yeah that's true  you don't smoke  in bed  you old  twisted tree root  you take those

[02:07:30]  material here  material that  isn't suitable  for young children  put a little warning  on and let the  parents decide  how can you tell  what a penguin  anyway  I know  little fat things  that smell  and they both  they all dress like  guys to begin with  exactly  yeah they all  look alike  are you a waiter  or a lesbian  I can't tell  what you are  I agree with  Blue Healer  by the way  we haven't talked  about it yet  but Lindsay Lohan  is nude  and she looks 
[02:08:00]  like hell  and I am so  with you  Blue Healer  big story  Lindsay Lohan  decided she was  going to do  recreations of  Marilyn Monroe's  last photo shoot  so  some of these  are  her nude  through some  very thin  silk material  you can see  everything  the black and  white shots  are really  disturbing  because  she is  covered  in freckles  in freckles 
[02:08:30]  and things  her entire body  that's sexy  actually  a couple of  pictures are good  she's got very  nice natural  boobs  but she's not  that  she's no  Marilyn Monroe  go to the  black and white  ones  no the other  ones where  she's kind of  yeah look at  that  she looks good  man  nice little  freckled body  a freckle  here and there  I get it  yeah that's fine  but that's  kind of  like look at  her belly  it's just  it's all over  like she got  like you took

[02:09:30]  last photo shoot  just dead with  a bunch of pills  yeah  being wheeled out  on that gurney  Bobby Kennedy's  DNA hair  I just saw  a shot of her  like pretty much  the whole front  of her nude  that covered up  the part  but if you were  going to have  sex with her  you would  have to say  is that an STD  or do you have  just a lot of  freckles  really  did you see that  shot  there's a lot  going on down  there  what the front  one  let me see  look  well no  the other one  E  E to the R 
[02:10:00]  look at all  that  I know  there's just  a lot  wow  yeah look at  all that  you would  have to ask  what is that  can I catch  that  what  especially  he's an  Appaloosa  I don't  it's a horse  yeah  alright  here's the second  they're spotted  here's the second  part of the  penguin story  Dalmatian  should go with that  damn it  it's alright  the school principal  and a district  review committee  did not find  the book  inappropriate  but the school  superintendent  overruled them  he removed 
[02:10:30]  Antango makes  three  from the shelves  at 16 elementary  schools  and put it  on a restricted  list  Lindy Garnett  executive director  of parents  families  does anyone  know what a  restricted list  is  it's a list  because they can't  officially ban books  I guess  because there would  be a lot of outrage  so what is it  it's kind of like  banning books  yeah it's kind of  only not as  Nazi Germany-ish  you might have to  they did it to  Happy Endings too  in a Mississippi library  I think you have to  request it especially  in order to see it  some garbage that they do  wouldn't those be  the best books to read 
[02:11:00]  now I gotta go to a library  and see what's on  the restricted list  John could I have  what's on the  restricted list  please  is Lolita on that list  yes I want to  read that one  is Lolita  on the restricted list  Lolita  oh my god  the uncensored version  please  you only made a few  copies the French version  what was the dirtiest  book you ever read  dirtiest book I ever read  not counting  you know  all out pornography  like something that is  like a legit book 
[02:11:30]  like Lolita would be  a perfect example  yeah that  a lot of people say  that's legit literature  and really dirty  that's pretty bad  pretty much a major  turn on  if you read that book  that one is pretty bad  that's something we gotta do  does he have sex  with her in the book  oh yeah  oh yeah  have you ever seen Lolita  Lolita  it's the Peter Sellers  isn't it the  Uncle or something  Peter Sellers  I'm sorry Stanley Kubrick  Stanley Kubrick  Peter Sellers  well they've redone  the movie a bunch of times  I am going to have  sex with you  Peter Sellers 
[02:12:00]  he's all wacky  hey tomorrow  on the show  dirtiest book you read  little homework assignment  wake up Cleveland  it's time to participate  you've been  sitting there doing nothing  for this radio show  just listening to repeats  now we're live  now you got a homework assignment  dirtiest book  you ever read  that wasn't pornography  like people would consider it  legit literature  okay  because there is a few out there  there's another one I read  it was just sex stories  it was  I gotta remember this book  it was like 
[02:12:30]  wow  better than like  penthouse form  and all that crap  and it was legitimate literature  but I can't remember  it was a group of stories  and I think it was  a French  a French writer  oh  French  here's the rest  of the penguin story  director of parents  families and friends  of lesbians and gays  says  the book is not about  same sex couples  it doesn't talk about sex  it talks about  a relationship  and a family  and it talks about penguins  the award winning book  is a true story  it describes how Roy and Silo  sleep together  and make a nest 
[02:13:00]  just like boy and girl  penguin couples  Garnett understands  it may be uncomfortable  for some parents  but says removing the book  from general circulation  is de facto censorship  if we start saying  we're going to censor  what our children see  in the library  it's a slippery slippery slope  and whose values  and whose ideals  are we going to use  to make those determinations  it is still available  people can still check  it out  it has not been banned  it's available  only to parents 
[02:13:30]  and teachers  by request  the school district  says it's trying  to be sensitive  but matters like this  are always likely  to cause a firestorm  I don't have a big  problem with this  no  I really don't  because you can still  get the book  yeah as long as  you can still get it  it's still idiotic  and I agree with  the lesbian spokesperson  who was speaking  I agree with her  but it was odd  the language she used  about you know  complaining about  how somebody else's  ideology is going to be  determining  determining thing  it's so funny  how that's the same  argument she would use 
[02:14:00]  to protest a guy  like Mike Savage  who says a lot of things  that gay people don't like  it's amazing  how she's using  the same rhetoric  to defend that book  that somebody else  would  you understand what I mean  that her group  would use to condemn  somebody else  yeah  they're all phonies  yeah  all phonies  phonies  frauds  frauds  fa-chins  ca-von  get off my phone  you savage  alright guys 
[02:14:30]  we're off to XM  yeah  very excited to be  live in Cleveland  so  yes  awesome  it's been a long time  real long time  so  we'll take more of those  calls tomorrow  absolutely  alright man  have a great day  this is the  Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony 
[02:15:00]  it's the Opie and Anthony show  you 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  And then I got to get to my lawyer by three o'clock.  It's just annoying.  Leave me alone.  I've done enough.  Didn't you get divorced like when the first Bush was in presence?  Dude.  In the White House, I mean?  Yeah, it's been long enough.  It's been long enough, okay?  Holy motherfucker.  It's been what?  I mean, I mean, I mean, I'm right already. 
[02:19:30]  Enough.  We get it.  I shouldn't have to deal with this shit.  I got to go through papers from fucking years ago.  I got to go through papers from fucking years ago and try to find one out of files and files  and shit.  Bring it to a lawyer.  Oh, you got lawyers.  Enough with the lawyers.  I've had it with lawyers.  How much do you hate her?  Let's just say her.  How much do you hate her?  I get angry listening to you.  There aren't words to describe it. 
[02:20:00]  And I might have heard.  Well, I'll just.  You probably shouldn't.  Pending litigation.  Pause.  Never could.  I'm just saying in some of these cases, like the woman is being taken care of for over  a decade after the fact that you decided that the relationship is over.  Yeah.  And I've heard that in some cases, the woman is still very bitter as they sit in court and  stuff.  Oh, yeah.  That'll happen.  Yeah. 
[02:20:30]  That'll happen.  Like once you just shut your mouth and realize you won the lottery.  Jesus Christ.  I just want it done with.  That's all.  My lawyer talks to some other lawyer and goes, all right, that's done.  Here's everything everyone needs.  End of story.  But no, it's got to drag on and on and on just so there's some kind of fucking interaction  between the two people involved, the principals. 
[02:21:00]  I don't want interaction.  Maybe I just want to fucking not have to worry about lawyers anymore.  Maybe she's hoping you're going to change your mind.  Holy motherfucker.  I'd sooner.  I'd sooner shoot myself in the head.  I decided to go on a 10 year long weekend thing.  Yeah, that's all.  Then we'll get together.  Everything will be happily ever after.  Yuck.  Not a million. 
[02:21:30]  If I was fucking.  I am a legend.  It wouldn't happen.  I'd say, ah, you know something.  Nice to stop by, but I'll wait for someone else to come.  By the way, when we walked in today.  Yeah.  What happened, Jimmy?  I watched that Gone Baby Gone.  Yeah.  I liked the movie.  I liked Amy Ryan.  That movie, I want my 90 minutes of life back.  It was, I felt more satisfied after standing on the side of the road with a flat tire. 
[02:22:00]  I felt like my time was better spent.  That fucking fifth grade boy sentiment type writing.  I wanted to just, I wanted to light myself on fire like an MS lady in a bed and watch that hunk of shit.  Morgan Freeman is the most overrated fucking actor in Hollywood.  He plays the same part.  Did he play that guy again?  He plays the same part.  The soft spoken, very wise.  I had a daughter.  Yeah, we know.  Same inflection in every movie.  Yeah.  They'll just move your fucking mouth like the talking dog ads. 
[02:22:30]  Fucking superimposed dialogue.  Were you?  Stinks.  Were you surprised to find out that the kid was alive during the whole movie?  No, I wasn't.  I don't care who you blow it for.  As an adult, I would.  If an adult had written it, I might have been surprised.  But like, this is the worst part.  The writer was so awful at idea conveying, he had to spell it out for the audience through bad character dialogue.  Like, one of the lines is like stuff like, it's wrong to hurt a child.  That was Ed Harris.  Of course it was.  Is it?  I like your Ed Harris impression. 
[02:23:00]  That is a good one.  That's a pretty good Ed Harris.  That was very nice.  And then there's one where someone shoots a pedophile and the girl goes, he had to die.  He hurt a child.  Wow.  Really good writing.  Fucking assholes.  And Morgan took the kid from the mom to try to give it a better life.  That's all.  He was terrific.  He was just terrific.  Okay.  Same guy.  You missed him nothing.  I don't want to see it.  He was great in glory.  He's been irritating since then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Same fucking guy in every movie. 
[02:23:30]  Even though he was the same character, I didn't mind him in Shawshank because that  was a little earlier.  He was good in that.  And he hadn't shown that that was all he does.  Yeah.  Soft spoken, wise guy.  And occasionally his voice goes up like that.  That's his idea of inflection.  Well.  I have Sam pulling some Morgan Freeman clips.  From Gone Baby Gone?  No.  No, no, no.  I'll bring them in tomorrow.  We should play Morgan Freeman clips and try to figure out what movie it's from.  What movie it's from. 
[02:24:00]  You'll have a tough time doing it because it's the same part.  Hey, we got the bleachers here.  They're filled with, what, about 10 people?  Yeah.  And we never do this because I hate when comedians do this when you're sitting in the front row  and stuff and putting someone on the spot.  But I got to put you on the spot because this chick is so nervous.  I met her at FH Riley's on, what, Saturday?  Saturday.  Now, you guys might not recognize her, but she's a big star.  And as soon as I saw it at FH Riley's, I'm like, holy shit. 
[02:24:30]  She writes a column for Newsday.  Like, she was the one that wrote the review on FH Riley's and gave it a great review.  Oh, yeah.  But she's reviewed other things, right, in Newsday?  Oh, yeah.  And they put her picture in there and stuff, and I recognized her right away.  Well, she's a huge fan of the show.  Came by FH Riley's, and she almost shit herself.  She came over to our table just to say hi.  I know.  I'm in the presence of greatness, so I'm very nervous.  Wow.  Yeah, she's a very nervous woman.  She writes, and there's a picture in the paper, though?  Because that's like a big deal than just someone that just writes.  What's the name of the column?  I always forget it. 
[02:25:00]  It's the Impulse review crew.  Impulse, right.  So they go out, and they go to a movie, or they go to a restaurant or a club, everything.  And then they write about it.  Haven't we fucked around with the review crew?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course we have.  Yeah.  Yeah, you have.  Did we say bad things about you?  No.  I didn't ask that over the weekend.  No?  Okay.  No.  But she's just very nervous, and she's checking out the show today, so I just want to put her  on the spot.  Thank you.  I forgot your name already.  Laura.  I should remember Laura.  Just look at Sam's hair. 
[02:25:30]  You'll feel better.  Someone's got to tell Sam that Afro Wars ended a month ago.  Why didn't you tell me?  I forgot what he looks like with short hair.  Much more handsome.  It'll be weird.  Is it much more handsome than modest?  Yeah.  It's great.  All right.  And thank you very much, but don't put the straw on top of the autographed Michael Madsen  DVD.  That's right, sweetie.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's good.  He hands me a fucking wet cup, and he puts it on the autographed DVD.  That's good.  That's good.  Why don't you just throw it in the tub?  I'll get it later. 
[02:26:00]  Morgan Freeman irritates me.  I had a 12-year-old daughter.  Or did you?  Yeah.  What happened?  I imagine it was tragic, and you're handling it.  Is that what it is?  She died.  That's good.  That's excellent.  So I made it my life to save other kids.  We want to give this little girl a new life.  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah.  She's not going to hate you when she grows up and figures it all out.  Exactly.  You monotone zilch.  Right.  I suppose Andy was just sitting there trying to be like it was before. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was he?  Let me get this straight.  You want me to understand that you took me from my mommy when I was seven years old.  It was just a fucking childlike idea conveying in the writing.  And there's nothing worse than when some dumb bell tries to over-explain something to me  as a fucking audience.  Like, I know, oh, wow, look who else is out.  Why don't we fucking get him in?  That cocksucker from Lost.  The doctor.  The handsome doctor.  Matthew Fox. 
[02:27:00]  Get him on.  Sounds like we're going to get them all now.  We're going to get all the Lost guys after Fanboy here did a great job with that interview.  Get him on.  Bring him on.  Did what he said he was going to do.  What did he do?  He's the guy who said he would get us lost.  I asked him to get lost, guys.  You're welcome, audience.  Oh, that, uh, Behind the Closed Doors meeting we had.  Oh, of course.  We'll promote your shitty movie, but get us the Lost Guys.  What?  No, that never happened.  Don't fuck up the Lost Guys thing. 
[02:27:30]  Don't panic.  We'll still get the Lost Guys.  I want to get Kate.  You know we're joking.  We might be able to get her, actually.  We'll get Kate on.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She's cute.  She's got big buck teeth.  Yeah.  Oh, the Australian or whatever?  She killed someone in the...  She's adorable.  No, not the Australian one.  I want to get...  No, I know who you mean.  Yeah.  I want to kiss her on the cheek.  Dark-haired one.  Do you?  Yeah.  She's very sweet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I look at her muscular arms.  I'm like, how would she feel if I walked in shirtless?  She's hanging out with all these fucking model, good-looking guys in Hawaii.  And then if I walked in with my pale pink nipples and my fucking, my flabby teats. 
[02:28:00]  I have teats.  I don't even have tits.  I have teats.  Teats?  Yeah.  Like, a small dog should be nursing off my fucking, my fucking mushy udders.  Do we have the audio of Jimmy puking over the weekend?  Jimmy shows us this video of him puking on his...  Did you see the video?  On your blood group.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's so funny.  And, uh...  I feel so bad for him, but it's just a laugh riot.  I was more disturbed about him being, like, shirtless than the puke coming out of his mouth. 
[02:28:30]  And I stand up when I puke, too.  And he goes, I know, I know, I know.  No knees?  No.  Why is that?  Because I'm a fucking man.  You're like a Chinese guy bowing honorably to the toilet bowl or something.  Saying goodbye to puke.  I know.  No, I gotta be on my knees.  I gotta have, like, my hand on the toilet rim.  Yeah.  Well, for what?  I gotta grab the toilet bowl rim and then just kinda...  I don't like it falling from great altitudes. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, I fucking...  I stand up.  You ever puke so hard, you're holding the bowl and you're on your knees, but, like, your  legs jump up in the air, but you're still...  Oh, yeah.  You're just...  It's like...  Every muscle tightens up.  Yeah.  Even your, like, your fucking taint muscle tightens up between your asshole and ball bag.  That whole segment just tightens up.  It's trying to push everything out.  Actually, pukey is not bad.  It's horrid.  It's the fucking...  It's the fucking...  It's the dry...  It's the lead up to it where you're really, really nauseous and you're like, oh, my God, 
[02:29:30]  my mouth is filling with water.  Oh, my God.  Here it comes.  Just fucking jam your fingers down your throat and get it over with.  I don't like the...  Get her done.  Get her done.  I don't like the not really being able to breathe very well as it's happening, because  when you'd stiffen up and go, and then you're just like, oh, my God, this better stop or  I'm just going to suffocate.  I could feel...  I had just meaty hunks of food coming up.  That's bad, too.  You need some kind of a...  It was like a solid... 
[02:30:00]  Oh, it's great.  Because I've never gotten sick from just eating until very recently.  It's always been from drinking.  So the first time I got sick from eating, I was puking and going, oh, this hurts.  And there's like big shit coming up.  Usually it's just, okay, there's the fucking wine.  It looks like I'm puking up blood.  That's nice.  Oh, there's foamy beer.  I imagine it's very similar to giving birth.  Yeah, to fucking chicken and rice.  You got big shit coming out. 
[02:30:30]  That's nice.  You're foaming and other juices.  Giving birth fucking, I don't know, maybe seven months too early.  Right.  Here's Jimmy Puking.  By the way, I need to interrupt real quick since it'll be over.  The way Kelly Ripa is looking at this Matthew Fox on Regis, if he took his dick out, she  would give up her career to nuzzle his ball bag.  You've never seen an I-want-to-fuck-you look.  You're nuzzling a ball bag.  Enough!  Okay.  All right, here we go.  Jimmy Puking. 
[02:31:00]  For the people that haven't heard yet.  Okay, here's Jimmy Puking.  Oh.  No, no, no, no.  That's my favorite part, like the lamb was officially born. 
[02:31:30]  That's my favorite part. 
[02:32:00]  I like that 
[02:32:30]  You can't get that shit out of your mouth fast enough  You're like  It was full hunks of food in my mouth  It was a piece of food  You can hear how that sound like stew was being dumped in the toilet  By the way, none of that's repeated audio  That's like all different vomit audio  Did it make you feel better?  When I was done, I woke up a couple hours later  And did fucking two and a half hours of radio 
[02:33:00]  And felt like a million bucks  Or four hundred thousand bucks, not quite a million  Food, alright  Apparently not  Yeah, but you had the fish as you were flying  But no, I felt fine the next day  No, well, yeah, because you got it out of your system  You puked it out  A couple hours later, I was fucking up  You did good  You did good  I got a ride in today  In a clown car  Poor Kenny  That non-working truck of yours bugs me 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, what happened, Kenny?  Your mic's on over there, I think  We got you a mic and everything  No, it's either the battery or the alternator  When will you know?  You know when you buy the alternator  That it's the battery  And vice-y-versa  And then when you replace both  And it still doesn't start  You take it to a mechanic  I'll get a new one  It's always the way it's been with me  Yep  Back in the old days  You alright, Kenny?  No, I'm just waiting for James' food order 
[02:34:00]  Oh, sorry  Oh, I knew you were distracted  Yeah, I know  I'm over there  My mind's occupied  With one whole thing  One entire thing  Kenny is a one task at a time  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  We're trying to talk about your car  But you're distracted right now  We thought we'd get a minute or two  On your car  Breaking down  But I guess not  No, there's nothing to talk about  It was lucky that it started yesterday  So we could get home from the airport  And it was unlucky that it didn't start this morning 
[02:34:30]  Did it start like  No, no  It's just you turn the key, nothing  No, no  When it started  Yesterday  No, no  Yesterday I turned the key, nothing  I thought it was my imagination  So I turned it again  And it started right off  See, that's a problem  That doesn't sound like an alternator or a battery  That sounds like an ignition switch problem  Alright, well, I'll bring it to the guy  Do you get any sound whatsoever?  A click or anything?  No, absolutely not  That doesn't sound like an alternator problem 
[02:35:00]  Or a battery problem  Sounds like you need gas  That's an ignition problem  Maybe the computer  Go take the tires  Alright, Kenny doesn't want to play  He's distracted  I like that  What should I get, Kenny?  We got more audio of Jimmy Pukin here  Oh, really?  Yeah, they brought in some more audio of Jimmy Pukin  Oh, here we go  Equestrian or whatever you call it  Always in the  Oh, wait a minute

She always had to be on top  Like I was some kind of horse or something  You know?  You are the ass end of it  And you got the teeth 
[02:36:00]  So you're halfway there, stupid  I think it's only fair  Because Lenny Bruce has been gone a very long time now  Yeah  That we got to get some actual audio of Lenny Bruce  Yeah, because let me tell you something  That was Rich Voss doing stand-up  It's just fucking Rich  Really?  He didn't try to capture the essence of Lenny Bruce  Really?  I was thinking that I'm lucky enough to hear Lenny Bruce  I've heard Lenny Bruce  Lenny Bruce sounds nothing like that blithering yutz  No 
[02:36:30]  We got some Lenny Bruce?  Alright, Derek found us some Lenny Bruce  So let's start over  Lenny Bruce is kind of jazzy, man  He had kind of a different kind of cadence, man  He was, you know, he's kind of like a  Hey, man, what are you doing?  Like a beatnik kind of a  Kind of a different cadence, you know  Yeah  He called her a cunt, you know  Here's Lenny Bruce  If you've  Never seen this bit before  I want you to tell me  Stop me if you've seen it  I'm going to piss on you 
[02:37:00]  Alright  Wow, way to make Jimmy's point  That's right, by the way  No, I know  Hold on  It was a very slow delivery, yeah  Yeah  Jimmy explained Lenny Bruce  And then we get  Well, tell me if you've heard this one  We get Stephen Wright  Right  But he did talk like, you know  It's just a different 
[02:37:30]  I need a better version  That's a very famous Lenny Bruce bit  But it's not his typical delivery, right?  No  He was more like, he was rocking, man  Yes  You got another clip, hopefully?  The bust  What I got arrested for  In San Francisco  San Francisco  I got arrested for  What do you think?  We can hear that, Daddy  I'm not going to repeat the word  Because I want to finish the gig here tonight  It's  They said it was  It's vernacular for a favorite homosexual practice 
[02:38:00]  A ten-letter word  It's really chic  There's two four-letter words and a preposition  I can't  I wish I could tell you the word  It starts in the C  Well, you know what the word is  Now, it's weird how they manifested that word as homosexual  Because I don't  That relates to any contemporary chick I know  Or would know  Or would love  Or would marry  You know  And  Now, when I took the bust  I finished the show  I said that word  You know, the ten-letter word  And he comes over  And he says  Lenny, my name is Sergeant Blum Blum 
[02:38:30]  You know the word you said?  I said a lot of words  Well, that word  Oh, yeah  Well, Lenny, that's against the Lord  I'm going to take you down  Okay  That's cool  Gotcha  That's against the Lord to say it  And to do it  Well, I didn't do it, man  I know, but  I just have to tell you that all the time  Okay  All right  Now  We're getting in the way again  And the one heat is cool  Because he said  You broke the law  And specifically  Now, the other guy  Look, I've got a wife and kid  I don't want to hear that crap at all, man  I don't want to get involved emotionally with this 
[02:39:00]  What do you mean you want to hear that crap?  Would your wife ever do that to you?  Bam  Then it got very sticky  No  You ever say the word?  No  Never said honest to God  Never said the word?  Never  How long you married?  18 years  You ever chip it down your wife?  Never  Never one time in 18 years  You chip it down your old lady?  Never one time  Then I love you  Because you're a spiritual guy  But if you're lying  You'll spend some dead time in purgatory  The bit goes on for a while  Okay  That's really funny though  It is good  Oh, Barry  Yeah  You get sucked in  You want to hear the whole thing  Yeah, that's Lenny  Cocksucker jokes  That's how Lenny performed  And now we've got Rich Voss doing it 
[02:39:30]  Exactly  Same voice  It's unbelievable  Cocksucker  Equestrian or whatever you call it  Always in the saddle  If you know what I mean  This is Voss of Caroline  She always had to be on top  Like I was some kind of horse or something  You know?  That's right  Women like to be on top  That's Lenny Bruce  What about you?  You like the top?  That's a word  They had to  See the actors  They had to say it  That's, by the way  That's Lenny Bruce  No, that was a question  That was by the director  They just left it in 
[02:40:00]  That's Lenny Bruce  That's Lenny Bruce  That's Lenny Bruce  Oh, fuck  That was a  Oh  They added that line  He awful  Yeah  We're going to have to tell the audience  That's Lenny Bruce  Somehow, someway  Yeah, usually  Because no one's going to believe it  Usually the audience figures it out on their own  But in this case  We're going to have to tell them  Awful Rich Voss  That's Lenny Bruce  That's Lenny Bruce  What about you?  You like the top? 
[02:40:30]  Or are you more into that traditional garden variety sex?  Hold on  Are you more into that traditional?  That traditional  I don't think Lenny Bruce was swallowing words like that  Lenny's word kind of trailed off  He just kind of, you know  He was disinterested  He was just kind of like  Yeah, yeah  Like you on top  And just kind of moved to the next one  Right  Traditional  This character speaking idiot  They could have picked the worst person to play Lenny Bruce  On top?  Was this a student film or  I don't know  No, it was a show  Oh no, it was on ABC 
[02:41:00]  It was a TV  It was a TV show  American Dream  Call it  Yeah  Dreams or something  What about you?  You like the top?  Or are you more into that traditional garden variety sex?

[02:42:30]  Fucking awful  I want to bite Voss' fingers  No, but that's so tiny  Like when you feed a fucking horse oats  Yeah  Your hands are all gnarled up  My grandmother told me a story about that  My whole life  If you're gonna feed a horse oats  Keep your hand flat out  Flat  Flat, yes  But it's like  And she's like  I saw a little girl's hand get mauled  When I was young  Nice  How dumb was this cunt  Why did she fucking put her fingers like all together  And then tape the oats to them  How long did she leave me in the horse mouth  It's only gonna nibble a little bit

Someone's making coffee  Oh, that's just a coffee machine  There you go  Okay  Oscar moments  We got Voss and Bob Kelly doing 
[02:43:30]  There Will Be Blood  Let's take a listen to this  The Opie and Anthony Show presents  Oscar moments  Memorable scenes from Academy Award nominated films  Today's Oscar moment comes from the film  There Will Be Blood  Presented by Rich Voss and Bob Kelly  Say it, say it  I have abandoned my child  Say it louder  Say it louder  I have abandoned my child  I have abandoned my child  I have abandoned my boy  Help pay for the blood 
[02:44:00]  Just give me the blood, Eli  Let me get out of here  Give me the blood, Lord  And let me get away  Stay tuned for more Oscar moments  Presented by The Opie and Anthony Show  Ladies and gentlemen  Rich Voss  Rich  Oh  I've got to say  Bobby was pretty good at that  No, he wasn't  He wasn't?  No, he wasn't  He was just less atrocious than you  You know what?  I guess you couldn't see that 
[02:44:30]  He didn't open his eyes as wide as you do  When you act  I'm not saying I'm great  I don't claim  You act like you're Lenny Bruce incarnate  I was expecting to hear Lenny  And all I heard was you  Okay, you know what?  You should be the last critic of anybody  Bobby  After Bobby  I did that scene with Bobby  I was so impressed  It was just  It was great  I'm a good actor, Rich  Hey, Rich  What can you tell us about your Lenny Bruce role?  Well  Here's what happened with Lenny Bruce 
[02:45:00]  This is inside the actor's studio  Yeah  Yes, Rich  Okay  When I got to sides  I didn't have to audition  They gave me the part  Because of who I am  To begin with  Oh my gosh  Exactly  The only comic  Older than Lenny  That's still around  Trying to find a comic  That might have worked  With them back in the day  NBC called and said  Would you like to do Lenny?  And I looked at my schedule  And said, yeah, I'd do it  Yeah  They meant of mice and men, Lenny  What were you too busy doing 
[02:45:30]  Instead of like  I don't know  Walking around Montreal with you  When you were out of work  That's what I was doing around then  Yeah, but you should have maybe  Like researched the role  Yep  Well, hold on  You didn't let me finish  Alright, go ahead  Okay  The production shouldn't have either  Please leave  There's only like five lines  Then I get there 
[02:46:00]  You know, the day before  You know, I go over to the studio  That's what you usually do  And I met with the producer  Director  And they handed me up  Two pages of like  Six paragraphs  Right  So  Where'd you park?  What'd you have for lunch?  Dumbass  Exactly  They gave me  So I went to the  You know, and then I  You know, I went there  And I had my hair one way  But they changed it  My hair looked a little more  Like Lenny's  And 
[02:46:30]  You know  And then I did  But Voss, why wouldn't you  Like, I don't know  Watch some Lenny Bruce  To prepare for the role  Exactly  How do you know I didn't?  I didn't  Because  Listening to that  There's no difference  Than listening to  Any tape of you  At any comedy club  It's you  It's not  It's not Lenny Bruce  You're not  Playing Lenny Bruce  You're doing  Rich Voss  Doing crowd work  Yeah, you were getting  Legitimate laughs  But I'm sure they were  Told to laugh 
[02:47:00]  For the production  Yeah, of course  Here's what happened  I started doing my material  And they were  Cutting the laughs in  You know, I started  Working the crowd  But  You know what  I was playing  I mean, that's how  I researched the role  I'm not going to  I'm not an impressionist  I'm not going to do  His voice  I played  Curse the thought  Wait, no, no  When you're playing  Lenny Bruce  You should do his voice  Yeah  Because that's  You don't play his spirit  You don't eat the same  Lunch he ate  You have to sound like him  Yeah  Hey, by the way 
[02:47:30]  Did I tell you  I'm playing  I'm playing Jim Morrison  Are you?  Right now  Yeah  Because I say I am  You think  Because you say  You're Lenny  You're Lenny  I'm not throwing an impression  You know, I got  I got many great emails  And a lot of people  Hold on, Rich  We know you're good  Hold on, man  Sam Kinison wants to check in  Actually, this is  Sam Kinison  Sam  Oh, oh, oh  Oh, oh  Hey, it's Sam Kinison  Oh, oh, oh 
[02:48:00]  Wow  Wow, just like him  That is a better Kinison  Than Voss was as Lenny Bruce  Yeah  Listen  Listen, slow  Radio Day  No, it's not  You've been talking about  This Lenny Bruce thing  For a while  And I don't know  The show just kind of  Led into us  Playing the audio  That's all  Well, but if you look at  You see what  You're just playing the audio  Of course  Rich, it's obvious  You didn't like  Research the part  That's right  You're wrong 
[02:48:30]  Go and click it  Watch it  And see how I  Stand  And I  And I  Do you put your arms out  Like you did with  Chaz Palminteri  Beans  You know what  A couple people  Came up to me  This weekend  And said  You know  It didn't sound that bad  Yes  Daughter one  And daughter two  You are delusional  When were you  At the school  For the deaf  And blind  This is like  Rapid fire  Listen 
[02:49:00]  Sorry  Do we have more  Lenny Bruce  See  Yeah, right  I'd rather listen  To Lenny now  Than Voss  Voss  This is  Actual Lenny Bruce  Listen  Do that to you  Bam  Then it got very sticky  No  You ever say the word  No  Never said it  Honest to God  Never said the word  Never  How long you married  18 years  You ever chip you on your wife  Never  Never  Never one time  In 18 years  You chip it down  To your old lady  Never one time  Then I love you  Because you're a spiritual guy  But if you're lying  You'll spend some dead time  In purgatory  Now we really got 
[02:49:30]  Really into it  Into it  Now  Get in the court  The judge  Aaron Alvormitz  A redheaded junkyard  Jew  A real forbissner  With thick fingers  And a homemade glass eye  Tough old  Right  He comes in  Blah blah  Swear the heat in  When he say  Your honor  He said  Blah blah blah  The judge  He said  Blah blah blah  Then the guy  Really yented it up  That's right  I didn't believe it  There was a guy up on the stage  In front of women  In a mixed audience  Saying blah blah blah 
[02:50:00]  The judge  This I never heard  Blah blah blah  Said blah blah blah  He said blah blah blah  I'm not going to lie to you  It's just in a minute  I'm not going to lie to you  Right  The DA  The guy said blah blah blah  Look at him  He's smug  He's not very pet  Then I dug something  They sort of like saying  Blah blah blah  Because they said it  A few extra times  Oh look  Do me a favor too  Because this is very  Self indulgent  But never applaud  Because it really  Breaks my pace  And I hate it  Because I don't know  What to do  I can't smile  Unless you do something funny  And that's not  So don't do it anymore 
[02:50:30]  Now  The got so involved  Blah blah blah  The bailiff is yelling  What do you say shut up  Blah blah blah  They're yelling another chord  What do you say  Blah blah blah  God damn it's good  To say blah blah blah  That blah blah blah  That blah blah blah  That blah blah blah  See  I'm not going to lie  He does sound like  Lenny Bruce  Now this is you Rich  It's very similar  I understand  But we're just  We're just getting  A little picky here  I understand it's very close  Yes  Equestrian  Or whatever you call it 
[02:51:00]  Always in the saddle  If you know what I mean  Right  She always had to be on top  Like I was some kind of  Horse or something  You know  That's right  Women like to be on top  That's Lenny Bruce  What about you  You like the top  Or are you more into  That traditional garden  Variety sex  I don't think  You  I don't think  You got an answer for me yet  How many times a day  Three  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven 
[02:51:30]  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Seven  Nine  Seven  Nine  Nine  That's how much I  Oh yeah  Oh my god  That was the director  It was her line  Because they were in a panic  They went  No one's gonna know  Who the fuck  This guy's supposed to be  You say  That's Lenny Bruce  And you don't even  Stand like him  You're just standing  Like you  Okay  Is that it  Shut up  I'm only talking about  Opie and Anthony  From now on  Oh god  There's a clip  You're standing like you  Yeah  You know I was standing  You know they did a bunch  Of different takes  That's what happened  Why didn't you just watch Lenny 
[02:52:00]  And try to stand like him  What's that  Why didn't you try to stand like Lenny  I think they should have got Slayton to do it  He would have sounded a lot better  They should have gotten anyone else  Patrice  They should have got Patrice  To be more fucking realistic  That's the line  I told you the story when I met Dustin Hoffman  Do you want me to tell it real quick  What did you mean Hoffman  Oh you're gonna hang up on me  No I'm not actually  I didn't know that  Yes you did  When I was at the Oscars backstage  When I was standing next to Dustin Hoffman 
[02:52:30]  And Barbra Streisand  Wow  And I turned to him  And I go  I also played Lenny  Right  And I compared that  To his Oscar nominating performance  Of Lenny Bruce  And I said to him  I go  I watched you play Lenny  So I actually played you playing Lenny  Please tell him you threw up on your shoes  God he should have smacked you  I walked away  You know how it is  When a girl says no to you  All of you do 
[02:53:00]  Shut up  It was horrible  What did he say when you said that  He said thank you  That's a compliment  Yeah  Oh really  Why don't you just look at Barbara Streisand  And go  Hey nice nose Joe  That would have been  More comfortable  Than what you just said  You said to Dustin Hoffman  What else am I gonna say  At least I didn't come running up  With a camera  Why not  Well how about  That would have had more dignity in it  How about hey  I loved you  And I thought Midnight Cowboy  Was the best thing you've ever done  It's been all downhill since then

You don't know about the gay banner ads  Yeah there's 24 hours in a day  I can allocate  That's like  So much energy towards  No that's bullshit  No it's not bullshit  We do a radio show every day  And if like all of a sudden  There was like some kind of commercial 
[03:08:30]  For gay singles  Trust me I would know  And you know what  I don't even listen to the commercials  When we go to break  Because we're trying to get  Other things done  But I would certainly know  If they were advertising  Some kind of gay thing  Gay lube  When we were not  Asshole lube or something  Ass to mouth lube  Whatever it would be  Now I'm aware of it  Now it'll be fixed  Alright thank you Steve  Yeah  Jimmy anything?  No  Just enjoying my tuna fish 
[03:09:00]  Why would you eat fish?  Why wouldn't I?  Steve Steve  Nice  I don't know  Because you have  Your problem with fish  Valentine's Day  Steve's angry  Is he?  Yes  Why is he angry?  I don't know actually  Now if we bring him back in  We get the real Steve  I would like to know  Why he's angry  Watch how this works  Steve  That was the  I'm trying to  Get out of the situation  But now we bring him back  I'm going to ask him  Now it gets good  Why are you angry?  Why are you angry?  You look angry 
[03:09:30]  Actually you know what  I told you  This is textbook radio  There he goes  You bring the guy back  And you're guaranteed  To hear a rant  Go ahead Steve  Get it off your chest  I was in the production room  Because apparently  I don't do enough production  I've now been called out  Three fucking times  And completely derailed  My train of thought  So the next time  Somebody bitches  That there's not enough  Steve production on the air  It's because I keep getting  My fucking ass interrupted  To do this bullshit  So  No and it's not legitimate  It's let's 
[03:10:00]  Let's fuck with Steve  Let's bring him in  There's gay banner ads  On the instant feedback  I didn't fucking know about it  Now I know about it  Now it'll get fixed  It's a stupid  But how is that not  Legitimate though  That's a real question  That's certainly a legitimate  Concern  It was brought up  Now it's brought up again  It'll get fixed  But you're saying  It wasn't legitimate  Jimmy just killed you  That is legitimate  But that is legitimate  Alright fine  There's gay banner ads  On the instant feedback  I'll get them off  The instant feedback  We're supposed to be  Like a guy show  Like we're all about  Chicks and their tits 
[03:10:30]  Right  Are any of the rotating ads  Right AJ poopy shit  Nude  Do they show  I certainly hope not  If they are  Big hard cock  No they wouldn't do that  No  And by the way  Someone's calling me out  Fast Freddy  Yeah those Louis C.K. Bobby Kelly ads  Aren't gay at all  We addressed that  Totally  It was funny for a little little thing  But now it's  It's enough  Enough  Just like calling me out of the studio  Enough  I'm actually trying to get something done  So  Well Jimmy 
[03:11:00]  You know  Alright  It's getting fixed  I'm done  You're blaming me for it  I don't give a shit  I'm done  Jesus Christ  Everyone's on edge  I'll always let Steve know  Everyone's on edge today  But that was a legitimate concern  It's getting fixed  It's getting fixed  I could actually make a phone call  And get it fixed  Or if you want to stop me  Thirteen steps into the other room  And call me back in the room  Yeah  Alright  Yeah  You should understand  That dragging you out of the production room  Is actually good for the radio 
[03:11:30]  We just made something out of this horse shit  Well the thing that I was working on  Is now going to take a little bit longer  What is it?  It's a secret  That means nothing  Oh my god  Thanks Earl  The recording of this  This teen chap  No it's actually going to  Flog somebody else  Into homosexuality  But I'm not going to  It's the remake of  Tubular Bells  Nothing  Alright  Whatever  Because that's a very involved  Piece of music  One  Two  Three  Hold on  Four 
[03:12:00]  Five  Six  Seven  Eight  Nine  Ten  Seven  Twelve  Thirteen  Hey Steve  You got  I got 15 steps  And he called me again  He's losing his mind  Yes  He's angry  I don't know why he was angry  I don't think that was crazy to say  No he's angry  That's fine  That's textbook radio though  Invite the person back in  You're guaranteed to get a rant  Five times 
[03:12:30]  Yeah  I'm busy  Alright we got two more things  We gotta get done here  We got a big lottery thing happening right  The Powerball  What is it up to?  Powerball  Did they get a winner?

In confidence  In confidence  Could you tell me too?  Yeah, I'll tell you too  I like hearing this  When my cock's being sucked  If we turn off the mice  Can you tell us now?  No, no  It's gotta be post-show  Today?  Yeah  That's why I was up so late 
[03:14:00]  Why are you up so late?  Wait  I got home  From Atlantic City  But I couldn't go right to sleep  Because, you know  I was kind of  Preoccupied  You need help  Burying a body?  Um  No  I've never needed help  In that  Um  Yeah, I'll just  I'll tell you  You know, after the show  It's probably best that way  Oh no  Yeah  Yeah 
[03:14:30]  Oh no  Yeah  What?  Oh, I'm not going anywhere  Oh  Oh, are you kidding?  This is me bread and butter  What happened?  Am I going anywhere?  Well  No  Okay, good  Well, um  No, but I  Obi, don't  Oh, don't even go there  No  We're just a bunch of assholes  We're all secretly hoping  Everyone  Each other self-destruct  No  We're just a bunch of dicks 
[03:15:00]  And we're able to talk about it  We kidding  Hey, remember that asshole?  Alright  Uh, Mega Million  So you got that  Uh, you got a big lottery thing happening  And, um  I could use, uh, water, though  That'd be good  Yeah  Yeah  I thought you were just tired from, um  Your Atlantic City thing  Well, I was  But I'd gotten enough sleep from that  But then it was different  It was like after I got home  Okay  And then, you know  Alright  Jimmy, um 
[03:15:30]  Oh, wait a minute  It's so embarrassing  Dude, it's in front of a live audience  Oh, no  What, our show?  Oh, that was like a little dribbler  A nibbler  There were two  Did you guys ever go into a  One of those  Thank you, sir  Rest pods?  What's a rest?  Oh, uh  Sensory deprivation chamber?  I was in a store in Huntington  Over the weekend  On Main Street  I just remember this  Um, and it's in the  Aromatherapy store  I don't own it or nothing  New age 
[03:16:00]  Stuff  Going on in there  Yeah  The lady in there is very, very nice  And she, uh  She's an Imus fan  And, uh  Imus has done this show  Uh, uh, uh  A world of good  Because so many people  Know me and you  Because Imus talks about us  This lady has never heard our show  But she goes  Oh, you're the one that Imus talks about  I've heard that from a lot of people  And I told her I was tired  I was going back to the hotel  Uh, to  You know, sleep  And she goes  Well, we got this, like  Uh, I forgot what it's called  It's like a rest pod  And you go in there 
[03:16:30]  And they  Rest pod  They throw, like, new age music in  And the bed heats up  To, like, 100 degrees  And then it shakes  Really fast  And then you get some of that REM sleep  For, like, 18 minutes or so  You're in there for about 40  But if you  If you do it right  You get about 15 minutes  Where your eyes are just blinking away  Like a motherfucker  That's, like, REM sleep, I guess  So I'm in there  And I'm doing the whole thing  And I have just my long johns on  Because I wasn't prepared  To go into the  The sleep pod  Oh, no  What are you supposed to wear 
[03:17:00]  In a sleep pod?  PJs or  Under  I sleep in the nude  Underpants  Why'd you go naked?  Uh, because I don't know  Who was in there before me  Is there fresh sheets?  Yeah, there was a sheet down  But  Yeah, I don't know  To start jacking off  As it's vibrating  I'll tell you true  There was a nice feeling  And, uh  All of a sudden  I thought I, um  I, I, I shit into my long johns  That is relaxing  And as I told my lovely fiancée afterwards 
[03:17:30]  Yeah  Another story where  Oh my god  She should probably just pack up and leave  Um  I  I was so relaxed  And half asleep  Half awake  You know the feeling you get  When you're finally, like, taking a dump  You just, like, you just  Alright, it's time to do it  I had that feeling  But I wasn't controlling the feeling  Cause you, you as a human  Are like, wait  I don't wanna do this right now  Yeah, you could clinch  Make sure nothing comes out  And then because I'm in a concealed pod  And there was some, like, older  Huntington bitch 
[03:18:00]  Waiting to use the pod after me  The fuckin' smell in there  Cause it was, it was  It was actually a fart  Oh  A really bad fart  But it came out  It came out, like, in a  In bubble form  You ever have a fart that comes out  In bubble form?  Anyone out there?  Bubble form farts, right?  He knows, okay  That I, I was convinced  I shit myself  And I was in a panic  And then the smell was horrific  And then I had to open up this  Oh, man  This, uh, space-age pod  To let the next person in  And release the fart 
[03:18:30]  But, uh, safe to say  That I did not, uh, shit in my long johns  Yeah, good thing  But the place stunk  Yeah, it did  Well, after I was done  And then I got some kind of  Aromatherapy thing  That, that  So did the person coming into the room  Yeah, shoot some kind of steam  Lavender steam into my bedroom  So I could sleep at night  I don't know  Ah  I don't know what the fuck I bought  My girlfriend bought me  Eucalyptus liquid soap  That I use with a loofah glove  No, you don't  I do, I loofah glove  Why do you loofah? 
[03:19:00]  Why don't you?  That's the question  See how I quickly lobbed  My gay thing back into your court?  Yes, you did  Loofah makes your skin nice and soft  Yes  Okay  Meet thousands of gay singers  Yes  With loofahs  That's right  What is the loofah supposed to do?  I don't know  It just makes you  Exfoliates  Oh, it exfoliates you  So you're nice and smooth  Exfoliates  Here's the  The Mega Millions thing  So we got a Mega Millions thing  Happened in New York  And the dumb local news  Wants to help you  If you  If you win the money 
[03:19:30]  Listen to how dumb this is  A nine digit paycheck  Imagine what you would do  With all that money  Well that's exactly the thing  When it's that much  It's sort of hard to grasp  What it's really worth  So in the case that you do win  And I'll keep my fingers crossed  We've put together a little shopping list  Roll out the Bentleys  Just how many of these  Could you buy with  One hundred seventy nine million dollars  Five  Oh, about five hundred forty two  That's the reaction we were hoping for 
[03:20:00]  By the way  Yeah, yeah  Just that  Wait, a hundred million dollars?  You could buy more than five hundred Bentleys  Um, no  I guess they're what?  They're saying they're what?  Two hundred thousand a piece, right?  Maybe  If we do the math real fast  Yeah  That's about right  Five hundred times  Ten of them  What?  Oh, all right, maybe  If cars aren't your thing  Cruise on over to the yacht world  Currently  A mysterious Russian billionaire  Is building a yacht 
[03:20:30]  Worth two hundred eighty million dollars  In Italy  So even if you won the mega million jackpot  You could only get a yacht  Half his size  So forget the yacht  Why not settle for a private island?  Prices range from ten to twenty million dollars  So at the very least  You could own nine islands  But if you're a successful movie star  Such as Reese Witherspoon  Who makes twenty million per picture  Each project is like winning the lotto  Reese only has to make nine movies  To earn the jackpot amount 
[03:21:00]  So they're making you do math  Just tell us it's a lot of money  You assholes  They try to put it in terms we can understand  We can understand just what you're winning  You don't have to turn it into anything else  Right  All right and finally  Reese Witherspoon gets twenty million a picture  Yeah  Oscar  No justice  She got an Oscar  Oh Oscar  She didn't deserve it by the way  Okay  What's she wearing for?  June Carter Cash  She was decent  Ah yeah  She was moderate at best  Yeah  Nah she was way better than Joaquin 
[03:21:30]  That's why she won it  Who wasn't?  Yeah  Old balloon knot lip  What?  Fucking suck  Oh yeah he whispers everything  The elders  I've talked to the elders  I walk the line  I walk the line  I do everything  Except what I should do  Which is break dance in front of the viper room  Like my brother  Fucking sucks  A pile of dicks  Dude  You want  Oh my god  You just reminded me of something  I was reading like one of those 
[03:22:00]  A pile of dicks  Well  Well yeah  In a way  Yeah in a way  Yeah I gotta say that  I was reading in the National Choir  Maybe we can find this  Holy shit  Who Merv Griffin had sex with  Over the years  Cause now  Everyone in Hollywood  Knew that he was gay  But he refused to officially admit  That he was gay  Yeah  And he died what  A few months back  Yeah  And they had the list of guys  He had sex with  And Marlon Brando  Supposedly they would live together  Here in New York  When they first started out  I'm trying to remember 
[03:22:30]  The other ones  Before I  I hit you with the biggie  Oh there's a biggie  Bigger than Brando  Who's talking out there  Who's talking  Oh  People are talking now  Point him out  No it's not the audience  Point him out  Point him out  Eastside Dave  Eastside Dave  Eastside  You probably didn't know  He had a mic on  Eastside Dave  Dave  ESD  Eastside Dave  Dave

[03:25:00]  One of his conquests  Was River Phoenix  Merv Griffin  According to this fucking article  No  Really  Wow very cool  This  Really  Yeah  I felt like Jimmy reading this article  I wanted to be in a bathroom puking  How did he get such a young boy  You gotta  I gotta read it word for word  Just how  It just will make you nauseous  He's a very powerful guy man  Merv Griffin could fucking  He left the room at a party  And said something  Like  A mission accomplished  Or something  Exactly  Maybe he just wanted to eat his ass 
[03:25:30]  Huh  Maybe he didn't want to fuck River  Maybe he just wanted to eat his ass  I bet you that's what he wanted to do  He probably saw my own private Idaho  And he just wanted to  That's exactly it  He probably wanted to bend him over  I bet you he wanted to open River's asshole  And just go like this  And breathe Merv breath onto River's bag  From the back  Coke Logic writes  Merv Griffin met the guys  Off an instant feedback banner  So  Oh  Thousands  And one of them 
[03:26:00]  Yeah  River Phoenix  Yeah  Mission accomplished  And if they put it in  Common man language  You could get  7,122,849 bottles  Of Jack Daniels  And one liter of coke  Oh  So now you understand  That it's a lot of money  Really mix drinks like that  Yeah  Still can't find it  We're looking  I might have it for tomorrow then  It's been some great spanking material  I'll share it with everybody tomorrow 
[03:26:30]  This should be  There's an article about  Merv's secret gay life  In the February 11th issue  Of the National Enquirer  Yes  Okay  This will be good enough  Griffin's close friend  And personal psychic  John Cohan  Claims Merv was gay  And he personally witnessed  Griffin seduce River Phoenix  After plying him with alcohol  At a party  Around 1991  So River Phoenix  Was fucking young man  Yeah  Yeah  He said Merv was instantly smitten  With the younger man  Having seen him in the film  My Own Private Idaho  Very good Jimmy  In which River played a gay street hustler 
[03:27:00]  Merv said I want to meet him  He was like an excited teenage boy  That was  Merv was an excited teenage boy  Sure he was  River Young  River was literally  Yeah  An excited young teenage boy  He probably had  That's  Well  I had a liver spotted cock  I'm working out a really gross line  But I'll tell you what I have so far  Oh right  You know River Phoenix  Was shaking outside the Viper room  And I'm thinking now  That he was trying to shake  The Merv Griffin semen  Out of his asshole 
[03:27:30]  That's probably not any well  Let me just give a little comedy tip  There's no way to clean that up  No  There's no way to make that Leno friendly  How do you say shake cum  Out of the asshole Jay  But network friendly  It wasn't that I was going  For a cleaner line Jimmy  I was going for a line  That maybe more people  Were to laugh at  Sorry  I was just trying to work it  To be maybe funny  Okay  So Cohen said  Toward the middle of the evening  Merv comes over to me  And says  I'm going to take a drink  To River  I said  Well go easy 
[03:28:00]  He's a fragile young kid  Watch it with the liquor  As the evening wore on  Cohen claims he saw River  And he said  Merv's giving me a lot of drink  I shouldn't be drinking this much  It was clear  Merv was trying to get him drunk  And he succeeded  I bet you Merv just wanted  To suck his cock  I bet you that's what Merv wanted  I bet you Merv didn't want  To fuck him in the ass  I bet you Merv just wanted  To fucking like  Look just slide your jeans  Down to the middle of your legs  And he probably took his  Warm older gentleman hands  And he probably  Cupped River's balls  And his dick was soft 
[03:28:30]  Because he'd been drinking  And he wasn't gay  But Merv popped that  Fucking cock  And sucked like  Fucking gay guys suck  Like  It was like a  Like a fucking  Holy shit  I bet you Merv made  Piglet noises  While he was fucking  Suckling  No I don't  You don't need a prop  You don't need a prop  Okay  No he was probably  I bet you he didn't even  Grab the dick  He probably just held  Those young balls  Older man nose  Hitting belly  On every fucking  Dower 
[03:29:00]  River couldn't help  But River probably came  Before he was hard  He was probably getting  Hard and shooting  Merv came out  Merv swallowed it all down  Not only did Merv swallow it  He went  And then he would  Fucking squeeze the balls  And try to milk it  On the dropout  As if it was liquid gold  Merv came out  From one of the rooms  And he was smiling  And he said  Mission accomplished  Yeah  Cohen asked Merv later  Why did you get him 
[03:29:30]  So drunk and do that  Merv said  Oh he's just so adorable  I couldn't resist  Maybe he just kissed him  Maybe he just wanted to  Fucking like  Lick his nipples  Or something  Or smell under his arms  Nah he probably did  Exactly what you said  Sucked his dick  Yeah cupping  And making the sounds  I could do anything  You need me to do  I bet you while he cupped  He would finger  He slipped his older  Gentleman finger under  And tickled his asshole  And River probably  Wasn't that used to  Having that done  And River was probably  Laying on the back stiff  Like alright  I'll just cut his mouth  Real quick and get  Another movie 
[03:30:00]  Like really sloppy  Sloppy and really fast  Today's instant feedback  Winner  I just decided  To start a new bit  Today  Is Rod J  I don't give a shit  What we've read  Up to this point  He writes  He's from Colorado Springs  He writes  Merv attacked River  Like E-Rock  Attacks sliders  Hey the article  Also says 
[03:30:30]  Merv had affairs  Okay Marlon Brando  Rock Hudson  Montgomery Cliff  Jesus  And some guy named  Gardner McKay  And it also says  Merv's marriage  To Julianne Elizabeth  Wright was a sham  To cover up his sexuality  Was it  So there you go  Fucking  I bet you  I bet you  When River started  Cumming  Merv gripped  Both River's legs  Because he was  As excited  To be taking  A mouthful  Like as he was 
[03:31:00]  Cumming  Merv probably  Grabbed his legs  And went  Oh god  He didn't spill a drop  Jimmy  Old Merv  Just  Jimmy  It seems like  You know a lot  About  Cock sucking  No no  Merv treated  River's cock  Are you creeping  Out the audience  Don't misunderstand  Okay  Merv treated  River's cock  The way anyone  Would want their  Cock treated  Very good 
[03:31:30]  You know  And that's how  I would want  My cock treated  Just not by Merv  Like what  No not by Merv  How would you  Like your cock treated  I want the balls  Cupped  And I want it  Really sloppy  And I want the  Hand and the  Mouth working  Together  Like this  And then  I want the  One  The jack in hand  To go  And he just  Holds the balls  And his mouth  I bet you his lips  Would open  Really wide  Like  And he would  Gobble the cock  Like his fucking  Mouth would  His mouth would  Clear the cock
