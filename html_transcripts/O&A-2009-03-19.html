<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a declaration of their unwillingness to be "nice," immediately followed by a vulgar and offensive segment targeting someone's mother.  The hosts then transitioned to a discussion of the TV show *Lost*, with one host expressing his intent to finally watch it.  A substantial portion of the broadcast centered on one host's plan to dispose of an old hard drive by dropping it from a helicopter into the Hudson River, despite claiming its contents were "boring."  This led to a discussion about changes in gun range safety regulations and a darkly humorous conversation about euthanizing terminally ill relatives.

The conversation then shifted to one host's experience of day trading stocks while on the toilet, boasting about significant profits from a single bowel movement. This segued into a discussion about Long Island's economic disparities and the state of the economy, including the impact on one host's brother working on Wall Street. Their own Sirius XM stock performance was also discussed, attributing its success to their show and a Jay Leno endorsement.

Comedian Jim Norton joined the show as a guest.  The conversation included a discussion of the AIG bailout, executive bonuses, and death threats against AIG executives. A significant portion of the broadcast was dedicated to an incident involving an intern, David, who was forcibly removed from the Ron and Fez show after being sent there by Opie.  This led to a lengthy discussion about Fez's past, including a story about being hosed down naked in his driveway as a child,  exploring themes of potential childhood trauma and referencing his nickname, "Fatty Pneumonia."  The show concluded with a song about "Fatty Pneumonia."

[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.

[00:04:00]  This, he's ledger.  I mean, there was going to be no surprise there.  It was so obvious he was going to win.  And I was disappointed.  I thought we were going to see a corpse.  Too soon.  Did you quit smoking yet?  No, I didn't quit smoking.  Why don't you guys attack him like you attack me?  We don't care if he dies.  We don't care about you.  Why don't you shove it?  Shove it like your mother did.  Shove it like your mother takes it.  Your mother, that whore. 
[00:04:30]  That whore.  Think of your mom.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  Think of your mom's sweet face.  You know what she does?  She's an effing whore.  She takes it in a dirty spot.  A dirty spot's a big gaping one.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wow, you were angry.  I have problems when I listen to that.  Wow, you were angry.  Man, there's no reason to attack somebody's mother like that.  No, even if it's true.  It's horrible, yes.  Even if it's true. 
[00:05:00]  It shouldn't be said.  It should be unspoken.  I love it, though.  Wow.  Absolutely love it.  Welcome.  You like the lost intro?  Yeah, I like that.  Yeah?  And the little vroom at the end makes me feel bad because that's when the episode's over.  Oh, really?  You got the big block letter lost, but it doesn't twirl.  Let's go home now.  And you're just, yeah.  And then you're just left with another week of waiting.  So we're doing it backwards?  Backwards.  But that makes sense if you're a Lost fan, I guess, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Just jumble it.  You know, you're looking at the clock.  It's one of those shows where you start looking at the clock and you go, that's the last segment.  God damn it.  You just get completely engrossed in that God effing show.  Man, when you get into a show, you want time to slow the F down.  That's what it is.  You're so right.  You look at the clock and it's like, wait, that's half the show's gone already.  Yeah.  And then, you know, it blasts you with commercials.  And, you know, everyone reminded me that Lost was on and I still got to do my bit. 
[00:06:00]  I've never seen an episode of Lost and I want to jump right in.  And I was going to jump in yesterday.  And I was going to take some very detailed notes for you Lost fans.  Oh, yesterday would have been a great episode last night for you to just jump in.  Does someone have a copy?  I can maybe still just jump in and do it tomorrow.  You'd just be so confused as to what was going on.  Oh, no, you figured the whole thing out?  I'll figure it all out for you guys.  You guys need a fresh, like a fresh mind. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, a fresh mind to look in and figure it all out.  Oh, you guys got all confused.  Based on one episode.  Dude, I bet you that's how it works.  I bet you, like a newbie like me or anyone else, I'm not even saying I have superpowers  when it comes to Lost or anything, but I bet you that they fuck up your brain so much  that there's no way you can figure it out.  But if all you have to do is watch one episode and you go, ah, this is obvious.  And it's like, oh, okay, I see.  This guy's this.  They've distracted us with a story, a character development is what they did. 
[00:07:00]  They've thrown you off.  You know, they've thrown you off.  Yeah.  So you'll be able to figure it out.  Yeah, easy.  But I'm kind of bummed because I had a dumb computer problem yesterday and the guy called  at 730 and, uh, like we were finally done at 915.  I'm like, I missed my opportunity to watch Lost, but he was doing some of that.  What is it?  The share view or whatever it's called.  Oh, creepy.  That is creepy.  Yeah.  It's like, okay, I'm now going to take control of your computer.  Just click yes.  If you want me to take control of your computer, I'm on the phone with the guy. 
[00:07:30]  Click yes.  And I know most people know about this, but it's the first time I actually saw it, you  know, happening.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden now he's rocking my mouse and I'm like, that is effing creepy, man.  Yeah, it really is.  When you see your, uh, your mouse just moving around or your little icon thing.  Yeah.  And I was telling Anthony, you got to know who you're talking to because he's, he's a nice  guy, but he's a computer geek from Long Island with a family and you know.  Yeah.  You know, he's excited to go to FH Riley's for the first time.  All right.  So, you know, not much is going on in his life. 
[00:08:00]  I'm sure he's happy.  So when he took over my, my computer, I wanted to make a quick little joke like, oh, don't  go to any kiddie porn sites while you have my computer.  But instead I got favorites if you do want to, but instead I, I, I went with, uh, oh, don't  go to ESPN and check any sports scores.  Do I have control?  Cause I didn't want to go with the big edgy joke, you know?  Cause I didn't know how he was going to take it.  Taking control of your computer, Dave. 
[00:08:30]  And you were funny.  You were funny when I was telling you this morning, like all of a sudden you just see  him copied and pasting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like there's things, cause you would know when he's doing his work, you don't know what  he's doing.  If he's just doing technical shit, cause a lot of people aren't that savvy with, with computers.  Right.  But if you just see him like copying and pasting your pictures and stuff, it's like,  this isn't, what does this have to do with my, no, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  He's like in your banking.  Right.  He's like online banking and you're just seeing your balance go down or something. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  You have access to this.  You have to have a lot of trust to do that, uh, share view, whatever the hell it's called.  Trust in yourself too.  And who uses your computer?  Yeah.  Oh, that's, that's how all those, those guys get caught having naughty stuff.  Naughty, naughty stuff.  It's always when they need the quick little repair and the guy goes, oopsie, what did we  find reciting here?  Yeah.  Oh, today's the day I go up in a helicopter, by the way.  What?  Cause I, uh, I switched out computers. 
[00:09:30]  I destroyed, uh, my computer except for my, uh, my old hard drive.  Oh yeah.  And there's honestly, there's nothing crazy on there, but I still don't trust a, uh, a human  soul on this planet.  Yeah.  I never trust my hard drive.  So I rented a, uh, helicopter and I'm, and I'm dumping it somewhere in the Hudson river  today.  And the Hudson along with some baggage and, uh, cameras and stuff from the, yeah.  Jimmy's like, what?  Sully's plane.  Yeah.  I figured, you know, they had a tough time finding that black box.  I saw them searching the river for days. 
[00:10:00]  So I figure, all right, what the hell?  So I'm going to be in a helicopter.  I'm going to drop it somewhere in the Hudson river today.  You can't just stand on the pier and give it a little skip.  Nope.  No, huh?  Too close to shore.  Too close.  I don't, you can throw it to Jersey.  Too close.  If it floats, it doesn't say on the news, a kiddie porn bonanza was found.  Bestiality in the Hudson.  We'll let you know what we mean.  You know, the panic you would feel if you threw it like from the shore and you see it just floating 
[00:10:30]  down the river.  Yeah.  And you realize you wrote your name and address on the bottom, right?  Oh, please, God, make it to the ocean.  Please, please, please, please.  By the way, people are checking in the fact that hard drives are sealed very tightly.  Oh, I understand that.  And I think it would take quite a while in the water for it to...  Oh, I understand that.  That's why it has to be...  I have to go on a helicopter and I have to drop it in the middle.  So it gets stuck in the muck at the bottom.  All that, yeah.  And I'll bang it a couple times before I...  Oh, yeah, you bang that hard drive.  I'm going to bang that hard drive.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't want some dumb diver that thinks he's going to have a little fun and jump  in the Hudson and find this thing.  I...  Just use a Makita drill.  And this is a hard drive that just has, like, maybe a few pictures.  Yeah, I bet.  No, not even...  I mean, just boring stuff.  Yeah.  But, you know, you feel like you're...  I feel like it's like Indiana Jones stuff when you're holding these hard drives.  Like, this is valuable.  You know what it is? 
[00:11:30]  Your hard drive is really what you've done and lived over the past...  If you upgrade your computer every couple of years...  This is about five years of stuff.  Then it's five years of your life put in there, and you don't know what's in there and what  isn't.  Right.  So passwords...  Right.  Banking things, transcripts, letters to the agent.  Just, like, things can be in there.  Just dumb stuff.  Yeah, but if it gets out...  I know I just have dumb stuff on there, but you still have that weird, oh, my God, I got 
[00:12:00]  to destroy this into a million pieces.  It's five years of your life on there in some way.  I was just going to hand it over to Club Soda Kenny because he's very trustworthy.  I'm like, nope.  No, huh?  Nope helicopter.  It's going to cost me a few shuckles today.  You're going to hang it down at the range and...  That'd be cool.  Give a few blasts into it.  Well, when you invite me to the range, we'll shoot it up.  Oh, 50 cal.  We'll shoot it up.  50 cal right through it.  I don't think they could read it after that. 
[00:12:30]  Are we allowed to do that?  Yeah, we'll probably get yelled at.  What's up with gun ranges?  You've got to, like, make it a little more fun.  They used to out of Calverton, man.  You could bring anything out there.  Really?  Yeah, washing machine.  You can just dump it out in the field and open fire on it.  So what happened?  Ah, they kind of got, I think, insurance problems.  You know, where people are just walking out there throwing propane canisters out and  blasting it with a shotgun.  You know exactly what happened.  Obama?  Lawyers.  Yeah, lawyers.  Ah, you can't blame Obama for everything. 
[00:13:00]  I'd try.  I know.  I understand that, and that's okay.  Both sides got to be represented.  But I guarantee it was a lawyer.  Yeah.  A lawyer goes, you can't have people shooting at washing machines.  And then the person that owns the gun range probably said, this is how it always works,  like with us and radio.  Well, why not?  And they don't really have a good reason why not, but they still get their way.  They just say, yeah, well, it's a problem.  Now you're stuck with a dumb little paper target.  And you got to go out there with your stapler gun.  And you have to bring your own stapler gun and staple the targets on the little wood things 
[00:13:30]  that are out in the field and then walk back.  How depressing.  It used to just be, I swear, people would bring down everything and anything to just  blast away at out of Calverton.  You should be able to take your relatives.  Yeah, well.  That are ready to pass on to the other side.  And just firing squad them.  Yeah, as long as they're willing to sign the paperwork.  You know, is it a great.  How cool would that be? 
[00:14:00]  What, what?  Just take out your relatives.  If they got some terminal thing and, you know, they're going to time it perfectly where  they only got a weekend left.  They're like, all right, pick me up.  This is this.  I think they allowed that for like a week.  This is it.  Out there at Calverton.  Because everyone would be horrified.  You're taking out your aunt you never liked.  Watch them slouch over into that death fall.  Holy Jesus.  That would be awful.  But they signed the paperwork.  Yeah.  I'm not, you know.  You got to stick to your own targets now. 
[00:14:30]  It used to be if somebody brought something real fun to shoot at, you could, like, you'd  get people down the entire stretch of the line.  It was a long firing line shooting at one target in the middle of the field.  That's cool.  What's wrong with that?  They just unload on it.  Now, you know, not so much.  Huh.  They get a little crazy now with safety.  Right.  But, like you said, probably some lawyers got in there.  Of course they did.  They ruin everything.  Yeah.  And then, I don't know where the pushback is going to happen with that. 
[00:15:00]  I haven't, I don't know.  That's scary.  Bring a lawyer to the range.  Maybe we start there.  Well, you think there's a, you think there's a market for, like, a whole new group of lawyers  that could push back these, uh, these asshole lawyers that are ruining everything?  The ones that took all the fun away?  Just litigate everything that's fun and exciting and a little, maybe a little element of danger  to it, but you're doing it because of that?  Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Kind of need that.  Did you really make money on the toilet yesterday?  Yes, I did.  This is, uh, the, to me, this spells 2009. 
[00:15:30]  This is the age we live in.  This is the future.  No flying cars.  We, we understand that.  A lot of things we expected in the future.  Not here.  Right.  We kind of got robbed with, uh, things.  You still look down the street, you see wires on telephone poles.  Thought that would be gone.  Right.  Thought there'd be microwaving energy into our houses.  Things like the house of the future from the World's Fair.  Your woman won't even have to do the wash.  She just throws the laundry in this bin. 
[00:16:00]  It biodegrades it and makes brand new clothing.  She doesn't even have to push the button.  A Negro can do it.  Because that's the future.  Lucky Strike.  The future's sponsored by Lucky Strike.  Yeah, the good old days when they thought the future would be like this very utopian looking thing with flying cars.  But the future to me really, yesterday, uh, I really saw the vision of the future. 
[00:16:30]  Um, I was sitting on the bowl, taking a dump with my, uh, iPhone.  Liquid-y or nice solid?  Yeah, it was a nice one.  Yeah, yeah.  One piece that tapers?  One piece, toothpaste-y.  Nice.  Nice.  Tooth-paste-y?  Well, harder than toothpaste.  But it had that slide like toothpaste.  Slides out like a snake?  Where it just, yeah, yeah.  No, no.  Are those the best or what?  No pushing and shoving.  Right down to the tiny little snake tail?  Like, ah.  No, all of a sudden, for some reason, the muscles give out on pushing and decide, I'm just gonna stop here. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Like, no, you're not done yet.  Yeah.  Keep it going.  You can't stall your car in the tunnel.  Yeah, what are you doing?  My ass is not a paper cutter.  This is gonna cause a lot of stress in the system.  Yes.  I'll be wiping for hours if I have to do that.  And your ass can only hold on for so long before it has to clinch.  By the way, this isn't the future I'm talking about.  Just a good discussion about a dump. 
[00:17:30]  Yes.  All right, so you're doing your thing.  Doing my thing.  I have my iPhone right there in my hand.  And I'm on the E-Trade site on my iPhone.  And I'm trading stocks.  Wow.  And I noticed one of my stocks was doing very well.  I had options in it.  And I decided, wealthiest U.S. towns.  All right.  For real?  I think I make it.  For real?  I think I'm in.  Yeah.  Nice. 
[00:18:00]  Wow.  Five of the top ten are in fucking Long Island?  Nassau.  Nassau is ridiculous.  Well, I see number 14 up there.  Yeah, Nassau County's crazy.  Ridiculous.  That's not for the world.  Trust me on the taxes.  No, the U.S.  The U.S., yeah.  That's for the, I mean, that's for the United States?  Yes.  Five wealthiest towns in the U.S.  Or in Nassau County.  Yeah.  In the U.S.  Crazy.  In the country.  Wow.  Wow, that's insanity.  Nassau County, for the people out there, is like half of Long Island.  There's Nassau County.  The other half, Suffolk.  Yeah.  And it's, and the taxes really reflect on that too, believe me.  And the beauty of Suffolk, they probably have the five worst towns in all of the United 
[00:18:30]  States.  Well, you get what you pay for, if you know what I mean.  A nice little balance going on on Long Island, but anyway.  Ding, ding.  Yeah.  You get what you pay for.  Yeah.  So I was trading some options, and I noticed one of my stocks were up, and I did a little  trading on my iPhone.  And before I was done with my duty, I had traded a stock and threw a lot of money in 
[00:19:00]  my portfolio right there from the toilet bowl.  Can you, I know you don't want too much, you got to tell us how much, sort of.  Well, it was, it was.  In the way of, hmm.  It was a few grand.  A few G's?  Yeah.  A few G's.  For one dump's work?  Yeah.  One dump's work.  Oh, are you pissing people off today?  I've been working the market for about, I jumped back in a few months back.  Yeah.  And my average is, I'm doing pretty good. 
[00:19:30]  I'm up, I'm up a hundred percent on my initial investment as of yesterday.  One hundred percent on my initial investment.  I only made one investment, I was up 154 percent.  Really?  It was our own company.  Yes.  By the way, Sirius, if you got into Sirius when they were down to, what, nine, ten,  eleven, twelve, thirteen cents?  I think I got into like a fourteen or fifteen cents.  Fourteen cents.  Look at you, Jimmy.  And they jumped.  What's going on?  And did you punch out or is it paper money for you right now?  I didn't punch out.  Should I?  You didn't punch out? 
[00:20:00]  No, I don't know.  See, that's just it.  You're never going to buy at the absolute low and punch out at the absolute high.  Yeah.  But I've gotten greedy before and just eaten my balls.  What's that now?  Thirty-nine, was it?  Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.  A little bit.  It was in the forties for a little bit.  I got to, you know, we got to start really patting ourselves on the back because it was pointed  out to me by more.  Yeah, let's all do that.  Feels good.  Feels good.  Another man does it.  It was pointed out to me by many people that the Sirius stock went up drastically the 
[00:20:30]  day we were pushed back to full-time satellite radio.  Well, a gentleman once said.  And it's about time we start patting ourselves on the back and taking a little credit for our  talent.  But I do recall recently a gentleman said something about our show.  Oh, right.  I can't remember what it was.  Something about the notoriety or whether it was liked by many. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, you know what?  It was something about.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A lot of people enjoyed it.  But I'm paraphrasing here.  In the top ten.  Which one?  Something like that.  Which one?  I got a whole pile of these people just praising us.  This was a West Coast compliment.  Oh, the latest one.  The latest one.  I believe it was some gentleman.  My name is a very popular comedian.  You can hear him every morning on the Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show 
[00:21:30]  in the history of satellite radio.  Yes.  His new DVD, HBO's Down and Dirty with Jim Norton, will be available April 7th.  And please welcome Jim Norton.  Jimmy, can I tell you, you know, Jay Leno wouldn't lie.  No, I wouldn't.  I wouldn't.  And somebody pointed out on the old Twitter last night that it has to be true because Jay  Leno has a microphone in front of him.  Yeah.  And what did we teach you guys about microphones?  You have a microphone in front of you.  It has to be true.  And the president of these United States of America is going to be on his show, I believe, 
[00:22:00]  tonight.  Now, would the president go on a TV show?  A lying sack of shit show?  No.  Not the president.  Hell no.  Our president.  Who I am loving right now, by the way.  Oh, why?  I'm not agreeing with all this stuff.  Go watch Obama Deception.  I don't.  I like the fact that he's destroyed my love for Obama.  With one lousy phone call.  Isn't that odd that Patrice did that?  One lousy phone call.  I don't care. 
[00:22:30]  The bottom line is that he's attacking these guys, even though, I'm not saying he's going  to fix all the problems, but man, I love the fact that he is making these motherfuckers,  he is really just turning rocks over and exposing these scumbags.  AIG.  Oof.  What dummies.  They get a bailout from the government, billions of dollars, and they hand over bonuses to executives.  A bonus is supposed to be for doing something good.  You get a bonus. 
[00:23:00]  It's not, your company was so broke, the government had to bail you out.  What did you, how did you earn a bonus?  On taxpayers' fucking money.  80% of it the government owns, and it's also, people are sending death threats to these people.  Oh, hell yeah.  You know, I would never encourage people to do things, but I'm not saying it's happening.  No, people are getting death threats, some of these executives.  So they said they have to give it back.  If not, they're going to tax their bonuses at a rate of 90%.  Yeah, if the government gave you more than $5 million. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That they will tax you at 90%, which means you're pretty much giving your bonus money to the  government who initially gave the money to you.  Good.  Although you are keeping 10%.  Some of them, it's weird, because some of these guys are probably like executives that  were actually good at their jobs, who would have left, who had to be convinced to stay.  But they're screwed too then.  It would have been a bankrupt company, they would have gotten, no one would have gotten  anything.  Right.  So it's like, at least be grateful you got jobs.  Like, those fucking dirt bags. 
[00:24:00]  The economy took out my brother, Quinn.  Is he fired?  Wall Street guy.  Huge Wall Street guy.  He was Bear Stearns, right?  He, when Bear Stearns completely collapsed, he was one of the lucky ones where he got,  he got picked up immediately.  He's, my brother's very talented.  I don't talk about that brother that much, because he's like a normal guy.  Normal, healthy dude.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with him.  But he's like, he's been a Wall Street guy for many, many years, and the economy took  him out like Monday or Tuesday.  Well, let me tell you what he should do.  Sit on the goddamn toilet.  Well.  Because it used to be what? 
[00:24:30]  You had to run down Wall Street with your little sheet of paper.  Sell.  Yeah.  Sell Mortimer.  Now, you can do it as you shit.  I don't even have conversations with the guy on the phone, because that's how good  he was.  Yeah.  I don't want anything being interpreted as him giving me info.  A little insider info.  You don't want that.  He knows what he's doing.  He'll land on his feet.  He's one of these guys like, yeah, I saw it coming, and I'll be just, he's one of these  guys, I'll just be fine.  Yeah.  He just knows that he'll get something else, and he sort of likes that he's going to 
[00:25:00]  get a break, a break in the action.  Yeah.  But it took him out, and he was one of, in his field, he was one of the best.  One of the best.  And not one of these scumbaggy Wall Street guys.  Yeah, yeah.  There are normal guys down there, believe it or not.  A lot of them are normal dudes.  I noticed something going on.  It runs the gamut, that's for sure.  Something's going on with the market.  Because like I said, I jumped back in when everything was crashing.  I thought I saw some bargains, bought a few, and they went even more bargain-y, which isn't 
[00:25:30]  good.  But I'm seeing something with the stock market.  Like, even though it does have its big ups and downs, people are kind of, there's a little  more confidence in the market than there was.  I'm kind of feeling that.  But a lot more people are jumping in, and it doesn't seem as scary with certain stocks  to put your money in.  And the financials, some of the banks and stuff have been going up. 
[00:26:00]  They're realizing now that the banks are making a profit, where they thought they were just  doomed.  The auto industry is still fucked.  But the financial thing, like the stock I was trading was Bank of America.  And I wish I hadn't traded on the shitter, because I kind of bailed out a little earlier  than I should have.  Because by the end of the day, it really took a nice jump.  So you were wishing that you were a little more clogged up.  I wish I was a little constipated.  If I was constipated yesterday, I would have made a lot more money. 
[00:26:30]  You think that's actually the truth?  Yeah.  Wow, that's...  Because as you're on the dumper, I looked behind me, and I had read all of my American  Rifleman magazines.  So I needed to read something, because you're on the shitter, and I pull out the old iPhone.  It's great, you know, while you're taking your dump.  And I realized, ooh, the market's still open, and I'm in this stock.  Let me see how it's doing.  And I saw it was doing very well.  So I'm like, you know something?  No chances, no bullshit.  Let's just punch out. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  So I did that, and then I checked it again when I woke up from my little nappy, and I shouldn't  have traded through the nappy, because it really, it jumped up even higher.  But like I said, you're not getting out at the top, and you're not getting in at the  bottom.  As long as you're making money, feel good about it.  You know what's funny about that?  You know my dumps and how they go?  I could do it within less than a minute, so...  You'd be just day trading all day on the toilet.  Well, we call it dump trading, you know.  Dump trading.  I can't be one of those dump traders.  A dump trader. 
[00:27:30]  It's officially a dump trader.  I'm a dump trader.  Can you dump trade every day?  I want to dump trade.  That's our new bid.  I should just dump trade.  Do a dump trade update every day, because you're back in, kind of.  Find a good pump and dump stock.  Yeah.  And you can only work the stock.  That's where you jerk off, take a shit, and trade.  It's a pump and dump.  Yeah.  Start doing dump trading.  I'll do some dump trading.  And you've got to update us every day.  But you can only trade as that is happening.  As that's happening. 
[00:28:00]  Okay.  Right now, you're 4,000 up.  4,000 or 5,000.  What are you up?  A few thousand?  Well, a few, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I took, you know, I took a certain investment.  And it's what, you know, it's an e-trade thing.  So it's like, yeah, you throw it in there.  You see what happens.  All right.  Good.  You know.  We got the chart.  Serious stocks since leaving KROQ.  I see.  Wow.  I see an uphill there, my friends.  Look at that.  I see an uphill.  Maybe Jay Leno was onto something.  He certainly was.  What was it when we, just before we left?  15.  It was 15. 
[00:28:30]  And now what is it?  37.  37.  There you go.  We're making people money.  We certainly are.  We're making people money.  I kind of want to stick with it.  Because it's like, I invested a couple of grand.  Nothing too much that I can't lose.  It was like, I said, let me just do it.  Because it was low.  Yeah.  And it's like, you kind of want to support your company.  And it's like, I think things are getting better.  And this is just another stalking.  Because the guys made off going to jail.  And because of people calling these scumbags out.  I think people feel better like.  A little more confident.  They're not going to be able to do the same shit they've been doing for all these years. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  People are a little more confident in investing these days.  Just at the very beginning of this.  And again, it could just fucking crumble today.  Who knows?  We'll see what happens.  You don't even know.  DW writes, we went back to the Jay thing for a second here.  Because the instant feedback is pretty good on that.  Jay said, O&A is one of the greatest treats of all time.  Wow.  Lili.  Exactly.  And then Steven asks from Bayshore, Jay Leno's giant chin is filled with nothing but truths. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, man.  Is that getting under someone's skin?  Yeah.  He'll make believe it doesn't.  And that it's something else.  It's always about you, isn't it?  It's got to be.  Always.  Wait till you hear it about 100 times in the next year.  Um, also, uh, after, after Lost, I watched, uh, South Park last night.  Was it good?  Yeah.  Really funny one.  It was a superhero based one.  Yeah.  And all they did was talk like Christian Bale as Batman. 
[00:30:00]  They fucking did the bit.  With the voice.  All of them had the voice on.  Do you feel like people listen to our radio show?  I don't know.  It's one of those things where certain people you know don't.  Yeah.  But other ones, you're just kind of like, all right, you know.  You don't want to do a hoo-hoo because it's so-  Hoo-hoo-hoo!  That's so lame.  But there are times where you watch TV and go, that was kind of a unique thing we were doing.  Yeah, we were kind of doing that whole thing, like right from the start.  The one that got me going, I think it was Family Guy, before it got canceled, your old 
[00:30:30]  Tyson bit where you did Tyson Spelling Bee.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they did a Tyson Spelling Bee type of thing.  I'm like, that's a little, that's sort of obscure.  Yeah, and he was throwing numbers in.  Because Tyson never officially ever spelled anything.  No, I don't think that was part of what he did.  That was a unique concept that Ant came up with.  You know, how would it sound like if Tyson was spelling?  And that was, if we could find that clip from Family Guy, I'm like, what the?  Yeah.  It's a little close. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, wow.  Some of the things are pretty close.  And every once in a while, like, every once in a while, either on a Family Guy or a South  Park, your eyebrows go up a little bit.  Like, what?  Wait a minute.  What was that?  Oh.  Yeah, so they were doing that whole superhero.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, with the rough boy.  Very funny one.  Cartman as a superhero.  It was just, he was dressed like a raccoon.  And his superhero name was The Coon. 
[00:31:30]  So, yes, he was running around.  As The Coon.  As The Coon.  And is The Coon needed?  I wish The Coon was here to help us.  Oh, my.  Yeah, they just don't, they do not give a shit what they've put on it.  It's good to see that those guys got their FU money.  When you get that FU money, life's a lot easier.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah, so that was funny.  You know, South Park's one of those shows.  I think it happens to everybody.  All of a sudden, you just check out of a show for no reason whatsoever. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  And that's what I did with South Park.  I got to jump back in.  Yeah.  Last night was the first episode I watched in a long time.  And it was really funny.  They were trying to find out the identity of Mysterio or one of these, like, superheroes  that one of the other kids were.  Right.  And Cartman's all mad at him because this Mysterion or Mysterio guy was getting all the credit  as a superhero.  And Cartman's like, but I'm the king.  And, you know, he wasn't getting all the credit.  And the newspaper, you know, coverage and everything.  So, he was trying to search down the true identity. 
[00:32:30]  And he hooked up with, what's his name?  Chaos.  Butters.  Yeah.  Butters.  Butters was, what's his name?  Professor Chaos.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah.  And they finally unmasked this Mysterion, Mysterio kind of character.  And it was like, oh, my God, I can't believe it's you.  And it was just, you know how all of them look the same?  Yeah.  Except for their clothes.  Yeah, of course.  Like, all the South Park characters look the same. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  So, you just saw his face.  He took the mask off and it's his face.  And he goes, oh, my God, I can't believe it's you.  And they never said who it was.  Oh.  So, because all their faces are the same.  It could have been Kyle.  It could have been Stan or anybody else.  So, they left you hanging like that.  It was a very, very funny episode, though.  But, like I said, it started out just the whole Jimmy thing with the voice.  Every time they were talking to each other, it isn't the Christian Bale voice.  Yeah, we pushed that concept out there pretty good.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Maybe that was an obvious one.  I don't know, though.  No.  I don't know.  I don't think people found it as disturbing as they did until Jimmy just relentlessly ragged on it.  And put it over the top.  Yeah, yeah.  It's terrible.  Let me go to Dave in Israel.  Dave.  David.  Hey, David.  Oh, we have a David update?  Hold on.  I'm using...  Whatever.  Oh, my God.  It's all right.  Go ahead, David.  Let's just talk about what you boys talked about right now, how they had Obama on.  And right away, they were bringing up the coon. 
[00:34:00]  And what you guys were saying, they got a bunch of fuck you money.  All right.  Thanks, David, for adding to the discussion.  Really?  Oh, he called from Israel.  He's a little behind.  He's got to take the call from Israel.  Well, you see a call from Israel.  You're like, wow, we're international radio stars.  You've got to take the call.  And then you get that.  To prove to the fans that, look, we're heard all over the world.  And then you get that.  Then you get that.  Andy in Rochester, the home of Brother Weez.  What's up, Andy?  Hey, Mr. Opie.  How are you doing?  Pretty good, Andy. 
[00:34:30]  So I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm 100% with you, that the rest of the world  is listening to your show.  There was a bit on Saturday Night Live a couple weeks back where they were doing a Donald  Trump thing.  It was right after you guys had Dice on your show.  And it was pretty obvious because the Trump guy was calling people a douche.  You know what?  I didn't mean to do that.  I haven't done that in a really long time.  Poor bastard.  He just got it.  I really didn't. 
[00:35:00]  What happened?  Ah, whatever.  Should I get too technical?  There's two banks.  And sometimes I try to clean out some phone lines.  And I was supposed to use like bank.  Why would you go to the bank, though, for a phone line?  I don't understand.  I haven't done that in a long time.  I used to do that to celebrities.  We're listening to them and I'm trying to clean up phones.  And all of a sudden they're gone.  And it's like, what the fuck's wrong with you?  Any call back?  We'll get the rest of your story.  Some kind of SNL bit.  You're right on.  For sure.  I was going to say we have a David update.  We can do it now if you want. 
[00:35:30]  Get it out of the way.  Oh, my God.  David's not here for the people that hate David.  There's a thing going on with David.  People, I mean.  Is there?  Yeah.  But this one is, there's no gray area.  They either love him or hate him.  There's no in between like, ah, he's all right.  Yeah, whatever.  People get excited when he's on the air.  And people go, holy shit, I can't take another David bit.  Yeah.  So, we don't know what to do about that, to be honest with you.  Eh, we just keep fucking putting him right in your face.  But Sam, we got a David update. 
[00:36:00]  He's not here, but.  Right.  But he did, you instructed him yesterday to go on the Ron and Fez show.  Yeah.  Yes.  And introduce Scott, the new MVP intern.  Yeah.  Now.  Because he is the new MVP.  He got the highest grade, right?  Yes, yes.  Scott got an A minus.  A minus from David.  See, but the thing is, Ron Bennington hates David.  Right.  No, because Opie got an email.  Right, yeah.  While the show was on that Ron said.  You forgot about that.  Ron said he doesn't hate David anymore and he would like to meet Scott at some. 
[00:36:30]  I believe that was an erroneous email.  Really?  Yes.  Because Ron is not a fan of David.  And, as a matter of fact, Ron never wants to see David while Ron is doing his program.  Yeah.  And Opie telling him to go in and not even ask about it.  He said, Ron wants you to just barge into the show.  Well, I made it perfectly clear that give Ron a few minutes to just get into some kind 
[00:37:00]  of good conversation.  Yeah, yeah, conversation.  You know, because he likes to warm up before he really starts rocking on his radio show.  And that would be a perfect time to get in there because then, you know, Ronnie's, you  know, rocking on all cylinders.  Right.  Hence, actually, interrupting probably a really good bit that he was in the middle of.  Yes, interrupting Ron's train of thought.  I believe, yeah, you told him to wait until they pick up some steam so they can get the  show going and then go in.  And then just open the door and come in with this new super intern. 
[00:37:30]  And probably the worst advice you could give young David because.  But he likes to listen to us.  And I heard he did just that yesterday.  He did.  He was nervous about doing it.  And none of us were going to be here because we all had to go to Sirius for a meeting.  But before we left and a bunch of the interns, we assured him.  I told him, David, what you have to do, Ron and Fez don't like cues.  Like they don't like to do things.  So there won't be a cue.  Yeah, yeah.  You just have to do this between 12, 15 and 12, 20. 
[00:38:00]  To fly by the seat of their pants kind of show.  Yeah.  You just got to barge in.  And was he hiding?  And so he said, okay, yeah.  Yeah.  And we told him he couldn't let Ron see him.  Right.  So he was hiding.  So he was in the back.  As soon as the coast is clear, he doesn't have to see David.  Then Danny told him, David, when you go in there, you got to sell Scott.  You have to make them know that Scott's the number one guy.  And he sat David down and told him to go on YouTube and watch all Jimmy Hart promos from  WWF.  So he knew how to sell someone.  Oh, shit.  So David said, okay. 
[00:38:30]  So he was all set.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So then we found out what happened was David.  We have the audio, by the way.  Okay.  I haven't heard the audio.  You want to?  Well, I don't know.  I'll explain.  David, he took one step in the door.  Well, do we want to play the audio first and then you could like go inside the audio?  Yeah.  And then go inside the audio?  Yeah.  So yeah, because that's the setup.  So David, all excited.  Yes.  He thought that I really got an email from Ronnie.  And he was getting ready to do the wrestling manager thing.  Like he was getting ready to go in and just, this is Scott, the new MVP intern. 
[00:39:00]  I'd be more happy to see a home invader come through my door.  He would be treated nicer than Ronnie treated David.  And David's like, it's got to be true because Opie said he got an email from Ronnie, right?  Yeah.  All right.  And this is what happened on the Ron and Fez show yesterday, noon to three, of course.  I can't take it anymore, Fez.  It's going on too long.  You and that fucking witch doctor, psychiatrist, have done nothing to get better. 
[00:39:30]  And you have now taken me to the point of aggravation.  I can't put up with it anymore.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to kill you.  I've had regressions.  Yes, I'll admit that.  But, you know, I...  You think I'm fucking around.  I'm in Scott.  You think that...  What is he doing in here?  Tell this motherfucker out.  Tell this motherfucker out.  What the fuck are you doing in here?  Tell this motherfucker out.  Throw him out.  Throw him out.  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:40:00]  We just threw out David, the O&A intern.  Tried to come walking in here in a good mood.  He may need a new pair of Hagar slacks.  Jesus Christ.  What a good time to walk in.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Ronnie, it wasn't a happy break that Ronnie was doing anyway.  He was, like, you know, not in the best of moods.  And then David walks in.  You could hear him as he's walking in going, come in, Scott.  Come in.  Because Scott told me he was kind of hanging behind David. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  And then once David stepped in and Scott saw Ron take his glasses off and look up and go,  what the fuck are you doing in here?  Scott just moved right back as if he was not involved.  It's just David.  And you could hear David going, Opie told me, Opie told me, Opie told me in the background.  And Ronnie didn't hear that.  We do have one more clip.  Okay.  Well, no, no, no.  If you have one more clip.  Oh, that's great.  Well, Paul, the intern, wants to jump in on this. 
[00:41:00]  Paul, of course, who Ron and Fez love.  Paul, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  The best part of the whole thing is Mr. Joe, as he's escorting David to the door,  asks me to get David's stuff and take him downstairs.  When we get outside, he goes, well, I don't know if it was a bit or not,  but I never got to tell Ron what Opie said.  Unbelievable.  What a dummy.  Thank you, Paul.  No problem.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:41:30]  Eastside Dave.  You know how David doesn't like to be touched?  Yeah.  Like, you can't even pat him on the back?  Yeah.  Eastside Dave picked him up and threw him out of the studio.  Oh, yeah.  Eastside Dave's the enforcer.  Yeah, and then Master Joe came.  I think this is what this clip is saying.  Master Joe came to physically remove him from the building.  All right.  Hey, Davey boy.  Yeah.  Talk to Master Joe and have David, the intern, removed from the building.  You got it, boss.  Removed from the building and let David, the intern, know I'm taking this to the highest 
[00:42:00]  fucking place.  I will.  Let him know I have fucking had it, and this is going to the highest place that we have  in XM.  I always like treating people exactly the opposite as they're treated on the ONA show.  Why?  It confuses them.  It absolutely confuses them.  And then they think to themselves, what is reality?  And Master Joe finally got to throw somebody out.  Just a little look on his face when me and Dave bum-rushed him. 
[00:42:30]  Dave, boy, that was the best.  He looked like he was going to throw up.  He's quivering right now in the hallway, and he should be.  He should be.  We didn't even give him a second break.  Is he out of the place?  Yeah, Joe was walking, and he said, but I need my jacket.  And I said, you maggot interns, get him his stuff and bring it down to him, but he's  out of this fucking building right now.  All I could hear was, but, but, Opie.  But, but, Opie. 
[00:43:00]  But, but, Opie.  But, but, Opie.  Well, I came over when I heard this happen to check on the situation, and I talked to  Master Joe, the security guard, about what happened, and he said what broke his heart  was David saying, but I didn't get a chance to, Opie told me to.  And then he's like, David, I think you got to go, man.  We'll take care of all this.  You know, when you're back on Friday, but don't worry.  And David turned around and looked at Master Joe and said, but Opie wouldn't lie to me. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, oh, no.  And he just walked to the elevator, shaking his head, saying, Opie wouldn't lie to me.  Opie told me.  I was just doing what Opie said.  Does he listen to the show?  Right.  He thinks, he thinks, you would lie to him, Ant.  Yes.  Opie would not.  Yeah, of course.  Exactly.  Well, he's got it right, I think.  I think so.  I would absolutely lie to him.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Hey, Opie, if it's not David's autopsy results, I don't want to hear it. 
[00:44:00]  So I guess he's not on Team David.  No.  Stephen S. isn't part of Team David?  Apparently not.  Very surprised by that.  Yes.  Very surprised knowing Stephen Bayshore.  That's really good.  All right.  Bravo.  And that's how it went down on the Ron and Fez show yesterday.  Of course, noon to three.  Ronnie wasn't happy, huh?  No, he was not.  He doesn't even.  He starts shouting when David is just, like, there.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Like, David can be outside.  Yeah, behind the glass.  He doesn't like it.  Yeah.  So, when David just walked in out of nowhere.  And they were having a serious moment on that show.  Yeah, and you just hear, come on, Scott.  Come on, Scott.  That was no Ichiban or any of that crap.  No.  No Ichiban.  That was Ichiban.  That was getting to some of Fez's stuff.  That was no old board gossip segment.  What, is he annoyed that Fez keeps regressing?  Yeah, I guess he's just sick of Fez's therapist not to curing him or something. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why, does Fez keep crying?  I don't know.  I guess so.  He sounded better recently than he has.  Jay Moore made him cry.  Well, Jay Moore is a bully to Fezzy.  He is the bully.  He's the playground bully.  And Fezzy is the poor, little, chubby kid on the playground.  Oh, you're going to make him cry.  No, no.  I know they're going to play this now, and Fez is going to cry.  But I don't mean that literally. 
[00:45:30]  I mean it figuratively.  I mean it like it was probably in the old days when he was fatty pneumonia.  Oh, jeez.  Don't bring that up.  What are you doing?  Fatty pneumonia.  Why would they call him that?  Oh, they would call him fatty pneumonia.  Fez.  Anthony doesn't mean this.  He doesn't mean this.  Why would they call him that?  Well, because he was a chubby little kid.  Oh, my God.  No.  Don't do this.  But it's way back in the days when he used to have to stand naked in the driveway after  going to the beach so he could be hosed off of the sand and embarrassed in front of his 
[00:46:00]  entire neighborhood as he stood there.  And the kids called him fatty pneumonia as he was being sprayed with a hose nude in his driveway.  I can't believe you're bringing this up.  Who would spray him naked?  It's humiliating.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  It's humiliating.  To his family?  Yeah.  Oh, don't do this.  Yeah.  Because he had sand and they don't want sand in the house.  And they didn't want poor little Fezzy dragging sand in the house.  So they'd make him take his little bathing suit off and stand nude in the driveway as they 
[00:46:30]  hosed him down.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  It was probably very traumatic.  That probably gave him shame issues that he carries this day.  He can't go into the bathroom here at the facility.  He can only go to the bathroom at home.  Oh, God.  It's tragic.  No, turn off this tape.  Ronnie, don't do this.  Does he hate his parents?  That's probably something he's sorting out with a therapist.  I'm not sure of the details.  But I would think there has to be some type of resentment there if you're standing out 
[00:47:00]  in a driveway nude while kids taunt you as you're being sprayed with a hose as a chubby  little child.  You can stop this at any moment.  He was probably adorable as a little chubby kid.  I'm trying to be nice.  You go to the beach.  Oh, my God.  Ronnie.  Yeah.  You want to have fun.  Right.  You feel a part of.  Stop the tape.  When I stay at the beach.  Yeah.  And you come home where it's supposed to be safe.  Yeah.  I give up.  And you're humiliated.  And they say, I'm sick.  Ronnie.  And you're humiliated. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like.  Sick, Ronnie.  How could he then take the next time that he goes to the beach and go like, oh, wow,  I'm going to the beach.  I'm going to have fun.  When all he's thinking is, I'm going to be little fatty pneumonia getting hosed down in  the driveway.  Uh, you know, it, it, it's not a, it's probably not a happy memory.  If the place you're supposed to be safest.  Right.  Is a source of humiliation and shame.  There's a problem there.  Then how can, like you just said, you feel good about anything because the end of your 
[00:48:00]  day is always going to be there.  So you could start off feeling good about yourself and having fun with your friends.  Yeah.  But if you're always going to think like, I'm going to be called fatty pneumonia, that's  a terrible thing to be called.  It's a terrible name.  It's horrible.  And Jay Moore is a, is a bully when it comes to Fez because he, he brings things up like  this in a bad way.  I bring it up to try to help Ronnie.  I'm controlling your show now.  Look, see, you just, that's all you have to do.  You turn off the mic and it stops.  See, it stops.  You could have done this minutes ago. 
[00:48:30]  See, I got a button over here on my side so I can just talk about anything as far as  Fezzy goes.  All right, listen, Ronnie, I tried.  Now it's up to you to turn this off.  I tried.  I tried.  Skinny sniffles.  Turned it back on.  All right, we got to take a break.  Fezzy knows I love him very much.  Oh, really?  He does know that.  Boy.  I, I, I, I would, I wouldn't do anything to upset him.  I, I'm calling out Jay Moore as a bully and, and, you know, that's where I'll leave it. 
[00:49:00]  I would just, it, nothing I said is anything that hasn't been brought out on the air and  discussed.  I wasn't making light of it.  I find it tragic.  He should be hugged.  Fezzy probably likes to be hugged a lot.  I bet.  Fezzy probably likes the type of hugs.  The problem is who, who's hugging him?  He probably likes the hugs where his arms are straight down.  Like, you know, you hug somebody and they're so sad they don't even hug you back.  Yeah, they can't even hug back.  It's just this straight arm down.  Their arms are just kind of straight down and you're hugging around their arms.  And you feel a little sigh.  Fatty pneumonia is horrible.  I never heard, I've never heard that before. 
[00:49:30]  The song's fantastic, by the way.  It's a good song.  Yeah.  Do we have that song?  I don't know.  I'm sure they do.  We could go to break with that song.  Fatty pneumonia.  We'll go to break with that.  Yeah.  Ron and Fez, Nune to Tree.  Yes.  Nune to Tree.  Think someone abused him?  Nune to Tree.  I don't know.  That's up to them to discuss.  For family to be comfortable with nudity like that is not healthy.  Right.  Well, that's what I think.  But I'm not making any, I'm not the therapist.  I'm not making any, I don't know.  I'll sit down with him.  Yeah.  Let's play the song. 
[00:50:00]  People want to hear the intern Dave getting kicked out again.  Yeah.  We'll do it after the break.  We'll give you one more play at that because we're saying it's amazing.  And this is the story, so if you want to catch up, Jim, on Fatty pneumonia.  Okay.  Ronnie wouldn't still be playing this tape, would he?  He's not that sick, is he?  I hope not.  He went to break by now, right?  For Fez's sake.  He wouldn't actually keep this going as we play now the song.  I guarantee you, you will not hear this on the Ron and Fez show.  No, no.  By this time, it's over.  Because Ronnie does care about Fez enough to stop this tape. 
[00:50:30]  Absolutely.  There's no way we're still on the Ron and Fez show with this.  Does he get sad when people still call him Fatty pneumonia?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  The chubby thing, too.  You don't know what he's going to be sensitive about on any given day.  Like, some days it's fine to talk about something.  Other days, not so much.  So he was probably a chubby kid and he was probably teased a lot.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  That's been brought up on the show.  So I think that's fair, you know, an assessment of what did happen back in.  He's passed.  Fatty pneumonia! 
[00:51:00]  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia never left the house 
[00:51:30]  All the neighborhood kids used to scream and shout  Hey, look at Batty staring out the window again  Batty always had food, but he never had friends  Mama never let him out 
[00:52:00]  He was always too sick to go out and play  One day, Fatty made love to a cupcake  One day, Fatty made love to a cupcake  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty made love to a cupcake  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty pneumonia  Fatty made love to a cupcake  Fatty pneumonia 
[00:52:30]  Fatty made love to a cupcake  Fatty pneumonia </pre>
