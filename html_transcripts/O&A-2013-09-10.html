<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie recounting a disastrous weekend at his beach house with E-Rock and Roland, two self-proclaimed "foodies" who mercilessly criticized his overcooked steak.  Roland, particularly, lambasted Opie's cooking techniques, focusing on the barbecue sauce, excessive flipping, and the steak's overall toughness.  Roland also highlighted his prolific napping, a water balloon war with Opie's son, and his refusal to participate in a planned video shoot. E-Rock, however, mainly praised the beer selection. This transitioned into a discussion of George Zimmerman's domestic dispute and the subsequent media coverage of the 911 call made by his wife.  The conversation then turned to the often unfair financial realities of divorce, specifically concerning alimony and life insurance, with several callers sharing their harrowing experiences.  The segment concluded with a preview of the upcoming CeeLo Green interview and some lighthearted confusion over the makeup of Gnarls Barkley.

The show continued with more caller accounts of acrimonious divorces, including one man's loss of his home and reliance on food stamps.  The hosts further discussed the challenges of divorce, especially with children, offering anecdotes about tense custody exchanges.  Another listener shared a story of a friend whose ex-wife cheated, became pregnant, and then demanded child support and alimony. The conversation then shifted back to the upcoming CeeLo Green interview, initially mistaken for a fiction book promotion before being corrected to an autobiography.  The hosts then discussed Jimmy Kimmel's successful prank video, followed by crude jokes about CeeLo Green's sex life.  The next guest, Kirk Fox, and his new show, "The Test" (a lie detector show), were introduced, sparking a critique of various talk shows, including those hosted by Bethenny Frankel, Kris Jenner, and Arsenio Hall (whose show was criticized for being unfunny and relying on outdated material, including a Paula Abdul prosthetic butt). The hosts also debated the relevance of Arsenio Hall and Chris Tucker, and discussed the declining success of singing competition shows in producing lasting stars, contrasting *American Idol* with *The Voice*.  The upcoming interviews with Joe DeRosa and CeeLo Green were mentioned, alongside the radio station's transitional period, characterized by a hands-off approach from previous management and a not-yet-involved new boss, resulting in canceled staff meetings and the departure of staff member Gary.  The hosts compared their situation to various stages of Aerosmith's career, referencing different albums and producers.  This led to a discussion of Aerosmith songs, a parody song ("Bambi's Got a Gun"), and the hostsâ€™ early musical tastes, including a sexually suggestive song ("Funky Cold Medina") and discussions of their first albums and The Cure (including homophobic slurs).  A digression followed about one host's son yelling "What does the monkey say?" out of a car window, leading to a discussion of potential misinterpretations. The conversation then returned to Molly Hatchet and Miley Cyrus's "Wrecking Ball" video, with explicit comments about her nudity.  The hosts expressed their desire to discuss the video with the female hosts of the "Morning Mash-up" show, using sexually suggestive and objectifying language.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Katy Perry's "It's Me, It's You", Lady Gaga's *Good Morning America* performance, and speculation about Gaga's creative choices stemming from a missed acting opportunity.  The segment ended with a mistaken identification of a Sirius XM employee for CeeLo Green and a discussion of the "Morning Mash-up" hosts' trip to San Francisco to meet Guy Fieri.

The show continued with a discussion comparing the nudity of pop stars from different eras, focusing on the difference between artists like Debbie Harry and Pat Benatar and contemporary artists like Lady Gaga.  The hosts engaged in crude and sexually explicit commentary regarding Lady Gaga's appearance and the motivations behind female artists' nudity.  They discussed various 80s female musicians and their aging appearances.  Comedian Joe DeRosa then joined the studio.  Before his arrival, the hosts discussed Anthony Weiner's political career and sexting scandals, referencing a Jimmy Kimmel segment.  They also mentioned an upcoming "Jocktober" segment and their radio careers.  DeRosa discussed driving in New York City, criticizing Mayor Bloomberg's policies, and speculated about Bill de Blasio's potential mayorship.  The conversation returned to Anthony Weiner, featuring a contentious interview segment between Weiner and Lawrence O'Donnell.  The hosts offered commentary on Weiner's actions and O'Donnell's interviewing style.  CeeLo Green was again mentioned as an upcoming guest, and other upcoming segments were briefly discussed.


The next segment focused on the cancellation of the CeeLo Green interview due to scheduling conflicts with Howard Stern, with the hosts expressing displeasure using highly offensive language.  The show then praised their new intern, Nikki, for her work ethic.  The hosts continued venting their frustrations toward various celebrities and television shows, including *The Voice*, Nick Cannon (referred to with offensive terms), and McElmore (misidentified as McElroy).  Kirk Fox, the comedian, then joined the show to promote "The Test,"  discussing physical altercations during filming and its unexpected popularity.  Fox's car (a 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid) was compared to Sean Penn's car.  His past as a nationally ranked tennis player and his transition to Hollywood were also discussed, including an anecdote about throwing the first pitch at a baseball game.  The interview continued with further discussion of "The Test" and Fox's experiences, filled with offensive language and comedic tangents.


The final segment featured a studio conversation with Joe DeRosa, beginning with effusive praise and sexually charged humor between Opie and Kirk Fox (who wasn't present).  This quickly devolved into a heated exchange between Opie and DeRosa, involving accusations of betrayal, insults ("eat me," "blow me," "suck my dick," and repeated uses of "fuck"), and a recounting of a perceived slight from DeRosa during a past show. After a commercial for Mama Mancini's meatballs and sauce, the conflict continued, with DeRosa expressing hurt feelings over Opie's perceived favoritism towards Kirk Fox. This led to discussions about Fox's appearance and Opie's alleged jealousy. DeRosa unexpectedly stated his desire to "suck a girl's dick".  The conversation shifted to DeRosa's child starting preschool and a teacher's intrusive home visit, leading to a rant about the school system and the high cost of preschool in Manhattan.  This transitioned into a contentious debate about cooking steak, filled with insults and accusations of poor cooking skills.  The discussion concluded with another heated exchange, followed by a discussion of DeRosa's recent DNA test results revealing East African ancestry, impacting his perspective on his assumed Italian and Egyptian heritage.  The show ended with further banter, including a discussion about a previous guest's cancellation and the show's new boss.  The segment was filled with profanity and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive.  Yes, they're entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Being from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio.  So shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little.  What?  He did dang open hand.  Don't listen to dang open.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, god damn it.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes.  Good morning, everyone. 
[00:01:00]  Enough plava.  As Larry King calls it, plava.  I heard the food pigs didn't like my steak.  Whoa.  No.  Your steak took a beating.  Oh, real brave when I'm not here.  Oh, gee.  I learned it from you, sir.  Bring in the food pigs.  Yeah, so that's what I heard yesterday.  Wow.  They were trashing the old steak-a-roonie.  Were they?  Yeah.  Good for them. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Man, I'm sorry I didn't infuse it with anything.  Infuse it.  You fucking fat slobs.  How about next time you wait until I'm back?  Oh, no.  I didn't infuse it with blue cheese and put whipped cream on top and a little balsamic glaze.  And then deep fry it.  Yeah, that was pretty much the... 
[00:02:00]  You fucking food pigs.  Wow.  I think Roland's big gripes were...  How are we going to get my fat intake?  He put barbecue sauce on a barbecue.  He didn't like that you flipped it more than once.  You mean Roland who falls asleep literally as you're talking to him ten times a day? 
[00:02:30]  He's going to fucking make fun of my fucking steak?  Holy shit.  You food slobs.  Go fucking eat somewhere else.  Wow.  Then he said it was overdone.  He said it was...  Yeah, I did overcook the steak.  That's for sure.  I only learned how to use a barbecue this summer, so give me a fucking break. 
[00:03:00]  Good morning, everybody.  Hey.  Look, I'll take anyone on, but don't fucking do it behind my back, you pussies.  You food pigs.  Holy shit.  You couldn't wait a day.  And then what?  Then they had a problem because I went to bed at 11?  First of all, when you have a beach house, if you make it to 10 o'clock, that's amazing.  And fucking Roland was falling asleep on the couch, falling asleep at the fire, falling asleep as he's eating the steak, falling asleep as he's falling asleep. 
[00:03:30]  He takes naps, I guess, right?  Is that it?  But these guys are going to make fun of me?  Are you kidding me?  Let me tell you something about being a parent.  When your kids go down, it's called going down, that means you get yourself to fuck to bed.  Because you're on the fucking clock.  Oh, boy.  I went to bed at 11.  Yeah, I was up at 545. 
[00:04:00]  Did you want to join me at 545 when the kids start waking up?  You're out coming.  Oh, no, it was a one-sided conversation.  Oh, yeah.  He had his fun yesterday.  Oh, damn.  The funny part, I got really nice text messages from both these guys.  Yeah.  And then I, you know, I got my guys.  They're like, oh, they're trashing your steak.  Uh-oh.  They're trashing your steak. 
[00:04:30]  E-Rock?  I will say it was more Roland than E-Rock.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Roland was really, because you know what a foodie Roland is.  Roland had a big problem with you putting barbecue sauce on the steak and cooking it on the grill.  Most of the food stuff was Roland.  Yeah, Roland.  Oh, what was your gripe?  I don't know.  I don't really had one.  Oh.  I don't know.  The store was going nowhere, so we had to bring up the steak thing.  Anthony goes, wow, you had a riveting weekend.  I go, wow, what a weekend.  So we were kind of just shredding water, and I thought, oh, yeah, guess what? 
[00:05:00]  We had steak.  And then Roland went off.  E-Rock had kudos for your beers, for the beers that you had there.  Well.  What brand was that?  Well, of course, E-Rock brings a beer and goes, this one tastes just like Fruity Pebbles.  And it was awesome.  Thank you.  Of course.  I'm not saying it was shitty, but the point is, of course.  It actually did taste a little like Fruity Pebbles, so I appreciated that. 
[00:05:30]  It was very good.  And then a little Blue Point, a little blueberry beer.  That was mine, though.  But if you heard...  It was a Fruity Beer Weekend.  Nothing wrong with that.  And then Sunday comes along, and they just take off at like 10, 30 in the morning.  I'm like, I bet you, because these fucking food slobs need to go eat a fucking buffet somewhere.  I think, yeah, fucking Rollins was saying he was hungry.  Yes, but we didn't stop for food, one.  Two, Rollins, again, head back, choking, because he can't breathe while he's sleeping in the car. 
[00:06:00]  And three, we were sitting in traffic before we even got near flushing on the LIE, just because of...  The Jets game, probably, right?  And the U.S. Open had something going on.  Like, there was just so much.  The U.S. Open had something going on.  It's called the U.S. Open.  Fair enough.  My point is really simple. 
[00:06:30]  It's like, you know, I know we all had a good time, and then I listened to the radio show.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Who is this horrible person that threw a horrible barbecue?  We all had a good time.  Like, this show's not even based on reality anymore.  I think it was Roland and the steak.  That was the biggest part of it.  I've seen it up all the times Roland fell asleep, and then falling into holes that he was digging with your son on the beach.  Right, yeah.  Roland was very cool to my son. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  They had a good time.  They had a great time.  He's throwing water balloons at him.  Yeah, because they're the same mental capacity.  Roland doesn't know fair play.  No, no, he doesn't.  If he could get one over on an infant or a child.  Poor little kid has a little pump, like a two-inch water balloon.  Roland goes, no, I'm going to go and get the hose.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then arc it.  So it has more velocity as it tags the kid on the beach.  Well, he was throwing the water balloons right at my kid's feet.  But the problem is he's a foot and a half off the ground, so all the sand there comes splashing up. 
[00:07:30]  He's getting some splatters.  I didn't mind, actually.  I like that, you know, he's getting a little tougher.  Oh, God.  Oh, I wish Roland was here now.  Oh, boy.  He's not going to like being on the receiving end.  No, that's too bad.  But, you know, hey, he had fun taking the shots yesterday.  Oh, boy.  I will tell you this.  When you got two foodies at your house and you turn on that barbecue,  dude, you're in panic mode. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, panic.  You're in panic mode.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I decided to soak the steaks.  Nice cuts of steak, by the way.  Probably too boring for these guys.  A little filet.  Oh.  You know, less fat content.  Oh, my God.  And you put them in a bowl with some barbecue sauce because it was supposed to be a quick barbecue.  Uh-huh.  Sweet Baby Jane's or whatever the fuck that barbecue sauce is called.  And apparently, uh, Roland says, uh, no, that is not what you do. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, when I go over to Roland's house and he cooks.  Oh, that's right.  Oh.  He only takes, takes, takes.  I haven't seen him fucking cook for me yet.  Wow.  Although he does bring food in here, so I guess that's not fair.  Uh.  What?  I think he's doing something for you involving food.  Why?  To kind of help you along for, so this situation doesn't happen again.  I don't need help.  I try to eat healthy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:09:00]  What's wrong with barbecue chicken and a little barbecue steak?  Nothing.  Yeah.  Well, according to Roland, there's a problem.  When I cut into that steak and realized I, like, uh, I went, it wasn't medium rare, I'm like, fuck.  Oh, boy.  But I was the one that pointed it out to these guys.  They probably wouldn't even known.  Well, I did say Roland put everything possible that you had on top of the steak.  What do you mean?  Just because it was there on the table.  So it was blue cheese, it was horseradish.  That's what I'm saying. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  It was fully covered.  A lot of condiments.  There was plenty of stuff to fucking jazz up the steak.  But I wasn't going to infuse it with anything.  He likes a good infused steak.  Of course he does.  It has a good dry rub on it.  Yes.  Some kind of.  Dry rub.  Some kind of, uh, yeah, mixed of fucking food groups.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, Roland, pretty much.  He says he doesn't like barbecue sauce on the fucking steak, because then when you put  it on the grill, it burns.  Oh. 
[00:10:00]  I had no idea until this weekend that there's a whole other process of cooking a steak that  even I wasn't aware of.  Oh, you can only flip it once.  You have to pre-cook it before you grill it and.  And then, and then you put it on the barbecue, you cook it, and then you flip it once.  What was the problem with my steak?  Oh.  Oh, Anthony was correct.  He said you don't put the barbecue sauce on it before you put it on the grill, because 
[00:10:30]  it burns it.  Right.  And, and you only flip it once.  You keep flipping, flipping, flipping.  What does it do to it if you keep flipping?  I didn't flip and, I wasn't flipping, flipping, flipping.  He said you were flipping, flipping, flipping.  It wasn't even near the barbecue.  It was me and E-Rock trying to have small talk, and we failed miserably.  Oh, no.  But we at least tried.  Like, hey.  I'm looking at the floor awkwardly.  Oh.  I'm like, grab a beer and meet me at the grill.  Oh.  Awkward.  We tried, though.  At least we tried. 
[00:11:00]  Everything else is delicious.  The steak was good.  It wasn't great.  This is what you have to deal with when you invite foodies over to your house.  Oh, trust me.  I'm an asshole when it comes to food.  Like, I tell people, it's tough with me, because I judge food very toughly.  Other than that, everything else was fantastic.  I do remember some, one of the times he was over at my house, he had a problem with some 
[00:11:30]  of the skewers.  I think they were too salty.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, oh, he's a little salty.  What the fuck is wrong with you, Roland?  Hey, I mean, free food is great, but don't give me bad food.  Free food is great, but don't give me bad free food.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, because, I mean, everything else is delicious, just the steak was a little bit  tough, my steak. 
[00:12:00]  I mean, other than that, though, everything else is good.  It didn't look like that scene out of Seinfeld where Frank Costanza over-seasoned during the  Korean War, and everybody started choking.  Right.  I over-seasoned.  I just put a little pepper on the steaks, and then threw it in some barbecue sauce, because  I didn't have anything else.  Sorry I didn't infuse your steak.  You like infused? 
[00:12:30]  What could I have infused your steak with?  Well, you threw a pepper on my steak, right?  I should have infused...  Holy fuck, yeah.  It looked like a...  We were just watching TV, they showed George Zimmerman and his wife side-by-side, and I  swear it looked like the story was George Zimmerman gets a sex change operation.  Wow, you're right.  Yeah.  That's a great bit.  Before and after.  Yeah.  I should have infused your steak with some cocaine so you could stay awake for two hours.  Oh!  Were you napping a lot? 
[00:13:00]  Well, at least some pepper on my steak.  I didn't taste any pepper.  Oh!  There was pepper on your steak.  I didn't taste any pepper.  Don't invite foodies over to your house.  There's way too much fucking pressure.  Way too much fucking pressure.  What?  That was a guttural moan.  What?  Everything else is delicious, though.  Oh.  There wasn't anything else. 
[00:13:30]  We threw together a little food.  It's the end of the season.  We don't have a lot of shit left in our house.  Actually, we've got to get out of there this weekend.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, it was a great summer.  That sucks, huh?  What we have is like smashed potatoes.  Smashed mashed.  Yeah.  Yeah, we would have had just potatoes.  Right.  We would have just fucking grilled up some potatoes.  There's a nice tomato and mozzarella salad.  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah.  Balsamic.  Yeah.  So there wasn't anything else, really. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  The side is...  Yeah.  Just another side would have been excellent, but other than that, it was perfect.  Another side would have been excellent.  We could use them.  Maybe some grilled asparagus.  Jesus.  To us, it's like, okay, you know, end of a long beach day, let's throw something together  for dinner.  I forget, for these guys, it's everything.  It's what they've been waiting for all day.  Everything else was nonsense.  The beautiful beach, the waves, the fucking beers on the beach, the fire. 
[00:14:30]  That's just distractions.  It was just distractions as they count down the time until they could bite into their infused  steak.  So we can feed.  Yes, feeding time.  Jesus.  Strap on the old feed bag.  Oh my God.  I'm done with you foodies.  I'm so done with you.  It's like background.  The beach.  Ah, it would take you out with like steak.  Did you enjoy the fire, the fire on the beach before you fell asleep?  Yeah.  It almost fell in it. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  He almost fell over on a beach chair into the fire.  This fucking animal will sleep anywhere.  He don't give a fuck.  One of Ope's neighbors came by and sat down and was talking with everybody and just in  the middle of a fishing story or something, you just hear, rolling head is like falling  off the chair and you're on the beach so everyone hears this.  Holy shit, he fell asleep right there in the middle of someone's story.  And then he, yeah, he's choking as he sleeps. 
[00:15:30]  It's the most bizarre thing to watch.  It's horrifying.  Oh, it's horrifying is right.  My body was hungry.  All right, Roland.  You won't be getting any more invites.  Oh, man.  It's too much pressure.  Can't handle it.  I'll fucking show you the way to the fucking restaurants.  Ooh.  He doesn't mind. 
[00:16:00]  Maybe next time Roland packs a cooler and he cooks for you.  Right.  There you go.  Yeah.  Do you know how to cook?  I do.  Or do you know how to just call up chefs?  I can do both.  I got lovely text messages from both these guys.  Oh.  And then I'm like, what the fuck?  What is real?  What is real?  Seriously, thank you for inviting us out.  We had a great time.  The fire was awesome. 
[00:16:30]  All right.  There you go.  Eric is not talking about the steak there, obviously.  The fire was awesome.  They just didn't like what was on top of the fire, which was the steak.  Right.  And then.  And almost Roland.  And almost Roland.  And then Roland.  Thank you again for everything.  Had a lot of fun.  Just when my allergies hit.  Because I was like, what the fuck?  Because I was trying to figure out what we could eat, you know, the next day.  And these guys took off immediately when it was a beautiful, I mean, it was a beautiful day.  You missed a beautiful day.  Just when my allergies hit, I don't eat anything.  We didn't stop for food. 
[00:17:00]  I came home to a bottle of Benadryl.  Oh, man.  What were you allergic to, Roland?  It had to be some cats or something.  That's the only thing I'm really allergic to is cats.  I guess there was previously a cat in the room, he stated.  I think you're allergic to a semi-healthy steak.  Oh.  Oh.  Bet you some of that infusion keeps the allergies away.  I love how he has to have an infused steak. 
[00:17:30]  Infused.  You just got to fancy it up, though.  Yeah.  Gussy that steak up.  Your food has to be fancied up.  Fancy it up every time.  You are a fancy guy, huh?  Well, even when I was in high school, I went to a friend's house.  I go, well, what's your side dishes?  What's your dessert?  No one's going to want you around.  It's too much.  It has to be delicious.  How about you have a healthy weekend of, you know, basic food without any of that infusion? 
[00:18:00]  He enjoys a good marinade.  Oh, does he like a good marinade?  Marinade.  Yeah, we'll put it in the marinade.  But just an over-marinade is just perfectly marinated.  In between his ten naps a day, I didn't realize that I needed a good marinade. 
[00:18:30]  Jesus, you fall asleep all the time.  It's like a shark.  Like a kitten.  Yeah.  They could just fucking...  They're gone.  If Roland stops, everything stops.  His breathing, his functioning.  And what was the viral video thing?  Oh, that you kept trying to get Roland to tape a video on the beach.  On the beach.  And then he didn't want to do it.  He just kept flat out refusing to do anything.  But we didn't even have any ideas. 
[00:19:00]  I was just fucking around.  How about this Roland sleeping on the beach?  Right.  Well, we did pull out our cameras.  Oh, did you?  Oh, yeah, we did.  Got a few shots?  Not really.  Well, I guess we got a shot of him sleeping.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I wanted the 15-second Instagram video of that guttural snore of his.  I think Eric has something on his phone.  Oh, wow.  Well, that looks like a crime scene photo.  Let me see.  He's just passed out in the sand.  Yeah, post that.  That's what I was dealing with this weekend. 
[00:19:30]  You can see right here Roland's feet as he's starting to roll towards the fire.  Oh, he's going toward the fire.  Right, right.  He's sliding down into the fire.  And then Eric was nice enough to get my son one of those giant styrofoam airplanes.  Oh, cool.  It's bigger than him.  Yeah.  And then Roland proceeded to throw it in the ocean.  And the first wave just fucking destroyed it.  Oh, no.  So we kind of had to hide that from the little one because he was very excited by the gift he got. 
[00:20:00]  And then what?  He just forgets about it?  That it would even be missed?  I hope.  So far, so good.  The wave just smashed it, huh?  Yeah.  Were you looking at it like, oh.  Oh, it's so obvious.  It's not going to survive.  Are you kidding me?  Those things don't survive if you just throw them in a park somewhere.  Yeah, they can't take a good hit with a wave.  All right, Ro.  Ro, Ro.  I'm off to the subway.  Anything else you want to get off your chest? 
[00:20:30]  No.  Was the bed okay?  Oh.  The shower?  Oh, the shower's phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Yeah.  There's one of the showers in that house where the water shoots at you from every direction.  Oh, yeah.  That was nice.  Not this one.  Did you use that one?  It hurts.  Oh, you got to keep your balls away from that shit.  Yeah, no.  It hurts.  There's one shower in that house.  Like needles?  It fucking hurts.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  What is that?  Huh?  I don't know.  All right, Ro.  We got to go.  All right.  All right.  No, not.  Fucking asshole.  He really, well, he likes his steak a certain way.  All right.  Just bring it up in front of me.  Oh, I know.  I do remember that, though, with the skewers.  It was shrimp skewers.  Right.  And he was like, okay.  He actually tells people?  Very good.  It's a, eh, shrimp skewers are a little salty. 
[00:21:30]  See, that's puzzling, because the guy you have that cooks for you at all your events  is very good.  Yeah.  All his food is amazing.  I wouldn't be able to take it.  If I had to fucking stand behind the grill and be judged.  So I just fucking get somebody.  That's it.  And Roland, baby, excuse me, sorry.  Do you have to grill the lemon with it?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Oh, man. 
[00:22:00]  Hmm.  Okay.  Yeah, but you realize, you know, when you get these guys that are really into their food.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the headline here.  Oh, yeah.  That's a lot of fucking pressure.  A lot of pressure.  And I don't fire up a barbecue often.  I live in an apartment in a city.  He's not a...  We're not allowed to have barbecues.  Yeah.  He's not one of those guys that like, you know, ah, just give me anything.  I'll just shove it down my throat.  He needs infusion. 
[00:22:30]  Well, I set him up nice, too, because I'm like, oh, fuck.  I think the steak's a little overdone.  Oh, boy.  And I'm like, fuck.  Oh, boy.  So.  He didn't like that.  No, I knew they didn't like it, because they didn't go back for seconds, those food slobs.  I think that's what he said.  I didn't go for seconds.  I was very hungry.  Because they made extra, knowing that they consume a little more than the opster.  I was still hungry. 
[00:23:00]  Hey, whoa.  Anyway.  That's something.  So what happened with George Zimmerman?  Is this all bullshit?  Oh, man.  I don't know.  His wife, future ex-wife, they're estranged.  You can understand having a problem with an ex, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, for all the shit I went through, at least, you know, all the lying and stuff  was kept in court.  There was no outside of the courtroom drama.  Right.  But I know enough people that have been through divorces where, man, shit gets, you know, 
[00:23:30]  twisted around, used for future courtroom hijinks and stuff like that.  So I guess he was over at her house, and her father was there.  So he comes up, and there was a problem, some kind of problem, and she called 911.  And the cops, and of course the news covers it as, there's a domestic dispute involving  a gun with George Zimmerman. 
[00:24:00]  And then, ah, and then when you find out all the facts, the cops never even saw a gun.  She was way overdramatic on the 911 call.  Oh, Dad, walk away, he could start shooting us.  It's like, what?  Wait, wait, what?  What?  Yeah, yeah, she really, is she a little crazy?  She really poured it on.  Is she a bit psychotic?  I think she's a little crazy.  Yeah.  Look, look, I'm not fucking sitting here, and I'm going to be Mr. Rah-Rah for George 
[00:24:30]  Zimmerman's personal life.  For the trial, it was one thing.  You know, he could be the biggest asshole in the world.  I never met him.  I don't know.  But.  Yeah, because they were going after you on Twitter yesterday.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Hey, hey, your boy.  Your boy right there.  What about your boy, George?  I read a few of them.  Hey, hey, your boy.  Hey, look what your boy did.  I'm like, I.  But then I love your supporters are like, well, here they come.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm sure they came.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, this is the guy you were supporting? 
[00:25:00]  Exactly.  Idiots.  Exactly.  They're all idiots.  Oh, God.  Oh, look at your boy.  Oh, this is the guy you're backing, huh?  Hey, I guess you know.  It's two different things.  It's just.  Like you just said, he could be the biggest asshole ever.  We have no idea.  I don't know.  But you had, you know, a lot of passion behind that case, and you felt like the guy was being  done wrong.  For that particular event. 
[00:25:30]  For that case.  Right.  Hey.  Yeah.  What is he doing?  Stand at his ground with his wife?  So, yeah.  The best one was, what, did she bring Skittles into the house?  Right?  You know?  Anyone?  Where's my retweets?  This is a good one.  She brings Skittles.  Yeah.  I read those. 
[00:26:00]  Did you?  I read those.  Really?  Maybe a few?  Maybe a few times.  You know?  Skittles?  And between getting pictures of the guy that made the giant fucking pistol mailbox.  Oh.  And the pistol pool and all that shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the pistol barbecue.  Pistol barbecue.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I don't know.  I'm not there.  But the police, and they said he's in custody, which people don't know the difference between  you're under arrest and he's in custody. 
[00:26:30]  If he's in custody, it means he's being held where he is and being questioned.  So they can figure some shit out.  Yeah.  They're telling him, right now, you can't leave until we figure all this out.  Right.  But you're not under arrest.  Right.  So they questioned him and questioned her and the father and his bodyguard who was there  and came to the conclusion that there wasn't any reason to arrest anybody.  She decided not to press any charges.  And that was it. 
[00:27:00]  And the cops, in a statement, said we never saw a gun.  There was never a gun on him or on scene that we know of.  Later on, he said that there was a gun in his vehicle.  Right.  But that he hadn't taken it into the house when he talked with his wife and her father.  She claims he punched the father in the nose or something and smashed her iPad because  she was trying to video with it, I guess.  And she said he smashed it. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  Which you would do in that circumstance.  Yeah, right.  Like, why the fuck are you filming me?  Yeah.  I think she's gearing up for getting some divorce ammo.  But he has no money.  Well, where the fuck is she going to find money from?  He could write a book.  He could do things like that.  Yeah.  You know, she's just looking for something, some ammo to fuck him over in a divorce case.  But, you know, so who knows what both sides are.  Like I said, though, he could be the biggest asshole and, you know, I don't know. 
[00:28:00]  But the bottom line is, ah, he's illegal.  Now, they're going through a separation.  They're heading toward a divorce, but they're still in the same house?  I think he was moving shit out.  Oh, so it was happening there.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that old gag.  He's got to hit the road.  You get a few in.  Yeah, yeah.  As you're carrying a box out of the house.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And I'm sure she's like, you know, don't take that.  Right.  He's like, you fucking fuck.  He's coming over, Dad. 
[00:28:30]  Come over here so he doesn't do anything.  And the father's there, and I'm sure.  There's a recipe for disaster.  Yes, exactly.  But it's not a house of horrors, right?  Not a house of horrors.  But a recipe for disaster?  Recipe for disaster.  All right.  Perfect storm.  Perfect storm.  Okay.  You know, any of the other news cliches you can whip up.  Let's do a little 911 action.  So this is her call, 911?  Yeah, yeah.  911, do you need police, fire, or medical?  This is some of the police.  All right. 
[00:29:00]  We do have Muniton route to you, ma'am.  Is he still there?  Yes, he is.  And he's trying to shut the garage door on me.  Is he inside now?  No, he's in his car.  And he continually has his hand on his gun.  And he keeps saying, step closer.  He's just threatening all of us.  Step closer.  With his fire on.  With his fire on.  See, right there.  Right there.  I kind of believe that he's in his car, though.  Kind of like, you know.  He's very dangerous in that car. 
[00:29:30]  But he's still, you know, legal.  He's staying in the car this time.  He he he.  But just the fact that she brings up the gun very quickly, you know.  Right.  He's threatening us with his firearm.  You know, it's George Zimmerman.  Look out.  I always thought he was irresponsible.  Yeah.  I just had to keep my mouth shut during the whole court thing.  She said in a recent statement that they've been married seven years and she just doesn't  even know who he is.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is this is just divorce shit. 
[00:30:00]  You can't believe either side when you're talking divorce shit.  So who the fuck knows?  I believe he was in his car and I believe he was probably saying exactly this.  Yeah.  Come on.  Right.  But knowing he's, you know, he's still legal right there.  Yeah.  He's going to shoot us.  Okay.  He punched my dad in the nose.  My dad has a mark on his face.  I saw his glasses were on the floor.  He, he had accosted my father and then took my iPad out of my hand and smashed it and cut 
[00:30:30]  it with a pocket knife.  Cut it with a pocket knife?  What?  So, but they didn't arrest him, right?  No, no, no.  She didn't press any charges.  And I assume if there's evidence of domestic abuse and violence, it doesn't matter if she  pressed charges or not.  They arrest the guy.  Right, right.  But in this case, I guess she was just like, oh, well, no. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, my God.  Dad, dad, get behind a car or something.  I don't know if he's going to start shooting at us.  Are you going to get outside right now?  See, that's way.  What did she say there?  That's way over the top.  I don't know if he, he's shooting at us or not.  Get behind the car.  I don't know if he's going to.  Oh, going to?  Yeah.  All right.  Start shooting.  At that point, the cops are there.  They're trying to get him out of the car.  I guess they're talking to him and they have their guns out because of, you know, her 911  call is saying, hey, he's got a gun.  He's threatening with a gun. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  So she's probably hoping the cops just light him up.  Right.  At that point.  Wow.  Are you guys outside right now?  Yes, we are.  And the police have their weapon trust.  Dad, get inside the house.  George might start shooting at us.  I don't know.  We're going inside the house.  George might start shooting at us.  Okay.  Go back inside.  Oh, my God.  Are you guys both inside now?  Okay.  Stay in there, okay? 
[00:32:00]  Let the police take care of it.  Okay.  He's got his hands in the air.  He's not touching his weapon.  Okay.  I don't, you know.  She has to bring up, she's bringing up that weapon a lot.  I don't like her.  He didn't have it on him, by the way.  Right.  What was it?  Was it in his glove box?  I guess it was in the, yeah, in the vehicle.  Now, whether he had it on him beforehand, I don't fucking know either.  The people actually used to put their gloves in the...  In the glove box.  In the glove box.  They're driving gloves. 
[00:32:30]  Put it in the glove box.  In the glove compartment.  Can't we just change the name of that shit?  No one wears gloves.  I don't like her.  No, she, uh...  I mean, this is your thing, really, but...  Nah.  I just don't like her.  This is just a bad divorce situation.  She brings up the gun much too much.  I think she's posturing to have...  She knew, she knows, that this 911 tape will be played in court during some divorce proceeding.  Right. 
[00:33:00]  And the more her lawyer can say, listen to the fear in her voice.  She's afraid of that firearm.  This man's a monster.  And then it just gives you more negotiating power for the settlement.  When you're like, you know, does he want to go through all this?  And then he's got to settle.  It's, uh...  It's way over the top dramatic for what apparently happened based on what the police said.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  You guys are safe inside, correct?  Yes.  Wow, what is she...  Oh, my God.  Now what?  Cops are there.  Everything...  The situation is under control.  What is she doing?  I don't know.  Shelly, you're doing really good, okay?  Oh, yeah.  This is a tough situation for anyone. 
[00:34:00]  All right?  Let's stay on the line with you, all right?  So our unit can speak with you, all right?  All right?  Okay.  Oh, and she's fat.  All right.  Are you okay?  You said he did take something out of your hand.  Do you need medical as well?  Um, I don't think so.  Maybe just shock.  Okay.  Shock.  All right.  I'm going to go ahead and get FD to respond, okay?  Okay.  Dad, get inside right now.  Make sure he stays inside.  What happened?  She stopped crying, like, in a second? 
[00:34:30]  She's one of those emotional...  She's like, Dad, get inside right now.  She's one of those emotional wrecks.  Yuck.  Pretty funny.  George Zimmerman walked away from that trial with a complete acquittal.  Right.  And no problems.  She walks away with a fucking, like, perjury charge or some fucking shit that she's still  got to deal with.  Right.  So she's the one that gets fucked.  Hey, I have a hard time sympathizing with women's sides of divorce cases. 
[00:35:00]  I'm definitely biased on that one, so fuck her in her ass.  So does the media have any responsibility here because...  And then you've got to hear, you're part of me.  Oh, God, I love that one.  Yeah, but we try to do things a little different here.  Yeah, no one's going to us for fucking, you know, the bottom line.  I hope you understand that.  We try to do things a little different here.  We don't just blindly go with, like, the headline. 
[00:35:30]  They went with the headline.  But that's why they have no responsibility here because I, when I heard this broke, of  course, I went to Twitter like anyone else, and they had them all arrested.  Yeah, it's like, George Zimmerman arrested.  Here's what the news was saying.  George Zimmerman arrested and a gun is involved again.  Right.  Oh, a gun charge.  And then Nancy Grace, she was writing, George Zimmerman arrested on a gun charge.  Right.  I was like, well, that's completely wrong. 
[00:36:00]  I'm not even supporting the guy or not supporting the guy.  Just getting the facts right.  You've got to at least get the facts right and then throw your two cents in.  Holy shit.  Right.  She's just despicable with her new hashtags.  Trash baby, toilet baby, fucking missing fucking teen mom thing.  Yeah.  She loves a good fucking hashtag.  Bob in L.A.  Hey, Bob, what do you got?  Is it L.A. or Louisiana? 
[00:36:30]  Louisiana.  Hey, a couple things here.  Now, from what the news is, and of course it was CNN, so, you know, take it for what  it's worth, but they, he was going, he was at the house that they used to own, and she  came over to get her stuff.  There was supposed to be a civil standby, which is why he had his pistol there.  But anyway, besides that, you guys know about the whole insurance policy thing.  A life insurance policy as part of a divorce decree?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's pretty common, though.  Why is that common? 
[00:37:00]  I had one of those.  What is that, Ant?  Well, in my case, I had to take out a $1 million life insurance policy on myself and put her  as the beneficiary, my ex-wife there, and put her, so if anything happened to me, she  would get a million bucks.  Is it over, though?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, because it went down, it went down like $100,000 a year for 10 years  until it was nothing for her. 
[00:37:30]  But if that isn't...  Wait, that's a 10-year policy?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not just when you're going through the divorce?  No.  So she could have still made money off you after you're officially divorced?  Yeah, if something happened to me five years after, she would have made $500,000.  And this is legal?  If that isn't, by the way, an incentive for murder...  Of course!  If all of a sudden she's in a jam and she's like, oh, well, I got this, or she gets some  boyfriend that's like, hey, man, why don't we fucking kill him? 
[00:38:00]  And it's fucking...  She fucking...  It's an absolute incentive to kill somebody.  She fucking hates you at that point.  Right.  And, of course, the hate is mutual.  Yes.  Let's acknowledge that.  Yes.  But now there's an incentive because there's money involved.  And, again, not even just her, but what if she does tie up with some guy, and what if  the guy doesn't even say anything about it?  It's like, he knows about the insurance, and he doesn't tell her.  They don't plot together, but he's like, hey, if I kill this dude, she gets the million  bucks, and I get to share in it. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, fuck, I'm just going to kill this fucking guy.  It's of reason to kill...  You're making...  You're giving someone a motive to kill somebody.  Lawyers, they're scumbag fuck dicks.  We should be allowed to pinch Heiney still.  Oh, should we ever?  Because it's one-sided.  It's one-sided in the whole divorce thing.  We all know it.  And then, of course, you'll get one woman to call and go, well, actually, I got fucked  in the divorce.  Okay, but you're in the minority big time. 
[00:39:00]  There's one.  Yeah, exactly.  Who put that through the court system?  Yeah.  But you have to get a life insurance policy.  It's amazing to me.  And they just do it.  And the beneficiary is the person you fucking hate, and you want to be separated from.  Yeah.  That don't make no sense.  No.  It gives them motive for murder.  I think I remember you telling me about that.  I forgot.  Oh, it was fucking...  That terrified me more than anything, I might say, on the air, that people disagree with 
[00:39:30]  and stuff.  That right there was the thing that I feared most, was that some fucker is going to think  there's a payday in, you know, a family member of hers, anything.  There's a number of people that didn't like me, and now it gives them a great motive to  fucking off me, so she gets fucking rich.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But women want equality. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, equality.  You can't have it both ways.  Yeah, until it goes that way, then they don't want the equality.  And then the poor fucking...  I think the glass ceiling broads should get together and go, okay, look, you know, this  isn't fair.  Yeah.  You know, we want equality, but look, you know...  Yeah, yeah.  We get the better half of any divorce out there.  Yeah, you do.  Yeah, we know that.  Fucking bitches.  We all know that.  We've done hours on this.  Yeah.  Hours and hours and hours on this fucking shit. 
[00:40:30]  Just watch Basketball Wives.  Oh, God.  Sam knows.  I'm obsessed with the show, because they're a bunch of twats, and they're all living in  incredible mansions that they had nothing to do with in the end.  Yeah.  I'm all for taking care of somebody after, you know, the marriage goes bad, but not to  the extent where these women are living in sick palaces, and then you see who they were  married to, and you're like, oh, okay.  They had nothing to do with the money. 
[00:41:00]  No.  That was coming in.  That's why I'm fucking...  Oh, here we go.  Listen to this guy, John in Ohio.  What's up, John?  Hey, I got divorced when my daughter was two years old, and I had to carry a $3 million life  insurance policy until she turned 18.  And then after 18, I had to, you know, if she went to college, I still had to carry a policy  for when she was in college.  But once she was... 
[00:41:30]  I'm trying to think of the name.  Well, I...  I got to jump in on this one a little bit, because now we're talking about a kid, which is half  yours, obviously.  So it makes it a little, like, more tricky, I think.  Yeah, it does.  I mean, what Ed's talking about here is, like, he was married to somebody, they didn't even  own a house to get...  They didn't even own a car, really.  Nothing.  I had a leased vehicle.  He had a leased vehicle.  He was renting.  No kids.  No kids in sight.  No real assets.  And he had to get this life insurance policy. 
[00:42:00]  I almost could see it a little bit if you got kids in the mix.  Maybe not to the point that it's $3 million.  Holy shit, but...  I mean, yeah, and try to pay a $3 million policy on, you know, a $60,000 a year salary.  Wow.  Alex Trebek couldn't help.  Yeah.  Term life.  $1,100 in child support.  So how'd you live?  With beans and soup.  You did, right?  Oh, that's amazing. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  I mean, you know, you do what you got to do, but I mean, like he said, you know, you got  to do all that crap for the woman.  And don't get me wrong, you know, it's no big deal, but now, but I mean, back then,  it was, you know, you had the strength to do it.  Wow.  That's sadder than the divorced dad in his apartment.  Right.  As the fucking mother has the house and all the furniture.  I go back to a guy that we worked with at N.E.W., a sales guy who was doing very, very well, 
[00:43:00]  had a really nice house up there in Westchester somewhere, big, huge spread, just picture one  of those perfect houses with the trees and all that shit, big backyard.  And when we knew him, he was in a shitty, tiny little apartment in New York City because  he was going through a divorce.  And he, he told us to our face, he can't afford to live better than a shitty one, one room  apartment in New York City and a shitty neighborhood too, by the way. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  And I was like, you got to be kidding.  You're the one going to work every day, bringing in a lot of fucking money.  It's just, uh, how is that fair?  It's so sad.  I don't want the woman to suffer like that either, but it seems like somewhere in between  makes a lot more sense.  The tiny little apartment, the fucking, uh, it's terrible.  Well, here you go.  This is your nightmare right here.  Eric in Colorado, who I think makes up stuff for the show.  Eric, what's up? 
[00:44:00]  Hey, about 20 years ago, a guy I went to high school with, his older brother.  He was murdered three years after his divorce was final.  Oh.  He was carrying a life insurance policy.  It was like 500,000.  It wasn't, you know, a million dollar policy.  500,000.  People have killed for a lot less.  That's a lot of money.  Well, yeah.  And the, I remember the investigation, everybody that was basically either first or second hand  knowledge of this guy was investigated by the cops as to whether or not they were involved. 
[00:44:30]  And they watched his ex-wife financially for 10 years.  And they watched it afterwards, make sure she didn't suddenly come into money.  Right, right.  There was so much, or, you know, I mean, she, she got the money, but they were watching  everybody involved to make sure that.  Yeah, see if she was paying anybody or whatever the fuck else was going on.  Right.  It does astound me, though, because they literally are putting people's lives in danger with some  of these policies.  You know, it's the same thing with not issuing restraining orders against some violent guys 
[00:45:00]  when they go and they beat the shit out of their wife or kill their estranged wives and  things like that.  But they, they just make these circumstances, these lawyers make these circumstances that  lead to somebody's death and murder.  It's amazing.  Hmm.  Fuck wads.  And she, and your, your ex was going to get money no matter what.  So what?  Yeah, yeah.  But why the insurance policy on top of it? 
[00:45:30]  Well, because if I stopped earning, because I wasn't around anymore, uh, you know, she  would have been out of luck.  Can we get the clip of, uh, I'm not a big fan of O'Donnell on MSNBC, but he basically  asked Wiener, what the fuck is wrong with you?  Oh, why?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can we get that clip?  Yeah, that's a good one.  After the break?  Even, even, even, even crazier, even crazier, and this didn't go through, even the judge  didn't go for this one.  Right.  Was the fact that if she had died, I would still have had to pay, uh, for nine years 
[00:46:00]  to her estate.  To whom?  Exactly.  It would have gone to.  She doesn't have, she didn't have anyone.  Whatever her will would have said.  Her cats?  It would have gone to her mom, or her brother, or another family member, or, or some fucking  dopey boyfriend, maybe, that she wanted money to go to.  I still would have had to pay, but even the judge fucking threw that one out.  You probably said enough, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Could you imagine if I fucking, she fucking dies, and I'm still paying some dude? 
[00:46:30]  Just say some freeloader.  Yeah, yeah.  Could you imagine that?  I've had some strangers calling you, where's my check?  Anthony, where's my check?  And this is, and this is, and this is like fucking, like, seven years later.  Right.  Anthony, fucking check's late, man.  Send that check.  Remember, yeah, I was the guy that was fucking, uh, your wife after, after you.  So, I need millions of dollars.  So, keep sending those checks. 
[00:47:00]  Could you fucking imagine?  Life's just fucked up.  They make you want to fucking kill people.  Unbelievable.  This guy went to jail because of his divorce.  Uh, Phil.  That happens, too, yeah.  In Pennsylvania.  What's up, Phil?  Uh, Phil.  Yeah, I said Phil.  Uh, not Phil.  Phil.  B-I-L-L-L.  Oh, Bill.  I'm sorry, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  Anthony, I went to jail because I went through that insurance, and she wanted alimony. 
[00:47:30]  Uh-huh.  I even told the judge, I said, you know what, I'll make off better.  I said, I'm giving her the house already.  That's all the fuck she's gonna get.  I have a trucking company.  That's all she's gonna get.  I had the trucking company before I got married.  And all that stuff.  And she wanted half of everything.  I told her I'd go to jail.  Ah.  I said, okay.  So I went to jail for three months, came back.  He said, are you ready to settle now?  I said, nope, bring me back.  I said, I get three meals a day, cable TV, and I'm going to get new clothes when I leave. 
[00:48:00]  I'm still way ahead of the game.  And you're not paying her?  I don't pay her a fucking thing.  Wow, look at that.  Are you still in jail?  No, I'm driving a truck right now.  I'm heading down to Virginia.  Well, but do they finally say, all right, fuck it?  No, she gave in.  Her and her lawyer.  Oh, they finally gave in?  Good for you.  Yeah, because she's probably still got to pay the lawyers, so she's just like, oh, boy.  Oh, we got a success story here.  Yeah, I like that.  Now I got the Anthony allergy.  Yeah.  If you go to ask about marriage, I start walking away. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, there's no way.  People know.  Thank God I have a radio show, because people know not to even fucking mention it to me.  Wow.  No, I do.  I was in there.  I met a bunch of new friends.  I even gave them a couple of new jobs working in my company.  What a guy.  Well, wasn't Jake LaMotta married a few times?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  What did he say?  Six times?  Six, was it?  Six.  And then that broad is pressuring him to get married again so she could have the Jake LaMotta  money when he drops. 
[00:49:00]  I mean, did anyone else see that?  Of course.  Oh, my God.  And he's like, I don't have time.  Yes, you do, Jake.  Jake has all the time in the world, because she described his day, and it was, get up,  read the paper, take a nap.  Yeah.  That was it.  That was his day.  Anyway, so a guy like that has time to get married, and even at 91, even though he's  not completely there, he's there when it comes to, you know, getting married again.  You heard him.  We don't have time.  When we find the time.  When we find the time.  You're fucking 91 years old. 
[00:49:30]  Right.  You have plenty of time.  He knows, though.  Yeah.  He finally learned his lesson after five or six of those.  Certainly did.  All right, Bill.  Well, thank you, sir.  All right.  Have a good day, all right?  Amazing.  We got a busy day.  Yeah, we do.  We got CeeLo Green coming in.  CeeLo?  The voice guy, right?  Yeah, and the fuck you guy.  Oh, yeah.  The fuck you guy.  Narls Barkley.  Narls Barkley.  I'm Narls Barkley. 
[00:50:00]  Is he going to come in here dressed all weird and shit?  Yes.  Goody mob.  How about you interview him?  I would love to.  All right.  You guys want to take off?  Sub it out.  Yeah.  I'll do it in an heartbeat.  Yeah.  Sub out the interview.  Just tell him we went for coffee or something.  We'll come back after it's done.  Is he going to be all feathery and shit?  I think so.  I don't know if he'll come in full regalia.  I swear to God, if he comes in looking all weird and shit, I'm going to openly laugh.  Not today. 
[00:50:30]  And I'm not even in a bad mood, but I'm not putting up with it.  That's his gimmick.  Yeah.  Gimmick.  And so my gimmick is I'm going to openly laugh at how ridiculous you look.  Ooh.  Is he talented?  He is very talented.  In one way.  He is a talented guy.  As a producer?  No.  He's actually a good singer.  Singer.  I mean.  Yeah, but he only has the Fuck You song, right?  He's got a couple singles with Narls Barkley that were huge.  Crazy.  Remember how big that song was?  Crazy.  Yeah, but was he doing the crazy part?  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  That one he was. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  All right, then.  That's him?  Yeah.  So that should be his song.  Well, you know, his buddy is a...  The guy who sings The Hulk should get the fucking credit.  It's a band, though.  No, it's not a band.  Listen to this fucking voice.  This should be by CeeLo.  The music behind it makes it Narls Barkley.  He does have a really good voice.  He's a good singer.  He's great.  Who's that?  Is that CeeLo still?  That's CeeLo, yeah.  So where's Narls Barkley's part?  He's in Narls Barkley's band.  Narls Barkley's the name of the band.  It's like Jethro Tull.  Oh. 
[00:51:30]  You know what?  I swear to you.  Until this moment, I didn't know that.  There's no Narls Barkley?  No.  No, it's CeeLo Green and Danger Mouse.  Come on now.  Oh, my God.  I feel like a fucking fool.  Yeah.  Put me on the fool list.  All right.  Are you serious?  Yes.  Jethro Tull.  Marshall Tucker.  It's a band.  Are you serious?  It's a band.  So this is CeeLo's band?  Yeah.  It's a two-person band.  Holy fuck.  I'm heating up.  Really?  Yeah.  I had no idea.  I thought there was a Narls Barkley. 
[00:52:00]  Of course not.  No.  Oh, I'm an idiot.  Maybe you mix it up with D.X. Bentley.  Right.  This is Narls Barkley.  There they are.  With the Danger Mouse dude.  That's Danger...  Yeah.  And then CeeLo Green.  He looks like a short Patrice in that picture.  He does.  What other songs did he have?  Well, of course, Fuck You.  I love doing our research on the show.  That was a big hit.  The Fuck You song.  Fuck You was a big hit.  It's huge.  Right. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Is this Forget You or Fuck You, Iraq?  See you're driving around town with the girl I love.  And I'm like, fuck you.  There you go.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  What a huge song this was.  Yeah.  Huge.  I'm like, fuck you and I fuck her too.  Say the five.  So why didn't you put this in the Narls Barkley category?  This was his solo release.  Yeah, but the other one's pretty much solo.  He's got Deadmau5 doing his beat shit.  It's Danger Mouse. 
[00:53:00]  Deadmau5 is somebody else.  Deadmau5.  Deadmau5 is somebody else.  No, it's not.  Same guy.  I'm not.  Sure, it might be.  No.  All right.  There can't be two mouse guys.  That's stupid.  Ding, ding.  You want to take one more divorce call?  Sure.  All right, so solo's coming in today.  Good song for this divorce thing, too.  Is he fun?  His songs are fun.  He's fun on the voice.  He's got a cockatoo on his shoulder half the time.  Is he going to come in with a bird on his shoulder?  I hope so.  What will you do?  Like Coco Beware.  That's right.  He looks like Coco Beware. 
[00:53:30]  Coco Beware.  If Coco Beware was a little, you know, hip-hop, a little flashy.  Dave, what's going on, buddy?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  Hey, long story short, I end up getting a divorce.  You can't start with that.  You can't start with long story short.  No, no.  Because that's like after you start telling the story and it starts getting a little long, 
[00:54:00]  you go, long story short, this happened.  Right.  That's like saying...  You start with long story short.  That's like saying I got something funny and then it's never funny.  Oh, that's terrible.  Don't set up your shit with I got something funny to say.  What?  My apologies.  Use long story short right before the end of your story.  Oh, perfect.  Yeah.  All right.  Right before the punchline.  Right.  All right.  So here it is.  We're living up in Westchester.  We sell our house.  Make a lot of money on the house.  Move to Florida.  Put all the money in on the house. 
[00:54:30]  Buy a beautiful brand new house down there.  And then, long story short, several years later, she ends up meeting somebody at work.  They get together.  Oof.  She's been cheating on me for a couple of years.  Oh, years.  We got two kids.  And at the end, I end up literally signing over the house to her.  She gets married last April.  Oh.  And I'm living in a one-bedroom apartment back in Westchester. 
[00:55:00]  Another divorce success story.  At least you're in Westchester.  Back in Westchester.  But the kicker is, I'm on food stamps to support myself.  Because she gets $1,100.  Bum.  Yep.  And I can barely survive on what I make, and I'm a teacher.  Ouch.  Wow.  Yep.  There you go.  Well, that's...  Two kids.  Two kids.  Another nightmare.  Yeah.  Two kids, and you've got to fucking deal with it. 
[00:55:30]  I know too many people that are divorced and have kids, and they still have to deal with  their fucking exes.  Amazing to me.  I had a landlord in Huntington, and all I wanted to do was just go home, and there would  be fights on the front lawn, because the one was coming to get the kids.  I'm trying to be a little vague, because I don't want to get the guy.  Right, right, right.  And the cops would be there.  They'd be yelling and screaming as I'm just pulling in. 
[00:56:00]  I just wanted to go to my house.  And it happened more than once, too.  Crying the scene.  Oh, and then you see the kids.  They're crying in the corner.  It's like...  Yeah, it's great.  You know, they can't even do it somewhere else, so the kids don't hear that their parents  hate them.  They're fucking screaming.  Hate each other, I mean, I should say.  Right.  They're blaming themselves.  Oh, boy.  And I would have to go, am I allowed to go into the driveway?  I wouldn't even know.  Jesus.  I would come home sometimes thinking the fucking house was on fire. 
[00:56:30]  There was so much shit going on outside.  There was equipment in front of the house.  There's just something to be said for not ever having to deal with your ex again.  Like, once it's over, no kids, no fucking mutual property, or just it's done, and they  are gone.  Right.  I got another good story for you.  What?  Bet you don't.  Like, my best friend was married to a girl, and she ended up cheating on him and got pregnant. 
[00:57:00]  This just happened maybe less than a year ago.  She ended up getting pregnant, turns around, and asks him for child support and alimony.  Wow.  Yeah, they can do that.  That takes balls, huh?  Yes.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  Have a great day, guys.  Yeah, you too.  There's Dave.  We're going to take a break here.  So, we got CeeLo Green coming in?  Yes.  Yeah, man.  Is The Voice kicking up again?  Yeah, but he's promoting a book. 
[00:57:30]  Okay.  The Voice is back September 23rd.  Yeah, that's right around the corner, man.  What's his book all about?  Everybody's Brother.  His book is at today.  It's a story.  I think it's a novel.  It's fiction.  Oh.  What?  What happened?  Maybe not.  Maybe it's his autobiography.  Oh, well, that's different.  Yeah, it is his autobiography.  It's fiction.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Wish I could reverse the crickets.  Well, then we'll talk about what's in it. 
[00:58:00]  You guys didn't peruse it?  No.  I'll peruse it now.  No.  Oh.  Why would we?  I like being surprised.  Jimmy's the reader.  Oh.  Jimmy's where?  In L.A. today?  Yes.  Leno.  Leno.  Nice.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Is Leno faking viral videos, too, or what?  Oh, man.  It's Kimmel.  He's killing it.  Kimmel fucking nailed it on that one.  Yeah, we'll talk about that after the break.  Uh-huh.  He's got a pink cover. 
[00:58:30]  No, the cover's shiny.  No, that part's pink.  The back cover's pink.  And that's pink.  And CeeLo's written in pink.  What's wrong with that?  It's a memoir.  It's not a memoir.  It's not a novel.  Has he, uh...  I don't know.  Has he...  Hmm...  He's fucking girls.  Or is it still mysterious?  He's banging.  He bangs broads.  He bangs broads, huh?  On the daily.  So it's still mysterious?  There's nothing mystery about it.  Huh?  He fucks chicks.  That's what you're saying.  You don't even know what I'm talking about.  You're assuming a lot there, Sam Roberts. 
[00:59:00]  Well, that's what you said.  I'm just saying, is he mysterious?  That's what you said.  I've seen him on Cribs, and he had a hot chick with him.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  Really?  CeeLo rules.  Real hot chick.  You like the CeeLo, Travis?  Oh, absolutely.  He's a man.  Yeah.  Yeah?  His records are great.  Mm-hmm.  Very talented.  Even when he's with that Gnarls Barkley guy.  Yeah.  Yes.  Not even gonna lie about that one.  I could have made believe.  I gotta tell you, for some reason, I thought there was an Gnarls Barkley. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, God.  I've been doing it a little hot.  A little bit today.  A little bit.  It's not something that is so cool.  Not as hot as my steaks, though.  Right, E-Rock?  Oh, boy.  A little too much heat on those.  A little too much for Roland.  And we got one of my new friends coming in.  And I think Ann will like him, too, man.  Kirk Fox is gonna be in here today.  Cool.  I met him in L.A. when I was doing that thing for TBS.  He's a strange dude, man.  Strange, funny, quirky dude. 
[01:00:00]  And I think he'll fit in nicely on this radio show.  And he's got a new show called, What, The Test, right?  Indeed he do.  It's like a daytime show, right?  Yeah, it kind of has that Maury Povich angle to it.  You go in with some kind of thing, some kind of thing, and then you take the test to see who's lying.  See who's full of fucking shit.  Right.  He's gonna be using lie detectors, DNA tests, pregnancy tests, and other types of definitive medical examinations to put anyone who is willing to the test. 
[01:00:30]  That's not the guy I know.  He's got glasses on.  He shaved his mustache.  Yeah.  He's been on a shitload of TV shows with that mustache of his.  But they told him, if you're doing this show, you gotta shave that mustache.  He's looking pretty straight-laced right there.  Yeah, so he'll be in a little later.  It's a great concept for a show.  Yeah.  It's just the good part of talk shows.  It's just catching people lying about stuff.  Yes.  Everyone loves catching people lying.  Dude, these talk shows.  Oh, my God. 
[01:01:00]  Everyone's doing a talk show.  Did you see the Bethany one?  I haven't seen it yet.  I've seen that it exists.  Well, she has a plastic face with big, giant golf balls as cheekbones.  Nice.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  Maybe I should go on the morning mashup and throw the ball around with the girls.  It's a girl show over there, right?  I guess, but there's only the one girl.  Yeah.  I don't want to throw it around with the girls.  Can I do a break with them?  Look at what she did to her fucking face.  Oh, my God.  She's one of those housewives.  Is she?  I have no idea who she is. 
[01:01:30]  And I think she got cheek implants or something.  Like that fucking chick that was singing in Eraserhead.  Yeah, she looks horrendous.  Crazy.  She looks horrible.  And the show's horrible.  And the Kris Jenner one is horrible.  You think they're going to use those quotes on the show?  Yeah, I hope so.  Bethany.  She's horrible.  Greg.  I hope you.  She stinks.  Yeah.  Everybody wants to be Wendy Williams.  And then you said you saw Arsenio Hall's new show.  Speaking of talk shows.  Whoa.  How is it?  Hey, I'd rather watch Seinfeld episodes that I saw a thousand times that they replaced with Arsenio. 
[01:02:00]  So that premiered last night?  Yeah, it premiered last night.  Fuck, I wish I saw it.  It was such a...  It reminded me of the first Chevy Chase show.  Really?  It was so maudlin.  And they did a little bit where he takes a fake ass out of a time capsule.  Because he's like, oh, let's open up the Arsenio time capsule.  He went through these 90 things.  Like, I have my cell phone and all. 
[01:02:30]  And then he pulls out an ass and goes, this is Paul Abdul's ass from one of our videos.  And then Paul Abdul comes out from behind the curtain.  He makes a face like, oh!  Really?  There it is.  That's the bit.  We found it.  We found the bit.  Did he have the dog pound?  Of course.  Why would he do the dog pound when people were, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh?  He looks exactly the same, though.  That's kind of freaky.  Nah, you got a little close.  Oh, really?  Let me see that clip.  Oh, this is kind of personal. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  But I'm going to let y'all in on it.  All right.  Don't laugh when somebody says it's personal.  This is the prosthetic butt that Paula Abdul wore in her Opposites Attract video.  Yes, it did.  Look at him.  What?  Oh, oh.  Oh, my God. 
[01:03:30]  Paula Abdul, ladies and gentlemen.  Really?  Paula Abdul.  Are you fucking coming out like it's a big star?  Why'd you stop that?  I don't know.  Like someone cares.  Because Jimmy Kimmel is like, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah, exactly.  Like he couldn't be more relevant and faking YouTube videos and making a name for himself  in 2013.  Right, right.  And Arsenio is surprising people with Paula Abdul butt jokes.  Yeah, and it's his first show out of the box after taking, what, 25 years off? 
[01:04:00]  And we're all wondering, why did Arsenio take 25 years off?  Chris Tucker came out, too, later on.  Oh, my God.  What a magic moment that was.  More relevant.  Magic moment.  This is the same material he would have done.  Did Chris Tucker bore the shit out of Arsenio like he did us?  Oh, God.  Oh, what, Sam?  Sorry.  He was a bore fest.  What happened?  You were not entertained by him when he was here?  Bored shitless.  Maybe it's our job to fucking make sure it wasn't boring.  Snoop was on singing, though.  So Arsenio wants to just make evergreen shows.  They can be aired in any decade.  Any decade at all. 
[01:04:30]  You're right.  What a shame.  It was bad.  It was bad, huh?  Yeah, it was just bad.  I'm sure that will bring back Seinfeld soon.  I hope so.  Is Arsenio still mysterious?  You know how many shows that beats in reruns against the original program?  Yes.  Well, it should.  Let's see if I can find out who he's dating.  No, you're saying all that.  I just said, is Arsenio Hall mysterious?  Oh. 
[01:05:00]  Is he still mysterious?  Apparently he's dating Paula Abdul.  Oh.  What?  Really?  It says he...  You know what?  This says he dated Pamela Anderson in 1995 and then Paula Abdul in 2013.  I'm going to chalk him up as mysterious.  Mysterious.  Well, he's a bit mysterious on that front.  Mysterious.  Okay.  A little mystery to Mr. Arsenio Hall.  Yes.  There's nothing wrong with a little mystery. 
[01:05:30]  No, no, no.  Mm-hmm.  Who doesn't like a good mystery novel?  Yeah.  Well, of course.  Let's put some suspense.  Yeah.  And intrigue.  He's intriguing.  He's an intriguing fellow.  Right.  She then did her Simon Cowell impression and held the ass up to her face.  Oh.  Wow.  Yes.  She's been off the show for years.  I mean, Cowell's not even on the show anymore.  Right.  A little Arsenio X-Factor rivalry. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, it was crazy.  Paul Abdul wasn't even on the X-Factor.  I know.  Simon is.  Isn't Paula Abdul working with Simon Cowell again, too, or something?  No.  Or no?  That ended already.  That ended already.  Yeah.  He keeps switching out judges, right?  Yeah.  Shakespeare's isn't coming back this season.  Oh, God.  She was a train wreck.  She was so much fun to watch.  They can't admit that those shows are over.  Yeah.  Done.  The judging shows are fucking done.  Just done.  They're horrible.  Gives a fuck.  Yeah.  Like, what happens to the voice people? 
[01:06:30]  I've...  People watch...  But the weird thing is...  That's a successful show.  People watch the show.  No, I know it's a successful show, but what happened...  Thank you.  Nobody...  The contestants...  It's not making stars.  It's not making stars, right?  Charlie Clarkson was a big star.  The first, like, five American Idols or whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Giant stars.  Now, nobody is a star off those shows.  The winner of the voice sang the national anthem before the Ravens Broncos get the first  football game of the year.  Right.  I had no idea who she was.  Wow.  Oh, that's who that was? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  And the one winner...  The first winner of the voice was in a Pepsi commercial with Elton John in the Super Bowl.  Wow.  No impact.  Nobody knew who she was.  I swear to God, if voice people walked through the hallways, I wouldn't know.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't make stars anymore.  Oh, boy.  We're kind of dissing CeeLo's show.  No, the show is successful.  Yeah.  The show's successful.  Yeah.  I'm not even being...  No.  I know the show's successful, but my point is I don't see them actually making stars anymore  off these shows. 
[01:07:30]  But that's why they get these celebrity judges that are relevant now.  Like, they're still big celebrities.  Right.  Yeah.  And once you get that, you're never going to make a star as big as the judges.  Right.  So nobody pays attention to the contestants anymore.  Right.  Like, the original American Idol, the biggest star was Paula Abdul, and nobody had thought  about her in 10 years.  Right.  Right.  So the kids could become stars now.  Mm-hmm.  Not so much.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  We should take a break.  Also, Joe DeRosa's coming in.  He's got a new CD, right? 
[01:08:00]  Yes.  Very cool.  Good for Joe.  Yes.  And we're going to talk about Anthony Weiner.  I think Joe's annoyed at me for hanging up on him on the after show.  Oh, boy.  Well, you guys could, once you guys handle that, me and Ed will take a little coffee  break.  Wow.  What happened?  Maybe we'll, maybe me and Joe make up and handle the CeeLo Green interview ourselves.  You guys.  Well, yeah, sure.  You might as well.  Get a bagel for yourself or something.  Do it up.  Yeah.  Do it up.  Make us proud. 
[01:08:30]  Are you on to our shit at this point?  Yeah.  Okay.  Kurt Fox is coming in.  No, I'm Opie.  And he's like, no.  I did television with Opie.  You are not Opie.  I like Kurt Fox.  No, we'll come back for Kurt Fox.  All right.  So you're going to step out.  Maybe.  But you got, you got a strong hour with Joe DeRose and CeeLo.  Okay.  All right.  And we'll be back.  Okay.  Cool.  We're going to go get some eggs or something.  Yeah.  I mean, no one's running the ship officially, right?  No.  I mean, this.  Are we still in the.  Yeah.  Technically, we're still in the transitional period. 
[01:09:00]  But it's one of those weird transitional periods where the first bosses are kind of hands  off.  And the new boss is not quite hands on yet.  Oh, nice.  So, I mean, there are no hands on this thing.  Very vulnerable moment.  Yeah.  This thing is just shaking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why didn't Gary take his participation trophy?  It's still in the studio.  I think he was insulted.  Why?  Because you referred to it as.  It's the first fucking trophy we ever bought.  You referred to it as a participation trophy.  And the trophy itself says world's best secretary. 
[01:09:30]  Well.  Best.  So, I think that.  I think he's insulted by that.  Are there any dealings with him anymore?  Like, is it just done now?  No.  I said hi to him in a bathroom yesterday.  Hey.  That was that, though.  Is he officially, like, cut ties?  Yeah.  I emailed him yesterday.  Just because you had a question?  I wanted to know if they should still be on that email.  So, he said yeah.  Technically, the transitional period is still happening.  Yeah.  Technically.  Till when?  Nobody's moved to finance yet. 
[01:10:00]  When is he going to start counting beans?  But we're not going to have any meetings with him or anything.  No.  No, I mean, even.  Like, he's not even going to walk up to the door when the show is over and ask us things.  Like, that's done.  That's done.  Yeah, that's over.  Even our staff meeting got canceled today.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  All right.  So, you're just waiting for Tim Sabian.  I guess.  And then we get to start having big boy meetings.  I'm looking forward to that.  Are you guys going to come to some meetings?  Some.  Big boy meetings.  Yeah.  Big boy meetings.  I always wanted to do big boy meetings. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you refer to the meetings we used to have as big boy meetings?  Come on.  They were a complete waste of time.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Complete waste of time.  I mean, we all tried, you know.  Yeah.  Well.  I didn't want to have to sit there and watch you guys just trying.  Oh.  Sad.  Oh, I see.  And then see the, you know, reaction from them and the lost in translation.  Yeah.  Too much.  Imagine how we felt. 
[01:11:00]  I bet.  I'm trying to think of a, like a very successful band where they had that period where, like  it was horrendous because we just fucking moved on from that period.  You're saying this was our Gary Cherone period?  Oh.  Yeah.  This was like, yeah, the third, the third lead singer for Van Halen.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But now we're bringing back David Lee Roth.  Right.  Oh, God.  God help us.  So Tim Sabian's coming out in overalls and announcing the band is back together. 
[01:11:30]  Don't be smile.  Aerosmith.  What about them?  Done With Mirrors, I think, was their shitty album.  Oh, they had.  Yeah.  Before fucking.  Yeah.  So we're back to, we're moving into the Genie's Got a Gun period now.  Oh, I thought this was pink.  Oh, there was one before that, right?  We're going into Loving an Elevator.  What was the album right before Aerosmith had the big comeback?  I think it was called Done With Mirrors, wasn't it?  Maybe.  Something like that. 
[01:12:00]  And then they had, what, Pump?  And then Pump just put on.  Pump was the fuck.  Yeah, that was awesome.  Pump was huge.  That album's got to be close to 20 years old now, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, I got that from BMG for nothing.  Yeah, it might be more than 20 years old.  I actually remember listening to a lot of Pump as I was working.  And this was before the radio thing.  So, yeah.  Wow.  It's a while ago.  There was a parody song done to Jane's Got a Gun that every radio schmuck played. 
[01:12:30]  What was it?  I believe I even gave it a couple spins.  Oh.  Well, you know, parodies were very big.  Thank God.  If you could find it.  Thank goodness.  Pump.  Pump is 24 years old.  Holy fuck.  24 years.  What was the album right before?  That was Permanent Vacation.  Permanent Vacation.  Oh.  That's a great album, too.  Wait.  So, what was the one before Permanent Vacation?  Done With Mirrors.  Yeah, Done With Mirrors.  Yeah, okay.  Done With Mirrors.  We just lived through the Done With Mirrors period. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, dude.  So, we got Ragdoll.  We might have one more shot at this.  Dude looks like a lady.  Wait till Miss Doubtfire comes out and really puts us over the top.  We might have one more fucking shot at this.  Yeah, we could.  After all these years.  Get our own ride at this.  What was the song off Done With Mirrors?  I don't even know.  I think it was Pink.  No, it wasn't.  No.  Oh.  That's your Gnarls Barkley moment. 
[01:13:30]  They didn't have a hit off that.  But the music.  Do the Talking is the most notable track.  Oh, wow.  I remember radio stations were struggling trying to find stuff to play off that.  There was no hit on that one.  And then, I don't know.  Well, what changed someone who knows more about music can tell me, but all of a sudden  they come out with Permanent Vacation.  People are like, what?  Didn't they all go to rehab or something?  This fucking band's done.  What the fuck?  And then they come out with this?  Well, who produced Permanent Vacation?  Something drastically changed. 
[01:14:00]  I don't even know if it's because they went into rehab.  He can do anything.  Rick Rubin?  Let's just say it was Rick Rubin.  Well, I'm just going to say that.  It was Bruce Fairbairn.  Or him.  Bruce Fairbairn.  Rick Rubin produced which one for them?  I'm not sure.  I think Pump.  I can tell you what Bruce Fairbairn did.  I'm going to say Pump.  Yeah.  But, yeah, the parody was called Bambi's Got a Gun, see?  Oh.  Oh.  And the reason I bring it up today is because we're heading into hunting season. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  That was a big fall song.  Oh, it was.  For Morning Zoos.  Bambi's Got a Gun.  It's there.  You got it?  Of course.  This thing was huge.  Oh, it's an advertisement.  An advert.  Skip the ad.  Stupid adverts.  This is not.  Oh, this is not.  This is just a video called Bambi's Got a Gun.  No.  You need a song parody.  You've heard Bambi's Got a Gun.  Oh, no.  Turning the Gun on the Hunters.  I thought that was too easy right there. 
[01:15:00]  Parody.  Elmo's Got a Gun.  Stewie's Got a Gun.  Oh, God.  Oh, we want Bambi's Got a Gun.  Baby Got Buck.  No.  By Sir Hicks a lot.  Oh, God.  Baby's Got Buck.  Yeah.  Damn.  I don't see.  I got a new channel I listen to on Sirius XM.  Oh, yeah?  Yes, I do. 
[01:15:30]  Backspin.  Oh, shit.  What's on that, Ray?  Old school hip-hop.  Oh, my God.  Backspin's great.  Has Ed Lover on it?  Ed Lover bored the hell out of me yesterday.  We were driving home from the beach house, and he was talking about how he doesn't want  to be famous, famous.  He likes that he's just famous.  Well, he doesn't have much of a choice in it.  And thank you.  At one point, I'm yelling at the radio going, you're full of shit.  He's talking about how Jay-Z's life is a big, one big fucking hassle.  That, you know, when Jay-Z takes the subway, people all take the exact same subway, even 
[01:16:00]  if they're not going that way, because it's Jay-Z, and they follow him wherever the fuck  he goes.  And I'm yelling at the radio going, you wanted to be as big as Jay-Z.  Who are you kidding?  It just didn't work out for you.  Of course.  That's why I made the Ed Lover dance.  You don't get into entertainment and want to just not be famous.  Right.  He goes, I like my level of fame.  I never wanted to be famous, famous.  This break went on forever.  You just wanted him to get back to some old school hip-hop. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  And then I think he picks his own old school hip-hop.  I'm going to fucking go thumbs down on Ed Lover's show.  Wow.  I didn't hear one hit.  You got to play the hits for the white boys.  What hits?  What did you hear?  Well, like when I was listening prior to Ed Lover's show, you got a little naughty by  nature, a little, you know, the OPP.  Yeah, you know me.  You know me.  And I would point to myself, by the way.  The OPS would point to himself.  Wow.  Not cool. 
[01:17:00]  No.  I told my wife she wouldn't look at me for the rest of the ride.  I'd go, yeah, when this song was out, you know, because it's close to, you know,  it's OPP.  Hey, I'd go, you know me.  And I would point to myself.  She goes, she begged me.  She goes, please don't say that on the radio.  Please don't do it.  Don't do it.  Please don't do it.  And look what you did.  I go, the OPS-er would go, you know me.  Oh.  It's a very OPS-er thing to do.  It is an OPS-er thing.  I'm just happy to announce that I'm not the OPS-er anymore. 
[01:17:30]  That's why it's okay to look back a little bit.  And if you ever went back in time and saw the OPS-er, what would you do?  I'd punch him in the fucking face and drag him around the room by that, I think, I think  that's cool long hair.  Wait, I think if I grow my hair out, people will think I'm younger than I am, and I'll  be accepted by the grudge community.  I could squeak a few more years out of this.  All I have to do is grow my hair out.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then I heard a little Missy Elliott, Rain. 
[01:18:00]  Okay.  Stop the rain.  That's a great song.  And then some old Jay-Z song that I didn't know.  What song?  I don't know.  I didn't know it because he wasn't sampling anything.  Oh, he only knew the samples.  Right.  There's just room to hit it.  What was the follow-up hit?  Hip-Hop Hooray.  Hip-Hop Hooray.  Okay.  No, I know Hip-Hop Hooray.  That was the one I was thinking about. 
[01:18:30]  Hip-Hop Hooray.  That's clever.  Right.  And they love playing the Funky Cole Medina on Backspin.  Oh, yeah?  That's a power hit.  Oh, God.  It's called a power hit in the business.  Is it Funky Cole Medina, or is it the other?  Wild Thing.  The Wild Thing.  It's the exact same song.  They just changed the words.  Dude, the Wild Thing.  Like this.  Go to break with this.  All right, nigga. 
[01:19:00]  Come on.  Cold Cooling at a bar, and I'm looking for some action.  But like Mick Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction.  The girls are all around, but none of them want to get with me.  My threads are fresh, and I'm looking deaf.  Yo, what's up with L-O-C?  The girls are all jocking at the other end of the bar. 
[01:19:30]  Having drinks with some no-name chump when they know that I'm a star.  So I got them and shoved over to the other side of the cantina.  I asked the guy, why you so fly?  He said, Funky Cole Medina.  This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks. 
[01:20:00]  Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls will come real quick.  It's better than any alcohol or aphidisiac.  A couple of sips of this love potion and silver on your lap.  So I gave something to my dog when he began to beg.  And then he licked his bowl, and he looked at me and did a wild thing on my leg.  He used to scratch and bite me before he was much, much meaner.  But now all the pooders run to my house for the funky Cole Medina. 
[01:20:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I got every dog in my neighborhood breaking down my door.  I got Spudgeman, Alex and Strohs.  They want me and my dog along with that Medina pal.  I went up to this girl.  She said, hi, my name is Sheena.  I thought she'd be good to go with a little funky Cole Medina.  She said, I like a drink.  I said, I'll go get it. 
[01:21:00]  And then a couple of sips, she go licked her lips, and I knew that she was with it.  So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned.  And when she got her dress, it was a big old mess.  Sheena was a man.  So I threw her mouth.  I don't fool around with no Oscar Mayawena.  You must be sure that your girl is pure for the funky Cole Medina.  You know what I'm saying?  Ain't no plans with a man.  This is the 80s and locusts down in the lake. 
[01:21:30]  No joke.  Take it down.  Take it down. 
[01:22:00]  Take it down.  Take it down.  Black in the saddle, looking for a little affection  I took a shot as a contestant on the love connection  The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner  I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner  We had a few drinks, I'm thinking soon what I'll be getting 
[01:22:30]  Instead, she started talking about plans for a wedding  So I grabbed my phone and hit the door and said, baby, I'll be seeing you  That's why I found you don't fool around with a funky cold Medina  You know what I'm saying?  That Medina's a monster  Funky cold Medina 
[01:23:00]  After these messages  The O.P. & Anthony Show  We'll be right back  The O.P. & Anthony Show  The O.P. & Anthony Show  Continues in moments  Continues in moments  Wrecked out, living in a movie  Hot tramp, that is it cutie  We're going to continue now  Yesterday too  What happened?  Put that yesterday too  Continues in moments  Yeah 
[01:23:30]  Yeah  Wrecked out  Wrecked out  Wrecked out  Oh  Aerosmith thing  Yeah  Yes  Sometimes I sit here and I think I'm just listening to the radio 
[01:24:00]  And then you realize that  Oh fuck, we gotta do something  We are the radio  I think I would crank this one up still  This is the first album I ever bought  No  Oh wow  Really?  Permanent Vacation  Mine too  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And cassettes  First album I ever bought  Now we're talking radio bit  God, I couldn't tell 
[01:24:30]  Oh, it was Kiss  Yeah, me and Jimmy had very similar music tastes  And then I just went off the rails and he never stopped  I was into Black Sabbath and Kiss by Jimmy  But then I blew off the Black Sabbath for the Zeppelin  Which pisses Jimmy off  Do you remember which Kiss album it was?  Um, uh, yeah, it had to be, uh, like, uh, Love Gun  That one, like, Destroyer  Something 
[01:25:00]  Something  Something  Something like that  And then I got the, uh, the albums when they all, you know, did the solo thing  Right  I got all four of those  I think that was it  I think that was the first album I bought was a Kiss album  I believe  Well  I think so  What was yours, Ant?  I'm, I'm thinking  Boy  It might have been, um, it might have been that Boston album  Really?  Yeah  The first Boston album 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, yeah  That's a good choice, though  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That one was, like, oh  That's a great choice  Like, I think it was right at the point  Because I didn't  I know I had Frampton Comes Alive  But I didn't buy it  Right  I might have gotten that  Right  For, like, a present or something  Right  The first one I bought was the Boston  I got into music, uh,  Uh, late, really  I, I knew a lot of pop stuff  Because that's what was coming from my sister's room  When she was, you know, um  When she had downtime between beatings  Oh, Jesus 
[01:26:00]  I bet that was a lot of first few  Bad Out of Hell  Meatloaf  Yeah, it could be  That was probably a lot of first  That could be Bad Out of Hell  First time for a lot of people  That makes sense  For our  For our  On a hot summer night  How was that rock?  I don't know  Like, how did that come on the radio  And you went, yeah  I'm, I'm, I'm into rock music  Is he mysterious?  Meatloaf?  Is he a bit mysterious?  I think he's just an emotional guy  I, I, I  Emo?  He's the grandfather 
[01:26:30]  Or the godfather of Emo  He is  The godfather of Emo  What?  I'm gonna call Meatloaf  The godfather of Emo  I think he's a guy from The Cure  That might be pissed off at you  But  Well  Yeah  I give it to Meatloaf  We were talking about The Cure the other night  Yeah  Yeah, I liked a lot of their fucking songs  Did he?  Man, yeah  And then Friday I'm in Love  I was at BAB  And that, that, that song hit  And I was like  I was, I was done  It was over 
[01:27:00]  I mean, it's a great poppy song  But, I don't know  I don't know  I was never fucking into them  Even like that  I was never into the people that were into them  Oh  Pictures of you  Nah  No?  Disintegration?  Nah  Yeah, this is Friday I'm in Love  This is when I tapped out  This is when they sold out, man  But disintegration you never got into?  Nah  There's some creepy shit off that  No  No?  Fascination Street  It was always too fucking emo  Moody and 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, yeah  Boys don't cry  A bit faggy, right?  A bit  And we don't mean, you know, dick in the ass  We're just saying faggy  Right  I still believe there's two meanings for those words  Of course  It was a bit faggy, right?  Yeah  I kind of, I kind of felt like it was a bit faggy when I was listening to it  But I kind of liked it  There's something femmy about it  Femmy  A little femmy  What about like, uh  The weird kids listen to this shit 
[01:28:00]  Queebs?  Queebs, Quays, Weirdos  Yeah  What about Just Like Heaven?  Oh  I don't know many of their songs  What about Killing an A-Rab?  I don't know  Wow  I don't know many of their songs because I wasn't into them  So I didn't listen to them  Close to Me?  Yeah  I like Close to Me  You may know this from the Hewlett-Packard commercial  Oh yeah?  What? 
[01:28:30]  I don't  Alright, let's move on  My emotional side is showing  Some eyeliner on  Right  I don't know  I was all over the place with my music  Like, I couldn't find a specific genre  No?  No, I dipped into a bunch of these fucking genres  I don't know  Nah  But I loved grunge for real  I didn't want to open my mind up to a lot of types of music 
[01:29:00]  Because my friends would have called me a faggot  A Queeb, a Quee  Yeah, a Queeb and a Quee  Faggot  And Femi  And Fembox  I didn't want to be a fem  No  So I stuck to your basic, you know, hard rock, shit like that  Your southern rock was big during the late 70s  Yeah, Charlie Daniels  Right  38 Special  A little, um, Rossington Collins  Molly Hatchet  Molly Hatchet  Sure  Like  If a song had  A little whistle 
[01:29:30]  It rolled  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That's where I was all  This music breaks a little different, Iraq  A little different  A little different  I don't know these songs  A little different  What do you mean you don't know?  I don't know the whistle song from Molly Hatchet  You don't know Flirting with Disaster?  No  That's not the whistle song  There's a whistle and flirting  The one you did  Is that from Flirting with Disaster?  Yeah  Right before the lead or something  Or in the middle of the lead 
[01:30:00]  I think like when they're trading off double leads  Right  He does the whistle  But it was in a few songs  I know  I  I think there was a more prominent whistle  Coolest guy in the neighborhood  Had a 40-conoline van  Spray  And it was painted  Not spray painted  It was fucking painted  And, uh  It had  A big Molly Hatchet mural  On the side  Fucking Tino  Tino Nectarides  Did it have the circular tinted windows? 
[01:30:30]  Of course  It had the fucking bubble window  And it had a giant fucking  Battle axe guy from  Nice  Molly Hatchet  Was there a  Wolf?  Uh, it might have been  On the other side  Yeah  A bang wolf  And fucking  If this van's a rockin'  Don't come knockin' bumper sticker  And it probably was  Based on what it looked like  Gas  Gas, grass, or ass  No one rides for free  Oh, my God.  I forgot.  I just remembered something. 
[01:31:00]  So we're driving home last night.  Yeah.  And I thought it would be fun to kind of, like, roll the windows down and ask strangers on the street, what does the wolf say?  Uh-oh.  How'd that work?  What does the fox say?  What does the fox say?  Excuse me.  I keep getting that one wrong, too.  And it's not a huge hit yet because most people are looking at me like, what?  And cab windows would be rolled down.  I'd pull right up to him, what does the fox say, right?  So then my kid thought he would have some fun with the same concept, and his window was down. 
[01:31:30]  Chip off the old block.  And we were, right.  And he decided he wanted to yell out the window.  Uh-oh.  I swear to God.  Oh, no.  What could he have yelled that it was game over?  Right.  What does the fox say?  Oh, no.  Oh, I thought he said fox.  It's like, he decided to yell out the window, what does the monkey say?  Oh.  And I had to go game over and roll up the windows.  Aw.  But he's just naming animals. 
[01:32:00]  That's cute.  Well, I would hope the person that maybe would get insulted by that would think he was just naming animals.  He's a kid.  Sure.  To be misconstrued, though, I could see where you'd want to roll up a window.  So we quickly rolled up the windows.  I was like, all right, game over.  I'm not taking a chance with what does the monkey say as we're driving through New York City.  And he meant it in the most innocent way possible.  But I ain't taking no fucking chance with that shit. 
[01:32:30]  A little tater tot.  Back to Molly Hatchet.  Oh, where's Molly?  Have you seen Molly?  Well, Molly.  See, Molly Hatchet now.  I bet they could name some Molly.  Like, hey, you want some Molly Hatchet?  Right.  That'd be good.  And he'd be like, whoa, cool.  Speaking of the Mollies, are we back in?  Can we start taking our Mollies again?  There was a bad batch going around for a while.  I think we're safe, though.  We're safe?  We got a new batch of Mollies came in?  I think so.  Because we were telling the kids they had to stay away from the Mollies last week. 
[01:33:00]  We're back out with the Mollies.  All right.  We were the fucking wavy gravy of this era.  Telling the kids to stay off the Mollies.  Right.  Don't take the brown acid.  Don't take the brown Mollies.  Yeah.  Unlike everyone else, I got to say, I love Mollies Cyrus.  This wrecking ball video.  Wrecking ball.  She don't give a fuck.  Nope.  She's naked.  And she doesn't care that everyone is beating the shit out of her and her horrible ass.  Nah, I guess not.  But I don't think the ass is that bad either anymore. 
[01:33:30]  I think she chose those, what, those tight fucking...  It was, uh, yeah, the tight rubber fucking pants.  Rubber pants.  There is just something to Justin Bieber looking about her, though.  Jesus Christ.  Dumb face.  The short hair.  Yeah.  It's going to be trouble if she grows a mustache.  Simply irresistible.  She could probably grow on sooner than he could.  She's a simply irresistible girl.  Yeah, yeah.  Looking like Robert Palmer's girls.  Robert Palmer's girls. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, she's got a sledgehammer.  Look at us.  Yeah, I don't know.  She's got to grow the hair back out.  Oh, it's like it's fake emotion.  She's acting.  She's in her underpants.  She is in her underpants.  I like that.  Why is she making love to a fucking sledgehammer?  She's unbreakable.  Oh, look at her tits.  Yeah, no bra for sure.  No. 
[01:34:30]  I was just looking at her tits through that shirt.  Now she's riding a wrecking ball.  Her ass looks a little better when it's pushed up against a wrecking ball.  A wrecking ball.  Yeah, yeah.  When compared to a wrecking ball.  Whoa, naked there.  What's up, Miley?  This is a little risque, this video.  I don't think the children should see this.  Could you book us on the morning mash-up so we can throw it around with the girls?  I want to throw it around with the girls and discuss the Miley Cyrus video. 
[01:35:00]  Sam.  Mika's going to want somebody fired over this.  Yes.  What'd she say?  Holy shit.  I could have jacked off to this.  Like, growing up, this would have been ultimate jack-off video.  You know that the morning mash-up is just one girl, right?  It's just because they're all boys.  Yeah, but this is a really big video.  Everyone's talking about this.  So we want to throw it around with the girls today.  Like, she's fucking, why is it okay that she's naked from the side?  Like, she's naked. 
[01:35:30]  That's awesome.  They're going to run you out of town.  Will you shut up?  It's totally acceptable, Anthony.  Oh, dude, I got no problem with it.  She looks really good in this video.  I don't know if she has a good body.  I don't know.  But they're working it in this video to look really good.  Yeah, you got the side boobs.  Yes.  And her ass is definitely better than what we saw in the VMAs.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Oh, well.  I'll bet her vagina and cheeks are very cold on that wrecking ball.  I bet.  You think it's a real wrecking ball?  I bet it is.  I don't know. 
[01:36:00]  100%.  I think it's a prop.  What?  Are those real tats on her?  Yes, I think so.  You got some, like, prison tats on her fingers and stuff.  She's got the Michael Jackson Bad logo on her, one of her fingers.  All right.  What's this fake crying thing she's trying to do?  Acting!  Acting!  Line!  I saw her vagina.  I think that was her vagina, right?  I saw her vagina.  It might have been her vagina.  You're right.  How is this acceptable? 
[01:36:30]  I don't know.  She knows how to work a wrecking ball, though.  Oh, yeah.  Some parenting has to be done here.  Kids want to watch this.  This is just out of hand.  You're right.  I would just be jacking off.  If I was a fucking kid and this is available to watch?  Right.  Spanking!  She's naked!  It's one of your pop stars naked!  She's following that Christina Aguilera business plan.  Yeah.  She used to be a Disney girl. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, yeah, she did.  Yeah.  Remember when she was Hannah Montana?  Oh, boy.  Forget about it now.  Now she's naked on construction equipment.  It's a shitty song, though.  Well, it's not a bad song.  It's not bad.  It's all right.  It's no roar.  It's no roar.  It's a slow song.  How huge is roar?  Oh, God.  Holy fuck.  We should go over and talk to the girls about it over at Morning Master.  Can we throw the ball around with the girls?  Throw the ball around with the girls.  The girls.  I love when they come up with new ones. 
[01:37:30]  I can't wait to use that a hundred times.  See what the girls are thinking about.  It's just one girl.  That's the beauty of it.  Oh, God.  There's Rich and Stan and Ryan.  I was deeply depressed that we're moving on from the Radio Wizards.  So that's the new one.  Me and I want to throw the ball around with the girls.  Take some of these pop culture topics and let's just throw it around with the girls.  So it's Sal and the mashup that are in trouble after this Gary thing right now?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:38:00]  Have you seen the video for this one?  Ah, yes, I have.  We'll see you in the jungle.  Also, on the ride home, this song starts, and it starts a little differently.  And my wife goes, I know someone in the car who likes this, and I think she's talking about my young son.  Oh, no.  And she fucking left this on the radio for me.  It's you.  It's a great song.  It's me.  It's you. 
[01:38:30]  I like the part.  Who doesn't like that?  It's a big hook.  It's a great song.  She's got a good voice.  This girl, Katy Perry.  Yeah.  What about the applause song?  Applause is a good song, too.  It's not as good as this song.  It kind of grows on me.  But it's a good song.  I watched her on GMA with George Stephanopoulos.  How did he handle it?  George Stephanopoulos.  Oh, he's just the worst. 
[01:39:00]  Pum, pum, pum, pum, pum.  I like this song.  And she did some kind of Wizard of Oz performance piece.  Oh, good.  As she was singing this, yeah.  She's exhausting to look at.  Like, how much time do you have to spend?  I don't know.  And then she made her fans dress up as poppies.  Oh, it was for the performance piece.  Yeah.  Like a poppy feel.  Yeah.  It was a poppy feel, Dan.  Like, so, you're a Lady Gaga fan, right?  Right.  And you're fortunate enough to go see the performance at GMA because this one was inside. 
[01:39:30]  Uh-huh.  And then she made them all put fucking shit on their head to look like a poppy field.  That's ridiculous.  Remember when she used to do stuff like that and everybody talked about it?  Oh, yeah.  It's not really happening as much.  No, it's not.  People aren't really, like, going everywhere and talking about the poppy field.  Really?  That's the first I'd heard of it.  Uh, I think the days of Gaga are, uh...  She better come out with some new shit.  Done, skate.  This is new shit.  I know, but, like, some new shit.  Yeah.  And the album comes out in November, right? 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  Art pop.  Oh, wow.  She just said it.  What are the girls saying about this song?  Uh, you mean the morning mashup?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Majority, majority boys.  But, uh...  I know you like that one.  I love it.  Oh, the girls.  Poor guys.  What?  The poor guys.  The girls.  See, there's the poppy field.  Show Anthony the poppy field. 
[01:40:30]  E-Rock, you turn down.  Sam turns up.  Oh, look at that.  What ice.  What the fuck is she doing?  That's why I had to play this.  It's a real dog.  It's a real dog in a basket.  Yeah.  She's looking like...  I thought you were talking about her.  Oh, she is a real dog.  Usually networks, like, they're ready for a live performance.  They go, okay, we have the band set up here and this and that. 
[01:41:00]  Can you imagine the complications that a morning show has to go through?  Oh, my God, to pull off a Wizard of Oz fucking bit.  Why is she wearing a Mia Wallace wig instead of a fucking, uh...  Like, like, Dorothy thing?  What the fuck?  I don't know.  She...  Oh, it's supposed to be a Tin Man.  Gaze up the rest of the guys.  The Tin Man, the cowardly lion.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a sexy-ass Tin Man.  They're the gay version of those characters now.  Of course they are.  Why did she have to do that? 
[01:41:30]  Why did she have to give them up?  Tin Man looks more like a copper man, if you ask me.  Hmm.  Huh?  Oh, God.  On a scarecrow.  They are so gay.  I know.  Holy fuck.  You can see through the makeup, through the fuck, and everything, how gay these guys are.  I stand here waiting for you to bang the thaw.  I hate her.  Oh, my God. 
[01:42:00]  How gay are these dudes?  This is...  When somebody's allowed to be, like, a drama club kid forever...  Yes!  This is what happens.  This is what you get.  The scarecrow.  The Cowardly Lion.  The Tin Man.  On a flying monkey.  Flying monkey.  Why is...  Why is she doing this?  I don't know.  This has nothing to do with, because she never...  She never got a starring role in the play.  Oh, okay. 
[01:42:30]  And now it's her drama club.  Oh, now she's the good witch.  Yeah, she comes out as the good witch with a blonde wig.  She's blending.  But the Gaga version.  Right, of course.  Giving it her own spin.  Whoever was directing the drama club never gave her the starring role.  That...  You are exactly right.  And so she's now created her own drama club.  But she's the star.  I'm going to put on a little play, The Wizard of Oz.  Yeah.  And then they have to dress like a poppy field.  Yeah.  I just want to see Lady Gaga and go get some lunch in Times Square. 
[01:43:00]  Why do I have to wear this on my head?  Right.  She never got to play Dorothy.  So now she gets to play Dorothy and Glenda, and everybody has to wear ridiculous poppy  hats.  Yes.  Yes.  She's so overly dramatic.  What now?  I don't know.  She pulled the wig off, so what now?  Did she turn into the witch?  Her new shit is costume changes.  Yeah, she's the witch.  Yeah, now she's the witch.  Wait, or is that the witch?  Now I'm confused.  Why does she have the evil apple? 
[01:43:30]  She's got to give it...  Oh, there's the witch.  That's the witch.  Wait.  Wait.  This doesn't make sense.  The apple was Snow White.  Right.  It's all right.  It's Gaga's Wizard of Oz.  That's true.  It's her drama club.  And she's lip-syncing, too, by the way.  Of course she is.  Which performance art?  It's not...  Holy fuck.  CeeLo's here.  He's early.  What?  Yeah, we get him...  Get...  That's not CeeLo.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's not him.  It's one of the guys down the hall. 
[01:44:00]  It's an employer of Sirius X7.  He's here every morning.  Oh, it's not CeeLo.  No.  Oh, my God.  No, it wasn't CeeLo.  That was not CeeLo.  Are the girls going to be talking to CeeLo today, too?  Who are you talking about?  The morning mashup.  Oh.  Not all girls.  But, uh...  No, they're in...  They're out of town.  What?  They're in Portland.  What are they doing there?  I'll tell you what they're doing there, and that's why I'm taking shots at them today.  What are they doing?  Fuck, I don't miss a trick.  They're hanging out with Guy Fieri. 
[01:44:30]  Remember when we got the Guy Fieri invite?  Uh-huh.  Guess who was at Guy Fieri's house?  Because they took him up.  The girls.  Because they took him up on it.  What?  Because they took him up on it.  You asked for a private jet.  Well, yeah.  I took him up on it, too.  I just had a couple demands.  They all went out there?  No.  Are they doing a show?  Yeah, because they're doing a weird promotion, where they're going on some...  You know the band Fun?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Some of Fun's tour dates. 
[01:45:00]  They're flying out.  But I found this out over the weekend.  Yeah.  They fly out to Fun's tour dates.  Yeah.  They make this big deal that they're there with Fun.  Yeah.  They don't do shows.  That was very dramatic.  That was a very dramatic moment.  Wow, man.  That's amazing timing.  Right on cue.  I know that sound from a viral video, sir.  Yeah.  They're not doing shows.  That's the sound of the kitten.  That's the sound that's in the kitten video.  Yeah. 
[01:45:30]  That's a very famous sound.  It is now.  Anyway, what are they doing?  They're going to Fun's shows, but they don't actually go to the shows?  They don't broadcast.  They don't broadcast.  Yeah, so if a tree falls in a forest and nobody's there to hear it.  They go and they sit there and they, I guess, meet and greet whoever knows them.  And then what?  Do the girls go and get their nails done after the meet and greet?  It's just the one girl.  It's just Nicole.  She's the only.  Oh.  But.  Ah.  So, yes, they were flying out to, I think, San Francisco for Fun's tour date. 
[01:46:00]  And then they visited Guy Fieri the day before they went to the Fun show.  Is San Francisco a mysterious place?  There's a lot of mystery involved.  There is some mystery there.  Yeah.  That is some mystery.  It's a city of intrigue is what it is.  Yeah.  A lot of intrigue.  Yeah, yeah.  Any suspense out there?  Oh, a little bit.  A little bit of suspense.  Oh, yeah.  I would say so.  San Francisco, if it was a book, it'd be a real page turner. 
[01:46:30]  Yes, yes.  Never know exactly what's coming next.  No.  Oh, ho, ho.  Oh, ho, ho.  What is this?  San Francisco?  I don't know.  Those people go west.  It's about San Francisco.  Oh, let's go west.  Oh, it is about San Francisco.  Yo, Kingston Pete, who's a good one on the Twitter, he says that The Cure did a version  of Foxy Lady on their first album.  I didn't know that.  Really?  Yeah, CeeLo did one, too.  Oh.  As Gnarls Barkley?  No, as CeeLo.  As CeeLo.  He's in the band, Gnarls Barkley. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, but he's not Gnarls himself.  There is no Gnarls.  It's like saying, oh, that's Aerosmith.  But no, that's Steven Tyler.  That's just a dude.  Jethro Tull was always the big one.  Like, which one's Jethro Tull?  Right.  It's not Ian Anderson.  It's not like Marilyn Manson.  But wouldn't you have listened to that music if it was called Ian Anderson?  Why do you have to come up with this imaginary character that loves the flute?  I hated the flute.  Jethro Tull.  Yes.  He's the only guy, though, that pulled it off. 
[01:47:30]  A rock flute.  I mean, you got the, what is it, Marshall Tucker?  Marshall Tucker would have flute.  Can't you see, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The flute's on display there.  Yeah, is that it?  I think, right?  Oh, it sticks now.  I think there's cum in it.  I did see one of the interns cumming in your flute the other day.  I hope, please be one of the girl ones.  Yeah.  No, it's right where I need it to be. 
[01:48:00]  Who's that?  That's Lady Gaga.  Oh, that is Lady Gaga?  Looking like one of the Joker's girls from the 1990 or 1989 version of Batman.  Look how artistic she is.  She's just the worst.  I think she painted her nipple red.  She painted it, yeah.  They're too small.  I don't know.  I like them.  Yeah, they're something.  No, you need to fade out.  You could just go slap, slap, slap.  You need a fade out.  Yeah.  A little fade action.  Some shots, she looks pretty hot. 
[01:48:30]  But.  Yeah, I say what's up to Lady Gaga.  Uh, she's all right.  What's up?  How come.  How come growing up.  Our pop stars never got naked.  If the thought of any of like.  Debbie Harry.  Right.  Pat Benatar.  Seeing them naked would have been like.  And not just a fucking nip slip or something.  Sure.  I'm talking fucking nudity. 
[01:49:00]  Uh, Slim Linda Ronstadt.  Oh, right.  Yeah, they didn't get naked.  And now we.  You're right.  They didn't get naked.  They didn't get naked in Vanity Magazine fingering herself.  Right.  That's because she.  She needs a hit.  Fingering herself.  No, it's not art.  No.  She needs a hit.  Oh.  She knows she needs a hit.  So it's like.  All right.  I got to finger myself for a little while.  Wow.  And then she'll get a hit again.  And then she'll put her clothes back on.  That's how that shit works.  We all know it.  I know.  Who would.  Would have been a dream come true. 
[01:49:30]  To do the fucking.  The fat broad from heart naked.  Right.  How would that be?  What is she doing there?  Did she like cheese her nipple there?  Does she have like misshapen nipples so she drew in round with red and left off that top part?  I don't know.  It looks like she painted this little part red and then added some kind of like concealer or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Around.  Maybe they're.  She might have some grease stain type nipples.  Oh, right. 
[01:50:00]  And she's like trying to make them look round.  Like a sloppy.  With makeup.  Like a sloppy egg.  Like brown pepperonis.  The fucking yolk fucking breaks.  Yes.  She's fucked.  Yeah.  I'm not really into the gags.  What's that matter?  A few of her songs are catchy, but I don't like this nonsense, though.  This is just nonsense.  Really, it's just nonsense.  I don't know.  The more ridiculous, the better.  I love it.  Yeah?  Just so stupid.  Loving it? 
[01:50:30]  Loving it.  You know, like Pat Benatar.  Seeing her naked would have been like, oh, cool.  Look, Pat Benatar's naked.  That would have been a true.  Is that what it would have been like?  Yeah.  It would have been just like that.  That would have been dope.  Hey, look at that.  She's naked.  Should we break or?  Fucking.  Yeah, you could break.  They're walking on sunshine, girl.  Katrina and the waves.  Katrina's fucking naked.  That would have been nice.  Right.  I got one.  The Till Tuesday broad.  The Till Tuesday.  The fucking other one that sang the fucking Take My Breath Away. 
[01:51:00]  Berlin.  Yeah.  Nothing.  She would have been good.  What about the 99?  Right.  Naina.  Exactly.  How about the entire band, the fucking Bengals?  Oh, yeah.  The Bengals.  That would have been sick.  The Go-Go's.  Nah, there were some pigs in the Go-Go's.  Let's relax.  Linda Carlisle was all right.  And maybe one more.  Two out of the four.  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing, though.  We never got that.  The Jane Broad.  No, thank you.  You kids are lucky.  Jane, what was her name? 
[01:51:30]  Whelan?  Whelan?  Yeah, no.  I wouldn't want to see her.  Let's look at the Go-Go girls.  Oh, no.  What do they look like now?  You want them now?  Looks like a reunion for the cast of Grease.  Uh, yeah, let's look at the Go-Go girls.  Oh, shucks.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  By the way, ladies, gray hair is not cool.  Relax.  You don't mix that up?  No, it's becoming a thing where, like, they let the gray come in.  Yeah.  It's not cool.  Color that shit up.  Color that shit up.  Definitely.  Definitely. 
[01:52:00]  Wilson Phillips, naked?  Two out of three?  Yeah, two out of three is right on that one.  See, look.  Uh, maybe two Go-Go's out of the five.  Yeah?  Maybe two out of the five.  Let's see.  Uh, all right.  Which one's Belinda Carlisle?  Why did...  Wow.  Why did two of them look like Belinda Carlisle?  Belinda Carlisle's all the way to the right.  Are you sure, though?  I think.  Oh, boy.  Um, she's had some work done.  Oh, my God.  Which one is Belinda Carlisle? 
[01:52:30]  I know which one Jane is.  What did she do to her face?  I think it's the one to the right, yeah.  Yeah, Jane has to put the really dye her hair green.  Look, my hair's green.  She's the quirky one.  I'm crazy and quirky.  I never changed.  Look out.  I swear to you, I don't know which one is Belinda Carlisle.  That is fucking weird.  I think you're right.  I think it's the one on the right, but almost unrecognizable, right?  It looks like something's pulling her ears back.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, some mysterious force.  Right. 
[01:53:00]  All right, we're going to break.  We're going to get Joe DeRosa in here.  We're going to do some Anthony Weiner.  We're going to talk about the brilliance of Jimmy Kimmel, an old friend of ours.  Yes.  He was for a little while, and then, you know.  At N.E.W.  Yeah, he used to call in just doing football picks for our show.  I can't believe.  Susanna Hoff, naked.  Susanna Hoff, right.  Would have been fucking crazy.  Imagine her in a wrecking ball.  She's swinging back and forth naked.  It's fucking 1986 or whatever. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  I'd be jizz being thrown like Spider-Man web.  You make a good point.  I think we should get naked for our fans.  Yeah.  Everyone else is...  What?  That's not the point at all.  Sounds like something like Scott and Todd will do.  All right, Drew, we're on the wrecking ball.  We're on the wrecking ball.  Actually, you can sit on my face.  I'll be the wrecking ball.  I'll be the wrecking ball.  My face looks like a rock.  Todd, you sit on my face and I got balls on my face.  I got balls on my face. 
[01:54:00]  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my face.  Oh.  Wow.  Join us every morning as they're just swinging on a wrecking ball.  You're so right.  They would do that.  They would do that.  They would be that commercial.  They did a TV spot back in the 90s where it was them and Rocky Allen.  And then at the end, they kind of reveal that they're all naked in the pool.  Of course.  Why?  The gayest...  PLJ had the gayest fucking commercials.  Because they're packages. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they go from station to station around the country.  They just switch the sign depending on which station it is.  And like, oh, we have this package.  They know they just set up the cameras and let them rip.  Can I just say that the big bitch on CNN isn't fooling anyone?  She's the one I always refer to when I go, wow, that's a big bitch.  Yeah.  Instead of losing weight, she decided, I'll pull my hair back and people will think I lost weight.  That's not working.  No.  She needs to stand three feet behind the rest of the people to give the fourth perspective 
[01:55:00]  a smaller view of her.  Right.  Yeah, her stage marks should be three feet behind everybody.  Is Scott and Todd going to be featured on Jocktober?  It wouldn't be Jocktober without them.  Jocktober is going to be a little different this year, right?  A little bit.  Oh.  Going to get Denny involved.  Yeah, I'm trying to, but I think Denny's been very lazy about it.  Oh, shit.  This place just breaks people.  Denny's like the most motivated.  Not us.  No, no.  Not us.  We're the cockroaches of fucking radio. 
[01:55:30]  We're ready to go again.  Yeah.  We took our time off following it.  We took a few years off there, but we're ready to go again.  A few years?  Okay.  Yes.  Back with our tank full of piss and vinegar.  We're ready to go.  This will be the final shot at fame.  Oh, yeah.  This is it.  I can't do this anymore.  One more shot at fame.  Because unlike Ed Lover, yes, we want to be famous.  Oh, well, come on.  Ed Lover.  We're in business.  Well, I'm right where I want to be with my fame.  Really? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  You don't want to be on Yo! MTV raps anymore?  Who are you kidding?  That wasn't a fun time for him.  No.  Too much success.  Yeah.  Too much success.  Chicks throwing themselves at him.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  What a pain in the ass.  Right.  Yeah.  That's a real pain.  Anyone in the fame game wants to be famous and wants more of it.  Period.  Yes.  Of course.  That's why you're in this fucking dumb business.  Right.  Because we didn't get the attention growing up.  It's a business we call show.  That's right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  We're babbling.  Well, we start babbling. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Joe DeRosa.  Anthony Weiner.  Oh, and Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah.  The brilliance of Jimmy Kimmel.  Who I, you know, I miss, man.  What a coup.  We used to have him on our show, and then they fired Gary Wall, who was really close to Jimmy  Kimmel.  Oh, boy.  And Jimmy, a stand-up guy, actually called us and said, look, I can't do your show anymore  because they fired my guy.  I'm like, fuck.  We probably would still have a relationship with the guy.  Yeah.  We did well with him. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, it's a shame.  Too bad he hasn't done much since the NAW days.  Oh, boy.  Holy fuck.  That flash in the pan.  Holy shit.  Boy, he fucking just called out the media.  It's great.  Do we have all the clips?  Do we have the clip he did?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where he calls out the media, that part of it?  And he plays the clips of all the media.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, great.  Yeah, we'll do that whole thing next.  It is wonderful, man.  Him and Fallon, they just know how to work it in this day and age.  That's right.  It boggles.  It completely blows my mind that that's what Arsenio Hall did. 
[01:57:30]  He's coming back to late night.  He's coming back.  And he's doing the exact show from the 80s.  Oh, yeah, he is.  You've got to up your game.  Of course you do.  It's the exact same thing as the 80s.  Nobody's watching TV.  So you go out of your way to do stuff that the Internet's going to talk about.  That's the game.  That is the game right now, is getting on the Internet and having people talk about your  fucking shit.  Yes.  I'm trying, man.  I'm trying.  You're doing a great job.  I'm going into the slow-mo world. 
[01:58:00]  I'm doing everything I can.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, I'm dealing with cat food and kitty litter boxes just to get some fucking hits.  I'm just getting props and hoping he falls.  Yeah.  Yeah, just set up a lot of things he could fall off of.  Keep a camera on the fucker.  Put some catnip in a little jar and see if he's stuck in there.  Yes.  Wow, that girl came to work with her ass showing.  I was just looking at that.  Is that illegal?  It's the Miley Cyrus generation.  Holy fuck.  What's going on?  Yeah, no one cares.  You know that whole under-ass thing that is happening now? 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of the employees is outside our studio.  Under-ass.  And she's got her ass showing.  If she was in here, we'd have to close the curtains.  Probably.  She's out there.  She's out there.  She's cool, right?  She's very cool.  I like her a lot.  Look at her.  Yeah, she is showing.  Shit.  Dude, that skirt is really short.  Do you want to bring her in?  Maybe later.  I can introduce you guys.  I know her, actually.  Look at that.  She's very cool.  I've rode the elevator with her a few times.  Oh. 
[01:59:00]  With her ass showing?  With her ass showing.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues in moments.  And now, these messages.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM.  Are we playing this for Joe DeRosa?  Of course. 
[01:59:30]  I wasn't sure because we did Aerosmith last break.  Hey, you got walk-on music now, Joe.  Dude looks like a lady.  This is perfect for you.  Nice satchel.  You're a satchel guy, huh?  Today I am.  Yeah.  Carrying around a few CDs, are you?  I got some of my new album, You Will Die, available now.  I like that you're keeping it positive on this one. 
[02:00:00]  It's so funny.  After the first two CDs, I was like, the next one, I'm going to do brighter stuff.  Yes, yes.  And this one's darker than the first one.  I'm going to brighten it up a little bit, keep it on a lighter note.  And now, darkness.  Now, you know, yeah.  Funny.  I drove in today from Brooklyn.  How was that?  I should never do that.  I'm going to have a fucking stroke.  Isn't it?  I mean...  It's the worst.  It's crazy.  What'd you take, Kiwanis?  No, I took to Williamsburg, because that's right near my apartment.  Oh, okay.  And I came in... 
[02:00:30]  I mean, dude, just punching the steering wheel, just fucking screaming.  If I got stuck behind...  One more fucking municipal pickup truck, where all the guy is doing is tossing orange cones  into the bed of the truck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's no apparent work being done.  He's just blocking the lane and throwing...  And of all the ignorant rants I've ever gone on on this show that had no base in any educational  or whatever, this is probably the stupidest.  Fuck Bloomberg.  I blame him for all of it. 
[02:01:00]  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  There's something going on where it's harder to drive through the city.  There's less lanes to navigate traffic.  Absolutely, yes, yes, yes.  And it's all part of his goddamn, we're going to turn this city into a walking city, you  know, and all that shit.  But you don't think for a second that that fucking guy, when they turned down his plan...  Remember?  He originally had a plan where he wanted people to not be able to come into the city, into  Midtown, drive in, during certain hours. 
[02:01:30]  You weren't going to be allowed to do it.  And when they turned that down, do you think he just said, well, okay, I lose?  Because, no, he came up with another way to get less cars in the city.  Yeah.  So when the guy with the Afro son becomes mayor...  De Blasio.  Is he going to get rid of all that shit?  Does the new mayor get rid of all that shit?  Go fuck the bike lanes, fuck the planters, fuck the closing down half of Times Square?  Usually they'll just let Urban Decay do it, because if he gets in there, we're just going 
[02:02:00]  back to the 70s and 80s version of New York City.  New Jack City will come back.  Let's fucking do it.  They'll be smoking crack out of those city bikes.  They'll figure out how to fucking just smoke crack.  Fucking handlebar in their mouth, they'll lighten the seat.  Fucking just everything that Bloomberg put up, they'll be smoking crack out of.  The giant planters in Times Square, fucking smoking crack out of it.  You put your weed in it.  You put your weed in it.  Everything just...  They'll just fucking everything. 
[02:02:30]  Fridays will be a porn theater.  Nice.  Fucking the goddamn megastores, porn theaters.  Good.  M&M's store will be fucking S&M's store.  Back to the way it was.  I want to see it.  I want to see it.  I want to see it crumble.  He's turned this city into a fucking shopping mall.  Oh, man.  It's disgusting.  It's amazing we can't figure out how to move the people around still.  I mean, we have a unique situation here.  We've got millions and millions of people living on this island with, you know, no way to get to and fro.  But, you know, sometimes you've got to get fro-o. 
[02:03:00]  And sometimes you've got to get to.  Got to go fro.  Sometimes you've got to get fro.  Here's the thing.  To and fro-o.  There was a way to get around, and it was working fine.  There were car lanes, and that was it.  And there were bike lanes still.  And it worked.  It got a little traffic-y at times, but it worked.  And what Bloomberg did is the same fucking thing he did with the cigarette taxes.  He said, for the good of everybody in this city.  Sorry, I didn't mean to do the Bill Maher hands right there. 
[02:03:30]  That's okay.  I didn't mean to do that.  But he said, for the good of everybody in this city, I'm going to make it so there's less car lanes because we need to clear up congestion.  And all that was was a fucking excuse for him to hike the tolls at every tunnel and bridge from $5.  They were $5 five years ago to $13.  And he knew nobody was going to stop driving.  The same amount of cars were going to come in.  Same thing with smoking.  I'm going to hike it to $14 for your own good. 
[02:04:00]  Fuck you.  You're going to hike it to $14 because you know we're still going to buy the fucking cigarettes.  It's all about revenue streams.  We know that.  I got to bring up something.  It has nothing to do with your actual health.  I got to bring up something, too, that he's done that's very subtle, but it is fucked driving to the point where it's almost impossible to get around the city at all.  And it's a huge thing, but you don't really notice it.  The right turn arrow on the streets.  Now, here it is.  It's for the pedestrians.  Again, pedestrian friendly. 
[02:04:30]  When a light used to turn green, people would have to cross the street along with the same direction traffic went.  So if cars are making right turns, they're turning into the crosswalk of the people crossing the street.  So what they decided to do was give the pedestrians some time.  So they give you a straight ahead arrow so you can go straight.  But they put this red and green right turn arrow.  And that doesn't go when the straight arrow goes. 
[02:05:00]  It's delayed a little bit.  But the problem is there's so many double parked cars on every street that that straight arrow turns green.  And the person that wants to make a right is blocking your way.  So now no one's moving until the red arrow disappears.  The green one comes.  And again, it fucks you so bad.  Because now two cars at most are making it through a green light cycle.  It's fucking ridiculous.  And here's the other thing.  Oh, I hate that.  Here's the other thing that I'm pretty sure Bloomberg did that I have no basis for, but I'm just going to blame it on him. 
[02:05:30]  What is this fucking shit on the major thoroughfare streets in Manhattan?  For instance, 34th Street.  Yeah.  It's a huge fucking crosstown street.  You can't make right or left turns off of 34th Street?  No.  Until you hit a river.  Until you go.  You have to hit a river.  Yes.  And then you're allowed to make the turn.  What the fuck is that?  And you go past your destination like, oh, I just have to go right there.  No.  So then you go all the way to the river.  Then you can finally make your right and then come backtracking to where you want to be. 
[02:06:00]  No turns off this road.  And you'll see, like, I've got to turn there.  Right.  Nope.  And then you go, but then you're like, all right, it's a big city.  I understand.  So I'll just turn it the next one.  Nope.  No, you can't turn anywhere.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  You can't keep the power tacked on to where you've got to go.  But what is the point of that?  What is the justification for that?  Keep traffic moving.  I think, again, it doesn't matter that it's inconveniencing.  They don't want someone stopping to turn.  Again, pedestrian friendly, too. 
[02:06:30]  It lets the pedestrians walk across all these streets without having to worry about a car turning into them.  See, here's what I think it is.  I think it's another way to make driving in the city infuriating.  Yes.  Okay.  So then what he does is, see, he fucks you, he double dicks you from both ass and fucking mouth.  Yes.  Okay?  Yes.  Because he fucks you from one end going, okay, if you're going to drive in like I know you are,  you're going to spend all this extra money to do so.  Uh-huh.  And then on the other side, he's like, if you don't decide to drive, now you're going to spend all this other money doing this other stuff. 
[02:07:00]  The fucking day, because I used to live right over here.  Uh-huh.  The day that those bike lanes converted in Times Square.  Yeah.  When you couldn't drive through the heart of Times Square anymore between 12 and whatever it was.  Right.  The day that fucking converted, the MTA fares went up 50 cents.  Yes.  The day.  And I know he doesn't run the MTA, but they're without a fucking doubt in cahoots.  They're all in cahoots.  It's all part of the same hypocrisy, Kay. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  You know, but it's like, especially after when they went on strike and he went on TV and said,  you should be ashamed of yourselves, da-da-da-da-da.  You think there was no way they didn't fucking link up after that and go, we got to be on the same side here?  What does this have to do with the guy listening to us in Wichita?  Oh.  Who?  There's a guy in Wichita.  He's going, who gives a fuck?  I don't live there.  I don't know.  Okay.  Oh, maybe he's got fucking a problem in his city.  You know, the parking meter is going up from a dime to a quarter. 
[02:08:00]  Was this a bad thing to open to?  No, no.  I was excited.  I love it.  Because I was like, oh, I have something to talk about.  I'm all angry.  I'm all angered about it.  Because I feel like then people go, well, fuck, there's shit going on in my city.  That's all bullshit, too.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how they relate.  It's so fucking annoying driving around in this city, though, and he's made it only worse.  Joe, do you know anything about the C-Lo?  Because he's coming in today.  I'm a big C-Lo fan from way back with Goody Mob, when he was in Goody Mob, yeah.  Really? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  And he's got a song that he, Goody Mob did a song on a DJ Muggs album that I love.  It's one of my favorite rap songs of all time.  And he has a line in it that I really love.  And I was debating if I should tell him how much I love the line.  Oh, well, you should.  What's the line?  He just talks about how people get all this money and then squander it and then go right  back to where they started from.  Right.  And he just talks about, you know...  What's the line?  He goes, you never wanted to settle for the ghetto. 
[02:09:00]  And then he says something about, you're going to end up right back in Building 63 right  next door to me.  I don't know.  It just always made me laugh.  He was like...  Like, it was before he was really famous, you know?  Yeah.  So I love that this guy was like, eh, you'll be right back here again.  So much.  You know what?  That's fucking...  I was watching Arsenio Hall there last night.  Yeah.  And I tweeted...  The great Arsenio Hall.  I tweeted that I had turned on Seinfeld and fucking Arsenio's on.  And I had this flashback that I was broke and had to go to a real job in the morning. 
[02:09:30]  Really?  Because that's like, that's what I fucking remember.  Really?  Like, watching that and being like, oh, fuck, I gotta go knock 10.  And somebody said, was it a flashback or a premonition?  And I'm like, look, fucker, I will sooner rob banks than get back in a fucking attic  to work air conditioning.  You will see me in jail because I fucking put a gun in a teller's face and stole money  before you ever see me back knocking 10.  I think we've got a few shekels at this point.  Yeah. 
[02:10:00]  I love that you call it knocking 10.  That's such a...  Knock 10.  That's old school.  I'm a tin knocker.  Well, look, let's make a pact right now.  Yeah.  Because I'm ready for the bottom to fall out.  Oh, yeah?  You know, I'm just waiting to see what happens.  If you drop out at any second, I'm fully aware of that.  Let's talk.  I'll be the driver.  You're going to be the wheel man?  Wait, make a pact.  Make a pact to rob banks together.  Yeah, yeah.  Me?  You want in on this?  You're going to wait 20 years before my money runs out.  Huh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:10:30]  Let me make a pact.  First hit.  First hit on the list.  All right.  I'll call you up 20 years from now.  All right.  We can finally do that bank thing.  I'll come running out of the fucking bank, gun in my hand, fucking cash, looking around,  and DeRosa will have gotten fucking spooked.  He tore off down the road.  I'm like, fucking DeRosa, standing in the middle of the road.  I get spooked easy.  Yeah, yeah.  I get spooked easy.  Just fucking driving.  I ain't fucking waiting.  I ain't fucking going to jump in. 
[02:11:00]  I ain't fucking talking to yourself.  Just fucking.  Or he'd be the guy when you're back in your safe house.  He would fucking put a couple rounds on the side of your head.  He might do that so he doesn't have to split the fucking.  He doesn't have to fucking split.  I get spooked easy.  I talk a good game.  I punched a guy's car window the other day because I got pissed off at him because he  parked in the fucking fire lane and just got out of his car.  I'm with my mom.  We're trying to go to the supermarket.  He just gets out of his car.  He just leaves his car.  There's nowhere to go except in the opposing lane.  I'm like, I honk.  I'm like, what are you doing, man? 
[02:11:30]  He just laughs at me and just scrolls in.  Oh, fuck you then.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I waited outside for him.  He comes out.  I go, why would you park there, dude?  He goes, fuck you.  Your breath smells and gets in his car.  I got to remember that one.  Did your breath actually smell?  No, he's just being in his car.  I was talking to him from the passenger side.  He was just being a dick.  He was in the driver's seat.  And he drives off.  I ran across the parking lot.  I intersect his car.  He tries to pull around me.  I go, I just punch his fucking window as hard as I can. 
[02:12:00]  He stops.  He goes, what the fuck are you doing?  I go, what the fuck am I doing?  It was because of a fucking accident back there, man.  There's fucking kids everywhere.  Oh, shit.  I start yelling at him.  And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then, dude, the switch just goes off in his head where he's like, fuck this guy.  And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So you punch my fucking car.  Like that.  It's bright red.  He goes to open the door.  I back, I just step backwards and he goes, back up, pussy. 
[02:12:30]  That's right.  It's like, dude, I would have had no fucking clue what to do if this guy got out of the car.  Did you shatter his window at least?  No.  That's great.  So you hurt your hand?  All of a sudden, he calls you on and you're like, oh, shit.  I backed off.  And then he goes, that's right, pussy.  Back off.  And I go, yeah, yeah.  Like that.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, all you know is up to the point where I make a point.  I yell at you.  I hit your car or something.  And that's as far as it could escalate. 
[02:13:00]  Because if it goes any further, I think I'll be in trouble here.  I always think it's going to be like curb your enthusiasm where it's just going to be like,  I'm just yelling at the guy.  And they're going, oh, Larry, get out of here.  And it's like, no, in real life, people try to fight you when you do shit like that.  Why are you chasing cars through a parking lot?  I know it wasn't the right thing to do.  I know it wasn't the stable thing to do.  It just, it made me mad.  It made me mad that he was like completely, when somebody's not accountable, I get furious. 
[02:13:30]  The fucking, the other morning, yesterday morning, I pull up in front of the building here.  And if there's a cab in front of me, I'm already pissed because I know he's going to fuck me in front of the building.  I got to park in front.  So there's a long fucking opening by the curb to park.  The cab will not even pull in.  He'll, he'll like half double park with the empty spot.  Right.  In the middle.  Right.  And fucking take a second. 
[02:14:00]  So, so I pulled in behind him and I go, little, little, like, could you move forward a little so I can park here?  He doesn't fucking move.  Oh, Jesus.  Now there's room in front of him, a little bit of room.  So I, bloop, bloop, bloop.  I, I, I go in front of him and I back up.  Now I back up so close to his bumper.  So just to annoy him.  So he's got to now go in reverse.  Right.  Just to get back out of the spot.  Inconvenience him a little.  And then I get out of my truck and Kenny's there and stuff. 
[02:14:30]  And the guy goes, why don't you drive a little faster?  Right.  And I said, why don't you go fuck yourself?  Right.  And then he goes, oh, oh.  I go, yeah, oh, oh, go fuck your mother.  Yeah.  And he, and he's yapping and stuff and shit.  But I just, I'm just over my shoulder looking at him as I'm walking in.  And he didn't, that was it?  He didn't do anything.  But if he did, he could fucking, Kenny would have fucking beat the shit out of himself.  I was safe anyway.  No.  No, I got to get a Kenny.  I wouldn't want to put Kenny in that position.  I really need a Kenny and I can't afford one. 
[02:15:00]  You need a Kenny.  I need a buddy.  So you can yell at these people and not have to worry.  We got to sell some of the CDs so you get a Kenny.  Yes.  Yeah.  Sell these CDs.  You will die.  Available online right now.  I heard it's doing well.  Yes.  It did well.  Went to number one on all the comedy charts.  That's very good.  With no press, which I was like, last week I didn't do any press.  Good for you, Joe DeRozan.  The day of the release.  I did press the day after, but it went to number one the first day, which was pretty awesome.  Indeed.  Nice.  We got to do some Anthony Wienership before CeeLo comes in here, please.  Oh, right.  He's got that ad now where he's sitting on the stoop. 
[02:15:30]  We were talking about that this morning.  And the only thing I can think of is like, how many times has he jacked off on that stoop  looking at that shit?  I swear it's the only thing I think.  Yes.  He just looks creepy now.  I was thinking the same thing.  Like, oh, what a ghoul.  Well, you know, he's such a pervert, right?  Which is fine.  I have no fucking problem with the guy being a pervert.  No.  But it's like Ant said a minute ago about like, I'll rob banks before I go back to knock  and tin.  It's the same thing with this guy.  It's like, he got a taste of that sweet, sweet politician's lifestyle and he can't give 
[02:16:00]  it up now.  And it's like, dude, you got to make a decision.  You got to either be a politician or you got to stop showing your dick to people on the  internet.  But you can't do both.  You know what I mean?  And, you know, to the credit of the voters, they moved on.  They were cool.  Yeah.  They're like, all right, you did your shit.  You did your time.  You fucking apologized.  You did.  And then it turns out that he never learned his lesson.  No, he did it again.  And that's the problem people are having with this.  Yeah.  They gave him his second shot and he fucked it up. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  That he did it twice.  That's the fucking issue.  Lawrence O'Donnell called out Anthony Weiner, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Is it a short clip, Sam?  No.  But it's worth that.  But let me preface this by saying, Lawrence O'Donnell is a fucking piece of shit asshole.  I can't stand that, cocksucker.  Fuck him.  He's an MSNBC guy?  Of course.  I'm not, I don't ever watch MSNBC.  Well, you're part of America.  No one.  Apparently nobody does. 
[02:17:00]  It's like...  What about the Rachel Madden?  It's like HBO Latino.  You hate when you see a good movie on, you turn it on, it's like...  I'm like, fuck, man.  But you still watch a little bit.  It's got to be somewhere else.  It's got to be on American HBO.  I know.  Put it on the real HBO.  It's got to be on the real HBO, too.  I want to watch this movie.  You've got to play both versions.  Because you are turning people on to that movie.  They've just got to find their language.  Yeah.  Here's Lawrence O'Donnell talking to Anthony Weiner, I think, last night or the night before. 
[02:17:30]  Whatever.  Whatever, yeah.  I have just really just one basic question for you that I think a lot of people have wondered  about for different reasons over the course of the campaign, for me, it just comes down  to this, which is, what is wrong with you?  Oh, boy.  I don't understand the question.  What is wrong with me that I care so much about the issues that I fight for every day  that I have my entire life?  Yes.  That's what I meant.  I'd be like, yeah, that's what I meant.  God bless him for, like, just trying to move on, but you're not going to move on from this 
[02:18:00]  one.  I'm sorry.  No.  You have to go away for another year or two, and then maybe we'll give this whole thing  another try.  You can't.  Oh, it's like the fucking Chris Rock thing about Michael Jackson, where he's going,  I'm not the fucking kid.  It's like, dude, it's like he did it again.  That's it.  That's the end.  He can't stop.  There's no, I mean, he could come back out, you know, you fool me once, shame on me, or shame  on you, you fool me twice, shame on me.  It's like, fool me twice, shame on me, won't fool it again. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Whatever, some cliche about cheating, something.  But yeah, it's like, no matter what he says a year from now, you're still going to be like,  oh, bullshit, you just fucking, you got pictures of your asshole on your phone, we know you  do.  It's sending him out.  All right, hit play on this.  No, what I mean is this.  What is wrong with you that you cannot seem to imagine a life without elective office?  That's ridiculous.  Well, of course I can.  I don't know, are you saying that because I have things in my personal life that are embarrassing 
[02:19:00]  I shouldn't run for office?  Okay, that's a fair position to have some people have it.  Let me be clear.  No, I'm not.  You're not being clear, Lawrence.  I'm going to be very clear to you.  I'm going to be very clear to you now.  I have never once criticized you in any way for anything involving your texting.  I think your photography is just perfectly standard American photography that's floating  around the internet now.  I don't have any, I've never said anything about that.  What I find strange about your campaign is what seems to be your absolute desperate need 
[02:19:30]  for elective office and what seems to be your inability to live outside of it.  What did you do, for example, with your time away from elective office?  Did you find any problem anywhere in the world that you thought, I think I'd like to apply  myself to that and try to help some people who might need my help?  You didn't do that, you just set yourself up for running for elective office again. 
[02:20:00]  I tried to apply myself to it.  Okay, you're wrong, but I don't know, is there a question that I could possibly help you out  with?  All right, you started in politics right out of college, working here in Washington as  a congressional aide.  You then got yourself at the elected city council before you were 30.  You've been pursuing elective office for over 20 years now.  I've been serving the people of Brooklyn and Queens in the city.  Yes, let me, Anthony, it does not seem, it does not seem to be a fully healthy pursuit 
[02:20:30]  for your life.  I know there are a lot of people, there are a lot of people who talk, look, there are  a lot of people who talk about.  If you take in the totality of your life, Anthony, do you think you've spent your time well?  Yes, I think I've devoted almost my entire adult life to serving the constituents that I've  represented.  I've worked very hard for them.  I've fought very hard for the middle class and those struggling to make it.  Could you pause for a second?  There are a lot of people who don't.  Going through his fucking byline.  What Lawrence O'Donnell doesn't say, if Lawrence O'Donnell got fired tomorrow, he's not going 
[02:21:00]  to go work at a deli.  He's going to fucking try to find another job in broadcasting.  That's what Anthony Weiner's doing.  If he's looking for elected office, it's because that's what he does.  No, no, no.  I agree with O'Donnell.  I completely agree with O'Donnell.  Why?  Because from the brief stint I had in working in politics before I did comedy, the one thing  I realized was, these guys have...  Dude, it is like being a fucking rock star.  Oh, I believe you.  Yeah.  The workload's minimal.  The payday is fucking maximum, man. 
[02:21:30]  They make so much cash for doing nothing.  They get pussy.  Right.  They do whatever the fuck they want.  But this fuck...  And just like anything else, this guy now, because of his embarrassing behavior, is like...  Dude, it's like when you see fat Vince Neil.  You know what I mean?  You're like, dude, give it up.  Stop walking on stage with strippers on leashes.  You're not 25-year-old Vince Neil anymore.  Go do something else.  It's embarrassing, man.  And he's fat Vince Neil now.  And this guy is saying, dude, why can't you just walk away? 
[02:22:00]  You fucked it up.  It's done.  It's over.  Just walk away.  I like your take on this.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Because it obviously doesn't have a shot.  Yeah.  And if you're a newcomer and you don't have a shot, that's fine, because you've got many  years ahead of you where you can build up your shit.  But in his case, you're right.  He blew it.  That's what...  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Even if he went away.  Yeah, 20 years into this, you can't take a hit like this.  Yeah.  And that's why when you said if he went away for a year, I'm like, dude, he could go away  for six years.  Well, and he did go away for that year. 
[02:22:30]  Right.  And he did well with it.  People were willing to move on.  He was doing great in the polls.  He was leading or right there.  And then all the new shit came out proving that he never stopped.  And that was it.  Oh, boy.  The voters were like, well, go away.  Fuck you.  And I'm not comparing what he did to murder, obviously.  But it's like just the parallel to OJ or whatever.  It's like OJ.  It's like OJ did this fucking terrible thing, or at least allegedly did.  He got away with it. 
[02:23:00]  You're one of those allegedly guys.  No, I'm saying.  He murdered two people.  I agree with that.  I'm just saying, like, even if you want to take the liberal stance on it, you can say  allegedly or whatever.  There were people that said, okay, OJ, go away, and maybe one day we'll be ready for  you again.  And then the second he resurfaces, he kicks in the door of that hotel room.  I had to get my stuff back.  I did my memorabilia.  You need to get his stuff back.  Yeah, that was my memorabilia.  And you just come from the guy that just punched the car, I think, two days ago. 
[02:23:30]  What are you talking about?  I'm just saying, like.  How about you behave?  Twice.  Two strikes, dude.  It's not three strikes.  It's two strikes with shit like this.  Yeah, yeah.  Two fuck-ups.  I get your point, though.  Yeah.  All OJ had to do was keep his nose clean.  And all he had to do was keep that giant nose of his clean.  Oh, my God.  That is a schnozzle.  Wow, is it?  All he had to do was keep it clean, though.  That's it.  Yeah.  That was your only responsibility.  Yeah.  To stop fucking sexting.  Well, he tried Carlos Danger. 
[02:24:00]  He tried a new name.  He did try Carlos Danger.  Didn't quite work.  And then that loudmouth whore had to fucking sell him out.  Right.  It really is a strange addiction of some kind.  Because it's like.  Like, look, I don't have anywhere remotely in the vicinity, ballpark, world, fucking universe  of the money, access, or power that that guy has.  Uh-huh.  And yet, I still.  And I'm a dirty bird.  And I still somehow manage to keep my fucking dirt off of Twitter and off of places that 
[02:24:30]  are going to get me in trouble.  Exactly.  And it's like an addiction, man.  Like, it's the fucking thrill of getting.  He's like a fucking bank robber.  He wants to get caught.  Especially with that fucking.  He doesn't want to get caught.  He just didn't understand how the social networking worked.  With that job.  Like, like you're saying you.  You keep stuff off of there and stuff.  You're a fucking stand-up comic.  Right.  It's okay.  Weird, like, dumb shock jocks.  And Jimmy's a comic and on the radio and stuff.  If something happened where some of his stuff or our stuff got out there, it's not that 
[02:25:00]  big a deal.  Right.  With him, though, he should know it's a career ender.  Right.  So why the fuck do it not only once, but again?  That's what I'm saying.  It's an addiction.  There's some weird, like, there's some weird thrill of the danger.  I think that's why he calls me a Carlos danger.  Yes.  Let's go back to the clip.  He's explaining why here.  He's explaining his position.  That's a noble pursuit.  I disagree with him.  Well, what I'd like to know is why you didn't find anything to do during your time away. 
[02:25:30]  I mean, look at President Bush.  I'm curious about something, Lawrence.  Lawrence, let me try to squeeze in a word here.  You know, so I took some time away from Congress after 20-some-odd years of devoted to public  life.  I think I'm entitled to that.  Okay.  And what did you do?  You immediately offered your services to the lobby.  I didn't immediately do anything.  You did.  You went out to make money as a lobbyist.  That's not true.  You did the classic hack thing, and you know it.  Lawrence, I didn't do it.  It's not supported by the facts. 
[02:26:00]  It's not supported by the evidence.  You're just saying something that's not true.  You have a right to do it.  It's your show, but that's not true.  You made half a million dollars.  You made half a million dollars hustling your services for government intervention.  Lawrence, you can use however many pejorative words you want in your harangue.  Lawrence, do me a favor.  Do me a favor.  I just need like a hand signal when the harangue is done.  You're just putting a list of things that are not true in front of everyone.  I can tell you, I didn't lobby anyone.  I took time off from public service.  I came back because I had some important things that I thought I wanted to fight for, 
[02:26:30]  that no one else in the campaign was doing it.  You think public services is not a noble thing to do?  I disagree with you.  So I guess we're at a standstill.  Anthony, I think there is something wrong with you.  I know you just said that.  You just said that.  You're competing.  It doesn't make it any more interesting.  I'm looking at your life.  That shit is good.  He's a fighter.  You are relentless about certain things in your life that you just can't quit.  I actually took time off from government.  I took time off from doing it.  I guess you don't like that I did that.  You didn't.  You were a lobbyist, Anthony.  I was not a lobbyist. 
[02:27:00]  That's just, that's just not true.  Do you care that it's not true?  I know how you made your money.  Do you care that that's not true?  Anthony, come on.  I know the racket of ex-officials in this town.  I know what you did.  Lawrence, do you care that what you're saying to your...  Why didn't you do something for no money?  Why didn't you do something for no money?  Try to go out there and do some good.  You don't like the way I think you're a fuck.  Could you let me get you for a second?  Why does Lawrence O'Donnell give a fuck that this guy's making a living doing anything?  Like, why does he feel he has to do something, volunteer work, to be a noble... 
[02:27:30]  Talk to any of the other fucking politicians.  None of them.  They're all fucking shit-heads like this.  He's looking for his moment.  Yeah.  He's looking for his moment with Anthony Weiner.  It's not really working.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  But I also think, though, that he's...  They're kind of skirting the issue here.  Neither of them are saying what they actually want to say.  True.  This dude is trying to say...  Lawrence is trying to say,  Dude, you showed your dick on the internet. 
[02:28:00]  We forgave you.  You did it again.  Get the fuck out of here.  You're a joke.  Where's his specifics on what Anthony Weiner actually did when he was not running for office?  He won't say that.  Why?  Why wouldn't he?  Why wouldn't he say it?  I don't know.  I'm puzzled as to why he just won't come right out and just join Greenpeace or fucking the Peace Corps or some shit.  Right.  That's pretty much what he's telling.  It's over here.  Yeah, and he's basically saying, you care so much, why don't you go do something for free to show everybody how fucking sorry you are. 
[02:28:30]  Right, right.  Maybe you fucked up so bad.  And he won't say it.  And then Weiner is not saying what he's trying to say.  He's going, I'm entitled to some time off.  It's like, asshole, you didn't fucking burn out.  Right.  You showed your balls to the fucking world, and everybody was like, get the fuck out of here.  So you left.  And neither of them are saying that.  So it becomes this, like, other weird, like, esoteric argument.  All right, let's go back to the clip and see if he brings up specifics.  It's almost over.  Do some good somewhere, anywhere in the world.  Lawrence, let me tell you where. 
[02:29:00]  Lawrence.  Where you didn't make money.  Chillax, buddy.  Just dial it down.  So your critique of me is that I have to be in public life, but wait a minute.  But when you take time off for public life, here's the checklist of things that we want you to do.  I devoted that time to making some money because I had to support my family and not being in public life.  And now I'm back running for mayor.  Okay, yes, we've established those facts.  What news are you breaking here?  What I'm trying to get at, Anthony, is what drives you.  Okay, in that case, ask me that question.  Ask me that question. 
[02:29:30]  Lawrence, ask me that question then.  Well, Anthony, I mean it from a psychiatric level.  I don't care about your political answers.  Dude, I don't really need your psychiatric questions.  I don't care about your phony political answers.  Do an interview here.  Do an interview.  You are being driven by some kind of demons in some strange directions.  You want to ask me a question or do you have me on a riding with a split screen?  This can't be good TV for anybody.  You know what, Anthony?  We've got about 20 seconds left, so here's what I'd like to do.  I would like you to stay. 
[02:30:00]  Give me 10 of them.  I'd like you to stay, if you will, and we'll continue this online, and you can say whatever  you want.  Online?  You harangued online?  Nobody watches the show.  Who do you think is online?  You can say online for all you can do this.  It's been great doing a split screen harangue with you, Lawrence.  At some point, if you ever want me to respond to you, you let me know.  The question is, Anthony, what is wrong with you?  That's what I want to respond to.  Okay, I heard the question.  And I said, well, what do you mean?  Because I desperately care for the issues.  All right, we're going to continue it online.  We'll find out if Anthony Weiner sticks around.  We have to do this online. 
[02:30:30]  Anthony Weiner will do this online if you want it, Anthony.  Good night, Lawrence.  I love Anthony Weiner, though.  I love the fact that he's not bashing down.  He doesn't get flustered by him.  Yeah, I love that he didn't drop out of the race.  I love all of that.  Chillax.  That was fucking funny, man.  You know, Lawrence O'Donnell, though, comes off like a fucking...  Well, he tries to go for his moments.  He's holier than now.  Fucking, hey, fuck you.  Who cares?  What's the matter to you what I do when I'm off?  He said nobody watches the show.  He calls out Bill O'Reilly a lot. 
[02:31:00]  That was funny.  I think he challenged him to a fist fight.  Lawrence O'Donnell is one of those guys who's always trying for the big moment.  Who did he challenge to a fist fight?  I believe Bill O'Reilly.  I think O'Reilly would kick his ass.  No shit.  That monster.  What are Lawrence's politics?  Is he left or right?  What do you think?  He's a big lefty.  Well, he's going at the lefties so hard.  It doesn't matter.  At that point.  He's going after morals there.  Right.  And what's this clip?  Hold on, because we're running out of time.  Anthony Weiner, is this new or from yesterday? 
[02:31:30]  What is it?  Saying he's convinced he will be the mayor of New York?  Oh, yeah.  Just a real quick clip.  He was on with NBC.  He will.  He's convinced.  And how's that going to happen?  Aren't people voting today?  Yes.  In the primary?  Yeah.  In the primary.  Knowing how tough it would be on you and your family, you'd still run?  No one gets to go back and redo things.  I'm convinced that the decision I made was the right one.  I'm convinced that I'm going to be the next mayor of this city.  Convinced?  He's not looking.  He doesn't know how to re-pulls?  If he's convinced, you're now lying. 
[02:32:00]  Then he does have a mental problem.  And you're lying.  I love that.  I love that line.  You could say, I believe I should be, but you can't say I'm convinced.  That means everyone's going to pull the lever for him today.  He's fucking nuts.  Hell no.  And then he also just goes, nobody gets to go back and redo things.  Well, you did, Anthony.  You did.  You showed your fucking junk twice.  You get to go back and redo things you did.  And you redid it again like you did the first time.  You fucked it up.  Where's the CeeLo? 
[02:32:30]  He's chilling with Howard still.  Chillaxin?  Chillaxin with Howard.  Chillaxin?  Are they bonding on being judges?  Maybe.  Oh, they got that commonality going on.  There we go.  Okay, okay.  I judge people.  You do?  Yeah, just in life.  We might have to do that.  That person's an asshole, in my opinion.  We might have to do that less.  Yeah?  How's that working out, huh?  It's actually doing okay. 
[02:33:00]  I saw this video that said you shouldn't, like it told you how you have to look at other  people so you don't fucking go crazy and you don't think the world revolves around you.  And it's hard to do, but it does make you feel better when you're like, okay.  You're watching self-help videos?  It wasn't a self-help video.  It was an excerpt from a commencement speech at a college graduation.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you just chillax?  Yeah, we should all just chillax.  You just need to just chillax.  Stop fucking watching videos.  I like videos. 
[02:33:30]  We got to take a break, Joe DeRosa.  All right, we do.  And if CeeLo isn't here in seven minutes, we're doing the old passeroo because we're  not fucking waiting around for the CeeLo.  So what's his cutoff?  Oh, I would say 9.15.  15 minutes late is fair enough.  Okay.  Because we got Kirk Fox coming in, too, and I'd rather talk to Kirk Fox than CeeLo, believe  it or not.  Ouch.  You know Kirk Fox?  I do know Kirk.  I don't know him well.  Funny, quirky, strange guy.  Yeah, I like this movie Tennis Anyone.  He's a good dude. 
[02:34:00]  He used to be pretty much a pro.  Yeah.  And then he taught lessons for the Beverly Hills people.  It's a good movie.  Donald Loge is in it.  You should check it out.  Is it a documentary?  No, no.  It's a comedy.  Mostly based on his life because he was a tennis bro.  I mean, I'm sure that's where he got the idea from, but it's a scripted comedy.  I never saw this.  Is it funny?  It was an indie.  Yeah, it's funny.  Pretty funny, huh?  Yeah.  Kirk Fox is on the way.  Maybe the CeeLo.  And Joe DeRosa's got a new CD out called?  It's called You Will Die, and I'll be selling it up in Syracuse at the Funny Bone this weekend. 
[02:34:30]  So please come on up or download it.  O&A fans, come to Syracuse.  Syracuse.  We'll return after these messages.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is back.  Go on, sit down.  The celebrities are ready to entertain you some more.  We got ourselves a situation. 
[02:35:00]  We got Joe DeRosa, who's got a great comedy CD out.  Go get it.  What is it called again?  It's called You Will Die?  Yeah, right on, Joe DeRosa.  Yeah.  Right on.  Yeah, right on.  And we got a situation with the CeeLo.  And it looks like CeeLo's song is going to bite him in the ass.  Because what I say today is, fuck you, CeeLo.  Oh, Jesus.  It's over.  It's over, John.  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  Wait.  Uh-oh.  There goes a book.  What?  No.  A nice little book.  No, what?  I'm just saying.  It's a harsh thing to do to somebody. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, I see what's going on.  What?  He wants to scoop him up for the after show.  Oh.  No, I already have an after show.  I already have a big guest book for the after show.  Who?  What wrestler?  He's not a wrestler.  He's actually an 80s band singer.  What?  With some red leather pants.  Yeah.  No, he's a big comedian who's coming on to promote an album release.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the album called?  I think it's called You're Gonna...  Yeah.  I think it's called You Will Die. 
[02:36:00]  You Will Die.  You Will Die.  I heard he's going to be selling that at Syracuse Funny Bone this weekend.  Right.  And I got to show some Syracuse love.  Why are you taking our guests?  Huh?  You're taking our guests.  A lot of the guests just...  You know, Joe, if you do the after show, you don't do our show anymore.  That's the deal we make.  Well, you got to pay the price for the things you love in this world.  See you later, guys.  Later.  I got my pride.  Let me tell you what's going on here, just so we're perfectly clear, okay?  Dar. 
[02:36:30]  Howard Stern's an inconsiderate fuck.  Whoa.  Breaking some news there.  A self-absorbed...  A self-absorbed twat.  Ooh.  Who doesn't give a fuck about anyone.  Oh.  Ouch.  So, you know, he's got CeeLo still in there, so now everyone has to fucking back up their  schedules, and what we say to that is, fuck you, CeeLo.  We're moving on.  So tell CeeLo to go fucking somewhere else.  Hey, how you doing? 
[02:37:00]  Hi.  How are you?  One of the new interns.  Thank you.  That was a girl voice.  Another girl.  All right.  All right.  I like the girl voices.  How are you?  What's your name?  Nikki.  Nikki.  All right.  We're going to talk to you soon.  Hi, Nikki.  Round of applause for Nikki.  Business as usual.  This is the type of girl interns we need to have.  We're going to talk to Nikki soon.  She's not coming in and laughing and just lingering in.  Joking like it's camp.  Yeah.  She actually works.  You've got gorgeous interns.  Yeah.  It started with Sal.  Sal is beautiful.  Sal.  Sal.  Just Sal. 
[02:37:30]  Sal.  Sal.  They've been all gorgeous from Sal forward.  Yeah.  Good work.  Kirk Fox is going to be pretty proud today that we blew off CeeLo for him.  Is that what happened?  CeeLo will not walk through that door now.  What if Gnarls Barkley is here?  Will you have him?  Oh, you don't want to.  I'll be.  He just made fun of you.  All right.  Okay.  Now I'm thinking about it.  Gnarls Barkley.  Besides, I can't walk around with a pink book anyway.  It is pink.  If you're going to put a book out, you can't make it pink. 
[02:38:00]  It's very mysterious.  You can't walk around with a pink book.  It looks mysterious.  I thought that was the Carrie Diaries.  It does have a fucking sex in the city look to it, doesn't it?  Sorry, but you can't walk around with this.  Are you saying that book should be in the mystery section?  Yes, of course.  So we're done.  We're not dealing with shit.  With this new fucking era we're moving into, the Tim Sabian era.  Right.  Part two, because we did work with him in the past.  We ain't dealing with shit.  Good for you.  Good for you. 
[02:38:30]  So fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Don't take no shit from nobody, Spider.  Good for you.  Yeah.  I can like it.  And don't watch The Voice.  No.  Oh.  Yeah, absolutely.  That show stinks.  Why?  You know what?  This is what a good friend I am.  Last break, when I thought he was coming in, remember I said, I'm excited to meet that guy.  As soon as the tide turned, I'm right with you.  Fuck them.  Fuck The Voice.  It stinks.  Fuck everything.  Fuck them all.  Goody Mob's overrated. 
[02:39:00]  Here's the hilarious thing about The Voice.  Half of the judges on The Voice wouldn't pass The Voice if they were to judge.  Oh, shit.  Hey, did you write that?  Did you write that a little bit for your CD?  Just now I did.  It's not on the disc.  It's in the new hour.  For your comedy skits.  For your jokes.  You can tell some jokes.  For your little cunt jokes.  Go tell your cunt jokes.  I kind of like that.  You're not too far off there.  Yeah, it's like...  I used to be a fan of, like, you know, judging shows. 
[02:39:30]  Not anymore.  I hate them.  I've never liked them.  But it's not even the judgment element.  The American Idol was kind of cool.  I liked America's Got Talent for a while there.  It's unwatchable.  It's the gong show.  And it's so fucking...  Like, why am I watching Jugglers?  Oh, look.  It's a guy that's spinning plates on a stick like it's the Ed Sullivan show.  But he's got, like, LEDs to bring it up to fucking 2013.  And then Nick Cannon runs out with wacky shoes to make it all right.  Oh, look out.  Look out.  Fuck Nick Cannon. 
[02:40:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  That guy's a dildo.  Now Sam's going to cancel you.  You can't do that.  He loves Nick Cannon.  Nick Cannon's my boy.  I don't care about him either way.  You hang around with dildos then.  No, it's not.  He's a fucking dildo.  Fuck Nick Cannon.  Why is he a dildo?  Why do you say that?  He's a good guy.  He stinks.  Let's start with he stinks at everything he does.  No.  He's in shitty movies.  He makes shitty music.  And he sucks at comedy.  He was killing...  I saw him.  He was DJing...  The triple threat.  He was DJing a party. 
[02:40:30]  And he was moving the room.  And...  He is a triple threat in the sense that...  Nick Cannon can't move a room, Sam Roberts.  He was moving the room.  How do you move a room?  You can ask Troy Quatt.  Does the McElroy move a room?  Oh, we can't ask Troy Quatt.  We can't.  His name's McElmore.  McElroy.  Oh, he's another one.  Fuck him, too.  Fuck that McElmore guy.  You know, he gets all the credit for that song and he's not singing the best part of the  song?  Who?  I think that's bullshit.  Yeah.  The McElroy.  McElmore.  McElmore.  It makes me sick that McElmore is the face of hip-hop right now. 
[02:41:00]  It's like, dude, how did hip-hop go from fight the power, like Spike Lee, We Demand  Justice, to this fucking dildo that looks like Tintin rapping about thrift shops?  He stinks.  Stop calling, everyone.  This is the moment.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I'm very limited vocabulary.  I like it.  This is the moment.  I mean, you know this song.  He's a little more, I consider him a little more pop.  I guess you would say he's like the face of hip-hop, but he's not hip-hop. 
[02:41:30]  He's a power user.  He stinks, man.  He sucks.  But Nick Cannon is a good host, too.  He's better than Ryan Seacrest.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow, that's saying a lot.  Yeah, right?  God, it's so hard to host things.  I mean, the challenge of taking a completely written script with the easiest,  jokes ever to lob over a fucking fence and then say them in the most stiff way possible  to an audience of adoring fans.  My God, what a tough fucking gig that is.  Fuck him. 
[02:42:00]  I don't like Nick Cannon.  I don't like Nick Cannon.  He's supposed to be more positive.  I happen to know on a personal level that he does not treat comedians with women.  Oh, I see what this is.  He's never done anything to me.  I never met the guy, but I know how he rolls.  Any comedian slash actor slash singer slash movie star that has a fucking management company,  too, where he manages other artists, there's a fucking rat.  I smell a fucking rat, man. 
[02:42:30]  You can't play both sides of that game.  You can't, dude.  You can't.  Talent and management?  No, you can't be that.  And he's just another one of these guys that's like, come work for me.  He does the Mencia thing, like, come on the road with me and you're not going to make  any money, but you'll get the experience of love.  You'll get to hang out with Nick Cannon.  He's just a fucking asshole, man.  I don't like him.  All my experiences have been very pleasant, but I've never worked professionally with him.  Well, Sam, listen, if you'd like to be a comedian, I can tell you to enroll in the  Nick Cannon School of Comedy, because if you wanted to learn, why go to a guy like an 
[02:43:00]  Attell or a Louis C.K.?  You mean a comedian?  Yeah.  I want to go to the guy that was in Drumline.  Oh, Drumline.  He was on all that, too.  That was his movie.  What about Stomp the Yard?  He was probably in that.  He was probably in every single step dancing slash breakdance drum circle movie that came  out or whatever the fuck.  He did have a good radio show.  All right, wait, wait.  Let's get back to ZeeLo. 
[02:43:30]  Who's running the channel right now?  Our channel?  Am I allowed to pee on books still?  I thought you was.  I will say I don't have a problem with you peeing on books.  I peed on a book in the past, so if I do it today, do I get fired, or is everything cool?  Let's close the curtains.  Oh, man.  And then I'll bet everything's...  What was the last book I peed on?  That was the Brocabulary.  Oh, Brocabulary.  I haven't peed on a book since Brocabulary.  That title makes me sick.  It was terrible.  But I'm ready to...  Hey, look who we got here.  Kirk Fox, get your ass in here. 
[02:44:00]  Kirk Fox.  That's why Opie pissed on the book.  Cleaned up and spiffy looking.  Look at Kirk Fox, first time on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow.  You made it, sir.  You made it.  Look at him, he is.  You finally made it to showbiz.  You look professional.  Different, dude.  Why wouldn't I?  You used to have the...  I remember...  He took the mustache off and added the glasses.  You have to remind me immediately that I'm naked?  You're good, dude.  It's my home.  Take a seat right there.  Pull up the mic.  What's up, Kirk?  It's...  Give me a hug there.  Come on, bro.  Oh, good. 
[02:44:30]  I'm good.  Joe DeRosa doesn't get hugs anymore.  I'll hug Kirk Fox all day long.  All right.  Good to see you, buddy.  Good, man.  Pull up the mic, the headphones, whatever you need.  We worked together out there in Hollywood.  Huh?  Did you?  No, if you were late, I hope he would tell you to go fuck yourself.  No, no.  That's what he does.  Let me tell you what's going on here, Kirk.  Let me just take it in.  I just...  Yeah.  I'm not big in the city.  I don't like this much cement.  I prefer...  Oh, really?  I prefer outdoors.  Like, just living in a tent somewhere. 
[02:45:00]  Big buildings are bothering you?  Well, I'm getting used to them, but they just...  They're leading me into different rooms and making me talk.  And I...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not ready.  You're not ready.  Don't do that.  You know.  We'll do that on a radio tour.  Let me set it up for you.  Okay, I hope he...  Who should be...  Are we on the air?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Who should be sitting in that seat?  CeeLo.  We don't need him today.  Nope.  We sure don't.  We pull off the CeeLo for the Kirk Fox.  He might be sitting in this seat.  Have you seen how small he is?  He's a tiny guy, but he's wide.  He's a tiny guy. 
[02:45:30]  I might be on top of him.  He's very heavy, but he's very short.  I worked with CeeLo on How to Rock.  How to Rock.  What was that?  What was that?  That was a Nickelodeon show that I played the teacher.  Oh.  And he came in there and did some singing.  He did some of that singing that he does well, huh?  I feel good.  How long ago was that?  Right before we did...  Who gets the last time?  You forgot that show.  I don't even remember.  I think everyone else forgot it.  Last year.  Oh, okay.  I think everyone else forgot that show.  Remember the rumor was they were picking up a second season? 
[02:46:00]  Are you kidding?  They barely picked up the first season.  I know.  Well, didn't they do the exact same thing with Howie Mandel or something?  Yeah, it's right after the TBS version.  Yeah, yeah.  So Howie won.  But I don't know as to inside, but when we had to film the audience thing and present our pranks,  why didn't they have you guys there?  You guys did all the work.  I would have come there.  They wouldn't validate parking.  Oh, man.  So I just didn't want to start losing money on the operation.  I hear you.  And it was pretty far. 
[02:46:30]  It was out in the valley.  It was fun, though.  I like to stay within three miles of my place.  A little agoraphobic?  Kirk Fox.  I don't know if I want to go that deep, but I prefer to stay in my room.  Really?  Now I have a TV show, so suddenly I'm in New York.  Are you filming in New York?  That's crazy.  No, I'm out here doing...  Just the press work?  A lot of press.  It's called The Test.  Yes, it is.  What is it, man?  Lie detector, DNA, drug test.  Somebody's coming on the show.  They need an answer.  I'm going to give them that answer. 
[02:47:00]  But if you're the guy that you know you're guilty of this shit, why would you go on the  show?  Oh, man.  A lot of people come on there for safety.  They feel that they're not going to get killed if there's a million people watching.  A lot of people think they can beat the test.  And you're in a situation where your girlfriend says, I want you to take a lie detector test.  If you say no, you're immediately guilty.  So a lot of these guys say yes and then hope within an hour or so she'll forget.  Or maybe the plane will go down on the way to...  Right, right.  Or somehow the test itself gets fucked up. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, they try.  All right.  I like this.  An EMP in the middle of the show.  All electricity's lost.  We have it all.  But there's some serious conflict and I'm in the middle.  But this show's great because it's not just about the conflict.  You know, a lot of the other shows, they just want the fights and then they're done.  We're getting the fights and then I'm trying to stop the fights quick for safety.  Right.  Because I get scared.  And then we try and resolve the situation.  So this show takes elements of every show that you like. 
[02:48:00]  You know, courtroom, little Maury, little Jerry.  Little, you know, we're helping as well.  Nice.  How do you resolve something like this is not your baby or, you know...  Well, you don't resolve that.  The fact is it's your baby.  Now what?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you've created life, that life is there.  So now, are you going to raise it?  Are you going to be a good father?  No.  Are you going to take responsibility?  Oh, I thought you were talking to me.  Listen, I have a lazy eye.  I'm going to rarely talk to you.  All right, good.  Everything's going to Opie unless my eye drifts. 
[02:48:30]  That's all right.  I'll just interview CeeLo in the hallway.  That's all right.  He's in here.  CeeLo's in here.  He just doesn't talk much.  Under the console doing jumping jacks.  He's quiet.  Fuck to CeeLo.  See, I saw him bit him in the ass there, Kirk Fox.  Well, what happened?  He just didn't want...  He can't come up with a fuck you song and think people aren't going to use it against him.  He didn't want to be here because I could put a lie detector and ask him if he has problems with you guys.  Exactly.  He's running late with Howard, so, you know, we say fuck it.  You know, we had you.  You know what?  You know what he should do?  Blowing you off to have the CeeLo.  When he shows up, don't even let him in. 
[02:49:00]  How about that?  What?  I'm watching the trailer for the test.  Holy shit.  It doesn't really seem like you're avoiding conflict.  No, I see people...  Wow, that one just kicks someone in the head.  Someone's getting punched in the face.  Wait, I want to hear this audio.  Okay.  Start over.  Start over.  Let's see what's going on here.  Coming up this evening.  What's your show?  You better know.  Oh, you smell it.  Oh, smack.  Summer is over.  She go from dude to dude to dude.  Is you a prostitute?  This is your prostitute business.  Oh, that sounds good.  Family business. 
[02:49:30]  No, no, no.  Yes, yes, yes.  Family time.  My daughter calls him daddy.  You left.  You left.  Holy cow.  Don't let a piece of shit like this break your heart.  But to fix the family...  You're not going to sit down like that.  I want my mother.  Oh, my sister.  You've got to know who your family is first.  It's either Marty, Scotty, or Ricky.  This ain't my family.  I've had to live my life without a father figure.  How many birthdays?  How many holidays?  America's most colorful families... 
[02:50:00]  You need help.  You need help.  Are you joking?  Oh, on the brand new season of The Test.  I want my mommy.  I want my mommy.  That show looks fucking awesome.  What the fuck are you doing to these people?  Listen, I'm doing whatever I can to...  You're doing God's work, sir.  If I could point out...  To jack them up a little.  Yes, Joe.  If I may make a point...  Yes, you can.  Poor choice of words.  America's most colorful families.  I would have used a different word there. 
[02:50:30]  They are very colorful.  Listen, if you look closely, we...  It runs the gamut.  Of course.  It runs the gamut.  Everybody's got problems.  Yes.  He's sitting...  Every clip is Kirk just sitting there with his legs crossed with the cards.  Yeah.  Like, with this expression, like, I don't know why these people are freaking out.  We didn't see you bring up one fight.  Listen, was it something I said?  But the best part about this show is that they had me join a gym to put on some muscle  just in case.  Just in case you got to jump in? 
[02:51:00]  Are you serious?  Of course.  In case you got to throw.  Oh.  I didn't come into the game with a lot of muscle.  Right.  Mostly sharp edges.  I'm a little rusty.  Right, right.  Dude, they didn't want to lose money on people needing tetanus shots.  But now I'm stronger and I can get out quicker.  Right.  You can move out of the way.  You're so quiet in the clips.  It looks like every family just has this tall white guy as part of the family.  Just kind of just there.  Just there.  Just a cousin.  That's good casting.  It is. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  You know, what do you want me to do?  Just read the results and stay out of their way.  Right.  Nice.  There you go.  And how much do I pay you for this?  No, we'll pay you.  Sign me up.  Great.  I'm in.  All I had to lose was the mustache and, you know.  Why would they take your mustache away?  You've had it forever.  How many years on the mustache?  Listen, it's been a part of me for at least 10.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I think this is the first job I've had without it.  Wow.  I want it back.  My lip feels like it needs it. 
[02:52:00]  I just don't think they wanted someone who looks like a cop.  Right.  In between people who don't want to talk to cops.  And you had the glasses.  So you look completely different.  I've always had astigmatism.  But now they're utilizing it.  And I did not have a suit.  No.  No.  At first I had to borrow a suit from one of the doctors.  Because the executive producer also does the doctors.  Okay.  Jay McGraw.  So I had to borrow clothes. 
[02:52:30]  No kidding.  You're wearing the same suit that you're wearing in the trailer.  That's the only clothes I got.  I travel light.  Basically they gave a homeless man a syndicated TV show.  I think it's going to do well, Kirk.  Yeah.  Hey, listen.  Everyone watched it yesterday here in town.  I mean, huge numbers.  Did he get...  Oh, it started yesterday?  It premiered yesterday.  Oh, and you did well, huh?  Changed the world.  How many numbers?  Changed the world.  How many numbers?  I'm not going to tell you because I don't know if I'm allowed to, but big. 
[02:53:00]  They were very happy with the numbers.  Yeah, they said, maybe we'll get you another suit.  Oh, that would be nice.  That would be nice.  That's not bad.  What it was so sad at all.  I just want a different shirt.  This shirt actually stands up on its own now.  Just in the corner.  So what are you dealing with?  You're dealing with paternities, obviously.  With some of those.  Paternity.  Paternity.  Maternity.  Yeah.  Listen, anything that can be tested.  Okay.  Cheating.  If somebody wants the truth, they will get it. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Did you steal something?  Right.  Did you steal my car?  What's going on here?  What kind of oddity?  Open the door.  I want to say fuck you to CeeLo.  He's walking through.  Hey, where is CeeLo?  Because we can talk about how to rock.  Do you want to get a little something going here?  Yeah, I got to talk to him because I wanted one of his watches.  Oh, boy.  Oh, it's an exciting day today.  I'm very excited about this.  Lord and Lord.  Where are we going to fall?  Where are we going to fall?  We can ask him a few things.  There's a fire here on Opie and Anthony. 
[02:54:00]  Lord, there's a fire.  There's a fire.  There's something burning in here.  There's something burning on Opie and Anthony.  I think they went that way already.  Oh, they went the long way?  They're on Alky already.  He's in already.  But he didn't come through our way.  Did he see me in here?  He did.  Of course he left.  I didn't see him.  Is he that short?  I didn't see him walk by.  It's very short.  Wait, he is in here.  See you later.  There he is.  Hey, Kirk, did you get a new car yet?  I'm obsessed with your car ever since I heard about it on the Jay Moore podcast.  I still have it. 
[02:54:30]  What year is it again?  I can't shake it.  It's a 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid.  Wow.  The great thing, here's the best part of this, because everyone wants me to get a new car  because they think, you know, it's embarrassing.  You should, yeah.  Whenever I leave Paramount, I always ask these guys, I'm like, listen, is there any other  talk show host in the world driving a piece of shit like this?  And they said, Sean Penn drives an 87 Tercel.  Oh, he does?  And he has since 87. 
[02:55:00]  No way.  So now I'm looking to buy an 86 Tercel.  Something a little older.  I'm just going to one-up him.  I'm not going 87.  I've got to go one better than Sean Penn.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you got one of the first hybrid cars, basically.  Listen, I think I got the one they drew.  Right.  I can't shake it.  I'm just such a creature of habit.  Like, when I think, I've thought about getting a new car, and every time I start driving toward  a car dealer, my car starts running better.  Oh, really?  Like it knows.  Yeah, like a girlfriend when you're about to dump her, she starts doing things. 
[02:55:30]  Right, right.  That's how I feel in my cars.  It's like the day when you want to get your hair cut.  Yeah.  And you go, fuck, I don't need a haircut.  I look good at it.  I haven't even washed my car in a few years, because I feel if I wash it, it'll start to  unravel.  Yeah.  It's just leave it.  It's like my favorite shirt.  How many miles?  Just leave it alone.  Well, I think I've gone to the moon and back.  Yeah.  A lot of miles.  You don't miss the amenities of a newer vehicle, some of the luxuries.  No, because I'm not aware that they have any. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, they're amazing.  I've never changed my life, dude.  I've never been in one.  Like GPS?  Yeah.  What's going to change my life?  When you get a new car, I didn't have a car since I was in college, because I lived  here.  And then I bought a car, and it's like, dude, as soon as you step in, there's like the  Bluetooth thing where your phone is coming through your speakers.  Listen, I'd rather just have a dead tooth.  I want my Bluetooth, my own.  I'm telling you, it's like you get a new car.  It's like jumping from a flip phone to the iPhone 5. 
[02:56:30]  You're going to be like, what the fuck?  I used to think about getting a new car to show off.  Like, listen, I got my shit together.  But now that I have my own TV show, I can drive anything I want.  Yeah.  There you go.  Good for Kurt.  That car finally came into style.  Do you have the portable, I mean, a takeout navigation thing?  Do you stick it to the windshield?  How do you get from...  I barely...  I don't go far.  You don't go that far.  No?  So you don't even need navigation.  I don't leave within three miles.  Three mile.  I go to the comedy store.  You live close to the comedy store?  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  Up in the hills there.  A little bit.  Nice.  Not...  Down in the flats.  Yeah, not way up in the hills.  I like to be down there with the people.  Okay, you're down near the people.  I like to be, yeah.  We shoot at Paramount.  I'm all within three miles.  No kidding.  Parks and Rec is right over the hill within three miles.  I've turned down jobs that are four miles out.  It's like when you gamble, you know.  Three miles off the coast, you're okay.  Yeah.  I want to know a little more about you, Kirk Fox.  Where did you come from, man?  Are you an L.A. guy or... 
[02:57:30]  San Diego, California.  San Diego, California.  Yes, sir.  You come up to L.A. to do the comedy?  No.  Comedy was...  I was a late bloomer.  I came up to L.A. to teach tennis to directors and try and sneak my way into movies.  That's true, right?  Why would I say it if it wasn't?  But how good were you at tennis?  Nationally ranked?  Yeah, I was good.  I was a pro.  Who'd you beat?  Anyone we know?  I beat a guy at a Honda dealership out of a 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid.  Listen, clearly I didn't beat enough people. 
[02:58:00]  Or I wouldn't be teaching tennis in Hollywood for scraps.  That's a pretty good...  That's like a movie-type job right there, though.  Yeah, I'm a tennis pro in Hollywood.  I made a movie with Donald Lowe.  He liked it.  I have not seen it.  It's called Tennis Anyone, but he actually said it.  It was good.  I don't know if you remember, man.  We met years ago.  Of course I remember you.  I've been trying to forget.  I didn't know you'd bring it up.  Jeez, Kirk.  Listen, I've been in front of confrontation for the last three months.  I know, of course. 
[02:58:30]  Don't take it out on me.  You know what I mean?  We'll be right back.  It has rubbed off on him, I think.  It has a little bit.  Yeah, where's that big mouth when they're fighting on the show?  You get real quiet and sit in the corner.  You gotta let the fights go, though.  You gotta make believe you care enough to try to stop it, but you gotta...  I know.  It's a science, I think.  I got you.  We met through Burr, through Bill Burr.  I don't know.  It has to be seven years ago, but it was when Burr and I were first starting to talk about  making, trying to make a movie together, which we eventually did with Bobby, and you told 
[02:59:00]  me about tennis, and he won, and then years later, it was finally, I saw it on Netflix.  It was good, man.  It did what it was supposed to do.  Paul Rudd was in there, and Jason Isaacs, and Donald directed it.  You got Paul Rudd in the movie?  Yes, we do.  Wow.  Did he play Paul Rudd, though?  He played a porn star.  I don't know what he does when he's not working.  He plays a lot of Paul Rudd.  I like Paul Rudd.  It's our bit.  Paul Rudd plays Paul Rudd in every movie.  I'm hoping you got the Paul Rudd that didn't play Paul Rudd.  Who's better at Paul Rudd than Paul Rudd? 
[02:59:30]  Good point, Kirk Fox.  Listen, if you find something that makes you millions, why snap it?  Good point.  Do you play Opie?  No.  Well, you should.  You'd make more money.  Yeah, Woody Allen plays Woody Allen.  It's like, you know, you do your thing.  So you were nationally ranked as a tennis bro.  Yes, I was.  And then said, fuck it, I could go up there to L.A. and teach some of these Bettys.  You know, I was out there trying pro tennis, but I was a little lazy.  Had some focus issues.  Moved to Hollywood and just started teaching tennis in Beverly Hills. 
[03:00:00]  Every movie I've ever done is because I've taught tennis to the director.  Wow.  And they just wanted me on the set for tennis lessons on the weekend.  But how do you get clients?  Jesus.  How do you just, like, step into that?  Charming.  Very good.  Some charm.  You pour it on.  Yeah.  And listen, it was easy.  Oh, wow.  I was a good tennis player.  I'm a good teacher.  I'm good with people.  That's why the host is working out, because I'm a good listener.  Did you, you know, stoop any of those broads? 
[03:00:30]  Stop.  I mean, they'd have to pay extra, but yeah, if I have to.  If it'll help their backhand.  Whatever it took to help them win the match.  Right, right.  Did you hear?  You're giving.  Backhanded your balls into it.  I'm trying to think of a tennis sexual thing.  And some type of tennis terminology.  Dude, Dice.  Did you fuck any of your tennis students, Dice?  I never taught no tennis, you asshole.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Not bad.  If I close my eyes and picture the racket, I'd think Dice was swinging it. 
[03:01:00]  Do you still watch tennis?  The U.S. Open just finished up.  I was on the flight yesterday, so I missed it.  Yeah.  I was in the air yesterday as my life was changing.  It is changing.  I left L.A., no one knew me, and when I land here, two people did.  So you're building.  That's not bad.  Yeah, that's good.  And those are the two people on the flight that I was just telling about the test.  That's kind of weird.  Yeah.  While you're in the air, the show's premiering.  Exactly.  Holy fuck.  It was crazy.  So it's got to be an exciting time, man. 
[03:01:30]  Do I not look excited?  Yeah.  I'm excited.  I mean, you look so collected, you know what I mean?  Listen, that's just the suit.  He's trying to wrap his head around the whole thing.  I know.  I know.  His whole life has changed.  Listen, this is the first time I've been outside of three miles in two years.  Yeah.  You're really a homebody, huh?  Yeah.  I just get scared out there.  What kind of apartment do you have?  Basics?  Basic shit?  It's got everything in there I need.  I don't go too extra.  What do you got?  Tell us what you got. 
[03:02:00]  It's a 2003 Honda Civic apartment.  It's hybrid.  Half apartment, half dumpster.  I guess you look totally different without the facial hair.  Do you want me to put it on so we can talk?  Yeah, we should do that.  Look at this guy.  Holy shit.  You know who you look like that?  Tom Skerritt.  Tom Skerritt?  I see Tom Skerritt.  What movie is that from?  That's from The Last Temptation of Kirk Fox.  I was playing Jesus.  You got a...  That's from tennis, anyone, with that beard?  Okay.  Who's the guy from Jesus' son? 
[03:02:30]  And he was in The Watch.  He plays the weird neighbor in The Watch.  Billy Crudup.  You got a little bit of a Billy Crudup vibe.  I'll take it.  That's how we know you.  I miss the handlebars.  You got the handlebar mustache and the hair is thrown around a little bit.  I'm pretty sure that I can get it back.  You have to, right?  You probably get it back.  If I have to.  But you shouldn't judge a man by the hair on his lip.  Need be.  It's what's in his heart.  And I have a hairy ventricle.  Kirk, what is your secret, by the way, to staying as fit as you do? 
[03:03:00]  I've never seen you look even remotely out of shape.  You are like one of the most toned men I've ever seen.  I've weighed 186 pounds since I was five.  I came out tall.  Do you not drink?  It's the same as my IQ.  No, I drink just enough to keep the weight at 186.  Do you not eat poorly?  Do you work out a lot?  What's your deal?  I eat nonstop.  I just have a fast metabolism.  My metabolism is faster than my car, if you want to know.  Well, a car is not really that fast. 
[03:03:30]  Come on.  It can be.  Can it?  If I hook it to something.  Yeah, hook it to a fast car.  I do a lot of drafting.  That's a lot of pictures of me.  There's a lot of pictures of you online.  And if you notice, there's no one else in them.  Why is that?  Because I like selfies.  What's the personal life like?  With regards to what?  Of course, women.  They are out there.  I have one that I spend a lot of time with. 
[03:04:00]  Nice.  There you go.  And it's hard to do.  Nice.  I'd rather be alone, but she forces me.  I take her out occasionally.  Yeah.  I actually went to a Padre Giant game last week with her.  And I threw out the first pitch.  Did you really?  That's nice.  Which was a terrible letdown.  Oh, really?  What happened?  All right.  You know, I wanted the mound.  They didn't give you the mound.  I used to pitch.  Oh, boy.  So in my mind, I was like, I'll throw out such a fastball, they'll just leave me in. 
[03:04:30]  They're going to sign you.  Yeah, right there.  Like, in my mind was, let me just show them what I have.  Sure.  And I did all the training, worked out, steroids for a week.  I mean, I took everything that I was supposed to do.  And then they wouldn't even give me the mound.  They gave me 10 feet in front of the mound.  They gave me a real...  Jesus.  Oh.  They gave me...  These are the things I complain about.  They gave me a lighter ball.  Oh, man.  So I threw it a little hard.  Now I need Tommy John surgery.  Because I only did that. 
[03:05:00]  You're throwing out the first pitch.  Wait, is that true?  They give you a lighter ball?  I don't know if they give everybody, but...  They have to give everyone.  They wouldn't just give it to you.  Here's the best part of this.  Right.  My girl's beautiful.  And she was down on the field with me.  We got there for batting practice.  Every player on the Giants and Padres, I guess since they're in last place and out of the playoff,  they were just hitting on her.  Oh, man.  Relentless.  To the point where they were giving her baseballs, gloves, bats. 
[03:05:30]  I mean, after I threw my first pitch, it looked like she was the trainer.  It was just like...  She was opening a sporting goods store.  I was like, baby, just give that back.  It's like, when a foul ball goes into the stands, the fans just jump on it.  It's the same way when a beautiful girl lands on the field.  The players just dive on it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The best part was...  That's upsetting.  It's humiliating that they put you in front of the mound and give you a lighter ball. 
[03:06:00]  No, but he's Betty White or something.  And I wanted the catcher to be in gear.  I was like, put on some gear, man.  I'm throwing heat.  Let's do this.  And I threw it to him.  He didn't even catch it because he was looking at my girl.  So now it looks like I throw a wild pitch.  And here was the best part.  And I shit you not, we had really great seats, just close enough where the players could  still throw shit to her.  Yes.  And one of the guys that was hitting on her hard came up to bat, smiled at her, hit a 
[03:06:30]  home run.  No.  I'm not kidding.  Wow.  Oh, God.  And she was quite excited about that.  Of course.  Then she noticed his picture on the Jumbotron.  Wow, he's got blue eyes.  And then I finally said, fine, you know, I'll get you the Jumbo dog.  All right?  You can get the big hot dog.  It's like, that's all I can do.  Don't these guys have any fucking respect?  None.  No, they're in last place.  There's no respect. 
[03:07:00]  I think the first baseman actually went out on the field and then realized he'd given his  glove to her.  It's just like, oh.  Can I just use it?  I'll give it back after the game.  I need it.  It was awesome.  And they only gave me a jersey.  I just wanted a cap.  Right.  I mean, where am I going to wear a jersey?  Of course.  Cap over a jersey every time.  So that was me throwing out the first pitch.  I mean.  Is it online somewhere?  I hope not.  Yeah.  Like they said, do you want a picture of this?  I'm like, no.  No.  Why would I want a picture of me standing 10 feet from the mound? 
[03:07:30]  With the wiffle ball, basically.  You're handing the ball to the catcher.  You're handing it to him.  And then the catcher gave the ball to my girl.  It's like, aren't you supposed to at least hand it back to you?  You got to think they're over that whole thing.  They don't want that first pitch crap anymore.  Of course not.  It used to be a special thing, and now they do it at every baseball game.  Because I was from San Diego.  And then they put me in some green room with the lady who was singing the national anthem.  So I didn't know if I was supposed to sit down or stand up the whole time. 
[03:08:00]  Right.  Because I don't know the rules.  Listen, it was a rough day.  That sounds like a very stressful.  Padres, thank you for letting me throw out that first pitch.  Give me the mound next time.  But this is the stuff you got to do because you got the big TV show, The Test.  Hey, listen.  I did what I was supposed to do.  And it was 100 degrees out.  And I was still wearing this suit.  You must have been disappointed.  Were you thinking about how cool it would be on the mound, fucking whipping a ball in there?  I just told you, man.  I planned.  I'd been playing long ball. 
[03:08:30]  I'd been throwing.  You know, I used to pitch.  So I was like, this is my chance.  I mean, I tried out for the Dodgers when I was younger, after college.  Did you really?  But I pulled a hand.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah.  So this was going to be my comeback.  And part of me even wanted to just make a move to first and just, like, throw the ball to empty first base.  And now I wish I did.  Because everyone was like, oh, don't do that.  It'll disrespect them.  Really?  Every player disrespected me.  Yeah, fuck them.  They're all trying to fucking...  Exactly.  Now my girl's, you know, tweeting with the shortstop of the San Francisco Giants. 
[03:09:00]  You're in trouble.  And by the way, you can...  And he's the good-looking one.  He knows who he is.  I bet he's listening.  And you can grow a good pitcher mustache, too.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, but I've got to wait until this show's done.  That could be 10 years.  He's just really tall bras.  Oh, it's...  What's her name?  Oh.  What's her name from MTV?  Oh, that's...  Daisy Fuentes?  Daisy Fuentes.  Oh, is that Fuentes?  That was Daisy Fuentes.  So when girls walk past here, it's basically just like a peep show.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You're looking out of the glass. 
[03:09:30]  We've had some good ones today, too.  But they look in here like they're just looking at a zoo.  Yeah, they don't get it.  Which they are.  Really.  Daisy Fuentes.  They just kept themselves together.  She looks great, huh?  Yeah, she looks really good.  Wow, way.  Statuesque.  If I'd had a baseball glove on me, I would have thrown it to her.  Yeah.  Those fucking sports guys are scumbags, though.  They will just try to fucking...  They're the worst.  They don't even care.  They really are the worst.  She was like chum.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was like chum, and they were sharks.  It was awesome.  I was just...  Oh, the...  I was laughing. 
[03:10:00]  They don't care.  The boyfriends right there...  More of them should get AIDS as a lesson.  Wow.  Not enough of these guys catch it.  You really catch it, Joe.  Wow.  So you go from zero to, like, 1,000.  I was kidding.  Listen, I haven't said much.  Let me just shock the world.  I'm like a sniper.  You know what?  I'm going to take out my commanding officer.  Yeah, yeah.  Frag him.  Yeah.  Shrapnel's my nickname.  Yeah, really, Joe?  What the fuck?  It was a joke.  Right away, everybody's getting fucking fresh. 
[03:10:30]  Well, we're also talking to the guy that Joe...  He punched a car last week.  He's got some problems there.  He might...  Maybe we put you on the test.  Yeah, do you...  No.  What do you got going on that we can test?  Thank you.  I don't really want to get...  Did you not punch a car?  ...punched in the face by a chunky Puerto Rican woman.  It's not something I'm up to doing this week.  So what happened?  Did you just go out of car?  A guy pulled a real asshole move and got out of the car in front of me, just in the lane,  like in front of a supermarket.  So as opposed to hitting him, you thought it'd be easier to take the car out. 
[03:11:00]  No, no, no.  I waited for him to come outside.  Take the car out.  I waited outside for him to come out of the supermarket.  You tell your owner what you did to me, motherfucker.  I waited outside for him and I said...  He waited.  Isn't that...  That is weird.  Well, when you got a lot of free time, you wait.  Most people think about...  Was that a dig?  I think that was a dig.  No, I just meant you're passionate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look, I've been waiting for 40 years for a job. 
[03:11:30]  Joe, most people, they think about waiting, but by the time the guy comes back out, you're  long gone.  You finally go, this is...  Most people go, this is stupid.  Why am I waiting for him when you leave?  But you did not.  He caught me on a bad day.  Okay.  I had just turned...  It was my birthday the week before.  I get in a real funk around my birthday.  I get very angry about being a year older.  It's a lot of life reflection.  Can I ask you what makes you angry?  Do you feel that you didn't do enough that year?  We'll be right back. 
[03:12:00]  No, Gary.  Oh, sorry.  It's a new habit.  Oh, please do.  You know what's funny?  Opie, I'll tell you what's great.  Whenever I'm talking to people now, if it's not going at the pace I like, I just say,  we'll be right back.  And then sometimes I don't come back.  And they're like, what happened?  I'm like, oh, sorry, bro.  You got preempted.  Yeah, yeah.  We moved on.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  No, no.  But Fox is all pissing vinegar with me over here today. 
[03:12:30]  Whoa.  Are you kidding me?  There you go.  This is love, man.  We're back.  We're back.  We're back.  What were you going to say here?  Nothing about you.  Well, that is an anger issue there with the waiting.  Now, if you do something spur of the month, it's the difference between first degree and  second degree.  Spur of the month revolve, really.  Here's the thing.  You were basically lying in wait for that car.  That's creepy.  That's serial killer shit.  Yeah, why am I sitting next to you?  It's not serial killer shit.  How many cars have you taken out? 
[03:13:00]  It's policing other people, which nobody does anymore.  Ted Bundy beat up an Edsel before he killed his first car.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't wait to fucking fight the guy who punched his car.  I waited to be like, dude, do you see what you did here?  Like, why did you do this?  What if you had a gun, Joe DeRosa?  Oh, fucking.  I'm tired of that fucking excuse anymore.  Nobody confronts anybody anymore because we're all so goddamn scared that we might get  shot or we might get fired or we might get sued.  It's ridiculous. 
[03:13:30]  We're not allowed to judge anybody anymore.  We got the trash of the fucking world 24 hours a day on television.  Everybody deserves a voice.  Everybody deserves a fucking stage.  And we don't judge anybody.  Why don't you stop judging people?  On a day-to-day basis, though, when you can't say to somebody...  Describing the test.  No, that's not what I was saying.  I apologize, Kirk Fox.  You have to sit through this today.  No, this was one of the...  I apologize to you.  On a day-to-day...  Suddenly I feel like I'm on the test.  I'm just listening.  But I'm saying on a day-to-day basis, if you can't tell somebody you're being a dick,  which we never do, because God forbid he's got a gun or he's crazy, whatever, you get 
[03:14:00]  fucking pent up, and then one day a guy parks in front of you like that, and you flip the  fuck out.  All right.  You flip the fuck out.  You got a point.  You know what I mean?  I got some intel.  What?  About the mustache.  I got some intel about the mustache.  So, were you done?  And I back you on most of it.  Thank you.  That was just white noise.  You done?  I appreciate that.  I do.  What?  You done?  You good?  It wasn't white noise.  It was an opinion.  It was an opinion.  Don't do the LP thing, because you got a guy that you don't see often. 
[03:14:30]  I love Kirk Fox.  Listen to me.  Hey, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to disrespect you.  Let's fight.  And watch Kirk not get involved.  I'm going to wait outside for you, then.  Make believe he's going to stop the fight.  I'll be waiting downstairs.  Hey, I tried.  I know you tried.  I come at it with heart.  I guess a bat would help.  Tell me about the mustache.  You got intel?  There is intel about the mustache.  Who is producing this show, The Test?  Do you know?  Do I know who my boss is?  It is Jay McGraw. 
[03:15:00]  Is he related to someone named Dr. Phil?  I believe Dr. Phil is his father.  Is his father?  Mm-hmm.  And you believe that there's too many mustaches?  That's the intel.  That's what you think.  The intel is that Dr. Phil's son is producing the show, doesn't want Kirk Fox to take away  from the mustache of his dad.  Because that's kind of a trademark.  That's right.  That is insane.  Yeah, it makes sense.  That's good intel. 
[03:15:30]  Well...  No, I'm not saying it's bad intel.  No, when you say it's intel...  Is that good intel?  There can't be a reason.  Let me see.  There can't be the reason.  You should lock up back hair.  All right.  And then, like, no one else can have back hair.  Bring back the soul patch.  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  It's not coming from CNN.  It's coming from the germ freak.  Okay.  But he's got some cred.  The germ freak's got some cred.  He writes...  I mean, did someone really say this?  The show was produced by Dr. Phil's son.  He was told to shave his mustache so he would not look like Dr. Phil.  You don't look like Dr. Phil.  No way.  Not even close.  You don't have to shave your head.  It's terrific intel. 
[03:16:00]  That's what I'm saying.  That's good intel, right?  Terrific.  I mean, it's funny to me.  I don't believe it's true.  Okay.  That can't be true.  I think we shaved the mustache because I looked a little creepy.  I think it's that fact.  Well, I thought you made up the point of...  I agreed with your thing about the cop thing.  Yeah.  Like, you know, I don't know.  It just...  It looks suspicious or something.  People take me a little more serious without the mustache.  Yeah, no.  It's perfect.  Dude, you...  It's perfect for this gig.  You look like a TV host right now.  You know, the old pictures, you know, you look like you were going to hop in a fucking 
[03:16:30]  El Dorado.  The old pictures, I look like a guest.  Yeah.  Yes.  And now I look like the host.  Now, I think, because you taped the show already, right?  How many episodes did they give you?  We've shot a whole year.  We're still taping, but I've shot...  Oh, you are still taping.  I've shot about 130.  What are you talking about?  Jesus Christ.  I've shot 130 episodes of television.  What?  But we're still filming.  For the test?  Yeah.  This thing's on, baby.  That's insane.  Come on.  That's impossible.  How many do you got to do in a day?  I was doing four shows a day. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, my God.  Three days a week.  You're kidding.  And that's probably why I look like I'm not talking.  I've run out of words.  Jesus Christ.  Wait, so...  So this show's on for a year.  So how many can they show in a year?  130?  We're going to show more.  It's on five days a week.  I'm just like you now.  Wow.  Jesus.  I've got to get a new suit.  Yeah.  What is the...  What happened there that...  What do you want to know? 
[03:17:30]  This is your day.  Get it out.  This is your day.  What was one of the things you had to do on the show that was like...  You were like, wow, that is a fucked up one.  Either lie detector or...  Or DNA test.  That's great.  Where you were like, wow, okay, that's a good one.  I've got to tell you, every story makes you think about everything.  Yeah.  I mean, these...  The people are coming on...  It's a pivotal point.  I mean, marriages are ending.  Oh, man.  Relationships are... 
[03:18:00]  I mean, I'm breaking up families.  Doing the Lord's work.  Or listen, or I'm putting families back together.  Wow.  I mean, it's...  Wow.  You're giving somebody an answer that they need to know.  You're right.  This is real.  I was out of line with that age joke.  You are.  You're raining destruction down.  On fucking married people on this show.  So you go home with a heavy heart, Kirk Fox, because you realize, A, the world is really a fucked up place, and B, you're responsible for some of this shit going down. 
[03:18:30]  No.  Let me tell you why I feel good when I go home.  Okay.  Because I feel that I'm trying to help.  At the end of the day, I'm approaching each story with heart.  It's like I'm not going in there to end it.  If somebody finds out that someone's been cheating on them for 10 years, maybe you shouldn't be married.  If this guy is going to continue to cheat on you, maybe you deserve better.  Tough love.  And if a few punches connect, who are you to say that shouldn't happen? 
[03:19:00]  Listen, I heard Jerry Springer say the same thing once.  Listen, I don't encourage the conflict, Opie.  Of course.  I mean, but it's there.  And I squelch it quick.  I have a strong security team.  We're just fucking around.  No, I know.  I think the show is going to be a hit.  It's going to be a massive hit.  It's going to be, right?  Because you're taking all the elements, the reason why you watch the other shows.  It's got courtroom elements.  It's got War of Jerry. 
[03:19:30]  It's got Heart.  It's got Dr. Phil.  It's got...  Primordial Dwarfs.  Well, you're taking all the shit that happens...  No?  No.  You're taking all the shit that happens after the people on Judge Mathis get home.  Exactly.  And you're putting it on TV.  You're like, fuck the preliminary bullshit.  Let's just get it on TV.  Joe, you nailed it.  Because all the other shows, once you get the answer, the show's over.  Right.  Yep.  On our show, you get the answer.  Now we have a couple more segments.  What are we going to do with the answer?  We have to fix this now.  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  It's not...  We've destroyed it.  Now let's fix it.  The other show...  Well, you're not destroying it.  You're giving someone the truth.  Oh, boy.  And if they're getting the truth, it can only make it better.  You can't handle the truth.  Well, then we have aftercare.  So...  Oh, okay.  What's aftercare?  This is...  What does that consist of?  I mean, I know what it means.  This consists of...  Counseling?  Family counseling, drug treatment.  I mean, I'm putting people in rehab that need it.  I mean, this show has aftercare.  If a guest needs something after the information, if it's too much, I'm giving them aftercare for as long as they need it. 
[03:20:30]  It was invented so the hosts don't go home and hang themselves from all the sadness they see every day.  But I do have tinnitus.  Tinnitus?  My ears have been ringing since this started.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  You're going to need aftercare after the show.  And I hope it stops.  I don't know if it's...  It's just there's been a nice constant ringing.  I'm just waiting for someone to answer it because it's driving me bonkers. 
[03:21:00]  Do you pay for abortions if the woman has...  If she's pregnant and doesn't want to have someone's baby?  Maybe she finds out at somebody's?  Maybe, if she'll do it on the show.  That would be good.  Yeah.  Jesus.  We're being told that you've got to go.  You're doing a lot of press, I guess, huh?  Okay.  So then let me.  Iraq, you've got to go?  Yeah, yeah.  We're just getting started here.  He has to go do Cosmo.  We're just getting...  All right.  Listen, I'll come back and we'll do it again.  Yeah, definitely Kirk Fox.  At Kirk Fox.  That's my...  At Kirk Fox on Twitter. 
[03:21:30]  He's a good one on Twitter.  You know, I like to tweet.  You love this.  You love this.  This is a bromance that's going on between you two.  We hit it off in L.A.  I didn't know him.  He didn't know me.  And we just fucking hit it off.  You guys got a love going on right now.  Why wouldn't we?  You get two guys with this much power, this much raw sexuality.  They got to...  They got to...  Who else are they going to talk to?  Two men.  No one else knows what we go through.  That's right.  Have you seen some of the photos he takes?  Some of the bridge work under some of the tunnels?  This guy's got an eye also.  I've seen everything this guy...  There is a soft, poetic flower inside of that man. 
[03:22:00]  Well, sure.  That he buries.  You got to let it out.  Yeah, but you never water it.  You're trying to kill the guy.  I tried to water this flower for years.  They're fighting for opus.  I know.  That's crazy.  All right, well, listen.  It's kind of nice.  I joined my school.  No, that's not what I was doing.  What do you do to people?  How long did it take for you to get my phone number?  Kirk Fox one day.  What the fuck was your number?  Four or five hours.  Fucking eat me.  He gave me three.  Blow me.  Suck my dick.  You gave me your number right off the bat.  Fuck you.  Jesus. 
[03:22:30]  Fuck you.  What are you, CeeLo?  Holy shit, it sounds like you're about to beat up a car.  I know what you're fucking doing.  I know what you're doing.  The only reason you know is because Bill Burr told you what I'd do.  No.  He gave away my fucking secrets.  I figured it out about...  This is when I knew what you'd do.  I figured it out the third time I was ever in.  The third time I ever did the show, nobody...  Everybody was on.  It was just me and you.  Yeah.  And you were trashing me on the air.  And then I went to break.  I still have to go pee.  And you go, where are you going?  And it looked like...  It looked like a six-year-old that got abandoned at the supermarket. 
[03:23:00]  And I was like, oh, but I'm not going...  Jesus Christ.  I didn't understand where you would be going after that beating.  Oh, my God.  I get it now.  Kirk Fox, we doing hugs today?  Thanks so much, man.  That was very good.  Let's do hugs again.  I like that.  Hey.  It was fun.  While everyone's saying goodbye, I just want to say...  Would you eat a fake apple?  What?  You can stay in my house?  Kirk Fox is going to stay in my house.  Oh.  What about a meatball made the same way?  Oh, sorry.  Like most people, you want to be able to pronounce the ingredients that go into your food, right?  Yes. 
[03:23:30]  If you cook at home, use real fresh ingredients.  If you don't have time to cook from scratch...  Oh, boy.  Mama Mancini's meatballs.  Good job.  That's the answer for you.  Mama Mancini starts with 100% USDA graded domestic beef for their meatballs and all-natural  ingredients, like genuine Pecorino Romano cheese.  Onions, parsley, baked breadcrumbs, eggs, a little salt and pepper.  Real ingredients.  That's it.  Mama Mancini. 
[03:24:00]  They got their famous slow-cooked Italian sauce, too.  It's made just as simple as the meatballs.  They start with whole Italian plum tomatoes, crush them up, and then add natural seasonings.  Mama Mancini's adds meatballs to their simmering slow-cooked sauce for the perfect combination  of flavors.  Since 1921, Mama Mancini's never, never veered from Grandma Mancini's original recipe.  Real ingredients just taste better.  Mama Mancini's slow-cooked Italian sauce and meatballs. 
[03:24:30]  Now available at your local supermarket.  I'm unflappable.  Can't we just eat one?  I know, right?  Bring in some...  Talk about it.  Let's eat one.  Are they coming in?  Maybe next week.  Really?  Monday.  Monday?  Monday.  Oh, man.  I'm in.  Monday.  If you want some extra for home, just let me know.  What happened to the C-Low?  I would.  What happened?  He's doing OutQ and all the other channels.  Yeah.  Well, good for him.  Good for him.  Well, what the fuck are you going to do, you know?  Fuck him.  Some people show no respect.  Fuck him in the ass.  You know what I mean?  Fuck him.  Yeah.  It's, you know, I had your back. 
[03:25:00]  I had your back, guys.  Thanks, Joe.  I had your back.  I turned on fucking C-Low.  Thank you for you.  Good.  Good.  And you were a big C-Low fan.  I was a big C-Low fan.  I turned on a foot.  Well, you should have.  Let's see if Sam has our back.  No, he doesn't.  I'm a big C-Low.  First of all, Joe, you're coming off as a little needy right now, now that Kirk Fox is not  in the room.  Little needy.  What do you mean?  What does Kirk Fox have to do with it?  Because there was a lot of love between Opie and Kirk, and then he leaves, and you're like,  hey, don't forget, guys.  There's no bullshit between me and him.  We're just you and Kirk. 
[03:25:30]  We're just fucking, oh, Jesus Christ.  Just say that when he doesn't have a new TV show.  I don't think that's what it's about.  I think it's about you.  Yeah, we met when we were doing the shitty TV show.  Now he's got a hit TV show.  My problem is...  I knew that show I did with TBS was just average at best, but I met a pal.  My problem is...  I met a new pal.  Yeah, you did.  Whoa!  What happened?  What does it matter?  He looks pretty geeky.  Kirk Fox.  And the pictures online, he doesn't look like that at all. 
[03:26:00]  I thought he looked good.  I think that's as big a change as if he was like a criminal and had to be on the run.  If he did that, he'd so get away with it.  I think so.  He's like, oh boy, he's very different for this gig.  Now, do you miss his mustache?  Aw.  I miss the mustache.  He's one of the only guys that can pull off a mustache.  You like him more rugged?  Yeah.  I like him a little more rugged.  Yeah, the mustache is rugged.  A little five o'clock shadow action.  Oh yeah.  I just learned something today. 
[03:26:30]  You didn't mind to tickle the mustache on your upper lip?  Oh boy.  He really wants to go down this road.  He's implying...  Does he really want to go down this road?  He's saying you kiss boys.  If I could say...  Does he really want to go down this road?  I do.  He's implying...  You've got a lot of history, sir.  You've got a lot of history.  That day, kissed.  Look, I know I want to suck a girl's dick.  You know, that's...  I'm at terms with it.  I'm at terms with it.  I also realize that nothing is nailed down in this place.  Look at the...  I almost...  Oh shit.  Jesus.  They don't even nail the shit down in here.  It's fucking ridiculous.  It's like a Kia.  What the fuck do you got to do to have a goddamn... 
[03:27:00]  I don't know.  Good studio?  Goddamn nailed down studio.  All right.  So we got to go home.  I got to...  Yeah, we got to get.  And then...  You got another gig?  You're going to be fine.  Oh, you'll be right here with Sam Roberts.  I got...  I got you good.  In the capable hands of Sam Roberts.  I know.  I got you, Joe.  Look, I look forward to it.  I got to go.  I got a home visit today.  What's that mean?  Home visit.  I don't know.  Oh, a home...  What is a home visit?  Like a home invasion?  My kid is starting school.  He's barely three.  He's a little over three, and they have a home visit before he starts his schooling. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah.  Dude, it is so...  That's what...  Thank you, Joe.  Fucking intrusive anymore.  Yes.  Yes.  It is ridiculous.  First of all, we didn't start school until five.  They're like, why is he starting at three?  I'm like, because that's what they do now.  What?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  Preschool, right?  He'll be like three and a half by the time.  What do they got to go to your house for?  I don't know.  It's not in their business, quite frankly.  One of the teachers is coming over and checking out our house for 15 minutes.  What the fuck is that about? 
[03:28:00]  So they got to make sure you're the right type of people.  No, he's already in.  We had to apply.  No, so if the kids...  Donations.  And I'm not a...  And we didn't apply for some fancy...  This was regular schooling.  You have to apply in Manhattan.  Yeah, it's to lay the land to your house, so if the kid comes in fucked up, they know what  you're doing at home.  Exactly.  Seriously.  That's exactly it.  They'll write some shit down.  They probably have it all on the scale.  Like, okay, that's a two.  This is a four.  Who is a three?  They put it in a computer and you fucking spits out some fucking profile on your kid. 
[03:28:30]  Like, you know what the fuck those teachers are going to do.  Who are they to judge you?  It should be the other way around.  We should go to their house and see if there's a bong laying around.  Because they'll be in school and be like, okay, we know we can put this kid in a group.  Right.  But this kid here, we went to his house.  Oh my god, he's a fucking animal.  We gotta keep him.  We gotta keep him away.  Like, they know, based on what they see in the house, how they can treat the kid at  the school.  I love the jokes, Ann, because they're terrific, but what is this really about?  It is all elaborate. 
[03:29:00]  It's just a more elaborate way for them to continue to pass the buck and take zero responsibility  for the services you pay for and that they provide.  That's all it is.  They want to have a fucking record, so if anything goes wrong, they can blame it on you.  It's not their fucking fault.  You know when you take your vehicle into a parking garage and they do the walk around?  Yeah.  See if there's any dings in it?  Yeah.  Things like that.  They want to see if your kid's dinged up first.  Yeah.  You want to guess how much it's going to cost to send my kid to school at three and four  months old?  Oh my god.  $15 to $20. 
[03:29:30]  Dollars, I would hope.  Nothing.  How much?  $20.  $20 a year.  $20 a year.  What?  Is it private school?  $20 a year.  Manhattan, because the public school system is really fucked up.  $20 a year.  You know, you got those people that are also going to go to school with your kid.  Two hands of blackjack.  That everyone goes to other schools.  What do you mean?  Those people.  You know.  What do you mean by that?  Just those people.  You want to keep the kids away from the riffraff, is what it is.  And now it costs you $20,000.  No, in Manhattan.  Keep your kid away from riffraff.  But in Manhattan, everyone has to... 
[03:30:00]  Most...  The majority of people living in Manhattan pick their school.  It's unbelievable.  And guess what?  I got off cheap.  $20,000 for a three-year-old to go to school?  I got off cheap.  What's he going to learn?  That's fucking ridiculous.  How much are crayons?  They go up to $75 to $100.  Yeah.  Right?  They go up to $75 to $100.  $100,000 for a three-year-old.  $100,000.  $100,000.  Yes.  Buying some arts and crafts.  Those are the top hoity-toity, let's put our kid in a, you know, suit and tie and shit. 
[03:30:30]  Get some popsicle sticks.  I got off easy.  Get some crayons.  Get some macaroni.  Get some glue.  You'll be fine.  Yeah.  I got off easy.  Yeah.  You know that was like you telling me that information was literally the realization that  I'm never going to have a family?  Yeah.  As soon as you just said that, I was like, oh, I'll never have a family.  I don't know if I would ever be able to afford an additional $20,000 a year.  Oh, just don't live in a city.  Joe, I got two kids.  I got two for work.  I got two kids.  I got two trains.  Yeah.  Fast forward a couple years, I'm going to be up to 40 G's a year just for that. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  But you got money.  Maybe that 20-year fund will run out a little quicker than we thought.  Maybe it'll run out.  You came in here with a lot of fucking piss and vinegar, brother.  A lot of piss and vinegar in the studio today.  Don't take my line about Kirk Fox.  He was coming at me.  He was getting a little smart over there.  He was feeling the Opie love.  That's what fucking...  And he started taking it out on me.  I didn't like when he said, I'm not going to say anything, and then I'm an assassin.  I was being courteous to the guest.  I was being quiet.  I got to tell you, there's a little jealousy from DeRosa to Kirk. 
[03:31:30]  He won't admit it, but I feel it, too.  A little bit.  By the way, Opie, that's what our own Roland said you marinated the steak in.  Piss and vinegar.  You son of a...  That's what it was infused.  Really?  I wish.  It was infused the way.  I wish.  I wish.  Joe, you want to hear angry.  Listen to the first hour of today's show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Opie was not a happy boy starting today.  About what?  And that's why I did the CeeLo thing.  I put the dick back in your ass, brother.  We could bring him into the studio.  He chose how to cook a steak properly.  Whoa. 
[03:32:00]  When did Opie cook steak?  Over the weekend.  Over the weekend.  I mean, were you surprised that he didn't know how to cook a steak?  Nothing about Opie says joke.  Joey D taking shots.  There's a slam.  Wow.  Joey D.  Joey D and his shots.  You motherfucker.  Come on.  We're having fun here.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  That's how you want a bit to end.  Come on.  We're having fun here.  We're having fun.  Yuck.  What did you do to the steak, dude? 
[03:32:30]  It wasn't even that bad.  I fucking moved it around some barbecue sauce, threw it on a grill.  Oh.  A barbecue sauce.  Oh, look, look, look.  See?  Roland said he marinated it.  Roland, you weren't outside.  I know, but the steak told me, though, when I looked at it, I think, ah, it's been flipped  too many times.  He soaked it in barbecue sauce and then put it on the grill.  You never soaked a steak in barbecue sauce?  And then it was undercooked and then overcooked.  And then it was undercooked.  And then he flipped it too many times.  And then it was overcooked and dried.  Because these assholes need all their shit infused with something. 
[03:33:00]  Yes?  Now, this is what you need to do.  Oh.  You want to know how to cook a steak?  I'm going to tell you the best recipe you can get.  Oh, boy.  Here's what you do.  Seriously.  You rub it in olive oil, some kind of oil.  I didn't have any rub.  All right.  It's the end of the season.  I don't have much left in the house.  Oil.  Just oil.  We're packing up.  Get in the hell out.  Rub the steak with some oil.  Okay?  That's it.  No, that's mobile.  I try to eat healthy.  All right.  I'm not rubbing anything in oil.  Then skip the oil part.  You can skip the oil.  I should have rubbed their shit in oil.  They probably would have been happy.  Here's what you do. 
[03:33:30]  Yes, sir.  That's the mistake I made.  Skip the oil step.  Infused.  You salt.  You cut some slits in it.  I don't salt my food.  Salt the shit out of both sides of it.  Let it sit for 10 minutes.  I'm trying to have a heart attack.  Just shut up.  He's not trying to have a heart attack.  Let the salt sit on both sides for about 10 minutes.  It eats into the food.  It brings the flavor out in the meat.  It will not taste salty enough.  And it also brings up your high blood pressure.  You're not trying to salt this food right now, Joe.  Hit it with a little pepper and a little garlic in that shaker.  You put the garlic in the little slits.  Yeah, 500 degrees.  Infused.  Sear it on each side. 
[03:34:00]  Turn down the volume.  Turn down the heat and let it cook through a little bit.  That's all good if you want to eat like a slob.  No.  Slob, really?  Barbecue sauce on steak?  Better than oil and salt.  You put ketchup on your baked potatoes, too?  Oh.  Oh.  Joey D taking shots.  I'll tell you what I like.  What?  A little virgin olive oil.  You just put enough on there to glaze it.  That's what I'm saying.  Then you take a lot of that peppery spices and stuff and you cram it on there and you rub it all in there nice. 
[03:34:30]  And then you throw it on that grill and, by God, don't you fucking make the middle of that goddamn thing any less than pinkish red.  And that's, you slice it.  Oh, butter, motherfucker.  I'm telling you something.  You don't need all the spices.  I love the spices.  I'm telling you.  I'm not cutting it and putting salt in it like I'm trying to remove a fucking leech.  Just hear what I'm saying. 
[03:35:00]  It's with me.  We try to eat healthy.  Salt besides pepper and garlic, that's all you need out of those spices.  I'm telling you.  I don't like that salt idea.  Thank you, man.  That's frightening me.  It's how they do it in the stink houses.  It doesn't disappear.  You're getting a high sodium content.  No, it eats into the meat.  Where does the sodium go?  It disappears?  What do you think's in that rub that you love so much?  You know how high in sodium that shit is?  It's the same thing.  That's what rub you get.  That's right.  You get a peppery rub.  What do you use, a Montreal seasoning?  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:35:30]  Some adobo seasoning.  I'm sorry, Iron Chef.  This asshole's like you.  You're fucking mummifying your steak.  Put salt in it.  I'm telling you.  Leave the organs in a jar by the barbecue so it can take it up to heaven with it.  What are you doing?  Yeah, this guy doesn't think the salt's...  Wrap it in gauze.  This guy thinks that the salt's still not in there.  It's not in there.  Yeah, where does it go?  Where does it go, Joe?  It brings out the flavor.  It brings out the flavor because the salt's still in it.  It's the same amount of salt that you're getting in that rub. 
[03:36:00]  He goes, oh, now that he salted me, I'm going to allow it to feel some of my flavor.  Or cutting slices, filling them up with salt.  The meat absorbs the salt.  You're right, guys.  That's because Joe's by nature.  Joe just likes rubbing salt into wounds.  So he cuts the fucking steak and rubs it in it.  And then make sure you give it a good helping of fucking insults.  I resent these comments.  You punch in a few cards like I...  You punch your steak like you punch cars.  From some fucking cop that shows up at your barbecues. 
[03:36:30]  Hey, whoever cooks.  I learned from a chef.  A chef told me this recipe.  A fucking chef told me this recipe.  Hey!  You're going to cook my tube steak in your mouth, you lord.  You do realize salt dissolves, right?  So it's still there.  The Himalayan salt's really good.  You're missing the point of the salt thing.  I'm not...  For you, I understand, Opie, because you're saying I don't put salt on the food, period.  Right.  Anthony is going...  I like to rub the...  He's making a face like it's his load going into tits. 
[03:37:00]  It's a good fucking...  But I like a spicy rub.  Not...  It's not all salt.  Right.  It's not...  I'm telling you, it's not all salt.  You salt both sides.  There's no salt and pepper.  The salt eats in.  Then you hit it hard with crushed ground pepper.  You hit it hard.  You hear this?  Garlic.  And maybe a little paprika if you want a little spice to it.  Do you hit it hard?  Paprika.  Huh?  Do you?  Do you wait for the steak to come out of the store before you hit it hard?  Yeah, yeah.  Is it in the car that you're hitting?  It's in the car.  You hit it hard.  Like, ugh, that's douchey. 
[03:37:30]  You hit it hard.  Who says hit it hard and then you hit it hard?  Is it?  Here's the question.  You put a steak in barbecue sauce.  I loved it.  Oh, man.  What are you making?  I loved it.  A fucking Burger King sandwich of the month?  Trying to make his own McRib.  Joe, here's the question, though.  Right.  Right.  Now, you got two guys that I think Ant tries to eat healthy in general.  For the most part.  Okay.  You know, at barbecues.  So the whole oil and the salt that magically disappears and hitting it hard with other shit 
[03:38:00]  that's bad for you.  Pepper's not bad for you.  All right, but hear me out.  Right.  That's all good, but if you don't want to eat shitty, then how do you cook a steak properly  that is, obviously, eating red meat in general is not the greatest thing, but you can cut  down the calories if you do it right.  I hear what you're saying.  How much salt do you think I'm talking about?  I'm not saying fucking dip the thing in rock salt.  I'm saying the amount of salt that is in this rub he's talking about is the same amount  of salt I'm talking about. 
[03:38:30]  Salt, then I'd rather just do the rub than the salt.  But I'm alleviating all these other things.  But you hit it hard with the rub, or you just kind of sprinkle it on?  I'm hitting it hard.  And then you hit it hard with some rub.  Wow, he really didn't like that, Joe.  You know what?  You know what I didn't like?  The last one was at Anthony's house, and I almost got salmonella from the bloody chicken  from the fucking traffic cop that he let cook us all food with.  So, I'm sorry if my recipes aren't up to par, Ian.  Believe me, with all we were drinking, salmonella had not a chance. 
[03:39:00]  I had a friend, Freddy.  He's been, I don't know, I talk about him every once in a while.  He used to butter his steaks before he cooked them.  Oh boy, yeah.  I've seen people do that.  That's fucking nuts.  I don't butter.  I've never buttered the steak, but I have used butter as the lube if I have to pan fry it.  I've used a little butter.  Dude, a little butter ain't gonna kill you.  You can't soak it in the shit.  But a little coating just to help get that sear on, it's nothing, dude. 
[03:39:30]  I remember how my mom used to cook fucking chicken in the broiler with just butter.  No, it was fucking butter.  And it would sit in a pool of butter.  And then every, like, five minutes, she'd open up the oven and then take a baster and  just put the butter all over it.  But let me tell you something.  The fucking skin of the chicken would come out.  It was a golden treat to be enjoyed. 
[03:40:00]  Dude, that's great.  My aunt gave me a ham recipe one year because I was having friends over at Christmas or something.  I was like, I'm gonna make a fucking ham and we're gonna get drunk and eat it.  And where you put clove, you, you, like, quarter the fucking back of the ham, you know,  where you cut the, like, tic-tac-toe thing.  We're trading recipes here on the Open Anthony Show.  You put a clove in each one of the little squares.  And she goes, and then you, she goes, put it in a pool of orange juice.  What?  And then bake it.  And she goes, every 15 minutes, baste it with the orange juice. 
[03:40:30]  Dude, this fucking ham.  Was it great?  It was amazing.  It was amazing.  All the sugar in that juice and the citrus flavor.  Oh, my God.  Do you approve?  Yeah, that's Rachel Ray's.  Oh, it's Rachel Ray's?  Mm-hmm.  But see, I'm not stupid.  I know how to make things.  She's got hams for her ass.  I want to spread our ham hocks apart and eat a chocolate goo hole.  I know how to make things taste good.  But the problem I struggle with is trying to eat healthy. 
[03:41:00]  Look, if you don't use salt at all, you're in a tough spot.  Very low.  This guy's gonna explain the salt thing with steak.  Go ahead, Steve.  Hey, what's going on?  And please don't use the term, hit it hard.  Then you gotta hit it hard.  I would not hit it hard.  Okay.  You put the salt on the outside of the steak brings moisture out of the steak, so it intensifies  the flavor of the steak.  And it also brings out some of the proteins from the steak.  So when you sear it, it gets a better sear and more flavor on the outside of the steak. 
[03:41:30]  Salt, a lot of times, in cooking is used for the chemical reaction.  Wow.  All right.  There you go.  There's a real answer.  Oh, that's amazing, Steve.  Well, you had the salt magically disappear.  Oh, my God.  No.  No.  Steve.  Steve.  He's right about that.  Steve.  Isn't it nice when people actually let you finish your sentence, how you get the whole  explanation out?  Oh, wow.  I was trying to say that ten minutes ago.  I got as far as the salt eats in, and all you focused on was, what is it, a fucking magic 
[03:42:00]  trick?  What is it, disappear?  I would have fucking said every word that guy just said if you let me get the goddamn  sentence out of my face.  Next time, I'll come in in a suit with glasses on, and then maybe you'll let me talk.  I told you.  I told you.  Too bad I'm not a car, because then you could punch me.  You're hitting me with my soft psycho spot.  You're right.  It was a fucking crazy thing to do, I fully admit it.  That was crazy.  My mom told me I made her sick to her stomach.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  That was crazy to do.  I know. 
[03:42:30]  That guy was coming for you.  I thought of all people, you would have backed me, you fucking lunatic.  No, I don't like getting into fucking brawls like that with fucking crazy people.  I punched the subway token booth once.  I understand, but I just can't do that shit anymore.  I can't do it.  Look, I shouldn't have done it.  I had no intention of doing that.  I just can't do that shit.  I thought he was going to come out.  I was going to go, dude, what the fuck, man?  And I wasn't a dick when he came out.  Like, at that point, you got to understand, you're going to probably have to fight now. 
[03:43:00]  I didn't, when he first came out, I didn't go up to him like, hey, fuck you, man.  I went up to him like, I go, dude, why would you park here, man?  I go, you block this whole lane.  Everybody's got to pull into the opposing lane.  There's kids everywhere.  Your car's blocking the little kids.  I go, dude, are you going to cause an accident, man?  And he was just such...  He's like Syria, not my problem.  Yeah, he literally was like, fuck, and he was like laughing.  Dude, how much do you see red when you tell somebody, like, dude, come on?  Oh, my God, he starts laughing at you.  Yeah, it's like, and I freaked out.  What do you expect a guy to do? 
[03:43:30]  Go, oh, wow, I see you.  Sorry.  I see it your way.  Sorry, dude, I fucked up.  Sorry.  Because you're too aggressive.  Yeah, yeah, laugh.  Laugh like I laughed when I saw your mother's huge fucking cunt last night.  And I'll get him.  Yeah, it's an expert.  He's an expert.  Yeah.  Because you're not going to have the guy see it your way ever.  No, no, never.  I was in the movies yesterday.  You want him to.  You've got to hit it hard.  You've got to hit it hard.  You do.  I was in the movies yesterday.  You've got to infuse your fist into the side of his car.  This fucking broad in the movies behind me, she's talking. 
[03:44:00]  Top of her fucking lungs.  Top of her fucking lungs, right?  Her daughter keeps going, shh, shh, shh.  She won't shut up.  She won't shut up.  She keeps talking.  Finally, I go, shh.  She starts laughing like, oh, shit, I got in trouble, right?  It's like, Jesus, just stop talking.  What the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  She keeps talking.  Her daughter shushes her again.  She goes, don't you shush me.  Don't you shush me.  Don't you tell me to shut up.  And her daughter goes, shut up.  Like that.  And the lady starts going.  And I turn around and I go, lady, shut up. 
[03:44:30]  Nice.  Fuck.  And then she, this is literally what she does.  She goes, don't you tell me to shut up neither.  It's a movie.  I can talk.  No.  And it's like, dude.  We're civilized here.  This fucking society is so overrun with assholes now that people, and it's so unpoliced, once  again.  I don't mean police police.  I mean us calling each other on our shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what you tell that fucking bitch?  You turn around and you go, shut the fuck up before I fuckstart your daughter's head.  That's how you do it. 
[03:45:00]  See, he's got a ball.  That's how you do it.  That's the fucking, did you ever see The Way of the Gun?  Oh, it's the best thing.  That seems great.  I fuckstart your girlfriend.  Yeah.  Tell her to shut the fuck up before I fuckstart that cunt's head.  Yeah.  And it's Sarah Silver and she goes, you motherfucker.  And he just punches her right in the face.  Oh, what a great scene that is.  That kind of asshole behavior has gone on for so long that people think that's just the  way it goes.  They're like, no, you just talk at movies.  That's how it goes.  That's the new norm.  Yeah, you just fucking talk at movies.  We're looking at the new Charles Bronson in studio. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, that's right.  I got a death wish.  It's called Too Much Salt on My Stam.  That's Joe Kersey.  You're going to go at it hard.  You're going to go at it hard with these issues?  I'm going to go at it hard.  I'm done playing games.  Joe DeRosa going at it hard.  Every time someone cleans up the scum in this town.  I'm cleaning up these streets, starting with people that talk at movie theaters and then  on to people that park illegally.  I'm going after the big offenders.  Yes, you should.  Next, it'll be bike lanes. 
[03:46:00]  I'm with you there.  All right, Joe, what's the CD called?  War Paint.  It's called Fuck Off.  Oh, man.  That was so uncalled for.  Fucking A, right, Joe?  It was.  These guys, they love female comics.  Who's these guys?  You.  What, because I had a female comic on the air?  Huh?  You've had a lot of female comics on your show.  Yeah, you do.  You really light up when a cute girl comes into the room, don't you?  Oh, God forbid a guy lights up when a cute girl comes into the room.  Oh, and I'm listening to the room.  Because she didn't have a dick. 
[03:46:30]  Sorry, he doesn't have a cock.  Sammy does, though.  Sammy gets real fucking chatted.  He chats it up with the girls.  He does.  I chat it up with everybody.  I'm a chatty guy.  You can always tell a guy that never got laid, because a cute chick comes in the room, and  he's like, huh, huh, studs.  Geez, damn lady.  We were all the studs that you were in high school.  You know, if you don't got laid a lot in high school, guys who punch car windows because  they're so mad.  Oh, wow.  A little sexual energy coming out there, Joe.  Listen, he probably didn't have a lot of frustration in high school. 
[03:47:00]  A lot of chicks love a guy that punches a car.  It's dangerous.  It makes them all fucking nervous.  They love it.  It's a bad boy tactic, and it's worked for me for years.  I punch stuff in front of girls all the time.  They love it.  Listen, my new CD.  Oh, yes.  It's not called Warp Paint.  It's called You Will Die.  It's online right now.  Please download it, and I'll be selling it at my shows, the next of which are in Syracuse 
[03:47:30]  this weekend at the Funny Bones, starting Thursday.  Thank you.  Hey, Syracuse, you should come on my show.  Oh, that's right.  I don't have a show.  Who's that?  Scorch.  Syracuse legend.  Is that the radio?  I've never been up there.  Is that the radio show up there?  Well, it was.  Scorch was one of the guys.  Before he moved to Manchester.  And then got fired.  And then got fired from...  Man Vegas?  Manch Vegas.  Manch Vegas.  Manch Vegas.  How's that sea level?  Yeah.  Are you going through the picks? 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, you got to go through the picks.  Da-da-da-da.  Fuck you.  What are the picks of?  Cee-lo.  Cee-lo.  He's small.  He kind of looks like Al Roker.  Yeah.  It's racist.  It is.  Why?  I don't know.  I just mean because of the bald thing.  Something people say when a white person addresses anything having to do with a black person.  You got to say, well, that's racist.  They don't.  Oh.  They don't know. 
[03:48:30]  Ah, never mind.  You guys are trying to wrap up.  I got to add something to tell you.  Is it good?  It's very good.  For you?  Yeah.  Us?  It's good, yeah.  For us too?  I found out I'm not white.  What?  At all.  Wait, what are you?  I did a DNA test on Ancestry.com.  No, you didn't.  I found out I'm not Italian or Egyptian.  Wait, wait, wait.  I brought this up earlier.  How do you do a DNA test?  Wait, you're not Egyptian after all these years of abuse?  I found out, yeah.  I found out like two weeks ago.  Which one?  How do you do a DNA test on mine?  They send you a kit and you fill this tube up with saliva and they do it. 
[03:49:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Why did your adopted parents say you were Egyptian for all these years?  Because the agency said to my parents, the parents were from Egypt and Italy.  But I think my mom maybe mistook that as they are Egyptian and Italian, but they were not.  They might have just been from those countries.  So you could be the lightest skinned black in America.  I have 10% black in me.  All right.  Huh?  Dumb.  You know what I'm saying.  One drop rule.  I actually like that.  One drop rule. 
[03:49:30]  You can't hang out with Anthony anymore.  That's about it.  Bye, Joe.  10% black.  That's too high.  You cut sucker.  Would you love me any less?  Wait, what are you?  Nah.  What are you kidding?  What are you?  They break it down into regions.  They can't say to you, like, you're specifically this.  They can tell you regions.  So 10% was East African, which was like Ethiopia.  Oh, my God.  That area.  That's black.  The other, there was 18% North African, which did not include Egypt. 
[03:50:00]  It was like Morocco and those areas.  Holy shit.  Then the rest was Middle Eastern.  72% Middle Eastern.  Northern, like Iraq, Saudi Arabian, like that whole area.  Holy shit.  Sleeper cell.  What a shithole.  Yeah, I know.  In the middle of a petri dish.  We've been talking about it a lot on stage.  Wow.  Your DNA is a conflict.  Huh?  Yes.  Your DNA is a conflict.  Well, here's the funny part.  I'm doing a bit about this.  It's like, I have a whole fucking thing on my new album about how much I hated being Italian 
[03:50:30]  and how much I hate Italian Americans.  I just shit on it relentlessly.  Right.  It's like, I thought they were my people.  Now I just have 10 minutes of horrifically racist shit on my CD.  Anti-Italian shit.  Yeah.  It's fucking ridiculous.  I talk about how I don't give a fuck about Egypt and the whole justification is like,  I'm Egyptian.  Wow.  And it's like, no, no, no, no, you're not.  All that North African shit and not one Egyptian fucking piece of you.  They get a lot of that North Africa.  Believe it or not, though, the North African region did not cover, at least in my bloodline, 
[03:51:00]  did not cover Egypt.  The Middle Eastern portion slightly just grazes Egypt.  So I'm like, I guess there's a tiny chance I could be from that one little fucking, but  come on, what are the chances?  Isn't it fucked up that 10% of your genes are responsible for 90% of the crime in your  body?  Come on, Ann, I'm one of the good ones.  Yeah.  You held that info back until 1030?  I wasn't even holding it back. 
[03:51:30]  I just didn't think of it for some reason until you made the black comment.  Are you going to get along better with Keith Robinson now?  Oh, Keith is reveling in it.  Is he?  He's like, I like it.  You know better than any of us.  Is he calling you a nigga?  Uh, he has called me that word with the hard R on it.  Oh, yeah.  He has?  Yeah.  Wow.  I thought he'd be more like, you know, a bro and, you know, a homeboy.  He's fucking thrilled.  Yeah.  He's fucking thrilled.  Really?  Yeah.  I made some gay joke to him the other day, and he goes, so what? 
[03:52:00]  What are you, a homophobe?  And I go, that is the first quality of your people that I adopted, was extreme homophobia.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Well, congratulations.  Yeah.  So, uh, you can find me at Ant's Next Barbecue.  I'll be serving everybody.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Hey.  Boy.  Please, come here.  Ha, ha, ha.  That's great.  Cool, man.  Yeah, whatever.  What are you going to do?  It's exotic. 
[03:52:30]  Now we understand the anger.  Come on.  Slap me five.  Now we understand the anger.  Slap me five.  Nigga side.  I turned my hand off.  What was that?  What does that mean?  That's the old days.  What does that mean?  As you were a kid, you would hold your hands out, right?  And you'd go, yes, give me five.  Nigga side.  And you'd turn your hand, because black people had the white palms.  Everyone looked white this way.  But then the black tops of the skin, of the hand.  So you'd go, slap me five, and then you'd turn your hand over.  Look at Rollins.  That was what we said in Racist Long Island growing up, as kids. 
[03:53:00]  We didn't know any better.  I have a feeling you would have said that anywhere you were born.  We didn't know any better.  We didn't know any better, Roland.  That came with his birth certificate.  And it's really changed now that you do know better.  It was, you know, what the kids did in the neighborhood.  And that's how you also said, eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  There was no tiger.  You would catch him by the toe.  Oh, yeah.  And that's in Pulp Fiction when he says that.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:53:30]  And then when there's a fight, a black person and a white person were fighting.  You'd say, fight, fight, nigger in a white.  That was like what you would chant.  There was a lot of rape.  Wow.  As a kid, man.  If the white doesn't win, we all jump in.  Both races say that, but they flip it.  Yeah, we never said that one.  We just were like, oh, fight, you know, stuff like that.  You never had the second part of that?  No, no, no.  We had the second part in the hardcore town of Senneport, Long Island.  Maybe if we knew that second part, we wouldn't get our asses kicked constantly.  No, you needed the second part. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, we all jump in.  Oh.  That's how that ends.  No, I just thought it was, you know.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  And you were the next town over.  What happened?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  All right, Joe.  Joe.  It's been a pleasure.  My homeboy.  We stayed late for you, because you've got CDs to say.  You know what?  Roland likes to slap me five.  He's crying.  That's hilarious.  He really enjoys that you trick the person. 
[03:54:30]  Yes, yes.  The trickery of turning your hand over.  He does like a good trickery.  I had a lovely time with you guys today.  It was fun, man.  Good seeing you again.  Great to see the both of you.  Does CeeLo even know that we blew him off?  Nah, I don't think so.  He doesn't even have an idea, right?  Nope.  No, just go this way.  Well, that worked well.  Yeah, it's not going to affect him whatsoever.  That sucks.  Yep, you're not going to ruin his day.  I wanted it to hurt a little.  Nope.  Well, he probably didn't hear about it, though.  He didn't even know he was going to do this show, so it's like it never happened to begin with. 
[03:55:00]  Who cares?  Oh.  Yeah.  If a guest booking gets canceled in the woods, then no one's there to...  Exactly right.  Something like that, right?  Something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, nice.  We won't get fooled again.  I like that.  All right.  How weird is this?  Tim Sabian comes aboard.  We even go late now on the radio.  It's crazy.  You're going to credit that to Tim Sabian?  Yeah, not the Radio Wizard.  So how about all the early days when you kind of got out of here early?  Whose fault?  We never leave early.  Never?  Not really.  We usually make it. 
[03:55:30]  If we leave right at 10, you know, that's not early.  Right.  We usually make it to 10, at least.  Whose fault was it that you started saying 10 o'clock on the dot, out of here?  Radio Wizard.  Uh-huh.  That's too bad.  There's now counting beans somewhere.  What'd you guys get?  A new boss?  Yep.  A guy we used to work with.  Oh, that's cool.  He's good.  That's great.  Let's see what happens.  We're in transition, though, right now, so we really are boss-less.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's, like, coming in.  He's not in place yet.  Yeah, yeah.  He's here, but he's-  Gotta get all the logistics in place, you know. 
[03:56:00]  He's just taking a look.  So right now, we just kind of-  Just taking a look around.  Oh.  Yeah.  And this was the guy from back in the XM days?  No.  God, I wish Logan was back.  Back in the syndication days.  Eric Logan is never coming back.  He's never coming back to me.  He was with Ofra.  He went from working with us to Ofra.  Ofra Winfrey.  Ofra Winfrey.  Now, that's a funny pronunciation of Oprah.  Yeah.  That's what you're saying.  Yes, yes.  Okay.  Now I got you.  People used to actually call her Ofra.  I see.  I didn't go at it hard enough. 
[03:56:30]  I get it.  You just gave me the fucking dirtiest look.  It was the look of disgust on your face.  I realized I quickly changed.  You notice I went back to normal?  Yeah, it was disdain.  It was disdain.  It was pure disdain.  So he went to Oprah.  Yep.  Jesus.  Talk about going from say whatever you want to keep your fucking mouth shut.  Fucking yap shut.  Jesus Christ.  Is that unbelievable?  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  That is a one under the spectrum to other. 
[03:57:00]  Huh?  Got rid of his bloated alcoholic face.  Looks about 10 years younger.  That's great.  I wouldn't be surprised if she had contractual shit where it's like, you work for me, you  don't fucking drink.  Seriously.  No, she drinks.  I watched enough of the Ofra.  They did a little reality show and she had some drinks in the back office constantly.  Really?  The Ofra likes her drinks.  Oh, was it like a faggy fucking, you know, glass of wine kind of a thing? 
[03:57:30]  I mean, no.  That's real.  I forgot what it was.  It was not tossing back Yeager shots or anything.  Yeah, but Eric Logan cleaned up his act.  Lost a lot of weight.  Looks great.  That's all right.  Remember the music?  That's all right.  Sorry.  Oh, we ate up Sam's after show.  Sorry.  Look, I don't care.  You kind of do.  Yeah, you do.  Wait, look.  Did I miss talking to Joe DeRosa?  There's always tomorrow.  I got to talk to him right here.  Sam, go fuck yourself, you little weasel.  You're so angry.  He hung up on you the other day. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah, he's such a weasel.  I'm in the airport.  They call me and I'm like, yeah, what's up?  And they go, we want you to go in the airport.  I'm like, okay.  Stop using pronouns.  You and E-Rock.  We both called you.  E-Rock called me and his words were, Sam wants you to come on.  That's what his words were.  He was lying to you.  Now, which one of you is lying?  Who knows?  Because it's literally like talking to the devil.  You just deal in lies.  Anyway, so he goes, they want you to go on.  I go, okay, fine.  I'm sitting there eating breakfast.  They put me on.  He goes, Eliza Slesinger on the phone. 
[03:58:30]  I go, hey.  She goes, oh, Joe, I wanted to make a joke on Twitter how I took you out of the number  one spot on iTunes.  I go, oh, yeah, that's funny, Eliza.  Actually, I wanted to make a joke to you.  And she goes, I was afraid you'd get offended.  I don't know you.  Well, I go, I don't care.  War payment's funny.  No problem.  And then he just hangs up on me.  And I'm like, the hang up didn't even make sense.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like you hang up on somebody when they're telling a story.  No, you hang up on somebody when you don't need to talk to them.  I don't know why.  Then what'd you ask me to come on for?  I didn't.  I don't know why Eric put you on.  Oh, bullshit, Sam.  I mean, is this what we would have heard for 45 minutes? 
[03:59:00]  No, no.  I just, they're just, they're just, they're little trick games.  You don't got to sell us on it, Joe.  We deal with little, like, nymphs and trolls games.  You know, like, they're always dancing around with their little games.  A lot of trickery.  I don't know what games you're talking about.  I just told you what happened.  It was cute.  You were trying to be, like, a real radio guy.  And it was adorable.  Yeah, all right.  You have fun in Syracuse.  You pretend you're a real comic.  Oh!  All right.  I will.  It'll be fun.  Last time somebody brought up your comic aptitude, you said they were fucking with your livelihood. 
[03:59:30]  Is that right?  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, when I was not myself because my mom was going through cancer.  Yeah, sorry about that.  Oh, man.  Sorry I was a little on edge during that time period.  The Colby and Anthony Show on Sirius XM. </pre>
