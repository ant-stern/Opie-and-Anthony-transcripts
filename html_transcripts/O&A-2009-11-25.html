<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Primetime, Sam Roberts, and E-Rod revisiting an embarrassing segment from their early days on WAAF in Boston. This involved a multi-day "war" against WABU-TV, who had cancelled their "Real Rock TV" show allegedly due to Beth Hart's braless appearance and the show's risqu√© content. The hosts recounted their ill-conceived "retaliation": a bra-bombing of WABU-TV from a hot air balloon.  The segment played audio of this stunt, highlighting their cringeworthy acting and overuse of catchphrases like "brother man" and "mother hucker."  Listener calls further contributed to the self-deprecating and humorous tone.  The hosts repeatedly emphasized how poorly executed the stunt was. E-Rod's role in curating the most embarrassing moments was mentioned.  The segment concluded with continued playback of the bra-bombing audio.

The show then transitioned to a segment where Opie and Anthony were actually in a hot air blimp, attempting their real-life bra-bombing mission on WABU-TV using water balloons filled with red paint and bras.  Their reactions to repeatedly passing helicopters ("What the heck is that?"), their improvised "war talk" ("Yo, dude! Back off!"), and near-collisions during the "bombing run," including hitting a car, were documented.  Listener calls reacted to the bizarre situation, with some expressing embarrassment. Profanity and offensive language were heavily used throughout.

Following this, the show played a "Deaf Operator" segment featuring Opie, Anthony, and guest Bob Kelly making extremely sexually explicit and offensive calls to a telephone relay service for the deaf, repeatedly pushing the operator's limits.  The operator frequently interrupted to ask them to slow down or repeat themselves.

The broadcast then featured a segment with comedians Rich Voss and Mike Birbiglia arguing, moderated by former WWE superstar JBL and show employee Roland.  This involved insults and disagreements between Voss and Birbiglia, with JBL and Roland occasionally intervening.  A discussion about an "anti-energy drink" and Anthony's offensive comments about its purple packaging were part of this segment.

A subsequent segment featured a lengthy conversation with JBL.  The discussion began with JBL's upcoming pay-per-view match but quickly moved to the US economy and politics, specifically the 2008 housing crisis, the presidential election, government bailouts, and the national debt. JBL offered independent political critiques. The conversation frequently veered into unrelated tangents and personal attacks between the hosts, Voss, and Birbiglia.  A concurrent Scrabble game saw Voss significantly outperforming Birbiglia. JBL's driver, Joe, participated in witty banter and even a brief karate demonstration with Voss.  Numerous offensive jokes, many based on stereotypes, were made. The conversation also included discussions of JBL's past experiences (boxing match, beer-drinking contest), "gay" wrestling moves (including a detailed description of an explicit Japanese move), promotional strategies for JBL's "drank" anti-energy drink, and personal insults between the hosts and JBL. Voss's unsuccessful comedy attempts were a recurring theme.  The wives of Voss and JBL were mentioned, with comments made about their careers and appearances. The segment concluded with continued sparring and personal insults between the hosts and JBL.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Iron Sheik. You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Primetime, Sam Roberts, and E-Rod.  Ah, okay. This is the Iron Sheik. You have one more time to read it.  You're listening to the worst. You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, hosted by Primetime, Sam Roberts, and E-Rod.  This is the Iron Sheik. You guys, this is a little too long for me.  You can do it in parts.  Right. So then just say, you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  You are listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Primetime, Sam Roberts.  Hosted by Primetime, Sam Roberts.  And E-Rod.  And E-Rod.  That's good.  Perfect.  Slow it down, right?  I'm done?  Yep.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. I am E-Rod. He is Sam. You know who we are, but management makes us do this all the time.  Why do you always have to be so negative about that?  I'm not being negative. I'm just, you know, sometimes the listeners go, why do they keep introducing themselves? We know who they are. 
[00:01:00]  Well, they say that about me.  And me.  I haven't heard about you.  I've heard a lot about me.  Well.  It's usually my parents asking, who's that other voice on there? And I go, oh, Sam? They go, no, no, we know Sam.  Yeah, we know Sam.  Oh, I'm like, oh, me. And they're like, oh, we never can tell.  The Nagle family says, who's that idiot that Sam does his show with?  They're so proud.  Yeah, they are.  But anyway, back to the worst of Opie and Anthony. This dips back a little bit. It's some audio from their days in Boston.  Yeah. As bad as Opie and Anthony make fun of other radio shows, they make fun of themselves a lot worse. 
[00:01:30]  Yes, and it's a lot of fun for the actual staff of the show.  Well, it's a lot of fun for you.  Yeah.  Because it's the one time, one of E-Rock's behind the scenes jobs is to archive old Opie and Anthony stuff.  So when you hear an Opie and Anthony bit come to the air that they're horribly embarrassed by, E-Rock has painstakingly gone through this audio to make sure it's horrendous as it can possibly be.  And this is one of those key moments when they decided to do a bit about bombing a television station with bras. 
[00:02:00]  Yes, bra-bombing. The Opie and Anthony show, as we know it today, was not always as edgy as you think it is.  Cutting edge, hilarious, clever. No. Some of it was extremely hacky and scripted.  Here it is. Bra-bombing with a rock bed from the AAF days on the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're ready to be fucked, man.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  Hey, by the way, I like the fact that we're trash in our own acting.  And I heard yesterday there was some kind of a discussion of somebody's prior performances.  Oh, man.  It's beyond reason how bad this is.  Yeah.  I would like to hear some of it. I wasn't here yesterday.  It's sort of a rebuttal to a lot of people who complain that the old days, they always look at the old days through, may I say, rose-tinted glasses. 
[00:03:00]  Yes, you may.  And they look at our early shows back at AAF when we were doing our show up there in Worcester.  Right.  And they say, wow, those were the days for Opie and Anthony.  That's when they put on good radio, quality radio.  It was funny consistently every day.  And they remember these things that just, it wasn't that way.  And it sure was proven yesterday when we played some tape. 
[00:03:30]  Well, it continued, too, when we moved to New York.  And they said N.E.W. was the golden years of Opie and Anthony.  It's always wherever we were.  And I love reading these dopes, you know, trying to disagree with what I was saying yesterday because they just don't know.  They're just dummies with their opinions.  Everyone has an opinion, and that's fine.  Not opinions alike.  Yeah, but your opinion is dumb.  I laid it all out yesterday, and they're still arguing on message boards. 
[00:04:00]  You're just stupid, so just shut up and enjoy the show.  For example, the AAF days, right, when we moved to New York and then we got to start broadcasting back in Boston again.  They're like, oh, you know, they're just not as good as when they were up here the first time.  Here's something about the AAF days.  We went through hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours of old bits we did at AAF and shows and stuff to come up with one lousy CD. 
[00:04:30]  Mm, yeah.  That was it.  That was our greatest hits, basically, of our AAF days.  One CD that came in around 70 minutes.  How did we have a job?  I don't know.  Playing that tape yesterday.  And then with the NAW stuff, there's a lot of people that were turned on to our NAW material when we were off the air for over two years.  But this is what I have to get into these dummies' heads.  The stuff you hear from the NAW days is the stuff that we put out there. 
[00:05:00]  The greatest hits.  The good stuff.  Yeah.  We buried all the days when we sucked a big one, you know.  Yeah.  The days where we didn't feel like being on the air and we were hungover and we put Jim Brewer bits on so we could leave early.  Or we'd come up with excuses why we needed to play a really good bit from earlier in the week three or four times in one week.  Yeah, we used to do that a lot.  These dummies!  You know, this show is way better than it's ever been. 
[00:05:30]  And if you disagree with that, then maybe the show has passed you by.  What can I tell you?  Because we don't have excuses anymore.  We don't play bits, you know, over and over again to fill up time.  You know?  Well, we're riffing and doing a good radio show every single day.  Some days better than the others.  Oh, of course.  Well, that's the nature of this whole thing.  But the tape that we were playing yesterday, oh my God.  I didn't hear any of it.  It's me and Opie in the studio. 
[00:06:00]  And our Real Rock TV show, it was called, was at the last minute yanked from the airwaves of a local television station.  WABU.  WABU.  Which no one knows.  Yeah.  And so we got on and we were very angry, very angry and worked up.  And we had to show them how angry we were and show all the listeners how angry we were.  So we got a hot air blimp and flew over the TV station with bras filled with paint balloons and dropped and did a bombing run. 
[00:06:30]  And we were dressed in fatigues and all this just took place in the studio.  Sell it.  Come on, sell it.  You want to hear some bad acting, some overly energetic and happy to be there radio. 
[00:07:00]  It is so cringeworthy, Jim.  I can't listen to it.  Well, let me ask you a question.  How did your TV show air at all?  Yeah.  So it was on the air for a little while?  How long was it on the air for?  No, before that?  No, no.  See, ABU, this station up there, they picked up this Real Rock TV show.  And we learned yesterday because I forgot.  Beth Hart, she had a song called Immortal that she did live on our show.  But she wasn't wearing a bra and she had tiny little, I mean, nothing. 
[00:07:30]  Nothing going on.  But you could kind of see something through the T-shirt.  So that made this TV station, ABU, drop the show.  So then we had to find another TV show.  Wasn't that the premiere episode?  I believe so.  Yeah, see, so it hadn't aired.  So that's when the bra thing came in.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, so at least there's a tie in there.  And then we had to find another TV station that was a Hispanic TV station.  We were the only hour, there was only one hour of English-speaking programming a week,  and it was this rock show that we were the stars of. 
[00:08:00]  So this is so bad, Jimmy, you weren't here yesterday, that E-Rock was having fun with  this and...  Making fun of us.  And there was nothing we could say.  Had no defense.  Righty?  You just heard all of it, right?  It's...  It's the greatest bit they've ever done in their career.  It's so bad.  There are so many bros, dudes, and mans in there.  Yeah, bro!  All right, dude!  Whoa, dude!  Who wants to keep track of the dudes, the bros, the brother mans? 
[00:08:30]  I can't keep track of anything during this.  It's so difficult.  I'm going to have a hard time not looking at anybody.  I want someone to keep track of a good call, the bros, the dudes, the different ways that...  They're called crutches.  What about tunage?  Tunage.  Can I have somebody keep track of that?  All right.  Okay, sure.  No, I can't.  I address Ant or Op all the time, and I'll never just go, hey, fella, hey, guy. 
[00:09:00]  It's either hey, Ant or Op.  I'll just look and go, hey.  Dude!  I got home yesterday, and my girl, first of all, she turned off the show yesterday because  she got really uncomfortable.  She's one of these people, when she gets really uncomfortable, she has to make it go away.  Kind of like you, Anthony.  And she goes...  Yeah, yeah, I can't be in this situation.  And she asked me as I walked in the door yesterday, she goes, why do you get off on feeling so uncomfortable?  She goes, I don't get it.  You love when other people are uncomfortable around you.  You love when you're uncomfortable. 
[00:09:30]  I go, I don't know.  I don't know why.  I can't take it.  Like, this tape will make me laugh hysterically.  It's so uncomfortable, it'll make me laugh.  Anthony, by the end of this segment, we'll leave the studio.  There's no doubt in my mind.  It is so bad.  It's this...  I'm going to give it a chance.  It's a long time ago.  See, here it is.  And I said this yesterday.  I go, Jimmy will just look at us with that grin on his face and then say something like,  no, no, that's good.  The way you, you know...  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  He just...  He's an ass when it comes to this stuff.  Well, he can't wait.  He just took off his hoodie.  Oh, he's gearing up.  I can appreciate...  Iraq, anything else you want to tell Jimmy about this tape?  Oh.  They had mentioned a lot of the crutches.  Opie tried to develop his own catchphrase, brother man.  Oh, all right.  Well, you got to...  I want a t-shirt.  I was thinking t-shirts and bumper stickers, maybe coffee...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  A little umbrella man.  Oh, geez.  My knuckles are turning white. 
[00:10:30]  Holding on to the edge of the console just thinking about this.  I can't...  It's so embarrassing.  Iraq handed it to me yesterday or two days ago, and he goes, this is really, really uncomfortable.  I was...  He said...  You basically said it was uncomfortable for you to cut it up.  The manufactured energy.  All right, well, you guys are going to war.  You had to have some kind of...  Shut up.  We describe everything.  Theater of the mind, man.  Painting a picture.  You guys were acting like you were really doing it? 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jim.  Oh, yes, yes.  Like it was...  As it was happening...  Oh, Jim, you have no idea.  Wait till you hear...  We're strafed by helicopters.  Oh, Jim.  Bad sound effects.  I'm giving traffic reports because I'm high above Boston.  Look at the smile on Jimmy's face.  He loves this stuff.  And I say to Bob Kelly and Rich Voss, enjoy.  This is a very rare, rare opportunity.  We are...  Get the most of it because this ain't happening anytime soon after this.  Just eating a heaping helping of something that hangs from the lower half. 
[00:11:30]  This tape was never supposed to see the light of day.  This was back in the day when no one really cared about our show.  So no one was taping it.  It wasn't like people were trading the tapes and the bits like they do to this day.  This was buried in a box, a cassette.  It was barely recognizable.  It was in a box where a mouse was living because there was mouse droppings in the box and it was making a nest.  Maybe it was listening to it.  That's right.  I found this cassette. 
[00:12:00]  It was so old and the label was pretty much peeled off the thing.  I'm like, I don't even think this is going to play anymore.  And this was...  I'm convinced this is the only copy of this.  Oh, man.  And now it's seeing the light of day and people are now going to tape it.  But here we go.  Oh, no.  This is how it all started that day.  No.  And I want to make it perfectly clear.  This is 1996.  Yes.  Could we really, like, emphasize the fact that this is old?  This is 12 years ago.  I had been doing radio for maybe a couple of months. 
[00:12:30]  You still had your tool belt on.  Yes, I did.  I didn't know if it was going to work out.  I don't know how it did after listening to this.  And it's labeled War Against WABU TV.  Day three.  Day three.  We've milked this crap for three days.  Day three.  All right.  Just hold on.  Take a...  Grab something.  Hold on.  This is really bad.  Ready?  No.  No, I'm not.  This is how it all began.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  12 years ago. 
[00:13:00]  Good afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stop.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  I'm joking.  I'm joking.  No.  Come on.  There's the high Opie voice.  And what am I saying hey, hey, hey for?  I can't.  You always like to make something when you came back in.  Like, you know, hey, here I am again.  I can't.  People make fun of mine.  I can't.  People make fun of the, you know, my voice.  But your voice is completely different, too.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know.  I just have got a raspy, smoky, drinking voice.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Ugh.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[00:13:30]  The opiate tank's here.  It's drunk, Anthony.  And I'm going to sing a song for you.  Oh, God.  I can't.  All right, ready?  We're going to try to get through the first segment here.  We have to take a break.  But here we go.  Good afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, hey, hey.  Day three of the war against ABU.  F-U, ABU, we hate you.  Oh, yeah.  That's my first catchphrase. 
[00:14:00]  I was hoping to put that on a T-shirt, too.  F-U, ABU, we hate you.  What are you, Dr. Seuss?  I like that.  You like it, Jimmy?  F-U, ABU, we hate you.  Okay, everybody.  B-U.  Put it on a T-shirt.  F-U, ABU, we hate you.  B-U.  You have to put it on a T-shirt.  B-U.  I was convinced back in the day that I was going to come up with the catchphrase that  would just set the town on fire way before syndication.  Everybody would just be walking around with my catchphrase on a T-shirt. 
[00:14:30]  Steve from Bayshore.  Opie's catchphrase should have been printed on toilet paper.  All right, here we go.  We hate you.  And I'm glad to see you brought in your fatigues.  Yes, I am dressed in full military regalia today.  We are in a war, and Anthony and I both have our fatigues on, and we're ready to go.  There's a reason for that, too.  Well, today is the day of retaliation.  Yes.  Now, they are sitting over there at their little TV station wondering what Opie and Anthony 
[00:15:00]  will do to retaliate.  What do they have planned today?  I don't think they're going to expect this one.  I guess you're just going to have to wait and see, A-B-U.  Shaking in your boots a little bit today, are you?  Retaliation will happen.  Easy with the harsh talk.  Shaking in your boots.  Those are fighting words.  Were people outside the studio protesting the war?  I can't.  I can't.  Bring our troops back. 
[00:15:30]  Why?  You were dressed in military regalia?  I like that.  When you walked into the army surplus for your fatigues, we have a bit.  Why is Bob Kelly quiet over there?  I was actually visualizing you, too.  Yeah, don't.  That was making me sick.  Regalia.  Yeah, you're right.  Oh, yeah, the language you hear is very saucy.  Yeah, it's just... 
[00:16:00]  Oh, we were so angry.  Yeah.  Retaliation will happen today on the Opie and Anthony show.  We get serious.  That's right.  No more words, Pally.  No, it's not just start.  Action.  Or retaliation.  That's all we can say right now.  You like this?  I'm a major today.  I say that.  I wanted to be a general, but I couldn't find the stars.  I was like, I'm fine with a major cluster thing here.  Well, why not be a major in that army?  I mean, you're only a major, but in the douche army. 
[00:16:30]  Four stars.  A four-star douche.  Major, major disaster.  Major idiot.  So, I was listening to the old AAF tape today, and Opie used to fake laugh back then, too.  Oh, God.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Copy, paste.  Copy, paste.  It's actually...  It's not great, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. 
[00:17:00]  No, no, no, no.  It's worse.  Thank you, Jimmy, but this is just a setup.  It gets way worse than this.  It's worse.  Way worse.  Than you ever thought it could be.  Hey, well, E-Rock writes...  I don't lie.  This next segment is the Boston Herald article slash a John Tesh comparison slash a surprise  coming after Ticket Blitz Thursday.  Oh, no.  I love surprises.  In this track here, they do something that Jimmy loves when you compare yourself to somebody, 
[00:17:30]  but maybe on an illegal substance.  Maybe, like, you're on crack.  Oh, that's always a good one.  Oh, well.  Uh, something on crack.  Something.  Oh, no.  All right, here we go.  Oh, just...  The My Lai Massacre is easier to listen to than this.  From 1996.  Yeah, this is 1996, 12 years ago.  Why do you have to listen to stuff from when you were in high school?  All right.  I was, uh, I was, uh, I was, uh, 20 years old.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I was 20.  Oh, WABU-TV, the station that brings you the buxom babes of Baywatch, has scrapped Real 
[00:18:00]  Rock TV from its Saturday night lineup for being too risque.  Risque.  Now, the 30-minute infomercial slash entertainment show slated to air at midnight Saturdays for  the next 13 weeks didn't pass muster with station sultan Bob Gordon because of its, uh, unsuitable  content and we ain't talking swimsuits.  Jeez.  Now, Bob Gordon is the problem over there.  He's the big Texan.  Big Texan, stuffy suit.  The Texas sinkhole.  Old mother hucker.  All right, article goes. 
[00:18:30]  That was, uh, another catchphrase.  Yeah, he was trying to get that.  Mother.  Let me, I'm going to keep track of the catchphrase.  Wait, you really were trying to get mother huckers?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which I stole, too, so it's not even mine.  Mother, mother, what is, was it mother hucker?  Yeah, it's a way of saying, you know.  It would look good on a t-shirt, though.  I don't know, Sean, when you guys got fired from you.  When you guys.  Obi just wants to hit one t-shirt and call it quits.  That's right.  He just wants one smiley face.  Have a nice day. 
[00:19:00]  Got the wow shirts out there.  That's kind of a catchphrase, right?  You like Forrest Gump.  We finally hit with Whip Em Out Wednesday.  We were honing our craft.  Yeah, these were the ones that didn't hit.  Right.  Before Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Mother hucker.  Didn't hit, got fouled off at the plate.  How come you didn't go to war when you got fired from your football TV show?  Shut up.  Risque.  Mother hucker.  Article goes on to say, GM Bruce Mittman contends that Gordon was hung up on a braless performer 
[00:19:30]  and a bleeped out four-letter word.  Before he even saw the show, he said it was inappropriate for the station, muttered the miffed Mittman.  After I played a bit of it, he pointed out that Beth Hart wasn't wearing a bra.  Does he think Pamela Anderson wears one on Baywatch, boy?  Good point, Bruce.  Thank you.  And then it goes on to say, this is Gordon's line.  I've seen ladies without bras before, and that was not the reason behind the decision, Gordon said.  Gordon said he was more concerned about the quality of the production and the bleeped words. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, those bleeped words.  Well, they're backpedaling now because they've given us many reasons why our show has been banned on ABU.  But Bob, what did you expect from this station that really rocks?  I admit I never listened.  This is Bob Gordon.  Oh, my God.  That one hurt.  Oh, that actually, I felt that.  I felt that between my legs.  That one made you a little uncomfortable.  Can I tell you what I just went through on that one?  Yeah.  When you said really rocks, there was a moment after where I went, oh, my God, that wasn't ironic. 
[00:20:30]  Steve from Bay Show wants to know if there was a helium leak at the AAF studios.  When are the blimp attacks?  We've got to build up to it for three days.  No, well, no, that's coming.  Is this college radio?  We said yesterday we bitched about that we were underpaid, and now I'm starting to think maybe we were paid. 
[00:21:00]  Should send money back.  Exactly what we deserved.  It really rocks.  I admit I never listened.  This is Bob Gordon.  This sums up the article.  You're not going to believe this.  I admit I never listened to WAF until this show was brought to my attention.  I thought it was going to be more of an Entertainment Tonight kind of program.  It wasn't.  He said, who are we, John F. in Tesh?  We're John Tesh on acid, maybe, but unbelievable. 
[00:21:30]  John Tesh on acid.  On acid, maybe.  Who are we, John F. in Tesh?  I showed them.  Yeah, we're, wow.  We're scary.  Watch out for us.  1996.  Yes.  Who are we, John F. in Tesh?  We're John Tesh on acid, maybe, but...  Unbelievable.  So day three of the war continues.  There will be a retaliation today.  That is all I'm saying.  ABU is going to be quite surprised. 
[00:22:00]  All right.  Also on the way, it's Ticket Bliss Thursday.  Chance to win tickets to see Gallagher at the new odd.  See Gallagher.  See Gallagher.  Were you opening for him, too?  We got to put off our big war to give away Gallagher tickets.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  All right.  We're tough guys.  Oh, here's some Gallagher tickets.  Oh, look.  Dan's holding up the break sign.  Means we have to break.  Yeah, that's too bad.  We better break.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst. 
[00:22:30]  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, coming up after the break, we're continuing on with some Boston days.  Brab bombing.  Brab bombing.  Stay tuned.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Jimmy, you want to set the scene for the people that are just tuning in?  Well, apparently, there was many years ago, 1996, when Opie and Anthony were at WAAF.  There was some serious stuff going on.  They had a TV show, which was apparently a hit, which was canceled by a censoring network. 
[00:23:00]  By the way, I found all the Real Rock TV shows.  That's something no one really has, and they will start appearing up on the website.  We're not allowed to mention.  Right.  That pretty much is the name of our radio show.  Yeah, I figured it out.  So, this is some audio from the show.  When they got back at the TV station, I mean, this was Craig dressed up like military guys.  They were dropping balloons with bras on them and crazy stuff out of a hot air balloon. 
[00:23:30]  It was madness.  Oh, this is so bad.  And they had been building up to it for a few days, and this was day three of the war.  This was the big assault.  This was what we were gearing up for.  We were gearing up for.  We were going to go and take a hot air dirigible type balloon, two-person balloon, and fly it  over the TV station, and then drop paint that is in brassieres on the television station. 
[00:24:00]  All over those mother-huckers.  All over them.  Get them.  Go get them, boys.  All those mother-huckers.  So, yeah, we go back to the tape that's well over 12 years old at this point, and here's  the attack from the sky, brother man.  I guess we're setting up what we're going to do here.  Lots of man, dudes, bros.  Iraq is having so much fun with this the last couple days.  Big smile on his face for the first time in well over a year.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  In this bit, Ope is really trying to stress his catchphrase, brother man.  Why not?  You have a huge audience for the war.  You might as well sell some shirts.  Get some T-shirts going.  Puffy mugs.  Maybe an ice scraper or two with brother man on it.  Whoa, hey.  Ice scraper.  Hold back on.  Scrape your windshield with a brother man ice scraper.  Whoa, hey.  Outrageous.  Plastic beer mugs.  Got this from a shark jock.  Whoa, watch out.  Oh, gosh.  Iraq, he's pushing the catchphrase hard? 
[00:25:00]  He just keeps working it in when he can.  I'm glad he should have.  I'm sure it's been more natural.  Jimmy, you're condescending crap.  Can I not please devil's advocate?  Craft is killing me.  And I just realized that I continue to try the catchphrase thing because I'm trying to  get lingy-longy going.  So, beep, beep.  Some things don't end.  Didn't Hitler have a cat phrase?  A cat phrase.  Meow.  Cat phrase.  It's a cat phrase.  All right.  Back to this 12-year-old show. 
[00:25:30]  I'm getting a little nervous.  Why?  I don't know.  Can't back out now, brother man.  I'm not backing out because I'm a little.  It's.  Ah, you really wanted to let it go.  That was a good, like, a little incentive for me because I was getting a little nervous.  And, hey, you can't back out now, brother man.  Sure you are.  I'm surprised you guys didn't cut your fingers and become blood brothers first.  Brother man.  Unfortunately, Pony Boy.  They're already taking Stegold.  That would have been a perfect opportunity. 
[00:26:00]  I'm trying to pump him up.  I'm.  I'm.  I'm.  I would have left.  I'm Newt Rockne, man.  I'm just getting.  Getting Anthony ready.  Oh, yeah.  I'm patting.  You're Matt Dillon.  Pat.  Come on.  Let's do it for Johnny, brother man.  Do it for Johnny.  Right, brother.  Do it for Johnny.  Oof.  All right.  I got to hold on again.  Okay.  Okay.  Go ahead.  That's not bad.  Shut up, Jimmy.  Hold on.  It's horrid.  And don't even say it's not.  It's.  It's weird.  The difference between it and I.  It's really uncomfortable.  But for some reason, I really enjoy the uncomfortable. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  I can't.  Anthony can't even look at anyone in the room.  No.  I got to just stare.  Come on, brother man.  Look over here.  Shut up.  Come on.  You can do it, brother man.  There you go.  Shut up.  Come on.  Don't be a mother hucker.  Look how Bob Kelly's sitting up nice and straight.  Oh, he is happy today.  He's got confidence, man.  He's not slouching.  He's never.  He's never had anybody with so many cat phrases.  He didn't realize you almost ruined us.  You dope him.  Thank God boss is here. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  I'm sure he'll say something else stupid.  It'll be about him eventually.  I'll be out, woof.  Ready?  Ready?  All right.  All right.  I'm holding on.  Why?  I don't know.  You can't back out now, brother man.  I'm not backing out, but I'm a little.  It's scary.  The whole thought of this is a little scary.  If you're just tuning in, it is day three of the war against ABU.  And we're stepping it up a notch, let's say.  I don't think ABU can stop us at this point.  No.  No, no. 
[00:27:30]  It would take a lot to stop us at this point.  Actually, Anthony and I got to leave the studio.  Yeah, an off switch.  Jimmy.  I hate that Jimmy is here for this.  We told everyone yesterday, we're not going to get to this thing until Thursday when Jimmy  gets back.  He comes back a day early and we got the rest of the guys in here.  Look at Anthony's white knuckles.  I'm grabbing this console so tight.  Oh, yeah.  That's what happens when you take it up the dock. 
[00:28:00]  It's crazy.  Oh, Jimmy.  This is my worst sign, man.  You know, brother, man, for back then.  Wasn't bad for back then, right?  Oh, I'm saying.  Actually, Anthony and I got to leave the studio in about a half hour or so.  And never come back, hopefully.  We have to rendezvous.  We got a rendezvous at a secret location.  Right.  We got our fatigues on.  We're dressed in full military regalia.  Again.  Too much, man.  And we will be retaliating from the sky this afternoon.  We learned a lesson from Desert Storm a few years back that you got to pound him from 
[00:28:30]  the air first.  That's right.  All right.  What are you going to do?  Okay.  Shut up.  What do you know, Anthony?  I'm not repeating anything.  I'm not saying anything.  Why?  I just want to go away.  I want to go away.  We have a war going on now.  Maybe we can help them out.  How do you do it?  You what?  You pound him from the air?  Bobby.  Yes, sir.  Shut up.  Just shut up.  Why?  You're asking legit questions. 
[00:29:00]  You've got to get out of the studio in a half hour.  You should have said that at 530 this morning.  Yeah.  Decided to play that.  Why don't you act like a general?  Yes.  Brother man.  I can't listen to this.  We're hacking.  It's killing me.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, Chris.  This is day three of the war, huh?  Yeah.  So would this be your double D day? 
[00:29:30]  It's a bra joke because we're going to drop bra bombs.  Are we?  Oh, my God.  Man's dressed in a full regalia.  Again.  Oh, regalia.  I couldn't say it.  Regalia.  Regalia.  Shut up.  If they didn't tune in at three to hear regalia, they heard it at four.  That's important.  Yeah.  Brother man.  You're right.  You got to pound them from the air first.  That's right.  Before you could launch the ground assault.  So we're going for an air assault. 
[00:30:00]  That's right.  They are going to be surprised, aren't they, brother man?  Oh, brother.  Oh, no.  How did we get a job?  How did we get a job in New York?  You know how I said I enjoy this?  A couple shots to the head.  Come on, brother man.  I'm going to see how much of this I can take.  Wow.  A couple shots to the noggin.  Oh, boy. 
[00:30:30]  This is so.  Every time I hear brother man, it's something inside me.  It's like I'm getting shocked.  Oh, wow.  That's rough.  I think you guys are good together.  I think you're really working off each other well.  I agree.  No, seriously.  You get all the terminology and you do the pep talks.  Come on, brother man.  Yeah.  This is going to be war.  This is the whole buildup.  See, we're trying to paint the picture so that once we take to the air, everyone will  believe it, man.  Dude, who's getting out of that car with this on? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  I wish I was at 60.  Let's go to Nathan in Virginia.  Nathan.  Hey, what's up, boy?  Hey.  Hey, why the hell were you guys in fatigue if you was in a hot air balloon in the sky?  Well, maybe they were dressed.  This guy's the voice of reason.  They had cloud shirts on.  Those cloud hats.  Yeah, Anthony had like a little bird painted on his shirt.  I hope he had an airplane on his back.  We couldn't even do hack radio, right? 
[00:31:30]  I know.  This guy brings up a valid point.  Let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared.  Hey, guys.  Was this before or after Rocco stole the van and decided to camp out on a billboard?  Let's go to Peter in Maine, I think.  Peter.  Yes.  Opie, are you ready to hate my guts?  Yeah, go ahead.  I was listening to, you know, I was doing some stuff and kind of half listening to, you 
[00:32:00]  know, some of the old bits.  And I swear to God, old Opie sounds like E-Rock.  I think E-Rock kind of modeled himself after the original Opie tapes.  Yeah, E-Rock ripped me off.  Yeah.  I was doing garlic buttersaw way before E-Rock was.  I know.  His hot air balloon's parked outside.  His regalia.  Pat from Wunaki wants to know after the war, did me and Opie have a big kiss in Times Square?  Fruits. 
[00:32:30]  Are going to be surprised, aren't they, brother man?  Oh, brother.  If we die doing this, I'm going to be pissed.  You are.  Yeah, it's too big idiot.  Yeah, that's right, Doug.  Who won't do that?  Oh, wow.  And I am.  Wow.  What was that at the end there?  I don't know.  No, I don't care.  That's right.  They are going to be surprised, aren't they, brother man?  Oh, brother.  If we die doing this, I'm going to be pissed. 
[00:33:00]  We'd go down in history, though, dude.  Yeah, it's too big idiot.  Yeah, that's all right, Doug.  Yep.  All right, Keanu.  Certainly did.  That was pretty harsh, you had to jump in there.  Two big idiots.  Wow.  Oh, mighty.  Guns blazing.  Jimmy.  And he's going to surprise them.  Two fat heads.  Feel like a lunk head.  How is this going to surprise you?  Are they going to be in the building going, are those bras landing on the roof?  Wait a second.  Those sound like bras. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, just wait.  New message board name.  It's already taken.  Brother man.  Brother man.  And E-Rock has looked up brother man.  What do you got on that E-Rock?  From Urban Dictionary.  A word used to describe an extremely down-to-earth individual.  Brother man, are you and Big...  Sorry.  Are you and Brother Dabin going over to PQ's house to hang with the brothers from KBC?  A lot of KBC.  Let's go to Richie in Connecticut.  Richie.  F-U, A-B-U.  We hate you. 
[00:34:00]  Richie.  Linger.  Yuck.  We play this.  This was rough yesterday when we played this.  This was one of the clips we did play yesterday.  Oh, no.  It's me.  It's me coming out of a record.  The only station that really rocks, Beth Hart Band, Immortal. 
[00:34:30]  We love you, Beth Hart.  She's the troublemaker.  She's the troublemaker.  She wouldn't wear a bra.  She is one of the reasons why the TV show was banned by W-A-B-U in Boston because Beth Hart,  in the footage of her playing that song for our TV show, she was not wearing a bra.  Right.  You two should be attacking each other.  That's what you should be doing.  Sitting on each end of the studio, throwing funny lines at each other. 
[00:35:00]  And maybe one will catch one.  Wow.  Do you really think it was her not wearing a bra that got you kicked off the air?  You guys are the reason that just crap radio.  Someone's home going, if they can do this, so can I.  Okay?  1996.  Never realized how just hacky, zooey we sounded.  Why?  With that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:35:30]  Everything had to have a laugh behind it and just.  We found our voices up there because we started getting very angry.  And we changed our whole delivery, thank God.  Who heard this and thought, like, these guys have to get it to New York?  The question is, who didn't?  Well, here's the last minute before we have to.  Let's just play it.  Oh, no.  Sophie and Anthony, we are in an unmarked van.  Here it is, the phone call. 
[00:36:00]  Well, I guess we have officially left the broadcast center.  Where were we?  We were just in a production.  Well, we were literally in the production studio.  We never left the radio station.  Oh, no, we did.  I think we.  Calling.  Wow, I don't remember.  I remember for some.  Yeah, no, we were.  We ended up in a.  I think this is us in a van going to the IHOP, which was close to the TV station, just to 
[00:36:30]  check out, to see if they were going to believe what we were doing.  Oh, is that it?  I believe.  Since you're servicemen, do they feed you free at the IHOP?  I mean, you come in, you're just not.  I'm your way of the battle.  Do you think a couple pancakes for the boys?  I mean, some good old guys like you without a catchphrase.  In full uniform, which in their case was with a nozzle hanging off their heads.  All right, you ready?  It's time to get the.  Oh, this is not good.  When do you drop the bras from Bobby? 
[00:37:00]  See, it doesn't even work goofing on anybody else now.  You guys are free.  You have a pass.  Yes, we do.  You all have a pass.  So this is.  This is the official deployment of Operation Bra Bomb.  I like you're in an unmarked van, too.  Yeah.  We said that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Unmarked.  Like, there's no marking.  Like, what other marks would there be?  Guys on way to Bra Bomb?  I remember when the recruiters came to my school to get me to enlist into this war. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, it was for the Civil War.  Okay, that's funny.  Ready?  And then they'll be free and running through the streets.  And you joined up, didn't you?  Sophie and Anthony, we are in an unmarked van right now, bro.  This is too much.  I'm getting nervous, man.  Don't get nervous.  We got to do the retaliation against WABU for screwing us over with our TV show, man.  Tell everyone where we're off to, bro.  All right, we're going to a secret location, which is a parking lot. 
[00:38:00]  And we're actually going to get into a hot air blimp.  Pause this.  I see a little flaw here.  You're sure you're not going to a tie-dye festival?  A little question here.  The van's unmarked.  Undisclosed location.  So you can get into a blimp.  You know, I'm not even thinking about the logistics of this whole thing that you're pointing out. 
[00:38:30]  I'm just thinking of the awfulness of it.  But you're pointing out some very valid things here.  You know how hard it is to hide a blimp in Worcester?  And you hear Opie stutter through it, but just end with bro to say whatever.  There's one thing Opie did there, too, which I love.  It was to explain why they were doing it.  Like, it was kind of like coming back, like, you know, to avenge our TV.  Yes, yeah, he had to spoon-feed the audience.  It's called spoon-feeding there, Jimmy.  Let's say how to carrot a jersey. 
[00:39:00]  Carrot.  Boo.  Let's go to John in Staten Island.  John.  Instead of an unmarked van, you just should have had a van with a giant douche on the side.  Oh, my God.  You know what it is?  You've got to go unmarked.  This way the competition doesn't know you're coming.  You've got an undisclosed location so the cops won't be waiting for it.  Of course.  That's right.  Just back that blimp into the Walmart with all the other blimps. 
[00:39:30]  It's a dirigible.  You act like it's a VW van.  It's a hot air blimp, and we're going to fly over ABU and bomb them with bras and water balloons.  Well, we're calling them the bra bomb.  Basically, they're water balloons with bras attached to them.  Now that they're on to this, we're probably going to have to get through their air defenses.  We'll be checking in in a few minutes here. 
[00:40:00]  In the meantime, we might as well play the latest from Van Halen.  We weren't even good enough yet to just do our talk show.  We weren't allowed to just talk.  See, when you have to pepper in music, you're not good enough to do a talk show yet.  This is really early on.  You're going to bomb a TV studio, which is probably illegal on a lot of them.  But first, let's get to OU812.  And don't forget the Gallagher concert.  Twelve years ago. 
[00:40:30]  Just want to say that.  Twelve years ago.  Oh, yes.  Latest from Van Halen off the greatest hit CD that's coming out.  This song features David Lee Roth.  Oh, my God.  Anthony's getting excited.  Give me your beer, man.  We are cranking up Van Halen in the car here.  Why couldn't the blimp have the same fate as the Hindenburg?  A lot of comments coming in. 
[00:41:00]  Air defenses against a blimp.  A bunch of interns on the roof with fans.  Let's go to Nigel in Kentucky.  Nigel.  This is terrible.  Yes.  Yes.  About the aircraft you were using to bomb their TV station, it wasn't the Enola gay.  It was just gay.  It was just gay.  Gay.  Let's say hi to Brandon.  Brandon, what's up?  Hey, boys. 
[00:41:30]  Hey.  I think this needs to be the next Coke Logic animation.  Oh, my God, yeah.  It would make a good one.  Yeah, it sure would.  I know what part he could use, too.  We got audio from us in the sky, which is...  Oh, once we hit the sky and the blimp, you won't believe the action.  How did you make the wind effect?  Oh, you...  Wait, so you hear the sound effects.  Well, it's...  We had a lot to work with in the production room.  Well, it's just...  All right.  We're getting there. 
[00:42:00]  I think we can squeeze one more minute in, and then when we get back from break, it's  us actually in the air bombing the...  You don't have to use a stop right there.  ...TV station.  Bombing.  Let's go to Caesar in Staten Island.  Caesar.  Yeah.  I'm just wondering if the title of this little war episode was called We Were Morons.  Oh, no.  There goes another bit that's starting.  A band of brother mans. 
[00:42:30]  Well, here we go.  Sophie and Anthony, we are at our destination.  Oh, man.  This thing is unreal.  Look at this thing.  It's a blimp, but it's tiny.  I feel like I'm there.  Don't you?  I'm painting a picture.  This thing's unreal.  Look at this thing.  It's a blimp.  But it's tiny.  Tiny.  Blimp, but tiny. 
[00:43:00]  Black Hawk Down Syndrome.  People are coming in with movies.  Oh, boy.  A crock of shit now.  Saving private douche.  Full metal.  We're going to need some lope wisers during the break.  The only thing that's going to save us.  Well, I can't.  Well, you're seeing the blimp now.  I got to hear more of this. 
[00:43:30]  I feel like I'm in the car with you.  Sounds amazing.  It's tiny.  I'm not getting in this.  It's crazy.  It's got one of those propane things to get us up in the air and a couple engines to get  us moving forward.  But, hey, they bet I have gas in it.  I'm not going to be drifting all over Boston.  Did you hear that guy just beep at us?  That was pretty funny, actually.  Okay, we are about ready to start our retaliations against WABU.  We're climbing into the craft.  Dude, hold the phone for a second.  I got to get this box of bra bombs into the craft. 
[00:44:00]  Load it up.  This is the dumbest thing I've ever been part of, man.  I am.  I'm actually a little scared.  And we look stupid.  If we die, I'm in a stupid flight suit like Tom Cruise wore it in Top Gun.  I'm going to look like an idiot.  Oh, boy.  No, after Top Gun, Tom Cruise could hold his head up high.  I'm not going to look like an idiot.  You really got boozed on that last line.  I really did.  I lost myself.  I'm not going to do this.  I'm not going to die with this suit on.  Shut up. 
[00:44:30]  I like the fact that as you're broadcasting, you're like, here, hold this.  I have to load these bras in.  Why not just do it in the small place?  Why not have guys with you or preload it?  Stop being logical, you ask.  We got to explain it.  Like it's a movie or something.  Where's the guy that actually filled the balloon up for you?  There was just a balloon waiting for you in a field?  And there's also these awful, you know how bad it is to do like these remotes?  You guys had perfect quality while you were moving around.  Yes, we did.  Here, hold this.  It sounds just like it did 10 seconds ago in the van while I'm outside. 
[00:45:00]  Even in the blimp, it sounds amazing.  I don't.  Never cuts out.  I don't remember this.  I would try to blank it out, too.  Oh, I was thinking that yesterday.  I don't remember doing this.  I don't remember like recording it.  I have no idea what's going to happen next.  Like, I feel like I'm hearing this for the first time.  It's so weird.  It's like when you get molested.  You just buried it.  We buried it.  Let's go to Steve.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Steve.  Yeah, this sounds like mission unlistenable.  Unlistenable. 
[00:45:30]  Oof.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Oof.  Gone.  I'm going to look like an idiot.  Well, Anthony, explain the craft again.  It's a Jensen AS-111.  It's, like you said, it's controlled by propane, but it's got two Briggs & Stratton 10-horse engines  so we could putt around the skies in it.  The guy, Al, gave me this, uh, a crash course, and I hate using the word crash, but a crash  course on how to fly, and you're going to be the navigator and bombardier. 
[00:46:00]  This is going to be fun, actually.  I'm scared.  If you're getting in your car to drive home, I would look up in the sky because we should  be getting at, uh, we should be getting over WABU.  Within 20, 25 minutes from right now, and we will drop these broad bombs on top of WABU,  like it or not. 
[00:46:30]  Go for the transmitter.  Go for the transmitter.  Wow.  Like it or not.  That's tough talk.  I'm surprised you weren't dropping job applications.  This guy, John from Virginia, General Hack Arthur.  Went through his one line.  Full metal jack-offs.  Oh, boy. 
[00:47:00]  Transmitter.  Go for the transmitter.  And they can't stop us.  They want to censor us.  Well, they're going to have to deal with a little retaliation, all right?  All right, bro.  We should rock on with some tunes.  We're jumping in the crap.  And Godspeed.  Next time you talk to us, we will be in the air.  Hopefully, he'll be off the air soon.  Okay, terrific.  That's terrible. 
[00:47:30]  I'm sorry.  You need to play all those together.  Well, unfortunately, we've got to do other things today, so we...  I'm not...  Wait, what?  What?  Try to find your dignity.  I want to listen.  From 1996.  Yeah.  Yeah.  12 years ago.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, yeah.  Brother bro.  Brother man.  Don't be a mother hugger.  Yeah.  Hey, fella guy.  Fella guy.  When we get back. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, dude sister.  We got O&A Airborne.  Oh, man.  It's uncomfortable for anyone to listen to this, is what E-Rock wrote.  And what was the rest of this?  What?  What was the rest of it?  Not uncomfortable?  Right.  It's been...  No, no.  The next clip is the reason you're listening today.  It is...  Anthony will walk out of the studio.  I can't.  I don't know why.  He will hide.  He will have to leave.  Dude, the bottom line is this.  I mean, we all get pushed around in life.  You guys weren't going to take it. 
[00:48:30]  You are an ass, man.  I can't take you sitting here.  If I had access to a little blimp, Jensen wasn't...  I'm so glad it only takes one sense to listen to you guys.  If I had to taste this, I'd smell it.  I would throw up right now.  Imagine if we really did this.  There would be just a janitor on the roof, just annoyed, just sweeping up bras.  Like, what did this do?  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  Gave me something to do for an hour.  Oh, we're the worst.  Well, let's say hi to Eric in New Jersey.  Eric?  Hey, what is this?  Pearl Horrible?  Let's go to Chris in Houston.  Chris?  What's up, boy?  Hey.  Apocalypse.  Ugh. 
[00:49:30]  All right.  We're going to take it right.  When we get back, we will be in the air as we look back to a show we did 12 years ago.  Bora, Bora, Bora.  Oh, is that a good one?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Who wrote that one?  Oh, viral load.  It's the worst of Opian Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, coming up after the break, we're continuing on with some Boston Days brah bombing. 
[00:50:00]  Brah bombing.  Stay tuned.  It's the worst of the Opian Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opian Anthony.  I am E-Rock.  He is Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Yes, I am.  How are you doing?  Good.  We're playing some audio from their Boston Days.  Of course, more brah bombing.  You didn't think it was over, did you?  I kind of thought it was.  No way, dude.  This just keeps going on.  He's going and going, and he's going to continue.  Here it is, brah bombing on the worst of the Opian Anthony show.  Who the fuck is listening?  To the worst.  Who's fucking listening? 
[00:50:30]  To the worst.  The worst.  Of Opian Anthony.  F-U-E-Rock.  It's Opian Anthony.  Oh, God.  I got to strap in again.  Here's your collective soul.  We have a few gems from some of the audience.  Yeah, we're in the middle of listening to a show we did 12 years ago for the people  that, unfortunately, just tuned in.  You missed a lot.  Just months after our debut.  In Boston radio.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  It's funny.  Instead of platoon, how about buffoon?  And this guy, you should call it Bridge Over River Queer.  Ram Bro.  That was another one I got.  Chris from Pennsylvania.  Boar of the world.  My favorite here is from Spike W. New Hampshire.  Full metal hack bit.  I got the longest show.  The yawn patrol. 
[00:51:30]  How about Butch and Jersey?  Butch.  An O&A double feature.  Ford on the 4th of July.  Followed by Bridge Over the River.  Why?  Mm-hmm.  Bridge Over the River.  Why?  Instead of why.  Ah, Kelly's Zeros.  An officer and a brother man.  Chris Cole from Wack Bay.  Casualties of Boar. 
[00:52:00]  Operation Shock and Awful.  Tony J. from Connecticut.  Well, James G., dump out if you have to.  North Carolina.  This sounds like fags of our fathers.  Ah, very good.  So, you want to set the stage here, Jimmy?  Um, yeah.  It's, uh, there was apparently a TV show open at 96.  It was critically acclaimed.  It was a big fan following. 
[00:52:30]  And they censored it.  I found the tapes.  I'll bring the first episode in tomorrow.  And we'll put it up on the fine website that is named after the show that we cannot promote.  And it was W, uh, what was it, ABU or ABU, right?  Uh, they took the show off the air, and they were about to rue that decision.  Opie and Anthony got a, uh, a blimp, and we're going to drop paint-filled bra bombs on the station. 
[00:53:00]  Bra bombs, yeah.  Bra bombs, yeah.  That's, uh, what we were armed with.  Well, because we were, uh, collecting bras.  I remember this part.  We were collecting bras for a while.  And we were going to, like, hang the bras in protest across the, uh, Charles River.  But the station thought that would not be a good idea.  We would get in, uh, real trouble.  So, then we had to go into the land of fantasy. 
[00:53:30]  And, um, the whole thing is just, and I just found this out.  Yeah.  Because you hear them, and they're, like, broadcasting from the van, and then Opie's loading things  into the blimp, and Ant's got, like, they get the military clothes, and all of a sudden,  like, we're on break, and they're like, you know, we were in studio the whole time.  I'm like, get out of here.  You were not in studio the whole time.  Yeah.  Hard to believe, wasn't it?  I was sporting outdoors.  Hard to believe.  This, um, is really uncomfortable.  Strap in, Ant.  Oh, God, I don't think I could, uh.  Well, don't forget, they were in full, full regalia. 
[00:54:00]  Absolutely.  We are.  Full.  Very regalia.  Military, hot air balloon.  As we pick up the show from 12 years ago.  12 years ago.  12 years ago.  1996.  Which isn't that long ago.  We are in the air.  I know.  I think we're on the air, bro.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We are heading for our aerial assault.  We're about 600 feet off the ground, over the Charles River, heading out of Boston,  heading toward our target.  Don't look at me like that, Jimmy.  People are looking up and waving at us, man.  This thing is unreal.  We're in a hot air. 
[00:54:30]  This really is.  They're waving.  They're waving goodbye.  Yeah.  Off the Boston airwaves.  I don't think it goes to waving with one finger.  Oh, and those things that were waving, they were the ratings.  I hate the look Jimmy's giving me.  Oh, it's great.  It's this awful, like, pitied look. 
[00:55:00]  Blimp sounds.  Wait till you hear the helicopters, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  I love how their voice is getting louder because they have to talk over the engines.  Oh, of course.  It's crazy.  You're in a hot air.  What's up?  Yeah, yeah.  Ant, on the phone.  Yes.  Hey.  We lost you?  Oh, come on, man.  We're in.  All right.  Jeff, Jersey, what's up?  What's up, brother?  Chester's liver.  I'm sorry.  From here to obscurity.  What do you got, Jeff? 
[00:55:30]  The next video to go viral, two guys, all crap.  All right, let's start.  Man, this thing is unreal.  We're in a hot air blimp.  This thing is really small.  I just read what I had.  John from Virginia.  Platools.  The Tuskegee brother, man. 
[00:56:00]  This is so embarrassing.  Let's say hi to Danny in Brooklyn.  Danny.  Yeah, what's going on?  The good, the bad, the stupid.  He's going back a little ways.  Unreal.  We're in a hot air blimp.  This thing is really small, and we're on a bombing mission, man.  We're going to bomb ABU.  You got to love that, man.  What the heck is that? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, my God.  What was that?  Oh, my God.  They didn't.  You yelled, what was that?  It must have been a good idea.  Nobody recognized it.  Stop being logical.  I told you.  Stop.  Your bombing mission started when you wrote this bit.  That's when it started.  This is when we used to write shit.  Look at this.  He's cursing.  He's cursing. 
[00:57:00]  Don't get crazy, brother man.  This is so hard to listen to.  You can't stop in the middle.  I'm cursing.  I'm sorry.  What's happening?  Well, we don't know what just happened.  It must have been a good idea.  Ready?  Yeah, what was that?  What the heck is that?  Oh, my God.  What was that?  Are you all right, bro?  Yeah.  That was a traffic copter.  I guess they're doing the traffic report.  Wait, can I ask the question?  You start off by going, what the heck is that? 
[00:57:30]  And then all of a sudden, you guys get like, whoa, what is that?  Like, how did you not recognize a helicopter?  That was dropping panties.  I don't understand how a helicopter, a traffic copter came by.  Yeah.  And you like, you saw it and then it moved.  And then all of a sudden, you didn't recognize it.  How did you not recognize it was a helicopter?  I should have, Jimmy.  I really should have recognized that.  You said this was a propane propeller Jensen. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  But you didn't recognize a helicopter.  Briggs and Stratton engine.  And well, well, I, uh, what is that obscure thing that flew by us?  I have never seen one of these before.  I guess they're doing the traffic report.  Wait, can we hear the, I got to hear the bump again.  Can we please hear that?  Because I let you go, what the heck is that?  And then boom, you know.  What the heck is that?  Oh, my God.  What was that?  Are you all right, bro?  Yeah.  That was a traffic copter. 
[00:58:30]  I guess they're doing the traffic report because, uh, we're very close.  Is that what you guess they're doing?  We have actually just-  Hold on.  Not only.  Here he goes.  That's how we're going to get through this.  Here he goes.  Hold on.  This is a four-minute clip.  We've done 20 seconds.  Not only did Anthony not recognize a helicopter.  He almost got hurt.  Thank God you're okay.  But Ope not only knew exactly what it was, he knew what they were there for.  It's a traffic copter.  It's the, uh, the news is five. 
[00:59:00]  And, uh, I don't understand how you knew exactly what the helicopter was.  Steve Pike from Boston.  Red yawn.  Yeah.  Casualties of this bit.  Oh.  We are very close to the Mass Pike.  Like, we have actually just passed over the BU bridge, and I can see the Mass Pike, and  actually, traffic is really, really bad today.  It looks like all the cars are stopping and looking up in the air for something.  Wait, now, now you're doing the traffic report.  The traffic report. 
[00:59:30]  On the way to an attack, a big mission, you decide to do traffic.  And also, the people are waving at them, and they can see traffic is stopped, and yet  the helicopter, five feet away from the blimp, nobody seems to know nothing.  What is that mysterious whirly bird?  Is that a pterodactyl?  No, Anthony, it's a helicopter.  We have traffic reports sponsored by.  Why are you doing this to me?  But apparently, what happened to traffic was stopped, everybody's looking up, they're  probably like, is this crap actually coming through my radio antenna? 
[01:00:00]  But they were, they were, they were in full regalia, you know, so the helicopter couldn't  see them.  Opie, your catchphrase should be sorry.  It's like a hat break, Ridge.  You got me laughing so hard, I just drooled to myself.  And looking up in the air for some reason, man.  Yo, dude!  And, dude, give us another blast.  We got to go!  The Red Baron is strafing us, apparently. 
[01:00:30]  Yo, dude, back off!  Oh, man, hit me.  Hold on, that's tough war talk.  That's very genuine, very authentic war talk.  Dude, back off!  That's what Clint Eastwood said in all his movies.  Could you not, could you not listen to this?  But I like the fact that as it's coming, we hear the helicopter, and then they go, whoa!  Were you scared the traffic copter was going to shoot you guys down?  Is that what you're worried about?  Yeah, I thought there might be an accident. 
[01:01:00]  Pass from Munaki.  Pilot to Brombardier.  It's a state trooper copter.  Yo, dude, back off!  Back off.  Oh, man.  That copter was so huge.  Dude, it just blew us off course.  Give us another shot of cocaine.  All right.  Oh, my God.  All right.  You got to take a breath.  They just dropped the bras on Fenway Park.  Hope he needs a standing eight count. 
[01:01:30]  Wow.  And like I admitted earlier, I don't mind being uncomfortable.  I love making other people uncomfortable.  My girl was trying to understand that whole thing yesterday because she said she turned  this show off yesterday when we started playing this crap.  I enjoy it, but every once in a while, I take a jab right to the forehead, and I'm feeling  a little woozy.  Well, dude, the helicopter.  Because I know what's coming next because, you know, we're off course, Jimmy, so, you  know, we got to get back on course.  Sure you do.  I mean, when that giant helicopter blew the blimp off course, I mean. 
[01:02:00]  Of course you got to get back on course.  Meanwhile.  So you can accomplish your mission, right, Jimmy?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You have to.  And now all of a sudden, you don't know what it is, but Anthony recognizes it was  a trooper helicopter.  Yes, it was a state trooper.  Yeah.  A helicopter.  Wow.  You ready?  It'll buzz you as well as the traffic copter.  Everybody's so aggressive with you guys.  How big was this copter that blew you off course?  Shut up.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I mean, the jet stream apparently can't do it, but this four-mile-long jet police crew. 
[01:02:30]  How could you tell it was a state trooper copter?  I know.  How about a police copter?  Trooper copter?  Let's say hi to Jason in Jersey.  Enough out of you.  Hey.  Jason.  What's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, am I listening to Hack Walk Down?  Well, you know what?  We have to get back to the order.  They knew it was a policeman's helicopter because it had a little policeman's hat on the top of  the road.  Like one of the toys, like a Tonka toy helicopter. 
[01:03:00]  Let's go to Joey in North Carolina.  Whip it around a little billy club.  Hey.  How come your helicopter soundtrack is an airplane?  It does, right?  Well, that's all we had.  Low budget.  It's a low-budget production.  Oh, my God.  Let's say hi to Joe.  Joe?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Good.  All quiet on the Western radio.  Cricket.  Cricket.  All right.  Back to the audio. 
[01:03:30]  Oh.  Kevin from Connecticut, he knows a little bit about radio.  I'll bet they arrive at the TV station with, like, four minutes left in the show.  Oh, man.  That copter was so huge.  Dude, it just blew us off course.  Give us another shot of more pain, man.  More juice.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Okay, we are over the next.  The irony of Anthony yelling, more juice, more juice.  I'm sorry. 
[01:04:00]  Oh.  Okay, we are over the Mass Pike.  We are right at the Alston-Brighton interchange, and traffic is really, really backed up.  It looks like everyone is looking up at us, bro.  Wow.  I am scared S-less, man.  It's freezing up here.  It really is.  But the view is awesome.  You can see all the colors of the leaves changing.  What is that?  What? 
[01:04:30]  What?  You just commented on foliage?  That's your observation?  Really?  From the sky?  Before your big attack?  The fall is coming?  Look at the beautiful future.  Wow.  You're going to have to try harder.  I'm still standing.  Barely.  Sounds like an alternative couple on their way to finally be married in Massachusetts.  Oh, my God.  The foliage is changing.  Wow.  This is so hard to sit through.  Now, my fiancee writes, I'm leaving? 
[01:05:00]  Your truck is backed up?  Yeah, but she's got a little sense of humor herself.  She writes, I'm so embarrassed, bro.  This is making me cringe, man.  I'm leaving, dude.  Oh, good.  I hope the helicopter doesn't blow her off course.  Wow.  You see that?  The leaves are changing.  Oh, my God.  It's awesome.  You can see all the colors of the leaves changing.  That's the helicopter.  Come on, man.  Give us a break, dude.  Unbelievable.  It's you too, buddy. 
[01:05:30]  He's got a bottle.  Roadhog.  Give us a break, dude.  Like Mr. Magoo.  Oh, my God.  Why you?  You can just see him shaking his fist.  Give us a break, dude.  Like, come on.  Don't you understand?  We have to do this now.  Come on.  We have to.  Hey, we have to do this now.  We have to screw up Boston airspace.  Right.  So we can drop bras on a building.  It's like, hey.  What is your problem?  And, like, that's what you'd yell at it anyway.  Nobody would yell at a police helicopter buzzing it.  You, hey, leave us alone, bro. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, give us some space, dude.  And it's like, why would cops be after a blimp that was up for three minutes?  Cut us some slack, Jack.  Step off, my man.  Unbelievable.  If you do, buddy.  Hey, these guys are buzzing us like crazy.  This is nuts.  But I see the target.  WABU is inside, buddy boy.  What's held?  Which one?  Buddy boy.  Well, that was another catchphrase I was working on.  I had a lot of, like, hooks in the water. 
[01:06:30]  I was hoping one of these would catch on.  Did you have a hat with a B and a B backwards on each other?  I had buddy boy, brother man.  I had mother hucka, all these hooks in the water, hoping one of these would catch on  and become a t-shirt and a coffee cup slogan.  Hopefully one of, too bad one of those hooks wasn't into the blimp.  End of this.  All right.  Well, as we go to break, we have the target in sight, and we will be bombing the TV station 
[01:07:00]  with our bra bomb.  Oh, my God.  In just a few minutes.  It's the worst.  A very uncomfortable morning for Anthony and I.  This is, uh...  On the Opie and Anthony show.  This is brutal.  Take a look back.  12 years.  A cassette tape I found in a box as I'm finally unloading boxes.  I got other things to bring in in the coming months.  Old articles, old memos, old pictures.  I found the Real Rock TV tapes. 
[01:07:30]  We're going to throw that up on the website that we cannot promote, because it has nudity  on it.  But the website is named after the show.  Is that you, Voss?  No, I swear to God it wasn't.  It wasn't me.  It's Jimmy, of course.  I would say.  Danny?  Smells like rotten eggs.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It smells like this bit.  That's Danny?  No, it's Jimmy.  It smells bad.  It's the bit.  It's got to be.  It's the bit.  That's a very good, Voss.  It's the bit leaking through the CD player, right? 
[01:08:00]  And on our website, we got something we just started.  It's called Old School Opian Anthony, where we're going to start throwing a bunch of these  weird things from the past.  Hopefully, a lot of stuff that you haven't ever heard or seen before or haven't heard  or seen in a really long time.  All right, let's get back to the bit.  We're in the middle of our big raid on the TV station that took our TV show off the air.  Still in here.  And the target is inside as we went to break, right?  Oh, great. 
[01:08:30]  You're on a blimp.  There's traffic.  There's stopped.  Everybody's...  The helicopters are buzzing them.  It's madness like you've never heard before.  That's so exciting.  And the leaves look beautiful.  Yes, don't forget about the foliage.  And a little verbal asterisk is the leaves are changing, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes.  All right.  All right, let's get to it.  ABU is inside, buddy boy.  Which one?  It's that one right over there next to the McDonald's.  You see McDonald's?  Oh, God.  Come on, man.  Yeah, we got these bra bombs that we're going to be dropping on it.  We have a bunch of brassieres and water balloons full of red paint. 
[01:09:00]  And we're going to be dropping them on top of ABU's building.  I'm going to get that satellite dish, man.  Dude, if you get that satellite dish, I'll give you a case of beer, man.  Oh.  A whole case?  You stole that from Apocalypse Now.  I'll give you a case of beer for that one.  A case of beer?  And all of a sudden, he couldn't figure out where the building is.  Now, all of a sudden, he sees the satellite dish.  During war, you have to knock out their communication.  Hey.  There's a little fog over the primary target. 
[01:09:30]  What can I tell you?  Also over your pencil and paper.  You guys are so daring.  You're going to drop water balloons.  You're going to clean the top of the building.  Like it never rains.  Morons.  We're going to show them.  Look how clean that satellite dish is.  It never rains.  Where the building is it?  That one over there.  Oh, yeah.  Let's hit that little satellite dish in the corner and that coffee cup somebody left on the roof.  Let's see. 
[01:10:00]  This is so bad.  When did you throw your dignity out?  I'll give you a case of beer, man.  Yeah.  All right.  Start getting everything right.  Yeah.  All right.  There's about a hundred of these folks behind us in a box at least.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Pump it up.  Pump it up.  Bring it around, dude.  Bring it around.  Okay.  I can't.  Bring it around.  Was someone pointing a shotgun in the wrong direction?  Bring it around.  Do everyone a favor, dude. 
[01:10:30]  End this.  Oh, no.  I'm just reading.  End punt.  End punt.  This is so bad.  See, I think we were losing altitude.  Yeah.  We had to pump, you know, get the propane going to get us back up in the air. 
[01:11:00]  We got some bombs to drop.  Yeah.  Wow.  Propane.  Same thing you used to cook hamburgers.  You guys were flying around the city.  I like the fact that when you offer them a case of beer, you're like, yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Karate City acting.  Losing altitude and listener.  Everyone's got a great, smart-ass comment.  Let's go to Joe on Long Island.  Joe.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  It's a flop gun.  Oh, flop gun.  That's nice.  Bring it around, dude.  Bring it around.  All right.  Now that's it, come on. 
[01:11:30]  No, no.  A little more to the left, bro.  I'll keep it in line.  You heave them over the side.  Wait.  Look at all the people.  You were flying the blimp?  What did you think?  I don't know.  You had a blimp pilot who was licensed to fly a blimp?  He said at the beginning.  I love the revelation of Jimmy just realizing it's just us in there and I'm flying the blimp.  I have to turn it so we're facing the target. 
[01:12:00]  Come on, brother man.  What's wrong with you?  Let us do this now.  I can't stand it.  Anthony took a three-day course.  A crash course.  He has no license.  Crash.  I shouldn't say crash.  But he has no license.  He doesn't know where the building is, yet he's flying the balloon.  Police helicopters are buzzing them, but he's not going back.  Come on, dude.  Get off us.  Bring it around, bro.  It's small up here, yet we have 10,000 full of liquid balloons. 
[01:12:30]  Now, before we drop them, let's get to the brand new Van Halen.  12 years ago.  12 effing years ago.  I cannot deal with Jimmy.  I knew this would happen with Jimmy.  We're running out of show.  We're running out of show.  Yes, of course I'm flying.  Keep him over the side.  Look at all the people staring at us, giving us the finger.  Yo, yo.  F-U-R-A-B-U.  We ain't two takes at you, mother hunkers. 
[01:13:00]  Oh.  All right.  I'm getting dizzy.  You're feeling a little woozy.  So many slogans, so little shirt space.  We hate you.  I was so hoping I'd be at a barn boss and someone would come up to me and go,  Hey, what's up, mother hunker?  Mother, I can't.  Mother hunker.  Hucker.  What's up, mother hunker?  No, they would have walked up and said, Hey, you're the mother hunker guy, 
[01:13:30]  and you would have said, Yeah.  And they would have said, I hate you.  You, we ain't two takes at you, mother hunkers.  Pops away.  Drop them, drop them.  I'm coming around again.  I'm coming around.  Coming around.  Hey, guys, from TV, take this.  Drop them off.  I am, dude.  I'm starting with the A's.  We're up to the B's.  Take this.  After the score, I'm surprised the Patriots didn't change your name.  Wait, you started with the A's and went to the B's?  No, you started with the Z's. 
[01:14:00]  This sounds like two retards playing in the park.  I don't know.  You love the hunkers.  Drop the balloons.  Oh, Bobby just put it right in perspective there.  Two retards in the park.  Just a retarded imagination gone wild.  You fly.  I dropped a balloon. 
[01:14:30]  Buddy, buddy.  Stop it.  Take this.  Oh, man.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Dude, sorry.  I wasn't meaning to hit you.  Come on, man.  I'm sorry.  All right, I'm getting out.  No, don't get out.  Bring it around again, dude.  You're too low, man.  Well, get us up higher.  Give us another blast.  Come on.  All right, they're coming around.  Get the D-cups.  All right.  Get the D-cups.  All right, dude.  Oh, my God.  I got the double D bra bop down. 
[01:15:00]  It's not turning.  Come on, dude.  All right, come on.  All right, we're lining up.  We're lining up.  These things are heavy.  Here they go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't.  Oh, my God.  I can't.  The overacting in that last scene.  Oh, my God.  Now, you hit a car, too?  Some collateral damage?  Yeah.  Yes, I'm glad you noticed that. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  We had hit a car.  Yeah.  The amazing thing is.  What, Jimmy?  What now?  I want to say, if we went door to door, not one person thought you were really up.  No one.  I'm surprised you didn't drop leaflets the day before.  To warn the people that this bit was going to be on the air.  At least Anthony wanted to get out.  No, they were too low.  That was why Anthony was piloting the thing.  He saw that there was some kind of problems, even though no one was shooting at them.  Right. 
[01:16:00]  Yet they were too low for whatever reason.  Even though they were throwing the heavy things off.  They were still losing out.  That's true.  What happened there?  I don't know.  We didn't want the slingshots to get us there, Jimmy.  Did you see that lady's face?  No.  I'm flying a blimp in midair.  I didn't.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, I saw her face.  I can't tell which building is which.  And yet I see the satellite dish.  And that lady's gold tooth.  What's the matter with you? 
[01:16:30]  How do you see everything and nothing?  What the hell is that?  Strange, worldly object.  Oh, helicopter.  Okay.  Jimmy, could you gnaw?  Oh, it's killing me.  Out of the building.  You're screwed.  Let's get the hell out of here, bro.  Let's get the hell out of here.  Oh, my God.  You see their faces?  Unreal.  Yeah.  High five, brother.  We are out of here.  We're about two blocks away. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, man.  What's up, bro?  Thanks, man.  Look at everyone waving to us.  Wait, wait.  Why are they waving now?  That mission completes?  Why are they waving?  I don't know.  Wait.  I don't know.  Because we just wanted to be liked.  Because it's our last day on the air.  People are waving goodbye.  Here it is.  I hope they try to land at Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Wait.  You were circling.  A second ago, they were giving you the finger.  And now you're leaving, and they're all waving and waving. 
[01:17:30]  I don't know.  And these two douches were sitting five feet away from each other in the studio.  F-ing dopes.  They were waving because the bit was over.  You know they were looking down at the floor, too, while they were in the studio?  Of course they were.  I want to move an altitude now, man.  We've got to get some out of here.  Yeah, play the hell out of there, man.  Oh, man.  What's up, brother?  Everyone's waving.  Look at that guy waving from his car, man. 
[01:18:00]  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll be back on the ground in a few minutes, man.  We are outing.  Missing.  I think it's fast.  Woo.  We are outing.  Did I say outing?  Outing.  Yeah.  What, the closet-y?  Just another one I thought would look good on a t-shirt.  I'm telling you, I was all about the catchphrase.  Oh, God.  Chris, Chris and Oklahoma City, it's World War Boo. 
[01:18:30]  And Jim F. from Philly, what were the balloons filled with?  Flop sweat?  There's a lot of screaming.  Let's say hi to-  Well, I think there was a lot of noise up there.  Very emotional moment.  I think there's wind.  There's the planes.  Yeah, thank you, Bob.  See, he knows.  And then you get the gas that shoots out.  The foliage. 
[01:19:00]  Yes, the leaves were changing.  People waving.  People giving their finger.  Nobody knows what to feel except me.  Nauseous.  Let's say hi to John in North Carolina.  John.  I am mortified, mortified.  John?  Hey, dudes.  I hope this mission ends in a kamikaze mission.  Yeah, right?  All right, and then we're on the ground, and I think this ends the bit here.  Oh, no, not more.  Before we get out of here.  Mission accomplished.  We just bombed WABU, bro.  Did you see the looks on their faces? 
[01:19:30]  No, we were in the studio.  There were guys standing out there, all these business guys in suits, with binoculars, looking  up at us.  Why, if you will love.  Don't we get the guys with the walkers?  Because everyone brings their binoculars to work.  They do.  And they need binoculars to see you, and yet you can see the middle finger from the clouds.  Yeah.  Notice that they have binoculars.  You know what makes this bit easier, Anthony?  You've got to make fun of yourself from 12 years ago.  I can't even listen to this.  That Opie from 12 years ago, what a douche.  Nah, he's outie now. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, boy.  He's outie.  That Opie, he's, whoa, whoa, watch out.  Don't know what he's going to do next.  I love the fact that you're painting them as the businessman, like the typical, like  I can't believe those businessmen in suits.  Why, you?  All those fuddy duddies.  That was the enemy, man.  Socius.  Corporate.  Socius.  Socius.  Right.  Killers looking up at us.  Well, don't forget the guys with the walkie-talkies.  And we were literally, it looked like close enough where they could reach up and get us, 
[01:20:30]  but they couldn't.  And it pissed them off.  That's why they needed binoculars to see you?  They could have almost reached up and grabbed you, so they wanted to look into your nostril  hair?  The inconsistencies here are just stunning.  I have to say it again.  I got to take it inside this whole thing.  I do not remember doing this.  I swear to you.  I forgot all about this until I found this tape.  I don't remember this.  Yeah, I don't remember being in a studio and recording this.  I don't remember this.  You're lucky that all of us. 
[01:21:00]  I remember our first April Fool's prank where we actually got hundreds of people to show  up at a club that didn't exist to see Pearl Jam.  I remember doing that one.  And that one got us in a lot of trouble, and it was way more believable than this crap.  I, uh, all right.  Put it, and it pissed them off.  There was another guy with binoculars.  We were like, dude, we're right above you.  You idiot.  The guy's looking like a mile away.  No, we're like 400 feet above you, man.  400 feet.  At one point, I got scared, man. 
[01:21:30]  I'm pulling on the propane trying to get us back up, and we were getting closer and closer  to the building.  And that's when you unloaded the D-cup.  Right.  Damn.  Yeah, if you're just tuning in, we just bombed W-A-B-U.  We had a little airstrike from above.  We had this, like, blimp-flat, uh, I don't know, hot air balloon, I guess you would call  it.  And we had these bra bombs, we're calling them.  They were water balloons attached with bras, and we just bombed everyone down there at  W-A-B-U.  We bombed the cars, the people.  We bombed that one postman.  I apologize, dude, if you're listening, man. 
[01:22:00]  We did not mean to hit you, I swear to you.  Why would he be listening?  He hit a postman.  We bombed his mail truck.  He was pissed, man.  We hit a milkman.  That was one of the funniest things I've ever been a part of, man.  Mission accomplished.  Yeah, that we survived.  I hope they have tape of that back at the station, because we're going to have to listen  to that to see how it sounded, because I have no clue, man.  When you play, you'll listen to it 12 years later.  Yeah.  Oh. 
[01:22:30]  And wish.  All right, listen.  I have to say one thing.  How old is he accepted?  One thing.  How the fuck?  No.  Easy there, chief.  How the, yeah, how the F did we make it in radio?  Well, we had the gumption to fly a blimp and throw balloons.  They were afraid to fire you.  They knew it would happen.  Oh, we'd attack them. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Be all over.  All right, well, Travis is in studio, because this will end the bit fine.  Travis.  You want the totals, or you want it split up between you and Ant?  Yeah, let's split them up.  All right.  Dudes.  Ten for Opie.  Three for Anthony.  All right.  I don't want much of a dude person.  Mans were split evenly.  Ten apiece.  Six bros for Opie.  Three for Anthony.  One pally.  That was for Anthony. 
[01:23:30]  Pally.  And as far as catchphrases go, two motherhuckers, one buddy boy, and three brother mans.  Nice.  What's the total on all those horrendous words?  20, 30, 33, 36, 37, 38.  About 50.  Oh, my God.  With the music better underneath.  All right.  Thank God.  Buddy boy.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony, coming up after the break. 
[01:24:00]  Sam, we delve into some new technology, calling a deaf operator.  Well, an operator for the deaf, who transcribes for the deaf, but the operator has to repeat  what is being said to her.  And, of course, Bob Kelly makes it gay.  Of course he does.  Stay tuned.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hi, I am Elok.  And I am primetime Sam Roberts from the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes, of course.  Uh, this bit here is called deaf operator.  Now, once in a while, we call that phone service, where, um, you speak to an operator. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, they'll translate what you're saying into that computer pulse machine that deaf  people can, uh, understand.  Well, it's done, yeah.  It's done for deaf people, where a deaf person can sit in front of the computer and watch the  text, uh, as an operator types it for you.  I believe that's how it works.  That's probably what it is.  But the way, the, the great thing about it is that the operator has to repeat what she's  typing for you.  Yeah, just to make sure that she's getting it correct.  Right.  So we had some fun, uh, believe it or not, there was some profanity involved. 
[01:25:00]  What?  We abused this service?  That's right.  So if you have little kids in the room, bring them around the radio.  But it wasn't just us this time.  Bob Kelly is also in studio for this.  Yes.  The great gay comedian, Bob Kelly.  Which wasn't far off because what did he do on the phone?  Surprise, surprise, it was gay.  Yes.  Unbelievable and hard to imagine.  Bob Kelly acts gay with the, uh, phone operator for the deaf people.  And here it is.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  And when this bit is done. 
[01:25:30]  Oh.  Go to Twitter, Robert Kelly fans.  Because why doesn't he have Robert Kelly live?  Because I screwed with his Twitter.  Yeah.  So go to Robert Kelly fans on Twitter.  And, uh, you know, tell him how much you appreciated this bit by saying, yeah, you really convinced  me for being gay.  Yes.  You really, Bob Kelly, today I know you are a gay man.  This sucks camel dicks.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  You're failure.  Fail.  You're failure.  I don't want to lose Gabe because he has the rules of what you can and can't do with deaf 
[01:26:00]  operators.  Gabe, what do you got?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, it was a little bit, it was a little bit out of control and whacking with you guys,  but every time you finish a comment or finish whatever you have to say, you have to tell  the relay operator, go ahead.  And that's how she knows to continue.  That's how she knows that your message is over.  Okay.  All right.  So you say, go ahead.  And you can say whatever you want.  A relay operator has to say whatever you guys, whatever you, she has to type down it  and relay the message to the deaf person.  Whatever you guys say, she has to say it. 
[01:26:30]  Or she risks the, she, she, she risks the chance of getting fired.  So anything that you tell her, you can say, cunt this, cunt that, but you can't involve  the relay operator.  And that's why you guys got booted.  And this is actually regulated by the FCC.  It's a government program.  So they might track your phone number down in.  Yeah.  Like we haven't had our run-ins with them.  Yeah, no kidding.  I guess they know you guys just a little bit.  Oh, can you, can you play a game on her?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:27:00]  Hello?  Hello.  Hello, this is operator 80274F with an IP relay call.  Do you know how to use relay?  Yes, I do.  Thank you.  Hi.  Thank you.  And.  Wait, what do you guys just say?

[01:29:00]  I'm waiting for James' response.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Don't sound gay, or I could find you in a trunk, correction, in a trunk, of the 800-horsepower-775 torque with good brakes. 
[01:29:30]  Go ahead.  I'm not sounding gay, I'm being honest.  I would like to kiss and bite your bush fat, and open your ass with my fingertips as far as I can, and glaze down the crack.

[01:32:00]  I've been thinking of a way to deal with my neighbor.  That sounds gay.  Go ahead.  One more, and please, the caller has interrupted.  Yes.  Give me free stuff for this.  Go ahead.  I would like when you, I like, excuse me, I'm sorry.  I like when you slowly suck on my earlobes and then slap your large cock off my cheek, inside

I'll slow down.  I don't apologize, but...  No, it's okay.  I get you.  I understand you.  Where are we?  Okay.  Where are we now?  However, sir, the caller has interrupted.  Okay.  Go ahead.  He says, he's the king.  I heard what was said, so I won't ask to ban the RO. 
[01:37:00]  It's an FCC violation to ask the relay operator for a head hold so I can piss.  Go ahead.  Okay, no.  I don't know what that means, but...  I love...  I love head, and I love cock, and I love ass, and I love yours, and I want you to put your  cock in my ass, and we could kiss after and make out with hard tongues.  Please, go ahead.  Oh, um, can you repeat that, please, sir, from...  I love him, and I love cock, and I love...

[01:41:00]  and that way it will taste better when I put it in my mouth.  I love pussy cock.  Go ahead.  Can you please repeat that from what I like to be pissed on?  But sometimes when you piss on me, you smell like peanut butter.  Old peanut butter.  Old peanut butter.  And I like it.

[01:42:00]  If I had to make a decision between you and the R.O., it could be the R.O., but only if she has 300 horsepower,  our WD manual is a plus.  No fatties.  That was nasty.  Did it really have to be old peanut butter?  Correction.  Old peanut butter.  Go ahead.  If we lie together, tummy to tummy, tip to tip, on my bed or maybe my hammock, 
[01:42:30]  I would love for us to come a little bit out of the tip of our penises  and let it dry in the sun until it sticks together  and then gently rip it apart as we make out with deep guy tongue  and pull each other's hair nipples and love asshole.  Over.  Go ahead.  Oh, one moment, please.

Lie together.  Lie together in a hammock in the sun, tummy to tummy, tip to tip,  to let some come out of the tips of our penises, let it dry in the sun.  And then make out with each other heavy, deep tongue kissing like real men should, 
[01:43:30]  angrily chipping teeth and gagging on each other's penises in the sun.  That's where I love you.  Go ahead.  Oh, um, can you please, please speak a bit slower so that I may type everything?  Yes, okay, okay.  Can you please repeat that from we lie together in a hammock in the sun  and tummy to tummy, tip to tip, to let the cum come out and dry in the sun 
[01:44:00]  so that we can rip it off with a heavy kiss  and then you can rest your balls on my cheek like old peaches.  Oh, um, can you repeat that, please, from that I'm coming out and dry in the sun

[01:45:00]  Thank you.  And the caller has interrupted.  Thank you.  Did anyone see the part in Jarhead just after the guy burning the shit fuck with the pussy that didn't do its job?  I want to do that to Jimmy Norton in front of his mother.  Would that turn you on?  Oh, Jesus.  Would it, Jimmy?  Go ahead.  Oh, he's so funny.  Oh, God.  Okay, pussy cunt, pussy cunt, dick cock, pussy cunt, ass cunt, pussy asshole, dirty dick cock.

[01:46:30]  Cock.  Go ahead.  The caller has interrupted.  Let Anthony do it.  He's the one with the slow cars.  Yo, the part, correction, yo, that part was funny.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Fucking say it, you pussy.  Go ahead.  I just came on my stomach.  I have to go.  Thank you for the fun talk.  I hope you came, too, on your hairy stomach, inside your belly button.

Can you please repeat that from my freebies?  Yes.  My freebies.  I love cock.  Cock.  I love cock.  Big cock.  Your cock.  Your cock is so big.  I love your cock.  Can you please repeat that from I love cock?  I love cock.  I love your cock.

[01:49:30]  he has sex with my ass?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  One moment, please.  The caller has just typed in, be like Howard.  He says he's the king.  Is that girl right?  Mitch, get me some tabs, you fucking bitch.  I said that without prejudice.  Go ahead. 
[01:50:00]  Deaf people stink.  Go ahead.  Can you repeat that, please, sir?  Over and out.  Roger Wilco.  Oh, my God.  That would have gone on forever.  Bobby, you did it.  Oh, my God.  You did it way too well.  That was really good.  Yeah, I know the part where I said, use my fingertips to spread your ass.  That kind of made me fucking, I was like, wow, what a faggot I am.  You were like, wow, where did that come from?  Where did that come from?  Where did, coming out of tip to tip and letting it dry in the sun. 
[01:50:30]  That's either from some kind of experience or you read it somewhere or so.  I mean, you just, or you dream about it on every afternoon.  You just don't come up with that, Bobby.  Hey, this is Robert Kelly and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with Sam and E-Rock.  Sam, after the break.  Rich Voss versus Mike Birbiglia.  That's right.  We had JBL and Roland somehow, for some reason, our former talent booker in studio, and JBL, 
[01:51:00]  of course, former WWE superstar.  They were all there as Voss and Birbiglia, two comedians that are friends of the show,  completely broke down their relationship.  It was great.  I love it.  I love a fight.  Stay tuned.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony with E-Rock and Sam.  We're from the Opie and Anthony show, but you know that already because you're listening.  And this bit involves, no, we get some good fights once in a while.  Oh, yeah.  This one was pretty heated.  It's Rich Voss versus Mike Birbiglia, but the great JBL is in studio, and somehow Roland 
[01:51:30]  works his way into this.  Well, Roland gets mad because it turns into a Roland and Voss fight at one point.  JBL, former WWE superstar, is in studio just enjoying all the madness.  But the thing is, there's a real hatred between Mike Birbiglia and Rich Voss.  I think Voss just thinks he's kind of hacky.  Yeah.  And I think, in a way, Voss resents Mike Birbiglia's success.  He's at a one-man show and all this stuff. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  I think he also put it, it's a comedian that women like.  Yes.  And Birbiglia just thinks Voss is an idiot.  So, we all do.  That's where that is.  And also, JBL's there.  JBL rules.  Pushing his boner juice or his slowing his roll.  I believe this might be the day that he gave me his hat.  Oh, that's right.  What an awesome birthday present.  It really was great.  Thank you to the WWE.  Here it is.  Mike Birbiglia versus Rich Voss with JBL and Roland in studio on the worst of the Opie and 
[01:52:30]  Anthony show.  You're listening to the worst.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  No, not at all.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, because it's a piece of shit.  What do you play Scrabble with?  My shelf on the computer.  Nah is a word.  N-A is a word.  You play computer with yourself.  Well, people say his voice is good.  Nah.  Nah.  How are you going to challenge it without the addiction?  All right.  I got it.  Hey, could you move that bottle and the soda can there in front of Jimmy? 
[01:53:00]  Are we challenging Nah?  No.  All right.  Thanks.  Thank you, Mike.  And that purple fag fucking elixir that is.  What is this shit?  Oh, well, better not say anything about it.  He's right outside the door.  JBL, come on in.  Anthony wants to know what this shit is.  This is a good introduction for JBL.  JBL, Anthony.  Perhaps I shouldn't have said, what is this shit?  Anthony just said, what is this shit?  As he's looking at your fine product, sir.  No, no. 
[01:53:30]  I was looking at the, holy Jesus, what did I do?  Didn't he used to pitch for the Orioles?  Oh, my God.  What did I do?  What are you talking about?  I don't like you said.  You think he looks like Jim Palmer?  Yeah.  You don't think so?  Jim Palmer's old, bro.  Oh, he looks like a young Jim Palmer.  Good looking man.  Well, here's how age works.  Eventually, when you age, you're not the same person.  Yeah.  And why has my drink got to be gay?  What is it?  Well, oh, oh.  Well, can we play back what Ant just said, now that JBL's in the studio? 
[01:54:00]  Oh, thanks.  You're going to play it back.  Well, because JBL, he didn't say it was gay.  Hi.  He said, what is this shit?  I think the exact quote was, what is this shit?  I don't think I said that.  I don't think I said that at all.  We're going to find it.  It's an anti-energy drink.  Yes, Frank.  It's Mike's act in a can.  Anti-  Oh, fuck.  JBL from the WWE, Jimmy is going to explain what's going on here.  That's Rich Voss.  I'm Jim Norton, as I'm hoping you know. 
[01:54:30]  And this is Mike Perviglia.  And these two have been going out.  Relax your mind, body, and soul.  What a great idea.  There's so many energy drinks out there.  This is the anti-energy drink.  Yeah, nice save.  So it'll mellow you out.  But there was a reference about the packaging being a little bit non-heterosexual.  I don't think there was.  This is what Anthony had to say about JBL, not knowing JBL was outside the studio, and  that the boys gave us all one of these drinks to enjoy before JBL came in here today.  Thank you, Mike. 
[01:55:00]  And that purple fag fucking elixir that is.  What is this shit?  Why?  Why, Anthony?  It couldn't be more horrendous.  He's here to promote his product, not have it destroyed before it even hits the market.  This was a misunderstanding, sir.  I want you to know that I had no clue, because of this unique packaging, that it was your product. 
[01:55:30]  I did not know it was turned away, and all I saw was a purplish color, which is indicative  to perhaps some people in the gay community appreciate this color more so than other people.  Anthony goes to his white guy voice, his black comedian's white guy voice.  Thank you.  Well, sir, actually, because of the purple packaging.  That's what I thought.  I would never really honestly think this was shit.  I don't think so.  Nor would I think it was a fag concoction or elixir. 
[01:56:00]  I'm not sure JBL's headphones were working properly.  I want to make sure JBL hears this once again from about 10 minutes ago.  And that purple fag fucking elixir that is.  What is this shit?  This can should be coming out of some gay guy's ass.  It's going to be coming out of mine, I think.  You're playing Scrabble at 9.30 in the morning, and you're calling my drink gay?  Exactly.  These two fruits are playing Scrabble. 
[01:56:30]  Please, I'm trying to just usher it off.  Spell homo.  R-I-C-H.  I got it.  Thanks.  I liked it.  I didn't know JBL was coming in today, and so for a split second I thought he was the  homeless guy you guys were talking about.  That is a well-dressed, handsome homeless man, isn't he?  He did well for the Orioles back in the day.  Very much.  Yeah, but I thought it was like a Horatio Alger.  You kind of pick him up by his bootstraps.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:57:00]  Bring him off the street.  And watch him just screw up again.  Can I get a fucking vowel?  What?  Oh.  Oh, what happened?  Nothing.  Jimmy can't get a vowel.  He can't make a word.  You had a pass, Jimmy?  No, I took it.  What'd you make?  I put toll, T-O-L-L-F-4.  You got four points.  Toll.  Oh, yeah, T-O-L-L.  All right.  Rich, you got a question for JBL and his awesome drink, Drank?  It's called Drank.  It's anti-energy.  Do I have a question for him?  Yeah.  What would you do with these letters?  Keep them up. 
[01:57:30]  That is damn funny.  Oh, I have a question for him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's a good...  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  What am I going to do?  I'm trying to do, you know...  I sure got off on the wrong foot.  What does it stand for, JBL?  Unforgiven?  Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  That's what his name means?  No.  It's the name of a pay-per-view coming up where there's a world championship match, which I'm in,  against CM Punk, who is our drug-free champion, who says he doesn't drink or smoke. 
[01:58:00]  He calls it healthy.  I call that boring.  Ah.  Hit, Michael.  Have another one-man show in a month.  That's probably true.  See, he's doing a sleep-walking show.  They're jabbing each other.  Just going at it.  And it's uncomfortable.  JBL, what do you recommend as far as investing in this climate that we're in right now?  The problem is the financials.  They still haven't completely unfolded yet.  House prices still have to come down. 
[01:58:30]  Banks aren't loaning money, so credit is deteriorating rapidly.  So, any type of renewable energy is pretty big.  Renewable energy, as in?  Wind, solar.  Wind power.  Yeah, solar, wind.  Wind, solar are going to be huge.  Turbines, yeah.  Nuclear.  My account has me in lead hats.  He said, buy lead hats.  Keep the heat on your head.  It's like a Woody Allen joke.  Now, JBL, I've noticed, and this might be...  My investor has me in lead hats.  31. 
[01:59:00]  This might be...  But I've noticed a resurgence in my area of new construction again, which was really just dead.  Houses were sitting there half-built.  Could this be a sign that maybe the housing market is coming back?  It's turning around, yes.  It could be a sign that it's not completely dead.  Unfortunately, housing prices...  Banks aren't loaning money.  80% of loans were securitized from 2001 until now.  That's not happening.  So, you don't have a market for these loans to go to.  So, because of supply and demand, that's probably going to drive house prices down further. 
[01:59:30]  But you are seeing...  Bastards.  Yeah.  Bearer of bad news.  You are seeing some resurgence in a lot of parts of the world.  Good.  Because, you know something?  I think I bought exactly at the wrong time, just like everything else I do when I'm investing.  Yeah, the same thing.  Holy Jesus.  $10,000 into like $320.  Yeah.  It's just amazing how badly you can screw up on your own.  I tell you what, if Obama gets elected, you can get into a home, and if you can't pay your mortgage, he'll bail you out. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, apparently so.  You're bailing out everybody else.  With money from the people, the taxpayers.  I would assume you're like a McCain guy there, JBL.  I'm pretty much an independent.  I don't like Obama's redistribution of wealth, which is what I think is.  I think it's pathetic.  I mean, these guys, you don't legislate ignorance.  These people are too stupid to know they can't afford these homes.  Rich is talking about you.  That's bad, but you can't bail these guys out.  Not with taxpayers' money.  Thank you.  Although, my only debate with that would be that we do kind of bail out banks, 
[02:00:30]  and we do forgive foreign debt.  It's true.  Like, what bothers me, and I'm not a redistribute-the-wealth guy at all,  but I am disgusted with the way if we need something in the U.N.,  we'll forgive $10 billion in debt for some shit nation just to get them to do what we want,  but yet people here are getting paid.  Are you going to call Marx?  What else you got to say?  I'm only saying there are better ways to, I think, to.  But there are people who make a lot of shitty decisions, but the banks always get bailed out.  Not to mention you want a president who's going to work towards not exporting jobs. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  I mean, and building industry at home because we're losing our middle class.  Yeah, we are.  The main thing you've got to do, though, is lower the corporate tax rate.  Thank you.  So that rich people make more money and they don't pay their employees that well and give them health insurance?  So that businesses can afford to be here.  They lowered the corporate tax rate in Ireland, and they went from 14% unemployment down to 4%.  I'm not talking about lowering on specific individuals.  I'm talking about lowering on businesses.  You know, on businesses, they can hire more people.  If you raise corporate taxes, they have to make their money up somewhere. 
[02:01:30]  They're going to let people go.  And then the taxpayers, it's supposed to be saddled with health care?  Yeah.  Sorry.  You know something?  There's no guarantee.  I keep saying this country wasn't based on a guarantee of prosperity.  You have a chance to be prosperous in this country.  But there's no fucking guarantee that you're going to have health care and have a great job and be able to do it. 
[02:02:00]  It's a chance.  It's some part luck.  It's part talent, skill, hard work, whatever it is.  I don't know why everybody assumed all of a sudden that this country is this place where you come and you're guaranteed to be taken care of.  It just doesn't.  No.  It doesn't work that way.  Some people are going to be fucking left out in the cold.  Sorry.  Go to fucking Canada.  They're all crazy up there anyway.  It's all bullshit, their health care.  You sit in a waiting room there for two days. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Oh, all their free health care you hear about in Canada.  Yeah, you sit there.  For two, three days.  There's got to be a balance.  Yeah.  There's got to be a balance between...  You're right.  You don't see six armed kids being flown to Canada to have their arms chopped off.  Absolutely.  They come here to the old US of A.  But there's got to be a balance between that and some people who really just can't get shit they need.  That is, I'm not saying you fucking give it all away, but you can't, you can't.  It's redistribution of wealth, just like Mr. JBL said.  The company can't, the country can't adopt you. 
[02:03:00]  I mean, at some point, you've got to be on your own.  Sure.  And I'm against these bailouts of these companies.  I mean, you've got Goldman Sachs down here.  That is a fantastic company.  They don't get any money.  But all of a sudden, you have Bear Stearns turn into just a disaster, and the government backs them to $30 billion.  It's just, we're legislating ignorance, and we're backing bad business decisions, which is contrary to the American way.  It's what works in Sherwood Forest, but doesn't work here.  And I'll tell you another thing about health care.  You've got somebody like Tippy Tom.  Do you think he's got fucking insurance? 
[02:03:30]  He spent time in the hospital getting his legs taken care of.  You could walk into an emergency room in this country and get taken care of.  When you're that bad, you can.  Of course you can.  But to prevent yourself from getting that, and I'm not talking about people that abuse the system, but he has to basically be having his leg needing amputation.  Well, that's because he's stupid.  Yeah, and plus he drinks a lot, and he shits his pants.  I'm not saying there's not issues with Tom's side either.  I'm saying Tom's responsible.  Yeah, but what is health care of right?  I just think we could stand to have someone in the White House who's looking to create prosperity versus sitting on our prosperity, which is what our president does now. 
[02:04:00]  He's in the last eight years.  He's basically because he's in bed with all the oil companies, and he went to a war for oil, and that's all.  I don't see it as a war for oil.  I see it as a war for bullshit.  But as far as the ‚Äì I think it's more of a war for this guy wanted my daddy dead, so I'm going to hang him, have him hung.  Two trillion dollars, three trillion dollars. 
[02:04:30]  But nothing's gotten done.  That hurts more than anything.  Oh, absolutely.  I'll agree with that.  I'm not a big fan of George W. Bush, that's for sure.  The guy, he hasn't done ‚Äì most presidents you see every so often they sit down in the White House, and they're signing things, you know, working.  And they get their pens out.  They hand the pens out.  They sign bills.  I remember seeing Clinton doing that all the time.  He was just signing stuff.  But George W., I haven't seen him.  He hasn't done shit as far as ‚Äì  He's good at fly fishing.  In fairness, to sign something, you've got to be able to read.  And I'm not sure, President. 
[02:05:00]  Don't talk about Rich Voss.  This isn't about the war.  This is about spending.  The problem is spending.  But spending $3 trillion on a war puts us in debt, and it makes our money worth last around the world.  You're talking about spending several hundred billion dollars a year, which is too much.  I agree with that.  But the problem is you've got to take it out somewhere.  No matter the justification of the war or not, put that aside.  You've got to take it out somewhere.  And these guys are spending like they have the money to do it, and they don't. 
[02:05:30]  You had $100,000 in the last Iraqi war bill for a Punxsutawney film museum.  Well, you can talk about pork barrel stuff all day.  You can have kind of incidents all day.  That's not a real argument.  No, it's a huge argument.  No, no, no.  Bullshit.  Isolated examples are not an argument.  Bullshit.  These assholes would be in jail if they were in the private enterprise.  These congressmen would be in jail if they did that in private enterprise.  But they're doing it here, and they're getting away with it. 
[02:06:00]  So it's not.  Yeah.  It's not something.  Absolutely.  I completely agree with you.  But status quo sucks.  Yeah.  But you know what?  When Clinton came into office, we were $2 trillion in debt.  And everybody says no one could balance the budget.  And he tried.  And he did.  And we ended up with a surplus.  Decimating.  He cut back on military.  Military.  CIA.  Intelligence.  Yes.  You know, they shrug off.  There were more attacks on American soil and on Americans during his administration than any other administration. 
[02:06:30]  On American soil is only one.  Well, I mean, on Americans and American soil.  Rich, if we know anything from 9-11, it's that they planned these things for 10, 11 years before they even happened.  And that's why this argument is so bogus when they say, we haven't been attacked the last seven years.  Yeah, they're working on it for 0-12, assholes.  Well, who is it, Mike?  What do you mean?  Tell us.  Oh, bullshit.  So they're that smart that they're sitting around. 
[02:07:00]  They're just planning because they're that much smarter than us.  Did you follow the 9-11 investigations at all?  Wait, but do you know how many attacks have been deterred since Bush has been in office?  I don't know.  17.  How many, Rich?  Well, we know at least Seattle.  Yes, there were.  Throughout the world, in Italy, Spain, there has been trains blown up.  People killed all over the world from Arab extremists.  It's not happening in this country now.  Why?  Because Bush put money in defense. 
[02:07:30]  Clinton took away money from defense.  He knocked down the CIA.  Bush brought it back.  See, so we're a little safer with him in office.  I don't know.  There you go.  Let's get back to Scrabble.  I'll agree with that last part when you said, I don't know.  Who's winning in Scrabble?  I'm up.  Well, we're taking a break.  I can't concentrate.  I'm getting all fucking consonants.  It's 181 me, 72 him.  Wow.  I thought you were beating me by more.  Wow.  Rich Voss is kicking your ass in Scrabble? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Well, give me the, I had, at one point, at one point, I had two I's and two fucking V's.  And right now, you have excuses.  Jesus.  I heard you.  It's the new wireless service.  V, V.  Richard have a harder time playing the child of a certain candidate.  I can't believe, I can't believe I'm losing a political argument to a fake wrestler.  Oh, J.B.  Oh, J.B. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, J.B.  Oh, did you hear that?  Now he's going to have to show you a fake move.  Time for a fake move.  That'll give you a real concussion.  Let's vote on the fake move.  Let's vote on the fake move.  Show you how bad your columnistic views are.  You're losing to me.  Hold on.  Can we please get a, you know, his driver wants to say something.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Rich Voss, no.  No, you did.  No, you did.  Go ahead.  Wow.  You said the fake wrestler.  You know, he's.  Yeah, I said the fake wrestler.  Yeah, you did. 
[02:09:00]  But the thing is, he gets paid to be booed.  You got booed off stage at the violin show.  Oh, no.  You got it yourself.  I got paid.  No, you didn't.  Thank you.  Oh, the humanity.  No, you didn't.  I got paid very well, actually.  My driver just hammered you.  Oh, that's pretty good.  I get paid to booed.  I get paid to be cheered.  This guy knows everything about the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, that's nice.  Everything.  He's in the car all day.  Yes, I know.  Joe Village.  Yeah, I know.  Watch what Joe could do.  Obscure O.P. and Anthony knowledge right now. 
[02:09:30]  You can work around the room if you want.  What do you got?  Don't talk to me.  I'm too sleepy for my beverage.  It's a delicious, relaxing beverage, isn't it?  It's not a great packaging.  Well, Jimmy just had nose surgery.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hopefully, he's doing better.  I'm trying to have it made bigger so I can do well in show business.  That was a Jew joke.  Oh, really?  Thank you.  Sam's birthday coming up on Saturday.  24 years old, I believe.  25?  25? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  You're like little cherubish little kids still.  Anthelini going strong.  Really?  JBL.  I think.  Maybe you need an update?  JBL.  JBL, your assistant seems so smart.  Do you see him filling your shoes?  Okay.  I may.  Not a lesson?  Yeah, with Goya beans.  And when is your parole up?  That's cute.  That's not cute.  All right?  That's cute.  He's learned a few things from hanging out with the wrestling guys. 
[02:10:30]  He could kick your ass.  I'm sure he could.  I know he's a fucking boxer, stupid.  Joe is a boxer.  He's a boxer.  No, he's got a box cutter.  Oh.  What was that?  Wow.  Was it bad?  Wait, hold on a second.  Is it bad?  Shut up.  Just because his skin is a mild tint?  Yeah, that's what you mean?  Yeah, it was a stereotype, stupid.  Oh, okay.  Believe me, I don't disagree.  You know, the lighter you get, the more honest you get.  But he's a boxer.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm sure he is.  Show him one of your karate moves. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, show him a karate move, Rich.  Show him that kick.  I don't want to do anything.  I got a bad kidney.  I'm not going to get my ass kicked by a guy who has nothing to lose.  I'm going to say spar.  Just do a little.  I'm not going to fight each other doing some kind of karate thing.  What do you want to do?  You want me to do a good kick?  Yeah, yeah.  JBL, watch this.  Watch this.  Here he goes.  Watch, watch, Joe.  What are you doing?  Wow.  You couldn't even see that.  Look at Master Pose looking at your technique, too.  You want your side kick?  Yeah, side kick.  Don't kick by his face.  That's okay.  His legs are too short to reach, man. 
[02:11:30]  Oh!  That's why you couldn't see those little tiny gnat feet.  Is it weird to be in a building that's not boarded up?  I don't get it.  Nothing.  Oh, come on.  Let's keep playing.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't want to bail out of that one.  I'm going back to Scrabble.  Those weren't bad kicks.  Were those bad kicks, Poe?  They were okay.  They were okay.  For a guy that doesn't work out, doing karate, 51 years old.  Stop giving yourself different asterisks.  You look...  For a guy that was once attacked in an alleyway that had hurt, they'd break me. 
[02:12:00]  The only way you can get more boring is if you had a whole can of drank.  Rich Moss looks like a level one villain in an action game.  He looks like Glass Joe or like...  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I'm just trying to do some comedy.  I don't have a good example, though.  Keep trying.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:12:30]  Horrific.  We agree for once.  We do agree.  We do agree.  I own the building.  You rent.  Let's go.  Oh.  Is that a Jew joke?  Yes, I don't know.  That's good.  Why am I going after him?  I like the guy.  I don't have any problems with you.  Everyone's sparring today because Voss has childhood issues.  He does.  Yeah, I slept walk as a kid.  Why are we talking to me, though?  JBL's here.  Exactly.  Because he's as boring as a hangnail. 
[02:13:00]  You seem pretty exciting.  Holy shit.  Hangnails are fascinating, Rich.  They're really...  Maybe we're all sparring.  You're playing Scrabble on the radio, and you're calling me boring?  Oh, that's right.  He was giving in...  I'm losing to a guy who got booed out of the comedy club.  No, he's not...  Comedy club.  It wasn't a comedy club.  It was a theater.  Outdoor theater.  It wasn't a theater either, dumb fuck number two.  Oh, shit.  It was a fucking outdoor arena.  That's right.  Fuck.  Theater, outdoor arena.  It was like 10,000 people. 
[02:13:30]  Some say 11 or 12.  It was only 10,000.  Am I going to die after the show today?  Am I going to get killed?  Why are you going on stage?  I'm at the chart room in Sterling, Massachusetts.  Why don't you just say how many points?  17.  Whoa.  You're getting better.  Yeah, JBL comes in, gives us some great information on the economy and stuff and politics, and  you call them boring.  That's great, Rich. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, wonderful, Rich.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Sam and E-Rock are your hosts.  Sam, after the break, we're going into part two of Rich Voss versus Mike Birbiglia.  This thing just keeps going.  If you liked part one, then obviously you'll like part two because it's more of that.  And if you didn't like part one, you'll like part two because it's a little better.  Stay tuned.  Well put.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I have a question for JBL.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Have you ever?  No.  All right.  I won't ask it. 
[02:14:30]  No, go ahead, Mike.  No, Mike.  Please.  All right.  Someone's got to ask the question.  Some of us don't have a drink to drink.  This isn't insulting because I think the WWE stuff is great.  Have you ever considered like a real wrestling?  Like Olympic wrestling?  Actually.  Oh, yeah.  At 95.  Yeah, at 95.  No, no.  I'm too old.  We actually had a tournament in the WWE years ago.  It was a legit straight up tournament.  It was a hybrid tournament between boxing and wrestling, and I was in that.  Wow.  Made it to the finals and made a bad mistake. 
[02:15:00]  I fought sober and got caught by a left hook by Bart Gunn.  I'm going to say that was a good question then.  I forgot about that.  I remember that one.  I forgot about that.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I remember that one.  Wow.  Rocked.  That's when Vince was losing his mind, man.  Yeah.  I want people to beat the shit out of each other.  That's right.  Start punching each other for real.  I forgot about that.  They went legit for a while with the boxing and everything.  It's the brawl for all.  Yeah.  The brawl for all. 
[02:15:30]  The brawl for all.  Butterbean part of that.  He knows everything.  Well, Butterbean came in at like WrestleMania, I think, 15 to fight Bart Gunn after the brawl  for all.  Right, right, right.  Ah.  How did that end up?  He rocked.  He rocked him.  Butterbean won the fight.  Butterbean.  Yeah.  Big fucking volcano looking guy.  He's like a little fat broad groupie.  Look at you.  You're like a little fat bitch after a reality show.  Look at him.  We got any wrestling questions out there on the bleachers?  Oh, my God.  You know what?  I was in a beer drinking contest one time on Pay Per View and Stone Cold Steve Austin  broke my nose.  For real?  Yeah.  In a beer drinking contest?  In a beer drinking contest.  What happened? 
[02:16:00]  You were winning?  No, he went to throw a pitcher of beer in my face.  It was glass and it slipped out of his hand and hit me in the nose and broke my nose.  Holy shit.  Wow.  In a beer drinking contest.  I had a broken back.  He had a broken neck.  They told us no physicality.  No matter what happens.  And he breaks your nose.  And he breaks my nose.  I feel like that's what's going to accidentally happen to me after this interview.  Yeah.  Oops.  And a can of this goes flying at your face.  I sent Steve a picture the other day.  Steve went to Michigan recently and apparently he shot every deer in Michigan because he sent  me all these big bug pictures. 
[02:16:30]  And I was down in Texas and I had an opossum in my garage and I shot it and I sent him a  picture of it because that was about the biggest thing I've ever shot.  An opossum?  An opossum.  What did you shoot him with?  22.  Oh, okay.  Jesus, that story's like a verbal scrabble game.  Nobody cares.  The guy.  What?  JBL knowledge.  Look how close you are.  Look him in the face when you say that.  I would just love to hear the next thing out of Rich is this.  I think all the air leaves his lungs.  Every time Rich speaks, we should go to commercial.  I don't know. 
[02:17:00]  Say, Rich.  That was good, Mike.  You used that one already.  I'm trying to get punched in the teeth so I don't have to pay the $30,000.  I'll punch in the teeth.  Really?  You won't sue me, though?  Yeah, I don't want to spend the $30,000.  Yeah, he's not going to sue?  What rhymes with sue?  Why don't you say it to JBL instead of looking off to the side as you say it?  I'm not saying anything.  Look right into his eye.  Look right?  Huh?  Let's say that.  Say what?  What you were saying.  You were trashing him.  I'm a big fan.  Good luck with the soda pop. 
[02:17:30]  Soda pop.  With the sleepy soda.  Good luck with your soda pop, son.  I think you've got a future in this.  I'm a big fan.  You know what?  I'm just trying to do this and this.  I'm sorry.  Wait, wait.  Why are you a big fan of JBL?  Because he's, one, he's conservative.  That's one.  Okay.  Two, he's, he's, uh, he's a businessman.  He goes after something.  You wanted to say entrepreneur, didn't you?  Yeah. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, God.  I can tell.  Because he's not, you know, he hires minorities.  He's everything that this country wants.  He's everything.  Joe's sticking to Mike.  It takes you so long to get out of thought.  And when you get out, the thought, I'm like, it took that long for that thought?  Hey, I'm not a minority.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not a loan officer either.  I'm actually Italian.  That was good.  What?  So I'm not a loan officer either.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah, I am.  You're getting fake laughs by the bouncer, by the way, boss.  I could actually probably do that Bronx Tale scene a lot better than you did.  Oh.  By the way, I don't know, with those cocktail frying fingers, how do you pick up the letters?  Oh.  How do I pick up the letters?  Yes.  Now, when you're going with traffic to the east side.  Are you making fun of the fact that he's driving Jimmy?  No, there's nothing wrong with that.  I was feeling good about myself because I trashed Voss earlier, but then the driver trashes him. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's good, too.  Oh, you really got me earlier.  Boy, you've owed me 20 bucks for two months.  What do I do?  We're going to go to commercial, but definitely pick up drank, and we'll be back in a few minutes.  Oh, no, I'm not at this.  Unforgiven?  Yes, his political issues are enough for me to be on his side.  Like that.  That's all.  And obviously, from the hunting store, you're a gun owner.  You like, what, target shooting?  Well, no.  I'm not talking to you.  I believe in guns.  I'm not talking to you.  No, I like target JBL. 
[02:19:30]  I say I like shooting more than I like hunting.  Yeah, that's exactly what I am.  I'm not like a hunter.  I don't like hunting, but I love shooting.  Love shooting.  You have to leave the house.  Yeah, you know, I leave the house when I go.  I go down to the range.  I don't like going to the range.  What state are you from?  Texas.  Texas.  Oh, fuck, you lucky bastard.  You can just go into a drugstore and buy a gun.  You know what we got to go through in New York?  It's a pain in the ass.  Pain in the ass.  But, you know, we can carry concealed.  Anthony, there's one more thing we want to do with JBL as we promote his anti-energy drink. 
[02:20:00]  That's called drank.  I love the packaging.  I love the product.  I love the idea behind it.  What would you say the sexual orientation of the packaging would be?  If you were going to go one way or the other.  I would say a fag.  Okay.  And no, absolutely not.  It's a calming color.  That's what I've noticed.  You might want to pour it into a cup.  You don't want to be caught, what, carrying the can around?  Yeah, you might have poured in a cup because the color is calming.  It makes you want to just lay your head on a pillow, perhaps face first, but it will 
[02:20:30]  make you sleepy.  This is the color they paint bathhouses with.  How would you know that, Rich?  I couldn't let the mic in my face fast enough.  Why would you do that to yourself?  How would you know that?  That's a good one, Rich.  This tastes just like cum, but I'm not a loose knife.  Smooth, Rich, smooth.  Could you pour it through a hole in one of the stall walls?  By the way, Rich Ross will be at the Orange Julius in Worcester, Massachusetts this weekend.  I want to tell JBL, this is the new thing, anti-promotion. 
[02:21:00]  So this is going to work for your product, I'm telling you.  Trust us on this one.  Anti-promotion, anti-energy, I like it.  The gay wrestling move, Sam.  I think we should play the real gay one for JBL and get his opinion.  We've noticed that some of the finishing moves are a bit gay.  And we made Sam come up with the top five.  Top five gay finishing moves.  Maybe we should ask JBL.  He's been wrestling a long time.  What's one of the gayer moves where you're like, eh?  I don't like that one being used on me.  I don't like this one too much. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Stink face.  The stink face was, yeah, it was bad.  That was pretty bad.  That's bad.  Especially from what the ass it came from.  Yeah, that's a pretty awful move.  That was where a guy would be in the corner.  Pretty much knocked out.  You're talking about Rikishi who had like a three-ton ass.  Yeah, so the victim is in the corner, pretty much groggy, almost knocked out.  And then Rashiki, with a huge giant ass, would come over and just put the guy's face in the  crack of his ass and smear it around. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Michael looked over at JBL like, what the fuck are you?  That's gay and experimental.  Yeah.  Is this the gayest one, Sam?  Yeah, I think this is number one.  Yeah, JBL.  Do you know these wrestlers?  No, I do not.  They wrestle overseas, Sam?  Yeah, they're from Japan.  I think the guy's name is Dan Shoku Dino.  And this is his Dan Shoku driver.  Do you want to see him, JBL?  Dan Shoku driver.  We'll explain after JBL sees.  All right. 
[02:22:30]  He's pulling his...  I see he pulled...  So he's pulled down his pants.  And he's coming at him cock first.  Yeah, cock first.  He's got a gold thong stood on.  And his ass is showing.  And then he shoves his gold thong right into the guy's face.  He's cock first.  That's not all, JBL.  Then he opens up the G-string, puts the guy's head in.  He puts his head in.  And then power drives his head to the mat.  And does a little pile driver there.  It's a...  A pile driver.  And then he pins him with his dick on his face. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, JBL is stupefied.  Now, JBL, I know you love wrestling, but if Vince McMahon came to you and said,  I got a good idea.  I got some finishing moves I've been watching in Japan.  That I want to try on you in my office.  That would have...  Yeah, that...  How quickly would you leave wrestling if they told you to do that move?  Pretty quick.  As in right then.  Yeah.  All right.  I got all you wrestlers together to tell you,  it's boners in the mouth for all of you. 
[02:23:30]  That's right.  Boners in your mouth.  Every finishing move has to consist of a boner in your mouth.  Wrestling's like trying to...  It's like being a coke addict.  What does that mean?  All right.  Stop the music.  Stop the show.  Stop everything.  Stop the earth.  Stop the bit.  What was that?  What does that mean?  First of all, what's a coke addict?  The top of the house that snores cocaine?  A coke addict.  Can you please go already? 
[02:24:00]  And Frank hit in the attic.  I'm just trying to figure out a better one.  Hey, Mike...  Sorry.  A little late.  I'll crash myself.  I knew what you said.  It's okay.  And I won't say it again.  Mike in Cleveland has a very good observation about the show today.  Does he?  Yes.  Yeah.  How are you guys doing today?  Good.  You know, Oprah's talking about anti-promotions.  Rich has got the brand new kind of comedy, anti-humor.  Oh, Rich.  Oh, got me.  Rubber glue.  Got me. 
[02:24:30]  Anti-humor.  Whoa.  Wow.  Who's writing for you?  Babiglia?  Oh, why?  You have to bring it back to him.  Oh, stop it.  Just...  Mike's been behaving for 45 seconds.  No, he hasn't yet.  Jesus.  It's not 45 seconds.  Fucking double agent.  Jesus.  It's my job, you idiot.  Obi is what they call a shit-stirer.  He doesn't take sides.  He stirs the shit.  I get a new shit paddle every day.  I love this, though, as a trend.  I think we should have more callers defeat Voss.  Yeah.  Is Roland here?  I want proper promotion for this drink drink. 
[02:25:00]  By Roland, David?  Yeah, Roland will give you a fine promotion there, JBL.  You watch this.  Here comes Roland.  Joe, you know who Roland is, right?  Yes.  What can you tell people about...  I do know Roland.  I don't watch wrestling.  You don't watch wrestling?  No, I've never seen that.  All right, well, I want you to promote this drink of JBL's.  It's called Drake.  Roland, I've never seen you either.  So we're even.  Roland is...  Roland, I want you to try to.  Roland books a lot of our guests.  He's a very sweaty guy. 
[02:25:30]  I want you to try it, Roland.  What do you think?  All right, he's trying the drink.  He does the typical...  I don't think he needs anything to slow him down, though.  All right.  Oh, Jesus.  What's that, Rich?  No, I'm just saying his face.  You're a calm guy.  I'm just saying you don't need anything to slow you down.  You don't want to get on...  He's shitting you.  You don't want to get on his bad side.  No, you don't want to fucking get on his bad side.  You don't want to get on his bad side.  Really?  Not bad.  Yeah.  It's taking me a week to get to the other bad side.  Rich Voss, you can see him on Letterman. 
[02:26:00]  No.  Leno, no.  Kimmel, no.  You might be able to see him on QVC.  No.  Wait, CW11, the shit channel.  I'll see you on.  That was good.  Go fuck yourself.  Go team, motherfucker.  Oh, God.  You're the only tan Jew in the world.  All Jews are tan.  Oh, I'm rich.  Go fuck yourself.  Holy shit.  Any more fat jokes? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, man.  You can't trance how I talk every day I'm in here.  That bothers you?  That really bothers you?  Yes, sir.  Then get on the fucking treadmill, stupid.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Treadmill.  Oh, a treadmill.  Treadmill.  Let me go check my pinky bank, Rich Voss's bank account.  Oh, really?  My bank account?  Look at Spider-Go.  I've been around for eight years.  So fucking what?  Do something for eight years.  Don't get it.  Make it count.  Don't get a real cast.  Don't get a real cast.  Been on there for four years.  All right.  $20 million.  Get somebody that's real. 
[02:27:00]  Do something.  Go to the phone and go to your cubicle and get somebody that's real.  I do.  Okay, good.  Then do it.  At this point, Voss is holding his microphone that's already suspended in the air.  All right?  Wait, you get a...  Oh, oh.  You know what?  Uh-oh.  This is a fucking radio show where we trash each other.  If you're going to walk in, that's what happens, stupid.  Okay?  I'm sorry.  He just trashed you, Rich.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  He just killed you.  It was like a standing ovation.  Yeah, I think he understands that well. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah.  And he did it really well.  He had a great exit and everything.  That was like a wrestling move.  He thought he was going to finish thinking.  It's delicious, though.  He's enjoying drugs.  The energy drink closer was like a hack road move.  That was good.  It was like he was doing a little talk-up thing.  This is very good, JBL.  Thank you.  It's delicious.  It did.  I'm fine.  I'm over it.  He's over it.  Everybody's getting it out today.  Rich, you know what?  What?  You might have got the best of Mike earlier, but Roland just destroyed you.  You know what Roland just did?  He destroyed you.  That was built-up anger over months for some reason. 
[02:28:00]  I told you you don't want to get on his bad side.  But that was some kind of built-up.  No, he's like that.  That was built-up anger.  That wasn't built-up.  He's just like that.  That just didn't happen from one statement.  He's mild-mannered.  That was built-up.  That was some other stuff, man.  Roland took on fucking Master Poe, all right?  Roland is an animal.  He's an animal.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, shit.  You didn't say that.  I'm sorry.  Your wife's so funny.  That's her.  That's her.  Oh, God. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  You guys book another club act and sizzle.  There you go.  Stop while you're ahead.  The encore's not working.  My wife's very funny.  She's had an HBO special.  She's done Letterman twice.  I know.  She's very funny.  Okay, she's funny.  I know.  If your voice is cracking, Rich, just lay off.  Mike, you're taking it.  Mike, you're taking it.  Mike, my wife is very funny.  You're going after my wife?  She's not even here.  I know, but this is really delicious.  What is drank?  And we are saying it right. 
[02:29:00]  It's called drank.  Drank.  Drank.  That drank pretty good.  I like drank.  It drank pretty good.  What's that other one?  That was mo.  Mo.  Cool.  I've done Kimmel.  Drank.  Oh, you just won.  Oh, now he had it.  I've done Kimmel.  Yeah, but not again.  Really?  I didn't try.  Oh!  I didn't try.  Holy shit.  Oh, shit.  God damn, bro.  Wow.  Spider.  Wow.  Once is enough. 
[02:29:30]  That's all I needed.  Spider's going to get shot.  Voss is going to pull out a fucking 22 in a second.  JBL, you enjoying this?  Make me think what the fuck I did over here.  So your wife's funny?  She is.  She's very funny.  Great comic.  And a good mommy.  Yes.  How do you know?  Well.  I'm just saying, like, honestly, how do you know?  Well, you could tell.  Yeah, what the fuck?  How do you know?  She's just saying.  You don't know.  Yeah. 
[02:30:00]  She's a great comic.  I'm a genius, but she's a good comic.  I understand that.  See, my wife is a bit of an overachiever, too.  She was on the cover of Fortune magazine this past week.  If you really, yes.  For what?  First financial analyst ever on the cover of Fortune magazine.  Wait, do we know your wife?  Meredith Whitney.  How do we know her?  Roland's going.  Have we seen her?  Yep, yep.  Is she on TV?  No, I just saw the cover at the newsstands.  Roland's on the cover of Get a Guest magazine this week.  Let it be.  Do you do, wait, Rich, do you do comedy anymore? 
[02:30:30]  No.  Are you involved in the comedy community at all?  I'm Scrabble.  I'm a Scrabble champion now.  He's a melatonin in the drink.  Wow, JBL, right on, man.  Damn.  Look at JBL's wife.  Oh, yeah.  I'm dumb.  Beautiful, man.  She definitely looks familiar.  I've seen her.  Yeah, I think we've seen her on TV, maybe?  She's been on Fox News.  Sure, yep.  She's on CNBC recently.  Maria brought to her.  She doesn't do much TV anymore.  Why not? 
[02:31:00]  Too busy.  Raising kids?  No, unfortunately, not yet.  She's smart and attractive.  See that?  Yeah, she's beautiful.  Two for two.  She called the Enron scandal before it happened.  Did she really?  Yep, sure did.  Kreskin?  She's had a great year.  She's had a great career, but this year has been phenomenal for her.  Great.  Wonderful.  She's actually in the 50 Most Powerful Women in the World list.  She's probably funnier than Voss.  Oh, Vossy.  It's not a high bar, but yeah.  Oh, damn. 
[02:31:30]  One-two punch.  Me and JBL.  We're going on the road.  We're going on the road together.  They boo for me.  They cheer for him.  It's a good combo.  And look at it.  Roland just left.  He was like, yeah, I've had enough.  He had an amazing...  Is she that...  I told you not to mess with him.  You probably too messed with him.  Well, I told us not to mess with him as I was born.  He is one of the most mild-mannered guys I've ever seen.  But that was some built-up, really built-up...  We learned that though.  I've never done anything to him before.  You doing all right, Roland?  I'm doing okay.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:32:00]  What's the score, Rich?  Did you go back and book a guest?  What's the score, Rich?  No.  That's the score, Rich.  Enjoy.  And there goes the scrabble board.  Did you win?  I can tell.  That's all right.  Wait, I got my next word.  You had an ED there.  I was going to put EY over it for the triple word.  So it would have been four, five, six, seven, eight...  Oh, really?  ...times three is 24. 
[02:32:30]  That's my last move.  If that was food, he'd have never done that.  Oh, shit.  Roland!  We told you not to make fun of that.  You don't do that to Roland.  Roland!  Yes?  That's suicide.  He said if it was food, you wouldn't have done that.  Oh, wow.  I could lose weight here, Rich, but you can't get funnier.  I can't.  Try that.  Pray to your God that you killed or didn't kill.  You're right.  I can't.  It's 225 to 145. 
[02:33:00]  I had my fucking...  No, the game's out.  25 to 145.  The game never got finished, so you don't win.  Well, I'm saying where we start.  You don't win.  It's unofficial, Rich.  Jimmy was on a roll.  It's an unofficial win.  What's that?  24?  Yeah.  I feel like that's karma.  The Roland situation.  Oh, yeah.  That means nothing to me.  It means nothing to me.  It's just some built-up anger that he has.  It's not.  That's just who he is.  No, you don't come in and get that crazy.  No, he does.  That's his.  Over nothing.  It's not just crazy.  You're not special, Rich.  You're not special. 
[02:33:30]  That's how he is.  To anybody else, has he done that thing?  Yeah, he's crazy.  No, I don't, but when somebody pisses me off, I go from zero to a thousand.  Yeah, and he's funny.  I mean, if he's not funny.  He beat up.  He beat up.  He's not funny.  He went after Master Poe.  He went after, but it's built up.  Has he gone after you guys like that?  Yeah, but you did call him fat.  I didn't call him fat.  I did not once say he's fat.  He made a treadmill comment.  What does that mean?  Really, you did insult the guy.  Yep.  Listen to me.  I was sticking up for you on your dumb drink earlier.  No, no, no. 
[02:34:00]  All right?  Let me tell you something.  Senior Tour wrestler.  I was sticking up.  Don't jump on his side.  Are you crazy?  Why, Rich?  How do you fucking wrestle with a walker?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  Wow.  Yeah, you're right away.  Run, Rich.  Run.  Exactly.  Yeah, you wrestle with a walker, but yet he has a kid and 58 years old.  Right?  You know what?  So you can't bounce him on the walker.  You know what, darling?  You know what?  You know what?  You're taking to college?  She'll drop you off the homeless.  Or the hospice.  Do you know why I don't have a kid?  All right, she's going to college.  There's my dad.  He's shit himself again. 
[02:34:30]  That's pass, guys.  There you go, JBL.  I got your back, dog.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  Thank you, Roland.  Roland is killing.  Oh, my God.  Rich.  Rich.  What?  Roland is tearing you to pieces.  He's out of his mind.  He's out of control.  He's just built up anger.  No, it's called funny.  It's called funny.  Yeah.  He's funny.  He's being funny.  Good jokes.  An arsenal of good jokes. 
[02:35:00]  He said you're going to bounce your kid on your rocker.  Yeah.  That's probably what'll happen.  Probably what'll happen.  Mike Perpiglia's got something.  Mike.  What makes me sad about Rich is that he takes out his anger on me this morning.  He goes after me.  No, I didn't.  He goes after Roland.  But the thing that's kind of sad is that...  I didn't go after Roland.  He came after me.  But then the thing that was sad is it's like, you know, you're doing well.  You got a humble little living for yourself in comedy.  Mike, I have three beautiful kids.  I don't care about this. 
[02:35:30]  In the real world, I have a great life.  Stop.  Did he just say that?  Yes.  You're right.  In the real world, I have a great life.  So, bing.  In the real world?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a great life.  You're doing great.  That was the lamest response I've ever heard.  You're unsuccessful.  I've got three kids.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  You're unsuccessful.  Listen to me, vending machine man.  I'm going to tell you something.  Holy shit.  Jack Vita.  Calm down.  Give me a hug.  Shut up.  Give me a hug.  Listen.  Yeah, give him a hug. 
[02:36:00]  Give him a hug.  Why don't you hug?  Give him a hug.  I'm not a hug then.  No, no, I know.  But remember earlier?  Give him a hug.  Give him a hug.  Give him a hug.  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Everything's okay because they hug now, JBL.  It's all good.  I have a great career, JBL.  Listen to me.  I have a great...  No, no, no.  But say you've got a great career.  Don't say you've got three kids.  No, I'm not saying...  I mean, mention your career.  No, you're missing.  He just said you've got a rotten career, and you go, I've got three kids.  No, no.  Anyone can dump a load.  That's what you said.  My accomplish is three times I dump the loads. 
[02:36:30]  That's fucking in an A.  A hundred times you swallow them.  I know.  I'm saying my...  Mookies can reproduce.  You bet you can.  Listen.  No, seriously.  Mookies can reproduce.  You're wrong.  If you have a great career, you should defend your career, not just say, I've sired three  children.  Look at that.  No, no.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  Is career part of your life?  Is that part of your life?  No, you're saying this part of your life.  Yes, sir.  Listen to me.  He's attacking your professional career.  If you're talking about fraud, you committed every night you go in the ring. 
[02:37:00]  Shut up.  I'm saying my whole life, the overall part of my life, I am saying it.  Wait a minute.  What?  Me calling myself a wrestler is no worse than you calling yourself a comedian.  No.  That's true.  Really?  Really?  Listen to me.  You know what I love about Voss is that he always goes after me by saying my career is  going well.  It's like, no one knows who the fuck I am.  He's like, you and your career is going so well.  You know, some of us don't have it so good. 
[02:37:30]  No one knows.  Mike, what was Rich talking about on the way over?  His latest project?  Oh, he's got a Lifetime.  No, I had no.  He's got a pilot on the Lifetime Network.  Right.  We had one.  It wasn't picked up.  Lifetime.  I had four pilots.  Let me tell you, if it was picked up, I would have been as happy as anybody.  All right.  Okay.  A big deal.  I'm saying Lifetime.  I don't know what show that you would be involved in that would actually fit on Lifetime.  That's what I'm saying.  Roland had it canceled.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  What did Roland do?  I don't know.  What did Roland do? 
[02:38:00]  You know, he keeps leaving.  Don't blink at what you're doing.  Roland keeps leaving like a gentleman, and you keep dragging him back in by insulting  the man.  I'm not insulting him.  Yeah, Rich.  What's wrong with you?  What's the matter, Rich?  The poor kid just wants to go and mind his business.  Yeah, he's just trying to book the hard worker.  He's probably back there on the phone.  What do you mean he's going well?  I don't know why you're going after people.  Things are going well for you.  You got a nice career.  You got these three kids we've heard about.  You just got married at City Hall.  Yeah, I sure did.  Things are good. 
[02:38:30]  Things are just fine.  Why are you going after everybody today?  I'm not going after anybody.  I'm just defending myself.  This morning, you went after me.  No, I didn't.  Puppy pile.  Puppy pile.  I like this puppy pile.  I don't think there's going to be a puppy pile in here.  Oh, sorry.  I hug you.  He did hug you.  He did hug you, and you were reticent to hug him.  I don't like touching, man.  If I did, I'd get into wrestling.  Oh, shit.  That deserved more.  I don't know why that didn't get a laugh.  Because we're all nervous that he might lose his teeth. 
[02:39:00]  That's why, Jimmy.  Hey, listen.  Your brain works in a mysterious way.  Should I laugh or be scared?  I'm going to go and scare him this time around.  I'll just take his fake teeth and put them in, okay?  His fake teeth are better than your fake teeth.  My fake teeth are a lot better than yours.  They are.  At least his came out in a manly way from being fucking fisticuffs.  Yours just came out because you had one too many Diet Cokes and fucking ronkakama.  I was going to go with sperm ronting the teeth.  It was a little too long.  Yeah, you're right.  And ronkakama, that's when you drink Diet Coke.  You can't drink it at home. 
[02:39:30]  Look, we all saw it, Bob.  No reason to make that go worse.  Attack him.  Rich, why are you making everyone feel bad about themselves?  So you really got fake teeth?  They're all fake, yeah.  No kidding.  I'm knocked out from football, from wrestling, yeah.  Jesus.  So do you feel it when you chew something, or does it just feel the same?  They're all root canals.  They're all fake.  So, Rich, when you eat, does it feel like you're a horse?  Does it feel like you're eating like a horse?  I know.  When I eat it, there's not 2,000 people brewing. 
[02:40:00]  Okay?  When I eat it, I walk off with dignity.  That's right.  I don't run into the audience sweating with a hood on.  When you eat it, there's just one guy in front of you with his propane.  He just stole my material.  He just stole my material.  What was your material?  You're stealing the dryer's material.  We were doing this earlier.  We did it a lot earlier.  No, but why did you steal his material?  You should have hurt when you were born.  He stole my material.  Take your heart.  You should have heard that when you were parking the car that we talked about him bombing.  We have a limo outside.  We have a limo?  What do you got, a bike?  Do you have a bike? 
[02:40:30]  You.  Go get some.  You know what?  Go have Roland write you some material.  He's good at this.  He's better than you.  Yeah.  He killed me.  He killed me.  He fucking smashed me.  I just said it.  He smashed me.  He did destroy you.  He did destroy you.  That's what I did.  He killed you.  He destroyed you.  He totally killed you.  He lost a couple fights.  He smashed me.  Yes.  I think this drink.  I think this drank anti-energy drink brings out evil sides of people.  Yeah.  That's what I think it is.  I think you should grow back to easy.  I think you should grow back to easy Jerry Carlton and do deaf comedy jam again. 
[02:41:00]  You did that 20 years ago, didn't you?  15.  Wow.  15.  Wow.  15 when you had electricity.  Oh, Rich.  Oh, wow.  You had him in the room.  Mike just winced.  I like how Mike didn't even say anything.  He winced.  I know.  Maybe you could go to Ron Conkoma and have a diet milk.  God, do I suck.  Is that to you?  I wonder if Bananas will continue to book rich after this appearance this morning. 
[02:41:30]  Is Bananas a bad place to be?  I don't know.  Just kind of.  You're too big to do Bananas?  Is that it?  You're too big?  You don't do any fruit comedy clubs?  Fruit comedy clubs?  Is that what it is?  Are you funny on stage?  No.  Oh, damn.  JBL.  Jesus.  He's got like a joke book.  He comes out. 
[02:42:00]  He does kind of.  Don't even put that out there.  Joke specific to that audience.  He goes, oh, you're the black guy.  Here's the black jokes.  You're the Spanish guy.  That's what it is.  Here's the Spanish joke.  So it works.  Is that what it is?  It's all white people this morning, so he doesn't know what to do.  Oh, really?  That deserves a little laugh, too.  Because there's nothing.  He did that already.  I didn't.  You know what?  What's your name?  JBL.  JBL.  He's famous.  JBL.  We've been fucking talking to this guy for two hours.  He's been here.  It's three fucking letters, dummy.  Just think JBL, but with a B.  You're big on Jewish defense.  I think they try to spell it out on the Scrabble board. 
[02:42:30]  Oof.  Hurts, doesn't it?  Whoa.  Okay.  What do you got for JBL there, Rich?  I got nothing.  I have nothing.  Why don't you ask him a wrestling question?  Well, who gives a shit about it?  Wrestling?  Why don't I ask him a roller derby question?  JBL, he said, who gives a shit about wrestling?  Why don't I give a shit of it?  The apex of your career is Jimmy Kimmel, and you're making fun of him?  No, it's not.  It's not. 
[02:43:00]  Listen to me.  I've sold out arenas on six continents.  I've sold out arenas on six continents.  Wait, wait, wait.  Rich.  What's that?  Yeah.  It's rich.  It's peak.  He's known around the planet.  Biggest audience you ever performed in front of?  How many people?  75,000 at Woodstock or 100,000.  I hosted Woodstock.  They weren't there to see fucking Rich Voss.  Is that the question?  The guy that's fucking standing by a tree jerking off is performing in front of 75,000  people at Woodstock.  He asked me the question.  I answered it.  That doesn't count. 
[02:43:30]  I went to Zee Voss, but I enjoyed Pearl Jam.  That cannot count.  As a headliner, what's the biggest crowd you've been in front of?  17.  No, as a headline.  You weren't headlining our show.  I said 17.  I didn't say 17,000.  Oh.  Okay.  That's funny.  As a headliner.  JBL's been in front of what?  100 G's?  I've done theaters.  I don't know.  I've done theaters.  100 G's.  Really?  You disappointed that many people in one time?  In one time?  Don't look at your watch, Rich. 
[02:44:00]  What's the matter?  Are we fucking keeping you?  I just like looking at the watch.  Rich, nice watch.  When you call me today, can we, you know.  Because he's going to call.  Was that okay?  I got a busy day.  Yeah.  So really, should I apologize?  Yeah, it was okay, right?  Should I apologize to anyone?  You were a little mean to Mike.  You were.  You were slightly mean to JBL, who's a guest.  You were, you know, Roland and you were kind of brutal to each other.  JBL, expect this.  As soon as the mics go off, he's going to run right into your face.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm not listening.  You know. 
[02:44:30]  These guys get a little crazy.  And, you know, I didn't mean anything by what I said.  What the fuck?  I just like that one.  You motherfuckers.  Cut me a break.  I'm fucking exhausted.  I slept three hours.  I was with fucking a bunch of.  Oh, my God.  The sun's in my eyes.  My shoes are untied.  And it's fucking.  God almighty.  God, I'm a comedian, but I'm not funny.  Oh.  That's it again.  You're making excuses for not being funny.  Shut up, Brian Regan hair.  You're telling something.  Wait a minute.  Regan hair.  He attacks your career.  He attacks your career. 
[02:45:00]  Your only answer is, I breed like monkeys.  No, he was saying that.  Say something about you not being funny.  I'm exhausted.  Schooling Voss.  Schooling Voss.  He's not schooling me.  I'm going after everybody.  Here, let me get back to you.  I'm going after everybody.  Why are you making fun of his hair?  I'm not making fun of his hair.  Exactly.  Okay?  He has nice hair for his age.  What I'm saying.  He's younger than you.  What are you doing with the age thing with him?  He's younger than you.  Well, he looks like shit for his age.  If he's younger than me, every part of his body is fake. 
[02:45:30]  Listen to me.  What?  Here's the thing.  Voss says with his salt and pepper beard.  And his oat chewing teeth.  Oh.  Oh, damn.  Somebody bring me a braille.  I feel like I'm at the Belmont.  Fucking MC Hammer hair.  Holy shit.  Wow. 
[02:46:00]  I thought that was accurate.  At Pancake House this weekend?  No, I was just going to say, like, you kind of go back and forth on, like, what your joke  is about me.  Like, is my career going well?  Is it not going well?  Is it going too well?  Don't analyze it, Mike.  You can't analyze it.  You haven't kind of nailed down what your joke is about me yet.  I'll work on that with you.  Do you have three kids?  No.  Failure?  Failure.  That's it.  That's it.  You're taking it out of context.  You're taking it out of context. 
[02:46:30]  That's the barrier.  That's the watermark.  I got three kids.  Therefore, I need to run the world.  You and Sarah Palin are in the same boat.  That means Sarah Palin should really be president with five.  Yeah.  That's true.  Four and a half.  Is she going to Cleveland this week?  Wait, wait, wait.  I never think about my career.  You like the Sarah Palin?  You hear this, Jim?  I never think about my career as much as when I'm with Rich.  He brings it up so much.  I didn't bring it up once.  You brought up mine.  I didn't bring up your career once, Mike.  No, you brought it up over there.  You're just like a fucking liberal.  I swear to God, you twist everything.  I never said one thing about your fucking career. 
[02:47:00]  You said it about mine.  You said like ten things.  No, I didn't say anything.  We could play back the tape.  I didn't say anything liberal.  Let me tell you something.  You were saying, oh, you have a nice little career.  I said I have a great life.  No, I didn't say that.  I said I had a great life and a career is part of my life.  That's it.  End of story.  I didn't talk about your dumb fucking career.  I'm talking about my life.  Now it's a dumb fucking career.  You know, I was saying what a fraud you are as a human, not your career.  Don't give a fuck about your career.  People in this business just bullshit their way through careers. 
[02:47:30]  It means nothing to me.  How does a comic bullshit his way through a career?  Oh, really?  Turn on the fucking TV, stupid.  I just want to know.  Really?  I want to describe it.  Oh, really?  I am the voice of the listeners.  They're out there going, how does a comic, like, be a fraud as far as his career goes?  And that's all.  So I'd want you to tell the listeners, not me.  I don't want to sound like sour grapes.  Listen, whatever.  Sounds like you have a whole bunch in your mouth when you're talking. 
[02:48:00]  Sour grapes, they're sour balls.  Thanks, Ant.  Enough.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Oh, Rich.  Oh, Rich.  What?  Come on.  I did not say anything about his career.  No, I didn't.  Play back the tape.  I mean, whatever.  Rich wants to hear don't leave.  So let's do it.  Rich, don't leave.  I don't know how many times we have to play back tape to just fucking hang someone out  to dry.  This show is hysterical.  Play the fucking tape.  Play it.  Play it three times.  Coming from the guy that basically started it. 
[02:48:30]  I didn't start anything.  You said JBL's drink was some kind of fag shit drink.  In the mirror, I said that the color of the can was reminiscent of colors that certain  communities, maybe down in the meatpacking district.  He thought hard on the color.  He really thought hard on the color.  You insulted him.  I'm out.  Oh, Mike's out.  I'm out.  Where are you going?  It's good to me, JBL.  Sorry to go.  Mike, this is a brave move.  No problem.  This is a brave move.  Mike, this is a brave move.  Getting the first one out. 
[02:49:00]  I don't know.  I leave until these fucking mics are off and cold.  Why do you think we go to noon sometimes?  I have to do some local radio phoners.  Oh.  Hey.  There you go.  I've got a big tour coming up, everybody.  Rich, it was really nice talking to you today.  We'll talk.  It was a pleasure.  Hang in there.  I will.  I will.  Sometime I'll get the status that you have.  No, no.  I thought it was a shit career.  That was another one of these things where it's like, he doesn't know where to place my  career.  It's gone too well.  That was in the bathroom.  You're telling me to hang in there? 
[02:49:30]  I'm telling you.  I'll get to respect.  He's giving you some advice.  Just hang in there.  Oh, he's going to give me advice?  Yes.  Really?  Let him finish.  Mike, hang in there.  I don't need marketing advice.  You're a good guy.  We like you.  We like you a lot.  Yeah, we're going to have...  The marketing thing I brought up as a joke is a self-deprecating joke.  No, I brought it up before you.  No, no.  I brought it up in the billboard.  I brought it up before you.  Then after that, you brought it up.  Go to the tapes.  Go to the tapes.  Can you believe this?  As soon as you say, go to the tapes, and people understand that that's the sentence  you're saying, we'll go to the tapes. 
[02:50:00]  See you later, Mike.  What Starbucks are you headed to?  What's that about?  He's got coffee.  I got to go do...  Oh, because that's a liberal thing?  ...foners.  Local radiofoners to promote my tour.  I think he's making a liberal joke.  This is national.  What?  This is national.  I know.  We've been on the air for two and a half hours.  I got to do local shit.  Yeah.  Do some more promotion.  All right.  All right.  Let's see you guys.  Nice to meet you, JBL.  I'm sorry if I made jokes that were obnoxious.  That were funny?  That's compared...  Oh, see, Rich. 
[02:50:30]  Thank you.  I really bring out the worst in people.  You really do.  I met the guy for 10 minutes.  Because JBL hated Mike before.  He didn't like Mike before.  Well, everybody's like that with Mike.  But now he hates you more.  You've managed to make them like you.  That's how awful you are to them.  You made them like each other.  United in hatred of you.  Yeah.  They're like fucking Iran and Iraq against Syria.  You need a globe?  Huh?  I should have said Israel.  Of course.  I know.  Because Iran and Iraq. 
[02:51:00]  But they kind of like Syria.  They love Syria.  They love Syria.  Of course they do.  But, you know.  Rich, why don't you go for the big out?  So we can applaud your appearance.  No.  I should have done it a while ago.  You're down to a B minus.  I had you at a solid A earlier.  Thank God Mike's gone, right?  I fought 12 people.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, but you lost to 12.  If you were like, I fought 12 and I kicked the shit out of two of them.  Yeah.  That's something.  Maybe I'll come back in 12 years. 
[02:51:30]  Here's the thing.  What?  What do you mean?  Nothing.  No, we need to know.  What?  Nothing.  In 12 years what?  That'd make you what?  63.  Most comedians make it around age 50.  I think you're going to do well.  Oh, fuck.  Why didn't you let me open for you in Cleveland?  Bitch.  I know.  You want to go for the big out?  No.  Fucking love.  Well, guys, I'm going to go for the big out.  Thank you very much. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, JBL is second out.  It is terrific to see you guys.  You guys do a wonderful job.  What is this?  Like a battle royale, but one by one they're leaving the ring?  Yep.  There, Sam.  That's it.  Throwing over the rope.  Right.  That's it.  Hey, this is JBL, John Bradshaw Laffle from the WWE.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's say hi to Chris in Philly.  Chris?  What's going on, fellas?  What's up, Chris?  I'm the guy that usually calls about Ron Paul here and there, but since you have Mr. Stanhope  in the studio, I figured I'd let him do the talking.  Oh, I'm a big Ron Paul guy. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Did you even try to have him on?  Well, we kind of beat him up and sent him on his way.  You had him on?  No, we didn't.  Oh, you just beat him up?  Yeah.  Oh, why?  I see a bunch of...  Because they're zealots?  Because it was fun.  We see a bunch of signs and stuff.  We see the only guy that was worth...  At this point, I hope Obama wins because in a movie, if there's going to be a president  portrayed in a movie where the fucking asteroid is coming to blow up the earth, and I have  those three to choose from as the actor to play president. 
[02:53:00]  Okay.  I'll pick Barack.  Sure.  The only guy that would have made any difference is Ron Paul, and it's sad, but...  We didn't take it seriously because we just knew there just wasn't even a shot.  Not going to happen.  We had a Baywatch babe stumping for him, and we just kind of made fun of her.  I'm being honest with you.  No one was voting for him.  He wasn't going to...  Why was Ron Paul the only choice there?  I mean, he's the only one that really had any chance of getting less government in our 
[02:53:30]  lives.  Yeah, but any chance, or he just wanted that, and it would have been business as usual?  Again, he's the only one I would trust to do it.  Like John McCain, he's...  I believe Ron Paul meant what he said, as opposed to anyone else.  I think it's...  Even Huckabee I like better than these fucking clowns, because of the fair tax.  Yeah, yeah, I know.  That's what a lot of people...  And that's really my big concern is taxes at this point.  I don't give a fuck about the war.  I'm not going. 
[02:54:00]  It's like, why is it selfish to just think of yourself?  Everybody votes selfishly.  Yeah.  Of course.  Like, taxes are a big thing, because they tax the shit out of you.  Yeah.  But, you know, so that's what I would like to vote for, somebody that wants, like, a  flat tax or something like that, instead of taxing the shit out of people they...  Ron Paul and Huckabee were the only ones talking about major tax.  Nothing's going to happen with an elected official in this country anymore. 
[02:54:30]  It's going to take some kind of ridiculous revolution.  A draft?  Some kind of uprising?  Some kind of invasion from a foreign country?  It's going to take some huge thing that really fucks up this country.  It was the draft that made Vietnam.  That's what turned the...  Yeah, yeah.  We were in Vietnam for a long time before people started getting pissed.  That's when kids started dying against their will.  Yeah.  Yeah, and not the meatheads who believed the ads and saw the guy slaying a dragon and signed  up.  But it's changing his tune. 
[02:55:00]  When they're snatching him out of your house and throwing him in front of shrapnel.  Yeah.  But, Anthony, you said if Obama gets in, then a lot would change.  Yeah.  I'm thinking as...  I said a lot meaning as much as could possibly change with what's going on.  If Obama gets in, then everyone can say nigger and it's funny again.  Is that it?  Yeah.  And if Hillary gets in, women will bleed a little bit less.  Like, that's why I hate people who jump on the bandwagon just because they have matching  skin tone or genitalia. 
[02:55:30]  Well, it's about time one of us was in office.  Like, that's not your fucking friend.  Yeah.  If Barack is president, what, mall security is going to stop following you around?  You're fucking buddies.  We're white males with nothing but white male presidents for our whole lives.  We have not flourished under their leadership.  Well.  Well.  Yeah, we did.  It did kind of work out.  Well, not because of it.  Of course not.  I liked Taft.  Myself.  Taft.  Taft.  A lot of change under Taft. 
[02:56:00]  Let's say hi to Craig in Jersey.  Craig.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey there, Craig.  Hey, another big supporter of Ron Paul was Donna DeHarico.  I remember she called in a couple of weeks ago.  Yeah, we gave her some shit.  Steve from Yellowstone talked to her, so I was wondering if you guys could maybe replay  that at the end of the show today.  Well, Denny, I don't remember.  How long is that called?  Because it might be uncomfortable for a four-minute phone call.  Doug, we kind of beat up your guy.  Oh, that's right.  I don't care. 
[02:56:30]  You're talking about him, at least.  More than the regular media does.  I guess we just didn't want to hear it from abroad.  I used to run around on a beach on TV.  Did you guys support anyone, or is it all sports to you, too?  Now it's beyond anything that I even give a shit about.  Did you ever like anyone?  Yeah, I liked that one guy.  What was his name?  Larry Craig.  No, he's a go-getter.  I want a president that has a wide stance when he shits, please. 
[02:57:00]  Tap me up a river dance trying to get that guy to my stall.  Creep.  No.  Duncan Hunter.  Duncan Hunter.  I liked Duncan Hunter.  No, he was an ultra-conservative douchebag.  The Gravel guy, he was an insane person.  I would have liked to see him go.  I like the whole libertarian idea.  Yeah.  I like that whole thing, but it just would never work in this country at this point in  the country's history.  Again, you're talking absolute libertarian, but if you're pragmatic about it, there's 
[02:57:30]  parts of it that can work.  There's too many people that can't fucking take care of themselves under this government  that just takes you and poutes your ass.  That's how we breed them.  We breed people to be fucking idiots.  I know, weaklings.  You try to legislate against Darwinism and natural selection, and that's what you get.  It's a fucking country full of retards and more of them.  Let them fucking fend for themselves and let them learn on their own, and Jesus.  Let them fly through the fucking windshield because they're not buckling up, but then don't 
[02:58:00]  sue the fucking piss out of me when you fly through the windshield.  That is the problem.  Too many goddamn lawyers.  Lawyers, fuck up.  More stuff.  And if you were to separate government from corporations, everyone thinks the libertarian  ideal won't work because, well, now corporations will become government, but that's only if they're  in bed together.  Yeah.  If government has the power to give corporations all these breaks, then yeah, you're going 
[02:58:30]  to have problems.  But if you separate them completely and put government in a position where they can't  do shit for a corporation, then it's a different story.  Don't you think there'd be just massive poverty and death on the streets from people that can't  take care of themselves without the government being there to fucking coddle them?  No, I think easy money spends easily, and I think people are naturally charitable, and  they get pissy when you're fucking taking, when you're taking 40% of my fucking paycheck.  No shit.  All of a sudden, the fucking bum on the street, I'm going, fuck you, get a job. 
[02:59:00]  Where if I had that money in my pocket, it's probably fucking titty dancers.  Titty dancers have easy money, and they spend it easily.  You go out with a fucking guy who works 50 hours at fucking Staples as an assistant manager  and a titty dancer, more than likely, the titty dancer is going to pick up a tab before the  other guy does.  He has to work way too hard.  I think people are naturally charitable.  It's like the tsunami.  It worked out to like $50 per household was the average donation to tsunami victims. 
[02:59:30]  That was private households.  If you had someone go door to door, knocking on doors, going, this is the government, you  owe us $50 for the tsunami victims.  They'd be going, fuck those dookers.  Let them drown.  Because it's the force that's involved.  You're so right.  When you make money easy, you definitely spend a lot for you.  Yeah.  There's easy money to be made. 
[03:00:00]  40% of people.  It is sickening the amount of money they want to take.  They're fucking repulsive.  Right.  And they still can't get stuff done.  They can't get enough.  Where does it, I mean, eh.  There's already so many charitable organizations out there that you can go to, the fucking  churches, if you, yeah.  But the age-old question, like, where the fuck does all this money go?  What the hell is wrong?  Well, a billion dollars on a war.  Yeah, no, I understand that, but when you start breaking down what that money is being 
[03:00:30]  used for in the war, it gets insane.  Like, you know, we've all heard the rivets costing $10,000 and all that stuff.  Right, yeah, no.  It's like, it's ridiculously sweet government contracts, they're called.  How are people who do, who build a government like that, how are they not just executed?  For treason.  For treason.  Yeah.  Really?  They should.  There's a lot of people that should be dispatched with.  They're in bed together.  They got a company that fucking paid to have some guy put in office.  They made all kinds of contributions. 
[03:01:00]  So when the guy gets in office, he gives them the sweet contracts and favors.  It's a sweet deal, Wade.  I like those numbers.  All I wanted to do as you were talking, and I know you're right, is when you were done,  all I wanted to do is go, says you.  That's all I think now.  Says you.  That's all I think now.  I wish I could have gone out.  I'd have laughed my ass off.  Yeah, well, nothing's going to get done until there's some kind of big fucking revolution 
[03:01:30]  or an invasion, civil war.  People have to really have their face put into a fire before they fight back.  We need, like, American refugees.  We need, like, fucking people fleeing to Canada in those huge lines of dying people in this country  to get it back to a position where maybe we can rebuild something cool.  I really think if Ron Paul had gone after the families of people who have someone in prison,  it's like 60% of the prison population are there for nonviolent drug offenses. 
[03:02:00]  Absolutely no, everyone involved in that should be fucking hung.  You always hear about people that are doing more time for drugs than manslaughter.  Do you own your own body?  It's a question of that.  Do you believe you own your own body?  Then you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want with it.  That's just basic property ownership, property rights.  You were talking about you can't put a fucking pool in it.  Earlier, yeah, I'm trying to get, like, some work done at the house, 
[03:02:30]  and you go to get permits for things,  and they tell you how many feet something has to be off your property line,  and you're like, wait, I bought this shit.  You know, I should be able to fucking set up a missile silo if I want.  It's coming in next week, by the way.  Take that one step further to your own body,  and they're telling you what you can do with your own body.  You can't, I can't put drugs inside of it?  Yeah.  60%, the highest prison population of any country in the world.  Right, we excel at something.  60% of that.  You go after, you use that as a main platform. 
[03:03:00]  You have the families, they can't vote in prison, but their families can,  and that's one hell of a fucking base of support.  Hell of a.  You should have gone after.  Hell of an idea you got.  He smokes a lot of dope, man.  The prisoners' families.  You got some good ideas.  Those votes.  Yeah, you don't own your own body.  You don't own your own home.  You don't own shit.  We talked about that in the past with America, you know, we're free here.  You're free.  You're not free to do shit.  Yeah.  You really aren't.  Yeah, we joke about it.  Let's see how free you are.  Why don't you take a gun, go out on the streets of New York, 
[03:03:30]  and try to hunt for your own dinner.  Just go hunt for your own dinner.  Start taking pot shots at something and see how fast you're free.  You're free to follow the fucking rules.  That's what you're free to do.  Man.  What a tool I am.  This is my closer on Deadbeat Hero 2004.  Imagine if you just, like, saw some nice sweet property and decided that you're just going to build.  You're just going to fucking build.  I'm just going to get some wood and just start building.  Isn't that right?  I'm going to build a soddy like fucking Paw Ingles. 
[03:04:00]  That's how it used to be.  God, can you imagine living during those times?  You can come home from my rack without legs, and they say, well, two more years, you can have a beer.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't even drink.  Like, you're 19 years old.  He's fucking, yeah.  King Tut ruled the world at 11.  And now, we saw how that worked out there.  Fucking, they changed his race and bashed his brains in and fucking wrapped him up in a giant tampon  and shipped him around like a spectacle.  Yeah.  And he still draws better than either of us. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, you're right.  Oh, shit.  God damn.  King Tut was a you-know-what lover.  Excuse me, but we do have regular Joe checking in today.  Regular Joe, yes.  Yeah, you just can't buck the system.  Ah, well, yeah.  You can't buck the system.  It's like I always say, you can't fight Town Hall.  That's just me.  It's regular Joe guy. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, you know.  I like to just say, what are you going to do?  You know, regular Joe says, I'd complain, Doug, but who'd listen?  Brad Lee from Branson, Missouri writes, you're free to do as we tell you, a famous line from Bill Hicks.  Meh.  Very, very true.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  That's what I like to say.  Amen.  Amen to that.  That's right.  Uh, Boston checking in.  Jason?  Yes.  Hey.  What's up, boys?  What's up?  So Massachusetts has this nice thing called excise tax, where every year they charge you 
[03:05:30]  $25 per $1,000 your car is worth.  So they take the blue book value of your vehicle, they charge you $25, and each year, my value  of my vehicle is $5,000 this year, and I have to pay $2,500 every year.  How is that fucking legal?  How did they work that out?  But you're, why are we throwing tea off a fucking boat, like, years ago for nothing?  Who is pro-tax?  Right.  You understand why some laws are, you know, there's always going to be gay marriage or whatever. 
[03:06:00]  There's always going to be the church people that are against it, the moral majority.  But everybody's against fucking the taxation.  Yeah, yeah, you're, you're being represented, uh, you know, the, the constituency is being  represented by somebody that goes to Washington and represents the people.  Who the fuck is going, yes, more taxes!  That's what we want, that's why I elected this guy.  And then you get the, they go in there, raise the shit out of your taxes, and yeah, where,  who's, who's going for that? 
[03:06:30]  Who wants it?  Well, regular Joe says, I, uh, I wish it would change, but, uh, you know, wishing one hand  shit in the other, and see which hand the German fella eats out of.  Wow, regular Joe is not quite as regular as he was.  Yeah, regular Joe threw a zinger in there.  Regular Joe getting a little blue.  Yeah, you know.  Let's go to AJ in Connecticut.  AJ.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, sir.  Hold on, they're swearing on the lieutenant governor.  Sorry, you're missing it.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:07:00]  Holy shit.  Wow.  All right.  That'll get us fired.  Whoa.  I missed it.  I completely missed it.  I'm just out.  Nothing.  It's, yeah, you, you certainly don't want to comment on that.  Whoa, hey, uh, AJ, Connecticut, what's up?  What's up?  Uh, the income tax is actually illegal.  If you check out, uh, of Alex Jones' work, it's up on, uh, Google Video.  Yeah, but check out what it became of all those tax protesters that said, you know, it's not 
[03:07:30]  even in the Constitution.  Yeah, jail.  They're serving jail time.  Goodbye.  The rules are what they say.  They're now telling fellow inmates about the fact that they're, that it's illegal.  It's illegal.  I don't play.  They're getting deep-dicked in a shower.  The money goes to private, private banks that own, that run the Federal Reserve, and it  goes to pay the interest on the money that comes into circulation.  Ah, you know what?  It's all Greek to me.  And the gold standard, and the World Bank, and the New World Order is trying to enslave 
[03:08:00]  us all as a planet.  Maybe they are, but...  Oh, regular Joe is a joke.  Oh, okay.  The regular Joe?  I don't make, I don't make up the rules.  I just break them.  Uh.  Boo!  Can't pull regular Joe.  Regular Joe's funny as well.  Regular Joe's an asshole.  Why?  Regular Joe cracks him up around the garage.  This container of coffee.  And this fucking... 
[03:08:30]  Little words of wisdom and wit.  Yeah, you know, Joe's just the guy they go to.  Joe's a flaming homosexual.  Ah, no, sir.  No way.  Hey, uh...  Joe's a...  Trisexual.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, Joe will try anything.  That's a funny one.  Regular Joe says, I'm straight.  My ass is exit only.  All right.  That's what regular Joe says.  Of course he does.  That's right.  Because he's got a mouthful of cock around a glory hole.  Regular Joe's a hypocrite.  And a cocksucker.  And a cocksucker. 
[03:09:00]  Let's go to Kevin in Houston.  Regular Joe never met a cock that he didn't want to pop in his mouth, if only for a second.  Kevin.  Hey, we got a law that passed at the first of the year called a stripper poll tax, where  any person that goes into a strip club has to pay $5 tax that is then turned over to the  state and given to a victim's right to advocate groups, such as battered women, shelters, and  that kind of crap.  You better be kidding. 
[03:09:30]  They should do that from boxing proceeds.  It's a stripper poll tax in Texas.  Stripper poll tax.  Five bucks.  Is that a state, a county thing, or a city?  No, this is a state tax.  It's passed by the state legislation.  That doesn't...  I don't believe that.  Yeah.  Check it out, man.  Good old Governor Perry.  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  Let's go to James in Wisconsin.  James.  Taxes.  Yeah.  I used to do taxes back in the day. 
[03:10:00]  Man, now I'm a truck driver.  I've got the monies on that.  Taxes were actually volunteer from World War II.  Okay?  They were volunteer at that time to help support the war effort.  They were supposed to be dropped after that, and they weren't.  They're still volunteer.  They're not mandatory.  Actually, Lincoln instituted the first income tax on some level, which he gets...  His second biggest mistake.  Well, no.  All he did was spread slavery across color lines.  So now we're all slaves.  But the bottom line is, if you're going to play the game, you've got to play by their rules. 
[03:10:30]  If you don't play by their rules, they're going to throw you out of the game.  Use the game analogy again.  I didn't quite get it.  You look at the federal government...  Hold on, sir.  I'm on the sidelines.  Get to the plate.  If you don't play by my game, you're going to go to jail.  That's right, because the ball's in your court.  That's right, sir.  You're hitting home run with this one.  Go ahead.  Go.  That's right.  Have a good day, guys.  All right.  You know I and team.  2-8 on the punch out thing.  What's up with Abraham Lincoln? 
[03:11:00]  AIDS, and I hope you get it.  He instituted the first income tax.  Did he?  For what reason?  For the war effort.  Just for the war.  The civil one.  Yeah, the civil one.  That civil one.  I heard, though, it wasn't back then you just got taxed on one.  What you owned?  Like, they taxed you.  The assessor came around, assessed what you owned, and then...  God damn.  And then you'd have to pay a tax on it. 
[03:11:30]  But then it turned out, somebody's bright idea, to tax what you made.  Like, your earnings.  Yeah.  What is it?  The 20-something amendment?  17th.  17th?  No, he doesn't know.  Let's go to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean, what's up?  Oh, you know, you got a handful of these nuts that say, well, you know, you don't have to  pay taxes.  Who's going to be the first dumb motherfucker to jump off that cliff?  It's illegal, and I'm not paying it anymore. 
[03:12:00]  Well, Doug kind of went down that road.  Here's what you do is you buddy up and you get Opie and Anthony and Howard Stern and Bob  and Tom and every fucking morning fucking show around the country and you all get together  and go, hey, let's put our bullshit differences aside and let's get everyone to go, hey, fuck  you on April 15th and start a big fucking trend like that.  That's how you do it.  Did you put us in the same category as Bob and Tom?  And now Dane Cook, I'm saying too. 
[03:12:30]  And Larry the Cable Guy, they all put out a MySpace bullet and listen, and you get, yeah,  how many would it take to get a fucking massive rally going on?  A couple hundred.  Not many.  Because you can't just have one guy saying, I'm not paying.  And now we're all going to get audited just for having this idea.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that was Doug Stanhope.  Just for saying this out loud.  What we think is crazy.  Good one, Doug Stanhope.  Way to go, Doug.  Social security number.  And that's how you get a Ron Paul elected, too.  All right, let's go to Keith in North Carolina.  Keith.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man. 
[03:13:00]  Hey, the guy that called from Houston, I used to live there, and the strippers in Houston  have to go down to the Harris County Courthouse and get a license to strip.  Yeah.  They have to wear their real name and ID around their ankles, and if they don't have the license,  they can't wear a thong.  And so you know the ones without the license they're probably going to put out because they  can't afford the license.  Wait, strippers have a license now on their ankles?  Yeah, they have to wear them in Houston.  They have to wear them with a picture ID, and if they get pulled over by the cops, they  have to show them their driver's license and their SOB license. 
[03:13:30]  They call it the SOB.  But the hardest part about the stripper license is getting your abusive stepfather to come  down and have his photo taken.  That is weird.  The cop pulls you over.  He's like, you know, your name and bruised eye, please.  Keith in Louisville, what's up?  Hey, yeah, I just got back from El Paso, and we got hit with that $5 stripper pole tax.  You're kidding me?  Yeah, so we just went across to Juarez, Mexico, and watched the stripper jack off a donkey. 
[03:14:00]  For like $5.  That's just to get him to run.  That was a ride.  This isn't even a show.  It's just how you crank start your ride home.  Donkey won't budge.  Donkey tax.  This guy's saying there's no pole tax in Texas.  Kevin from Eakston.  You know Don King in Austin?  I've never heard of that tax.  I've never seen it.  I go to strip clubs quite a bit.  And plus, they don't want IDs around their ankle. 
[03:14:30]  So that's all bullshit with the IDs around the ankle?  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Wait, what has Dan got on this?  Dan's looking up some research here.  Oh, wait, no.  This says they're fighting it out.  So let me get a more updated thing.  Oh.  Because hopefully the fight's over.  No, it looks like Fox News.  Texas ads pole tax to strip clubs.  Wow.  Pole tax?  What the fuck?  Maybe they include it in the door fee.  I don't know.  Tax, tax, tax.  Tax enough.  They just want some of that strip club money, man. 
[03:15:00]  Because there's a lot of cash in the strip clubs.  Yep, a lot of cash moving back and forth.  So they're like, fuck that.  We want our piece.  That's all it's about, really.  They just want their piece of the action.  Donovan the Trucker, what's up?  Well, yeah, that guy in Austin's out of his fucking mind.  It's $5 to get in, and that's the tax.  And they make them wear the thing on their ankle or on their thing.  I live down in San Antonio.  My sister-in-law is a bartender.  $580 for the fucking stripper license, the SOB. 
[03:15:30]  $580?  $580, and that's why you start stripping.  It's because you don't show titties without a license, but you can't wear a thong.  So the girls who don't show titties and just get out there and dance with a bikini on don't have the license.  And they have to wear shoes.  You can't be barefoot either unless you have the license.  Oh, what the fuck is going on?  It's a health issue.  And they're fighting it, yes, so I don't know if it's all the way in effect, but yes, it's fucking real.  Who's thinking this shit up? 
[03:16:00]  Who's coming up with this shit?  In Alaska right now, my best friend's a bartender up in Alaska.  In Alaska, they have cops going into bars undercover.  Hot toddy, please.  I'll have a hot toddy.  Give me a hot toddy.  Give me an HD, please.  They got undercover cops going into bars in Alaska and looking for drunk people and then pulling them out of the bar saying,  who over-served you?  We could arrest you for being drunk in public, but we want to know who over-served you.  And they just point out a bartender and they take the bartender out in cuffs. 
[03:16:30]  Wow.  In Alaska.  Yeah, last frontier.  Wild, wild, yeah.  Which it used to.  A handful of years ago, five years ago, there were whorehouses.  There were six whorehouses I could stumble out of the bar that I played and go, fuck a whore.  And now it's all done.  Now you're fucking getting arrested for-  Alaska?  Yeah.  It's fucking terrifying.  Saw that coming.  In Texas, they were pulling people out of bars, what, two years ago? 
[03:17:00]  For just randomly drunk in public, arresting them.  Hotel bar.  They arrested, I guess, some-  A hotel bar.  Yeah.  One of them was-  One of the bus was a hotel bar and they arrested a woman for being drunk in public.  This shit's going out like little bits everywhere.  It's ugly as sin.  She must have just been blowing guys in the ground or something.  Yeah, what was she doing?  Come on.  I mean, I want to go with you, Doug, but she must have been just doing some horrific shit.  Listen, you motherfuckers!  Right.  But I mean, the fact that they would- 
[03:17:30]  Shut up her asshole nice and wide for anyone that's around.  The fact that they would even attempt that shows that they had this thing in place.  She was letting all the bar patrons eat peanuts out of her pussy at the bar.  She kept her legs open and had doodads in it.  She was shooting them out at patrons.  I've never gone to a Holiday Inn hotel lounge.  Hey, this place is way too rowdy.  Let's go somewhere quiet.  Why would you go to a Holiday Inn hotel lounge unless you went to see Voss perform on New Year's Eve?  Ah, he's not even here. 
[03:18:00]  Ah, ha, Rich.  Stupid Rich Voss.  Oh, fuck yourself.  You and your tumor.  Ah, Steve, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I know this is an old question, but if this government's so money-hungry for everything,  what if they legalize pot just for the tax money?  No one's ever said that before in their life.  Wow.  That's not a bad idea.  Wow.  That's an amazing idea.  Hey, the guy admitted right off the bat that he knows this is an old thing. 
[03:18:30]  I didn't hear him say that part.  It's a fetus argument.  I hate when they do that.  Why don't we legalize prostitution and tax it and we can wipe out the...  And legalize drugs and tax...  How about legalize them and don't tax them?  You're already caving in ahead of time.  Those things should be legal anyway because you own your own fucking body.  So don't already offer up a tax before you start fighting.  And people are under the impression that if they legalize pot and tax it,  everyone's going to be driving around.  It's just going to be another thing that's taxed. 
[03:19:00]  They're not going to have a balanced budget anyway.  That they waste the money.  You're not going to see it.  It's not going to be...  Hey, look.  It'll be another federal program.  Look at this.  We got the pot tax check that we just received from the government today.  Hey, if we discovered alcohol like this year in the year 2008,  you think it would be legal?  Hmm.  I was thinking about this because like pot and...  No, even Salvia, they're trying to...  But pot is evil, right?  But recently I was in Huntington for the St. Paddy's Day Parade, right? 
[03:19:30]  And by 5 o'clock in the afternoon on a Sunday,  the whole fucking town was so goddamn ripped.  People were almost getting run over by cars.  Girls were stumbling around the streets, passed out on the side,  trying to eat pizza, trying to get their shit back together.  And you're like, this shit is legal.  There's no way pot gets you more fucked up than booze.  That's what I'm getting at.  It doesn't happen.  You look at what the alcohol has done in this country.  What's the big deal about the pot?  Well, the money already has roots in alcohol.  It's like tobacco. 
[03:20:00]  It's too ingrained in the society where that money is already part of the ruling class.  They tried to make it illegal, and that didn't work out too well.  With what?  Prohibition.  Oh, yeah, of course.  And it spawned organized crime like a motherfucker.  If Pablo Escobar had been elected a senator before they found out what he was doing,  yeah, then maybe cocaine would have a way better shot at being legal,  because he's part of the ruling class.  Same thing with cigarettes.  If all of a sudden we discovered cigarettes today,  would that ever be legal? 
[03:20:30]  Are you kidding me?  No, no, and salvia divinarum, which is a hallucinogen that's like a 10-minute high  that you wouldn't do recreationally.  I did it once, and then it ruined the natural buzz I had going.  I started drinking, and then I smoked some salvia.  They're trying to make that illegal, and it's just because kids are doing it.  Kids will spin around in circles until they throw up just to feel differently, you know?  Just any kind of high, right?  Yeah.  They'll make that illegal, though, eventually, you know?  Yeah, stop that kid from spinning. 
[03:21:00]  Because they can't tax it.  Stop spinning.  Yeah.  I want my spin tax, and then I'll let you spin all you want.  Yeah, but it's just crazy, because you see, like, alcohol,  they glorified the shit out of that, and it's like...  Yeah, it's probably one of the most dangerous drugs you can be on,  and you could buy it anywhere.  And it's advertised everywhere.  I mean, St. Paddy's Day is, what, next week?  And right here in New York City, you're going to see so many fucking drunks  getting the shit kicked out of them.  All puking in the street.  All sorts of crazy shit's going to happen. 
[03:21:30]  And if, again, like methamphetamine, it's rampant,  where if you offered them better drugs, like you gave them mushrooms were out there,  people would do mushrooms.  I'll do that.  Don't need to look like you took a shotgun blast to the head.  Yeah.  Fucking crystal meth.  Give them better drugs.  Let's say hi to Dave in Chicago.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, Doug is absolutely right.  What they started doing down in Texas a couple years ago,  they send other cover cops into bars, and they target people, 
[03:22:00]  and they watch them for about an hour,  and then see how many drinks they've had,  and then they go up to them and make them blow on a breathalyzer,  not by their actions, just by, you know, the math,  how much they've had to drink.  They're doing it in Fairfax, Virginia?  And then they blow into breathalyzer,  and then if they, they'll take them in for a truck of public  if they blow more into .08.  What the fuck?  I blew into a breathalyzer on last weekend,  and not, I wasn't pulled over or arrested.  It was recreation.  It was like fun, just for fun.  Where was it? 
[03:22:30]  Some of the bars have it.  No.  In a men's room.  Fuck!  There's no breathalyzer.  Where was it?  I was, I really can't say.  Oh, I know what you, all right, I know where you're going.  I, I, uh, well, I, I was fucking drunk, and I blew a 7, a .07, and maybe a two, something  like that.  It was definitely not.  You were still legal then at that point, right?  I was still legal.  I could have driven.  And I was fucking hammered.  Wow.  It may be confident, though.  Next time I have a good buzz on, I'm just going to hop in the car and drive home. 
[03:23:00]  Do you guys remember the bars that had the breathalyzers in them?  Yep.  And it just made you drink more, because then you and your buddies are trying to see who  could blow them up.  It was a contest.  Yeah.  They actually put it in bars, like, as a responsibility, so you could, like.  Yeah, and then you want to get high score.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you're in place high score, instead of, like, using it responsibly.  Dude, you're a fucking pussy.  Someone gave me one of those pocket breathalyzers to carry around, and we brought it down to  Costa Rica with us.  I was blowing, like, three times the legal limit when I woke up. 
[03:23:30]  Like, eight hours sleep, and I'm blowing, like, 0.24.  Oh, damn.  Oh.  Those are some long nights.  Oh, that is funny.  That's got to be a massive hangover.  But it makes you realize, like, how many times was I driving over the limit the next day?  Oh, yeah.  Thinking that's just a hangover you're smelling.  Oh, there are times, like, driving in the morning, when you're like, oh, boy.  Yeah.  I'm still fucking drunk.  Yeah.  Should not fucking be driving.  All right.  But, wow, a lot of phone calls. 
[03:24:00]  We'll go right back to the phones.  Having a fine second half here on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, just had to get there and talk about something.  Big, huge comeback.  That's what radio's about, if you ask me.  Doug Stanhope at Caroline's all weekend long here in New York City.  212-757-4100.  Yes, Jimmy.  Who?  Oh.  Regular Joe.  Regular Joe has something.  Yeah, well, you know, I do radio, but people tell me I got a face for radio.  I know it's regular Joe, Jimmy. 
[03:24:30]  Fine.  I do radio, but people tell me I got a face for radio.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  Of O.P. and Anthony's.  Sirius 197.  The virus.  XM 202.  Nina in her pajamas.  Oh, Kev's sore.  Yeah, put her in the pajamas.  She's already in her pajamas.  We'll see what that looks like next.  Keep her in the office until we're ready for her. 
[03:25:00]  Is she okay, or does she now have two holes in her neck?  Hey, Jimmy, I don't want...  I just saw our intern leave the office she was in.  Oh.  I don't want anyone leaving, Jimmy.  What's the transcript about, just in case people haven't heard us talking about this week?  Very famous case in Canada.  Yeah, Paul and Carla Bernardo were a married couple who kidnapped and raped and videotaped  sex with two girls in Toronto, around Toronto. 
[03:25:30]  The girls were 15 years old.  It really is a sickening crime.  The guy's in jail for life.  They didn't realize how heavily involved the wife is voluntarily until afterwards they found  videotapes once the deal had been struck.  And they were also involved in killing Carla's sister, Tammy, who was also 15.  Carla drugged her at a family function so Paul could fuck her.  And she died.  I think that death was accidental.  They didn't mean to kill her.  And so for the rest of their marriage, Paul would make Carla talk like she was Tammy. 
[03:26:00]  And they would always talk about the dead sister.  It's really, really...  I've seen photos of Tammy dead.  It's like choked on her own puke or whatever, autopsy show.  It was just horrible and creepy.  And yet when you read what went on, and I had a girlfriend agree with me.  I read the book on them.  Some of the details, some of the things are really sexy.  And it's not about hurting the women.  The thing that's sexy to me at least is that Carla is such a fucking dirty girl.  Yes, she is. 
[03:26:30]  Carla is a dirty girl.  And we got the transcript of one of the...  One of the porno tapes she found with just Paul and Carla.  All right.  Let's get the cast in here.  We got to roll here.  It's quarter up already.  Yeah, let's go.  We got some sexy business to get to.  Where's baby doll Francine?  I want to see her in her little PJs.  That E-Roc gave her.  Her pajamas, as she says.  Is there going to be an audience for this?  Oh.  Great.  Wow.  Way to make it as unsexy as possible.  She's dressed like fucking Manny in Scarface when Pacino shoots him. 
[03:27:00]  That are hef.  You look like a lioness.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Oh, nice material.  Oh, I bet you the butt feels good in this.  Yeah, can you feel your butt?  There you go, Jimmy.  Who's your pal?  You are.  Thank you, Opie.  You have old lady panties on.  Francine, why don't you wear thongs?  No, I don't like thongs.  How about boy shorts?  No, but these are cute.  These are pink panties.  Ooh.  From Vicky's.  Okay. 
[03:27:30]  Vicky's.  Victoria's Secret.  I'm going to take you shopping there.  Really?  Yeah.  If you model stuff for me, I don't even have to have sex with you.  I'll just watch.  Okay.  Done.  You're serious, right?  Oh, yeah.  All she'll have to do is come over and put the stuff on and let me look at her at it.  I won't touch her.  You'll be all fulled up.  Can you please videotap that?  Yeah.  I'll buy her a couple hundred dollars worth of stuff.  Whatever she wants.  Jacking it.  That's a deal.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course I'll jack it.  But so what?  She's going to have to look.  Just turn around and talk.  That's right. 
[03:28:00]  Face away.  When you hear me go, count to ten and turn back around.  All right.  We got the transcript.  All right.  And this is my, I'm the, I'm the, you're a long-suffering narrator.  You're the narrator.  Here's an account of Bernardo Homoka video clip played in court during Bernardo's murder trial.  These tapes were to be played on two 30-inch video monitors at the front of the gallery,  one on each side of the courtroom.  The sets were on a six-foot-high platforms that were directly sheathed in a somber black cloth. 
[03:28:30]  There were also two huge television sets in front of the jurors.  Just before the tape was turned on that morning, Judge Lasarge looked down at the gallery that was filled to capacity and issued a warning.  I want to caution the audience that what you're about to see next is explicit.  If you wish to remain, you can.  Nobody moved.  Play it, please, said Crown Prosecutor Ray Houlihan.  The first scene had been...  Pulling out his cock.  Yeah.  He heard...  Play it.  The first scene had been taped to the basement recreation room of the Homoka house not long after Tammy Lynn's death. 
[03:29:00]  Carla Homoka was on her back, lying on a rug before the fireplace, naked.  Her legs spread wide apart while she masturbated for the camera, which was positioned a few feet away at knee level and pointed directly at her vagina.  Whoa.  Gasps of surprise and disgust, perhaps even shock, along with plenty of embarrassed giggles, could be heard throughout the courtroom as the camera lingered on Homoka's exposed body for several minutes while she stimulated herself. 
[03:29:30]  Too many in the courtroom showing that particular video seemed an amazing way for the Crown to treat the woman who was scheduled to be their chief witness.  She was testifying against Paul.  I just threw that in.  Yeah.  For the previous two years, ever since her arrest, Homoka's face had been almost as well known as the prime minister's.  She had been seen on television in footage taken at her wedding with her friends and at her trial.  There had been countless photographs of her in newspapers and magazines around the world.  But few people in the courtroom that day were expecting to see a triple X-rated tape, a close study of the country's most infamous woman in a variety of sexually explicit positions. 
[03:30:00]  The prosecutors, though, had their reasons for showing the video.  On it, she and Bernardo talked about the death of Tammy Lynn.  Although Bernardo's trial for her death might well follow his trial for first-degree murder, the Crown wanted to present evidence on Tammy's death as part of its general picture of the relationship between the two.  Homoka's dialogue on the tape, Houlihan had said in his opening address, had been scripted by Bernardo.  That is, Bernardo had told her what to say when she was on camera, and if she didn't obey him, she was punished with a beating. 
[03:30:30]  But what the court saw was a seemingly relaxed Homoka, pulling down her husband's pants, fondling his penis, which she called snuggles.  Snuggles.  Aw.  And then performing fellatio during most of the tape, stopping every now and then to talk about what happened to her dead sister.  Holy shit.  Now, here comes the dialogue with Francine playing Carla, our own Steve playing Paul, which Paul is actually probably nicer to him than Steve is in real life, and I will continue to play the narrator. 
[03:31:00]  All right.  Now, I just want to give you a little direction here.  This isn't just reading.  This isn't just reading.  It's acting.  Acting.  You have now got to deliver these lines.  This is verbatim from an actual videotape.  You will now deliver these lines as if you were in this situation.  And these are the people.  Look at how hot she is.  She's a sexy girl. 
[03:31:30]  She's a beautiful Carla.  And Paul's a handsome dude.  I thought they were like older creeps.  I don't know anything about this one.  Oh, you didn't see?  Look at the front, dude.  No, I saw the picture.  Oh, my God, yeah.  I thought they were just an old creepy couple.  They were like one of those couples that everybody said, oh, they're the perfect couple.  Look at them.  Really good looking.  Young, good looking.  Have the world by the balls.  Yeah.  And oof.  Yeah.  This looks good.  Go ahead, baby.  This is now the beginning of the tape.  This is with Carla talking to Paul. 
[03:32:00]  She had pulled down her husband's pants, fondling snuggles, and then performing fellatio during most of the tape.  I'm talking about what happened to her dead sister, and...  Go.  Action.  I loved it when you fucked my little sister.  Homoka said to Bernardo, who was lying on his back beside the roaring hearth, moaning softly while she rubbed his penis.  I loved it when you fucked Tammy.  I loved it when you took her virginity.  You're the king.  I loved it when you put snuggles up her ass. 
[03:32:30]  Bernardo could be seen reaching for his drink while Homoka continued to fondle his penis.  She did it for several minutes, but he never climaxed.  He took a sip from his drink, glancing at the back of her head while she worked on him, and asked about the thoughts on the night Tammy died.  How did you feel?  I felt proud. 
[03:33:00]  I felt happy.  She replied.  What else?  I felt horny.  It's my mission in life to make you feel good.  This is why I'm gonna marry her.  Bernardo said, looking at the camera and holding up his drink while Homoka continued to perform fellatio.  Skull to the king.  I'm glad you made me lick her cunt.  Homoka continued after pausing to take a break from the oral sex.  Are you a fully-fledged dyke?  Bernardo asked, a reference to Homoka having sex with her sister. 
[03:33:30]  No, I'm not.  You were having sex with your little sister.  That was different.  It was my little sister.  She replied, stroking his penis.  Love in the family.  Bernardo said, do you believe in that concept?  You know, I had a fun, I had fun doing it.  Homoka said, you know, I liked it.  What did it teach you?  Well, we like little girls. 
[03:34:00]  I like you to fuck them.  If you're gonna fuck them, then I'm gonna lick them.  All the little girls.  What age should they be?  Thirteen.  Why?  Because it will make you happy.  But why thirteen?  That's a good age.  Because why?  He persisted.  Because they'll still be virgins.  What are you saying?  Bernardo asked, looking down at Homoka's head.  She stopped to look up at him. 
[03:34:30]  I'm saying I think you should fuck them and take their virginity.  Break their hymens with snuffles.  They're all our children.  And I think you should make them ours even more.  You're right, Bernardo said.  You're absolutely right.  That's a good idea.  When did you come up with it?  Just now.  She replied.  She resumed the oral sex for a while longer.  Then stopped and told Bernardo she had a surprise for him.  She walked past the camera to her bedroom.  Beside the rec room. 
[03:35:00]  Came back with a paper bag a few minutes later.  And sat down beside Bernardo.  Inside the bag was a brassiere and a pair of panties.  It's Tammy's.  She said, handing him the bra.  He smelled it while she began stroking his penis with the underwear.  Before resuming the fellatio.  A few minutes later, when he still hadn't reached climax.  She stopped and continued talking about her dead sister.  I want to rub Tammy's underwear all over your body.  She said and did so.  It'll make you feel so good. 
[03:35:30]  I'm so glad you took our virginity, Paul.  I wish we had four kids, Paul.  Yes?  So you could fuck each one of them.  How does the king like that?  She asked, stroking his penis rapidly with her sister's underwear.  Yeah.  He replied in obvious pleasure.  She continued for several minutes, but when he never climaxed, she said.  I think the king should turn over.  He did as he was instructed.  Okay.  He said.  Because this little slave has some more things to say and do. 
[03:36:00]  Bernardo rolled off his back and got down on his hands and knees while Homoka positioned  herself behind him.  She then probed with one hand for his anus and began licking it while she stroked his penis  with her other hand.  She did this for several minutes, and he moaned in pleasure, at times calling her his little  ass licker.  When he failed to reach a climax, they changed positions yet again.  Bernardo lay on his back again and rested his hands behind his head.  Homoka took a long-stemmed rose from a nearby vase and dragged it slowly across his chest  and then up and down his erect penis. 
[03:36:30]  You know what we're going to do with this?  She asked, holding up the rose.  We're going to take this to Tammy's tomorrow and put it on her grave.  Why?  Because it will give you pleasure.  You loved her.  She loved you.  You were her favorite, you know.  The things that you did, you know, I loved it.  The way you fucked her in, what, 60 seconds?  She loved it.  She loved it.  Your titties are bigger than hers. 
[03:37:00]  I know.  Want me to do that again?  No.  And they taste better.  He said.  When Tammy was alive, what did you used to do?  You made me lick it.  She replied, resuming the oral sex.  And suck it.  And now I'm doing it on my own because I loved it, Paul.  I loved everything you did with her.  She was your little play toy.  And we both loved her so much. 
[03:37:30]  Yes.  Homolka agreed, fondling his penis again.  Line?  Two.  Oh.  It wasn't highlighted.  That's you right there.  Our little virgin.  She loved us.  What else?  I didn't give you my virginity, so I gave you Tammies instead.  I loved you enough to do that.  Homolka then talked about another time Bernardo had brought a young girl home and had sex with 
[03:38:00]  her in the basement of her parents' house while she watched.  You fucked her.  Homolka said.  With this.  She gazed at his penis, tenderly stroking it.  You fucked her cunt.  She said.  She sucked you.  She sucked snuffles.  She put it in her mouth like this.  After more minutes of oral sex with no climax, she continued.  You put her on her knees.  You fucked her.  And I let you do that because I love you.  Because you're the king. 
[03:38:30]  She rubbed his penis for several moments before saying.  I want you to do it again.  When?  This summer.  Because the weather is too bad in the winter.  If we can do that, then it's good.  Good.  He agreed.  If you want to do it 50 more times, we can do it 50 more times.  She said.  A reference to him bringing home more young girls.  If you want to do it every weekend, we can do it every weekend.  Whenever we can.  Because I love you.  Because you're the king. 
[03:39:00]  Because you deserve it.  Virgin cunts for me.  Bernardo chimed in.  Yeah.  Virgin's just for me.  It'll make me happy going from one cunt to another.  From one ass to another.  Will you help me get the virgins?  Yes.  I'll go in the car with you if you want.  If you think that's best.  Or I'll stay here and clean up afterwards.  I'll do everything I can because I want you to be happy.  Because you're the king. 
[03:39:30]  Bernardo still had in climax.  Tomoka shifted down towards his feet.  Oof, what's these?  He said.  She started sucking on his toes.  First one foot, then the other.  Gotta treat the king like a king.  She said.  Good.  And what else?  I'm your little cocksucker.  She said.  My nipples are so hard.  I'm your cunt.  Your little slut.  Your little ass licker.  Your little virgin.  It's good to be the king.  Bernardo said, looking at the camera and raising his glass again. 
[03:40:00]  Amolka licked the soles of his feet.  I'm your cunt licking slut.  She said.  The keeper of your virgins.  Your ass licking bitch.  And I love you.  I want to marry you.  And that's where the tape ended with Bernardo still unable to climax.  Crown Prosecutor Ray Houlihan said the video would be played again to enable the jurors to follow the dialogue on the second viewing with a transcript prepared by the police.  But before the monitors were turned on, many in the public gallery got up and left. 
[03:40:30]  They had seen more than enough of the illustrious couple on their first playing of the tape.  First of all, whoever got up and left was wiping cum out of their pants.  Faggots.  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  Now I think it's safe to nominate Carla for Good Egg of the Year award.  What a good egg.  The only bad part of that whole thing is that the little sister was involved and died. 
[03:41:00]  And the girls that they picked up were actually 15.  Now it's bad to do it with any chick, but they were also young girls.  But the sex between them two?  Oof.  Jesus Christ.  And the fact if the sister had lived and just been like woke up with a hangover, that would have been the hottest thing ever.  You made me lick her pussy.  Oh, what a dirty girl.  Filthy.  A filthy whore.  She's out, right?  Mm-hmm.  She did like 12 years.  She did 12 years.  These tapes were all discovered after the...  So what is she doing now?  Oh, the tapes of...  I don't know. 
[03:41:30]  Marrying some lucky bastard.  A little follow-up there would be nice.  Let's go to John in Pennsylvania.  John.  Yeah, I was wondering if you guys know any good doctors that could cut my cock off because  it's useless now.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, you're right.  Yuck.  Take care.  Steve sounded like, hello, Sidney.  It was like the movie phone guy.  Yeah.  I was trying to figure out.  I didn't know.  The movie guy?  In a world where people eat their sister's assholes. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  It's good to be the king.  Yeah.  It's good to be the king.  Let's go to Gary in Tennessee.  Gary.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  Anybody missing the point here?  Y'all are just giving Francine another reason to fantasize about Steve.  Yeah, a little bit.  I didn't connect that.  No, I didn't either.  Hot.  Yeah.  What did you think of the story there, Francine?  It would have been hotter if it wasn't her sister.  That's the only thing I think.  Talk about missing the point. 
[03:42:30]  No, because I started having sex when I was 14.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  How old was the guy?  19.  Yeah.  Real sex or blowjob sex?  No, it was real sex.  Oh, okay.  S?  Twice.  Little S?  Yeah.  When you were 14?  Mm-hmm.  Wow, twice in the S at 14.  Good girl.  Thank you.  You are really a nice girl.  I wonder I love you.  Thank you.  Jeepers.  Sense what a good egg you are.  Yeah, he got charged for a statutory rape. 
[03:43:00]  He did?  Ooh.  She's such a blabbermouth.  She probably told everyone, Dad, guess what?  You're talking to me in the ass.  He did?  No.  You know how my mom found out?  He accidentally left the condom on top of the television set?  That's a good place.  When he left, and my old sister picked it up and went to the bedroom and dangled it in  front of my mom, and that's how-  Was it used?  Yeah.  It was used?  Dangled a used condom?  Yeah.  She was-  Was it empty?  Did she squeeze it out like space food?  Did your mom smell it and go, Francine? 
[03:43:30]  No.  She knew it was me.  I mean, I'm the only older- I'm the oldest girl in the house, so-  So she called the police?  Yep.  And did he go to jail?  Yeah, I think he-  You were 14, he was 19?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  How old did he go to jail for?  I think it was like three days, and his mom bailed him out.  Three days?  Do you guys keep dating?  Yeah, we still fucked anyway.  He lived-  Why not?  He lived downstairs.  Oh.  Wow.  Jeepers.  Was he white?  No, he was black.  Aw. 
[03:44:00]  It's a shame.  Sorry to hear that.  Did you give him hummers?  Must have hurt.  I didn't like doing that back then, but I did, like, once or twice.  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to the wizard in Wisconsin.  Did you fit in half the head in your mouth?  No, he-  Jimmy, you're a sick fucker.  Get that pop tent put away.  I don't have a pop tent.  I got one myself.  Yeah, it's hard not to.  A pop tent.  Oh, my God, man.  That's fucking sick shit.  So I just moved it out and made it consenting fucking like rabbit thing. 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Look, whatever you need to do, sir, just take care of snuffles.  A whack-bag name taken yet?  I'm sure it will be.  Riven Ryder, I think.  Riven Ryder?  Yeah, how's it going, boys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, Carla there, ever since she got out of prison, has just been running around trying  to avoid the media.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, the papers there have been posting rewards for pictures and her address and wherever she  is, and she's got confidential agreement so the police can't publish her address and 
[03:45:00]  whatnot.  Huh.  Do they know what she's doing for, like, a living, or?  Nothing right now.  She's just hiding at her parents' place, and that's it.  I'd pay her.  She was.  Yeah.  She was writing letters to a guy in Montreal who's in a prison who's sex-fiended as well.  Montreal.  Really?  Yeah.  So she's into all this shit.  It's obvious from the transcripts.  She is one freaky bitch.  Maybe, well, listen, we're on in Montreal, so maybe she has XM.  Maybe her parents have it. 
[03:45:30]  Maybe she's a fan, and after that reading, she wants to call in.  Yeah, Carla, you know, you're more than welcome to come for a visit here in New York, do the  walkover with us.  Have you seen a picture of her lately since she got out of prison, though?  No.  Yeah, she looked okay, right?  She kind of chunked up a little bit.  She's not as hot as what you were looking at there before.  Well, dude, she could, but she's as long as the same person's inside the head.  As long as between the ears hasn't changed.  Wow.  That lunatic is supposed to.  There's some odyssey for you.  All right, Riven.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  All right, let's say hi to Mike in Tennessee. 
[03:46:00]  Mike, what's up?  Hey, man.  Man, y'all just blew HBO's version out of the water.  Whenever they had it on autopsy, they took all the sexiness and anything out of it.  Congratulations, Francine.  That was the actual transcript right there.  Yep.  Oh, man.  All right.  Wade in Toronto.  Wade.  We haven't heard from you in a while, Wade.  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Ideal, Wade.  Hey, those are some sweet numbers.  The last fellow that called was telling you that she's roaming around. 
[03:46:30]  She's not roaming around.  She's in Montreal.  She can't move around.  That's one of her stipulations.  She was working in a hardware store, and she ended up getting fired from there because the owner had two sons underage,  and she's not allowed to be around underage people.  Hmm.  All right.  There you go.  There's the update.  All right, Wade.  Thank you.  I would have hired her.  All right.  Let's go to Daphne.  I need an assistant.  I need a Canadian assistant, Carla.  Someone talk to Carla.  Tell her to email me. 
[03:47:00]  I'll hire her as my assistant.  This is Bob Kelly, and you're listening to The Worst Of on ONA.  That sounded good.  You're supposed to say, what?  Opie and Anthony?  The Worst Of Opie and Anthony.  The Worst Of Opie and Anthony.  Thanks.  Thanks for telling me what I was supposed to say.  Hey, just wing it.  And I wung it, and then you fucking winged it right back in my face.  Good for you, Steve.  You fucking jack off.  Hey, why do you? 
[03:47:30]  Hey, Bob, just wondering why you stink on all your things.  I don't know, because Steve just sits there, push a button, puts headphones on, and then  fucking shows me his ball sack and helps me nothing.  Okay?  How's that sound?  The fuck, dude?  I'm only good when there's a crowd of more than five people, and we're in a basement.  I'm kidding.  Come here.  Say something.  This is Bob Kelly, and you are listening to Opie and Anthony.  On XM Cellar Radio.  Hey, this is Rob Kelly, and?  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio. 
[03:48:00]  Do you always speak like you're reading something off a wall?  Listen, here, we'll do it again.  This is Bob.  Hey, this is Bob Kelly, and?  This is Francine.  And you're listening to the worst of on Opie and Anthony.  Jesus.  What?  Just say it.  I suck cock.  You do, and you have abortions.  Oh, lots.  I only had one abortion.  Well, it was a fake abortion.  It wasn't a fake.  A little head came out of you.  I don't give a shit.  I don't care.  All right, this is.  Thanks, Bob. 
[03:48:30]  Jesus Christ, you just hit me like fucking Joe Frazier.  This is Bob Kelly, and you're listening to the worst of of Opie and Anthony.  I fucked it up.  This is Bob.  I fucked it up because it's.  Let me read it.  Here we go.  Ready?  We're just going to do a one shot.  Ready?  And this is what we should do in the beginning.  Here we go.  From now on, Steve.  Ready?  I walk in here.  Hey, what do you.  Hey, can you do a worst of?  And you go, yeah.  What do you want me to do?  Read.  Just read this, Bob, and add your name underneath the line where it's blank.  Okay?  So this is what I'll do.  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:49:00]  Well, you fucked that up, too.  How'd I fuck that up?  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to worst of Opie and Anthony.  Well, dude, I'm not a radio fucking pro like you.  The worst.  The worst.  You got big muscles, but you got small hips.  Listen.  All right.  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  Oh.  Hey.  This is Bob Kelly, and you're listening to the worst.  No.  Hey, this is Bob Kelly, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Thank you. 
[03:49:30]  Was that good?  Perfect.  I got it good?  You did?  Are you shitting me?  Nope.  Play that back.  Half the shit we talked about during the break, or Louie was, should be on the radio.  I know.  We should shut up during the break.  The dominatrix, that's terrific.  Are you blowing up someone's spot by mentioning the person?  Don't say his name.  I won't say his name, but my friend's wife was a dominatrix, and she used to have Hasidic  Jews as clients a lot.  And they'd be very...  Well, hold on.  Your friend was going to this dominatrix and decided this is the woman for him. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  Which is so bizarre, because you had a great line there.  You know, he basically married someone that burned his dick.  He married a woman who literally burnt his dick with a hot poker.  And that made him go, I'm in love.  Does she still dominate him?  No, not anymore.  I mean, I don't know.  That gets in the air.  You got to think that would be a little weird.  He's got to go out of the house to get that.  Well, the thing is that then it just turned into a regular.  They got married.  They have a kid.  She's a pain in the ass, and he's bleeding.  Literally? 
[03:50:30]  Literally?  I mean, I don't know.  Or fucking with a racket.  It just became like, it doesn't matter what they do beforehand, because that's the ultimate.  You know, a dom and a fucking slave.  It doesn't matter.  Once they're married, they become the married couple.  He's taking the garbage out.  Exactly.  There's no cool, ethereal, sexual thing.  Do you promise to love, honor, and shit in his mouth?  I do.  For as long as he shall crawl and be scum.  Until he says his safe word. 
[03:51:00]  Does anyone object to this marriage?  A guy stands up in a baby costume.  It would be great if you could have a safe word in a marriage.  You could just sit in the middle of marriage and say, thumbtack.  She's like, oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I went too far with this argument.  I didn't realize.  I didn't realize we were crossing the line.  No.  But she said that she's having...  Shouldn't the safe word be cunt, though?  Yeah, it should be.  That is.  That's the argument.  Starts a new one.  So you were saying that she had a lot of Hasidic Jews that were her clients, and that during  the business transaction, before they would fall into their role play, they were very rude 
[03:51:30]  to her, the Hasids, because they can be rude.  They're good businessmen.  Anybody who's not them, you're outsiders.  Like, if you ever go to a store run by Hasids, they don't care that you exist.  They just, you know...  Yeah.  You know, it's just...  It's a different...  It's a closed society.  I'm trying to be nice about it, fucking Jews.  Well, it is very...  Jesus.  It is a very different and closed society.  Right.  Yeah.  Do you know any Hasidic Jews personally?  Have you ever been to their houses? 
[03:52:00]  Do you know...  No.  ...friends with them or anything?  Well, they're not supposed to.  They're not supposed to mix with other people.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  So it's not like you're saying anything that isn't true.  It's just no one knows.  They're very mysterious, if you ask me.  And it's a generality, because there are...  I mean, I go to B&H Photo, which is...  Oh, yeah.  I love B&H.  And B&H, they sometimes, they're very like, you go, is this a good camera?  It's a very good camera.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, it is.  You know, yes, it's good.  And I'm like, all right, sorry.  But sometimes the guy's like, it's excellent. 
[03:52:30]  It's excellent.  I can tell you about it, and they'll be nice, you know, sometimes.  But if you poke them for information, they all have it.  Oh, sure.  They all know.  They're good employees.  Like, if you say, why is this better?  Make them work, and they'll always tell you.  Sure they know.  They'll sell.  I get all my video stuff from there, and every time I've gone there, it's been great.  It's not a commercial of the place, but...  No, it's great.  It is a great place.  But anyway...  Informative.  But so, these Jews were rude to her a lot, and they're already, they're living in a society  that's extremely, like, moralistic, going to some dominatrix and having their dicks whipped. 
[03:53:00]  It's not exactly in the Talmud.  Within the bounds of their religion.  I don't think it's part of their bar mitzvah.  In the barul hata, you know, it's not in...  There's no Hebrew for, you know, getting your dick whipped.  Fuck me with a strap on.  Right.  Jesus, Louis.  So, there's just something about...  I think it's something about any lifestyle that has you in this very strict parameters as 
[03:53:30]  to what you can and can't do.  You're going to do something crazy.  You're going to fucking be the nut, whether it's a strict Catholicism.  Yeah.  Or Jimmy Swagger jacking off on a hooker's ass.  Yeah.  Of course he is.  Of course he is.  And shit like that, whenever you're put in that situation, you're going to fucking want  to get a little freaky.  Yeah.  Get your freak on.  Yeah.  And if you wanted to go to Adama...  So, he went to this...  These guys would go to her and she...  Usually, you know, you talk as two normal people before you start the hitting and stuff.  And that's her time that you've got to respect her. 
[03:54:00]  And they were disrespectful to her.  So, when she was beating them, she said they were the only clients that she ever hit, like,  with spite.  Because that's a huge line for her.  She would never cross.  When Adama is beating you up, she's being very...  You know, she's doing it with some kind of kindness.  There's a weird...  That's correct.  But she used to...  Ava Vaughn.  She said she used to crucify them.  Oh!  That's a no-no.  And, like, inside, when she's hitting them, she'd be like, you fucking chew.  He gave you so much shit.  Wow! 
[03:54:30]  And then the weird detail she told me was that they always had to take their sperm home with  them in a tissue.  Get out of here.  Because that was in their religion, was they couldn't leave their bodily fluids behind.  What do they do with it?  But somehow, like, God's watching a dominatrix shit in your mouth, and he's...  Well, look, as long as you take your cum home, it's fine.  Someone's trying to bother God for a second, and then he's like, no, no, wait, wait, wait,  wait, wait, wait, wait.  I got...  I got it.  All right.  He took his cum with him.  Okay.  All right.  He's still good.  I thought he was going to leave his cum on her floor, and that would have really pissed 
[03:55:00]  me off.  As long as he puts it in that cigar box under his wife's shawl.  That's why the tsunami happened.  God wasn't paying attention to the weather.  He was watching some Jewish fella jerk off into a Kleenex and fucking bring on the N-train.  And bring on the N-train.  Fucking...  Taking it on the Jay-Z to the fucking Bensonhurst.  I knew another Dom who used to see the same thing.  She said that instead of clients, one would always come and one of the tranny to fuck  him. 
[03:55:30]  So she would bring the tranny, and the tranny would a lot of times make the guy shower.  She's like, they were dirty.  They would smell.  And she would be said that the tranny wouldn't fuck the guy until he showered.  Wow.  The tranny guy, I ain't gonna fuck the guy.  Let's take a shower.  It's disgusting.  Let's get Keith the cop on the line here.  Keith, what's up?  Yeah, that's very true, Jimmy.  Big, big in the tranny community.  We used to catch them all the time.  They would go out and they would look to suck the he, she's dicks.  Really?  Yeah.  Those naughty, naughty boys.  Yeah, and you know what?  They would get robbed a lot because they would be embarrassed to go and report that they 
[03:56:00]  got robbed.  All right, yeah.  The community, they'd get the backlash from it, so they would just...  I was being fucked by a transvestite, and the fellow took my wallet, and I went to file  a report.  Yeah, so we would catch them a lot, but yeah, filthy, filthy animals.  Jesus.  You know, like the rest, I'm not saying them in particular, but you know, they just happened  to a couple of them.  Yeah.  A couple of them. 
[03:56:30]  A couple.  A couple, too.  All right, Keith.  All right, Keith, I wish you were there in Atlantic City to drag me away from the table.  Well, you know, you got a call.  Yeah.  I'll be out there and pick you up.  I know.  But homeless shopping, we're going to start doing a couple interviews.  Oh, very good.  Bring them by.  I'm on the street doing them, and we'll bring one in maybe later this week.  Let's go to David in North Carolina.  David, what's up?  Oh, you were talking about your fees a while ago.  When I lived in New York, I used to work for a moving company.  We were moving some of them, and they wouldn't even offer a glass of water. 
[03:57:00]  And when we were done, after two days moving their stuff, they didn't even offer a tip.  But when we were moving a dresser, me and one of the other guys, one of the drawers fell  out on the floor.  It still had clothes in it, and there was an envelope in there.  We opened it up, and look.  Let's just say me and him got a tip.  Probably between the two of us, break close to $500.  That's great.  You're a dirty thief with no excuse.  People being rude to you and not giving you water doesn't mean you get to steal $500, 
[03:57:30]  you fucking asshole.  Screw that G.  So he didn't.  We nailed that G for $500.  In the end, I got that G.  G boy.  He didn't say good morning, so that means I can look through a personal envelope and  steal money.  Yeah, the drawer just like, it fell out.  That's what happened.  You fucking ignorant thief.  He went through his drawers.  You're implying if he gave you water, you would never have looked in that envelope.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, he did give us a glass of water. 
[03:58:00]  Well, we ought to cook some anyway, water or no water, because they didn't give us shit  after three days of work in our hands.  Oh, now we got the story.  Now, hold on.  I had to take all his jewelry because he didn't offer me a sandwich.  But that's what it really, if you always, it always comes down to the person's personal  day, because really, now he's telling us the story.  He was tired.  He was lifting beds and shit.  Yeah.  He didn't like his life.  It's not the career he had chosen, so he stole some.  He found an excuse to steal some Jews' money. 
[03:58:30]  His story falls apart, though.  Yes, because.  Dude, if you were still moving.  Yeah.  How did you know they weren't going to tip you when you were done?  That's very true.  When we were done, they didn't give us nothing.  But you were moving.  Yeah, but you stole the money before you knew.  Yeah, you were moving the dresser still.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah, maybe.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Maybe that money.  Hold on.  Maybe that money was your tip money.  Yeah.  That was.  Maybe he put it aside for a tip, but they're actually very considerate. 
[03:59:00]  You fuck.  What an asshole.  What happened to the $500?  Oh, I see.  They must have stole it.  They stole their own tip.  We can't tip them.  Well, my wife is from Westchester, and we moved out of there in 99, and this was probably  like, oh, probably three years prior to that, but I mean, it didn't make me.  96.  They'd never see it until it was too late anyway.  Yeah, so good for you.  All right.  So now those Hasids also have a prejudiced thing about guys from North Carolina. 
[03:59:30]  Exactly.  They take your money.  They don't care.  They take your money.  I'm not from North Carolina either, so.  All right, Goomer.  I moved up there in 94 when I met my wife, and I'm sorry.  The story's awful.  The story's awful.  I have cleaning people in my house right now, as we're talking about guys going through  your drawer, and I know they go through my drawers, and I have $480,000 in fucking  nickels I have under my pillow.  Under your pillow.  There's a little bump.  Back then, it was good money. 
[04:00:00]  I didn't care.  All right.  Take care, sweetie.  The cleaning crew that comes in my house must just have no clue what I'm all about.  They're all Mexican, I believe, and they come in, and they wear the little backpack  vacuums that look like Buck Rodriguez, and just kind of go around the house.  They're probably Central American.  Go ahead.  Probably.  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  Not Mexican like you, Louis C.K.  No, not like me, no.  I have never seen a redhead come in.  You just insulted Louis.  No, I just wanted to be clear.  I assume they were Mexican. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  Because they're shorter in stature than normal people.  Yeah.  Oh, I mean Americans.  Humans.  Humans.  Louis's next HBO special should be shot in a box truck.  And I wonder if they go through my drawers and shit like that because-  They don't.  I can tell you they don't.  What are you saying about Mexicans?  They don't because they're little tiny Catholic people, and they're terrified of God, and they  have real morals. 
[04:01:00]  Well, they're very nice.  They're better than us.  They're very nice.  They would never do that.  They would kill themselves before they would do that.  And the guns that are all over the place.  I'm wondering if that shakes them up a little bit.  There's guns around your-  Oh, Louis, I love the gun.  And you leave them around?  I love it.  They're laying around everywhere.  That's the best part about not having kids.  Yeah.  I could leave loaded weapons all over the house.  Right.  And believe me, I do.  Because you don't know where someone's going to come from.  They go through your drawers. 
[04:01:30]  He must love children.  He has so many pictures of children.  I can't believe he has so many nieces and nephews.  And they play very nicely together, the boys and the girls.  You just got to wonder.  I know the other day, and I felt bad about this.  I don't like when they have to clean up gross stuff or stuff they'd consider gross or anything.  I try to keep all that stuff to a minimum.  I'm going to clean it up myself, things like that.  I don't know what that would be, but go ahead. 
[04:02:00]  Well, let's say I have a cold, and I've been blowing my nose and leaving snotty tissues on my night table.  I'm going to pick those up, if I know the cleaning crew's coming in, and throw them in the garbage.  Right.  I don't want them rifling through my snotty tissues.  That's why MSCs don't use Mexicans to clean their place, because they'll throw away-  You threw my cum away, you fucking-  You dirty spit.  You threw away my cum.  What am I going to say to God now, you fucking dirty spit?  I'm going to burn because of you?  Because of some idiot? 
[04:02:30]  You threw away my jism.  That was from 83, I came in that.  Where does the Hasidic cum go?  That's a good question.  I don't know where they put it.  I'd love to find that out.  Probably bring it home and burn it while they pray or something.  They got to put that strap on their hand.  Do we have anyone that's-  Yeah, and pray.  Are any Hasidians can tell us what you do with your cum?  Yeah, find out what they do with their cum.  With your horror cum.  Is Ronnie B. an expert on Hasidic cum?  I don't know.  Ronnie knows a lot, but I don't know if he's a Hasidic cum expert.  We might finally have something that's going to even stump the great Ronnie B. 
[04:03:00]  Ask Mr. Bennington.  I bet you Ron collects it.  I bet you he's got a fucking lumb tail full of Jewish cum in tissues.  Do they have to dispose of it a proper way, or do they collect it in a box or a big fucking-  I don't know.  I don't know.  A garbage bag in the closet?  Is it?  I only know.  I don't know the end user thing.  I just know what it was like for her.  I guess if you Google, you know, Jew cum, you probably get it.  Hasidic Jew cum.  Now, if you, like, orthodox Jewish laws bodily fluids. 
[04:03:30]  Bodily fluids.  Disposal.  Right, that would work.  Something like that.  That would work.  Really?  All right, I'm going to Google.  Something like that.  Well, anyway, I left the wrapper up there on the table, and the Mexicans I know came in,  and then it was gone after that, and they had to pick it up.  And even though it was just the wrapper part, I was like, ah, they probably, you know, what  goes through their head?  Well, it's a sin to them.  You like to think they're just machines that just go around your house like an automaton just  picking shit up and not thinking for themselves.  Nope.  But no, they probably would go like, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[04:04:00]  No, they don't laugh.  They get a little tear in the eye.  Really?  Oh, because I sinned.  Because you sinned, you took a child away from God.  I used that so I could have sex without the thought of procreation.  Yeah, and they don't like that too much.  And they cry.  They cry a little bit.  No crosses hanging in my house either.  No.  I should have a crucifix on there.  It's weird, though, when there's an acknowledgement of something dirty with somebody that you're  not even there when they, like, I had Playboys when I was a kid, and some of them weren't 
[04:04:30]  nice Playboys.  They were, like, fucking ugly, you know, Larry Flint-style shit.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, with just women who are fucking holding their vaginas open, like, gaping  asses.  Like a fucking raincoat.  Like a sailboat.  Yeah.  Fucking sailboat.  Fucking coming about with their left labia.  Like elephant ears, like Dumbo ears.  Yes, exactly.  Like fucking Dumbo ears.  Like they're showing the size of a shark's mouth.  Excuse me, we got a very important person on the line.  We can't let them work here. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, we'll continue that.  Ron Bennington, expert at large.  Ronnie B.  There he is.  I think we finally got one that's going to stump you there, Ronnie.  Oh, great.  Ronnie is always, I consider Ronnie very knowledgeable.  He's got a street knowledge that I've never seen in another person.  He's very intelligent, very witty, and just very knowledgeable about a lot of things. 
[04:05:30]  What do you know on the Hasidic Jews and their cum?  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  See, apparently.  Apparently, Louis C.K. in the studio, he's got a story about a dominatrix.  Some of her clients, excuse me, were Hasidic Jews, and they had to bring their cum back with them.  They had to take their cum behind.  They had to take their cum home with them in tissues because God would frown upon them leaving cum around.  My friends here, I had Hasidic Jews in my neighborhood. 
[04:06:00]  Oh.  Did they talk about that on the street, just like chatting?  Yeah, I did get a conversation.  And they will put their cum in a mayonnaise jar.  Ah, really?  Now, in the old days, it used to be a mason jar.  And cum that wasn't being used, they would send back to the Holy Land.  So, in the old days, they would put it in a mason jar, made sure it got back there.  Now you can just cum quickly in a mayonnaise jar. 
[04:06:30]  Okay.  And they keep it around the house or something?  Well, you stock it up, and then there was plenty of it.  You ship it out.  Oh, then you ship it out back to Israel.  Wow.  The Holy Land, yes.  Okay.  What happens to it in the Holy Land?  That's a good question.  They wouldn't tell me there.  I think I know.  I guess you've got to join.  You plant a tree in it.  Like they did Schindler's tree.  They do plant a lot of trees over there, so maybe they fertilize the tree.  I think they just throw it down at the Arabs from the whaling.  Like, you know what is that? 
[04:07:00]  Oh, God.  They throw jars of old cum at the Arabs.  I don't see a lot of trees over there for all the trees you say they're planting.  That's true.  Yeah, they plant a lot of trees, but it just looks like dirt.  They die.  That's why.  And then Jesus was a carpenter, and then you don't see any trees.  He might have just been a slacker.  Like, hey, I would be working.  That was some fucking wood.  That's why he did all that shit.  There was no work.  He was a shitty carpenter.  There was no work.  And he's like, all right, let's do something.  I was a son of God. 
[04:07:30]  Can't find any wood.  Can't build shit.  Was he a really good carpenter?  And he had, like, a big blue ox, and he was just knocking down tree after tree.  Could have been.  So the lack of trees could be from Jesus himself.  Because he was so large, and he was just knocking down trees.  Giant Jesus.  But also, there's that thing where a lot of the words from back then have been misinterpreted.  So it might be that carpenter was another word for, you know.  Jew.  A big faggot Jew. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah.  Carpenter meant Jew faggot, I think.  Oh, God.  In Aramaic.  Well, I don't know if he was gay, but he never saw him with a chick, really.  No, he didn't.  Not really.  No.  He had a girl, but, you know, usually some gay guys have girls to go shopping with and stuff.  Right.  And she was a heavy set girl.  Mary Magdalene.  Very cute.  She was a fag egg.  Mary Magdalene is the first fag egg.  Oh, God.  Are we in trouble?  And then at the end of the night, she was always going, why do you make me cry, Jesus? 
[04:08:30]  They love to act like their feelings got hurt by their gay friends.  Yeah.  What, fag hags?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't get that whole thing about, I mean, it's great for them to be friends and all.  I mean, what's wrong with that? </pre>
