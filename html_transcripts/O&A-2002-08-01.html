<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts discussing their massive new office space.  Complaints about inadequate desk space, particularly Anthony’s compared to Opie’s oversized desk (previously Scotso’s), and technical difficulties with Opie's computer dominated the initial conversation. The sheer size and layout of the office were repeatedly highlighted, along with the logistical challenges of navigating it and plans for renovations, including a spiral staircase.  The awkwardness of retrieving the office keys from a former occupant, Earl, was also recounted.

Following this, a humorous, profane phone impersonation of Mike Tyson ensued. The impersonation, replete with homophobic slurs and graphic sexual descriptions, centered on Tyson's upcoming fight with Lennox Lewis and his surprisingly cordial interaction with a gay rights activist.  The hosts’ laughter punctuated the segment, which explored Tyson's apparent evolving views on homosexuality and his unrestrained use of offensive language.

Next, comedian Jimmy Norton and Paul Mercurio joined the show. Mercurio was being filmed for BeThere.tv, and his attire, specifically white socks with sandals, became the target of relentless mockery from Opie and Norton.  The segment devolved into a series of insults and jokes aimed at Mercurio's clothing and Norton's Spider-Man t-shirt.  A phone call from Rich Voss further fueled the back-and-forth ribbing, including accusations and rumors about Mercurio and his work.  The conversation remained vulgar and offensive throughout this segment, punctuated by Mercurio’s anecdotes, which included stories of hikers surviving in South America thanks to a phone company solicitor, a prisoner escaping jail in a cardboard box, a turtle causing a swimming ban in Munich, and a swimmer encountering a giant turtle.  Amidst the insults and jokes, Mercurio unexpectedly exposed his genitals on camera, leading to more vulgar exchanges.  A caller, Joe from Philly, suggested an "I Heart Rhode Island" t-shirt, and Dustin Diamond called in to thank Mercurio.  The segment concluded with a discussion of bowel movements and bathroom-related anecdotes from the hosts and a crew member named Ben, and a promotion for the show's WOW (Women of Wrestling) contest.

The show then transitioned into a rambling discussion centered on bodily functions, specifically diarrhea and flatulence.  The hosts shared personal anecdotes about experiencing diarrhea in various locations, detailing the comical and uncomfortable aspects.  One host recounted a childhood incident involving Aquafresh toothpaste. This was followed by a series of listener calls and critiques of commercials, targeting what they perceived as stereotypical portrayals of ethnic groups and socioeconomic situations.  A Delta Airlines commercial with informal language was singled out, along with other commercials deemed to be targeted at specific demographics.

Two female police officers then entered the studio to cuff the hosts.  A timed physical altercation ensued between the hosts, a studio producer named Rick, and the officers, focusing on the techniques used by the officers and the hosts' resistance.

Finally, Ted Nugent called in.  The conversation covered Nugent's love of firearms, hunting, and preparing wild game, including descriptions of his extensive gun collection, gut piles, and less conventional food items.  He described his hunting methods and culinary adventures.  The segment included live firearm demonstrations from Nugent and callers Mike and Dave, who detailed their firearm collections and fired various weapons during the broadcast. Nugent fired a Glock 10mm and a .22-250 rifle, describing the sounds and effects. Nugent also promoted his book, "Kill It and Grill It," and upcoming tour.  The entire conversation was laced with vulgar language and references to hunting and firearms.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, New York.  No one has ever done anything like this.  I know you're out there.  I can feel you now.  I know that you're afraid.  You're afraid of us.  You're afraid of change.  I'm not what you think.  I'm going to hang up this phone,  and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. 
[00:00:30]  A world where anything is possible.  There is.  There's people being in there in the future alone.  Bye-bye, signal.  Unleash hell.  Welcome to the bottomless pit of Ignorance.  Here's a clip.  Jesus Christ, this is going to suck.  Is it mango or papaya?  That'll get our ratings up.  How are we supposed to win our ratings?  If we can't let our boo and our pleasure.  Suck it up. Walk it off, Dick.  Who are...  I love Camel Tone. 
[00:01:00]  The shaven for America.  Oh, ass.  I got to see that ass.  No!  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we've both already had AIDS.  Oh, ass.  Hope he says, it isn't bad.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We're a blitz.  Here's three old things.  I don't know anything, Shrello.  Rude, disgusting, self-centered pieces of trash.  You guys suck.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[00:01:30]  Thank God we get back to the...  Oh, okay, terrific.  Insert joke here.  The handy's great in a pinch.  Did I just hear that?  Hello.  Yes.  Pull your pants down.  Ew.  You got that ass.  You don't know anything, Shrello.  Number three, you popped up your chest, sir.  You're all burning it out, damn you.  Alcohol equals great radio.  Are you not entertained? 
[00:02:00]  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, it's the O&A Show.  What's wrong, Ed?  Who's responsible for plugging your computer in, your laptop, on my line?  Is it ever plugged in on my line?  Ever.  I'd have to say no.  No. 
[00:02:30]  Am I supposed to use this line?  This is just a cluster, Ed.  Well, soon we don't have to worry about any of that because we have decided,  we have decided something today, Anthony.  Wow.  In time, this is going to be our studio.  And all the other shows are going to have to broadcast somewhere else.  Yeah.  We got the big, huge office yesterday handed to us.  Our boss's, our boss, our office is bigger than any of the boss's offices. 
[00:03:00]  That office rocks, man.  I don't even know what part of the office you're hanging out in.  Have you seen me?  I haven't seen you yet.  It's great.  I was looking for you on the map, but then I got lost around Ben.  Yeah.  And I couldn't find you.  I think I got off the wrong exit.  This office is so big.  We have, what, five people that are hanging out in there?  Yeah, five people in the office.  And we pretty much need a telescope to see people.  It's great.  I actually, I called Opie to ask for directions to where his desk was.  Because we had to discuss some stuff. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  So I just call up.  Right.  We're in the same office.  I'm over here.  I was using the megaphone.  Oh, there you are.  It was so funny because Pete, Pete's been working for NAW for, I believe, screw Willard Scott.  I think Pete's been working longer than Willard Scott.  Pete's been here 40 years.  And I warned him today that there's going to be some more changes for the Opie and Anthony show.  First, I said, get the blueprints out because Ant and I want a spiral staircase that goes to the second story of our office. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  The spiral staircase.  So whoever has the office above us, because we take the ninth and tenth floor on this building, whoever has the office directly above us is going to have to vacate soon.  Yeah.  Because we're going to get a spiral staircase up to, like, a loft.  And that's where we'll, like, you know, do our movie watching before the show.  Well, you're going to watch me lose my effing mind.  I know.  I can't wait.  You're going to watch me lose my effing mind.  That's why I'm smiling.  I'm basically stalling because I know you're ready to lose it. 
[00:04:30]  Who?  I got to ask.  Who hooks up that laptop that Opie uses?  I don't know.  Does somebody else use that during the other day parts?  I would assume yes.  Can anyone give me an answer?  So why today, all of a sudden, did someone go, hey, you know, let me pull the wire over from where Anthony plugs his laptop in and plug Opie's in?  Let me just do that.  That's odd.  Wouldn't you say?  So now you can't plug yours in? 
[00:05:00]  Well, I'm working on it.  We'll see if it works.  I got a little green light here.  That's a good sign.  And you're getting an attitude.  You want too much from this place.  Dude, I'm so heavied up on some of these stocks.  I can't be offline for more than three minutes at a time.  Believe me.  Please trust me on this.  The only radio show in America where we do online trading as we broadcast.  Day trading as we're doing the show.  It's amazing.  You think we're kidding.  We're not. 
[00:05:30]  Like a bunch of the old jocks?  What did they used to do in the old days?  Pot?  Pot?  Maybe do a little Coke?  Yeah, possibly.  I'm trading.  Please.  I might be okay.  Well, let me look.  And am I getting online?  Okay, I'll use this wire until tomorrow.  You're online, right?  Yeah, that wire works.  And soon you won't have to worry about that because this is going to be our studio.  We're going to lock that door when we leave here and no one will touch our stuff. 
[00:06:00]  No one will be in here?  Then where are they going to broadcast?  From the other studio?  Wherever else they want.  We have one, two.  We have two other studios.  Each show should get their own studio.  We'd have our own studio.  Now, that's my goal.  That would rock.  We got the big office.  We want our own studio.  I told Pete to get the blueprints out.  I said, Pete, there's going to be changes around here soon.  We're going to want our own studio.  He was panicking because I don't think he's done anything in 40 years.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:30]  Come on.  The guy works hard.  I bust on him in the hallway every day.  He knows I'm kidding.  But I did tell him to get the blueprints out because we're ready to expand.  We're going to start blowing walls out.  Oh, he's talking about blowing walls out, too.  Like, you know where Earl just got moved?  Yeah.  Earl went from our office.  Which was huge.  Huge.  The huge office.  So we moved in there.  Earl.  No, wait, wait.  I got to stop you there because it was really funny.  Because the people that were in that office before us had to hand over their keys. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  It was very awkward.  Very degrading.  Because, like, I go to Pete.  Pete's in charge of pretty much everything.  Yeah.  As far as that stuff goes, I go, Pete, you know, Ant and I, we all need keys for the brand  new, big, huge office.  Mm-hmm.  And all of a sudden, he had to hunt down the keys, you know, instead of making new keys.  Earl, your keys, sir.  Right.  So Earl had to come into the office with his head down and hand over his key to us.  So now Earl is out in between our old office and our new office. 
[00:07:30]  Correct.  Our old office.  It's now occupied by Jeremy.  Our new boss.  Yes.  What's that about?  He wanted our old office.  No, I think he wanted to be a little closer to us.  Is that the truth?  I'm a little worried about that.  Well, it's, you know something?  You don't want the boss that close.  He's not much closer than he was before.  You sure?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, he is, I guess.  But we've got that buffer.  That buffer of cubicles that Earl now does his work in.  You know that area?  Yeah.  So now in the future, we're planning on blowing the wall out, taking over the area that is 
[00:08:00]  the cubicles, and blowing out the boss's office, which used to be our office, and making  that whole area our office.  And making a, we're going to put a wall in, and we're going to be completely separated  from the entire station.  We're like Hitler in Europe, back in the old days.  We just keep conquering offices.  That's what we're doing.  We're marching.  Goose-stepping our way down the hallways.  That's right.  Taking over the offices.  I like our new office, though.  So Pete was panicking, because I'm sitting there telling him, we're going to lose this 
[00:08:30]  wall here.  We're going to need a spiral staircase in the corner to go up to the second story of our  office.  That's going to be a loft.  Yeah.  And then I go, and I go, Pete, be prepared.  You're going to have to rewire this whole station, because Aunt and I are taking over the main  studio soon.  You know what?  I'm a little unhappy with, Opie.  You say I'm getting a little out of hand.  A little bit?  Well, I got something to take up with you here about the office.  Okay.  Desk space.  You don't use desks.  Well, let me set the scene for the people at home. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  Opie has this huge, wood, like President Clinton, Oval Office desk in the office.  It's huge.  It was Scotso's old desk.  It's the big desk.  It's the big desk.  We used to have, like, four people working off this desk.  It was so big.  Now, my desk is a little rolling computer table thing with my computer on it.  My huge monitor that takes up the whole desk.  I have no desk space.  So, I was saying yesterday, I go, perhaps I should have a desk somewhere in a corner 
[00:09:30]  of this huge office.  Opie's like, Aunt, you got the corner of my desk here.  Yeah, the other side.  No, it's supposed to be our desk.  Right.  Our desk.  You know what it looks like?  It's my desk.  You ever go to work with your pop to his office, and he's working, and you set up a chair in  front of his desk, put your little highlights magazine up there, and your little Twinkies  so you can have lunch with Dad.  That's pretty much where I'm at here in this situation. 
[00:10:00]  And then you left stuff on the desk, and I'm like, no, I can't have this.  He piled my crap up on my little computer sliding table that has no room.  I'm like, this is my desk now.  What, man?  It's the first thing.  You're like, get all this stuff off my desk.  And then he tries to tell me, no, it's our desk.  No, it's your desk, and I'm intruding on it.  And the problem?  I want my desk.  You can't have my desk.  I want my own.  I don't care about your desk.  All right, good.  I want a little corner of the office to call my own, hang up my own form of pornography. 
[00:10:30]  Sure.  It's funny, because we all have our own pornography.  Everyone's got their own smut.  Everyone's got their own smut that they want, hung up by their areas.  But I don't know.  I'm thinking somewhere in the corner, maybe by the window, I would like a little desk.  I have my computer thing, which is fine.  But there may be something.  I'm not talking about the Oval Office President Clinton Opie desk.  And you understand, though.  What?  For you and I, I'm wheeling and dealing. 
[00:11:00]  I need the big desk.  The big desk.  I sit there.  I put my feet on the table.  I'm calling.  No one can see that over the phone.  I'm calling Boston and Washington for us.  Are you telling them?  I'm wheeling and dealing.  Are you on the phone?  How are you doing?  Yeah.  No.  Right now, I got my feet up on the huge President Clinton desk.  It's great.  This is just like the one he got a Hummer on.  It looks good.  It's the biggest desk ever.  I don't know how they moved it.  And we all know I get in a little earlier than you.  Yeah.  And I'm trying to wheel and deal. 
[00:11:30]  Most of the time.  Wheel and deal.  For us, right?  Right.  So I need to look important.  Behind the big desk.  I'm not saying I am important, but it's good to look like you are important.  Well, you know something?  To have a little corner of the desk to put my stuff on so that you could yell and tell  people to move it.  It makes me feel a little inadequate.  Well, and I was a little embarrassed because I don't really need your NSYNC CD on my desk.  Look, I'm going to work with Daddy. 
[00:12:00]  Look.  What the hell is an NSYNC CD doing on my desk?  Somebody was being real funny.  That's all I'm saying.  I know.  Somebody thinks it's real funny to send me NSYNC CDs.  Well, let's not forget the DJ Jazzy Jeff.  DJ Jazzy Jeff's greatest hits also.  Thank you.  And I'm sitting there wheeling and dealing.  And, you know, salespeople are coming in.  They can't see that stuff.  We're supposed to have this cool image.  So I said, get it all on his side. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  Well, I need something of my own desk.  I don't need something.  I don't need the frigging aircraft carrier that is Opie's desk.  You could land planes on the thing.  You know, people can bang broads on half the desk and I wouldn't even notice.  It's that big.  No, you need like an L-shaped.  An L-shaped desk.  L-shaped computer thing.  You got your computer in front and then the other part of the L around to your left side  would be perfect for you.  Still where I'm sitting?  Yeah.  No, because it's in front of your desk still. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, you need to, like, take over.  I need my own area.  Okay, I see that.  I can't be in front of your desk looking like the kid that's going to work with his father.  I'll tell you, I know where you're going to end up.  Where?  You're going to have to take over his area.  No, no, Ben Fikes' area.  I got no problem with where Ben is.  I don't want to be there.  I will go by the window.  Keep.  What do you mean?  That's where I am.  I don't know.  Kind of by, um.  You're going to have to take over Ben's area.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  He's going to be a little pissed.  I will not do that.  No, I will not do that. 
[00:13:30]  I wouldn't do that.  Well, my desk takes up most of the window space.  Maybe I could saw my desk in head.  The desk takes up.  You know something?  Oh, but you certainly do not need a desk that big.  You people don't even understand.  We've got to get a picture of this thing and put it on the website.  It is retarded big.  The CEOs of IBM don't have desks this big.  I'm going to get one of those big, huge, leather, comfy chairs.  Get the big, comfy chair.  Wear the top of the chair behind you, still a foot higher than your head. 
[00:14:00]  A blotter.  Right.  You can, like, get office equipment with, like, golf things on it.  I'm going to get the Ted.  Get your nameplate.  I'm going to get the Ted Knight lamp from Caddyshack.  Sit down, Daddy.  Your desk is ridiculously big.  It doesn't have to be that big.  I don't know why.  It's taking up so much room in that office.  You know what I'm thinking?  We should get little high school desks like that in school where you sit in there  and it's connected, the seat and the desk.  That would make more sense knowing us.  You know?  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Whoever sits in this desk before me is an ass.  Whoever sits in this desk in third period's mother is a whore.  And I got the solution to the problem.  What?  We're going to have to expand already.  Already we don't have enough room.  We don't have enough room.  The largest office in Manhattan.  We don't have enough room.  If we blow out that wall, you could have your own space.  You ever watch movies where there's the big high-powered executive in Manhattan  and they go into their office, they go into their office, 
[00:15:00]  and it's the hugest office ever?  Yeah.  That's our office.  Yeah.  And we still don't have enough room because it's Opie's desk.  You're on a power trip with that desk.  No, I'm not.  It used to be Scotso's desk, and he needed that room  because he's like banging Yoko Ono on it or something on the weekends.  I don't know what he was doing on that.  But he had like this huge desk, and then it was our desk, and it worked.  It was never our desk.  It was your desk that I got the privilege of having a God-effing corner on it.  Even in the old office? 
[00:15:30]  Even in the old office.  How the old office was set up, it kind of looked like it was both our desks.  Okay, who had the side where the chair slides under?  Me.  Oh, okay.  I have the side where it's like, oh, my chair doesn't slide under.  Oh, where your knees hit?  Right.  Oh, I never knew that.  No, it only because it's one-sided desk.  I had no clue.  It's not a table.  Well, it's a desk.  They're already using my desk as the lunch table, too.  I'm not happy about that.  Well, they moved the lunch table into the lobby. 
[00:16:00]  Who designed this place?  The lunch table.  A lot of our listeners come by to say hi.  Make sure you take a look at the lunch table next time you're here.  Yeah.  It's at the bottom of the stairs in the lobby.  And you know what the funniest part is?  I mean, we used to come in, and the lunch table was in the middle section  between the two offices that we occupy now, and our old one.  So we would walk past the lunch table every day.  The language that comes off of this lunch table from Psycho Mark alone, and then you throw in a few other characters and forget about it.  Psycho Mark, the C word is every other word in his vocabulary when he's not on the radio. 
[00:16:30]  While he's eating lunch, right.  While he's eating lunch.  Ah, F and C.  F and C.  Ah, bang that F and C.  It's just, like, loud as hell.  Now, the table is positioned at the bottom of the staircase that leads up to Wins.  So people that are waiting to get into Wins, whoever it might be, maybe a politician come down for an interview.  Maybe a lady's auxiliary.  Who the hell knows?  They're waiting in the Wins waiting room.  Yeah.  Here's Psycho Mark chewing on his sandwich, yelling F and C, F and C. 
[00:17:00]  It's a freaking comedy show, this place.  All right.  Well, I guess we've got to expand.  We need more room already.  Now we need more room already.  Yeah, I think so.  I'm going to have to look at this office and see if I can fit a little cubby hole in around Opie's desk.  Your desk. 
[00:17:30]  That's funny.  But I don't have a computer, though.  Yeah, you do.  I don't have one.  Oh, you're getting one?  Where's that going?  Where's this computer going?  I don't know.  On your desk.  Probably.  Actually, that wasn't even the plan.  See, I don't want everyone to think that I got what I wanted here.  I lost my computer in the move.  How did you lose?  I gained the big desk as mine, officially, but I lost my computer.  Which is Rick's now?  Rick stole my computer.  So I don't even have a computer.  So I'm using his because he's gone this week. 
[00:18:00]  Then my private phone is ringing, and I have to run a sprint across this office to answer my phone.  The huge office.  Right.  I have my computer from home.  I didn't even get a computer.  You know, I really don't raid around here.  I wasn't even able to get my own computer.  I had to bring my old piece of crap Packard Bell from home.  And there's like car battery jumper cables that Scott Colombo hooked up, so it works.  All right.  In all fairness, I got to play devil's advocate here, though.  Okay.  When was the last time you used a computer during work hours for work? 
[00:18:30]  For work?  Yeah.  Well, let me think.  You know, the games often make their way on the air, Opie.  Just asking, because I think management's going to ask that question.  They're going to say, Anthony, do you really need your own computer that the company's going to have to pay for?  Well, Opie, and I would answer that as I believe our show prep is just living our lives and commenting on it on the air.  And if living our lives, in my case, is playing video games and trading online, then, yes, I do need a computer. 
[00:19:00]  Allison thinks that we're turning on each other.  Wait, I got to get her on the line.  Allison, what's up?  I have to love it, man.  First it's open ant against the world, and now you're turning on each other.  Oh, my God.  Get back to shaving some answers, will you?  All right, Allison.  Thank you.  All right.  We're turning on each other, huh?  Yeah, we have, it's a power trip now.  Look at this.  It's just like Martin and Lewis.  We're both going for control of the radio show. 
[00:19:30]  Secretly.  You can have it.  I know, really.  All right, we got to take a break.  Thank you for calling Career Match.  Please state your qualifications after the tone, and our computer database will provide you with an appropriate career choice.  Well, I can, I play pinball.  I'm up to level 46 in EverQuest, if that's one of my resume stuffer.  And I can drink beer and throw things at people. 
[00:20:00]  I could review video games.  Thank you.  Just a moment while our database computes your career path.  Our computer shows that your career choice should be douchebag talk show host.  Thank you for calling Career Match.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027-WNAW.  Ah, sorry about that.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We go along with the radio part. 
[00:20:30]  We got to go along with the commercial part.  Right.  Happens from time to time.  We get through it.  We work our way through it.  Sure.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Mike Tyson in the news again.  Oh, God, this guy.  Big fight coming up, as we all know, by now. 
[00:21:00]  And what a scumbag Don King is.  No news there.  I mean, no big revelation on that one.  Oh, yeah.  He's in the paper today calling Tyson, what?  A poster boy for the KKK.  For the KKK.  I guess he feels that what Mike does in public hurts the black man.  Because it's kind of, you know, stereotypical behavior.  Things like that.  As opposed to Don King, who, you know, killed somebody. 
[00:21:30]  He should talk.  And he's living quite large off of all the money he made off of.  Yeah, the only reason he's saying these things now is because he's done using Mike Tyson.  Mike Tyson doesn't work for him anymore.  If I wasn't such a big faggot, I would punch him in the face.  But I've come out of the closet.  Tyson, you're a faggot now?  I don't think that's exactly what I said.  And I sure ain't going to say it in this forum.  But I think I'm more lenient towards the homos. 
[00:22:00]  I think I'm a little more accepting to the faggot.  I think they want to be called homosexuals.  Butt pirates.  I'm more accepting and open to the gay lifestyle.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm getting tired of women.  My high pitch screams hurt my ears.  So I figure a manly yell might not be as bad when I'm plowing them in the keister.  So you're going gay?  Well, no, all I said was, I'm not homophobic. 
[00:22:30]  So Anthony, who's doing the voice of Mike Tyson right now.  No, I'm not.  I'm just looking on.  Wants everyone to know that Mike Tyson is now going gay.  No, no, no, no.  I'll set the record straight here.  Pick up that megaphone of yours and tell everybody in Tyson's voice.  I don't see a megaphone.  Went.  I'll read the story.  Yeah, you're reading.  I'm just going to sit here next to Anthony.  So Mike, you're thinking of going gay?  I don't know. 
[00:23:00]  It's a lifestyle I might want to check out.  I think I handled it like the army.  Don't ask, don't tell.  Don't ask what I'm doing to your ass and don't tell the police.  Tyson hugs off accusation.  First, Mike Piazza says he's not gay.  Now, Mike Tyson professes that he wouldn't hate him if he was.  So you like Mike Piazza if he was gay?  He's got a cute butt.  I like his buns. 
[00:23:30]  I'm just talking like if I was a faggot.  But I'm not homophobic.  Homophobic.  R-O-L-A-I-D-S.  Homophobic.  I spell good.  It starts with an H, Mike.  H-O-L-A-I-D-S.  Homophobic.  All right.  To prove it, Tyson got out of his SUV and hugged a demonstrator here yesterday who shouted,  stop homophobia at him.  Tyson's in town to fight heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. 
[00:24:00]  They don't talk about how I got out of the SUV.  How'd you get out of the SUV, Mike?  Well, they open up the tailgate and pull the big cage out and then set me free in an area  that I won't disturb like the dumps.  It's called the Mike Tyson relocation program.  They put the collar on me and you should see them all scurry away when they open that door.  But yeah, I got out of my SUV.  I thought they hit you with the tranquilizer and just waited for it to wear off.  That's what they do first.  But then they put a tattoo on the inside of my lip. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  They attach a collar with a radio transmitter around my neck and they put a clip thing in  my ear and I'm all like drowsy and they measure how long I am and my hands.  And then they put me in there and relocate me so I don't eat the garbage out of the dump  and eat little children's.  Lennox Lewis' children's.  I will eat his children.  Children's.  It's like a lojack they put on me so they can find out where I am if people start dying 
[00:25:00]  and getting butt effed.  Look, they found a pattern.  Look at the pins on the map.  We have 50 people got butt over here in this area.  Some children got eaten over here.  And there's some ladies with their esophagus is hanging out their mouths.  Oh, Mike.  I do some damage.  Yes, you do.  We all know that.  Can I finish this little story there, Mike?  Do what the f*** you want. 
[00:25:30]  It's about you, though.  Okay.  When Tyson pulled up to a fitness center, he was greeted by gay rights activists angry  at his use of gay slurs.  You've used a lot of gay slurs in the past there, Mike.  Don't use gay.  That's a bad word to use for them.  How do you spell bad?  Bad?  P-R-Q.  That's so stupid.  I did not even use a vowel.  Okay, I'll try again.  R-L-C.  R-L-C? 
[00:26:00]  That's L is a vowel.  That's the sometimes vowel.  No?  What do I know?  Finish the f***ing story.  Okay.  Here's the gay activist talking now.  I was shouting stop homophobia and holding up my sign,  and then he just came up and hugged me and said he wasn't homophobic.  Like said, Jim Maynard, vice chairman of Equality Tennessee.  I was totally shocked.  I didn't know he was saying that.  I couldn't understand him with my c*** in his mouth. 
[00:26:30]  Mouth.  M-O-F.  Oh, that was good.  I got that one.  Oh, you were close.  I love the fags.  They put up a tad more fight than the bitches do.  They could take a punch better than Robin Givens.  And I hit her harder than, oh, man, I punched her f***ing face in.  It was beautiful.  That was the best punch I ever threw.  F-R-E-U.  No, it's not.  I'm getting better at this.  No, you're not.  Homos like to be punching the testicles. 
[00:27:00]  They enjoy it like my tiger.  You're using slurs again, Mike.  Oh, I don't want to use the gun because I'm not homophobic.  Right, you're not.  I was inoculated against that.  How did I even get inoculated out?  Stop it.  That's ridiculous.  How do you spell it, Doc?  Eh, oh, don't make Mike's head explode.  It's very thick.  And what does that mean?  Oh, it's like a shot they give you to keep from being something.  And I didn't want to be homophobic.  I am a member of the gay community. 
[00:27:30]  Where do they give you that shot?  In the keister?  They give it to you in the can, and I give it to everybody else by proxy.  Proxy.  I give it to every, oh, sorry.  I give it to everybody else by epoxy.  Epoxy.  Comes in a pump dispenser, and you better pump it, you f***ing faggot.  Hey, that's another slur.  Calm down over there.  They know I love them, the homos.  You know what I, you know what's embarrassing about gay love, though?  Because, you know, I've been involved now with the homo community. 
[00:28:00]  You ever, you know, you do it the gay way?  You know what I'm talking about?  And when you take out your mule.  What's the gay way?  You know, the back way.  And then you pull your mule out, and there's something left on it.  You're like a pancreas.  You thought I was going to say.  Right?  Yes, I did.  See, pancreas, they're funny.  And that's a funny organ. 
[00:28:30]  All right, my favorite song.  I like bending over the gay men during this little tune, and f***ing them hard.  Pankreas, PMA, I forget it.  You can dance, you can dance.  F***ing them in the behind.  Oh, you see that fan. 
[00:29:00]  F***ing them in the behind.  F***ing them in the behind.  F***ing them in the behind.  Mike liked this song.  I'm going to see Mamma Mia on Broadway.  F***ing them in the behind.  F***ing them in the behind.  It's so fun.  Stitching right in between their phones.  F***ing them in the behind.  F***ing them in the behind.  F***ing them in the behind. 
[00:29:30]  It's him, Abba.  all right i liked the fernando that was a good song  which one's this oh i love this one look at me dance with my big paws in the air  i mean hands  i'm man hallelujah 
[00:30:00]  the gay community since i come out of the closet and figure i'm gonna be a lot of men  they have dubbed me even more harmful to them than aids well because i'm so big  all right that one didn't work  i'm almost checking out mike's body 
[00:30:30]  my body  gonna f*** you with my body  gonna f*** you with my body  every man wants to be like mike tyson f***ing everybody  all right i'm for this song all right i'm tired of the gay songs  but yeah i i accept the homos now  can i finish here  i'll finish on you  no that's okay 
[00:31:00]  we're here we're clear  i'll f*** you and bite your ear  i didn't find nothing that rhymed with that too quickly  i understand  the befuddled activist activist added  befuddled  do you know what befuddled means  it means you're a sucker  because he's a f***ing faggot  that's another slur mike  but i'm being nice i told him i hugged him  you don't do the slurs anymore  i hugged him and i whispered sweet nothings in his ear  i said 
[00:31:30]  i'm gonna f*** you till you love me  can i finish  this activist didn't know what to do when you hugged him mike  of course he didn't  he felt my member and thought it was the guy that was standing next to me  it was so big and then he looked and no one's there  you go who is that  i said it's my  i swear to god  it's like a piston off a p-51 mustang  big fat and long 
[00:32:00]  i make him move just as fast too  the p-51 mustang was an escort fighter for the bombers in world war ii  really turning the war around for our air battle  over berlin  letting the bombers have more air cover  while leaving england  for longer periods of time  decimating the german luftwaffe  i don't know i watched the discovery channel and 
[00:32:30]  okay  thus changing the course of the war  war  aww  see why do all my words start with aww  it's called a crutch  i f***ing suck  so more from the activist  so i just posed with him and smiled for the cameras  it's a step in the right direction he says  as he drove off later he rolled down the window and explained  i told them i'm not homophobic 
[00:33:00]  so if i use a homophobic term i'm not homophobic  isn't that a coincidence because i'm also not a homo sapien  i'm somewhere down the chart  between the little  you know you ever see the chart with the little hairy monkey guy  and he's got the long arms  yeah  and then there's the guy who's like walking with a briefcase  and in between somewhere i say about  two-thirds the way up the chart  and mike tyson  i'm the missing link 
[00:33:30]  that's attractive to the gay community  get your balls out  slap your ass off  grab your sport arm it's today  though it may not be anyone's birthday  and it's not near the 4th of july  i love all your gay guests on this program  i love mario canton  i love gay marco  i love jay moore  well jay's not gay  boy you know  that's the unseen episode of more sports 
[00:34:00]  it was how much more of mike tyson could jay take up his  and let me tell you it was everything  you thought his face is red before  you should have seen it now  well it's good to say you're more open-minded mike  yeah i figure you gotta be in this day and age  yeah  you know  just because i look like this  i don't live in the stone age  i understand that  you know  it's the 20th century 
[00:34:30]  21st century  21st  well i wasn't  i wasn't going to correct you there mike  don't correct me  no  all right  you can bend over and i'll  but don't correct me  it's okay  i'll give you the donkey punch  imagine looking around  giving a fish eye  and seeing my big smiling face  you know what i look like  if i'm plowing your  and you turn around and look at me  remember when king kong smiles at fey ray through the window 
[00:35:00]  remember that look  yes we do  that's the look you see before you black out from blood loss  there ain't no need for people's intestines to be straightened out for that amount of space  see because they wind around in your lower abdomen  yeah  and they ain't supposed to be straight for a good foot or two  not like that  i like a nice sphincter muscle  oh okay yeah so i'm accepting the gaze 
[00:35:30]  well yeah  and you can find that out on my 900 number  mike tyson's gay men's sex line  hi this is mike tyson  you've reached the hottest man's sex line ever  do you like big  short in your  i bet you do  you a hot gay mike tyson sex  well you could try it without mike tyson  i'll give you the mike tyson 
[00:36:00]  sex simulator  lay on the ground in front of a construction site on your belly  pulls your pants down  wait for the roofer to drop a roll of tar paper  if it hits correctly and goes in your  that's exactly what sex with mike tyson would be like  oh only if a big  thing of cement falls on top of it too  i could push hard  most girls complain about a little pain in that area after 
[00:36:30]  after the sex with me  not me  the girls complain about sinus trouble  that's how far up that mother goes  i swear to you  and when i  when i shoot  you know what it look like  you ever see that play-doh fun factor  where you push the top and it squeezes out the little guy's ears and nose 
[00:37:00]  that's always fun with the play-doh  you ever play that  you put it in  you push his head down and it comes out the ears and nose  i saw a chick do that once  and i said don't go to the cops  i almost popped the bitch's head right off  it flew right off  it was the funniest thing  so i'm into the game man  all right  i'm into the gay community  you know what was funny  it reminded me of a romantic movie i saw  i figured i laid that on my back 
[00:37:30]  and let the guy get on top  you know what i'm talking about right  and run it that way  yeah  and then it reminded me of the movie alien  because my member burst right out of his chest  come on  he couldn't take it  you pussy  thank you mike  so i'm very much more accepting  a little more uh open-minded  good luck with the big fight  i suffocated the girl  giving her the roman war helmet once  my yam bag  it's like a plastic bag over a child's head  she couldn't breathe

[00:39:00]  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A little Jimmy Norton in the studio today.  Of course.  Like always.  Paul Mercurio outside the studio with a film crew, Anthony.  Yeah, what's he filming?  I don't know.  We'll get into it in a minute here. 
[00:39:30]  He's entering the studio now.  Hello, gentlemen.  Camera's going.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm fizzy.  Oh, look at him.  He's ready to get that camera out of my face.  I asked him.  He said it was okay.  Oh, okay.  He's standing on top of me.  This is fine.  Jesus.  Oh, nice to see you guys.  What is this for?  This is for BeThere.tv.  BeThere.tv.  On the, what is something called the web, the internet?  Oh, that thing. 
[00:40:00]  I hate this already.  That's a fad.  That's a fad, the internet.  That's a fad.  Right?  Yes.  It's like the hula hoop.  And no one else is around in the city, so they needed someone to follow around, so they  called me up and they followed me around.  So they're following you around.  Yes.  During your day's events.  Day's events leading up to the Opie and Anthony appearance.  I don't know.  Why did I agree to this?  I should have worn my Voyeur bus t-shirt.  I know.  With your catchphrase.  Oh, come on.  With your catchphrase t-shirt. 
[00:40:30]  Thanks.  It's all on your face.  All right.  Okay.  Although I have one.  I like it.  I deserve it.  Yeah, well, Paul is wearing his Kathleen Butcher Goddamn clothes back on t-shirt.  All right.  It's queer.  All right.  All right.  And he's creaking out of his Kathleen Butcher Goddamn clothes on coffee mug.  Hey, Mr. Assistant Living Socks and Sandals, shut up.  Shouldn't you be watching your stories right now?  Your stories.  Oh, I didn't know that.  What are you doing with white socks and sandals and that Chelsea haircut? 
[00:41:00]  Are you auditioning for Cabaret?  What time is your audition for Cabaret?  You're going to totally...  Wow.  Oh, my God.  He's attacking today.  He's really making fun of you.  No, I can't...  He's really making fun of you.  I came to work today with my inline skates, and then I just threw my sandals on, and then  there are Tevas, and there's...  Yeah, I got white socks.  Who cares?  No one's looking at me.  They're not filming me.  Now they're looking at me and they're filming me.  Hey, Opie, put your goddamn socks on. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, man.  I don't feel so bad now for having comic on my license plate.  So this will be seen on...  When?  When can we watch this?  When can we watch it?  Alex, tell them when we can watch it.  You can watch this next week.  Next week.  Wednesday.  You just need a fast connection, right?  Next week.  Next week.  And, uh...  You should have all your white socks cleaned and dried by then, shouldn't you? 
[00:42:00]  And what website?  What's wrong with my white socks?  You're not with sandals.  I mean, who cares, though?  No one's seen me today.  You look like you should be picking fruit and then going home and taking a nap.  But I haven't even left the building today.  No one will ever see these.  You didn't...  Until you're pulling it out.  Oh, Norton was talking about it earlier.  I noticed them immediately.  That's the first thing I noticed with your legs crossed in those awful white socks and sandals.  Wait a minute.  My legs weren't crossed.  Yes, they were.  Are they gold toe socks?  And second of all, like, we're just hanging out.  Who cares?  Listen.  Listen.  Why do you care how I drink?  I don't. 
[00:42:30]  You just look like a European AIDS patient.  It bothers me.  You do.  Fredo, pull over.  I want to get some fruit.  Shouldn't you be holding me up on the highway going 40 with your directional on?  Oh.  Yeah.  What?  Oh, man.  It's not that bad.  Listen.  Sunburst guy here.  I can't get it out.  Oh, Jesus.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I was sunburnt like a month ago.  I know.  I know.  Now he's going to take into it.  I was sunburnt a month ago, and I didn't say one bad thing about it.  I didn't think about you, Paul. 
[00:43:00]  You really didn't?  You just let it sit.  I'm the nice guy.  Is this the new Paul Mercurio?  No.  Yeah.  Why are you attacking?  Yeah.  I don't like it.  Because I don't see you.  Austin, Patrice aren't here.  You can be nice.  No one's going to read you the riot act.  I think Norton's pissed at me.  Not at all.  Well, you're ripping off Ozzy.  A camera following you around throughout your daily events.  And so Jim gets pissed that, you know.  You make a valid point. 
[00:43:30]  I didn't realize that.  Thank you.  I was just going to sit here and take it.  Rich has a comment.  Go ahead, Rich.  I'm curious.  Homo Opie with your sandal socks there?  Yeah.  How bad is it in comparison to Norton's Spider-Man t-shirt?  The Spider-Man t-shirt beats my stupid Tevas with white socks on.  Yeah, you're right.  I won't deny that.  But I pointed out that it was wrong.  You walked the streets of Manhattan in that t-shirt.  No one.  I've also picked up a prostitute that turned out to be a man.  I've done a lot of stupid things.  Oh, my God.  I did that, too. 
[00:44:00]  That doesn't excuse white socks and sandals.  I did that, too.  Who cares?  No one's going to see me, though.  Wow.  Why would you wear that t-shirt?  Are you that into the movie?  Oh, you're showing the picture?  Yeah, look at the picture.  That's great.  No, the answer to that has to be yes, I'm that into the movie.  No, but that's not the intern.  That's not the intern.  One of the interns.  Oh, my God.  Looks like a homeless pregnant woman.  Tim, the intern gave me...  Oh, that's what you are.  I never saw it yet.  She gave me this shirt, so I just wore it.  I knew it was a bad choice.  And I was wrapping it up. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, and I'm getting crap for wearing a Kathleen Turner shirt.  It's different, though, man, because I realized it was awful.  And I acknowledged it before anybody else did.  I know it's awful, too, but I mean...  I acknowledged it, and I wasn't being followed by two pedophiles with a camera.  Oh, jeez.  Those are some strong accusations.  Please, let's hope.  Can you back that up?  What does Rich Voss want?  Hey, Richie.  Hey, Voss.  You going to help me out today?  Why?  What's the problem?  Hey, Paul.  Yes?  When you were working bananas, did Kathleen stand up in the back and say, be more funny? 
[00:45:00]  Oh, jeez.  Is that what I heard happen?  She was late for my show, because she walked out on yours.  Oh, yeah, please.  If you pulled out Paul's bottom lip, you could see pounds per pressure you're supposed to put in there.  It has your marking.  I like that.  How many people wrote that for you?  Oh, please.  What horrible campsite are you plugging this weekend?  You stink.  Let's bring them in at quarter to seven right before the vacation. 
[00:45:30]  What the hell?  We'll throw them a bone.  Right?  With his dumb shirt.  Oh, my God.  At least I'm not talking from a toll booth on my day job.  Oh, that was really bad.  You are really bad.  You are the friendship of comedy.  Where are you calling from?  Voss, where are you calling from?  I'm my youngest daughter's basketball game.  She starts her night league.  Oh, okay.  So I'm at the game.  Oh, you're not dodging her?  No, that's the youngest one.  Way to interact with her on a real meaningful level by calling into a radio show during the game. 
[00:46:00]  What's that?  That's a very strong accusation, Paul made.  I know.  That's true, Paul.  That's true.  But maybe we'll bring her to a game in front of 6,000 drunken people at a stadium.  Maybe we could do that.  We'll also bring my wife so she could see me not play.  That was a good point, too, Paul.  That really was.  I mean, I don't want to hear this.  I can't believe that you...  Norton's the guy who's Jewish but pretends he's German.  He plays at both ends from the middle.  At the softball, you would have saw that Paul's wife snuck off with Lynch because he was starting and he's a guitarist. 
[00:46:30]  Wow, you are on.  You must be taking Gotham writing courses.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, please.  Paul, I heard a rumor about you.  Hey, Paul, is that rumor I heard about you?  Should I bring it up on the air?  Is that true?  Or should we let it slide?  What is it?  I heard something really bad about your job, and I don't want to bring it up if it's not true or if you can't defend yourself.  Oh, no, there's nothing bad about my job.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You didn't get fired?  No.  You didn't hear the rumor that's going around? 
[00:47:00]  Oh, no.  No, I didn't get fired.  Oh, okay.  You didn't get fired?  No.  Oh, okay, because there was a rumor that you were breaking into other people's notebooks and taking their material.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Is that true?  That's a long journey there, Rich.  Wow.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's why I said I didn't want to bring it up.  That's what they were saying, and I was sticking up for Paul.  Shut up.  Way to stop a good-natured ribbing.  Hey, I hear your wife's a whore.  Let's kill all the kidding.  Hey, I hear you.  That's nice.  Is it true you killed three people and buried them in the field down in New Jersey? 
[00:47:30]  No, I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, okay, okay.  But you're kind of stuttering.  Oh, boy, this really is a good conversation with Jeff Holt.  I was on fire until I brought up the true story.  Yeah, there's no reason to get mean.  Everybody's having a good time, elbowing each other, laughing.  I'm not getting mean.  Hold on, boss.  Someone wants to talk to you here.  Oh, here we go.  We'll get out of this.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's up, boss?  You big, no juicy, fucking comedy, Chernobyl faggot.  How dare you talk to anybody about being bad? 
[00:48:00]  A new funny original joke is coming to me, but I'm dodging it.  You douchebag.  The first comic to make an entire comedy club was that they had an ear cancer.  You fat dick, look at you.  You think you're helping your kids?  They interview your kids and they ask them what they wanted for Christmas?  They said a father who's not a zero.  You dick, I'm fucking out.  And he knows when to leave.  Look at him.  He left on top.  That was the Vita. 
[00:48:30]  Lisa Lampinelli, check it in.  That was the Vita.  Whoever that was was on phone.  I couldn't understand the word he was saying.  It wasn't complimentary.  So, Paul, you're wearing the shirt I gave you?  Yes, I am.  And I'm getting a lot of stuff for it.  You gave me that shirt?  Yeah, but after I was done using it, you didn't clean the stains off it?  Yeah, there's white stuff on the back.  I know.  I figured I'd indirectly give it to him.  Hey, where's your first white guy on Def Jam shirt? 
[00:49:00]  Where's that?  I can't even believe you're talking.  We're not even talking about Black Sabbath right now.  You know what, stupid?  This is how dumb you are.  What?  The man who once told me, because I said the word permeate, that I had a good vocabulary.  You really are a third grade boob.  I was trashing the curio, not you, stupid, but you didn't get it.  It's got to be so obvious for us to get it.  I was touting one of your accomplishments and joking that you should wear it on a t-shirt  like this horse's ass. 
[00:49:30]  And, of course, you get defensive.  It's got to be an OzFest shirt and a Spider-Man shirt on the web.  I know it.  I don't deny it.  No, you can't avoid it by saying, oh, I admit to the stupidity of it.  It's still stupid.  It's ridiculous.  But I acknowledge it's stupid.  I can't admit it.  I admit I'm sucking a hog.  That's going to make me gay.  Exactly.  I know I've got a D in my mouth.  But this doesn't mean there's anything else to talk about it.  I don't think that's a very fair example.  To acknowledge an Ozzy shirt is different than acknowledging...  Why did you become Clarence Darrow all of a sudden?  I'd rather have a...  Who the hell is that? 
[00:50:00]  Who is Clarence Darrow?  He's a famed lawyer.  Why should I know that?  He invented the word permeate.  Come on.  We all brought it around.  Frank from Manhattan has a little jab at Voss.  Talk about going a long way for a bad joke.  Voss did the baton death march of setups for a bad joke about Paul being fired.  That was a long way there, Voss.  I know it was.  I heard a rumor.  I wanted to straighten it up because Paul's a friend of mine.  They didn't want any bad rumors going on.  I don't know there were any rumors going on.  Hey, dude, do you own a camera with a zoom lens? 
[00:50:30]  Because this guy walks right up to you with the camera.  Exactly.  I know.  The thing's right in your face.  There's a zoom on there, right?  You're going to take him to the whiz after this and get him a zoom.  There's not a zoom.  No?  A wide angle.  I don't think they want you to be in their face.  I don't care.  All right, Voss.  We're being reprimanded now.  Step back a little bit.  They don't like you black in their face unless there's a yambag hanging off.  Hey, Paul.  Yes.  That's perfect.  You got him.  How long did it take him to hang up?  I know.  Those little hands trying to reach up to the phone. 
[00:51:00]  It's on the desk, so he's like, he's trying to slam Duncan way up there.  He doesn't know, but he just dialed 911.  It's by accident.  He gets out the stepladder, hitting send instead of M because he can't read.  Hey, Paul.  Damn, where's the stepstool?  I need the stepstool to hang the phone up.  Let me get my younger daughter.  She's taller.  Goddamn Voss.  That's always nice when he checks in, right?  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  Well, you've left Comedy Central.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh.  I probably will be leaving at some point, but not right now.  Just like everybody and every job they have.  At some point.  He's dodging our question.  He is dodging something.  I'm going to be doing warm-up.  I'm not going to be writing on the show in the near future because I'm going to be doing  more stand-up.  There you go.  Oh, okay.  You got an Emmy.  Yeah.  Where else is there to go from there?  Six years.  Six years.  You got the Emmy.  Where else is there to go? 
[00:52:00]  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  I don't know.  He looks like he's getting dry or something.  No, not that everything's fine.  Is that right?  I am the luckiest man on the face of the...  Do you have Paul Mercurio disease?  Yeah.  It was called Lou Gehrig's disease.  Kathleen, lean, lean, lean.  Oh, my God.  Norton's turn.  I guess he suddenly turned on me.  I like you.  I have nothing to do with you personally. 
[00:52:30]  It's just that shirt has to go.  All right.  Okay.  I won't wear it again.  All right.  It was a bad...  I had a moment of bad judgment.  All right?  And I...  Oh, shut up.  Oh, shut up.  Not a knock on you as a man or as a performer.  It's just...  It's only as a shirt-wearing individual.  Yeah.  It had to be addressed.  So, if you're not writing for the show, you still have, like, tidbits when you come in.  I liked when you came in with that guy that was chased by the...  What was he chased by?  Snails?  Oh, yeah.  I have a guy today.  I have another one today.  Oh, you do? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll give it to you whenever you do.  What was the other story?  The guy that was chased by...  Six.  Ticks.  He had 150 ticks attack him.  He got attacked by ticks.  And the whole question is, how do you not run away from ticks?  Run away from the ticks.  Are you that pathetic in life that you can't just run from a...  I mean, you literally could sit there and knit a sweater before a tick can crack you down.  It's not like a cheetah.  Ah!  I got to turn this shirt and...  This shirt's...  What it is?  Yeah, who cares?  We all have, like, a little...  We all look...  I'm not...  Commercial break! 
[00:53:30]  Commercial break, what's the matter?  I can't get anybody to go...  Oh, God.  That is perfect.  I didn't even attack you with your shirt.  He did.  I did.  You're not defending me.  Well, because now we're all looking at the shirt.  We all have horrible shirts on today.  Yeah, whip them out Wednesdays and catchphrase.  We have horrible...  All I'm saying is, because he brought it up, now we're all looking at the shirt.  See, I'm not even looking at your eyes anymore.  All I see is Kathleen. 
[00:54:00]  Kathleen.  Kathleen.  The gym shirt is very colorful.  It's bright.  I'll say that.  It's got my idol on it.  It's an OzFest shirt.  It's a great Aussie shirt, right?  It's got Aussie's face on.  It's all green, like an underwater kind of green look.  Yeah, a little...  It doesn't look like Aussie at all.  It's very colorful.  It's a cool shirt, though.  I just love this shirt.  It is a very cool shirt.  I'll give you that.  We all kind of got lame shirts.  No one could really talk about their shirts today.  It's not a lame shirt.  No, it's not.  Well, we didn't know that a camera crew was coming in today.  Well, you certainly have your hair ready for it.  I would have worn the sand. 
[00:54:30]  All cut and tussled.  Exactly.  You want some rave?  Number three ultra holes?  That is the worst sports shirt I've ever seen, though.  No one's ever heard of the Cape Cod breakers.  That is such a Gap shirt.  I think it's an Abercrombie shirt.  That's like a team Michael Skakel used to play on.  Nobody knows who they are.  When you go to Abercrombie or the Gap, and they make it look like it's been worn a few times,  but it's brand new.  Like the lettering's worn off.  It's Cape Cod breakers.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I didn't know a camera crew was coming today. 
[00:55:00]  By the way, it's like 95, so make sure you wear your old man pith helmet with the fan in it on your way home.  We don't want you to get too hot, heat stroke, and pass out.  People with the white socks.  Make fun of the white socks.  Yeah, I know.  All right, I'll leave it alone, then.  All right, again.  Sorry.  No.  When did this become, this is like the Third Reich here.  Thank you.  I'm being edited.  What is this?  Anthony.  That's so big.  Again.  And they helped me out.  I like that.  Because I enjoy it.  It's just happened again.  That's all.  All right.  I'm enjoying it.  All right, something's coming at me. 
[00:55:30]  Norton's running around.  He's getting a pen.  This is good.  Yeah.  Hey, Paul, you got a story over there?  Shut up.  Shut up.  What did I do now?  All right, I got a story.  You want the story?  Yes.  All right.  Rick, maybe you could wear that.  For those of you that can't see, because it's a radio, it's a shirt that would say, this  is legal, isn't it?  This is legal, isn't it?  That was Rick's big quote before he got arrested.  See, now that would be stupid.  Everyone needs a catchphrase.  I'm sorry, Paul.  Oh. 
[00:56:00]  I like Paul's shirt.  Oh, you want to, can I say congratulations to a friend of mine?  Sure.  Joey Sanegate works up at the Boston Community Action, and he's getting married.  He's engaged.  Congratulations, Joey.  Very happy, Paul.  Didn't he listen to yesterday's show?  No, it happened.  It was a whole recap of my married life, and it was hell.  Yeah, but you're happy now with your lovely...  Well, yeah, but you know what it is?  When you're married, it sucks.  Wow, that's profane.  Everyone's getting really profane.  Everyone's getting pissed off at us. 
[00:56:30]  Go ahead, Rob.  Rob, Rob.  Yeah, will you literally stop nattering about your clothes and your marriages and say something  funny, damn it?  Did you just say nattering, you horse's ass?  Nattering?  Should we cut all the bunk?  I said that for you, Jimmy.  Thank you, Angel.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Paul, you got a little story there?  Yeah.  This is out of Bogota, Colombia.  You ready?  Hikers stranded in South America, and do you really want to hear this?  Did they find Pablo Escobar with a Medellín Cartel t-shirt on?  Shut up!  You know, I'm not going to try anymore. 
[00:57:00]  I'm not going to try.  Why do I try?  Now you're like, can I speak for the group?  Yeah.  It's a risky move.  And that doesn't mean you attack me for another ten minutes, because I'm just going to state  the obvious, okay?  I think you might have to change the shirt so we can get some comedy done.  Oh, God, he's doing it right now.  Turn your shirt inside out.  Oh, God.  Paul, turn your goddamn shirt inside out.  Oh, God. 
[00:57:30]  He's changing his shirt.  Look, I can see it in the video monitor.  He left the room to change.  And I can see it in the video monitor.  There we go.  Look.  There you go.  Now you just have a black t-shirt on.  No!  Is that good for you, too?  Put your goddamn C back in your pants.  Wow.  Was that what that was?  Well, I want you to see that Kathleen put your goddamn clothes back on, tattooed.  Hey, I don't like the fact that all one line.  What the F was that? 
[00:58:00]  And he has a small mule.  Oh, God.  The guy whipped it out.  Don't tell him it's small.  Mushnick will never write about that one.  That was horrific.  Did you see that?  Can we see that on the web?  Do you want to see it again in slow motion?  No, that's okay.  That's okay.  How's this?  It's like a porno site now.  I like the shot.  You take your white socks off now.  All right.  The story.  Let's...  I'm sorry I left you.  Bogota, Colombia.  All right.  You guys aren't going to give this any legit.  Come on.  We haven't done anything. 
[00:58:30]  Columbia Mountaineer slowly begins freezing to death, right?  He's surviving for 24 hours.  His only warmth coming from carefully measured doses of brandy.  And he reaches in for his backpack, for his cell phone, and his prepaid minutes are up.  So he's close to death.  And out of nowhere, a phone company solicitor is calling him on his cell phone asking if  he'd like to buy more time.  And we called him to remind him that his cell phone was out of minutes.  He said, it's the work of an angel because I was lost in the Andes.  And we thought it was a joke, but he insisted it was true.  So he called for...  The phone company called for help, and other operators kept ringing him to keep him awake 
[00:59:00]  and helping him with hypothermia.  I mean, that's unbelievable, and it's an actual story.  I mean, the guy is sitting there, and he's got no minutes left.  What?  I'm actually...  That is amazing.  And he...  And you know they charge him for the minutes that they called in to keep him alive.  If that was Sprint, some gorilla just would have hung up on him.  Can't help you.  Click.  See, that's an interesting little tidbit of information.  That was nice.  I like that.  We liked it.  You guys have set me up.  I'm not doing that.  We liked the story. 
[00:59:30]  You're not even helping out here.  Well, there isn't really anywhere to go.  It's just kind of a nice story.  No, we could be sitting there going up.  And Anthony and I left on vacation two days ago.  That's true, I know.  We're just watching.  That is interesting.  We're on autopilot here.  Interesting in the story that he got reception in the Andes.  I can't get it on 6th Avenue.  There you go.  There's the joke.  You know, in the mountains.  You know he was going, I'm stranded, I'm stranded.  And they're probably going, you don't have to be stranded anymore with 4,000 free weekend  in the night minutes.  Right.  The guy, you know.  All right.  I like that one. 
[01:00:00]  I can't win today.  That was good.  No jokes.  When did you turn on me like this?  What happened?  Why am I turning on him?  Don't hang me out to dry.  I'm not hanging you out to dry.  Who cares if you stab your buddy in the back?  What's the big deal?  And by the way, you'll be stabbing me in the back where my Kathleen Turner logo is.  Now, if he was on the mountain and ticks were chasing him, now, that story takes on 
[01:00:30]  a whole new level.  Great.  All right.  Guy's going to be walking around with a T-shirt.  I was out of minutes, but I'm alive now.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I had to get it.  What's wrong?  Everyone all right?  I didn't turn on you.  He did.  No, I know.  You know Jim did, right? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, yeah, I know.  Okay.  Just the shirt.  Doesn't it have to be a turn for someone to turn on somebody?  Well.  Hey, he's got another story.  You want another one?  Okay, yeah, please.  Help us out here, Paul.  Prisoner flees jail in a cardboard box.  You're not feeling confident about this one, are you?  You say to me, you got stuff?  I'm like, yeah, I got stuff.  Let's do it.  Okay, let's do it.  And now you're totally saying that.  All right, go back to the...  Speaking of prisoners, by the way, speaking of prisoners, they actually arrested Frank 
[01:01:30]  Morris a week ago because he was seen walking in San Francisco with an eye broke out  of Alcatraz T-shirt.  And then...  What a giveaway.  The guy should have known that that would tip him off.  Hey, why don't you put that in your bank of sound?  My Kathleen chant.  Put that in there.  We played it?  Yeah.  I don't have it in this.  Yeah, program it so you can hit the butt.  Come on, Anthony.  You're half of this.  I don't have it.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:02:00]  Good call back.  Rick, why didn't you just tell me I was coming on to be the guy who gets it today?  No!  Why didn't you just tell me?  I want to hear the prison one.  All right, I got it.  And I didn't...  We didn't say anything.  Yet.  We didn't say anything, eh?  Right?  Not a thing.  All right, let's go.  Here it is.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren!  I like that one.  Thank you very much.  See, we got your stuff in our machines.  All right, prisoner flees jail in a cardboard box.  This is Berlin.  German police have lost the man off for a convicted murderer who escaped from a cardboard box. 
[01:02:30]  He outwitted gods by concealing himself in a box that had been given to him.  He had been working in the prison.  Shut up!  He outwitted gods?  Zeus was looking for him and he outwitted him.  He did just say outwitted gods.  Did you catch that?  I did.  Let the guy read the stuff.  Are you feeling a little pressure today?  Yeah.  You sound like Opie on the Sam Adams read.  We're just sitting here listening. 
[01:03:00]  I just had the blue mic stuck in my hair.  That's how policy was.  I know.  Rick had the line of the day.  John Denchwistle has a shirt that says, I used to play in the Who, but now I'm dead.  Funny, man.  That is funny.  Hey, I want to talk to wheelchair Fred.  Oh, you're going to love Fred, Paul.  Paul?  Uh-oh, wait a minute.  Are you okay? 
[01:03:30]  I'm fine.  Oh, hold on.  What's wrong?  Do you need a beer?  Yeah, I need a beer.  I asked him for beer like a half hour ago.  Yeah, let's drink, man.  What's up, man?  I'm with you.  Why is he getting sad?  No, I'm not sad.  I'm fine.  Shut up.  I want to talk to Fred.  You dropped your head.  No, I was watching and listening.  I'm fine.  I have other stories.  I'm not reading them.  I have another thing that I came up with.  I'm not doing it because you guys, I've got a big target on my head.  Hey, where's Fred in the I'm not gay, I'm desperate sweatshirt?  I'm not gay, I'm desperate. 
[01:04:00]  There it is, his catchphrase.  Wow.  T-shirt's coming soon.  Yeah.  Let's do it!  Oh, she really does have one.  Yeah, she got one of our let's do it T-shirts.  Everyone should have a catchphrase T-shirt.  Yeah.  That's what I learned today.  Fred, what do you got?  Fred, what do you got?  Fred, what do you got?  Fred, what do you got?  Hey, I need a new shirt.  I need a new shirt.  You need a new shirt and an N.E.W. sticker? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Fred, hold on, man.  What am I listening to?  What am I listening to?  What is that?  What the hell is that?  Hey, that's what people were saying about 10 minutes ago.  Wow.  Fred is what?  What's up with him?  He's an ass.  An ass.  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, after hearing Mercurio tell that story, I don't know why he's not the host of The Daily  Show.  That was an unbelievable delivery.  It did kind of...  Yeah.  Could you try it again?  Yeah.  Which one? 
[01:05:00]  The, um...  The prison one.  I got this one.  I got a turtle one.  A turtle?  I like the nature stories, but the prison one.  German police have launched a manhunt for a convicted murderer who escaped from a cardboard  box.  The 27-year-old Yugoslava outwitted guards by concealing himself in a box he had been given...  He...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It happened again.  He had been given...  Shut up, Norton.  I didn't say a word.  Shut up.  I didn't say a word.  You might fold under questioning.  I might.  He had been working in the prison's box folding department. 
[01:05:30]  Don't ask me why they have a box folded.  It appears...  Shut up.  He...  It appears he got it into the box.  A truck driver unwittingly transported the box out of jail and the prisoner jumped off  the vehicle unseen, combing the area using helicopters, horses, dogs that were not able  to find the man.  The box is marked Fragile Murderer Inside.  Okay.  Was it really marked that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I've never seen him like this.  He's very angry today. 
[01:06:00]  Don't be angry.  What are you angry for?  He's supposed to get back.  It's the end of your run.  I come on with stuff.  I come...  I come...  I put it on the table.  He's asking a serious question, though.  I know.  Yeah.  Of course it didn't say Fragile Murderer Inside.  Because they would have caught him if it did.  I think so.  Or perhaps he might have been in the factory and as a joke, since he folded the boxes,  who knows?  Did they print them?  Maybe he, as a joke, printed that on so no one would really think there's a murderer  inside.  Absolutely.  But why didn't you set yourself up better? 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  Because it all just ran together.  I didn't know.  I would do the turtle now.  Maybe since he was in the...  I was going to do the turtle.  Like, when Jay Leno does that, then there's like the paw...  Oh, don't say that.  And then he gives you the stinger at the end.  And then you know it was the line that he wrote.  And you're like, who's that?  I don't know.  Who's the guy wearing the I'm the host of the Tonight Show shirt?  Skate, he outwitted God.  Oh, my God.  You know, they do a good job with that.  It sounds like a serious story, and then you know when the zinger comes out. 
[01:07:00]  The biggest mistake I made.  You just ran it all together there, Paul.  The biggest mistake I made was wearing this shirt.  Say, a fragile murderer inside.  Yeah.  You know?  And then everyone laughs.  And then you mimic it.  You do pantomime to really get the joke across.  Yeah, you got to move on to the...  Just let us know when the stinger's coming.  The stinger.  The stinger.  I don't know when the stinger is.  You know, that...  That...  That what Dino used to tell...  That, you know...  Frank.  What's it over the top?  Let me know when the stinger's coming. 
[01:07:30]  That's like old school.  I want to hear the turtle story.  I got the turtle story.  I got Jane Clayson.  Turtle.  I want to hear the turtle.  I want to hear the turtle.  You want to hear the turtle?  All right.  Swimmer's relieved this giant turtle is nabbed.  This is also in Berlin.  This is in the box.  Your stories are never from this country.  They can never be confirmed.  Right.  They're from some European nation.  You're like the Weekly World News.  You can't confirm anything.  Was there a Sasquatch spotted by this turtle? 
[01:08:00]  Wait for the dog face story.  And a shirt with a Bigfoot print on it.  I am Bigfoot.  The turtle was wearing a shirt that said,  I spotted Bigfoot.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Turtling me.  I'm good in soup shirts.  What's the matter, Opie?  Can't get anybody to go out and yell at Kathleen Turner.  I'll do it.  Oh, really?  Okay, that's great.  Dude, I'm not a turkey show.  So nice to me. 
[01:08:30]  So nice to me.  Wait, what was the jab I did?  No, the whole thing.  The whole vibe today.  Who came in here and gave me 10 minutes of crap?  Is it the whole vibe?  Yeah, the whole thing.  I threw two orange at him.  Even from you in your passive-aggressive corner  and your little passive-aggressive goatee over there.  No.  Wait a minute.  Paul, if you've noticed,  I always stay out of these things.  He really does.  I always stay out of them.  I apologize.  You attacked my sandals, my socks, my hair cut.  You went after me, and I gave you two jabs.  That's true.  You're the worst, Jim. 
[01:09:00]  I don't care about you guys being the ones that pay the salary  and him just being a guy I know.  Who cares?  That has nothing to do with it.  I pay your salary?  Well, you know.  What, are you insane?  Not technically, but you know, you say bye.  I'm done.  And Lord knows we're thinking about it.  I know.  I know.  Believe me.  I mean, the message works.  I want the old days back.  I'm dead.  All right, listen.  First of all, I'm not attacking Paul Mercurio.  I want that.  No, it's not an attack, per se. 
[01:09:30]  There's a very...  You gave me a ten-minute beating,  and I just punched back a couple times.  No, that's fine.  We just love each other.  We left two days ago.  We're not even here.  You're not even looking at us.  Rick Snickering.  Shut up, you Puerto Rican.  He put his fat ass in my camera shot, too.  It's hairy Puerto Rican chalupa ass.  And you're pulling out your junk.  Yeah, you did show your mule.  I mean, I'm not trying to say anything, but...  And now you're insulting Rick's ethnicity.  You are totally a Nazi sympathizer.  You are. 
[01:10:00]  At the core, you are the guy.  No, down the street, down the street.  You've done some amazing stuff for our show.  I'm getting no support today.  I want to hear the turtles cry.  You'll even be hanging out.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  You're ready to go with the turtle.  Swimmer's Relief.  This is Berlin.  Reuters.  Reuters.  And it's got to be real.  You're really thinking of firing me?  You're going to have a t-shirt.  I've been fired by O&A.  That's a boss move.  Really?  The boss is like nothing bothers him.  And Tim is like, really?  Do you think?  He'll have a t-shirt.  I stink and O&A don't like me. 
[01:10:30]  Will they carry him?  Oh, yeah.  He thinks I don't like him.  I should wear an expert.  All right, we're going to take a break.  What happened to the turtle?  That's a t-shirt.  We'll do the turtle.  Oh, God.  That is awesome.  That's a tease?  No.  Well, we wanted to...  I just want you to know this is going to be an awkward commercial break.  Oh, see?  See, you didn't even have to mention that.  We all knew that.  It's going to be awkward now.  Why'd you have to bring it up?  Now it's double awkward.  I was going to turn up the mics and go, hey, you're doing a good job for us today.  Give me one of these.  A little chin tap.  One of the like, hey, fella. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, see, that's where you jump in.  You say you don't jump in.  Passive aggressive.  No.  You just jumped in.  Let me tell you why.  To describe to the audience what the chin, the fist on the chin thing.  But you didn't say fist and chin.  You said fella.  Because yesterday we had mentioned that that's the hey, fella.  It's nothing against you.  You're being...  And this isn't about you.  Now, I'm thinking you're coming across as a little paranoid today.  Yeah.  This isn't a bash.  This isn't a...  You're coming across as a little paranoid.  No.  Right.  Rich Voss brought up a touchy situation.  I don't know what it is.  And since then, it's been a little weird. 
[01:11:30]  I think it's been a little weird.  Rick, you are uninvited up to Rhode Island, by the way.  You're not coming up.  What's in Rhode Island?  I didn't get invited.  What's in Rhode Island, man?  A Bigfoot convention.  There's a giant turtle and a giant...  And they're shipping that guy in a cardboard box.  He's coming.  They're all going to Berlin.  And I'm having a...  And I'm having a gross of T-shirts made up.  We're going to sit around.  A little party gift at the party.  Thank you.  Someone's finally laughing at what I'm saying today.  That's very funny.  Thank you for judging me. 
[01:12:00]  I didn't say...  Wait, did you become the...  Oh, my God.  That was a little judgmental.  That was.  Okay.  I'm trying to say nothing, boss, but it was a little loss.  It's an uncomfortable...  I'm just being uncomfortable, and I'm just trying to answer.  He just felt like he had an open situation.  I'm having a run.  He was helping out.  A cookout.  I'm having the Mountaineer guy with the cell phone.  And the guy, the murderer in the box, and the sea turtle are all coming to my house  up in Rhode Island.  There's a little beach house that my parents have.  We're going to hang out. 
[01:12:30]  And I was going to have Rick and his wife come up.  And before I came on there, I said, Rick, you should come up for a weekend.  And now that I've been totally sandbagged by this show...  But why didn't you invite us?  Oh, my God.  Because you wouldn't come.  You're so whatever.  You know, you're busy buying...  What?  I would...  We would go.  I've never been to Rhode Island.  I mean, I would love to go.  Yeah.  What's wrong, Paul?  Camera crew going to be there?  Put you right on that page.  All right.  We're going to break.  Steroids.  It's going to be very uncomfortable.  Why are you attacking him? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Why did I come in with this crew?  It's because you guys are here.  They're not going to let me have any legitimacy.  Voss, call back in.  It was actually better when you were on the phone.  Oh.  Racist empaths are not tolerated here.  And Rick being Puerto Rican has nothing to do with...  Just don't pull your mule out anymore.  I'll do it right now.  No, it's okay.  I actually wouldn't mind another look at that.  All right.  Here.  All right.  Well, I'm not looking.  You've got to look, though.  You've got to really look.  There.  Oh, my God.  He's stretching it like puppetry of the schlong. 
[01:13:30]  Picture...  Picture...  He just stretched it into a wind sail.  But that's...  It's like a baby mule with an elastic bag on it.  I'm going to zoom in on that with the white angle.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go in there.  It's clean.  It's clean.  I showered, and I put baby powder on it.  Oh, well, then.  Here, wait.  Let me handle the mic now, too.  Last time I saw a mule, I thought it had a diaper on it.  She's using props for laughs now. 
[01:14:00]  See, that's low.  That's low.  What are you doing?  I'm just hanging.  I told you.  I'm doing nothing.  At least I'm admitting it.  There's this thing that you guys created of, like...  You think you...  He really did just hit you there.  What did we do?  He really did just chat in.  I got you.  He really did.  You can't...  It's like...  You shouldn't come in here and attack.  I didn't attack.  You don't think we know how to play this game?  You came in and attacked.  The boss is saying that you kind of attacked.  I'm not kidding. 
[01:14:30]  I'm not trying to say anything.  It's not my business.  You don't want to get in the middle of this.  Hey, Joe from Philly has something.  Yes, Joe?  Yeah, hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Joe from Philly?  Yeah.  I wanted to ask Mercurio if you had an I Heart Rhode Island t-shirt.  I Heart Rhode Island.  Very good.  Very nice.  I am being attacked by four people at once. 
[01:15:00]  No, you're not.  I am.  I am so not attacking you.  Rick is writing notes to you.  I haven't read one thing Rick has written down because they're usually very inappropriate.  And I can't read.  Hey, we have an old friend.  Check it in from Boston.  Who's this?  Hey, it's Dustin Diamond.  Dustin Diamond, what's up?  I wanted to thank Mercurio for making my appearance look like the best in ONA history.  Hey, shut up, you dick.  Oh, my God.  Hey, I really didn't know he was going to say that.  You made fun.  You made for a little bit.  A little bit. 
[01:15:30]  You made fun.  This has been the worst hour of my life.  No.  You're just very paranoid today.  Yeah.  I'm your boss for the day.  I'm uncomfortable with this.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Stop it.  No.  Voss fights back.  Whoa.  Hello, America.  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs.  Wait.  Wait a minute.  That can't be right.

[01:17:30]  I'm not a company man, dude the fact that, shut up, take it, just take one, but I'm just trying to tell you, I don't, 50% of my possessions are being directly responsible by the,  Get it out, who cares, 50%?  That's coincidence, you have something in common with my ex-wife, you're such a sellout, Norton, 
[01:18:00]  You know what I want to know, he's calling you a sellout, I don't know why, you and I in the clubs together used to be a real down to earth guy,  Now it's like, you come in, I can't even talk to you in commercial break, you're on the phone, you're on the phone, you're on the phone, you're on the phone, you're on the phone, you're on the phone, hey Paul, you did ignore him, you do, you ignore me,  How do you look somebody in the eye after that raping, what was I going to say?  I had to tolerate Voss on the phone, Paul's not really mad at me, is he?  I swear to God, yeah, she did, what a nervous Nelly Voss is, get Voss back on the phone, 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, I had to make sure Paul wasn't mad, he's not mad, nope, he's not mad, he gets it, how is that going to affect my career?  Oh, you know that's what he thinks, like, somehow Paul might be able to help Voss, so he wants to be friends with everybody,  More empathetic than I thought if he thinks I can help him,  You'll badmouth him to John Stewart, who will hurt him with a studio exec, Voss really thinks that way,  That's a good idea, how do I do that again, let me write that down,  Hey, Voss,  Hey, Paul, you're opening for Dom?  What's up, Richard, hi,  Hey, Rich, Voss, 
[01:19:00]  How are you?  What's going on, so you're opening for Dom, who are you opening for next week, Bobby Collins?  You're doing the whole big tour.  Hey, you know, this is not a good way to mend fences.  Yeah, come on.  No, I did call to see Paul is upset with me, you know, I don't want Paul mad at me.  No, I'm not upset, I don't know, I'm still working at the Daily Show, I'm going to keep working there,  my contract is up June 30th, I have a new contract, I'm going to...  Paul, servicing John Stewart doesn't mean you're working there, are you still writing there?  That was, that was pretty good.  Dude, that's really, he's implied, he's got to go, that was pretty good.  That was pretty good. 
[01:19:30]  He's going to go and suck John Stewart, and that's going to be like your gig.  Dude, what kind of an implication is that?  What are you getting at?  Yeah.  Who, me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing, I was just wondering, you know...  You're usually not this mean, what's wrong with you?  He's just right out of the box today.  I'm not mean, I'm not mean.  No, usually not.  You guys have turned me into this pit bull.  Dude, you were a douchebag long before I met you 10 years ago.  That's true.  You've always been a douche.  I know.  You never make a good impression when you go, there's always a problem. 
[01:20:00]  I know.  The first gigs we did on the road, he made a waitress go in and look at my mule in the closet.  So you were in the closet waiting for her to come in.  She shut up.  I made a girl the other night at a bachelor party cry.  At a bachelor party.  Oh, oh, why?  Boss is telling a joke.  Everyone be quiet.  No, I'm not telling a joke.  Why would I tell that one of you?  You'll probably take it.  It kind of sounded like a boss set up.  Yeah.  So I think I'll wait.  Oh, boss is telling you to be quiet.  I don't come into the studio with little tidbits about other countries and little stuff prepared.  Because you can't read. 
[01:20:30]  That's why.  Stupid.  I'm an average genius.  You can't afford a computer.  You spend it all on tattoos and jewelry, you stupid Jew.  Stupid.  What can I write for the show tomorrow so I look good for my big Monday and Tuesday headline date?  Dude.  I grew up in your womb as barren.  What little tidbits can I write about some little political humor?  Dude, he did call your material tidbit.  That's a long one.  I don't want to cause any trouble.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  He exalted you a little bit. 
[01:21:00]  We're expecting a comeback here.  That was a little rough.  Yeah, tidbits.  Put your second job and get new teeth, you stink.  Ooh, I can't hear all this because I'm on my shelf.  You always say that.  What do you expect?  It was another tooth joke.  Yeah.  Oh, he did another tooth joke?  Don't say that in a demeaning way.  Oh, I haven't seen your joke.  That was something.  What was that?  It was another tooth joke.  Voss gets a lot of people telling me.  I don't want to tell him big jokes.  Where's your Peabody Award?  The boss doesn't need an award.  He's the glue that holds the show together.  Thank you, Jim. 
[01:21:30]  Paul is working Boston this weekend.  The Passaic Mall t-shirt on.  When are you going to start calling him handsome?  Hey, Paul.  He's so handsome.  He knows it and I know it.  There's no reason to say it.  Look at his chiseled chin.  His smile is like the sunrise.  Hey, hey, Paul.  Yes.  Paul's working Boston this weekend and his lips are working Rhode Island.  Oh, boy.  Another lip joke.  Wow.  I really wanted to...  Paul's freakishly large feminine lips have been talked about.  There's no reason to...  I'm not trying to say anything wrong about your lips.  And so is my teeth. 
[01:22:00]  What happened with the strippers at the bachelor party, boss?  I want to know now.  No, no.  A bunch of bachelorettes weren't shut up, so I tore into them and they left in the bachelorette,  left crying.  Where was it?  Danger fields?  No, at the stress...  I don't work there.  At the stress factory.  Last weekend.  Where a lot of O&A fans came and supported me.  Thank you.  Boss, that would be a weekend gig, right?  That was last...  Yeah, at the stress factory.  What are you implying?  No, I'm just...  I'm going to be at the stress factory.  We...  The weekend of July...  I was at the... 
[01:22:30]  That was very not cool to imply that he can only headline a Monday and Tuesday and he  needs to drive to the bathroom in the middle.  That was really rough.  Look who spells it out.  He's saying that he drives to Boston just to open for someone.  That's rough, man.  I was just trying to clue people in.  I am headlining...  That's one of my jobs with the show.  I am headlining at the stress factory July 11th through the 13th.  That's a Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  There you go.  Yeah, a lot of people wait on the shore.  Hey, here's Paul. 
[01:23:00]  Here's Paul at the stress factory.  Say stress factory again.  Try not to spit this time.  Seriously, because if you're driving, you're going to impede your vision.  Impede means get in the way.  All right.  Sorry.  And then you could have an accident, which means you'll hurt yourself.  Go ahead.  Take it what I'm giving, Rip.  Paul, why don't you practice...  Oh, boss is telling a joke, everyone.  I'm not telling a joke.  I'm just saying, why don't you practice and go, our next act, you might recognize him. 
[01:23:30]  Mr. Norris.  Say that.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Dude, he's implying that you're a perpetual host.  Hey, Stevie, you don't have to explain my jokes.  They get it.  All right.  Really?  Well, okay.  Where are you now?  Why aren't you interacting with your daughter at her game?  You really get sarcastic.  Why aren't you interacting with your daughter at her game?  I'm watching her at halftime right now.  But you should be talking to her, seeing how she feels about the game.  You should be talking to her.  You should be talking to her.  I'm a father.  I'm a father.  I have a three and a half.  You want to say something bad about my kid, too?  Go ahead. 
[01:24:00]  No, I would never.  I'd never talk about people's kids.  And don't tell me I had a parent.  You're opening for Di Myrera.  Shut up.  Okay?  I know I had a parent.  What does that mean?  What's that mean?  I think the boss is saying that what kind of kid would want to go, yeah, that's my dad,  the opening act.  I think that's what he's saying.  And I really don't like that implication.  Paul works hard, dude.  You should lay off him a little bit.  That's true.  Shut up, you lesbian.  You're right.  You're right.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Hey, listen.  I've got to go.  I'm going to have a lean cuisine right now.  I didn't know Daffy Duck likes lean cuisine.  No, boss is doing a callback. 
[01:24:30]  Boss is the dumbest matter.  We were talking about low-fat food.  And he wasn't kidding.  I like lean cuisine.  Lean cuisine.  And I'm like, what did you say?  And he's like, lean cuisine.  The crew sound.  The UI is not a key, you moron.  How did you get a degree?  Did you put a gun to a teacher's head and make them fill the form?  He doesn't have a degree.  Oh, he just hung up.  See, you got them all upset.  That's not good, Paul.  Now he'll be calling Norton.  Is everything okay with everybody? 
[01:25:00]  Are low-fat food-eating people mad at me?  Shut up, coward.  You might have went too far with that, Paul.  Dolt.  Let's hear one more story.  Yeah, I know.  One more.  And I have this whole other thing that I do.  I'm not going to even read.  I'm not going to even do that thing now.  A whole other thing?  Yeah, it's too good for you.  It's too thoughtful.  I want to hear it, though.  I want to hear it, dude.  Don't blame me because they...  I've always liked your stories.  Yeah.  Go for the thoughtful one.  Nah, it's too...  Please.  It's too high concept.  It's too meta.  Oh, too high concept. 
[01:25:30]  Please.  You're making fun of our intelligence, see?  I'll get it.  I'm smart.  No, I know Norton will get it.  Don't try to separate me from the boss.  If they get it, I get it.  If I get it, they get it.  We all get it, and we all don't.  Do you got it, then?  You know, we don't go for that divide-and-conquer stuff around here.  Never works.  Do you have it there, Paul?  Oh, boy.  I mean...  Wait.  Wait, are you going to cut me off?  No.  It's quarter two.  No.  Am I the guy that cuts anyone off?  I don't have the buttons.  What are you writing about me?  Just go, Paul. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  You want to leave with something thoughtful?  Let's hear the story.  This is a transcript from the Today Show.  Now, the Today Show is a news...  Why am I doing this?  Look at you.  You're not even looking at me.  You're sucking on a bottle of water like a camel.  You're not even paying attention to me.  I want to hear the story.  I want to hear it.  All right.  What's your problem?  This is a...  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener. 
[01:26:30]  I can't believe you're using that on me.  That breaks my heart.  I know.  Using what?  You broke my heart.  Did I use anything, Jim?  What?  Broke my heart.  Exactly.  I don't think you did.  Exactly.  Steve Martin's irresponsible.  I hope your athlete's foot crawls up to your face.  Ow.  Kills you.  Devours your skull.  Oh, my God.  Whoa. 
[01:27:00]  I'm getting a case of the vapors.  Yeah.  I want to hear the story.  I don't want any more other time.  When did I become your boy?  I don't want to play this role.  No.  Yeah.  Why are you looking at me?  You.  It's our show.  No, he's not.  He's fine.  No.  I'm fine.  You all say you are.  With that circumcised hog.  Yeah.  Meatly.  Back when men.  That's no lean.  That's no lean cuisine.  No.  Big juicy.  That's a real lesson teacher. 
[01:27:30]  That's a cholesterol builder.  I don't want to hear the story.  I don't want to hear the story.  All right.  Let's hear the story.  I'll do another story.  How about that?  Here we go.  You ready?  All right.  Ready.  Did I do the turtle yet?  I didn't do the turtle.  You did the turtle.  No.  Oh, you stopped.  Oh, God.  Yeah, okay.  This is Berlin.  Reuters.  In Berlin from Reuters.  The turtle.  Hello.  Hello.  Sitting on.  Hello.  Hello.  Germans banned from swimming in a lake in Munich after a giant turtle was seen there relaxing. 
[01:28:00]  The monster has been wrestled ashore and handed over to Munich's University Zoological Institute.  There's a snapping turtle.  It's named Dorney.  It's thought to have been brought in from a pet shop and later released in this lake where he lived for a decade.  He reached 32 inches.  People would not go swimming in a lake because of a turtle.  These are Germans.  Germans wouldn't swim because there was a 32-inch long turtle.  You don't want to help.  See?  Normally, you'd start to riff with me. 
[01:28:30]  Now, my mind was all of a sudden going like a...  Suck my...  Suck it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  No, it was going like...  Oh, wow.  I was just thinking of a German thing.  Hold on.  I all of a sudden was brought back to World War II.  I was trying to get the German angle going.  I'm trying.  And you normally jump in and riff.  I'm not.  Dude, I was listening to you.  And you leave me hanging out.  The second you finished the story, you started yelling at me that I wasn't helping.  But I'm halfway through. 
[01:29:00]  You did yell at the Anthony half of the O.B. and Anthony show and start giving him a bunch  of malarkey.  I'm halfway through and I can already sense that I am being totally undermined.  No.  I wasted my own stationery.  We're just waiting for a punchline.  Where's the punchline?  No, it was a story.  It was a story and he was just saying that he feels that everybody left him at you.  Oh.  You really should work for the U.N.  You'd be perfect there.  They get nothing done.  Oh.  So I was trying to.  We're sorry. 
[01:29:30]  I was trying to think of, you know, something.  Germans, turtles.  Yeah.  You know.  Like, it's funny.  Swimmers.  Put that turtle on their head.  That looked like a Nazi hat.  Right.  Like a Nazi helmet.  This is from another part of the world.  This is from the.  This is from the.  No.  No.  What?  No.  What?  No.  What?  We're going to go now.  Why?  We got to go?  I want to play.  What did you learn?  No.  No.  No.  We're done.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Tell them where I am.  No. 
[01:30:00]  Obi and Anthony show.  One or two seven.  W.  Any W.  Ben's a potty mouth in commercials.  But the funny thing is, you say the F word and look and see the mics are on and then stop  talking after the curse goes out.  Yeah.  Was there a curse there?  I don't think you heard it.  What did you say?  You had to take another effing jump?  I spilled my coffee during the commercial break all over the place. 
[01:30:30]  Coffee and pizza?  No wonder you exploded in the toilet.  You're right.  God almighty.  What's the matter?  Is there any X-lacks available?  Coffee and pizza.  We're back with the Obi and Anthony show debacle.  Using that term very loosely today.  I bet you Ben takes solid dumps.  I'm not trying to be weird, but I bet you they're like an inch long and three inches wide.  Like little rock'em sock'em robot heads.  There's a lot of cheese on that pizza, too. 
[01:31:00]  It's going to be a mess later.  Beed the sweat on his forehead.  Hey!  Is there a karate fight in that stall?  No.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Ben just wants to go home.  That's hilarious.  Ben!  You were the one that messed up this whole show and you don't even know it by having a party 
[01:31:30]  last night.  Trying to wipe cookie jerky movement paper all over the stall.  Look, Ben is not amused in the least.  Let's move on.  Hooker's door.  Hooker's door.  Hooker's door.  Bowel move on.  Oh, my God.  This is some sick...  Was that your stomach rumbling?  Not right.  That was the thunder outside. 
[01:32:00]  Oh.  Prime it up for another evacuation.  There was a cheese working its way through Ben.  Ben, I thought cheese didn't sit well with you.  I don't know.  He's so annoyed that we're talking about his bowel movements.  Why?  Dude, you're my favorite people.  I don't care if you take horrible, loud dumps.  He's percolating.  Yeah.  Hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day.  Old Chewbacca colon.  It's hilarious. 
[01:32:30]  Did he clean up the mess you made?  The coffee and the keyboard and the computer and stuff?  Pretty close.  Okay.  Hope you don't have to dump out.  Not you.  Ben, you should really be shot for having your party last night.  What should he be shot with?  Hopefully not Metamucil.  Did it stink up the bathroom, Ben? 
[01:33:00]  I was waiting for Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS there to come in.  Oh, that faggot with the beard who loves to run in there after you.  You know what?  I really hate to use that bathroom, too.  If anyone else comes in, I hate that.  I don't like using any bathrooms when people are in there if I got a crunch, man, because  it's a very private moment for me.  Yeah.  Very private moment.  And sometimes you get such a bad stomachache and you really got to go.  And I run to the back and he's got the door propped open.  The Richard Dreyfuss with AIDS guy that cleans the bathroom. 
[01:33:30]  And he's got the door propped open with his cleaning equipment cart blocking the door open.  And I come around that corner and go, oh, Jesus Christ, I'm just going to crap myself.  The weird thing is he cleans the bathroom for a really long time.  Long time.  And he has the breathe right strip over his nose so he can enjoy every odor.  He makes me sick.  Hey, Jacques Cousteau, clean it at midnight.  You don't have to clean it at 7 p.m.  He loves being in there when he knows show guys are taking dumps.  He really does.  And he acts like he doesn't know ink. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, he shuffles around, doesn't even put gloves on, just scrubs out the toilet.  Hey, if something winds up under my nails, well, I eat it on the way home.  Elbow in the ribs.  It makes me sick.  I don't even like taking a leak when he's doing that.  The door's propped open.  People are walking by.  You're just standing there.  The guy doesn't understand.  Close the door.  Clean your stuff at night and get out of there.  I took a leak next to Earl the other day and I looked right over.  I was just staring right at his mule.  Boy, Earl, are you a myth breaker. 
[01:34:30]  Earl looked like he might have five perfect conditions.  I was in the stall and I heard him yell, stop that.  And I didn't know what was going on.  Because I'm standing next to him and I am looking right over past his shirt.  I could just get a full view.  Very, very unimpressive.  Earl likes to talk, too, when you're in the bathroom.  He's one of the guys that you'll be in there and you'll be like...  A talker?  He likes to talk.  It's a little awkward.  My two buddies at Pergman, when I used to work there, 
[01:35:00]  this guy Malcolm, was taking a dump  and him and this other dude were passing a pound cake under the door.  I swear to God.  The guy's under the door and all of a sudden I see a pound cake come back up  and the guy outside takes it, takes a bite.  I think you're a guy taking a dump, a pound cake.  I never will.  My buddy Malcolm McGee, another guy.  I forget the other guy.  Awful.  One time my father took us to Nathan's.  You know, the hot dogs, famous for their hot dogs  and they serve fried chicken and stuff. 
[01:35:30]  So we went into the bathroom.  Because, you know, my dad took his two sons  and then we all had to take a leak.  So we go into the bathroom.  We pass by the stall.  One of the stalls didn't have a door.  And sitting on the ball was this old black guy  eating Nathan's fried chicken.  Just sucking on a wing right there on the ball.  I was like, ah, all right. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, God.  My stomach is hurting today.  Uh, man.  I guess who else's was.  All right.  And he's finished with that cheesy pizza.  Oh, pizza.  Bowl moving Ben.  Pizza and coffee.  What's that beverage fleet?  He's dripping sweat from his forehead already.  It's a day after a crazy party.  Right under, like, where Ben's hair meets that.  There's just sweat trickling down.  It's awful.  Oh, my God. 
[01:36:30]  He's going to look like he rode his 10-speed bike  through a mud puddle up the back.  I bet you when he pushes on those dumbs,  his little feet come up off the floor.  The little feet come up off the floor.  You've got to take off a little toilet paper  and unfog his glasses,  put them back on,  and fog up in the heat.  Hey!  Little feet up there.  Have you ever been in a bathroom, 
[01:37:00]  though, in that situation?  Like, there was one guy,  it was like a year ago,  that worked in the other office on the other,  that would be like,  in there.  That was horrible.  It's the worst.  I hate this guy.  The ah guy.  Hope's the fastest bathroom guy I've ever seen. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Dude, give me the key.  You'll be back.  You'll be back.  No.  And those are all dumps, too, man.  I don't mess around.  Perfect blonde surfer dumps.  Sit down,  they slide right out.  All right, we're healthy.  You're healthy.  Bye-bye now.  If they're fast,  it means you're doing a world of hurt to your underwear.  I know.  You're just pulling them off and running out.  Sometimes you've got to sit down  and let things cool down.  When do you want,  he knows it's time to go  and he feels a little tickle on his ankle. 
[01:38:00]  Your legs fall asleep,  you get off the ball  looking like a newborn fawn.  Got a butt hickey.  Dude, I was walking with my buddy Bill D'Angelo  to school when I was a little boy  and this is true.  I used to hate using public bathrooms.  I had a log fighting to get out.  Absolutely true story  and I was clenching  and I guess the front piece  made the escape when I clenched  and it dropped.  It's true.  Dropped down my...  And I kicked  and it came out  and I never lived that down.  I believe it was the fifth grade  on Newton Street 
[01:38:30]  in North Brunswick.  A little roly-poly piece of log.  Flew right out.  You're free.  I said it's free.  That's horrible.  I broke a piece off accidentally  and then left.  The first time I met Rick's wife,  we traveled down to Florida  to check out Rick  and his new girl there.  Yeah.  I crapped my pants.  Don't, don't.  No joke, he'll tell you.  Well, it was the most embarrassing thing 
[01:39:00]  ever happened to me.  I had shorts on  because it was summer  and they're like,  all right,  we're going to go drive to Orlando  and as they left,  five minutes later,  they're back in my apartment  and they're just like,  let me in, let me in, let me in.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's a lot better than that.  I was wearing boxers.  Boxers was, you know,  pretty in back then  and I was saying goodbye  to Rick and his girlfriend  on their stoop.  I thought I could let one slide out.  Oh, God.  That is awesome. 
[01:39:30]  Rolling right down my leg.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  That's terrible.  I spent the next hour  just teaching his bathroom  a lesson.  God, that's great. 
[01:40:00]  It's such a true story.  Oh, yeah.  They're right on the front, too.  We'll see you guys later.  I must say,  I don't think I've ever had one  let go on me.  You know,  when in doubt,  just clinch  and take the pain.  You guys remember  the year of the Boston Marathon,  the chick that ran?  Do you remember that?  Uda Pippig.  Yeah.  Uda.  She won the marathon  just with every fluid possible.  She was having her time  and diarrhea  at the same time.  Yeah,  as she crossed the finish line 
[01:40:30]  and they put that  foil blanket around there  and it was a mess.  Her pants look like  a hostess raspberry cake  exploded.  That was horrible.  Oh, it looks yummy  but it smells like copper.  Sometimes,  oh, you know you're done  and nothing else is happening  but you've just got to  sit it out.  Sit out the burn.  Wet a paper towel  and make a fire block. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Don't want your own wear.  What an awful conversation.  Women will never see  the joy of a good dump chat.  That's one thing  that will always separate  the same.  There's a guy out there.  I am crying.  I got tears coming down  my eyes from these stories.  Every guy's enjoying this.  They're all like,  yeah, man.  I really understand that.  Oh, God.  Every woman thinks  it's gross  and we should move on.  Horrid.  When I first moved to New York,  I had a few friends  over one night  in my old little apartment  and my friend Decker  went to the bathroom. 
[01:41:30]  It smelled so bad  I puked onto my screen  out in my courtyard  of my building  and all the puke,  it was that bad  as well.  The puke got caught  in the screen.  It was the most disgusting  I've ever.  Did I ever tell you  the time my buddies  Bill and Frank were over  and still Bill,  the same Bill I told you about  and this other dude, Frank,  and I took a s***  on a piece of  Pepperidge Farm white.  I swear to God,  just to be silly,  just to be a silly goose,  and I covered it  with another piece  of awful crumbly  Pepperidge Farm white  and put a little  club sandwich thing in it  and as a goop 
[01:42:00]  I showed them  and then I put it  in the street  and the car ran it over.  It's a true story.  Crumbly white  Pepperidge Farm.  Those times you have  that horrible realization  when you're well  past the bathroom  that you didn't  clean up well enough  as you're walking  you just know  this is really  going to be bad  when I get home.  And it starts to burn,  you feel like you have  a salty potato chip  in there.  Get home, 
[01:42:30]  your underwear  looks like a  shoeshine wreck.  Dude,  I was at my butt  not as true.  Wait,  careful.  And this is recently  in New York  he was out jogging  and he had an attack  of the stomach cramps  and he's like,  uh oh.  So he hops in a cab,  he can't even jog home,  he hops in a cab,  he looks like  a fourth floor walk up,  he makes it all the way up  as he's walking  into his apartment  he trips on the door jam  and just right  into his pants.  If he didn't trip 
[01:43:00]  you would have made it.  You would have made it fine  but then tripping  on the door jam  his stomach muscles  just went,  go for it!  There's that feeling  you get when you get close.  Your stomach muscles  start pushing you  immediately.  You're like,  oh my god,  I'm hearing you  going back and forth  from leg to leg  trying to get  the old trow down.  It's like your stomach  can see where you are  and it's like,  all right,  he's getting there,  let's get ready to go.  Too friggin' funny, man.  I took one in the woods  one time  on my way to steal comic books  with my buddy Paul  and I had actually  not made it  because I definitely had 
[01:43:30]  definitely the turtle  had poked his head out  and made that little  brown dime mark  like a little dime  stamped in my  and I'm in the woods  I swear to god  it's like a little  corporate seal  and I'm in the woods  still wax seal  on Napoleon's Communique.  You ever see like  little chocolate money?  That's what it looked like.  And so I obviously remove  and I'm standing there  and I'm finally getting  some relief  and there are yellow jackets  flying between my legs. 
[01:44:00]  I was near a beehive  and there were bees  buzzing back and forth  over my dump.  The ones in the woods  are great  when you're hunting  or camping  and before you're  even finished  before it even drops  the big green-eyed flies  are landing on it.  It's like at least  let it hit the goddamn ground.  And it just looks  so piping hot  when it's a little chilly  out the steam  coming off it.  Nice piping hot 
[01:44:30]  treat for flies.  Is there anything better  than a piping hot lock?  It's like a hot pocket.  That's 92.3 degrees.  Dude, you've got to mention  the gas paint.  The gas paint thing  is the worst.  I haven't done this  in a long time  but I almost didn't  make it recently  and when you go to  because I get really bad  stomach gas pains  and then you just  like your belt's undone  and you're just ready to sit  and then you get that  gas paint 
[01:45:00]  and you can't sit  so I'm standing there  and I'm like  it's going to come out  but I couldn't sit  because it felt like  somebody was stabbing me  in the stomach.  You're killing me.  Dude, I was at my buddy's  one time  and I would never wipe  good enough.  It's true.  Wait, careful.  Okay, I'm certain.  Let's just say that  I would continually do it  and always leave  a little residual evidence.  Never clean up good enough.  And I would always be  one time it was burning  and raw.  You know how you're like 12  and it gets raw and sore?  And I absolutely  I swear on my life  I saw a tube of  Aquafresh toothpaste. 
[01:45:30]  I'm like, boy,  that looks cool  and I dolloped  a big old  I dolloped a finger full  absolutely right in between  and it was wonderful  for 10 seconds.  And then it was  my balloon knot  was on fire.  I had to run back  in a Marvin's house.  Toothpaste.  All right.  Marvin Nash.  Buddy Marvin.  He's Jewish and Puerto Rican.  Oh, man.  I am...  Shicks never appreciate them.  I am woozy  from laughing so much.  Jesus Christ, you guys.  Girls, sit down.  Boom, boom.  Done. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  No.  He just dumped  his coffee  all over the place.  You lost your iced coffee.  I guess that's it.  That seems to be it.  It's the  You Who Pants  and Anthony show.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  The Alty  and Anthony show.  The Alty 
[01:46:30]  I've been waiting  for so long 
[01:47:00]  till I finally  found this one  to stay by me.  Yeah, we're riding  on the wall  and you felt  the magic  called fantasy.  Yeah, we're  watching it  in our lives  in the way  we could decide  to see  with me.  Something  that he just can  told me  they don't understand  just don't see. 
[01:47:30]  Just remember  what  you're the one  hanging along.  So I tell you  something  there could be  last thing  once  and  the time  of my life  that I never  felt  finished  before. 
[01:48:00]  Yes, I swear, it's the truth that I want you to do.  And my body and soul comes, you know that you'd ever know.  So don't just let it go, be afraid to lose control, no. 
[01:48:30]  Your voice or your mind, you say, stay with me tonight.  I can't get in the box, so I'll tell you something.  I can't get in the box, so I'll tell you something. 
[01:49:00]  I can't get in the box, so I'll tell you something.  I can't get in the box, so I'll tell you something.  I can't get in the box, so I'll tell you something. 
[01:49:30]  I can't get in the box, so I'll tell you something.  Oh, I had the time of my life 
[01:50:00]  And I never felt this way before  And I swear, it's the truth  And I owe it all to you  Oh, I had the time of my life  And I felt this way before

[01:52:30]  I saw it.  Like, as an Italian, it would be like something coming on and going,  Mamma mia!  Hey, after I eat a meat-a-ball, I go in my IROC and drive to the friggin' back.  You know, it's like one of those things. 
[01:53:00]  Hospitaliano!  You know?  Or a Jewish commercial going, hey, come to my bank.  I will lend you money.  You know?  It just seems like one of those things.  And this one is for some car place, and you get credit approval.  No matter what happens, you could be the OJ.  You get some credit approval.  But the girl from the credit company that's calling the guy,  it just paints a picture that seems a little stereotypical. 
[01:53:30]  Well, let's take a listen to my African friends.  All right, here it is.  Has Bad Credit Drama got your number?  Yes, we're calling about the unpaid deal.  When can we expect to pay?  Can we talk to your landlord?  Your mother?  Mother?  Tomorrow?  I'm calling your job.  If Bad Credit Drama has your number,  get Freeholds.  1-800-647-3340.

[01:54:30]  What'd I tell you?  What'd I tell you?  How's that for a top of all?  What'd I tell you?  She came to his house.  It's a little story.  It's the credit lady.  Dude, six months at the same address.  You could be on the lam.  And six months at the same address.  What'd I tell you?  What'd I tell you?  I call your landlord.  I call the landlord.  Don't make me call your job. 
[01:55:00]  But it just seemed to me like, yo job.  Don't make me call yo job.  Did they say yo job in that?  Give me that again.  Don't call that.  Get this.  Put y'all down and get the credit.  Can I do a number?  Yes, we're calling about the unpaid deal.  When can we expect the payment?  Can we talk to your landlord?  Yo, your mother, mother, tomorrow.  I'm calling your job.  Yo job.  I don't know my father.  You can't talk to my mom, but my grandmom is here.  Hey, Dave, what's up?  That cannot be a real commercial. 
[01:55:30]  It is.  It's a real commercial.  You have got to be kidding me.  It sounds like discrimination.  Well, I think they're targeting a certain group, if I may say.  That was delicate.  That seems to be a strategic spot designated to impact a certain targeted group.  A certain demo.  Right.  The only group they miss were the crackhead.  If you've been at the same address for six months. 
[01:56:00]  All right, Dave, thank you.  Anthony, there's another commercial I'm outraged by.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  I'd like to play it for you.  Y'all be going on vacation?  See, the thing is, if you about to be up out this biatch, check it.  Peep Delta.  We be flying all over this bitch.  Let me ask you something.  Listen, you fend to raise up and get your travel on?  From the interior to the exterior, you've got to get your posterior in one of these big-ass planes. 
[01:56:30]  Shit, dog.  You lay in the cut straight sitting on your ass and getting your drink on and your snack on  while we floss and fly this mofo all over this bitch.  East coast?  West coast?  It don't matter.  Nia, we'll get you to your ho and back lickety splits.  No shit.  Then you'll be back at your crib chilling with a flat spliff, thinking we were some crazy-ass angel.  Hell, these fat, round, thick-ass vessels run up in the sky so deep, get feet crying. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, you thought it was rain.  So bring a towel, because at Delta, it's laid out like that.  Call one of these fly-ass Delta coochies, and make all them punk-ass co-workers of yours  catch the vapors as you be off and about.  You going?  We fly, you dare.  You bin?  We done already flew up in there.  We got you covered like a jimmy hat.  At Delta, we loved us some flying, and it'd be showing like a mother-f***er.  I love that one.  I'm a little outraged there. 
[01:57:30]  That's a great commercial for Delta.  Well, there you have it.  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, did you ever see that commercial?  It has Eric Estrada on it, and it's like for smoke signal communications.  The guy's like, if you don't have any ID, don't worry about it.  If you don't have any credit cards, don't worry about it.  You'll get a phone today.  No problem.  I'm Eric Estrada.  Call smoke signal.  You ever see that one?  Eric Estrada is the one selling it, huh?  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  Interesting.  Again, maybe targeting a certain... 
[01:58:00]  Cool, Glenn.  Thank you.  All righty.  Herb's wife works for this dealership.  Herb.  Yeah, how you doing?  What's up?  Yeah, my wife works over at the Chevy dealer at Freehold.  They're calling like crazy right now.  Oh, yeah?  There we go.  I think we're...  Tell her you to phone call.  She's going postal.  I think we're impacting the place, and we're getting some business.  There you go.  All right, man.  See you guys later.  All right.  Do you want to hear the rest of that again?  Yeah, I just got to hear the end part.  If bad credit drama has your number, 1-800-647-3340, reestablish credit with an approved car loan at Freehold Chevrolet. 
[01:58:30]  We don't care if you're divorced, a single parent, retired, or on a fixed income.  We just care about getting you approved.  We'll be there.  1-800-647-3340.  Freehold Chevrolet is ready to approve you now on a car, truck, or SUV.  And not just Chevy.  At least one year on your job?  Call now.  Six months at the same address?  Call now.  If you need to establish good credit...  All right.  I know you're in there.  Pick up the phone. 
[01:59:00]  Call now.  1-800-647-3340.  The number that gets you new credit and a car.  From Freehold Chevrolet.  1-800-647-3340.  The approval may require a substantial down payment.  Dealer retains rights to provide select vehicles.  What'd I tell you?  It's like, I'll answer.  How's that for a topper?  Don't make me come up in there, nigga.  Yeah.  Wow.  Woo.  Ken, what's going on? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, ONA, man.  You guys rule.  I'd like to comment on...  I heard that Delta commercial the other day on another radio station, Hot 97.  Yeah.  It had me dying at work.  I could not.  My boss almost...  Get back to...  No, that wasn't that one.  That was just a real Delta commercial from Hot 97.  Yeah, there's a big difference there.  Flip, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  This is Flip from Jersey.  Yeah.  It's like every commercial nowadays is like a ghetto commercial for some reason.  Well, yeah.  They're targeting us real bad, huh?  Yeah, but they do it with every group. 
[02:00:00]  They really do.  I mean, any one of those goddamn Olive Garden commercials, I cringe as an Italian just watching  it.  Hey, when my grandfather from Italy comes here, we take him to the Olive Garden.  And I'm like, oh, my God.  Who the hell would go there?  You know, it's funny to me, though.  We take him to the sauce just like Aunt Millie made.  It's funny to me, because through the whole commercial, they said, how do you keep your  man?  And they said, chicken is how you keep your man.  And then she starts singing about Laurie chicken. 
[02:00:30]  It's horrible, man.  She starts singing about him.  Every word is chicken, chicken, chicken.  It's horrible.  It's funny to me, though.  Hey, Flip, do you like chicken?  I love chicken, buddy.  There you go.  Hey, you love chicken?  Yeah, I love chicken.  Chicken's great, man.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with chicken.  We just love it a little more.  Just don't want us to sit down with more liquor.  All right.  Okay.  Wow.  You are, bro.  All right.  Thanks, Flip.  Thanks, folks.  All right.  Let's go to George.  George, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to ask if you guys could see that commercial with Joe Montana and Ronnie 
[02:01:00]  Lott.  That's a funny commercial.  All of a sudden, Joe Montana is ready to smear the crotch cream on Ronnie Lott.  Yep.  He's just two fingers full, and he's going to put it in his pants, and he cuts to what the  real commercial's about.  But it's so funny.  Junk itch penetrates your crotch area.  And they show, like, the drawing with the red inflamed area.  But just two fingers full of this, takes a big tub out, gloops it out.  It's all goopy on his finger.  And he's ready to, like, touch Ronnie Lott's junk. 
[02:01:30]  That's pretty funny.  Thank you, George.  We don't care if you have ten kids.  We don't care if you live with your moms.  We don't care if you smack your bitch.  We don't even care if you can't read.  Come down.  Get credit.  Where's your ass, Mother Effa?  I calling you.  You ain't that.  You know that.  Where's my money, Mother?  Open the goddamn door.  Why am I still on the phone if I'm in the door?  Open the goddamn door. 
[02:02:00]  What'd I tell you?  O.J.?  O.J.?  I'm at the gate waiting.  O.J.?  O.J.?  I'm in the limo.  Your limo's here.  O.J.?  How did I get in there?  O.J., I just saw you walk past the front door with the black sweats and the hood.  O.J.?  O.J.?  O.J., no credit necessary. 
[02:02:30]  Call now.  What'd I tell you?  Drop the glove, O.J.?  All right.  Yeah, when you hit the air conditioner.  All right, Dan, let's regroup.  More to come.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ron Reagan, American Badass.  Remember that, when he took over from Carter, who was just like, you know, running the country 
[02:03:00]  into the ground?  God, he was such a pussy.  And then all of a sudden, but Reagan, he didn't give a flying F what anyone said.  He had his policies.  He enacted them.  And he didn't care what anyone said.  You know what?  These guys are so wishy-washy on both ends.  God damn.  Like him or hate him, I would have to say Reagan was the last real leader of this country.  And who knows how much he actually led, but at least he made a good figurehead.  There you go.  You know, at least you were getting the illusion that this guy was in charge.  I don't care.  Another couple of years go by, and they're going to remember Bill Clinton for a hummer 
[02:03:30]  in the White House.  A hummer in the White House.  That's all.  Believe me.  All the good stuff.  And yeah, we've had eight years of prosperity.  It's been really nice and everything.  But 20, 30, 40 years down the road, oh yeah, Bill Clinton, the B.J. president.  I remember him.  Remember Reagan, though?  He got in office.  The Iranians gave back all the hostages the next day.  That was it.  It's like, okay, we understand this guy.  That was a big change, whether you liked it or not.  At least there was something changed.  People realized he was out of his mind, and he didn't have all of his mind. 
[02:04:00]  Remember Reagan's little guffaw on the mic?  The bombing starts in five minutes.  God damn, what a set of nuts on that guy.  He's over a satellite that's beamed everywhere, and he talks about the Russians.  The bombing starts.  Ooh, is this on?  I loved that.  Just to even joke about that.  To joke about it while these missiles are sitting there rumbling, waiting at launch at  each other.  They rumbled for like eight straight years.  And the Russians are like, did he just say the bombing starts in five minutes? 
[02:04:30]  You know, they were probably like on a phone or just watching it.  What did he say?  A rock.  And the goddamn guy can take a bullet, too.  Let's not forget it.  Cancer, he shot.  Look at that.  That's a leader.  He's got to deal with that wife of his.  The guy now has no brain left, and he still goes around.  He's like Spock.  When they took Spock's brain out, he just walks around.  But goddamn, he's still kicking.  I picture a shield high above the earth that will protect us from enemy missiles. 
[02:05:00]  We're calling it Star Wars.  And I was like, what?  Wow, Star Wars.  This guy.  I saw the movie.  It's great.  Now, this guy wants to build that stuff.  This man's fantastic.  And you're amazed because at home, all you're doing is playing Pong, and this guy has this  vision of Star Wars.  I'm like, goddamn.  That will eliminate incoming missiles.  What?  Wait, eliminate?  This is great.  Like Missile Command?  Just like Missile Command, Ronnie Reagan, right? 
[02:05:30]  He was just playing.  Whatever.  He was just playing Atari at home and had all these.  It was a great grand idea.  Mommy, look at this game.  If we can, well, get this around the world.  Imagine all of a sudden, you know, Russian missiles coming.  Look, Mommy, I got the high score.  Me one, Russians nothing.  Yes. 
[02:06:00]  I picture a big yellow ball with a mouth eating the Russians going, wacka, wacka, wacka.  And then, well, if it gets far from a base, there'll be power pills.  And it will eat inky and binky and binky.  That's what I figure.  Yes.  Because, you see, depending on whatever game he gets himself into.  I picture a missile defense system that hits the missiles back and forth and goes, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop. 
[02:06:30]  And the first one to win, miss with a paddle, loses.  Yes.  Hello?  You've just heard the sound from NORAD.  We are victorious.  I picture a defense system where a giant gorilla throws barrels at the Russians as they hop on a conveyor belt. 
[02:07:00]  Our Italian allies will help with Mario.  They will jump around, trying not to get eaten by plants and whatnot.  My defense system is a frog that tries to jump across a crowded street.  God damn, is that funny.  God damn, Reagan.  You've got to love him, though.  Hell yeah.  You know what's great, too, about his idea?  Is that they came up with all the graphics. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, the graphics are great.  You'd see, like, the missile launch in space.  This big retro rocket would fire, and this can-shaped thing would launch a laser beam.  You're like, oh, this is fantastic.  This is effing beautiful, man.  That was 20 years ago.  What do we got now?  Nothing.  If Ronnie was still in, forget it.  With the video games out now?  I picture a defense system where you drive a car through the streets of New York and hit everything and nothing happens. 
[02:08:00]  Our cities will be as indestructible as those games.  I'm appointing Lara Croft, head of our defense system, because she's a bad bitch.  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027, WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Manny in the studio helping us out, and the fine female cops, Lisa and Karen.  Very pretty cops.  I was very surprised. 
[02:08:30]  I was expecting two beasts to enter the studio.  I've got to be honest with you.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  And Anthony's up first, I guess.  It's time to resist an arrest.  I don't want to be first.  This sucks.  I was hanging out with Jay Moore.  It was like one in the morning when we left Paisano's.  I didn't even get to sleep until like two.  You knew we were coming.  So now you've got an excuse when they kick your ass right now.  Yeah, I know.  I'm kind of pussying that.  You better go for me.  I'll probably skip the key on the brother. 
[02:09:00]  Anthony has taken his...  Wait, she says the rules now,  because she gets all the guys on their knees  with their hands behind their head  before you even approach them?  No, we can't.  Absolutely.  So what, you say like, you know,  get on your knees.  Get on your knees, hands above your head.  And then you holster your weapon,  walk up to them with your cuffs,  and then the second you touch one of us,  then we can start the resisting.  You got it.  So that we're going to start on our knees?  Yeah.  Oh, we got a couple...  It's probably for our own benefit, 
[02:09:30]  to tell you the truth,  because if she flips a leg out,  we're just going to go on the floor anyway.  All right, well, Ann, get up.  You're first.  Oh, this blows.  Lisa is convinced she could get Anthony  handcuffed within 30 seconds.  Oh, nice.  How are you?  Lisa, you have a real nice body, by the way.  That little belly shirt going on.  Dude, check out the other one.  Yo.  Wow, they're both really nice.  All right.  Oh, no.  All right, Anthony is...  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me explain.  Ann, get a mic.  Rick, get a mic to Anthony. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, get a mic.  Ann, turn the other way  so you can face right into the mic.  All right, Anthony is on his knees.  All right, hold on.  Ann, you got your knees...  Your legs crossed behind you, too?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Lisa is behind Anthony.  Anthony is putting his hands in front of him  like they're against the wall.  He's on his knees.  His legs are crossed behind him.  Lisa's got the handcuffs.  Wait, who's got the stopwatch?  I got it.  All right.  I got it. 
[02:10:30]  Rick, you tell him when to go, okay?  All right.  I'll give you a five-second countdown, okay?  Wait, you're starting from that position?  Hey, hey, oh, what is this, man?  Hey, where y'all be arresting people at?  In Beverly Hills.  Right.  Yeah, we got to, like, fight a little bit.  Anthony's got...  Wait, wait.  Anthony's in...  Hey, you're fagging out already.  My mistakes.  Oh, Anthony's just going to be a cop-out.  Ant's got his hands behind his head.  He's on his knees.  Okay, ready? 
[02:11:00]  All right, hold on, hold on.  Ready, set, go.  Go.  All right, Ant's fighting.  Whoa!  The cops got him down.  They are struggling with Anthony.  Oh, my God!  They're all over him.  Oh, my goodness.  Ant's fighting.  I'm loving this.  Ant's fighting like a mother.  Ant's fighting.  Okay, Lisa's got one arm, and the other cop's got the other arm, and is getting busted up.  His face is crunched against the couch.  They both have him down.  All right.  Oh!  He's up.  He's up.  He's fighting.  He's fighting.  God, I feel like I'm watching an episode of Cops. 
[02:11:30]  It's at 20 seconds.  Ant's fighting.  Lisa's got him down.  Oh, Ant's running.  Ant's running.  He's done.  He's done.  He's making his way for the door.  He's making his way for the door.  They're fighting.  Oh, they nailed him.  Oh, my God.  This is like Fight Club.  We just hit 30 seconds.  All right.  I think Anthony is tiring.  Lisa's on his back.  Karen's got the one arm.  Lisa's got the other arm.  Oh, my God.  All right.  One handcuff is on, and here goes the other handcuff.  Karen is screaming at him to put his other hand around his back, and Anthony is... 
[02:12:00]  I can't see a thing.  You're going to have to let me know.  Anthony is cuffed.  Cuffed at 58 seconds.  Hey, but they kicked his ass.  They did kick his ass.  Wow.  He ain't moving.  Holy cow.  All right.  Get Ant up so he can talk.  Oh, they're even lifting him up.  Goddamn, Ant.  You look like a criminal right now.  Yeah.  He does.  He is out of breath.  He's on the lesbian couch right now. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, my God.  I know his number one handcuff is so tight.  Wait.  Get a mic.  Get a mic on him.  Yo.  He's not moving from that couch, though.  Hey, I got it.  I got it.  Holy.  All right.  You girls are kind of tough.  All right, Ant.  He's out.  Yeah.  Ant is exhausted on the couch.  I'm feeling in my right thumb.  Ah.  He made a nice dash for the door.  If he could have gotten out of that door, he was home.  Oh, yeah.  Ant, how do you feel?  Exhausted.  You look it.  Woo!  Hey.  Ladies, I must say, that was very impressive. 
[02:13:00]  Wow.  She cuffed you.  She's got a belly shirt on.  The choke hold.  They put you in a choke hold?  I didn't see that.  Choke hold.  I felt myself slipping away.  All right.  They're taking the handcuffs off, Ant.  Ant, I think you're officially part of Fight Club as well, by the way.  Yeah.  Because that was like resisting arrest and Fight Club all in the same thing, man.  Hey, Ant, you didn't fag out at all, baby.  Man, I was trying to get out the door.  Ant, you almost made it to the door.  All right, Ant's getting back to his little area in the studio.  Dude, let me tell you something. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  At first, you could tell they were being a little gentle.  Like seeing how far I was going to take it.  At the point I tried to run away, I was put in a choke hold.  I saw that.  My head thrust to the floor.  I saw that.  The one cuff was kind of twisted on my arm.  I thought my wrist was going to break.  And then I just gave up.  I went, okay, okay.  And I actually said the F word.  Like I was really being arrested.  I'm like, stop.  They got me. 
[02:14:00]  Look at how happy they are.  Oh, wow.  All right, how long did I last?  58 seconds.  All right, that's not bad.  Just to prove to you guys out there that we can do it.  That was pretty impressive.  Now, Karen, how tall are you?  We know Lisa's like 5'1 or so.  I'm about 5'5.  Holy Jesus, man.  I'm going to give us warm water.  Whew.  Well, you're a cop.  Isn't that going to give you the good stuff?  I'm just kidding.  You're next, all right?  Man, you ever see that happen in the neighborhood?  I would be nice to follow you.  Yeah, all too many times. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, Manny, this is like a nightmare for you, isn't it?  Only rarely it's a white guy like me.  No, you believe me.  Thanks, Bess.  20 seconds in, you was the average criminal, Ant.  I was.  I was fighting for my freedom.  When your hat came off, you was a cocaine smuggler.  What's up, my brothers?  Why are we being oppressed?  I'm going to start calling you Khali.  Yeah.  That was impressive.  All right, do I have to go next?  I don't want to go now, man.  Come on, don't.  All right, I'll go.  You're next.  I'll go. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, man, I'm going to look bagged up.  I've got to get a mic closer.  Boy, these ladies are rough, man.  The harder you fight, the more they will fight you.  Dude, after seeing what you went through, I'm, like, shaking right now.  Whew.  Oh, God.  My heart is pounding, man.  All right, Opie's down on his knees.  I thought the lesbian's got my heart pounding.  Forget about it.  Nah, this is good stuff.  Now, were they able to get the first cuff on before you started fighting, or how did 
[02:15:30]  Let me tell you, the second you feel metal on your wrist, you could start resisting.  But the second you feel it, one is cuffed.  I mean, it's very hard.  I think Opie's going down quick.  See, brother, let's get the timer, too.  I got the timer ready.  Let me know when you guys are ready.  Hey, help me out, man.  You got my back, right?  Can I do that?  No, you can't.  There's one.  Oh, oh, there they go.  There it is.  Opie's on the floor, man.  They are fighting him.  Oh, wow.  They are fighting, man.  They're riding him.  All right. 
[02:16:00]  They're both on top of him.  They got him in that damn hold.  He's kicking his legs.  I just saw two legs fly up.  Wow.  Is he screaming?  Yeah.  Yo, this is real.  I don't know if I'm doing this.  One arm's back.  He's at 20 seconds now.  Holy.  All right.  I have a fuckball.  She's got him almost between her legs.  He is fighting, man.  And 30 seconds.  Yo, they are playing rough.  Yes.  They've got his head pinned to the floor. 
[02:16:30]  He's cuffed.  He's cuffed.  Wow.  Wow.  Dump out.  Dump out.  I dumped.  I dumped.  I dumped.  Oh, they kicked your ass, man.  Come on.  Get up.  Get up.  Get up, Convict.  Wow.  Get up, you criminal.  That was in 39 seconds.  How about that?  Holy crap.  You freely give that last hand over when they start hurting you.  39 seconds, dude.  Holy cow.  I honestly thought it was going to last a minute, but they were pulling that right hand 
[02:17:00]  so hard.  It hurts so bad.  You know what?  You freely give up the uncuffed hand.  It hurts so bad.  It's like, all right, it's over.  It's like, I was trying to stay as long as I could, and then it just hurts so much.  I know.  That's how they got me.  Look at my wrist.  That's how they got me, dude.  Good luck.  Yeah.  Wow.  It was like a rodeo.  The way legs were flying up.  Dude, the way your legs were kicking up like a freaking Bronco. 
[02:17:30]  I don't know what else to do.  Rick could be a rough one.  Look at his guns he's got.  Look at the arms on him.  I just got my ass kicked by a girl that's like 5'1", 95 pounds.  He's been beat up by girls.  All right.  Well, Rick is up next.  Rick's got a couple of guns on him there.  If you look at his arms there, ladies.  We'll see if he's packing.  Ah.  Yeah, I didn't like the grabbing of the cojones.  I don't know.  After getting my face smashed into the rug, it was a little too much.  You got to do what you got to do.  I understand that, Karen. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you.  All right.  And you're making your way over there?  Yeah.  Okay.  I got to be able to see this, you know.  All right.  Rick is on his knees.  Wait.  Who's got the watch for Rick?  Who's got the stopwatch?  All right.  Spaz.  Oh, Spaz is going to keep time.  Uh-oh.  I'm just kidding.  What are you talking about?  All right.  Rick is on his knees.  On his knees.  His hands are behind his head.  His hands are behind his head.  The second they touch, the time starts, Spaz.  Oh, they're going.  All right.  Rick's face on the ground.  He's curled up in the fetal position. 
[02:18:30]  They got both of their arms around his head.  Double headlock.  His one wrist is cuffed.  He's sitting up now.  Wow.  They're having a tough time with Rick.  He's on his stomach.  No, he's back up on his knees.  Whoa.  The one chick stepped on his ankle.  Whoa.  He's screaming, Anthony.  Yeah.  They are really pulling out all the dirty tricks for Rick.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Rick's doing quite well.  All right.  The cops are getting crushed.  They're having a tough time getting that arm on the hook. 
[02:19:00]  Take him out.  Oh, there he goes.  His face just went into the floor.  All right.  Hold.  Watch those cart racks.  All right.  All right.  Rick is screaming.  They're just bending his arm now.  Rick is screaming.  He's on his floor.  Rick is screaming in pain.  He doesn't want to give up that arm.  He doesn't want to give up the arm, but he's going to have to.  Here we go.  Here he comes.  Give it up, Rick.  He went a minute.  He went a minute so far.  He's running out of steam, though, Ant.  He is really resisting, man. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, they got the chokehold on him now, man.  They almost had that arm behind him twice.  There it goes.  There it goes.  One arm.  He's rolling back over again.  No one talking trash, though.  Everyone is saving their breath.  Oh, my God.  She's got him in the chokehold.  Rick is exhausted.  Rick is exhausted.  We're up to a minute and a half.  Oh.  Rick doing a great job here.  A minute and a half.  Oh, there it is.  Rick has lost control of his butt. 
[02:20:00]  His butt is kind of.  Whoa.  He is putting up a fight.  There's stuff flying.  A minute 45.  Oh, he's grabbing the package.  That's not good.  I knew Rick would put up a good fight.  He's got them arms.  Yeah, I know.  That's true, too.  They're a little tired from cuffing Ant and I, but Rick is definitely.  Watch the cart rack.  Two.  Two.  Two.  And Rick's definitely doing a good job here.  Oh, he said ow.  That's not a good sign.  No, he's not. 
[02:20:30]  He is not giving up, man.  The one cop has her knee on Rick's throat right now.  On his head.  On his head.  Oh, Rick is screaming.  Oh, look.  He goes, all right, all right.  Time.  Time.  Two minutes.  15 seconds.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Son of a whore, he says.  He is in pain.  The girls are exhausted.  The more you fight, the more they'll fight, Rick.  Them's the rules.  Oh, they want to leave him cuffed.  All right. 
[02:21:00]  Whoa.  Rick is not getting up.  You all right, Rick?  He's exhausted.  Look at that.  That was brutal.  Fight club.  That was brutal.  That was great.  I saw a knee on Rick's cheek at one point.  Rick is the champion.  He lasted two minutes, 15 seconds.  His face was, you know something?  Rick can take some pain because that cuffed hand was just turning white.  Oh, look at his wrist.  Damn, man.  Look how tight they had that cuffed.  He wouldn't give up.  Rick, grab a mic. 
[02:21:30]  Look at that.  They got you good.  Rick, what was the breaking point where you finally said, all right, all right.  What was hurting so bad?  I thought I was going to get something.  I heard one point you said, all right, all right.  Yeah, it's because the cuff got so tight right there on that vein.  Yeah, yeah.  It's called black now.  Yeah.  That's where it was just like, okay, I don't want to break anything.  Right.  You all right, Rick?  We're sorry if we heard that.  Look at his nose.  He's got a bloody nose.  Oh, you got, oh.  What's that little move you do to take out the ankle? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, you step on that ankle and you're pushing it in and they can't do anything.  Yeah.  It hurts.  It's very painful.  Rick bleeding from the nose.  Wow, he's bleeding from his nose.  Bravo.  We got blood.  We got blood.  All right.  We like blood on the Opium Anthem show.  Wow.  I must say, ladies, that's quite impressive.  Look at Rick.  I've never seen his hair messed up before.  He's a rat.  He started fresh. 
[02:22:30]  We started after cuffing, too, other people prior to that.  So it took a little while.  Yeah, but Anthony's like a girl.  He was kind of tough.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  I don't think girls need any excuses.  I think you did great.  Thank you.  Look at the cart rack.  Look at the leaning tower of the cart rack.  We've got to fix the studio before we get out of here today.  Woo.  I was really turned on for a second there.  Yeah, for a second.  You see what she did to your package to try to make you resist?  I had a face full of my own stuff.  Yeah, you were completely in the snail position. 
[02:23:00]  Manny, what do you think?  I'm pretty impressed.  I'm pretty impressed.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  I can't take anything away from the girls.  You guys are pretty tough.  What a show this has been, huh, Ant?  Woo.  I'm exhausted.  Rick looks out.  Yeah.  Rick, you look completely sped.  Rick, let's see the rest, man.  Between hypnotism and getting his ass beat up.  I hope Rick's wife doesn't come looking for us.  Wow, look at that wrist, man.  Damn, that's good.  He was using, like, his ass almost as a block so you couldn't get the arm back around. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, at one point he used his ass to push me into that rack there.  That's when you have to knee them in the cheek.  That's when you have to knee them in the head.  I saw the knee on the cheek, which was a great move.  Your face was squished, Rick.  It was just like...  What's your name again?  Karen.  Karen.  Karen's stepping on my ankle.  She's stomping on it like that.  Yeah, she's kicking me.  I'm like, what the hell?  Karen scares me.  Like, Lisa does it with a smile.  Karen has this look on her face when she's doing it.  You don't want to mess with it.  You got to get the job done. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  I understand that.  You're more than capable.  I'd hate to be married to her.  The Alty and Anthony Show.  Alty and Anthony Association, may I help you?  Hello?  I have this number in my wallet.  I don't know where I am.  You don't know where you are?  I have this number in my wallet.  You're lost?  I don't know.  I'm at a phone booth.  Give me the phone number.  It's not on here. 
[02:24:30]  There's no phone number on the phone?  Let me look.  What phone?  You're calling from a phone.  Is there a phone number there?  Yes, there is.  Could I have the phone number?  I believe it's the 8th.  Hold on the phone.  Can you hold on?  Don't hang up.  Hello?  Yes.  Can you hear me?  Who's this?  This is a cell.  Can you hear me?  Hello?  Don't hang the phone up.  Hang up?  No.  Do not hang up.  Hold on, please.  Don't hang up.  I'm going to put you on the phone with someone else.  Hold on.  Hang up what? 
[02:25:00]  No.  It's cold.  You're cold?  I'm colder, yes.  I know.  It's cold like Brazil.  Do you know?  I believe I need a change.  Stay on the phone.  I'm wet.  You're all wet?  Yeah, I'm wet.  Okay.  Well, you just stay on the phone.  I need a change and then my nurse isn't here.  And do you know the phone number?  I'm going to walk across.  Where you are?  Can you tell me the number?  Can you see it?  Walk across the street now.  Don't stay on the phone.  Don't walk across.  Who's this now?  My name is Judy.  What's yours?  I call my name's Bill. 
[02:25:30]  Bill.  Hi, Bill.  How are you?  Hi, Sam.  You sound a little lost.  I'm going to walk across the street now.  You know what?  I'd rather you didn't walk across the street because if you walk across the street, I can't  talk to you.  Whoa, hey.  Hey, Bill.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Yeah.  Are you still there?  Who is this, please?  This is Judy.  Is this Bill?  Where's Sam?  Sam just went out to get some coffee.  I hate coffee.  Oh.  Sam knows I hate coffee. 
[02:26:00]  Well, maybe he went to get you a coffee and he said he was going out to get a drink.  There's cars now.  A lot of cars.  What?  I'm going to cross the street now.  You know what?  If there are a lot of cars, you shouldn't be crossing the street.  All right.  Here I go.  I can't talk to you.  I think my home is across the street.  Here I go.  Are you talking on the phone, Bill?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, we should have called the police while we had him. 
[02:26:30]  What do you see when he says he's still here?  Call the phone.  He did not hang up.  He put the phone down.  He dropped the phone.  He did not hang up.  Oh, my God!  Someone call an ambulance!  See?  I told you.  Now, this is horrible.  Oh, my God, he looks awful.  Jesus!  Who is this?  Who am I speaking to, please?  Somebody call an ambulance!  Help over here!  The man got hit!  This is horrible.  We're calling an ambulance.  Can you give me the address?  He's a mess!  The man got hit!  Someone call an ambulance! 
[02:27:00]  Don't touch him!  Leave him down there!  Hello?  Can you give me...  Tell me where you are.  It's too late!  It's too late!  There's this mad spirit all over the road.  Can you tell me where you are?  It's too late!  I've let you get a shovel!  All right, we'll get a shovel.  Where are you?  It's too late!  It isn't too late.  It's too late!  What do you mean it's not too late?  It's over there and it's all too... 
[02:27:30]  Can't help you if you won't tell us where you are.  You can't help anymore!  That's pretty a shovel!  Can you tell me where you are right now?  Disneyland!  In Disneyland!  Can you tell me where in Disneyland?  Pirates of the Caribbean!  And the Pirates of the Caribbean!  Yo-ho!  Yo-ho!  A pirate's life for me!  I'm okay now!  You're okay? 
[02:28:00]  You got all pulled yourself together again?  A car hit me and I feel fine now.  Oh, I'm so glad you feel fine.  Why would you have me really worried?  That's all Bill needed was a little bumper.  Can you tell me where you are, Bill?  Jupiter!  On Jupiter?  Planet Jupiter!  Is there a street number or a name on planet Jupiter?  23 Jupiter!  23 Jupiter!  23!  Okay, do you live there?  Send a cab! 
[02:28:30]  Send a cab!  I would happily send a cab to tell me where to send it.  You tell them to make a right at Venus.  Right at Venus?  And it's Jupiter, 28 Jupiter.  28?  That's what I said.  Okay.  And what are you doing there now?  Mash!  Oh, I see!  Hello, America!  Opie and Anthony want you to vote for boobs! 
[02:29:00]  Wait a minute, that can't be right.  Vote now for your favorite WOW contestant on opieandanthony.com.  Then August 8th, Opie and Anthony will announce the top 20 finalists on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027-WNAW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show!  On the hotline, Ted Nugent! 
[02:29:30]  That's beautiful.  Gunfire for Uncle Ted.  Uncle Teddy, baby!  Antonio, how are you boys doing?  It's been a long time, my friend.  Yes, you miss me, don't you?  I love when you...  Why don't you get rid of the damn music and just shoot some more damn guns off?  Well, we actually have a bunch of people that have been calling up and shooting their guns for us. 
[02:30:00]  I love that.  Around the country.  I love that.  We had a beautiful AR-15.  Beautiful.  Only one?  Yeah, it was great, though.  You know, we got the MTV Crip Boys coming in here next week to film the Nugent Estate here.  I got more damn guns than all them boys combined.  I got guns behind every door.  I'm going to just have like a firepower orgy right there on MTV and make them just blood.  Hey, are you going to hide anything before they get there?  No, they're just going to invite them in, open the gate, let them make themselves at home. 
[02:30:30]  There's got to be something you're thinking.  You know what?  Maybe this isn't ready for national TV.  No, Mrs. Nugent thought we got to clean the place up, and I went, no way.  Does it fly?  We're going to have some gut piles in the living room with dead fish flopping around the kitchen.  We're going to have all kinds of beautiful things.  Gut piles.  Gut piles, baby.  Story of my life.  I'll tell you, you would make our day if you shut off one of your weapons at the end of this.  You know, I could go to the other phone.  I could touch off more damn firepower than Uncle Sam did in WW2, boys.  Ted, we would love that.  Are you serious? 
[02:31:00]  We would love that.  It's so easy.  I got a choice.  I got a Benelli 90 right here with eight rounds of triple-out buck.  I got a Glock model 20 and 10 millimeter with four extra magazines.  That's just on my damn belt.  Same belt I was wearing in your studio that day.  You're wearing them.  I've got a Remington 700 and 22, 250, and I got a Remington 788 and 243.  They're all literally, I'm touching them right now.  Oh, you got to switch phones.  I'm fondling massive firepower.  I just can't shoot upstairs here in the office.  You got to switch phones, man.  We've been doing this.  I can do it.  I can go downstairs and switch phones. 
[02:31:30]  I got a deck.  I got 2,000 acres that is one big firing range.  Because we've been doing it for the last couple days, and a lot of people are getting off on it.  Yeah, gunpowder's cool, man.  I don't sniff cocaine.  I sniff gunpowder.  Nice.  Yeah, it's beautiful.  Black cocaine.  We're checking out Kill It and Grill It there.  How could you not?  Life is a barbecue, gentlemen.  The new book by Ted Nugent.  We've got a grill going outside right now.  It's like our Cochise is looking for communication through smoke.  It's so beautiful.  We've got venison and dead pigs.  We've got a bunch of bluegill fillets. 
[02:32:00]  My son and his buddies, they caught a whole mess of bluegills this morning.  So we're having a flesh spirit orgy right now.  It's like Little House on the Prairie.  Oh, it's Big House on the Swamp.  Big difference.  Well, first off, I've got to tell you, your wife is beautiful.  How beautiful is she?  Yeah, that's smart, putting her on the cover of the book, man.  Oh, Anthony, I want to hear it from both of you in harmony.  Nugent, you're a lucky son of a bitch.  Say it.  Yes, yes, Nugent, you are a lucky son of a bitch.  Thank you very much.  Drive safely.  You married a piece of ass.  How about that?  The finest, the finest twanger on planet Earth. 
[02:32:30]  You've got the rifle with you.  She's got the cooking utensils.  Wang day, sweet poontang.  It's not a song, boys.  It's a mindset.  What's the most exotic meat you've ever cooked up?  A black girl backstage at the Grandy Ballroom.  No, I've eaten gut piles with the natives in Zimbabwe and the Sudan.  I ran with the other side.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What's gut piles?  Gut piles, that's the innards.  That's like the...  I know, of what animal and why?  Well, that was with...  I was hunting with... 
[02:33:00]  I think it's in the Kill It and Grill It book.  I hunted in the Sudan.  I was the last white guy there.  How white, we don't know.  But I was there running with the Maasai and the Watusi.  And it was when Idi Amin and his boys came in and decided to kill everybody.  So these guys ran me out of the country.  They showed me the way out.  And when I ran with these guys, we stopped in these villages.  There's no roads.  There's no nothing.  I just ran with these big, tall basketball stars, man.  And they were naked.  They were cool.  They liked me because I could kill stuff with a bow and arrow way out there. 
[02:33:30]  And I ran with them.  And we ate some stuff.  You know, we only stopped after dark.  And I couldn't tell what it was.  I know I shot a beautiful, big roan antelope.  It's like a big horse.  It's a real wary antelope.  And I shot this.  And it's highly prized for its guts and the insides.  That's what they get all their protein and fat from.  Really?  These guys, they don't cook it up.  But we had a fire going at one of these little grass hut villages.  And they cooked some of this stuff up for me.  And I'll tell you, I don't know what it was.  But, boy, it was good. 
[02:34:00]  But it was cooked?  It wasn't just...  No, I wasn't going to...  These guys reach right into the still-throbbing guts and pull out the liver and the pancreas  and start slicing and eating right there.  That's sushi for those guys.  Yeah, it is.  Absolutely.  Plus, it's the highest form of protein and fat.  And they need that stuff.  But, you know, I'm an adventurous guy.  But I ain't that adventurous.  So I didn't eat that stuff.  But we put a little fire to it.  It was good.  Now, Ted, is it true that you eat everything you shoot?  Absolutely.  Except we don't...  We kill a lot of coons and possums and skunks and coyotes and fox. 
[02:34:30]  We don't eat them.  But we use all the skins and everything from them.  Yeah, but there's a picture of your son holding up a squirrel.  Oh, yeah.  We eat a lot of limb rats.  Limb rats are good.  They eat a lot of acorns.  That's sweet meat.  Limb rats.  Limb rats.  Squirrels good eating?  Oh, you guys have got to come out of here for a fall.  A fall spirit of the wild orgy with Uncle Ted.  I will feed you food that is the finest tasting, healthiest food on the planet.  And squirrels are some of the best because that's all they eat is acorns.  So their flesh is real sweet.  It's like the ultimate kosher kosher, you know. 
[02:35:00]  How do you prepare a squirrel?  You kill it and you add fire.  You're not talking any fancy sauces here.  You can if you want to.  You know, I got all kinds of marinades.  I'm like the master.  I'm like God of marinade, man.  I'll put some slop together in the kitchen.  You don't want to just get a radiator hose and suck it up.  It's like apple cider vinegar and brown sugar and olive oil and garlic pepper and garlic salt.  Oh, my God.  And a little bit of French dressing.  You whip that all up with like an egg beater and just whip it up until it foams. 
[02:35:30]  And you lay that squirrel ass down in that glass pan overnight and soak up all that good stuff.  And you put it on the fire in the morning.  I'm telling you, it's like sex with a singe.  You know, we got to confess something to you.  There was a time we invited a couple of chefs in here and they cooked up rat.  Rat's good.  And surprisingly, well, we were.  I don't know about New York City rat, but I eat muskrat.  No, no, no, no.  These rats came from the subways.  We killed them.  We had two cooks and we had a French chef in here and he made the rat taste good. 
[02:36:00]  He made a rat au plov.  Enough garlic and butter.  You'd be surprised what you'd eat.  It was such a bummer because we did this bit hoping that they were going to eat the rat and, you know, start puking.  And these people started going back for seconds.  Well, it probably tasted good.  I'm just not so sure of the quality of the flesh of a New York City rat, some of the crap they eat there.  You know, like the pigeons in New York, the pigeons in Chicago.  I catch them.  When I go to Chicago and perform every year, I'm going back the next week.  And I have this little ritual.  I take my kids out on the street of Chicago. 
[02:36:30]  I've never done it in Manhattan, but I've come real close.  And I actually catch these pigeons alive.  And when people beg for food, I smack the pigeon's head on the railing somewhere and give them the damn pigeon if they want food.  But I was told by some of my cop buddies in Chicago that these pigeons from the inner city are all toxic because they eat all that nasty, toxic stuff.  Yeah.  So I don't eat that.  Did you ever eat an animal that you thought was just awful and you'd never eat it again?  No.  Well, I eat, you know, mountain lion, black bear in Africa, the actual lion steaks. 
[02:37:00]  The native Africans that I hunt with, they consider the lion to be a sacred beast.  And when they kill it, they use all the body fluids and all the phlegm from the carcass as medicine.  And the old people over there don't have any arthritis or any sore bones or joints because the phlegm from the lion carcass,  they actually rub it like a lotion and it's just an amazing, amazing lifestyle.  I do my damnedest to live that over here, you know.  That's insane.  It is awesome.  Well, it's so alien, though. 
[02:37:30]  No, it's alien in Manhattan, but the rest of the world gets along just fine with it.  I like this.  You've got a couple of, I guess, pheasant in your hand here in this picture.  And it says, Gonzo is your dog and Ted, cocks in hand.  Cox in hand, baby.  That's what it is.  He's got two.  I'm big on cocks.  You like hunting the cocks?  I like stalking the ever-elusive cocks.  You know, you guys redefine debauchery.  We try.  You know what?  This is almost like a Broadway show on acid.  Yeah.  You ever been hunting and seen one cock and said, well, there's a bigger cock? 
[02:38:00]  That's the one I really want.  No, but it sounds good coming from you.  Right.  Hey, now the book looks great, Ted, but I have a problem.  I bet you do.  I can help you.  Where the hell am I going to find antelope so I can try the sweet and sour recipe?  Well, you know, within 20 minutes of downtown Manhattan, you guys got so many damn deer over there in Westchester.  Over in New Jersey, you got more black bear than in recorded history right across the damn river.  And in New Jersey, you got more damn deer. 
[02:38:30]  There are more Canadian geese in America, particularly right in New Jersey, than there's ever been in recorded history.  So I'd say, get yourself a damn gun and get to work, boy.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  In fact, I'm coming to New Jersey.  When we toured with Kiss, I got to be pretty good friends with the cat boy.  And he wants me to come to his place and kill the damn deer and geese because they're destroying his garden.  You're the guy to do it.  Yeah, I'm just the man.  I'm available between September and February.  That's all I do is kill stuff.  What do you do when you...  Do you ever go to restaurants? 
[02:39:00]  What do you eat when you're not, like, when you're away?  Well, typically, you know, I started at Ted Nugent United Sportsman of America about 14 years ago.  And I got my blood brothers in every nook and cranny of this great American experiment here.  And they've got a barbecue going whenever they hear that I'm on tour.  I'll be doing about 150 concerts this year.  And everywhere I go, even when we...  We just got back from Sweden and Great Britain.  And even over in London, these damn Nugent TNUSA members,  they actually had some red stag steaks that they brought down.  And they had a little hibachi back behind the concert. 
[02:39:30]  They were cooking me up with some flesh.  It was really kind of cute.  But I've got blood brothers everywhere.  Somebody's got something dead for Uncle Ted, no matter where I am.  Really?  Can you talk about the roadkill barbecues that some of these places have?  Well, I don't know how anybody else does it.  But we've seen, you know, there's so many damn deer.  In fact, there's more mountain lions.  But it's more than that.  I used to live upstate New York.  They're everywhere.  And they would, I don't know, when a car hits like these animals,  they kind of throw them in a freezer.  And one, I don't know, once a year, they get these huge barbecues together. 
[02:40:00]  And they cook up all these animals that were hit by cars.  Well, with the Ted Dugy United Sportsmen of America  and a bunch of the NRA organizations, the Safari Club International,  we've got the Hunters for the Hungry and the Farmers Feeding the Homeless.  And in just the last few years, these hunting organizations have fed over 10 million meals of venison  with the Salvation Army and various soup kitchens and homeless shelters.  And there is a surplus out there.  There's not a place in America that doesn't have too many deer. 
[02:40:30]  So we need to start killing more of them and using better.  And these different organizations, including roadkills, because a lot of places,  you remember old Cuomo, the old Governor Cuomo,  he made it illegal to use roadkills in the state of New York,  which is why we got Pataki.  And we sent Cuomo on his eternal nacho date with Ann Richards  because this is a resource.  If you get that roadkill in time, that's some good food.  It beats the hell out of any burger you're going to find in any restaurant. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, people are starving, and there's plenty of deer walking around.  Yeah, I remember I had a conversation with the old Governor Cuomo,  and he was telling me how it had to be USDA-approved  before people could eat venison or wild game.  Meanwhile, the homeless people were scraping garbage out of dumpsters,  and I made sure that Mario understood that.  And we passed the law when Pataki became governor  because he had a bitter sense of reality, and we're real proud of that.  That's cool.  Hey, I want to hear Mike over here on the national line. 
[02:41:30]  Ted, you want to hear somebody?  He wants to fire off his .68 caliber.  There's such a thing as a .68 caliber?  I don't know.  I think there is not.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  What do you got?  I got a Spider Custom-built.  Spider Custom-built?  Yeah.  And what is this?  It's a paintball gun.  Oh, stop it.  I'm trying to be cute.  Yeah, a wussy, wussy.  What are you, a Courtney Love fan?  Get rid of that crap.  I'm putting up on him.  Paintball.  What do you got, a bunch of wussies there?  I thought this was a man's radio show.  I know.  We'll try to redeem ourselves with Dave.  Dave.  Dave, what's up?  What do you got, Dave? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, what do you want, man?  I got a .243, .30-odd, .6, .22, .250.  I got three ARs.  I got a model Uzi, .44, 12-gauge.  I got the Uzi in the AR loaded up.  All right.  Fire off the Uzi.  All right.  Here you go.  Let me step outside.  I love your fans, man.  That'd be great.  You're my fans.  All right, let's hear.  Here we go.  Nine millimeters.  It's going down.  Take the safety off.  No, no. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, nine millimeters.  That'll do.  That'll do.  That'll do.  That's kind of a girl's round, but it'll be better.  You want the Uzi?  The AR?  Yeah, let's hear the AR.  AR, 223.  That's got a little bit more horsepower.  My neighbor just pulled up across the street.  He's probably flipping out right now.  All right.  Here we go.  That's what you get for having neighbors.  Let's get down.  Oh, wait a minute.  We got a jam.  We got a jam.  Oh, you got a jam.  Yeah.  You got to clean the jam gun, Dave. 
[02:43:00]  Get some inhibitor.  We got this inhibitor on.  All right.  You ready?  Gun clean and solvent out there, man.  All right.  Go, Dave.  Yeah.  See, 223 is better, man.  That sounds much better.  I like a 223.  That's good, Dave.  I love you, son.  Thanks a lot, Dave.  Take a deep breath and suck in all that ballistic sexuality there.  That sounds great.  God, I love that.  That stuff smells great.  It's like a Broadway show on acid, man.  Ted, you got to shoot something off, Rob.  Yeah, Ted, could you shoot something? 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Rock, are you downstairs?  You down there?  Okay.  You guys, no.  Give me just a second.  I'll run downstairs.  All right, man.  Rip me.  Hang on now.  Hell yeah.  We'll plug the book while you're going downstairs.  Hang on.  Plug the hell away.  We're talking to Ted Nugent.  His new book is called Kill It and Grill It.  He's going downstairs to shoot off some guns for us today, man.  The Guide to Preparing and Cooking Wild Game and Fish.  There you go.  It includes recipes for deer, elk, wild boar, rabbit, bear, wild turkey, duck, and more.  And his very attractive wife. 
[02:44:00]  See, I don't have to worry about no damn neighbors.  I ain't got no damn neighbors.  Hey, Ted, I got to ask you something.  Shut them all.  Yeah.  Are you aware that they're trying to get you to do a radio show here?  Yeah.  I got requests from all over the damn country to do a real radio because I'm a funny son  of a bitch.  People want to have fun with me.  But here you go.  Now, you heard that.  I want the people in New York to listen.  One guy shot off that.  He actually dared to call offering a paint gun.  I mean, kiss my ass.  You know what I mean?  All right.  What do you got?  That one guy shot off a nine millimeter Uzi.  That's a semi-automatic Uzi.  That's kind of cute.  We got a couple of those. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  And Mrs. Nugent's got one of those in her purse.  And then the ER-15, that's cute.  We got 16 of those here.  Yeah.  But the Navy SEALs come out here a lot.  And I'm looking out over 2,000 acres of nothing short of a sacred, sacred swamp.  And I've got a Glock 10 millimeter here.  Yeah.  And I'm just standing on my deck.  I'm looking at a beautiful lake.  And I actually see where the bluegills are bedding.  So I'll try to kill some fish while I'm doing this.  All right?  All right.  And I'm putting the phone on my left ear.  You guys ready?  Ready.  Glock 10 millimeter using Corbon 135 grain 10 millimeter loads doing 1,500 feet a second. 
[02:45:00]  You ready?  All right.  This is how we handle carjackers in Detroit.  Ready?  Here goes Uncle Ted 10 millimeter man's gun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Now, that had a little bit more depth to it, didn't it?  It certainly did.  I think I killed about 20 car people.  Son, go fetch. 
[02:45:30]  Go get a rake and bring in some slabs.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And since I shot that, I've already put in a fresh magazine just in case.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Isn't that beautiful?  That sounded great.  No, it's a great kind.  It's got much more horsepower.  These 10 millimeters are so much better than the 9 millimeter, man.  Yeah?  Evan Marshall started this law enforcement test group where he's studied over, I think it's up to a half a million shootings now.  You know, with the big Crips and Bloods party out there, you know? 
[02:46:00]  The crack dealers like to shoot each other, which I'd like to just drop them some ammo.  But he's studied all these shootings, and he's discovered that this gun on my belt right now is the number one rated one-shot stopper.  In other words, a carjacker comes.  You don't have to double tap.  You just shoot them once, and it's all over.  You call 911 and have them bring a broom and a dustpan.  Nice.  Water.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  What else you got there, man?  You got anything a little louder? 
[02:46:30]  Oh, you got the .22-250, but we don't need to be shooting that off of the Manhattan foes, do we?  I would love it.  That's just a big varmint gun.  You know, it's no more fun than the Glock.  The Glock is more fun.  It has a better phone tone, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  I just want to hear some artillery.  I hear something a little bigger.  All right.  You want to hear .22-250?  Yeah.  That has to be handy right here.  All right, let's give it a listen.  This is a Remington Model 722-250. 
[02:47:00]  It's got a Leupold 6x20 scope, just in case there's a scumball way out there, you know?  Right.  It just shoots a little .55 grain bone.  You hear that?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That's beautiful.  It's almost as good as my guitar.  That's great.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  Now, there are a couple deer across the lake, but it ain't seasoned,  so I'm not going to shoot them.  I'll just spook them a little bit.  You ready?  Yeah.  22-250.  Vermint load.  Real good for carjackers. 
[02:47:30]  It kind of goes in like a thumb, comes out like a Frisbee.  You ready?  Hey, man.  Let's do it.  Here you go.  Ready?  Now, shut up.  Here it is.  How's that?  That's beautiful.  It goes in like a thumb and comes out like a Frisbee.  It goes in like a thumb, comes out like a Frisbee.  You can actually talk to your gut pile while you're fading away.  You can actually fondle your pancreas in the last moments of your life. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, man.  That is beautiful, Ted.  Yeah, it is.  I'm a beautiful man.  Absolutely.  You're all right, man.  Ted Nugent.  Don't be a stranger.  We love it.  Hey, we're coming back.  You know, we're touring all summer like idiots.  And Kill It and Grill It is available at tednugent.com.  And I should be doing a book sign in Manhattan out there sometime.  My brother still lives there.  We like to come there and scare people.  Hey, Ted, I want to take a vacation and go out there and check your place out.  This is heaven.  We live in heaven.  My son, we catch bluegills every day.  We kill some big turkeys this spring.  We just got back from Europe. 
[02:48:30]  We're going back to Africa.  We live.  The American dream, you don't even dare dream in these dimensions.  Our life is so cool, it's just insane.  That's great, man.  Yeah, it is.  We're very, very lucky.  I thank God every day.  And I thank you guys, too.  Thank you, Ted Nugent.  Are you still touring with kids?  No, no.  Do you mean opening for the cartoons?  No, not me.  No, we're just touring ourselves this year.  I got Marco Mendoza.  I got a brand new CD on Spitfire coming out.  Best damn dangerous rhythm and blues I've ever created.  Marco Mendoza, Tommy Clefetto is two of the most gifted virtuosos a guy could ever jam with, man. 
[02:49:00]  I'm a lucky, lucky man.  Cool, Ted.  Kill it and grill it.  All right, guys.  Pick it up, man.  Live it up, man.  Thank you, Ted.  Adios.  There you go.  Ted Nugent.  Ted Nugent.  How cool is that?  Ted firing off some of his stuff for us.  He's just great.  And he just knows everything about his guns, the game he shoots, the loads he's using in the guns.  Very educated guy.  That's amazing. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, I love watching him argue.  I mean, there's points on both sides, but I just love watching him run right through people with their stupid emotional guns kill.  And he's watching them run over him with a great argument.  He just go, yes, they do.  Well.  I guess that ends our shooting bit.  That was pretty good.  Although, if somebody can...  Ted Nugent's shooting.  If someone can conjure up some automatic weapons, we're always willing to listen to those.  All right.  Ted shooting them.  Now, that's celebrity gunfire right there.  Some celebrity gunfire. 
[02:50:00]  That was nice.  Now, we need a bigger celebrity with bigger guns.  Ooh.  It ain't gonna happen.  No.  And we'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Friends of the Opie and Anthony Show stay at the Park Central New York here in Midtown Manhattan.  Call 1-800-346-1359.  The new summer rates now through September 3rd with rates from $169. </pre>
