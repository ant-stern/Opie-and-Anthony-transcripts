<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed here covers their one-year anniversary/Halloween party at a Times Square Hard Rock Cafe.  The show was split between a main studio segment and a remote broadcast from the party itself.

The studio portion featured a vulgar game where a female guest, "Patty" (later identified as Stalker Patty, a Maury Povich show guest), won $770 by having whipped cream-covered cherries thrown at her buttocks.  This segment was filled with sexually explicit descriptions and crude jokes.  Other guests in the studio included  "Donkey Sausage" (identified as Jim Norton's girlfriend),  various members of the show's production team (Ben, Steve, Travis, Nathaniel, Derek, and Danny), and  "Pat from Budachi," a frequent loser in eating contests.  The segment concluded with a Live Wire (AC/DC tribute) performance punctuated by repeated shouts of "Daddy."  The hosts' commentary throughout was heavily laden with profanity and offensive remarks, including a reference to Howard Stern's move to Sirius.

The remote broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe was hosted by Ron and Fez.  Fez was dressed as Faye Wray from *King Kong*.  They provided commentary on the party,  describing the costumes of attendees like “Winnie” (in a revealing outfit) and “Too Cute” (dressed as Teela from He-Man).  They also noted the absence of the scheduled Rush and AC/DC tribute bands, causing unrest amongst the crowd.  The remote segment featured numerous guests, including Hard Rock Johnny (a Hard Rock Cafe representative), Rich Voss, Bonnie Voss, Bill Burr, Patrice O'Neal, Big Kev, Bob Kelly, Laszlo, Master Poe, and Swiss Miss (a “Bonne Bing girl” and dancer).  The hosts’ commentary consisted largely of offensive jokes and banter, including references to JonBenét Ramsey.  The remote concluded with the arrival of Opie and Anthony and the eventual performance of a Rush tribute band, 2112.

The overall broadcast from the Hard Rock Cafe also included live performances by three tribute bands: 2112 (Rush), Live Wire (AC/DC), and 2U (U2), with Brother Joe serving as the frontman for the U2 tribute.  A $500 costume contest was held.  The broadcast was consistently characterized by vulgar and sexually explicit language, discussions about drug use, and numerous off-color comments about the partygoers and the event itself.  A significant portion focused on sexually explicit details regarding a segment involving Stalker Patty and the cherry dart game.  The broadcast culminated with a final remark about the show after the musical performances.

[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Live from the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square. 
[00:03:30]  Featuring Opie.  We're all fucked.  Anthony.  God, man, that is just oof.  Well, Jimmy Norton.  I want to take a dump in her eyeball.  Hurricane Ben.  Hey, it's Ross.  Call me hash, stupid.  E-Rock.  He's getting man-to-man massages.  And Martini C.  I don't know what happens to you.  I don't know what happens to the internet.  With live performances by 2U, Live Wire, and 2112.  Well, there's always room for improvement.  Shut the fuck up.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  All right. 
[00:04:00]  We are live, Fezzy, high above Times Square, high above the Hard Rock, looking down on the Opie and Anthony anniversary party.  The anniversary party, Halloween party, live at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Ronnie, can you feel the electricity in the air?  Even this far off, Fezzy, looking down, which has got to be about seven, eight stories above the action right now. 
[00:04:30]  I can see the people milling around.  There is excitement.  You can feel it here tonight.  It's a virtual who's who.  When I saw Sandy Cain and Twotto on the red carpet tonight, I knew it was going to be a special evening.  I asked her what she was wearing.  She just said funk.  Maybe that's our role here tonight is find out what people are wearing.  I asked Twotto what he was wearing.  He said Sandy Cain.  Oh, that's kind of gross.  When you think about it, Fez, it's a little bit gross.  But it is Halloween.  Oh, what a night in store.  The people are just filing in now. 
[00:05:00]  I can look down and see them.  Limos lining up one after another.  And we are waiting still for the limo to arrive.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton coming to the Hard Rock Cafe for the one-year anniversary slash Halloween party.  Now, the entertainment that they've got lined up, Fezzy, stellar.  Coming on first is going to be 2112.  That is the Rush Tribute Band.  Right.  If we can convince them to do trees, I'm going to be very excited.  It'll make my whole night.  I'll go crazy.  Also, coming up after that, Live Wire, the ACDC Tribute Band. 
[00:05:30]  Uh-huh.  And then wrapping up the show, your headliner tonight, it's to you, Brother Joe's U2 Tribute Band.  And Fezzy, look who's just walking up.  He just got out of his limousine.  It's Brother Joe.  How are you, Joe?  All right.  Let's get Joe's mic turned on.  All right.  There we go, Danny.  There we go.  Thanks, Danny.  Yes, my limo, plush and opulently appointed, I might add voice.  You know what?  You look great tonight, Edge.  When I came down Broadway and saw you up on lights there, my friend, it's a nice thing. 
[00:06:00]  You know, that was rather impressive for me to see myself.  Right.  I was impressed with me.  Now, I look at the lineup we have.  I have no American music whatsoever.  We just turn our back on the United States.  Oh, look at this.  Walking into an ambush.  The first time I'm walking into an ambush not on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's Canada, it's Australia, it's Ireland.  Nothing here?  Nothing American, my friend.  Oh, the Union Jack will be flying high tonight on Halloween. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, man.  Lucky that we didn't get a hurricane, as it were.  You guys got a couple gigs coming up, too, in the next couple weeks, right?  Ah, yeah.  Yeah, but they're out of town.  Yeah.  Well, you know where you are on satellite radio.  We're nationwide.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  I almost forgot.  So, coming up this next weekend, November 4th, you're going to be at the Ritz on Main in Holland, PA?  Ritz on Main in Holland, PA, absolutely.  You know more about my schedule than I do, Fezzy.  You know, I do my homework, my friend.  I was in Holland.  I put my finger in the dike there. 
[00:07:00]  Really?  Yeah, a whole different time in Holland.  Oh, was she furious?  Yeah, she was mad.  We could have represented Holland with an aha tribute.  It would have been nice.  There you go.  Take on me.  When that kid was stuck in the comic book, forget about it.  I was all tears.  I was all tears.  I didn't know that's how you got out of a comic book.  You just slam into the sides there, the panels.  I just had my own schedule handed to me to read off.  Nice.  November 4th, Ritz on Main, the 5th, Berks Bar in Yonkers.  If you haven't been there, you should go. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, go.  Okay.  Absolutely.  It's a bring-a-gun-from-home night.  It should be a lot of fun.  If you haven't been there, you probably don't know exactly where it's at, get directions.  Borderline Yonkers Bronx, if you know what I mean, yo.  And, yeah, we're all over the place, though, guys.  And then Ned Devine's on the 11th in Herndon, Virginia.  In Herndon.  All right.  Now, I mean, you're playing up here.  Look at the size of the stage.  You don't often get to play.  This is an outstanding stage.  Well, you know, I mean, this was, at one point, this was, what was it? 
[00:08:00]  The Paramount.  The Paramount, yeah.  Which is a legendary room.  Yeah, the Paramount Theater, where we're doing this from tonight, that's what the Hard Rock  in Times Square.  Now, Hard Rock was on 57th Street for probably 20 years.  We had some good parties there, too, if you remember.  Yeah, just gigantic parties.  But they moved down into Times Square.  At one time, this was WWE.  And then before that, it was the Paramount, where Frank Sinatra performed.  Oh, my God.  Martin and Lewis, and all the big jazz things. 
[00:08:30]  So, I mean, for you, does that work?  Is it a good feeling of walking on the stage?  It's a, you know, you walk in, and you can just smell the funk.  Right.  It's amazing.  I thought that was the chicken tenders.  You can actually feel the history in this room.  See, I only go as far back as the WWE restaurant.  I remember this one, it was all title belts and robes.  Yeah, well, and then remember, ONA did that stupid, what was the football game?  Oh, the XFL.  Holy shit, that was this room?  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  That was here.  I knew I recognized this one.  So, there's a lot of good luck attached to this.  Yeah.  This room is a good luck charm.  Yeah.  This room is used to near riots.  It was the only TV show that I watched, and I went, holy shit, this is getting out of control.  It's not going to work out.  It was a TV show, you couldn't use a wide shot because everybody had their finger up.  Right.  Just not trying to help.  They like the guys, but in no way want to help.  They were pests long before they picked up the names.  Yeah, that's true.  Finally, they got a name for it.  I'm watching people following in now. 
[00:09:30]  You guys are going on last, right?  Yes, as always.  Now, is that because you two is a bigger group than these, or?  No, that's because I'm a selfish fuck, and I want to do more songs than them.  Nice.  Way to go with it.  And you put this together, getting the other tribute bands, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I work with a lot of the tribute bands locally and on a regional level.  So, 2112, the best of the Rush tributes?  Absolute best.  There are no better.  You will think that you're listening to Rush live.  Is that right?  Yeah, yeah.  Anthony's an amazing singer. 
[00:10:00]  Anthony, he's a singer from 2112.  Actually, Anthony Lucchese.  Yeah.  His name is Anthony Lucchese.  No, the little Asian guy playing bass.  Who's he?  Oh, that's Geddy Reed.  Oh, Geddy Reed, baby.  We like to call him.  That's Jack.  Jack is a hell of a bass player.  Just like he should have played violin.  Like, well, that's kind of stereotyping, isn't it?  He should have played violin, but he picked up a bass and just took to it.  He should be in a Mo-Yo-Ya.  What was that?  Yo-Yo Ma.  That's his name.  Yo-Yo Mo-Mo-Ya.  A Yo-Yo Ma trivia band. 
[00:10:30]  And boom goes a dynamite.  Sorry, I've had a bit to drink.  Oh, it's not.  It's Anthony Paul on vocals and programs.  Like, that's his real last name.  Right.  Oh, we'll take it, though.  I know it's bad.  Les Paul.  Wonderful guitar player.  Oh.  Just fabulous.  Absolutely.  Absolutely killer.  So it should be a fun night all the way around.  Oh, yeah.  Second band is amazing as well.  Live Wire, they just tear it up with ACDC, man.  This guy does Bon Scott and Brian Johnson. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, he does them both?  Does them both.  Which ACDC doesn't even do?  So that's even better.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  Twice the treat here tonight.  Well, uh...  We're filing in.  You know, not only are they filing in, but we're up high here, and I see that the pests  are climbing.  They are now climbing.  Like that old Billy Idol video.  Yeah, that's scary.  It really is a dancing with myself feeling.  It's not going to...  You know, right now, let's enjoy it before everyone gets too drunk and too rowdy. 
[00:11:30]  You know, Ronnie, I do see more women this time around than I've seen at past roadshows.  I know, it stinks.  And you always got to worry about that, because with Fez, you get a sausage party.  But, you know, I'm looking around, and it's really not too bad on women here tonight.  It's looking pretty promising.  Hopefully, you'll even out.  We are live, Fezzy, at the Hard Rock in the middle of Times Square. 
[00:12:00]  Opie and Anthony doing the one-year anniversary.  It's Ron and Fez.  We're going to be hosting the radio part of this one tonight.  Now, we talked about all these great bands are coming on stage.  Opie and Anthony are going to be on stage and doing a costume contest, among other stuff.  So, occasionally, when not needed, we'll take over.  And if not, it'll be Opie and Anthony on stage.  Right.  We'll throw it to the stage.  We'll throw it to the bands.  The costume contest, $500 first prize plus an XM MiFi going to the grand prize winner tonight. 
[00:12:30]  What's second prize, Fez?  Second prize is $300 plus an XM MiFi.  And third place, $100 plus the MiFi.  So, you've got this whole thing down.  You've got little cards up front of you, too.  Oh, yeah.  Exactly.  And, of course, tonight is my salute to old Hollywood in my costume.  Who are you dressed as tonight?  I'm trying to figure it out.  You probably don't recognize me.  I'm Faye Ray.  Oh, I see.  Faye Ray from the original King Kong.  So, it's a salute to old Hollywood tonight. 
[00:13:00]  If I would have had to guess, I thought you were going as Fat Girl in a Tight Dress, but Faye Ray.  With a wig, it looks a little Linda Trippish.  Yeah.  But it's Faye Ray from King Kong.  I did start to think that I was tripping for a while.  Hey, of all the gorgeous waitresses, look at this bunch trying to hand this potato skits.  Not as attractive as we want.  No, we have a ball-headed Armenian actually serving us food tonight.  Brother Joe, what time are you guys scheduled to go on stage? 
[00:13:30]  We're scheduled to start at 10.  10 o'clock.  Yeah, we're starting at about 10 o'clock.  So, if these guys run late.  I run a tight ship, my friend.  I run a tight ship.  Okay.  Absolutely.  Well, be careful.  Army training did for me.  Once your brother gets up there and starts to stretch a little bit.  Once he starts babbling.  If he starts babbling like he was the other night in Disney, it's all over.  Yeah.  I'm expecting to do a half a minute.  You know, I've seen people walking by, you know, as we're watching the red carpet.  I see Big A come by, Fezzy, looking like a million bucks. 
[00:14:00]  Also, stalker Patty walked by.  And now look who's walking up, Fezzy, from the Hard Rock itself.  It's Hard Rock Johnny.  Hard Rock Johnny making the scene here tonight, who's done a terrific job putting this together for us.  How are you, Johnny?  We've got a couple different mics there, too.  Johnny, nice to see you.  Thanks for having us all here from XM.  Johnny!  No problem.  Hello, boys.  Johnny, what's the latest, buddy? 
[00:14:30]  Wow, someone just handed Fez a giant sucker.  Yeah, just got a giant chupa pop.  Very nice.  Thank you.  From a very strange looking clown.  From a scary clown from the Rob Zombie movies.  Fez will actually be using this later as a fisting device.  Feel the size of this thing.  Wow, like that was a rock.  I saw that weird clown out front.  I have no idea who he was.  But he was standing on Broadway doing that act.  We'll have to try and talk to him a little later on.  It is Ron and Fez.  We are live from the Hard Rock. 
[00:15:00]  It's the one-year anniversary for ONA.  Johnny, we were just talking.  This used to be the old Paramount Theater.  The Paramount Theater was housed in this building.  The actual stage was to our right.  And that's the stage, though, where Sinatra played.  The Beatles played a concert here.  Elvis' first movie was premiered here.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, so there's a lot of musical history in the building.  And for us, it was kind of a natural fit.  And now ONA.  So really, it confirms... 
[00:15:30]  Look, come on.  ...come full circle.  I also want to talk to you about this.  20 years, at least, the Hard Rock was on 57th Street, right?  22, actually.  22 years.  22 years.  Did you get all the guitars moved?  Yes.  And, you know, you're in a situation where everybody knows where the Hard Rock was.  And then you moved.  It had to be a little bit of a scary move.  Even though Times Square cooled, but you had to be a little worried about it.  It was kind of cool.  The way it all went down is we actually closed on Thursday night on 57th Street 
[00:16:00]  and opened Friday morning here.  And overnight, they actually took down every sign that was on the building, the Cadillac.  Everything was gone.  You'd never know that there was a Hard Rock there.  I was up there that morning waiting to come down here in the back of an armored car with little Stephen,  which is a whole other story for another day.  And there was nothing in the building.  It was almost empty already.  If I was out on that street, I'd call the comps.  Say there's been a robbery.  Someone stole a Cadillac. 
[00:16:30]  I know it does seem weird.  What happened with the Cadillac?  It's down in our warehouse now with a lot of other stuff.  It's just down there waiting for another home.  How much stuff is in Johnny's garage?  Yeah, right.  I got a couple of guitars.  Every once in a while, you know, he'll just say to himself,  hey, I'm going to try on Pete Townsend's pants.  Just, you know, it's late at night.  You know, the rules, we have this memorabilia warehouse in Orlando.  And the rules are, you know, don't break it.  So you can try on clothes.  That's a good rule.  The first thing I do, I'm like, I'm looking for John Popper stuff, 
[00:17:00]  because that's about the only guy I can fit into.  See if you can find something from Mama Cass.  I knew you were going to come with a Mama Cass reference.  Well, it is Halloween.  I try to do it every year.  He got in trouble for finishing the rest of the sandwich.  That sandwich was worth big money.  That was a collector's item.  That was collectible pork.  We are live right now.  It's ONA's first year anniversary, Halloween night here in Times Square in New York.  And Halloween, already a crazy night in New York to begin with, right? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  And with this crowd, just looking around, it's like 10 minutes we're open.  And already I'm feeling a little nervous.  I don't know about you guys, I'm feeling a little nervous.  We're up about nine floors above everything, Fezzy, looking down on the stage.  Beautiful view.  Great.  We were talking about this with Brother Joe.  Gigantic concert stage.  Just a couple days ago, you had a big show, right?  Yeah, yesterday we had Bon Jovi here.  And that was just an incredible show.  A little acoustic thing.  The night before that, or I'm sorry, two nights before, then on Friday, little Steven did five bands here. 
[00:18:00]  And then, of course, you guys were at our grand opening where they had Velvet Revolver.  Which was a great show.  They were unbelievable.  That was excellent.  In this small space, it was just unbelievable.  Now, you are basically sitting right under where it drops for New Year's Eve.  The ball drops almost on top of the hard rock.  Yep.  New Year's Eve has got it.  I mean, how do you guys even prepare for something like that?  Well, we're going to, it's a weird thing because you have, oh, I see the boys. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  It's all coming together.  Opie and Anthony now are entering the building.  Look at the entourage.  They're ranking them.  They have arrived.  It really, it does have a Jay-Z feel to them.  The, uh, so New Year's Eve is kind of an R. Kelly.  In a bad way.  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, in a bad way.  I don't condone.  Yeah, no.  Although, I noticed you're not allowed to have any trick-or-deaders over.  Exactly.  I'm supposed to be at a meeting in Jersey right now at the probation officer's place. 
[00:19:00]  Did you get the facts that said you're not allowed to paint your balls like jack-o-lanterns like you did last year?  I paint them like little dum-dum drops.  Just help yourself, kids.  It's a little lollipop.  Help yourself, boys.  It's all going to be fun.  This one's pineapple.  What?  I thought it was fish.  Anyway, Johnny, what do you have planned for New Year's Eve?  What's going down?  Believe it or not, it's still kind of up in the air as to what we're going to do.  We're looking for some partners. 
[00:19:30]  We've got a couple things working.  Last year, we weren't open yet, but we still managed to have a live television show from our marquee out front.  So, we've got a couple things coming on.  I'm sure we'll get it out there once we're ready to go.  All right, cool.  Well, Johnny, thanks so much for having us in here tonight.  Nothing better than the hard rock in New York City.  It's an absolute pleasure to have you guys here as part of this great event, and maybe a year down the road.  Who knows?  Maybe we'll be back.  We'll flip it around. 
[00:20:00]  You guys will be out there.  The Ron and Fez one-year Labor Day party.  That's what we're after.  We're at, you know, we really want to pick out whatever doesn't make any sense at all for us.  If we're here for a year, Fez, you'll get $100.  That's true.  Because that would be a record for us.  O&A, one-year anniversary tonight.  Putting together a party, and what a party it is, Fez.  Three bands and a big costume contest.  The costume contest will be coming up a little bit later with a $500 grand prize plus an XM MiFi. 
[00:20:30]  And in just a little bit, we'll be kicking it off with the tribute bands.  First up will be 2112, the Rush tribute band, followed by Live Wire, ACDC tribute band.  And then wrapping everything up tonight with 2U, the U2 tribute band featuring Brother Joe.  Now, whenever O&A take the stage or whenever any of the bands take the stage, we'll immediately throw it over there,  let you pick it up, find out what the live feel here is in New York City. 
[00:21:00]  A million people in a parade downtown tonight for Halloween, Fez.  Yeah, that's going on in the village.  They'll miss me, but they'll just have to get along without me this year.  Yeah, this is the one year you won't be showing up.  Apparently, that one is a tribute.  It's kind of a Mardi Gras, and it's a tribute to knowledge.  Yeah, a lot of jazz performers there, they're going to do a jazz funeral as part of the parade,  where they're just marching through the village.  A funeral for old New Orleans, and then a rebirth thing or something like that for new New Orleans.  So, I think Earl is leading that. 
[00:21:30]  He wouldn't show up and be with us tonight, but I think he will be downtown,  because he never misses a jazz funeral.  Exactly.  I saw him on TV today just checking out Rosa Parks at the Capitol building.  Come on over.  Look who it is, Fezzy.  It's Swiss Miss, our friend.  And look how she is dressed for us tonight.  Now, she is dressed like a little Dutch girl.  Let's get her a microphone and some headphones.  How are you doing, Swiss Miss?  Good to see you.  We're on the air here.  And you look like a million bucks, honey. 
[00:22:00]  Like a million bucks.  Fezzy, Swissie has an exciting little announcement to make.  She did some acting today.  Tell Fez who you were with.  Just a little bit.  I was about a bing girl today.  She was about a bing girl?  I was dancing for James Gandolfini.  Congratulations.  Way to go.  Yes, yes, I'm on my way to stardom.  You really are.  I'm convinced, yeah.  Now, what happens?  How long do you have to dance like that on any given day? 
[00:22:30]  Well, the first time I did it, it was only about two or three hours.  But today, it was a solid six and a half hours.  Six and a half hours.  And what were you wearing?  Just a cheese string?  Just a cheese string.  Not panties, but a cheese string.  Not the Dutch girl outfit?  No.  This is Swiss, Fezzy.  Oh, of course.  Swiss myth, of course.  Fezzy, the stars are coming out tonight for ONA's one year anniversary.  It's one of the Bonne Bing girls, Swiss myth.  Who knew?  Anyone who's anyone is here.  This is true.  It's lovely to have you guys back. 
[00:23:00]  Well, you look like a million bucks.  Thank you.  Thank you so much for coming out tonight.  I've missed you guys.  It's great to see you.  Miss you too, honey.  All right.  Thank you.  It is Ron and Fez here hosting the ONA party.  Fezzy, one year anniversary.  And as we come up in just a little bit, the news will be starting.  And also, we're expecting ONA to take the stage.  That's right.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, they are all in the building as we speak.  They have arrived and we're getting ready to kick this party off in just a little bit.  I saw as their limo pulled up Fezzy, it looked like Club Soda Kenny had to come out shocking people to stay away from it. 
[00:23:30]  Club Soda Kenny, always ready on the taser.  Yeah, he is.  He tasers a little too much.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what you call a trick, not a treat.  Yeah, because we've got three waitresses down who, believe me, were doing nothing, and somebody put a taser up to their neck.  It was probably our waitress, too.  Yeah.  So now we're going to throw it on the potato skins.  And keeping it going with hot chicks.  Look at Solera.  Solera, what is your costume tonight? 
[00:24:00]  Let's grab a microphone.  Is that Bon Jovi?  Yeah.  A sexy Bon Jovi?  I'm a cowgirl.  Oh, a cowgirl.  I'm a cowgirl.  So it's a pair of cut-off shorts, kind of a halter top, and a cowboy hat.  Well, I would wear this anyway.  This was all in my closet.  You're not even trying.  I'm not.  You're basically not even trying.  It's just an excuse to look like a hold bag.  Again, but you look fabulous.  You could be a Bon Jovi girl yourself, and I mean that.  My tits don't have it in them. 
[00:24:30]  I bet they will by the end of the night.  Ouch.  Close, but yet so far.  Ron and Fez live.  It's the Opie and Anthony one-year anniversary.  Coming up on a break here.  And I believe when we get back from that, Fez, will be about the time where O&A will be taking  this stage and also listening to some music.  So, yeah.  Coming up first up will be 2112, the Rush Tribute Band.  That'll be coming up in just a little bit.  Ron and Fez live here at the Hard Rock Cafe for Opie and Anthony's one-year anniversary 
[00:25:00]  and Halloween party on XM202.  Hey, what's that?  Well, you've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock!  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock!  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket.  You can race it. 
[00:25:30]  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock!  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower,  making it the centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  It's a fucking rock, you dildo.  We leave you now with the sounds of Montana  and me making my face look like a glazed donut. 
[00:26:00]  Before I get back to my wife,  the sounds of the elusive bearded clan.  Me trying to shuck the hell out of that bearded clan.  I usually don't say things like that,  but I'll leave you this Sunday morning  with the sounds of me giving her the old pile drive.  That's the one where I crouch over her, 
[00:26:30]  push down real hard in a pile driving motion.  So now,  pictures and sounds of me  and the pile drive  on my mistress in Montana.  On the road,  the road I prefer,  pictures now of the Hershey Highway.  I visited that in Montana,  lots of the Hershey Highway.  My wife often thought I was fishing 
[00:27:00]  on my trips to Montana.  And it's true, I was.  Here's the sound of the  trouser trout  coming out of my trousers  as I pound some ass.  And now the sounds of me pounding ass  with my Montana crotch rat.  We leave you now.  The sounds of me and my mistress 
[00:27:30]  and me shooting a tray up in that piece.  And now, finally,  the sounds of my mistress  hobbing my knob.  We don't often leave you  with the sounds of knob-hobbing.  I figure this is a good time to leave.  And now the sounds of me  and my knob being hobbed.  Charles Kuralt on the road. 
[00:28:00]  Hob.  Knob.  That guy had some life going.  Who knew?  Probably more.  He was all over the country, right?  I don't know.  He was a mess, though.  Wasn't he?  He gave up like a million bucks  to that woman.  How was he picking up?  She had a million dollar gash.  How was he picking up chicks, though?  I know.  I don't know.  Look at my two bald heads. 
[00:28:30]  You might find one's more purple  than the other.  That's the fun one.  Now the sounds of  a purple helmet warrior  going into battle again  against the dreaded bearded clan.  Charles.  Charles, how's it going on?  Going on.  Yeah, he got himself a piece.  Montana crotch rat.  There's the Montana crotch rat. 
[00:29:00]  God, I wish she shaved.  A little personal hygiene  in the groin area.  So it wouldn't look so much  like a possum.  A woman looks like roadkill.  Looks like the last time I saw  a woodchuck caught in a combine.  All red and brown and whatnot.  Now the sounds of a woodchuck  being caught in a combine. 
[00:29:30]  Leave you.  All right.  Is Charles going to be hanging out  for the rest of the show, too?  I might have to go bang abroad.  You know me, on the road.  Looking for the dreaded  Montana crotch rat.  They didn't know anything  about shaving.  I mentioned she looks like  she had Einstein's head  in a leg lock.  She trimmed that. 
[00:30:00]  First time I made love to her.  Pulled those panties down  and looked like Fidel Castro  eating a London broil.  Now the sounds of Fidel Castro  eating a London broil.  I used to have a lot of sex  in my car.  Yes.  Gave her Spanish fly once.  I found her on the gear shift. 
[00:30:30]  Now the sounds of my girlfriend  on the gear shift.  We leave you.  Yes.  I just wish she was a little better  with the hygiene.  It sort of looked like  when you take two big pieces  of Silly Putty,  slap them together  and throw them in  on the floor of a barbershop.  Oh, pink and hairy. 
[00:31:00]  Not the sounds of Silly Putty.  I don't even know where to go  with this one.  Hey, it's Ron and Fez.  We are live back here  at ONA's one year anniversary.  And you see the folks 
[00:31:30]  who are just coming in.  We are high above the hard rock  right now, Fezzy.  About seven or eight stories high.  But they're bringing  some of the VIPs by  to say hi to us.  Look who it is.  It's the Panther boy.  Rich Voss is in the house.  Hey, Rich Voss.  My people.  Yeah.  I can hear them chanting  from even this far away.  Voss.  Voss.  Voss.  You know, here's the thing.  They're animals,  but they're the best animals 
[00:32:00]  you could ever meet.  ONA audience.  Right.  I haven't seen you guys  since I got that tattoo  on your show.  It has been a while.  Yeah.  What was it?  Never forget?  No, it was some flowers.  It was a gay thing.  Oh.  I got it.  It was going to be a tattoo  of a Rolls Royce,  but I ended up trying  to get one on eBay.  And you're married  since we saw you last time.  Yeah, my wife's in the back.  She has a career.  She's doing well.  She gets to sit with the VIP.  Yeah, that's a great idea.  You leave your wife with ONA.  That's always smart.  I'll buy that DVD  when it comes out.  Like she'll be back there 
[00:32:30]  when you get back.  Sold into slavery.  You know, I know it's Halloween.  The glow-in-the-dark teeth.  Nice touch.  You like that?  That is cool.  Yeah, it is.  It's nice.  Look at the size of those.  Scary is what it is.  Are some of the coolest  costumes here?  Yeah.  I saw somebody dressed  as a big black person.  I think it was Patrice.  Did you see that one?  Right, there was a Patrice look here, yeah.  There's some good costumes here.  I'll tell you,  ONA know how to throw a party, man.  This is like the old time.  How many NEW fans  do we have here?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  See?  One of them was Jeremy Coleman.  I know.  I'm telling you,  they know how to throw a party, ONA.  And you guys involved,  you can't get any better than this.  Well, we're high above.  We got the best seats in the house.  Yeah, this is going to be cool.  You know,  and the only thing about it  is a lot of times  when ONA throw a party,  we all get fired.  So I'm always really  in the back of my mind  going, you know,  saying to the wife,  hey, don't spend for that.  Yeah.  Just put that away.  Put that away  and see what happens.  We've got to give it  a couple days after the party.  Yeah,  and we'll see 
[00:33:30]  how everything works out.  You know,  it's a one-year anniversary party  for ONA.  What's nice is  that works,  the video company  that's running the video  of different ONA highlights  from the past year  on the video screens here.  Part of the highlights  we get to see  is Opie smashing  the letter  that Voss got  from the president  congratulating him  on his wedding.  It was unbelievable.  You know how upset I was?  And one,  not because it's mesh,  but because glass  was flying all over  the fucking studio.  I was hoping  it would take my eye out. 
[00:34:00]  So you wouldn't have  to see it.  Just get a big  XM payday out of that.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen,  the joy,  look at my eye.  I can't work.  Believe me,  I come from a long line  of a big family.  We all fall down at work  no matter what happens.  Boom.  A lot of workman's comp.  A lot of slip and falls  in the Bennington family.  Yeah,  I want to sue XM  to get an IOU.  What are you going to do?  Send me another MyFive?  Hey,  the future looks bright.  That's what they keep telling us.  What do you see next year? 
[00:34:30]  Nah,  this is cool,  man.  Everywhere we go on the road,  there's always some XM people  in the audience.  Cool.  From the websites  or the radio.  They're always fucking,  they're always the best audiences  on the road.  you and your wife  travel together now?  Is that the deal?  Well,  we do some gigs.  We're doing San Francisco  together and Jersey,  but we are,  you know,  she just had her HBO special.  She's got things going on.  Right.  I'm doing the clubs.  We'll see what happens,  you know.  No,  what do you do  when you're working  with your wife  and that town's girlfriend  shows up?  That's got to be a,  you know what I mean?  You've been on the road  a long time.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  You're wired  in every town in America.  The one in that port.  Here's the thing,  as long as I don't show up  with kids,  we're okay.  He's got a little,  really tan kids.  Let's see,  I'm in Evansville,  Indiana.  Hey,  Charlene,  how are you?  Give her a call.  Scary,  but true.  What are you going to do?  We all have a past,  right?  Some really bad.  I'm hoping to add  to mine tonight.  Well,  Fezzy,  all the VIPs 
[00:35:30]  are stopping by.  Look who it is  over here now.  It's,  it's Big A  has just entered.  Oh,  nice.  It's exciting to grab.  Grab that other mic.  Fez can stay with us.  Big A,  what are you,  nice to see it.  Put your headphones on.  Big A,  what are you dressed as  tonight?  Oh,  I'm dressed as  Patty.  Oh,  you're here as Patty.  Yeah.  Oh,  okay.  See,  he's got,  I could die of a chocolate bag. 
[00:36:00]  Good day,  but,  I never got to meet this guy.  Oh,  you never got to meet Big A?  This is Rich Voss.  How you doing,  sir?  Yeah.  It's all coming together  tonight,  yeah.  Have you ever gone out  and seen Rich perform,  Big A?  No,  I have not,  but I would love to  this weekend.  Yeah.  If you need to,  stay at his house  for a day or two.  His new wife won't mind.  Yeah.  No problem.  Big A,  is there anything 
[00:36:30]  you want to say  here tonight  on this Halloween?  We'd like to kill time.  Any well wishes  for O&A  on their one year anniversary?  Yeah,  that's what we could do.  Of course,  I'd like to wish  O&A,  the little Jimmy,  uh-huh,  the best  for the first year.  Uh-huh.  And also,  the person  who helped me  pick out  the costume  and gave me,  by dear,  his chest is ashes. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  All right,  good,  there you go.  Big A,  did you notice  with Fez's dress  that you've done  another costume change?  I did another  costume change  in my salute  to old Hollywood.  Right now,  I'm Betty Davis  in Whatever Happened  to Baby Jane?  That's a fantastic look  for you.  Yeah.  It's a parakeet meat.  Oh, yeah,  a lot of powder.  I'm going to let you  push me down the stairs  and I'll play  Joan Crawford.  I appreciate that.  I always love it  when couples  dress alike  for Halloween.  You know,  when I hear you guys  talk about role-playing, 
[00:37:30]  you know,  even though I'm not gay,  it's exciting.  That's hard to hear.  Hey,  did you notice  this hanging up  back here,  the big Quaalude,  the old-fashioned  Lemon 714  that they have  hanging up on stage?  God,  I remember doing  one of those  at the Pocono concert.  I was out for a weekend  just doing Quaaludes.  How great it was.  Well,  remember the Roarers,  were actually better  than the Lemons.  Well,  they were the original,  right?  The Roarers.  And the Lemons  were more of what  we used to call  a Spanish Quaalude  or a little bit  of a knockoff. 
[00:38:00]  What was good  is when you would  melt them down  and shoot them,  they would go  right into the system.  They really would.  It was really  the closest to heroin.  XM could have  a lood channel  with you, too.  24-hour lood talk.  Hey,  it's old junkie talk  with Lawson Bennington.  Do you remember  like windowpane  and blotter?  Sure.  Paper,  blotter acid?  Oh,  Jesus Christ.  On Halloween one year,  we did blotter  and we went to see  the New York Dolls  at the Waldorf Astoria.  Right.  And after we came out  after the show,  we couldn't find our car  and we went up to a cop 
[00:38:30]  and we go,  where's our car?  He goes,  it's impounded.  We thought he said  compounded  and we thought it was  like a little square  and we were just  tripping up.  That's what they do  when you're on acid.  Well,  we're going to dose  you tonight  just to see  whether you can  get through a show.  Now,  it's been a while.  It's been straight  for a long time,  right?  20 years.  I will say this.  Boss is the first person  I ever heard  the word crack from  back in the 80s.  Really?  Yeah.  He was the first person  I was working up  in Connecticut  with him. 
[00:39:00]  He's like,  get me to the train station.  I've got to get back  to the city  and cop crack.  I'm like,  crack,  what is this?  This is like  when you get to hear  crack or AIDS,  Boston will both of them.  And probably had both.  I'm telling you,  boy,  we had some great times  up in Harlem.  You're the only one  who ever says that.  You're with a really  fun comic.  I can't remember  his name right now.  Big guy  did impressions.  Bobby. 
[00:39:30]  Bobby Woods.  Bob Woods.  Bob Woods, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that night.  And he was as whack  as you.  And it's like,  really,  it's a different time.  But these guys  were just out of their minds.  And that was that  you could be as bad  as you possibly could  as you wanted to  on the road  during the 80s.  But there was so much  convenience we needed  because there was  a comedy club.  Every five feet  you could get away with it.  There was comics  that just died on stage  on the road back then.  There was a couple of them  just out, 
[00:40:00]  dead.  Get nailed over?  Just dead.  Just,  we lost them.  We lost them.  And you would just  hear about it all the time.  It was like being a race car  driver was.  Did you hear  so-and-so died?  Oh, I just worked  with them two weeks ago.  It's awful.  Ollie Joe Prater.  Ollie Joe Prater.  Zach.  Frank.  Bastille?  Yeah, Frank.  Bastille was great.  Well, you know what?  His father died.  And then he died  two days later.  So they didn't want  to have another funeral.  So they cremated  and put him in a bottle  and ashes  and they put it 
[00:40:30]  in his father's coffin  under the pillow.  So they buried  the father and him together.  Wow.  Now he's got to like  fucking destroy  his father in the afterlife.  That's a headrest.  He got buried  in the headrest.  Thank you very much.  Ron and Fez,  we are live here  waiting for Opie and Anthony  to come on stage  at the Hard Rock  in New York City.  Just walking back and forth  through Boston's  broad-town pass.  And it's kind of interesting  from time to time.  The Hard Rock  near a capacity here.  This is a great party  tonight for ONA. 
[00:41:00]  One year anniversary  plus, of course,  the Halloween celebration.  Moments away  from ONA  taking the stage.  And, of course,  21-12.  They'll be up first.  They're the Rush Tribute fans.  I'm looking around  to get a check  from somebody.  You know,  Earl Stapp is in the back  tonight,  because he's getting  short for us.  So from time to time  we're looking  for different people.  I just saw  Ben walk up.  Let's see if we can't  grab Ben for a second.  You know what?  And see what, 
[00:41:30]  Ben,  I just wanted to check  in with you.  The boys are here.  What's the feeling  in the VIP section  that boss has left  his wife behind?  Give him the headphones.  There we go.  Harry,  you're going to keep  up to date with this.  Thanks.  We're asking you,  what's the feeling  the boys are ready  to come out on stage  after one year?  I think they're  pretty excited.  Should be a good event.  Some good costumes.  Lopey's wandering  around right now.  Have you picked out  the people that are  going to be in the  costume contest yet? 
[00:42:00]  I don't know.  We're starting to look around.  What do you guys  think so far?  So far,  as I can see  from up here,  I'm not sure  if I see a winner yet.  I definitely am going  to pick a chick  for myself, though.  But you have to be  careful in this room.  A lot of these chicks  aren't.  The hard rock,  a lot of the hard rock  waitresses  are bus boys.  And there's a Cuban one  who's fucking out of sight.  So be very,  very careful.  Well, you know what?  ONA's audience  without costume  looks like,  they look like mutants.  But now they look normal. 
[00:42:30]  Now they look good.  That's the point.  As they come here  dressed like people  with jobs,  one guy showed up  in a three-piece suit.  And I said,  what are you trying to be?  He goes,  he'll be.  Check it out.  This looks good.  Lucky me,  I'm employed.  Yeah,  I never knew it was you.  Way to go,  Irish Alky.  You pulled it off.  There was a baby Connor  I saw earlier  that I love  in the diaper  and snorkel gear.  Yeah,  I heard there was  an Andrea Yates.  There's a good  banana phone.  There's a good  banana phone guy. 
[00:43:00]  I saw two  banana phones tonight.  Let's bring her over.  Grab her.  Or him.  Yeah.  Beautiful young lady  here,  but look what's  hanging here.  Check this out.  She has an appendage.  How are you doing?  Hi, boss.  A woman with a fake dick  yells,  hi, boss.  I love boss.  That's his core audience.  Let me roll down  my window.  Are you going out tonight?  First of all,  I am originally  Jimmy's girlfriend  right here. 
[00:43:30]  Oh,  that's what you came as?  That's what I came as.  I came as Jimmy's girlfriend  and Norton  somewhere up there.  So,  it's just a girl  with a very tiny dress  with a giant penis  hanging at the bottom.  Yes.  Yes,  quite.  Quite large penis.  Like half your outfit.  I just had  my cock sucked.  That'll happen  at a Halloween party.  It is.  Ron and Fez,  we are live here  getting ready for ONA  to come out on stage 
[00:44:00]  and all kinds of wild people.  I see Patrice O'Neal  has walked in.  Really?  Patrice will suck my cock too.  Yeah.  You and Patrice  work a lot of gigs together,  right, boss?  All right,  now he can't hear me, Fez.  Boss is not.  It's all starting to be pulled away.  It's all starting to be pulled apart.  Boss is not a professional though.  No,  he can't help that.  It's one of those parties  where it can all fall apart quick.  That dildo,  she didn't have to buy.  She just opened her top drawer  and put her costume together. 
[00:44:30]  It was there.  Listen,  I borrowed this one from Bonnie.  Oh!  No, you didn't  because it's white.  Well,  I only like the white cock.  Way to stick up for her, boss.  It's ONA's one year anniversary  and it's just getting to the point now  where it's madness.  I'm going to run.  Okay, buddy.  I'll be back later.  You guys,  good luck in New York.  I haven't seen you.  Thank you very much,  man.  It's great to see you again, too.  I appreciate it, buddy.  Thank you, Rich Voss.  Everybody here tonight  for the ONA one year anniversary party 
[00:45:00]  and the Halloween celebration  all going on live here  at the Hard Rock.  The bands are all  getting ready to start  in just a little bit, too, folks.  Yeah, tribute bands tonight.  This is going to be great.  A lot of fun.  21-12,  they're going to go on first.  That's the Rush tribute band.  They're going to be followed  later on tonight  by Live Wire,  an ACDC tribute band.  And then we wrap it all up tonight  with 2U,  Brother Joe's,  U2 tribute band.  You can check them out online 
[00:45:30]  at notu2.com.  So that's all still to come.  Plus the costume contest  that a lot of the staff members  are milling through the room  as the crowd piles in.  And they're looking for those contestants  that are going to be up on stage  in just a little bit  competing for that grand prize  of $500 plus an XM MiFi.  Second prize will be $300  and a MiFi.  Third prize, $100 and a MiFi.  They're all going home lucky winners.  Fez, I'm also hearing that 
[00:46:00]  so far as the place is filling up  as it is,  unbelievably cool.  I'm happy to hear that.  I'm happy to hear that  everybody's taking care of themselves.  Big, big night in New York City.  Nothing like Halloween in New York City.  Fez, did you get any trick-or-treaters  at your house tonight?  I got some trick-or-treaters,  but of course I was not allowed  to answer the door.  Oh yeah,  because you have your own problems.  So I just keep my pumpkin outside.  Now, I do something 
[00:46:30]  a little differently.  You know how there's always  the fears that people have  that somebody will put  a razor blade in an apple?  Oh yeah, yeah, every year.  I take it in a different direction.  I hand out razor blades  to the kids.  Right.  But every once in a while,  I'll shove some apple in there.  Oh no.  So when the kid goes to shave,  it gets all over his face  and it makes the papers.  Just a face full of applesauce.  Now, if you watched  Maury Povich today, Fez,  you saw a major makeover. 
[00:47:00]  It was the geek and nerd makeover show.  Fez, I want you to turn around  and meet this woman.  Say hello.  Oh, hello, miss.  Fez, do you know who that is?  No, no.  I don't believe we've met.  Fez, I'm sure you've met  Stalker Patty.  What?  Stalker Patty?  That's Stalker Patty.  After her makeover?  After her makeover.  She's beautiful.  Oh.  He's fainted.  Thank you. 
[00:47:30]  Oh.  Stalker Patty,  did you see yourself  on Maury Povich tonight?  What?  Did you see yourself  on TV on Maury Povich?  I had to work.  So you never saw it at all?  No, but somebody said  they would tape it for me,  so I'll get to see it on my DVD.  Now, I noticed as I watched that  you came in with your pants  all the way up to your armpits,  but I never remember  you being dressed that way before.  Well, I don't know.  A couple of times  Anthony said they were 
[00:48:00]  up too high.  I guess that's why  we did it.  Did you have to see it, Buzz?  Yeah, I saw it,  and really,  flying the camel toe  like no other.  We all appreciate that.  Now, what are you  dressed as tonight?  I'm an ant.  Oh, you're just here  as an ant.  Yeah.  I see.  You see my little feeler.  Oh, because Anthony  always talks about your thorax  and your ant-like body.  So, I'm an ant.  So, it's the one-year  anniversary for ONA.  What's it been like for you?  What was it like 
[00:48:30]  when ONA were off the air  for that year?  Who did you stalk then?  Um, you.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  She would actually  come all the way down  when we were working  at DC and see us there, Fezzy.  And I'll give away  this little piece of gossip.  But, you stayed  at Fezzy's house.  Yes.  It was like I was  sponsoring an exchange student.  What I'm worrying  is did any hanky-panky  go down?  No.  Did anything take place  at all?  Not at all. 
[00:49:00]  There was no hanky-panky.  In fact, it was Patty's  first time ever  on an airplane.  So, flying back from DC  the night before her flight,  she slept fully dressed,  even in her socks and shoes.  She did not want to miss  that plane ride.  She was so excited.  You don't think  that she sleeps  in her socks and shoes  every night anyway?  In case of a fire.  I don't think  I was in my socks and shoes.  You were in your glasses.  You were ready to go.  Are you sure  the sick turn out  into some kind  of a Fezzy  Patty make-out party? 
[00:49:30]  There was no  make-out party whatsoever.  No, not at all.  Not at all.  I'm a gentleman.  We were good.  If by gentleman  you mean gay,  then yes,  you are a gentleman.  She had the downstairs  to herself.  That's right.  You know what?  I'm going to put you  and you two together  and call it  90-year-old virgin  and just see  if that could be  the combined ages.  Dr. Patty here with us  tonight in Times Square  because you know 
[00:50:00]  you're dealing  with the stars.  It's Opie and Anthony,  the one-year anniversary.  And we're just having  a blast here  at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Dr. Patty,  why don't you guys  do a shout-out to ONA?  Wish them well  on their one-year anniversary.  Happy anniversary,  Opie and Anthony.  And what would you  like to say to them  from the bottom  of your heart?  From the very bottom  of your heart?  Glad to have you back.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Even though they've been here  for a few years.  All right,  we're going to get ready 
[00:50:30]  to throw some break.  Coming up in just  a little bit, Fezzy,  the bands will be starting  first, though.  ONA will take the stage.  ONA will take the stage.  And then,  right after that,  we should be getting  21-12 on stage,  the Rush Tribute Band.  They'll be kicking off  an evening of tribute bands  featuring Live Wire,  the ACDC Tribute Band,  and 2U,  Brother Joe's,  U2 Tribute Band.  Throw us the break,  will you, Fezzy?  It is Opie and Anthony's  live Halloween 
[00:51:00]  one-year anniversary party  here at the Hard Rock Cafe  in Times Square,  New York City  on XM 202.  Can you say fuck  on this channel?  Oh, Jesus.  That's shocking.  Holy fuck, I need coffee.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's make a deal.  So far,  Patty has won  $570 in cash.  And she's going to use it 
[00:51:30]  to pay some of the rent,  buy that portable  D2D player,  and open up  a savings account  and a bus trip  to Atlantic City.  Wow.  What is she going to do  with the last $200?  Patty,  $200.  Put it away  in case I have  an emergency.  Ah,  an emergency.  All right.  Well,  she really knows  how to spend that money.  And this last $200,  of course,  she is going to earn  by kneeling  on the lesbian couch  with her butt  facing us. 
[00:52:00]  We will then throw  cherry darts  at her  bung  and try to get  a bullseye.  And that will get her  the last $200  that we have  for a grand total  of $770.  What's in it for us?  Absolutely nothing.  Jesus.  We are just doing this  for our fans, Opie.  All right, Patty,  assume the position.  We got the cherries,  we got the whipped cream.  Oh,  we got to open  the cheeks.  We can't get it  in that way.  Yeah,  yeah,  give her the microphone. 
[00:52:30]  Why don't her pants  have to come down,  dude,  because she can't  get in the right  position that way.  Yeah,  Patty,  you're going to have  to lose the pants,  unfortunately.  And the socks.  Believe me,  we don't want to ask  for that,  but you have to.  You can keep the socks on,  but yeah,  can she just pull them  down to her ankles?  No,  because it won't  her teeth fall over.  Yeah,  she needs to kind  of spread her,  uh...  Yeah.  All right.  I want to see it  winking back at her.  You can't aim  the cherry dart  at the cheek.  Right.  So you have to,  um,  just gently,  gently just separate  the cheeks. 
[00:53:00]  That's where the  cherry dart  gets thrown.  That's how it sticks.  Yeah.  All right.  Patty,  have you lost  the jeans?  What?  I got to take  my shoes off first.  All right.  Jesus.  Give me a second.  No problem.  We'll give you a second.  Still to come on the show,  Pat from Monaki  doing the news again.  Oh,  yeah.  What are you...  Can I do a cherry dart?  I can't eat cherries.  I'll lose another toe. 
[00:53:30]  Throw my toes  that have been cut off  at my ass.  Oh,  there she goes.  How comfy  she's getting  being naked now.  I know.  Naughty,  naughty patty.  Not really comfy.  Naughty,  naughty girl you are.  What are you doing?  Yeah,  lean all the way.  You know,  lean like the girl  on page 77  of Hustler Magazine.  Now,  you've got to pull  your shirt up a little bit  so we don't get  cherries on your back.  Okay.  Just go to another place,  Patty.  Yeah.  Go to another place.  You're back 
[00:54:00]  at the foundling center.  You can take a shower  in the O.P. and Anthony  shower after you're done.  Where is that?  And wash away the filth.  Yeah,  you're going to have  to wipe.  I'm not like that.  All right,  well.  This isn't me.  Why isn't anyone  jumping up to get  in position to throw darts?  How many of us  are throwing the darts?  Well,  go ahead,  Jimmy.  Of course.  Give one a throw.  Line up.  You've got to pick  a cherry out.  Ooh,  they're cold.  Oh,  they are.  Get that whipped cream  on there.  All right,  hold on.  I'm going to try  to get over here.  Oh,  God.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:54:30]  Jimmy is setting up  the cherry.  Hold on.  Keeping the stem,  are you?  Always.  Always keeps the stem  really loaded up  with whipped cream  on that one.  Anthony,  the target's still  covered,  Anthony.  Patty,  I can't,  how am I supposed to,  you have to spread  your cheeks  so I can get it in there.  Wow.  I don't think  I've had to do that.  No,  no,  you don't stand  on the floor.  Stay kneeling,  reach back with your hands  and you have to open  your cheeks  so I can throw  the cherry dart in.  Yeah,  all right.  I'm very close.  Oh,  wow,  yeah,  that's it.  That's perfect,  perfect.  Oh, 
[00:55:00]  God.  Oh,  you missed.  I actually had it  on target,  the cherry diverted.  All right.  I,  Anthony,  you're going to go?  Oh,  God.  Hold on,  you've got to open it.  How are you going  to get a cherry in there?  Wait,  wait,  Patty,  you've got to stick  that butt up  in the air  a little bit more.  Oh,  my God.  What are you doing?  Oh,  my God.  No,  Eric,  you've got to get back.  Don't go near her.  Don't go that close to her.  Wait,  wait, 
[00:55:30]  let me.  I'm kidding,  I'm kidding.  Oh,  no.  Wow.  She puckered.  I think I got it  just to the right.  Just to the right  of Ground Zero.  Yeah.  Go ahead,  Opie.  Opie lining up.  What about Sparks?  Ben Sparks?  He will never,  he will never do it.  Anybody else go in?  Ben is not,  Ben doesn't find  this fun at all.  No.  No.  Yeah,  Ben hates this.  Ew,  I'm all sticky now. 
[00:56:00]  I hate sticky.  You've got to open him.  Opie,  just Opie.  Yes.  Spread him.  Open him.  You've got to open him.  There you go.  Why don't,  no,  Patty,  open him,  he can't get in there.  Opie's going for a,  a kneeling approach.  There you go.  Opie's kneeling  to get right on level.  There you go.  Oh,  he slammed into  the right butt cheek.  I think Hawk needs to go.  All right.  Opie's having problems  with his microphone.  Yeah.  Oh,  there it goes.  It's going back in.  There you go. 
[00:56:30]  Hold on.  Hawk.  Go in there  and grab a nice cherry dart.  Pat,  you've got to reach back.  What happened there?  You've got to put your hands  by the hole.  Oh.  Yeah,  there you go.  Oh,  wow.  You've got to spread them.  Yeah,  spread them open.  And stick the butt up in the air.  Push it back a little bit.  Oh,  yeah,  nice arch.  That's called the,  yep,  the penthouse position.  There you go.  Wow,  there's a lot of whipped cream  on that one.  Anything but penthouse.  Oh,  very close.  Just short.  Somebody won.  Again, 
[00:57:00]  the right cheek.  Yeah,  dip that,  that's a good point,  Danny.  Let's dip that apple  in whipped cream.  No.  No apples.  Eric was the closest  so far.  Let's see what else  we can do.  All right,  keep them open  while we tally the vote.  How many more to go  so we can end this?  A couple more.  We're just,  but first,  we got to,  we should get,  I wonder if we should  get Pat in here  just to do the news.  No,  I gotta,  I gotta go to work.  I gotta go.  Wow,  I hope your bosses  don't ever see  this video online. 
[00:57:30]  None of them  have accents,  so.  Yeah,  thank God for that,  right?  Yeah.  We wouldn't want to call  and tell them  to go to Pat.  Right.  No,  no,  no,  don't do that to Pat.  I think we've  done a great job.  Would you give  Patty a paper towel?  Yes.  And let her wipe down?  You got something  to spray on her?  There it is,  ladies and gentlemen.  Stalker Patty,  she's now cleaning up.  She has won the final  $200.  Look at her wiping.  That's nice. 
[00:58:00]  Grand total,  $770.  Won today by Patty  on Let's Make a Deal.  Very good, Patty.  Isn't that amazing  how we parlayed this?  None of it  our money.  It was actually  her money  from the start.  It was just  going to be given  to her.  And we actually  parlayed it  into her getting  the money  we were going  to give her anyway.  Give her that  microphone,  Dan.  I know it wasn't  going to be  that easy.  Patty,  do you realize  we were just  going to give you  that money? 
[00:58:30]  Oh,  but I know  it wasn't  going to be  that easy.  No,  before.  That'd make it fun.  Yeah,  but before you came in,  it was just  going to be that easy.  We had no plans  of doing this today.  We were just  going to hand you  over the money.  But,  you know,  sickos like us  just figured  maybe you'd want  to earn it.  I don't think  you'd respect yourself  if you just  took the money.  $770.  Because now you  earned it.  It's not like  charity.  Patty,  you got like  two bowling 
[00:59:00]  ball holes  back there.  What?  They're just  very small.  Very small?  Well,  they haven't been  used for anything.  They're,  she probably  takes like  little rabbit  dumps,  like there's  like six  little pellets  when she walks  all over the rug.  You want to  present Patty  with this,  Jimmy?  There you go.  All right.  The last $200.  There you go,  Patty.  Patty,  this last $200  is for kneeling  on the couch  and opening  your asshole  so we can  throw fruit at it. 
[00:59:30]  When you put it  like that.  All right.  Wow, Patty.  We can get  the shades back up,  get some sunlight  back in the studio.  Yeah.  All sunlight.  This is great.  Get my dignity back.  Patty,  congratulations.  There you go,  Patty.  Thanks, Patty.  Off to work you go.  Thanks to you, bro.  Her ass smelling  like souring  whipped cream  throughout the day,  I'm sure.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  There you go.  You got your money.  Thanks, man.  Put your shoes on.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  There she goes, Patty. 
[01:00:00]  Patty, Patty.  Living the studio.  Practicing good hygiene.  Look at her.  She's waiting now.  What?  Bye-bye.  All right. 
[01:00:30]  It's Ron and Fez.  We are back here  for the Opie and Anthony  one-year anniversary party.  We are live  in the middle of Times Square  in New York City, New York.  In a packed Hard Rock Cafe,  Opie and Anthony  celebrating one year  on XM Satellite Radio.  Plus, of course,  it's the Halloween party  going on, too.  So this place is getting  packed, packed with people  in a lot of wacky costumes. 
[01:01:00]  Now, Fez,  at this point,  I thought we would be seeing  Livewire, the ACDC,  tribute band,  but just the same thing  that Sly Stone  pulled at Woodstock,  where he would not  leave the trailer  because he didn't feel  the vibe.  That's what's happening  right now with Livewire.  Livewire will not  come out of the trailer.  Oh, okay.  Everyone's pulling  a George Clinton here.  Now, yeah.  It is very, very much  of a P-Funk situation.  Now, whenever O&A  come out on stage 
[01:01:30]  or Livewire shows up,  we will immediately  throw it to the stage,  Fezzy.  Until that point,  you and I are just  talking through a rain delay.  It's kind of a rain delay  situation,  and we're going to  keep that going.  So we're high above  the crowd as the party  gets underway.  Now, they got those  special limited edition  Opie and Anthony  one-year Halloween party.  Opie and Anthony.  There you go.  Limited edition  Halloween party T-shirts.  They were handing them  out as you came in. 
[01:02:00]  Now, if you weren't able  to make it to the party  tonight, you can go to  OpieandAnthony.com  and order your T-shirt there.  I'm going to get one  for myself.  Fez, look who just  came in behind you  all dressed up.  It's our friend Winnie  who's just coming in  with the tits out.  The tits are just  completely out.  And, you know,  a lot of women  try to take the attitude  of, hey, it's Halloween.  I'm going to be slutty.  I'm going to warn you  this, Winnie.  Some men just rape.  That's all they do 
[01:02:30]  is rape.  For me, I guess  every day is Halloween  because I'm always slutty.  It's always tits out.  Yeah.  Didn't have a chance  to get to the costume shop?  What happened?  No, I just decided  to show them.  Winnie's kind of the  illegitimate daughter  of Bette Midler.  And she's always  leaning with the breasts.  Now, basically,  your breasts are out,  you're bobbing them around,  but you have a gold tooth.  Well, it's kind of  like a pimp costume.  It's just falling apart.  Like, I got the money,  I got the hat,  but it's really hot in here,  so I figured,  let the tits speak  for themselves.  You're a big-breasted 
[01:03:00]  girl pimp tonight.  Yeah, basically.  Wow.  Now, this is an exciting  night for you.  Three bands.  I know.  Who do you leave with?  I am definitely checking.  Actually, I was considering  going to the band's  website and checking them out  so I would have a plan.  Of course.  But then I decided  I'm just going to go with it  and see what happens.  I'm going to assume  a bass player.  You ought to do  a Sweet Connie tribute.  You know what?  That is, yeah.  We're an American band.  Very nice reference, Fez.  Thank you.  Well, we're at the  Hard Rock tonight.  I only wish Earl  was here.  He would have got it. 
[01:03:30]  He would have laughed.  Earl stabbed us in the back  and refused to show up tonight.  He got on the  Underground Railroad  and headed out of town.  Is that how he...  That's called a subway.  Are you sure they didn't  just not let him in?  Because I don't see  any other black people here.  You know what?  There aren't any  other black people,  but a lot of people  in blackface,  and that's uncomfortable  for me.  Always a classy crowd.  It's 2005.  I don't know if the  blackface is going  to get over it.  I know if this was  like 1905,  people would be laughing  and enjoying themselves,  but it's not.  Ron and Fez, 
[01:04:00]  we are live.  Middle of Times Square,  O&A's one-year anniversary,  which means, Fez,  one year without  getting fired.  Congratulations, boys.  All right.  So, yeah,  that's a pat on the  back right there.  Yes, and also a nice  thing to say to the  restaurant.  As I'm looking around  the restaurant,  and you see so many  of the XM bigwigs here,  it's really a tribute  to them for not  firing O&A when they've  had so many opportunities.  Sure.  They just stay in the  course, and it's a  good thing. 
[01:04:30]  It's a year of restraint.  I believe the Chinese  New Year for that.  Fez, I turn around  behind you, and there  seems to be an action  figure.  If you could just keep  handing the headphones  over, it's our good  friend, Too Cute,  and Too Cute, I'm going  to try to figure out  Are you here as  Gladiator?  Is that the look for  you tonight?  Is it Gladiator?  I think Cartoon.  80s.  80s Cartoon, you  haven't missed? 
[01:05:00]  I'm going to go  Danger Mouse.  I'm going to say  Jabberjaw.  Jabberjaw.  No.  Who is it Too Cute?  I'm Teela from He-Man.  Oh, Teela from He-Man.  Of course, Teela from  He-Man.  Yeah.  I think you're going  to end up winning the  500 bucks tonight.  It's very snow-related.  Normally, you're more  of a Lord of the Rings,  I feel.  Normally, but I just  figured the Vulcaneers  are a little out this  year.  Yeah, they are.  The Vulcaneers are out. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, I can't imagine  that Lord of the Rings  isn't cool anymore.  Yeah, I know.  I have trouble  accepting that.  It's the Vulcaneers.  By the way, you've got a  nice Vulcan ass.  If that means anything  to you right now,  and I hope it does.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  What time do you  start dancing on the bar?  Do you know?  Two, three more drinks?  She's on her way, Fezzy.  What I like in New York City  is you get patted down  in the subway,  but everyone's allowed  to bring in, like, 
[01:06:00]  a fake sword or a staff,  a big stick,  something like that.  Not a problem.  There's so many weapons  in here.  Fake guns,  you name it.  But for whatever reason,  you can get away with it  because it's Halloween.  It's Halloween.  Yeah, you walk down  the streets of New York City,  you're passing a cat or two  on the way here.  And yet, you touch a kid,  and everybody freaks out,  makes a big deal out of it.  Oh, tell me about it.  I know.  I know.  I had to get to that  meeting in Jersey  before I could come here  tonight.  It was just  pain in the ass.  Ron and Fez live 
[01:06:30]  at the ONA  one-year anniversary party.  Now, again, Fezzy,  I was told that you and I  were brought here  to kind of do  the radio portion  to host a little bit.  Right.  Hey, boys,  we only need you  to come on  for a couple of minutes,  then throw it  directly to the bands.  But there's some  kind of a diva,  three Madonna thing  going on right now  with these tribute bands.  I guess everybody  wants to close.  Nobody wants  to come out far.  So they're playing  this game of, 
[01:07:00]  hey, just how big  is your tribute penis  before we come out here?  I don't know  what's going to happen.  Yeah, I don't know  if earlier there was  a shoving match backstage  between 21-12  and Live Wire.  Yeah.  But apparently  everyone's holding out  before they come back  out on the stage  so we get to see  the tribute band start.  Now, this always  gets to me, Fez.  I'm noticing some  of the people dressed.  This is kind of  an annoyance for me  where people will  wear a costume  and then believe  that they're now  an actor playing a part.  So the Jesus guy, 
[01:07:30]  he keeps standing  next to me  and blessing me  the entire time  as if I think  he's really Jesus.  Here's an odd look here.  This guy's dressed  as Eric Logan,  Vice President  of Programming.  And look at the hair,  Ronnie.  What a mess the hair is.  Yeah.  So, yeah,  the stars are out  tonight in the middle  of Times Square.  Yeah, I've seen  a couple of  JonBenets.  JonBenet and Ramsey  and you can't beat that.  Colorado over there.  Yeah, a few of those 
[01:08:00]  tonight.  And you know what?  I said that way  to be current.  I mean,  there's a joke  that's, what,  ten years now?  Eight, nine years?  Never grows old  since I'm there.  Between the JonBenets  and the Baby Connors,  I've never seen  so many dead children  in one room.  Timeless, though,  dead children.  Do you know  if JonBenet would have lived,  she'd be old enough  to fuck?  Really?  And that stunned me.  That one stunned me.  Well, I hope her father  realizes what he did.  I know.  He went and wasted  a perfectly nice  piece of ass. 
[01:08:30]  So it's sad.  All right.  We just lost Danny.  We just lost Danny  who's helping us  tonight on that one.  I saw you cringe  on the JonBenet.  Let me just say this  in my defense.  I was supposed  to be out of here  about 45 minutes ago.  I'm stretching.  I'm stretching right now.  I should be knee-deep  in a Caesar salad,  just enjoying myself  having some dinner.  Yeah.  That's an image.  So we do want to thank Danny.  He came down from XMDC,  from the headquarters,  up and run the show 
[01:09:00]  with Mars tonight.  Special thanks to those guys.  Terrific job, Mars.  Doing a hell of a job.  Here's Wiki.  Wiki, have we gotten  any kind of updates  on why the bands  are pulling the  Sly and the Family Stone  situation?  From what I understand,  the AC,  DC tribute band  refuses to leave  their trailer.  Do you know why  they're acting this way?  I have no idea.  Did you think 
[01:09:30]  that you would run  into this kind of  diva situation  with tribute bands?  Not at all.  Yeah.  However,  have you heard the CD  of the guys?  No, I haven't.  It might be worthwhile  them not coming on stage  because I'm telling you,  they're holding out  because they're good.  They are that good?  Oh, yeah.  They're that good?  They're good.  They're dead on.  Have you heard the CD, Fez?  Because I'd like to  throw it on now  if I could.  I would like to  throw in an album side  to see what I think of it.  That would be great.  Or even maybe  an actual ACDC CD. 
[01:10:00]  At this point,  sniffing the tears.  I'd throw in  a sniffing the tears.  It's Ron and Fez  we are live  from  and you can listen  to the crowd.  We'll just grab  the mic here.  I think they're  all having a great time.  Hey, that's our line.  And they're just saying  so I could stay here  all night. 
[01:10:30]  Yes, they're having  a great time.  Start the fucking show!  Start the fucking show!  I don't know  if a building  can be rocked loose  but it's happening.  Start the fucking show!  I can't tell  if that's a 21-12 chant  or an online chant.  I can't tell which one it is.  Start the fucking show!  I think...  I'm not sure  what they're shouting  but I know  it's not saying  we have a lot of patience  so take your time.  It is  kind of surprising 
[01:11:00]  that the doors open  at 7 o'clock  and yet  here we are  without a band  on stage  without the boys  on stage.  Yeah, the crowd  getting a little restless.  Of course,  when you come dressed  as a banana phone  Right.  You know,  your patience  is going to wear thin.  It's going to start  to get warm.  Yeah.  I like the fact  that they build up  with their anger  and then they felt like  hey, we're heard  people know  where we're coming from  and we can live  with that now. 
[01:11:30]  That's amazing  it didn't take too long  to spread through the crowd.  No.  Oh, you know what?  Now you know how it was  like at that great white show  in Rhode Island.  Hey.  Was that a great white tribute band?  You know what?  I wouldn't go to that show  and I'll tell you why  I'm superstitious.  I would not go to a great  first of all  I'd be like  if I went to see  a great white tribute band  I'd be standing  with one foot out the door  and a bucket of water  ready to pour it on my head.  Oh, sure.  You want to go in  and wet it down already. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I believe the great white  tribute band  is called Great Beige.  Is that right?  Yeah, just a little off  from great white.  A little off white.  Mm-hmm.  That's the fun thing  about tribute bands.  Off great white.  Yeah.  You really don't know  what you're going to be getting.  All right.  Since the start  the fucking show  chance started  Master Poe  is waiting himself  on the very front  of the stage  just in case  ready to take on  anyone  who's after the bizoids.  Do you think you could  take them all, though?  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, yeah.  The banana guy?  What I suggest  Master Poe do  is take the stick  away from the He-Man girl  and just start swinging that.  Disarm her first  and then go from there.  All right.  The chant is starting again  as you can hear.  Now, luckily for Fez and I,  we're up high above.  Yeah, I'm a little fair, though.  Yeah.  We're up high above  the hard rock.  Looking down on it,  just to kind of  paint a picture for you,  it's the same thing  that you would see  at Monday Night Football.  Where would John Madden  be sitting right now?  In the press box. 
[01:13:00]  Now, the crowd,  they got surly  real quick there.  It kind of simmered down.  And what Master Poe  has done  is walked on stage  making the crowd  think the show  was starting.  Right.  And all he did  was fuel their ire  all over again.  So, for someone  who's working security,  I don't know  if that was the best move.  Well, it helps you  when you're in a bad mood  to see a guy  come out and glare at you.  Like, please,  go ahead and try it.  Look, there's someone  screaming directly  at him right now.  He is staring down,  I believe, 
[01:13:30]  a heavyset man  dressed as Howard Stern.  It's hard to tell  from here.  No, that's  the Vampire Lestat.  The Vampire Lestat  has walked out there  and is just staring  the crowd down.  Uh-oh.  Now, the in-house music  has stopped  and that got everyone  excited again.  O&A will be  coming out on stage  soon,  with or without  one of these tribute bands.  Let me just say,  if you need someone  to go into a trailer 
[01:14:00]  and calm some band guys down,  I am the girl for you.  Jeez, what a shock  you're ready to blow  band guys in the trailer.  Just to help out  to steam.  You know,  I'm a team player.  We ought to put you  in a glass case  and just have  a little hammer there  in case a blowjob  emerges.  Break glass.  Well, we'll have her  behind one case,  she'll be behind the other.  OB, Anthony,  Jim Norton,  all day,  are in the building  and I believe  once the problem  is settled  between the  Rush Tribute Band 
[01:14:30]  2112  and the ACDC  Tribute Band  Livewire,  once that's settled,  I believe the show  is going to get  underway.  Yeah,  because no matter  what happens,  2U has got to  close the show tonight.  Yeah,  we're all agreed  on that.  All right,  Hard Rock Johnny  just came by.  Johnny,  you know the situation  that is going on  right now  from what we understand,  the Tribute Band  refused to leave  their trailers  because,  like they said, 
[01:15:00]  ACDC would never  open for Rush,  they would close.  We've got a little  situation,  but I've got someone  backstage trying  to work it out.  How are things  in the green room?  Tense?  A little tense.  I have to call in  a mediator,  a rock and roll mediator.  By the way,  green room,  that's the Tribute Band  for Green Day.  Love those guys.  Yeah.  Love those guys  and this was a big year  for them.  By the way,  Fezzy,  the other exciting  thing is,  I'm about to  make the announcement  to the crowd.  I know we're  a little late here. 
[01:15:30]  What about free appetizers?  And we just  attempt to throw  them potato skins.  Throw chicken fingers  or stuff like that.  As many if we have to.  Yeah.  By the way,  nothing for Earl tonight.  He gets nothing.  You know,  I said chicken fingers  and you know  that's his favorite.  Right,  that was what his mom  used to call him  as she laid him  down in the crib.  Natty not chicken fingers,  Natty not.  So,  but you really  have to be part  of the team.  You have to be here  on the front lines  at the Hard Rock Cafe.  That's right. 
[01:16:00]  Sorry Earl.  To get the reward.  I'll bring something by.  Maybe I'll bring some  lunch later in the week  or I'll for you.  Just for me and Ronnie.  Yeah.  I would love to have you  come by again too,  Johnny.  And remember,  how can I forget?  Yeah.  Dessert is part of the meal.  I don't know  the meal,  which I would like to see  put up as a logo  somewhere.  Get that branded  for yourself.  Love all,  serve all,  all is one.  Dessert is part of the meal.  Put that as a sign  up here  and maybe take down  the giant Quaalude.  What I'd like to do  is get that giant  Quaalude down 
[01:16:30]  and let some of the  crowd chew on it  until they calm down.  If you guys are nice,  you'll eat a big 714.  Throw it in the middle  of the room,  let them all peck at it  like pigeons  on a bagel or something.  You know,  at one point,  I found myself  with a 714 T-shirt  as a kid  and my mom  washed it  and then threw it out  when she figured out  it was a Quaalude  with wings.  And it said,  actually, 
[01:17:00]  fly 714.  I never got to get any.  I never got any  of that good stuff.  I think I'm a little too  young for the Quaalude.  You really miss  the fun years.  The two and all.  The loods.  There's still good stuff  out there.  Yeah, I know there is.  But now I'm in the middle.  See,  what are we talking about?  I'm just saying,  there's good stuff.  Now you no longer want it,  Johnny, I'm a middle now.  You know,  in college it was good.  I had a little acid,  a little mescaline,  a little weed.  And then I stopped.  Now I'm too old  to do anything.  And now I know  there's other good stuff  out there,  but I'm too old. 
[01:17:30]  You said it the other day.  Once you hit a certain age,  you can't do acid.  Well, you know,  you'll hit it like  nothing funnier  than seeing a 22-year-old kid  throwing up.  When you're 30  and throwing up,  it's like,  oh my God,  that's pathetic.  I couldn't even imagine  tripping my face off  on mushrooms right now.  You know what I might do  is go show.  A little later tonight,  I'll do for you  what I've done  for so many friends.  Wait until you pass out  and then you wake up dosed.  Hard Rock Johnny,  you wear too many  flame shirts to trip.  Actually,  you're going to think 
[01:18:00]  you're the human torch.  Some of the shirts  that you have  almost make me flashback.  They really do.  You know,  and everyone asks me,  where do you get those shirts?  And I tell them,  it's a fat guy store.  Where else am I going  to get my shirts?  Well, that's what a fat guy  wants,  a big, bright, loud shirt  that's going to draw attention  to what area?  Oh, yeah.  Here below the chins,  up here above the girth.  You might as well  be wearing a jacket  saying,  guess what I weigh?  It's not something  you want to do.  What am I going to do, 
[01:18:30]  you know?  I'm glad.  I can't help it.  I know if you've tuned in  right now to hear  O&A live on stage  for one year anniversary,  you've got to be saying  to yourself,  hey,  why are Ron and Fez  rambling?  Well,  number one,  we're good friends.  Number two,  we're good employees.  And Wiki roped us into this.  Exactly.  It was come in  to a couple of minutes  so when I would come out,  I'd make sure  everything goes smooth.  You know what?  I barely had time  to make my last costume change 
[01:19:00]  during the last break.  What are you dressed as now?  I was trying to guess  what that was.  Ronnie,  you can't tell  what this is?  I really can't.  Stella Stevens  from the Poseidon Adventure,  my salute to old Hollywood.  Is that why  you're soaking wet?  Yes.  I see.  A lot of people  think I was just sweating.  No,  it's Stella Stevens  who played  Ernest Gorknine's wife  in Poseidon Adventure.  She was fantastic.  Hey,  when she died,  not a dry eye  in the drive-in.  Right,  that's true.  The whole drive-in  was crying.  Was she the championship 
[01:19:30]  swimmer?  She was the championship  swimmer  much as Fez was.  You know,  Fez,  and we've run this up  a couple of times,  you know,  Fez was a sickly boy  and he wasn't  allowed to leave  the house.  Fatty pneumonia.  And the neighborhood  kids used to call him  fatty pneumonia.  I just learned that  the other day.  Yeah,  fatty pneumonia  was his nickname  growing up.  Have you seen  the comic strips online?  Yeah,  and it's taken off.  Comic strips?  What?  They've made up  a comic strip  called fatty pneumonia  and also book jackets 
[01:20:00]  for children's books.  Different adventures  that fatty pneumonia  doesn't go on.  I'm telling you  right now, Fezzy,  if we actually  took these things  and wrote them up,  we'd make a fucking  fortune with it  because they're  just incredibly hysterical.  All right,  as a child,  I was the odd  combination of  robust  and yet  had a sickly  constitution.  Right.  Things you don't  usually see  go together.  But wasn't it  nice for you  to have a TV show  where one of the  main characters  was called Weezy? 
[01:20:30]  Didn't that help you?  It helped me  because I had  bad lungs.  Yeah.  Well,  one of the reasons,  I guess because  your lungs were so bad,  you couldn't run much  as a child, right?  Yeah,  maybe a couple  steps put together  to go watch  the Jeffersons.  That was running  to the living room.  All right,  I have,  in my headphones  right now,  I'm talking  with the backstage  people,  and they tell me  that we're moments  away from O&A  taking the stage.  All right,  O&A taking the stage,  and then we'll figure 
[01:21:00]  it out.  I believe the  first tribute band  will be 21-12,  the Rush tribute band.  I'm not sure,  now we hear  maybe 21 Jump Street,  which is a Johnny Depp  tribute band.  Oh,  I love that.  Yeah.  That's the best.  I love them.  Is it?  Oh,  no,  it's not Johnny Depp,  we're just giving it  Richard Rico.  so it's later in 21 Jump Street.  Peter DeLuise is in  that one still.  You know,  there's nothing else  to do.  I thought that was  your costume tonight,  Hard Rock. 
[01:21:30]  It's a good one,  Fuzzy.  Thank you.  I'm calling this  fatty pneumonia  as a friend.  The bad part about  fatty pneumonia,  that's what the kids  in the neighborhood  called me,  and then,  oddly enough,  it worked backwards,  it caught on with my family.  Oh,  then my mother  would just call me that.  Oh,  yeah.  And she also called you  Fat Mo.  All right,  the crowd having a great time  saying,  please take your time.  And thank God  you put us up high, 
[01:22:00]  Johnny.  I would hate to be  in the middle of that day.  Yeah,  they don't look at all  aggressive to me.  Yeah,  no,  not at all.  Well,  it's a patient crowd,  and they know  they want everything  to be just perfect  before ONA  and the tribute band  start to take the stage.  Now,  I see Tommy Chong  has walked out on stage,  so hopefully,  he'll be able  to do a couple of minutes.  So,  I guess we're going  to break here,  and when we come back,  Fezzy,  we have a guarantee  that the boys  are going to be on stage.  All right,  that sounds good. 
[01:22:30]  More or less.  We're here at the Hard Rock  in the middle of Times Square  in New York City.  Hard Rock,  Johnny,  thank you so much  for having the guys  out here.  We'll take a break.  We'll come back  for the boys.  All right,  we are here  live at the Hard Rock,  like we said,  Times Square,  New York City.  Opie and Anthony  celebrating one year  on XM Satellite Radio.  They'll be taking the stage soon.  Halloween party  right here  on XM.  Party Rock.  XM Channel 202. 
[01:23:00]  Seemed appropriate.  It's date night.  Get your shovel.  I never really find  a good sound effect  of a guy getting  hit in the head  with a shovel.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

[01:31:00]  Thank you, everybody.  Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday to you!  Thank you.  A quick question.  Is there anybody here?  What's that, sir? 
[01:31:30]  Bill Burr will be out in a second.  He's in the back fucking your mother, sir.  Actually, he's eating her ass.  Patrice is teabagging her.  Just a quick question.  Is there anybody here with a vagina who will talk to me?  There's a few.  There's no filter, Paul, in the front row.  Dressed like a black guy.  Yes, dressed like the black sheriff.  He's hoping to get his dick sucked, obviously, right, Paul? 
[01:32:00]  Yes.  There's a reason why Jimmy and I came on stage first, because we like men.  Yes, exactly.  No, it's because we decided not to dress up.  We're a bunch of pussies.  Yeah.  So we wanted to give...  We wanted to give Anthony the big intro tonight.  Are you guys ready to see the rapier?  Ladies and gentlemen, Anthony! 
[01:32:30]  It is a pleasure to be here and bow for you people.  Well, you are all... 
[01:33:00]  All of you are nobles to me.  Where's your gun?  Where's your gun?  Where's your gun?  Why would I need a gun when I hold Excalibur?  Excalibur!  Nice.  Yeah, this will go up against the pistol real well.  If he, like, hits right here, that'll freak him the fuck out, right? 
[01:33:30]  And just a bit of trivia, this is the actual outfit that Robert Reed was buried in.  How long?  30 seconds on stage?  Robert Reed joke.  Why not?  Let's hear it for Anthony, you guys.  Oh, bless you.  Bless you, my liege.  Yes.  We also want to take this time to intro a bunch of people and make the show work every single morning on XM Satellite Radio.  Who do we have back there? 
[01:34:00]  Oh, we should bring out Bill Burr, everyone.  Bill Burr!  Bill Burr!  Where's Bill?  Oh, you were a costume in there.  Hello, how are you?  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.  You're going to have to wait to see it on pay-per-view.  I say Bill and I have a contest.  We both show our cocks, and whoever is bigger, we both suck them anyway. 
[01:34:30]  I forfeit.  That's called win-win.  Let's hear it for Bill Burr, everyone.  Clap for Billy Burr, the funniest guy in the country.  I believe he'll be doing the show with us next week, because we're losing Jimmy again.  It's all right.  It's all right.  I'll be fired from HBO shortly.  As soon as I get arrested with a tranny in Los Angeles, I'll be back full-time. 
[01:35:00]  It's like, Bill Burr stinks.  All right, who else do we have hanging out backstage?  We also have a man who's not only one of the funniest comics, but he's a toxic cancer of a human being.  Please welcome Patrice O'Neill.  Clap for Patrice O'Neill.  Patrice!  I love the 80s.  Patrice. 
[01:35:30]  Could you show Patrice what you showed me?  Oh, wait.  Come on.  Lovely.  Come on stage.  Don't be shy.  Not the baby white ones.  The white nigger ones.  What is it?  Are we allowed to do this tonight or what?  I don't even know.  I didn't go over the rules with anybody.  Get your cameras out.  Wait.  Here's a quick photo op for everybody.  Come on, everybody. 
[01:36:00]  Get ready to enjoy those cooked egg titties.  Come on.  One, two, three.  Everybody bake a cake.  Oh.  Nice.  Nice.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Wow.  All right.  He's like the biggest whore in Stacey's life.  Hey, you're in a really nice costume.  You're dressed as a girl.  I'm going to attack sexually in an hour.  I almost did rape, but that would have been too rough.  Is Big Kev backstage? 
[01:36:30]  Let's bring Big Kev out here because he dressed as Patrice.  If we can find Big Kev real.  Here he is.  Big Kev dressed as Patrice.  Oh, my God.  Yo, I got to get a copy of that.  Very nice.  All right.  Thank you, Big Kev.  Who else we got back there, Jimmy? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, we have, of course, a guy.  One of the guys who did not abandon us when we came back.  Give it up for Rich Voss, who has been loyal to this show since we were at N.E.W.  Rich Voss, everyone.  Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  It never fails.  O&A, folks.  You can't move on.  Come on, Rich Voss, everybody.  Thumbs in his middle finger the same length. 
[01:37:30]  No, you've been out here too long already.  Bonnie, Bonnie's waiting.  Hello, Poopsie.  I'm out on stage.  I see you.  I love you too.  Who wants to see Bonnie?  Let's bring Bonnie out.  Where's Mrs. Voss?  Here's Bonnie, everybody.  All right. 
[01:38:00]  Who else we got back there?  Let's say hi to Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  I broke my fucking knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  How you guys doing?  All right?  You're the best crowd ever. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, what do you do for a living?  Where you from, fag?  Hold my hand, faggot.  Hold my hand, faggot.  Hold my hand.  Hold my hand.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Bob Kelly.  Anyone else back there?  Wait, we have a...  Oh, yeah.  We got to introduce, of course, from GTA.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  What's we doing?  What are you, keeping her up there just to fuck her later?  Yes. 
[01:39:00]  It's like...  How about you?  Yeah, you can go back into the crowd.  He's so insecure, he doesn't want to let her back in the crowd.  No, that's not true.  You're here with a guy, aren't you?  Are you here with a guy?  He doesn't care?  Yeah, that's mattered.  No, she was just staying here.  Could you flash one more time?  All right, go.  If he can't fuck her, he'll just jerk off in front of the lovely couple.  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  We have one more person introduced really fast. 
[01:39:30]  He's been helping us out a lot lately.  From GTA, Laszlo.  Where's Laszlo?  That's for Laszlo.  Laszlo.  Who, who, tell him Fred.  Soon to be heard on 202.  If we get it up.  Production king.  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  What the fuck? 
[01:40:00]  Patrice.  Sorry, pumpkin.  Whip him out.  Whip him out.  Go ahead, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Just pull him out.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Ain't she a beautiful girl?  I love her so much.  Wow.  She's with you.  What a fucking...  And I love her.  And I love her.  Oh, man.  Great girl.  Lovely tree size. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, I'm going to beat off in a minute.  Good man.  Good God.  How awful is that girl that is?  Oh, very nice.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Hey, Jimmy.  How awful does that girl feel right now?  Liberator.  I think we've established a headliner.  She couldn't feel that bad.  She doesn't have to fuck him at the end of the night.  Hey, before...  We've got to introduce somebody else, too, of course.  I don't know where he is.  The real sociopath at our studio. 
[01:41:00]  Master Poe.  We've got to give a nice round of applause.  Hey!  To Master Poe.  It's getting hot in here.  He really is one of them.  Oh, and a party rock!  And, of course...  Of course, we couldn't forget... 
[01:41:30]  Wherever he is.  Club Soda Kenny.  You have to give a round of applause to Club Soda Kenny.  Hi.  Kenny, you want to tell a joke?  Come on, Kenny.  Tell a joke.  Come on.  Lighten the mood up a little.  You silly goose.  You have to...  All right, listen up now.  You've got to excuse me.  I'm a little tired tonight.  Because my dog was barking all night long.  Until I threw a shoe at it.  It was a hush puppy. 
[01:42:00]  Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  I like the joke better that ends with cunt.  I say we get the first band on stage.  You guys, we've got lots more to do tonight.  We're going to introduce you guys to Big A and Stalker Patty.  And we're going to bring a lot of you guys up with your costumes.  But first, let's hear it for 2112.  And thank you for coming.  Open. 
[01:42:30]  2-2.  Hello, New York.  Hello, New York.  Modern day warrior, mean me a shrine. 
[01:43:00]  Today's summer, so you meet me a car.  Though his mind is not prevent  Don't put him down as arrogant  He deserves a quiet defense  Riding out the day's events 
[01:43:30]  Every event  What you say about his company  Is what you say about society  Catch the myth  Catch the myth  Catch the mystery  Catch the drift  The world is the world 
[01:44:00]  The love that I'm partying  Baby, I say, guys  All right  The days come so he gets high on you  When the space of your face hit his fly on you. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, my God.
