<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of "Chunky Radio," featuring numerous mocking audio clips highlighting the host Chunky's perceived failings: awkward on-air persona, repetitive NYC references (obsessively mentioning 57th Street), generic sound effects, and low production quality.  The hosts read numerous offensive tweets aimed at Chunky, drawing comparisons between Chunky’s perceived failures and their own success.  They promised to play more Chunky Radio clips later, along with their favorite Frankie Blue audio clip, known for his intoxicated and incoherent contest announcements.  The segment also briefly touched on Britney Spears’ lip-synced concert.  The hosts enthusiastically reviewed "Observe and Report," mentioning upcoming guests Ray Liotta, John Cena, and Jay Moore.  Cena’s recent comments on steroid use in sports were briefly discussed.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the Beatles, their musical evolution, and the hosts’ contempt for Beatles haters, referencing conversations with Lemmy Kilmister and Ozzy Osbourne. This segued into a discussion of the Rolling Stones' longevity.  The broadcast then veered into a bizarre series of audio clips and discussions: a nonsensical song, Keith Richards impressions, and a lengthy, sexually suggestive bit about a Japanese astronaut testing odor-free underwear.  More Frankie Blue clips followed, showcasing his increasingly incoherent contest announcements, prompting speculation about his dismissal.  Further criticism of Chunky Radio ensued, comparing it to a previous show hosted by Rocco, highlighting repetitive phrases and fabricated phone calls.  John Cena and Jay Moore were again mentioned as upcoming guests.  Cena was interviewed about his new movie, "12 Rounds," and his opinions on A-Rod and PEDs in sports.

John Cena joined the show, promoting "12 Rounds" and his WrestleMania match. The conversation took many offensive and crude tangents, including Cena’s upcoming wedding, jokes about athletes (Damon, Walker, Schilling), and a lengthy discussion of professional wrestling, including Vince McMahon’s health and WWE storylines. Ray Liotta then joined, giving a positive review of "Observe and Report" and discussing his career, engaging in further vulgar humor with the hosts.  The conversation included discussions of body doubles and explicit sexual acts.  The segment concluded with more promotion of Cena’s movie and WrestleMania, a brief discussion of a Taylor Hicks incident, and the hosts’ interactions with other celebrities.


Ray Liotta's interview continued, focusing on his experiences filming *Goodfellas*, including a long tracking shot with Lorraine Bracco and a scene with Henny Youngman. He discussed working with De Niro and Anthony Hopkins, and shared an anecdote about Christopher Walken’s reaction to a bird on set. Jay Moore, also present, contributed to the often vulgar back-and-forth, sharing explicit anecdotes alongside Liotta, including a detailed account of Liotta’s threesome.  A Twitter competition ensued between the hosts and Moore to tweet a picture of Liotta first, followed by discussions about publicists (using highly offensive language) and a Las Vegas cab driver's story about the biblical origin of Black people.  A 911 call was played, and Janine, present in the studio, briefly participated.  The overall atmosphere was highly informal and loud.

A surprise guest, balloon animal artist Janine, was introduced by Opie.  The hosts and Janine engaged in crude, sexually suggestive humor, discussing her weight loss and previous occupation.  Offensive jokes were directed at Janine and each other.  Jimmy "the Greek" was also present, contributing to the raunchy tone.  Ray Liotta’s presence outside was mentioned, causing Opie’s nervousness.  A 911 call about a man being assaulted by his wife was played.  Jay Moore promoted his shows, and other comedians (Norton, Kreischer, Edwards, O'Neal) were discussed.  The conversation included celebrity gossip (Jenny McCarthy, Kathy Griffin), movie reviews (*Godfather*, *Insomnia*), and an Al Pacino impersonation.  The segment concluded with further promotion of Jay Moore's shows.

The broadcast concluded with a simple "see you soon. Bye-bye. Bye-bye."

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  What would I sacrifice in a chimp attack so the family gets 50 mil?  50 mil for a chimp attack?  50 million?  I'd put on a chip outfit and bite my mother's face off.  I was lucky enough to be in Istanbul.  It's 90-something percent Muslim, but it was the good kind.  I mean, every once in a while you would see one and they would point out that's a radical Muslim.  They were pretty regular.  Holding a head in his hand.  This is what's left of a Pennsylvania dog kennel after a propane tank ignited, setting the pens on fire. 
[00:04:30]  The Opie and Anthony radio show, the most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, my God.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  I swear to you.  What's wrong?  What happened?  Anthony, why can't you hear us?  Can you believe this?  Why can't you hear us?  Hey, Anthony doesn't have headphones.  I always assume my headphones are going to be here, and then right at the last minute I look, 
[00:05:00]  because that's when I put them on.  Yeah.  Because I'm just fiddling about.  And they weren't here.  Well, fiddle about.  My headphones.  I'm going to miss somebody.  Yeah, somebody's head's going to roll.  Whose responsibility was that?  No, it's weird.  It's like, whoa.  You're not saying.  I like how no one says.  Where do the headphones have to go?  Yeah, they've got to go in a sterile environment.  Why would you have to?  A sterile environment.  All right.  Oh, that's you? 
[00:05:30]  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  You lost good status.  Isn't this?  You were the guy.  Oh, Paul.  Not Paul.  Five.  Oh, not you, Uncle Paul.  Oh, phew.  Paul the intern, the star intern, just got knocked down a peg or two.  Star intern.  Oh, boy.  He got the star name, and then he just starts slacking.  See what happens?  That's why you can't give stars to nobody.  You've got to keep them guessing.  Headphones.  Hey!  I don't know nothing about my headphones.  He was in the earbuds business with my father. 
[00:06:00]  My father, that's all.  And I had a nice intro, because we were going to kind of throw the ball around a little bit.  But the first phone call, listen to Chunk Radio last night.  It sucks.  Chunk Radio.  Chunky in New York, you're on the line.  And Sam did a very good job.  We got a few tracks of Chunk Radio for everybody today. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  But I didn't want to start there.  Nah.  Well, let's let this guy be a star for a second.  Chris on Long Island.  What's going on, buddy?  Yeah, nothing much.  I listen to Chunky Radio, and it's awful.  He has that t-echoey background with a music bed playing.  Yeah.  And it sucks.  Sam is an ass for liking that shit.  Does he?  Now, are you being sarcastic back to Sam's sarcasm?  No, he really sucks.  It's fucking awful. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  Oh, my God.  I appreciate it.  Sam is a genius, apparently.  All right.  Thank you.  Sam is a genius.  People actually believe.  Sam, why do you like this Chunky Radio?  Well, number one, it plays the music that the kids are listening to, that we're listening to.  It's now.  You're now.  Number two, it's interactive.  So, it's topics you can relate to, and it's stuff you want to hear other people's opinions on.  Look how he says it.  Yeah.  His face is straight. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Well, you ask me a question, and you know.  Shut up.  Are you saying we're just too old to understand what the kids are into these days?  We might not know now.  Into these days.  Well, maybe you want to give Chunky a listen.  We probably should.  I mean, you know what?  Give them a listen, and don't be afraid to learn something.  Yeah.  That's what I would say.  Yeah.  Just listen to them with an open ear.  Are we going to.  So, you want to start with Chunky Radio?  We weren't going to.  Well, you know something? 
[00:08:00]  I really want to hear what has been culled from the program.  Yeah.  And what qualifies as just this fantastic radio.  People are going to be confused by our obsession with Chunky Radio.  Yes.  Why?  Thinking maybe there's a little jealousy in the air here.  Well.  Because we were yanked off the air for programs like Chunky Radio.  Yes.  Yeah.  Does he call Chunky Radio?  Yeah.  He does?  No.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  It's Chunky Radio. 
[00:08:30]  Boy.  It's Chunky Radio, all right.  I'm jealous of his producers.  Chunky, smelly, full of peanuts.  They got to be.  Sounds good, you know.  Top notch, right?  That's how you rate a producer, I think.  Top notch.  Good news for Chunky, too.  His Twitter account is exploding.  Yesterday.  Oh, is it?  Yesterday, he had 24 followers.  Today, he has 244.  All right.  So, he had almost tenfolded.  Yes.  Because Hank Lee, talking about this new technology, like, you know, Chunky was on top of it.  Like, he is on the cutting edge. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's up to 244 followers, and those people get to hear him talking about, you know, walking  up 14 fake flights of stairs.  Fake stairs.  Fake stairs and stuff.  With his fake tiredness.  Unfortunately, him going from 24 followers to 244 followers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of those would be our listeners.  Oh, no.  No.  Yeah.  I thought because of the newspaper thing.  Well, Travis said that we'd be here all day, so he just got the best of the best of some 
[00:09:30]  of the comments left for Chunky Radio on his Twitter account yesterday.  Love to hear some.  This guy's from Canada.  He writes, I'm in Canada, and I know you suck goblin cock.  Oh, imagine that, fat boy.  Pete Rose haircut.  Don't let those O&A assholes bum you out.  You're good at your job, and remember that he loves you. 
[00:10:00]  Praise his name.  Frunkus 316.  Frunkus 316.  What are these dudes?  Pete Rose haircut.  Pete Rose haircut said that.  Cigars and Scotch writes, looking forward to Casey Steakham's Top 40 Obesity Related Medical  Elements Countdown.  This guy's probably looking at his Twitter going, what did I do?  What happened?  What are these dicks?  Wrong place at the wrong time, my friend. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, that's what happened.  He just showed up and punched in.  Oh, radio.  Why does everyone not like me?  You know, he thinks he's a veteran in this business, but he's in the big town now, so  guess what?  Deal with it.  E-Bar 0811.  Stick that Subway sandwich up your fat fucking ass, you fucking phony.  Wow.  Right to the point.  I like that.  I think it's Brucey Poose, P-O-O-S-E.  Bet you wanted to take that horse's cock in your fat ass. 
[00:11:00]  Hack fucking douche.  Do the bit.  Do the bit.  HTLS69, that's his Twitter name, writes, nice fake story about the stairs, fat cunt.  By the way, we could be reading these all day, like I said.  Travis got the best of the best.  So if this is one of yours, then congratulations.  You made the Travis cut.  Hey, I'm on New York radio, finally.  I'll talk about, like, New York, you know, 57th Street, how I dropped my phone. 
[00:11:30]  I'll mention a street in Manhattan so I can kind of blend in.  I think people will like me.  Some horse pee.  Yeah, yeah.  Talk about the horses because they have the horse-drawn carriages.  And then he gets to Twitter about how that horse's cock should be up his fat ass.  You know, I didn't even make that connection.  I was thinking they were just going back to that horse farm video.  I forgot that this is referencing his dumb horse taking a leak in the street, bitch. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fudgy Wudgy Bars, writes, sup, chunky puss.  Fudgy Wudgy Bars.  Uncle Rico, 23, don't bother.  You stink at radio.  Text monster.  You're a disgrace to fat kids everywhere.  I hope you go into a diabetic shock and die.  Jess from Canada writes, sup, fat tits.  What, does he use the word supper a lot?  A lot of kids do.  I mean, that's what...  Well, that's now. 
[00:12:30]  That's the way the kids are talking now.  Sup, guys.  Bill5121 writes, 92.3 now is gayer than five days.  Dicks and one man's ass.  And so are you.  This is my favorite.  It's just, I don't know.  It's so basic, but it just works.  GreenGuy89 writes, how's Twitter working out for you?  Shit dick.  A couple more.  RF Frenchie, liar, liar, pants on fire.  Huge fat people's sweatpants. 
[00:13:00]  Griffith, the horse piss looked like Mountain Dew?  I bet the light posts were made of chocolate.  And the road was paved with gumdrops, you mess.  That's a good one.  That's hilarious.  Oh, and one of the people I follow, Heather Height, she writes, you really wanted that  horse to titty fuck you?  Oh, you really...  No question mark, sorry.  You really wanted that horse to titty fuck you, you fat cunt.  All replies to Chunky Radio on Twitter. 
[00:13:30]  Yes.  He's got 244 followers, setting New York on fire.  He's probably all excited when he saw all the followers, like, wow.  He's probably just like, why is this happening?  I didn't do anything.  It's amazing.  He's a radio douche, so he's thinking, oh, look, it's starting to take off a little.  Look.  Yeah.  My little 20-second, you know, raps between the songs.  Yeah, with the music playing over me.  They're hit with some people, right.  Yuck.  Hey, I want to weave a little bit.  We got the Chunky Radio standing by, but I know that Jimmy and E-Rock went and saw the 
[00:14:00]  Ray Liotta movie, and I mentioned that because Ray's coming in today, which is so cool for  all of us.  I didn't want to go, to be honest with you.  And it's Seth Rogen, right?  Seth Rogen's the star of the movie.  How many fucking movies is this guy going to be in?  I know.  What's her name?  Anna Faris.  Anna Faris, yeah.  She's becoming legit.  She was.  She was kind of that goofy actress in all those.  The scary movie movies.  Yeah, the silly movies, but now she's getting real roles.  I always thought she was cute.  I had therapy at 345, and I had to get my truck in. 
[00:14:30]  I was tired.  I was like, fuck this.  And my girlfriend finally goes, let's just go.  And I didn't want to go, but I'm like, we're interviewing Ray.  I should see this movie.  And E-Rock was gone, which kind of motivated me.  All right, fuck it.  I knew this was not going to be good.  I fucking, I really fucking love this movie.  It was a decent movie.  I howled watching this movie.  Really?  They're fucking, it was, I loved it.  It was so nice to see a comedy that wasn't cute.  It wasn't a goofy comedy.  It was fucking brutal. 
[00:15:00]  Really?  Oh, the language was fucking brutal.  There was violence in it that was brutal.  Oh, nice.  There was fucking face punching and skateboards being broken across fucking heads.  Dude, I fucking laughed out loud a bunch of times watching this movie.  I laughed out loud.  I never laughed out loud in comics.  That's a rousing endorsement.  No kidding.  And Jeffrey Lyons was sitting right in front of me because it was a screener.  Oh, no.  A screening, the critic.  And I guarantee, I might be wrong, but it's almost like I know he probably didn't like it. 
[00:15:30]  And he didn't indicate that he didn't like it.  I couldn't see his face.  But it's almost like it's everything I know.  Like, that's what I like about comedy.  This is what comedy is missing.  It's a brutal, that side of it.  Like, it's like, goofy is fine if you want to bring your 13-year-old.  But I'm fucking 40 years old.  Yeah.  And I don't like that humor.  I don't want cutesy.  This represented the humor I fucking love.  Nice.  Ultra violent and funny.  But, yeah.  With Ray Liotta.  Yeah.  And Seth Rogen.  Liotta's fucking great, dude.  He doesn't even have the funniest role.  Seth Rogen.  I've never watched a full Seth Rogen movie. 
[00:16:00]  I fucking love it.  Even Zack and Miriam I've never seen.  I fucking love Seth Rogen.  He's amazing.  I'm like, I've talked to that guy on the phone.  I should have told him how great he was.  He's ridiculously good, man.  Holy shit, was he funny.  There's a lot of terrorist humor in there, too.  There's this Muslim guy that runs one of those kiosks in the middle of the mall.  And every time he walks past him, he's like, fuck you.  There's a restraining order against him.  And he keeps talking about his terrorist plots to blow up different stores in the mall.  It was Aziz Ansari.  He's a comedian.  He's a nice dude.  He's a comic from New York. 
[00:16:30]  He's, I don't know, he's Indian or he's Arabic or whatever he is.  He must have been in that Adam Sandler movie then.  He's getting a lot of work.  I bet you.  The Zohan or whatever the fuck that movie was.  He's on the new Amy Poehler sitcom I saw.  I think it was.  Yeah, that guy Aziz.  He's got a lot of work.  Yeah.  There's a lot of comedians in it.  Fucking Patton Oswalt has a part.  Brian Posehn, I think, had a little part.  Ooh, he's like nauseous.  Watch all these fucking guys I know and like in the movie.  I fucking hate them.  And you're like, I could have done that role.  I could have done that role.  I was just jealous.  That role was made for me.  I could have been one of the skateboarders who got one broken across the back of his fucking head. 
[00:17:00]  Only you knew to do it with your hands.  Yeah, put them in front of me as I fall into the pavement.  And fucking, what's her name, Anna Faris was great.  Ray Liotta, when Ray Liotta yells at somebody.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, what a fucking psychopath he is.  I really was like, how am I going to spin this where I like this movie?  Because Ray's coming in.  I wouldn't shit on it with Ray Liotta here.  I can't do it.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fucking, I'm so glad I went to see this movie.  What's it called?  I don't even know the name.  Observe and Report.  Observe and Report.  And the one, Seth Rogen lives with his mother. 
[00:17:30]  Oh.  And she plays a, it's just, I can't give away any of the fucking dialogue.  But there's one scene where he's talking to his mom.  And the mom, and he's like getting dressed up for a date.  And the mother goes, you look good.  Like, I remember your father, something like your father dressed up so nicely.  And that first moment when I saw him on our first date, I knew I was going to fuck him.  It was like this brutal fucking dialogue.  That made me laugh.  That's great.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  The mother was a complete drunk.  God damn it.  I love that movie.  He asked, this doesn't give away anything, but he asks about his dad.  And he's like, do you think it was because of me that dad left?  And there's like an emotional pause.  And she reaches out to him.  She goes, yeah, it was all you.  It was great.  Awesome.  Yeah, I recommend it very highly.  And so Ray Liotta's coming in.  I hope Seth Rogen will be in here to promote.  Dude, I'll pick him up at the airport.  I can't believe how much I like Seth Rogen.  I never watched any of his movies.  Snippets.  Go back and see them all.  He's completely taken off. 
[00:18:30]  I don't think he's made a bad movie yet.  That fucker is funny, man.  Jesus Christ, is he funny.  Huge.  He played an over-the-top dick, but it was like, that's what a guy dick is like.  That's what a dickhead dude is like.  There was no, I'm cute, I'm soft and cuddly deep down.  He was just a dick.  It was great.  Well, Liotta's going to be here at 8.30.  Also, Jay Moore's stopping by and John Cena.  Yes.  What time is John Cena?  John is going to be in at 8.  And he's in the paper today because he's basically saying A-Rod should go to jail. 
[00:19:00]  Jesus.  He says, smack Royd user A-Rod in jail, says WWE star.  He thinks if you use steroids, you should go to jail.  There should be.  Actually, he's.  That's insane.  He thinks that there should be laws in place.  It's not a crime.  I know.  That's the problem with his statement.  He thinks that there should have been laws in place and that A-Rod broke this imaginary  law that doesn't exist and he should be in jail.  I couldn't really figure it out myself when I was reading this.  Did he ever.  He never took steroids, John Cena?  No.  He's very sensitive to people using steroids because everybody accuses him of using steroids. 
[00:19:30]  That's a big bastard.  He never took steroids.  Jesus.  Every once in a while, you do get a big bastard that, you know what?  It's just.  Wow.  It's just natural.  How do you compete against a guy like that?  With steroids.  Yeah, exactly.  You cheat.  You need steroids.  We all had one or two of these guys in high school.  It was just how they were fucking made, man.  Boomer Esiason.  Yeah, there you go.  Really fast.  John Cena thinks A-Rod should go to the slammer, because now I need to understand this, for  using steroids.  Steroids are the personal choice of the athlete, says John Cena, currently starring in the film 
[00:20:00]  12 Rounds.  All right.  And Rodriguez got defensive, saying he used because he felt he needed to.  If there was a set of legal stipulations set in place, he may never have even considered  it.  The government should take the initiative, and if you get caught using drugs, then you  should go to jail.  A criminal record will hurt your endorsements and long-term contracts.  Come now, Mr. Cena.  Can't we all just get along?  That's the article.  Wow.  So it's a little weird, because there was no stipulations in place. 
[00:20:30]  Well, we'll have them on.  Yeah, we'll talk more.  Have them clear that up.  Yeah, so some nice guests today.  Jay, John Cena, and Ray Liotta.  Nice.  Mm-hmm.  All right, let's get back to Chunky Radio.  Oh, yeah.  You have audio, Sam?  Yeah, I do.  I was listening last night, as I always do, and I figured I'd run tape this time.  As I always do.  Listen to this fucking idiot.  What else am I going to listen to at night?  When is he on?  From 7 to 11 p.m. here in the East Coast. 
[00:21:00]  Why are we wasting time on a night jock?  I thought he was, like, prime time.  I thought he was afternoon, like, from the story in the paper.  Didn't it say afternoons?  Afternoons is Tic Tac.  Tic Tac and Chunky?  What?  Tic Tac.  You guys don't know Tic Tac?  No.  No.  Maybe we should listen to Tic Tac next.  Not in the now.  Tic Tac.  Tic Tac.  Chunky.  Tic Tac and Chunky.  For the kids.  Fucking candy bar and fucking candy station. 
[00:21:30]  That's wonderful.  Who's in the morning?  Tums?  Peptin AC in the morning.  So what is Chunky working on?  What was he riffing on yesterday?  Well, the beauty of Sam, he gave us a few little things here.  He gave us some Chunky production.  Because every good radio show needs production.  That pew, pew, pew.  It helps introduce the listener.  That way I figure if we play that first, we could all be better introduced to Chunky. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  All righty.  You know, we have that nice Lost production we're doing to start our show, right?  This is what Chunky's doing.  And it's Whip Him Out Wednesday as well.  Chunky's favorite movie, Relate to Female Listener Sweeper.  Yes.  Relate to Female Listener Sweeper.  Did you dub it that, Sam?  I did write that.  Ah, you, you, okay.  I was wondering if maybe that was, like, elaborated on.  Chunky, for some reason, wanted me to tell you that he cried during The Notebook and P.S. I Love You. 
[00:22:30]  It's Chunky.  92, 3.  Now, FM.  I'm scared.  Bells!  Bells!  Bells!  Bells!  Bells!  Bells!  Bells!  Rubbish!  Filth!  Slime!  Muck!  What's that? 
[00:23:00]  Princess Bride.  Ah, it's good.  It is good.  Oh, my God.  That, uh, oh, hockey fight last night, huh?  Yeah, there was a rare hockey fight last night.  Yeah.  Wow, look at that.  The gloves come off.  Was that Avery, though?  Why don't they finish showing the...  Oh, God.  Fucking Avery.  That's what we want to see.  Sean Avery jump-started the damn Rangers out of nowhere.  Oh, but I love that guy.  Sean Avery rules.  Chunky.  And he's on, sorry. 
[00:23:30]  You hate hockey talk.  Nah, I don't mind hockey talk, but it's Chunky.  He's just one of those old school players.  That's all I want to say.  Old school hockey.  And he's, you know, I hate the Rangers.  I'm an Island fan, but I love that Avery.  All right, Chunky Sweeper with a fat joke.  What's this about there, Sam?  What?  One of the things I...  Self-deprecating fat joke?  That's what I...  So he's hiding his misery of being a slob behind a little bit of humor?  Is that what he does?  Oh, I'm sure he loves reading those Twitters about what a fat fuck he is.  Oh, that's got a heart. 
[00:24:00]  Jesus.  Just a fun guy who likes to have a good time.  Jolly, fat, jolly fat man.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm glad to know they're moving on at our old joint with this crap.  The only radio disc jockey that sweats ranch dressing.  Chunky Radio TV.  Now, FM.  FM, fat motherfucker.  He sweats ranch dressing.  Ranch dressing.  See, because he's so fat. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  He's a bigger guy.  Oh, God.  But, I mean, you can make those jokes.  If everybody's having a good time, like, no feelings get hurt.  No.  Shut up.  So far, he's relating to the female listening.  He's doing that self-deprecating humor.  Yeah.  And then, of course, you need some kind of sweeper that makes you feel like you're part of the local scene, man.  Oh, no.  Where is he from?  New York, now.  Okay, look.  Where is he from?  Well, the last job was Detroit. 
[00:25:00]  All right, Detroit.  And I'm sure when he was in Detroit, he was all about Detroit.  That was then.  He's probably a Tigers fan.  Oh, I'm sure.  Went to the Lions games.  Auburn's, what's it called?  The Palace in Auburn's Hills?  Yeah.  Yeah, now he's New York.  He's all about the Big Apple now, right?  Now.  He thinks the Statue of Liberty looks like his ex-girlfriend.  It's Chunky.  On 92.3.  Now, FM.  Oh, what a ham-handed fucking attempt to be local. 
[00:25:30]  Who the fuck is writing these lines?  Why does she look like his ex-girlfriend?  She has a lot of men inside of her.  I guarantee that our listeners could write better Chunky lines within seconds.  You know what it should be?  Who's writing this shit?  Oh, no.  It's Chunky.  It's Chunky.  Chunky's here.  Oh, hide your lunch.  He's fat.  Chunky's coming up the stairwell. 
[00:26:00]  If you want to be local, how about Chunky thinks his ex-girlfriend's pussy smells like Staten Island?  92.3 now.  Somebody should Twitter some lines to help him out at least.  Yes, help him.  Yeah, help out the Chunkster.  Yeah.  Well, now we go into actual Chunky breaks.  Yeah, what...  Ah, here's what we're waiting for.  Between the songs, you know, you're listening to some of what's now, you know, your favorite songs.  Your favorites.  And Chunky will do, like, little thought starters.  Uh-huh.  And you can call or text or whatever and just contribute your own opinions on whatever Chunky might feel like talking about that day. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  By the way, someone makes a good point.  They hung up.  For him to sweat ranch dressing, he would actually need to eat a sour.  That's true.  Great line.  The guy couldn't wait around.  So, whoever you are, bravo.  All right.  A bunch of dicks to listen to.  They rule.  That's why you want them on your side.  Jesus.  So, we set this up nice?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:00]  Ready to hit?  Oh, yeah.  I just Chunky...  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Listen to that bed.  It's a bass...  It's like you're trying to listen to somebody when one of those cars used to drive up next  to you.  Right.  And that isn't too now.  Whoa.  With a vibrating fucking car would pull up next to you and you can't hear shit.  Yeah.  That's what Chunky's using as a bed.  The music's just there to let you know the party hasn't stopped just because... 
[00:27:30]  You know what I mean?  Like, we're still going.  We're still moving.  Ha ha.  You're gonna make a great PD someday.  Yeah.  With your bullshit.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, yeah.  Hi, this is Chunky Radio, 92.3 Now FM.  Ha ha.  The phone number is 866-990-4487.  Ladies, today just feels like one of those days for ladies where your boyfriend could do  nothing right. 
[00:28:00]  I've seen a lot of domestics going on on 57th Street today.  Today must have been that day where men did nothing right.  So, I want you to call in right now, 866-990-4487.  That's weird, because we walk up and down 57th Street, too, and I didn't see not one big  slap yesterday.  Let me explain something.  We've walked up 57th for years now.  Every single day.  I've never seen a domestic...  Is he saying domestic violence? 
[00:28:30]  He said it was all over 57th Street yesterday, Jimmy.  People work on 57th Street.  Right.  It's not couples strolling hand-in-hand on 57th.  How about 110th Street?  Then I'd believe you.  Yeah, then I'd believe you.  Jimmy makes a really good point, because if you want to be part of the New York culture,  and you're mentioning 57th Street, everybody knows that it's a working midtown area with  a lot of just office buildings, and a lot of women in pantsuits, and guys in their suits,  and that's it.  You don't see, like you guys said, the couple thing. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Whatsoever.  It's not a stroll down, like it's not Central Park South, or anywhere by going into the  park, or anywhere where there's couples strolling downtown.  And he's got the whole city to choose from.  He goes, all you have to do is say the Upper West Side, the Upper East Side.  It's not Delancey.  Right.  Somewhere where people might be, yeah, going to a club or something.  Holy fucking shut up, you fat ass.  It's like moving to L.A., right? 
[00:29:30]  And going, wow, my house on Sunset Strip.  The Sunset Strip.  You know, I was hanging out at Hollywood and Vine.  I was at the Brown Derby.  Wow.  Died in the whole local, aren't you?  How bad do you want to be local?  My God.  Well, I know.  Shut up.  Stop it.  And stop trying to tie it into something that doesn't exist.  They have to be pounding him.  You idiot.  You don't climb stairs.  Yeah.  And bitches aren't getting slapped on 57th Street. 
[00:30:00]  Shut up.  They must be pounding him.  You gotta get local.  Yeah.  Forget about the past.  You're New York now.  So just when you say something, just add a local twist, a street, a landmark.  You could do the same story, but just localize it.  Shut up.  Did nothing right.  So I want you to call in right now, 866-990-4487.  I want you to tell me why your boyfriend is about to get dumped. 
[00:30:30]  He's on the verge of getting dumped.  Why is he about to get dumped?  If you could give him a little warning sign, let him know he's about to get dumped.  Maybe he'll shape up.  You could text me at 69923.  Call Chunky Radio right now and let me know why your man is about to get dumped.  And he hit the post.  Maybe you see that?  He hit the post.  Yes, he did.  As he was playing the bed over the music, which just was neck-twistingly bad. 
[00:31:00]  I was just him farting through the entire break.  Just making some room for dinner, aren't you, fatso?  Come up with a different street, too.  You made a 57th Street reference yesterday.  Oh, did he?  Everything happens on 57th Street.  Yeah, he did.  Where did he see the horse?  Wasn't it around 57th Street?  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, there are no horses on 57th Street. 
[00:31:30]  They never take those handsome cabs down.  They cross over 57th, sometimes down Broadway.  You guys don't understand, though.  If you're as fat as Chunky, the area you could move within is a mere couple of blocks.  That's it.  So to him, the whole world is 57th Street.  He works there.  He works on 57th, so it's all 57th.  I live, work, and play on 57th Street.  And all we heard about was local content. 
[00:32:00]  Local, local, local, local.  And we gave them their local.  Yep.  And we did what, you know...  God, this is disgusting.  It'll fail miserably.  They're going to get a nice popular ratings because they're doing 10,000 songs in a row.  Yeah.  So...  Shut up, Sam.  Commercial free.  Sam, just the way he says, yeah.  Like, yeah, I'm digging it.  That is going to drop like a rock in the Hudson.  In the Hudson River.  Oh, man.  Oh, shit. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, slow down, Chunky.  At 57th Street.  Yes, 57th and the Hudson.  That's it.  Can we get that bit?  I want to do it all day.  Yeah.  I want to talk over that and just yell like Chunky Radio was.  All right.  You talk, I'll do the big...  Ah, yeah.  We're on 57th Street.  I'm looking out the window and wow, what's going on here?  It's like a big New York thing going on. 
[00:33:00]  Plink, plink, plink.  I can't wait until the 4th of July for the fireworks display out on 57th Street.  No, idiot.  All right.  Here we go.  Chunky's...  I like reading what Sam writes down for his tracks.  It's half the beauty of this bit.  Of course.  Sam writes, Chunky's guy on the couch reads...  Wait.  He's got someone called guy on the couch?  Those are quotation marks.  Oh, no.  He's like, those are quotation marks. 
[00:33:30]  I apologize, Sam.  Yes.  Chunky's guy on the couch reads text messages that are definitely not fake.  Yes.  Which means they're absolutely fake.  All right.  In Sam's peak, what that means is there's a lame guy on the couch.  I guess they saw a couch in there and figured, we can make a character called guy on the couch.  Wow.  That's terrific.  They just look at anything.  Oh, God.  If only somebody was sitting on the shitter at the time.  We'll call you guy on the shitter. 
[00:34:00]  And he's reading texts that definitely aren't fake.  Right.  Which in Sam's peak, I believe, means these could not be more fake.  And then he continues.  He writes, then Chunk takes a live, in quotes, phone call.  Oh, no.  And let me explain a little something to people in radio land.  When you're running a show where you are so music intensive, you get to talk for 10 seconds at a clip. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  The odds that you're going to plunk a phone line down and get gold is astronomical.  So what you do is you record all of your calls.  Right.  And then make believe you're just taking that call at that moment.  Right.  Because, like I said, there's no way you would hit the phones.  Every phone call is golden.  Right.  We have a professional screener.  Yeah.  That screens you.  And you all stink.  And then we put the best on. 
[00:35:00]  Or we try to.  Yeah.  So we have a massive screening process.  We take them live.  But, you know.  But we work on the fly better than, I mean, more than anyone out there.  Yeah.  And we still are screening calls.  Because you'd be here all day plunking down phone lines to just idiots, morons, people  that have no concept of how to speak on the phone, never mind the radio.  And Chunk, the Chunk is just plunking down phones and it's gold, right?  Can we call him the Chunkster?  The Chunkster?  Yeah.  The Chunkster has great callers, though, because they talk fast, they get right to 
[00:35:30]  the point, and they're in, they're out.  It's real.  Boom, boom, boom.  And they're requesting a song that just happens to be playing in the background on the phone  call.  Jesus.  And also, they're good with the beep button.  Yeah.  They beep out those curse words in those live phone calls.  Like, nothing.  Hey, I was doing that for years over there.  What are you saying, Sam?  I don't know how they do it so fast.  All right.  Brian and Jersey, we were mistaken.  And Chunky dropped his phone on 57th Street, too. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, okay.  So this is the third reference to 57th Street.  How about another street?  Right.  How about you go into, I don't know, 56th?  Where does he live in?  The Carnegie Hall basement?  Make a right out of the door and go to 56th.  Yeah, there's a breezeway.  You can go right or left.  Yeah, right or left.  Why don't you go exploring 56th Street?  Yeah.  There's a bum over there that's a little ornery.  It's easy.  That might bite your face off.  The streets work in a grid, so you can't really get lost.  Jesus.  And then Sam ends with, then Chunk takes a, quote, live phone call, ending, and he has 
[00:36:30]  to write it in all caps with a hilarious punchline.  It's important.  It's now.  You have to end with a punchline.  All righty.  That way, people want to come back for the next one.  I want to know, why is your boyfriend...  What does Chunk need to know?  What does Chunk need to know?  What does he need to know?  Needs to know the cholesterol in everything he eats. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  Holy shit.  The...  It's so loud.  It's so loud.  It's so loud.  It's so fucking annoyingly loud.  He's yelling at me.  I want to know, why is your boyfriend about to get dumped?  Your chance to kind of send him a wake-up call, tell him to wake up, ship up or...  This guy...  Ship up?  Ship up or shape out?  Also...  Ship up.  He said ship up.  Yes, he did. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  The Chunkster is a traitor, man.  He's working for the other team.  What do you mean?  He's working with the women.  I know.  Hey, we want to know what's wrong with those guys out there.  Come on, bitches.  Call in.  Let's ignore that I'm a guy.  Well, the station does want to kind of target the female listener.  Yeah.  That's why.  We were promptly shown the door.  We were getting...  I want to know, why is your boyfriend...  What?  ...about to get dumped?  Your chance to kind of send him a wake-up call, tell him to wake up, ship up or shape 
[00:38:00]  out.  Guy on the couch, what do we got on the text over there?  I know why he's about to get dumped, because he doesn't take me out.  That is from Ashley.  Yes, fellas, you got to take your girls out.  What else you got?  My man is getting dumped because he cheated on me with his first cousin.  She has an STD.  We've been going out for three years.  Dude!  That's a hysterical cowhead.  He's got a dumb Rocco.  He's Rocco.  He's got a little Rocco out. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, guy on the couch.  Hey, guy on the couch that likes his face smushed into it.  A guy biting the pillow on the couch.  Guy on the couch doesn't sound like he's from New York.  No.  Does he bring up a 57th Street reference?  He has one thoroughfare in Manhattan.  Christopher Street for the one.  Everything else is bedrock.  Right.  It's one street, 57th.  Right.  Yeah, the Ice Age is still taking care of Manhattan. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Ah, dude.  Dude, right?  An STD, dude.  Rocco is the king of punching up the lamest shit, man.  With his fat boy laugh.  Oh, dude.  You didn't say that.  No, it's crazy.  Jesus Christ.  What a fucking train wreck. 
[00:39:30]  We were replaced by this shit?  Ugh.  Sounds like Frankie Blue without the alcohol.  No, Frankie Blue was a classic, man.  Frankie Blue was great drunk.  He wanted to fuck his listeners.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, who doesn't?  But, I mean, he openly said it on his show.  That's crazy.  50 grand prize winners.  50 grand prize winners.  RuPaul's big man hands.  Yeah.  Is that the RuPaul's hands?  Yeah.  Dude, where is E-Rock? 
[00:40:00]  Have we played that in a while, E-Rock?  Frankie Blue.  If E-Rock could prove that we haven't played that in 90 days,  we are playing that today.  Frankie Blue, have we played it, please?  E-Rock?  I got my fingers crossed.  The last time we played it was on Christmas Day.  Uh-oh.  January, February.  We can play it, but almost 90 days.  Oh, thanks.  We're not past the 90 days.  Wait a minute, Maup.  What's today's date?  25th.  We're on fucking 90 days exactly. 
[00:40:30]  There you go.  Frankie Blue, baby!  Frankie Blue.  And who listens on Christmas anyway, right?  Yeah, no one was listening.  What are you kidding?  We could have had RuPaul in, and none of us thought of it.  That would have been great to ask RuPaul about the whole Frankie Blue experience.  About Frankie Blue.  Get that Frankie Blue shit.  That fucking tranny wouldn't have fessed up with shit.  Maybe not.  We're going to play Frankie Blue, and then we're going to play part two of the Chunky stuff.  But first, let's get back to Guy on the Couch.  Guy on the Couch.  Yeah, dude!  What, is he collecting the info for Chunky? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, he's getting a text.  He's just some dumb intern.  I've been going out for three years.  All right, once again, 866-990-4487.  Why is your man about to get dumped?  Because he doesn't have a job.  Dude, that's the best.  He can sit at home and make you dinner all night.  No, he doesn't even know how to cook.  Okay, are you dating a homeless guy?  No, I'm not.  You don't have to give this guy 25 cents every night when you come home, do you? 
[00:41:30]  No, I have to give him a dollar.  New York's 93.3 now, FM.  That was so funny.  Doesn't it just infuriate you?  Yeah!  It is.  It's angeringly mad.  Bad.  That fucking bad, she says something, bam, hit the fucking production.  Did you notice him bring down the bed so he could get... 
[00:42:00]  You dating a homeless guy?  Yeah.  And then bring the bed right back out?  Yeah, I got back to...  This is why I can't sleep at night, because...  Because you're up all night, Winston?  Yeah, me too.  Because there's corporate suits that just believe in this.  What is that?  Like, I can't...  I know this is for females and stuff, but you like to think the females deserve a little  more than this from their stupid radio show.  Wouldn't they want, like, a Ryan Seacrest instead of a big, fat, chunky fuck? 
[00:42:30]  Ryan Seacrest is on Z100.  Please.  Please.  Please.  I'd rather have a lope-weiser.  And you know how much I hate lope-weisers.  One more.  Chunky displays his undying wit by over-explaining a self-deprecating joke.  Undying wit.  Fucking Sam. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  The bed?  All right.  Let's go to the funds.  Your man's about to get...  Oh, God.  Stop with the bed.  Stop with the bed.  Can we please get that bass line so we can have that?  Oh, I want that.  Yeah.  I want to talk over it all day and just have to yell until you're fucking hoarse.  Oh, my God.  This is why...  Wow.  This is why I'm going insane.  Oh, my God.  Is he homeless?  Like, on 57th Street?  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Why would he be...  He can't cook.  So, is he homeless?  No.  She said he's out of work.  He's at her...  He's at home.  He's not homeless.  And why, if you can't cook, would you need...  I don't get what he said!  Homeless people don't have ovens.  It's angering.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's just play it.  I mean, there's some wit to be heard here.  All right.  Let's go to the funds.  Your man's about to get dumped.  Why?  It's not true anymore about... 
[00:44:00]  It's not the size of the ocean.  It's all about the motion.  Right, but didn't you know this before you started dating him?  Yeah, but he promised he would get better, but it never got better.  Are we dating?  That sounds awfully like me.  Probably.  I'm really bad in the bed.  Oh, boy.  You get it?  Oh, boy.  She just said, oh, boy.  He's not good in bed.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  He said, the bed.  The bed.  So, yeah.  And the bed's not good either.  You know what?  And here's another thing they told him.  Look.  A lot of guys are going to be calling up.  Keep them off the air.  You give subjects.  You give topics that are going to get the girls calling in.  Because we want a female presence here.  So, get the girls calling.  Get them involved.  And that way more girls come on board. 
[00:45:00]  Don't worry.  The guys will be there.  Don't worry about it.  They're going to be there just to hear the chunk.  The chunkster.  The chunkster.  Tic Tac always gets the girls to call in, too.  Ah.  Does he?  Can we hear Tic Tac?  How do you know that, Sam?  What am I going to listen to in the afternoons?  Ron and Fez?  No, I mean after three.  Noon to three, Ron and Fez.  How about a replay of our show?  I heard it already.  No, it's now.  It's now.  It's now.  Not then.  Yeah.  You're then.  I need now. 
[00:45:30]  Fuck you.  This is.  It's amazing how awful it is.  Un-fucking-listenable.  Yeah.  That's bad.  It's unlistenable bad.  And completely listenable on this show.  Because I can't get enough of hearing that shit.  It's all I want to hear.  Do you want to say, I want every break to start with that bass line.  Yeah.  Every break.  We got four more tracks after the break.  Thank God.  But we're going to start with Frankie Blue after the break. 
[00:46:00]  Have to.  Frankie Blue, 50 grand.  Prize winner.  It's one of our favorite audio clips of all time.  Frankie Blue.  When he mixes up the 50 grand prize winners to 50 grand prize winner.  Like, he didn't know if it was a grand prize or if it was 50 grand prize winner.  He was so confused.  I don't know what happened that day.  Maybe he had the flu. 
[00:46:30]  Nah.  We could talk about the rumors.  That's for sure.  Oh, rumors.  You could get witnesses.  What is the fat chunky sweeper?  It's for afters.  Fans made them.  Fans are making chunky sweepers?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  We didn't even ask for chunky sweepers.  Oh, the fans rule.  All right.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll do the Frankie Blue.  Then part two of the chunky audio for today.  Tomorrow, we're going to get some Tic Tac audio.  Yeah, we can listen to Tic Tac tomorrow.  You guys are going to get so jealous. 
[00:47:00]  So you're going to get down on yourselves.  Shut the fuck up.  You're the worst.  Sam is the worst, man.  And happy birthday to old fatso, Aretha Franklin, 67 today.  Oh, and those wacky Japanese.  What are they up to now?  I'll explain after the break.  We're going to do a little weaving in and out today.  We're going to do some more chunky stuff and some current stuff. 
[00:47:30]  Because we have to be now, too, Sam.  Chunky is now.  Chunky is now.  We go now sometimes.  All right.  And then let's not forget, Jay Moore coming in today.  John Cena coming in today.  And Ray Liotta from the movie that Jimmy saw last night that he thought was great.  Observe and Report.  Fucking hilarious comedy, man.  Ultra violent and very funny.  But funny violence.  I honestly got it, man.  I was like, how am I going to fucking say this nicely with Ray in studio?  Because I wouldn't have bashed it with him here.  I would have bashed it before he got here.  But not when he was here. 
[00:48:00]  But I honestly, man, I love this fucking movie.  It really made me laugh.  He does these impersonations.  You think it was the real people.  I really fucking laughed.  You got to listen to Jeff for a second.  Jeff.  Hey, guys.  Welcome aboard.  Anthony made the comment, this is unlistenable.  Yeah.  You guys are making us listen to this stupid ass.  Yeah.  See, I said it's unlistenable and completely listenable.  See, that's.  He didn't get it. 
[00:48:30]  That's.  Wow.  I think I got one of Chunky's listeners.  Maybe he should go over there and listen to the great female callers.  Do we have to explain the beauty of the thing is that it's so bad that it's listenable?  That it's.  Yeah.  You got to.  With our comments.  And Sam's sarcasm.  Sarcasm.  And us.  Yeah.  I think we should just play the clips.  They stand on their own.  Yeah.  Unlike Chunky.  He can't.  He's.  Some kind of fucking scaffolding.  You got to handle a guy like Jeff with humor when he calls up. 
[00:49:00]  You got to go.  Hey, Jeff.  Why don't you find yourself a short pier and fucking mutter on the end of it?  Jimmy didn't go local.  Take a long walk.  Why don't you go to the Chelsea piers?  No.  Too far.  57th Street.  57th Street, Jimmy.  The end of 57th Street.  You can find some kind of pier.  Yes.  If you walk down 57th.  Now, this is way far away from where Chunky has ventured.  And you cross over the West Side Highway.  Right.  You will fall into the Hudson.  And there might just be an old pier. 
[00:49:30]  So, he could take a long walk off 57th Street.  Right.  Not even a pier.  Right.  Walk right off and fall off.  That's what I say.  We'll return.  Thank God.  Thank God.  What's up, everybody?  Thank you for listening to us.  We appreciate it. 
[00:50:00]  We're getting a new music bed.  We should have it in a minute or two.  Oh, thank God.  I cheated and heard it.  I've got to be honest.  It's a fucking winner.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We need one.  We need one like the Chunkster.  Yes.  In about an hour, Jay Moore will be walking through that door.  Also, John Cena from the WWE.  Is he the current champion?  I would have to ask Sam.  He's a friend of ours.  Why don't we know this stuff? 
[00:50:30]  No.  Look at Sam.  He's running in.  Sam, a big day for you.  He's shaking that frigging bush on his head.  No.  Look at you with all the air time today.  What do you know on John Cena?  John Cena, he's wrestling at WrestleMania for the world title.  Against who?  Edge and the Big Show.  Edge and the Big Show.  Three-way dance.  Who's got the title right now?  John Cena, of course.  Edge does.  Who's got the title right now?  Edge?  Yeah.  So why's the Big Show thrown into this?  There's a whole love triangle going on with Vicky Guerrero.  You didn't know about this? 
[00:51:00]  Oh, I did.  No, it slipped my mind.  Is Vicky the one that was in here?  No.  Vicky Guerrero is Eddie Guerrero's widow.  Right.  We don't know shit.  Married to Edge.  Right.  And having an affair with the Big Show.  Right.  Which John Cena exposed.  Hence the triple threat match.  Hence the three-way triple threat match for the belt.  Right.  Yeah.  Who's suspicious that the Big Show might be, you know.  Might be what?  Having sex with Vicky.  Well, John Cena knows the guy who operates the security cameras. 
[00:51:30]  So he found a security tape.  Oh, shit.  No, he didn't.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  Big Show and Vicky talking about their animalistic urges for one another.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  Damn.  Well, that's what you need in the ring is not only professionalism, but then some animosity.  Right.  So it's a pretty heated battle.  That sounds like it.  Yeah.  We'll find out more from John Cena.  Yes.  Woo.  Good luck to everyone.  Woo.  Woo.  Oh, and then we just got a, what, a Britney Spears review from someone that can't go on 
[00:52:00]  the air?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  She lip synced her.  Lip synced the entire, apparently, lip synced the entire show, including the one time, because  she doesn't interact with the audience.  Right.  I guess because that's always proved to be disastrous for her.  She actually, it's pre-recorded her chit chat with the audience.  Right.  And the only thing she actually says live is like, hello, NASA Coliseum. 
[00:52:30]  Coliseum.  Unbelievable.  Sounds great.  And then instead of dancing, because I guess, I guess, because she's really not in the shape  she used to be in.  No, not yet.  And even when she was in great shape, she would be huffing and puffing so badly between songs  that it would be obvious she was lip syncing, because no one, you can't even talk when you're  and then she breaks into this perfect song that's recorded perfectly.  Uh, so now they seem to wheel, you know, when the bell hop comes down with that rack that 
[00:53:00]  he puts your bags on and wheels into the elevator, apparently they have some production number  where she's just being wheeled around on stage on that waving one side of the stage.  And then she'll kick her leg up a little as they're wheeling her around on the stage.  What a fucking lazy performer, man.  What a fucking, music, I mean, it's like rock singers, it's like fucking belted out their  own shit.  I hate these lip syncing people.  Don't do concerts.  No.  You can't sing live. 
[00:53:30]  Even if Ozzy stinks live.  So what?  And I say that with love.  His voice cracks.  Who gives a shit?  People want to see it.  That's what you see.  You're watching a guy sing live.  And I would rather see that than listen to the fucking record.  So sick of it.  I like when guys, like Robert Plant, can't hold the same notes he used to hold.  Who cares?  I'd rather see him fucking bellowing through that than fucking, you know, lip syncing  old Zeppelin.  Can you imagine going to a whole lot of love?  Yeah.  Can you imagine going to like, I don't know, a U2 show and Bono's lip syncing?  Ugh.  What? 
[00:54:00]  Or Mick Jagger.  He runs around.  Mick Jagger puts on one of the best stage shows as far as a front man is concerned.  Mick Jagger's a fucking animal.  He really is an animal.  Well, I hear he has like exercise equipment backstage.  Yep.  I heard that too.  At the Orpium, they said he had the small theater tour.  It's not good enough that he's running around on stage for three hours.  He's like on the treadmill or whatnot before the show.  Yep.  Just to get himself, his heart racing and get in shape.  He's insane.  Yeah.  He's an animal.  Slow down, man.  He has kind of taken to the Bob Dylan, I can't understand what the fuck you're saying 
[00:54:30]  though, kind of thing.  I'm old.  I'm old.  I'm old.  I'm old.  I'm old.  I'm old.  I'm old.  I'm old.  I'm old.  Yeah, thank you.  Like, he's jumping around.  He's, you know, putting on a show.  But it's this monotone kind of just trailing off at the end vocals.  With his eyes wide open and his lips hanging open.  Yeah, exactly.  It's all right.  Stones or Beatles?  Let's go around the room.  Well, it was the Stones for me because Beatles were a little too, you know, my mom and dad. 
[00:55:00]  Beatles.  Love the Stones.  But the Stones.  Every time.  But even the Stones were a little too much.  I was more like the Who.  I was the Who kind of guy.  Yeah.  70s Who.  But you know what?  Stones, stop after Tattoo You.  After?  I mean, before.  I mean, wait.  Now, no.  Tattoo You is the cutoff, right?  You like that one, man?  Tattoo You was all right. 
[00:55:30]  After that, it got a little.  The wheels started coming off.  You know why I picked the Beatles?  Because the Beatles were so.  They were brilliant content wise.  Like what they wrote about was.  The lyrics were great.  And they were.  They were so different from like.  She loves to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that was drugs.  Yeah, exactly.  It was the dope.  But they were just.  They were a little too poppy for me.  You listen to the Beatles.  You're like, oh, yeah, that was a great one.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking.  Rain.  Which one's that?  Beatles.  Rain.  I don't know that song. 
[00:56:00]  I like to get a little obscure with my Beatles.  Dude, I'm a huge.  I'm just like a fucking hits guy.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  On cue.  This is Chunky Radio.  Here's Rain by the Beatles.  I don't like the rain.  The Beatles had so many fucking songs.  That was ridiculous.  It's just that you could still hear songs that you never heard before from those sons of bitches.  Dude, A Day in the Life. 
[00:56:30]  Like what a fucking great tune that is.  They're just fucking great.  Yeah, they did kind of really go from that whole bubble gummy kind of yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  I want to hold your hand to just drug induced rock that, you know, still holds up.  Fucking fucked up.  I don't like it.  There's people that don't like the Beatles, but I hate people who hate the Beatles.  Like, dude, the Beatles sucked.  It's like, shut up.  Gotta be different, guy.  You're an ass.  Gotta be different, guy.  Yeah, they're terrible. 
[00:57:00]  You're right.  You're so right, Jimmy.  You're so right, Jimmy.  Fuck up.  You gotta appreciate what they did.  My God.  It all starts with them.  Everyone across the...  It's funny.  I've asked Lemmy.  I've asked Ozzy.  I've asked a lot of hard rockers.  Every one of them says that.  Yeah.  The Beatles.  Like, Lemmy said that.  The greatest fucking world band of all time.  You know, it's like, they all love the fucking Beatles.  And that's why...  Then he fell down drunk.  Of course he did.  He said that he was just passed out, vomiting.  That's why you can't do the Beatles-Stones comparison, because the Beatles were only around  for what?  Six years, something like that?  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Stones are going on 80?  Bash to you!  No!  Don't lose the goo, yeah!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  You only know the song by the fucking pitch and tone of words.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh!  Oh!  I think that's good.  My Clue!  Moving on, because we've got the Frankie Blue, and then part two of Chunky Radio for everybody.  The Red Doe won't paint the blue.  The Colors in the blue won't paint the blue. 
[00:58:00]  I try.  I try.  And I try.  And I try.  I think it can't go.  Well, I think it can't go.  Da-da-da-da.  When I'm watching, watching me.  And a man comes on to tell me.  I wipe my shorts from bed.  But he came to be a man, cause he does not move.  If the scene's ever at the move. 
[00:58:30]  Move!  I got it, dude!  And he's just sprinting back and forth on the stage.  Dude, this motherfucker is in shape.  Yes, he is.  Sprinting past the Crypt Keeper playing guitar.  Cigarette hanging out of his mouth.  Smoke coming out of his eyeball holes.  If you look at Keith Richards, he actually has a metal stick in his back like a mannequin.  He's got an alien's body.  Oh, he's a wreck. 
[00:59:00]  Some shots of him.  Ah, very good.  Da-da-da!  You're giving Bobo a new impression.  You know that.  Ah, who could dare to dream.  I want to hear that one.  Enjoy your new impression, cause he's gonna steal it and make it his own.  Bobo's gonna steal Bobo.  Stupid Bobo.  Do we have any of his Springsteen?  Bobo, why would you do that, Bobo?  I think Derek's making a production piece out of it.  Come on, Bobo, why are you doing that, Bobo?  Tell me, Bobo.  Tell us, Bobo.  People want to know, Bobo.  Jersey.  Jersey.  I went on the parkway in Jersey, and I drove the car, and I was with Wendy. 
[00:59:30]  God damn it, that's good.  It's the worst.  He's my favorite.  Fucking Bobo.  Bobo.  Hey, Japanese astronaut testing stink-free underwear.  There's a lot going on in the news today.  Everything's about their fucking poopy hole.  I know.  Everything over there is about their fucking poopy hole. 
[01:00:00]  Stink free so they can wear them on their faces.  Creeps.  They are creepy, huh?  What the fuck?  They're not happy unless a woman with fucking crumpled feet is crying with duty on her head.  The old shithead.  Can you give me a shithead video tonight?  Just pop a shithead video.  Thank you, sir.  Houston.  Teenage boys, are you tired of embarrassing questions about when you last changed underwear? 
[01:00:30]  What?  Houston.  Like, instead of Houston, we have a problem.  Houston.  Japan's space scientists may have just the answer.  A line of odor-free underwear and casual clothing.  They've combined shit and dessert.  So this way it doesn't linger in your underpants.  Or you have, after you have a fish, or you have a sheet with sprinkle on it.  It looks like Koichi Wakata.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  Hey!  I didn't say that like it's a Japanese name, though.  No.  How would you say the Wakata part is a Japanese?  Wakata!  There you go.  The first Japanese astronaut to live on the International Space Station is testing the clothes called J-wear.  He could wear his trunks more than a week.  Ah!  Jesus.  Fucking change.  What are you, in a bottle rocket?  Fucking change them!  Is underwear that much of a hassle that you have to deal with this?  Wakata's clothes, developed by researcher Yoshiko, are designed to kill bacteria, absorb water, insulate the body, and dry quickly. 
[01:01:30]  They also are flame-resistant and anti-static.  So you need to have to eating some of that Szechuan.  Flame-resistant.  Not to mention, comfortable and stylish.  Japanese astronaut, oh boy.  Takawa Dwa, gave the clothes a trial run during a shuttle mission last year, even after a vigorous workout.  Oh, God.  You know, come on. 
[01:02:00]  You know, if they really want to test this underwear, they should get Tub Girl involved.  Yeah, she probably is.  She's head of the space program over there.  That's what she was doing on her fucking head.  She was launching.  Launching rockets.  That was her first failed attempt.  She needed to fucking, to break the sound barrier and clear the atmosphere, and she only got it 11 inches.  Are you a miss?  By 200 miles.  In the face.  Yes.  They're coming back down on face.  Gravity, no good.  I bet you she's on the space station, and she shoots it out, and then her duty floats forever, and they love it. 
[01:02:30]  They can't get enough shit in that country.  Jesus Christ.  That's what happens when you nuke a people.  Yes, what is it?  Jesus.  They love the shit.  They love it.  If it's not coming out of their assholes, they don't want to acknowledge it.  Oh, man.  Well, this guy worked out on the space shuttle, and then guess what?  His underwear stayed dry, so that's terrific.  The Japanese space agency plans to make the clothes available to NASA and its other space station partners once developed. 
[01:03:00]  Development is complete.  A commercial line is also in the offering.  Hey, is it charcoal stuff, do you think?  Is charcoal supposed to do that?  Yeah, I'm sure.  I don't know.  Charcoal filter, like Tarryton.  You probably got to plug it in.  It's fucking like a little fan that blows your asshole dry.  That's what it is.  And it's a cork in the underwear that goes in your ass and shit doesn't come out.  Then you pull them down and fuck a mechanical girl that you built.  Yeah.  What the fuck is with them?  You put a little plaid fucking schoolgirl dress on and make it go teeheeheeheehee. 
[01:03:30]  It's a robot with a mullet.  I'm going to fuck it.  It will cry.  It has metal tears.  They are backwards, huh?  Just a weird...  Jimmy said it years ago.  It's this whole mindset of a defeated people, like the Germans.  You look at the Axis powers from World War II and look at how they've progressed over the years.  And the perversion that goes on, and I'm not saying it's everybody, but Jesus Christ, when you become known for a certain thing, like when you have German shit videos and German chicken fucking videos, there was a problem there. 
[01:04:00]  There was a problem.  I don't think they were doing that, you know, pre-1945.  No.  Of course they weren't.  I don't think they were fucking chickens.  They were nice.  They ran around with flowers on their dress.  Oh!  The ladies were nice, holding the fucking flower print dresses and handing your shit.  Walking on those little stupid wooden shoes. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, little rotten feet.  Yeah.  Their feet all look like seahorse bodies.  Hey, you have to bind them.  I wonder if they come in sweatpants.  I can use a pair of these.  Yeah, you want the sweatpants ones?  You just wear that for a week straight.  Just blast in them.  Not have to worry.  Well, congratulations to them for that.  You want to do Frankie Blue?  You want to do a little more Chunky Radio?  Dude.  Frankie Blue?  Either one.  I want to hear a little Frankie.  Frankie Blue is the greatest DJ fuck-up of all time. 
[01:05:00]  This was his swan song, as they call it.  His last broadcast.  Oh, yeah.  Frankie Blue was a legendary PD for this pop slash rhythm type music.  He was the go-to guy.  He was the one they all went for and hired when they wanted to do that type of music.  And the rumor has it, rumor has it, that he was at a Christmas party, got a little fucked up, might have been on something else, went back to the station, got into a huge blowout with the night girl. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  She starts crying and runs out of the building.  And the music's playing.  And Frankie Blue says, don't worry, I got it under control.  That's right.  I'll just take to the airwaves.  That's right.  And finish her shift.  You're about to hear the last time Frankie Blue was on the air.  Because he, according to certain witnesses that were there that we talked to firsthand, he was hammered. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  And this audio was never supposed to see the light of day.  No.  I mean, it was over the radio, but who's going to be recording that crap?  Earl Douglas?  Well, we had an inside job on this one.  We had an insider that got this audio for us.  I thank that person.  Yeah.  She's always been a soldier to this show.  All right, here it is.  Frankie Blue's last broadcast apiece.  I love this song. 
[01:06:30]  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been giving you a chance to win $50,000 in cash in the Mix 1027 Redo and plus win a Toyota Scion.  And I think that is going to happen tomorrow morning. 
[01:07:00]  Tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  Ricky, RuPaul, Kim will pick a winner and go to that winner's house like publishing clearance.  Publishing clearance.  Whether it's a house or it's a job.  We're coming to you, baby.  We're going to find you and we're going to reward you with $50,000 in a brand new Toyota. 
[01:07:30]  And I don't I don't see how you cannot be happy about that.  This is Frankie Blue.  So make sure you're listening tomorrow about 8 a.m.  50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner.  He screwed it all up.  Of the redo contest of the winner of the Toyota Scion. 
[01:08:00]  Come on, baby.  You know you want it.  If you have qualified in the past several weeks, we're going to pick the winner tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there, pick a winner, and we're going to find you.  And I don't care if it takes all day.  It's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right.  We have the armored truck. 
[01:08:30]  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  But more important than that, we've got the best music in town.  So why don't you give me a call?  This is Frankie Blue for Yvonne Velasquez.  And telephone number is, if you want to make a request, is 1-877-MIX-1027.  So give me a call.  Okay, baby?  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  That was supposed to be a 20-second break. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe 30 seconds.  On those stations, it's supposed to be a real quick hit, and then you're back to the music.  That was pushing three minutes.  Oh, did he babble on and on?  Did that cost him his job or no?  That break didn't cost him his job, did it?  The next one, which is only a minute.  Well, that one was probably gearing up to it.  That was survival.  And, yeah.  Let me ask you a question.  Does anybody know?  That's the exact same thing they're doing now on 92.3.  Yes.  Yes.  What are they doing on 1027 now? 
[01:09:30]  Fresh?  Yeah.  This was, uh, what was this called?  It's like a light FM kind of a thing.  1027 mix?  They did the same thing a few years ago, and it failed.  Yeah.  It's amazing what decisions they make.  Yeah.  It's the same stuff.  It's the same shit!  Yeah.  Why am I yelling?  By the way...  Mad.  Sorry.  Speaking of yelling, someone's yelling on instant feedback.  Sandy Bottom, I have no fucking idea what you're talking about, so stop writing the  same shit over and over again.  What?  What?  People are stupid. 
[01:10:00]  I don't even want to read what he's writing, because it doesn't make any sense.  Explain yourself.  Thank you.  Back to the Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue.  This is the one I think that got him fired.  Mix 1027.  The new Mix 1027.  This is Frankie Blue.  And I am so excited for tomorrow.  I got Ricky and Rue.  Tomorrow.  Coming in in the morning. 
[01:10:30]  Putting a hand in the big old barrel and picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner.  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest.  You got the call that is wrong.  And also, you win a Toyota Scion.  Now, what's going to happen is they're going to pull.  They're going to put their hand in the barrel. 
[01:11:00]  They're going to pick out a winner.  And then they're going to fight that winner.  And that winner will be rewarded with everything.  Mix 1027.  Frankie Blue.  What's happening?  He missed the post a little on that one.  The chick's singing.  He's fucking babbling.  We're going to find the winner.  We're going to fuck the winner.  We're going to fuck the winner.  He's babbling.  He says KTU.  W KTU.  He's on WNEW.  KTU was his old station. 
[01:11:30]  Was his old station.  That he made really popular.  Jesus.  He's just a mess.  Did that end his career?  Yeah, that was it.  That was pretty much, yeah.  He was fired pretty much the next day.  They didn't even have the internal investigation.  No.  Goodbye.  He said we got to get rid of this guy.  We're going to fuck the winner.  Wow.  I think he was trying to say fine, but then he burped or something.  He came out like fuck.  Yeah.  Poor guy. 
[01:12:00]  Thinking he's stepping in to save the world after a chick left.  Right.  And wow.  Just ended his fucking career right there.  Alright.  Put that away for another 90 days.  90 days.  He comes back out.  Fucking Frankie Blow.  He rules.  You want to stay into the part two of Chunky Radio?  Yeah, I think we have to.  Staying with the radio theme for a little bit?  I want to hear a little more Chunk.  We got to get sarcastic salmon here.  Let's not forget, in about a half hour, Jay Moore and John Cena arriving at the same time. 
[01:12:30]  And then Ray Liotta at 8.30 this morning.  Very excited to talk to Ray.  Oh, who's running out to get my DVD?  Yeah.  The second we can get it.  What time is the store's open?  I got to get one.  I think 9 o'clock.  What time is Ray Liotta coming?  8.30.  Talk slow.  Shh.  Okay.  What is here?  We'll do the interview slow.  No, it's not 8.30.  What time is he coming in?  It was supposed to, what time is Ray coming in? 
[01:13:00]  8.30 or 9, something around there.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to miss out on my movie memorabilia.  We'll make it happen.  All right.  That's what I want to hear.  Make it so.  Yeah.  I just got a list in front of me.  Bobo Springsteen clips in Dillette.  You want to hear just one?  One.  Just give the people a taste.  Just one.  Just one.  So we got the Vinny one, the Kenny one, the Eastside Dave, E-Rock, Travis, Steve, Sam, or Jim.  I kind of personally liked when he just riffed, but I don't remember what he was saying about 
[01:13:30]  each person.  So just spin the wheel.  Let's give a, all right, let's go with E-Rock then.  Okay.  Here's Bobo Springsteen.  E-Rock.  He's from Hope, New Jersey.  He's big.  He eats a banana puss for breakfast.  And then for lunch, he eats a garlic butters.  So, and he goes on a cruise.  He eats a lot. 
[01:14:00]  And he's got diamond status.  Whoa.  He's got diamond status.  That's all you get.  Come on, Sam.  Sarcastic Sam.  He didn't answer to sarcastic, Sam, because it's not being sarcastic.  I'm sorry.  It pins me into a corner when you call me that.  I don't want to tear down that wall.  You're right.  So where are we with Chunky Radio here, Sam?  Well, I think we're getting ready to go to his next thought starter. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Thought starter.  You write down here, Chunky breaks new ground with his next bit.  Right.  Is new ground in quotes?  I love when Sam puts things in quotes to really let you know what's happening.  And for the people that are just tuning in, this is what replaced us on regular radio pretty much.  This type of programming.  Yeah, this type of programming.  Not him exclusively, but...  Him and Tic Tac.  He made the paper the other day for being such a revolutionary by using Twitter, Facebook, things like that in conjunction with a radio show. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Which I've never heard of.  That's crazy.  Holy Jesus, that's insanity.  I appreciate the person that was defending us on the New York radio message board saying exactly that.  Oh, really?  Where the fuck has David Hinckley been?  Opie and Anthony have been doing this for a long, long time.  Where has Hinckley been?  Please.  We looked into his Twitter account, and David Hinckley made a big deal about his Twitter account, and we looked it up, and he has 24 people following him.  24 followers, yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Today he has 244, which means about 200 of our listeners have joined his Twitter account.  All hostile.  Right.  They took it over.  They certainly did.  They sure have.  Chunky breaks new ground with his next bit.  You might call us jealous today.  Yes.  This is what replaced us on regular radio.  Sour grapes right here.  That's right.  This is Chunky Radio.  Now, I'm going to play it again.  Oh.  Turn it up.  Hey.  It's much too low. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  You got to really turn this up.  You got to push that piece for us, too.  There it is.  There we go.  It's supposed to distort it a little bit.  Yeah.  Give me a little distortion.  All right.  We're going to play a little more Chunky.  I got to tell you, though, these girls, they're just smart.  They're smarter than guys are.  We'd like to take your phone calls to give us these examples of how women, how you girls  are smarter than guys.  But, Chunky, don't you only want phone calls from people hanging out on 57th Street? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  I was out on 57th Street, and I saw some girls, and they just looked smarter.  Hey, Chunky, aren't you the reason for all those potholes on 57th Street?  Why don't you just try to walk to get some water?  Because I'm fat.  I get it.  Yeah.  I was walking down 57th Street, and wow, they got some hopping clubs down there.  Yeah.  Local reference.  There's not one club.  All right.  Let's get it. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Where are we at?  Club Torno Watch?  That's funny.  There's a local reference.  Club Parker Meridian.  Chunky breaks new ground with his next bit.  Let's take a listen to Chunky Radio.  This is Chunky Radio, 92.3 Now FM.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Yeah.  What if I gave you the opportunity to slap another girl dead in the face?  Oh, my God.  I know all my BK ladies listening, all my Bronx girls. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  What if I gave you the opportunity to slap one girl in the face?  Who would it be and why?  I want you to call me up here at Chunky Radio.  All right.  Let me tell you what's happening.  Oh, fucking A.  Hot 97 did this.  It was a huge fucking bit, and the station got in a lot of fucking trouble because it  had something to do with a boxing.  Because they were really bringing chicks in to smack each other.  This is what Chunky's going to do.  He's going to take phone.  Oh, my God. 
[01:18:00]  I got to start blogging.  This guy is going to take phone calls, but there's never going to be a payoff.  No.  Because CBS Radio will not allow one girl to smack another girl in the face on Chunky's  radio show.  Dude, it was never going to get to that point.  This is stupid Chunky just throwing out random questions that girls will call in with because  they want the girls to call in.  Right.  And just, hey, why don't you tell me?  Give me a call.  You notice he went with the Bronx reference?  Because we all know that's where the wild girls are, right? 
[01:18:30]  All my girls up there.  He said BK.  What?  That's Brooklyn.  Yeah.  Did he say Brooklyn?  No, he said BK.  He said BK, the Bronx.  BX is the Bronx.  BX is the Bronx.  Yes, that's true because it ends in an X.  And it's right there at the end of 57th.  Right.  You go to the Bronx.  Staten Island's at the other end.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  All right.  Well, yeah, BK is Brooklyn.  Of course.  BX is Bronx. 
[01:19:00]  But he said BK, Bronx?  Yes.  Nice.  But that's where the tough girls go.  Wow.  So he's getting a little more local for everybody.  Yeah.  He's branching out a little bit.  He's one of us.  He knows where the tough girls hang.  I wish BTK would have found him.  There's your local reference.  Chunky takes a, and it's in quotes, live phone call.  Live phone call.  And doesn't, quote, I can't spell joke for an extremely long time. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  What about you?  Hello?  Melissa.  What?  She's my best friend's ex-girlfriend, and she's a horrible person.  Why?  What did she do?  She just, she's just manipulative.  She deserves it.  Wait, hold on.  Wait, that's a big word.  I got to Google that.  What is that?  Totally.  I'm not sure she'll get it either. 
[01:20:00]  How do you spell it?  You got it.  M-A-N-I-P-U-L-A-T-I-V-E.  Okay.  She manipulated you.  No, my friend.  Oh.  There's just a whole lot of manipulative going on.  I love it.  She deserves a good backhand across the face.  Wish you do.  Anybody hit them?  Dude.  Dude, was she wearing a teabag?  Dude.  Dude. 
[01:20:30]  This has Rock Hole written all over it.  Yeah.  It's refreshing to hear Rock Hole again.  That's for our AF listeners.  Some fat fuck just getting on there with the phony radio, the phony calls.  Hey, go ahead.  And you know what a good indicator is that these calls are fucking fake recorded, whatever they are?  Listen when we take a call.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Would you talk?  You?  Me?  Me?  Hello?  What? 
[01:21:00]  Me?  You?  Dave?  He's like, hello?  Melissa?  I want to slap her.  Right.  Like, she doesn't even start out saying hello.  No, no.  He cuts that part off.  Because the hello makes it a little too human, first of all.  Yeah, yeah.  Which is stupid, I guess.  And you've got to get the...  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Hello, you're out of the air.  Another quote live call followed by a punchline that doesn't make a lot of sense. 
[01:21:30]  As opposed to the last one?  Manipulative.  Manipulative.  That was really funny how he did manipulative eight or ten times.  It's a big word.  Here we go.  Very funny.  Yo, how we doing on the phones over there?  We got some angry girls?  A lot of angry girls in New York.  What girl do you want to slap in the face and why?  Hi, I want to slap my ex-best friend.  Yes, why do you want to slap her in the face? 
[01:22:00]  Because she's trying to get me in trouble for something that I didn't do.  What happened?  A long story.  I got all day.  She tried blaming me for stealing her car when I didn't.  It was some other girl.  Is this the girl from the other one?  Dude, I thought it was like stealing a pack of gum.  You guys are out there doing Grand Theft Auto.  This is great.  I've always wanted to meet a girl that steals cars.  Dude, I got one for you to steal.  President Obama's limo. 
[01:22:30]  Nice.  Did it end there or did the tape break or what happened there?  They committed suicide.  Did the equipment finally fail from all of Opie's abuse?  Hitting and kicking it.  Finally, mercifully, it died on that line.  Holy shit.  Next day, we got a few payments left.  He treated the equipment like Chester.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
[01:23:00]  Jared in Boston.  I hear Rocky's getting, or Chunky, whatever the fuck his name is.  Chunky's getting suspended next week because he stole tickets out of the PD's office.  Dude, I'll show that PD, dude.  Be listening at 720.  Yeah, when I give away these stolen tickets.  This guy just completely robbed Rock Hole's playbook.  Yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Kazowie.  We got one more, and then we'll give Chunky Radio a rest.  A little rest for the day?  Yeah, I mean, you can't take too much of this in.  Gotta spread out the goodness.  The goodness.  I got another hour that hasn't been cut off.  Oh, shit.  This is all within like an hour and a half of yesterday's show.  He's got a lot dough in his show.  He does.  He's good.  Chunky says the women are getting totally nuts, obviously.  He takes one more live call with a funny Jesus joke. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Dude, these women are getting crazy on the phones here.  We might not have to file a restraining order against ourselves, against women.  The phones are crazy women.  I'm afraid to move.  Crazy women.  Who do you want to slap in the face, ladies?  I want to slap my ex-friend Stephanie in the face for robbing rings out of my jewelry box  and stealing my son's crucifix and jeans. 
[01:24:30]  She stole Jesus?  Yes, she did.  How do you live with yourself and steal Jesus?  Absolutely.  She's a PLS.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey-o.  Hey-o.  Hey-o.  Hello.  But that's what I'm saying.  This is just some of the stuff you get on Chunky.  I'm beside myself here.  I cannot... 
[01:25:00]  I can't grasp this.  They know what they're doing at CBS Radio, Ant.  You just, you know...  You just don't understand.  I like how Chunky's callers are good enough that they don't breathe between words.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like that fraction of a second that normal people have to breathe between words.  For some reason, those live callers, they don't have to breathe between...  It's amazing when you can digitally just remove that.  What?  Yeah, because the now way to breathe is to not at all.  Yeah, is to not breathe.  Right.  You don't have to breathe when you're talking.  No.  Let's see how to Mark. 
[01:25:30]  Mark, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Mark.  What's going on?  What's up?  Well, I think you guys should take some Rocco audio and Chunky audio and play them both  and compare the two to see how much alike they are.  The whole, you know, dude thing.  Where's E-Rock?  Just get a copy of like...  Yeah, we have one of our stations.  Royal Flush or something.  Unusual Suspects.  You got an Unusual Suspect CD?  Yeah.  Is it called Unusual Suspects? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Unusual Suspects or even Royal Flush is one.  They got Chunky's voice in their heads out there, so we got to do this right away or  we're going to miss the opportunity.  As E-Rock gets that...  Why has he got an inappropriate bell on this show?  I'm watching the news and he's dinging a little bell.  I was too busy looking at the tiny little kid playing tiny little play.  The tiny pool player was adorable.  This little kid had to be like three years old and he's shooting pool.  Real nice upbringing.  It's going to be in a bar.  Well, good news. 
[01:26:30]  Travis has found Chunky's 923 Now website page.  Oh, wow.  And this is the stuff we love.  Dude, this is what we...  Every dumb Josh got one of these fucking bio pages.  And you know what?  We're guilty of this.  Because people go...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Well, yeah, we did.  That's what they say.  Yeah, we did.  But guess what?  The difference is we learn and we move on and we get smart and others continue to do 
[01:27:00]  this dumb stuff.  Chunky Radio Likes.  You want to read some of the likes?  Oh, come on now.  Stop trying so fucking hard.  What?  What?  What happened?  He's trying again to be local.  Where's he from again, Sam?  New York City?  No, where was he from before that?  Before that.  Where was he from a week ago is what I'm trying to say.  Where was he from last week?  Detroit, Michigan.  Detroit, Michigan.  Yes.  And hold that thought because the show is just moving a million miles an hour here. 
[01:27:30]  That's fine by me.  I just found, I just was handed the unusual suspect.  No, which one?  Which one do you got?  Watch Anthony.  Watch Anthony.  I got it.  Because just reading the track will make Anthony laugh.  Oh, no.  A letter to Miguel.  No, no.  Not a letter to Miguel.  Dude.  You want to hear Rocco's letter to Miguel? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, let's hear Rocco's.  We're playing this because this Chunky sounds a bit like a guy we used to work with, Rocco.  Yeah, his whole act is very Rocco-ish.  Watch Anthony's reaction.  Or do you want to hear Rocco's surprise date?  I want to hear something with a little more interaction.  I like the Miguel one.  There's only two tracks.  We're playing both of them.  I'm sorry.  But we have to.  He needs some interaction with people.  Which is the big get.  Letter to Miguel.  So we'll warm the audience up. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  Rocco doing Rocco's surprise date.  Rocco's surprise date.  Dude.  You're going to hear a little of the Chunkster right here.  Yeah, yeah.  Just one of the many problems people have.  You got a problem, dude?  Talk to me.  Horrible.  Okay, look.  Is that Rocco or fucking?  That's Rocco?  That's Rocco.  Now, let me tell you something.  That's why we keep saying dude.  The bed is not being added in.  Right.  This isn't some trickery on our part where we added in a bed. 
[01:29:00]  This guy took Rocco's act.  Why would you take the act of a failure?  He took Rocco's playbook.  Yeah.  He's fat.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Here we go.  Just one of the many problems people have.  You got a problem, dude?  Talk to me.  Horrible fucking story.  Talk to me.  Make it out with some chick.  Nice.  I thought it was good. 
[01:29:30]  Everything was good and dandy.  Blonde hair.  Beautiful.  Everything's flowing.  Everything was flowing very well, I might add.  What happened?  Did she have a penis?  She had a fucking huge penis, man.  Dude.  It wasn't a good thing.  Get out of here.  Let me tell you something.  It was not a good thing.  Dude, you were holding a penis in your hand.  I would have kicked somebody's ass.  Kicked some ass?  I fell over.  I almost died.  Did you puke?  Did I puke?  I was puking today for crying out loud. 
[01:30:00]  I kissed a fucking homo.  You kissed him?  Yeah.  We were making out and everything.  You were making out with a guy.  And you probably liked it, you little freak.  What do I do, man?  It's not funny, man.  Dude, you stuck your tongue down a dude's throat.  Dude, no, man.  Wait.  And you liked it.  At first, yeah.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, God.  That is...  That's chunky, though. 
[01:30:30]  What year is that?  What year is that?  That's gotta be 96.  That's like 1996.  Somewhere around there?  We're in 2009, and Chunky is doing the same fucking act as Rock Hole did.  I was a pioneer, dude!  Dude, you had a guy's cock in your mouth.  I was the first dude bastard, dude!  Dude! 
[01:31:00]  You want to hear a letter to Miguel?  Uh, why wouldn't I?  I think at this point we're just entertaining ourselves, but I don't care.  This is...  Someone out there is enjoying this.  It's such a great douche chill, uh, exposing this shit for what it is.  Yeah.  Dude!  Dude, alright, here's a letter.  This was Rocko's biggest bid ever, by the way.  Oh, fuck yeah.  It made the station CD.  Yeah.  My God.  A letter to Miguel.  What is, uh, Miguel? 
[01:31:30]  It's one of those where you send letters to kids, uh, in third world nations, I believe.  Yeah, yeah, that's what it was.  It's like one of those, uh, you know those, uh, late night commercials where you give money  and you get the picture of the kid and the letters and everything like that?  Yeah.  Did Christian's children fund or something?  Well, Rockhole apparently had...  He had apparently done this and got a letter from the kid and was reading it on the air.  Yeah.  Never happened! 
[01:32:00]  Wait, now we got Allison in Jersey.  Allison.  Allison.  Allison.  Allison.  Hi, Allison.  How are you?  Good, Allison.  Good.  Um, I have a quick question.  Because I'm still getting used to not hearing you guys on the radio every morning, and, um,  I, you know, still can't change the channel.  It's just like a car accident whenever I hear Chunky on the radio.  So I was wondering if there's any way you guys can help me.  I want to call in and just call him out on his shit. 
[01:32:30]  So do you have any, um...  Say it's impossible.  Say it's impossible.  Because what you're hearing are recorded calls.  Yep.  It would be like, they would have to record you bitching him out and then play it.  It would never happen.  They're not going to take those chances.  They're not allowed to.  The program directors tell them they're not allowed to confront people.  Right.  This is a happy, fun station.  Right, right.  They're not looking for reality and real conversation. 
[01:33:00]  They're looking for, uh, pre-recorded calls of just girls to call in and, uh, talk about,  you know, the questions that, uh, the Chunkster's throwing out there.  You gotta think they got a few calls about us.  Where's Open Anthony?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What are those calls?  Sam listens to Chunk Radio every night.  Just luck, luck of the draw when he plunks those phones down.  That's what I was going to say.  If Allison listens, she should call between the songs, but, like, right when a song's  about to end, because of his way.  Yeah.  And then hopefully, boom, Chunk will plunk down the phone lines then. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, he'll, he'll, he'll, yeah, hit you right down.  And I think the Open Anthony show has obviously been forgotten about.  It hasn't been brought up.  How about a little experiment?  Allison, you called the Chunkster today and tell us what your experience was like tomorrow.  Tell us how it went.  All right?  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, thank you.  Allison from Jersey.  Here's a letter to Miguel Rocco, who sounds a lot like Chunky or Chunk.  Yeah.  Chunk?  Chunk is, well, Chunk is totally taking Rocco's playbook.  All right.  I never thought anyone would want it.  Could you ring the, I don't even know, I haven't heard this been in a long time. 
[01:34:00]  Could you ring the bell every time you hear dudes?  The dude bell?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This one might not have many dudes.  It might not.  We'll see.  My name is Rocco.  And, uh, over the weekend I was watching television and I'm watching the commercial for sponsoring  a kid.  So I called up and I told him, I want to sponsor a child.  And, uh, I'm writing him a letter, but here's what I got so far. 
[01:34:30]  I was writing the letter.  Dear Miguel, how are the things in your village?  Is the drought over yet?  I'm just sitting here playing Nintendo.  It's about 95 degrees outside and I have the AC on cube.  So I stay nice and cool.  My mom is such an asshole.  She made me clean the pool.  We had this huge party at the house with tons of people and there was so much food.  We had to put it in our second refrigerator downstairs and it just sat there for two weeks and spoiled. 
[01:35:00]  We had to throw it all away.  When you go outside, I mean, do you still have to pee outside or do they have toilets yet?  How's the insect problem?  I heard it's pretty rough over there.  I'm going to send you a can of off.  When it rains outside, does your mom make you guys mudslides?  Right back soon.  Rocco.  How's that?  I can feel the caring.  I do care, damn it.  Not only does Rocco suck, he's a dick. 
[01:35:30]  The thing with that, though, is he's fucking just bragging to the kid.  Why would you brag to someone?  Oh, literal Jim.  God, that was awful.  There you go, Jimmy.  That's what we have to deal with.  Not only awful, that was deemed put it on a CD worthy.  That wasn't just...  That was a fucking CD?  Dude, that was on a CD that was sold in stores.  Holy dick!  They said, Rocco, we need two of your best tracks for this CD that the station's putting out. 
[01:36:00]  And that's what Rocco gave him.  The first thing you heard, and then that.  Who would laugh at that, ever?  Apparently...  No one!  The Chunkster was a fan.  Yeah, the Chunkster.  Chunkster has an influence.  That's fucking terrible.  It really is bad.  That's fucking terrible.  We had our famous Tourette's phone call on that same CD.  Just to give a comparison to the hardcore listeners out there. 
[01:36:30]  That was genius.  Yes, it was.  Yes, it was.  The Chunkster's website, you want to get back to that?  Yeah.  Again, this whole local angle shit just annoys the piss out of me.  So now that was Rocco from 96-ish.  Yeah.  Now we fast forward back to Chunky, who sounds a lot like Rocco, who is pretty much in our place.  Yeah.  This is what they replaced us with.  The Chunkster, Chunky Radio likes.  These are his likes.  Food.  All right. 
[01:37:00]  Food.  All right.  Nice girl to take home to mama.  Chinatown in Little Italy.  Aha!  Local.  Yeah, that's right down 57th, I believe, is Chinatown.  And then the other side is the Jersey Shore, but you won't catch me in a bathing suit.  Because he's fat, right?  But you don't go to the Jersey Shore.  You just move to town.  You don't even know what the Jersey Shore is all about.  You go to the eight-mile shore in fucking Detroit. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  There is no shore.  He has no idea what the Jersey Shore is.  Just kicking it with my friends.  Yeah.  What?  Your self-esteem, fatty?  Mm-hmm.  So you get it?  Mm-hmm.  Clubs.  He's used to seeing people walk up to him with them and bashing him over the head.  Trying to steal his pelt.  Pelt of an elephant seal.  He likes clubs, partying, and sleeping.  Dislikes. 
[01:38:00]  Small-ass taxis.  Oh, wow.  Another little New York reference.  By the way, there's no small-ass taxis.  No, it's pretty much the biggest backseat you'll get.  Chunk's a big guy, keep in mind.  Well, that's true.  Yeah, thank you, Sam.  People in my way at the buffet.  You didn't say it?  Oh, people that smell.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  What, like fat people?  I don't know.  They do tend to reek.  Clothes that don't fit.  Probably has a lot of those, I bet you.  Anchovies. 
[01:38:30]  My stepdad that left me on a church doorstep when I was three.  Not true.  Rock music.  He doesn't like rock music.  Until he's on a rock station.  Here's how phony this is.  Please.  When this all goes down the shitter, and perhaps this guy gets another shot, and they put him  on a rock station, his dislikes will not say rock music.  It will say, the horrible music I played at my last station, if you had any balls. 
[01:39:00]  And of course, the last of the dislikes, Z100.  That station is old.  And their music sucks.  And their DJs talk too fast about nothing.  Is it better to talk slowly about nothing?  Their music sucks.  They're playing the same music.  Well, now is a little more now.  Z100 is kind of playing yesterday's stuff.  Is it then?  Yeah.  Z100.  It's been around since 1983 or whatever.  Yeah.  Doesn't that show longevity? 
[01:39:30]  Exactly.  You want something young and youthful and hip.  And something that'll be gone in a month or two.  Hey, good news.  We were trying to move on from Chunk, but Bobo's on the line.  Bobo!  I got a little song.  I was at the beach in the Jersey Shore, and I almost died and got sick when I saw Chunky  in the bikini.  Thank you, Bobo, for that little song. 
[01:40:00]  Why would he be in a bikini?  Chunk, where's bikinis?  I don't doubt it is.  They're called T-backs!  Yeah, dude!  Hey, intern, call up to Marriott.  I'm sitting over to order a pasta.  I need a ham.  He used to fucking get free food.  And then put Anthony's TV on the ice. 
[01:40:30]  On the ice.  Because ice doesn't melt.  Fucking asshole.  We had no TVs in it.  Like, we take for granted some of the things we have now.  Well, we've always evolved, like, media and the internet and everything else.  But back then, we didn't have six or eight flat-screen TVs.  No, flat-screen TVs.  We had Anthony's tiny, what was it, eight-by-eight-inch TV?  It was a small little black-and-white portable little carry.  And I used to take that in so we could kind of monitor the news, things that were happening, whatever.  And Rockhole had, I don't know, I guess they sent him over a fucking whale-sized serving of shrimp. 
[01:41:00]  And it was in these bus trays, these busboy trays, full of ice.  Right.  And they put my TV on top of the ice cubes.  For what reason?  I don't know.  Thinking it was just going to stay there all night.  Well, it turns into water when left overnight.  So I walked in, and there was my little TV in a bus tray full of water.  I just picked it up, and out of the vent holes, just water poured out. 
[01:41:30]  That was a big deal, too, because no one was making money.  No, and we kind of needed that TV.  Did that hurt the TV?  To tell you the truth, I didn't turn it on or anything.  I left it for about a week, and it turned back on and just worked.  It did.  So, yeah.  Nice.  Yeah, but just the fact that you would be so stupid as to think ice is going to stay there,  and you could put things on it in the morning, it will just be there.  Well, we end this whole mess with Fat Chunky Sweepers. 
[01:42:00]  We didn't even ask for these, but they're coming in.  Here's two from Fat Fan in Seattle.  Good old Fat Fan in Seattle came up with this overnight.  Fat Chunky, dumb as a monkey.  If Hack was a drug, he'd be a Chunky.  If Hack was a drug, he'd be a Chunky.  Oh, that's pretty funny. 
[01:42:30]  Fat Chunky, dumb DJ funky.  Now FM should just hire a monkey.  Hey, pass those on to Z100.  We have chosen our side.  Now it's Z100.  Iraq, he knows everybody over there, I'm sure.  Of course he does.  He's trying to get a job.  Yeah, of course he is.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We got 911 audio of a wife who handcuffed herself to her husband. 
[01:43:00]  And bit husband?  Yeah, she was very angry.  And the husband, wow, he takes it like a man.  In quotes.  Put that in Sam quotes.  I mean, we've given you terrific radio already.  Let's be honest with each other.  Oh, come on.  But this is going to put it over the top.  This 911 audio is going to put it over the top.  And then we got Ray Liotta coming in at, what, 8.30.  Okay, and John Cena's here?  He's here.  Nice.  John Cena joins the program next.  And Jay Moore will be walking through that door shortly. 
[01:43:30]  So it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Oh, my God.  We're just in a silly, silly mood today.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Jay Moore.  Yes.  And superstar John Cena. 
[01:44:00]  Most importantly, John Cena's here.  John.  Guys, what's up?  What's up, John?  I'm back again.  Yeah, again.  Thank you for having me, by the way.  Not a problem.  Of course, your big day coming up.  I know.  Fighting for the championship.  Indeed.  25th anniversary of WrestleMania.  Anthony's a huge fan, man.  No, I asked Sam.  No, I...  What are you kidding?  I'm a fan.  I like the WWE. 
[01:44:30]  He's also a movie star.  We're looking at a movie star right now.  12 rounds.  Big week coming up.  All these guys.  12 rounds.  You think he's going to lose with a movie coming out, you dopes?  What are you out of your minds?  The movie comes out before the match.  Who's to say?  The star of 12 rounds.  And almost the heavyweight champion of the world.  That was Bruce Buffer, not Michael Buffer.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That guy sounds insane.  He does the UFC vibes.  The new champion of the world. 
[01:45:00]  I'm not my brother.  Yeah, he didn't want to sound like anybody else in the family.  Oh, my gosh.  He's something.  Yosemite Sam in a tuxedo.  Who, you varmint?  The rudeness.  Chattanooga.  Michigan General.  Now I've got to go to the ship and get another match. 
[01:45:30]  John, 12 rounds comes out Friday.  Yeah, indeed.  What is it about, man?  It's an action flick.  I play a beat cop who brings a super criminal justice by mistake.  He vows revenge, breaks out a year later, takes my girlfriend,  and forces me to go through 12 rounds or 12 challenges to get her back and save the day.  Nice.  Takes your chick.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Why isn't there that scene where the guy's just like, you know what?  I should get another one.  And the movie.  Yeah, and the movie right there.  The girls are, God, they're stupid in movies. 
[01:46:00]  They really are.  Constantly, like, when the hero guy comes around the corner and holds the gun and he's like,  I finally got the bad guy.  And then the bad guy kind of smiles and reaches into some dark corner and pulls the chick out  in front and you go, I told you to stay where you are for a reason.  Yeah.  You're ruining everything.  God, these bitches.  Mr. Bond, in exactly 14 hours, the pendulum will begin to swing.  11 minutes to the day, the shark will be released from the tank and begin swimming towards you. 
[01:46:30]  And the shark looks hungry, Mr. Bond.  Hungry for secret agent?  John Cena will dive into tank.  That's all I got.  You look like you're going to court.  You all right?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I got...  Parking tickets or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got some stuff where I got to be gussied up today.  What's up with you guys wearing the suits these days?  They are dressed very professional.  CW 11.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  CW 11.  Exactly.  The traffic report.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That gets up.  Come on out, homie.  Not homie.  Come on, homie.  But, yeah, just making the rounds.  We got a lot of promote, so I got to wear many masks.  I don't even think he knows he hit on something there.  Oh, I know.  Well, I do.  There's a whole traffic thing on that channel in regards to this man right here.  Oh, that's right.  That's right. 
[01:47:30]  You guys told me that before.  Mick Foley set that one up.  Yeah.  Remind me to thank him.  I was on CW 11 like two weeks ago.  Yeah.  It was at St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah.  And they cut to her live in the street, but no one was in the street yet.  And she just looked like the last person on earth running up without the street.  She looked like I am legend.  Yeah.  With a stupid hat on.  Just a drunken legend.  In just seven hours, the place is going to be packed.  It's going to be off the hook.  Stop talking like that.  You're not a Ricky Lake, do we? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  What's it like to not get cut out of a movie, John?  Oh, shit.  Wow.  You're the big star of the movie.  It's fulfilling.  Should I turn the question around and ask what it's like to be cut out of a movie to you?  That's wonderful.  It'll make you do a sitcom.  Right on.  Okay.  What'd you get cut out of?  Street Kings?  I was up to 215 pounds.  I was like Mysterio, brother, for crying out loud.  And there's like entire scenes of me and Keanu talking, and it's just from over my shoulder 
[01:48:30]  to his gorgeous face.  Gone.  All gone.  It's, yeah.  Big scenes.  Who knows?  Because it's, you know, do you want to show this guy with his porn star mustache that  looks like Kerry Collins, or do you want Keanu Reeves?  Maybe I'm not as good as I think I am.  Maybe that's why.  You know what I got just last night to pop into my kaleidoscape player down there in  the theater?  I got Go, and I got Suicide Kings. 
[01:49:00]  Didn't get cut out of those two.  No, you did not get cut out of those.  That's back when I had heat.  That was...  Suicide Kings is a good effing movie, man.  Those are two great fucking movies.  Go is hysterical.  Fucking love that movie.  And then Suicide Kings, you know, is fucking great.  What about The Marine?  The Marine?  Yes.  I don't want to put that on Front Street, but that's probably the best film in the history  of cinematography.  Of any film.  Do you have any John Cena movies in your system?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, The Marine. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's the one and only.  That's the only one so far.  Soon we have two, 12 rounds.  It's going under the Cena collection.  I'll get you the bootleg.  That is starting.  Oh, I got it already.  All right, right off.  I paid for it.  Hey, John's in the paper today, too.  What are you doing?  Yeah, I made the news, I guess.  A little mad at A-Rod and the steroid thing.  Yeah, well, once again.  People see you and they go, he had to be on steroids.  My goodness.  And I know you haven't.  I mean, you've said it a million times.  Come on.  You did something.  Come on.  A little bit.  A little bit. 
[01:50:00]  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  And of course.  A little bit.  A little bit.  One day a real rain is going to come, John.  Don't get nervous.  Don't get nervous.  In my party.  Once again, the media kind of take me out of context.  It's not necessarily I was mad at A-Rod.  I just think, you know, all these guys are getting caught or busted for substance abuse  or performance-enhancing drugs.  This has not just started with A-Rod or Barry Bonds or whomever.  This has been going on for quite some time.  And the drugs are illegal.  And I think the athletes take these chances because there really is virtually no penalty. 
[01:50:30]  A-Rod's still playing, still getting paid.  You know, Bonds had a great career off it.  All these guys are still doing what they're doing.  And if you took the penalty and let pretty much the government get involved and send  these guys to jail, then they're sacrificing contract money.  They're sacrificing sponsorship money.  And they have a criminal record.  And going to jail.  And going to jail.  You know, the drugs are illegal.  We're going to lock up our baseball players.  Well, if they're essentially quote-unquote cheating and breaking the law, you know, it  obviously would make that choice a little bit more difficult. 
[01:51:00]  But it's America.  Is it against the law?  It's like apple pie.  To actually do steroids.  Yeah, they're actually banned.  It's against the law.  But we're the only country that bans them.  Like, you can go to Europe.  You go to Slavia.  You can go to Europe.  The Eastern Bloc.  Everyone's like Madonna and everybody gets their HGH.  Yeah, yeah.  And like Richard Branson.  They go to the clubs.  Richard Branson.  The trench coat's selling it.  Yeah.  The HGH is like a big thing in Europe.  That's why nobody's dying over there anymore.  We do.  I mean, we have a little bit of a skewed system over here.  But that's the law.  And I think if people are going to make such a big deal out of it, especially bringing these 
[01:51:30]  guys in front of Congress and having these hearings and spending taxpayer money on this  stuff.  They're not doing anything about it.  They're letting the governing body.  Even in the case of the WWE, we sanction ourselves.  It's a suspension, suspension, and termination.  So it's one of those things.  You're fired.  It's one of those things where if the government was so up in arms about it, they should get  involved from a legal standpoint.  And that's my two cents, David.  I like that strongman competition when those jacked up guys.  Ken Patera.  Hurst the first of Kherkin-Furkin.  Loves me some strongman. 
[01:52:00]  The Ferkin Hurkin.  Yeah.  You like the strongman?  Take your ship anchors and throw them through the third story window.  And no one knows why.  That's the best thing.  Why are we doing that?  It's the best.  Why don't we just bench like the combine?  How many times can you heft 225 pounds?  They're not going to be pulling.  I can do it once.  Pulling 767s with their teeth.  That's my max, gentlemen.  Stay right free, just like you guys.  Hold back a B-52 with your fingertip. 
[01:52:30]  The 767, 100-yard dash.  Like, why?  Like, why do we do that?  Yeah, those guys are all, like, jacked on some juice.  I stop and watch every fucking time, though.  Oh, yeah.  It's a great announcer.  It's like, oh, this guy's got everything it takes.  Yeah.  He's fucking putting needles in his ass on the way down to the finish line.  You can see zits popping on his back as he's trying to push some fucking bouldered.  The faster his heart beats, the zits pop themselves. 
[01:53:00]  Thum, thum.  Thum, thum.  Thum, thum.  Oh, my goodness.  He's probably like a wet gremlin.  You definitely want to be first one in that heat.  Oh, shit.  You ever see the one where they take the tractor tires?  Yeah.  Like, they're literally as high as the ceiling, and they've got to, like, knock them end over end.  Not roll them.  Making those phases.  Not roll them.  Yeah, there's one guy who just turns it sideways and roll the thing down the fucking hill.  Yeah, watch.  Done.  Five seconds, done.  You're on for me.  Face. 
[01:53:30]  But, yo, you like the Red Bull, though?  Yeah.  They just laid down a Red Bull and a muscle milk right in front of me, and that's a pretty  decent breakfast right there.  What is a muscle milk all about?  It's just like a beer.  It's donkey cum.  He doesn't care.  No, he's a man.  Standard meal replacement from the semen of jungle animals.  Find it at any drugstore.  You know how it is.  It typically is vanilla flavor.  Yeah.  It's frothy when you get into it.  Yeah.  Look at the size of Cena's hands.  My God.  I know. 
[01:54:00]  You're a large guy.  Just crush him.  I shook your hand outside, and I was like, hi, Mr. Cena.  She turned into an instant bitch when you shake John Cena's hand.  Hi, Mr. Cena.  Yeah.  So, guys, what else is up?  What's going on?  I don't know.  We just sit here on a daily basis and babble about things.  I want to hear more about the movie, though.  Who else is in it with you?  Who plays the villain?  The villain is Aiden Gillen, and he's known from, he was a corrupt mayor on The Wire,  the TV show.  Oh, he was great. 
[01:54:30]  He was getting a blowjob in one episode.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's how Jimmy measures your IMDb page.  I mean, his greatness is obviously, yeah.  Jimmy plays IMDb.  Who got blown?  Looked like he threw muscle milk in someone's face.  That's the guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The fucking cop walks in and sees him getting blown with his big old mayor dick hanging  out.  It was fucking great.  Good thing it wasn't Patterson.  She would have been sucking his finger.  But then again, he's a governor.  Yeah, well, well, whatever.  We're huge fans of The Wire, so.  Right on?  So right there, we got to see 12 Rounds when it comes out Friday. 
[01:55:00]  Right there, you're in it.  Brian White is my best friend.  He was in Stomp the Yard, Mr. 3000.  He's been in a bunch of stuff.  It was directed by Renny Harlan, who did Die Hard 2.  Oh, shit, yeah.  Cliffhanger.  He's done a bunch of stuff.  So we had a good cast, a good director, and we got a good movie, man.  Who's the girl?  Ashley Scott.  I don't know who she is.  She was, believe it or not, check this, Six Degrees of Separation, The Rocks Love Interest  in Walking Tall.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  Yes, indeed.  Look at that, yeah.  A little crosshose.  She's like, oh, fuck, I got to work with wrestlers again. 
[01:55:30]  Another wrestler again.  Jesus Christ.  Next she's in Little Women 2 with The Undertaker.  Yeah.  The remake of Citizen Kane with Dusty Rhodes.  With his lisp.  Rosebud.  He sounded like Pesci and JFK.  Cancer to the neck.  I've had it for years.  Bothered me for years.  Cancer to the neck.  Worst wig ever.  What a fucking weakness.  You're not a bad looking man, Mr. Gass. 
[01:56:00]  Kevin Bagan was so good in that.  Yeah, he sure was until Madoff stole everything he had.  He's broke.  Poor guy.  He has to start over.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, Cena.  We're all broke.  Are you getting married?  Indeed I am.  There's rumors all over the internet.  Those are not rumors.  Those are truth.  Have you said it's true yet?  Are we making news today?  No, no.  I think a couple days ago I came out with the official name.  How about you do it on our show?  Too late now.  We could use a little bump.  We're always late on the news.  We're late on everything.  We had what's-her-name in here, and the next day she admits that she had sex with A-Rod. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  We're always a little late on the news.  His wife.  That's how late we are on the news.  Cynthia Rodriguez.  Kirsten Davis, right?  Kirsten Davis.  Kirsten Davis.  The madam, yes.  Kirsten Davis, the madam.  She's on our show, and we're having a great interview, and the next day she tells everyone  she had sex with A-Rod.  Yeah.  How about you throw us a bone?  Yeah.  I wish I had something to tell you, Hope.  Well, it happens.  I got something for you.  Yeah?  What do you got?  April 8th.  I'm going to be in Red Bank, New Jersey.  Count Basie?  Count Basie Theater.  There you go.  April 9th, Morristown, New Jersey. 
[01:57:00]  That's where the Jews live.  All right.  Right.  Let's work John a little bit.  Give us something that the internet will pick up on.  Come on.  A little something.  Who's your wife?  Where'd you meet her?  She's a high school sweetheart.  Wow.  What did you go to high school?  I actually went to.  No, she's still going to high school.  She's still going to high school.  She's a sweetheart.  We've got to wait until the end of the year to actually do the D.  No, I've known her for a long time.  We've known each other for about 12 years now.  Wow.  Where are you from, John?  I'm from West Newbury, Massachusetts. 
[01:57:30]  It's like North Shore just before you get to New Hampshire.  Yeah.  Mass.  Right up there in the corner, basically.  Yeah, pretty much.  No accent.  Kind of lost that accent, though.  That's a good thing.  You get like an 18-pack of Pabst in me.  It'll come back.  Oh, every so often?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're one of those goddamn Sox fans?  I think by birthright.  Yeah.  You're born there.  You just never change, man.  You just never change.  You know what I love about Boston fans?  As soon as a player leaves your orbit, it's revisionist history.  Like, that player was never worth their weight in the dog shit.  They sucked the whole time. 
[01:58:00]  You remember Chappie, my friend Chappie?  Whatever.  He used to be a doorman at Knicks, and now he's a friend of...  He used to be like,  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Antoine Walker and fucking Paul Pierce are the best fucking forwards in NBA history.  These two fucking animals.  They are fucking marvelous to watch.  And then Antoine Walker goes to Miami Heat, and he goes,  Antoine Walker was a fucking slave, JJ.  He was a fucking fat bum.  Always did his hoist three-pointers.  Fucking good riddance.  I named my daughter Johnny and my son Damon. 
[01:58:30]  I have a bracelet.  What would Johnny Damon do?  He's on the Yankees.  He had no fucking arm, Johnny Damon.  Exactly.  That fucking guy was a goddamn weakling in center field,  fucking running around with his fucking dreadlocks.  Hang on, dreadlocks?  Shut up.  He was a fucking queer.  That is too goddamn true.  Good.  I'm glad Curt Schilling retired.  He was a fucking kid touch-out.  Fuck Curt Schilling and Johnny Damon in their ass. 
[01:59:00]  Johnny Pesky would have fucking taken Curt Schilling deep.  The bloody sock was a farce.  It was a fucking bloody champon fell out of his ass  from getting fucking ass-wrapped from that slave, Antoine Walker.  Jesus could leave the Red Sox.  They'd go, all he ever did was sacrifice.  Dirty Jew.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's brilliant.  That's fucking brilliant.  Sacrifice.  All the time with the sacrifice.  Jesus.  I'll bat whenever you need me to bat, shanty Irish. 
[01:59:30]  So, John.  John, what did you move it about?  Back to John.  I want to talk a little bit about your match for the championship here.  Now, the big show, apparently, is trying to have some kind of relationship?  Yes.  With?  The general manager of SmackDown and the interim general manager of Raw, Vicky Guerrero.  Right.  Yeah.  Now, why is the third guy thrown in there?  Because currently, Edge, the radar superstar, is not only the champion, but as far as our 
[02:00:00]  show goes, he can play the guitar as well.  He is married to Vicky Guerrero.  So, there's a little problem there.  It's a bit of a love triangle.  So, where do you come in?  I'm actually just the guy who wants to be the champion.  Oh, so you kind of want to be.  You would have fought him anyway.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But then the big show's got to be thrown in there.  Yeah.  Who sanctions a three-person championship match?  Vicky Guerrero.  Really?  Yes.  She's allowed to do that? 
[02:00:30]  She's the general manager.  Went right over everyone.  She can just make decisions.  She's the head muckety-muck now?  Yeah, well, there's been some McMahon tragedies on the show.  Well, yeah, I've seen the McMahon tragedies.  We want to get into that for a minute or two.  Yeah, we want to talk a little bit about that.  That's fine.  Get this message back to Vince for us.  Every six months or so, Vince comes out, starts yelling at somebody.  Yeah.  And then just gets laid out.  And then see you bye.  And he's gone for six more months.  He comes back for a day.  What is Vince doing?  He's, I guess, he's building up his comeback for about six months and then making one great 
[02:01:00]  day of it.  Is that what it is?  Now, what kind of plastic surgery is he getting?  We're thinking maybe a little cosmetic surgery.  He needs some time off.  No, no, no.  He's at TV every week.  Every week?  Yeah, I mean, these guys are running the show.  From what?  The family runs the show.  He's in the hospital bed because I know he was very injured that last time.  Of course, of course.  But I mean, this is from the WWE, the entertainment part of it.  It's episodic television, guys.  What?  If I'm the first one that has to sit here, we could be breaking news here on Opie and 
[02:01:30]  Anthony.  I may have to tell you that wrestling is indeed entertainment.  And we also may have to have a conversation about Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.  It's not me that's going to have a problem.  It's young Sam.  If he hears that.  But Santa never did steroids.  He'll be crushed.  Santa, well, you never know.  Santa was pretty buff for a while.  He made those rounds every Christmas Eve, man.  That's a lot of ground to come.  He was on the Black Beauties to get around all night.  Did he look like Mr. Magoo when he went in front of Congress, like Mark McGuire did?  Oh, my goodness.  Jesus Christ.  The guy's all jacked up.  The guy's jacked up, smashing balls into parking lots from Major League Stadiums. 
[02:02:00]  And then he's in front of Congress, oh, Magoo, you've done it again.  He's got his little spectacles on.  His tiny little accounting glasses.  His arms are like twigs.  Jim Rome said he looked like Ronald McDonald.  Called him Mark McDonald.  That is fresh.  Mark McDonald.  What's that about?  And now he's a golfer.  That's good.  Playing golf balls.  He's playing golf.  What happened?  He's a good golfer.  Wonder what his drive is.  Now? 
[02:02:30]  Wonder if he can still hit it big.  Yeah.  That's a good question.  A little bigger going on.  Probably not.  So do you win WrestleMania?  Let's get it on the table.  I'd like to say that I'm going to win.  You do.  If you're asking me, I'm going to win.  He's nodding to me.  So let's have the wrestling size pick that up.  Let me tell you something.  Can I bet on this?  Is there a bookie maybe that's going to take the action?  I saw Andre the Giant, who's the last man standing.  Savant sword below him all had him clearly out of the ring.  Fucking sucks.  Indeed.  That's Boston Talk Radio right there. 
[02:03:00]  That's hilarious.  That's exactly how it is.  Every time anyone leaves, they were...  Billy Guerin was a bum, JJ.  What did he ever do?  Noma, Manny, Pedro.  Oh, Manny, yeah.  Noma has hips of a woman.  He had an operation.  An operation?  Noma had an operation where they put in woman hips.  Oh, Christ.  When does Father's 2 open?  I need a cocktail.  You know?  Error!  Error!  Error! 
[02:03:30]  So, here's the deal, guys.  I got no news besides the movie, and besides WrestleMania.  The movie's big news, though.  The movie is big news, but like personal nuggets?  I like being the star of a movie.  Are you trying to leave?  No, no.  I'm just...  Maybe...  Oh, alright.  What's the matter?  What are you, holding him captive?  Yes.  I know.  You guys keep feeding me Red Bull and muscle milk.  I'll stay all day.  We had Kurt Angle in here yesterday.  Yeah, you were talking about that out of studio.  That guy was a dick.  Our old friend Kurt Angle.  Jesus, Jay.  You didn't like him?  No, not at all.  Why?  I thought he was nice. 
[02:04:00]  What happened, Jay?  The whole fucking thing that happened?  What thing?  Okay, what happened?  What happened?  He pinned me down.  He farted in my face.  No, I wasn't here.  The whole thing left.  What the heck?  Don't you guys work here?  Did you notice that I was not here?  Well, I thought maybe you heard something after...  Yeah, you know.  Kurt Angle had no arm.  Well, he did leave the WWE, so, you know, now...  He did.  Yeah.  Great.  Now he's wrestling in backyards in Sorgas.  He's at the Kowloon.  Saba Ville.  He's at the Kowloon with Voss and Bobby. 
[02:04:30]  Bobby.  Those two could carry that room.  Damn.  Yeah, we wish Kurt nothing but the best.  Yeah, yeah.  You watching any sitcoms these days, Kurt?  Yeah, the great Jay Moore.  What's that?  John Cena.  Call him Kurt.  Oh, because we were just talking about Kurt.  Of course.  I could have fallen asleep last night.  Every TV show on TLC, no one can have fucking two kids anymore.  Everyone's got quintuplets, five sets of twins.  There's Mormons with 95... 
[02:05:00]  I had 19 kids.  They all came out of my tunnel of a pussy.  Like, the TLC channel after 11 o'clock is just, who can have the most freaky fucking  kids running around?  And you go, this is true.  I just couldn't sleep.  My wife's got the flu.  She's awake flopping around.  And then I look at the TV and I'm like, I've got to go to bed.  And they go, coming up next, primordial dwarfs.  So I kind of just came straight from those freaks to here.  Yeah, you got to.  You certainly got to keep the channel on.  Hence my nice bed haircut.  I see that.  I didn't want to mention it.  They put the best shit on. 
[02:05:30]  And we got these outrageous hours.  There was that I Survived show that came on.  And there was a woman.  She's out in the middle of the ocean on a fish processing vessel.  And there's this big hopper with an auger at the bottom of it that apparently had to  be cleaned.  So the power gets shut off.  She crawls down in there and she's cleaning it and they're in a storm.  So there's like, the thing is really rocking.  Sure.  A guy falls into the control panel, hits the on button. 
[02:06:00]  Both her legs go through the auger up to her knees.  And they got to cut her out of this thing with torches.  She's bleeding to death.  Do you see the chick that get eaten by the shark swimming between the two party boats?  Oh, yeah.  That's a classic video.  That's a good one.  Did you see her legs go night, night?  Oh, night, night, night.  She survived that.  Did you see it?  Yikes.  Her legs go night, night.  She's just like, everyone, it's like two cruise ships and they meet up in the middle of the  Aegean Sea and they're like, everyone in the water, we got 11 minutes. 
[02:06:30]  You know, tightly wound cruise ship.  We got 11 minutes and then it's back to the party pit.  Enjoy yourselves.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Everybody out of the block.  Chocolate buffet up on the promenade.  And this chick's swimming and they're like, Marsha, look out.  And you just see like this giant shark coming up behind.  It's like a shadow.  It's huge.  Is that the girl that gets the leg ripped off?  Both of them.  Yeah.  She survived.  They pull her out of the water and you see where the leg was.  Yeah, it's awful.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  It's got to be on YouTube somewhere.  Yeah.  If you go to YouTube and type in J-Moore April 8th in Red Bank, New Jersey, you might sell 
[02:07:00]  a few tickets.  But you got to see 12 Rounds.  Yes.  12 Rounds Friday with John Cena.  I'm glad you explained what 12 Rounds meant to me.  This is exactly the kind of movie I like to go see.  Yeah.  It's a good ride, man.  It's a good action flick.  That's why I go to the movies.  If I want to see something like Revolutionary Road, I'll stay in my house and I'll watch  it on like DVD.  That was a great movie.  That DiCaprio was so good.  It stunk.  I hated it more than anything.  Jimmy does that constantly.  It was horrendous. 
[02:07:30]  Fantastic.  He was wonderful.  I hated him.  It was horrendously depressing.  Mark Cohen used to do the best, like upstairs at the Olive Tree, be like, you know, the  guy that has a big opinion and you disagree with him, he changes his mind until that second.  So you just disagree like, oh my gosh, we ate it or so.  The food was so good there.  We loved it.  Did you ever do that?  I thought it stunk.  I didn't like the sauce, though.  But he doesn't really like it.  He can't hurt.  With his stupid face.  He's funny.  He is funny and hairy.  Yeah.  He really is. 
[02:08:00]  Fucking one Epstein headed nothing.  You know, once Mark Cohen stayed at my apartment and before he left, he had to buy new sheets  because so much of his back hair was in my sheets.  He's a very hairy Jewish man who killed my Lord and Savior.  Yes, he did.  Allegedly.  Are you converting, Jay?  Yeah.  I'm writing a book about it, too.  Are you?  Yeah.  About conversion?  A priest in a comic walking into a bar.  Really?  My priest is 30 years old and he surfs every day.  That's cool.  And he locs every day. 
[02:08:30]  And he dogs every...  No, he doesn't do that.  No.  He's becoming a Catholic there, John.  What do you want to become a Catholic for?  I love it.  Anything in particular?  I love the structure.  Really?  I love everything about it.  Yeah?  I love the church I went into for the first time.  St. Monica's in Santa Monica.  They are nice churches.  You gotta give them that.  I just felt like I was at home.  It was great.  Really?  And...  You don't come across as a religious man, are you, Mr. Grady?  I just liked it.  I liked the structure.  I like...  I like...  You know...  It was one dangling participle.  I like affairs. 
[02:09:00]  I like going to a fair, but I don't want to be a carny.  You know what I mean?  No, I...  Like, you could go to church...  St. Monica's is really progressive, too.  And I didn't realize how inclusive the Catholic Church was, compared to my perception of it  growing up.  Really?  Maybe they've just...  Not if you're gay.  Well, not...  You go to St. Monica's.  There's a gay and lesbian, Stations of the Cross mass.  Now, how the hell does that work?  Because they're a progressive Catholic church.  But you can't be...  See, the rules are the rules, I think.  The rules are the rules.  I think once the rules were laid out, that's how it's supposed to be.  The rules are...  There ain't no rules. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, wow.  And tonight we're racing for pinks.  The rules are...  The pinks.  They believe that you're made exactly the way you are, and there's absolutely nothing wrong  with you, and just make you better.  I'm just as God made me.  Exactly.  What's that from?  Wanka.  Spinal Tap.  Oh, okay.  The desk clerk.  That's good.  Yeah.  He's bound him down?  It's gone now?  He's bound him down.  Ruled.  Honey, I love you.  It's done?  She dressed like a fucking dick.  Well, I think I only got six episodes.  Oh, that's it.  Then they'll see.  Or eight episodes.  How about the hilarious body double for that girl's tits in the first season?  Thank you! 
[02:10:00]  She's like kind of a pudgy patty.  Thank you!  And she's got like brown arms and like a smoker's face, and she's just kind of like, nah, look!  She takes her tits out.  It's like something out of fucking porkies.  It's the most amazing set of tits ever.  We talked about this yesterday, Jay.  Put the picture up.  Because she has a little, her arms a little chunky.  Yeah, my wife ran for that.  Yeah?  She didn't get it, right?  And then they went large, apparently.  We actually-  Oh, man.  We actually mentioned this yesterday, and someone said, Jay, and I hate to bring up a bad memory, 
[02:10:30]  they said that an ex of yours might have been in True Lies as a body double.  I don't want to talk.  Okay.  I don't know.  Who are you talking about?  I made her a millionaire.  What else do you want?  I don't know this ex.  I don't know what she does.  You ever write a check with two commas, Ope?  No.  Then go fuck yourself.  And I'll think of things to talk to you about.  It's not fun.  I didn't write one check.  I spread it out.  You spread it out like a dope.  I could keep the misery going for a while.  You better off living in a box.  But it was Dominic Barber's idea. 
[02:11:00]  You two should share in your success.  Shut up.  There you go, Jay.  Look at those.  Yeah, those are not hers.  That's definitely not hers.  Is that you?  Who's got the clicker there?  That's Danny.  Danny is quick.  He's good.  Danny's circling the areola.  Yeah, he's-  It's very nice, but look at the belly.  It's not hers.  It's because she's a bit-  She's not heavy, but I mean, she's not a fat girl.  She ain't that.  She's going to be-  After that show ends, she's going to be huge.  She's keeping that weight down for that show. 
[02:11:30]  Who else was I just watching on TV that I was like,  Oh, this person-  Oh, one of the Kardashian girls is going to be a fucking house,  and I can't wait.  The one that looks like Chyna.  Yeah.  She kind of looks like Chyna.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah?  I'm more of a fan of Kourtney.  Kim, I think, is actually really pretty.  I think it's a shame she dresses up like that  and has sex with older Cullets.  Oh, shit.  That's my Boston guy.  Back to Boston.  Wow.  We have to get John Cena out.  I'm getting a note. 
[02:12:00]  So, John-  We need to talk more about 12 rounds.  It opens Friday?  Yep, this Friday.  This Friday.  When was the premiere?  Believe it or not, there is no premiere.  We're just releasing it.  What the fuck is-  Wow.  We're just releasing it.  We're just bringing it out.  That's like old school.  That's like a KRS-1 album.  You don't give a shit.  Just bring it out.  Underground, son.  Just bring it out.  Man, underground, the RZA.  Underground, kid.  Wu-Tang, forever, 12 rounds.  Yeah, that's my RZA impression.  Wait, we got to get Dean Edwards on today  for the Tracy Morgan Showdown.  Yes, we should.  But does he have his number? 
[02:12:30]  I might have Dean's contact info.  I'm not sure.  Let's get him on for the big showdown.  He's under, who can I get to open for me in a pinch?  Oh, shit.  On your cell phone.  That's right.  I got Bert Kreischer and Segura on mine.  Bert Kreischer.  Jesus.  All right, 12 rounds in theaters Friday,  and then, of course, Wrestlemania 25.  Yes.  25.  The big 2-5.  Seems like it was just 24.  I saw the first one in a movie theater in Oklahoma.  Just about a year ago, it was 24.  Yeah, you used to go into a place and watch a closed circuit.  But it's funny. 
[02:13:00]  I just remembered that the other day, and then here you are.  Did you wrestle in college?  No, I played football.  What college?  Springfield College.  Springfield Mass.  Springfield Mass.  He was a wicked corner.  Cover corner.  John Cena, not afraid to stuff to run.  John Cena, I'll put up against any goddamn running back you throw at me.  I don't care.  Bring your Roxbury fullback across the end, and I swear to God, I'll put the goddamn two  back through the one hole. 
[02:13:30]  I know John Cena loves Tracy Morgan.  Because I love wrestling.  I am a wrestler.  John Cena's my uncle.  Nice.  You know, John, let me give you a lesson in comedy.  If you can make eight people in bleachers that want to see Morning Radio Live laugh, kill  yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  Jesus Christ.  What is this, Alice in San Francisco?  I always feel like I'm bombing on that show, and I like it a lot.  Because they suck.  They're fucking assholes.  You don't like them?  No, I think she's a fucking cunt. 
[02:14:00]  Don't be fresh.  They always act like there's something like, why are you still mad at us?  It's like, every time I walk in, I get a fucking ten minutes.  I'm like, just sell some tickets.  Jesus Christ, I'm tired.  I'm talking and kissing over here right away.  He's getting fucking fresh.  Right away.  Right away, Billy, you got a little out of line yourself.  So we have, John has to go.  Do we have, Ray Liot is on his way.  Is he here or no?  That was all the money we had, Cameron.  Is he going to be annoyed by the Ray Liot?  Oh, my God.  I hope not.  Oh, you know him?  I'm a very fancy man.  Oh. 
[02:14:30]  That's very nice.  Well.  We live near each other in the Pacific region.  I met Ray one time.  I was about to say, a very specific neighborhood where people could walk up and down like creeps.  Street.  I met Ray one time, and I bet you he doesn't remember me.  Of course not.  He'll remember you.  You're very memorable.  We'll ask him.  That's going to be the first question out of the box.  Did you touch his arm and go, Ray, can I have a picture?  No.  I just kept going, you're stuttering prick yet, until he walked out, because he loves that.  Oh, I'm sure he does.  Oh, he must love the Goodfellas references.  The bones, he shot him in the foot.  What do you want? 
[02:15:00]  I'm a good shot.  You know, Cena was the one that was bumped for Obama.  Indeed.  Got booted for the president.  Oh, that's right.  That was your spot.  Got booted for the president.  That was your spot.  Barack Obama.  Oh, Jesus.  He always hit for power, never hit for average.  You got bumped?  I don't even think people got bumped anymore from the Tonight Show.  For Obama?  Yeah.  Bumped for the press, yeah.  That was a good week, too.  Yeah.  Oh, well, who else was on that week?  Let's see.  Jimmy Norton.  No, no, I didn't watch.  Did you get bumped?  I did. 
[02:15:30]  No, why wouldn't I?  You were on.  Obama wanted Monday, but I couldn't reschedule, so they gave him Thursday.  Yeah, Jimmy was on Monday, Obama was on Thursday.  Yeah.  I have to be here.  Tell the president I'm...  All right, luckily.  Let's get John out of here.  I know.  Where are you going next?  I don't know.  People listening, maybe they can follow you around.  Certainly not anything as valuable as this.  And I do thank you guys for the time.  Special moment.  Thanks for asking me back.  I mean, this is...  No problem.  You don't have the same publicist as Taylor Hicks, do you?  No.  Is there a Taylor Hicks incident I should know about? 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, I had a big run-in with her.  That was one of the...  Can we play that?  Sure.  Find Jay Moore going after.  You'll like it.  Well, he's really got to go, because now they're...  Now they're scraping the page.  I got to pee anyway.  He's probably going to be there next.  Oh, Chit Chat.  Chit Chat is on.  No, Chit Chat.  It's a big one.  It's going to be tough.  I'm going to try to get John out of here.  WrestleMania 25, Sunday, April 4th on pay-per-view.  Sunday, April 5th.  April 5th.  There you go.  Saturday's Hall of Fame.  Are you going to be on the East Coast on April 8th?  April 8th. 
[02:16:30]  You're going to Redback, New Jersey.  Yeah, you're in Redback.  Right.  You're the best.  Wayne from Bet's going to be there.  Damn right I'm going to be in Jersey.  You're the best.  Right on.  Where are you the ninth?  The ninth I'm in Morristown.  That's right.  And all we're going to do is talk about...  Nomad Pedro.  How Jimmy Williams left Pedro in that goddamn game, one out too long.  You fucking won the next year, you apes.  Relax.  They get so bent out of shape.  They're awful people.  You fucking won.  They're awful people.  John, just get up and leave.  Yeah, John's people are just going to...  12 rounds this Friday. 
[02:17:00]  Go see it.  Guys, thanks so much.  Thank you, John.  I got a pee.  Man, dude, there's no easy way to do this with J.C.  No, I know.  Just get up and leave.  Oh, sorry.  No, it's good.  We like it.  Thanks, John.  John Cena, everyone.  Thanks, pal.  They're all leaving.  All right, we'll take a break.  We found the Taylor Hicks publicist thing.  Jay, you want to hear this again?  This is a big moment for you on the show.  Big moment.  I caught you guys bookings.  Oh, boy, did you.  Oh, that's right.  I forgot about that.  What happened?  We got Taylor Hicks.  We finally broke into the American Idol thing. 
[02:17:30]  April 8th, Taylor Hicks with me at Red Bank Theater.  Yeah, you got to make up on that stage, right?  In Morristown, New Jersey.  I got to flog this thing, Opie.  We're going to sell you some tickets.  Because if I can't fill theaters, I got to go back to the clubs.  No, you're going to be bad.  If I go back to the clubs, I'm going to start drinking.  And then I'll lose custody of my son.  You're going to be fine.  What's up, John?  You got it all planned out, don't you?  Your future.  Mr. Leota is here.  And he's a big Jay Moore fan.  Get the fuck out of here.  Well, of course.  We live now.  We see each other out of our town.  Should we reset, though? 
[02:18:00]  We should reset, right?  Yeah, let's reset quickly.  All right, we'll do the Taylor Hicks a little later after Ray leaves.  Taylor Hicks.  You could never sing anything but that acapella crap from Ruxbury.  I did a little Keitel in the middle of Ruxbury.  Holy shit.  Jay Moore just killing when the mics aren't on as well.  Look at Ray Liotta just walking into the studio.  How cool is this?  That's Sam All-Ruxbury.  That's Ray. 
[02:18:30]  I got him.  They know each other.  Jay Moore.  Ray Liotta.  Ray Liotta.  Just being pals.  Yeah.  What's your name?  Jim.  Jim.  Yeah, I like your show.  You're not awesome.  Oh, son of a bitch.  You know?  Wait, you know Jim?  I knew he'd know Jimmy.  That annoys me whenever celebrities know Jim.  Yeah, we're not happy about that.  I don't know because I get jealous and stuff.  You get jealous?  Hi, Ray Anthony.  How you doing?  Hey, Ray.  Yeah, I got like jealous of that.  Ray, you look good.  You showered for this.  I got in on the red eye.  I had to.  I just rolled in out of the wreck, as you can see. 
[02:19:00]  Look at his bed hair.  I drove from the Palisades.  Mess.  Wow.  I am a wreck.  Rolled out of bed again.  You're going to gang up on me, are you?  No.  Not at all.  You kidding me?  I can't believe people come in to...  Yeah, it's a weird concept.  It's radio, but on like Fridays and stuff, and special days like today.  Yeah, they come in to check out the show.  Yeah, they come in.  Makes us feel good, right?  Are they in your eyeline, Ray?  It's like Wonderama.  No, I'm just blown out by it. 
[02:19:30]  You're just trying to figure out what's going on here, right?  It's a weird crew.  It is ridiculous.  Yeah.  It's a stupid concept.  I don't know how it started.  I don't know.  Ray, if you want any of those guys kicked out, we can do it immediately for you.  No problem.  Which one?  Why don't you just pick one for five?  Point one guy out.  Be like Caesar.  For what?  And just put your thumb down and kick him right out.  Yeah, we'll be on the street in 10 seconds.  He'll go.  You just point one out.  Point one out.  He's not going to pick a guy.  Why not?  Why not?  Come on, Ray.  Pick someone.  Do you feed them? 
[02:20:00]  No.  So they just come.  They look well fed, right?  They just show up, yeah.  They look well fed.  I think that ain't right.  I think they knew you were coming in here today, so, you know.  I saw the movie, man.  I didn't want to go because it was 6 o'clock, and I was like, I don't want to go to a movie.  And my girlfriend's like, let's just go.  I swear to you, I fucking howled watching the movie.  I howled.  Observe and report?  Really laughed out loud, yeah.  I mean, it was, I was like, if I didn't like it, I wouldn't have said that because I love you. 
[02:20:30]  But I loved the fucking movie.  I really loved the movie.  It made me laugh harder than any comedy I've seen in years.  It was so nice to see.  Are we rolling now?  Yes, we're on the air.  I'm good.  Go on.  Go on.  More people laugh at that.  It made me laugh.  It was so nice to see a non-goofy, non-cutesy guy comedy.  It was ballsy.  Yeah, it was ballsy.  The language was harsh.  There was funny violence in it.  It was just, it was everything that comedies had been missing. 
[02:21:00]  It was the exact opposite of every fruity goofball comedy that's come out in the last five years.  I loved it.  I fucking loved it.  Thanks, man.  Really loved it.  A rousing endorsement.  Yeah, it was nice to be able to say that, because I was like, what am I going to say  if I don't like it?  That's why he's like, you know, sometimes people come in, you don't want to bash the movie if  you like the guy.  Yeah, very funny and very violent.  That's what E-Roc said.  But in a funny way.  It wasn't like gratuitous.  No, that's a compliment too, as far as the violence goes.  I just said there's a scene where people are getting skateboards broke across their faces.  And there was no like, no like wacky little donks on the head. 
[02:21:30]  It was like, they're in a golf cart.  It's mad.  This is brutal.  He swings a skateboard, and it actually breaks on the back of a kid's head, and he just  collapses on the concrete.  It was a really funny movie.  And you didn't like Step Brothers when they made him lick the dog shit?  I didn't see the whole movie.  Did you see the movie Step Brothers?  Yeah.  It's like the funniest fucking thing I'd ever seen, and he said he didn't like it.  No, I just saw the bunk bed scene, and it was just like, oh.  What the fuck?  That's one fucking scene.  But they made me not want to see it.  It was like, oh, the two adults.  There's all the money we had, Karen. 
[02:22:00]  There we go.  Oh, my God.  There we go.  I knew that.  I'm sorry.  I knew that was coming.  Ray, you're well represented on this show.  I'm on his lines every single morning.  Jimmy, could you put this down for me?  So just so me and Ray are.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sure.  ACDC album cover with the little bars across our eyes.  Ray, I want to apologize, but he does these impressions.  You'd think it was the real people.  I'm like, that's an unbelievable Christopher Walken. 
[02:22:30]  Last time I saw you was in the Palisades.  You really are a funny guy.  The last time I saw Ray, we were both waiting for our kids to come out of either dance or karate,  and we just both looked defeated.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm waiting for my spastic white belt to come out.  I think your daughter was in like a dance thing, maybe?  I think.  I don't even remember.  We just both were sitting there.  It was just the most like, hey.  Hey.  Have you eaten at the new restaurant there? 
[02:23:00]  No, but I go to Mogens all the time.  Taste.  It's pretty good.  It's called Taste.  Taste.  Taste.  Good name for a restaurant.  It's great.  I don't like the sauce.  It's like the perfect, if you're like a stoner, like me.  You go, what do you want to eat?  Taste.  Taste.  Taste.  I can't eat Mayberry again.  I'll kill myself.  You know what's odd?  The first thing I thought when I heard you were coming in was we had a moment where we 
[02:23:30]  were telling people to call in with their fame.  We wanted to know if any famous people were listening to our show when we first got to  New York.  And this guy called up and he said, I was in Goodfellas.  And we're like, holy shit.  You know, we love that movie.  Great.  He turned out to be the guy that when you go across the street and pistol whip that asshole  across the street.  You want some of this fucko?  He's the guy that goes, don't shoot.  That was his whole line of the movie.  He was just the guy.  It wasn't even the guy that you hit. 
[02:24:00]  It was the guy that went, don't shoot when you wave the gun around.  And we were just like, fuck, you're in Goodfellas.  We were all just like freaking out that he was in it.  But he had no story.  I think it was like the second, third crew or some shit like that.  I was like, how was it to work with Ray?  It's like, I don't know.  I didn't say two words to him.  I didn't say him.  I didn't do anything.  Don't shoot.  That was a perfect movie.  It was a big line.  Well, everybody, of course.  I was surprised to read it.  You watched it like three times total?  Well, if that.  If that.  And it was because you have a problem watching yourself alone? 
[02:24:30]  It's just weird.  It's just, I don't know.  It's a good movie.  You should check it out.  It's so weird.  Do you pick yourself apart when you watch something you've done?  Can I know why I look at my body of work?  I do a lot of one line in a movie, and I'll pick it apart constantly.  Do you pick apart what you do and go like, I wish I had done that different?  That was a.  No, it's not so much that.  I just don't think it's healthy for an actor to watch themselves.  And it's weird.  Just sitting there.  I had a friend who he would call people over to like his movie or TV show was coming on. 
[02:25:00]  He'd have like a crew of people sitting there watching them.  You have to.  It's satellite.  Nobody's listening.  It's satellite radio.  Thanks, Jay.  You got to say it.  Come on.  That's a little.  Is it Nicholson?  I don't know.  He loves people to come over and watch stuff.  I would too much.  I started in Cuckoo's Nest.  I mean, he has a nice body of work.  Dice will do that with his home movies.  He has us come over and go, hey, watch.  And it's just him filming his friends.  Come on over. 
[02:25:30]  I got new glasses.  Here's me at the pool.  Hey, Jake-off.  Watch the movie.  Hey, I'm over here now.  You look all bored.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, well, Dice loves it.  His is pretty good.  I pound Dice all the time at that point.  Do you do him?  You don't do him.  Do you do Dice?  Well, not as good as Anthony does, for sure.  It's pretty.  Hey, thank you.  Hey.  Fuck off, bitch.  You know, I was in Vegas, and I was down a lot of money playing blackjack.  And he was there, and he heard I was there. 
[02:26:00]  He came over, and I guess he used to play a lot, and he got me even.  In like a half hour.  Really?  Dice?  Really knows his stuff.  You got 16.  You're going to want to hit that.  I don't want to hit 16.  Listen to the Dice, man.  A gig gig.  I'm not going to listen to the Asians sitting here yelling at me smoking a cigar.  Like an Asian would smoke a cigar and pass up a perfectly good Marlboro Red.  They loved their Marlboro Reds. 
[02:26:30]  I can't sit at a blackjack table without dying.  Oh, when I was watching the World Baseball Classic, it was Korea versus Japan.  I was like, how many Marlboro Reds are hidden in that dugout?  All those 140-pound baseball players choking back Marlboro Reds, waiting for Cecil Fielder  to show up and save their season.  Godzilla Bat 4.  I don't know why my Asian guy's deaf.  Godzilla Bat 4.  What else was I reading about? 
[02:27:00]  What was the horror movie you did with John Cusack?  I can't remember the name of it, but I loved it.  Oh, yeah.  Identity.  I liked that movie, man.  I was twisted.  That was great.  There's a dead guy in your freezer, Larry.  I was like, fucking Larry did it.  Larry was the killer, right?  You don't remember.  You don't watch it.  If you didn't see Goodfellas, why the fuck would you watch Identity?  You don't watch it?  You just watch movies with other people in it?  Pretty much.  Yeah?  Yeah, I like God. 
[02:27:30]  I just don't like that.  Fan of the movie?  Yeah.  I'll watch a movie that I'm in, but I don't understand why anybody...  I'm sure you'll agree with me on this.  At lunchtime, when you do a movie, they'll go, are you coming to Daly's?  What the fuck am I going to come watch?  I could be taking a nap, and instead I could watch 16 versions of the side of my head, while  the other person's like, yeah, I'm going to go to Daly's so I can help out.  And all you do at Daly's is go, wow, I really fucking blew that.  That's all you do.  You make yourself crazy.  And then at least when you watch the movie, you can go, hey, that's the editor. 
[02:28:00]  Fuck him.  He fucking totally blew it, the editor.  He picked the wrong take.  He cut right in the middle of the good part.  Everyone knows all my best scene.  Everyone knows all my best crying is off camera.  What does he do over there?  Nothing.  Oh, Travis?  Travis.  Travis is just trolling the internet for pornography.  He just lurched behind that and pretends he's a heterosexual.  He's not.  What was the Madeline Stone movie you did?  Who was that?  Was that Kurt Russell?  A Lawful Entry, yeah.  Oh, was that great?  I had a thing for her.  She was fantastic. 
[02:28:30]  And oh, you play a great psychopath.  Yeah.  You really made a cuck.  Yeah, well, yeah.  I haven't seen that one either.  What's that?  I never saw Field of Dreams.  Oh, how?  I forget Field of Dreams.  Oh, you just didn't want to watch it?  Yeah, there was just stuff going on.  What do you watch, though?  WrestleMania 11 was on.  How do you not see Field of Dreams?  What's a movie that you would rent and watch or buy and watch that you would watch more than once?  I don't know. 
[02:29:00]  Not many.  Any of your?  Which one of your movies would you say you've actually seen the most, even if it was by accident?  Maybe, probably Goodfellas, like three times.  It took me like two or three times just to realize I was in it.  It's a perfect film, right?  You realize you're in it a lot.  You're in an actual perfect film.  Like you're in an actual, put it in a time capsule, it's perfection.  Maybe I should see it.  Yeah, you should take a look at that. 
[02:29:30]  It's fucking perfect.  It sounds like he doesn't really like movies.  No, I do.  I love going to movies.  I like crafts, mostly.  Right.  I do movies to subsidize my crafting.  What movies do you like?  Have you seen any movies lately?  I see all of them.  Oh, really?  You'll see I Love You, Man, today, probably.  How was that?  I liked it.  I wouldn't see that.  I like Jason Segel, but it just, to me, it might be great, but I tend to like brutality  and humor, and that was why.  Oh, that's why you like this one.  I love this one. 
[02:30:00]  Jimmy loved this film.  Dude, I never laugh out loud watching.  I think the last movie that made me laugh out loud watching.  Where did you see it?  A screening?  There was a screening, yeah, that a lot of the bigger celebs were invited to, so I  said, all right, fuck it, I'll go.  Jimmy Twittered it to everybody.  I did.  I Twittered like a 13-year-old girl.  I found out like 12.30 in the morning that Jimmy loved the movie.  I laughed.  The last thing I laughed out loud at was probably something about Mary made me laugh out loud  and used cars.  I don't laugh out loud at comedies.  Most of them are just awful, and you give them the polite, like... 
[02:30:30]  Ooh.  It's a little Jamaican kind of sound.  Where did that come from?  I don't know.  Is that Jason?  No, I'm just glad we all hear it.  Is our stupid audience mic'd?  I'm just glad we all heard it.  I thought it was just me.  Trying to cruise.  I've never seen a full Seth Rogen movie until...  Can somebody answer the fucking phone?  What is that?  It's not in the headsets.  It's you, you dope.  Who's jacket?  Is that Danny's jacket?  Let's step on his phone.  That sounds like something Danny would have on his... 
[02:31:00]  Wow, that made us all nuts immediately.  Is it?  Oh, wow.  That's what it is.  That's Danny's phone?  Is that Danny's jacket?  Answer the phone.  Maybe it's his mom.  Oh, shit.  Just through his phone.  There it is.  What an ass.  It's among the oatmeal, so have fun with that.  Where did you guys film this movie, Ray?  Albuquerque.  How'd you like Albuquerque?  Oh, Jesus.  It's okay.  Oh, boy.  I did two days in a... 
[02:31:30]  Really?  For what?  Something that'll never come out.  Is your show still on?  Yeah.  I like it.  It's very funny.  Thank you, brother.  I was in Albuquerque for two days in the summer, and you know when guys get off of a construction  site, they break balls.  They're like, well, go fuck you.  I'll see you Monday, you cocksucker.  And they do those break balls.  In Albuquerque, it's like actual zombies being set free.  And you're shooting a movie on...  There's only two streets in Albuquerque with all those bars on them and stuff and little  alien bars and like, hey, we got alien jerky. 
[02:32:00]  Everything's an alien theme.  Yeah, Roswell.  Or like, there's a salamander on the wall theme, right?  Right.  And these guys...  Usually when you do a movie, somebody will walk across and you go, well, could you cross  the street?  We're filming a movie.  And they go, oh, really?  Wow.  Like, what are you filming?  Because it's fucking Albuquerque.  You'd think they'd be a little...  These people just like...  Like your children when they're tired.  You go, go put your shoes on.  And they just turn their heads and walk in the other direction.  You go, could you cross the street?  We're filming a movie.  And they would just walk into traffic like, please kill me.  Run me over.  It was really a depressing place. 
[02:32:30]  And I lost my fucking wallet in that fucking hotel in Albuquerque.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  So you'll go to your own premiere or no?  Yeah, I'll do that.  Yeah.  Are you kind of required to do that?  I will.  Just put the garbage can outside, please.  Jesus.  I swear someone's going to die.  Why are we acting like we don't know how to move a phone?  Put the garbage can in the other room.  Poor Ray.  It kind of works, though, with what's going on.  Are you guys always here?  I'm here every day.  He is.  I'm just in town sleeping, mostly. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, Jay's been on our show forever.  I was promoting my show on all the, you know, like The View and all those shows.  And then I looked at my wife and I said, let's just stay an extra week and sleep.  Because how often do you just get to sleep?  Jay's been coming on our show for years, though.  I mean, like.  Back in the day, Ray.  Ten years.  The first time I ever went on their show was when they were on another station that was not Satellite.  And I said, right where Jimmy's sitting, and a girl laid here and had her labia pierced in my face.  Oh, yeah.  And I went, these are my guys.  The good old days. 
[02:33:30]  And that was regular FM radio.  Yeah.  You'd get away with everything back then.  The girl just sat there talking to me.  And the guy's got like the, you know, a hole puncher in his hand.  And he just pulls his labia.  He's like, hold this for me.  I said, no.  I said, no.  And then he just went, kind of clank.  And the girl goes, ah, that's nice.  Yeah, done.  No real pain.  She just went with this.  Yeah.  And then I went home and masturbated.  And now you can't do anything on FM radio at all.  Is that why you keep ringing the bell on me when I mention the blacks? 
[02:34:00]  No, that keeps me safe.  Is that the inappropriate bell?  Yeah.  As long as I ring the bell, over the years, it's been like, hey, I don't agree.  You're letting the bosses know that I don't approve of what this person's saying.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, I'll hold a clam rally.  I don't get that loud.  I have an acting question to ask, Ray, because, again, I dabble in the acting a little bit.  Jay's a very good actor.  How do you know?  And I ask this to every major actor that we interview.  What do you do with your hands when you're acting?  Because that's my problem.  I love that question.  It's a very – I get very – 
[02:34:30]  I know exactly what you mean.  Most people put their hands in their pocket.  You can get the old defensive thing that depending on what – it depends on what it is.  The guy you're playing, how would it be?  But do you ever – like, are you conscious of your hands?  Because I'm just thinking, like, as I'm talking, I'm just thinking, do something with hands.  They're just kind of hanging stiff.  And I'm like, this is not normal.  And then I move them in the wrong – like, do you –  Well, I wasn't, but probably now I will be.  Yeah, you just ruined his whole career now.  I know exactly what you mean because you can see it with people.  So, I don't know.  I'll have to figure that one out. 
[02:35:00]  All right, here's a question.  That is a dead giveaway, though, of somebody that looks awkward.  Whenever you see a sports figure trying to act in a show, they just look real stiff  because they don't know what to do with their hands.  Trying to catch a football.  They're in the Heisman Trophy position.  With the parts I play, my hands are usually around someone's neck.  Holding a gun or throwing a punch.  There was a great – I won't give away the scene,  but one thing I like about Observe and Report was the language in it.  It was not typical, you know, just a sweet, boyish humor type of soft comedy language. 
[02:35:30]  It was some really great – there's a scene where Ray is screaming,  and just the guy you're screaming at, you're like, you fucking faggot,  and you call him a retard.  I'm like, it's so great to hear an angry guy –  Refreshing.  Yelling that.  And I laughed.  And, you know, of course, Jeffrey Lyons was right in front of me,  and I didn't hear him laugh out loud, but I fucking howled when I heard that.  But I don't care what the critics say, whether they like it or don't like it,  I don't know how they're going to react to it,  because they're typically babies when it comes to harsh humor.  But, man, that movie made me laugh. 
[02:36:00]  I'm not going to stop talking about this movie long after you leave,  because it really was a funny movie.  You were telling us how funny it was before Ray came in,  and I thought maybe you were being sarcastic because you liked it so much.  Dude, Seth Rogen.  I thought he was breaking my balls.  I was like, wait till you see this movie.  It's amazing.  I was like, okay.  Jimmy's a tough critic, Ray.  He's a tough critic.  I've never laughed at comedies because they're so cute.  They make guys look like a bunch of fruits.  We're all just big grown-up teenagers, the hoop, the hoop.  The girl gets the better of us.  We learn a lesson like a bunch of pussies,  and this was just fucking brutal. 
[02:36:30]  Just really good, man.  Great comedy.  What did you do with your hands in this movie, Ray?  I was choking Seth a lot.  Yeah, there was a really great fucking cop fighting scene at the end.  Jimmy had the best take on acting I ever heard,  and it's always how I always felt.  When people go like, what are you doing?  How do you act?  And you said, here's me when I'm acting.  Not my turn.  Not my turn.  Not my turn.  Go.  That's what I do.  Not my turn.  Not my turn.  And I was in my car listening in L.A., 
[02:37:00]  and I went, that's exactly what I fucking do.  I'm not listening to anybody.  I'm just trying to remember what I say when it's my turn.  I listen to their out cue.  Roses.  I had a story about, I think it was Robert Duvall said it.  You know when you're getting ready to,  you're just marking everything,  and you're not really doing it.  So Duvall will go, all right, bullshit, bullshit, my line.  Bullshit, bullshit, my line.  I'm a man without a company.  Have you ever been in a scene with anybody you were intimidated by?  Or like that you felt like you weren't, 
[02:37:30]  like why am I in a scene with this guy,  whether it was Daniel or Pesciro?  Dennis Leary.  He was fucking horrified of the wit of Dennis.  No, I can't say that.  I kind of get excited by it.  Ray, you know what's creepy about your laugh is how quick it ends.  Like explosive laughter and fucking back to business.  No, I've never been in a scene with anybody.  That's funny. 
[02:38:00]  What do you mean by that?  He's just like funny.  Well, I'm here for your fucking amusement,  like I'm a fucking jerk.  No, it's just what he says.  Like, it's funny.  No, I don't know.  You fucking said it.  He's a big fucking boy, Anthony.  Let him speak for himself.  You know what's great in Good Bands?  Poor Anthony's getting it all the time from him.  Anthony has two lines in the whole movie.  Both of them are off camera.  One is, hey, Joey, you got it all wrong.  At the table.  And he goes, he's a big fucking boy, Anthony.  Let him speak for himself. 
[02:38:30]  And then you shot him in the foot.  He goes, what do you want?  I'm a good shot.  How could you miss from this distance?  You got a problem with what I did, Anthony?  No.  Like, Anthony wants no fucking problems with Pesci and Goodfellas.  You got a problem with what I did, Anthony?  No.  You know, so many people have seen the movie so many times.  And there's one thing I've, I guess since you're here, I'll ask you.  It's that shot where you and Karen are going into the cope, I guess. 
[02:39:00]  That is one shot.  Yeah.  How many times did you do it?  I got to know how many fucking times that took.  You do slip at one point, which is pretty funny.  Probably like three or four.  They had rehearsed it all morning.  And then when we got there in the afternoon, we just, probably three or four times.  But you know, there's like one, you know, extra, like, fucking facing the wrong way.  It's amazing because it goes on and you realize where that starts and where it ends.  It starts across the street.  I think one of the things that happened, we come in, we go through the kitchen. 
[02:39:30]  You two.  Always you two.  And who was it?  It was Henny Youngman that was, and we did the shot and it was going perfect.  And I think he forgot his own joke.  We had to do it again.  We had to choose.  Can you imagine?  You get the end of that long ass shot, a huge long shot.  Henny Youngman goes, I love my next line.  I love his go-to. 
[02:40:00]  I love this crowd.  That would get everybody fired up.  Comedy was so easy then.  That is where it finally cuts off.  It's like, as Henny's kind of doing it, maybe that's why.  Maybe he screwed up his line.  All right, show a plane landing at Idlewild.  Oh, so who were you ever intimidated acting with?  Jimmy, you and I cut you off.  Or were you ever like, just like in awe of somebody like, this is De Niro I'm talking to.  Yeah, there was definitely that.  That was like my fourth movie.  And I did what I do, Hannibal with Anthony Hopkins. 
[02:40:30]  That was kind of fun.  And I wonder how that's going to be.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't you get your head sliced?  Yes.  Oh, you're having your brain eaten?  Oh, that's right.  The brains were getting eaten, yeah.  Were you taped to the chair at all?  He was cooking it.  Were you glued to a chair?  Or was that another character?  That was what you did.  No, I auditioned for that.  No, no, no, but what was the thing that you did with Dennis and Christopher Walken?  Duct-taped Walken to the chair, yeah.  I like that movie.  He cut off his finger.  Suicide Kings. 
[02:41:00]  I went to throw a bird.  There was a bird in the house when we were shooting the movie.  Like some crow got in the house.  There's that one house in Compton that everybody films in.  And every time he went to talk, it's like, the sound guys run Hollywood.  Like if a chipmunk farts in the woods, it's like, can we do this 16 more times?  Because there's chipmunks farting in fucking Lake Elsinore.  So this bird is ruining the movie, basically.  And we're there all day.  And we've all been in one room for like a month.  We hate each other at this point. 
[02:41:30]  And this bird's going, blah, blah.  So I pick up a rock and I go to throw it at the bird and Walken grabs my arm and goes,  don't do that, Jay.  He could have babies.  It's a true story.  But it also lets you know, like, he's got a good sweetheart.  Yeah, that's funny.  I go, tell me about your wife.  And he goes, who, bitch?  She's a horrible woman. 
[02:42:00]  Holy shit.  Ah, you're going to have babies.  Do you get sick of hearing about Goodfellas or no?  No.  No, not at all.  Because a lot of guys don't want to talk.  They're like, yeah, yeah.  They don't want to talk about the big.  Yeah, man.  And if I did that, then you'd really be busting my job.  Right.  Not well after you left.  It's over.  We'd be going, yeah.  Good.  We're going to talk about Goodfellas.  And the guy was like being all shitty about it.  Yeah, we're worms in person.  We really are.  We're weasels.  Okay, good point.  We'll talk about it.  And then we get fucking balls after somebody leaves.  We're really big on the way out the door.  But while you're here, it's fucking worms.  I do kind of. 
[02:42:30]  You got to think of it in layman's terms sometimes.  And you think of when you talk to somebody about a great movie like that.  Kind of try to think back to that year.  And think if someone asked you about, you know, your fucking job at the deli or something.  It's like, do you remember that sandwich you made?  It was fucking perfect.  You wrestled a kid from Paramus Park.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like, wait.  God, that was so long ago.  It's a great memory.  Where did you go to high school?  You're from Jersey, right?  Union.  Union High.  Big water tower in Union.  Exactly. 
[02:43:00]  Exactly.  Jay knows all the Jersey.  Garden State Parkway.  Big water tower.  It says Union.  And it's a regional school.  That's why they have such good football.  They cheat.  They got 16 towns spiraling into Union High School.  No.  It's a great water.  Fuck you, they don't.  What are you talking about?  Are you telling me only people that live in Union go to Union High School?  Exactly.  All right.  Well, then I'm wrong.  I apologize.  I had a threesome in Union.  Did you?  Yeah, years ago.  I responded to a newspaper ad for a woman.  And then she wrote back and she goes, this was back in the day when they had newspaper ads.  And she wrote back and she goes, well, I'm married, but I wanted straight guys. 
[02:43:30]  And my husband kind of wants to watch.  Ew.  And her husband.  I thought you meant two girls and a guy.  No, this is kind of harder when she get a.  Go ahead.  He didn't participate.  Don't listen to him.  Go ahead, sweetie.  He looked like a pizza maker.  He had an awful.  He actually looked a little bit like Duval.  He had like a complete horseshoe.  And he just sat there creepily close watching.  It was really uncomfortable.  Give her a good one, sports fans.  Come on, hug.  Come on, squirt.  Give me a little squirt hugs.  Is he sick?  No.  Is he sick?  Why? 
[02:44:00]  What have you heard?  He hasn't said anything.  I'm just enjoying today.  He's fezzing.  I threw a little fez today.  Hey.  So you had a threesome?  I did have a threesome.  It was more of a twosome with a creepy observer.  Like I kind of wanted him to go.  Because you know that they had talked.  Yeah, it was.  Was she pretty at all?  No, she was.  I was like, I'm 40 now.  She was probably, I was 21, 22.  And she might have been 38 at the time.  But see, that's something that I would, that would, you know, back in the day, that would  certainly intrigue me. 
[02:44:30]  Just to do a guy in front of his wife and just look over.  Do a guy in front of his wife.  To do a guy in front of his wife.  Wait, wait a minute.  How did you do it?  No one has, no one is that great as a comic.  That just kind of slipped.  No one tied that.  You weren't here when I fucking made Patrice my bitch.  Look at him.  He's red as a bee.  Really? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  That was a good slip.  No, but what do you mean?  You didn't do the guy?  No.  We ain't letting you off the hook.  Now you're a fucking part of the show, Mr. Talky Pants.  Fucking two hours.  I don't know.  I didn't see it.  I don't know.  I didn't see it.  We got you now, Jay.  No, I didn't do the guy, Jay.  Why not?  Why not?  Because that's not what I wanted.  Have you ever answered an ad where it was like, here's a couple. 
[02:45:30]  We want to do it.  You know, maybe you're in Montreal.  You're making a movie.  You're away from your family.  And you go, oh, I'll go up and I'll have sex with her.  Or maybe whatever happens with this guy happens.  No, no, no, no way.  Come on.  No way.  Straight to trannies.  I don't play games.  Jimmy has a long extensive history with the trannies.  Who doesn't?  It's only a gentleman's good preference.  What?  We lost one of your guys, Ray, because of that story.  She's out.  She's done.  No, I think we got some other thing to do.  Yeah.  Ray, how long are you in town for? 
[02:46:00]  Till Friday.  You're not going to be in New Jersey April 8th?  No.  Ah, to catch Jay Moore.  Yeah, Jay Moore on stage.  Where are you going to be?  Count Basie Theatre, Ray.  Where?  Count Basie Theatre.  Red Bank.  Red Bank.  Really?  Morristown.  But so you went to Union High?  Yeah.  All right.  It's not regional.  Are you going to give him directions?  No.  But this is what a great actor he is.  Because you said, because the fact that you're going to be in, you couldn't have cared  less that you're going to be performing at Red Bank.  And he was like, what?  Really?  I was like, God damn it.  Ray's going to be here.  No, I think Ray would actually enjoy it. 
[02:46:30]  I told you that.  He would enjoy it, but he's promoting a movie.  He's not going to be here April 8th.  He's doing things.  You're going to fuck you, Jimmy.  I'm telling you.  He's doing things.  Fucking jerk.  You couldn't fuck the guy, too?  Whoa!  You're going to take that?  You couldn't fuck the guy?  He said he looked like a pizza man.  He was awful.  What do you mean?  He sat too close.  He wasn't a 20-year-old Brazilian boy.  Then, eh, what happens?  Get up.  You slip.  No one's looking.  Was he masturbating?  I don't know.  Yes, you do.  No, I don't.  Does anyone remember Ray saying he's got to go?  Yeah, that was a while ago.  We're acting like it happened. 
[02:47:00]  We want people to think that Ray might be at Jay's show, because that helps ticket sales.  If I was here, I would definitely go.  See?  There you go.  See?  I like all the impressions and stuff.  I'll see you at the Highlands outside the dance studio.  He's quick.  Yeah.  I hope Ray had fun.  I have a photo with Ray that I'm going to ask him to sign after.  Do you remember this moment, Ray?  I'm like, can we guess?  Oh, I thought he was the guy with the wife.  No, but the look on his face, it was in Montreal at the comedy festival.  He was just like, no.  No, no. 
[02:47:30]  He doesn't remember.  No recollection.  No, no, no.  I do.  I do.  I do.  I remember.  I was there in Montreal.  He remembers being in Montreal.  At the comedy festival, right?  He just doesn't remember.  But he said at the comedy festival, and I can tell because you don't know what to do with your hands right now.  He's winding the cord around him.  Who's going to undo the phone cord now?  The big plug is...  Choking my thumb.  Ray has a lot of press.  The big plug is the movie is Observe and Report. 
[02:48:00]  And when does it come out?  Do you know when it comes out?  A week from Friday.  A week from Friday.  April 10th.  And it's nice.  Again, I would have lied because I like you so much, but God damn it.  It was a really funny movie.  And I said that this morning.  Like I said, Jimmy Twittered me like at 1230 that it was amazing.  What's a Twitter?  Twitter people.  You can take a picture, like a great excuse now.  Let me show you how I would Twitter.  It'll never be on yours or mine radar.  Twitter?  It's like an email to people that subscribe to your phone to get a message from you. 
[02:48:30]  And then I would kind of take a picture like for fans.  And then you could upload it to the computer.  You computer savvy at all?  No.  You fucking around the computer?  No, no, nothing.  It's fucking Reunion's Ray Liotta.  You don't ask him a fucking question like that.  I'm asking him if he uses the computer.  What the fuck is the matter with you?  Why do you think they closed the White Castle in Verona?  Because the guy's like you.  I don't know.  Apparently, he doesn't need eyes.  He doesn't watch anything.  You don't have to look at a computer.  He's going to watch Goodfellas now and go, those guys were right.  This movie's amazing. 
[02:49:00]  The Scorsese kid is good.  They're going to yank him out.  I mean, they're standing.  Their coats are on.  Their coats are on.  They've got to get out of here.  The great Ray Liotta.  Thank you so much for joining the report.  He's making him sign stuff.  That's two weeks from Friday, actually.  We're going to take a quick break and continue.  Opie and Anthony.  All right, Opie and Anthony.  Jay Moore killing today.  Ray Liotta was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  He looked good.  He looked great.  He looked really good.  And, dude, he's like a lot of those guys are just kind of quiet guys. 
[02:49:30]  You know, you walk into a room with a bunch of fucking guys and a bunch of lunatics watching you.  He really thought we were going to beat him up.  Yeah, he was like, you guys are going to jump, team up on me.  Are you two here all the time?  Yeah.  Yes.  He had a lot of questions.  Always.  He had a lot of questions.  You know what it is?  He's familiar with my work.  And that is what, like.  Oh, stop.  When he said that.  What?  When he came in and said that, it's just, it's always a nightmare.  A couple of fucking hate when people know.  And it has nothing to do with me.  Because, I mean, I guess it is me. 
[02:50:00]  What is it with Ed Norton?  How is he?  He likes you a lot.  Yeah.  He does enjoy me.  Edward, excuse me.  What kind of common last name is it?  People, I think what happens is, like, when celebrities see another celebrity, they just,  they feel like this is a person of similar ilk, and I can enjoy them.  You are a douche.  There were a few moments where the people behind Ray weren't thinking what we were doing.  Well, the content-wise.  They got a little nervous.  But the bottom line is, I don't care about publicists.  Just because when you look at the content of the movie he just did, it was rough. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, but it's a movie, not a radio show.  You do stuff on radio, and for some reason it's, like, all serious and real and fucking crazy.  Oh, nice one, Jay.  There you go.  Jay Moore, what a good thought.  You don't smell that?  Please, I don't care.  Jimmy doesn't care.  I was blowing it on you.  It doesn't mean nothing to me.  It smells like steamed dumplings.  I can smell that.  You smell that.  That smell.  Larry, who's an animal, Larry?  We were talking about, Jay was brought up when Ray Liotta laughs. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, it's spooky at how fast he turns it off.  Yeah, yeah.  It just does that laugh.  But while he's doing it, it's so familiar.  Like, you're looking and going, that's the laugh.  That's the one where he's like, oh, Tommy!  That's the laugh.  Jay's going to be in Red Bank, New Jersey, April 8th.  When Maury's getting choked by the phone cord and he's laughing.  Come on!  Where am I going to be April 9th, Opie?  Morristown, New Jersey, Jay. 
[02:51:30]  Community theater, yeah.  You ever played there, Jimmy?  I did.  Years ago, 2002, I did the Count Basie.  The Morristown one.  Oh, Art 5.  Doing an Art 5.  I'll play there, Art 5.  Brooks, shut up.  Morristown, I'm doing a September thing.  Is it nice?  I haven't done Morristown yet.  Count Basie's an older theater, but it's nice.  I took my sister to see Ray Charles at the Count Basie Theater, and he always hires local  guys because he's cheap.  He won't travel with his own band and fly them around, so he gets local guys from South  Jersey to play in his band. 
[02:52:00]  I got my sister, we were front, actually, from me to you to Ray Charles, right?  And the entire concert for an hour and a half, he's yelling at the bass player, who's this  big, fat, sweaty, white guy.  Just like, and they're all in their white tuxes, and this guy's playing bass.  Picture Steve Carlessi.  Not that Steve's fat, but just picture like a sweaty guy, like Steve just sitting there  playing bass.  And Ray Charles would go, Georgia E, motherfucker!  Georgia!  Who, goddammit! 
[02:52:30]  And he's like, he's going like this, the guy going, you gotta play a goddamn E card!  Like, for an hour and a half, this one guy.  And the guy just kept sweating more and more and more.  I'm gonna lay that fucking guitar over his head.  It was the biggest moment of his life, too.  It was.  And he was the guy sitting closest to Ray Charles.  E, motherfucker!  Goddammit!  E, motherfucker!  Let's go get!  Oh, stone your ass, motherfucker!  You say goddamn G-flat!  How was he live, though?  Terrible.  It was the most, it was really uncomfortable. 
[02:53:00]  Because of the band?  No, because of the way, I didn't notice the fucking basses missed an E!  Right.  Just fucking play, dummy!  Just shut up.  Get through it.  Yeah, who the fuck knows?  Hey, can we play the Jay Moore, Taylor Hicks publicist?  Yeah, I want to hear this.  I forgot about this.  But we had Taylor Hicks on.  And I think the publicist, it was getting a little crazy, so the publicist had to jump in.  And try to stop the direction of the show.  No, he had to go to another radio show.  Yeah, but I think they were also like, eh.  He was on a while.  Was he on a while? 
[02:53:30]  No, Taylor Hicks.  Oh, I remember.  Were you here for this, Jimmy?  I certainly was.  Let's take a listen.  We'll remember it together.  It was not comfortable.  No.  Are you guys doing any New York or New Jersey venues?  Yeah, of course.  You go to Americanidol.com and they'll find all the tour dates.  Yeah, he was here.  All good.  Everything's going to be great, man.  Girls.  You know, like I said, I went from performing in bars and little places to being on a stage  like this.  And it's a dream come true for me.  A lot like Jimmy. 
[02:54:00]  What kind of album are you going to do?  Like a soul album, obviously?  Yeah, soul, man.  Soul album.  My own album.  My stamp of approval.  Soul Patrol.  It's me that's gotten me here and I'm not changing.  Hey, I got a note.  I'll read it word for word.  A publicist called.  He has to move on now.  Damn it.  I guess they're not happy with how we're interviewing.  It's satellite radio, though.  So that's why.  She sounds like a real twat.  Publicists always do.  Publicists are usually cunts.  That's Anthony. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, stop the tape.  They're worried about it.  Stop the tape.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Back up a little bit.  I always close Jay that's the fuck throughout the first.  I say it to her face like a man.  Yeah, yeah.  I do it over the phone like a pussy.  No, no.  She was listening in.  Yeah, she was listening.  She heard your c-word.  Well, it really annoyed me.  And then Jay really hammered it home.  It annoyed me.  Yeah.  Because I just, I fucking hate publicists.  I really do.  They are not doing, a lot of times they're not doing what's in their client's best interest. 
[02:55:00]  No.  Which is to leave them sitting in this chair.  Yeah, they think they are, but they're not.  Yes.  So, hold on.  Let's go back to it.  We're interviewing.  It's satellite radio, though, so that's why.  She sounds like a real twat.  Publicists always do that.  Publicists are usually cunts.  Don't you agree with that, Taylor?  This is, I get, they're worried about you.  Well, no, I don't, I don't think it's, I, like I said, I've got about 15 more interviews  to do, so I think they're kind of just trying to move me along.  Fuck them.  What interview's next?  Fuck them in their fucking asses.  They are nothing but fucking clown shoes. 
[02:55:30]  Wow, that Jay was terrible.  I apologize to Jay Moore.  Holy shit.  What the fuck?  Was I drunk?  Yes.  No, no, you weren't.  All right, we'll go with it.  No, you weren't.  You woke up to pee.  And we jammed the interview in.  She's just trying to, she's just trying to, she's just trying to move Taylor along because  he has other press to do.  And it's like, wow, publicists are cunts.  Wow, I'm really.  All right, game over.  We got Kid Chris in Dallas. 
[02:56:00]  We got to move it along.  Fuck them in their asses.  Don't you agree, Taylor?  I'm on it off a Negro.  I'm in a Naughton.  Ed Naughton?  Ed Naughton?  I think for three years, I thought Jay ruined this for us.  No, apparently it was me completely.  Jay just jumped on at the end.  I listened to it.  You guys had this up like two years ago and you guys were debating it on air and I was  in my truck in LA and I was listening to it going, that's fucking Anthony.  Me?  What the fuck?  When you're right, you're right. 
[02:56:30]  Let's go back to it.  I think they're kind of just trying to move.  Fuck them.  What interview's next?  Fuck them in their fucking asses.  They are nothing but fucking clown shoes.  You're a cunt, lady.  You fucking bitch cunt.  Fuck you.  Jimmy.  That was Jay.  Hello?  We're never getting another guest again.  Ever, ever, ever.  You tagged it.  I rolled on Jimmy.  I said it when Jimmy.  Rewind it.  I said it.  Did you say that?  Yes.  I go, you fucking cunt.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, what are you doing? 
[02:57:00]  He totally threw him under the bus.  Let's go back to that.  Bitch cunt.  Fuck you.  Jimmy.  Chuck Wheaton.  Thrown under the bus.  April 9th, Morristown, New Jersey.  Oh, beautiful.  You can hear that live recording.  That's funny, man.  Ray Liotta, Tracy Morgan, Laura McDonald, and that fucking monster that was in here earlier.  Ray Liotta left his coffee here.  Let's get some DNA.  Oh, look at that.  And I have a picture to verify.  We should put that on next.  eBay already tweeted it. 
[02:57:30]  Got a couple of bucks.  Did you tweet yet?  I fucking tweeted probably sooner than you.  Wait.  I'm tweeted.  I was fucking voted boy who tweets quickest.  Quickest tweeter in town.  Can't argue then.  That's right.  I was voted by a voting body.  A voting body.  Is there anything left in that call?  No.  That was it?  No.  50 seconds left?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  All right.  Jay, you are a fan.  I enjoyed your book very much.  Thank you, man. 
[02:58:00]  Both of them.  Thanks, man.  I like your books.  Best-selling author.  Yeah, let's ignore it.  My book was on the LA Times best-selling list, and then when the paperback came out,  it didn't say LA Times best-seller list on it, and I called the publicist, the publisher,  and I said, why didn't you put LA Times best-seller on the cover?  He goes, well, we don't recognize regional newspapers.  It's the fucking LA Times.  I know.  They only care about the New York Times.  What is that?  The Houston Chronicle says it's a go-to.  It's a hoot.  It's a real page-turner. 
[02:58:30]  Isn't every fucking book a page-turner, you dummies?  You could have just wrote best-seller.  People wouldn't know exactly where.  They could have wrote best-seller.  The Cincinnati Examiner says, I read it.  I like when someone says it's a page-turner.  Yeah, exactly.  The other ones, I just look at the cover.  The cover, and then the back.  Yeah.  It's a real book-turner.  Don't bother to flip it over.  When was the last time you masturbated, Jimmy?  I jerked off a little bit. 
[02:59:00]  My girlfriend was at work.  A little bit?  A couple days ago.  Who's your girlfriend?  Nice girl?  Yeah, she's, I watched the Kit Kat Club.  She's very sweet.  Good, beautiful girl.  Kit Kat Club.  I got a stuffy nose, so I sound like that.  I met her.  I'm not a cop.  I just licked the side of her car door.  Why do you do it for just a little bit?  Because what happened was, it fucks me up sexually.  You were doing a little edging?  Yeah, if I jerk off too much, my dick doesn't function as well with a girl.  Like when I'm acting out sexually so much, my dick gets numb, and I get so used to, I  can only get, so if I don't jerk off for a while, and I lay off porn, then I fuck a 
[02:59:30]  lot better.  So I've been doing that with her, and the sex has been amazing.  Because I've been laying off porn, laying off jack-and-off, no hook, nothing.  Let it build up a little bit?  Yeah, but no, just, you get desensitized.  He says it like red meat for Lent.  I gave up prostitutes of questionable gender.  So I fucking just jerked off a little bit, looking at Craigs and stuff, and then I stopped.  I didn't let myself come. 
[03:00:00]  And then we had mediocre sex, and my dick was in and out, because I'd been abusing it.  But like, it gets better, like a day or two, I don't jerk off, I feel better.  And then like a week later, I'm good.  It just puts me on this fucking downward spiral, addiction-wise.  And it fucks it up.  It makes it hard for me to focus sexually.  You have to replace your addiction with something else.  She was right, though.  Mom was right.  I was masturbating once in a hotel room, and my wife was in the other room.  This is four years ago.  My wife was in the other room asleep, and we had had sex.  And I didn't want to wake her up. 
[03:00:30]  And she caught me.  And she goes, oh.  And she just goes, oh, I'm sorry.  And she backs out of the room and goes back to sleep.  And I'm just sitting there like, I'm a loser.  And then I go back to bed.  And I didn't finish, because it's no fun now.  Yeah, now it's wrecked.  And I go back to bed.  If you felt stupid then, you'd feel real stupid after you came.  Yeah, and I go back to bed.  And it's just completely awkward and weird.  And we've been together four months at this point.  We were in some hotel. 
[03:01:00]  And I go back to bed.  And I tried to do old JJ, just bullshit your way out, just lie to some woman,  but not realizing it's the woman.  Yeah.  And I go, no, it got stuck.  You know when you order a movie, it got stuck.  And she goes, I don't care at all.  But you realize I'm a sure thing.  Ooh.  And I went, oh.  So then.  Yeah.  They don't get it, Jay.  Women don't.  My girlfriend would get very mad at me. 
[03:01:30]  We had porn people in here.  And she was saying she got caught.  They get mad when we jerk off.  When a girl catches you jerking off, it makes the woman realize exactly how expendable she is.  It's like, do you understand that for all of your hard work in the gym  and everything you've done to make yourself you,  this stupid natural fist replaces you.  And they hate that.  They hate it.  But your girl will do anything, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  She's actually shy about certain things, 
[03:02:00]  but I'm turning her around like it's kind of nice.  She's like very open.  Literally.  If I start to masturbate, I'll go, what am I doing?  Yeah.  And then I just go in there.  Go in there.  Wake up.  Some fucking.  Yeah, but sometimes you want to jerk off thinking about or looking at something specifically.  It's like you can't just ask your girl.  We're sucking on another guy's.  What?  No.  A couple in Union, New Jersey.  No, they just, the guy just watched. 
[03:02:30]  He really did.  He kept his clothes on.  He didn't jerk off.  She was, I was 69ing with her and he got really close and watched.  And I was like, is he?  Oh, shit.  But he wasn't doing anything.  He really was just watching.  With his horseshoe?  That was awful.  Yeah, it was awful.  Oh, God damn.  Tom Hagen was watching me get my dicks up.  Oh, we're woffing going on.  No, why not, Jay?  You want to woff?  Oh, attaboy, Jay.  He's still woffing it over.  Jay picked up a piece of paper and stopped fanning it at Jimmy. 
[03:03:00]  Because Jimmy farted.  Egg whites.  It was egg whites.  Egg whites.  He was getting it towards him.  Why don't we do this?  Likes it.  We should do this 911 audio because it's like the story of the day.  Oh, this fucking guy.  Oh, have you heard this story yet?  No, uh, yes.  But, uh, April 9th, Morristown, New Jersey.  What about April 9th?  Wow, that really reeks.  I'm going to be performing there.  That just hit me.  All of a sudden, someone's got to play the one-up game.  He's reciprocating.  How hurtful that is.  It hurts.  Any more guests that we can switch seats?  It really stinks. 
[03:03:30]  You know what's funny?  Have you smelled?  Have you ever been on the phone?  I'm sorry, Oak.  No, go.  Have you ever been on the phone with your friends?  Yes!  Oh.  And you fart into the phone because it's funny.  And then you realize, five minutes later, I'm the only one putting this up to my face.  You want to smell liquid ass?  No.  Yeah, what is it?  I hate that shit.  You've heard it on the show, right?  I've heard it on the show.  Sam, bring in the liquid ass.  I'll do it over there.  It's just a bottle of P.U.?  It's disgusting, man.  What porn stars are in here that you were interested in?  Porn stars that I've been interested in? 
[03:04:00]  Well, you said you pointed over where...  Who's this guy?  Oh, that's Danny.  Danny?  It was his phone that was going off.  That fucking...  Jerk.  My friend, Danny.  That awful Jamaican jingle.  Dude, that's the last thing Natalie Holloway heard.  What are you selling?  He's in the East River selling coco-helados, coco-helados.  Why can't I just leave Holloway alone?  Peel the onion, kid.  The joke's never done.  Was that your alarm?  Yeah, I forgot to reset it.  It's what I wake up to because it's so obnoxious. 
[03:04:30]  You have to get out of bed.  I'll give you the obnoxious part.  Oh, it's awful.  I don't want to spray it.  I'll just smell it.  You know what the worst thing is?  It's not as bad if you just smell it.  You got to put it on paper.  It actually needs to be atomized a little bit.  It's got to go through the air.  No, it doesn't.  It's really bad.  Yes, it does.  It smells like actual dog shit.  Yeah, it's horrendous.  Should we atomize it on David?  Spray it in your hair.  Bring Big A in.  I'll give you 20 bucks to spray it in your hair.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Let's bring in David.  Okay. 
[03:05:00]  David!  Hey, your buddy said that wrestling was fake.  John Cena.  John Cena.  Can I spray it in his head?  Oh, look at poor David.  Look at poor David shaking his head.  David, get over here.  I'm not going to make...  Oy vey, why?  Jay Moore is a big star.  We haven't seen him in a long time.  David, why are you sitting?  David, David, why are you sitting?  I say David can sit.  He killed my Lord and Savior.  No.  We'd all be dead if it wasn't for my David.  David.  Yes.  Say hi to Jay Moore. 
[03:05:30]  Hi, David.  Hi, sweetie.  We said hi already.  We certainly did.  Have you smelled this before?  Many times.  No.  Many times I smelled it, yes.  Can we put a little on your shirt so you can smell it?  How about your sleeve?  A little sleeve.  It's a sleeve, David.  Not by your face.  Just by your sleeve.  I had a driver that was...  Oh, that stinks so fucking bad, dude.  Jay, look at his farts.  Liquid shit.  So long, jerk.  Give me that.  How'd it go?  So long.  Oh my God.  I got it on my hand, though. 
[03:06:00]  Did you lose it?  You didn't lose the fart face off.  You just lost it because of the little ass.  No, the spray.  No, it's so fucking bad.  It's got to go in that hair, dude.  I can't get it.  It's too bad.  Oh, don't be a queer.  It's like you wiped your ass and missed.  Put it in that Sideshow Bob head of yours.  I'm like the 40th person who used that reference.  It's so good.  Let me put it in your hair.  But it won't come out.  Yes, it will.  You wash it.  It's kind of fair, I guess.  Here, real quick.  Yeah, you try a punch, you can take it in the ass. 
[03:06:30]  Is it water-soluble?  Don't do me.  Hey, I got a meeting.  Don't fuck around.  That's hard, Jim.  Okay, get out of here.  No, go away, motherfucker.  Where?  Oh, fucking God.  Fucking hell.  So I got a story for David about a Jewish man I met.  There was a driver I had in Las Vegas after a corporate show.  All right.  And he was an Orthodox Jewish man.  And he said, so how do you get all these blessings?  He said to me as he was driving me around.  And then we're talking.  And this guy started talking to me about the Bible, David. 
[03:07:00]  He goes, you know, the story.  Can I stop for a second?  It's trying to spray his way back to the microphone.  I know.  It's like a machete.  Why are you still in here?  Go outside with your shit hair.  No, now you've got to smell it.  And then we can move on from your shit hair.  I smelled it.  I put it up to my nose and smelled it.  Now smell his shit hair.  No.  Please.  No.  All right.  Please.  Sam, let Jay smell your laugh.  Wow, this studio fucking stinks.  This studio fucking reeks. 
[03:07:30]  I faked it.  You faked it.  Get the fuck out of my head.  It was like dog poop.  It really is.  All right.  Tell the story, Jamie.  Tell the story.  Tell the story.  So I had to tell the story.  What the fuck are you doing?  Bert Kreischer sent me a picture of his dick.  I was at the Laker game talking to a Knicks game.  And Justin Tuck from the Giants is sitting next to me.  And I go, message.  And I knew what it was going to be.  And I open up a picture.  And it's Bert's cock.  And like a jerk, I go, look, my friend just sent me a picture of his cock to a fucking football player. 
[03:08:00]  And he just moved over a couple seats.  It's so terrible.  It's so bad.  Holy fuck.  So I was talking to this driver, David.  And he goes, what's the Yiddish word for blessings?  The brachas.  How do you have so much brachas?  Brachas, blessings.  Yeah.  And we're talking about it.  And we're just talking about, you know, just feel out, you know, whatever.  And the guy says to me, let me tell you a story.  Noah's son, one of his sons saw his father naked. 
[03:08:30]  You know this from the Talmud?  And he did not cover his father up.  The other, you know the story?  No, no.  What kind of Jew are you?  He's the worst Jew ever.  Oh, really?  He knows nothing.  He spells it G-E-W.  He goes, one of Moses' sons saw him naked and did not cover him up properly.  And maybe there was fellatio.  It's not said in the Talmud, but it's implied that there was an impromptu thing happening. 
[03:09:00]  The other sons come in and they cover up Noah.  But that son, for not covering up his father, was cursed by God.  His entire family lineage was cursed by God.  And that is the blacks.  And if you look, they're sexual deviants.  They cannot control themselves.  They're always holding themselves.  That is the God's curse from Noah's son. 
[03:09:30]  Did you know this story?  No.  Go get your shine box.  There's fucking smell in here.  Did you get some of that one?  By the way.  Of course it was.  That's fine with me.  I don't mind yours.  It's that bottle.  I don't like artificial.  I don't want to play on turf.  That's true.  I'm checking the Twitter times.  I Twittered my Ray Liotta picture at exactly 929.  Opie is then in second place at 930.  Jimmy coming in third at 931.  What happened?  It's not true, actually. 
[03:10:00]  It's true!  You just lost your title as quick as Twitter.  I Twittered faster than you.  When you go behind the scenes, that's AT&T's mistake.  I Twittered it at 918, but it took a while.  Because you know I've had problems with my motherfucking iPhone.  No, it's what is up here.  Share the sign, and it's in order.  Play the goddamn 9-1-1 tape, Opie.  I am the first Twitter.  No, you're not.  No.  Yes.  Nope.  Gentlemen, pick up your phones.  I don't have one.  I am the first Twitter.  No, we're using Jay.  All right.  Wait, put your phone down.  I'm not Twittering contest. 
[03:10:30]  Put your phone down.  What?  We're going to pick up our phones, take a picture.  I hope people come to my shows in New Jersey.  Twitter fucking quick draw?  Quick draw.  Jay, you're the subject.  Hey, hey.  How do I know when you want?  I'll put your phone down.  Jimmy, you fucking cheating cunt.  Jimmy's out.  Jimmy's out.  Jimmy's out now.  Where's my belt?  Fuck Jimmy's ass.  Jimmy's out.  Ready?  Someone say go.  And you've got to write something witty, too.  Okay.  What?  How long can you write?  You have to write the following.  What are you taking a picture of?  No, no, no, no, no. 
[03:11:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's fucking typing.  All right, just, well, you have to just say it.  Isn't Twittering typing?  How about Jay Moore and his bedhead?  You have to write that.  Say go.  Go.  Wait, wait, no, no.  Shut up.  I'm fucking typing up already.  I won, Twittered, Bing.  I'm the Twitter king.  I Twittered first.  Mine's going to be blurry.  Bing.  Is that picture of a penis your own, hopefully?  Of course it is.  Well, I don't know with you. 
[03:11:30]  Oh, please.  Doesn't have little kiss marks on it, does it?  There we go.  Look at that happy boy.  I Twittered first.  The winner of the Twitter.  Let me see how special.  Look how I look like a special person in every picture these days with my heavy face.  My big fat belly.  My special boy neck.  Oh, go on, Jay.  Said.  Done.  Let's see what pops up first.  I already fucking did it.  I won.  The winner is.  Why is my picture's really blurry, though?  Can I see it?  I got all panicky.  I got all panicky.  And you didn't feel like smiling for me, Jay.  I did a funny face. 
[03:12:00]  I just cannot type fast.  You looked sad.  I'm terrible with typing.  You type like a bitch.  You're not a bad typer, Mr. Gaston.  I'm up.  I'm up.  Already?  I'm in.  Why are comments disabled right now?  I'm loaded.  I don't even know what the fuck you guys are doing and what's happening.  I'm up and loaded.  9-51.  Should I be Twittering to all my fans?  Are comments disabled on yours, too?  Shut up.  You're right.  What?  No.  Comments are disabled for some reason.  I didn't disable them.  I did not disable them.  No, no.  Mine aren't.  Well, they always got it.  I got comments. 
[03:12:30]  They always got issues.  Is it the 911 call where the lady's biting her husband?  Yeah.  Yeah, it'll be back up.  Can I hear it?  I'm scared.  Let me see my picture.  Yes, it's Jay Morris, eh?  Are you up?  Yeah.  No, that's just what I could do.  No, no, no.  That's it.  Are you up, though?  Yeah, that's from...  I'm up.  I'm posted.  I'm up.  I'm posted.  Anthony beat you.  I'm up?  What's the times?  I'm on...  Well, I keep...  By the way, I'm Opie Radio on Twitter.  I keep reloading your page.  I'm Jim Norton.  Yours isn't even coming up.  It's not even coming up.  Ant is up. 
[03:13:00]  What?  It says about a half minute ago, which now is about a minute ago.  What the fuck is that about?  Now yours just came up 10 seconds ago.  Oh, now yours just came up.  You know why?  It's because Ops has to go through that service that he uses, Posterous, or whatever.  What about mine, Danny?  Benny?  Well, Posterous...  I'm on the network.  Posterous you could do some other things with.  I got people.  Hey, uh...  All right.  Who won?  Jim won.  I did.  Whose picture's better, though?  Jim's a little blurry.  Who's the best?  Jim fucking started, like, 10 minutes before...  Oh!  It's like charcoal! 
[03:13:30]  Couple beautiful girls.  Everyone's saying you won, Ant.  You won.  I know what you did.  Smoked some grass.  Smoked some grass.  Show me.  Don't talk back, you fuck.  I'll bring you in.  Bring you in.  Your daddy know you have his car?  Couple beautiful girls.  Are you serious?  Hey.  Eyes front!  That is...  He really should have been nominated for that movie.  I mean, he really should have been nominated. 
[03:14:00]  I'm weak!  I like when he looks at Christ and goes,  You fucking rat!  You rat fuck!  Where the fuck were you?  Where the fuck were you?  And he's kissing some big black lady's feet,  and she goes,  It's a holy thing.  Oh, god damn.  How could you?  Yeah, we got that good clip somewhere.  I'll get it.  Yeah, Danny will find it.  You can find that motherfucker.  How come there's no comments?  What?  Why are comments disabled?  Because that's...  I have no idea what... 
[03:14:30]  I have no idea what...  I don't know...  It's like, uh...  Oh my goodness, let me see the comments.  It's like I went into the future.  I have no idea what's happening.  Fuck Twitter and its butt.  I'm gonna look at Jimmy's comments.  I'm gonna, uh...  Be the Opie and Anthony radio show for a minute.  What do you want, Jimmy,  to look at comments on?  It's just comments temporarily disabled.  So for everybody listening,  this is the Opie and Anthony radio show.  We have a little Jimmy here.  Who the fuck?  Ray Liotta?  Want to thank Ray Liotta for coming by?  Want to thank that wrestler man?  No, we're still doing radio.  He was good.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Jay Moore's gonna be at the, uh... 
[03:15:00]  Count Basie Theater in Red Bay, April 8th.  Very funny Jay Moore.  And, uh, Morristown in the theater,  I don't know the name of, April 9th.  Jay Moore will be there.  Jaymoor.com for all your, uh, needs for that.  For all your Jay Moore needs, yes.  Gary Unmarried's on tonight  if you want to watch a sitcom.  Oh, right.  There you go.  What time is that?  8.30.  8.30.  Well, you guys are bullshitting.  I just sent out...  Who's fucking...  You're fucking bullshitting.  I just sent out the official picture  of me, Ann, and Jimmy  with Ray Liotta  to my followers on Twitter.  You didn't send out the official... 
[03:15:30]  Wait, how'd you get that?  What are you, John the Baptist?  What are you, followers?  Where'd you get that?  I just sent out the official picture.  But where'd you get the picture?  He, uh, E-Rock?  Oh, E-Rock mailed it to you?  If I don't have that picture  in my fucking email right now,  I swear, E-Rock's fired.  Well, while you look for it...  Here I go.  You guys sound like housewives  getting your hair burned.  Here I go.  You might as well go to OP Radio  and check out the official picture  of us with Ray Liotta.  Hold on, hold on.  I don't want to hear a word from you.  E-Rock.  Ah, and no fuck...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's loading, loading, loading.  Roll high.  Loading.  E-Rock, you better have it in my email, 
[03:16:00]  you fucking hat-wearing shitheader.  Eric Nagel, Ray 2, Attachment.  You got it?  Very good.  Do I have it, too?  You were sent first, both of them.  You know what?  Damn straight.  And then everyone else got there.  That's all cute,  but they're still in your phones.  My followers are already  looking at the picture,  so OP Radio on Twitter.  Holy mackerel.  How many followers do you have?  I know, isn't that the fucking...  Fucking David Koresh.  Followers.  I want more followers. 
[03:16:30]  People who just don't like me.  All right, let's go to the 911.  Eric, why do I only have one Ray Liotta picture?  Mr. Nagel,  why do I only have one Ray Liotta picture?  How many did you get?  You should have had both  and we sent it at the same time.  Oh, were they?  Look, the people on the message boards  are getting anxious right now.  Keep the show going.  The show sucks.  Why?  We finally realized  why should we give a shit  if they don't?  They think they're the show.  They really don't. 
[03:17:00]  They're really like delusional people.  Now they're going to be like,  Anthony, you agree with Jay?  Fuck him.  Fuck, fuck.  Speculate.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  OP's Twitter thread.  Oh, that's a good thing on OP's Twitter.  That means this and that.  I got one.  You're right.  I'll get the other one.  That's okay.  Why don't we take a break  and we'll do the nine.  They're replacing Jimmy with Greg Marmell.  Wow.  Well, I'm thinking of Steve Marmell.  I don't know Greg Marmell.  That's what I meant to say.  I'm a jerk.  Did you do it again?  I just am fucking bizarre.  They're in shock out there. 
[03:17:30]  Me and Ray, a couple of guineas  just standing there.  Nice, right?  Nice.  The good half, man.  Yeah, the good half.  All right, why don't we take a break?  We're going to finish up.  What problem are you, Henry?  You might wind up with a big piece of property  with this fucking problem.  We're going to...  We're going to...  Sorry.  We're going to...  Are you sick?  We're going to...  Are you sick?  Is he sick?  What a weird thing to ask.  I thought he was like a germaphobe or something.  I thought you were going to cough.  I thought you were like,  is he nuts?  Is his sense of humor crazy?  Yeah.  He's crazy. 
[03:18:00]  He's sick.  Is he sick?  I was just watching it  and having a good time  just checking it all out.  I can't get in when...  Yes, you can.  I try.  I have to get better at it.  No, it's fine.  I honestly don't care.  It's all good.  People love when you're on the show.  Let's just...  He goes, is he sick?  And I'm like, oh, me?  Thanks.  He's sick.  All right, we'll take a break.  You got a comment for everybody, though.  You know, the one for me was the best, but...  I know.  For me, it was like,  this guy, he's funny as shit.  Well, yeah.  Oh, yeah, the comedy thing?  Yeah, the comedy thing.  Yeah. 
[03:18:30]  I know.  Jay's going to be at Red Bank, New Jersey, April 8th.  Yes.  We know that.  Count Basie Theater.  And then Thursday, the 9th, Morristown, New Jersey.  Oh, by the way, for people that were asking...  Aha!  I knew that it was a bite away.  When people ask...  I was reading when people were asking,  like, why did Jim Jeffries cancel Washington, D.C.?  And why did Jay Moore cancel Washington, D.C.?  Because no one buys fucking tickets.  That's why...  Yeah.  It's not like we're busy.  We're comics.  We like to go to towns, make people laugh.  Shut the fuck up! 
[03:19:00]  Police activity!  Get back!  You've got to get the word out that you're doing comedy again.  That's the problem.  The word's out!  You go, you put it out, and then the promoter calls and goes,  look, we've got 40 tickets sold at the thing.  Ugh.  Not really.  We've got to get the word out better.  Yes.  I'm back.  Get it out there.  It is back.  Where's Dean Edwards on the phone?  We want the big Tracy Morgan showdown, but I don't know if it's happening today.  We'll see.  We're going to...  Dean Edwards sounds like a coward to me.  Back to the beginning. 
[03:19:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy's gone.  Oh, here comes Jimmy.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Jimmy.  And Jay Moore.  Who knows what he's up to?  I know, right? 
[03:20:00]  You know, I love when Jay's on the show, absolutely.  But man, I go home exhausted.  I go home exhausted.  And I mean that as a compliment.  For real.  How come Iraq didn't take any pictures when Ray was here?  In studio?  Ah.  See?  He got nervous.  Why didn't he?  I got a picture of you and Ray talking.  Did you?  Yeah.  How much you want for it?  I want $1,500 for it.  You mean how much I want to pay for it?  Yeah, how much you want to pay for it.  Where's Iraq?  Actually, it's already up there on my Twitter. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, is it cool?  See what I...  Is it a good picture or is it a blur?  That's why.  I'm responsible with my tweet.  Keeping the people informed.  Iraq!  E to the rock.  Why didn't...  Unless they said no pictures, but why didn't he get photos?  Why didn't we take video?  You know what?  We did.  Sam had a flip camera.  But why the flip and not the real video camera?  Because we're just like 92.3 now.  We're flip camming.  Two questions.  Why did you get pictures when Leo was in here?  Yeah, what's up, E?  Why didn't you snap some photos when Ray was in here?  Yeah.  Because the publicists were...  They wanted to approve the video.  They wanted to approve photos and all that stuff. 
[03:21:00]  What?  I didn't bother.  Okay.  No.  Why bother?  Sam got fucking video.  Yeah, we had to get permission.  I snapped the goddamn cell phone picture.  Because...  For us.  Just unplugged the goddamn thing.  Steve broke the big camera, so we're in...  How did he break it?  We're in Dutch with that right now.  How did he break the big camera?  He took it home.  He took it home and he said it doesn't work anymore.  Came to a grinding halt, as he said.  So we are camerawess.  So let's buy one.  We're fucking a radio show.  Let's do it.  Wait, he doesn't want to use his camera anymore?  He said it's broken. 
[03:21:30]  He's not buying a new one.  All right, so we'll buy one.  Yeah.  Yes.  You guys will buy one.  All right.  Let me break myself.  Let's do this 911 audio before we get out of here.  Nice crowd today.  Did they come for us or Ray Liotta?  Let's be honest with each other.  Ray?  Yeah.  They came for us.  Nah, it's a Ray Liotta thing.  Where's the girl that was there?  Our girl?  That's Janine.  Oh, that's her?  Yes!  Oh, she looked good.  She makes balloon animals now.  We should bust her balls a little bit.  Did she bring her balloons?  She did? 
[03:22:00]  Where's Janine?  Cool.  Does she know we're talking about her?  Can you get Jay Moore in here?  She was making balloons at FH Riley.  She had that stomach stably right now.  Jay's on the shitter.  Jay's on the shitter.  He farted so many times he shook the fucking mud loose.  Did you hear us talking about you?  No, I was in the ladies room.  Hello.  Were you dropping stew?  No.  Peace.  This is Janine.  She makes me very happy.  Hello.  You make me happy too.  She gives me a little sunshine in my soul when I see her. 
[03:22:30]  I don't know why.  Aww.  I don't know why, but you do.  And she's a regular at FH Riley's.  My brother's on Twitter now with the FH Riley's.  Really?  Yeah, his updates are terrific.  They must be great.  I'm working on my menu.  Great.  What do you do?  Wow.  No, he actually does pretty good with the FH Riley's Twittering.  But Janine really entertained a lot of drunks a couple weeks ago at FH Riley's by making balloons.  Jimmy, I'm doing this for you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was going to pee.  I didn't know what she was doing.  I brought her in for you.  Oh, hi, Janine.  Hi, Jeremy. 
[03:23:00]  I have to tangle.  Janine now makes balloon animals.  It's her job.  You didn't know we were going to do this.  Who pays you for that?  No.  A magician.  Look at her.  With magical disappearing money.  Look at her get all sown.  Oh, you know what, though?  I have something to show you.  It's kind of cool.  Yeah.  New animals that you can make?  No.  Hopefully it's a pin.  It is a balloon DeLorean.  You can make it?  No, I can't.  My boss does.  Full size.  Can we say it?  Did your boss make this one?  John at Magic Balloons and More in Hicksville, New York? 
[03:23:30]  Did your boss make this one?  He did.  He made that one at the Back to the Future Convention.  Make me a balloon animal.  Oh, that is amazing.  You guys want to see Janine make some balloon animals?  I don't know why I would do this.  I know it's radio, but last time we had it.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remember, Anthony, worst guest ever on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's a tie between Dustin Diamond and Balloon Animal Guy from Jersey.  Let's not forget.  And Steve the Whistler came in close to a third.  No, we made radio gold out of that.  But you know something?  He sucked.  Yeah, he did.  Tell his bitch to make a balloon animal.  Make a balloon animal, bitch.  What kind of a balloon animal? 
[03:24:00]  Whatever you can make.  Whatever's a cool one.  Jimmy, what kind of...  Can you do a snake?  No, Jimmy.  What kind of animal do you like?  You make a snake, a worm, and a centipede.  My favorite animal is the hard fork.  Could you make me a balloon animal?  You've got to see her little balloon belt.  Oh, I know.  She got a little...  I have my balloon belt.  This was so I could make Matt's babies a toy because they play with socks.  It's very sad.  Oh, let's go to a balloon for a baby.  He can wear it as a hat and suffocate himself.  Very smart thinking.  And then choke on the broken balloon. 
[03:24:30]  Great.  I used to make balloon porcupines, but they would always pop when I was putting the sticky  things in me.  I can't think of any words.  I don't know what you make.  Look at the balloon pump.  Look at her tiny little balloon pump.  Whatever you make.  What do you think?  What would be good for the radio?  Obviously, none of this.  Nothing is good for the radio.  Very good.  You learned quickly.  Can you make an octopus?  I could.  What?  I could make you a Disney princess.  Okay, a Disney princess.  Oh, she's already made a little mermaid. 
[03:25:00]  Could you make me a bigger dick so my girlfriend can finally not think of other guys when I  fuck her?  I missed that.  Boo.  It's all right.  Didn't miss much.  Boo.  Did you hear that one, Ant?  Okay, you guys can just talk amongst yourselves.  No, no.  We got to hear you blowing up the balloons.  Listen to this.  All right.  We have...  Is it on Pal Talk?  Pal Talk is...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me see.  I'll be shy.  You're on Pal Talk.  Jimmy's a little in the way because he almost kicked the camera over before.  I felt all nervous that Ray Liotta was here.  I wasn't nervous.  You came in.  You're like...  He kicks the tripod over for the camera. 
[03:25:30]  Ray Liotta's outside.  I told Anthony during the break, it's very rare at this point in our careers, but I was  intimidated by Ray Liotta.  Really?  And I have no problem saying it.  Yeah.  He's a nice guy.  But there...  It just is.  He's a big study.  He's in a fucking wild best movie he's ever made.  Oh, you don't give a shit because you're...  I'm drinking champagne with champagne cocktail.  I really think who the fuck I am, huh?  Is that a foot?  Are you making a dinosaur? 
[03:26:00]  What is that?  You're making a balloon tumor.  What?  Ow!  My face!  He's making the elephant, man.  Yeah, you should make weird balloons things.  Make me a balloon balloon thing.  Like what?  No, there would be like a market for that.  Fuck the animals and the stupid princess stuff.  Like you make like the elephant man and dumb stuff.  I'm still kind of new to this.  You make a balloon balloon.  I'm like the elephant man anyway.  How did you learn how to do this?  Anyone?  It caught me.  Yeah, could you make a...  I answered an ad for a magician's assistant because I thought it sounded cool. 
[03:26:30]  But when?  Like how long have you been doing this?  Since December.  So now how do you know if someone says make something you've never made before?  It has to be on the list.  You have a list?  I have a list.  I don't have it with me because I wasn't expecting you to do this.  You can't fucking ad-lib...  Did you scream me?  No, no, no.  No, no.  You can't ad-lib a balloon animal?  I kind of can.  It depends on the balloon.  Can you make a Tyrannosaurus?  No.  Like a T-Rex?  No?  Can you make more balloon noises, please?  Is that the most annoying noise?  Ever. 
[03:27:00]  Did I ever tell you when I operated Ted's Balloon Animal Emporium?  No.  I was very good.  My most popular model was the earthworm.  Yes.  I would paint little eyes on him.  And throw dirt on him.  Oh, there's a balloon.  I'm a little out of practice.  Wow, that is a big bag of balloons you got there.  I know.  It's my big belt of balloons.  I can't blow this fucking thing up.  What is this, made of metal?  Do you have to buy all those balloons? 
[03:27:30]  You gotta use the balloon pumps.  Or are they supplied to you?  They belong to my boss.  They belong to your boss.  They belong to that guy, John, at Magic Balloons and More.  Oh, shit.  You just got a raise.  These are fucking tough balloons.  Yeah, that's why she's got the balloon pump.  Would you like to use my pump?  How do I do it?  Use the little dog dick pump she's got there.  What do I do with this?  That.  Use the nozzle.  Jimmy's not used to putting a rubber on anything.  Jimmy.  Wow, Jimmy, you suck.  I'm making a balloon out of a look. 
[03:28:00]  Ted can't do it very...  Can I have that balloon?  Yes, I can.  He just lost his...  What is it?  He just lost his balloon hard-on.  Jimmy has made one little lump in his...  That's what I'm supposed to be making!  Mine's your goddamn beeswax!  He's got this long balloon that could probably blow up to about four feet long.  He put one little puff of air in it.  Yeah.  So now it's just this little fucking...  Isn't it cute?  ...bubble.  And the rest of the balloon hanging off of it. 
[03:28:30]  What have you made, Ted?  It's a balloon sperm!  Oh!  I see!  Look at this!  Who am I?  I'm the producer of the opium, Anthony!  That's right, it's on my back and neck!  By the way, Michael Smith from Harrisburg writes,  This is compelling radio.  Why would CBS not want to broadcast this?  Yes!  I'm down, Paul, right? 
[03:29:00]  Hello!  How's your shit, Jimmy?  Did your son have a famous Disney princess?  You gotta take the easy sit down.  This is the...  Did y'all take the old easy sit down?  I hate when you gotta do that.  I went to the stall that Jimmy was peeing in, and there was pee in the seat, so I used that one.  Jimmy will piss under the stall onto your feet, by the way, so...  Never pissing.  Jimmy knows what's funny.  Isn't it funny that things...  Lady, back...  What's your name, sweetheart? 
[03:29:30]  That means it, Tom.  This is Janine.  Janine?  Yeah.  She lost 100, and how many pounds?  65-ish.  165 pounds she lost.  Good for you.  I was like, you know, I like to lose 15.  Whoa, there you go.  The first five's the hardest, Anthony.  Get a stop at the cookies.  And now she makes balloon animals.  This is our big grand finale for the J.M.  That's how she learned.  You have a lot of loose skin, you can make balloon animals, like, with your belly?  Yeah, so it looks like a bees without the air.  What were you gonna say?  She actually twisted her stomach into an animal, so it didn't hold as much food. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, guys.  Oh, stop.  That's impossible.  I know that.  The things that comics will do with each other on the road are far gayer than actual gayness.  Would you agree to that?  Um, yeah.  I'm not saying, like, you're sucking anyone off.  Okay.  Sucked by Kelly's cock?  You don't agree?  I don't know.  What do comics do?  The only one that's ever done anything was you.  I sat down and you showed me a picture of your cock, like, look at all that.  And I looked at it.  To what?  Like, to, like, suburbia that's, like, gay. 
[03:30:30]  Is it?  You take a picture of your cock and show it to another man, and we enjoy it.  Why?  It's not like I rubbed it on your face.  Jimmy is actually...  I'm waiting.  Jimmy's actually bent over and spread his ass cheeks.  And he's fucking high.  And then stands there, so when I open the stall when I'm leaving...  Yeah, and he's fucking highbrowing me the whole story now.  Right there.  No, I'm not, no, no.  I actually...  You're like, no, I don't know what you're talking about.  I mean, when Anthony does it, it's different.  You know, I'll let Anthony sit inside of my fucking stomach through the back.  You just fucking highbrow on me, boy.  It's hairless.  I'm going to say it's not gay, though.  The selfie with a picture of your dick is fine. 
[03:31:00]  It's healthy.  I'll say to...  I'll be on the road.  I'll say to the opening act, come to my room right now.  I can't even explain it.  You did that to me.  What's she making besides a headache?  Oh, Miami.  Oh, no.  Fort Lauderdale.  I go, Jimmy, come to my room right away.  And I'm on the bed on all fours, and my asshole's spread open wide open.  And he goes, oh, God.  And he goes back to the room.  And you say that to somebody, and they go...  That's hilarious.  Well, you guys are gay.  Yeah.  And I'm like, no, I'm not gay.  They go, well, you just sat in the room with your asshole pointing at the door when a guy  walked in so he could have sex with you.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but it's funny. 
[03:31:30]  It was funny.  Because you're comedians.  It's hysterical funny.  If you were sales guys, then, yeah, very gay.  Sales guys, that's hot.  You know what Bert does on the road?  What?  He'll take a shit in the toilet and not flush, and he'll shave and leave all his whiskers in,  and then he'll piss on the floor and put the TV on Telemundo and leave.  Oh, my God.  The housekeepers are like, what's wrong with these people?  Jay, you know what?  It's out of the window.  You deserve a plug for that.  Hold on a minute.  No, wait.  What the fuck is it going to be?  Jimmy has a princess. 
[03:32:00]  That is fucking hysterical.  Where'd you go?  Oh, wow, look.  Bert's funny.  Very funny, man.  That's hilarious.  She has a bubble in the middle of the show.  So how are you a friend of the show here, Janine?  Janine...  What is her leg?  She's got fucking cripple legs.  But they don't use me anymore.  She was the hole.  Yeah.  Oh, guys.  It's a hole gown.  Wow, look at that princess balloon thing.  That's Cinderella.  Boo!  What is this?  Boo!  Boo!  That's a gown.  A gown?  Boo!  It's a balloon gown.  Boo!  I had to implement it.  Bumish!  Filth!  Slime!  Queen of slime! 
[03:32:30]  It's actually good.  Is that from Have Fun Storming the Castle?  I don't have that one.  She has nice hands.  You like your little blown-out?  What is it?  It's Cinderella.  I was at Disneyland with my son.  You meet all the princesses.  They're all lined up.  And they go, here's Ariel.  She's not a princess.  You know, whatever.  It's for Ariel.  And here's the other.  What are some other princesses' names?  Fuck that cock!  Uh, who?  Name some other princesses.  He's still in Ottawa and George.  Jasmine.  Snow White.  Snow White. 
[03:33:00]  And at the very end of the line was Cinderella.  Thanks, I'm real.  This is fun.  And I met Cinderella, and I swear to God, she froze me.  Like, I looked at Cinderella, and I went,  Is she pretty?  Really hot?  It's fucking Cinderella.  Yeah.  And like, she's in, when she's in the park, she's Cinderella.  And the other princesses, I'm like, who gives a shit?  Like, yeah, yeah, Beauty and the Beast, fucking Poison Apple,  have sex with midgets, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  He's got daddy issues.  And then at the end, I got to Cinderella,  and the lady shook my hand and did like a super fancy, like, curtsy, 
[03:33:30]  and I was speechless, like,  How does it feel to know that she has a fucking barbed wire tattoo on her arm,  and she probably took a roid shit that morning,  and her fucking boyfriend gave her fucking HPV?  What's that?  It's fucking genital warts.  Papalona.  Yeah.  The human papalona.  Running of the bulls and papalona virus.  The inside of her box looks like a fucking Lincoln Tunnel with grapes on it.  And there's an actual line.  It's running of the bulls in your vagina.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:34:00]  How about when they have those commercials for, like, Cialis,  and they go,  This does not protect against HIV or AIDS.  Yeah.  It actually helps you get it.  Now you tell me.  Yes.  I got to tell you that.  Yeah.  Keeps your dick hard.  How would it protect?  If your dick is harder, it means you fuck longer.  Are we going to try to do the 911 audio?  All right.  Where's my plug you said I earned?  Yeah, you did.  I didn't have it in front of me,  but that line was too brilliant.  April 8th, Red Bank, Count Basie Theater.  Jay Moore is back doing his comedy.  He retired for a while.  But now I'm very funny. 
[03:34:30]  You're very funny.  April 9th, Morristown, New Jersey, Community Theater.  I mean, you should do some gigs.  How about that?  We could do big rooms.  Why not?  Let's do some gigs with Jay.  Big rooms.  Rumor has it, Jim Norton's going to be at the Red Bank,  New Jersey, Count Basie Theater.  No.  Just a rumor.  No, no, not true at all.  We've got to start rumors.  Oh, I think we're performing.  No, I'll be in Morristown in September performing that theater.  No, no, you might be in Morristown April 9th when Jay's there,  just because you might be in the area.  Oh, yeah, circulating, meeting some fans, shaking hands. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  There you go.  I'm going to stop.  All right, 911 audio.  What's the story?  Anthony, you heard this on the way in.  Yeah, I heard this on the way in on Tent of the Wounds, the news station.  Apparently, this woman was a little miffed at her hubby.  Might have been running out on her or something.  Whatever the circumstance, she was mad.  She handcuffed her husband to, I believe, herself.  Yeah.  And then started beating on him. 
[03:35:30]  And biting him.  And biting him and just basically abusing him.  And he is the biggest pussy ever.  He's got a high-pitched little whiny voice.  That's right.  And he should have taken the phone and just smashed her over the head with it  instead of calling 911.  Because they can't even believe it.  Why are you near a microphone?  Because you can't hear her making balloon animals unless she's near one.  Is this good for your business to do it on the mic when people are talking? 
[03:36:00]  She can't help herself.  She has to make balloon animals.  What is your real business?  I'm a makeup artist.  You're a makeup artist?  Yeah.  We'll make up a way to do balloon animals over there.  Like, come on, guys.  It was too easy.  Another way of canned laughter is what Voss is used to when he's playing fishing boats.  Voss isn't a boat act.  He's a glass-bottom boat act.  Sometimes the wheels don't show.  Voss has to do time.  All right.  Here's the actual 911 call. 
[03:36:30]  The guy's chained to either his wife still or somewhere.  Yeah.  My wife has handcuffed me.  I need assistance right away.  What happened?  He's Jewish.  My wife has handcuffed me.  Asian.  Sounds like David.  Yeah, she's handcuffed me.  She's handcuffed.  She's handcuffed me.  She's attacking me.  I have not done anything to her.  She has a record of violence.  Please come and help me get out of here.  Okay.  Where is she now? 
[03:37:00]  I'm holding her down so I can call you.  Please send someone.  Is there any way that you can lock yourself in another room?  No.  She's handcuffed herself to me.  Please send someone.  Okay.  Is she hurting you, sir?  Do you need an ambulance?  Yes.  No.  Sue everyone.  I need police.  Okay, sir.  You know what you do?  Just go, uh, boom.  Uh, boom. 
[03:37:30]  Goosh.  Come on.  Honeymoon is here.  You're going to love it.  All right, Norton.  Get up.  Get up in the hammock, Norton.  What are you making now?  You're driving me out of the studio.  I'm going to go back and take another...  Is it the balloons?  I'm so sorry.  I don't understand what's happening.  We're just fucking around.  Oh, that's okay.  It's me and Ray Liotta.  Remember when you guys had poker chips and everybody was like, stop with the poker chips?  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  But that took months to seep into my head.  That's when I was here every day because I lived around the corner.  Yeah, yeah.  But this, I just sat down.  I'm like, okay, with that now. 
[03:38:00]  You missed her coming in.  Why don't you just make a snake?  I was talking to her.  Oh, I apologize.  You were taking a dump.  I was taking a wet dump.  You were actually...  It looked like when she blows the balloons up, it looked like a brown balloon coming out  of Jay's ass.  Let me see you do a nice, sexy balloon blow.  She can't blow them up.  No, she uses a little pump.  A balloon pump.  Oh, wow.  What did you just do?  Just deep through.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  I apologize.  Have you ever seen...  You're not at a kid's party there, honey.  Have you ever seen the guy on SNL, Fred Armisen, do Governor David Patterson? 
[03:38:30]  Yes, of course.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He does it as an old Jewish comic.  Of course, at least I don't live in Jersey.  But the way he does his stupid eyes.  Stupid eyes.  He goes, let's be honest.  I was never going to get those pig farmers to vote for me to begin with.  He's caught some flack for doing that.  Has he?  Because the governor, yeah, the governor doesn't like...  You know how he got on SNL is he sent in, like, movies he made with his friends. 
[03:39:00]  Really?  He never did stand-up in his life.  And that was this.  Jesus.  And they said, bring him in.  Have him washed and sent to my town.  More audio.  Are there any weapons in the house?  Um, I don't know.  Knives and such.  I don't know what she got before she handcuffed me.  There could be no...  Ow!  Ow!  What is she doing now, sir?  Yeah!  She's taking her head out!  She's bothering me!  Are they almost here? 
[03:39:30]  I can't get to the door to open it.  Okay, is it locked?  The door's locked.  Okay, so they're going to have to break in?  Yeah.  Motherfuck you!  Motherfuck you!  Why does she do this?  You browse all day, no pie!  I'm going to work good.  I'm going to start to leave here.  And...  Ow!  Motherfuck you! 
[03:40:00]  Wow.  She's like one of those chimps ripping his face off.  What are you doing now?  Make your butt in your arm!  Will you punch that bitch in the face?  Just fucking slug her at that point.  Be a man.  You know, you don't hit a woman, but if you're handcuffed to her and she's biting you, you've  got to knock a bitch out.  The old bits are off.  The good ones don't mind a good slap.  Oh, yeah?  Guys, Janine might be done with her balloon at them.  The old 1950s shatter. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  A little good love-making slap.  Ah, shut up.  I was watching...  Give me one of those.  I'm on the program guide last night, and on TMC it said Cocaine Cowboys, that documentary.  I put it out.  It's about Chuck Jones.  It was...  Get the fuck out of here, man.  No, it was supposed to be Cocaine Cowboys, but I'm sitting there for like a half hour,  baked out of my face, going, how does this guy tie into the drug cartel?  I'm like, oh, I bet he did so much coke that he started drawing Bugs Bunny. 
[03:41:00]  And then my wife's like, what are you watching?  I go, uh, Cocaine Cowboys.  And she goes, you know, we watched that already.  This is not it.  I go, oh.  And then I watched the octuplets.  Oh, yeah.  Octomob.  Look at her little nubs.  It's like when someone doesn't have a hand and those are their fingers.  It's like the midget hand.  Oh, yeah, like that deformed kind of thalidomide baby thing going.  Well, it's easy to make fun, but...  That's why we do it.  Gank to the neck and the hat of the geese.  Janine, are you almost done with your balloon?  I am.  I'm leaving soon.  Are you really embarrassed? 
[03:41:30]  I'm dying.  Why are you embarrassed?  You lost 150 pounds.  Be happy.  Because she's dying over here.  Be proud of yourself.  I love a big girl.  Dean Edwards is afraid to come on the show and go head to head and do all my black comedian  voices.  I had another black person I thought of, and I forget who it was now.  Oh, well.  All right, think while we play the last bit of audio here.  There's more.  Is there any way that you can put something so she can't bite you?  No.  I'm just trying to use every hand to keep her away from me. 
[03:42:00]  No pillow?  No pillow.  I made it hard.  They've been on the way since you first gave me the address.  I'm just trying to keep you on the phone to make sure that everything's okay.  Does she have any knives or anything that she can grab or anything?  I don't know what she has.  8.33.  I know, sir.  I already have the address.  They've been on the way for a couple minutes now.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm so sorry.  I just... 
[03:42:30]  She just came out of nowhere and handcuffed you?  Yeah, that's when I woke up.  Okay.  You're on the first floor.  Knock my teeth out.  Oh, yeah.  You got it.  And, yeah, the phone went dead, obviously, so...  He was an Asian guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.  An Asian couple.  And she's just a crazy broad that likes to tie him up and, uh... 
[03:43:00]  And she just...  When he was sleeping, she handcuffed him and just bit him?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, he was sleeping.  She handcuffed him.  Started biting him.  Fucking back up!  Back the fuck up on the mic!  It fucking bothers me!  It's giving me chills!  Spider-Man.  Look at Spider-Man.  I have to get out of here.  Are there any fucking four-year-olds in here?  Oh, wow.  What the fuck is going on?  Red Bay Theater, April 8th.  That's what's going on, bitches.  Look, he's leaping!  Yes.  Yes, look. 
[03:43:30]  What do you think of Spider-Man?  What happened to you guys?  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Out of here, Jim!  This is catchphrase, ladies and gentlemen.  Catchphrase, ladies and gentlemen.  I've never seen Jimsy in person.  Oh, Jimsy does the face in everything.  Yeah, we don't know if...  Oh, it's an amazing story today.  What do you think the problem was with this Asian man once they got him uncuffed?  He had a subdural hematoma!  He was an Asian man like Sam.  His wife should be moved. 
[03:44:00]  Wow!  I never saw the face.  It's great.  He does the hand and everything.  She had the equivalent of a small person cut out of her stomach!  Come in my mouth, host the Jimsy!  I do have a very flat ass.  Are you all flippity and floppity now?  Very much so.  Flippity and floppity!  I don't know.  What do you want me to say?  Are you flippity and floppity?  Are you gross?  Pretty gross.  No, you're a nice girl.  No, look at her.  She's beautiful.  Can they tighten that up and fix it?  They can eventually.  It just takes a lot of money.  They just tie a knot in your back.  How did you lose all the weight? 
[03:44:30]  Stop eating.  Surgery.  You're like a nut.  Are we going to do a fundraiser for you to get this done?  How come you lost weight?  Well...  Wow.  I almost said something.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, not against you.  Okay.  I was going to mention people we know that have had surgery that haven't lost any weight.  Who?  It's people we know.  Who?  Can you write it down?  No.  What's it rhyme with?  I won't.  Because it'll get back to me in two seconds.  Oh, I know.  Yes.  No. 
[03:45:00]  March, April.  No, I may know, but I'm not sure.  Oh, no.  I'm not talking about that.  It's the addictive.  I just want to make sure, because that's what's going to end up happening to you.  Oh, look.  Oh, I'm a Spider-Man.  Can I see it?  He's calling it for you.  Yeah.  Look, I'm jumping.  Oh.  Wow.  Jim, you're good.  Whoa.  Jim's playing with fucking balloon animals.  I improv.  Oh, look.  I'm some Spider-Man.  You improv.  Like Steve, you improv.  He can bring you to party.  Yes.  I'm gay, and I can't produce things.  Oh, shit. 
[03:45:30]  I will say this.  Steve is pretty on top of it.  What?  What?  I mean, as far as like...  That's not the guy.  Good one, Danny.  As far as producing, you know, it's just weird when you're on your contact info for your  press blitz.  Just contact Steve Carlessi, 908.  You're like, what?  That's the show.  Oh, yeah.  That's that guy.  I like Steve.  Is he gay for real?  No.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  My parents live near Foundry Street. 
[03:46:00]  Foundry Street.  Oh.  In New Jersey.  Nice.  Really?  Is it hard to get through and navigate to?  Oh, my gosh.  Can I just watch a clip without that dumb mask on fire in the corner?  Oh, Christ.  Enough already, right?  All right.  Janine's packing up her animals.  Let's see.  Thank you.  You just came in to do that?  Yeah, Janine.  I'm going to shoot webs at you.  Whoa.  I'm good.  This is fun.  Wow.  Let's do some improv, Janine.  I'm really...  Okay.  Go ahead.  You start.  I got nothing.  I really...  I'm Steve.  That was good. 
[03:46:30]  Did a good Steve impression.  Where else do you get Ray Liotta and Balloon Animals, Jake?  I'm putting this on my resume.  That is true.  She appeared with Jay Moore and Ray Liotta.  You drew that Spider-Man face.  I could tell you're kind of artistic.  You didn't draw that, did you?  I thought she was autistic.  Came out of Jenny McCarthy.  Oh, shit.  How long is she going to gravy train that one kid?  She got three books on one kid.  It's caused by me.  It caused...  What happened?  Quiet.  She lost Jim on that one. 
[03:47:00]  Why?  I kind of agree with you.  She wrote a book about her son's autism.  I'll never be famous.  And the next book is about her son's autism, but it's like about how she saved her son's  life through a diet high in carrots.  Really?  When you look up Jenny McCarthy...  When do you hear the name of this book?  Do you think Jim Carrey really likes the kid?  Or is he playing it up to?  I don't know, but when did Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy start looking exactly alike?  How about Fergie and Bret Michaels?  I got to look at pictures of that. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, you know what?  Go on RonFez.net.  You go look alike celebrities.  Okay.  And there's like a montage of like 20 actresses.  Yeah.  You don't know who the hell is who after a minute.  Look, this is Anthony getting somebody off his property.  You mother...  Car smashed into two guys fighting on the street.  The one guy bounced right up.  The one guy I didn't even care because he was in the right.  Yeah.  Wow, this is shocking videos they're showing, I guess, on Maury. 
[03:48:00]  I'm going on Maury.  I'm going to make my boobs look big.  Shocking wombs.  What's the name of the book there, Hanson?  Well, there's a few of them.  You got Louder Than Words, A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism.  All right.  All right.  So she's healing autism.  Yeah.  How is Jenny McCarthy, the naked girl on Santa's lap, healing autism?  What's it going on?  I got another one.  Good burn.  There's another one called...  Hold on a second.  Who's the publisher?  Moore makes a good point.  Moore's. 
[03:48:30]  Moore's makes a good point.  I'll tell you.  Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's.  Jay Moore's makes a good point.  Who's the publisher?  If the internet ever works, I'll tell you.  It never works the internet.  It's always letting me down.  Every time you try to do something, you really have to, it just doesn't work.  That's being incredibly sarcastic.  No, I wasn't.  You're Plumans?  Plumans?  I'm being literal Anthony.  What?  Plume?  P-L-U-M-E.  Nobody me and Jimmy write for it.  Go ahead.  Let's kill it.  I wanted to make sure.  You're a smart man.  It's not Hyperion.  We shit on stuff and then realize they're major sponsors and things like that. 
[03:49:00]  Not me, Anthony.  I'm a company man.  You're smart.  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  Not dumb.  People think.  That's the best line.  Not dumb like everyone says.  Yeah, like everyone knows.  Fucking overrated movie.  Fucking overrated movie.  No, it's not.  Godfather?  Godfather's not.  It's lit like a fucking student film.  I can't see anybody.  I can't see, goddammit.  It's not overrated.  What about we're in the boathouse?  You can't see anyone.  It's black.  That's the point.  The DP wanted to cloud it. 
[03:49:30]  No, he fucking blew it.  Two men are talking and I see a fucking lake behind them.  It's still a great movie, though.  It's a good movie.  Godfather 2 is great.  Yeah, 2 is an awesome movie.  There's no boathouse in Godfather 1, silly.  Oh, shut up.  I don't know.  There's no boathouse in number 1.  Who cares?  Number 2.  There didn't have a boathouse.  There were no boats in number 1.  2, there was the boathouse.  Of course there was.  When he lowers it down.  They didn't have boats in part 1.  No.  You want to talk to him?  You talk to him.  He'll kill me.  What's the other movie called?  I mean, what's the other book called? 
[03:50:00]  Well, you got Mother Warriors, A Nation of Parents Healing Autism Against All Odds.  Am I the only one that finds this fucking repulsive?  What are you guys, fucking soft now?  No.  No.  I'm tweeting.  I don't know what you're talking about.  What's the other one called?  It gets better.  What do you mean it gets better?  How many books?  She's got one kid with autism.  She's got 19 books about healing a kid with autism.  Either heal the fucking kid or stop writing. 
[03:50:30]  She wrote books with my fucking father.  We take a commercial break.  We'll be right back into this.  It seems those are the only two autism books.  Then she has Belly Laughs, The Naked Truth About Pregnancy and Childbirth.  All right, enough.  How about you write a book about being a fucking...  The Naked Truth About the First Year of Mommyhood.  Jesus.  Ugh.  It used to be funny, right?  Yeah, something.  Why did she always just go...  There we go.  That chick's kind of hot and she's taking her tongue out.  I was never a fan of her comedically.  I always thought she was just...  She was going by the thing like, 
[03:51:00]  Aren't I a pretty girl?  Act like a boy.  What about her picture on the toilet with her panties down?  I didn't say I wouldn't jerk off to her,  but I just didn't find her amusing.  When did Kathy Griffin turn into Liberace?  Have you seen her lately?  No.  Oh my God.  She's like an actually cellophane mess.  Okay, pull up the picture of Kathy.  You don't think she's funny, right?  No, you know what?  He's very funny.  There was like two years...  I just don't like her, man.  Here's the thing.  When I quit comedy is because I was doing like bits  and I hated what I was doing.  Right.  And it was like I, as a guy, changed, 
[03:51:30]  but I was going up on stage with the same old shit  and I was like, what am I doing?  And then I was watching like Kathy Griffin  and she...  I agree with Jimmy.  Like I watched her tell stories that happened to her  and I thought they were pretty funny.  Not like hilarious, but they were pretty funny  and I thought that's where comedy for me,  that's where comedy has to go.  You can't go up on...  And I think as comedy as a whole,  I think that's where it has to go.  I don't think people want to spend $40 for a ticket  and have you go like,  you know, I was in Paducah, Kentucky  and the plane had a string attached to it  because it's one of those...  Like people are like,  they've seen every fucking bit in the world. 
[03:52:00]  It's got to be about you.  But if you go up and go,  I took my son to Medieval Times  and I think maybe he's gay,  like then they're going to...  It's a whole thing.  It's like a story about you.  That's where comedy...  So I will say Kathy Griffin motivated me in a way.  I went, that's where comedy has to go as a whole.  I hate like bits.  Don't call her a whole then.  I hate bits.  I hate going up and going,  you ever fly Southwest Airlines?  No, never.  But I bet you got something to say about it  because you keep looking at your fucking notes on the stool.  God forbid you remember four new jokes. 
[03:52:30]  Fucking that whole notebook crowd.  Oh, where they're just too cool for the room.  I try things out every night.  You know what I do?  I go, I only have four things to try out.  But if you can go on stage  and perform for an hour  with the shit that you have memorized  and go, oh yeah.  But Jay, that's...  I want to talk about when my dog walks in on me  when I'm taking a shit  and just looks at me  and I feel weird.  Know why that's lame.  It's their safety net  in case the bit doesn't work that well.  But none of the bits work.  I know, but then they're like,  well, I was just trying it out anyway. 
[03:53:00]  I got it on a notepad.  Janine Garofalo, Richard Lewis.  Lewis does the notepad.  Richard Lewis has had that for 30 years though.  It's like a weird security blanket thing.  He's got a piano on stage.  None of it's funny.  It's always like,  look at the Jew on the piano.  Nay, give me a topic.  I was never a fan.  I'll do the Seinfeld game.  I'll do it with Richard Lewis.  I was never a fan of Richard Lewis.  Give me a topic.  Running quickly with an AIDS needle.  I don't jog.  I don't jog.  Everyone will go,  look at the Jew running.  It's a Jew and he's on the run. 
[03:53:30]  Oh God, that Richard Lewis.  It's crazy.  Give me a topic.  I want to play two.  All right.  The guy that always tries to one-up people.  Give me one.  I'll do it.  He's crying.  Look, he's laughing.  He's cracking up.  Making mud pies as a child.  When I was a kid,  I would make mud pies  and throw them at people  and everybody would have mud on their faces.  He's laughing.  See?  Boo!  Then there would be a murder.  Boo!  Boo!  He got mud in his veins, Sam. 
[03:54:00]  I wish people could see this face.  I know.  It's amazing.  Your hair, dude,  looks like a mud pie, Sam.  It's like you see the real people.  I have a little curdle of corn teeth.  My girlfriend on the boat  has an ass like a mud pie, Sam.  Oh, it's all flat.  It's very flat.  Remember the one year  he had a horse in the Kentucky Derby?  Oh, yeah.  Jackie's girl or something?  Jackie's Klugman.  That's right.  And my whole family,  for some reason,  was sitting on the TV  watching the Kentucky Derby 
[03:54:30]  and we were all rooting  for Jack Klugman's stupid horse.  Why?  Who gives a shit?  I don't know,  but to me and my family,  it was Oscar Madison's dog.  Very important.  Yeah.  Dog.  The name of my horse  is Throat Cancer.  Throat Cancer.  Oh, God.  Anywhere out of this stretch  they come.  Throat Cancer.  Pneumatic tire is flat.  Pneumatic tire is flat.  I don't remember that one.  We lost a girl.  She was skiing without a help. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, good girl.  Next time you hit your head,  aren't you going to be freaked out  that you have a fucking  hypothyroid.  Stuck in a headache?  Go right to the fucking hospital.  Subdural hematoma, yeah.  Hey, Jay Moores.  Did you see the latest picture  of Jennifer Aniston?  So, is she pregnant or not?  These magazines...  I was starting to say  that she's pregnant.  All the magazines go,  baby news,  her and John are thrilled.  It's like,  why don't you sue them for...  They broke up.  I know.  I think he...  And she's wearing a...  She looks like a Jawa.  Yeah, she's wearing a giant hood.  She looks cool like that. 
[03:55:30]  Do you know,  if they wanted to fucking  block the paparazzi,  just hire four guys  to surround you  with big black,  like, cardboard things?  That's what Tom Cruise does.  Does he?  Actually, on Jerry Maguire,  they...  Yeah, it's a movie I made.  Yeah, I know.  It was a good one.  They were on the rooftops  across the streets  and people,  wherever Tom went,  followed around  with those giant flags,  those silk flags.  Covered them up?  Yeah, it's like a...  But I was like,  who cares if they get a picture  of him standing here?  I like Michael Jackson's technique  where he just puts fucking...  Wraps his kids up in plastic bags.  Plastic bags.  Fucking dry cleaning bag 
[03:56:00]  over his kid's head.  I don't know what he's doing.  Jerk.  I saw a picture  of this fucking thing.  I don't know what it was  over his kid's head.  He's a shower cap.  That's what it looked like,  a shower cap  over the kid's head.  It's like what ODB used to wear.  Yeah, the kids fucking  dressed like the guy  in the wheelchair  in Boys in the Hood.  Yes.  Thank you.  Jesus.  Nice.  I saw that in a black theater.  Really?  Oh.  The white devil.  My friend called me  and said he saw Watchmen.  I see it.  He said it was so terrible.  He was thrilled 
[03:56:30]  there was black people  in the theater.  Did they like it?  No, they hated it,  but they were like,  oh, you gotta be kidding.  They were actually  yelling white stuff like,  you have got to be kidding me.  They weren't like,  oh, that's your ass now.  You got the pistol  when you went in the window.  They were like,  oh, you have got  to be kidding me.  You really should have been here  when I dressed Patrice down.  Why did you dress him down?  Because he was just fucking  starting his shit.  And I was telling him  how black comics stink  because all they do  is impersonate white guys 
[03:57:00]  how goofy they all are.  And he's like,  no, they don't.  I was like,  yes, they do.  And then he told me  that Dean Edwards  did better impressions than me  and I went crazy.  No, well,  we don't know that yet.  We got to have  the big showdown.  No, we know that he said it.  He said,  he said,  you can't do,  he said,  I don't know where he goes.  I bet you can't do  Tracy Morgan.  But I said,  we have to have  the big showdown.  Pacino's in the room.  I was sticking up  for Jay Morris.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Pacino.  What time is it there?  We're slowly wrapping up 
[03:57:30]  just because Danny's  going to cut a lot of this  out of the replay.  Can you do Pacino?  Do Pacino.  Oh, I agree, Jimmy.  Which Pacino?  You want young or old?  That's great.  Wow.  Maybe I'm thick.  Maybe I don't get it  when you tell me that.  Why don't you explain it  to me so I understand?  What were you thinking,  you fucking cunt?  What are you doing  in Red Bank?  But of course,  young Pacino  is like this.  Well, Vietnam veterans  killing don't mean  nothing to us. 
[03:58:00]  I sound like Tyne Daly.  Why, Leon,  when everything  was going so well?  Jesus, that's good.  I can't think of  young Pacino now.  Don't ask me  about my business,  Kay.  Why are you taking  on Frank Caliando  in a cage match  with the impressions?  I fucking,  I want to take  on anybody.  I'm taking on  all comers.  Let's get that done.  UFC style.  You and Frank  do the impressions.  What impression  does he do  that I don't?  Madden?  Yeah.  George W.  George W. 
[03:58:30]  He's got a great  question.  He's got good  name and number.  So, if you leave  your name and number,  I'll get back to you.  Thank you.  It's Al.  That's Al Pacino's  answering machine.  You just dialed up  Al Pacino's  answering machine.  You leave your name  and number.  I hope you turn the phone off.  Can I see your phone off?  He wouldn't care.  He's my buddy.  You know Pacino?  Go to his house.  Get the fuck out of here.  You've known this.  No, I haven't.  Our kids play together.  Yeah!  He's got twins. 
[03:59:00]  I want a picture with him.  Can I go over?  I'll bring a kid.  I'll just kidnap one  and bring it.  I want to talk to you  about your friend Jimmy.  What happened to your friend?  What do you talk to him about?  Salome.  Oscar Wilde plays.  He's very upset  that he lives in L.A.  because he's got custody  of the kids  or he had to fight  for seeing the Yorker?  Son of a bitch.  You are a good actor,  you little fucking prick.  You fucking prick. 
[03:59:30]  I want to go to Al's house.  He lives on Beverly,  like in Beverly Hills.  He goes,  I got to tell you,  I'm having a hard time  adjusting, Jay.  I mean, here we are  with two men  and we're out on the porch  watching cars go by  driven by who knows.  I mean, hello.  I'm from the 70s.  They wrote books about us.  We were kind of important.  I was like, wow.  When you put it like that,  you were fucking,  you were the guys.  There's like four guys  that were it. 
[04:00:00]  Him?  Him.  De Niro?  You know, I was watching  that thing.  Nicholson?  De Niro and him  in that Righteous Kill movie.  I got to tell you,  it's not a good movie,  obviously.  I could have made  a better movie  with a mirror  and my home video camera.  But here's the thing.  Starring as two of us.  It was fucking horrendous.  And I'll tell Al that.  That fucking  continued success.  Worst death scene ever.  Mark Maron  had an interesting point  on your show  that they don't act anymore. 
[04:00:30]  They just put together  a series of ticks  that they've acquired  over the years.  And that's De Niro.  But I will say this.  I will stand staunchly  in Pacino's corner  that he is,  no,  not because I'm friends  with him.  He is looking for it  in a shitty movie.  You could tell  he put in,  like he's trying,  De Niro's walking around  like there's a scene  of De Niro  fucking bench pressing.  And you know he's doing  like their fucking fake weights  because like what is he  fucking benching?  He's on fucking Soho  putting up fucking linguine.  Bench his shitty resume. 
[04:01:00]  Rocking Bullwinkle DVD.  It was like Pacino's a guy  like every time  he goes into a movie  like,  I mean you watch Insomnia.  That was not long ago.  He was fucking amazing  in Insomnia.  Like I was tired  watching this guy.  Yeah,  he was great.  Yeah,  yeah,  that was pretty good.  Why don't we go down  to the schoolyard?  Pull him,  I totally blew that impression.  Why don't we go down  to the schoolyard?  We'll pull him out of school,  shake him up.  It's 10 o'clock.  I know.  In the morning.  Oh,  why don't you tell me that? 
[04:01:30]  I would slept in six days.  And Robin Williams goes,  I'm not who you think I am.  I think you're a piece of shit.  Guys like you and my job.  You think you're different  because you cut a fucking nail.  Come on.  That's a great movie, man.  I think it was my first  Robin Williams try, too.  You gotta get through  a lot of armor,  but he used to do  vaudeville with his brothers.  Well,  he used to do a lot  of sketch comedy.  A lot of armor,  what do you mean? 
[04:02:00]  They used to go to like,  they grew up in like  a tenement house here  in back,  he's older.  Yeah.  And they used to go to like  shows,  and they would put on shows.  They put on shows.  Him and his brother goes,  we had this one sketch  where like,  you know when you go  to the shooting gallery  on Coney Island,  and you shoot the target,  and it goes bing,  and you know that you hit it,  you win a prize.  And it's always like  a big bear stuffed  in the corner.  You gotta shoot the bear,  and the bear moves around.  My brother keeps 
[04:02:30]  shooting his pistol,  and he hits the bear  four or five times.  And then my other brother  keeps shooting the bear.  That mixed old and new  Pacino there.  And then the bear  follows us home.  And he knocks on the door  because we've enraged  the bear  because we wouldn't  stop shooting him  at the shooting.  It was a crack up.  But it's like actually  a pretty funny sketch.  Like you just keep  shooting the bear  in the shooting gallery,  and the bear just walks  out of the shooting gallery  and follows down the boardwalk.  Like enough!  With the fucking shooting man. 
[04:03:00]  And he's telling me this.  I'm like, oh my god.  Do you have a photo with him?  No.  Why?  I do.  It's called a movie.  There's lots of photos  put together in a movie.  Simone.  Is that new?  No.  That was the one  with the virtual reality model.  That was the summer.  Alright, I'm gonna sit you down.  I'm your agent.  Alright, you're gonna do  two movies this summer.  One's with Eddie Murphy.  All your scenes  are with Eddie Murphy.  And the other one  is with Al Pacino.  All your scenes  are with Al Pacino.  And you have two scenes  with Winona Ryder.  You in? 
[04:03:30]  It's Simone and Pluto Nash.  Wow.  Okay.  Wait!  What do you mean  you don't care?  You think you fucking  hit the big time finally.  I mean,  I thought they were a bad movie.  I would do them.  You would do them  not realizing  they were gonna be  the actual two worst films  of these people's careers.  Yeah.  And then I was  the common denominator.  But it's like,  oh.  Oh.  I got that going for me.  That's why I went  right to television.  I love TV.  No one cuts you out  when you're Gary. 
[04:04:00]  You're on the Ghost Whisperer  running around  with a flashlight  chasing her cleavage  going,  is it spooky?  And then you get  to be Gary.  Gary Unmarried.  Is she, uh...  It's all tonight.  She's very nice.  No, what's her face there?  Jennifer Love Hewitt?  Yeah.  Super nice.  Really?  Extraordinarily.  Kind person.  Beautiful too, huh?  Interesting.  Yeah, and when she comes in  with no makeup on,  really pretty.  Really, really, really,  really pretty.  I used to have a thing for her.  Who, Ant did?  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know,  when she was like 15. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah?  Oh, really?  Beautiful girl.  With no makeup on?  That's Acqua Seponi,  they say in Italian, right?  Soap and water beautiful.  Soap and water beautiful.  You don't know that?  You fucking whop.  The kind of Guinea Maya.  I don't know that.  Soap and water beautiful.  That's funny.  I'm trying to think about...  You know,  I was listening to a replay  and when I did...  There was some impression  I wanted to do on you guys  and I totally forget what it was.  It was a brand new one too.  I love hearing the new ones.  Everybody from the Food Network. 
[04:05:00]  Yeah, well...  Who the fuck watches?  A lot of...  I know.  Believe me,  we had a discussion  about the stupid cake show  the other day.  The Barefoot Contessa.  The fucking...  What's the name  of that stupid thing?  Ace of Cakes  when the guy's got  that twat hair on his chin.  The guy's got twat hair  on his face.  He's got twat hair.  I saw a picture  on the other day, yeah.  Oh, so I'm talking to Patrice  about impressions.  He goes,  I bet you can't do  Tracy Morgan  as good as Dean Edwards  and I do my whole  Tracy spiel  and he goes, 
[04:05:30]  do Denzel Washington.  Like,  I'm not black.  Like,  can't you take  the Forrest Whitaker,  Chris Tucker  and Tracy Morgan  and go,  check.  Yeah.  Instead of going like,  can't do Denzel though.  You got me, Patrice.  When the black comic  will only go,  no,  ho, ho,  when you do the white guy.  Hey,  I'm doing my lawn.  Patrice comes in  dressed as fucking  Clyde Frazier.  That was an amazing outfit  that day.  It's his new look,  you know.  He's changing his...  Ever see a white motherfucker  cross the street 
[04:06:00]  when a brother  come to your white man?  White man just go,  look out baggy,  here come the niggers  cross the street,  here we go.  It's true.  It's fucking appalling  and I'm sick of it.  That's why I go on stage  and make fun of black people.  We're going to be on stage,  Jay.  We got to wrap up.  I am going to be...  Because we're going to cut  the shit out of this,  unfortunately.  Why?  Well,  we went over time.  That's all.  What time do you guys get out of here?  That's why people have to  listen to the show live  because we end up  cutting every day.  We got no commercials.  Yeah.  Who said that?  Me.  I just yawned.  I yawned.  I said commercials.  I thought Spidey's  were my characters. 
[04:06:30]  April 8th,  Red Bank, New Jersey.  April 8th,  Red Bank, New Jersey,  Cal Basie Theater.  And then the 9th,  Moorristown, New Jersey  Community Theater.  Right.  Let's sell some tickets  out there.  Well,  you're going to take on  all impressionists  out there  and you're going to tell  some stories on stage  like Kathy Griffin.  CSI Miami.  Better than Kathy Griffin.  Well,  Frank,  stories,  that's what happens  when the driven  get taken for a ride.  Oh,  is he the worst?  That show's amazing.  But they all start  acting like him. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  Well,  Frank,  and then he takes  his glove.  Well,  Frank.  Exit,  stage left even.  But fucking Frank's  in every open.  Yeah.  Well,  Frank.  Janine,  thanks for the  balloon animals.  Oh,  yeah,  we couldn't have  been there.  They were a hit.  Yeah.  Jimmy,  where are you performing?  Poughkeepsie's coming up.  I got bananas,  Poughkeepsie coming up.  Is it this Friday?  Next Friday.  What day,  Jim?  Week from Friday.  Well,  Jay worked too.  I don't know.  Week from Friday.  So it's Friday.  Big room,  400 seats,  Poughkeepsie bananas.  Oh,  yes,  I'm only doing Friday.  Fort Lee bananas, 
[04:07:30]  is that gone now?  It's there.  Bananas.  I'm working up there  at Harlan's outfit.  Bill Cox's outfit.  The worst outfit.  What would Jim C say  in line at a Jay Moore show  waiting to go  into the theater?  I've been standing  out here so long  I'm going to get  a subdural hematoma,  you little Asian.  Why would you get  a subdural hematoma  from the stage?  Because I'm going to  tip over and bang my head.  What about Boardroom Jimmy? 
[04:08:00]  It's not Boardroom Jimmy  anymore,  you idiot.  It's Ted.  It's all the same guy.  Five guys,  one voice.  He used to be  Frank DeFraner,  let's not forget.  Yes.  Frank DeFraner  turned into Boardroom Jimmy,  which all...  Wow,  do I have to shit.  Good night,  everybody.  Jay Moore.  Hey,  guys,  give Jay some love.  Come on.  They killed for us  today,  man.  And,  Janine,  thank you,  and we'll see you soon.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye. </pre>
