<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a vulgar and sexually explicit opening from Opie and Anthony, immediately setting the tone for the show.  They discussed gifts they’d received, including Kiss 45s, a Hexbug crab, and various Hot Wheels and Lionel train sets, sparking a conversation about the value of vintage toys and childhood nostalgia.  This segment included humorous critiques of the movie *Runaway* starring Gene Simmons, clips from *Runaway* and *The Sopranos*, and a caller who discussed their new Harry Potter Hogwarts Express train set. The conversation meandered through various toys, including Mego figures and *C.H.I.P.S.* toys, and even touched upon the appropriateness of Confederate flags on toys, all interwoven with crude jokes and personal anecdotes.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of a movie about Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War, quickly shifting to an expensive Lionel train set sold at auction, furthering the earlier conversation about toy collecting and museums.  This was followed by a "Cock Talk" segment featuring a graphic phone call with Mars from Puerto Rico detailing his first homosexual experience. The death of Ravi Shankar was announced, leading to a discussion of his music, Norah Jones, and the hosts’ opinions on jazz, with brief mockery of Roland's speech impediment.  Hanukkah/Christmas presents were opened, including another Hexbug, initiating a discussion on gift-giving, Uncle Anthony's generosity, and family dynamics.  A news story about a targeted murder in New York City was analyzed, followed by a discussion of singer Skylar Grey, prompted by a photo one of the hosts took with her. The segment concluded with explicit discussion of the hosts’ sex lives and preferences, along with a discussion of Skylar Grey's and Johnny Cash's music.

The next segment started with a detailed discussion of sexual positions and preferences, and host nudity during sex. Jim Norton then promoted his new advice show, "Just Jim Norton,"  followed by a humorous bit about a fictional hair salon and a review of *Taken 2*. A Pajamagram commercial interrupted before a discussion of Illinois' gun laws and a lengthy promotion of Jim Norton's upcoming stand-up shows and new CD.  This was followed by discussion of Norton’s appearance, merchandise sales, and a Jay-Z subway video.  A significant portion focused on an episode of *Ink Master*, leading to a discussion of portrait tattoos and various tattoo styles.  A major segment then delved into the cancellation of Rick Ross's tour due to threats from the Gangster Disciples. The hosts, along with a Chicago caller, analyzed a video of the threats and discussed the reasons behind the conflict.

A further discussion about the Rick Ross threats followed, speculating on the motives and the use of gang-related imagery in hip-hop, mentioning 50 Cent.  This segment included Jim Norton's graphic description of his personal hygiene routine, his upcoming show about hip-hop, the hosts' differing opinions on Kiss, the rise and fall of Guitar Hero, Norton purging ex-girlfriend related data, their views on *Law & Order: SVU*, racial portrayals in media, and a lengthy discussion about anger management.  Sam Roberts, Jim Norton, and Eric "E-Roc" Nagelsmith were in studio; Whoopi Goldberg and "Who Kid" were mentioned.  The segment concluded with a Pajamagram advertisement.

The show continued with a discussion about road rage, escalating to hypothetical violent and criminal scenarios.  The use of the word "nigger" in *Django Unchained* sparked a debate.  A listener called expressing concern about the show's portrayal of women, followed by Jimmy Norton's advice segment featuring calls about homesickness, sexual frustration, rough sex, and transsexual dating. Anthony Cumia's anger and views on race were also prominent.

The final segment featured a caller whose girlfriend had a drinking problem, leading to a discussion of alcoholism and resources like AA and Al-Anon.  An email from a suicidal veteran with PTSD and marital problems was addressed, with the hosts offering blunt advice. The show concluded with a commercial break and a promotional segment for Stephen Singer jewelry, interspersed with comedic banter.

I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot.  Do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped. 
[00:04:00]  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn to the grow. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like to make the fuck it again?  With Opie the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony the rage.

Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks. 
[00:05:00]  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  He he he he.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show on this hump day.  Hump day!  Work your way up to Wednesday over the hump.  Sliding down the backside to the wiki!  Yeah!  I want to open with a big thank you.  Jimmy Norton. 
[00:05:30]  To Kevin for my gifts.  He sent me some Kiss 45s.  Good thing around Christmas time, people feel compelled to send gifts to our very studio.  And it's like Christmas morning here.  Every morning up until Christmas.  And this morning, no exception.  Coke Logic sent some stuff.  Oh, yes.  And I like his wrapping tinfoil.  Really went through a lot to wrap this.  But Jimmy Norton got some 45s I see there.  Yes.  Some 45s. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, thanks.  Old.  Kenny gave me his knife.  Old 45s from, old Kiss ones from the mid-70s.  Stuff I had when I was a kid, but I don't have any more.  Do you have something to play him on?  A 45 player?  No.  Do you have a close-in play?  I don't.  Remember the close-in play?  I do not.  When sound quality wasn't really all that important when you're playing records?  A close-in play.  You would put the record on, and everything was up in the lid of the, like the needle  and everything was on the lid of the record player. 
[00:06:30]  And you'd close the lid, and it would start.  I'll turn that up.  You close it, it plays.  Open it.  And it stops.  Close it.  It's gone.  Is that Ronnie Allen Rippey?  Stop.  Close it.  All right.  Guy looks like fucking Wayne Williams, the Atlanta child killer.  Yes.  Huh?  That is creepy.  Close and play photographed by Kenner.  Records not included.  Close and play by Kenner. 
[00:07:00]  Wow.  Record not included.  They just wanted to get information out in commercials.  That's what they were about.  Yes.  Chew on the lid.  It's got lid paint all over it.  By Kenner.  Yeah, so we got some presents.  That's pretty cool.  Do you look at those and like, remember your childhood?  Yeah.  Because is it the same labels and everything?  Yeah, it's weird.  Like it says, he says, Merry Christmas.  I'm sending you four Righteous Kiss records.  Righteous.  That is, they're in good condition to listen to or would make a lovely hat. 
[00:07:30]  And he, I guess, put...  Very good hat.  Knowing Jimmy loves the hat.  Hat assembly instructions.  They have a kiss sign on each.  Or teach Ronnie B's cunty little...  All about the...  I don't even know what he's talking about.  The nuances of a glory hole?  Oh.  That one I don't understand, Kevin, but I do appreciate the fucking...  That's pretty nice, yeah.  When you look at 45s and you look at the labels, they do like bring you right back. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  It's like you look at the old Beatles stuff on the Apple label.  It's like, oh, I remember that.  This idiot made me a picture of me with Wow, a Wow shirt and two guns shooting.  One says kapow and bam.  And he has like a fucking hat diagram made out of five fucking little small record.  It's called the five record hat.  And double guns.  Yes.  Oh, that was double guns.  I didn't even get that.  Double guns, sure.  Thank you.  I'll Twitter a photo.  Thank you very much.  That's nice.  Kevin.  Coke Logic got me a hex bug crab. 
[00:08:30]  I guess it's one of these tiny little robotic things that kind of move around.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  Thank you, Coke Logic.  It just moves?  Yeah.  It kind of...  Remember that movie with Gene Simmons and Magnum P.I.?  Yeah.  Remember that one?  And they had the little mechanical, little crabby robot things that walked around.  It looks like a miniature version of one of those. 
[00:09:00]  Does it do anything?  Does it help you with it?  What's it supposed to do?  It's fucking one inch tall.  It's supposed to get me coffee.  It's like a wind up car?  No, it's a little crabby thing.  I don't get it.  It's a little mechanical crab.  Well, it's cool because it's like robotics.  It's got some kind of robotics.  I don't know what it does, though.  That's the question.  Except walk.  Does it have any sensors on it where if it goes to a wall, will it turn around?  What makes that not a child's toy? 
[00:09:30]  Not that that matters because I like child toys.  Runaway was the movie.  Yes, the movie Runaway.  Button...  Did Gene Simmons have a real role in that or was it like a tiny...  He was the villain.  Oh, he was.  He was the guy.  I thought he was kind of...  At the time, I remember seeing that movie and thinking,  Oh, Gene Simmons did a pretty good job.  But then I watched it more recently and all he did was kind of make villainous eyes and 
[00:10:00]  look back and forth a lot.  Your expectations of him were so low.  Yeah, yeah.  In the beginning, you're like, all right, he pulled it off.  And now if I watched it, I'd just see the scumbag that tried to fucking hone in on my chick.  Do you have any of that on the...  What movie?  Yeah.  What's it called?  Runaway.  The movie was Runaway with Gene Simmons.  So get a Gene Simmons part in the clip.  And we'll see some acting by Gene Simmons in Runaway. 
[00:10:30]  What year was that?  84?  Yeah, that was a big deal to Kiss fans.  You couldn't believe he was doing that.  Oh, my God.  That's like a big movie.  Yeah.  At the time.  I don't remember.  I don't know if I ever saw it.  I didn't want to see Gene doing this silliness.  Tom Selleck going up in the elevator.  You're going to have to help me.  I don't know if this is a correct scene or not.  It might not be a scene where we actually see Gene talk.  I think we're going to see some fighting, a little action.  He doesn't have his big boots on, though.  And he doesn't breathe fire or spit blood or stick his tongue out. 
[00:11:00]  Was his name the demon in it?  No, it wasn't the demon either.  What was it?  So Kiss fans didn't like this?  Really?  84?  I didn't.  I didn't know if Kiss fans did.  Why didn't you like it?  Because it was Gene doing an acting thing.  See?  The little crabby things.  They got the little crabby things.  Where is Gene?  I just wanted to see him as the demon.  It's all this Tom Selleck.  Yeah.  Enough with Tom Selleck.  Gene's more handsome.  You think Gene...  Oh, here's this. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, there's Gene.  Oh.  Look, he's looking maniacal.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's just squatting down over him.  Look, Ramsey.  But not good enough.  Enjoy the view.  Uh-oh.  What happened, Gene?  He's plummeting in an elevator.  Wow.  They're fighting.  I hope Gene doesn't have a concert to go to.  They're falling.  Uh-oh.  The robots are going to get Gene. 
[00:12:00]  What the fuck is this awful movie?  No, the little robot things are sticking them with acid.  And they inject acid into you.  Why didn't he just get up?  Why is he laying there?  Ah, it's going into his neck.  This is like a Mystery Science Theater movie.  Oh, it would be great on Mystery Science Theater.  Isn't this amazing how bad the fucking robots are in 84, even?  They were terrible.  These little weird...  They look like napkin holders attacking Gene Simmons.  Here goes Gene.  Gene's dead.  He got injected with acid.  Spoiler alert. 
[00:12:30]  Gene dies in the movie.  Because he tried to steal Tom Selleck's girlfriend.  Oh, no.  I mean, lesson learned.  Never mess with Tom Selleck.  Never.  He's always going to win.  I'm just happy he's okay in real life.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's all that matters.  Yeah, they did have, like, heat-seeking bullets in the...  in the gun that Gene had.  Like, the bullet would go around the corners and see the people  in, like, this weird fucking view, and then, uh...  The future?  Yeah.  See?  Doesn't it look like one?  I suppose it looks like it, but I still don't understand. 
[00:13:00]  I want to get a bunch of them and then lay on the floor and go,  Ah!  And have them attack me.  I'd like that, too.  And then while you're doing it, I slowly back a car over you.  I guess that's another one.  Yeah, I mean, you can get, like, the glow-in-the-dark habitat set now.  And what does it do?  I don't know.  Does it say that it does anything but walk around?  Any sensors?  I like a good electronic toy with sensors.  Is it just a wind-up toy?  It's fucking...  It's got batteries.  For what?  Don't relegate me to wind-up toy status here. 
[00:13:30]  Jesus.  Oh, there's...  I got an Aussie car.  What?  What is that?  It looks like an old...  It looks like an old-school...  Fuck it.  What kind of car would you say?  It looks like an old milk truck.  It's like a wood panel, yeah, old...  Yeah, milk delivery truck.  And what is it?  Got Aussie on it?  Remember making car noises when you fucking...  Oh, of course.  Dude, what does that have to do with Aussie, though?  It says Aussie on it.  Yeah, but what does it have to do with Aussie?  Well, Aussie's on it.  It's got a picture of Aussie on the top from Blizzard of Oz. 
[00:14:00]  A picture of Aussie on the side from Blizzard of Oz.  And it says Blizzard of Oz on the other side.  And it says Aussie on the roof.  It's Aussie car.  Did Aussie ever have a car like that?  I don't believe he did, no.  They just slapped Aussie on a fucking Hot Wheels car.  It's perfect.  That's what Aussie drives around in.  I've been at his house, remember?  Yes.  There were three of these in the driveway.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense, then.  Yeah.  Yeah, you would make sounds.  Playing cars stunk.  You didn't do anything.  It wasn't really much to do. 
[00:14:30]  No, you could only do one at a time or two of them hitting each other.  You couldn't even do two in a row that well.  It just was boring.  Where do you go with it?  Well, you needed the Hot Wheels track.  And the, was it the Tower of Power?  Or was that Johnny Lightning cars?  Hot Wheels had the powerhouse.  Powerhouse.  So you'd take the track and you'd connect to the powerhouse and make an oval.  And then the powerhouse had two, like, spongy discs or cylinders inside it. 
[00:15:00]  And the Hot Wheels car would go through and, phoom, get shot out the other side because this disc is spinning real fast.  And then it would go around.  And by the time it got to the powerhouse again, it would go real slow, real slow.  It's just about, phoom!  And then it would shoot through again and whip around again.  That was the powerhouse.  Look for Hot Wheels powerhouse.  What's wrong with you?  This is the new power tower.  No!  This one has the, look, the hood opens up.  Oh, it shows a little Aussie motor.  So when you're playing cars, you can go, I need repairs. 
[00:15:30]  And then just open it.  Then do what?  And do what, really?  Why do you open the hood?  Why would I want to park my car with the hood open?  Yeah.  The powerhouse is not fun at all.  You just sit there and watch it go in a circle.  There's the powerhouse.  That's great.  Oh, and then it would always fall off the track.  I had that!  That's terrible.  You don't think it's a fun gift?  No.  I never had any Hot Wheels tracks.  I had a mat that looked like the road and houses and stuff.  Oh, God!  Oh, yuck!  That's terrible!  I'm just remembering now, like, the big part of the game was I used to make all my cars get in a traffic 
[00:16:00]  jam.  What a fucking cocksucker.  What a horrible game to play!  I would play traffic.  I would line up all my cars, one behind the other on the road, and then that way I could  just look at all my cars.  Did you go beep, beep, beep?  Sam's playing Asian driver again!  Like the lights in the town wouldn't work or something.  And then there would be a traffic jam because one guy was stuck at the red light.  And then I would just look at my car collection all lined up. 
[00:16:30]  Your imagination's stuck.  Mommy, want to play Rush Hour?  Okay.  All right, Sammy.  Look at him.  Kids love cars, though.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Boys or girls, they don't care.  No.  They love cars.  My daughter asks me to play, you know, race.  She can do that for hours.  Okay.  Is that what she meant when she was over the house and said, play race?  I think I taught her some things.  Yes.  She's been in your house too much.  Race.  But it goes nowhere, but, you know. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  How do you play cars with your kid?  What do you do?  It's just racing around the rug for...  You've got to give you some good shit, though.  You've got to like the little, like, garage thing.  Yeah, she's got all...  What's a newer...  Like, that was what we had when we were children was that fucking horrible track.  What's a new car garage or whatever for little Hot Wheels cars?  Here's the current Hot Wheels power tower.  Wow.  What does the power tower do?  That's way better.  It looks like it lifts the car up with some kind of an auger-based elevator and then, like, 
[00:17:30]  drops the car out the top and then it goes around and around.  Do you know what was an amazingly cool thing when you were a kid?  When you'd get the new little car storage box, it was plastic and you could...  It looked like a little...  You could store, like, 12 or 20 in there.  Yes, in a little suitcase.  You'd drive...  Yes.  You'd take your little briefcase of cars to school.  Like, you're on a business trip.  I have a meeting, mother.  I have a meeting with my friends.  Smelled like really fresh plastic.  Don't wait up for me!  Yeah, and then you'd have a... 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, yeah, all your cars all set up.  That's perfect for OCD kids.  Oh, yeah.  You could look through them and just, like, fucking fix them.  So all the blue ones are on this row.  Well, how much fun would it be to open it up and then fuck the order up and the direction  of all the cars of a kid with OCD?  Yeah, they had to be...  Oh, God.  I would love to scratch a few.  Oh, yeah.  And fucking...  And put, like, sardine oil in it so it didn't smell like plastic.  I'd love to do that to a baby.  He'd hate it.  Kid would fucking weep.  Do they still have those?  What?  Matchbox cars aren't worth money, are they? 
[00:18:30]  No, I've seen...  We always think they're going to be worth money, but they're worthless.  I saw on, I guess, Pawn Stars, some guy brought in a giant Hot Wheels collection, and he wanted  some insane amount of money for it, and it turned out, it's like, no, you know.  Well, they've made, like, so many of them and re-released everything, and there's just...  Yeah.  I mean, you know, there's no market for them.  No.  It's just fucking...  They're just fun to have.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  They give you those...  A little nostalgia.  You look and go, oh, I remember that.  And my mom would be like, okay, it's time for the cars to go, and I'd yell, no, the light's 
[00:19:00]  not green, it's broken.  Oh, you wouldn't.  Yes, I would.  Yes, you would.  I would make all the cars stay in the traffic jam.  That's like a problem you have.  Yeah, there's...  I psychoanalyze that as you not wanting to advance yourself.  You were happy being your age with your mommy taking care of you, and you didn't want  any forward movement in your life.  I also analyze his radio performance as the same thing.  Yeah, you just wanted traffic to stand still.  All the lights are broke. 
[00:19:30]  No one can move.  Because as long as those cars weren't moving, mommy was still playing cars with me.  Mommy was playing cars with you and taking care of you.  The second those cars moved, it's, you know, go to school, get a job.  We sat there until I was 19 years old.  Yes.  Just staring at those cars.  Staring.  Oh, what is that one?  1969 Redline Hot Wheels original store display.  Sold for $8,000.  Eight grand?  Well, you know what?  It's not a big market for this. 
[00:20:00]  It's going to sit in my shop.  I'll give you $300 for it.  All right.  I'm happy with what I got.  Well, I was hoping for a million dollars.  Yeah, I was hoping for $8,000 for it, which is what I paid for it.  But I'm happy with $300.  I think I'm just going to go to the casino a little and maybe go out to dinner with my wife.  You know, instead of it sitting in my closet, I got a little cash in my pocket, and we're going to be able to get a nice dinner.  You know, it's about time someone else got a chance to enjoy it.  That's another thing they say all the time to rationalize, that they were just fucking robbed. 
[00:20:30]  And two days later, they're in the pawn store, and it's like, $8,000 for this Hot Wheels display.  Wait a minute.  How many cars did he have in it?  And were they in good condition?  A few of them were.  Like, he got a good price for a very few of them.  But for the most part, they were just, you know, eh, your collection stinks.  But what's a legitimately...  $2,200?  No.  Legitimately what?  A good Hot Wheels car to have.  Like an expensive one.  Man.  There's probably a couple. 
[00:21:00]  On eBay, you should look.  Probably those collector's items that, like, the ones that weren't really sold to the masses.  Perhaps.  Prototypes?  Things like that.  I remember Johnny Lightning cars sucked.  Why?  Like, if you had...  If you went over Johnny Lightning, you'd call your friend a fag.  Because Hot Wheels were cool.  It's like having GoBots.  Really?  Yeah.  As opposed to Transformers?  Yeah, Transformers was the shit.  That was my favorite picture Eric ever sent me.  He sent me a picture of him dressed...  Him hanging from a beanbag. 
[00:21:30]  And the floor collapsing.  All right.  Did I have to tag that?  Come on.  Not only is he a poor kid killing himself, but his heaviness wrecks the house.  Sorry, Eric.  He just walks out of a collapsed house with an abrasion on his neck.  Yeah, he looks like fucking Gandolfini's ex-girlfriend in The Sopranos.  He's cooking.  He's got a fucking scarf on.  Now, Travis is looking at a little pink one.  What's that?  I don't know.  Something from 1973? 
[00:22:00]  I was alive.  It was sold for $3,100.  I do kind of remember that car.  Well, that was $3,100.  Why?  I don't know.  It's very rare, apparently.  Oh, look.  1968...  What's it say, though?  Why does it say rare?  Is it a reason for it?  No.  He had a very short description.  1968 rare Hot Wheels Redline Custom Fleet Side Orange...  Heiss?  Is that how you pronounce it?  H-E-I-S-S-E?  Raider Special Paint. 
[00:22:30]  $3,000.  Come on.  Let me see.  I probably have it.  $3,000 for a Hot Wheels car.  That one does look familiar.  Oh, it's foreign.  I remember all those...  Oh, it's not on it.  ...the paints and the fucking...  Like, the colors.  Sometimes you see a color on something and think, like, oh, man, I kind of remember a  Hot Wheels car of that color.  Very weird what sticks in your head like that.  Oh, yeah.  This is a German...  German.  It's great.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  So, your little track, how would that make the car...  Like, the track is just an oval. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  What makes them zoom faster at one point?  Oh, it was the powerhouse had those foam things, like wheels in them, like foam wheels  that were spinning, and the car would go through, kind of like a car wash, but the things are  spinning really fast, and it would throw the car out the other side.  Because I remember...  The only thing I never got into when I was a kid, but I could see it being interesting  as trains, my father had, like, old Lionel trains, a few of them, not many, but he was  kind of obsessed with them, so I kind of thought they were cool, but just never... 
[00:23:30]  Yes.  We never had room to have a fucking real Bobby Bacala train set.  Oh, every Christmas I asked for electric trains.  Electric trains, electric trains, it's all I asked for.  Electric trains, shut up!  You got them last year!  Yeah, but I want more electric trains!  And what a dummy I was.  I went to the...  I got brought to the dentist when I was a kid, and the dentist's ploy for kids was to  give them a little, like, charm, kind of toy thingy, like a little plastic fucking... 
[00:24:00]  I don't even know what it was, like...  I don't know, a plastic soldier or something.  A suppository?  A suppository.  Anything really small, like something from a penny machine or something.  Something that you can win with the least amount of tickets?  Yeah, things like that.  Yeah, yeah, just crap in a big drawer in his...  Like a spider ring?  In his office.  Yeah, yeah, shit like that.  And he goes, oh, you know, we have a toy over here if you want to pick from one.  I go, do you have electric trains? 
[00:24:30]  Like, I thought I was going to get, like, a nice toy, like...  What? Dope!  I know!  Ew, you asked the dentist for electric trains?  If I could have electric trains.  I love how disgusted Jim always is with your child.  I'm terrible as a child!  It's not this...  It's the fact that...  What a dumb question!  How the fuck would a dentist have electric trains?  I thought he said toy!  And when I heard toy as a kid, I thought electric trains.  So he said, oh, you want a toy to, you know... 
[00:25:00]  Like electric trains.  Oh, we don't have the...  You said...  That's adorable, but it also makes me want to just drill my fist into your young chest.  Give you a good sock in the heart.  Oh, was I an asshole?  Do you have electric trains?  Electric trains, yeah.  To the dentist.  Yeah, let me get out of the fucking toy stock room I have in the back.  I hope he said no and then asked you, is it safe?  Is it safe?  And tortured your teeth.  Gave me no clove oil.  The Hot Wheels tracks were also good for beating children with. 
[00:25:30]  They were perfect size.  They were about, I don't know, three feet long per section.  And made of a whippy type of plastic.  But the plastic was soft, so you always ended up stepping on the tracks at some point and bending them.  Yeah, they would bend.  Like you couldn't leave them out because you'd step on them.  Or you'd put them away and then they'd get bent anyway.  And you'd lose the tongues, they called them, to snap the tracks together.  They were like little plastic pieces that went on the bottom of the slots of the thing. 
[00:26:00]  And once you lose those, you'd always try to line up the track on the floor without the things that held it together.  And it would last like one time, the car going through.  And then, you know.  Just stop it.  Imminent fucking disaster when the car would hit it.  Well, you can get one in the box for $12.99 on eBay.  $12.99?  That's right, yeah.  For a supercharger.  That's what it was called, the supercharger.  1969.  Toy.  $12.  I bet that person saw that and went, oh my god, we are rich. 
[00:26:30]  I got it.  Just because shit is old doesn't make it fucking worth anything.  So much stuff is worth nothing.  I can't believe how much stuff is worthless.  I learned that like looking at, I was at my dad's house and I was looking at all my old like comic books from like, you know, the 80s and 90s.  And I punched them in on eBay.  They're all worth less than the price I covered.  Than the family photos.  Oh shit.  Sorry.  Oh no.  But you thought like, you know, like when Superman died, you know, they had all these comics and I was like, oh, I'm going to keep these, you know, and they're worth like $2 each. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  They're worth nothing.  Well, baseball cards were jacked up at one point like the 80s and 90s.  No, they weren't.  It was legitimate sales of the carts.  I don't know if this is true or not, but Roland just texted me that somebody just got a new train set on the staff.  Well, someone I bet has room in their new house.  Oh no. 
[00:27:30]  For a train set.  I certainly did.  Does someone have a choo-choo?  Someone likes to choo-choo and has one.  That was good.  Thank you.  That is fucking good.  Now, oh shit.  Now, this is probably just like a regular train set, right?  No.  What do you got?  No.  Really?  What'd you get, Eric?  What'd you get?  Just pulling it up right there.  There you go.  What game?  Oh no, you didn't. 
[00:28:00]  Jesus Christ.  You're a baby.  I don't believe that you got the Harry Potter Hogwarts Express.  I certainly did.  What the fuck are you doing?  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you just get a nice fucking HO gauge fucking old classic train?  Because this one has puffing smoke.  Or how about the LIE?  Colin Ferguson not included.  Puffing smoke.  So does the fork when he's eating.  See, friction.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:28:30]  E-Rock, what made you get the Hogwarts Express instead of a real fucking hobby train set?  Well, the real trains are coming later.  This one is for Christmas.  This one goes around the tree.  That doesn't make sense.  Like a regular train should be the one that goes around the tree.  The regular train is going to be in a whole different section.  A section?  Oh, another wing of the Nagel estate. 
[00:29:00]  This is what drives me.  He's picking up all these hobbies now.  Because he has a house.  He has room.  Yeah.  Like now he's starting Lego collecting.  And now he's starting train sets.  And the Lego stuff is a little douchey.  This is not a cheap train set.  How much was it?  Eric?  What is it listing there?  How much?  Well, I see a bunch of different versions.  Oh, let's say.  Which version of the Hogwarts Express did you get?  Mine, it's solid metal, too.  It's not like cheap plastic or anything.  Oh, well.  Lionel train set.  Lionel. 
[00:29:30]  And I think it was like 200.  That's not bad.  200 bucks.  Wait, is it a whole bunch of trains?  Yeah.  It's five cars.  Oh, all right.  Five cars.  Yeah.  Is it a caboose?  Yep, has a caboose.  And how much track?  Enough to go around the tree?  Yeah, it's pretty big.  And a circle or an oval?  A circle.  Oh, I hate a circle.  It's constantly turning.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, Hogwarts Express coming through, guys.  That's good.  Are you all excited that you're like a fucking warlock when you watch it? 
[00:30:00]  Do you imagine yourself shrinking and going into the fucking train?  Don't you have to like jump on the track or something?  Yeah.  How does that work?  Do you ever, like when it comes to the tunnel, do you go, yay!  Like a big retard?  Yay!  Like a big retard.  I haven't bought the tunnel yet.  Like a big retard.  Oh, shit.  If I'm on my own on this, disregard it.  But I'm interested in what Troy Kwan thinks about the amount of disposable income that Iraq has that he could just buy a train site. 
[00:30:30]  Well, I mean.  It's amazing.  Troy might actually agree with this one.  He might.  Troy's a big train boss.  Hey, let's grab him.  He's a train guy.  My question.  Is he a train buff?  Yes.  Well, he went to Pennsylvania and was on the train.  He likes the train.  Yeah.  That's true.  He likes pulling trains.  At some point, I want to do it right.  Have a whole landscape set up.  Oh, that whole thing.  Like Gomez Adams.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, fuck yeah.  What is the other Lionel one you're getting?  What's the newer one? 
[00:31:00]  You're getting another one, right?  A Lionel.  More of an old-fashioned one, though.  You know, like the ones that would haul coal and things like that.  Not ones that would take Harry Potter to Hogwarts.  Right.  That's just for Christmas.  Oh, for Christmas.  Hey, that's great.  That's pretty cool.  You're going to get an engineer hat?  Yeah, you have to.  And, like, an oil can and just stand there working the little control.  Does the transformer on train sets still smell like it's ready to burst into flames when 
[00:31:30]  you fucking fire them up?  Yeah, it kind of does.  It's like, are there wires just, you know, you'd think the thing's just going to go up  any second.  Every train set I've ever had when I was a kid, you go to, like, start it up.  You plug in the transformer, you hear, like, and then you get the throttle going, and  you smell like this fucking ozone-ish, electric, ready-to-burst-into-flame smell.  When I was, like, when you see, like, I mentioned Bobby Bacala, but when you see an adult with 
[00:32:00]  a real, like, old-school train collection, like, fucking a really nice, that I can kind  of get collecting.  Yeah.  That's like a real collector's...  And they, it's very hobby-oriented because they put together all those scenes.  They put the trees in and all the little, like, lakes, and, you know, it's kind of  a hobby.  You're building it.  But they're, and they're old.  You can buy old ones, like the old scenes.  Poor Bobby Bacala.  Oh, it's the best fucking, one of the best murder scenes in the entire fucking...  Could you turn it up?  Yeah.  Oh, here, poor Bobby. 
[00:32:30]  I'm going to go for it.  I'm going to go for it.  Your son will like this, too.  He's very good.  He's going to...  A nice blue one.  Oh, he's going to buy the train.  He don't care.  Oh, they're showing, if you haven't seen this, they're showing a little train guard  on the tracks, and a man's coming in to not be nice to Bobby.  Oh, no.  Oh, here they come.  Is he, Iraq, pondering buying the Harry Potter train?  Yes, the two other guys from the staff coming in.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:33:00]  What a bad scene.  That's good.  You like it?  Yeah, that is good.  Poor Bobby.  They're showing, like, hearing screaming, and you see the little guys on the tracks with  their hands over their mouths.  Damn, did they fucking fill him full of lead?  Oh, jeez.  That was a great fucking kill scene.  Poor Bobby.  Bobby Buckle-ah.  Wow.  Yeah, that fucking... 
[00:33:30]  Watching those scenes makes me want to watch the entire thing.  I know.  Yeah.  Right?  Absolutely.  Troy Kwan.  Gentlemen.  Wondering what you think about E-Rock's massive amount of disposable income to buy these train  sets, and he has future plans of setting up his own railroad.  Amazing.  The Nagel Express.  The Nagel Express.  You're going to do cars on people?  It's still happening.  Choo-choo. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I mean, he's just got this amazing income coming in, and he's just able to sort of live  this...  Extravagant.  Extravagant, childlike lifestyle.  Yeah.  And, you know, he was talking yesterday, he's putting in more TVs in his place.  What?  Yeah.  He did.  On the after show yesterday, he mentioned that he's got five flat screens in his house  now, and he's looking at adding at least a sixth.  Five flat screens at the Nagel Estates.  Well, he's got a wall.  It's actually a really cool set. 
[00:34:30]  He's got a really nice house.  It's like a living room, and there's a wall there, but you can walk around either side  of it, and around the back of the wall is like kind of a porch in the sense that it's  all glass.  It's indoors, but it's all glass, and he's got on the one...  Is it a Florida room?  It's a Florida room.  Coming from Florida.  Yeah, yeah.  He just calls it Where I Grew Up Room.  Right.  Right.  So he's got the TV on the one side of the wall where the fireplace is, and he's putting  a TV right on the other side, too.  Right on the other side.  It's like a two-sided TV. 
[00:35:00]  Right.  In the wall.  Right.  Wow.  And then he's putting a theater outside as well.  A movie theater.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's going to put a movie theater in his backyard.  I wouldn't know.  I've never been invited over, but I imagine it's a really...  Oh, boy.  I'm very fond of Eric and very fond of his wife.  He'd been invited.  You just couldn't attend.  Well, that's the only reason you did those when I was not there, so I couldn't go.  I don't remember being invited.  He invited you over once when he specifically knew that you and I would both be in San Diego.  I don't remember getting an invite.  You probably never did.  Actually, you said you were coming, and then didn't show.  Whoops.  Right? 
[00:35:30]  That could be true.  Oh, Iraq.  I'm sorry about that.  Where do you live?  Jersey?  Yeah.  Maybe.  We need that shit.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking Jersey.  You're just going to go to an old intern's pool party, but...  Wow.  Yeah, well, live and learn, right?  Yes.  Yeah, I lived and learned on that one.  Especially now that Iraq is decorating his house with tchotchkes.  What are tchotchkes?  It's going to look like an Applebee's in his room downstairs.  Your man cave?  He's going to have trains and road signs on the walls. 
[00:36:00]  Surfboards on the wall.  License plate.  Yeah.  Yeah, nice.  Just a little something to make it his.  Yeah.  Personalize his man cave.  Mm-hmm.  Man cave.  What were you guys talking about on the after show yesterday that Iraq said his wife wouldn't  allow or something?  A scale?  I'm sorry.  Oh, the hot tub.  Oh, right.  Oh, right.  A hot tub.  I was driving home and I'm like, oh, Jesus. 
[00:36:30]  I got to get into this.  How do you...  Why?  What's wrong with your wife that she doesn't like a hot tub?  I was corrected later on.  Oh, you were?  To the fact that she would love to have a hot tub.  Well, then why did you say that before?  Because I honestly thought she had said no at one point.  Well, can you take out?  No, she was commenting on the temperature in the room to him.  It's hot.  Hot tub.  She called him tub.  Hot tub.  Oh, wordplay.  Was there a comma? 
[00:37:00]  Holy fuck.  You like your house?  Was your house built new?  No.  Oh, okay.  It's an old, it's an old, old house.  It feels new, though.  It doesn't feel like an old house.  But it's been renovated and everything.  How far from the city are you?  15 miles.  That makes me want a house.  It's not bad.  It's right by, like, a giant stadium area.  Oh, okay.  How bad does traffic come in in the morning?  It's nothing.  In the morning.  In the morning, there's nothing, really.  It's just jokes galore. 
[00:37:30]  Well, it's a giant stadium.  Oh, like the stadium was named after that.  Well, you know, something.  Something like that.  Now, what did she say about the hot tub?  She would love one.  So you're going to get rid of that silly garden of hers and put a hot tub in there and get  some bitches?  Garden?  Yeah, the house had a huge, like, three-part garden in the backyard.  Waste of prime real estate.  Yeah.  So this spring, we'll get the new fencing put in.  The backyard will be remodeled.  Oh. 
[00:38:00]  Do a hot tub.  Must be nice.  Must be nice.  Troy, man, right?  It's got to feel good.  This guy's just fucking shelling out the money.  Boom, boom.  But a hot tub makes sense to me.  I can see why you'd want that.  In the winter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sit there, watch the snow come down.  It's awesome.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I get that.  But he's got plans.  I mean, I think Troy's point is more all these plans for major renovations, and still it's nothing  to drop $200 on a Harry Potter train.  Me a bag of shells.  Just like, he makes it rain.  He's just sitting there firing off.  Oh, at the toy store. 
[00:38:30]  At the toy store.  Oh, yeah.  Harry Potter train's like, yeah, niggas!  And he's just fucking flying hundreds off.  You think Eric just has a ton of Jeffrey bucks lying around?  Yeah, he does.  Jeffrey dollars.  Jeffrey dollars from Toys R Us.  He's like Scarface, but he doesn't have a lion.  He has like little child things around the house.  The fridge is yours.  You are very childlike, E-Rock.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just got this nice income you can just sort of do as you please, you know?  Right?  I don't know why we all don't do that. 
[00:39:00]  Well, because we don't have that income.  Oh.  All right, look, I might be guilty of purchasing a few toys myself.  Yeah, but...  But, you know.  You're a millionaire.  What are you going to do?  Right.  That's well established.  Make a little more money.  I understand.  Are you saying Anthony's earned it?  No, I'm saying Anthony literally twit-picks photos of stacks of cash that make up about  four years of my salary.  And then in one minute, one hand, they're gone.  Easy come, easy go.  It's like, whoops, the dealer took it.  That's a weekend, though, right?  That sucks.  Ah, you know what? 
[00:39:30]  Did you see all of Eric's Simpsons Christmas items?  Oh, no.  He's got a bunch of those little, like...  Ew.  They would be like...  How many is that?  Like collectibles, like Hummels, but they're Simpsons...  E-Rock.  ...things.  How many do you have of those, E-Rock?  I think there's 33, 36.  Are they in a case?  No, they're on display right now, but...  On display.  Like it's fucking...  Like the museum.  Yeah, like a museum has it for a limited time.  Make sure you see this display.  How much do one of those run?  You have to buy them in sets of three.  And how much is, like, a set of three? 
[00:40:00]  30, $35?  Oh, boy.  Times 11.  Let's do some math.  So, wait, you buy them at toy conventions?  No, you have to order online.  They're special made.  What's the fascination with Simpsons stuff?  I understand the show, you know, you get some laughs.  But what about...  Why so much Simpsons things?  Blocks out the pain.  Same fascination with Harry Potter trains.  Harry Potter trains.  Legos.  Anything.  Blocks out the pain.  Childish toys and stuff.  Yeah.  Yes. 
[00:40:30]  What was your favorite toy store as a kid?  Favorite what?  Toy store.  Toy store?  Was it just Toys R Us?  Toys R Us or KB?  Do you remember Meyers?  KB stunk.  Yeah, I do.  KB stinks.  Like, Toys R Us is cool.  You go in there, there's a bunch of toys.  It's really good.  KB is, like, a lot of very childish toys.  You know why a lot of kids liked KB?  Because they were in a lot of malls.  Yeah.  So they were really easy for us to get.  Yeah.  And Toys R Us was a standalone.  Yeah.  Especially the ghetto malls.  Yeah.  Toys R Us was like, fucking, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  There was a weird vibe when you'd walk in there, right? 
[00:41:00]  You couldn't believe how many, no, Toys R Us, like, Toys R Us, couldn't believe how  many toys there were.  There were toys everywhere.  Eric still gets that vibe.  Oh, E-Rock, do you?  It's not the same now, but.  I want to go into one.  Like, you'd walk in, it would just be a wall of toys, and then you'd go around, and you  were actually in the store.  And a really high ceilings made it just seem endless.  The smart places had high ceilings.  Let me tell you.  It's a cathedral of toys.  It's not what you think it is.  Yeah, it's not what it used to be.  No?  No.  It's all baby stuff, mostly.  There's a big one in the city I went into recently to kill time, to look at the Legos. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, that place is really cool.  Poor Times family.  Poor Times family.  Poor Times family.  He went in there to kill time.  Wow.  I love giving Jimmy a taste of his own medicine.  I still go into Toys R Us like twice a month.  For what?  Wrestlers.  Oh, God.  I almost never buy them anymore, but I can't stop myself from looking. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, I can't stop.  In fact, you know that that's happening.  You're with wrestling.  You're like edging with wrestling toys.  Yes!  Yeah, I mean, I don't really.  Sitting there stroking your pud in front of a fucking King Kong Bundy hat.  Shut up.  King Kong Bundy hat.  The fascination with wrestling between you and, like, E-Rock and stuff is just astounding.  That's where we meet.  Yeah, is that your common bond?  That's it.  I don't get it when you're almost 30, though. 
[00:42:30]  From the skateboarding guy.  Well, skateboarding is actually, I'm doing something that's exercise.  You don't do skateboarding for exercise.  I do, too.  You do skateboarding because it's cool, man.  I do because it's good exercise.  You're actually doing something.  You just sit on the couch.  Look, we all have our childish things that we're trying to adhere to youth with.  I'm wearing a Walt Disney World shirt.  Exactly, yeah.  And you love Disney.  And I love it.  The happiest place on earth.  I, of course, with my electronic toys and whatnot, I love a good toy. 
[00:43:00]  I love a good toy.  Troy, you can fess up the skateboarding thing.  It's very juvenile.  Well, yeah, but it's still fun.  It's not what a normal man of your age would do.  Yeah, but don't you think it's...  No, that's not true.  No, it isn't.  But wrestling, you're just sitting...  And you know it's fake.  You know it's completely fake.  Yeah.  It's entertainment.  Like all television.  Yeah, but you're just watching...  It's like watching a soap opera with half-naked men.  People watch television.  There's actually a huge business for scripted television. 
[00:43:30]  No, absolutely.  And people...  There's millions of people who on a daily basis will sit down and watch it and enjoy it.  Some will even spend money on it.  HBO, for instance.  You're saying that many of the shows on television are fake and scripted?  And I hate to tell you this, but Homeland, whether he's a terrorist or the vice president,  he's actually just a British dude pretending the whole time.  Fucking don't ruin it.  I know.  So you're saying it's not entertainment, it's entertainment, entertainment. 
[00:44:00]  It's entertainment, entertainment.  Okay.  Good way to spend it.  Sam's very good at...  Sam is good at fucking, you know, skirting the issue, as they say.  Well, it's like thinking people come in like scripted television is just like, why would  you watch scripted television?  Right, right.  Well...  Well...  I don't.  I don't watch television.  You're too busy skateboarding.  Skateboarding and looking for the latest fall fashion.  Yeah.  Taking pictures of people I want no part of in lower Manhattan.  Every fucking picture you take of other people in lower Manhattan and stuff when you're 
[00:44:30]  hanging out...  The lunatics.  I look like I don't even want to get near that motherfucker.  There's no part of you that's like, that's where I'd like to hang out.  It's like, yeah, Troy's thing's like, cool, just chilling down here in fucking like lower  Manhattan and shit, and I'm like, ugh, get me out of there.  Yeah, I mean, if you see the freaky people, the last picture I posted on my Instagram was  there was a guy with a cat walking around with a cat on his head, and you're like, what  the fuck are you doing?  That guy, I think I've seen him.  Yeah, he walks around New York City a lot. 
[00:45:00]  The cat like sits on his head, right?  Yeah.  It's not like laying down on his head like a hat.  Yeah.  I wish you were on 58th Street the other day and you snapped a photo of a guy reaching into  his pocket behind another guy.  Hold a smile.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  Is he a beggar?  Yeah, he asked for money.  No, no, no.  Of course.  Of course.  The ones with the animals.  Is that you laying on your back with the slayer thing?  Look at them.  What are they doing?  No, that's a...  I'm getting tat.  My chest tat.  Oh, I could go see what that lady was doing. 
[00:45:30]  What the fuck is that?  He's getting a tat, and then he's fucking hanging out.  And then he's hanging out some more.  And now, like, look, there's people.  What is that?  That's my girlfriend and another chick.  We were hanging out.  What's going on there?  Why are you outside?  It was just a street sale.  I was just like, oh, let's just take a funny picture.  Your girlfriend's very attractive.  Thank you.  A little graffiti.  There you go.  There's a train.  Oh, look at E-Rog's house.  I was at Strasburg Railroad in Lancaster.  You're a fan of trains?  Love trains.  Yeah, I grew up...  I do like a good train myself. 
[00:46:00]  Have you ever ridden a steam locomotive like that?  Never.  You should go out and check that out.  It's a lot of fun.  Now you're just bragging.  And then there's a railroad museum there.  And they have all these old steam engines and...  Old trains?  Yeah.  Very nice.  I remember the Freedom Train out in California when I was a kid.  The Freedom Train was an Amtrak train.  It made its way around the country.  During, I think, the Bicentennial.  Me being a child of the 80s.  The Bison what?  The Bicentennial.  Bison. 
[00:46:30]  In the studio.  Holy rock.  It never ends.  The Bicentennial.  Oh, I saw a movie about that once.  I didn't think it was real.  Yeah, it was the 200th birthday of these United States.  It's like history.  Yeah.  And the Freedom Train would go around.  And everybody was excited for when the Freedom Train was going to be coming.  And it was cool because they had like history inside.  You know, it was like a rolling museum that would go around the country. 
[00:47:00]  And it stopped in San Juan Capistrano at the world-famous Capistrano Depot.  Is that what it was?  That looks like...  I have no idea.  I didn't really pay much attention to that.  That's pretty cool.  Is it the Freedom Train?  1976?  1976.  Yeah, yeah.  Most of us weren't even born yet.  I was but a wee lad.  What are you born, Troy?  77.  Oh, man.  You just missed.  I snuck in under the wire.  That's right.  You just missed the Freedom Train.  Get on the Freedom Train.  That was just fucking Amtrak before they were completely broke, I guess. 
[00:47:30]  Are they broke?  It was exciting.  Oh, Amtrak's always running at a loss.  Doesn't the government run it now so it can't make any fucking money?  It loses money like everything else the government runs.  What's a really valuable Lionel Train?  Those are things that are worth a lot of money because people couldn't collect them like  you could baseball cards.  Well, that's true.  And they had to be kept in good shape.  Things in the box are always worth a lot of money because most kids back, especially  in the 50s and 60s, did not... 
[00:48:00]  Man, did I like opening up a Christmas present and seeing electric trains.  I was like, oh, this is fucking great.  I don't know if I ever got them for Christmas, to be honest with you.  And that locomotive, you'd just be like, yeah, that's a locomotive.  Had some weight to it.  You like it better than getting slot cars?  Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of the slot.  Although, no, you know what?  What was that?  The AMX, was it called?  There was a slot car set.  I remember the commercial had Jackie Stewart, the race car driver, in it. 
[00:48:30]  Look at those cars really hug the road.  And he would fucking do the commercial for the AMX cars or something.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, if you had the car and train set with that amazing one piece, which is the railroad crossing.  And it would have the car track and the train track over it.  And you put it together.  And amazing.  Amazing.  Try to have the train hit the cars?  Yes. 
[00:49:00]  Tyco, thank you.  AMX was slightly larger than Tyco.  I had the Tyco cars.  Tyco.  And you'd...  They were always flying off the track, though.  You'd have to...  I hated having a...  Should I keep it on the fucking track?  You have to pick something to collect.  I had Tyco cars.  You had Tycos, right?  Yeah.  Come on, Tyco cars.  These were great.  You need a big house to collect shit like that.  Like, I saw those Mego toys recently.  Like, I was fucking...  Like, I wanted to buy...  I didn't buy any.  But they're really expensive.  Like, when I had them when I was a kid...  There's a big market for Mego. 
[00:49:30]  Because I...  The little 12-inch...  They're not even good.  I had, like, Hulk and the fucking Fantastic Four, Captain America.  All of those when I was a kid.  I loved those things.  Yeah.  But in the box, like, fucking four grand.  No way.  I can't spend it.  That expensive?  Yeah.  That's kind of crazy.  Just look at them.  Hey, look at that.  To a girl.  She's 20.  Hey.  Want to eat my cock?  She's playing with them.  Yeah, they made a lot of stuff.  A lot of stuff.  Yeah.  They were the first company to, like, license...  I think I see the Enterprise bridge up there.  Holy shit.  That looks like a good one. 
[00:50:00]  Mego Museum.  I want that.  Mego's are the shit.  I had fucking Yugos.  Well, me here.  Fuck.  Whatever, man.  I'll play that game.  I'll fucking date, fucker.  Me here?  Mego?  You go or you're here.  No.  I don't fucking know.  I don't fucking know.  Oh, they made Chips toys?  What's that?  Oh, Jesus.  Yes.  It's Ponch and John and the motorcycles.  Oh, gosh.  So, find me an old, uh...  I had a Chips big deal.  What are you looking for?  A line of trains.  I was like, how on eBay?  Chips and Dukes of Hazzard.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I was doing that.  Did you used to pretend you were Eric Estrada? 
[00:50:30]  No, I didn't really know what Chips was at that point, but the Dukes of Hazzard one I loved.  You did?  Yeah.  The Dukes of Hazzard one?  Was it a General Lee?  Did it have Confederate flags on it?  On the seat?  Inside the wheel spokes?  Wow.  Yeah, and I was riding it around in the streets of Brentwood.  Now it's so taboo to have a toy with fucking Confederate flags on it.  I do think there was a General Lee toy where they took it off.  They took the Confederate flag off. 
[00:51:00]  It's very offensive, I guess, to African Americans, because it harkens back to the days of the Confederacy and sleevery.  But it's the state flag of Georgia.  I know.  Is it really?  Yeah.  The Confederate flag?  Georgia's saying, giving a high and hearty fuck you to everybody that wants to take it off.  Nope.  This is our flag.  I think there should be an element of history in there, and I don't see that it should be eliminated from the view of everybody, tucked away and hidden. 
[00:51:30]  I get why people are annoyed by it, though.  It's like, all right, let it, you know, just fucking.  But a lot of families down there.  They have a history of their family being in the Confederacy and fighting for something they believed in, regardless of if it was right or wrong or indifferent.  You know, so there's that kind of family pride where they don't want to just bury it.  And, you know, the Civil War had a lot to do with other things than just fucking slavery. 
[00:52:00]  Slavery was one part of it.  And if you read history, slavery was really used as a pawn in the Civil War.  You know, freeing the slaves, the North knew it would cripple the South, and that had a lot to do with them doing it.  Not the fact that they were nice, kindly people that wanted to free people.  They wanted to fuck the South.  When you watch, no, when you watch Lincoln, this was amazing to me, he really was, as a guy, anti-slavery.  And there were a lot of, and again, some people may say this is wrong, but there was a lot of arguments that there was a delegation from the South coming up to end the war. 
[00:52:30]  They wanted it over.  And if Lincoln met them before the 13th Amendment passed, the war would have ended, and then he wouldn't have ended slavery.  Like, people were like, they were worried back then.  They're like, if word gets out that you are trying to get this amendment passed and not meeting with these, like, almost like if you're keeping the war going for like an extra month or whatever to meet with these guys, it's going to destroy you as a politician. 
[00:53:00]  If I had a time machine, I'd go back with a Ferrari and pick them up.  But that was a big thing.  There were rumors circulating that the South had sent delegates to meet and discuss terms of ending the war, and that war could have been ended if slavery had been kept.  Wow.  But Lincoln wanted slavery ended first.  Like, he took a big chance, and he had, the whole movie's about him getting the extra votes that he needed to end the war. 
[00:53:30]  I mean, I'm sorry, to end slavery before the war.  So I don't think they did it to break the South's back, because they could have ended the war and still kept slavery.  Huh.  It's an interesting movie.  You should see it.  I will see it eventually.  You know, I have other horror movies to see first.  See, because, all right.  You want to take a break and eat our food?  Yes.  That's what I want to do.  Yeah, and then, I don't know. 
[00:54:00]  You want to answer your train question, Jim?  Yes, please.  I found a post from 2007 saying the single most expensive Lionel train sold at auction for $250,000.  Yeah.  It was a standard gauge set from 1934.  Oh, I got that.  Mint in the box.  Let me see.  I don't have a picture of it.  It's a full-scale set with tracks that go 3,000 miles.  Yes, and a bunch of people.  How many cars were in it, did it say?  God, in the box.  In the box stuff is worth.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Like, what do you do if you buy something like that?  Like, you have to display it behind, like, museum glass, but do you take it out of the  box and display the box separately?  Ooh.  Like, if you can open it without damaging the box, or?  Well, it depends on what you're buying it for.  If you're buying it to resell it, you'd have to leave it in the box.  But some people buy things to display them, because they just want them, so the reason  they get them in the box, because they know it'll be mint.  So you take it out, and you, you know, put it together.  And I think in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, there's the largest toy train museum, where they actually  have, it's like a huge world that they have just trains running everywhere. 
[00:55:00]  Largest toy train museum so far.  Wait till somebody really gets that collection.  The Nagel Estate in Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  The Nagel Estate.  Jersey's creeping up on Pennsylvania.  That's right.  All right.  Be back in a couple of minutes.  Hey, don't go anywhere.  We'll be right back.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Welcome back to Cock Talk. 
[00:55:30]  I'm Mistress Vixen.  Today, we're talking about your first man-on-man experience.  We have Mars on the phone from Puerto Rico.  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man, as of yesterday.  Yeah, I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  Mars, I see here you had your first gay experience last night.  Yeah.  Yummy.  So tell me, what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night? 
[00:56:00]  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I ain't a retentive.  It's so tight.  Mm, sexy.  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick?  He tells me to lie down on my left side, and I'm facing a particular direction.  And then he pulls his apparatus out.  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me.  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God, about two feet long.  Ooh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you? 
[00:56:30]  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second, and all of a sudden, this motherfucker went all the way in my ass.  Ooh, you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like this.  Come on, buddy.  Help me.  Help me here.  Work with me.  Let me do my job.  What was that job?  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Just letting that rainbow-striped freak flag fly. 
[00:57:00]  Come on.  Alcohol.  Alcohol.  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it afterwards.  No, he did it afterwards in front of me.  No, he did.  Ooh, how did he do that?  Uh, what is it?  Toss salad?  You could toss my salad any time.  Ooh, he licked your asshole clean with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars, you are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you.  This is our secret. 
[00:57:30]  Don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week when Cock Talk returns,  and we talk to guys about their first time with a down-low brother, Mars.  I bet you have a story like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Ooh, you little Spanish fly.  You've got me all wet.  See you next week for more Cock Talk.  Sirius XM, and now, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, you're a mess.  Oh, you're a mess.  Oh, you're a mess. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, you're a mess.  Oh, you're a mess.  I really want to see you.  I really want to see you.  All right.  I really want to see you, Lord.  But it takes so long, my Lord. 
[00:59:00]  Yes, George Harrison, of course, playing this, I'm sure, Iraq,  because his friend and mentor, musical mentor,  the man that taught him the sitar, Ravi Shankar.  Ravi.  He's dead.  I guess he died yesterday.  80 what?  90.  90 what?  One.  90 what?  One.  80 what?  Huh?  92. 
[00:59:30]  92.  92.  92 years old, Ravi made it to.  I guess there's something to be said for that whole lifestyle, huh?  Playing the sitar.  You didn't got to hit it.  Peace, love, all that shit.  All the sitar playing?  Yeah.  Keeps you young.  Yeah, sure.  I really want to see you, Ravi.  Now, yeah, I guess God needed a sitar player.  What would you need that for?  I don't know.  Fucking annoying.  I need to have a sitar player around me for eternity. 
[01:00:00]  Wouldn't that suck?  Meow, meow, meow.  Put the fucking thing away.  Not the prettiest of instruments.  Not the nicest sounding of instrument.  And it looks like a pain in the ass to carry around.  Yeah.  Big, long fucking neck on the thing.  It's very phallic.  Yeah.  Just ball-like, you know.  Yeah.  Weight at the end of it.  Big fuck.  It does look very cock and balls-like.  Yeah.  The sitar.  But his daughter, Nora Jones. 
[01:00:30]  Nora Jones.  Ravi's dead.  Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  Ravi.  Passed away.  92 years old.  Jesus.  What did he die of?  92 years old.  Just being old, right?  Yeah, I would gather.  He had upper respiratory and heart ailments.  Ow.  He underwent heart valve replacement surgery last Thursday.  Oh, boy.  And did he die from complications?  Yeah, I guess.  That's what the family said. 
[01:01:00]  At 92, that's a little rough.  Jesus.  I would assume it's tough to have heart valve replacement surgery.  Man.  It's tough to have a cold at 92.  Yeah.  Or a warm.  Oh, good one.  Sam A.  Leave it alone sometimes, Chip.  Really?  Leave it alone.  Ravi.  Yeah, I feel bad for the Ravi family.  Do you?  I give my condolences to the Ravi family.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  And his sitar music.  Without George Harrison, I don't really think we'd know Ravi very much, very well. 
[01:01:30]  No way.  As a matter of fact, they would just be like, oh, Nora Jones' dad is dead.  Right.  They probably wouldn't even say it.  Right.  You wouldn't even know it.  Yeah, because she's not all that relevant today either.  That's true.  Wow.  She had that one album.  They would say former hit maker, Nora Jones' father passes away.  Remember the Grammy sweetheart from that one year and then she didn't do anything else?  Yeah, her dad's dead.  Arrivederci.  What was this?  This is Nora.  This is Nora.  This was the big one.  This is the big one?  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  This was huge.  This one was huge.  I waited till I saw the sun.  Okay.  This is that music.  She couldn't get this glory back, though.  She's a one-hit wonder?  I would say so, yeah.  One album wonder.  Was there anything else off this album?  Feeling the same way.  I don't come away with it.  I think I know this.  This was big.  But I mean, not really. 
[01:02:30]  This was very big.  This was 10 years old.  This is Robbie's daughter?  Yeah.  I remember she beat Avril Lavigne for Best New Artist that year.  That's fucking bullshit.  I was disappointed.  I love Avril Lavigne.  Who doesn't?  Is she pretty, Nora Jones?  Jesus.  Sorry.  What is she?  That's...  Oh.  She kind of looks like Robbie.  She's a decent singer.  It's not that...  This is that little, like, dark club music with a candle on the table. 
[01:03:00]  You just look and tap your hand on the table and nod your head to it.  This is reflective.  Yes.  Starbucks is selling the shit out of these CDs.  Oh, I bet.  It's kind of boring, though.  Oh, kind of?  This is terrible.  Yeah, this album sold 10 million copies in the States.  Jesus.  It's listening to shit.  23 million worldwide.  The only time I get diverse with my music is when I hit the fucking shitter in this building.  And something's playing that I normally would not listen to.  You're not one of those guys who searches new music. 
[01:03:30]  No, it's a lot of fucking jazz in that bathroom, first of all.  I don't like that at all.  You don't like jazz, Ant?  Jazz is so bad.  Really?  And there's all kinds of different types of jazz.  I wouldn't even have known that if it wasn't for the shitter in this building.  They go in there and...  And then there's that jazz that almost...  They're almost playing together.  You know?  And then the jazz where they're completely playing different things.  Drum is...  The piano player's just hitting the fucking keys. 
[01:04:00]  It's awfulness.  You don't like acid jazz?  What is that?  I don't know.  I'm just looking at a list of jazz genres.  There's that many different jazz genres?  Yeah, look at them all.  Jazz genres?  That's how Roland would say it.  Jazz genres.  No, he would probably say it correctly with no problem at all.  He said something yesterday.  Two words completely in one word.  It flowed into one word.  I've really been trying to get better. 
[01:04:30]  I don't know if you've noticed.  Yes, I have.  Since you brought that up.  I have.  About repeating everything he says.  Yes.  I didn't know what he was saying yesterday at one point.  Jazz.  I think he was talking about the 12-12-12.  It's possible.  Yeah.  And then there was some kind of...  Jazz.  Jazz.  Jazz.  Jazz.  He really doesn't like separating words.  No, his mind just kind of runs together.  That's the same thing Menino has, I think, where he just bumbles through everything.  Roland's a bumbler.  But he gets very annoyed when you point out that you can't understand a word he's saying. 
[01:05:00]  I know.  I try not to.  But sometimes, that's how it is.  You just can't.  You just can't.  It's very difficult sometimes.  Ah, yeah.  I understand what it is.  A lot of SHs go into CHs.  Well, yeah.  The SHCH sound is completely crossed over.  No one knows what you're saying, Roland.  Oh, choot.  Poor Roland.  Look at my toy, that CokeLogic, at the beginning of the show, we opened our Christmas presents 
[01:05:30]  for this day.  Or Hanukkah.  You know, eight days of Hanukkah.  How many are left?  Start on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, so like four.  All right.  So maybe I could just make this a Hanukkah present, even though I'm not a Jew.  So CokeLogic is your Christmas present.  Oh, yeah.  And that is about the...  This is a Hanukkah present.  That's a Hanukkah present.  That's why.  I am making it a Hanukkah present because this is the shitty fucking presents they give  for Hanukkah.  And all the Jewish kids would be like, yeah, but we get presents for eight nights.  Yeah, but they're all like...  Eight of these.  Little spider gadgets. 
[01:06:00]  Eight of these.  Like, it's a hex fucking...  What's it called?  Hex bug.  Yeah, hex bug.  And I opened it up and turned it on.  Like...  Ah, it's very...  Sounds scary, right?  That was musical.  It's very bug-like.  It's just weird.  What do you do with it?  You let it walk around.  Look, it's like crab.  Whoa, it doesn't know what it is from.  Is that from the movie or is that...  No.  I don't know what this is for.  Put it on my arm.  I want to see what it feels like.  It feels like Edgar. 
[01:06:30]  It's just walking along my arm.  Would you think less of me if I came immediately?  You should put that on your balls.  That doesn't feel that bad.  I was just thinking, like, maybe put it on your dick.  Yeah.  Well, put it on a girl's clit.  But, like, lick her clit a little bit, then go make a call and put the little crab, the spider on her clit.  I'll be right back.  Eadly, eadly.  Eadly, eadly.  Eadly, eadly, eadly, eadly.  Watch this bitch come buckets.  From the hex bug.  Yeah.  Take this with you.  So, yeah, thanks, CokeLogic. 
[01:07:00]  Looking forward to other gifts, though.  That's a weird one.  I wish I had a...  I got a shitty car.  You got a hex bug.  Yeah.  I didn't even get a shitty car from CokeLogic.  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  He didn't send me not one thing, not nothing.  He don't have the money to send a bunch of gifts to...  He could send another car.  Uncle Anthony's getting the kids Xboxes.  Who?  They want Xboxes.  What if they're listening?  My niece and nephew.  I don't care.  They know it's fucking me, and they know it's, you know...  Uncle Anthony must be the greatest thing you can hear on Christmas. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  It's the creepiest thing.  It's the creepiest thing every other day.  The greatest thing on Christmas.  Uncle Anthony's coming.  I went, oh, no!  It really is a wonderful thing to have an Uncle Anthony, because I will absolutely go balls  out.  Do you outspend the parents?  Literally balls out.  You like buying the kids stuff, though, right?  Yes!  It's fun.  It's Christmas.  You know, I get a bad rap here sometimes on the show as being a curmudgeon, I guess, 
[01:08:00]  curmudgeonly.  I'm a hater of children.  But I gotta tell you, when it comes to Christmas, I'm a softie.  I like a good Christmas fucking tree decorations.  Shit like that.  I forgot to tell you what I want.  Oh, what do you want?  $10,000.  All right.  That's what I'm hoping for.  Put it on your Christmas list.  If you've been a good boy, maybe Santa will bring it to you.  He hasn't been a good boy.  No, he has not been a good boy.  He hasn't even been a good radio person. 
[01:08:30]  You're going to get coal pounded up your ass.  And rubbed on your face so it matches your hair.  Do you outspend the parents, though?  That is rude, isn't it?  I think so.  That's why I was wondering if there was ever controversial.  Well...  I don't think so.  Even if Uncle Anthony's buying Xboxes?  But there's no way of knowing.  I think they understand Uncle Anthony.  Yeah, you can't be like, hey, how much are you spending?  Because I'm going to spend this much. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know how much everybody else is spending.  I...  All you know is you're buying some Xboxes.  I know.  And just buying the Xboxes for me to give to them.  I don't go to the...  Well, you are in the Christmas spirit.  I don't go to the malls.  Yeah.  I love Christmas.  I have my assistant take care of it all the time.  Exactly.  Clearly, my assistant will be purchasing the gifts, but I know what they are.  Yes.  She tells me. 
[01:09:30]  Didn't Michael Corleone do something like that?  I don't know.  Or get...  Get my kids something nice.  Get your kids something nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Some scene like that.  That's me.  I'm just like, ah, go ahead.  Buy something.  No, Ange knows.  She said, hey, you know, the kids are...  The parents were talking something about Xboxes.  Should we get that with the Kinect?  And I'm like, yeah, get them the Kinect.  They love that shit.  Be jumping around like maniacs.  Shit like that.  And then my brother's like, yeah, that'll be cool. 
[01:10:00]  You could get her the Xbox.  And then, you know, when she's not using it, I could play Call of Duty with you.  I see what's going on.  I see now.  A gift for both.  Yes.  Precisely.  And then she said, you know, your nieces and nephews will get them this and stuff.  And then do you want me to get a little something also for other kids like, you know, like Riley and stuff?  And I wrote Ange back.  I said, Ange, don't get something littler for Riley.  Get something just as good.  Something really nice.  Because, you know, Uncle Anthony can't be some slouch. 
[01:10:30]  It's terrible.  Riley won't.  Very good.  Does Riley want, like, a new TV or something?  Yeah.  Something that obviously is going to Travis.  What does little Riley want?  A grandma.  Oh, no.  You brought it up again.  Oh, my God.  I always feel guilty about those jokes.  I really do love Travis and I feel very bad.  And it's hot.  But yet it's just comedy gold.  Are you mad at me?  No.  All right.  God, no. 
[01:11:00]  It's terrible.  Yeah.  I don't have anybody to buy for this year except maybe.  Oh, Bobby.  Can Bobby something when you go over there for Christmas?  Maybe Bobby and his wife I will or my mom and dad.  You know, my sister and nephew.  But my nephew just graduated fucking the army training camp.  Don't you have, like, a new...  I do, but I haven't met him yet.  He's so fucking cute.  Now is the best time to get him a present.  Yeah.  But he won't appreciate it.  He's too young.  No.  Did you call boot camp army training camp?  Yeah, boot camp. 
[01:11:30]  I made a mistake.  Like it's space camp?  Like it's just like an activity.  He just got through at the army school play time.  Yeah, I meant boot camp army training camp.  Army training, sir.  Army.  Yeah.  Wow, army, huh?  Yeah.  How old is he?  18.  Jesus.  Yeah.  That's the one that came in here, like?  Yeah.  He's in the army?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  It's a fucking MMA fighter.  It's fucking horrifying.  It's hilarious. 
[01:12:00]  So.  What happens?  Oh, they get so grown up.  I said one time, they grow up so fast.  Yes.  And I said it to a gang of kids who were surrounding me, and they proceeded to knock my teeth out with their fists.  I remember you when you were little, Laquan, and he punched me right in the side of my face.  Of course he did.  He took my jewelry.  Oh, yeah, some crime there in New York City yesterday.  Wow.  That fucking guy that blasted the other guy in the head. 
[01:12:30]  That was like two days ago, right?  Oh, two days ago, right.  Yeah, that's right.  They showed it on the news, some of the pictures, and I guess they have surveillance video, the whole fucking thing.  Yes.  And this will make its way around to the internet at some point, but the still pic they got, it's some guy in a hoodie, an African gentleman in a hoodie, and he's tailing another African gentleman who's on a cell phone texting.  He's like, I wonder what that text looked like.  And I will be. 
[01:13:00]  He just never saw his death coming.  That's a lucky way to go.  If you're going to get shot, unless he felt it.  From what they say, he didn't feel a thing.  How many shots?  The guy got one, right to the back of the head.  Just blasted his fucking head open.  And he apparently, at one point on the surveillance tape, you can see him, the victim, he turns and looks at the guy right in the face.  And then doesn't even acknowledge it and turns back around.  That guy was waiting for him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This was definitely. 
[01:13:30]  They were there a half hour.  This wasn't random.  This is definitely a beef.  There was a car pulled up, and that guy got out of it, and they said it was about a half hour early before this guy.  That was a really well-orchestrated fucking murder.  They were waiting for him.  Obviously, they knew the guy was going to be there, so something was set up for him to meet with somebody.  And, yeah, that guy just fucking did him up.  Hopped in a car, and apparently they saw the car go through the Lincoln Tunnel later on in the afternoon.  So they went to, maybe they were going to Jersey?  Maybe. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  You better hope that was a stolen car.  If you're going to do assassinate or, let's say, executions this day and age.  Is that the guy?  That?  That's him.  The bodyguards of R&B star, Usher.  Wait, wait.  Go back.  Go back.  I want to hear that.  Fuck am I.  This guy had a lot of legal stuff happening, I believe.  Oh, hold on.  Pause for a second, though, before you start.  Daryl Harrison reporting.  Oh, it's not him.  Well, that guy had, like, 20 fucking counts on his rap sheet.  Yeah, and his family was in litigation with a lot of stuff. 
[01:14:30]  Apparently he had a lot of enemies.  And there's drug shit.  Yeah, a lot of enemies.  This dude.  Let's see what's going on.  By the way, I heard the car was rented, and the police talked to, like, the couple that rented it,  but they don't think that they have anything to do.  They may have let somebody borrow it.  Oh, boy.  Unknowing?  Oh, boy.  Let's see, because somehow they got video of a lead.  I sum it to the ground and bashed my head into the ground.  Wait, go back again.  I want to see who this is.  Why are they talking to him? 
[01:15:00]  That's Usher's bodyguard.  Brandon Lincoln Woodard, Extra TV and Celebrity Justice released exclusive video of what detectives may use as a lead.  I sum it to the ground and bashed my head into the ground.  And the whole time, I was just pleading for the police.  Woodard depicts himself as the victim of an assault in 2004, given by the bodyguards of R&B star Usher.  Oh, boy.  Though Woodard was the one charged with battery in that case, authorities are exploring his connections to the music industry.  They are trying to dissect what appears to be cold-blooded murder that took place in a busy midtown street in broad daylight. 
[01:15:30]  Around 2 p.m. on Monday afternoon, the California native was shot in the back of the head.  The motive is not yet confirmed, but due to Woodard's prior arrest, police suspect the incident may have also involved drugs.  Surveillance video shows a hooded assassin stepping out of a Lincoln sedan, waiting on a fatal opportunity.  Wow, they're showing the video.  The predator reportedly arrived to the scene of the crime 20 minutes before his target took his final steps.  A map attempts to reconstruct the last four steps of what is now believed to be a hit. 
[01:16:00]  Woodard walked west along west of the 8th Street.  Once he approaches the St. Thomas Choir School, a gunman stalks up the seven pieces while firing a semi-automatic pistol.  N-N-N.  Witnesses say the victim fell to the floor gasping for air.  You couldn't say a word because it was all blood all the way to his mouth and his face.  The assassin walks back to the passenger seat of a gray Lincoln MKX, but does so in a calm manner.  The driver did not see a panic either.  Just a few feet away from the bloodshed, they stopped at a red light before making a right turn onto 7th Avenue, heading south. 
[01:16:30]  He was gone. Whoever did it was gone.  The thing is, nobody's seen him.  He was gasping for air.  He felt it.  A family friend told the Post that Woodard, a father to a young daughter, was attending Wittier Law School in California and was visiting friends in New York.  There was no indication that the victim knew the shooter, according to police commissioner Ray Kelly.  Showcases from the scene of Monday's murder had similar ballistics to a shooting in St. Albans, Queens, November of 2009. 
[01:17:00]  Why are you keeping the gun for three years?  You're dying.  Unless it was the windows and doorframe of a house.  A car similar to the one from Monday's attack was spotted paying cash in a Midtown Tunnel toll booth.  Police are investigating the possibility that Woodard was lured to the West 58th Street location.  For the New York Post, this is Daryl.  Why would they kill him there, of all places?  Jesus.  Like, that's obviously, it was a planned murder, but...  High traffic area.  Yeah.  Yeah, you'd think they would have done it somewhere else.  Maybe in a high traffic area, they figured he wouldn't be as suspicious. 
[01:17:30]  He might have been a very suspicious guy.  Maybe.  And hard to get.  So maybe they figured a guy on the street there wouldn't alarm him.  Right.  Yeah, it may be.  They'll get to the bottom of this one, I think.  There's a lot of...  Yeah, if you paid cash, the only way...  What they should have done is that they should have stolen a car in New York.  Or stolen a car in Jersey, left it in New York.  Yeah.  And then...  Or taken the train in.  They should have taken the train in because...  Change clothes somewhere and just take the train home like a commuter. 
[01:18:00]  That reporter really was having a hard time wrapping himself around those words.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it wasn't a very professional guy.  Not broadcast quality.  No, no.  He was trying, though.  Yeah.  You could tell.  Well, he's like a newspaper guy that really wants to be on television.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's not gonna happen.  You can't say showcasing.  It's like me and radio.  Yeah, exactly.  Correctamundo.  Goddamn.  That's a fucking rough one.  But why don't they have the video of the guy pacing outside, the murderer.  Why don't they show the guy shooting him? 
[01:18:30]  Ah, that's probably...  Or is that not on?  Is that not on?  I'm sure.  It's right there.  Look, he's got the gun out.  That's a second before he's shot.  That's like a second before he's shot.  Wow, he's pulling that out.  That guy is just texting away.  Yeah, he has no clue.  He looks like Abdul-Jabbar, actually.  Does he?  In the face.  Oh, yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  Fuck, man.  That's some roofless shit right there.  Roofless.  Yeah.  It's like an old school mob hit.  Yeah.  Yeah, motherfucker. 
[01:19:00]  Fuck.  I'm horny, man.  Are you?  Yeah, I need to.  Over this?  Is that working out for you?  No.  Oh, yeah.  Over this.  The fucking shooting got you horny.  Hey, that chick you took that picture with yesterday in the lobby.  Yeah, she's cute.  I think I saw her video this morning.  I woke up, and the video was on my TV.  Oh, Skylar something?  Oh, what is her name?  Skylar Grayley?  Yeah, Eminem's doing her shit.  She's pretty.  And I think I saw her video.  Did she do a fucking bicycle video or something? 
[01:19:30]  Did she do hip-hop?  What did she do?  Look up on YouTube.  They're really pushing her hard right now.  Is she good?  Yeah, that's got to be her, because she does this bicycle fucking video.  And there's chicks galore in it, and bikinis, and fucking scantily clad.  She's scantily clad in it.  She was wearing, like, sweats and stuff yesterday, but she was wearing them low and letting her ass show.  Yeah, turn that up.  Let's see.  It's Skylar Gray.  She was in here yesterday.  Is she a rapper? 
[01:20:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what this is.  But Eminem's like to do a fair shit.  What a body on her.  You've got a picture with her, Jimmy.  Yeah.  She's got watermelons.  She has a great voice.  She's got watermelons.  She's got watermelons.  She's got watermelons.  She's got watermelons.  She's got watermelons.  She's got watermelons.  I can show you all my talents.  I can show you all my talents.  I can wear a tan.  Like other bitches you can. 
[01:20:30]  You can have all this, boy, and there's only one thing that I want from you.  Come on, let me ride your bicycle.  You're fantastic on your bicycle.  We can get a little bit more.  This is a song Jimmy would like.  She's really fucking hot, man.  Skinny.  Yeah, she went to stretch up to reach something.  I think she was like signing something on the wall.  So she went to stretch up and she was wearing sweats that were really low. 
[01:21:00]  That's Eminem.  Yeah.  He's always doing voices now, Eminem.  Yeah, what is he?  He's doing peewee.  Knock it off.  Knock it off?  They're not funny.  I dare you right across from his fucking station.  I'll tell Sway to his face.  Holy shit.  You're crazy.  That's right.  Get a hook kid in here.  Yeah.  It's a very catchy song.  Is it catchy?  I find it very catchy.  The hook is very catchy. 
[01:21:30]  You're fantastical.  She's too skinny, though.  You think she's too skinny?  Way too skinny.  Are you just saying that?  No.  What Eminem songs did she sing on?  Was she in Rockstar?  Love the Way You Lie.  Oh, that's the only one?  Yeah, Love the Way You Lie. 
[01:22:00]  I don't know.  What's in shape?  Oh, what a body she has, dude.  She doesn't look like she has any ass.  You're a fucking fruit.  No, her ass is not amazing.  He's right.  It's okay.  Yeah.  What's that?  Look at Eminem. 
[01:22:30]  Why is it so choppy?  Because I think they're taking curses out.  Oh.  No.  Wagon screaming.  Yeah, he probably is very sexy there.  I like the chorus.  I think this is a hit.  The chorus is very catchy.  I think this will be a hit.  And it's different, too.  People like different.  Can I call it right now?  Yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Hitmaker.  She's got to get some curves on her.  Look, she's got no hips.  She's got no hips.  What?  The longer the song goes on, I like it.  It's really catchy.  But I still think it's very Eminem corny-ish, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind giving her a big smooch.  Hey.  Hi, Jimmy.  Aw.  You could have yesterday.  You were right there next door.  I snapped a nice...  I look fucking horrible in it.  She is beautiful.  I just look like a fucking fat-necked nothing. 
[01:23:30]  I think I have...  We both have hats on.  I left my hat on just because...  Well, looks can be deceiving.  Not this time.  Not this time.  They can, I guess.  Oh, Jimmy.  Hold on.  Look.  Look at pretty girl and fat-necked McGillicuddy.  Oh.  How fucking hot is she?  There's a little elf behind us.  There's like a little Christmas, serious Christmas elf.  You should make that your Christmas card.  Oh, look.  Three elves.  Hi!  Hi!  We're all elves!  Hi! 
[01:24:00]  Ah, shit.  God, I hate my fucking double neck.  It annoys me.  I think the song was I Need a Doctor, though.  I don't know the song for Eminem.  The Eminem song, yeah.  Is it a new one?  Because Love the Way You Lie was Rihanna, unless there's a different version.  Who sang on Rockstar...  What was it called?  We Made You?  I like that.  I wonder if that was her.  He was joking and he said it was Jessica Simpson.  You're right.  It's I Need a Doctor.  Yeah.  That's Dr. Dre, isn't it?  Yes.  Featuring Eminem and Skylar Gray.  Dr. Dre.  I'm about to lose my mind. 
[01:24:30]  Is that her?  Yeah, that's her.  You've been gone for so long.  I'm running out of time.  I need a doctor.  Call me a doctor.  I need a doctor.  Is the doctor they're referring to Dre?  That's exactly right.  Oh, I think it's a cardiologist.  Is that album ever going to come out?  No.  What album?  Dr. Dre's Relapse.  Oh, Relapse. 
[01:25:00]  Whatever, Detox.  I don't know.  Like his last album.  Yeah, he's been teasing an album for like 15 years, I think.  Yeah.  He's pretty busy doing this shit.  He doesn't need to.  He's too busy making millions off those Beats by Dre.  Yeah, it's the headphones.  Millions, yo.  Yeah, those fucking beats.  And now he's teaming with like Trent Reznor.  They're doing like, they're going to figure out some sort of streaming service with Beats  by Dre.  What the hell's going on with that Trent Reznor?  In a suit accepting Oscars?  He's a smart guy.  Now he's like, what happened?  I want to fuck you like an animal. 
[01:25:30]  He's still doing that.  Dr. Dre puts out the same Eminem song every six months or so.  Yeah.  They're both smart businessmen.  You're going to get what you deserve.  He still does that.  Trent Reznor's had a couple of songs that came with Call of Duty.  Yeah, he did some of the score for Call of Duty.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just sitting in the lab going, this is where I'm going to get my paper.  I don't know anything about Trent Reznor.  Really?  No, I really never loved Nine Inch Nails. 
[01:26:00]  Hurt is a great song, but I prefer Johnny Cash's version.  Ugh.  Fuck Johnny Cash already.  Let's fucking just get it out on the table.  The guy was way overrated.  I disagree.  I disagree.  Talking his way through all the songs.  He was great.  I hate to tell you.  Because you're mine, I walk the line.  That's a really good song.  It's a great song.  Oh, enough.  It's going to be three to one.  Yeah.  Yeah, I disagree.  I have to say, I disagree.  Do you like Understand Your Man?  I like everything he did.  Sunday Morning is a great song.  I fell into a burning ring of fire. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  This is going to be like when you liked the Three Stooges movie and none of us agreed  with you.  Yeah.  You loved that movie.  I did not.  You came in here like that little black kid and you were like, it's hilarious.  Hilarious.  No, I didn't.  We were like, Anthony.  How about The Wall?  That's my favorite Johnny Cash song.  Yeah.  It's a great song.  All in all, it's just another brick in the wall.  Not that one.  Oh, no.  Sorry.  What was that one?  No, Anthony.  It's not that one.  It's about breaking out of jail. 
[01:27:00]  Sunday Morning.  How do you not like...  Wow.  Another jail song.  Oh, look out, Johnny.  Johnny was a friend of mine who spent his time.  Is this your favorite Johnny Cash song?  Staring at the wall.  Yeah.  Staring at the wall.  As he looked at the wall so strong and tall, you could hear him softly curse.  Nobody at all ever climbed that wall, but I'm gonna be the first.  It's a live version.  Introspective moments where you listen to stuff like this, Anthony? 
[01:27:30]  No.  Oh.  Just...  I love to break out of jail.  And it doesn't have to literally be jail.  It could be a metaphorical jail.  Yeah, this is jail.  If you ever touch that wall...  I mean, it's too easy to you as the listener.  If you ever touch that wall...  Well, a year went by...  What's trapping you?  What's holding you back?  What's he laughing about?  I don't know.  Well, a year's gone...  The mean bastard thing...  This might be from Halsman.  Oh, mean bastard.  Same thing.  Oh, wow.  It's gone by since he made his try. 
[01:28:00]  But I can still recall how hard he tried and the way he died.  But he never made that wall.  Oh, no.  Not for you.  You don't like the fable of Willie Brown as a fucking...  What?  Well, there's no man who never shook this can.  You can try that.  The fable of Willie Brown is about a...  It's a lot of times about guys who have fucking arrogance as...  You don't like fucking...  Oh, my God.  Fucking Ghost Riders in the Sky.  It's one of the greatest beats ever.  Did he write that one?  I don't know. 
[01:28:30]  That's a good question.  I don't know either.  Did he not?  Performed the hell out of it regardless.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Fucking Yippee-I-O.  Yippee-I-A.  Let me hear that one.  The fucking beat is just...  Ugh.  What a cool guy.  Dynam style.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ah.  An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Up on a ridge he rested as he went along his way. 
[01:29:00]  Ah.  When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw  Plowing through the ragged skies  And up the cloudy dawn  Great is this?  It's really good.  Yeah.  Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  What is this music called?  Country?  No, it's not really country.  I don't know what it is. 
[01:29:30]  Johnny Cash did a music that doesn't really have a...  That's the beauty of this.  That's why everybody loves it.  It's like movie soundtrack music.  I like Daddy's saying bass.  You do?  Yeah, I do.  But it's very non-Johnny Cash.  No.  You know?  It's good, though.  Yeah.  It's a fun song.  Me and Little Brother joined right in.  Oh, it's a ballad?  Okay, it's a folk ballad.  That's what he sang.  Ballads.  A ballad.  Folsom Prison Blues are not ballads.  It's not a ballad?  Yeah, it is.  You think so?  Yeah, it tells a story. 
[01:30:00]  Oh.  It tells a story and it's like fucking...  You don't like this?  Folky.  And that photo of Gigi Allen meeting Johnny Cash is one of my favorite photos.  It's funny.  Gigi Allen...  Everyone respects...  Gigi Allen was such a piece of shit.  Oh, he was.  But the one guy that he was absolutely would, what is the word, deferential to?  Is that proper?  Was Johnny Cash.  Like, he met Johnny Cash's daughter and wouldn't even act up around her.  So he wouldn't shove a banana up his ass, pull it out, shit it out on stage, and then 
[01:30:30]  throw it at Johnny Cash's face?  No, he met him from the audience once.  He shook Johnny's hand, I think.  Oh, wow.  But he apparently worshipped Johnny Cash, and when he met his daughter, he was extremely  respectful and no shenanigans.  It's respectful to shake Johnny Cash's hand wearing a Nazi helmet?  Well, that's how he dressed.  Oh.  Or whatever he was.  But he...  But, you know, for that guy who throws duty at people...  He does throw duty.  He does do that.  He was just showing Johnny Cash something.  For a duty thrower to respect Johnny Cash.  Right, right.  You gotta be doing something right to get a duty thrower to respect you. 
[01:31:00]  Be like if Cream Pie Jones was respecting it.  That's true.  I don't know.  He was handing him a murder junkie's shirt.  Really?  No, it wasn't.  That's what he's got to say.  And Hurt was one of the...  He was buried in that, by the way.  Was he?  Johnny Cash.  Oh, that's funny.  Hurt was one of the best videos ever.  I know.  And a great song.  It's a great song.  It's fucking...  First of all, it's depressing.  Yeah.  And I know it's supposed to be, but it's just...  It's depressing like any old motherfucker could sing it and it would be depressing.  No. 
[01:31:30]  Yes.  His voice is...  I don't like the Johnny Cash music.  I love him.  I don't like it.  It's very frightening for me.  Oh, I love Johnny Cash.  I don't know.  Well, I feel great to disagree.  Oh, right.  Good for Johnny Cash.  Do it for Johnny...  ...Cash.  It always goes back.  I know.  It always does.  I'm really horny, man.  Yeah, what's the story with that?  Jimmy.  No reason.  Are you flirting?  Have you had...  No.  Have you had relations?  Nothing. 
[01:32:00]  You haven't had relations?  No.  I've only jacked off like once in the last 10 days.  Really?  No, actually, that's not true.  A bunch of times.  Are you losing interest?  Maybe it was 10 times.  Yeah, maybe it was 10 times in the last day.  Sorry, except for those numbers.  Are you losing interest in...  No.  Just, you know, no one else is interested.  I went to eat with my cousin last night.  It was fun.  I mean, it was nice, but I mean, that's...  I'm just doing family stuff now.  Yeah.  Seeing people in my family.  Well, you should do that around the holidays.  Yeah, I guess so.  Perhaps.  Nice, normal dinner with a family member.  Healthy.  Felt healthy. 
[01:32:30]  Did it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It felt normal.  It was like the first normal thing I've done that wasn't weird or fucking self-centered,  just going out to dinner with a family member.  Do you go out with a girl and think, like, is it all about, am I going to fuck her, or  do you enjoy the time that you're putting in?  A little bit of both.  A lot of times I know I'm not going to fuck them.  I've gone on plenty of dinners where I know there's nothing going to happen.  Really?  Yeah.  It's just something to...  It's like, what else am I going to do?  Just do a spot and go home?  Yeah.  Like, I know if I'm eating with somebody, at least I'm eating dinner, and then I go home. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  No, it hasn't been...  I don't try to...  I don't fuck on the first date, either.  I'm really weird like that.  Like, very rarely will I try to fuck someone the very first time I have a woman.  Is that your choice?  Yes.  Yeah.  It is.  Yep.  Have there been circumstances where you could have?  Yes.  Many.  What's that about?  Why won't you?  I like to know somebody a little bit.  Like, I like to have a buildup, and when you...  Like, because then it turns me on more.  Just going out with somebody and them coming over after just doesn't feel dirty.  No?  No.  Doesn't feel dirty? 
[01:33:30]  No.  It has to be a weird buildup somehow.  So you're...  I would think the one-night stand, or the feeling of a one-night stand, that's the first date  that you would do that.  No?  It can be hot.  Sure.  God, that's so weird.  Are you not looking for...  I don't understand why you can't just go find a girl and fuck her.  Yeah, that's easy.  Getting laid is easy.  Just go find a girl and fuck her.  Well, you can.  You're right.  You can.  You know what I mean?  Like, if you're going without...  I'm just fucking bored.  It's so...  Are you bored?  Dude, yeah.  It's really hard for me to get turned on.  Oh, is that what it is? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, man.  You know how it's like you get...  You've spoiled yourself.  I'm like E-rocking toys.  Right.  So you can't just...  E-rock can't just be happy with a toy.  You've got to keep finding the new toy.  That's what I'm like with that.  Oh, my God.  I'm talking to my ex a lot.  It's like, you know...  We're not dating, but it's just fun to talk to her.  Exes are things to steer clear of.  It depends on your relationship with her.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  You could have the most minimalist relationship with an ex, but that's it.  You can't fucking...  Mine is still one of my best friends. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah?  I realize I'm friends with almost all my ex-girlfriends.  I never thought I was.  Why do you do that?  I don't know.  That's weird.  But I guess because we...  You feel like you're keeping them in the fucking...  In the circle of influence?  No, they won't fuck me.  I mean...  You probably liked them as people.  I really did.  And so you still like certain qualities about them.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like you still like to maybe talk to them, hang out with them.  They all made me laugh.  They were all funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like I liked them.  I did like them as people.  I guess you're right.  But I always thought that I hated my exes and we were never friends. 
[01:35:00]  And I look back and I'm like, I'm friends with almost all but one.  Does it weird you out though when you know they have like a boyfriend or something?  Nah.  At one point, the more recent it would...  Like my last one it would because it's my most recent.  But like the one before her...  No.  It doesn't.  Like we don't talk about it necessarily.  Yeah, yeah.  But I don't know why we don't talk about it.  I guess because it might be...  Neither one of us knows how the other would take it, I guess.  But I know she's dated since then.  We've broken up for fucking four years or whatever.  Of course.  Yeah.  Wow.  I hope she has.  Four years? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Not my most recent one but the one before her.  Holy shit.  I think we broke up in maybe closer to five years.  Wow.  God damn.  That fucking went fast.  Yeah.  But we're still friends.  We didn't talk for like eight months or a year.  She hated me.  Yeah.  You need that decompression time.  You need decompression time.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's nice to see them after a while and have dinner.  Like we had dinner in New York and it was like, man, I fucking really miss hanging out  with her and having her as a friend and both of my exes, my most recent exes, moved  to California.  Yeah.  They cannot get far enough away from me. 
[01:36:00]  How can we...  Without taking a steamship.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Wow.  Yeah.  They cannot get far enough away from me.  You don't stay friends with your exes, though, Ian?  I'm trying to think of the whole thing behind it.  I never did.  But like lately, there's kind of...  Like Melinda, I talk to her still.  But it's also because I think part of it's because her sister and brother-in-law are friends. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Right.  So, you know, that kind of thing.  And she's, you know, not an asshole or anything.  Plus, you were together for a long time.  So, it's not like...  Yeah, but that doesn't matter.  I tell you.  Yeah.  You liked her as a friend, too, though.  She made you laugh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You guys had fun together.  Yeah, yeah.  She was cool.  I got no problems with her.  I think I didn't hang out with any exes before her because up till then, like, it was the  be-all, end-all kind of thing. 
[01:37:00]  Like, if I was in a relationship, oh, boy.  Ah, ah, like, sex was this big fucking thing.  And I didn't want to even know them after that.  Because if I knew they were, you know, having sex with someone else, ah, it would fucking  freak me out.  Yeah.  They were jealous.  So, I never stayed friends.  Then I reached a point where, for some reason, I just didn't give a shit.  It's like, all right, fuck whoever you want.  If you want to still text, that's fine.  I learned to make it dirty and be turned on by it.  Like, instead of a chick's sexual history being threatening and scary, because that's 
[01:37:30]  what it is for a lot of people.  It's scary.  And it's, like, you feel like you're not going to measure up in performance or size or  whatever.  But then when I make it dirty, because I'm a pervert, it's like, oh, yeah, look at,  like, who cares?  It has nothing to do with me with measuring up.  That's weird.  No.  It has all to do with, like, that was something that was very, very special between us.  Okay.  And it can't just be some other dude being special in the same way.  You're going to share with him what she shared with me.  What the fuck? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  It's emotional.  Yeah, very emotional.  It had nothing to do with, like, you know, oh, I bet he's deep-dicking her a lot better than  I did.  Well, you know, he's probably not.  I think Anthony's a good fuck.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Like, I've heard Anthony talk about fucking enough, but, like, just, Anthony gives a good,  deep fucking oil derricking.  And you mentioned a certain limo ride that you shared with him.  Well.  At one point, yeah.  I mean, fucking, uh, many years ago, yeah.  He had some shenanigans.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  I was on the way to an event in Long Island.  Yeah, you don't know.  I watched a...  Yeah, sure.  Anthony's got a fucking big guinea prick.  Deep fuck, deep fuckumia, his nickname was.  Anthony Deepfuck.  That was his fucking high school yearbook.  Fucking, you know, Jim, squeeze the head in before the erection goes away.  That's my nickname.  Oh, my God.  Fucking, yeah.  I got a shoehorn in there.  Fucking zilch.  So, physical inadequacies are probably not on the forefront of Anthony's mind. 
[01:39:00]  No.  I wouldn't think that.  Well, no, the second time around, there's definitely, um, you know, you gotta keep your  concentration up, you know?  Keep that concentration.  You might have to squeeze the bass, like a fucking water balloon.  You just keep squeezing it, get it?  Yeah.  But that's, like, after you fucking came once already.  Then you gotta, like...  Then you, uh...  Yeah, I don't know.  What do you mean?  What?  There's a movie.  I'm actually writing a new autobiography.  It's called One and Done. 
[01:39:30]  One and Done, a love story.  Oh, man.  Are you a double load blower, Sam?  No way.  I don't even think I've ever had sex twice.  I don't think I've ever finished twice in the same 24-hour period.  Wow.  I don't think so.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I'll jerk off in the afternoon and then try to have sex later.  You lose your rod?  Yeah, and she'll be like...  You've never been so impassioned?  I've actually been asked, did you jerk off later?  Earlier today?  And I'll have to go, yeah.  Oh, man. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, I did.  I'm sorry.  That's all right.  Travis, how about you?  Are you a two-cum guy?  Yeah.  You are.  In a row?  I can, sure.  See, I can't do that.  My buddy used to...  He would have sex and he would come in a girl and he would just keep going.  And there are guys that can do that where they just, with their own juices, just keep  pounding away.  And I can't...  I've tried that before, except then, like, and I'll think, I'll be like, yeah, I could  do this again.  But then it, I mean, it just floats away with a second.  It floats away, yeah.  Oh, boy.  You can try it?  Floats away.  In a condom or no? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Good for you.  Ah, look at that.  Good boy.  Good answer.  Good boy.  Good answer, TT.  Because, like, you'll stay hard for maybe, like, 15 seconds after.  It's like, oh, I'm doing it.  Yeah, you can use that.  But then it's just gone.  And you go, okay.  Oh, boy.  We're all set here.  Oh, boy.  What will you say when you, like, I know how dirty I am.  Like, I don't know how normal people get into it.  Like, if you want to start, like, banging your girl, or are you, like, what do you, do  you start by kissing their neck? 
[01:41:00]  Or do you start by saying something dirty?  Or is it just this both knowing and leaning?  I don't understand how...  Wow, how do you do it?  Usually, a lot of times, I'll kind of put my dick in her mouth.  Sound of an opening wallet.  First thing is the doorbell.  And then there's the, hi, I'm Jim.  What gender are you?  No, it'll usually start some other way.  Like, kissing the neck a lot of times. 
[01:41:30]  Or other things, a lot of times, oral sex, or I'll talk dirty to them, or I'll put my cock  in their mouth, or I'll talk.  I can't just start kissing, and then...  I wouldn't think a cock in her mouth is the stepping stone to sex.  That is sex.  That's, to me, before intercourse.  I mean, that's the first...  Like, I can never just...  I have to be in the middle of something and go, okay, now I want to fuck.  Like, I never start off going, let's kiss, and then I'll just put it in.  Doesn't happen.  Yeah, well, no, I don't think...  You're talking about, like, foreplay? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, I like a lot of foreplay, some dirty talk.  Yeah?  But if a girl...  I hate...  Here's what I hate.  I hate when a woman expects something from me.  I hate when a woman expects me to fuck her.  It doesn't turn me on.  Expects you to fuck?  I don't like expectations.  It puts pressure on me.  I don't get it.  And because it's like, you want to feel...  That's not dirty.  It's not dirty.  Like, when she expects you to, it's like, ooh, you know.  I wasn't expecting to do this for now.  But how do you start?  I don't care.  Not even just what you're...  But in the past, you're the other girl.  No, it is.  It's kissing, and then, like, sometimes you're just kissing, but then you start kissing a 
[01:42:30]  little more, and then you're like, okay, and you start...  Will you say anything, or no?  No.  No, it's just silent kissing.  No talking.  No talking.  But when you fuck, do you make eye contact when you fuck?  At points, sure.  Really?  No, I won't, like, lock eye contact.  Not with the chick I'm fucking.  Yeah, exactly.  With her mother.  With the mirror, like American Psycho?  Yeah, I just start flexing.  You flex in the mirror.  Then I look over, and there's my autographed Hulk Hogan picture on the wall.  Yeah!  There it is. 
[01:43:00]  I met Hulk Hogan!  Yes!  No, yeah, not a lot of talking.  Like, kissing.  Where do you put your head when you're fucking?  Like, in her neck?  Or, like...  Jeez.  I'm really curious to where guys...  It depends.  Well, there's many different positions.  Yeah.  I mean, when you fucking make sure, like, I need my nipples played with.  You know, I have to be above.  I can never be, like, right on top of her fucking.  I can never, like, be face and neck fucking.  Sometimes I'll be above, but other times, you know, you get in close, and you kind of bury  your face in her neck. 
[01:43:30]  Right?  God bless you.  Yeah, you do that.  Sure.  Then there's just the push-up position, where you're up on your arms.  Then you get, like, the distant view of the face.  And then you could look down and go, oh, look at my dick going in and out.  That's cool.  When you're in the push-up position.  Is that what you think?  Yeah, I think.  That's cool.  That's like in the movies.  That's like in a porno.  I like to be able to see total and complete nudity, like, from that.  So I could look down and be like, like, from head to toe, I like seeing, like, all that 
[01:44:00]  that's going on.  You don't like a skirt still on?  No, I don't like that.  I don't even like, like, a sheet or a blanket over the legs or something like that.  I want it all right there.  You get to take all the covers off.  Yes.  T'Anthony's a weirdo.  He doesn't like fucking thigh highs or Johnny Cash.  I could never be you.  Well, no.  I require those things.  Johnny Cash and thigh highs.  That'd be interesting.  I just don't get it.  I don't think it's weird.  I think you guys are normal.  I just don't.  Yeah.  It's normal.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  I envy that ability.  I remember I was fucking a girl one time, and I'm looking at her, and she's looking.  Her eyes are closed.  You know.  She didn't want to see the shot fired, I guess.  But she was enjoying it, and I remember thinking, like, where is she?  Like, what do you think?  Like, how can you zone out and just enjoy it?  She's probably thinking, like, this is great.  It feels good.  I doubt it.  Oh.  But, I mean, I can't zone out.  I have to be constantly stimulating myself.  It's like constantly fucking rewiring or I lose it. 
[01:45:00]  I can't quite get a grasp on what you're saying.  I know.  Like, I can't quite be a grasp.  I'm probably not saying it well.  No.  But I will say it well on my new advice show today at 10 a.m.  10 a.m.  Right after this very program, Jimmy Norton, his advice show.  What's it called?  Your friend, Jim Norton.  Just Jim Norton.  No.  I'll tell you why I didn't go with your friend, Jim Norton.  Because someone told me that Alison Rosen's podcast, and she's a friend of mine, I've  done hers, is called Your New Best Friend, Alison Rosen.  And I didn't realize that, so I don't want anything that's stepping on what, you know,  she had that first.  Don't step on it.  Are you going to try and come up with a new name? 
[01:45:30]  Nah, who gives a fuck?  It's like, you know, a clever name is, you know, hey, you know, helping Jim.  Just Jim Norton show.  Jim Norton show.  If I can't get people to listen with my name on it, then I should just go fuck myself.  Jim the Friendly Helper.  I like Jim the Friendly Helper.  Friendly.  But you wouldn't say it like that.  You'd have to say, it's time for Jim the Friendly Helper.  Oof.  His little songs.  You don't like that?  No.  What do you want to listen to later?  Jim the Friendly Helper. 
[01:46:00]  Friendly Helper.  Your head dips down.  All of his little tunes and songs and stuff have that moment where you could dip your head  down.  Yeah.  You make kind of a fist with your hand and you give it the little sideways punch up, uppercutty  sideways thing, and your head goes down and then back up again.  It goes, Jim the Friendly Helper.  And your head has to tilt left and right with your arms out in the away we go pose.  Away we go.  But I'll give out the number and stuff and people hopefully will call in. 
[01:46:30]  Yes.  And I don't know.  I hope it goes well.  Because it's going to be here every Wednesday.  So if you don't like it, get ready to fucking find new programming every Wednesday.  I'm going to listen on the drive home.  I don't need that pressure.  That's for sure.  Oh, please.  You know what they're used to.  Maybe I'll call in for some advice.  Oh!  Be happy.  Do you think some of your fans are going to be upset that you're not on?  No.  You know what they're used to at 10 o'clock?  It's not a tough hour to film.  Oh.  I've set the bar very low.  That's true. 
[01:47:00]  It's like I'm fucking following something popular.  I don't know.  That's exactly right.  I'm nervous.  You'll be fine.  Are you nervous?  No.  There's not.  I mean.  No, I'm not.  Good.  And I'm not cocky, but it's like, oh.  It's literally, people are listening to you on this show, and then you'd be like, I'm  Ant's leaving, and I'm going to stay here.  And then people would just keep listening.  Right.  And the subject I'm talking about today is.  It doesn't matter what it's called.  It doesn't matter.  None of it matters.  Like, they just will keep listening because you're here.  The reason I'm doing it on this channel is just because it obviously makes sense. 
[01:47:30]  And there's replays.  There's very little time on this channel I can do it.  Weekends, I'm gone.  And from 10 to 11, there's already a built-in audience to do it live as opposed to, and  I know that it's going to, like, I don't want to go to all of a sudden go to a raw dog or  something in a new studio and have, ah, the phones aren't working.  What's the number?  It's like, this is just people are already here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's a way to kind of get it moving.  I don't know how long it'll stay at this time or if it'll be, it's going to be replayed,  I guess.  But I don't know.  We've established a massive live audience already in the 10 o'clock hours. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which dwindles by the time poor Ron and Fez come on.  That's not true.  They're rebuilding from scratch.  Oh.  That's not true.  Sam is known as the palate cleanser.  You're the fucking.  You're a sorbet.  You're the sorbet.  You're that little fucking.  That's not true.  You're the ginger of sushi.  That's simply not the case.  Oh.  It's not bad.  I got to make wee-wees.  All right.  We'll piss.  And tomorrow we have Tarantino.  I'm very psyched.  I know.  I got my poster out of the frame.  Well, actually, anged it.  I got the poster out of the frame.  Yes.  The thing is.  Every time you said I blank, actually anged it. 
[01:48:30]  It's always anged.  The thing is, I can't roll it up and put it in a tube because it's back matted, you know?  So don't do that.  I am.  It's linen.  Yeah.  Very delicate, though.  Be very careful.  Make sure it's not raining.  Right.  Hopefully, you should get something today.  I got plastic over it.  Big piece of plastic.  Yeah, it's worth doing, man.  Yeah.  I'm going to get him to sign.  I'm going to try to get Travolta today.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to pull that off, but I would love to get him and Quentin  on the same.  Pulp Fiction.  Yeah.  I'll leave it there and see if he can get it. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  I'm going to make wee-wees, and we'll be right back.  Hey, buddy.  Welcome to Antonio's.  Sit down.  What are you looking for?  A simple trim?  Straight black hair.  Do not rake.  Well, we can't do much as far as color.  I bleach brown hair sometimes.  Okay.  You do that.  What is it you want me to do for you?  Want a nice, big hair with a lot of body.  Body?  Get a hairstyle.  Look like a hot stew.  All right.  I can give it a try, but I can't make no promises.  I get tears for fears. 
[01:49:30]  The who's for what?  I get a frock of a seagull.  What's that, like a feagull or thing?  Do not rake not attractive to a female.  Whatever you say, karate kid.  How about I take some off the sides, leave it long on the back?  Look like a Bay City roller.  Yeah, sure.  Whatever you say.  So, uh, no ladies in your life?  When trying to get an American girlfriend.  So that's why you're here.  Well, you gotta just keep trying out there, buddy.  Eh, hungry like a wolf. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, well, there's a sandwich place down the block.  Well, there you go.  What do you think?  I look very sexy.  Yeah, right.  Great.  Look good.  Glad you're satisfied.  All right, Fu Manchu, hit the bricks.  I get on there with a skateboard wrong board.  He forgot his fucking glasses.  Hey, buddy, you forgot. 
[01:50:30]  Yikes.  That's not what I meant when I said a little off the top.  Coming up this week on At The Movies with Norton and Voss, the guys review the latest Liam Neeson thriller, Taken 2.  It was awful.  It was great.  It stunk.  It was fucking great.  Terrible story.  I loved it. 
[01:51:00]  It was predictable garbage.  Don't fucking, don't be scared of him.  You loved it.  It was terrible.  It was a terrible movie.  I love Liam Neeson.  I think he's amazing.  Her big dad, stepdad, have pony.  And then at the end, he brings the fucking big singer.  I saved her life.  Oh, it was fucking horrendous.  It was good action, though.  I mean, it was good.  The action was good, yes.  But so what?  That's all coming up on the next At The Movies with Norton and Voss.

[01:53:00]  Doodly-doo.  He said this iPhone's a piece of shit and threw it off the balcony.  Hoodly-doo.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right, all right.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, all right. 
[01:53:30]  Here come the floor.  Woo!  All right, all right.  This sounds dangerous.  It sounds gangster or something.  Is this gangster?  I'm hearing some gangster.  Yes, Kenny?  Close odor?  Speaking of gangster, the gun laws are going to change in Illinois.  I heard about that.  Yeah, good for them.  Apparently, the courts over there in Illinois decided that they can't keep people from carrying a concealed weapon around the city, around the state. 
[01:54:00]  But they'll put all kinds of regulations in there and make it like New York City where it's almost impossible to get anywhere.  Yes.  But at least it's there.  But at least now they just can't outright deny people from defending themselves.  To step in the right direction.  It certainly is.  Let the law-abiding citizens have a chance at protecting themselves for the love of God.  And that's how they were, the courts over there were interpreting the Constitution that, yeah, you know, they do have the right to do that. 
[01:54:30]  But Illinois is going to have a bunch of problems with trying to regulate it.  And it's just, it's going to be, it's not going to be like, oh, great, the law is different.  Now we can just all buy guns, you know.  Yes.  I wish it was that simple, Anthony.  Well, wouldn't you, Kenny?  Yes.  Thanks for bringing that up, though.  Well, I try to contribute here and there.  Well, a lot more there than here.  Jim's got a lot to talk about.  Yes.  You know, he's going back to Bogota. 
[01:55:00]  I can't wait.  Oh, I feel pleased.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I feel bad just plugging my shit.  Why?  You're right.  Bogota.  It's tickets are on sale this Friday.  I'll be with Artie Lang, David Tell, and we've added Amy Schumer.  Nice.  That is February 17th.  President's, I think it's, is that President's Day?  Yeah, President's, that's Sunday, so people are off Monday.  So let's party, people.  Yeah.  And it's one of those things.  My new CD is out.  Yeah, I'll be selling it there, too. 
[01:55:30]  I'm very happy it's out.  Meet Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I sell merchandise at the shows.  That's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you can get it online now at Amazon or iTunes.  It makes a great holiday gift.  Oh.  Kenny just barks at people.  It's very funny.  Buy something.  He's actually got me to fork over cash for my own merchandise.  He is funny like that.  He shames you.  He does shame the people into buying stuff online.  Yeah.  Just like, no chit-chat.  Just get your money out.  Buy something.  Move along.  Yeah.  You know, because Jimmy graciously, he takes pictures and all the talent. 
[01:56:00]  You know.  Yeah, yeah.  You guys, you sign everything.  Oh, of course.  You know, you have to listen to everybody's life story.  Yeah.  Everybody's got a story.  Everybody.  Yeah.  There's a million stories in the Naked City.  Yeah.  I wish there was a million naked people instead.  Ah, good one.  Or one quiet one.  And he laughs.  And then come see me New Year's Eve in Buffalo.  Kenny will be there.  I've canceled.  Kenny is going to be there.  Yeah, Buffalo. 
[01:56:30]  Jim's got a whole bunch of stuff coming up.  He's going to be in a lot of places.  What if we wanted to find out where Jim was going to be on one, maybe, central.  We're working on my website now, but why would it be done?  He's got an app, too.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  The app, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't care about any technology.  It's just so depressing.  This technology shit.  And Jim's got new technology on his Facebook fan page.  Oh.  Do I?  Yeah, there's a link to buy stuff on there now.  Oh, good.  Oh.  Like, he's got a store. 
[01:57:00]  Well, go there, then, too.  I'm sick of my own.  Please, no more plugs.  I love you, Kenny.  Thank you.  No more.  No more.  Did anybody talk about how skinny you're getting?  Well, that's pretty obvious.  Yeah, people have commented on it, and I'm always very grateful for people's compliments.  What is that picture?  That's my Facebook photo.  Thank you.  It's a Facebook fan page.  That was beautiful.  That was from Fashion Week when I did that for The Tonight Show.  That was one of the outfits they tried on me.  Wow.  Do you look like a gay gentleman?  There was a couple of different ones like that that I tried, but that one in particular was...  That's a good one. 
[01:57:30]  Jim's Digital Store.  That one in particular was fucking brutal.  Very gay.  Yeah.  You buy all his CDs, see?  Boom.  One-stop shopping for holidays.  Fucking Kenny.  You're making me uncomfortable.  I'm just so sick of myself.  Well, 12...  But thank you, Kenny.  12.  The concert's tonight, right?  12.  Yes.  The 12, 12, 12.  I can't wait to go and see these various...  I'm not going.  What about the kid that was born at 12 after 12? 
[01:58:00]  12, 12?  Yeah.  12, 12, 12.  Yeah.  At 12, 12.  At 10.  You can't even get it right.  Yeah, yeah.  What about they say, well, it's going to be quite some time before this rolls around again.  Isn't that true for every date?  Of course.  But you know what we've got to look forward to now?  What?  11, 12, 13.  That's true.  All right.  All right. 
[01:58:30]  But I mean, I don't know if I'm going to look forward to it.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not really going to look forward to it.  Yeah, why would you?  Yeah, it's not...  I mean, that's not a...  Yeah, I don't think I want to look forward to that.  I don't care.  Yeah, I don't care either.  It's less than a year away.  Well, not everybody can be as optimistic as me.  And love life.  Is this mine or yours?  Water.  I didn't touch it.  Okay.  Water.  Yeah, the big concerts tonight.  I guess it's broadcast on many different stations.  Oh, wait a minute.  What time does that start?  Mm-mm.  It is on Epix, yeah.  But it's on a lot of them.  What time? 
[01:59:00]  Four o'clock.  Four?  No.  I was going to say...  Seven.  You got me.  Seven-thirty.  I'll tell you why I'm asking, because I'm going to a screening tonight, because we have  Tarantino tomorrow, and I'm like, I've got to go past that area to get to the screening.  That's going to be a madhouse.  You think?  It's down by the garden?  Yeah.  No, it's past the garden.  Let's take the subway.  Yeah, I think I will.  There won't be anybody playing or performing in the subway.  Why is that?  Just go right past it.  Jay-Z took the subway.  No, he thinks it's...  I mean, he's saying, like, it's going to be a madhouse, but it's...  If you just take the subway.  That's not true. 
[01:59:30]  Jay-Z took the subway.  It was so crowded.  You see that video?  It's crazy.  I did see that video.  Why did he take the subway?  Because he's a man of the people.  Yeah, when he went to his concert at the Barclays, they finally put out the video.  With his 50-person entourage, and he just walks right into the subway.  Of course.  And then some old broads started talking to him.  Didn't know who he was.  He looked very uncomfortable waiting for the train.  I probably would be, too.  Yeah, I mean, there's hundreds of people around him on a subway platform.  Yeah.  Were they staring at him?  Yeah.  No, they were like...  Did they recognize him?  Yeah, they were, you know, surrounding him.  They were trying to get to him. 
[02:00:00]  Was he taking pictures?  No, that's why he had security around him.  Oh, that's stupid.  Taking a subway.  Yeah.  That's a pompous thing to do.  It's Brooklyn.  That's like, look at me.  He needed to pump his ego up.  Bloomberg does that a lot.  Every day he does it.  Yeah, yeah.  But for him, it's because he has state trooper bodyguards, and he wants to...  Exactly.  It's not like, oh, Bloomberg's just taking the subway with us.  Yeah.  He's trying to make a point, like, look at how I do it as the mayor.  Well, you can do that. 
[02:00:30]  We can all take the subway and save energy and money.  No.  You fucking get an armed entourage.  No one's ever going to stab him on a subway train.  Right.  Or push him in front of the tracks.  It's never going to happen.  Right, right.  Push him on the tracks.  Let me see, Travis, some of this video.  Stop futzing around over there.  Yeah, what are you doing over there?  Time of your life.  What are you doing?  Here we go.  Oh.  You got to do a phone-er.  Oh, you got to phone-er.  You whispered that into a mic.  Oh, my God.  You whispered that. 
[02:01:00]  He always whispers into mics.  What time?  A little late.  Oh, Jimmy.  A little late.  Go do your phone-er.  No, I...  No.  Oh.  Oh.  It's okay.  He was just about to watch Jay-Z get on a subway, Kenny.  I know.  Brooklyn?  Did he get on in Brooklyn?  Oh, yeah.  He was going to Barclays.  Oh, is he fucking...  From where?  Sorry, I didn't...  There's certain things happening today that we weren't planning on happening, so I had  to do something to promote the Borgata, and we should have just taken a break, and I 
[02:01:30]  would have done it then, but we didn't plan out the breaks, because I didn't remember  I had the phone-er.  Oh, Jimmy.  Don't feel bad, and don't beat yourself up about it.  Don't at all.  It's...  Everything's okay.  I'm not going to do it.  I'm on the air here.  I'm not going to do it.  Everything's okay.  We'll all still be friends after.  Yeah.  We should simulcast it.  It's my fault.  No, it's not.  Of course it is, Kenny.  I should have remembered to do it.  No, no.  I should have remembered first.  It's nobody's fault, really.  Sam, stay out of it.  Oh, you're right.  Shit.  I was shit-stirring again.  He really fucking told you there.  That was scary. 
[02:02:00]  I was watching a program last night.  I got caught up in this dumb show that we actually did some reads for.  I actually did some reads for this program, and I got caught up in it, because they did  those marathons.  You know, when you're watching these fucking shows?  Sure.  And then you get kind of caught up in one, but you don't really care.  You could change the channel or something, and then right away, they put the next one  on, and you're like, eh, maybe I'll just watch this and see what happens, because they  kind of left it off at the end.  Well, it's on.  They do a little teaser.  Yeah. 
[02:02:30]  So now you watch another one.  Once you watch two in a row, you're in.  You're in.  Now you're doing a marathon.  So, yeah.  So I watched all the episodes, and then the live episode that was on last night at 10,  and I watched it.  And it doesn't sound like a show I would like, and I don't have anything of interest.  interest in the subject matter.  What show is this?  I'm sorry.  It is called Ink Master. 
[02:03:00]  Ink Master.  The tattoo show.  The tattoo show.  And there was a live one.  It wasn't live last night.  It was new.  It was new.  Yeah.  Dave Navarro.  Okay.  And then two tattoo guys.  Yeah.  Two tattoo guys.  Chris Nunez.  Is it Chris Nunez and some other guy?  And I remember doing reads for this.  But I got caught up in it.  I didn't think I would want to watch it.  Because it's horrifying to watch, by the way.  Why?  Because they give people these challenges. 
[02:03:30]  These tattoo challenges.  And they have to do certain types of tattoos that might not be in their wheelhouse.  Yeah.  On people.  Well, that was the show.  I hate to bring up the Barclays again, but we were just talking about it.  That was the show that was at the Barclays Center at the Jay-Z concert giving people Brooklyn  Nets tattoos.  Real tattoos.  Real tattoos.  And you just got online for free, but you picked one or the other Brooklyn Nets tattoos  before the season had started.  Yeah.  What were the tattoo options? 
[02:04:00]  Two different Brooklyn Nets logos.  Oh, just both logos.  Okay.  But that was the show that was doing it.  It must have been the contestants trying to knock out as many Nets logos as they could.  Maybe.  Yeah, that's who you wanted to do it.  A contestant on a fucking reality show.  Exactly.  Exactly it.  Like, you're getting tattooed, which is, for the most part, permanent.  I mean, there's types of removals, but they never really remove it very nicely.  There's cover-ups, but, you know, still.  You're going to walk around with a tattoo that might suck. 
[02:04:30]  And you're getting it from somebody that might not be that good, that's trying to win a contest.  So, they had, last night, the live episode was probably the hardest of all tattoos, the portrait.  Oh, I have a clip.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  All right.  Play a little clip.  Did you know Jeff Hardy had been a guest on this show?  Jeff Hardy was on it.  No, I didn't.  I remember when Jeff Hardy was in WWE and people talked about it.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, Jeff Hardy was on.  He was getting a tattoo.  But, uh, this would be, uh, Ink Masters, they were doing portraits, and they had this guy, this portrait expert. 
[02:05:00]  I don't know what his name is, but, fuck, they showed some of his stuff.  Oliver Peck?  Oh, it could be him.  Kat Von D's ex.  Ah.  Really?  Look at you with the information.  He, fucking, they showed some of his shit.  It looked like, like black and white photographs of people.  When you, when, when it's done right, it, it looks amazing.  And when it's done wrong, there's nothing worse.  When it's done wrong, you end up on, fucking, absolute tattoo fail, uh, uh, websites. 
[02:05:30]  Like the awful baby portraits?  Ugh.  A portrait, a bad portrait tattoo is the worst type of bad tattoo there is.  It's gotta be.  Anything else could be like, well, this was this, this is that.  Because it's supposed to look like somebody.  Yeah, you know what the intention was going in.  Yes, exactly.  So you know you're, like, everybody knows you're an asshole.  Yeah.  Oh my.  What, what, what site is that?  This is just Google.  Bad portrait tattoos.  Let's see.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:06:00]  Let's see.  Hang on.  It looks like a troll.  Make it bigger.  Oh my God.  That's yeah.  You don't think that's a good one?  Wow.  That looks like a fucking monster.  What?  Oh my God.  I mean, the worst of worst portrait tattoos is, of course.  The Sopranos.  Oh, the Sopranos on Eastside Day.  This is the most famous one.  Oh, yeah.  That's the one with the, in loving memory of the guy's sister, I guess it was, or something.  The giant gaps in the teeth.  It's very difficult to do teeth. 
[02:06:30]  That is so fucking bad.  She looks like a fucking, a dead, a dead person.  Now, why are they holding the picture up?  To show how good it is?  Yeah, to be like, hey, look at this photo that I've turned into a tattoo.  It's terrible.  The head is uneven with the fucking, like the hair is on a different angle than the head.  Dude, it's so fucking bad.  You're right.  The hair is.  Because the hairline doesn't even out with the face whatsoever.  There's no real dimension to it.  And then there are guys in prison that could fucking, are amazing tattoo artists. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, then there's.  That's so bad.  Holy shit.  Oh, here's the good one.  Then there's shit like, look at this.  Well, who would get that on?  Yeah, but I mean, still.  It looks amazing.  And Jack Black?  Yeah.  That's a great tattoo.  That looks fucking amazing.  How do they do that shit?  It's on skin for the love of God.  Yeah, Marilyn Monroe, Willie Nelson.  Those are fucking amazing.  Will Ferrell and Elf. 
[02:07:30]  So here's, you know, we saw a baby one.  Yeah, yeah.  Now that looks like a photo of a baby put on someone's foot.  That's like a Norman Rockwell painting.  That's crazy.  Wow.  Yeah, well, last night on Ink Master.  Ink Master.  To find out who's going to be the Ink Master.  And win $100,000.  And the title of Ink Master.  They had him do portraits.  And some of these people, like this one guy, his style is new school.  He's new school. 
[02:08:00]  What's new school tattooing?  I don't know.  It looks like graffiti art, pretty much.  Street art.  Street art.  It's the new school.  He does bulgy eyes and buck teeth, kind of animal things.  Did you like the show?  Yeah.  I think you did.  I thought it was pretty fucking good.  Tell you the truth.  Tattoo reality shows are usually pretty good.  Pretty interesting.  And I like the fact that it's real people getting these done, because some of them are like,  oh, God.  Like, pissed off.  Some people don't like the end result.  It's a real tattoo going on these fucking people.  What are you going to do?  If it sucks, you're fucked. 
[02:08:30]  You're fucked.  So, and portraits, very difficult.  So, the one guy that did the new school kind of tats, he was saying, like, I don't really  do portraits.  And he fucked this up so bad.  On somebody's back or?  On somebody's leg or whatever the fuck it was.  That's the guy that does, like, the good fucking portraits.  We still talk about her like she's in the night room.  That's how much she makes at a family.  Throughout the competition, Steve has consistently shown that he is a precise and detailed tattooer. 
[02:09:00]  Wow.  And this portrait is another great example of this.  Damn.  That's not bad, right?  That's great.  Yeah.  But Sarah really had a beat with a portrait of her canvas' son.  That's amazing.  Yeah, she did a good job.  The detail in the shirt and the shading in the face.  The kid.  And a plaid shirt looking like it's all wrinkly and stuff.  Wow.  Very good.  Except what you did.  Move on and never do it again.  A couple things to keep in mind when placing your vote takes expert precision.  Is that Floyd Patterson? 
[02:09:30]  I don't know.  That was the guy's father.  That's the terrible one.  She's, like, black.  And her eye is all fucked up.  He made her black.  Wow.  Shadowing makes a face look fucked up.  Yes, yes.  Now pass your votes at inkmaster.spike.com.  Inkmaster.  Yeah, it was pretty fucking cool.  But that one guy, like, made it way too dark.  Some of them, you look and go, like, what are they doing?  It's like black blob on there.  Yeah, it's weird.  Like, they fuck it up.  But I was pretty... 
[02:10:00]  I got roped in.  Dave Navarro's pretty good hosting it.  You know?  Don't they have white...  Like, black people get tattoos and it's hard to see.  Like, can't you tattoo white?  Like, Sam's t-shirt white.  I hear that's very difficult.  White pigment.  I think it is difficult.  I think some doesn't work.  Like, with white people, you can leave the white of the skin...  Right.  ...in it to give it that highlight area.  Like, for glare on the nose or forehead or something.  But black people, very difficult.  And they do these small challenges, of course. 
[02:10:30]  It's the same formula as a lot of the reality shows.  But they do these small challenges first to decide who gets to appoint the tattoo artist with the person.  And what they want.  So, if the guy won the challenge and he wants to fuck over another guy, he always gives him a black guy.  Because they're hard to fucking tattoo.  And they go, like, oh, another wolf on dark skin.  They just say, oh, it's harder working with dark skin.  It's like, oh, black guy.  Yeah.  It is.  Are there any black guys in this? 
[02:11:00]  Like, as...  Yes, as the artist.  Yeah.  Or have it as people that they're doing the art on?  Oh, yep.  Yep.  Okay.  Yeah.  The light ink, too, tends to...  It fades away.  Yeah.  The lighter ink.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Over time.  Oh, okay.  Let me see here.  Yeah.  What are good tattoos on black people?  Like, because you can never just...  Black people get a lot of, like, fucking...  They look gang-y.  That's why they have those raised tattoos.  A lot of tribal, too.  That's why black...  Wiz.  They have the, uh...  Oh, like a brand or something.  A scarring.  Look up Lil Wayne.  He's got...  Lil Wayne.  Oh, no.  Gucci mane right there. 
[02:11:30]  Scroll.  Holy shit.  Oh, that actually looks okay.  You know what it is?  The dark...  There's a lot of dark ink.  Yeah, that has to be.  Yeah, they're getting better with the very dark ink.  Which makes...  Okay, that actually looks...  Holy shit.  Scroll down to...  Scroll to Gucci in the orange shirt right there.  Oh, Gucci.  Over to the left.  Up.  Up.  Right there.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck, dude?  He got a triple scoop ice cream cone on it.  With a lightning bolt.  On his face.  It's a tattoo.  On his face, a triple scoop ice cream with a lightning bolt.  Oh, that's nice. 
[02:12:00]  Why would you do that?  He likes ice cream and lightning.  It's Gucci.  Oh, that makes perfect sense.  Was that Rodman?  Mm-hmm.  A lot of tribal, too.  Black guys seem to get a lot of tribal art.  Yeah.  Wiz Khalifa is covered in tattoos.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  Your friend?  Yeah, I met him.  It was very nice.  I, um...  Yeah, I enjoyed the program.  I guess the finale is, like, next week or something.  Maybe the week after.  I've kind of gotten attracted to women with tattoos.  Like, I've never been big.  But I think it's kind of sexy when a girl's all fucking...  Yeah, there's something like...  It's a slutty tattoo. 
[02:12:30]  Rick Ross has tattoos all over his stomach.  Yep.  His big, fat stomach.  I kind of like that he doesn't care that he's a big, fucking fat dude.  Dude, that is something.  Because I never really was into girls with tats or anything.  But it can be hot, right?  And then all of a sudden, I'm like, yeah, that's kind of fucking something about that.  Yeah, I like that.  Kind of shock shirt.  Kind of shock shirt.  Do you think...  Does Rick always not wear a shirt?  He frequently doesn't wear a shirt.  He takes his shirt off in concerts and everything.  He doesn't care?  He doesn't give a fuck.  He's a boss.  Is he the one that got...  The boss?  What's that?  That's what he calls himself. 
[02:13:00]  The boss?  The boss.  What's that mean?  Bows?  He's a boss.  But he says it like that.  I'm the boss.  I'm the boss.  Is he the boss?  Yeah, he's Rick Ross.  Springsteen was.  But is he...  He was the corrections officer, right?  Yeah, I mean, 50 didn't touch him.  What did he?  Like, with the shit that 50 was saying, like, he really didn't affect his career.  If anything, it made him bigger.  It did.  Isn't this the guy that just recently had, like, some threats against him?  Yep.  The gang members.  Right, because he put some shit in his tune or something.  Mm-hmm.  And is he worried about the gang members? 
[02:13:30]  Apparently he was.  He canceled his tour.  Canceled his fucking tour.  But then he went on a radio show and said it was like, I wanted to teach the tour manager  a blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm not afraid of anybody, blah, blah, blah.  But he canceled his tour because this gang put out a video talking about Rick Ross saying,  you know, you're supposed to cut that check.  You got to cut that check.  And everybody in the background is just pulling triggers with their fingers.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  Where can I find that, Sam?  If you just look up Rick Ross gang threats.  He canceled an entire tour? 
[02:14:00]  Black people be crazy.  Second half of the tour, yeah.  Black people be crazy.  Why would they do that?  Well, you know what?  The mob doesn't do that on YouTube.  No.  But that was how the mob got shit done.  It was that threat.  And I guess if Biggie and Tupac can be killed, any rapper probably realizes it doesn't matter  how fucking guarded you are.  They shot into a car with Suge Knight.  Yes.  It's those guys, Travis, if it helps.  The image is the one with the bandanas.  If history has taught us anything.  Is this it? 
[02:14:30]  It's that gang.  What gang is it?  Alabama gangster disciples?  Are they Crips of Bloods?  What kind of gang has a Jewish star, Star David?  Gangster disciples.  Gangster or gangster?  I don't know.  I'm not going to say one word about them.  I have no idea.  Oh, I see what you're doing here.  I will remain.  All I know is the videos I've seen on the internet.  I'm firmly behind them on this one.  You're siding with that?  What did Rick Ross?  He didn't say anything bad about them.  I guess what was it?  It's a money issue?  I don't really know.  I think it's a money issue.  And I think he said something about them in a song or something. 
[02:15:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  This is shit.  This straight at Rick Ross, the whole Maybach music is fucking real talk.  Holy shit.  The whole public service announcement is about this.  Look.  First of all, let me get it straight.  Larry Hoover don't have nothing to do with this.  So before y'all take the tape back and try to put LJ and his daddy in it, they don't  have nothing to do with this right here.  This G's coming from all over talking about this right here.  This shit's real.  Straight up.  You know what you did first time we gave you a pass on the Larry Hoover Big Me song. 
[02:15:30]  You were supposed to take care of some business you didn't take care of.  You know who you need to tune in to.  Now, you don't really disrespect the organization by putting your face on.  You're going to put your face in this star right here.  You see that right there?  It ain't nothing but three people that rocked this star.  The Jews, GD, Illuminati.  GD, FOLK.  GD, FOLK.  You're not GD.  Oh, man.  Holy shit.  Are you scared? 
[02:16:00]  Yes.  D-Site, FOLK.  D-Site, FOLK.  Fag-ass nigga.  That's like this.  Fag-ass nigga.  We pulling up on you.  We pressing up on you the whole Maybach.  It don't matter.  It don't matter.  Rich Voss better watch out with that tattoo.  He's talking about the star of David.  G-O.  D-Site, FOLK.  D-Site, FOLK.  That one guy looks white.  Don't say that shit.  This is my worst nightmare.  Look, he's making a fucking trigger-pulling motion. 
[02:16:30]  You're not even sure what they're saying?  Just tell me what you want.  You can have it.  You see what I'm saying?  You see that right here?  Wow.  This ain't even a penny on the ball.  Oh, my God.  Can you pause this real quick?  What was happening was this one guy.  Holy shit.  One guy who does not look like he's fucking playing games.  No.  And he was just showing his face, and he was the guy talking,  and behind him was a bunch of guys with the bandanas over their faces. 
[02:17:00]  Blue bandanas over their faces.  And they were blue, so I'm going to assume.  Are they Crips?  No, they're disciples.  But is that a piece of, is that an offshoot of Crips?  I'm not aware of.  I don't know for sure.  But those guys, I guess there's some, he said,  we gave you a pass on something.  Oh, my God.  And I don't know, I couldn't decipher.  They were talking about something that obviously Rick Ross understands.  Oh, yes, he does.  And they said something about promoters in there.  I wonder if the tour was canceled by the promoters.  Like, because it said something about the promoter, 
[02:17:30]  and then the two of the guys are making the pull,  like, Sansa, the pull trigger fingers.  We're pressing up on you, yo.  We're pressing up on you.  You know why that doesn't scare me?  Why?  Because they would never have any dealings with what I'm doing.  Well, that's true.  That's so not my, this, you know, it's never going to be,  yo, Jim, that joke you did about getting tinkled on.  Like, it's never, I'm never going to cross paths with those guys.  Jim, no, we're pressing up on you.  And they didn't like Rick Ross putting his face in the Star of David.  Now, why did he do that?  Why did he do that?  Yeah.  There's a thing with Judaism in rap lately. 
[02:18:00]  They like it or hate it?  Which is wacky.  They kind of like it.  Like, I think it's because they look at Jewish people,  it's like a very powerful group of people,  like a lot of rich people.  Well, so they're agents in music.  Every fucking agent.  That's true.  And so, like, like Jay-Z put out,  I think the first, when I first started noticing it,  it was like Jay-Z and P. Diddy started saying like Laha'em  and Mazel Tov a lot, like four or five years ago.  But is it Jews or is it that they're embracing black Israelites?  And I don't know. 
[02:18:30]  I don't know what those guys are doing.  Right.  I know that rappers started embracing Jews  and then Star of David started popping up.  I know they used the Star of David.  I don't know if it's black Israelites.  Why are you bashing JD like this?  Yeah.  Why are you fucking disrespecting gangster disciples?  I would never do that.  That guy was fucking...  I would never do that.  Do you know how entertaining it would be to just talk to that guy for a while?  Dude.  And fuck it.  Because that's a guy who does not fucking play games.  You want us to book the gangster disciples?  Oh, yeah.  You know what's amazing?  I would actually love to talk because they have no dealings with us.  You know what's amazing? 
[02:19:00]  You watch movies and you watch like gang bangers and fucking gang leaders and whatnot in a movie.  They can never capture what that guy has.  There's something there.  They could get close.  They could be convincing.  That shit right there is so real.  You can't look at that and go, oh, that guy's just an actor.  I'll tell you what's frightening about that guy is that he's not...  You can see when somebody's playing tough and he's not doing something to be scary. 
[02:19:30]  What he's saying is genuine.  He's telling this guy, this is exactly where we're at.  He's conveying a message.  He's conveying a message.  And the fucking scary part is in that you know that he means what he's saying.  Oh, yeah.  And he's backed up with those fucking, as Marcellus Wallace said, pipe-hitting niggas.  Yeah.  Those guys behind him don't play games either.  No.  And he's also got nothing.  I don't know who he is or what his relationship to Rick Ross is.  That's a scary world.  If you are... 
[02:20:00]  Man, I guess if you cross anybody, it's probably like crossing the mob.  It's like you just know that somebody will come after you.  I told you what Who Kid said.  He put out a mixtape and Big Pond ended up kidnapping him and putting an Uzi to his head.  Crazy.  You know?  And that's Who Kid.  Who Kid's a pussy.  Unbelievable.  Why as a fucking...  Why as a rapper, would you say shit in a song that fucks with other guys like that?  There's still part of rap.  There's still a huge part of it that people really not only feel like they have to be tough. 
[02:20:30]  The audience is like...  They can't let their audience see them as not being tough.  They have to be gangsters themselves.  But being a gangster is one thing.  But can't you be a gangster?  Eminem was smart.  Because Eminem fucking bashed Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, the fucking Backstreet Boys, Moby, New Kids on the Block.  Suck a lot.  What, are they going to beat him up?  Yeah, exactly.  But he never went after black targets. 
[02:21:00]  No, no.  And not even tough white ones.  But a black, I can't get away with that.  Probably not.  Rick Ross couldn't get on and make fun of One Direction and have hip-hop take him seriously.  But could he just...  Does Jay-Z attack people in his songs?  He did at a point, but he stopped because he's bigger than all of them.  But can Rick Ross stop...  Does he have to attack people in his songs to be tough and...  He doesn't have to, but that's how he's made his reputation.  I mean, he named himself after a drug dealer.  I bet he's thinking twice about that now. 
[02:21:30]  Does he attack 50 Cent?  Fuck.  He has.  He doesn't anymore.  I don't think that beef is still active.  Are they friends now?  No.  How does a beef get squashed?  Is it like...  Well, it's not squashed.  It just hasn't been...  I just want squashing beef.  Aren't you curious, though?  Like, what happens in this world?  Remember the fight at the BET Awards we were talking about on the air?  Yeah.  That was Rick Ross' group.  And there was G-Unit people involved in that, too.  Which is 50 Cent's group.  So it's still there.  It's just they're not actively putting out, like, you know, records against each other.  Oh, that's fucked up.  Did that whole thing make 50 Cent look bad? 
[02:22:00]  In the sense that he didn't ruin the guy he set out to ruin?  It didn't really make him look bad because he is not a big player in rap music.  He is in the sense that he's like...  He put out the album and he's put out songs that are like...  Will forever be known as like...  These are great songs.  He's made tons of money and everything.  But he's not like an active guy.  Like, when he puts out a single, he'll put it out.  But he's more like a businessman.  He's like a mogul, kind of.  Right.  Did he disappear on purpose?  Yeah, I mean, he's... 
[02:22:30]  Like, I'm good.  Yeah.  He's more of a businessman now.  It's almost like once you make 50 or 100 million, is it hard to just all of a sudden  keep saying shit that you know is eventually going to get you shot?  Right, right.  Right.  So he doesn't do as much of the nonsense because, you know, he's a multi, multi, multi-millionaire.  Does Rick Ross have a lot of guys around him?  Yeah.  He has a big group?  Oh, he must.  Huge group.  How many guys do you think he travels with?  30?  40?  Yeah, I mean, he travels.  These guys travel with these huge entourages. 
[02:23:00]  They got their fucking boys, yo.  I guess that's why.  Yeah.  Because a lot of the award shows, you can't bring guns in.  They've won you.  So it's like, yes, you have to have a big group with you.  Yeah.  How many tickets do you think Rick Ross needs when he goes to an event?  Probably quite a few.  You think it's a problem for him?  Especially since now they all have record labels.  All these rappers.  Like, the thing is to not be a rapper, but everybody has to have their own record label.  I'm a producer.  So Rick Ross has him, his entourage, and then all of his rappers that are on his label  Because he wants to push them.  Are traveling with him, and they all have mini entourages because they're trying to be stars, too. 
[02:23:30]  So there's just these giant, massive groups of people.  But these guys do make a lot of money, too.  It sounds like it's crazy, but they fucking make a lot of cash.  Yeah.  It's so fucking alien to me.  Yeah.  That world is fucking like it might as well be in outer space.  But you wouldn't want to talk to, like, here's why.  Because you have no issues with him.  Right.  Like, they're not going to come after you.  They don't.  You know what?  I don't.  Nah.  It was like we had that guy, RZA, in, or I would love to talk to that other guy for the 
[02:24:00]  Wu-Tang.  Because we have no issues with them.  There's no...  By the way, who could said Raekwon will do the show?  I would love to talk to him.  Might want to rob me.  Nah.  They might want to rob me.  He's not going to rob you on a radio show.  Like, it's a serious exam.  Really?  Those guys fucking...  They want to rob me?  No.  When those guys, the amount of business, the guys that are drug dealers, they make a lot  of fucking money, man.  They don't want to rob me?  They're not going to rob you on the radio show.  You have a gun, too.  Yeah.  They love you.  I always say this, how ant and fucking rappers, it's fucking one degree of separation. 
[02:24:30]  You're Sicilian, which we all have so seen.  The boars.  You have guns.  You like fucking broads.  You have a pool that you always want chicks in.  You fucking drive a fast car.  You're gaudy.  You just don't wear jewelry, but you're exactly like fucking rappers.  My jury.  I need some jury, yo.  They would love you.  Do you want to talk to somebody who knows more about the beef?  Yeah, I would love to.  Nathan from Chicago.  Nathan.  They call Chicago something different on some of the websites.  I'm sure they do, yes. 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  Yes, Chicagoland.  Hello, Nathan.  Hey, the reason Rick Ross has beef with the folk nation is they mention Larry Hoover,  one of his songs.  Who's Larry Hoover?  Larry Hoover was the founder of the Disciples.  Okay.  Way back in the day.  Um, that's the reason they took it very disrespectful that they would mention Larry Hoover.  The five-point star comes from the star, David.  Now, you have differences.  Six.  Yeah, it is six. 
[02:25:30]  Some games will run under the five.  You're trying this.  Yeah.  Six-point star.  Wait, let me ask you about the thing with Larry Hoover.  Um, now, is he alive or dead?  As far as I can remember, he's alive.  He's in the federal prison here in Illinois.  Oh, okay.  Surprised.  Yeah, so he's still, uh, he's still, I'm looking at a picture of him.  He's 62 now.  Yeah.  He looks like, he looks like another guy that doesn't fuck around.  Mm-hmm.  I'm looking at his face now.  I don't know where he is. 
[02:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  Is that him right there?  Wow, yeah.  Okay.  He looks like a guy that doesn't fuck around.  Like I said, he's, as far as I know, he's still in the Juliet State, a federal prison.  But, uh...  Did Rick Ross say anything bad about him, or was it something good?  No, I just mentioned, in one of his songs, I can't remember which one of it is, he goes  Larry Hoover, and he just keeps mentioning the name.  Oh, man.  Oh, okay.  You don't even mention his name, yo.  Well, it might have been shitty, though.  Yeah, it might have been.  I, I, even gangs don't get mad if you fucking praise them, do they?  No, I don't think so, but I don't know.  Like I said, it's alien to me. 
[02:26:30]  But with Rick Ross is, Rick Ross is a fake, considered.  Oh.  No, he's not really real.  He hasn't come from the life, and you're gonna mention Larry Hoover's name.  That's very disrespectful.  Oh, is that what it is?  That they see him as kind of a guy, like, who's, uh...  Well, he definitely portrays himself as like a gangster.  I mean, the whole The Boss thing is, you know, a mafia reference.  The Bouse.  The Bouse.  Very good.  But, but he's not, you know, he's not even a gangster, he's a rapper. 
[02:27:00]  I mean, he took a drug dealer's name, you know, he's not real.  You know, so when you mention Larry Hoover's name, it's disrespectful.  I'm no longer in that life.  I ran with the Disciples for a long time.  I don't run with them anymore.  You did, sir?  Where were you running?  What?  Honestly, not to be a...  Are you a white guy or a black guy?  I'm a white guy.  Okay, so what did you do?  You sound like a white guy.  What did you do with the gang?  I, you know, dealt with the dealings, you know.  Oh, okay.  You weren't a gang member, but you had dealings with them. 
[02:27:30]  I was basically as close as a white boy to get into the gang.  Well, if there's a white boy...  This is what you're saying.  If there's a white boy running with a gang, I'm thinking, because only white people really  know how to make crystal meth.  Yeah, that or you're a lawyer.  Yeah, you're a meth dealer or a lawyer.  Oh, so maybe it was that he mentioned him, but just...  Oh, I see.  Maybe he mentioned him and they didn't fucking care for it.  Yeah, you just don't mention Larry Hoover's name.  Oh. 
[02:28:00]  I wouldn't either.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm reading something here.  It said, thank you for the call, buddy.  Rappers say a lot of things, and it says sometimes a lyric can inspire outrage.  Such was the case recently when Rick Ross imagined himself to be Big Meech and Larry Hoover in  Blowing Money Fast.  It's a new single from his album, Teflon.  While many listeners see it as purely a good line or another example of hip-hop's fascination  with gangster culture, others took the comments to heart in a way that few could understand.  Oh, boy. 
[02:28:30]  While Big Meech and Larry Hoover exist in name only to the majority of hip-hop consumers,  the two figures are friends, fathers, associates, and leaders to select groups of people, and  for them, Ross's word had a direct impact.  Oh, man.  It says Rick Ross's reference to Larry Hoover took on a new life when he visited Chicago.  For those unfamiliar, Chicago, whatever, which is where I guess Larry Hoover is from.  So he probably portrayed himself as Larry Hoover in a rap song.  Maybe he was saying, like, you know, I'm this. 
[02:29:00]  It's like saying, you know, I'm...  But that's what he does.  Like, you know, his name's Rick Ross.  That's not his name.  That's the name of a drug dealer.  Ah.  Like, Freeway Ricky Ross was, like, a very famous...  So he took the name of a drug dealer.  Yeah.  I mean, to the point where I think Joe Rogan had the real Rick Ross on his podcast, Freeway  Rick Ross, and we ran that on the channel.  And I forgot, because I heard it on the air, so that's why it never came up.  But whoever wrote the promo wrote on this week's Joe Rogan podcast, rapper Rick Ross.  Oh, and it wasn't a drug dealer. 
[02:29:30]  No, it was the actual Rick Ross.  Freeway.  Why would he do that?  Why does he take people's names?  Silly.  Well, they said...  He's very famous, Freeway Rick Ross.  They're saying that people sought him out and explained why they didn't like the reference.  It's not for the reasons I thought.  Oh, what is it?  Hoover is very remorseful for the things that he's done, as well as things he's done through  the street organization.  A lot of that goes back to him, and we're trying to change that around and push peace instead  of negativity.  So that's why that guy or his son didn't like it. 
[02:30:00]  And maybe that...  Didn't he say something?  We gave you a pass on the first time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe that's what they're talking about.  Oh, and you know what?  And because later in the video, he says, talking about writing checks, they probably want money  from Rick Ross for using the name.  And saying, we want money from that song.  They're extorting him.  We gave you a pass.  Hilarious.  Meaning we didn't hurt you, but you were supposed to give us a check.  Okay.  Maybe that's what...  And Rick Ross probably hasn't paid what they want.  But even though this guy is not in the gang life anymore, the gang still respects him. 
[02:30:30]  Right.  I'm sure he's not having them do that, but they know that he's upset by it.  Okay.  And they're seeking vengeance.  It's like a film.  You know who will protect him if he wants?  That's very interesting.  Eat rock on me, nigga.  That's right.  That's what I think.  Coke floats in my cup.  Coke floats in my cup.  That's a scary world to fuck around with.  Especially when you're saying something you think is good, and then it gives you a problem.  Well, maybe that's what he does.  Like, he must...  Obviously, he just does a lot of reading and documentary watching about, you know, gang 
[02:31:00]  leaders and stuff.  And he finds, like, Rick Ross is obviously...  He was in jail, or, you know, he's out of jail now, obviously, but he's completely retired.  And Full 50 Cent took his name from another guy.  And Larry Hoover's retired, and so he's mentioning all these, like, old gang leaders probably thinking  that they're way out of the game, so he's fine, not realizing that there's a whole  active gang that doesn't want you to say that.  But also, um, oh, what was I going to say?  Oh, they said that those names don't mean much to, like, hip-hop.  Like, people who are just fans of the music don't know who these guys are, but there are 
[02:31:30]  real people that do know them, and that's...  Wow, all right.  Or they're just, like, icon.  Like, you know what I mean?  Just fucking rap about something else.  That's such an easy place to step in the wrong fucking toes.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's what hip-hop likes.  I mean, that's where they all love Goodfellas.  They all love Scarface.  They all love all these gang stories.  I was thinking of the guy taking the name Gotti, also.  That's fucking, you know.  Gotti.  Have we said anything today?  Watch me get a fucking threat now, because I've mentioned the name in the...  Oh, no, Jimmy.  You don't need it.  I don't need the hassle.  You don't need that shit.  I'm just a sweet boy. 
[02:32:00]  You're just a sweet white boy who doesn't know what he's doing.  Please.  Leave Jimmy alone.  Leave him alone!  I don't think you get in trouble for mentioning the problems.  Yeah.  Do you?  No.  I mean, if you just describe...  Especially if you're like a high-profile white radio show that doesn't...  Or this one.  That doesn't understand what's going on and is just talking about this.  Yeah.  I mean, I would assume the gang would enjoy the fact that this is coming to light.  Probably.  As long as you're not sitting there and, you know...  Taking sides?  As long as we're cutting checks.  Right. 
[02:32:30]  Telling Rick Rouse, cut that check.  That fucking guy, though.  That guy was...  Well, Rick Rouse, cut that check.  I would cut the check if I was him.  That's scary.  Fucking talk.  Would you not want to see your name?  Yo, Jim Norton.  Oh, no.  Cut that check.  Imagine watching that video and they're talking about you.  Yeah.  I would just be like, oh, my God.  I got to leave the fucking earth.  But, like, I did a reference to something.  Like, I made fun of a movie that one of these guys produced that they thought was really good.  I'm shitting on it like a fucking idiot that I am.  Oh, no.  That would be terrible.  Yeah.  Yo, man.  Derek Jeter didn't sign that picture.  Sorry I said anything. 
[02:33:00]  It's probably because I'm outside of that world completely.  But, like, when I met Rick Rouse up here.  Yeah.  And he really does have not only, like, the physical size, but he's charming and intimidating like he is a mafia boss.  Really?  You get there.  And it's like he just sits back and he's this huge dude.  And he's, like, pretty quick and funny.  But he's also very underspoken and, like, you feel like he's in charge of some kind of...  Like he's comfortable being the main event.  He's comfortable with the attention.  And he's comfortable with, like, doing what needs to be done. 
[02:33:30]  Like a mafia boss.  For liking the mafia so much and that whole world, they really don't know how it operated during its heyday.  Because it was really quiet.  You mean not being so braggadocious?  Yeah.  They didn't sing about it?  No.  You didn't see, like, Sinatra and Tony Bennett going, I'm gonna put a cap in your ass, you weak motherfucker.  They kind of kept it under their hats.  Right.  You screwed me on the money.  He's fucking singing about, like, shit that went bad. 
[02:34:00]  But if Rick Ross was a corrections officer, those guys are usually fairly tough because they have no guns and they're dealing with convicts.  And I'm sure a lot of them are very tough guys.  Yeah.  I'm sure that Rick Ross could easily kick the shit out of anyone in here.  Well, that's the one who couldn't.  Yeah.  I know, right?  You picked a real fucking rugged room.  You picked a really tough room.  Who else could he beat up?  The fucking, the Elmo puppeteer?  Pick tougher targets.  He's just a big dude.  He's probably, you know, I don't think you can be a total pussy and be a correction officer for long.  No, I don't think so. 
[02:34:30]  How long was he?  Can we look that up?  Sure we can.  I'm starting my new show at 10 o'clock is about rap.  No, it's an advice show, Jimmy Norton.  It's hip-hop world.  The Jim Norton show.  Jim Norton knows nothing about hip-hop.  And it premieres, premieres at 10 o'clock, right after this very program.  Who do you think, Sam, let me ask you this.  Who?  Who?  Who do you think is the most genuine thug in rap?  Like, the most real, like, this guy's, not necessarily the toughest, but this guy's absolutely the most real thug that I can think of. 
[02:35:00]  It's our rule.  I mean, I don't know.  It would probably be, like, some of the Wu-Tang guys that you don't really hear about.  Like, because once they get a certain level of fame, they're not, like, thugs anymore.  You can't have that life.  But I mean, who's from, I guess they're all from this world in some way, right?  Yeah, I mean, most of them legitimately start out in projects and hustling drugs and stuff like that.  A lot of them do.  I wish Who Kid was here now, because I'd love to ask him about that video.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  I'd love to get his opinion on it. 
[02:35:30]  He probably knows some inside info on all this shit.  Well, yeah, he's got to keep up with what's going on.  If he doesn't know.  You don't think he'd badmouth those guys, do you?  No, he'd badmouth Rick Ross.  Oh, that's right.  They don't like each other, right?  He did a whole, like, that's the whole reason I'm friends with Who Kid.  Wasn't Rick Ross in there?  No.  On Shade?  Maybe he's been on, no, probably not.  Where'd you meet him?  What was he doing up here?  Hip Hop Nation.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, because when I did that interview with him, that's the whole reason I became friends  with Who Kid, because he wanted me to come on his show and then play the interview.  But he did, like, he does a seven-hour show, Who Kid, on Saturdays with music and everything. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, okay.  He once spent an entire seven-hour show shitting on Rick Ross.  Wow.  Like, that's...  Why?  Because that's when Rick Ross and 50 Cent were having their beef, and Who Kid is...  He's a fitted guy.  Yeah.  He's 50s DJ.  Yeah.  All right.  But then he called me after the seven-hour shitting session and said,  Yo, man, you were funny, but I gotta stop having you on for a little while,  because we gotta leave him alone for a little bit. 
[02:36:30]  We gotta leave Rick Ross alone for a little bit.  Oh, no.  Like, I'm really pushing it now.  I don't need to be kidnapped and...  No shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's so nice to not be involved and have to worry.  Like, so nice to not have to worry about that shit.  You end up like that fucking guy that was texting.  Walking down the street.  Just get a bullet in your fucking head.  I think you really have to fuck up for that to happen.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, like, but Hot 97, like, it's all safe.  Like, Hot 97, their morning show guy is a buddy of mine, but he's, like, a white Jewish guy.  And, like, he shits on Nicki Minaj, but it's like... 
[02:37:00]  Who cares?  Who cares?  Exactly.  She's pop culture.  Exactly.  Nicki Minaj is not seen as a gangster.  No way.  No.  She's a chick from Queens, right?  Right.  I mean, you know, she's on Lil Wayne's record label, but Lil Wayne's been famous forever, too.  Yeah, she's got...  I'd fuck Nicki Minaj.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She comes off as very non-sexual these days.  She does, yeah.  Weird.  I just want to lick your penis.  Weird fucking...  She used to be really sexual.  Well, she's fucking...  When you get 80 million hits on YouTube, it's probably hard to be dirty anymore. 
[02:37:30]  She looks stinky.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, no, not at all.  I bet her vagina smelly.  After anyone dancing for a while is gonna have a fucking stinky box.  She used to be like Lil' Kim dirty.  Like, she was just talking about fucking all the time.  Really?  What happened to Lil' Kim?  She just fell off.  She talked about fucking all the time.  I liked her.  Maybe that's what it is.  Yeah, Kim.  You know what?  You can't hit that mainstream level and talk about that.  You can't, and maybe that's what it is.  It's like, that's maybe her undoing.  Like, when her album, when Nicki Minaj's album came out, a lot of people were like, what 
[02:38:00]  the fuck is this?  Because it didn't send anything like the mixtapes that people like, but then she got on, you  know, Z100 and all those places because of the album.  I gotta piss.  How many followers on Twitter?  Lil' Kim.  Lil' Kim has 670,000.  670,000.  Oh, that's a lot, all right.  She's verified.  What are you doing, Marshall?  I'm verified, too, by the way.  Yes, you are.  Thanks to Dana White.  Yes.  Well, thanks.  Verified.  How are you doing on your verification there, Sam Roberts?  I just say thanks for nothing, Dana White. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, shit.  Why should Dana help you?  How do you help him?  I brought you...  Who did Rory McDonald fight?  I brought you to the UFC thing.  I filmed that shit for you.  Yeah, Dana, why don't you help our pal, not Sam, out?  I heard the other day...  Helped you out with the gloves.  You did.  You were a good boy.  I heard the other day you're talking to the ladies.  And they're verified.  Jenny Hutt's verified.  Jenny Hutt.  Nicole from the mashup is verified.  And Nicole, right.  Good.  If I had some titties, I'd be verified.  There you go.  You rocked me verified?  I'm sorry. 
[02:39:00]  I'm sorry.  I just want to hug Eric.  Oh, that's great.  Almost a whole break.  If you could.  Yeah.  Fucking hug him and then give him cancer or something.  The Pepe Sinclair News Company presents  Personal Hygiene and You, A Beginner's Guide.  You know, as we move into the future,  personal hygiene is becoming more and more important to our daily lives.  Why, look.  There is Hollywood celebrity Jim Norton. 
[02:39:30]  Mr. Norton, what is the most important part of your daily hygiene regimen?  I like my own asshole to sparkle.  And sparkle it does.  How do you achieve such a sparkle, Mr. Norton?  This is how I wipe my ass.  Here's the toilet.  I put one foot up and I go like this.  I arch my asshole out and I fucking open the cheeks and I make sure that I get in there.  I put a finger all the way up in until it's fucking completely clean.  Even on those extra messy days?  If it looks like there's still more work to be done, then I'll do like a wet wipe or whatever  and I'll wrap it around my finger and push it almost up.  You never know when a massage therapist might have to get in there, you know? 
[02:40:00]  Why, here comes Teddy, the neighborhood scamp.  Hi, Teddy.  Do you clean your rectum?  Every day.  Why don't you show Jim how you do it?  Wait, you just, you just, you don't go in?  No, Mr. Norton.  I just wipe it like I thought I was supposed to.  Oh, no.  I gotta get in there because I like my asshole to feel clean.  When I was a kid, I didn't wipe good enough.  My asshole would get raw.  So I've learned.  Oh, I get it.  Thanks, Mr. Norton.  You're welcome, Teddy.  We've all learned a little something today. 
[02:40:30]  I like a nice, clean ass.  Makes me feel like a better person.  We couldn't agree more.  Tune in to our next personal hygiene lesson when we'll go over the schmegma removal process.  And remember, clean assholes for a better tomorrow.  I was just saying how schmegma is an awful word and somebody popped it up here on PalTalk like schmegma. 
[02:41:00]  You felt compelled to spell it, did you?  Oh, fuck nice.  Well, Mr. Speed.  Oh.  This is not Kiss's version, is it?  It's a new version.  What version is it?  This is not off rock and roll over.  No?  It said Kiss.  But it doesn't sound like the original.  This might be my favorite Kiss song.  No way. 
[02:41:30]  You say that about every Kiss song.  No, this one.  Really?  What's the chorus sound like?  This is a different version.  No, I got the kind of lovin' that you need.  The kind of lovin' that you so made. 
[02:42:00]  Is there a chorus?  Not really.  Is this it?  What's that?  This song's kind of lackluster, Jimmy.  I gotta be honest.  Fair enough.  Yeah, maybe it is.  I just, I like it.  But that's not the original version.  That's a jazzed-up version.  It says Digital Remix off the Kiss collection.  How do I know that?  All right, you can turn off.  Yeah, really.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I'm teasing, of course.  I know you like Kiss very much.  I was never a big Kiss fan.  No, no.  I do like some of, a couple of their hits. 
[02:42:30]  Rock and Roll All Night, Party Every Day.  I like that, but I've heard of you enough.  Beth, I've heard of you enough.  Did I mention Rock and Roll All Night, Party Every Day?  You mentioned it twice, Ant, which would imply there's not a lot of Kiss songs you like,  if you can only come up with two.  Oh, you're so perceptive.  What about Strutter?  Loved it.  I love Strutter.  Yeah?  You like Strutter?  Yeah.  Good.  That's probably my favorite Kiss riff.  Riff?  Yeah.  That's what the kids call it, right?  You're riffing.  The kids.  Yeah.  The kids. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  The live version.  Oh, yeah, this is pretty huge.  I could play this one on Guitar Hero.  No way.  Oh, Guitar Hero.  Yeah.  Not real guitar.  No, no, no.  Yeah, I gotcha.  I hear ya.  Yellow, green.  Ha!  Live yellow, green.  Does anyone play that anymore, by the way?  No.  The game is done.  They overdid it.  Just like everything else that eventually fails, they overdid it.  They did.  They put out game after game, and then Rock Band came out, and they felt like they had to become 
[02:43:30]  Rock Band, and then, you know.  Yeah.  When you overdo it, people don't, you can't saturate your own market.  Yeah.  That was it.  God, it was huge for a while.  It was the biggest thing in the world for like a year.  Yeah.  Well, you have to find the balance between saturating the market and making the money when you can.  It's not like Guitar Hero is at any point going to be a lifelong money-making venture.  Oh, no, I know.  Money-making venture.  But you never knew. 
[02:44:00]  Because like Van Halen Guitar Hero and Aerosmith Guitar Hero.  Green Day.  Green Day Guitar Hero.  Oh, God.  And then they were releasing, you know, like digital download packs, and it was just like,  all right.  You've got to realize, though, like they could have been looking like, oh, this is another  game franchise.  You know, you've got GTA and shit like that that go on for years and years and years.  Maybe they would think of that.  And they put out, they tried, they put out DJ Hero.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Where you sit there and, yeah.  It was not a hit.  Scratching.  You couldn't even rap on that one, right? 
[02:44:30]  You had to just.  It was just DJing.  Yeah, it's dumb.  That's fucking stupid.  You've got to do like the karaoke thing.  Yeah.  See if you can hit the words on time or whatever.  Right.  It was a split thing with Jay-Z and Eminem, right?  Well, they did special editions, but there wasn't.  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  Is that the.  Yeah, this is a split screen.  That's the thing you'd have to do?  Yeah.  So.  Don't hold back.  Yeah, but.  And then you have to move the little switch back and forth.  It looks awful. 
[02:45:00]  And now you're.  That's horrible.  You're not really spinning anything either.  You're just pressing buttons on the.  Well, it's not like you were really playing the guitar in Guitar Hero.  All right.  I'll give you that.  This.  All right.  He's flipping the little switch.  This looks stupid as fuck.  You think so?  What an awful game.  Maybe that's why I didn't succeed.  I'd rather play fucking dance dance.  What is it? 
[02:45:30]  Dance dance.  Oh, dance dance revolution.  Dance dance revolution.  Dance party.  I finally got around to like eliminating all kinds of like ex-girlfriend shit from my electronic  equipment.  What do you mean?  Like dance stuff from my Xbox.  And then there was shit being recorded on my DVR.  I'm like, why is my DVR full?  Oh, no.  And then like because conflict came up, you know, it's like, hey, we're going to record this,  but we also got this recording.  You better do something.  Oh, you had some conflicts?  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  I had some conflicts.  And it was all the X.  What was she recording?  Her dumb fucking model shows.  What?  The goddamn fucking America's Top Model, Project Runway, fucking like all these dumb model shows.  What do you want to watch model shows for?  I guess if you're a model, you probably want us to catch that shit, but.  It's kind of like how we all want to watch Dish Nation.  Right?  I love Dish Nation.  It's my job radio.  Dish Nation.  Same thing.  Yeah, they really dish out the scoop. 
[02:46:30]  Is that what it is?  Oh, yeah.  They're just dishing.  They're just a dishy group of shows.  Dishy.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a.  Yeah, so I eliminated all that shit.  And I cleared up a lot of fucking time for hoarders and intervention, which I don't even  have to record.  Like DVRs are so fucked up because you record shit and then you realize it's all on demand.  Like all that shit.  I could just go on demand.  I never think about that.  Go to any channel and then just like watch the shit.  And when it's not on demand, there's a marathon of it on. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  It's on the regular channel.  You're really not missing anything.  It's not like, oh, I missed hoarders.  It's not going to be on again.  And when you fucking think back.  It's on two hours later.  Yeah, of course, it's the same one with additional footage, follow up footage.  It's like I wanted to get like the Law and Order SVU seasons on DVD.  Why?  And then I was like, wait, I have USA.  I just turned on that channel.  There's no reason.  Sam loves Law and Order.  You know why?  Because there's like four or five twists per show.  Shroom. 
[02:47:30]  And I love it when there's a twist.  And Law and Order is the only show where every single commercial break is a twist.  I like it because the first part is law.  And the second part is order.  Well, then they eliminated that when they did SVU.  Like there's no court.  They're just like, oh, pedophiles are raping people.  Oh, no, what happened?  And then it's like, oh, it must be the dead.  And then right before the commercial break, the dad's innocent.  And you go, what the fuck?  Oh, man.  That's a twist.  That's a big twist.  And it's only 9.15.  The show goes on until 10. 
[02:48:00]  Already a twist?  So now what?  You got to wait for the next twist?  Right.  You feel like you're getting your money's worth.  Exactly.  Who fucking watches that dreck?  Anybody who likes twists.  Such unrealistic crap.  Twist to minute ratio is very good.  Yeah, it's all kinds of twists.  It's usually a whodunit, which is fun.  And every now and then they throw in a caper.  A caper?  A caper?  That's right.  Probably if you're hungry.  If you want to watch a crime show, you watch your first 48.  And you realize that that's how they solve crimes. 
[02:48:30]  They go to the crime scene.  They pick up some evidence.  They punch up a black guy on the screen.  He always has a previous mug shot.  They bring him in.  He rolls over on another black guy who they bring in.  And he subsequently says, I ain't did nothing.  Then they question him a little longer because he never asks for a lawyer.  And eventually he's convinced that the cops are genuinely there to help him make things easier on himself.  And they confess and go off to prison forever. 
[02:49:00]  Is anybody from Oz on that show?  No.  Within Oz.  I'm not interested.  Really?  You need somebody from Oz?  Law and Order.  Everybody from Oz is on that show.  Oh.  Kenny?  I hate those shows because they're like training classes for the shit-ums.  Who's the training classes for?  Thank you, Kenny.  Who?  You know, those.  Oh, Jesus.  The criminals.  You call them the shit-ums. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, criminals.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You meant criminals.  And you watch SVU for Mariska Harkite.  She's on it.  Mariska Harkite.  And every now and then they slice in some personal drama going on with the...  But does it go from episode to episode or always in the one episode?  It's usually contained in the episode, yeah.  I like that because, you know, it expands the characters and makes the viewer care more about the characters when they have their personal storylines.  They're always getting in trouble with the boss because sometimes they take justice into their own hands.  Yeah, that Christopher Maloney.  Yeah, exactly. 
[02:50:00]  He's always beating people up.  Because he's passionate.  Does the boss ever yell at the people to get in his office?  Yeah, yeah.  That does happen.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Get in here.  And I'm like, oh, God.  He needs to solve the crime.  What's he doing in the office?  What the hell do you think you're doing out there?  You know, Captain Cragen got promoted from the regular Law and Order.  I guess he watches.  You gotta watch.  I just know it's on 24-7.  Is it?  Yeah, it's every channel.  It's either Law and Order, Criminal Intent, S4U, Law and Order. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, TNT does Law and Order constantly.  And literally, USA is the only channel that I've ever had this experience.  I'll watch a Law and Order marathon.  Yeah.  And during the marathon, there's a commercial for the Law and Order marathon in two days.  I've never seen a full episode of Law and Order.  No, I have not either.  How many black criminals have you seen on Law and Order?  There you go.  That's the twist.  A lot of times, it's not the black guy.  Right, right.  How many times have you actually seen the black criminal?  Only, I mean, a very... 
[02:51:00]  Out of 100 episodes, maybe five times?  Sure.  Because you could just tune in 48 hours, or first 48.  Right.  And see what the real life is.  There's no twist there.  There's always the white criminal.  That's the twist.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You see?  Sam likes a good PC twist.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, because I don't see it coming.  They were showing a clip on the news the other day of a fight between two students who were  black, and they had video of it, and the outrage thereof. 
[02:51:30]  And the graphic they put on before they showed the video was two school-aged children fighting,  and they were white kids.  Like, their graphic was, and it was like cartoony drawings of kids, and they were like white kids.  And then the actual story, black kids.  Anytime they have a robbery or a hand holding a gun, like a shooting, it's always the white  hand holding the gun.  They never want to, you know, they'll put black people in a lot of commercials these 
[02:52:00]  days that I wouldn't typically use for maybe a population with 70% illegitimacy and huge  poverty.  But, you know, those are okay.  But when you're showing burglaries for burglar arm commercials, it's always the white crook.  It's like from 1950, with the mask over his face, holding a revolver at his hip.  Like, meh, say, meh, give me all your valuables.  He's got a striped shirt on because he just broke out of jail. 
[02:52:30]  Broke out of jail.  Yeah.  You're forgetting the commercial where the mom and the daughter walk in, and the guy's  holding a TV, but he's just wearing a black t-shirt with black gloves.  It's obviously a white guy with a beard.  Right, yes.  He just walks right out.  Yeah, we were traumatized that our fucking uncle was stealing something from the house.  Yeah.  We gotta break all the stereotypes.  Is that what we gotta do?  Yeah.  Good call, Kenny.  Yeah.  I wish.  I wish.  He means literally break them.  I genuinely get outraged. 
[02:53:00]  I get outraged.  A shit-em is a shit-em in any color.  Is that right?  That's true.  It's just a criminal.  Exactly.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's one of those situations.  Although, I do get very angry.  I was thinking last night, I get very angry at those things.  When maybe I should just not get angry.  Yeah, but you like getting angry.  I do tend to like to get angry at times, but I was walking around my house last night, actually  thinking to myself, I sure get angry a lot.  It's that anger's a drug, Ant.  Is it? 
[02:53:30]  Yes.  And the beauty of you is that you're such a nice guy, but you don't express sadness very  well.  Right.  And it's not because you don't get sad.  I should be sad about that.  Certain things.  Well, you don't express hurt feelings well.  Because as a man, we don't express hurt feelings very well.  We tend to...  Anger is safe and controlling.  It's a smokescreen.  There's always something behind anger.  A lot of times, it's hurt feelings or sadness.  Sure.  Like, if a girl cheats on you, you're a fucking cunt.  But the reality is, it really hurts.  It's sad.  You know, but anger's a little bit safer. 
[02:54:00]  So, a lot of times, things will come out in anger that probably should have come out  earlier as hurt feelings or humiliation.  Which makes sense.  This is good advice.  Why would you?  Holy shit.  This is a pre-fucking show.  That's right.  This is more of an anger intervention.  Wow.  But have you ever thought about that?  Like, why do you actually care what color a burglar is on a Sloman Shields commercial?  What difference does that mean?  I know.  You're right.  Who cares?  Why do I care about that?  It's not like throughout history, black people have, you know, always been portrayed as wonderful. 
[02:54:30]  I don't even think you get really angry.  I think you're just having more...  It's more of a fun anger.  Oh, no.  I'm angry.  No, it's angry.  It's toxic.  It's not fun.  I'm angry.  It's fun when he's walking around the house in his underpants with a gun to him.  It's fun when he's by the pool and he has to keep his gun dry by the jacuzzi.  No, I'm just kidding.  Fair point.  Jesus Christ.  You never know when they're going to come in.  But it's a drug.  It's hard to...  It's a very addictive fucking thing and feeling. 
[02:55:00]  And it's just...  It's a good feeling and it's horrible at the same time.  It's sometimes un-fucking-shitty things are comfortable.  Like this...  It's...  I don't know.  Political correctness.  Things like that.  Hypocrisy between races.  That shit gets me fucking mad.  Me too.  But why gets...  Like I watch Colin sometimes on stage and Colin is so good at...  Believe me, he hates this shit as much.  Yeah.  But I watch him not allow the anger to block his creativity. 
[02:55:30]  And for some reason I feel like if I don't yell and I'm not angry, I'm not going to be  heard.  It's this stupid fear of not being heard.  Yeah.  But I'm...  It's like people I listen to don't always yell and scream.  I tend to tune them out.  Oh.  But I should learn that lesson for myself.  I don't know.  I just get mad.  I know.  I get so angry.  I go to...  I go to...  I purposefully go to websites to read things that I'll be like, ah, I know it.  I know it. 
[02:56:00]  You just like being proven right.  You get this like...  Maybe that's...  You get a very angry point of view in your head.  Yeah.  And then you'll seek out evidence.  Oh, I'll confirm it.  Evidence.  Yeah.  And I confirm it.  And then you can come on with some statistics.  Yes.  Even though you're the guy who's always said how misleading all statistics always are.  Not those.  Oh.  Oh.  My mistake.  I know statistics that are misleading and others that are not.  Because the ones that are misleading don't support your point of view.  FBI crime stats are not misleading.  Oh. 
[02:56:30]  But even if you're right about something.  Like sometimes when I see the media do it, I get that same rage.  Yeah.  And I'm like, I knew I was right.  Okay.  I was right.  I kind of knew it anyway.  So why is when I see it confirmed is it's so angry that they're not saying to me, you  were right.  That's why I relate to Rupert Pupkin.  Because that moment when he's on stage and he wants his fantasy is to have the teacher  go, Rupert, you were right and we were wrong.  Right.  Yeah.  And that to me is the best summation of a comedian because that, or maybe there's other entertainers 
[02:57:00]  that have their, or other people, but that's what everybody wants.  Right.  It's that moment of validation where everybody just knows you're right.  And meanwhile, it never comes.  Yeah, yeah.  So the anger is crazy because that moment never fucking happens.  Yeah, that is so fucking weird.  And enough people hear you being right on the radio.  Oh, yes, they do.  But that's the funny part.  It's like enough people.  I would say 100% of the time.  Oh, I would stick with enough people.  Because you block those who disagree.  I am right. 
[02:57:30]  But it's, Twitter has taught me a lot about that.  Like, it's so easy to get fucking angry on Twitter.  It really is.  But it's like, it's futile.  Me and I, I told you, I almost got into it with Eddie Bravo, but then I realized you're  not going to have a 9-11 argument on Twitter and 140 characters.  It's very difficult to have an argument.  I've done it, but it's very difficult.  Because you want to quote what they say so everybody can see me being right.  Right.  It's this fucking pointless quagmire.  You could just reply, but then the regular people aren't going to see what he said that 
[02:58:00]  you're responding to brilliantly.  Most people looking at it will probably not say, oh, he's right.  They'll probably say, why is he arguing with us?  What is this again?  Who cares?  Why are they fucking up my timeline with this shit?  Yeah.  I thought he was funny.  The anger is very, very blocking and it's toxic.  And I suffer from it, so I'm not shitting on you.  I get it.  But it really is a drug.  It's so hard to not be angry.  Like my girlfriends, I would fight with and they would, my one girlfriend would go, let's  just figure out a solution.  And I'd be like, that fucking cunt. 
[02:58:30]  I don't want a solution.  Like I didn't want to let go of that drug.  No?  No.  There's other things to get angry at though.  What's something that's legitimate to get angry about then?  Would stop looking for things to get angry about.  That's the point.  Technically nothing.  Who cares about any of this nonsense?  What are you angry for?  Doesn't it affect me?  No.  I'm with Sam.  I rarely get angry and I know he does too.  Yeah, I get angry if it's legitimate, but then I'll tell whoever I'm angry at why I'm angry at that.  Looking weak is very bad.  Like you don't want to look weak either. 
[02:59:00]  And if you feel like somebody gets over on you, you look weak and soft and like you've given in.  And how much of that can you take after being told, shut up and stop playing with puppets, you faggot?  You can't be that fucking guy again.  But a lot of times you look weaker for arguing.  Yeah.  Like if you just like if somebody's like shitting on you and you ignore them, you look stronger for ignoring them.  You're like, oh, this guy's too big to be doing that.  It doesn't have to be like a one-on-one like who's weak and who's not situation.  Like there's just things that I just don't get angry about because they don't concern me. 
[02:59:30]  Why am I so concerned about the outcome of the Trayvon Zimmerman case?  To me, and it has the same feel as a sporting event to me.  Like I want my team to win.  Are you betting on it?  No, no.  And technically we've gone over this.  Neither of them are your team.  I understand.  No, I see it as a guy that had a gun that was threatened, whatever, or the other guy sees it as a guy that was walking around and he was threatened and he ends up dead. 
[03:00:00]  But with all the facts that have come out so far or speculation, whatever, I have a vested interest in this case.  Because you have strong beliefs.  You're very passionate about those beliefs.  Yes.  And you want everyone else to see exactly how it should be seen.  Oh.  Or why do we, and this is what sports teams do.  It's fine.  I agree with you.  You invest yourself and all of a sudden, this is where conspiracy theorists go wrong.  Because we put our identity into this fucking cause. 
[03:00:30]  So the positive or negative outcome of the cause is a validation of my identity.  It's really weird how we wrap ourselves up in these fucking things.  Like I see that as a reflection of myself.  And it shouldn't be.  Who cares?  Like if 9-11 was a conspiracy, why would I, I mean, why would I care?  Or if it wasn't a conspiracy, why would Alex Jones give a shit?  He should go, okay, that's what it was and now I know what it was.  Right, right.  Do you think that you guys are tying your emotions up to these like issues that have nothing to do with you? 
[03:01:00]  Constantly.  Everyone does, yeah.  But do you think it's because that way you can get mad at what's going on on television or on the internet instead of actually dealing with what is actually your emotion?  You know what I mean?  Like instead of actually dealing with something that's hurting you or instead of actually coming to terms with your emotions, you just attach them to Trayvon.  That way there's a clear cut winner and loser.  No, because I do get genuinely mad.  It's not like a cover-up.  I'm not going, boy, I'm mad.  I'm going to get mad.  I like read something and I'm like, ah, fuck. 
[03:01:30]  But why get mad?  Like when you think of it logically, like why get mad?  Exactly.  I'm just thinking of it logically.  It makes no sense.  Justified anger.  And this is in my 12-step shit.  Oh.  But they talk about it.  And it's better left to people who can handle it.  Like I can't handle justified anger because it consumes me and I become sick with it and I become – I know it's bad physically.  Wow.  And it's consuming.  And I can always justify it.  Like anger is easy to justify.  Everyone who's angry can tell you why. 
[03:02:00]  That's true.  And figure it out and justify it intelligently.  But the bottom line is what's the fucking point of it?  And I'm saying this to you, but I should fucking say this into a mirror.  It's like so stupid.  I'm right.  I'm angry.  Isn't that everything that's on Twitter whenever it's a discussion is like – or even any discussion?  You're just trying to prove that you're right.  You're trying to convince someone that you are right and they are wrong. 
[03:02:30]  But do you see how annoying justified anger – sorry, Sam.  Do you not see how annoying justified anger is in somebody else?  When a woman's group or a black group goes after somebody, they are dealing with what they consider justified anger.  Uh-huh.  And watching it from the outside, you see how annoying it is.  And, oh, shut up with your fucking cause.  That's how people look at us.  Like, it's like – I don't think, hey, that person is justifiably mad.  I'm like, ah, shut up, you douche.  Right.  They see themselves as not douches, but, like, they are – they have every reason to be angry and it's justified and they're getting something done the same way I do it. 
[03:03:00]  And I watch from the outside, I think they're like assholes.  I mean, you don't have to be mad is the thing.  Like, you're just like, well, what's a good reason to be mad?  You don't have to be mad.  Yeah, well, what's a good reason?  You know, you could just be like, look at me.  I got a fun job, all kinds of cash, beautiful house.  Believe me, that's why I don't get mad in here.  Right.  Unless we're having a discussion that makes me mad about race.  Specifically about race.  About race. 
[03:03:30]  And guns.  But, okay, what if I'm driving home and I get cut off by somebody and I get mad?  That's what – Jess always gets mad on the road.  And I always tell her, like –  Oh, she must be fucking so attractive when she's pissed like that.  Yeah, she has a little temper.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Ah.  But I'm like, what are you mad about?  Like, especially when it's stuff that she does that other drivers do to her.  I'm like, you can't be mad at somebody.  Oh, because you do that?  And she gets very pissed at me when I start rationalizing things like that.  Because the problem is anger doesn't just go away.  Getting a quick flash of anger or annoyance is fine, I guess. 
[03:04:00]  But then I'll obsess on it and I'll look at them like –  And somebody told me years ago, people don't do things to us.  They just do them.  Like, someone who's a selfish cunt driver is a selfish cunt driver.  Oh, those bastards.  But –  It's like, is it really inconveniencing your life or do you feel like there's –  Why take it personally?  Because I think there's this thing, like, Jess always says she feels like it's not fair.  And I'm like, there's no such thing as fair.  Like, fair doesn't exist.  Oh, you have to tell her that.  That's what I –  Yeah, look at your husband.  Would they be married?  But, like, it's like I get equally angry if someone's going slow in front of me or tailgating me. 
[03:04:30]  My rage is equal at them not doing what I want them to do.  Either fuck you, I'm going the right speed, or speed up you piece of garbage.  Does that anger, like, stay with you?  Yes.  It's consuming.  Consuming.  See, like, if somebody's tailgating me, I just start slowing down and going –  Oh, man.  Just, like, kind of giggling.  That's what I would do, too. 
[03:05:00]  Look at them.  They're getting all pissed.  And, like, you laugh at the guy who's mad because I'm not mad and I'm ruining their day.  Like, I would be ruining your day.  Yeah.  And I would just think that was funny.  And then you'd drive away and be mad for the day, and I wouldn't think about it again.  I don't like when someone's slow in front of me.  I will pass them.  But then I look over to see who's driving, and then I go, ah, that figures.  Of course.  Of course.  Of course it is.  I do the same thing, too, but then it ends.  No, because I'll get in front of them, and then I'll start driving faster. 
[03:05:30]  But for – I don't even know how long, but for a while, I will constantly look at my rearview mirror and go,  look, the fuck is still in the left leg.  Like, I'm past the problem.  I've gotten past them.  I'm driving.  Everything's fine now.  But I have to look in the rearview and see how many more people this guy's fucking over.  Every time Jess goes – like, there's a bad woman driver on the road,  and Jess is trying to get somewhere, or they can't park or something.  Every time Jess goes, it's these goddamn women drivers.  Oh, but women do hate women drivers.  Yeah.  Good women drivers.  I thought it was the exact same thing. 
[03:06:00]  Hate women drivers.  The exact same thing.  See, it's like when you're – do you know how many girlfriends have had to hear me in the Lincoln Tunnel?  Oh, no.  Pass a car with a giant gap of traffic in front of him because he's going slow.  And do you know how many women have heard me go, that's the reason there's traffic.  Yes.  Because of people like that, or when they're looking down and they don't go when the light –  Oh, God.  How many times have I said the same fucking thing to different people with pussies in my passenger seat? 
[03:06:30]  They're tired of it.  How much are they slowing you down?  A lot.  Sometimes a lot.  And accumulatively a lot.  Yes, yes.  Yes.  What difference does it make?  And if I'm – you know what else I do?  And now that we're kind of working through this, I realize I do it.  I'm at a light waiting to make a left turn that only has a left turn arrow.  There are numerous cars in front of me.  I'm at that point where I might make it if everyone is astute.  And I might not if there's a delay in somebody noticing that it's a green arrow and moving. 
[03:07:00]  Very precarious place to be.  I don't know what's better.  When the light turns green, the arrow turns green, and you see a car immediately go, because then it's like, ah.  Or the payoff of anger I can get by that motherfucker not going.  The light turns.  I'm like, oh, look, look.  How long before?  One, 1,000.  Two, 1,000.  Three, one.  Where is the fucking car supposed to be turning?  Are you the guy that beeps immediately when the light turns green?  No, but I won't wait over the good amount of time to beep. 
[03:07:30]  Like, I'll wait.  I'll be like, uh, uh, uh.  Or if I see someone futzing in the seat, I will beep immediately.  Futsing.  Not paying attention.  Like, they're not paying attention.  The light turns green.  I will give them maybe a one.  Okay.  And then I beep.  That's fair.  And if it's a cab, I'll beep at a red light.  Go through it.  Get broadsided.  But it's a waste of energy.  And I mean, I'm saying that to you, but I get it.  I'm the same.  It's fucking hard to not do it.  To be paid, like, Kenny is the worst, because he goes the opposite. 
[03:08:00]  He never honks.  Oh, my God.  But Kenny will probably live to be 98.  Yeah.  Because that's just bad for your heart.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's a strain on your system.  We should not care, right?  Who is that?  Who is that?  He's an engineer.  No, he's not.  He's a producer.  Oh.  Why is he getting you all angry?  Oh, train hat.  No.  Okay, what did he do wrong?  Arr.  Engineer.  It's very difficult to not feed into it, because it's an addictive drug.  And it's like weird patterns, like when I don't do it.  Like, me and my ex-girlfriend went out for dinner recently, and we were talking. 
[03:08:30]  She started bringing up something that she, not about me, about who I know she hates and  who I happen to like.  So it started to annoy me a little bit that she was still harping on this fucking person.  But she wasn't fighting with me.  She was just kind of trying to remake a point.  I could feel myself, and I'm like, don't, what are you doing?  Who cares?  I'm like, what are you doing?  He's going to blow.  But I could feel myself starting to go into that pattern.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  And the next thing you know, we're fucking, and we would be screaming at each other. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, boy.  And I would be driving her home, and I would scream so loudly, I would blow my voice out.  I would fuck, I broke the steering wheel on my Cadillac by punching it.  Did you push her out of the car?  I started touching her.  And then she got some guy, and I called him fucko.  You want some fucko?  You want some fucko?  What a great thing to say, fucko.  Oh, another completely infuriating thing that happens, and this happens in the city all  the time, most of the time with cabs. 
[03:09:30]  Driving, someone's in front of you, going way too fucking slow.  No one in front of them.  You're stuck behind them.  Light is coming up.  It's green.  It's green.  They're fucking like molasses.  You're behind them like, motherfucker.  Light turns yellow, and they take off like, oh, I got to make the light.  And you're stuck at the red.  It's like, why didn't you drive faster to begin with, that we both would have made this  fucking light?  Oh, kills me.  You're right to be annoyed, but why allow that to, like you said, it's better left to 
[03:10:00]  people who can handle it.  You get annoyed a lot of people driving.  Do you get annoyed like walking in the city?  Like behind slow people, tourists, people that just decide to stop at the foot of the  subway?  When people get out of the subway stairs, and then they just stop right there.  I get mad at the utter and complete selfishness and stupidity of people.  That's the only time I really do get upset.  If I got to stop to like check something on my phone that needs more attention than just  walking and checking it, I will go to a building and lean up against the wall and then start 
[03:10:30]  doing it.  There are people, like, they're walking four abreast, and then they just stop in the middle  of the sidewalk.  You're like, what?  Who does this?  For every person that stops to smell the roses, there's an Anthony behind them going,  MOVE!  Yes!  Yes!  Shopping cart fucking people that won't fucking move the shopping cart to the side when they  walk away to do that.  It's fucking right across the aisle. 
[03:11:00]  And then what?  What?  You're a selfish asshole.  I get mad more at the selfishness than the inconvenience to me.  And then meanwhile, yeah, but meanwhile, you're fucking getting yourself sick over it.  I hate it, Jimmy.  What do I do?  What do I do?  I think it's a fragile balance, though.  Because Annie?  No.  For me, because, like, I won't get mad in the car.  I won't get mad at traffic, blah, blah, blah.  But I think I'm right there, because if anybody's with me, like, if Jess is with me or something,  and she'll go, ugh, I can't believe there's traffic, immediately.  I don't really need to hear that, okay? 
[03:11:30]  Oh, shit.  We're both stuck in traffic.  You yell at her instead of the people out of the car.  Right, like, I don't want it brought up.  You're a lifetime movie waiting to happen.  Because I'm in my zone of, like, I'm okay, I'm okay.  But the minute somebody's, like, bringing negativity into my zone, I'm, get out!  Right.  Do you know my manager, Jonathan, how I've ruined him driving?  Because he was always a pretty patient driver.  He's so impressionable by you.  Yeah, you seem to have ruined him in a lot of ways.  Yes, exactly.  But it's so funny, he'll fucking, now I see him, he's like, come on, what the fuck, man?  Like, he started, he's turning into a maniac behind the fucking road. 
[03:12:00]  I'm so happy.  I love it.  I'm going to get him shot in L.A.  Oh, you wanted to say something there, E-Roc?  Do you have it where you're at the stoplight, and those assholes with the bike cabs, they  come around the side, and then they pull in front of your car, so they can be at the light,  but they're on the crosswalk?  Now they're fucking me, because now I've got to be behind them when I make the turn.  I pushed a guy off the, uh, off 49th the other day.  With your vehicle?  He came around buses and everything, went sideways down the crosswalk, then turned straight 
[03:12:30]  to be right in front of the car, so he can be at the green light.  Yeah.  I just leaned left and pushed him over, and then went straight down 49th.  You pushed him over with your hand?  No, with the car.  Oh.  You hit him with your car?  Isn't that a hit-and-run?  That's assault, brother.  Probably.  But, uh, I just say I nudged him out of the way.  You just went on the radio.  Isn't that a hit-and-run probably?  Then I went out and I raped a woman.  Exactly.  Oh, I hope a guy died, and all of a sudden you brought up on murder charges.  Oh, shit.  Leaving the scene of an accident.  Also, I haven't paid my taxes in years.  Eric Nagel here for the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  You hit a guy with your car?  I didn't hit him.  I just kind of pushed him in the other direction.  With what?  With the front of my car.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  Jesus, C-Rock.  It was a push-and-run.  You can't hit people with your car.  I didn't hit him.  I pushed him.  Yeah, it was a push-and-run.  I was at a stop position.  And then you moved.  Honestly, I moved.  I'm going to try on the drive home.  I'm honestly going to try to not get angry at anything.  It's not going to happen.  It's really hard.  I'm going to try.  But there are ways to do it. 
[03:13:30]  I know.  Not even across six.  Sometimes that traffic on to get across six, it drives me batty.  Would you take...  I would love to, and I've never done this.  I'm curious as to what an anger management class is.  Because they do help, from what I've heard.  And it's such a fucking...  You know, I'm 44, and it's like the older we get, the worse it is.  It's such a fucking hard habit to break.  But I know it's so bad for you.  If it wasn't bad for you, I wouldn't care.  What's that? 
[03:14:00]  I'm 25 again.  I don't get it.  Yeah, it is very hard.  It is a habit, isn't it?  Yeah, it's an addiction.  It's such a thing.  It's such a natural response for me to get in those traffic situations.  And I'll do the same exact things every day.  Look over.  I've got to look.  I've got to see if that driver's Asian.  Oh, my God.  We're going through Flushing.  There's someone driving like a fucking asshole in front of me.  I will look over. 
[03:14:30]  But, yeah.  One way to not be as angry is to interact with these people more.  Like, you...  They all become this faceless fucking thing of anger.  Like, this faceless thing blocking.  But like I've said, with the race issue, I've had so many black comics that I've debated this with.  And I still get annoyed sometimes.  Yeah.  But I've got enough of these guys that I respect and I've heard their opinions where it's easier for me to like go, ah, let me try to see both sides of it. 
[03:15:00]  Because I have enough friends that have given me their...  That's how good Patrice was.  Yeah.  Patrice, but Keith...  He would be in here.  All these guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm very honest with them too.  And it's, you know, it's easier for me to kind of weigh the options on both sides and not be as driven by my sometimes irrational thoughts.  Patrice is always great because he wouldn't take the normal company line of the opposition to my point of view, which I was waiting for.  Like, that's what I was expecting.  And normally when that happens, I go, oh, yeah, this again. 
[03:15:30]  All right, this argument again.  This excuse.  This whatever.  But he would throw something in there like, oh, man, I don't have anything for that.  Yeah.  I have no comeback.  I'm going to pee.  I'll be right back.  You pee.  I have to piss badly.  All right.  And then I have to sit here after 10.  Oh.  Jimmy's show.  His advice show.  So I can't just leave.  That's why I'm peeing now.  You can always take a break.  Take a wee-wee.  There will be a commercial break.  When?  You can have one if you want.  I mean, you guys will end this show.  Oh, okay.  And then we'll do a commercial break. 
[03:16:00]  Take an old pee-pee.  Probably in about 10 minutes.  But he's got to go pee-pee.  It'll be even sooner.  Might even be sooner.  There's no reason why you can't take a leak.  All right.  Yeah, go ahead.  I got something you could talk about.  That's okay.  What do you want to have to talk about?  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  You take a piss then.  All right.  Because this is...  Hey, it's holiday season's coming up.  The music starts.  Cue the music.  And this...  You want a gift that's going to guarantee  that she takes those clothes off every night.  Oh, Edgar. 
[03:16:30]  If that sounds good to you,  then get her a Pajamagram.  Pajamagram has the best selection.  The softest, the most comfortable pajamas.  That she's going to love.  Oh, she's going to love you.  Yep.  She could wrap herself up in that world-famous hoodie footy.  Maybe you want to get her something a little more playful  from the catalog of fun and sexy PJs.  You could even combine the two with a sweet and sexy set  and include something sweet for her.  That would be the original Hoodie Footie  and the Midnight Fantasy Short Set,  which is something sexy for you. 
[03:17:00]  Every Pajamagram comes with free gift packaging  to make it super easy.  So go to Pajamagram.com to order.  And you'll finally have that gift  that's going to get her to take her clothes off every night.  What are you waiting for?  Call them or order at Pajamagram.com online  or on the phone.

[03:17:30]  Choose from hundreds of pajamas from comfy to sexy.  Deliver it in that beautiful fabric hat pops.  Call them up.  1-800-GIVE-PJs  or shop online at Pajamagram.com.  Ooh.  And then the music just kind of...  Yeah.  That's good.  Yeah, Jimmy's show should be fun.  I'm going to listen on the way home.  He's very good with advice.  Like, he doesn't honestly have any schooling in it. 
[03:18:00]  No.  There's no practical education.  He strikes me as somebody who's been through a lot of therapy.  And has learned...  That's what I think.  Yeah.  He knows a lot of people.  Jimmy's very perceptive as far as people go.  And he could think things out.  He gets a little deeper than the first few layers.  So if you'd say, you know, something bothers you,  he could kind of look and say,  well, I'm thinking maybe this could be why.  So I'm looking forward to the drive home, 
[03:18:30]  not yelling at...  Not yelling racial epithets at minorities.  The new improved Anthony.  The new improved Anthony.  But it's not just minorities.  Like, no average person stops next to a car that's also in traffic,  rolls down their window,  and writes fuck you on there.  I did write fuck you on the back window of an SUV  that was blocking the box.  You have no idea what his race was.  They were causing gridlock. 
[03:19:00]  So I was finally able to squeeze around behind him.  He finally moved enough.  But instead of just going and forgetting that that ever happened,  I stopped right behind him,  rolled my window down,  and wrote fuck you in the dirt in his window  as he was waiting to get through the crosswalk.  Yeah, because you know what?  Fuck him.  And I think he got off easy  because I was going to fucking throw something.  Yes, Mr. Rock?  No, what's fun to do if you may want to try this?  Hit and run?  Yes.  Yeah.  You could murder someone, kill them. 
[03:19:30]  Hitting people that are just trying to earn a living with your car.  You know what you could do is actually,  if somebody's car is blocking yours,  steal their car.  Grand Theft Auto.  E-Rock, any good car theft stories?  No.  But if you get one of those assholes  that pull up next to you or in front of you,  cut you off, whatever,  you just take your phone with the flash on  and you just take a photo.  Yeah.  But you don't do anything with it,  but they start freaking out because you took their photo.  They keep looking around,  they keep trying to catch up to you,  trying to find out why they're taking you took their photo. 
[03:20:00]  What if they didn't see you take the photo?  No, that's what the flash is for.  You do it right there.  In the back, and they freak out.  I like the idea of speeding up,  getting to the first overpass,  and dropping a giant rock through their windshield  as they drive through.  E-Rock comment?  E-Rock criminal comment?  Yeah.  No.  E-Rock's fucking dastardly on the road, man.  What you do is you follow them home,  and then you tie up their wife and daughter.  You could rape, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just to show him.  Yeah, you actually rape the man  while the wife and daughter are tied up. 
[03:20:30]  E-Rock?  It's just like a goof because of road rage.  No, no, no.  After you ram someone off the road, E-Rock,  steal their car, their keys,  and go to their house,  because he got his wallet,  after you stab him multiple times  and leave him in a drainage ditch,  then you drive to the house,  because E-Rock just apparently  just smashes into people on the road,  so he's got no real thought about crime.  The laws don't apply to Eric Nagel.  No, no.  Eric Nagel is above the law.  Yes, he is.  He's like one of those rich kids in Hollywood 
[03:21:00]  that was going around robbing people.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Lindsay Lohan.  He's not used to consequences.  Yes.  He's like Pee-wee's nemesis.  Right.  Hi, Pee-wee.  Nice bike, Pee-wee.  Eric sees a bike, he just takes it.  Would you like some gum?  Spearment or fruit?  Spirit or fruit?  Fruit, please.  That is E-Rock.  Yeah.  The fucking little rich kid.  He's taking a bath in a pool  with toy boats and everything.  Toy boats.  My dad said, 
[03:21:30]  I can have anything I want.  And I want to run you over with a car.  Yeah, look out.  Don't turn in front of E-Rock.  Nope.  I can ram right into you.  You've never thrown your drink at a car?  Yeah, I've thrown water bottles.  Water.  We know what drink,  not a drink, drink, no.  Yeah, yeah.  I've thrown,  oh, there were a few times  after a weekend of golf  where I had a couple of golf balls  in the cup holders in the front.  And I've wailed golf balls at cabs.  Wailed them at cabs.  And then they just start bouncing down an avenue. 
[03:22:00]  That's just going to hurt somebody.  I know.  I don't do that anymore.  And then a handful of pennies, too.  You told a story back in AEW  where somebody's window was open.  You got so pissed,  you just hucked pennies at them.  Yeah.  Took a big handful of pennies  and just fucking wailed it.  Into the car?  Yes.  I knew a guy who used to fucking have marbles  and he would just let them fucking eek  out of his fucking,  he would have a bunch of it  and he would just let them,  or like those little ball bearings.  Oh, man.  Let them drop slowly  out of his fucking driver's side window 
[03:22:30]  and they would fucking just bounce.  Once they hit the road,  yeah, that thing would start bouncing.  Yeah.  Like crazy.  Oh, man.  Jimmy, why don't you tell everybody  where you're going to be?  I'll be right here.  All right.  For the next hour.  Oh, yes, the big show.  I missed my phoner today.  I put the Borgata.  Tickets go on sale Friday.  You missed my boner?  Good one.  Good one.  No, I don't.  I don't.  All I have to do is, 
[03:23:00]  if I want to see it,  all I got to do is pop up  one of those sites.  Myself, Artie, David Tell,  and Amy Schumer  will be there Sunday,  February 17th  at the Borgata.  It's President's Day  the next day.  That is going to be  a very fucking...  Oh, Jesus.  Wait a minute.  What is that?  Holy shit.  Fucking the front page  of Drudge right now.  Nigger, nigger, nigger,  nigger, nigger, nigger.  That's Quentin Tarantino?  Yeah.  Are you getting shit  for his movie?  Yes.  Django Unchained premiere. 
[03:23:30]  What's going on here?  Tarantino uses nigger  hundreds of times  or at least it felt like it.  Who cares?  Let's see.  Who cares the fuck  script in a movie?  It's in the Hollywood  Reporters film review.  Of course.  Wow.  Very angry.  I wonder if Judge  is going to catch shit  for that front page today.  They don't care.  No?  No.  But why do they care  what Tarantino says  in this movie?  It's a movie.  Don't go see it.  You don't think  someone's going to say  that was using the word  to sensationalize  and get attention? 
[03:24:00]  Maybe.  They might.  I think they will.  I wouldn't say that.  Did you see  that tennis player  that was trying  to imitate  Serena Williams?  And she stuffed  like towels  or something  in her bra  to make her tits look big  and then she stuffed  them in her panties  to make her ass look big  and then she walked out  like kind of strutting  and stuff  and everyone was laughing.  And then these people  are saying it's racist.  Of course.  How is it racist?  It's nice.  I read some of the comments  under the video  and it was some black women  saying she is mocking 
[03:24:30]  the form of black women  and that's why  it's racist.  No matter what color  Serena Williams is  she has a fat ass.  Right.  She's making fun  of a tennis player.  It's not racist.  She's smoking hot  this tennis player.  It's very funny.  Holy fuckaroni.  Look everyone's laughing.  It's funny.  She put a big booty  on herself  and how come black chicks  are constantly like  goofing on white chicks  no ass.  Of course.  Skinny ass.  Of course.  So how is that?  Oh God. 
[03:25:00]  Why are you getting angry?  You know what?  There was no reason  to bring up  black chicks  are talking about  white chicks  with skinny asses.  We just said  this is not racial.  So why bring up  something racial?  How about this?  Just be satisfied  in knowing that  you are correct.  There is a hypocrisy  but you see it.  So be grateful  you're smart enough  to see it.  Do you know how excited  I got when I saw  the front page of Drudge  and saw all the  nigger words  all over the front of that?  Sure.  I was freaking out  like oh there's  going to be controversy.  They're here.  Ah I hope  and I hope 
[03:25:30]  I hope someone  gets mad at it.  So that way you can  tell them they're wrong?  Yes.  I'm hoping  that some black person  gets very angry  and writes something  and there's a big controversy  so I could jump in it.  So silly.  You could also just say  listen it's in the script  they all approved it  and historically  it's in context  without saying  and by the way  you guys are racist  towards white people  because then it makes  it sound like  you know you're guilty  and you're saying  well you're bad too. 
[03:26:00]  Boy.  If it's not racial  it's not racist  or if it's not racist  it's not racist.  It's going to be very hard  to try to curb this  because I wasn't even  able to stop right there.  No.  I was on a fucking  a roller coaster  right there.  I was ready to  we had to stop you.  Oh that's Jimmy's  calming music  not mine.  But it's supposed to  work for everybody.  Yeah.  People on Twitter  think E-Rock is lying  about hitting the guy  with a car.  You think he just  wanted to be part  of the conversation?  I'm getting tweets  that say E-Rock  was just trying to be cool 
[03:26:30]  on the news.  Nobody admits  to a crime on the air.  This is so silly.  Great.  Well I killed a man.  Once I killed a man  I shot a man in Reno  just to watch him die.  He doesn't like that song  so he throws his diet.  E-Rock  what did you do?  I'm a gangster.  All right.  Jimmy?  Where can we see  Jimmy Norton?  I'll be here  for the next hour.  Oh okay.  Doing this.  All right. 
[03:27:00]  I'll be listening  on my very calm  cool  and collected  drive home.  How long of a break  do we have to take?  Eight minutes.  That long?  Yep.  It's got to be  eight minutes?  Yeah.  People are going  to stay tuned.  It's either now  or at the end.  Oh man.  I don't want to  fucking interfere  with any more of the show.  I'll take a quick break.  I'll piss again.  People stay tuned.  I take eight minutes  and it's for the after show.  Stay tuned for the  Jim Norton show  on this  XM Sirius  satellite radio station.  Jim Norton is a moderately 
[03:27:30]  successful comedian,  an average author,  and a terrible actor.  And your chance to speak  directly with him  has a life.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton show  starts now.  The giant premiere.  We need new production  for that.  Yeah.  Like, I had them  do a couple of things. 
[03:28:00]  I had Noah come in  and you could,  we don't have to play  the whole fucking song.  We can fade out of it.  That's my first bit  of advice to E-Rock.  Fade down  once the host  begins jabbering.  I had Noah come in  and I did some stuff  in the production studio  to sound lame.  But it came out  fairly good  and it almost sounded  like I meant it.  So I told Troy,  it's too good.  Like, it sounds too much  like I actually think  that I'm fucking cool.  So we'll try this  for an hour  every Wednesday.  You can email me  questions or suggestions 
[03:28:30]  and I will take calls  and I'll kind of  mix and match both.  I'm going to go  to the phones.  We have to figure out  a way for me  to see the phones.  I don't want to sit  in Ant's seat.  It's just too creepy  for me to jump  into his seat.  So we have to figure  out a way  because Opie can see  them from where Sam is.  Sam, by the way,  has no problem  jumping into Opie's seat  very comfortably.  And Ant can see  him from where he is  but I can't see the phone  so I'm going to have  Sam or Travis  read them to me  these first couple  of times  and I'll start off  reading.  I'm going to start 
[03:29:00]  off with an email.  A random email  that I got.  A woman seeking advice.  Her name is Jennifer  and she writes,  Hi little Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  I've been a big fan  of the ONA show  for a few years now.  However, I think  the show has been  giving me low self-esteem.  I'm 29 years old  chubby with giant boobs  that are saggy  due to their size.  Not very experienced  in sex  but pretty intelligent  and have an ONA type  sense of humor.  The way you and Ant  talk about women  saddens me.  I feel like I'm too old 
[03:29:30]  and too fat  to get a man  based on your standards.  The way you and Ant  talk  makes me think that  I'm not trying  to get with either of you  but it makes me feel  like shit  that I'll never  find love.  I know I need  to lose weight  first  but how do I find  the motivation  to do so  if I'm still  too old?  Et cetera.  Please help!  Jennifer on Long Island.  Now that sounds  like a very genuine  I figured some of the emails  would be goofs.  So thank you 
[03:30:00]  for writing Fatso.  I think what's giving you  low self-esteem  is not necessarily  the radio show.  It's your mirror.  And when you get  on the scale  and a little card  comes out and says  one at a time  Dying to say that  little Rodney Dangerfield joke  Kidding of course  You shouldn't listen  to Anthony and me  Jennifer  I mean we're just guys  that like skinny  attractive women  There's plenty of guys  out there  with enough of a fear  of abandonment  that they will tolerate  your obesity  and if you want to 
[03:30:30]  find a nice guy  here's what you do  It's forced perspective  like find something  small  to stand next to  when you're talking  to a guy  Like only talk to guys  when you're like  in front of the  Staten Island Ferry  or the Museum  of Natural History  That way you'll look  svelte  compared to those buildings  And don't forget  you have those  big fat  giant tits  going for you  That can be a deal maker  And don't feel sad  about not finding love  It's overrated  Be happy with your life 
[03:31:00]  the way it is  Be happy with like  If somebody likes you  and you're like  the fat friend  that they talk to  Be happy with that  Find yourself  a nice guy friend  who cries on your shoulder  when he's fighting  with his girlfriend  and then just  lets you blow him  in the car  Be happy with that  Kidding of course  Try overeater anonymous meetings  This is my serious bit of advice  Try some OA meetings  and there's millions of guys  who like bigger women  Ant and I  are just being assholes  So don't take it seriously  There's plenty of guys  that like fat chicks  You cannot let your self-esteem  be dictated 
[03:31:30]  by a stupid radio show  And that's what it is  Because we all have  low self-esteem  to begin with anyway  Alright, what's the first call?  That's what I'll be doing  Just going through a few emails  Thank you for writing, Jennifer  And this will get smoother  as we go on  What is the first call, Sam?  Robert in Belgium  Okay, ooh  International  Call in, Robert  Hey, how you doing, Jim?  I'm good  Alright, I love your show, man  I listen to it on the computer  every day I'm over here  Thank you  It's only five minutes old  So my first bit of advice  would stop lying  to suck up to the house 
[03:32:00]  It's humiliating  I'm in ONA  Okay  Dude  As you can hear  I'm a Yank  but I'm living in Belgium  I've been here for two years  I'm married to a local  Cool  We've lived in the States  a long time  and I'm just  I'm a little bit depressed  I just feel homesick  all the time  I just want to  get on the next plane  and it's just not practical  to do that  and I just  I need  I need a  I need an attitude adjustment  to make me realize  I'm living in Europe  and I need to enjoy it 
[03:32:30]  as long as we're here  which is going to be  for the next five years  Well, why do you have to  stay for five years?  Well, we just  I just kind of promised  that we would do it  We've got family over here  her family  and it's just that  we can't run back  after two years  I just  Why not?  Like, is she  is she being selfish  or is there a reason  for you to stay in Belgium?  It's just  it's just a promise  and you know  it's just one of those things  she's got a good job  and I'm  doing a couple different things  and we've got a house 
[03:33:00]  Well, maybe you should  motivate her to come back  like you should do  you want to do something  really horrific in Belgium  like commit a crime  of some sort  and then tell her  like, look  we have to leave  like, maybe go out  and commit a rape  or, you know  have a questionable  incident while babysitting  and then tell her  look, we have to leave  the country  I'm going to be arrested  so she'll have to choose  between having her husband  arrested and her family  being shamed  for, say, a sodomy  or a molesting  or just quietly  leaving the country  That is the most 
[03:33:30]  horrendous advice  I've ever received  But it's not bad advice  You need to motivate her  The point is, sir  maybe the examples  weren't the best  but you need to give her  a reason to want to  come back to the U.S.  because obviously  your misery is not enough  to make her want to leave  She's from Belgium  I take it  Yep  Okay, and did she know  that you did not  want to be there?  No, it would, no  No, now she does  and it's just  When did you tell her?  I mean, she kind of knows  just because we talk  about it sometimes 
[03:34:00]  And has she indicated  like, hey, I'm willing  to compromise  to make you happy  or is she like  you promised five years  that you're fucking stuck?  Well, the second one  The second one  The latter  Well, you have a couple  of choices  Motivate her to want  to come back to the U.S.  Be in a miserable situation  or just sulk around  the house so much  and be such a miserable prick  and badmouth Belgium  constantly  and she'll want to  get the fuck out of there  She'll make her want  to get the fuck out of there  because she's so sick  of hearing you  complain about it  That's my advice 
[03:34:30]  Or hit her  Okay  Use your fist  That's why God  made men stronger  so we don't get  pussy whipped into  living in shitty Belgium  for five years  How about you live there  for two and a half years  and come back?  We'll see  You're welcome  Good luck, my friend  I don't know how to handle that  I've never had a successful  relationship  What he's basically saying is  how do I compromise  in a healthy fashion?  The fuck should I know?  I can't even stay faithful  Who's next?  Justin  Oh, good 
[03:35:00]  In Florida  Welcome, Justin  Hey, Jim  Yeah, man  I've been stuck in bed  for now seven months  I've had two surgeries  on my groin  I can't jerk off  I can't do anything  I'm stuck in bed  so I'm calling you  for some advice  on some shit to do  because I'm done, dude  I've done everything  Oh, well  If you're stuck in bed  that's easy  Do you enjoy reading?  I can't find anything else  to read anymore, Jim  I read everything  that there was  in the queue to read, man  It's seven months 
[03:35:30]  so it's a little bit  like a prison sentence  except, you know  without the rape  Oh, well then  my next bit of advice  How about watching  some television?  Yeah, man  Well, like I said  I've gone through everything  on the Netflix  Well, there's no hockey  so there's no sport  You know, that's my major  sport to watch  so I can't watch any hockey  AHL is like  watching a bunch of  assholes with sticks  Do you have an iPhone  or an iPad?  No  Well, then why don't  you get an iPad?  There's a lot of apps  you can play  and little games  Why fucking seven months?  What's the matter with you? 
[03:36:00]  What do you have?  Cancer?  No  I shouldn't have asked  that so angrily  I apologize  for spitting that at you  What?  That's fine  I have severe nerve damage  in my groin  How did you get that?  Did you fuck the girl  whose email I read?  Yeah  Did you get it  She rode my cock too much  and destroyed it  No, what ended up  happening was  I played hockey  for a number of years  and you take that many  pucks to the fucking  you know  to the sternum and shit  and the pelvis  then eventually  you get nerve damage  Did you  You got a hockey puck 
[03:36:30]  driven into your pelvis  so many times  that you're in bed  for seven months  and you still want to watch  hockey on television?  What the fuck's the matter  with you?  Yeah, I don't know  I think that might be  a part of a head injury  at some point  How many times  did you get a hockey puck  smashed into your balls?  If I were to  I'd probably say  about at least  seven, eight times  Okay, here's my advice  Learn from your fucking mistakes  Here's the answer  to that question  every time  How many times  have you had a hockey puck 
[03:37:00]  smashed into your balls?  The answer should always be  once  It should never happen  more than one time  I wear a cup and shit  Yeah, but dude  you know that that's  going to happen  Were you a goalie?  Yeah  Alright, so can you  still get an erection?  Oh yeah, yeah  But you can't walk?  Not really  How about a wheelchair?  I'm stumbling around  I go up and down  you know  it takes me about  three or four minutes  to go up and down the stairs  you know, shit like that  Well, when will you be  finished with your rehabbing  or whatever they're doing?  Working on it now 
[03:37:30]  they just prescribed  three more surgeries for me  but I told them to put it off  until the first of the year  because I really  rather not spend  Christmas holidays  you know, sit up in bed  and shit  So, first of the year  they're supposed to start  on the next of the  three surgeries  and then we'll see from there  Alright, well, good luck  I would just suggest  again, fucking get in a wheelchair  and zip around  or look at an iPad  because you've already  exhausted television  You shot down  I thought I had a home run  with Reed  When he said I'm in bed  I'll fucking Reed  I'm like, fucking  case closed  But I guess you've tried that 
[03:38:00]  You cheered me up, man  so I at least appreciate that  Alright, sir  Thanks, man  Okay  And I'm going to read  a quick email too  because this is a question  I get a lot of  Chris wrote  and he said  Hey, sorry to contact you  this way  I've been a fan of you guys  since NEW  and I've always wondered  you guys say a lot of shit  to each other  busting balls  as well as you guys  sitting around the comedy  cellar ripping on each other  Does it ever hit  too close to home?  Do your feelings  ever get hurt?  Or have you ever said  anything that hurt a friend  that you later felt bad about  just curious 
[03:38:30]  sorry to bother you  and then he says  chip rules  in which he's correct  and yes  sometimes  just because we're comics  or because Opie and Anthony  and I work together  I mean  you hit close to home sometimes  I think that happens  in every friendship  you don't mean it  of course  it happens  less than you'd expect  considering the type of shit  that we say to each other  but I can remember  a couple of instances  like I remember one time  Anthony  was here  and I said  I said buzz off  and at the time  I didn't realize  that he had lost 
[03:39:00]  his virginity  to a girl named Buzz  who looks like  Juan Epstein  from Welcome Back Cotter  that hurt  a little bit  one time I said to Colin  go take a long walk  off a short pier  not realizing  that he was  repeatedly raped  on a pier  from the ages of 5  to 37  and there was one friend  who I won't mention  whose mother had passed away  and at the wake  just to kind of  lighten the mood  I reached into the casket  and I made  loud honky noises  as I squeezed her tits  and then I hip checked  the coffin 
[03:39:30]  and it tipped over  and she rolled out  and my friend was crying  and I'm like  come on  lighten the fuck up dude  it's a joke  and then as time went on  I saw that  this grieving family  putting her tits  back into her dress  and lifting the coffin  back up  may have been traumatic  and therefore  my joke went too far  but you live  and you learn  Chris  that's the point  I'm making  the key to not  ending your friendship  I think is that  we all kind of know  where a joke's coming from  like when you're around  funny guys  everybody knows  the intent is to be funny  and not to be a dick  so I think that 
[03:40:00]  if someone's toes  gets stepped on  you have to realize  this person has a sense of humor  and I obviously  stepped on their Achilles  so sometimes you just  gotta say you're sorry  it sounds like  cheese dick advice  but yeah  we do step over the line  once in a while  and we handle it  alright  who's the next call from Sam  let's go to Darren  in Connecticut  yo what up Jimmy  hi Darren  sorry man  I've been a fan of you guys  since I was like  in high school dude  cool  I'm a black listener  you know  I'm not one of those people  that ever touches  close to home  but it's like  every fucking day  the show's like 
[03:40:30]  an hour  an hour  of Anthony talking  until he's tired  about black people  well Anthony  just expressed something  if you heard the last show  here's what  Anthony just expressed  on kind of crazy  anger that he has  and it's not that  Anthony is mad  at black people  and I know it sounds like that  and I'm not just  defending a friend  because he's really not  Anthony is a fucking  really open  come on dude  dude I'm telling you  listen let me just explain  why Anthony's so crazy  about Obama  in the last four years  Anthony has this 
[03:41:00]  tremendous  fear  or discomfort  of people  taking what he sees  as his  like  because he's a guy  from  hold on  I'm explaining something to you  he sees this  he has this irrational  anger towards  that's what it's about  it's irrationality  yes  that's what I'm explaining  to you  it's irrational  so Anthony's irrational  is what the point is  your answer to why  the show is always about  why black people suck  is because  one of the hosts  is irrational  but it's not about  why black people suck  it's about  he has this irrational 
[03:41:30]  feeling  Anthony we're just  talking about you  as you come in  but it's not  but I'm saying  it's not  he can't hear you  he doesn't have his  headphones on  but I'm giving you  an answer to your question  I don't see Anthony  as a racist  and I'm not saying that  just because I'm on the air  I genuinely don't  but Anthony is here  to answer that question  himself  hi sir  dude  half your racism  comes from the stuff  that most of the racism  comes from  it's just you grew up  in a family  that feels that way  nope  and you had a dad  that kind of  you up  yes 
[03:42:00]  nope  you grew up as a weak kid  nope  a little bit of a pussy  nope  that's why you clean the guns  that's why you love yelling  and that's why when anybody  that comes on the air  which I respect that  you're not doing now  you fucking yell at them  until they don't want to  no I only yell when  I discuss things  pretty rationally  I only yell when people  start yelling over me  or  yeah I really do  and you know  it's kind of fun  so you don't think  that your feelings  come from an innate  sense of superiority  you honestly don't think  no here's  you don't feel  you don't feel  that black people 
[03:42:30]  genetically are inferior to you  here's what I  that's why you yell  sub-saharan Africa  sorry do you see  what I'm saying  like you're  you're getting your  question answered  but it's not an answer  here's my first bit of advice  let people answer you  no you're right  here's what I have to say  I don't  I don't  honestly don't think  it was my upbringing  because  I really am  intelligent enough  to differentiate  between what my parents  were yelling about  and what I've seen  growing up  and living my life  of these years 
[03:43:00]  I understand  what's going on  in the world  and that has affected me  a lot more  than my family  I mean in my  in my let's say  teens and 20s  I really wasn't  affected by what I see  in the world  and in the black community  as much as I am now  and what I see  and that kind of  you're affected by the black community  right now  yes I am  locked up in your big house  no I'm not locked up  in my big house  I walk around the city  I fucking 
[03:43:30]  I work here  in a  very ethnically  ethnically diverse  when's the last time  you were affected  by a black person  in your life  last time I was affected  by a black person  I don't know  don't go Obama  that's a cop out  when's the last time  you were affected  by the way  but that's not a cop out  a guy who  a guy who is  a Democrat  that's just a president  that's just a person  in a political office  who would be the same thing  if he was any other color  do you know what I noticed too  with when it comes like race  after Imus got fired  the feelings I had 
[03:44:00]  as well got stronger  not against black people  but against that whole mentality  but I support that  hold on I'm answering you  as to why things  picked up steam  you're saying  does black people  affect Anthony ever  black groups do  because a lot of times  if you say the wrong thing  you're fired  it's a tremendous  concern at work  that you're going to  say the wrong thing  and a group is going to  target you  and this show  has been affected  by the potential  of Al Sharpton  it's not crazy  just from nowhere  there's an atmosphere  there's an atmosphere 
[03:44:30]  that's been put in place  that affects me  personally  in my everyday life  in what I can say  what I can tweet  what I can say  on the air  you say whatever you want  no I can't  I cannot  thank God  what do you mean  because nobody would want  to listen to that shit  but dude we were suspended  from homeless Charlie  you wouldn't want to listen to it  no I've been listening to you  since I was in 16  what the fuck are you talking about  well  I laughed at the Stephen Lynch  most offensive  so you're glad 
[03:45:00]  I can't say everything  I would like to say  because your show  is not about battling  you're not the show  you Anthony in particular  you are not on an agenda  to battle free speech  you're on an agenda  to put out  what you feel  about black people  on the air  and it's fine  in its space  but every day  it's becoming  a larger space  of the show  and you're alienated  I don't think so  I'm talking to you  as a black fan  who's listening to you  for the past like 8 years  you're black  oh my god  you're very well spoken  I'm also probably  smart enough to tell you  that I'm not really offended 
[03:45:30]  with anything you say dude  it's a joke my friend  dude I've had like  20 teachers tell me that  I'm not really  like a lot  so anyway  I'm telling you  as a fan  who supports free speech  who didn't  see anything wrong  with Imus  because I got the reference  to the Spike Lee movie  I knew what he was doing  as a black listener  who loved the KKK song  who's listened to you  since WAW  who knows you very well  because he's listened to you  for years  I'm telling you  you're alienating me  if you're alienating me  how are you not alienating  other black listeners  who are probably 
[03:46:00]  way more easily offended  than me  I think the ones  I'm alienating  for the most part  have an agenda anyway  and they'll listen  I have an agenda  I have an agenda  no no  I have an agenda  you might  I'm telling you  I'm telling you as a fan  I'm telling you as a fan  you'll keep listening  I'll keep listening  you'll keep listening  I haven't listened  in two weeks  I called into Jimmy  I didn't call into your show  how do you know  what I've been saying  how do you know  the show's been  I'm supposed to assume  that after listening  for a year  and it's different 
[03:46:30]  in two weeks  of me now listening  I'm telling you  you lost a fan  because of the way  you've been on the show  a black fan  not because I'm a fan  yeah exactly  a black fan  which is again  you marginalizing  an opinion  that's not  that's not  of your race  I'm not saying  you offended me  I'm not saying  you offended me  I'm saying it's boring  and not entertaining  I'm not saying  it's offensive  to you  to you  okay so make this  so just call the show  Ant on Niggers  and then make it  what it is  oh fucking guy  that's not 
[03:47:00]  it was supposed to be  announced  next week  that's a podcast  on niggers  oh boy  like I  we were talking  before  you didn't listen  in two weeks  we were talking  right before  this show  before this show  started  about irrational  anger  and like  I do this too  it's like  for me  it hasn't come out  as much in race  but it's come out  in other things  where this  displaced anger  and I'm not saying  all of your points  at all  but you get this  fucking irrational  and I get this  crazy irrational  and it comes out  on everything  and then I just 
[03:47:30]  I find a cause  or something  that's been  for me  Islam  became this  enraging  subject  and I looked  at anything  that was  kind of Islam  as being  something  that was  anti  my point  almost to a point  of being irrational  and I kind of  caught myself  with it  and you can do  that self-analysis  but he doesn't  well you know  but Anthony's willing  we were talking  very nicely  on the show  a few minutes ago  I'm going to drive  home very nicely  Ant was just talking  about his own anger  being a little irrational  he knows that  you know  I'm not saying  Ant's not a horse's ass  but I've seen him 
[03:48:00]  around enough black people  to know that  exactly  you know that  why do you let him  go for an hour and a half  to at least just  fucking  hour and a half  because it's not  because I do debate  Anthony  we do debate  on the air  we absolutely debate  and I play devil's advocate  but I'm not about  to tell Anthony  what he can and can't say  and it's not  out of fear of Anthony  it's just not my place  as a man  to tell Anthony  as a man  what he can say  and not say  but at a certain point  if it's irrational  are you actually  even delivering a point  but I've told him  he's irrational  he's crazy  he's one of my favorite people  he's fucking nuts  but dude 
[03:48:30]  this is the same guy  that walks around his house  in his underpants  with a gun strapped to him  it's like he's a crazy person  and I've come to know that  and accept that  and fucking  and love my friend  but he gets the same anger  at people  the same crazy anger  over guns  so it's like  I know that Anthony  handles things  that he has conflict  with a certain way  and I still love my friend  so I'm not gonna ever tell him  what he can and can't say  thank you Jimmy  that's fine  but you don't  kind of find it  disconcerting  that there's a segment  of the show  who really understands 
[03:49:00]  what you guys are about  and usually for most  of the part is for it  that's kind of just  getting tired of the show  well I would not want you  to get tired of the show  I'm tired of the show  I wouldn't think  me pointing out  fucking black crime  running rampant  is fucking  that crazy  to do  but  you don't point out  black crime running rampant  yes I do  that's not  you're not here  to stop crime  that's where my racial  discussions  usually start from  is talking about  black on black crime  running rampant 
[03:49:30]  and affecting  black crime in America  any different than crime  in any other country  isn't crime normally  attributed to people  who are poor  it's an economic issue  the numbers don't add up  for the impoverished  black people  and impoverished white people  and the crime stats  between the two  not in the country  globally  what about globally  in any nation  who are the people  that commit most of the crimes  they're the poor people  except in those nations  if they're not  if they're homogenous  nobody's going  oh 
[03:50:00]  white people  are all the problems  yeah but so this is not  about milk  oof  oof  how many listeners  I just lost with that  oof  I'd love to continue this  but I do have to go  um  uh  but thank you for the call  I'm not cutting you off  I only have 25 minutes  left in the show  but thank you for the call  but how about  I would like to suggest  maybe we could do this  if not today  but I would like to see  if we can go  x amount of days  on the show  where we do not mention  oh  race  or  because I have  I talk way too much 
[03:50:30]  and I know this  about trannies  and sex  oh no  but believe me  I know that  maybe we can do  a fucking couple of days  where we see  if we can  without mentioning race  at all  not mentioning  I will not mention  sex or tranny  or whatever it is we are  and see how it feels  to do it  that would be fun to do  like let's try that  okay  I'll ring my bell a lot  but  yeah  but I mean  I'd be willing to do that  it'll be a fun thing  for the listeners  to see if we could do it  I'd give it a whirl  let's try it 
[03:51:00]  sure  are we in trouble  no  no  alright  I'll talk to you in a bit  alright  alright  take it easy  thank you for calling in sir  uh  next call  let's go  uh  Brett  in Texas  hey uh  Jimmy  hello  hey  I've been dating  this chick for a while  uh  more than a couple years  and uh  we agreed that  we would try to  spice up the sex life 
[03:51:30]  a little bit more  and uh  you know  we tried some things  here and there  but she has really  latched on  to this  like abuse  stuff  like she wants  to be not  like choked  she wants to be like  strangled  until she like  passes out  wow  and has even  mentioned like  full force  like punching  I slapped her  like in the face  and she's like  no punch me  and I'm like  you know  no way  and she's like  no punch me  punch me  punch me  and I'm like  no  like  I don't know  what it is  like  and she like 
[03:52:00]  really gets into it  and it's like  man I don't like  want to let her down  but it's like  at the same time  it's like  that does make me  uncomfortable  and there's like  not a lot  that makes me  uncomfortable  yeah  I would maybe  you know  would she come as hard  if you had a boxing glove on  would that work  if you guys were just  kind of sparring  that's a rough one dude  because I'm into  I like to spank girls  I've even slapped faces  and pulled hair  but there becomes a point  where if somebody wants you  to punch them during sex  and Opie I think  was the first one  to point out  the Jim Norton flow chart  always goes to molested 
[03:52:30]  so I don't know  if this was that  but you should find out  why she requires that  like  well I know she had  I know she had  father issues  like her dad's  never been around  so she always had  like daddy issues  and you know  type of guy I am  I kind of like  you know  that's the type of chick  I used to pick up  all the time  you and me both  my friend  believe me  if I say to a girl  what's your father like  and she actually gives me  an answer  I have no shot with her  if she says  I haven't spoke to him  since 1972  I'm in  in  I mean it's 
[03:53:00]  it's really easy  and I mean  but that wasn't why  I started dating her  but it just  you know  it did come about  that that was the issue  but I just  it's like man  what do I do  because like  if I say no to her  like it's like  gonna crush her  and like that's  you know  her thing  and  well talk to her  about it  dude talk to her  about  sometimes talking  about sex  outside of bed  is important  like it doesn't  turn me on  if I have to tell a girl  while we're fucking  what I want her to say  but a lot of times  if you talk about it  beforehand  and you discuss it  when you're not being  sexual 
[03:53:30]  then you kind of  both incorporate it  so it feels natural  when it's dirty  see if there's anything  else that can kind of  that can serve  that need for her  like maybe  if you're talking  or calling her  a whore  or talking about  fucking her friends  or pulling her hair  while talking about  her being raped  or like  is there a verbal  thing  that will maybe  serve close to  the same purpose  because I think  if you keep  upping it  and upping it  and upping it  what's next  after punched in the face  well yeah  it's like yeah  when is the police report  gonna be filed  and you might want 
[03:54:00]  to talk to her about that  like say look  because it just keeps  upping and say  I understand it  but it's hard for me  to punch you  in the face  and that's not crazy  of you to say  if she said  spank me  and you couldn't do it  I'd say well  maybe you should  fucking man up  a little bit  you know  see if she likes  her pussy slapped  or her thighs slapped  if there's other things  or even really  really hard  on the ass  or to paddle her  on the ass  but something less  genuinely  man on man  aggressive  than a punch  in the face  because that's  even for me  as a dirt bag 
[03:54:30]  it's hard for me  to make that sexual  like I've never been able  to punch a girl  in the face  other than  political disagreements  then I find it  very easy  or if she talks  while I'm watching  an Aussie interview  I'll fucking  shatter her teeth  but it's hard  to do sexually  because belting  something  because you're afraid  like what if  all of a sudden  her turn on  turns off  and I've just  punched this person  in the face  yeah like  it ends the relationship  like you know  when does it  take it like  too far  you know what I mean  do you bite her  see if she likes  her back bitten  sometimes 
[03:55:00]  I mean she likes  like all that  kind of stuff  and I don't mind  doing it  but it's like  like you said  it's progressively  gotten like  up  you know like  upping it  every time  it's like  you know like  at first it was  like a light choke  and now it's like  a full force  like leaving  fingerprint marks  and I'm like  I'm not comfortable  with that  like someone at work  may see that  and be like  oh my god  he beats the crap  out of her  you know what a piece  of shit  you know  and I'm not  that type of guy  or see if you  could do something  that might be  dirt  but again  I know that  choking feels good  but again  sometimes  I've had women 
[03:55:30]  that like me  to squeeze  their skin  really hard  like dig my  fucking fingernails  into their back  or bite them  because it hurts  but that's not  life threatening  like that's not  something that's  typically an act of  aggression and  domestic violence  see if that will  help at all  you know  and again  seeing  and I'm not saying  go right to therapy  because that might  just be that she's  exploring this dirty  side  has she done this  with other guys  I don't know  we've been dating  for like  like probably  close to five years  and it's just  the past  probably two years 
[03:56:00]  she's really gotten  into this a little  bit more  right  and I mean like  and I haven't seen  like any signs  of like where  this popped up  from all of a sudden  because like  you know we watch  porn and stuff together  and it's not been  like any of that  type of you know  it's just been  like the regular  porn and stuff  so there's like  you know  in internet history  and all that  nothing shows up  it's just like  out of nowhere  I don't know  if like  50 shades of gray  or some crap  you know  kind of like  triggered it all up  or something  but  you talk to her  about it  but don't quiz her  like where is this from  actually talk to her 
[03:56:30]  about it  because maybe  not to knock you  but maybe you guys  were having routine  sex after a while  and then this fucking  Pandora's box  got open  and she was like  holy shit  do I like this  but you don't want  it to progress  to a point  where you can't  top yourself anymore  because that's the  problem with porn  it's like you get  to a point  where you can't  it's like alcoholism  like two beers  gets you drunk  and then you need  a fucking case  of beer  and a shot  and it just  never fucking ends  and that's what  you don't want  to get to  right  yeah no I just wish  she was addicted  to blowjobs  yeah I mean 
[03:57:00]  we'll talk to her  about it  maybe she would  like you forcing  your cock down  her throat  I would suggest  just talking to her  about it  outside of bed  this way she won't  feel rejected  and tell her  what you like  about it  but tell her  you're a little  concerned  but don't shame  her about it  either  you don't want  to make her  feel embarrassed  to talk to you  about what she likes  that's my advice  man and good luck  I appreciate it  Jimmy  okay buddy  let's go another  call  who's next  Sam  Wayne  in Alabama  okay  hey Jimmy  first off  I gotta say  that you  kind of got me 
[03:57:30]  addicted to  transsexuals  and I have yet  to experience  one  but I've been  doing a lot  of looking  on like  cam 4  and through  Craigslist  and things like  that  and I'm having  a hard time  trying to  quote unquote  hook up  with someone  outside  if you know  they want you  to pay money  or something  like that  and I don't  like to go  into the pay  site  to pay money  to try to  hook up  with something  so I'm  looking for  some advice  for somebody  that's curious 
[03:58:00]  about the  experience  that can  kind of  find an easy  way to hook  up with  somebody  that's  how cost  me  you know  normally  well sir  I can only  speculate  and I can  only relay  information I've  been given  of course  it's hard  to say  I don't  understand that  world that  much either  I mean if  you're watching  porn  go to X2  they have  everything  there for  free  but if  you're  looking  what do  you look  like  I'm kind  of average  I'm slim  I drive  track  I'm pretty  fit  but I'm not  like a muscle  builder  or anything  I would say 
[03:58:30]  this  most transsexuals  from what I'm  figuring  have  gay male  sensibilities  when it comes  to men  like  and again  I could be  way off  base on  this  but you  know why  gay guys  are in  the best  shape  because men  are much  more  visual  like that's  why gay guys  are all in  shape  because they  only want to  fuck guys  that look like  the way they  want to look  or the you know  so that's why  I transsexuals  probably  you're probably  no offense  not hot enough  to just go out  and pick up a  hot tranny  like you probably  have to be a 
[03:59:00]  really good looking  guy to go out  and pick off a  transsexual for  free  so I don't  even know where  you'd go  for that  I have no  idea  I've never  been in a  free transsexual  bar  I only went  to one  to see what  it was like  and they were  all hookers  so my suggestion  would be to  pay for it  see if you  like the  experience  because the  last thing you  want to do  is go out  and meet  somebody  try the  experience  and not  like it  and have  them constantly  calling you  and wanting  to see you  again  I mean 
[03:59:30]  do you  really need  that in  your life  do you  really need  a fucking  black girl  with blonde  hair  showing up  at your  fucking  job  you used  me daddy  you know  fucking  hormonal  with man  strength  you don't  need that  so I  don't know  where to  go  that one  I really  can't help  you with  I would  suggest  erosguide.com  or craigslist  and you know  it's like  anything else  take it  for a test  ride  and see  if you  like it  okay  what was  that first  erosguide.com  I just 
[04:00:00]  know  erosguide.com  and what  you can do  and I've  suggested this  to other  people  there's a  site called  theeroticreview.com  and you can  really review  escorts  from your  home city  or state  and they have  all kinds of  escorts  massage girls  and you can  see if  they're  legitimate  if they're  rip-offs  if they're  you know  if they use  you know  if they do  this  if they do  that  so you can  kind of  weed down  and find  what you  want  but they're  paid escort  reviews  so I  would suggest  joining that 
[04:00:30]  site  and I  would suggest  paying for  it first  because you  don't know  if you're  going to  like it  alright  good luck  my friend  sure  we'll go to  Alex in  Boston  hi Alex  hey Jim  how you doing  I'm good  buddy  how are you  uh  something better  okay  what's the  matter  alright  well uh  let's see  my boss  told me  yesterday  he had a  dentist appointment  this morning  so he's  gonna be a  little late  he told me  to come  at the 
[04:01:00]  regular  time  because  you know  he said  he'd be  there  so here  I am  I'm in  Boston  freezing my  nuts off  and I  just got a  message  he's gonna  be an  hour  late  and uh  I don't  have a  key to  the shop  I gotta  take a  shit  and uh  I mean  I could  go on  Jim  I could  go on  and on  well my  advice would  be sir  this is  very  this is  all my  years of  giving  advice  my suggestion  is to  find a  toilet  first and  foremost  I  attempted 
[04:01:30]  that  and I  went to  the local  McDonald's  that's right  around the  block  that's where  the downtown  Boston homeless  people kind of  meet up in the  morning  before they  put off  and uh  that bathroom  is a long  line  how about a  diner  is there a  diner around  you can find  for a toilet  we don't have  diners in  Boston  ok  is there a  Denny's  we don't have  Denny's either  you have to  find a  good point  I'm really  running into  some dead  ends here  this is a  tougher case  than the  Tranny  question  I'm going to 
[04:02:00]  suggest you  find an  establishment  with a  bathroom  and remove  your pants  and shit  in that  toilet  there's really  not many  unless you  have a  spackle bucket  in your  car  or if you're  comfortable  shitting your  pants  I would  suggest doing  that  you might  want to  give your  boss the  business  or you  might want  to avoid  this situation  next time  and get  a key  for the  shop  in case  he has  to go  see the  dentist  what is  your  question  sir  what advice  are you  looking  for  you know 
[04:02:30]  my life  is in  shambles  I already  took one  shit this  morning  the second  shit of  the morning  is usually  the worst  shit  for me  do you  have  colitis  or any  stomach  issues  no I'm  just you  know I'm  grossly  overweight  and I  eat too  much  and I  eat very  late at  night  so  usually I've  got you  know when I  move my  bowels  in the  morning  it's a  shit show  it's a  horror  no pun  intended  so are  you saying  that your  fucking  eating is  making your  life unmanageable  and making  your shit 
[04:03:00]  schedule  uncomfortable  well jeez  Jimmy  you got it  so why don't  you again  I would  suggest  change what's  making your  life unmanageable  like if you  I know  addictions are  hard but if  you recognize  that food  is really  fucking you  up like I  told that  girl jokingly  but try  OA  try  Overeaters  Anonymous  or another  12 step  program that  that really  is free  and there's  other people  who totally  understand you  that you can  talk to and  communicate with 
[04:03:30]  and kind of  because you're  eating fucking  badly for a  reason  the food is  a symptom  of what it  is you're  really covering  up so  like you  we all have  to shit  sometimes  I drink  too much  coffee  it makes  me have  to shit  but if  it's  wrecking  your life  or making  your life  uncomfortable  I would  suggest  recognizing  the fact  that you  fucking  deserve to  feel good  as corny  as that  sounds  you don't  deserve to  be fucking  miserable  and taking  five shits  every morning  I would  just suggest  addressing the  issue and  going to a  meeting or 
[04:04:00]  something and  trying to eat  a little bit  better  sounds good to  me  alright buddy  good luck  and go find  a toilet  first and  foremost  because if  you shat  your pants  it would  really make  my morning  alright  good luck  you take  care  poor big  fat guy  just trying  not to  shit his  pants  shivering  waiting for  his paws  how great  is that  who's next  Sammy  Rick  in Ohio  I was just  gonna tell  that guy  that pulled  a lot  of  the shit  between  the car  and the  car door  you know  what  that's not  a bad 
[04:04:30]  idea  I was gonna  suggest that  but he said  he was cold  and you never  want to  Club Soda Kenny  has had to  shit outdoors  because Club Soda Kenny  has a colon  like a fucking  like a coffee  drinking goose  he can't stop  fucking  taking dumps  so if you have  one of those  colon  I guess you  have to  carry baby  wipes with you  first of all  which Kenny  does  or shit  between the  car door  and the  body of the  car  yes sir  what's your  question  this is  we're gonna  Ryan in  Minnesota  oh that was  his whole  suggestion  oh okay  he was just  helping out 
[04:05:00]  and that's  what we need  chipping in  as it were  what's that  go ahead  sorry  Jimmy  yes sir  so here's  what I got  going on  I had  quit drinking  for a year  and I fell out  with my  girlfriend  at 12 years  I started  dating this  other girl  who I like  a lot  but her  drinking is  getting to  be a bit  much  I'm wondering  if there's  any way  I can broach  the subject  with her  without  seeming  offensive  she 
[04:05:30]  really  likes  drinking  and seems  to think  that there's  no problem  in getting  drunk  every night  maybe  for her  there isn't  but I  kind of want  to go towards  a more sober  lifestyle  and have  are you  drinking  a lot  with her  are you  a drinking  partner  yes  I started  to be  yes  well then  you might  want  I'm sorry  to interrupt  you  but you  might  want  to  my suggestion  would be  if you feel  it's a problem  for you  find a  12 step  program  I'm just  giving you  the same  suggestion 
[04:06:00]  I would  suggest  go to the  phone book  maybe look up  Alcoholics Anonymous  they've helped  a lot of  people  if you think  it's a problem  for you  or go to  Al-Anon meetings  because that  helps address  other people's  alcoholism  but I don't  think there's  anything wrong  with sitting  down and  talking to  somebody  if you have  a relationship  where you  can't just  fucking sit  down and go  look I think  this might be  an issue  for us  there's a way  to do that  without accusing  her and making  her feel  belittled  and like  hey cunt  cut the malarkey  there's a way  to sit down  and just talk  about how  you're feeling  and they're 
[04:06:30]  telling us  we only have  a couple  of minutes  left  and I have  to do a  read  so that  would be  my suggestion  call back  next week  if you have  to my friend  I don't mean  to shortchange  you because  there's one  email I want  to read  very badly  before we  end so I  apologize for  cutting you short  that's a long  in-depth problem  but my first  suggestion would  be sit down  in a non-accusing  way have a real  talk with her  because you have  to be able  to do that  okay fair enough  thank you  and I wanted  to read this  one because  it's like you  know not to  bum everybody  out but I  got an email  from a guy  and he goes  hi Jim  what is your 
[04:07:00]  recommendation  for whether or  not to blow  my head off  I deployed  multiple times  to Iraq and  Afghanistan  my horrible  wife cheated  on me and  then left  me I  can't stop  thinking about  what I saw  and did  overseas I  can't stop  thinking about  my ex-wife  even though  she's a  dirty fucking  whore I  miss her I  miss my old  life I  can't sleep I  can't see a  future and I  don't want to  so I plan to  blow my head  off unless you  have a better  piece of advice  maybe pills and  then he writes  where to get  one strong enough  to do the job  slit wrists just 
[04:07:30]  seems lame so I  think just sticking  a pistol in my  mouth is probably  the best choice  unless you have  better advice I  love your comedy  and I love O&A  wish I could  stick around to  see how it ends  well I can tell  you how it will  end sir I will  probably achieve  nothing greater  than this so  whether you die  today or in 10  years my career  will be in the  same place but I  actually emailed  this guy back and  you know to use a  cliche you know  suicide's a  permanent solution  to a temporary  problem you  obviously are having  some kind of  second thoughts or  you wouldn't have 
[04:08:00]  emailed I'm not  saying that you're  not sincere but  there's obviously  something in you  that's nagging you  to not do this  you're right your  wife's probably a  whore your ex-wife  probably sucks I  would just suggest  getting in touch with  a veterans group or  a you know a  fucking therapist and  again that's hack  advice therapy but  it's not something  you're going to  solve immediately but  don't fucking blow  your brains out that's  a serious suggestion I  know it's tempting and  believe me I've been  obsessed with it at 
[04:08:30]  times I've thought of  blowing my brains out  more times than I  can share and it's a  stupid selfish thing  which I know that you  understand but my  suggestion is to not  do it you're going to  be dead in less than  fucking hundred years  anyway why rush it  you know there's a  billion earth years  left you have less  than a hundred to go  fucking stick it out  you know stick it out  you're going to meet  somebody else your  things are going to  get better I promise  you but you have to  address what's  bothering you so  write me back again  you know who you are 
[04:09:00]  if you're listening and  I'm happy that you  wrote me a second  email and I think he's  going to try therapy  so if you're thinking  of doing some crazy  shit like that please  don't do it because my  career is going so  fucking borderline right  now I need every fan I  have if you shoot  yourself that actually  brings it to under a  hundred so please stick  around my friend and  look I don't know how  well this went you know  I appreciate you guys  calling in I have to  read one read then  they're telling us we  have commercials and the  great Ron and Fez are  right after me but we  will be here next week  I want you to call in
