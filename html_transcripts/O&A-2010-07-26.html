<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily revolving around their disastrous Comic-Con experience and interspersed with discussions on taxes, politics, and various celebrity encounters.  The show featured numerous in-studio guests throughout, including Jim Norton, Sam Roberts, Jim Florentine, Sandy Kane, Santa Cade (possibly a stage name), and Janine Malone.

The Comic-Con segments dominated a significant portion of the show.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts detailed their numerous logistical nightmares: incorrect press passes forcing them into long attendee lines, a substantial delay due to a freeway closure and a Spanish-language GPS, parking difficulties (eventually resorting to a Padres’ lot), and a hotel with inadequate window coverings.  They lamented the poor organization of the roundtables, which catered primarily to bloggers with tape recorders, severely hindering their ability to obtain usable audio. Despite the presence of numerous celebrities they'd interviewed before, including Robert Rodriguez (with whom they had a positive past experience), they secured few one-on-one interviews.  They recounted several humorous anecdotes from the trip, including interactions with Green Hornet promotional models, pedicab drivers, and a man dressed as Robin whose costume prominently displayed his genitals.  Audio from various Comic-Con encounters played throughout the broadcast.  These included interviews with Gil Gerard, Danny Trejo's son Gilbert, Morgan Fairchild (which included Norton's characteristically crass humor and Fairchild's perceived lack of engagement and combative attitude toward fans and the hosts),  the cast of *Paul* (hampered by poor audio),  attendees promoting *No Ordinary Family* (featuring Norton's sarcastic and offensive remarks), Bob the Angry Flower (with commentary on his appearance and hygiene), and a woman with "flu breath." Jim Florentine also shared his frustrating Comic-Con experiences, echoing the themes of logistical issues and poor interview setups (including an angry outburst during a *Machete* roundtable).  The recurring theme was poor audio quality and a stark contrast between their treatment at other events (like *The Tonight Show*) and their Comic-Con experience, which included a poorly attended William Shatner Twitter party on the USS Midway where they encountered LeVar Burton and Brent Spiner.  The hosts expressed significant frustration over the lack of pre-trip planning and organization.

Separate from Comic-Con, a significant segment focused on a heated discussion about taxes, politics (Obama and Bush administrations), and the American political system.  Anthony expressed anger over his high tax burden, arguing it hindered job creation.  A caller, Eddie, countered with statistics, sparking a profanity-laced argument that touched on Obama's policies (described as leaning towards socialism), corporate influence in politics, the cost of college, and American foreign policy (Iraq and Afghanistan). The Kings of Leon canceling a concert due to bird droppings also generated humorous commentary.

Another major segment featured a makeover of Sandy Kane in the studio, transforming her into a Britney Spears look-alike.  Sandy Kane’s unfiltered anecdotes about negative interactions with numerous celebrities, including Ron and Fez and Sam Roberts, dominated this part of the show, interspersed with discussions of her music (including her song "He Taught Me How to Love" and her label "Sexy Records") and her plans to perform in Times Square.  The segment was heavily laden with profanity and sexually explicit content.  

The show also included segments with Santa Cade, a singer promoting their new CD and performances (including the song "I Love Dick"), and Janine Malone, promoting her website and comedy shows.  A caller, Jim, shared a bizarre story about unknowingly walking past the vehicle used in a Times Square terrorist attempt.  Throughout the broadcast, extensive use of profanity and sexually suggestive remarks was prevalent.  Several other callers, including Brian, Clarence, Tom, Buzz, J.D., Rob, Chris, and Mike, participated, although their contributions are not detailed.  A mention was made of planned interviews with Samuel L. Jackson and Morgan Fairchild.  The broadcast concluded with discussions of upcoming audio from Comic-Con and impending tax law changes.

[00:00:30]  This show is like the box of chocolates that Forrest's mother was talking about.  You're a no-good son of a bitch.  Bob, you motherfucking...  We're so much fucking better than you.  Absolute lunacy.  If you're giving me the hook, fine, whatever.  What's going on?  I do what I'm told.  I'm completely out of control.  It doesn't get better than this.  Come on, it's shocking.  I don't know about this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Palaver.  Hi, everybody. 
[00:01:00]  Good morning.  Watching the news coverage.  Ain't it a lovely morning?  Ah, yeah, sure.  Watching the news coverage.  I guess a tree fell down somewhere overnight, and there's a big deal.  Yeah, something really odd happened.  There was a really fast-moving thunderstorm, and some trees fell down.  And maybe a car or two was damaged.  Yeah, yeah.  Something you never see, though.  And tens of people don't have electricity this morning.  Oh, it's terrible. 
[00:01:30]  So the news have cornered off the entire neighborhood with their news trucks and their reporters to stare at a tree.  One guy tried to try to make it really exciting.  He said the tree broke off from across the street and landed on the other side of the street.  On a car.  On a car.  And then said, you couldn't uproot this with a crane.  But the storm did it.  Wow, you never see that during the summer in the Northeast. 
[00:02:00]  When these crazy thunderstorms come flying through.  Wow.  Stupid news.  Right.  Same story every year.  Good morning, Jim.  Here he is.  James P. Norton.  Our representative.  From Comic-Con.  From Comic-Con.  I just heard a few short little details. 
[00:02:30]  It was fun, actually, but, you know, you know how it is.  Could you do the whole thing on $40?  Do you need hotels, or do you mind sleeping in the parking lot outside of the...  Jesus.  That's why we don't step up to do anything, because they just don't know how to do it right.  Was Sam here today?  Huh?  Is Sam...  Okay.  Oh, yeah, Sam's here.  Sam has hinted that there may have been some issues with the Comic-Con.  Not because of you or him.  We're the con people. 
[00:03:00]  They're very nice.  Right.  It was just maybe setting up things in advance and whatnot that might have been the problem.  Like when we went to check in, and he had a press pass, and they couldn't find mine,  and then they said, oh, you're an attendee.  And they looked at my paper, and it said attendee on it in big letters.  Oh, my God.  And the email address it came from was, I believe, our own Steve Carlesi.  Oh, no.  Why did you get attendee?  Why, wouldn't I?  Because I guess it would be too easy to have two press passes. 
[00:03:30]  Why?  Well, here comes Steve.  But Steve, I have to say, in Steve's defense, it looks like the con screwed up because I  emailed him back.  But it looks like it was their screw up.  But they fixed it.  They were so nice right there.  Oh, it was resolved?  Dude, it was like, why isn't life like this?  I talked to the guy, and he goes, yeah, you're listening as an attendee.  And he goes, all right, well, we'll just fix it.  And they fixed it.  It was like there was no problem.  Oh, okay.  That's good.  Now, he... 
[00:04:00]  Was he supposed to have a press pass?  Yeah.  And per the confirmation email I got the day before he flew out, he had one.  So then in the email correspondence that I followed up with, they said, oh, our bad.  We'll fix it.  Boring.  Yeah.  But wait, where did it say attendee?  It said attendee at one of the emails.  Where did it say attendee?  I don't know.  I'll find it.  Could you print that?  Let me see.  I'm considering it.  Because it said in the big one, attendee.  Attendee.  It didn't look like press at all.  But isn't everyone there an attendee?  Oh, yeah.  That was also...  I mean, what the fuck is...  That was...  I'm sorry. 
[00:04:30]  I didn't mean to interrupt.  But the response I got was, it doesn't matter if he's an attendee or has a press pass.  He's still waiting on the same line.  That was almost verbatim.  Oh, interesting.  The same piece of correspondence I got.  It's not true, though.  No.  All right.  Well, Sam's in studio.  See, if you don't know, Sam and Jim Norton flew out to San Diego for Comic-Con.  Separately.  Because I was already out there.  Separately, yes.  Oh, right.  Because you did Jay Leno.  Well, I drove from San Diego.  I didn't want to cost the company more money.  So I actually rented a car in L.A.  I let them bring my rental car and I drove to San Diego. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, how was the drive?  It was good.  Except the fucking 5 was closed.  I 5 was closed.  That's the main fucking freeway.  That's the main way to San Diego.  Why wouldn't it be open at 1 in the morning?  And I said, let me get the fucking GPS and all that.  So they bring me the car.  The GPS is in Spanish.  Well, you are in Southern California.  I don't know how to fucking fix it.  So I spent 20 minutes in the driveway of the London Hotel.  Learning Spanish?  Dude.  How do you say don't type me in a head-o? 
[00:05:30]  And then I get it and I'm riding around literally for 40 minutes in L.A.  I'm like, where the fuck am I?  There's no highways.  I'm riding around Tent City.  There's homeless people.  I turned around to go back towards the police station and the fucking homeless guy screaming,  wrong way!  I'm going the wrong way down a one-way street.  And then I realized it had been set by the fucking scumbags at Enterprise for avoid all  highways.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  That'll get you killed.  In Spanish, in avoid all highways, they have to be getting paid off by gangs so that the 
[00:06:00]  people that rent their cars just go into these awful neighborhoods.  Dude, it was so...  Why would you ever want to avoid highways when driving?  Yeah.  I don't know.  How could my five be closed?  It was closed.  It was something going on.  So I'm driving.  I'm like, fuck it.  I finally got on the road.  Literally, almost an hour into my trip, I'm driving.  It's one o'clock in the morning.  I figure, fuck it.  Oh, man.  And then all of a sudden, the five is closed.  So it was probably a good half-hour delay, but I finally got to the hotel.  But you saved the company a good $200, $300, so they must be happy about that, huh? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, actually, like $600.  I was a fucking good egg.  It would have been expensive to fly me down.  And Sam, where the problem with the passes was the email, you have to print out an email.  They send you a confirmation.  You print it out.  They scan the barcode on the email.  They print out your pass.  There you go.  So me and Norton go in.  We each have separate desks.  And I handed mine to my desk, and he handed his to his desk.  Thirty seconds later, I walked over to his desk with my pass and looked at him like,  what's the holdup?  And they sent him to another desk, and then another desk, and then another desk. 
[00:07:00]  And at the third desk, we looked at my paper, and it said, Sam Roberts, and then the barcode,  and then in big, bold letters, press.  And then on his email, it said, Jim Norton, and then the barcode, and then in big, bold letters,  attendee.  Attendee.  Who printed that out?  You printed that out.  Yeah, I got it that morning of from Steve.  Jimmy's more famous than 95% of the fucking acts going to Comic-Con. 
[00:07:30]  I was just editing our big interview with Gil Gerard.  Wow.  Oh, we got the exclusive.  You got Buck Rogers?  Oh, bad, huh?  I can't wait.  I was very excited at your Sigourney Weaver picture.  I was happy about it.  That is very cool.  That's pretty cool.  That was really cool, because what happens is, we got set up with a bunch of interviews.  Yeah.  What happened was, Liam scrambled last minute.  Liam really did a good job, honestly, dude.  He fucking, he, last minute, they put a gun to his head and got him on the case. 
[00:08:00]  And he really did work hard for us.  And got us a bunch of interviews.  He got a couple of sit-down, roundtables.  Roundtables.  Well, the one-on-ones, yeah, but they're with people we've spoken with.  The roundtables were good, like, when we get to the, how do you want to describe the first  roundtable?  Well, I mean.  Besides not a roundtable.  I was just editing the audio.  What was great was you were able to describe it, and we recorded it so well.  But it was, what we turned out, it was a parking lot party for the movie Machete. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  And before the party, they were all, it was Michelle Rodriguez, Robert Rodriguez, and Danny  Trejo, all doing one-on-ones, and then a roundtable.  We were booked for the roundtable.  Unfortunately, the roundtable was long and rectangular, and had three rows of lawn chairs behind it  for bloggers to sit on, and scream questions at tape recorders that were put on the table.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  It was for the written press.  Like, print media.  Oh.  We didn't get, there was no way to do audio.  No.  There was no way to do audio there.  But then I said, you know what, this roundtable, we made something out of it the best we could.  Yes.  And then the next one we did was a roundtable for the, what's it?  For the movie, Paul.  Paul.  Oh, Uncle.  Believe me, there was a few of those.  Yes.  I don't doubt it.  You walk into a conference room, there's two roundtables on opposite ends of the room, 
[00:09:30]  and they said there's going to be like 12 people at each one, including cast members.  And no microphones or anything.  And we realized, we're the only ones that have audio equipment.  Oh.  There's no mic, nobody has a mic or a mic flag.  Again, just throwing a tape recorder down on the table.  Bloggers.  So we got, again, we got close to the cast.  There was one moment where it was, who came over the first shot?  It was Jeffrey Tambor, Sigourney Weaver.  Yeah.  And Bill Hader.  Bill Hader, and who was, who, I guess was on our show. 
[00:10:00]  He remembered us.  And some other, who was the other guy?  I don't remember his name.  He was in Wet Hot American Summer and Superbad.  And they sat down for about 15 minutes and we talked.  But I'm such a jerk off because I have to sit there with a mic and just kind of hold it in their direction.  But how, how, you can't hear a word they're saying.  Oh, yeah.  And the thing is, I was sitting there with the recorder boosting levels, boosting levels.  So you can't hear what they're saying, but you're out there.  Ambient noise.  It was for bloggers.  Sam said it right. 
[00:10:30]  We were there.  He goes, this is for bloggers who will go back over the audio and go, what did he say?  Oh.  No, bloggers.  Bloggers, okay.  Will listen to the audio and go, and then transcribe it.  So for that, it was great.  Sure.  And the thing, the reason we know we were right about that, that it wasn't like, yeah, some  print media, some radio media is we were sitting at the table and a girl comes down without  knowing anything, sits down next to Jim and says, so who do you write for?  Oh.  Who do you write for?  Who do you write for?  Ah. 
[00:11:00]  Oh.  Write for Jim Norton.  Yeah.  You've read my books.  She hadn't.  She hadn't.  And Jim was like, he was sitting at the machete thing, he was in the back of all the bloggers.  Oh.  And he's getting recognized, like somebody wants a picture with him, but at the same  time, he's looking at him, competing with writers.  Humiliating.  What are you doing here?  Humiliating.  Oh yeah, one of the guys who was setting up the party was like, are you in this? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, you're supposed to be, like, are you in the movie?  No, I'm just here with you bloggers.  Humiliating.  This just shows you what kind of a soldier Jimmy is.  He did well.  It was, it was, uh.  You're more famous than the people you were trying to interview with.  Well, not on that one.  I mean, they were like, in general, though.  What drove me nuts is we've had Robert Rodriguez on the show.  He was a great guest when we had him on.  Oh yeah, he was.  Danny Trejo, I know, would have been great.  Michelle Rodriguez was very nice, but to not be able to get a one-on-one with, like, Robert 
[00:12:00]  Rodriguez, we've already interviewed him.  Yeah.  And then, and then there was fucking, uh, there was, uh, uh, cameras, talking to the  cameras.  They were doing one-on-ones.  We were watching them do one-on-ones.  Do you understand what it's like?  It's almost like we were watching a hot chick suck dicks.  And then we were at the table where we get to jerk off and look at her.  And Jim goes, he goes, no, I mean, he was like, maybe, yeah, that is the round table.  Maybe there's a mistake.  Let's call the person setting this up now just to make sure. 
[00:12:30]  And I said, okay, and I called her.  It had to be a mistake.  This couldn't be it.  And I was like, hey, Sam Roberts, uh, with Jim Norton and we're here.  Uh, and she was like, okay, great.  And I was like, okay, well, where, where should we go?  And she goes, see the, uh, you're here.  I go, yeah.  And she goes, you see the long table with all the white chairs behind it?  Yeah, just find a chair.  Okay.  So, but that is, that is, uh, all right.  So who gets the one-on-ones TV?  Um, other, I'm sure there was other radio. 
[00:13:00]  It was a lot of TV, but we should have had certain one on, certain ones.  Again, you're not going to get.  Who do we get to blame for this?  Um, well.  Get to blame.  Who do we get to blame for this?  I will say who you can't blame.  Liam.  Liam was great.  I mean, I, I gotta say, Liam, fucking guy, man, we had nothing.  We didn't even have roundtables before.  We had nothing lined up until they fucking, they, they basically put a shotgun at Liam's  large head and it is an awful head, Liam.  Fucking Philip Seymour Hoffman-ish. 
[00:13:30]  And he busted his ass and he got us a lot of things.  But who do we blame for having nothing going into this?  It's, it's hard to say if it's one person or if it's just a weird, we don't give a shit  if these guys are out there or not.  I don't know, dude.  I, I, it's all, it's so weird.  Like, it's like when a riot starts.  Who started the riot?  You don't know.  It's like everybody's all of a sudden, one minute people are walking and the next minute  there's 19 dead Germans.  Who the fuck knows what happened?  You don't know.  Can I get a short list of names together in my head? 
[00:14:00]  Sure.  Do you know who I'm thinking?  Are we thinking the same people?  Yes, probably.  Um, probably.  But, uh, the frustration, like, oh, we finally got, we did get to talk.  I, I, I mean, you guys, uh, jumped right in.  I want to know about the flights out there, the separate flights.  It was great.  I don't know if you are.  The flying in the middle of the night to save $200.  Wait for us to tell all the stories when you have the audio.  It's almost done.  You might want to wait for the, you're right.  You might want to wait for the audio.  Because it was literally every single step of the way, Jim and I realized we are fending 
[00:14:30]  for ourselves out here.  You're just alone.  There is nothing set up.  We are just, from the minute I arrived in San Diego and Jim was already there.  Who was the point person?  There was.  Each other.  No, no, no.  We were not.  Sounds like they almost had to eat each other to survive.  Dude, it was, it was, it was.  But who was the point person here?  What point person?  I guess we were talking, I mean, the guy I talked to before I came out was Gary, I guess, 
[00:15:00]  was, if there was a point person, it was probably, and I'm not throwing Gary into the bus.  I mean, it was.  So he must have figured that everything was all set for you guys out there in San Diego, right?  He was texting me throughout, just making sure Norton and me were alive.  But did he set up stuff in advance?  Well, the stuff that they set up in advance, I'll say this, the hotel at first we were  really annoyed about, but it was booked like a month in advance.  They don't even like the hotel.  The hotel.  But I have to say this.  What was wrong with the hotel, or do we have to wait for the audio?  No, there was no audio at the hotel.  It was actually, it was close.  What was wrong with the hotel? 
[00:15:30]  The fact that I had no curtains, it was just blinds.  What?  Dude, it was, but let me say, hold on, it was, it was a Hyatt, it wasn't bad, it was  10 minutes away, and literally to book the hotel, it was so frustrating, because they're  like, there's no hotels around.  And then we drive down to the convention center.  Oh, that was where, because the hotel was a problem when we thought we had to be in walking  distance.  Sam, you can speak openly, because you're on the air with us.  Well, we realize, I can tell you're a little nervous.  No, they'll still love you down the hall, but I mean, we got to get this out there for 
[00:16:00]  the people.  As we drove in Jim Norton's fancy PT Cruiser.  Oh, yeah.  The PT Cruiser.  We hopped on the Cruiser.  Yeah, we, uh, that was one I didn't know until I got downstairs at the London through  Enterprise, um, they, uh, they had the old pussy wagon waiting for me.  The white Cruiser.  Yeah, the white PT Cruiser.  Nothing says success.  But we, uh.  Yeah, PT Cruiser, nice.  We got to the convention center, and we were like, uh, where are we supposed to go from 
[00:16:30]  here?  To park.  So we just drove all the way to the convention center, and we said, oh, there's permit parking.  But they informed us when we got there that, uh, first of all, I think the cops were fucking  with us, because they kept sending us in all different directions to park.  They had nothing better to do but watch people.  And it was, the traffic was so fucking bad.  Yeah, I would imagine.  Because it was a Westboro protest.  The Baptist Church was their protest.  You know, we hate God, hates fags.  Sure.  What?  What were they protesting that for?  They needed attention.  They needed attention.  Who knows?  God.  Idiots.  There's a parking lot right under the convention center, and so we pulled in front of it and 
[00:17:00]  said, hey, how can we get in here?  And they said, well, you needed to get, uh, parking permits.  Now we're sold out.  Yeah, we don't have anything for them.  So how do you get the parking permits ahead of time?  You purchase them.  You probably have to buy them in advance.  Oh, it's just.  Who buys them in advance?  Yeah, yeah, again, the forward crew there.  I'll tell you who doesn't, Jim and Sam.  But who should have bought the parking permit for you?  Well, I mean, I guess.  Or knew about it.  Jim and I assume that somebody else might have somewhat looked into some details of the trip. 
[00:17:30]  Assumption.  Oh, you made an assumption.  You're assuming someone from here should have looked into all this stuff before you guys flew out there?  Or at least one or two things.  Who would that person be?  I don't know.  Who do we blame on that one?  I don't know whose responsibility.  Whose skill set is lacking.  Oh, dude, the fucking toolbox was empty.  We, uh, and then we're riding around and literally the traffic is. 
[00:18:00]  So where'd you have to park because you didn't have a nice permit parking?  There were no lots available.  Like, there's a lot of public lots in San Diego.  So a bunch of bloggers had it all figured out way, way better than.  There was 150,000 people in this city for Comic Con.  This is not a city that had, like, we could, and it was suggested that we get.  In a cab, but we would have to get on a line with a thousand people that were waiting for cabs.  You couldn't get a cab.  And so the only reason that we went to this convention at all is because we went past the San Diego Padres parking lot, which was closed, it looked like. 
[00:18:30]  It was closed.  And some, and we rolled down the window and Jim said, is there any place to park around here?  And the guy was about to say, oh no, he said, where's the entrance to this lot?  And the guy was obviously about to say, well, we're not really taking cars.  But he goes, hey, aren't you Jim Norton?  I've read your books.  Get the fuck out of here.  The guy, it was probably 10 blocks away, which was fine.  San Diego, it's very 10 easy blocks.  It was, every lot was sold out.  All these public lots, they all sold the fuck out. 
[00:19:00]  So we had nowhere to park.  This was like a, this was for.  You probably would have had to park a mile or two away and walk, and hoof it in.  Dude, it was public parking.  It was 15 minute parking.  Like, you couldn't do it in the street.  Jeez.  And this was for the Padres' premier fans.  I guess these are for people, because we're right by the Padres' ballpark there.  Sure.  So the guy was an old guy who recognized me from reading my book.  And he's raving about me, and they wave me in, him and this other lady, and the guy,  the manager of the place happens to be there. 
[00:19:30]  So the guy goes, hey, here's a couple passes.  He gives us passes for the next two days.  He says, just show this, tell me you're a friend of mine, and you can park here for free.  So that was how we got to park.  And then it was like, it was as if somebody had set up something real nice for us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're like, oh, this is what would have happened.  Had there been work done in the beginning, you just pull it in, there's a spot for you.  Yeah.  If you do the work ahead of time.  Right.  Before you guys actually drive to the airport to fly out there.  So we finally got parking that way, and we finally got there. 
[00:20:00]  But there was one point when we got there to see our, after the traffic, like, and nowhere  to park, and then there's no press pass for me.  I literally, I was probably two minutes away from, I said to Sam, like, if this doesn't  work out, I'm going to literally just get in the car and go to the airport.  Especially when he told me, when they said, no, this says attendee.  He was like, we couldn't find a parking spot.  You know, the hotel has no, has no, has blinds. 
[00:20:30]  Blinds, a fucking room.  No, it's just, I had, dude, I fucking.  And then this badge says attendee.  We did.  I bought tinfoil.  I was going to tape tinfoil over my windows like Elvis in the fucking hotel.  But again.  Jimmy likes it dark in his hotel.  Yes.  But I took a picture.  I'll show you the picture of what it was like in the morning.  I hung blankets.  I was trying to pull it up.  Is the picture there?  The internet sucks a dick in this place.  But they, uh.  For whatever reason.  San Diego people are fucking nice, dude.  They, they, they're problem solvers.  I called down and complained. 
[00:21:00]  I come back up and something's weird in my room.  And I realized they had come in and they had put brown paper.  Like the thing that fucking, that Luca Brazzi's vest came in.  Yeah, that heavy brown butcher paper.  That brown, exactly.  Brown butcher paper.  And they, they taped it to all of my windows for me.  Wow.  So it kept about 75 to 80% of the light out.  So with the blankets I had, I had fucking, uh, I had, uh, rigged.  They were, uh, I was, I was unable to sleep.  But the people in San Diego were very, were very fucking nice, man.  So the hotel was a little weird. 
[00:21:30]  No parking set up.  Yeah, no blinds.  But again, I have to say.  So he gets an attendee pass.  They did the best they could with her.  Kenny, I think.  Did you get the hotel?  This is like.  See.  Okay.  This is like, I don't know, whatever.  This is like small town radio shit.  That is.  You know, it's a Radisson, so it's pretty good.  It's pretty good.  The, the things we had the problems with was the fact that the, uh, the round tables were  for, were for bloggers.  And you thought the round tables would give you a little one-on-one time with some big people,  right?  I did pull audio from the round tables. 
[00:22:00]  So, so we got the scoops.  Just so you don't think that we're exaggerating.  And there was one point where I had to just kind of narrate what was happening.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  We'll go, we'll get into that.  At the table, yeah.  When we have the audio.  But bloggers kept, Jim didn't see them, but they kept turning around and getting like  passive aggressive.  They didn't say anything to him, but they were all pissed because they were leaning in, trying  to hear what the actors were saying.  And Jim was just narrating what a horrible experience this whole thing was. 
[00:22:30]  I can't wait to hear the audio.  From the back, I was doing it quietly like that.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  But it's a fun event, dude.  It's like, I enjoyed the event itself, but, uh, you know, it would have been nicer.  It needed to be set up a little more before you guys.  And we got to Gil Gerard interview ourselves.  That was nuts.  That was us.  That was, dude, the fucking line is he killed Gerard.  You actually had to walk up and say hi to him.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:23:00]  There are some really sad moments when he goes.  Nadia from Lost, right up.  Really?  Got a picture of so many of them.  You did.  But there's not as many of those signings here because it's an expensive booth.  Like, Chiller Theater probably has a lot more because I think it's a little more affordable.  Yeah.  You got to pay to get the booth, obviously, right?  Yeah.  So we, uh, scratch.  Who else was just sitting there by themselves waiting for people to show up?  Oh, Ted DiBiase, the million dollar man, was there.  Again?  Thursday through Sunday.  And Norton and me, when we walked past him, had to avoid eye contact because him and Virgil, 
[00:23:30]  who were there together, both would try to lock eye contact and then try to get you  to feel guilty and walk over.  Don't they realize?  Is that an actual picture from this year?  No.  Oh, that's a past picture?  But every time we've seen pictures of them at any event, there's no one waiting for them.  Or just getting anything signed.  You know who recognized the logo, the, uh, what's it called?  The flag?  The white flag.  We were introducing, uh, I wanted to get a photo.  I don't mind paying them 20 bucks for a picture.  I really, because again, a lot of them aren't working. 
[00:24:00]  I'm fine with that.  Was, uh, was Lacey Underall from Caddyshack.  Lacey.  I thought that would be, that was a fun one.  Yeah, she was pushing hard to get booked on this show.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  It's 30th anniversary of Caddyshack.  Today, I think.  Oh, is it today?  Either today or yesterday.  Right around now.  Jesus Christ.  It might have been yesterday, 30 years ago.  But her friend's a huge fan.  She's like, I've been hearing about you guys all, constantly, because like one of her friends  are really...  From Lacey.  Yeah, what's her name?  Cindy something?  She was actually, you know, she's a little older, but her tits look great.  She was pretty sexy. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, I saw her on a biography show they did on the making of the movie, and she didn't  look all that good.  No, she looks good.  But how many years ago was that?  Yeah, well.  No, I think it was relatively new.  You got your picture of her?  I might have an extra picture.  I have to see what she looks like now.  Yeah.  She fucking...  That's because you remember a whole...  The frustrating thing is there's some one-on-ones that we could have done, because there were  people...  Had we gotten into the press room, there was these major...  Where you should have been.  There was major...  You guys should have had like a red carpet to whatever you wanted. 
[00:25:00]  Yes.  Red carpet.  Red carp.  I would have taken a dirty brown shag.  I would have taken any carpet.  We had gravel and bare feet.  You know, shitheads.  Wait, wait.  Jesus.  My favorite thing was to...  It should have been VIP treatment all the way.  Go on Google News...  All the way.  ...after we got home to figure out all the celebrities that had been there that day, because we didn't  see any of them.  You didn't see any celebrities?  And when did you have to fly out, Sam?  Fly back home, or go to San Diego?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Norton and me jumped on our red eyes on Saturday night. 
[00:25:30]  Saturday night, because nothing's...  The airport was quiet as a mouse.  I've never seen an airport...  Why would you have to leave Saturday night?  Well, why would you?  Who wants to stay until Sunday morning?  Because then you get to see the Saturday night event.  Yes.  But they actually...  I think they saved...  Well, why fly out there if they're cutting your visit short?  Well, because it was...  The room rate was a little cheaper to get us checked out.  They saved literally...  I mean, they saved 180 bucks flying us out early.  I...  I...  No, how much...  All right, let's slow down.  For me?  You guys went out there for the weekend, but they forced you to leave Saturday night 
[00:26:00]  instead of staying for the Saturday night stuff for Comic-Con.  Yeah.  Why?  To save a few bucks?  Yeah.  Yeah, to save half a day rate on the hotel.  So, and how much would that have been?  For me, 180 bucks.  That's pretty...  That's a lot of money.  I think for me, about the same thing.  Like, the total for my room was probably 360, 370, because the hotels sell out six months  in advance.  So, to save $400, you guys had to miss Saturday night's activities at Comic-Con.  It's $400, though.  Oh.  But then they'll turn around...  Oh, don't get me going.  Then they'll turn around and make a deal that's so completely ridiculous with somebody that 
[00:26:30]  no one gives a shit about.  That's her?  Yeah.  Unrecognizable.  She doesn't look the same, but, I mean, that was 30 years ago.  She looks...  I mean, as a woman, she looks...  And that's still...  She's a good-looking woman, but...  She is, yeah.  You can't even tell it's her.  No, I can't tell.  Yeah.  Wow, that's weird.  She looks a little different.  I'm not saying she looks ugly or anything.  She's a good-looking woman.  I can't believe that's the same one.  You sure they didn't switch them out?  Oh, no.  Different Lacey's. 
[00:27:00]  She was the 4 o'clock Lacey.  Yeah, she...  So to save money, you guys had to do a red-eye.  Yeah.  And I'm sure flying the red-eye saves money for the company, too.  Well, I actually save money for the company.  I save money for the company because I was supposed to do the Tonight Show a week before,  but literally, they did...  Leonard did an SB's thing, so they're like, we want to move you back a week.  So I happened to go out there the day before.  Right.  So the Tonight Show flew me out, and I didn't want to whack serious with it. 
[00:27:30]  So I'm like, fuck it, let's do the Tonight Show, fly me out, because I'm already there.  And then you guys fly me back.  So they saved half the air for that way.  But see, at that point, you're making up for it, so give them the hotel and have them stay for the Saturday night festivities.  Well, logically, you're already ahead of the game, so do the right thing and let these guys sleep in San Diego Saturday night  and go to the airport first thing Sunday.  By then, there were no flights.  By then, there were no flights.  Big Kev is checking in.  Was Big Kev out there?  No.  We did not see him, no.  Big Kev, you weren't out there? 
[00:28:00]  No.  For the first time in eight years, I didn't go.  Okay.  You would have been a good guy to be out there with, because Kev knows how to navigate these things,  and he knows the right people.  We were both saying how much we kind of wished you were out there.  No, you really need to turn those table situations into one-on-ones,  and that's the real trick there, because since you're not a TV outlet,  they don't really give a terrible amount of crap about you.  So, you know, you have to kind of make those situations happen like this. 
[00:28:30]  And I think a good example, if you could pull up the Samuel L. Jackson interview,  that is a prime example of how you turn these things, you take the lemons,  and you make cat piss out of them.  There were press rooms to get into, by the way, and Sam noticed this, too,  was fucking, there were guys, they had panels in, like, these 4,000-seat halls.  They had some good panels, like, the Expendables panel was good. 
[00:29:00]  Like, on that one was Couture, was Stone Cold.  Stallone.  Bruce Willis.  Bruce Willis.  Fucking Jean-Claude, who was it, Van Damme?  No, it was Dolph Lundgren.  Dolph Lundgren.  All these people, and of course we got nowhere, we had Randy Couture booked,  but literally he was running late, and then we had to leave to interview Pendulette.  So he would have done us, but it was literally just a traffic issue.  It wasn't Randy.  Yeah.  But it's like, how did we not get in the press room?  Stallone has a lot of his own money involved in the Expendables. 
[00:29:30]  He was doing a lot of different things.  He should absolutely have been in that room.  Well, who do we blame for that?  Those things are booked so far in advance, so far in advance, that if you're not part  of the initial setup.  I mean, if Liam got you into anything, God bless Liam, because you can't get in anything  there.  Yeah, Sam got into some rooms in 07.  This is the thing.  It's a whole different animal now.  He went out there in 07 for K-Rock.  And no, Liam did actually do a good job, and I'm not just being polite. 
[00:30:00]  He really did scramble, because no one had done anything for him.  But literally, there was nothing done for us before that, as far as getting people.  And Liam fucking busted his ass and made something out of the trip.  It would have been a disaster had Liam not stepped up.  Yeah.  Was it his job?  You've just been interviewing people in Batman costumes all weekend.  It wasn't his job to set it up ahead of time, right?  Well, he didn't.  No, no.  He hadn't been put on the case, I guess.  Oh, my God.  Um, when he was put on the case, he did a great job.  I did mention...  I want to...  Why was he put on the case? 
[00:30:30]  I don't...  I don't know.  I did mention, like...  I can't wait for these mics to go off to get the real story.  Oh, when this whole thing started...  Oh, I know.  When the whole...  I want to see a responsibility.  ...idea popped up, I did mention to people that we really need to...  Jump on this.  One of the key aspects of doing this trip would be...  But they had to wait for sponsor money.  They weren't going to book us anything if they didn't have sponsor money, because they weren't  sure we were going until about two weeks before the, uh...  Yeah, so...  And by then, Big Hits probably right, they were all booked.  But again, we still could have... 
[00:31:00]  I guarantee you, we talked...  I don't want to say what friend I talked to, who has certain friends out there, but he  was telling us where he...  Like, a buddy of ours who used to work for this show kind of knew where everybody was  at any given time.  Of course he did.  Sounds like a guy who could have gotten me into rooms in 2007.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And again, we couldn't have...  I'm not saying we could have gotten a 20-minute sit-down with Bruce Willis.  Again, TV has that advantage over radio, but there's a line between what TV and Fox and  NBC can get, and bloggers. 
[00:31:30]  We should have been in between there.  But you're also downplaying the radio thing.  We're one of the biggest radio shows in the country.  Without a doubt, and...  No, I mean, that should have some kind of pull out there.  Well, if it's told to the right people.  If the right people are working.  Because there are guys...  The fact that one of the biggest radio shows is going to be at Comic-Con, someone that understands  how to work that.  And even, like, those guys aside, there are people that know this...  Like, Jonah Hill came in here, and he remembered the show when he did the show just recently.  Uh-huh.  He was out there.  So we didn't get near Jonah Hill. 
[00:32:00]  Tina Fey was out there.  Seth Rogen.  Tina knows me.  Seth, we've had in...  I've had all these people on the show.  We couldn't get one on one.  Joel McHale.  We actually...  Yeah, we couldn't get one on one.  Holy shit.  No, here's what we did.  Joel's done our show ten times easy.  There was another roundtable that day scheduled for Chevy Chase, Joel McHale, for community.  Yes.  And I canceled it.  I said, no.  I could not go through the humiliation of sitting there with a bunch of bloggers.  And look, no disrespect to people that blog.  Okay, that's what you do.  But to be with a guy who we've had on the fucking show... 
[00:32:30]  Exactly.  ...and who I've seen, you know, socially indifferent, like, you know, just bumped into...  It would have been too humiliating to sit there.  Because literally, I was sitting next to Jeffrey Tambor in the first one, and I'm holding a  microphone, and Sigourney was next to him, and there was no way to stick the mic in  her face, so I just kind of had to lean it, just kind of edge it out towards people.  You know, one of those NFL parabolic mics they use on the sideline to get their call?  And in terms of, like, fighting with the other bloggers, like, in Jim's defense, I would 
[00:33:00]  say that some of the people might have noticed he was on the Tonight Show that week, and so  you can't sit at a round table and start trying to push bloggers.  When you're on the Tonight Show, that we shouldn't be competing with these people.  You're actually doing, like, an interview segment at a different con.  It's like, what?  Oh.  Oh, yeah, that was from the invention con.  The invention con.  The inventor.  But I don't mind...  It's not even an inflated sense of self, and honestly...  No, no, no, no. 
[00:33:30]  It's what it is.  It's...  We should have had one-on-ones with certain people.  Joel McHale.  Joel McHale.  But who's...  Seriously, who sets that up ahead of time?  I'm still confused.  I think it...  You get on a press list way, way in advance.  No, it's not...  You need a talent booker that knows people, that has relationships with a person that  can say, hey, buddy, you know, Norton, just tell Joel, or who can call Joel and say, hey,  Joel, you remember Norton, he's coming down.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll set something up. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, you kind of...  We're going to sound like a broken record, but that's why we like our old pal, Roland,  because...  Oh, he can do that stuff?  He worked for the show personally.  He can do that.  He had a vested interest in us personally and made sure that we were taken care of, which  brought big-time celebrities to our show, which made our show better.  But for some reason, they don't understand that's still down the hall.  What you need is someone to call up, because again, some of the publicists...  And the sad part is they have a position open here at SiriusXM, and they still won't hire  our pal Roland, which we know will do a much better job booking the show for us, because  he'll have our personal interest. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  And it's, again, sometimes you have to let the publicists know, because they don't  like...  Like, the West Coast publicists, a lot of them don't know the show as much, because it wasn't  on Terrestrial.  So what you need is someone to call them and go, look, these guys have a...  It's a massive audience.  It's a very large listening audience.  They give you a good...  Whatever.  Just someone to call them, and they go, oh, all right, we've heard of those guys.  We kind of heard they were dicks.  Are they okay?  You know what I mean?  Someone is smooth.  Because sometimes their reputation is unjustified.  Yeah, true.  And we know that.  So it's like, you kind of want someone just to smooth it out a little bit and go, look,  these guys will be here. 
[00:35:00]  Stallone...  Someone tells...  Because he...  Stallone was on our show.  He loved it, too.  He was on the show.  He stayed longer than he was supposed to.  He enjoyed the interview.  He loved it.  And he's fucking got a lot of his own money in this film.  He absolutely, I think, could have been gotten...  Had he been pursued with anybody saying, look, these guys really will...  We're not talking to his audience, though.  A movie like Expendables.  You're right, because why would the Opie and Anthony audience...  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  There's no male demo.  No, not at all.  There, that's right.  Get them on there.  This would not be a good place for a Sylvester Stallone interview. 
[00:35:30]  To be fair, there's no reason to paint a negative cloud over the whole trip.  Again, later in the show, exclusives with Gil Gerard and Bob the Angry Flower.  So, Jess, everybody just stop.  Bob the Angry Flower.  Oh.  And I have no doubt you guys, you know, did great out there, obviously.  I don't want to...  Look, I hate to say it in advance, but just to keep people listening,  the Morgan Fairchild.  The Morgan Fairchild.  That's right.  Exclusive.  Wow. 
[00:36:00]  Exclusive.  Oh, well.  Oh, your teeth hurt a little bit.  Morgan Fairchild.  Was there a...  Is there a blogger hierarchy?  Did you notice, like, certain bloggers, like, a little better than the other ones?  They're like, you know, look who I write for.  I didn't notice who they were with because they all just threw their recorders on the table.  Only at the round table did one guy, who was a nice enough guy.  They told us who they wrote for.  Yeah.  Pretty big blogging sites, but we didn't... 
[00:36:30]  At the Robert Rodriguez round table, the outdoors one, where we were trying to get audio...  Bagpipes in the background.  Yeah.  We were outdoors in a parking lot.  And the machete party was cool.  They had the stars there.  But, uh...  Real fucking stars.  We couldn't get one-on-ones with them.  No.  And meanwhile, if they're promoting a Comic-Con in a parking lot, they're doing some real promotion  for the film.  Danny Trejo was wearing his costume from the movie.  Yeah, yeah.  That is really...  He was promoting the movie.  That is pushing for the movie. 
[00:37:00]  Absolutely.  He had a vest on with fake knives on it.  He was...  When do we get to hear this audio?  Soon.  Very soon?  Danny, is that picture up?  I'm sorry, Sam.  Is that picture up?  My Twitter.  I think I took a picture of...  What was it a picture that I took?  I don't know.  You probably have a shitload of pictures up there from Comic-Con.  No, no.  But I had one with...  Trejo.  No, no.  I did meet Trejo.  But I'm trying to see where the...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I got a picture of... 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  You can see that's where we were supposed to be.  Do you see those chairs?  Oh, my God.  I think White Frog is down because I can't get to any of your pictures.  Oh.  And we flip-canned everything, too.  So we recorded the experience of trying to...  Oh, you are like sitting in the...  It's like, how do you get audio for a radio show in that situation?  Wait, this is your seat?  Oh, yeah.  Any one of those seats.  And the tables between...  This is your perspective.  Yeah.  This is where you're sitting.  Well, we could have sat in that third row. 
[00:38:00]  There was like three rows of chairs, but there was no microphone set up by the talent, which  is not the actor's fault, but there's no microphones.  Norman went to the bathroom and I go, Jim, do you want me to grab us a couple seats?  And he looked at me and he said, no.  I wasn't going to sit there and attempt to get...  No.  There was no way to get audio.  Now, why wouldn't there be a...  You know, they go through all this to get the celebrities there and everything.  Why wouldn't there be like a PA, just a small PA system, even though it's bloggers and stuff  like...  It's not worth spending the money on it because they don't need to hear their questions, so 
[00:38:30]  they don't need to mic themselves.  All they need...  They all pushed their chairs up as close to the table as they could.  Holy shit.  And literally, all three rows crowded the table and then they just started shouting  questions and they...  I mean, they weren't concerned and they shouldn't have been because they had...  Their tape recorders, they put them right on the table in front of them.  And they just have a list of their questions.  Later on, they can just...  They just go listen to the soundbites and throw in a quote to their article.  Right.  And listen to everybody else's question because, like, you know, you guys, all three of us 
[00:39:00]  ask questions.  You got all three on tape and then you can just write an article.  Write an article.  There were people at the round tables that didn't...  They didn't ask one question.  They were just recording it because they got their quotes.  That's it.  So, uh...  Unfortunately...  And we...  I mean, I guess we can get...  We don't really have any soundbites because...  Why can't you just read quotes?  We could read some quotes from...  But no, we, uh...  We did, you know...  We've been talking about this for 40 minutes.  What was the point of going out there?  Really?  For...  Holy shit.  Oh, wow.  Um...  You say it's hard to get audio...  I'm still confused. 
[00:39:30]  What was the point?  You say it's hard to get audio at things like this.  We did it.  So we did get audio.  It's difficult, but we made the most of it.  The likes of Gil Gerard.  And we got Gil Gerard.  And we have plenty of audio from the Machete Roundtable.  I, uh...  I can't wait to hear it.  It's really bang-up stuff.  We should take a break so Sam can cut up the rest of the audio.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Exclusive audio from Jim Norton and Sam.  And Gil Gerard.  From Comic-Con.  And Gil Gerard.  And Gil Gerard.  How did Gil look? 
[00:40:00]  He didn't look bad.  Yeah?  I only got...  I only got a photo with him because I wasn't sure if E-Rock had one, and I wanted to hurt  him if he didn't.  Like, I was hoping it would bother him.  Big, uh...  Big fan of Gil Gerard?  I'm sure he is.  Uh, yeah, Gil Gerard looked...  But Rogers...  Was he hoping that someone would take a machete to his head while he sat there?  He couldn't have been happy.  There were some cool people that we didn't know were going to be there, though.  Like, fucking...  We're on the...  Oh, we have to talk about the party later.  Oh, yeah.  We got audio from the Twitter party.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  These guys got it under control. 
[00:40:30]  We just need the audio to play off.  Big Cav, thank you, sir.  All right.  See ya.  Bye, buddy.  And if you...  That was a big Cav.  If you like...  If you like stories about LeVar Burton, stay tuned.  LeVar Burton stories?  LeVar Burton stories.  Was he there?  Yeah, somebody was humiliated by LeVar Burton.  When will we have the audio?  Ten minutes?  Uh, I'll get it done during the break.  All right.  Yeah.  So when we get back, we'll start playing some of the audio from Comic-Con.  We go to break here with Big Cav's amazing interview with Sam Jackson.  Yes. 
[00:41:00]  This is Big Cav.  I'm here with Sam Jackson, talking about snakes on a plane.  Okay.  Go ahead, sir.  What do you want me to say about it?  Tell me everything about it.  Ah, jeez.  It's, uh...  It's kind of what it sounds like.  You know, it's a bunch of poisonous snakes on a plane full of passengers.  Us trying to survive.  The snakes kind of doing what snakes do.  Running around, killing people. 
[00:41:30]  We got great snakes.  We got great victims.  And we got a really, you know, thrill ride for you if you come and see this thing.  Very good.  That's Sam Jackson talking about snakes on a plane.  Happy birthday, Mick.  Happy birthday. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah?  67.  What?  I remember when they, uh...  Oh, I don't even want to admit I remember this.  I was going to say, oh, congrats to Mick Foley.  I thought that was who you were talking about.  And I didn't realize he was that old.  We got the Stones playing in the background.  Ah.  Got the little connection there.  I figured that now.  I remember, uh...  Mick Jagger celebrating his 40th birthday on stage.  And them saying, is he too old to rock?  Is he too old to rock and roll?  That was 27 years ago. 
[00:42:30]  Jesus.  He almost 70?  He's 67 today.  67?  Who's older?  Oh.  Helen Mirren or Mick Jagger?  Helen Mirren, the one that likes to take her clothes off as an old broad?  Well, also what she likes to do is, um, uh, eat frozen yogurt from a homeless man.  It was a terrific video on TMZ.  You know Radio Man?  Yeah.  Radio Man, I think it was yogurt.  He was eating some yogurt.  And she walks by, and he goes, hey, you want to try some yogurt or something like that? 
[00:43:00]  And you would think she would laugh and just keep walking.  She stopped, walked over to Radio Man, used his spoon, and had a little frozen yogurt with Radio Man.  AIDS.  Apparently she knows him.  I know somebody on the set of that.  Oh, really?  And she actually got him in the movie.  Oh, really?  Like, she actually really likes him.  She said, like, Helen was like, hold on, stay here.  She went in her trailer and came out and actually hung out with him.  Like, she knows him.  Radio Man's been in a lot of movies.  He has, right?  He's a staple of New York City.  I see him all the time.  I think he's batshit crazy, though.  Is he homeless, though? 
[00:43:30]  I don't know what he is.  But he gives the impression of being batshit crazy.  You wouldn't share a yogurt with him, regardless.  No.  Yeah.  So who's older?  Helen Mirren or Mick Jagger?  I'd say Mick.  I'm going to guess Helen by a year.  Mick Jagger, 67.  Helen Mirren celebrates her 65th birthday today.  Mick Jagger is older than Helen Mirren.  She played the queen.  She played the queen. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  And on this date, I don't know why people would care, Babe Ruth was seen in public for the  last time, 62 years ago today.  With his dick out chasing some woman.  You think he was chasing fucking...  Womanizing drunk.  He's trying to fuck Marilyn Monroe.  Her husband's overrated.  He was chasing skirt right to the last breath, you think?  He certainly was.  Throat just ravaged.  And you know Hey Jude by Lenny and McCartney?  Sure.  42 years ago. 
[00:44:30]  Wow.  Yep.  Yep.  That's pretty funny.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  And the radio host discussing celebrities' birthday bit is 75 years old today.  Just being a smartass.  I don't get it.  I don't even get it at all, actually.  Why?  Like, doing that bit that you just did is 75 years old today. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, really?  Just saying that people talking about radio hosts is just...  I mean, I have birthdays.  I thought it was funny.  It's depressing that he's 67 years old, though.  It's like fucking...  It sounds because it's close to 70.  Yeah, yeah.  60 is livable.  Right.  63 is...  60, 70 is...  You're almost 70, motherfucker.  Once people you grew up listening to or watching and saw them as young people cracked that 70 mark, 
[00:45:30]  wow.  Used to say that when they cracked 50, when they cracked 60.  Oh, I know, yeah, yeah.  67.  And he'll make it to 70 on stage, I mean.  Easily.  I saw him a couple years ago.  He must have been 64, 65, and he was running around better than the young fucking rockers.  Really?  I bought a Rolling Stones special on my iPad.  We were just on the iPad.  Yeah.  What was the album they recorded?  The double album?  Main Street.  Exile on Main Street?  Exile on Main Street. 
[00:46:00]  One of the greatest LPs of all time.  I call it an LP because it was...  It was.  Long playing.  Yep.  And the story behind that, it's like a one-hour documentary, which has the Stones today interviewed  like Nick and Keith.  It was really, really fucking interesting how they did that in a house in the south of France  because they left England because they didn't want to pay the taxes because it was a 93%  tax rate at that time.  Jeez.  How the hell is that?  They said if you made a million dollars, a million quid, they called it, you'd have 
[00:46:30]  kept $70,000 out of a million.  What?  That's what the tax rate was in England at that time.  Amazing.  We're heading that way.  I know.  We certainly are.  Oh, God.  It's upsetting.  We are heading that way.  It's so upsetting.  You wait until after the first of the year.  The shit you're going to see kick in.  People are actually debating.  And you know there are family members that are looking and going, I sure hope he dies  before fucking midnight on the 31st of December. 
[00:47:00]  Who dies?  Anybody that's sick right now.  Anyone that is sick right now that has a family member that could be dying on life support,  whatever.  They are going to pull that fucking plug before midnight on the 31st of December because the  tax rate on death tax goes into effect.  There's no death tax right now.  So if you die, your estate gets taxed in certain ways, but there's no actual death tax. 
[00:47:30]  It goes up to, I think, 55% something.  I'm not sure of the percentage, but they take 55% of your shit.  After the first, you die, government gets half your shit.  Right.  Government takes half the shit, and then the family gets the rest.  And then based on other things, you could actually owe the government money if a family  member dies after the end of this year. 
[00:48:00]  So now you've got to figure this.  You've got somebody there.  They're on respirator.  They're going to die.  They say, obviously, they're going to die.  How does that help the country?  Like, if you die, you've got...  Oh, dude, it gives more money.  No, how does it help the country?  It gives more money to the government to spend.  Yeah, but when your loved one dies, I mean, the beauty of having a loved one dies is you  get some of their shit.  Get some of their shit.  Which makes your life a little easier, right?  It'll go to some fucking, I don't know, some program that'll be fantastic and help everybody. 
[00:48:30]  Jesus.  Fuck you.  That's unbelievable.  I'm so disgusted.  You know what?  Also, I'm not going to be employing as many people.  I'm not going to do...  What do you think?  I get people come over my house all the time.  There's painters in there.  There's carpenters.  There's just shit happening at my house a lot.  I'm not going to be able to fucking swing that at the rate I'm going to be taxed after  the first of the year.  It's bad enough now.  They're going to tax me.  So is that going to get jobs? 
[00:49:00]  Is that going to help unemployment by taxing the fuck out of everybody and small businesses?  All the people that actually employ people.  Unemployment's at about 10%, a little below 10%.  You want to make jobs.  You don't tax the people that give people fucking jobs.  You dumb fuck.  Oh, I cannot wait until November and just vote out these motherfuckers.  Just leave.  You know how funny it would be if you accidentally hit the wrong button?  Oh, I will not hit the wrong button. 
[00:49:30]  I will study.  You do realize you'll bring in new motherfuckers, though, right?  New motherfuckers, though, but it ain't going to tax the fuck out of me.  And they're going to turn the clock back?  It's going to be just as fucking painful.  There have been tax cuts.  Republicans have come in and cut taxes.  They've done it in the past.  Well, I want to see a tax cut where I completely notice.  Well, you know what?  You're going to see a tax fucking raising that you're going to notice.  That's for shit sure.  My point is they both suck. 
[00:50:00]  Both sides suck.  Not happy with either side.  That's not true, Maul.  The problem is when you give a tax break to people that give out jobs, they don't create new jobs.  They buy a third house and Bora Bora and a yacht.  That's not true.  They employ more people to make their business bigger so they can get more money and then buy a fucking third house and Bora Bora and a yacht.  At this point, I know.  You know why I know, motherfuckers?  I know because I'm living it. 
[00:50:30]  Don't fucking tell me stats or this guy is telling one story of this.  I live this shit.  I make X amount of money.  Tell them how rich you are, Anthony.  I employ.  Tell them how rich you are.  I'd like to know.  I say X amount.  You tell them how rich you are and how you're frustrated by this.  I employ people.  I employ people.  Tell them.  And then if I'm taxed too much, I don't employ people.  That's how it fucking works.  Which means you're going to have a dirty pool. 
[00:51:00]  Exactly.  A filthy, dirty pool.  The grass might grow a little too high for your liking.  Ugh, fuckers.  They're just fucking...  Well, Eddie's going to get in on this one.  Eddie in St. Louis.  Eddie.  Eddie.  How you doing, guys?  I just wanted to ask my friend, Anthony, if you realize that taxes overall are at their  lowest rate since the 1950s.  Oh, are they really?  Absolutely.  Yeah, great.  Sure.  Sure they are.  Overall?  Yeah, and also one-third of the $862 billion stimulus went to tax cuts. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, did it?  Yeah.  To who, ass fuck?  To who?  They're...  You're using statistics that suck.  They're not taxing people that fucking, yeah, sit there and grind off the system.  Go fuck your mother, Eddie.  Well, honestly, Anthony, if you realize that about the...  You're taxing the people that give out jobs.  That's what he's doing. 
[00:52:00]  You're taxing the rich people.  I want to assure this is go fuck your mother, Eddie.  I will not say, you know what, they call it taxing the rich because it fucking, it makes  it sound better to the 98% of the country that are bleaching off of 2%.  That's what it makes it sound better.  You're taxing the rich, well, fuck, yeah.  They're the ones employing everybody, Eddie.  What's a percentage of Americans that are going to be affected by the estate tax this year?  11!  This year? 
[00:52:30]  Mm-hmm.  None.  Next year?  Everyone that dies.  That's over a million bucks.  And?  And what?  Well, like I said, I mean, people are talking about taxes growing higher, socialism.  Do you really think Obama's a socialist?  I mean...  Yes!  Abso-fucking-lutely!  And the reason there isn't an estate tax is because of Bush, dummy!  Not Obama!  Shithead!  Obama's putting it back in place!  Asshole!  I sort of think that Obama's leaning towards socialism as well, Eddie. 
[00:53:00]  He certainly is.  Just stop it.  But I still hate both sides.  Right?  Go gig!  You still got your Obama sticker on your car, you dunce!  I actually voted for Nader.  Oh, good.  I wouldn't say that Obama...  A lot of good that did.  Oh, I thought...  So you're saying you voted for Obama?  See, that's what happens.  Oh, Nader!  I'm just saying, Anthony, respectfully, sir.  I love the show.  I honestly think that most people who consider themselves far left, they're repulsed by Obama.  I mean, he's not really pushing a far left agenda at all.  He's very...  I mean, take a look...  Because he's fucking... 
[00:53:30]  He did, especially right when he came on board, and he realizes that a lot of people are not fucking seeing it his way.  His poll numbers are down.  Other Democrats are trying to distance themselves before November, because they know that it's going to be a housecleaning.  Can we disagree on one thing?  Basically, the whole political system is run by corporations and big money.  Man!  Seriously, I mean, you can patronize me all you want, gentlemen, but if Obama was really trying to kick the corporate monkey off the country's back, what's the first thing he should have done? 
[00:54:00]  Put a fucking cap on credit card interest.  That's one thing that's choking the life out of people.  Fucking for-profit universities.  The next great financial thing in the country is going to be the student loan default, but they don't seem to give a fuck about that.  How about we let some people pay taxes that aren't paying taxes right now, but are making money?  Keep going.  Even a little bit.  How about we fucking...  We don't have 50% of this country not even pay taxes.  How is that fucking fair that 50% of the country doesn't even pay fucking taxes at all? 
[00:54:30]  Thank you.  Wow, you shut up, Eddie.  Oh, Eddie.  All right.  Student loans, huh, Eddie?  Absolutely.  I mean, there's a lot of kids that are coming out of universities right now, and they can't find a fucking job.  You know what?  We've got to get the word out that college is a complete waste of time.  You know, honestly...  And I'm serious.  So is high school.  I was having this discussion with Brother Weez, and he completely agrees with us up there in Rochester.  College is a waste of time for most people. 
[00:55:00]  And not only is it a waste of time, you leave college, in some cases, you're $100,000 in debt.  That's nice.  You're way the fuck behind people that don't go to college.  You know, the interesting thing is, if you look at the small print in some of these student loan things, there are companies that will actually charge you $30,000 to $50,000 fee if you default on your student loan.  Fee?  I need the principal, Wade.  People are getting their fucking lives destroyed.  I mean, I went to very respectful, you know, I mean, respected top ten private university. 
[00:55:30]  I'm getting my master's at Harvard right now.  And most of the kids around me, the ones that are spending like $150,000, $160,000 to study fucking art history...  What are you getting your...  Sorry to interrupt you.  What are you getting your master's at Harvard?  That's pretty impressive.  Economics.  Most of these people are going to...  Oh, and you're arguing with them, Anthony?  Eh, what do I know?  Most of these people...  No, listen, honestly, I can understand your frustration, because, you know, I'm a small business owner.  I don't want to talk about what business I'm in, basically.  But, you know, I mean, nobody likes paying taxes.  But I think the problem is not the taxes, it's just the way they're being spent.  I think if Americans felt like they were getting more for what they paid, they wouldn't have as much of a problem with it. 
[00:56:00]  It's every time I turn around, there's another hand going in my fucking pocket, is what I'm saying.  And this isn't something that they're teaching you in economics in Harvard.  I'm living this shit.  I understand what it's like to make money, to fucking make a success out of yourself in this country,  and then be vilified for it, be taxed up the ass for it after they manipulate it so you look like the bad fucking guy in this country. 
[00:56:30]  And all you've done is achieved what is supposed to be the American dream, and they fucking penalize you for it,  grab as much money as they can from you, and then continue to fuck you.  Over and over.  I'm telling you, it's amazing that more people in the country don't take the frustration and channel it into something productive.  Well, you know, the Tea Party movement is now also being made into villains because they're being portrayed as racist. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, they are.  And it's very convenient before November.  Oh, and the liberal fucking protesters were just the best people ever when Bush was in, with the Hitler-Bush fucking effigies,  and the second you put a Hitler mustache on fucking Obama, you're part of the Klan.  It's just a load of shit.  Well, I mean, you're not really going to...  Did you have a bad weekend?  No, I had a great weekend.  You're not going to really convince me on that because I think Bush is a war criminal who belongs in jail. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, shit.  Oh, man, I go to Harvard and Bush, Bush.  But enough of Bush being a war criminal.  Can I ask any of your questions?  Fucking, fucking, okay, Bush is a war criminal.  Obama is a criminal to his country.  He's a fucking traitor.  He's a traitor to his own country.  Right here.  If you look at the difference between Obama and Bush, it's really not that much.  He's continuing the fucking bullshit in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Of course he is.  He's not doing anything to knock the corporations off the American people.  I can't remember the last time I heard somebody talk about something that would make a net impact on the country.  Like, repealing the Electoral College, taking care of the fucking credit card companies. 
[00:58:00]  Goddamn college ain't got nothing to do with it.  Public financing of elections?  I mean, that's the number one...  The guy has been in bed.  The guy is a great campaigner.  And now it's coming out that he's been in bed with all these companies anyway.  So who's he going to call out on the carpet, please?  They all are, man.  I mean, fucking Nader owned all that automotive stock when he was taking these companies to task.  They're all hypocrites.  It is weird, like, every one of them.  Like, this goes across racial...  Like, whenever black people complain that they're targeting Charlie Rangel for the... 
[00:58:30]  It's like, in politics...  For the corrupt fuck.  They're all dirtbags.  Yes.  It's like Charlie Rangel, John Edwards, across the board, with very few...  But Rangel can play the race card.  He can.  Yeah.  But to me, it's just...  You know who's not a piece of shit, believe it or not?  A guy like Jimmy Carter, and believe me, way too liberal.  But to me, he's not a sleazebag.  Like, he's one of the few that's not a sleazebag.  You know who's a...  You think he actually...  I think his intentions were good.  I really believe him, yeah.  And his execution sucked. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Worst execution ever?  Yeah.  One of the worst.  Yeah.  One of the worst presidents ever.  If you look back on Carter, a lot of the shit that he was talking about, giving addresses  to the American public about, you know, over-consumerism and not respecting money, and especially  the push toward green energy.  This man was clairvoyant in a lot of issues.  And also, the bullshit about...  Not about his brother's liver.  Oops.  Is his brother still alive?  He's dead!  He was very badly raped, you see?  Try the wine. 
[00:59:30]  By a Michelobottle.  Try the Billy beer.  Oh, fuck.  It was Billy beer, right?  What I'm saying is, the myth that the day that Reagan came in, that all those hostages  got freed...  What?  ...there was a lot of work that Carter did behind  the scenes that led to that shit happening.  Yeah, but they did that on purpose to make Carter kind of look like the castrated ass  he was.  Also, the American military was decimated during the Carter administration, and it was during  a time where we really needed to be strong.  Reagan came back in, brought the military and America as a superpower back, and wound up 
[01:00:00]  outbidding the Ruskis and pretty much winning the Cold War, for good or bad.  I think a lot of people could argue that, but I think Carter was a horrible president to have  at that time.  And you can't let him off the hook for the hostages being released.  Maybe he worked behind the scenes.  That was a complete answer, right?  A hundred percent slap in the face to Carter.  That's because he gave a sanction to the Shah.  Because he kept the Shah, there's nothing he could have done to get those hostages freed. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, absolutely.  And I mean, you know, I think one point I'd like to make, honestly, about politics in  general, U.S. foreign policy, it has been so fucked up, probably ever since Truman was  president, that it's amazing that more people don't hate us.  I mean, I'm not saying that I agree with countries that are anti-American.  I would never believe in anti-Americanism at all, but we kick ourselves in the ass real  hard.  You know what, some of you motherfuckers, you look at things based on today.  Everyone looks at history based on today's ideology. 
[01:01:00]  I was having a conversation with somebody about how we treated certain people in the  past, American Indians, black people as slaves, and not even us just as Americans, but the  whole world.  You look at things as if we look at it today.  If you found out, let's say, ants, fucking ants, were the smartest fucking things on this  planet, smarter than we are, and then finally figured out a way to communicate with them  and realized, wow, they're fucking smart. 
[01:01:30]  Do you think in 500 years from now, they'd still be telling stories about how we sprayed  poison on them and killed them?  It's like there was a time in history where these people weren't considered humans.  And do you think that it's a cool...  It's true!  No, but don't...  But it's true!  The question is, hold on, does anybody think...  I just have never heard it said...  Did you drop acid this morning?  Does anybody...  No, I'd say it's me!  I just never heard it said in mainstream media.  Does anybody think it's a coincidence or a Freudian slip that ant said that ants are the smartest 
[01:02:00]  thing on the planet?  Ants!  Ants!  Or is that the ramblings of a psychopath?  I'm just saying that...  How would you fucking ant?  The context...  Say my fucking uncle.  You have to remember the context of time.  Yeah.  So when you look at American foreign policy after World War II, during the Cold War, now  it seems very fucking paranoid and that we made some dumb moves.  But during that time, there was reason to be paranoid. 
[01:02:30]  Fucking the Soviet Union was scooping up everything left over after World War II.  And we had to get in there and do something about it.  Southeast Asia.  You don't think we looked at what happened in Europe after World War II and thought they  weren't going to come into Korea and Vietnam and then South America, the same thing?  We went in there and did that because of what history showed us. 
[01:03:00]  I'm still waiting for you to make a point.  Holy fuck!  Oh, shit!  I just made a valid point about our foreign policy and that it's based on what's happening  at the moment and you can't look back in hindsight without realizing where we were at the time.  That's a damn good point.  What am I, you professor?  I'm a dumb dropout!  You can look back and learn and that's what we should do.  Look back and learn we have.  Do you think we're the same type of country doing the same things that we were many years 
[01:03:30]  ago, especially post-World War II?  You believe this Nazi shit that's going on right now in the name of America is actually  going to help us have a positive image?  All right.  What Nazi shit, by the way?  Oh, my God.  Iraq and Afghanistan?  Why don't you go back and look at...  How is that Nazi shit, by the way?  Why don't you go back and look at the deals that the United States government made with  Saddam Hussein?  I understand.  I know that.  We had to.  We didn't like Iran and they were at war with Iran.  So who are we going to back?  Look at...  We dropped bombs on Japan and half the shit I'm staring at in this studio is made there. 
[01:04:00]  Anthony, realistically...  Again, to take the context of time.  How in the fuck could a ricky-tick little country like Iran ever pose a threat to American  democracy?  You go in, you knock them over.  See, this is my one problem.  If you have these false hawks on the conservative side, you want to go and fucking clean people  out?  Go clean them out.  Otherwise, don't complain about it.  Believe me.  No one's ever going to stop the United States.  We got a more dynamic economy.  We got the best fucking military.  All these little tin-pot dictators don't mean shit to me.  Worry about America first. 
[01:04:30]  Build the country up.  Stay away from foreign entanglement.  You just completely...  Didn't you totally just contradict yourself?  Fuck no, I didn't.  I'm saying, if you're going to go into another man's country, don't be surprised when shit  goes wrong.  You're probably better off staying out.  Oil?  We should have been past oil.  I understood that.  But, and believe me, I'm not a big fan of the Iraq war, but Afghanistan, you don't  think that, especially, again, context of time, right after 9-11, that this entire country  wasn't behind Bush going into Afghanistan? 
[01:05:00]  Just because the entire country was behind it doesn't make it right.  And don't you think that the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and being known to be in Afghanistan, it wasn't  a good move to show them a little something?  You know, it might have been a good move to pump some cruise missiles over there, but  as far as going and occupying...  Oh, like Clinton did, with zero effectiveness.  Exactly.  None of it's going to have any effect, because that's the fucking graveyard of empires.  I understand.  Afghanistan has been a tough nut over the years. 
[01:05:30]  But you know what?  If you can keep the Taliban and Al-Qaeda down so they can't really organize, sometimes it's  very hard to see an endgame there.  I understand that.  You're not going to fucking change that country.  It's a savage nation of fucking savage people.  But what are we supposed to do?  Just let them regroup so they can bomb the shit out of us again?  People are going to be able to...  Terrorists are going to be able to hit us anytime they want, anywhere they want. 
[01:06:00]  This is not something that you can stop with military.  This is a police thing.  I'm not going to say you're going to win hearts and minds in that part of the world,  because a lot of those people, frankly, are fucking insane.  But no, launching a war over there, I don't believe...  So you don't think Israel has done a good job with their military keeping their whole country  from just being wiped off the face of the earth, surrounded by Arab nations?  I mean, I'm Jewish, but I've never been a Zionist.  I really don't understand the Zionist impulse, and I think those people are suicidal.  I don't want to get into that debate.  I'm just saying, that's the way they feel. 
[01:06:30]  They use the military, and at the drop of a hat, at the drop of a yarmulke,  those motherfuckers will bomb the shit out of a threat,  and it's done them well, that policy, over the years.  Well, I mean, I'm sure to some extent it has,  but realistically, when you have a country this size, not one the size of Israel,  it takes on a whole new meaning when you're worried about battling terrorism.  All right, Eddie.  Thank you.  Eddie, good luck in school, my friend.  Thanks.  He's in Harvard.  I didn't go to Harvard. 
[01:07:00]  This is the beauty of what just happened.  Velvet fan, there's two eyes to a few backs, so don't get mad by the first one.  And is brainwashed by Fox.  And then the next one goes, Frank in Jersey,  if I want to listen to liberal assholes, I would go stand under a window at the NYU dorms  and listen to them hit the sidewalk.  I love how I'm...  That's funny.  That is a good one.  If I was brainwashed by Fox, you know something?  You're an asshole.  Go fuck yourself, liberal cunt.  Oh, shit.  Let's say hi to Clarence in Alabama. 
[01:07:30]  Brainwashed by myself.  Clarence.  Yeah.  Anthony, it wouldn't matter who was in there.  You're going to be bitter and angry for the rest of your life.  And I don't understand it because you're rich.  I don't ever want to be rich.  I don't ever want to be rich.  Yes, you do, sir.  Yeah, I think everybody wants to be rich.  Look, I'm happy, man.  That's pretty much the American dream, right?  I drive a truck and go fishing.  Why are you so angry?  I'm angry because I don't like all of my money going to the government. 
[01:08:00]  I really don't like it.  I earn it.  I earn it.  I don't want...  What?  What percentage goes to the government?  Federal alone is 30...  Going to be, what, 38%?  39.  39.  And then state...  I'm not going to get into numbers.  It's a lot.  It's a lot of fucking money.  I'm in bed with the government at a rate higher than 50%.  And then my taxed money gets taxed whenever I pull it out of my pocket to use it.  So what the fuck are you talking about? 
[01:08:30]  Well, didn't you think the other guy made a lot of good points about the foreign policy  and the way this government works?  We've made our own damn bed and we've got to sleep in it.  No, because he wasn't listening to my point on context and time.  That we do things based on the best interests, for the most part, of our country at the time.  Some things look stupid in hindsight, but at the time you can't fucking see the future  to know that whatever you're doing is going to fuck shit up.  Well, look at your Ann analogy.  Wouldn't ants be socialists? 
[01:09:00]  They're working for a common goal.  Exactly, see?  All I'm saying is I use the most simple analogy I could.  You take an ant and realize 500 years from now that it is indeed an intelligent being  and then you realize you were spraying poison all over the fucking things.  And then they'd be kind of angry with you.  That was my point.  Anthony, you're a talented, funny guy, but I just worry about you sometimes because you just seem like...  Don't worry about me!  You know?  Traffic, politics, blacks, everything is to you. 
[01:09:30]  I don't understand.  I have fun, believe me.  Once I fucking stop talking to motherfuckers like you, I'm a pisser.  I do have a lot of anger, sir.  Well, I fought in a liberal fight down here in Alabama.  Wow.  I know with that accent, hearing liberal shit is a little amazing to me, but okay.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  I'm believing God, man.  My friend.  We had a lot of guys on hold, they went away talking about the college thing and what a scam it is. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And how much fucking money they're in debt and they can't find a good job.  And then someone else says, well, if you don't go to college, then you don't even have a chance of getting a good job.  So it's a whole fucking...  It's just a scam.  That's not true, though.  What do you mean?  That's just not true.  Well, we're in a weird place because of what we chose to do for a living.  I never had a proof to anyone I actually graduated college.  But I guess in other jobs, you have to.  You know what?  In other jobs, I don't think you do either.  I mean...  Not in every job.  I know you can't become a fucking surgeon if you don't have that. 
[01:10:30]  But there are other things that I think networking and working your way up in a company is more important than a degree.  It's hard to sneak some of this shit past future employers, too.  I'm not even talking about sneaking shit past.  But I mean, you can't...  I'm sure there's a bunch of people that are a little older that went into jobs and said,  oh, yeah, I graduated college, and they never did the background check.  But it's a lot easier to do the background check now.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I'm not even talking about lying.  I'm just talking about working your way up in a company.  That whole concept is gone. 
[01:11:00]  My brother...  I mean, Bear Stearns went away, but my brother started in the mailroom.  That old gag, but really started in the mailroom and became one of their big fucking guys.  Well, some people get out of college now and just want to be the fucking vice versa.  He's president in charge of something.  But he did what you just said.  He worked his way up through the company.  They actually wrote an article on him and what a success story he was for the company.  And then he got, you know, yanked with the rest of the Wall Street guys.  Of course.  Great time.  But actually, he's doing better not working for anybody. 
[01:11:30]  All on the up and up.  That's good.  Yeah, so college is a fucking joke for most people.  A joke.  Yeah.  How do you pay back $200,000 in student loans?  How many years will that take?  I get to fault on it.  Do you remember our old intern, Cream Pie Jones?  Yes, good old Cream Pie.  Cream Pie Jones was like...  He was like $80,000 or $90,000 in debt to Syracuse, and he was working at a Spencer Gifts.  And that's...  Holy shit, he's selling glow-in-the-dark posters and fucking dildo mugs. 
[01:12:00]  He's selling lava lamps and picking up Jimmy's diarrhea out of the toilet.  And plastic puke.  Let's not forget the plastic puke.  Yes.  That's a good one you could get over there.  Oh, you love it.  Rubber dog shit.  But that's a lot of people.  You just explained a lot of people.  God.  What?  No, it's one of the things.  Oh, shit.  I'm not even kidding.  I'm just being, you know...  Yeah.  Just being, you know...  I'm a robot worker. 
[01:12:30]  It's good.  What's that?  What?  Upbeat Chip?  Upbeat Chip.  Serious Chip.  Trying to get in on an issue.  I'm just saying there's been rumors that Chip's been trying to be upbeat.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Rumors?  Whatever.  Wasn't he upbeat to begin with?  Oh, yeah.  But I'm the same.  We were upbeat.  Oh, the new voice.  You know, whatever.  God.  Chip wasn't annoying enough, is what I'm saying.  Or thinking.  And somebody had to make it more annoying for someone else.  Maybe last night in the supermarket while shopping, somebody was getting very annoyed 
[01:13:00]  while we were looking for frozen food.  And Upbeat Chip kept going, you know what?  It seems like it'd be really nice to have some odd things.  You want to get it?  That looks good to me.  It's up to you.  Oh, God.  How did she not just kill you?  She despises Upbeat Chip.  Let's say hi to Tom.  Tom, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Later, Tom.  Hey, Buzz.  Hey, I was saying you're kind of against Obama and all that.  I mean, I figured Ant would want to look up Reverend James Manning on YouTube. 
[01:13:30]  He's got kind of a rant against, well, he's kind of for the white people, but he's against  Obama on a few things.  It's, um, I forget what it's under, though.  Jesus.  Again.  I'm not a loser.  The wheels are falling off.  He's falling off, sir.  You're sliding on your axles.  That's a good call, though.  I mean, it's the guy who has some feelings about something.  It's fine.  We'll look for that.  Brian in Pennsylvania. 
[01:14:00]  Brian.  What's going on, guys?  Yeah, it sounds like Leno.  You're right.  Brian.  Oh, does it sound like Leno?  A little bit, yes.  I don't know.  He's rich.  I'm not.  Same old Chip.  Brian.  Yeah, you sound a little upset, buddy.  Huh?  I just wanted to, yeah, people are upset with you.  You're upset with them.  I just wanted to thank you, because you work so hard, and you pay all those taxes for me.  Yeah, I know.  You don't have to, you know?  I know.  Yeah, I'm happy to do it.  Just damn happy to do it.  Love you.  Holy man, no.  Oh, it's, it's, what am I going to do? 
[01:14:30]  Whatever.  Whatever.  I'm never going to be able to sell my point, because people just go, well, if you didn't  have it, you wouldn't have to pay it, and that's a good thing.  It's like, yeah, all right, you're right.  I live all comfortably and stuff, so just keep taking and taking until I don't.  It sucks for everybody.  Until I'm broke.  It's all relative, man.  Nah, it doesn't suck for everybody.  You start to resent.  There's some people that don't pay anything.  You start to resent that they're just taking your money, though.  It's not a matter of being greedy, and it's not a matter of not wanting to pay my share.  There's a certain entitlement they have to just taking from you, and you know they're 
[01:15:00]  making up for their own mishandling.  Eddie was right.  If I saw my money going to things, and I really saw things changing, I don't mind paying,  but I know it's just more waste, and it's just more of them trying to appease their  constituency with my money, and I resent it for that reason.  I'm not selfish.  I'm not greedy, but I work really fucking hard, and I resent them jamming their hands  further into my pockets to make up for their own mishandling of money. 
[01:15:30]  Exactly.  What the hell were we reading the other day?  $600 and some odd thousand dollars in a congressional budget for bottled water?  I mean, can you maybe figure out a way to knock that number down a little bit?  Congress is a group of the biggest criminals on both sides.  Believe me, I'm not going Republican or Democrat on this one.  Wait, wait, but bottled water for them?  Yeah, yeah.  How about you buy your own fucking bottled water, best healthcare?  Yeah.  Cocksuckers?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:16:00]  I've got to buy my own bottled fucking water.  And then you find out that they're just, they're using, like Rangel, just using his office as  his own little fucking playground, whatever he wants to buy or finagle out of people.  And then he gets on TV saying he's innocent to this shit.  Good, good.  Don't fucking retire.  Don't fucking resign, I mean.  Just sit there, and I want to see, I want everything to come out.  And this fucking guy will sit there. 
[01:16:30]  People will be going, could you please just fucking resign?  Because this is going to be really embarrassing for you.  I'm not going to resign.  I'm going to stay in office.  But wasn't Governor Patterson supposed to kind of step away?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What happened with that?  He just said, fuck you.  He said, fuck you to everybody, and they said, oh, okay, and everyone went away.  Fuck you.  And he's still in there.  We should take a little break.  When we get back, we got the Comic-Con audio.  Jim Norton and Sam went out to San Diego, so I want to get into that audio. 
[01:17:00]  I hear that.  I hear it's some great audio.  Also, Sandy Kane is coming in today, and Jimmy, you missed it on Friday or Thursday of last week.  We're going to try to make Sandy Kane look as young as possible.  Cool, and then she's going to pull a penny from 1979 out of her pocket and realize the  whole thing was a big mistake.  We're going with the whole Britney Spears look.  Yeah, little Catholic schoolgirl, the white shirt tied up in a little halter top type thing, 
[01:17:30]  and ponytails, and that smoky eye makeup, and shit like that, you know.  She's going to look more like Aerie Spears.  I'm going to give it a shot, a little side bit we're doing today.  And Jim Florentine's stopping in at 8.30 to say hi.  Oh, cool.  Nice.  So lots of show to do.  The 4B and Anthony Show on the virus.  This is excellent. 
[01:18:00]  I want to wish a speedy recovery.  It's Kings of Leon.  They had a little problem on a concert stage, and I hope the boys are okay.  We were talking about Mick Jagger, what, 67 years old today?  You think he stopped the show because he had pigeon poop land on his head?  Pigeon shit. 
[01:18:30]  Apparently, in a lot of pigeon shit.  Well, you play through the fucking show and deal with the pigeon shit.  People came there to see you.  I think it was like a bad slapstick movie amount of pigeon shit.  Are you defending Kings of Leon for canceling a show after three songs because they got some fucking bird poop on him?  I'd have loved to have seen it.  It went in the bassist's mouth.  Oh, well.  At least we'll see if that bird flu is for real or not. 
[01:19:00]  That's good stuff.  Are you defending Kings of Leon, Travis?  Well, I don't know.  I don't know how much bird shit it was.  Our rock stars, man, would have dealt with it.  From what I heard, it was a lot of bird shit.  You're a rock star.  You deal with it.  It's a tough call.  What do you mean it's a tough call?  I don't know what I would do if I was in that position.  They're getting paid a lot of money, though, so I might have to put up with it.  Grammy-winning U.S. rock band Kings of Leon cut short their concert last night in St. Louis  after a pigeon dropping landed in bassist Jared's mouth. 
[01:19:30]  The band walked off stage at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater after playing just three songs.  It's the bassist.  Tell them to fucking beat it and then you guys continue.  Lucky it's not human shit.  The house lights came on a few minutes later and a venue employee announced that due to  concerns over the band's safety, we are canceling the show.  It was fucking faggots.  Our rock fucking stars never did this.  They probably were a little scared.  Please file out in an orderly fashion.  I think during the Rolling Stones concert where one fucking concert goer got stabbed to death, 
[01:20:00]  I do believe they finished the concert.  The guy died.  Didn't they finish the concert, Anthony?  Yes, really?  How about you get more hats?  I don't know, for real.  Wear hats, you faggots.  It's bird shit.  They're not pterodactyls.  I think they're afraid of that bird flu thing.  Well, the funny thing is the birds hate bassists because the opening band, their bassist, was  also hit with bird droppings.  Really?  They're attacking the bassists of these bands.  A lot of fucking birds.  But isn't that what you'd love to do to somebody playing loud music?  Just drop shit on them? 
[01:20:30]  How much it's great to be a bird?  But the opening band finished their set, even though they got fucking hit with some bird  They're the opening band.  They're just happy to be there.  Who's defending Kings of Leon?  You are?  No, I can give a shit.  Good.  Ha ha.  Say, pun.  I'm being punny.  And, you know, what a coinkydink.  I bring up that goddamn dengue fever thing.  Dengue.  And it seems in Florida there's a few cases of it.  Now they're saying they want people that have it to not go around where there's mosquitoes. 
[01:21:00]  It's like a little fishy, this whole thing.  They say, oh, mosquitoes, they can't really just pass it from one person to another.  But they could get it in their system to the point where they could start passing.  It was all very vague.  Because I hate the commercials.  I was talking about that Asian woman.  She's like, I have a dengue fever and my joints hurt very much.  And I listen on the news and go, I go, what is this?  Who gets dengue fever?  We should not be talking about this in the United States. 
[01:21:30]  But they said a lot of the cases are from people outside of the country.  You know what I mean?  Yes, if you know what I mean.  But a couple of cases are reported in Florida.  But how do you stay away from mosquitoes, especially in Florida?  How are you supposed to stay away from the mosquitoes?  That's the biggest scary monster thing that they tell you.  It's like, watch out for mosquito bites.  I got bit 8,000 times already.  That hurt your joints.  That's what dengue was supposed to make them feel better. 
[01:22:00]  No, that's bengue.  Oh, silly chip.  I wish them all you well.  I hope they do okay.  Bing up, beep.  We got Comic-Con audio for everybody.  Oh, thank God.  We have a lot of tracks.  And we got a very busy show.  So we might have to break this up during the week.  Is that okay?  I think we should.  All right.  What?  We'll see how far we can get into this.  The, uh...  Jim Norton's Comic-Con experience.  The hotel restaurant got to know Chip, too.  Did they?  Oh, yeah.  You guys went out to dinner? 
[01:22:30]  Well, we had lunch before Comic-Con.  Because the room service shut down.  It was like one of those places where they have breakfast and 5 to 11, and then you're fucked.  I hate that.  Me, too.  That's so dumb.  My favorite funny observation that Chip had was we went into the hotel restaurant, and  Chip said, it's actually funny.  Yesterday, we sat over at that table.  To the lady.  Oh, oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  She didn't think it was funny.  Oh.  Oh.  He was like, you know what's really funny?  Yesterday, we were sitting over at that table, you know? 
[01:23:00]  That seems kind of funny, though.  Got a zero.  It did.  Yeah.  She didn't find Chip amusing.  Oh.  All right.  So, how do we start this?  Any setups?  Well, I mean...  Just go with the tracks?  Yeah.  It's kind of...  We started on, I think, the Comic-Con floor, because by the time we found parking, we weren't  able to interview Bruce Campbell, which was our first...  Oh, that's right.  We missed the Bruce Campbell interview.  Now, he's somebody that perhaps we would want to...  Right. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Well, instead, you talked to the Green Hornet girls.  Yeah, they were promoting the Green Hornet, and they were wearing, like, little short  skirts so that...  So, they're going to be in the movie?  No.  Oh.  Oh.  Quickly, before I think...  I said we talked to them.  Wow.  Did someone pull that audio from Tommy?  Oh, yeah.  Tommy, can you hear me?  All right.  I want to hear that.  Supposedly, Ant's ex said shit on the air by accident.  Jill slipped the S-bomb out.  Oh, really?  That's what we're hearing.  Was it just now?  God, I hope they fire her.  Be nice now. 
[01:24:00]  I love Jill.  So, I just hope she gets fired for it, though.  Why?  Oh, my God.  We've got to make an example of these people.  No, they ruled that you could slip the fucking...  That's right.  You could slip the shit and the fucking fuck...  Jill's smart enough to know.  ...thing like that.  She could get away with it now.  Yeah.  Maybe she was talking about the Kings of Leon story.  And say, you know, there was bird shit coming down in the base player's mouth.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  You continue the show.  That's embarrassing.  It really is, though. 
[01:24:30]  It really is embarrassing.  You fucking wash your mouth out.  Wash it out.  Get some Listerine.  You play some weird fucking guitar solo.  Let the basses wash his mouth out.  And then you continue.  Do you think he was able to...  People came there to see you.  Keep the bass line going?  Or do you think he just freaked out and...  Oh, God.  Like, spitting out and just going crazy.  Travis, are they known to be pussies or what?  Just Kings of Leon.  Well, I mean, they're on Alt Nation, so...  You know.  Fucking douchebags.  How hard rock rock stars can they be? 
[01:25:00]  You picture fucking Ozzy walking out of a concert with his bird shit on him?  Thank you.  He snorted.  He snorted.  Ozzy's easy.  You could say someone like Boy George would fucking take bird poop in his mouth.  No problem.  Troy's telling me that Kings of Leon started out as a Christian band.  Well, good for them.  Good.  That's how God feels about them.  Have some bird shit, faggots.  Eat this.  Fucking nerds.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mikey.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[01:25:30]  What's up, man?  The same thing happened to Cyndi Lauper.  She was doing a concert and a bird shit in her mouth.  It's on YouTube.  Yeah.  Did she run off stage and cancel the show?  No, I think she kept on singing.  Yeah, man.  Our rock stars or the rock stars of the youth of America, they suck.  Yep.  J.D. in New York City.  Keith fucking Moon keeled over on the drums in San Francisco in 1973, and the Who got a  drummer from the audience and played half a dozen more songs before finally canceling 
[01:26:00]  the show.  Ah, the old days.  That's why I'm bringing this shit up.  There's a million stories of things happening to bands, and they continued.  A little bird poo stops your fucking band?  It's bird shit, though.  You don't want that in your mouth.  Oh, go fuck yourself.  Later, boys.  All right.  Keith Moon keels over.  They don't even know if he's alive.  Just kick him off the stool and get some guy from the audience.  Right.  Yeah, I know you, music man.  All right, get up here. 
[01:26:30]  All right, Comic-Con.  So you guys talked to the Green Hornet girls who are not going to be in the movie.  Yeah, we figured we would interview some people on the floor of the con.  So you guys went to a Halloween party, basically, over the weekend.  It was a big Halloween party.  Big Halloween party.  So they were in costume?  Yes, they were.  In what?  In costume.  Costume.  Why do you say it that way?  That's how it's said.  In some places.  Yes, in Retardville. 
[01:27:00]  Retardville.  I want to drive through there.  I want you to work here.  I'm just kidding.  Everybody's really doing a good job.  Did you guys bond on the road?  Yeah, we had fun.  Yeah, we had a good time.  Did Jimmy get you a tranny or anything?  No.  Not this time.  No.  Not this time?  Maybe next time.  And not first trip.  Not first trip.  No big secrets.  First trip.  I kept suggesting that we checked into places and made love, though.  Like, look, let's go get lunch and we'll check into somewhere and make love and go get an interview. 
[01:27:30]  Check in and make love.  I was also referred to as she, no matter where we went.  Oh, really?  To whoever.  Everywhere we went.  Oh, no.  You said that to people, right?  Even out of context.  Like, even if I hadn't said anything, you'd say, how far away is the airport?  And they'd say, it's about 15 minutes.  And he hadn't even asked me how far away the airport was.  But he would insist on saying, oh, she said it was further.  I don't know.  Shit.  Or we'd sit down and be like, hey, listen, I'm going to have steak gum.  I think she's ready, too.  And they would a lot of times look.  Yeah.  They'd look at me to see if I'm laughing, and I never was. 
[01:28:00]  Holy shit.  They were just confused.  That is great, man.  Yeah, it was really uncomfortable.  That is good.  Right on.  Who called one person goes, she?  Who finally said she?  The bike girl.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  What?  Ooh.  We got a pedicab ride.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I think there's a scam in San Diego, because at night, all these fucking smoking hot Russian  chicks do their pedicabs. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, fuck.  What a scam.  I don't know if they're hookers or not.  They might just be hot chicks who make, because they know you're going to tip them.  I'm sure people are listening.  Dude.  They might not technically be the hooker.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, they might bring you somewhere.  Hot Russian broad, and then go, eh.  Hot Russian broad's got to be the hooker.  It looks like it's a friend.  Oh, maybe.  Dude, this one, her little ass popped out.  It was so sexy, looking at her little ass.  But she actually called me out on she.  But me and Sam were walking the next night, and this one Russian girl in little satin shorts 
[01:29:00]  was sitting there.  And she's like, do you guys need a ride?  And as we're talking, her pussy popped out of the side of her shorts.  No, it didn't.  Yes.  Dude, not her whole pussy, but just the fat little lip.  I was out of my mind.  You must have gone crazy.  Just enough to know it's pussy?  Yeah.  She actually, I was talking to her, like, literally, I was answering her questions.  She's like, do you guys need a ride?  I'm like, no, we're just looking.  And the fucking twat popped out.  This is a crowded street.  And I'm just sitting there, and my eyes went to it.  And she kind of covered it. 
[01:29:30]  So I was like, I felt kind of creepy staring at her cunt.  You didn't give it a hootily-hoo?  I wanted to just go, like, oi-bidi-oi-bidi-oi-bidi with my finger.  But I wanted to be respectful of the girl.  You know, she's nice.  Yeah.  So I walked a horse.  Let's go to Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  Wow.  Yeah, hey.  How you doing, man?  Hey.  I'm obsessed with this Kings of Leon canceling show over a little bird poo.  And then we bring up the Keith Moon situation.  What do you got?  Yeah, man.  If you go on YouTube, you'll find there's actually footage of when they got the drummer to come  up on stage to replace me. 
[01:30:00]  He high-fives Pete Townsend when he gets behind the drums.  Yeah, they don't even think twice.  Wow, that's nice.  They just dragged Keith Moon off the stage.  But, like, whatever became of that guy?  I don't know, man.  Does he just have a great story?  Or is it like, wow, I...  Yeah, where is he now?  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  But he did a pretty damn good job.  He knew all the stuff.  He played.  He was great.  But no one sucks about stuff like that.  You know, while you're in the moment, this is going to be the greatest day of your life,  and it's never going to get better than this moment.  I'm never going to get a gig like this. 
[01:30:30]  He's playing with the fucking Who.  Or do you think he's...  You think he's thinking it's going to roll over into some other things?  Yeah, yeah, he's thinking like they're going to get tired.  Maybe ACDC will call him or something.  Keith Moon fucking passing out, so they'll replace me.  I'll be the new drummer of the Who.  He's just a guy with a story no one believes.  Right.  You're full of shit, Henry.  Probably goes to every Who show, hoping somehow they recognize him and relive the moment.  Hey, Mike.  Right on, brother. 
[01:31:00]  Let's go to Chris the teacher on Long Island.  Chris, what do you teach?  Hey, fellas, I teach a little social studies, history, like all the stuff that already happened.  The new stuff or...  Yeah, is it old history or new history?  Oh, I mean revisionist or the real stuff?  Uh, no, not the real stuff, unfortunately.  Yeah, yeah, you got to make it all nice and cuddly and cozy, don't you?  Yeah, we tried to get him to read some Howard Zinn, which I'm sure you've read, and it didn't work out so good.  No, I've burnt a few of those in my yard.  So anyway, I was at San Diego about a month ago for a Met game, because I'm a zero. 
[01:31:30]  No, you weren't.  Okay.  And Jimmy, this chick in white little short shorts.  Down by that street where all the water is on San Diego, by all the Navy ships.  We took a ride from her to get back closer to where our hotel was, and she gets up, and she's like standing up on the bike,  and she's like sticking her ass back in me and my boy's face, like I was pretty excited about it.  And then she drives us like five blocks past where we're supposed to be, and she starts asking us what else would we be interested in. 
[01:32:00]  There you go.  I wonder one of two things, because we took the...  It has to be.  It has to be.  We only took the one ride from the one girl.  The other ones we just kind of ogled.  You should have tested out another one, though, to see if it was just...  Well, the one girl who called me over and went and talked to me, here's what I think it is.  They might be doing more, but it just seems if they were actually hooking, it would be way too easy to bust them all. 
[01:32:30]  But the one girl dropped us off like a block shy.  She's like, yeah, a lot of the girls are getting tickets.  I don't want to see any cops.  So she might have been...  Oh my God, that sounds like a...  She might have been a prostitute.  But again, she didn't say hooker things.  She was saying...  Oh, she said this to us as she's driving.  Oh yeah, guys, sometimes they tip $10, $80.  And then she was saying, one guy gave me $100 to go to breakfast with him.  But I don't know if she was actually a hooker or if she's just trying to jack you for tips. 
[01:33:00]  Because for them, it's easy money.  If they're driving a bunch of drunk guys five, six blocks and making a $70 tip,  I don't know if she was a whore or not.  And the streets around the bars literally get flooded with these girls driving pedicabs.  There were tons of them.  So you would think if they were prostitutes, they could get busted pretty easily.  It would be so easy.  She could probably pop a pussy lip out on command.  No, she covered it though.  But dude, this was a different one.  The one who actually rode with didn't pop a pussy lip on.  But the one with the satin shorts who did, I noticed that we were talking. 
[01:33:30]  Of course, I looked.  She covered it.  We were just going to Morton's to eat.  So, you know, it was a block away.  But she knew what she was doing.  I don't know if she meant it to be that obvious.  They gave you an oopsie, like, oops.  Yeah.  Jimmy, don't you just know?  Jimmy, don't you just like smell them and know?  Usually I have great instincts for that.  But with these girls, I couldn't tell.  Because I only talked to two of them.  The one who drove us and the other one.  And, like, yeah, you think they might be, but they also might just take you to strip clubs.  Or they might just take you like someone's, I think it was to take you somewhere else. 
[01:34:00]  I couldn't tell.  You should have got Sam a Russian fucking prostitute.  Oh, it rolls.  Let the Russian prostitute break Sam in half.  That's how you know I'm happy about my relationship.  I really didn't try to get a prostitute.  I'm ashamed of myself.  I'm embarrassed.  Went to Morton's with me instead.  I know, me and Sam went and had fucking filet mignon.  I'm a faggot.  The substitute drummer for Keith Moon.  He's dead.  He's dead.  Well, it was a Wikipedia on the guy.  Scott with one T.  Scott.  Halpin. 
[01:34:30]  H-A-L-P-I-N.  Yeah.  I want to know the story of Scott Halpin.  Yeah.  I thought there was video, no?  The guy's lying?  It was pulled.  It was pulled due to a copyright infringement.  Oh, God forbid.  Who copyrighted that?  Who the fuck is pulling that?  I have one last question for little Jimmy, if he has one second.  Okay.  Jimmy, I was in Amsterdam, and that was when I finally vowed off prostitution.  I don't know if you've ever been over there.  No.  But it was the most impersonal, awkward, terrible experience of my life. 
[01:35:00]  I don't know if this is what it's like altogether.  And, you know, you're...  Is he auto-tuned?  You heard that?  Yeah.  That was weird.  Like, you couldn't...  They really get you.  They know exactly what to say to get the extra money out of you.  And, you know, I walk in.  You know, my rod is leading me.  And I don't know.  They make me pay another 40 euros to, like, switch positions.  And then I was, like, leaning on her.  And she, like, told me not to lean on her.  And then some guy came out of the cupboard and, like, took me off her. 
[01:35:30]  Nothing?  No.  Nothing?  I'm listening to you, buddy.  I don't know.  It sounds very mechanical.  You stopped very abruptly.  It really happened.  It was just...  It was just the most terrible experience of my life because they walk you back and you  see the other guys in the room.  And sometimes there's just a shade and a pane of glass separating you from the street  and the red light district.  And, dude, it was like...  It was, like, American.  It was, like, $400.  What could I have gotten in New York?  I'm around.  What could I have gotten in New York?  $400.  Nice hooker. 
[01:36:00]  Mm-hmm.  Nice prostitute.  All right.  All right.  Well, thanks, guys.  I'm passionate about it.  All right.  I'm so glad the social studies teacher is getting...  Oh, yeah.  I forgot he was a teacher.  Oh, wow.  You know something?  I didn't even realize that.  Why don't you tell that story to your kids?  Teach them about Amsterdam.  Jim talks to the Green Hornet girls on the floor of Comic-Con.  All right.  We're standing here waiting for these three whores.  I love how you set the mood right out of the box. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  We're standing here waiting for these three whores in green.  They're wearing green hats promoting the Green Hornet, and they all have nice short skirts  on, kind of lickable rumps.  Everyone's taking pictures.  I'm like, they're fucking celebrities.  All right.  Let's go.  Okay.  Madam, can we interview you?  Miss, what are you guys doing?  We're interviewing you for the Opie and Anthony show.  What exactly are you doing, like, for this?  We're promoting for the Green Hornet, the movie, coming out on January 14th. 
[01:37:00]  Who's in that film?  Seth Rogen and Cameron Diaz.  Seth Rogen and Cameron Diaz.  Seth Rogen plays the Green Hornet.  Cameron Diaz is the secretary.  Isn't Seth Rogen a little fat to play the Green Hornet?  He looks great.  He is great.  He's got comedic value to it.  Sexy.  He's right up there.  He looks good behind the thing, but you can't see his gut.  I've met Seth before.  He's a little fat.  You have to go see the movie now.  You have to go see the movie.  So you're all dressed very sexually. 
[01:37:30]  Can we all take a photo together?  Nobody's going to believe this.  All right, hold on.  All right, hold on.  This is Anthony.  Yes.  Did I really get that right?  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Most people actually think that I'm Anthony because of my drinking problem, but no, I'm  Opie and that's Anthony.  You look like an Opie if I'm Anthony all the time, too.  Dummies.  Right on, man.  Adulty broads.  That's funny.  That was funny.  I forgot about the idiots. 
[01:38:00]  Sam doesn't eat steak, so what did he have in most?  Oh, that's right.  Chicken.  Chicken fingers.  He was very easy to eat with.  He just ordered chicken.  I had the chicken Christopher.  What is that?  I don't know.  It's just breaded chicken.  I just asked for it without the sauce.  Christopher.  It's like the chicken that you put on your dashboard.  For safe traffic.  I chipped it up in the middle.  Don't go to chipped at the end of that one.  Jim talks to someone dressed as Robin with his package prominently on display.  Dude, we saw this guy in Robin shorts, in Robin long, whatever, and his fucking, you 
[01:38:30]  can see his cock package from across the fucking, just waving back and forth as he walked.  Why?  Why did he do that?  Nothing constraining it.  The question is not why did he do it, it's why didn't we?  That's an important question.  Cock lump.  I wanted to interview him about his dick.  He's a fanboy, obviously.  Yeah.  We're interviewing people here.  Oh, cool.  What are you guys, what's your main reason for being here? 
[01:39:00]  Because we love...  Tradition.  Tradition.  And we love comic books, we love video games, we love television, we love cartoons and superheroes  and all that stuff.  Are you guys a couple?  No.  You're dressed as Robin from the Batman and Robin thing?  Teen Titans.  What's the difference?  Well...  It's a different show.  Yeah, it's a different show.  Yeah.  It's a different comic.  Is this a comfortable outfit to wear?  Yeah, it is actually, surprisingly.  All right, really shows off everything.  It's not as compressing on my junk as I thought. 
[01:39:30]  We're talking to this man, his genitals are very apparent.  Everybody at the Comic Con has been noticing it, the talk of the town.  Is that why you wore the pants?  That's probably why I'd wear them.  No, no, no.  No.  We don't say that to knock you, but my friend over there noticed, he goes, oh my god, look  at that guy's package.  I'm like, come on, man, I'm not going to interview him for his package.  I noticed.  Have people been interviewing you all day about this?  No, not really.  Were we the first ones?  Yes, actually.  We're not making you uncomfortable, we hope.  No, no.  All right, we just happened to notice something.  We thought, well, this is kind of an odd thing.  Look at him. 
[01:40:00]  Sam's even getting his flip cam out.  He really wants to take video of these two people.  All right, and what is your favorite thing to do here?  Um, people watching.  There's a lot of interesting people here.  A lot of freaks and geeks.  All right, so Sam is taking now a video of the genital-hugging trousers, and the guy's  very cool.  And might we say, congratulations.  Well, you're a lucky boy.  All right, take care, guys.  Did you get a video of his cock?  Oh, yeah.  Did that guy, was he kind of effeminate? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  I put it this way.  You had to ask that question?  If someone fired a cock out of a gun in the room, he would have jumped up and caught it  with his mouth.  I assume that.  Yeah, that voice was a dead giveaway of homosexuality.  He was a gay boy, right?  We're gay?  Is that why he asked for you two together?  And they just guffawed.  Oh, I was like, stop it. 
[01:41:00]  I love the cock.  Yeah.  Jesus, Sam.  Why would you do that to yourself?  I know.  A lot of these are...  Jesus.  Should we go right to Seven?  No, I want to hear from Morgan Fairchild.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Why are you trying to skip that?  No, because most of them are boring.  No, no, no.  No reason.  I just, like, I don't really do much.  Morgan Fairchild.  This isn't boring at all.  I like it.  It's Morgan, especially from...  Falcon Crest.  From...  Oh, right.  Yeah.  What about...  Old Navy.  When was the last season of that?  That came out, what, last year? 
[01:41:30]  Exactly.  They say how...  They say she's still hot.  She's good, yes.  In person, she's still hot.  For an older woman, yes.  We took pictures.  She's got to be pushing 60, right?  For an older woman.  Uh-oh.  She mushed her big tits on my arm.  I was very happy.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How did that feel?  Lovely.  Mushy?  The way big tits usually feel.  Fantastic.  How big tits can feel, man, unless there's only one of them.  Speaking of big tits, we got the clip of Jill Nicolini saying shit on the air this morning.  Oh, really?  Yeah, a little local news flub here.  Ah.  Arrow 11 live on the harbor. 
[01:42:00]  This is south of Governor's Island, the new Willis Avenue Bridge.  They're going to put it in place and hopefully get this replaced by the end of August.  Got to give a big shout-out and hello to Jim Smith and, of course, over to Ed in the helicopter.  A big shit-out.  A big shit-out.  What the fuck?  She sounds a bit slurry.  That's funny.  She sounds a bit slurry.  You notice that, Danny?  I'll say it.  Jill's an alcoholic.  She's drunk.  She sounds a bit slurry and tired this morning.  Listen again.  Arrow 11 live on the harbor. 
[01:42:30]  This is south of Governor's Island, the new Willis Avenue Bridge.  They're going to put it in place and hopefully get this replaced by the end of August.  Got to give a big shout-out and hello to Jim Smith and, of course, over to Ed in the helicopter.  Ha, ha, ha.  Big shit-out.  Oh, no.  Congratulations to Jill Nicolini.  Oh, nice.  Dropping a fucking curse on the air.  That'll be a big video for her.  That'll end up on the YouTube, as they call it, the YouTube. 
[01:43:00]  Hey, Florentine's outside the studio.  He is.  Why is he sitting in a big comfy chair talking to Kenny when he could be talking to us on the air today?  Yes.  Sam, you have to stay around because we're doing Comic-Con.  I will.  I didn't even know you.  There he is.  Hi, Jim Florentine.  How are you, Sam?  Come on.  Come on, buddy.  What's going on, man?  Oh, you guys are on the air.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what we do.  It's so fucked up.  People walk in and it's like, we're just texting or looking around and it's like, oh, you're on the air?  Yeah.  My favorite part of the show is when we have a 15-minute interview with somebody and then they go, is this on the air? 
[01:43:30]  It's like, gee, thanks.  Yeah.  I just didn't know.  Everyone was just looking at it.  Yeah.  But we've been in the middle of a long interview and they're like, when are we going to start?  Oh, we've been going.  Yeah, we've been on the air.  Where the fuck?  Hey, did you hear about Kings of Leon over the weekend?  Something that bird shit on them or something?  And they had to cancel the show after three songs because of a little bird poop?  Now, you're a rock guy, man.  Do you know of any bands that went through some crazy fucking incident but they continued the show? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, Ozfest in like 2002, something like that.  They put, Sharon had Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, Crazy Town and all that, you know, rap metal was in style.  And Papa Roach was on and people were just throwing mud at them.  This is a PNC in Jersey.  Right.  For 45 minutes and they just stood up there and kept playing.  They were troopers.  That's what we're getting at.  They were firing shit at them because they didn't know Papa Roach has had that one song, Last Resort, and they had to do like a 45, 50 minute set. 
[01:44:30]  So nobody knew the rest of their stuff.  Right.  And they just got pelted with mud.  I remember that show.  They were not happy.  Yeah, it was really good.  So they were pelting them because they were mad.  Yeah, they would just like get this rap rock off.  If you want to get to the, you know, I think Manson was on and Korn, that show too, whatever, but.  Whose idea was it to leave the stage after a little bird poo?  That doesn't make Kings of Leon look too cool.  So what happened?  A couple bird shits and that was it?  Supposedly went in with the bassist mouth.  Bass Clay's mouth.  Don't you spit that shit out, you know.  Jim Norton said way worse stuff than his mouth.  Warsh out your mouth and you get back on stage and continue the show. 
[01:45:00]  You wash.  Yeah, that's a washing, not a washing.  The fact that Jim said Jim Norton means that that's something he would have said anywhere.  Like, I'm the go-to shit-in-the-mouth reference guy.  I don't know why you would fucking walk off the stage.  That's very laughable, man.  Yeah, that's an awful band anyway.  You stepped into the middle of our Comic-Con audio.  Yeah, me and Sam went to Comic-Con to try to get some big celebrity interviews. 
[01:45:30]  So far, they have not disappointed.  They've talked to the Green Hornet girls.  Which aren't in the movie.  They were just the girls that walk around the convention.  And they talked to Robin with a big package guy.  Yeah, dressed in a Robin uniform.  Was it Natalie Portman there?  We wouldn't know.  How would we know?  Why would they get a celebrity like that?  Yeah, we had a couple of celebrity interviews.  But when they could talk to the likes of Gil Gerard.  Yeah.  I think I got to admit, finally, that we're never going to get any fucking respect in this business. 
[01:46:00]  At every turn, we hope for a little respect.  Well, because look.  It's unbelievable.  But every interview on TV is all fluff, extra.  Oh, these guys.  All that stuff.  So no one's going to come on a show like this because they know you're going to ask personal questions.  And they don't want to answer them.  They can go a million other places.  But I got a million examples of A-list celebrities that have been on the show that we treated with nothing but respect and did great radio with.  No, I mean, once they come on, then they'll realize, hey, it wasn't so bad.  Right.  It's just a reputation. 
[01:46:30]  But they also, it was like, we have to be pitched a certain way to their publicists.  Like, you know, hey, these guys are good.  They'll do a good five minutes.  Because you're only going to get five minutes in person with them.  And that's what's not being done.  We have those people in place, don't we?  You know you've got that publicist that's going, those are the guys that had, those people have sex in the church.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want to do that show.  That's all they say.  You know it.  Because they'll do a little Google search.  That's the first thing that pops up.  And they go, no, we'll pass.  Eight years later.  I know.  Meanwhile, they'll put you on some, like, corny show that nobody listens to. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  No, they've got a good audience.  Right, right.  I think it's your targets.  It's the moms in the minivans driving to work.  You want the soccer moms.  That's what they call it.  Really?  Just a soccer mom crowd.  Well, good news, though.  Jim Norton talked to Morgan Fairchild.  Nice.  I remember her nips in that fucking movie.  Oh, which one was that?  I don't know.  One of those 80s movies.  She had those big fucking nipples that were like an inch long.  Mr. Skin.  What are you doing, Sammy?  Just looking around.  Oh, yeah.  She was in a few of them.  In a second.  She had big nipples? 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  I wish I had known that she had big pussy lips, too.  I should have asked her.  Hey, MF.  You know what it is?  After that Travis the Chimp fucking attacked that woman,  they were showing pictures of Morgan Fairchild and a little chimp saying that she had done  a commercial with him.  Same chimp.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Alrighty.  What movie, Jim?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  That's great.  Thank you for bringing it up.  I really appreciate it.  After fucking you, Porn, Pornhub, SubmitYourExGirlfriend.com, that shit means nothing. 
[01:48:00]  That's the greatest site.  SubmitYourExGirlfriend.com.  It's all.  I think I got it from you guys.  Yeah, probably.  Someone was talking about it.  Somebody called up.  Yeah.  It's just the guys that are mad at their ex-girlfriends.  They send them cell phone pictures.  Yeah, yeah.  It's beautiful.  There's some nips.  God damn, you're right.  Morgan Fairchild nips right there, Jimmy.  Wow.  See, I don't know if they're, are those early implants?  What does bitty celebrity mean?  Oh, that's suckers.  Early implants.  You know what I mean?  It was like late 80s kind of.  I think that's straight out.  No, that's youth. 
[01:48:30]  I mean, she wasn't old, but she wasn't a kid right there.  She's got to be like 35, 37.  Yeah, yeah, right there.  Yeah, maybe because she put the arms up, the tits.  Yeah, they kind of lift it up.  Yeah.  Well, here's Jimmy.  That's a good stripper move.  Yeah, yeah.  When they put their hands up over their heads, it's like, okay.  Yeah, and then when you give them the 20, then they put them down and they fucking fall on the floor.  Jim paints the scene for his interview with Morgan Fairchild.  All right, we're in line. 
[01:49:00]  There's about five people in front of us waiting to talk to Morgan Fairchild.  And she was just talking to the worst black guy I've ever seen.  Fucking just a nerd.  But she kept talking to him.  And I realized we've had this at signings because there's nobody online.  She wants to keep people here.  So hopefully.  We've done this.  We have to talk to each person more because the line is short.  When you're doing something, it's like you don't want the line to die down.  So you give each person a couple of minutes.  A little extra time.  It's humiliating. 
[01:49:30]  They know.  Because you ask them what they do for a living.  So do you.  We turn, John, any question to hopefully the line will build.  Remember one thing we did in Boston years ago?  That's exactly what I remember.  And the same guy was coming around four times.  It was like a fucking merry-go-round.  He actually goes, I might as well get other things signed.  No one else is here.  I'm like, all right, thanks for pointing that out, asshole.  Yeah, it's humiliating.  So hopefully we'll get a chance to talk to this whore in just a second.  Jesus.  A bunch of kids. 
[01:50:00]  I don't know what they're waiting for.  And poor Gil Gerard is over there looking like he's a part of this.  No one is talking to Gil Gerard.  Fucking E-Rock would have more people lined up to see him.  I'll look at him.  He's looking around like he's not humiliated by this experience.  She has nice feet.  Jesus Christ.  Oof.  Excuse me, Morgan.  What's it like to walk over hot embers?  Oh, yeah.  Toes are all red.  Oh, God.  Toes are all red.  And her heels were cracked.  I don't know.  Nothing worse than a cracked heel.  No, it's horrendous. 
[01:50:30]  There's a man in front of us buying four autographed photos.  He's a potential rapist.  He has that fucking dry eczema face.  And a beard with dandruff in it.  And all he's thinking about as he talks to her is how he used to watch Falcon Crest and fuel rape fantasies.  She hates him and so do I.  All right.  Let's see if we can get in there in a second. 
[01:51:00]  And there's a big fat pig of a woman here waving off people who are trying to take photos of Morgan from a distance.  It's like, ma'am, do you understand?  And nobody has wanted a photo of her for 30 years.  Oh, she's shielding her face so they have to pay for them.  Oh, boy.  She's a cunt.  Seriously?  That's what was going on?  Yeah, she's signing.  Because the whole thing at these Comic Cons, these celebrities, quote celebrities, make a lot of money by having their picture taken, right? 
[01:51:30]  With fans.  So if you take a picture from afar, then you don't have to pay for it.  Right.  So then they're hiding their faces?  So you have to pay for it.  Wow.  How much did they charge for a picture?  I don't know.  Some of them are 10.  20.  20 for her.  I didn't mind.  I paid it.  Just to get a...  Wow.  And the whole time Norton's doing this, though, he's like 15 feet away from her whispering into a microphone.  So I was just...  It amazes me that you could blow through $100 for five pictures of...  Gil, Gerard, Morgan Fairchild. 
[01:52:00]  You could buy one and take the picture for nothing.  You could buy an autographed photo and take one for nothing.  But I didn't mind just...  I'm like, most of these guys are not working at all.  So I don't mind.  It's like, eh.  They make it more money.  As comics, we feel like we'll be there one day.  Yeah.  So be nice.  We definitely do.  Jim's right.  But for the grace of God, go I.  We're like 16.  We're signing pictures.  I remember you.  I saw you back in...  I saw you at the stress factory and like...  Didn't that burn down?  Don't go anywhere.  Don't go anywhere.  Let me tell you a story about the stress factory. 
[01:52:30]  There's one person behind him.  That's horrible.  Well, Jimmy, here's the big interview with Morgan Fairchild.  It's a dud.  We're taking a picture together now.  Morgan Fairchild and myself.  I'm squishing him.  She's squishing me in a lovely face.  Now I'm going to photograph young...  We're not sure what race he is, Sam.  There we go.  Now, can we interview you for a second?  Now, Morgan, we noticed...  Oh, my God.  Is she a vain fucking cunt? 
[01:53:00]  What happened?  I don't know.  She walked away?  No, because her poster, one of the corners of the big Morgan Fairchild picture...  Oh, no.  ...had come down.  And so she completely ignored Jim's interview request to re-tape the poster.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Oh.  These people suck.  Can we interview you for a second?  Now, Morgan, we noticed...  Oh, my God.  Is she a vain fucking cunt?  How does Jim Norton not get his own talk show from this? 
[01:53:30]  No, come on.  A late-night talk show?  The celebrity looks away.  You fucking vain cunt.  You vain cunt.  You know what I mean?  Tell it like it is, though.  You put this on FX after Louie's show?  It'll fucking be genius.  Fuck it.  Tell it like it is.  If they're walking out, who cares?  I don't want to fucking...  Look at her feet.  I love that.  Fuck.  Now, Morgan, we noticed...  Oh, my God.  Is she a vain fucking cunt?  She's looking at her own pictures and fixing them.  What is she doing? 
[01:54:00]  What?  Once they get the money, they won't really ignore you here.  All right.  We wanted to...  Do you have a website we'll plug?  We have a very, very large audience.  Sure.  MorganFairchild.com.  Really easy.  Okay.  Now, we noticed that you were putting your hands up while people were taking photos.  Is there some kind of a threat against you?  No.  Jesus.  It's some kind of a threat.  You're killing her.  You're killing her.  Just worst laugh ever, though, she has.  She's not like Uncle Paul laughing.  We noticed that you were putting your hands up while people were taking photos. 
[01:54:30]  Is there some kind of a threat against you?  No, it's just that people come by and just do grab shots, and you never know where they're  going to turn up these days, and it's...  That's not...  What?  Yeah, it's not like she's changing.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  She actually saw a picture of her from 50 feet away.  Where would that go?  Nowhere.  Right, but if you pay 20 bucks, you can get a picture with her, you could put that anywhere.  That's okay.  Exactly.  And you never know where they're going to turn up these days, and it's just a self-protective 
[01:55:00]  thing.  Oh, okay.  Now, obviously, the big story was when Travis the chimp, there was a photo of you with  the chimp when it was very young, and you worked to...  It was a different chimp.  Oh, it wasn't the same one?  My chimp was named Kirby.  So why did they link you with the murderous one?  I don't know, and I was not aware that it was a different one, and then the owner emailed  to morganfairchild.com to let me know, oh no, that was Kirby that did that, and then  I remembered, oh, you're right, that was the name of the chimp.  Okay, were you relieved to find that out? 
[01:55:30]  Did you feel lucky that you hadn't worked with the murderous animal?  Oh, what a question.  No, I mean, Kirby was lovely to work with, and I'm sure Travis was a wonderful animal.  Oh, Travis.  Perhaps those are not the...  It's not a great idea to keep primates as pets in homes, you know?  Probably because she was feeding it, Vicodin, and sleeping with it.  We all know what was happening.  It was really a creepy situation.  Well, I didn't say that.  You did, so...  All right, well, thank you very much.  I appreciate you talking about it.  I'm not on record as that.  Oh, no, no, I am.  It's okay.  Bestiality is not my long suit, so... 
[01:56:00]  No, no, no, no.  I mean, it's fun to think about, but yeah.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  That's fun to think about.  That is.  I don't like her, man.  Ugh.  Why?  I don't know, man.  She does seem like no sense of humor.  Whatsoever.  And I don't want to say that.  What, the chimp's going to sue you?  Stop it.  You've got to be respectful.  Yeah, that wasn't me. 
[01:56:30]  I think we could tell the difference in the voice.  She can't laugh.  Yeah, that wasn't me.  Obviously.  She sounds just like Jim Norton.  All that stuff is recorded, though.  All right, Kip talks to some people promoting No Ordinary Family.  Is there anything even with this audio?  Yeah, it's kind of funny.  It was where they could...  The fans could come and pretend like they were pushing a car over, like they were a superhero.  This one's kind of funny.  Oh, I remember this. 
[01:57:00]  I remember this.  All right, we're standing here outside of this thing for No Ordinary Family, which is a little sign.  It looks like Michael Chiklis.  Is that Michael Chiklis?  Is starring in this.  I don't know why they're not an ordinary family.  Maybe they're an alternative family where he's in a homosexual relationship with one of his male children.  That's what I hope it is, at least.  But there's a red car tilted over on its side, and I guess it looks like you can lift it.  So I want to interview one of the women about lifting the car.  Let me ask this bitch.  Clean it up. 
[01:57:30]  Where does this annoyance come from?  Oh, God, I love it.  I'm loving it, but where does the annoyance come from?  You just had it at this point, even though it was early on?  Dude, it was just one of those things where it's like, I know Stallone is on the premises.  Let me talk to the lady on the floor.  And you've got to make believe Morgan Fairchild is interesting enough to talk to.  And this was right after he had gotten past his bad set attendee at first, and we couldn't find parking. 
[01:58:00]  Can we bring Jim Florentine up to speed?  The company flies his two out for Comic-Con.  His company did?  Yeah.  I know.  That alone is pretty surprising.  Jimmy has a room where there's no shades, so the sun's just blaring.  We actually flew up.  We flew out on a fucking Canadian air show, Jet.  Assholes.  Have you seen that footage yet?  That was fantastic.  They're playing it all over CNN.  Holy shit, the guy fucking ejected.  Yeah, he jumped out right before.  Two seconds, not even two seconds.  Last split second. 
[01:58:30]  Unbelievable.  He was out of that thing.  So then they got that.  Then they had to drive themselves to the venue with no parking available anywhere.  Someone recognized Jimmy.  That's the only reason why we even have audio, because they would have been fucked.  Yeah.  And then they get there, and Sam is part of the press, and Jimmy was considered a attendee.  We just got, our bad just got messed up.  I was so, dude, I was this close to just getting on a plane and going home.  I'm like, fuck this.  I've been with him when I've had that rage.  Oh, yeah.  We all have.  That's why I'm laughing, because I wasn't part of it. 
[01:59:00]  So aggravated.  And then you just slowly egg it on, like, you know, it's not that bad.  Right.  Yeah.  You can still attend.  Congratulations to Sam.  You've been through the war with Jim Norton, finally.  Well, I mean, we had a lot of positivity, too.  You just heard the Morgan Fairchild.  Fuck having an interview with Sylvester Stallone.  This stuff is way fucking better in the end.  In the end, yeah.  But it would still be nice to get him on the show a little bit for a minute.  True, true.  All right, so we're talking about No Ordinary Family.  Car.  Let me ask this bitch. 
[01:59:30]  Can we, uh, we just wanted to ask you some questions, you bitch whore.  All right.  You bitch whore.  And I guess just because their backs are turned, they can't hear what you're saying.  That a fucking asshole.  But the beauty of that, there's always the risk that they have heard you.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I love about this type of stuff.  Well, Jim's been doing that for a long time.  Like, we'd be at the comic strip in New York, and some comedian would come in. 
[02:00:00]  And he'd be like, yeah, I just got on MTV's new half-hour comedy show.  And the guy's telling me, and Jim be under his breath, who cares?  Nobody gives a shit.  You stink.  Just so I can hear it, but the other guy can't.  And I'm just laughing.  And the guy's like, why are you laughing?  I'm like, no, no, I'm just happy for you.  And he's like, ugh.  Ugh, your act is horrible.  The whole thing.  I very rarely get caught.  Very rarely, yeah.  My girlfriend can't whisper for shit.  She has a loud dyke voice.  She's the fucking worst. 
[02:00:30]  We're driving, like, where I live, and there's, like, fucking ten black people.  Miss Elector.  Miss Elector.  Dude, there's, like, ten black people, like, four blocks from my apartment.  And there's a black cabbie.  When you're moving.  But there's a black cabbie.  And what you're supposed to do is just kind of, like, elbow the person you're with.  But fucking dyke voice goes, oh, you see how they come around at night?  And I'm like, shut the fuck up.  The cabbies are yum. 
[02:01:00]  Let's go back to the audio.  No ordinary family.  It's something about a car.  Let me ask this bitch.  Can we, uh, we just wanted to ask you some questions, you bitch whore.  Excuse me.  Hi, what exactly is this?  This is for ABC's new show.  It's called Not Your Ordinary Family.  No Ordinary Family.  ABC.  And it's premiering September 28th.  And it is a new show with, like, a superhero family, basically. 
[02:01:30]  Okay, this is not about an alternative lifestyle or something like that.  No.  Now, what is, how come this car is tilting over to one side?  Because these people have superpowers.  That's the thing.  You come in this booth and all of a sudden you're a superhero.  Oh, no.  But is it really the right message to send?  Because people are going to try this and hurt themselves with real cars.  Ugh.  Oh, no. 
[02:02:00]  She has no clue what to do.  But I'm annoyed at my awful question.  No, it's good.  Don't beat yourself up.  You're twisting and you're fucking with them good.  This shit's great.  By the way, I saw that Janine's here.  She's going to do the makeover with Sandy Cain.  Is Sandy Cain here?  Does she have her hammer and chisel?  I think Sandy Cain is here.  Have they started?  I don't know.  We need a before thing.  We need a before and after shit.  Quick, get a copy of Creepshow. 
[02:02:30]  All right, they haven't started.  Should we continue or should we tease Bob the Angry Flower for after the break, Jimmy?  Bob is a...  Well, Bob is a...  How long is that?  Bob is a quick one.  And yeah, I would think that we should do Bob the Angry Flower.  And if you want to tease something, it really picks up with the machete.  I would like to hear the machete because I know I was very annoyed when that was happening.  What's this about, Sam?  Well, the machete roundtable is the one where we showed up thinking that we were going to  get to talk to Robert Rodriguez, Michelle Rodriguez, and Danny Trejo. 
[02:03:00]  And we were informed once we got there that it was...  Not only was it in a parking lot, but the three of them were going to be sitting at a  long table, and Jim and I would be sitting amongst three rows of bloggers in lawn chairs.  How many feet away from the big stars?  A few feet, like five feet, but it was outdoors.  Dude, there was no way to get radio audio unless you sat as close as me and Florentino  were sitting.  It was impossible.  Yes.  And there was...  This is what a dumb cunt I am. 
[02:03:30]  There's a bunch of trailers, like where people...  I'm like, ah, that's probably where we'll do the interviews.  I'm such a faggot.  I'm thinking they're going to walk Michelle Rodriguez in there.  Hey, how's the field of be-off laws?  You know, we'd laugh.  And that's the one where...  You really thought that?  Yeah.  And he saw the trailer.  I'm embarrassed.  Yeah, yeah.  And he saw the one-on-ones going on, and he said, yeah, Sam, why don't you give the...  Give the publicist another call, because I said, Jim, I think this is the round table.  No, give the publicist a call.  Just double-check.  And they said, yeah, you see those white chairs in front of that table?  Just find a couple. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Just have a seat.  I was really annoyed.  He was aggravated.  Oh, yes.  Were you getting uncomfortable, or were you laughing?  No, I was laughing at it.  You can go either way with Jim.  I've been in both positions.  Yeah, sometimes you get to the point, like, maybe this isn't funny anymore.  I actually reminded him...  I reminded him that 24 hours before this had taken place, he was on The Tonight Show with 
[02:04:30]  his own segment.  Yeah.  And 24 hours later, he's trying to push through some bloggers to get a question out to Michelle  Rodriguez.  Yeah.  In a parking lot.  What a trans-sick position.  Yeah, but it's really weird.  It's like, you kind of, when you're at NBC, you kind of just interact with everybody who's  on the show, so you can walk up.  They don't separate you.  Right.  Because they don't look at you like a scummy second-rate radio show guy.  They actually look at you as one of the people who is a part of it. 
[02:05:00]  Right.  So they treat you as such.  You also missed Florentine, where Jimmy was getting recognized through this whole process.  Oh, really?  While we were standing in the parking lot, and he was sitting there, he ended up just  talking about what was going on instead of trying to get any questions across.  But while he's talking about how frustrated he is, a couple fans start coming up to him,  wanting to get a picture with him.  And the best was somebody who was sitting there setting up the thing recognized him and said,  Oh, cool.  Are you in the movie?  And Jim had to say, no. 
[02:05:30]  No.  No.  I'm here with the bloggers.  I'm just a blogger slash radio person.  I'm here trying to get a sound bite.  I'm here thinking I'm doing an interview, but like a faggot, I forgot.  Are you in the movie?  No.  I'm here just to be reminded of exactly who I really am.  I'm here as radio scum.  Some radio shows would not have to put up with that shit.  Well, Jim talks to Bob the Angry Flower, and then we get into that whole parking lot 
[02:06:00]  thing, which we're going to do after the break, because it's really good, you're saying?  Yeah.  I mean, that was the whole...  And that was the end of...  Because you really hear Jimmy annoyed?  Yeah.  All right, good.  And that was the end.  But this is all of day one.  That was how day one ended.  Everything setting up to no press pass, no parking, bad hotel.  And then finally, we're like, okay...  We've got to fly out really early just to save the company a few bucks.  Okay, well, we got...  The company threw him on a red eye in the middle of Comic-Con.  On Saturday.  We left that Saturday on the red eye. 
[02:06:30]  Because who wants to stay Saturday?  If you're flying all the way out there...  It's not on Saturday.  It makes sense to fly him back to New York at 5 o'clock on a Saturday when there's still  a shitload of stuff going on.  Dude, we're in the airport and there's no one there, and I'm like, I've never been in  the airport on a Saturday.  Yeah.  Never!  There's no one in the airport.  Yeah, it's way cheaper to fly on Saturday than Sunday.  I thought they were closed!  I had no idea the airport was open on fucking Saturday night.  Besides, I'm sure all the good parties...  I'm sure there were no parties on Saturday.  All the good parties were on Friday, like the Twitter party.  Yeah, why would they?  Yeah, that was a good one. 
[02:07:00]  We don't want to spend another day in San Diego.  Yeah, who wants to do that?  Yeah, relaxing.  Saturday night.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Who likes perfect weather?  Ugh.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  It was like 70 and sunny the whole time.  Awful.  Bob the Angry Flower.  We listened to this first.  We're going to do a segment now called Jerkoffs Desperately Looking for an Angle.  And I think we found one called Bob the Angry Flower.  Oh, look at this fucking awful attention whore.  Hi, Bob.  Can we interview you for the... 
[02:07:30]  Oh, you look angry.  What is Bob the Angry Flower?  What is the...  Is it a kid's book?  Bob the Angry Flower is a multivariant, multifaceted, multi-multi comic touching on pretty much everything.  So how come...  Why Bob the Angry Flower?  Is that just the character that's doing all these things?  That is correct, yes.  He's like a daisy, dandelion, sunflower crossbreed.  The kind that walks and talks.  Now, how did you come up with Bob the Angry Flower?  Like, what was the concept behind that? 
[02:08:00]  Go.  Well, pretty much just was going to do a 24-hour comic many, many years ago and did a little sketch of a flower with a mohawk.  And I thought, like, man, there aren't any other flower cartoons out there.  It's pretty easy to draw, circle, petals, make them angry.  That should be funny.  Okay.  Well, thank you, Bob, very much.  Good luck to you.  Take care.  That was Bob the Angry Flower.  Obviously, his name is not Bob the Flossing Flower.  There's a fucking four-inch layer of plaque in his teeth. 
[02:08:30]  It's really unpleasant.  Bob the Angry Flower stinks.  Oh, it's Camelto.  That's why the interviews are worth it.  That's Camelto.  Just somebody passing by.  That's why these interviews are worth it, just waiting for the ten seconds after the guy leaves.  Yeah, exactly.  I forgot about Bob's teeth.  Oh, they were awful.  They weren't good.  Remember the girl with the flu breath who was in front of one of the movies?  Wow!  When we went to interview Penn, by the way, it was fucking great. 
[02:09:00]  Penn rules.  Like, as far as recognizing the show and giving us complete, like, oh, yeah, let's sit out.  Fucking Penn was great, dude.  And you'll be able to hear that interview on the Opie and Anthony Geek End.  Ah, yes.  This Geek End.  Why can't we hear it now?  During our show.  You can if you want.  This is Penn talking about his Larry King interview and stuff with, about some, I forget what,  but anyway, we're talking to a girl, we're asking, where is this show?  We're running late for the, Penn switched the interview time.  So we had to ask this girl, and her fucking flu breath. 
[02:09:30]  Dude, it was pure flu.  It was moist, wet flu breath.  And then afterwards, dude, it was the worst breath I've ever smelled.  I was walking away, I go, dude, you gotta go ask her a question, because her fucking flu breath.  And you got a whiff of it, right?  Yeah.  Did it get on audio?  No, no, no.  We didn't think to do the audio.  We were just literally walking away, and he got her flu breath in his face.  But, like, we had to ask her, like, four questions, because the other lady started answering her questions for her.  So we had to think of other natural questions that we could just keep talking to her about. 
[02:10:00]  And on the way out, Jim said something like, hope the flu gets better, or something like that.  I shouldn't have taped that, but I just didn't think of it.  I hope your flu gets better.  I just didn't tape that.  All right, so right after the break, the machete thing.  The round table.  Where Jimmy finally had it.  The big round table.  Got great audio from the celebs.  Oh, and Jim was hungry, too.  He didn't even want to.  Because it was late, and Jim wanted to get dinner, so he was hungry.  And all this stuff had gone wrong.  Dude, I was going to leave.  I can't wait.  Sam, here's why we have this audio. 
[02:10:30]  Because Sam goes, eh, you know what, maybe we should stay.  Because I would have been, as they say, out of there.  Oh, yeah, he was out of there.  I was done.  The next three clips after the break, Jim sets the scene for the machete round table.  Jim dictates what's happening at the machete round table.  Jim's machete rant continues.  And that's cut up.  There's about 12 minutes of audio from the machete round table.  All right, listen, Florentine's in studio playing comics this weekend, Friday and Saturday.  Great comedy club here in New York City, downtown.  It's comics with an X, ny.com. 
[02:11:00]  For more from Jim and Sam's trip to Comic-Con 2010, plus geek-themed highlights from the O&A archives,  check out the worst of O&A, Geek End, premiering this Saturday at 9 a.m. Eastern, sponsored by FYE.com.  Everything for your entertainment.  O.P. and Anthony's show on the virus, Sirius XM.  Hey, this is Billy.  Hey, this is Frank Vincent.  Hey, this is Quentin Tarantino.  Hey, this is Richard Dreyfuss.  Hey, this is John C. Reilly.  Hey, this is Kevin Smith.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony, two dudes I could sit around and talk to for hours. 
[02:11:30]  And have sat around and talked to for hours.  We have returned.  Yes, we have.  Jim Florentine in studio.  Jim's going to be at the Comics and the Stretch Factory for his one-man show, Wednesday, August 4th, Wednesday, August 11th.  I'm dying to see it.  You're doing a one-man show.  Yes.  Yeah, I'm working on it, yeah. 
[02:12:00]  Well, Colin Quinn's doing a one-man show, which is unbelievable.  I saw it last week.  And I read a bunch of articles on Colin Quinn's one-man show, and people get confused.  What's the difference between a one-man show and regular stand-up?  What would you, how would you answer that question?  It's more stories, more personal.  It's not set-up, punch, set-up, punch.  Right.  You know, I've tried to do some of it in the comedy clubs, and it gets a little dark and weird when you do it,  when you're telling stories where you're almost molested and this and that.  And I'm like, whoa, you know, because you just come out of doing other stuff.  Right, and it's a little more long-form. 
[02:12:30]  Long-form, yeah, personal.  And, you know, peaks and val, a lot of emotions in it.  I've seen Colin stand-up, and now I've seen the one-man show, and I know it's different,  but I can't explain what makes it different.  One is a theme.  From what I understand, Colin's show is, what's it called?  75, well, yeah, the history of the world in 75 minutes or something.  So, Colin, the whole thing will be about, like, a progression.  Like, I saw one he did, which was, like, the history of industry or something like that.  I forget what it was really good, though, where he was going through how people were in the 1930s,  1940s, 1950s, 1960s. 
[02:13:00]  So, you know, each one, he was doing characters.  It's more character-driven.  It's a theme.  It's different than just an hour of, like, material.  I think it's called A Long Story Short, actually.  Yeah, it's called A Long Story Short.  It's a great show.  It really is.  I highly recommend people go see it.  It stops August 15th or something like that.  Yeah, I want to go this week, actually, Wednesday.  I think this thing could go bigger.  I think they're working on bigger and better things.  I think he's got fucking Jerry Seinfeld behind this.  Well, I think they want to move it up a little further uptown.  Go uptown with it?  That's what I'm thinking. 
[02:13:30]  Just give it the shakedown here.  They would love it.  Oh, yeah.  I would love to see him.  Talking about all the races.  Oh!  He gets some...  He goes after Islam.  He's not scared to go after Islam.  That's where I live.  Goes after the Catholics.  When you watch it, like, I watch it, I almost was depressed.  I'm like, the guy's so fucking smart and funny.  And, you know, I could just think of any dick joke that comes to me like that.  Yeah, I know that.  But to do that, I would maybe do maybe two minutes of that material in my act.  The rest, I don't even know what...  You know, I'm like, that's so fucking smart. 
[02:14:00]  And then feel all good about himself.  That guy paid attention in school.  Because he had two minutes in there.  I know, exactly.  He knows history.  He does.  I don't like that he takes a sip of his tea in between fucking segments, though.  A little tea.  Well, you know, he's a little...  A little tea.  Well, you know, I'm going to have tea.  Keep the throat going.  Lubricated.  I know the history of Black Sabbath.  I could do a one-man show on that.  Who cares besides Sabbath fans?  And Jim Norton would be a front row.  Yeah, exactly.  Yay! 
[02:14:30]  Jim Norton will produce it.  Something else going on.  Maybe E-Rock or somebody could run down the hall.  Fucking Santa Cain is in our office.  And she's getting a makeover.  We're trying to see how young we can make Santa Cain.  She is fucking miserable back there.  Why?  We yell in the screen at everybody.  I don't know why I have to do this.  I brought my blue wig in.  I just want you to play a few songs for my new CD.  I shouldn't have to do this to come on the show.  I'm like, we're trying to make it fucking fun.  Why don't you relax and do something a little different with you?  I was in there with her when she came in, and she was bragging about her outfit. 
[02:15:00]  She was telling Janine, who's doing the makeover, how expensive her outfit is, because she's  complaining that, you know, the naked cowboy, he just goes out there in underwear and a hat.  She's like, oh, I got these.  My pants are from Hollywood Boulevard.  My pasties are from Hollywood Boulevard.  And then probably about 45 seconds later, she starts a sentence with, so I'm at the dollar  store the other day.  But yeah, she's not happy at all.  She didn't understand why you didn't want to talk to her first.  She wanted to show you her blue hair and her new song.  We talked to her at Florentine.  We already know what she looks like. 
[02:15:30]  How is she not still mad at you?  Yeah, but now she has a different color wig, Jim.  How is she not still mad at you when you smashed her guitar that day?  That was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  But I gave her money for a new guitar, and then she comes in here.  I'm assuming we're going to see the new guitar.  She's playing that same guitar with a big hole in it.  And she took the money and flew to Nashville.  Because she broke the neck on that and everything.  Everything.  Do you think the crackhead really buys food with the dolly you give them to?  E-Rock, what's your observation down the hall there?  Well, it's rough because she came in fully done in Sandy Kane gear. 
[02:16:00]  But we told her we were going to make her over today.  She didn't care.  She wanted to show up presentable, as she said.  That would be in a coffin.  Janine is deconstructing her right now.  So when the wig came off, she has like double-sided tape on her head to hold that wig on.  Her original hair is kind of bunned up a little bit.  Did you get a picture of it?  I did a little video.  And down the middle, she has like double-sided tape just to hold the wig on.  Yeah.  That's how she keeps the wig on her head. 
[02:16:30]  And Janine, by the way, and I know they're listening down the hall, so I'm going to blow up her spot.  Yeah.  She whispered to me, help me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And they're hearing this right now.  I don't doubt it.  Sandy's appreciated that comment.  What?  She goes, help me.  Help me.  Yes, it looks like a harness, but she's wearing some kind of, I guess you could call it the man's ear or the bro, whatever you want.  The man's ear.  What's a man's ear?  It's something that a man puts his iPod buds in.  No. 
[02:17:00]  So she has this big, awful girdle-looking thing on, so that's where she's at right now.  But she's trying to wipe the original makeup off.  She's ripping off the fake eyelashes.  And Janine's going to make her look like Britney Spears when Britney Spears was really hot.  The Catholic schoolgirl skirt.  That's a long way to go.  We'll check in with that a little later.  Back to the audio.  Comic-Con.  Jim Norton and Sam went out to San Diego for Comic-Con.  We're up to the machete roundtable discussion. 
[02:17:30]  But it was very annoying.  Yeah.  And this was the end of the day, so Jimmy really finally had it.  I think I was just annoyed because I knew we should have been doing better.  Like, I knew we should have had more, you know, whatever.  Even though, how much are you really going to get out of a celebrity?  You're not going to get much.  And I understood we could make this funny, but it was just annoying to have to do that.  Right.  Because if we talked to the celebrities we were supposed to talk to, I still would have went out.  And fucked with those people. 
[02:18:00]  Of course, of course.  Sure, because that was fun.  But what being, what having such a bad schedule did was it just, it really removed motivation.  I was like, what am I doing?  Like, why am I, because I make money on the weekends.  Like, that's my fucking, my real money is Friday, Saturdays, shows.  And I'm like, I purposely didn't work that weekend.  That's what's infuriating.  I'm glad you brought it up.  The company's trying to save a, we found out on the hotel alone they saved, what, $400?  Not even.  You know how much money Jimmy makes on a fucking weekend and he said no to, he said no to so 
[02:18:30]  he could do this for the company and our radio show?  And I had enough already.  Do the right thing and do it properly.  That's what bothers me.  It's like, I had, me and Sam had suggested maybe we should go out there, but not, let's  go out there.  I don't want to hear like the slimmest budget possible.  It's like, I get, don't be extravagant.  They said that, right?  Kind of, yeah.  They asked what the minimum, the bare minimum to get enough for the show would be.  So we just shouldn't do anything.  We should just do our show every day from here. 
[02:19:00]  It sounds good from here.  We don't need to go out there and do this horse shit for people.  I mean, I kind of made the point that if we just wanted goofy interviews like, you  know, Bob the Angry Flower and stuff, we could just wait until the New York Comic Con.  The same people will be there, right?  I go to San Diego if you're not going to get celebrities.  Right.  But they did get us celebrities.  They got us in to the machete round table.  Machete round table.  Now this sounds exciting.  A lot of people psyched for this movie.  Sure.  Robert Rodriguez.  Yeah, this is a movie. 
[02:19:30]  Lindsay Lohan's in it.  Robert De Niro's in it.  I mean, those people weren't there.  Wait, what?  Fire Crotch is in this?  That's right.  Oh, wait.  Don't call her that.  She cries.  De Niro's in it too?  Yes.  De Niro's in it.  He plays the senator.  Wow.  Senator.  But those people weren't there.  But Robert Rodriguez, who we've had in before.  We have a little relationship with.  Danny Trejo, the star of the film.  Of course.  And Michelle Rodriguez from Lost and Avatar.  The biggest movie of all time.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  One of them.  Fast and the Furious. 
[02:20:00]  Well, let's not forget.  Yes.  Yeah.  All right.  And they were all doing one-on-ones, but not with us.  How that happens, beyond me.  Because nobody actually...  Is it really beyond you?  No.  Okay.  Right when I said it, I'm like, no.  It makes perfect sense.  This is why we don't listen to any ideas.  We just know how it ends and it ends up.  But here's the argument.  We made the most of it.  Thank you.  All right.  So Sam and I are in this parking lot, which Robert Rodriguez has turned into his, you know, 
[02:20:30]  I guess he's having a party here.  And we're supposed to have interviews with Robert Rodriguez, Robert Trio, whatever the  fuck his name is, and Michelle Rodriguez.  Whatever.  And that's where they're doing their TV interviews.  But our interviews, they want us to sit over there with the fucking bloggers.  They want us to sit at a table and just yell out questions, not happening.  And as Sam just said to me, it's embarrassing.  We've had Robert Rodriguez in studio. 
[02:21:00]  I don't know if we're going to be able to get an interview with him.  He seems like a nice guy.  He's over there taking pictures.  Yeah, we really are a complete scumbag.  The fact that they think that's acceptable for the audience that we have to just sit us  with bloggers, it really is fucking horrendous.  And we're not doing it.  We're not, I'm not asking one fucking question.  So tell us shit.  Again, I'm not saying that we should be able to fucking sit in this hotel room and get  an interview.  But do you have to completely humiliate us? 
[02:21:30]  Damn.  This is Jimmy's inner monologue.  We get to finally hear it.  And this is going, so you go ahead.  He was just, he was doing this out loud, like in the middle of the parking lot.  So any publicity person could have walked by and just heard the rantings of an angry,  angry man.  I was so irritated.  What a difference, though.  Like to tonight's show, if Jim does a bit, you know, he'll do it two weeks before.  They fly him out the night before to make sure he's in town, puts him up at a beautiful  hotel, and just has him walk out at the end and go, Jim, Jim, that was Jim Norton. 
[02:22:00]  Give him a hand.  Just fly all the way out there.  He flies to LA.  Take care of him.  So he gets a pat on the back from Leno.  That's it.  Because all the hard work was done already.  Right.  Which, by the way, was a great segment.  Which, Leno could just say that was Jim Norton, one of our correspondents.  Instead, they bring him out the night before, put him up, have him walk out.  He did the Leno thing two days before the parking lot shit you're hearing now.  No, no, no, no, no.  The night before.  The night before.  The night before.  So a lot of these people, as they're getting ready for Comic-Con, probably saw Jim Norton  on their TV in their hotel room. 
[02:22:30]  Now he's stuck in a parking lot with the bloggers, thinking he's probably doing another fucking  Leno bit.  Yeah, except there's no cameras, and I'm fucking, I'm standing behind lawn chairs like a cunt.  There's nothing better than the guy who said, he took a picture with Jim, and then excitedly  said, are you in this?  As in, are you in the movie?  Are you in the movie?  Right, right.  No.  No.  See, when people think you're in the movie, you can't then just turn around and go, no, 
[02:23:00]  I'm with the bloggers here, and I'm doing not even an interview.  No.  I'm going to try to shout a question and see if I can pick up the answer on my microphone.  Holy shit, is this great.  And again, I was being conscientious, because again, I'm not an extravagant asshole.  To fly down from LA to San Diego, they would have flown me down, but I was like, I didn't  want to be, whatever, let me just fucking get down.  I got my car rental sent to LA instead of getting it in San Diego, and I just drove down, I  think, two hours at night.  Good egg. 
[02:23:30]  But it's like, yeah, I'm not a spending asshole, but it's like, fuck, man.  Come on.  They really did just fucking, just send you guys.  But again, I did nothing.  Send for yourself.  Yeah.  All right, you guys are down there.  Yeah.  Thank God for Liam.  Make the magic happen.  Thank God for Liam.  I'll say that.  Liam really fucking is a trooper.  Yeah.  Liam.  All right.  The machete round table discussion continues here.  We are at the round table.  This is when it was actually going on. 
[02:24:00]  This is what the publicist for the film approved.  We need to list that up.  So the round table begins, and there's no, like, introduction.  It's basically all the bloggers are sitting around at the table and waiting, and once the  stars sit down, they just start firing out questions.  You guys got to deal with traffic and the wind, because there's no, yeah, it's in a parking  lot.  There's no speakers or anything?  No.  Oh, my God.  There's no microphone to, I mean, there could be speakers, but there'd be nothing plugged  into them.  Yeah.  No.  So they have to yell above everybody, right? 
[02:24:30]  They don't.  They just talk.  We didn't know what they were, we didn't hear what they said.  That's what, it probably is a good movie, but we don't know if what they talked about.  We got a picture with Danny Trejo, who was a nice dude before he went over there.  He's a fucking, he looks like a convict.  He was.  He looks like a pro.  I know.  He was an actual fucking prisoner.  Yeah, he's a rough dude, man, but he was very, he was very nice.  Like, people walking over, taking pictures, he just wanted to smoke a cigarette before  he talked, and very cool guy.  He was nice.  Very nice to the fans.  He wanted to smoke a cigarette?  Yeah.  Oh.  Looks like he smokes. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, does he?  He fucking eats cigarettes.  Wait, is that that Indian looking dude?  Yeah, yeah.  He's always a bad guy.  Oh, he was in Heat?  How great was he in Heat?  Yeah, yeah.  Was he in Heat?  He's fucking, he is a.  Dust of Dawn.  Yeah, Dust of Dawn.  Yeah, dude, he's just a savage.  Yeah, he's great.  Really nice guy, though.  All right, here we go.  We are at the round table.  This is what the publicist for the film approved us for.  So here we are.  This is really good.  We're standing here with a bunch of fucking bloggers, basically.  There's Michelle Rodriguez, and there's Danny Trudeau, who is, you can kind of see them 
[02:25:30]  over there, and you can't hear a word they're saying because there's no microphones hooked  up.  So I don't know how we're actually going to get fucking audio.  And Michelle and Danny are kind of just laughing and talking to each other, probably saying,  look at these nerdy fucks who don't realize we don't have microphones.  So basically, this has been just one long exercise in humiliation.  Here's Robert Rodriguez.  Cool.  Remember we had him in studio?  Yeah.  That was fun.  Oh, they're actually talking.  I didn't know they were talking because we're not actually sitting on the fucking tables. 
[02:26:00]  And since there's no microphones and no speakers, we can just kind of, lip readers.  This is great for radio.  We have no audio at the round.  Michelle Rodriguez is laughing.  Danny is smiling.  And Robert Rodriguez has on a hat.  Okay, so far.  Let me get over here.  The big exclusive interviews.  Okay, right now, Robert Rodriguez is talking to somebody who's with an earshot.  Now he's looking at Danny.  Now he's looking back at the crowd.  Now Danny is leaning back, smiling happily.  Michelle is smiling happily, laughing loudly.  Maybe I heard her. 
[02:26:30]  And Michelle is leaning in.  There's a fat man asking a question.  I don't know what he's saying.  He's probably saying, if I drop 400 pounds, would you consider fucking me if you weren't a lesbian?  Not that I know if she is or not, of course.  I'm just making a little joke.  And this is going on and on.  Oh, no.  He was sitting.  We were standing right behind where all the bloggers were sitting.  And the bloggers that were in the last row just kept turning around.  I didn't notice.  Giving Jim dirty looks. 
[02:27:00]  I didn't even notice.  Because he was ruining their experience.  Jesus.  Ruining their experience?  Yes.  Great.  And the rant continued.  Yes, it continued.  I guess the best way to do this is to get here at 3 o'clock and bring your own fucking microphone and PA system.  Because Sam and I so stupidly just showed up with our own microphone and a little recording thing thinking that a round table meant there'd be a few people at a round table.  They didn't tell us we were going to be in a parking lot competing with bagpipes with the rest of the bloggers. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, by the way, this bagpipe is playing in the fucking background.  Yeah, you're competing with fucking traffic.  It's embarrassing.  Birds and bagpipes.  Yeah.  With the rest of the bloggers scum.  Radio really is a shit fucking business.  I'm telling you.  It really is.  Fucking comic book artists get more respect than we do.  Now Robert's kind of leaning on his forearms looking out at the crowd.  He realized it's humiliating for all of us. 
[02:28:00]  This round table is just a way to tell these people here that they're going to get some kind of audio.  This is the press that they don't value.  These are the people who they don't really give a shit if we talk about it.  They're hoping to get one sound bite.  Maybe these people here will write about it.  I realize I'm being a negative Nancy right now, but I really want to firebond this fucking parking lot.  But I had such a good time on the Tonight Show last night.  It really is odd how fucking far you come right back to reality.  It was so much fun being on Leno.  Jay brings you out.  You know, they fly out first class, treat you good, five-star hotel, 24-hour room service. 
[02:28:30]  And here we are doing radio interviews.  Boy, things really do fucking bring you right back to where you belong.  You feel good about yourself for 20 fucking minutes.  Hey, we got you an interview.  No, you didn't.  You didn't get us an interview with Robert Rodriguez, Michelle Rodriguez, or Danny Trujillo.  You got us into a parking lot where we can watch other people not hear them either.  Nobody can hear them.  You know who's laughing?  The three of them because they're sitting next to each other.  They can hear each other.  We can't hear a fucking word they say. 
[02:29:00]  I just kind of wanted to get a little bit of a picture with Michelle Rodriguez because I like Lost.  But I don't really see that happening.  Oh, she said something and laughed again.  I don't know what it was because, again, I'm too far away to hear.  Oh, Danny's saying something too.  He looks like he's having a good time, but I can't hear what he's saying.  She's laughing again, so he must be saying something really funny.  But nobody in the front row is laughing because they can't hear either.  Robert is kind of looking pensively at Danny and Michelle.  She's laughing again.  Now Robert's laughing. 
[02:29:30]  Danny's laughing.  Apparently there's a big party going on at the table, and we can't hear a fucking word of it.  I should have known better.  I literally should have went out and just done a club for free.  And it would be less humiliating than this.  Do you understand?  Performing in a club for free would be less embarrassing than this.  Because people are very nice.  They're coming up.  They know me from Opie and Anthony or the Red Eye or the Tonight Show, and they're saying,  Hi, can we take a picture?  Sure.  I'm right here in the back with you.  Fantastic.  Whole thing.  How are you, sir?  All right.  You look like the guy who shot Robert Kennedy. 
[02:30:00]  All right.  All right.  I'm going to interview Sirhan Sirhan.  Can you hear a word they're saying, sir?  We can't.  I can't.  I can't.  This is humiliating.  Wow.  Fucking Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Bravo.  How did I not mic those guys?  That's a bad job by them.  That's unbelievable.  You can't throw a microphone.  What is it to get a small PA?  Because it's for bloggers, they don't need to.  Because what's going to happen is they all put their recording devices in front of the  people. 
[02:30:30]  Right next to them.  So basically the way those things work is you can go, hey, how was it working with so  and so or whatever?  Or you can just ask.  And they'll go, that was really good.  And all your little recorders right there, pick it up.  Yeah, but it would be nice for everyone in the parking lot to hear the answer.  I agree.  That's fucked.  And how many feet away were you?  Maybe 20?  Yeah.  20 feet away and you couldn't hear shit.  Not a word.  That's so stupid.  It's an outdoor parking lot in the middle of Comic Con.  We got a one on 40.  That's what we got.  So stupid.  You want to continue?  I want to continue.  Jim talks to Danny Trejo's son. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, the kid that he said looked like the guy who shot Bobby Kennedy.  Right.  As it turns out, he turned off the recorder and Jim, thank God, right before he said, you  know, it's not the actors because Danny Trejo's a real cool guy.  Robert Rodriguez is cool.  Michelle Rodriguez, she seems nice.  It's just the situation we're in.  And the guy goes, yeah, yeah, actually, Danny Trejo is my dad. 
[02:31:30]  Oh.  But no, I hadn't said anything bad.  Good thing.  I actually said I just met him and he seems like a really cool guy.  And then he goes, yeah, Danny's my dad.  Right.  And then we realized, like, there were some, like, Mexican guys with big, thick mustaches  and I noticed they were kind of looking at Jim and listening to what he was saying.  And I think we realized they're probably Danny Trejo's family making sure that...  Some of his family, yeah.  Yeah, but there was nothing, literally, because it wasn't the actors.  Right.  They all, again, Robert Rodriguez, you could see, was being really cordial to people.  Michelle was doing, like, TV interviews, so I didn't see her. 
[02:32:00]  But Danny, when people came up to him, was taking pictures.  He was very cool.  Nice guy.  So it was like, you can't fault those guys.  They're not the fucking publicists.  Right.  They're not the ones that fucking call and hook this shit up.  They just say, go ahead, sit there and talk to these people.  So they do.  Bravo.  So we went to the Machete Roundtable and got the exclusive interview with Danny Trejo's son.  Is he in the movie?  He is, actually.  And he's going to be a director.  But for the son of a celebrity, he was really a nice kid, man.  He was like, there was nothing shitty or spoiled about him. 
[02:32:30]  He really was a nice kid.  He was very humble and seemed excited to get a big tattoo on his chest.  Like his dad.  No, he's like a young gentleman.  Yeah.  He looks like a young, like 1920s actor.  Really?  He looked like a young gentleman.  Yeah.  Gilbert.  Gilbert, yes.  The guy we were actually talking to a minute ago was Danny's son, who turned out to be a very nice fella.  So we'll ask you, what is the film about?  Um, it's about a federally named Machete who goes rogue and, uh, he ends up getting double-crossed.  And, you know, it's not really about anything, per se. 
[02:33:00]  It's just like a, it's a badass action movie.  Now, who does your dad play in the film?  Machete.  Oh, he plays Machete.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Beautiful.  And then Robert just directs it, of course.  Now, what is, De Niro plays the senator in there.  Did you get to meet De Niro?  Yeah, yeah, a few times.  Yeah, he's, he's really cool.  He's really cool.  We went out to dinner with him and he's, he's really cool guy.  He seems very unpersonable.  I've met him a few times.  He always seems like kind of shy and quiet.  Maybe you throw a few drinks on him and he opens up.  No, yeah, he's really nice. 
[02:33:30]  We, um, sat for like an hour and talked about Godard and, uh, French New Wave and Italian,  um, Italian, uh, neorealism.  Oh, okay.  That's probably, you don't have that.  I've never heard of any of that.  That's why De Niro likes him and doesn't like me.  I don't know what any of those things are.  So, obviously, it's a good film.  When does it come out?  September 3rd.  All right, September 3rd.  So, you've, you've dealt with publicists your whole life then, if your dad's a, so you  know what they're like.  They're just, they're awful.  They're awful.  They're always running around and pretending that they're doing something and they're not.  All right, well, good luck to your father in the film. 
[02:34:00]  We've been there, right, Florentine?  Oh, yeah.  And the kid was actually, he was cool because Jim wanted a picture with, uh, Michelle Rodriguez.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, he goes, yeah, it was great talking to you.  Right after the thing ended, he was like, it was great talking to you.  I'm going to go try to get a picture with Michelle.  And she was surrounded by people.  Right.  So, Jim didn't think he was going to get it.  And the kid goes, okay.  And then the next thing we know, the kid goes behind the round table and grabs Michelle 
[02:34:30]  Rodriguez and says, hey, this guy, uh, he's a comedian.  He wants to take a picture.  Oh, wow.  And I shoot him right through.  Yeah, he knew my stuff, which helped, uh, Gilbert kind of was familiar with my stuff.  So that kind of helped him.  Yeah.  She was very pleasant and they were all nice.  Yeah.  And we get to talking too?  No.  There's rules when you're hanging out with Jimmy so you don't fuck up his picture take.  I mean, he...  What did he tell you?  Oh, yeah.  You guys do a dry run first?  No.  You didn't have to do a dry run?  He trusted me.  But I was right there with him.  You didn't have to hold the camera set and ready to go?  None of that stuff?  He had... 
[02:35:00]  He would...  What's great about Jim is, like, while he's waiting for pictures, he's just going over  the details out loud because he gets, like, nervous.  And he's like, okay, so...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's going to be on his way back here, so we'll grab him when he's on his way back.  He just left, so once he comes back, we'll just grab him there.  We've all been through this.  I know.  We've all done this.  He's insane.  And it was for, like, LeVar Burton.  I got yelled at once.  Really?  For LeVar?  Backstage at the Metallica show because I wasn't, like, standing properly against the  wall.  Silly of you.  Me and Jim saw Metallica last time. 
[02:35:30]  We did a dry run.  We were waiting for him to come out of the dressing room.  Oh, yeah.  We're taking pictures.  Jim's like, no, I don't like this light.  I go, let's even get it over here.  But we took, like, eight before they came out, and they came out great.  The best was we were at that...  I don't know.  That's some function where a bunch of celebrities were, and we told Jim that that black guy  was...  That's my favorite story ever.  Yeah.  I like telling it every time you're in.  That's my girlfriend's favorite story, too.  I love telling it every time.  Guy was talking to two hot chicks.  Jim went up and cock-blocked him.  They told Jimmy it was someone famous.  I didn't know.  From that show. 
[02:36:00]  It was all...  Yeah, he's an action star.  He's an action star.  He's an action star.  He looks at me.  You know what I'm saying, right?  I'm like, yeah, that show.  I forgot the name of it.  And Jimmy taps him.  He's tough to get, too.  You know, he won't go for it, but he did.  And then he looked over, and I was just fucking laughing like two little fucking faggots.  Hook, line, and collar dreams.  Well, I see the big interviews are starting to come in here as we continue with the Comic-Con  audio.  I see a Danny...  These ones are actually...  A Danny DeVito, a William Shatner, a Jill Gerard coming out. 
[02:36:30]  Wow.  Wait a minute.  I think they're kind of boring.  DeVito and Shatner are actually just straight interviews.  Yeah, nothing.  There's nothing to them.  They're not as silly.  You sure?  A positive.  I mean...  So should we go right to the...  Gil Gerard is funny.  Danny DeVito recognized the flag on the mic.  He's like, hey, I finally get to do the show.  Like, he was...  What is that?  We've been trying to get that fucking midget on here forever.  But he doesn't...  Again, we're talking...  What is he talking about?  It's all publicists.  What is going on?  Oh, wait.  You know what?  We're fans of Always Sunny, and we want him on the fucking show to talk about his vodka. 
[02:37:00]  Did you see him in Solitary Man with Michael Douglas?  It's a new movie out.  No.  Good?  Good?  Really?  Michael Douglas plays a woman artist.  Just destroys his life.  It's fucking phenomenal.  Really?  Yeah.  Why don't we know about this movie?  I've heard of it.  I don't know.  It came out about three weeks ago.  It's still playing.  It's still in the city.  Yeah.  Is it artsy shit?  Yeah.  You know, it's an independent film, but it's with Susan Sarandon.  It's in it.  Danny DeVito.  Michael Douglas.  Small film.  Check that out.  Jenna Fisher.  It's fucking great.  And it's called what?  Is that the one you're in?  Solitary Man.  No, I'm in the one A Little Help.  That's coming out soon.  With Jenna Fisher. 
[02:37:30]  Look at you.  Movies.  I just went to film festivals.  It's not out yet.  What are you playing?  It went to Long Island Film Festival.  Hey, right on.  Wow.  Nice.  What town?  Mystic?  I think it was Bohemian.  Mystic Film Festival.  No, Bohemia.  Bohemia.  Bohemia Film Festival.  That's something to put on the resume.  What do you play in the movie?  I play like her love interest in the film.  I got like three scenes with her.  That's fucking huge.  Do you get to, you know, kiss and stuff?  Well, we have a sex scene, but there's no kiss in it. 
[02:38:00]  Do you finger pop her?  Huh?  Do you finger pop her?  No, but we're like, you know, we're dry humping.  Did you have a rod?  Of course.  You did?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I'm on top of it for like an hour.  We're just going over and over to get in different cuts.  They just had me like a little bikini.  Did everyone else know you had a fucking heart on?  Well, yeah, when you get up, you do, because then they go cut and then you stand  and there's like 17 people around and I got to get up.  But I'm just like, I'm sorry.  I had to tell her, I go, I'm sorry.  She goes, look, don't worry about it.  Yeah. 
[02:38:30]  Did you make cumzies?  No, not even clear stuff.  Nothing, huh?  No, but, you know, when you first walk out there, I'm packing maybe a quarter of an  inch in a little pouch in a G-string so they know I got nothing.  And then when you get up after a half hour and you got a soggy six.  Did you finish yourself off in the bathroom knowing that you got hard because of her and  the scene?  Later that night, I did.  Nice.  You had to.  Come on.  That's why I'm saying nice. 
[02:39:00]  Of course you got to.  Don't skip straight to Gil Gerard.  Why?  Track 13.  13 why?  Before you get to 14.  Because we went to this party where William Shatner was at and it was just another, it  was the night after, so this is the next night.  This is how we spent our second night.  But it wasn't really a night because then you had to fly out?  No, no, no.  It was just Friday night.  It was just Friday night.  Are you guys getting to hang out Friday night?  A big Friday night?  I'm surprised they didn't put you on a train back to New York at this point. 
[02:39:30]  We were on a boat, like a, whatever, a carrier for this Twitter.  The Midway.  The USS Midway for a Tweet House party.  I guess it's like, it's not really Twitter affiliated, but it's sort of, I don't know what  the Twitter connection is.  But that's where the William Shatner interview was.  So we did that.  And there were supposed to be, like, 2,000 people showing up at this party and this whole  long list of celebrities that were coming.  So we figured we'd hang out, see what we could get, you know, maybe get some interviews,  get some pictures, whatever. 
[02:40:00]  And we realized, first of all, we got there about an hour early.  And so we were like, oh, we're the guys who show up too early.  But we were there for like two hours.  And by like eight o'clock, there was still nobody there.  It was maybe 300 people on two decks of a fucking destroyer.  It was bad, dude.  So when that's spread out, it doesn't look like a big party, huh?  But dude, this is the press area.  We got up where they were, like, we actually saw Hasselhoff came in.  We didn't talk to him.  We just got quick pictures because he was walking away. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  But that's where Shatner was doing his original TV interviews.  And we knew we had him, so we didn't pursue him up on top of the ship.  But like, that's the type of area they should have got us into for the Expendables, where  the TV cameras were, where we could have interacted, nobody would have given a shit.  And we could have just grabbed them for a minute and put the mic in their face and they  would have talked to us.  Yes.  That's what they should have tried to get us at these giant events.  All right.  Well, here's Jim talking about the William Shatner Twitter party.  Another inner dialogue happening.  Oh, is that?  Okay.  Jim Norton and Sam Roberts reporting here from the deck of the Midway, where we're attending 
[02:41:00]  the tweet party.  Really a jumping event.  You can see behind me, the VIP area is really, really bouncing.  We are actually here a couple of hours into the party.  You may think that we're early.  We actually did get here early.  And I love the fact there's two security guards in the red shirts over there guarding  the VIP area.  VIP.  Very invisible people.  Now, let's spin around here. 
[02:41:30]  And here's the rest of the party.  They were expecting 2,000 people.  They were sadly mistaken.  I think that they probably marketed it wrong.  They said, come to a party.  Have AIDS thrown on you.  This is the result.  This party stinks.  This is atrocious.  I asked a very, very old Negro male about the double helicopter blades.  And he had a hat on, which indicates that he worked here.  And he was like, oh, what's that thing they do?  And he couldn't think of the word rotate. 
[02:42:00]  So I asked arguably the stupidest human ever for fucking aeronautics advice.  Is that a word?  I don't even know.  There's a panel of, I think, comic book writers up there.  And there's 30 interested nerds who just are really waiting for things to start.  Oh, look at the band over there.  This is their big break.  They're going to be jamming tonight.  You know, they probably thought, hey, Shatner's going to be there.  Who knows?  Maybe Hassel put us in his new project.  Or the Hoff, whatever they call that fucking drunk.  I should have asked him about that. 
[02:42:30]  So how does it feel to sit on the floor picking up hamburgers, you fucking, you sot?  Yeah, I'm actually waiting for LeVar Burton.  And he's nowhere to be found.  Somebody's clapping.  I don't know.  Maybe there's a fire on the ship.  We don't want to be put out of our misery.  You described this awful party perfectly.  There's actually a video of it, too.  I was talking like two or two to a flip cam.  You're standing around fucking waiting for the big LeVar Burton interview.  There was literally the VIP area. 
[02:43:00]  We have to.  It was empty.  It was roped off.  There were two security guards in front of the area to make sure nobody wasn't supposed  to get in and a bartender inside.  And the two security guards and the bartender made up the three people that were in the  VIP area.  There was no one in there.  Not one person.  Just chairs.  And a couple tables.  And you guys weren't allowed in that section?  I don't know if we were on the list or not.  We didn't have wristbands.  They brought us up without wristbands.  So maybe not.  Probably not. 
[02:43:30]  LeVar Burton, I wanted to meet because I loved him in Roots.  And I know he was in Next Generation.  So I was sticking around.  After we interviewed Shatner, I was sticking around for LeVar Burton.  And so eventually...  Oh, geez.  I hit my...  Shatner was doing a live event there, a live webcast to a pretty big audience, 300 people,  which for that room was amazing.  And all of a sudden, LeVar Burton and Brent Spiner walk in together.  Oh, look at this. 
[02:44:00]  Whose reunion.  Whose data from Next Generation.  Except you didn't know his name at the time.  No idea what his name was.  He was a guy that could be gay, androgynous with white hair.  Yeah.  And him and LeVar Burton are standing in the Shatner area.  And Bill's doing a show on the stage.  Geek heaven right there.  Dude, I walk over to them.  And I go, hey.  I go, how are you guys doing?  Because we were about to leave the party.  Yeah.  And I guess the woman who was in charge of the publicity, she goes, hey, we just said 
[02:44:30]  hi to her.  And Jim said something like, yeah, I thought we were expecting like more people.  And she was like, there will be more people.  LeVar Burton and Brent Spiner are coming.  And Jim goes, oh, they are coming?  She said, yeah, they'll be here in like 20 minutes.  She was very nice, by the way.  They treated us very nicely.  Yes.  And Jim said, oh, okay.  So that's why we decided to stay and just kind of wait around.  And they did come.  And then this.  So I walk over to the two of them together.  And nobody knows they're there yet.  And I go, hey, I go, would you guys mind if I got a picture? 
[02:45:00]  And LeVar Burton, they were both hesitant.  LeVar was going to do it.  And then Brent Spiner goes, no, I got to do this thing.  And he just kind of walked away.  Oh, no.  But then LeVar Burton goes, LeVar Burton thought I was a Trekkie.  Because he goes, we have to do this thing.  Let us complete this mission first.  No, no, he didn't say.  He talked to me in Star Trek terms.  He absolutely said that.  You should have just called him like Geordi. 
[02:45:30]  No, what I wanted to say is I understand, Kunta.  But that's not the project I like you from.  Don't talk to me in Star Trek terms.  I told him, Toby.  That's what he should have said.  Wee's going to be over there, boss.  I didn't want to hear Star Trek terminology.  Let us complete this mission first.  Thinking you're going to run to your Trekkie friends and go, LeVar Burton told me he's completing a mission.  This motherfucker.  So I'm watching.  And that's where Jim got into this mood. 
[02:46:00]  Because he went, wait a minute.  Oh, yeah.  I think I just got blown off by LeVar Burton.  That'll happen.  And he started to trickle in.  He goes, I'm not going to get mad yet.  There's still time.  But I'm getting really pissed off because I think LeVar Burton just blew me off.  So Shatner's on stage interviewing all these nobodies from the sci-fi channel because he was launching this thing called MyOuterSpace.com.  And he's so unimpressed with other Star Trek people.  Oh, yeah.  He could kill us.  They came over to the side of the stage to let Bill know they were there. 
[02:46:30]  And he looked over.  Literally, he focused more on me and Sam when he saw us standing there.  Yeah.  And he just kept bringing on these nobodies.  So LeVar Burton went over to the side of the stage and waved at him.  And he goes, oh, I'll be getting to you guys soon.  And LeVar Burton's going up taking pictures of Shatner just to remind him, hey, we're waiting.  He fucking blew them off.  Bump after bump.  Wow.  Another person you've never heard of from sci-fi.  And here's somebody on sci-fi who once had a walk-on on Benson in 1980. 
[02:47:00]  He couldn't have brought on Bigger Fucker.  I was so happy to see that motherfucker getting blown off.  Wow.  Good for you.  Look at you.  You got to see a little fucking payback.  So on the other side of the room, LeVar Burton's waiting for his mission to be completed.  And a bunch of people were walking up taking pictures with him.  And I was like, fuck this.  So me and Sam walked over.  I stand behind him.  And he takes a picture with somebody.  He goes, all right, this is the last one, guys.  And then I just put my hand on his back.  And I go, can I get you now?  Because we're going to go. 
[02:47:30]  And he looks and he realizes it's me.  And he goes, where's your camera?  He was so fucking fine.  He really was.  Can I see the picture?  Yeah.  I got to see this picture.  LeVar looks okay.  But just look at what a fucking fat, trekkie lump I look like.  Hold on.  Where is he?  Get the camera.  Where's your camera?  Where's your camera?  Just, but look at.  Annoyed.  Look at me.  Look at what a fucking lump I look like.  LeVar actually smiles. 
[02:48:00]  He looks like an insect in it.  And this is after LeVar had been blown off by Shatner like three times.  He's not happy.  In front of the entire audience of people, like 300 people, everybody saw LeVar Burton  going up and getting Shatner's attention.  And everybody saw Shatner just brushing him off.  I was really, that was a, what a lump I looked like.  Who's the Negro?  And then, and then Jim, even though he didn't, he didn't care about Brent Spiner, because he  had gotten blown off.  He was like, I'm getting him.  I'm getting data. 
[02:48:30]  Because he blew me off.  He's a germ freak, I think, because he's on stage going, I'm here to not shake as many,  it's hands with people.  Oh, really?  I'm here to not shake as many hands as possible.  He said that on stage.  There probably are slimy people that shake his hand a lot.  But then, but then, so, so Jim got him after he was on stage and he goes, hey, you were  really funny up there.  That was his, he told me in advance.  He was like, I'm going to tell him he was funny and that way I can get.  I knew how to rope him in.  And so Jim goes, you're really funny up there.  What if he was up there trying to like get money for a horrid disease? 
[02:49:00]  I would have said great job, but you got to keep, like I wrote, I bonded us.  This is the way like fucking predators do it.  I was like, what do you mean?  Like, I was like, dude, you were, you were so funny up there.  He's like, thanks.  I'm like, hey, can we take a picture?  I won't shake your hand.  Like I made him a promise.  And he's like, yeah, sure.  But then I didn't think of it.  He saw the mic flag and he goes, hey, are you Opie or Anthony?  Oh, I'm Jim Norton.  And I put my hand out and he shook him.  And I was like, yes.  Oh, man. 
[02:49:30]  Do you have the audio of him ranting that he didn't get the picture?  No.  No, unfortunately not.  I did not have it.  Yeah, because it was, we were right in the middle of the William Shatner thing, so you  wouldn't have been able to hear it anyway.  We got the big interview with Gil Gerard, though.  Gil Gerard was our, uh.  The big get?  Buck Rogers.  Our last big, uh, no, this was before the round tables, but yes.  You remember Buck Rogers from 1970, what?  So you guys flew all the way out to San Diego to talk to Gil Gerard.  Gil Gerard!  Basically.  And Bob the Angry Flower, don't forget. 
[02:50:00]  And we heard him earlier.  Fairchild.  Yeah.  So.  We're here at Comic-Con with Gil Gerard, who's doing, we came back for you yesterday, but  you were gone.  How many days are you here?  Um, this is my last day.  So what do you do?  Are you working here?  Then I'm going to take my own life.  You just want to kind of go to Comic-Con?  Yeah.  Dude.  Just hear a fucking gun go off.  I think the point of this interview was like.  This is my last day on Earth.  Dude, he has nothing going on. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Pretty fucking sad.  Aww.  Nothing.  We came back for you yesterday, but you were gone.  How many days are you here?  Um, this is my last day.  So what do you do?  Are you, are you working?  Are you just going to kind of go on from con to con?  Like, do you ever get sick of these things?  That's the only one I do.  You do?  Yeah.  What, what are you, are you having any new gigs coming up?  Uh, yeah.  I've got some other, another, other conventions, but not Comic-Con.  Um, and I've got, um, I'm writing a book.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What's the book about?  Everyone's writing a book.  Buck Rogers.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Of course, it's about Buck Rogers.  Now, we have a guy named Eric Nagel, who's a big fan. 
[02:51:00]  Have you ever been annoyed by a guy named Eric Nagel?  Has he ever come, because he said he's met you many times.  I have no idea.  All right, so he's lying.  He said, he claims he's kind of a friend of yours.  Um, all right.  And when will your book be out?  What's it called?  Probably March.  It'll be called Buck something.  I just, I'm not there yet.  Buck something.  Okay.  Uh, and what do you have a website?  GilGerrard.com.  Thank you very much.  Dude, he was promoting other convention fucking appearances.  Buck something.  Dude, he was promoting a book that he's not even finished with the first draft. 
[02:51:30]  Buck something.  He's not finished with the first.  It's never going to happen.  And the only reason he said Buck something, he might not be able to use Rogers.  Yeah.  Buck.  They might not allow him to put Buck Rogers on the cover.  That was the answer to someone saying, how much is a fucking small coffee at Starbucks?  Buck something.  Boo.  Oh, God.  So that was on Big Comic Con.  That was terrible.  Wow.  So, uh, we...  So what was Stallone there for? 
[02:52:00]  You spend...  What you mean, Jim, is why was the entire cast there?  They wouldn't know.  Not sure.  I didn't know that.  We were actually going to get to talk to Randy Couture, who we had talked to three days earlier.  Yeah, true.  They were on the show.  I'm glad the booking department here helped you guys out.  So this is good.  Good stuff.  Yeah, Liam was very good.  Liam had to scramble.  We're going all the way out to San Diego to get has-beens.  If you play track 15, it does start with one last Jim humiliation rant. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, the round table.  Oh, Jeffrey Tambor.  Oh.  You sit next to me at the round table, yeah.  The round table for Paul.  Again, we, uh...  What's Paul?  Paul is a new movie.  It comes out, I think, in January.  Simon Pegg, Nick Frost movie.  Couldn't get one-on-ones with them either, even though they've both been on the show together.  Yeah.  Also stars Sigourney Weaver and Bill Hader.  Who, but Bill Hader, we've had in studio.  Couldn't get a one-on-one with him.  No.  Couldn't get a one-on-one with, uh, uh, Joel McHale, who we've had in studio. 
[02:53:00]  That's why I canceled the last one.  I was too humiliated.  I had to finally leave.  I had to score the, uh, Sigourney Weaver pick.  She was at the round table, so I asked her after.  It was unprofessional, but I asked her after.  She was very nice.  Was she?  You could hear her talking.  Is she tall?  Uh, yeah.  Yeah.  You got a pick with her?  Yeah.  She was nice.  She was very cordial.  Was she hot?  She looked good, dude, considering...  For her age?  Yeah.  Um...  To call her Ripley?  Yeah.  But she's, uh, you can see she's probably like 5'10".  Holy fuck!  She's towering over you. 
[02:53:30]  And she was, uh, as she was walking out, I just thanked her for talking to us.  And, uh, she was, like, very fine with it.  The round tables, I actually would do them again for casts, because it's cool if you  want to meet the celebrity and get a picture, but for, you should have a one-on-one afterwards.  There's no reason, audio-wise, to do that.  Yeah.  Um...  All right, we're here at a round table, waiting for some people from a movie,  with a bunch of print journalists, which is why everyone just kind of has their recorders  thrown on the table.  So, round three of Humiliation at Comic-Con. 
[02:54:00]  This is literally...  Jim was so upset after this round table.  I could...  He wanted to go home.  He was...  I'm ready to go home.  This is just...  It did...  It didn't get any better as time went on.  I'm like...  Who told you guys you're all set for Comic-Con?  Uh...  Satan.  Yeah.  Who would throw you out there and say, you're all set?  They just...  They got us the plane tickets.  They got us admission.  They got us a hotel. 
[02:54:30]  They said, knock yourselves out.  Yeah.  It begins today.  It's just astounding.  Nobody else has a handheld mic but me.  I'm sitting next to a woman and she goes, who do you write for?  They're assuming I'm writing because...  Or blogging.  Because I'm at a place where people who get audio don't come.  I'm at a place where people who write come.  Hi.  I don't know who this is. 
[02:55:00]  How are you, man?  See ya.  Hi, Jeffrey.  Jim, how you doing?  Did you say your name was Jim?  I am, yeah.  I thought you thought my name was Jim.  Oh, no, I know who you are.  I've loved you since the Ropers.  Oh, God damn.  Really?  Oh, of course.  Injustice for all.  It's tremendous.  Name them all.  Go.  Oh, God.  I saw you in Glengarry Glen Ross, too.  There you go.  Look at the play, by the way.  Yes, of course.  And that's it. 
[02:55:30]  Do you see how the audio...  That's how bad the audio is.  Like, I had to sit there because I was listening with headphones the whole time  and bring up the levels on the mic so he could...  And that's...  Jeffrey Hiss.  We need more Hiss, please.  Jeffrey Tambor was right next to him.  He left.  He was as close as Jim and I.  And Sigourney Weaver was two people over.  Jesus.  It's just...  I think that's the end of it.  Why?  Why?  Why'd you go?  Well, I mean, it was nice.  San Diego.  The con people were so nice. 
[02:56:00]  Honestly, dude, convention people can be real twats, but they were really nice.  They were great.  They treated us well.  They fixed problems that needed to be fixed.  The hotel people were nice.  Fucking San Diego has nice people.  Well, we need...  That gauntlet popping out was nice.  Nice parking lot attendants.  Really?  Yeah.  It's the same shit over and over again, but we need people that have our back here at  the company before we send you out like this.  Not in San Diego.  Into the wilderness.  They do have our back with a fucking boot. 
[02:56:30]  Here you go.  Take this in the spine, mediocre.  Here's second rate.  That's just lack of experience.  Someone has to say it.  Not on your part or Sam's part.  There's a lack of experience thing that is happening.  Oof.  Hey.  Hey.  We had a good time.  Well, I have an example of Jim attempting to participate in the roundtable.  Is this good?  Sure.  I mean, it's not...  You know, it's just to give you an example of the kind of...  There's two roundtables in this session, and they each lasted 20 to 25 minutes. 
[02:57:00]  If you'd like, I can give you the entire roundtable.  But this is a minute 70, and this is just to show that Jim did indeed...  Participate.  Participate.  He tried.  He tried to make the best of it.  Are you guys surprised with how kind of quote-unquote nerd culture is becoming more and more popular  to put in films?  Oh, because the movie's about these nerdy comic book geeks that encounter an alien or  something in Area 51, so it's kind of about that.  That's why I asked him that. 
[02:57:30]  To put in the movie?  Yeah, to kind of make them the stars of the films instead of the constant butt of the occasional  joke.  Oh, right.  Like, yeah, the nerds now aren't like they were, like, back in the...  Bill Hader.  They were like, they actually had, like...  They've really had their revenge.  Yeah.  Sigourney Weaver.  Well, it's nice to know that there seems to be a smarter audience that you're playing  to, which I guess you can call nerds that, but that's always nice to feel like there's  fans that really know the material and...  The audio is distracting. 
[02:58:00]  Like, would you guys...  I know.  Would you guys have to turn off your audio as...  The needles are being turned.  Yes!  It would have been easier with, like, an old-time tape recorder.  You would have got better audio.  Yeah.  I haven't heard hiss in years.  I know.  But, like, you heard the Morgan Fairchild and the Gil Gerard interviews, those sounded  great.  And, well, they should.  And that's one of the floor of Comic-Con.  This was in a quiet room where if I had just had one-on-ones, I would have been able to  talk to them legitimately. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  It wasn't an engineering problem.  It wasn't an equipment problem.  Those are air molecules hitting the microphone.  Yes!  It's up so loud that you're actually hearing air.  Yeah.  Who was supposed to set up the one-on-one interviews?  I honestly don't, because I think they made Liam...  Dude, I think they made Liam scramble at the end.  Yeah.  And I think...  We had...  Dude, we had nothing...  Here's what we had lined up beforehand.  A community roundtable.  That was at first what we had?  I think the first thing we got?  Sounds...  No, no, no.  It wasn't even community.  It was a show... 
[02:59:00]  It was a new show.  And I think Blair Underwood was the biggest star on the show.  Oh, wow.  That was what we had set up first?  And we were just like...  We didn't do it.  And I said, no, I said to Sam, I said, we're not doing that.  No.  That was...  That was...  We had nothing set up for us...  Just that.  ...but that.  And so I went to Gary, and I went to Bladder, and they both...  Look, they both did what they could, because they put Liam on it, and Liam did what he  could.  And so anything we salvaged, I think, was thanks to those guys and Liam scrambling at 
[02:59:30]  the end.  But there should have been something, I thought, booked for us a little bit earlier.  It sounds very last minute.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of last minute planning.  And we had that exact...  Which is no surprise.  ...situation planned with the community cast, which would have been Chevy Chase and Joel  McHale.  But number one, we would have had to leave early because of our flights.  Yeah.  And number two...  So we couldn't have talked to Chevy Chase anyway.  Right, right.  If he was running more than eight seconds late, we were going to miss our planes back  across the country.  How do they think this is acceptable?  And number two... 
[03:00:00]  For a top-rated show for the platform.  That's the audio you would have gotten back.  To leave early and fucking save a few hundred bucks on a red-eye.  How about a one-on-one with Chevy Chase?  How great...  That's worth staying in five minutes.  I would have had five hours.  Five minutes.  I would have loved to have had five minutes.  Why not?  He's a comic legend.  I mean...  Sure.  Next time you've got to tape Jim when he's in the rent-a-car, when you're leaving the  place, just that rant in the car.  Oh, yeah.  And just swallow the egg of on.  Say, it wasn't that bad.  I mean, I think we got some good stuff, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  And just throw those little comments out and just let the mic just run. 
[03:00:30]  That's just pure gold.  That's classic.  Oh, you should have seen...  When we...  When we...  First, when he was mad at the hotel because of the windows, and we had no parking, and  we looked around and realized that the comic convention...  The convention center is surrounded by hotels that are nice.  It is...  When you are near the convention, all you can see is nice hotels. 
[03:01:00]  Hard Rock Hotel.  Hyatt.  This.  That.  This.  How far was your hotel?  Ten minutes.  It was a ten-minute drive.  It was doable.  Could you have walked?  No.  No.  Oh, no.  We had a month.  Yeah, we would have had to walk down the highway.  Also, that's not doable.  Because you said the cab line alone was like a thousand people.  We would have had to...  How long was the line for the cabs?  It was endless.  You couldn't have gotten a cab.  So there's no way to get a cab.  So that's not doable.  Because the only way...  The only reason they even made it there, Florentine, was...  I think I told you, was someone recognized Jimmy and let him in a...  A parking place.  Yeah.  Otherwise, I was ready to leave. 
[03:01:30]  Or they would have been fucked.  We were in bumper-to-bumper traffic as Westboro Church was protesting.  And there was no parking.  And nobody would tell us for...  And the other parking we didn't have permits for.  And I was like, this fucking blows.  Well, you know what happened.  You know whoever went on Orbitz.com, you know, a week before.  And saw a hotel, you know, 8.7 miles from Comic-Con.  Sounded good.  $119.  Perfect.  Can't beat the price.  Perfect.  That's it.  We'll shove these idiots in here.  $360 right next to Comic-Con? 
[03:02:00]  No.  $119.  Super 8.  Mike and Indiana.  Perfect.  This is a prime example why you need rolling back.  They don't see it our way.  Well...  Over and over again, things get fucked up.  And we have a solution.  But they don't want to listen to our solution.  I am happy we got to go.  And none of this would have been possible without FYE.com.  So let's be honest about that.  Yeah, I was happy.  Look, wait, I want to hear the rest of the roundtable discussion here.  I know a lot about movies.  It's always fun to be involved in a project like that.  Yeah, especially now when people are a lot more savvy and stuff and kind of get, you know, 
[03:02:30]  things.  The audio.  The sci-fi nerds and fantasy nerds were always like that, I think.  I think they were always really smart people who didn't feel comfortable with mainstream  society.  And now mainstream society doesn't feel comfortable with anything.  And this society, I think, is, as you said...  Sounds like when she blew the airlock to let the alien out of the fucking ship.  Because, like, all this stuff is invented by nerds, you know?  I mean, it's the century of the nerd.  It's boring.  Hallelujah. 
[03:03:00]  This is all nerd.  I laughed to make it more interesting.  It really was very dull.  Like, that audio would be fine to listen to and write down a quote.  Yeah, yeah.  But it's a bit far from broadcast quality.  Broadcast quality.  Exactly.  Yeah.  That's just...  You should have a tape recorder up there.  You listen back.  You're in front of your computer.  Oh, yeah.  They did say that.  Typing it on your little blog.  Yeah.  John in Philly. 
[03:03:30]  John.  Hey, boy.  Hello, John.  Hey, sorry to hear your Comic-Con experience wasn't what you wanted it to be.  As somebody who's had to...  What do you mean what I wanted it to be?  Not humiliating?  Naturally.  Actually, for as much as it sounds like a lot of it was a clusterfuck, the hotel situation  is actually kind of like a bad Comic-Con thing because you have to register like six  months in advance for the hotels.  You need to give them a list of like your top ten hotels in the area.  Right.  Even if you do that like months beforehand, I did that, and they still gave me a hotel 
[03:04:00]  like 20 minutes away.  That's why I don't kill the...  Bullshit.  I'm not killing anybody for the hotel because you really do...  We talked to one guy who said in February you can't book a year in advance, and he said  in February he tried to book, and he only got two nights at the Hilton that was right  there and two nights somewhere else.  So I think that they actually did a good job of getting us a hotel that was...  Once we got the route down, we were fine.  I'm not bitching about the hotel.  I think the hands were a little bit tied on that.  The fact that we had to check out on 5 o'clock on a Saturday is incomprehensible to me as 
[03:04:30]  a guy who's in show business, or apparently on the fringes of it, looking through the  window like Dwight.  Wait, you had to check out Saturday at like 1 o'clock or noon?  No, no, no.  We actually got the half day rate.  But if I had gone for that, we would have.  But there's no human way I was ever going to take my bags to Comic-Con.  How annoyed was he in the lobby of the hotel when you guys were leaving the hotel, Sam?  So once we were leaving, he wasn't really annoyed anymore.  It was more like, I'm glad we're just, we got stuff that we're going to be able to put 
[03:05:00]  on the air, and we fulfilled our commitment, and I get to leave and not deal with any more  humiliation.  I'm happy about it.  It's little things, really, it's like, you know how things are supposed to be done, that's  all.  And it was, you know, little shit would have made it...  Not done that way.  Yeah.  But it was like every single time we turned a corner and did something else, it was just  another thing.  It was like, it got to the point where it was whimsical almost. 
[03:05:30]  And there was, I mean, there was just, literally, it was just, well, Sam, Jim, you're off.  And just us in the wild.  You know who was nice?  We talked to Shatner for a few minutes sitting down.  He was very nice, and his people were very nice.  His assistant was a nice guy, and exactly as the way it was supposed to go off, it went  off.  Maybe five minutes late, Bill came over, sat down.  Me and him, he was going to stand, I'm like, do you want to sit?  He goes, yeah, we just sat on two chairs, talked for a few minutes.  Got the ten minutes, yeah.  You got, we got William Shatner, which was cool. 
[03:06:00]  Danny DeVito, which was cool.  Yeah, DeVito was, again, it was standing up.  They might be able to cut something out of that for audio, because he was just describing  the project he's working on.  And we had very limited time, but he's a fucking A-list star, so we got anything with Danny  DeVito was cool.  And we'll play it on the Geek End coming up.  Oh.  When's that, Sam?  That's this Geek End.  Saturday and Sunday.  I actually say, I love geek shit like that.  I love these conventions.  The fun part for me, celebrities are great, but I actually love seeing the fucking, like 
[03:06:30]  the lower level, like Janet from Three's Company.  I love that.  Freak shows.  Yeah.  It's like a freak show.  FYE.com, everything for your entertainment, right?  Sponsoring Geek End?  Yes.  FYE.com, they sponsor our whole trip down there.  Without them, there's no way.  Yeah, so I appreciate, they actually, without them, we wouldn't have gotten anything.  Yeah, it's not about them.  They did their job.  They absolutely did their job.  Uncle Paul pipes up at the round table, is this where he's called Paul?  Yeah, so he just kept, I mean, Jim, first of all, this was the second round table of 
[03:07:00]  people, with people much less interesting, so...  Oh, the big stars leave, and then they do the second tier.  Well, we had Nick and Simon.  Yeah, Simon.  I'm the director.  Simon Pegg was there, but Simon Pegg, he'd gone on three hours of sleep, he was tired,  the director was boring, so Jim kind of stopped asking questions, and Uncle Paul just started  going, eh?  It was just noises.  With all the CGI and everything that went into making Paul, would you consider this 
[03:07:30]  to be your most ambitious directing gig?  Okay.  It's the most challenging, it's the most, I'm the most in over my head, I'd say.  It's close, but it's also for you, if you're going back to your run, you're going to...  In New York, I live in New York, and yeah, mostly because my wife and I just have twin babies  this year, and so I just, they're a little too young to fly.  Oh, you had enough of a plate with it.  There's a lot of child bearing in this movie, it's strange. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, it was like the most fertile Paul.  Fertile.  I mean, I have runny.  Every time there's mentioned children of the name Paul.  That's the audio quality we got.  I was thinking about just giving you the full round table, and just waiting and seeing how  long you could survive.  How long you played it?  This is really good.  Just wait for it.  We thought of doing that, like, just give him everything.  Tell him it's all great.  The whole 25 minutes, and just the whole time, just going like, no, no, no, no, just a sec, 
[03:08:30]  just a sec.  Because you'd go 25 minutes.  How much of this would be played?  Dude, trust us.  That would have been great.  Just let it go.  And Comic-Con has become the place to be for all A-listers and stuff, right?  Angelina Jolie.  Apparently, Angelina Jolie was there.  Yeah.  Will Ferrell.  Mark Wahlberg.  Tina Fey.  Seth Rogen.  Jonah Hill.  We didn't see him.  J.J. Abrams.  We didn't see him.  Sylvester Stallone.  We didn't see him.  Bruce Willis.  Heard he was there.  Who else? 
[03:09:00]  Harrison Ford.  We didn't see him.  Was he there?  All those people were there.  I think Harrison Ford wasn't there.  Yeah.  Samuel L. Jackson.  Well, he was there.  We didn't see him.  Wasn't Harrison Ford doing something when that guy got stabbed in the head?  Yeah, the guy in Hall H.  Yeah, people line up for these giant panel discussions.  Yeah.  And they line up overnight and wait to fill into this room so they could just watch celebrities  talk about the movie they're in.  Sounds great.  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  I don't know if we missed out on things, but Jim and I did not go to any panel discussions.  We could have, because security would have let us cut the line and go in there.  That's pretty funny.  Now, guys, let's bring this back to the point.  I mean, you might not have talked to the A-listers, but you did talk to the Green Hornet girls.  Wait, where's Superman guy?  Oh, I had him.  I just thought it was visual because he kept punching you.  Oh, yeah, there's a very, very old man dressed like Superman.  With boxing gloves on.  And he was just punching you?  He just kept punching Jim.  Why did you punch him in the face? 
[03:10:00]  Because he was so old you couldn't.  That's wild.  But he's allowed to punch you?  Fuck that shit.  He was jabbing me lightly.  Fuck that shit.  He's crazy.  Okay, yeah, you're right.  But we videoed it, though.  You guys had some terrific interviews.  The Green Hornet girls that aren't in the movie.  Robin with the big package.  Morgan Fairchild was a big one.  Bob the Angry Flower Guy.  Let's not forget about that.  That was a good one.  Classic.  Danny DeVito.  William Shatner.  Danny Trejo.  Gilbert Trejo.  Yes.  That's right.  A very nice boy.  Gil Gerard. 
[03:10:30]  And sort of Jeffrey Tambor.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jim talking to him about the Ropers.  A little bit.  Final thoughts, gentlemen.  To summarize.  To summarize.  About your Comic-Con experience.  All right.  Wait, wait.  Let Sam go first.  I think Sam should go first.  I think we had a great time out there.  We made the most of what was going on.  We came back with some fun stuff.  Stories, experiences, and even some clips that we could share with the fans.  But how about a few?  What did we learn? 
[03:11:00]  Well.  Learns.  It's like, what can we do to make this experience better for you guys next year?  Well, if you're going to fly somebody the caliber of a James Norton down to Comic-Con,  especially the night after he was on The Tonight Show, maybe some sort of, not so much.  He basically, they gave him a stick with a handkerchief and a banana tied into it and  said, go find your way down there, little Jim.  Like a little hobo.  Right.  Like maybe, maybe we could go back on Sunday morning next time. 
[03:11:30]  Maybe.  That would be nice.  Book in advance.  Spend the night.  Enjoy yourself in San Diego.  Parking permit.  Maybe get a parking permit.  Something as silly as that.  Yeah.  Or somebody call a publicist for us and go, hey, these guys are good.  You should get them on instead of the email, which I wasn't supposed to see that I saw  that I won't talk about.  Oh.  Jim, how different would have been if The Tonight Show sent you there?  Oh, my God.  Like what celebrities you think you would have got if The Tonight Show sent you for a 
[03:12:00]  segment?  That, why don't you just say, hey, Rock Hudson, how different would things have been if you  didn't get fucked in the ass?  A lot.  Jim, you want to summarize your experience at Comic-Con?  And maybe.  Boo!  Not even the Twitter party?  The fucking Twitter party.  Jimmy gave up a paying gig to do the right, to do right by the company in the show.  I didn't take a paying gig. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah, I kind of kept the weekend open.  And in turn, they made sure you flew really fucking cheap.  The issue I have is the effort that was put in by certain people like, there are certain  people that are going to say no to radio.  There are certain people that will not let you in the press room.  There are things beyond the control of the company.  And I get that.  I'm not unreasonable at all.  But when I know that I got a round table with a fucking guy who sits down and goes,  hey, man, you're funny.  It's good seeing you again.  Who was on the radio show.  I could have had a one-on-one with that guy. 
[03:13:00]  When people aren't telling these publicists, hey, this is a good show, these guys will  do a good job for you, you should really do it, then what's the use of, I'll never  do it again.  There are rooms where before a big panel, like we talked about, all the celebrities do panels.  Before the panels, there are rooms that most of the celebrities are in that press gets  to go in, certain press gets to go in, and they can talk to these people for a couple  minutes before they go on, just to, real quick, one-on-one, whatever. 
[03:13:30]  If I didn't know about these rooms before we went, I still wouldn't know that they exist,  because we didn't see the inside of one of them.  Did you ever see the inside of them, though?  Oh, yes, in 2007.  What happened?  Before the big panels, there were press rooms.  Yes, and I went in and interviewed people one-on-one for five to ten minutes.  Well, there were some TV cameras, right?  First, here's what happened.  There was a Comic-Con backdrop, there were TV cameras, they did TV interviews, and then 
[03:14:00]  they walked around the room, and you could just go up and talk to whoever you wanted to  for five minutes, tell them who you are.  Sounds nice.  There was a list before you got in the room, so nobody who isn't supposed to be in the  room would be in the room.  We were in the list of the people who wouldn't supposed to be in the room.  So if we were in one of those rooms this year, somebody would have said,  you're not supposed to be here.  But in 2007, you were supposed to be there.  Yes, and I was.  So you were allowed in.  I was.  Okay.  Good job. 
[03:14:30]  You should have just had your Tonight Show appearance on your iPhone, and then anybody  that said anything where you weren't supposed to be, just go, look, and show it and go,  this was last night.  Yeah.  They probably would have said, we didn't see it.  We were doing interviews with radio shows.  And it's not an ego thing.  It's like, literally, you just kind of know how things should be done after you've done  a few different vehicles.  You know how things should be done.  Of course.  And it's like, that was very frustrating.  You have every right to bitch, Jimmy. 
[03:15:00]  You don't have to preface it by saying that.  But I mean, the fact that those, that I, it's an impossibility that effort was put  out to get us those people, because after we bitched and they put Liam on the case,  he did whatever he could and got us some stuff.  Last minute, he did.  Liam did fucking his job.  I'm not bitching out Liam either.  Were you left to your own devices at the Inventors Conference?  After we got back to the hotel?  Yeah.  Before that.  Oh, it was really, I mean, again, they have a camera.  So it was myself, Jim Wise, who's one of Jay's writers, and a very funny guy, and fucking 
[03:15:30]  the cameraman, who was a segment producer as well, and this guy, Izzy, who kind of ran  everything, and this Hawaiian guy, who kind of was an assistant, and then a makeup person.  Tony Rakihara?  Oh, wait a minute.  No, he was Samoan.  There was like six of us, and we had the head of the convention walking us around and showing  us things and making sure our badges were correct and everything was correct.  All right.  See?  That's the way shit works.  You had, almost had an attendee badge.  There you go. 
[03:16:00]  Here's a Mythbusters bag, faggot.  Wear this over your head.  But, in the end, you guys brought back great audio.  Unbelievable.  Great stuff.  Hey, Florentine's going to be at Comics Friday and Saturday.  He's on the show here today.  Comics with an X, ny.com for tickets.  And then the one-man show, Wednesday, August 4th, and Wednesday, August 11th at the Stress  Factory, Phinney's Fine Club in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  After the break.  Yes.  Sandy Kane's makeover.  Absolutely.  The O.B. and Anthony Show on the virus. 
[03:16:30]  Virus.  Sirius XM.  Busy show hanging with Jim Florentine today.  Jim Norton back from Comic-Con.  Heading to Atlanta.  Oh, Atlanta this weekend, right?  Yes, I'll be there Thursday, Friday, Saturday at the punchline.  Ooh.  You know what?  I want to go.  I want to jump on a plane.  I got a nephew down there.  Atlanta's a cool city, man.  I really like it a lot there.  Yeah, me and I loved it so much that we decided not to work there. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  And never been back.  Yeah, I don't think...  Oh, no.  I've been back for a wedding.  Really?  Back for a couple things over the years.  You guys were never on down there?  Atlanta, like when you're on regular radio?  Not...  I don't think so.  They wanted us down there.  I've lost track of the markets over the years.  I don't think we have.  A better offer came through.  Yeah.  New York City.  Our stupid agent goes, I don't know, man.  I think you should go to Atlanta.  Like, we're from New York and we got two radio stations fighting for us in New York.  Really?  You think we should go to Atlanta? 
[03:17:30]  Yeah, I think I'll take...  I think at this point in my career, I would like to fucking live home.  Kind of be home for, yeah.  Yeah, in my hometown.  A few years.  Christ.  That worked out.  Danny, what do you got?  We have a makeover going on.  Yeah, there's the big Sandy Kane makeover going on.  It's taking place in the office.  And I was back there just kind of listening in on Sandy's little anecdotes and such. 
[03:18:00]  Right.  And boy, oh boy, does she have a big mouth and does she talk shit?  About everyone?  Of course she does.  Just about everything.  I mean, I don't even know where to begin.  You've written down some of the shit talking.  Well, yeah, because you know what?  Like, it was going on and at first I just was kind of giggling and, you know, going, ugh.  Fucking insane.  But then it got to the point where I just started to...  I just had to start writing stuff down because I knew it was going to be too much for me  to remember.  So I just wrote down, like, pages upon pages of stuff.  That's what I meant. 
[03:18:30]  Florida team farted.  And he's just slowly waving a paper into Jimmy's face.  It's awful.  And Jimmy just went, ugh.  What did you have last night?  I don't even know.  It's just...  I like the combo.  They're not that bad anymore, though.  No?  Smells like you got fucked in the ass with a shit hoagie.  It's terrible.  I was down by near Philly, so maybe there was a leftover hoagie in there.  Hoagie or cheese steak or something?  One of those Philly pretzels.  Pork roll?  I just learned about pork roll.  Pork roll?  Yeah, that's like a Philly...  Pork roll rolls.  That's a Jersey thing, too. 
[03:19:00]  What is it called up here, though?  I can't figure it out.  Canadian bacon?  What is it?  Tail of ham, maybe, or something?  I don't know what it is, but it's delicious.  I almost said delicious.  Somebody got killed for that one.  I was able to get the ish in there.  What are you doing, Jimmy?  I'm looking for a plug that this fucking magazine was paying.  Why?  That won't...  What about that wall?  What?  Over there.  Where?  Huh?  Right over there.  Huh?  No.  Can't see it!  No.  No.  No.  Jimmy, if you want, I got one on the floor over here. 
[03:19:30]  The other side.  Jimmy, right down there.  All right, forget to eat the TV.  Follow the TV.  Don't use my plug.  No, over...  All right, what am I doing?  You asshole.  I don't know where our fucking plug is.  So, Sandy Cain...  I'm just pointing right over there, and he's bent over, looking to plug it.  Why would I...  Oh, Jimmy.  Sandy Cain is shit-talking.  What do you got?  Yeah, I mean, I don't know where you want to begin.  You know, she would just start bringing up celebrities and how she knows them, and she meets a lot of celebrities.  She was in this movie.  She was in that movie. 
[03:20:00]  So, unsolicited, she just kind of babbles?  Yeah, she would just...  Yeah, kind of like, you know, she's going, oh, you know, I live in, you know, this building, and there's a lot of celebrities around there.  Oh, this one I was in.  She goes, oh, I was in...  You ever see One Fine Day with George Clooney?  I was in that.  Oh, Michelle Pfeiffer.  I was in Kings of New York.  She's friends with Peaches.  Do you know the artist that she's...  Guacamole.  Some music artist, Peaches.  Oh, well, yeah, they're best friends.  We're in San Cane.  Isn't she that fried that chicken?  No, no, it's a different Peaches.  Isn't that Peaches, though? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, it is.  That's poop like Peaches, I guess.  I told her I was Patrice when I came.  She's like, I know you.  I'm like, yeah, I'm Patrice.  She's like, Patrice?  Oh, yeah, she doesn't like Patrice.  She didn't have good things to say to him.  I don't like black people.  Al Pacino is really nice.  Al Pacino...  He raped me once, and then we went out for dinner.  Well, Al Pacino also hit on her, because he was staring at her, and then she said, what are you looking at?  And Pacino goes, well, I only stare at beautiful women.  I didn't have shoes on.  My shoes, so I was looking right at Twato. 
[03:21:00]  Maybe they're comparing wigs.  Yeah, the big wig!  Mick Jagger is a prick.  Alan Alda and his son are both jerks.  Sam Roberts is, quote, a scumbag phony.  Wow!  Oh, shit, let's get into that.  Is that you, or Sandy Kane?  No, that's Sandy Kane.  I was thinking it, and then she actually said it.  But no, that was actually Sandy.  And then she...  Wow, what happened, Sam?  What have you done to her that makes her think that you're a scumbag phony? 
[03:21:30]  She met him.  I guess she was unhappy with me, because she asked for my phone number last time she was here.  Oh, a little something going on between you two.  Maybe.  I think I gave her somebody else's office extension.  Jess Schmess, I'd say.  Sandy is the...  Sandy's where it's at.  Which extension did you give her?  I think Steve Sterniolo from Funny in the Morning.  There's a show called Funny in the Morning?  Yeah, Sonny Fox and Steve Sterniolo are funny in the morning.  Funny in the morning. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, God.  Is that really the music?  Yeah, it goes like this.  Funny in the morning.  No, it doesn't.  That's the jingle.  Can somebody get that?  I'd love to hear that.  Yeah, I really got to hear that.  I'm going to spit on...  Are we allowed to play to make fun of it?  Steve actually produces my Afternoon Raw show on fucking Thursday.  If that's the theme for that song, I'm going to spit on him.  What else, Danny?  Oh, man.  Let's see.  You want to go with Ron and Fez?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is a quote. 
[03:22:30]  This is not me saying it.  Don't take this out of context.  I'm making it into stuff.  I love Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez are so awful.  Ugh.  As people, they suck too.  Wow.  Sandy Kane doesn't like Ron and Fez.  She hates him.  She goes...  I don't even think Ronnie knows who she is.  She says, I'm a fan of radio and I hate them.  And then added, they're both faggots, right?  Holy shit.  Poor Ronnie.  Oh, no.  But yeah, she just would not stop running that mouth back there.  What does she have?  What problem does she have with them?  Has she ever done their show? 
[03:23:00]  Met them?  She said...  Oh, and she couldn't...  Also, she couldn't stop talking about this interview that she has later.  Like, she's so busy because she's running all over the place because she's such an A-lister now.  But the problem with Ronnie, I guess, was that they had her on one time.  And I guess they were, you know, just being Ron and Fez and she didn't like that, apparently.  Uh-huh.  And took offense to her.  And I guess Earl tried booking her once and there was miscommunications or something like that.  So she didn't like that.  Ron and Fez just has a lot of problems with everybody.  Enough, enough. 
[03:23:30]  Any other shit talking?  You know what?  I was furiously jotting things down that I missed a bunch of stuff.  Missed a few.  Yeah, I mean, there was a lot of shit talk going on.  Boy, oh, boy.  She's just back there.  What was Janine doing the whole time?  Just going, uh-huh.  She's trying to be as nice as could be.  Uh-huh, really?  You want to talk to Janine first before you...  Yeah, because she heard all this stuff.  That's who she was talking to.  Janine is the one that's doing all the makeup for the makeover.  This makeover is supposed to be like a kind of Britney Spears-looking makeover.  We wanted to make Sandy look as young as was humanly possible by doing things like, you 
[03:24:00]  know, pigtails and the Catholic school look.  Yeah.  Kind of like, was it the Hit Me Baby One More Time video?  Yep.  By Britney Spears, where we were watching it and just pretty much, I was pulling my  pud watching it, remembering how fucking hot she was in that video.  It's disturbing.  And now, to get Sandy Kane to that point, Janine, how close do you think you got? 
[03:24:30]  I think you may never pull your pud to the video again.  I will pull my pud to anything ever again after seeing the wonderful Sandy Kane.  Oh, I think we're pretty close.  Pretty close, huh?  I think you're going to have a hard time distinguishing the two.  Oh, yeah.  You'll stand back really, really, really far.  What did you have to do?  What were some of the techniques you used on Sandy?  Duct tape.  Lots and lots of duct tape.  Around the face?  Hopefully the nose and mouth area?  Believe it or not, around the face, I used bra straps and safety pins and more duct tape 
[03:25:00]  and sports tape.  Is this only going to be a frontal view that looks good?  Oh, no.  She's 360.  Oh, I thought everything was pulled back.  It is, but it's under stuff.  Oh, but then you put other stuff over it?  So she's got a little skirt on?  Oh, yeah.  What kind of underwear is it?  A G-string?  It looks like her Wonder Woman underwear that she wears in Times Square.  Oh, the, yeah.  The G-string was the only part I was not responsible for.  Uh-huh.  And I tried for the braces, but I was refused. 
[03:25:30]  I was denied.  By her?  Yeah.  She doesn't want to mess with her teeth.  Oh, she has a problem.  We forgot about that, remember?  She's obsessed with her teeth.  She has a problem.  Ah, my dentist raped me.  Ah, and then I spit and rinsed.  Ah.  She's been raped by everybody, apparently.  But this is boundaries.  But she has this horrible problem with the dentist because, what was the story?  She had gone to a dentist, and the dentist just started knocking her fucking teeth out.  What?  She just started talking.  It's like, yeah.  Ah, why you punch me and kick me? 
[03:26:00]  But yeah, the dentist just, like, really fucked with her mouth.  So now she really is self-conscious about anybody fucking with her.  She actually was, that might be why she kept telling me to be very careful around her lips.  And I was asking her, do I need to use, like, disposable items?  Yeah.  Is there something you're trying to tell me?  And she said, no, it's not, like, it's got nothing to do with disposable.  My mouth is fucked up.  I'm not going to tell you anymore.  Yeah.  So I guess she just has a...  She has dentist problems.  Wow. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Like traumatic dentist problems from her youth.  From her youth.  Is it safe?  She's sitting in the seat.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's safe.  Everything's safe.  Yeah, it's so safe.  Unbelievable.  Not very dangerous.  All right, so let's say you're not on the radio show.  You're still putting air conditioning units up, working in Long Island, making 40 grand,  50 grand a year.  I wish, but...  How much to bang her?  Would you do it for 10 grand? 
[03:27:00]  And you have to be sober.  Let me really get in the mindset I was back then, because I remember taking $20 out of  an ATM and being like, holy fuck, how am I going to pay a bill?  You know?  Right.  Like, ah.  And the 20 bucks was for the bar.  No.  10 grand cash.  No taxes.  It's in a suitcase.  Someone drops it off.  Nobody knows nothing.  You don't have to tell your friends, but you got to eat a box, too.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:27:30]  You got to eat a box.  That's the problem.  I was just going to start asking about rubbers and shit, and I'm like, I got to bare back  it.  No, you can wear a bag, but you got to eat a box for like five minutes first.  I could not do that.  I would throw up.  10 grand cash.  I would puke.  It's, I couldn't do it.  I couldn't fucking do it.  20.  God, to eat a, I'm tin knocking.  You're tin knocking.  That's about 30 grand.  And I'll play, I was making 27.5 a year. 
[03:28:00]  Okay.  So that's almost a year's salary.  A year's salary.  Oh, my God.  Let's see.  I'll throw in another 10 grand if you eat her ass.  Because that'd be 30.  I really needed money back then.  But I, I don't think I could.  I could say yes, and it would be like, all right, can you go on this fucking,  tossing, turning ship and not vomit, not get seasick? 
[03:28:30]  Like, I couldn't do it.  And sober.  It's a physical repulsion.  Yeah, yeah, sober, too.  You have to do it sober.  In the middle of the afternoon.  And by the way, that would be the last time I would be sober.  Anytime.  Like, I would never stop drinking.  I do stop occasionally.  Hours.  So, no, you don't do it.  No, I couldn't do it.  I couldn't do it.  And she's probably the only woman you could throw in front of me with that  offer that I would absolutely say no. 
[03:29:00]  Like, any other woman, I don't care.  Dig up Mama Cass Elliot's body.  Right.  And I'd fucking eat the ham sandwich and her ass.  Well, let's do the big reveal.  I'm going to see how close Janine got Sandy Kane to look like Britney Spears.  Here she comes.  Should we just open the door?  Do we have a little Hit Me Baby one more time?  Yeah.  All right.  Bring her in.  Ladies and gentlemen, Sandy Kane as Britney Spears. 
[03:29:30]  Let's see this.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  That is.  Oh, don't fall over.  Oh, my God.  What a.  They don't shake, though.  Wow.  Sandy.  The titties don't shake.  You don't even look like yourself.  I know.  You look.  A hundred years old.  Right.  Britney Spears corpse.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:30:00]  Thanks, Jim.  I'm sorry.  Wow.  So I don't look like Britney Spears corpse.  Now, that isn't your wig, right?  That's a.  No.  No.  My pussy's still real, though.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  And now you got the shirt tied up.  Yeah.  I still have my red, white, and blue shirt tied.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Late one naked cab girl.  And.  She even gave me a new belly button.  Oh, you gave her a higher one?  Yeah.  Why'd you give her a fake belly button, Janine?  It's easier than taping up the skin.  Oh, easier than taping up the skin. 
[03:30:30]  Okay.  All right.  So it's a fake belly.  She had to give her a fake belly button for a belly shirt.  Okay.  Now I'm looking at the picture of Britney from the video.  And now I'm looking at Sandy Kane.  While you're down there, Hope.  Wow.  It's uncanny.  While you're down there.  While you're down there.  Do you eat out?  Are you a lesbian?  Wow.  That's.  You are.  She goes.  I like how Sandy comes in here with our cardboard cameras from CBS. 
[03:31:00]  And I got my new CD called Sandy Kane is the Naked Cowgirl.  Yeah.  With I Love Dick on it.  Dedicated to my ex-husband.  Uh-huh.  Richard.  Dick left a bad taste in my mouth.  Oh, he did?  Yes.  Uh-huh.  But anyway, and also the controversial, he taught me how to love the one that the cowboy,  the naked cowboy asked him to put his voice on it.  Uh-huh.  And he said, if you give us $5,000 as a franchise fee, I'll put my voice on it. 
[03:31:30]  Well, he wants that for the Naked Cowgirl stuff.  Not so much to be on your CD, right?  He just wants fucking money.  He wants five G's from me.  $5,000 maybe.  Yeah, five large.  Five large.  Did you do a little spin?  Let me see what the back looks like.  Okay.  Let me see what you look like from the back.  That's fantastic.  Why is the back of her head so big?  She looks like one of the hiney-headed aliens from Star Trek.  We may have had to do a little bit of rigging.  I believe the episode was. 
[03:32:00]  She has some of her own hair up there.  No chick wants to hear that.  I know.  Smile while you see her.  Wow.  Yeah.  Give a sexy look for the camera.  All right.  Yeah.  Purse your lips.  It's not easy with the fucking tape taped up.  Yeah.  Like, what did she do to it?  Now, what did you do to Sandy's face there?  The eyes look older, though, and the face looks younger.  That's how you do it.  Is that what you saw?  The eyes, like, looked about 90, and the face looks younger. 
[03:32:30]  But it's just, you can't win, Jim.  You're talking like you have Bell's palsy.  What's going on?  Do you want to come over to that show?  Bell's palsy.  Whatever the fuck that is.  That's when your face kind of goes numb.  Yeah, yeah, it's late.  Yeah, yeah, it's late.  Yeah, yeah, it's late.  I got regular palsy.  Under the wig, there's an elastic band and lots of surgical and duct tape.  Oh, so you taped it to her face and then pulled it tight.  Yes, absolutely.  With, like, the bra strap, the contraption.  So is the bump on the back of her head skin? 
[03:33:00]  Yes, that's all bunched up with a scrunchie.  Just with a scrunchie.  Yeah, it is.  We actually, that's her hair under there.  It's a bun and...  Yes, some tape and stuff.  The girl that went into the White House in Mars Attacks with, uh, who'd she go in with?  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah, I can't remember his name now.  Yeah.  Well, everybody knows what you're talking about.  Yeah, that guy.  Because she had a big head under the wig.  Martin Short.  Thank you.  Martin Short.  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  How do you get his name?  Friends of Martin Short?  I love Martin Short.  Oh, no, no, you're saying short, like a dick size.  Yeah, and Sam Roberts, I asked him for his phone number, he gave me the wrong number.  So you don't like Sam Roberts?  Yeah, oh, bullshit, Sam.  Now, we heard a few things that you were mouthing off inside about a few people.  Ron and fucking Fez.  They asked me to blow a guy's dick once, and he had a big belly and shit, and I wouldn't  do it, and it was disgusting.  Was it Polo?  He had a big, a big belly and a short cock.  Was he the one that... 
[03:34:00]  I take offense to that.  When me and that gym were there, you were there, remember?  No, they wanted me to blow his dick.  No, because Polo, I think, licked and kissed Twato, right?  That guy?  Yes.  So why didn't you return the favor?  Yeah.  Well, it's why...  And that's why you hate Ron and Fez, and you're taking care of me.  I wouldn't mind blowing your dick, but not this fat guy that, you know, had a big belly.  Big belly.  I think it was Polo.  That belly in his.  Come on, blow it.  Don't do it.  But you know they're doing a radio show.  Why don't you like Ron and Fez?  You know, there's something been on my mind. 
[03:34:30]  New subject.  I better not...  I don't know.  There was, like, this comic once that got me down at Dangerfield.  Did he rape you?  He took his dick out, and he said, suck it, suck it.  He's a major comic in New York.  So when you were done...  You know, I'm afraid that he might do it to other women, and I'm thinking of coming out  of the closet with this.  Well, not on this show with a name.  Can she write it down and hold it up?  Yeah, write the name down.  Yeah, the biggest cock I ever saw in my life.  All right, so it wasn't Rich Voss.  It wasn't Rich Voss. 
[03:35:00]  It wasn't Bob Kelly.  He's a small dick.  Yeah, write it down.  I'll tell you.  Write it down.  I'll tell you.  Don't say, though.  Just don't say.  Don't say, because we get a lot of trouble.  You don't want to be held liable.  You're being sued in lawsuits, right?  Yeah, you've got enough lawsuits to do it.  I don't know, but any comic that someone said they have a big dick on the radio might...  That's true.  It's probably not going to sue.  It takes the good with the bad, I guess, right?  I'll say.  Wait, where'd you scroll on that paper?  She stole it.  Oh, okay.  I can see this happening.  Really?  He's a cock?  Let me see.  I don't know if you know him.  I had opened the door. 
[03:35:30]  He locked the door, and he kept sulking, sulking, sulking.  It sounds like...  Because I was looking.  Tremendous cock.  It wasn't a dick, Jim.  It was a cock.  Okay.  You know who that is?  You know who it is?  I don't know if you could read her.  Is he?  No, I could read her.  Is he?  I would assume he's a Hispanic gentleman.  Okay.  Yeah.  With a big, giant, big cock.  Tremendous cock.  So why were you upset with that?  I thought you liked sucking cock.  No. 
[03:36:00]  They locked the door.  He wouldn't let me out of the green room.  And, you know, Rodney Dangerfield's club, it was.  When was this?  Like, how long ago?  Well, not that long ago, because I had my public access show.  I was looking for comics for my public access show.  Yeah.  And he said, come on down to the green room.  We'll talk.  I said, okay, you know.  So I remember Rodney in his bathrobe.  Why not?  And I worked for Dangerfield's as a comic.  So I looked down.  He locked the door.  Locked the fucking door.  And we sat down on the couch. 
[03:36:30]  He said, don't worry about it.  Just have a seat.  And then he opened his flight, took his big dick out.  And he said, suck it.  Suck it.  Suck it.  It's a true story.  And I said, no, no.  It's a true story, Paul.  Yeah, suck it, suck it, suck it.  Suck it, suck it.  And, you know, just I'm thinking of that he's, the guy is a fucking sickie.  And I hope he's not doing it to other, other women's.  Well, he probably, you probably were thrown off a vibe.  No, I wasn't.  That you would suck a cock. 
[03:37:00]  No, well, as being an ex-stripper.  Yeah, you usually say things, you say provocative things that would lead people to believe that, perhaps you, you know.  Yeah, would you do that?  You would just suck a dick.  Lock a door and take your dick out?  In certain circumstances, if there was someone in there that was, like, really being like you are a lot of times, you run your mouth.  You would do that?  You run your mouth and you say, I'll suck dick.  I probably would.  No, I was just looking for comics, no, for my public access show.  And he said, that's a very, I was thinking of going to the cops. 
[03:37:30]  You had a tippy tom's dick, though.  Oh.  I did not.  I think you might have.  I think you might have a little bit.  No, I think you went down on him a little.  No, please.  Come on, man.  Oh, you gave him a hand job.  Oh, you gave him a hand job.  A little tug.  What about club soda?  A finger job.  What about club soda?  Kenny, would you suck his dick?  Yeah, what about club soda?  He's right there.  No, not at all.  Why?  Why should I? 
[03:38:00]  Would you suck it?  Would you suck it?  It depends.  What do you mean depends?  Do you think he's good looking or you're attracted to him?  You can't say, would you suck it?  It's guy, guy.  He's got the biggest, I mean, he's very attractive in the dark.  Oh.  Shit.  Kenny.  Club soda, Kenny.  Look at that smile on his face.  What's this world coming to?  You know, I mean, he doesn't sing Monster Mash good, but.  Kenny's out.  I will take that from her.  Okay.  Oh.  You want a blowjob?  It's actually a good thing to say. 
[03:38:30]  Every woman wants a guy that's tall, he's in shape, he's muscular.  He is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you suck it.  I'm a guy, though.  But he's a guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I don't like to suck cock, to be honest.  Why?  What's the matter with you?  I'm not, I'm not, I just, I'm not really into it.  But you're always talking about it.  I used to be.  You used to be?  What stopped it?  What's stopping me?  Just, you know, maybe, maybe I got to meet the right guy.  Yeah, but what, like, why did you like it?  Now you don't.  Um, well, um, in fact, I have a good song on my CD called You Hit My G-Spot. 
[03:39:00]  About, it's G-O-D, about, you know, sucking cock and, and just kind of, when you finally  meet the guy that, that, uh, triggers your G-Spot.  Jim.  When was the last time you swallowed, uh, cum?  Swallowed cum.  Uh, when was the last time?  There is something on my CD.  Oh, yeah, George Clooney.  George Clooney's song.  Well, but when was the last time you swallowed a load of gist?  Do you know, you want to be honest? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah.  I have never swallowed cum.  What?  Jewish girls don't swallow.  No, I have never swallowed.  You would always spit?  Yeah, spit out.  Like with David Brenner.  David Brenner.  Yeah.  We don't know this.  I mean.  You don't know David Brenner?  No, we know David Brenner.  Well, I'm just saying.  Someone has to fucking step in.  I have no idea.  That's fine.  So what happened with David Brenner?  No, David Brenner, though, I was mainly in love with him, and I sucked his dick.  And he was the worst lover in the world. 
[03:40:00]  And when I was spitting at the cum in the sink, the door slammed.  Wait, why'd the door slam?  He left.  But you really like him?  David Brenner rules.  Oh, I was mainly in love.  He fucking rules.  He just slammed the fucking door.  I was...  He fucking rules while she's over a sink.  Wait, but you must have been...  Were you very sad about that, right?  Oh, very, very, Jim.  Were you embarrassed?  Well, no.  I was spitting the cum out, and it was a door fucking slams.  But I mean, like, you like him, right? 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Lawrence, do you think that's the worst insult ever?  He certainly didn't reciprocate.  No, I wish there were stories about me like that.  He did not reciprocate.  Did you feel used?  Oh, yes, definitely.  I felt...  And then I tried to do him again, and he definitely wouldn't even come back.  Did you ever feel bad that you put yourself in those positions where you're like, you're  just being kind of mistreated?  Always.  But, you know, what can I say?  Sometimes you like someone too much, and they don't, you know, sometimes the ones that  don't like you, you don't like, and then the ones that you like don't like you. 
[03:41:00]  Do you think if you would have swallowed, he would have stayed?  That's a good question.  Yeah.  Good fucking question.  Great question.  So, would you have?  Do you think that?  Maybe, man.  Thank you.  I needed that.  What if a guy, I'm sure in your career, a guy has probably shot one right into the back  of your throat?  You can't spit it out.  What happened then?  No, it never happened.  I never had you.  So, I'll have to ask Jill about that. 
[03:41:30]  I'll have to ask Jill.  That was a while ago.  But, yeah, I know.  So, are you still going with 18-year-olds or what?  You know.  Is that for Jim or Anthony?  I've opened up my spectrum.  Would you suck Jim Norton's penis?  Oh, definitely.  You would?  He gave me, remember you touched my titty, he gave me a breast feel once.  Did I really?  Very good.  Very.  Oh, you wouldn't swallow his?  Maybe.  It depends.  It depends.  Did her tit feel like a Stretch Armstrong doll?  I don't remember.  Okay. 
[03:42:00]  I don't remember.  Okay.  I blocked it out the way one does when they're in an airline accident.  They just, all of a sudden, they're having peanuts, and then they're in the hospital.  Ah, Sandy.  What a life you've led.  Why don't you write a book?  I really should.  You've got so many stories of rape and dentistry.  No, but I think that my CD, you know, my CD really speaks for a lot of my life. 
[03:42:30]  Does it?  He taught me how to love.  CD called Borses.  It was about going from town to town and getting laid and getting my heart broken, and then  going to another town, getting my heart broken.  Have you ever been in love, Sandy?  Oh, always.  No, I mean reciprocal love.  That, uh...  See, because you were in love with David Brenner.  Yeah, I was in love with David Brenner.  And he walked out while you were spitting his cum out in the sink.  Yeah, yeah.  And slammed the door.  Yeah.  Not even trying to make a quiet escape. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah.  Who are you in love with?  Who are you in love with?  Yeah.  So, who am I in love with?  Who are you in love with?  Who are you?  I'm in love with the naked cowgirl.  No, but who are you in love with with the reciprocal love?  Oh, who was I in love with besides David Brenner?  Yeah.  For real.  Uh, I'm in love right now.  Oh.  With who?  With Opie.  Oh.  And besides Opie, I'm in love with...  I love this pastor who lives in Detroit.  Yeah.  His name is, uh, Pastor...  I shouldn't...  Pastor Tim...  That's all right.  I got it.  I got it.  We have a spiritual, um, G-spot relationship. 
[03:43:30]  And, you know, so I'm still...  Well, that's good.  No, in the past, though, I'm talking.  In the past.  Yeah.  Celebrities.  Things like that.  What is your...  Dick Sean.  Dick Sean.  Dick Sean.  Dick Sean died on stage, by the way.  I know.  Yes.  I was...  I was going with Dick Sean.  Yeah?  I wrote I Love Dick.  And that was from...  For Dick Sean?  Dick Sean...  Well, truthfully, it was not for every Dick, really, but...  How was Dick Sean?  Dick Sean...  Was he a good lover?  He...  When he came, he used to pop Amy and Nitrates. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he would just say, do you want some?  I go, no, thanks, Dick.  Uh-huh.  But we got used to get stoned on peyote buttons and have sex.  Yeah.  What about Rodney Danifield when you worked at club?  Did he ever hit on you?  Now, Rodney, I never fucked, but he wanted me once.  I was in L.A. and at the Hyatt house, and he said, come on.  I'm here to...  Come on.  I want you to jump off the roof.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  We want to see if you'd bounce, okay? 
[03:44:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying about this comic that molested me.  It was really a smear for Rodney Dangerfield.  But, what was I going to say?  Rodney and I were in a room, and he wanted me to suck his cock or something.  But he...  Or something.  The something was, get out.  No, but I just, you know, because he knew I was...  I liked David Brenner and Steve Landisberg, who was...  I was going with Steve Landisberg.  Oh, wow.  Do you remember?  Oh, yeah.  He was on Barney Miller for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  He was my boyfriend. 
[03:45:00]  Really?  Wait, was he...  Oh, yeah.  He really was?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  You're panicking.  How long did you date him for?  I dated him for three straight months, and then he...  Three straight months.  Oh, no.  Yeah, and then he cheated on me with Louise Lasser.  Ooh.  But then you married Hartman.  Then you got him back by fucking eating fucking Abe Vagoda's ass.  And she let woad come in her face.  Woad.  And she sucked ass hair out of Barney Miller's mustache.  Because Barney had been ass-nuzzling other men. 
[03:45:30]  She sucked Jack Sue's little Asian penis.  Yeah.  That's what the fucking theme music is.  It's her pussy lips.  Boom.  Boom, boom, boom.  But anyway, he was a virgin.  Steve Landisberg was a virgin when I met him.  Yeah.  So we used to take quaaludes.  He had to.  We took quaaludes.  She's like, I want to fuck.  He's like, what do you got?  I need some.  Give me 10 of the yellow ones.  And he was a virgin until he met me, and then... 
[03:46:00]  Long after you, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah.  And then, after he, you know, I taught him what to do, he went to Louise Lasser, and...  Did he do the same thing with her?  And by that, I mean, run through the door like Herman Munster.  She dumped him, and then he came back to me.  There was a Landisberg outline at the fucking door.  She dumped him, and then he came back to me.  Ah.  And then I wouldn't take him back.  No.  Ah, you kind of put your whole hoof down.  Yes.  I should have, though.  I should have taken him back. 
[03:46:30]  Ah, you regret that now, right?  Sure.  Yeah.  Why not?  So he cheated, so.  What other celebrities over the years?  You know, Richard Pryor.  Yeah, I heard about the Richard Pryor story.  And what's his name, the guy, what's his name from, uh, from, uh, Red Fox show?  What was that?  Red Fox.  Red Fox.  Yeah, DeMond.  Did you fuck DeMond Wilson?  Oh, yeah.  Grady.  Big dick.  Or Rollo.  Did you fuck Rollo?  Not Rollo, man.  Or a goat.  No.  DeMond had a big dick, and we snorted cocaine all night in the Hollywood Hills. 
[03:47:00]  You fucked DeMond Wilson?  Yes.  He was great.  That's pretty impressive, I think, huh?  How about Bubba?  Damn, that is a big one.  Not Red Fox, not Red Fox, no.  Did DeMond Wilson have just a giant cock?  And he lived, um, in this beautiful, in Beverly Hills, he had a whole big floor, because he  was, um, on, um, Sanford and Son.  And he had a whole floor, and he said, I hate the fucking show.  He said, and we snorted cocaine all night. 
[03:47:30]  I wanted to give him a Quaalude, he wouldn't take it.  But cocaine he was in, too.  Now he's a reverend, by the way.  Yes, yes, yes.  After that, I'm sure he went right to God.  It's like fucking Anastas negative.  He had, like, a rosary beetle in his car, and, uh, he, um, he hated the show, and he  never really worked after that, remember?  He became a pastor.  Oh.  I just...  That's what he said he should have done, he should have passed.  Oh, shit.  He loved Jesus, he was into Jesus then, and he hated the show. 
[03:48:00]  Meanwhile, he had a whole floor.  The show is what got him everything.  I know, but...  Uh, Sandy, uh, some people are asking questions, uh, they want to know how Stan Laurel was in  bed.  Exactly.  I didn't do him, but I did Hardy.  Yeah, I bet.  He was small, very small dick there.  Yeah, yeah.  And, and what's his name, um, W.C. Fields was...  Yeah, yeah, he must have been good.  He was hot, man.  Burying his schnoz up in your eye.  Always drunk, always drunk. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Any other big celebrities we, uh, know about from the...  Uh, yeah, let me think about it.  ...from the 60s and 70s?  Sounds like a wild time with Sandy King.  Woody Allen, though.  Um, no.  Who else can I think of?  But were you in love with all these guys, the Hollywood guys?  Demond Wilson?  I love Demond.  Were you in love with them?  Really?  He was, like, the only black guy there.  Did he pick you up in a pickup truck?  No, he had a, you know, in a car.  Did you, uh, did, was it weird back then?  A white girl and a black guy walking around? 
[03:49:00]  Uh...  Or celebrity and an animal.  I don't remember, but he was a celebrity, so it didn't, you know, it was alright.  Yeah.  You could fuck a black guy.  Even my mother was terrible with Richard Pryor, so...  Yeah, she liked him?  Yeah, and then when he, yeah, then when he blew himself up, remember Richard Pryor?  You know, and Jimmy Walker.  Hold on, can we go back to that riveting exchange?  Did you fuck Jimmy J.J. Walker?  Not really.  Not really, but I was in the Carnegie Deli with my parents, and Jimmy Walker walked in, 
[03:49:30]  and, and, um, I talked to him, hi, Jimmy, you know, and my parents were appalled that  I speak to a black guy, you know, they...  Jesus.  Yeah, yeah, it was horrible.  At least he had somewhat of a good upbringing.  And then, when he was on TV, my, my mother was, like, laughing hysterically at good times,  and she said, oh, is he funny?  I said, Ma, remember we met him at the Carnegie, and you would, you said I shouldn't talk to  him?  Ah.  So, yeah.  It's like a life lesson learned from Mom.  Yeah, yeah, isn't it?  Right.  She said, oh, he's funny, though.  Yeah?  So, I said...  You didn't fuck him, though, right?  No.  No, he was very, he was best friends with David and, uh, Steve Landisberg. 
[03:50:00]  They were, like, you know, and then when Jimmy made it, he was, like, the biggest snob.  He was, like, you couldn't talk to him after he got good times.  He was the nicest guy, and then, the minute he got good times, you couldn't even talk to  him.  Oh, wow.  That was Jimmy Walker.  Well, one time she, uh...  You should save some of this for the book.  Yeah.  She showed her her vagina, and he said it looked like it was blown up with dynamite.  No, he...  Jimmy, you know, when Jimmy, Jimmy Walker said, you know, you're a really beautiful girl. 
[03:50:30]  And I love you, because you're down to earth.  I just saw Al Pacino on the street.  I gave him my...  Did you?  Yeah, I was...  Yeah!  Yeah, yeah.  Hoo-ah!  Hoo-ah!  And, uh, I gave him my first CD, Cindy Kane is the Naked Cowgirl.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, and I, you know, I said, Al, I always see you, and here's the fucking CD.  And he was sitting with a lot of people, um, and he's just trying to be down to earth.  And I said, you're the greatest actor in the world, Al. 
[03:51:00]  And he said, just one of them.  And I said, no, you are the greatest.  I loved it.  And then I went, hoo-ha!  Trying to get you away.  Yes, he's a great guy.  I took three pictures.  I'll let you see him next time I see you.  Oh!  You have a picture of Pacino?  Yeah.  Three pictures.  She's got a development.  I said to him, you want a lap dance?  Yeah.  He said, no, you stay over there.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, but anyway, I came near him, and we took a picture.  He was sitting down, and I'll show you, you know, and then-  Was he nice? 
[03:51:30]  Ah, Al Pacino's a great fucking guy.  Did you ever meet him?  No.  Very down to earth.  He was sitting with a lot of people, man, just ordinary people.  A lot of people.  He didn't whip his dick out.  No, I wanted him to, but-  We're all down to earth.  Yeah, exactly.  It's called gravity.  You know, he's very down to earth.  We're very down to earth.  Yeah, we get it.  And he looked real young.  I said, who's your plastic surgeon?  Or even of it.  Who's your plastic surgeon?  Write it down.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  You're thinking of a little plastic surgery?  Yes.  What do you want to have done? 
[03:52:00]  What do you think?  When you look in the mirror in the morning, do you see a reflection?  No.  Just a floating hatch.  Just a wig in mid-air.  Anthony, it ain't easy a lot of times looking in the mirror.  It's like The Shining, that old lady in The Shining.  She gets out of the tub all slow.  It's not easy looking in the mirror these days.  Kisses Nicholson.  Yeah.  It's not easy.  Goes and tears a young boy's sweater.  Even when I'm in Times Square as a naked cowboy, and people are throwing me money, and it's like, boy, you look good, they tell me. 
[03:52:30]  And it's still not easy looking in the mirror.  Sandy, when you look in the mirror, what do you want changed about yourself?  What is it?  Okay.  This part of me is, like, really saggy.  You're pointing to your whole face when you say that.  What do you know?  I like my eyes.  I think my eyes are cool.  You want your eyes to be, well, what do you want done?  I feel.  Because there's things.  There's facelift.  There's a nose job.  There's fucking chin implant.  Yeah.  Really?  Eye pull back.  Whatever.  So what do you want done? 
[03:53:00]  Like, what's the most important thing you think?  This part.  Right here.  Right here.  Like your cheeks and your chin.  She's just pointing to her forehead and the five foot seven inches below it.  You know, and just, yeah, this part.  You know, I'm talking to this plastic surgeon.  You remember you had a doctor on.  She wrote a book.  Kevorkian.  She wrote a book.  She had her tits done.  Remember?  Olivia. 
[03:53:30]  It was just gone.  She had her tits done.  She certainly did.  She had her tits done.  Done and laughed off.  And she had her face done and you couldn't tell.  You don't remember her?  She had, she wrote a book.  Oh, Victoria's a drop.  Right.  It was the Russian brood.  Yeah.  She was Russian?  Yeah.  Anyway, so she gave me the name of plastic surgeon to give the one hour facelift.  And I've been talking to him.  Yeah.  The guy with a shovel in an alley. 
[03:54:00]  Sandy, what would you give yourself?  What would you give yourself on a scale of one to ten?  Ten being the hardest.  Yes.  Well, when I'm making money, a naked cowgirl in Times Square, I give myself a ten.  No, I'm just saying.  On the Richter.  Just saying a good joke.  When you look in the mirror, what would you give yourself?  Well, when I look in the mirror, I said, gee, this part of my face looks younger, but  my eyes look older.  Wow.  So it's like she did something, but the bags are more accentuated.  There's nothing really you can do about that unless you go into, have surgery. 
[03:54:30]  Well, what I'm saying is.  Then they cut that loose skin out.  There's one, yeah.  Yeah, so there's one thing that she held, but then the bags get bigger, so.  Could they do anything with the bags under the eyes?  Maybe make a cloak out of them?  Flesh cloak?  Pack them.  My bags are packed.  I'm packing my bags.  Okay.  Yeah, we get that.  There we go.  My bags are packed, the ones under my eyes.  So that's what you'd have done, like a little facelift.  Your legs look good?  That's good.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, jeez. 
[03:55:00]  All right.  So your legs aren't bad.  From the kneecaps down.  Yeah.  I have beautiful knees.  You really do.  You're going to go to Times Square dressed as Britney Spears?  I wish the Irish Republican Army would notice that.  No way, Opie.  No?  No way.  This could be your new look for Times Square.  I'm doing a Dutch interview today about the lawsuit that Robert Burke and the Naked Cowboys.  So I'm doing Dutch TV.  Where are we out with the lawsuit?  You're still performing in Times Square?  Yes, I still am.  I wish you were a Dutch playwright when you wrote something about his law. 
[03:55:30]  People think Robert Burke chased me out of Times Square.  He certainly didn't.  There I am.  You're still in Times Square.  Definitely.  You'll be there later today?  I will be there today.  Selling CDs?  Yeah, I'll sell some CDs.  Why not?  Thank you.  I needed that.  They are really gorgeous.  And, you know, he said write a book.  But there's a lot about my life.  Right on the CD.  Right on the CD.  How did they get the CD, Sandy Kane?  How did they get it?  Yeah.  Can we play a song for a minute?  I've got to hear a track.  Yeah, we're going to end the show with one of Sandy Kane's songs. 
[03:56:00]  Well, um...  How did they get it, first of all?  It's on Sexy Records with a lot of X's.  Yeah, it's me.  Oh, really?  It's my own label.  Sexy Records?  Yes.  Who do you have signed to your label?  Just me.  Yes, ugly CDs was taken.  No, it's just Sexy Records.  It's my own label.  And I will be out in Times Square with some if anyone wants to buy.  And they're not really available on anything yet.  Best way to do a CD. 
[03:56:30]  Keep it under your hat.  Don't put it under your underwear.  It's not on iTunes or anything.  No.  Well, why don't you get it somewhere?  I don't know how to do it.  I don't know how to do it.  But anyway, I would love to, if you hear it, and just tell me which one.  If you love I Love Dick or Glory of the Queen from Astoria is great.  Which is the hit single, would you say?  Well, the controversial one with Robert Berg is he taught me how to love it.  Very controversial.  Very controversial.  Has it actually got him on there?  No. 
[03:57:00]  There is someone on there.  And I said to him, why not put your voice on it?  He said, I will for a $5,000 franchise fee.  Right.  And my lawyer has gotten, like, he's a real fraud, Robert Berg the Cowboy.  He's a fucking hype.  He says his company is this and that.  They do radio shows.  They do TV shows.  They have sports celebrities.  They do all this shit.  And my lawyer has uncovered that he's a total fraud.  He doesn't do any of that. 
[03:57:30]  I think I've seen him on some news shows, though.  Yeah, but he doesn't have his own show.  He doesn't have a show.  I don't know who he is, though.  He's pretty famous.  Yeah, he's so.  So is Sandy.  Hello.  He's got a better ass than you, too.  Oh.  I don't think so.  Let me see.  Smaller cock.  Better ass.  Oof.  Wow.  American flag shorts.  I was just thinking that.  The American flag shorts.  The fucking American flag is treated better in Tehran during a protest. 
[03:58:00]  I can't tell you, man, that the naked cowboy should show his fucking ass crack  or a ball or something.  Instead of suing fucking people.  What?  You should wear a thong or something.  Show a fuck that he's a fucking ass.  Holy shit, are you getting better than that today?  You don't think so?  Yeah, I know.  Instead of suing fucking people, wear a fucking thong.  Show a ball.  Keep performing down there.  Show a ball.  Yeah, do something like that.  Instead of suing me, because I'm showing, now I'm topless in Times Square.  What do you wear?  Pasties?  Yes. 
[03:58:30]  How's that working out for you?  It's good.  More money.  Yeah?  Yeah, they love it.  I take pictures with little kids, man.  What tourists from, like, where are the ones that come up to you the most, do you think?  By the way, my friend was on a bus yesterday, and she heard people talking about me.  I thought it was too Japanese, but...  No, I'm just saying, I know you're...  But she said they were talking about the naked cowgirl, how he's suing me, and that she's  much better than him.  She's talented.  But what?  What group comes up to you the most?  What type of tourists?  Where are they from?  Oh, Australians.  Yeah.  Brazil. 
[03:59:00]  Brazilians.  A lot of people.  Italians, Tiamo, French.  Everybody would enjoy a safari.  Who comes up?  You know, people that have, you know, all kinds of people you meet in Times Square.  Asian people.  A lot of Asians take pictures with you?  Yeah, I love it.  They love their cameras.  Yes.  You know...  Do you think she's Godzilla?  Australians.  People from England.  And where do you stand?  What corner?  On 46th Street and Broadway.  That's exactly where the Muslim terrorist dropped off his car.  Oh, yeah.  No, I was there.  He was trying.

You were in Times Square on 6.30 on a Saturday?  Yes.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I was there.  I was there.  I walked right by that van.  You and a million other people.  Because I always walk by that street with a lot of money.  I was going, oh, see, it's a great day today.  Oh, that's good.  Why don't you let that out, that you always walk by there with a lot of money?  Yeah, the money would have gone flying, man.  No, I'm just saying.  I would have been blown up.

For senior citizens.  They would want to see your flying saucer license.  Well, you got a CD out, Santa Cade, that no one could get.  Yeah, that no one could get, unfortunately.
