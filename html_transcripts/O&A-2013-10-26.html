<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting a “Worst of the Week” countdown segment.  This segment featured extensive coverage of a “sponge bath” given to the recurring character Bobo, naked, by porn star Lexi Love in a Rubbermaid container filled with bubble bath.  The segment included detailed descriptions of this event, Bobo's reactions, and Lexi Love's actions.  Numerous in-studio guests were present throughout the show, including John McEnroe, Ron Howard, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Bobby Slayton.  Jenna Jameson was also discussed, having a noteworthy appearance later in the show.  McEnroe's interview touched upon his personal life (including his children and marriages), his views on sportsmanship, and his relationships with various athletes.  Jim Norton's absence was noted, and his views on parenthood were contrasted with McEnroe's.  The segment was interspersed with numerous commercials for various products and services, including smoking cessation spray, gym franchises, tax lawyers, dating services, and men's health products.  Bobo's comedic interjections during an interview with Bobby Slayton were also a feature of the countdown.

The show continued with a conversation with returning guest Bobby Slayton, filled with off-color jokes and interruptions.  Topics included increasing peanut allergies (with speculation about desensitization), Lexi Love's sponge bath of Bobo (with repeated jokes about Bobo's penis size and Lexi's actions), Bobo's loss of virginity, Slayton's daughter's career as a Pussycat Doll (now GRL), Slayton's experiences hosting the Porn Awards, his encounters with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, and a lengthy critique of other radio stations' pre-written bits ("PrepBurger"), including a poor Obama and John Travolta impression.  The segment included jokes about "gluten-free pussy" and a story about Slayton's daughter's reaction to meeting Mick Jagger. Lexi Love was present in the studio during this segment.

A significant portion of the show focused on inconsiderate parking, followed by an interview with Jenna Jameson.  The parking segment featured a humorous "Public Ryan Announcement" criticizing drivers who hog parking spaces with large vehicles.  The Jameson interview turned emotional as she discussed a difficult custody battle with her ex-husband,  including allegations of violence and limited access to her children.  The conversation also covered her career in the adult film industry, her current projects (including a book), and difficulties in dating.  Lighthearted moments included comments on her appearance and a humorous exchange about meatloaf.  Ron Howard and Neil deGrasse Tyson made brief appearances during this segment; Tyson briefly discussed extraterrestrial life and human intelligence.  The segment included various commercials.

Ron Howard’s interview discussed his work on *Heart of the Sea*, a Canon-sponsored project of short films (including one by his daughter Bryce Dallas Howard), and his experiences directing Tom Hanks.  He commented on technology's impact on filmmaking and television.  Later, a Myers-Briggs personality test of Rich Vos (INTJ) and Bonnie McFarlane (INTP) was discussed with Dr. Steve, leading to humorous arguments between Vos and McFarlane based on their personality types. Dr. Steve offered communication advice. Commercials aired throughout.

The final segment featured Rich Vos and Bonnie McFarlane discussing their contrasting approaches to packing and organizing hotel rooms, leading to playful arguments about their perceived character flaws (Vos calling McFarlane "frigid," McFarlane calling Vos a "whore").  The discussion explored their contrasting personalities and how they manage their differences.  The segment included commercials for Adam & Eve, Papa John's, and a tax services company.

[00:03:30]  Seasoning face.  You know what time it is.  It's the weekend's worst of the week countdown time with me, Sam Roberts, highlighting everything good that happened on the Opianity Show this week.  Of course, we had A-lister Ron Howard in studio.  We had Neil deGrasse Tyson in studio explaining the universe to everybody.  Bobo made his triumphant return to the Opianity Show.  Plus, Jenna Jameson breaks down like nothing you've ever seen before.  But we're going to start the countdown, I want to get to John McEnroe, great in-studio guest, tennis legend, legendary temper. 
[00:04:00]  He once had a television show.  It didn't last long, but Opianity and Anthony did it.  They have an immediate connection there.  He was a great guest.  John McEnroe, here on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  We'll be right back. 
[00:04:30]  I hate all this sportsmanship.  It's too much sportsmanship.  I did have, since this is satellite, and you guys like racy stuff.  Oh, sure.  I'll give you, and Jim mentioned this, that as a, I was brought up Catholic.  I'm going to say something I never told anyone. 
[00:05:00]  A number of years ago, the priest that was in my parish was arrested for inappropriate activity.  So, and I was unaware of this.  Uh-oh.  So my mom calls me and says, John, did you hear, I'm not going to mention names, did you hear about the father?  And I said, no, I didn't.  Well, he was arrested for, you know, child molesting, et cetera.  So I go, God, that's too bad.  That's horrible.  I mean, I never would have thought that with him. 
[00:05:30]  And then she says, there was this hesitation.  And then she said, did he ever do anything to you?  And then I realized, Jim, that could have been my out for everything I'd ever done.  And sometimes we still get together.  Maybe you're angry because he didn't.  Did you, uh, recently it came out that, uh, that people saying that Bobby Riggs had thrown that big match with Boy Jean King. 
[00:06:00]  Well, we always thought that.  Oh, you did?  Really?  We always thought that because he, he's a huge gambler.  I mean, I played Bobby Riggs in golf once.  Me and Arthur Ashe beat Jimmy Connors and Bobby Riggs in golf.  And they wouldn't pay us.  They said, let's keep playing another nine holes.  We don't want to play anymore.  We want the money.  And then they wouldn't, you're not paying us.  Well, that's because you won't keep playing.  So it was, he was one of these guys that always was hustling.  And he beat Margaret Court, who happened to be one of the top female players before he played Billie Jean King badly. 
[00:06:30]  But he was a rather agey guy.  Actually, he was somewhere in the neighborhood of how old I am now.  I think he was 55, 56, possibly, when he played Billie Jean King.  And the way he played, how pathetic he performed, made guys believe, or maybe we wanted to believe,  that this pathetic performance was due to the fact, and we were, rumor had it, that he had done this. 
[00:07:00]  Now, having now at 54 years of age and the body sort of giving out more often, you can see why there'd be certain days where it wouldn't be that great a day where you could possibly have had a bad day.  And I would say that it's a little bit harder to say definitively that did happen, although I'd like to check his bank account and see.  But I think...  Get some money down on her, yeah.  Well, it turned out great for, I mean, obviously, girls' sports.  I mean, I have four girls and two boys. 
[00:07:30]  You raised them all, right?  I did raise them all.  Not by myself.  Patty Smythe and I have been together for 19...  Yeah, six kids.  Wow.  Two marriages, yeah.  Wow.  So that is a loud dinner table.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  Crazy.  Because I had all the kids, you know, I had full custody of the three.  I had retained them for a long time, 15, the last 15 years.  And so there was some definite energy flowing at the table.  A lot of, yeah, maybe possibly yelling and screaming a bit, but in a loving way. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  In a loving way, yeah.  In a loving way.  It's great to have kids.  It keeps you sort of, some sort of good perspective.  What about you, Jim?  What's your story?  Never had kids.  Never even came.  I feel like I'm, I realize what it is.  I'm, A, I'm a sex addict, but B, I think I'm afraid of, like, once you get married, once  you have kids, then adulthood starts.  And even though I know intellectually where I'm at in my life, I'm fucking close to being  finished, but I'm just, it scares me to acknowledge that in a way that's undeniable. 
[00:08:30]  Like, with a kid, you can't deny that that kid's getting older and you're getting older.  I think that's what's freaked me out.  Or maybe I'm just selfish and I don't like taking care of everything.  Well, that's it.  Yeah, yeah, me too.  It's probably both.  It's a little of both.  I'm very sure, though.  What about the fact that you're not going to have a little one?  Don't you want to have someone, like a little Jim Norton?  I don't know.  It's only good to you.  Wouldn't that be unbelievable to see that?  It's kind of cool, I gotta tell you.  See if the apple didn't fall far from the tree?  Yeah.  Just a check.  It's kind of cool.  I got, I got two.  Oh, my friends are all happy that Moby's got one. 
[00:09:00]  But Anthony and Colin Quinn are my last two holdouts of people.  They're going to have one together.  Never come in, Colin.  We're working on it.  We're trying.  We're working on it every day.  Yeah, Colin is fighting homosexuality at every turn.  Because Colin's not married and he has no kids.  He hasn't been married, but he has no kids.  So a couple of my friends are still holding out.  But, yeah, I don't know.  I just got a kitten.  Is that count?  You prefer hookers and strippers, right?  You know why?  Because I hear all your stories and it just sounds like you've never been with a girl that hasn't at least stripped. 
[00:09:30]  From what I've heard.  I don't know if that's true or not.  I think you're right.  Can you imagine in a normal, maybe they are normal.  Yeah, there's no Kmart cashier that wants this life.  I think you're right there.  You've got to give me an answer to that, though.  Before, I always wanted to ask you that.  What was the question?  The question was, have you ever, I mean, you obviously prefer strippers and hookers.  Sometimes I do.  But sometimes, no, there's times where I like, it's hard for me because my threshold is so high with what I need to, not even to get off, but just to be stimulated. 
[00:10:00]  That it's hard to find regular girls who can kind of go to that.  But I've had a few girlfriends who just read men really well.  And a girl who can, like, own you, that's what I want.  And usually women in the sex business understand the male mentality enough to kind of know what you want.  And I don't even mean just sexually, but, like, mentally when you're fantasizing.  But that's the physical side of a relationship.  Have you ever felt like you've been in love?  He doesn't respect a girl. 
[00:10:30]  Once she goes to that level, he probably doesn't want to hang out with a regular girl.  I love my ex-girlfriend very much.  I loved the girl before her, who was just a really nice girl and not a pervert.  I loved both of them tremendously and truly.  But my selfishness overrode my love.  While you were loving them truly, were you out with strippers and hookers?  Well, yeah, it's a funny point you raised, John.  Not to get away from the topic, you know.  No, you're not wrong.  You could use some dumb deodorant. 
[00:11:00]  You had the wrong guest.  It doesn't irritate.  Yes, especially with the things I was doing.  It's not irritation.  So when things get a little...  I would have rubbed up deodorant in my mouth.  Actually, it might have been more for your girlfriends, but this is, you know, guy deodorant.  Sorry.  Well, yes, but I did do things I shouldn't have done, but I still love them.  Because the way I looked at it is when I was drinking, I stole from my mother and my grandmother to drink.  I stole from my father to drink.  And I love them.  So it's like sometimes you cheat in a relationship, you still love the person, but just serving that other need becomes so much more. 
[00:11:30]  It almost made sense.  It almost worked.  That's the same rap he gave them before they relaxed.  Yeah, exactly.  That's a great point.  Even if they found that inappropriate text, I'm like, let me explain it again.  This goes way back.  It's me showing my love for you.  You think you've got to give it a shot.  Roll the dice.  Yeah.  I'm a bit upset because when Shaq was promoting Dove, he gave his product, John McEnroe, man.  I think there's product around for you guys.  All right.  Okay.  I want to make it all different.  They do the real woman campaign for the women, right?  Yeah.  They have those pictures of those chicks that are just regular in their underwear. 
[00:12:00]  This timing is good for me, though, because my wife recently started to say, hey, listen,  maybe you should start wearing some deodorant.  Thankfully, Dove men plus care.  I mean, you know, you have a strong scent.  And I love it, honey.  But did you know what he was wearing for years?  There was a period of years where I didn't wear it.  Yeah.  I went all natural.  What was that?  Was there a thinking behind it?  Did you not like what it did to you?  Or did you just not care about it?  A combination of it. 
[00:12:30]  Just not into it.  You know, people are getting stronger and stronger scents.  Oh, man.  It didn't seem to be working as well.  But I finally found the right anti-irritation, anti-perspirant formula.  Yeah, there it is.  I was scared.  There it is.  So it's good timing.  I use all Dove products because of Shaq.  He came in here with that stuff.  I tried it for the first time.  What was Shaq using?  The soap?  I think the deodorant and the soap he brought us in.  It was the body soap.  Yeah, there's a few things. 
[00:13:00]  I use the deodorant.  I know that.  It was great.  And the deodorant I use, yeah.  With the deodorant, I'm weird.  I like sometimes when a woman doesn't wear it.  If the chemistry...  No, but I do.  John's laughing, of course.  But if the chemistry is right, I love that.  I told girls, I'll fucking throw you deodorant out and bring it over my house.  Wow.  If it's not right, that's brutal.  Yeah, but you don't want to be with a person like that anyway that's got that foul, awful  scent that you...  That's nature just telling you, like, don't reproduce.  When they're barking.  You're talking about a blubber below the marking.  It's like a moldy bulb.  Yeah.  Just somebody being, you know, clean. 
[00:13:30]  Everybody knows.  And you know when you stink.  They want clean.  Take a shower.  I don't mind.  I like clean.  I like clean, but a little natural is kind of sexy, too.  We used to have guys in the tennis circuit back in the day.  I mean, things are tough in a lot of places.  But in these countries where I guess they didn't have access to running or hot water  that often, they'd play a three-hour match.  They'd come into the locker room, take their clothes off.  They'd get a little deodorant, spray it on, and no shower. 
[00:14:00]  Oh.  Wow.  Wow, that must have been bad.  I mean, it was...  It's like, wait a second.  Yeah.  Hey, we got some hot water.  You can take a warm bath.  That's horrible.  And the smell after like three, four days of the shirt.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That musky, awful...  People get that sometimes when they leave their clothes in the washing machine too long  before drying them.  That mildew smell.  It's fucking terrible.  Do you still play tennis?  I still play.  I'm a gym.  No, I actually still play quite a bit.  I play on sort of an old fogey, seniors. 
[00:14:30]  I try to be the Rolling Stones of the tennis court.  That's got to be annoying.  I mean, they're doing pretty well, right?  So, you look at the acts that are still out there.  It's incredible.  So, that's sort of...  I go out with Borg, or now Agassi, like guys, Sampras.  I think guys ranging from a few years older to 10, 15 years younger.  Right.  Because there's a lot of you top athletes.  When you leave your sport, you don't even touch it anymore.  Well, tennis is one that you could actually play. 
[00:15:00]  That had to be difficult, right?  No, no.  I meant, you know, like, you'd have to find people of your caliber to play,  because you can't just play with us.  Well, I have a tennis academy up at Randall's Island, for example,  where I'm trying to find the next great American player  and try to nab some athletes that play basketball or football  and try to get them into tennis,  which is not very affordable and accessible and other things.  That's a whole other topic.  But certainly, it would be nice to bring the buzz back. 
[00:15:30]  It's sort of...  To me, I mean, it was a great time in the 70s and 80s.  Part of the problem is, obviously, there's a lot more choices on TV.  I mean, if you had told me that our ratings would be half of what golf was,  I would have laughed at you when we were playing.  And we get sometimes outrated by chess or poker.  Jesus Christ.  So you've got to go out and reach out and grab fans.  I mean, it's a great sport, but we haven't done nearly enough.  So we've sort of fallen back a bit.  And the best athletes in our country aren't necessarily playing tennis. 
[00:16:00]  Well, that excitement factor is not there.  I mean, obviously, when you were playing, it was fantastic that the unpredictability...  Now there's so much political correctness.  And if somebody even goes a little off kilter or says something weird,  there's this apology tour they've got to go on.  And so everybody, it's taken that spontaneity and fun and unpredictability out of a lot of sports.  Do you know when in baseball, the guy, I mean, you saw it. 
[00:16:30]  I don't know if you saw the game last night, but they made that brutal call in the first inning or whatever.  And then both managers come out and they're screaming.  And people love that, right?  But they don't have the mic right there.  They're probably not saying, hello, how are you?  Great job, pal.  But we don't have the power for whatever reason.  I mean, if you're on a football field during the Jet New England game,  something tells me that they're not out there when they're banging into each other saying, good hit. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, they're out there saying things that aren't printable or you don't want to hear.  No, but everyone would love to hear that.  But, well, they'd love to hear it, but it's almost in a way, it's sort of nice if you don't, but you know that it's happening.  You know it's happening, right, right.  In tennis, they heard everything we were saying magnified.  So it was like, oh, my God, John McEnough said shit.  I can't believe this.  You suck.  You know, to the umpire.  And all of a sudden, I'm a teller the hunt.  Meanwhile, you're right, every other sport, they're saying things ten times worse. 
[00:17:30]  And so we weren't protected, and so then they thought it was like, oh, the inmates are running the asylum,  me and Connors and Nastassi, so they have to, like, stop that.  Right, right.  Which I think was a huge mistake instead of sort of shifting and then handling it a different way.  It's also because tennis and things like golf are individual sports.  Like, a team sport doesn't really need the help, but I think the individual sports,  they need a couple of personalities that almost rise above the sport, which ropes people in.  And you did that for tennis. 
[00:18:00]  I think...  Tiger did it for golf.  Tiger did it for golf.  I think the Williams sisters were very, very intriguing in tennis.  It's a great story.  You don't have enough big personalities in tennis lately.  You have to encourage personality, which they discourage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're totally right.  Like, boxing.  You want to know what's wrong with boxing?  They're all guys that seemingly, they're from, like, Kazakhstan or, you know, Russian people.  You know, I mean, they're good fighters, but they're not...  But you don't have a good personal backstory or connect to them.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  But we do need, in a sport, I mean, it helps if you have a great American.  Right now, we have four of the best players, maybe the two greatest players that ever lived,  Nadal, Federer.  But it doesn't have that same sort of interest level, even though they're incredible, that if we had an American in the mix that was sort of battling these guys, I think, obviously, it helps.  So, I mean, that's why it's so important to find some.  We like knowing the personalities of people and having them be different, not just robotic sports players, but they do. 
[00:19:00]  They kind of take that and squash it.  You know, in football, you know, they don't want them spinning the ball or celebrating or anything.  It's kind of fun.  Look what they did to Terrell Owens.  I mean, whether you liked him or hate him, it was a personality, and they took it right out of him.  All those fans.  Wait a minute, they did?  I mean, I know what you're intimating, but I don't think they took it out of him.  But he probably would have been better off playing tennis because he's an individual in, like, a team game.  But he was about, you know, I think some people would say that it was about him. 
[00:19:30]  I think it was pretty safe to say that this guy was a phenomenal athlete that was a great football player, maybe borderline Hall of Fame player, but he was all about Terrell Owens.  It may be that way.  He himself was out of the game because, finally, they got numerous chances by numerous teams, and it continued to be more and more about him.  Now, that's Allen Iverson in baseball, or I mean basketball.  He did that to himself, but Terrell was a great athlete when he played the game with his team. 
[00:20:00]  So was Allen Iverson.  Allen was a great athlete, but I think he wasn't X'd out by the management.  You should have a, we'll do a poll.  Oh, who is it more about themselves?  Allen Iverson, Terrell Owens, and try to come up with a couple other names.  Chad Ochocinco.  Ochocinco.  It's individuals in a team sport.  You change your name to Ochocinco.  It's about you.  You're wanting some publicity.  And then you have to change your number.  Do you, um, your wife, she's still in music and recording? 
[00:20:30]  Well, she hasn't done much, I mean, with the six kids that we've had two together, has complicated things.  But we've been together 19 years.  She's actually, I mean, she should be doing this more to me, because she's one of the few people that I've seen at her age that still hit the notes.  Right, right.  That's the same key that she sang when she sang goodbye to you 30 years ago.  That's so important, you know?  That is important.  Always rock out in the car.  And she also looks good still, and she, I mean, so to me, she, I'd, I'd like her to get out there, but obviously it has to, well, she's done, she's done, she's written a lot of great songs. 
[00:21:00]  To me, I hear these songs that she's written, I'm like, get it out there, but obviously in this business now, it's difficult to know how to do it.  Yeah, that's true.  The way to do it, the right producer, it's so different that, and I'm just like, just do it.  I mean, it's easy for me to say.  Am I getting kicked out?  No, no, no.  Your people.  Oh, man.  Am I boring?  No, no, this was great. 
[00:21:30]  Hopefully Patty will do a record, and you guys have her on would be awesome.  Oh, you wouldn't have a second.  No, there's all these great tunes.  Yeah.  It's Dove Men Care, yeah, they're saying you have another interview.  Oh, damn it.  Dove Men Care dot com, and, you know, I really like John Mack.  John's a lot of fun.  Come back and see us, John.  Please.  What's your, uh, are you on good terms with the ex-wife, or it's always up and down with you guys?  We're on pretty good terms.  We don't talk at all.  Oh, that's good.  That is a perfect term. 
[00:22:00]  Do you throw something through the TV when, like, Paper Moon comes on?  Well, Paper Moon was a great movie.  Paper Moon was a great movie.  No, it was the reality show that probably put it over.  Yeah, her first two movies were Bad News Bears and Paper Moon.  Great movie.  So that's a hell of a start.  That is a hell of a start.  And when we met, she was 20, and I was 24.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  And so, she's about, I'm going to throw her under the bus here a little bit, but she's  about, in a few weeks, to turn the big 5-0.  Right.  And so, to me, she, I, I'm part of this, I'd like to say it was all her fault. 
[00:22:30]  We had three kids in five years, and she was 22 to 27, so when I look back now, when I have  a friend's perspective, I'm thinking that was a lot to throw on anyone's plate, particularly  when she's got, like, as insane a situation as she grew up with.  So I try to have some sympathy for what I threw her into, as well as I was throwing myself  into.  We didn't know.  It's interesting, the fact that you were, like, the bad guy that was taking America's  little sweetheart and corrupting her, or being, like, who you are. 
[00:23:00]  And then, do you feel like any kind of redemption after a while, that people actually went, wait  a minute, she was a little batshit crazy, and fucking John's a pretty good guy.  That wasn't a bad way to end it.  The Worst of the Week, Countdown.  On the O.P. Anthony Channel.  It's almost Halloween.  And Sirius XM is bringing you all the ghost chills and screams.

Highlighting all the joyous moments from this week's Opie and Anthony shows, this is the Worst of the Week Countdown. 
[00:28:00]  I am Sam Roberts, and if you have any question as to what I spend my time doing,  then you can listen to the Sam Roberts Show every Sunday here on the Opie and Anthony channel,  starting at 4 p.m. Eastern.  This week on the Sam Roberts Show, I have Kevin Connolly to talk about the Islanders documentary that he did for ESPN's 30 for 30,  and Snooki and JWoww.  Yeah, I know you may not like them, but listen to what they have to say, okay?  This Sunday, 4 p.m. Eastern, here on the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[00:28:30]  Now, we're highlighting the wonderfulness of the Opie and Anthony show still to come on this countdown.  Neil deGrasse Tyson explaining the universe.  Ron Howard in studio.  Jenna Jameson breaks down.  Jocktober and a lot more.  Right now, I want to play the return of Bobo for you.  We all know who Bobo is.  He's a disaster.  He's been an Opie and Anthony show freak for a long time,  and it's been like a couple years since he was actually on the air with us,  but he's been begging and begging to come back.  So what we did was we went out, and we got a giant rubber Tupperware, 
[00:29:00]  like a big Rubbermaid storage bin, the biggest one we could find.  We filled it up with water and bubble bath.  Then Bobo stripped naked, and he got inside the Rubbermaid tub.  Then a porn star washed him.  Not watched.  Washed.  We had bubble bath and everything.  It was really nice.  I think all the guys have pictures on their Instagram, Opie Radio.  I think it's A.  Kumia and Jim Norton.  You can look them up. 
[00:29:30]  Opie, Anthony, and Jim.  You can find them.  Here it is.  Bobo getting washed in a Rubbermaid bin for some reason on the Opie and Anthony show.  Number six.  Bobo, get your clothes off.  Like you love, he's going to give you a sponge bath.  Bobo, for the record, also.  Yeah.  This is news to him.  The bath.  Oh, he didn't know this was happening.  Bobo, are you happy about this?  Yeah, well, it's an honor. 
[00:30:00]  Take your clothes off.  You get clothes on.  It's an honor.  It's an honor.  I think you're breaking my V-card.  You're definitely breaking my V-card.  Yeah, that's your V-card for giving somebody a little bath.  And he just took a dump.  Take your clothes off.  What are you doing?  Your shoes, too.  He's trying to take his pants off before his shoes are off.  His ass probably has wiped shitness.  Oh, God.  Well, at least it'll be taken care of in the bath.  Yeah, you've got to get in there and soap it with your fingers.  Good.  Now, I hope.  We've got to let this bit breathe. 
[00:30:30]  It's cold water.  It's cold water.  Come on.  It's probably freezing cold.  All right.  Bobo, are you excited over there?  Let's mic the Bobo.  Let's mic the Bobo.  Take it off.  What are you doing?  Oh, look at the front of his.  Look at the front of his boxers.  Bobo, he's got a rod.  Come on.  Get your scuff off.  What are you going to do?  Get the tub with socks on?  He's already got a rod.  Lexi, he's got a rod.  Oh, God.  Get your pants off.  We've got to get the tub with socks on.  Lexi, you did that.  You did that.  Uh-oh.  I'm known for doing this.  Tough time. 
[00:31:00]  Stay tuned for this because it's going to be a real disaster.  Tough time.  He's had a couple of surgeries on his penis.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  At least you're going to be upkeeping with manscaping.  He's had most of it.  He's had surgeries.  Most of it removed.  He manscapes with Rogaine.  Not fortunately, I just didn't make the cut myself.  Bobo, don't just stand there.  Get in the goddamn water.  I don't want to stare at you.  Yeah.  He's completely. 
[00:31:30]  He's completely.  Yeah.  It's kind of odd.  Why is it odd?  Should we add bubbles?  Yeah, we should.  Oh, sure.  Yeah, yeah.  You need bubbles.  Bubble bath.  Yeah, you need bubbles.  And then Bobo's going to have to splash around a little to make.  Don't get the mic wet, Sal.  To make the bubbles come up.  We got a mic on Bobo.  All right.  Some bubbles.  Bobo, splash around the bubbles.  Get the bubbles going.  All right.  All right.  Splash.  Oh, whatever.  I'm ready to have some pet like ages. 
[00:32:00]  What?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is great.  Andrea Yates gave a sexier bath in this.  What is that?  Oh, yeah.  It's a big.  What is that?  It's a giant dildo on the end of a bat.  It's a dildo bat.  Yeah, that's crazy.  I thought I'd seen it all.  I have not seen one of those.  No, that's amazing.  Where is the big dildo bat?  Where did we get the dildo bat from?  From Saints Row.  Huh?  From Saints Row.  All right.  They need applause. 
[00:32:30]  Thanks, man.  Come on and frolic, would you?  Bobo now has some bubble bath poured on his shoulder.  Sam decided to pour some on his shoulder for some reason.  Well, he's making bubbles now, too.  Yeah.  I should have brought a rubber ducky.  Yeah, a rubber ducky.  Oh, there it is.  There's a little rubber ducky in the little.  That's right.  Rubber dummy.  Oh, no.  Now, what's going to happen is, are you going to bathe him?  I guess so.  Is there a big sponge? 
[00:33:00]  Oh, we got a loofah.  Oh, a big loofah.  There's a loofah.  All right.  You shouldn't have your top on when you bathe him, though, should you?  Well, no.  No, of course not.  You don't want to get your clothes wet, Lexi.  First of all, you don't want to get your clothes wet, Lexi.  We don't have replacement clothes for you, so I would take off as much clothing as you can possibly take off.  Look at the look on Bobo's face.  Yeah.  That is Dave Herman at a nursery school.  Right there.  Creepier.  It's an honor to be able to say this.  All right.  With the honor. 
[00:33:30]  Exactly.  And I'm accepting an award.  Yeah.  It's a congressional medal of dummy.  For three years in a row.  It's an honor to be humiliated.  Yes.  I like this.  Oh, Bobo, what do you think of Lexi's body?  Yeah, she looks great.  Yeah, huh?  Nice dumper.  Wow.  She's in a fishnet stocking.  Sal, get out of my photo op.  Come on, Sal.  Jeez, Sal.  Stop giving me a rod.  Move out of the way.  We've got to get a photo.  Lexi will have a photo op.  Just here we go.  Bobo photo op.  Wow.  Bobo.  Oh, my God.  I have to go.  This is like fucking, what's his name from one floor over this cuckoo's nest? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Where he's going to kill himself.  What scene was that?  We got all mad at Billy.  Oh, yeah.  Feels great.  Yeah.  Oh.  Made by a woman before?  No, never have.  Just my mother.  Yeah.  We also have some fun soaps, some soap foams.  Oh, well, we need that.  Get in there.  You can write on him.  We can write on him on his head.  Lexi, we'd hate that bra to get wet.  Is there any way that could come off?  Yeah, you really should have your heavy, beautiful bosom. 
[00:34:30]  Yes.  Pouting.  Your pouting bosoms.  Yes, your teardrop, suckable bosoms.  Bobo, what do you think?  Look at these.  What?  Here they come.  They're almost unleashed.  Oh, Bobo.  What do you think, Bobo?  Yeah.  Look at those, huh?  Nice.  Wow.  Why don't you reach out and just make sure they're real, Bobo?  They look kind of sexy on you, that tie between them.  That's great.  It reminds me of a noose.  Yes.  They look kind of sexy, that tie between them.  Oh, well, now Sam's applying some of this spray kind of colored foam stuff. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, what the hell is that?  I don't know.  Wow, he's really bubbly.  Looks like a pelican came on him.  Oh, wow.  That's really soapy.  Get some on his head.  He's got to wash his head.  Yeah.  There we go.  Bobo.  How beautiful Bobo.  Is this great, Bobo?  Do you want to take your glasses off, Bobo?  Then I can't see your wonderful titties and the tie between them. 
[00:35:30]  How come you didn't check her breasts to make sure they're real?  What are you, a peter pumper?  No, I can see.  I can see.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Why would you fucking...  Oh, look, his hair's being all clean now.  He's gazing up at her like a baby bird waiting for some regurgitated worms.  Yeah.  That's great.  Look at him.  Look at the depths there.  Yeah, from this angle, it looks like the fucking...  The last five seconds of this is a Pruder film.  She's doing a great job, though.  Look, she's getting his ears and his face and his head. 
[00:36:00]  Do you work in a mental institution, Lester?  Yes, lots of crazy people who write something.  It's like she's done this before.  I know, right?  Exactly.  Look at that.  I got to go, guys.  Enjoy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Bobo, enjoy yourself.  We'll let this bit breathe for you, Jimmy.  Yes, this bit is definitely breathing.  Hopefully by the end of it, Bobo won't be.  Right.  Oh, I'll see you next time.  See you.  Yeah.  Oh.  Was that the can or Bobo?  Why isn't Bobo moving?  Bobo, you're really not... 
[00:36:30]  It's like she's washing a statue.  Yeah, Bobo, you don't seem to be enjoying this.  We set this up just for you, sir.  Bobo, put it in the duck.  Put it in the duck a little bit.  Huh?  Bobo, stand up so she can get the rest of you.  Stand up in the tub.  She's got to get the rest of you.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  He's poking straight out.  Oh, jeez.  There's more soap.  You liking this, Bobo? 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, I'm liking this.  Bobo, you got something going on down there, I see.  Bobo, what's happening down there?  Which Sam is now hitting with some...  Trying to get some soap on it.  But he can't get...  Mr. Bubbles.  He's trying to drop Mr. Bubbles spray on Bobo's penis.  I think that's going to be a normal reaction.  But he can't get it past his gut.  Right.  Because it doesn't come out.  There it is.  There you go.  There it is.  It's covered with soapy stuff.  It's hanging from it. 
[00:37:30]  Bobo.  There you go, Bobo.  You got soap all over your schwanz.  There you go.  So we covered...  Oh, boy.  Now she's rubbing it.  Oh, Bobo.  How's that feel?  She's washing it.  Oh, that feels good.  Yeah, you like that?  Yep, I like that.  Nice and clean.  Yeah.  Here comes the pre.  Lexi, how's it for you?  Bobo, that's hot, right?  That's hot.  She's like, it's very sexy.  Yeah.  Wow, she's a good actress.  Yeah.  That's...  Bobo, you ever had a girl this close to you when you were naked before?  Never have.  No, huh? 
[00:38:00]  Never have.  How does it feel?  Feels good.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Oh, no.  Put the...  That's a little bit crazy.  No, it's a little pacifier with Somalis on it.  Put the nook.  Put the nook in your mouth.  Right.  You're a little bit cold.  He's got to put the nook in his mouth.  He's shaking.  How cold is the water?  What a photo op this is.  I need some pictures.  I've got to take some pictures now because this is so fucked up.  Got real weird real quick.  It got real weird. 
[00:38:30]  The fucking nook just made it really fucked up.  For those of you listening at home, it took Bobo about 45 seconds to walk into this room  and end up naked at Tupperware.  Bobo's got a pacifier in his mouth.  Yes.  And foam soap all over his face and head.  Sorry, we stopped talking because that's like...  Yeah, yeah.  That's ridiculous.  Sam's a consummate professional.  He'll...  By the way, for those keeping...  If you have a scorecard at home, Bobo is indeed still erect fully.  Well, we didn't need to know all the details there, sir. 
[00:39:00]  Holy...  At Lexi Lone, right?  He's also playing with his rubber ducky.  Yeah, he's loving the rubber ducky.  He's loving the tits.  Being washed.  Bobo, did any girl...  Has never gotten that close to your wiener before, right?  No.  Wow.  That felt good.  Yeah?  What do you mean?  You're just kind of like, ah, it felt good.  Oh, it felt great.  Yeah?  It felt great.  Did you feel anything like you were close to anything?  Yeah? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, it felt like she was close.  It was too much soap on his face.  Whatever.  Should we, uh...  That's great.  Should we wash his, uh...  What?  His asshole?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Bobo, how's your asshole?  Needs a good cleaning?  Is it dirty?  Yeah, Lexi, did you get the undercarriage?  Yeah, you gotta get...  I didn't get the undercarriage.  From the back.  I'm going to move her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bobo, you're going to have to bend over, so Lexi...  Bobo, stand up and then grab the front edge of the, um...  The tub with your hand.  Oh, my God.  Should we turn around? 
[00:40:00]  Uh...  You gotta put the pacifier down.  Yeah, yeah.  Turn around, Bobo.  Turn around.  There you go.  Turn around.  Now...  Now...  Oh, jeez.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, my dear Lord.  He's spreading his cheeks.  She's washing his asshole.  Like, he really is concerned about having a proper bath here.  What are you doing?  Bobo, why are you spreading your cheeks?  No, because I guess that's what I was asked to do.  Yeah?  Is that what you were asked to do, Bobo?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:40:30]  Bobo, what's your Twitter these days?  I don't even know.  It's a Bobo...  Bobo...  Bobo...  Bobo XM 103 NYC.  Bobo what?  XM 83?  That's like impossible.  XM 103 NYC.  NYC.  That's like an impossible one to remember.  All right.  Yeah, that's too much.  I'm trying to tweet some of this shit.  Oh, my God.  Do you got the undercarriage?  I did.  I did.  Oh, good.  You got to get in there.  I know, but he'd have to bend over for me.  Bobo, bend over.  Bobo, she wants to get in there.  Oh, Lord. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  We need to do some manscaping, Bobo.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  I got some of that.  Wow.  That's good.  Bobo, you got some...  I think you got some shit still hanging out.  He's got really bad skin tags in his armpits.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, Bobo, can we snip some of those skin tags? 
[00:41:30]  Bobo's got, like, fucking giant moose balls.  Oh, he's got soap in his eye?  Bobo, you all right?  I'm all right.  He's like, I'm all right.  Please don't stop.  You don't want to stop, do you?  No, it's nice.  Yeah, huh?  Nice.  Would you like to give Lexi Love a little scrubbing?  Oh, watch your eyes.  Bo's head is being rinsed off with bottled water by Sam.  He's just squirting it in his face. 
[00:42:00]  He's sitting there with soap all in his eyes, and then I'm rinsing it off his face, and  he goes, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.  You got a lot of soap in your eyes.  Oh, Bobo.  She's taking care of you.  Look at this.  How nice this is.  Yeah.  What a sweet moment.  He's in a big plastic.  He's in a giant plastic.  Like a Rubbermaid storage bin.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, I can see this one.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  I take like five, six at a clip.  He's so happy.  He is.  Look how happy Bobo is.  Bobo, we haven't seen you happy like this in a while.  That's nice.  Well, when you got an attractive lady like this, of course.  Oh.  Dave Herman said.  I'm going to take this my new profession.  Yeah, huh?  Sam keeps washing soap into Bobo's eyes from his head.  I'm not, like, you're fucking...  I'm trying to get it off his face.  It's just sitting on his face.  But you're putting it on his soapy head, and the soap is running right into his eyes. 
[00:43:00]  He can't take care of himself.  This is so bad.  He's got a naked girl in front of him, but he can't open his eyes because they're all burning with soap.  He's like in hell.  Yeah.  Lexi Love, would you like him to kind of give you a little...  Um, you know, I think I'm good.  You're good.  I love about, like, the second-hand bath water.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's true.  I would assume.  Yeah.  All right, now what do we do?  It looks like Bobo's washed.  I know. 
[00:43:30]  Bobo's pretty washed.  All right.  How about we rinse him off?  He's got to be rinsed, right?  Not really.  That's not...  Here's some more water.  I think you've got to stand up, Bobo.  Give him another bottle.  Our participation here is done.  We don't need to rinse him off.  He can rinse himself off.  All right.  He's standing up.  I can't even...  Oh!  What?  Oh, that made Bobo mad.  Oh, the water bottle exploded, I think.  Oh, what happened?  He scored...  That water bottle. 
[00:44:00]  Wow, that exploded, Bobo.  You all right?  I'm all right.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  And then there's a towel...  Why is the towel covered in soap?  I used the towel to wipe off his face.  See, but now he's supposed to dry with that, but...  I'm just not a practical guy.  In the bin.  In the bin.  Your elbows are...  Pull your elbows into the bin.  What's the matter?  You're cold...  He goes, it's cold.  It's cold.  It's cold.  It's cold.  It's cold.  It's cold. 
[00:44:30]  Wow, this is another...  It's cold.  Another amazing day at work.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wait.  There we go.  Oh, nice.  Take some pictures, of course.  I see love.  Bravo.  Nice.  Oh, hell yeah.  Gave us some good photos.  Bobo's, China.  Good photo ops.  That's great.  Right.  His underwear is next...  Like, he reached his head out of the bin...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  ...and all the water came off of him?  Yeah.  His underwear is soaking wet.  All of his clothes now are soaked, and he left it right by the side of the tub. 
[00:45:00]  Bobo, he's just careless.  You good, Bobo?  What's the matter?  I'm good.  What's wrong?  What's the matter?  You're mad that it's over?  Well, obviously...  It's not good.  It's kind of a weird yet enjoyable moment at the same time.  Oh, yeah?  Why is it weird?  I don't know.  This kind of feels weird saying that he got me so...  I got a...  So it can't be a path on the air.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

It's the Worst of the Week Countdown, and I am Sam Roberts, hosting this whole damn thing,  bringing to you the great moments that happened on this week's Opie and Anthony Show.  For instance, Ron Howard in studio.  Neil deGrasse Tyson in studio.  Jock Tober.  Jenna Jameson breaking down.  Right now, though, we just heard Bobo's return to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:50:00]  He got washed by a porn star named Lexi Love while sitting nude in a Rubbermaid storage bin.  He stayed for the show.  Bobby Slayton, the pit bull of comedy, stopped by the Opie and Anthony Show this week,  and Bobo decided to stick around and just take over Third Mike.  Jim Norton wasn't in studio, so Bobo figured that while Opie and Anthony talked to Bobby Slayton,  it would be a good time for him to get in some of his zingers.  So here they are, Bobo and Bobby Slayton in studio on the Worst of the Week Countdown. 
[00:50:30]  Number five.  You know, gluten, it's up there now with black tar heroin, AIDS, and breast cancer.  It's killing more Americans.  But what's amazing about it, you know what gluten is?  It's flour and water.  It makes pasta.  It makes bread.  But nobody in Italy has ever died from gluten.  That country should be called glutally.  Nobody's got a problem with glutally from the goddamn gluten.  Bobby, we bring this up because we're older gentlemen.  When we were growing up, there were no allergies.  There was no gluten-free shit.  You had a kid that had asthma.  That was about it.  Right.  But they weren't dropping dead because they ate a peanut. 
[00:51:00]  A peanut.  So what the hell's going on out there now?  Let me tell you something, though.  Really quick.  Why is Bobo raising his fucking hand?  Raise your hand, Bobo.  Robo, folks.  What I was going to say is that I think it's the same thing.  Same theory like if you grow up with dogs in the house from the moment you're born, you don't have the dog allergies.  So I think you've got to start having them eat the stuff while they're young.  I know I recognize you.  You're the lettuce guy at Subway, aren't you?  He's the lettuce guy.  I ain't the lettuce guy. 
[00:51:30]  By the way, you almost got bumped today for him.  I know.  This won't be the first time, pal.  Holy shit.  But here's what's interesting.  My wife, you said the peanut allergy.  I was on a plane a few months ago, and there weren't certain peanuts.  This kid had a peanut allergy.  And it was so bad.  I guess if you open up the peanuts and the fumes of dust.  The dust.  But my wife, when I married her, told me just 25 years ago, said she had a peanut allergy.  We never heard about this.  She goes, there can be no peanuts in the house.  Years later, she said penis allergy.  They can be no peanuts in the house. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, now it all makes sense.  It's amazing how big a difference to us from a little misunderstanding.  Like that, it makes sense.  Just so you know what's going on.  We went old school today.  We don't do these type of bits as much.  But we had Lexi Love, naked, giving Bobo a sponge bath.  A sponge bath.  And we have cupcakes.  Now we have cupcakes.  Well, now we want to shove one up Bobo's butt.  Oh, Jesus.  That would be the grand finale of the week, Bobo.  Would you allow us to do that?  I want one. 
[00:52:30]  But do one of the white ones, not the chocolate ones.  I saved those for opium.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, one of those marshmallows.  Wow, that's really a lot of cream on those.  They look amazing.  Oh, man.  Lexi have one.  I can't.  Well, you can have the icing.  That is probably.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  I got my dick washed by this lovely lady.  I wish more people would say that about me.  Yes.  I'd be happy to say that.  Yes.  Bobby doesn't miss a trip.  I'd be happy to say that.  You know, this is really funny. 
[00:53:00]  It was 15 years ago.  It was in 1998.  It was the last time I did your show when you were on regular radio.  It was also 15 years ago this month.  Wow.  And I think it was 15 years ago this month was the last time my wife blew me.  So it's kind of a trifecta I did today.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You ever get your dick washed by a chick like this?  Oh.  Well, not today.  I could do that myself.  You know, I have bigger fantasies than have my dick washed.  I could do that after I have the hooker.  See, I shoot for the stars. 
[00:53:30]  Right, Bobo.  You know, getting your dick washed.  To you, it's a big thing.  Right.  Tell us it's called a shower.  Yeah.  Tell us it was a sideshow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But to Bobo, it was everything.  Yeah.  I'm glad you were happy about him.  Bobo's good.  But Bobo got his dick washed.  Yeah, yeah.  It's very important.  You need to get me a whore.  Yeah?  Okay, what?  What happened?  No, I need to get me a whore.  Get me a whore.  No, no, really?  He's a virgin.  He's never had sex with a girl or anything.  And he's given us one of the greatest moments ever on the show. 
[00:54:00]  He gets hard instantly.  But then you start talking about the Mets and it goes down instantly.  Oh, really?  It's the most bizarre thing ever.  Let me give you one piece of advice.  If you do get a hooker, because here's where they rip you off in New York, they'll charge  you more for the gluten-free pussy.  Don't go for it.  Don't go for it.  Get the regular pussy.  Don't go for that gluten-free.  It's kind of good, though.  Sometimes you don't want swollen, nasty, rashy pussy.  So I think both of us are right.  I got big balls, so I'll be fine.  Yeah, we understand both of them.  That's fantastic.  Unfortunately, we saw them today.  I want one of those cupcakes.  Oh, jeez. 
[00:54:30]  I want those balls.  I want those balls.  No, I have to wait until after the show, though.  I have to do it.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to do it.  The audience gets a little mad when you're eating on the air.  And we haven't seen you in 15 years.  If you're holding a grudge, they could be poisoned.  No, no, no, there's never any grudge.  You're going to see how this goes, and then you have to take them back.  That your daughter's taken off, too.  We had a whole conversation about you the other day.  You know, he said to me.  Do you talk about it?  Well, I called him up, and I said, look, I want to get back on the Urban Anthony Show.  He goes, let me put a call to the guys and tell them.  See, you know, my daughter, Natasha, who got into showbiz when she was nine. 
[00:55:00]  As a matter of fact, when she got into showbiz, I had a big fight on the air with a big-nosed  Jew down the hall.  And I haven't been back on the show in a long time.  I don't want to mention any names.  You can figure it out.  But the overpaid big-nosed Jew.  We all know he's an asshole.  Trust me.  Well, that should get me back on here next time.  Okay, I'm done with that.  Now, I've accomplished my thing.  There's no surprise there.  But you know what?  My daughter got into showbiz when she was nine years old.  And I didn't want to do it to her.  I did a great story.  She's now a pussycat, though.  Where, um, and, oh, now I see. 
[00:55:30]  I don't start getting excited.  Bobo, relax.  Bobo, just focus on Lexi.  Okay, so now she's a pussycat doll.  And now she's a pussycat doll.  But they're reinventing that band, I think.  Yeah, I never hear from her again.  Well, that's fantastic.  Goodbye.  I don't think they're called a pussycat doll anymore.  They're called Girl.  They're called GRL.  And they got Britney Spears' manager, which I could use right now.  All the help I could get.  But they're, and they still, you know, fight crime and dress like hookers.  They haven't changed.  They're no different than the pussycat dolls.  They reinvented them, but it's the same people.  They sing, and they dress like hookers, which is fine. 
[00:56:00]  Right, Lexi?  You bet.  Of course.  That's great.  Yeah.  That is pretty goddamn cool.  So you've got to be a proud pompa.  Bobo with DTF.  Oh, boy.  What?  What?  What's that?  Bobo with DTF.  Well, you don't have to talk about Bobo in third person.  You can, we know.  What's DTF?  What's that?  I've never heard of that.  I'm not sure what it means.  Just heard it before.  Okay.  He doesn't know what it means.  He heard it before.  You don't know what that means?  Yeah.  You just know it was the thing to say in the middle of nowhere?  God, I thought I'd bring the show to a standstill.  Thank you, Bobo.  Oh, my God. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you.  Bobo, you really are like putting the brakes on the show today.  I was just trying to get my dick wet.  Now you're trying to get it wet?  His dick wet.  It just was wet.  You were in the bath.  She watched you.  It was great.  That's your daughter?  He's too, uh...  That's my little girl.  My little girl.  Which one?  The one that tries to like, oh, he sinks.  But they fight crime.  I think my daughter's the one that turns...  I'm not sure if she turns invisible or turns herself into fire.  You know, they all have different powers.  They don't really talk to me about their secret.  It's supposed to be under the radar. 
[00:57:00]  I probably shouldn't have mentioned that.  You got any Wi-Fi cams in that office of yours where you can...  You know, here's what's really kind of creepy.  A friend of mine calls me up.  He produces a show on Nickelodeon.  He calls me up.  He says, Bobby, my daughter, eight years old, is a big fan of this band Girl.  So he calls me up with my eight-year-old daughter, really wants to get tickets.  I said, I got something better.  I'm off for two weeks.  Why don't you have...  I'll have all the girls come over.  I'll see if I can wrangle them over.  They're about to go on tour.  They all come over.  We have a little swim party.  And they're all very pretty. 
[00:57:30]  But again, they're friends of my daughter's.  I have something to say.  I guess you realize stuff still works.  You don't have a dysfunction when you realize those girls walk in.  Well, first of all, let me tell you something.  I'm 58 years old, okay?  I have no problem.  I'm not even sure what he said.  I don't know either.  I don't know why we're torturing like this.  It's been 15 years, and then you've got to do this.  But it's okay.  I deserve it.  He knows where to pipe in, though.  That's what I like about Bobo.  Yeah, he's perfectly timed. 
[00:58:00]  Right at the end of the story, you had the great punchline there, and then he popped in.  It was coming up.  So wife is out of town.  They're in their bikinis.  Oh, man.  But they're your daughter's friends.  Which makes it creepy.  But they're my daughter's friends.  It's the same thing when my daughter was 17 or 18.  You look at some of her friends, and women like to remind you, she's your daughter's age.  But I don't think about my daughter when I look at young pussy, and I try to explain that to my wife.  I look at old pussy.  I don't think about you.  I drive by the Statue of Liberty. 
[00:58:30]  Hey, I'd better call home.  You know, it's not.  My daughter has nothing to do with my fantasy of pussy.  I need my dick washed right now with a cupcake in my ass.  Dick washed in a cupcake.  Pussy is pussy, am I right?  What?  But pussy is pussy, am I right?  No.  No, it's not.  You're a virgin.  You want to know.  No.  And it's not.  No.  There's, you know.  To you, yes.  Yeah, yeah.  To you, it's like you're on Gilligan's Island.  A coconut, a lobster, whatever you can find to eat.  A palm frunk.  In your situation, pussy is pussy.  Paid for, imaginary, in your little world. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  This is the day to have his wife's pussy.  Just be happy with whatever you can get.  And then you can work up to our level.  Right.  Where we actually have or have had good pussy.  Don't try to be us.  Different types.  You know, you're like a young rock star that watches Keith Richards and go, I'm going to  shoot heroin.  And then do a, no, you can't.  And then he's dead.  Yeah.  And then you're dead.  You've got to know how to prolong that career.  A little something else.  Yeah.  You just barely got your dick washed today.  Right.  Well, at least my dick is clean.  There you go.  It wasn't before.  There's an upside to it.  Yeah.  Unless you love, you like that too, right? 
[00:59:30]  It was rather arousing and interesting.  I mean, I've never done that before.  In the realm of all the penis you've probably seen in your day, as far as size goes, where  do you put that and what you've seen?  One being one inch, ten being ten.  Bobby, he's got a little nub.  He's got a nub.  It's maybe this.  Poor little nub.  What do you think?  Is it literally the smallest penis you've ever seen?  It's not the smallest.  Wow. 
[01:00:00]  Wow.  It's not the smallest.  Is it Asian style?  It is Asian style.  Now you've seen a lot of Asian penises, right?  Yeah, I've seen you.  Now, is that a stereotype?  I know they can't drive.  Well, actually, Japanese men have pretty big penises.  What?  The Chinese men have small penises?  I think so.  That's how you tell them apart?  Because I always tell you to tell them apart.  Hey, look at his dick.  Because people can't tell Japanese Chinese.  Are you Chinese or Japanese?  But I guess it really is that...  I did a scene once with a Japanese man, and I was like, whoa.  I was like, that's pretty big. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  Can I show you what a pussy I am and how loyal I've been to my wife?  I hosted, before Norton did it, before, you know...  Porn Awards.  I hosted the Porn Awards for like four years.  The first comic to do it.  You know, the late, great Bill Hicks had been on it.  I think Richard Belzer had been on it.  I hosted.  What a coincidence, I jerked off to the Porn Awards.  Really?  What is that?  I'm surprised you've jacked off to the Scarecrow.  I love him.  He's jumping right in.  Jumping right in.  Both feet.  This guy's a regular Johnny Carson.  You need like a rape show.  Never mind Jimmy Fallon.  You're the next big...  He's the guy. 
[01:01:00]  I'm loving this.  I know you guys didn't do this to me on purpose.  No, we wouldn't do that, Bobby.  No, no, no.  Not Bobby.  If you work extra hard, no.  Of course not.  Let's make it a little bit more difficult.  There's not a lot of pressure on Bob.  Let's put a porn star, a retarded guy.  We'll make...  But it's okay.  I'm kind of hurt.  I'm getting over the roadblocks, fellas.  Of course.  You're doing great.  So, Porn Awards.  First comic.  First time I host a Porn Awards.  My wife, she goes with me.  I don't know why I took her to Vegas to the Porn Awards.  And I never heard the end of it.  Okay.  And I wasn't doing anything.  I come back the next year to host it. 
[01:01:30]  Feel free to jump at any time.  Actually, you know what, Bobo?  Wait till I get to the punchline.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be a kind of girl.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll be a kind of girl.  I'll be a kind of girl.  I'll be a kind of girl.  I'll be a kind of girl.  I'll be a kind of girl.  I'll be a kind of girl.  I'll be a kind of girl.  I'll be a kind of girl.  So, she says to me, I got a limo and backstage passes.  We catch the last few minutes of Metallica's concert.  So, we go to see Metallica.  And we go backstage.  And I think we're probably doing a little bit of blow or do whatever.  I didn't want to.  It was the time.  But, you know, when you're backstage with Porn Stars.  No.  With Porn Stars.  Oh, well, that too.  You have to.  You have to.  You don't want to feel like an idiot.  No.  Of course not.  Okay. 
[01:02:00]  So, you do a few lines.  And I'm getting worried.  Have you ever done Coke, Bobo?  I'm going to interrupt you before you interrupt me.  I'm going to get you now.  I'm going to put you on the spot.  See how it feels.  Any cocaine, Bobo?  No, I ain't never done cocaine.  Can you not afford it?  Do you know where to get it?  I don't even know where to get it.  Do you know where you get it?  It's the same people that protect the pussy.  You have to find it.  It's in the same room.  There's cocaine.  There's pussy.  You've got to find that magic room.  I've got enough contact to be sleeping in a living room of my house.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  What are you saying?  What are you saying?  What are you going on in Bobo's house? 
[01:02:30]  No, I know.  Call the authorities.  I'm suspecting there's some stuff going on next door.  Next door?  Some of the walls are getting high?  Some weed.  Well, I've slept in.  I've slept in.  I've took a nap in the living room at times, and the living room happened to be open.  Not knowing it?  I don't know.  So you're prying your neighbors.  You're like Mrs. Kravitz.  Just find your own business.  Wash your dick, Jack, but leave your neighbors alone.  Just trying to get the pussy juice.  What?  What are you trying to what? 
[01:03:00]  Trying to get pussy juice.  Pussy juice?  Yeah.  Why would you want pussy juice?  That's the juice.  Pulp or no pulp with that.  Because java juice now has a drink.  Along with anal leakage.  I'm interrupting my own story.  Coke.  Rock stars.  Now, cocaine for me.  She's been cheating all the time.  I just tweeted this shit.  Thank you, by the way.  So, what did you say?  I don't know.  What did you say?  I just said I just tweeted this shit.  To who? 
[01:03:30]  What do you have, minus 10 followers?  Who did you tweet to?  No, no, no.  I got thousands.  You do?  Yeah, I got thousands.  You probably have more followers than I do.  And as much fun as I'm having with these guys, all I'm going to get is, who's that fast-talking Jew?  Oh, God.  No, no.  I'm going to hear the story.  No, look at the haste.  The last time I was on Ron and Fez, and I said something about Patrice O'Neal, who's a friend of mine.  And I got more shit, because Ron, who likes to make more trouble.  And Fez, who likes to have more nervous breakdowns.  Who made me look like such an asshole. 
[01:04:00]  I'd never be back on the Opie and Anthony network.  But I didn't know I brought that up, because I like Patrice.  But he pulled a number on me once, and it was funny, actually.  But anyway, so, but my wife never figured.  What?  Fez is my nigger.  Don't talk shit about Fez.  I can see why you'd like Fez.  If anybody could take his place.  If anybody, if Fez, they actually, if they ever put him away permanently, I could see.  You know, it's almost like Darren on Bewick.  There are 30 guys that could take that place.  Yeah, good job.  But, man.  Wait, what's your Twitter?  I'm trying to find it.  Pitbull of comedy. 
[01:04:30]  You know, this Pitbull thing.  That's another stupid story.  I should really change that.  But I've had that nickname, the Pitbull of comedy, since the 80s.  But it's like, get rid of a mullet.  You know what I'm saying?  What do you think?  Do you honestly think I want to be Opie at this age?  I got the name at 12.  So I get it.  Now I don't feel so bad.  No, I get it.  But we can't change the branding at this point.  I hate the fucking name.  Rod Howard must have brought it up, how much he hates.  Yeah, we talked about how much he hates people to, when they bring up Opie.  Yeah, yeah, but, you know.  It's something to be proud of.  I'm stuck with the nickname Bobo for life. 
[01:05:00]  Well, you deserve Bobo.  That is a perfect name for you.  Run, Bobo, run.  Run, Forrest.  You should be Bobo.  I'm following you.  And I'll follow you guys.  I'm following you right now.  See, we're back together.  Thank you.  Back together.  All right.  You got time to say something?  I don't even know what happened.  I have nowhere to go, fellas.  I'm working tonight at nine.  I'd love to hear what happened with the journey.  So, in the Bay Area, they used to have something called the Bammies, the Bay Area Music Awards,  which was like the Grammys, but it was all Bay Area musicians.  And it was big.  And it got bigger and bigger over the years.  But in the Bay Area, there's only so many people you can give awards to. 
[01:05:30]  For best guitar player, it's going to be Santana or maybe Neil Schoen.  For the best band, it's going to be the Airplane, the Dead, or the Doobie Brothers.  Get sold after a while.  You know, I mean, from the 70s to the 60s.  The cleanest dick goes to Bobo.  Oh, Bobo, you're still here.  Wait, what did you say, Bobo?  Cleanest dick goes to Bobo.  The cleanest dick goes to Bobo.  That's pretty clever, though.  I never thought anybody...  You've got to admit, that one was clever.  That was great.  It was a good tie-in to your story.  Well, yes.  You don't want to give him too much credit or encourage him too much.  But you know what, though?  Now he's hoping for you, Lewis. 
[01:06:00]  Now he's hoping for any money.  The Rolling Stones in 1981, I think, they were doing a tour.  George Thorogood and the Destroyers are opening up for the Stones.  And I love the Stones.  And I love George Thorogood.  So, you know, you hear these stories about the Stones every tour,  maybe doing a club date to get all warmed up for the big appearance.  Okay.  So I'm thinking they're going to play this small 300-seat club for Bill Graham.  You know, it's Mick Jagger's birthday.  The Stones are up.  They're in San Francisco.  I've got to go see the Stones.  I get a call from Bill.  Bobo, you better come down to the club.  We need you to do something.  You know what you want to talk to me about on the phone?  Wow. 
[01:06:30]  What do you need me to do?  He goes, we need you to open up for the Stones.  And I'm going, I'm going to die.  This is going to be death.  Who's opening for the Stones?  But this is what's really frightening.  The stage didn't have a curtain.  It was just the band and, you know, the road he's going up there.  He said, well, not only do you have to open up for the Stones, but George Thorogood's going to open the show.  Now, not only can a comic not open the Stones, you can't follow George Thorogood.  So you were in between Thorogood and the Stones.  And if Patrice and Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor came back to life into one person.  Oh, what?  What's that, Bobo?  Anyone notice how nice licks his ass looks today? 
[01:07:00]  Oh, Pete, you owe me another return visit after this.  I just want to make this even better for the listeners.  This is something we probably would do, but we're not doing this.  No one's passing him notes or anything.  This is unbelievable.  But if you did do it...  Bobo, you're killing today.  Anyway, go ahead.  But if you did do it, it's okay.  Right.  If anybody can handle this...  It makes it way better that we're not doing this.  He is just sitting here, yeah.  I'm laughing.  All right, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  So George Thorogood, you can't follow George Thorogood now.  You've got to go on before the Stones.  So they tell me you're going to follow George Thorogood, which is impossible enough.  But when Thorogood finishes, the roadies are going to go up on stage.  And keep in mind, there's no curtain.  So while they're changing out the equipment for a small stage,  while they're taking off the equipment and bringing on the Stones' equipment,  you have to go on.  There's a short list of rock stars that would freak me the fuck out.  And one is Mick Jagger, and Weez took them backstage in Syracuse.  Right.  And Mick Jagger came up to talk to John Sher.  And me and Weez were there.  I felt like I wasn't even worthy to say hi. 
[01:08:00]  I was out of my mind.  I'm like, is that Mick Jagger just standing right next to us like this?  Those two guys, Mick and Keith.  And again, they're like four feet tall.  But to me, before I tell you the journey story, I'm backstage at a Stones concert.  A friend of mine worked for the band, and my daughter was 11 or 12.  So it was, you know, whatever it was, 20-something years, 10, 15 years ago.  So Mick Jagger's standing there, and the Stones are literally about to go on.  And my daughter, who just started singing, getting this singing Pussycat Doll thing,  and she was, I said, oh my God, it's Mick Jagger. 
[01:08:30]  And I would never do this.  I said, Mick, excuse me.  No way.  My daughter, Natasha.  But he's just standing there by himself with his bodyguard.  I think, hot time Johnny.  And he was standing there, and I said, my daughter, Natasha, is a singer, and she's dying to meet you.  And he could have been nicer.  Go, hello, Natasha.  Nice to meet you.  Good luck with your career.  And he walks away.  I'm like you, Ope.  I'm sitting there going, holy shit, it's Mick Jagger.  And I say to my kid, how cool was that?  She says, well, it's not like it's Britney Spears.  Oh, no.  She didn't really see it.  Yeah, that's the mindset.  How sad is that?  It wasn't quite that.  But she was like that.  And when I did the movie, Ed Wood, she's a hot mess. 
[01:09:00]  Yes, exactly.  Why do I play this song and the record keeps skipping?  I don't know exactly.  And we can turn his mic off at any time.  You know that, Bobby, right?  You can just give him a cupcake.  That's true.  You want a cupcake?  You want a cupcake, Bobo?  I'll take with his shoes.  Tell us a cupcake.  And try not to touch him all.  Pass him one cupcake.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  Bobo, don't touch it.  Pass him one cupcake, Lexi.  Lexi, don't mess up the cupcake thing. 
[01:09:30]  Just give him one.  There you go.  Now, Lexi, can you touch the cupcake without getting the gluten poison?  I mean, I don't know.  I washed his penis already today, so I think I should touch the cupcake.  Yeah.  How bad is your allergy that the cupcake's worse than Bobo's penis?  How's the cupcake, Bobo?  It tastes even better, Nat, after the fact I got in the bath.  It's from this lovely lady here.  Oh, wow.  You are just a fucking...  You got away with words there, Bobo.  I'm sorry. 
[01:10:00]  Casanova.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  I want to know what happened with Journey.  Oh, so Journey.  Okay.  Never mind the Jagger.  But Keith Richards, that was one time I was speechless.  Let me tell you that.  When my first CD came out, I dedicated to Keith Richards.  He's called Rage and Bullying, 1997.  Backstage at a Stones concert.  Keith is there with Ronnie Wood.  They're playing like Snooker or whatever that pool-like game is.  And his manager comes up, because you want to meet Keith.  And I said, yeah.  And Keith Richards comes up, and I said, I'm Bobby Slade.  I'm a comedian.  I dedicated my CD to you.  And Keith goes, why would you do that? 
[01:10:30]  And I was like, no.  I'm a hammer, a hammer, a hammer.  Hey, hey, hey, no.  I'm speechless.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  Dom?  What?  We thought if we gave him a cupcake, that would shut him up.  He ate that fucking thing in two seconds.  Jesus, Bobo.  I thought you were going to the gym.  What was a good cupcake?  I hope so.  It cost four bucks.  What were you going to say?  Tasted like pussy.  All right.  Journey.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I've got to go home.  I'm okay.  I'd like you to go home.  I don't think there's a great punchline to this story.  It's like you hear it.  But what was the problem with Journey? 
[01:11:00]  Here was the problem.  So I'm hosting this show.  There's 10,000 people out there.  Bay Area Music Awards.  And everybody was there to see the Doobie Brothers.  Brothers were reuniting.  I think the airplane or Starship at the time.  Yeah, Starship.  Yeah.  I think they were playing.  And Journey was there.  And they were winning all these awards.  Because like I said, Carla Santana would be the best guitar player.  And Journey's up front.  There's a lesbian record company at the time.  They had women's music.  Whatever the hell that is.  Called Olivia Records.  And I did some joke about women's music, about the records having no holes.  I don't know what it was.  But there were 10 angry lesbians.  Like there's any other kind. 
[01:11:30]  So they're giving me shit.  And they start hissing.  Right away, things aren't good.  So I'm on stage.  And I said something.  And I meant this in the nicest way about Journey.  Now you've got to remember 10,000 music fans.  A couple of music industry people.  And all the rock and roll stars that we have in the Bay Area.  So I said something about Journey.  And the joke was, you know, this is Journey.  With all due respect.  Do they have to win best black blues artists?  Because, you know, I'm saying they're winning every award.  So it wasn't really making fun of them.  Why are they winning best blues?  Right, yeah.  So Journey, they're so stupid.  Neil Shone and Steve Perry. 
[01:12:00]  And they're drunk.  They start throwing champagne corks at me.  Now being a comic.  And I'm trying to handle this whole audience.  Don't start fucking with me, you know.  Yeah, don't stop believing me.  Oh, yeah, go, go, go, go.  Yeah, that's what the whole audience is full of bobos.  Those are Journey fans.  Don't stop believing.  Don't stop believing.  9,000 of those assholes in the audience.  Don't stop believing.  That song got ruined for me after a Sopranos episode.  Right, well, you know, that's the first smart thing he said.  That song got ruined after that last episode.  I was expecting the show to go out with a bang. 
[01:12:30]  And you just go out with a blank screen.  I still haven't gotten over it to this day.  That song's been ruined since that episode.  It was bad before then.  It was bad before then.  She was talking about it like it was yesterday.  Good.  I was having a really bad week.  And you know what?  I feel like it could be worse.  There you go.  That's why we keep my round.  My daughter is a pussycat dog.  She feels like a hooker.  She fights crime.  But I could be coming home to my son every day.  Hey, Dad, can somebody wash my dick?  My life could be a lot worse.  See, Bobo wants another donut. 
[01:13:00]  But no, you've had enough, Bobo.  Yeah.  Nice fucking...  I'm doing society a favor.  They don't need you with a sugar buzz on the fucking subway.  Or the bus or whatever the fuck you take.  Thanks, guys.  Great to see you.  Great to have you back on the show.  I'm going to be back in town in January.  More than before we book it.  Yeah, yeah.  No, we'll have you back.  Fuck yeah, man.  A day where Jimmy's here, too?  Because I'm sure you guys can knock around some fun seller stories or some shit.  We'll see in this bitch.  Yeah.  All right.  Of course, Bobo, thank you for coming in. 
[01:13:30]  Thanks for the...  I'd like to say thanks to Lexi.  Uh-huh.  To that fine ass.  You can relax.  You didn't win anything.  You're not accepting awards today, Bobo.  You had a bath.  Okay.  I'm speaking of behalf of Bobo and Anthony.  You have a cupcake and a bath.  Don't push it.  Right.  Am I right, fellas?  He's having a better day than me.  Yeah, he's having a pretty good day, though.  He's having a cupcake and a bath.  That'd be a great day.  You know what?  I'm taking a bath.  I think that's all us guys want.  Great day.  Fourth floor of the O.E. and Anthony Awards to the Week Countdown.  You need X.

[01:18:30]  The worst of the week countdown continues.  Yes, indeed.  We're still counting down the worst, meaning best moments of this week's Opie and Anthony show.  My name is Sam Roberts.  Still to come on this here countdown is Neil deGrasse Tyson in studio and Ron Howard in studio and Jenna Jameson's breakdown.  But it's Jocktober.  Every October, Opie and Anthony name the month, Jocktober.  And what we do is we take jocks from around the country and make fun of them.  I listen to different radio stations from across this great land of ours. 
[01:19:00]  I record shows.  I find clips of the hosts being very bad at their jobs.  I bring them to the Opie and Anthony show.  We make fun of them.  This week, we looked at Prepburger, which is a service that provides horrible bits that morning shows across the country can pay for and pretend that they did.  It is really cheap and just dishonest and not funny.  So we played some of those as well as some bits that I found from various shows across this great continent. 
[01:19:30]  Not country, but continent of ours.  Here it is from this week, Jocktober, Prepburger.  So the first one is definitely Prepburger.  And of course, not only do they give you the material, they also give you the setup.  So you, as the radio host, don't have to do fucking nothing.  I like it.  Just have to be a good reader.  Yeah.  Set that shit up.  President Obama made a speech in the Rose Garden yesterday, Anthony, about the sorrystateofthehealthcare.gov website. 
[01:20:00]  Everyone's talking about it.  Oh, yeah, Opie, they sure are.  I had a little there, too.  I did, yeah.  We both had a little.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We went off script a little bit.  There's no reason for that.  We went off script just a little bit.  They shouldn't have lived, though.  The Prepburger knows what they're doing.  Just to pump it up a little bit.  It's like, you know, would you take a teaspoon of sugar and put it in your Coke?  No, you don't mess with the formula.  No.  He made a few more comments at the press conference this morning.  And guess what? 
[01:20:30]  We have them.  We do.  We have the audio.  Look, I know the Obamacare website is a train wreck.  I mean, I'm beginning to think whoever designed it had to be a Republican.  But I have the best of the best working on the website to get it fixed.  That includes Microsoft's Bill Gates.  You may recall Microsoft recently put out Windows 8.  And you know how well that went.  I've also recruited Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.  Mainly so you can play Bubble Witch Saga while you're waiting for the website to download.  And waiting, and waiting. 
[01:21:00]  But we'll get that website up and running faster than you can say crash and burn.  No more questions.  When is Obama going to speak?  It's funny.  No, that was the Obama audio.  Oh, I thought it was the guy before Obama or something.  No, that was the...  The Rock Obama?  Yeah, did that not sound like it?  I thought it was someone else.  No.  Maybe the worst Obama impression ever recorded.  Just because you could do maybe one or two words as Obama doesn't mean you could do an Obama impression. 
[01:21:30]  Everything has to go up.  Right.  And you sound like Obama.  That's all the guy's doing.  That's all he's doing.  Imagine being a radio show that relies on PrepBurger for bits.  Yeah.  And then you download that in the morning going, oh no, this is all I have.  That's all we have.  But a boy could dream.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would love to do some PrepBurger.  Oh, would that be nice?  Not having to even worry about anything?  How great would that be?  Oh, man.  You go in and download.  You got your setups.  You go to the hits.  Not have to fucking... 
[01:22:00]  Not have to burn my throat out going, ah!  Look, ice cream is on my nose!  He's doing a good time.  Oh, he loved it.  With his daughter.  But I'm also a killer.  Look, I killed you!  We didn't even know we were going to do the Arnold or the Billy Crystal of Duty song.  Who knows?  So, face to the rest of radio.  For...  Oh, you know, there's been rumors, Ant, that Gwyneth Paltrow...  Paltrow, that Gwyneth Paltrow... 
[01:22:30]  Gwyneth Pacho?  Cheated on her husband.  You know, the Coldplay dude.  The Coldplay guy?  Yeah, I just called him the Coldplay dude.  Damn.  They say Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.  Chris Martin.  Right?  Well, you know, we caught up with Gwyneth and Chris to talk about it.  Oh!  Yeah, we did.  Hey, Gwyneth.  Gwyneth Paltrow.  Hey, Chris.  Chris Martin from Coldplay.  I've been hearing a rumor that Gwyneth had an affair.  Is that true?  Yes, it's true.  Chris is aware of it, and it was all a big misunderstanding. 
[01:23:00]  I thought he was Chris.  Whoa!  Who did you cheat on him with?  It was a chicken.  Huh?  But it was an easy mistake to make.  Have you ever heard my husband sing?  Go ahead, Chris.  Sing something.  Very well.  Look out my sky.  Look out my shade for you.  What matters for me?  See what I mean?  Why is that singing chicken shaped like a human?  Holy fuck.  Wow.  This is not fun. 
[01:23:30]  If Jim was here.  This is going great.  I have to stand in for Jim.  Yeah.  Fucking hilarious.  Well, it's realistic.  I don't understand the concept there.  Wow.  What was that?  Chris Martin sounds like a chicken, I guess.  That's right.  But no one has ever thought that.  No, no one's ever.  There's not one person that has ever thought that.  Chris Martin is.  They're commies based on nonsense.  He's actually told that he's a very good singer.  He's an amazing singer.  Whether you like Coldplay or not, the guy knows how to fucking sing. 
[01:24:00]  They apparently thought he sounded like a chicken.  And who would go up to him and say,  Hey, excuse me, Chris Martin from Coldplay.  Somebody that wanted to get his attention.  Get to the bottom of the chicken thing.  Like a TMZ guy or something.  Get to the bottom of the chicken thing.  Yes, the chicken thing.  Hot on everybody's mind.  Wow, this is bad.  Really bad.  Hey, if you want 24 to 48 hours of attention like the St. Louis Rams has had,  just mention that you might be trying to hire Tim Tebow and voila. 
[01:24:30]  You didn't play the...  What did I do next?  What?  You're supposed to read that as if it was you saying it.  And then what happens?  Then you play the bit.  What bit?  There's a bit along with it?  Yeah, there's a bit along with it.  I thought Obie was just talking.  It was very natural.  Oh, thanks.  Thanks, Ed.  I appreciate it.  It's just a setup, though.  Tired of wasted advertising dollars on social media and conventional marketing?  What you need is Tim Tebow, the proven name to drop to make your business pop.  Just grab a headline-chasing reporter, which is all of them.  Tell them you're thinking of hiring Tim Tebow, and watch your name appear all over the news. 
[01:25:00]  Stop struggling today and christen your next promotion with Tim Tebow.  Tim Tebow, in the world of media attention, he's the cherry, on top, ready to be popped.  What did that mean?  I don't even know what that means.  I didn't get that one at all.  Is that a gay reference?  You think so?  I don't know.  Was it getting a little edgy there?  Because I tapped in.  It might have.  Was there a little edge there? 
[01:25:30]  I don't know.  I was tapping myself.  Do you understand why we hate all of radio?  Oh, God, people pay for these, by the way.  This is Prep Burger.  People pay.  They do well.  They have a lot of radio stations that are signed up for their service, and these radio  stations are playing these bits.  Yeah.  Oh, and I was looking at the calendar.  It's National Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  Whoa, massage therapy aware.  What?  National Massage Therapy Awareness Week. 
[01:26:00]  Why do you have to be aware of?  It's either National Massage Therapy Week.  It's either you ache or you don't.  Who gives a fuck?  You don't need an awareness.  Like, I'm aware of it.  But this is the bit you should do.  Right.  We're kind of doing it on the fly, but you don't, like, do it as a real thing.  You say how ridiculous it is to have National Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  Is there anyone that doesn't know that there is massage therapy?  Well, awareness is supposed to mean, like, look, let's bring this problem to light.  Let's bring this cause to the forefront. 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  Look, most people don't know this even exists.  Let's educate people.  Well, you can't go a block in New York City without seeing the word massage.  Yes.  Some people don't know.  They just walk around with very tense shoulders.  Yes.  They don't know what to do.  And there's a cure for that.  Thus, then, National Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  And guess what?  They have a spokesman.  Oh, do they?  Yep.  Do we have audio of him?  Nope.  Oh, okay.  Nope.  None at all.  All right. 
[01:27:00]  Well, that kind of brings it to a screeching halt, doesn't it?  That petered out.  Wow.  I sure wish we had audio.  That would be nice.  It was a good setup.  It's too bad.  All right.  What?  This week is massage therapy.  Come on.  Come on.  Hold on.  Just an excuse to use their mediocre John Travolta impression.  I swear I thought that was Bill Clinton.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I thought he was doing a Bill Clinton. 
[01:27:30]  Well, I knew the answer.  I should have went into this one cold.  It's a mediocre John Travolta.  This is what happens at this.  That's John Travolta?  This is what happens at the Prep Burger factory.  Yeah.  There's a guy.  What voices do you do?  A guy goes, hey, do John Travolta.  And he does it.  And it's like average, mediocre at best.  So then they have to shoehorn it into some weird thing.  Yeah, yeah.  So then they look at the calendar and there's actually, there's, I doubt there's even a  National Massage Therapy Awareness Week, but they're like, oh shit, you do John Travolta. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  And it's this National Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  You happy?  You happy now, Annette?  Now you're a cunt.  I'm John Travolta.  Guy in California, David, says local radio station has played two of these bits just yesterday.  Oh, God.  Why is this fucking, why the fuck are you listening to them, Dave?  Don't mess with my hair.  I take a long time to wear it on my hair.  And you mess with it, you touch my hair. 
[01:28:30]  Why do you listen to them if they're playing these horrible Prep Burger bits?  I feel like it's the same reason why Annette follows Bette Midler on Twitter.  Just to annoy me.  Just to be annoyed.  Fair enough.  All right, let's get to John Travolta.  All right.  What?  This week is Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  Did you know that regular massage therapy is beneficial to live a healthy, active lifestyle?  It is.  Yeah.  It does wonders to relieve stress that would otherwise make you feel blue.  And as always, with every ending, don't forget the tip. 
[01:29:00]  Seriously.  Don't forget the tip.  We get it.  Tip of your tip.  You do great work.  You know that?  I might have to put you on my staff.  Just like last time.  Okay, Senor Travolta.  I hope I can hold the way.  Massage Therapy Awareness Week.  It's explosive.  What?  Oh, my God.  I know.  See?  I need a towel.  Oh.  Say what a few more times so they know you're doing Travolta.  Right, right.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  John Travolta Clinton.  Right.  Get down from there.  And there are dozens of radio stations across the country.  They just play them every morning.  You didn't call me, Mr. President.  You didn't call me.  Oh, come down from there.  Yes.  Oh, man.  I was just thinking.  They are so bad.  I like where you're going, O.  Yeah.  Was this morning's drive a bummer? 
[01:30:00]  Uh, yeah.  Yeah, I gotta say.  You know.  Traffic.  Yep.  Ah.  Ahem.  Now what?  I gotta convey my story about the Midtown Tunnel?  Do I do that?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No?  What do we do?  Oh.  You play the bit.  What bit?  We just had a little thing there.  I asked him how the morning thing was.  I was like, the Midtown Tunnel guy stopped me again today.  Not everything has to be an over-the-top 20-minute bit.  I was just asking him a question.  He said, yeah, it was a bummer today.  All right, now what?  Looked at my Reggie and said, have a good day, all snotty. 
[01:30:30]  And I said, oh, thank you, sir, all snotty, and went on my way.  There you go.  We did it.  Is that it?  No, we have some audio.  But Opie was setting me up.  Why does everything have to have audio?  Why can't we just talk?  Do they have microphones in their studios to talk into?  Why can't they just go, hey, how was your ride in today?  And then they have a little discussion about it.  And then people out there go, oh, I can relate to that.  Oh, you know, I take that road, too.  There's too much.  And you know, I was in that same backup team.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[01:31:00]  I love going to work with these guys.  They're just like me.  They're relatable.  Right.  Maybe I'll see them on the road.  Right.  Let me look around.  He's out here at the same time I am.  Yeah.  He stops at the same Dunkin' Doris I do.  He was just talking about it.  Why can't they just do that?  Because sometimes you also, you've got to have a laugh.  And when there's this much gold out there for a radio show to use, it'd be a crime not to.  I think it's too risky, too, to just talk on the mic.  You might say something bad or offensive, or it might not be funny. 
[01:31:30]  Realize you're in no talent.  Yeah, that, too.  Do they grow flowers with these things?  How about you use the mic in front of you?  Use that mic.  They'd rather hit a button and know for sure every word that's going to come out of that speaker.  Yeah, they don't want to wear them out.  Was this morning's drive a bummer?  Oh, no.  It wasn't my fault.  Some guy in a Plymouth totally cut me off.  It was the worst commuting.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Come on, man.  Seriously.  Commuting.  I'm commuting. 
[01:32:00]  Commuting.  You know what a shoehorn is?  Because some people ask, what is shoehorning?  You take the word exactly as it's phrased in the song.  Right.  And say it that way in a conversation.  Would people look at you like you're weird because you're mispronouncing a word?  That's a shoehorn.  Oh, no.  It wasn't my fault.  Some guy in a Plymouth totally cut me off.  It was the worst commuting.  Right there at rush hour time.  Traffic backed up miles ahead. 
[01:32:30]  It was a bummer on the morning drive.  Just like every day before.  He was so mad, he even drooled a little bit.  That's like super mad. 
[01:33:00]  He is a madman.  So slow.  Now look, you'll get out of my way.  It was a bummer on the morning drive.  This has all the features.  That's why it drives me nuts.  Oh, yeah.  Get out of my way.  Go home and get your fucking shine box.  That's inhumane.  Well, it sucks.  I'm breaking your balls and you're right away, you're getting fucking fish.  They had a few clips in there that were a little, should have bleeped maybe.  That was weird, that last one, especially.  It's so bad. 
[01:33:30]  That's the wacky morning drive traffic song parody with the clips.  You know, the Simpsons clip is in there.  It just fills up space.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just there.  Who's laughing at that?  Wow.  Thank God they're playing this.  Horrible.  Well, now we move on to some bonuses.  That's it for Prep Burger today.  That's good stuff.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Oh, that's good stuff.  That's good stuff. 
[01:34:00]  We go to London, Ontario, Canada.  What?  103.1 Fresh FM.  We're not doing their show.  Fresh.  We just got a couple of their horrendous bits.  Yeah.  Horrendous.  Here's the first one.  Ryan's, my dog says, woof to you too.  All right.  Let's see what Stanley's saying today.  Late October, it's a time when the trees change color and doggy walks get much colder. 
[01:34:30]  It's the perfect time to break out my knitted doggy sweater.  Other doggy parents may laugh at me, but it keeps me warm.  I'm not as big as my other doggy companions.  Also, the lady dogs love my sweater.  They say it makes me look more sophisticated.  If you have a small doggy, get them a winter jacket or sweater.  It will make the wintertime much more comfortable and enjoyable.  My name is Stanley. 
[01:35:00]  See you at the dog park.  Come on, Stanley.  Let's go.  Oh, what a silly doggie.  I asked my dog where he put my frisbee, and all he said was roof.  It was on the roof.  On 103.1 Fresh FM.  I don't even know what that was.  I, I, I, I.  I don't know what that was.  What, what?  Holy shit.  I felt like I was listening to four different bits at one time.  Yeah.  It's woof, my dog says.  It's a doggy translator.  It's like Siri.  Right.  Like if a dog barked into Siri and then the human English. 
[01:35:30]  Well, maybe they should set it up better.  That's not going to help the bit, but maybe we should set it up better.  And you know what else, though?  Maybe they should have just called Siri for dogs or something.  Like, I don't even know what that was.  That was also a little public service announcement.  Yeah.  For dogs.  They were helping there with that one.  Telling the people, hey, you got a little dog, put a little sweater on him out there  in the winter.  A little fella's cold.  Oh.  It's interesting that you bring up public service announcements.  Oh.  Well, 103.1 Fresh FM in London, Ontario, Canada. 
[01:36:00]  A little more enthusiasm.  Oh, good.  Here's your public Ryan announcements.  I don't know.  Public Ryan announcement.  There's a guy named Ryan.  I assumed.  Yep.  We figured that much out.  You did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to do a public Ryan announcement on Idiot Parkers.  Uh-oh.  Look at this.  People who just park like total idiots.  Put on your I can relate to this hat, people.  Well, you got to be relatable to the audience. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  First thing you learn.  You want the listeners to go, that's like me.  Yes, I've done that.  Yes.  I've been there.  And now, a public Ryan announcement.  There's nothing worse than someone taking up two or more spots in a parking lot.  Oh, no.  I mean, just because you have a big truck or a really fancy car, does that give you the  right to use multiple parking spaces?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Because of that greedy person, you couldn't find a spot, and you were forced to park across 
[01:37:00]  the street and walk even further through the pouring rain.  Great.  Now I'm all wet.  Do us a favor.  If you own a larger vehicle or a super fancy car, do one of these two things.  Right.  A. You park across the street and walk the extra couple hundred feet.  Getting soaked in the pouring rain will be your punishment.  Or B. Simply leave your vehicle at home and call a cab.  Write that down.  There is no room in parking lots for space hoggers.  That was a PRA public Ryan announcement. 
[01:37:30]  It's like a battery car.  Okay.  I don't know how Scott snuck his way.  I know.  Oh, my God.  That is so bad.  First of all, if you get a...  It's not the vehicle itself.  Like, if you drive a big vehicle...  Right.  There's assholes that take up two...  Well, now we're doing the bid again.  You see?  But there's assholes that take up two spots with their small car.  So you don't even have the concept right.  No, it's not the big cars.  It's not just big fucking cars.  I've wheeled my Escalade into any parking space without... 
[01:38:00]  With nary a problem.  And this would be more of a show topic where you go back and forth.  Right.  Throw the ball around with the gills.  Exactly.  With the chicks.  And then maybe get a couple jokes in.  Maybe not.  But maybe...  You certainly would get some relatable material out there.  But...  And then you take phone calls.  Well, when I see a guy that takes up two spots, I fucking key their car.  I fucking spit on their car handle.  Sure, sure.  And you do those phone calls.  And then you, if you're not an edgy host, goes, well, that's crazy.  That's outrageous. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, man.  I would never do that.  My God.  But you don't make it into some lame ass who gives a fuck bit.  Right.  Why 98 in St. Louis?  They got a song.  Do you have a guess?  Nope.  Not a one.  Nope.  What kind of guess do we need?  It's probably What Do the Cards Say.  Oh, no!  It's a rallying song for the Cardinals.  What Do the Cards Say?  It can't be What Do the Cards Say.  No way. 
[01:39:00]  Win, win, win, win.  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer.  Fuck you.  Come on.  I gotta hear it.  Who'd you flip off?  That guy hates us.  Who is it?  I ain't saying.  We're hated.  I thought we were beloved in these hallways.  We're mostly beloved.  We were beloved.  Here's Y98 and their new rallying song for the Cardinals.  All right.  Let's hear this.  The World Series starts tonight.  What do the Cards Say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  No way.  Win, win, win, win, win, win.  These guys, they didn't do this.  They rip off each other's horrible songs. 
[01:39:30]  They did it.  They didn't do that.  Yes, they did.  it's exactly the same as the fucking shitty one that did let's have a little fun here today people  so there's no first verse come on they couldn't even write a first verse  socks go boom playoffs now now valentine fired fans hearing loud  i'm a dick play is back with gomes and napoli pitching staff with leftist case and our bats go pow pow pow

[01:46:00]  about the universe both in studio but right now jenna jameson stopped by the show and she ended up uh  coming in uh after 10 o'clock so she it was technically the after show my show but she talked to jim  norton and myself and this was a a big big moment this week because uh jim and i had no idea the  shape that jenna jameson would be in she completely broke down within five minutes of the interview if  you want to see what we saw if you need to put a visual with this bit of audio go to youtube.com 
[01:46:30]  slash not sam the jenna jameson video is up jim and i interviewing jenna if you don't want to go to  if you can't figure that out just go to youtube and search jenna jameson sam roberts jim norton  you'll find the video of the interview and i mean it's it's it's sad it's it's compelling human drama  but it's sad to watch this woman just become a shell uh here it is though jenna jameson  breaking down right in front of us on this week's worst of the week countdown 
[01:47:00]  are you doing okay in general are you all right because on twitter you seem to be a little bit  unhappy and you've been kind of you know vocal about it are you all right well it's good to be  vocal right yeah you get it off your chest that's the worst to keep it all bottled up do you think it  helps when you when you're taught when you speak for yourself on twitter which is good and it prevents  lies from being spread if you can speak for yourself yeah yeah but what was the question oh do you 
[01:47:30]  think it helps that you can uh i was asked if you were okay i mean if you're doing all right because  you seem like the things that are happening yeah i'm bummed you're bummed super bummed yeah  why are you bummed um i have uh uh bad acts yeah and it's a complicated situation too because 
[01:48:00]  everybody being such public figures everybody in the world is going to have an opinion on it right  yeah and but yeah no worries  well um all right yeah we'll definitely she wants to talk about the book of course we will talk about  it but uh let me ask you this about this um is it hard when you're talking about stuff that happens 
[01:48:30]  in real life that's unpleasant how hard is it to turn around and be sexy or to put on a sex but  seriously like like when when you have to you have to you know be erotic you have to be a certain  way sexy but i mean it's hard to get that mindset i'm sad i'm sexy yeah you do look sick and you smell  very good by the way thank you i don't want to say it's always creepy when i compliment people on their  smell yeah it's a little better when you do it to women though when the male celebrities come in 
[01:49:00]  and you're complimenting them on their smells it's even creepier yeah well you're doing signings  too which is nice yeah um good stuff are you signing today tomorrow um tomorrow at noon i think i saw  the ad in the daily news oh did you yeah isn't it amazing after all these years that uh you still get  such a huge fan reaction for your projects are are they still with you yeah i'm i'm very proud of  all my all my amazing fans and are you happy because there's probably never going to be another 
[01:49:30]  person who achieves what you did because the business is very different now than it was and  it seems like it's hard for people to become these gigantic name performers because there's so much free  stuff out there it's like i don't know how anybody it won't happen it won't happen again it won't right  no no it won't and and uh you know i feel bad but you know what i worked my butt off and i have 
[01:50:00]  turned into uh somebody that knows jenna jameson like people know me they know jenna well yeah it's a  household name we were saying before i mean there's a whole generation of people that  the only name they know associated with the adult industry is your name you know what i mean it's  something everybody knows is that are you are you happy to be associated with the adult industry 
[01:50:30]  uh or do you wish you had done more mainstream stuff uh no i'm happy yeah yeah do you think you  got out at the right time because it seems like before the mega sites all started you kind of you  got out before that happened i knew exactly when to get out and when to get back in is there any way  to make money in the business now it's because everything's for free on the internet oh there's  how's the money made money right now how's that i'm not telling you won't why not because i'm busy 
[01:51:00]  making the money you are you're still but when you went you said you got back in you're not performing  anymore or did you start are you are you producing or are you uh no no oh she's got secrets  she's got secrets but i am making good money are you yeah that's good and i mean and part of it is  also finding other projects you know what i mean to be able to outside the adult industry like the book 
[01:51:30]  sugar i mean and also i would imagine that this book has to be helped by the fact that your  autobiography was ridiculously successful it really was yeah and this is a trilogy so this is our  first there's gonna be two more are they written yet or are they uh still um the second is written  the third isn't finished but i'm telling you this one is like sex personified does it help like when 
[01:52:00]  you got like if things are going on that aren't happy necessarily does it help to have a project  that at least is coming out that you can kind of focus on that kind of helps sometimes i think  yeah i can focus yeah why was the autobiography never made into a movie uh they won't pay me  enough is that it yeah how much is enough  you want to know a number yeah i mean because there might be somebody listening who was willing  to do it because i mean it was a really like it was a best-selling book yeah and it was it was a 
[01:52:30]  compelling story and you would think that that would be a no-brainer well i mean my thing was i i really  wanted um at least five million and they weren't coming close to that uh somewhat but close is not  five million yeah right i understand yeah you got to set your boundaries and not pass them yeah 
[01:53:00]  yeah so are you going to be able do you think to kind of straighten out what the things that are  because you know i don't like to see you unhappy it's kind of you know it's not i don't like to see it  yeah um you're going to be able to straighten everything out and kind of move forward and be  all right i don't know ask him how do people react to uh you kind of being public about that  like you know you say it's good to get it off your chest but then how would you say especially on  twitter because you you have gone on twitter a couple times a few days ago you did and kind of just 
[01:53:30]  brought up your kids and custody issues and issues with your ex-husband um how have people  reacted to you being so public it's so weird how people um they talk about me saying stuff but  he's been saying stuff for months so is this kind of you finally responding cares about  what he has to say do you think are they picking on you specifically do you think i don't care 
[01:54:00]  i picking no do you think they're giving you a harder time than they're giving him  well he's a good liar  because i read a couple there's a couple it's weird how when people get mad at you or anybody  that's been in the business the first thing they hit you with who used to do porn like that just  becomes a weapon of anything whenever you're talking about children right and custody immediately  they start in with that i read i like the fact that you came back at them and you were like 
[01:54:30]  fuck you like i like that there was a harsh that's the way you should respond to that you  didn't you didn't ignore it and you didn't say anything phony polite so i think maybe maybe that's  why people are focusing a bit more on you because you kind of you know people kind of know that  they're going to get a response from you yeah true that's probably very true do you regret the  public honesty or are you happy that you're kind of no i will always be honest always 
[01:55:00]  but do you see a resolution because again if you got a good project going on  yeah i mean it's like no one can say that you're not uh having a good professional life because you  if you have a first of three books coming out i mean you know you definitely got stuff going on  oh yeah i i i have a lot of things going on but you know my main priority are my kids of course  is there anybody in your life trying to get you to shut up no everybody's happy that you're just  yeah tell the truth yeah that's good i mean the truth is is where it's at yeah yeah yeah gotta be 
[01:55:30]  truthful so i you know he'll he'll get to the point where he he feels the same way i think  i hope do you i i haven't i don't know as much about are you fighting to get them back i mean  oh you are okay how long has it been since you saw them a few months and yeah and the issue was  she was saying on twitter that he he wouldn't let her call he wouldn't let her facetime right nothing 
[01:56:00]  and so she i guess you felt like nobody realized that not only were you not getting you weren't  getting to talk to your children you weren't so you had to kind of tell the world because they  were hearing one side of the story is that it yeah yeah he's he's kind of uh told a story that  that people don't really understand and um i hope that he gets sober is that the problem do you think 
[01:56:30]  i hope he gets sober okay and um i hope he does well with his fight here soon i just want to um  make sure that i am with my kids obviously at one point you were in love at what point  does this thing become the opposite of that um there was a lot of violence so 
[01:57:00]  it's awful and do you think you'll be able to resolve it and and take care of what you need to  take care of you do yeah yeah and being honest i think again if you if you at least if you're talking  publicly it makes it harder for things to happen that nobody that nobody sees if if if you too many  people don't talk about what's going on yeah and then nobody has any idea that it's happening  that's the thing is i feel like um you know i'll get on twitter because i'll get mad and i'll be like 
[01:57:30]  wrong go crazy on twitter and people think i'm nuts but in reality it's really just me trying to  tell people what is really happening what what's what's really going on you know so it's it's kind 
[01:58:00]  of sad you know i just want to see my kids i want to be with my babies and um and work  that's my best and are you are you allowed to see them if you like say you want to go and see them  or you you are allowed to yeah what's prevented you in the last few months um actually he um  it's kind of a long story he um  so he um he had a uh judge 
[01:58:30]  make a a huge judgment against me while i was away  so i couldn't go home and i couldn't see my children 
[01:59:00]  so i've been away from my home  and i haven't seen my kids for a very very long time i'm able to see them only two days a week  and um they charge me four hundred dollars an hour 
[01:59:30]  you have to pay to see your kids yeah why do they have is it a supervised visit  and they and you have to pay for the other person to be there  which makes no sense no yeah because in a way that's saying you're unfit to be with your  because i've always taken care of my babies i mean they've always been  like with me and and again i don't know all the inner workings obviously and i'm asking you this 
[02:00:00]  just you know because we all whenever something happens there's always my part and then there's  the other person's part there's always there's always two do you do you look at it all and go  okay well you know what maybe i did this and i have to fix this before i can  is there anything that you need to fix no you feel it's it you feel it's all coming from the side  you know i really feel like there has to be a point where him and i just relax and 
[02:00:30]  and we're okay it's what he's doing isn't about us it's about  he wants to fight you know i don't want to fight  are you guys beyond because people have come back from i i guess longer breakups or whatever is 
[02:01:00]  is there any chance that you both find some kind of common ground and maybe i hope so  i don't understand how he could get that kind of custody of the kids if  based on the stuff you're saying in terms of drug use and violence and things like that you would  think if that were true that the the judge would not allow those kids to be with him wouldn't you  well what what happened was he um i was working i was out of town in vegas working and he uh 
[02:01:30]  he had some sort of um i don't even know what it's called um  is it a legal term yeah well he so the moment um i got back home he was like  you're not allowed back at the house you're done no more and what was that based on 
[02:02:00]  um the judge or what or what was said to the judge that may have even been bullshit  yeah like what was the incident that would not allow you back in your home yeah according to them  uh he said that i'm nuts just generally crazy yeah which is odd because i've taken care of my kids  from the moment they were born and they're like four now right yeah yeah so if you get it you know 
[02:02:30]  and jen is here obviously she's plugging her book uh sugar yeah and you really do smell good i've said  that before but i'll say again so i don't know how close people can get to you when you're signing  but you just try not to i always get that thing about smell yeah do you smell good yeah i've heard  that before well it's a nice quality it beats hearing the opposite i mean it beats hearing that you  smell like shit because i've been around enough people that do you kind of smell weird yeah oh 
[02:03:00]  you smell like feet and how quickly does a hot girl become not hot when she smells like shit  yeah i can handle a little armpit odor though i don't mind that as much yeah you don't have any i'm  saying i don't no no but i'm saying in general that doesn't good you don't and you're filming me  doing this yeah it's important do the fans ever get kind of creepy  oh yeah yeah ever yeah today uh i had one guy um i was here uh a couple weeks ago and he tried to 
[02:03:30]  get in my car you tried to get in your car yeah with you yeah do you have secure i'm assuming you  have a security task force with you at all times no i usually just travel with my girlfriend  and um my my friend yeah yeah girlfriend sure yeah but but yeah he was like yeah um we're gonna  we're gonna fuck i was like oh my god no how'd you get him out of the car yeah how did you i i'm mean 
[02:04:00]  i can be you're okay being mean when you need to be mean yeah so i was like take your ass  the other way well how often does that happen how often do you go to signings or even back in  the day when you were going to clubs and stuff and people think they're going to be able to go  meet you and get to fuck you i get it a lot yeah well you still dance right do you still oh you don't 
[02:04:30]  oh okay um when you so but when you would dance at one point i'm sure you had to deal with it like  guys who are fans thinking they were going to say the one special thing that was going to lure you  away or they were going to woo her yeah or they were going to be the different guy yeah there's  nothing worse though when a guy tries to pick up a girl and be the different guy like say the stuff  that you haven't heard it's fairly pathetic has there ever been a guy at a signing that's been  able to charm you or are you a couple really what'd they say you might as well give it away now yeah 
[02:05:00]  it's not gonna work the second time i don't know i was young then i was very very young there  was one boy that that i ended up hanging out with but yeah wow nowadays i'm so single and so in need  of a man you don't want to say that now there's going to be a 150 000 more creeps showing up you  just you just sold a lot more books because people are going to go and just sign it and then put their 
[02:05:30]  numbers in it and ask you to fucking so you okay you prefer being in a relationship than being single  um i just like to have sex oh well that seems like it'd be a lot more reasonable to accomplish  that's not that's not that lofty of a goal it doesn't seem like it'd be very difficult for you  to accomplish if you wanted that i'm sure you'd be able to find you're not having trouble having  sex now i am how is that possible i think i scare guys really yeah well because you're this iconic 
[02:06:00]  yeah sexual being yeah that's the beauty of me i'd tell you i'm awful going into it same for you  yeah i know you feel it you'd be fine with it you'd just say look this is going to be awful but  we're going to go oh yeah i was just first thing i'd say to her i'd be like jenna don't get your hopes  up it's not it's not going to be terrific i tell you to lower all expectations but yeah i think  that's what it is it is uh scary when you're when you're meeting somebody who's so you because you 
[02:06:30]  you're known you've you've not only are you jenna jameson but the guys you've slept with are  fucking professional fuckers i mean they're good right they think of they think that there's no way  they can like yeah the same thing we've all seen you get better than we can give  so it's like but it's intimidating i mean it's yeah but does it feel like i watched you know i was 
[02:07:00]  on one of your sets and i've watched a few films be made yeah and it seems like it's a lot of it's  done for what's visually appealing a lot of it is not done for what's necessarily going to feel good  like exactly it's like what looks good is not like like that like the bouncing really fast and hard  i could never tolerate that that does not feel good it doesn't right it does not feel good bruises  yeah so when was the last time you had sex um it's been about seven months no i can you believe i'm 
[02:07:30]  counting that's crazy seven months well it's obviously by choice so you're very picky no  okay not that picky huh no not at seven months in  uh no you know what you ought to do to break your streak i'm telling you just to get yourself out  of a slump talent what do you think you have an idea sometimes if you pick off a comedian  that's the best way to break yourself out of a slump because then your confidence is right back  through the roof do you know any or i'm just saying in general i don't know i'm not thinking 
[02:08:00]  that's the biggest laugh we got out of general it's the most absurd premise it really is i couldn't  have said anything more ridiculous oh my god have you ever been charmed in an interview and then end  up going home with them i haven't but i leave things open well it's gotta be hard too if you for you  because it's like if a guy is worth a lot of money like he never knows why someone's talking to him  you never know if you're with a guy is he like all right is he talking to you or is he is it only 
[02:08:30]  hey i love her for movies and i'm listening to nothing she says and i only care about her as this  that's exactly how i feel so how do you tell the difference um i don't i don't know it's hard  i don't know i kind of just move around if i think he's sexy i'm kind of into beards right now  they're very in style are they beards yeah yeah especially now after you just said that yeah 
[02:09:00]  exactly okay yeah yeah like a guy with beards and you're thin oh thank you i just i was just a  an unpleasant fat body  so i started working out you got so thin on me baby yeah i was just i was just really unhappy with  how i looked i see photos of us from 2000 it was january of 2004 and i'm just it's it's the worst  picture i mean you look fucking amazing and i'm just a fathead it's a humiliating photo that we have 
[02:09:30]  together jenny you've lost a lot of weight too um actually i've gained weight well you've you first  you lost a lot let me see oh booty oh i see wow whoa there is some booty it looks very nice  yeah are you more comfortable when you have a booty yeah i like i like weight i'm more comfortable  when you have a booty too yeah yeah they do yeah i like a nice hiney yeah yeah very pleasant yeah 
[02:10:00]  especially a woman who's proud of it nice round yeah yeah i was trying not to look but yeah they are  it's nice to have a there's nothing worse than somebody who has like just a flat awful  ass well i gotcha yeah do you nice and round do you work it out specifically i do what do you do i  work really hard i weights on the ass aerobics you know how to get it done would you say ass aerobic  yeah yeah yeah kind of like that good yeah good yeah so you don't have you i don't believe you're 
[02:10:30]  having trouble meeting a guy you i think that you just can't find someone you like  because you know yeah i think you know i'm still kind of figuring out what's going on  and you want to be are you are you actually divorced now or just separate i don't even know the  um divorced oh you are okay well that's the other intimidating thing is that you've been  you know people know the guys that you've been with so whether it's tito who's a professional 
[02:11:00]  fighter whether it's a rock star whether it's you know all these guys are like how does the  typical dude live up to that you know and you might be bored with the regular guy that's what  i was thinking too like not necessarily because i'd be so much happier with a regular guy but but  could you adapt to a regular guy lifestyle i went apple picking this weekend and that was the highlight  yeah i'd be cool with that you think so if a guy wanted you to make meatloaf okay come on jen 
[02:11:30]  i'll be home in a half hour i'm tired from work yeah i'm gonna make a meatloaf you'd hate that  yeah okay no yeah that would be awful right you still you know you guys got all sad really quick  no no yeah no i can do that i want i want because there's still a real life you want a real life  and you and you want to be um i mean you're away from the business pretty much i mean other than  do you still have any attachment at all like or you don't go to the events no you have no desire 
[02:12:00]  do you miss the people at all are there any of the people that you kind of miss  no it left a really bad thing for you bad taste oh no not really it's it was just time for me to leave  that's it you didn't leave with any friends in the business  that you just kind of left them um  it was just time for me to go right yeah right yeah it was time i mean you can only do it for so long 
[02:12:30]  you can't be like 20 and pounding your life away and then 40 comes around right and your life's been  pounded away right you did it so i was like all right it's time it's time it's time to get out  yeah do you still keep your is there anything are you competitive at all like do you look at at uh

[02:18:00]  neil degrasse tyson this guy understands everything there is to know about the universe uh he was blessed  with the gift to understand it and he's and he's devoted his life to researching and learning it  and figuring it out well enough that he can break it down and explain it to morons like us neil degrasse  tyson explains it all here on the countdown number two number two i got a question we throw around here 
[02:18:30]  on the show you got humans on earth and there's nothing that comes close to us and intelligence  and building stuff why is that oh that creeps me out okay because the rest of the animals on on earth  they sort of are in the same same development stage okay more or less and then all of a sudden you get  this huge jump and you get humans okay are you prepared to receive what i'm about to tell you man  fucking blow my mind are you ready first that's a great thought to have because you see 
[02:19:00]  the distance we are intellectually from all other life forms on earth our joke let's get the closest  life form the chimpanzee right but our joke is like why isn't there like a squirrel at the bus stop with  you okay i got you i got i got this you're on i got are you ready yes are you seated yeah okay all  right so so keep in mind here who does the defining of what intelligence is fair enough we define i get it  and we say look how distant we are in intelligence from other creatures let's get the closest one to 
[02:19:30]  us intellectually that would be the perhaps the chimp likely the chimp and the chimp what it can do  it it can stack boxes and reach for the banana it could do that all right i think some research has  shown they can even put up an umbrella they can do some rudimentary sign language they got some of  that they're adorable when you dress them in little engineer outfit amazing oh the hat and recognition of  themselves right is that considered a thing in a mirror yeah yeah you can get some of that so  so and that's the closest to us so we share 98 and a half 99 percent identical dna with a chimpanzee 
[02:20:00]  but look what we do we have philosophy we have poetry we have music we have the hubble telescope  right and the chimp ain't got jack all right so here's my question back to you  shit you knew this was gonna happen that's a quiz fuck maybe the difference in our intelligence  with the chimp is as small as that difference in dna 
[02:20:30]  imagine because the chimp the smartest chimps that we bring forward the primatologists bring forward  do what our toddlers can do our toddlers do what the smartest chimp does maybe the maybe that  difference in intelligence is small and how would you imagine this think of another life form we  might stumble upon that's that one half percent difference in dna beyond us that same half a 
[02:21:00]  percent difference that we are beyond the chimp what thoughts would they have they would roll  stephen hawking forward and say their humanologists would say here's one that's slightly smarter than  the rest because he can do astrophysics calculations in his head like my little timmy over here just  came back from middle school or from preschool if our toddlers do what chimps do their toddlers will do  what ours do and if you are that smart the ability to build a hubble telescope or stick us put a stick in 
[02:21:30]  a termite mound to extract termites would look the same to someone who's that much smarter than we are  when you look at fish are you contemplating how much smarter uh uh catfish is than a minnow you're not having  those thoughts for we know the catfish is brainy fish compared with in the fish world but you don't care  because you're so far beyond all of them so my big worry is that aliens observing the universe will see us 
[02:22:00]  down here on earth and conclude there is no sign of intelligent life anywhere we're all just lumped  into the same dummies that run around uh like the dung beetle and i exactly so look at the cute thing  they have these little things called cars and planes and another spaceship  that's no different from the chimp you know given what they're accomplishing you don't walk down the 
[02:22:30]  street and contemplate what a worm is thinking right but why aren't they building shit like us  maybe they have and concluded we're not interesting or possibly we are their zoo  oh yeah what do we do you get penguins you put them in you throw some ice in the water  and you paint a a a a glacier in the backdrop drop the temperature say and and how do we know that's  not what we are to them good twilight zone that one was exactly oh he knows oh yeah yeah still i think 
[02:23:00]  my favorite show of all time twilight zone it's fantastic yeah right so so i lay awake at night  not only contemplating that but wondering whether we are actually smart enough to figure out how the  universe works why would we be the measure of anything that is smart you know why because we  defined what smart is and here's the hubris of that here's an example i often give you have a book  called called um uh optical illusions who doesn't love a good optical illusion right crazy i care for 
[02:23:30]  them a lot which way is that facing wow now it's going the other way the staircase one oh my god  here's the vase or two people looking at each other so here's what those books should be called  they should be called brain failures because that's what it is that's what our show should be called  brain is it is it in the diagram is it longer or shorter oh my gosh i can't figure it out but  our hubris prevents us from confessing our own states of ignorance to ourselves we are in did we 
[02:24:00]  have the ability to improve our own intelligence right through computers and all that stuff and  what they're talking about is like uh what ray kerswell talked about a google that you just  all of a sudden uh yeah i'm not fully convinced he's he wants to say a year will come the day will  come where computers the storage capacity the the computing power will be enough to rival and exceed  perhaps the human mind's ability to do this so you just upload your brain and then you become the 
[02:24:30]  computer and then your body doesn't matter anymore and he and everything we know will be different  after that day and i'm just not i gotta one day have a conversation i might get him on star talk just  to have a conversation with him to find out why he thinks this because we've been bested many times  by things we've invented before when the machine came i'm plowing the back 40 um you know with with with  sweat equity and someone said here's a tractor i'm using a tractor and i'm staying at home drinking a 
[02:25:00]  beer i don't have a problem that the tractor can do it better than i can and we got computers that now beat us  at chess that beat the best chess player we got watson okay who who beat the best ever jeopardy  contest but the computer that beat uh the chess player or jeopardy can't plow the field well but  our creations can't beat you at if you could lump all that into one thing and then make it adaptable 
[02:25:30]  and able to grow let that do the work and i'll be in the bahamas call me when you're done  i'm just saying i don't i and to upload your mind fine but the idea that that would still be you  i'm not convinced of that because uh the things in my mind that are not you we have different life  experience that yeah just one of many things that distinguishes one person from another i upload my  mind and then like i said i go to the bahamas i meet people i have a nice dinner is the computer 
[02:26:00]  doing that no yeah yeah it's not so i continue to grow my life experience and my relationships and  and what is the it's stuck in the moment of when i uploaded what i gave it right how could it continue  to be more creative than i can be creative based on new information i've yet to learn that happens  through my world line isn't that in a way the moment the computer is separated from you it has a  different world line yes isn't that looking at like an almost like there's an intangible thing like 
[02:26:30]  when you're saying that like isn't that almost giving credence to the fact that well there's an  intangible a soul or something that can't be quite accounted for like like so it would be it would be  if it the way the science fiction vernacular takes it is has the computer achieved consciousness  self-awareness so that it makes decisions on its own without you even having programmed it in that way  right now computers do exactly what we tell it right they do not what we want it to do what we tell it to  do which are two different things here so they do exactly what we tell it to do because we 
[02:27:00]  programmed them so that was the interesting thing i don't know if you saw watson in action  so that one of the other contestants gives an answer and it turns out to be the wrong answer  watson is still calculating what the answer is and he says okay watson and watson gives  the same answer as the other person  watson hadn't figured out that if someone already gives an answer and it's wrong right you don't give  that answer that answer any dummy would know that any dummy right right right but it kind of opens up 
[02:27:30]  the thing it is there a limit to the human mind um when you said can can we reach a point where we  can't comprehend since i can imagine a life form that has that same dna difference advanced beyond us  that we are from chimps i am humbled by the brilliance that such a life form could bring to  bear on solving problems on i mean just look at how we you we like to say we're smart but just look  at the dumb stuff we do as a species all around the world hey you're living on oil that i want i'm 
[02:28:00]  gonna kill you but meanwhile the whole universe is is is overflowing with energy well i'd be embarrassed  if aliens came here to visit and they say hey how you guys doing with your energy well we're still  pulling fossil fuels out of the ground i want stuff to be more proud of before i start showing off  our civilization to intelligent aliens that happen to visit yeah don't be so don't be so eager to have  them land here right now it's ridiculous we continue to destroy each other and yeah yeah and 
[02:28:30]  everything on earth when you when you start really looking at how tiny earth is compared to the rest of the  universe and let's make everything warmer while we're at it right yeah yeah and flood the coastlines  yeah speaking of earth what how do you feel about the people that think it's only six thousand years  old uh it's they if they think that they think that because that is mandated by their religious  philosophy exactly okay you know i mean i just keep it out of the science classroom that that's all i i don't 
[02:29:00]  try to confuse that with doing science science we have learned science has completely transformed our  culture it's doubled our life expectancy it is brought comfort and health and well-being and and  not only science but the fruits of science the technological fruits of science and of course you  need to be good shepherds of this power because in the wrong hands it could be used for evil all right  this is the great sort of dichomity of great the great of unlocking the secrets of nature so uh so i 
[02:29:30]  don't i'm not going to fight them to tell them the universe is not just stay out of your way no no  not my just the science classroom no no and and and if you want to put it in the science classroom  understand the ramifications right your country will go bankrupt because you will no longer be  in a position to forge the economies of tomorrow that will require uh science and technological  innovation at least the next question because a few people on the lines are asking do you believe in  god i i i'm not convinced if if here's here's the thing if every every time i talk about god with 
[02:30:00]  someone who's a believer god is is is all powerful and all knowing and and and all good right the good  is a big part of this and then i look at all the ways earth wants to kill us you know a tsunami takes out a  quarter million people hurricanes earthquakes tornadoes floods and and i add all that up  either the god is not all powerful or is not all good but it can't really be both given all the ways 
[02:30:30]  the universe wants to kill us and and and if earth is not finished killing you there's the asteroid that  could come in an asteroid rendered 70 of all life forms extinct back in uh that's the famous one in  65 million years ago that took out the dinosaurs so there's so many ways to die not at the hands of 
[02:31:00]  someone else who has free will that i i don't know what what is the nature of the god that you're talking  about i i gotta like try to like use your logic back at you but don't we define what what is good and  what is bad so we see a tsunami wipe out a whole bunch of people and we're as human beings going  wow that's bad because we define what bad is maybe in god's brain eyes whatever the hell that that's  not bad well but except you defined what god is oh boy wow that's that's so why why do you have the 
[02:31:30]  power to define who and what god is right but not have the power to define what good is my point is  we just don't know it all not even close oh sure so so therefore uh if you're going to say god  actually is good and a quarter million people dying from an earthquake and a tsunami and and other  natural disasters um and god presumably has control over that and god is good then we have to then say 
[02:32:00]  god works in mysterious ways right there you go that's that but people only say that  when their understanding of god fails them when it's something bad no no when they can't understand  it they thought god works in mysterious ways but somehow in these other ways you did understand  them right how are you saying well this is the this is the handiwork of god is you doing god's work  god wants you to do this somehow you know god's motives every other way when but when a quarter  million people get wiped out god works in mysterious ways why do you why why do you even claim to have 
[02:32:30]  access to god's mind in some context and not others just admit you have no clue right and get on with  life that's how i look at it we just don't have a clue when it comes down to it well i'd like to think that  preserving health and longevity that is a nice operational definition of something that's good right how can  you argue why how can you debate something that keeps you alive and healthy that's got to be a something 
[02:33:00]  that's good i can't i'm i refuse to allow someone to say i'm going to give you cancer birth defects  and shorten your life and somehow call that good i i'm not going i hear you i'm not going there what  do you think happens when you die didn't we have that part of the conversation earlier in the show  when you're not paying attention no but i said i go into earth and my body right my body's energy  is handed over to i heard you loud and clear no no we can we can measure that if you want to say  something more than that happens you have to step out of objective realities and then believe what 
[02:33:30]  happens on faith and people have faith in a lot of things i don't have an issue with that i but i know  i can measure that i have energy content and a worm is going to capture that energy and a plant is going  to capture the the decomposed carbon dioxide that comes out of my body that's going to happen and  that's not going to satisfy any of us as far as our lives go no but it means your energy lives on in  other life forms on earth i know i i personally find that quite satisfying and has the benefit of 
[02:34:00]  being objectively verifiable nice i have a uh a question about uh asteroids or comets because uh  since shoemaker levy hit uh you guys are nice you guys are up on all shoemaker he's just this is a can  i inform your audience shoemaker levy uh that's a comet discovering team i thought it was a law firm  i think we were sued by that once what happened there's uh david levy and eugene and carolyn shoemaker  are comet hunters yeah and in fact they discovered a a an asteroid a comet and asteroid hunters they 
[02:34:30]  discovered an asteroid that i was so honored that they named in my honor they proposed it it was  accepted there's there's asteroid one three one two three tyson that that team discovered and i'm  quite honored by i checked i had to double check it's not headed towards earth yeah right now i  happily accept the honor so they discovered a comet that had broken apart and was on a collision course  with jupiter and in fact it slammed into jupiter back in the 1990s and it was amazing we observed it 
[02:35:00]  from earth amazing footage there's this big black spot where it hit and you could they said it would  have ruined it it was the size of the earth a little spot that you have the entire scar on jupiter was  bigger than the the planet earth oh right why is that and so whatever's true there's no dinosaurs left  on on jupiter i'm fascinated with that and the fact is that red storm on jupiter how come if that  red storm is just a weather system we still see it why isn't it and why is that that that spot still 
[02:35:30]  as it was 25 years ago no no the spot's long gone oh is it i thought it was still there no no no no  spot spot's long gone now what's cool about the spot this is a impact scar left in the atmosphere  of jupiter because the there's the energy of the collision completely wreaks havoc in the local area  of the atmosphere but here's what's cool there were two dozen or so chunks of this comet that had  broken apart on a previous bypass to jupiter jupiter's gravity disrupted the physical body of the  comet and it created this long train of 24 pieces here's what's cool when the first piece hit the 
[02:36:00]  next piece does not hit in the same spot because jupiter rotates so you got to see every successive  scar as they hit jupiter's surface as jupiter jupiter rotates twice as fast as earth does by the way  and so you got to see the simple fact that jupiter rotates as these pieces all otherwise hitting  the same spot in space right but a different location surface on jupiter's surface so those 
[02:36:30]  have gone away the jupiter's red spot that we've been we've been seeing that for the last three or  four hundred years it's a sustained weather system that still is a bit of a mystery and has it not  maybe i just by the way we don't know we don't have a full we have some provisional answers for how  you can sustain a weather system that long but the universe continues to brim with mysteries  and why should it be you know relative to our life right right yeah thank you you know right  right it's i think about it we have hurricanes that last uh weeks that for sure all right and 
[02:37:00]  that's on earth which is tiny and we don't rotate as fast so now we have jupiter which is you know  jupiter is 10 times wider than we are as a planet rotates twice as fast is mostly gas  all right so a lot jupiter give it some space here to do whatever it wants to with this weather i  mean to a to a mayfly the hurricanes here last uh lifetime you know he's getting philosophical he's 
[02:37:30]  getting deep here now we sent the probe to jupiter and i guess it fell down and then got crushed uh  yes you could say literally yes it did fall but that was on purpose we didn't it didn't actually  oops yeah once you're done with your spacecraft why don't you do the leave one last experiment  to find out what happens as it plunges into uh through the surface that's right how far it'll  ultimately get crushed by the pressure how far down would you make it before you got a human being  yeah yeah uh you would uh suffocate in the vacuum of space before you got to that point but ignoring 
[02:38:00]  that complication okay uh you you go in well it depends on how how structurally stable your ship is  or your skull is but you i mean it's it's not you don't have to think about jupiter to answer this  you just say what kind of pressure you can think about it in the ocean what kind of pressure would  totally crush your body you can't go too far down with like the titanic you know miles down below  the the surface the weight of the water above you would just crush you like a pancake but no like a  crepe yeah the weight of all the pancakes too thick you need something better yeah and uh what is it 
[02:38:30]  right because we have atmospheric pressure here on earth's surface it's 15 pounds per square inch  here's something you might not have known if you put you press a suction cup and you try to lift it up  you can't because it has suction well there's no such thing as suction what's happening is you took away  the air beneath it that was balancing the pressure all around it now you're lifting the entire column of 
[02:39:00]  atmospheric weight that's sitting on top of your suction cup yeah and if your suction cup is four  square inches it's four times 15 pounds per square inch you have to lift 60 pounds of force upwards  to pop it off the table it comes off and you say look it's sucking itself down no the atmosphere is  pressing down on you so now you go underwater you have not only the weight of the air on top of the  water you have the weight of the water on top of you yeah water is heavier than air denser than air  a lot of people get that backwards all the time that it's uh suction but it's actually pressure and 
[02:39:30]  yeah and they say you know nature abhors a vacuum no most of the universe is a vacuum  nature just loves vacuums it's your it's your limited world view that tells you that some  nature somehow hates the absence of air yeah yeah so uh i'm fascinated too with with the uh the voyager  which is uh i remember my science teacher in high school stanley buttcavage told us that what a name  for a teacher wow the abuse but he made such a big deal of the fact when uh voyager one left i want to  say our solar system which i guess was when i was a freshman high school which i guess is 82 
[02:40:00]  and now where about is it it didn't just reach another milestone well it depends on how you  define the solar system generally when you learn the solar system in elementary school it's the  enumeration of the planets back in our day pluto would have been in that list no longer so you could  say when voyager passes the orbit of neptune the the last of the eight planets it has left the solar  system but wait a minute there's a new swath of real estate discovered beyond neptune which is what  got pluto into trouble it's a swath of icy bodies with the same composition and orbits as pluto right 
[02:40:30]  and so that's called the kuiper belt of comets maybe you have to wait till it gets past that  well voyager you know got past that all right and so it's kept going and since then it has passed  the sun's in the influence of the sun's magnetic field on all the particles that float around in  space and it is crossed into the magnetic field of the galaxy and that's what made headlines just  recently which would have been much later than when you were in high school of course that they 
[02:41:00]  were probably finding some other boundary of the solar system to reference maybe it was when it  passed pluto or something i don't i don't remember launch no i think when did it go up in like 77 or  something oh when it's launched yeah uh 1977 that's correct voyager one and two yeah and they said it's  being powered by something that's like a little light bulb like worth of power oh yeah it's i forgot  was a 10 watts or so a very very low wattage yeah dimmer that lower energy consumption than your  refrigerator light that's amazing so yeah that's what's powering the whole thing and it has 70k 
[02:41:30]  of memory nice oh that was that was talking you were talking back that was that was back in the 70s  you you got a date if you had 70k of memory yikes and what now we all know a klingon took um target  practice on it though right to that star trek no anyone a v-ger star trek or v-ger yeah yeah  yeah there's v-ger in star trek uh in the original star trek what you know what gets me about v-ger 
[02:42:00]  it was voyager that apparently the the oya was rusted over yeah in the voyager and v-ger had acquired  all knowledge of the universe achieved consciousness and then came back to look for its creator and i'm  just thinking if it acquired all the knowledge of the universe why didn't it know its name was voyager  you'd think it would have figured that out yeah okay and also just to be fair that was voyager six  not either the voyager one or two the worst of the week countdown countdown you did it you reached 
[02:42:30]  the top of the countdown i'm sam roberts and this is the number one bit from the opian anthony show  this week now uh if you missed any of this of course it replays throughout the weekend and  and it's available on demand plus what are you doing missing shows anyway you know what i mean  it's on every weekday morning starting at 6 a.m here on the opian anthony channel uh ron howard  believe it or not stopped by the opian anthony show this week the original opi we didn't expect him 
[02:43:00]  we didn't know he was coming but he got to the building and he said i got to do that goddamn opian  anthony show and you know what he sure as hell did it ron howard the original opi here  on the opian anthony shows who works for the week countdown  number one ron how you doing ron surprise surprise it is a surprise buddy pleasant surprise how are  you good to see you again man that's tammy pescatelli a funny comic how are you nice to see you i'm jim 
[02:43:30]  really good actor he's a closer for sure he constantly tries to sell himself and why not  and why not directors that come in here you look you look thinner you look good i'm uh you know  what i'm doing a movie called heart of the sea which is a survival story a true story and all the  actors are on a reduced diet now i don't have to do this thing oh man somehow it's a gets a pretty  good influence this with chris hemsworth all everybody very oh what's the gist of this it's 
[02:44:00]  actually uh uh based on the the events that actually inspired herman melville to write moby  dick oh wow which is a whale ship was sunk in 1820 and the survival story is the one that has was a  big story of course in in its era but nobody knows much about now and it's a pretty uh pretty remarkable  adventure story so what exactly is that what are you eating uh well i'm just i'm just being a little  healthier i'm just being a little healthier that's really just eating less of everything and a little  more exercise it gets addicting though when people start to notice it it feels kind of good to hear  like a nice compliment and then you're like yeah i kind of want to keep fishing for one jim 
[02:44:30]  we didn't know we were getting ron howard today you were in the building i guess i'm uh yeah i'm  here today is that you filming outside no no not at all no oh yeah they probably all the actors  probably sit up straighter when they see him there's a another screening project imagination uh 10 short 
[02:45:00]  films uh and i've i've been sort of a you know a part of this this is the second the second season  uh of of this project canon sponsors it and it's been um you know it's been really a blast and  last year my daughter bryce made a movie and and it was a situation where um the you know the the  concept was people send in photographs for various dramatic categories you know a setting character and  so forth and then those would get winnowed down by the public and then finally i would select 
[02:45:30]  uh a one photo for each category and then in this case last year bryce had to go take those  take her inspiration from that make a movie and she wound up you know sort of an academic experiment  or a cool creative experiment she wound up making a very personal very interesting movie she even got  on the short list for the for the oscars last year they decided to do it this year and and and this  year they got five um celebrity filmmakers but people who are not known as directors or haven't  directed very much yet and then they also opened it up to the public so tonight they're going to be 
[02:46:00]  ten films and not only is it eva longoria and jamie foxx and uh and the other and the other  celebrities uh but it's you know it's also five five uh filmmakers who just took it upon themselves to  look at the photographs take some inspiration from that make a movie hundreds and hundreds came in  yeah i saw the commercials that were running for uh bryce and i were the judges on that yeah  absolutely blown really by the creativity and that's honestly what i really like about the  the whole the whole project is it's it's it's terrific if jamie foxx gets to make a movie but 
[02:46:30]  it's not surprising if it's going to be if it's cool right right but you know when you get these  movies coming in ambitious movies really incredibly creative incredibly entertaining uh and you realize  that that's one of the things that technology is doing isn't it amazing uh that what's available  to the the the amateur or layman uh as far as technology goes stuff that wasn't available to  professionals just a few years ago well and the whole thing is kind of blending because uh uh you 
[02:47:00]  know on on on the movie rush that's that that's out right now congrats by the way oh thank you  thank you seriously i really had a great time you gotta be proud of that yeah no thank you thank you  well part of our challenge was to try to you know um recreate this world in uh you know in a  very authentic very personal intense particular sort of way and uh we we wound up using cannons a lot  not not because i came in and said you know i we got to use cannons but dodd mantel who is extremely 
[02:47:30]  experimental and did a fantastic job with rush really pushing the envelope and he always has using  technology and and among among his tools and a great solution for a lot of our problems turned  out to be uh the canon professional models and uh so you know it's uh the two the two worlds are kind  of are kind of blending no big uh what paniflex or uh not so much something like that it is amazing  we had all kinds of cameras i mean yeah yeah and and and and again that's what it was that's what was 
[02:48:00]  required and uh you know it was an interesting challenge because speaking of technology we used  you know every tool in the contemporary movie makers kit to try to hopefully make audiences feel  like they were just transported back into the 70s and experiencing that world and and uh and those  characters so it was a tremendous creative challenge and and uh and it was you know and it was it was made a  lot easier due to due to technology have you seen technology hurting the storylines at all or hurting some of 
[02:48:30]  the writing in movies i don't think so and and and a lot of people say that going back to when digital  editing first really you know came in 15 20 years ago um and uh i personally don't but my mind sort of is  attracted to variety uh options you know that's why i make a lot of different kinds of movies  absolutely the whole thing's kind of an exploration and so anything that makes the creative process 
[02:49:00]  leaner uh is also then naturally becomes more personal and so for me i'm feeling that i i can get to what  was in my mind a lot more often now than i could even you know eight ten years ago yeah you've been  through filmmaking throughout where you had to you know sit there and literally cut the i've got my i've  got my my eight millimeter splicer yeah so it has to i would almost think it leaves more time for the 
[02:49:30]  creativity to to not have to worry that you're going to take such a chunk of time to to do stuff now  that you could do a lot faster it it ought to work that way but you know you know how it is with the  man if they know you can do it faster they want it faster they want it cheaper yeah yeah but what it  does is i just think it creates a kind of um fluidity i think i think there are you know there  are more options i think the danger is if people start spinning so fast that they don't stop and 
[02:50:00]  they really think about what their story is they don't think about an innovative way of doing it  they just kind of you know they just sort of blast into it and and and and do everything on the on on  the fly that that style was something that we applied to rush but it was not done on the fly  right it was very conscious very thoughtful kind of like the ethical the 3d uh technology when it  first hit they didn't really care about the story as much it's just like wow now you can see movies  in 3d and finally they're starting to realize okay people are over that now we still got to make a 
[02:50:30]  interesting film well you know i don't know five maybe seven years ago bob zemeckis a peer of mine  and a friend uh he's great innovator you know he did uh who framed roger rabbit if forrest gump back to  the future movies you know always pushing the envelope um visually but he gave a great quote  which he said soon audiences are going to recognize that visually anything's possible  right and what's it going to mean it's just going to bring everything back to story and character  and what is it all add up you could look at him i mean there are movies that are visually amazing 
[02:51:00]  and they're not good movies because the story is terrible and vice versa there's great stories that  use barely anything as far as uh effects go and uh that's great so it's always story driven i think  is the most important thing with with that said did you see gravity and what i haven't seen it i've  been i've been you haven't seen it it hasn't opened in europe yet and that's where i've been okay and  so i'm you know i'm i've heard nothing but great things i think it's visually just amazing stunning  i think it's gonna i think it's a fantastic fall shaping up and and uh yeah do you ever love hate with 
[02:51:30]  movies like that like because if it's one that you haven't done you're like ah that's great oh i hate it  because it's hard to watch it you know rush is a lot about rivalry and so so i've been thinking a  little bit about this as it relates to um you know in well anytime the award season comes along  rush got a lot of good reviews it makes you you know wonder where you you know would you be in are  you on the bubble which is the film in the mix you do care about that of course of course because  it's a matter of pride sure and it means a lot to the movie and means a lot to the people 
[02:52:00]  you know in this case the editors did stellar work the cinematographer fantastic work  tom zimmer score is remarkable so there you know there are a lot of categories daniel brulee who  played nikki lauda is you know just just did oh amazing career level work so so you know you're  you're you're not only rooting for the movie but you're you're uh you're rooting for for those  those people as well but but of course so you look at it and you see a movie a great movie  and i'm still very much a fan so i don't see it and start resenting it it's the car ride home where 
[02:52:30]  i say what does that what does that person know that i don't know damn it howard get with it but  you've worked with uh tom hanks obviously uh uh did you see um captain phillips is great yeah yeah  really that uh i did see that that opened the end uh what he pulls off in that um like uh  examination don't give it away i won't i'm just saying it's it's amazing came back all you have  to know is you know tom hanks is is he makes it look kind of easy but he's a dedicated artist and 
[02:53:00]  he's a great talent and a great guy to work with but you know what what a year broadway you know i  mean he uh he's he's he's he's been given a lot of accolades but he deserves everyone that comes  you've worked with him early in like splash and then uh later on apollo 13 uh did what kind of  difference did you notice any at all in his acting or well i think at the beginning he really thought  he was going to be a comedic actor right i think that's you know he began in theater and then he 
[02:53:30]  made his breakthroughs you know in television and then movie comedies and uh it had been about 10 or  11 years uh i we stayed friendly and i certainly saw all of his movies and i saw what was happening  uh to him is broadening you know the kinds of roles he was tackling uh but when i started directing  him in apollo 13 it was interesting because the moments in between the dialogue the moments in  between the scripted intentional planned ideas were suddenly rich and really alive and to me that's 
[02:54:00]  sort of when he was and it was perhaps prior to apollo 13 he had become a great great screen actor one of  those guys that just that holds the screen because there's more going on than just what the writer wrote  there's parts of uh when you watch him act that you can tell it's it's him it's an odd thing there's  this sense of humor that he has there's a scene in apollo 13 as a matter of fact when uh they're having  that argument uh on board the ship and then he uh he has to talk on the radio and he goes down real low 
[02:54:30]  back in control and that was so tom hanks it was kind of a funny moment and uh well yeah that was  really good acting is supposed to be bringing you into the character which is yeah i wouldn't know  doesn't it really look i know no i trust me well it's we just go radio tom's also a good writer and  he's a good director and so he's he's uh you know he's he's as as as as all as all the great actors 
[02:55:00]  do they not only bring know how to bring their character to life but they also really understand  what's going on and they have a good communication going with the director and and and they and a real  sensitivity to what the movie needs and the best actors not only show up and do a great job with their  role but they also know how to ask you know smart questions tough questions and keep sort of um you  know there's sort of a creative x factor in a movie see you know i feel the best method of acting is i  like to let the other person finish their dialogue and where their lips stop moving 
[02:55:30]  i know your time bullshit bullshit bullshit  oh my god i want to ask you a question with all this chaos that's surrounding some of these young  child stars that have trans you know uh ascended into adulthood and had all these problems i mean  you are the epitome of the child star but the success story what do you think was the difference  for you i mean i i love how your brothers and i mean i we just watched the grinch talk about a kid 
[02:56:00]  we watched the grinch last night you see clint and we just see all that you know it's just great  i like clinton guys it is tranya captain  that's my favorite part of just to find him and all that you know he's he's he's great he's a  really really good strong character actor and i you know look we uh our you know our our parents  were were terrific and did a great job i don't really know because i you know this is just my 
[02:56:30]  life and it's and and accept that i i know i always liked it i never had confusion over it i  never had ambivalence about is this really what i want to be and that and this would even you know  even when you know not to go to some play but you when you're adolescent and you're struggling  you're not getting as much work and you know bullies are teasing you or our kids are you know or  are are hassling you they used to sing the andy griffith theme song while i was at the free throw  trying to shoot free throws 
[02:57:00]  that was never too great a trade-off i mean right right i oh i loved going to work and i love being  a part of this creative process and um it's uh and and so i didn't have that ambivalence i didn't  struggle with that between uh the andy griffith show and happy days was kind of uh i guess not 
[02:57:30]  really i mean you were obviously working but not as much as well there's a period time when you you  reach a point where the child labor right right really impractical wow because if you could get  somebody who's over a certain age now it's i think lowered a little bit to 16 there's kind of a market  but it used to be 18 if you could get somebody who looks say 14 or 15 that is 18 they can work they  can work all hours just like any adult now but the 15 year old 16 17 year old is still limited by 
[02:58:00]  child labor laws right it's a very practical issue and it it just naturally sort of crushes any  momentum yeah that shuts you out of roles obviously how are you feeling about uh tv these days because  tv's getting a newfound respect as far as uh shows like breaking bad and um you were great on you  were great on arrested development yes that was terrific i love being a part of arrested development  and and uh and and it's it's you know back to back to technology arrested development never would  have come back had it not been first the internet you know then dvds then netflix yeah you know it's it's 
[02:58:30]  uh um and without a without a question a television to me has sort of evolved into this  you know this this i mean it's always been great work is great work and there's always right been  there on tv but uh uh you know i i i love what's happening there as a filmmaker it's it's i'm sure  you see it's it's gotten a newfound respect where legitimate actors let's say are willing to do uh 
[02:59:00]  well tv for one thing they've shortened the schedule so that actors don't feel like they're  signing their entire career right on some kind of a treadmill yeah but in writers as well um and  also again back back to back to technology uh the television shows are able to operate on a  reasonable enough budget and yet be a little more cinematic a little more ambitious and cable has  allowed the freedom for them to to be as authentic and true to life as as uh as as movies so you know 
[02:59:30]  we're no question we're in a whole entertainment technology social revolution and uh you know  there's some it's it's exciting on a lot of levels it's daunting on a lot of levels it's  upsetting the economy in certain ways and you know and so it's i i don't know if people in the middle  of the industrial revolution or the renaissance knew what was happening to them at the time but  in hindsight but we're in it yeah it's exciting oh man yeah freaking out always fun to talk to you  thank you so much thanks thanks ron ron howard everyone that's the best you got from us i mean

[03:04:00]  fun fun fun stuff that's genius amazing i love it i love it it's the opian anthony fu line and if  your call doesn't suck it just might make it on the air fuck yeah this is friends of the show  friends of the show audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the  show this week rich boss and bonnie mcfarley's podcast my wife hates me earlier we talked about 
[03:04:30]  taking a test with dr steve we now him have him on the phone with our test results and the test was  are bonnie and i compatible did i did i get that right i guess so we'll see let's hear what dr  steve has to say what was the test called and what can you give us a little background on it  welcome absolutely thank you thank you for having me um this was a myers-briggs type indicator test now 
[03:05:00]  what this is is just a questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people  perceive the world and make decisions so this is not uh something that says one thing is better than  the other or one thing is good and the other thing is bad it just talks about preferences now look  uh i love you guys as a couple i really do it is actually the axis of evil it's very entertaining but 
[03:05:30]  it's interesting that if you listen i've listened to every single one of your podcasts uh and if when  you listen to them you can tell that you two guys are very much alike except in how you kind of relate  to the world around you and so that was why i came up with this idea of doing this myers-briggs thing  now how long has this test been around like what's the well uh carl young actually developed the um 
[03:06:00]  the the four subtypes that we're going to talk about today and then myers and briggs kind of did  this back and i don't know if it was i guess it was around the 40s or early 50s and it's been around  ever since and it's something that businesses use i had to take it in medical school and uh my wife and  i took it because we were having some issues communicating and it turns out that she and i are completely  opposite in the way that we interact with the world and it was really helpful to us  to uh to understand those those differences uh when we fucking argue you know we don't we don't 
[03:06:30]  take it to the to the uh to the brink anymore because we kind of understand that and and you  know look i don't want to ruin your chemistry either because half of the fun is listening to you  to argue about stuff well i want to tell you i the last time i took a test on the internet i took an  iq test and i got a 141 nice 141 iq i believe that's probably accurate so anyway i think it's 
[03:07:00]  143 but um 41 i'm almost a genius let me just say this about the test it is lengthy and it is it's  pretty intense it's like it's a it's yes and no it's like a lot like which word appeals to you more  you know that kind of thing right so yeah and some of the things are really hard to kind of nail down  in your own mind you know which one of these things do i have a preference for right uh you  know because sometimes you're like yeah you i don't know you get a little confused sometimes yes 
[03:07:30]  and then um also then rich had the added issue of not knowing what a lot of those words meant  you did ask me a lot of the words no i didn't and i asked you a couple i mean for like 10 questions  i think i was you were off i was i was answering them as if uh yeah you you you didn't read the  instructions for a few for anyway it doesn't matter let's let's let's get right to it let's get to the  reason first of all don't say let's get right to it when you've been talking for like 10 minutes it's 
[03:08:00]  not if you would have said let's get right to it you would have said that right from the beginning  i want people to know what we're doing so let's get to it now not like right to it okay i pardon me  okay i really apologize for saying right to it uh i'm just trying to point out awful person i am  i'm trying to point out and you're pushing me away from the mic like it's you know it's both of our  mics here let's just try to do this without arguing because we we had we didn't stop talking 
[03:08:30]  yeah well looking at your results good luck with that one so let's talk about your results  earlier he said our results oh look at this he's going to spring on some real uh uh all right let's  go yeah well let's let me talk a little bit about the the general results and then we'll talk about  your specific results uh the myers-briggs type indicator uh divides things into four what they  call dichotomies okay and and and these things have words that you think you know the definition 
[03:09:00]  two but they're using them differently okay so each dichotomy has specific technical meaning so  one is extroversion and and introversion so people who prefer extroversion draw energy from action and  they tend to act and then reflect and then act further if they're inactive their motivation tends  to decline um introverts uh tend to uh uh deal with things um they expend they expend energy through 
[03:09:30]  action they prefer to reflect and then act and then reflect again and this is where uh you get  your energy you know it's where people recharge their batteries so extroverts are kind of people  and things and introverts are thoughts and ideas now interestingly both of you are um introverts in  that and remember this isn't talking about some computer nerd sitting in their room scared to talk to  somebody this is how you kind of recharge your battery and so you both of you prefer to do this 
[03:10:00]  through thought uh first but uh rich or bonnie and rich both are kind of slight introverts in other  words you're the you're the introversion trait is not very strong okay so you could be uh on the  borderline between being an introvert and an extrovert does that make sense so far this sounds right  okay yeah so i we're on the borderline yes you are both on the borderline on that one now the next  one is so we're both basically the same you are very yes in that regard you two are very close to 
[03:10:30]  being the same uh the next dichotomy is sensing and intuition so sensors tend to focus on the present  and real concrete information gained from their senses and in and into intuitive people or the people  who are strong in the intuition dichotomy tend to focus on the future with a view toward patterns and  then possibilities and interestingly uh you were both uh intuitive in in in the definition that they're 
[03:11:00]  using although bonnie was very clear and rich was wishy-washy again he was slight slightly um uh on the  intuitive side now look let me just go through these and then we'll talk about what this really  means as far as your personality and how you deal with stuff so the next one is thinking and feeling  and thinkers base their decisions primarily on logic and analysis of cause and effect and feelers 
[03:11:30]  base their decisions primarily on values and you know evaluations of person-centered concerns  so uh both of you are thinkers in that regard and it was uh rich again was wishy-washy with slight  uh preference for thinking over uh feeling and bonnie was very clear uh in her preference on thinking  versus uh feeling so now look yeah because she doesn't think so no it's well let me uh farting during the 
[03:12:00]  our analysis please don't talk to dr steve that way stop let me let me tell you this thinkers usually  have trouble interacting with people who are inconsistent or illogical and they tend to give  very direct feedback to others and both of you guys were thinkers according to this although rich again  was less strong than bonnie but then but you're saying i'm less strong when it comes to that that 
[03:12:30]  makes me stronger in the other aspect but he's not giving he's not insulting you no i don't get it  but no wait we'll discuss later this is just preferences it means that you you have a slight  preference for thinking over feeling but you also have some aspects of uh uh feeling as well in your  personality okay but that wouldn't be wishy-washy that would be now i'm being an asshole you're right  it's it just means no no because the people that listen to this shit would go and you're right they 
[03:13:00]  don't get it i was using i was i'm not defensive but if i'm if if you're saying yeah in general i think  things out but sometimes i go with my feelings right that's that's kind of a normal person right that's  not a wishy-washy person dude all of this is is is normal and and you're right i used a bad  word i was just i guess i was trying to be funny it's um when i say wishy-washy it just means that you 
[03:13:30]  have a very slight preference for these things and you could go either way and but but the preference  is there that both all both of you uh prefer the introverted um or you know introversion in your way  of uh deriving energy and uh you're both in uh prefer intuition and you both prefer thinking  over feeling so all three of those are the same it's just that bonnie's are more 
[03:14:00]  strong in those directions and rich's are less strong in those so rich rich is acting like you've  said like you're bisexual um no no i just mean you're right right right well i'm going to tell  you why he thinks that because the next one is the really interesting one okay okay and that is  judging versus perception i'll go into some detail with this because uh the fourth preference describes 
[03:14:30]  how you like to live your outer life and what are the behaviors other tend to see okay so do you  prefer a more structured and decided lifestyle which is judging or a more flexible and adaptable  lifestyle which is perceiving this does not mean that a person who is strong in the judging preference  is judgmental okay that's not remember these words don't describe the things that you know are not the  don't have the definitions that we're used to so judging types will thrive when information is organized 
[03:15:00]  and structured and they'll be motivated to complete assignments to gain closure while perceiving types  will flourish in a flexible learning environment when they're stimulated by new and exciting ideas now  rich is very strong in judging so he likes a planned and organized approach to life and prefers to have  things settled whereas bonnie yeah is very strong in perception or perceiving she likes a flexible and 
[03:15:30]  spontaneous approach to life and prefers to keep her options open so that responsible being  irresponsible no listen i take offense to that i um no i keep going we didn't mean to cut you off but  i like uh things to go as planned yes yes oh some people might call that controlling but let's just  find out let's just find out no it's not controlling it's paying your bills doing what you got to do 
[03:16:00]  i've always paid my bill i'm just i'm using examples i didn't say you don't pay your bills  all right go ahead i'm saying it's it's it's what it is is being it's being like a foreman on a child  how about you look at this the answers to this test is uh no one's winning there's no winning i'm not  you're no you're no you're acting like we're going to decide who's the better person no i'm not at all  which is why you took offense to the wishy-washy comment because that in your mind was a was a negative 
[03:16:30]  on your character yes we're gonna for what once and for all decide who's the best character in  this house is that how you're looking at this test no no because that's not what it is it's you know  what this is this is a way to better communicate yes another okay well if you can't see that the way  that you're responding to things right now is defensive no i was only i was trying to win  no no that's you don't ever take a yoga class okay because there's no winning in yoga okay that's 
[03:17:00]  you i was just saying when he said wishy-washy only because of our audience right how they perceive  oh yeah yeah that's and now you're slamming our audience oh yeah they're fucking wishy-washy  that's all right let's go the use of wishy i apologize for that that was unfortunate i think it  was fine he you know he he tends to get upset if you don't use the words that he wants you to use  which i think might be controlling but let's find out everything is always so controlling with you 
[03:17:30]  well here's the thing when you when you combine all of these things together  moving right along you know we could make a marriage counselor quit  maybe we should go do that see like how long it takes for marriage counseling to kick us out  if you ever did go this would be valuable to give them because all marriage counselors will use  these myers-briggs uh things or at least be familiar with them so uh combining all of these 
[03:18:00]  things rich is i n t j so that's the those are the four things you need to remember and bonnie is i n t p  and you guys although you're not as strong on the i n and t you're both very strong on the j and the p  which is very apparent to people who listen to this show or the the conversation that just went on  okay so let me talk a little bit about how uh intjs can lose out uh in the world and there's a lot of 
[03:18:30]  positive things there's nothing negative about this other than uh some sometimes um uh these personality  types will clash excuse me one second yeah sure you seen you said did you just say let me tell you  how i and tj people can lose out in the world well he's saying like here let me give you some  i'm going to give you both no the better you can do but when the word lose all right go ahead  maybe i'm just hearing it all i'm sorry well by losing out let me let me just read from this 
[03:19:00]  each type has the potential to overuse or abuse its preferences that's each type this is likely  to happen when individuals are under great stress or pressure at these times they may act in ways that  are unlike their usual style the following and so anyway so one way that intjs can lose out and i'll do  intps next uh they intjs may ignore the impact of their style on others and they often who's the  intjs you know me yeah would you rather i do bonnie first i'll say i like me i say bad things about 
[03:19:30]  bonnie first and then i'll come back no no do me i want to hear the bad no i want to hear i can  maybe become a better person oh you're such a phony i'm phony tell me first start with the intjs okay i  will the now remember the purpose of this is to help you guys understand how the other one uh processes  information also to give you some insight as to how you process information okay so i already know 
[03:20:00]  how he processes information i think it's better for me to know how you know it's harder to look  at yourself sometimes yeah it is finish the intj okay so the intj go ahead he started with it i'm not  controlling so the intjs people may see them as unyielding and detached and so logical that they may be  afraid to approach or challenge them and the other way that intjs can lose out is to become obsessed  with unimportant details they their need to control all possibilities results results in them being 
[03:20:30]  unable to focus on what is really necessary and so listen knowing this about yourself is a good  he didn't even listen he's not even taking it in he's only just waiting for you to say something  positive that's all that is very positive i can say a lot of positives  he's literal he's controlling he says things to people that and doesn't care how they feel about 
[03:21:00]  it i didn't do it again that's that's what it is let's talk about an intj in love though here you go  intj men tend to be attracted to partners who enjoy living their lives with an outward vitality and zest  what do you think of that that sounds right i mean i saw that they tamp it out of you  over the years until you're a wretched human being just like them oh god fucking zest  let's see here okay so okay uh they gave an example of an intj woman that was a conference planner 
[03:21:30]  and when the uh site of one of the events changed she wrote the change on each of the 200 tickets that  had been printed she could have simply posted a sign directing people to the new site only half a  block away so they will sometimes focus on small details and lose sight of the big picture and that's  something that's important for us to understand about ourselves when we have that let's talk a little 
[03:22:00]  bit about intps well you didn't say anything positive about the intjs well how interesting is that i said  that you're uh um okay let me look and i'll find something positive okay well that's not true let's  see um okay intjs learn best when they can design their own approach and when they're able to absorb  themselves in an area that interests them they're diligent in pursuing new ideas and thoughts and they 
[03:22:30]  exert effort to master a given subject and i think you know just looking at your stand-up that is  certainly true you know you worked at it worked and worked at it until you mastered it but what  was your plan before you like if i didn't ask you a positive thing i'm not i'm not tearing you down but  you threw out a bunch of intj negative things right and there are positive things well the test probably  hasn't even happened it's going by what's on the paper man did he make that up you think he made that  up about intj he probably went to a different one yeah yeah because i mean i can't be completely 
[03:23:00]  negative i focus no no you're right i am a very precise person every psychologist listening to  this is fucking yelling at their radio right now at me because i am fucking this up if you think that  there is um that this is a negative thing this is a this is a way for you to learn about how you  interact with the world let me let me let me talk to you both a little bit about the difference  between j and p too because you're a nice thing i know and you're just like i'm not i'm just trying 
[03:23:30]  to figure it out talk about how i really like to talk about tattoos no no no you fucking idiot  what i'm i'm trying to get like when he says here's the thing when he says uh they're very  precise or they go after some more smaller details not the whole overall picture but the small  he said they can okay but the small details lead to the big picture in my opinion maybe i'm wrong  you see what i'm saying that is your opinion and that's and that's not a bad opinion that it's just 
[03:24:00]  how you deal with those things yeah that's not a bad thing okay shit i'm getting paged okay it's  someone it's uh it's bristol or myers or whoever the two guys  he's making a mockery of our test it's either johnson and johnson or whoever the two  listen to this  it's it's ernest or young but um do you see though and i just want to bring this up a little bit 
[03:24:30]  uh for rich to to acknowledge this without getting mad look at he's already getting mad  i'm not getting something up but you defended yourself against the test like you won't take  anything in without fighting back well because i didn't really pay it i gotta hear it again i gotta  soak it in i'm just this is well then don't fight back just soak in i but i i can't even barely 
[03:25:00]  remember what he said i know he said that i i focus on smaller issues sometimes when you get  in a in a high uh stress situation you will say things that are not really in your nature maybe you  don't uh um perceive how you're you you appear to other people or you know it's like when you get  mad and you're mean to people you don't you don't think in that moment you're mean to them and then  you know an hour later you call them and you after you thought about it you say oh i was mean i'm 
[03:25:30]  sorry i'm not really mean to people okay but no no occasionally rich you are okay so that's one of  the things take that in that's part of your that came out on the test okay this isn't magic you know  you didn't hand in some something for for dr steve to smell you uh your time's up you wrote out  you hear the buzzer yeah you know and so he's giving you the answers now you're arguing with a 
[03:26:00]  piece of paper okay let's go to the queen and see what's going on it's not it's not a queen thing  i'm just i want you to sometimes not fight back that's all i'm not fighting back i'm inquiring and the  truth is that i want you to fight back most of the time because that's your personality and that's  what makes you the most genius comedian that has ever lived i'm inquiring i'm not fighting back i'm  inquiring there's a difference okay but it sounds like okay but i'm being defensive i'm not i'm 
[03:26:30]  inquiring have you ever been like yeah i can get like that well have you ever ever said that in your  life well i guess that sounds some yeah yeah sometimes when someone goes oh he's anxiety  anxiety stricken well anxiety is something you own you like that part of no i don't like it i hate well  you talk about it a lot because i deal with it a lot i'm dealing with it but anytime somebody says  you're an insult comic or you're mean you definitely fight because i'm not a mean person deep down i'm  not a mean person then you need to show that more often i do show but people don't see it you don't  see why do you think people don't see it because see i do nice look at what i i know when i listen 
[03:27:00]  last night the blue light would have taken me up to the sky in that movie the blue light would  oh in the end of the world yeah listen they're not saying that you're mean but they the test does  say that you may ignore the impact of your style on other people and that you often don't care what  what they think but let's talk a little bit about bonnie because that's really what makes him really 
[03:27:30]  good on stage is that he just yeah doesn't care what they think i couldn't do that because i want  people to like me and uh i do care what people think and so you know i don't say things off the  top of my head a lot of times well rich does want people to like him but he wants people to like him  at his worst right now on my terms on your terms yeah so yeah like me on my terms or else don't like  me because then you're not really like most people want you to like them regardless so i'm just saying  and i think you're the better person for it well but most people get defensive about i'm not being but 
[03:28:00]  most people are phony to get them to like them that is that is one of the things that makes you a  great comic there's no question about that you know there's a lot of other things involved in  that and the quickness of wit and all that stuff but the fact that you don't give a shit what people  think of you at that moment is is a very positive thing you know it's it's it's why you're where you  are you know uh let's talk a little bit about bonnie uh and this this will be interesting given  what just transpired uh intps may lose out in focusing their attention on the inconsistencies 
[03:28:30]  of others they may therefore be perceived as continually acting in a negative way  they say that one more time they said they may therefore be perceived as continually acting in a  negative way and i've bonnie i've heard you say that you know i go in and i rip the pictures of  rich off the walls and they get mad at me and i don't understand why you know uh they may appear 
[03:29:00]  aloof and fault-finding and are surprised when others don't readily warm up to them aloof did you say  aloof yes oh they may appear um okay here an intp was astounded to learn that his spouse took  personally his logical impersonal comment so when when bonnie says to rich you know you can sometimes 
[03:29:30]  be this way and then he he he uh becomes defensive about it often you may be astounded that he's  defended you were just or offended by it you were just stating a fact um some possible strategies for  the intp include being friendly and showing appreciation to others from an intp perspective  this may feel like going overboard they may find benefit in taking the necessary time to learn more  about others both personally and professionally and learning the skills of small talk oh small talk i 
[03:30:00]  know there you go right but i do feel like over the years i have learned that about myself and i do try  to do that more yeah like i do realize people definitely need more coddling than i feel like they should  need i mean that is that sounds very that sounds very right i mean i've had people say i have like  you know uh uh empathy chip missing well yeah because here's the thing bonnie doesn't see this and i do 
[03:30:30]  and i mean i love her and everything i think she's cool but she you know as much as i uh don't care  what people you know what react to what i say for some reason bonnie rubs people the wrong way and she  even said that the other day and we don't know what it is what the reason is why she rubs people the  wrong way because she's a nice person she's always looking out for other female comics she's always  helping other comics but yet she says i rub people the wrong way yeah why so is that in your 
[03:31:00]  test well um i was complimenting you kind of no one likes her um so is there something that can be  done well being you know i feel like i don't think people get you they don't get you i think yeah i  think i'm joking a lot of times that people don't say with me we both joke that's right our me my  meanness a lot of times is joking and so is your and people don't get us like this you know the 
[03:31:30]  comment that you know came up to us we go hey hey hey uh you know calm down you know you're well go  ahead sorry that we're cutting you off but you know no no dude it's your show you're you're the  interesting ones not me i'm just reading from you are you are no i think you're wonderful super  interesting and i feel good about you doing this for us thank you very good very good she's in love 
[03:32:00]  with you no she was doing the book rich oh i can't keep up with all this psychological  mumbo jumbo what the fuck i do have a weird thing where i don't like small talk where i can't  i don't like doing like even when i have to take raina to the bus like today i just sort of  i walked the other way i like from the mom so i didn't have to because i was like it's just the  same thing about the weather again yeah but i don't mind talking to the moms and you know those  moms are sitting there going well that fucking bitch but the i'm sure they do sometimes because 
[03:32:30]  i do sometimes have a hard time you appear aloof but you're not and that's the thing it's an  it's an outside appearance but you there are things that you can do about that if you don't  want to appear that way now look this is a preference again you don't have to do anything about it  it's not wrong it's just the way it is but if you don't want to appear aloof then you have to  work on that thing which is called small talk because that's that's how people judge you on  that you know that's your external um your external appearance real quick again what do i got to work 
[03:33:00]  on i forgot you don't have to work on anything you're you're good dude no i'm not good but i can't  be good if uh it didn't sound good well i mean it doesn't things you could work on is how you  related to what he told you about your test because you just defended yourself and then  didn't learn anything no takeaways that's what i'm saying what can i work on okay well okay that  you had to like wait until i was getting attention then you were like oh wait i didn't get that kind 
[03:33:30]  of attention you didn't get that kind of attention because of how you responded no and i have and i know  right now i'm doing exactly what the test says today just focusing on your negative but i see  it clearly because you know you you you know what know what the problem with her is she likes to look  at other people without looking at herself no i like to look at myself i just it's harder to figure 
[03:34:00]  out myself it's easy you know it's easier to to break somebody down to build you up which you're  doing subconsciously is when you tear me down is to build yourself up i honestly don't feel like i  tear you down uh you don't know the truth i feel like sometimes i'm trying to help you navigate the  world better you know i want i've been doing fine i've been doing fine i know but sometimes i feel like  you're not experiencing any joy in life it's because you can't try to tear me down no when you okay 
[03:34:30]  like she'll say go play golf now i'll play golf and then she'll go well if you didn't play golf today  we could have done because then you want to do 18 other things and it's like well you you spend  eight hours playing golf okay here we go yes you spend a lot of time playing golf and then you can't  do every single thing i know but i try to get a lot done i try to get a lot done all right so i gotta go  no no don't go and by that i mean like i gotta pass  oh well okay that that that also fits into your type too bonnie because it says here 
[03:35:00]  that um when it comes to loving intp uh love has three distinct phases falling in staying in and  getting out these these phases relate to their thinking preference and its need for order and  sequence that doesn't you know you may get out 50 years from now when one of you dies that doesn't  mean that you're always going to leave the people that you're with you think he's gonna live 50 more 
[03:35:30]  years come on give a girl something to hope for wait a second uh see i'm a cancer and i'm very we're  not doing that we're not doing astrology that's not what we're doing right now well are we complete  opposites are we basically no we're not we have three similar and one very different right and 
[03:36:00]  this is all this is is the the one that's very different has to do with the way that you interact  with the outside world so that's why you guys clash so much and just understanding that that you perceive  and uh and uh judge things differently uh could lead toward you guys having a better understanding in  your relationship now look you rich you asked me what can you do because i talked about what bonnie  can do uh first off i'm going to send you guys all this stuff and it'd be good to read it's just good 
[03:36:30]  to know about yourself and then how it helps you if you know yourself well hey i'm doing that or i'm  going down that script again and then just rewriting the scripts uh can go a long way toward making you  just happier in general um i i s int j's um as a strategy need to take the time to foster their  relationships and consider their impact on others and they should not assume that others think the  same way that they do they need to make sure that they've shown appreciation to others and are allowed 
[03:37:00]  for the niceties and human interactions you know it um it it serves the int j well which is rich to show  appreciation to others based on merit and not just on the fit with the int j's model so uh some things  you can show appreciation for that are you know that show merit that don't necessarily fit the way you  would have done it but still are good and showing appreciation for that rather than looking at it 
[03:37:30]  saying well hey that isn't the way i would have done it uh will go a long way to you know turning down  the uh volume or the uh temperature in the cauldron called uh vas and bonnie  what if like our podcasts now are like this no no you go ahead what were you gonna say  oh that's wonderful that i think that's a fantastic statement well you know here's also a thing uh  about and and i'm not trying to be nicky negative  but here comes the defensive no no it is why he won't do it no i will try to do it because i got 
[03:38:00]  to go over i got to process this because it was all yeah and he does need to process it and it's not  necessarily being negative it's trying to fit this into his model of how he of how he uh looks at the  world yeah like when you're at my age i am i'm older than you by the way you see things now you know and i mean  you're almost molded throughout life right you know what i'm saying yeah of who you are you're you're 
[03:38:30]  you're you're it's it's like you know your foundation is when you're uh you know adolescent  whatever you know and then you're you're you're built throughout life now in your heart in your heart  whether you're an aggressive person an asshole or whatever and that's not me just in general  you you can't really test and maybe you can but i don't think you can whether a person has a good 
[03:39:00]  heart or not right and that's what it breaks down what we're testing do you know what i'm saying  absolutely and this has nothing to do with huh this has nothing to do with goodness or badness it has  simply only to do with preference and how you deal with the world and your internal uh world as well  so you're right no this doesn't say anything about good or bad you can have serial killers who  are enfps and you can have saints who are enfps you know and that's what i am is an enfp and my wife 
[03:39:30]  is an istj we are exactly the opposite for everything that i am she is exactly the opposite so at least  you guys have three things in common which which very likely is what drew um you know you two guys  to each other in the first place no small talk right we went right to dig that's right  i mean we all saw you guys meet at least it's it seemed like that's where you met on last comic 
[03:40:00]  standing i mean you know it's like watching jody foster grow up from taxi driver to now you know  being a a big star you know it's like we watched your relationship grow from this little sort of  flirtation to now you know what you guys are today and uh you know there's so much good in in your  relationship and you know and and the stuff that causes conflict is because of the way that you guys  process information and how you perceive and interact with the outside world that's all it is 
[03:40:30]  when you realize that hey this is just that you can put a name to it uh then i i think it it should  make things easier for you to uh you know get beyond these things so that you know because my wife and i  look before we we went into this uh we would get mad at each other we wouldn't speak for four days  and then somebody would break the ice and then we'd kind of be okay it'd take us another four or five  days to get better and now we don't do that you know we could we'd still disagree what happened 
[03:41:00]  when i gave rich the silent treatment for a few days he came to me i literally wasn't talking to  him at all and he said we've been getting along real good lately it's very revealing  i mean i feel like i mean the thing that i feel like that is most problematic in from where i am in 
[03:41:30]  the relationship is that i feel like he wants me to be somebody i'm not like if i don't do things  right he's judgmental it's always that's exactly you to me okay well then you can say that later i'm  saying it now but like you know if i i don't pack the way he wants me to pack or you know i don't go  i'm not at the airport the same way or i you know if i forget my phone he loses his mind but yet he can 
[03:42:00]  do it and it's fine i never get mad about that stuff never let me give you an example let me give  you an example you remember when you said bring the headphones down she brought down two sets of  headphones they are completely tangled together like one big knot no one does that you just bring  them down you don't use them you put see the problem is she i just grabbed one and then the other  and they got a little look they're not even tangled well i'm just giving an example the problem is 
[03:42:30]  what does that have to do with him because i'm going to give it a good example you do whatever  and deal with the results later i try to deal with things so the results later don't come back  to haunt me do you see what does that make sense no yeah it does i try to to look at the whole picture  you only look at what's in the moment okay you know and there's nothing wrong with living in the  moment but when you're doing during different situations you got to look at where this is going 
[03:43:00]  to end up what are what are the end results and i i try to look at what are the end results and you  try to go well it is what it is you see what i'm saying and it's a typical judgment versus perception  model and now rich do you ever get bogged down in in details about let's bonnie brought up packing  so there's a way that you think that people should pack and if she doesn't pack do you get bogged down 
[03:43:30]  in the details of that when that happens and you see that that's an issue yeah no here's the thing  yeah you're always telling me how to pack well no here's the thing i go on a roll i know how to pack  where you can get a certain amount if you just stuff a bunch of stuff in your luggage you're not  going to get as much in so i'm trying to help saying look if you fold it this way this way this way  you're going to be able to bring more it's going to be lighter it's going to be easier to travel 
[03:44:00]  okay it's okay so instead of just so i okay i know i look it it sounds dumb i'm a better packer than  her but if she said to me hey when you're writing a script or when she helps me on auditions she tells  me do it this way because she's better at it than me okay now you even though packing is so stupid and  so non uh uh consequential okay uh it's just it's just an example right see what i'm saying so if i 
[03:44:30]  know something that's going to make her life and my life easier and i say it she takes it as  he's trying to control no i'm just trying to make our lives easier so but you can decline  do you understand information like i still i know how i mean look at i've been around a long time i  know how to pack i know what i'm doing you don't get what i'm saying yes i do i'm like i'm saying  that every single time you have to tell me how to pack it's like no i don't i didn't tell you how to 
[03:45:00]  pack the other day i said every time i have my suitcase open you're like you put socks in your shoes  no okay you know you gotta do this you put your things in there and that way it's like always  okay and it is just an example the packing's not like okay here's another thing like it's always  something it's always like it's always something to make our lives easier when we check into a hotel  but dsc it's not making my life easier because you don't understand the effect that you have 
[03:45:30]  on the people around you you don't understand live their lives you don't understand the effect you have  by not caring so i'm just supposed to do whatever you want me to do no we're supposed to go well  what can make each other's life easier i don't want to do this anymore i'm so sorry i am look i hope  everybody understands that i am not a marriage counselor and that's pretty fucking obvious after  this i i think i've i've made things worse rather than making things better lawyer thank you so much 
[03:46:00]  rich if i could let me just throw this out that if let's just take packing i know it's  inconsequential but it is something that is that you guys brought to correct you what did i say  non-consequential but he knew in his head he was like it's inconsequential so he  oh he was doing he was teaching you how to pack i'm sorry non-consequential well see i'm one of  these too so it's almost the same but incorrect it's non-correct okay so intps use your word back 
[03:46:30]  to you the correct way they're using it as a teaching moment don't let him don't let him pull you  he could have used another word that's true you're you're absolutely right and i'm gonna have  he said a little bit of whatever the j means in your thing yeah exactly jackiness  we're really best when we're coming down on a common enemy yes that's how we are we are we are a team 
[03:47:00]  yeah you guys can try to all you people out there can try to divide us but you can't divide barney and  i because we're a team and we're both going up the blue light okay even if i have to hold her and  drop i'm not going up the blue light you're going up the blue light no i don't believe it you believed  in god last week now you know i had a deposition well i'm going to declare victory on that then  on what you guys well you found a way that you can completely agree which is by you know jumping 
[03:47:30]  on a common enemy and just trashing the shit out of them i think it's perfect try someone we really  yes use that use that here's the thing bonnie to me there's no other anybody else i would rather  oh what do you really expect okay you can say in a second like there's a million other girls i like  to fuck but there's nobody else on this planet who has a tipped uterus  who i'd rather be with because she gets it yeah oh god that is the least romantic thing i've ever 
[03:48:00]  heard well INTJs aren't you know my girlfriend gets it that's why i married her they're not  classically romantic in that sense but that was a very loving statement that he just made  barf like you're talking a million other girls yes i don't know i didn't pick a festival level  what were you going to say about the inconsequential uh of uh packing well i was just going to say  that since intps are theoretical and abstract and interested more in ideas when you see that 
[03:48:30]  happening let her pack her own suitcase the way she wants to pack it if it's a if she can't get as  much stuff in there she will have there will be consequences for that when you're on your trip  you know she won't have stuff that she wants and and that will be self-correcting and uh but the thing  is is that it doesn't become inconsequential when you guys then argue about something that is 
[03:49:00]  inconsequential and um you know it that's something that maybe you could work on letting go and just let  her do that stuff the way she wants to do it and and um you do the thing the way you want to do it  and you're you can take pride in the fact that you have the perfectly packed suitcase and she doesn't  have underwear on day three you know well here's here's here's an example another example okay when  we check into a hotel when i check into a hotel room by myself when i go on the road everything is in 
[03:49:30]  in in a certain order i you know like everything is laid out right when she comes in it looks like a  cyclone hit it you know and it's it's like her you know oh everything's here there you know and it's  like it's not comfortable it's just not comfortable and i try you know don't get me wrong she's not a  dirty person she's a clean person right you know but you know what i'm saying is she doesn't care 
[03:50:00]  because he wants to put all his stuff where he puts it and then say all right now you may have this  show all right now you may have this side of the bed like he always is like i get this side of it  like everything else is just like he doesn't want me to take like that's his hotel room right and i'm just  allowed to be there if i could please just keep my shoes where he would like me to keep them that's  how you see it yeah because you always take the thing you always take the what do you call it for 
[03:50:30]  the suitcase the suitcase stand yes because that's yours like everything is you know what you wanted  no i know i don't use but i'm just saying like that's how you view it it's this everything in here  is mine if i want it no and then i'll allow you to have this drawer no and this chair can be yours  but i'm not allowed to put my computer where the computer goes that's where you never built your  computer you've never brought you understand what i'm saying can you not be so literal 
[03:51:00]  INTJs being as yours and then you get mad if i'm on your space but why is it your space  INTJs are skeptical independent and they have high standards of competence and performance for  themselves and others that in itself is not a negative thing but it becomes a problem when  you've got a j and a p trying to share a hotel room together and one it doesn't worry about where 
[03:51:30]  everything is and the other one has to have everything in a certain place but honestly if he  lived with somebody who was like him it would be insane because what if you lived with somebody  who had to have that same side of the bed or like there's no um like so much of it is just like  i i didn't have i i just came in and was like that's fine it's fine everything's fine i like i just  lived the way that rich wanted to live you know it's okay yeah because they were his rules this was set 
[03:52:00]  up for him and then i just tried to fit my life into it yes your life is perfectly involved in it  no but i'm saying like like every all the decor and everything you're right because you're right  it's all you you decided you know that if i went and bought something and put it in you would lose  your mind that's not true right after the fire we went out together and bought stuff and switched  the ride took down so many pictures i'm saying if somebody if you were with somebody who was as um 
[03:52:30]  determined to have their way as you are it would be like you should look at me sometimes that kind of  like what as you want to call it like this like hippie like floozy no loopy way that i am it's at least  you get your way like at least oh you wanted that bathroom you got that bathroom no i didn't want that  bathroom i gave you the good bathroom did i share with my daughter and you get your own bathroom 
[03:53:00]  no you got a tub and a shower i just have a shower whatever girls want tubs oh my god she lays in the  tub i'll take the other bathtub no i will there's no other there's no other i'll take that one i walk  but i just do you understand what i'm saying that i see her laying in there naked like in a way he  doesn't appreciate because i do appreciate the fact that he is the way he is like he does get things  done like you know if there's a doctor's appointment to be made he makes it like he's  that kind of person if if the car needs fixing he gets it fixed or he tells me exactly what day to go 
[03:53:30]  and do it and whatever i do need that in my life i need someone that sort of like if something breaks  in the house you go and fix it right away sometimes a little too quickly you you have to get up from  wherever in the middle of dinner to go to the home depot and get the things and fix but it's fine i accept  that i like that about him i mean i do see that that's good for our relationship responsible that  he's very responsible but then i feel like on the other side of things there's no respect for the 
[03:54:00]  way that i live oh yes there is i think you're very creative i think you're a great great mother  great cook great homemaker great a script script writer she's very creative i see that and i tell  that whenever i do radio if you listen to any radio i always say this is the thing you don't  have to say when you're giving someone a compliment here's where i've said it let me well i'm saying i  have proof that i i do say these things about you that i think you're very creative and smart and funny 
[03:54:30]  you know and whatever i mean i think you're a little frigid but very frigid you know uh  so i'm only kidding everybody knows you're not frigid stop it on the one hand you're calling me a  whore all the time and the next thing you're calling me frigid which is it i'd like to know  well i've never called you a whore once in my life really yeah you've never see this is the thing  if he hasn't exactly used the word okay so i just said i just never i never said you're a whore and 
[03:55:00]  that's that's never been the underlying part of the joke that you've done about me no  that i've had sex with a lot of people no you got i got to the v's that doesn't mean you're a whore  that means that you explore your horror explorer you got these that's an old joke you had  i said i just said you make these jokes  friends of the show
