<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing frustration over the lack of transparency from SiriusXM regarding their listener numbers and comparing their demanding work schedule unfavorably to Howard Stern's. They then transitioned to a discussion of Justin Bieber's declining popularity, referencing Jimmy Norton's apparent eagerness to take a photo with Bieber during a recent Jay Leno appearance (a clip of which was teased).  This led into a promotion of Jim Norton's new comedy special, "Please Be Offended," with a clip showcasing its offensive humor.  Further discussion of Bieber followed, focusing on his perceived lack of masculinity and a comparison to Rachel Maddow. A tangent involved debunking a false social media claim about the "Back to the Future" date and criticizing uninformed opinions on Twitter, specifically regarding Jerry Seinfeld's appearance on Louis C.K.'s show.

Anthony Cumia then dominated a significant portion of the show with detailed accounts of his dating experiences with models. He recounted multiple tumultuous relationships, including a story about a model throwing his phone at his head after discovering compromising text messages.  He shared anecdotes about various women, including Melinda, Jill, and Nicolini, detailing conflicts, physical altercations, and the challenges of maintaining these relationships.  He also discussed his "Live from the Compound" show, contract negotiations, and a potential "Bewitched"-style recasting of a character.

Anthony continued his personal narrative in the next segment, focusing on his romantic relationships, including his nine-year marriage and substantial financial settlement. He detailed his methods of concealing infidelity, using multiple phones and other elaborate tactics. He also mentioned lavish gifts given to various girlfriends, including dentures for his girlfriendâ€™s mother and a Porsche Cayenne for Melinda. A memorable anecdote involved a housewarming party with two girlfriends simultaneously present, leading to one leaving in tears.  He also recounted the theft of items and the burning of a Canadian woman's belongings in his fire pit after she briefly stayed at his home. He shared stories from his previous radio job, including his girlfriend's emotional reaction to moving to New York and his GM witnessing a romantic moment with Melinda. He concluded this segment by discussing his costly divorce and regretting his choice of an inexpensive lawyer.

The broadcast then shifted to a variety of loosely connected topics.  The hosts discussed a trip to Andes, New York, a town allegedly run by celebrities including the "Major Dad" actor and John Travolta's mother.  This was followed by a humorous anecdote about an unpleasant visit to his girlfriend's mother's dilapidated house, resulting in an expensive trailer purchase.  The hosts then launched into highly offensive and vulgar commentary about Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba and Mike Tyson biting Evander Holyfield's ear.  They briefly touched upon the Supreme Court ruling on Obama's healthcare law before engaging in a heated and offensive debate about whether bands like Radiohead and Pearl Jam should play their hit songs in concert. This discussion included listener calls and further offensive commentary.  Detailed analysis of a Pearl Jam setlist and a live performance of "Even Flow" concluded this segment.

The following segment opened with an unidentified woman's voice singing a fragment of a song about finding a better man, before the hosts discussed their Fourth of July plans and Opie's search for a summer rental.  They then mocked a news story about a woman trying to enforce a bikini ban in Asbury Park, requesting and receiving (after initial technical difficulties) an audio clip.  Further discussions included illegally transported clams, restaurant hygiene ratings, the Asbury Park councilwoman, Andy Pettitte's injury, and more technical difficulties with Sam, the sound technician.  An audio clip of a profane bus fight between two older women was played, leading to discussion of cable news ratings and Bill O'Reilly.  Opie's housing search continued, prompting listener calls.  A call from Nicole, a newlywed, detailing a marital dispute prompted discussion on marital dynamics and personal anecdotes.  The show concluded with more technical issues, mentions of Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepsen, the blog "Lonely Virgil," and an upcoming "Pasta Friday."

The final segment included a repeated, distorted, and vulgar rendition of Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe," with lyrics containing sexually aggressive and misogynistic content. The show then transitioned to "After ONA Live."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do this.  Oh, yeah.  Thursday, good morning, everybody.  Hi, people.  How is everybody?  Is that directed at the people in here or at the audience at large?  The millions and millions of people that listen to us on a daily basis.  The millions and millions.  The millions and millions. 
[00:00:30]  They've been working for Satellite Radio for eight years.  Yeah.  I swear to you, I have no idea how many people listen.  The old days, they would give you almost an exact number in every demo.  These assholes, for some reason, they don't want to give you that information.  It is true.  They'd be like, you know, there's 1,332,815 people.  Right.  You'd be like, wow, direct down to the 15 people.  I've heard we've got 2 million listeners.  I've heard we've got 1 million listeners.  That's a big fucking difference.  Because I've heard that we might have less than a million, to be honest. 
[00:01:00]  I have no idea.  I have no fucking clue.  We keep those numbers pretty close to the vest.  Really?  Even for the people doing the show?  Maybe we should know.  They want to do that to keep you down.  Right.  They want to keep every single person around here down.  They never want you to know how well you're doing.  You're doing right.  Because then, God forbid, you ask for a little more money because you're doing so well.  Oh, what the?  I also learned that we're the only radio show broadcasting live next week. 
[00:01:30]  We are amazing.  I also learned Howard Stern started another vacation.  Two and a half weeks this time around.  Lucky man.  I went away in March.  Since March, he's had three vacations.  But these assholes will fucking beat the shit out of us if we ask for a day or two.  Or, God forbid, we're sick.  God forbid we take a sick day.  We're the plow mule.  Holy fuck.  We're the plow mule and the other show's thoroughbreds.  Yeah, you've got to be pampered. 
[00:02:00]  So we'll be here next week for a few days.  That's great.  Yeah.  That's great.  The big 4th of July week.  Falls on a Wednesday.  I'll tell you right now, if we come in here Tuesday, which is the 3rd, and there's no one here,  these people could go fuck themselves.  I'm serious.  Sam doesn't like this already.  I am serious.  You don't like the sound of this already.  If all these guys that are convinced we need to do live shows, if they're not here,  fuck that.  And by the way, I'm not going to be docked any days to do it. 
[00:02:30]  No.  That's what I do now.  Shouldn't be.  It's going to be free days off for me.  Why should we be?  More importantly, though, Justin Bieber is done, Sam.  Your boy is done.  Your boy.  He's not my boy.  Huh?  Apparently he's your boy.  I don't even feel like putting your mic on.  I just want to tell you that your boy, Justin Bieber, is done.  He's not my boy.  We're talking to our big demo today, the Justin Bieber fans.  The Bieber fans.  Didn't Jimmy do a little spot with the Biebs or something? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  He was on Leno probably last night.  Last night?  Yeah, but were they on together?  Did Jimmy meet Justin Bieber?  What's the deal?  Did Jimmy meet Justin Bieber?  I know he wanted to.  Kenny, comment.  I know he desperately wanted a picture with this has-been.  Ah-ha.  This Justin Bieber has-been.  Kenny, comment.  Kenny.  He was on the couch with Mila Kunis.  He was on the couch with Mila Kunis from Ted.  That movie that I will not comment on.  Oh, boy. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, there's no mic.  And they say goodnight.  You know, he was with Jay and Justin Bieber and Mila.  Did he look like he was trying to be close to some of the people?  Who was he standing closest to and looking over at like he was eagerly waiting for a photo?  So, you know, he's hoping, like, all right, I can make a still of this.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, he's thinking, all right, at least I can make a still of this.  So I technically have a picture with Justin Bieber.  You know something?  Because he knows he could grab stills off of the show. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  So he probably sets himself up and poses.  Of course.  For the giant NBC cameras.  And I bet you he was waiting for, you know, Bieber to pose and then he posed.  Yes.  Like it's all natural and shit.  Is that a little Jimmy?  Yeah.  I don't think it's the end of the show, though.  The Tonight Show.  Well, why don't we listen to a clip from Jay Leno with Jimmy North?  I'd like to hear what he did.  I missed it last night.  As that video loads, I just want to tell Sam, I'm sorry, Sam, but your boy Bieber's done.  Oh, I've never been in. 
[00:04:30]  And I keep saying this because he only sold 374,000 copies of his new album.  They were expecting way more.  Oh, they were expecting half a mil.  Yep.  I think they were expecting, yeah, 500,000 right off the bat.  Oh, my God.  I would bet they wanted closer to a million.  Yeah, sure.  And then we did a quick search.  The last artist to do a million in the first week was Taylor Swift in 2010.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's around the same.  Right before that, Lil Wayne did it.  Lil Wayne.  Lil Wayne. 
[00:05:00]  Lil Wayne.  I think Coldplay did it.  Coldplay?  With their last album.  Scissor.  What do you mean their last album?  They've been doing the same exact song for 10 years.  Really?  They just changed the name of it.  Oh, my God.  And I used to be a Coldplay fan.  Coldplay?  They do the exact same song.  Yeah.  They just change it up slightly and throw a name on it, a different name, and everyone  buys into it.  The Biebs?  Where's the Biebs?  It was on...  Where's the Jim Norton?  That's Jim Norton right there. 
[00:05:30]  Where's Jim Norton?  Take control.  Oh, boy.  That's a commercial, Sam.  That's a commercial.  That commercial will end in 13 seconds.  Are you sad that Justin Bieber's done?  No.  Knowing that you're a big fan of his?  Again, I'm not a big fan.  I did download a couple of his early songs.  Oh.  Hence, thus, there.  You're a champion.  You're a champion of his.  I don't think so.  You championed him.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jim.  But I walked up to her before, and I'm like, look, I've never kissed a girl on camera  before.  I'm like, are we supposed to use our tongues?  What do we do?  And she goes, yeah, baby. 
[00:06:00]  We're supposed to be attracted to each other.  So she slides her tongue in my mouth, and we're kissing for a couple of minutes, and  then she takes my hand, and she puts it on her breast, and she goes, go ahead, squeeze  it.  You know you want to.  So we made it after about 20 minutes, and I just squeezed her breast.  I have no punchline.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I was just kind of hoping that you would be happy for me.  And it's hard to believe you're still single, though.  It really is difficult.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I know you told me, what did you have? 
[00:06:30]  I have sleep apnea.  Sleep apnea.  What is that exactly?  Who's on the couch?  What is that?  Oh, that is Mila.  Oh, that is Mila.  That's when you wake up gasping for breath in the middle of the night.  Like, you know, snorers have sleep apnea.  Like, I don't snore, but we've all sat next to somebody.  And it's enragingly if you're on a flight, and you're next to somebody, and they're...  And all you're thinking of is, I'd like to take the fire extinguisher and knock your  teeth down your throat.  But technically, that person is dying in the seat next to you.  That's what's happening.  They're not breathing. 
[00:07:00]  I don't have that happen.  What happens to me is, my throat relaxes, and my tongue kind of collapses on my throat,  which is really frightening that my face has decided to murder me from my sleep.  At least the snoring guy's body is trying to help.  At least the snoring guy's body is going, you know, like, hey, hey.  You know, for some reason, my tongue is like, shh.  It'll be over soon.  And, uh, like a pillow over your face. 
[00:07:30]  Like a pillow over my face.  And so I got the sleep apnea mask, and I have a picture of it, but this is actually what  I have to wear.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How human.  What woman looks at that and says, quick, plug this in so I can mount you?  Who finds that sexually attractive?  Pretty much Hannibal Lecter.  Let me see that again.  Good.  That's a frightening looking picture.  Good heaven.  I just don't understand why my body is trying to kill me.  It's just, it's horrifying.  Maybe my tongue thinks that if I die, he lives on and runs the show. 
[00:08:00]  Well, tell people about the special.  Well, it's on this Saturday on Epix and epixhd.com.  It's called Please Be Offended.  And we could not find a minute of material that was television appropriate.  So we made little promos to promote the special, so I brought one of them instead.  I think you'll enjoy it.  And this, this is not offensive.  This is kind of cute and family-friendly.  In fact, this one, we can't even air.  Well, here, you be the judge.  I am a proud Christian, and I was offended by Jim Norton.  I'm gay, and I was offended by Jim Norton. 
[00:08:30]  I'm black, and I was deeply offended by Jim Norton.  That lily white mother.  Approximately one of the very 10 Americans is offended by Jim Norton.  I'm a Latina, and I was offended by Jim Norton.  Except for what the f*** said about black people, yo.  They all got big f***s.  If you have a man with no idea who the f*** he is, we are citizens against Jim Norton.  And we strongly urge you to boycott Jim Norton's brand new comedy special. 
[00:09:00]  That was a big A.  That was a big A song.  Please be offended.  Only on Epyx.  I'm Jim Norton, and I approve this message.  Thank you, Jim.  Please be offended.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, Stephanie.  I'm on Epyx.  I'm on Epyx.  Jim, thank you, buddy.  There you go.  Right on for Jim Norton.  That's great.  But we want to know about the Biebs.  Yeah, he met the Biebs.  I'm sure he met the Biebs.  I don't know.  He's not going to f*** him.  He would have tweeted if he met the Biebs.  He really would have.  He would have tweeted pictures and everything. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, look at that.  Oh, there's a little picture with Mila Kunis.  Mila Kunis.  Look, they're making look like eyes at each other.  Wow.  Wow.  Did she get an ass implant or something?  I don't know.  She looks like she has an ass again.  Something happened.  I don't know why I said again.  But, yeah, she looks like she has an ass.  Yeah.  She had a very, very small flat one.  She had nothing going on there.  No, no.  She's beautiful.  Oh, there's the picture at the end.  So, you got Biebs.  Then you got Leno. 
[00:10:00]  Then you got Jim Norton.  Then you got Mila Kunis.  Yeah, him and Mila kind of standing next to each other.  Jim almost being completely obscured by Jay Leno.  By Jay's left shoulder.  And Jay obviously wanting to be right next to Justin Bieber.  Yeah, I don't think Jimmy will be happy with this picture.  Because it has to be perfect.  This isn't...  What's Bieber doing with the denim vest on?  He's being cool.  It's not quite this spaceman outfit that he usually wears when he's grabbing his dick  and singing songs no one wants to hear. 
[00:10:30]  He's trying to look more like a man.  Yeah, it's his adult look.  He's not wearing the purple hoodies anymore.  Is he trying to rip off Bruce?  He's...  The denim?  He's trying everything, man.  He really is.  His hormones are not taking over.  This kid is still very feminine.  How old is he now?  He's like 19.  Oh, God.  Far too old to be this feminine.  Far too old to be this feminine.  If he...  He looks like Rachel Maddow.  I was going to say, yeah.  If he looks like this next year, MSNBC.  He's going to be hosting a show.  Yep. 
[00:11:00]  That androgynous fucking network.  I think he might be androgynous.  They just don't want to talk about it yet.  He is kind of...  He's over, though.  Femi.  Sorry, Sam.  I'm okay with it.  I mean, I don't think he's terribly talented as it is.  You know, there were thousands of people outside of the Today Show, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Good for them.  If only each one of them had bought an album, he'd probably be in better shape.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, this is a letdown for the Bieber people, right?  Yeah, I would say even in 2012, that's a low number for Justin Bieber. 
[00:11:30]  It should be at least a half million.  You would think.  He's at least 200,000 behind where they wanted him to be.  Especially for the amount of press he did for it.  Fuck yeah.  He was everywhere.  He was in here, for God's sakes.  In this room?  Not in this room.  Was I sleeping?  Why couldn't you get him for the after show?  No.  Did they call it?  No?  I couldn't get him for the after show.  That would have been great.  I'd have called in on my way home.  Hey, Justin Bieber.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, you fucking fruit.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Yeah, something.  It would have gone like that.  You'd have been all embarrassed. 
[00:12:00]  No, but Sam doesn't get embarrassed.  That's what sucks.  He'd have laughed like he was embarrassed, but really thought it was funny.  Kind of into it, though, right?  I liked yesterday on the after show talking about the weight of guns.  People kept calling up to correct other people.  And it was a prime example of how callers will call to bash the previous caller and call  them an idiot because they have no clue what they're talking about.  What, the karaoke gun that was 200 pounds?  Yeah.  Went from 200 pounds to 30 pounds.  No, it's way more than 30.  To 83.  83 pounds. 
[00:12:30]  Fully loaded.  Then they said, you can mount it on a tank.  Right.  Then they said, no, you mount another one on a tank.  Literally for the entire hour, people were calling in, correcting each other.  That's right.  And they were like, oh, thank goodness, another call.  So what did you decide in the end as the host?  Ant was holding a tank while he was singing Kaya.  Yes, literally a tank.  I'm very strong.  And that's much different than what the homies do.  Yes, much different.  Yes, that was another thing.  I was taking a lot of criticism from people saying that I was exactly like the homeboys  in some of those World Star Hip Hop videos because I had my guns in the A-A like I just 
[00:13:00]  did in K-A.  Sure.  And I was singing and flaunting violence.  I'm going to get time with it.  Please.  Please.  I was making it rain.  Have I ever made it rain?  I don't think I have.  I don't think so.  I don't think I have.  We made it rain outside Letterman a little bit, but that was more of a goof.  We're being goofy.  All right.  Just throwing a little money in the air.  Yeah, that was.  So we kind of made it rain.  I got to make it rain.  I'm going to make a video where I make it rain. 
[00:13:30]  Just throw like money down on, I don't know, Bobo or something.  I also want to make a video where I just do something very ordinary.  Like go into a deli and order a sandwich.  And as the guy's making it, just look at it.  Like video the whole thing.  Me asking for the sandwich.  And then as he's making it, just turn the camera to my face and go,  World Star Hip Hop, yeah!  Oh man, making a sandwich!  Yeah, motherfucker!  That would be a good idea.  Like just, because, you know, who cares? 
[00:14:00]  Normal white folk things.  White people things.  But I'm so excited that it's going to be on World Star Hip Hop, yo.  World Star Hip Hop.  World Star Hip Hop rules.  It's the greatest.  It rules.  Oh!  You know, people are just assholes all the time.  I read in the paper that Louis C.K., the premiere, starts tonight at 1030 on FX, right?  Yes.  And we learned more about this season.  We learned that Robin Williams is going to be on.  Yeah.  Parker Posey, which we said on this very radio show. 
[00:14:30]  And then the article says, it's just a tiny little article that's kind of buried in our papers,  that Jerry Seinfeld is going to be doing three episodes.  So I went and tweeted, holy shit, Jerry Seinfeld's doing three episodes on Louis C.K.  And I'm getting beat up for fucking tweeting it.  Louis's getting beat up for having them.  Why?  What?  Because people are assholes.  They're like, Jerry Seinfeld's so overrated.  Can you please tell me which episodes he's going to be on so I don't watch? 
[00:15:00]  Without even knowing in what capacity he's going to be on.  Thank you!  Because if you know anything about Louis C.K., he doesn't just do what anyone else would do.  It's not Fantasy Island or the love vote where he's having people come on.  Right.  So then I tweeted just to help Louis out a little bit.  Like, no, you fuck.  I didn't write no, you fucking assholes.  I'm saying it now.  I would have.  That basically Louis is using him in a way that is very unexpected and unlike anything Jerry Seinfeld has done.  And that's exactly what I read into it when I read the article. 
[00:15:30]  I'm like, wow, if Louis C.K. got Seinfeld for three episodes, he's going to have him in such a way where you're going to be blown away.  Yes.  But these close-minded dicks that think they have any type of voice out there, it drives me nuts.  Twitter has really made us a bit crazy about things because it really does give people an open forum to just express how stupid they are.  But then you sit there and go, do you, A, understand our radio show? 
[00:16:00]  B, do you understand Louis C.K. at all?  Before you even think about what you tweet.  Yeah.  He's not going to have the fun-loving, goofy, fucking sitcom Jerry Seinfeld, you idiot.  Yeah.  Elaine!  There's going to be none of that.  Idiots, I should say.  Yeah.  I don't know how he's using them, but the people that have seen the episode say, wow, you're going to be kind of surprised how he uses Jerry Seinfeld.  It's very different.  And that's what Louis does.  When they did the reunion episode on Curb, that wasn't Jerry from Seinfeld. 
[00:16:30]  It was Jerry Seinfeld doing Jerry from Seinfeld, but it was done very well.  It wasn't just like the goofy Jerry.  And I like Jerry Seinfeld on Curb Your Enthusiasm.  That was a great bunch of episodes.  I wasn't a huge fan of Seinfeld when it was out.  I'm a huge fan.  No, I know you are.  I was doing radio, so I kind of missed the boat in general on that.  I'm not a huge fan of his stand-up.  I think there's a shitload of guys that are way better on a stage than Jerry Seinfeld. 
[00:17:00]  A shitload.  So I agree with that point.  But, I mean, you know, Louis knows what the fuck he's doing with his TV show.  Yes, he does.  And if he got Jerry Seinfeld, really, you're going to blow off those three episodes?  You're going to miss out.  You're stupid.  What an idiot.  It's just frustrating.  Yeah, please.  Why would you assume, like, the obvious all the time?  Especially with someone...  Huh?  When you assume, you know what happens? 
[00:17:30]  Make an ass out of you and me.  See, because it's spelt that way.  Oh, shit.  Yes.  Oh, shit.  So you learned something.  Wow.  Assume-y.  It just shows you don't know anything about Louis C.K.  No.  I guess this is my point.  Also on Twitter, last night and yesterday, I have to address this.  I don't know how we missed it.  Travis did not put it on the show prep.  Fired.  So fired.  Nobody caught it.  But do you realize yesterday was the day in Back to the Future 2 that Doc Brown and Marty McFly went into the future? 
[00:18:00]  It was, as everybody knows, June 27th, 2012.  That was yesterday.  It was when everybody...  Yeah, when they went into the future.  And everybody posted the picture of the panel in the DeLorean showing that that was indeed the date that everybody... 
[00:18:30]  There it is.  There it is.  ...went into the...  You are a bunch of stupid motherfuckers.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Because, first of all, it's not the date.  It wasn't.  It's a hoax again that everyone felt for.  It started trending.  What do you mean?  Someone just put a different date on?  They just photoshopped.  And they photoshopped badly because, if you look, the two for 2012, the first two, doesn't even line up with the numbers on the LCD or whatever it is. 
[00:19:00]  If I gave a shit about this Back to the Future shit, I would have bought that that looked like the date.  Right.  But I don't give a shit.  And everybody knows it's 30 years into the future, which would make it 2015.  So we've got three years to go.  We have three more years to go, but boy, did I just keep getting fucking tweet after tweet after tweet about it. 
[00:19:30]  So I realized that it wasn't the only movie that showed that.  Look at that.  It's actually Die Hard 2.  Wow.  Did you know he was holding a sandwich board in Harlem that said, I hate June 27, 2012.  Oh, that's what that sign said.  That's right there.  Because they've blurred it out over the years.  Yes.  If you look down, there's another one.  Of course, whoever made that one screwed up.  It's June 21, but it's June 27, 2012, the Kennedy assassination.  With Jackie O. trying to get some brain. 
[00:20:00]  This one, of course, the icy North Atlantic, June 27, 2012.  The Titanic slips beneath the surly bonds of...  I don't remember that text even being on the screen.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was it, though.  The North Atlantic.  And it's in genuine old-timey text.  Nice.  So it had to happen.  That, the Hindenburg, of course, Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Oh, look, it's June 27, 2012.  The world ends.  Oh, the movie, June 27, 2012.  June 27, 2012.  Remember that movie?  Yes.  We were warned, it says. 
[00:20:30]  That was yesterday.  So why are we here today?  I'm confused.  Much like...  I'm very confused.  Yes.  Much like Back to the Future, where Doc and Marty propelled themselves.  That's a little pretentious art.  Which, by the way, do you want to pawn it or sell it?  Because I have to frame this.  It's going to stay in my shot.  Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Wow.  June 27, 2012.  The Hindenburg exploded.  A lot happened yesterday.  Yes.  Everyone remembers that.  By the way, CokeLogic has a great tweet here. 
[00:21:00]  Sam, do you regret getting your Justin Bieber name tattooed on your arm now that he's done?  Oh.  Now that he's finished.  What are you going to do with that arm tattoo?  Believe it or not, that's a common misconception.  You have Justin Bieber tattooed on your arm.  That's incorrect.  Now...  You showed us.  Yeah.  I remember you did take a picture of him by the SiriusXM board in the front when he was here.  Do you have a picture with the Biebs?  No, I wish I did.  No, he does.  Oh.  He tweeted that.  I thought you did, and he signed your arm.  And you got a tattoo. 
[00:21:30]  And then you had a tattoo.  You guys are confusing Justin Bieber with Jack White.  And that happens from time to time, I guess.  No.  We would never confuse the two.  Yeah.  No, it was Jack White who was here that I did those things with.  What can we change your tattoo into?  We're going to go ahead and say nothing.  Knife wounds?  I mean, I guess you theoretically could cut the tattoo off with a knife.  What about Jack Black?  Have you cut the white part off and just...  Make it black?  That's weird, right?  Yeah.  Although I wouldn't have flesh because you would cut it off.  Yeah.  We could do a skin graft, and then you could tattoo over it. 
[00:22:00]  Like a patch.  Like a quilt.  I'd probably be pissed at you guys, though, and wouldn't get the black part tattooed on.  We could get HootKid to brand you.  Put a nice branding over the whole area.  Does HootKid brand people?  Well, black people do.  Oh.  Because the tattoos don't show up as well.  So they brand each other.  For the most part.  HootKid, by the way, is hilarious.  He's grown on me.  He's just...  He's funny.  What?  What's that?  What?  What?  Huh?  People haven't figured out yet that he just talks shit all the time.  All the time.  He's just making shit up constantly. 
[00:22:30]  What a shit talker.  It's a great fucking gig.  And he's just like, what?  What's...  Like people talk, you can't believe what you're saying.  Right.  He did?  What's that?  Huh?  I saw him on the sidewalk, and he goes, what's up?  Oh, and I go, I'm just living the thug life.  Is that what you said?  He just laughed at me.  He loves calling people niggas.  He just laughed at me like I'm a silly white boy.  He calls people niggas all the time.  Does he go all in with the ER?  No, no, no, no, no.  Why not?  He could do that.  He's a nigga.  But he's calling our interns the N-word.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but that's easy. 
[00:23:00]  We could do that, too.  He's got to go with the ER.  Tell him he's got to go ER, or it's not allowed on the show.  Next time he's on the show, I'll mention to him that he should really step it up.  Just because he's allowed to.  Yeah.  You know, I guess society has told us that certain people are allowed to.  Soci-o-ty.  We're not allowed to.  You're not allowed to.  Soci-o-ty.  Right.  But he was describing those thugging and bugging videos as being ignorant.  Ignat.  Yes, he was saying they were ignorant.  Of course they are.  Made black people look very bad.  I think, to quote who, Katie, pointed at the screen and said, them some niggas. 
[00:23:30]  Yes, he did say them some niggas.  Yeah.  But he went AS again.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's not, nope.  I don't think he was appreciating it.  Ban him from the show until he says it properly.  Yeah.  Please.  He didn't like it.  Of course that's just a small fucking section of what those people do.  Is it?  I completely believe that, yes.  Look, you know, I haven't really seen any numbers.  I completely believe that, yes, sir.  Do you know, I was... 
[00:24:00]  They do a world of hurt, but it's a small percentage.  I was trolling a lot of websites yesterday.  And, of course, I look at many websites, some of the new Black Panther movement websites.  But then I also go to other ones, like, there's a website called, can you believe this, niggermania.com.  What?  Yes.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  And, by the way, they were commenting on this very show on that website.  God damn it.  And I was reading some of the posts. 
[00:24:30]  Who was?  Who was commenting about the show?  Just some of the people on the site, on the message boards, on the forums of that website.  And do you realize, after my rant about being called a racist and that white guilt public service announcement thing,  do you realize that they said I wasn't strong enough about what I said?  Really?  Yes!  They're going to have to try harder.  I've got to step up my racism? 
[00:25:00]  You've got to step it up.  I don't get it.  I thought I was really making strides in racism here.  And, apparently, Sam's reading some of the topics and just laughing his ass off.  Can you read some of the topics, Sam?  They shouldn't be discussing you or this show on this board.  I hope they understand we're individuals that think very differently.  Leave me out of this shit, please.  Look, it's part of what is going on in this nation.  Well, that's all we got.  And you have to look at everything.  You have to look at every opinion, websites. 
[00:25:30]  Believe me, I look at many, many black separatist websites.  And I look at white separatist websites.  Yeah, but you look at the white separatist websites to find people who share your point of view and the black ones.  Now, Sam, you're being very presumptuous there.  Bravo, Sam.  Bravo.  I look at this because I want to know what's happening as far as how people feel on all sides. 
[00:26:00]  Oh.  And that's what I do.  What are some of the topics they're discussing?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Let's see.  There's this one, the congressional.  Just go.  Congressional Coon Caucus ready to walk to save Holder's ass.  I guess they're talking about the contempt vote that's coming today.  I just don't think that that's what the caucus is called. 
[00:26:30]  You don't think?  I'm almost positive.  Oh, this is a good hypothetical.  All right, let's see.  Why were they?  What if there were niggers on Gilligan's Island?  They're discussing that.  That's a fantasy kind of thread, I believe they have.  A fantasy thread.  What about the farting one above that?  Oh, sure.  Nigger pulls gun on neighbor for farting.  Now, I don't remember hearing that in the initial story. 
[00:27:00]  I did hear a gentleman pulled a gun on a neighbor because he was farting.  I heard it on 1010 Wins.  But, you know, on this website, you will get people that will elaborate on the titles of stories.  Editorialize a little.  Thus, yeah, editorializing just a tad.  But, yeah, they said I wasn't â€“ they said I was saying that there's â€“ discussing solutions, solutions to the problem that I was talking about on the show the other day. 
[00:27:30]  When their take is there is no solution because it's just genetics.  Which you probably believe, actually.  Do you believe that?  Inferior or something.  Do you believe that?  What?  I'm asking.  Do you believe that?  Oh, B, that's preposterous to even ask a question like that.  All right.  I'm not even going to give â€“  You so answered that question.  No, no, I'm not even going to give that question the dignity of an answer. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  Dignity of an answer?  Don't dignify it.  Right.  I'm not dignifying it with a response.  All right.  Because that's crazy.  You're all about solutions.  I am about commentary on society.  You're putting words in my mouth?  No.  All right.  I'm about.  Look, I'm just stating, you know, people should realize that there are sites like this 
[00:28:30]  out there.  Yeah.  People should realize also that there are sites on the other end of the spectrum.  You go to the new Black Panther site, and believe you me, you're going to see some hatred  against white people and threats of death.  Do you realize some of these Black Panthers, and I was on their site looking, said that white  people should absolutely be killed.  All white people should be killed.  Then, no, listen to this.  Buried.  Buried.  Dug up. 
[00:29:00]  Killed again.  No.  Buried.  Dug up.  And killed again.  Literally, that's what they were saying on the new Black Panther site.  I would hate that.  There's a lot of hatred in this world, and I need to see it.  Why?  I am fueled by hate.  Why?  I'm fueled by hate.  I think it takes up a lot of your time.  It really does.  I'm so glad you're admitting it.  I thought there's going to be an unsoable.  I understand this shit's going on out there, but it seems like it just takes up so much 
[00:29:30]  of your time.  Let me look at my iPhone calendar.  Hold on.  Tomorrow.  Look.  Hate.  I have hate penciled in.  Hate penciled in?  From 10 to 2.30, I am supposed to hate.  Then I take a little break to just hang up by the pool.  And chill out with your helicopter.  Well, yeah, but immediately.  That's only for an hour, because then I have to start tweeting more hatred.  All right.  I really am full of hate. 
[00:30:00]  This is your hobby?  Hate is a hobby of mine.  I hate as a hobby.  But I just, I garner hate from all angles.  See, people think I'm an equal opportunity hater.  I love looking at people's hate, no matter who they hate.  I want to know what name you use on this website.  Message board, I should say.  I'm not registered.  Come on.  Come on. 
[00:30:30]  No, you're just looking.  Come on.  I just shop.  I just shop around and look.  Maybe the people could come up with a name for us.  Oh, boy.  What do you use on this website?  I don't, I honestly.  Come on.  I read, but I haven't posted.  Come on.  Do you have a username on the new Black Panthers website?  No, that either.  I don't.  What's your username?  We need to know.  Come on.  I really don't.  Come on.  I don't, I am in a, let me be honest with you. 
[00:31:00]  You're just an observer?  I am in a line of work where it would be detrimental to my career.  Now, some of these people on the website might, might say, hey, why don't you, you know, put  your money where your, your mouth is, put your racism where your mouth is and, and register  and log in.  Well, I think I could do more good here as a broadcaster and expose hatred on all levels. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, okay.  All levels.  When are we going to start doing that?  I all, I do all the time.  You do.  I expose hatred, uh, on all levels.  All levels.  I could, I believe I could do more good that way.  All right.  Then, uh, you know, putting, uh, my job in jeopardy.  Uh, so I, I observe, I'm an observer and then I spout off here on these very airwaves.  Ah.  But, um, I was a little taken aback that, uh, they didn't think my hatred was quite strong 
[00:32:00]  enough.  You'll take care of that.  I'll take care of that.  You'll make them proud.  I just want to know what your username is.  I, I ain't buying it for a second.  I honestly don't have one.  I honestly don't.  I would tell you if I did.  But, um, again, uh, I don't have to post.  Uh, I, I speak here and people post for me that I have to step up my hatred just a little  more.  I'm not really giving it my all. 
[00:32:30]  I'm on eight.  I could be ten.  Are you happy they talk about you on that site?  I'm happy they talk about me on any site.  Opie, uh, any press is good press, they say.  Yeah, that's right.  And, uh, whether it's the National Socialist Movement, uh, or, uh, uh, nigger mania.  You should send links to the bosses here.  Just want to let you know, getting some word about the show out there.  Hey!  Oh my God.  You might want to, uh, you know, might want to put this out there.  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Papa Cracker, is that your username?  They're coming in now.  It's not Papa Cracker. 
[00:33:00]  You don't use Papa Cracker?  No.  No.  Not that.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, no.  Mm-hmm.  I'm trying to see if, uh, people.  Mm-hmm.  No.  They're coming in.  You're just a window shopper.  I just, you know what?  Like I said, I look at all the sites.  Yeah.  I go to Stormfront.  I look at them.  And, uh, they're a little different because, um, they also add in their hatred of the Jews.  So, that kind of overshadows their hatred of black people.  Um, but, uh. 
[00:33:30]  You used to discuss this stuff with, uh, Live from the Compound.  What's going on with that?  Uh, well.  People are wondering what's going on with Live from the Compound.  Well, with, uh, us deep in, uh, contract negotiations.  Deep.  No one has even gotten back to us.  I decided to not give them any excuses.  That's the beauty of this company.  You actually put an offer in, and they, they, they, uh, whatever.  Yeah.  But, uh.  Whatever.  Do what you gotta do.  I don't give a fuck.  I've decided to just kind of hang back a little.  But I might, I might pop on.  You should pop on.  On the weekend. 
[00:34:00]  And, uh, do a whole, whole thing.  I gotta get new graphics and opening together, though.  Mm-hmm.  Because, as you know, somebody else was sharing the spotlight on Live from the Compound for a while.  It's being recast for the new season.  It's being recast.  Recast.  You're bringing in a new, uh, Darren Stevens.  I am gonna do exactly what they did on Bewitched.  I want a new Darren Stevens.  Without telling anybody?  Yes.  That you changed Darren Stevens?  So I'm looking for another vindictive model that I can do.  Vindictive?  Woo.  With the same, you gotta use the same name, though.  Exactly. 
[00:34:30]  Exactly.  That went bad.  Uh, yeah.  Kind of went bad.  Yeah.  Actually, I finally got a car out of my driveway yesterday.  Jesus Christ.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Finally, yesterday.  All the shit was packed up, and it's like, all right, get it on a car carrier and take  it to the fucking left coast.  Yeah.  That's what I say.  You know, apparently she's, uh, because of that whole, uh, uh, on the airplane thing,  where she was, uh, uh, saying that a certain actor was, um, trying to pick her up and was 
[00:35:00]  drinking and everything like that.  Took his, uh, wedding off or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  But because of that, uh, she went from, like, 15,000 followers to 30,000 followers on Twitter.  And, um, a couple of people took notice.  And, uh, uh, I guess the guy that, um, that wrote, uh, or was in charge of produced or something,  Juno, is asking about, uh, her doing a writing gig and a book.  Damn.  And now she's got another agent for commercial work and, and TV work and stuff.  Oh, my God.  So, wing out to the, uh, to that coast. 
[00:35:30]  But, you know, I guess if she had to get three followers to start with, there probably wouldn't  be 30,000, but there were 15,000 because, you know.  You're a bit bitter.  Nah, I don't give a shit to tell you the truth.  No.  She's going to have to send you checks for the next few years.  Fucking A.  Half yours.  Oh, that's right.  I don't think I'm seeing that.  I think I finally got my apartment back today.  Jesus.  So you come out a winner.  I come out a winner.  I get exactly what I had.  And that's not bad this time around.  Yeah, really, right?  You did well this time. 
[00:36:00]  Holy smokes.  How many have we been through?  I don't even fucking know.  I don't know either.  This has got to fucking end.  That whole thing with the fucking apartment.  I do try to say hi to your girls, but I just know they always just end awful.  That's terrible.  Jesus.  Not always.  Not always.  Not always.  I'm sorry.  This time it's going to be good.  It's like she's fucking on the chopping block sitting there.  Sorry.  The executioner's fucking hatchet.  I don't know. 
[00:36:30]  I don't know.  I don't know the...  I don't know.  No one does.  I don't know.  All right.  We live in the present.  I apologize.  I have a very personal life.  Yeah, sure.  I don't know.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I have...  You know.  All right.  That's okay.  I'm sure it'll be great.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I'm sorry.  Now I look like an idiot.  We're living in the...  How uncomfortable.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm good.  I'm good.  It's fine.  It's fine.  I do try to just say hi to all of them.  They're great.  Everyone understands.  They all be good.  I can't believe that Twitter can actually end up getting you paid in jobs and things like 
[00:37:00]  that.  Oh, it's amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  Could get you paying gigs.  I get 30,000 followers.  Nobody wants me to do anything.  Yeah.  Who was your favorite, though?  Was it Nicolini?  Wow.  You want me to rate him?  Was it Haber?  Which one was Haber?  Melinda?  Haber was cool after the fact.  Yeah.  Haber's cool.  Yeah.  A little batshit, though.  Yeah.  They're all a little batshit.  They are.  Well, you got to type.  Who was it?  Fucking... 
[00:37:30]  What do you think?  Well, I didn't know a lot of them that well.  Was it Jennifer?  Oh, boy.  The ex-wife?  What was that?  Who made me do a sit-down with her because we weren't getting along?  Who was it?  The Cleveland girl?  Was it the Cleveland girl that wore the fucking...  Oh, yeah.  The dress and the fucking Doc Martens?  Remember her?  Oh, yeah.  Was she the one that thought she was moving in and...  Oh, yeah.  Was doing the furniture shopping with her mom?  Yeah.  She said that her and her mom should fly to New York and decorate my house. 
[00:38:00]  Was she the one that called and said, I hope you don't mind, but I'm in your driveway?  Yes.  No!  She drove from Cleveland...  She was kind of hot, though.  ...to my driveway to give me grief.  Was there a Cherry Darts girl in there, too?  That was her.  Yeah, yeah.  No, there was a couple Cherry Darts girls then?  No, it was her and her sister.  No, there was another one.  Was there another one?  Uh-huh.  Used to...  That was crazy.  Let me see.  Oh, let me think. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  I don't remember that one.  You don't remember that one?  I love kind of living vicariously through you.  Just the little details that get picked up.  It was...  That's awesome.  It was...  There was a time right after Melinda because that was...  That was, like, the last real long-termer I had.  Tell us how many years.  Eight.  Like, nine.  Nine.  Damn.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  And that was when you were doing, like, nice couple things and going 
[00:39:00]  to renaissance fairs and, like...  With Eastside Dave.  Yeah.  Which, if you don't go to a renaissance fair with Eastside Dave, you're  missing out on life's wondrous moments.  Yeah, yeah.  Doing all that.  But then...  Then that, you know...  So are you taken or single right now?  What?  Oh, my God.  You see, of course, I'm...  What?  I have a lovely lady here in the studio, Opie. 
[00:39:30]  Of course.  Come on.  Of course.  Anthony's heart is given to another.  Oh, my God.  Be nice.  I'm being nice.  What?  Welcome aboard.  Welcome aboard.  Enjoy the ride.  It might get a little...  Enjoy the ride?  Holy shit.  I'll have an open...  I'll have an open mind.  Wow.  I'll do that for you, sir.  Yeah.  I'm going to have an open mind about this one.  Thank you.  All right.  I think this is...  It's fair enough, right?  That's very kind of you.  Okay. 
[00:40:00]  I think this is the one.  Yeah, see?  That's what I think.  I'm going to have an open mind.  This will be great.  Jeez, Louise.  Who's Louise?  Make sure you have your seatbelt on at all times.  Keep your hands and feet inside the car.  No flash photography.  Are you tall enough to...  Are you tall enough to...  Ride this ride.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  No, it'll be good.  Do you like the stories in hindsight?  You probably don't like them as they're happening. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, any stories with the other one?  As they're happening.  Or the last one, I should say.  Or do you...  Now that you're like...  There's stories.  Now that you're free and clear, is things good?  Well...  Was it just a basic breakup?  Was there some big incident?  What happened?  I'm only bringing this up because you brought it up.  I know.  Yeah, no, no.  I'm just trying to think.  It's really...  It just kind of fizzled.  It was a fizzly relationship.  It fizzled?  Really?  Yeah. 
[00:41:00]  But she was a model.  Yeah.  You know something?  There's just...  It's a big get for people.  Ah.  To have a model.  Ah.  Yeah.  Unless you could fucking have a little chit-chat.  No chit-chatting.  Yeah, not quite, you know...  You need a chit-chat.  Nothing really...  No real, you know, spark there.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  How long did that last?  I don't know.  A year?  How long?  Two years?  I don't know.  She was a Snoopy one, too. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, what is it?  Boy, did she fucking teach me a thing or two.  That was like training.  You had to learn new tricks?  Oh, my God.  I learned that my security was down.  I didn't keep my shields up.  You needed to bulk up your security.  I didn't keep my shields up.  I was like fucking Kirk in the Wrath of Khan.  One big happy family.  One big happy fleet.  What kind of Snoopin'?  I think all women Snoop, though.  This is damn peculiar.  I was looking like I didn't raise my shields.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  And boy, did she attack.  She hit me with fucking phasers.  I believe all women will Snoop a bit.  Dude.  I really believe that.  This wasn't Snooping.  She fucking went deep.  Undercover.  This was crazy stuff.  She looked at everything.  She looked at my Twitter direct messages.  How did she do that?  Because I neglected to close my Twitter sometimes.  Right.  She looked at my phone.  How was the DMs?  Were they some brutal ones?  Sometimes.  They could get a little fun.  Yeah.  You know.  What are you going to do? 
[00:42:30]  Just talking.  Just tacking, tacking, tacking.  Yeah.  Just a little yapping.  My emails.  She got into those.  How'd she get into your emails?  You just leave everything open at your house?  My phone was unlocked.  Nice.  And constantly signed into my email.  Wow.  And my texts were all out there in the open.  Because I was from the school of thought that no one was going to pick my phone up and  just start going through it.  Maybe she was.  She was from the school of thought that you weren't talking to other girls. 
[00:43:00]  Exactly.  Yeah.  They kind of assumed that.  Especially at first.  I didn't have...  But she's suspicious of something.  I think right from the start there wasn't a real close bond thingy.  No.  Because I do believe we may have been going out for a couple of months and you might remember  a small concert, Paul McCartney at the Apollo Theater.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Did she go with you?  No.  Oh, I thought that was her.  No.  No.  Oh, I thought that was her.  Wait, you were already going out with her when you had the other one there?  Well, she believed we were going out already.  And who was the other girl?  That was Lexi.  I didn't say hi to that one.  I apologize.  That was Lexi.  And...  If she's listening, I apologize.  And what a faux pas.  I get very confused who I'm supposed to say hi to.  What a faux pas if I try to cover that one up because Getty Images took a photo of us 
[00:44:00]  outside the Apollo Theater.  You don't need to always get the attention, especially in that situation.  What's wrong with you?  Well, I was told my game sucked.  Because the paparazzi got you.  Because I was exposed by the paparazzi.  So, yeah, but she continued after that.  How did you explain your way out of that?  Yes.  That you got photographed with another woman while you were supposedly dating the model.  I believe I said I had a ticket.  And last minute gave it away to somebody. 
[00:44:30]  And they just walked in with you?  Yeah.  Did you believe that?  I guess models are dumb.  And it turns out this Lexi chick had a boyfriend, so we were both in a bit of Dutch.  Is she a fan of the show?  I don't know.  I haven't spoken with her.  And since her boyfriend said, Anthony, I can't compete with that.  Could you please leave my girlfriend?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So I backed right off.  But you guys continued after that.  Who, Lexi?  No, you and the model.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:45:00]  How'd you really explain?  We did.  Until...  How'd you explain your way out of that for real?  I did.  I just said, it's a McCartney concert.  I got two tickets.  I just took somebody.  Because, what, she was on the left coast still?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do think she had to go out to California or something.  Okay.  I'm trying to remember this.  I think my wife would understand that.  Yeah.  You think your wife would understand that?  I can say that now, Sam.  You've got a wife.  My wife would be cool with it.  She'd be cool with that, right?  Paul McCartney, I'm just going to go in with another girl because you're busy.  It's McCartney.  I'm out of town. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Good thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Something like that.  All right.  Then, I remember being in a hotel room with the said model.  And this was...  I guess she looked at my phone.  Now, this was pretty early on.  And I don't remember seeing her mad, go crazy, or anything.  This is the first time I ever saw her go crazy.  I'm in the bathroom.  I had just gotten out of the shower.  I'm in a towel.  And I'm doing my toiletries. 
[00:46:00]  No, no.  How was the hog?  It was a little cold.  Could you see it through the towel?  No, no, no.  All right.  No.  And I do recall her walking in with an angry look on her face.  I've never seen this face before.  Holding my phone and shaking it at me.  Oh, boy.  And then heaving it at my head.  Oh, boy.  Did he catch it?  You motherfucker.  Nice.  And all I'm thinking is, holy shit, what did I do?  Right.  No, you were thinking, what did she say?  No, because I didn't know what the fuck...  I didn't think anyone was going to pick my phone up. 
[00:46:30]  Right.  Did he catch the phone?  I know how much you like your iPhone.  No, it smashed off my head and flew into the mirror.  Head?  It hit you?  Yeah.  You didn't throw your reflexes out of the way?  No, I couldn't, George Bush, because I wasn't expecting it at all.  You got to do the...  I wasn't expecting it at the roadside.  The ex-president did.  You know, just hanging out.  So it bounced off your skull?  Bounced off my head, hit the mirror, and cracked the screen of my iPhone.  Wow.  I remember that cracked iPhone.  Now I know why it happened.  See?  I'm getting answers today.  I was a battered boyfriend.  She did hit me occasionally.  She did? 
[00:47:00]  She did punch me occasionally.  That's not right.  In the face?  No, I was always in the chest or stomach or arms.  You shouldn't have to put up with that.  But I think she was going for the face a few times, but I bobbed and weaved.  Nice.  I was bobbing and weaving.  Yeah, yeah.  My wife is so dumb.  This is not me talking, by the way.  It's Fuckball Johnson.  She thinks porn spam is real chicks.  Oh, it's bad.  Emails?  No.  Well, they're starting to get a little, you know, there's some trickery now. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  We've all been guilty of being on a porn site and some chick is talking to you from a chat  room somewhere.  You're like, what the fuck is this?  And it's like a pre-recorded chat room thing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's always a pop behind, too.  It's behind the browser.  You don't even know where it is.  She's like, hi.  You just got here.  Oh, what are you doing?  Yeah, no.  I'm just going to take my panties off.  What the fuck?  Wait a minute.  My wife's nursing my kid and I'm trying to fucking close windows.  Like, what the fuck is this?  Yeah, tell me what you want. 
[00:48:00]  I'll do anything.  What the fuck?  Where is it?  Where is it?  I almost threw my laptop out of my fucking apartment and I live in the clouds.  I would have killed somebody.  Just dump it in the sink and start running water over it?  Because I don't know where the voice is coming from.  You can't find that picture, can you, Sam?  God, you're terrible at this.  What, the Getty image?  Getty images.  So anyway, sorry.  So the iPhone's busted.  It hit your head, bounced off the mirror.  What did she find that she was so pissed about?  I think it was a...  And why didn't she end it then? 
[00:48:30]  It was a text message or...  Yeah, it was a text message, I think.  There you go.  Oh, see, I just assumed...  Remember her?  I...  I kinda.  I was talking to Brewer a lot that night.  No, that was it.  Brewer was there, so...  I do remember her, and I remember thinking to myself, I'll just...  I'm uncomfortable.  That was the only...  I was thinking I'm uncomfortable.  That was the only date we went on.  Because I was very confused.  We just went on a date.  Because I thought you were going out with the other one.  I got really confused.  Oh, you were confused too.  And then I...  And then I realized it's better that maybe I just should keep my fucking mouth shut. 
[00:49:00]  Because I don't know my way around that world.  Oh, boy.  But anyway, so...  Who was the text message from?  I'm not a bad-looking broad, by the way.  I don't remember.  Yeah, she was cold.  You know, what are you gonna do?  But it turns out then her boyfriend texted or fucking DM'd.  Yeah.  He didn't threaten you, did he?  No, he was just really kind of pissed off at the whole situation.  Bummed out.  I didn't know he existed.  What are you gonna do? 
[00:49:30]  Hey.  For real?  Well, I really didn't.  Yeah.  Swear.  All right, so what was the text message she found that she threw the phone at you?  I don't remember.  I honestly don't remember.  I'm trying to think, but I don't remember.  But, no, that she didn't end it after that, too.  But you had...  I just said...  How do you not remember?  She threw a phone at you, so wouldn't that spark a memory, like, you remember TV shows  from 1964?  Look, let me tell you what was happening...  You don't want to say, I guess.  ...during that point in my life.  I'm assuming you don't want to say. 
[00:50:00]  No, no, no, no.  No, I would.  Look, I'm fessing up with everything here.  You'll sing some dumb jingle from 1972, but you don't remember the text message that  got her so pissy through a phone at your head?  The miracle of the kumia mind.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's so weird to me.  Yeah.  And I think you're being honest.  You really don't remember.  I am.  I don't remember that one.  Let me tell you what was going on in my life at the time.  Yes.  I had just come out of a very long-term relationship.  With who?  So, Nicolini?  No, no.  That was the Melinda thing.  The kumia girl was nice to me.  Even Nicolini was a...  The...  Who? 
[00:50:30]  Who's the long-term...  Even Nicolini was a kind of a rebounder.  You know?  Everybody was a rebounder at that point.  Wait, wait.  Before we move on.  Uh-huh.  So, there was Melinda, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Give me the ones that you consider were more than just a thing.  Oh.  Did it go Melinda, then Jill?  Or was there someone before that?  Or you don't want to do this?  Well, I don't...  You don't want to do this, do you?  Not really.  I don't want to, you know...  All right.  Give me just some basic...  Make a list.  Jesus.  Just give me a few. 
[00:51:00]  Well, it is Nicolini.  A few of the key ones.  All right.  So, you go...  All right.  Jill's in there.  Nicolini.  Closet.  I don't...  I don't know.  Honestly, I'm not sure.  All right.  I'm not sure how you base these things, you know?  Well, that's why I get confused who I'm supposed to be.  Well, me too.  All right.  No, no.  Go ahead.  See, here's the thing, though.  So, you're in a one-distance relationship, and then you wanted to have some fun.  At the time, there was a lot going on.  Honestly.  And what the model was seeing was this residual texting that was coming in that was, you know, 
[00:51:30]  leftover stuff, because I wasn't just going to...  See, here's something I wasn't going to do.  Just start texting people going, stop texting me.  I have a girlfriend.  Stop texting me.  She gets very angry.  Right.  So, occasionally, these texts would still come in.  Right.  Whether I answered them or not, you know, that's the big thing.  Right, right.  They're just coming in.  Gotcha.  But she would see the ones coming in and get very angry. 
[00:52:00]  Right.  Yeah.  It was pretty goddamn funny, though, because I guess yesterday, she had to come by to put  stuff in her car that was being hauled away.  You guys are cordial to each other, right?  Well...  No?  No?  No?  It's a very non-trusting detente, is what it is.  It's a, you know, balance of power thing, and a, you know...  Right.  Let's just realize what this is and get it over with. 
[00:52:30]  Gotcha.  So, so, I'm ready to leave, and I'm like, I can't find my other phone.  She goes, other phone?  I was like, yeah, I got two phones.  She goes, what do you got two phones for?  I go, my good boy phone and my naughty boy phone.  Just to give her the fucking...  She didn't know?  Turn the screw.  She didn't know.  And she's like, what's that?  I go, yeah, my old AT&T number.  You know, I still have that one. 
[00:53:00]  And then she's got to think back to, like, he got his Verizon one, like, a year ago.  Right.  And that whole time...  Wow, you wanted to turn the screws.  He actually kept the AT&T phone.  What'd you say to that?  Which I just kept it, by the way, because it's my...  It's really the business phone.  Like, I have my AT&T phone.  It's still, like, all my...  I didn't switch over my credit card contact number thing and all that shit.  So I just kept my AT&T phone.  My Verizon phone is more my personal life phone.  And she... 
[00:53:30]  Then it just hit her that, you know, I had had two phones the entire time.  But she never saw the two phones.  So obviously I was hiding one of the phones.  It's like the Prestige.  Ah, the great Dantan.  The phone had a bloody double.  It's a bloody jabu.  Where'd you hide the phone?  There were some evenings where I had the two phones, one in each pocket.  Holy shit.  And as I would go to bed at night, I would take the one phone out, and much like a prisoner  hiding a shank, I would shove it in the mattress under me in the bed. 
[00:54:00]  That's the first place people would check.  No, no.  While I was sleeping.  And then when I woke up, I would take it back out.  Ah, gotcha.  Then?  I can't even believe you lived your life this way.  Like, you go home and you're sliding shit in your own mattress.  Right?  Why would I have to do this?  That's your mattress.  My mattress.  You're supposed to be able to go home.  My mattress.  Why didn't you just, like, set her free and just live your life?  Why were you playing it both ways?  That's weird.  Yeah.  No, I don't.  Seriously. 
[00:54:30]  Anthony has stayed in many a relationship over the years.  But if you don't want to be in the relationship, why not just set her free and just do your thing?  To avoid confrontation.  Ah.  And conflict.  So how many, how, wait, all right.  So I know when you were married.  Oh, boy.  Maybe the first year was good, right?  What?  Okay.  So not even the first year?  So how long were you married?  I was paroled after nine years. 
[00:55:00]  All right.  So you wasted nine years of your life knowing that you didn't want to be in that.  And then you're saying, like, since then you've, what about, I don't want to, like, trash anybody.  So I don't want to bring it up.  But, well, it's up to you.  Like, other relationships, how long did you stay in there before you set yourself free knowing you were already miserable?  The Melinda one was pretty legit.  All the way to the end?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe the last year was a little shaky.  Yeah.  She ended up, like, wanting to do something else. 
[00:55:30]  And, you know, I don't know.  She just, you know, I think she got kind of tired of the whole situation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's the one that ditched me at the Borgata.  Right, right.  She just fucking, she's like, I'm leaving.  I went, okay, I'll be up later.  I thought she was just going to the room.  She's like, yeah, I'm leaving.  I was like, all right, you got a key?  And she goes, no, I'm leaving.  I was like, oh, um, what do you mean? 
[00:56:00]  I'm getting a U-Haul.  It's like, oh, wow.  Why would she drive a U-Haul home from Atlantic City?  We didn't bring that much stuff.  Oh.  You seem to be a smart guy.  What do you mean?  And then she goes, no, I'm getting my stuff and I'm leaving.  Wow.  Oh.  Oh, does this mean I don't have to deal with your fucking mom anymore?  All right.  Cool.  Another mom you didn't want to deal with, huh?  Let me tell you something.  She rivaled Judy. 
[00:56:30]  Really?  Although Judy, Judy was cool.  Judy was just kind of dumb fun.  You have to hate Judy and I get it, but she was kind of cool.  I don't really have to hate Judy.  You're right.  I never did.  She was kind of cool.  God rest her soul.  She did some dumb things that you had to deal with.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  In general, she was all right.  But Melinda's mom, oh.  Like what?  Just off.  She came off to me as a fucking shyster.  Really?  Oh my God.  Always scheming.  Always scheming for a buck. 
[00:57:00]  Really?  Yes.  So what'd you buy for her?  Teeth.  You bought her teeth?  I bought her teeth.  Actual teeth?  Yes.  I was bamboozled into buying her teeth.  Why do you?  I don't know.  She had a...  Why do you have that in your personality?  Like people, I gotta...  I've known this about him for a really long time.  He's actually very generous and charitable.  To a fault.  Charitable.  Like he's done things that he has never talked about. 
[00:57:30]  But why do you feel like you have to buy like your girlfriend's mom teeth?  First of all, I was pretty sick of looking at him.  All right.  Fair enough.  Oh my God.  It's like she was chewing on lock washers.  Fair enough.  Uh, yeah.  So, um, yeah, so, so actually, and here's how it happens many times.  It starts out as one thing. 
[00:58:00]  It ends it at another.  I was just gonna like, hey, take her to the dentist, right?  Have her fucking whip up some, some dentures and slap them in her fucking head.  Right.  And then it turned into, all right, well, give her this money.  And then she started this procedure to have the implants put in, not tits, teeth implants.  Right.  And, and since it started, you got to finish it.  Of course.  You put the post in and all that, right?  So now I started hearing, yeah, I started hearing, oh, well, she needs more money now for this. 
[00:58:30]  I was like, I, but I, I gave her a lot of things.  It's like, oh, you can't stop now.  Oh my God.  She's having the, I said, I never agreed to the implants.  Oh my God.  I just wanted, you know.  But knowing you, you just wrote that fucking check.  Polydent.  Right.  And then, yeah, because what am I going to do?  Right.  Fucking, now I'm, I'm with the, the daughter here and I got to fucking deal with the teeth.  How, uh, how much was it?  Dude, this was probably 20 G's.  Jesus.  Oh my God.  Probably 20 G's worth of fucking choppers in that head.  Jesus.  In that fucking head.  That was my wedding gift.  Fuck. 
[00:59:00]  It was crazy.  That's where it went.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I buy implants and they're fucking those.  Damn.  20 G's.  You got the good ones.  That's 20 fucking large.  Wow.  Two stacks of high society, motherfucker.  So do you get mad at the girls you're dating, but then avoid conflict and then come on the  show and yell at black people and then take out your rage that way?  God damn it, Sam.  Hey, a fucking psychologist.  Is that what happened?  Who the fuck are you?  I'm just asking.  Don't tell the fuck out.  We're just having fun here. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  Just asking.  Stop going deep.  All right.  What else did you buy her, though?  Was that it?  Um, let me see.  Now, over the years, there were always all the little things.  That was a big one, though.  That was a big one.  When you date Ant, man, he takes care of your entire family.  Oh, God, please.  There's been other things.  In the past, I actually had an instance yesterday where somebody texted me and wanted to know 
[01:00:00]  if I could rent them a car so they could go see a friend.  Who was it?  I declined.  Well, good for you.  I'm not even going to say.  You're on the right track now.  I'm not going to say.  Wow.  But it's somebody from the past.  We know?  Yeah.  You declined?  I declined.  Good for you.  Good for you.  I fucking declined.  You finally put your foot down.  Yeah.  I declined.  Wow.  Was it, um... 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Wow, this is fun today.  At least this one comes from a little bit of money.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Nice.  Apparently so.  Unbelievable, right?  The trials and tribulations of me.  So that's where it kind of ended with the motto, once the phone bounced off your head?  No.  It went for another fucking year and a half.  Jesus. 
[01:01:00]  After that one.  Yeah, but...  Of constantly checking my shit.  Mm-hmm.  Constantly, who's that?  You gotta get over it.  Then she looked over my shoulder once and saw the fuck, because I've decided, all right,  I'm gonna be smart.  I'm locking my fucking phone.  Nice.  Locking my phone.  She looked over my shoulder at one point, or just used some amazing fucking trained by  the CIA peripheral vision.  Yeah.  And saw my code I put in.  Oh, no.  And one night, you know, I must have gotten up to take a leak. 
[01:01:30]  The phone went, and she just boop, boop, boop, boop, with the fucking code, and read all  my texts and whatnot.  Well, what was the reason she stayed in it?  I'm very confused.  One of you should have fucking walked.  Let me think.  You obviously wanted something else.  No, I wanted no conflict.  Yeah.  Yeah, you gotta get over that.  I wanted no conflict.  You gotta start confronting.  A little conflict?  Yeah, you got a little bit.  Well, I have.  I have.  I confront a little too much. 
[01:02:00]  I definitely have.  A little too much.  And you confront never.  I've confronted.  I've confronted.  Or very little.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Yeah.  I've confronted.  Why didn't she leave?  That's a good goddamn question.  Maybe she was madly in love.  No, I don't think so.  She had all the answers right in front of her.  Why didn't she leave?  You know, everyone has their theories.  That's the universal question, obviously.  It's their theories.  So many people go, why just, you know.  I think because it's probably, it was a little difficult to just fucking, you know. 
[01:02:30]  Get up on everything?  Pick up and leave.  I mean, when she, you know, when things finally, you know, broke apart, she wound up having to stay in my apartment in the city for months.  Wow.  For fucking months.  Why did you allow that?  I do red eye and I had to fucking get a hotel.  Meanwhile, I'm paying for an apartment in the city.  Why did you allow that?  I did the same thing, though, by the way.  Yeah?  Yeah.  My ex lived in my Huntington place for probably a year after we broke up. 
[01:03:00]  I don't know why.  And I wanted that fucking place.  I wanted a little spot in Huntington.  So as much as I asked why, I did the same fucking thing.  Yeah.  Same fucking thing.  Had half my shit still in the house and everything.  I don't think.  Why?  I was too lazy to clean it all up all nice.  Yeah.  Did you buy her a car?  No.  No, she had a car.  You bought cars over the years, haven't you?  No.  I don't think I ever bought a car.  Oh, wait.  No, I got Melinda one.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  God damn it.  What now?  Oh, this reminds me, too.  What now?  This should be our last show.  We get it all out today and we move on.  I'm loving the vibe right now.  This would be a perfect last show.  Nah, no, no.  Get all the shit out.  There's plenty.  And then we fucking move on.  There's plenty.  Yeah, I got Melinda a Porsche Cayenne.  Jesus.  Whoa.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's after the Jeep Wrangler. 
[01:04:00]  I should go out with you.  You got her a Jeep Wrangler and a Porsche?  Well, the Jeep first.  Yeah, but you guys were going steady for a long time.  Yeah.  She had the Jeep first.  Yeah.  So then I got her the Caddy, the Caddy kind of SUV, minivan looking thing.  What was that called?  The Caddy SUV thing.  The Caddy something.  Right.  Some of the CRX.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah, I guess the CRX.  Nice.  Then I got her the Porsche Cayenne.  When she decided she was leaving, I didn't even ask for it back.  The Porsche?  Yeah.  Was it a lease?  No, it was paid for.  Holy shit.  That was yours.  Man, you got a fucking car in the end.  She then sold it.  Oh.  And gave a lot of the money away.  To who? 
[01:05:00]  Why wouldn't she keep the money?  Could be her mom.  Oh.  Again, the mom is haunting her.  Why wouldn't she keep the money?  I would assume she's not making a lot of money.  Exactly.  So why would you give the money away?  I know.  And after the money was given away, there were a couple of instances where I was asked for money.  I'm like, I can give you a $70,000 car.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  She went through the 70 Gs.  Or whatever she got for the car.  I don't know how it happens.  I guess the whole family got teeth.  Should get Jess to try to date you and then run some kind of scam or something. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  Some kind of scam.  Yeah, get a car.  Nice new clothes.  Definitely get a TV.  Get that TV.  For the love of Christ.  Yeah.  Wow.  So you're free and clear from the bottle now?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  She seemed pretty nice.  Huh?  I don't know.  I don't know the little I talk to her.  What?  I get scared to talk to her.  I'll try to talk to her.  I'll try. 
[01:06:00]  I'm going to have an open mind.  Oh, my God.  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  That's so odd.  You should have a revolving door.  It's your front door.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No.  People are...  That's ridiculous.  Holy shit.  Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.  That's exactly correct.  That's what they say when you buy, like, fucking stocks.  Yeah.  You're the man for having this whole conversation with a girl sitting there.  Well, she's under no delusions.  That's why it's awesome. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, there's no secrets here.  Yeah.  She knows the past.  Good.  Fucking...  I've spouted off on this very program.  Yeah.  You know?  Good.  They all assumed there were no secrets.  But there weren't.  Well, someone has to say it.  He had a naughty boy phone the entire time.  Some of that conflict that O.P. is seeking.  What?  Where do you think you're learning from, asshole?  I know.  Fuck off.  See the...  No, it's all good. 
[01:07:00]  See?  I know.  All right.  Look.  I will admit to the Nicolini debacle.  That got a little out of hand as far as...  Well, why did that get out of hand?  Well, you...  Because there was a Canadian in my closet.  No, I get it.  And that was the right thing to do for you.  But why would you invite them both to the house at the same time?  Very stupid of me.  That was really strange.  I have always wondered why...  Oh, that goes back to the no conflict.  Right.  Right.  But that is creating way more conflict.  Do you understand that?  I thought I was great at the plate spinning at the time. 
[01:07:30]  I thought I could spin those plates and keep them all on the ends of the sticks.  Is it true that when you had the big housewarming party, which I was over for...  Yeah.  They were both there.  Yeah.  Yes, Senator, that's true.  I remember going...  I remember going, holy shit.  Like, what is this guy trying to pull off right now?  Like, Jill...  The dumbest move ever, right?  I understand.  Jill Nicolini had a life-size cutout of her and aunt, and then the other girl is there. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  I'm like, holy shit.  I had to go to a funeral in Philly, so I had to leave early, and I was...  To this day, I was bummed.  I wish I was at the funeral.  I couldn't stay to watch it all play out, because I'm like, holy shit.  Yeah, I was out of town that day, too.  And she invited her whole family over.  Oh, my God.  I'm like, you're crazy.  What was I thinking at the time?  I swear.  I was going through some wild shit back then. 
[01:08:30]  Look, I get it.  I get it to a point, but I'm like, holy...  He is setting up a disaster right now.  I really was.  It was the perfect storm.  It was the Andrea Gale.  I remember as we're seeing the finished house and getting the tour, and Jill was basically  talking like, oh, yeah, it's just a matter of time before she's popping out little Anthony's.  Well, that's what got me right there.  Thank you very much.  And then the other one is near the pool.  Not the other one.  I mean, she's very nice and all that, but as far as this discussion goes, I didn't know  her at the time, and I'm like, holy fuck. 
[01:09:00]  What is he doing?  This is crazy.  That was cray, yo.  I was at a wrestling show, and that's the only time I regret going to a wrestling show.  Wow.  Really?  You would have seen more action.  I so wish I was there.  More action would have been seen.  It all went down that night, right?  Or later the next day?  The closet thing happened later that night.  It was...  Real late that night.  The next day.  Very early in the morning.  It was the next day.  So she...  Why would she do that?  How did you get...  It was her big party for you, too. 
[01:09:30]  She invited her whole family.  Do you understand...  Sam's laughing at me.  Do you understand her aunts and stuff brought, like, homemade baked goods?  They were so happy for Jill.  She made a big cardboard cutout.  How did you get Jill out of the house?  There was a huge cardboard cutout.  How did you get her out of the house?  It was the big...  Senator.  She left in tears.  Why?  Because I was paying too much attention to the Canadian.  Oh, she started figuring it out.  Senator, yes. 
[01:10:00]  This is factual, Senator.  But the whole party was put together for you and her.  And at this party...  This is true, Senator.  And then she left in tears.  And then she came back to the worst possible scenario.  How'd she get in the front door?  When she left in tears, all I was thinking was, yes, she's gone.  I'm not thinking that, you know, women could be vindictive.  You do believe women could be vindictive, right?  Oh, I learned. 
[01:10:30]  So why didn't you, like...  I learned.  I was, like I said...  Why didn't you deadbolt all the doors and windows after she left?  She had a key.  That's why I said deadbolt.  I figured she had a key.  She had a key to the deadbolts.  Well, I couldn't change the locks.  Yeah.  It was, look...  Why don't you hire someone to, you know...  Let me preface this again by saying...  To walk the perimeter.  Or post-fist this.  By saying, again, at the time, I was going through a lot of stuff.  I was still rebounding.  I was figuring things out. 
[01:11:00]  I had done nothing my entire life but be in long-term relationships.  And this was kind of a...  The lion was out of the cage.  I'll be the first to admit that you were doing exactly what you should have been doing.  I was crazy.  But the whole conflict thing.  I keep going back to that.  Yes.  Now, when Nicolini started talking about...  Yeah.  Wanting a kid.  Look.  She's fucking, at the time, was, I think...  How old was she?  Mid-30s, probably, right? 
[01:11:30]  Low 30s?  Killing her there.  I don't even think she was...  I think she was 29.  Oh, she looked a lot older.  And I think she...  In a good way, though.  No, no.  In a good way.  She had said she wanted to have a kid.  Yeah.  And she was, like, saying, you know what?  I want a kid before I'm...  And she threw out an age, and it was, like, the next year.  And how long have you been dating her?  Not long.  Not less.  Months.  Yeah.  Yes, it was months.  It was, like...  Yes, yes.  It was months. 
[01:12:00]  It was what they call a whirlwind.  It was months.  And I just started going, like...  I'm not going to fucking put up with this.  I can't...  I don't want to have a kid.  But then my point is, then you sit her down and go, eh...  You want something different here.  Let's just move on and be friends.  That's conflict.  That's conflict.  And was it a crossroads?  Yeah, but your conflict...  You're...  I'm sorry that I'm...  Oh, no, no.  You're right.  I know what you're going to say.  I'm sorry, but I...  The conflict I end up with is 20,000 times worse... 
[01:12:30]  I've done enough therapy...  ...than...  ...where I feel like I could tell you some shit.  When...  Like, you will...  Your whole thing is you want to avoid conflict, but by not, you know, tackling the issue at  hand, it makes it so much worse.  When you have a Canadian...  Which goes against the whole, I don't like conflict thing.  Right.  Never keep a Canadian in your closet.  And you're a smart guy, so how do you get around that?  I wasn't.  No, you're an intelligent guy.  How do you get around that?  Well...  Because you're creating way more conflict in the end.  Way more. 
[01:13:00]  I'm not Mr. Conflict anymore.  Now it's just like, look, this is it.  This is me.  I'm very open and honest now.  You still got two phones?  What?  Yeah.  I still have two phones.  She's cool with the two phones.  She's not saying I got two phones.  She's cool.  She sings songs about it.  I would think everybody knows she's got two phones now.  What does she want?  I don't know why the other one didn't.  You're singing songs about it.  She's got both numbers.  What does she want out of this?  What?  I don't know.  Go to a Yankee game?  Nice. 
[01:13:30]  Go see Bill Burr at the Carolines?  That's coming soon?  Yeah.  The whole last week's story was great radio.  Yeah.  It certainly makes for amazing radio.  No need to go there, yo.  Because she did, if you remember.  Jill, after she found an illegal immigrant in my closet, she ran out of the house, grabbed  my keys to my Escalade, and took off with a few items of mine.  She stole the Canadian's laptop, she took my car, she took my pistol license, which, by the 
[01:14:00]  way, I had just purchased a pistol, and I needed to take it down to the precinct with  my license to register it, but within 10 days, or else I lose my license.  Oh, wow.  And it's very hard to go down to the pistol register and say, well, I had a Canadian in  my closet, right?  And then the girl, she took my pistol, it's worse than the dog ate my homework.  So, um, she took off, and when I went to work, she came back to my house, and took the Canadian 
[01:14:30]  girl's clothing and a few other items, one of which was the ashes of her dead grandfather,  which the Canadian girl wanted to sprinkle into the ocean very nicely, threw it all in  my fire pit, covered it with tiki torch fluid, and lit a match.  Wow.  So, burnt all of her stuff.  By the way, um, still some brassiere underwires in my fire pit. 
[01:15:00]  Nostalgia.  A few zippers from jeans.  You refused to take that shit out of there, right?  No, it's kind of funny.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  Well, the Canadian girl was back, she was here like a month ago.  Yeah, I saw her, but I didn't know what was going on there.  And she was laughing going through the thing, she was sitting by the fire pit, hanging out,  talking to her grandfather.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That happens to be now the final resting place.  Of her grandfather, where she can go and visit with her.  Oh, my God.  Like a fucking cemetery. 
[01:15:30]  Like a crypt.  I have a crypt in my backyard.  Oh, my God.  You gotta, like, get a new fire pit and put a fucking gravestone over that shit now.  My grandfather's been cool sitting in the fire pit.  He's been cool.  He's enjoying the time there.  You see, like, a loose tooth or anything in there?  No.  No?  How's your mom's teeth?  They're good?  All right.  All good.  Good.  You're gonna save $20,000.  Yeah.  That's nice, actually.  I'm very happy about that.  Saved $20,000 large on the tooth thing.  How old's your mom? 
[01:16:00]  51.  All right.  Hey.  51.  I would have guessed a little younger, to be honest with you.  Oh.  A little younger.  Oh, how about that?  Why?  Oh.  She had kids later in life?  Okay.  I shouldn't talk.  I'm only a few years younger than my in-laws.  But they had kids really young.  Oh. 
[01:16:30]  Really young.  That's different.  I don't know.  We all get along, though.  Later in life.  Yeah.  I mean, real later in life.  She had a whole career and then decided.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  Wowie kazowie.  All right.  Shut up.  I'll shut up now.  The implications of that.  I've gone too far.  The implications of that, indeed.  What?  It's all on the up and up, though.  It is all on the up and up.  It's all on the up and up, Sam.  Shut up.  We live our lives openly.  Everything is good, you know, socially, economically. 
[01:17:00]  Nice.  Socioeconomically.  Spiritually.  Spiritually.  Oh, great.  Legally.  Everything's good.  So this one could be good.  Karmically?  Everything's fine.  Karmically?  Is that like when something's funny?  No, no, no.  Chip's on vacation, remember?  All right.  He's on vacation.  Oh, man.  Man.  Yeah.  A lot of people could relate to the no conflict thing.  Yes.  I think a lot of relationships last because of the no conflict ruling. 
[01:17:30]  And I want to bring myself into this thing.  I did the same fucking shit with my ex.  Yes.  You even knew.  We all saw it.  You even knew.  Let me think.  I went.  She liked to think it was longer, but I went.  I went to eight, I guess.  I would admit to eight.  I'm going to.  Actually, I'm going to repeat something you said once that was very funny.  Yeah.  And it uses the last name, if you don't mind.  No, I don't give a fuck. 
[01:18:00]  I hope he said to me once.  We're at N.E.W.  Yeah.  He goes, I can't wait to wash these Delgados right out of my hair.  Now that must say it.  But then it was another two years.  Yes.  Oh, man.  They were both fucking cunts.  Oh, shit.  Both of them.  And you were in there for another two years?  Easily.  Another two years.  Easily.  I don't even remember.  We were at the elevators at N.E.W.  I saw, you know, I did exactly what Anne's talking about. 
[01:18:30]  It sucks.  I knew, like, I knew, I knew when we were, I think I've told a story, but we were moving  to fucking New York.  We and Anne are fucking making it in radio.  Everybody wants to be in New York and doing radio.  And we were huge in Boston.  Huge.  But now we're getting the, this is the real big time, right?  This is the call every radio guy waits for.  And so we're coming home before it's all going down to visit, you know.  I had toiled in radio for almost three years.  Jesus. 
[01:19:00]  Before I reached the number one market in the country.  Jesus.  Yeah, I know.  I fucking hate you for that.  Thank you.  Thanks for the coattail.  At that point, I did 15.  Holy mackerel.  I think.  Wow.  Started in the, as a child of the 80s, I also started my radio career in the 80s.  Well, I don't know.  That was the Doogie Howser radio.  Doogie Howser radio.  I was.  What, gay?  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  So we're at the toll booth, the Throgs Neck. 
[01:19:30]  Oh.  And I'm all excited.  I'm like, holy shit.  This is what I've wanted for my whole career.  Aunt's excited.  We're moving home.  Oh, great.  But we're visiting.  I turn on NEW.  They're playing the Allman Brothers.  I remember.  I forgot which song, but they're playing the Allman Brothers.  And I'm beyond excited.  I'm ready to jump out of the fucking car.  I'm like, here it is.  We're going to be on NEW.  Oh, my fucking God.  I can't believe it.  We're going to be doing afternoons.  This is amazing.  I mean, people, they haven't hired a jock at this point at NEW in like 20 years. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  We were the first hire in literally almost 20 years.  Yeah.  And I look over to see if she's sharing my excitement and she's breaking down crying.  Because she had to leave.  She had to leave Boston.  But she broke down crying.  She had to leave the waiter at Mother Anna's.  Yeah.  That fuck.  I almost went in there.  I almost went in there to just punch him in the face when I was up there recently.  Dude, I wanted to hit that guy so bad, too, when we were just sitting there.  And he was just falling over my chick.  She's like fucking kind of flirty eye. 
[01:20:30]  And he's fucking flirty.  And I was damn good looking at that time.  Still am.  Goddamn.  I was really good looking at that time.  And I put up with some shit.  I'm like, really?  Fucking greasy, greaseball, wap, guinea fuck is trying to pick up my girl at the fucking Mother Anna's.  So she's crying.  Because she got a dumb little who gives a fuck job in Boston.  And she didn't want to leave Boston.  And at that moment, I should have said, then stay in fucking Boston.  Stay here, then.  But, nope.  What's it to you?  So at that point, it was definitely it. 
[01:21:00]  So I went in another, that would be three years then, I guess.  Another three years.  No, we did four years at NW.  So I did four years.  So as much as I ask you why, I should ask myself why.  Although I know now through therapy and all sorts of shit.  When you were done with that, did you completely swear off being unhappy in relationships?  Like, did you change?  What do you mean?  Like, like...  No, I mean, what made it easy was me and Aunt were like on a rocket ship.  So I didn't have fucking time to deal with a bad relationship.  That was my fault, I guess. 
[01:21:30]  I see.  And we got to see some shit, Sam.  I bet you did.  We got to see some shit.  Wish I was there.  We saw some shit, man.  Oh, God.  Literally.  Coming out of the girl's asshole.  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  I don't know if I want to see that.  So, I mean, the same thing with me.  And then I remember Scott Herman, our old GM from NW.  He knew I was a married man at the time.  Are you a married man, Mr. Cumbia?  Married man when we first got to NW. 
[01:22:00]  NW?  Yeah.  Which was 98, by the way.  Yeah, 98.  And within a year, it was over Johnny.  Right.  That fucking farce of a marriage.  And I do remember Melinda coming in.  And then I was down in the parking garage.  And, of course, we were, like, saying our goodbyes, I guess.  And Scott Herman's walking in.  And he sees this.  Just making out, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And he...  Heavy petting?  No.  In the garage?  Was there heavy petting? 
[01:22:30]  It was just a little, you know, little...  I'll see you soon.  Peck on the cheek.  Okay.  It wasn't heavy petting.  It was a take it easy kind of a thing.  In front of Jamaican Mike?  In front of Jamaican Mike and his giant cock.  Yeah.  Giant Jamaican cock.  He ran the parking garage.  And I always assumed...  Did we ever confirm that he had a giant cock?  Because we did many bits on his giant cock.  He had to.  He used to unlock the doors that when they locked keys in the car with his cock.  He'd use it like a fucking...  One of those fucking things.  Yeah.  Fucking...  So he saw that.  And Scott Herman, our GM, then called me into the office. 
[01:23:00]  To talk about that?  To talk about it.  That's HR shit.  You could have fucking got him in trouble with HR.  Not really.  Oh, I could have.  Yeah, yeah.  It was in the parking garage.  You could have said none of your fucking business.  None of your goddamn...  No, he was doing it as a friend, I guess.  He was cool.  He was trying to tell me, look, I know you're married.  He was giving me like the fucking...  The Pauly speech from Casino.  But you gotta go back.  You gotta go back.  He said you gotta go back.  No, no, he didn't say that.  But it was like the...  Oh, okay.  It felt like it was the Pauly speech that him and De Niro gave to... 
[01:23:30]  Sure, sure.  Leota in the apartment.  There's a whore living in your apartment.  So, he was telling me, you know, I saw...  I don't know how discreet you're being if I saw that.  And I just looked at him and went, I don't give a shit.  I said, I don't care who sees.  You think I'm trying to fucking be clandestine about this?  Right.  I loved the fact that it was getting back to my fucking shit wife.  Yeah, but that only meant you to...  Shit wife. 
[01:24:00]  By the way, how's marriage working for you there, Sam?  I love it.  But that only...  My beautiful wife and I are very happy.  But that only meant that she was gonna make it hurt more.  Yeah, that kind of backfired on me.  No, I'm just saying the conflict thing, which we both fucked up with.  I had a let's make a deal moment, too, with the ex-wife.  Motherfucker.  I think it was like fucking...  It was right after 9-11, because I remember I had to meet her in a bar and discuss, without  lawyers or anything, some kind of settlement negotiation.  And I remember like 9-11, shit was on the TV, and it was crazy. 
[01:24:30]  And she threw a figure out there that I denied.  How much more did you pay?  Or you don't want to say?  Oh, so much more.  Give me a...  Probably ten times more.  Oh, my God.  I chose unwisely.  Oh, you got the donkey.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I got zonked.  Wow, wow, wow.  I got zonked.  You got a whammy.  I was zonked.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Well, that was cute.  Yeah.  I saw what happened right there. 
[01:25:00]  No, another visitor is coming in.  Oh.  Another visitor.  Really?  No, no, it's just a friend.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, she's been to a few appearances and whatnot.  We'll know her, too.  Probably.  Yeah, yeah.  Ten times.  I chose so unwisely.  I could have written one check and been done with it.  Could you write the number down?  I need to know.  I won't say it.  I promise you.  Okay.  Here.  All right.  We can write it in the air so there's no record of it. 
[01:25:30]  That's okay.  I'll be tweeting this immediately on OP Radio.  I could have gotten out of the whole thing for that.  Yeah, that's about what I was thinking.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then it was ten times that?  No.  It wasn't this in the end?  No, it was probably...  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  These are just...  That's a house.  Unrealistic numbers.  That's a real...  I couldn't even...  You can't even fathom that.  No, I can say that.  No. 
[01:26:00]  I can say this much.  That's a nice house.  Oh, yeah.  Without giving too much away.  Oh, it's a castle if you're in Iowa.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah.  God damn.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Unreal, right?  Yeah, I don't do the...  I don't...  Yeah, I learned a lot.  That conflict thing...  I learned a lot.  I think most people do it, though.  You got to.  I really do.  But I don't think they do it to the extent you do it.  Oh, is that funny?  I think when I showed you, the Paltor cameras got it. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, well, what do you think?  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I went like this.  I'm like...  I'm like...  Oh, God.  Well, there you go.  So someone...  Now I went out there.  That's what I...  I could have gotten out of it for this.  So tell the listeners, then, if the Paltalkers know.  I could have gotten out of it for a half a mil.  Jesus Christ.  She said, you write that check, I leave.  Yeah.  Would have been over, Johnny.  Let me think at the time.  Was it smart for you to stay in? 
[01:27:00]  No.  No.  Well, now, no.  But, I mean, I'm thinking.  You were convinced you could get out before that.  Yeah, but you probably would only...  Whatever.  Dude.  Without the lawyer fees, also, it would have just been done.  Without the aggravation of Dominic Barbara.  Yeah, that shit almost killed you.  I know.  Fuck it.  I hated that.  That shit almost killed you.  I should have just...  I remember the day we were in our office.  I don't know if I've ever said this in the air.  Dad, fuck you, Jimmy Walker.  Sorry.  Trash and Leno and Letterman. 
[01:27:30]  And then he wants to be on our show.  Go fuck yourself, you miserable bastard.  He's an asshole.  Had him on once or twice.  He's miserable.  Stinks.  Sorry about that.  I remember you were, like, you were...  Our desks were right next to each other, and you were kind of...  I think you were more talking to yourself, but I was there.  And I saw that you were sort of, like, going...  It was almost like a coin flip whether or not you were going to call the lawyer and set the whole process in motion.  Oh, set it moving, yeah.  Or try to make it work. 
[01:28:00]  And then I remember distinctly, and I know this was your exact words, you said, fuck it.  And then you picked up the phone and called the lawyer to start the proceedings.  By the way...  That would last many years.  Here's another great thing.  By the way, I fucked up because I tried to go cheap on the lawyer.  Wasn't it the new girl's lawyer?  Fucking...  Again, Melinda, yes.  Because she was like, hey, I do, you know, part-time office work for a lawyer. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, man.  But it wasn't a divorce attorney.  No, he was like a...  What were you thinking?  He was like a contract lawyer.  And I was trying to tell Ann, I'm like, I got this broad out on Long Island.  This is what she does.  And she fights Dominic.  Oh.  Dude, I should have gotten that fucking guy that...  Or the other guy.  Fucking...  Yeah.  Whatever his name is.  Why'd you go with that lawyer?  Because I was so upset that I had to pay for her lawyer.  You wanted a cheap lawyer.  And I was paying so much money.  Here's how divorces work. 
[01:29:00]  You're paying for your wife's lawyer to fuck you in the ass.  Right.  She gets the best lawyer.  Right.  And then you're left going like...  So when the wife gets the best lawyer, you...  She...  Raul fucking...  What's his name?  Oh, yeah.  She doesn't have to pay for that.  So, of course, she's going to get the best lawyer.  And then you turn around and you go,  Holy fuck, I have to pay for her lawyer,  so I can't afford a good lawyer myself.  I got to go cheap.  Yeah, yeah.  Jackie Childs.  That's what...  Jackie Childs.  This shit should be illegal.  Someone should fucking... 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Figure out that.  Figure that out.  And God, the women get mad when they hear this.  But in general...  I'll say in general,  because every time we say this,  a few women will call.  They're in...  In general, guys get completely fucked.  There are no good lawyers named Raul.  In divorce situations.  No, Denver Pest.  There's a guy named Raul...  He was legendary.  He is the premier divorce attorney.  Yeah, at the time, he was like the number one.  Ralph Felder.  Thank you.  Yeah, he was like the number one in New York.  Yes.  I don't know if he's still, you know...  I should have gotten him. 
[01:30:00]  That would have knocked fucking Dominic's teeth in.  That motherfucker.  Yeah.  But instead, I went on the cheap,  and I had to have had the worst lawyer  I've ever fucking seen in my life.  Dominic must have saw him coming.  Oh, Dominic, by the way,  they brought in those big cardboard file boxes  on hand trucks.  Swear to you.  You know that was a prop.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, it had to be.  Just an intimidation prop.  There's no way he had that much shit on you.  His fucking lunch was in there.  Yeah.  Cocksucker.  That was a prop, that fucking showboarding asshole. 
[01:30:30]  And my lawyer came in with, like,  like I used to go into school  with a piece of paper and a pencil  folded up in my pocket.  God, the judge should have felt sorry for you.  I think the judge did, but...  And Dominic was constantly getting, like,  experts to do things.  Right.  And then I'd get charged for it.  We need an actuary  to determine the future value  of Mr. Kubia's career  and how his wife should share 
[01:31:00]  in this opportunity that he's been given  because of their joint...  You fucking Jabba the Hutt monster.  But shouldn't the court step up  and if, you know, the wife there  or the ex-wife, you know,  hires the really nice, really good lawyer  and there's experts and all that  and then she gets a settlement in the end,  they should take that off the fucking top.  They don't.  I know they don't.  At least do that for the guy. 
[01:31:30]  A settlement is a settlement.  So you get to negotiate everything.  I had to literally negotiate  that I would pay him.  Like Dominic spelt out a bunch of things  and I had to eat it  because I was looking at so much money  and lawyer fees  and he was stretching this.  It was going on three years.  Three years I was paying for her lawyer.  So I was just like...  Do you know the number you paid?  No, not offhand. 
[01:32:00]  It was a lot.  Write that down without pal talks to you.  I'll just say it had to be  hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Just for her lawyer alone.  Hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Just for her lawyer alone.  Just for the lawyer fees alone.  And of course he's going to...  And of course,  and they're all in on it.  The judge, the lawyers,  the court itself.  You know,  if you're getting paid nice,  why would Dominic Barber settle anytime soon?  Exactly.  Why would you settle?  And everyone knows  that's what these guys do.  Yep.  So I had to...  I had to eat a lot 
[01:32:30]  in that settlement  just to end it.  Just end it.  Wow.  But...  You got to just write a book  and call it Whoops.  Whoops.  I could add all my whoopsies  in there.  All the whoops-a-daisies I did.  Why would you invite  another girl to the party  that a girl is throwing for you  with her family and friends  and planned it for a long time?  I really was just a scum bag.  Cardboard cutouts.  That's me.  There were cardboard cutouts.  You were in a Hawaiian shirt.  Me and her in Hawaiian shirts. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, you guys had matching Hawaiian shirts.  She had a little grass skirt on.  What did you think?  She had her entire family.  Her entire extended family  took up a couple of the tables.  I was a scum bag, I know.  When she had you wear  the Hawaiian shirt  and the fake lei  and then made a cardboard cut out of it,  what did you think?  I can't wait to sit next  to the other girl.  This is going to be trouble.  This is going to be trouble.  Why wouldn't you just tell  the other girl  who we know now?  I say the other girl  because at the time  that's all we knew.  Why wouldn't you get her  like a hotel room 
[01:33:30]  and say,  why don't you fucking chill out  for a day or two?  Because I wanted her  to go to the party.  It was a fun party.  It was for you and your...  What I would assume  would be your...  It was a jacuzzi.  Your next wife.  Everyone there assumed  from her side of the family  certainly  that this was your next...  that you guys  were going to get married.  It was a very volatile situation.  Oh my God.  I didn't know  how to deal with it.  He had a crush  on the other girl.  He wanted to hang out with her.  And you knew the party 
[01:34:00]  was going to be so fun.  Who cares the circumstances  of said party?  Yeah, yeah.  That I want you  to enjoy the fun party.  Yeah, yeah.  Logically makes sense.  It was a fun party.  We were in the jacuzzi.  You and the other girl?  Yeah, and then I turned  the bubbles on and...  No.  Yeah, a little bit.  Oh my God.  Where was she?  With Nicolini still there?  Where was she?  She was giving me  the eyes like she used  to give to fucking  traffic on the LIE.  Oh really?  From the helicopter.  While the bubbles were on? 
[01:34:30]  She was the traffic girl.  Yeah, she was like  standing by the barbecue  at one point.  And I was looking over  and I'm like,  uh oh, I think she's  on to this whole scene.  Whoa!  That's why she left in tears.  She figured it out  on the spot.  Did she have her...  Because everyone,  all of her family  and friends  were coming up to her  and going,  what the fuck is going on  over there?  What's he doing?  Oh my...  Did she...  That was extremely embarrassing.  That's the craziest shit ever.  Craziest shit ever, right?  She was in the backyard  making direct eye contact.  And you were like,  the bubbles are on.  Did she have suspicions  before that? 
[01:35:00]  I thought...  Was it like camouflage?  What?  Did she have suspicions  before that?  I don't think so.  Did she after?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  It got bad.  Well, it was just,  you know,  she burned shit and left  and that was it, right?  Uh.  She made it all nice in the end.  I had to have an intermediary  go regain custody of the laptop.  Right.  And my pistol license.  Right.  And my Escalade.  Right.  That was probably 
[01:35:30]  my favorite K-Rock bit ever.  You shouting about  how all your stolen goods  were not back.  They've been stolen from you.  And you didn't have them.  I really was bad.  I know.  I know.  That was a...  It was a...  And especially when you just  talk about it like this  in hindsight  with so much time going by.  Believe me.  I'm not sitting here  thinking I was  a fantastic person  at the time.  It was a terrible thing.  I did.  It all logically makes sense  except for the whole 
[01:36:00]  conflict thing  that you just make  way worse for yourself  even though you want to  avoid that your entire life.  Yeah.  We should break.  It's been two hours.  Oh my god.  Look at the time.  What else should we talk about?  Fuck what's going on  in the news.  Let's get some shit out today.  Let's do it.  It's always fun to just  Let's get some shit out today.  Blow yourself up on the air.  I don't think so.  No.  I don't think so at all.  No, it's not.  I know.  I think you explained  yourself perfectly.  By the way,  this isn't anything new.  No.  I'm not saying anything new.  This is shit  that I've talked about 
[01:36:30]  as it's happened  over the years  all condensed  into one nice little package.  Right.  Because all of these  separate instances  I've talked about  Melinda's mom's teeth.  Right.  Oh, hell yeah.  I haven't talked about  her sister's fucking  motorhome I bought.  Why'd you buy her  a motorhome?  Well,  I went up to see  to visit with Melinda.  I went up to visit  her sister  who had just had  a brand new baby.  Aww.  That baby's about what?  12 or 13 now?  From another dad  and then she was married 
[01:37:00]  to some other guy  with two kids.  Wait, what?  She was married at the time  when she was having  a baby with somebody else?  Wait, what?  No.  See, she was going out  with a guy, right?  Yeah.  She got pregnant.  Okay.  And they broke up.  Okay.  And she married  some other guy.  Okay.  Had the kid.  The other guy  had two kids.  One of the kids  that the other guy  had?  Booger couch kid.  Oh!  Everything does  come together.  Reventures together. 
[01:37:30]  The husband  of Melinda's sister.  Wait, wait, wait.  His...  Yeah, okay.  I gotcha.  One of his sons  was the one  that was picking his nose,  wiped it on my couch,  and then couldn't  find the booger.  So I threw the couch away.  Threw it away!  Makes sense.  Look how it all  comes together.  Booger couch.  Booger couch.  That was the famous  booger couch.  But why the motorhome?  So, well,  we, uh,  me and Melinda  decided,  well, Melinda decided  we were gonna drive up  to Andes, New York. 
[01:38:00]  Ever been to Andes, New York?  It's spelt like  the Andes Mountains.  Yeah, it's near  Woodstock and all that,  I think.  It is the middle  of fuck dick nowhere.  Oh, really?  It looks beautiful.  This is where  the mom and sister lived.  Holy shit,  that's like some  hillbilly shit.  Dude!  No cell service.  That looks nice.  I like that.  This is, by the way,  You should buy  the whole town.  I could.  I could have  before my divorce.  My ex-wife could.  Yeah.  This is, by the way, 
[01:38:30]  the same place  I went hiking,  got lost,  and almost got eaten  by a bear.  Right.  Wow!  It all comes together.  But we would assume that  because all I see  is mountains.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Is that the Adirondacks?  No cell service.  I don't know what it is.  It's the fucking  lonely shit mountains.  Yeah.  That's what I called it.  And we used to go there  and the mom lived there  with her teeth  and the daughter lived there  with her boyfriend  and then the husband  and the booger couch kid.  Right. 
[01:39:00]  Well, we go up there  to visit because  she's got this new baby.  So Melinda wants to see  her niece.  Right.  So we drive up there.  Did you want to go?  Never.  I never wanted to go  to Andy's New York.  Hated that place.  Why?  It looks like nature.  Looks serene.  Nature's nice.  How's the town?  What's that?  How's the town?  There's nothing there.  They don't have a saloon?  They have literally  How about an antique shop?  Four antique shops.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  It looks like one of those  types of towns.  One of which run  by a celebrity.  Who?  Well.  I gotta find out.  Do you remember  a little show  called Major Dad?  Of course.  Do you remember  The Major Dad Guy?  No.  Oh, he wasn't even  the Major Dad Guy?  Remember Gunny?  No.  I never saw Major Dad.  The Dykey Woman?  No.  Yeah?  Let me see.  You remember her.  Of course.  Remember this woman?  Yeah, get the smallest  picture possible.  Well, in this case  it's smart  because she's an ugly bro.  Oh, dude. 
[01:40:00]  She was fucking heinous.  Holy shit, is she ugly.  Gunny ran the fucking...  She was...  And she might as well  have been...  Yeah, she might as well  have been like  the fucking celebrity.  Like A-lister.  For the town.  Oh, by the way.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  There was another  huge celebrity  that ran an antique shop  right across the street  from her.  No way.  You might know her  as John Travolta's mom. 
[01:40:30]  Whoa.  Yep.  Star-studded.  Why is she stuck up there?  I don't know.  I guess John Travolta  hates his mom.  Yeah.  I think.  I don't know.  Let me tell you,  a lot of the gays  were up there.  A lot of the gays  antiquing.  Yeah.  Andes.  Yeah, it's in Andes,  New York.  So we go up there.  Motor home.  New kid.  Niece.  Yeah.  Well, let me add a little bit.  The first time I ever 
[01:41:00]  went up there with Melinda  to visit her mom,  I went up with my  brand new SUV.  Oh, I thought you were  going to say my  brand new girlfriend.  Well, there was one time  I went up with my wife  and her.  That's exhausting.  It was exhausting.  That's exhausting.  Yeah, yeah.  Just living a lie.  It was crazy.  I wouldn't say living a lie  because everyone was in  at that point.  Yeah, yeah.  No, believe me. 
[01:41:30]  Everyone knew everything  at that point.  Oh, it was crazy wild.  Except when your ex  was in the shower.  But you were up.  That's true.  So what happened?  Well, then her mom  decided that...  No teeth at this point?  Oh, the teeth were  just a disaster at that point.  I hadn't fucking sprung yet.  But the mom decided  the dog had to be taken  to the vet or something  because it was sick.  So she wanted...  She was like,  could I put it  in your truck?  Oh.  The dog put dog food 
[01:42:00]  and diarrhea  all over my brand new SUV.  Oh, my God.  And she made a diaper  out of a towel  to put around the dog.  I was fucking...  And I'm pulling kibble  out of my fucking truck  for months.  Hold on.  And you know  that she chose  that weekend  because she knew  you would pay.  Thank you.  It's so obvious.  Oh, everything.  She could have brought  the dog in any day.  That's why I hated  going there.  One time I went there  and she was trying  to get me to put screens  in the fucking windows  of the house.  This house was ready  to fall into the river. 
[01:42:30]  Oh.  Oh.  The river should have  taken that house.  I never stayed  at the mom's house either.  I stayed there once.  I always stayed  at this shitty fucking  hunting lodge hotel  that was up there.  But, okay,  so we go up  to visit the sister  and the new niece.  I walk into this trailer  that is just on  some farmer's property.  I guess they were  paying some farmer money  to keep their trailer  on his property.  The trailer had to be  from like the 70s  and it had holes 
[01:43:00]  in the roof.  Water was literally  leaking like steeped tea  in the insulation  into the crib.  Jesus.  What?  Yes.  But you know  they set up the crib  like that  knowing you're  and no offense  I say it for this story  knowing that you're a sap.  You know they did that.  They put the crib  under the leak.  I was bamboozled  constantly I think.  Because you had to think  wait a minute  there's no way  they had to have 
[01:43:30]  the crib under the leak.  Why would you do that?  But they knew  that you would see that  and then you would  fucking break out  your fucking checkbook.  Not only that  flies everywhere  in this place.  There were flies  flying around  like it was  like it was  fucking India.  Wow.  Like it was Calcutta.  Wow.  Unbelievable.  How much was  the new motorhome?  I don't know  what they go for.  Boy that family  sure was pretty  consistent with the amount.  I was going to guess 
[01:44:00]  20.  Another 20 G's  pumped into  that family.  So what got you?  Was it the water  dripping into the crib  or was it  your girl at the time  feeling bad  about the whole situation  and working you?  Here's what happened.  Was she working you?  No.  I actually looked  and said  I went  this can't  you can't do this.  You can't live like this.  Right.  So I decided  I would look into  getting them 
[01:44:30]  a new trailer  but  just kind of  similar to what they had  but without the leaks  not like  something  So probably a trailer  that would have been  10 G's  Exactly.  Like maybe a used one  maybe a little used  Dude I was thinking  6 to 8 G's  Okay so  I get what you're saying.  Yeah.  Well  that  turned into  us all  going  to this  trailer sales place  Whose idea was that?  Was it the same day? 
[01:45:00]  The mom  No no no  this was like  over the place  So you went back home  to your really nice life  Yeah yeah yeah  You had a little guilt  associated with what you saw?  But it was just kind of  the ball was rolling  Once I started  Well not guilt  but did you feel bad  when you got back home?  No.  I'll be honest no.  So what the fuck?  Because I just knew  the ball was already rolling  on this  Right.  And once  I put the bug  in anyone's ear  that  wow that's terrible  you know  they should get a new trailer  that instantly turned into  hey Anthony's buying this  Let's get right on it 
[01:45:30]  Right.  So you had to go  back up to Andy's  Back up to Andy's  To go trailer shopping?  Go trailer shopping  Oh  And the only one  that could be found  of course  was a beautiful one  that was like  fucking  ten feet wider  fucking  forty feet longer  and  no leaks  had a beautiful  bathroom  with a  tub  and  fucking  with jets in it  and everything  and giant kitchen  with all new appliances  twenty thousand dollars  and then  you don't just 
[01:46:00]  fucking  you know  hitch it up  and take it there  the delivery fees  the setup fees  the setup  all of it  what the hell  was I thinking?  Wow  wow  oh my god  and then I'm sure  there were other  little things  here and there  with that whole situation  little things  just things  constant things  I'm gonna miss  Anthony Cumia  I'm gonna miss  your brother  I  miss Anthony Cumia  I don't look back 
[01:46:30]  with much regret  I just  oh look we just  checked into  the pal talk room  who?  the crazy Canadian  please tell her  I love the bubble  story more than life  she's cool  she's totally cool  she's gonna be like  she's gonna be like  so what are they  talking about today?  should we break  finally?  yeah let's  let's eat  talk about other shit  yeah 
[01:47:00]  much better to talk  about at this point  oh my god  it's up to you Sam  I'm trying to think now  I gotta go year by year  and see if there's  anything I missed  ask some questions  I'm gonna ask you  a bunch of questions  but then ask it immediately  Sam might ask questions  next  stay there  okay  We'll be right back. 
[01:47:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:48:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:48:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:49:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:49:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:50:00]  I'm going to go out.  Secondly, that is so offensive.  Jesus.  I was thinking that.  Remember what you used to do?  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, yeah.  We had that on regular radio, right?  I guess something happened in Cuba.  That's where I'm going out on a limb. 
[01:50:30]  I remember fucking when we did that.  That's you and brother Joe, by the way.  Me, Joe, Hugo from Evolution, I guess, that journey band.  He looks just like Steve Perry.  Right.  And Joe Curry.  Yep.  There's a bunch of it.  We did all that.  That was all live.  We just fucking, like, miked the band and just ran through it.  Wow.  I remember doing that.  No one does that anymore.  No.  That was fun, though.  It's a great song.  Jesus.  I think it was because of, yeah, there was a bunch of stuff going on with Cubans wanting 
[01:51:00]  to come over.  They were floating over.  Constantly, yeah, drowning or something.  I don't know.  Why the song today there, Eeroch?  Well, Ileon Gonzalez returned to Cuba 12 years ago.  12 years ago?  Jesus.  How old was he at the time?  Six?  Seven?  Six?  Seven?  Uh-oh.  Maybe six or seven?  How old was he?  Remember the fucking picture?  Remember the famous picture? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, with the guy with the fucking gun.  What gun is that, by the way?  You should know.  Oh, shit, I think I have that gun.  Really?  Yeah, that looks like an MP5.  The guy is...  That's the same one that...  That's the MP5?  Yeah, I think that's the same one that Mike Baker has in his picture.  I can't really see...  And who's holding the kid back?  I think it is.  That was his uncle or something.  Uncle in Florida there, Miami?  Yeah.  Guy comes in and he ain't fucking around. 
[01:52:00]  Give me that fucking kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, boy, where's...  Fuck, where's Elion?  Where's that guy holding the gun to the kid?  No kidding.  Where's he?  And how old is Elion?  He was seven years old when that happened.  So he's almost 20 years old now.  And he doesn't give a fuck about America, right?  Wow.  Look at him.  Wow, look.  He is like...  Oh, man, he's all in.  He's all in.  You can see the days in his eyes.  He looks like fucking young Castro.  Oh, man, what he would have had in America. 
[01:52:30]  Poor guy.  Not that snappy uniform, I'll tell you that much.  What happened to all the players in this story?  Like, remember the lady, how hateable she was?  She came out of the house with the kid because the army guy handed over the kid after he grabbed  it out of the uncle's arms.  The crying woman.  And gave it to...  No, gave it to that brutal, like, stoic, cunty woman.  Yeah.  Who ran out of the house with the kid with all the photographers flashing away.  Yeah, and then who was the hot one?  Remember the hot...  There was a hot one?  I don't remember a hot one. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, I think there was a hot one involved in it somehow, some way.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  I'm not sure.  I would love to know what's going on with a lot of the people from this case.  Yeah.  And he never came back, obviously.  That was it.  Nope, that was it.  That was it.  And he's all in.  They use him as propaganda and all that, right?  Oh, yeah.  They love using him like, hey, here's a kid that wanted to come back.  He really wanted...  Look, he's doing so well.  He wanted to come back.  He wanted to.  They just ignore all the footage of the army men. 
[01:53:30]  That guy wearing that dumb helmet.  Right.  That dumb helmet and his fucking dumb goggles.  Right.  I love that guy.  Look at him.  But isn't that one of our guys?  Yeah.  He just looks stupid.  Why the fuck didn't we say Cuba to fuck off?  I forget now.  I don't know.  It would have been a political firestorm.  Yes, an international incident.  We were avoiding a political firestorm.  Yes.  But to go in like that, my God. 
[01:54:00]  All in right there.  So...  Yeah, for sure.  That was 12 years ago?  12 years.  Wow.  And I got a better one, eh?  Oh.  Remember when Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ear?  Of course we all remember that.  Do we?  That's 15 years ago, right?  Wow.  Jeez.  15 years ago today as well.  He spit that fucking piece of ear out there on the canvas.  They zoomed in on it with the camera.  Oh, boy, did they.  That freaked fucking people out, man. 
[01:54:30]  That, like, completely solidified Mike Tyson as a fucking animal.  Oh, yeah, it did.  Yeah, we got video of that.  People couldn't believe it.  I got serious.  They could not fucking believe he did that.  When he tears his head to the side and rips his fucking ear off, piece of his ear off...  He goes for the ear, too.  Yeah, yeah.  The bite, pulls away...  Ow!  You know what? 
[01:55:00]  Tyson gets a bad rap there.  I haven't seen this video in a while.  He does go for the bite, because Tyson was unpredictable, right?  Yeah.  So he bites the ear, and Holyfield's like, what the fuck?  And he pulled away.  I always thought Tyson pulled away.  Watch again.  He's biting, and Holyfield's like, get the fuck off me, and pulls away.  I can't believe what I'm seeing, fellas.  I can't believe what I'm seeing.  It's like hell, but he certainly had a big bite.  I think the reason why the... 
[01:55:30]  I can't believe what I'm seeing.  The reason why the ear came apart, though, is because Holyfield, you know, pulled away.  What's he supposed to do, though?  No, I know.  I know.  That's fucked up.  But I always remember it as Tyson biting and pulling.  It looks like he pulls down, though.  Tyson's head goes down like he's...  You think?  Yeah, a little bit.  So he goes down a little bit, and then Holyfield is trying to get him off of him, so he pulls  away, and that's why the ear fell off.  God, that's crazy.  That is crazy.  And he just spits it out.  15 years ago today.  I can't believe what I'm seeing.  A Supreme Court ruling on Obama's health care law today, huh? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, there's a couple of big decisions today on that one.  Are they going to shoot that down today, or is it going to be really close?  Well...  And if they shoot it down, that's the end of Obama's presidency, you think?  Uh, well, boy, there's speculation on both sides what that means.  Uh, I think, in my opinion, I think they're going to...  How are they going to rule, first of all?  I think they're going to rule partial.  I think they're going to say that some of the, uh, aspects of his health care reform is 
[01:56:30]  unconstitutional, especially the part that requires people to buy insurance.  I think what they're saying here is that the government cannot, uh, mandate, uh, that the  public purchase something.  Right.  You can't make it a law that the public has to buy something, or they'll be penalized.  So I see that part getting thrown out.  Um, what other parts they throw out?  I don't know, but I don't think they're going to trash the whole thing.  So then, it'll be kind of status quo for Obama, then? 
[01:57:00]  Uh, it doesn't look good, though.  I think they might...  He wants the whole thing, obviously.  It depends on how much they, they pick it apart and bastardize it from what he initially  wanted.  Uh, but, um, I think there's still going to be a piece of it.  When are they voting?  I know it's today, but when?  I think that's...  First thing?  I'm not sure.  I, uh, sometime afternoon.  When do those idiots get to work?  Yeah.  Get the fuck to work.  Do they do a nine-to-fiver? 
[01:57:30]  I think the holder thing is ten.  Yeah.  That's, uh...  Yeah, but what?  To vote if a holder is in contempt of Congress.  Supreme Court, when do they get to their offices?  And how long does it take to get their robes on?  Yeah, they don't even really have to get dressed.  They can just fucking...  It's the big day, they're all going to be on camera and shit, and, eh, they just keep  the robe on.  They just keep it on?  Doesn't even matter.  You think they're nude underneath?  Nude.  What's the proper wear underneath?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Sweatpants?  I'd go sweatpants. 
[01:58:00]  Crotchless panties.  Fucking Troy.  With your balls hanging out.  Gotta be in jeans every day because of Troy Kwan.  What's wrong with me?  Yeah, right?  I miss my fucking sweatpants.  He really did get on your case about your dress.  He sure did.  Your work attire.  He sure did.  He sure did.  What?  He sure see-through shirts.  People expect to see you in blue jeans.  Have some pride.  It was more of the Steve Platter telling me to pull my sweatpants up that really got  to me.  I'm like, fuck.  I gotta be respected.  And took in those goddamn pajamas. 
[01:58:30]  I gotta be respected.  Yeah.  Troy Kwan's wearing see-through shirts, I guess is the big rumor around here.  Is that what he does now?  He was wearing it yesterday.  I didn't notice.  Is he showing nipple?  Did you notice?  Yeah.  How do you notice shit like that?  Well, I looked at him and I could see his chest and torso and back.  You said you could see his tattoos through his shirt?  You could absolutely see his tattoos through his shirt.  Why is that?  His hairy nipples?  He was wearing it.  Does he have puffy nipples?  They're puffy.  He's sensitive about them, though.  Are they pierced?  No, they were pierced and they were then ripped out. 
[01:59:00]  So why is he sensitive about his nipples?  Because now they protrude a little bit and he's sensitive about that.  So why doesn't he wear a t-shirt underneath his shirts?  Because it's see-through.  Troy a hipster.  He wants it to be see-through?  Yeah, a little sexy.  Is Troy a hipster?  Yeah, but I think that he definitely is a hipster.  Him and Sal are both hipsters.  Sal's a hipster, too?  What makes Sal a hipster?  Because he thinks Creep by Radiohead is not a good song.  Oh, God.  That's a hipster.  All right.  He goes to a Radiohead concert and says he doesn't want to hear them play Creep. 
[01:59:30]  That's such a-  When people say that, that's such a lie.  It's horse shit.  Let me tell you something.  When you like a band, you absolutely want to hear their hits.  Radiohead-  You want to hear some deeper shit and some experimental shit?  Yes.  But you want the whole fucking package.  Radiohead is a bunch of cunts, first of all.  They don't play this shit.  And let me tell you something.  We went to a Radiohead show.  Went to Roseland, saw Radiohead.  If they started playing this, that place would come the fuck apart.  Right.  Unglued.  Do you think all the fucking fans would sit there and go, you'd hear like a collective- 
[02:00:00]  Oh.  They would lose their minds.  They would be like, yeah, they played Creep.  When they played, where was it?  Roseland?  Yeah.  When they played Roseland, did they play Creep?  Because I know I had to leave early.  No.  They don't play it.  They never play it.  Why?  Because they're too cool.  Why wouldn't they embrace this song?  This song is amazing.  Because they're assholes.  And Sal thinks it's not one of their better songs.  Oh, God.  What is he like?  I don't know.  I like that other radio hit.  I don't know enough Radiohead to discuss this, I guess.  What was the other Radiohead hit that they kind of had? 
[02:00:30]  Thick Plastic Tree.  Karma Police.  Karma Police.  Oh, you like the Karma Police?  They never play Karma Police either.  No.  They never play the Karma Police.  Karma Police is great.  Sal.  Karma Police.  Sal, admit that you just say that shit to be cool.  I just want to be cool.  Why wouldn't you?  Oh, this is crazy.  No, I'm being honest.  Why wouldn't you want to hear Creep?  You're lying.  Let me tell you something.  Place full of the hardest core fucking Radiohead fans.  They start hearing this intro to Karma Police.  They're not losing their fucking minds. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, they're going to fucking lose it.  Yeah, motherfucker.  They absolutely would.  What's their logic, not playing Karma Police and the Creep?  I think they've just played it so many times.  Oh, too fucking bad.  How about they go back to the days when they were trying to make it and struggling and realize  that those songs fucking allow them to buy mansions.  Beach Boys are still singing good vibrations.  Exactly.  Much to Brian Wilson's chagrin.  He doesn't want that batting around a beach ball, apparently.  Radiohead does, what, two-hour concerts? 
[02:01:30]  They're on stage at least two hours, right?  So they can't handle five to ten minutes of hits?  McCartney sings Let It Be.  Yeah.  And he's still putting out new music.  That's like McCartney going, you know what?  I've played Yesterday so much, I'm just not going to play it anymore.  I fucking hate bands that are too cool for the room.  They're rolling fucking stones.  Fuck these bands.  And then Sal would be like, wow, Yesterday is not really a good song anyway.  But Sal.  Too cool for the room.  Sal, I think you're bullshitting yourself.  How so?  If you're on a Radiohead show and they play Creep, you're going to sit there and go, 
[02:02:00]  oh, God, why are they doing this?  No, no, no.  Because Tom York has even said he's played it so many times he hates it, blah, blah, blah.  Well, you know what?  It's not about him.  It's about the people that paid to go to the fucking show.  That self-serving cocksucker.  He is.  Well, how about he takes some money off the ticket price because they're not going to hear Creep  in Corbin, please.  Yeah.  No, I'm not even joking.  We're going to throw some shit in front of you.  You might like it.  You might not.  Hey, great.  Thanks.  Look, Neil Young is a cunt, but he tells you ahead of time, I'm a cunt and I'm not playing  any classic Neil Young songs. 
[02:02:30]  You're not going to hear Cinnamon Girl, you fuckers.  But he'll tell you.  Yeah.  You know, up front, this is what I'm doing tonight.  I don't feel like playing my fucking hits.  So if you want to come, fair enough.  Look, I never said you shouldn't play it live.  I mean, you said it wasn't a good song.  I just don't like the song that much.  How do you not like the song?  It's okay.  I just heard it so many times.  It's like diluted.  What song brought you to Radiohead?  Probably like Paranoid Android.  That whole fucking album.  Kid A.  Sorry.  Kid A.  Not Kid A.  Kid A is a phenomenal album.  What do I mean?  Okay Computer. 
[02:03:00]  Okay Computer.  No, Pablo probably sucks.  But Okay Computer is a phenomenal album.  What about the Benz?  The Benz?  That's my favorite Radiohead album.  Planet Telex.  All those fucking songs.  Black Star.  Black Star.  I love Black Star.  That is a fucking phenomenal album.  Fake Plastic Trees.  Fake Plastic Trees.  Yep.  Come on.  This is great.  It really is.  I've heard just before I'm in it.  I lost myself.  I lost myself. 
[02:03:30]  Everybody.  And he's singing about himself.  Before I'm in it.  For a decade.  I lost myself.  For a decade.  I lost myself.  It's great.  And by the way.  It's a good song.  It's a good song.  This song rolls.  It's a sound mister I've heard.  You don't want to hear Karma Police either?  No.  Karma Police.  I would love Karma.  And why don't they play that?  Yeah.  You guys that have to be too cool for the room.  I think it's all bullshit.  I really don't.  He hasn't heard Creep too many times.  He was seven when the song came out.  He was seven years old. 
[02:04:00]  He was seven?  Yes.  I was born in 90.  Were you?  So do you?  Wow.  You were born in 90?  I was.  It's crazy.  Wow.  He was.  Really?  Seven when the song came out.  Oh boy.  That's awkward.  How old are you?  I'm 22.  I just turned 22.  22.  Congratulations.  Oh, thank you. 
[02:04:30]  You don't like Creep?  Come on.  No, it's a good song.  It's just, it's diluted itself.  Yeah, but he.  All right.  Maybe he doesn't play it every night.  Maybe.  They don't play it every night.  But at least throw it in there.  They don't play it every night.  I know they don't.  That's the whole discussion we're having.  That should be the fucking encore every fucking night.  Every concert they do, they should play this song.  This should be all of them.  Why is Tom York such an asshole?  Because his ego is.  He's a frustrated genius.  His ego is immense.  Oh, the delicate genius.  Yeah, he's a genius who puts out genius songs and then doesn't play them. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Great.  Thanks.  This guy is saying they do play Creep, they just haven't in a while, knows why they don't  play it anymore.  You want to take our first phone call of the day?  This guy will be talking out his asshole.  Let's hear him up.  Dickhead.  Everyone would be upset if Zeppelin didn't play Stairway to Heaven, but when they do play  it, people flip out.  What?  They don't play it anymore.  Sorry.  I don't think they're playing it anymore.  I don't think Zeppelin plays that when they tour.  Let's say hi to Jose in Vegas.  Hey, Jose.  What's up, Beaner?  Beaner.  How will it be going? 
[02:05:30]  What's up?  Listen, the last time that they played it was in 2009 at the Reading Festival.  And the reason why they don't play it is because they played it every single night for a good  maybe, I don't know, eight or nine years.  Yeah, it's called a hit song.  Big fucking deal.  Yeah.  Oh, they did.  Oh.  That was their, but they got so many other hit songs, but that's the one that everybody  just wants.  They're not giving people what they want.  Does it pain them to play the song?  If I wrote Creep, I would play it every day of my life. 
[02:06:00]  Remember this song?  Remember?  I wrote this, guys.  Remember this?  Yeah, yeah.  This is me.  That's me.  I wrote it.  I mean, yeah.  I mean, it was a good song, but like, if you had to play it every single night, I mean,  it gets monotonous.  Oh, does it?  Oh, wow.  No one gets monotonous being a plumber every fucking day.  Play Creep.  Yeah.  I don't fix toilets because I spent eight years fixing toilets.  I only do sinks.  You know how easy their lives are?  You fucking play Creep.  It's three, and I think it's barely three minutes, right?  Yeah.  Three fucking minutes out of their night of touring. 
[02:06:30]  Let's call it three and a half minutes.  But I'm not saying they shouldn't play the hits.  They do play a lot of their hits.  They play their self-indulgent.  No.  But I just don't prefer the song.  It's self-indulgent.  They do not play it.  It absolutely is, because they're trying to be all artsy and put on a performance.  Why don't you prefer the song?  What's the problem with Creep?  It's just...  It's so...  Too simple?  Bland.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  I don't even like Radiohead, and this is an amazing song.  It's a good song, but I've heard it so many times.  We're going to play...  E-Rock, we've got to play Homeless Mustard doing Creep.  That was an amazing day.  Oh, God.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  His affected voice.  Oh, you've turned the corner on the mustard?  Hate mustard.  Oh, my God.  I definitely...  Everything's coming out today.  That's a one-hit one.  It's mustard.  I like his version of Creep.  Thank you.  Oh, wait.  Let's go to Coke Logic before we get Troy Kwan on the discussion.  Troy...  Coke Logic, excuse me.  Coke.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  How are you? 
[02:07:30]  I'm good.  I'm just trying to hear this dance, singing, and Radiohead and all that stuff.  Right.  You guys aren't, like, the whole expression, man, they used to be so much better back when.  Yeah, we've heard that a few times.  Exactly.  Yeah, we hear that, unfortunately.  Look, it's not our fault.  Come on.  The whole business has changed.  Lawyers got in the way.  Listen to fucking the real whole shows back in the day.  They sucked.  We had one or two good bits a day, maybe.  That's true, though.  And the whole show was just us fucking babbling and playing music. 
[02:08:00]  Well, what I'm saying is...  We should play one of them on the lead.  Entirely.  One show in its entirety.  I think we could turn a lot of people around.  Oh, my God.  Why are they playing this three times in one show?  Jesus, Anthony.  Was that Reagan bit so good that you had to play it three times?  Yes, it was, Mommy.  You had to work some girls.  I mean, you know.  I was busy smoking and drinking beer in the studio.  All right.  All right.  Playing foosball during commercial breaks.  Chapter four.  That was great. 
[02:08:30]  Coke Logic.  You hate that shit, too, right?  Yeah.  It's played out.  Like, I have a lot of bootlegs where I can just go and listen to it whenever I want.  It's played up until, like, 2009.  Sneak-a-legs.  Yeah.  Double wide.  Think of the latest radiohead stuff, like fucking King of Limbs or 15 Step.  Yeah.  If you listen to that stuff, they have so many great songs that they can fill a concert.  They played two hours and ten minutes here in Chicago a couple weeks. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Did they play fucking Creep?  No.  No.  And blew the shit up.  Gives a shit.  They're going to put on a really good show for you.  I agree.  Not as good as it could be.  But every once in a while, you just throw it in there.  Drunk tech didn't think it was that good.  Jesus.  Yeah.  What happened there?  Oh, someone pulled the wrong pin.  Jack White does some kind of version of Seven Nation Army at almost every show.  Seven Nation Army.  Sometimes he rushes through it because you can tell he doesn't feel like doing it, but he still does it. 
[02:09:30]  And everybody flips the fuck out.  Every artist that has a hit song, I don't give a shit if it's 20 fucking years, you gotta play it.  People want to hear it.  Maybe there are people at that show that never fucking heard you do it live.  Right.  Right.  You're playing to them.  Or someone like me that's like, oh, the Creep Guys.  Yeah.  Do you want a pork pie hat?  A pork pie hat?  Yeah.  One of those little fucking hipster hats.  No.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Don't fucking go crazy.  Wait, what hat is that? 
[02:10:00]  That's that hipster.  It's not the beach hat?  The little one.  There's a little one now?  Nah, it's like, it's too small to be a hat.  Let me see.  One of those.  That's like Ska Band shit.  Yeah, that one.  The straw one.  Look at, look at.  Right there.  I hate that hat.  He'll be wearing this hat within six months probably.  Troy, you don't wear those hats, right?  No, I don't.  Those are in every commercial now where they're just like showing the hipster guys hanging out.  So one of them has always got that dumb hat.  They're played out.  And big mutton chop sideburns, to be ironic.  They're played out.  Shut up. 
[02:10:30]  All right, Coke Logic.  Thanks for, um...  It's had to look great with a bullet hole in it.  Thanks for, um...  Bleeding hipster under it.  Thanks for, um...  Oh, yeah, for...  For this.  Obviously, he's a big Radiohead fan.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So are you a big Radiohead fan?  On the space shuttle!  You're going on the space shuttle to see Radiohead play Creed!  First person in space!  Nice.  I love that to this day.  Splits in Indiana.  What's up, Splits? 
[02:11:00]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Listen, I never was a big Neil Young fan.  But, you know, I just heard you guys say that he sucked.  I don't know why you guys dislike him.  But I was coming down to New York...  Hold on a minute.  I love Neil Young.  But everyone would admit, a lot of people would admit, he gets a bit cunty with his own fans.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But at least he'll tell you up front, this is what I'm doing.  Tough shit.  That's my point.  Well, I was coming down a New Jersey turnpike back in, like, the early to mid-80s. 
[02:11:30]  Fascinating.  And there was a tour bus, and the satellite dish on the top of the bus was blowing loose,  and it was almost hitting the overpasses.  I flagged the bus down, and we got off into one of the service plazas and, you know, told  him about it.  Well, they couldn't get up there, so I pulled my track and railed.  Where did he lose you?  Holy fuck.  Where did he lose you?  I need to know.  He lost me at the satellite dish waving around, and they pulled the bus over. 
[02:12:00]  Where is this going?  Well, he promised me I'd fix the thing.  I got up and fixed it, and they got me tickets and all to go to the show.  Couldn't you just say...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Couldn't you just say, I did a favor for some guy, and I got tickets to the show?  We don't care what was wrong with...  I don't give a shit!  Wait, what was wrong with the bus again?  Yeah, the satellite dish was waving around or something.  Oh.  And so you bolted down a satellite dish, and you got free tickets for that? 
[02:12:30]  So it was actually...  I had a three-quarter inch crescent wrench, but it wasn't fitting.  So I had to actually get my sockets set out, and...  Yeah!  Then what?  He hung up.  I swear, that wasn't me.  Good.  He should have been at the show in Canada.  Borefest!  Fuck!  Travis just said Pearl Jam plays even flow like every show.  I saw the set list.  Yeah.  But you know what I didn't see on it?  What?  Jeremy.  They don't play Jeremy?  I didn't see it on the fucking...  Yeah, but...  The most amazing, as Travis called it, the most awesome fucking Pearl Jam set list ever. 
[02:13:00]  Ever.  Where was it?  Can I see the most amazing Pearl Jam set ever?  Yeah.  But see, those guys...  It did look good, but there was no Jeremy.  Those guys will mix it up, though.  But you gotta play Jeremy.  I think you gotta play Jeremy every show.  Look, Pearl Jam has...  I think you gotta.  Pearl Jam has a lot of hits, especially for the fans, but then there's the hits that,  like, only the casual fan knows.  They gotta play all those.  Mm-hmm.  You gotta.  Just gotta mix it up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeremy is the sixth most played Pearl Jam song alive.  Sixth most played?  Wait, they keep track of what songs they play the most.  And Even Flow is number one, as it should be, and Creep should be number one.  And Alive is number two, and Black is number three.  There you go.  This list is perfect.  Porch, four.  Corduroy, five.  Jeremy, six.  Then you go Daughter, number seven.  Better Man, number eight.  See, they're playing all the stuff people do know. 
[02:14:30]  Do the Evolution, number nine, and the tenth most played song at a Pearl Jam show, Rearview Mirror.  Where's my elderly woman behind the counter in a small town?  Oh, I hate that one.  I love that song.  I hate that song.  I love that song.  It's a bit wordy in the title, but I love the song.  Yellow, what better I love?  What's their most, let's go to the bottom of the list.  What songs they don't play a lot?  It's usually, when you get down there, it's usually covers and stuff. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Like, where's, like, Just Breathe?  That's probably got to be somewhat.  I love Just Breathe.  I mean, obviously, it hasn't been throughout their career, but I'm sure they've played a lot.  What about Red Mosquito?  72 is Just Breathe.  Red Mosquito.  Where's the Red Mosquito?  How many times they play that?  More than Just Breathe.  Yeah, it's tied for 65.  Yeah.  Not bad.  That's kind of cool.  Where's the awesome set list? 
[02:15:30]  Which set list?  What day was it?  Travis said he found the ultimate world jam set list.  It's in Travis's Twitter.  Travis's tweeter.  He posted it.  Or retweeted somebody that did it, right?  This guy did a little math for us, man, and I really appreciate rock underscore eight underscore 13.  There it is.  I will never follow you.  It's too complicated.  Sorry, sir.  If Radiohead played Creep once every day for four years, it would be 73 hours. 
[02:16:00]  Uh-huh.  Not even 40 hours a week of factory work.  Oh.  See?  Fuckers.  Lazy cock.  There's the amazing Pearl Jam.  Now, uh-  That was great.  This was last night in Amsterdam.  Where's Jeremy?  It's not on there.  Why?  You don't have to play it every night.  Yes, they do.  You need the Jeremy.  No, no, no.  We need the Jeremy.  It's Creep Rule.  Creep Rule.  No.  It's the Creep Rule.  Uh-oh.  No, and they didn't go even flow.  No, even flow.  No, I didn't.  And they didn't do it live.  Let me. 
[02:16:30]  And they didn't do just Breeze.  And they didn't do elderly woman behind the counter in a small town.  This list sucks.  This list was done by a fan who won, like, this contest.  They found the ten oldest fan club members, like, who have been around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This would be great because I would not have to learn the words.  I could just do it.  So what is Travis trying to say with this?  So they found old Pearl Jam fans.  Yeah.  So they found the ten people who are still active ten club members and have been around the 
[02:17:30]  longest, and they gave one of them a trip to Amsterdam, and he curated the set list.  Curated.  He got to pick the songs.  Yeah.  This was his set list.  And he has to go, no alive, no even flow, no elderly woman behind the counter in a small  town.  Yes.  No, this is not the OB set list.  No red mosquito.  No even flow?  No even flow.  Are you shitting me?  Come on, Travis.  You know what?  Come on.  If I was going to make a set list, I'd leave even flow out too.  What?  Because I've heard it and re-show. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, here he goes again.  Oh, here he goes again.  Everyone's heard it too much.  Would you put elderly woman behind the counter in a small town?  I hate that one.  Maybe.  What about a little Just Breathe when he slows it down a little bit?  No.  You don't like Just Breathe?  No.  No.  He loves that song way too much.  I see Alive in there.  Hasn't that been played alive?  Ever.  Yeah.  Would you leave that out?  Yes.  No.  No, I'd play Alive.  So what's the difference between that and Even Flow?  Wait, where is Alive?  He did play Alive?  Yeah, it's in the Encore.  Oh, I didn't see the Encore.  Bob O'Reilly.  Yeah, they do Bob O'Reilly a lot. 
[02:18:30]  Bugs.  This was like the second time they've ever played Bugs.  Oh, good for them.  Bugs.  Yeah.  Give the fuck.  Bugs was off Vitalogy.  I don't even know if I know that song.  Yeah, you do.  How's it go?  Give me Bugs.  Play Bugs.  I don't even know if it's in the system.  They creep up on you.  No.  Yes, they do.  It's probably in profit.  Matthew might be in profit.  Oh, so it's so popular.  No, it's not popular.  That's not even fucking.  Oh, then leave it off the list and play Jeremy for fuck's sake.  It's more of a joke song.  Is it?  Yeah.  But that makes people excited when they break that out and play it in concert?  Yeah, because up until two years ago, they'd never played it live before. 
[02:19:00]  I got Bugs.  It's just not a song you play live.  I don't got Bugs.  Here's Bugs from Pearl Jam from Vitalogy.  Oh, this sounds great already.  I'm not saying it's the best song.  I'm saying it's interesting to hear live.  I've heard this on Pearl Jam.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Leave Evenflow out for this.  Oh, yeah.  That makes sense.  I would fucking be running to take a piss.  That's what everyone does when Evenflow comes on.  Oh, stop.  Everybody here. 
[02:19:30]  They do not.  Evenflow is your beer piss song.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  No, it's not.  You fucking, you fan.  Not for you.  I'm telling you from experience, being a person that has never been to a Pearl Jam show, I  guarantee they're singing.  You are out of your mind.  That's a sing-along song.  You don't think a stadium full of fucking people are sitting there and watching Pearl Jam do  one of their hugest hits, or they're all going to file out to do the bathroom, and they're  hanging out for this with rock and roll fucking fingers up in the air.  I'm admittedly in a different class than that. 
[02:20:00]  Whoa.  No, I'm not saying that to you.  You're a Pearl Jam snob.  Troy, thank you.  That was great.  You're a Pearl Jam snob.  No, I'm just saying, like, anything, if you've heard something a dozen times, you're going  to go take a piss when you hear it again, you know?  That place would be on its feet.  Give me some live...  Here we go.  Find me Live Evenflow by Pearl Jam on fucking YouTube, and let's see the crowd reaction when 
[02:20:30]  it starts.  Oh, wow.  We can call it out on it.  Let's watch the people file out and go get beers and take pisses.  How about Madison Square Garden?  All right, that's a good venue.  What year, though?  What year?  Two years ago?  I was at that show.  All right, that's fair enough.  Two years ago.  Here we go.  All right, let's hear it.  So this song's been around a long time by now.  Let's hear it.  It's not like when it first came out.  Shut up!  30,000 people don't go to get a beer.  Shut up!  I want to hear.  I was older than two years.  Ready?  Seven years.  Shut it.  Pardon my manners. 
[02:21:00]  I forgot to say hello and good evening.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  You've got to say hello and good evening.  I like it.  Fuck it.  It's the best.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  I'm not a fan of his talking between songs.  It's getting a little wordy.  It's gotten better.  It's getting better.  Well, since Bush left office.  How many of you have manners in New York City?  How the fuck you doing?  How the fuck you doing?  What is he drinking?  His own wine. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  The Pearl Jam wine.  Yeah, he makes his own wine.  Is it good?  Have you tried it?  No, he doesn't sell it.  He doesn't sell it?  No, it's his own wine.  It's a part of us if we felt like we had a bit of a job to do tonight.  But we're glad to hear it.  And thanks, everyone.  It's nice to see you.  Uh-huh.  Oh, it's nice to see you, too, Eddie.  It really makes you feel welcome.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  They're all bouncing.  They're all smiling out.  They're all bouncing.  Everyone's bouncing.  Their hands are up in the air.  This is crazy. 
[02:22:00]  Oh.  They hate it.  Oh, wait a minute.  Look.  There's Travis walking away.  I see Travis walking toward the bathroom.  Oh, look at them all bouncing.  Oh, my God.  You know why?  Because I don't want to miss what might be next.  Oh, my God.  What, that fucking piece of shit, Bugs?  I would so watch Bugs.  Bugs sounds like they drop their instruments on I-beams.  I hate it. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Everyone's singing along now.  Watch.  Yeah.  We should watch the whole thing.  No problem here.  He sounds great.  He's amazing.  He really does.  You don't listen to the Pearl Jam channel?  It's great.  No.  It's great.  You got to go next time there.  He does sound great.  When are they coming around again?  Probably next year.  Fuck.  I blew it.  I could have won last time.  You can go to their thing in Philly in September. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, you know what?  I got a connection for that.  Yeah, they're doing Jay-Z's festival.  Why do they even continue playing the song when there's nobody left in the audience?  Travis, they all just walked away.  Integrity.  Integrity.  Where are you sure?  Let's go back to the ultimate service.  I love it.  What makes it the ultimate set list from the super fan?  There's just...  I like Animal.  It's a good mix of stuff you never hear, like Alone and Footsteps off Lost Dogs.  They don't play that. 
[02:23:30]  I know Footsteps.  Oh, good.  I don't know I Got Shit, though.  I want to hear shit they don't play.  Yeah, you do.  I do.  Yeah.  That was from...  I do?  Yeah, that was I Got It from the EP that they did with Neil Young.  Oh, so why are they called I Got Shit?  I don't know.  I want to hear songs I know.  I know I Got It.  I want to hear the hits.  You know Daughter?  Yeah, I like Daughter.  You know Animal?  Love Animal.  You know Dissident?  Love Dissident.  Which I've never seen live.  Love Better Man.  Better Man.  I play Better Man every night. 
[02:24:00]  I love that.  Glorify G, I love.  Glorify G.  Yeah, but they don't have the elderly woman.  You can't do everything.  Wait, elderly woman?  Behind the counter in a small town.  Yeah.  You can't do everything.  I love that song.  Release?  Release is a great song.  Release is a great song. 
[02:24:30]  I like this.  I love the hits.  You'd have a great time at a show.  No, the hits.  I need the hits.  I love the hits.  You'd have a great time.  You're more of a silver chair fan.  I don't think so. 
[02:25:00]  You're like silver chair.  Hot boy.  Hot boy.  We're in tomorrow.  What, Crown of Thorns?  Crown of Thorns?  All right.  That's a fucking, uh, what?  Mother Love Bone.  Yeah.  I love when we do it.  Look at us harmonizing.  Of course.  We're fucking harmonizing.  That's great.  As long as you ever ask me for the words, I can fucking give you the fucking feel of the song. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, you don't have to know the words.  It's great.  I like when they do Temple of the Dog stuff.  Ever do that?  And I like when they do some of that Mother Love Bone.  You know who plays the hits?  Soundgarden plays the fucking hits.  Yeah.  They know what got them to the fucking party. 
[02:26:00]  Like I said, the Rolling Stones, even, they've been playing that shit for 800 years.  I mean.  They still fucking play it.  You know what?  Yeah.  I'm going to have to side with Travis on this one.  There's enough fucking hits in this set list.  There's plenty of hits in the set list.  Look, I would want.  It ain't Radiohead.  I understand.  But Jeremy should be in this.  I swear to God, the only song I want to hear is elderly woman, behind a counter in a small  time.  I fucking love it.  And it's a sing-along song, too.  It is not a sing-along.  Yes, it is.  What is?  What?  No.  The whole fucking place goes, hello. 
[02:26:30]  That's true.  No, go live.  Go live so you can hear the hello part.  What are you doing, Eric?  No, go to Sam's part.  Get it from the same garden show because they have a good quality live thing going on.  When he gets to the hello part and the whole place goes hello, it brings chills.  What is this, Rocky Horror?  Elderly woman, not grandmother.  Oh, God.  How old were you when that came out?  Elderly woman is a grandmother, but it's not the name of the song.  Jeez Louise.  This is like a dirge. 
[02:27:00]  I don't like this.  This one.  You like this one?  Yeah.  Is this the Madison Square Garden one again?  This is in Brazil.  It's how powerful.  They're all going to the bathroom.  What happened?  They're all singing.  I like that he sounds just like the record.  Sounds exactly the same.  Yeah, it's good.  How does his voice hold up?  I don't know.  He plays a lot of shows.  I get three hours.  That's so unbelievable. 
[02:27:30]  Just the hello part.  That's what we're waiting for here.  The many hairstyles are very better, by the way.  It's long.  It's short.  What else is going on?  He's crazy.  He is.  Here we go.  I wish I'd seen the place, but no one's ever taken me.  That's fine.  He's a rock star, though. 
[02:28:00]  He's a rock star.  He's a rock star.  He's a rock star.  Definitely.  No denying that one.  It's only laser. 
[02:28:30]  You and recall.  We're not right.  Oh.  Here we go.  You're stuck upon the shell.  Now we're just listening.  Fuck it.  Yeah, I know, right?  Okay.  It's like we're back at that.  Yeah.  Oh, baby.  Oh.  That's what no one's gonna save me 
[02:29:00]  No one's gonna save me  No  Oh my God, it's been too long  And I know where you're facing  And I'm here who you are  And here I am  Thoughts and thoughts fade, fade away 
[02:29:30]  Thoughts and thoughts fade, fade, fade away  How about this song, Fades Away?  Now what do we want to listen to?  Look at Travis.  This is fun.  Travis loves this.  It's kind of fun.  You don't like the last kiss cover?  He did a great job with that though. 
[02:30:00]  That was an unintentional hit.  You know what he needs to do though is mix up his covers.  You think he does what, too much who?  Well on the Pearl Jam channel I feel like I hear the same covers over and over again.  A lot of Bob O'Reilly  They like doing a lot of Who  A lot of Who  You know, he's obsessed with  I'm trying to think what else  They have a great cover of I Got a Feeling  I got a great cover of I Got a Feeling  He's done  He's done Imagine 
[02:30:30]  He's done  He's done some John Lennon stuff  Why is Troy Kwan in here?  I forgot  Because I was going to comment on Hipsters  Radiohead  I can comment on Hipsters too  Oh Radiohead?  But then he moved on to Pearl Jam and I left and he made me feel bad for walking out  You could comment on Radiohead  Are you one of those guys that have to go completely the other way and if they play Creep you're like  Oh man, what a waste of folks  No, if I saw Radiohead I'd love to see Creep  Of course  I mean that's a great song  I don't know how you could not think that's a great song  Exactly  I mean that doesn't make any sense to me  If you're a fan of the band 
[02:31:00]  Right  I don't like it  Just a fan of like 90's rock  It's one of the best rock songs  When you become a fan of a band  There's like  Let's call it five songs that are given  That every fan should just enjoy  And then you go off from there  The problem with the Radiohead is  The problem with the Radiohead is  I'm trying to talk all Anthony's singing is that you're doing  You want a good sing-along crawl down video? 
[02:31:30]  Give me a good one  Oh shut up  Oh where oh where can the funny be?  Go blow me  You know what?  Goodbye  You don't like it you get bounced  That's how that works  Bye  Bye  Not everything's hilarious  We're talking about fucking music  We're talking about shit  Don't like it lump it  Oh better man's a sing-along song yeah  This is a really good one  It's a really good one  Yeah  I'm not a big fan of better man  This is the one that was in the documentary 
[02:32:00]  I hated the documentary  That was great  And he didn't give up enough  It's obvious he doesn't really like his band anymore  Right enough of this song  I mean they just understand each other  But they don't hang out at all  Oh boy  You don't want to see this live  If it's for the  I need  To get to  I need  What?  Oh  Oh  No we paid you, you sing the song  No this is great 
[02:32:30]  They're all singing from the bathroom  I'm not a fan when I have to do your job  I'm not a fan when I have to do your job  I'm not a fan when I have to do your job  No I don't like this really  This is great  He should sing along too though  He will  He will  It's pretty cool  Fucking sing the song itself give yourself 
[02:33:00]  That must be insane though you're standing there and people are just singing your dumb shit  That you wrote on a bus or something one day and yeah fast-forward they're all singing it  I'd love to be on the stage  We're making fun. That's cool shit here people yelling. Hey, Masturbator 
[02:33:30]  What now what happens what happens now that's and yeah, what is that? Well, how about we start that boy?  He got a little choked up. He got choked up. Come on. Why is that the first time that happened?  Thank you. No, this is just a really good one. Why though? What was going on? Did you hear how loud it was?  Oh 
[02:34:00]  To herself there's no one else who needs to know  Okay, let's let's get a break with this  That sounds pretty fucking guys  Memories  Memories back when she was smooth and strong and waiting for the world to come along 
[02:34:30]  Says she'd do and she says it's over  She lies and says she's in love with you  Can't find a better man  She dreams in color  She dreams in color  She dreams in red  Can't find a better man  She lies and says she's still a little bit  Can't find a better man  She dreams in color  She dreams in red  Can't find a better man 
[02:35:00]  Can't find a better man  Can't find a better man  Can't find a better man  She loves him  She don't want to leave his place  She beats him  So I should be back again 
[02:35:30]  Can't find a better man  Can't find a better man  Can't find a better man  Can't find a better man  Yeah, yeah  Oh, oh, oh, oh 
[02:36:00]  Oh, oh, oh  Oh  We'll be right back. 
[02:36:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:37:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:37:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:38:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:38:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:39:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:39:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:40:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:40:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:41:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:41:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:42:00]  That sounds like commercial bed music.  It does.  That's commercial bed music.  What is everyone doing for the 4th of July?  What an odd 4th and falling on a Wednesday.  Very difficult to decide.  Do you do the before weekend party?  Do you do the after weekend party?  You definitely do the 4th and the 4th and the 4th and the 4th and the 4th and the 4th and the 4th and the 4th of July, because once it's over, how do you have a party for something after it's done? 
[02:42:30]  I got a two-year-old's birthday party going to, so I will not be doing the pre-4th of July party.  Oh, man.  And I'm also still trying to get a goddamn summer house.  Help me out, man.  Oh, what do they do?  Who's got a nice house?  Little Ocean View.  Hamptons.  Point Pleasant, New Jersey would be nice.  Point Pleasant, New Jersey.  Come on, help me out. 
[02:43:00]  Put something on my Facebook page or something.  I'm desperate.  I'm desperate.  I remember this was supposed to be the summer of the summer house and the party.  Summer of George!  Oh, fuck!  Someone help me out!  OP Radio fans on Facebook.  What?  Why don't you just get one?  Because we're finding shitty houses and shitty situations.  You know what?  You really got to think this out early.  And then some asshole goes, oh, I got a lady you got to talk to in the Hamptons.  And she's trying to rent me houses that are $100,000 a month.  I don't... 
[02:43:30]  Well, I do, but I don't want to pay.  No.  It's crazy.  It's crazy, right?  You got to get in earlier.  You got to start looking at fucking April, right?  They're a little desperate now because there's some empty houses out there.  Yeah.  Point Pleasant, kind of close to the boardwalk, a little ocean view.  Maybe go Long Beach Island.  Help me out.  Somebody.  Not too quiet.  Not some of these quiet towns where there's nothing to do.  Hey, have you heard that woman?  I don't want to walk into a nice town that has some shit going on.  What?  That woman talking about no bikinis on the boardwalk?  Do you have her audio? 
[02:44:00]  Oh.  It's fucking...  Where's that?  It's like she's from the 1800s.  What town is trying to say that?  It's Ashbury.  Ashbury Park, right there.  You know what happens in that area?  Ashbury?  That's the least of their worries.  I'm not from Jersey.  Ashbury Park.  Ashbury.  You're from Florida.  There's audio of her that is...  Wait, what?  Is she trying to ban bikinis on the boardwalk?  She doesn't want bikinis on the boardwalk.  Why?  Because she has tiny tits?  I don't know.  She must be a fucking disaster.  Probably has little fucking mosquito bites.  Yeah.  When I heard her fucking going off on this, she sounded like one of these old prudy... 
[02:44:30]  Well, Sam will have the audio within seconds.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's good news.  He's so good on the internet.  He's so good.  Look at him go.  He's getting...  That feeling.  ...still pictures and text.  There's nothing.  No video.  No nothing.  Swimsuits not allowed on Asbury Park boardwalk.  Oh, what's that loading?  A news thing.  Maybe not her at all.  That's true.  It's got to be her audio.  God, I hope it's not her now.  Let's hear the story. 
[02:45:00]  Let's find out.  All right.  Oh, boy, loading.  Your video will start in 15 seconds.  14 seconds.  This isn't the lady, Sam.  This is an advertisement.  It's people on a bus.  A guy puts a bag down.  Don't assume it was left by accident.  If you see something, say something.  See something, say something.  ...and knew this half hour.  Cover up or you want to pay up.  That's a push tonight in a city along the Jersey Shore where someone believes to enforce  a little-known law that requires cover-ups on the boardwalk. 
[02:45:30]  As you can imagine...  On their shitty boardwalk that they're trying to bring back.  ...is all wet.  New Jersey reporter Tony Yates is in Asbury Park.  Tony Yates.  Tony.  Oh, yay.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Asbury Park has been going through this...  I heard.  I heard.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  ...who believes that it's been going all the way back to the time...  Wow.  That was a little too close for comfort.  Could have been anything.  Yeah, she's more white than black.  We're good.  ...in a bathing suit.  Oh, my God.  I mean, obviously, we don't want people walking around nude. 
[02:46:00]  A thong.  Hipster hat.  ...carses could be...  ...dick.  ...a little bit out of line.  How about no bathing suits on the boardwalk in Asbury Park?  None.  Are you actively serious?  For what reason?  Asbury Park, former councilwoman Louise Mary...  They should have banned that couple before they banned the fucking bikinis.  ...to enforce an old dress code for the boardwalk law that is still on the books.  Is that her name?  It says wear appropriate cover-ups and shoes...  ...find Louise Mary's audio.  That's what you need.  ...90 days in jail or at least...  That's her. 
[02:46:30]  So copy-paste her stupid fuck name.  So Sam was wrong?  Yeah.  And we need her audio.  Oh, this guy has a place for me.  Can I go...  Can I do some...  You know...  Oh, please.  All right.  He's got a place for me.  His name's Anthony.  Anthony, you got a place for me?  No, Opie.  I don't.  Fuck.  Oh, shit.  No, I'm the other Anthony, Anthony.  What do you got?  What town are we talking about?  What town are we talking about?  I got a nice place for you up in Sound Beach.  You can have sugar sandwiches by the shore. 
[02:47:00]  What about Sight Beach?  That was double senses.  Chip is on vacation.  Remember?  Trying to hold down the fort.  Sound Beach.  Sound Beach.  Remember those days, Opie?  No.  Where's Sound Beach?  Come on.  Is that Waiting River?  Yeah.  Wow, this was a waste of time.  Oh, God.  Waiting River.  Thank you.  Come on.  What are you kidding?  Hey, you hear about the clams in Chinatown?  No.  What happened?  Oh, you got that audio? 
[02:47:30]  Oh, he's got this audio.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, this guy was talking on the phone.  I had the audio.  You hear about the clams?  You like clams, right?  Baked clams.  I don't like raw clams.  I love raw clams.  Eat this.  But Chinatown had bit in trouble because they discovered that they got some clams from Boston.  Yeah.  Shipped them to Chinatown here in New York.  Oh.  In crates.  No ice.  The whole way with no ice?  No ice.  Wow. 
[02:48:00]  So they're pretty much telling everyone, don't eat clams.  Those are some bad crams.  In the Chinatown area.  Wow.  Would you eat a clam that made it from Boston to New York without any ice?  Without ice?  Oh, my God.  In a fucking hot truck?  In a hot truck?  In a hot crate?  Wow, man.  That's bad.  Find that story next, Sam.  They don't care.  Because I don't want people to think I made that up.  But first, the bikini story.  Let's hear this woman's ranting.  Asbury Park.  You could not go on that boardwalk unless you had a cover-up and shoes. 
[02:48:30]  That was the law.  And it still is, but you wouldn't know it these days.  You really want to be sitting in a restaurant and seeing somebody come up half-dressed?  We all can't be Sports Illustrated.  As the city's Republican Party chair.  And we all can't be GQs.  Murray asked the council at a meeting last week to start enforcing the ban on baiting suits.  The window's obviously closed.  But even at my best day, I never walked in a bar in a baiting suit.  City manager Terry Reedy says they'll talk it over. 
[02:49:00]  Since it is a law in the book, that needs to be revisited.  Or else, says Murray.  We're going to end up like any other seedy boardwalk in some seashore town.  Alex Silverman, WCBS, APN.  Yeah.  I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, you probably couldn't.  God forbid you see a nice ass or some cleavage or whatnot.  Punch her up.  Get a picture of her.  Let's see what she looks like.  I bet you she's a looker.  Let's see what she looks like.  Images.  Images. 
[02:49:30]  Is that her?  Wow, she's not bad looking.  No, that's not her.  That's from Anaheim.  What was that?  Oh, you were close.  Yeah, that's Chris Murray from Anaheim.  Oh.  That's not her.  No.  That's Christy Weir.  Brett Weir.  Get me, Brett Weir, I said!  Mm-hmm.  Look, jerky, I don't need to talk to you.  Yeah, we need jerseys.  There's not even a picture of her?  That's how heinous she is?  Whoa.  Oh, okay.  Is that her on the right? 
[02:50:00]  I believe this to be her.  Holy shit.  Well, thank God she doesn't go out with a bathing suit on.  Well, dum-dums.  No shit.  She looks like the great kazoo.  She's got a kazoo haircut.  That's like a hair helmet.  That is weird, man.  She looks...  She's bizarre.  Yeah.  She's putting down a few beverages, though, huh?  Likes to fucking tip the glass a little bit, don't you?  Whoa, yeah.  You kill joy.  She probably sees these hot fucking girls walking around with bikinis on, and it kills her.  And it pisses her off.  It pisses her off that she wasn't blessed. 
[02:50:30]  Is she representing the people?  No.  She's not representing the people?  Representing her own insecurities.  I hear you.  Where's the clam story?  Not that it matters.  Fuck it.  Andy petted out with a broken ankle.  That could be his career, sir.  Six weeks out.  Oh, please.  Six weeks out.  That ball hit him pretty hard.  100 miles an hour, probably?  Jesus.  A little more, maybe?  Snap.  Poor bastard.  Wasn't he retired at one point?  What the fuck?  Yeah, he came back.  That's fucking...  Why do these ballplayers do that?  There you go. 
[02:51:00]  Chinatown clam scam.  Clam scam.  That's kind of clever.  Yeah, I like that.  Well, we're waiting, Sam.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Our cloud is not soft and fluffy.  Not clued.  It's not soft and fluffy, clued.  It's a hard moon frame clued.  Clued?  I can do some clued.  Clued.  I'm seeing Spider-Man tonight.  Put your photos up on the clued. 
[02:51:30]  Put your files on the clued.  Files on the clued.  I hate that motherfucker.  I'm seeing Spider-Man tonight.  You are?  After meditation class.  Spider-Man.  After meditation class.  Meditation class.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm taking a class.  Fuck you, Sam.  Clued.  Become a square-shaped clued.  Turn into a square-shaped clued.  What an asshole.  And I don't take no orders from no woman, by the way. 
[02:52:00]  By the way, I don't take no orders from no women.  I love it.  And I don't listen to women yelling.  I tell them to shut up.  And then this classic.  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  No, there isn't.  You dunce.  Turn into a square-shaped clued.  A square-shaped clued.  Yeah, I'm doing some meditation.  I'm doing some omen.  I might tape the omen tonight.  That movie's great.  Yeah.  That's the one with the kid.  What channel?  Damien?  What channel is that on? 
[02:52:30]  What channel are you taping the omen off of?  Damien?  The omen.  You said you're taping the omen tonight.  Yeah, the omen.  I love that.  Omen.  Are we airing two of them?  When that chick fucking hangs herself from the side of the building.  This is all for you, Damien.  Yeah.  Guy stuck under the ice, drowning and shit.  That's pretty creepy.  Fuck, Damien.  I'm going to broadcast live from my meditation class.  Are you?  Class.  Live broadcast.  Meditation.  I think I'm going to take away the purpose of it.  I know.  That's the beauty of it.  Well, it'll be a tape delay.  I'll use my SoundCloud or something. 
[02:53:00]  You're Sandkid.  Sound what?  Sandkid.  Sandkid.  We're going to go on the Sandkid.  Let's hear the clam fucking shit.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm going to hear these crazy goddamn Chinese people.  I'm going to have a Spider-Man review tomorrow.  I can't wait for that.  Town Fish Market was busted for selling dirty clams and untagged fish Tuesday afternoon.  The owner of Newland's Fish Market was arrested by authorities.  Hold on for a minute.  Wow.  Did you see that? 
[02:53:30]  Here in New York, we got ratings, restaurant ratings.  A through what?  A, B, C, D, F.  I don't know.  Isn't it just like regular grades or some shit?  And the shitty restaurants will try to hide their grade.  They hide the grade.  But that's even a fine.  Yeah, it's supposed to be prominently displayed.  Well, they'll make sure they put a plan or something in front of it.  Yeah, yeah.  I notice I only go to A-listed restaurants now.  It kind of does work.  Most of them get A's, though.  Most of them do get A's.  Because they know how important this is.  There have been other ones that say rating pending. 
[02:54:00]  They have that in the window.  I'm gone.  That means they found a cockroach or two.  I only go to the A's.  That one that they just showed, the place they're talking about, big B in the window.  B's not bad.  Yeah, it's a big drop off between A and B.  I go to B's.  B means they caught a cook shitting in the stew.  Wow, really?  Yeah, that's a B.  What about C, then?  Yuck.  C?  Oh, man.  Cockroaches?  He ate the stew with the shit in it and then puked it back up into the pot.  That's C.  And he's serving that. 
[02:54:30]  That's a C.  Don't get the stew.  Can you find a...  I want to know what a D-rated one is now.  What is D-rating?  I need to know.  Oh, man.  Actually, we need to know which one gets what letter for what reason, if that makes sense.  Yeah, what, what, what...  But first, the clam story, Sam.  What's the criteria?  Keep us on track.  What's wrong with you?  Restaurant rating criteria.  That's right.  After the clam story.  No matter and other hazardous bacteria.  Department of Environmental Conservation Police say the clams were illegally transported 
[02:55:00]  and kept in unrefrigerated burlap bags in the luggage areas of passenger buses.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  Holy.  They packed them in buses.  What kind of food poisoning did you get from that?  Oh, my God.  They packed them in the luggage of those buses.  So it wasn't even in the bus where you might get a little A.C. to keep them sort of cool.  What's that smell?  Exhaust is going through them.  Oh, man.  Holy fuck.  What's wrong with these people?  Burlap bags in the hot luggage compartment of fucking... 
[02:55:30]  Dude, you know some of these Chinese joints get a bad rap, but I'm telling you, and I  got to say it again.  There was a joint in Northport, and it's no longer there.  I am convinced that I was not eating chicken and that it had to be cat, pigeon, whatever  the fuck they substitute.  Cat just as good.  You know when you're eating something you're not supposed to be fucking eating, man.  Cartwright.  You know.  It was gamey.  I say Cartwright.  I say Cartwright not here. 
[02:56:00]  She say curse word.  Hang up.  Where's the rest of the story, Sam?  It's right here.  Letting you guys riff a little bit.  The riff didn't really happen there.  It was not bad, though.  We had good chemistry the first two hours.  It was terrific.  You're still rocking.  You're still going very strong.  Yeah, we tried some there.  It didn't really work.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I liked it.  Let's play more Pearl Jam.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah, go.  So ready.  What happened?  What did you do wrong now, Sam? 
[02:56:30]  Oh, Sam.  It's weird.  I didn't do anything wrong.  You did something.  Oh, Sam screwed the whole feed up now.  Oh, boy.  What's going on?  You guys are going to have to riff.  What?  Oh, no.  That's right.  All right.  Let it rip.  There it goes.  This will work this time.  Oh, Sam.  What was Sam-ing me?  What happened?  You broke it.  You obviously did something wrong.  You guys can plainly see what's going on, because all the stupid listeners then call  and go, you know what you could do is-  You're fucking- you know what it is?  You're trying to pass blame.  There's no blame.  Those people. 
[02:57:00]  What is that?  I'm just trying to get another mention on that website.  That's all.  They apparently don't think I hate enough.  I don't know.  I hate that.  I think you hate plenty.  Thank you, Sam.  All right.  We better go home if we can't play this clip.  Yeah.  I can reload it.  What?  We'll stay if you can get the clip working.  If not, we're going home.  Oh, here it is.  Oh, boy.  Day one.  President Romney stands up to try.  You have to watch the end.  Mitt Romney.  Did he make it work?  What's he saying?  I'm going to.  Make it work.  Mitt Romney says President Obama beats children over the head with lead pipes to new facilities 
[02:57:30]  in low-wage countries like China.  Romney's never stood up to China.  All he's ever done.  I have.  This is funny.  They put this before the clam thing.  Well, because they know.  Obama loves Chinese people that bring rotten clams from Boston.  He has refrigerated burlap bags in the luggage areas of passenger buses.  All right.  More than 5,400 pounds of these clams have been delivered from southern states to the 
[02:58:00]  Chinatown market in the past six months.  That's crazy.  The Newland Sichuan shop owner's name was not released by the feds.  She is scheduled to be a rich clam.  This is a lawn bird for the New York Post.  Arrested were Hang Chang, Fang Chang, Wah, Hang Chang, Ping, Chang Chang, and Dong Chang.  Wow.  Model airplanes.  Bad clam.  Yeah.  Sounded like model airplanes.  Thought of a little Cox engine. 
[02:58:30]  Recites every name in the Chinese phone book.  You don't know what the criteria is?  Of what?  I mean, it tells you, like, points.  They do it on points.  Yeah, but how do you get, like, an A?  How do you get a B?  How do you get a C?  How do you get a D?  Like, do they tell you?  Like, they weren't saying exactly.  I would assume they find any traces of rats.  That's got to knock you down to a B or a C immediately.  It's a well-kept secret or something.  Yeah, like, it's just you get points for violations. 
[02:59:00]  Oh.  So a B has 14, as long as you have less than 14 points of violation, then you can still  get an A.  Wow.  So you could have 13 points of violation, and you still get an A?  But, like, the good, quote-unquote, grade B restaurants could have 25, 26, 27 points  of sanitary violation.  Shit.  It only goes to C, huh?  Yeah.  A, B, C?  Dude.  Oh, B doesn't sound so good if it's only A, B, and C. 
[02:59:30]  Oh.  No.  What's the view like, though?  I don't like that.  No view.  What the fuck?  House shows.  Oh.  People see many houses.  Thank you.  I need a view.  You're smart.  Grade Pending.  Yeah.  Is because a restaurant's B or C grade is not final until the restaurant has had the  opportunity to go before the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings Health Tribunal to contest  a violation cited against it.  Oh, so when pending, that means they got a shitty grade.  Yeah.  It's definitely not an A.  Wow.  Hey, what's that?  How should consumers interpret grades of B or C? 
[03:00:00]  Right.  Come on.  Help me out.  In the first year or so of grading, we expect that most restaurants will earn a B grade.  Restaurants with B or C grade should improve their overall food safety practices.  Oh, man.  But the health department immediately closes restaurants with conditions that may be hazardous  to public health.  Oh.  What?  So it's like, take your chance, but we would have closed it if it was that bad.  Right.  Gotcha.  Which has happened around here.  There have been restaurants that just close up. 
[03:00:30]  All right.  Well, should we go home now?  No, you shouldn't go home.  Why do you always say that when you have like 20 minutes left?  I don't always say that.  Some days we go right to 1030, Sam.  So that's not it.  Yeah, but that's much of it.  We banked some time.  It's much more rare.  We only did two breaks today.  So that would have been commercials.  That's true.  No.  It's much more rare for you to go to 1030 than it is for you to say, hey, can we go home  now?  God.  Then I got to tell you.  But we never do go home when we say, let's go home now.  That's because Sam Roberts is here.  No.  Eric said we're behind on breaks.  Let Eric say whatever he wants. 
[03:01:00]  We better catch up.  Eric is a lazy guy.  Yeah, we should catch up.  No, you're good to go.  People want to hear your voices.  That should be flattering.  Think of it.  You're like Eddie Vedder on stage, and they're singing along with you right now.  We ran out of material then.  You didn't run out of material.  You barely did any material.  We're not playing even flow.  It was all off the cuff.  Sorry.  Don't do this.  I didn't do this.  Don't blame me.  Girl Jam.  I didn't blame you.  Play Bugs.  Stupid songs suck.  All right.  Enough of this guy.  Yeah, turn us off.  What are we, Travis? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, come on.  Get real.  We're trying to put on a show here.  You want an old lady fight?  Yeah.  And there's the, you also didn't do John Edwards' mistress audio.  What about her?  She was on Piers Morgan.  And what happened?  She was talking about fucking, and she was talking about Elizabeth Edwards, and all this shit.  If you're on Piers Morgan, and no one hears it, did it really happen?  Holy fucking CNN ratings down the shitter.  Bad ratings, right?  Wow.  Bad ratings for all three, by the way.  Fox, not so bad.  They all kind of went down.  Fox is still number one.  CNN, really bad.  Bad, MSNB, pretty bad.  Fox, bad. 
[03:02:00]  So did more people hear Piers Morgan on this show than on his own show?  I think so.  I think people are getting sick of just the bullshit.  All the crapola.  Where they just bash to one side, and then you go to the other channel, and they bash  to the other side bad.  It's just ridiculous.  But like Hannity.  There's no real honest discussion anymore.  Hannity does really well.  You sure he's doing well?  Him and Bill O'Reilly are still?  Bill O'Reilly, click.  He does very, very well.  You don't like Bill O'Reilly, right?  Eh, I don't watch the show.  He spins so much, he makes everyone dizzy. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah.  And then he has the balls to call his show, the No Spin Zone.  Welcome to the No Spin Zone.  It's just a whirling dervish.  You're on a carousel when you watch this fucking show.  Who's he kidding?  Yeah, yeah.  He just starts spinning.  Pinheads.  Calling out his gas.  Pinhead or Patriot.  You like that segment?  Pinhead or Patriot.  He's got segments.  He sells fucking...  Are we Patriots or Pinheads?  I think we'd be Pinheads.  Yeah.  We'd be Pinheads. 
[03:03:00]  But we'd be lovable Pinheads.  Well, that's a badge of honor.  Not too much damage done, you know.  I like when he tells people to email him pithy comments.  Because nobody else on TV really says pithy that much.  No, they don't.  That's how I learned the word pithy when I was in college, watching The O'Reilly Factor.  Yeah.  What's pithy?  How great is this?  I got a million eyes trying to find me a beach house today.  You see what I mean?  And you want to go home early.  How great is this?  You're putting your listeners to work.  These people are nice.  You put the word out.  And you want to go home early. 
[03:03:30]  I'm not going to the Outer Banks this year.  Why not?  Fuck!  Just go to the Outer Banks.  Because I had bad luck the last two years.  I'm taking a break.  Wait, what are you putting...  Making a deposit on the outside or something?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Home run kubia.  When he said home run kubia.  Home run kubia.  He's so excited.  Oh.  Goddamn chip.  What's that?  You want an old lady...  Wowee.  You want an old lady bus fight? 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Old lady bus fight?  Or bus fight with old ladies.  Okay.  Now, where was this, by the way?  Which part of Oakland?  It's always, by the way, the most bus fights ever.  Oakland, California.  Cleared.  You can must squeeze you, Cleared.  Yeah.  And I don't take no orders from no woman, by the way.  By the way, I don't take no orders from no women.  Wow.  Just in case you didn't understand him the first time, he had to reiterate. 
[03:04:30]  Damn.  He let us know.  I love that.  What's it?  What, the woman going to tell him not to?  What the hell?  You've been out there.  God bless everybody.  Can you, can you tell this woman to get out of my face, please, sir?  I think by the goddamn bomb.  Why don't you fuck off?  I'm not the loser.  You are our queen.  You're a loser.  You're a loser.  Like everybody else does.  Fuck you.  People love this, by the way.  If I was on this bus, I'd be loving this.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, me too.  Society made you the way you are.  Oh, fuck you, you. 
[03:05:00]  Fuck me.  Weirdo.  I'm not the weirdo.  Weirdo.  Nailed it.  Everybody else pays to get out of my face.  You stupid head.  You fucking retard brain, you black munch.  No, because you're lying.  Because you're lying.  Why don't you fuck yourself?  Because you're lying.  A lot of people don't need to hear this kind of language.  Fuck you.  Here's what we're going to do.  It's a driver.  I have the option to decide how to deal with this.  It's a game show?  Yeah, really.  I want both in it.  Kind of cool it. 
[03:05:30]  Go to your corners.  Okay.  I have no problem with having the police come on and straighten it out.  String it in.  Either one of you want that.  I think you're both right the way you feel, but we're not going to take it out on a city  bus.  Yeah.  Deal?  End of story.  So to speak.  Deal?  Deal.  Deal.  Deal.  Deal.  And then they started with this argument type deal.  That's my deal with you.  So I said, hey, what are you arguing about?  And they said, hey, it's none of your business.  And I said, I don't run that kind of joint here. 
[03:06:00]  Yep.  Yep.  I'm not too sure I agree with your police work there, Lou.  Well, Sam, that took up a minute.  Well, I think those ladies who got yelled at at the bus.  I don't even know the back story.  Well, I didn't give you that.  Well, how about you give us the video so we can see what these bros look like?  What am I going to write?  Bus fight?  Oh, yeah.  I guess it's just old ladies fighting and they wanted to say the C word badly, but they  fought so hard, Margie.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  And now they're each going to get $600,000.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they got yelled at on a bus.  Yep.  Isn't that the, that's what it takes, right?  To make half a million, over half a million dollars to get yelled at on a bus?  There are a couple white broads from Boston.  Oh, they were?  Boston shit.  That was Boston shit.  The driver definitely did not sound Bostonian.  He sounded Canadian.  A bit more north.  Like from Fargo.  He was north.  Yeah.  Sounded like Fargo.  Yeah, babe, the blue ox.  Free house for Opie. 
[03:07:00]  Damn, that sounds good.  We're pretty busy, but that's the way we like it.  Can I check out this free house?  Do you mind?  Oh, a free house.  Free house.  That sounds great.  I'm sure it's wonderful.  Probably no catches.  Jay, what's the free house all about?  Are you willing to go three hours north to southern New Hampshire?  On a lake, nine mile lake.  What does that have to do with the Jersey Shore?  What the fuck?  A lake in New Hampshire.  In Manch, Vegas?  I'm sure it's lovely.  For 4th of July.  I want to run it for the whole summer, meaning I still got to work and maybe go back and 
[03:07:30]  forth and shit.  That's fucking great.  Dude, it's three hours.  You can be there in three hours.  You can have it for nothing.  On a lake.  And then what happens when I have to be back at work the next day?  He's installing cameras already.  Exactly.  You never take a free house from a stranger.  Never pull out the front, quad out the back.  Yeah.  Look at Opie's cock.  I got it on camera.  I could pass this on to your exes and family.  Yeah.  They would enjoy a free house. 
[03:08:00]  That would look great.  Bringing the show right back around.  Why don't you vacation in the Andes?  Andes.  In Andes.  The Andes.  Yes.  The Andes.  Andes.  Same thing.  Well, we call it the Andes.  Yes.  Where are you taking me?  We'll go antiquing.  Hey, it's Gunny.  Oh, boy.  Is her marriage busted up yet?  No, but she was getting into fights with her husband already.  Already?  Yeah.  Her love of strange cock.  I don't know, but she said, like, they already had one time when they were fighting, and  she left the bedroom and went and slept on a couch.  They've been married two weeks. 
[03:08:30]  She just got married.  It's not right.  Holy shit.  I got to hear that.  Why is she going to change your name to Sagums?  Oh, man.  You are evil.  Do you want to?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Two seconds.  It's Nicole from the morning mashup.  She's been married two weeks.  Two weeks.  I hear you're already fighting with your husband.  Yes, you are.  Wait, wait.  And somebody slept on the couch or something.  And said, you had a fight that was good enough where you slept on the couch already?  That's fighting with your fucking husband.  I didn't. 
[03:09:00]  But, you know, isn't that normal at the beginning?  No.  You've been married two weeks.  It's all about just fucking, fucking, fucking.  He was pissing me off.  What did he do to piss you off?  He was just, he, like, just, I think he's just stressed at work, and he was snapping  at me, and everything I did was wrong.  Yeah, that'll get better and go away as time goes on in the marriage.  But it's good.  Things are good now.  We're better.  How long were you on the couch?  Or was he on the couch?  No, no, he came over because I was crying on the couch.  He said, please don't sleep on the couch.  Guys love that, by the way.  Nice crying on the couch, interrupting his sleep. 
[03:09:30]  That's an evil weapon you ladies have.  You're crying.  The tears.  Fuck.  I can't be mad anymore.  Damn it.  I never would tell him to go sleep on the couch because he never would go, so I have to go.  I mean, if I was like, get out of here, go sleep on the couch.  Do you understand?  What time was this, by the way?  Maybe like 11.  11 at night.  Did he have to go to work in the morning?  Yeah.  Okay.  Did you start the fight right before he went to bed?  Yeah.  See, that's what ladies do.  This is what ladies do.  Women do.  And my ex twat used to do this.  I think pretty much every woman knows this.  She'd start a fight. 
[03:10:00]  They'd start the fights just as your head is hitting the pillow.  Yeah.  And then if they go to the couch.  That's evil.  You know that, right?  It is.  I'm sorry.  If they go to the couch, you can't just lay there and be like, oh good, I'll just go to  sleep because you're fuming.  You're fuming.  And then you're looking at the clock and more hours are going by and you're like, I got to  go to work.  And this fucking self-centered bitch is fucking everything.  That's me.  Well, in that relationship, I guess it would be you.  Role playing wise.  So what was it about?  It had, there had to be one single instance that got you pissed.  He said something.  He did something. 
[03:10:30]  What was it?  He does a lot of just snapping.  Like I can't do, I couldn't do anything right.  Like he was mad that, that I like brushed my teeth near him or something.  He just was like, nothing I did was right.  And I was sick of it.  Were you doing a lot of wrong stuff?  I wasn't.  Is that wrong to brush my teeth near you?  If he's trying to brush his teeth.  Wow.  You guys are never going to make it.  No, we're going to make it.  It's going to be fun.  How many years do you think, Sam?  Two?  I think they'll make two.  Thanks.  Yeah.  You're starting to criticize little things I do.  Wow.  Wow.  Here we go.  You're trying hard not to show it, baby. 
[03:11:00]  But baby, baby, I know it.  You've lost that loving feeling.  Whoa, that loving feeling.  He's got the voice.  Yeah, he does.  You lost that loving feeling.  Now it's gone.  Gone, gone.  That's the good part.  Oh.  Wow.  Boom, boom.  You've got a great voice.  Oh, thank you.  For heartbreaking songs.  Okay.  They have to be heartbreaking songs. 
[03:11:30]  You know how many times Jess and me have fought in the three and a half weeks?  Zero.  You're in bliss.  Three and a half weeks.  Three and a half weeks.  It's not that it's bliss.  It's too early for the fighting.  Yeah.  But I think he just says that, Sam.  I don't, I think he's.  No, it's too early for the fighting.  How long have you been married?  June 9th we got married.  So that's not even, that's two weeks.  Yeah, that's a week less than me and Jess.  We got a lot of passion.  Passion.  We fight hard and we love hard.  I finally saw you.  Take that passion right into the courtroom.  I finally saw you two together, man.  It's intense.  It is intense.  Yeah, you two are intense. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  What's his background nationality wise?  He's Irish.  Oh boy.  Yeah, he's got the Irish.  Wow.  Does he drink?  A lot.  Oh shit.  He drinks a lot and there might be other substances involved.  I'll be honest.  That's nobody's business, I don't think.  I said mine.  I don't know.  I don't know your fucking personal life.  Let me put it this way.  There's a party going on though.  Troy hung out with Nicole and her husband at my wedding.  All right, I'm leaving now.  We know Troy likes to get down.  All right.  Troy is down for anything.  Troy's down for whatever.  All right.  There she goes.  Oh, whatever.  They're not going to make it. 
[03:12:30]  Oh man, I so see divorce in that future.  Of course.  And not even the far future.  No, not far at all.  If he's already snapping.  Yeah.  Oh, you know what?  She must be a disaster to be married to.  Bitch on wheels, right?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what?  And he's a drunk Irishman.  Definitely.  Yes, he is.  Wow.  I don't know what she does, by the way, because now she's going to be mad.  What?  She's on the morning matchup.  It just seems like there might be a party going on.  She's on the morning matchup.  Good old, one of my pals, Big Lou Bruno, we were talking about the clams.  Hey, Big Lou.  And I remember when he tweeted this picture, and it means something today. 
[03:13:00]  He lives near a beach, and here's a Chinese lady digging up the mussels.  What are these?  They look like...  Is she pulling mussels from a shell?  And what are they?  They're black because she's getting them out.  They're doing it down on canvas sand.  They're doing it.  They're black because she's pulling them out of black sand.  Is that...  Yeah, that's bad.  Oh, you know what they are?  They're the piss clams, I believe.  Piss clams! 
[03:13:30]  Because they've got their little penises that stick out of the shell.  Oh, a good piss clam.  I think.  That's what she's pulling out of the ground?  And they're actually the size of penises she's used to.  That's right.  Get it?  I get it, because the Asians have tiny pricks.  Right.  Exactly.  So some would say.  And she's collecting it, and it looks like she's getting a lot of them because she might  be running a restaurant somewhere.  You're not supposed to do that.  That can't be healthy.  I don't think those are passing any kind of inspection.  No, I don't think that's healthy.  Thank you, Big Lou Bruno, for that picture. 
[03:14:00]  I'm trying to think.  They look like...  Brutal.  No, you know what?  They do look...  I don't know, man.  Fuck.  Aren't you supposed to do that yet?  Clams or piss clams.  I think you walk around...  They're not mussels.  And you poke your foot in the sand, and then when you see the...  Stream of water pop up, like piss, you find the piss clam.  Those are only good if you dip them in the hot butter, the piss clams.  Not my favorite.  I'm not going to eat a piss clam.  You've never had a piss clam?  No.  Not my favorite, but...  I like shit oysters.  Shit oysters are good.  I've become a big fan of the mussels. 
[03:14:30]  A puke lobster.  What?  Growing up, no one ate mussels.  No one ate mussels, where I was from.  Mussels.  I was from Centerport, near all the local beaches.  We saw mussels, but no one grabbed them and ate them.  Mussels smell so fishy.  They smell like low tide.  Dude, if you cook them right, a little fucking...  Yeah.  Red pepper, hot red pepper.  Oh, like money used to make, right?  Some fresh tomatoes in there.  Yeah.  Keep the sauce light, but tomatoey.  Nice.  Yeah.  Dip the bread.  Oh, you dip the bread.  You dip the bread.  Uh, marron. 
[03:15:00]  All right, Sam, now we really made it to the end.  Wow, we fucking did really well today, didn't we?  Yeah, I mean, we can give them an extra two and a half.  Much to your chagrin, we did well.  Yeah.  Much to my chagrin, I'm the one who pushes you guys.  So then they say, Sam, the time is yours.  I'm the one who's pushing you guys, okay?  Time is right, and let's move you up.  I'm your number one fan.  I'm your head cheerleader.  I'm the coach here.  Oh, like Sandusky.  That's right.  Are you a rat?  Now bring Travis in here.  Oh, Dr. Gay!  Are you a rat?  I'm not a rat. 
[03:15:30]  I'm on your side.  By the way, I will not be listening to the after show, so you don't have to try as hard.  I know you try very hard, because in the back of your head, you're like, picture me driving,  picture me listening, and you're like, ooh, I gotta do a good show for Anthony.  And then I get those texts from you, and it's interactive with what we're doing, and I'm like, yes!  I like that.  I text a little thing, and then I have to wait for the delay and wait for you to get the opportunity.  And then I'm like, ooh, he's reading my text.  I get all nervous in the truck.  I'm like, oh, he's reading my text.  And I tell my friends, hey, do you hear? 
[03:16:00]  I made it on the after show today with my text.  Guess who just texted me.  Guess who just texted me.  Oh, it's great.  I got a text.  Did I know?  I got a read for everybody.  Ooh.  Sagums is the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Sagums?  She didn't say that.  I didn't say that.  I'm so glad she didn't hear that.  I didn't say that.  I wasn't.  That drunk Irish husband's gonna kick your ass.  Yeah, he's intense.  Yeah.  He's a good guy.  He's fun.  He throws, though.  I can tell.  Oh, yeah, he'll fight.  He throws.  He throws the intense like a circus tent.  Was she cold or was she holding him up?  Three ring circus.  Hmm? 
[03:16:30]  Was she cold or was she holding him up?  She had her arms like this.  Yeah.  I think she was cold.  She was doing an arm bra.  I wasn't an arm bra or was she cold?  Holding him up with a folded arm.  Arm bra.  Probably a little of both.  Yeah.  Lifts and separates.  You think Sagums is where it goes to next?  Yeah.  I think they're doomed.  They are.  How do you just get married?  You're a fucking goddamn on the couch?  On the couch?  You don't walk away from your husband and sleep on the couch when you just got married.  Two and a half weeks in? 
[03:17:00]  That's bad.  Two and a half weeks.  That's a bad sign.  Two and a half weeks.  You should be spraying jizz like a fire hose around your house.  Uncontrollably jizzing.  That's right.  Please.  There's jizz all over my apartment right now.  Exactly.  You got jizz all over your place?  Oh, please.  It looks like a fiery aircraft was coming in and they foamed the runway, right?  It's ridiculous.  The cat is drenched.  The cat's all matted?  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  No, he's fucking...  It's just cum everywhere.  And there's jizz in his water.  He's just drinking it. 
[03:17:30]  He doesn't care.  It's just jizz.  It's all over.  Breaking news.  Oh.  Justin Bieber is following me on Twitter.  That's not true.  I'll pass the phone.  What does it say right there?  My latest follows.  There's no verification check.  It says Justin Bieber.  It's not the real Justin Bieber.  Justin Bieber is following me.  Oh, boy.  Well, the real Carly Rae Jepsen is following me.  Do you see that?  Justin Bieber is following me.  Oh, wow.  That's him.  There's no verification check.  It's not him.  Does it say Justin Bieber? 
[03:18:00]  It's going to say Justin Bieber.  There you go.  The actual Carly Rae Jepsen is following me on Twitter.  She's not really taking off like you thought.  She's got the song in the summer.  You backed the wrong fucking horse.  Are you insane?  What?  Call Me Maybe is the biggest song right now.  I don't think it is.  And she's following you?  Oh, yeah.  You're out of here, mister.  I don't think it is.  Call Me Maybe is the biggest song right now.  Listen to that.  It's the biggest song in the country right now.  It's number one.  Call Me Maybe. 
[03:18:30]  Call Me Maybe.  You go to billboard.com and her face is...  Why don't you call me maybe?  She's number one on Hot 100.  Call Me Maybe.  Why don't you call me maybe?  Well...  Now, let me ask you.  Is she your biggest celebrity following you?  Yeah, right now.  I mean, she won't be in six months when nobody's listening to the song anymore, but she is right 
[03:19:00]  now.  I wonder who my biggest celebrity following me is.  One of the Fox News correspondents.  Follows you?  Is that it?  No, he doesn't follow me, but he shouted out last night.  He said LonelyVirgil.Tumblr.com was the funniest blog he's ever seen.  And he didn't even know.  And where was he?  He didn't know that was you.  He wrote it on his Twitter.  That's great.  Oh, on his Twitter, but did he do it on his show?  I don't think so.  He's just one of those talking head guys.  I forget his name.  He's one of the black guys.  I don't even know.  You know what? 
[03:19:30]  He's the biggest celeb.  I have to look.  Let me do this for this guy.  Remember I said, look, I hate underscore people on Twitter.  I really do.  This guy took my advice and he changed his Twitter.  Due to Opie Radio, I've changed my stupid Twitter name.  So I'm going to give this guy a big plug for fucking doing the right thing.  Wow.  Everyone should follow RockApeXL.  See how easy that is?  Instead of Rock underscore this blank blop.  Yeah.  RockApeXL.  There you go.  See how smart that was? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  See this guy.  What?  Oh, Jesus.  That guy follows you?  No, he doesn't follow me, but he's a big lonely.  He's a fucking asshole.  No, he's not.  He's a Lonely Virgil fan.  That guy is an asshole.  How do you know?  I've seen his, he spews some dumb shit.  Does he?  Yes.  Mark Lamont Hill.  I don't like him, man.  Look what he said.  This is the funniest blog that I've seen in forever.  Lonely blog.  Sent everybody to Lonely Virgil.  Wow.  I don't know where he found it.  That's pretty good.  I think he had a lot to say about Imus, if I remember correctly. 
[03:20:30]  Ah.  He's one of those guys.  Ah, yeah.  I don't like him, man.  I do now.  I do not like him.  My loyalties are to Lonely Virgil before Mr. Imus.  Yeah.  Can we go home now, Sam?  I think we're good.  You actually went a little overtime today.  You did good today, right?  And you know what I didn't tell you?  What?  Uh-oh.  You said, if we were going to leave so that the after show starts at 10, what time would  it be?  Right.  And then you said it'd be 9.52, right?  And I said, right.  Mm-hmm.  That is a lie. 
[03:21:00]  Well, 9.48 was the time, because you have triple breaks.  Oh, shit.  Because you didn't take all your breaks.  He's fucking us.  So we did...  And he does it, so he has to do less show.  Is it official we did 15 minutes extra today?  48 to...  Yeah.  Now it's official.  See how that works?  You did 15 minutes of extra show?  I'm writing that down for next week, because we're going to need some extra time.  I ain't fucking doing much radio next week.  The end of this show reminds me of a plane crash that just skids flaming to a grinding 
[03:21:30]  halt.  It was good.  That's pretty funny.  Let me tell you, the beginning of this show was gangbusters.  It was good, right?  It was really good.  I thought so, too.  I thought the whole thing was very good.  I thought it was terrific.  Even the end.  Come on.  That was great.  What were we just fucking talking about?  Carly Rae Jepsen, Lonely Virgil.  See?  Yeah, it was good.  What is this?  The after show?  That guy was an asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  I think that guy's an asshole for real.  That was a lot of good shit.  I've heard some dumb shit out of his mouth on wherever he goes.  Uh-uh.  All those news channels are the same to me. 
[03:22:00]  I don't care about political...  Virgil.  It's just...  There's so many pictures of him alone.  Are more coming in?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Fantastic.  Lonely Virgil on Twitter is where you can send all the pictures to you.  They're perfect.  What?  You got another Twitter account just for this, too?  Whoever's in charge of this mystery Lonely Virgil.  Right.  Whoever it is.  You're so proud of yourself, aren't you?  So proud.  I am.  Why wouldn't you?  And calling it Lonely Virgil.  Perfect.  Short, sweet, concise. 
[03:22:30]  I want to have a fun Tumblr.  You got to come up with something as good as Lonely Virgil.  All right.  I'm going to try now.  The bar has been set.  Look at him.  Look at all that floor space in front of him.  That's terrific.  Roland, what do you got?  Because I'm not talking after these mics go off.  What do you got for us?  He learned from last time when he pitched guests.  And we were still on the air.  I told him.  Oh, everyone heard the whole J.J.  Walker thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't know the mics were still on.  Jimmy J.J. Walker?  Sometimes I know when the mics were still on.  That one I didn't know and I don't care. 
[03:23:00]  The Jimmy J.J. Walker.  Roland, what do you got?  I'm good.  What's the matter?  I have a text review of the show coming in from Justin Stengel from David Letterman.  Yeah, yeah.  But he tweets everybody.  He said, no, text message, not tweet message.  Ooh, exchanging phone numbers.  He found time to listen to us instead of Howard Stern.  Oh, that's nice of you, Justin.  He listens to both shows.  One in one ear, one in the other?  I'm just fucking over.  He said, tell them the show was good and not so much.  And not so much. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah, that's what he said.  What do you mean, not so much?  He doesn't know.  He's just kidding.  He hasn't been to the Lonely Virgil site yet.  Oh.  It's a great site.  Once he gets there, he'll be like, oh, shit.  Oh, I see.  All right, well.  Well, I'm surely not going to be sitting here when Sam starts his drivel.  That's for sure.  Hang out.  Nah, I don't think so.  No.  Um, I don't think so.  Oh.  What is this?  Do you guys want some free food for tomorrow?  Yep.  Yeah.  From where?  These sauce guys make, like, the best sauce in the world.  Oh, he's been selling these sauce guys forever. 
[03:24:00]  Who are the sauce guys?  Roland's trying to get hooked up.  Who are the sauce guys?  They make sauce.  They could put over pasta in their bread bowls.  It's fucking amazing.  I've been here.  I'll fucking do pasta tomorrow.  Let's call tomorrow pasta Friday.  I am so in.  Can we make it sort of like breakfast?  How do you make pasta sort of like breakfast?  You just eat it in the morning.  I need a red sauce, though.  I gotta go red sauce.  He's been talking about this meat sauce for weeks.  Months.  Months.  What kind of meat sauce?  It's fucking amazing.  What do they call it?  In Williamsburg.  Is it meat sauce?  It's a meat sauce, but it has like... 
[03:24:30]  A meat sauce.  A meat sauce.  It's a meat sauce.  You said the name of a show yesterday.  You guys were talking about like TV shows or something yesterday.  Yeah.  And he said the name of a show.  It didn't even sound like the show.  I don't know what it was.  Well, sometimes, I mean, sometimes we just ignore it because he comes up with stuff that  even when you can understand him, it's unrelatable and nobody knows what he's talking about.  Yeah, there is a meat sauce.  Iraq, do you like meat sauce?  I like meat sauce.  I like a good bolognese.  You really had to ask me that?  You like meat sauce? 
[03:25:00]  What the hell is that?  Damn it!  He loves for us!  Fuck!  He loves a good meat sauce.  Give me something with a nice scampi, then.  I got confirmation that, yes, indeed, that Asian woman was pulling pissed clams out of  the mud.  So those are the cheapest clams you can find.  How about pissed clams, where you get them and they try to sock you on the face?  Probably Fremont Street in Vegas, you get those.  I have no idea what you said.  Call me.  Let's see if he's singing Vegas.  You're singing Call Me Maybe already, aren't you? 
[03:25:30]  Call Me Maybe.  Hey, I just made you.  Yeah?  Yeah.  This is crazy.  Okay.  But here's my number.  Uh-huh.  So call me maybe.  Yeah!  It's hard to look right at your baby.  But here's my number.  So call me maybe.  Hey, I just made you.  And this is crazy.  But here's my number.  So call me maybe.  And all the other boys try to chase me. 
[03:26:00]  But here's my number.  So call me maybe.  You took your time with the call.  I took no time with the fall.  You gave me nothing at all.  But still you're in my way.  I beg and borrow and steal.  At first sight and it's real.  I didn't know I would feel it.  But it's in my way.  Your stare was holding.  Ripped jeans, skin was showing.  Hot night wind was blowing. 
[03:26:30]  Where you think you're going, baby.  Hey, I just met you.  And this is crazy.  But here's my number.  So call me maybe.  It's hard to look right at you, baby.  But here's my number.  So call me maybe.  Hey, I just met you.  Shut up, shut up.  And this is crazy.  But here's my number.  So call me maybe.  I'll go home and get you a fucking shine box.  So call me maybe.  Try to chase me. 
[03:27:00]  But here's my number.  So call me maybe.  Boy, you came into my brain.  So bad.  You use your time earlier in a $20 hole.  And I don't take no orders from no woman, by the way.  By the way, I don't take no orders from no women.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke? 
[03:27:30]  And I don't listen to women yelling.  I tell them to shut up.  Well, no shit.  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.  So call me maybe.  And all the other boys try to chase me.  But here's my number.  So call me maybe.  Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad.  I missed you so bad.  I missed you so, so bad. 
[03:28:00]  Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad.  You should know that.  So call me maybe.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around, After ONA Live is next. </pre>
