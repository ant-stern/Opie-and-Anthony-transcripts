<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton, engaging in their characteristic profane and insulting banter directed at each other and their staff, Ben and Steve.  They discussed their hectic work schedule, having recorded five shows that week, including a Halloween show they decided against re-airing.  Norton announced his upcoming two-week absence for filming his HBO series and a trip to Las Vegas, recounting a bizarre incident involving a helicopter hovering over his house for an extended period, sparking speculation about possible illegal activities.  This led to a humorous and vulgar discussion about Norton's dreams and masturbation, especially focusing on the challenges and opportunities of adolescent self-pleasure.  The conversation then shifted to a New York Post article about "Puggles," a pug-beagle mix, sparking a discussion about puppy mills, animal abuse, and the inevitable disappointment of cute puppies growing up, all punctuated with graphic and offensive jokes. A caller later provided an explanation for the helicopter incident near Norton's house.  They also touched upon "No Filter Paul's" latest "assault on the media" video, showing his disruption of a news broadcast, and reminisced about their first, now-unlistenable show. The segment concluded with a discussion of a JetBlue emergency landing and the pilot's calm demeanor, interspersed with racial slurs.

The show continued with mockery of a child breakdancing with pizza dough on *Good Morning America*, seguing into darkly humorous suggestions on how to dispose of the puggle featured on the same show.  This transitioned into an offensive discussion about the treatment of fat people, including graphic and demeaning descriptions.  The main focus then became their own "Assault on the Media" prank, detailing how they, along with Bam, Aaron, and Mike, disrupted a Channel 7 news report by yelling their show's name and jumping behind reporter Stacey Sager, forcing her to abandon her live shot.  They discussed the prank's success, similar pranks in Boston, and the addictive nature of these stunts.  Paul provided details of the planning and execution, highlighting the reporter's reaction and the Fox 5 crew's indifference.  They also discussed their promotional efforts, including billboards and advertisements in *Us Weekly* and the *Daily News*, explaining their aggressive self-promotion strategy due to perceived shortcomings in XM's marketing.

A significant portion of the show covered Tyra Banks' segment on her talk show where she wore a fat suit. Opie and Anthony provided highly derogatory and offensive commentary, interspersed with a cryptic message about changing radio industry alliances and an upcoming meeting with a powerful individual.  They played audio from Tyra Banks’ segment, followed by further offensive commentary and speculation about her personal life.  This was followed by more discussion of the "Assault on the Media" pranks and their contest, along with additional audio from the Tyra Banks segment.  A listener called in, agreeing with the show's justification for the pranks.

The show then opened with sexually suggestive comments from Opie, including a claim of sex addiction and a plane incident.  He made derogatory comments about a female celebrity's behavior on "Punk'd."  A call from Mike from Allentown, Pennsylvania, led to a discussion of Billy Joel's "Allentown" and the city's changes.  They criticized the "Jersey Guys" radio show, calling them "frauds" and complaining about their use of an echo effect, with a caller, Drew Boogie, offering a possible explanation.  A phone interview with Marcus, a fired "Apprentice" contestant, followed.  Marcus discussed his negative portrayal on the show, promoted his product (footmate.com), detailed a "sex in the workplace" task, criticized the editing and other contestants (particularly Clay), and audio of his firing by Donald Trump was played.  The hosts and Marcus discussed the show's editing and Trump's limited screen time.  Opie then recounted a negative experience with a Los Angeles landlord, involving roaches and a security deposit dispute. Rich Voss and Bonnie, who were in studio, along with Bill, joined the conversation, discussing their stand-up performances and audiences.  The segment continued with crude jokes, sexually explicit conversations, a story from Rich Voss about finding his tooth in his feces, and a discussion about internet predators and Perverted Justice.  Bill also smelled Rich Voss' ear, which was described as having a strong unpleasant odor.

A substantial portion of the show focused on a Perverted Justice sting operation targeting online child predators and the upcoming departure of Bruce Kelly from XM.  They detailed Perverted Justice's methods, highlighting the reactions and professions of those caught, including a special education teacher and a rabbi, with graphic descriptions and crude jokes.  The emotional farewell to Bruce Kelly involved playing humorous and vulgar audio clips from previous broadcasts, leading to sentimental reflections on their shared experiences and inside jokes. Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane were in-studio guests.  Andrew Long called in to present Jim Norton with a trophy for his HBO performance.  Other segments included the "sex offender game" (planned for a future broadcast), speculation about an upcoming meeting with an "arch enemy," reaction to a video called "Help a Rascal," discussion of their billboard and appearances in publications, discussion of hybrid cars and their perceived correlation with the gay community, and constant interwoven banter, jokes, and side conversations.

The final segment began with a discussion of "Willy Wonka" and "The Wizard of Oz" Munchkins, including their number and wages. This transitioned into a discussion about iPod video content, focusing on downloadable pornography and a humorous tangent about "septic tank" misinterpretations.  Bonnie McFarlane and Rich Voss, promoting their appearances at Bananas, were in-studio guests.  A significant portion focused on the "Assault on the Media Contest," particularly No Filter Paul's stunt.  Prizes were detailed (Jägermeister-sponsored guitars, amps, and a Disturbed meet-and-greet).  They discussed monetizing video content via iPod and mobile downloads, their personal music tastes, MySpace, and their comedic performances.  The segment concluded with a "what did we learn" segment, listener contributions, final plugs, and goodbyes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Dopey, two guys that hate each other.  Just shut your mouth.  I hate them.  Shut up.  Don't be untimed.  Shut up, bitch.  Oh, very nice.  Shut the fuck up.  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton, and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it. 
[00:00:30]  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshat.  These dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places.  Ben, where's the quality?  He rocked.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, fling it now.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Good Lord.  What are you people? 
[00:01:30]  On dope?  This is great ice, Steve.  Oh, those guys are bad.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, Walk, Greaseball, Goombas come out of the woodwork.  It was the greatest piece of the last I've ever had. 
[00:02:00]  And I've had them all over the world.  All over the world.  All over the world.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  What's up, Anthony?  What's up, little Jimmy Norton?  Nice Friday.  Good.  That's a good thing.  God, this week flew by, didn't it?  Did it?  We got a lot accomplished this week on the fine radio program.  I don't know.  The subordinates were all bitching on the elevator yesterday. 
[00:02:30]  Why?  The week was taking so long.  I was right there with him, too.  I was like, yeah, you think we took it like a day off.  Would have broken the week up?  But it didn't seem to.  We didn't really take a day off.  We didn't?  No, we did two shows on Monday.  Oh.  We've done four radio shows.  Oh, no, we actually did five radio shows this week.  That's right.  That thing was broadcasted.  I keep forgetting.  Yeah.  Yeah, that went on the air.  And people are searching for it on audible.com and everything. 
[00:03:00]  No finding it?  I don't know.  I guess they should throw it up on audible.com.  If people want to pay for that nonsense, then go ahead.  We're not replaying it.  Take it away.  We were going to replay our Halloween show this weekend, but decided to pass on that.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  Anyway, so we'll do a little radio, and then we'll have the weekend off.  Right.  And then we say goodbye to Jimmy Norton for a couple weeks.  Oh, he's leaving again?  We were getting a little too comfortable having Jimmy Norton around. 
[00:03:30]  Then I'm back for two weeks, though.  We're out to Vegas.  Wait, you're out two, then you're back two?  Back two, yeah.  That'll be fun.  That's not bad.  It's the holiday.  He goes back to L.A. to continue filming his HBO series.  I'm going to learn a casino business.  I'm now calling it your HBO series.  But it's not mine, Opie.  Oh.  Yeah, it is.  They don't call it.  Oh, we're concerned.  It is.  It's yours.  That's for sure.  You're going to be the breakout character.  You watch.  You watch.  So.  There's a goddamn helicopter over my house last night. 
[00:04:00]  You're now seeing helicopters.  I'm not kidding.  You're now seeing helicopters.  I was even making the joke.  You're now seeing helicopters.  You want helicopters?  You want helicopters?  I swear.  There was no helicopter over your house.  There was a helicopter hovering like right over my house for about half hour last night.  All the stuff you bring up on this show, you have to bring in proof.  I'm sorry.  I want it.  And you know something?  I was going to take.  Because no one's believing you anymore.  I was going to take video. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  But I was afraid that if I went outside, that there'd either be a bad guy out there, or the  cops would tell you to get the hell inside.  I didn't see any cops, though, outside or in the street or anything.  Did they have, like...  I turned my lights on out in the backyard and everything.  Were they lighting up the ground from above?  A couple of times, the little spotlight came on.  All right.  They were looking for somebody.  It was sweeping around.  But I couldn't find anything in the news today.  They were looking for somebody.  What was that?  Maybe the home invading guy.  Maybe home invading guy? 
[00:05:00]  Home invading guy, yeah.  I don't like the idea that they're searching around like exactly...  Dude, it was where I couldn't look out any of my windows on any side of the house  and see the helicopter.  I had to get, like, out of my house, look up to see where it was.  It was directly over my house.  I hate that.  Maybe they're looking into some of your...  I'm doing nothing against the law.  I'm a law-abiding citizen.  Maybe they're fans of the radio show and they're getting a little nervous that you're buying 
[00:05:30]  so much firearms.  Something about artillery?  And they want to make sure it's all on the up and up.  I am a safe citizen.  Are you smuggling firearms to the country?  I'm not smuggling.  Everything I've purchased has done a legit, reputable gun dealership.  I don't go buying from the streets of uptown New York or anything shifty or shady.  Do you have an underground railroad?  There's no underground railroad.  Running from your basement? 
[00:06:00]  I am not transporting people or weaponry.  Well, you did have your uncle on the air a couple days ago about the pot thing.  Well, that was 1979.  Yeah, but maybe the helicopters are making sure you don't have, you know, 12-foot pot bushes  in your backyard.  The pot leaf doesn't fall far from the plant?  No.  I do nothing illegal.  I'm petrified of prison.  What are you kidding?  I have dreams that are awful sometimes, that I have committed a heinous crime. 
[00:06:30]  It usually involves murder of some sort.  And it was like years ago, and all of a sudden the cops are on to me.  Out of nowhere, the cops are on to me.  And now I'm like, oh my God, I did, I was involved in that murder.  And now they found some evidence, and you watch these shows like CSI, you know you're screwed.  And I wake up, and when you wake up, it's like, oh, that is the best thing when you  wake up out of one of those dreams.  That is the best feeling ever.  Because then it's like, you know what, though? 
[00:07:00]  It also could be the worst feeling ever.  Why is that?  Let's be honest.  Got to come here.  What about the wet dreams that happen every once in a while?  I have not had a wet dream in years.  Years.  Well, you know what?  You should have went through a few years there where you were, you know, completely without  anybody and single.  Then you get the buildup, and what happens is you have to release during the night.  That's what a wet dream is, sir.  Yeah, but when you're single, that's what jacking's for.  Yeah, I understand.  That's what porno and jacking is for. 
[00:07:30]  I understand you're jacking here and there, but...  Here and there.  But you're not getting...  Here, there, and everywhere.  But you're not getting enough action to completely keep the level down.  Really?  So every once in a while, the level will build up, and you get these fine wet dreams.  I can't agree with your theory.  And that's when this waking up thing could be a real drag, because you think you're  really into some hot piece of ass, and that damn alarm goes off and wrecks everything.  I can't agree with your theory, though, because when I was a kid, and I was just tugging it,  tugging it, it was... 
[00:08:00]  I would still have wet dreams.  Because you know how much you were producing as a kid?  Dude, I was getting rid of it the second it was coming up.  The older you get, you know, production goes down a little bit.  There was a home-from-school day sometimes where I was sick with a fever, and you'd be alone.  The fever boner.  Home alone.  Because when you really think about it, it's very hard for a kid of just newly jacking age  to get some alone time, you know? 
[00:08:30]  Get that alone time that you really need to tug out a good one.  I'll say.  And when you're home sick from school, and mom's got to leave and leaves you alone in  the house, you've got to carte blanche to just, you know, jack and jack and jack.  You're so right, because my early jacking years, I shared a room with my four brothers.  Oh, how do you...  What?  Two bunk beds in one room.  My poor younger brothers, my twin brothers, they had a share of bed. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, stop it.  They were young.  They didn't know.  They were like five, six.  At that age, that's when the...  You could do it at five or six, you know?  The drain of your shower looks like the little thing at the yogurteria, a little drainage  thing at the...  I don't know what you're going to say.  Because that's really your only alone time as a kid.  My dad was buying a Drano by the case.  What the hell is going on with the cement down here? 
[00:09:30]  At that age, though, that's all you got is the shower.  Really?  Yeah.  Because you're usually shacked up with a brother or something in the bedroom, so you  can't do anything there.  You don't have alone time.  You're not like, hey, I'm going to take off in the car, you know, and go drive somewhere.  There was always places like the woods, but, you know, that's a little risky, going out  in the woods.  Hi, mind if I join you, son?  Who are you?  It's trailing through the woods.  I've noticed you here a few times. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, Christ.  You know, jeep, jeep, jeep.  You don't want that happening.  You can't walk in jeep, jeep, jeep at the same time.  No, you can't.  You run for your life.  You're going to put your arms out in front of you like you're sleepwalking?  Anyway, so getting back to the dream of murder and stuff, it's a good feeling when you realize  that you have woken and it was just a dream.  Yeah, it saved all the legal fees.  I'm going with the other way, too, where it could also be a drag, waking up after having  just a wonderful dream.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  And it ends because your stupid alarm clock goes off.  You're just ready to hook up, and then all of a sudden...  You ever fight to keep your dream going?  Yeah.  You're sort of waking up.  I'm not opening my eyes.  You're sort of waking up, and this hot blonde that's in your dream is slowly fading away,  and you're like, no, no.  Oh, no.  And you're trying to do everything to fight to get back into the dream?  Great.  Turns into Art Carney in a diner.  And you're like, what the fuck happened here?  It's like trying to fight at that turn. 
[00:11:00]  It's like trying to fight Mike Tyson in his prime.  You're just never going to fight yourself back into the dream.  It ain't going to happen.  So helicopters, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  Just one.  Just one helicopter.  More just hovering.  Over Great Neck.  Anybody know?  Anyone in Nassau County?  We've got Nassau County cops.  I don't know.  Can I say, I don't know how you guys jacked in the shower.  I just never did it in my life.  Never in the shower?  Maybe once or twice in 37 years.  Are you in...  Well, you're...  Always in bed, and I would always wipe it on my sheets. 
[00:11:30]  I don't know why.  I swear to God.  See, that's disgusting.  I would wipe it off myself with my own sheets, and then move the sheet off to the side so  the awful part wasn't touching me.  And then I'd just lay back and try to sleep.  It's sheets like a Triscuit.  They were awful.  It looked like I was sleeping under a baked turkey skin.  The shower's just...  I mean, it's got the convenience. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, quick cleanup.  You're right.  It's such easy cleanup.  Except for the glue that gets caught on your legs.  Dude, that stuff never comes out.  Pick it off of your hair later.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  A little balled up.  That was awful.  We might have something on the helicopter.  Jared on Long Island.  What's going on, Eric?  Yeah, you.  What's up, man?  Hey, what's going on?  You're paranoid about an 85-year-old woman that crashed into a gas station up on Lakeville  Road. 
[00:12:30]  Lakeville Road gas station?  Yeah, Lakeville and Hillside.  She crashed right into the pump.  Oh, I saw that on the news.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, but the gas station didn't burst into flames.  Very, very lucky.  Yeah, she slammed her car into a gas station.  Yeah, being paranoid over an 85-year-old woman.  But why would they have a helicopter in the air for that?  News!  Just the news?  Oh, you know what?  What?  What? 
[00:13:00]  Holy shit, dude.  The live shot they had last night on TV was right over your house.  Was it?  You could have done an assault on the media.  I'm trying to look for it.  It all makes sense now, Jared, because I saw the story on the news.  It was an old lady crashed into a gas station, and they had an above-ground shot there.  Yes.  From high above the scene.  How come I can't find it in...  Wow.  Thank you, Jared.  Hey, guys.  Punch it out.  I can't find it on Google News.  Didn't make Google News?  It's kind of cool that that helicopter shot was right above your house. 
[00:13:30]  Whew.  Right above your house.  We're taking fire.  What is this?  You know, I think we've got to get right into it.  The assault on the media last night that No Filter Paul did.  Holy shit.  I didn't see it.  He totally called me.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Well, let me tell you something.  I think we can write off November.  We said that for October, though.  Yeah, but no way.  I cannot see anyone beating this.  Holy shit.  She abandoned the broadcast. 
[00:14:00]  She walked off the set.  She left her little box that they stand on to do their live shot.  She stepped off of it and left in the middle of talking.  In the middle of talking.  She didn't squeeze out enough where the story could continue or anything.  She had to leave.  Yeah, Jimmy, take a look at this because you haven't seen it yet.  No Filter Paul and Friend.  Actually, the friend was the guy that was dressed as the assault on the media guy  at our Halloween party, right? 
[00:14:30]  There we go.  No, she got...  They jump like maniacs.  She just leaves.  She just leaves.  We have the audio, but if you're near a computer right now, go to opandanthony.com.  I believe it's up there.  You've got to see No Filter Paul's latest assault on the media.  An early leader in the assault on the media contest for November.  Yes, Anthony.  But today's show is doing a story.  Make room for Puggles.  Make sure we get the audio for...  New top dog.  For this story.  Make room for Puggles.  It's...  Look at him.  How cute is that? 
[00:15:00]  Could be the cutest little thing I've ever seen.  All it needs is a little happy face Hitler shirt.  Just a fuzzy little cutie pie.  We'll get back to the No Filter Paul thing, but speaking of the Puggles, right?  Yes.  Yesterday, it was on the front page of the New York Post.  Yes, it was.  That's how important of a story it is.  Very popular little doggy is the Pugg mixed with a beagle.  You mix anything with a beagle.  I don't care.  It's coming out adorable.  Look at it.  That is very cute.  His little triangular ears dangling. 
[00:15:30]  I bet if you whistle, they turn their heads sideways and go, and it's the cutest thing.  You know what?  But they don't use a lot of science in this crossbreeding.  How many, like, ugly-ass dogs?  Right.  You know they're, like, trying to, like, combine, like, all sorts of dogs.  That's what I want to see.  Make the next trend.  I want to see the website where they show the disasters they're coming up with.  The genetic disasters that aren't cute.  Which is, like, well, we thought this would work, but the pit-oodle. 
[00:16:00]  The pit-oodle didn't come out too well.  No.  Could you imagine?  Because you know that's what they're doing.  Yeah.  There's no regulations.  We tried a Doberman Opser.  We tried to destroy it.  Just look at it.  It's a mess.  It was scaring the children.  Ah, the puggles are on it today, so.  They have an entire set full of little puggles.  And I have to be honest with you, they smell really good. 
[00:16:30]  I love puppies smell.  They even smell good, little puppies.  The only thing I get nervous about, people either want purebreds or they want these now designer mutts.  I worry about the regular old mutts that are in shelters and things like that.  Don't worry, Matt.  They're simply adorable.  I don't know.  Not everybody has a dog.  It's as fast as a boy.  That's true.  Anyway, we'll be back in a moment.  All right.  I just want to lay in a litter of puggles and pet them.  Wouldn't you just lay down and have their little pointy puppy teeth bite you while they go, 
[00:17:00]  grr, grr.  Aw.  Adorable.  Anyway, it was on the front page of the New York Post yesterday, so there's a follow-up story  in the paper today.  Post sets off, puggle struggle.  Puggle struggle.  There's now a puggle struggle.  What happened?  I know the struggle.  The puggle is now officially a star after the Post put the hot new hybrid cross between  a beagle and a pug on the front page yesterday.  Area pet stores were swamped with people clamoring for the hot new pooch. 
[00:17:30]  I want a puggle.  I must have gotten 100 phone calls this morning from people looking for puggles, says Brian  of some blah, blah puppy place.  Everyone is driving me crazy.  People had the Post in their hands begging for the dogs.  They had the paper there going, one of these.  I need one of these.  My daughter wants a puggle.  That's what they are.  Right.  They're all these rich bitches going in there for their kid that wants it for Christmas.  Mommy, I want a puggle.  I want a puggle. 
[00:18:00]  We'll get you a puggle in her little coffee clotches and we're getting a puggle.  We're getting a puggle this Christmas.  My daughter.  What do you mean you don't have a puggle?  My daughter wants a puggle.  God, you know how many puggles are going to be under the Christmas tree this year?  A little bowl.  Stop it.  Not with a little red bowl around his little neck.  Maybe there's been a gas leak.  So she comes out and she notices her puggle is stiff and doesn't move a lot.  A little puggle-ish thing straight out. 
[00:18:30]  Stop it.  Mama, a stuffed puggle?  Oh, yeah.  Mommy, puggle's cold.  His nose is dry.  Mommy, puggle doesn't want to play.  He's not fetching.  Fetch.  I roll the ball and it just goes over his face and head.  And who's going to be the parent that doesn't find a puggle for their kid so it just settles by getting a pug? 
[00:19:00]  Because it's half puggle?  It's just as good as a puggle.  No, it's not.  I wanted a puggle.  Girl, I hear the puggle's a very mean and nasty dog.  So we just got you a pug.  My friend has a puppy.  She's like a pit bull breed puppy and she lives on the 13th or 14th floor.  Oh, that's lovely.  And her door was open and the puppy ran up onto the roof and they're doing construction and just ran right off the roof. 
[00:19:30]  Holy shit.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow, right off the edge.  A little pit bull puppy.  What is that stupid thing thinking on the way down?  Well, you know what it is.  What is it thinking?  Like, wee.  Probably a little pause of probably moving and looking for like, expecting like something like concrete or whatever to just cushion me under there.  I was just running like puppies do.  And now I'm, uh...  That's great. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, uh...  Come on.  Let's go to Dennis in Virginia.  Hey, man.  Hey, Dennis.  Hey, January.  Everybody, I'll just save their money.  Come January, you'll be able to get them half off at your local shelter as soon as they piss on the floor and piss people off.  That's true.  A lot of times they say you should never get pets for holidays, things like that, birthdays.  I'm going to go on record and say the Puggle is too good to be true.  Too good?  You mean there's some kind of genetic problem?  There's going to be some kind of problem.  Maybe they're not even telling us.  They only live for eight months.  Maybe the Puggle has to... 
[00:20:30]  Just enough to get attached to it.  Maybe the Puggle has to shit every 45 minutes.  But they're not telling anybody.  And it's liquid in butterscotch color.  And it projects.  It shit straight out.  Like a little rocket-propelled Puggle.  Let me tell you what's going to happen.  Because I definitely see into the future with a lot of things.  Predict for us.  It's not even a prediction.  I just see this stuff.  Okay?  Everyone's going to get Puggles.  They're going to be all the rage for the next three or four months. 
[00:21:00]  They're going to be under Christmas trees like you wouldn't believe.  Just like we said.  Well, they should be.  And then the middle of winter.  Oh, no.  February.  Brutally cold here on the northeast, right?  Oh, I see.  That stupid Puggle, because now it's a little older and not as cute,  is going to be chained up in the goddamn backyard.  Shaking.  Just shaking.  As you're inside, it's going to be looking into the windows and the glass doors of your fine home. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  And shut up out there!  And it's not going to be able to look too good,  because it's going to be kind of frosted over those windows,  because there's so much heat inside.  And you're going to be enjoying some TV or a little...  Crackling fire.  Get together with your friends and family,  and the fire's going to be crackling.  Wine.  And the Puggle's going to just be outside looking in.  Pugsy!  How many will name him Pugsy?  Mama, scooter's cold!  Keep him out!  He shit's all over the place! 
[00:22:00]  He's your dog.  You clean it up.  That's what happens with most of these puppies.  The Puggle.  They're cute until they get a little older, and then...  Because it's all about you, isn't it?  I hope Puggles age badly,  and their balls just get really big and heavy,  and drag around everything.  Like, no matter where they go,  there's, like, a slug trail of ball sweat.  There's, like, 18 hairs left on his body.  Looks like one of those, like, Pumba from The Lion King,  one of those damn fucking pig things. 
[00:22:30]  Shitting straight out.  So there's, like, you know, a foot-high,  like, butterscotch-colored lion everywhere in the house,  just all against the walls and the doors and the bed curtains.  Nothing worse than, like, wet, old dog smell.  That's just there.  That's the future of the Puggle.  Look how cute.  It's the latest fad, though.  Or when you scratch his belly,  when you roll him over and scratch his belly,  I hope the Puggle just ejaculates really hard and fast. 
[00:23:00]  Hey, what do we got going on outside our glass today?  Who are these creeps?  We have a show every day.  I'm not talking about the show we do.  Yeah.  We actually have a show outside our window every day.  Well, we have a live audience.  And there's people outside the studio every day on the sidewalk now.  What the hell is going on?  You show up on the sidewalk, you talk to Master Poe,  next thing you know you're sitting ten feet away from us,  checking out the show live.  Yeah, so they're saying the Puggle is like the new designer gene,  the doggy gene that fits just right, Anthony.  Yes, it does. 
[00:23:30]  And there's a waiting list of 60 people for this one breeder.  However, Brooklyn's Puppy Paradise also received more than 100 phone calls  from people looking for the dogs  and is expecting their next Puggle delivery on November 9th.  It's all about the Puggles.  November 9th, another shipment coming in.  You know there's these, like, breeding factories.  I know they have, like, some kind of name for those places  that they just breed and make money out of these things,  and they're just hooking them up, 
[00:24:00]  just trying to get these things to screw so they can...  By the way, which dog gets to fuck?  Is it the pug?  Is the pug mounting the beagle?  Or is the beagle mounting the pug,  and does it make a difference in your Puggle?  Yeah, we need an expert.  We need some type of expert.  When's the next big delivery, November 9th?  Yeah.  November 8th, you're going to hear about some kind of an accident on the LIE,  like a drunk driver barrels into a truck full of Puggles.  Just a flaming truck full of Puggles. 
[00:24:30]  Firemen are there, they're just yelping, they can't get them out.  Better, a school bus hits a truck full of Puggles,  the crying little children, and burning puppies.  Mister, help the Puggles!  People are always trying to figure out what's different about our show than every other show.  Here it is, right here.  Today's show thinks it's the cutest little thing,  and they can't get enough Puggles on their set.  Oh, puppy farms, that's what they call them.  Yeah, they're puppy farms, right?  They call them a puppy farm. 
[00:25:00]  And something like this is just cha-ha-ha-ha-ching.  They are smelling money.  And they know it's a limited thing,  so before people move on from Puggles,  they're going to want to pump out as many of these things as possible.  And you know who suffers?  The Puggle, Opie?  No, not the Puggle.  The Puggle will get the homes.  You go to these pet stores, and there's a bunch of cute little dogs.  Oh, the dogs that aren't Puggles.  The cute dogs that aren't Puggles will sit there in the pet shops, 
[00:25:30]  week after week, getting slightly older every week,  until guess what?  Guess.  Guess.  Well, good.  That's right.  Because you just pinged a little memory in my head from my married life again.  And then one day, it's midnight.  The back door opens.  A guy comes in and empties the cages.  And where do the dogs go?  Where do they go?  Where do the older dogs go?  Where do they go? 
[00:26:00]  They were puppies.  Because then the next morning, they're open for business,  and there's a whole bunch of new cute little dogs in their place.  They're puppies again.  They're puppies again.  What do they do?  What do they do?  Oh, we don't want to think about this, do we, as a society?  But there's a doggy killer out there somewhere.  That works in the middle of the night.  They take the puppies into the back room,  and they put like a little towel around its head,  and they just hit it with a hammer.  Oh, God. 
[00:26:30]  Jesus, man.  This is called make room for Puggle.  We don't need you anymore, stupid.  They're just kicking the dogs out one by one.  Nice hammer on that towel.  Crunchy.  When I was married, the wife decides that this is going to be a great thing to get a dog.  Right.  I guess that'll complete our happy little family.  So, I'm totally against it, because I hate fucking animals in houses. 
[00:27:00]  I hate them.  They ruin your house.  I don't care if you love them.  They're cute.  Puggles are adorable.  Look at me.  I would go out tomorrow and get one.  If you could put a cork in his little ass and tie his dick in a knot,  I'd have a Puggle tomorrow.  It would look like an engorged dick in a week walking around my house.  But I would have one,  and I'd have to pull his teeth out with pliers.  You know, he could ruin those little feet on my couch. 
[00:27:30]  By the way, that's why the Puggle's eyes are so big.  Yeah.  I think the dog has a problem shitting.  Well, we will find out the genetic problems with the Puggle.  In a matter of time.  I hate it.  I hate how they destroy places.  They chew on your walls.  It's just a mess.  And if you let them in the house at all,  I don't care.  Oh, no, he's an outside dog.  No, shut up.  You let him in, pet him under the chin for two seconds,  your couch stinks.  Your whole place smells.  You can walk in and go,  Oh, you own a dog, don't you?  I smell dog. 
[00:28:00]  It just, it's the way it is.  And some people's love can overcome that.  Mine cannot go on.  Short-haired dogs aren't as bad, though.  Aren't as bad.  So what happened?  They're just bad.  So she is like,  I want a dog.  You already had four cats.  I know.  Way to rule your house with an iron fist, by the way.  For someone who hates animals.  Jesus Christ, you had four cats.  I ruled with a lump of ramen noodles.  That's how I ruled my house. 
[00:28:30]  After they were cooked.  She, she just was the boss.  The boss.  Because, God forbid I said anything.  Why are you telling me?  It would start a fight that would just last.  A drunken fight that would go on for days.  Motherfucking, fucking fuck.  And it wouldn't make any sense, and I couldn't sleep.  So, I go, look.  You're going to go down to the North Shore Animal League, wherever the hell she was going, to get a dog. 
[00:29:00]  I go, get something cute.  I don't care what it is, because that's the only way I'll appreciate it for at least a limited time, maybe until I get attached to it.  It's just something.  Just something.  I go, don't let them talk you into an older dog.  What does she come home with?  An older dog.  The thing is full of bad habits.  It's like adopting a crack friggin' teen.  Not even a crack baby.  The thing runs around.  The first thing it does.  You can have fun with a crack teen.  No. 
[00:29:30]  A crack teen you could.  Not a crack dog.  Dog can't go out and suck dick and make some money for the house.  It runs away.  His dog's big, big thing was running away from you.  And you go, come here.  And I can't even remember its name.  Come here.  Come here.  And it would stop and get all excited.  And then the second you get like three feet from it, it takes off down the neighborhood.  I'm chasing it, trying to get it.  And talk about shitting. 
[00:30:00]  Dude, this thing shit everywhere.  All over the house.  Just a shit mess all over the place.  A mutt?  Oh, yeah.  Some kind of fucking collie, Labrador.  There was some German Shepherd in there.  It was just a wreck.  A wreck of a mess of a dog.  And I finally had it and brought it back to the pound.  And hopefully it had just been, not even gassed. 
[00:30:30]  That's too good for this dog.  I like Jimmy's hammer and towel method.  Sometimes it's fun to go to the pound and get puppies and bring them home for a day.  And then go, ha ha, and then bring it back.  I just wanted to show you what you're missing.  Feed it, pet it, love it.  Yeah.  Back you go.  A little soft thing where no other dogs are snipping at it.  And then right back it goes in the cold cage.  Beat it, stupid. 
[00:31:00]  Pizza granny catches convicts.  All right.  Maybe we could see what that's all about this morning as well.  Anyway, the Today Show talking about the...  That is a dog chew on walls.  It eats up the corner bead on your walls, taint licker.  His name is an interesting name.  Why do people question us every day?  Of course.  Dogs chew on walls.  Why do people question us every day?  Why do they question Anthony?  Let's be honest.  Never question me.  Yeah.  I'm only wrong. 
[00:31:30]  I'm wrong quite a bit.  All right.  Here's the Today Show talking about the new craze, the Puggle.  Well, for this one.  Meet Parker.  He's half Pug, half Beagle.  20 years ago, you might have called him a mutt.  But today, he's called a Puggle.  And he's top dog.  Puggles are a so-called hybrid breed that Shari Geisinger first spotted on the streets of New York.  Just walking around the city, I see these cute little dogs with big ears and, you know, the big cute eyes. 
[00:32:00]  And I asked him, well, oh my God, it's the cutest dog.  What is that?  And they said, a Puggle.  Shari knew she just had to have one.  So she found Parker online and bought him from a greeter for $600.  I feel like he's priceless now.  Yeah, he's like my little son.  $600 a Puggle?  All the celebrities are going to be walking around with Puggles now.  Puggles.  It's all about the Puggles.  Angelina Jolie will have one.  Yes.  Their new Puggle.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and their new Puggle. 
[00:32:30]  A foreign baby and a Puggle.  That's what celebrities are going to have.  That's what you need.  All right, listen.  I found the downside of owning a Puggle.  Can't be.  Audio just coming in, Anthony.  The cuteness just offsets everything.  Audio just coming in.  Okay.  There's a downside to everything.  We all know that.  Yeah.  This is what's wrong with the Puggle if you own one.  For many days, I didn't bring him here because I suffer when he bites me.  He bites me in my vagina. 
[00:33:00]  When I'm walking and he sees other dog, he's right away.  He jumps on my vagina because he gets so crazy.  He doesn't know who I am.  He forgets everything.  And he bites the Labrador and his penis.  I don't want him to bite my Labrador and his penis.  My Labrador is a baby.  It's beautiful.  Puggles are biting vaginas.  And other dogs' penises.  Yes, Anthony.  That could be a downside.  This is the downside of the Puggle.  Look at my vagina two times he bites me. 
[00:33:30]  But his teeth are very small.  And they don't damage very much.  They just, they pinch.  Pinching and biting vaginas.  They pinch.  Yes.  More audio from the Today Show.  Talking about the Puggles today.  Come on.  It's a simple case of supply and demand.  According to recent statistics, Puggles now account for 50% of all mixed breed sales.  In fact, pet stores across the country can't keep them in stock. 
[00:34:00]  These guys are like as popular as, should we say, Yankee tickets during season.  It was the Labradoodle from Australia that started this hybrid trend over a decade ago.  Mixed breeds instantly became a hit.  And now the Puggle has reached designer doggy status.  All right.  Mixing the breeds is a hit, but there's some disasters out there.  Right.  What happens to them?  Someone direct me to a website where they talk about the disasters.  The little ones that don't come out as cute as the Puggle. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, because the government's not getting involved.  No, there's no regulations.  They're just crossbreeding everything.  They're both two dogs in a room.  The shepherd dachshund that kills itself because it scrapes its huge cock on the ground and dies.  The Puggle.  There are probably places, I swear to you, just running around looking for beagles and pugs just to throw them together.  That's what, like, the beagle pug population is probably tight right now. 
[00:35:00]  Probably hard to find them to throw them in a room and get them banging so you can make a buck.  $600 for a Puggle.  The litters, how big is a litter usually?  Six, seven, eight.  I'd say, yeah.  You do a little math there.  I'll go with five.  I don't want to even attempt.  What?  Five times six hundred is at least $3,000.  No, 600 times 10, that would be $6,000.  Then you split it in half is $3,000.  That's what I said.  Oh, it is?  I'm a math guy. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah?  You're a brain guy with everything else.  I should have been a mathematician.  Oh.  That's what they said in high school when I took that test.  I think there's a leap between figuring out 600 times.  Not really, because you had a real tough time there, my pal.  Yeah, I know.  I think in the middle of the night they're stealing pugs and beagles from apartments.  Oh.  Pugs and beagles.  Watch.  You're absolutely right.  Is your beagle safe? 
[00:36:00]  Beagles and pugs being taken from your home?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're predicting the future right now.  Yeah.  This is what you're going to hear.  Just wait for that news tease.  Absolutely.  Pugs and beagles are going to be taken.  The news will take this cute phenomenon that is the puggle.  Yeah.  And they'll make a disaster out of it somehow.  They'll make it scary, dangerous.  That's right.  That's right.  Start taping the news.  Lots of children getting puggles this holiday season.  Is there a danger?  We'll let you know.  The hidden danger in the puggle. 
[00:36:30]  Actually, puggles on the Today Show pros and cons.  Pros and cons.  So is getting a mixed breed really a good idea?  New York veterinarian Kim Rosenthal says hybrid pooches have some advantages.  I absolutely love the idea of mixing breeds.  I think that we can really look for the best characteristics in each breed and start to eliminate some of the medical problems that have been plaguing us for a very long time.  Of course, this new wave of dog breeding has some purists snarling.  And critics fear that the fast-growing trend may lead to overzealous breeding. 
[00:37:00]  But for now, Sherry is enjoying her little guy.  He's like, you know, like a best friend, like a little kid.  And he's great.  He's great to play with and snuggle with and just to keep you company.  And they called it Pug-A-Log.  Pug-A-Log.  Ask them if they want to help save this country from the onslaught of integration.  You know, the system is they want to throw white children and colored children into the building part of integration. 
[00:37:30]  Throughout of which will come a conglomerated, the latter, Mongol class of people.  All of races will be destroyed in such a movement.  Time for one.  After God will die before I yield one inch.  And that time is a movement.  Hello, exactly.  They're destroying the Puggles.  No, the Pugs.  And the Beagles.  And the Beagles.  And the Pugs, if you're caught with a Beagle, they'll start calling you Beagle Lover. 
[00:38:00]  Don't bring no Beagle home, honey.  Brought a Beagle home.  Wow.  We just look at animals differently, don't we?  Yes, absolutely.  But you will be seeing the horror stories that come out.  Of course.  Because the news cannot leave it as a cutesy little story, can it?  Of course.  Every time the Puggle sneezes, there's some kind of a chemical thing where it just sprays HIV all over the room. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  The Puggle flew.  No filter, Paul is on hold.  Hey, Paul.  Good morning, guys.  We're going to take care of you after the break.  You're a big star.  I appreciate that.  Thank you, bud.  I've got to take a leak or we'll go right to you.  Who got me a Puggle?  All right.  Hold on a minute.  We'll talk to No Filter, Paul.  He had an amazing assault on the media yesterday.  Yes.  An amazing one.  And Anthony's already saying that no one's going to beat this for November.  It's the winner.  I don't know what you're going to have to do.  This assault on the media thing is now really taking off to the next level.  So I think even though No Filter, Paul had an amazing one, I bet you right now, Anthony, $100, someone beats it. 
[00:39:00]  You know what?  The only way I can see anyone beating his assault on the media, if they get behind the reporter holding the cutest little dog, the Puggle.  That's right.  Right behind the reporter.  Could you imagine that?  The reporter would probably just stop the story to go, what a cute little dog that is.  It's merely adorable.  But you have to be yelling, Opie and Anthony, and you have to be holding five Puggles.  You have to be like one by their asshole, one on each finger, and you have to be waving them and yelling, Opie and Anthony, Opie and Anthony, with a handful of Puggles. 
[00:39:30]  XM, satellite radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, pop them all off and have the reporter sniff your finger.  You know, as we...  Just lob Puggles at the reporter.  That's right.  Or maybe a baggie full of severed Puggle feet.  You have to dangle that by the reporter's face.  All right.  Little Puggle feet.  Puggle feet.  How could such a horrible bag full of bloody, furry mess be so cute? 
[00:40:00]  I don't know.  Little feet.  The little pads are undamaged.  The little pink pads that smell like puppy.  That's awful.  I know.  Oh, by the way, Opie.  Yeah.  Some...  I got some weird email I brought to Steve.  Midge me sent...  Midge me.  Midge me, yeah.  Sent some, uh...  Sent some, uh...  Midge me.  Sent some, uh... 
[00:40:30]  Midge me.  I'm quite familiar with that name.  No, no, no.  I just...  I don't really get...  There's a character in California who's been taking shits and taking pictures of them.  Midge me.  I can't figure out the puzzle.  There's no puzzle.  I just understand that there's...  Midge me thing the last couple of days.  It's like a wordy-girdy.  It's a wordy-girdy, sure.  Anthony, as we go to break, um, off our Dementor World CD, this track could have been a lot  better, but Dave Dickless, back in the day, decided to edit out God and Damn and...  Or he just...  He edited out God.  I said God Damn during this bit. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, I think his wife is a religious woman.  And I was...  She used to, like, bitch to him about our show.  I was cursing the Almighty Father.  Yes, you were.  During this, uh, bit about my old dog, Fresca.  Fresca!  And it made our Dementor World CD, but I'll be honest, I don't think it's one of the better  tracks, unfortunately, but I think there's still a few chuckles in here.  I just think it's an interesting little story that people probably have also gone through  with their own dogs.  This is a good example of how Dave really fucked with our CD back in the day, though, I gotta 
[00:41:30]  tell you.  Editing for his own personal reasons instead of, uh, general reasons, I guess.  You're, uh, narrowing down things on the speculation thread by talking about Dave Douglas  like this.  Speculation thread.  Uh, thread.  Thread on the thread, right.  Message board, yeah.  Some guy has...  Well, we'll play this after the break, too.  Mm-hmm.  Speculation trailer.  It's not really a trailer by this guy, Tom.  Mm-hmm.  The whole speculation thing is taken off. 
[00:42:00]  Yes.  And now people are making little production pieces.  Very nice.  And this one's really good.  Maybe we'll get a few more over the weekend.  You never know.  Maybe this will be the new bit that the listeners could jump on.  I don't know.  A friend in need is a friend in deed, as you said yesterday, right?  That's not what I said.  There's something like that.  I can't quite remember.  I said, in radio, your friends become your enemies, and your enemies become your friends.  It wasn't exactly the, uh, I have a dream speech. 
[00:42:30]  Right.  Yeah.  But in real life, your enemies never become your friends, really.  But in radio, it happens all the time.  Sports, it does.  In sports, it does as well.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Uh, from Demento World, my dog Fresca, as we go to break.  Dude, I got a very similar story.  We had a, we had a colleague.  Are you?  All right.  By the way, shut up.  There you go.  I'm not going to.  Right when Ovi shut the mic up, I go, oh my God, they're going to crucify you.  And I only heard three words. 
[00:43:00]  Look.  His, his voice.  Back in the day, we were, uh, working with what's called reel-to-reel tape.  Reel-to-reel tape, Ovi.  And I believe, uh, they, they needed to kind of fine-tune the mechanism.  Right.  And our voices happened to be, uh, sped up a little bit.  There was a thing, a pitch knob.  A pitch knob.  Thank you, Anthony.  The pitch knob on it.  I'm going with the pitch knob theory.  And sometimes the tapes would stretch and think, it would just, it's an archaic technology  that would, at times, make your voice sound higher, sometimes lower. 
[00:43:30]  Would it really?  It never happened to Wolfman Jack.  No, it didn't.  That is great.  Hey!  Hey, guys!  Sounds like Jimmy acting.  Hey, where are you going?  If you listen closely to the Hindenburg thing.  Yeah.  Oh, get out of the way!  It's pitched a little too high.  That guy, the, uh, actual digital recording.  Um, people, please, clear the area.  There's a dirigible crashing.  Oh, my God.  Get out of the way. 
[00:44:00]  All right, well.  I guess we don't have to play this.  Sound like a hungry little puggle.  I guess we just don't have to.  No!  No!  You can't put that away!  You have to hear it.  The people want to hear it.  I think people get the point.  How many, how many words actually came out?  Because the instant feedback, oh, my God, this is a classic example of high-pitched voice Opie.  High-pitched Opie, a new character.  Holy fake radio Opie high voice.  It's not fake.  It's just the way the recording was done. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  We hate to admit this, but we've been at this a long time now.  We've been doing this together for, I think, about 11 years now.  Remember when our pubes grew in?  Oh, shit.  Right after we recorded this.  Oh, well, here you go.  Go on, let's hear it.  Somebody better print up all the instant feedback, because I'm sure it's just going to be a treat when we get back.  Just a treat for everybody.  Dude, I got a very similar story.  We had a collie growing up, Fresca. 
[00:45:00]  It was the collie, you know, that we had when we were all, like, you know, five, six years old, okay?  Like the little lapty.  Yeah, 15 years go by.  Now the dog's really old, okay?  Yeah.  We notice it has a bump on its rear, a little cyst, okay?  We take it to the vet, and the doctor decides we better remove the cyst from the 17-year-old dog.  We're going to put him under.  He'll be here an hour, and you'll have Fresca back home.  He'll be patched up.  Give him a little treat.  Everything will be fine, okay?  This vet, same thing with anesthesia. 
[00:45:30]  Next thing you know, we get a call, like, anxiously awaiting to bring Fresca home from our lovely vet.  This can't be good.  Phone rings, and we're all excited, like, hey, we got his dog treats, the water, everything is cool.  Vet goes, uh, uh, we have some bad news.  Fresca died.  He died.  He killed my damn dog.  Because of the cyst?  Because of a cyst.  If we left it alone, the dog would have lived another two or three years. 
[00:46:00]  It wasn't bothering him, but the vet insisted he had to take the cyst off Fresca.  Unbelievable.  So now we have to pick up dead Fresca.  Thank you.  Because we're not going to pay the money for him to take care of the dog.  Oh, yeah.  So my dad carries it and puts it in our little, uh, lovely station wagon with the panel siding, you know.  And now we have to deal with dead Fresca.  So my dad goes and takes his little ride.  Two hours later, he comes home with, uh, no Fresca.  He probably dropped it off in the woods somewhere. 
[00:46:30]  In the woods.  There's our lovely dog in the woods somewhere after living 17 damn years.  You should have left him alone.  Should have left him alone.  And same thing, a bill comes in the mail.  We've got to now pay, uh, the vet for killing Fresca.  What the hell is going on?  Little Fresca.  Little freaking Fresca.  Uh, Anthony, remember the jet blue, that, uh, crazy landing?  Of course.  The audio's finally coming out. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, it did?  Of that landing.  What did you see on the gear?  From the tower perspective, the gear was canted 90 degrees to the left instead of the tires being aligned down the runway.  Thank you.  That's all we needed to know.  There are people that work at a deli that I've seen lose their mind when the slicer breaks, you know?  What the fuck?  I got sandwiches.  Bernie, fix this fucking...  This guy, his plane is fucked up.  He's got a hundred and some odd people behind him. 
[00:47:30]  All right, thanks for the info.  We'll get back to you.  And the thing is, he didn't have to be that cool.  No.  So that's legitimate, that's sincere, righteous coolness.  Coolness, yeah.  Because no one hears it.  Because no one else is.  Exactly.  Yeah.  He could have been like, what the...  Oh, shit.  Oh, no.  Does anyone know what we do when this happens?  No.  He just...  All right.  Oh, damn.  Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.  Any way to straighten this out?  Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn. 
[00:48:00]  I saw a movie once.  They dropped Charlton Heston through the roof.  Can someone do that so I don't have to fly this fucking thing?  Oh, boy.  Because I don't have a clue how you deal with a situation like this.  Ladies and gentlemen, is anybody in our Atlanta plane with a wheel or a stud?  Yeah.  Right.  Just come on up.  All right.  It's going to be...  Can somebody hijack this plane so we have an excuse for this moment?  Ladies and gentlemen, we just got information.  Our wheel is canted at 90 degrees.  Yeah.  It's turned 90 degrees to one side of it. 
[00:48:30]  So we're going to land this thing.  You see, there's going to be a little bit of sparks.  We're going to be fine.  We're going to be on a 500 mile an hour sit and spin.  So I'll just sit back and I'll get back to you.  That's what I'm going to do.  Get back to you.  Excuse me, stewardess.  Uh, what the fuck does canted mean?  That would be the...  Yeah, I thought we had a problem, but apparently we don't.  The wheels just seem to be canted.  Which, uh, I guess is fine.  I'm going to whisper.  Excuse me, I don't want to... 
[00:49:00]  What the fuck is canted?  I know there's a lot of people working on PCs out there.  Could someone just punch up dictionary.com?  Can you Google?  C-C-A-N.  Google canted.  And then it's starting to think, say, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think canted means twisted sideways, nigga.  Now I punched a nigga in the face and his jaw was canted.  Now how the fuck...  This nigga have a canted jaw?  You telling me somebody done punched the motherfucking wheels on this plane? 
[00:49:30]  So you saying the wheels is like this nigga's jaw?  Canted?  The motherfuckers canted?  Sir, calm down, please, sir.  Fuck you!  I told that nigga I knocked up.  Nigga, your jaw's canted.  He was all fucked up.  And that nigga couldn't land.  He crashed right on the sidewalk.  That nigga crashed on his fucking fake line, knocked him up in his jaw, and it was canted. 
[00:50:00]  Miss, miss, miss, we are fucked up, ma'am.  Holy shit.  Talking to his neighbor.  You know he's fucked up.  This shit's canted.  I canted a nigga before.  Holy shit.  I got a kid.  God damn that pilot is a genius.  God bless that guy, man.  Cool motherfucker.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:50:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Oh, my goodness.  The instant feedback rolling in on that bit we played before going to break, Opie. 
[00:51:00]  The fresca bit from, I don't know, ten years ago.  Yeah, about.  Hey, Opie, did you do that radio shift after school?  Ants, it sounds like Opie still had marshmallow pinched in his little blonde fuzzy cheeks.  You ass.  You chick.  Opie, with the combination of the high-pitched audio and saying, but, and the Boston accent, 
[00:51:30]  fake Boston accent makes for cringe gold.  And they're calling, they're saying, so back in the day it was the Opie show with Anthony  the Hole.  Why were you just laughing?  I guess I was just going, oh, gosh.  Really?  Yeah, believe me, I was just happy to be there.  We weren't trying to do fake Boston accents.  We were up there a while, so maybe we picked up a thing or two. 
[00:52:00]  I don't know.  You're an ass thing.  Over-eager first show?  That was very over-eager.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe we'll do a little of that today.  Oh, no.  We don't need to do that at all.  Well, I only hear Ant laughing at everything and just being happy to be there.  Shut up.  Where's the first show?  You still have it?  No.  It's the Opie and happy to be here show.  We tried to play the first show that Ant and I did together.  I'm going to leave like a quarter for the insult on the media.  And we got two minutes into it, and both Anthony and I could not listen anymore. 
[00:52:30]  Can't take it.  But one day we're just going to have to just let them pile on Ant.  We're going to have to get Vossen here and Patrice and just let them have at it.  How about we do that the next time you're in town, Jimmy?  I agree.  Next time.  The next time.  So we have a couple weeks to prepare for it.  But can we have like a little audio now just to hear it a little bit?  Oh, why?  Well, Eric.  It's just.  Eric.  Eric's too organized sometimes.  Eric, just leave that out here because eventually we're going to get to it.  Just leave it in my pile of stuff.  It might even be there, Eric.  You're right. 
[00:53:00]  If it is, I will apologize to you live on the show.  No.  Eric.  Is it there?  Mm-hmm.  That was the first question.  Uh-huh.  Is that it right there?  What a nervous Nelly he is.  Yeah, just find and leave it here because eventually we will get to it again.  All right?  Yeah, eventually.  Eventually.  I just want to hear a little bit of it.  Excuse me.  It's horrible.  Hi.  Hi.  All right.  Anyway, let's move on.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm happy.  I'm just a little bit of your ass.  I am just to be there. 
[00:53:30]  I'm so happy.  So it's a little windy.  Yeah, my head blew up.  Yeah.  You didn't say that.  Oh, no.  Good morning, America.  They can't be outdone by the Canadian show.  Are we taping this?  Because now they got a puggle on.  There's a puggle on Good Morning America.  The puggle is making the rounds.  The puggle is making, yes, morning TV today.  How cold it is.  There's a little kid flipping pizza dough.  What the?  God, no one's original anymore.  I guarantee Regis.  This kid's rocking with his pizza dough.  He's breakdancing with pizza dough.  And he keeps dropping it. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, that's good.  Stinks.  Wrap the puggle up in.  Feed it to the homeless.  Pick a blanket.  Puggle on a blanket.  Starts to get hot in the oven.  Hear the puggle yelping.  Not for long, though.  Diane Sawyer.  This is fatso.  Oh, no.  This is Tyra Banks.  Tyra Banks in a fat suit doing the how do people treat fat people gag.  Yeah.  Poorly.  That's pretty much.  I don't think she has to dress in a fat suit to figure it out.  Fat people are treated poorly. 
[00:54:30]  Exactly.  Because they're fat and they're inconvenient.  How about this?  Stop hogging up two seats.  Right.  There you go.  You're fat.  You ever notice you've never once heard anyone go, hey, don't be fat in that open field.  Hey, you.  Don't be fat across the street.  Don't be fat in your own home.  I don't give a shit if you eat until your fat heart just falls out.  I don't care if you sneeze and your heart comes out like a miscarriage.  They've got to take one of those forklifts and take you out the side of your house to take you to the hospital. 
[00:55:00]  You'll never hear me complaining.  Right.  Have a nice ride, fatso.  Like a missile being taken on a train.  They've got to just throw you in the back of a flatbed and throw a towel over you.  You don't fit in the ambulance.  I don't care.  But when you're close, being in proximity to fat people is when we hate you.  It's when you're on a plane.  Or a bus.  Bus.  Fat.  We've got no filter, Paul.  He's been on hold for like an hour.  So last night, I'm just doing my thing.  Actually, I was watching the Islander game, and they sucked last night big time. 
[00:55:30]  Fucking Penguins.  I beat the Islanders bad.  Made them look silly on their home eyes.  Oh, no.  Anyway, there's hockey talk.  It was March of the Penguins toward the Nets last night.  Anyway, and then I get a communique.  A communique from Anthony.  A very rare communique.  Well, I couldn't do anything because there were helicopters over my house.  I was very worried.  Right.  So I couldn't go near the windows.  So I was just communicating. 
[00:56:00]  So I got a communique on my Blackberry, my Crackberry.  And something about an assault on the media that Anthony just saw.  Or saw an hour or two ago, I guess.  Yes.  And said it was no filter, Paul, and you watched it, what, like 100 times?  I couldn't stop watching it.  Because I ended up watching it at least 100 times.  I had it on just a continuous loop.  I was just looking at it over and over and over again.  Anthony, in this communique, wrote,  this will win the Assault in the Media contest for November, 
[00:56:30]  even though it's, what, November 4th or something like that?  Yeah, it's a whole month left, but they just pulled it off.  It was the perfect one.  They didn't touch the reporter, yet they made her leave her post.  She deserted her post.  Not even like, all right, let's go to tape or anything.  She just walked away in the middle of talking  because these maniacs started jumping up and down behind her,  screaming, Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio, and just frightened her.  They were very aggressive.  They came running in, screaming, Opie and Anthony, and XM Satellite Radio, 
[00:57:00]  and jumping up with their hands in the air.  Jumping up and down.  And she thought for a split second, can I work in this atmosphere, and said, no, I can't.  And then the funniest part is that she stepped off a box.  Yeah, she's on a box.  I guess she's really short or something, and they needed to give her some height for the shot.  And then she just stepped off and walked away.  Walked away.  And then for a second or two, these two pests had the live shot.  I just saw it again.  All to themselves.  We see it and hear it? 
[00:57:30]  Just screaming.  Yeah, here it is.  So, we got the audio.  The video's up on opianthony.com.  Do yourself a favor.  This one is definitely worth searching out.  Definitely worth searching out.  It's getting downloaded like crazy already, by the way.  But here it is.  Jimmy's about to see it for the first time.  This is crazy.  There.  She just walks.  She kind of looks over at both of them quickly.  Like, real quick.  And then looks down and makes sure her footing is right, getting off the box, and just steps off. 
[00:58:00]  Leaves the shot.  Leaves the shot, yes.  And they cut right back to the anchor woman at the desk.  Right.  So, let's go to the audio.  You know, the audio doesn't do it justice, in my opinion, because they look like lunatics jumping up and down.  Yeah.  And someone commented on Whack Bag that it was really funny, because you know these guys are short in real life,  and they're only jumping off the ground maybe an inch.  Yeah.  Which makes it funny, too.  Yeah, I can't see Paul jumping too high.  Yeah, here we go.  Now, once again, the musicians say they're...  Okay, we had a problem there, and Stacey got out of the way. 
[00:58:30]  So, that was Stacey Sager reporting live from Midtown.  Jimmy, you're wrecking the flow of the show by passing that out now.  I just wanted to show up.  We're trying to do one thing at a time here, and now we can't even talk about the assault of the media,  because you horrified Anthony.  Talk about it.  How do I go back to this now?  Paul?  Now we have to talk about the pictures you're handing out to everybody.  We'll talk about them in a bit. 
[00:59:00]  I'm just going to flip that over, so I don't have to look at it.  So, Paul?  How do we go back to Paul?  You're wrecking the flow.  No, it'll work.  Speaking of flow, it looks like you have a nice flow in those pictures.  Oh, wow.  Anyway, so, why do we have an edited version of this, by the way?  It's edited?  Well, it's, you know, you need the build-up, because, you know, you've got to hear the seriousness of the story.  They're talking to this lady out there, because what's going on down there in Times Square, the musicians are on strike, 
[00:59:30]  so you've got the Rockettes, they're just dancing to a CD, basically.  To record music, but no one cared.  Right, so they talk to a violinist, I guess, who's on strike, and she was very, very sad and upset,  and then it goes back to the live shot, and then the destruction.  Because people were saying it was a great show, and it sounded great,  because actually people didn't realize it was even a CD of music.  All right, so we're going to get a longer version of this,  because that's what makes this fun, is the setup before you get the destruction, the anticipation. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Because it shows you they're trying to do their jobs, and then it's completely just disrupted.  But once again, here's the audio from last night.  Now, once again, the musicians say they're...  Okay, we had a problem there, and Stacey got out of the way.  So that was Stacey Sager reporting live from Midtown.  How sick of the pests is the media going to get?  Oh, my God.  That's our goal.  There was a time that this whole assault on the media thing was kind of waning. 
[01:00:30]  It was just kind of almost going away, but now we're on a major uptick.  A major uptick.  It's a tear, yes.  Yeah.  Yes, it's exploding again.  Poor Stacey.  And they're getting more aggressive and vicious.  Good.  Remember, don't touch the reporters.  That's when we're going to get in trouble.  Just do your thing.  Just do your thing with the bullhorns and the screaming and the jumping up and down  and the pulling out of the hair.  The yelling is just insanity. 
[01:01:00]  My favorite part is when they go back to the studio and the lady...  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I've got to think on my feet here.  What do I say?  Looks like there was a problem out there, and she took care of the situation.  No, she didn't.  She walked off her post.  Paul always sounds like he's screaming and crying at the same time.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to No Filter Paul.  He's a star today on the Opie and Anthony program once again.  Hello.  Paul does a lot for this radio show, I've got to tell you.  He's annoying as hell, but he does a lot for this show. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, Paul.  If you want to see the full version, you can actually go to abc7ny.com,  click on Eyewitness News, and view the video regarding the strike at Radio City Musical.  They have the whole report, including our assault.  They have it up on their own website?  Fucking idiots.  This whole six minutes is up there with us at the end of it.  There must be some kind of system put in place where, all right,  the tape from the road gets put on the website, and they don't have any contingency plans for this.  So, Paul, walk us through what happened. 
[01:02:00]  Okay.  Well, we heard Danny in the morning trying to pull off the assaults up there,  so that's how we figured out we should go up there.  And I met up with Bam, Aaron, and the assault on the media guy.  His name is Mike.  Yeah, Mike's on the other line, by the way, listening in.  Okay, cool.  I'm right here.  Yeah.  And so we just sat there, and we waited to see what the reporters were at.  Pretty much every studio was there, and the reason the woman was on a box  is because all the camera angles were pointing up to the Radio City Musical sign.  Okay.  Everybody was on a box.  It wasn't just her.  Okay. 
[01:02:30]  And Fox 5 came on, and we decided that we wouldn't have enough time to run around  because they were all inside, like, a gated area.  Yeah.  So we stood at this little gap, and we just waited for the Channel 7.  Channel 7 had a monitor underneath the camera so we could see what was going on,  and as soon as she came back from the video, we jumped in there  and decided to pull off the old gay cheerleader assault on the media.  Gay cheerleader.  Yeah, you guys jumping up and down is very, very funny.  It looked like a couple of cunts, whatever.  It looks like you're getting off the ground maybe an inch, maybe two inches. 
[01:03:00]  Let me tell you, it was considerably further than that.  Yeah, sure.  I'll tell him what the box she was on.  Come on.  Okay, whatever.  How great was it?  It was a complete victory because she walked off.  She didn't even finish her story, and then you guys had the camera to yourself,  the live shot to yourself for about a second.  Yeah, and they had no one in the truck.  It was just the camera guy and her.  Yeah.  So the actual truck guy from Fox 5 came out behind us and just looked  and just said, fuck it, and went back in his truck. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, the Fox 5 guy didn't want to help her out?  Yeah, he's like, hold on, that's Channel 7, fuck it.  Did anyone say anything to you?  Not at all.  We actually just did a lap around the block and came around back to the other side  to try and hit another one.  Yeah.  And the reporter, it was Channel 4, we were trying to get on the national news at 6.30.  They saw us and decided to tape their shit and leave.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we were at their wedding.  She was doing all the prep, and then the cops were pointing at us and stuff.  It seems like ABC here in New York is the easiest target. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  There's been a lot of assaults on ABC 7 here in New York.  They're going to put some things in place, I'm sure.  They send out security with their people.  I can't believe they didn't even have a truck guy, so it was like just them.  And what did the lady do after the shot was cut?  Nothing.  She just kind of what?  She just stood by the camera guy and looked at us, and we just walked away.  Oh, wow.  Tell you what, not a fucking word.  Wow.  This is a walk of shame.  Did you hear Bam's contribution to it, his little trumpet?  He was trying to get in the background with a trumpet. 
[01:04:30]  I heard about that, but you can't really see it.  There's a guy playing a trumpet.  Yeah, he'll get upset if I don't mention that, because his fat ass didn't get on the TV.  Yeah, oh, it didn't get on the TV.  You can see his arm if you look.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's like a gray.  It happens very quickly.  And you can hear it.  Yeah, you can hear the trumpet for a second.  We'll look for that later.  Why does the camera shake?  That's the camera guy jumping out from behind the camera to wave the reporter out of the shot.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yep.  I thought, because you screamed really loud, that the camera just got jilted. 
[01:05:00]  Like, ah!  It got a little, uh...  Because it got shaky, and then she just walked off her box, and then you guys were left there.  No, the cameraman was probably, yeah, holding the camera.  On the live shot.  Yeah, that's true.  I got to lose a couple of pounds if that camera's shook because of me.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Paul, I got to tell you, man.  Well, you guys said this last month, so I know Sonny Farrelly's probably out buying a puggle as we speak.  Yeah, Sonny Farrelly, he's got a dynasty happening in Boston.  He won September and October.  I don't think he's going to win November.  Yeah, we'll wait until 11.59 on the last day in November before we confirm that one. 
[01:05:30]  I think the assault on the Media Cup comes back to New York in November.  It's looking good for you.  Boston's had it for the last couple of months, but I think it comes back to New York City.  Yeah, you guys mentioned it before, but the other guy that was with me was, you know,  the assault on the media guy from the Halloween party.  He hadn't actually done an assault on the media before that.  It was my first one.  Yeah.  Did Mike have anything to add?  No, he pretty much covered it, except what was really funny was when they went back to the studio,  we could see on the monitor, and the anchor was totally flustered. 
[01:06:00]  And then they cut to her, and she didn't know what to do at all.  It was really funny.  She, like, looks down, looks at you.  She's trying to figure out, should I continue, and then goes, ah, fuck it.  And just walks off.  That's my favorite part of the whole thing.  It's too bad I didn't have my costume on yesterday.  That would have been really good on.  Oh, that would have been really, really funny.  Definitely.  Hey, we need a trophy shop.  Hmm.  You know, we need a trophy shop where it's like assault on the media winners,  and then it's like September 2005, and then the winner, and then October 2005. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, you want, like, with little plaques on it?  Yeah, and then we have to get it engraved every month.  That'd be huge.  Well, what about different divisions?  Because I'm in the novice division since it was my first one.  No, we can't get confused with all that.  I don't have any details.  National and local.  National and local.  There's some breakout stars with this assault on the media thing.  You got No Filter, Paul.  You got Sonny Farrelly and the Boston Strangler in Boston, and then you got Buffalo Paul.  Yeah.  Those are the standout guys right now.  Well, I have to admit it's, like, addictive, because then you're thinking, oh, how could  it be better next time? 
[01:07:00]  And that's what I've been thinking about all night.  That's what a lot of these guys are saying.  It gets addictive.  It's like a rush.  It's great.  It's definitely a rush, especially when you realize they can't do anything to you.  No.  We have found a loophole in this whole live shot thing.  Nothing.  They cannot do a thing to you.  It lasts about 10 seconds, but then you're, like, energized right afterwards, and you're like,  huh, where's the other camera?  Where's the other camera?  Yeah, it's just like that first hit, man.  They're addictive.  It's like that first hit.  All right.  Congratulations, guys.  It's Mike from Queens.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  Good job. 
[01:07:30]  And family, Mr. Trumpet.  And the trumpet.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to go watch the video again to see if I hear the trumpet.  Oh, you definitely hear it.  It's right at the end, and it's really funny if you're listening for it.  All right.  Let's listen for it.  And the video's up on opianthony.com and whackbag.com and everywhere else, foundrymusic.com.  All right, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks again, man.  Not a problem.  There he goes.  No filter, Paul.  Big star today.  Big star.  Once again, here's the audio of the latest assault on the media. 
[01:08:00]  And this is the current leader, Anthony.  Ah, come on.  Now, once again, the musicians say there.  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Okay.  We had a problem there, and Stacey got out of the way.  Wait, I've got to listen for the trumpet again.  Yeah, I talked over the reporter.  Now, once again, the musicians say there.  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Oh, get out to the XLC!  Okay, we had a problem there, and Stacey got out of the way.  So, that was Stacey Sager reporting live from Midtown. 
[01:08:30]  By the way, really fast, another assault on the media came in from Boston.  Mike from Boston versus Fox 25 outside the TD Bank North Center, formerly the Fleet Center, I guess.  It's pretty funny.  Is it funny?  Yeah, I saw this one.  I don't know how it holds up audio-wise, but video-wise, visually, it's pretty funny.  I think this was from last month, unfortunately.  We just got the video in.  Yeah, the guy is holding up an Opie and Anthony sign.  He's got, like, a homemade sign behind this guy that's apparently holding up someone's jersey. 
[01:09:00]  And then he decides to cover the guy's sign with the jersey.  He goes, let's hold it up over here.  And then the guy with the sign just goes to the other side and becomes a little battle.  Oh, and then the guy drags him out of the shot.  Yeah, drags him out of the shot.  Is there any audio to this, or is he yelling and screaming or anything?  You could kind of hear him.  He wasn't close enough to the mic.  Number 25, Celtic great.  There's so many great numbers, but there you go.  Shouldn't that say Fox on top? 
[01:09:30]  Fox 25?  No, we didn't want the Rick Fox confusion there.  That's true.  So it was, let me just hold that up right over there, Gino.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Let me hold this up right over there.  Hold it up over the sign.  Shouldn't that say Fox on it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll show 25.  Well, the video is definitely better than the audio we have.  The video is up on foundrymusic.com and opianthony.com as well, okay?  But there you have it, the latest on the assault on the media thing. 
[01:10:00]  No filter, Paul.  Definitely in the lead.  He's the man to beat.  Let's see.  Mike in Michigan.  What's up, Mike?  Hey, guys.  How you doing today?  Hey, Mike.  Pretty good, Mike.  Hey, you know, I understand, and I think it's pretty cool because I think the media needs to  be assaulted, but what's the whole reason why you do it?  Is it because the media was fucking you guys over a couple years ago when you got booted?  Well, there's a combination of things.  Yeah, I got a real hatred for the local media here in New York after we fucked up because 
[01:10:30]  they got so much shit wrong.  Very pompous.  So I lost a lot of respect for them, and then if you really pay attention to what they're  really trying to accomplish with the local news and the national news, you realize they're  not trying to accomplish anything except just scare the shit out of us and get us to  watch for ridiculous reasons so they can sell their stupid commercials and make a lot  of money.  Well, I think it's great.  One of these days I'm going to break out and do it.  One of these days I'll do assault on the media here in Michigan.  They're not doing anything useful.  Trust me.  They really aren't.  No, those live shots are ridiculous, too. 
[01:11:00]  Unnecessary.  Besides that, XM really hasn't come to the plate and marketed our show.  I mean, they're starting here and there.  There's a little ad in the Daily News today here in New York, which is kind of flattering.  And then there's a big pullout in the latest issue of Us Magazine I saw last night where  we're prominently displayed.  So it's getting a little better.  But this all started because we couldn't wait for XM to promote our show.  Anthony and I, the one thing a lot of people will talk about about us, we know how to 
[01:11:30]  promote ourselves.  We're really good at promoting ourselves.  So we couldn't wait for XM.  So we said, you know what?  We don't really like the media and they're sitting ducks out there with these live shots.  So why don't we assault the media and get our names out there and people will realize  that we're doing the satellite radio thing.  Well, guys can't wait until I pop into work so I can turn my computer on so I can go on  to XM and listen to you guys, crowd around my office and listen to you guys.  So you're hilarious.  We love you.  Thanks, Mike.  I appreciate it.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  Thank you, sir. 
[01:12:00]  Mike in Michigan.  So there you go.  That's pretty much it, you know.  Apparently we have a billboard up.  There's a billboard alert.  I saw an actual Opie and Anthony XM billboard in Syosset on the train overpass on Jericho  Turnpike out on Long Island.  All right.  Just amazing, the guy says.  So it's getting a little better.  Yeah.  A little better, right?  It's getting out there.  What's wrong?  Nothing at all.  Just looking at this brilliant advertising thing, actually.  What are you talking about?  Nothing.  Just the way it's being done in movie theaters.  Oh, I know.  Well, we were promised all that stuff when we signed with that guy. 
[01:12:30]  That's how serious is advertising Howard in movie theaters.  You know something, though?  Good.  I don't care.  Let him spend all this money on all the advertising they want, because the bottom line is, you  just got to come in and do a good show.  Do a good show every day.  A really good show.  Because once all this shit, the bullshit, you know, anticipation, build-up, once all  that dies down, it's just now you got to put on a good show. 
[01:13:00]  Something that motherfucker hasn't done in years.  In years.  It doesn't matter what medium he's on doing it.  Good luck to him.  Let him pump the shit out of him.  I don't care.  Want to put him in movie theaters, and we have a billboard on Jericho Turnpike?  Fine by me.  And, you know, it's not...  I'm not even kidding.  We're on page...  It really is fine.  We're on page 84 of the Daily News today.  That's right.  That's right.  A little ad on page 84.  Us Weekly is a nice hit.  That's a nice hit for us.  Us Weekly is ridiculous how many copies that thing sells every five days, I think. 
[01:13:30]  I think it comes out every five days, Us Weekly.  That's how huge that magazine is right now.  Is there not that much friggin' gossip?  Yeah.  You've got to know if, you know, that Simpson broad, Jessica Simpson, is still with Nick.  I thought that was confirmed already.  Eh, not really.  They're still trying to figure that out.  And what's going on with Brad and Jolie there?  Oh, Angelina Jolie.  They might be engaged, you know?  We've got to figure that out.  Stop it.  Oh, yeah.  And then there's a section, I think it's in that magazine, where they say celebrities are just like us. 
[01:14:00]  And then they show celebrities doing cute things that we all do.  Regular things like taking out the trash.  Taking out the trash and getting gas.  Pumping a little gas that's self-serve.  And then you get to see all the celebrities in their hot dresses.  See who was the hottest dressed of the past week.  Eh, good stuff like that.  You subscribe to that, do you?  No.  Oh, but I'm spending a fortune on the magazines for somebody else.  Holy shit.  See, here it is. 
[01:14:30]  The latest issue of Us Magazine.  Brittany and Kevin, trouble after baby?  Oh.  Fed up, Spears and her six-week-old son leave home for a week after an insensitive Kevin parties?  That doesn't make sense.  After an insensitive Kevin parties.  Oh, I see.  I was thinking that Kevin was having many parties.  Insensitive parties?  Yeah.  Yeah, all right.  But he's, I get it.  Okay.  Yeah.  He's insensitive and he's partying a lot.  I got it.  Okay.  I thought he was going to many parties, which made that confusing. 
[01:15:00]  And then you got like, you know, the red carpet.  Well, there's always the red carpet shots.  And how hot the chicks are on the red carpet.  And how badly dressed some of them are.  They don't like the way some of them are dressed.  And then they, who wore it best?  And they get two, like, female celebrities in similar type dresses.  And then you get to vote who's hotter.  Wow.  That Eva Longoria, or whatever her name is, from Desperate Housewives versus Sandra Bullock.  Who won, you think?  Oh, stop it. 
[01:15:30]  Sandra Bullock is such a frump.  Speed 2 was on yesterday.  That's a good movie.  Oh.  Remember when they're on the boat and you're like, what's going to happen?  All right.  Very funny.  But then in the pullout, we're mentioned.  Oh, there it is.  Big time.  Right in the middle.  Huge XM ad in the middle of the latest issue of Us.  It flips right to when you're trying to thumb through a magazine.  Yeah.  But it says, the stars you want.  Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, Air America with Al Franken. 
[01:16:00]  The Opie and Anthony show.  And it has a picture of old Jimmy Norton.  Little Jimmy's in there.  And then it has Tyra and Ellen.  And then it shows all the music channels and everything else that XM has to offer.  XM definitely has so much more to offer than the stupid little doggy company.  That's a fact.  And then it shows all the cool latest technology.  The Tau, the Pioneer Airwear, and the Delphi, you know, MiFi, which is my thing.  I like that a lot.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:16:30]  So there you go.  All right.  Before we go back to break, Anthony.  Speculating.  A lot of speculating going on.  You want to explain this?  I can take off this sweatshirt.  Well, Opie, you put out some kind of cryptic message last week.  Very cryptic message.  Ooh.  Yes.  About friends becoming enemies, enemies becoming friends in this radio business of ours, taking 
[01:17:00]  a meeting.  Well.  It was very, very mysterious what you were saying.  We should back up a little bit.  The first year here at XM was just all fun and games.  It was all about getting in here and getting the old rust out.  Right.  Shaking the rust.  True.  And trying to figure out what we could do with this satellite radio thing.  Quite frankly, when we came to XM, even though they were the leader, the company had problems.  And then they hired Eric Logan. 
[01:17:30]  And Eric Logan had to sit in that office of his with that wacky haircut and just kind  of take a look around.  Just kind of take a look around and wait.  Right.  He was a big boss just waiting and waiting and waiting and taking it all in and learning  and learning.  Soaking it in.  Right.  Soaking it all in.  And a year later, he is just firing people left and right.  Mm-hmm.  Chopping heads off and making this company even better.  That's what he's doing.  He's like a samurai.  He really is. 
[01:18:00]  Basically, we haven't been down to Washington since, I think, May.  Yeah.  Almost a half a year.  Mm-hmm.  When we go back down there, we're not going to recognize anyone.  No.  It's all new faces.  All new.  All new.  I don't even know how many people.  All eager new faces.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All motivated.  Oh, yeah.  Because we're now taking it to the next level.  Mm-hmm.  Because it was something I said in the beginning.  No offense, because there are some very talented people working in satellite radio.  But in general, most of the people that were doing their jobs with satellite radio were 
[01:18:30]  people that weren't good enough for commercial radio.  Yeah.  Because it didn't have the respect yet.  It really didn't.  So it was people that were available because no one else really wanted to hire them in commercial  radio.  Mm-hmm.  So that's what happened with this company, I believe.  And a lot of it was technology over content.  Right.  When it first started.  Right, right.  There was more emphasis put on getting everything working.  Right.  And hiring people that could do that than it was what was actually going out over the air  when they first started.  Correct.  Which is the same battle that cable television had and other mediums. 
[01:19:00]  So FM radio early on.  Then the transition was made where, all right, look, this does work.  People are subscribing in great numbers.  Now we have to entertain them.  Right.  With content.  Right.  With radio content.  This satellite thing got a lot of respect.  So Eric Logan hung out for a year, taking a look and looking around and learning, and  now he knows what he wants to do.  People are getting fired left and right.  Got to weed out some of those people that were brought on early.  Right.  Now some of them, I think, felt like it was owed to them. 
[01:19:30]  Right.  You know, that just because they were there for so long, they should continue to be there.  But Eric Logan, iron-fisted Logan, didn't care.  Didn't want to hear it.  He rules with an iron fist.  Did you mention who left the company, who I liked a lot and who you guys liked a lot?  Who?  Who resigned?  Oh, Bruce Kelly.  Did we talk about that yesterday?  No.  Yeah.  Well, we were going to do that separately because he was one of the good guys.  Yeah.  Because now people are going to be confused and think he got fired. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, okay.  You know who he was.  Separate circumstances.  Oh, yeah.  No, he left.  And we're doing a whole Bruce Kelly thing in memory of Bruce Kelly.  Oh, okay, okay.  And we're going to get him on the air.  It was going to be our huge break in the 9 o'clock hour, but that's okay, Jimmy.  No, we'll do it, but you could have just said to me, I'm trying to talk to you.  Dude, don't.  We'll get to the doodish.  I'm trying to talk to you.  I can't look at that.  Look at what?  I just want to say.  Stop. 
[01:20:30]  All you had to say was, Jim, like, oh, we'll get to that in a little bit.  I would have went, oh, okay.  Only you could figure out how to, like, take a dump in the shape of a cock and ball.  It's a pretzel made of moose.  What?  I don't know who these are.  These were sent to Steve.  I'm not talking about that.  Mitch me.  We know.  Anyway.  So then Logan is, yeah, Logan is firing and bringing in more qualified people.  Yes.  Yes.  The company is just getting that much stronger every single day now, Anthony.  Yep.  Every single day, and it's even affecting us. 
[01:21:00]  We realize that we probably need to bring on some people that we could look toward to  help bring our show to the next level, right?  Yeah.  And so I said something, yes, I said in radio, your friends become your enemies and your  enemies become your friends.  It's a fact.  It happens all the time.  Yeah.  And this is how I'm justifying taking a high-powered meeting in the very near future  with someone that will definitely, definitely help the company. 
[01:21:30]  I will give him that much credit.  Mm-hmm.  He will help the company a lot.  And then he wants to kind of take a peek at us.  That's a huge hint, by the way.  A huge hint.  And then he wants to take a peek at us.  Peek is fine, but I don't fucking answer to anybody.  I already said to Logan, we will not answer to this person.  No.  I answer to two people.  E-Lo and Hugh Pinero.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's it. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, oh.  That's it.  When was the last time you talked to Hugh?  Yeah.  I'm going to hide everyone's back, chatting with Hugh.  Occasionally, there might be a phone conversation or an email.  He's probably trying to get a show on Fox or something like that.  He's been chatting it up with Hugh.  Chatting it up?  You want your own show somewhere.  You want your own talk show.  Chatting it up.  You know, I want my own channel.  Yeah, dead weight's out in L.A. and Hope's not feeling well again, but, you know, I'm  available to do my own show.  What are you doing, Ed? 
[01:22:30]  I said answer to, not call up.  All right.  And I'm not getting the phone calls.  I just, those, I consider those people my superiors at XM.  Anyone else can absolutely go fuck themselves.  There you go.  Well, I told Elo we would not answer this, the answer to this person whatsoever.  Whatsoever.  He would never, ever fill some kind of boss role.  No fucking way.  Yeah.  No way.  Right.  And we'll really get into this when this person is revealed. 
[01:23:00]  Trust me.  The big reveal.  The big reveal, yes.  So, a lot of people trying to figure out this whole mess that I started a couple days ago.  And this thing came in from Tom.  And I, now I'm hearing that other people are working on their own little things.  Things.  They're taking the audio and stuff and trying to fit, and they're trying to figure out  what the hell's going on, okay?  So, this is what Tom thinks, I guess.  Your friends become your enemies, and your enemies become your friends.  A lot of people talking. 
[01:23:30]  Isn't it funny when you read the message board, the speculation thread, and they play, they  grab like a word that was said during a sentence, and just run with it, and it's completely  wrong.  BCN, and that episode is getting over there.  I love meeting them.  And then we hate everyone that was at WAF.  Jeremy.  Tim Sabian, Jim Brewer.  We'll be taking a meeting with an arch enemy in the very near future.  With an arch enemy.  You've got to think they're going to help us eventually. 
[01:24:00]  I believe this meeting will be going down in the very near future.  You're meeting with Mr. Meaghan, Pat Morita?  No joke.  An arch enemy.  We might not have a choice.  Might not have a choice at this time.  That's how I'm justifying this stupid meeting, by the way.  It all makes sense now.  It has to happen.  It has to happen, Anthony.  This enemy now is your friend.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM is excess.  It has to happen, Anthony.  You lose all your friends, and then your enemies become your new friends. 
[01:24:30]  Wow.  I got to chill.  That was nice.  I like how that guy put that together.  Nice.  I like that.  We're going to have to play that again before the end of the show.  Very mysterious.  Very mysterious indeed.  I don't know what's going to happen next.  You see the speculation thread on Wackbag?  It's gotten up to, I don't even know how many pages.  I stopped at page 12, I think.  Oh, no.  It's in the 20s.  Is it really?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  Last night, I put some random word in Google and just pulled the first picture I found out 
[01:25:00]  and just posted that without any words, and it was like people on bumper cars,  and people were speculating what it meant.  I start cracking up.  I'm at home going, I'm just going to throw a picture on here just to fuck with them.  And then they started speculating that the picture of the bumper cars was the fact that  they were all messed up in their speculation and bouncing off of each other more so than 
[01:25:30]  it had to do with what they were speculating about.  Well, I could go one step further.  For the gang at Wackbag.com, there's an enemy among you.  There's an enemy among you.  Oh, no.  What does that mean?  That is fucking up your speculation thread.  Do you have a pseudonym on there, Opie?  There's an enemy among you.  Just when you think you're getting close.  Someone throws you off.  This enemy is throwing you off.  Believe in yourselves.  Believe in yourselves. 
[01:26:00]  All right, Yoda.  But realize this.  There's an enemy among you.  That's funny.  There's an enemy among you.  That's why you can't figure it out for sure.  Are you typing away, throwing them off the hook?  That's all I'll say.  There's one enemy among you.  That's funny.  That has something to do with me.  All right.  What is this turd audio?  I don't know.  Jimmy, I guess we've got to, like, acknowledge your turds.  No, I would never ship my... 
[01:26:30]  Danny was having a contest, and this guy emailed me, and so I forwarded it to Steve.  But the contest is among us.  What do you mean?  Or would it be amongst us?  Amongst.  Amongst us.  See, I'm...  Oh.  Among us.  But, um...  No, there was, like, video, too.  No, there was, like, video of what?  The actual act of creating this?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no, because that would be sick.  That would be hot.  Instead of printing it out in a big 8x10 and holding them up, I swear to you, it looks like... 
[01:27:00]  It looks like mousse.  Like chocolate mousse run through a Play-Doh Fun Factory into a shape.  No, you don't want to hear the audio.  It's only good with the video.  It's just audio.  Audio smells good. 
[01:27:30]  Nothing.  Do you hear it go down eventually?  Sounds like a levee breaking.  It's not like...  It did sound like the levee was struggling.  This is awful.  Is there a video going up on foundrymusic.com?  Is that what you're teeing in? 
[01:28:00]  Oh, I think there will be.  I think there will be.  This audio stinks.  Yes, I'm sure it did.  Is that the flushing or the actual act? 
[01:28:30]  Oh, I think it's the flushing.  Oh, okay.  I think it's the act where it's just now falling out.  I do think, though, that there's one that you should see.  I thought it was a good one.  All right.  We'll throw the videos up for everybody to enjoy over the weekend.  Yeah, it's called Help a Rascal Out.  All right.  Very good.  Very good.  Disgusting.  Hey, we were talking about Tyra in the fat suit. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  And a lot of controversy over this.  Oh, why is that?  Well, she's dressing up as a fat person.  Who did this before?  Everybody that's ever done a talk show.  Bob Kelly?  Yeah, every skinny person that's done a talk show is dressed like the fat person.  Now, I remember someone doing this, and they go out on buses, like public transportation,  a restaurant, things like that, and then they get back on and talk about how this has just  opened their eyes about how difficult it is, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:29:30]  Enough.  Do you know what she did for Halloween?  Tyra?  For some reason, I can't miss the show.  I don't watch it, but as I'm flipping through, it's on.  You know what the problem is?  Because of our weird hours, we got not the greatest choices of TV when we go home.  When we get home, it's all that old housewife shit.  All the great TV starts around nine when we're starting to think about going to bed, right?  And all sleepy.  But we get the housewife shit.  Right.  You know, that's why I finally had to get the DVR so I could, you know, check out all 
[01:30:00]  the cool shit out there.  How many fucking, how many judge shows do we need on television?  How many god-awful judge shows do we need?  And they, you know what the thing is?  They know it's only fun when they're black people that are on the stands.  Yeah.  They know that because how many judge shows, what's the ratio of black to white in this  country?  It sure ain't on the judge show because every single case involves black people and they  cannot speak and it is the funniest goddamn thing. 
[01:30:30]  And you know they're doing it on purpose.  Yana, let me tell you about something.  I got, it took my car, it took my chow, it took my money, and I just sit there laughing  my ass off.  Love those stupid judge shows.  Well, I'm going to defend you because I take a peek at Tyra too.  Yeah.  Because it's on.  Did you see the one on Halloween?  You're a little tired so you're flipping around, you want to see something on TV.  She dressed as a, I didn't see the Halloween one, sorry.  She dressed as Paris Hilton.  They put all kinds of makeup on her.  But she's a, but they put white face on her. 
[01:31:00]  But she's a, no.  But she's a, but she's a, but she's a, but she's a, but she's a, a nice looking woman  that's hosting an awful show.  Of course, yes.  Horrid show.  And they made her up in white face and put white makeup all over her body and she looked  like Paris Hilton.  She looked white.  Like the movie White Chicks.  Right.  Try that with the other way around.  Oh my God.  Forget about it.  But can't there be a rule for Halloween?  If you're a black person, you should dress up as black people. 
[01:31:30]  And if you're a white person, you should dress up as white people.  There should be a rule, but there isn't.  I really think there should be a rule.  Black people could dress as white people.  Because you walk around like a black Superman.  No one's buying it, you silly goose.  Yeah.  That's true.  I mean, I didn't flip over and see, hey, I'm dressed like Sambo today.  I put a little black face on.  Didn't see that.  He's a white guy.  Can you imagine if fucking Danza put on black face that day?  Forget about it.  You'd be done.  Yeah.  But black people are always putting on the white face and going out.  Yep. 
[01:32:00]  Make movies, movie posters.  White chicks.  Yeah.  I'd love to see a movie called Black Chicks.  They'd never make.  Eddie Murphy did a bit a long time ago that was pretty funny.  Yeah, on SNL, where he put on the white guy makeup.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And everywhere he went, there were other black people around on a bus.  And then once the last black person left, a party went on in the bus, and everyone was having a good time and partying.  And then the bus would stop, and more black people would get on, and everyone just kind of sits there like they're on a bus again.  And he was, like, exposing that white people have fun every time there isn't a black person around. 
[01:32:30]  It's really a funny bit.  I remember that, yes.  You want to hear the Tara thing?  Yeah, what is she doing?  Tyra.  Ah, Tyra.  I'm sorry.  Tyra, Tyra, Tyra, Tyra.  Yes.  She has got some forehead on her.  She looks more and more like RuPaul every day.  Yeah.  Especially when she throws on the clown makeup.  Like, she has way too much makeup.  That girl is beautiful, but she throws on too much makeup, and she's starting to look like RuPaul.  Did you see when she had Flock of Seagulls hair the other day? 
[01:33:00]  No.  She actually had it look like the Flock of Seagulls hairdo.  I don't know what they're doing over there, but I'm slightly intrigued.  I like how the guests have to walk the runway at the end of the show.  That is hilarious, because they get the fat chicks on that don't really believe in themselves,  have low self-esteem, and at the end of the show, the fat chicks also have to walk the  runway, and it's just so awkward, and she's trying to make everyone equal and all that.  Well, that's the whole catchphrase of our show, and the whole feel is like, your dreams 
[01:33:30]  can come true.  Anything you want, you can get.  If you look like her.  Yeah, exactly.  Because they got these slobs walking the runway, trying to do the little spin and everything,  and you can dream all you want.  You work it, girl, and then the crowd is cheering, because look, look, you work it, girl.  Look how good you look.  And everyone claps, and they feel good about themselves.  Of course.  Until they get home and open up that freezer and get the Haagen-Dazs out and weep into it.  Salty tears melting that deliciousness. 
[01:34:00]  Until the studio lights go off, and the cameraman starts packing up his camera, and Tyra goes  off in her limo, and you're standing there in the hallway going,  That was fun.  But I thought I was somebody.  Big fatties leaving their seat, grabbing their pocketbooks.  That was fun, wasn't it?  But I thought I was a new friend of Tyra.  Back out into the real world, fatso.  Where's Tyra?  You got to powder your side blubber so it doesn't shape.  That's right.  Powder your side blubber, stupid.  Then walk down that runway.  Where's Tyra?  I thought we'd be hanging out. 
[01:34:30]  She taught me.  Oh, she had a photo shoot.  That I can do whatever I want.  Get out of the way, fatso.  Here's cab money, stupid.  Tyra's had a photo shoot.  You're staying there?  They're done.  They open that giant bay door where the car's going out, and you have to walk out into the  sunlight alone with your tissue-filled purse.  That's right.  Sob into it.  Fatso.  That's right.  Tyra's busy.  She's at a party you couldn't possibly even look into. 
[01:35:00]  She's being pretty, you lonely lard-ass.  So fucking moped down the street by yourself with your comfy shoes and your bad cabs.  That is the reality, man.  Swabbing your runny nose with that tissue you put in your purse.  Exactly.  Hair in a bun.  You got the whole studio audience cheering for you.  You're on a natural high, and then that high just, yeah, you're right, just slowly  dissipates.  We're all the same inside.  We have the same wants and dreams, don't we, people?  Well, and they can come true if you just believe in yourself. 
[01:35:30]  That's right, Tyra.  They can't.  All right.  Open the Bombay door and let Fat Boy out.  Do you really think we all have the same dreams and wants?  No, I don't think Tyra's big want is to make it up that second flight of steps without her  lungs collapsing.  All right.  Let's go to the audio.  Tyra talks about fat suit show that she's going to be doing.  All righty.  We got to get audio of Tyra.  I bet it's all serious, too, right?  Because music can't be a fun thing. 
[01:36:00]  Don't make fun of it.  And we're going to hear that she probably learned a lot.  Of course.  I swear.  All right.  First, let's look at the picture of her that E-Rock just put up on the.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Wow.  It is a lower, like taken from knee level, up at her, total crotch shot.  She's hot.  Yeah.  Thank you, Freddy Krueger sweater.  Wow.  Her haunt?  Yeah.  It really is a creepy shirt.  It's a matter of like 1920s football player quarterback shirt. 
[01:36:30]  What do you want, a chain gang?  Fucking death stinks.  She'd be going to jail in Monopoly with that awful shirt.  Striped shirt, dolt.  He's trying, man.  He's got so many different clothes.  Oh, my God.  Every day.  He really does.  Something different is trying out on us.  It is something a little different.  That's good.  From the Spanky McFarlane collection.  I'm a 1950s prison film. 
[01:37:00]  Really, I'm making us sick.  All right.  Here we go.  Tyra.  Tyra was shocked by what happened as heads turned when she put on a fat suit for an upcoming episode of her talk show.  The suit made it appear that the Slender Banks weighed 350 pounds.  What was it that shocked you the most?  The people that were staring and laughing in my face.  That shocked me the most.  As soon as I entered the store when I went shopping, I immediately heard Snickers.  Immediately.  I just was cold and hurt. 
[01:37:30]  She staged blind dates.  Hidden cameras caught on tape.  Rude reactions from men who had no idea they were sitting across from the famous supermodel.  As you can imagine, I'm a big girl and I have to live this life being a big girl.  Oh, you don't have to imagine?  What do you mean you don't have to imagine?  I can see that.  Yeah, well, that wasn't nice.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  One of them was so outright rude and hurtful.  So say you did like me and you brought me home to your parents. 
[01:38:00]  They'd be like, what's wrong with you?  Why?  What's wrong with you?  Because I'm black?  No.  Because I'm big.  Yes.  You're fat, you idiot.  Listen, Tyra.  Are you going out with fat guys?  Exactly.  Let's, let's, let's.  Oh, wow.  Good point.  Great point.  Stop, Tyra.  Who's she banging?  Do we have a picture of who she's banging?  Are you going out with fat guys, Tyra?  Are you?  Do you know?  Do you know who she's banging?  Believe me, it ain't Martini Steve.  No. 
[01:38:30]  Martini Steve is not fat.  He's a big muscular man.  Big bear.  We got a story on hybrids, by the way.  Oh, yes we do.  None of us are brave enough to actually say it on the air, but we'll see what happens later  on in the show.  Go ahead, Dan.  I just want to say she does address that very question in the next clip.  She does?  Yeah.  Thank you, Than.  Sure.  She dates fat guys?  That she says it's less important for women to date fat men.  Fucking liar.  Oh, what a fucking.  What a.  Such a liar.  It's less important. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  What, for you to fucking practice what you preach, stupid?  Liar.  Liar.  Liar.  Exactly.  Liar, liar, weave on fire.  Maybe they were laughing because they saw it was a fat suit.  Right.  Because they never look convincing.  Eddie Murphy pulled it off to the nutty professor, and you know how many hours he probably had  to sit in a makeup chair, and it still looked like a fat suit.  And it's on film.  And it's good.  And it's not right there across from a table.  I bet you they recognize this is a fat suit.  There's something going on here.  Of course.  Would you, you know, take me home to your, meet your parents and your family? 
[01:39:30]  Of course they'd laugh.  If any one of us brought a big fat woman, 350 pounds, home, and said, you know, hey, come  over, I want you to meet my family, you don't think any of your family is going to go, dude,  what the fuck?  What are you doing?  What is that beast?  This is how predictable this woman, I bet if she says in the next clip, if Fanta, it's  about, it's less important, she's probably going, because women, they judge more in their  looks than men are. 
[01:40:00]  Of course.  All right, let's take a lesson.  Kyra realizes that at the end of her 15-hour stunt, she has the luxury of taking off her  costume and returning to her supermodel figure.  Kyra!  Thank you, sir.  Kyra!  Kyra!  She helps people will learn a lesson.  There's no excuse for rudeness, there's no excuse for ugliness, and there's no excuse for  nastiness.  We're fatness!  And that's what I experienced.  My name is Kyra Banks.  Kyra Banks?  Yeah.  Like the real Kyra Banks?  That's who I am. 
[01:40:30]  Well, it's very nice to meet you, Kyra.  We're doing an experiment.  Right.  So, honestly, what was going through your head?  That you were a largely?  And you would...  Would I go out with you again?  No.  Probably not.  Probably not.  And if the tables were turned, Kyra claims she'd be more accepting of a man with a little  more around the middle.  I think people are way less judgmental about chunky guys.  I have friends that love it.  They're like, ooh, I love a Tyra.  I love a thick man.  I love a big man. 
[01:41:00]  Why don't you love it?  You know?  Yeah.  And women are just...  We are just so much broader in our scheme of what's attractive.  Do you like guys like that?  I like them all, child.  A while ago, I said that, you know, I like a guy.  He doesn't have to be all rich and famous.  He can be normal.  And I remember I was walking in the mall and this guy was like, Tyra, I'm normal.  I live with my mama.  I ain't got a car and I ain't got a job.  I'm real normal.  I'm like, that's not normal.  That's a loser.  Holy shit.  Go away.  What a fucking fraud.  Go away, you Oprah wannabe. 
[01:41:30]  Did you hear it?  And I have friends that like...  Yeah, well, I have black friends.  What does that mean, stupid?  Who do you sleep with?  Whose zipper do you open?  Is he fat?  Not chunky.  I bet he's not chunky.  I bet he's at the gym all the time.  And I'm sure it's not your supermodel friends you're talking about.  Absolutely not.  Those coked out dummies you hang out with in suede.  You never see those supermodels with chunky guys.  Never.  Unless they're multi-millionaire computer guys or filthy rich.  Then you'll see an ugly guy.  Hollywood heroin chic. 
[01:42:00]  That's what they are.  She is so full of it.  Oh, that is really...  And chunky guy is a far cry from a 350 pound broad.  Stop it.  You get a guy that's got the love handles or spare tire or something.  Yeah, a lot of women can see past that and look right into the wallet.  But the other way around, it's a 350 pound woman.  You're not talking about a girl with just a little chub on her.  No.  With a little bit of ass on her or something. 
[01:42:30]  She dressed up like a mess.  Like a big mess.  Yeah, let her dress up like she's a little chunky.  Maybe a little in the ass and hips.  But she still has the same face.  Right.  And tits and everything.  And then go out and go on a blind date.  She'd be bedded down in a second.  There's no excuse for rudeness.  Is that what your idea of getting something done is?  Yes.  There's no excuse for rudeness?  Jesus, what an ass. 
[01:43:00]  What an ass.  How about this?  Oh, what an ass.  How about you teach fat people to take off their blubber the way you take off that fat costume, stupid,  so they're not fucking clogging up lines and sitting next to me sweating  like that fat Israeli girl I sat next to on the way to L.A.  I wanted our plane to hit a mountain.  Dude, I was being aggressive with her.  Her fucking fat was in my thing.  I would actually move my elbow against it until Fatso took it out of my seat.  Oh, Jesus.  Eat all you want.  I don't care if you die with your face and a piece of cake.  I really don't.  I hope you do, actually.  Just stay away from my seat. 
[01:43:30]  Don't interfere.  I'm a sex addict.  Do I jerk off on the plane next to you?  Is that acceptable?  I remember one time back from L.A.  I was under a blanket.  It was late.  Who's looking?  Yeah, who's looking?  You smoked good.  That cologne was nice.  Mike in Jersey.  I put my nose in your old spice neck.  Mike in Jersey.  All right, so listen.  She was on Punk'd with Ashton Kutcher.  She's coming off all.  There's no excuse for rudeness.  There's no excuse for nastiness.  That cunt destroyed them on the show when she got punk'd. 
[01:44:00]  Nantiness or not, she was a fucking nasty, rude cunt on that show.  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  I don't think that language is necessary, sir.  Thank you, sir.  I do.  Good point, fella.  Living here in Allentown.  Ah, I bet you never heard that.  Clang, clang, clang.  Hey, sir, Mike?  Yeah.  How's Allentown?  It's quiet.  Are they closing all the factories down?  There are no factories in Allentown. 
[01:44:30]  What happened?  Yeah, let's get an update on Allentown since that Billy Joel song came out.  What happened to Iron Coke and Chromium Steel?  I wish I could remember the words, but I only remember it goes like that.  Oh, I can't remember anything except for the beat.  Not one fucking lyric.  Oh, by the way, hold on.  Hold that for a second.  Yes, I forgot.  Tyra Banks is dating Chris Webber. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, good way to look past the physical and the financial.  NBA superstar, Chris Webber.  There you go.  Way to look past it, Tyra.  Thank you, Nick.  Thank you, Brian, for helping us out with that on the phone lines.  Not only is he an athlete and built like an athlete, he's a fucking millionaire.  Way to look for a regular guy.  Regular guy.  Chris Webber.  You've got to say, like, multi-millionaire.  Of course he is.  He's an NBA star.  He's got uber millions.  Uber, uber, uber millions.  All right, why don't we play a little Allentown?  Allentown, yeah, because what's going on? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, we need an Allentown.  Hey, sir, Mike?  Yes?  Did your fathers fight in the Second World War?  Did you spend your weekends on the Jersey Shore?  Did they meet your mothers in the USO?  Ask them to dance?  Dance with them slow?  You do not know the words, Allentown.  They're all coming back to me.  They're sweating back in my head.  Hey, are you living there in Allentown?  Yes, Jimmy.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[01:46:00]  Hey, hey, hey.  I remember that.  I lived in Honeypin, Opie.  It was part of the law.  You had to know some of the words today.  We're here in Allentown.  And they're closing all the factory's doors.  That's my slapping.  Standing.  Standing.  Were you standing in line?  Standing.  There's high unemployment in Allentown.  Right. 
[01:46:30]  I got it.  Yep.  Still?  Jesus, Anthony.  They rubbed their cocks on our mothers in Allentown.  All right, enough, enough, enough.  No.  The restlessness was handed down.  We're living here in Allentown.  Due to nuclear things, our babies have a syndrome that's down.  All right.  I had to really stretch for that one, but we got it out, thank God. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, you stretched out the syllables nicely.  Jesus.  Mike.  Yeah.  So what do you got for the show?  Hey, I haven't been listening for a while.  Dance with them for a while.  Huh?  So I've been listening to terrestrial radio for, unfortunately.  Why?  What happened?  I had an accident with my truck, and I left it in my truck.  Well, I had an accident with my truck.  I was driving there.  I'll be getting back next week.  All right, you're going to be back.  All right, let's go.  Um, what I've been doing is I was listening to the Jersey Guys yesterday. 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  And I'm just, like, driving along, and all of a sudden I hear Steve from Yellowstone calls.  And?  And it certainly sounded like Jimmy that was calling him.  I wonder.  Gee, I happened to listen to the Jersey Guys yesterday.  I was on the Jersey Turnpike, and that fucking Cousin Brucie echo was making me want to hit a divider.  And, uh, hey, I didn't hear it, actually.  Actually, I had my radio turned down.  Not that I was making a call or anything.  But, um, did anything get through? 
[01:48:00]  Uh, yeah.  They left you on up to the point where you were about to say, Ramon.  Well, I didn't do it, of course.  But, apparently, there was a caller.  Misby, yes.  Uh, there was a caller who, Steve from Yellowstone called because they were talking about guys that died on the toilet.  Uh, or some guy, the Home Depot story.  And they had done two breaks on it.  And there was nothing that even made me want to, like, smile a little.  So I felt Steve ought to give a call.  And I think he said something along the lines of, uh, and I won't, Ramon, uh, bring me two guys who don't rip off Opie and Anthony. 
[01:48:30]  Ramon, the Jersey Guys suck.  Those guys are frauds.  You know that, right, Mike?  Absolute frauds.  One of the guys worked with us at NAW, saw the success Anthony and I were having.  And then, I swear to God, we don't play this game often, but they're a bunch of fucking frauds.  Tell them, Iraq.  A bunch of frauds.  Completely changed their act after, uh, working with us.  I just didn't laugh.  I didn't, I didn't laugh at it.  I was listening to it. 
[01:49:00]  And what is with the Echo?  What, why would anyone talk into that fucking Echo?  It's awful.  It's the whole station.  Yeah, it gives, it's some room.  What is the, what is the point of that?  Can anybody tell me, like, what, you, you know, radio.  What, what, like, what do they think?  They're like, all right, here's what the Echo does.  You know, I don't, I don't have a.  It's so old school.  Yeah, I don't have a take on the Echo thing, really.  Maybe we can get an old school engineer on it or something.  Oh, oh, oh.  Drew Boogie, Drew.  Hello, morning.  I heard, uh, from an old enemy that the Echo makes, when you turn the dial to the station, 
[01:49:30]  it makes the station sound different.  That's it.  I think it's used to just make it sound bigger than life.  When you start, uh, using, uh, tricks like that, you just, you're hiding the fact that  you don't really have content for your radio show.  Yeah, that's what that's all about.  But I mean, like, what do you mean it sounds different?  Like, if it's talk video.  Stop showing people pictures of your dogs.  They're not mine.  I don't know who they are.  Why, why would, um.  Throw those up on the wall, by the way.  Why would you.  With the works of art.  With the hot chicks. 
[01:50:00]  You're disgusting.  Why would you want to.  No, that's, that's, if you need an answer from me, that's exactly what it is.  It's, it's, it's one of those things to kind of, you know, hide the fact that your content  stinks.  I agree.  And making it sound bigger than it really is.  Dude, it's terrible.  They're awful.  Cousin Bruce, he was bad enough, but at least he was Cousin Bruce.  You're like, all right, well, the guy's a legend.  He's been doing it for a long time.  Well, no.  I mean, most of the, uh, Echo, uh, stations are like oldies and stuff.  Right, yeah.  Where they're not really getting anything done anyway, you know, they're just singing  songs and make it, and it makes it sound that much better because it sounds like you're 
[01:50:30]  doing it from the middle of a fucking gymnasium, you know, but when you have a talk show with  an Echo, you're just hiding the fact that you have nothing very, very clever or interesting  to, to do on your show.  It was, dude, that Echo was driving me, I don't mind the lack of laughs, you know, hey,  the guy's sitting on the toilet.  Yeah.  All right.  He is.  You guys, uh, big star on the phone.  Yes.  Uh-oh.  I watch The Apprentice every fucking week.  Donald Trump?  No, it's not Donald Trump, unfortunately.  It's Marcus. 
[01:51:00]  Hi, Marcus.  Marcus got kicked off The Apprentice last night, and, uh, Marcus, you were the one everyone  hated on the show, and I gotta tell you, my friend, I liked you a lot.  You know something?  I really appreciate that.  Really, the show is a bunch of crap.  From the get-go, Trump made a characterization of me, and, uh, the editors down at Mark Burnett  ran with it, and I was their, uh, their kick toy, you know?  You're trying to tell me that reality, uh, TV's not that real?  I can't tell you, it's a complete bag of terrible lives, man. 
[01:51:30]  Wow.  Yeah, we hear that all the time, that, uh, you know, they edit, uh, things in a way to  make the, the, the people on the shows look bad.  Yeah.  Marcus got under everyone's skin.  Everyone hated him, and that's why I loved Marcus a lot.  I thought you were great for the show.  Let me tell you something.  Last night, when, when Trump said that I was fired, I put my hand on it, I said, on to  bigger, better things, and they weren't even man enough to, to include that in the show.  It's just, they'd chop it up, and they, they took whatever they could to try to, uh, to  twist me around, and we're just focusing on footmate.com right now, and that's moving forward, 
[01:52:00]  so.  On what?  Footmate.com.  What is that?  Footmate?  Footmate, yeah.  It's a, it's a, it's a product I invented a while back.  It's a shower foot massage, and we're, uh, actually redesigning it, and reintroducing  it to key markets.  You're, uh, a regular little inventor there, are you?  I am.  I got lots of things, lots of tricks in the bag.  Let me ask you a question.  Do you have anything patented, sir?  Excuse me?  Do you have anything patented?  Yeah, that actually is patented.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  Anything else?  Uh, patented, no. 
[01:52:30]  Ever hear of the light bulb?  What, he has a little invention?  Yeah.  Uh, well, did you, go ahead, Jim.  I, uh, I don't watch The Apprentice.  A friend of mine does.  Oh, it's too bad, because it's a, it's a terrific show.  Well, I, do you, do you, were you a fan, like, a lot, do you feel like...  Yes.  Like, do you think, like, in markets, in season one, or like, whatever, like this season  is, a lot of people say that the whole hype of the show has kind of changed, uh, a certain  amount of, like, you know, what would originally have made it, like, you know?  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  I made it, I'm not sure what you mean made it, but I agree.  I think that, you know, I was a huge fan of the show, still am, and I think that, you  know, in my case, um, what, what I lived through was, was Trump starting a, uh, you know, an  idea about the fact that I couldn't stop talking, which is interesting coming from a guy like  him.  Right.  Um, but, you know, and, and Burnett carried it forward, so I was, you know, it was sad  to see that they couldn't focus on a lot of the great subplots that were actually there.  Yeah, well, last night on the show, I guess you guys had to do a learning annex thing. 
[01:53:30]  It's something that happens here in New York.  It's the, it's this, uh, what, how do you explain the learning annex, Anthony?  You go and, uh, take classes.  Yeah.  On ridiculous things is what it comes down to.  Never anything useful when I look through the learning annex guide.  Learning annex.  And, uh, so they had the two teams and, and, uh, you had to come up with a lesson, I guess,  for everybody.  And Marcus, pretty much, you just sat out.  Why?  You just didn't know.  It's funny.  They didn't, what they didn't show.  First off, the, the subject we had was, it was a complete train wreck.  I was not comfortable with it at all. 
[01:54:00]  It was sex in the workplace.  That was their, uh, lesson they wanted to teach everyone, right?  Sex in the workplace.  Yeah, how do you teach somebody sex in the workplace?  You know, if you get together with a co-worker and you open your mouth, you've got a problem.  Right.  You keep it on the down low, you don't got a problem.  So Marcus is like, fuck this, this is stupid.  So you pretty much didn't feel like, uh, really participating, right?  Well, you know, let me, let me hop in there.  What I did was to try to save the deal, which I think I really did, was I got out there with  the participants before the class started to, to warm them up and to, to get to know them  because we were dependent on their vote, uh, of confidence. 
[01:54:30]  And during the class, they did not show it.  Uh, I was in the class getting people involved, getting the people laughing, having a good time  and getting involved.  Ah, cut out.  They're not going to, they're not going to show that because they want to characterize  you as a, as a fool.  Well, what we saw on TV was a, um, a Jewish kid who, who seems to be a virgin, who seems  very uncomfortable talking about sex.  He was the project manager.  He was in charge of this whole thing, Anthony, getting the whole lesson together.  Mm-hmm.  And then you had a, um, a gay guy.  I forget the, I forget the gay guy's name. 
[01:55:00]  So now.  His name was Clay.  Yeah.  So now they're talking in front of this, uh, this room full of people that are very conservative  in general.  And you got the Jewish kid that is so not believable because he doesn't know shit about  sex, talking about sex in the workplace.  And then you got the gay guy takes the mic and starts talking about how, uh, uh, how hot  it is to see a fellow guy in the workplace that has a nice ass or something like that.  You know, listen.  What was it, Marcus?  Everyone was horrified.  Like, ugh. 
[01:55:30]  They're all making the butthead faces in the audience.  When, uh, when Clay said to, to Adam, something about him being a tight ass Jew, I almost fell  off my chair.  Wow.  And, you know, the, it's like, you know, you're, you're depending upon a hundred New Yorkers  to give you a vote of their confidence.  I don't think you want to bring that up.  And frankly, I think that based upon that alone, Clay should have been fired if he was working  for my company.  You know, but you just can't make those comments.  Clay's the gay guy, right?  Yeah.  What did he say, though?  Because that was just, that made for great TV when he started talking about his, uh, his 
[01:56:00]  gayness in the workplace and, and seeing a guy with a hot ass.  What I got from it was that, was that Clay claims that I think he was, uh, sexually harassed  at some point in the workplace.  Oh, okay.  So, and he was recounting those experiences.  Oh, it was, it was just horrific, Anthony.  It's like, hey, you want, like, like, uh, Mr. Trump said last night on the show when, uh,  it was finally revealed that this guy's gay in the boardroom.  He's like, ah, that's why they have menus at restaurants, something for everybody. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, really?  Some people like steak, other people like pasta.  Some people like hot dogs.  There was a lot you didn't see last night.  There was, you know, Trump really roasted all about being a stripper, and they went back  and forth for quite a while.  So, there were a lot of things that were in the boardroom or the cutting floor that were  just priceless.  Yeah, well, the problem with, uh, reality shows is, you know, when you, you, uh, you  know, get rid of someone like Marcus, the show isn't as good.  Yeah.  I don't think Marcus was going to win the whole damn thing, but he made the show worth watching  because, uh, because he was kind of a, uh, like a, like a jerk. 
[01:57:00]  Well, you know, listen to me.  Or you were portrayed as a jerk on the show.  But, you know, listen, that's how they edit it.  But, you know, I'll tell you what, right now, I challenge Trump to a, to a one-on-one  in any, in any arena, any day, any time, and we see who can talk straight.  Uh, you know, they try to, you know, band me up as some fool.  I'm, you know, anytime they're ready.  Marcus, Trump doesn't even remember your name at this point.  Let's be honest.  That's okay.  Maybe he will going forward.  We'll see.  Let's be honest.  I mean, you, you did have balls when you got fired that you, uh, you, uh, you, uh, what's 
[01:57:30]  the word on my, uh, you challenged him on some of the things he said.  I told him it was a complete railroad.  Yeah, why don't we go to that audio really fast?  I know you only have a couple of minutes here, but, uh, here's Marcus getting fired last  night on The Apprentice.  The problems we've got with Marcus, with so many words, with so much talk, with so much  nonsense, with not getting to the point, are the big reasons in my own mind to say, you  just can't work for me.  So, therefore, Marcus, you're fired.  Oh. 
[01:58:00]  Oh.  Right with the catchphrase.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Appreciate it.  Thank you very much, Mr. Trump.  Go.  Good luck, Marcus.  If you mean it, I don't think you do.  I don't think he does.  It's been, it's been a railroad from the beginning, so.  A railroad?  Yeah, it has.  People saw it as.  But, Marcus, you talk too long, too much, and you say the wrong things.  Uh, I disagree, and I don't think you've had enough experience with me to see it.  Marcus, what does it matter?  It doesn't matter at this point.  Just go. 
[01:58:30]  Fair enough.  And good luck.  I certainly will.  And I happen to think you're a nice guy.  I appreciate the sentiment.  Thank you.  George, thank you.  Carolyn, it's been a pleasure.  There you go.  Yeah, because, uh, Trump goes, good luck, and Marcus, I respect you for that.  He doesn't mean it.  He's just saying it for TV.  He doesn't give a fuck about you or your career.  Yeah, but he gets to sit there.  I sat there, I sat in that boardroom trying to make statements, and he would cut me off  every time I talked.  Other candidates in the boardroom, they talk, and they talk, and they talk, and they talk.  It's okay.  Yeah.  They turned me into a caricature, and, you know, I couldn't win. 
[01:59:00]  So you're right.  I wasn't going to win it.  You know, and a little tip to Mr. Trump, if he continues with his Apprentice show after  this season, how about you give us more than 10 minutes of, uh, of, uh, airtime there?  Like, he's only on, on camera 10, 10 minutes a show.  Very busy, gentlemen.  10 minutes a show.  He's on in the beginning, then he gets a quick little update, uh, from his office,  and then at the end, he fires someone.  Very busy, man.  How about you give us a little more time on camera there?  We want to see your face a little more.  That would be great. 
[01:59:30]  Well, Marcus, I enjoyed watching you on the Apprentice.  I got to tell you.  Hey, I really appreciate it.  And, uh, we look forward to seeing you guys with some, with some great new projects we're  doing, we're working on, and, uh, we'll go from there.  All right, uh, so we're promoting, what's, what's the website again?  It's footmate.com.  Footmate?  It's just, it's, it's footmate, F-O-T-M-A-T-E dot com.  Footmate dot com.  Okay.  Thank you, Marcus.  Okay.  Thanks, gentlemen.  All right.  There he goes, Marcus from the Apprentice.  I just get so sick of the catchphrase.  You're fired.  You're fired. 
[02:00:00]  Right.  Yeah, we know.  Trump is kind of calling it in.  He's barely on camera.  That's fine.  Who wants to look at him?  Yeah, but if it's, if it's your show, you know, either commit or don't commit.  Yeah.  He's just like, well, I'll do the show, but I only, uh, I can only be on camera maybe  ten minutes a show.  What's he supposed to do, though?  Yeah.  Hang out with these people?  Yeah.  He's a fucking multi-millionaire developer.  Well, he's a billionaire.  I understand that.  Billionaire?  He's a billionaire.  Yeah, he's a billionaire, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Many times over.  Really?  Because I was just hearing reports that perhaps he's, uh, inflating his, uh, worth. 
[02:00:30]  He's had a big comeback.  And it's closer to half a billion than it is, uh, a billion.  I would go with, uh, a billion and a half.  Billion and a half?  Owns casinos and stuff like that.  That's the casino business.  All right.  We got Voss and Bonnie waiting to join the program.  Yes.  What else are we going to do today?  Oh, yes.  When we get back, do we have this, do we have to do the song live on the show or are you  guys trying to do it yourselves? 
[02:01:00]  Either or.  Either or?  Oh, I thought you guys were trying to mix it nice in the studio.  No, you wanted it.  Could someone get, uh, attempt that or no?  Yes, sir.  All right, we can attempt that.  One of our friends here at XM is leaving the company, Bruce Kelly, for personal reasons.  And, uh, we'll talk about that next and other things, okay?  Including, uh, uh, this.  This over here.  What, Opie?  And then maybe this.  What are you pointing at?  This and this.  What is that?  Well, maybe this.  This is pretty hot, too. 
[02:01:30]  You like that one?  Yeah.  Okay.  And then, of course, this.  Yeah.  I like that one.  Yes, you do.  Internet Predators, you love this stuff.  Oh.  Yes, rosebud frozen peas.  Full of country goodness and green penis.  Wait, that's terrible.  I quit.  Hey, it's time for, uh, more fad talk.  Okay, sure.  Yeah, that's a lot of fun.  Why don't you come to my place?  I'll show you my beefy baloney.  Yeah! 
[02:02:00]  Awesome.  Poor demented honky.  What a day.  I need that, man.  But, Jack.  I'm being hammered.  Bench over, head down, head down, head down.  Bench over, head down.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Is this a faggy show?  Nah, I'm just a flaming faggy.  Is this a faggy show?  I would choke the chicken in front of everybody.  Give me the faggy, faggy.  Give me the faggy. 
[02:02:30]  I'm horny.  Hey, stick it in and start the faggy.  This is tearing the ass out of me.  Shut the hell up.  He's a flaming fag.  I'll give you oral.  Put it in the mouth.  I always wanted those pipes.  Put it in the mouth.  You've got some funky-tasting spots.  Fuck me.  Hell up.  Hell up.  Get your bong out. 
[02:03:00]  I, I, I, you sit.  Get your bong out.  Yeah, you sure am.  You're just not in touch with your sensitive side, Anthony.  Hey!  You're a pout monkey-ass, Opie.  Old hags gave Opie a bonus.  Hey, what's up there, fruitcake?  What is your major malfunction, I'm not here?  I just crapped myself.  Lady chicken man at home.  Lady chicken man at home.  Bag.  This is very funny.  Jesus Christ, this is despicable. 
[02:03:30]  Harry sack with ya.  I like doing oral on my dog.  I just want an erection so I can give it to my mom.  Boom.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Man.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't nap when I go home.  I did that yesterday. 
[02:04:00]  Actually, I forced.  It wasn't even a nap.  It was like I just crashed.  I was playing Age of Empires 3.  New game that's out.  Very good.  I was always into those kind of build.  You build a civilization.  You build a city, armies, and then you're online playing against other people that are  doing the same thing.  And at some point, you have to decide to maybe stop working on your economy as much and build  an army and attack the other guy that's trying to do the same thing on the other side of  the world.  So I'm playing and I notice I'm getting a little sleepy and I have an empire built, man. 
[02:04:30]  I mean, I got some shit.  I got armies positioned.  You're ready to go, right?  I'm ready to rock.  The next thing I remember is waking up and my screen is an empty lot in the woods.  I was asleep as he just bombarded, just walked in.  My army probably just stood there while he just raped the women and destroyed the buildings  and just completely screwed my game up. 
[02:05:00]  But then I slept and I wasn't able to get to sleep last night, so I didn't get to sleep  until after midnight.  Yeah.  Puts you in that vicious cycle.  Not a good game to fall asleep to.  How's your cold eggs?  Well, they're good.  It's great to eat eggs three hours later.  It's like eating fake vomit on a roll.  Oh, no.  What are you going to do?  I want to give a quick update.  No!  But it'll be just a quick one.  You startled me.  This woman, when Voss and Bonnie got married, I was in L.A. and I had a problem with this 
[02:05:30]  woman, so people have been asking for an update.  Wait, what's the problem again?  The woman who, when I went out to L.A., I rented an apartment from this woman.  Oh, we remember her.  Oh, cockroaches and all, right?  Cockroaches, yeah.  Cockroach Plaza.  Yeah, and I put $1,800.  You don't like it because the word cock is in there.  Why, Rich?  I thought it was a good start.  It was.  That's a good start.  That's a single.  You gotta run it out, though.  You know that, right?  You gotta run out that single. 
[02:06:00]  So I wanted my money back.  You know, I left the place in 12 hours.  12 hours you were there?  That's it?  That night I saw roaches.  I was out that night.  I gave her the keys the next day, and I have a sign set that says I turn to her back possession  and listen to you.  Now, what did you pay up front?  You don't have to go into amounts, but was it like a month?  Give me the amount.  It was a total of like, it was gonna be like $1,800 a month fully furnished, which is expensive,  but I mean, it's like for West Hollywood, that's what you gotta pay for furnishings and  all that stuff in a garage, and it was convenient, whatever. 
[02:06:30]  In a garage?  No, no, there's a garage.  It's a parking space.  So, um, it wasn't in a garage.  Well, it could have been on top of the garage, you know, a parking lot.  Like Fonzie?  Yes.  So, Mrs. Cunningham.  Double.  Bonnie gets a double, and Rich looked at the third strike there.  Jesus.  So, I, uh, I go in there and I find a roaches, and there's actually, I think Steve is putting  up some photos, and I have a little video of the roaches on, uh... 
[02:07:00]  Oh, you taped it.  Yeah, I certainly did, because I knew what she was gonna do.  So, I have the $1,800 that I gave her, she gave me back $200 and something dollars, and  then charged me an administrative fee and a canceled check fee, because I canceled my next  month's check, when I realized that she had fucking rented me a roach-infested apartment.  Did you have to put security or anything?  Yeah.  I lost $1,600.  So, the total that you had to do was a month's security, and a month's rent up front?  Well, the month's rent, I actually canceled the check before it went through, because,  uh, that was, uh, she would have taken that, too.  I see. 
[02:07:30]  Um, so she took $1,600 out of the $1,800?  And I had, and I spent $2,300 in hotels over the next two weeks, because I was shooting  for Louis, and I couldn't find a place to live.  I didn't want to live.  What did she justify the $1,600 as?  She won't talk to me on the phone.  Every time I talk to her, oh, look, the Jewish holiday's coming up, oh, and I called her  yesterday, she's like, well, two weeks ago, I was like, well, the accountant comes in  Friday, we just show the places.  Accountant?  This is what she said to me, the accountant, we just show the places, and then a week later,  I'm like, well, you own it, her and her husband, Shalom. 
[02:08:00]  I don't know if they're Jewish, they're Jewish or Irish.  Her and her husband, uh, Irish, Shalom.  Shalom.  She's like, oh, I'm like, you own the place, why do you need the accountant?  And she's like, well, call me tomorrow.  I'm essential to the cockroach effort.  She kept blowing me off, and then it was like the Jewish holiday, and she's like,  oh, the sundown is coming soon, and she blew me off.  I called her again yesterday, and she's like, oh, just email my husband.  I'm like, look, I'm not emailing him.  I invited her to come on the air and discuss this. 
[02:08:30]  Uh, the name of the company is, uh, LA Furnished Apartments, I believe it is, or LA Apartments,  in Los Angeles, so maybe somebody has dealt with these people and has had a similar experience,  or you know something about them, because I'm very frustrated.  I feel like I've been ripped off.  I don't know what justification she could have, and she obviously will not come on the air.  Call her with a German accent.  Scare her.  Rape her.  Here's Jimmy on the phone.  Here's Jimmy on the phone.  Go ahead, go on, leave.  Leave.  I just feel, I just feel like I've been ripped off, and I'm furious.  Well, because, you know, a lot of these people, they're not, they know you don't have time 
[02:09:00]  to go to small claims for it, and they're just going to say, look, I'm keeping the money.  What justification did she give for $1,600?  She, her justification is probably going to be, well, I held the apartment for three weeks,  but it's like, you gave me a fucking roach-infested apartment, stupid.  Right.  That, that, null and void.  Yes.  Fuck you, you held it.  I stayed in a hotel.  I had to eat $2,300.  Okay, it sucks.  I'll deal with it.  But I don't want to eat that $1,600, too.  Can I please play devil's advocate?  Okay.  Did you look at the apartment? 
[02:09:30]  My management did, and during the day, I saw the pictures.  Yeah.  During the day when I first went in, no roaches.  You wouldn't see them during the day.  The apartment itself was okay.  I have photos of it.  Up in the foundry.  At night.  Dude, when I walked in, this is how I knew there was a problem.  I opened my front door, there's a roach on the inside, on the middle of the front door.  That's not subtle.  They're all over the fucking, the little dining room area.  I opened a kitchen cabinet.  There's a big one.  It actually gave me the finger and fucking ran away. 
[02:10:00]  And then I'm like, I'll stay the night.  I'm freaking out.  I'm calling my manager.  It's 2 o'clock in the morning.  I'm like, I'll stay the night.  I saw two in the bedroom.  When you, when your lights are on in the bedroom, and you have cockroaches with the lights on  in the bedroom, you're fucking infested.  And I had answered this.  What girl did you have with you?  What's that?  Yeah.  Perhaps it was your company.  Maybe she brought them.  I'm sorry, Dad.  You're in my suitcase.  And the day before, she's like, yeah, well, the exterminator just came.  I'm like, wait a minute.  It was just before I went to the apartment.  I'm like, you don't have roaches, do you?  You better not have it. 
[02:10:30]  She's like, oh, no, no, no.  It's just.  So the exterminator just came.  How the fuck did you still have roaches, you liar?  There is no way.  Do you have any.  What did you sign?  Whatever the lease was, I signed.  Now, did the lease say anything about $1,600 if you forfeit the apartment?  I don't think so, no.  I mean, who knows?  It might have.  Who knows?  I don't know legally.  You didn't read your fucking lease?  Dude, I flew out to L.A.  I don't care.  You didn't read your lease.  Who needs a whole lease?  They're like more than one page.  No, it was a standard few-month rental thing. 
[02:11:00]  Standard.  Now he knows.  Now it's standard.  I was dumb.  He's never read a lease in his life.  Never.  He knows it's a standard lease.  She has got you by your fucking balls back.  I don't know about that.  I bet she does.  And she never offered me another apartment.  She never.  L.A. furnished apartments.  Maybe you've dealt with these people.  Check Craigslist in Los Angeles.  That's where I found her, which is always the sign of a great fucking apartment renter.  Craigslist.  Get your whores there.  You don't get your apartment there.  Craig knows a lot of people.  He certainly does.  Thank God he has a list. 
[02:11:30]  He is hooked up.  Wow.  I have a great Roach story.  One time I take this girl to a hotel, right, and I have like two pumps.  You're what?  We're like two pumps and I'm done.  Wait, your wife wants to know you were what?  And we were.  I'm banging her.  Bonnie, he was banging her.  Two pumps and I'm done.  And I didn't know what to do when I saw a Roach on a wall.  I go, we've got to get out of here.  I can't stay in a hotel like this.  Because I knew I wasn't going to be able to do it again.  You used the Roach as an excuse to leave after quick sex, you despicable human. 
[02:12:00]  Why'd you come so bad?  I saw the Roach and I panicked.  I was thinking of the disgusted look on Bonnie's face.  Well, because, you know, this is the thing with guys and their egos.  I'm sorry to group you all together.  But she probably wanted to leave.  I mean.  She had the Roach in her purse.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Hoping it would disgust you, Rich.  It's not like it sounds like she was having a great time either, Mr. Two Pumps in your gut.  Yeah, you were doing both of you a favor.  Yeah, she wanted to snuggle with Two Pumps.  Yeah.  Thanks for not making me cum and smoking 80 cigarettes.  Yeah.  I'm going to die from lung cancer. 
[02:12:30]  No pleasure.  Well, we got Rich Voss and Bonnie in studio.  You guys are playing bananas, right?  In Hasbrox?  Yeah, in Hasbrox this weekend.  But let me tell you, we did a Cringe Humor show last night.  Norton was on fire.  It was all the O&A fans were there.  They were great.  Yeah, it was very good.  It was a good show.  CringeHumor.net.  Yeah.  Well, they were there.  Post Wars, Wackbag, all of them.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, Cringe Humor threw the show.  I thought they threw the show.  They should get a little credit today, yes.  I'm telling you, it's so funny watching an O&A audience because you feel like you're 
[02:13:00]  at a Star Trek convention or something like that.  Star Trek.  Do you know that they were trekking through space?  It was a trek.  Star Trek.  I always thought there was a track.  Though the ship always looked like it was on a track.  Yeah.  And people tend to call it Star Trek.  I haven't heard that, though, since, I swear to you, like third grade, when someone would  say, did you see Star Trek?  Yeah.  In third grade, up in the tree house with that guy?  Is that the last time you heard it? 
[02:13:30]  No, that wasn't third grade.  That was, uh...  That was like, um...  Freshman year of college.  Yeah, yesterday.  No, but it was definitely younger than the time you, uh, jerked off with your friend in  bed.  And tried to pass it off as normal.  All guys do this.  Why did you do that?  The worst time was when we saw this roach on the wall and we had to stop.  Last night, uh...  He swatted it.  Rich told a story about him and Norton.  Oh.  What story?  Having sex with the same girl.  Was it the one with the cat box? 
[02:14:00]  No.  The coughing in the bathroom?  You were...  This is the story.  Rich was fingering this girl on the street and Norton was eating her ass.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  It was on 54th and Broadway.  But you know what?  I know it's not true.  Yeah, no.  It's just a joke.  Because he doesn't finger.  Oh, no.  He can't.  He was trying to finger me out.  I was like, that's all you got?  Oh, wow.  When he wears fingerless gloves, they don't show through. 
[02:14:30]  I just noticed that when he was snorkeling when we were in Hawaii.  I was like, look at those...  I can see this in the water.  I would start laughing every time.  They don't bend.  This is why...  Voices' hands don't bend.  They're like little turtle feet.  He's only got one knuckle.  I was going to say, he's missing a knuckle.  Were there ten little fish that thought they were worms?  Yeah.  Trying to eat nibble on them?  Yeah.  It's almost a shark if she's fucking bleeding in the water.  I told you that.  Oh, that's she. 
[02:15:00]  My brother is very pissed off at you and he should call the program.  Why?  Sharks don't like human blood.  Are you crazy?  They don't like human blood.  First of all, menstruation is really not that much blood.  I'm sick of the shark deer crap.  Wait, stars don't like human blood.  They don't like human blood.  They mostly go after surfers because they look like seals when they're looking from down below.  And also, these surfers, they're surfing in breeding waters.  What, does your brother work for Animal Planet?  Why would he be pissed? 
[02:15:30]  See, I've heard that that was like a rumor.  Why?  Why are you passing out the pictures of your dumps?  We're getting into some good discussions here today, Jimmy.  And you're wrecking the flow again.  I had a lot of info on shark attacks, and you had to pass out the dump pictures again.  What's that from?  That's Jimmy's dog.  No, it's not.  He blew up the pictures.  He's been handing them out all morning.  Can I just say that's a very healthy poo? 
[02:16:00]  He just placed it in front of Rich.  Oh.  Rich.  Sharks tend to breed where the waves crash for the surfers.  And many times the surfers are warned, look, you shouldn't be surfing in this area.  It's breeding season.  The sharks are effing all over the place.  So they're going to be a little more aggressive.  But the surfers being, you know, surfers are like, but the waves are too cool.  And they surf anyway.  Yeah, but a shark shouldn't go blood. 
[02:16:30]  See, I've heard that it's actually like a rumor that they mistake you for a...  I know the shark thing is dumb.  No, it's not fun.  It's a setup for your stupid picture.  No, no.  I actually heard that they don't really...  That they don't actually mistake it for a seal.  Like, they can always tell the difference between, like, a seal and a human being.  I don't know if that's the truth or not.  See, in these shit pictures, what you don't see is...  You're a tooth in them.  Wow.  Do you know what that story is? 
[02:17:00]  His chest laying under it.  Wait, what's the tooth story?  He swallowed his own tooth.  It fell out my crown.  And then he had to go through his poop.  Oh, no way.  I was like, CSI the next day.  Why?  I can hear him in the bathroom and go, what are you doing?  He's like...  Why would you fish out your own tooth?  Because it's, like, over a thousand dollars for a crown.  At that point, you've got to let it go.  You've got to get a new one.  You think of that when you're kissing him now? 
[02:17:30]  That, like, that's him fucking sitting in logs?  Like, I'm kissing his body.  Wait, is it back in your mouth?  It's not the worst thing they get to me.  Yeah, of course.  They sterilized it.  It's back in his mouth.  Well, why would I take to it?  For a fucking souvenir?  You're going to lose this battle.  Trust me.  That is disgusting.  You've got to throw it out.  You're on NBC.  You shouldn't be searching for a tooth in your shit.  Well, let me tell you.  What did you use?  Huh?  What did you use?  I put on those gloves that, you know...  Did you have to squish each log?  Did you squish it with your hands?  Well, here's what happened.  My body's going to lose this.  Did you have to rubber band the gloves so they didn't slide off? 
[02:18:00]  Oh, wait.  Oh, wait.  That's a piece of corn.  Wait, hold on.  I fucked.  The first day, because it didn't come out the first day, I went through each log like this,  and it was like...  You crunched them off?  I kept crunching it like that.  Where?  Over where?  Well, what I did was I put up a big hefty bag in the toilet, like, so it wouldn't drop  in the water.  It landed on the bag.  Oh, so you didn't crap in the water.  You crapped on the bag.  I crapped on the bag.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  You crapped on the bag?  Genius.  Yeah, I crapped on the bag, and then I put the bag up. 
[02:18:30]  Rich, you need money.  No.  You sure?  What the fuck?  It's $1,500, $1,000.  Sometimes you've got to cut your losses.  The other half of those would fucking do the same thing, okay?  That's the key point.  The other half wouldn't, Rich.  The half that are unemployed listening to this show right now.  Yeah, the half that have been on NBC would probably just get a new tooth.  Exactly.  Oh.  Well, so you're squishing it.  Yeah, well, the first day, it didn't come out.  I'm going, oh, shit, now I'm scared it's stuck in me.  It's going to cut up my insides, because it's a piece of metal.  It's a crown, you know? 
[02:19:00]  And then fucking, you know, the next day, though, I was slick.  I just took a bag, and I pressed it together, and I went like that.  You feel something hard in there.  Yeah, I feel something hard in there.  And you really found it?  Did he jump up and down for joy?  I was so fucking...  Did he just rinse it off and pop it back in?  Yeah.  I rinsed it.  Yeah, he just...  A couple more visuals for radio.  Hey, I like her visuals.  Wow, that is rank.  It was funny when I asked her, I said, do you think of that when you're kissing Vos? 
[02:19:30]  I don't know if anybody caught him.  She said, I think a lot worse stuff than that goes through my mind when I'm kissing him.  Well, you guys were great on the show last night.  Thank you for opening for me.  You guys set a good tone.  Bananas, Hesperkites.  No, last night, the quiz show.  Him and Colin.  But as we move forward, you guys will be at Bananas in Hasbrok Heights all weekend long.  Yeah.  Vos, very, very funny.  And Bonnie, very, very funny.  Are we done?  If you're looking for...  No, no, no, no.  We try to get a lot of plugs in.  You're not done.  Newest name on Wack Bag, Shittooth. 
[02:20:00]  Congratulations to Shittooth.  Welcome to the board.  Welcome to the board, my friend.  That's great.  Someone up there goes, Vos' Tumor.  They are very creative on those boards.  Vos' Tumor?  Yeah, that's his fucking name.  Wait a minute.  Bill hasn't smelled your ear.  Who's Bill?  Bring in Bill.  Where's Bill?  I hope I have something.  Bring in Bill.  I said, where do you want to do this?  He's got a stinky ear and a shit tooth. 
[02:20:30]  He's taken, ladies.  All right, Bill.  They actually smell like grape jelly.  It's silly.  It's so good.  Here's Bill.  Was your father in the talking head?  Good visuals.  Talk about a visual reference.  What?  Am I giving him some ear?  I don't know if I have any.  No, you just made fun of her visuals.  Then you did a visual.  Oh, you're right.  Now, what's going to happen?  He's cut off the slack.  He's dumb.  What's going to happen here?  I do think she's so fucking cool because she reads books all the time. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, of course.  I just wish we're puzzled.  What's going to happen?  Hold on.  Before you do it.  You've got to get a point.  What he's going to do.  Is Rich is going to rub behind his ear.  Uh-huh.  This is legendary on the program.  Then you are going to sniff the tip of his finger.  Yeah.  It's not a joke.  It's not a gag or anything.  We just want to know what it smells like because some people have said it smells like strawberries  or grape jelly.  Grape jelly is the most common.  Other people have said other things.  Grape jelly.  What's that?  We're going to warn Bill.  It's a horrific, horrific smell. 
[02:21:30]  He ruins it every time.  Every time.  Why?  Because the gag is for them to not know that it's bad.  Was that real bad?  It was bad.  Oh, because you've got to eat.  If you don't like grape jelly, it's bad.  What?  I'm going to defend myself.  Did you know it was going to be bad or good?  He's not stupid.  And when I did it for the first time and dry heaved in a parking lot at a train station,  I also knew it was going to be horrific, Anthony.  I was having sex with him.  He thought I was having an orgasm.  Oh, my God. 
[02:22:00]  That's what I...  She's not funny.  I know.  She's like this.  Who's opening for who to add bananas?  Wow.  I think we're waiting for a camera.  All right.  Yeah, the video camera.  I don't think I ruin it.  Rich destroyed that night.  We'll try it another way, but these guys are stupid.  No, no, I know, but you should always say grape jelly.  All right, grape jelly.  I'm sorry.  That's right.  I'm not feeling so good about myself right now.  I'm trying to, you know...  No, you know something?  Let me tell you something, Rich.  Every single time you say, I don't think I got it, or I don't think it's good, or I don't 
[02:22:30]  think...  Every single time.  And it is just as rancid.  You've never tried it.  I've never tried it.  I never will.  You should one time.  No.  Come on.  I will never...  You got that badly.  I will leave.  I will run.  I will jump from this window before I...  How about a quick whiff?  Never, ever, in your fucking wildest hallucination, just drink your Robitussin, or whatever you're...  Buckley's tastes awful and it works.  Which one?  You got a tummy ache or something? 
[02:23:00]  He has too many vitamins.  Oh.  I actually feel better.  He came in and said he has too many vitamins, so he's squeamish.  Best cough medicine ever.  It's a cough medicine.  This you can smell, right?  What do you put in your coffee?  Let him smell it.  It's got to be the, like, horrific...  It's good stuff.  No alcohol.  You should keep that available for him to smell after.  That smells like a baby diaper.  Yeah, it smells like ammonia.  Yeah.  Ammonia.  That's what baby diapers smell like.  I know.  This Vos ear tumor juice thing is legendary.  You should let him smell it after to get rid of it. 
[02:23:30]  Many people have puked after doing exactly what Bill's about to do.  All right, Rich.  That's right.  Do it, and then right away, so it doesn't lose its...  Oh, there's a lot here.  Oh, my God.  This is so...  It doesn't lose its potency.  What?  He went back for a second wish.  Wow.  That's why we love Bill.  Oh, my God.  He's gagging on his own ear.  It's not as bad as I thought it would be.  Oh, Bonnie's hip. 
[02:24:00]  Now you know what I feel like every time I go down on you.  Oh, my God.  I thought I had one of the best-tasting pussies you've ever had.  Yeah, didn't he say that one?  Dude, I can smell from here.  I can smell from here.  Don't even think about it.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, Mr. I'll...  Why does he go...  Jimmy goes, don't even think about it.  I'll...  And then goes for a zipper.  What were you going to do?  My belly button.  Oh.  Why?  Your belly button, Rick?  It's not as bad as this thing, but it's...  All right, let Bill smell that.  He'll decide.  No, but it's worse.  It's worse.  It's worse.  I can tell you it's worse. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  That's horrible.  My belly button is nothing compared to that.  All right, Bill, what do you think?  I once found a dead sea turtle on the beach, rotting out, and it kind of, from six feet  away, smells kind of like that.  Like a rotting sea turtle.  Dude, you've got to go wash it.  Yeah, yeah, immediately wash it.  No!  No!  He puts it on the unfunniness.  Still, it wasn't that bad.  Dude, you've got to go wash it.  It wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  This was as bad as it could be.  Throw that away. 
[02:25:00]  Dude, I can smell it from here.  Yeah, go.  Go smell your...  Go wash it.  Go wash it.  Wash your hands.  Bill, open the door for him, please.  Don't let him touch it.  Get the Lysol.  Where's the fucking Lysol?  We need it.  Where's the Lysol?  Holy shit.  That is worse than any fart I've ever cut.  It's fucking meaty.  You're an awful Jew.  All right, the Lysol's being sprayed.  There goes Voss.  All right, quickly lock the door.  Holy shit.  It smells like...  It smells like a foot.  An infected foot.  An infected foot? 
[02:25:30]  Dude, that is...  Do my farts bother you guys the way that bothers me?  Oh, yeah.  It's good.  I mean, that smells bad, but Big A's worse.  He can't look at it.  Dude, what's worse?  Big A's breath.  Wow, Big A's breath worse than Voss' ear.  At close range, I would say.  At close range.  Depends on how many yards out you are.  Hey, guys, let's lock the door.  We don't really need Voss.  We got Bonnie.  Yeah.  He would be so pissed off.  Wait, is that bad?  It's not fun to look at.  All right. 
[02:26:00]  Well, you know what?  Voss will be back in a second here.  Wait, can we get a video to show, Voss?  Which one?  I want to get Helper Rascal.  I want to show Helper Rascal.  Yeah, yes.  If we can find it.  If we can find the video.  Steve, can you bring in Helper Rascal, please?  You know what?  We could go into the Internet Predator thing.  Where's Nathaniel?  Yeah.  Nathaniel's in studio.  He checked us out on the Today Show this morning.  They're getting Predators left and right these days.  Predator.  The sting operations are getting more and more involved.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:26:30]  What the hell's going on out there?  There's a party going on.  There's more people sitting, watching.  Right.  More people coming in every day.  We have a live audience every day.  It's just people that kind of sit out there.  There's like 10 people outside the studio today.  Watch the show through the glass.  Nathaniel.  It's like the Today Show.  Yeah.  Yeah, just like it.  Nathaniel went on stage after Norton.  Had a decent set last night.  Nathaniel's good, but I'm here.  Yeah, I didn't know.  How long have you been doing comedy?  About a year and a half.  Go get me a coffee.  He was good. 
[02:27:00]  He got laughs and stuff.  Cute.  He got laughs.  He was good.  Yeah.  Thanks, Rich.  You got some, too.  Rich destroyed last night.  45 minutes.  Everybody did.  Colin is so fucking funny.  Yes, he is.  He just went up and started trashing off the top of his head, everybody.  Hold on.  Let me explain something to the first year in the business.  He didn't do it off the top of his head.  He's done all that stuff before.  No, my coat was off the top of his head.  That was, yes, but the rest of the stuff was.  Okay.  Funny.  He said about, uh, Patrice, uh, what did he say? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Ah!  Jesus.  It wasn't even your bit, and you fucked it up.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  He said Patrice would have kicked Rosa Parks out of his head.  Just because you're a, just because you're a woman.  Yeah.  Because you're a woman.  All right.  We got the.  That was a funny joke.  I just forgot.  Nathaniel, uh, what's this internet predator thing about?  Well, uh, Dateline teamed up with the paper.  Why is that? 
[02:28:00]  That mic sucks.  That mic's great.  Sure does.  Well, um, Dateline teamed up with the paper.  Can we put the echo effect on sometime for us?  I wish.  We don't have one.  We don't have one.  Opie.  Uh, Wiki's listening to the show.  You gotta do something with these, uh, wireless mics.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Go ahead, Nathaniel.  Here's mine.  Thank you, Opie.  Wow.  Um, hi.  Micah the master.  Oh, you gotta.  Yeah.  The, uh, Dateline teamed up with the.  Yeah.  Will you shut up, Derek?  He's doing a talk back in my ears.  Oh, he is? 
[02:28:30]  What a prick.  Uh, yeah, Dateline teamed up with the perverted justice people.  Yeah.  To, uh, try to trap, and sort of rented out a house and tried to trap predators.  Now, perverted justice, these are people that have a website, uh, and what they do is they,  uh, they get into chat rooms posing as children, and they catch guys, uh, trying to have sex  with, uh, underage, little cute little kids.  Yeah.  And, and, and they, they print up the transcripts of the conversation, they get as much information 
[02:29:00]  out of these people as they can, their place of work, address, things like that, and they  print it on their website.  Pervertedjustice.com, they put up pictures, phone numbers, everything.  Yeah, because then as, as the child, uh, as they're playing the part of the child, they  ask, hey, could you, you know, email me a picture of you naked, and they get the  naked picture, and that goes up on their website, so they really embarrass these guys,  uh, who, you know, are just out looking for a little fun.  I, I don't, I heard one guy, they got twice. 
[02:29:30]  Twice?  Two different locations in two different days.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, I heard that.  But now they've taken it to the next level.  The fireman?  The fireman?  The New York fireman, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Fireman.  Fireman.  The fireman rapist?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are you talking about the one they did on, uh, with, uh, uh, what's his name?  Stone Phillips.  Stone Phillips.  Stone Phillips.  They did this in Michigan, too, right?  They did this a while ago.  This is another news story to this, too.  Yeah, this is not Stone Phillips.  This is some new guy.  So what, but what they did now this time was they rented a house? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  And then they, they posed as a child.  Yeah.  And then, like, they'd have one of the, uh, because the audio's not, it's a little faint  here.  They had one sort of younger person, younger sounding person saying, like, hey, uh, I'll  be right there.  I'm changing my shirt from the other room.  Um, and then they'd have the predator walk into the kitchen, and then some dateline reporter  would be standing there.  Now, but, but, but they gave the predator, I guess, online the address of this place?  Yeah.  And said, come over my house?  Yeah. 
[02:30:30]  And he thought he was going to see a little boy.  Mommy's not home?  Yeah.  A boy or a little boy or a little girl?  Either or.  These were, uh, little boys in this case.  Oh, that's really sick.  What?  Yeah.  Why don't they get, why don't they get a little boy in there and just, like, let him  lead the guy into the kitchen?  Then we're afraid the kid's going to get hurt?  You can't use a kid in a sting operation?  No, of course not.  Why not?  Just, the kid's dressed.  They put him in, like, a little seashell undershorts.  It's a guy's a little ass.  That's going to work, number one.  Traumatizes the little fella.  Why?  Just saying, hello, mister? 
[02:31:00]  Here's, uh, some audio, Anthony.  As part of our undercover investigation, we enlisted the help of a sort of vigilante organization  called Perverted Justice.  It's volunteer.  Perverted Justice.  He doesn't even like saying it.  It's called Perverted Justice.  I've got my professional broadcaster voice on.  Perverted Justice.  We teamed up with a vigilante group called Perverted Justice.  As part of our undercover investigation, we enlisted the help of a sort of vigilante organization 
[02:31:30]  called Perverted Justice.  It's volunteers pose as 12, 13, and 14-year-old boys and girls in AOL and Yahoo!  chat room, trying to expose adults who solicit them for sex.  Our decoys are hit up almost immediately, and it wasn't long before men started showing up  at our house.  Altogether, 19 in three days.  If that number doesn't shock you, what some of these men do for a living certainly will.  Well, this man is a special education teacher. 
[02:32:00]  Our decoy is now posing as a 13-year-old boy named Brandon the teacher is expecting to meet.  Just set the kitchen counter for a bit.  Where are you?  Oh, okay.  I need to get my new shorts on.  Okay.  The teacher is 54 and married.  When I confront him, at first he says he thought Brandon was an adult.  Well, you said he was 23.  What's the problem?  I have the transcript.  That's what the problem is.  I hope so.  Brandon said he was 13. 
[02:32:30]  13?  13.  And the teacher knows this because Brandon told him online.  You can talk about all the different things that you'd like to do with him.  What are you doing here?  I thought I would come see him.  Come see him for what?  I wanted to meet him.  What is a 54-year-old man doing coming to this home to see a 13-year-old boy?  I obviously made a big mistake.  You're a red kid.  Touch him.  Obviously, I made a big mistake.  This time.  Why don't you just turn around and run out?  When is this going to air? 
[02:33:00]  I know.  He's just signing releases.  Can he get his aftercard for that?  First of all, why do they let him out of jail?  They let him out.  They're going to keep doing it.  Just fucking lock him up forever.  I don't think any of these guys were in jail or even suspected of it.  No, any of the president.  Any of the president.  These are guys.  This is the new bunch.  Yeah.  This is just guys that are, you know, trolling the websites trying to hook up.  These are the rookies just joining the league.  Rookies.  They don't understand.  You know the difference, though, with women pedophiles is that, like, after they get out of prison, 
[02:33:30]  they'll marry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Marry and have kids and family.  It's all nice.  They're nice.  Guys are such scum.  Guys will just have sex with the kids and they're out of there.  Ditch the little kids.  Dear diary, he left today.  My ass didn't even stop bleeding before he was out.  Oh, wow.  Then he cut off my arms and threw me under some leaves in a ditch. 
[02:34:00]  Hilarious.  Oh, he left because there was a cockroach on the wall.  Sounds like a long-distance dedication.  He promised me a puggle.  A puggle.  We got another clip here.  This man thought he'd had a sexually charged chat online with a 13-year-old boy,  a boy he thinks he's about to meet.  Hello?  Hi.  Hey, hold on a second.  I got to change my shirt.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Isn't that the thing? 
[02:34:30]  It's a skull that I coat on.  I got to ask.  Are you still going to be out for tonight?  We'll see.  Oh.  We'll see.  Oh.  So how can I help you?  He's like drooling.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  I'm going to fuck this boy.  Does he know who he is?  Here's my gambling card.  Yeah, I came to have sex with a young boy.  Problems?  Could you get the camera out of my face?  How much would you not love it if the guy just went,  God, how old are you?  You lie.  You said you were a kid.  You're a liar. 
[02:35:00]  I might be a pedophile, but you're a liar.  At least my picture was accurate.  Hey, this kid's mine.  You move it on down the street.  Find your own camera.  Sicko.  Can your son come out?  Back to the clip.  What are you doing here?  Not something good.  This isn't good.  Not good.  That's kind of an understatement, isn't it?  Judgmental.  Not good.  What do you do for a living? 
[02:35:30]  To hang a rabbi.  That's right.  A rabbi.  Now, presumably, you counsel families and children in your position as a rabbi.  What are you doing as a man of God, as a rabbi, in this house, trying to meet a 13-year-old boy?  Instead of answering, the rabbi asked to know who I am.  But before I tell him, I want to ask him about some obscene pictures he sent our decoy.  You sent pornographic pictures.  Okay, that's a federal offense right there.  Okay, look. 
[02:36:00]  You know I'm in trouble, and I know I'm in trouble.  I am not interested in getting any further.  The rabbi and virtually every other man who showed up claimed it was the first time they  had ever done something like this and wouldn't actually have had sex with a minor.  And one 13-year-old boy showed up.  What are they there for, then?  They're not going to have sex with him or some kind of sexual contact of any kind. 
[02:36:30]  They're going to the house.  I was going to counsel him.  Is bar mitzvah coming up?  First of all, at one time, it's one fucking Jew out of all these stories.  There's two million priests, okay?  But all of a sudden, they finally find a Jew rabbi.  And he's probably not even a rabbi.  He's probably like a cantor or a low-budget rabbi.  You know what I'm saying?  He's a rabbi.  That's what he said.  He's probably not a curly Jew rabbi.  You know, the whole...  The same thing going on, only they're making the fucking house calls. 
[02:37:00]  It's not like the Catholic Church.  They have to go to the church.  These kids are like, hello?  Shalom.  No, I'll come to you.  We got Eric from Atlanta.  Eric?  Hey, guys.  How you doing this morning?  All right, Eric.  Since you got little Jimmy and Voss and everybody there, can you guys play the sex offender game?  Do we have time to get the whole game together, though?  It's one of our favorites.  That's a process.  We got to get pictures.  We got to get bios.  We got to get all the rules in place.  All the rules.  We got to get all the other stuff.  We got to get the pictures. 
[02:37:30]  Jimmy's going back to LA after today.  When he comes back in two weeks, we'll play the sex offender game, okay?  You guys remember that?  Yeah.  The boys will remember that, and we'll have it all set up nice when Jimmy gets back, okay?  It's never a 13-year-old boy or girl, guys out there.  Why are they still showing up?  Because every time it turns out to be the law or dateline or something, you're never hooking up.  Now they're just doing it to fuck with these guys because it's just not happening anymore on the Internet.  What did they do with these gentlemen after they showed up at the house? 
[02:38:00]  Were they arrested?  I would hope they would have been arrested and not just, you know, sent down on their way.  Than is back.  Oh, boy.  Here comes the time.  Than, what, you know, since it was some kind of a press sting, was it also the police involved?  No, they didn't show anybody getting hauled away.  So they just taped them and?  Yeah, and just aired them naturally.  Their lives are pretty much ruined.  Yeah, I think the guy said after the report that the rabbi has since left his place of work. 
[02:38:30]  Rabbi-ed them.  Did they buzz out the face?  No.  Now, how did they do that?  How do you not need releases?  Because it's news, I think.  It's news, yeah.  They use it.  Here's the thing.  Oh, no, it's like a Mike Wallace thing.  Wow.  They just show up and they probably just need permission of the venue, like, wherever they  are, because then if you're invited, it's like a vampire.  Once you invite the predator in, then you can photograph him.  What did you cross the line of, you know, I mean, like, just people that just, even the  people that go to rest areas on the parkway and drill holes. 
[02:39:00]  Like, at what point in your life, that you don't even look at cock on the internet, that  you've got to stick your eye on your knee and put your eye through a hole that you drilled  in the rest.  Where does it go wrong?  Tell me, Norton.  Where does it go wrong?  What happens?  Last night, we were watching Oprah and some fucking...  That's where it goes wrong, Richard.  Richard.  Wait, hold on.  Well, she was watching...  And some country singer was on and her boyfriend beat the fuck out of her and she was all black  eyed.  What a stereotype.  She looked really beaten up and Bonnie goes, well, she doesn't look bad beaten up, right? 
[02:39:30]  She did look good.  But this guy's life is fucking ruined because he kept flashing his picture, you know, for  fucking smacking the broad.  They won't say what the broad said, you know.  Fucking listen.  All right.  Listen.  Rich.  We've got to interrupt everything.  Oh, you're sticking up for the guy?  You're saying he doesn't?  Yeah, somehow it seems like Richard is sticking up for...  And I agree with Rich.  These pedophiles, don't they have any rights?  I mean...  We've got to interrupt everything because when Anthony's stepfather calls, you've got to go  right to him.  Oh.  It's the great Sal.  Sal.  Sal. 
[02:40:00]  Hello.  Hi, Sal.  How are you?  Good.  How's Mommy?  Is she doing that so...  She's fine.  She lost money yesterday, so she's not happy.  What?  Doing...  Mohegan Sun.  Where was she playing?  Where was she gambling?  Mohegan Sun.  Oh, Mohegan Sun.  Yeah, no good.  Them engines steal him lots of wampum.  Yeah, she don't want to go anymore.  No.  She's on a losing roll.  Go to the Borgata.  What's the game of choice for Mommy?  Mommy likes the three-card poker.  I love three-card. 
[02:40:30]  Three-card poker.  You lose your ass, but you have a lot of fun doing it.  Is she playing that so-doku thing?  No.  What?  Yeah, she's doing that every day.  Every day in the paper, she plays that game, and she accuses one of her friends in the neighborhood  of cheating with a computer.  There's a battle going on.  Battle Royal with the so-doku.  So, anyway, what's with the billboard?  I mean, it's two blocks from my house.  Is that a coincidence?  Oh, they got a billboard up over there? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Right here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it the one right under the railroad tracks?  That's the one.  Yeah.  You know something?  Every time I drove by there, I went, that would be a good place for a billboard.  So, you know exactly where it is?  Yeah.  The picture's up on opianthony.com.  How proud.  Look, they have to drive past my billboard to go home every day.  I think it's our first XM billboard.  Yes.  There's no lights on it for nighttime. 
[02:41:30]  Uh-oh.  We were sitting there at 10 o'clock last night trying to see it.  We're going to have to strap some mag lights on it.  That is so sad.  Great.  We're on a billboard without electricity.  And your parents are basically, they got high-powered flashlights trying to see it.  Trying to get the headlights on it.  High beams.  Are there light chairs out there?  We pulled off the side to see if my high beams would see it.  I would have wanted to take some pictures.  Yeah.  You need a screwy headlight to see our billboard.  You remember that character they did when you did that thing at the ballroom? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's the picture that's on there.  The little cartoon character.  Well, we're going to be taking professional photographs in a couple of weeks.  And we actually have to go out shopping for some clothing, which I'm thrilled to death about.  You are.  You always dress nice.  I have enough clothes.  It's obviously, they're saying Opie needs to get new clothes.  They don't want to insult him, so I have to tag along.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  I'll buy a new shirt.  Well, Sal, I'm glad the billboard is right there in your neighborhood. 
[02:42:30]  And I'm glad that XM is starting to show people that we're here.  Get your hand away from me.  What a coincidence.  They should do that.  I mean, put it right there.  I said put it by my mommy and Sal's house.  Remind them that I'm this successful child.  All right, Sal, we've got to run.  All right.  They're telling me you've got to go.  Let me know later.  Thank you, Sal.  All right, Sal.  Okay. 
[02:43:00]  Bye, Sal.  And stepfather.  There he goes.  What's that, Long Island?  Yeah.  And we're at Us Weekly as well.  There's a huge plot.  And then Jersey's got some.  Look, right there.  Bonnie, turn right to us.  Turn to the page.  You'll see our faces.  Look at that.  Wow.  That's kind of cool, right?  Very cool.  They're starting to advertise.  Show her the big ad, Jim.  This Us Weekly thing is a pretty big magazine.  We're right in the middle of the damn thing.  No, this ad is the better one.  Yeah, look at this ad.  Me.  Is this all different poos?  I guess so.  Someone emailed them to me. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, Mitch Bick.  Mitch Bick.  Right.  Yeah, well.  All right, we're going to take a break.  When we get back, we've got to talk about Bruce Kelly.  One of our friends is leaving XM Satellite Radio.  Oh.  And you know who else is coming up?  Help a Rascal.  Well, no, that wasn't a joke.  It was a...  I understand.  Help a Rascal's coming.  Help a Rascal.  Anthony, we played this earlier.  We're going to play it again as we go to break.  A lot of speculation going on.  Oh, of course.  There will be a meeting with an arch enemy in the near future. 
[02:44:00]  We've been talking about this off and on all week.  There's a speculation thread on whackbag.com.  So Tom took some audio from the show and came up with this little thing, okay?  Right.  Your friends become your enemies, and your enemies become your friends.  A lot of people talking.  Isn't it funny when you read the message board, the speculation thread, and they grab like a word that was said during a sentence,  and just run with it, and it's completely wrong.  BCN, and that is getting over there. 
[02:44:30]  And then we hate everyone that was at WAF.  Jeremy.  Tim Sabian.  Jim Brewer.  I've never quoted him as a joke.  We're going to be taking a meeting with an arch enemy in the very near future.  With an arch enemy.  You've got to think they're going to help us eventually.  I believe this meeting will be going down in the very near future.  You're meeting with Mr. Mioc, Pat Morita?  No joke.  An arch enemy.  We might not have a choice.  Might not have a choice at this time. 
[02:45:00]  That's how I'm justifying this stupid meeting, by the way.  Wow.  It all makes sense now.  It has to happen.  It has to happen, Anthony.  You lose all your friends, and then your enemies become your new friends.  Balls Deep from Board Planet.  He just thinks he knows everything. 
[02:45:30]  You know what?  Ban.  Ban.  Ban.  Balls Deep is being banned.  You can't ban him.  Why not?  He can't get every magazine in the mail.  Fucking idiots, he calls us.  He can't.  All right.  You can't ban him.  There's a lot of magazines out there.  You can't read all of them.  Jesus.  You can't read all the magazines out there, Anthony.  All right.  Last chance for Balls Deep.  Next time, though, banned.  What is this that you just handed me? 
[02:46:00]  Does anybody ever get banned?  Every time I'm in here, you're going to ban somebody, and Opie goes,  Oh, come on.  No.  Way to wreck the bed, Bill.  No.  Jesus.  Oh, did I ruin it?  Yes.  That's the bed.  Thanks.  Geez.  Thanks for being so observant.  Really am a fucking idiot.  Gee, that was a...  Look at them dying in there.  Did I really just expose one?  I had no idea.  What the fuck?  If I can figure it out, these people at home can't figure that out?  I didn't think people could figure it out.  I thought our acting was up to par on this one. 
[02:46:30]  We were doing a great job of acting the part that I was really adamant about banning him.  Way to go, Bill.  Way to go.  Well, why don't you have somebody give me a list of some of your top ten little bits here,  and I won't expose them.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to cross that bit off the list.  Let's just scrape that one off that page.  I guess that bit is finally done.  Thanks, Bill.  There it is.  Just erase that.  Way to be so observant.  Jesus.  Let me see.  Billy Burr.  Let me ban him right now. 
[02:47:00]  Don't worry, because I won't really, because I never do.  See, that's the game.  In studio today, Rich Voss and Bonnie. 
[02:47:30]  They're playing, well, I guess we should call you the Vosses.  Yeah.  Right?  The Vosses.  Are you keeping your stage name?  Yeah.  So it's Bonnie McFarlane.  She was going to change it to Silverman for more work.  Actually, her career is going great.  We're going to change my name to McFarlane.  I'm going to McFarlane.  That's what all of your friends call you.  You're going to be at Bananas. 
[02:48:00]  Bananas.  Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey.  Tonight.  We make fun of Rich horribly on this show, but I'm telling you, his stand-up is unbelievable.  He crushed last night.  We've got to separate the two.  I'm telling you, Voss kills on the stage.  Thank you.  He's a dope on the radio, but man, he knows how to do stand-up.  What a compliment.  Dope on the radio.  Yeah.  I just got to win over to new listeners.  The old listeners know the whole history of the show.  They understand.  It's winning over to new listeners.  They get it.  That's all. 
[02:48:30]  It's really crazy.  This week, we were talking to people that are hardcore fans.  They've been listening, what, three months?  It's so weird to us.  Yeah.  Because then we go, God, you have no idea what you've missed.  I remember when I did fucking stand-up in the parking lot in D.C.  Ah, the good old days.  To an angry crowd.  Yeah.  God.  You bring that up every time.  That's why we call this the virus.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  If you're really getting infected and really want to go deep with this show, go to oavirus.com.  It has all our old bits.  I think we should do another roast. 
[02:49:00]  I got some old tapes.  I got a tape of when I was on Zone London.  All right.  You bring that in.  You weren't listening a little earlier because you probably were in transit.  Anthony and I will finally play our first show we've ever done together.  But if we're going to do it, we're going to do it right.  So bad.  So when Jimmy comes back from L.A. in two weeks, we're going to do it during that two-week period.  The listeners, you can remind us we will make this happen.  We're going to invite Voss in.  We're going to invite Bonnie in.  And, of course, Patricia.  You know, I actually have a defense here. 
[02:49:30]  I wasn't even in radio.  I was a guest on your show.  You're defending it.  We haven't even played your page yet.  I wasn't even an employee.  I had a day job.  I was a guest on your show.  Anthony, people understand.  It's so bad.  People understand.  They understand.  I'm just so happy to be there.  I probably drank so much beforehand.  Not probably.  I drank so much beforehand.  We attempted to play this, I don't know, six months ago.  We got maybe two minutes into it. 
[02:50:00]  It was so uncomfortable, especially for Anthony.  It was uncomfortable for me as well.  I'm just laughing.  We just stopped the tape.  So we'll do it when Jimmy comes back from L.A. the next time, okay, in a couple weeks.  All right.  Please, God, have Jimmy's plane crash.  No.  Teasing, of course.  Then Rich will bring in his Joan London thing, and we'll have fun.  Oh, I got some bad.  Oh, I got tapes that are so bad from last month.  Was it curly mullet, Voss?  It was so curly down to here.  And even John Davison made a fucking comment on my hair. 
[02:50:30]  And his hair was like, you know, like a move on.  Yeah, John Davison.  All right, listen.  We got to move forward.  What kind of video you got there, Hawk?  Aw, it's those cute little racist girls.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  No, wait.  You mother fucker.  Oh, wait.  Why don't you just play it?  Oh, God.  Is this Helper Rascal?  Holy crap.  What's going on with it?  I don't know.  It's Helper Rascal.  Oh, my God.  You did it.  What is wrong with you?  I didn't know that's what was going on. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, my God.  It's like a moray eel going back into its little cage.  Oh, Jimmy.  Holy shit.  Oh, look.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, why don't we...  All right, listen.  Help that rascal a little while, don't you?  Hold on, I don't know.  Help that rascal.  Cue it up.  Bring in our studio audience.  Bring in our studio audience.  Bring in everybody.  We want a huge audience to check out this video to get the reaction. 
[02:51:30]  Call us the right name, Opie.  What?  It's called Helper Rascal.  Helper Rascal.  Turn the monitor, though.  Yeah, the name of the video is called Helper Rascal.  Helper Rascal.  I'm going to shit myself.  All right.  Yeah, everyone over there behind Bonnie and Voss, we're going to have a...  Here, get the live mic.  We can't get audio, too, though?  Hey, that's the dude that was a little Connor Peterson at the Halloween party.  Oh, look at him.  We can't get audio?  Huh?  No audio, huh?  Audio doesn't matter.  Oh, it helps.  All right, here, get the wireless mics ready, because I want to get the reaction on the  air for everybody.  This video will be up on opiananthony.com later today. 
[02:52:00]  Why?  That'll midge me as good.  All right.  Eric, make it bigger.  Are we ready for the viewing?  Is it happening right now?  It's not bad.  It's just a...  Go ahead, Hawk.  All right, here we go.  We got about...  Eric!  You ruined it!  Oh, there it is.  It's good.  All right, here we go.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, you touch it and then put it on your stomach.  No, it's just that it wouldn't go down. 
[02:52:30]  Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown.  Sick.  The girl's not looking.  The girl refuses to look.  She's not looking.  Miss, you got to watch Help a Rascal.  Help a Rascal.  Are you...  Help a Rascal?  What do you think, ma'am?  Because it wouldn't go down.  Miss?  Who is she?  Who are you?  It's Laurie.  And who are you?  I'm Bill.  Hi, Bill.  What are you guys doing here?  We brought you some T-shirts.  Oh, boy.  Ah.  T-shirts all I'm going to wear.  Great. 
[02:53:00]  Piper Cub T-shirts.  From what?  Piper Cub.  Piper Cub.  Can I see one?  You mean the aircraft?  Yeah.  I love the Piper Cub.  Oh, yeah?  Well, when you're up in Boston area, come see me, and I'll let you fly mine.  Really?  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  There you go.  Can I throw it?  Yeah, you can throw it.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  What do you guys talk?  All kinds of smack.  Yeah, fuck Cessna.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very nice.  It's for a Piper Cub T-shirt.  Oh, it's got a little picture of...  Wow.  And it's on Steve on the...  It's adorable. 
[02:53:30]  Adorable.  Opie.  That's an open invite to anybody here who'd like to come up when you're in the Boston area.  You're a private pilot, sir?  I have a commercial, but I don't use it.  You have a commercial?  For what?  Just a commercial.  I don't have an ATP, and I don't have an instrument rating.  No, I got an original...  Single engine?  Yeah, single engine.  I used to fly aerobatics.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, in fact, it just so happens I have a picture of my old airplane, which is a PIT special.  Oh, nice.  And you can have that.  You can carry it up afterwards after I leave. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, God.  Nobody would do that.  It's no fun when you're in the Boston area.  But anyways, no, and I competed.  For years, and I sold that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Boring.  The guy's doing friggin' barrel rolls and emomens and split S's.  It's wonderful.  I'm not on their show right now.  Flat spins.  Flat spins in plain.  You're there going, ha-ha.  Exactly.  Blumshavaks.  That's very cool.  I want to hear what Harry Dean Stanton has to say.  No, but I can't do that in the Cub. 
[02:54:30]  Well, I can do it once.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But no, I know.  You come up to Boston and take you to J3, sit you in the front seat.  I'll do the takeoff.  Thanks, Ben.  You can do the rest.  In fact, you fly because I've been up on a little, one of those introductory flights  in a Cessna.  Yeah, because you seem to be very savvy.  The door is now open.  Opie, I'm having a conversation with the gentleman about aviation.  Plus, Bill's an antique dealer. 
[02:55:00]  That's wonderful.  Really?  He's got some of my old CDs.  Go over there.  Sir, thank you very much.  Get your Opie and Anthony t-shirts coming by.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Holy crap.  All right.  Listen.  We're running out of show.  What's happening?  Someone is very pissed off that you're snorting into the mic.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Wow.  I know my...  Somebody?  How about 80 people on instant feedback?  Oh, I'm sorry, guys.  That's something I'm not going to miss.  And it's not a little upset.  It's tell that not-sucking motherfucker to shut up.  I'm sorry, guys. 
[02:55:30]  I'm very congested today.  Where's the video of you touching this poop, by the way?  It's not me.  All right.  It's Mitch me.  All right.  Where's this video?  You've got to tell me if the instant feedback is.  I don't realize I'm sniffling.  Just let me know early and I'll stop sniffling.  It didn't bother me.  I don't care.  To annoy those pricks, good.  Keep going.  It's up right now?  Where's the audio of it?  Crap, you know, we have a lot of video up on foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com,  and, of course, opianthony.com.  So far, there have been no views of your video.  It's not my video.  It's Mitch me.  Well, the video you brought to our attention. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, now it's...  Wow.  Now we have 26 people that have viewed it already.  That went quick.  It's really going to go fast.  Oh, it's that disgusting.  Anthony, what?  You've got to help a rascal sometimes.  No, you don't.  It won't go where it needs to go.  You never do.  Anthony, we're going to...  Yes.  All right, everybody.  We're going to get back on the road here.  We're going to get back on the road.  We've got to get serious.  Bruce Kelly is leaving XM.  Yes.  And we want to do this right for Mr. Kelly.  We're trying to get him on the phone, but he's not answering.  No.  Bruce Kelly, a friend, a dear friend of the program, he took a beating from us like no 
[02:56:30]  one has ever taken a beating.  He took it like a man, right, Anthony?  Yeah, he did.  He ran the 80s channel on XM, and he's leaving us for, I guess, personal reasons.  Everything will be all right, but he's leaving for personal reasons.  He has to tender his resignation.  I'm really bummed about that.  We're kind of sad, because we had a lot of fun with him.  We liked the Bruce Kelly.  We sure did.  Remember downstairs, the elevator with his big sweatpants, giant hog, pulling his suitcase 
[02:57:00]  up, his pants up to his nipples.  We only do this every once in a while.  Oh, very rarely do we do this.  We're going to break out the Sarah McLachlan song today.  How did I know you were going to do that?  I don't know why.  I'm on the show.  What?  No, how did I know you were going to do that?  Then it hit me.  Oh, I'm on the show.  We only do it to the people we really, really enjoy.  But we do have some audio clips of Bruce Kelly.  Just some sound bites of Mr. Kelly.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it. 
[02:57:30]  This is Bruce Kelly live from Live 8 or whatever the hell that...  Saw the who and started crying.  And here's another one.  I feel like an idiot.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  It's just overwhelming.  He just lost his mind after seeing that.  I was really crying.  That's it.  Sorry.  You couldn't take it.  You couldn't take it anymore.  More Bruce Kelly audio.  You know, it's just the who.  I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with the who.  Oh.  Oh, hey.  What are you doing here? 
[02:58:00]  I just want to see Roger Daltry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I'm absolutely leaking clear stuff.  This is very awkward.  I'm sorry.  Yes, it's very awkward.  Let's see what else we got here from Bruce.  I'm a fat old disc jockey, and ever since I stopped cocaine years ago, the wait just comes on.  That was him on our show.  I was so happy to be out of the Washington building.  All right.  Let's see.  I guess these don't really make sense unless the song's playing. 
[02:58:30]  I was there, and I had the recorder, and it was Friday sound check, and I shoved it in her.  All right.  Quite frankly, I would love to be teabagged.  Okay.  You would love to be teabagged.  I'm a tool.  I'm a pussy.  He's a tool.  He's a pussy.  Hey, this is a heck of a moving testimonial.  Yeah.  Why don't we just...  Yes, we're live.  All right.  I thought they were longer clips of Bruce Kelly.  I was going to give some moments from the show, Anthony, but they're actually very short clips  that we could fit in between the lyrics of I Will Remember You. 
[02:59:00]  Yes.  I Will Remember You.  This song always used when you're saying goodbye.  All right.  Sorry.  Well, here it is.  Bruce Kelly leaving XM, and we should have just went to this song here.  No, no.  It's good this way.  I'm a fat old disc jockey, and ever since I stopped cocaine years ago, the wait just comes  up.  I will remember you.  That's it.  I'm sorry.  Will you remember me? 
[02:59:30]  This is very awkward.  I'm sorry.  I was so happy to be out of the Washington building.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I don't matter where shit.  Quite frankly, I would love to be teabagged. 
[03:00:00]  I'm a dole.  I'm a pussy.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  I'm a fat old disc jockey.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Really?  No, no.  Hey, look.  That's overwhelming.  Will you remember me? 
[03:00:30]  I was there, and I had the recorder, and it was Friday soundcheck, and I shoved it in  her.  Unless your life pass your blood.  I can't help it to be a 14-year-old kid out there with a hoof.  We've not forgotten.  I was so happy to be out of the Washington building.  Weep not for the memory. 
[03:01:00]  That's it.  I'm sorry.  Well, there you go.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  Oh, that was touching.  Good luck to you, Bruce Kelly.  Good luck to you.  Godspeed.  Au revoir.  Bon voyage.  Well, this would have been much better if you called the show, but for some reason  he doesn't want to call in today.  Maybe, um...  Guy outside has a crystal trophy for Norton. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, what's that about?  Something for HBO.  Didn't he understand Norton is very busy taking a phone call during the show?  No, no, no.  I'm just checking my message.  My doctor's appointment is good.  Your doctor?  Are you okay?  Yeah, I just go ahead and have my foot re...  I'm out of the wild.  Your foot thing on your foot?  Are you going to get a re-broke?  You see more doctors than anyone else.  No, I don't.  Very rarely did I ever go to the...  For years, I didn't go.  You got a foot doctor, you got an eye doctor, you got a nose doctor.  Yesterday, I went for my eye...  I went for my, uh...  Like, I haven't been for contact.  I examined two years.  Where?  The Empire State Building. 
[03:02:00]  My eyes are going crazy.  He's an asshole.  He's an asshole.  At our wedding, my aunt asked Jim what happened to his foot, and he goes,  Oh, I saved a guy from a burning building.  All serious?  Yeah, and it didn't ever break.  What a dick.  Oh, that's so nice.  All right, what do you got, sir?  All right, I actually, uh...  When I was watching Jimmy's One Night Stand, I was drunk and really enjoyed it.  Watched the whole, uh...  On HBO.  Listening for it all that show on HBO, and I actually thought, you know, 
[03:02:30]  it would be a good idea to get Jimmy a trophy.  Oh, thank you.  So, yeah, no, uh, believe me.  If you can actually break this, I'll be impressed.  I won't break this.  What's your name?  What's your name?  I'm Andrew.  Long.  Andrew?  Yeah.  Andrew what?  Long.  How do we know that name?  I have no fucking idea.  Andrew Long.  Oh, nice.  Are you a message board guy?  Yeah, I'm one of many.  Okay.  What board are you on?  I'm a whack bag.  How great is this?  I don't bash boss.  Put it in your bum, Jim.  Well, that could definitely deliver some blunt force trauma. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, look at that.  Patrice has that in his collection.  It does look like one of Patrice's dildos.  How about because it's radio, we explain the trophy there, Andrew.  It's a beautiful trophy.  All right, well, it's a real big obelisk, basically.  It looks like the Washington Monument.  Washington.  It does.  On top of the pedestal that the Statue of Liberty is standing on.  It says, Jim Norton, 2005, HBO, One Night Stand, Champion.  Oh, that's great.  Are you sure that's not one of Patrice's last dildos? 
[03:03:30]  It really does look like it.  It will be if he hates it.  No, I like it.  I'm not going to break this.  That's nice.  It would sound good.  I don't know.  What part of the closet are you going to put that in?  I'm actually going to display this proudly behind my shoes in that one.  Oh, now.  What?  It's nice.  Jimmy, that's very nice.  Just give it to Mom for Christmas.  She'll put it on.  That is like one of the perfect things to give to somebody if you want to get their fingerprints.  Yeah.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  Like, all right, I'll take it back and have it re-inscribed.  That's great.  Thank you very much. 
[03:04:00]  I think that's very thoughtful, Andrew.  That is.  I do.  I think it teeters on gay, but I think it's fucking gay.  It is a little gay.  It's sort of valid.  Not if he works at a trophy shop.  No, but I don't.  A guy.  A guy.  Thank you.  I like it.  It's cool.  Anybody that watches TV or goes to a message board to write to the entertainer, go to the  mirror and say, I'm fat.  Because here's the thing.  I would never buy that fucking zero anything for a fucking comedy show. 
[03:04:30]  Look at that.  But no, no.  It's gay.  It's gay.  Here's what you might not understand.  I was the 2005 one-night stand HBO champion.  And he's got the trophy to prove it.  I didn't understand that.  Got the trophy to prove it.  Where's Bonnie's trophy?  Hey, somebody send me a paperweight.  You got a paperweight in the mail.  Do you have a trophy for Voss?  Is there a one-nighter in Connecticut champion?  Hey, it's Voss.  Hey, it's Voss.  Bananas.  Hey, it's Voss.  Hey, it's Voss.  Hey, it's Voss.  I wouldn't break. 
[03:05:00]  I'm not fucking...  No.  I'd say at least three smacks on the console.  Yeah, that would be hard to break.  I think it's heavy.  And that would make a big mess, which would be hilarious.  That would kill a conference.  By the way, I want to apologize to Rich Voss personally.  When I broke your glass thing, I didn't realize that, you know, we could have all been blinded  that day.  Wow.  Really?  I had no idea.  I thought it was just plastic.  Harry Spears came in here all tough.  Yeah, I was in a radio station calling him out.  And you're smashing glasses going, this fucking guy's crazy.  That glass went flying.  That could have been some serious problems. 
[03:05:30]  Thanks, man.  What did you do for a living?  I worked for a fucking data entry company.  It sucks.  Do you have to bring back that Andy Kaufman wig?  I know I need a haircut.  The guy brings you again.  I know.  And you just tear him.  You gotta get a plan.  What an ass.  All right, anyways.  Thanks, buddy.  There he goes.  Nice.  No, he got it.  You can't say no.  You know what?  I'm thinking, now you might look at that and go, useless, something like that.  I'm thinking, next time you have to help a turd down the toilet, that is perfect. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, it is good.  This is what I'm going to call my aid for the sequel to Help a Rascal.  Help a Rascal, the crystal edition.  That is, let me feel how heavy it is.  It's probably very heavy.  No, you're going to drop it.  I wouldn't have.  Yeah, she's not a fucking...  Passing around the gold telephone.  That's his gig.  All right, let's congratulate him.  Why don't you have your little club hands?  Yeah.  A little stiff non-bent.  You'll drop it by accident.  Anthony, I played that David Spade thing. 
[03:06:30]  I think we should play it for everybody today.  David Spade is doing a show on Comedy Central called Showbiz.  What, Hawk?  250 people have checked out the video that you have acquired.  That made me sense.  Yes.  It's up on opianthony.com.  David Spade's Showtime is the name of the show on Comedy Central.  And, you know, he goofs on celebrities like he does.  You know, I've banned eight people today.  Good boy.  I've banned eight people today.  Why?  Why?  I'm not even asking anymore.  For blatant misuse of the instant feedback, why does Arizona Hogg from Tucson, Arizona have 
[03:07:00]  to type out in caps, what the fuck does sex mean in Sam, sex for Sam?  With, you know, you know when all of a sudden symbols like come in for text sometimes.  Question marks somewhere.  Question marks and weird Arabic looking symbols instead of text.  Right.  That's going through there.  And he's posted it, I don't know how many times, but we will see it no more. 
[03:07:30]  Give him a good banning, Ant.  There are other people that post the same shit like 20 times.  They take up an entire page thinking maybe it'll get my attention.  Maybe I'll read it if they do that.  Well, you got my attention.  You're banned, Arizona Hogg.  Banned.  Sam Adams was the unofficial sponsor for Sex for Sam.  That's why we call it Sex for Sam.  Thank you.  All right.  You make it sound like I made a big deal out of nothing.  I know.  Well, David Spade. 
[03:08:00]  I don't think you overreacted.  Ovi just goes, the Sam is sex for Sam.  That's all you have to say.  And then I'm sitting here going, well, I actually look like an overreacting little ass, don't  I have to say.  You got to have a little patience when you do this job.  And this is coming from me.  Just humor the guy and tell him.  Takes five seconds out of your wonderful life.  All right, I'll unbanned it.  What would you do if your puggle barked late at night, snap its little legs?  Yeah, really.  To take that washcloth and the hammer. 
[03:08:30]  I'm going to bet that you're going to have a little cute doggie soon.  What?  I think you might have one of those little cute doggies soon.  If you think for a second I'm getting a puggle, you're out of your mind.  Changes?  I've seen some changes over the years.  There are no changes.  There will not be a puppy.  There's a cute dog in your future.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  I'm much too fancy a man.  Maybe Tigger the dog?  Remember Tigger, the automatic little mechanical dog?  No, there won't even be mechanical dogs.  My friend had a dog and they were doing work on a roof and they took down the wall on a 
[03:09:00]  roof and the dog ran up the stairs up to the roof and just ran and there was no wall to  block the dog.  All right, now there's a problem.  There's a problem because that was Jimmy's friend.  Oh, yeah, did you tell the story?  It's a problem with my friend, yes.  Yeah.  It was a true story.  Oh, so at least we know the story's true.  Yeah.  I thought it was one of those urban legends that all of a sudden everyone was going to  come in and go.  I was ready to call Bravo Sierra.  Yeah, Jimmy.  And the dog yelled, hit the floor.  I know.  It was raining dogs and dogs. 
[03:09:30]  Okay, one bad one.  No, it wasn't even bad.  No, I'm not even going to crash him on that one.  No, that was just...  That was a sign.  Do you have a car that just runs out of gas?  Speaking of cars.  Where's the latest hybrid story, by the way?  Speaking of cars.  And then we'll get to the David Spade thing.  Basically, he did a piece on the munchkins from The Wizard of Oz, which is pretty fun.  Where's Steve? 
[03:10:00]  You want Steve?  Yeah.  All right, let's go get Steve.  Steve, of course, owns a hybrid vehicle.  Steve bought one of these hybrid cars.  They run on gas, a little bit of gas, and electric power.  And they're supposed to get all kinds of miles in a gallon.  Hi, Steve.  Oh, he has no place to land.  Oh, look, he's looking around.  There he is.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, he found a little spot.  There he goes.  Nice.  He found a place.  Thank you.  Hey, Steve.  Finally landed.  Well, yeah, Steve has a hybrid car. 
[03:10:30]  What's it called?  It's Toyota Prius.  Toyota Prius.  Very popular now.  A lot of people are buying this to conserve fuel.  Runs on gas and electric.  I guess the electric motor takes over when you're, what, going slower, going faster?  The electric motor takes over around 30, 25 miles an hour, and when you're putzing around  the city.  Putzing around the city.  And then on the other times, it runs on that little bit of gas.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm reading.  I was hoping this article wouldn't make it in here.  I'm reading this article that you are not alone. 
[03:11:00]  I know.  I'm not alone.  I love for hybrid vehicles.  I've seen plenty of them on the road.  Let me just say, at least you have a 25% chance.  Hey, let me ask you, is there like, when you pull in, is there a rest area?  Is that where you get your little stuff from?  No, I go to like regular little gas stations, yes.  Oh, you do?  Yes.  At least it's not 100%, Steve.  So, you know, you can hope for the 25%.  And they say, they start off the arc with, it's a little known fact.  No, not at all.  It's a little known fact.  It's pretty obvious.  Well, I like the headline right here. 
[03:11:30]  Gay Americans favor hybrid electric vehicles.  You know, I wondered why I was getting so many waves from other people in hybrid.  Were you waving?  People wave.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a common thing I'm seeing.  When I see like another Prius or another hybrid vehicle, they look over and I go like this.  They wave.  You know, they sort of wave like that.  I wonder if that's because like gay men are like an odd hybrid between male and female sensibilities.  And this is kind of a hybrid between.  It represents them.  Like power, which is the gasoline engine, and electric, which is a vagina. 
[03:12:00]  I think that's on the radio no matter what station you tune in.  I'll give them a good smack laying over the sound system.  It's a little known fact, but U.S. gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender consumers buy cars.  What's more, they show a penchant for the luxury end of the market,  and are significantly more interested in hybrid electric vehicles than their non-gay counterparts.  How do they figure this out, though?  I didn't get a sexual orientation quiz when I bought the... 
[03:12:30]  It was obvious when you walked in.  Maybe because gay guys know how bad gas can be.  You know, if you pull your helmet out and...  No, sorry.  Wow.  Why doesn't he get crashed?  After you bought the car, did you and your boyfriend go to Ikea and buy furniture?  No.  Thanks, Rich.  That's it, Gary.  You couldn't let me suffer alone on that one.  Jimmy, come back into the game.  Coach called me out.  One of the selling points is the headroom between the seat and the steering wheel, though. 
[03:13:00]  Doesn't say that.  There you go.  Thank you, Ian.  I thought that was funny.  There you go.  Headroom between the seat and the steering wheel.  Sorry about that.  Headroom.  I'm an idiot.  I'm getting nothing.  Wow.  Shit.  Try it again.  Push that joke down with my finger.  Help a joke.  Help a joke.  All right.  That's a study, I guess, that Harris Interactive did.  Mm-hmm.  And survey actually proves nothing more than homosexuals, bisexuals, and transsexuals have 
[03:13:30]  jobs, taste, and money to which to indulge them.  Well, the money thing is, the money thing I knew, because a lot of gay guys have disposable  income, because they're not supporting families.  So, oh.  Unlike you, who are married.  Married.  I want to make that point.  Exactly.  And they don't have disposable income.  That money that should be wasted on tuition goes right into medication.  Goes into long hospital stays. 
[03:14:00]  Let's see.  Apparently, Volkswagen, Subaru, Volvo, and BMW are seen as the firms that extend the greatest  outreach to the gay and lesbian, bisexual, transgender community, through their marketing  campaigns.  Are there that many obvious queens walking into car dealerships and buying hybrids?  I just, I don't know.  Regarding hybrid electric vehicles, 51% of the gay community considers it worth paying  the extra for the technology, compared with just 34% of non-cocksuckers. 
[03:14:30]  Well, there you have it.  Wow.  The latest hybrid story, yeah.  Who would have guessed that?  Anybody.  Oh, all right.  Get out of here.  There you go.  There you go, Steve.  Martini Poland.  Oh.  All right.  So, David Spade did a thing on the Munchkins.  Is the Wizard of Oz having an anniversary or something? 
[03:15:00]  Let's see.  1939.  38?  What year did that come out?  39.  39?  So, that would be 60-something.  I think they're celebrating, because one of them actually went a week without being pointed  at and laughed at.  It's not just all about the Munchkins, sir.  I don't know.  There's a DVD coming out with all behind-the-scenes stuff and some outtakes.  Did you know, Anthony, there's only nine Munchkins left?  Only nine little Munchkins.  There's actually nine left? 
[03:15:30]  Nine left and only five that can make the publicity tour.  How many humans are left that were their age?  I don't know.  That were making that?  You figure, how old was your average midget back then?  26, maybe?  20?  I don't even think they...  Yeah.  I think 20.  So, what are they now?  Hopefully they...  How old are these midgets?  I'd say mid-80s.  Mid-80s.  Sure.  That is old for a midget.  Well, they did the press junket and they had to do their catchphrases and stuff.  And, uh...  David's being a little thing on this. 
[03:16:00]  Imagine having to do catchphrases from 39.  Here it is.  Listen to this.  We'll stop it as we go.  This week marked the release of the Wizard of Oz special edition DVD.  And because nothing draws a crowd like a bunch of little people, Sony made sure all the  surviving Munchkins were there on the red carpet for lights, camera, and blatant humiliation.  And follow the yellow brick road.  Here we go.  Follow the yellow brick road.  Follow the yellow brick road.  Follow the yellow brick road.  Now it's like old midget. 
[03:16:30]  It was all nice and high, like back then.  Follow the yellow brick road.  Now it's...  Follow the yellow brick road.  How many times did that little freak have to say that?  Since 1939.  Wow.  That David's being...  He's horrible.  And yes, David Forrest wore those costumes since 1939.  But, turns out this was just step one of an all-out Munchkin Media Blitz. 
[03:17:00]  The next day they appeared on Entertainment Tonight, when they were subjected to more degradation.  Thank you very sweetly for doing it so neatly.  Wake up, you sleepy head.  Rub your eyes.  On the alibic road.  See, don't worry.  Where are you getting...  On the alibic road.  On the alibic road.  Aw, wonderful, wonderful.  Aw, isn't that cute?  They're like puggles, aren't they?  They're just so adorable.  Their catchphrase should be, look, I'm a person, stop hitting me. 
[03:17:30]  They're just adorable.  The cutest little things.  They're like babies who never grow up.  Were they dressed as the munchkins?  Oh, yeah.  Get the fuck...  They love it.  They love it.  You're right.  It's the only way.  What can they do after either do that show or a carnival?  That's it.  That's the fucking line.  How about just live your life?  My brother made a point yesterday.  We were talking to the Oompa Loompas. 
[03:18:00]  There's two Oompa Loompas.  And they were doing an appearance at a hardware store in Syracuse.  Yeah, we didn't realize that until we were all in the bathroom.  I almost got that gig, too.  My brother's like, you realize that they were appearing at a hardware store in the middle of Syracuse?  We were laughing too hard to realize what they said, their appearance, where they said it was at.  And it was a hardware store.  Why were you laughing after this?  There's no reason to laugh.  They're nice people.  That's wrong.  Stop it.  Stop it.  What are you going to...  Like, what's an Oompa Loompa?  You did not just say that, Rich.  Pictures. 
[03:18:30]  Yes, Jimmy.  Come on.  I know you got it.  I just can't believe he doesn't know what an Oompa Loompa is.  He has to.  Do you know what it is?  I'm Canadian.  Oh, you don't know either?  You really don't know what an Oompa Loompa is?  Wow, look at the Voss family.  No.  Oompa.  Oompa.  I'll put it to you this way.  Oompa.  Oh, Slammy's Twins?  Yes.  If you had a green wig on.  Yeah.  And hands like that, you'd be perfect. 
[03:19:00]  Rich, I would go to whackbag.com tonight and go to the Photoshop section to find out what  a Oompa Loompa is.  Inside, he's six feet tall.  Oompa Loompa Loompa Loompa Dee.  Does this sound familiar at all?  I've got another spuzzle for you.  Oompa Loompa Loompa Loompa Dee Dee.  If you are wise, you'll listen to me. 
[03:19:30]  That's the song they sang before they put us on the train.  No.  That's the music he hears in his head when he's watching Jeopardy.  Oh, wow.  Do you recognize it, Rich?  No.  Who the fuck?  No.  I'm sorry.  Who in the park?  It's a cartoon, right?  It's a cartoon, right?  How about everybody?  You never saw Willy Wonka?  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?  Oh, there's no one.  I didn't see the one.  No, no.  The original.  The original.  With Gene Wilder.  I don't remember.  With Gene Wilder. 
[03:20:00]  You don't remember?  But do not know the name?  Oompa Loompa's just famous.  That movie's on, like, every year.  I think it's like one of those Thanksgiving-type movies now.  Oompa.  Oompa.  All right, well, we got a little more of the Munchkins from The Wizard of Oz here.  Something.  By the way, hats off to the Munchkins for giving frat guys across the country something to say  after doing a Whippet.  Correspondent Mark Stein has managed to squeeze in some fun questions, too.  How many Munchkins are still with us today? 
[03:20:30]  Nine, and you have five here.  Yeah, that's nice.  The other four, of course, part of that hot new French show at the Venetian, Mijay.  And let's not forget this stunning revelation made by Munchkin, Barbara Pellegrini.  What we made was $50 a week at our room and board.  As we went on, we found out Toto made more than we did.  In Toto's defense, he was a full-size dog. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, this guy, this guy is, he doesn't take any prisoners, man.  I thought he could only do those Capital One commercials, but man, he really, he can really,  you gotta, don't get on his bad side.  He's probably making a fortune from those commercials.  You're tearing Tinseltown a new one.  Did I actually say that?  What?  Someone's calling me out and saying, you said how many humans are around, like midgets aren't human.  Like, I guess I talk about the midgets thing, how many midgets, and I said how many regular humans are around. 
[03:21:30]  That's what I, I did mean that.  Well, regular humans.  Like just regular people.  Right.  I got, I got it, Anthony.  Yeah, it's okay.  Hey, by the way, we forgot to talk about iPorn today.  It's on the cover of the New York Post.  Everyone saw this coming.  Come on.  Come on.  I got that iPod video thing now.  You buy the iPod, you can get video.  And they're talking about how you can download TV shows like Desperate Housewives.  The day after it airs, you can download it from the internet for something like three bucks. 
[03:22:00]  That's gonna be all the rage.  And then they're talking about now Letterman and Leno being able to download their shows.  Well, there's two different stories.  The Daily News is talking about all the stuff you can download to your phone.  Yeah.  And they're showing an example, David Letterman.  Yeah.  And then the Post has the iPod where you can download, you know, stuff as well.  But they're using the porn example.  It's all tying in, though, to the, you're gonna be able to get video on demand over your phone, 
[03:22:30]  over your iPod, over all these devices.  The thing is, are people really gonna download Desperate Housewives or Letterman or Leno or stuff like that?  Watch it live.  Or Snatch videos.  Yeah.  Or porno.  Because now porn becoming available for the iPod.  It's kind of, you listen to your iPod, it's music, you can do other things, you can exercise, you can drive,  you can do whatever the fuck you want.  You can't kind of watch a TV show as you're doing other activities.  But porno, you absolutely can do it anywhere. 
[03:23:00]  You don't need the sound.  You don't have to pay attention.  You will now be able to go into the bathroom and crank out a batch to living, like, video.  To video.  No more in the air with a magazine or something.  Yeah.  Or your imagination.  Or that stupid imagination.  Trying to stand on the septic tank and peek over the thing at the fellow next to you.  A septic tank?  What?  A septic tank?  No.  No.  A septic tank is something that's in the ground. 
[03:23:30]  In the ground, you fucking idiot.  What do you lift the...  And you're going to way too much work to see the guy next to you.  Wait.  What are they...  It's called the tank, the toilet tank.  Oh, I always called it the septic tank.  A septic tank and the bolt...  No, you're always wrong.  A septic tank?  I know.  A septic tank is the thing that's in the ground.  Yeah.  You ever see those trucks with those big, round cement things with the holes in the side?  No.  You wonder what they are?  Never.  Now you know.  Those were septic tanks.  No, I know what septic tanks are in the yard, but I thought it was called that on the  thing, too.  That's what Opie went for, is Halloween, a septic tank worker. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, was I wrong?  What were you dressed as?  I didn't want to dress.  Jimmy.  Oh, is that real?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course it was.  What do you mean, midge me?  Huh?  I'm not midge me.  I decided not to dress.  Yeah.  I wasn't brave enough to dress in front of our crazy fans.  Only Anthony was brave enough.  I wasn't dressed.  I just planned on going out like that. 
[03:24:30]  Sword.  So, the iPods in the video, and they're talking about how it's going to be all about porn.  Of course it's going to be.  Bill Z is doing a Voss impression on instant feedback.  He goes, what's an iPod?  I just got mine working last week.  I had it since last February, and I was kind of nervous, and I got like 250 songs on it  already.  You know how to use it and everything?  You put all your CDs on it, man.  It's great.  Yeah, so I downloaded my CD.  You put all your CDs onto, you can do it onto the computer.  I would love to know what music you have on there. 
[03:25:00]  It's awful.  It's all classic rock.  Yeah.  Let me just say this.  He did ask me how he could get his tapes on his iPod.  Tapes?  Yeah.  How do I put my tapes on?  Is there a way?  He doesn't have one song before 1974.  It's a digital medium, my friend.  Huh?  It's a digital medium, my friend.  No, I know.  I got my CDs on it.  You would have to transfer, like, your tapes to a...  But that's how old his music is.  ...wave file.  Wow.  I got some good songs.  Dr. O'Toole, fucking locomotive breath.  Oh, yeah, because you don't hear that enough. 
[03:25:30]  You can put on Q right now.  You're going to get one of these video iPods?  I don't know when I can get them later, you know.  Yeah, wait.  You watch.  XM's going to go this route.  What?  Downloadable one?  We're going to come up with hardware.  I've been saying, you know, we need...  I guarantee.  This show is perfect for downloading video on iPods and phones.  Imagine if you get the Cherry Dart thing.  Cherry Dart.  You can have that on your iPod or your phone.  Imagine the Wiffle Bat Challenge that happened. 
[03:26:00]  Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  We'll put that, and all of a sudden you're downloading it.  Is Bob on that now?  Oh, of course.  He's right on top of it.  Steve?  Yeah.  Yeah, we're working on it.  We are.  Yeah, we just...  Jeff and I just got the video iPod in the FedEx yesterday, and we're working on how to  get the videos onto the iPods.  Cool.  How do we all make a little money?  Yeah, I'm talking about making it profitable.  Yeah, we...  Oh.  For once in our lives, Anthony and I want to actually make money.  Well, there have been a dozen offers already, and we can actually talk about that.  You know when people sometimes on instant feedback, 
[03:26:30]  go, oh, you're ready for the paycheck?  Yeah.  I'm going to say, yeah.  It's all about the paycheck.  All right.  Well, uh...  That's why I'm doing this.  We'll hopefully have more news about that in the near future.  Yes.  I love doing this.  Imagine having cherry darts, or...  Oh, my God.  The Whipple Bat Challenge would be perfect, yes.  Stuff like that.  Stuff like that.  Jimmy could put...  Oh, or Midge Me could...  All right.  Well, when they come out with smell, then I'm going to make some money on it.  No, you put your videos. 
[03:27:00]  The Smell Pod, right.  The Smell Pod, yeah.  You could actually...  You get the screen, and you scratch behind your ear, and give it a little sniff.  And you hear...  Like it squirts it out like a little perfume dispenser.  All right.  We're going to break, and then we'll finish the show in just a bit.  We've got Bonnie and Rich Voss in studio.  They're playing Bananas in Hasbrook Heights all this weekend.  This is Greg Opie Hughes on your 4th Play Weekend, where the 4th Cut is always live.  That's a gay Disneyland. 
[03:27:30]  Well, it's not gay if you don't push back.  That's right, Opie.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  They're not gay.  They're not gay.  Running out of show.  Once again, if you're just tuning in, No Filter Paul had an amazing assault on the media last night. 
[03:28:00]  Made the girl leave her post.  The reporter just walked away from the situation.  Left the camera rolling for those two maniacs to remain for a little bit longer,  just jumping up and down like idiots.  And he's the early leader as far as the assault on the media contest goes for November.  Anthony sent me an email last night saying there's no way anyone's going to beat Paul this month.  No.  No.  Did you see this yet?  The video's up on OpieandAnthony.com.  Yeah, we were watching in the office.  Unbelievable.  How funny is it?  It's just unbelievable the extent these guys go to. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, they're getting...  They're saying it's like a drug, basically.  You know, they're just...  What do they say?  They're addicted to this stuff.  Yes.  As soon as they do one, they want to do another one.  They can't wait to do another one.  And they're getting more and more creative.  I can relate.  Well, yes, you can.  They don't give handjobs before they do it, do they?  I don't like the way you almost said blowjobs, but edited it yourself.  If they get handjobs, it'd be cooler.  They don't give...  Don't give... 
[03:29:00]  Blan...  Well, there goes my funny last thing.  I got one in.  At the end of the show, you go, I got to get that one funny last thing in.  He wants his funny last thing.  You did very, very well.  Like your dad.  You have to do that with him.  Done good.  We learned that a long time ago, Bonnie.  I'm sure you're doing the same thing at home with Rich.  You did good.  You did all right.  Don't you think as a married couple, you should be able to get anal?  As a married couple? 
[03:29:30]  A married couple?  I'll give you anal.  Really?  No, I mean, I'll put something up your butt.  Ah, that's such a tease.  You know, maybe...  That's what he's looking for.  What do you think he wants?  Rich, maybe when the time is right.  You've only been married a little while.  You really want me to say, save some now, Amalek.  When I'm pregnant.  Oh, wow.  That's a good trade-off.  You guys were...  Anyway, the Assault on the Media Contest.  So the video's up, and a lot of people are checking it out. 
[03:30:00]  And we just added prizes, Anthony.  That's why I'm going here right now.  So Jägermeister has jumped on board as far as the Assault on the Media Contest goes.  Ah.  Jägermeister is providing the following prizes.  Jägermeister guitars?  Schecter guitars?  How do you say that?  Because I'm not a music guy.  Yeah, that's Schecter.  Schecter guitar?  Or Schecter guitars valued at $900 each.  Oh, my God.  So they're giving out more than one?  Is that the deal, Steve?  Yeah.  At least at...  Steve. 
[03:30:30]  Yes, sir.  Yes.  Yes, at least for the Lightroom tour.  How much do they value that, though?  Are they really not much money, or are they bullshit?  What, that?  You familiar with the Schecter guitar?  Are they giving one or many?  Many.  Many every month?  Oh, not many every month.  I'm sorry.  Like, for the month, that is...  So they're going to give out one guitar?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Jägermeister's going to give out a guitar every month.  $900 each is the value.  They're also giving out amps valued at $300. 
[03:31:00]  What happened?  He's going to kill you.  What happened?  I don't know.  I'm just assuming Jimmy's saying shit when I'm talking to a microphone.  So great when Steve doesn't have the headphones on.  I don't have headphones on, so I know he's just saying shit under his breath.  I see his right now.  I didn't say a word.  What does that say?  What's that?  A Jägermeister music tour disturbed cough and case guitar?  Shut up, Jimmy.  What the fuck?  See?  It wasn't me.  I got to give you some fucking... 
[03:31:30]  Basically, Jägermeister has come to the table big time.  You get a guitar and amp, some kind of, I don't know, guitar case.  And also passes to see Disturbed and meet the band.  Rock.  Oh, nice.  That's very, very cool.  Come on.  That's huge.  Also, you get your MiFi.  You get the free subscription for your MiFi.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, is this going to now, like, if Paul wins?  What?  He's going to be our representative?  What?  To Disturbed?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Because I like those guys, and I would like to meet them someday and not have to have... 
[03:32:00]  Dude, I'm sure they're going to be in here soon.  As soon as they come through New York, they'll be here.  When?  I hope they plug in and just, you know, rock the joint.  Rock.  Where are they going to play?  Well, these cubicles are supposed to be gone.  Cubicle 3.  A year ago.  A half a year ago.  I don't know what's going on with the cubicles.  Come on, Eric.  Come on, Elo.  Move it forward like you're doing down there in Washington.  Move it forward.  Forward.  So you get the MiFi.  You get the free subscription for the MiFi for a year.  You get dinner with E-Rock. 
[03:32:30]  And, of course, admission to check out one of our shows live here in New York City.  So the prizes are getting a lot better.  And in the lead is No Filter, Paul, with this little ditty.  The video much better because, like Anne said, the reporter just gave up and had to walk off the set.  Now, once again, the musicians came here.  Open up the XMCA radio!  Open up the XMCA!  We had a problem there, and Stacey got out of the way.  So that was Stacey Sager reporting live from Midtown.  Vash, you just bailed. 
[03:33:00]  I didn't tell them there.  She walked away.  Yeah, walked away.  Just walked away.  Just walk away.  That horn is funny, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, the trumpet.  The trumpet playing.  You can kind of hear it.  And they were left there just jumping up and down.  I just don't understand you guys getting alcohol or beer involved with one of your contests again.  Well, it's Jägermeister.  It's Jäger.  Who's looking?  It's black gold.  Drink responsibly.  When I think Jägermeister, I think guitar is an amplifier.  Yep.  That's right.  It's true.  You be nice to Jägermeister. 
[03:33:30]  It's because they're sponsoring a huge tour.  Oh, they are?  And it's tasty, too.  There's the tie-in.  Is Jägermeister beer or liquor?  What?  No answer.  Are you insane?  I haven't drank in 20 years.  I don't care.  You've been on Earth.  The planet Earth.  So is it beer?  Were you backstage at the Halloween party?  Yeah.  Did you see the trays of Jägermeister?  Yeah, but what is that?  And the girl was walking around with a t-shirt that said Jägermeister, just in case you might  have been a little confused.  They had Jägermeister.  What was on the tray, Rich? 
[03:34:00]  Those days?  Is it beer or liquor?  Oh, yeah.  They do little shots of beer.  Yeah.  You've seen that happen.  That's getting crazy, doing a tiny little shot of beer.  Whoa.  I've had enough.  I've had two.  Yeah.  Anthony admitted he did three.  Whoa.  Wait.  Holy crap, Rich.  Well, ask me if I know about crack.  I don't know.  Can't you problem solve it all in your head?  Good way to put it.  Can't you problem solve it?  Like, even if you don't know what Jägermeister is, can't you just, like, look around and go, 
[03:34:30]  okay, hmm, there's liquid in little, little cups.  She's wearing a Jägermeister shirt.  She's asking, would anyone like a shot?  Yeah.  I shot a beer?  And you still think it might be beer.  Beer.  In one big bottle that's, like, poured into shot glasses.  It's very expensive beer.  I've got to admit, sometimes I am dumb.  You need to sometimes just be silent and wait for more information to come to you before  you start speaking.  Your process, there's something flawed in the process.  You take, like, when you see things and the way you'll put it together and go, this 
[03:35:00]  is what that is.  Right, yeah.  You just look at them as, like, different separate parts and you can't put them together.  You're dumb.  You'll be like, alcohol, small thing.  Beer.  It's just amazing sometimes.  All right.  People are suggesting.  You ever see a guy drink a six-pack of vodka?  That's always fun.  You should hear when he's, like, emailing, he'll argue with people on the message boards 
[03:35:30]  or whatever.  But he's kind of like, how do you spell unintelligent?  Did you do that, Rich?  He just constantly asks me to spell stuff.  How do you spell ridiculous?  Why do you do that to yourself?  I tried once defending myself on Whackbag, I don't know, years ago, and I gave up.  I'm like, all right, they're going to do what they do, and that's that.  Well, no, it's just, you know, you get bored sometimes. 
[03:36:00]  You want to, you know, now I'm fighting them on MySpace.  I'm fighting them on all the boards.  On MySpace?  MySpace sucks.  I have a MySpace, and I can't get back into it because it, like, won't recognize my password  again.  Maybe you forgot your password.  No, not at all.  Maybe the space has roaches in it.  No.  Second time that's happened on MySpace.  Stinks.  It's God telling you to get a life.  No, it's Little Jimmy, MySpace, Little Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  It was mine.  That guy sold that for $500 million, that thing, that website. 
[03:36:30]  Why don't we play, what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show, to wrap this up?  Sure.  Someone's suggesting for attacks on the media, assault on the media, that, you know how the  sign is a problem, walking up?  Someone had a good idea.  One of those huge umbrellas, and you put it on the umbrella, and then you could walk with  it, maybe even like a little cane, and then at the right time, you open the umbrella, and  there it is.  Opie and Anthony.  What if it's a sunny day?  It doesn't matter.  They won't be, they won't, you're in New York City, it's a sunny day, and a guy's carrying 
[03:37:00]  an umbrella.  Hmm.  That's suspicious.  I don't think the press is worried about people carrying umbrellas on sunny days.  They're worried about people carrying huge Opie and Anthony signs.  Yeah.  All right.  That's just throwing it out there.  Good idea.  Those guys are just running with that bit.  Yeah.  It's getting huge again.  Good.  For a while there, we thought the bit was dead, but not anymore.  No.  Thanks to No Filter Paul.  No Filter Paul.  Sonny Ferrelli, and the Boston Strangler, and Buffalo Paul. 
[03:37:30]  The View comes on in five minutes.  Ooh.  Oh my God.  You watch The View every day?  No.  Actually, I watched it, our friend Joy Behar's on it.  She's a potty mouth, by the way.  Why?  Because you guys, I met her once, it was at the Dennis Leary roast, I couldn't believe  all the F's coming out of her.  Yeah, she's funny.  She doesn't come across that way in The View.  She's a dirty, dirty girl.  By the way, I'll be on Comedy Central tonight on Geraldo's show.  Oh, you will?  What time is that at?  It's a five-minute interview. 
[03:38:00]  I have no idea.  Okay.  Great Friday night videos with Greg Geraldo.  And Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane will be at Bananas in Hasbrok Heights all this weekend.  They're giving out little prize packs out there?  What are they giving them?  I don't know, little things.  XM bags?  What kind of shit do they throw in that?  What kind of crap could possibly be in there?  Our own Nathaniel has to plug something.  Van?  Yeah, he wants to use the good mic.  I'll be at the Village Lantern.  Because I'm a huge draw, I'm going to plug my gig at the...  Open Lantern on XM Saturday Radio. 
[03:38:30]  Whoa.  And, yeah.  Am I getting assaulted?  No, you're good, you're good.  Tonight at the Cellar, 7 o'clock, new talent show I'm hosting, and that's going to be great.  What show?

[03:39:30]  Ant, what did you learn?  I learned that trannies love buying hybrids, but love being picked up in Saturn's morph.  That was hurtful, sir.  Yeah.  People are commenting that Voss said Jaeger Monster.  Yeah.  Yeah, Rich's instant feedbacks are just coming in.  Jaeger Monster.  I'm just, I throw these out there because it makes, looking at the Photoshop, so much more  entertaining later this evening.  I can't wait to see you as an Oompa Loompa.  Jaeger Monster.

And someone's saying, next time you want to spell ridiculous, it's V-O-S.  With that, we want to thank Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane for helping us out today.  You guys were great.
