<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, dramatically describing their illnesses, humorously blaming a party at "FH Riley's" for a widespread "FH Riley's Plague."  They detailed their symptoms, discussed listener calls about the flu, a "sick host" contest, and their personal hygiene habits, with Opie's tissue-tossing technique receiving special attention.  The conversation then shifted to a detailed analysis of Martin Scorsese's "The King of Comedy," focusing on specific scenes and character portrayals.  This transitioned into a discussion of male versus female greetings and a shocking voicemail from a mother whose 15-year-old daughter justified risky sexual behavior by referencing Barack Obama's presidency. The hosts reacted with humorous disbelief.  The segment concluded with anecdotes about their childhoods and relationships with their fathers, a montage of disturbing rectal temperature-taking images, and a discussion of EasyPass and their desire to "fall off the grid."  The mention of Patrice O'Neal as a later guest foreshadowed his appearance.


Patrice O'Neal joined the show as a guest.  A caller shared his experiences with credit, contrasting his past irresponsible borrowing ("white man's credit") with his current responsible financial behavior. This led to a discussion about the mayor of Los Alamitos, California, resigning after sending a racially insensitive email. The hosts and callers debated the event, touching on racial stereotypes and "snitching," extending the conversation to hypocrisy among athletes and others.  Anthony discussed his hair transplant, detailing the process and cost, while updates on "fattyrock.com" and listener "F.U." messages were also included.  O'Neal promoted his upcoming "off the grid" tour.


The show continued with a discussion about inexpensive wedding dresses and a news report detailing injuries sustained at a Filene's Basement "Running of the Brides" sale, including a woman lying motionless.  The hosts discussed the dangers of Black Friday sales and the lack of legal repercussions for stores.  Audio clips and video footage from the event were played, highlighting injuries and chaotic behavior.  The conversation shifted to Paul Stanley's hairpiece, and a piece of his artwork, both criticized with ridicule and humorous comparisons. A further update on the "Running of the Brides" sale was followed by a video of a large woman falling through a cash register trap door.  The hosts then discussed Patrice O'Neal's health and upcoming appearances before engaging in a heated debate with him about gun ownership, crime statistics, and racial disparities.  The conversation included significant racial slurs and stereotypes from both sides.  The segment concluded with a childhood anecdote from O'Neal, a mention of an upcoming interview with porn star Gina Lynn, and a debunked fact about Jack Johnson inventing the monkey wrench.


The show then transitioned into a discussion of race relations and personal experiences with racism, featuring a story from Patrice O'Neal about a racial slur and subsequent fight.  The conversation touched upon white supremacist websites and their views on Jews and Black people, before shifting to the economic situation and blaming the Bush administration for the financial crisis.  Gina Lynn, along with other guests, joined the show, leading to an explicit conversation about the porn industry.  The discussion included racial preferences in pornography, personalities of porn stars, detailed accounts of sexual acts, and behind-the-scenes anecdotes.  Several porn stars were mentioned by name: Shauna Linnae, Lexington Steel, Justin Slayer, Wesley Pipes, Ginger Lynn, and Jules Jordan.  A first-time porn actress, April, was briefly interviewed.  The conversation continued to encompass jealousy in relationships within the porn industry, including accounts of infidelity and a story about Travis, Gina Lynn's husband, masturbating to a picture of a co-worker.  A difficult shoot with a performer with ass implants was also discussed.  The segment concluded with promotion of a boxing match and upcoming comedy club appearances, along with a short segment of the "Dave and Bobo Show" discussing an English reality TV personality who wanted to televise her death.


The final segment began with a discussion about a woman's plan to broadcast her death live on television, with skepticism expressed by the hosts and a caller named Tom.  The conversation moved to other potentially shocking television content, including a woman beating her boyfriend.  The hosts interacted with callers, marked by interruptions, insults, and arguments, with one caller hanging up.  Bobo, in-studio, discussed his New York Mets fandom.  Gina Lynn and two models arrived, with Gina Lynn promoting her clothing line, Skinpa.com.  The segment culminated in an explicit scene where, at Bobo's direction (though heavily prompted and directed by the hosts), the models undressed and engaged in various sexual acts with Bobo, including breast-rubbing and spanking.  The hosts provided a running commentary, escalating the explicit nature.  The show concluded with the hosts reflecting on the events and branding it "The David and Bobo Show."

[00:06:00]  comfy no i wasn't researching biological warfare and effed up probably sticking probably were  my firearms who knows what's going on in that basement yeah i know there's a movie theater in  there but i saw other rooms that were very suspicious i was uh i was trying and it sucks  i was i felt so crappy and i was enjoying the hell out of the king of comedy last night oh and i had i  had to stop it and go to bed because i just i felt so crappy but i saw enough of it where it's like i 
[00:06:30]  just now i know why i remember why i just love this movie yeah just yelling and that's scorsese's  mother talking down the stairs i don't know and you know what it once you settle down from good  oh yeah that's her but what are you doing down there i gotta do this now now jerry here's how i picture  jerry the music starts when he makes his tape yeah it's so cringe inducing my favorite scene is 
[00:07:00]  actually when he goes out to the hamptons oh yeah yeah and that chick is just hoping that she's  finally getting like a break in her life and she realizes that she's still a zero but she still has  some some form of class and she's apologizing all the way out the door and rupert's just like  uh jerry you know she doesn't understand people like us right right right and then the asian guy  are you giving me a a heart attack over here he's giving me a heart attack over here he won't  leave he give me a heart attack over here he's touching everything yeah or something like that 
[00:07:30]  and then jerry comes to the door and just gives him because he he actually rupert pumpkin had this  delusion that jerry invited him to his house yeah so he had bags and everything and he's like all  right jerry we'll get to work on this right away because he had this fantasy that jerry told him his  his comedy was genius and he wants rupert to come over his house so he could find out and learn how  how rupert does it because he's such a comedy genius so he's like i got the work right here we'll get 
[00:08:00]  started and then he goes i can have you arrested he goes jerry's great isn't he look at him look at  him how about you we do a skit where you invite people over and have everyone arrested  laughing and you're just douche chilling out it's so cringy it's so great too my favorite part  of that movie was de niro's fantasies are all so they're so believable oh yeah like when he goes  uh uh can you take over for me can you can you do the show goes on what are you what are you doing 
[00:08:30]  to me oh you want the tears to come out of my eyes six weeks i don't have six weeks and then they're  laughing together when he agrees to it it's like all right you got me oh it's just delusion well  my favorite is the apology like this showed you like who rupert was when his teacher is like  apologizing yeah yeah rupert we realized we were wrong and you were right it was fantastic no i don't 
[00:09:00]  like it's such a good movie no i don't like in the movie anymore is sender bernhardt oh no nope i used  to love her in the movie but the more i see it i'm like wow she just takes away from the brilliance of  uh de niro in that movie man yeah because jerry even jerry lewis isn't that great in the movie he's  just playing a basic part it's it's all de niro yeah it really is just all when robert de niro's  character when the security tells him to leave and i'll explain on the way out what you're doing  because he keeps going into jerry langford's uh studios trying to get to a meeting with jerry 
[00:09:30]  and then they they have him removed and then sandra bernhardt says no he's in there and they say he  goes uh de niro goes no they told me he wasn't in there he goes i saw she goes i saw him walk in  and when you see him shut his briefcase and walk back in there you're just like oh my god this is  not going to end well and security just chases him and bodily throws him out he's like i did not get  thrown out they they escorted me out of the building i was i was shown out of the building i was not  thrown out it's delusional a great movie it's a brilliant movie right after raging bull they did that 
[00:10:00]  oh really yeah right after a nice twist for him odd choice after raging bull to do that i saw a couple  of uh movies last night where uh there there's a guy in the background when rupert pupkin is having  dinner with that girl that he uh saw at the bar right right and behind him some guy is making faces  like so the girl can see rupus is babbling about something and the girl can see like this older guy  sitting at a table making faces like he's goofing on rupert and i looked and went oh my god it's 
[00:10:30]  maury from maury's wigs oh really yeah it was maury oh that's classic because i mean scorsese  movies people just showing up yeah sure doing scorsese a little favor people right it's 10 years  earlier i think i think i'm gonna i'm guessing king of comedy was 82 and then i gotta remember the  movie but as somebody it was it wasn't king of comedy it was something else or it might have been  king of comedy somebody's walking out the door in slow motion and it might have been jerry 
[00:11:00]  and uh what's uh what's her name that played scarface's sister with the big afro head uh  rosalini is it no or yeah whatever anna maria we all see the face as you say i don't know her name  tony you want to be tony uh she's just standing there she has a part that has to be one second  long and she's got that same horrible goddamn sam hair  yeah great great movie though best cameo master antonio what's her name that's her name the last

[00:19:00]  trianna admits to having sex with 10 people boys and girls oh no way no she didn't  and is the is is the camera on her backstage as she's like swiveling her hips right in an unsexy  you don't even know how to do this yet fashion this is leading somewhere by the way it's not just a  basic mori club trust me but uh why is why are people still in shock that that girls especially 
[00:19:30]  in high school yeah are having sex with other girls at this point yeah it is a it's pretty much  an epidemic yeah why the the over-the-top reaction to that i've heard stories from people that i know  um uh about like daughters yeah and having you know relations with other girls in junior high  things like that become the thing to do yeah and we tried this maybe we could try it again 
[00:20:00]  i asked you this question if this is a new phenomenon anthony or have the women always  been doing this but now it's accepted so now like these uh these little high school girls can walk  around and and kind of shock people a little bit by holding hands and kissing their girlfriends and  stuff or was this always happening so we need like some of the some of the old broads you know what i  the the old the old broads to call and uh tell us if uh if this was happening when they were growing up  i think you're always going to find people that were doing this but i think now it happens a lot more 
[00:20:30]  and i'll equate it with um guys doing a lot more touching when they meet each other  i'm not talking about kissing okay or anything like that but uh there used to be the basic handshake  then there was the jive handshake where you would kind of do the hey homie with that little jive  handshake and then it turned into like the the the bump the bro bump thing chest bump thing where  you'd grab each other's hand and kind of like hey what was that called the are you saying 
[00:21:00]  we're all the elbro no they call it the uh the uh the the chug right the chug the the yeah right  the shug the shug the shaking hug are you trying to say we're all warming up to some homosexual  activity and now there's this thing where guys are actually doing the shug right and then doing that  european kind of hell no on the side of the neck not touching the lips to the neck but kind of like  doing that thing and then there's this other thing where your pants are down and you just run at 
[00:21:30]  another man uh from behind and uh you know let the chips fall where they may so we're slowly but surely  working toward a little uh uh you know geese we're working toward the geese we're just taking our time  unlike these uh women in high school yeah they're all in yeah the guy's slowly warming up to them you  kind of make a good point because it went from like like a little handshake a little little fist bump but  now it's like in junior high you're pretty much hugging men have hugged your friend oh my god  you would be called out in a second my friend frank hurt his leg one time and i felt weird oh yeah 
[00:22:00]  frank yeah yeah oh frank was better a weird massaging his upper leg no no no don't fly straight even  though he sprained his ankle what happened frank you know i was pinning his legs behind his ears  no i i felt weird we were playing whatever in the street and frank hurt his leg i had to walk him  back up to his house and it felt weird letting him put his arm around my shoulder to walk myself  up it just felt like we were a couple of a couple of sissy mary pantywaists in the middle of the street 
[00:22:30]  you just didn't do it and now i see you know people uh uh young guys hook meeting up with each other  and then it's you know it's the shug yeah we're doing that everyone's doing the shug i haven't done  the kiss thing though at this air kiss with the shug that's more of a family that's a family thing oh well  family like like and and it's very it's very uh wop because you know when sal comes over it's the  hug and the little kiss thing my uncle tony the same thing you know sort of a uh eye trallion thing

[00:43:30]  it was pretty much a full-time job and uh yeah that was uh you think that left a scar that was a big  place in your soul richard nixon used to go there all the time because it was very close to the western  white white house of san clemente so he would go there and they'd bring out the presidential pewter  plates and everything we'd we'd have to wash them and nixon would come in i never saw him there or  anything but you know you washed nixon's plate i washed nixon's plate you washed it i washed him  perhaps you need to wash the plates i could tote them for you my back don't give me that you 
[00:44:00]  washed his plate i washed his plates and i i worked at the uh el adobe restaurant in san juan capistro  and uh i had to give yeah 20 of my income to my father which promptly went to i think tall  boy budweiser's and um right horse feed hey we're getting oh good one jimmy we're getting to the  bottom of the uh rectal thermometers there's a reason bottom of the record oh you're a punster 
[00:44:30]  is it because am i ready for uh an open mic or what i think all right oh yeah tonight's our  listener con are uh we're all going to be there at comics uh comics uh uh tonight look it up online  whatever we're too busy it's in the meatpacking district it's on ninth avenue and 14th street  just call it the hot zone when i'm there because i'm going to infect every listener oh great that'll  get the people there thanks you know people come up to me and and they like i know you don't like  shaking hands i'm going to be that most handshakenest idiot i'm just going to go up to everybody hey how 
[00:45:00]  you doing pat him on the back give him the kiss danny has found a montage of picks that are just  deeply disturbing oh the everybody and everything getting uh their temperature uh taken the old  fashioned way oh wow wow that one's okay that's a little hot though that one that girl is um there's  no need to remove all the clothing she's very concerned about her fever perhaps she's trying to cool  down right so she's got no clothes on she's having her temperature taken well that's what you got to 
[00:45:30]  do when your temperature gets over 100 and but the way she's having to take it she could also recite  the preamble to the well of course she so you know that's where it's going she feels better with  the female doctor that's good she's on her back with her legs way up in the air because i think  what happens is it keeps the blood even inside the body when you're nude and the legs are your feet  up by the ceiling it kind of allows your temperature to be taken uh you know with somebody running at  you first sure oh dr jimmy it's a cold and old bobby joke come on mom run at me with it with the 
[00:46:00]  thermometer i don't want to leave his jokes is it running he's like he's to like it take it like  that come on mom run at me with it that is really funny yeah let me say hi to charlie in staten island  charlie charlie good morning hello charlie the way that they um give rectal thermometer exams it  starts when you're a baby because you can't put a glass tube into a baby's mouth oh uncle paul  break it uh and chew it and break it what with the little gums all right that's oh yeah how about 
[00:46:30]  that's all well and good but why the eight-year-olds and the ten-year-olds still getting it done that  way i think they understand that they shouldn't be biting down on the thermometer and how about  a sick parents out there poking their kids with thermometers in the wrong place it's 2009 they got  something you just laser their forehead with and it tells the temperature immediately no yes no yes  that's crazy no it is you you hit you you point like a thing at their head right and you pull the 
[00:47:00]  little trigger and you don't have to worry if he's got a fever anymore that's right now and uh it reads  the temperature off of their forehead without any contact whatsoever it's amazing that will eventually  translate into you can walk into a building and as you walk into a building uh your temperature and  your health status will be read instantly and that will prevent disease and uh spreading sick if  you're sick they will let you in trap door opens up and drops you like the spartans did their little  babies well no you'll just have to walk to the right yeah and receive your your health zap oh and 
[00:47:30]  then you'll be able to i'm telling you we will eradicate all disease sooner or later and then the  only thing that will kill us will be uh when our bodies run out let's say hi does the caco tell you  that no i just thought of that okay it's kind of i'll talk to i'll talk to caco when i see  when you know that it's a fun thing to think of still that to think about uh let's go to uh  dave in philly before we take a break i tinker with these medical machines bill cox's outfit  cdc's outfit david go ahead hey how's it going fellas hey i'm good i know anthony have you ever

[01:10:30]  from ron and fez i was listening on the way out to long island yesterday and they had this watermelon  story that just blew me away uh and ronnie was getting into it and made some great great points like  we all get that joke in our email and then we decide that oh god this is this makes me laugh so hard i  gotta send it to everybody i know because they're gonna laugh just as hard oh they're gonna love it  but you don't you don't really think about who you're sending it to you don't think it out especially  your position right right in uh the community right and uh you could get in a little bit of trouble 
[01:11:00]  yeah uh make sure you listen to ron and fez today they'll certainly have an update on the story we got  it now but uh they'll do their own take on the thing but uh here's how it went down well the mayor of  los alamitos announced tonight that he is stepping down over a personal email that he sent who many are  calling racist and offensive mayor dean gross spent several people an image showing a watermelon  patch on the front lawn of the white house the subject line read no easter egg hunt this year  tonight gross says he's sorry and realizes the controversy will affect his ability to lead the 
[01:11:30]  city of 12 000 he plans to step down at the council meeting on monday how stupid are you why would he send  that out as the mayor in this day and age you know anything like that is going to get you thrown out of  office your job whatever it's a stupid thing to do but to have to step down over a joke it's not  even like vicious it's like just he didn't make it he was just forwarding just a country of it's out  there who doesn't like that heineken guy from katrina come on we've all seen him walking around 
[01:12:00]  it's a tough one man it's not a vicious intention no it's a tough one meaning it's just i'm i'm in  in between of my loyalty to to race and loyalty to not scenarios like you know what it is just  stops stop telling on people his position little uh hall monitors you you you look like you're going  to give favoritism to one group of people over another because of your insensitivity to one group 
[01:12:30]  of people if you're a public official that's the problem with that if that was just some uh guy or  shock jock or something like that then he shouldn't you know then it should just be whatever  it is but that guy's like an elected government official and it kind of it kind of makes it like  well he's if he if he finds this funny that's that's implying that government officials are better  than us in terms of uh what they're supposed in theory they're supposed to be but a lot of them 
[01:13:00]  are just local yokels they are i mean what you call is the mayor i mean old rusty clinics was the  mayor of some ridiculous town i mean it's just carmel and and somehow swarzenegger's the government  of california i i still don't have respect for california for that happening it's a ridiculous  thing so if he like this movie he's he but that's what i'm saying all of a sudden he's in charge of uh  you know economy yeah all of a sudden what was his background so if he did some old racial stuff 
[01:13:30]  it's like i might go he's supposed to but he did you know he's a jackass he he had some um uh anti-jewish  statements in his past of course his father has some weird ties with some uh maybe the national  socialist uh parties and it's it's like and i understand look look at this picture it's funny  it's not it's not hateful it's so nice and green but i don't feel like the guy's stepping down but i  know i do go wow these snitches like yeah i know everyone's got a rat out oh my god i don't 
[01:14:00]  understand why a rod is the poster child for f a rod for roys though i don't understand why he is  because because he just is not like snitches just and i don't mean like don't snitch but it's like  i'm a fan of the steroid trust me i delete a lot i delete a lot of i've never done steroids  on my facebook i'm a fan of their existence yes i don't give a crap what these guys are on to make  this sport it's an exhibition sport i don't give a crap it's an exhibition but the children shut up  and parent your kids it's just i want to see 600 foot monster home runs exactly and it's just like 
[01:14:30]  someone from 1980s snitching or someone else who did coke yeah like even if i didn't do coke it's  like am i getting ready to snitch on you about well yeah you know cocaine abuse speaking of snitching  with the steroid thing kurt shilling is the big snitch up there in boston he demands a list of players  that were on steroids it's it's brave to come out now but you were playing and you were playing  during the steroid era and you knew this was going on so why don't you speak up then when it wasn't 
[01:15:00]  popular to talk about steroids thank you very much i'm right i can't stand people who are now it's  brave when it's the right time exactly that's why i will say something if this is off the subject maybe  but uh you know what a very underrepresented group in this country that for the hit historically  good white people good white people meaning great white people who were 
[01:15:30]  fighters when it wasn't acceptable to uh like black people were not liking black people you mean the  white people that was right link arms and sing we will overcome they're not represented though i don't  they're faceless they there's no real history of here's um jim smith the guy who did this in 1910  for me to have something there's no white schindler's list guy where at least you know 
[01:16:00]  schindler was helped out some jews how about abraham lincoln nah nah nah nah wasn't him i know he really  and he's like the oj of yeah of doing good things for black people i i mean just the average like  where you know where there's an average white guy average white citizens where it wasn't  acceptable now uh-huh it's acceptable now to be um sorry what i'm sorry no i i have to drop i'm 
[01:16:30]  really sorry i'm just what happened i just saw this this girl for the abino this is where our minds go  sometimes sorry i i messed you up really bad no it's cool i'm just i'm just saying that was supposed  to stay in my head i'm looking for that that person that those a group of people right where it  was like it's not just like because now it's easy to be a good person it's easy to vote for the black 
[01:17:00]  president i'm gonna see somebody that might have voted for the black president in 1930 you're not  gonna just meet him see him hear about him do you feel what i'm saying i didn't i i hear what you  it would help i think i think it would help relations if black people knew that there was a  a decent white person walking around the streets before you were forced to be well i think there is  uh but they just don't don't make a big deal out of it they know them i i approach black people all  the time and talk about it yeah now you know i'm just saying i think that was i think that's an 
[01:17:30]  underrepresented group i mean i'll just say it unsolicited on a subway i'll shake a black man's hand  i don't like you 50 years ago i'm just saying it might help let's go to matt in ohio he's got an  explanation for this uh watermelon joke go ahead matt matt yeah let's go i am matt yeah hey buddy  uh my big problem with this guy is his explanation was that he was not aware that there was a  stereotype connection between african-americans and watermelon he did not say that wow that's a 
[01:18:00]  lame ass excuse you should have stepped out like our bud dwyer all right come on that's  a pretty lame excuse white people come up with some pretty lame excuses though when they're in  trouble oh yeah they really do you like and then yeah then you come up with something real quick  and go wow that was stupid that didn't sound real we got an update on the story here and police are  guarding the mayor of los alamitos california against flying watermelons he sent what could be a racist 
[01:18:30]  email showing the white house lawn covered in the fruit the caption no easter egg hunt this year  the mayor says he was unaware of the racial stereotype that black people like watermelon so now they're  walking around throwing watermelons at this guy yeah you hear the reporter she sort of kind of had a  little uh she was ready to chuckle over the joke yeah so now he's sending a new one with just giant  black all over the front lawn because he's not aware of that stereotype either 
[01:19:00]  a bunch of uh tables and restaurants with no tips left on them yeah why are all these kfc buckets i  just assumed yeah that's the lamest ass excuse i've ever heard the worst one i've ever heard that's  probably the one stereotype that is the oldest and most well-known uh uh stereotype aside from you know the  big junk the watermelon thing it's like doesn't bother me no why would it bother you you like  watermelon i love watermelon eat all the time i hate watermelon why don't because you're white 
[01:19:30]  no i'm civilian so i like a little watermelon what is it is it it's it's too watery that's why  you don't feel like you're eating anything that's why it's good why they don't call it melba toast melon  uh uh let's go to tony tony tony wants to defend kirk shillian go ahead tony  obi i've been wanting to just explain it to you for a long time sure i agree with you from the 
[01:20:00]  perspective that it shouldn't matter from the fans i'm off for the big home runs too sure from the  players perspective they're competing with these other players for contracts for salaries for how long  their career is going to last and if you if some guys are juiced up and some guys are not  then it's really unfair just from a player's perspective and he should have spoke up dude  oh well tim ponsock did fine jimmy uh stop it jimmy just said exactly what i was thinking then why  isn't he speaking up when it really mattered when he knew these guys were taking needles in the butt 
[01:20:30]  from their fellow players he's a hero now he didn't want to be unpopular with his teammates for being a  rat right it's it's it's right now it's acceptable to do the right thing in baseball right where were  you when it was when it was doing the right thing was the wrong thing right where were you when it  would have been a brave thing to to come out and go you know they would have treated you like crap in  the clubhouse that's why you didn't do it they would have treated them like serpical yeah yeah i'm gonna  tell you why did roger clemens and mcnamara go in the bathroom stall to shoot up because it wasn't 
[01:21:00]  as obvious as what y'all are right now because it's embarrassing but your butt cheeks out of  somebody's a dude is stabbing you in the butt cheeks with a with a needle tony i never spent a day in the  clubhouse but you really think that this was like that people really didn't know i'm gonna do an  investigation i bet you babe ruth and hank aaron did something of course they did yeah  if you were competing for a radio job with somebody that was able to take a 
[01:21:30]  a pill and enable them to not be hackish and to be able to put on good radio  you weren't allowed to take that without getting in trouble for it it's called coffee xanax that is  the dumbest analogy i've ever heard in my life it really is take a pill that makes you better on the  radio it's called liquor yeah yeah let's see anthony do a show without liquor well in the old days  now i just have all right tony i mean it was just accepted man i don't i just thanks tony 
[01:22:00]  let's just move on from it now because everybody did it now everybody doesn't do it so let's just  keep it moving now yeah yeah screw it whoever i bet i guarantee bay what was it prohibition bay  roof plate i'm guarantee he had a couple of sips that helped his help something illegal loosened  them up a little bit at the plate will you stop a couple of drinks at a speed gatorade is supposed to  help your body do something better right like stop right i'm sick of the morality in baseball  whereas you know back in the good old days what when dimaggio was belting maryland in the face 
[01:22:30]  ty cobb yeah i'm sure she was not deserving of it but and we did the ty cobb break he was a naughty  boy terrible guy naughty naughty boy who cares i don't care at all i don't i don't look up to any  of these sports guys i i have my teams and i like watching that's it gambling is the only thing they  should like make real sure of because that could affect sure like you throw in the game you can't  gamble but unless you have a mongoloid haircut you should be allowed yeah oh pete i think you should  be allowed allowed to gamble on yourself not that gamble that your team will win that's not why i'll 
[01:23:00]  tell you why that makes a difference with why i've heard from that even for managers and stuff because in  order to win you may make decisions that are bad for a player or the team in the long run just to win  that game like the bottom line just winning the game now but if you have a guy that like you see  his car see your pictures doing well in six innings and you know his shoulders a little bit sore right  you might just say you know what yank him because we need him for the rest of the season it's not  worth it just to win this game but if you got 50 000 right on the game you might go effort leave 
[01:23:30]  him in let him get to the eighth inning like you may just manage the team slightly differently i'm  suspicious of the coaches and the managers these mother efforts you know not covering the spread  they know what they know what's going on there with the betting next thing you know  next thing you know that they're taking out all their star players and now they're not  covering the effing spread and people losing a lot of money that's true maybe the coaches and  managers got a little action on the game mother effers cost us a lot of cash out there over the  years that is true if they're able to like ring that score up by keeping their star players in 
[01:24:00]  or if they pull them out well it's more a covering of the spread where the team still wins they  don't yeah yeah spread because they don't cover the spread uh the coach decides he's going to take  out right players that's what i mean and and why isn't anyone looking into that crap because i bet  you there's something going on there are you kidding me that's a legitimate way of altering uh  people's winnings major if they're uh yeah betting on a game big time over unders things 
[01:24:30]  you hear about the nba patrice i know you're a hoops uh fan right i just heard about it 175 mil  175 mil uh be loaned to the nba to save teams you don't watch teams don't say they're not saying  the teams how about don't save them if people aren't supporting them how about that that's  natural selection honestly most of these leagues are overextended so maybe it's maybe it's time to  you know knock out a few and i don't mind it it's arrogance anyway arrogant it gets with us  coming to arrogance over it it just i think it should this thing is insane where is this money coming 
[01:25:00]  from for god's sake you i know yeah you you too is it yeah i bet it is a little better look at  your w-2 form a little bit paying i bet you're that's why i don't want to go to california work  they take your money when you if you work in cali they take your money now yep they don't wait for  you to file taxes they want your cash now we can get into that because that's gonna be a whole  discussion i just want to wrap up the sports thing because we got glenn and jersey going with what  patrice said patrice said glenn go ahead yeah how you doing um willie mays used to drink a six 
[01:25:30]  pack of coca-cola when it had cocaine in it before each game do you understand how long ago coca-cola  had coke in it and how short a period of time it had coke in it he wasn't even born when coca-cola had  coke in it you know how it's coke you'd have to drink to actually get the effect of snorting 
[01:26:00]  i want an investigation on those old players and see what was around travis  your mind travis is good to research opium can you find out if will be made you know if anyone did it  was babe ruth because the other teams would have 11 home runs and fat boy had 60. yeah what was  babe ruth doing come on man coca-cola had coke in it like 1890 or something yes it has nothing to  do with the coca-cola they took it out and did he buy it from like a dude that had a little cart  and a horse he called elixir elixir couple of retarded babies running around doing flips right next

[01:29:00]  of crap for it okay uh when mcguire was hitting all those home runs he uh shilling said hey i'm  afraid to pat my teammates on the butt because i'm afraid they'll scream when i hit the injection mark  oh boy is that why that's why he had to testify to congress not because he was uh using steroids  because of all the he sees one thing but seventy percent of his teammates were using steroids you  know i know kirk shilling uh plays everquest that online game does he uh not take potions for extra  strength when he's got to fight a huge mom i think he does i think he's taking energy potions and

[01:34:30]  oh it's still yeah yeah it's still being sewn in yeah no no it's still it's still growing  it's still what's growing could you stop lying to grow men no no i swear to you you're an  important figure in life man stop having people thinking they invent new ways to grow hair  they they they did this is what they do they take from the back of your head do you know that  you see people that are horseshoe bald they got just the hair around the sides of their head yeah  that yes yeah that's genetically engineered that hair will never fall out it doesn't go bald 
[01:35:00]  it does it's not susceptible to male pattern baldness so what they do is okay they take a big swath of  that it's called the harvest area they take the living the living thing that's the living thing back  there and then put it in the dead area they sew it back shut and then they take it and they die so  kind of like poltergeist when they build houses on top of graveyards right so you don't just  like it 
[01:35:30]  they don't just lay a strip of bacon on your head like that a hairy strip of bacon on your head  they dissect it and what they do and here's what the problem was in the old days they would take like  a hole cutter and and pop out these plugs that were about the size of pencil erasers then they'd pop  them in the person's head and it would look like barbie doll hair almost like cheap type of thing  yeah it would look awful now what they've done wait a minute i see i see uh stunt brain drifting off  you don't believe in this situation obviously look at his head oh jesus exactly you do you you 
[01:36:00]  haven't investigated this yeah he tried one but he opened the thing called radiation instead  oh jesus you haven't investigated this oh rubbing your foot against the rug um fuzz head balloon  you haven't investigated this no you just you're just letting it go natural you're not fighting it  like this i'm using something else rogaine yes sir the rogaine foam i i do believe i listen to the 
[01:36:30]  advertising is it working station it takes four months for your head to stop looking like an  under-off oh god damn oh damn oh jesus christ  i've finished your story follicle face all right so then they take this this uh big uh strip that they  took out and they dissect it into a strip yes yes so what so this is gone so now you have some 
[01:37:00]  baldness no no no they then they close up the area they close it up oh okay you won't even see there's  no you don't notice anything so where do you get the excess now what they do to to to show them  stretches that's what happens oh my god so what they do then is take here's the important part you're not  listening to here they take they take the separate hair follicles and dissect this thing into into one 
[01:37:30]  twos and threes so you have single hairs growing out of a follicle two hairs no more than three hairs  growing out of one following at when what point in the in the meeting did you understand it yourself  where you went i do it big guy studied everything cut the back of my face i saw before and afters i saw  everything i knew everything about this and they pull the back of the head back down and then when  they do that the next thing you know you got two little hairy things under your chin it's not that 
[01:38:00]  tight jimmy is adam's apples on your cheek now no your skin is very pliable and they dissect it and then  what they do is they pop these hairs these separate follicles individually in artistic fashion in the  same way your hair grew the same grain and everything and then they pop them in one at a  time i had three thousand five hundred put in and how long of a period it takes nine hours the procedure 
[01:38:30]  you're you're sitting asleep no you're watching movies you're you know doing things your head is  numbed out with novocaine saying ow a lot and and well no it just see that's plugs those are plugs  well that's your hair that is not what i've shut off that is nothing like what i have we no one knows  because you won't remove the hat i do too show show patrice i went to my christening i don't want to see 
[01:39:00]  it how much how about this show patrice i love it i don't want to see he's going off the grid  you're not going to see i'm not going to see it i don't want to see the big reveal i love anthony i  just don't want to see old spaghetti head it isn't it it is it really should have just put play-doh in  your mouth and just grinded it right through your stupid head  you 
[01:39:30]  the single follicles you use for the fun  i got three words for you super glue and wig  no wigs  are you hoping it doesn't work i pray to god i just don't i don't want to see the pre  I don't want to see it.  It looks like little fuzz.  It looks like little fuzzes on the back of my head.  When is this going to be finished?  Because they shaved it.  It takes four months to start growing, and then it takes like six months you start really noticing. 
[01:40:00]  It's like a year.  By a year, I had a hair.  You won't notice I had a white spot on the back of my head.  You said you can get cut and it'll continue to grow.  It's my own growing hair.  It's not a wig.  It's not anything else.  The only thing is you can't sneeze or tie your shoes.  It's Danny Fountain.  There's a Play-Doh.  There actually is a Play-Doh guy.  Play-Doh head.  Are you serious?  Okay, ready?  I don't know.  I'll answer any questions.  This is very important. 
[01:40:30]  Yes.  Because I think this is the most important.  Uh-huh.  How much?  Oh, damn.  That's the problem because health insurance is not covering it.  No, no.  This sounds like a rich man's world right here.  My, because I went for a lot of follicles because I wanted to hold back.  It wasn't like I was going completely bald, but I had like a light.  Oh, and they give you a per follicle.  It's a per follicle price for groupings.  So I went really big.  And it wound up.  3,500 follicles. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  So let's figure they sell it to even make it worth something.  Because I'm looking at StuntBrand.  It looks like he has 12.  Yeah.  He's going to have to rob a package again.  A fullhead.  Obama's stimulus package didn't fix that.  Oh, man.  So let's figure 1,000 follicles is the only way to go.  What's the average?  It must have some kind of an average. 
[01:41:30]  It's got to be a minimum.  It really all depends.  Could you go in there and go, I just want four?  You have people that just had a touch-up.  Like there are people that just have the receding hairline in the front, and they are fine,  but they don't like a receding.  They only need maybe 1,000, 500 popped in the corner.  What's the minimum follicles usually?  Two.  Could be, yeah, probably 1,000, I would say.  So you didn't really go crazy.  You only got 3,500.  That's a lot.  But I'm saying if 1,000 is the main, is like the usual, so how much is 1,000 follicles?  I don't know, because I pay for 3,500. 
[01:42:00]  What do you think the maximum is?  $10,000.  You know, women with flat breasts, they pay about that.  They are, right?  They pay about that to do what they have to do.  And you know what?  When you say women with fat breasts, I just wanted to say you should be shocked.  I did.  So about 3,500 follicles for 10 Gs to feel good. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, so I don't have to wait.  You know what it was?  Because if you do feel better, you're going to feel better, because I know that's just...  It was a thing where I noticed from when we went on Letterman and Leno and stuff, you  walk out, and then you watch, and I just noticed, like, when the camera was a certain  way, you just see, like, a white spot.  And I'm like, I just want the white spot gone on the back of my hair.  A Hindu old lady's hair.  Yeah, yeah.  Looking like a monk.  She just got some spray paint.  Yeah.  No, I'm not going to do the spray paint.  I'm not going to do a wig. 
[01:43:00]  I wasn't going to do anything.  I wanted my own growing hair that I don't have to worry about.  Take a yarmulke and go to a barber shop and just put glue on it and get some hair and  then wear it.  There you go.  That would look silly.  And so you're not doing this stunt because of the money.  Yeah.  Because it's 10 Gs to...  Yeah.  It's not even that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  It wasn't that bad.  Yeah.  For like a week.  But they give you, you know, some good pills and stuff.  So what is pain like that?  Well, it's not that bad.  No.  It's...  A percocet pain? 
[01:43:30]  Vicodin pain?  A little Vicodin.  Yeah.  Wow.  Good stuff.  Vicodin.  It's worth it, though.  I still have Vicodin, though, left from it.  I still have Vicodin left.  I didn't even take them all.  But then there's a thing where, you know, I had to wear that do-rag on my head for a few  days because they come with the hat on.  But within a week, you couldn't even see that anything was done except there were little  nubs of hair, like where there weren't here and here.  Yeah.  He showed us early on.  He refused to show us now because I think it's a disaster. 
[01:44:00]  He doesn't want to show anybody.  I'm just kidding.  It's got to be a disaster.  Let me see your head, Sonic the Hedgehog.  Come on.  Here's the problem.  Let's Patrice take a pic.  I don't want to see.  You don't want to see?  I don't want to see.  He's not going to let us see.  I know that much.  Let me explain, here's absolutely the problem.  I've not gotten a haircut since probably before Thanksgiving.  That's why I got mullet happening under my hat over here.  And I shower the night before so I don't have to shower in the morning. 
[01:44:30]  So when I sleep, I wake up with hair like Medusa.  I got snakes growing out of my head.  I got like wild, frizzy hair when it's not cut.  So when I put my hat on, now I have a complete hat head.  It would look really good.  You wouldn't be able to get a good indication.  How long before I can see the finished product?  I would say by April.  Before your head finishes baking.  By April.  I would say by April 16th on Hannity, I'll be able to.  By April, it's done.  It's going to be done.  There'll be enough hair and I'll be able to cut the rest of it where it's short enough  where it blends in very well. 
[01:45:00]  I'm, I'm, I, $10,000, I will say this.  Yeah.  I, I, I'm, I'm for that.  If, if I was losing my hair, I think I would want to.  Who would have to?  To be a nice, good head of hair on your lip.  Yeah, my neck, yeah.  Hey.  Uh.  Oh, boy.  Travis, you know.  All right.  Travis has got the update on this Willie Mays Coke thing.  We go back to it, certainly.  I don't know what this, this caller said that Willie Mays used to drink Coke.  How much Coke?  Like a six pack.  A six pack of Coke.  With the cocaine in it. 
[01:45:30]  Right.  So, uh, Willie Mays, whose rookie year was 1951.  And, and Coke stopped using cocaine in 1903.  1903.  So what, he was drinking some old Coca-Cola.  Putting little spoonfuls of Coke in his Coke.  Yeah, you could just, you could just put some Coke in your Coke.  Yeah, you know.  Sure.  Drink it that way.  Was he eating spinach back when Major Farms pop up real quick?  Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke, Coke.  They're getting on ballplayers for eating spinach?  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  Gina is going to, like, bust Anthony's bubble a little bit here. 
[01:46:00]  Gina.  Oh, here we go.  All right, Gina.  All right, what happened?  Okay, I don't mean to burst the bubble.  My boyfriend had it done as well.  He had sort of like the monk situation going,  so it probably was a little bit more than what you have.  It does get better, but it's not the type of situation  where there's like beautiful, thick, lustrous, long, thick hair  back to being 23 again.  I wasn't saying 23 again. 
[01:46:30]  Okay, 40 again.  I wasn't saying.  And Gina, can I please ask you a question?  I don't.  Gina, I want to know, because I'm a fat dude,  and I think there's certain aesthetics in life, right?  When I, as a guy, look at a guy with the horseshoe bald head,  he looks so much older and worse.  More adult.  Like a 22-year-old guy that's completely bald, 
[01:47:00]  it just looks so old.  With a woman's eyes, do you still see that handsome young guy,  or hair is very important?  Hair is really important, but you do grant somebody quite a bit of leeway  when they're like over 30.  With a huge hog.  Yeah, I think that would count.  I mean like a 25-year-old guy, a 25-year-old guy who's gone bald.  Like a 25-year-old man who's gone bald who looks 35.  That's bad.  To me, to my eyes, I'm like, wow, he looks old. 
[01:47:30]  But to a woman, are you able to see that youngness?  She said she'd agree.  No, if it's young, like 20, 25, 28, that's really not good.  I would feel bad for the guy because he would have, like, dating problems.  That just is not going to be good.  Now, I want info out of Gina.  How many follicles did he have put in?  He had quite a, it was like, it wasn't a cheapy job.  This was a...  Where was it done?  It was done in my house.  In the back of a Sunoco.  Freddie's follicle shop. 
[01:48:00]  It was top of the line, you know, the whole thing.  Oh, please.  How big was his bald spot?  It was bigger than yours.  Did he have a healthy harvest area?  Yeah, healthy harvest.  That harvest area.  That stupid harvest area.  Almost, like, always good.  No, they stood him in a field with a bunch of other guys.  They flew a crop duster with hair seeds in it to hope for the best.  I'm noticing where it's growing in already.  I'm suspicious because no one has taken a look at it. 
[01:48:30]  Wow.  No, I'm not saying it doesn't grow in.  It does grow in.  Anthony, what did you hear where the fallbacks were?  What were the fallbacks in terms of when the doctor was talking to you about what could possibly not work?  What was the fallback?  Was it that you were either going to look like perfectly normal or like the Hawaiian punch dog?  I think the men think it's going to really just bring them back to a little bit of an unrealistic place.  Let the laughs happen.  Well, you know something, I've seen before and afters on a lot of people. 
[01:49:00]  And if you're starting out with not a lot of hair, it's going to be very difficult to take a patch from the back of your head and throw it up top and make it, you know, fill it in, fill in the frigging dead spot.  You know, it's like anything else.  No, no, I understand.  It's like deforestation.  Oh, man talking.  Go ahead.  Jeez.  You made a good point.  It's sort of like imagine breast implants.  There's good, there's better, there's best.  I mean, there's different levels.  You went to top of the line.  I went top of the line. 
[01:49:30]  Top of the line breasts still aren't as good as perfect non-top of the line breasts.  I'm sorry.  Somebody that's got a whiz on my parade.  Thank you, Jim.  I'm sorry.  Shut it.  And tell old Baldy to stick it.  Exactly.  Thanks for calling emasculating buzzkill.  What a fun girl she is.  Oh, God.  Hope she gets mange of the crotch.  And, Ope, your head is just completely, you have a full forehead.  No, I got my issues. 
[01:50:00]  A little bit of this, a little bit of that.  Yeah, a little bit.  But not much, though.  You don't think I'm paying close attention to him?  I'll make the jokes right alongside with you guys, but, you know.  You're taking a look.  Yeah, I might be two or three years behind my buddy over there.  Would you do it?  I don't know.  I'm waiting to see the big reveal.  The big reveal.  I don't see what's happening, though.  Now, mine's more kind of like in here, in front sort of, in the middle sort of. 
[01:50:30]  See, they could relate it to stress.  They could grab that out and plop that in.  But the stress thing, when you lose your hair because of stress, that crap will grow back.  Stress?  What the hell are you talking about?  When you lose, when you don't lose it in. . .  You've been stressed for 10 years?  When you don't lose it in the back or the front and it's losing in between, that's a stress thing.  Yeah.  And you could, like, turn that around, my friend.  And what does Rogaine do?  Obviously nothing.  Oh, Jesus.  What is Rogaine supposed to do?  Same thing. 
[01:51:00]  Re-brew your hair.  But what's the process?  It brings the dead follicle back to life?  But it only works up here.  Up at the top, he's pointing to the back of his head.  See, there's male pattern baldness, which is in the back area and the receding.  But it doesn't work on the front receding, Rogaine.  And what do you have?  I have the back and I put some follicles up in the front.  So you didn't have male pattern baldness?  Yeah, I did.  It was starting.  My father was, like, bald at 22.  Wow.  So I went many years of. . .  And Norton cuts all his hair off. 
[01:51:30]  And Norton has a complete full set of hair.  I just shave it down very close to the. . .  But you can see my hair.  I do have a full head of hair.  My dad's not bald either, though.  My mother is.  My mother has the horseshoe.  It's nothing more shocking than a bald woman.  My mother has hair like the father from Mork and Mindy.  That crap is horrible.  When I see those Hindu. . .  I had a Hindu doctor.  She was bald.  Yeah.  Telling me I had blood pressure.  I'm just looking at you like. . .  Your blood pressure must be through the roof. 
[01:52:00]  It's popping out your hair follicles.  I love the old ladies, you see, with the white cotton candy hair that you can see right through.  Their skull.  You can see through to the produce in the supermarket right through their hair.  It just must be shocking to be a bald woman.  Horrendous.  Oh, you see.  Horrendous.  Blue veins in their head.  All right.  Let's get to break.  Because Sam just ran in the story about the running of the brides.  He said this is really good.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And we've got to take a peek at that.  And importantly, tonight, comics, 730, I think.  It's the Funniest Lister Contest.  Oh.  We've got contestants. 
[01:52:30]  Of course, open air will be there.  I will stop in, and Voss is hosting, and it should actually be a really fun night.  And while that's going on, I'll be in Hasbrook?  Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey.  But don't go there.  Come see us.  You could do both.  If you live in Jersey.  Actually, you could do both.  You could come tonight to see this and go see Patrice tomorrow night because he's there  Saturday, too.  So don't expect good numbers tonight, Patrice.  What about me tonight?  Comics can only hold so many people.  Listen, folks, can you come out and treat my show like Anthony's head? 
[01:53:00]  Just be a follicle.  Just sit in a chair like a hair follicle.  Just plant yourself in a grove.  You don't want your show like his head.  That'd be sparse.  A big empty room with five people.  I have follicle.  Are you trying to take our listeners from the Harvest area and bring them to your show?  Yes.  That'd be nice.  There's only 50 seats available, and there's only 50 seats left.  You're going to do fine.  All right, good.  Because Patrice is going to be off the grid.  I mean, who knows when you're going to be able to see him again.  Hey, it's Friday. 
[01:53:30]  F.U. Friday.  Let's see what you guys are bitching about today.  Thanks for calling the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.  You have seven new voice messages.  First voice message.  Hi, I want to send a big F.U. to the douchebag sitting a couple of rows in front of me at  Little Jimmy's show in Philly.  Hey, asshole.  This show is not about you.  Shut up.  I hope you drove your drunk ass into a tree on the way home. 
[01:54:00]  Fuck you.  Next message.  This goes out to all you dumb, dumb BMW drivers.  Last week, it was a stupid hole in her convertible.  This week, it's a stupid douche with a dumb screaming metal bumper sticker on your little 5 Series Beamer.  And you sat through a green light, you asshole.  Making me late for my fucking class.  Because this light doesn't change for another 10 minutes. 
[01:54:30]  You asshole.  Thanks for being a dick and being part of the problem.  You fucking Beamer driver.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Beamer's are so good.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Hey, bedbugs, I'm tired of my balls being a mess.  Fuck you, bedbugs.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you to the guy in the one Cadillac Escalade 
[01:55:00]  that decided he was bigger than the tractor trailer I was driving  and got in front of me and slammed on the brakes.  Fuck you, boy adventurer, dummy.  I didn't slow down, did I?  Fuck you.  You ran.  Ha ha.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big F you to my doctor  for giving me an impromptu rectal exam right in front of my new wife.  Thanks for completely emasculating me.  I will never get late again.  Thanks a lot, you crazy Polynesian freak. 
[01:55:30]  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to give a big fuck you to everybody that I work with  because they're all standing around doing nothing.  Joey, Johnny, Tom, Don, everybody.  Fuck you.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big fuck you to my boss.  Hey, dickhead.  Hope you break your fucking leg out in Salt Lake City this weekend, you cocksucker.  Fucking telling me I'm going to get a promotion and then you hire two guys and, oh yeah, 
[01:56:00]  you got to compete for the new position now?  You fucking little dickhead.  Fuck you.  Next, that's you.  Next message.  Call the OPNF, the FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  Where's my Clash fans?  Any Clash fans in the room?  Anywhere?  Clash? 
[01:56:30]  Clash?  London College?  Lost in the supermarket?  Where are you guys?  Trader Bain?  Going with the hits, obviously.  Thumbs up?  All right, there you go.  Sam, what do you got?  You got Running Up the Brides?  Running Up the Brides today.  Oh, let me turn this bed down.  Sam got the ponytail now.  Yeah, he's trying to get himself together.  It ain't working.  Your girl is starting to look at you different now, so you're trying to upgrade yourself,  my friend.  Yeah, she looks at me very differently.  Like, when I have my hair pulled back, if she comes home and it's out, she goes, I thought 
[01:57:00]  you had your hair pulled back today.  Yeah, that's right.  There you go, Sam.  Smart man.  He's instinctively keeping his girl on the tools.  Who are you kidding?  She wants you to be an animal, though.  She wants you to come home and see that wild hair and go, Sam, take me.  Right now.  You look a little better, Sam.  You look a little better.  A little more dignified.  Yeah.  What do you got?  Does she pull on it when you're doing certain things?  No, no.  She doesn't.  Her hands don't go up towards my hair.  No?  She's a pure white girl.  I've seen Sam's woman.  What do her hands do? 
[01:57:30]  Pull your ears?  No, they don't go above the neck.  Well, I mean, when you're doing that, where your hands, like her hands would be on your  head, but they would be below her waist.  You know, when that's going on, does she grab a big handful of that?  When you're getting stink face.  Steven S. from Bayshore wants to know if the internet sensation Fat E-Rock will be attending  the event at Comics tonight.  Yes, he will.  All right.  There you go.  Now we all got to go to Comics tonight. 
[01:58:00]  Fat E-Rock will be making a very special appearance.  No one's going to call on that, though, which is disappointing.  Yeah.  You know, I know it's just going to be nobody saying, hey, Fat E-Rock.  No.  They probably don't have the guts, and they think it'll be disrespectful.  A bunch of mooseys.  They definitely won't make, like, a big deal and start shouting, oh, my God, it's Fat E-Rock.  No, no, no.  I couldn't see the listeners doing that.  I want the listeners to point in excitement when he arrives, like, oh, my God.  Yeah.  There he is.  There he is.  He really is fat. 
[01:58:30]  He really is fat.  Sam, what do you got with the running of the brides?  Well, today's the running of the brides at Filene's Basement.  What does that mean?  It's like thousands of women, and some of them drag men along.  They line up outside of Filene's because they take all their wedding dresses, and they discount  them, like, a huge amount, and then the girls and some of the men all run in and have to  grab however many dresses they can get and try them on and stuff.  And you gave me a thumbs up on this audio.  Well, yeah, because the CW decided to... 
[01:59:00]  What time did people start lining up?  They started at, like, 11 o'clock last night.  I just hate everyone.  How great would it be?  They could just buy...  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  They could just buy them?  Yeah.  Or what?  I mean, they go and try them on.  They said they were like...  Deep discount?  Yeah, they said they were like as cheap as $250.  Ant, please.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong, Ant?  I'm sick.  Come on, Ant.  When did you get sick?  I've been sick since last night.  Oh.  I didn't know.  I got to him.  I got to him. 
[01:59:30]  Why is this audio good?  I'm a ninja.  Because the CW decided to put, like, a live shot and just comment on it as the women were  running in.  Oh, that's got to be true.  And they're going like, oh, look at how much fun.  It's very festive until the camera pans to the left, and there's one woman that's just  face first on the ground.  Nice.  Not moving?  No, she's not moving.  That's fantastic.  Did she drop dead of a heart attack?  Oh, but you know, they had to get to sports.  You know something?  I got to say something about these things.  Why? 
[02:00:00]  How come one dopey radio show kills some woman making her drink water?  Yeah.  You know?  And there's nothing.  You can't do anything with water, food, anything.  Yep.  But these stand on line, fling the doors open, and let people charge like animals over each  other, they keep doing it, and people just keep getting injured or killed.  Right.  Well, it's legal.  It's their lawyers.  It's the lawyers.  Yeah.  Well, you would think the lawyers would say, put a stop to this stampeding. 
[02:00:30]  People die on Black Friday every year.  What?  Yeah.  Black Friday, you know.  Black Friday.  It's the day after Thanksgiving.  It's not racist.  Yeah.  It's okay.  It's all right, Patrice.  My bad.  Yeah.  You're ready to rise up.  Why's Friday got to be back?  You thought they meant today?  Are you ready to rise up?  I don't know what.  All right.  Let's play the audio and see where we go with this.  Whatever one I like the best. 
[02:01:00]  Look at how festive they are.  There's some in, like, the Irish colors.  You know, they've got their hats on.  You know, they know what teams they're a part of.  Once again, this is a live shot of Filene's Basement.  Wow.  In Union Square.  In Union Square.  And look, they are Grammy.  Oh, I see a catfight.  A little catfight going on there.  Come on.  But the other thing, too, is, like, I don't know.  I don't even think the sizes are sorted out.  So I don't know what size it will be.  Oh, someone's down.  Someone is down.  And, of course, Doug.  Oh, I hope she's okay.  I hope she's okay, too.  You dopey.  The old I hope she's okay gag. 
[02:01:30]  You can get the famous oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, it's the grape lady, right?  Can you get that?  They always got to put on that phony, oh, I hope she's okay.  No, they don't.  What was that other one where the guy fell down?  She's dead.  Can you think of anything better than a trampling death of filings?  Oh, with the wedding gowns all over the place.  Oh, and a flash fire.  Fantastic.  And the women wonder why we call them broads.  Big day coming up.  These women are acting like broads, fighting over a wedding dress.  You said the grape lady, Opie.  Did you see the family guy? 
[02:02:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God, man.  Fantastic.  That is getting, that show is getting just funnier and funnier, man.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They canceled that stupid show.  They had to bring that thing back.  It was funny from day one.  Oh, my God, dude.  Stewie doing, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Maybe we can find that, too.  Give me all those clips.  Oh, look who's on.  What?  Why don't we have Paul Stanley? 
[02:02:30]  I thought that was Paul Stanley's mother.  That wig is not follicles.  That is.  It proves that this follicle thing doesn't work.  Someone like Cam would be getting that.  He would be getting this.  Who is this guy?  Paul Stanley.  He's got more money than.  He doesn't have enough follicles to harvest.  The guy's completely bald under that.  He has Kathy Bates head.  That hair hat he's wearing.  You know, I hope your hair looks natural enough so that I don't have to be fake. 
[02:03:00]  Dude, he could have taken the hair off his chest and put it on his head.  Dude, why doesn't he get one of those hair systems like Captain Kirk has?  Captain Kirk finally figured it out, Shatner.  He finally figured out, like, what looks kind of natural, even though he's got nothing on under there.  What guy goes out of the house and thinks the hairy chest thing is still happening?  Yeah, he's got it.  What is that about?  And he's got to unbutton the shirt down.  Why doesn't he harvest the follicles from his chest?  I just said that! 
[02:03:30]  I know.  I'm going to listen to the replay.  It sounds silly.  Oh.  He looks like Stallone's mother.  He does look like Stallone's mother.  What is he, selling artwork or something?  He's an artist, yeah.  Oh, shut up.  He is not.  Look at that piece of crap.  Look at the garbage he's trying to pull off his heart.  Really?  Really?  What is that?  What is that?  Oh, that sucks.  I like to look at art, to be honest with you.  But that is like, what is that?  It looks like two girls, one cup.  Yeah.  I disagree.  I think it's very good.  What did he use as a brush?  His hair?  It looks like he went into... 
[02:04:00]  It looks like he went into Tub Girl's bathtub with a canvas and just let her go.  It's just...  It's not a wig.  It's an abstract anything.  Black wig on his head.  Look at that wig.  Picasso stinks.  Dude, look at the part.  Hey, hey.  He's got no hairline in the front.  I refuse to like it.  That is a wig.  I refuse to like anything that's not looking exactly like it's supposed to look.  Jimmy.  You don't know Picasso, then.  It's a wig.  He went through different stages.  It's not a wig.  That's a wig.  It's not.  Look at that hairline. 
[02:04:30]  Like Norman Rockwell.  Oh, he made a heart.  Look at that thing.  That's like a kid.  A kid would make that for a belly.  That looks like a kid.  K-Jeweler's design.  What is that, Jimmy?  It's a star.  A Mona Lisa with his own face in there.  That's art.  What's his name did that type of art?  Peter Max.  Thank you, son.  He's ripping off Peter Max.  Peter Chris.  He rots.  Who's other bad artist that was famous for being bad?  Oh, is he terrible at that friggin' show? 
[02:05:00]  They're showing kiss footage.  Everyone but Paul, there is.  Whatever.  That was in the old days.  Look, see?  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God, with that wig.  Can we get back to the running of the brides?  Because last we left you, we got the fatty down.  She's out for the count.  All right.  I want to see how this ends.  A woman who is slightly too large and wearing bright pink sweatpants lying on the floor.  I got to see them.  I hope she's okay.  Someone is down.  And, of course, uh...  Oh, I hope she's okay.  I hope she's okay, too, because we're going to have a live report later this hour.  Oh, goodness. 
[02:05:30]  This is looking a little...  Yeah.  Tragic.  All right.  That's a downer.  Of course, this is, you know, meant to be fun, but sometimes someone can't agree to get  it.  Uh-huh.  We don't mean to make fun of that at all.  I hope that woman is okay.  We hope she's okay.  Shut up!  Wow.  These guys can't improv.  Can they just lay off on it?  Have they given an update?  Not yet, but...  Oh, that means she's dead.  Oh.  Oh, this is tragic.  I hope she's okay.  Oh, we don't want to be making fun.  Oh, please, I hope she's dead.  It'll help our ratings.  I'll please be dead.  You think he dies is just dead?  It's not our ratings. 
[02:06:00]  They'll bury her in one of those bride's dresses.  Because she would have wanted it this way.  Yeah.  He'll probably marry the corpse, because that's what she wanted.  And then bury his...  That is such a wig, Jimmy.  It's not a wig.  I'm telling you.  Look at the part and the hairline.  There's no hairline.  There's no natural hairline there.  It's not a wig.  And he got more hair than he ever had.  It's fine.  It's a hat.  It's a hair hat.  I want to see him in an elevator and have some large gentlemen remove his hat. 
[02:06:30]  What?  I'm telling you, it's not a wig.  I've been following Paul Stanley for years.  Oh.  It's a wig.  All right.  Horrid.  Thank you, Sam.  You're welcome, Opie.  That's a good one.  Maybe we can get an update and see if you look at it.  Yeah, let's try to get an update on her.  I'll find one.  She may, you know.  Maybe we can Google her.  Did he run in the Stewie thing or what?  From Patrice?  Yeah, we can't find the Stewie one.  Really?  We used to have it.  Another one that was funny is Peter singing The Rose when I was driving. 
[02:07:00]  Did you see that one?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  He said, listen, they were traveling.  It's a singing traveling song.  He just started singing The Rose.  Oh, man.  That show makes me laugh, man.  You know, speaking of family guy, I was talking to Blatter after the show yesterday.  He goes, he doesn't know Pat from Munaki because he's relatively new to the Opie and Anthony  show Blatter, right?  He goes, man, he's like a real-life Peter Griffin, isn't he?  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, you know what?  You nailed him.  That's Pat.  All this happy-go-lucky just going with everything. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  Is that as hurt as yesterday?  That diabetes, is it ravaging him?  Well, he doesn't.  He tries to, you know.  Take care of himself.  But he can't really.  He doesn't have the medication.  He can't afford this.  He's got, you know.  Yeah.  He doesn't eat right.  Poor guy.  He lives in a trailer at the end of the runway at Teterboro.  You've got to take a little responsibility.  You've got the diabetes.  You're trying to take care of yourself, right?  Yeah.  It's tough, but.  Yeah.  Do we have the clip of the guy falling down and they were concerned about him? 
[02:08:00]  Which one was that?  I don't know.  There was a guy that fell down, too?  Where's he rocking?  Can I say my favorite thing that I've seen?  He was doing weather or something and he fell in the snow.  That one's really funny.  My favorite.  Did you ever see Fat Chick Falls down a hole?  Oh, that is fantastic.  I've never seen it until yesterday.  It's very, it's like 15.  I haven't seen it.  Please show that.  I haven't seen it either.  It's pretty old.  It's like 15 seconds long.  It's wonderful.  But it's so good.  It's better than the Zapruder film.  Jimmy, explain it before we play it for Patrice.  It's store camera footage. 
[02:08:30]  There's a big fat cashier and there's some people behind her, workers, and there's a trap  door behind the register, I guess, where they go downstairs.  Well, that's where they keep all their supplies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because it's a city.  And, uh, and, uh, why so, what do you, that was the fast motion version.  Well, how about a slow motion one?  Wait, what happened?  I don't know.  Danny put on fast motion and ruined everything.  Watch this, Patrice.  She has no idea.  She backs up.  They open the trap door behind her.  She has no idea because they're putting supplies down there.  I love how she tries to not fall. 
[02:09:00]  It's just wonderful.  And she, like, just steps backwards.  You can't not enjoy this.  Look at how fat she is.  She steps backwards.  They cut it short.  Probably because it got really pecked off.  That's a good one.  Show another one.  She disappears completely.  Watch when this monster trumbles into a hole.  This should be called Monster in a Hole.  Can we link this today?  I know.  It's been out there, but relink it.  Onaradio.com.  Classic.  Ah, she disappears.  Oh, is that the greatest thing you've ever seen? 
[02:09:30]  Ah, look at this, dummy.  Oh.  The shock.  Her arms wave when she's falling.  I'm like, oh.  I can't see it again.  I can watch that a hundred times.  She's trying to hold on to the door and she misses.  It looks like E-Roc devouring a hoagie.  Oh, God.  Can you imagine not having any way to not stop that?  There was nothing she could do.  There was nothing she could hold on to or anything.  She fell until she stopped falling. 
[02:10:00]  Like, that's what...  The only thing that can stop her is Earth.  She definitely...  The over and over again replay is just killing her.  Because she has this really weird, like, guy hairdo.  And she falls.  She goes like, ah.  You can see her mouth screaming.  Yeah, because she...  Ah.  And her right foot steps into the hole and then fat left foot gets dragged in.  And Patrice is right.  When you get in that situation, there's always something you could kind of do, like grab  on or...  She tries right there.  She falls and all she can do is wait to stop. 
[02:10:30]  That's all she's doing.  The one leg's hanging out.  I have never been happier with footers than this.  Oh, is that fantastic?  That's a great one.  For Patrice, everyone.  Congratulations.  You two now own the hottest spot in town.  How'd you pay for all this?  I got a job as a field reporter for Channel 5 News.  And all the juice is being collected underneath?  Yes, and whoever collects the most is going to win a free weekend here at the Chateau  with international foods and wine tastings.  Stop.  Oh. 
[02:11:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I can't breathe.  I can't breathe.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Gosh.  We'll have to send someone to make sure that he is.  That is.  Have you ever met Seth MacFarlane?  Has he done the show?  Hey, you know what?  He's done the show a few times.  Oh, Seth is done.  Yeah, he's been on the phone.  On the phone.  God almighty, he must be a funny dude.  I love his show, but on the phone, he's a dullard.  Is he really? 
[02:11:30]  I've got to be honest.  Oh, man.  We love him.  We love him.  That's hard to believe.  We love him.  He just seems like he would be a dude funny, man.  No.  He was kind of dry and just almost like he wasn't even into being on the phone with us.  He was booked on a flight, the first plane that hit the towers.  Yeah.  And he missed his flight.  He was late.  He's got the ticket and everything.  Yeah.  Look at Patrice's eyes.  Yeah.  He's got the ticket to prove it and everything.  He missed his flight.  True story.  That must have missed. 
[02:12:00]  That's probably.  That changed your life, man.  Yeah.  You know there's 100% you know that you were dead if you were there.  It's like everything from here on in his gravy.  Because it's like, well, if I would have left a little later, I wouldn't have had that car accident.  There's always that weird, would I have, wouldn't I have.  But that's a case where you know 100%.  Guaranteed you were gone.  You've got to skip through the rest of your life.  You're right, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  100%.  You have cancer in 30 years.  You can't complain.  That guy's not having one bad day from this day.  Wow. 
[02:12:30]  What?  Yeah.  All right, let's play first flight.  We've got to go.  I can't front, man.  I love when Patrice does a show.  You brought tears to my eyes today.  Tears in his eyes, I guess.  Just the laughter.  Yeah, I was laughing so hard because of you that my eyes are tearing.  Bananas tonight, right, Patrice?  Bananas and.  Oh, the ride update?  Yeah.  And?  Just play it?  Yeah.  Oh.  Bananas tonight and tomorrow.  I say blow off our appearance at Comics and go see Patrice.  Hasbro Heights? 
[02:13:00]  Hasbro Heights.  Hasbro's a game company.  Hasbro.  Hasbro Heights.  Just think if you owned a brook.  Yeah.  201-727-1090 for tickets to see Patrice O'Neill.  Oof.  Boo.  Here's your running of the brides update.  These girls are determined to find the perfect dress, and they're helping each other out to  do it.  Now, I know you guys saw some video of a woman who had fallen a little bit earlier.  We're happy to say that her bride is still back here trying on dresses, so it looks  like she is going to be doing just fine.  She was taken out of here a little while ago, but she was sitting up and smiling. 
[02:13:30]  But they didn't say that she's okay.  No.  They said her bride.  Her bride.  So the person that she's with, they said the person she's with is shopping.  Oh.  And all they said about her was she was able to sit up.  They took her out of there.  Yes.  Oh, there's a problem.  Yep.  There's a problem.  I hope so.  They didn't even say she could stand up.  No.  Yeah.  She was sitting up.  Yeah.  Hope right now her spinal column looks like a windshield after it cracks.  Oh, man.  Just shattered.  Fat sort of filings.  I'm still disturbed about that ticket thing you just said. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Isn't that something?  It just messed me up.  We got to go.  We're going to end Black History Month with this.  Oh, wow.  It is the end of Black History Month.  This is it.  We've been honoring a lot of fine individuals all month.  Patrice, you'd be proud.  You'd be very proud of us.  Quite a few.  Extremely proud of us.  Here's the last one.  I guess we're just going to leave after this, so.  Yeah.  We'll see everybody at Comics tonight.  14th Street and 9th Avenue.  It's a fine club.  It's C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com online if you need directions or details about what's going on 
[02:14:30]  tonight.  Jimmy's going to be there.  I'm going to be there.  Voss is going to be there.  Sick Anthony.  And hopefully Anthony will be there.  Bring your blankie there.  Just bring your big blankie.  Bring a Snuggie.  Oh, can someone bring Anthony a brand new Snuggie?  I don't want a Snuggie.  I'll blow my nose in it and throw it at you.  To celebrate Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is recognizing those historic  African Americans without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor Officer Moses Hightower from the Police Academy film series. 
[02:15:00]  After years spent organizing orchids, Hightower felt it was time for a change and left the  flower shop to pursue a career in criminal justice.  I got bored with my chosen profession.  What was that?  I was a florist.  A florist?  You know, flowers and shit.  In spite of his massive stature, he was a gentle giant.  But there was that one time where he posed as a voodoo-crazed serial killer to tease new  recruits.  Yuma, yuma, yuma, yuma.  Yuma, yuma, yuma, yuma, yuma. 
[02:15:30]  Those movies just get funnier and funnier with every sequel they crank out.  And with that, we bid farewell to Black History Month on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And one of the things that's done is right here, these buckets are filled with grapes.  What kind of grapes?  These are filled with Chamberson grapes.  And the winner this Saturday who stomps the most juice will actually win an overnight stay  here at Chateau Lawn.  You ready?  You ready to try it?  Yeah, sure.  Let's go.  That's disgusting.  Let's go.  All right. 
[02:16:00]  You ready?  Give us a 30-second time.  Here we go.  So what's the deal here?  There's a contest to stomp.  And how are you measuring who does the best stomping?  And whoever stomps the most juice wins an overnight stay.  But it's not the only thing you can do.  The measuring cups are down below, right?  Measuring cups are down below.  All right.  And if you win, you get to stay at Chateau Lawn.  And what else do you have going on here?  Well, a grape something's not your thing.  You can come and spend the day listening to live music, eating international foods, having  wine tours and tasting, vineyard tours, seminars, arts and crafts. 
[02:16:30]  It's a lot of fun.  A whole day.  Stop.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
[02:17:00]  That whole clip is the, ouch, ouch, yeah, ouch.  Yeah, that had a hurt.  And convinced me to get a gun.  Steven, New Jersey.  Well, that's just wonderful.  Oh, good for you.  Good, good, good.  Good for you. 
[02:17:30]  I like our new attorney general saying that in order to keep the crime from running rampant in Mexico,  that we're going to completely throw away the Second Amendment and ban certain weapons here.  That's wonderful.  Is this a best of legal weapons?  Is this a best of?  No, because now this stupid fucking attorney general is using, yeah, not banning Mexicans.  First of all, do you honestly think that people are going to gun stores, 
[02:18:00]  buying what is called an assault weapon, which is just a fucking joke of a name to scare people.  It's a gun that looks cool, but it's like any other hunting rifle, semi-automatic.  It's not a machine gun.  Do you really think the Mexicans are importing the expensive fucking guns from the United States  or perhaps shit from South America and wherever else they could afford to buy shittier guns? 
[02:18:30]  No, I think they're buying them from some guy in Texas.  Do you really think they are?  Absolutely, because that's where Mexicans live in Texas.  Bullshit.  They're buying some cheap shit guns.  They're buying some good American-made fucking guns that cost $2,000 at a clip.  You bought a $2,000 gun?  Of course I did.  Why wouldn't I?  What's the most expensive gun you have?  $2,000.  No, probably the Desert Eagle was about $2,700. 
[02:19:00]  A Desert Eagle, great gun.  We talked about it before, but I enjoy that gun.  .50 caliber shit.  You shot a Desert Eagle, Patrice?  No, I enjoy it.  I only seen it on movies.  You just enjoy looking at it?  Yeah, I've never shot a gun before.  Yeah, you're like me.  It's fantastic.  Movie guns that look cool, but I don't know how to shoot them.  They use that in a lot of movies, that kind of thing.  And how do you supposed to shoot a Desert Eagle?  You got to hold it straight?  Yeah, you got to hold it straight.  You can't limp wrist it.  No, one hand.  You can't fly that thing away.  One hand.  You can't do it like gangsta style where you hold it to the style and go like this  and your hand go like that?  Nah.  You got to hold it pretty straight. 
[02:19:30]  You can't even flip your elbows up.  You got to kind of back with your shoulders.  It's a gun jam.  It's a wall.  It's a wall.  It's a wall.  There's something wrong with that headphone, Jack.  There's a lot of people saying they can't hear when they're in that spot.  Got to fix it for Patrici.  And I got to give you the other side of the argument today because there was, and please,  you know, sarcasm in my voice because people don't understand sometimes.  Four shootings in 24 hours in East New York now. 
[02:20:00]  You know, you get some of these guns off the street.  Ah, boy, are we going to have four shootings in 24 hours in East New York?  No.  You know what?  Because I love that because in East New York, every time I go to the gun store in East New  York and legally buy guns in East New York and then walk out of the shop,  I usually end up in some kind of a shooting.  Do you honestly, do you think that is legal handguns?  Yes.  So legislate against the legal gun owner.  Look, we disagree on a bunch of things, but I've got to tell you something, my friend. 
[02:20:30]  You turned me around on this gun argument.  I love guns.  You really did turn me around.  I was one of those rah, rah, let's get some of these guns off the street type of guy.  And then I was educated by you on some of this stuff.  I think you're still, like, I still think you're upset.  You're obsessed with guns and all that.  It's like any other hobby.  I enjoy them.  But the bad guys are going to get the guns.  There are hundreds of gun control laws already.  And what are they doing?  They don't work with crime.  Why do you need so many fucking guns?  Attaboy, Patrice. 
[02:21:00]  I enjoy collecting guns.  Why can't someone collect, people collect fucking thimbles?  Because Jerry Seinfeld collects cars?  Don't collect the bullets.  But I need the bullets to shoot through the gun.  That's like Jerry Seinfeld buying cars and no gas.  He likes driving his cars.  You know what?  Fuck it.  He doesn't just...  He likes Colin Quinn pushing his cars down the street.  He doesn't strap a car to himself when he walks around the house, you fucking kook.  Well, only sometimes.  When I'm down in the theater now, because there's no exit. 
[02:21:30]  There's just one door.  If I get a home invasion, they walk in there.  That's true.  Oh, you and this home invasion, would you please?  What?  It never happens.  Just put gates...  Look up home invasion in Long Island.  Just put gates on your windows like I did.  Oh, that's good.  It'll look like fucking South Central.  Oh, man.  Every house in South Central looks like a fucking jail.  I put I am legend gates on my shit.  I am legend gates.  Amp, can I ask you a question about this home invasion thing?  Oh, yeah.  How are they going to invade your home when the lights never go out? 
[02:22:00]  That is true.  There's always movement and action in your house.  How the fuck are they going to...  Well, it's just a silhouette of a man that just goes on a track.  Yeah, it's on a track to make it look like someone's just pacing at night the whole time.  Home invaders don't care if their lights are on.  Do you have a lot of motion sensors in your house, too?  No.  I got an alarm system.  ADT?  If that door opens up, that alarm's going to fucking go off.  Really?  And shit like that, yeah.  So why do you need guns, also?  Because I don't have the alarm set all the time. 
[02:22:30]  Sometimes, when I have guests coming over, like, last night there was a poker game at  the house.  Talked about it on the air.  Hence the poker flow.  Things like that.  Do you think I want somebody thinking, hey, there's a poker game going on at Anthony's.  You know, I might be able to score a little bit of cash if me and my buddies kick open  the door and fucking, you know, raid Anthony's poker game and grab his cash.  They don't know what my buy-in is.  But they know the listeners.  What are they going to get?  $40?  Yeah, exactly.  True.  So if that ever happened, I'm packing what they call heat. 
[02:23:00]  And, you know, I'm TCB, as they say.  TCB.  Take care of business.  No, I'm very safe.  I'm a very safe gun owner.  I'm very responsible with my guns.  Yeah.  Always know if they're what?  Do you have a say hello to my little friend gun?  I have a very close one.  I don't have a grenade launcher, but I do have two of those.  If your sister tries to come and fuck you and then a Mexican shoots her in the back. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then you go to try to get that gun and then you look at her and talk to her for a minute.  I talk to her for a little while.  Give her a kiss.  Tell her to stay there.  Give her a little kiss.  Don't move.  You know, scanners.  So you have a, what's your say hello to my little friend gun?  That would be my AR-15.  It's got the bipod on it.  It's got a laser sight, flashlight, front grip attachment.  Yes, it's very good for close quarters, like in the house.  When 50 was on, did you have a gun discussion with him? 
[02:24:00]  No, I would have liked to, but there was so much other stuff.  That guy is a business man.  That man knows his business.  You should have talked about them guns, man.  I would have, but that man shot nine times.  Probably doesn't want to discuss guns.  AR-15, he's wrapped up.  I've heard AR-15s in a big rap gun.  AK-47s, though, is like the gun of a homeboy.  Nah, that was, nah, rap, that was the, that's old school.  That's 80s, mid-80s rap gun.  Cool Moe D had a fucking AK-47.  Cool Moe D.  Fucking the educated rapper. 
[02:24:30]  And I hate when anyone talks Glock to me.  Glocks are homie guns, man.  They're just homie guns.  They passe.  Yeah, they're so passe.  AR-15 is in a very recent rap.  Yeah.  I gotta find out which one it is.  People like the AR-15s.  Nice 30-round clip, pre-band.  How about a nice snub-nosed .38 with a grip?  I don't like what they call a wheel gun.  I don't like the revolvers.  I like automatics.  Well, excuse me, motherfucker.  I like automatics.  They're fun.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  You're very, uh... 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  I like that shit.  You're very classy about your pistols.  I really am.  I like that.  I have a little drawer that I open up, and I accessorize.  You got any of those little...  Depending on what I'm wearing.  Like a hand, the hidden one that comes through your fingers, and you can...  No, nothing like that.  The smallest one I have is a Walther PPK, the James Bond .380.  That's a nice one.  A little silver gun.  Damn.  Then I got the 1911 .45.  My night table gun is a SIG .45 with a laser sight on it. 
[02:25:30]  That's the gun that stays on my night table at night.  Wow.  So that way...  Loaded?  If there's any shenanigans...  Fucking A loaded.  What are you going to do?  What if you have a dream and just shoot yourself in the foot?  See, that's why I can't be a gun owner.  What am I going to have a dream and pick up a gun?  I don't fucking...  I'm just...  What if you mistake it for your Alka-Seltzer?  Take an Alka-Seltzer?  Yeah.  How do you fucking mistake a gun for Alka-Seltzer?  You go plop, plop, and by the time you hit fizz-fizz, your skull is all over the ceiling. 
[02:26:00]  He makes a mistake and blows his follicles out.  He has to start all over.  It's a fun hobby.  I like target shooting.  It's a lot of fun.  This is not a hobby, though, man.  You're a flood.  Do a jinx on a puzzle.  It takes care of two things.  It's a hobby, and it's protection, and it's my goddamn right.  As an American, to own them.  And no one can tell me different. 
[02:26:30]  That's how I feel about it.  Second Amendment.  There's speech, and then they thought that one was important enough to make number two.  Oh, God.  To shoot whoever makes an unpopular speech.  1760, that was made up, man.  Like, come on.  1760.  Well, let me tell you something.  That was back when guns were a little less dangerous and couldn't kill everybody at once.  Oh, you know what?  At once.  That's a good argument, though.  You know what?  It's a great argument, until you think of this.  They're trying to ban semi-automatic weapons.  They have been around since the 18-fucking-hundreds.  What?  Without anyone saying, we gotta ban these. 
[02:27:00]  They're too fucking modern.  Tommy guns?  And now, not Tommy guns.  Not shit like that.  You know, you can't own a machine gun.  Nah, you're not allowed to own fucking full automatics.  I could buy a Tommy gun semi-automatic, but you gotta pull the trigger every time you want a bullet to come out.  A semi-automatic.  It's not just like...  Yeah.  You're not allowed to own a machine gun.  Then why did Capone have one?  People think...  Because he was a criminal.  Oh.  People think that you're able to go out and buy machine guns.  They think of an assault weapon.  The Democrats and the liberals, they've done such a good job at fucking lying to people 
[02:27:30]  and making them think that people can go to a gun store and buy fully automatic machine guns  that they call assault weapons.  You know what an assault weapon is?  It's a hunting rifle.  Technically, a gun.  That has cool shit on it.  It makes it look cool.  Instead of the wood stock, it's maybe black plastic that looks like a military gun.  Okay.  It's got a nice scope on it, a nice little ACOG scope or something like that. 
[02:28:00]  Why?  And then here's something they don't want that they consider an assault weapon that they  don't want you to have.  A bayonet lug.  Because how many fucking bayonet charges are people killed in?  Hey.  After you use up all your bullets, now you're going to stab a motherfucker in that shit.  Now you're going to fucking charge into the fucking liquor store.  In case you're fighting Huns.  It's that.  It's things like a folding stock.  They don't like the folding stock because I guess you could conceal it better. 
[02:28:30]  But these are all things that legal gun owners wouldn't do.  It's people that don't own legal guns that do this fucking shit.  Well, it's just not necessary to have so many guns.  Nothing's necessary.  Your hats aren't fucking necessary.  Sure they are.  They keep the rain off of it.  Why do you have so many different hats?  You need one fucking hat.  Why?  It's not dangerous unless it's the same hat from Goldfinger.  Goldfinger.  Your car's fucking dangerous.  Oh, our job's fucking dangerous?  Don't watch that shit.  It's not dangerous.  It's just, you know, you have a dangerous hobby. 
[02:29:00]  It is not dangerous.  Guns are not fucking dangerous.  You had it dangerous.  Can you buy all those knives at the home shopping network?  Nah, I hate knives.  Fuck knives.  What am I going to do?  Step up to someone and stab them?  Fuck that.  Sure.  I'd love to see somebody with a knife and then you pull out a gun and go, ha ha.  It can work.  I hate knives.  I don't think most people need guns, man.  What?  I think it's dangerous.  I am a white man.  I think you're just as dangerous.  You have daydreams and kooks.  But most dangerous shit happens. 
[02:29:30]  White people, here's the thing, for real.  Dangerous white people kill everybody.  Dangerous black people kill black people.  Dangerous white people decide that they're going to fucking shoot everybody in the Toys R Us for no reason.  We have quality of crime, of murders.  You guys have quantity.  Did you just fucking say quality of murders?  We have quality of murders.  You have quantity.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  We got like the-  Fucking every high school, every McDonald's, every diner. 
[02:30:00]  How often is that shit happening?  A couple of old people sitting in the diner having some heart, some hailing hearty hail or whatever the fuck that happens.  How often is that happening?  A lot.  Bullshit.  Every day you look at convenience store footage.  You see some homeboy just pulling out a rifle on somebody.  They don't show you convenience store footage, but every day they don't fucking show you some sickening white guy who shoots up his goddamn-  Do you think how cool-  He got fired from his job.  People would love to see that.  And got fucking shot up everybody.  The news would show that in a second.  It happens all the time. 
[02:30:30]  The news would show that in a second.  Black people don't just kill people randomly.  You watch First 48.  You watch First 48.  It's the first 48 hours of an investigation of murder.  It's 99.9% black people killing other black people.  There's a-  And the point one is what?  Is Hispanic.  I've never seen a white guy on this show.  I don't understand.  All I want you to do is take credit for your sickening crimes.  You eat people.  Eat people?  You kill poor hookers that have nothing to do with nothing.  They're just trying to fuck a person. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  White criminals.  I thought you were talking about a big fucking black pot boiling in the jungle somewhere.  White murder.  Or just white murder.  White murder is pretty gruesome.  Gruesome.  Because there's like reasons for it.  You guys are just-  I should be more afraid of you.  Oh, you stepped on my foot.  Let me shoot a three-year-old and the grandmother walking by because I can't hit my fucking target.  A three-year-old stepped on my foot and I shot him?  No, no.  Some guy steps on your foot.  You pull the gun out.  You try to aim for him and you hit grandma and some fucking kid in the playground.  You just made up a black crime.  It doesn't exist. 
[02:31:30]  It happens all the time.  You're telling me little Laquisha never gets shot in the playground?  My fucking girlfriend uses the word all the time.  All the time.  When she's explaining some shit I did four months ago, she says all the time.  All right, literal, Patrice.  I don't mean all the time.  Don't say all the time.  I mean, okay.  People listen to you.  Say most of the time.  It happens very often.  So very, very rare.  Very rare.  White guys kill their wives a lot more often than black guys shoot up a liquor store.  Oh, I was going to say black guys kill their wives.  I had an answer for that one. 
[02:32:00]  We don't.  We tell our wives to shut the fuck up so we don't have to choke them to death or put them  in a freezer or feed them to some.  Why do you own pigs?  This is what I'm saying.  White guys should not own pigs to feed your wife.  It just, it just, I just want you to take credit for a lot of the shit that we should  be afraid of, of what you do.  Let me put it to you this way.  You're mass killers.  Just say you're mass killers.  Yes.  White is mass killers.  But let me tell you something.  The odds that you're going to walk around and get killed by a white serial killer or the 
[02:32:30]  odds that you're going to walk around and get killed by some black thug, the black thug  is so much more higher.  Absolutely.  Can't be.  The crime stats, black on white crime is three times more than white on black crime.  That's an absolute false.  I got that from stormfront.org.  You got it from the racial pieces of shit?  Stormfront.  I got that from harryandnation.org.  I have one of those guys as my friend.  Do you?  On MySpace. 
[02:33:00]  Really?  When I was hosting your show, he goes, I go, hey, yeah, I'm going to be hosting the show.  He goes, why should I listen to you, Sambo?  On my friends.  Jesus.  And then I wrote back, holy shit, Sambo.  I had to laugh when I heard this.  That is old school.  That's some old school shit.  That's like moon cricket.  Moon cricket.  Pieces of shit.  I'm so fed up with white people and your fucking new upsetness.  You're really sick of me.  I'm very upset with black people and the same old, same old. 
[02:33:30]  Same old, same old what?  That I fucking turn on the news every convenience store.  Every closed circuit convenience store.  Why do you, why do you not, why do you take the side of white people and you're not white?  I am white.  I can say when I fucking, when I buy a pistol, I check white and they don't go, you're not white.  Why do you take the side of white all the time?  Because I'm white.  You're not white.  I'm European.  Exactly.  Italy is from fucking Europe. 
[02:34:00]  You don't have anything to do with why black and white people don't like each other in this country.  Exactly.  So why am I hated by black people so much?  I try to tell you and you don't listen.  I'm listening.  White is like Hitler's mustache to black people.  It's just what you are.  It's a symbol.  It's a symbol.  We don't look at you like the oppressed.  Stop taking oppressed, stop being personal when black people say white.  They don't mean you.  You're a fucking egg pig.  Your great-great-grandmother slept with a moor. 
[02:34:30]  Here he goes with the fucking true romance speech.  Yes.  Give me my chest to feel, nigga.  But wait, if Anthony's in East New York, those guys are going to look at him.  They're not going to go, all right, he's not the man.  They're going to go, he's a cop.  I guarantee you.  You walk through East New York, black people are not going to bother you in East New York.  Well, they may think he's like a local, sometimes a weird Guatemalan or something.  Some fucking swarthy heroin dealer. 
[02:35:00]  That's what I mean.  You do look like the boss on a video game.  I'm a boss mom on a video game.  You really don't.  You're not a white guy.  Opie looks more like a white guy than you do.  Like a traditional white guy.  But you don't look like a traditional white guy.  That would not stop a criminal element from trying to do me harm or take my money.  I think an Italian would be more apt to do something bad to you than a black person.  Get the fuck out of here.  And a black person has never done anything to you. 
[02:35:30]  That's the thing that's fucked up.  Never.  You've never put yourself in a position to have anything done to you by a black guy.  One time in the fifth grade, I broke someone's thermos against a tree.  What?  You did something bad to a black person?  No, no.  And the glass shattered in this thermos because I just wanted to hear the glass break.  So I went back to class and I'm up at the blackboard figuring out a little problem.  What?  And the door opens up.  What?  The chalkboard.  Oh, go ahead.  And I'm figuring out a problem. 
[02:36:00]  And the door swings open and there is the principal, the woman, and this young African-American boy.  And all he did was look around the room, looked at me, and pointed at me.  And then walked away.  And then I got dragged into the office.  So actually, he was helping to stop crime.  The crime that you was committing.  And ever since then, you hated black people.  That motherfucker ratted me out.  That nigger rat.  He ratted me the fuck out. 
[02:36:30]  Did the right thing.  He ratted me out.  You was a rotten kid.  He actually told him you like he was supposed to.  And ever since then, you haven't liked black people.  When I was in Central Islip, I'd get shaken down for lunch money and things like that.  Black kids would rob you for your lunch money.  Give me 50 cents.  Give me 50 cents.  Give me 50 cents.  I'd be like, oh, shit.  I gotta give him 50 cents.  She said, no, thank you.  I don't have it.  And they would do what they did to you.  What?  Fucking with your hat. 
[02:37:00]  But he doesn't fucking.  He doesn't dislike black people.  I don't either.  You hate black people.  I love you.  I think you're great.  That doesn't count.  Why does that count?  You like black person.  Yes.  All right.  Why does everything have to be poor?  I'm one of the good ones, according to me.  I want you to like all of us because we really aren't a date.  For what we went through in this country.  Oh, here we go.  Holy shit.  We should be hijacking.  When we were fucking on Conestoga wagons going west. 
[02:37:30]  We should be hijacking everything and just driving and flying things into everything.  How long?  And we're not.  How fucking long?  We've really never done anything.  We've never done anything to this country.  Is this grudge?  What?  What?  You haven't done anything to this country.  Do you understand the tax burden that is on this country?  What the fuck are you talking about?  Why would you even say some shit like that?  What do you mean tax burden? 
[02:38:00]  50% of the prison population is African American?  Do you know what that costs?  Oh, that's Whitey's fault for poking at you.  That's because Bertie Madoff is going to get six months in his house.  Guy should have his head fucking cut off.  I have no problem with that.  And the crimes that young black men commit, they put you in jail for a long time.  And why is that?  What?  Murder?  Well, no.  Fucking rape?  Drugged in.  Armed robbery?  Most of us. 
[02:38:30]  I'm not talking about some guy selling a little weed.  That's fine.  That's who's in jail.  But.  That's who's in jail.  Oh, yeah?  We're not overwhelmingly murderers and rapists in jail.  It's overwhelmingly drug dealers.  Mm-hmm.  And the drug crimes are crazy.  And the drug culture.  And the drug crimes are racist.  The drug culture is.  You can have a fucking kilo of cocaine and do less time in jail than having a fucking,  a violent crack selling it.  It is what it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And white guys are in jail for the major shit. 
[02:39:00]  Murder, armed robbery.  Same thing.  There's two million people in jail in this country.  A million of them's white, but I know it's disproportionate, but it's disproportionate black  people being sent to jail.  I'm not trying to victimize it.  That's always the excuse, but.  Can we just say there's some legislative racism?  Let's just, can we admit it?  No.  Can we just say that it's unfair?  Do you think this country's fair to black folks?  And, and, and, and, and unfair to white people?  Like, are you?  No, no, I'm not saying unfair. 
[02:39:30]  Do you just want white people to go with that?  I'm not saying unfair to white people.  Be reasonable.  I'm saying that, uh, especially in this day and age.  Be reasonable.  We're vilified way more than we should be in this country.  Be honest.  You know something for people who live with a color that is very, has been very nasty  in, in the least to, to us, we're, we're quite friendly in terms of what we should be  in this country.  We should be insurgents in this country, but we're not.  Because over the years, uh, it's only gotten better and better for black people. 
[02:40:00]  Because somebody said you can't hang me.  It got better.  See, that's what I'm saying.  Uh, that's the one step, I mean, to tell you the truth, to be honest with you.  Fair enough.  But here's my problem.  Before he became president, um, and quite frankly, let me explain something to you also.  That he's not, um, this is, this is, the fact is Barack Obama being the president is  a testimonial to how racist the country is. 
[02:40:30]  Wow.  I'll tell you, listen to me, because he's not black.  He's not Compton black.  He's not Bronx black.  He's a fucking African who was raised by white people, but he's black only by his color.  Because Africa accepts him as their own.  Right.  Africa doesn't look at him like he's a black American.  They look at him as a first generation.  That's what you should see him.  I wish I was here when DL was here.  They get on the news and they go, you, we look at you. 
[02:41:00]  Look at you niggers.  You, you've been here 50 generations and you've done nothing.  We think you are president.  Filthy fucking Africans.  And, but the reason he's black is cause of his color, not because of what he's been through.  And, and that's how, that's why this country is so fucked up.  Are you shitting me?  Have you read his fucking book?  That's why.  Have you, have you, have you listened to his speeches? 
[02:41:30]  The experience of being his skin color makes him black in this country.  That's what I'm saying.  This country is so racist that just because you're skin color and you're fucking not white,  but you embrace white, you, you're white cause of your skin color, but not really cause of who you are.  You're not from whiteness.  What am I fucking wearing my, uh, pants around my ass and fucking bling?  Yeah, but I could say that you, you know, that you squingele and fucking blee blee blee blee. 
[02:42:00]  And you fucking steal fucking this.  And you shake, and you shake down this and shake down that.  I'm not a fucking Aryan, but I'm, I'm, you know.  Anthony may not be white, but his hood is.  You're a hundred percent Italian, Anthony.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  And Italians have nothing to do with whiteness.  You're, you're more black.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  Hey, listen.  You're trying to make the whole planet black.  No, I'm not.  Fucking Arabs are black.  Nappy headed negro.  Arabs are black.  Stop it.  That's what?  They're Arabs.  All right, here's the thing.  They're Arabs. 
[02:42:30]  Why don't you give Arabs Jesus like you should?  Well, I think we have.  I think we pretty much.  No, you haven't.  No, you haven't.  No one's giving.  Why won't the Catholics give.  You can't take down all those crosses in church and fucking spray paint.  Why won't the Catholics.  Get the stain out.  It's easy.  Just fucking paint over it.  Why won't the Catholics give Arabs Jesus in the least?  Why?  I don't know.  They fucking.  Because they're racist.  They got used to the white guy.  White is right.  That's why.  It's a racist country.  Just stop.  Sorry that the made up fucking fairy tale of Jesus, the guy isn't fucking white. 
[02:43:00]  He is a real human being.  How do you know?  Oh, okay.  So when he looks like Saddam Hussein, he's a figment.  Well, he looks like Rob Seeger.  He looks like Ted Nugent.  He's a fucking, he's an actual existing human being, right?  That's what I'm saying.  Just stop.  All we want to do is have you admit that there is racism.  See, the thing is, it's hard to talk to you because you're an admitted racist. 
[02:43:30]  I just want the disproportionate amount of crime to stop.  That's all I want.  How much crime can black people actually commit?  I want to be able to relate to black people more.  We don't commit that fucking much crime.  I want to be able to relate to black people more.  There's only a few people.  There's such a different culture that I can't relate.  You don't want to relate.  No, I can't relate.  If I went to a party.  You don't even have black friends.  You don't have black friends.  Let me say something.  If I went to some fucking house party where hip-hop's fucking blaring and guys, girls 
[02:44:00]  fucking dancing, shit like that, I would be so fucking out of place.  Not out of hatred.  Okay, so if I came out of your house and it's just a bunch of quiet white boys playing poker.  You know white people better than I know black people.  But that's what I'm saying.  It's the same thing.  I'll go over your house and it'll be you and fucking Danny and somebody else drinking  and being dead serious playing poker.  And I'm like, where's the bitches and where's the music?  You fucking losers.  But that's your thing. 
[02:44:30]  That's your thing.  Yeah.  And the women will be wherever the fuck they are.  So we're doing coke at the pool and you guys will be fucking drinking beer.  And I'll be like, can somebody have fun?  That's what I'm saying.  It's not like, you know, there's pit bulls.  And fucking dice going on at my fucking house if there's a party.  That's what I picture.  Norton's been at my fucking house.  You should have fun.  Like, black parties are always fun because you know when it's over when someone comes  in with a machine gun and clears the fucking place out. 
[02:45:00]  And Norton always leaves my house when all the black people come exactly on time.  If I say three, it'll be all the white people there at three.  Yeah, yeah.  And then at five, all the black people come.  And Norton has a way to leave at 5.15.  Oh, really?  I usually have spots.  But once I start noticing, like, I've never done a show with him.  I've never done a show with him.  If I don't know if they're fucking comics or crips, I fucking go.  Will you just stop?  Stop.  I am stopped. 
[02:45:30]  Stop.  What am I doing?  I am stopped.  Just stop your fucking, just buy your guns and fucking stop.  What do I do?  I keep to myself.  Stop vilifying black people, man.  I keep to myself.  You know, I am very, we are so, we are, we are really, we really love this country.  We've done nothing but good things for this country, man.  Stop about the peanut.  Compared.  Hey, guess what?  Hold the fuck up.  Stop the presses.  Uh-oh.  What?  I didn't realize this. 
[02:46:00]  I'm not going to like this.  Wait a second.  Uh-oh.  I'm going to have to have a fact every day.  All right.  I'm going to call in with a new black fact.  Jack Johnson invented the monkey wrench.  All right.  There you go.  Let me fuck it.  Jesus.  Jack Johnson.  Why would you play into this thing?  Why would you give everybody that?  Someone said, whose wrench is this?  Oh, my God.  Why would you do that?  He used to.  You're smart for that, Patrice.  He used to.  Oh, what is wrong with you?  He used to.  He used to tighten screws with his hands. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  And he couldn't tighten it.  Yeah.  That's kind of hard to do.  So he created the patent for the monkey wrench.  He didn't actually do that.  He got the patent.  He did not create.  He got the patent.  He got the patent.  Yeah.  And then Elvis stole it from him.  Yeah.  He didn't.  He actually did not create that.  I don't know if that's right or wrong.  He's talking about.  He's lying.  But I wanted to show you how he didn't know who was right or wrong here.  He created the patent.  All right.  Can we agree on.  Someone stole it.  Can we agree that we like porn stars?  Because we got one waiting to come in here. 
[02:47:00]  So we're going to take a break and talk to Gina Lynn, a friend of the show.  I'm stopping.  Will you stop?  You're an influential man.  No.  Stop having people afraid of black folks.  We don't do anything.  I don't.  What?  Never done anything.  Well, not you.  Not any of us.  Disproportionate number.  Disproportionate in jail, not disproportionate in criminal crimes.  Disproportionate.  I will say, the same black people that terrorize Harlem is terrorizing black people. 
[02:47:30]  Look, I'll admit it's, well, yeah, there's a lot of black on black.  And there's only a few motherfuckers who are terrorists.  A lot of black on black crime.  But.  And we get that from Africans.  But.  We get that from Africans.  Oh, I know.  They're constantly hacking each other up with machetes.  We're fucking genocidal maniacs.  I'm not attached to Africans.  They're insane over there.  I've never had anything done to me by a black person.  Of course not.  Hey, one punch to the other face.  You was almost raped, right?  You're almost raped.  You're almost raped.  Thank God, you know, he decided I was a man instead of a woman.  And I got punched on a basketball court and knocked out a cold. 
[02:48:00]  Which is.  You don't.  You didn't.  But see, you're an athlete.  Anthony's not an athlete.  He doesn't have.  You've never been.  You've never had personal contact.  That's another thing.  Yeah.  Non-athletic people should never be racist.  Because you've never had that personal contact.  And that mano a mano.  And you've never stood side by side with somebody of a different race.  And had to do something for the better cause.  You've never had synergy with a black person.  And you should get that.  I think I have with you. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  It ends right at 11, though.  Stop with that shit.  We're like that fucking.  It gives us gray radio at 11.  You don't even know he's alive.  That punch the clock when they're done.  Yeah, exactly.  That's exactly what that relationship is.  See you in the morning, friend.  Patrice, my story's simple.  Because I picked a sport where a lot of black people, you know, they play it.  And you're not in.  We talk shit.  And it's stupid to say they don't, right?  And I wasn't talking shit.  He was on my team.  And you've heard the story.  He shot a three-pointer. 
[02:49:00]  Beautiful.  And I turned to him and I called him the N-word.  Because that's what everyone on the court was saying.  But you said it accurately pointing.  No, I didn't.  I was naive.  You said three-pointer, nigger.  What?  I go, nice shot.  Because everyone else was doing it.  Nice shot, nigger.  But I learned the lesson.  Like, you know, I guess I was wrong.  Was you his friend or you just was on his team?  I thought we were friends, sure.  And I got knocked the fuck out.  That was an unfair knockout, I will say.  I'm on your side.  I was out.  That was an unfair knockout. 
[02:49:30]  Well, you know, I didn't start hitting black people.  I figured, wow, I got to learn something here.  I got to stop watching First 48.  I got to stop watching that goddamn show.  I mean, I'm scared.  And the web surfing, Anthony.  I think every middle of a white guy is a fucking...  It's going to tie you up.  The web surfing, Anthony.  That's true, Ant.  That is true.  What?  You don't go to a very good website.  That is true.  I go to all kinds of websites.  I go to the black extremist websites.  They're crazy, too.  The black extremist?  Which ones?  The ones with the Israelites, where fucking white sucks, and this one. 
[02:50:00]  They're reasonable.  Yeah, we...  Reasonable.  Israelites are a lot more reasonable than...  But, Patrice, I had to educate myself after that.  I was like, wow, why the fuck would he turn on me like that?  Well, because he's like that.  I was checking out David Duke's website yesterday.  He does hate Jews a lot more than he hates black people.  I think Jews are high up.  Because I think they're high up because...  As far as...  I don't think white supremacists respect black people as much as they respect Jews.  Oh, my God.  They hate...  Jews are number one.  White supremacists hate. 
[02:50:30]  Jews are number one, by the way.  I got to go to my bank.  They hate...  What?  ...Jews.  Yeah.  They consider them like the antichrist.  The whole...  It goes a lot deeper.  I think they have a lot more respect.  I think in terms of black people, they hate us in a very...  You should be our pets kind of way.  And, you know...  Yeah, they just see it as like the white man's burden kind of thing.  And, uh...  But Jews, they look at it as...  Jews are like...  ...run the world or whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They actually think they are spawn of Satan.  Ain't that a bitch.  Man.  I got a tinkle.  Watch this market collapse. 
[02:51:00]  It's fucking horrible.  Citibank, uh...  Just announced, uh...  That...  Has the market had one up day since Obama's been in?  Dude, hear me out.  It's breaking news.  Citibank, uh...  The government's going to own 36% of Citibank.  Is that bad or good?  Under the new rescue plan.  Oh, boy.  Watch this market collapse.  Now, this is almost socialism and, uh...  Communism, basically.  But is it Obama's fault?  That's breaking news.  Well, Obama is...  This was nice and set up before this motherfucker got out.  Obama's very, uh...  Socialist.  I don't know what the fuck Bush was looking at. 
[02:51:30]  He was...  He was busy.  This stuff was on the horizon.  Yeah, he was busy.  Raising oil prices.  Yeah.  And he stole about a good $75 billion before he got the fuck out of here.  Nice...  Nice robbery.  Yeah, he just took off, man.  He was like...  Raised the oil prices to about $5 billion.  $5,500.  Bam.  Now it's back down to $1.50.  And we got raped for, like, a good three months.  And we don't know why.  And it's like, wow.  It's back down to $1.50.  That's strange.  He saw that he had to have seen this coming.  And he did nothing. 
[02:52:00]  Bush.  He didn't give a fuck.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll get Gina...  Gina Lynn in here.  And also, Bobo!  In the audience, baby!  Oh, yeah.  David and Bobo going down today.  The David and Bobo show.  Right, Sam?  Yeah!  I think we're going to pop him on the radio right around 11, a little before 11, somewhere  around there.  It's going to be great.  For another 15-minute radio show with David and Bobo.  Stick around for that.  Opie and Anthony.  Nah.  Happy birthday to you. 
[02:52:30]  You can join in any time.  Happy birthday to you.  Happy birthday, dear...  Anyone?  Anyone know?  Um, Hitler.  No!  My birthday was this morning.  Happy birthday to Big Ken in Philly!  Oh!  My father-in-law.  I mean, we're buds, but...  It's hard to be excited about that. 
[02:53:00]  Brown nose!  I know.  These guys have wonderful timing.  It's hard to get everyone to sing happy birthday to my father-in-law.  As I'm trying to get everyone pumped for Big Ken's big...  And it's a big birthday for Big Ken.  It was one of the big ones, you know.  Was it?  Which one?  The 5-0.  Oh, the 5-0.  I don't know if he wants people knowing that, but...  That's pretty goddamn funny.  But a big happy birthday to Big Ken from the Philly crew.  Sure he's very happy that you're right on his tail as far as age goes.  Please, I got... 
[02:53:30]  What do I got?  I got like 12.  Three years?  12.  He's got 12 on me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  Gina Lynn, how are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Did you hear what happened?  No.  What happened?  We're like bad boys when it comes to porn stars.  Well, who do we have in?  We've got to tell her the story.  And we were...  And I swear to God...  Penthouse girl.  That girl from Penthouse.  The Penthouse girl.  What's her name?  Stupid Shauna Linnae.  What's her name?  Shauna Linnae.  Shauna Linnae or something like that?  But I don't know who she is.  Shauna Linnae or something? 
[02:54:00]  She's a crybaby.  Yeah, she ran out...  But she's not a big-time name, so...  No.  She ran out of here crying, and then she made a little YouTube video trashing us, and to  be honest with you, we were very nice to her.  All we did that she kind of had some kind of problem with, we put a couple of pictures  up, we found on Google, of her, and it was just a lot of cum on her face.  And she seemed to have a problem with that.  But it's like...  You know, most of us girls, we like to have the most beautiful pictures, but when you do 
[02:54:30]  a search on us girls, the most nastiest pictures come up.  Yeah, but you know what it is?  It's just the way it happens.  There's both, though.  There's really hot pictures, and, you know, those are the cum shots.  No.  There's really hot pictures, where you're looking all glamorous.  Can I say something?  There's the sex part.  Yeah.  We all know that's out there.  I mean, why not say it, right?  Of course.  Are you trying to interject here?  Can I say something?  Certainly, sir.  I'm here to promote myself as a boxer, so I don't want to see any black cocks on my  forehead.  All right. 
[02:55:00]  Are you boxing for real, bro?  Yeah, for real.  Yeah?  Where are you?  Boxing?  He's behind that monitor.  Where is he?  There he is.  You're an MMA guy.  I don't even see him.  You're an MMA guy, right?  Don't you do a...  Wait, you've been on our show.  He looks like one.  You've been on our show.  Yeah, with her.  Yeah.  I know.  I didn't know you were a boxer.  No, I'm doing the Celebrity Boxing Federation.  Oh, nice.  All right.  Oh, I'm fighting Jervis Peterson from Survivor.  With your dick?  Why are you so fucking familiar?  I know.  I know you're from somewhere.  Was you guys on a show where it was like 20 porn stars being... 
[02:55:30]  Take pictures and they did this?  Yeah.  You guys want it together, right?  Oh, the book of...  What is it called?  Thinking XXX.  Yeah.  And then, okay.  And then HBO picked it up.  You guys are married.  You've been married a long time.  Ten years.  And you're not in the game, though.  Wow, you hear how she said that?  You're not a porn star.  You are a porn star.  Yes, he is.  Which ones do you do?  He told a great story on our show.  It was him, right?  We have so many great stories.  Do you work with my hero, Nacho?  No.  Or Russell. 
[02:56:00]  He's booted out of the country.  He's booted out of the country.  He can't come back in.  Nacho can't come back in here.  Nachos kick out of the country.  What did he do wrong?  Fucking young bros.  I don't know.  It had to be really bad.  Do you think about him doing the, like, she-mails?  No, no, no.  I like...  Because that's what he does.  He got bored.  All Nacho do is fucking over there for you.  I didn't realize that until a lot later, but he did one called The Cast, where he just  was...  A great one called The Cast.  No, he's a good fucker.  And Rocco, him, Rocco, I like them.  But, um, do you ever do any scenes with black dudes? 
[02:56:30]  You do with, like, not together.  Jesus Christ.  Easy.  He does not do scenes with black dudes.  Black dudes, gang gangers, that shit.  Or a girl with a black, with your black friends.  There was a movie called Gina Lynn's Dark Side, Me, Lexington Steel.  Lexington Steel.  So, he's, Lexington is the black, is the white, white woman and white guy to prove black  guy in porno.  Yeah.  He's the one that they will do.  But he's, like, got a fucking massive cock, right? 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, but he's, he's kind of like how, um...  Yeah.  As opposed to small?  It's, like, 12 to 14.  Like, Justin, Justin, they want a lot of white women, want to do Justin, uh, Slayer.  No?  Or, like, uh, Wesley Pipes.  Why is that Wesley Pipes?  I think, I think they want to do a lot of white women.  Jesus Christ.  Are you serious with that name?  Ah, yeah, it's kind of weird, man.  Sleep tight.  Sleep tight.  Sleep tight.  Byron Long.  You like Justin Slayer?  He's improved.  He's improved.  He's one of my favorite dudes, man.  He, he, he fucks the girls I want to, I want to... 
[02:57:30]  He improved.  He, he left, uh, one company and went to Evil Angel.  And then, ever since he's been with Evil Angel, this stuff is, like, uh, technically improved.  As soon as you go to Evil Angel, you're, like, cold.  Well, his, just the, the, the, the shooting.  You're, you're, you're more, you're porn star-ish.

I moved to Ginger, really.  I forgot we was on the radio.  Yeah, he's like, you do black guys?  Uh, I know. 
[02:58:00]  Ginger, Ginger Lynn.  Did you just call me Ginger?  Ginger?  Ginger Lynn is porn star-ish, where she's, um, she's kind of like, uh, Jenna Jameson,  in, in which, like, it's, it's normal.  You do, like, you do stories still?  No, I don't do stories.  I'm a gonzo girl.  And, in fact, for the interracial.  You wasn't always a gonzo girl, right?  No, I was under contract, but I was one of the first contract girls that did the big interracial  scene. 
[02:58:30]  And then, all these big companies started following me, putting all these, like, pretty  contract girls doing interracial, because they were following me, because it was big.  Very, very rare.  I do like J.J., uh, what's J, J, J?  Jules Jordan.  That's what I said, Jules Jordan video.  Oh, you used to be a Jules Jordan girl.

Oh, she'll hit a girl in the head with raw meat.  She's a fucking monster.

He actually looks better now.  He looks a lot of weight.  He looks like an uncooked roast.  Hey, you know what?  I fucked him because he was able to keep his cock hard the whole time and get excited. 
[03:01:00]  What, some of these guys can't keep it hard the whole time when they're filming?  What's wrong with them?  Yeah, it sucks.  Chrissy Moon is another first-timer who gets railed by Travis, which is you?  Yeah.  You're railing her?  Railed.  Let's see here.  Railed.  Madeline is a, ooh, too many white girls.  Who is a fucking bitch?  Who is like a Chinese bitch or something?  What's the wrong with this racial porno shit?  Hey, I shoot plenty of Asian girls.  Have you really?  Yeah.  Have you done the delicious squirter? 
[03:01:30]  What's her name there?  Scytheria?  No, not Scytheria.  You guys blurt these names out like it's the fucking Academy Awards.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  Cruz.  Natalia Cruz?  No, the Chinese girl that's known for squirting.  Annie Cruz.  I have no idea who she is.  You don't know who the fuck Annie Cruz is.  What's Tokyo Hoes?  My goodness.  She must be a beat.  How about the lovely Jay Fire?  Don't say you don't know who Jay Fire is.  I know her name.  You never met her, though. 
[03:02:00]  Well, tell us who these people are.  That's true.  Jay Fire is an expert.  Let's go.  She's a black girl who does white girl things.  She's moved it.  Usually black girls stay.  What do you mean by white girl things?  White girl movies.  On time for the shoots.  Which is on time.  And she does, usually black girls aren't into fetishy shit things.  She does squirting.  She does bondage.  Well, you can't choose whether you squirt or not.  It just happens.  Not really.  These girls are fucking controlled. 
[03:02:30]  Something's going on.  How do you know?  You're not them.  I fucking, because I work, I know natural squirting.  You know how to make a girl squirt?  Oh, I'm a fucking genius.  How do you do that?  Well, you fucking press on the G spot.  It's very simple.  No, that's not how you do it.  That's how I fucking do it.  So I must be damaging bitches.  She must be peeing.  Yeah, I think she's peeing.  No, she's not peeing.  I don't know.  She probably is, though.  She's probably like this dude.  I'm not even going to.  She's probably like this dude's making me raw.  I'm just going to piss on her.  I know to piss me. 
[03:03:00]  She's trying to make you feel really good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's right here.  Yeah, that's all right.  All right.  Sorry.  I'm doing that.  I'm sweating.  Fuck everybody.  I know what's going on here.  Yeah, dear.  Well, that's pretty good.  Well, let's talk to April.  I mean, how'd you get into the business?  You just decided to go in.  She's not in the business.  She's not.  It was a one-time thing.  So this is it.  One and done.  That's what a lot of people say.  So what do you do?  Right, Gina? 
[03:03:30]  Well, I have known them for a long time.  And they had asked me several times to do things, and I was kind of shy about it.  Where do we meet you at?  We met at the gym many years ago.  Really?  And I was kind of in a restricted relationship, and I really wanted to do it, but I couldn't.  But you might as well now, right?  Well, I did it to kind of get it out of my system.  It's like one of those fantasy things.  We're waiting for her car payment to be due.  What do you do for a living, then? 
[03:04:00]  I have a professional career.  You work in an office?  Nice and mysterious.  Not an office, no.  No, no.  Cancer?  What?  Cancer?  No.  She has a very good professional career that cannot be talked about.  Dominatrix?  No.  Look out girl for bank robbers?  What the fuck?  A mainstream professional career.  She's a professional squirter.  I'm going to go with an airline pilot or something.  Not anymore.  It was teaching.  You can't be teaching.  Yeah.  How come you can't talk about it? 
[03:04:30]  You're on the video box.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe you don't want to miss.  Sometimes we don't use our real names.  Yeah, April, but how about disguising your face?  Yeah.  I see you.  Well, people know what she...  That's okay.  People know you.  There's somebody that's...  Wow, this is very mysterious.  They have.  A couple people have brought it up at my job, and I just kind of didn't blow it off.  She got put on probation for a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  I got in a little bit of trouble for it.  Can we guess what you do?  Oh, law enforcement.  Oh, she's a cop.  Something in law enforcement, right?  Are you a nurse? 
[03:05:00]  No.  All right.  Lawyer?  Anesthesiologist?  Even if you get this, you're going to say no.  She's just going to say no.  How about, can you say what kind of a building?  Not a hospital, but is it...  Do you wear a suit to work?  I dress professional.  Professional?  Yeah.  All right.  You a tap dancer?  Yes.  Yes, that's it.  I'm a big Gregory Hines fan.  Oh, you're in the media.  No. 
[03:05:30]  No, fuck.  April likes girls.  I think April likes girls more than I do.  Gynecologist?  No.  I wish.  Yeah.  Perfect profession.  Who doesn't?  Yeah, sure.  I mean, anytime I'm out with her, she's just like eyeballing all kinds of chicks.  You know, I kind of like dudes a little bit more than girls.  I'm very sexually attracted to women.  I love them.  Beautiful.  Yuck.  Boy, hearing this is so ew.  I know.  Mothersome.  Oh, sarcastic Anthony. 
[03:06:00]  Why, you were in this restricted relationship, and what happened?  Whoa.  I got out of it.  How long was it?  I don't know Bam got into porn.  Bam didn't do the porn, Bam.  I just got there.  He just linked his name?  No, he was there, and he directed his guy, Skeeters, that did some porn with us.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's an awesome movie.  That seems fun, directing a porno for a scene.  Bam goes Gina.  Shot in HD.  That's nice.  Everybody's so quiet. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, my God.  We're trying to figure out what she does.  I'll tell you why.  I think I realized, you realize something, like, the idea, you realize you think, like,  porn, from being in here, that girls in the sex industry have the personalities of dead  ants.  Like, it's, you figure, it makes me sick.  I'm getting fed up.  You figure, like, they'd just be like, yeah, this and that, and it's just like, am I watching 
[03:07:00]  a dick in a ass, and I can't get something?  It's just bothersome.  Yeah, you're getting...  I just realized that.  You're getting impatient.  It really, it's just, it's just...  Well, what do you want from these girls?  Nothing from them.  It's fine.  It's just, you just, it's an illusion that you just go,  You know, why not just get a girl who doesn't say she fucks for a living, but she fucks 
[03:07:30]  for fun, and she's just...  Wild?  Some wild fun fucker, as opposed to, this is just, like, this is, I jerk off to this.  So what are you getting at?  Give me something.  Give me something.  She's racing like a car.  I'm asking you a question.  Not you, not you, and I don't want to get, I just, it just, I don't even, I just, I'm  just, I'm just sorry.  I really am.  I just, because I'm a fan of porn. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, of course.  But it's almost like...  These guys have given us...  It's almost like meeting Steven Spielberg.  You go, I love Jaws.  And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this whole Bruce thing, I know.  Wow, Spielberg, what the fuck happened?  I'm a fan of porn.  I really am.  Could you elaborate a little?  And I just want to watch it and pretend, like, when I'm pretending at home to beat off.  Right.  I'm beating off, I'm real, but I'm pretend, it's like, you pretend like this is, wow, this 
[03:08:30]  is some crazy girl who, it's like, what is the magic?  It's like, I'm getting fed up.  Let's talk about it.  Let's get into this a little bit.  Oh, this is a crazy girl that is not trying to get into the porn world.  She just wanted to have sex with me.  He's not talking about it.  It's not even you.  No, it's not you.  It's not you.  It's not you.  It's just in general, this is why when you said, that's why I'm saying this, because when  you said it got quiet, that's what, the last time I was here, it's just like, girls, the  whole, you have to say dancing instead of stripping, and you have to, and I don't, and not you. 
[03:09:00]  I don't feel stars to the porn star.  Yeah, it's like, I'm not dancing around where, it's like, what the fuck?  Like, I want to, I want to talk fucking.  Yeah, I'm a dirty, I'm a dirty whore.  I'm a fucking dirty whore.  Let's get over it.  Let's get over it.  We're going to give you what you want right now.  No, no, it's not, not you.  Patrice wants you to blow his friend Jimmy.  But you know what? 
[03:09:30]  You know what, Jim?  That's what, it's like, okay, give us the rules, because, okay, we're joking, but yeah,  blow my friend Jimmy.  Like, not, but, every porn star is, like, that girl shot, whatever, crying.  Yeah, she is.  Bitch, you got the dicks in your mouth on TV, what the fuck you talking about?  Not everybody's like, there's, I know what you're saying, because there's a lot of girls  that think, because now they're on box covers and magazine covers, they're like, ooh, like,  I'm not that porn whore anymore, I'm somebody special. 
[03:10:00]  I mean, there are a lot of girls like that, but not everybody's like that.  I know, I'm generalizing, but most of the girls that I've ever seen in the game, where  it's like, it's just, like.  Well, you brought in, you've talked to the wrong girls.  Fair enough.  Fair.  But it's just like, I don't know if it was you, or, I think it was you, Gia, where you  go, wow, it's quiet, because.  I was bored.  Give me some input.  It's like, but you know, you're here with your husband, so as a dude.  See, that's what I'm saying.  This is not the.  No, but I'm not here, I'm not here as a husband. 
[03:10:30]  My husband is the ultimate pimp.  She fucks other girls, she fucks other guys.  Yeah, and I film him fucking other girls, and he films me fucking other guys.  But it's still, as a square dude, which I am, and I'm not a porno guy, I'm a square  guy, I'm just a square guy who likes porn, you're still here with your man, and so, you  can't, there's a dude thing.  So, it's like, okay, here's how it works, you tell me that story, or you tell me the  respect story, or this, or April, which is like, why, I'm looking at your asshole, and 
[03:11:00]  you're lying.  No, her asshole's not showing on there.  Oh, no, yeah, on, uh, I'm sorry, on Fresh B-Fried.  I don't think your asshole's showing.  It's just like.  Neither one of our assholes.  At least give us, like, a hint, because we'd be in, like, it's like, what do you do?  You know, it's like, no, I can't.  But you're on, you're in a porno.  But see, you're talking about your fantasies, and how you can't, you know, how porn is just  a fantasy for you.  For me, that was my fantasy, that was one of my sexual releases to do that, something 
[03:11:30]  I could have never done.  But I actually had the chance to do it, and that's why I did it.  That's just a fantasy.  Alright.  Makes me feel better?  Fuck it.  This is why I wish I was Count Dracula.  Yeah.  I wish I could live forever, just to see young bitches wear, when they're 80.  Hey, I brought you guys some clothes. 
[03:12:00]  That'll kill a couple of days.  Huh?  Yeah, just.  No, we have our own clothing company.  I got one for you.  Two stores, and a website.  I don't think that's going to fit that.  Who's medium?  Oh, I don't know.  My medium is a good one for Patrice.  I like this one.  What does it say?  It says free ones.  Thanks.  Who's large?  Your large?  Thank you, sir.  Dude, it doesn't, let me ask you a question.  Is it, is it, your wife does porn, you do porn?  Yeah.  It doesn't, because I'm so insecure sexually, it doesn't bother you, like, just, like, to 
[03:12:30]  think of her having sex with another, you've obviously seen it, you've filmed it, but it  doesn't ever make you insecure, if she was fucking a guy like Nacho, or Rocco, who are  like guys that really know how to fuck.  Dude.  Even in porn standards, those guys know how to fuck well.  Hey, I'm human.  It's just something that I've learned to block out.  I've never been, like, a jealous type of guy, but when we first got into the porn industry,  I used to just do her, she just did other girls, and then I started doing other girls. 
[03:13:00]  So, I pretty much talked her into working with other guys so I wouldn't feel so bad  that I was, like, fucking all these other girls.  And at first it did bother me, but it's just something that, we have a strong backbone in  our relationship.  Which one got to you, though?  Like, which one, was it Lex, or which one did you go, like, gosh, she's really enjoying  this.  Maybe the hockey player guys did other.  Oh, boy.  No, no.  It's, I don't think anybody really, it's the guys that are disrespectful. 
[03:13:30]  Like, we go to work, we do what we do.  Yeah, but that's different.  I like what Jimmy's trying to do here.  Like, everyone has, everyone has jealousy, right?  He knows.  Everyone has jealousy, so, like, if you guys, if you guys see each other fucking other people  and that doesn't really bother you, what makes you guys jealous as a couple?  When you say you're being a married couple, like, what really gets to you?  I think it's more offset.  I think one time he heard me give an interview, and I said I was doing a magazine shoot, and 
[03:14:00]  this guy actually made me come, and it was during a magazine shoot where...  No, no, he made you squirt, and I never made her squirt, so I was like, fuck.  He's never made me squirt.  I said, so I said, like, why don't you show me how you make you squirt?  I don't know.  It just happened.  But that made you jealous?  It did make me jealous.  I didn't even know my body did that.  I kind of felt weird, like, you know.  All right, Gina, what makes you, what does it take to get you jealous as far as your husband  goes?  I don't know.  It's been on and off.  It's certain girls.  I think it's more girls that I don't like. 
[03:14:30]  If he's working with a girl that I don't like and approve, and especially,  if it's, like, a skanky girl that he has to work with.  I think it's more girls that you get jealous that seem to have a...  Like, we've been on set before.  Girls are like, we've got to hang out after, like, go out sometime.  Right.  And then they don't realize that we're not swingers.  Oh, yeah.  And they kind of, like, they kind of cross over.  So your rules for off-camera stuff are your exclusive.  Right.  No off-camera fucking with other people.  Oh.  Okay.  And this...  And I got to ask this, and no disrespect, but porn star, what... 
[03:15:00]  You said skanky girls.  Like, a lot of guys would go, wow, porn stars are skanky, and I don't mean to be disrespectful.  No, there's different levels of girls in the porn industry.  Yeah, explain that, because I...  There's A-list girls, B-C, and there's, like, nasty girls.  So there's porn stars that looked at some of these other girls like, what a fucking skank.  What makes them a skank?  I don't know.  They're just...  They're dirty.  They're not as pretty, and they will do whatever the fuck it takes to, you know, get paid for a scene. 
[03:15:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So you, like, wait, so off...  Now, you guys consider cheating...  But Travis likes the skanky girls.  So that pisses me off.  So there's a jealousy thing.  Well, you consider cheating the same as anybody else considers cheating, though.  Like, if you sleep with a girl off...  That's not on the clock, say, she would freak out on you as much...  Which is my girlfriend what I mean.  I have...  She hooks...  She hooks me up with girls...  She brings girls.  I have not brought girls home.  When we're in Vegas, or we've been on other trips, somehow it's happened where we're all having fun, we're drinking, 
[03:16:00]  and a hot fucking chick comes back to our room, and we hang out for a while, and Travis ends up doing it.  I do her.  But, you know, I keep saying he owes me.  He owes me.  So if a guy's disrespectful to her, do you feel like...  Do they tap into that thing, like, I'm a man, I should be protecting her, but I can't protect her right now?  Well, no.  What do you mean, on set?  Yeah, like, there's guys that I know that are on girls' nose list because they just like to hurt the girls, they like to fuck them harder than they need to. 
[03:16:30]  No, I like that.  Because this is how I feel.  We got into this as a profession.  Let's fucking do it right and make it good.  I always tell her, do a raunchy scene, be nasty.  What bothers me is when we go on set, and we're sitting there in the waiting room, and this guy comes up and goes,  Hi, Gina, I'm working with you today, and then he's trying to, like, all, like, massage your kisser neck.  Be all lovey with me.  Be like, oh, wow, it's like I've been such a fan of yours for so long, and I'll, like, I mean, keep that to yourself. 
[03:17:00]  I can turn on and off as soon as the scene starts.  It's, I don't even have to talk to my co-stars at all beforehand.  Just look at their test, then go on set, and then I can turn right on and just do my, like, sexual performance.  But doesn't it, for a woman, it's a little different, though, because the guy, you can falsely lubricate.  We can't falsely, I mean, again, without the, without the cabaret.  I have to find the chemistry with the girl.  I mean, and sometimes when there's that chemistry, I just got to put myself in that place, because if, you know, I've worked with chicks before, and they're like, oh, my God, like, let's quarter after, let's do 45 minutes. 
[03:17:30]  And you kind of think, like, man, like, at least act like you, like, suck in my dick, because it's not easy, you know?  And when I go on set with strange guys, I don't try to, I try to be nice to them and don't act like I don't like them, even if I'm not attracted to them whatsoever.  I try to just, like, work it so I can get through the scene and get it done quick.  So you, uh, what, does, now I get obsessed if I know a girl that I'm fucking has fucked guys with a lot bigger dicks.  That worries me, because I can't, like, I can give head well, but I can't make that happen. 
[03:18:00]  So does that fucking bug you, or because you're in that, like, category, you don't give a shit?  It doesn't bother, if that bothered me, I wouldn't be able to do porn.  You know, like, I did a scene with her with Lexington Steel.  If I worried about that, I wouldn't have been able to walk out on set, you know what I mean?  Lex, Travis.  Yeah, this guy's twice the size of me, you know?  Is he really?  Yeah, he's 14 inches.  No, well, I, I, I dispute that, maybe, like, 12 and a half. 
[03:18:30]  Jesus.  But still, you know what I mean?  When this guy pulls it out, flopped it on the table, and I'm like, oh, shit.  Did you want to just go look, forget the contract, here's your money, go on?  Well, Ron Jeremy, Ron Jeremy's a big dude.  I had to do a scene with a guy with Ron Jeremy, and Ron Jeremy pulls out this big, fat thing,  and the thing is, I came in, Ron couldn't stay hard, and I fucking blew the scene, like,  if it wouldn't have been for me, the scene would have sucked.  Right.  Because I was, you know, I did what I had to do, and then Ron's like, oh, well, if I lean 
[03:19:00]  back a little bit and pull my gut back, then you'd be able to see my dick more, and it's  like, and meanwhile, I'm just fucking the girl, and I'm like, whatever, dude, you know, don't  rub your hairy chest on me.  What do you do if your dick's not working?  Oh, he told the story.  Well, yeah, there was.  Injections and shit.  Remember that story?  Yeah, yeah.  It was insane.  You know, I've taken Viagra before, but it's, the whole Viagra thing, I took it one time,  because I had to do two scenes in one day, and I felt like I was going to shit myself  on set. 
[03:19:30]  That would be great.  I had no control.  So I was just like, wow, man, it's like, so.  What a way to end the scene.  Yeah, it's like, it's a money shot.  Hold on, I think I'm going to fart.  Oh, shit, I'm sorry.  So what was the story you had about, you dropped an N-bomb, you know, he said,  you know, he said it to his friend, he said, that's my nigger, and you said it.  When did you say that he shouldn't have?  Well, all right, my dad's a missionary.  I was raised in Alaska.  I never really hung out with, you know, the African Americans, black people, whatever. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  I came down to Pennsylvania, got a job in a lumberyard, and we're all sitting in the  lunchroom one time, and these guys are like, we've got to take you out.  I was really naive.  I didn't know clubs or anything.  We've got to take you out, but I like the rap and the breakdance, and I thought that  was really cool stuff.  So one guy says to me, he goes, did you ever fuck a sister?  And, like, I didn't know, and I just said, what do you mean?  And I said, the N-word. 
[03:20:30]  And he came across the table and started choking me, and two of my other buddies pulled him  off.  Wow.  And I was just like, seriously, I didn't know what the fuck I did wrong.  I had no idea.  But that's, you know, I learned.  Oh, shit.  They taught me.  I was, you know.  He's schooled.  Yeah.  He's schooled by that.  So, all right.  That's very interesting.  To the next topic.  Well, no, I'd like to know about the jealousy thing, because I get fucking so freaked out  by a girl. 
[03:21:00]  Let me tell you, yeah, but you know what, that's not even it, because I have a lot of  friends that are just, a lot of people always ask me this, your girl's with you, if she  wanted to be with somebody that was a bigger dick, she'd be with them.  I think you've got to just appreciate that she's with you and loves you and not worry  about that shit.  Yeah, I know.  It's an insecurity, and it's not, it doesn't, it's going to, it doesn't hurt anybody else  but you.  I, I, I look at women, and I think that they view men the way we view them.  So, it's like, uh, my girlfriend's like, no, I like fucking you, I don't want to fuck 
[03:21:30]  anybody else.  And I'm like, I know you do.  Like, I send her pictures of other guys, like, I know you want to fuck them.  Like, I just, I'm taunting her, I'm a fucking, I'm a crazy person.  Yeah.  You really send pictures?  Well, yeah, we talk dirty about her fucking other people, which I kind of like.  Right.  And I'll challenge her to.  So you pick a specific person that you think she wants to fuck?  I'm just out of my mind.  I didn't say it was healthy.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Well, you know.  How is it so quiet?  Yeah, that's kind of crazy. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  You're feeding, you're feeding your.  It's almost like I like, my therapist told me that I like to, you know, we all like to  avoid hurt, but we figure it's going to come, so that's a way of controlling it and making  it happen so you have some element of control.  When I masturbate, I, it's really weird, but I think of him cheating on me.  Like, it's a little humiliation.  And like, like almost walking into it, but it turns me on and it just gets my thing going  a little bit more.  But, she caught me jerking off one time and fucking lost it. 
[03:22:30]  To a nasty girl.  She was disgusting.  I had a.  You're fucking earning your ass in a picture.  That was gross and she's not even hot.  And he was masturbating to the picture.  At least fucking jerk off to a hot fucking girl.  I was editing.  I was editing on my computer.  Yeah.  And he was like, oh, I was going through a bunch of pictures.  Oh, shit.  I was editing.  I had it on the computer, me fucking earning the ass, and I'm, I thought she was in the 
[03:23:00]  shower.  I had the lube.  Now that I, when I'm in the shower, I'm like, Travis, I'm coming out now.  Please stop jerking off.  I had a bottle of lube sitting there on my desk and paper towel, you know.  I'm looking at this shit.  I didn't even start.  I was just like, you know, just kind of stroking a little bit.  I'm like, fuck.  He wasn't full force.  This is a good scene.  It's good to know even four stars jerk off.  I got my dick hanging out.  Next thing you know, like, I didn't even hear her.  She walks up.  She goes, what are you doing?  I'm like, oh, shit.  I'm like, uh, let's get ready to jerk off. 
[03:23:30]  I didn't think it was that big of a deal.  She fucking lost.  She goes, why are you jerking off to her?  I think I punched him in the face.  It was a girl.  Wow.  No.  Why?  You fucked her?  Yeah, why?  Yeah.  Daniel Derrick.  I don't know her.  Yeah.  Put it this way.  I shot her two times.  The first time I was really sick and she liked anal.  She's dating a cop in New York trying to hide it.  One of those things.  And she walked off the set.  She goes, that was nothing.  That was easy.  But I was really sick.  So I was like, all right, I want to rebook you in two weeks. 
[03:24:00]  And then HBO came down to do a documentary.  No bullshit.  My guys had to carry her and put her in her car.  I fucked her shit up.  Like, her ass was so fucked up.  Because in my head, I was like, all right, you know, you think it's that easy.  And then I just got this craziness.  They hit the fucking cat here.  Like, the old man in clockwork.  And then she did to ass to mouth.  I had to edit through the whole scene because it was for Gene Allen Productions.  And I'm going through the scenes.  And I see, like, him pulling out of her ass. 
[03:24:30]  And there was all kinds of stuff.  And then sucking on his cock.  And, like, shit all over her mouth from her own ass.  Did she really have fucking, uh...  Because she leaked all over the place.  Really?  Wow.  It was kind of sick but hot.  And I go, this is what you were jerking off to?  And is this girl up here on the screen?  That's her?  Yeah, that's her.  What a trooper she is, though.  The boobs are a little weird.  Yeah, they are a little odd.  Oh, you know what?  The only reason Travis...  You know what? I don't know if I should say this, but... 
[03:25:00]  The only reason Travis was jerking off to her is because he got to fuck her in the ass  because he can never fuck me in the ass.  Oh, you know what?  Yeah, and that's true.  That's true.  She won't do anal, so...  Oh, shit.  It was a picture of him, like, plowing her in the ass that he was jerking off to.  Travis, you said, I don't know if I want to say this, but...  Yeah, I'm going to say it.  Because this girl was one of the...  I'm fucking this girl in the ass, and I'm, like, smacking her in the ass.  I'm being really rough.  I'm squeezing her ass cheeks, and her one ass cheek fucking shot off to the side. 
[03:25:30]  And it freaked me out.  I'm like, whoa, what the fuck?  She goes, oh, I got ass implants.  And she really didn't have an ass anyway.  Holy shit.  She didn't really have much of an ass, so I was shocked that she told me she had ass implants.  I'm like, man, I can only imagine what you had.  Oh, yeah.  See?  See?  It moves over.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, man.  She does.  She's got, like, ass implants.  And it was still a tiny little ass with the implants.  Oh, yeah.  You see that asshole right there?  That shit was three times that big.  I was upset that he was jerking off to that. 
[03:26:00]  You never an ass cape, did you, Travis?  Good boy.  When I shot my load in her ass, and then I pulled out and waited for it to run out,  and when it ran out, it was, like, cream shit, cream shit.  It was, like...  A parfait.  I've seen a lot of nasty stuff, but I was kind of, like, little dry heaves and shit.  But that's still what you jerked off to.  Yeah.  Hey, would you ever do a scene with Max Hardcore?  No.  No?  No.  All right.  No.  He's in jail.  Is he in jail?  I know he got convicted in Tampa, but is he actually in jail? 
[03:26:30]  I think they got it, like, two weeks ago.  He surrendered.  Does that worry you, too?  Yeah, it does.  You know, because it's kind of...  There's so much other bullshit in this world that they should be worried about instead of stuff like that.  I mean, if you don't want to watch that kind of stuff, don't buy it, you know?  What was the obscenity conviction for?  What scene?  Max does...  Max puts speculums and pussies and...  You don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  I...  Just don't say anything.  Yeah, I don't know the exact...  But they try to get the people for the squirting and the pissing on one another and stuff like that, you know, so... 
[03:27:00]  Good, clean fun.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break here.  We're running out of show.  What, by the way, are you guys promoting?  We got to get to David and Bobo.  Free ones.

No, it's actually a really big thing. 
[03:28:00]  Two black entourages.  Um...  Thank you.  I had higher hopes for that one, too.  I didn't expect you.  All right.  Uh, you can get tickets, uh, 800-677-8499.  And that's April, uh...  April 3rd, Travis Lee Boxing.  Um, the guy from Survivor.  I hate that show, so I fucking hope you really hurt him.  He will hurt him.  He'll kill him.  All right.  Very good.  Hey, I want to make sure I get your contact so I can send you some, uh, good, uh, interracial  shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm into this shit. 
[03:28:30]  You got really quiet.  You got really quiet.  Like, your feelings got hurt, and you got really quiet.  My feelings didn't get hurt all the time.  I was quiet because I didn't want to hurt nobody's feelings.  You're not going to hurt nobody's feelings.  No, but...  I will.  And the thing is, I don't even want to...  I don't even want to...  It's...  I'm telling you.  Just...  I'm not even...  It's not even like, oh...  I'm just saying...  You might get happier after you see my girl's ass.  I'm...  I'm happy now.  This is...  This is just niggas shit.  I gotta explain to white people how I feel. 
[03:29:00]  This is my ping pong.  I'm okay.  Have you ever gone on freeones.com?  There's so many different girls and affiliate programs that you go on.  That's not what...  Well, we know.  Let's go to commercial.  It's all good.  Listen.  I have one question about Lex.  I hear Lex is pretty, uh, pretty traditional sexually.  No...  No ass or any of that stuff.  Won't eat ass and that stuff.  He ain't my pussy.  Well, yeah.  That's why I said ass.  Uh, and I think he kind of licked up in there.  Oh, did he?  Okay.  Like a smooth lick.  Yeah, here he's pretty, like, pretty fucking, uh, pretty straight-laced for a porn dude.  I don't know about that. 
[03:29:30]  Okay.  All right.  Patrice is going to be at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey tonight and tomorrow.  Uh, we're all going to be at Comics tonight.  14th and, uh, what?  9th Avenue?  14th and 9th Avenue for the funniest listener.  It starts at, like, 7...  Yeah.  ...30.  And just don't offer Anthony home remedies and don't fucking see E-Rock and yell,  Hey, fat E-Rock.  Right.  It's only going to embarrass him and make him feel bad about it.  We're going to have a good time down there tonight.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we get back, it's, uh, the Dave and Bobo Show, everybody.  The second installment of the Dave and Bobo Show. 
[03:30:00]  Uh, a quick 15-minute little radio show from these guys.  Stay there.  The Dave and Bobo Show.  The Dave and Bobo Show.  This is unbelievable.  I cannot believe they are giving you valuable fucking airtime.  It's like a topic to fucking talk to the guy about it.  I could do a hell of a lot better job than you, sir, David.  You think you could?  Anyone could.  It's the Dave and Bobo Show.  If you don't shut up, I'll proceed to hang up on you.  And the Bobo Show.  This is the Dave and Bobo Show.  All right. 
[03:30:30]  Good, uh, good, uh, midday or afternoon, whatever it is.  I guess middle between morning and afternoon.  Well, this is the Dave and Bobo Show.  Yo, yo, what's up, man?  Dave and Bobo Show, Friday afternoon.  How's it going, guys?  Bobo, what's up, man?  How you doing today?  Everything's going great.  Everything's going great, David.  Yeah, yeah?  You excited for the big weekend coming up?  Yeah, excited for the big weekend.  Got any big plans this weekend? 
[03:31:00]  No, this weekend, unfortunately, there's not really much planning this weekend.  No?  All right, man.  But we got a lot of stuff going on in the world.  Actually, you were bringing up one interesting topic that you were talking about just a minute ago.  We were doing some prep, Bobo.  What was this topic you were bringing up about some woman in England wanting to televise her death?  What's going on, Bobo?  Why don't you explain this to the fans?  No one knows about this.  I never heard about it.  Explain.  Well, there's some broad, some English broad that was on the English version of the show Big Brother. 
[03:31:30]  Right.  She's very terminally ill.  Like, she's pretty much definitely going to die.  It's inevitable.  Okay.  And she wants to document the end of her life on a reality show overseas.  Really?  Yeah, the end of her life.  She wants to document it.  What are your thoughts about this?  Do you agree with this?  Do you think she should do it?  Do you think people would want to watch this?  What do you think?  Give me your opinions on this.  Well, I have to...  Please. 
[03:32:00]  Alright.  Now back to you, Bobo.  Well, I have to admit that this is going to be interesting seeing this.  Someone documenting the end of her life.  Well, what the...  Really seeing the stuff that's going to happen.  I definitely agree.  That's crazy stuff.  I mean, if she's live on TV, they're just going to be focusing on her on her deathbed,  just sitting there and watching what happens to her?  Well, she's going to document this stuff.  Well, I guess basically it's going to go like...  I don't know how, but they're going to be following her life, her last days of life,  whatever she does. 
[03:32:30]  What do you think about that in terms of like...  Do you think that a lot of people would be offended or a lot of people would want to watch this?  Do you think it's going to get a good view, like ratings?  What do you think?  I think a lot of people are going to watch this.  You do?  Okay, hold on there for a minute, Bobo.  We're going to go to some callers right now.  We've got Will online, too.  Yo, Will, what's up, man?  Hello?  Yo, David.  Hey, David.  What's up, Will?  What do you think about this lady dying, David?  What do you think, David?  What do you think about this lady dying when she dies?  How is she going to die when she dies? 
[03:33:00]  I don't know how she's going to...  Oh, man.  What do you think, David?  What do you think, David?  Bobo, what do you think, Bobo?  Bobo.  Who are you asking?  Are you asking me or are you asking Bobo?  Me, what I think...  I'm asking you, you fucking retard.  Watch you.  Okay.  Bobo, yes.  What I think, if she wants to do that, I say go ahead.  That's what you say, Bobo?  Okay, great.  The number to call is 866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[03:33:30]  You got there, Bobo?  Yeah, I'm there.  All right, cool.  So, the point of this topic is that I really do not think this will go over well.  I don't see a lot of fans, or even fans of Big Brother, like, I mean, they might have  known her from Big Brother, and they might have wanted to watch, they might have enjoyed  her on the show.  But in terms of televising your death live on national TV, I think that's a bit too much.  I don't think a lot of people will turn on and watch that.  You really want to see someone just sitting there, rotting, dying, like being sick, or  whatever they're doing, and you think a lot of people want to, like, see that on the 
[03:34:00]  air?  I don't think it's going to go over well at all, Bobo.  That's just my thoughts.  Well, I'm not sure if I'd want to watch it, but I'm sure there'd be whatever sick  ass there are would probably want to watch it.  There are a lot of sick people in the world, aren't there, Bobo?  Yeah, there are.  Hey, I've seen people that like to get their asses kicked by their own girlfriend.  Right, but they don't televise that shit on air, do they?  No, but heck, that would make excellent TV, though.  You think so?  You think a lot of people would watch that?  Just some girl kicking the shit out of a guy? 
[03:34:30]  You think someone would watch that?  Yeah, take argument to the next level.  All right there, hold on a minute there, Bobo.  We've got Tom on line nine.  Tom, what's up, man?  Hello, Tom, you're on.  Yeah, it might be nice to say Tom in Chicago.  I said Tom on line nine.  Tom, you're on the air, I said.  Have a fucking opinion of your own.  Every three seconds, you're asking Bobo what he thinks about it.  What do you think about it?  I just said what I thought about it.  I said I think it's a horrible idea, and then no one's going to watch that darn show, 
[03:35:00]  and it's going to be a failure, and I don't want to see someone rotting in a bed dying.  I said that.  That was my opinion, okay?  You asshole, I said that.  How am I a moron?  How am I a moron?  I gave my fucking opinion on the show, on the air, on the show about what I think about it.  How am I a moron?  Because you have no fucking opinion about anything.  I do not have an opinion.  I gave my opinion about what was going on in the...  Were you dropped as a child, David?  What the hell is wrong with you?  I gave my opinion about what I thought about that show not doing well and no one watching it, all right? 
[03:35:30]  Why don't you go suck a dick, Fats, though, okay?  I gave my opinion about the show, and now I'm asking Bobo about it because it's his story.  He researched, and he brought it up.  It's his topic, and I'm learning about it from Bobo for the first time, all right?  Then have a conversation about it.  I am having a conversation about it.  I'm asking him about it.  I gave my opinion about it.  You want to come here and pick a topic and do a story about it?  Do you?  Hello?  That's right.  You hung up.  Good for you. 
[03:36:00]  By the way, we should acknowledge that we are on two countries, U.S. and Canada, and I think parts of Mexico,  but unfortunately, they don't have the Alaska thing that they covered.  So sorry, Ms. Palin.  No, no, no except for you.  That's right.  All right.  So basically, it's basically like I was an asshole that call, and I think that I personally did give my opinion.  I think that show will bomb and will be horrible. 
[03:36:30]  You got anything else on your mind there, Bobo?  Anything else you'd like to bring up besides that story?  Well, I would like to bring up that spring training has just started.  Spring training?  That's baseball you're talking about there, right, Bobo?  Yep, that's right.  I see you with the Mets at.  You're a big Mets fan there, aren't you, Bobo?  Yeah, of course.  As I said before, I mean, you've been a huge Mets fan for years.  All right.  Hang on there a minute, Bobo.  We've got another caller on the line.  I'd like to give his voice.  We've got Mike on line four.  Yo, Mike, what's up, man?  Hey, Bobo, you should drop this snick-bick barbarian.  Hey, yeah, David. 
[03:37:00]  Let the Schwartz be with you, you Jew.  All right.  That's not very funny at all.  Not one bit.  Continue, Bobo, with your Mets spring training.  Well, yeah, it is the start of spring training, and I'm hoping I don't have to deal with the second year of a collapse in a row.  Right.  That is true.  What are your opinions on the Mets?  I hear you're a big Mets fan.  I see you're always wearing that Mets cap.  You a big supporter of the Mets there?  Yeah, I have.  I've been a big supporter since I was a kid, and yes, I am excited about the upcoming season. 
[03:37:30]  What are you excited about there for?  Do you have a certain, like, fan of the Mets, or like a certain player that you like on the Mets?  Are you a big fan of, like, David Wright or maybe Elgato?  Who's your favorite Mets?  My favorite Mets has been David Wright.  David Wright.  What do you like about David Wright?  I think he's a good third baseman.  He can get hits for power.  He can hit a lot of home runs.  What do you think about him?  Yeah, exactly.  I love the way the guy shows his enthusiasm playing on the team and being there on the field.  All right, hang on there a minute, Bobo.  We got another caller on the line.  We got James on line six.  James, hello.  You're on the air. 
[03:38:00]  David?  Yes.  What's up, man?  Will you please do me a favor?  Depends what it is.  Get the fuck off of my radio.  Please.  Please.  Who is it to you?  Who are you to tell me what to do?  Um, well, just like O&A, just like everybody else, I could do your show better than you.  Oh, sure.  So why don't you come here and do it right now, then?  Excuse me.  I'm in fucking Kentucky.  So drive over here.  Drive over here and come do a show.  Holy shit.  Well, hey, let me ask you something. 
[03:38:30]  See, I called the other day.  Are you there?  I'm listening to you, jackass.  Listen to me.  I called the other day, and it was about you fucking with some chick on the internet.  Yes.  So what's going to happen whenever that guy comes and confronts you?  Are you going to, like, hang up on him, too, you pussy motherfucker?  What the fuck are you talking about?  That guy's not going to...  That guy...  That guy was just here last week.  Yes, that's right, Bob.  Well, we saw him.  He didn't confront me at all.  He didn't give a shit about me messing with his wife. 
[03:39:00]  We were just messing...  We were just flirting, and it was a joke.  Oh, was it?  What the hell is that noise in the background, you asshole?  My child.  You know, I've gotten pussy, so I have a child, you know?  Good for you.  Mom cares about your children.  You would never get...  Hey.  Hey.  Yes.  I hope you die of AIDS.  Good for you, man.  Good for you, man.  I could do this all day long.  I'm sure you could.  Great.  Yes, I could. 
[03:39:30]  Good for you.  You're dumber than the motherfucker in front of me that can't go on a green light.  You don't shut up, man.  I'll shit in your fucking mouth, you dipshit.  Oh, man.  So, Bobo, you were talking about the Mets there, weren't you?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's right.  I was talking about them.  All right.  But I think that's enough talk about the Mets for now, because we got some guests around  here on the show.  We got to introduce our big guests that we've been having the whole day. 
[03:40:00]  Why don't you give a little shout out to the guests there, Bobo?  All right, we got a Gina Lynn, and she's got a clothing line called a Skinpa.  If you go to SkinPA.com, you can see my clothing line.  Good try, Bobo.  You see one of my models here?  Yeah, I see one of your models.  Hi, April. 
[03:40:30]  Hi.  Good talk, Bobo.  Do you have any questions?  Do you have any questions?  How did you get into the industry, anyway?  Well, the clothing line is not porn, but getting into the industry was a long time ago, dancing,  but everybody knows that.  Yeah, I know, but how did you come up with the idea for the clothing line?  Um, I actually modeled for them for eight years, so the, like, silhouette on a girl. 
[03:41:00]  I don't know if you've ever seen a silhouette.  You ever seen one before, Bobo?  Yeah, it has, like, my boobs like that.  Whoa, Bobo, what do you think of a wall?  How about that?  That's a nice set.  Do you want to see her set, too?  I don't know, Bobo.  Ask her.  Show the goods.  Show the goods.  Stand up.  Okay.  Look.  Right?  Wow, Bobo, what do you think about that?  That's pretty good there, huh?  Yeah, it's pretty nice.  Yeah, it's a nice set.  What would you like to do with that, Bobo?  If you had, what would you like to do with that? 
[03:41:30]  Oh, I'd like to go right between those, if you know what I mean.  Come on, Bobo.  Come right between us.  Wait.  Read that.  Read that.  Read that card, Bobo.  Read that card that I just gave you.  I'll read it.  Let me see some, let me see them titties.  I think Bobo would like to see them.  He's very excited right now at the moment.  Whoa, there he goes!  Whoa!  What? 
[03:42:00]  Describe what you're doing.  Okay, okay.  Right now, the two of the models we've got going on,  over here are taking their clothes off.  Bobo's getting a little anxious here.  He took his glasses off, even.  And he's going and running up to them,  in between them.  Now he's bending down here, sitting on the chair.  Yeah, take the hat.  I think you can take the hat off there, Bobo.  Take the hat off there, Bobo.  Right and ready.  You put the mic up.  Whoa!  Holy smokes!  Try them right between them.  For those of you fans that are not here and can't see,  the stars are just rubbing their tits on Bobo's face. 
[03:42:30]  Roll up in there, in his face there, Bobo.  Yep, that's right.  He's running away.  Yep, that's right.  Yeah, Bobo, why are you running away?  Are you scared?  Don't go away.  They're not done.  They've got a couple more minutes to go, Bobo.  All right, they're all done.  They're right between them.  And damn, that feels great.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Whoa!  They are rubbing their tits right in the face of Bobo.  Wow.  Wow, Bobo, how does this feel to you, Bobo?  Describe this experience, please. 
[03:43:00]  Are you kidding?  It feels great.  Have you ever had any tits rubbed on your face before like this?  Ever?  Is this your first time?  What are you...  Uh, yeah, yeah, that's pretty much the first time.  Wow, wow.  What do you think about it?  Do you think you'll want to do this some more,  try to feel this experience again?  Of course, yeah.  Wow, that's incredible, Bobo.  I can't believe it.  Hold on for one minute.  We've got another caller on the line.  It's Mark on line four.  Yo, Mark, what's up, man?  You're on the air.  Hey, uh, hey, David, what are you doing, David?  David, what do you think about those tits, David? 
[03:43:30]  Hey, David, David, do you like hearing your name over and over again, David?  Yes, I do like hearing my name over again, actually.  That's...  I appreciate that.  You're doing great.  But, David, can you...  I'm trying to explain for the...  You're not trying to make a conversation, David?  I'm not trying to make a conversation.  I'm trying...  I'm trying to say something, David.  Just say something.  You know what?  Fuck you, mother asshole.  I'm not trying to explain...  I'm not trying to make a conversation.  I'm trying to explain to the listeners that are not here at the studio  what exactly is going on now,  what these stars, the porn stars, are doing to Volvo,  because no one can see this.  I'm trying to give a visual explanation so everyone can see that.  You got a problem with that? 
[03:44:00]  Do you?  Hello?  Hello?  Are you there?  Oh, I forgot that guy.  Forget that guy.  Continue.  Proceed.  Proceed, I meant to say.  Yes.  Thank you, Danny.  What I was saying is that, yeah, these guys, these guys,  these broads tits, they can wake up to dead with their tits.  Maybe your friend want to, like, switch seats with you.  Hey, you want to switch seats? 
[03:44:30]  Come on, come on, it's great.  Switch seats.  Yeah?  Should I?  Yeah, all right.  All right, definitely.  Definitely, I'll switch seats.  Now, you, now, Bobo, you got to explain what's going on to me, Bobo,  and you, you, you explain, and you ask me the questions now.  Bobo, is that a hard one you got there?  Of course.  Sorry.  I didn't know someone.  That was great.  All right, now. 
[03:45:00]  All right, Bobo, explain.  All right, she, she's a, the, the, she, he's a right between them.  All right.  Bobo, continue, continue.  His glasses are purple.  Bobo, you got to direct the scene, Bobo.  You tell, you know, how about this, Bobo, you say what you want those stars to do to  me.  You give them orders, Bobo.  How about that?  Bobo's going to give them orders.  We're going to do a little more.  Can we take your glasses off?  Whoa, Bobo, explain what's going on.  They're making out right now.  All right.  They're making out right in front of him. 
[03:45:30]  Okay.  What are we doing?  Tell us what to do.  Bobo, tell them what to do, and they'll do it.  Now, you two make out right in front of him, and then go ahead and feel free to remove  the glasses.  Oh, me.  That's me you're telling.  Okay.  All right.  Whoa.  Explain, Bobo.  You're commentating.  They're making out right now.  Now, you two go remove the glasses.  Okay.  Well, you know what it is.  You guys just do what he says.  Relax.  Okay.  I'll hold your mic. 
[03:46:00]  I'll hold your free mic for you.  All right.  Sounds good.  Now, feel free to let him motorboat your rack at the same time.  Okay.  Whatever you say.  He's motorboating them.  He's a better director.  Yes.  He's motorboating them.  Oh.  We've got to do the whole smush thingy.  Bobo, you explain what they're doing.  Right now, they're like climbing on them right now as we speak.  They're climbing on them right now.  You ready to motorboat?  Yep.  Go. 
[03:46:30]  The motorboat at the same time.  The chair looks like it's almost falling.  Bobo, explain.  That sucks as a motorboat.  I know.  It was bad.  It was bad.  It was one of the time.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  He's really getting it.  He's really getting it.  He's getting it.  Okay.  Right now.  Turn around?  Now Gina's taking her.  That's our turn.  All right.  All right.  Now, you two go ahead and grab.  Come on, Biatch.  Go ahead and grab his dick. 
[03:47:00]  Come on, go ahead and grab his dick.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Grab his dick.  Both of you at the same time.  Oh, okay.  All right.  He's giving the orders.  All right.  Let us grab his thigh.  Yeah, I think that would be better.  Right there.  Right there.  Okay.  Now grab his dick.  No, no, no.  I don't know where it's at.  I think it's right here. 
[03:47:30]  Wait a minute.  Let's see if I can find it.  Okay.  I think you two need a magnified glass to find it.  What?  What?  Come on, Bobo.  A magnifying glass.  That's a little harsh, don't you think?  A magnifying glass.  Oh.  I'm just playing with you.  You can't have to make it look big.  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  All right, Bobo.  Explain.  Keep going.  All right.  They're grabbing.  Yeah.  Go on, go on, go on.  At least they're trying to.  I'm trying to get you a little excited through your thighs, okay? 
[03:48:00]  I'm kidding.  Okay.  They're trying to get him to get to the feet.  I'm starting to get excited there, Bobo.  Lean back.  I'm going to grab your cock.  Let's make it a cock right now.
