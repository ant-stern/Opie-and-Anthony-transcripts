<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a caller, Marco, expressing homophobic resentment towards comedian Mario Cantone.  This devolved into a sexually charged and offensive conversation laden with homophobic slurs.  The show then transitioned to a phone interview with Dr. Smith, promoting "Golden Mood," which was met with awkward silences, uncomfortable questions about his past, and mockery from the hosts.  Following this, a bizarre and disturbing interview with a seemingly confused and disoriented Ronald Reagan ensued, marked by rambling comments about his health, Nancy Reagan, and his desire to die. The first act concluded with the hosts expressing strong anti-Arab sentiments and engaging in inflammatory and offensive rhetoric targeting specific ethnic groups, including Jews, particularly focusing on the treatment of Arab-Americans post-9/11.

The second segment started with a discussion about the ethics of Jewish lawyers representing Arab clients after 9/11, focusing on perceived anti-Semitism. This transitioned into a discussion of a protest in Dover, New Hampshire, by Kansas Baptists against a same-sex couple being named "best couple." The hosts discussed the hate speech and religious intolerance present at the protest. The conversation then shifted to the increasing human lifespan, with humorous, often graphic, speculation about aging, sex, and the declining attractiveness of older people.  This included a reference to a video of a 100-year-old woman engaging in sexual activity.  A caller, Tom, shared a tragic story about his grandparents' deaths during their 50th-anniversary trip, leading to a mix of shock, dark humor, and disbelief from the hosts.  The segment ended with a “Best Ass Contest” contestant, Patty, performing a poorly executed musical number on an electric guitar, accompanied by jokes and banter from the hosts and her friend, Reynolds.

The third segment detailed Opie's negative experience at a Midtown Manhattan hotel he called the "Crack Hotel," describing its poor condition and his discomfort.  This led to graphic descriptions of his soiled underwear and concerns about STDs.  A caller, Lester, discussed his struggles with financial aid due to immigration issues. Comedian Pablo Francisco performed a stand-up routine featuring movie trailer voiceovers and humorous observations about Latinos and drug use.  The segment concluded with Opie's ongoing feud with producer Al Dukes over a vintage pinball machine Opie intended to destroy, referencing previous instances of destroying gifts from disliked people, including a stalker.  The entire segment was filled with crude humor and explicit language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 W.A.W. New York  O.P. and for me  1027 W.A.W.  1027 W.A.W. 
[00:00:30]  So, what's up, Marco?  Well, I have a bone to pick with you.  Oh, could you put it another way?  Bone to pick.  I'm a little upset.  Yeah.  I haven't been on the show for a while.  Right.  I was feeling very slighted.  And since it's the new year, I decided maybe I'd make amends. 
[00:01:00]  Amends.  Well, maybe you would make amends.  You make amends.  So, what's the problem?  Why haven't you called in?  Well, maybe I'm blowing this all out of proportion, but I was feeling...  Blowing all out of proportion.  Notice the key phrases he used.  Amends.  Blowing out of proportion and pick a bone.  All right.  Go ahead, Marco.  Okay.  I was feeling very slighted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's like I've had a very tough year the past few months.  How are you slighted? 
[00:01:30]  What have we done?  Well, you are having that other guy on a lot.  That other guy.  The other gay gentleman.  What other gay gentleman do we, uh...  Mario Cantone!  Uh, well, Mario Cantone, he's a comedian.  Marco, I...  Yeah, and?  You know...  Am I getting this right?  Now, listen to me.  Is this guy jealous?  One gay character on the show is fine.  Two gay characters is an orgy.  But we don't bring Mario Cantone on our show for the gay character. 
[00:02:00]  We bring him on because he's funny.  He just happens to be gay as well.  Yeah.  Okay.  But then, every time he comes on...  You're not funny.  Comes on, another key phrase there.  Gotta watch.  He's doing code talk to the gay character.  Every time he comes on the show, Opie's like, we love Mario.  Oh, we love Mario.  He's jealous.  We love Mario.  Marco's friggin' jealous.  You're a jealous gay man.  Of course I am.  When I was young, I never need anyone. 
[00:02:30]  You're lonely, Marco?  Yes, I am.  I'm very hurt.  Making love is just for me.  Somebody else has taken your place on the Opie and Anthony show as the gay guy.  Do you feel like you don't have as many friends?  No.  Used to be you'd come in here and hang out with the guys.  Remember the time Jay Moore was in here whipping your ass with a party cropped and putting  a bullseye on your butt? 
[00:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  And then now you've just got to tune in and listen to Mario Cantone having fun with the  guys.  Oh, yeah.  Guys, you just have fun with.  Oh, he's so funny.  Remember the old days, Marco?  Hold on a second.  Now where are you?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now where are you, Marco?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't want to be all by myself.  You get nothing.  You lose. 
[00:03:30]  Good day, sir.  How about a nice bucket of eggs?  Sometimes I feel so insecure.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  I love some distance.  You're feeling insecure, Gay Marco?  Yes.  And you're really hurting my feelings.  Insecure.  Sorry, Marco.  I thought we were friends.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot? 
[00:04:00]  I don't want to be all by myself.  Howdy.  Faggot.  We got it.  We got it.  Oh, you're a girl.  I'll back for a topper.  What are you, gay?  Oh, who's all gooey?  I'm a friggin' fag.  You want to make out or something?  You want to make out? 
[00:04:30]  Marco, he's a comedian.  He's a funny guy.  You're, you're, you're Marco.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  So what do you think of my tight pants?  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[00:05:00]  Get your balls out.  Get your ass off.  I love that guy.  I love that guy.  Mario's hilarious.  Yeah.  Marco, you all right?  Yeah.  Audio of Marco after he hangs up. 
[00:05:30]  Don't you do it.  Don't.  Don't.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  Hey.  That guy's looking at him.  No. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Impossible.  Stay out of the bushes.  That's disgusting.  Impossible. 
[00:06:30]  That's a winner.  I'm gay.  I'm gay.  You've got some funky tasting stuff.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Got himself secured a little baggy.  Daddy, you're not lame.  I'm gay. 
[00:07:00]  Marco?  Yes?  Who else would we waste four minutes on like that?  Right.  I don't know, but you're obviously taking advantage of my fragile, delicate, emotional state right now.  At least that's fragile and delicate.  No parts of you that are pretty road-worn.  You all right?  You okay?  I'm fine.  We kind of need you as we move forward with the radio show.  Yeah.  Oh, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. 
[00:07:30]  We need our fag quota to be filled.  Well, then I think you need to do something to make it up to me.  What?  Like what?  Well, what kind of good prizes do you got?  Prizes?  You've never asked for a prize?  Let me look in the prize.  Well, you do have a contest, and I wonder what kind of prize you're giving away for.  What contest?  The virgin one?  The virgin contest.  Oh, God.  We're not doing the gay virgin contest. 
[00:08:00]  He could not possibly be a contestant anyway.  Right.  Please.  I'm a virgin!  Yeah.  This hour.  We've heard you tell your stories about when you go to Fire Island and whatnot and wait  outside the pizza shop.  The pizza place outside there.  Well, I've never been with a woman in that stance.  Oh, there you go.  You're not going to lose that virginity.  Like...  Okay.  No.  Don't worry. 
[00:08:30]  You're the favorite fag of the show.  Oh, thank you.  I feel so much better now.  Mario, funny guy.  Gay Marco, gay guy.  Right.  How's that?  That's endearing, right?  I guess so.  Everything else all right with you?  Yeah.  Could be better.  Could be worse.  Maybe someday if we have a bunch of roosters in here and we hold a cockfight, we can invite  you down.  Sounds good.  Sounds like something you might enjoy.  Well, you know, I was getting worse.  I thought I was going to have to join the rest of your castaways on the Ron and Fez show. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, there are a lot of our castaways.  We do have a lot of castaways that have joined the Ron and Fez show.  Set adrift.  And they found the island of Ron and Fez.  Well, yeah, we've noticed that as well there, Gay Marco.  Hold on.  Ivan wants to say something to you to help you out a little bit today.  Hey.  Hi.  How are you doing, guys?  Listen, I just want to let you know how much big fans we are at Mario Cantone.  We love him, man.  He's the best.  Bring him back.  Get rid of this guy. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, boy.  We'll set up with this guy.  Bye.  Let's go.  Give it up already.  All right.  Thank you, Ivan.  For some reason, he doesn't...  Marco?  Yes.  You all right?  I get lots of fan mail, you know.  People wonder where I've been very concerned about me.  Fan mail from some flounder?  Would you like to give out your email address?  Will that make you happy today?  Hey, Gay Marco.  AOL.com.  Hey, Gay Marco.  Anything else for today there, Marco?  No, I guess that's it.  My life goes on. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  I'm gay.  I'm gay, and it feels good.  I want to let you know I'm fine.  I'm alive and living my life.  Great.  Nothing's changed.  All right.  I still love you.  Even your T-cell count?  Hey!  Oh, God.  Damn.  That's awful.  That's really bad.  Well, he said nothing changed.  I'm just making sure.  All right, Marco.  Hey! 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, I'm right.  Almost called him Mario.  Oh, my God.  Almost called him Mario.  That was horrible.  Well, the first three letters are very simple.  Matter of fact, there's only one letter different in your names.  Mario and Marco.  But there's a world of difference between us.  This ought to get those Frisco numbers up, okay?  This break.  San Francisco's feeling this.  Well, I feel like we've cleared things up, and I'm feeling much better.  All right, so please give us a call when you have something of relevance to the show. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, geez, sure.  Like, this was irrelevant.  My emotional state.  Boy, going from hockey fights to gay Mario.  Next break, we go from civil rights discussions to the Klan.  Toss me a thought.  I'm used to it.  I bet you are.  Think of it this way.  At least this time you don't cut a sleep in the wet spot.  Hey!  How do you know that?  All right, Marco.  All right.  Bye, Rick.  I love you. 
[00:11:30]  It's on the AP.  Marco loves Rick.  Marco loves Rick.  Opie and Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  Dr. Smith's on the line. 
[00:12:00]  Dr. Smith?  Yes?  Oh, dear.  I'm not getting lost in space.  Hello?  Yes.  Young boy, yes.  William?  Hello, Dr. Smith?  Hello.  Hello!  How are you today?  Why don't you tell our listeners what you do?  I'm an osteopathic physician.  I do natural wellness in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
[00:12:30]  Yes, indeed you do.  You have a book out, do you?  No, not a book.  What do you have?  A product.  Woo!  A product?  Yes.  You're a doctor?  I sure am.  I am, too.  Dr. Smith?  You're a doctor of what?  I never really knew.  What type of doctor was I?  Yes.  A pediatrician?  Yes.  Gynecologist?  Oh, dear.  Spare me the poisonous bobs, Dr. Smith. 
[00:13:00]  Dr. Smith, do you know who Dr. Smith is?  I certainly do.  Yes.  What's your product, sir?  It's a mood product.  It's called Golden Mood.  Oh, Golden Mood?  Yes.  You sure you're not a dentist?  Because this is going to be like pulling teeth.  No, it's called Golden Mood.  It's for people who have the blues. 
[00:13:30]  Are you taking this product?  Yes, I am.  Oh, geez.  There's an endorsement.  Give some to Major West.  He's such a prick to me.  That was what?  I didn't catch that.  It says here, doctor, that more people die from medical mistakes each year than from highway accidents.  Is that statistically true?  Yes, it is.  Who cares?  Well, I don't get it, though.  Everything I've read that Rick has given us about you, Dr. Smith, has to do with medical-like mistakes and whatnot. 
[00:14:00]  But then, the first thing you mention is this product.  Yes.  Is it an antidepressant?  Pardon me?  Is it an antidepressant?  Look at Rick.  Rick is now going, oh, no, I'm so dead.  Is Golden Mood an antidepressant? 
[00:14:30]  It's more of a mood support product.  You could say that it has herbals in it that work as an antidepressant.  Big Kev, do you have a guest for us?  The guy in the suit, maybe?  Maybe the guy in the lost-in-space suit?  I probably could call him.  That was his name, May?  Bob May.  Bob May.  It says, are meds killing your sex drive?  Does this help with that, Golden Mood?  Help with your sex drive?  Yes.  This guy's killing our show.  Well, it won't kill your sex drive.  No, no, I'm saying because I've noticed that my sex drive has been down, and I'm trying 
[00:15:00]  to get substitute teaching jobs to get it going again.  No, I don't think it'll help with your sex drive.  Yeah.  So what does it do?  It's a mood support product for people who have problems with depression-type problems.  Rather than going on strong antidepressants, they can go on something a little mellower,  like the Golden Mood.  It's like a mild puffer. 
[00:15:30]  How does it work?  At the edge of the tree.  Yeah, I know.  I wasn't paying attention.  Dr. Smith, you sound depressed.  You sound like a robot.  You're on this product, and it doesn't seem to be perking you up.  It doesn't perk me up?  No.  No, Dr. Smith.  What medication are you taking, Dr. Smith?  I don't take any medications.  Aren't you taking your Golden Mood product?  Yes, I am.  Warning, warning.  This product increases boredom on radio programs. 
[00:16:00]  Warning, warning.  You have the energy of a rock.  Dr. Smith?  Yes, sir.  You know, our Dr. Smith used to do things where we wanted to leave him on a planet.  Right now, I'm thinking I want you on another planet.  Please, Dr. Smith, do something exciting.  I think I feel like I'm on another planet.  Back to the Jupiter, too. 
[00:16:30]  Dr. Smith?  Yes, sir.  You suck.  Thank you.  I mean, you're on a radio show.  It is a medium for speaking.  You drone on and on like a bloody answer from the planet Furiaton.  Warning, warning.  This is time.  We will never get back.  Dr. Smith.  Yes, sir.  Have you ever been on the radio before? 
[00:17:00]  Let's start there.  I sure have.  This is sort of a new experience.  Where's young William?  Have you slipped him a Mickey?  You have your own radio show.  I do.  Oh, even the robot's laughing.  Don't give anyone a radio show, huh?  Yeah, that's true.  If you pay some money, they'll give you one.  Ah, wobble doodle.  I understand.  Just like me, the grease man.  Warning.  Doug from Springfield wants to know if he's on the Zoloft from keeping from boring us all. 
[00:17:30]  Dr. Smith, do you realize you are not that exciting?  Absolutely.  I'm a pretty exciting guy.  I guess I'm slightly intimidated.  What do you do for excitement there, Doc?  What do I do?  Yeah.  Oh, go to theater and go skiing.  What kind of theater?  Go gambling.  I mean, we have some pretty nice theater stuff in Cincinnati.  A lot of the Broadway stuff comes here. 
[00:18:00]  We took a gamble on this booking and lost.  What was the last show you went to for fun?  Blast.  Did you have a blast at Blast?  It was a blast.  It was great.  I loved it.  Wow.  What a rousing endorsement for Blast.  It's no stump.  But it's better than the Blue Man Group.  And your ski?  A little bit.  Yeah, I have.  I haven't went.  Obviously, I haven't went yet this year. 
[00:18:30]  But I think probably in the spring I'll go.  Yeah, obviously.  Because we know all about you.  Right.  Obviously.  You failed to mention that in the last ten times we talked on the phone at home.  Were you around when Larry Flint got shot in Cincinnati?  No, I wasn't here then.  He did get shot there, though, right?  I don't know if he got shot in Cincinnati.  I know he's got some hustler stores here.  Ah.  In the area.  Pornography.  So how could you die from your medication?  From my medication?  Not your medication. 
[00:19:00]  Oh.  From medication.  Taking too many pills.  Wow, you are really breaking some ground with that statement.  Too bad you couldn't talk to Marilyn Monroe.  You idiot.  We could have saved Janice and Jimmy.  Holy S.  You could die if you take too many pills, kids.  Dr. Earl, is your product being sold successfully over the Internet,  or can people get it in stores?  It's sold over the phone. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, yeah?  It's mail order.  And how would one go about getting your product?  There's an 800 number they can call.  Oh, what's the 800 number?  888-248-6216.  Wonderful.  Wait, wait, what?  Dr. Smith.  Yes.  Dr. Smith, we were losing your communication.  Yeah, what happened when he wanted you to give out that 1-800 number for your product? 
[00:20:00]  What was that number again?  888-248-6216.  And this way, you will get the product.  Dr. Smith, are you there, Dr. Smith?  Yes, I am.  Is there a problem with your phone?  You must be calling on a cell phone.  Yeah, that's it.  I'm on a cell phone.  Yeah, okay.  Do I detect sarcasm?  My sensors pick up sarcasm, Dr. Smith. 
[00:20:30]  No, you wouldn't get any sarcasm from me.  That sounds sarcastic.  Are you a married fellow?  No, sir.  More surprises.  Ha, ha, ha.  Dr. Smith.  Do you have a boyfriend?  No, I don't.  Girlfriend?  Uh, not really.  Dating.  Dating what?  Girls.  Another robot?  Another robot?  Ha, ha, ha.  Do you slip her a Mickey? 
[00:21:00]  Ha, ha.  That's what you call it.  Very energetic.  Ugh.  You're as exciting as bone cancer.  Oh, hey.  How long has, uh, type of comment is that?  How long has, uh, Golden, um, Mood been, uh, on the market?  Probably about 30 days.  Who cares?  30 days? 
[00:21:30]  Are you selling a lot?  I really haven't checked yet.  I've just started doing radio interviews.  Because it says that you want to make, it's supposed to make people's mood better.  Is it a bottle with an old person falling down steps in it?  No, but that, that might work, I suppose.  It's for some people.  Oh, you ever see an old hip bone shatter?  Chews you right up.  What type of doctor are you?  Family practice.  Do you get to see the young ones naked?  Not anymore.  Why? 
[00:22:00]  Court border.  Since the court border.  Because of the court border.  I remember Dr. Smith used to like young William.  Is that correct, Dr. Smith?  You liked young Will Robinson.  How did you find that out?  You are a kid, Fetcher.  I saw the episodes, Dr. Smith.  Why would the Robinson family allow a pedophile to roam around foreign planets with Dr. Smith?  Hey, we got someone on the line that has tried the product. 
[00:22:30]  What is it called again, Doc?  Golden Mood.  Golden Mood.  Golden Mood.  Warning.  And you're on it, and it peps you up, right?  Absolutely.  There's a guy, his name's West Coast Dave.  He has tried your product.  We're in a lot of cities, sir.  So let's see what he thinks of the product.  West Coast Dave.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi.  I tried Dr. Smith's product, and it really, really pepped me up.  Last week, I went lawn bowling, and I find myself full of energy and pep, and I am able 
[00:23:00]  to enjoy life a lot better now.  Well, that's a rousing endorsement for Dr. Smith's product.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  A great degree.  I'm going to go throw myself off the Golden Gate Bridge now.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Well, Dave enjoys the product, Dr. Smith.  Well, I'm glad.  I'm glad to help Dave out.  Do you have any celebrity endorsements besides Kurt Cobain?  No.  No, I don't.  Can you imagine this guy off of the product? 
[00:23:30]  Is it possible I could melt those pills down for a golden shower?  What were you like off the medication, Dr. Smith?  I was boring.  God, you should be a Canadian.  That was funny.  All right.  Ah, wow.  All right.  Well, let me go to Alan here.  Alan.  Hello, Dr. Smith.  I have a serious question for you.  Yes. 
[00:24:00]  If I use this product, Golden Mood, will it ease my bum hole after anal?  A very serious question for you.  Will it ease your what hole?  My bum hole.  You know, Dr. Smith, the balloon knot, the back door, the rear entry.  Probably, absolutely.  Absolutely, it will help.  Wow.  Now, I'm excited about this product. 
[00:24:30]  Later, Kid Toucher.  Dr. Smith.  Well, Dr. Smith.  Yes.  So it'll ease the pain of the back door?  Absolutely.  Everything feels better.  Eli.  On Golden Mood.  Eli.  Yeah.  Oh, hey.  How are you guys doing?  Oh, good.  We're talking to Dr. Smith.  I have a problem, Dr. Smith.  I get down a lot and depressed, and sometimes the only thing that cheers me up is whacking  my girlfriend a couple of times.  If I take your product, if I take your product, will it help me out? 
[00:25:00]  It'll give you the stamina that you need.  Oh.  There you go.  No problem.  But, Doc, I think if you're beating up your wife, your girlfriend, you don't want stamina,  you idiot.  Georgia!  It's Georgia!  We have another call on the line?  Hi, who's this?  Hi, this is Mike Tyson.  Hey, Mike.  Hi, Dr. Smith?  Yeah, Mike.  Dr. Smith.  S-M-I-F.  I could spell that one. 
[00:25:30]  Dr. Smith, can I stop taking the Zoloft and go on this and still be in a mood where I  don't kill y'all?  Um, are you still on?  I would love to punch you in your face.  You still on your lithium, Mike?  I need the lithium and the Zoloft, and now the golden mood.  I would take, I would lay down, I would say, thank you, Dr. Smith, and I would take the  golden mood, right?  I would swallow it, I would wait until it takes effect, and then I put my big foot up 
[00:26:00]  your ass, is what I would do.  I would kick you so hard in your ass, that you would actually maybe even for a second  get a personality.  This is awful.  I don't know, it's pretty funny.  What made you get into, looking to pioneer golden mood, if I could?  What got me into natural wellness, or?  Natural wellness.  What is natural wellness?  I've never heard that term.  I just don't use medications in my practice anymore. 
[00:26:30]  It's all holistic.  It's all holistic.  Holistic medication.  Spirit, mind, and body.  But is that good for, like, tumors and stuff?  No, I mean, there's a place for medications.  Medications are important, and they work.  Just taking too many of them.  What would you give a tumor?  A tumor?  Yeah.  What kind of a tumor?  A malignant tumor? 
[00:27:00]  What kind of a malignant tumor?  You have the charisma of George Harrison today.  Sir, let's just say that my rods aren't what they used to be.  Your rods aren't what they used to be?  Yeah.  Can it help with the boners?  Why am I talking on this?  Can it help with the boners?  Can it help with the boners?  Probably Viagra.  Was that another joke?  Yeah.  Give him a laugh.  Oh. 
[00:27:30]  Doc, you're awful.  Wow.  I've got to tell you something.  What's up?  You are absolutely the worst radio guest we've ever had on this show.  We've been on the air together, Opie and I, for, I believe, seven some odd years.  Seven some odd years.  You are probably, and I'm not even being wacky, probably the most boring guy we've ever spoken to.  But you'll remember me.  I know. 
[00:28:00]  Because I'm the worst.  I've never been the best at anything.  True.  So I'll be the worst.  He'll probably, um...  But, Doc, if you're going to promote a product that's going to pep you up, shouldn't you go on the radio really peppy?  Do some cocaine or smoke some crack before you do these radio interviews.  You have the energy of a sloth.  Thank you, Vito.  You're working on anything else, holistic medicine, besides the golden, um...  Are you working on a personality?  Anything like that? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, I've got other products in the making.  I guess...  What do they do?  I guess I'm going to have to do some therapy or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, at least you could give out the phone number for 18th City.  So why don't you give out the phone number for the Golden Mood?  Okay, the Golden Mood phone number is 888-248.  Mm-hmm.  And we've got operators standing by? 
[00:29:00]  Absolutely.  Dr. Smith, I have to ask you something.  Sure.  You say you're a family practice?  Right.  Yet you don't prescribe any type of drugs?  Nope.  All right, can we play a game?  Absolutely.  What year was Dr. Smith's license taken away?  Can we play that?  And why?  And why?  And why?  Can we play?  Yeah, when did he get out of drug therapy?  Was that it?  Yeah, no.  You started dipping into the medicine cabinet yourself?  A little bit of the morphine.  Oh, need morphine.  I think there's a story with Dr. Smith. 
[00:29:30]  There's some kind of story because there's no family practice guy that doesn't prescribe the dope.  It was at the same time when I quit doing the pelvic exams on the women.  Oh, the pelvic exam.  The pelvic exam.  Was there some type of touching thing that happened?  It was the pedophile, the drug thing.  It was the whole thing.  It was so stressful.  It just all came together.  Yeah.  Dr. Smith, I'm being serious here.  There has to be a story why you're not prescribing drugs to people.  Did you ever prescribe drugs to people? 
[00:30:00]  Sure.  Yeah, I worked for 20 years.  20 years.  And then what happened?  Something happened.  Something happened.  What happened to change your outlook on medicine?  Well, I had to come up with one incident, I guess.  You know, you're probably right.  I lived in Branson, Missouri.  Uh-huh.  And my mom died from overuse of medication.  The wrong kind.  Sorry to hear that, Dr. Smith. 
[00:30:30]  Sorry.  I appreciate the symbol.  Wow, where's everyone going?  Over medication.  Jim is in a corner right now.  From over medication.  Right.  All right.  What was the drug of choice?  What was the drug of choice?  Like what was the ailment and what was prescribed and how did it happen?  Dear old mom.  It was just an anti-inflammatory.  You know, her stomach, she bled to death.  Sorry.  God, that's depressing. 
[00:31:00]  It wasn't you that prescribed it, though, right?  No, not at all.  Oh, okay.  Just because that would have been even more tragic.  Well, why was she taking the drug?  It was because of some kind of stomach.  Arthritis.  Arthritis, yeah.  Arthritis?  Right.  You said arthritis of the stomach?  No, arthritis.  Arthritis, and then she took an anti-inflammatory, and I guess she was over-medicated, and it  caused her stomach to bleed?  Mm-hmm.  Did it explode?  No, it wouldn't explode.  It would just kind of bleed open.  Yeah, it bleeds, yeah.  So did she get bloated and stuff?  No.  Why didn't anybody see this happening and maybe remediate about it? 
[00:31:30]  When it happens, it happens pretty quick.  Was it?  Yeah.  Well, what happens?  She just, she bled, and they tried to take her stomach out, and she died on the operating  table.  Wow.  Huh.  Jeez.  So, then you decided that medication was no good, right?  Huh? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  That kind of...  Bad medication.  That kind of put you over the line?  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Here's one for the old-timers.  You mean me?  Wow.  So that, then you went into holistic medicine.  How old were you when your mom died, if I may ask?  Forty-five, I'll say.  Forty-five.  Hey, screw this.  The wiffle ball back girl's here.  Oh, yeah?  All right, Dr. Smith, thank you so much.  Okay, buddy.  You want to give out that phone number once again?  No. 
[00:32:30]  Why wouldn't?  Hey, that's the funniest thing you've said.  Why wouldn't you want to give out the phone number?  I'm insulted.  Um, no.  What's the matter, Dr. Smith?  You okay?  It's like Linus in the football or something, you know?  It's like I'm going to be kicking the football.  Nope, I'm not going to do it.  Dr. Smith.  Oh, now you're going to make us feel bad.  No, no, no.  Give it out for the plug.  Give it out for the plug.  Hey, what's going on Wednesday over there with this wow thing?  Wow?  Wow. 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  I don't know anything about wow.  Oh, come on, guys.  You're more depressing than old yeller.  I just talked to a friend of mine in New York, and he told me that on Wednesdays, you guys  do a wow thing.  Really?  Yeah, whip them out Wednesday.  Girls like flash guys on the way home if you see wow in their car.  Yeah, like why couldn't you call me on Wednesday?  Maybe that would have put me in a better mood.  You're in a bad mood?  Why?  No, I'm not in a bad mood.  Did we get off to a bad start?  No, no.  No, I just don't.  Why don't you free your mind here?  Why don't you tell us what you think of us? 
[00:33:30]  You all right?  What do I think of you guys?  You all right?  You all right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're a lot of fun.  You sound a little...  It sounds like you're going to take a warm bath and slit your wrists after you hang up  the phone.  You have any friends, Dr. Smith?  Do I have any friends?  Yeah, you got any friends?  I think I got a couple.  That's good.  All right.  You get laid?  You said he's dating, Ope.  It hasn't been real recent I haven't gotten laid, no.  You want us to get you laid?  Out in New York?  Yeah.  You know. 
[00:34:00]  You made up that over-medicating story, right?  She died from boredom of one of your visits.  I'm not even a doctor.  You're not even?  You what?  I'm not even a doctor.  Then why are you Dr. Smith?  Well, I had to come up with something.  Hold the phone.  Wait, you're doing...  You said that you practiced 20 years and you were an emergency room doctor.  I know, but Dr. Smith couldn't take the call and he asked me to come in here and  sit and talk on the phone.  He said there were a couple of jerks from New York calling and he wanted to...  He said he's trying to be whacked.  I think you're lying, Dr. Smith. 
[00:34:30]  No, I'm not.  You're Dr. Smith.  No, no.  No, I'm not.  Dr. Smith would never have somebody else come on when he has something to talk about.  That's right.  He was busy and he just asked me to come on and sit here and...  I give you credit.  It's a good out.  I like it.  Okay.  I don't want people to think that you really are a bore because you want people to buy  your product.  I understand all that.  That's okay.  And then...  Kirksville College?  And the mom's death thing, pretty sad.  That was sad. 
[00:35:00]  Very sad.  I understand that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, thank you, Dr. Smith.  Okay, guys.  Good luck with the product.  You sure you don't want to give the number out again?  I really feel bad now.  And you know what?  Ant and I, we like to goof around, but when it's over and done with, we like to make good.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm just serious.  Okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Dr. Smith, you were a good sport.  You took our abuse.  You took everything we threw at you. 
[00:35:30]  You didn't hang up.  You hung in there.  You're a good guy.  So we got our fun out of you and now we should make good.  Okay.  You ready?  The phone number.  888...  888.  Right.  Go ahead.  I didn't do nothing yet.  248.  Right.  Dr. Smith?  Yes, sir? 
[00:36:00]  Do you want Mr. DVD's phone number?  You guys can have a blast together.  Very good.  All right.  Thank you, Dr. Smith.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There he goes.  There he is.  Our new pal, Dr. Smith.  Dr. Smith.  We better keep in touch with that guy.  I like him.  He's going to kill himself soon.  Woo!  Woo!  Party radio with Dr. Smith.  That was some of the most uncomfortable radio I've ever heard.  You actually left your seat and walked into the corner when Ovi played the canned laughter  over the monster. 
[00:36:30]  Oh.  That was probably the worst use of canned laughter I've ever, ever heard.  Wait.  Russ wants to say something.  Russ, what's up?  Man, I know you go for the cringe radio thing, but with the mom on the operating table and taking  out the stomach, oh, you're going to hell, guys.  You are all going straight to hell.  Thornton, you rule.  Thanks, man.  Later.  Okay. 
[00:37:00]  Goddamn.  Goddamn up-tempo number after a mom dying.  Linus and the football.  Linus and the football.  Very good analogy from the very boring Dr. Smith.  I'm not Dr. Smith.  Except it's Charlie Brown.  I know.  I know.  But I didn't want to correct it.  It's so funny.  He's just like, I'm not Dr. Smith.  Then he's like, I'm not Dr. Smith.  That guy was... 
[00:37:30]  Hey, Rick, great job.  Rick, great booking.  Great booking.  Great booking, Rick.  Thank God we could go with just about anything with this radio program.  First edition of Bad Guest.  Imagine a real radio show that had to have him on.  What would they do?  So tell us more about your prep.  It's a new structure thing.  Today is Autistic Tuesday.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, I wanted to know.  He's so full of energy and so vibrant. 
[00:38:00]  Has he ever considered promotions for WNEW?  No.  Good job, Rick.  That job is shaking.  Hey, guys.  Some of the listeners mocking Rick over his bookings.  Well, it was a good booking.  Yeah, that was.  Bravo.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  WNEW.  WNEW.  We've got to talk about former President Reagan. 
[00:38:30]  Now we can quickly talk to Reagan, I hope.  Well, Reagan's been leaving him on hold for so long.  Reagan's been on hold for about an hour now.  Yeah.  Hour and a half.  I think longer.  About an hour and a half.  Hour and a half.  Mm-hmm.  Everyone knows the story.  Mm-hmm.  Former President Reagan, who's going to be 90. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Poor old codger.  He fell.  He broke his hip.  Everyone knows the story.  But Ann was telling me something I didn't know.  Like the little ball that goes into your hip joint there.  Yeah, when you look at a skeleton, you've got your thigh bone, and it's got that ball on it,  and it fits in the socket in your hip.  It wasn't his actual hip, the pelvis that broke.  It was that ball on top of your thigh that just snapped off.  Little age.  You know what happens?  It's like the ball joint on your car. 
[00:39:30]  You know, your car gets a little old.  Before you know it, it's on the side of the road with the tire all kablooey on the side.  Yeah.  Little cock guy.  It's kind of sad.  A lot of people say when you start breaking your hip, the end is near.  Yeah.  But we're talking about the president, like you said earlier.  I mean, the guy's been shot.  Superhero.  He's had cancer.  He has Alzheimer's.  Now he's breaking a hip.  Doesn't bother him.  Indestructible.  They don't care.  Remember in 1980, when he was running for president, they said,  Ah, Reagan's too old. 
[00:40:00]  Too old to even be president.  And that was 20 years ago?  Yeah.  Oof.  But he lives on.  Well, Anthony, let's go to the phones and see how the former president is doing here.  All right.  Mr. Reagan, Mr. President.  Yeah, let me plug you down the line here.  Hello, Mr. President.  Hello, sir.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hmm.  Maybe something's screwed out front with the phones because Stinky isn't here and he usually runs them.  Yeah.  I'll take a look. 
[00:40:30]  I'll see if it's the right line picked.  No, it's something like that.  Yeah, where are you going?  And I'm going to see if they have the right line picked.  It's the former president.  He's probably just napping.  They're going to wake him up in a sec.  They know we're live in New York.  I think the phone line is okay.  Come back in here.  Ant.  He does this every time the former president calls our radio show.  I don't understand it.  Hello, Mr. Reagan.  Hello, sir.  Hello. 
[00:41:00]  Mr. Reagan, it's Oofy and Anthony.  We got you live in New York on the radio.  You're looking for Mr. Reagan?  Yes.  Please hold.  I'll get him.  No, no, sir.  He was here a minute ago.  Wait, I swear I saw him.  No, no, no, sir.  There he is now.  Wait a minute.  Hey, he's also on the phone and waving back at me.  Yeah, you're looking in the mirror.  Oh, is that what that is?  Yes, Mr. Reagan.  Hello, and God bless the Ukraine.  Why the Ukraine? 
[00:41:30]  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Hello.  Well, I'll...  My fellow Americans.  No, Mr. Gorbachev.  Take down those pants.  No, you don't want to see that.  Well...  Mr. Reagan.  Yes.  Everyone wants to know how you're doing.  You broke your hip over the weekend.  Well, yes.  I seem to have had an accident.  My bones are, well, the consistency of graham crackers.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  I thought...  God damn it.  I thought, you know, you turned to dust after you died, but for some reason, God's playing 
[00:42:00]  this tremendous joke on me.  I'm decomposing while still alive.  Are you doing okay, sir?  Well, yes.  The bone old Ron needs still works, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, I guess we know what you mean, yeah.  You know, the old Ron going out with the bone that works with plenty of bling, bling  and ice.  You got bling, bling and ice?  I'm your Mac Daddy, Ron. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Maybe we'll get some bling, bling and ice for your 90th birthday coming up February 6th.  90?  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, yeah.  Could someone kill me already?  No.  I swear to God.  No.  I want to die.  No, you don't, sir.  If you have ever seen Nancy, believe me, she's been very helpful.  She makes me want to die.  Thank God for Alzheimer's.  Sometimes I forget who I'm married to.  Mr. Reagan, you have told us on this radio show that you're faking the Alzheimer's so you 
[00:43:00]  don't have to deal with your wife.  It's nay on the Alzheimer's, yay.  Okay.  Yes.  I'm fully aware of who I am and who the hell I'm married to.  Yeah.  Is she right by your side there, Mr. Reagan?  Yeah.  Can't talk.  She's right here.  Yeah.  Look at her.  She looks like a silhouette of one of those all-day suckers.  A little stick and a big giant head.  My God.  Oh, no, Nancy. 
[00:43:30]  Who?  What?  I don't know.  I forget about the pain because of the Alzheimer's.  Well, thank God.  Occasionally, it comes back and I realize my hip bone was snapped like Weisman's leg.  Ah.  Oh, it's coming back.  Ah!  Ah!  Sir.  That hurt.  Sir.  Yes.  Are you all right?  Hello.  Are you okay?  Yes.  All right.  I broke my hip.  I realized I was married to Nancy and threw myself down the stairs, hoping it would kill 
[00:44:00]  me, but what the hell am I?  No, that's not a good thing.  Did I come from Krypton and someone didn't tell me, please kill me?  Well, you're going to be released from the hospital soon, sir.  I will survive.  Hey, hey.  I'm celebrating.  Yeah.  I'm a sailboat.  My socks are falling down.  What?  The bombing starts in five minutes.  Hello?  I'm going to run for office again.  Are you?  In four years.  Yeah?  From the coffin. 
[00:44:30]  Please, I hope to Christ I'm dead.  No, no.  A lot of people want to see you make a full recovery.  I once had my finger on the button to the bomb.  Now, I'm licking ice cream cones, drooling, and bones are breaking.  Ah, God.  That sounded like it hurt.  Sir?  Hello?  Mr. Reagan?  Yes, my arm bone just snapped right off.  The weight of the phone was too much.  Ah, well.  I sneezed and my leg went backwards at the knee. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, God.  It's grossing me out.  Look.  Yeah.  When you see Ron, put a chair over my head.  Yeah.  Please kill me.  I can't take...  Have you seen Nancy?  She's right next to you.  She's this skinny little rail in Wim.  Yeah.  Her ass looks like two pieces of cauliflower stuck together.  The cellulite is mind-boggling.  All right.  I can't handle it.  Old Ron's got to get laid.  Well, good luck with that.  My one bone like... 
[00:45:30]  Yes?  Maybe one of those hot nurses that are taking care of you.  Yes, they really want a man that grabs himself.  It's quite a treat for these young nurses to clean my own crap off of my shriveled, wrinkled  old ass.  God, then we...  I was knocking them down three at a time in old Hollywood when I was doing those Bonzo  movies.  Yeah.  Now I'm throwing feces like the monkey.  Sir, we don't need that visual.  Yes, well, it's my life.  Hello?  Sir, we're going to... 
[00:46:00]  I will survive.  Now, sir, we're just going to let you go and get some rest, okay?  Yes.  All right?  Mr. Reagan?  Thank God I'm not there with you and the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Goddamn, I got a break in this room.  Yes, you did.  That's horrific.  All right.  All right, Mr. Reagan.  We'll let you go, okay?  Yes.  All right, sir.  Godspeed.  Godspeed to you, too.  There he goes.  The former president of the United States of America is going to be 90. 
[00:46:30]  And once again, Anthony missed the president.  Anthony.  Oh, my God.  What do you mean you got...  He's gone.  Mr. President Ronald Reagan, one of my favorites.  And he's...  Hello?  He's gone.  Hello?  He's gone.  I talked to him.  I don't know where you were, so...  Goddamn it.  I always go away when Reagan's on.  What happens?  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there. 
[00:47:00]  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Here is why we are doomed.  We are doomed in this battle against terrorism. 
[00:47:30]  I like to think that people are going to wake the F up, Anthony.  It ain't going to happen, as long as there are lawyers and panty wastes out there.  Who did bodyguard lashes out at airline?  There it is.  Remember a while back, the Secret Service agent?  He's an Arab-American.  Secret Service agent, Secret Service agent, was denied boarding and flying on an American Airlines plane because he was armed and he had some inconsistencies with his paperwork to bring a weapon on an aircraft. 
[00:48:00]  And believe me, if two airlines should be a little flustered, it's United and American.  And the pilot said that this guy got a little loud when his identity was questioned as a Secret Service agent.  And they denied him that flight.  And then when everything was checked out, he boarded another American Airlines flight and continued on his way.  Does it end there, Opie?  Does it ever end there? 
[00:48:30]  Of course not.  No.  A lawyer, a scum-sucking lawyer for the Secret Service agent, yesterday accused American Airlines pilot, an American Airlines pilot, of kicking the agent off the flight because he's an Arab-American.  Here's why we're doomed.  But the pilot said he refused to fly the agent because he became loud and abrasive.  The agent, who's a member of Bush's security detail, was booted from the flight.  The only reason why he was not allowed on that plane is because he is an American of Arab descent, said his lawyer, John Relman, probably a self-hating Jew. 
[00:49:00]  Relman sounds like a Jewish name, right?  And he's a lawyer.  How the hell do these Jews take up these scumbags' causes?  How do they do that?  What self-respecting Jewish guy would defend a son of a bitch like this if it wasn't for the money?  You're busting those stereotypes apart, you scumbag lawyers.  Let him have an Arab lawyer. 
[00:49:30]  Why doesn't he?  That doesn't look good in the court.  Looks good if he's got a Jew by his side.  These friggin' Jew lawyers, man, are stupid.  You're stupid.  All Jew lawyers?  Yes.  You're out of your mind.  Dude, what do you want me to say?  I'm being completely honest.  There is no self-respecting Jew that should take the cause of defending these animals.  Animals.  That's what I'm saying.  He's a self-hating Jew. 
[00:50:00]  If there's a Jew out there that wouldn't take this case, God bless you.  Pure and simple, this is a case of discrimination.  That's what he's saying.  The agent identified in published reports as Waleed Shatair is demanding, here it is, an apology for the airlines and civil rights training for its flight crews.  You know something? 
[00:50:30]  You know, the only civil rights trainings I think pilots need is fly over where two buildings used to be.  If an American Airlines pilot has a doubt in his mind about an Arab getting on your plane, yes, an Arab.  Those are the only people so far that have crashed into our buildings.  If an Irishman hijacks a plane, then those effing Irish bastards shouldn't be allowed on either.  Hey, hey, hey.  What?  Be careful.  I'm just saying that.  We're too busy getting drunk.  We don't have time for something like that. 
[00:51:00]  I understand.  All right, the Italians.  If an Italian gets on a plane and crashes it into our buildings, any Dago that wants to board a plane should be denied.  Now, what I'm saying is, this guy was an Arab.  Yes, an Arab-American.  Freaking forget about it.  Hey, forget about it.  Forget about it.  This isn't about civil rights training.  This is about self-preservation.  It's about changing things in time of war and not having to apologize for your actions. 
[00:51:30]  Maybe next time the pilot will have suspicions and think to himself, you know something?  I really need this effing job.  And if this son of a bitch turns around and takes me to court on some civil rights violation, I might get fired.  So you know what?  I'm going to let him on.  I'm going to question my better judgment and let this guy on this plane.  And then we're right back to square one again.  We can't worry about offending people.  And this Secret Service agent is a scumbag, too.  He should take the bullet and just go, all right, you know something? 
[00:52:00]  We're in wacky times here.  Sucks to be me.  Sucks to be me right now.  Sucks to be me this time around.  It sure sucked to be the Japs in the 40s when they were putting them in happy little camps out in the desert.  But you know something?  Times change.  We got over it.  We buy you cars.  That's right.  The sushi's good.  The sushi's great.  I love the nail places for the girls and the Yankee Cranky happy ending.  You can't beat it.  Those are the Koreans, Anthony.  Them, too.  Then here's another thing from the We Are Doomed portion of this war. 
[00:52:30]  That Moussaoui guy, the accomplice that was supposed to be one of the hijackers.  The 20th hijacker.  The bull guy.  Arrested.  He's going to stand trial now for conspiracy.  Faces the death penalty on some of these charges.  Thank God.  And him and his lawyer now asking for a televised trial on court TV to assure he gets a fair trial. 
[00:53:00]  He wants the American people, same people he was killing, to now assure him of a fair trial.  And what's his lawyer's name?  I can't find it right here.  You know what this guy's doing?  But just like they used our resources, our American ingenuity and know-how to kill Americans,  they're now going to use the same stuff to try to get off the hook. 
[00:53:30]  The American press, TV, and our stupid liberal panty-waist emotions.  You know, I would love to watch it on court TV.  I always loved that thing.  The O.J. thing was a scream.  It was a hoot.  I liked the trial with the blue dot.  The blue dot trial with the Kennedy rape thing?  Yeah, right.  That was good.  That was a fun one.  But you know something?  No.  I think this should be behind closed doors.  Put them in.  Go in the indoor.  Come out the outdoor in a body bag.  I don't care what happens in the interim. 
[00:54:00]  All these guys.  All of them.  You mark my words.  That son of a bitch traitor.  That John Walker guy.  When they bring him back.  Same thing.  They're going to use every resource to save their asses.  And you know what?  We'll buckle under.  Those effing lawyers will twist it around.  And they'll make him the poor victimized son of a bitch.  And he'll never see the death penalty.  Thank you.  So I say to you, Americans, never forget what we saw September 11th. 
[00:54:30]  Keep that in mind when these people are being tried.  If it takes years, always remember what happened.  And never, ever get soft on these people.  We can't let political correctness get in the way of justice and our safety in this country.  If an Arab gets upset because he's denied access to an airplane because of discrepancies, 
[00:55:00]  oh, so be it.  It's the way it's got to be.  That's the time we're living in now.  We have to be inconvenienced as Americans and fear for our lives.  You must be inconvenienced then with some more extra scrutiny.  Let's leave streets.  And in closing.  And the rockets were good.  God bless America.  Thank you.  You know, the last person anyone should ask about the whereabouts of any of the senior Al-Qaeda or Taliban is Don Rumsfeld. 
[00:55:30]  To the extent I had any knowledge, it would be self-defeating for our country and for our effort for me to even utter any thought about that  because it would be a clear indication that those individuals should stop being where they're being.  So it would be mindless for me to answer a question right now.  And I shall not answer a question right now. 
[00:56:00]  But do you think those reports are credible?  I'm coming to that.  I'm coming to that.  So I have not in the past and I will not in the future answer those questions about their location.  Anyone who does answer those questions.  Who probably either does not know what they're talking about or if they do, are violating federal criminal law 
[00:56:30]  by providing intelligence information that it's against the law to provide to people who are not cleared for that intelligence information.  So I really, we're looking for them.  We intend to find them and we intend to capture or kill them.  And that's the best we can do.  Hey, that's nice.  I figured a Rumsfeld clip would be nice there.  I love that Rumsfeld guy. 
[00:57:00]  Some people are a little angry.  Some people agreeing with me, so I'm a little angry.  Well, sure.  John, what's up?  Hey, Anthony.  Hello.  John, first of all, is not a Jewish name.  It's from the Bible.  Okay?  I'm not talking about the John part.  I'm just saying, you know, whatever.  I've seen plenty.  I was watching CNN the other night and there is a fine Jewish gentleman lawyer talking about how he would take up the cause of any of these terrorists. 
[00:57:30]  And I could not figure out why on earth they would do that.  These people hate the Jews and want them dead.  Yet you would defend them.  The Jewish people would then defend them.  I just can't understand it.  Dude, second, that guy is Egyptian.  He's not an Arab.  What the hell is Egyptian?  That's Arab.  He's not Arab.  Oh, Egyptian is an Arab gentleman.  So, dude, when you went to Opera Aida, you and your girlfriend, you want to tell me you went to an Arab opera? 
[00:58:00]  I heard girlfriend and that's all I understood.  What happened?  I said when you went, you and your girlfriend to Opera Aida in Manhattan.  You went, you and your girlfriend to Arab opera or you went to an Egyptian?  Opera.  What?  I went to an Arab opera or Egyptian opera.  Oh, Aida?  Yes.  Oh, I think I understood this guy.  Jesus.  I thought either we were being hijacked or he was talking about Aida.  Yes, sir.  I went to see Aida. 
[00:58:30]  Aida.  I don't know about Egyptian or Arab.  It is Egyptian.  I know.  They all wear those things on their head.  Well, it's a big difference between Egyptian and Arab.  Look at the map.  What is Egypt and Africa?  Look, right now, I don't care what nationality they are.  If you're going on the plane with a gun and you're Arab, Egyptian or any other part of that place over there, you have some extra scrutiny you got to go through.  That's just the way it is.  Sorry.  That guy is secret service for God's sake.  What are you expecting? 
[00:59:00]  He had a gun and he was going on a plane.  I think George Bush should be there to say he's dead.  And even then it should be questioned.  You know what I'm talking about?  It's the time we live in.  Face it.  God.  We do face it.  We live in this country.  We know exactly what you're talking about.  But if the guy is secret service, have a badge, have an ID, a couple of men ticket.  Hey, I can't be blamed for the fact that your ancestors decided to do something horrible. 
[00:59:30]  The people that are related to your ancestors in some way did something awful.  You know?  So now you're the guys that got to take the brunt of it.  Sorry.  There have been plenty of other races during the history that have had to do the same thing.  We're not talking about violence.  We're talking about just suspicion.  That's it.  Right.  We're a little more suspicious right now.  Okay.  Thank you, John.  West Coast Dave saying he never wants to hear that guy's voice on an airplane.  Ever. 
[01:00:00]  What happened?  She's being held hostage?  Erica really upset at Boston.  What's the matter, Erica?  Hi.  Hi.  Okay.  I'm a 20-year-old from Boston.  And I was listening to you guys a few minutes ago and heard what you were saying about Jews.  Not too liberal.  20-year-old from Boston.  Ho-ho.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  So, I was just wondering if you consider yourselves to be patriotic.  Yes, I do.  Sure.  Okay. 
[01:00:30]  So, do you think it's productive to say negative things about a population in the United States,  which is part of this country?  You know what I'm saying negative?  Am I saying negative things about all Jews?  The way you were saying it seemed like you pretty much were being pretty anti-Semitic.  I see.  Anti-Semitic.  There you go.  Because I'm pointing out that there are unscrupulous Jewish lawyers out there that take up the causes of arrogance.  But you know what?  There are unscrupulous Christian lawyers, too.  Yeah, but you know something?  So, why did you differentiate between whether or not they're Jewish?  Erica, because Jews have a special interest in this that Christian lawyers don't. 
[01:01:00]  They should absolutely not take up the causes of these people that have been trying to eliminate them,  that hate them, that want them dead for years.  Why, then, would you, as a Jewish lawyer, take up these people's causes?  Right.  And so, you can say that maybe you don't think it makes sense,  but does that mean that you should go around saying that they're only doing it for the money and all these other things?  Well, then why, they're doing it for money and notoriety, period.  Well, I think a lot of lawyers do that, but I don't think there's a reason to, uh... 
[01:01:30]  No, there is a reason, because there's a special circumstance with Jewish lawyers,  as opposed to any other lawyer in this circumstance.  Any self-respecting Jewish lawyer should not take up the cause of these terrorists.  I don't think any lawyer should, all right?  I'll say that, but even more so, the Jewish lawyer should stay away from this.  Well, I understand what you're saying, but I think that the way you talked about it really is pretty silly,  pretty silly considering that what just happened on September 11th showed us how much hate there is in the world 
[01:02:00]  and how much we don't need to contribute to that because there's enough.  Erica, you know why I'm saying it like that?  Because I'm not thinking about sounding politically correct.  It's not about sounding politically correct.  Yes, it is.  It's about not sending...  It's about not perpetuating Nazism.  I mean, what you were saying sounds like something that you would have heard on the radio 40 years ago.  See what happens the second you criticize a Jewish lawyer for taking up the cause of an Arab. 
[01:02:30]  You're automatically now an anti-Semite and akin to Hitler.  Holy Jesus Palomino, Erica.  Well, I'm sorry, but I think if some...  What's your religion?  Me? I'm pretty much nothing.  Okay, well, if there was something about yourself, whether you're...  Whatever your ethnic background is, and people were going around saying,  those damn Polish lawyers, they blah, blah, blah.  If I...  You know something?  They're greedy, whatever.  I think you might be a little upset, too, and it's not about being politically correct.  If I hadn't opened a mind enough to realize that whatever ethnic background I had was being hypocritical, 
[01:03:00]  I would shut my mouth, is what I'd do.  I'm not responsible for what Jewish lawyers choose to do.  That's their personal decision.  Well, then why are you then defending...  But for you to talk about all Jewish lawyers in a derogatory way,  because of what a few people are doing, is not right.  Hey, Erica, I said I would shake the hand of a Jewish lawyer  that would absolutely turn these sons of bitches down.  I would shake his hand, pat him on the back, and go,  God damn, I can't believe it.  Fantastic.  But you know something? 
[01:03:30]  I'm only seeing the ones on TV that are taking up the causes.  I'm sure there are plenty...  Right, which is a very, very small percentage, isn't it?  Right!  That's what I'm saying.  Okay, well, I hope you take that into account next time.  I am!  Before you open your mouth to say something.  I'm calling the ones that are accepting the cases, dirtbags.  Thank you, Erica.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, well, there's another ten minutes of radio that Chicago won't hear tonight.  I didn't even get to call her a twat, and you hung up.  Holy jeez.  He's like, how do you get to call her a twat, and you hung up?  Yes, Maggie, that's what I said. 
[01:04:00]  Well, hey, Maggie, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  All right.  Like Maggie could repeat it.  Read that back to me, please.  No, I was telling the girls in my office, because we're on a delay.  So I'm hearing everything, and then I'm telling them.  Okay.  Hi.  I live in New Hampshire.  I live in Portsmouth, and the town next door...  Which town?  Dover.  Dover, sure.  Yeah, in their high school, there were two girls elected best couple.  And there was a big problem with it, and finally, the principal allowed it to happen.  Well, this group of Baptists came from Kansas. 
[01:04:30]  The goddamn Baptists.  Mother effing.  I don't know about the Baptists.  And they are protesting.  I need Baptist lawyers.  I have no clue about the Baptists.  I don't either.  Are there any Baptist lawyers?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Anyway, yeah, I have my...  So what was the prom?  Two girls were, what, voted prom king and queen or something?  No, no, no.  They were voted best couple.  Best couple.  They were together.  Oh, for the cute yearbook picture?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:05:00]  And so this group from Kansas comes down, and they're standing outside the Dover High School  and all over Dover with these signs like, God hates Dover.  They came all the way from Kansas to protest that...  Yeah, fags must die.  Like, all these horrible, like, Matt Shepard must rot in hell for three years.  I...  These horrible people.  I guess they get funded by some church group.  Yeah.  I enjoy the lesbian couples in the... 
[01:05:30]  Well, I mean, I don't...  Like, I'm not a lesbian, but I mean...  Yeah.  More hate in the name of religion.  Huh?  More hate in the name of religion.  It's wonderful, isn't it?  I know.  We are doomed as a human race.  Yeah.  I don't know about that.  We are.  I completely believe we're doomed.  People worry about...  You remember yesterday, the guy called up and goes, someday, the sun is going to get  so big, it's going to engulf the earth and then shrink down to a white dwarf.  And we are all going to die.  We are so going to be gone by then, by our own devices and stupidity, that it's ridiculous 
[01:06:00]  to even have the audacity to believe that we would be around then.  Dude, you're freaking out, God, because now lights are going off in here.  God agrees with me.  Shut up.  Well, why are the lights going off?  Not all of them, either.  One, two, three, four went out.  I'm right above you.  Erica.  Holy crap.  Stupid Erica.  Stupid Erica.  Ugh.  I enjoy the lesbian couples in the high schools.  Well, there shouldn't be a problem with it.  I saw a little high school lesbian couple walking hand-in-hand at the Roosevelt Mall when I was 
[01:06:30]  in the Christmas shop.  That's cute.  Loved it.  Followed them for ten minutes.  Did they have the little lesbian haircut going?  Did one of them have the short on top, long on the back?  They were the lipstick.  Lipstick lesbos variety, Anthony.  I like that.  I enjoyed it.  It was very nice.  And, man, you should see the looks on people that don't get it.  They were horrified.  I followed.  All right, Maggie, thank you.  You're welcome.  Okay.  You guys are awesome.  Well, we...  Awesome or awful?  What did she say?  I don't know.  Something or...  All right.  Let's take a break. 
[01:07:00]  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  In commercials, you're talking about this article.  I want to touch on about children born this year have the potential of living to 130 years old.  With the medical technology that's out there now. 
[01:07:30]  Get that.  If you're born now, year 2000, a couple years in the future, whatever, the potential is you could live to be 130 years old.  Imagine the goddamn drivers then.  Oh, my God.  Well, screw that.  All right, so a baby's born around now, or whatever, give or take a few years.  Right now, you have the potential of reaching not the average age.  What about guys like you and I in our 30s?  Well, we're doomed to do it. 
[01:08:00]  Is it still...  We're doomed.  We only have to, what, like 80 or so?  No, let me...  Are we pushing 100?  Let me look at the chart.  You're born in the 60s.  Mm-hmm.  You have the potential of making it 105 years old.  105.  That's not the average age, mind you, of death.  That's how...  That's pretty much how old you can get.  That's like stretching the...  That's pushing it, the life boundaries.  Yeah.  But now they're saying that children born today could live to be 130. 
[01:08:30]  130.  Now, after like 80, I guess, maybe 80 years old, if you really keep yourself in shape, you're 80.  It's pretty much over.  I'm sorry, but what are you going to do past 80?  Your sex?  Wait, what's that?  And who are you having sex with?  80-year-old women?  70-year-old women?  Well, maybe if you're 80, they look good.  Unless you got that Anna Nicole Smith thing, but you need... 
[01:09:00]  Right.  ...quab drew billions of dollars.  Right.  But for the most part, you have now 50 more years, if you're 80 years old, you have 50  more years to contemplate how you're not getting sex from attractive women.  I don't know.  How you're rotting away.  Maybe you go in those old age homes and you're getting it, man.  Yeah, but look at what you're...  Yeah, but you got the cataracts, your brain's not completely there.  Maybe it's like good...  It's nice, sloppy sex.  All right, it's time for Opie to view Century Sex again. 
[01:09:30]  It's time for Opie to look at Century Sex, the video of the 100-year-old lady getting  banged.  Because do you want to have sex with E.T.?  No, no.  Remember, she looked like E.T.  No, no.  Her body, gravity had pulled everything from her upper body down to her hips and stomach  so she had these saggy boobs on this skeletal shoulder frame and then the hips and thighs  were big and fat.  E.T. 
[01:10:00]  The hips still went out.  Yeah, E.T.  So now you have 50 years.  So what happens?  You reach 120 and you're like, 10 more to go.  10 to go.  10 to go.  I'm on the big death countdown.  Maybe when you get to that age, though, you just don't know.  No.  You don't know what you're missing.  That's what I'm...  I swear to God, that's what I'm hoping.  You know something?  You better hope that because I don't think that's the truth of the matter.  Because I think, you know, I'm hoping when I hit like 60, then I don't know what I'm  missing. 
[01:10:30]  If I have to walk around like that, I'm in my 60s or 70s and I'm seeing these hot pieces  of asses all over Manhattan and I can't have a taste, I will jump off a bridge.  I'm just hoping my brain goes and maybe my libido goes.  Pick a bridge.  That's going to be the worst nightmare.  Dude, you want to taste the reality?  All those things that you think about now, you're going to think about when you get old.  There are people in there, the old people, 80 years old, that are like afraid to fly. 
[01:11:00]  I know these people that are afraid to fly because they're afraid the plane might crash.  Take the chance.  You're going to miss out on Aruba and the Bahamas.  I swear I know people.  Old people that are afraid to fly.  Get your ass on the plane.  What do you go, geez, you're missing out on three, four more years and you're passing  up the chance to go and see things you've never seen before?  Holy mother of Christ.  Can you believe that? 
[01:11:30]  80 years old, I'm afraid to fly.  Get your wrinkled ass in that seat.  If it goes down, Jesus, who cares?  Man.  Look at the poor bastard in his 20s sitting next to you.  Feel bad for him.  But PB, which just proves my point that you're still thinking like, I don't want to die.  I want to get laid.  I want to do this.  I want.  So, so this is going to be a day.  We're going to be like, we're going to be walking around Manhattan.  Uh-huh.  Our pants pulled up to our nipples. 
[01:12:00]  We're going to have the Terminator sunglasses on.  The white, like, polyester pants, like the golf pants that the old guys wear.  Are we going to have, like, the walkers with the brakes?  The walkers with the wheels and the handbrakes, which I still completely don't understand.  With the tennis balls on the end of it.  On the end of it, so they don't scrape up the little rubber pads.  Right.  You know, see, like, the handbrakes.  So we're going to be walking around Manhattan.  Watch it.  I'm coming through.  So we're going to be walking around Manhattan.  Some hot piece of ass is going to walk by us. 
[01:12:30]  And you're going to look.  Mambo boobs, tight-fitting outfit, those fine leather pants that all the women are wearing nowadays.  Yes.  Huge cleavage.  And you're going to be thinking, oh, my God, I wish I could have that?  Yes.  Of course, Opie.  They will all be wearing sort of a tinfoil-ish space suit that far in the future.  And we'll all be in space cars.  Yeah, of course we will.  Just like we were promised when we were kids.  So I don't know how the ass and boobs are going to look in that Mylar suit with the little space agency emblem over the boob. 
[01:13:00]  But regardless, yeah, you will look and say, oh, I don't have a piece of that.  How much longer?  Oh, 50 more years.  This is great.  God, that's going to suck.  You know, the best you could hope for is like that Jack LaLanne MRF-er who, like, took care of himself and exercised.  He was 80 years old, and he's pulling a train with his teeth and stuff.  But, yeah, that's the only train he's pulling because you see he's still married, and he's got his wife, and he's like, oh, I took care of myself. 
[01:13:30]  You didn't make the commitment, huh, honey?  Now he's got to deal with that.  Danielle is getting depressed by us today.  We're supposed to make people happy on a Friday.  Danielle, what's going on?  You guys are depressing me.  Why?  What's the problem?  God, I'm 29.  I'm having a midlife crisis, and you're making it worse.  Well, why don't we just have the first annual O&A orgy?  Yeah, so we can all look back when we're old and say, hey, well, at least we got that.  Why don't we have just one massive banging? 
[01:14:00]  You know, Anthony, I am afraid to fly, but you just made it where, I don't know, now I have to.  Take the chance.  I will.  Take the gamble.  And the older you get, god damn, fly a crop duster that's doing barrel rolls at that age, because who cares?  What the hell are you waiting for?  Danielle, let's bang tonight.  You want to?  Have some of that unprotected sex, like we were talking about.  What the hell?  But 130 years old. 
[01:14:30]  Could you imagine living to be 130?  You know, I have a great ass now.  I should send you a picture of it now.  So, when I get older, you can remember that I had a nice ass now.  Oh.  All right, cool.  Well, yes, we love when you girls send in the body parts.  Sure, we don't mind.  We don't mind.  We'll hang it up in the office.  Yes.  I'll do that.  Thank you.  Do you know anybody, honestly, over 80 years old, that is enjoying the lifestyle that they enjoyed when they were in their 30s and, let's even say, 40s? 
[01:15:00]  No.  No.  But at that point, I don't know.  You know, you see the people, you go over the house, and you're like, ooh, Grandpa's doing so well.  This is so great.  You know, it's wonderful.  Well, look at Grandma.  She's 85 years old, and I'll tell you, she's sharp as a tack, and she goes, you know something?  She walks to the corner herself with the cart and does her own shopping.  Ooh!  Wow!  Goddamn, she's storming a castle. 
[01:15:30]  What happened to the days where she was having sex on her hands?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Doing back handsprings and landing on penis.  You know, it's all relative, but then, the point I'm getting is 130 years.  What the hell kind of lifestyle?  Now you're just extending the crappy part of the life.  But we don't know that.  Science is like an amazing thing, Anthony.  We are doing things today that we couldn't do, what, 20 years ago?  Not that amazing.  It's the equivalent of just bleeding with leeches.  We haven't come that far. 
[01:16:00]  Where's the goddamn little thing Bones used to go, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo,  over the body and do that?  Where's that?  And how come in the episode where they all got old, Spock got old right along with them,  and Vulcans lived to be like 200?  Sorry.  I don't know if I'm a tangent.  Maybe when our body parts get old, we'll just get new ones.  What, like they'll sew them on or grow them like a lizard's tail?  I don't know.  What about the guy we talked about on the show where he got a brand new arm?  Sideshow freak. 
[01:16:30]  That isn't science.  He got a new arm from a dead guy.  Great.  Wonderful.  To replace his old non-working limb.  No, no.  We need to make the next step where you go into a chamber and get beamed with something,  and you come out and you're like, howdy-do, where are the chicks?  Something.  Not this piecemeal patchwork stuff that happens.  We were promised all this in the year 2000, and we got jack.  And you know how you were saying that older people should take that chance and fly? 
[01:17:00]  Because what the hell?  Get on the plane.  I don't think you made Tom too happy about that.  What's the matter?  Tom, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  It's a long story, but check it out.  Anthony, you're going to freak out.  What?  My grandparents, they were nearly four or five years ago.  My grandparents from their late 70s, they never traveled anywhere.  They didn't want to go nowhere, afraid to fly, forbid to go on a plane.  So they hadn't been anywhere their whole lives?  Their whole lives.  Maybe Pennsylvania, Jersey, stuff like that.  Never flew.  50th wedding anniversary. 
[01:17:30]  We finally talked them into a nice trip to Aruba.  How old were they?  Oh, my God.  My grandfather was almost 80.  My grandmother was about 77 or something like that.  Yeah.  So they weren't too old, but they were old enough.  Finally get them on the plane.  After weeks of coaxing them, get on the plane.  Mid-flight, halfway to Aruba, they hit about 20 minutes of turbulence.  My grandfather has a heart attack and dies on the plane.  That's great.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you.  No. 
[01:18:00]  Wait a minute.  Are you kidding?  Listen.  The story gets better.  As long as it gets better, it gets worse.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  All right.  Keep laughing.  Go ahead.  Oh, no.  Go ahead.  I'm saying that's horrible.  Tom, it's an uncomfortable laugh.  I know.  It really isn't that funny.  Check it out.  It isn't funny.  My grandmother is so distraught.  Now, they don't turn the plane around, you know?  So they land in Aruba.  They call my parents up.  My uncle and my father, they get on the next plane.  They go down there because my grandmother now, she won't get on a plane. 
[01:18:30]  She's a wretch.  That's a long drive from Aruba.  Yeah, right?  They'll call her.  What's that?  The Alpha Car Service.  The Alpha Car Service.  Whatever.  They'll come and get you on time.  Well, check this out.  So my father and uncle go down there.  They stay down there a week and a half because they just cannot get my grandmother on a flight.  It's impossible.  They just can't do it.  Oh.  Finally get her on.  You know, they sedated.  They gave her some sort of medication to calm her down.  They get her on a plane.  They go back home to New York.  By the month later, my grandmother is so distraught over this, she ends up dying. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, my God.  So, you know, you say take the chance in life and you get to a point where you don't care anymore.  Meanwhile, 50th anniversary.  The whole family is like cursed now because of it.  Uh, well, you know something?  Hey, they were, what an adventure.  Yeah, some adventure, Ed.  And they were, well, you know, so how many, honestly, how many more good years did he have?  Yeah, but you know what?  I look at it like, why couldn't this happen on the way back?  At least we had a nice vacation under the belt. 
[01:19:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I hear you.  But what the hell are they going to do in a room?  Bang in the hotel room?  Go surfboarding?  You know, go sailboarding?  What, are they going to get a Kawasaki jet ski and tear it up in the bay?  No, they're going to sit on the beach and complain about the sun's too hot, the goddamn bones hurt, the food sucks.  They love the heat because he'd be in mid-August and he'd be walking around with these wool sweaters on.  So, they love the heat.  Ed, you just described my last vacation.  Yeah, wait a minute, that was Opie.  Oh, the weather sucks. 
[01:20:00]  The food's horrible.  The weird thing is that the whole family chips in, you know, everybody's got to pull in their money, make the plans, reservations, all this, that.  And they all croak a die on it.  Well, see, that might happen, but they should still get their ass on the plane.  I understand.  See, the odds are that everything will be fine.  But sometimes things, yes, do happen.  And the thing about it was, the airlines wouldn't even give us a refund. 
[01:20:30]  They won't even, like, give us the money back or anything.  For the other trip back?  Yeah.  If I count right, there's a one-way ticket from Aruba back that isn't being used.  I mean, they gave us a percentage of the flight fee, but, I mean, it was nowhere near what we chilled out for.  I mean, it was ridiculous, man, you know?  It was horrible.  At least he got to enjoy the really bad turbulence.  Yeah, well, thanks, Tom.  Thanks, boys.  No problem.  Love my stupid radio.  I still thank you.  Tom, you did good.  I still stand by what I said. 
[01:21:00]  Old people should not be afraid to fly, to do anything.  Get out there.  Just going to find you sitting in your goddamn recliner anyway.  When the phone calls aren't being answered and Junior goes over the house, that's all they're going to do.  You might as well go out in a blaze of glory on some turbulence on the way to Aruba.  See, even though he didn't make it, that's still kind of cool.  It's better than the old lady trying to wake him up in bed the next morning and all of a sudden, he's cold. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Well, come on.  He's cold.  You're on your mind today.  Why are you in such a f***ed up mood?  Ah, wait a minute.  Well, you can't say that.  You're on your mind, though.  Jesus.  Anthony, lots of instant feedback coming in today.  Bill from Cliffside.  How nasty is a 130-year-old woman going to be?  She's going to look like a deflated football.  My God.  Because at 70 and 80, the body is just being pulled down. 
[01:22:00]  Now, the most you could do is hope to be, like, in your 60s and end up like some of these women that you see.  Can you name one in their 60s that people still consider to be hot?  I bet you.  Raquel Welch, how old is she?  I was going to say, Raquel Welch has got to be pulled down.  The other one, Angie Dickinson there, Jay Moore was just talking about her.  You know, that's the best you could hope for.  So let's even push it and say 70 years old.  Things are really...  And for the most part, 99% of the population by 70, it's over, Johnny. 
[01:22:30]  What about Hugh Hefner, Anthony?  He's living like he's in his 30s.  Again, it all comes down to the cash, and he's putting these naked women in his magazine.  So he's got, like, a bevy of the girls that are coming up to him that want to be in the magazine.  Do you think he realizes that?  But he probably doesn't even care.  If he was Hugh Hefner, the accountant, do you think these supermodel twin bimbos would be hobbing his knob?  No.  Hell no.  He would be married to, like, Joan Rivers.  Right.  Right.  But, you know something, that isn't even the point.  Right.  And then you get, like, imagine a 130-year-old woman. 
[01:23:00]  What gravity would do to 130 years, during 130 years.  It would be like spending a normal lifespan on Jupiter, where the gravity is just, like, pulling the skin to your ankles.  Boobs could hit the floor, literally, by 130 years.  All right.  Pete from Long Island.  It's like when my grandfather comes to my house.  I know the first person he goes to say hello to is my girlfriend. 
[01:23:30]  The hug and kiss on the cheek he gives her is probably the closest he's had to sex in 30 years.  Oh, how sad is that?  A hug.  God damn, does that suck.  A hug on a young girl.  Oh, my God.  It goes right over to a girl.  Come here, honey.  And old men and old women, the difference is, I mean, the branch goes out so far apart as you get older.  Like, the old men are still thinking about the sex. 
[01:24:00]  The women, it's been over for so long that that's it.  So you don't think the old women think about sex?  No.  In general?  In general, no.  There's a few, you know, ringers out there, I'm sure.  But for the most part, the men are still, like, they really want to have sex.  I'm sure a lot of them are non-functional.  But think of being a functional man in your 80s.  You're still thinking about sex.  And it's hard enough to find women now.  Right.  Imagine when the population has been cut by 90%, and then 90% of those don't want to have sex anymore. 
[01:24:30]  It's so over.  Pete.  He knows.  He likes the girls in here.  Our own engineer, Pete.  Of course he does.  Pete.  What did he say?  I don't do local shows.  Oh, he only goes on the shows that are nationally syndicated.  Pete, the engineer at WNW, he's been here for what, for 35 years or something like that? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  And Ben tried to get him in the studio to talk about having sex at an older age.  We don't know how old Pete is.  Well, if he doesn't want to come in, we'll just talk about him without him in here, which  will be ten times worse.  And Pete said he doesn't do local shows because he's on the Don and Mike show a lot.  Yeah.  A show that is syndicated across the country.  He likes doing syndicated shows, Anthony.  And he once strapped a dildo onto his chin and had a stripper sit on it, Hopey, on the  Don and Mike show.  And, see, he enjoyed it. 
[01:25:30]  And he's got to be pushing, what, 75?  Yeah.  He doesn't want to come in.  Oh, he'll come in.  All right.  Let's go to Linda.  Yes.  Hi, Linda.  What's up?  Oh, I have an embarrassing story with my grandparents.  It's about ten o'clock at night.  They were in the early 80s.  We all get this phone call that the ambulance went to the house.  They picked up my grandfather.  They took him to the hospital.  It turned out a couple of days later, we found out that they started getting a little frisky  with each other.  And they started getting chest pains in the middle of the act. 
[01:26:00]  And it just, I mean, now my grandmother's a little old, tiny lady in house dresses.  You know, you don't even say boo in her house.  And just the vision of the two of them.  Going at it.  Oh, forget it.  And I'm sure it's just like, it's probably just on the verge of rape because the woman  really doesn't want to do it.  No, it's not my grandmother.  It's like one step below rape.  I mean, just the garb of itself coming out.  Come on.  Give it to me.  I haven't had it in 30 years, you bitch.  Spread them. 
[01:26:30]  It was nasty, though.  I mean, it was just insane.  Oh, my God.  The vision now.  All right, Linda.  It's nuts.  Thank you.  Okay.  You suck.  You don't want to think about that.  I want to talk to some of these grandparents about.  Bang and Anthony.  That's what I want to get in.  Yeah, where's an old person?  Fred, what's going on?  My grandmother.  She's 84.  Yeah.  She, every time we talk to her, every time we go over, she says how good my grandfather  died, how good my grandfather was, and how she popped her cherry, and how he knew just 
[01:27:00]  when to pull out, because she didn't want any more kids.  So we came, my wife and I came home from our honeymoon, and she took her aside, and she  was asking, you know, how was it?  Was it good?  Did you like it your first time?  I mean, I'm like, that is disgusting.  Pretty cool, huh?  That gives you the heebie-jeebies.  You don't like your grandma talking to you about sex.  My wife won't go talk to her by herself now.  Somebody's got to go with her when she talks to her.  Grandma should just talk about, you know, she went to the store, boo, the tomatoes are 
[01:27:30]  good.  That's it.  You don't want to hear anything about grandma sex.  That's what grandpa said, too.  Crazy.  The tomatoes are good.  The tomatoes were good.  The tomatoes were good.  All right, Fred.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  Her peach turned into an apple that stayed in the sun.  Oh, an old apple.  What are all the implants going to look like at 130 years old?  All the cosmetic surgery.  I mean, you've seen Joan Rivers. 
[01:28:00]  She's had all those facelifts and stuff, and now she's got, like, GoFunny eyes.  Looks like you just stretched a latex glove over the Crypt Keeper.  I think the breast implants.  Yeah.  Like, let's say a real hot girl with big, huge double Ds.  Yeah.  At about 40 to 50 years, let's say.  Yeah.  Just what it's going to look like.  You take a bowling ball.  Right.  And you put it in a white sock.  A sweat sock.  A sweat sock. 
[01:28:30]  That's what they're going to look like.  There you go.  Normal boots.  Oh, yeah.  It'll still be very firm at the bottom.  Very firm.  Probably hard.  They probably harden.  Solidify.  But it'll be sagging pretty damn low.  You see how regular boobs get on old women from when we watched that Century Sex.  They're like little thin tubes where they connect to the chest.  And then they expand outward as they approach the nip.  And then add implants.  Ooh.  All right, Anthony.  You're going to be able to spin them around.  We've got to take a quick break. 
[01:29:00]  We'll be back in just a bit.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  All right.  Best Ass Contest.  Continuing.  Our latest contestant is outside the studio.  Girls.  We have a trip to Vegas up for grabs.  Bring in our next contestant. 
[01:29:30]  This is our third contestant.  This is a little strange because usually when we're ready to bring in a contestant, everyone's all happy.  It's all psyched.  And jovial.  Yeah, you know, I thought this was like a really good thing.  You know, bring her in and freak you guys out.  And then I just remembered I've got to take the pictures.  All right.  Bring her in.  Who saw this coming?  Oh, my God.  Ah, here we go.  You're a punishment for abuse.  It's Patty.  Hello.  Hello, Patty.  Hello.  Patty, you don't have much teeth left, man. 
[01:30:00]  What's going on?  You're grinding them down at night?  What are you talking about?  I hope she's got the chiclets.  I know.  What's happening over there?  You grind your teeth at night?  Sometimes.  And I'm thinking about the edge.  And your friend Reynolds is in the studio.  Yes.  The one that can't stand you but won't say it to your face.  What?  What happened?  Are you writing her lines for her today?  Yes.  You're a writer, right?  Yes, I'm her writer today.  Yeah, he writes for 10-10 wins. 
[01:30:30]  10-10 wins.  Give us 22 minutes.  We'll give you a headache.  Wow, right?  That's great.  A little job burn out there, huh?  That must be something.  Oh, geez.  The same old crap news every day.  That's funny, Ronald.  We're still all proud of their Avianca picture up in the lobby of wins.  Remember that one from 10 years ago, whatever it was?  Yeah, yeah.  Look, we were there first.  We won an award.  Yeah, great.  Reynolds?  Do you have anything to say to Patty? 
[01:31:00]  Good luck.  Good luck?  Good luck.  Patty.  Tell Patty how you really feel, Reynolds.  I can't say it on the radio.  Tell her what you tell us when we're on the subway.  Oh, no.  She's such a nice girl.  You've been friends for how long, Patty?  What, 25 years?  25 years.  She's been hounding you.  That's what I have to look forward to?  It never ends.  It never ends.  It's 25 years.  She'll be following us around. 
[01:31:30]  Great.  You were working at wins 25 years ago?  22.  22 years ago?  So this started where?  Where did it say that again?  The relationship with Patty.  Oh, it started in high school.  High school.  Ah, there you go.  We were in plays and shows together and stuff.  Yeah, you did plays?  She had solos.  Yeah, she had solos.  Solo, you couldn't hear her.  Oh.  That's really good.  Now, Patty, you were in plays? 
[01:32:00]  Yes, I was.  And what did you do?  Give me a play that you did.  It was in Oliver.  I forgot what I played.  The maid or something with the glass of water that had to throw all over somebody.  Something.  That's what you do.  Look at Reynolds, just like, oh, brother.  Reynolds, come on.  So you're in a play.  We can help you end this relationship.  It's been 25 years.  Oh, stop.  How could we help him, Opie, when you can't even help yourself?  Oh, stop.  Yeah, but it's only been like two years.  Yeah, but you've tried.  Look at the guy. 
[01:32:30]  25 years of this.  It's been 25 years.  Yeah, you can say that.  Easy.  Please, sir, could I have some more?  I need more.  I'm starving.  Patty, why are you entering the Best Ass Contest?  Because I think I qualify.  All right.  Patty, let's be showing some more confidence these days.  And my Bobo is as good as anyone else's. 
[01:33:00]  A Bobo?  Call it your Bobo.  Yes.  I see new name on the Opie Anthony message report.  Bobo.  Harry Bobo.  Harry Bobo.  I don't have hair.  Harry Bobo.  I do not have hair.  Bobo fat from store.  Reynolds, what do you call her ass?  I call it there.  It's there.  She has one.  Patty, you're going to like take down your drawers? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, my God.  You got it to be in the contest, of course.  Well, how else are you going to look at the Bobo?  The Bobo.  Why do you call it the Bobo?  Because it's a nice way of calling it other than the donkey.  Ass, right.  The donkey.  The hell's going on back there that you're calling it the donkey.  The donkey.  So, Patty, what other plays were you in?  I'm fascinated.  Oh, I was in Every Man in College.  You were in Every Man in College.  And mostly in the chorus. 
[01:34:00]  Spin that around and have fun with it, people.  You were also in chorus.  So, you're a singer.  Well, yeah.  What do you sing?  What do you sing?  I sing in talent shows with the guitar and everything.  What songs?  We got a guitar?  God damn.  Do you know how to play guitar?  Yes, I do.  Get a guitar.  Go get her a guitar.  Why haven't we heard Patty sing before?  You'll find out in a few minutes.  Reynolds is hysterical, man.  What songs do you sing?  Like, give us some titles. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, God.  I remember I sang Tammy.  I remember I sang You're Adorable.  What else did I sing?  What are these songs?  I never heard of this.  A couple of songs.  If I had a hammer.  Anything.  I wrote a song once.  You wrote a song.  Yeah, but tell them.  But you haven't.  Any popular songs that anyone would know of?  She's kind of stuck in time, you know, 25 years ago.  Time in another place, too.  Another planet.  Another planet.  That's right. 
[01:35:00]  All right, we're going to get the electric guitar.  Plug in.  Plug it in.  Steve, we plug it in?  I don't believe this.  Can you play an electric guitar?  If I had a hammer.  I've never played one before.  I'd hammer in the morning.  It's mostly a 12-stream acoustical.  Hammer in the evening.  All over this land.  What an acoustical guitar did I play?  Not an electric.  What an acoustical.  This isn't going to be like Dylan going electric.  I'm used to Patty unplugged.  And this isn't exactly going to be Randy Rhoads, either, although he's my favorite guitarist 
[01:35:30]  of all time.  Great.  Aussie fans all over the place driving off the road.  I put the P in its place, and right before I pull it out, and to the face, I tell the  bitch to keep umpkin' and prepare herself for her first ump-umpkin'.  Howdy doing Ghetto Boys?  Hey, we'll try it.  We'll try anything.  Ghetto Boys.  To get away from seeing her hairy bobo.  I don't have hair.  Ladies, leave your man at home. 
[01:36:00]  Here, crank up that PA.  It's showtime at the Apollo.  That's a little out, Earl.  Nice.  We're jamming.  Wait, Steve.  All right, nice.  Let's go some feedback, Patty.  Oh, was that Patty singing?  Couldn't tell the difference.  Never mind.  Never mind.  That was, uh, that was her.  Yeah.  I don't play like that.  I play acoustical.  Of course you do.  Steve plays like that. 
[01:36:30]  Acoustical.  It's not acoustic.  All right, put the guitar on.  No, I want you to know.  I happen to...  Whatever.  Rainy Rose is one of your favorite.  Let's hear a little picket.  Strapping it on.  There you go.  Put the strap over your, uh...  I haven't played a guitar.  Excuse for shoulders.  Here she goes, though.  It's Patty Rock.  Here she goes.  All right.  I haven't touched the guitar in, like, a year.  Well, you haven't touched the song, even. 
[01:37:00]  My name is Patty.  I live on the second floor.  I'm upstairs from you.  Can I borrow food?  I'm broke.  Patty, put the strap around.  It's, like, around your arm.  But I haven't touched the guitar in two years.  You know, Patty, if you turn the lights down just right and you squint a little bit, you look just like Lisa Loeb.  I do not.  You're right.  You're right.  All right.  What are you going to sing for us, Stalker Patty? 
[01:37:30]  I don't know what to say.  What do you know how to sing?  Just play anything you know right now and sing us a little number.  We're wasting time, Patty.  Come on.  Sing us a little tune.  Go ahead.  Oh, that's attractive.  Here we go.  It's the Beatles.  No, no, go, go.  You're doing great.  I was enjoying that.  You're doing great. 
[01:38:00]  Come on, Patty.  Patty, you were doing good.  Let's go.  From the top.  All right.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't even remember the tune.  Oh, you could do it.  Hello.  John Lennon here from the grave.  I'm spitting so fast.  Could somebody put a little oil in me casket before I burn up? 
[01:38:30]  One more try.  Maybe try another song.  Another song.  You know a lot of Beatles.  Come on.  Play us some Beatles.  I'm trying to think.  That's tough enough right there.  You know Rocky Raccoon or anything?  No?  You know Rocky Raccoon or anything?  Back into his own room.  Don't need to. 
[01:39:00]  You know Rocky Raccoon or anything?  You know Rocky Raccoon or anything?  With a gun.  He'll shoot off the legs of his rival.  His rival, it seems, have broken.  His dreams are stealing the girl with his fancy.  Ah, Steve, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  My name is McGill and I'm starving and can't pay the rent.  Hey, Patty.  Patty.  I'm so embarrassed.  Oh, poor Patty. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, Steve.  Hey, Patty, I was wondering what your stance on Napster is.  There's nothing wrong with Napster.  People don't mind us with coffee there, Scott.  I will die if Stalker Patty ends up on Napster.  That'll be great.  All right.  For your time, Mr. Borg.  All right, thanks.  Patty, loosen up.  Give us one more try because I really want to get a song out of you here.  It's either that or we got to check out the bobo.  Yeah.  One song.  I'll go 50s.  All right.  All right.  Fine.  Anything.  Go 50s.  Those are easy to remember. 
[01:40:00]  It's just like heaven, being here with you.  You're like an angel, too good to be true.  You're like an angel, too good to be true.  You're like an angel, too good to be true.  But after all, I love you, I do.  You're like an angel, too good to be true. 
[01:40:30]  But after all, I love you, I do.  You're like an angel, too good to be true.  You're like an angel, too good to be true. 
[01:41:00]  You're like an angel, too good to be true.  He's like an angel, too good to be true.  You got cats back there?  Jim Norton. 
[01:41:30]  Patty.  Patty?  Can you hear Jim, Patty?  All right.  You seem like Dave Ruth two days before he died.  It wasn't actually bad.  Your voice kind of flows like the diuretic evacuation of a leukemia patient.  He's a comedian.  I actually liked it, though.  Do you know a song called, Hey, Roto-Rooter, Man, Get Away From There? 
[01:42:00]  It's my c**t.  No, I know.  Can you sing it?  Wow!  Oh, my God, Norton.  You got to jump out of that.  Oh, you got to jump?  You can't say that?  No, you can't use the c-word like that.  Even I know that.  Jesus, that is great.  Keep up the good work, Patty.  I just wanted to say hello.  Oh, Jim, you're the best.  Hi, Jim.  Jim Norton.  Dan from Hoboken, the real day the music died, March 14, 2001. 
[01:42:30]  No, I really can sing, but when I'm nervous, I have nothing to do with that.  Of course, of course.  We understand.  Can we see your bobo?  Sure.  Good job, Patty.  Playing and singing.  I haven't touched the guitar in two years, though.  Two years?  Oh, it was obvious, but I don't want me to do it.  No, I'm just kidding.  She did okay, right?  Good job.

[01:52:00]  a lot of people like staying here  right there's a hotel i i i frequent  and i just figured they'd have a room for me last night  right  oh they were sold out  uh-oh  they were sold out  now i need to find a new hotel  and i'm a little buzzed and a little tired  and i just need to find a room  so you didn't want to start making calls  and  find another hotel  so i went to um...  the crack hotel across the street  i can't believe you stayed there 
[01:52:30]  ben was mortified  you stayed at the crack hotel  ben prides himself on knowing new york  and knowing where like the hip clubs are  he'll tell you where all the cigar joints are  he knows all this crap  he knows where the hip hotels are  he knows which hotels you should stay away from  because you know  as ben said the sheets are filled with  you  i didn't say it so don't dump out  man batter  man batter 
[01:53:00]  man batter  man batter all over the uh... the sheets  so uh...  so  i was tired and might  you know no rooms in the hotel are you so i don't want to cross the street to the crack hotel  did you see one of those real tight curled up black pubes on your pillow  nothing no worse than knowing that a acidic jewel fouled a hooker there about an hour before  this place is such a dump  such a dump and i'm in the lobby and you get all these  you get all the rubes from all over the place that are coming to new york for the first time 
[01:53:30]  and they think because this hotel is uh... close to times square that they're assuming it's a good hotel  because the lobby looks good  yeah  it's art deco anthony i believe  oh yes art deco  yeah they make the lobby look uh... look good  that means they just haven't remodeled it since art deco was new  these people have no clue  what the rooms look like until they get upstairs and they're in for a rude awakening  here's the key to toilets down the hall 
[01:54:00]  sheets of ten bucks extra  it's one step above that  seriously  there's a rotary phone  there's a rotary phone  a rotary phone  in the room  right next to the bed  huge  huge mirror  uh-oh  huge mirror  that's a bad sign  you can see opie asleep in his hotel bed on the internet somewhere  huge mirror  ridiculously  yeah i mean it was the it was the whole wall 
[01:54:30]  after signing his very lucrative contract  opie decides to spend in the tens of dollars on a hotel room  staying here in midtown manhattan  at the flush crack hotel  no expenses spared as man batter stains abound  in this luxurious crap hole 
[01:55:00]  you know what you've gotten yourself into when you grab the sticky doorknobs  and that mirror next to the bed  full of video equipment  and for a special surprise open the closet you'll see a dead hooker  freshly killed  the crack hotel  you just signed your contract 
[01:55:30]  let me get this straight  it's right after the show we just signed our deal  yeah  feeling pretty good about ourselves  of course  and you stay at a crack hotel  basically i yeah  yeah  yeah  air conditioning was busted so i'm sweating all night  oh  sticky sheets  i uh...  located near the carnegie deli for all your pot needs  and i also knew that i had to wear the same clothes today so i wanted to keep them nice and fresh for today 
[01:56:00]  opie's wardrobe never getting in the way  look at this closet  full of nothing  so we wear the same cigar smelling shirt he wore last night  and my underwear and my socks  i always want to sleep i want to sleep in that stuff i hate sleep i think it's what what h 
[01:56:30]  doing in your sleep that wouldn't keep them as fresh as when before you slept  you know you sweat a lot during the day I had to kind of you know rinse them out a little bit  and put them on the heater like a soup kitchen in your pants you're a pisser wait a minute but 
[01:57:00]  remember the sheets the undies you know they kind of look like used shoe shine rags you know take  care of stuff and I would have slept had to in my clothes in the bed shoes everything I know that  the AC I finally got it to work and I got blown up some air to kind of keep my clothes fresh airing  out the clothes the sheets didn't fit the mattress so I woke up the middle night to sleep on this 
[01:57:30]  crappy mattress sweating like a pig oh my god wait the bare mattress oh yeah oh you got a disease  you have a disease it was the worst the w you know outside my window  where most hotels serve crabs in the dining area opie got his in the bed  all this and complimentary bloodstain removal 
[01:58:00]  a place to hang your underwear while you sleep naked in our petri dish bed  all at the crack hotel in midtown manhattan  any stray pubes ben thinks ben thinks that this hotel is used by all the hookers the drive-by 
[01:58:30]  hookers that we're talking about a few weeks oh yeah oh yeah no doubt in my mind and yeah the w was  flashing outside my uh... window all night long neon light  right  he's like oh i can't even get to sleep  so then i wake up in the morning just drenched in like sweat on on the mattress  just think if you were in there with a hooker what they did before that  all kinds of body fluids body fluids abound in this luxury suite

He did the kick, and I saw like a stream of light, and there's dragons behind us.  Like, I'm seeing nothing.  I'm seeing a great show, but that's about it.  I get in the parking lot.  I'm like, dude, you guys are effed up.  I'm driving home.  It's raining.  It's pouring rain.  I pull out.  I remember this story.  The second I hit Hempstead Turnpike, the wipers are going. 
[02:18:00]  Right, right.  And the taillights of the other cars in the water on the windshield was like a kaleidoscope.  Was it like a warming experience?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, because normally I would have been petrified, but, you know, you're on the dope.  What about the time you didn't leave the parking lot because you thought something was going  to happen?  There was an imaginary field around you or something?  Oh, that wasn't me.  That was a friend of mine.  Imaginary field?  Yeah.  No, he was tripping so bad.  He started crying and saying, there's too many cars.  There's too many cars. 
[02:18:30]  And instead of going, let me drive.  I'm okay.  You go, come on, dick.  Don't be a pussy.  Get me home.  But you guys couldn't leave the imaginary area, right?  Between like four light poles or something?  No, that was Brewer.  With the darkness.  That was Brewer's story?  Oh, okay.  Jim Brewer got all...  Jim Brewer?  Oh, yeah.  Brewer's doing drugs at the National Coliseum.  And his friend took him around the parking lot.  They were walking.  And he told him to go by this light and smoke something.  Right, right, right.  I don't know exactly what the story was.  And there's the oil stains in the parking spaces. 
[02:19:00]  And Brewer's like, this mother effer wants me to walk into the darkness.  I'm not walking into the darkness because I know he's the devil.  And he believed it.  Right, right, right.  It freaks you out.  It was a 10-30 waiter.  Quaker saying, going into the darkness.  It's the darkness, man.  Fox head.  One man on drugs in a parking lot.  Get ready on NBC tonight.  Walking into the darkness.  Brian also, Dark Angel.  Back to back.  Get ready. 
[02:19:30]  That's the guy.  I'm doing it for CBS, Bill, but, you know.  Into the darkness.  They could get you cheap instead of that guy.  They pay me.  I drive all Christchown.  I go, are you ready on CBS, King of Queens?  And then I leave and they pay me.  Action.  That's the only thing that guy could do for a living.  He couldn't be like a mechanic or anything, you know.  Hey, how much for that transmission?  An arm, Evelyn.  All right, that's enough.  Definitely, he's got the same voice.  And then there are those different inflections he puts on it, 
[02:20:00]  depending on what the movie is.  That's right.  He can be like all happy.  Are you ready?  Here they come, all together from Disney Pictures.  It can be like, you know.  Everything in the city.  You must fight to survive.  He sold tortillas on the corner.  And the mob wanted him.  I don't know who this guy is, but when him and his tortillas, dead.  He had one chance, and his chance was to fight back Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
[02:20:30]  Listen to me.  These tortillas, you have to get out of here.  They're trying to kill you.  Get out.  Get out.  Little tortilla boy.  And the silence is coming everywhere.  Action.  That's great, man.  Just imagine a guy making you breakfast in the morning.  Two eggs are beaten beyond recognition.  Dude, you're evil.

When Ron calls, we'll explain the whole thing.  It's not like a wacky, like that's why we have this, it's wacky alert, you know.  Oh, wack-zene-erific radio.  Well, it's some guy that works for another show bought that pinball machine for Opie because  Opie wasn't giving him enough attention.  How sick is that? 
[02:22:30]  I don't give him any attention because I just don't like him.  It's the producer for the next show that comes on at 7.  So he bought you, like, that's a vintage machine.  Oh, yeah.  That's like, yeah.  We got a call earlier from Cleveland that's in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, that exact  time.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I swear to God.  And Opie can't stand the guy.  Someone offered us $1,200 for it.  No, it's not about the money.  It's worth about $28 right now.  It's huge, yeah.  Opie can't stand the guy.  He's going to smash it.  And, you know, he's told the guy to leave him alone.  He's almost like a stalker for Opie. 
[02:23:00]  Someone's playing a deadly game on Opie.  Get ready.  We should play the Rolling Stones song he sang to me last night.  Yeah, this is...  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you, Pablo.  It's weird, the weirdness.  Like, how old is he?  I don't know.  30, maybe?  He's 30-something, yeah.  I don't even know.  Someone's playing a deadly game again.  So he bought me the pinball machine to get, I don't know, my attention, and I don't want  to play the pinball machine, and I'm embarrassed now.  Would you spend that much money on a chick, you know? 
[02:23:30]  What?  Yes, it was.  She better be the best goddamn play you've ever had.  She better be a porno star.  You ever had sex with a TV on, and the TV's playing, because you just got deep into the  sex, and you can hear the...  And you're like...  Oh, yeah.  Three's Company sounds like porno music.  You're going to get the effect on the guitar, huh? 
[02:24:00]  You bastard, you're going to make me come back in the city to see you now.  Are you going to come in?  I swear to God, I was just faking that.  Yeah, I'm going to go see you.  But now I've got to go see you.  Yeah, yeah, come on in.  Yeah, we'll see you.  Who's not going to go see him now?  So, yeah, he buys the pinball machine, $3,000, blah, blah, blah.  It's been a soap opera that's been going on for months.  I mean, the kid broke the foosball table that you saw out there. 
[02:24:30]  Who broke that?  Yeah, the same guy.  Al Dukes, his name is, that bought Opie the machine.  He was in here one night during the Ron and Fez show.  Right.  And they got him drunk.  I don't know exactly how this happened.  He kissed another man.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  He freaks out about his sexuality.  Because they tricked him, supposedly.  They tricked him.  Yeah.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  They tricked him.  I didn't know.  So he runs outside and tips over the foosball table and breaks it. 
[02:25:00]  Okay, so this guy, what's his name again?  Luke.  Al Dukes.  Al Dukes.  And he's kissing men.  And freaking out.  And then breaking our stuff because he's pissed off about it.  Al Dukes.  That could be a movie.  Out of the closet, into the streets.  One man.  One producer.  One kiss.  He was a homie.  He was a homosexual.  Action.  Get ready for Al Dukes' sequel, Gangbangers. 
[02:25:30]  I've got to say that.  I've got to tip my foosball thing over.  Yeah, so now he's all pissed off that Opie isn't giving him attention.  Someone reminded me, Tim, on Line 7, I know the Ron and Fez people are here.  Ronnie's not.  Fez, he has already said that we could smash the pinball machine.  I'm waiting for Ron's blessing.  Are you really going to do this?  You're really going to smash it?  I mean, you're going to take a hammer.  We just met you, right?  Let me tell you something.  He's frigging insane.  And any time people that he doesn't quite get along with or like or enjoy their company 
[02:26:00]  gives him a gift, he smashes it, usually right in front of him.  There's this pathetic mess called Stalker Patty.  It gets really unoutable.  Who stalks him.  And every occasion, even Groundhog Day, she brings in a little gift.  What about the Christmas gift, Anthony?  The Christmas gift this year.  The Godiva chocolates and the homemade.  It was Godiva chocolates and she made a little frame with glass on it and kind of used an  ink glue gun and drew some nice stuff on it. 
[02:26:30]  So she talks.  And here, Opie, I'm giving this to you.  Happy birthday.  Merry Christmas, whatever occasion it is.  Opie goes, oh, great.  This is nice.  Just tapping it a little.  All right.  Wham!  Just smashes it right in front of her and she starts crying.  She cries.  Yet she comes back every time.  You've got to get some of this on tape.  It's like an Opie cam.  Well, then I did the thing with the Godiva chocolate.  Yeah, and then Godiva chocolate.  It's like, how much can you mess that up?  He takes the cover off, puts it on the floor, pulls it out and just leaks on it. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, God.  On the chocolate that she brought in.  What flavor is this?  I don't know.  This is an interesting filling.  Quite lemon lime.  Chocolate is sweating.  Urine everywhere. </pre>
