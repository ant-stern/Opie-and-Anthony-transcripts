<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed their chaotic experience at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs).  The centerpiece of the show revolved around their stunt of sending two women, referred to repeatedly and offensively as "retarded Laverne and Shirley" or "Lady Di and Marion," to conduct interviews on the red carpet.  This resulted in a series of comically inept and often offensive interactions with numerous celebrities, including Janet Jackson, Mick Jagger, Will Ferrell, Alicia Keys, Little Moe, Nate Dogg (mistakenly identified as Kato Kaelin), the Backstreet Boys, Ja Rule, Fatboy Slim, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and  John Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora (whose strong reactions were a recurring gag).  Audio clips of these interviews were played throughout the broadcast.  The hosts discussed the varying levels of celebrity engagement with the press, ranging from enthusiastic to outright avoidance.  They recounted their own past experiences at award shows, including being ejected from a Grammys after-party.

The show also featured a mix of in-studio guests and phone calls.  Guests included Kimmy from *Survivor* (Australia), described as a "nympho freak," who engaged in sexually suggestive banter;  Mike from *Real World: New York*, who appeared in multiple segments sharing anecdotes from the VMAs after-party, including one involving Christina Aguilera; Mario Cantone; and musician John Valby, who performed several songs with explicit lyrics. Bennington shared stories from a *Sex and the City* wrap party and other events, highlighting instances of exclusion and financial difficulties.  The hosts frequently engaged in crude jokes, sexual innuendo, and homophobic and misogynistic slurs, with listeners participating in similar offensive commentary during phone calls.  The conversation also included discussions of Mariah Carey's perceived lack of live performance talent, Britney Spears' VMA performance, new radio censorship rules (leading to a call to their boss Ken Stevens to complain), and various parties attended, including those hosted by P. Diddy and at the VMAs.  They also discussed other celebrity encounters, including Ann Heche (described as having "schizophrenic tendencies"), Tommy Hilfiger (who was mocked), Jason Sehorn, Destiny's Child, Montel Williams, Carson Daly, Jimmy Kimmel, Kelly Ripa, Andrew Cuomo, and a near-miss encounter with Howard Stern.  Triumph the Insult Comic Dog's VMAs commentary was also aired.  The hosts mentioned posting numerous photos from the event on their website.  Numerous commercials were aired, including those for Rockaway Bedding and Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed, and a promotion for WNEW's fall lineup and Paisano of Mulberry Street.  The show concluded with a discussion about a fan's tattoo of Opie's face and a shout-out to Ron and Fez.  The hosts also repeatedly referenced the "Retard of the Vernage, Shirley" as a recurring comedic bit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Well, you guys are both stupid. You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be on heroin.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  Fields of love.  Uh-huh.  Hey, man.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Ha-ha-ha.  Wow.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Let's get this out of the way.  Get some phone numbers out there, and we'll move on with the festivities today.  We've got so much to talk about today, it's not even funny.  If you're thinking of not listening to us today, you're crazy.  Right.  Absolutely crazy.  All right.  If you're in the New York area, give us a call.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-277-436.  Wow. 
[00:01:00]  What a night.  Well, last we left you, we were outside the VMA Awards.  Yes.  At the Met here in New York City.  And things started heating up just as we were going off the air right ahead.  Yeah.  You know, we got there yesterday, I guess.  Way too early, by the way.  Yeah, way too early.  Way too early.  Like four, a little after four.  It was us and a bunch of really hot chicks taping TRL. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, and then the festivities didn't really get started, the red carpet and all that crap,  till, what, 6.30?  Like a half hour or 45 minutes before we went off the air?  Yeah.  So we got a few things in at the end, but for the most part, we were just tooling the  retarded Laverne and Shirley, who we brought with us to conduct the interviews right on  the side of the red carpet with the various celebrities that were going to the VMAs last 
[00:02:00]  night.  I got to interrupt you really fast.  Read in the email before the show.  And most of the listeners absolutely loved yesterday's show.  They thought the Laverne and Shirley stuff was just outrageous and just over the top and  hilarious, right?  There are a few people writing saying, you guys completely blew it.  Why did you have those two retards interviewing the celebrities?  This was your chance to talk to a lot of these big wigs.  You never had big wigs on your radio show.  Big wigs.  What's the deal, guys?  You really blew it yesterday.  We got to explain something to you guys. 
[00:02:30]  We knew this was going to happen.  None of these celebrities stopped.  There was a whole red carpet.  Yeah.  We had our own section, which was just awesome.  Thank you, MTV.  And then to our right, they put the rest of the media.  We had our own spot.  Yeah, we had our own little blocked off area where it was just our show.  Right.  And then next to us was where they keep cattle.  Everyone.  Everyone.  Teen Beat, Seventeen, Entertainment Weekly. 
[00:03:00]  And they were fighting each other to get close to the rail that was right next to the red carpet.  Meanwhile, we're right there.  Right.  They really hooked us up.  Let me tell you what happens at these things.  And I haven't been to many, but I have an observation.  Wait, wait, wait.  When you say you haven't been to many of these red carpet events, how many have you been to?  Actual red carpet events?  Yeah.  Events?  Yesterday was the break.  One.  Exactly.  Me too.  We've been to some of these things, like the Grammys.  Let's not forget the time we got kicked off the board at Spago in L.A.  Yeah.  At the Grammys. 
[00:03:30]  Because we weren't, you know, important enough to stand on a piece of wood.  We didn't rate to even look at the people that were going into Spago out in L.A.  When we were working in Boston, they flew us out to L.A. for the Grammys.  Yeah.  And we found out where the after-hour party was, and one of the big ones was at Spago,  and they had bleachers set up.  We knew we couldn't get in, but we figured we'd hang out and watch who was going inside.  Right.  So we stood up on a piece of wood.  It was pretty much a two-by-six.  Top row of the bleachers, we were outside the actual bleachers on this piece of wood, 
[00:04:00]  because you had to go through some people to get into the bleachers.  Yeah, so we didn't even figure we would get that.  No, so we snuck behind and climbed up.  Oh, we weren't important enough to stand on that piece of wood.  They kicked us out.  You can't stand there.  Get off.  But we're Opey and Anthony, and we do a radio show.  Get off the wood.  But we do a radio show.  We're supposed to be here.  Look at our laminants.  Our laminants.  We didn't even have those.  We had nothing.  We stink. 
[00:04:30]  So, yeah, last night, we were right there.  They hooked us up.  And we brought the retarded Laverne and Shirley,  because, like Ope says, these people aren't stopping.  They aren't stopping.  They stop when their publicist takes them through.  Every celebrity you see walking through with their posse,  one of those people, at least one of them, is a publicist.  They scout out who's down the line.  If they see a photographer from Rolling Stone, 
[00:05:00]  and they know all these people,  they will bring their person over.  They will stand.  They will smile.  They will do that chick,  turn their head around like Linda Blair shot,  so they can take the picture.  You notice that, how all the girls do that move?  They stand, and then they turn their head all the way around  so they can get their face and their ass in the picture.  Perfect.  At the same time.  So their publicist knows that.  When the publicist sees the likes of us,  they run block.  They completely run block on them.  Most of the publicists that were outside the VMAs yesterday, 
[00:05:30]  no sense of humor whatsoever.  Yeah.  None.  None.  The African princess publicist blew us off every single time.  What was the problem?  Your people can't have fun with us?  They didn't want their peeps coming over to us,  so we weren't going to sit there.  Should we read off the people that were at the VMAs last year  and the year before and find out where they are today?  Right.  Go back a couple of years.  This whole thing has a short lifespan.  Yes.  And they're taking it way too serious. 
[00:06:00]  Come on up and have fun with us.  That's what we're all about.  No, they're very serious.  So this is the deal at these red carpet events.  Like you have, I would say, like second-rate celebrities in general  walking the red carpet.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  Well, actually, there's three stages.  Yeah.  The celebrities that will stop and talk to people along the red carpet.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Then you have the celebrities that will just walk the red carpet  and make play.  Oh, hey, I would love to talk, but look, I'm late.  I've got to get in there.  Right, right. 
[00:06:30]  Hey, oh, no, I'd love to.  Oh, they do the what, what, what?  Yeah.  Well, they point at their watch.  Well, they point at the door they're walking towards.  Right.  Like, I can't talk.  I can't talk.  The best move, and we have, I've got to admit,  we've pulled this one off ourselves.  What?  You act like you want to talk.  Yeah.  You act like you want to talk.  Like, wait, no, I've got to talk to these guys.  Look, they're cool.  And then you have the guy that's part of your posse  that has to be the bad guy and sweep you along.  And then you're left there like, look, shrugging your shoulders. 
[00:07:00]  Like, look, I'd love to talk to you, but look, he's pushing me in.  I've got to go.  This a-hole is screwing up the program.  Celebrity had no intention of talking to those reporters,  but that's how he handled it.  And third is the superstar.  Third, well, yeah, third is the celebrities that they're too good  for the red carpet, so they actually walk on the outside of the red carpet,  on the other side.  Yeah, away from the press.  From where the media and the press is.  I never knew this before last night.  You would think the red carpet's the red carpet.  That's where all the big celebrities come in. 
[00:07:30]  No, there is a tier of celebrity that is better than the red carpet.  And if they're walking down the red carpet, to their right,  the whole red carpet's fenced in with the red velvet ropes and whatnot.  To the right of those velvet ropes, off the carpet, is a walkway  that the likes of Janet Jackson walk on.  You know, the upper echelon of celebrity.  Right.  And that's it.  We think Britney Spears walked by us.  We're not really sure. 
[00:08:00]  I swear to God, it's a joke.  I know it was her.  She ran by with two huge black guys over her.  They were over her.  It looked like a rape.  I think I caught her calf.  Yeah.  I think we saw her calf.  So they weren't stopping.  So getting back to why we even went this way on the conversation.  This was the only way to do this.  Yeah.  We weren't going to stand there and be humiliated by having these people just blow us off.  Right.  They're blowing off the retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[00:08:30]  Who cares?  What would you rather hear?  Ant and I on the red carpet making fools of ourselves going, Janet, Janet, Janet, can  we talk to Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet, Jackson, Janet.  All right.  There she goes.  Mick, Mick, Mick Jagger.  Mick, Mick, Mick.  That was Mick Jagger.  But we do a radio show.  It's sink, it's sink, it's sink.  Wait, can we talk to him?  We would have sounded like tools yesterday.  So instead...  Bigger tools than we normally do.  Yeah.  Instead, we brought you the retarded Laverne and Shirley, and they did a great job.  I love those two.  I really love those two. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  Love them.  No, hey, hey, shh.  I know.  Don't say that.  I know.  I mean, we abused them pretty well, but you know what?  They did the job for us yesterday, and they should be applauded today.  I can't stand them, but they do a great job for us.  So that was the reason we did that, because we knew we weren't going to talk to anyone  really that bad.  The people that stopped were the ones that were desperate, that needed some press.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  Anyway, lots of email coming in.  And the Washington Post wrote about the VMAs. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  I want to thank Scott Fabian, it looks like.  Scott writes, ONA, I was listening to the debacle at yesterday's VMAs.  Too bad you couldn't have pulled more airtime.  Oh, no.  We taped from 7 to 8.  We got audio out the A, right, that we're going to play for you guys in a little bit.  That is awesome stuff.  There's an article in today's Washington Post about the show, the VMAs.  Don't bother reading the entire article, but I think your girls made the paper.  Please see the highlighted piece at the end of the article.  So you go to the end of the article in the Washington Post today. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And this is us, by the way.  Fortunately, there was plenty of room for P. Diddy to make a grand entrance on an 18-wheeler.  Alien and Farm played on a stage near the fountain,  while television reporters frantically try to figure out who was famous and who was just extremely thin.  The questions tended to focus on clothing, even when the clothing was utterly pedestrian.  One reporter asked a member of boy band O-Town where he got his outfit.  This is a T-shirt from SeaWorld in San Diego, he replied, a little bewildered. 
[00:10:30]  That was our girls, man.  Yeah.  I think that was Marion who said that.  That was our girls, making the Washington Post.  Our girls.  Could you not put it in that way?  Look, I know they did a great job.  It was a lot of fun.  But this affection you're getting for them is frightening me.  And I really, I don't want to go that way with it.  I feel like a proud bus driver.  You know, like the guy that drives a short bus around and one of the special kids with the hockey helmet does something a little special. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  You kind of feel good.  I don't know.  You feel good about yourself.  I still like wrapping them in the side of the head with their hockey helmet.  I still like jamming on the brakes and watching them fly their drooled face into the back of the seat.  It's like, oh, look, they tied their own shoes today.  Three loops per shoe.  But look, they did it.  You feel proud.  Right.  Okay.  They accomplished something.  I feel good today.  I'm with you on that. 
[00:11:30]  Can you put it in my backpack, please?  Aaron, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How about it?  I want to see you guys.  I know you guys did it before the show.  Did you guys actually see the show?  Well, we're going to get into all of that, man.  Triumphly insult comic dog?  We just watched the show in the back office because we ended up going inside.  Well, it was Ant and I, Rick, Ben, and our security, our personal security, Keith, the cop.  We got some in his best Miami Vice wear.  Right.  Fan laughing. 
[00:12:00]  We got to ask Keith what we can and can't say because I don't want to get him in trouble with his job.  So we went into the show.  We saw U2's performance.  That was it.  Yeah, that's all we saw.  That's all we wanted to see.  The rest of the time was spent outside the actual place where you watch the show in the bar areas, the various bar areas.  And that's where everyone is.  The celebrities, they barely watch this thing.  You know, there's the people that are nominated and stuff. 
[00:12:30]  They watch because they might have to accept an award.  But for the most part, everyone's outside drinking.  Yeah, the place was set up where you could just leave and there's just a huge bar and a huge hangout area.  There's a few bars.  Yeah.  The downstairs bar, no one was going to.  We'll get into all the stories in a little bit.  But that's what we were doing.  We were just hanging.  And we were doing what's called stick and move.  We'd go to this area for a while, see what's going on.  Okay, nothing's going on here.  Let's go upstairs for a little while.  Okay, nothing's going on here.  Ooh, look who just passed us by.  Ooh, he looks pissed.  Ooh, wow.  His new chick is really hot.  Okay. 
[00:13:00]  All right, nothing else to see here.  Let's go back downstairs to the bar.  That was good.  Hey, guys, one more thing.  Yes, Aaron?  You guys sounded great raw last night on Ron and Fez.  Well, we didn't even know that we were on.  But that was the best part of it.  All right.  I hope it sounded okay.  It did.  Thanks, Aaron.  Later, guys.  All right.  I just want to get through a few of these, and then we'll talk about what we saw during  the show.  Okay?  Yeah.  Jersey Gary.  Ran into a lot of people.  Hey, how you doing, O&E?  All right. 
[00:13:30]  I'd just like to congratulate Ant.  Why's that?  Who did you vote for, I guess, online there, Ant?  Oh, the Viewer's Choice Award nominees?  That's right.  I believe I cast my vote, my goof vote, for NSYNC.  Who won?  NSYNC won.  I hope it was by more than one vote.  I'd hate to think I'd put him over the top.  Did you see when Michael Jackson came out?  Oh, yeah.  That was like the most pathetic thing out there.  It looked like he had some body work done to him.  Well, Anthony made an observation. 
[00:14:00]  NSYNC was whiter than Michael Jackson.  No, Michael Jackson, whiter than NSYNC.  I mean, Michael, sorry.  I just...  Yeah.  Yeah, they were all darker than Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson, pure white now.  He's like that...  What was that movie?  Powder?  Yeah.  Can he bend spoons and whatnot?  Let's go to John.  John, what's up?  Yo, over there.  Yo, what's up with Chris Walken?  How many times did he say wow, wow, wow?  Wow, wow, wow.  I think we have that.  Hold on a sec. 
[00:14:30]  Wow.  Wowie, wow, wow, wow.  Did he look at you about the panic?  Huh?  I thought he was about the panic.  Yeah, he didn't say much up there.  I won't read your cue card.  Hey, he walked by our position on the red carpet, and you got to hear what Lady Diane Marion said to him.  No way.  They're such...  They offered him a twiggy.  They are asses.  They were just out of their minds.  Thanks, John.  All right, you're doing great.  You're good.  All right, bro.  They were very starstruck, by the way, the retarded Laverne and Shirley, very starstruck, and they're not professional. 
[00:15:00]  They don't know how to do interviews, so all they're doing is yelling at these people, and the second a lot of these people got a little inkling to come over, they would look at them and run for their lives.  Right.  A lot of people were scared off and just giving them weird looks.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Guys, yesterday was brilliant.  Oh, that was a lot of fun.  You know, it was like the regular guy gets to go to the big party, and retarded Laverne and Shirley, it was hilarious. 
[00:15:30]  Listening to you guys laugh so hard, and I was laughing, might have been, you know, next to Mario Cantone, I think that's about as funny as you guys get.  It was brilliant.  It was, besides it being a lot of fun, it was just cringe radio at its best for us, because they were getting themselves into some crazy situations, and Ant and I just wanted to crawl away.  I honestly couldn't watch.  We had nowhere to go. We had nowhere to go. We would bend our heads down. One time I ducked under the table when they were talking to Dale Earnhardt, Jr. 
[00:16:00]  Who are you?  Who are you?  I'm Dale Earnhardt, Jr.  Who?  Who? What do you do?  Dale Earnhardt, Jr.  Oh, I'm sorry I hear about your father.  That was beautiful.  It was hilarious, and I'm a publicity guy. In fact, I'm the guy you guys tooled around when I was trying to get Gutenberg on the air.  Yeah.  And let me tell you something. You're right. They've got to just calm down. I mean, who do these people think they are? I think it's great.  If I'd seen you guys and I was walking, I might have lost the client, but I would have brought him right over. I think you guys were brilliant. 
[00:16:30]  It's just weird. I mean, just because you're a celebrity and you're a big name, that means you can't have a little fun.  Oh, please. But it was brilliant. Keep it up, guys. You're getting better every day.  Thanks. Like the insult dog making fun of...  Carson.  Well, Carson took it well.  Uh-huh.  We talked to Carson. That was cool, too.  Yeah.  But then the insult comic was talking to J-Lo, and she had no sense of humor.  No, well, the insult dog wanted to sniff her butt.  Right.  And she pushed it away. 
[00:17:00]  Not even in, like, a cute, like, ha-ha-ha, get out of my face.  No, it was...  It was like, get the ass out of my face.  Right?  Yeah.  We're just waiting for Rick to come in with all the clips from the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  The stuff you guys missed when we went off the air at 7.  You know what I had to do when they were doing a lot of the interviews?  We were standing up on chairs so we could see who was coming to alert the retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[00:17:30]  All right, here's who's coming.  Right.  So we were behind them and elevated.  Right.  Now, a lot of the people walking by couldn't tell the difference between the regular press area,  which was crammed with different news organizations and whatnot, and our area.  So they didn't know that the retarded Laverne and Shirley were with us.  We're in the same area, but we're kind of back behind a table.  So I actually took my mic flag off, the thing that has the radio station's calls on the mic,  so they would not think I was with them. 
[00:18:00]  And as they're talking, I swear to God, I wasn't even looking at them talking to them.  I wanted to distance myself from these two retards talking to these people because it was embarrassing.  Yeah.  It was really embarrassing.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Who's that?  I like it.  What are you wearing?  I've just been handed a list of the clips we're going to hear on today's show.  Rick is almost done with them.  We have interactions between the retarded Laverne and Shirley and the following people, okay? 
[00:18:30]  This is a partial list.  Excuse me.  Alicia Keys, Nate Dogg, Will Ferrell, the Backstreet Boys, O-Town, Alter Boy.  My favorite.  For you here in New York.  Yes.  J-Roll, Fatboy Slim, a Nobody VIP.  That was funny.  Will Ferrell again.  Will Ferrell again.  Andy Dick, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Janet Jackson, Linkin Park.  The Linkin Park stuff's classic. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Tech from Real World Hawaii, Carrot Top, Bon Jovi, Mick Jagger, believe it or not.  Barely, but there's a little interaction there.  Tommy Hilfiger, when you hear what they ask him.  Yeah.  Holy yes.  What about Mudvayne?  Mudvayne's on here, right?  Did we get the Mudvayne?  I don't know.  Mudvayne.  Oh, Mudvayne.  Uh, Jason Sehorne, Destiny's Child.  Montel Williams? 
[00:19:30]  I don't remember the Montel Williams.  Yeah.  They were yelling.  It was really funny.  They were yelling at Montel.  And Kelly Ripa, of course.  Kelly Ripa.  From Regis.  Uh, Andrew Como.  Yep.  So, uh, we're going to start playing these clips very, very soon.  We're just waiting for Rick to get it on the machine and we'll, we'll be ready to go.  Mm-hmm.  But, uh, priceless, priceless stuff.  Yeah.  And the fun inside after, uh, the red carpet.  Well, you want to take a break and we can get into this whole mess?  Yeah.  Okay, man.  Uh, today is the day to listen without a doubt.  Also, coming in today, Mario Cantone? 
[00:20:00]  Yes.  We love Mario Cantone.  John Valvey outside.  And John Valvey's outside?  John Valvey's here?  Yep.  He's going to play a little background stuff for us today?  Mm-hmm.  Very nice.  Stay there.  Something strange is happening here.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Guess what's in teens' pants. 
[00:20:30]  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  You two rocked on the awards last night.  Almost got my OK Terrific on when Bono was talking about the Ramones.  Like there was a little lull in this conversation.  It got real quiet.  And we were up on the second balcony and I screamed, OK Terrific!  And you could hear the OK. 
[00:21:00]  And then Bono talks over my Terrific, the bastard.  You could definitely hear it if you tape the VMAs.  You could hear it very faintly in the background.  That's Anthony.  And then everyone turned around in our section and what did you say?  Oh, I yelled it out really loud.  And yeah, people like turned around like, what is that?  And I just looked.  I like scanned them and just went, sit down.  Turn around.  Like we were all belligerent.  I'm so surprised we didn't get heaped out of there. 
[00:21:30]  At that point we were pretty buzzed.  Not as buzzed as the girl behind us on the cell phone, though.  What an idiot.  What an ass.  She's got her cell phone.  She's talking to friends.  She goes, U2's on.  Listen.  And she holds her cell phone out.  You know, everyone has done that at concerts for their friends and stuff.  Dude.  It's like, yeah, U2's on.  Listen.  And we turn around like, idiot, this is on TV.  Turn on TV.  You'll hear it really good.  I just turned around and go, shh.  Yeah, Ben's like, shh.  Shut up.  Cell phone. 
[00:22:00]  Stupid bitch.  I was so psyched that I was able to hang out with the drunk Ben last night.  That was fun.  We weren't actually totally drunk.  Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.  Not that you were like over the top, wasted, but it's always fun to hang out with you when  you've had a few beers.  Comfortable little buzz on.  When U2 screwed up, or they didn't screw up, but the technical people just before U2's performance.  Yeah.  And it was obvious there was a screw up and they quickly went to commercial.  And then they came back and we did it.  It was really uncomfortable inside the Met because you didn't know how long they went 
[00:22:30]  before they went to commercial.  Yeah.  And Ben was the first person to notice that they screwed up.  And as loud as could be, he goes, they effed up.  MTV effed up.  They effed up.  Ben's like, oh, they effed up.  Yeah.  This dude next to me is like, how do you know what you're talking about?  I'm like, shut up.  I've seen this four or five times.  They effed up.  I've seen this five other times.  But it was just like, oh, they effed up.  As loud as could be.  Yeah, we were definitely the loud people. 
[00:23:00]  A-hole.  By the way, if you're just tuning in, we have over an hour of clips from the Retard Laverne  Shirley.  Because we taped when we got off the air at 7 from 7-8 because that's when all the real  people were coming by on the red carpet.  Yeah.  And we had to go off the air yesterday, unfortunately.  So we taped everything.  And it's been quite a project today to organize this stuff and get it all together.  We're just about ready to start playing the clips.  So please hang in there, okay?  Right.  But they talked to, well, they interacted with just about everyone you saw on TV last night. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And if you thought the stuff they said on the show yesterday live was pretty amusing, just  wait to hear what they had to say after we went off the air.  Out of their effing minds.  In the meantime, we should talk about what we did after the radio show yesterday.  Some of the inside the venue moments that we had, we weren't even going to go in.  Then we just decided, ah, let's check it out for a little while.  And we got kind of caught up in the whole thing.  Yeah.  It was kind of fun. 
[00:24:00]  And they had bars, so we had some beer.  And that's all we really need to hang out and have a good time.  First thing, though, when we walk in, who do we see?  Oh, well, Ben and Rick were hilarious.  And we started off great, but then it just sucked.  We had a good strategy.  Because we are trying to get some more high-profile people on our show.  As long as they fit the show.  And here's a place where we can do a lot of schmoozing, obviously.  Yes.  And the celebrities were just hanging out with all us regular folk, man. 
[00:24:30]  Drinking beers and, you know, running to the bathroom.  Rick, for example, said hi to Pam Landerson as she was going to the bathroom.  No, no, I didn't say hi to her.  What was I doing?  I was just looking down and I see this girl and I see her ass.  So I'm like, haw.  I'm like, yeah, no crap, haw.  It was Pam Landerson.  I was like, that's a hot chick.  But Ben's the best.  Ben had a little bit of a buzz on at the time.  And we were standing by the bathroom.  And Pam Landerson walks right by to go to the bathroom.  Ben goes, hey, Pam. 
[00:25:00]  And she, like, comes over and he puts his hand out and shakes hands.  She's like, oh, hi, how are you?  How are you?  I haven't seen you in a while.  Oh, yeah.  And then walks into the bathroom.  I'm like, Ben.  Oh, Ben's the man.  I go, do you know Pam Landerson?  He's like, no, dude.  Like, I would, if you saw that, you would think that Ben just knew Pam Landerson.  And I'm looking at Ben shaking hands and talking to Pam Landerson.  You should have went for the hug.  You should have went for the hug and just grabbed her ass.  She was wearing that real low-slung dress that was almost to butt crack level. 
[00:25:30]  Looking nice going into the bathroom there.  She's just unbelievable.  Off the charts.  But I was laughing at Ben.  He's like, hey, Pam.  Hey, Pam.  How you doing?  Ben's amazing at that.  Both these guys did a great job.  So Ben and I are just hanging out like stiffs.  And Bon Jovi walks by.  John Bon Jovi and Richie Samboer.  Yeah.  And so who decided to give it a shot?  One of us.  I think we both did it at the same time.  Yeah.  So either Ben or Rick goes, hey, Bon Jovi, Opie and Anthony.  And they're celebrities. 
[00:26:00]  You figure they're just going to blow you off.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Make believe they knew us.  All of a sudden, John Bon Jovi goes, where?  He goes, get out of here.  Where?  And Rick points.  We're like 10 feet away from where you guys were.  And he comes running over.  And then Richie Samboer hears and goes, no way.  Get out of here, Opie and Anthony.  We're standing there like, huh?  And comes running over.  And the reason we bring this up is because now we're face-to-face with John Bon Jovi and  Richie Samboer, like literally three feet in front of us.  And they're telling us how much we kick ass on the radio. 
[00:26:30]  And how much they're fans of the show.  And how funny we are and that they're huge fans of the show.  And the only thing I could think in my head is like, oh my God, it's John Bon Jovi.  John Bon Jovi talking about how I think he was taking a dump and reading the Time Magazine  article.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  And then he goes, wow, man, you guys were in Time Magazine.  I'm like, well, you guys are pretty good, too.  You, too.  You, too, in some various publications.  I like what you guys do, too.  You, too. 
[00:27:00]  We had nothing.  We just suck.  That rock and roll thing you do.  That rock thing.  They're talking.  I was a couple minutes.  And I'm like, just keep it together.  Keep it together.  Yeah, they keep it together.  It was cool, yeah.  They're fans of the show.  So we're working on having them come in.  Right.  And hang out.  Not only that, then, because they'd been on Howard's show for many years.  You know, who can forget the battle with Sam Kinison over the Bon Jovi episode on Howard's  show years ago.  And some of the best radio ever by the way. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hell yeah.  It has to be said.  So John Bon Jovi says, he goes, dude, what's up with Howard, man?  You bumping him yet on the street?  Well, like, to tell you the truth, no.  He goes, because I'm reading some of these articles, and ooh, he's got to be pissed about  that.  I'm like, and we're like, you know, this guy's friends with him.  He's been on his show plenty of times.  Well, like, to tell you the truth, we never, we have not bumped into him yet.  He goes, oh, yeah?  Who would know less than an hour later? 
[00:28:00]  You know?  Coming out of the very VIP area that we just, we couldn't even stand by the door of this  area.  It just shows where we rate in this company.  And it's okay.  It's okay.  Now, let me tell you something.  There's a VIP area where all the bigwigs in the company we work for are just hanging  and eating shrimp and sushi and crab legs.  They are bringing in place.  Let me tell you what my dinner.  Crab legs as big as your arm.  I'll tell you what my dinner consisted of up until that point.  And this is no lie. 
[00:28:30]  I had a Rice Krispie Treat and a Sam Adams.  That was my dinner.  And I'm watching these waiters carrying plates of these big platters of sushi and shrimp  cocktail and crab legs and cristal.  And they're all going in.  And everyone in there, like, we got a few peeks in the door.  They're all in their Armani suits.  And we had jeans and a T-shirt.  I had jeans and a T-shirt.  Opie looked like one of the original members of the movie MASH. 
[00:29:00]  The Donald Sutherland character with the hat and the, you had the, uh, the green,  shirt on, the khaki shirt.  I had, I had, I had sandals on.  Yeah.  I had, uh, carpenter jeans.  Yep.  Uh, a green T-shirt.  And one of those little...  It had your BJ Honeycutt hat on.  Yeah.  The BJ Honeycutt hat.  Well, because we were out in the sun.  I'm like, you know, what the hell?  I'm going to, you know, I'm dressing for the sun.  We were slobs.  We didn't think we were going to be hanging with guys in Armani suits all night.  We were absolute slobs.  And we're standing there.  And, um, then we find out inside is, uh, one of the huge, 
[00:29:30]  the biggest guys in Viacom.  Viacom owns everything.  Owns MTV.  Owns Infinity Broadcasting.  Uh, and that name?  Tony Berardini.  Well, yes, he was in there, too.  No, he's our GM, uh, at, uh, WBS, BCN in Boston.  BCN in Boston.  So, we're like, we want to say hi.  You got to understand, this was the party for the company we worked for,  and they will not let us in.  No, we couldn't get in.  They will not let us in.  So, we're like, well, we just want to say hi to Tony. 
[00:30:00]  He's in there, you know?  You know, he picked up the show in Boston.  You know, he's loving, uh, loving us.  And we just want to say hi.  He's in New York, you know?  Yeah.  What the hell?  So, Ben finally goes in and drags him out,  because, uh, they just will not let us in there.  No.  So, Tony comes walking out.  He can only meet us outside the party.  Yeah.  He can, uh, and, and he's got the special pin that allows him to go into this party.  Right.  And he's got to talk to us scrubs outside the door.  So, um, we're hanging out talking to him about, uh, you know, BCN, Boston, 
[00:30:30]  and how we're, uh, beating up Rocco, and it rules.  And, um, who comes out?  Who comes out of this, this high-profile, uh, room?  Hoo-hoo himself.  Right.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Now, we see, uh, Howard.  Howard comes out with, uh, with his girlfriend,  who is really, really hot, by the way.  Beyond hot.  Yeah.  Beyond hot.  Yeah.  That, the T-100,000 model came. 
[00:31:00]  Very, very tall, uh, leggy.  Nice-looking girl.  And, um, now he knows Tony, obviously.  He's on BCN, too, in the mornings.  And, um, Tony gets this look of panic on his face.  And he's looking over.  And, you know, we're looking at Howard and his chick.  And he's just like, don't say anything.  Guys, please don't, don't go over, don't say anything.  Because Howard stopped by, I guess, an elevator or something.  We were, we were 20 feet away from each other.  And Tony, like, as quick as he could say, he's like, don't, don't say anything. 
[00:31:30]  Don't move.  Don't, don't move.  Don't move.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything.  Because here's the deal.  You know, we've butted heads a few times, uh, not in person.  But Tony figured, all right, if any confrontation happens between these guys, and I am there, I am responsible for it.  You know, oh my God, something happened between Howard, Novi, and Anthony.  And Tony Baradini was there.  You know, all of a sudden, in Mel's eyes, Tony started the whole thing.  Right.  You know, that's what would happen. 
[00:32:00]  But, so Tony just turned white, and he's like, don't say anything, don't look, don't talk, don't do anything.  But he, he turned around, and, uh, Howard was wearing his sunglasses, so he couldn't see where his eyes were going.  But, uh, he turned around and, uh, and gave a look.  And then walked off with, uh, with his girl.  That was our big, uh, confrontation.  Well, there wasn't going to be any confrontation.  No, I know that.  It was more, it was more Tony just freaking out, like, oh God, oh God.  Losing his mind.  It was like, oh God, this is my worst nightmare.  Oh my God. 
[00:32:30]  Oh my God.  Don't sit, don't, don't, don't move, don't move.  It's hilarious.  I just like that he was so scared.  Like, what the hell are you going to do?  Tackle him!  So then, uh, we were doing stick and move all night long.  Bon Jovi on the stairs, uh, you know, that whole thing.  Upstairs, uh, Pamela Anderson to the left here.  And then we would go down to the lower bar.  A lot of people, a lot of our listeners were at this thing, by the way.  You guys, you guys missed a great opportunity.  The lower bar where, where, where it was at. 
[00:33:00]  And no one was going down there.  Yeah, the, uh, the, the floor level bar was packed.  You know, very hard to get in there and get a beer.  But then we noticed, oh, there's a bar downstairs and there's barely anyone there.  The only people that were there were, uh, like a bunch of the rap dudes.  No, it was the bad boy posse.  Yeah, that's where all the dirt.  Bad boys for life.  All the dirt bags went downstairs.  It was great.  So, uh.  BMX was down there.  Yeah.  But at first, uh, Fat Boy Slim is just hanging by himself at the bar with his, with his wife.  With his wife, Zoe, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  He's just drinking at the bar.  So Ben strikes up a conversation like he's known him forever.  Yeah.  Talking to him for about ten minutes.  Fat Boy's talking to Ben.  And then, uh.  Who comes over?  Uh.  Buster Rhymes.  Buster Rhymes.  Buster Rhymes.  And then Ben does his best Letterman impression.  Yeah.  He goes, Fat Boy, this is Buster.  This is Buster.  Buster.  Fat Boy.  And they're like, hey.  And they start, so any collaboration between those two is, uh, Ben's responsible for now.  Right.  Just in case.  But then they're talking.  Fat Boy, this is so funny. 
[00:34:00]  He's talking to Fat Boy Slim.  He's like, man, you don't change.  You know, he's cursing and everything.  And, uh.  You got the boys in the hood.  You got the boys in the hood.  Listening to you.  Let me tell you.  You are street.  You got the ears of the urban community.  Don't you change ears.  Yeah.  And later on downstairs at the downstairs bar.  Oh, my God.  I went walking out. 
[00:34:30]  First, I had to get to a cash machine, which is a story we'll tell later, though.  No, we can tell it now.  What the hell?  All right.  This is how.  We are really, really.  We told you what we were wearing.  We were.  Everyone else was in their black suits.  Yeah.  We were in an environment that we're not supposed to be in.  We were like party crashes that somehow had tickets.  We were broke.  We were honestly broke.  And I'm not just talking I was broke.  Rick was broke.  All of us.  All of us.  All of us had nothing.  Like, I had a little bit of money, enough to get us started a little bit. 
[00:35:00]  Well, to be fair, we all had enough for, like, a round, which was like 40 bucks.  Yeah.  For five people.  Yeah.  So we all did our, you know, we all did the round.  And also we're realizing, oh, man.  You know, this ain't over yet.  It's 930 and we have no money.  And we have no money.  We're broke.  Meanwhile, I'm looking at these rap dudes.  I swear to God, from the stairway coming down to the bar, throwing gold money clips full of hundreds at each other.  Yo, get me some gin.  And, like, just flinging it.  Tank the rain.  Tank the rain.  Tank the rain.  And we're like...  Give me another bottle of Cristal.  And we're like, with quarters going, one, two, three, one dollar. 
[00:35:30]  One, two, three, two dollar.  One, two, three.  25, 30.  Oh, it's pathetic.  It's like, again, how much you got?  I got 20.  Ben, I got seven.  Well, at one point, we didn't even have enough money for the round, if you remember.  We didn't even have enough money for the round.  Yeah.  Keith, the cop had to, like, fess up with his money.  We had no money.  So, we're trying to think of anything we could do.  And a bunch of our listeners are, like, coming up and saying hi.  And we're like, we could hit them up for 20.  Wait a minute.  We were going to hit you guys up for cash last night. 
[00:36:00]  We're like, hey, man, I don't know.  Ask a listener.  It's like, people seem to want to hang out and check out the show.  Why don't we sell Spocks?  And I start...  Because there was no ATMs around.  We were desperate.  I start laughing my ass off because all the papers when we signed our deal is like,  Opie and Anthony just signed a lucrative $30 million contract.  I can't afford a beer.  Right.  Yeah, sure.  $30 million.  I can't afford a beer.  And here we are.  We're going to hit up our own listeners for cash so we can have some beer.  Oh, we... 
[00:36:30]  But we stink.  We stink is what I was saying.  So, Ben finally got a line on where a cash machine was.  Right.  So, I'm like, all right, I'm up for it.  I'll go and grab some money so we can drink.  So, I go downstairs to the downstairs bar again.  And by this point, DMX is down there.  Smoke weed every day.  He's down there with a bunch of other rap dudes.  And...  It was the bad boy, Posse.  I don't know their names.  I got halfway down the stairs and hit a fog bank of pot smoke. 
[00:37:00]  It was...  The whole bar was smoked out.  And, you know, usually when you smell that, you're like, where's that coming from?  I mean, you kind of got to see where someone might have it under a table and he's waving  his hand to get the smoke down.  No.  These guys are all smoking the biggest, fattest joint right in the middle of the bar.  Right at the bar.  Just passing it around.  Yo, man, I'll tell you, that was great.  Yo, give me that, man.  Right in front.  Give me a gin.  Bang-a-ray. 
[00:37:30]  Smoking pot.  And no one cares.  If you looked real fast, you would think, oh, well, look, they're smoking cigars celebrating  the Vietnam.  Smoking cigars.  Yeah, that's what they're most like.  They were the biggest cigars.  And these...  I'm sorry.  It looked to me as underage little white kids are hanging out with them.  Like, it looked like they just muscled themselves in.  That was Sum 41.  Oh, it was Sum 41.  No, no, no, no, no.  I know Ant's talking about those other guys.  Yeah, they were like young kids.  Not Sum 41 with the spiked hair.  No, no.  It was like young kids.  Right.  Walked over and was like, let me hit that. 
[00:38:00]  And they're passing it.  You know, I don't smoke weed, and I haven't in a long time, but I was so tempted to just  go over, man, let me hit that.  Just so I could say I partied with those guys, you know?  I got enough of a buzz walking down the stairs.  And then Sum 41, that was funny.  I didn't know if they were old, and I'm like, you guys need us to buy your beers?  They look like they're 12.  I know.  And Sum 41.  Hey, Keith.  Keith the cop.  We lose him? 
[00:38:30]  He wanted to add to this.  Hello, Keith.  Keith, Keith, Keith, Keith, Keith.  Keith.  I think he hung up.  All right, he'll call back.  Very busy.  He was our security last night.  Yeah.  Don Johnson.  Oh, and then we ran into Alien Ant Farm at the, well, one of the guys from Alien Ant Farm  at the bar.  Yeah.  And they were explaining how that Smooth Criminal song got together.  Yeah.  You were saying it was just a goof that they would just play the riff during their show 
[00:39:00]  as a goof.  And all of a sudden, people started coming up to him and going, hey, play that Michael  Jackson song.  And the singer had to go out and learn the words, and the rest of them had to learn the  rest of the song.  And they totally were not expecting it to be a hit.  It was just a goof to them.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  That is so cool.  And then more beer.  One of our new friends on the line.  Hello?  DJ White Owl.  What's up, buddy?  Turn that down.  Hey, I was going to tell you guys that I love you, and every day is Whip'em Out Wednesdays  for me.  Right.  What's going on, O.P. and Anthony? 
[00:39:30]  One of the guys from Bad Ronald.  How are you guys doing?  This is right on from Bad Ronald.  I just want to say that Greenberg and my friends Mark, Jamie, Bill, Ian, Doug, Ray,  and we love you guys every day with Whip'em Out.  Right on.  And you guys are coming on the show next week, right?  We're coming on the show on September.  And afterwards, we're going down to the Hard Times Awards to perform at the Wetlands.  And we love you guys.  We can't wait to join you.  Hey, are you guys going to play a couple songs for us?  We're going to play whatever you guys want us to play.  Well, you guys made that special wow song for us. 
[00:40:00]  We'd love to hear that live.  We're going to do that wow song live.  We love you guys, man.  All right.  What do you want in the studio?  You guys need anything?  You need balls?  We need Red Bulls and a whole bunch of natural pharmaceutical growth, if you know what I'm  talking about, baby.  All right.  We'll figure out what we can do for you, all right?  Hope you're going to love you guys.  It's so stinky.  These guys got a lot of fun.  It's so stinky.  We love you.  Yeah, Ben and Stinky were hanging out with these guys.  Not last night, but earlier this week.  A couple nights ago, Stinky, they like to smoke a lot of weed. 
[00:40:30]  Stinky likes to smoke a lot of weed.  It was like a match made in heaven.  Right on.  We got the song by Bad Arnold?  All right.  Why don't we play?  Ronald.  Sorry.  I say that all the time.  What?  Oh, Keith's going back, too?  Keith.  Hey, Keith.  What's going on?  What's up, man?  First of all, I want to say, you know, I didn't mean to rip off Big Kev with the whole  security thing.  But, you know, I love the guy, so, you know.  He's here, by the way.  You're dead.  So what do you have to add to our night last night? 
[00:41:00]  We're just getting started here.  That's true.  We are just getting started.  We didn't even get into the backstage thing when we were looking ahead backstage with  Rick when he first went in.  Yeah, we went backstage.  Yeah.  Rick supposedly got right on the stage or something.  Yeah, I got right on the stage.  It's just all about BS and not stopping.  Right.  As long as you want.  Like, I didn't even have a ticket to go in last night.  Oh, yeah.  But as we were walking in.  Your ticket was your badge.  I just, you know, walk in and just say, hey, how you doing?  I'm with Opie and Anthony, security, blah, blah, blah, and just keep walking. 
[00:41:30]  And no one says it.  As long as you keep walking and you don't stop.  Right.  Right.  You're golden.  And that was the same thing.  We were going backstage.  And Rick went, like, oh, my God, we've got to get back there.  Lead with your balls.  And that's it.  I said, all right, come on, we're going.  And I just started walking with Opie and I just started talking.  Yeah.  I mean, Kid Rock backstage, blah, blah, blah, and the lady just looked and just keep walking.  It was cool.  We talked to everybody last night.  Yeah.  And the money thing was a pathetic thing.  That's what I was calling it.  We had to hit you up for cash.  We're, like, all pulling out, like, crumpled up $1 bills and stuff.  And all the homies, man, you see what they were carrying around? 
[00:42:00]  Dude, they were tipping with 20s.  Yeah.  Fat Boy Slim had a cookie and tips the bartender $20.  And we're, like, digging up bar cabbage out of our pockets.  I remember one round came to $26, and I had a $20 and a $5 in my hand.  I was, like, oh, no.  I had to pull dollars out of my car.  I know.  Like, oh, God, I'm a buck short, and I haven't even tipped a guy.  It was bad.  It was so bad.  Sad.  All right, Keith, call up if anything else comes to mind, all right?  You got it. 
[00:42:30]  I'll talk to you later.  All right.  What about when we ran into Carson after the old U2 debacle, and we're talking to him,  and Anthony's like, so what the F happened with the U2 thing?  Yeah, he kind of had a hard time with that one.  Turns out he's a fan of the show, too.  Yeah, who knew?  We still got a goof on you, though, Carson.  Come on.  All right.  We are finally ready to play the clips.  Very good.  From the retarded Laverne and Shirley, because we were just getting started when we got off  the air yesterday.  Yeah.  From 7 to 8, we taped a whole bunch of stuff.  It's all new stuff. 
[00:43:00]  Retarded Laverne and Shirley from yesterday having interactions with everybody that you saw on  the MTV Video Music Awards last night, and we will start that next, okay?  And John Valby outside.  We've got to get him in here.  He's playing, what, Governors tonight?  Governors tonight, yeah.  What time?  Two shows?  8 o'clock start.  I think he does.  He's doing two, yeah.  Yeah, two shows with John Valby.  Unbelievably funny, and there's a few tickets available.  He's playing Governors tonight in Levittown.  He's going to play a few songs for us in the background, okay?  Cool.  As we go to break, our new friends, Bad Ronald, they're coming in next week, Anthony. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  They're going to perform their latest song and this little rap song they did for us next  week.  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Woo!  Put them on the glass.  Put out your pants.  Let me see your ass.  Wednesdays.  Got me feeling dopey.  Big breasts.  With Anthony and Opie.  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow! 
[00:44:00]  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Hey, ladies, please give me a chance.  Fifty dollars just to watch you dance.  Holy smokes, are those things real?  Come over here so I can grab a feel.  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Okay, boys, here they come.  Oh, wow, I don't even know what to say. 
[00:44:30]  All I know is today is Wednesday.  You look delicious everywhere you go.  Even though you're rocking a camel toe.  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays!  Wow!  Whip them out Wednesdays! 
[00:45:00]  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW.  Lincoln Park rocked last night.  A little taste of crawling.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey!  There's so much going on.  We've got to play the clips from the retarded Laverna Shirley.  Who's that?  What's her name?  She's like a new artist. 
[00:45:30]  Who's that?  Did Ben know?  Our pictures are up from the VMAs yesterday.  You can finally see what the retarded Laverna Shirley looked like.  It was from the red carpet.  What picture number is it?  That's picture number 20.  Someone help us out.  Who is that?  She's really hot.  It's not only good.  Huh?  What?  They kept like...  It's Aaliyah.  No, it's not Aaliyah. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, my God.  Does Stinky know?  Who's this?  We have no clue.  We have no clue.  Someone will help us out with that, Anthony.  Stinky, you like the pot, right?  You like the pot.  Sure.  You know what the brothers call it when the room gets all smoky?  Smoke out?  No.  They go, hey, man, it's getting a little cloudy in here.  That's a nice one.  It's getting a little cloudy in here.  I learned that last night.  You're down? 
[00:46:30]  I'm down now.  Sure.  I think they were saying that last night because we were crowding their space.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the white boys doing in our space?  It's getting a little cloudy in here.  Maybe that is what it meant.  Uh-oh.  Well, clouds are white.  I'm going through some of the pictures.  We should tell people, we had to put the pictures up on WNAW.com, okay?  Yeah.  Go to WNAW.com.  We got about 60 pictures from last night's show.  Yeah, so I'm Kelly Ripa. 
[00:47:00]  There she is.  She was wearing an Italian Stuart Better shirt.  Yeah.  That girl is wild, man.  She is so hot in person.  She just had a kid, and she's smoking.  Big time smoking.  So go to WNAW.com.  Check out the pictures.  You'll see a lot of Laverne and Shirley, retard Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah, those pictures are disturbing.  And picture photo 37, a great picture of Mick Jagger.  And it's like right...  Did you see this one yet?  Yeah, I did see that.  That was how close he was.  He was that close, and he's turning his head because he finally realized what he was heading toward. 
[00:47:30]  He went past a lot of the press, and then all of a sudden he almost came over.  Like he started walking over, and then stupid Marion's just like,  And he looked and was just like,  And like ran away.  We were all so bummed.  Because we were all just keeping our fingers crossed.  Oh my God, Mick Jagger's coming over.  Well, the thing was, too, all the idiots and reporters before us didn't know what to ask him.  He's got a huge new album coming out.  So I started saying stuff about the new album, and he came over and took one look at those two mutants. 
[00:48:00]  And ran.  And we have it on tape somewhere.  And we went,  Nick, what's going on?  Hey.  What's up?  You there?  That wasn't Alicia Keys, Keith.  Picture 20 is not Alicia Keys.  Nick, what's up?  We lost Nick, I guess.  That's okay.  We should also mention that Ben knew where all the parties were last night.  Yeah.  I don't know how he does it.  He gets on his little phone, and then magic happens.  He knew, Mario Cantone, hold on. 
[00:48:30]  Wow, this is going to be a party today.  I saw them, too.  Have you watched?  I was at the party last night.  Which one?  Oh, the big one.  I was at the party last night.  Yeah, that's the one you say.  You know, the big one.  The big one.  Well, there was a wrap party for Sex and the City at Park last night on 10th Avenue.  And then they tried to kick everybody out at 1130.  They were like, okay, the MTV party's coming to get out.  Like, we're going to get out?  Right.  We're from Sex and the City.  So me and my lovely friend Kim Cattrall and Darren Starr and all these people, we all  went upstairs, and they let us in. 
[00:49:00]  But they wouldn't let some people in.  Really?  They wouldn't let the executive producer, Michael Patrick King, who was the brain and the  creative force behind that show.  They pissed me off.  That hurts.  I pissed.  It was like, please.  It was ridiculous.  So since they didn't let him in.  They did that to me in Sag Harbor.  I just did a big benefit with Alec Baldwin.  They wanted $45.  And I turned around and walked away.  And they came back to the hotel.  Oh, we can get you in.  I was like, I don't care.  I'm taking you personally.  I'm staying home and watching myself on A.J. Benza. 
[00:49:30]  So, which I canceled.  So, anyway, I went upstairs.  And, yeah, we went upstairs.  We were at the party.  Mario.  What?  Sorry, but we just got a great view.  Of course.  Oh, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls.  Kimmy.  Oh, my God.  Why must I compete?  Look at it.  Now that Kimmy's not.  Kimmy.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Kimmy from Survivor.  I want to play Twister.  Now that she's not as famous, she's now flashing no problem.  You notice that, Anthony?  Kimmy's massaging me.  Kimmy from Survivor. 
[00:50:00]  Kimmy.  Oh, Kimmy.  She's from Survivor, reality TV.  Never watched the stuff.  How you been, Kimmy?  Survivor 2, Australia.  Survivor 2.  She wouldn't eat the meat.  Honey, I don't care.  She wouldn't eat the meat.  Well, that's what...  The occasional tube steak is acceptable.  Oh.  Kimmy, you're very curcuvicious.  How weird is it that Kimmy won't eat the meat, but Mario will?  Oh, of course I will.  Get your balls out.  Kimmy will eat the meat.  That mouse could fart.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Look at your mouth. 
[00:50:30]  That's huge.  I know the mouth's huge.  That mouse is what...  Please, it's as wide as Minnie Mouse is.  It's Minnie Mouse's heel.  Isn't that good though?  Yeah, it is.  So we know you'll eat the meat.  Wow.  Get your tube steak.  Take a chop now.  Hey, we could have a little reality TV war today, because we got Mike from Real World  New York outside, too.  Oh, really?  Is he...  I just went right back to buy him.  Yeah, and that's John Valby, who has to leave in like 10 minutes.  John, I...  John. 
[00:51:00]  Where are you going, Johnny?  Long Island.  No, Johnny, come back.  I knew I'd wait for you.  John, you know John Valby, Mario?  No, hi, John.  Dr. Durie, you never heard of Dr. Durie?  I'm bad.  I don't know anything.  He's playing governance tonight on Long Island.  You're so terrific.  I love Dr. Durie.  And I'm a dirty girl.  You are.  You should have.  Can we see your boobs again?  Yeah, you didn't give us a good flashing through the window.  We got the prison visit.  Is she really showing us her breasts? 
[00:51:30]  Wow, yeah.  I just saw her breasts.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Boobs!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, I can't say that word.  Yeah, they get a little...  They get a little...  I'm sorry.  Tell me, because I don't know the new rules.  There are these descriptive things.  All right, tell me.  Marion, we are responsible broadcasters, even though 2020 Downtown doesn't think so.  I apologize.  It's me.  It's not them.  I have the potty mind.  We got to get a couple songs out of John Valby before he has to leave.  He's leaving.  Sing something.  Do you know New York, New York?  Oh, I don't know.  Do you know when the world goes round? 
[00:52:00]  How about...  Cabaret!  When you're alone and life is making you horny, you can always go to the bathroom.  When the Calvin Klein ads start to get to your nads.  Well, you can always go to the bathroom.  You can let the water run so mom can't hear you whacking.  Get your sister's underwear and hold the sweaty crack in front of your face. 
[00:52:30]  The odor's much stronger there.  And if you get lucky, you might find a hair in the bathroom.  Your hand is waiting for you.  Oh, yeah.  That's a terrific song.  I'd like to sing that at Carnegie Hall.  Can I use it?  I like when it gets weird in here.  You guys are like from total ends of the spectrum. 
[00:53:00]  Did that song make the radio wreck?  That made the radio?  Hell, yeah.  Yeah, that was nothing bad there.  I planned that one.  I could tell.  Listen, let me do this one little football limerick.  You know, I'm ready for football.  We can't wait for football.  The Giants quarterback is a Collins thing.  Don Carey, who's getting ready to pop the season's NFL cherry.  But he's starting to get tense because the Giants defense breaks down more than Mariah Carey. 
[00:53:30]  Your mother has a...  John, in the pocket, please, musically.  In the pocket.  Wait a minute, John.  You're doing so well there.  Oh, you can't say the B-J thing.  Yeah, they get upset with that.  Yeah, yeah.  That is funny.  You can say, I blew my candles out.  Right.  Right.  But you can't say the anything.  No, no.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  John, that made it, though.  That was a little rough.  That's the first part.  Very funny.  I like the Mariah Carey thing.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Another breakdown.  She was all ready to do the interview.  Oh, please.  And then she ended up back in the hospital.  No, she ended up, she's back in the loony ward again.  Let me tell you something.  First of all, another breakdown?  You see, the thing with her is she's finding out slowly that as a live performer, there's  nothing there.  There's nothing emotional or there's no connection to the music.  And she saw a screening of Glitter, which led to her second breakdown. 
[00:54:30]  That's what really happened.  That movie's made.  Aliens.  Can't she really sing on key, though?  I thought she could really sing.  She's a good studio singer.  But live, it doesn't work.  So what's the difference if she can feel it?  She doesn't have to feel it.  Yeah, sure, because you've got to be able to do it live.  That's the proof in the pudding.  Well, Al.  That's the proof in the pudding.  I agree with the performing live, but, gee, she doesn't have to feel it every night.  She sold her soul to the devil for a career, and I think it's all coming down on her now.  And you know what?  She's not a talented performer.  She's a good singer.  You don't think so?  No.  She's no Whitney Houston, and I know you guys make fun of her. 
[00:55:00]  I love her.  I'm telling you, Whitney Houston on her worst day is better than her.  I love the Whitney Houston.  I do.  But Mariah Carey, you know, and she's got another movie coming out on the heels of glitter,  which supposedly is abominable.  I mean, where does she think she can act?  Where?  You know what drove her to a breakdown is Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, other young singers 
[00:55:30]  coming in, making her seem old, and her record, her album didn't sell well.  But it did fine.  It's not because it didn't debut number one.  What kind of an ass are you?  Did you have to have a breakdown over that and break plates in your mother's kitchen?  That must have looked great.  Oh, my God.  I'm taking this wedge wood and smashing it over your head, mother.  Like life is that tough.  Like life is that tough.  I would love to have her life.  No kidding.  Well, you know.  I bet she could afford a beer.  I would love to have her boobs.  I would never leave the house. 
[00:56:00]  You wouldn't.  And you know what?  You'd be a he-sheet.  I have problems.  Wait.  Can I just talk about this party last night?  It was pretty interesting.  Were you at this party?  We don't get invited.  Oh, guys.  You are big, big, big.  You should be there.  I wasn't invited.  I snuck upstairs.  You knew the password.  Yes.  Sex in the city.  He was the password.  Ben knew all the passwords to get into the party.  What was the password, Ben, to the one?  Well, we went to the Hudson Hotel.  Oh.  And we were having... 
[00:56:30]  P. Diddy's party was up there.  P. Diddy's party was up there.  P. Diddy's party.  On the 24th floor.  On the 24th floor.  We're on the ground level.  We can't even...  We're eating burgers.  We're eating burgers with, like, tourists.  I love being with the real people on the radio.  Wait, wait.  What was the password for that one party?  Liam Gallagher was one of the ones...  Liam Gallagher.  ...get through to one guy...  And that was to get into...  No.  That was the Interscope party.  Liam Gallagher.  That was a password.  Funny that they picked a lovely Irish name.  P. Diddy is a British name.  I have to pee, Diddy.  Hey. 
[00:57:00]  Diddy, I have to pee.  So what party did you go to?  It was at Park.  It was a very lovely place on, like, 17th and wherever, 10th.  And the Sex in the City party was there.  They tried to kick everybody out.  And we snuck upstairs.  And me and Kim Cattrall were up there having a great time.  And Kim took a picture with the lovely Snoop Doggy dog.  Really?  Oh, look at that.  Was that where he was hiding?  Yes.  From Shook Knight.  And who's the blonde girl?  Gwen Stefani?  Yes.  She was there.  Yeah.  Oh, and you two was there, too.  Really?  Yeah, you two was there.  And you're at this goddamn party. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, but I didn't meet you two.  They were, like, in the corner.  And Kim's going like this.  They were like, Bono's here.  Kim's like, Stunny Bono's here.  I'm like, he's dead.  He dies in a sea accident.  But I said, no, it's Mary Bono.  And she brought the rest of the Republicans with her.  But we didn't meet them.  But I met Carson Daly.  They did.  We talked to Carson.  It's very interesting.  He's not a bad guy.  He's a very nice guy.  He's very nice.  And I...  He can read a cue card.  Yes.  Like nobody. 
[00:58:00]  And he wears a suede leather coat.  We were at the VMAs.  Anthony had the whole audience...  You went to the audience?  You went to...  You were in the audience?  Oh, we just told all...  We had some great stories.  But one of them, where in our section, Anthony, you've got to relay that story, when Carson  was reading the cue cards.  Carson's reading the cue cards about bringing you two out.  And I screamed out, uh...  I go, yeah, read it, Carson.  Read it.  And like the whole section...  They stopped laughing.  Like...  We were just like the people that weren't supposed to be there, people, for the whole night. 
[00:58:30]  We're dressed like slobs.  Everyone's walking around in their Armani's and stuff.  And we're just like...  Like I said, Opie looked like he was an extra from the original MASH movie.  Yeah, we have the clothes on that we had yesterday.  He didn't change from the VMA Awards?  That sounds like a disease, he's got VMA.  VMA.  It's very weird.  John's got to get out of here in like five minutes.  Oh, Johnny.  Yeah, he's going to play Governor's tonight in Levittown on Long Island.  Two shows.  Governor's Levittown.  You've got to go. 
[00:59:00]  Great time.  It's a party.  John, I will not be making it tonight, because I'm dead to the worst.  The world's got to go home.  Yeah.  I understand.  I would love to be here.  We'll party without you.  Okay.  You got another ditty for us?  Well, you know, you told me the new rules of the radio.  I don't want to get in trouble here.  Yeah.  Let me see.  They say that Viagra from Pfizer...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't say that?  No.  Only in terms of name.  Like if they did came over and...  Limp junk?  Right. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, you are.  They say that Viagra from Pfizer can turn a limp junk into a geyser.  But when I want my block as hard as a rock, I just chug down a couple Budweiser.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your grandma ran over her nipple with her wheelchair.  I like that one. 
[01:00:00]  I don't care if that one made the radio.  Did that make the radio?  I hope so.  Oh, sure.  Oh, don't.  They dumped out of something there, John.  Mario can't even look at you.  You can't say nipple anymore?  Yeah, you can.  You just can't use it in any context whatsoever.  How many times they do it?  I don't like these new rules.  I don't either.  I think I'm going to have to talk to the boss.  Just get him on the phone.  What's his name?  Just get on your knees.  No, I will not.  You get on your knees, Kimmy.  Don't mess with me because I will beat you up right here, survivor. 
[01:00:30]  You won't be surviving my tongue.  Take down that bitch of a bearing one.  And put a bay window where it ought to be.  We just do Joe Coven.  I want to do Joe Coven calling your boss.  What's his name, your boss?  Ken Stevens.  One of my gay friends.  Hello.  I'd like to speak to Ken.  Stevens.  Ken Stevens.  I'd like to speak to Ken Stevens.  Get Stevens on the line.  Hey, Ken.  Stevens. 
[01:01:00]  Ken Stevens.  Mr. Stevens, this is Miss Crawford.  I don't like your new rules.  I think it's terrible that you can't say the seven words that George Carlin used to say.  It's 2001.  It's not 1948 when I made Mildred Pierce.  Sure, why not?  Well, all right.  Go home.  Call your wife and call me later.  Click.  I'm not sure which head I'm going to pound off the bed board later. 
[01:01:30]  Hey, John, how about one more before we take a break?  Come on, John.  Take a break.  We just have to be kinder and have cabaret.  Let me do this.  Let me do this.  Over here.  Off the road again.  My M and board trip off the road again.  Half my family flew out coming round the bend.  Thanks to Firestone, I'm off the road again.  What did they dump out of there? 
[01:02:00]  They didn't dump on that song.  Not that one.  No.  It had to be a dump from there.  It had to be a dump from a board.  It couldn't be one of my lovely dumps.  Probably when you said Pierce the B.  I pulled her pants right down, and what did I get?  With a cake cod and some underwear sweat.  My knees started buckling, bladder lost control.  But my junk stood up like a telephone pole. 
[01:02:30]  I like that's what I got.  I better stop right there.  You're terrific.  He's so terrific.  Knock, knock.  Who's there?  Athena.  Athena who?  Athena couple faggots at the game.  Take offense to that, John.  Get out.  Take your piano, your keyboard, shove it up your ass, and get out.  They're going to dump out of that, too. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, they should dump out of the word fag before they dump out of the word ass.  Get your balls up.  On mine, John.  That won't work.  They'll be playing tonsil hockey.  Don't you know some Gershwin?  Gershwin.  I don't even know what's making the radio.  I got music.  All right.  All right.  John Valby, tonight at Governor's Levittown. 
[01:03:30]  Can I get a prediction, Super Bowl winner, from you guys before the season starts?  I'm going to go with Baltimore, just so you know.  I'm sticking with the champion.  They're a champion for a reason.  Well, you're a Bills fan.  No, no.  I'm from Buffalo, and I'm a Cowboy fan.  Cowboy.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  Inbreeding.  You're from Buffalo, and you root for the Cowboys?  Yeah, but I grew up in Rochester.  You should be shot.  Buffalo wasn't in the league.  Remember, I'm an old-timer, so Buffalo wasn't even in the league back then.  So I picked a team before Buffalo was there. 
[01:04:00]  Star in a helmet, I was a little kid, and they had Eddie LeBaron, the shortest quarterback  in the league.  Man, that was my team.  The underdog.  Hey, Mario, who's your team?  I think the Boston Bruins.  They're going to win the Super Bowl.  I was thinking the Packers.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Okay, you big crackin' breeder.  I'll kick your ass.  I'm calling your girlfriend.  He's into the Bruins because they're good stick handlers. 
[01:04:30]  I believe the straight boys handle the sticks, too.  All right?  Ding, ding, ding.  No, who is...  See, I don't know anything about football.  Like, I care.  My family, they're a bunch of compulsive gamblers.  I bet on football.  You think I'm going to be into football?  Oh, really?  Yes.  Compulsive gambling sucks, but actually watching the game is great.  You don't bet on games?  Oh, absolutely not.  Well, good.  I bet a beer with my buddy or something.  Yeah, that's good.  When they come around with those slips.  You're a good old boy.  Fill it out.  It's easy.  You're a good old boy. 
[01:05:00]  Fill it out.  It's easy.  You win.  You just pick 20 teams.  The Packers.  You're a bad.  Yeah, I love the Packers.  That was way too easy.  Are they the Fudge Packers or the Party Packers?  No, that was good.  I like a Party Packer.  I'll have to wait until the season starts.  Oh, my God.  Be one of those people that jump on board the winning team.  The bandwagon guy.  Yeah.  So, I hope you.  That's all.  I didn't hear you.  I'll jump the winning team.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, well, Kimmy, I've heard a few things.  I'm not going to say, don't say anything.  Kimmy, you're lovely, but you could pull a tractor with that mouth.  I've got no complaint.  You've got a lovely large mouth.  Thank you.  Wow.  Kiss me.  Kimmy.  Wow.  Look at how big that mouth gets.  Jesus.  I'm sure there's a football player that would love that.  See, you can shut me up.  Oh.  What?  Oh, my.  No, last time we had you on the air, you admitted to some kind of a liaison with a football 
[01:06:00]  player that shall remain nameless.  We know who it is.  Can you sign it?  Oh, can I tell you something?  Remember how we were talking about Kevin James?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I ran into him twice since then.  Front door and back door.  Another guy you banged.  She banged Kevin James.  Kevin James.  The king of kings.  Did you?  Back in high school.  They went to high school together.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Did Papa Chubby when he died?  He's ten years older than me. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We went to the same high school.  Oh, it was at a bar after it.  Yeah.  Does he know that you banged him?  I let him be aware of it.  I said, by the way, I'm the girl that you effed.  Well, at least you did it before.  He looked at me.  He had to actually look up at me.  He's shorter than me.  He didn't remember?  How did he forget that mouth?  You remember that.  I think he had a beer on top of my head.  Oh, the dream girl.  Oh, that's great, man.  Throw an ambulance. 
[01:07:00]  Take me out of here.  He didn't look at your face.  He was playing cards on your back with a friend.  Exactly.  Hey, John, do you have one more before you go, or are you spent?  I'm not spent.  I just don't know what I can get out.  I know.  What you really got to do is go to the shows tonight at Governor's in Leavittown.  Can I do it to hear the underwear and stuff?  Can I do that?  No.  You can't even say I'm...  No, no.  You can't say I'm because it describes it.  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  There you go.  See?  Oh, this is like a South Park episode.  It is.  It's ridiculous.  I got one without any dirty words, but it's kind of a real low-life one.  You want to do it?  Perfect.  I think I have.  And the others aren't?  I once picked up a Manhattan geek whose financial condition was obviously bleak.  After swallowing my goo, she said, 
[01:08:00]  Mmm, thank you.  That's the first hot meal I've had.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your mother played dead until the dog was done.  Speaking of dog, I think they dumped that one, too.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Wow.  That was a lovely song about a cafeteria lady.  That had absolutely no dirty words in it.  No.  Well, we're checking to see if they dumped that. 
[01:08:30]  I don't think so.  Do they censor intellectual content?  Rick, do they dump that?  Well, tough to tell, only because the machines have been working overtime,  so I don't know who's building up and what we're talking about.  It sounds like we're in a fishbowl.  I have to really watch my mouth from now on on the show.  I just will have to shift.  All right.  I will.  I'm just not used to it.  John, it's always a pleasure.  Hey, thanks.  Good to see you guys.  Check him out at Governor's tonight for two shows.  Yeah, Levittown.  In Levittown.  Very cool. 
[01:09:00]  Have a great show.  Try to leave the word fag out of it.  Good night, Joe.  He's old school.  He sure is.  He's a good old school boy.  That's old school.  He's a good old boy school.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  All right.  All right.  The listeners are going to kill us if we don't play the clips from the retarded Laverne Shirley  from yesterday.  Yes.  We were on the red carpet yesterday, Mario, and we did a whole show from there, and things  started heating up as we had to go off the air yesterday, but we taped from 7 to 8 
[01:09:30]  last night, and we got some priceless clips of celebrities.  Awesome.  See?  Look at how close we are to the red carpet.  See?  Oh, my.  Look at you.  Who's that?  They're right.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Some big, scary black guy.  I don't know who it was.  It's part of P. Diddy, the posse.  I just like the P. Diddy.  I love saying that word.  P. Diddy.  There are people like P. Diddy and J. Lo and Janet Jackson that have the hugest entourages.  They just like ... They walk ... A bunch of people walk by, then you see them, and then  a bunch more people walk by. 
[01:10:00]  I wouldn't want to travel with all that luggage.  Yeah.  I mean, we're just ... Well ... We have to talk about Anne Hayes later, too.  I got a list.  I'm going to ... Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Other things, we got to talk about Michael Jackson.  I'm going to see him Monday night.  Liza Minnelli's singing with him.  I got a lot to talk about.  Let's get to it.  Take a break.  All right.  We'll take a break, and we'll definitely start playing the clips.  They're going to kill us, Anne.  I'm telling you.  We'll definitely do this.  I'm telling you.  Also, the pictures are up on WNEW.com from yesterday's show.  When's Caratop doing a Maybelline commercial?  Oh, God. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  We'll get into it.  Don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come here for the news.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I like it when this show's dirty.  Anthony Pinnacle, Horny Goatweed.  Wow.  I'm looking at Kimmy's pictures in Edge Magazine.  And you won't need Horny Goatweed looking at these.  Look at this slutty, grainy picture that just looks like you were just effed.  You have a fresh, like, effed look. 
[01:11:00]  She looks good, though.  Isn't that good?  Yeah, she looks beautiful.  Pinnacle, Horny Goatweed.  She looks slutty.  Yeah, like a slut.  Oh, and I used the Horny Goatweed and the monkey around, and oh, my God.  Really?  You know what, Kimmy?  Oh, my God.  Kimmy, you are.  You're a tramp.  A tramp.  A little bit of a bath.

[01:12:00]  And we're back with the O&A show.  Mario Cantone in the studio.  He's playing Carolines in New York, Sunday night at 8 o'clock.  A bunch of us are going to that show, Mario.  I'm so thrilled you're coming.  I promised you that.  Hey, are you into the Sum 41?  Oh, I love the Sum 42.  Is that them?  How about me?  I'm so bad with the white boy groups, I'm sorry.  Really?  Yeah.  Except for the Coldplay.  Yeah, you like the Coldplay. 
[01:12:30]  This is Fat Lip from Sum 41.  You like the Fat Lip?  I love the Fat Lip.  Kimmy has Fat Lip.  Kimmy's got the Fat Lips.  She has beautiful Fat Lips.  Kimmy, you look really horny.  Are you all right?  When was the last time you had some of that?  You know what?  Because the season just ended, so now I'm ready.  What, the F season?  No, the period season.  Oh.  The pleading season just ended, so I'm ready.  The time of the month?  You're ready to go.  I'm ready.  What kind of birth control are you using? 
[01:13:00]  You take the pill?  I can try cycling just like every other girl.  Yeah, you take the pill?  Yes, I do.  Good.  Do you have a long-term boyfriend, or do you just kind of play the field?  I'm dating.  You're dating?  I'm dating.  Do you consider yourself a sexually compulsive woman, or do you?  Oh.  That's a interesting term.  She's a nympho, man.  Look at her.  You like sex.  I definitely do.  Well, I'm glad you like it, and I'm glad you admit it.  Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  As a woman, I do not deny.  She wanted to keep her virginity until she was 14, so she practiced.  No, no, no.  She wanted to keep her virginity.  Well, explain, using the proper terminology. 
[01:13:30]  Well, this is what happened.  While all the other girls were beginning their sexual experiences having sex, I decided to  put it off.  So instead, I just opened it up and said, ah.  Right.  Oh, you mean.  She would give it that way instead of having sex.  I was orally enhancing, and it turns out that that increased my property value.  You know, we have to bring this up.  When Rolling Stone interviewed us, the guy from Rolling Stone, we were talking about our 
[01:14:00]  Boston days, right?  Yeah.  And he goes, Boston is a hilarious city when it comes to women and sex.  There's a lot of women that go to the colleges in Boston, and they want to remain virgins.  But they will give up the balloon knot.  The back door.  The back door.  This guy, the guy from Rolling Stone swears by this.  Because they're still virgins.  Can I ask you when this article is coming out, this article?  We were in the hot issue that was out a couple weeks ago.  It's fabulous.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  That's great. 
[01:14:30]  We're just a little blur.  It's not even worth it.  Let me tell you something.  It's only going to escalate for you, so get ready.  We found that funny that the girls, you know, they want to be virgins while they're in college,  but they'll give up the back door.  So they can say that they're virgins still.  Oh, boy.  The guy swears by this.  We're like, come on, you're pulling our leg.  Well, you know, for a gay guy, that's breaking the cherry.  So, you know, she's maybe a virgin in the front, but not on the back.  Knock, knock, knock.  You have yourself a bunch of front doors shut tight. 
[01:15:00]  That would make it easier, I think, for the girl, because usually they go, oh, you know,  I heard it hurts the first time.  But after giving up the back first, it's like, hey, geez, this is like nothing, right?  It belongs here.  Let's go to a clip.  Yeah, let's play some of these clips.  Come on, I want to hear some of these clips.  The set-up, Anthony, really fast.  Went to the VMAs last night, Video Music Awards, MTV.  I was at the party.  The big one.  Yeah, lucky you.  I snuck in.  We didn't want to do the interviews ourselves because, quite frankly, getting blown off by 
[01:15:30]  these people by the red carpet would be very embarrassing.  Because they blew off everybody.  Yeah.  So, who did your interviews?  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Marion and Lady Di.  Show them a picture of the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Did they dress that?  We wanted them to, but they didn't.  The pictures are up on opieandanthony.com.  Yeah, wait until you get a load of these two.  There's Marion.  No, I'm not with these people.  There's Marion and there's Lady Di.  And they did the interviews for us. 
[01:16:00]  There's another little picture.  They look very drunk.  And they're not shy.  They look like the very, you know, suburban, short haircut, hockey mom kind of butch, dykey  kind of thing.  But even though, obviously, they're just suburban housewives.  No, they're like yin-yang people or something.  They're yin-yang party, yeah.  Yin-yang party.  That's their saying, yin-yang party.  How about that perm on Marion?  She looks good, though.  Everyone was commenting on her perm.  She's a delight.  So now, they obviously... 
[01:16:30]  You die today.  I'm going to jump over and strangle you.  All right, come on.  Let's get to the clips.  All right.  They obviously have no experience at doing interviews.  And not only that, it's not just like taking normal people with no experience.  They are completely retarded.  Right.  They can't put together a thought.  They can't shut up.  They just babble and babble.  Right.  And they don't know what they're talking about.  They are retarded.  And, yeah, the action started heating up after we got off the air at 7.  And so, this is what we taped after the show yesterday. 
[01:17:00]  It starts with Alicia Keys.  She was...  I saw her open for Maxwell.  She was phenomenal.  She's so talented.  Oh, yeah?  And she's an incredible live performer.  It's much better than a CD.  Well...  She's really talented, this girl.  Well, we have an 18-second interview with Alicia Keys.  Let's hear it.  Okay.  I love her.  I love her.  Here's...  Hey, Alicia Keys.  How you doing?  Alicia Keys.  How you doing?  Come here.  I want to ask a couple questions.  They do a double or sometimes triple take, looking back at them. 
[01:17:30]  That's all we got.  We didn't really ask her from her.  You didn't hear anything with her.  Well, we didn't have success with Alicia Keys.  That's because somebody called her Missy Elliott first.  How do you confuse those two?  No way.  No, no.  Missy Elliott wasn't going by just then.  I was surprised they were going,  Elia, you're back.  I mean, you're terrible.  Oh, that's terrible.  They might have came out a little strong and scared off Alicia Keys.  Oh, you'll notice they scare off quite a few people.  So, all right, the next person that came down the red carpet is Little Moe. 
[01:18:00]  You know the Little Moe?  Little Moe.  You know, I have to say something.  Some of these rappers have some...  I think they're very kind of gay names, like Nelly.  Does he realize?  Fabulous.  Hello.  Fabulous.  Come on.  Fabulous.  Putting the word ghetto before it doesn't make a difference.  Fabulous.  And then Little Moe, I was called that many times in junior high school.  Oh, my God.  Well, here's the retarded Laverne Shirley with their 25-second interaction with Little Moe.  Okay, Little Moe. 
[01:18:30]  Little Moe.  Hi, how are you?  I'm Mary.  That's Diane from the opening entry show.  Hey, that's a nice outfit.  It's a fat outfit.  Where'd you get it?  Me.  That's a nice outfit.  Now, who do you want to win it for best group?  Me.  Best new artist?  Me.  Okay.  Okay.  She wants to win.  All right.  Anybody else?  No.  Okay.  All right.  I wish you a lot of luck.  Thank you.  All right.  Best luck.  All right.  Holy God.  Let him speak, Little Moe.  Couldn't get a word.  Me.  Me.  That's a fat outfit. 
[01:19:00]  That's a fat outfit.  That's a fat outfit.  So's her perm.  These ladies have never met a celebrity before.  They have no clue who these people are or anything.  They weren't nervous at all.  They just went with it.  It gets so much better.  Look at all the people they had interactions with.  Okay.  Who are we seeing next?  All right.  This is when Nate Dogg came by and they thought they saw Kato Kaelin.  No way.  Kato Kaelin, we should say, was not at the VMA.  No.  But they thought they saw him in the middle of this Nate Dogg interview.  This is actually a little longer. 
[01:19:30]  We got a little something out of Nate Dogg.  Oh, did we?  Yeah.  This is the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Check it out.  Nate Dogg, how are you?  Excuse me.  What's your name?  Nick.  Nate Dogg, how are you?  Nick.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Okay.  Next to my outfit, I got to ask you one question.  What?  Who are you hoping to win?  Best group?  Best group.  Who's nominated for best group?  I have no idea.  You tell me.  That's information I'm waiting to hear.  Okay.  All right.  That's a nice outfit. 
[01:20:00]  Nice hat.  Where'd you get it?  Nice sunglasses.  I had it made.  One of my friends made it.  Woody Wood.  Okay.  Nice.  Okay.  Nice outfit.  I wish you a lot of luck.  Well, thanks a lot.  Okay.  All right.  What do you sing?  Hey, Kato Kaelin.  What's my Kato Kaelin?  What's my Kato Kaelin?  She just blows him off.  She blows off Nate Dogg because she thought she was on Kato Kaelin.  Nate Dogg was still talking and she just yells out,  Kato Kaelin.  It doesn't get much bigger than Nate Dogg at the VMAs and she's excited because she might 
[01:20:30]  have seen Kato Kaelin.  They make Joan and Melissa look like Barbara Walters and Hugh Darragh.  Oh, yeah.  The best part, Ben was right next to them and every time the interaction, we can't even  call them interviews ended, Ben would go, oh, I'm so sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I really have to apologize.  I got to pop the picture up just so I can get the visual.  Oh, the visual.  The one doing most of the talking, the little blonde hair troll.  Yeah.  And the one that's just like her yes man, the big one here, Lady Di, who I say should 
[01:21:00]  also use that as a verb.  All right.  Lady Di.  All right.  All right.  You want to hear Will Ferrell?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That should be interesting.  Yeah.  That was good.  All right.  Hit the tape.  Hey, Will Ferrell.  Hey, Will Ferrell.  Hey, Will Ferrell.  Hey, Will Ferrell, how you doing?  I can't ask you questions.  Come here.  Hey, nice shirt.  Tic-tac-toe, buddy.  All right.  How you doing?  Hey, nice shirt.  How you doing?  I like the earrings.  Nice glasses.  He's scooping up.  He's scooping on Marion. 
[01:21:30]  He took time out to scoop on Marion.  Nice glasses.  That is so damn funny.  Yeah, Will Ferrell walks by, and he's wearing this, like, checkered shirt kind of thing.  Hey, nice shirt.  Tic-tac-toe.  And Will Ferrell turns around and looks at Marion with those spectacles on.  There are spectacles in spectacles.  Mario is speechless.  I cannot believe it.  And he has nice glasses. 
[01:22:00]  Now, wouldn't you rather hear this than Ann and I getting blown off?  Well, I don't think you would have been blown off.  I don't know.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we would have been.  You're O and A.  I'd rather hear this, though.  The funniest thing is that Marion is just screaming things.  Will Ferrell, how are you?  And Lady Di is just thinking she's at some kind of a dinner party or something.  Hi, Will Ferrell.  How are you?  How are you?  As he's just looking like they just crawled out of a spaceship.  He's looking at them. 
[01:22:30]  Unfortunately, it is radio.  And I cannot stress the fact that all these people, they would hear the screaming, turn  their head, look at these two.  And the response, the look on their face was just, oh, my God, how did they get in here?  Yeah.  And Mario, the publicist, none of them had a sense of humor.  A lot of them started blowing us off because, oh, we don't want to be a part of this.  Trying to run block.  And we had the perfect spot on the red carpet.  They had the rest of the media all corralled, crunched together, and we had wide open space.  So we looked like we were a real special thing. 
[01:23:00]  As much open space as you could have when the retarded Laverne and Shirley are in it.  Yeah, it looked like you had a special thing until they saw Mary and Edith over there.  Edith from New Jersey.  You want to hear the interaction with the Backstreet Boys?  Oh, yeah.  We've got to do that one.  Oh, Backstreet Boys.  All right, here we go.  Hey, Backstreet Boys.  Hey, Backstreet Boys.  Hey, Backstreet Boys.  Hey, come here, guys.  Backstreet Boys.  Come on, Mr. Fair.  Hey, come here.  We're from Laverne.  Hello, the Anthony Show.  Hi, guys.  Hi, backstreet Boys. 
[01:23:30]  Hi, you're hanging out.  Hi.  I can't believe I know their names.  What did she say was hanging out?  She is one of the girls that were walking with one of them.  She goes, hey, your boobs are hanging out.  I don't know if we have it, but at one point, Marion goes to one of the girls.  You know the look with the hip huggers, with the underwear sticking out on the back?  Yeah, you have the thong that goes above the hip huggers.  Let's see.  There you go.  There's the look.  Look at that. 
[01:24:00]  Right?  Isn't that a hot look?  It's a very hot look.  But that's the same thing with kicking it with the homies with the boxes up the ass.  Right.  Exactly.  One of the ladies walks by with that look, and Marion goes,  Hey, pull up your pants.  Your underwear is showing.  Pull up your pants.  Your underwear is showing.  Pull up your pants.  Like she's doing him a favor.  You're going to the waist now.  Pull up your pants.  Can you see Joe?  Joe is going, what are you wearing?  Joe Boxer?  Your pants and your ass is hanging out.  Pull up, Melissa.  Who do you have?  You got Nellie? 
[01:24:30]  Fabulous.  You're fabulous.  You're so fabulous.  Melissa, who do you have?  Mother!  Fabulous.  Fabulous.  Everything's fabulous.  No, I'm talking to fabulous.  No, I have fabulous.  You're fabulous.  It's fabulous.  Aren't they awful?  Oh, God.  They're the worst.  We hate them.  Melissa, who do you have?  Nellie?  I'm so Nellie right now.  Hey, Kevin.  Yeah?  What's up?  How are you?  Good.  We're trying to get...  What's that?  This was a mistake.  Kevin, come on.  Let's go.  What do you got?  Oh, I got just a thought. 
[01:25:00]  If Kimmy and Mario looked up, that would be the second king of Queens he had.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  But I'm not from Queens.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  Thanks, Kevin.  Suck it.  This was a good save by Kevin.  Do you want to play a couple more before break?  Oh, hell yeah.  We have so many.  I got the picture up right in front of me, so I'm almost there.  I feel like I'm there.  When I hear that Marion babble...  A lot of these, you know, a lot of these are, you know, the celebrities walking by us really 
[01:25:30]  fast, but there is some of these where they actually interviewed them for a while.  Yeah.  This is the group 741, right?  Some 41.  Who wrote 741?  Oh, some 41.  Of course.  Okay.  741.  Because they say that.  All right.  741.  Oh, okay.  Hi.  Wait.  Because they say...  I'm like, what's...  Okay.  It's...  741.  Come here.  All right.  741.  It's a couple of places.  Hey, you look like the bike. 
[01:26:00]  We love your hair.  We love that hairdo.  Beautiful.  Did you see that?  Hey, yo, come here.  I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.  You look like Swake.  You know, your hair's too...  You have to gel.  Okay.  Whatever you gel, you need to move.  Hey, yo, you need to shave.  She's just criticizing.  What is it saying?  Is she spitting on them as she's talking?  I want to know.  Yes, absolutely.  Is it saying?  She has a tongue, like one of the big tongues you see at the supermarket, sticking out of her 
[01:26:30]  mouth, and she's got that lip, where she can't even talk.  Where's I got sort of a kind of a brain?  This is her.  We were goofing on her one day, and she goes, I have sort of a kind of a brain, she was trying  to say.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  I got sort of a kind of a brain.  All right.  You need to fire them in no time flat.  We love them.  You need to get rid of them.  This is just... 
[01:27:00]  I can't believe...  This is like a psychedelic trip with a little bit of quaalude mixed in.  It's very strange.  I'll tell you this much.  We entertain everyone that works for MTV.  Oh, they loved it.  They were all standing there watching.  They were standing there watching, just laughing at these people.  All right.  As we move forward, it's the band O-Town.  Hey, O-Town.  Come here.  I want to ask you a couple questions.  We're from the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hi.  How are you?  Hi.  We have a couple questions.  Who do you want to win besides you guys? 
[01:27:30]  We're not up for anything tonight.  Okay.  What do you have?  We're not up for nothing?  You don't sing?  No.  We're just visiting.  We're here to watch a free concert.  We're from the O.P. and Anthony show.  I'm married.  I'm here to watch the VMA's free concert.  That's what it is.  It's a combination of all the best artists of the year, or biggest artists of the year.  Okay.  You know what?  I like, I don't know who's up, really, but I like Incubus Drive's new album, new video  a lot.  Who's the guy standing behind you?  This is Dan, my friend Dan.  This is my friend Ashley.  Hi, how are you?  Hi, how are you? 
[01:28:00]  Okay.  What's the guy?  How are you?  Hi, how are you?  Stupid friggin' lady doc.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  Hi.  The next one is Brian McFadden.  Yes, yes.  Brian McFadden from MTV.  New York will remember him as Alter Boy on Kane's old night show.  Yeah, when you watch him on MTV and you see it's Brian McFadden around the country, you  just know him as Brian McFadden.  Here, he was the sidekick of Kane before Kane got cabby. 
[01:28:30]  But he wasn't really allowed to talk on that show.  They kept his mic really low.  Yeah, they wouldn't let him talk, and he really had zero to add to Kane's show.  Zero.  And then he got picked up by MTV.  God bless him.  What the hell do you know?  But we would not let him get away with being called his real name.  We told the retarded of Vernon Shelley to just refer to him as Alter Boy, his radio name.  Hey, Alter Boy.  Hey, you're a tool. 
[01:29:00]  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  How you been?  Who are you?  Hey, you're a tool.  My radio name.  Hey, you're a tool.  Hey, who do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah.  Michael Jackson.  I can't do it.  Michael Jackson.  I can't do it.  You guys.  When are you going to have some talent?  That's too funny.  I'm sorry.  We'll go on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Wait.  We'll go on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, what happened to your hair?  What happened to your hair?  Hey, what happened to yours?  That thing happened to yours.  All right. 
[01:29:30]  I'm drained.  That is too friggin' much.  I am drained.  Hey, tool.  Hey, you tool.  Mario, we have another 30 of these.  Wow.  To be continued on page 69.  Hey, you tool.  When are you going to get some talent?  Hey, you tool.  You're tool.  Tool.  Yeah.  Calling people tool.  That's great.  Oh, I have mercy.  We definitely have to take a break.  We're just getting started.  And on the way, we have Will Farrell walking by the second time.  Dale Earnhardt Jr., which is just, oh, my God. 
[01:30:00]  Fat Boy Slim and up next, Ja Rule.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  And Mario sitting in.  I'm drained.  Playing Caroline Sunday at 8.  Sunday at 8.  You are going.  Kimmy from Survivor.  Hang in today.  Oh, the Kimmy.  Oh, sorry.  Yes.  Can you play that one more time?  Please.  Yeah.  You know something?  We might want to do that one more time.  Just play it at the break.  Hey, that's a boy.  Hey, you're a tool.  How are you doing?  How are you?  Good.  How you been?  Hey, you're a tool.  My radio days.  That's awesome. 
[01:30:30]  Hey, you're a tool.  How do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah.  Michael Jackson.  It's Kane doing.  Michael Jackson.  It's Kane doing.  I love you guys.  When are you going to have some talent?  It's too funny.  What's up, man?  Hey, we're following the O.P. and Anthony show.  It's our fight.  Remember when we almost started?  We're following the O.P. and Anthony show.  No, I don't remember that.  Hey, what happened to your hair?  What happened to the hair?  Hey, what happened to yours?  What happened to yours?  It is Jim Brewer.  Oh, yeah!  The hair is about to rock! 
[01:31:00]  Fire!  You listen to O.P. and Ant.  Ow!  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, O.P. and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York.  You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a smooth criminal.  And we're back with the O.N.A. show.  Mario, you've got to be into the alien ant farm.  I love the alien what?  Alien ant farm.  I love them.  Smooth criminal? 
[01:31:30]  But the Michael Jackson original is pretty great.  I'm going to see him Monday night.  Oh, yeah?  And guess who's performing with him?  Who?  Liza Minnelli.  What the hell is she doing?  That conversation must have been like, Liza, I want to do a medley of You Are Not Alone  into Over the Rainbow.  And she's like, I don't sing my mother's songs.  It tears me up.  But please, for me.  Okay, I'll do it for you, Michael.  And she's going to get up and be like, you are not alone.  Stuck into other words.  Call me on the phone. 
[01:32:00]  Leave a message at the tone.  You are not alone.  Can I call you on the phone?  I thought she was in the hospital.  Well, I said no.  She's doing really well.  She's lost weight.  She looks great.  She's going to be like the new Liz Taylor to look at as far as the weight gain and the  weight loss.  I bet she loses it again, though.  She goes up and down.  Call me on the phone.  Liza, those aren't the words.  You are not alone. 
[01:32:30]  Liza, stop.  Call me on the phone.  Leave a message at the tone.  Liza, those aren't the words.  I don't really care.  Fix my pretty hair.  All right.  Mario playing Caroline.  Sunday at 8.  Sunday at 8 o'clock.  Also in the studio, we got Kimmy from Survivor 2, the Australian Outback. 
[01:33:00]  They didn't pick you for the real-world Survivor thing they did.  Hey, what happened there?  I mean, not real-world.  The Big Brother Survivor Challenge.  Survivor crossover thing.  They had Jeff and Alicia.  They pulled a Jetson Flintstones move there, and you weren't part of it.  Yeah, they really did do that whole thing.  I think because Jeff's out in L.A. now, and I think Alicia was out there at the same  time.  But that's okay, because I've been doing other things anyway.  That's right.  And we're all going to the Emmys.  You're going to the Emmys?  Yeah, so we really have to think of some great scandalous thing to do.  You said you were going to do something, though, on that stupid reunion show that you did 
[01:33:30]  with Brian Gumball.  Brian Gumball.  Oh, well, no, because we were going to talk about the whipped cream bikini thing, but they  totally would never go over that way.  Oh, come on.  I got us in the Inquiry.  Wasn't that enough?  That was.  Yeah.  Hey, sweet Inquiry.  You got us in the Inquiry.  I love that.  I love being in the Inquiry.  I think Big Cat has something on.  I think Big Cat has something on things Kimmy has been doing.  Oh, okay.  What do I do now? 
[01:34:00]  I saw Kimmy in Chicago at the big Comic-Con.  Chicago!  Chicago!  Hello, child!  And we got pictures together.  Really?  And she was signing her new trading card.  They made a trading card game out of Survivor.  Right.  Oh, oh, oh.  And another thing, like all these people are standing online, and everybody, you know,  I'm signing them their little cards, and some guy comes up to me, and he pulls out these  two white pieces of paper, and he goes, these are top secret. 
[01:34:30]  It flips them over, and of course, what are they?  They're me in the 102.7 N-E-W whipped cream bikini.  The picture of the bikini.  So I signed it to the guy.  I said, I got creamed at N-E-W.  Now, what were you signing?  What are the little cards?  They're like little upper deck trading cards.  They come in the bottom of a little cracker deck box.  Yeah, no, they're like Pokemon.  Oh, Pokemon!  But a lot of people in Chicago knew you guys.  You're going to get, let me tell you what kind of cards you're going to get.  You're going to get a Kimmy Survivor 2 card. 
[01:35:00]  A Kimmy Survivor 2 card.  Totally naked.  Totally naked.  And a McGuire and a Social Rookie card.  Even though they're fake.  You want the naked Richard Hatch?  We got it.  We got it.  I have the naked Richard Hatch one.  Do you?  Yeah, but they blurred out his little box.  It was a very little box.  Who cares?  You know what?  I don't want to see him naked.  No one wants to see Richard Hatch naked.  No one wanted to see him naked.  Put your clothes on. 
[01:35:30]  Put your seat away.  We even got a Cal whack in his bag.  Cal, remember, he went out of the woods and jerked it like a monkey.  We get it.  Be dialing, people.  Give me three minutes on the clock.  Remember that guy, Don West?  He rocked.  It's really funny.  Then they took him off for the show.  Perfect.  Isn't that the guy that I insulted and told him to go kill himself?  No, no.  That was someone else.  We never had Don West on the show.  That was Pete Best.  Oh, Pete Best. 
[01:36:00]  Pete Best, Don West.  I'm the drummer for the Beatles.  You want to hear something?  We have Pete Best, who used to drum for the Beatles, obviously, before they got Ringo.  And you know, the guy that bought the lottery ticket just before the guy that bought the  winning one, right?  Yeah.  Who bought the quick pick right before the other guy bought the winning quick pick?  And Kimmy's in the studio as we're interviewing the great Pete Best.  He was there from the beginning, right?  What did you say to Pete?  What did you say to him, Kim?  I asked him if he was happy when John Lennon got shot.  Oh! 
[01:36:30]  Are you even a little happy?  It's time for you to go home.  Can you believe that?  I'm taking my bat, my pull, my glove, and I'm going home.  You?  No.  Just sit down and be quiet.  Shut yourself up.  You want to talk about uncomfortable, just like, oh.  Anyway, we've got to say hi to Mike from Real World New York.  Hello, Mike.  Our new friend.  Mike.  We met him on the red carpet last night.  You did?  And you came here?  Yeah.  I was like, hey, Opie and Anthony, what are you guys doing here, you know?  I was like, that's what I'm talking about.  Mike.  Mike, so who's the homo on the show?  There is no one.  There's no homosexuals on the show this year. 
[01:37:00]  You'll find out.  Someone will be doing something with somebody in the...  You know, that show's a sick show because I don't watch reality TV.  I will not watch it, but it's the only one I do watch is the real world.  And the marathon, it's like, okay, just one.  The marathon's addictive.  You can't get enough.  Like, just one more.  I got meetings.  I got one more.  Just one more.  Let me just see, you know, if this one gets her mouth untied.  Remember the girl that...  Remember her?  She wired her mouth.  She wired her mouth.  She wired her mouth.  That was Real World L.A.  Oh, that's when they kicked out David. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  Yes.  It was stupid that they kicked him out because he didn't do it.  It was the first guy I ever kicked out of a reality.  All right.  I'm feeling unloved.  I got to go, though, because my car's calling.  All right, Kimmy.  What?  You got...  You're making me leave.  Is that a two-way, yo?  No, it's not.  Yo, you need a two-way.  We learned about the two-way.  CBS had me out here to go do stuff, so now they're making me go do stuff.  We learned that the cell phones aren't anything anymore.  You need the two-way.  Tech toll is out.  Beep.  Yeah, you need the two-way.  Look, I just got over a beeper, so I'm, like, moving up.  All right, Kimmy, could you flash this before you leave one more time?  One more. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, hey.  Look how easy it is.  Other shows have a tough time having to do that.  Those are real, too.  I know.  There's no scars.  There's no, like, you know, separation.  They're real.  So, yeah.  And don't ask me how I know I know.  All right, Kimmy.  Okay, bye, guys.  Thank you so much for letting me come down.  She is such a nympho freak.  Keep going.  I'll come back, though, and that way we can, like, talk about all, like, the dirty, nasty  stuff that we did in my interviews.  Hey, Kimmy, give me a big kiss.  Goodbye.  Come on.  Will you be effing somebody tonight?  Give me a kiss.  Ooh.  Wow.  I'm only kidding.  You're gorgeous.  You're so pretty.  You're really good. 
[01:38:30]  I'd make out with you.  I'd make out with you.  Mario, nothing?  No, nothing.  But she's pretty, you know.  Nothing.  It's amazing.  You know something, though, I got to tell you.  Nothing.  All right?  Shut up, then.  Look how easy it is for him to get kissed like that.  I can grab him.  Like, he just walks up to girls and goes, yeah, kiss me.  Look at...  I'm grabbing a breath.  He's confident.  That's my friend Kimmy.  He's confident.  Nothing.  But it's okay.  It's okay.  All right.  It's all right.  Jesus.  It's like your mom doing it.  Yeah, it's your baby.  Why do we get him?  Is that, like, violating?  No, just get out. 
[01:39:00]  You know, if you're running a scam about this whole being gay thing, you're a genius.  I know.  You're a goddamn genius.  It's all a big lie, you guys.  Ma'am, you know what I'm going to do to get laid?  I'm going to just let everybody have a big fag.  Okay, peace out.  See you later.  Peace out.  Take it easy.  Yeah, peace out of your dick.  Peace out.  And when she goes out...  Peace out of that piece, you guys.  Peace in.  By the way, someone's...  It's a sausage factory left for you in here.  By the way, 2020 Downtown, if you're listening, see, gay guys use the word fag on our show. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, you know, look, you know, like I said, you're going to have trouble with that.  Look, but you have a huge gay following.  You have a big gay following.  Gay men love you.  Oh, I've got to tell you.  Like?  You know, I'm going to tell you, my show is, like, my friend, I won't mention your name,  my friend John, who turned me on to the show, and also, when Caroline's, which the show  was packed last week, and I mentioned on the show, I said that gay men do not come out  to see me.  I said if I was a lip-syncing drag queen, they'd be out in droves. 
[01:40:00]  But there were more...  They proved me wrong.  They had a lot of gay men came out, and there was a bunch of gay boys that had just graduated  at Emerson College that said, you know, we heard you on Opie and Anthony, and we brought  a few boys with us because you said that they don't...  You're the boys.  And then another guy said to me, you know, you're wrong.  And I said, I know what you're talking about.  I said, I'm wrong tonight, but I'm not wrong all the time.  And I said, I said, they're proving me wrong, and I'm glad, I'm glad, because I want them  to come, you know.  Isn't that great, though?  You know something?  You used the word fag.  Can Kimmy use the word slut?  Or trap. 
[01:40:30]  Hussey.  She's a hussy.  A hussy.  She's a trap and a hussy, but she's a lovely girl.  You know, she doesn't need to be showing her breasts on television, on radio.  That chick loves the ox.  She, you know...  She loves the ox.  She can't stop talking about getting late.  Well, she's a commercial.  She gave us four great stories that we can't even tell on the air.  It's called need.  Yeah?  It's need.  Need?  And I said, Jerry, you've got to rein it in a little bit, because you're beautiful, and  you don't need to be that needy.  Needy.  She was a whore. 
[01:41:00]  From the Sopranos.  Hey.  Hey, we got, we got to get, yeah, we got Lady Di.  Hold on, we got, which one you want to go to?  Mary?  I want to do Carol and Brian, because they were there, and I want to hear that.  Where?  They went on for an hour.  Oh, all right, hold on.  Do that one.  Hello.  Carolyn.  Hey.  How are you?  Oh, it's Caroline, Brian.  Sorry.  Sweet Caroline.  What's up?  I just wanted to say, I saw Mario Cantona a couple weeks ago at Caroline's, and he was  so hysterically funny.  Oh, Caroline.  He was, you were on forever. 
[01:41:30]  What were you on?  Like an hour and 45 minutes?  Yeah, I did about an hour and 50 minutes, actually.  Oh, you'll get your money's worth.  Yeah, you'll get your money's worth.  I'll sing them all, and we'll stay all night.  Caroline, I'm really glad you were there with Brian.  We're all going Sunday at 8.  Oh, it was so incredible.  Everyone should go.  Wow.  It's the most remarkable stand-up I think I've seen ever.  Cool.  My goodness.  Well, that's really great.  All right, Caroline.  All right.  I needed a little ego boost.  Thank you, Caroline.  Thanks.  Thank you, Brian.  Hey, we've got to get back to Mike from the real world.  Mike.  Because we have on me.  Well, Mike, you know.  I'm taking the starlight over here.  Because I'm not just a pretty face. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, I'll just sit over here in the corner, all right?  I'll just sit over here in the corner, all right?  I didn't have high cheekbones.  I had to work for my talent.  We met him on the red carpet last night.  He's a very nice young man.  What do you think when you came walking up to us and you saw the retard Laverne Shirley interviewing  the whole cast of the real world?  I couldn't understand him.  I had no idea what he said.  I was like, what?  Huh?  You know, I'm trying to talk, I'm trying to be nice, you know, but you don't understand  him, so you feel like an idiot, you know?  Yeah, you're like, this can't possibly be real.  And so I was like, wait a second, this is Sophie and Anthony.  I was like, oh, all right, never mind. 
[01:42:30]  Hi, you want me to be a man?  I want me to be a man?  You want me to be a man?  I don't know, do you want me to be a man?  Puck?  It sounds like you've got a puck in your mouth.  I hope you're not going to be a puck.  Huh?  No, I'm not a puck.  No, you're much nicer than Puck.  I'm more, I'm much nicer than Puck.  Puck was cool.  Maybe like, what, like Pedro?  Pedro.  No, no, no.  Let me tell you, Puck, I saw you scratch your scabs, then you took your finger and put  it in the peanut butter.  I saw, Puck, I saw you pick your scabs and put your finger in the peanut butter. 
[01:43:00]  Yes, we're in love, it's good, we're getting married.  Pedro.  Pedro, he rocked on that show, it was so funny.  And that was the best thing to happen to tell him.  Pedro.  And Pedro had HIV.  Yeah.  Yes, he did, and he died.  Look, I think I might have to leave the house.  This is not a healthy environment for me to live in.  It's either me or Puck.  Me or Puck goes.  It's like Jesse Arnett on the real world.  Hello, Lucy.  Get Mrs. Tramble to watch Little Ricky and then come down to the club. 
[01:43:30]  Puck, I'm home.  Lady Diwan.  Hey, Rick.  Lady Diwan wants in here.  Lady.  Lucy, I'm home.  Oh, Jesus.  I heard everything you said.  What?  Mary Kentone, I love you.  I love you, ladies.  And John Balby, by the way, I love you too.  Lady Di, you are too funny.  Balby left two hours ago.  Thank you, you whore.  Thank you, you fat piece of crap.  I love you too.  So, Lady Di, what's up?  You had a good time yesterday.  We had a great time yesterday. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  We had a wonderful time yesterday.  Yeah.  And you know, whenever you want to call us, go ahead and call us.  We'll do the same thing over again.  Whatever you want to do.  All right.  Thank you.  No problem.  You added a lot to the show.  Thank you, Lady Di.  I thought I told you to shut up.  Hey, Paul, what's going on?  Paul was hanging out with us on the red carpet yesterday.  Paul, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, man?  I'm kind of feeling bad that Lady Di is listening because I just wanted to call in and make fun of them so bad.  They don't mind, go ahead. 
[01:44:30]  Do what you got to do.  No, I mean, they're nice people, but even the celebrities, they're like the big ones.  Who are you?  Who are you?  Yo, yo, yo.  They were calling like City High.  Yo, Cisco, Cisco, come here.  We're going to play more of the clips that you guys missed when we went off the air today.  Cisco.  All right, Paul, thank you.  All right, thank you.  We're moving a mile in a minute here.  Cisco, can I ask you, Cisco is kind of Cisco.  Really?  I don't know.  Cisco is a little, Cisco is such a, I don't want to get into it.  And he sings the thong song?  Oh, please. 
[01:45:00]  You can, I can't, I shouldn't even say anything.  Let's shut up.  Jay, what's up?  Jay, what's up?  Hey, boys, what's going on?  Hey.  I got a question for Mike from The Real World.  What's up, man?  I just want to know, how bad do you just want to bitch slap that chick coral that you live with?  I think everyone's been asking me this question, you know?  Yeah, what's the deal?  I got to tell Pitt.  He was on The Real World, New York.  When did it start?  You've been watching it?  Not the new one, no.  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm a busy person.  I have a career, okay?  Dress you up, can't take any worries.  I don't hang out with 10 people for four months.  Unbelievable.  Okay, wait. 
[01:45:30]  When was it on?  When did it start?  It's on Tuesday at 10 o'clock.  But when did it start?  Oh, like two months ago.  Where is it?  They run it for the next two years.  All right, I'll see the marathon for the next two years.  Yeah, some hungover Sunday.  One more.  They labeled him the ignorant country boy that didn't understand black culture.  But I'm from Parkville, Ohio.  It's not even a small town.  I was like, you know, I was like, oh, my God.  Wow.  I assumed that I was like, you know.  And the black chicks had a, you know, problem.  Like the John character from L.A.  L.A. Real World?  Yeah, yeah.  Jeez, that was a sad cast. 
[01:46:00]  Do you like the black women?  Have you ever been with a black woman?  Have I ever been with one?  No, I've never been with one.  But I mean, I'm open-minded.  I mean, whatever.  You know, if Tyra Banks wants to date me, hey, I'm right here.  You know what I'm saying?  That's Tyra Banks.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm not talking about Tyra Banks.  I'm talking about Laquisha down the street.  Florida Evans.  James!  Yes, James!  Florida!  James!  I'm James.  If she's looking good, I'm there for her, you know?  I'm sure you are.  Good.  Florida's big dramatic scene.  Do you have a woman in your life?  Damn!  Damn!  Damn! 
[01:46:30]  Remember that one?  My mother would do it like this.  She would watch this, and she's like, she's a terrible actress.  She's horrible, but a troll.  I like how she looked like she had the pack of hot dogs taken to the back of her neck.  Yeah, it's the, Walona, you were, remember Walona?  Walona.  Walona was like, hi, baby, how you doing?  Yeah.  She'd come in like a big flourish, hi, girl, what's going on?  And Janet Jackson.  Janet Jackson was, yeah.  She was in that.  Who else was on there?  She was Penny.  She was Penny.  That's right.  Little Penny, that was a beat, her parents beat her.  Oh, God. 
[01:47:00]  And then she had to be adopted by Walona.  Walona?  Gee, it's like, it's like going from the frying pan into the fire.  I know.  It's like, oh, yeah, my parents are beating me, maybe someone will adopt me.  It's Walona, who's also broke.  Yeah, broke and single and having a good time.  Yeah.  Say!  No, she was a good mother, Walona.  All right, do you have a woman in your life, Mike?  No, I do not.  I am currently single.  How old are you?  I'm 20.  Gee.  No one's 20.  Don't tell me the bars are there.  No one's 20.  No one's 20.  Nobody's 20.  You're 20?  Yeah, how old are you? 
[01:47:30]  Shut your big, long face.  What's wrong?  If I could say my, come on.  I'll tell you how old I am.  How old?  How old?  I am.  I'm 41.  Are you serious?  Wow.  Oh, you're 41?  Yeah, I'm 41.  I'll be 42 in December.  And I look damn good.  Let me tell you something about you white boys.  You're going to age harshly.  Oh, my God.  What's your background?  What's the background?  Swedish, Irish?  I'm everything.  You're everything?  Yeah.  Like, just like corn stalks and what?  I'm like Czechoslovakian, Polish.  Okay.  Hungarian.  You're Hungarian?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  Well, that's good.  We've got to play more clips of the Retard of the Verde and Sterling.  Let's get back to some more of these clips, all right?  This is funny.  Anthony, let's set up once again.  We're playing the clips from yesterday.  We did the whole show from the VMAs, from the red carpet, and we had the retarded Laverne  and Shirley, Lady Diane Marion, doing the interviews for us in their inimitable retard style.  And this is all stuff you didn't hear because the action heated up after we got off the air  yesterday.  So here they are interviewing or interacting with Ja Rule.  Funny, man.  How are you? 
[01:48:30]  I'm married.  That's Danya.  Okay.  Good to meet you.  Okay.  What do you want to win?  Envita.  You guys.  You're new artists.  Us.  That's good.  Okay.  You know, we ought to come up.  I'm a new artist.  She's grinding, trying to put my point to the world.  How old are you?  I don't know what's waiting.  Don't tell us a lot.  Hey.  Oh, I know.  You're young anyway.  Where'd you get the outfit?  I like it.  The outfit is very nice.  Actually, it's fine for me.  Except the shoes.  I'd like to get an outfit like that.  Yeah.  I'll talk my finger a little bit. 
[01:49:00]  I'll let that jam and I'll help you out.  Okay.  Very good.  Thank you.  I just wanted to let y'all know that I'm working on my album.  It's almost finished.  It's titled La Dolce Vita.  And it's coming real soon.  It should be out in January or February.  Right.  We'll be looking for it.  Your baby got fat.  That's right.  Baby got fat.  Baby's physique.  I don't got that much.  But I don't know.  We can see.  We know.  We can think.  Okay.  I had a body like that.  You're good.  You're good.  You look good.  You look good.  You're from the O.P. and Anthony show.  Thanks.  I wish you luck. 
[01:49:30]  These people are making fun of Bethany.  Who are they making fun of Bethany with?  They're making fun of the celebrities over here.  Who were they talking to?  Who was that?  It was Vita.  Ja Rule was with her, but didn't really speak up.  Vita?  Yeah.  New artist.  Vita.  You know who Vita was?  Vita was Joan Crawford's daughter in Mildred Pierce.  Vitamin of Edumens.  Vita.  I'd rather cut off my hands than hit you like that.  Vita.  Vita let go of me.  The girl didn't have an ounce of fat on her.  Okay.  Can I?  She said, I think she meant to say baby got back. 
[01:50:00]  But she goes back.  She goes, baby got fat.  Baby got fat.  Baby got fat.  Baby got fat.  That's fat.  And she was nice back.  She's like, I don't really kind of petite.  I don't have much fat on her.  I want Vita.  This girl's going to stick her finger down her throat.  I know.  You just turned her into an anorexic.  I love what you said.  I want to prove my point to the world.  And your point is?  And what about talking about her outfit?  I need an outfit like that.  A lady died.  I need an outfit like that to show off my figure.  She has an ass like a Lego.  I swear to God.  We were looking at the back view of both of them. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  We were looking at the back view of both of them.  They were wearing these smart slacks.  You know, kind of one of those little outfits.  And Lady Di's ass is square.  She has a Lego square ass.  Let's put it this way.  She has one of those asses that she has to wear a belt so you know where the butt begins.  Yeah.  It just goes.  There is no.  So the Lego being just like a lot of bumps there too?  Is that what you're saying?  Well, I didn't look that close and the pants were a little looser.  But no, then it could be the Rubik's Cube ass. 
[01:51:00]  Whatever square object you want to put in there.  Because Legos have those ridges.  Right.  All right.  So that represents the cellulite.  The imagery of what you were talking about.  You know, it was good imagery.  It really was.  We've got to get through a few more of these because on the way is Dale Earnhardt Jr., which  is priceless.  There we go.  But first, here's the retarded Laverne Shirley as Fatboy Slim walks by.  Hey, Fatboy.  Hey, who?  Hey, Fatboy.  Fatboy.  Hey, Fatboy.  Yay, yay, party.  Can I party with you guys? 
[01:51:30]  Can I party with you guys?  I party with you guys.  Hey, what are you doing later, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Like they would go, hey, you get her.  Look, I just walked the red carpet.  I came in the door.  I know I've got to get to my backstage area, but I've got to tell you something.  I saw a chick on the red carpet to my left that wants to party with me.  You've got to get her name because I need to party with this effing troll.  Well, the sad part is they're dead serious.  I know.  That's the funny part about it.  Yeah, these girls hung out.  They hung out since the early 80s.  They've been friends forever, like Laverne and Shirley. 
[01:52:00]  And the battle cry used to be, yin-yang party, because I guess people told them they were  like yin and yang.  They would always be together.  So they would all go around back in the early 80s to the turtle races at various pubs.  That was their exciting nights out.  And say, yin-yang party and drink.  So now they're trying to bring it back, I guess.  Yelling it to celebrities.  Maybe one of them will pick it up, right?  Right.  Yo, man, yin-yang party.  Yin-yang party.  Did you imagine that?  You start seeing this go up on a war show.  It's going to stick. 
[01:52:30]  Yo, yo, yo, yin-yang party.  You're Carson Daly, you know.  Yin-yang party, dude.  T-R-L, yin-yang party.  Yo, man, first I'd like to thank God.  Yin-yang party, you know.  All right.  This was a nobody VIP walking the red carpet.  Who was that?  Hey, yo, guys, who are you?  Hi.  How are you?  Nobody.  You guys don't look like nobody.  How come you guys get VIP? 
[01:53:00]  She's just bashing people for having better passes than she had.  MTV people walked by.  They had to yell at everybody that walked by them.  Hey, MTV.  What about yesterday?  We had the interview of the woman that was vacuuming the red carpet before everybody walked on.  And she's like, you've got to change the vacuum bag.  It's not working.  She's giving her household hints on how to vacuum the red carpet.  Oh, I cannot.  You need vacuum bags.  Wait, we do have that.  Wait, where's that, Yamika?  We have that clip from yesterday, Anthony. 
[01:53:30]  We are now listening to the sounds of the vacuum that is cleaning the red carpet here at the VMA.  And Opie Horrified, listen to that, Opie.  What the fuck?  Opie hates vacuum.  That is the very vacuum that is cleaning the carpet here, folks.  How exciting is this?  Vacuum lady.  What kind of vacuum are you using?  What kind of vacuum?  Miss, what kind of vacuum are you using?  It doesn't work well.  It looks like you need a new vacuum.  Yeah, yeah.  I agree.  Look at it. 
[01:54:00]  I mean, it looks really bad.  You need a new vacuum cleaner.  They got to get you a new vacuum cleaner.  Like she needs this.  Hey, did they use it?  It's not picking up.  The woman's horrible.  She's so pissed.  She's trying to do her job.  She's not picking up anything.  She needs a new vacuum cleaner.  Lady Di, talk to the vacuum lady.  She does need a new vacuum cleaner.  And she went way on the other side of the carpet, too.  She's got to come back, though.  She's vacuuming concrete to her.  She needs an old bag.  When you're done, you've got to change the bag.  The bag will rip. 
[01:54:30]  They're flying all over the place.  Maybe she could use your pad to soak up the dirt with.  Marion, tell her.  Tell her you prefer the Hoover.  Marion, tell her you prefer the Hoover.  I like Eureka.  Look at her.  And living.  She's at living.  Wow.  She's not good with the prom.  Yeah, yeah.  She wants to follow her own path.  Tell her the Hoover.  Tell her Eureka.  I like the Eureka.  I like the Eureka.  We really thought we were going to have to help these two ladies along, 
[01:55:00]  because we didn't know.  And we realized very early on, just let them go.  I hope she was using a wet vac for all the spit that was flying out of Marion's mouth.  We have to move on fast here.  Will Farrell, passing by again.  It's the retarded Laverne Shirley.  Hey, how are you?  Check your shirt guy.  We might do an interview with you.  Hey, check your shirt guy.  Pick that down.  Yeah.  Are you a Polack?  Love those cats.  Like the pants.  What do you buy them at?  The bargain basement? 
[01:55:30]  Are you a Polack?  The best interviewers ever.  Are they?  This is great.  Will Farrell walks by again with a very colorful Czech design shirt,  and she goes,  Hey, we're going to talk to you.  Are you a Polack?  That's nice.  The girls are Polack.  The girls are smart.  Yeah.  They're really in town.  Are you a Polack?  All right.  All right.  Who's next?  Two more before we take a break.  And it really heats up.  After the break, Linkin Park, what they asked them, 
[01:56:00]  they had an actual interview with them and text from the real world.  A lot still to come.  But this is Andy Dick.  Andy Dick!  Hey, Andy, news radio!  Andy, news radio!  Come on, Andy!  Hey, Andy, come here.  What is the interview you guys?  What is the interview you?  Who is the hot chick with Andy Dick?  Andy Dick, news radio!  I love that.  You mean the beard?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  I was just going to say that.  That is a nice...  What happened to Pauly Shore? 
[01:56:30]  What?  Andy Dick walked in with a tall, leggy blonde  that he just had no interest in whatsoever.  Let me tell you something.  He should just shut up and be gay.  Because he's a tortured, unhappy, suicidal, talented, successful man.  And he's miserable.  Yeah.  And it'll at least take a little teat off of him.  Just shut up and go for the crotch. 
[01:57:00]  Shut up!  You know what?  If you're a gay guy and you want to walk in with a chick to make people think you're not gay,  at least walk in with a girl that looks like real women.  Yeah.  They walk in with, oh, he's got the supermodel.  Like, they go way over to the other end and pull out these...  It's ridiculous.  It's very...  Cyber hot chicks.  He's ridiculous.  Don't get me started.  Him in hand.  Ann Heche, that other one.  Don't get me started with her.  Did anybody see the interview? 
[01:57:30]  The 2020 interview with Ann Heche?  Yeah.  Out of her mind.  Well, from the get-go, I said, she's ridiculous.  Okay?  That's the first thing.  She admitted...  She admitted to...  First of all, she was abused as a child.  Okay, fine.  And obviously something happened.  But then she admitted to hearing voices and having another personality named Celestia.  Celestia.  I'm Celestia.  Okay?  She was Celestia all through being with Ellen.  And she admitted all these schizophrenic tendencies without saying the word schizophrenic.  Without saying it.  Then she's like, it took me 31 years, Barbara, to get the craziness out of me. 
[01:58:00]  And you...  She's had therapy, which obviously hasn't worked.  She's not on medication.  Uh-huh.  She's not on medication.  You think this is gone?  No.  You think this schizophrenia is gone and the drugs that you've been doing and you're okay?  And now, now, she's bringing a victim into the world.  A new husband.  Because she's pregnant.  And a baby, right.  You have the balls to have a child when you can't take care of yourself.  Yeah.  You're an ass. 
[01:58:30]  You're an ass.  And you're not even a lesbian ass.  You're a heterosexual ass.  You're an ass.  Ellen is regretting the day she met her.  Hey, she gave Ellen a great plug about sex, though.  But you want to know...  How does Steve Martin feel about that?  She was banging Steve Martin for a while and living with him.  And then she gets on this interview and goes,  The best sex I ever had in my life was with Ellen DeGeneres.  Steve Martin just, but what about me?  Wild and crazy sex. 
[01:59:00]  And, you know, it just emasculated a man right there on national television.  But she's a straight woman.  She is a straight woman.  She's just a woman.  Yeah, she just got crazy and went lesbo for a week or two.  And I think a lot of women do that.  And I think they did that on Sex and the City.  They talked about that.  What's wrong with that?  And there's a lot of women that do that.  In their 30s, discover something with women.  But they really like men more.  And, you know, men don't do that. 
[01:59:30]  No, no.  Now, you know something...  In your 30s, perhaps, maybe?  A woman can cross over.  You know, do that.  And it's experimenting.  And you come back.  Once a guy crosses over, there's no coming back.  You're a big bye-bye sexual.  I don't think there's any crossing back.  Bye-bye sexual.  You're such a cutie pie.  Aunt Margaret.  Bye-bye sexual.  Hey, I have to go.  Hey, I have to go.  Now she pulls up a scaffold on her face. 
[02:00:00]  Roger.  Remember that?  She pulls up a scaffold on her face.  Yeah, she's actually a lovely woman.  I met her once, Aunt Margaret.  Did you?  And I do her and Elvis together, you know.  And I said, I do you a man.  And she was like, oh, what number do you do?  I was like, no, I just kind of.  I don't dress up.  I goof on you.  I just do the shake, you know, with the...  shimmy.  Bye-bye birdie.  Remember the beginning of Bye-bye birdie?  She didn't say birdie.  She said, birdie.  The army's got you now.  Bye-bye birdie. 
[02:00:30]  I feel like I'm watching the Flintstones.  And Margaret.  Oh, and Margaret.  See, they were gay, too.  And Margaret.  And a Barbera.  All right, we've got to take a break.  All right.  Well, Dale Earnhardt Jr. is next.  All right.  There was interaction between the retarded Laverne Shirley  and Dale Earnhardt Jr., Janet Jackson,  Linkin Park, Tech on the way.  Is there another...  Mick Jagger.  ...bump-in with Will Ferrell?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And also, the stuff they said to Tommy Hilfiger.  Yeah.

Hello, MTV.  All right.  I'm here to talk to you all about the Viewers' Choice nominees.  Yes.  Wonderful groups like Destiny's Child and NSYNC.

[02:04:00]  Yeah, that's my highlight from last night.  J-Lo.  That was my favorite part of the whole show right there.  I saw that.  J-Lo pushed him away.  She was like, nah.  She was pissed.  She's not having that.  She has quite a sense of humor about herself, doesn't she, Lo-J?  You know, that dog's a puppet, by the way.  I saw the guy carrying it around.  Yeah, it's just a puppet.  Robert Schmeichel.  Right, Robert.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw that.  It was dead without his hand in it.  Doesn't even move.  Doesn't move, huh?  Is that who's doing the voice? 
[02:04:30]  He's brilliant.  That's a great bit.  I love that.  The Comedy Central show.  Oh, God.  What is it called?  TV Fun House.  TV Fun House.  God, it's so funny.  It's great.  Yeah.  It's sick.  I should tell people we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hello, everybody.  Mike from the real world of New York is in the house.  Is he?  Hi, yeah.  Hi, yo, yo.  Hello, Mike.  Hello, Mike.  Ryan has a question for Mike.  Ryan.  Yo.  You waited all the time, Ryan.  Yo, what's up, guys?  I just want to know if Mike can do some future work with MTV or Arista. 
[02:05:00]  I'm hoping for Arista.  I still do stuff with Arista a lot.  Anytime they ask me to do anything, I'm always there for them.  And then if MTV offers me anything, I'm there.  I mean, that's great.  Yo, I didn't like that show when I first saw it, but when I saw those two black chicks, bro.  Uh-huh.  Oh, man.  You should have killed them.  Just keep watching, dog.  I hope they get it by the body.  Keep watching, because you ain't seen nothing yet, dog.  You ain't seen nothing yet.  Dog.  Yeah.  Dog.  Oh, dog with two Gs, yo.  All right, Ryan. 
[02:05:30]  Thank you.  All right, man.  That's that.  That's that.  All right, dog.  That's that, yo.  All right.  We've got to get to the Dale Earnhardt Jr. thing.  All right.  Everyone's clapping.  Thank you.  You like this one.  Marion.  Lady Di on the red carpet yesterday at the VMAs doing all the interviews in there, babbling style.  This was Cringe Radio at its best.  We didn't know where we could hide, Anthony.  We all, you know, when Dale Earnhardt died a few months back, you saw Dale Earnhardt Jr. everywhere.  You know, everyone knows who Dale Earnhardt Jr. is, for the most part. 
[02:06:00]  And he walks up to where we're hanging, and I'm thinking to myself, holy ass, it's Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Yeah.  And, well, retarded Laverne Shirley, here we go.  Hey, who are you?  We'd like to do an interview with you.  We'd like to do an interview with you.  Hi.  We'd like to do an interview with you.  Who are you?  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Who's that?

Yeah, you know, so how you doing since, uh, are you running, uh, winning any races?  Yeah, you do.

My mother is 64.  We've got to get you a new pantsuit.  Oh, a pantsuit.  Nice pantsuit.  You don't look like him.  And she didn't know what to say.  She's like going, oh, so how have you been since, oh, can't go there. 
[02:07:00]  Um, how are you doing, uh, that whole thing with your, uh, you want any races?  And any races since you're, ooh, for God.  That's just awful.  Well, at least you have a mother.  You don't look like him.  Hey, Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, after hearing that clip, I will gladly donate the silver to Meltdown to make bullets  to have those two killed.  Yeah, I think that's all it takes.  They are comedy gold, my friend.  Oh, man, that is awesome.  Radio gold, I should say.  Later, guys.  All right.  Dale Earnhardt Jr. wished he had his, uh, car to drive away from them or over them. 
[02:07:30]  And lightning fast speed.  Or into a wall.  Oh, God.  Uh, Janet Jackson walking by, Anthony.  Hey, Janet.  Hey, Janet Jackson.  Hi.  Hey, Janet.  Hi, Janet.  All right.  Yay.  Yay.

[02:08:00]  Oh, my.  Hey, checkers.  These are some of the most riveting interviews I've heard.  Aren't they retarded?  Well, let me explain something to you.  They were not coming over to us, no matter what.  Yep.  If it was just Ann and I, they were not coming over.  They were too cool to come over and talk to anybody.  I would have come over.  I would have came over.  Who am I?  I did come over.  You did come over.  That's a matter of fact.  You did, see?  And look, and you're here today.  All right.  The Lincoln Park is pretty good.

Yeah.  She's nominated.  She's here.  Yeah.  I'm in love with her.  And you guys want best group?  Best, best, we don't want to win.  All right.  Best new artist.

Good luck.  What a concise interview.  Oh, that was probing.  Wasn't that a good interview?  They're probably the hottest rock act in the country right now.

Youse look good.  All right.  Youse look good. 
[02:10:30]  The next one is Tech from real world Hawaii, right?  Yeah, Hawaii.  And he's now a big star on MTV.  Hey, Tech.  Tech, how are you?  We're from the Open Anthony Show.  How are you doing?  All right.  So how are you doing?  The web show is Open Anthony?  Yeah, it's Open Anthony.  You know, 102.7?  Okay, all right, I know now.  Okay, okay, how are you doing?  How are you doing?  Hey, cool outfit.  What did you get in?  That's a nice outfit.  Thank you, thank you.  Very cool.  So you on the spot for reporters, huh?  I like the hair too.  Thank you.  You still have a nice outfit too.  Yo, yo, yo, that's flying, bro.  There you go, bro. 
[02:11:00]  That's so flying, buddy.  Wait, are you all going in?  No, we wish you were.  Wait, can you get us in?  No, I can't get y'all in.  Why not?  Just a ticket?  Because I don't know y'all.  Where are the parties?  Where are the parties?  I'm Lady Dawn that's married.  The parties are going to be, you have to get in there and you have to get hit on the two-way.  You got a two-way?  You got a two-way?  No, we have cell phones.  No, no, no.  Cell phones are obsolete nowadays.  No, no, no.  That's old school.  You got to get it two-way.  See, what's going to happen is, once everybody decides where the party is, they're going to  two-way each other, and then you get the two-way. 
[02:11:30]  Hey, two-way, I'm going to go one-way.  What I'm going to do is, y'all wait right here until the show is over, right?  Okay.  And then after that, I'm going to come back and let y'all know where the party is, all right?  All right.  What's your name?  My name is Diana.  Hi, y'all take it?  Tech was loving, loving them.  Yo, yo, yo, that's fly.  I called him.  She called him, bro.  I was waiting for the yin-yang parties. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, I know.  Yin-yang party, bro.  Yo, yo, that's fly, bro.  Fly, bro.  The whitest woman on the face of the earth.  Going, yo, yo, yo.  Yo, yo, yo.  Wow.  Oh, I just popped the picture up again so I could take a look with her paisley pants suit.  Yo, yo, yo.  Is that a yo, yo?  What about at the end?  She's going, yabba-dabba-doo, yo.  All right.  The next interaction, there's not much to it, but the funny part about it is Mark Wahlberg 
[02:12:30]  was right near our section, and Carrot Top was right near our section.  They wanted to talk to Carrot.  They started yelling for Carrot Top.  Jesus Christ!  Oh, God.  Yeah, you know what happened?  Mark Wahlberg.  I love the Marky.  He just reached the end of the media pit that was to our right, and he's just ready to cross  in front of our area.  Right.  So we're waiting and going, okay, this will be great.  He's going to walk right in front, Lady Diane Marion, boom, get him.  The second he starts moving, they see Carrot Top.  Oh, God.  And they start yelling, Carrot Top, Carrot Top. 
[02:13:00]  It's like Mark Wahlberg.  There he goes.  Bye-bye.  He's got a movie that comes out today.  But I saw Mark Wahlberg's face.  It looked exactly like when he first saw the gorilla walking around and riding horseback  in Planet of the Apes.  Is his movie over today?  Rockstar over today?  Yeah.  Rockstar.  I think the Daily News trashed you, and the Post gave it like three stars.  Three stars?  Well, the Times is the thing that matters.  What are the Times doing?  I don't know.  I'll have to read it.  We won't even read it.  I'm sorry.  The Times matters, but I love Mark Wahlberg.  He's incredibly talented. 
[02:13:30]  And how could they go for Carrot Top?  Carrot Top.  Over Marky Marky.  Well, let's check it out.  Where?  Open Anthony Radio Show?  Oh, right on.  Open Anthony Radio Show.  Have you been on our show?  No, I've not been on your show.  Yes, I have been on.  You know Jim Norton?  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  Right on.  And you know Jim Norton?  Yeah.  Hurry up, because NSYNC's coming.  I only have a minute.  NSYNC's on their way.  Hurry up.  Ask him something.  Who do you want to win?  How would I want to win?  I'm Destiny's Stepchild, so.  Destiny's Stepchild?  Destiny's Stepchild.  Yeah, how much time are you getting for AT&T? 
[02:14:00]  What would you like to do?  Not enough, because I'm here.  Not enough.  Yeah, but you're still here, though.  I'm here, yeah.  You're here.  We're out here.  We want to be here.  Yeah, right, right.  Anyway, you can get happy.  The only thing separating us is a piece of cloth, so really, we've gone.  I want you to get a set.  Do you have something?  All right.  And you still do Santa comedy?  Oh, absolutely.  Everywhere.  Everywhere they pay me.  I'm a whore.  I didn't tell you that.  No, I haven't done Carolines in a while, but I've played anywhere.  No, I don't play there much.  I'm on the road.  Like where?  Okay.  Like anywhere you name a city, I'm in.  What about New Jersey?  New Jersey?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you know everybody Jim Morin? 
[02:14:30]  No.  Oh, Jim Morin.  Yeah, right on.  Jim Morin.  Do you like Andrew Dice Clay?  Do you like Andrew Dice Clay?  I love Dice Clay.  Go away.  What about Jim Morin?  What about Jim Morin?  Jim Morin?  Yeah.  I love Jim Morin.  Enough of that.  All right.  Obviously not much there, but the whole time Ant and I are freaking because Mark Wahlberg's  right there.  Yeah, and they're talking to the likes of Carrot Top.  Stop talking to Carrot Top.  Try to get something going with Mark Wahlberg.  I like that Marion asked him about the AT&T commercial or the 1-800-collector, whatever 
[02:15:00]  the hell commercial he's doing.  How much money do you make for that?  Which just spells a hooah.  He said it.  If I were Carrot Top, I would not leave the house.  I know.  I wouldn't leave the house.  Just the worst hack, prop, comic.  But he's got an AT&T account.  That's good.  They like him.  America loves him.  All right.  We've got two more to get to before break-in, before we have to say goodbye to Marion.  I have to go.  I've got things to do.  I guess.  What is this, Rick? 
[02:15:30]  A whole bunch of people are walking by really fast?  People are going by pretty quick.  Nobody's stopping to talk to them, obviously.  No one's stopping at anyone, though, at this point, because now it's getting close.  And they're just...  I think NSYNC is in here, right?  They walked right by us?  They could have been around that section.  It could have been that.  Well, this clip is labeled, Various Yelling.  Hey, it's Gwen.  Bye, you guys.  Bye.  Hi, Gwen.  Hey, Stephanie.  Hey, Gwen.  Hey, Gwen.  Hey, Gwen.  How are you?  Hey, Gwen.  Look at that hair, too. 
[02:16:00]  She looked at them.  Where's Chris?  Hey, Chris.  Chris Glocken.  Christopher, what are you doing?  Hey, Jaymore loves you.  Hey, Jaymore loves you, are you?  I love Chris Glocken.  Every guy's play loves him, too.  All right, I'm drained.  Yeah.  It's the 80th time.  This is so funny.  Hey, Christopher Glocken, take my love for you.  Well, I've got a time today, boys.  Gwen did look hot, man. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you did.  I saw her last night at a party.  She looked great.  Yeah.  She looked beautiful, yeah.  Gorgeous.  And I saw Gina Gershon last night, who I went to college with.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, damn.  I went to college with her.  I did shows with her in college.  Oh, really?  And she's like, oh, we were in Boston together.  I said, we went to college together, Gina.  We were teasing each other.  I said, what are you doing?  I said, Sex in the City.  I'm doing Caroline's.  Oh, I said, you should come.  You're in New York.  You didn't come see me at Cabaret.  I'm like, I saw it once, and I don't want to see it with you.  Oh.  After seeing Natasha Richardson. 
[02:17:00]  Little Catty.  I'm not going to come see you sing Kander and Ebb.  What good is sitting alone in your room?  You know, I just got over food poisoning.  Do you know this?  You did.  I got food poisoning for two days.  I've never had food poisoning.  I won't mention.  Bad meat?  No, the restaurant was on 4th.  No.  That old guy.  You set me up way too easy today.  I know.  I apologize for the easy shot.  And that's on your end.  It was bad lobster, isn't it?  Ouch.  A restaurant called 4th. 
[02:17:30]  Well, I won't even say the name of the restaurant, but it was on 44th.  You should say.  If you know where it was at the place.  And I was with my friend Michael Hall and Amy Spanger, who's in Tick, Tick, Woman.  Michael's brilliant on Six Feet Under.  He plays David the Gay Stoner.  And he's not gay.  He's getting married to Amy.  But anyway, with them, I got the orange rubbed lobster.  Because the waiter said, get the orange or lobster.  It tasted like trick cereal, first of all.  Uh-oh.  It was like, is something orange?  No, because it was orange rubbed.  And then it was rubbed.  Then the lobster was moshy. 
[02:18:00]  And I went, and it didn't feel right.  Hold on, hold on.  Nice mouth.  That's okay, girl.  I'm sorry.  I ate it anyway.  Potty mouth.  I potty.  Bad, bad comment.  I'm like Brandon.  Bad father.  Bad father.  Well, so I ate it, and for two days, I was just really, and I haven't called them and  told them yet, but I'm going to call them and go, you know what, thanks for the orange  rubbed lobster.  Where did you rub it?  See, if you were with a few chicks, you'd know what the bad fish smells like. 
[02:18:30]  Catch your balls.  Ask Opie.  He had to drive with his hand out the window all the way from Geneseo.  Geneseo.  Oh, that, you know what.  Seven hour ride with my left hand out the window.  Then you know what?  Don't put it in.  Oh, wear some finger condoms.  What can I tell you?  You know what?  Finger condoms, clean up's a breeze.  Um, all right.  Yeah, go ahead.  Scream.  That's your own fault.  That's your own fault for liking it.  The Cartman's scream. 
[02:19:00]  Hey, guys.  Ma'am, how come you smell like me?  All right, I gotta go.  I'll be a car.  Always a pleasure.  Sunday night, 8 o'clock, I'll be there.  We're going Sunday.  Please come.  I'll be there.  You guys are going to...  Seriously.  Hell yeah.  All of you out there in television land, it was the night before Christmas, and all  through the house, discipline mixed with love is the best recipe.  Come to Caroline's, 212-757-4100.  Reservations.  Okay, I'm getting better at some horse.  The ticket's going to go fast.  You guys, thank you. 
[02:19:30]  I love you guys, and I have the best time with you.  I really do.  And Mike, it was a pleasure meeting you.  Good luck with your career.  You're a good-looking young man.  You should go far, but where's the talent?  Goodbye.  There he goes.  Mario can't tell these shows.  There you go.  Goodbye, everybody.  All right.  Take it easy, Mario.  Let's see you in the theater.  Hey, before we take a break, another clip of The Retard of Laverne Shirley as they interviewed  the big names at the VMAs last night.  Who is this that we have now?  The Bon Jovi.  Oh, you know what?  It would be great to tease this and make people wait, but it's good. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, we just have Bon Jovi and Richie Sambara walking by.  Right.  Lady Di and Marion now.  This is their music.  Huge Bon Jovi show.  They are the hugest Bon Jovi fans.  So they really had a hemorrhage.  They freaked out when they walked by.  And you could tell.  They were very excited.  All right.  Richie Sambara.  Oh, my God.  Richie Sambara.  We love you.  Richie Sambara.  Richie Sambara.  We love you.  Richie.  Oh, my God.  Richie Sambara. 
[02:20:30]  Richie Sambara.  We love you.  And a half-way there.  All living on a prayer.  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's my life.  Bye.  What are those things?  Now or never.  They need a record deal really bad.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Play it again.  Play it again.  That was so good.  You could tell they were genuinely excited. 
[02:21:00]  Play it again?  Yeah.  Just listen to the way they scream.  Oh, my God.  Richie.  We love you.  Richie Sambara.  We love you.  Richie.  We love you.  Richie.  We love you.  We love you.  Richie.  We love you.  And John.  And halfway there.  All living on a prayer.  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's my life.  It's my life.  What else do you want? 
[02:21:30]  Now or never.  Living on a prayer.  Hey.  Hey.  Halfway there.  She's yelling.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Halfway there.  Living on a prayer.  Oh, my God.  Suffering.  Fuck it.  It's John Bon Jovi.  Ah.  I'll talk to John Bon Jovi and make it look like an act of it.  He's too funny. 
[02:22:00]  Shop the rabbit.  He brought us here.  I was hoping those guys would call the show tonight.  Classic.  They lost their mind.  You heard Mary.  Oh, my God.  All right.  That's a great one.  Quick break.  We're going to finish up the clips right after commercials.  On the way, a little bit with Mick Jagger.  Not much, but it's still pretty interesting.  We've got a good story to tell with that.  Tommy Hilfiger.  Yeah.  When you hear what they said to him, you're going to fall out of your chair.  Destiny's Child.  Carson Daly.  Kelly Ripa. 
[02:22:30]  Sway.  Yes.  From MTV News, yo.  Mm-hmm, yo.  And Andrew Cuomo.  Yeah.  As we go to break, Mario, he's playing Caroline Sunday at 8.  We're all going.  A lot of us are going.  This is one of our favorite things he's done for our show.  Hey, what would Cartman sound like smoking pot?  Oh, sweet.  You guys, I am so relaxed right now. 
[02:23:00]  Can I get a cookie, please, ma'am?  Ma'am, can I get a cookie?  I want a scooter pie.  Ma'am, can I get the pancake and surprise?  Oh, sweet.  Everything looks so carnivore.  Look, you guys.  Carturic in practice.  I'm so happy.  I feel like I'm floating.

[02:25:00]  And we're back with the O&A show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  One of the highlights for me last night was when Ben introduced Fat Boy Slim to Busta Rhymes.  Yes, what a moment.  That was really, really cool when we were hanging in the downstairs bar with all the homies.  And they were smoking their blunts.  And it was getting cloudy in that room.  It was getting cloudy. 
[02:25:30]  It was getting cloudy.  Yeah.  Yin-yang party.  Yeah.  And, of course, the new style.  Oh, man.  All the hip-hop guys wearing now.  For some reason, you wear your football jersey.  Now, it might sound like everyone does this.  No.  The hip-hop guys, you've got to wear it backwards so the name is on your chest now.  We saw it last night.  I don't know.  I thought the new style was making believe you can't dribble a basketball. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  It flies off the stage.  The style is a pantsuit.  All right.  Let's get to the rest of the clips from The Retard of the Vernage, Shirley.  All right.  What are we up to now?  Well, we're up to Mick Jagger, Anthony.  Mick Jagger, of course.  Legendary singer of the Rolling Stones.  Yeah.  Needless to say.  And, well, there's not much here, unfortunately.  But Mick Jagger made his way, you know, through the red carpet. 
[02:26:30]  He wasn't talking to anyone.  And then something caught his attention.  Ben actually was yelling out that he wanted Mick to come over and talk about his new album.  Now, somebody talking about their new album, sure.  They want to do that.  They want to push it.  So he starts making his way over to the microphones.  And then he sees the retarded Laverne and Shirley and a look of horror in his face.  And then he runs off.  He's gone.  If you listen to him, he got close enough because Norton and I both shook his hand. 
[02:27:00]  And I finally got the microphone right.  And then he goes, net.  And he was on the table.  Was that before or after you told him he dropped something?  That was after.  The running gag that was going on the whole night.  Yeah.  Norton is standing right by the carpet.  And everyone that passed by, he would go, you dropped something.  And then turn his head real quick.  So they wouldn't know where it came from.  But they would all stop.  They're looking around behind him.  And then they look at the crowd of, you know, a few people that were in our compound.  And they're like, yeah, smart ass.  They got all pissed. 
[02:27:30]  But every one of them fell for it.  Drop something.  And you turn your head.  Try it out on the streets.  It works great.  It's a great gag.  There was some rapper, some whole posse.  They got the whole crew.  There was like six of them.  Yeah, yeah, looking.  They're all looking around.  You drop something.  Norton was pulling that gag on everybody.  It worked like a charm.  Once again, all the publicists having no sense of humor.  Don't know how to have fun whatsoever.  I'm surprised Jim Norton hasn't called the show to give his observations from yesterday.  But that's okay.  All right.  Here's, I think if you listen closely, you might get to hear Mick Jagger say, no way or 
[02:28:00]  something.  Hey, Mick.  Mick Jagger.  Come on, let me know.  Come here.  We want to talk to you, please.  Oh, my God.  Mick Jagger, how are you?  So nice.  We want to ask you something.  Make sure you say, yeah.  Oh, man.  Mick Jagger came over, took one look at them, and then bolted.  I just shook one of my favorite artists.  What happened?  Oh, it was so close.  It was so close.  That would have been the coolest thing ever.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, you heard them like, oh, no, no.  Well, they were like, you have you, and he just like, how are you?  How are you?  How are you?  How are you?  Shut up.  The other thing about Mick was no publicist was telling Mick what to do.  I mean, he wouldn't, you know, he was doing whatever he wanted to do, and he almost came  over.  Yeah.  That was so close, and we're like, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Oh.  Yeah, because a retarded Vernon Shirley meeting Mick Jagger moment would have just been killer. 
[02:29:00]  Anthony, this is one of my faves, the designer, Tommy Hilfiger.  He's not one of my faves.  This interview is, though.  Check it out.  How are you doing?  Tommy Hilfiger.  How are you?  How are you looking at the radio show?  I want to ask you a question.  Who do you think is going to win?  Who do you want to win that night?  I'm not sure.  Well, I'll decide after Watson perform.  I know you're a designer.  Do you think a lot of people are wearing your clothes?  I hope so.  All right.  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  No, you don't.  You get a nice suit on, Tommy.  Of course he does. 
[02:29:30]  One of the top designers ever.  I got to hear this again, because there's three things.  You think people are wearing your clothes.  Wearing your clothes?  It's Tommy Hilfiger.  Top designer.  We wear your clothes.  No, they don't.  And you have a nice suit on.  Of course he's Tommy Hilfiger.  This is worth hearing again.  Jackass.  Harry, that's how you're walking at the radio show.  I want to ask you a question.  Who do you think is going to win?  Who do you want to win tonight?  I'm not sure.  I'll decide after Watson perform. 
[02:30:00]  I know you're a designer.  Do you think a lot of people are wearing your clothes?  I hope so.  All right.  We wear your clothes.  We wear your clothes.  No, you don't.  You get a nice suit on, Tommy.  Jackass.  And they called him Tommy Hilfiger.  Tommy Hilfiger?  How are you?  How are you?  That's a nice suit.  How are you?  Tommy, how are you?  Shut the F up.  If I hear that, how are you?  One more friggin' time out of her. 
[02:30:30]  How are you?  Awful.  All right.  The next one is Jason Sehorne.  This is some good stuff.  Jason Sehorne.  Hey, Jason.  How are you?  How's your mind?  She's beautiful.  Good, good.  Hey, how's the team doing this year?  What do you think it's going to do?  How's the season so far?  Monday is the first game, so we're going to find out to get it.  All right.  What's that?  Are you going to kick ass on Denver or what?  You hope so.  I wish you luck this year.  I'm a Giants fan.  Tell Jim Fossil we said we were going to say something. 
[02:31:00]  We're Giants and Jet fans.  Oh, Mary.  We're from Jersey.  That's why.  We're from Jersey.  Hey, come back.  We were all just having fun.  Yeah, he just ran off at that point.  It was over.  We're Giants and Jet fans.  Oh, you idiots.  It's like that clip of that moment in Spinal Tap when they're playing the Air Force Base  and the guy goes, I'm a real big fan of your music. 
[02:31:30]  Well, not yours per se.  The whole genre.  Right.  All right, this is a little quick interaction with Destiny's Child.  Hey, I don't think you're ready for Destiny's Child.  Destiny, I don't think you're ready.  Hi.  Yeah, hi.  She's on some kind of drugs.  I don't think you're ready.  I don't think you're ready for Destiny's Child. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, my.  I don't think you're ready.  Oh, yes.  Oh, my.  I'm exhausted from laughing.  Too much.  It's awful.  This next clip of Montel Williams is funny.  This is when I ran to the bathroom and missed you, too.  I'm so freaking pissed at that.  But it's just really funny because she gets all belligerent after he blows her off.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, because he doesn't stop.  You know, Montel is just walking.  He's not talking to anybody. 
[02:32:30]  He should stop.  There's not much going on there.  Yeah, I know.  With his little career.  Hey, Montel, come here.  I'm going to have a couple questions.  Come here.  Come here.  Come on, Montel.  I like your, hey, I watch your talk show.  Thanks a lot for dissing me.  I'm not watching it ever again.  You retard.  See?  Thank you.  I'm over here now.  That's right.  Yeah.  Boogaloo.  I'm not watching this show ever again.  You guys got millions. 
[02:33:00]  Again, if I can go.  I hope you die of cancer.  Yeah, let me go to another movie.  That famous line.  The King of Comedy.  King of Comedy.  When Jerry Lewis is walking down the street and the woman asks if he could talk on the  pay phone with her sick son or brother or something.  And how she's a big fan.  I'm a huge fan, Jerry.  Could you just say hi on the phone?  Could you just say hi?  My brother's sick in the hospital.  Jerry, I love you.  Could you just say hi?  And he walks away and goes, no, I don't have time.  You should die of cancer.  I hope you get cancer.  She yells at him.  Yeah, let's do that again.  The first part. 
[02:33:30]  Hey, Montel, come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come here.  Come on, Montel.  I like your, hey, I watch your talk show.  Thanks a lot for dissing me.  I'm not watching it ever again.  You're talking to me.  Thank you.  I'm over here now.  That's right.  Yeah.  Boogaloo.  I'm not watching the show ever again.  I'm not watching this one.  Thanks for this one.  Just a spit factory.  I miss when Carson Daly walked by. 
[02:34:00]  This was all, I guess, when I was taking the lake, huh?  That was a watch.  He blew her up.  How much?  Hey, Carson.  Carson.  Hi, Carson.  Come on in, buddy.  Hey.  There's Norton.  Hey, Carson, his shoes.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't think we had audio of Norton playing the game.  And he got him.  And he got Carson, too.  He got him good.  Carson stopped, turned around.  He's looking around, and he made that you dick face and kept walking.  Hey, Carson.  Carson.  Hi, Carson.  Come on in, buddy.  Hey.  Hey, Carson, his shoes on tight. 
[02:34:30]  He's taking the door on tight.  Tie him.  Nice shirt.  Nice shirt.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You do this on the top.  We're almost at the end here.  Oh, our old friend, Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Kimmel.  From the Man Show, Anthony.  He was walking by with Carson, and Carson kept walking, and Jimmy Kimmel stopped for a  little while when he realized.  From the L.P. Anthony Show. 
[02:35:00]  Hey, how's everything?  How's it going?  Hey, Jimmy.  From the L.P. Anthony Show.  How you doing?  Oh, hi.  You're from the L.P. Anthony Show.  Oh, yes.  Hi.  Good.  I'm good.  I'm not good.  Hey, how you doing?  Who are you?  I'm just a fan of the retarded.  Just wanted to see.  Yeah, we're part of you.  I want to jump on a trampoline, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's it.  You know.  Sure, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  It's a good exercise.  Okay, I got to go.  I know.  It's so nice to meet you, retarded folks.  Hey, who's that? 
[02:35:30]  Jimmy Kimmel.  Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah, right after you left, you two.  Jesus, man.  I want to jump on the trampoline.  I can jump on the trampoline.  Oh, man.  Please.  First time a woman put a hole in a trampoline.  Yeesh.  All right.  And now retards on trampolines.  Hey, I'd watch that.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's when Kelly Ripa will walk by.  Kelly Ripa.  We only have a couple more. 
[02:36:00]  Hey.  How are you?  Hey, Kelly.  Hi.  How's the baby?  Hey, Kelly.  How's the baby?  What are you doing?  Hey, we're Laverna Shirley.  Come here.  We want it.  We're here for you.  We're Laverna Shirley.  Remember all being Anthony?  Yeah.  She does.  Yeah.  She does.  Hey, remember Jay Moore?  The opening at Anthony's show.  Hey, Kelly.  I like all my children.  Hey, Ben.  All right, Ben Stiller.  No.  Hey, Kelly.  Ben Stiller.  Hey, Kelly, your shoes aren't tied. 
[02:36:30]  Okay.  He doesn't have shoes on.  What?  He doesn't have shoes on.  They started seeing that Norton was getting a response with you drop something, so that  was their whole gag.  Your shoes aren't tied.  Your shoes aren't tied.  They said that to one of the hip-hop guys, and the guy's like, yo, that's the style now.  Yeah, that was the funny part was they kept trying to pull that gag, and then one of the  hip-hop guys walked past, and he did have his shoes untied.  They go, your shoes aren't tied.  You know, that's the style.  You're going to fall on a trip.  Yeah.  Jim Norton. 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Push down.  I thought he...  Oh.  Hey, Norton.  Hey, Norton.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  How's that?  That was hysterical, the, uh, you dropped something gag.  Yeah, I heard.  I didn't hear on the air.  I was just on, actually, on a computer, and somebody said that they were talking about  it.  Um, I got that from Florentine originally, and it's always funny.  Always funny.  It's never not funny.  My only regret was that we didn't do it to Mick Jagger, because what would have been  better than to just make a relic, turn around, and look for something? 
[02:37:30]  Uh, are you recuperating, or what?  Um, yeah, I didn't do much, man.  I just did a couple of spots last night, uh, afterwards, and, uh, that was it.  I didn't go in, obviously, because I had shows to do.  Well, great job.  You kept us, uh, very entertained with your gags.  Yeah, somebody told me that they were playing, uh, uh, Ron and Fez or something, and that  I was filthy.  I kept cursing, and I forgot we were being taped.  Yeah, well, the thing was, we were being taped, uh, to edit it, uh, down today, but,  um, Ron and Fez, like, popped this up a couple of times during the night, and, uh, at one 
[02:38:00]  point, I think you, you had no clue.  You were on the air.  You said, I just hope there's a shooting tonight.  I hope someone gets shot tonight.  Yeah, I remember saying that.  I think I said it to Ben.  You did.  Yeah, I was very pleased thinking about that.  Yeah, I bet.  But as they told me that, I'm running through my head.  I'm like, did I say anything really awful about somebody?  You know, or whatever.  Yeah, I know.  You start thinking, what the hell did I say?  Yeah, we all checked ourselves when we found out they were putting us up.  Oh, no.  I almost called you at 3.30 in the morning last night.  Oh.  Just to panic.  Like, you know, I hope I didn't trash somebody, like, that I shouldn't have, or, you 
[02:38:30]  know.  Yeah, no, it's all good.  All right.  You know how you panic, because I have a big mouth, and I'm a little person.  Those things never go together.  It's all good.  All right, man.  All right, man.  Have a great weekend.  We'll talk to you next week.  Okay, guys.  All right.  Thanks for everything yesterday.  No, please.  Thanks for getting me in there.  I never would have got in there on my own.  Yeah.  Cool.  Later, bud.  All right, man.  Take it to you.  Notting.  Who else is left now?  Just three.  We got Sway from MTV.  Oh, two.  Two.  Two.  Sway from MTV News.  Yeah.  This is pretty good.  Hey, who are you? 
[02:39:00]  Sway?  I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Sway, Sway, Sway.  We're from the Opie Anthony show.  Just don't call me right.  Okay.  We're from the Opie Anthony show.  Oh, we're from the Opie Anthony show.  Hey, hey, hey.  We're going to show it.  Oh, no.  Yeah, yeah.  We're in the case of the show.  Okay.  Hey, nice hat.  It's a bandana.  Original, something I created like at home.  Do you like the colors?  Yeah, I like it.  Do you like the clothing line?  Hey, that's crappy.  I like that.  Temple of Clothes.  I like your outfit.  Would you get it?  I like your outfit.  I got this on the wardrobe of MTV.  But, you know, your shoes on, sorry.  You got to check your shoes. 
[02:39:30]  No, that's the style.  Shoes.  Yeah, but you got to watch your own trip and fall.  Yeah, I kind of want to do that.  That way, you know, you'll make it on trailer if you're trip and fall.  Yeah.  Bye.  Thank you for talking.  Good luck.  Thank you for talking.  It's like, I can care less.  There's more celebrities than a view.  Thank you for talking.  All right, and finally, Andrew Cuomo.  How are you?  How are you?  How's it?  Hold on, Steve.  We got to explain who Andrew Cuomo was.  And who was he bringing in?  He was with Russell Simmons.  Okay, he was with Russell Simmons.  Right.  Andrew Cuomo, son of Mario Cuomo. 
[02:40:00]  Used to be the governor of New York.  In the state of New York, liberalized sea sucker, almost ruined the whole state.  Mr. Welfare.  Oh, sorry.  I was editorializing.  And this is his son.  Yeah, that was his son.  I'm exhausted.  Just play this.  How are you?  How's everyone?  Are you Mario Cuomo, son?  Yes, I am.  That's what they call me.  Who are you?  Nice to see you.  You're Andrew Cuomo? 
[02:40:30]  You're running for something besides the door.  I know that.  And he then ran for the door.  You know, I love those two.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's about 50 clips we just played.  From last night, after we went off the air.  Beautiful.  Some of these we might have to replay next week.  Well, we definitely need Bon Jovi. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Because when they freak out.  Save the list.  We'll play some of the highlights on Monday, in case you missed some of them.  Can we hear 17 one more time?  Which one's 17?  Which one's 17?  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, the alternate.  It's so weird.  It's all right.  It's Brian McFadden, who's now on MTV.  And he used to be Alter Boy on Station here in New York on K-Rock. 
[02:41:30]  He was a sidekick and really didn't add much to the show.  And they didn't even put his mic up that much.  Yeah.  And then he changed his name back to whatever.  To Brian McFadden.  And now everybody that watches MTV around the country knows him as Brian McFadden.  But if you're from New York, you know him as Little Alter Boy.  Right.  And we decided to just have the retarded Laverne and Shirley just refer to him as Alter Boy.  Hey, Alter Boy.  Hey, you're a tool.  How you doing?  How are you?  Good.  How you been?  Who are you?  Hey, you're a tool.  That's my radio days.  That's awesome.  Hey, you're a tool. 
[02:42:00]  Who do you want to win?  Who do I want to win?  Yeah.  Michael Jackson.  I can't do it, huh?  Michael Jackson.  I can't do it.  Thank you guys.  When are you going to have some talent?  We're going to be in the Anthony show.  It's a fight.  We're going to be in the Anthony show.  Hey, what happened to your hair?  What happened to your hair?  Hey, what happened to yours?  Nothing happened to yours.  You know what she was doing there, which is really funny?  She does this every time.  If someone insults her, she can do nothing but say the exact same thing back to the person. 
[02:42:30]  So she goes, what happened to your hair?  And he looks and he goes, what happened to your hair?  Because she's got that wacky perm.  So then she has to go again and go, well, what happened to your hair?  Like, she doesn't know what to do.  You know, there's something in there that we haven't even talked about.  Ben asked Alter Boy if he remembers getting in a fight with us.  Oh, right.  And he may believe he didn't remember, but at the Hard Rock.  He goes, oh, I love you guys.  I'm like, that's funny.  We almost got in a fight three years ago.  And he's like, oh, I don't remember that.  We all had a huge fight with them. 
[02:43:00]  Because he mouthed off.  Alter Boy and Kane.  He was walking out.  I said something to him.  I don't even remember what it is now.  Something I think is questioning his masculinity.  You called him a faggot.  I called him a faggot as he's walking out of the Hard Rock.  And he stops and turns around.  And we all started laughing.  I go, what are you going to do?  Where are you even?  Keep walking out that door.  And he did.  But I guess he didn't remember that now that he's Brian McFadden.  Blocked it out.  All right.  Hey, Toll.  Hey, Toll.  Hey, we're going to wrap up this mess next. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  With some of your phone calls, okay?  Cool.  More girls, more gooder.  Hookers for everyone.  You all got it.  Ah.  No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused.  Hey, Anthony, Sam Adams.  I want to thank Sam Adams, Anthony.  They helped us with the VMA broadcast yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  We got the retarded Laverne and Shirley liquored up on Sam Adams before they left. 
[02:44:00]  They needed a little something.  Loosen them up a little bit.  They were looking for Xanax at one point.  What's the sound of that?  That's a Sam Adams.  Yes, it is.  It's warm.  I need a cold one.  Sam Adams.  We drink it here.  We love it.  You guys want a Sam or anything?  Yeah, Mike.  Mike from the real world.  You had a little too much last night, right?  Yeah, it was out until 9 in the morning.  9 in the morning they're partying until we have such pussies, man.  We gave in at around 1.  Yeah.  But we love it, Sam.  Yeah, you can still get the summer ale, too. 
[02:44:30]  Very good.  For the Indian summer that we're not going to get.  Sam Adams.  Make it your beer.  50 seconds.  Okay.  Make it your favorite beer, too.  Five seconds left.  Eight seconds.  Sam Adams.  We love it.  Mmm.  Sam Adams.  Sam Adams.  Opie and Anthony.  Every afternoon, including Saturday afternoon.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, we're back with the O&A show.  Oh, by the way, if Angel Amy is listening, the girl that supposedly tattooed my face on 
[02:45:00]  her arm.  Yeah.  Go get a rusty razor blade and scrape that thing off now.  And then what should she do with it?  Die.  Die.  Slit her throat.  Die.  Die.  Yeah, I saw that.  Saw some pictures of it on the website.  Let me pop up the...  No one needs a fan that bad. 
[02:45:30]  Die.  It says O-N-A, but I think it means Amy.  And then there's a picture of your face tattooed on her arm.  And then it says Opie Hart Amy.  You know, like I love whatever.  So, uh, that's committed fan.  That's a committed fan right there.  Die!  I want to thank Mike from The Real World New York for stopping in today.  Thank you.  Look who's in the studio.  Ron and Fez, Anthony. 
[02:46:00]  Ron and Fez.  What's up, boys?  I saw the Amy tattoo.  Yeah.  That, you've got a number one fan there, buddy.  A number one fan.  Die.  I think there's hobbling in your future.  Yeah, great.  Die.  Mr. Man.  Mr. Man.  Mr. Man.  Oh, that's great.  We'll be going, where's Opie?  Where's Opie at?  I loved Rosie O'Donnell in that movie, man.  No, that's not a movie.  Different person.  No, it's different.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:46:30]  It's Rosie, man.  Kathy Bates.  Did you guys have fun eavesdropping on us?  Yeah, we did.  It was actually very funny hearing how many big stars would run away from Retard and Learn.  Flea.  They would flee the area.  My favorite of all was when Jagger went running away and Fezzy said on the air, wow, this  was the guy who stayed at Altamont and ran last night.  Stayed at Altamont with people who were stabbed. 
[02:47:00]  You know, I've heard them on your show many times and they stopped in here and they were  all jacked up and wanted to tell us what was going on.  They are physically intimidating.  They're scary.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Frightening.  Yeah.  Frightening.  We've got to make it perfectly clear.  What you heard today is them.  Yeah.  We didn't have to coach them.  We thought we had to.  Right.  We'll admit it.  We thought we were going to feed them some lines and, you know, get them going.  No, that was just them.  That is them.  Look at that picture.  There you go.  Isn't that a perfect picture?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go to opieandanthony.com to check out the picture.  Now, do they have tattoos, too? 
[02:47:30]  Do you make all your female fans hat up for you?  There's plenty of real estate there for a lot of tattoos.  Yeah, they could get the whole staff on their arms.  You know.  Of Infinity Broadcasting.  You know, I heard.  And some of Clear Channel.  All the card letters.  At every station across the country.  I heard Manson used to do that with his chicks, too.  So, I think it's kind of cool.  Yeah, great.  Great.  What a lunatic.  We're exhausted, so don't mind us, man.  Why don't you, you know, you're still in turkey time. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  We're on MTV time still.  Yeah, we were partying a little bit afterwards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, when you go to the VMAs and you're inside and you're hanging with all the peeps.  Yeah, I understand.  Sure.  What's it like?  Is it just great?  Is it just great?  We had burgers at the Hudson Hotel on the main floor while Puffy was having a huge blowout  party on the 24th.  On the 20th, yeah.  And we were just nobody.  We have nothing.  It's so hard to go to these things.  And here's Mike from the real world of New York.  It was a lot of fun, I'll tell you about.  It was fun. 
[02:48:30]  And who were you in a hotel room with at like 9 this morning?  Oh, Christina Aguilera.  Oh, a girl named what?  What?  Christina Aguilera?  I think we've heard of her.  It was me, Kevin, and Malik, and we were just chilling with her and her dad just playing  charades.  You know what?  Right then, the Mike Tyson rule kicks in.  If you're in a hotel room with a chick, you just F her.  She's got a boyfriend who's hella cool.  I don't care.  Here's the charade.  She's sticking his tongue in between his two fingers.  All right, guess this one. 
[02:49:00]  Smells like.  Smells like.  Wow, that's something.  How's her hair looking in real life?  Huh?  How's the hair looking in real life?  Hers?  Yeah.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Yeah.  You know, I always thought she was a skank and disgusting.  No, she's not too thin.  When she walked by on the red carpet last night, I completely changed my opinion.  Walked by or ran by?  She was one that walked by because she had enough bodyguards with her.  Yeah, okay.  Britney Spears, we think we saw her.  She walked by so fast it wasn't even funny.  Mm-hmm. 
[02:49:30]  It was just a couple of black guys, big black guys, guarding her.  And they were almost on top of her.  You couldn't even tell who it was.  It looked like a wilding scene.  Now, I turned that thing on later.  It looked like Britney was singing in the Rainforest Cafe.  I didn't know what the whole act was.  Yeah.  Rock and roll has went so Disney.  It's unbelievable.  His animal.  Yeah, the snake.  How daring.  Ooh.  I know.  No one's done that before.  I went to the striptease like two years ago, you know.  Well, she was supposed to do it with the cheetahs and they, what bunch of pussies. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, they bowed down to the PETA?  Yeah, the PETA people get in their panties in a bunch and all of a sudden no cheetahs and they bring out a snake.  Ooh, what's wrong?  What was their problem with the cheetahs coming out on a stage?  If it would have went wild and ripped her apart.  Yeah, but these are show business cheetahs.  It's not like they went and caught them in Africa and brought them.  Yeah, they're professional.  Yeah, there's two cheetahs today going, that could have been us.  I don't believe it.  Could have been us.  Look at this.  Damn it.  Now everybody knows the snake and we're nobody. 
[02:50:30]  The snake's partying with Puffy.  Can we talk to the snake, yin-yang potty?  Yin-yang potty.  There's two cheetahs standing behind Cindy Williams on the dole somewhere.  All right, we've got to say hi to the star of the show today.  Lady Di.  Lady Di.  She probably fell asleep.  All right.  God.  Surprised we didn't hear from Mary.  How are you doing?  Hey.  How are you?  How are you?  Going to the yin-yang party?  How are you?  What are you wearing? 
[02:51:00]  Oh, my God.  What are you wearing?  What are you wearing?  How scared was Bon Jovi and Richie Sandborg?  They ran.  That was the scariest of all to me.  We have just enough time to play it again.  They were petrified.  Yeah.  And they just ran away.  And, you know, it falls right into that time frame where they were probably growing up  together, yin-yang partying.  And Bon Jovi, they were huge fans of Bon Jovi.  Huge fans.  Freaked out.  Richie Sandborg.  Oh, my God.  Richie.  We love you.  Richie Sampora.  Richie.  We love you.  Richie. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, my God.  We love you.  We love you.  We love you guys.  And John.  A half-life there.  All living on a prayer.  It's my life.  It's my life.  Take it.  Take your life.  It's my life.  Bye.  I think Marion needs a hearing aid.  All right.  It's my life.  With that, we've got to get the hell out of here.  So, Ron, we've got to start this show here in New York.  And many other cities. 
[02:52:00]  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And thank you for letting us eavesdrop.  No problem.  Yeah.  Thanks to everyone.  Have a great weekend.  We'll do it all again Monday at 3, right?
