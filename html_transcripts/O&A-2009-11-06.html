<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts joking about their controversial reputation and introducing their guest lineup, including Bill Burr, Doug Stanhope, and Dr. Steve.  A significant portion focused on a viral video they'd created featuring Sharon Osbourne making highly offensive remarks about Susan Boyle's appearance. The hosts played the audio clip, highlighting Osbourne's comments.  Their producer, Mars, surprisingly hadn't been aware of the video's widespread circulation, leading to humorous banter about his limited internet use.  They also discussed other viral clips, including one of Bill Burr ranting about the Yankees.

Bill Burr then joined the show, discussing his Madison Square Garden performance, the Yankees' World Series win, and a humorous comparison between animal rescue commercials and the reality of adopting a rescue dog.  The conversation veered into childhood injury stories, often involving dogs and reckless behavior. Mars remained in the studio, participating minimally.

The show continued with graphic injury stories, including one about Opie's brother being impaled.  They previewed a segment with Doug Stanhope and Dr. Steve, who would be testing urine for diabetes, potentially including urine from Pat from Munaki and other on-air personalities.  The hosts then self-deprecatingly discussed their lack of medical expertise.

Bill Burr's viral YouTube video about the Yankees was played, leading to a lengthy discussion about baseball finances and team competitiveness.  Doug Stanhope joined the conversation, offering his perspective as a non-Yankees fan.  The discussion included tangents on hockey, focusing on fighting and featuring anecdotes about Ty Domi, and a mention of Brock Lesnar's illness.  They played a dashcam audio clip of a police officer instructing a non-compliant driver, followed by a brief audio clip of Ron Howard's laughter.

A police audio clip of a tasing incident led to a discussion about police practices and excessive force.  A New Jersey police sergeant, Sean, called in, offering a law enforcement perspective.  Bill Burr recounted a humorous traffic stop experience in Colorado.  Doug Stanhope, who was in studio, revealed a large umbilical hernia, leading to a scheduled examination by Dr. Steve.

The show then devolved into internal office conflict, focusing heavily on criticism of intern Evan.  Anthony's recent hospital visit with a younger woman was mentioned, followed by numerous "F.U." messages from listeners.  Evan's work ethic, Adderall use, and sleeping habits were extensively discussed, with other interns like Paul, Matt, Doug, Graham, and Nick participating in the heated exchange.  The discussion included personal insults and boasts.  A significant portion recounted the life and death of a former intern, Tippy Tom. A penny stock promotional segment featuring pennystockchaser.com was aired, along with an AC/DC box set giveaway.

A urine-tasting contest to identify a diabetic among Big A, Pat from Munaki, and two controlled diabetics then took place.  The humor focused on the gross-out nature, participants' reactions, and the hosts' and guests' commentary.  The segment included discussions about a testicle flying out during masturbation, Big A's appearance, legal restrictions on content (including a rejected idea involving beer and "titty dancers" for the homeless), Michio Kaku, a brief Yoko Ono song, and the difficulties of getting bits approved by the network's legal department.  Pat received an AC/DC box set.  The show concluded without resolving the conflict between Evan and Paul.  Dr. Steve's past prostate examinations of guests were also mentioned throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be an Anthony, are no strangers to scandal.  We'll be an Anthony on satellite radio.  Host Anthony Camilla and Greg.  We'll be an Anthony apologizing for yet another raunchy gag.  We'll be an Anthony show.  We'll be an Anthony.  Is this the last straw for the raunchy radio duo?  For the raunchy radio duo?  Disturbed and deviant.  There's nothing I enjoy more than drunken teen girls.  It's a history of misogynistic behavior. 
[00:00:30]  The home of incest and anal sex.  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.  I am a fucking lunatic.  It's shocking.  I love it.  What a freak show.  What a Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey freak show.  The best of our abilities.  We'll try really hard every day.  What are we going to do?  The best of our abilities are a good show.  This is what the show is.  Silly, stupid, whatever you want to call it.  Listen to it and like it or don't.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the roll. 
[00:01:00]  Holy shit.  I just turned on the mic and went, I got to do this.  It all looked good on paper, but now I got to do this.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and whoever we can find at the last minute radio show.  What do we got?  We got me, me and you, the listener.  No, don't Spectro Michigan, dummy.  Good morning, boys. 
[00:01:30]  No, good morning, Opie.  Good morning, Opie.  The one true workhorse of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  The only guy in radio that has to guess who he's doing the radio show with the next morning.  And it's out, I guess.  Yeah.  And Bill Burr's coming in at, what, 7?  All right.  Don't stand hope at 7.30?  Yep. 
[00:02:00]  All right.  Dr. Steve at 8?  Yeah.  Dr. Steve.  Doing some medical thing?  Hell yeah.  All right.  So what do we do between now and 7?  He waits.  I just sit here and wait?  Yeah.  Turn off the music.  Yeah, you want some girl from Ipanema or something?  John G. goes, why don't you just talk local news?  Now, we can talk about, well, yesterday was a huge day for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  Our Susan Boyle video, well, actually, it's the Sharon Osbourne video, but she's trashing Susan Boyle,  has pretty much gone worldwide.  That's true.  No thanks to Sirius XM Satellite Radio, by the way.  They get hit with a newspaper.  We have what?  We do have a PR department, a marketing department here, right?  We have a publicist, yeah, a Sirius publicist.  Yeah.  And they, I guess they didn't feel like a video clip or audio clip of Sharon Osbourne trashing Susan Boyle, 
[00:03:00]  who the world loves, would be interesting for anyone out there.  Maybe they didn't hear it.  So, uh, so we, me and Sam and a few of the other guys, we decided to push it out there.  Yeah.  Because we, we, I guess we run marketing here at Sirius XM.  And the damn thing is everywhere.  Everywhere. 
[00:03:30]  Every popular, it's on Perez Hilton, it's on Access Hollywood, it's on, uh, Gawker, it's on Breitbart,  what would Tyler Durden do, Pop Eater.  Pop Eater isn't a big site, right?  Yeah, but it feeds in.  Like, Us Weekly picked it up off Pop Eater.  Yeah.  I got a sister, she doesn't, I don't think she really knows what I do for a living,  until I hit people.com.  Oh my God.  I'm like, yeah, I do this every day, and every once in a while, we'll hit on something that goes worldwide.  Yeah, that's me. 
[00:04:00]  She goes, oh, I didn't realize how popular you were.  They're going crazy in the UK for it.  Crazy in the UK?  I'm losing a major war on my YouTube channel.  Oh, yeah.  I got Susan Boyle fans just beating the shit out of me, beating the shit out of Sharon Osbourne,  Jim Norton, Anthony.  We forgot she was England's sweetheart, and the Mirror picked it up, and the Sun picked it up,  and a whole bunch of New Zealand and Irish papers picked it up.  Right.  And so all the European people are just pissed off.  Yeah, they're really, really mad. 
[00:04:30]  I like the quote here that shows up in Google, if you put it in Google News.  Yeah, what?  It's just, in quotations and big font, I like everybody to do well, even somebody that looks  like a slapped ass.  God bless her.  It's like, you go, girl.  She does look like a hairy asshole, the Mirror quoted her saying.  I think she said arse.  Arse.  Arse.  Yeah, but, uh...  Yeah, it's big news.  It's worldwide news.  Even the New Zealand Herald picked up on it.  What the fuck is the New Zealand Herald saying?  New Zealand's finest news publication. 
[00:05:00]  Is it?  I think so.  And then the New York Post picked it up, but, you know, why were they mentioning the  show's name?  Perez held into the same thing, no mention.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, we joke about that, but it happens all the time.  You know, we push something out there, and then they don't acknowledge where it came  from.  Thank God the mic flags are in the video, so everyone knows where Sharon Osbourne said  all these awful things about Susan Boyle.  So, just stating the obvious, it's about time someone, very famous, just spoke their 
[00:05:30]  mind.  And it's just silliness, too.  Susan Boyle is a fucking ugly broad.  Yes, it's true.  What are we supposed to do?  And the fact is, if she wasn't so ugly, she wouldn't be so famous.  Right.  There's a lot of women that have really nice voices, but it was a thing, because she was  so ugly.  She's got a great voice for an ugly woman.  Yeah, absolutely.  So, that's very exciting.  You can go to my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, to check it out, but I mean... 
[00:06:00]  Everyone else is.  Actually, it's everywhere, though.  I mean, you'll see it if you check an entertainment site.  Access Hollywood, huh?  Access Hollywood put it up overnight.  That means we might get a little TV out of it today.  That's right.  Access Hollywood, if you're listening, contact us.  We'll give you TV quality video.  That's smart.  That's smart, Sam.  Yeah, so...  We haven't been in the news in a while, so it's kind of exciting.  We should play the rant, actually.  That'll kill a few minutes before Bill Burr gets here.  No offense, Sam.  I like doing a little radio with you.  No, it's okay.  Maybe we should invite Mars up to the big table. 
[00:06:30]  Mars is good.  Mars, you got anything on all the excitement?  I mean, there's a little buzz in the air about the Opie and Anthony show today.  What do you got on that?  Sit down.  Make yourself comfortable.  I didn't tell you to sit down.  You better sit, though, because you're a nervous wreck.  Yes, I am.  All right.  What do you got on the whole Susan Boyle being trashed by Sharon Osbourne?  You know, to tell you the truth, this is all news to me.  I didn't know this was happening overnight. 
[00:07:00]  What do you mean you didn't know?  I had no idea.  What radio show do you work for?  The O&A show.  So don't you just check basic things on the Internet?  Absolutely.  Maybe throw Opie and Anthony in Google every once in a while.  There's like 40 news articles on Google News.  Maybe check my Twitter every once in a while or my YouTube channel.  Today's the one day that I didn't do that.  Or Danny's Facebook.  Whatever it takes.  Danny's Facebook.  I checked out Danny's Facebook yesterday.  I had to ask him why he was so...  What did you say?  I'm fucking...  I was annoyed.  Yeah.  He just writes, I'm annoyed. 
[00:07:30]  So we had a whole Facebook discussion because I was annoyed by the fact that Danny just  wrote, I'm annoyed.  And without elaborating?  Yeah.  That's what bothers the shit out of me about Facebook and Twitter.  Tell me why you're annoyed.  When people visit me at Facebook.com slash HelloExactly, they could follow all of my  exploits and then maybe they could put the puzzle pieces together and figure it out for  themselves.  Yeah.  Oh, so we have to go back to your past statuses to say, oh, what did you do?  Because then I figure I might have...  I'm thinking I might have a little bit of a relationship with Danny, so it's just me 
[00:08:00]  and him before the show.  I go, all right, why are you annoyed?  I saw it on Facebook.  Oh, I'm just annoyed.  About a lot of things.  And I'm like, this doesn't help me.  The reason why I'm annoyed.  Just in general, he wakes up annoyed.  Right.  Well, you know, I don't want to start getting into like, you know, like personal, private,  bad, like first thing in the morning.  Not like I wouldn't get into that with you per se, but it's just like, is that what you  want to hear first thing in the morning?  You already pushed it out there, though.  You know what I mean?  Well, it's such a vague concept.  You know, a lot of times I'm annoyed.  I just don't write it on Twitter like that. 
[00:08:30]  If you don't want people to ask why you're annoyed, you shouldn't tell anybody you're  annoyed.  Well, I wasn't expecting it from the OPS.  Like, if it was like, at OP Radio, I'm annoyed.  Then I would expect it.  Let me show you the difference.  Go to my Twitter.  I haven't really mentioned it on our show yet, but when I'm annoyed, I kind of give you  a little more than I'm annoyed.  Find the tweet about the dude from Ron and Fez.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, let's see. 
[00:09:00]  No, no, go down.  Meaning the other way, sorry.  Oh, back to the time.  I know, I know.  Here's the, uh, dating montage, no.  Below that, me commenting that I saw a black hockey player, no.  Keep going.  No, the other way, the other way.  Keep going, keep going.  But now I'm going back up again.  I know, that's what I meant.  I don't understand this.  I know, just keep going.  Keep going, I like this.  He's, okay.  Wow, I tweet a lot. 
[00:09:30]  Jesus Christ.  You got a lot to say.  But now we're back to the top.  Oh, no.  It was supposed to go the other way.  Yeah, you got to go down.  I got so confused, it looked like it was going the right way.  All right, go back.  I know which way I'm going.  It was the right way to be going.  It was two days ago.  It was two days ago.  Uh, uh, fuck the replay, no.  Uh, thanks for the props on Warren Haynes.  Yeah, we have to go to the next page.  There's got to be more.  God damn, do I tweet a lot.  I'm sorry if you follow me.  Uh, maybe just say.  The more watch, the funnier it gets.  Where the fuck is this?  That's Shackler. 
[00:10:00]  Uh.  I don't know.  No, it's before it is.  Do you know?  I don't know.  There's too many tweets here.  What about that one?  It just says, ugh.  Yeah.  All right, it's newer than that.  Keep going up.  It's newer than the Osborne.  It's been Jody Sweetin?  Yeah, it's newer than that.  There it is.  Found it.  All right, yeah.  So you write, I'm annoyed, and it keeps everybody wondering.  I wrote on Twitter two days ago, who the fuck is this piece of shit trashing E-Rock on Rana Fez? 
[00:10:30]  You're a stupid motherfucker.  There's not, uh, too many ways to misread that one.  It shows I'm annoyed, and it also gave Rana Fez a little extra traffic.  Yeah.  A few extra listeners, because then they immediately had to check out Rana Fez to hear some intern,  I guess, trashing E-Rock.  Yeah, Scotty Too Hot, he really made an asshole of himself.  Yeah, he asked for a picture with me, and he has some real hot, like, old girlfriend he  hangs out with or something.  Yeah, that's the girlfriend that he walks, or the ex-girlfriend that he walks around with 
[00:11:00]  so people don't think he's gay.  Right, the beard.  Oh, really?  Mars called her a beard, I don't know.  He was really nice, and he's a fan of our show and stuff.  Because he's a phony.  And then, literally three days later, he's, like, trashing E-Rock.  Yeah, because he's a phony.  He was just nice to you.  See, we can all beat each other up, but you can't...  Of course not.  You can't just roll up in here and start beating people up.  No, man.  It's that whole Irish Brothers thing.  Yeah.  Right.  Irish Brothers will beat the shit out of each other, but, man, you try to, you know,  you mess with one of the brothers, it's going to be hell to pay. 
[00:11:30]  And it was.  All right, where are we?  So, Mars, you didn't even know?  No, I did not.  No.  I had no idea.  I had no exposure today.  And this is new.  Man, this is great stuff, man.  This is great.  This is good news.  This is real good news.  You're, like, in the epicenter of the O&A world.  Dude, the one day...  There are people that live in Iowa that know about this shit.  The one...  In New Zealand.  In New Zealand.  The one day I didn't even check.  You're four feet away from me.  You don't know about this. 
[00:12:00]  Well, look at how it is.  There's people in other countries that are tweeting about it.  But check this out.  I come to work and I find this out.  Man, this is really exciting.  Loving it.  Loving it.  No, you just found out live on the air.  Right.  And I'm part of it.  You know, I'm part of the show.  No, you're part of the audience.  You're basically not on the inside, on the outside.  I was here when it happened.  Were you?  I would consider you a casual listener.  Yes.  The hardcore listeners know.  Yeah.  They found out last night.  Yeah.  So, all right.  He listens when he can. 
[00:12:30]  I'm so glad we worked so hard here, Mars.  What the fuck is it going to take?  You realize you work for a really popular radio show, right?  Absolutely.  Yes, I do.  He didn't know because he didn't realize there were people talking.  Now he knows.  There's a buzz.  And for the record, everybody, I am no longer annoyed.  I am now awesome.  Oh.  But why are you awesome?  Because I got to plug my Facebook.  And I give you a little plug because it says here, if you go to facebook.com slash hello 
[00:13:00]  exactly, it says Danny Ross is awesome.  Thanks for the plug.  Twitter.com slash OB Radio.  I love how we all have just handles now.  All right.  Want to play the Susan Boyle audio?  Yo, this is going to be big all day long, man.  All weekend.  It's Friday.  All weekend.  You think?  Yeah.  I mean, the O&A community, we're all over it, but now it's going to spread from here.  And it's going to be a big day.  You're going to hear this audio in a lot of places today.  Mars, are you a spy for Bubba?  That's coming in.  John G. from Lexington.  I think Mars does listen to Bubba in the afternoon. 
[00:13:30]  Who the fuck is Bubba?  Oh, shit.  Those are fighting words.  Watch out.  Bubba wants to fight everybody.  Watch out.  Watch out for Bubba.  He's friends with Hulk Hogan.  Oh, is he great?  Watch out for the hillbilly.  He wants to fight everyone, Mars.  Uh-huh.  Never seen him punch anybody, though.  Uh-huh.  Oh, but he'll tell you how much he wants to fight everybody.  Uh-huh.  Mars, you can elaborate a little bit.  The uh-huhs don't.  I don't know. 
[00:14:00]  I've seen the guy, so I don't know.  He's a big, fat mess of a man.  But he's got a cage in his radios.  Does he have a cage?  Who can't control himself at a buffet.  Come on.  The guy's right in the office back there.  Is he?  Bring him in.  Bring him in.  Oh, Bubba.  Oh.  Oh, Danny was making an E-Rock.  No, actually.  No, actually.  What is an E-Rock?  I know.  I know.  It was Steve C.  Steve.  I get it.  All right.  So this is audio.  Huffington Post has your great Sharon Osbourne video clip on their website, too. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, Huffington Post.  Yeah, it's everywhere.  And maybe we could get a few troops on my YouTube channel, because the Susan Boyle fans  are just getting the best of me right now.  Yeah, you've got to let these...  Actually, getting the best of Sharon Osbourne.  Really just attacking her bad.  Let the Susan Boyle fans know what it is.  Right.  Well, she just spoke her mind.  It was refreshing.  All right.  Here's the clip.  The video's up on OP Radio on YouTube, but check it out.  It's a...  What is it?  Like two, three minutes?  Two minutes.  All right.  Here we go.  Hit it. 
[00:15:00]  This great picture of Susan Boyle smiling, looking like a slapped ass, right next to  the Aussie.  A slapped ass.  Yeah, that really is a great shot.  What a great line.  That's a great line.  Oh, man.  So, do you love Susan Boyle?  I mean, do you feel like she helped the show or not, or do you not love her?  Are you happy that she's succeeding?  Oh, I'm happy that she...  I like everybody to do well, and even someone that looks like a slapped ass with a mustache.  It's like, God bless her. 
[00:15:30]  What's that?  You go, girl.  She does look like a hairy arsehole.  I don't know why they try to clean her up.  I mean...  No.  Keep her how she was.  Wow, it's fantastic.  It's kind of hard to spin that.  What did you mean when you said she was a hairy arsehole face?  Well, it was a spiritual comment.  I didn't mean it to be taken in a bad way.  No, and she is a lovely...  I would hope so.  Followed by God bless her heart.  God bless her heart.  No, you do. 
[00:16:00]  You just want to say, God bless, and here's a Gillette razor.  I never noticed that she had facial hair.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't get past the slowest.  I couldn't get past the fucking Gene Wilder wig.  God bless her heart.  God bless her.  But we love her.  All that talent doesn't come without a price.  Wow.  God doesn't give everyone everything. 
[00:16:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah, absolutely.  He gave her the talent.  He certainly did.  Yes, he did.  Really short-changing on the rest of it.  He hit her with a fucking ugly stick.  He certainly did.  Holy Jesus.  Why are you holding back?  I don't want to say, seriously, man.  Sharon, I need you to open up.  You've got to open up a little bit.  He gave Tiger Woods the ugly stick.  Could you knock this bitch around for a few hours?  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  It's not going to get better than that.  Wow, that is very refreshing. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, God, absolutely.  Oh, there you go.  And the video, like I said, everywhere.  Fucking everywhere.  Jesus Christ.  I just got a Google alert.  It's on a website called thecelebritycafe.com now.  It's on the Superficial.  It was on every blog.  The D-Lister.  Yep, D-Listed.  D-Listed?  Yeah.  All right.  Phil in Orlando.  Phil.  Hey, I was just thinking,  with the show being a little short-handed today, 
[00:17:30]  probably could use a good punchline, huh?  Oh, shit.  See, it's going to be tough to keep the energy going  until, like, Bill and the rest of the gang gets here.  Can you imagine if we brought the virus in right now  and just sat and waited 10 minutes for one lousy punchline?  Oh, you're killing me, Phil.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks a lot.  All right, let's go to AJ in Chicago.  AJ.  Hey, Hope.  Hey, uh, can I get a babysitter today?  I don't know what the deal is.  Maybe I'll find out more later today. 
[00:18:00]  All right, man.  You have a good one.  All right.  I found out when I was at the Dane Cook show  because I texted Ant to say,  is everything all right?  Are you coming in tomorrow?  And then that's when he said,  well, probably not.  I'm like, oh, okay.  Well, it is 930 at night,  and it would be nice to know this a little sooner.  Uh-huh.  But we figured it out.  We'll do a show.  Was Dane Cook's thing good?  Dane Cook's show was real good.  Absolutely.  Bill Burr and Robert Kelly killed.  And Gary Goleman killed. 
[00:18:30]  And then Michael Epps.  I'm not sure if he killed.  You can't tell?  I don't know.  That's what we were discussing.  Like, he had a lot of energy,  and people were loving him.  And now he's a movie star because of Hangover.  So when they introduced him,  the place went just nuts.  Just like it was a prize fighter going to the stage.  He went nuts.  I guess he killed Ben.  I don't know.  He's one of those black comics that has just a lot of energy.  So you're not really sure.  Right. 
[00:19:00]  You don't know exactly.  He was definitely funny.  He just wasn't my favorite up there.  I mean, Bill Burr and Robert Kelly.  Of course.  Not that I'm playing favorites,  but they both had amazing sets.  And Dane, you know, was great as usual.  So it was a good night.  Did you have better seats than E-Rock?  E-Rock Twittered,  and he seemed to have very good seats.  E-Rock had better seats than me.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Why?  How'd that happen?  Why is your voice so high?  That's because it's unbelievable for me.  No, I mean, we both had really good seats. 
[00:19:30]  I was in, like, the second row,  and E-Rock was in the...  E-Rock was, like, first row...  Yeah, there you go.  Right on the corner.  He had really good seats.  That's not right.  So just amazing to see those guys do stand-up  at Madison Square Garden.  I'm like, how the fuck do you do that?  Because you don't know where to look or nothing.  Because it's in the round.  How long was Dane on for?  Over an hour, easily.  Wow.  Then did an encore,  and then got some awards,  and, yeah, it was a good night.  It was a very good night.  Speaking of Bill Burr, 
[00:20:00]  his Yankee rant is worth replanting today as well.  That's another one that's on a bunch of websites.  Fuck yeah.  Who picked that up?  Fark?  I think Fark.  I think Breitbart.  There's some comedy websites that picked it up,  some sports websites that picked it up.  Right.  And we threw that on my YouTube channel as well,  OB Radio.  You can see the Bill Burr.  Well, you can't really see it.  We just threw a couple pictures up there.  That's an audio clip.  But Bill Burr just went off on the Yankees winning the World Series.  And, of course, there's a lot of excitement here in New York 
[00:20:30]  because the parade is at 11 o'clock downtown.  Mar, is you excited about the parade?  A battery place.  Mars just knew that because he looked at the TV behind you.  He had no idea.  He just saw it on the TV.  It said battery place.  I'm using my motherfucking resources, Sam.  Holy shit.  My motherfucking resources.  You're so quiet.  You got a mic in front of you.  Use it.  Do you understand?  I need help right now, you fucker.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I thought I just finished saying something to Sam 
[00:21:00]  in reference to using my resources.  My motherfucking resources.  No, you lucked out.  We have eight TVs and it said Battery Park or whatever on the screen.  And you went, Battery Park.  You didn't say anything about it.  What else do you know about the parade today?  What can you tell us about the parade, the canyon of heroes?  Stop looking at the TV.  Yeah.  What?  Give us a little something on the parade here in New York City.  It's held down in the Wall Street area.  You know, that's all I really know about it.  It's during the good part of the working day. 
[00:21:30]  He just said it was at 11.  Okay.  So that's...  You said battery place a minute ago.  I really don't know much about it.  No.  No.  No.  What?  You don't know much about much, huh?  No, I don't.  No.  We'll make sure we stay on topics that I don't know about.  Right, Sam?  What?  You're sweating.  I'm not.  You're an MMA fighter.  I'm not sweating.  Just imagine that you're fucking doing some MMA shit.  You know what the deal is?  You've got to watch what you say.  You've got to watch every word.  You've got to be careful if it doesn't come back or it gets twisted by... 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, because the Yankee parade is such a controversial topic.  No, that's not the topic.  Are you excited the Yankees won?  Absolutely.  I'm a Yankee fan.  Name the lineup.  The lineup.  Yeah.  I know certain players.  I'm not even a Yankee fan, but I could name the lineup.  Name the lineup.  Like the first hitter, second hitter, third hitter?  No.  No, that's the basics of liking a team.  Yeah, well, I don't...  How many players can you name? 
[00:22:30]  Jeter.  A-Rod.  Oh.  Matsui.  Okay, that's good.  I could name those.  I don't even know how baseball was played.  Sam hates baseball, and he could name those.  We should have the Sam baseball quiz.  No shit.  Because we did this with the football.  No shit.  But I think that it would be just as horrific with baseball.  Sam is horrific when it comes to real sports.  Last Saturday, we were broadcasting...  Why are you...  Wait.  Hold your thought.  You're getting in time.  I wanted to direct...  You got three so far.  Let's try to get ten. 
[00:23:00]  Ten.  You're a fan!  You know, but I can't name the players.  I'm a sort of Mets fan.  Okay.  I...  And I can name ten Yankees.  Girardi's the manager of...  Who?  Girardi.  No.  Okay, let me try to think.  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  I'm...  A-Rod, their third and shortstop.  Second.  Who's on second?  First.  I...  I don't...  I don't know.  You named the three most popular players on the team.  Didn't I? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Matt Sui won the fucking MVP.  But Posada, the catcher...  Thank God Bill Burr is here to save the day.  Thank fucking God.  You have no idea what I've been dealing with.  I literally woke up out of a sleep picturing you in here flailing, going,  How many times can I...  Can I play these stupid things?  Because I...  Because I...  I...  We all wrote Bill, and Bill's like, ah...  I can maybe make it at seven.  But you know that I'm...  I need help.  I know you need help.  So here you are at 6.30.  Here I am.  Like a true fucking friend. 
[00:24:00]  We're trying to get this fucking asshole right here.  Right.  Who's an MMA fighter, so let's watch out for him.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because me and Bill have anger issues, but we're not stupid.  Okay.  Right?  You're not stupid with your anger.  Mixed martial arts.  Right.  That's the way to go.  But I'm...  He's a Yankee fan, so I go, name...  Name the lineup.  He goes, ah...  So now we're down to just name ten fucking Yankee players.  He named the three most popular as a Yankee fan.  Dirk Jeter, A-Rod, and Matt Sui.  Uh-huh.  And he went Girardi.  All right.  Who's not...  Who doesn't play. 
[00:24:30]  It's a bitch, and the Yankees don't wear their names in the back of their shirts.  He's the...  Stop it.  That's because you're supposed to know who they are.  No, that's why they do it.  Like, even when they go on the road, they don't have a name.  Like, I always like that.  That...  Right.  That swagger.  It's like, you know who we are.  Of course.  Well...  Uh...  I'm a failure on that.  I...  I...  I...  I can't name the players.  Let's, uh...  How about one...  Like, a couple more?  The old-timers, man.  Everybody that I know...  No.  Okay.  Name some old guys.  Uh... 
[00:25:00]  Bernie Williams.  Uh...  I could go back...  I could go back to Munson.  You know...  Uh...  Name one pitcher on the Yankees.  Uh...  Pettit.  He's the one that won.  Yes.  Okay.  Uh...  Who else?  Uh...  Give us one more.  Being a Yankee fan and all, of course.  Russell Johnson.  There you go.  Russell Johnson.  Thank you, Bill.  Let me say hi to...  Let me say hi to John in Fresno.  John, how are you?  Good evening. 
[00:25:30]  Hey.  Hey, Bill.  You are a funny son of a bitch.  Thank you.  I gotta say that I've seen your stand-up myself.  Thank you.  Hey, uh...  Opie.  You gotta...  You gotta send Mars back to the engineering room.  He...  You fucking suck.  This show's coming to a halt.  He didn't even name all the players that are on the newspaper that was sitting in front  of him.  Yeah, it was just...  It was right here.  He didn't name all three of these people.  Mars, they don't like you on the show.  That's fine.  You like me.  You're a blithering idiot.  I don't like him in real life. 
[00:26:00]  That's not true, Danny.  You know you love me.  Danny loves me.  All right.  Thank you, Mars.  All right.  Hey, did you think...  That means leave.  Okay.  That means leave.  Hit the brakes.  You want Mars to hang out, Bill?  It's me and you today, so you make decisions.  Whatever.  You want to stick around?  Yeah, I want to stick around.  All right.  Let him just sit down.  That's right.  He's very...  Why do I gotta be so nice?  Beat it.  He's very quiet, so he won't be a bother.  What were you asking?  Did you...  You made it out last night?  Dude, I was the fucking guy. 
[00:26:30]  I went, nice job, Bill.  And you turned.  I went, thank you.  Oh, I...  Did you hear that guy?  That's what happened to me with that Chef Chris down in D.C.  Yeah.  Same thing.  No, Bill Burr had a great set.  I was just complimenting you.  You had a great set of Masters of Square Garden.  You walked right by me and my wife as you're leaving the stage.  Oh, yeah.  Those guys had like the flashlights.  Yeah, yeah.  Like pointed back to you.  And I leaned in and I went, nice job, Bill.  And you turned.  I knew you didn't know who I was because it's dark and stuff.  And you went, thank you.  You should have...  You suck.  Bring on Dane.  That's what you should...  Dude, you're... 
[00:27:00]  Then I would have looked.  You're fucking...  Now I want to talk about it because I talked in general.  Your set was amazing.  Robert Kelly was amazing.  Gary Goldman had a really good set.  And then...  Bobby's got a ton of new shit, man.  Bobby fucking did real well, man.  And Mike Epps, not sure.  Like he had the crowd going.  A lot of energy.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure about him.  And he walked in like a rock star, man, because of Hangover and everything.  Was he in Hangover?  Yeah, he was in Hangover.  Oh, I don't know.  So, I'm not saying he was bad, but he was just... 
[00:27:30]  I don't know.  Am I getting myself in trouble?  No, you're going to get me in trouble, though, because you're going to start trying to...  I'm not saying he was bad.  He had so much energy.  Like, I was like...  I was on the edge of my seat listening to you and Bobby, really into what you guys were saying.  He...  It was more of a...  It was just an energy.  Oh, I don't know.  I got to be honest with you.  It's hard to explain.  My room is like nine miles away.  Oh, no.  You guys don't...  Like, when they intro you.  But, I mean, as far as I know, Mike Epps is hilarious.  Yeah.  You know what? 
[00:28:00]  I'm not really making my point well, so...  But I want to get to you.  The freaking Sarah McLachlan dog shit you were doing?  Oh, yeah.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, I get a lot of complaints about that.  But it comes full circle, because I didn't get a chance to go in as I end up rescuing a pit bull.  So, then I usually end up being able to beat out, you know, because they rescued a chihuahua.  Right, right.  Like, that takes balls.  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  That's like, I rescued a pit bull, dude.  I took it to the nth degree.  Anything beyond a pit bull, I might as well rescue a fucking alligator. 
[00:28:30]  It's some of the stuff you've talked about on the show, though, how, like, you know,  some of us go down to shelters to get our dogs, and you explain it brilliantly.  You don't know what's wrong with this dog and what problem it has as you bring it into your home.  No clue.  And you don't know what that one thing is going to be that sets off the dog.  And they just give you the dog.  There's no background check.  They don't tell you, like, don't fucking use a flashlight ever or whatever.  And they got a thing where they love animals so much that they want to, first of all, the  big thing down there is they'll never tell you it's a pit bull. 
[00:29:00]  They'll tell you it's a mix.  Right.  It's a mix.  That was what they said to my girl when we got our dog.  Because I was looking at her on Skype.  I go, you got a pit bull?  She goes, no, it's a mix.  I'm like, mix with what?  Another pit bull?  It's been doing pull-ups since they came out of the womb.  It's been shredding.  It's like Ivan Pusky.  It's like shredded, right?  So I was down there when we were in the middle of our battle there because I wanted to get  a brand new dog and she wanted to go get the rescue one.  And I went down there to look at this dog. 
[00:29:30]  This dog was a beautiful dog, but the dog was looking like, I like bigger dogs, so this  dog is looking right through the back of my head like it knows something about me.  And the lady's like, oh, it's such a beautiful dog, blah, blah, blah.  But the thing's got this look on its face.  So I finally say to the woman, I go, what's up with this dog?  What's up with the dog?  She goes, oh, he was chained to a pallet in a junkyard his entire life.  And I go, does he have any issues?  She goes, he's a little aggressive.  And it's like, well, were you going to tell me that shit?  Right. 
[00:30:00]  Or were you just going to let me drive home as that thing's sitting in the...  That's the thing is you're driving home with the dog.  And you just don't know what's going to make the thing snap.  It's a brilliant observation.  Well, my dog, but I've got to tell you, though, man, that it shouldn't make you not go out  and rescue a dog, but they also, you know, the truth is somewhere in the middle and the  over-the-top ridiculousness of my bit.  Somewhere in the middle of like the commercial, because I didn't really, because I only didn't  have too much time, but I didn't really get into it.  But when you look, the commercial is casted like a reality show. 
[00:30:30]  They have the cutest, fuzzy little, I just want to play Frisbee looking dogs.  There's no pit bulls.  There's no Rottweilers.  There's none of them with like battery acid burns.  Right, right.  You know.  They're just beat up enough.  Yeah.  To keep you watching.  Yeah.  Cute little fuzzy ones.  I mean, I don't even know how many people were at the Garden yesterday.  It was fucking packed.  Right.  It was ridiculous.  And the reaction you got was amazing.  And it's vicious material, but fucking you were getting major fucking laughs.  And I was like, it was good to see, because Dane's audience is not as edgy as probably 
[00:31:00]  your typical audience.  Jaded, I would say.  No, yeah.  I was thinking to myself, wow, are they going to, is a Dane Cook audience going to enjoy  Bill Burr's material?  And the answer today is absolutely.  They loved it.  Well, he actually told me something that was brilliant.  Like, I go, man, dude, how the fuck do you do this with people behind you, in front of  you, all the way around?  And he just goes, dude, he goes, it's four theaters.  It's like, there's a theater in front of you.  There's a theater in the right, left, in the back.  And once he said that, it became, and then also with it in the middle of the whole arena, 
[00:31:30]  it becomes oddly, like, intimate.  It doesn't feel like, they sort of broke it down backstage, like Barry Katz was talking  about when you go to a rock show, how they put the stage all at one side.  So now the last row is 200 yards away.  So if you put it in the middle, the furthest seat is like half that now.  Sure.  So they're all right there.  They're all right there.  And you had a real moment.  You got up there and you went, you start looking around and you went, how the fuck do you  do this shit?  Or something like that.  Yeah, I didn't know which way to stand. 
[00:32:00]  Because all of a sudden Bill's just turning around, like, trying to find his spot on the  stage.  It's like, no, you're not going to find his spot because it's a circle.  Yeah.  You can't find a spot when you're sitting in a circle.  It was.  Yeah.  You can't back into any corners or anything.  I thought someone was going to throw some.  There's no fucking way I'd ever do a virus show in the round.  There's no way I'd ever turn my back on the pest.  Even if they liked you, it would just be like.  Watching you settle in like, okay, all right, I got it.  It's a circle.  I got to kind of just keep moving.  And then you fucking.  It was great, man. 
[00:32:30]  It was a great set.  A lot of fun last night.  I had a good time.  Yeah, I actually went up there.  It was funny.  They had that green room area where you waited.  Yeah.  And Bobby's like, hey, want to go up there and say goodbye to Opie?  I go, he's in that green room.  She goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm thinking, he just fucking saw me like seven hours ago.  Yeah.  And he's going to see me tomorrow.  There's no way he's up there.  So I ended up walking up there.  And of course you weren't in there.  No.  I was in the audience just hanging out.  Yeah.  Because Bobby goes, are you in the green room?  I don't know.  What green room?  I wasn't invited to no fucking green room.  I got a ticket. 
[00:33:00]  And I'm sitting watching my pals.  Yeah.  But what was the Sarah McLachlan line about the one dog with the one eye before I move  on?  Oh, no.  I was talking about the dogs all bandaged up.  Yeah.  Like they're on MASH.  It's probably your material.  So you probably don't want to do it on the radio.  He just basically explains all the dogs in the Sarah McLachlan fucking commercial.  Oh, the last.  Oh, just talking.  I said my favorite one was that one-eyed pug.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's a great dog.  Bring that home with the kids.  I'm sure that won't freak them out.  Yeah.  Mommy, did you get us a dog? 
[00:33:30]  Ah!  Just let him smell you.  Just let him smell you.  Don't let him.  What is it?  Don't approach him from the right.  Don't approach him from the right.  Just let him smell you.  But I want to make it clear, though, because I'm not saying don't go out and arrest this dog.  Oh, no.  All I'm saying is that they're really soft-selling some of the dogs that are down there.  But you haven't got this dog, this pit bull dude.  This is the greatest dog ever.  Bill, I think everyone in the garden understands that you're an animal lover in the end. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, they were just showing how ridiculous this commercial was and how they don't explain.  Because I think people do need to know what was the issue with this particular animal before you bring it home.  Right.  You know?  Try to.  Well, you know what?  That's what I said, because my dog, somebody found it.  It had been out by the L.A. River for like two weeks.  Oh, good.  So you don't take it to any rivers when you're walking.  No, my girl's sitting there going like, she was like, no, no, no, we didn't get him to shelter.  He was by the L.A. River for like two weeks. 
[00:34:30]  I go, yeah, and he didn't die.  What do you think the dog was doing out there?  Right.  Eating berries?  Right.  Choking out coyotes and stuff?  Of course.  Yeah.  It needs meat.  It needs some kind of meat.  Eating some homeless guy's leg off or something.  I don't know what it did.  It probably digested a few calves in itself.  My dog does not like guys.  Yeah, what's that about?  Probably the last person.  I have no idea.  You've got to piece it together.  It's like a mystery.  So do you wear a dress when you're home or something?  What do you do?  No, no, it loves me. 
[00:35:00]  Dude, pit bulls are ridiculously loyal.  They're just like, I like you, and I like you.  And that's it.  Who the fuck is that?  That's the deal.  I think I'm a pit bull.  But if it's a female, the dog is cool.  Unless they come with that crazy energy sometimes.  Girls, they get into that mothering baby like,  They stick their face.  And the dog, you know, freak it out like, what the fuck?  Yeah.  He does that.  You feel it in the bottom of your soul. 
[00:35:30]  You had a good time last night, huh?  I had a great fucking time.  I really had a good time.  I could tell.  I could tell.  You were into it.  And then you did do your John Bonham line at the end.  As people were applauding, though.  I had to.  They could barely hear it because you were like, thank you.  I almost forgot.  But then I almost, because I forgot, because I went up there.  And I'm like, I got to do it at some point.  But then I got up there.  And it's like, I got to get going.  And then.  Which line was it?  I heard Bonham.  What did you say?  I just did the intro.  John Henry Bonham.  Oh, right, right, right.  Right, right, right. 
[00:36:00]  I'd also done it during the sound check.  I did that.  And everybody got a big laugh out of that.  But I met some security guard there who'd been working there since the late 60s.  And he basically, he was there during the songwriting, the Sames taping, when the Bruins  went into the stands.  He was like, ah, I was a younger guy.  Yeah, I had to go down there and break up.  A lot of lawsuits.  A lot of lawsuits.  I was just like, wow.  This guy's.  He's seen it all.  He's seen everything.  All right.  Bill is here to save the day.  Not that Danny and Sam didn't do a good job.  They did a great job.  Fucking Mars.  What can I tell you? 
[00:36:30]  You got anything on Bill Burr, dogs, Led Zeppelin?  I like how he's sitting like 20 feet behind the microphone.  He just fully realizes he has nothing to add.  He's allergic to this.  What do you got?  Before we take a break, Mars.  What do you got?  I talked about a lot of stuff.  My favorite.  Just pick anything we just talked about.  Chime in, for the love of God, so we hope he can stop staring at each other.  Right.  And punch it up a little bit.  It's kind of fucked up when you put me on the stage like that. 
[00:37:00]  Like in radio, people are talking.  You bring up a topic and you go, go.  It's not even that.  It's like how radio works.  You talk, you talk, you talk, and then you kind of like tag it.  Like, oh, Bill mentioned dogs, so I got a little dog thing.  Well, I understand.  Tell us a dog story.  You must have a dog story.  Jim and Shepard bit me one time when I was about nine years old.  So I am.  This time, tell it again with more detail and make it funny.  Make it funny.  That's pretty fucked up.  That could have been three minutes of radio. 
[00:37:30]  He just said, hey, Opie, last night I opened for Dane at the Madison Square Garden and it  was fun.  Great.  Like you fucking just like ask a question or go, really?  Show some interest.  Something.  All right.  As the morning goes on, if I'm allowed to stay at the big boy table.  How did you get bit by this fucking dog?  Yeah, that's a good story.  Well, okay.  As I was growing up, going to school in the early mornings, I always heard the German  Shepard next door.  We lived in an apartment building in New York City, right?  So the apartment doors are very close to one another. 
[00:38:00]  So every morning as I'm going to school, I hear this barking of this big German Shepard.  And he was always trying to break down the door, which seemed to me as a kid.  Don't lose your confidence.  So I'm not losing confidence.  I'm just telling the story.  So every morning, I wasn't how dry his lips are.  I was actually petrified.  Enjoy that at home.  It doesn't help that Sam is looking like he's solving the Middle East problem.  So I'm petrified every morning going to school, you know, thinking that this dog is actually 
[00:38:30]  going to get out of his apartment and attack me.  And sure enough, one day, I'm going out.  That's not me, by the way.  That's Opie.  What?  The lips.  That.  What?  It wasn't me before.  You all right?  No, don't tell him.  You all right?  So on this particular day, I'm going to school and the asshole next door, it was a kid  the same age as I, he was always fucking around attempting to open the door.  A little bit, a little crack.  And on this one day, the dog got past him and he just attacked me, jumped on me and 
[00:39:00]  came towards the face.  He didn't get me.  He got my shoulder.  And from that day.  Had you been taking jujitsu at this point?  I was a little punk back then, you know.  So where did he get you?  He got me in the shoulder, but it was winter time.  So he got the coat, not too much of the skin, but that shit scared the hell out of me.  I mean, I'm from this, like you was asking yesterday.  Did you have one of those big puffy coats from the 70s?  Yeah, the downs with goose down.  You remember those?  Feathers flying all over the place.  Did you soil your britches? 
[00:39:30]  Brother, I'll tell you what, man.  I think I did.  I had a skid mark, man.  It was pretty scary.  I heard what you were saying.  So yesterday I was talking about the dog I'm most scared of.  And you're going to say you're scared of German Shepherds too?  Your number one dog?  Well, yeah, absolutely.  That's exactly.  But many times I want to add to a topic when you guys are talking, but I don't know when  to go ahead and interject because I'm not part of the talking staff.  Definitely.  On air.  Not.  You raise your hand or something.  You make eye contact.  Make believe we're in a bar. 
[00:40:00]  It's the same fucking thing.  Really?  I could participate a lot more.  There's no magic to this.  Trust you, me.  Oh, you could participate more.  A lot more.  Yes, I can.  And we just have to trust you?  No, I just know how to do it.  Trust you, me.  I need you guys to teach me how to do it.  That's all.  Not always break me down like fucking Sam.  I'm done teaching this shit to people.  But I'm a good guy that came along.  Trust me.  Go wire something.  Why?  Mars frequently says that he was not meant to be an engineer.  He tells me that he was not meant to be an engineer.  He was meant to be one of the creative guys. 
[00:40:30]  You told me that.  Not on radio.  I went to school for a film.  I like, you know.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, I love film and video and all that good stuff.  So, yeah, on that aspect, yes.  Maybe not speaking eloquently, but, you know, I can write a script.  Will you stop moving around?  Look at Bill just staring the fuck out of me.  He's amazed.  Back to that moment when you said, should he stick around or leave?  I was like, why did I do this?  Even Bill's giving up.  We had a West Highland Terrier when I was a kid, and we turned it into an absolute maniac. 
[00:41:00]  I had four brothers, and we just teased the shit out of this dog, and we started playing  the glove game, which is where you took a gardener's glove, and you just started mushing  him in the face, you know, like Sean Avery.  A little face wash, like it was the playoffs.  A little Sean Avery.  So then he would start biting, he started biting too hard.  We didn't know any better, okay?  This is before, like, cable and, like, chicken soup.  The dog whisperer and all that shit.  All that shit.  See, I added there, Mars.  That's what you do.  Okay.  I punched it up just a little.  Nothing crazy, but just enough to keep the energy and the story and the listeners interested. 
[00:41:30]  So this thing would start biting too hard, so we moved on to, like, a hockey stick, and  we were sitting there, like, you know, like, more like, you know, you're, like, you're  digging the puck out of the corner.  We'd kind of be doing that stuff.  Right.  And at some point, I forget what we were giving, like, the broom, he started doing that bite,  you know, where they shake their head, like, they do that thing, which is basically, that  goes back to the wolf thing, like, break the prey's neck.  Sure.  So we thought that shit was hilarious, and then the thing started biting us, like, in the  legs doing that thing. 
[00:42:00]  So one day, the thing was begging for food, so my brother was eating a sandwich, so I started  crawling up, going, hey, I'm going to get the food, I'm going to get the food.  The thing fucking latched onto my face and did that thing.  Dude, I literally thought I was going to be deformed.  Holy shit.  I went to the bathroom going, please God, please God, and I came, I had, I had, uh, two puncture  marks, right?  Two puncture wounds here, and one was in the mouth.  His underbite caught the inside of my mouth, and I had to go into my dad's office, and he  stitched me up, and then I went to school the next day.  Wait, why is your dad's, see, this is, see, Mars, this is perfect right here, if you want 
[00:42:30]  to learn.  Was it a doctor?  He casually goes.  No, he was a painter.  He painted, but, you know, we didn't have a lot of money, he used to darn his own stockings.  But he casually said, my dad stitched me up, so that's where, that's a great place to jump  in and go, what, what?  Because most people go to the ER, so why did your dad stitch up?  Yeah, my dad, my dad's a, uh.  No, I know he's a dentist.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess he'd stitch up a little bit.  He used to work on babies with cleft palates, so yeah, what I had was a joke.  Oh, so he could handle that.  Gotcha.  But the funny thing is, we didn't get rid of the dog. 
[00:43:00]  Like, nowadays, I guess the dog would get put down and it would make the news and shit, but  no, we kept the dog, I had to go to school the next day, face all fucked up, I got bit  by a dog, whose dog?  Oh, my dog.  It would have been a better story if your dad was like a garbageman and he was stitching  you up or something.  Because they're the, see, Mara's trying to move on and then maybe people will call and  go, well, my dad used to stitch me up and he didn't, he wasn't a dentist.  See how it works?  Gotcha.  Because there's a lot of fathers out there that, oh, I'll do some fucking operating on  you myself.  He used to do all of it right at home. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  That's pretty weird.  Well, yeah, we had, you know, five boys in our family, we used to always do shit to each  other and then there was always, the alibi was always, I was running through the woods  and I tripped.  Like, I took a big rock trying to scare my brother one time, just threw it, you know,  and it landed right on his head.  My brother did the exact same thing to my cousin.  Dude, it was like a one in a million shot.  It's like hitting the lottery and he's like somehow, it's like the cartoon where the dude's  going over the horizon and somehow you just catch him right on top of the head.  Me and Bill, we've had very, very similar upbringings and you had a lot of boys in your 
[00:44:00]  family too, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  My brother, I think it was his confirmation, we had all my cousins over and stuff and we  were playing the rock game where you just throw them up in the air and hope for the  best and it misses you by a foot and you laugh and shit.  This is the days before video games.  All that shit.  This is what we did.  So, my brother throws a rock, sure enough, it hits my cousin Danny right on the eye.  He needs stitches, everything.  This thing fucking did damage.  He probably has a scar to this day.  My brother was, he wasn't allowed to enjoy his own confirmation. 
[00:44:30]  He was grounded for his own confirmation.  Like, the whole family's there, cousins, aunts, uncles, and he has to stay up in his room  for his own confirmation because he did this fucking rock trick.  I got this one here.  My brother threw me off the porch.  Yeah.  He was swinging on the swing and he pissed me off.  So, as he was coming down, I took a broom and I just stuck it right in his, like right  in his gut and I was holding him up.  And he's like, I'm going to fucking kill you. 
[00:45:00]  And I let go.  I turned around to run, but he had the momentum of the swing coming down.  So, he caught me right as I was at the top stair.  He just gave me that one little push, like fucking Claude Lemieux.  It was a Dale Hunter.  Who did that to the guy who scored the goal?  And he just fucking cross-checked him.  I think it was Dale Hunter.  Yeah.  So, I literally did.  Your knowledge is better than mine.  Like a fucking lawn dart.  Yeah.  I went down the stairs and I went right into, you know, like when you don't have a walkway,  you just have like the stones.  Sure.  One of them was like sticking up a little bit.  I just, yeah, right into it. 
[00:45:30]  I still have like, I missed a missing bone.  I can feel the bone I'm missing in my skull.  Yeah.  Did your dad operate on that one?  Oh, yeah.  He's pissed.  It was like, what was the worst thing your dad operated on?  You know what I mean?  Like the line is, well, you know.  Well, we used to have to assist him because, I don't know, just.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  The most disgusting one.  By the way, Mars, before Bill continued, see what happened?  Because I said that casual dad thing, like, what do you mean fucking your dad stitched up?  Now, look at the phones.  You said you want to learn about radio.  Now everyone has a fucking story. 
[00:46:00]  We can do another hour on this, Mars.  Here's one.  But then we might not, though, because we've got a lot to do today.  Here's one.  My brother one time.  So you had a sister, dad, or your brothers, whatever.  My brother.  So one time my brother jumped out of a tree.  You had to jump out of this tree.  I don't know how the fuck it happened.  There was some sort of like stick, but a big branch was like a spear.  And he got like impaled on it, literally for like one and a half seconds.  He was literally on this thing.  And we were like, what the fuck?  And he lands on the ground.  And he looked so ridiculous. 
[00:46:30]  We were all laughing our asses off.  And he even started laughing.  And then he lifted his shirt up.  And it was like that darker kind of, I might have hit an artery blood.  Holy shit.  And then he starts fucking freaking out.  Right.  And yeah, we stitched him.  That one was gross.  I could deal with the head.  Yeah.  There's not a lot of like tissue.  It looks like you don't go that deep.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, no.  But like, I remember his chest.  No, it had like that whitish yellow tissue.  Yeah, I almost fucking yacked.  You don't realize how much fat you got in you, even as a kid.  That was disgusting.  Some of those cuts, you would see that white shit or that darkest yellow shit. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, my brother was screaming as he stitched up on the phone.  Well, Bill, we got the phone's ringing.  We got dad stories.  All right, here we go.  Start it off slow.  You know what?  We need to take a little break, though.  So if you guys could stick through the break, we'll take your dad stories.  We also have Doug Stanhope coming in.  And Dr. Steve wants to do a little something something with what?  Diabetes and...  Are we giving it away yet?  No, well...  Dr. Steve has a pretty good bit we're going to do today.  He's going to test for diabetes. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we say what it is yet?  You can.  It's your show.  Yeah, Dr. Steve, basically, Bill, is going to taste urine.  By tasting your urine, he could tell if you have fucking diabetes.  It's like an old-school way of finding out if you have diabetes.  It's supposed to be sweeter.  No, the old-school way is one day your foot falls off, and then you die the next day.  That's the way I'm doing it.  So whose urine is he fucking tasting?  Well, I believe Pat from Munaki is coming in.  Oh, perfect.  And then...  I could use a few one-liners from him today.  So he'll taste some of his urine, and then... 
[00:48:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  Some of us will supply ours.  I would love for Dr. Steve to taste my urine.  Basically, Pat...  He can't get, like, hepatitis or some shit?  You can't just go around drinking other people's urine, and there's no side effects.  The old-school doctors do it all the time.  I believe if you're a doctor, you can drink urine.  Yeah.  According to the lawyers, if you are a doctor, you can drink other people's...  I'm not talking about the freakiness of it.  I'm talking about health issues.  No, see, urine is sterile, don't they always say?  I think.  No, Bill, it's...  Isn't this classic dialogue between two dumb Americans here? 
[00:48:30]  It's sterile.  You can't catch anything.  He goes, urine is sterile, I think.  Yeah, we're a couple of guys who never went to medical school.  Yeah, let's just put this out over the fucking airway.  We joke about that on our show, and just because we have microphones in front of us, we feel like we're experts all of a sudden.  We read one stupid paragraph of a really important topic, and we think we know it all.  Whenever I'm doing some magazine little thing, and they go, how would you describe, who are you on stage?  I'm like, I'm like that loud guy in the bar.  I go, who really starts to make sense? 
[00:49:00]  And then halfway through what I'm saying, you realize I had to go to summer school every year in high school.  And you're like, oh, yeah, that's right, this guy's an idiot.  But I think just about everyone, you ask them a follow-up question on something they're talking about, and they fall apart.  You don't like that banana, do you?  It's hard as a fucking rock.  There was a little observation there.  See there, Morris?  He didn't like the banana.  I noticed that, and I said, wow, Bill, you don't like the banana.  That could lead to maybe talking about the FDA or something.  Who gets one?  I asked for a banana, and this fucking kid gets one more green than yellow. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, no.  Oh, Jesus.  He doesn't understand how to pick a fucking banana?  Mars can't do radio.  Our interns can't pick bananas.  This is a terrible place.  Sam has a high voice.  I mean, no, it's just a...  You know what you sound like?  What?  At the beginning of that Beastie Boy, you've got to fight for your right to party.  I'm like, we'll have a party.  He's like, yeah!  Oh, Sam, you're fucked.  Yeah!  Do we have that? 
[00:50:00]  We're going to listen to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah!  He's going to have the glasses and everything.  It's a unique voice.  You like ACDC there, Bill?  Yeah, I'd say I like him a little bit.  We've got some box sets to give away.  I just want to throw that out there, too.  A little later, though.  We got that?  Travis?  I thought you were joking, too.  It's only, apparently, it's only in the music video, so I could try and find that here  on the tube.  You tube it up.  Yeah, all right.  We could do that.  AC, I'm buying, for Christmas, for my Christmas gift, I'm actually getting ACDC has a box set 
[00:50:30]  of all their albums.  Wow.  And, actually, I'm one of those guys who actually still has a hi-fi.  Oh, really?  Oh, I fucking love it.  I actually went out on eBay and I bought...  You like money.  I bought my dad's record collection.  What?  Basically, all this...  My dad's got some bizarre...  The Ted Heath Orchestra.  Was he...  So he was before...  Persuasive Percussion.  Wait, how old's your dad?  69.  Wow, 69. 
[00:51:00]  So he should have been into the Beatles thing, right?  Like, my dad just missed the Beatles thing, so he's got all that, like, fucking...  Can you remember all that?  My dad liked big band.  He liked that kind of stuff.  Yeah, yeah, that was my dad.  So once, like, once rock and roll came, I don't think he...  He never even jumped on the Elvis bandwagon.  He was like, ah.  Yeah, my dad just missed.  My dad missed by a year or two.  So it was like Frank Sinatra.  My mom actually saw Elvis in concert right before he hit big.  That's like her only concert.  Like, I went to one.  And who'd you see?  I saw Elvis. 
[00:51:30]  I'm like, wait, did you see?  Madison Square Garden.  I saw him in a fair.  He was standing on a bale of hay.  And, you know, he was moving around a lot.  Jesus.  It just says that casually.  All right, here it is.  This is what Sam sounds like.  Now, boys, don't get into any trouble while Mommy and Daddy are gone.  The acting is horrendous.  And don't make a mess.  Do you like parties? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  We can invite all our friends and have soda and pie.  Yeah.  I sound like...  You sound like you.  You are so proud.  I don't sound like that.  Anyone want to acknowledge that Sam's in studio, you can go, yeah, on the phone.  Imitate it.  Yeah.  You got it.  I don't sound like that.  I don't sound like that.  All right, listen, we got to get...  You got that vocal fry, I believe is what they call it.  We got to get Bill Burr a new banana. 
[00:52:30]  Mars will hang out for a little bit.  We got Doug Stanhope.  I got to tuff my way through.  No.  Matt Ryan will get you a different way.  Nothing worse than tuffing through a banana that's not ripe.  Doesn't that shit get you sick?  It gets me sick.  He's doing it.  He's doing what you're talking about.  He's doing it.  That was all right, because I'll drink my own urine.  Ah, it's a call.  There you go.  You're going to teach him callbacks?  No, no, no.  That's way above Mars.  Let's slow it out.  Let's step at a time.  No, you don't want to...  Let's just deal with trying to interact as a human being. 
[00:53:00]  Gotcha.  The callback thing, that's way above you right now.  Hey, Bill, I want to play your Yankee World Series rank going into break.  Okay.  It's doing real well on my YouTube channel, too.  And a lot of...  We didn't tell Bill.  A lot of places are picking it up.  Oh, is that right?  Fark.  Breitbart.  Breitbart.  Comedy websites, sports websites.  They're all talking about what Bill Burr has to say about the Yankees.  No, it's...  Nothing but congratulations to all of them.  It's hilarious.  Hell of an accomplishment.  The clip's going viral a little bit, Bill.  A little bit, a little bit. 
[00:53:30]  We want to play one more time for everybody, so we'll go to break with Bill Burr congratulating  all the Yankee fans on that great World Series victory.  Bill Burr, man, incredible.  Coming from nowhere.  Out of nowhere.  Right.  And if you want to listen to it later as well, OP Radio on YouTube, but here it is on our  show today.  I'm dealing with a Yankees victory here today.  Oh, what a story.  What a story.  Amazing, right?  It's amazing.  It's fantastic.  It's a Cinderella story, isn't it?  Just a bunch of knock-around guys.  A bunch of lugs.  Who would have thought? 
[00:54:00]  Knock-around.  Who would have thought?  You know, I thought the USA Today had the greatest quote.  Brian Cashman was just saying, you know, he was so happy for A-Rod, because he's been  through a lot.  Yeah, he sure has.  I can't imagine trying to eke out a living, banging Madonna and getting blown by Kate Hudson  just on your 90 million square foot patio.  Making 100 million a year.  Having so much money, you can actually control the weather in your state.  I mean, the poor guy.  I mean, he's been through so much.  And just to see, I mean, who would have thought at the beginning of the season, too, was  CeCe Sabathia, A.J. Burnett, Derek Jeter, A-Rod, Mark Teixeira. 
[00:54:30]  Hedeki Matsui, Johnny Damon, Mariano Rivera.  Who would have ever thought at the beginning of the season that just this group of just  lovable lugs could somehow come together and just manage to just pull it off?  I mean, it warms the heart.  It's what America is all about.  That anybody truly has a chance in this world.  Sure, there's the Walmarts.  But if you have a dream in a hardware store, you can do it.  It's inspiring.  It's going to see a small market team going all the way. 
[00:55:00]  Hang in there, Pittsburgh.  Hang in there.  It is inspiring.  Fucking Bill.  It's a good small market story.  Oh, God.  It's truly one of the greatest championships, one of the greatest achievements I've ever  seen in my life.  To just, I mean, just seriously.  Go, Bill, go.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, just the heart and soul of that team is just, it's absolutely incredible.  They've all been through a lot, right?  They've just been through so much.  They've been through so much.  And it really has been such a long time.  I mean, eight long years that they had to suffer through winning divisions every year. 
[00:55:30]  A couple of pennants.  I mean, I don't know how these Yankee fans did it.  But really, I mean, congratulations for hanging in there.  You're truly a sports fan.  And Anthony, the first time in eight years I've seen you wear a Yankee hat.  It's fantastic to see.  That is true.  He's a true sports fan.  It's just a phenomenal, one of the truly great championships I've ever seen.  My hat's off to you.  Congratulations to all the Yankee fans.  Yeah, and it says that he's been a Yankee fan for many years.  I've seen it.  Oh, he totally has.  But this is the first time I've ever seen him in a Yankee hat.  Oh, no, no, no.  They all have.  He's been for years.  There's really been nothing to cheer about for eight years. 
[00:56:00]  So, you know.  I understand, yeah.  Just having two of the greatest shortstops ever.  One deciding to play third base.  I'm expecting Ryan Howard to sign next year and agree to play second.  No, it's fantastic.  It's a great league.  It's run really well.  San Diego Padres have eight-year-olds playing in their outfield at this point.  Because that's all they could get.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  No, it's going to be great. 
[00:56:30]  And I can't wait for the Yankees-Red Sox again next year.  It's going to be as exciting as Friday the 13th Part 9.  Oh, my God.  There's a psycho in the...  Is he still in the lake?  I love a league where it's the same four teams every year.  It's absolutely fantastic.  The sport does have a problem.  It has a few problems.  I'm hoping the Red Sox re-sign Eric Gagne again.  That was a great one to do.  I think the Yankees and the Red Sox have, like, buzzards flying around.  Flying around, like, the Pirate Stadium.  And any time anybody hits a triple, they just swoop down and they grab them. 
[00:57:00]  Stick them on their bench.  To go with your rant, Sean in North Carolina.  Do you believe in miracles?  Because after that victory yesterday, I certainly do.  Oh, this is absolutely incredible.  I had a tear in my eye.  I just couldn't believe it.  I mean...  So unexpected.  To see the bankers stealing all this money and to finally see the little guy just come through.  It was just absolutely fantastic.  It was the same feeling as the Olympics when the United States won the hockey game in the Olympics back there in 1980. 
[00:57:30]  It's just absolutely phenomenal.  Just like that.  I knew you'd have something to say.  Oh, it's just tremendous.  Let me be the first to fucking go bravo.  Fucking bravo on that.  I knew you had a couple in you, but...  That's like your Philly rant right there.  Oh, God.  That's up there, bro.  No.  I mean, no, dude.  I'm a Red Sox fan.  We kind of followed him over the cliff there.  So, I mean, we kind of jumped the shark.  Yeah, that's kind of true.  The Eric Gagne signing was always just kind of like, all right, is there any competition left? 
[00:58:00]  It's just like, let's have four teams sign everybody in the league and then go beat the crap out of the Twins.  Four games to one, bitch.  I mean, I think that the Brewers have a girl with braces playing shortstop.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal league.  Yeah, it was a good win.  Oh, it was fantastic.  It's great for the city. 
[00:58:30]  Well, it's good about it.  Parade tomorrow.  11 a.m.  Big parade down the Canyon of Heroes.  I mean, I'm actually psyched that they won it last night because my show's tomorrow night.  And I was just like, there's nobody.  You can't compete with that.  There's a bunch of people.  Oh, wait.  They would have played tonight, though, right?  Seventh game would have been tonight.  Oh, it would have been tonight?  Yeah.  Hey, how come it went all the way into November?  That never happens, right?  It happened 9-11, obviously.  Yeah, because they kind of delayed some things.  Yeah.  I don't know what the fuck did happen.  It usually ends in October, right?  Would they add more games?  I know.  They don't play enough.  And I thought there was a lot of quick series. 
[00:59:00]  I don't even remember a game seven either.  How can it go into November when you look at the Colorado Rockies?  We were in Denver when they were playing.  It was 20 fucking two degrees.  What are they going to do in November if they get in the World Series?  Well, 20-degree weather?  The league's got it all figured out.  They make sure those teams aren't in it anymore.  Yeah, that's it.  You'll never see them in it.  They figure that out.  Pat from Wynaki, the Bad News Yankees.  Yes, Anthony.  Congratulations on your Bad News Yankees.  Just like that fine movie. 
[00:59:30]  That was great.  The comparison is unbelievable, actually.  I mean, I don't know the genius of Brian Cashman to be able to sit there and put that team together.  To sit there and have to be like, we need a right fielder.  Who's the best guy available?  What's he being offered?  Give him $8 million more.  Next problem.  I mean, the guy truly knows what he's doing.  I could never do that job if I had a bottomless pit of money.  How do you do it?  It's just incredible.  Holy shit.  Congratulations. 
[01:00:00]  Fantastic.  Good for you, twin.  It was a big win.  They're saying they did it for Steinbrenner, but I think Anthony and Jimmy were talking that no one saw Steinbrenner.  Like, no, he's got to be in really bad shape that he wasn't even at that stadium.  He's not even making an appearance on video.  Yeah, he has to be in bad shape, man.  That's awful.  Dude, that's one of my big fears, man, to seriously, like, I mean, you know, obviously I'm breaking the Yankees' balls here, but I don't wish bad health on anybody, man.  I would never take it to that point.  That's brutal.  With the Alzheimer's?  Yeah, but I've actually run into a Red Sox fan who made a joke about that, and I was just like, dude, really? 
[01:00:30]  You're going to take it to that level?  Good Lord.  What's the karma?  It is a game.  Yeah, why don't you go deflate the wheels on somebody's wheelchair?  I should have said tires.  It would have been funny.  That's right.  Sometimes it's the same word twice.  The wheels with the wheels.  The same word twice.  Always funny.  It's funny, Jimmy, is that you run to the end of it hoping you have a tag or something.  Yeah, you're hoping there's some other description for a little rascal without the word wheel in a time. 
[01:01:00]  Wheels, the wheels.  It's the worst.  It's funnier and comedic than using the same word twice.  I've got to turn because we're taking turns.  Same word twice.  Sorry, folks.  It really is.  Mike in Florida wants to add to Bill Burr's rant there.  Mike?  Hey, let me tell you something.  Any time that a team can go out and spend $1.6 billion since the last time they won a World Series,  it just really makes you feel good about the sport.  Like Bill said, it's a heartwarming story. 
[01:01:30]  It is.  It's unbelievable.  Do you think the Pirates have spent $1.6 billion in the last eight, nine years?  They actually have the worst owners in the league.  They're actually one of the most profitable teams, though.  Well, because, yeah, they don't spend any money on the actual players.  Yeah, they dump all their guys.  But on the other side, it's just like, look, you've got to spend at least – I mean, the Red Sox this year only spent $1.25,  but that's only because they got rid of Manny's contract.  But, I mean, realistically, you've got to be spending like $1.60.  What's $1.60?  $160 million.  $160 million, okay.  To $200 million to even – to get – I mean, every once in a while you'll have like the Devil Rays will get in. 
[01:02:00]  I mean, that's like truly great scouting.  But when all those guys are up for free agency –  Then you lose them.  Yeah, the Sox and the Yankees are going to take them.  You can't keep them.  I don't know.  I'm sure they're going to get Lee right here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Cliff Lee is –  He had the audacity to win a couple of games.  That's it.  Yeah, that son of a bitch.  You've got to join the mafia now.  That's it.  Hey, listen.  You're one of us.  You just tap on the shoulder.  But I like Philly.  I can drive up to New York. 
[01:02:30]  It's not that long a drive.  No, you don't understand.  Nah.  You're ours.  You're with us.  And if we want you just to sit on the bench so no one else can have you, that's the way it's going down.  Put on this shirt.  How do they figure it out?  A little salary cap action in baseball?  I would say whatever –  It's kind of working for other –  Whatever football is doing.  Because I think football is the best-run league where –  You've got pretty much the same core players year after year, which is nice to see.  There we go.  Come on.  It's so sad to see Damon without the beard and the hair. 
[01:03:00]  Damon, you've got to get himself respectable to put the pin scratch on.  Actually, you know what?  I was working out in the Midwest, and I was near a religious sect, and they were claiming that Jesus is coming back next year,  and the Yankees are going to sign him to play right field.  They're still working out the whole beard issue.  See if they can enforce that.  They're going to sew Ted Williams' upside-down frozen head to his shoulder to give him advice when he goes up.  You mean Ted Williams' dented head after they were batting around that room?  They dropped his head. 
[01:03:30]  He was sitting on a tuna can upside down.  You know what?  You deserve it.  You'd fucking deserve it if you're that stupid.  There's no cure for not having a body.  I can see if they froze the whole fucking thing.  What, are you just going to bring his head back to life?  Start wheeling him around in a wheelchair with a wheel?  Holy shit.  We should get a bunch of people together and go get Ted Williams' head. 
[01:04:00]  Just break into that fucking place and say, look, we're taking the fucking head.  They should sell pieces of it, just like they did with Yankee Stadium.  Just smash it on the ground.  Dude, I got his ear.  It's Opie and Bill Burr and now Doug Stanhope.  Good morning. 
[01:04:30]  What's up, Doug?  Not a thing.  Doug's playing comics tonight and tomorrow here in New York City.  Is that part of the New York Comedy Festival?  No, no, it's not.  You're a rebel?  Yeah.  Doing your own thing?  I mean, what's the difference?  The festival is not like...  I mean, fucking, it's New York.  Any given night at the cellar is a comedy festival.  That's true.  People don't understand that.  It's an all-star lineup every night at the Comedy Cellar.  You never know who's going to be on that stage. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, it's fucking New York.  It's like having the L.A. Actors Festival.  It's fucking there anyway.  Jimmy's like, oh, yeah, Stephen Wright was at the cellar the other night.  And, oh, yeah, I was hanging with Chris Rock for a little bit.  And it's just all casual.  Billy Crystal, Robin Williams.  Billy Crystal, Robin Williams.  They just show up and do a few minutes.  Yeah.  Jesus, that's amazing.  Doug, you don't like the Yankees either, right?  We just played Bill Burr.  I don't even like baseball, but I watch it to hope the Yankees lose.  I really have that much fucking hate. 
[01:05:30]  Where's the hate come from?  The fact that they're fine players?  Self-loathing or...  Sad childhood.  Yeah, some awkward place, but it manifests itself in the fucking places like the Yankees.  They're all such douchebags.  What was your line about the Yankees?  I saw it on YouTube.  It's because they fucking buy their team.  They're supposed to win.  So to root for them is like going to a casino and cheering for the house.  Well, they have the fucking... 
[01:06:00]  And when you don't even have money on the game, like just fucking standing behind a blackjack  table and going, come on, fucking dealer, bust his ass.  Then fucking, that's my dealer, bitch.  Fucking...  A lot of people...  Oh, yes, Danny, sorry.  I've heard that argument a lot because a lot of people have been saying that.  Like, I'm not...  Are you a Yankees fan?  No, I'm not.  But like people will comment and stuff and like...  But you're a Met fan.  I am a Met fan.  But I just think that argument is just slightly ridiculous.  I just think if maybe these ball clubs, you know, managed their clubs better and, you 
[01:06:30]  know, had better farm systems, then more people would show up at their games.  If they're winning more games, then more people are showing up.  Then they could, you know, inch up ticket prices and then they could afford the better  players for the next season.  I would agree with you if it was like the 70s or 80s.  That farm system thing doesn't mean shit anymore because these guys are just now buying  the best players out there.  What I'm saying is the finances of baseball don't make sense anymore because there are  cities, like Bill was bringing up yesterday, that cannot win the World Series.  I mean, it is a long shot for a lot of these teams.  Sure.  But I mean, if the Brewers, you know, let's say the Brewers got a better team together 
[01:07:00]  and, you know, built up some kind of minor league system.  Look at the Rangers.  Look at the Rangers.  The Rangers went out and they got A-Rod.  They got A-Rod and then they were busted.  They had no more money for anybody.  So now all they had was this $200 million shortstop.  They couldn't build a team around.  They didn't have that kind of a month.  They didn't have that kind of money.  Where the Yankees can get A-Rod, keep Jeter.  Dude, you got to remember, that guy was a fucking shortstop, decided to play third base.  Now, I'm a Red Sox fan, so I'm not bitching about that aspect of it because, you know, 
[01:07:30]  whatever they don't sign, we're going to fucking sign.  Like, I'm just saying my bitch about baseball is it's basically going to be the top four or five teams every fucking year  and then maybe a Devil Rays will sneak in or, you know.  Do you have a bitch about the fact that it's not even a fucking equal sport?  Like, what size is a baseball field?  Exactly.  Whatever fucking size they want, evidently.  Like, they don't even have the same rules amongst leagues. 
[01:08:00]  It's just fucking pointless.  You build the ballpark, too, like, around, like, your best players sometimes.  Like, did you ever see Yankee Stadium back when Ruth played?  Oh, yeah, there was the short, the little short porch.  You could have.  That was where they figured out, wait, babe hits a lot of balls to this exact spot.  Let's move just that part of the wall in.  Dude, and the fence was like a foot off the ground.  If you backed up for a fly ball, you fell into the front fucking row.  Yeah, Jim's, uh, switch mics if it, yeah, your mic sucks today, Doug. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, I don't know what's going on.  Does it?  Yeah, just, can you work off that?  Yeah.  All right, hold on a minute.  Yeah, try that one.  That one's just over-modulated, Mark.  But I'm saying, like.  Hold on, to Danny's point.  Danny's point isn't bad.  Like, yeah, you bring up a farm system and, all right, you got all your guys.  Hold on, hold on.  You got all your guys up there.  Let's say they win the World Series.  The problem, though, is that they can't afford to keep their players.  Look, this is.  You know what I mean?  But at the same time.  You could build a team, yes.  You could still do that in baseball.  But the problem is, when it comes to paying these guys to stay around, they can't do 
[01:09:00]  that.  Sure.  So then they all end up going to the Yankees or the Red Sox or the Dodgers.  The Angels are doing a good job grabbing these players.  And over time, you could accumulate, as a ball club, that wealth to secure these players  for the next season.  And that's just not happening, though.  Well, but I'm saying, but you can't penalize the Yankees because they've been successful.  It comes down to.  No, no, you can't.  I'm not saying to even do it.  No, Yankees won fair and square in the end.  It's fine.  Right.  But I'm just saying the sport itself is a little broken.  Yeah, no, this is the problem.  It's like with TV contracts, the big TV markets like New York, Boston, L.A., and those types 
[01:09:30]  of things.  The amount of money that those guys can generate, you know, probably with the same amount  of viewers.  It's just different media markets that you can't compete with it.  My only thing is, like, I'm not sitting here, like, I'm always, like, honestly bitching  about how much money the Yankees spend.  It would be ridiculous because, you know, the Red Sox are always, like, within $20 million.  So I'm not complaining about that.  But what I'm saying is, just as a fan about baseball, some of the best teams, those Kansas  City Royal teams of the late 70s, when the Orioles won it in 83, even when the Padres 
[01:10:00]  came on and they played, who did they play?  They played the Tigers in 84.  It was good.  The Brewers in 81 or 82 when they played St. Louis, just to fucking mix it up.  But if every year it's going to be the same four fucking teams, why have the other 26?  What is the point of those guys?  And it's not like, look, I'm not saying that those other guys couldn't be running their  franchises better.  I'm not saying that.  But you do have to have some sort of salary cap to somehow, like, how does the NFL do  it with Jacksonville? 
[01:10:30]  Like, what is that, nine people living there that actually matter?  You know what I'm saying?  I agree.  Somehow they can be competitive.  Maybe there should be a salary cap in baseball, but as long as there isn't.  They've been talking about that forever.  Oh, no, I agree.  As long as you do it to win.  Yes, I agree with you.  As far as that goes.  And you can't scream, you know, 2009, you can't say, oh, Yankees buy another championship  when they haven't, you know, they haven't won since 2000.  Well, no, that's the thing.  They should be fucking, instead of a parade every time they win, they should have a fucking  riot every time they lose, because they should win all, you have fucking embarrassed this 
[01:11:00]  city for nine years in a row.  There's nine years there that they probably should have had a couple championships.  That is a very good point.  They just spent $1.8 billion to get their next championship.  So, I mean.  So, it's one of those things where, you know, you can't, you look, you can't, you can't,  you can't buy a championship, but what you can do is you can buy the playoffs.  You can, you can definitely buy the playoffs.  And you can increase your odds, too, of winning the thing by getting, you know, the right  player, so.  My point yesterday, dude, was, was, what I was acting like was, was people were acting 
[01:11:30]  like it was this amazing accomplishment, and if you can fucking buy the best guy at every  position, in every position, it's, it's, it's not an accomplishment.  It's an expectation.  It's not.  It's like, why don't you get a team of eighth graders to play a bunch of fucking third  graders and be like, yeah, bitch, what's up now?  That's all I'm saying.  Like, I'm, I'm just, I'm talking about, like, they, they should do, whatever the fucking  NFL is doing is what baseball should do, and it would be a better league.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not bitching that the Yankees spent 200 million, but I'm just saying it gets fucking 
[01:12:00]  ridiculous after a while.  It just gets, it, it, it's been ridiculous for a while.  That's all I'm saying.  I'm not disagreeing, but I do think that some of these clubs could probably, you know, manage  their systems a little better.  And, and, you know, like the argument.  Are you just going to keep saying the same thing over and over again?  And now, like, add to your point, because I know what you're saying.  You're saying the same thing over and over again.  No, it's also got to do with the owners.  Like, some of these owners just don't feel like spending money for their team. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, there's some owners out there that have no business owning the fucking team.  I'm an owner.  Because they're not even trying to do the right thing.  Here's the thing, though.  If you live in Pittsburgh.  That's a good point, too.  If you live in Pittsburgh, do you understand how much $180 million is compared to New York  or Boston, what $180 million is?  Dude, look, look at how much a fucking, look at a fucking one-bedroom apartment in New York  costs 600 grand.  Like, the cash that is in this, that is in this, what is it now?  It's higher?  Okay, whatever.  So, it costs, still.  Close to a million, man.  You can buy half a million.  If you can't afford it, don't live there. 
[01:13:00]  You know what I'm saying?  So, no.  Oh, jeez.  No, I'm done.  I'm done.  You're not even listening to what you're saying, but I'm saying, dude, this is new  me.  This is new me.  When I, when this happens, I tap out.  I just tap out.  I go, you're not listening.  So, if Pittsburgh can't afford players, and New York can, how is that New York, how is  that, like, the Yankees' fault that they spent all this money?  Like, if you live in a market where you're not getting it.  It isn't you, you moron.  You're not listening to me.  I'm not saying it's their fault.  What I'm saying is, if you want to have a league where there's actually competition, you 
[01:13:30]  need to kind of spread it out.  That's parody.  That's where it could hurt the sport.  Dang, I'm just fucking with you.  Now you're making me feel bad.  You, like, start looking down.  All right, sorry, man.  Just eat your bagel.  Just try to help, man.  Yeah, he's just trying to help himself.  Just try to help himself.  I'll just eat my eggs and shut up.  No, it's, but in the end, the sport could be hurt, because if it's year after year,  like, the same four teams winning this damn thing, the interest is going to drop in the  sport.  That's all I'm trying to say.  You would hope in New York City, of all places, that, you know what, first of all, in a city 
[01:14:00]  this size where you have so much to do, baseball shouldn't fucking matter.  And if you've won it 27 times, the fans should act like they've been there before.  All right?  Fucking relax.  It shouldn't be that big a fucking deal.  The fucking Yankees!  Yankees.  If you have something better to do, it's fucking baseball.  It's a boring fucking sport anyway.  All right.  Well, America's pastime, Doug.  Yeah.  That's, yeah, according to their fucking press.  What's your sport?  I'm a football guy.  Hockey, man. 
[01:14:30]  If you're there live, it's fun.  Live hockey is amazing.  Get out of the Matrix.  Get out of the Matrix.  Go to hockey.  Yeah, live hockey is amazing.  They can't figure out how to make it look cool on TV.  Yeah, yeah.  Because the stupid puck is too small.  No, this is, but I can't stand it.  They've tried everything.  Here's what I can't stand all these fucking people who keep complaining about fighting  and hockey, and they want to get fighting out of hockey so that they can continue to  not watch hockey.  I've never heard a hockey fan ever complain.  Dude, you know what?  There's too much fighting.  I just don't enjoy it.  When I go to the Coliseum and a fight breaks out, fucking the kids stand up, too. 
[01:15:00]  They are fucking way into it.  Way into it.  Fantastic.  It feels like they're letting the fighting happen a little more the last couple of years.  Have you noticed that as a trend or not?  I have the NHL package, and I've got to admit, I watched like four games before I finally  saw a fight.  Really?  Yeah, I was just like, Jesus.  Huh.  That's why you've got to love the Flyers.  I love the Flyers because they remind me of myself, where it's like, I'll try to achieve  something, and I don't, and then I just continue to use the same method, thinking that I'm going 
[01:15:30]  to...  They basically beat the shit out of everybody in 74 and 75, won a cup, and they've been  trying to do that every year since...  Right.  Regardless...  Using the same strategy, even though the whole sport has changed around them.  Yeah.  There's no more red line.  Right.  There's all these European players in there that are still like, okay, get out there and  fucking punch that guy in the face.  Yeah, as hard as you can.  I love it.  The one trend in hockey I did notice...  Wow, we're going way too inside.  We'll get into some other shit in a second.  When guys get hit really hard, they have to fight and retaliate immediately instead of 
[01:16:00]  going, wow, that was a good, clean, fucking big hit.  Watch.  Every big hit now, there's a problem.  It wasn't like that when we were growing up.  No one wants to get hit that hard anymore.  I got a little distracted because I'm just looking on the screen.  There's something that says, one of the callers, his subject line is, Bill Burr is an idiot.  All right, here we go.  Let's go to Mike.  Mikey. 
[01:16:30]  Bill, you are an idiot.  I'm admitted an idiot.  I don't read.  I just start yelling and I hope people don't stop me.  We just watch the clock, make shit up and hope something sticks out there.  Yeah, this isn't meet the press, dude.  I don't know.  I don't believe in half the shit I say.  I'm like, all right, just say something.  All right.  Now, show me how smart you are.  Go ahead.  Okay.  If it's that easy to buy a championship, why do the New York Rangers suck every fucking  year?  We can't buy a championship.  Because only one time did you use the Yankees method of buying. 
[01:17:00]  Okay?  What the Yankees do is they go, who kicked the shit out of his last year?  Get their best player.  That's what the Rangers finally did.  They're like, who was the last dynasty?  The Edmonton Oilers.  And then all of a sudden they got Messier, Esatikening, and Craig McTavish.  They got the nucleus of that.  Kind of like the Yankees in the late 70s.  They got a bunch of Oakland A's on that team.  Like three or four guys.  But can we be honest with each other, too?  There's a lot of fucking luck involved in my favorite sport, hockey.  There's a lot of fucking luck.  Yeah, there's also like three months of playoffs. 
[01:17:30]  And then you got guys like Ulf Samuelson.  If your guy's better than him, he'll just blow your knee out.  You know, for some reason that's okay in hockey.  Right.  And people are like, yeah, I'll tell you, you hate the guy, but he was on your team.  You love him.  That's what they say.  There's some guy out there just carving out somebody's spleen.  You're like, you know what?  I really wouldn't.  I don't respond.  I could do that.  I could jump on Gretzky's fucking knee and end the greatest hockey player's career.  I could do that.  You know who my favorite hockey player was in the last 10 years? 
[01:18:00]  And he's not even one of my guys.  And I secretly cheered for him every time he played the Islanders.  Who?  Ty Domi.  Oh, you had to love Ty Domi.  Ty Domi was a guy.  He would go on the ice.  His whole purpose was to be a problem.  And he would go on the ice and he would just look at a guy and go, it's me and you.  As soon as they drop the puck, it's me and you.  And they would literally drop the puck and the gloves are off and now he's just fighting  this fucking guy because he had some weird issue with him.  The guy was shorter than me with skates on.  And he would fight.  No, he was tiny.  He would fight somebody. 
[01:18:30]  He was this little bulldog, man.  Ty Domi.  Who did he play?  His last team was Maple Leafs?  I think there's about 400 YouTube videos.  Ty Domi-verse.  Ty Domi-verse.  Everybody.  And man, I'd be at the Coliseum and people would be like, they want to fucking kill this  guy.  And inside I'm secretly going, God, I fucking love this guy.  One of my favorite clips on YouTube was when Ty Domi just blasts Ulf right in the face  and he goes down like a rag doll.  Like he knew he would.  Yeah.  He could fight.  He fought guys twice his size. 
[01:19:00]  He had no problem.  He would fight anybody on that ice.  Anybody, right?  Who's the guy who beat up and then he was doing like the wrestling, like the championship  belt thing?  As he's going off the ice with some fucking 10 game suspension.  I don't know.  Dude, I remember in the 80s, those guys, they would beat the shit out of somebody in the  other team's arena and they would go off the ice waving at the crowd, kissing their  fists.  Yeah.  Remember that stuff?  Just doing this?  All that shit.  I miss those games.  The biggest crime was getting rid of the bench clearing brawls.  No one really got hurt in those. 
[01:19:30]  I know.  You know, I actually went to a Bruins-Canadians game back in the garden where I actually saw  a bench clearing brawl.  Really?  It was one where Chris Nyland, they were taking him to the dressing room.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Look at this.  Oh, here we go.  Ty Domi.  Ty Domi.  There he is, Doug.  Now, he's getting his ass kicked by, I don't know which flyer this is, and then fucking  Domi will come back strong.  Always, always does.  Look at him.  He's like a foot smaller than the guy.  He just knew how to fight.  Sorry, Bill.  That's not Brashear, is it?  I can't tell that the video's grainy.  Yeah.  Oh, Brashear. 
[01:20:00]  Very good.  So what did you have?  I interrupted you, Bill.  Oh, here he goes.  Wait, he goes through the championship belt.  Oh, is this the championship belt one, Danny?  I don't know.  That's later in his career.  You can tell.  He fought right into his fucking last game.  Right into his last fucking game.  No, wait, Chris Nylund was walking by.  Back then, the opposing team to go into the dressing room had to walk by the Bruins bench.  So Chris Nylund walks by, and I don't know if Ken Linsman said something or what.  He pushed Ken Linsman. 
[01:20:30]  Then Ken Linsman chased him down, and a couple Bruins chased him down the hallway.  So now it was kind of three on one.  So then the Canadiens bench all emptied out.  It's in the breezeway or whatever?  The walkway or whatever?  Yeah, the walkway.  Oh, it was tremendous.  Oh, I got to check that out.  So, all right.  He's talking shit in the pedal.  Oh, yeah.  We're literally commenting on YouTube videos that people can't see.  I know.  But, I mean, if you're into fighting and hockey, just fucking do yourself a favor.  Spend some time with Ty told me. 
[01:21:00]  What a fucking animal.  Oh, you want another idiot call, Bill?  Let's say hi to Scott.  Scott.  I know about luxury tax.  I know about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, what the fuck?  Do you know what a little people call it?  Oh, come on.  Come on.  We're kidding.  That was a great point.  What the fuck?  You don't know about luxury tax?  Come on.  Stop.  The Red Sox.  What the fuck?  St. Louis.  What the fuck?  Dodgers.  What the fuck?  Give me some numbers. 
[01:21:30]  Give me some numbers.  Give me some numbers.  What the fuck are we doing today?  We're just getting everyone pissed off.  No, but that's what I love about it.  It's like these morons are calling me a moron.  Oh, come on.  Stop it, Billy.  Come on.  We're just pissing everybody off.  And someone's calling me a Judas.  Someone writes,  Oh, are you a Dale Hunter fan, too?  You fucking Judas.  I can't help it.  I have a guy like Ty Domi. 
[01:22:00]  I secretly wish the Islanders would pick him up.  I don't know if he would have even helped the team when he was in his prime.  Who knows?  All right.  Enough with sports.  Well, that's another thing that's hilarious about the Flyers.  It's like playoff time comes up,  and then they always end up picking up some goon off of Wavers  who you know is just going to, you know,  he's not going to score any goals.  What is he going to do other than get you to be like a man down, you know?  It's got to suck for that one guy, though.  His whole job on the team is to go out there and start a fight. 
[01:22:30]  Every team had one of those guys.  And as soon as you saw him on the ice,  you're like,  Oh, okay.  He's got to take care of somebody.  He wasn't out there for his stick handling.  Yeah, at what point?  Does anybody out there play minor league hockey?  At what point does it stop going from putting the puck in the net  to just beating the shit out of somebody?  Yeah.  Well, that minor league hockey is where the fighting is really still happening.  All right.  We're losing, Doug.  You don't give a shit about hockey.  Yeah, I have nothing to add.  Do you like blood?  I like fights.  All right, Stan Jonathan.  I'm a UFC fan. 
[01:23:00]  Look up Stan Jonathan when he fought Bouchard.  Speaking of UFC,  fuck it, it came out today.  I mean, it's a good segue for a quickie.  Fucking Brock Lesnar's not going to fight in January now either.  He's got mono.  How long does that last?  Well, he was supposed to fight, what, in November?  Canceling a fucking fight because you're sick two months from now?  And then he was supposed to fight in the pay-per-view in January, I believe,  but now he's not even going to be able to start training until December, 
[01:23:30]  so we're not seeing Brock Lesnar anytime soon because he deals with mono.  Well, still, it's fucking UFC.  They fight, you know, there's a title fight every fucking month.  It's not like boxing where, oh, yeah, maybe two years from now.  True.  But, I mean, I don't know about you.  I want to see Brock Lesnar as much as possible.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a fucking animal.  Yeah, no, I agree.  But if you have to wait four months, it's still not like boxing.  He hasn't fought a while, though, now.  Yeah, but the greatest thing about UFC is, other than that there's no weapons,  it's the realest kind of fighting. 
[01:24:00]  Look at that right there.  Sorry, we're fucking involved with hockey fights now.  We're in trouble.  Yeah, that was when I...  We're in fucking trouble, man.  Stan Jonathan, he was part Native American,  and he took out everything the white man ever did on Bouchard.  Look at him.  Look at his face.  Oh, fucking the blood.  Holy shit, the blood's just pouring out of his head.  Bouchard was actually a really good player, too,  and he said, you know, it was a shame.  I actually had a great career, and all I'm going to remember for is that fight.  That was the big one for him?  Yeah.  Wow.  And then there's big debates if it was the referee's blood or whatever. 
[01:24:30]  But anyways, getting back to UFC, that's what I like about it.  It's standing up, it's submissions, it's on the ground.  It's like professional, like whenever you got into a fight, for real,  it'd always be a couple of blows, and then you'd have the double headlock,  the double headlock, and then it would go down to the ground.  And these guys are like at a professional level of that.  And I don't know.  Those guys, they sit there on the ground just riding out the end of a round,  taking forearms to the head. 
[01:25:00]  Dude, one of those.  Career over for me.  Yeah.  Over.  The amazing thing with UFC for me is how they could get so much done  with only three inches of room.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  They're doing these weird little fucking just knuckle things,  and they could just damage you with no room.  It's weird that when you see a guy that's been doing it for 20 years,  and he's 44 years old, and he's still really bright and sharp in an interview  where you go, in boxing, you just talk to some fucking mumble mouth, 
[01:25:30]  and you're listening to Ken Shamrock saying,  well, actually, I'm trying to focus more on my economy of motion when I'm in the ring  because that way I can strengthen you going,  what the economy of motion?  Did you just say that?  Yeah.  Oh, Chris Simon was an animal.  All right.  We're finding all the animals now.  Hey, Danny, a lot of good stuff in front of me.  What should I hit?  Most patient cop ever?  Is that good?  Or a woman calls 911 because boyfriend won't marry her? 
[01:26:00]  If I have to pick one over the other, I'll go with the cop.  The cop?  Yeah, that's a good story.  Why is he patient?  We'll find out?  Yeah, you'll find out.  You'll definitely find out.  All right.  We got a nice little story about a cop that's...  This is the actual dash cam audio.  It's basically some guy got pulled over for a traffic violation.  Pretty standard pullover situation.  And this guy just would not cooperate, as you'll hear.  All right.  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around! 
[01:26:30]  Do it now!  Turn around!  Turn around and do it now!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Put your hands on your head!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Put your hands on your head!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Put your hands on your head!  Turn around!  Do it now!  I'm not f***ing having to you!  Turn around!  Turn around now!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around!  Turn around! 
[01:27:00]  Turn around!  Put your hands on your head!  Do it now!  Turn around!  Turn around and put your hands on your head.  Do it now.  Turn around and put your hands on your head.  Put your hands on your head.  Put your hands on your head and turn around.  Turn around and face away from me.  Get down on your knees.  Get down on your knees.  What the f*** is this about?  Turn around and get down on your knees.  Turn around and get on your knees.  Turn around, get on your knees, put your hands on your head. 
[01:27:30]  Do it now.  Just tell them what it's about.  I want you to tell them over.  I want you to know what the fuck it's about.  Turn around, put your hands on your head.  Turn around, put your hands on your head.  We'll talk about this.  Yeah, let's talk about it.  Turn around, put your hands on your head.  What's the problem?  Turn around, put your hands on your head.  All right, this is a great clip, man.  He's like, hear him in the end.  He goes, what's the problem?  Right, right.  Why would he, if he just answered him?  Dude, what the fuck? 
[01:28:00]  I can't be a cop.  Let me do this.  And that goes on for how long?  Do you have it right as a citizen to know what the problem is?  I would imagine.  I would imagine.  That goes on for almost five minutes.  Oh, no, that's only the first part there, Doug.  That's just a little warm-up.  That's the warm-up.  We just take a breather here and we talk about it a little bit.  There's only so much of that you can listen to.  Hence the frustration.  What the fuck?  Cops should have hit him one, no?  I mean, that's a great cop, man.  He really keeps us cool.  He should have fucking got back in the car and just driven off. 
[01:28:30]  Because obviously cops are not going to do shit.  Let's continue.  Get out of the car.  Get out of the car.  Stop driving.  Pull over.  Stop driving.  I'm serious this time.  You think he wants him to turn around?  Get off me.  Get off of me.  Give me back my gun.  Give me back my gun.  Well, it continues.  Do it now.  What did I do?  Do it now.  What did I do?  Do it now.  Tell me.  What did I do?  Turn around. 
[01:29:00]  Put your hands on your head.  Do it now.  What did I do?  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  What did I do?  Sir, I'm not messing with you.  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  I'm not messing with you either.  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  What did I do?  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  That is an order.  All right.  I need someone down the hall.  Whoever's got the raw audio.  Someone has to count how many times the cops said turn around.  I need to know how many times he actually said it.  That's an order.  I don't work for you.  Right.  Now the guy's trying to rest. 
[01:29:30]  He's getting mad.  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  That is an order.  Do it now.  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  Are you going to shoot me?  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.  Are you going to shoot me?  Turn around.  Put your hands on your head.

[01:34:30]  There's no way to emote any, any manly sound when you're getting tased, it's just, you know, I did that high pitched fucking squeal, did you hear him call him an asshole, did you hear him call him an asshole, yeah, he was an asshole, fucking A man, that's a great clip, Danny, yeah, I wasn't quite sure, I'm listening to it in the morning, I'm like, how am I going to play a three and a half minute clip of a cop just saying, turn around, what did he do, yeah, we never find out, I don't know the exact details, I just know, he's suing, hang on, hang on, he doesn't sound, 
[01:35:00]  drunk, he just asked a question over and over and over and over again, yeah.  I mean, it's hard to tell, you know, what's, what's true and what's not true, but apparently this guy was pulled over for, uh, I guess improper display of a, of a license plate. 
[01:35:30]  This guy, Mark Torres says, I still find it unbelievable that someone could get pulled over for a crooked front license plate and somehow ends up getting tasered six times.  I was pulled over for such random shit when I was a fucking young comic with a mullet and a piece of shit car, I would fucking, just ridiculous shit.  Yeah.  Uh, having a license plate light out and all they wanted to do is search your car, didn't make up any fucking reason. 
[01:36:00]  To pull you over.  Yeah, it's fucking absolute nonsense, driving too long in the left-hand lane on a fucking empty highway.  You can get pulled over for that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's, technically it's only for passing.  Again, there's always nonsense where they, well, uh, you, you did this, but we, now we want to search through your car.  Yeah, now we have a reason to look at your car.  Somebody sent me this great, this great video on how to get out of that type of shit.  Another video, Bill?  I can't, I can't remember, I know, right?  You spent a lot of, I thought I spent a lot of time on YouTube. 
[01:36:30]  No, that's what I do on the road.  I stay up till four in the morning, figure out who runs the world watching Ric Flair videos.  That's what I do.  What is, it's a video of how to get out of?  Well, you turn around and you start, you start asking the cop questions.  Mm-hmm.  And it was, uh, like this Jedi mind trick, and of course I forget exactly how to do it, but  it's just like, is there, what am I being pulled over for?  You get them.  Yeah.  Because basically, they don't, yeah, they don't have a right to search your, they don't  have a probable cause if you have a license plate light out, but they'll say stuff, do 
[01:37:00]  you mind if I check your car?  And that's when you're supposed to start asking questions, because they, they're asking, you're  giving them permission.  Right.  They need your permission, because they don't, they don't have a warrant or something like  that.  I'm really going to sound like a moron here, because I have no fucking idea what I'm talking  with, something like that.  That was the gist of it.  The problem is that now you're going to try to make them go, take the time to get a warrant  and act like they have probable cause if you say no.  Like, they tell you to.  And then that becomes probable cause.  Well, why don't you want me to search it?  Exactly.  Holy shit. 
[01:37:30]  All right.  Because legally, yeah, there are, well, you, it's my constitutional right, and you go,  well, you don't have any constitutional fucking right.  You ever get pulled over in the middle of nowhere and the cop doesn't even have, like,  the full uniform?  I get pulled over in, like, Colorado, right?  I'm flying, I drove, like, the wrong way for an hour, so now I'm, like, two hours,  you know, away from where I started.  That is the worst.  And I got, like, some fucking...  You want to cry.  Yeah, some awful gig in the middle of Colorado, and I came up over this hill and I'm flying,  all of a sudden this white Ford Bronco was driving right at me, like, right at me, and 
[01:38:00]  I'm like, what the fuck?  And I get over to the side, and I see, like, on the dashboard, he has the police lights,  and the guy gets out, and he's got the cop shirt on, tucked into, like, these Wrangler  jeans and boots.  Boxer shorts.  And he fucking comes walking up, what the fuck?  And Bob and Bob's screaming at me, and, like, the whole time he's yelling at me, I knew  I was speeding, but I'm looking at him, and I'm, like, going, is this guy, like, part  of, like, some Aryan fucking, you know, white power group?  Like, you don't even have the whole uniform?  They don't even have to even... 
[01:38:30]  You can't even buy, like, some blue dickies to go with that shit?  What did he get you for?  Speeding?  Yeah.  He just...  Screaming and acting like a fucking moron.  I was in the middle of nowhere.  And there's no one else on the road, right?  Yeah, well, they're going to hit a cow or a youth driving on the wrong side of the road.  Yeah, how about we all relax?  There's no one out here.  Who cares?  I'll only hurt myself.  Dude, but I went to this...  It's scary enough getting pulled over by a cop, and you're in the middle of fucking  nowhere.  You're like, this guy could just shoot me and put me in a ditch right now, and...  And come up with something.  He has enough time to dig a hole to even bury my rental car before somebody fucking comes 
[01:39:00]  along at this shit.  So you just got to sit there going, like, yeah, you're right.  I'm an idiot.  You're absolutely right.  You're...  That does go through your fucking brain, though.  He had on, like, a Cub Scout shirt.  Sean in Jersey, he's a police guy there.  What's up, Sean?  Okay.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Pretty good, man.  All right.  Well, you know, just so you guys know, the second most dangerous thing a cop can do is  a traffic stop.  More cops get killed in traffic stops, not by getting shot.  Well, did you listen to that guy?  Now you see why. 
[01:39:30]  He's annoying as shit.  You know, you got to remember, most of the time, I work for a large sheriff's office,  and I'm a sergeant, I ride alone.  So if I pull somebody over, I'm on my own until backup can get to me.  And it's not usually that far away, but I work in the city of Trenton, which is, you  know, if you know anything about Trenton, you know, a lot of high crime, a lot of gangs,  a lot of guns.  You're on your own.  You know, you're not going to take any chances.  You're not, you know, you're pulling somebody over and if, you know, dispatch or your computer  tells you that the person that should be driving the car, the owner has a warrant, well, I'm 
[01:40:00]  not going to sit there and play patty cake with you and, you know, make nice nights.  I'm going to tell you to turn around, put your hands on your head.  Well, if police departments weren't used so often as a form of random taxation through  nonsense like seatbelt laws and every other reason that you do pull people over, you wouldn't  be pulling people over that much.  Ergo, it wouldn't be that fucking dangerous.  Well, you know, it's, yeah, I can understand your point, but you got to look at it from 
[01:40:30]  our standpoint, too, is until you've been to that wreck where the kid's been ejected  from the car for not being in a seatbelt, you know, little kids all over the road, it's  a little bit different standpoint, you know, if we can do something to help protect those  people.  Well, then you can take that into the next step and we shouldn't even be able to leave  our houses or even drive cars.  We should walk to work and live in little fucking bubble wrap.  I don't walk in front of cars.  No, it just, you know, it's, you know, it's...  Look, he has to clean up the mess. 
[01:41:00]  So what he's saying is he's trying to prevent us from making the mess.  All right.  Exactly.  That's all.  I mean, if somebody kept spilling milk on the floor and I had to mop it up, I'd be like,  I'd pull over and be like, hey, put a little sippy cup in there because I'm really getting  tired of mopping this.  Hey, you know what I always wanted to ask?  Yeah, yeah.  When you guys go through, like, cop school, do they show you a bunch of videos of people  making bad stops so it scares the shit out of you or did just...  No, yeah, no, well, what they do is they show you a lot of videos of cops being killed 
[01:41:30]  in line of duty.  That's why.  Because I was always saying, like, I...  This is...  And this is me.  I'm not trying to disrespect police officers, but this is just in a moment of getting a  ticket and being yelled at and stuff.  And I always wondered, like, does going to cop school make you an asshole or do assholes  want to become cops?  I'm not saying that, like, it's true, but that's just, like, a feeling I had.  And then I was like, they must scare the shit out of these guys that, like, you have a 99%  chance of getting shot because that's how they seem to approach you.  Well, what they do, what they do is they train you, um, in all your training, what you're 
[01:42:00]  trained to do is overcome, like, whatever your obstacle is.  It's not run up and kick somebody, like, with some flying ninja kick and knock his teeth  out.  Right.  You're taught to overcome mentally whatever challenge is in front of you.  And the biggest challenge, obviously, is a life-or-death situation.  And what they do is by showing you things that officers have gone through, and they show you  a lot where officers are shot and live, where officers are involved in shootings.  Um, I have to tell you that the scariest one I ever saw was South Carolina. 
[01:42:30]  It was a South Carolina state trooper pulled over a guy, and the guy had a gun in his waistband.  They got into a struggle, and the guy shot him once in the arm.  The trooper returned fire and shot him five times in the chest.  The, the, when the, the trooper that got shot, 200 pounds, six foot tall, former Marine, perfect  physical condition, had four kids.  The bullet bounced off his arm and cut across, uh, severing, uh, his carotid artery and lodged  in his heart.  You actually heard him dying. 
[01:43:00]  What the fuck?  Yeah, on his dash cam, you saw him die.  You heard what he said.  He was screaming for help.  And when the trooper, backup trooper got there, a truck driver had stopped.  And in that state, he was allowed to carry a gun.  And he had a gun on the suspect, and the trooper almost shot him.  And the, the other truck driver said, no, it's not me.  It's that guy.  The guy he shot stood up.  Five times he was shot in the chest with a .357 Magnum.  So when you see things like that, and you're on your own out there, that's, that's horrible.  You feel like you're pulling over the Terminator at that point? 
[01:43:30]  We just all got sad.  Yeah.  I'm now sad.  The guy looked like Santa Claus.  No, it is sad.  Have four kids and take such a dangerous job.  Yeah.  And, and, you know, I was selfish.  I was on the SWAT team.  I was on the SWAT team for five years.  You guys are messed up.  No, that was Doug.  He's messed up.  What the fuck?  All right, wait, just to get off the depressing part, to go back to what Bill and I were talking  about, if someone, if someone, if, if you get pulled over by a cop and they ask to search 
[01:44:00]  your car, what do you say?  Well, it depends.  You know, in New Jersey, we have a lot of restrictions on searching a vehicle.  It has to be wingspan if it's in the nature of an arrest.  There's a lot.  And New Jersey is like one of the most litigious societies and like, it's like it's only a  fight for them.  There are a lot of reasons why I can't search your car, but I have to go.  What do we say?  What is the magic word?  Like, say, say I have my license plate light is out.  You come up to my car.  You say, have you been drinking tonight?  And I say, no, I have not. 
[01:44:30]  Or I had one drink.  And then you say, okay, can I search your car?  What do I say at that point?  You can say no.  Yeah, but.  And then what do they do?  Then they go.  In New Jersey, if I have reasonable suspicion to believe that there's like some kind of  contraband like narcotics or something like that in there, what I can do if she in New  Jersey, if the vehicle is going to leave the scene and take the evidence with it, then  that's edge against circumstances.  I can search your car.  So there's no way for me to get out of it.  No, there is.  There's plenty of ways.  Okay.  All right. 
[01:45:00]  Let's role play here.  You pull me over.  Now you say, hey, can you search my car?  And I say, no, you can't.  But why did I pull you over?  I mean, if it's just.  I had a little license plate light out.  Yeah.  I wouldn't.  I probably.  See, when I walk up to your car, unless your car looks like, you know, there's three bongs  and two dead midgets in the backseat.  Why would I search it?  Just because you're in a mood.  Your girlfriend or wife was giving you shit, right?  Because he's a black guy with dreadlocks and he's got a white chick in the passenger  seat.  So you don't like that shit.  Well, that doesn't mean anything to me. 
[01:45:30]  I live in Trent.  That's everywhere.  Who cares?  Um, I just, you know, honestly, just for a light out, you know, unless I smelled something  like, you know, burnt marijuana or if you appeared to be like you were so drunk, you  could barely keep your eyes open or you appear to be on something, I probably wouldn't want  to search your car.  Now, if, you know, I pull your car over and it's a high drug area and I feel that you've  maybe just purchased narcotics, then I'm going to go a little deeper and try and make  that happen.  All right.  So you say, can I search my, your car?  And I say, no, you can't. 
[01:46:00]  Then you go, all right, well, you're going to sit here until I get a piece of paper that  says I can't.  That's pretty much it.  Why don't you step out here with me?  We'll do some sobriety tests.  Meanwhile, I'm on the phone with my dispatcher.  Why do I have to get out of the car, sir?  Well, because I believe you've been drinking after you feel sobriety.  If you're a officer, you'll be under arrest.  What is this about?  I feel you're under the influence and you're driving impaired.  What are you doing?  Asshole!  I'm surprised Bill hasn't been tased yet.  You're one of the guys that should be tased, I'm thinking. 
[01:46:30]  No, I don't.  I'll do it.  No, when cops pull me up, when cops pull me over, this is what I do.  I put my fucking hands where they can see them so they fucking relax.  Yeah.  That's what I do.  I act like I'm stretching.  I have one hand on the stairwell and the other one's kind of like behind my head or what,  just so they can see.  Yeah, I keep my registration and insurance in the visors.  I never have to reach for any.  I keep my hands right in my pockets.  And make sure the music's nice and loud.  That old gag.  All right, Sean, enough.  We gotta go.  Thank you. 
[01:47:00]  All right, guys.  All right.  Sean from the New Jersey Police Department.  I'm a criminal defense attorney.  I can tell them when they can and cannot search your car.  Anybody on that?  Well, I think he just...  Yeah, he pretty much did, right?  Legally, that's the thing.  It's like when they try, oh, they're going to make torture illegal.  Oh, that'll stop it.  Yeah, it's fucking illegal for a cop to push you down the stairs and say you fell.  We'll go with this call.  Another guy that has a problem with Bill Burr.  Bill in Colorado.  Bill.  I'm getting pounded today.  Hey, Bill.  How the fuck do you go the wrong way in Colorado? 
[01:47:30]  Mountains on one side and Kansas on the other.  I had two schools that day, sir.  I was on like a three-school run.  I looked at the wrong school.  I had to get up at six in the morning and fly.  I was in a Dodge Neon.  I had a breakfast sandwich.  I went the wrong fucking way.  What do you want from me?  I don't live out there.  You don't need to live there.  You look.  Fucking mountains are huge. 
[01:48:00]  I was driving through the mountains, you fucking asshole.  Once you get in there, you don't know where you're going.  Do you think a guy with no cop pants was on the flatlands?  That's where all the normal people are.  You get in the mountains, it's hillbillies and rich people.  And what he means by going the wrong way, he went north instead of south or whatever.  I think this guy thinks you were actually on a one-way street going the wrong way.  Yeah, there's traffic coming at you the whole time.  Oh, is that what you mean?  I thought you meant like high.  No, no, no.  He means that he was just mountains on one side and Kansas is on the other.  He's talking like north-south.  All right. 
[01:48:30]  Thank you, Bill.  I love you, Bill.  I love you, too.  All right.  We done with this.  I was pulled over for not using my turn signal on my car search.  Ah, whatever.  It was a fun clip.  Now we're going serious with this?  Had a kid pull me over for a seatbelt and he was shaking and had his hand on his gun  the whole time.  And some would point out that it sounded like Sam when that guy was getting tased.  Yeah.  Let's have a party.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good place to take a break. 
[01:49:00]  I see Dr. Steve outside the studio.  Dr. Steve's going to...  You got any medical issues, Doug?  This guy knows everything.  I'm sure I got something.  You want to ask him a question, maybe?  Uh, yeah.  I'll come up with something.  Wait, really?  I got this fucking horrible, uh...  Wow.  What the fuck is that?  It's an umbilical hernia, I guess.  Yeah.  It's fucking...  That's pretty gross.  We can talk to him about that.  That looks like an eye without a pupil.  You got an eye where your belly button is.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  It's like Quato.  It looks like a closed eye, doesn't it? 
[01:49:30]  Kind of, yeah.  Quato.  Is that Lord of the Rings?  No.  Fuck yeah.  That's all we call it.  Yeah.  Oh.  I don't know movies.  I thought you'd be a movie guy, Bill.  I like the hacky guy movies.  I like Casino, Goodfellas.  I wasn't hacky.  Those are some good films.  I know, but I...  Every once in a while, I'll come up with a conversation.  I enjoyed.  Yeah.  You guys ever seen that, Gene Hackman?  Uh, no.  See?  That's why I don't talk movies.  All right.  Doug Stanhope is here.  He's going to ask Dr. Steve about his belly button. 
[01:50:00]  And then Dr. Steve's going to do something pretty cool, I think.  He's going to be fucking figuring out who has diabetes by, uh, tasting their urine.  Hmm.  That's how they used to do it in the olden days.  Are you telling me he's going to taste Doug Stanhope's urine and he's, he's not going to  get anything?  No offense.  You know what I'm saying?  How can you not just, like, drink people's urine?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  He's got it all figured out.  Yeah, I don't want to know if I have diabetes.  You know, like...  I don't really want to know.  I don't go asking a lot of questions.  You don't go to a lot of doctors, do you?  When we came, came up, you know, in the stand-up world, he, me and him basically started Headliner 
[01:50:30]  right around the same time.  And this fucking dude was such an animal.  I swear to God, like, for like three years straight, every gig that I did, it seemed you  were there the week before and had done something absolutely horrific in the comedy.  Stanhope was here last week.  To the comedy condo?  There was a midget and there was, like, something happened with the curtains or a pillowcase and  I was just like, oh, fuck it.  There were some midgets.  Those were the days. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah?  You had sex with a midget?  Yeah, I fucked a midget, but there was Alaska and there was, like, all these midgets up there.  You did coots.  Yeah.  Why is there a lot of midgets up there?  That fucking awful cabin they put you in?  Yeah, that's the worst.  Are they in hiding?  Unless you were Ralphie May.  They couldn't put Ralphie in there because the floors of this band house were so weak  that they couldn't put Ralphie May up and they had to actually get him a hotel.  Is that why?  Because he made it seem like he was like, no, I'm not staying there.  Get me a hotel.  And I was this young, wide-eyed kid.  Yeah, it was fucking liability issues. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, because he would really, the floorboards would almost fall through when he walked through  that fucking place.  It was that.  That bed was one of those beds, like, you just had to lay down in it and make it yours.  It was just fun.  You're just like, eh.  Dude, it was a little fucking.  Pages of jokes about them.  Just the fucking band house, like, so filthy the sheets had open sores and shit like that.  I just have soap.  I once pulled a bar of soap.  The cure for AIDS is in the rug under the bed.  I brought the soap on stage because there was a bar of soap that was covered with black mold. 
[01:52:00]  Where I actually had to bring it on stage.  I go, when you can grow mold on an antibacterial product.  That's bad.  It's absolutely the filthiest place ever.  Chill coot charlies.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to break.  So you got Doug Stanhope at comics this weekend, tomorrow and tonight.  Tonight and tomorrow, I should say.  And now we don't have to promote Bill.  I think it's a sold out show at town hall tonight, right, Bill?  Absolutely.  Very good.  I don't know what happened.  Sam went backstage to get to the bottom of Ann's trip to the hospital yesterday. 
[01:52:30]  So we...  Yeah!  So, uh...  We go to break with this.  Yeah!  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  On the Opie and Anthony show, Anthony told the audience that he recently had to bring a young lady he was seeing to the hospital.  Unfortunately, the young lady was a bit too young and was admitted into the pediatrics unit. 
[01:53:00]  We reached out to some O&A staffers to get their opinions.  Hey, Troy Kwan, how surprised were you to find out that Anthony had to take a woman that he was seeing to the pediatrics unit of the hospital?  I think it's great, man.  I think, uh, most guys his age are probably jealous of it, I would say.  Is that where you'd like to be when you're at his age?  Of course.  Yeah, absolutely.  I would think most guys his age are probably jealous of such behavior. 
[01:53:30]  Mars, uh, the girl that Anthony is seeing, um, she had to go to the hospital and she was admitted to the pediatrics unit.  Are you surprised?  Uh, was she a preemie baby?  Preemie baby?  Uh, I don't know.  Pediatrics, um, asthma, right?  That asthma problem, right?  Mars, are you reusing Opie's jokes?  I gotta go.  Where are you going?  Hey, Danny. 
[01:54:00]  Yo.  Are you surprised about Anthony having to bring the lady that he's seeing to the pediatrics unit of the hospital?  No.  No.  No.  Not really, no.  Um, is it something that you think he should be proud of or embarrassed by?  For a man of his caliber, I believe that you should be proud of such a thing.  Okay.  I mean, that is quite a feat, and I hope to accomplish that, uh, when I'm Anthony's age.  Good for you.  Next, we found Nicole from the morning mashup to get the female perspective. 
[01:54:30]  Hey, Nicole from the morning mashup.  How are you?  I'm doing okay.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts.  Today on the show, Anthony said that the young lady that he's seeing, he had to bring her to the hospital last night.  Um, and when he got there, they checked her into the pediatric unit, uh, which embarrassed him.  Are you surprised by that?  Well, how old is she?  He said she is of age.  Oh, dear.  You look sort of alarmed. 
[01:55:00]  I am alarmed.  This is a little, um, creepy and weird.  So if you were in a hospital with, say, a young niece or someone, and you walked into the pediatric unit with her and saw Anthony,  and he said he was there with his, uh, friend, would that, would that be something that creeped you out?  Uh, yeah.  It would, actually.  Um, yes, very much.  I think you should reevaluate the situation and, uh, make some changes.  Obviously, there's a difference of opinions on the matter. 
[01:55:30]  All we can do is hope that Anthony's friend makes it out of the hospital okay and gets a sucker for being such a good girl.  I'm primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  You have eight new voice messages.  First voice message.  This is a fake fuck you, just shut this, down in Philly.  Now I have to get up an hour and a half to two hours earlier every day to drive my wife to work 
[01:56:00]  because you assholes want more money than the average pay of $52,000 a year.  Just piss my ass and fuck you, Deathly Union.  Next message.  I'd like to give big F.U. to all my stupid-ass co-workers who seem to want to sit on their ass and play solitaire and surf the internet  while I'm busting my balls trying to take care of this friggin' job.  So you know what I got to say to all you, all my dumb-ass co-workers?  Fuck you.

Call the Opie and Anthony FU line, 866-FU-LINE-1. 
[01:58:00]  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you, and goodbye.  Thank you, and goodbye.  Oh, absolutely.  Opie and Anthony.  Actually, Opie and Bill Burr.  And Doug Stanhope.  Dr. Steve outside the studio is going to come in and see what the fuck's going on with Doug's belly button.  I always went out when I got, I asked my doctor. 
[01:58:30]  I have a doctor just for his scripts.  He's like some 80-year-old dude at the fucking clinic at the foot of my street.  And so I get my Ambient and my Xanax.  Yeah, I have fear of flying and trouble sleeping.  And he's like, yeah, whatever.  So I always go in just to refill a prescription, and then I'll throw shit like this in as an aside  so it's not on my permanent record if I ever want to get health insurance.  There's no record that I went in for this.  I go, oh, by the way, since you're filling a script, wait, what's this belly button? 
[01:59:00]  That's real fucked up.  It's an umbilical hernia.  You don't do anything unless it's bothering you.  Did it appear out of nowhere, or you had it your whole life?  No, no, I always had kind of an Audi, but then it's just gotten bigger,  but I thought it was because I'm getting fatter.  Then people started to recoil from it when I had my shirt off,  and I go, oh, maybe I should get that checked out.  Maybe it's more than an Audi.  I don't know.  I've kind of grown with it, so it's like cancer.  If you check every day, you don't notice it.  It's a lump. 
[01:59:30]  Doug drove the break.  Doug was cracking us up, and I actually told him to stop telling the story so we could...  I don't even remember what it was.  The fucking TV be gone thing and what you did.  Oh, yeah, some dude handed me this after a show.  We have eight TVs in here.  All of a sudden, they started going off.  I'm like, what the fuck's going on?  Doug's like, oh, it's my TV be gone.  Yeah, someone gave it to me.  I just found it, and there's a jacket where I go, oh, fuck.  It's supposed to be a universal remote that'll turn off any TV, and someone gave it to me,  and I'm at the Kansas City airport just trying it out in the fucking sports bar, and it's 
[02:00:00]  not turning off any TVs, and then I'm walking through the terminal, and I just aimed it at  the fucking...  Turned out the giant departure sign, the TV that had all the fucking departures, and then  I'm like, oh, fuck.  And then I wanted to turn it back on, but I'm going, oh, shit, they might be watching  on camera to see why that TV went out.  I don't want to be fucking aiming a remote at it to turn it back on.  I just love the name of it, because you really are like a god.  TV be gone!  Yeah, you're fucking...  Someone's watching fucking Nancy Gray somewhere. 
[02:00:30]  Is she ever in a good mood?  Oh, she's awful.  Is she ever telling just a feel-good story?  I've never been able to watch that show.  I just see her face, and I'm like, ugh.  Those eyebrows.  It's a rough face to look at.  They always got to do that...  They do like that Jim Rohn sort of side look, you know, like you're about ready to admit  to something you don't even admit to.  Dude, I'm just watching your show.  Why are you looking at me like that?  Hey, I don't know if this plays, because we're past it now, but some Tidomi audio that 
[02:01:00]  they found.  Oh, beautiful.  You gutless...  You touch Housley, I'll fucking take your head off.  Fuck you, you all!  Fuck you, you all!  What the hell is this Weiner, I think he is? 
[02:01:30]  Who's strapping balls on him?  Shaggy!  Steve, hold this.  This is Evan, and I trusted Evan.  I was like, I should probably listen to it first, but I was like, Evan, is this good? 
[02:02:00]  He's like, yeah, yeah, it's really good.  So I'm like, I'm going to trust Evan and just hand in the disc.  He sucks.  It's like listening to Scarface if they put it on TBS.  I can give up.  And I specifically asked him, I said, I was like, okay, why should we play this?  He goes, oh, no, he's talking shit.  It's really good.  It's really good.  Evan, that sucked.  That sucked.  Okay, here we go.  Evan has gained a reputation.  I'm sorry, Danny.  I should have alerted you.  I didn't know this was happening.  I have a pile of CDs.  That's not how I talk. 
[02:02:30]  I have a pile of CDs in my office that Evan has given me, deeming these would be great  for the air.  Not one of them are.  None of them.  This is Evan's specialty, is pulling audio.  Yeah, did you notice that it was like every other word was beep?  Yeah, I couldn't find any unedited.  Why did you give it to me?  I wanted you to listen to it.  And why wouldn't you edit it down?  There was just a lot of static and nonsense in there. 
[02:03:00]  You could just cut out of it.  Well, because he's also no good at instructions.  He started handing me CDs with a two-minute news story in 14 tracks, none greater than seven  seconds long.  So I said, Evan, what is this?  And he goes, well, I thought that's where they would stop to talk.  And I go, if they want to talk, they'll stop it.  Just, you know, regular clips.  Right.  I stop it when I feel like it's a good point to stop it.  I was like, listen to the show.  I was like, think about how long the clips are.  He goes, okay.  So then he starts handing me two-and-a-half-minute-long clips. 
[02:03:30]  I go, Evan, there's no comfortable medium?  I think I got the swing of it, eventually.  No.  Well, today, with the exception.  Today.  The hang of it.  I got the hang of it.  I'm in the swing of things.  I think I got the swing of it.  It's like combining shit.  That's not a phrase?  No.  Why does half the staff talk like cartoon characters?  Yeah, he really does have some kind of trumpet thing happening.  Well, no, I thought, I mean, I don't know.  I know they might be past it, but I mean, I thought, he's talking shit. 
[02:04:00]  I think it's pretty good for the show.  I mean, I couldn't find him on anything.  I was hoping that Danny, I was hoping that your professional ear, Danny, would listen  to it.  Well, I figured I used poor judgment and decided to trust you.  Yeah.  You've only been here nine months.  You decided...  I don't know.  The second track is better.  You didn't just do that to yourself.  Phil, you want to hear the second track?  Oh, yeah.  I trust him. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  He's in the swing of things.  We're all sitting here uncomfortable going, what the fuck are we going to do with this  audio?  I'll preface it with it.  He's in the penalty box arguing with someone else in the penalty box on the team he's playing.  It's pretty funny.  You know what I mean?  Because I like it.  You can't listen to the song.  We're going to move you to the Ron and Fez show.  That's a perfect place for you.  The last person that did that was Frankenberry.  Yeah.  Tell Ronnie.  Hey, I'm Doug.  It's nice to meet you.  Hi, Doug.  How are you?  Good.  That's Evan.  You like to meet you?  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking someone's going to be on his side. 
[02:05:00]  Mob mentality.  Fucking blood in the water.  Piranha pricks.  Wait, is this the first time you're doing our show?  This is how it goes.  I don't know.  I just thought I'd be...  High lawn.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Grab a seat.  Do you think I usually yell at old ladies?  I don't.  One gets in here and somebody starts trashing.  That's how it goes.  Tell Ronnie good news.  We've got a new guy for him.  He's going to be very happy and excited.  He loves the new guys.  When we send him his way.  All right.  Here we go.  Ty Domi in the penalty box.  Evan says this is good. 
[02:05:30]  Is it better than the first one?  It's better than the first one.  Oh.  Well, I thought the first one was good, but I was wrong.  I was wrong.  I was wrong.  I didn't get it.  Why?  People make stacks of fuel.  I mean, what do you do?  He does a pretty good, Evan.  Yeah, he does.  You have to give him that.  I don't care if I win one. 
[02:06:00]  That's not f***ing to me.  I don't care.  It's right for my team.  I'm not like you.  You're selfish.  Want to go soon as we get out?  Razzle dazzle?  Holy shit.  That was pretty good.  That was good stuff.  That was all right.  I make twice as much as you.  That's such a f***ing UPS worker thing to say.  Like, it's like such a, like just f***ing average Joe lunch bucket. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, why f***ing me?  Brendan Walsh.  Do you know Brendan Walsh?  This f***ing wicked funny Austin comic.  He was doing that on stage where he yelled at some lady.  He goes, hey, f*** you lady.  I make $80,000 a year.  Just randomly like he doesn't.  Just because it's such a douchebag thing to say.  But that guy's actually saying it and meaning it.  I make twice as much as you.  Want to go soon as we get out of there?  A little razzle dazzle? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, he didn't care about the game.  Zach at Jersey.  Bill, do you remember when Ty Domi beat the s*** out of the Philly fan that fell into the penalty box?  Supposedly one of his greatest moments.  I don't know this one.  Oh, yeah.  Some fat f*** screaming down at him.  And then the glass collapsed.  Is that on YouTube?  It'd be like teasing like a f***ing alligator or something at the zoo.  You're like, hey, you f***ing piece of s***.  And then all of a sudden you land on its head.  Oh, f***.  That's basically what happened.  I want to thank Zach.  I did not know about that one.  Yeah, he falls in.  It doesn't get too, too crazy. 
[02:07:30]  He hits him a couple times.  They always have, for some reason, the penalty box to keep things safe, they always have  like a 90-year-old white guy, like a World War I veteran.  In a sports jacket.  Yeah, he's a sports jacket.  Old sports jacket.  Eddie Shore is in there with a toupee.  He's a f***ing Walmart greeter.  The interns are just, they want in on this.  What's that about?  Every intern, like Evan is the least liked of all interns.  I would disagree with that.  I would disagree with that. 
[02:08:00]  I don't think that's true.  Oh, I've seen this clip.  I'm sorry.  I have seen it.  The fan falling into the penalty box.  It's on YouTube.  It's a classic.  Paul, you want in?  Oh, he won.  Oh, God.  Well, I see them hanging outside the studio.  They want in bed.  What do you got on Evan there, Paul?  Well, Evan's work speaks for itself, obviously.  The second one was good.  Can you get some Skynyrd intro music?  Give me back my boys.  You kind of got that look now, Paul. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  More than ever.  It's pedophile long at this point.  I've got to cut it soon.  All right.  So, you have a problem with Evan?  I can't say I have a problem with Evan.  Sorry.  I can't say I have a problem with Evan.  Evan, he's just a fucking idiot and thinks he's great at everything, and that's the only  real problem I have with him.  Evan, comment?  Well, I'm not a fucking idiot.  I don't know about that.  I mean, if my work speaks for itself, I guess I'm only an idiot half the time. 
[02:09:00]  I mean, they're like one of them.  Paul is very inflammatory towards me.  Why?  What's the problem Paul has with you?  I don't know.  I can only...  Is that Paul with the long hair?  That's Paul.  Just getting everyone straight.  That's cool.  Doug Stanhope.  Isn't inflammatory a medical term?  No, he's a correct usage.  Well, that's another thing with Evan.  He takes these words that he would use to sound intelligent and throws them into a sentence  where they have no business being. 
[02:09:30]  He did that yesterday, right?  Yes, on Wednesday.  No, wrong.  I actually...  Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  He said Paul was diluted instead of delusional.  I prove that.  It's actually correct.  I used the usage of the word correctly.  Evan and Paul, they used the usage correctly.  He's almost right.  He's just so close to right.  He's using inflammatory remarks.  Well, the worst part is he'll go back...  Sorry, I didn't mean to... 
[02:10:00]  No, go ahead.  He'll go back and spend an hour online trying to find the right context of the word in the  sentence that proves his point.  Meanwhile, by the time he brings it back, like everything he comes up with, it's always  five or ten minutes too late and no one cares about it.  I don't know.  Evan?  Yeah, that happens a lot.  That happens a lot.  Yeah.  I'm trying to work on that.  Yeah.  They argue for...  Who were you angry at this morning, Steve?  I'm not Steve.  Oh, whatever.  Paul.  That's Paul.  Whatever I just said. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, Paul.  When we walked in, you were yelling at someone going, thanks, you got me yelled at.  Oh, one of the other interns fucked up the breakfast.  Oh, that wasn't him.  No, that wasn't actually Evan's fault.  All right.  All right.  Should we get that guy in here?  No, it's not worth it.  It's not worth it?  All right.  So, are you guys all right?  Oh, yeah, we're fine.  No, they're not all right.  They'll talk about this in-depthly after the show.  For the next two hours?  In-depthly.  Yes, in-depthly.  It might be the dumbest collection of people. 
[02:11:00]  I'm including myself.  It's the dumbest collection of people.  All of us.  It's just a bunch of idiots.  All right.  I guess that's it, right?  Yeah.  They'll bicker for an hour and a half.  Just throw them out.  So, Evan, the audio almost worked.  Okay, good.  If you would have led with the second clip, we would have had something.  At least I learned a valuable lesson out of this whole thing.  It's to never trust Evan again.  Oh, that's not good.  You should listen to what I give you.  I'm not a professional.  I will never trust your word ever again.  I like that he admits that he's not a professional.  That's good.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  No, I'm learning, though.  You're getting better every day.  What have you learned?  Nine months later, and you still suck.  You're not getting better every day.  Oh, my God.  You tell me I'm not improving?  Jesus, Sam.  Are you being serious?  Yes, because he does this all the time.  He gets much, much worse, and then he gets a little better, and then he gets worse again.  And he thinks that that's consistently improving, not taking into account that he's getting worse,  and then getting better, and then getting worse again, and then getting better.  So it's not an improvement from where he started.  I don't know how much worse I've gotten.  A lot. 
[02:12:00]  A lot.  Paul says a lot.  Well, Paul, I mean, Paul will take any shot at me that he can, because in my opinion, I feel he's threatened of me.  Every intern is jumping up and down outside the window.  Does Nick want in?  Yes, Nick wants in.  Did you hear he said he's threatened of me?  By me.  Most would consider Paul the superstar of the lineup there.  Evan would not.  I know.  It's not that Evan's stupid.  He's very silly. 
[02:12:30]  Evan is definitely very silly.  I am a little silly.  Very silly.  In what way?  Just that he pays too much attention to detail, to things that don't need any detail,  and then the things that do need detail, no detail whatsoever.  Evan's the type of person who says, listen, Sam, I want you to know something.  Starting next week, I'm going to put my best foot forward.  I'm going to be in five days a week for the rest of the summer.  Nice.  And the first week that he said that, he was in two of the five days. 
[02:13:00]  And one of them he just no-showed.  No phone call, no nothing.  One, he came in late.  Evan's constantly, like, he takes one step forward and two steps back just daily.  Evan, he looks stupefied.  That is his best foot.  Evan looks stupefied.  I think this might be a little embellishment.  Hold on, someone's got, uh, Jeff in Virginia.  Jeff.  Oh, fuck.  Hold on.  Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.  Try that again.  I didn't have, uh, the phones up.  What's up?  The Earth brings through the space modulator. 
[02:13:30]  Marvin the Martian, a little bit?  A little bit.  All right, we've got to wrap this up.  Anybody else want to beat up Evan?  I don't know if it was mentioned, but Travis has a fantastic Evan impression.  Travis does?  It's, it's spot on.  Travis?  I don't really know what everyone's talking about.  Sometimes I'll do my Evan impression.  Sam, I think, can back me up.  Didn't Evan have to take a week off once?  Yes.  To recuperate? 
[02:14:00]  Yes, at one time.  Yes.  Evan was having a really...  We don't compete up here.  He was having a bad week in the sense that he was doing nothing well,  and he was getting nothing done, and just showing up a mess.  He shouldn't have even showed up.  So, he said, I'm gonna, I said, you said you're gonna come in five days a week.  How about next week, five days a week, and we start anew?  And he said, I will start anew, but I'm gonna take a week off to get myself together,  and then start coming in.  What did you do during that week to get yourself more prepared for your job here? 
[02:14:30]  I guess rested.  Evan has a very bad problem with...  He has terrible sleeping patterns, and he'll take absurd amounts of Adderall every day  and sleep maybe three times a week.  He does take 60 to 100 milligrams of Adderall every day.  For what?  Well, apparently I'm afflicted with...  ADHD.  ADHD.  But he's developed such a tolerance for Adderall that he has to take massive amounts.  What the fuck? 
[02:15:00]  What is ADHD?  It's like ADD, but they add hyperactive in the middle of it.  Obviously.  Where's Dr. Steve?  You want him in here?  Steve, you here?  Evan, that's really no excuse, because every...  I didn't say it was an excuse.  Attention deficit hyperactive.  I didn't say it was an excuse.  Evan also enjoys taking Paul's credit card and buying everyone lunch with him.  Yes.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was a great day.  That was a good day. 
[02:15:30]  Dr. Steve.  Yes, sir.  Evan's got something called ADHD.  Yes, he does.  Yeah.  You can tell just by looking at him.  How much Adderall can one man tolerate?  Huh?  No, I listen to the show.  All right.  Yeah.  And you can just tell?  Yeah.  Is he taking too much Adderall?  What dose did you start on?  That would be my question.  20 milligrams a day.  And they worked you up to 60?  Yeah.  To get you where you are today?  He takes up to 100 a day.  Yeah, some days I take more. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  It's an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  And it's weird that you can give those people who are hyperactive stimulants and they actually calm down.  And it's more to do with being able to focus than anything else.  So on the higher doses, he should be able to focus better.  But presumably his doctor is a pediatrician.  I don't know how old you are.  No, I get it from a psychiatrist.  Okay.  So you get it from your psychiatrist. 
[02:16:30]  So, you know, that's amazing.  Bill was on to some, though.  So you took a week off to get your head together and you just rested?  Did you do anything else?  Well, I mean, I was often staying up two, three days in a row to accommodate.  Let's keep in mind so everybody's clear.  Evan is here three days out of the seven-day week.  Right.  He's not a full-time, like, this is a really tough gig thing.  Right.  Well, at the time I had school to accommodate and I'm just traveling back and forth.  Getting over to New Orleans a year.  School and an internship.  Wow.  Who's ever heard of that?  Well, and also, I know. 
[02:17:00]  What else were you accommodating?  It seems to be a nice word for you.  Myself, personally, if I go to sleep, let's say, at 9 or 10 o'clock, it's going to be  very difficult for me to wake up to get here.  So I figure I just stay up that night and then come in at the right time.  It's difficult for everybody to get up.  Yeah.  So he comes in on zero sleep and he's zero productivity.  Everybody's got an alarm clock.  Oh, those don't work anymore.  They just incorporate themselves in my dreams. 
[02:17:30]  What do you mean they incorporate themselves in your dreams?  Well, I'd be dreaming and then the alarm clock would be off in my dream.  Right.  And I just think it's part of the dream and not wake up.  Yeah.  I actually understand that one.  Yeah, I understand that.  But you guys understand that for real?  You dream that you woke up.  But after a while, you realize, fuck, if this is reality, I got to, all right, your fucking  girlfriend's yelling at you and then she's going, ah, ah, ah, you're like, shut the fuck  up.  How long in your, how long do you dream about the alarm clock then? 
[02:18:00]  I mean.  As it's going off.  It won't wake me up.  It's just as long as, uh, however long my dream lasts.  For hours?  I mean, yeah.  Evan, uh, is a very, he's a poor sleeper.  He once didn't show up to one of the Saturday night shows that he promised he would.  And I found out it was because he was sleepwalking and completely trashed his room and his parents  thought he was addicted to drugs so they kicked him out of the house.  Yeah, that was a problem day. 
[02:18:30]  How did you talk yourself back into the house?  Uh, well, I mean, eventually that my parents just felt guilty and wanted me to come back  in, but I fucked the place up.  Your own room or the whole house?  No, just my room.  Like, I pulled all the drawers out, clothes everywhere, I was breaking lamps and shit.  I had no, I don't even remember it.  I just woke up and it's just shit everywhere.  There's a hint of private pile in this kid.  Oh, yeah.  You see it in his eyes.  I tried, dude, does your emotion when you, when you're in, when you have a problem day, 
[02:19:00]  as you say, do you flip out, do you yell at all, or do you just sit there, they're telling  you to get the fuck out of the house, do you still kind of have this monotoned, even-keeled  way of speaking?  Yeah, I don't really raise my voice that often.  Well, that's not exactly true.  No, it isn't.  No, I drive them in two to three times a week, and, uh...  Wrong, again.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Okay.  It's not the kind of voice you want to raise.  Two, two max.  I tend to, uh...  Two max, but you're here three days?  Yeah, and I drive him the other day. 
[02:19:30]  Incorrect.  All right, Paul, go ahead.  No, I tend to need 11 a little bit on the way home because, uh...  Well, I like bringing it out of him.  I feel he shouldn't go home angry, so I try to get it out before he gets home, and he  loses his fucking mind.  I don't go home angry.  He makes me angry on the way home.  Why?  In what way?  Because he's frustrated.  I like how you're trying to act like you're helping him when you're being addicted.  Oh, no, thank you.  I just feel he shouldn't bring that anger home with him.  What the fuck does that mean? 
[02:20:00]  So I'll bring it out on the way home.  You just enjoy...  You enjoy him getting mad.  Absolutely.  How does he bring it out of you, Evan?  He has his mindset that he's being completely, uh, uh, uh, altruistic and helping me and  trying to...  Was that a good word, Doug?  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  I really don't know.  Altruistic.  Yeah.  After further review, the word stands as call.  Altruistic.  You were impressed by that one?  Yeah.  That went flying over my head a bit.  I had to go chase that word down.  I'd throw it back into the infield.  I lost that one. 
[02:20:30]  Holy shit.  Okay, yeah.  His perspective is that he's...  has a mentor role to me and wants to bring out my potential, but in actuality, he's just  being a needling prick.  I wasn't trying to help you, though.  No, you're not.  Evan was once punished because he was having so many bad days that he had to spend a week  calling Paul daddy.  Yeah.  Which, uh...  That's the relationship that they have.  Hey, Doug Steve, should we do some scream therapy with Evan?  You know anything about scream therapy?  I don't know if that'd work.  You want any other medications, though? 
[02:21:00]  No.  Really?  Yeah.  Let's go on.  Does your psychiatrist know about these bad days and the anger?  Oh, no.  I tell him just everything he wants to hear.  Yeah.  That's the problem.  Is this some kind of court-ordered?  Psychotherapy?  You know, the psychiatrist office is the one place that you can be completely honest  where they really, they're trained not to judge you.  You're right, but I really don't trust this guy.  He just wants to give me as many drugs as he can.  He's like, want some Ambien?  Get some Ambien.  Xanax?  Want some Xanax?  Sure. 
[02:21:30]  I think it's...  No, that's...  You know what?  That's what they do.  He's right.  He's right.  That's what they fucking do.  No, no.  If you have a guy just prescribing you drugs, you're exactly right.  He's exactly right.  They did that to...  ...on his notebook, yeah.  They did that to my mother.  Fuck all of them.  I'm with Evan now.  Yeah, so I just get my Adderall and I'm happy.  Right.  And you tell him what he wants to hear.  Why don't you get the other shit and sell it?  What I did at first, and then I realized that I have poor self-control and just ate  a lot of those extra toasts.  Ate of all the profits.  Yeah.  He wants to eat Xanax and pass out for two days. 
[02:22:00]  I just...  I woke up one day, ate some Xanax, and then just lost the whole day.  I woke up, it was midnight, and I had no idea what happened.  Yeah, man.  I try to do that with as many days as possible.  He can't control himself in front of pills.  Yeah.  Like, if you place pills in front of him, he'll have to swallow them.  He'll have poor self-control, which will lead to a problem.  Let's go.  Yeah.  I'm starting to get into his speak here.  I like this.  It will exacerbate my...  ...my Adderall.  Let's have some diarrhea pills just later on. 
[02:22:30]  See if he takes the bait.  You want to scream, Evan?  What do you want to do?  I want to hear him get angry.  Evan, get some of the frustration at Paul.  Paul is making you look like an asshole.  On the air now.  He does.  Evan, constantly.  You're a fucking failure.  That's all you are.  It's not true.  Christopher Walken there.  It's not true.  I feel like there's a giant balloon next to me and you guys are poking pins at it.  I'm the one who's going to have to be on the front lines.  We'll make room for you over here.  I have a pretty high threshold. 
[02:23:00]  Evan, what did Opie say when Paul came in?  He said, it's pretty much known that Paul is the star intern.  That's because that's the idea that he's given everyone.  Not that these other guys, there's some other fucking good players.  But Evan is bottom of the pile.  No.  Agreed.  That's the perception that Paul puts out there for everyone.  That's right.  That's exactly what he does.  And you're going to get away with it.  He likes to walk around like he's in charge of shit.  He is.  Telling people what to do.  But he's not.  He is.  He's not.  He seems like he is in charge.  I had the interns rate all of us this morning and you were on the bottom of everyone's list. 
[02:23:30]  From new guys.  From everyone.  Doug, I'm sorry.  You were at the top of your own list.  Everybody else put you at the bottom.  I liked you.  Just remember.  I just thought about your folly break.  Remember, I was on your side.  Don't worry.  This is what they do behind the scenes, though.  While a radio show is going on, they have all these little games they play with each other.  It's amazing.  Why don't you have it out with Paul right now?  I want to hear you get angry and stick up for yourself.  Yeah.  You ever fantasize about slapping the bandana off the top of his head?  All the time.  Then do it.  I can't do that shit.  Oh, shit. 
[02:24:00]  Okay.  Because it's unprofessional.  And who's going to give you a ride home, right?  I drove today, so I'll be giving myself a ride home.  Evan, Paul has effectively made you look like an asshole, made himself look like the king of the interns.  Yeah.  This would be your opportunity to set things straight.  Now, if you're not going to do it, it's not going to get done.  Paul, I don't see him do really that much productive work other than giving the rest of us interns a hard time and answer some phones. 
[02:24:30]  Paul's very nice to me.  I know.  I don't know what it is.  I think what a sweetheart to me the entire time I've been here.  Now, Matt, that's not true.  And you know that.  Angry, Matt.  Angry.  I remember.  That's angry.  Angry.  Evan?  Yes, Matt?  Just because you want to be me doesn't mean you have to get mad at me.  I don't know.  What?  Wow.  Why would I not be you?  Just because I get stuff on air and I'm productive and I'm not sitting in front of a computer for  four hours.  I get things on air, too.  That's why.  Yeah.  Like that great hockey fight.  The second one was good.  The second one was good. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  And I've also wrote two or three promos that have been made to rotation.  That no one will let you do the production for because you're horrendous.  Or the voice.  Well, that's a little exaggeration.  Well, my voice is horrendous.  I'll agree with you in that respect.  Evan.  I don't know how the argument is.  You've got to stand up for yourself on this one.  Could you have like a 15-second tirade or something?  Yeah.  To Rod.  Tell him how you feel.  Yeah.  Just get it out.  But on a loud level, though.  I mean, I don't know how to articulate it.  Paul's flaws. 
[02:25:30]  Okay.  Let's go here.  Flaws.  Paul's flaws.  He will consistently run and tell.  Passion, Evan.  Passion.  I've got to get worked up.  Get me worked up.  Stop testifying.  Yeah.  Let's go.  It's not like you're testifying right now.  Paul's got everybody fooled that he's the greatest.  That's right.  So tell him why he's not.  He thinks you suck.  What he does.  Evan saying yes to everything isn't a good argument.  Oh, look at that.  It's a pipe down a little bit.  He's owning you right now. 
[02:26:00]  That's because he's my bitch.  Brian Holtzman.  That's wrong.  That's who he reminds me of.  You know Holtzman?  Yeah, yeah.  I hope he snaps like a little bit.  That's what we're hoping for.  He likes to take his...  He's a bit older than the rest of us interns.  He has a more grizzled, intimidating appearance.  And he likes to...  He comes off as better than you.  Yeah, he does come off.  I don't know why the fuck he comes off.  Because I am. 
[02:26:30]  No, because he goes around.  Why does he do that?  Let's go, Evan.  Let's go.  I hope he thinks he's better than you.  Let's go.  Much better.  Everyone thinks he's better than you.  Any little misstep, any of us will, well, particularly me, and he'll go telling everybody,  oh, fuck, hey, why don't you ask Evan what about this happened?  Doesn't he ever make a misstep?  Yeah, he does.  Like what?  Like what?  Well, you know what?  I try to have a little...  Oh, it's not a misstep, Evan.  Come on.  No, because I can't think of a particular example right now.  Because it doesn't happen.  Because I can see you're in the booth the whole fucking day.  Yeah, working.  It's quiet for calls. 
[02:27:00]  Is that hard work?  No.  So I have to get all that credit.  Paul, get him going.  Make believe this is the ride home.  Because you said you get him going, and he gets fucking going.  Evan, do you realize that today you came in here and did nothing but make Danny look  like an asshole?  Oh, yeah.  Just sitting there and being like, yo, this is great.  Put it on the air.  We should have listened to it.  Oh, so it's fucking Danny's fault then.  Oh, wow.  I told him to listen to it.  No, it is my fault.  I absolutely should have listened to it, but I chose against my best interest.  I knew. 
[02:27:30]  I was like, let me trust Paul.  Paul has not exactly a proven track record with good audio.  But I was like, he seems to be this adamant about this, but Jay, I'm going to trust him.  And then you let me down again.  Yeah, don't mistake us, please.  Yeah.  Am I going, Paul?  Yeah.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Because everybody's got Paul in their mind because they think he's the best.  I'd much rather think about Paul than you.  All right, Evan.  I mean.  Unless you're going to fucking stick up for yourself.  We're done with this.  Evan, this is another notch in the failure column.  Yeah.  I don't see how this is a failure.  I consistently, going out there, I'm trying to pull shit. 
[02:28:00]  Most of it's garbage, but I'm out there trying to do it.  And I see him doing nothing.  So, dude, do you want a fucking E for effort?  How about you actually do something right?  What have you been responsible for getting on the air?  I made an intern piss himself once.  And who did that?  Me.  I pissed my pants.  No one else.  All right?  So, your crowning achievement here in the almost 10 months you've been an intern is urinating  yourself in front of a bunch of men to prove a point that you didn't piss yourself. 
[02:28:30]  I'd say it was my crowning achievement.  Hang on, Matt.  That was his crowning achievement.  One of my favorite Evan moments is we made him, I forget why we made you do this, but  Evan kept saying that he could eat a Pop-Tart really fast.  So, we made him get Pop-Tarts and heat them up.  And he ate burning piping hot Pop-Tarts as fast as he could and he burnt his mouth.  That was impressive.  That was definitely my favorite.  The thing about Evan is any type of...  Like, he'll fail constantly, but he just won't accept the fact that he failed.  So, he's just like running into brick walls constantly, then just backing up and running 
[02:29:00]  into them over and over again.  Evan, you got different brick walls.  You got guys that have been here way less time than you.  Kicking your ass.  They're talking about how much of a failure you are.  I like Evan as a person.  As a co-worker.  Yeah, doesn't cut it.  Not so much.  He's very iffy.  I don't see how I fail.  You know, maybe because I take more chances.  So, there's going to be more failures.  Wrong.  Wrong.  There you go.  There you go.  Absolutely wrong.  Evan.  Let's end by what have you done, Matt Bryan. 
[02:29:30]  Damn.  Damn.  Watch out.  Matt has a tendency of getting angry.  Jump in whenever someone's getting shit on.  You come in and you give me a little two cents.  Yes.  Because usually, the stuff that I put out gets on air.  Why don't you fuck it?  And people actually enjoy it.  And they enjoy me on it.  What the fuck do they enjoy?  Oh, every fuck.  No, no.  The past couple of FU promos, the wow promos I've done, all the shit you've done piles up  on Sam's desk.  Well, those are your stories that I find that are...  Yes.  And they go nowhere.  Like your life is going.  Some of them have gone there.  I feel like Matt just stays at home and writes arguments down for the day that he has to bring 
[02:30:00]  them in and just remembers.  I have nothing else to do, Nick.  You are honestly correct.  I have no life outside of this.  Yes.  Very angry.  Yeah.  He's very perturbed always.  I need a hug.  Evan, we're done with you.  Evan, all they wanted was a tirade and they didn't get it.  Yeah, what are you going to say to this?  What's happening here?  Another failure from you?  This was all a waste of time because there's no tirade from Evan.  Yeah, what's our big...  Go ahead, Paul. 
[02:30:30]  Now it's Evan's fault that we can't make Evan snap.  You want me to put it in terms of...  He failed by not being weak enough and caving under the pressure.  Why are you tearing down the wall?  What an asshole he is.  How dare you, Evan?  With the Keith Moon haircut.  That's you.  Is that me?  I'm sorry.  Yeah, that's John Densmore's sideburn.  Another error.  That's where I am, I believe, right?  Yes, I'm the newest intern here. 
[02:31:00]  Okay.  And within two weeks of being here, people are already telling me I was doing a better job than Evan.  No, Paul was.  Paul is telling you.  What?  Paul, well, who's in charge, Ev?  Paul is.  What?  Paul, you're not in charge of shit.  What?  What you'll do is you'll tell all the other interns that come in, guess what?  Who's garbage?  Evan's garbage.  Who's the guy?  Me.  Is that right?  No, it's not right.  And I like to have a little, uh, uh, uh, uh, more respect and, and more positive. 
[02:31:30]  Earn it.  Earn it, you'll get it.  No.  You know who's earned my respect?  But I'm calling with, I don't go around, I don't go around telling the rest of the  guys, hey, guess who's shit?  Paul.  Even though he is, I, I don't do that, though.  I let everyone make their own decisions.  No, you don't.  You, Evan, you influence all of them.  You don't, you don't go around telling everybody how big pieces and shit they are, but you  go around saying that you're the greatest thing since sliced fucking bread, and that  your output doesn't match your ego. 
[02:32:00]  So does Matt.  I can't eat bread.  I'm on a diet, thank you.  You're on a diet?  How old are you?  20.  You should be on a diet at 20.  I've lost 40 pounds.  I'm very happy.  I have noticed.  Thank you.  A little slimmer.  Well, I've explained my mindset before.  I think and say that I'm the greatest because I have to, I keep that going to keep my drive  going.  That's my motivation.  Evan, do you realize that if one of the bosses comes in and says, hey, you know what, we 
[02:32:30]  got some money rolling in.  Yeah.  We got some, you know, we, we have a position open.  And who's your best intern that you wouldn't enter any of the people in this room's mind?  Not one.  Evan has a lot of strategies.  Once, uh, Rob Cross was, uh, he said, I work very hard around here.  Well, what, what does Ray Romano have to say about that?  Well, that was, that was one of your crowding days, Ev.  That was a good day. 
[02:33:00]  But, uh, no, because I, I, I like to, uh, uh, does everyone want to say something positive  about Evan?  Thank you.  Thank you, Doug.  I'll say something positive about Evan.  There you go.  Uh, you know, we, we rip on Evan a lot.  He is, he is a bit of a dolt, but.  Wow.  We, we, we, we love him for the fact that he's such a mongoloid.  Wow.  The fact is he provides so much entertainment for all of us.  And we, we're always laughing at the crazy stuff he says. 
[02:33:30]  What do you do, Graham?  What, what, what?  I do a lot more than you, Evan.  What?  Whoa!  What do you do?  I'm, I'm, I'm call screening two days a week.  I gave, I gave in some audio to Sam today.  I give Sam audio all the time.  Yeah, but your audio is diarrhea.  Not all of it's bad.  And it all, no, you said to me, 95% of it.  To be fair, uh, Graham's audio is also bad.  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, at least I'm handing in audio.  I am too.  I, I will say that I'm the most prolific out of everyone here.  Prolific at failing, of course. 
[02:34:00]  Listen, the more I hand in, the better chances I get of something is going to be good.  That's right.  All right.  So tell them.  I do tell them, but you know what?  Paul over here.  Well, point at him and tell him.  Paul over here, the fucking, he, he just destroys anything I build up and he'll do that consistently.  So then you destroy him.  He's coming over here.  I'm just getting closer to you.  Don't get intimidated.  No, because I don't, I'm not going to play those dirty games.  That's right.  What dirty games?  You just completely, what you do is you like to put down everyone around you to make you look better by comparison. 
[02:34:30]  Nick, do I put you down?  Uh, no.  With the exception of Nick, for some reason, Nick is like.  You used to, but now that I've, now that I've earned my keep around here, I don't need to get insulted as much.  And I haven't earned my keep around here.  No.  How?  Yes, I have.  Have you not been listening for the past 45 minutes?  We've been tearing you apart.  Oh, wow.  But I, I come here.  I output decent work. 
[02:35:00]  I have my failures, yes.  But every one of those is a learning experience, and I build upon each one of those.  But, uh.  Say it.  It's pretty good, actually.  Go, Evan.  Uh, uh.  Yeah, and I don't know why, uh, it gets shit on.  I'm, I have my strengths, and I know them.  I'm good with technology.  Technology.  Uh, and audio.  And those are my strengths.  When it comes to content, uh.  Wait a second.  I am looking right now.  This is like a Vegas look-alike.  You got Michael Moore, Dwight Yoakam, and the fucking Keith Moore. 
[02:35:30]  I mean, this looks like a Vegas, it's fucking unbelievable.  Yeah, you guys are in the wrong business.  You can make a lot of money.  You should be standing on Hollywood Boulevard in front of Ben's Chinese Theater.  They're the baby versions.  Yeah, they are.  That's baby Michael Moore.  Michael Moore.  The baby Archie's, whatever the fuck it was.  Jesus Christ.  Don't you think he looks like Michael Moore?  Yeah.  He's got a touch of that.  Yeah.  No, he's got more than a touch, yes.  I'm so glad I'm on a Republican this year. 
[02:36:00]  I just want to point out that Evan has completely forgot whatever argument he was just making.  Oh, wow.  He makes you look like an asshole.  What were you just saying?  What, about how I output here?  I output a lot of good stuff, all right?  And I do a lot of work.  I don't think that's a verb.  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't you try using the word produce?  Whoa.  You know, because you're trying to be a producer.  Why can't I use output?  He's going high, bro.  Why can't I use output? 
[02:36:30]  He's dictating what you say.  Output would be a noun.  Evan, remember what Sam told you on Wednesday?  Jesus.  Sorry, Doug.  I didn't hear you.  No, no, no.  Remember what Sam told you on Wednesday?  He told me a lot of things on Wednesday.  What did he tell you about today?  Oh, that I can't fail today?  And what would happen if you failed today?  I would have another week of calling you daddy.  Okay.  What is that about?  Evan needs to learn.  I see potential in Evan.  He doesn't call you daddy.  It's more shit.  It's Paul. 
[02:37:00]  You have to call Paul daddy?  It's garbage.  I know, but it happens.  Well, I mean, if he fails, it's garbage.  Why do you have to do it?  Well, Sam says so.  That's exactly right.  Sam, tell him to get mad.  I can try to tell you.  You have no idea they're all pet your fantasy.  I've worked up right now, and I don't know.  I don't really get too much higher than this, unless you physically threaten me.  What's that, Matt?  Just don't pet your pants again.  It's embarrassing for all of us.  Wow.  I proved a point that day.  What?  That you didn't urinate yourself in a bar? 
[02:37:30]  That's right.  That is fucking the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  That is the most asinine.  Oprah asked me to piss my pants, and I obliged.  You know how dumb that sounds?  What?  That I helped out the radio show?  That you urinated your pants over an audio medium.  Damn.  Well, it was on YouTube, and there were pictures.  But still, it's just a stupid thing to do, Evan.  You would have done it.  No, I wouldn't have, because I have somewhat of a self-respect for myself.  If I asked you to pee your pants, you wouldn't have done it?  That's Michael Moore with Andrew McCarthy's voice. 
[02:38:00]  Never heard that one before.  I'm waiting for this to go somewhere.  Yeah, we're trying to figure out what it is.  I'm going to die of a fucking umbilical hernia while you guys...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Evan, you have to take this somewhere.  All right, Evan, how about we do this?  Because I don't know what to do with this fucking segment.  Fucking wrap it up.  What do you want to say?  You've heard a lot of voices today.  Paul is a big...  Paul puts on a big facade that he's in charge, he's taking care of shit, but he really isn't. 
[02:38:30]  All he does is give the rest of us a hard time making him look like he's doing work, and better by comparison.  All right, go down the line.  What about Keith Moon?  Yes, I must say...  No, no, Evan is talking about you.  Oh, Evan's talking about me?  Yeah.  What do you got about Keith Moon?  Grandma has a fucking attitude problem, number one.  And the day he comes in here, he's immediately with the disrespect.  No thanks to fucking Paul here, saying, no, it's okay, it's fine.  And look at his intimidating fucking appearance here. 
[02:39:00]  What are you talking about?  If I looked like him, I'd fucking do the same shit.  I look like a skinny guy on his shirt.  Now when you put on your face...  No, I know what he really is.  He's a big pussy.  Whoa!  He constantly threatens physical violence on me.  He'll never do it.  Thumbs up or thumbs down?  I can't make that call. 
[02:39:30]  Go ahead, punch me in the face, you big pussy.  What?  Do it.  It's not worth it, Paul.  Don't do it.  He'll never do it.  Stop killing the bitch.  He'll never, ever do it.  Shut up, guys.  Shut the fuck up.  Have you learned anything from us?  It's so worth it.  Punch him in his face.  It's like the little rassets.  Come on, do it.  I got the one nod that...  What?  What?  Sounds like, Evan, sounds like somebody's making excuses of his own.  I think so.  And I got like this with him before, so what he did is he did the, I'll punch you in the 
[02:40:00]  shoulder kind of hard, so I'm sort of serious.  I'll punch you in the face, just so you watch, but you won't.  You won't do it.  No.  Oh, no.  Evan, I'll catch you on the street.  Don't worry.  No, you won't.  I'll beat you in this and then make you drive me home.  Okay, do that, and then there's going to be a nice little civil suit that you're going  to have to do with.  You're a fucking faggot, dude.  Am I?  That's how adults...  react. 
[02:40:30]  They don't fight.  If they get punched in the face...  No, the difference is a man will fight, and a little boy will call the cops.  An ignorant man will fight.  An educated man won't.  First of all, there's not an educated man in this fucking argument, all right?  Yes, me.  I know that, Bill.  A civil suit.  Oh, God, somebody throw a puncher, let's just get on with it.  You're boring me, and I'm in this argument.  Now punch me in the face already.  Ooh.  I know.  He's a big, tough guy.  He's like, oh, I've been over in a hundred bar fights, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:41:00]  I'm a scrapper.  I know how to fight.  He hasn't been in one, I'll bet.  How many is it?  I don't count that shit.  Yeah.  All right.  Because he fights so much.  Zero.  Evan, go on.  Yeah, come on.  You've got three other guys, and then we're wrapping up.  You get the last word here.  What about Matt?  Matt references people that nobody's ever heard of constantly.  Uh-huh.  And he puts a tag on almost anything anybody says.  What does that have to do with my input to the show? 
[02:41:30]  Oh, I didn't know that that's what I was talking about.  I thought it was just general problems.  What is his reference that no one gets?  No, he'll just reference people.  Like who?  I couldn't tell you because I have no idea.  So how does he even know that I'm making references that no one else will get?  Because you say names that I or no one else here have heard of.  If you had to make soft prom night love to one of these interns.  Let's make this, let's keep this positive.  I like that, yeah.  If you had to.  Who would it be, Evan?  If I had to? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  You have to pick one.  Go into fat kid with glasses.  I do have the nicer ass.  Yeah, but you've been whining the whole time.  Well, pardon me.  I'm not an experienced party bottom like yourself.  Oh, party bottom.  I'm going to go with Nick.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  You win.  You win.  Evan wants that second.  So you got that going for you.  And Evan, what about Nick? 
[02:42:30]  I generally like Nick.  He just shit all over you.  I don't know, but he doesn't bother me really that much from Nick.  Thanks, Evan.  Nick, he comes, he has funny lines.  This is true.  He's generally a hard worker.  Correct.  I like what he's been doing.  Oh, thanks, Evan.  What about Nick?  Why?  I didn't know that this was shit on Nick and not shit on Paul.  No, this is no fucking payoff from you ever.  Yeah.  And if there is, it's always ten minutes too late.  I'm a very easy target. 
[02:43:00]  What payoff have you brought?  I like to hear what...  You did fail at punching him in the face.  I'll have to.  Well, I got the nod.  I looked.  I made sure.  You got the nod.  Yeah.  What, permission to punch me in the face?  I would play getting thrown out of here for your useless ass.  Whoa.  Oh, shit.  That's useless.  Your ass is useless.  All right, we're going to wrap up because I don't know what got accomplished here.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Wow.  Evan.  All right, Evan.  All right.  She still hasn't justified his own...  I think he's stirred enough of the waters that maybe in a couple hours by a vending machine, 
[02:43:30]  he'll punch him in the face when no one can see it.  He won't do anything.  And it'll be an awkward girl punch.  And then I have a recorder on me at all times.  We'll see what happens when he thinks we're alone.  What the fuck?  He's a psychopath.  I love it.  All right, we got to take a break.  Do you have any more spots in that?  How can I do that?  Matt, I hope he's trying to go to break.  Fine.  Why don't you guys continue in the hallway like you do every day?  Well, I have a little taste of what happens every day with these guys.  All right. 
[02:44:00]  Thanks, guys.  Doug Sandhoff is going to be at Comics tonight and tomorrow.  Bill Burr is at Town Hall tonight.  And after the break, Dr. Steve, right?  Yep.  You're going to look at his fucking belly button?  Absolutely.  All right, we'll do that.  Absolutely.  And you're going to do the diabetes thing?  Sure.  Yeah, old-timey medicine.  All right, you'll explain after the break.  Absolutely.  And a horrendous track of Yoko Ono singing on Jimmy Fallon.  It's got to be played today.  So still lots to do.  Opie, Bill Burr, and Doug Stanhope, and Dr. Steve today.  Hey, Bill Burr, question. 
[02:44:30]  Have you heard about this pennystockchaser.com website?  Why, no.  No, I haven't.  Could you possibly tell me more about it?  I sure can, Bill.

Do you have any more information about that?  I sure do, Bill Burr.  Did you know that every month, dozens of these small-cap penny stocks explode in price?  Why, no, I didn't.  Doubling, tripling, or more in a matter of days? 
[02:45:00]  Tripling?  Come on.  Oh, that's true, Bill.  It's true.

Oh, fuck, you had to jump ahead again?  Yeah, I got a little more info.  Please wait before you tell me how I get involved.  Do you have any more information?  Well, Bill, I'm glad you asked.

[02:45:30]  Can you imagine turning $2,000 into $20,000, Bill?  Wow, that would be something.  Could you possibly tell me?  How do I get involved?  There's my line now.  No.  Can you tell me more?  Oh, can you tell me more?  All right, I'll tell you one more thing.  Jesus Christ, this is over-sale.  They got their hot pick of the day, RGTX, which has moved from $0.12 to $1.38.

The first couple ad-libs were good, and then the last one sucked, and I was just like, 
[02:46:30]  I don't know.  PennyStockChaser.com.  PennyStockChaser.com.  That's right.  You know, that's the kind of craps I play.  I go to the nickel.  Yeah?  Yeah, over at O'Shea's.

[02:47:00]  Wow, memories, huh?  We'll have to talk about that in a second.  Hey, Bill, you like your ACDC box set you got in front of you?  Unbelievable.  Even just how it looks like an amp is cool.  It not looks like an amp.  That is an amp, my friend.  What do you mean?  One amp of power.  Yep.  You can listen to the box set through that. 
[02:47:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  You like your guitar.  I swear to God.  Are you serious?  It's only an amp, but, yeah.  It's one wad of power.  One wad, I should say.  Right.  One wad of power.  The ACDC box set.  It's like an old fucking...  Holy shit.  Yeah.  How cool is that?  I was going to give that away to a friend of mine.  Now I'm not.  Hell no.  Keeping that for myself.  Thank you very much.  The ACDC box set is really cool.  What is it?  Rarities, all their shit, DVDs, a little of everything, right, Danny?  Oh, there's tons.  You've got CDs, there's an LP, there's like a huge coffee table book going on in there. 
[02:48:00]  It's really cool.  We should give one away.  Definitely a must-have for any ACDC.  We've got our phone number up on the pad data somewhere.  Sure do.  All right.  Just call that number.  We'll give a random caller the ACDC box set.  Very cool.  All right.  And for those of you who don't win the box set but you still want it, you can find it  at acdcbacktracks.com.  Strong.  The collector's edition is three CDs, two DVDs, and one LP of rarities.  Okay.  It's pretty cool.  Cool.  That's for the people that sat through the break with us.  Thank you.  Dr. Steve, how are you, buddy? 
[02:48:30]  I'm well, my friend.  How are you?  I'm well, my friend.  That's very out of the problem.  Another cartoony voice.  Can't help it.  I have ominous news.  I hate to tell you this.  Did you look at Doug Stanhope's belly button?  No.  I don't really.  You know, here, it's just an umbilical hernia.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it sure is.  Can I touch it?  Yeah, sure.  Is it reducible?  Yeah, it squishes in, if that's what you mean.  Okay.  Yep, that's what I mean.  When did you first, was that not gross to you?  Yeah.  At what point did this become? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, can I touch it?  Like, that was the last thing I would have.  Like, that's the last thought that would come into my head when I saw that.  Were you once an intern like Evan who went,  Ew!  And like, you're fucking everything up, man.  Don't go ew when you're touching a gross belly button, man.  Yeah, they pretty much beat that out of you the first year of medical school  because you start working with a cadaver.  It's the mere fact that he's alive.  The mere fact that he's alive makes it not gross.  Wow.  So is there anything, could anything go wrong with this? 
[02:49:30]  I'm assuming you were born, we normally see this in babies.  Okay, yeah, I know when I was a baby they had to like tape a half dollar over my belly button  and it's always been kind of an outie.  Yeah.  So, but yeah, it's getting bigger as I get fatter.  Yeah, absolutely.  Basically what it is is there's abdominal muscles there that are supposed to be knitted together  and there's a little defect in there and then the fat from under there will work its way through  and then become sort of this balloony looking thing called an... 
[02:50:00]  So this will continue to get bigger and bigger.  It can over time and also if you get bigger yourself that defect will get bigger.  All right.  And the only thing that you worry about is if you start getting intestine in there.  Because if you get intestine in it and then it twists, then that part of the intestine can die and then...  And then you'll fill up with shit and explode.  You're next, yeah.  All right.  Really?  That's a...  So can we pop that shit?  No, no, no, no.  No, you don't want to pop it.  No, it's my guts forcing their way out of my belly button. 
[02:50:30]  Fuck, Doug.  You've got to take care of that, I think.  Yeah.  It can be fixed surgery.  Can we call Bill Burr's father?  Linger longer?  Yeah.  A little call back?  Could your father take care of this one, Bill?  No.  I don't think he's trained for that.  So now, like, would actually, like, getting better abdominals, would that help or hurt it?  Like, doing a sit-up, would that actually help strengthen it?  Or would it force more guts through my belly button?  Although I'm usually in favor of vigorous exercise, this is one case where if you did 
[02:51:00]  a lot of abdominal exercises, you're increasing the pressure on the other side and it will  push through.  So you'll notice that if you do sit-ups, it'll be more prominent.  All right.  And it's probably not really doing it.  So I should do no exercise whatsoever is the best way to treat this.  I'm just saying it'll make it more prominent.  This is the doctor that I'm always...  How much would that operation cost?  Like, what, $785 million at this point?  No, I'm thinking about $3,500 if you were paying cash.  But I'm not a surgeon, so... 
[02:51:30]  Can you pay cash and keep it off your record?  Is there a way of paying?  Well, what do you mean by keep it off your record?  Give them a fake name.  Like, hey, yeah, I'm fucking John Doe.  What's it your business?  I'm paying cash.  There will be a record of it, but whether it's searchable or not, that's a whole other  thing.  Like, yeah, if...  I don't need an ID?  They've got to make a record of it.  Like, I don't need to, like, show a passport to get surgery?  You pretty much...  I mean, the protocol is that you go in, you show your ID, and you give them your insurance  information and all that stuff. 
[02:52:00]  If you don't have insurance, you know, they'll still get your Social Security number.  Now, do they check it?  Why is that any of their business?  I've never figured that one out, to be honest.  Because they're doing all this shit in Costa Rica from now on.  It's one number that identifies everyone, so we need another number is what we really  need.  Yeah.  Can you say Harvey Dent can be trusted?  Harvey Dent?  Batman.  Let's go.  Yeah, what about him?  You sound like Batman.  Say Harvey Dent can be trusted. 
[02:52:30]  Yes.  Catwoman!  What the fuck is going on?  Bill's embarrassed for you.  He never gets embarrassed.  Bill.  I was just hoping someone was going to get that reference and start laughing.  Are you really going to drink piss to see if someone has diabetes?  Is that...  Yeah, actually, no.  Well, he's going to do a little dipstick thing.  Yeah, we're going to do a dip...  What, do you want to talk about him?  Is that George Clooney is Batman?  I'm trying to say...  Oh, it's fucking Christian Bale. 
[02:53:00]  When he does the...  Oh, I was doing the Adam West.  Yeah, he's way more Adam West than...  Yeah, no, I thought...  I saw the Adam West.  I hear a little Christian Bale when he goes deeper with the voice, too.  Oh, Harvey Dent can be trusted.  Okay, now I get it.  All right, we're so on the wrong page.  We're thinking of two different Batmans.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  So, before we move on...  Don't get...  Don't get that taken care of as soon as possible? 
[02:53:30]  Oh, no, not necessarily.  He's all right for a while?  My doctor said, if it's not bothering you, don't worry about it.  Yeah, if it's not growing, it's not bothering you.  You're not having any pain with it.  You have any of those things.  It bothers other people.  It doesn't bother me at all.  It's not that bad, really.  No, it's not bad.  And it's totally reducible, so I'd leave it alone.  Now, if it ever gets to where you can't reduce it...  Where I can't push it back in?  You can't push it back in, then...  My guts are hanging out.  I can't get them back in my stomach.  It's all going so cold.  Johnny, I can't feel nothing in my legs! 
[02:54:00]  That would be an indication to get it looked at.  Yes, it would.  I don't want to...  Yeah, enough of my belly button.  If you're going to drink piss, I don't want to slow up the parade.  Okay, yeah.  I want to see...  No.  Are you sure this isn't just something he's into?  I can drink piss and see if you have diabetes.  Dude, you can bukkake me and I can tell your sperm count.  Fucking your pal Joe Rogan has been drinking pee all over the fucking place.  He didn't do it on our show, though.  A little mad at Joe.  Oh, really?  Yeah, fucking Joe rules, you know, but he went on... 
[02:54:30]  Drinking his own piss?  Yeah.  When he comes in here, he didn't do it.  I'm like, what the fuck, Joe?  Why is he doing that?  I read an article on it.  It's supposed to be really good for you.  Is that true, Dr. Steve?  I don't think so.  I mean, I hear that's where all the vitamins are, so you put them right back.  No, here's the thing.  It'll grow your hair back.  The reason there's vitamins...  People are just saying shit and people are like, really?  They're dumping their own piss on their head.  Just from saying that on the air, there's going to be at least one guy that does it that's all fucking so afraid of balding. 
[02:55:00]  It's waste products.  I mean, the reason that there's vitamins in your piss is because your body didn't need them, so you pissed them out.  So why force the issue and re-drink it?  Doesn't your body go like that?  That's what I'm saying.  It's crazy.  And there was this boxer that just fought recently, and that was part of his training, was that he would drink his own urine because he wanted to, quote-unquote, reclaim these vitamins.  And the thing is, just take a fucking vitamin.  That'd be really fucking cheap.  Thank you.  I'm not wasting vitamins, not when there's good ones in my piss. 
[02:55:30]  I didn't use all mine from yesterday.  You can buy a bottle...  You know how much these things cost?  You know, there's a recession.  You can buy a bottle of one a day for, like, a buck.  Your mother making your drink piss so you save on vitamins.  It's in China.  You're a kill for that piss.  Look at how yellow your urine is.  That means this is chock full of vitamins that are perfectly good.  Don't give me that face.  Dr. Steve, by the way, is in New York to do his radio show live, which is cool. 
[02:56:00]  Weird Medicines on Saturday, tomorrow night?  9 p.m.  9 p.m.  9 p.m.  9 to midnight?  9 to midnight.  Very, very cool.  You kids are going to sit there until you drink your urine.  No television.  Get the egg timer out.  Yeah, you've got to drink it.  Remember that shit?  Your fucking legs were falling asleep when they had something.  My parents had a rule.  Whatever you didn't eat for dinner, you had to eat for fucking breakfast.  We had that for a while.  Everybody else is eating waffles and pancakes.  You're trying to cut through some cube steaks.  Spinner, I guess.  Cube steak. 
[02:56:30]  Fried rice.  Sam has no...  That fucking cold tendon.  Cube steak, yep.  Sam has no concept because, you know, he had the perfect fucking parents growing up.  I met him.  Yeah.  He didn't make you do any of this shit.  I cleaned my plate.  Have you ever sat at the fucking dinner table for hours after everyone else left because  you couldn't finish your fucking meal?  I never had to do it for hours, but I had to clean my plate on occasion.  A lot of our parents were sick fucks.  That's torture.  Have you ever thrown a tuna casserole behind a bookcase and then tried to say that you ate  it?  No. 
[02:57:00]  Days later, it starts smelling.  And then your mom takes the paddle that your dad, for some reason, saved from his fraternity,  aims for your ass and hits your lower back?  No, I didn't.  That's too visual.  Yeah, there you go.  I think that might have happened to Bill Brown.  No?  No, I used to hide...  We had to figure out how to fucking Houdini your own fucking food?  I used to hide vitamins, daily vitamins.  Where'd you hide them?  Drawers.  In your drawers?  You were out of control, man.  That's crazy.  I got a little crazy when I was a kid, but I'm over that now. 
[02:57:30]  I've met his parents, trust me.  Perfect.  They've got the perfect family.  Perfect parents, and yet he's a psychopath.  Yeah.  Well, he's a psychopath, yes.  He's not a psychopath, man.  All right.  Well, so Dr. Steve's doing his show.  Bill, he's got a good radio show, Doug.  Weird Medicine.  Yeah, it's fun.  It really is.  It's fun.  Because people call up with the most fucked up shit, and he has a way of dealing with  it and making it interesting and kind of funny and shit.  How do you find those doctors that are like, you know...  Well, when I was telling you, like, they have, like, the stem cell crystals that's not even, 
[02:58:00]  like, approved.  Yeah, you find them on the internet.  Because some of them are nuts, and some of them, there may be something there.  You know...  Anyone you can recommend?  Any rogue guys?  Any rogue.  That you can say on the air?  I'm about as rogue as I know, to be honest with you, because...  You've got the rogue voice, dude.  You definitely sound like...  Do that.  Yeah, we're going in.  I mean, this is...  No landing lights, no parachutes.  Fuck yeah, man.  Well, we've got the only uncensored medical show in the history of radio that I know of. 
[02:58:30]  Right.  And it's not so much...  Censorship has fucked up so many good medical radio shows.  Well...  Good point, Doug.  Good point.  No, he fucking...  He's got...  I need to get that for half a second.  It's not so much that we're dropping F-bombs.  It's that the audience can call in and ask anything that they want to ask without any  regard to content.  You know?  If I fuck my girl in the shit at too many times, is her asshole going to fall out?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:59:00]  So you heard our first show.  He's got a fucking following, man.  God bless him, man.  Oh, hey.  I get a medical question.  For real?  Yeah.  It's Butters related.  I love Butters.  By the way, Butters is obsessed with making me one of those fucking necklaces, and I haven't  been able to get back to him.  Are they good necklaces?  I have no idea what he is.  It's probably some fucking...  He keeps emailing me, and he wants this...  I go, just make me a necklace.  He goes, no, I need your measurements for a fucking necklace.  Yeah, he's an odd kid.  Well, we haven't...  Just make me a necklace, Butters, and I'll be happy. 
[02:59:30]  We had a UFC, the last pay-per-view.  We had a party at the house, and Butters comes over, and at some point, everyone's joking  around, and it's after the fights, and it's all fucking testosterone-driven, drunk talk,  and someone made a joke about kegels, and the fucking exercise a woman does for the fucking  listeners to get her pussy tight after she has a kid, and Butters goes, oh, I do kegels  all the time, and they're like, and the party stops. 
[03:00:00]  Of course.  Like, do you even know what you're talking about?  He's like, yeah, yeah, the exercises, and then...  And I don't know if someone was putting words in his mouth, because he kind of like, you  do ass kegels?  What are you...  What, are you trying to keep your ass pussy tight?  Don't want to get all loosey-goosey down in your shit, pussy.  And he said it was like, and it was someone goaded him into saying it, I think, but he  said it's, you do that to stop from coming too quick. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Is that actually a medical thing?  There are people that feel that that helps, and what you do is, if you're doing it at home,  you masturbate, and then start doing the kegels at the, just before you start to ejaculate.  All right.  And you can put your thumb over the pee hole, too, just to give you an uncomfortable feeling.  It's not so much to...  Is this top gun jacking?  I get it. 
[03:01:00]  I get it.  It's visual, but it's awesome.  There you go.  And then you can back off.  Watch the canopy goose.  Doug Stanhope gets visual of the day.  But it's actually a way to help treat premature ejaculation.  All right.  Well, because Butters doesn't get laid.  That's why I found his answer suspect when he was finally...  Someone said, do you mean, like, to do that to stop from coming?  And he's like, uh, yeah.  Yeah.  Like, no, Butters is sticking things in his ass, and it's getting all sloppy down in his 
[03:01:30]  shit pussy.  Why doesn't...  Why don't you just rub one out before you hook up with the girl?  Yeah.  That's, um...  Why don't you just not care for that?  It's way easier, and you don't need a doctor.  Is that Butters?  Online?  That's what Butters looks like?  Yeah, that's Butters.  It's shit Butters.  Wow.  He's not going to shoot up any schools, is he?  Holy fuck, man.  What the hell to look at that? 
[03:02:00]  That's my Butters.  Yeah, Butters is all right.  All right, so, uh, Dr. Steve...  By the way, every time Dr. Steve comes in, he sticks a finger up someone's ass.  What, we're letting you off the hook this time?  Well, um, after Tippy Tom, you and I kind of had a deal that I didn't have to do that  anymore.  And also, I think...  Why is Bill covering his ears?  We...  Ah, just...  The fucking homeless guy, you stuck your finger up...  That was worse?  That wasn't as bad as a cadaver?  He also did Big A's ass, right? 
[03:02:30]  Yep, yep.  Big A's ass.  Did he start talking clearly?  That's...  Yeah.  We forced him to do it, and the grand finale, yeah, was Tippy Tom.  Holy shit.  Yeah, wow.  What the...  Here it is.  And he was, uh...  Is it on...  Where is it on live?  Just Google it.  It's a Tippy Tom prostate.  Oh!  Check it, cancel!  All right!  Tom, do I tell you something?  Ow!  It hurts!  I hadn't even started yet.  Yeah, he hasn't even started.  Tom?  I'm up here now! 
[03:03:00]  Come on, man!  Get me...  Oh!  Here we go.  Here we go.  Ow!  Oh!  Oh!  Wow, actually...  Your prostate is a normal size.  Amazingly.  Normal on it at all, and we're checking you for blood right now.  Oh, that's the most...  Oh, you got to pull some blood out of me, right? 
[03:03:30]  You don't know, we're checking what we got out of your rear end.  Oh, you get it from the rear end.  That's hilarious.  I miss that.  I miss that old fucking...  Did you find anything wrong with Tippy Tom?  Well, it's a miracle!  Well, yeah, we found something wrong with Tippy Tom.  He's no longer with us.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's fucking dead.  It sucks.  Less than a year after I proclaimed him perfectly healthy.  Oh, that sucks.  That's good to admit to two countries, Dr. Steve. 
[03:04:00]  No, he passed in May, I believe, right?  Yeah.  Somewhere around there?  What did he die of?  Just being outside?  I don't even...  He fell, and he hit his head when he was drunk, and he just didn't get up.  Last time we saw him, his legs were like twice the size.  We all were like, oh, fuck, this isn't going to end well.  And Dr. Steve, to give him credit, tried everything to get the guy a little healthier.  Got him...  Yeah, we got him hooked up with a clinic and...  Clinics and doctor's appointments, and he went to some of them, right?  Nah, he refused.  Oh, he did?  Yeah, he refused in the end of the day. 
[03:04:30]  All right, is a guy like that, was he ever normal?  Was he just like a regular dude?  We got to know him pretty well, yeah.  He had left his family and everything.  He had a business.  He had a business in Reno.  What was he?  Some fucking...  House painter or something.  Yeah, like clean windows or something.  But do you think he was a normal guy that could have sat at this table and conversed like we do?  Because I...  See, I'm a drunk.  And I've been a drunk.  I've been drunk every night for 25 years or whatever. 
[03:05:00]  And, I mean, how do you become that guy from us?  I've tried hard, and I'm still a normal, functioning human being.  Yeah, how do you go from having a wife and a family to being on a radio show homeless with somebody...  He was had a wife and family that were fucking a Cops episode type of wife and family would be my guess.  I don't know him personally, but anyone like that.  Is it the gene or something?  Well, there's grades of addiction.  There's no question about that.  And there probably is some genetic component to it because if you have an alcoholic in your family, you're more likely to be an alcoholic. 
[03:05:30]  You're not doomed to be an alcoholic.  But there are...  We're learning about receptors in the body.  And the people that become the crazy alcoholics tend to not produce a certain receptor in the body as much as, quote, unquote, normal people do.  And so they're more prone to...  And it's a pain and pleasure receptor, so they're more prone to alcoholism.  But I was saying, sober, that guy would still be somewhat of a... 
[03:06:00]  Punch drunk.  A dummy.  He was pretty fucking funny and quick, that Tibby Tom.  For real.  He had timing, man.  Did he grab the horn?  Oh, yeah.  He did all that on his own, man.  He had comedic timing, for real.  The guy was fucking funny.  That was hilarious.  Fucking funny, man.  Yeah, Tibby Tom was...  And those were Anthony's, and Anthony...  There's a young fucking Tibby Tom pick.  I know it's radio, but for Doug.  Looks pretty fucking...  You've seen that guy a million fucking times, right? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, let me see that first one.  A million fucking times you've seen that guy.  Just hanging out on a fucking pier with a beer.  And a cigarette.  That's not even that long ago, because he's wearing a South Park t-shirt.  Yeah, so...  He went bad, like, quick.  Ten years, he went from that to, you know, dying alone on the streets in New York City.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Probably.  You know, if you're going to die in any city, this is the city.  There you go.  You know?  Fuck this.  Yeah, I wish I was dead most of the time I'm here.  All right, Dr. Steve, so we're not doing the fingers up the butt this time. 
[03:07:00]  What do we got?  Yeah, I wonder if we even could do it in this environment over here now.  Oh, shit.  You know?  No shit.  We were checking people's prostates.  I'm going to tell you...  I mean, I'm going to preface all of this, and I pitched this, like, to Steve three months  ago.  Yeah, they've been fucking dealing with it for three months.  Approved it.  It's a dumb little bit.  Last night at nine o'clock.  Yeah, I know.  With all these...  Stipulations.  Stipulations.  I had to write an email.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  I learned from Evan to try to throw out big words like that.  Stipulations.  I fucking nailed it. 
[03:07:30]  They waste their time with this shit.  It's an easy, quick bit.  Just shut up.  Yeah.  It's not like radio, and it's a doctor.  And so, all the funds...  Why did it take three months?  All the funds have been sucked out of it, but we'll see the last week.  Oh, really?  Well, don't you think?  But, well, we'll see.  I think there's some...  We'll let the audience...  Yeah, there's some potential there.  So, what are you going to do?  Well, what we're doing is...  I've got some of my folks from Weird Medicine, and two of them are diabetic.  And in the old days, like in ancient Greece, and I'm sure Hippocrates did this, they would 
[03:08:00]  notice that certain people pissed like racehorses.  And they called it diabetes because it means...  That's Greek for siphon.  And the only way that they could tell the difference between people with high blood sugar and people  who had brain tumors that made them piss like a racehorse was to taste their urine.  And they called diabetes with sugar in it, mellitus, meaning tastes like honey.  And then they had the stuff that tastes like water, insipidus. 
[03:08:30]  So, there's diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus.  So, and those names have been carried forward.  I mean, we still use those names today.  But that's where the origin of those words were.  Now, up until about 100 years ago, well, maybe it was 50 years ago, doctors still tasted urine.  Is there going to be a pop quiz?  You bring so much class to a piss-drinking gag.  I know.  What the fuck?  All right, all right.  I just got that feeling.  I'm in biology class again. 
[03:09:00]  Well, I'm just setting up the history.  So, mellitus means tastes like honey.  And so, up until like 50 years ago, doctors still tasted urine to see if their patients were diabetic.  I'm going to interrupt here.  I would just blow up if we could just smash cut to us in a bar, being drunk, trying to act like we read what he just said.  The Greek word diabetes.  Diabetes insipidus means that's like when you piss like a racehorse, lady.  We've been using it for years.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  You want to make out? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, exactly.  So, one of the reasons that we developed physician's assistance was so that we didn't have to taste the piss anymore.  So, I've got my assistant here, Double Vasectomy Todd from the Weird Medicine Show.  And we've also got P.A. John, and he's coming in.  We've got a lawyer just to make sure that we don't do anything untoward.  Just for a quick back story, Double Vasectomy.  Yeah, his tubes were so vigorous that it took two vasectomies to take care of him, so that's his radio name. 
[03:10:00]  All right.  So, this is Todd, and he'll be our tester today.  And he's going to play the part of the old-timey doctor.  What the fuck?  And we've got, we have Pat, and everybody else has given urine samples, and they're in Mark.  So, Todd, what do you do for a living?  It's funny you should ask.  What?  Big A's here, too?  Yeah, Big A's here.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, we just figured Big A's got to be funny. 
[03:10:30]  Right, right.  So, we've got Big A, two controlled diabetics, and then Pat from Munaki, who is an uncontrolled diabetic right now.  We're working on that.  Okay.  And he's going to be our test subject.  So, what the trick is, is that...  Wait, the dude with the sleeve is a fucking doctor?  No.  No, no, no.  He's an old-timey doctor.  He's a barber, actually.  You know, they were the original doctors.  But you taught him what to taste for?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sure.  I mean...  Why don't you fucking taste this?  Because, like I said, that's why we invented physician's assistance, so we don't have to taste the damn urine. 
[03:11:00]  Well, Pat from Munaki's is going to taste like eggnog.  Well, that's going to be my guess.  What I'm hoping is, Pat had a blood sugar of about 400 this morning, so he gave us a nice maple syrup.  A dollop of maple syrup.  What the fuck is he doing?  And then we're going to work on...  I'm pretty much paying...  Human IHOP.  I'm pretty much paying for his medical care at this point.  Yes, you are.  Then fucking do the right thing, Pat.  And by the way, you won the weird medicine...  I'm actually a good guy. 
[03:11:30]  That was stupid.  You won the weird medicine philanthropy award this year.  Don't you have those finger-pokey blood machines that can do this?  Just curious.  Yeah, absolutely.  But we're just recreating a historic event in the history of medicine.  You know when they used to use fucking, what, slugs and shit?  Leeches.  Leeches and all that crap.  It's like when you go to...  I still use them.  It's like when you go to Sturbridge.  It's homeopathic.  It's like when you go to Sturbridge Village.  Yeah.  Oh, Sturbridge Village.  And they start churning butter.  Yeah.  I'd be into that hellhole.  Can we bring in the big egg and all those guys? 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Sturbridge Village reference.  That's a great reference.  So what we're going to do is...  I'm going to give you a reference of the day, Bill.  Just only because I knew he was from Worcester.  Yeah, all right.  Double vasectomy, Todd, doesn't know which one of these samples has sugar.  How did they know the first one didn't work?  Did you blow out a kid accidentally after the first vasectomy?  No, I got tested.  Oh, I got a vasectomy, but I never went back.  I trusted their work.  Oh, good call.  Yeah.  They kind of shied me away after...  Everybody looks like famous people to me today. 
[03:12:30]  Bring your samples over here.  Hey, Dr. Steve, shut up for a second.  Bill, Bill, Bill, what?  Everybody looks like famous people today.  All right, who do you got?  Big A looks like retarded James Gandolfini.  No.  Isn't that an oxymoron?  Bring me your...  We think he looks like the penguin.  You're in.  I thought you wanted sperm.  He looks like the penguin from the Batman movie.  When fucking Denny DeVito.  I just see the Tor Johnson.  Tor Johnson is big A, yes.  Very good.  So everyone is handling in their urine samples? 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, I'm missing some.  Who the fuck filled it all the way to the tippy top?  You don't need that much.  Bill, can you go over there and check out the urine samples?  Not at all.  Check his prostate, because maybe he couldn't cut it off quick enough.  Because he's getting an enlarged prostate.  So jam your finger in his ass while you're drinking his piss.  Hell, if you want to see it, we can do that for you, Doug.  That's fucking gross, man.  Big A, how are you doing today?  I'm quite open.  Not bad.  Yeah, not bad?  Good.  Yep.  All right.  And Pat? 
[03:13:30]  What's up?  Hey!  What's up?  Oh, nothing.  Yeah?  See my black eye?  Yeah, what happened?  Your other eye.  Did he just point at the wrong fucking eye?  I'm Lee Heavy Oswald.  No.  What?  Lee Harvey Oswald had a black eye when Jack Ruby shot him when he was saying, I'm just  a patsy.  I thought he...  I'm sorry, I had to dumb it down for this room.  I thought you said Leaf. 
[03:14:00]  Leaf Harvey.  My cat, actually, she was wanting for me to pick her up.  Yeah.  And I usually just kiss her on top of the head.  And she usually puts her head down for me to kiss her.  This time, she just whacked me in the, like, right below the eye.  Wow.  Okay.  And it's a gorilla.  What'd you do to the cat?  Fucked her.  What else?  What else?  No.  No, I just put her down.  You didn't swing it around by his tail?  Bad.  No.  No.  She didn't know what she was doing.  So, you've met these guys, right?  You've met Pat and Big A?  Yeah. 
[03:14:30]  I'll do that, yeah.  Big A?  Big A, what...  Why do you have a button on?  What's that about?  Oh, weird medicine.  It's a weird medicine button?  Yeah.  He's wearing a weird medicine button, and we were...  How the fuck does he have more fucking merchandise than the Opie and Anthony show?  Well...  What the fuck is it?  Ah, magnet.  All right, I'll put this somewhere.  Okay, we're testing the urine.  How about Jackie Gleason?  Wait, we're testing already?  No, I'm just testing it while you're talking.  What we're looking for is to make sure that none of these samples is dangerous for a double 
[03:15:00]  vasectomy, Todd, to sample.  So, we're testing for glucose, protein, and white blood cells.  So, if anybody has white blood cells in their urine, we're going to kick out their sample.  And why would that be bad?  And then also...  It'd be a sign of infection.  And that guy has to leave wondering what the fuck he has.  That's great.  That's great.  Right.  So, P.A. John and I are doing this.  Who the fuck's P.A. John?  He's on the show, Weird Medicine.  Hi, P.A. John. 
[03:15:30]  He assisted me with Tippy Tom's brother.  Yeah, sure.  And who's the other guy?  You just met him?  Okay, that's...  No, I'm...  This guy.  Rob from Elizabethan...  Bingo, you can peek through the corner of the curtain and not miss this.  Rob from Elizabethan is our version of Stalker, Matt.  Why is he your version of Stalker?  Well, yeah, he started emailing me and emailing me and emailing me.  A great way to put it, Steve.  Oh, you're a Stalker?  That's cool.  And then, uh...  I never thought of myself that way.  And he's Mr. Nervous.  Stalkers never do, yeah.  He's very nervous, Bill.  Yeah, he's very nervous.  What are you nervous about? 
[03:16:00]  Who, me?  Yeah.  Ah, nothing.  This is just me.  This is my natural demeanor.  A few million.  Ah, Pat.  A few million people listening right now.  That's right.  A big Yankee fan, Pat.  What's that?  Yankees?  Yeah.  Yeah, why?  Not a big fan.  My brother was a big fan of the Yankees, and I hate my brother, so...  Yeah.  But I don't hate the Yankees.  Okay.  That's usually why you hate a team, anyway, because you hate some fan of his that was a  douchebag in a sports bar, and you...  Well, fuck the Raiders, then. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  I hate them forever, because of you.  Big A?  Yankees fan?  Oh, yes, I like Yankees.  Yeah, you going to the parade?  He's wearing pinstripes.  Oh, no.  Well, yes, he is, Pat.  Yes, he is.  All right, Dr. Steve's testing the...  Yep, we've tested the final sample, and there is one that has a particularly large amount  of sugar in it, and then the other three don't.  And everyone is still good?  No infections?  Yep, no infections. 
[03:17:00]  All right.  Minimal amount of sugar.  Who could that be?  All right, so we ready?  Todd?  I guess.  We need to get Todd on mic.  All right, so...  As ready as I'm going to get.  You're going to be tasting the urine, and then you're going to be able to tell who  has diabetes.  How many people have diabetes in this room right now, as far as the samples go?  Yeah, now, only one is...  Your whole staff has diabetes.  I know.  These two are type 1 diabetics, and they're under control.  They're both on the insulin pump.  Nice.  And then Pat is not, so we're... 
[03:17:30]  And we're working with Pat on his.  But today, I think he skipped his medicine last week.  Yeah.  Doctor's orders.  Dr. Mengele.  All right, how many samples you got?  We got four.  Where's the four people, though?  This is the least confident...  Four people, raise your hands.  ...of any joke ever.  Oh, okay.  Big A, Pat, and to your guys.  He says funny shit, too.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So we're going to do the first sample.  We need...  Oh, and there's some wipes over here.  Yeah, please.  ...for you to cleanse your palate between dips. 
[03:18:00]  Better get a bucket.  Hey, when we're done, can we do, like, a Gatorade, like, dump over someone's head with  the remaining samples?  We're in medicine this Saturday night.  Can you win at this game?  I don't think so.  No, this is a lose.  Everyone but me can win at this game.  Let's fucking bet on this.  Are you serious?  Okay.  You want to bet on it?  Let's have some money.  All right.  Maybe it's too...  Wait.  Wait.  How can we bet?  Well, obviously...  Okay.  You're a gambler.  How do we figure this out?  Let's get some betting going. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  We know the one is Pat's.  He doesn't know which sample it is.  So will he be able to pick it?  So will he be able to pick out Pat's urine from everyone else?  This is the bet.  I got 20 that says no.  I have 20 that says yes.  Yeah.  It's going to taste like blueberry pancakes.  Yeah.  I don't think he's going to get enough of a taste.  Wait.  He has to lick it off a swab or something?  No.  He's going to dip his finger in it and touch the drop to his mouth.  You're going to take that.  We've got to give him two to one odds then.  Yeah.  No. 
[03:19:00]  Just even odds.  I'd say, all right.  He's going to be able to tell.  All right.  Here we go.  Wow.  Reality just set in.  Jesus.  You've never done this before?  No.  Why would I do this?  What the fuck is going to...  Well, we're going to practice this?  God.  But how do you teach him what to taste for?  One is sweet.  The other ones taste like piss.  Now, that's all you're told of?  No, they all taste like piss, dude.  Now, real quick, real quick.  How do you do this?  You should have your license yet.  Do you dip your finger in like the cop testing to see if it's coke? 
[03:19:30]  Yes.  Exactly.  Or do you just do a shot?  No, no, no.  He can't do a shot.  He can't do a shot.  That's one of the stipulations from the attorneys is he has to stick his finger in it.  Fucking attorneys ruin everything.  No shit.  We should be fucking taking this shit.  That's what happens when you ask.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We used to not ask.  You're right, Pat.  We only got fired.  Well, it's warm.  Jesus.  It's warm?  Todd's dipping his finger.  All right.  Here's Todd.  God!  Jesus Christ.  Well, it ain't blueberry fucking pancakes, I can tell you that. 
[03:20:00]  Jesus Christ.  Oh, that's keeping me out.  Nothing grashes me out.  Bill, you all right?  Yeah, I'm not all right with that.  I've seen a lot of shit.  I don't think I'm all right with that one.  He's not all right either.  Bad.  Doug?  Okay, so what is it?  Not so bad on the urine.  This is an ear pus, well, nothing will ever.  Oh, yeah, we'll talk about that after this.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  What did it taste like?  Piss.  Yeah, it was insipid and nasty.  How do you know it tastes like piss?  Good question.  I don't know.  It was kind of like warm, light beer with some asparagus in it. 
[03:20:30]  The undertones of crap.  And an aftertaste of apricots.  Yeah, kind of like Dr. Steve's wine, really.  A bouquet of ammonia.  Think of the journey that liquid took.  Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?  Dr. Steve makes the worst wine possible.  But his label maker is really impressive.  Yeah, really impressive.  And his bottling technique is very good.  Dr. Steve's urine is making wine.  So what do we do?  Okay, that's sample number one.  We're going to go through the samples. 
[03:21:00]  That wasn't real sweet, so I'm betting that wasn't Pat.  All right, okay.  Keep it to yourself.  So that was number one.  Yeah.  All right.  Here comes the second one.  Todd.  Todd.  Warmer than the last one.  And kind of honey-like.  That thing just quickly drove off his finger.  Jesus.  Damn it.  Fool me once.  Shame on you.  Dr. Steve's like a shot girl.  Was that worse than the first one? 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  It seems like it.  You got urine jello shots.  Why was it worse than the first one?  You know, the first one might have been the worst because I wasn't expecting it.  But in this one, I kind of knew what was coming.  But still, Jesus, that's awful.  That is the worst.  Dr. Steve said, fool me once.  Shame on you.  Anyone want my yogurt?  Yeah.  And by the way, when we started this, there were going to be three specimens.  And you snuck another one in on me.  If I make it. 
[03:22:00]  God.  Okay.  Cleanse your palate with the wipe.  Hey, Steve, you sick fuck.  Why did you make everyone fill up their thing to the tippy top?  I didn't really give them instructions on that.  They did that on their own.  That's big ace.  It's so odd.  Wow.  Okay.  I guess I better use a different finger for each one so I don't cross-contaminate, right?  Well, that's what the wipe is for.  That's what the wipe is for.  A little bit leveled.  This gets no easier as it goes along.  It's not like shots.  Cri-manate.  Well, here you go.  Hmm.  Ah! 
[03:22:30]  Jesus Christ.  Why would you...  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Better get a bucket.  Winner.  Ah.  No, I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right.  Tell me.  There has been nothing sweet on my palate yet at all.  Okay.  So, unless the last one is Pat, somebody's winning 20 bucks.  Yeah.  I, uh, can you taste that one again because it looked like...  No!  No!  I'm not sure... 
[03:23:00]  Come on, there's money on the line.  You've got to do it again.  We've got money.  I'm not sure if he actually really...  It ain't my money.  If you threw up a little bit in your mouth, it kind of queers the whole test.  Yeah.  No, I didn't.  Are we going back to the third sample?  Sure.  Yeah, go back to the third.  Oh, hot.  I think we all saw in the room.  I don't know, you know, if that one was accurate, right?  Don't...  Right.  The acid in his mouth.  God.  So, this is third again?  Yeah.  Maybe not.  Yeah.  Just to, you know, just to make sure you got it right.  Oh, that's right.  Fuck you.  Ugh.  This is for the wine joke, isn't it? 
[03:23:30]  You should go all the way to the bottom to see if there's any sediment.  Oh, Christ.  Are you laughing or puking?  Both.  Fuck.  He really has a problem with the third sample.  That's...  Oh, man.  All right.  Did you get that one?  Did you just...  You know what?  By the way...  Do you feel like that's a good one?  Just by watching the reaction, I'm going to tell which sample was each guy.  Okay.  That's what I do.  Okay.  Wow. 
[03:24:00]  Awesome.  That would be a great...  About seeing our taints?  Yeah.  Hold on.  So, what would that make him medically?  Second opinion?  Boo.  Yeah.  That's okay.  I'm a little off my game.  It's okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Here comes the fourth and last sample.  Trying to figure out who has diabetes by tasting their urine.  God damn it.  You're in the money.  You're in the money.  God damn it.  That was Pat.  I'm betting that was Pat because it was just a little bit sweeter than the rest of them. 
[03:24:30]  Because it was the last...  Yeah, you're right.  The last piss he drank is always the sweetest.  Did you taste a little onion in there?  I had some onions last night.  Oh, they all have onion and...  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  You all right?  I haven't even been able to look...  I know.  I see that.  One time...  He did four samples.  Five.  Five samples.  Three.  Three he felt were not Pat's and the fourth one he thought was Pat's. 
[03:25:00]  Well, pretty accurate because I'm going to say the fourth sample was Pat by the reaction,  obviously.  Number three was so big A.  And I don't know your two cohorts.  Who's the other pisses?  You?  Yeah.  Raise your hands, guys.  Let me look at your belly.  All right.  You were number one and then he's number two.  So how do I do that?  What's his name?  That's Rob.  That's John.  That's John.  John was sample one.  And who?  What?  Rob.  And Rob was two. 
[03:25:30]  That's my guesses.  I'm going to switch that.  I'm going to say his was one, he was two.  I'm with you on big A and Pat.  Okay.  Okay.  Initially, I was going to say no, sorry to Todd.  So he'd have to test the one again.  But you already pulled that trick on him.  Actually, who was number one?  Okay.  So whoever got him as number one was exactly right.  John, I could be a doctor.  Let's go.  I know I got all four now.  Because that was the only one I had a problem with. 
[03:26:00]  You got it exactly right.  And Todd detected.  So we've proven that this is not a myth, that this was a real thing.  Hold on.  And so who's number two, Rob?  It was me.  And big A's three?  Yep.  You nailed it.  I fucking nailed it.  Wow.  I want my medical degree and I want it now.  Go with the diet.  Wow.  The diet.  Because he's like in the best shape and it was less of a reaction.  You could go into urology.  You'd probably be good at that.  Look at that.  You can taste my piss anytime.  I've had two fingers on my ass in the last few months. 
[03:26:30]  I know a little something about fucking prostates.  Trust me.  Really?  I had a little scare.  Everything's good, though.  Yeah.  A little scare.  But it was nothing.  It's always nothing.  Yeah.  That's why I don't go.  But for three months, I had to wonder if I had something.  That's where they trick it.  And that's the feeling you have afterwards when they go, hey, you're all good.  And so it's like, yeah, well, you really didn't need to do that.  I got paranoid once.  I must have had some kind of urinary tract infection.  It was just like a fucking touch of infection at the head of my cock.  And I freaked out.  And I went and they had to fucking jam the metal Q-tip down your cock head and scrape 
[03:27:00]  you to fucking test you.  And I had nothing.  And I was so fucking angry that I went through that.  Like, I should have just done, like, everything I've just ignored went away.  You're almost angry you got nothing.  Yeah.  No, I want some.  You're like, what do you mean nothing?  And I was first out on the road, so I was just, you know, you're going to feel some pressure.  Right, right.  Yeah, a little.  Yeah.  I thought one way that we could end this bit, because there's not a huge payoff other than  that OB is a fucking genius.  Well, bring the interns back in.  They can close a bit strong.  Well, I'm wondering if E-Rock would want to smell double vasectomy Todd's breath after 
[03:27:30]  that.  Yay!  Yay!  Yay!  Man kiss.  Man kiss.  Hang on, hang on.  Hold on.  Fred from Brooklyn makes a very good point.  Let's go to Fred.  Uh, Fred, how are you, buddy?  Hey, good morning, buddy.  What are you going to do next?  Chase cum for cancer?  This is fucking disgusting.  I'm trying to eat breakfast here.  Is there a cum test?  Dr. Steve.  Thank you, Fred. 
[03:28:00]  Jesus.  Not today.  Not today.  That's next year.  All right, E-Rock's going to smell Todd's breath.  Double vasectomy Todd or whatever.  Not puke-worthy?  Puke-worthy?  He's making a face.  Here you go, bro.  Oh, take another shot.  Take another hit.  One more hit, E-Rock.  Can we do like it?  Come on, E-Rock.  Puke is funny.  Come on, virus. 
[03:28:30]  Come up with something.  Dude, you have piss for half.  Get away from me.  What is this breath?  I didn't go.  What does his breath smell like?  It smells like piss, but...  Dr. Steve, can we do a sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff breath?  Yeah, of course.  E-Rock, are you good for a sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff breath?  As long as the lawyers are okay with it, because we're going outside the parameters.  It was like four-card Monty with the samples.  Right.  And do it again.  That's a good point. 
[03:29:00]  Two out of three.  No, it was very obvious.  When did this shit come down on satellite radio with all the fucking lawyer shit?  Like, see, when I yell and scream, they think...  This was the fucking Wild West last time.  Because when I yell and scream, they think I'm fucking nuts.  Thank you, Doug.  Well...  That was just backing me up.  Frustrating as hell.  I can't even tell you.  Is it fucking corporate?  Oh, hell yeah.  Expiratory humor apparently can be considered still obscene, even on satellite.  But the way it was explained to me is that they're worried about some attorney general in Alabama 
[03:29:30]  wanting to make a name for himself by saying these guys were throwing urine on the studio.  Your attorneys all worry about what might happen.  On the pay service?  Yeah.  No, I've...  You've dealt with it.  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  The man show.  I can't even imagine.  Fucking unbelievable.  I can't even imagine what you guys dealt with.  Shit, you're just jaw-dropping.  Where you go, I'm not even fucking trying anymore.  That's what happens.  That's what fucking happens.  Fucking Rogan might have told you this story.  But we had one idea we were going to do a fucking...  Bring titty dancers and beer to the homeless. 
[03:30:00]  Set up a homeless fucking titties and beer camp.  Easy bit.  Do it like a humanitarian beer drop.  And have a fucking UN-style truck with juggies and the fucking flag jackets.  And they said, no, you can't bring them alcohol because these people are alcoholics.  And we go, all right, we fucking settle for...  We'll bring it fake beer with man show beer labels.  Oh, you can't do that because even fake beer has trace amounts of alcohol which could cause a reaction.  And then it ended with... 
[03:30:30]  This is over a course of fucking like two weeks of back and forth waiting for word back.  It came down to their last note was, well, what if one of these homeless people has AIDS and bites one of the crew?  They actually said that.  And that's where you go, you know what?  Fuck it.  I'll do your stupid fucking jokes.  Lawrence Talbert's homeless.  They beat you down, man.  Because you come up with these really creative things that you know will work with the audience.  And then by the time that it goes through the lawyer filter...  And lawyers fuck up more shit than censors.  You actually sit here depressed as all hell because you know how good it could be. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, although this one was all right.  And then the kicker in the end is when it isn't funny, then it's your fault.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, right.  Because then all of a sudden the ratings come out.  What happened?  What do you mean what happened?  You took the balls out of your joke.  Where do I start?  Well, yeah, that's why I had to do the long prelude to this thing to give it social relevance.  Yeah.  The stuff they think of is like, shut up.  Just fucking go away.  Go work on something else. 
[03:31:30]  All right.  What else can we do with Dr. Steve?  What else can we do with urine?  Yeah, can we pour it on people's heads?  Yeah, there's leftover urine.  We can't do anything.  I like donut day a lot where you can bring home a fucking honey glaze.  But urine day.  We could dump donuts in.  All that leftover piss.  How about we dump donuts in the urine?  Steve Steve is panicking that you will do something else with the urine.  Diabetic piss mustache. 
[03:32:00]  See, this is the writer's room right now.  We're brainstorming.  Let's table this.  If I had free reigns, trust me, we would be doing some shit with the urine right now.  Glaze donut in diabetic piss.  Right.  What?  What, what, what?  Steve C. has said he will shut the show down if E-Rock drinks piss.  Really, Steve?  You're going to shut the show down?  That sounds like a challenge.  I dare you.  Let me tell you something, Steve.  That'll be the last thing you do for the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:32:30]  Trust me.  Trust me on that.  Ain't shutting no fucking show down, ever.  Now I'm pissed.  So to speak.  That's a new thing.  We have all these people that are milling about getting ready to shut the show down at any moment.  For dumb shit, by the way.  Dumb shit.  Nothing even crazy.  All right.  Thanks, Dr. Steve.  It sounds like you're going to have a good show tomorrow night.  Yeah, we are.  What are you talking about? 
[03:33:00]  We're going to talk about a guy whose testicle flew out the window during a masturbation episode at work.  That's how?  Come on.  No, it's absolutely true.  Came out of his ball sack?  Yeah.  How?  He came that hard.  I've done it to a chick.  Dude, you've got a much bigger audience now, so blow all your good stuff on our show.  Fuck it.  It's a work-related injury.  It involves pulleys and stuff.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, the belt sander.  You get his fucking nuts.  He was trying to jerk off with a belt sander, and his nuts get caught up in the thing and 
[03:33:30]  tore his fucking balls out.  And then he tried to, like, staple it shut so no one would find out.  I know that guy.  Okay, well, I might as well tell the story right now.  He's one of my speedy spins.  Wait, wait.  He tried to put his ball back in like it's free-floating in there and not connected?  No, it actually flew out.  He tore his bag open, and his ball flew out.  He put his ball back in and tried to staple it shut.  And it's not until it went infected and septic that he finally, like, I guess he couldn't hide  the stink from his co-workers.  And he finally went to a doctor. 
[03:34:00]  And, uh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he had, uh, like, uh, like a gallon of pus in his ball's neck.  Oh, Jesus.  I mean, when he walked in, he was so embarrassed that he didn't want to go to the doctor.  So, that's in the medical literature so we can talk about it.  Wow.  Adrenaline and denial.  And actually...  Do you have this guy on?  No, no, no.  That would be a coup.  It would be, and I'm going to work on that.  What about, uh, is it today, Tyra?  Yes, I think so.  Are you going to be talking about the girl with the two vaginas?  No.  I think she's got it.  Tyra's got her as a guest today. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, she does.  Wow.  Is that...  That's obviously very rare.  Yeah, obviously.  What's that about?  Is that a twin that was supposed to pop out?  Maybe a twin that was supposed to be there.  You could just have a, what's called a septation between, you know, in the vagina that would  cause two cavities but not be two actual vaginas.  I mean, it would be by definition two vaginas.  I just have a real hairy asshole.  A new hole is a new hole.  Fuck it, Ty.  It's like the Lincoln Tunnel.  We've got to get you on more, pal.  Somehow we've got to get you on more. 
[03:35:00]  We're going to have Rich Voss talking about getting off drugs the old school way.  Enough with Rich.  This dumb drug thing.  Come on.  It'll be all right.  What is he going to say?  Well, I don't know.  He's still milking it.  That's what I mean.  I'm happy for him.  That's how he got the drugs.  Milking it.  How many years sober?  Like Rick Shapiro.  Okay, you sucked a dick for heroin, but it's over 20 years ago.  You better suck a recent dick if you're going to keep dropping that gear out. 
[03:35:30]  We're all happy for Rich.  He'll give you good radio.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, no, it'll be fine.  And we've got, you know, another guy coming on after him that did it the new school way with  Suboxone, and we'll just sort of compare those things.  Hey, ask Rich if he ever eats any red meat.  Okay.  Just do that.  Okay.  That's a story he loves to tell.  Okay.  I haven't ate red meat in 28 years.  So I'll get five minutes out of that.  Okay, thank you.  So he's coming in?  No, no.  He's in Vegas, so we're just going to do a film.  Suboxone action.  All right.  Yeah, and then Big A's going to come in and get his speech, his major malfunction diagnosed 
[03:36:00]  by a speech pathologist.  What do you think it is?  What do you think it is?  Well, hell, that's why I have a speech pathologist, because I don't know.  Because his brain's there.  Yeah.  No, absolutely.  Totally there.  Totally there.  There's plenty of blood.  Look at the vein in his forehead.  Fucking getting in there.  I'm paying for their medical shit.  When are they going to fucking start dropping weight?  What's with the bullfrog gullet?  Is that a problem?  What's that?  The bullfrog gullet.  He had a neck skirt.  Dude, he had a tumor removed from that, too.  Oh, yeah? 
[03:36:30]  Remember that, Big A?  Of course you do.  Remember that?  As I'm saying that, I go, I got a tumor in my neck.  I'm going to say myself by saying, of course you do.  How big was the tumor?  Tell Doug.  I think it was that big.  Yeah.  Nice.  Good thing we're on TV.  Did you keep it?  No, no.  Size of a golf ball, roughly, is what you're...  Yeah.  Why would you keep...  I would keep that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Put it under your pillow for the tumor fairy. 
[03:37:00]  How much could you get for a golf ball tumor, do you think?  It was a matzo ball he swallowed the wrong way.  He really does have a pelican chin now, huh?  Are you trying to lose weight?  Are we swallowing fish hole?  Actually, I am, man.  It's not easy, but I am.  Why isn't it easy?  He's got bad sleep apnea, and we got hooked up with a guy named John Gray, who works for  one of the... 
[03:37:30]  I can't remember the name of the company that he works for.  He's got a band, though.  We'll probably have to plug his band on our show.  But he got Andrew a CPAP mask for free, and that's going to make a big difference in his  ability to be able to lose weight.  Because when you've got really, really bad sleep apnea like he does, you're just filling  up with fluid.  You're sleeping all the time.  You're not using energy when you are up.  And so, you know, you're not getting that restful sleep, so you can't drop the weight. 
[03:38:00]  You look to me, like, since the last time I've saw you, that you've dropped some weight.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we're still working on it.  I think some vertical stripes on his shirt makes him look sliver.  I just seem to need a new prescription.  Well, the big thing is, is I'm not treating them, but I'm facilitating their treatment.  And then your money, for which you won the Weird Medicine Philanthropy Award last year,  by the way.  Just amazing, right?  What am I going to do next? 
[03:38:30]  It's just crazy.  I've done it all now.  But these two guys both have jobs, and neither one of them have insurance, and they've got  bad medical problems.  So we've at least gotten them back into their doctors, and we're funding their office visits  and all that stuff.  Look at how powerful it is.  Fucking medical bills.  The least you can do for me is make sure your urine doesn't taste like syrup.  Well, I was requested.  Oh.  I just didn't take the pills last night.  He didn't take his pills last night.  Oh, all right.  So I've set up the bid a little bit.  Yeah.  That's good.  Let me say hi to Greg in Austin. 
[03:39:00]  Greg.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Dr. Steve, I'm just trying to find out what's the, why do you have such a problem with Dr.  Kaku?  You know, if he started commenting on all kinds of medical stuff, we'd all think he's an  asshole.  So why do you hate him?  Well.  You know who Michu Kaku is, Doug Stanhope?  No, I have no idea.  He's a, what's his, he likes the stars.  He never met you, Kaku.  He's into the space thing, you know.  All right.  Yeah.  No, yeah.  And Dr. Steve knows a little bit about that stuff, too, and thinks Michu Kaku, who's known 
[03:39:30]  all over the world, is full of shit.  Well, no, you know, this guy's absolutely right.  I mean, I'm an asshole for even saying anything about him.  I've read his papers, and I mean, he's published in physical journals, and I've never had been.  I am the editor of a medical journal, and so he's right.  If he started spouting off about medical stuff, I'd think he was a prick.  So, you know, it's just, I grew up with Carl Sagan, and Sagan was the great, you know, liberator 
[03:40:00]  of knowledge, and, you know, Kaku just, just his approach to it is so fairytale.  It's all this, you know, you know, we're, if you go through a toroidal black hole, it's  Alice in Wonderland, Anthony.  I mean, you know, it's the way he...  Well, he had to dumb it down for us.  You think, okay, so Alice in Wonderland's a good reference to...  It's a looking glass, yeah, yeah, okay.  And what about the Sagan?  No, you know, I've got to go with him on this one.  The same way a comedian can look at a comedian, know it's a hack, even though it's selling 
[03:40:30]  out fucking, you know, big-time theaters.  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  We're like in the hacky doctors.  This is coming from a licensed physician who asked me to bring my sugar checker.  I go, you mean my glucose monitor?  And did Sagan know there were more fucking planets out there?  Oh, yeah, Sagan was awesome.  He knew there were more planets?  Billions and billions.  He...  I believe he died before the first exoplanets were ever discovered.  But he was already talking about it?  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Okay, then that's impressive. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, Sagan was awesome.  All right.  We got Yoko Ono on Jimmy Fallon.  That's worth playing, too, today.  She was awesome.  That's good?  Yeah, she was awesome.  Oh, yeah.  Any Yoko Ono fans in here?  She's got great voice.  I can't stop thinking of that now.  I'm sorry.  I'm starting to bug Sam.  I don't sound like that.  With the high voice.  All right.  Do you want to just play this?  Yeah.  There's 20 people just staring at us.  I know.  I just didn't even realize that there's like 9,000 people in here.  Almost 20 people in here now.  We'll drink our urine and leave. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, three cups of urine.  Well, you don't have to leave.  We'll get rid of the fucking, you know...  We're talking about Carl Sagan and stuff, but secretly we're drinking piss and rubbing it all over each other.  We're just talking about Sagan so the lawyers don't catch on.  So they turn off the show and go bother somebody else.  Fucking scooping up feces and melon ballers and throwing it around like Highlight.  Whee!  Fuck you, lawyers.  We just won't say it.  All right. 
[03:42:00]  We'll play some Yoko Ono from Jimmy Fallon.  We'll have to stop this, obviously.  But with help from her son, Sean, and producer Mark Ronson, please welcome Yoko Ono, Plastic Ono Band, everybody.  We'll play some Yoko Ono Band. 
[03:42:30]  She's not deep enough.  She sounds like she's being tased.  Did you ever call her tased, Wesley?  I'm waiting for a DJ.  I'm waiting for a DJ. 
[03:43:00]  It wasn't a rock.  It was a rock.  It was a rock star.  It was a rock star.  It's a cold with red.  Red, red, red, red, red.  Oh, I'm shooting for my friends.  I'm shooting for my friends.  Looking at the dead.  Looking at the dead.  How much longer, Sam? 
[03:43:30]  It's about three and a half minutes.  I saw Sean Lennon concert.  The guy could be amazing.  He's got an amazing voice.  He's really talented.  And he's got a humorous fucking mother with this shit.  Oh, is he in that band?  Yes.  He's a great bass player.  Is he in the band?  Or is he just doing that appearance?  He's helping her out.  Because this is what she wants to do.  Fucking Sean Lennon has a great voice.  Sounds like John's voice.  Maybe you just don't get it.  I understand that.  That's what it is.  It's too high-brow form. 
[03:44:00]  Exactly.  How many fucking units do you think she's selling?  For real.  How many people are running to fucking iTunes for this?  They killed me.  They killed me.  That's nice.  Oh, oh.  What a sight.  What a sight.  A allows. 
[03:44:30]  Hmm.  Boo!  This is going great.  Ah, did you see that?  i don't think that was is it the end pretty much sam i don't think it was over you want to hear 
[03:45:00]  more doug is there a b side the band sounds all right you know what this has to be too bad danny  left and nance not here today so uh in honor of those guys ted go ahead i would rather drink big  a's piss than listen to any more of this but it sounds just like doyle hargrove's band in the
