<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with intense frustration directed at K-Rock, a competing station under the same ownership.  The hosts, fueled by what they perceive as K-Rockâ€™s sabotage of a Buck Cherry appearance and meet-and-greet (orchestrated by their program director, derisively called the "Abercrombie and Fitch Midget," Steve Kingston),  recount their experience at a Monster Magnet/Buck Cherry concert where the latter was clearly the audience favorite.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com, a concert attendee, joins in studio to corroborate their account.  Opie and Anthony then unleash a tirade against K-Rock, providing multiple phone numbers on-air and urging listeners to flood the station with complaints.  Numerous listener calls follow, some sharing their unsuccessful attempts to contact K-Rock, others contributing to the escalating anger and accusations.  The conversation takes a bizarre turn when the hosts reveal their shared masturbation fantasies involving Patty Steele, a rival morning show host, only to discover she's married to Steve Kingston, the K-Rock program director.  The segment concludes with continued listener calls and unrelenting attacks on K-Rock.

The show continues with the ongoing K-Rock conflict, focusing on their being "C-blocked" (call blocked).  The hosts and callers struggle to reach K-Rock through various numbers, encountering unhelpful or evasive staff.  An accidental discovery of what seems to be an internal K-Rock number is noted.  The conversation veers wildly into sexually explicit territory, including detailed masturbation fantasies involving Patty Steele, phone sex anecdotes, voyeurism, and various other sexual acts.  Tangential topics include *The Weakest Link* and its host, interspersed with calls from "Old Dirty," detailing his ongoing feud with Opie, and a caller who recounts donating sperm after an IQ test.  The hosts promote Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed and Sam Adams beer.  A scheduled guest appearance by Jeff from *Survivor* is cancelled.  More listener confessions, ranging from faking injuries to voyeurism and other graphic sexual exploits, punctuate the segment.

The next segment features a barrage of listener calls. One caller describes a threesome involving his girlfriend, her 21-year-old boyfriend, and a friend with large breasts.  Another details a sexual encounter with his friend's 46-year-old mother.  The show dives into a lengthy discussion of after-school specials, recalling their often shocking content, including teen pregnancy, drug abuse (mentioning PCP and Angel Dust), bulimia, homosexuality, and child molestation.  Actors like Rex Smith, Scott Baio, and Christy McNichol are mentioned, often within the context of crude jokes.  The K-Rock feud continues, with the hosts mocking K-Rock's counter-programming efforts, suspecting staged calls from K-Rock employees.  Jay Moore, a comedian slated to appear on *Regis and Kelly*, calls in for an extended conversation filled with anecdotes and banter.

A subsequent segment focuses on a confrontation with an unnamed individual who had previously attacked the hosts.  The hosts repeatedly challenge this person to a public fight, threatening to reveal compromising information.  Crude, sexually suggestive language abounds, including a recurring joke about a man "hobbing the knob" on the floor.  Melissa, the mistress of Ken Stevens, the General Manager, calls in, engaging in flirtatious conversation with the hosts about her relationship and Ken's whereabouts.  Another caller, Michael, mentions his role in a 1979 ABC special, "The Late Great Me."  Other calls include discussions on female "hints" of sexual interest, listener-submitted "What I Learned Today" segments, and more sexually explicit jokes.  A "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest" is promoted, and a "Monkey Gram" advertisement is played, repeatedly interrupted by technical difficulties.  The show ends with a teaser for a future segment featuring a Rex Smith song from an after-school special.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW  It's the ONA Show!  Hello.  Hello.  Well, well.  Phone number 212-757-1027, right?  Lots to do today.  So, what's up?  We've been playing the show all day.  It's going to be the best show we ever do. 
[00:00:30]  Ever.  Ever, ever, ever.  Alabama Miles!  That's my favorite.  We like that one.  This is my favorite.  Yeah, but do they dump out of it?  It's a line from Meet the Parents.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  See, her name is Jay Falker.  Falker?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember when we came up with a new word and we weren't even allowed to put the new word on the radio? 
[00:01:00]  What one was that?  Cunk?  Cunk.  Yeah, we got in trouble for saying a word that wasn't even a word.  Cunk.  It's not even in the dictionary.  No.  And we're told we weren't allowed to use it.  No.  Can't use cunk because it sounds like, I don't know, bunk.  I don't know what it sounds like.  I don't either.  They're like, you can't call someone a cunk.  No.  Why not?  And we call people cunk, or we used to all the time, up until they said, no more cunk. 
[00:01:30]  How bizarre is that?  I don't know.  You're getting in trouble for a word that's not even real.  Cunk.  Cunk.  So did you have a fun night now, last night?  Oh, yeah, it was great.  Hold on, talk for a second.  I'm really hot.  You've got to strip the sweatshirt off.  There you go.  Yeah, we can get into that a little bit, and some other things. 
[00:02:00]  But there's a few people with some things to say on the phones.  We'll start there, and then we'll talk about the Monster Magnet and Buck Cherry show at the Vanderbilt down in Long Island last night.  Huge crowd for a Monday night.  It was really nice.  About 1,200 people there.  Nice.  Mostly to see Buck Cherry.  Really?  Yeah.  Hold on, Jen.  Yeah, after Buck Cherry?  Yeah.  Half the place cleared out at Monster Magnet.  Really?  Yeah.  Everyone there for Buck Cherry.  Pretty much. 
[00:02:30]  There's a review of the show on FoundryMusic.com.  Steve was there.  Steve reviewed the show?  Yeah.  Is Steve here?  Wow.  Going back to his roots with Foundry Music.  We'll get into this a little bit, because he was there.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com, coming into the studio.  Now, Steve, wasn't that what you used to do with Foundry Music?  Yeah, that was pretty much what it originally was.  Before it was bastardized by the show.  Exactly.  Well, you know, every once in a while I get the opportunity to actually review a disc or review a show. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  And have people, and have other people do that.  And so it was a real kick.  The show was great.  The show was absolutely fantastic.  The Buck Cherry portion of it, that it was, because we didn't stick around for Monster Magnet.  Oh, you were one of the people that left.  Well, you know, because it has nothing to do with Monster Magnet.  I've seen them before.  Great band live.  And they rock.  It was just getting late.  It was very late, and we had to get back.  I had to get back to Jersey.  Ben had to get back to the city.  What was the line you used in the review of Buck Cherry?  It was hilarious.  Which one?  About the lead singer? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, he looks like he's been ravaged by disease.  Josh Todd is the return of the flamboyant frontman, covered in tattoos, loves to dance around stage, sings his ass off.  He's Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, believe it or not, Stephen Tyler, and early Chris Robinson, all in one.  And a little bit of Axl.  And a little of Axl, yes.  A little of Axl in there as well.  My one gripe with that band, good songs, decent stage presence, but their frontman, this guy Josh, is the only really animated guy in that band. 
[00:04:00]  The rest of the band's kind of wooden.  So you're saying he's like your Chris Robinsons or your Mick Jaggers?  Yeah.  You know, I hate that.  Basically, the rest of the band just sort of bops around and does their thing, and he's bouncing all over the place, spitting on the crowd.  He knows how to work a crowd.  He has the sickest tattoo on his back, too.  What is it?  It's a playing card. 
[00:04:30]  It's a giant playing card.  It's a king of hearts, I think.  How drunk are you before you get that put on?  It takes up his whole back.  It's the king of hearts.  King of hearts.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it's the king of something.  I think so.  I think it's the king of hearts.  Jesus.  And I'm sure someone has the story out there why he did the king of hearts on his entire back.  The king of hearts.  Those guys rocked.  Yeah.  The crowd was completely into it, too.  That was really nice.  The first band didn't get much of a response.  Professional monster music, I think. 
[00:05:00]  Well, that's a tough slot to be in.  Always had a show.  The first band on because people are still trying to situate, and they're trying to get their ears.  And no one came to see them.  Trying to find out who has the E.  Is it the X?  It's the X.  We'll continue calling it the X.  Did you see the security pull that one chick up off the floor?  This big chick.  It was a huge chick.  Completely out cold for, I don't know, the whole time we were there until security discovered  she was just, you know, against the pole there.  Knocked out on the floor. 
[00:05:30]  But it was really a fantastic show.  Security was a little bit overzealous with some of these crowd surfers, I think.  Well, you know, I have to defend them, though.  There wasn't enough room to crowd surf.  Yeah, I understand that.  What was that?  Enough room?  Well, it was...  How do I say?  I mean, it was packed.  I understand the argument.  But there were, like, spots in front of the stage where you could easily fall.  Oh, okay.  You know, when you crowd surf, you know, like at a Lollapalooza or any...  You know, well, I'm dating myself, but the Lollapalooza shows and stuff, I mean, it was so packed. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  No one was really going to get hurt, and then eventually the security guards would pull you off the crowd.  Right.  But with this, there was only room to crowd surf, would you say, like, seven, eight feet?  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe on top of seven or eight heads.  So they could be pushing...  The safe mattress of people.  And they push you.  They push you too far back.  You're slamming right onto the floor.  So I think...  Click, click, click.  Yeah, so I think security was a little nervous about that.  Yeah, they were nervous, and it's understandable, and I understand why.  Yeah, but there were a few times I saw a couple kids just get pile-driven into the floor because they were crowd surfing and security just... 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, they want to be Rambo.  What, did the big chick just pass out or something?  We don't know.  She was asleep when we got there.  I don't know.  Plenty of other chicks to look at other than the big chick that was passed out on the floor.  Yeah, I'm pretty impressed with the Long Island raves.  The Rockets Holdings.  Yeah?  Yeah, they did all right last night.  No Joe Dirt haircuts on any of the chicks?  No, there were just...  No, there was a lot of hot women there last night.  A lot of belly shirts.  Belly shirts.  To be had by all.  Pants and high heels.  A lot of little cowboy hats, leopard prints. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  There was some stuff going on there on the show last night.  The chick in a cowboy hat, yeah.  You don't like the cowboy hat look?  It's got to be on the right girl.  Right, and not every girl can pull it off.  You don't want the girl to look like she's wearing it because she just got off the horse, you know?  Right.  It's kind of bad, but if it's a hot rock look, sure, it's still topical.  With some type of 70s retro sunglass thing?  Sure.  That's what's happening nowadays in the girls, Anthony.  Yeah, a little skirt, the high boots.  Skirts are out.  What's in?  Oh, they're doing the hot pants. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, the hot pants?  Yeah.  Hot pants halfway up their A.  The back, big camel toe.  Nice.  A handful of those.  And the jeans, the Mariah Carey jeans are huge right now, too.  That they sell pre-cut.  Now they're selling them pre-cut.  The hip hugger.  Like, really hip hugger.  The patch cuff hugger.  But it was a really, really good show.  Yeah.  That was really amazing.  Those guys could really, really be something if they just stepped up the songwriting, I think, a little bit.  Oh, see, really?  Yes, I think so.  Hey, I'm going to give out a phone number in a bit. 
[00:08:00]  You're going to want to get a pen and a piece of paper.  Get your writing utensils ready, people.  Very, very important.  Very important.  You can help the show out, actually.  It's going to be very cool.  And maybe even answer some questions you have out there.  Yeah, yeah.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I was at the show last night, and I tell you, I was just going to say the exact same thing that Steve said.  Monster Magnus songwriting is just a little bit off.  I mean, I was waiting all night for that Megasonic Teenage Warrior. 
[00:08:30]  They saved that for less, obviously.  Yeah.  Because it's their best.  One of their heads, sure.  But I was not impressed with Monster Magnus as much as I was with Buck Cherry and the first band, Professional Murder Music.  Professional Murder Music sounded like they had, like, four songs that could have been, like, wrestling entrance themes.  Yeah.  They sounded cool.  Wrestling entrance themes.  It's always tough when you go on stage and the crowd doesn't really know you, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's hard to get into it.  It was unfortunate, too, because a lot of people piled out of the building as soon as Buck Cherry got off. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, it was.  It was like.  There were a lot of people there just to see Buck Cherry.  Why did they do it like that?  You'd think they'd put Monster Magnus first.  Everybody was questioning that.  I think what happens is when they put these tours together, you know, Buck Cherry was still kind of, you know, down here a little bit.  And they're just exploding, as they speak.  So, I mean, they're going to.  They sounded real tight.  Yeah, they really did.  He's a great front man, isn't he?  Yeah, he's got a young Steven Tyler voice. 
[00:09:30]  When he gets to be 50, if that guy's still screaming the way he does now, he's going to be a legend.  That's the real trick.  Cool.  Years later, trying to sound like you did when you were at your peak.  All right, Kevin.  Thank you.  You guys rule.  All right.  We try.  We try every day.  Dylan, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  I want to yell.  I want to know.  Dylan.  Yeah.  Did you go back to the page?  I can talk to Buck Cherry about why they were pulled.  Oh, all right.  You can't use that S word.  I'm a little stoned, you know?  Yeah, you curse.  What were you saying? 
[00:10:00]  Why did Buck, did you ever go backstage and ask Buck Cherry why they pushed out and didn't call you?  Ah.  Oh, funny you would mention that.  And this ties in with your writing utensil that we asked you to get.  Yeah, I hope everyone has a pen and piece of paper handy.  Yeah.  Dylan, yeah, there was a lot going on, I guess.  What?  Did you go backstage or not?  Yeah, I went backstage and a couple guys from Buck Cherry was like saying, hey, thanks for the support.  And I gave them the look of death like, who are you kidding? 
[00:10:30]  Exactly.  But then I found out that they have no clue.  No, it's all management.  Right.  And other people that get involved and they call management and threaten them.  And then there's no meet and greet and they're not on our show and things like that happen.  Well, let's just put the facts on the table, okay, Anthony?  All right.  We're very good at this.  Sure.  We like to stick with the facts.  Sure.  What we know.  I'll tell you this much. 
[00:11:00]  The Opie and Anthony show and WNAW as a station.  It doesn't matter if WNAW as a station looks like, you know, a loser.  Looks like a-holes.  Looks like a-holes.  Sure.  But you and I look like a-holes last night.  We had a bunch of listeners that we promised a meet and greet with Buck Cherry.  Yeah.  Wasn't that how the little giveaway was promoted?  Yes.  Yeah.  That you're going to get to see the show.  For weeks.  In the ONA box.  And then you go and meet Buck Cherry.  Yeah.  For weeks.  That was discussed on the air and stuff, okay? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  And it didn't happen.  And, you know, we promised something to our contest winners and we look like idiots today.  Couldn't deliver.  Simple as that.  And the reason why we couldn't deliver?  Well, here's the facts.  We jumped on the Buck Cherry Monster Magnet show, I don't know, like three, four weeks ago.  We pretty much promoted the whole thing.  The gang at the Vanderbilt thanked us up and down for the great turnout last night.  Sure.  A lot of people, you know, showed up for the show.  It was cool in that regard. 
[00:12:00]  Now, when we were promoting it on the air, we told everyone that we were going to have  both bands on our show.  We were going to have Buck Cherry and Monster Magnet on our show.  Not only were they going to be on our show, they were going to be in studio.  Not only that, there was a good chance when we first started talking about this show that  one, maybe both bands would play for us.  Yeah.  That would be great.  We have all the equipment we need.  Very motivated.  Set up and play.  They were very motivated, okay?  All right.  Then a little time goes by and we find out, well, they can't make it into the studio. 
[00:12:30]  And there's, you know, all of a sudden excuses being made.  Excuses.  They couldn't play, but maybe they can come in.  You know, they're going to be doing a sound check on Long Island.  It's tough to get to Manhattan.  But we're dealing with it because this stuff happens all the time in radio and stuff.  Yeah.  I mean, we used to play this game all the time in Boston.  We're not new to this.  We understand.  We understand.  So they're like, but, you know, the bands could, you know, they could call in.  Sure.  And talk about whatever you want and the show and stuff.  Very excited to be aboard with you guys, okay?  And thanks for the support, blah, blah, blah.  Ticket sales are great. 
[00:13:00]  Like, all right.  Fair enough.  That's cool.  We'll still get Monster Magnet and Buck Cherry on the show.  And they promised us, in writing, in writing, the promoter, and I'm not going after him.  It has nothing to do with him because he has no clue what the F happened.  Yeah, but basically in writing that our listeners would get a meet and greet with Buck Cherry,  one of the hottest bands out there right now, and Monster Magnet.  There you go.  Been around forever, and Dave and the gang are really, really cool.  Meet and greet.  You take some pictures backstage.  You get an autograph.  You know, meet the band.  Right.  Then we discovered that there was all of a sudden problems happening. 
[00:13:30]  Something wasn't quite right.  Couldn't get in touch with certain people.  Couldn't get in touch with the record label to, you know, to find out when Buck Cherry was calling our show.  Yeah.  If and when.  The promoter was, like, really confused because we called the promoter.  You know, what's going on, Dave?  What's going on, man?  You know, he promised us Buck Cherry, Monster Magnet.  And he goes, well, quite frankly, I don't know.  I don't know.  But the record companies are running scared, and there's some kind of political thing going on. 
[00:14:00]  That's all he could get from the record weasels.  Political thing.  That's all they could get from them, okay?  I wonder what that means.  So then it comes down to, you know, last night was the show, Buck Cherry and Monster Magnet.  And now we're, like, really calling like crazy, like, well, hello, we're here.  We're being promoted to show for three weeks for you guys.  You know, where's Buck Cherry?  Now, all of a sudden, the people you're supposed to call to set up the interview, they're just nowhere to be found all of a sudden.  They disappear. 
[00:14:30]  Between the hours of 3 and 7, because it's easier that way.  Instead of talking to someone, let's go and hide.  Right.  And then when 7 o'clock rolls around, oh, well, I don't know.  They were at a, you know, a buffet for the last three hours.  Sorry about that, guys.  And the band knows nothing of this.  No, I'm not blaming Buck Cherry.  They obviously had no clue when I ran into a couple of the guys backstage, because they were thanking us for the support.  Mm-hmm.  All right, this is pretty much what happened, okay?  Okay.  K-Rock.  Yeah.  The Abercrombie and Fitch Midget, better known as Steve Kingston. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  The sushbag that he is, who plays a lot of games behind the scene, pretty much C-blocked us from having Buck Cherry on our show.  Yeah.  He C-blocked us.  But see, he won't admit that, and he'll, you know, he's a little weasel and a little worm.  He doesn't have the balls to go on his stupid station there and admit it.  No.  He doesn't have the balls to call our boss and admit it.  No.  But we know that's what happened.  They, uh, what he does is he, you know, he'll call the management of a band or a record company rep and say, uh, look, if you want your band played on K-Rock, they better not appear on Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  This happens all the time.  Don't think we're crazy, because this happens all the time with competition.  And the record weasels, in a lot of cases, they're in the middle of this, and they run scared, because they're like, oh, because all they want to worry about is making their band huge.  And how many times the record will be played on K-Rock. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  So, you know, someone like the Abercrombie and Fitch Midget has the power to go to the record label and basically threaten them and say, look, you go on that show, this is going to happen.  Yeah.  So then what happens, the record weasels run scared, because, you know, they want their band to be as popular as possible, so all of a sudden, all of a sudden, they cannot be contacted anymore.  They're all of a sudden just kind of lost.  They disappear.  They disappear.  Yeah.  Even though all this was in writing.  Yeah.  That's how they operate.  See, this was all in writing in the beginning, because it didn't matter to anyone until we started talking about it on the air. 
[00:16:30]  And it's happened before.  This isn't like the first time this has happened to us, but now it's just like, now we've had it.  We've just had it.  Why do you think we don't get, why do you think we haven't had a hell of a lot of name bands that are popular right now coming through this show?  It's a C block over there at K-Rock.  Well, and I'll go one further without getting into too many details.  We've had celebrities on our show that have nothing to do with music that were threatened. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Saying if you go on O&A, you will not be able to do blah, blah show.  You can't go on K-Rock.  Right.  Now, here's the interesting thing about this.  We're all owned by the same goddamn company.  All under the CBS umbrella.  Yeah.  Okay.  Infinity Broadcasting.  Now, we were promoting the show.  We were promoting the show for three or four weeks.  Yeah.  All they had to do was call our bosses and say, hey, man, you know, you know, putting Buck 
[00:17:30]  Cherry on Opie and Anthony, you know, that's going to kind of hurt us because we're the  music station in town.  Maybe we can work something out.  But they don't even do that.  They make us...  On what planet would that happen?  They make us look like complete tools for three or four weeks promoting the fact that  we're going to have Buck Cherry on our show and our listeners will get to meet him, you  know, at the concert last night.  And then they pull the plug.  And then they pull the plug and play their little games behind the scenes because of the  weasels that they are over there.  And we're left on a Tuesday afternoon looking like complete a-holes. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Not only didn't we didn't get Buck Cherry on the air, we didn't do the meet and greet  last night with our listeners.  Mm-hmm.  And those are the facts, my friends.  That's it.  Those are the facts.  That's what happened.  Steve Kingston, midget.  So then...  K-Rock.  So then today I have Ken Stevens, our general manager, you know, call K-Rock's general manager.  Tom Chiusano.  Courtesy call.  Yeah.  Ken goes, look, we have a problem. 
[00:18:30]  Opie and Anthony are pretty pissed.  You know, and we're in the same company.  All right?  Mm-hmm.  We should try to work something out here.  You know, what are you going to do about this?  And Ken even said, Tom, you have until showtime to call me back so we can work this out behind  the scenes.  Yeah.  The douchebag doesn't even have the, you know, the common courtesy to call our general manager  back to try to work this out.  Mm-hmm.  To try to work through the facts.  Yeah.  Nothing.  So then they leave it to us.  So he goes running and hiding. 
[00:19:00]  So now, since we didn't get any answers, now it comes down to us.  Right.  And our show.  Right.  And how are we going to deal with this problem?  Diplomatically?  Sure.  Why not?  I want everyone to call K-Rod.  There you go.  212-314-9230.  Get your pens and paper.  212-314-9230.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:19:30]  And don't call this once.  Just over and over again.  I just want it to be a complete nightmare over there for the next three or four hours.  Yeah.  And call him up and ask for the Abercrombie and Fitch midget and ask him why he's so scared  of O&A.  Yeah.  That's all.  Why wouldn't he let Buck Cherry on their show?  Ask him some questions.  That's all.  Ask him in that fine, nice way that you guys know how to do.  Serious questions only.  Yeah.  212-314-9230.  If you've ever, ever enjoyed this radio show, we're asking you guys for a favor today. 
[00:20:00]  We don't ask for many favors, do we?  No.  We usually just sit here and try to entertain everybody.  That's all.  Go ahead.  Call him up and ask him why he hid.  We need some answers.  Yeah.  You might not need to call him.  212-314-9230.  Just ask him why.  Why he did that.  Why are they so afraid?  Right. 
[00:20:30]  Hmm.  They better not be dumping out of the number.  212-314-9230.  We'll be back.  More girls, more gooder.  Hookers for everyone.  You want some of this?  Okay.  No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused.  1027. 
[00:21:00]  WNEW.  Boy, that number's busy.  I wonder why.  Hmm.  Looks like no business could be done today.  Hmm.  212-314-9230.  Ask for the Abercrombie and Fitch midget and ask him why he's such a pussy.  Hiding behind his power.  Doesn't have the balls to do it in front of everybody.  Why can't ONA just have a band on the show?  That's all.  You can also call 1-888-923-KROCK. 
[00:21:30]  There you go.  That one will work as well.  1-888-923-KROCK.  That's a request line.  That's what you call to hear the same Pink Floyd tune over and over again.  There you go.  Anthony, the fine folks at Pinnacle Hornigo, we have come up with another product for the ladies called Pinnacle Monkeying Around.  Monkeying Around.  It's for the ladies.  The horny folks at Pinnacle, the makers of Hornigo, we now have something just for women.  It's Pinnacle Monkeying Around.

[00:23:00]  Anyone getting answers to their questions over there?  No, I don't think so.  They're being a bunch of cowards.  A lot of cowards work over there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got to do all their undermining behind the scenes.  We'll do it right in front of everyone.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Call up K-Rock and ask them why they're scared of us. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  We have a contest or giveaway where you're supposed to be able to have a meet and greet with a band.  Why do they got to step in?  What's the problem?  Why?  Just one little band.  Right.  Ask them why they're such pussies.  It's a dopey, sucky show.  I mean, I don't understand why they'd have a problem with a band appearing on a show that, you know, no one listens to and sucks.  212-314-9230. 
[00:24:00]  They're not answering that phone anymore.  It's too bad.  Oh, they'll do it behind the scenes.  They'll have management.  Call our management.  Oh, yeah.  You wait.  Go F yourselves.  We'll let you know what happens behind the scenes.  Let's see.  What other numbers can we give out today?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Can I have any more?  Yeah, I got home numbers.  Do you?  Oh, yeah.  Try dropping those.  I'm going to have to do it in code.  So you're going to have to listen very closely today.  It's like a contest.  You've got to put it together.  And then when you dial it, you see if you get it.  I do have home numbers, though. 
[00:24:30]  Psycho Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I was just curious.  I was just on the Acromi and Fitch show.  I was going to, you know, send Mr. Kingston some catalogs for the new children's lives.  I think they'd fit in perfectly.  I was wondering, do you guys have the address by any chance?  Oh, we will in a few minutes.  Yeah, we'll get that for you.  And a website?  I don't know the website.  You don't have any e-mails by any chance?  No, no.  You do your research.  I'm sure you can pull up a lot of contacts. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, and I'm sure listeners could send plenty of A and F catalogs over to that neck of the woods.  You know, whatever.  You know, the spring line is fantastic.  That would be such a mean thing to do, though, Psycho Mark, you know?  Me?  Me?  We like to play nice.  Me, a miserable mother effer?  They ask with me.  We like serious inquiries only.  Serious questions.  Come on, people.  Keep it above board.  All right, Mark.  I'm sorry.  That was just out of control.  All right.  Keep it nice and professional.  Serious inquiries only, please. 
[00:25:30]  That's right.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, hello.  Hey, you guys want to mess with us?  Come on down.  Who's this?  This is Cappy.  I want to midnight show a team.  This isn't Cappy.  Yeah, Charlie, you son of a bitch.  Cappy.  Bunch of loses.  Cappy's a faggot.  It's not Cappy.  Come on.  You're a break.  Last time we saw Cappy, he kissed our ass.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  He'll act like he doesn't like us and stuff. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, yeah, okay.  We know better, so shut up.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Hey, they're getting real flustered over there already, man.  I got through a few minutes ago.  I asked them a couple of questions.  They asked them when they were going to stop being pussies, and they just said,  I'm not taking this and hung up.  I'm very disappointed at our listeners, man.  I mean, how did Uncle John get through?  That phone should be busy for the next, like, three days.  Yeah.  It was.  I must have called about 15, 15, 18 times.  Finally, it rang.  So, it's happening. 
[00:26:30]  All right, cool.  Thanks.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Very important questions you have to ask.  Yes.  212-314-9230.  Yeah.  John, what's up?  John, what's up?  Hello, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, he's a twat.  He's a twat.  He won't answer the phone.  Of course not.  That's busy.  He'll try to do it behind him.  He was busy.  He was busy.  I got in touch with him before, and he says, who's this?  He's an N.E.W. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, he's fine.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  I don't have a fax number, Ant.  Do you have a fax number?  Someone has to help us with a fax number.  John.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was wondering if you guys had the fax number over there, because I have some paperwork that's  imperative, which gets over to the Abercrombie midget over there.  Yeah, we need the fax number.  Yeah, because I have some serious paperwork that just needs to be filed.  Seems like we're not prepared for our little war today.  Yeah.  Well, throughout the show, we'll give you more numbers.  We'll get a fax number.  Keep it posted. 
[00:27:30]  All right, man.  That's it.  Had it.  Oh, K-Rock's programming direct line.  Oops.  Oh, there we go.  I wonder who just handed this to me.  All right.  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5.  Just ask them.  It's going to have to answer so much soon before I give out home numbers.  And street addresses.  That's always fun.  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5. 
[00:28:00]  There's another number to try, Anthony.  That one might be freed up.  Yeah, because that one, I think, goes past the secretary.  Yeah, it's more of a direct line to programming.  I think we'll be getting a lot of direct lines.  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5, I believe, is a good number to try.  And if it's busy, you just try, you know, later or tomorrow.  Yeah, definitely try tomorrow, starting at 9.  Yeah, start early.  See when they get in.  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5. 
[00:28:30]  That's a good one to call.  Especially if 2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-3-0 is busy.  Chad, what's going on?  Hey, Chad.  Chad.  Turn your radio down and talk, Chad.  Chad.  Hello?  Yeah, turn your radio down.  Oh, this is John, not Chad.  Oh, whatever.  Sorry.  Hey, Austin, I think you're getting lines, you guys, over there.  Why?  Well, I got through on the night, you know, the 800, which request, yeah, the other, and 
[00:29:00]  I'm like, well, I request, what's the matter with this moron midget guy?  All you hear is, Jesus, that's from...  And they hung up the phone.  Yeah.  That's all I got.  Time for the midget to break more gold records over us.  I guess so.  But I think they're getting wise to you, so they're clogging up the phones.  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Later.  Bye.  Break more gold records.  How many gold records have been smashed against his desk?  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening?  Is this the ambiguously gay duo?  Yeah, that's funny.  We've heard that one before.  That's us. 
[00:29:30]  That was good, though.  Really funny.  Good one.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Listen, I was just wondering.  You guys apparently have a really short memory.  You remember last year when K-Rock was doing their gay little promotion for Gorilla Radio  when the song was coming out?  Yeah.  Gorilla Radio.  Yeah.  Right.  And they had the song coming out, and you guys, like, you know, thought it would be funny.  I pissed my pants personally.  I thought it was hysterical.  We told everyone what that was all about, yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  And we also told everyone where the STP show was going to be, yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Is this not a case of you can dish it out, but you can't take it?  No, not really. 
[00:30:00]  Why not?  Because this is the type of things they've been doing to us ever since we got to New York.  Yeah.  I believe that was a retaliation for some other bull crap we were going through.  Yeah.  It's usually based on something they have done to us.  Yeah, because I never realized they had done anything else like that to you.  What else happened?  A ton of things behind the scenes.  Oh, really?  Remember Filter?  They had a really, they had a tough, they weren't too happy with Filter on our show.  Right.  And for some reason, they haven't been back.  All right, Steve.  I appreciate it, guys. 
[00:30:30]  Take it easy.  Okay.  Hmm.  Wow, that's not nice.  K-Rock telling our listeners to go F themselves.  That's never cool.  Come on.  We're all one big happy family.  Why would they do that?  Tony, what's up?  Hey, these guys just told me to go F myself.  Hey, that's not nice.  Guy picks up the phone, 9285, program, and go, hey, what's up?  I go, well, why you done I and ONA, you know, for the show?  Right.  He goes, speaking to the wrong guy.  I go, well, put on the right guy.  Who is it?  He goes, Steve.  I go, put Steve on.  He goes, he's not in.  I go, tell him to get out from underneath his desk.  He goes, go F yourself and click me. 
[00:31:00]  Good.  Aw.  He's probably out getting ice cream.  Getting some ice cream today.  Hey, will you guys have the...  Hey, Tony, what phone did you call?  9285.  That would be what, 212?  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5.  Yeah, because the other number, 2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-3-0, is busy, I guess, huh?  The 9-2-3-0 is busy, and the 9-2-8-5, that little wussy, you know, was defending Kingston,  told me to go F myself.  Of course.  They're all scared of the little midget.  These are like Hitler tactics. 
[00:31:30]  Yes.  These are like Napoleon.  Let me ask you something, guys.  Yeah.  We get together at a lot of parties, and you guys come up alongside other things.  Right.  My nose is a little in the way.  Hold on.  Do you know what I mean?  And everybody says you guys have the clout now and the ability to move to a smaller station  but have the flexibility you want.  Smaller station?  No, not a small...  I mean, a smaller...  It doesn't get much smaller than WNAW.  No, but you don't...  No, I mean...  I mean, we could go on a CB channel if you like. 
[00:32:00]  I mean, away from infinity, stupid, because think about it.  Like, the big bands like Limp Bizkit, they go to an independent label so they have the flexibility  to say what they want.  Right, right.  Everybody always says to me, why don't ONA go to a station where they say what they want?  And we're just curious, because you guys definitely have the credibility to clout in the following now.  Well, we'll see what happens, Tony.  It's going to be interesting.  You know, I think if you guys go balls to the wall, you're going to win, because you got the backing.  All right, man.  We'll see.  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Hey, listen, quick order for you.  Yeah.  What's the worst thing a white guy could call a black guy?  It starts with N and ends with R.  What?  Neighbor.  Neighbor.  Very good.  There you go.  That's supposed to be a Martian joke, though.  I know.  I think we have some audio over there at K-Rock when they're answering the phones.  Yeah.  How'd you like to suck my ass?  That's not very nice.  I can't believe they're doing that over there.  Is he cold?  All right. 
[00:33:00]  Keep calling.  Keep asking those questions.  Oh, I know his real last name is Kersner.  Everyone knows that.  What?  It's still part of the radio thing that people do.  They change their names so it kind of sounds nondescript, non-ethnic or anything.  Sure.  Leave it to him to change his name to King, Stan.  Yeah.  I think he got a little carried away with that.  That's what that title.  That's what small people with small penises do. 
[00:33:30]  They have to change their name, get really large cars.  Because Kersner just wasn't cool enough.  Well, he's already a Don Kersner.  Hey, I'm going to name myself King, Stan.  King?  Because I'm the king of doing nothing.  King?  Except programming the same 150 songs.  Hey, retro rock.  Come on.  You want to hear the same Pink Floyd song over and over again?  That's a stroke of genius.  Michael, what's going on?  Oh, well, I got through on 314-9230 and asked them why Buck Cherry and Monster Magnet couldn't be with ONA, and they just hung up on me. 
[00:34:00]  No, Monster Magnet, they had the balls to come on our show anyway.  No.  It was the whole Buck Cherry thing.  Oh, they just don't want to hear it.  That's too bad.  And you called what?  212?  3-1-4-9-2-3-0.  Hey, look at that.  That's the number I got.  Hmm.  Huh.  Did you try 2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5?  Oh, yes.  I was busy.  I was going back and forth.  Well, you might have to call tomorrow, because I think a lot of people are calling right now to question. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  We'll try again.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  No!  No, really.  We're one happy family, right?  Exactly.  Mm-hmm.  That's what I do with my own family.  I punch them in the face really hard.  Kick them in the nuts.  Goddamn.  Bunch of worms.  Let me see.  Hmm. 
[00:35:00]  Are we getting new information or new numbers?  New information.  Supposedly, he has his employees call.  Makes his employees.  Please call him the king.  I'm the king.  That's sad.  That is sad.  All right.  All right.  This is good.  Okay.  This is real good.  But we're not getting answers. 
[00:35:30]  I don't give a crap.  The sad part is we gave them all day to at least call our boss and explain, you know, why they did what they did.  Yeah.  And they didn't feel like, you know, calling us back for some reason.  We were somewhat, uh...  Almost playing by the rules.  Hey, everyone, happy family.  Why don't you call us back?  Hmm.  Instead of trying to whack us behind your back.  Behind our backs.  They obviously...  They obviously...  I mean, yeah, it's the same company, but they obviously want this place to be a total failure. 
[00:36:00]  It's a complete failure now.  But the total failure would be horrible.  Ryan, what's going on?  Yeah, I just got through and now you have to enter your party's extension.  Uh, so that sucks.  No live answer.  All these people trying to do business with the station now and they don't get a live voice.  Hmm.  No.  That kind of blows when you do that to a company.  Yeah.  Can't get much done that way.  And which number did you try?  212...  That was 930.  Uh, 314-9230. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, keep calling it, though.  They'll have to answer eventually.  Oh, of course.  I would suggest you start calling again tomorrow at 9 a.m.  Oh.  That's when business really is, uh...  Really important, you know?  Just keep calling until you get an answer you're satisfied with.  Yeah.  You don't want them to mistake a call for someone else, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were quite embarrassed and looked like a-holes last night.  Yeah.  In front of our listeners, so...  Ask them why.  Well, I mean, who's really going to see Buck Cherry anyway, though?  Why is K-Rock so scared of us?  Yeah, we're just a crappy show. 
[00:37:00]  Well, I was to have a little band on the radio.  Yeah, we suck, right?  We suck.  They say that all the time.  We're nothing.  But for some reason...  They want to keep any personalities from coming on the show.  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5.  That's a really good number to have.  Yeah.  Really good.  Ask for Mr. Kirshner.  Mr. Kirshner, yeah.  Ask for Lil...  Lil Mr. Kirshner.  The little guy. 
[00:37:30]  Hey, we just wanted a phone call today to explain why you did what you did.  Oh, you'll deny it, of course.  Of course.  What do you do all the time, Lil Weasel?  Yeah.  Want to take a break, yeah?  Yeah.  We could do that.  Let's go to Andy.  Andy, what's up?  Yo, I'm calling for a complete ban on all of K-Rock. 
[00:38:00]  Not one O&A listener should be doing anything but calling up K-Rock and cursing them out.  Aside from that, do not listen to K-Rock.  Andy, you know, I've got to defend them.  You know, it's a great radio station if you have Alzheimer's.  Yeah, tell me about it.  And you forget what you just heard a half hour ago?  Right.  Yeah.  Great station to listen to if you have a short-term memory problem.  Yeah, seriously.  Come on.  If they play the same, what, two songs over and over again?  All right.  It'll be a friggin' break.  Thank you.  Do not listen to them.  All right, guys.  Bye. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, fax number, 212-314-9338.  212-314-9338.  Hmm.  Yeah?  Well, we've got promotional numbers to give out in a little while, too.  All right.  Hope you guys are writing all these numbers down.  Yeah, write them down until you get an answer that you're satisfied with.  Hey, you can call them.  Yeah, you should answer every single one of our listeners.  Yeah.  If they have questions to ask, you can ask any question you want, by the way.  Don't have to just stick with this one. 
[00:39:00]  No, anything you might be curious about.  Serious questions only.  And I highly recommend you call tomorrow.  Be courteous and professional, please.  Yes.

New York.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  It's the O&A show.  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on.  Come on.  Still not getting an answer from K-Rock. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, well.  Why they're being a bunch of pussies behind our back and undermining our show.  Come on, come on.  Our crappy show.  We have it on Good Word that they prevented Buck Cherry from coming on our show.  And prevented Buck Cherry from doing a meet and greet with our contest winners last night at the Vanderbilt.  On Long Island.  And it seems to be the work of the Abercrombie and Fitzmidchen that are known as Steve Kirschner. 
[00:42:00]  Come on, come on.  Come on, come on.  Come on.  Kirschner, Kushner.  Kushner.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I guarantee he gave himself that name.  I'm the king.  I'm going to call myself King-Sin.  So we've been giving out a phone number.  We can't get through now.  Call tomorrow.  We encourage that you call tomorrow. 
[00:42:30]  Please, don't forget this, all right?  Right.  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5.  Ask them what the problem is.  Why are they scared of O&A?  To the point that they're preventing bands from coming on our show.  We're supposed to be one happy family.  I thought we were supposed to work together, right?  That's what happens.  That guy's on the instant feedback.  Some guy's got a good idea.  We should just, we should play a rock block and new music. 
[00:43:00]  There you go.  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-3-0.  Yeah, that's a good number, too, I believe.  Okay.  People are getting a little bored with this, Anthony.  I understand that.  Yeah.  We should move on to other things for now.  I'd just like to let you know what's going on behind the scenes at this company.  I've got to tell you something, though, man.  Yeah.  I've got to admit something on the radio today.  It's going to be a little embarrassing.  Yeah.  But what the hell?  We're always admitting things on the show, right?  Sure.  All right. 
[00:43:30]  There's this broad.  Yeah.  That does morning radio.  Yeah.  Sorry to the sports guys.  Hey, they've got a good show and all, but this broad has a hot, hot voice.  Yeah.  Really hot.  Extremely hot.  Name is Patty something.  Patty PLJ or something, right?  What's her last name?  Patty Steele?  Yeah.  Patty Steele.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Hot voice. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Hot, hot, hot.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it's a dragger.  You can tell by the way she talks.  Hot.  Nice drag on that lip.  We can admit stuff today on the show, right?  Mm-hmm.  If you guys want to admit stuff, that's cool.  212-757-1027.  I'll start.  All right.  You know, I love the sports guys and stuff, but I am drawn to this voice.  It's really hot.  And I whack it every morning to Patty Steele. 
[00:44:30]  I can't even believe you're saying this.  I whack it to Patty Steele, and I encourage all our listeners to tune in tomorrow and whack it.  You know what?  I'm not surprised that you're saying this, because it's kind of, you know, it's something personal.  But I got to say, I do the same thing.  You're whacking it to Patty Steele, too?  I wake up just in time to catch the end of our show, and she starts talking with that silky voice.  Oh, yeah.  I just got to grab a handful of lotion and just pound one out. 
[00:45:00]  I imagine some sick stuff while I'm doing it.  Yeah.  I mean, I can't help myself.  The voice is hot.  I wake up with the morning you-know-what.  Yeah.  Can't help myself.  Patty Steele.  I crank up the radio as loud as it goes and whack it to Patty Steele.  And just slam it.  I mean, really, I'm pounding it.  Oh, yeah.  It's nasty stuff.  Sometimes twice.  Like before she gets off the air?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  You can get two in, really?  Yeah.  With me, the first one's so good.  Really?  First of all, I got to clean the ceiling, because you know what happened?  I don't need to go a second round.  Until the next morning.  Then you hear her again.  If I was PLJ, I would get some promos on the air.  Yeah.  Whack it to Patty Steele.  Yeah, that's a hot voice.  Sounds like a goa.  I like that.  Hottest voice.  I'm telling you.  All silky.  She missed her calling.  She should be doing phone sex. 
[00:46:00]  Phone sex.  She should be making a bloody fortune.  It's pretty much his phone sex.  It's like radio sex.  Because I don't know any guy that probably isn't just spanking a batch listening to Patty  Steele.  Anyone else with me?  I mean, am I crazy?  I'm kind of surprised you brought it up.  Stink, would you like to whack it to Patty Steele tomorrow?  Dude, I have PLJ on my alarm clock for when I wake up.  I hear her.  Oh, you hear her, too?  Yeah.  See?  Are you rubbing one out, too?  I don't want to.  Oh, I thought I was alone on this one.  No. 
[00:46:30]  How could you resist?  When Patty Steele's talking, I'm just thinking, I've got to let one fly.  It's like free phone sex.  Right.  Exactly.  You think really dirty stuff when you're doing it, though?  Filthy.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Get in there.  What's the problem, Rick?  Nothing.  It's embarrassing.  Why?  Because I just don't...  That's why I usually get up early in the morning.  You know, Linda's still sleeping.  I sneak into the bathroom and pop on the radio. 
[00:47:00]  Are you trying to tell me you whack it to Patty Steele, too?  Aside from this job, I guess that's the only thing all of us have in common.  Yeah.  With all the hot girls we have in this studio.  Yeah.  You would think we'd be whacking it to that girl from yesterday.  Abigail or whatever.  No.  No.  No.  She didn't have the voice.  She didn't have the voice.  Then you can pull up her pick on WPLJ.com and just bang out another one.  No.  See, that wrecks the fantasy.  Does it?  Yeah.  The voice doesn't match the face.  It's always the case on radio.  Look at that.  You just wrecked my fantasy, you douche. 
[00:47:30]  No, that's all right right there.  That's not bad.  All right.  Steve?  You have a confession today?  Yeah.  You know, actually, what I do is I run tape every morning and I keep the tapes in my studio  so I can crank them out while I'm working.  Ah.  See?  During the day.  So when you're putting the paper over the window to your studio, you're in there whacking  it.  Yeah.  That's really what I'm doing.  In the case of Patty Steele.  Yeah.  As I'm cutting the commercials.  That's nice, right?  I've got that going into my headphones.  Nice. 
[00:48:00]  Works for me.  Mm-hmm.  Then we're done.  Then we're done.  All right.  Well, we all spank out batches to a Patty Steele in the morning.  Howie?  Yes.  What's going on?  Guys, Patty Steele is the Abercrombie Midget's wife.  What?  Are you serious?  Stop.  I used to work promotions at Z100 and that's his wife.  Stop it.  He is a douche.  I crashed the van and they told me they couldn't afford my $5 an hour salary and had to let 
[00:48:30]  me go.  You know, we wanted to get off of that subject.  Life is weird sometimes, you know?  It takes weird twists and turns.  What a strange coincidence that is, huh?  Absolutely bizarre.  Who saw that coming?  Everyone's whacking it to his wife.  Wow.  All right.  Sure didn't see that coming.  How much of a coincidence is that? 
[00:49:00]  Scary.  X-Files-ish.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Huh.  Well, if you want to admit it to K-Rock Programming, their line is 2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5.  Huh.  Can't wait for the SIG picks.  Let's go to Jeff.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Hey, listen, I just wanted to let you know, I whacked it off to Allison Steele, too.  Allison?  Allison Steele?  Yeah.  You sick F. 
[00:49:30]  Isn't that who you're talking to?  She's been dead for years.  She's 6'2".  Allison Steele?  Dead?  Yeah, you check.  Get out of here.  If you could get around the worms, maybe it's doable.  Oh, man.  What the hell, man?  I like it with the worms.  She's dead.  She's kidding.  You idiot?  Oh, man.  That's not who you're talking about?  We're not talking about Allison Steele.  No.  The Nightbird did have a hot voice.  Yeah.  But there's something about the Patty Steele voice.  Mm-mm-mm-mm. 
[00:50:00]  Al, what's going on?  I'm going to jail.  I am going to jail for you guys.  I finally got through.  3-1-4-9-2-8-5.  And I told them my name was Tom Collins, vice president over at Stack or Two, and I demand  to know what's going on.  They transferred me to another woman who turned out to be a real C. So I gave her a couple  of, I'm over here now, and don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  She said, the owner of that cell phone is going to be arrested by the authorities.  Oh, yeah.  We're tracing your call.  Yeah.  What did you do wrong?  I don't know.  It's very nice, courteous. 
[00:50:30]  We're tracing your call.  Just like you guys demanded.  That's like, that's like when you were 12 and you made a prank call.  I'm calling mommy on you.  I know, right?  All right.  I'm going to trace your call, and the police will be over there.  And then you...  Anyway, guys, just to let you know, I'm going to jail for you.  Thank you, man.  And I'll call you from jail.  There's nothing they can do, though.  But remember that?  They would threaten that they were going to call the cops and get you, and then you'd hang  up the phone, and you'd sit there for the rest of the day, like...  They'd be scared.  Freaked out, thinking there's got to be a way they can find out the number.  I'm tracing. 
[00:51:00]  This is before caller ID and everything.  Where you would just call, and then they'd go, I just traced that call, and the police  will be over there in a minute.  And you're a kid, you slam the phone down.  Oh, no.  And now you're in the backyard going, oh, the cops are too far.  Dave, what's going on?  Hi, I'm sorry to bother you guys.  I know you're doing a radio show, but I didn't catch both the phone numbers for K-Rock.  Is it possible you could give it to me again?  Yeah, we're kind of trying to move on.  I'm assuming you guys all have the number, and you'll call tomorrow, because it doesn't  seem like they're being too cooperative right now.  I work at a big company, and I have a great phone, so I have redial on all 10 lines, so 
[00:51:30]  I'm going to just keep drawing on all 10 lines.  Can I have those two numbers again, please?  All we asked was for them to call us back and explain why they're C-blocking us.  Yeah, when it comes to Buck Cherry and other bands, and other guests for that matter, because  it's been told to us by some of the guys you know and love from this show that they've  been threatened by K-Rock.  Go on that show.  You can't go on this show.  But we're supposed to be one happy family.  So we said, hey, could you please give Ken Stevens a call and explain what the hell's 
[00:52:00]  going on before Opie and Anthony go on the radio today and lose their effing minds?  Right.  Thank you.  And did we get an answer?  No.  Let me give them a call.  You got that number again?  Yeah, just be nice, okay?  I'll be very nice.  Very cordial.  All right.  The programming direct line is 2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5.  Okay.  9-2-8-5.  And the fax number, please.  Yeah, where is that fax number?  Hmm.  The fax number is always good to have.  Rick, you got that again?  Thanks, boys.  Oh, wait.  I think I have it over here.  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-3-3-8. 
[00:52:30]  Beautiful.  Thanks, Colson.  All right.  Bye.  C-Blocker.  You see Paul on line, too?  O&A think Midget looks like Master Blaster from Beyond Thunderdome.  Remember that one?  Yeah.  Who run K-Rock?  Master Blaster run K-Rock.  Hey, P, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I was calling that number a thousand times, the 9-2-3-0-1.  Yeah.  And it kept being busy, so I decided to play around, and I dialed 9-2-3-0-1.  It was 9-2-3-1, and it went right to Tom's office.  Tom Chiasano, the guy that was supposed to call Ken Stevens back. 
[00:53:00]  What a coincidence.  And what's that number again?  It's 2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-3-1.  Really?  Yeah.  And she didn't seem like she knew what was going on, so maybe you can...  Oh.  Very strange.  We'll add that to the numbers.  Right on.  2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-3-1, I believe you said?  See you?  Thank you, Pete.  See you, guys.  All right.  All right.  I think we're making some headway here.  I can't believe you whack it to Patty Steele like myself. 
[00:53:30]  Who doesn't?  That silky voice.  I like that.  Just spank it.  Like I'm punching my yam bag.  I just slam it so hard to that voice.  Right.  Sure.  Gina.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Hey, I finally got through to that number.  Yeah.  And they really weren't sure who Openee and Anthony were and is it N.E.W.?  That's really strange.  I've never heard of them.  Huh.  And then they thought about maybe taking a message, but I asked them who they'd give it to. 
[00:54:00]  Well, what number did you call that?  They didn't know who we were.  It must have been.  That was 2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-8-5.  And they didn't know who we were.  That's very strange.  No.  Never heard of W-N-E-W.  Yeah.  When they were trying to hire us, that's the same number they gave me.  Isn't that funny?  Yeah.  That's a little weird.  Okay.  Strange.  Yeah.  But they finally did do the right thing and hung up on me.  All right.  Did you try 2-1-2-3-1-4-9-2-3-1?  You know what?  I'll probably have to do that.  Yeah.  Please do that, Gina.  Terrific.  Especially if you really enjoy the O&A show. 
[00:54:30]  Of course.  Okay.  Who doesn't?  Thank you.  Have a great day.  Bye.  Bye.  Who's Zooty Bang?  Zooty Bang.  Yo.  What's up?  Guys, this is the day we've been waiting for.  This is the radio we knew you could do.  Yeah.  It's perfect.  The board's going nuts for you.  Well, thank you.  Keep up the good work, bro.  There you go.  I hope you have all the phone numbers up on O.P. Anthony.  Oh, you know I got them.  I hope someone's paying attention over there.  All right.  We all got them, bro.  Thank you.  Take care.  Zooty Bang.  Yo. 
[00:55:00]  Hmm.  So you really whacked it to her, too, huh?  Yeah.  And then I didn't believe Steve, so I just ran over into a studio because he walked out  and I looked around and I found the tape and I put it in and I blasted out another one.  You might as well.  It doesn't take much just hearing that voice.  Exactly.  That's nice.  I'll reload and I'll be back in 20 minutes.  Screw it.  We'll all make mayonnaise tomorrow morning.  Elmer's glue to listen to PLJ tomorrow morning.  Like a car wash with no running water.  Make your own Elmer's glue. 
[00:55:30]  All right.  Well, I was trying to change the subject there, but look what happened.  Very strange coincidence happened.  Just when you try to get out, you got pulled back in again.  Huh.  Old Dirty.  Yo, yo.  What's up, man?  It's the Illmatic, son.  What's going on?  What's up, bro?  Where you been?  Where I been, bro?  I got a whole itinerary on my plate, car.  You don't know what's been going on.  Itinerary.  Yo, yo, yo, PR, if you're listening, man, I got your leather bag, but it's kind of beat up. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  Sorry about that.  Yo, what's up with K-Rock, son?  Again with these people?  With the whole management thing?  Well, dirty trick.  Bunch of pussies.  And then their jocks are not allowed to say anything, which is pretty funny.  Yeah, that is funny.  If you fellas go to a smaller market, I'm packing my duffel bags, kid.  Oh, yeah.  No smaller market.  Oh, yeah.  We'll be moving, yeah, out of the area.  Sure we will.  Of course.  That's what happens.  Yo, so, yo, man, I ain't shaking nobody's hand the next time I go into that studio, man. 
[00:56:30]  All right, old Dirty.  Brother's got mayonnaise on your hand.  Well, we all whack it to Patty Steele.  We got something in common.  Who are you?  Patty Steele.  Turns out to be the midget's wife.  Who knew?  What?  Yeah.  Hey, kids, that works down the line from you?  Supposedly your boss?  Man, you are so out there.  What the hell have you been listening to?  Dude, yo, man, I had to go out of state to, you know.  Yeah, correction.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He's out of his mind. 
[00:57:00]  Let's go to Lewis.  The Lewis.  Lewis!  Hey, dude.  The frustration in their voice is amazing.  I got through twice.  So I'm sitting in my office.  I flip the radio on full blast.  And just as they pick up the line, I hit the speakerphone.  Put the headset against.  And they hear your voices.  And I just hear the...  And then hang up.  All we asked for was a phone call to explain what the hell was going on the last week.  Help us out.  What a bunch of jack-offs.  All right.  A bunch of gutless jack-offs.  Hey, Lewis, what number did you call?  I called 314-9285. 
[00:57:30]  314-9285.  Please call sometime soon.  And our operators will be standing by.  That's a good one.  But an even better one is the 212-314-9231.  Yeah, I can ask him.  You know, I can get some pointers on golf chipping.  Bye, Lewis.  He's out playing golf.  All right.  Hey, we could end this.  I mean, you know, call Ken and explain yourself before we start giving out home numbers.  I hate to do that. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, call up.  That always sucks.  You know, you're listening over there.  Call up Ken Stevens and give a viable explanation to this whole thing.  We called you first thing this morning.  You had six hours to give a courtesy call back to explain yourself.  Because we'll start with a zip code and work backwards.  That's always fun.  Right?  Absolutely.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, O.N.?  All right. 
[00:58:30]  You know, these fax machines today, the technology is pretty impressive.  And there's probably a couple of good things you can do when you play around with them.  Yeah, like what?  Well, I had a friend of mine who got pissed off at somebody and sent them a fax.  And he taped about ten pages together.  And as the fax goes through the machine, he pulled the piece coming out and taped it to the piece going in, so it looped.  Oh, yeah.  It's the endless fax.  Endless.  I've heard about that.  And even if they disconnect you today, you know, everything gets stored in a memory.  They run out of paper.  They could get faxes coming out for days unless they know how to clear out the memory. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, they're pretty smart.  They'll probably disconnect the fax line for a little while, right?  Well, you know, you can always set yours to redial a certain amount of times.  All right.  Well, don't do that.  Of course not.  Of course not.  They could have faxes for days.  Yeah, because we only fight fair.  Right.  That would be bad.  Don't do whatever you do.  Don't do that.  All right.  All right.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  All right.  Well, I think we did our job there. 
[00:59:30]  Serious faxes only.  Of course.  Of course.  This is how we play.  It's fun, right?  I think so.  Yeah.  It's a lot of fun.  All right.  We'll take a break and we'll see if we can move on maybe a little bit.  Yeah.  Without somehow a coincidence pulling us back into this.  Remember, you're listening to two guys that whack it to Patty Steele.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:00:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You will never see a more wretched hive of gum and villainy.  One, oh, two, seven.  I'm going to see you.  W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  What do you think of the names Jake, Katie, and Will?  That sounds nice.  What, Rick?  I'm thinking of having kids soon.  It's never too early to, you know, figure out the names.  Nice choice.

[01:01:30]  Trickery to white devil.  Purple diarrhea.  Purple diarrhea.  You guys are making me assy sick over here.  This stuff is terrifying, man.  I think people that call radio stations are losers.  Opie and Anthony.  Bringing out the best in it, people.  Today.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Bring out the best in people every day. 
[01:02:00]  Dan from Hoboken.  Damn, I thought I was the only one who whacked us with Patty Steele.  Holy S.  Ha.  Even Dan.  Today I learned Patty Steele at PLC is porn for the blind.  You could call it that.  Old Dirty is feeling hurt. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, man.  What up, man?  It's just a little animosity towards my person on the part of Opie, man.  A little dirty.  You don't even know what's happening on the show.  I wasn't listening.  I had a little time out of state, my brother.  You picked the wrong day to call in just casually.  We're in the middle of a little battle here.  Yeah, I heard it.  I stopped, bro.  Now you're figuring it out.  The whole management thing again, man.  But oh, I'm going to get back in the groove, you know what I'm saying?  I just haven't been able to, you know. 
[01:03:00]  Where are you calling from?  I'm in the street, man.  I'm in an unknown location.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  Game Bond?  It just, yo, things just don't procrastinate, you know what I'm saying?  Man.  What's wrong with you today, old dirty?  Nah, you do, you know.  Man, I feel a little hurt, Opie, man.  The last time I called you, man, the day before you went on vacation, we had two fat chicks  that work at Bo Weiser.  Oh, the retard of the burn show.  Yeah, man.  I called in real early, man.  Talk about surviving and all that. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  You called this to me.  Oh, he was on hold for a long time.  Yeah, B.  I know I'm the lowest man on the pedal, you know what I'm saying?  But, you know, give me some love, dude.  Leave me on for 15 minutes.  We're talking four minutes.  Yo, I gotta drop in a corner every four minutes, my brother.  There are too many people associated with this show that have, like, shallow egos.  My ego ain't shallow, son.  We had a busy show that day, I remember, with the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  It's tough to talk to you on the phone when we have, like, 20 people in the studio.  I remember the day like it happened yesterday. 
[01:04:00]  There was a ton of things going on.  Well, but you cold-hearted, white boy, Opie.  That's my word, man.  You're like my last boss.  We love the old dirty.  And it was just before vacation.  Why weren't you in here partying with him?  Yeah.  No, man.  We're insulting.  Good one, Opie.  I had a little problems out of state, man.  I had to go, you know, I had to go take care of you.  Let me tell you something.  What the hell was that, a fart or a motorcycle?  I don't know, man.  It could have been.  Where are you, uptown? 
[01:04:30]  It was a Corolla 1.E with a straight pipe exhaust.  It was a biplane over old dirty feds.  It sounded like, yo, B, they're crop dusting here.  They be crop dusting.  The feds are coming down on me, B.  Yo, the feds don't even, don't say that out loud out here, kid.  Where are you, uptown?  Nah, nah, nah.  Nothing but love for the old dirty.  No, no, no, no, no, I got nothing but love for one day, yo.  We've been in the game for three years, man.  You know what I mean?  I've been pure management fallouts and, yo, been through all that, son. 
[01:05:00]  You can't, you know, you can't dismiss me yet.  You know what I mean?  Old dirty.  What up, dog?  You're the weakest link.  Goodbye.  Ah, yo, don't you hate that show?  That old bitch, yo.  So like my third, third, third grade old third grade teacher, man.  Hang on, weakest link.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  She doesn't open her mouth, yo.  See that?  No reason to.  Someone has got to slap that lady across the face.  She's a bitch.  As they're taking that walk of shame. 
[01:05:30]  Wow, NBC ain't rolling nothing for snake eyes the last two months, huh?  That show is going to be cool for about three.  Three shows.  It wasn't even cool toward the end of the first show.  We were just watching it.  I have some interest in it, but it's going to get old fast.  But toward the end, I was just like, all right, enough already.  That was annoying after a while.  She reminds me of the rules one goddamn more time.  I'm going to crap myself.  Yo, dude, speaking about game shows, I took the only IQ test, kid. 
[01:06:00]  What's that?  I took an ill IQ test because I want to donate my sperm.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  You decide you want to donate your sperm?  Yeah.  You're doing it for humanity.  I'm doing humanity of service.  You're doing it for the money, obviously.  Oh, no doubt.  A buck fifty or four.  Hello?  All right.  How did you find out about this?  Yo, one of my sources came through on the Rolodex and let me know when I went in and took  an IQ test, he sampled my demon seed, I'm waiting for him to get back to me. 
[01:06:30]  I thought in your community that was just called dating.  Yo, man, I got an extra large belt for 2001, man.  Spring 2K.  Hey, did you hear our new Martian joke yesterday?  Yeah, huh?  Yeah, huh?  You heard the Martian joke yesterday?  What do you mean to repeat it?  I heard it a little while ago.  We didn't say it a little while ago.  The neighbor joke, right?  Nah.  Nah.  All right, which one is that?  What do you call a Martian girl getting an abortion? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, what you call it, Opie?  A crime stop.  Why?  It's a Martian joke.  Oh, God.  Yo, how's everything?  That's good, right?  So you're going to donate your seed?  Yeah, yo.  I got a high IQ, too, sir.  How much did he get for the seed?  Yo, I'm talking.  I want it.  The lowest I'll go is 80 bucks a batch.  You're not going to be able to give your own price.  Yo, why not?  I'm hustling.  I think it's 20 bucks a whatever, yeah. 
[01:07:30]  A sample.  What I'm dropping is special.  What do you mean special?  What's so special about yours?  Special.  They're doing a DNA analysis.  They got like a whole bat cave set up.  It's crazy.  I'm telling you.  So you already did the thing into a cup?  Yeah, I'm going to multiply my seed all over the earth.  Brother.  It's going to come through.  And my IQ is high, man.  Yo, see, I'm genius. 
[01:08:00]  Wait, wait.  You took an IQ test?  Yeah.  And what did it come out?  A buck 20.  A buck 20?  Yeah.  All right.  I'll test your IQ.  How do you spell earth?  Yo, man.  Yo, you know I will curse, man.  But they probably dump out of me and all that.  Earth.  I just want to make sure you know how to, you know, spell earth.  E-A-R-G-H.  Earth.  Earth.  Earth.  All right.  Well, obviously, you know that you can have a high IQ, but be ignorant in the way of your  spelling.  I'm not ignorant. 
[01:08:30]  Are you crazy?  Well, maybe you're ignorant.  No, you can do that, but still have an IQ.  Like your intelligence can be high.  But if you haven't learned something, then, uh, if you are, if you haven't learned something,  then, uh, you, you're Ignat in that, uh, subject.  Yeah.  I'm ready to.  How does one spell Ignat?  Yo, yo, dude.  Yo, I gotta get off, man.  I got final 10 seconds, dude.  Is it all right if I come through the line?  Wait.  What do you mean final 10 seconds?  Where are you?  I'm on the payphone.  I love that. 
[01:09:00]  There ain't nothing better than the click of the payphone when they're trying to say something.  All dirty.  You're the weakest link.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Now, you, of course, all dirty.  Come in tomorrow.  You ran out of time on that phone card.  Damn.  Yeah, we were watching that show before, and I, you like to do that.  All dirty.  Stinky has a whole thing on it.  Stinky was the one getting pissed off at the TV.  He was really getting annoyed with the show.  We're watching it, and the whole concept, at the beginning, when she spells out the rules, 
[01:09:30]  I was like, what?  What?  See, if you yell bank, you'll bank the money.  And then you start again from the bottom and try to build your chain of eight correct answers.  What?  What?  What?  And then the whole millionaire rip-up, with the lights and everything.  But as they start playing it, then I started understanding the rules.  Can I tell you something?  Before we get into the weakest link, the reason a lot of game shows fail miserably is because  they make it too complicated. 
[01:10:00]  When you're watching a game show on TV, you just want to kind of relax, and you want it  as simple as possible.  You're right.  When she went over the rules, it was like, so if I bank it before I, and then it drops  down, but then it builds up again.  What?  I like card sharks.  21.  Right.  21.  I was watching Match Game on the game show channel.  Match Game.  Match the celebrities.  Very easy.  That's an easy game.  Hollywood Squares.  It's Tic-Tac-Toe, goddammit.  What's the matter? 
[01:10:30]  No, they don't want to say it's Tic-Tac-Toe.  Oh, what?  What, what, what, what?  Hollywood Squares, yeah.  They try to clear all the connections to Tic-Tac-Toe.  There's a big Tic-Tac-Toe board, and it's X's and O's.  But they don't want to tie them with Tic-Tac-Toe, god forbid.  So, Stink, what's your take on the weakest link?  It's so dumb.  There's no point to watch it.  All the people are dumb.  Her little stupid remarks.  Like, how many weeks can I watch her make fun of the people? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, you're a flight attendant?  You better fly out of here, because you're the weak.  Like, oh.  That's wacky.  Good fight.  And then at the end, they ask the people why you kicked out the person.  They're like, you go to college, right?  Do you think he would make go to college?  No, because he hesitated on an answer.  What does that have to do with going to college?  Yeah, their answers are really stupid as to why they kicked one person off.  Yeah, they've known the people for, in some cases, the first round for two minutes.  I don't know.  She looks like a whore.  That's why I decided to, because a lot of drag on that lower lip, I'll say, vote her 
[01:11:30]  off.  Yeah, I was bummed they voted off the black bartender.  She had something going on there.  And you could tell.  You could at least keep her for a while, because she's got the good cleavage.  You could tell the people that get booted off and have to take the walk of shame, the  walk of shame away from their podium.  Goodbye.  And then they walk of shame off.  When they have a little clip of them saying how angry they were being voted off, and they  think, Renee should have been voted off because, my God, I gave more answers. 
[01:12:00]  You could tell they kind of have a basic idea of how they feel.  Then they present that to the writers.  The writers then write their lines for them that they then recite like bad actors.  Because you could tell they're acting, and it's bad.  That portion of the program was a little like, oh, please.  Haven't we taken the whole voting someone off idea to the limit?  Not until it's death.  You can't have a game show without voting someone off now. 
[01:12:30]  The only way it would be exciting now is death.  You have people, and when they're voted off, they actually die.  That's the only thing that would be exciting now.  Every show now, they've got to vote people off.  I hear Friends is getting into it.  They're going to vote a cast member off every week.  Vote a cast member off.  That would be good.  Jeez.  Enough with the voting off.  We get it.  I say Ross first.  Ross?  He's annoying.  All right.  And then Joey.  Chandler's funny.  Rachel definitely stays to the end because, God damn, it could be 90 degrees, and those 
[01:13:00]  things will still be popping like turkey timers.  Did you see those things?  Through anything.  That's breast implants for you.  Through sweaters, though.  Breast implants, they stay, you know, the nips have to, you know, boing, boing, boing.  She does have great ones, man.  And she still looks good.  A couple of the other ones are getting a little long in the tooth, they call it.  Long in the tooth, right?  Mm-hmm.  Like that Courtney Cox.  I liked her.  She was kind of cute in the Bruce Springsteen video when she's dancing in the dark.  And now it's like she's too skinny. 
[01:13:30]  She's kind of getting, I don't know.  I don't like the look.  And the other one, the blonde, she hit the wall.  Kudrow.  Kudrow.  Lisa Kudrow.  Yeah, that's over.  The only time she looks kind of cute is at the beginning when she's dancing on the fountain,  but that's from the first season.  I was like, what happened?  You were hot?  212-757-1027.  Let's go to Rob.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  How are you?  Hey.  Bringing up, going back to how you made your little confession before and everyone agreed 
[01:14:00]  with you.  Yeah, we're doing confessions today, I guess.  Sure.  I want to know if I'm the only one that attempts and occasionally succeeds at having phone  sex with his girlfriend's friends.  You have phone sex with your girlfriend's friends?  Well, I try as often as possible and there have been a few times where I actually have  succeeded.  How do you pull that one off?  Well, you've got to pick one that isn't very loyal.  Obviously.  Neither are you.  No, I mean, I'm keeping it to myself. 
[01:14:30]  That's the point.  You know, I mean, I'm not spanking a batch on her.  Right.  I'm just on the phone.  Okay.  You guys never try any of this before?  No, but how do you determine her loyalty and if she's going to rat you out?  Well, you've got to get a feeling for her.  I mean, if you're alone in a room or if you're at a party and all of them are there,  if she's the one kind of giving you eyes or she's the one that's just a little bit more  flirty maybe than the rest of them, the one that maybe annoys your girlfriend the most  because your girlfriend knows that she's not loyal, that's the one you get away with 
[01:15:00]  it.  So your girlfriend goes home and you call up her friends and...  No, no.  No, no.  Her friends will call my place looking for her.  Yeah.  And I'll just kind of casually talk to them and, you know, what do you want?  What kind of panties you got on?  You know.  Look how smooth you are.  You feel it out that way?  Yeah.  Yeah, it works.  I mean, rarely, but, you know.  I don't know if we're going to get too many people confessing that today.  Yeah.  Well, maybe now that I brought it up, you know, the floodgates will open up. 
[01:15:30]  All right.  There you go.  Rob.  Thank you, boys.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  There are the moments that you can determine loyalty between friends of a girlfriend or  even family members because that kind of brought up something I completely forgot about.  Many years ago, I remember my teens was in high school and I was over at my girlfriend's  house and she had her cousin visiting from Washington, I think it was.  And this girl was completely coming on to me.  Like, I mean, ridiculous.  Nice.  Because I guess she was only going to be in town for a weekend. 
[01:16:00]  And I was like, oh, my God, this is her cousin.  And she's completely trying to stab her in the back by having me, you know, stab her in  the front.  Yeah.  And I didn't bite, though, Opie.  No?  I didn't bite.  How old were you?  I don't know.  Like 17?  I got a bite.  But you know why I didn't?  Got a nibble.  No.  I didn't bite because I was like, no, this is the bad thing to do.  I was sure I was being set up.  It was too good.  Too good. 
[01:16:30]  I was sure she was going to go, do you know what that scumbag was trying to do?  And maybe she was.  And maybe she was setting you up.  And then she goes home.  So now you can't get a piece of that pie.  Right.  And the pie you got at home.  And maybe there was a little conference between my girlfriend and her saying, look, you come  on to him and you tell me what happens.  And then she must have went back and said, hey, he's good.  He didn't do anything.  At which point she went and effed my best friend.  Thank you.  I should have railed him.  Especially at 17.  I know.  You shouldn't be faithful at 17. 
[01:17:00]  Ever, ever, ever, ever, never, ever, ever.  Nah, too much going on.  Too much to see.  Too much to see.  Too much to see and do.  Right?  I've got to be faithful after you see the whole country.  Not after you just see Cleveland.  Right.  If you're just looking at Cleveland, you mean you should see the world a little bit.  See the world first and then you could decide what city you want to settle into. 
[01:17:30]  Right?  That's a great logic for 17.  Sure.  You never even thought about being faithful at 17.  You should be looking into a different one every night.  Oh, yeah.  Hello!  You should be getting frequent flyer miles at 17.  You should visit a couple cities in the same day.  Oh, man.  In this day and age, you can do that.  Yeah.  Got some good flights.  All right.  Here's another confession coming in. 
[01:18:00]  How did this happen?  Hold on one second.  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, we are now on final approach to the city of Abigail.  Uh, fasten your seatbelts.  It's going to be a bumpy ride in.  Surprisingly, that's causing a lot of turbulence.  John, what's going on?  Hey, Wayne.  How you doing today?  Nice landing strip bet.  All right.  I love this approach.  You got a pretty runway. 
[01:18:30]  All right, man.  What's up, John?  Oh, hey.  Are we making confessions today, then?  Yeah.  I don't know how we stumbled into this, but sure.  Yeah.  I've got a pretty dirty confession.  I'll keep it clean, but it's dirty.  All right.  The neighbor's got a nice 17-year-old daughter that I shot from our window to her shower,  her bathroom.  Nice.  And I like to spank a match every morning when I wake up and go to work.  She's there in the shower, nice and clean.  That's good.  So you look at your neighbor showering every morning. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  It's the neighbor's daughter.  Wow.  That rocks.  You know what you do when you're watching her shower and you're spanking out?  You turn on Patty Steele.  You've got a great voice.  And then you get the audio and the visual.  Not a bad idea.  Well, I like to watch the A-team and spank a patch.  God, how cool is that, though?  How old is she?  I don't know.  I think she's 17.  She's a Catholic girl. 
[01:19:30]  You see her naked every morning.  Every morning.  Wow.  Yeah.  I hope they're not listening.  I know.  I was thinking that.  I'm like, you're nuts for admitting that.  Yeah, really?  You've got to change your voice if you're going to admit something like that.  I tried that, but there's nothing here to make me change my voice at all.  All right, John.  All right, thanks.  Very good.  You guys suck.  All right.  Let's go to Joe.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Joe?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I have, like, crazy sex fantasies about my first cousin. 
[01:20:00]  And, like, I just picture her, like, naked, but just her socks on.  You know?  How old are you?  It's like, she's banging, oh, man.  She is hot.  Joe?  What?  How old are you?  How old am I?  Yeah.  23.  Oh, I am?  I'm younger.  Thank you.  And you know how old I am?  I'm 28.  She's 23.  And she is just banging, you know?  It's great.  And she has her socks on? 
[01:20:30]  Oh, yeah.  Her socks are the cutest little ankle socks, you know?  Oh, the little ankle socks?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, those are pretty good.  She's got a little piece of the bone sticking out, you know?  All right.  All right, fellas.  Thank you.  Because she's got real ugly feet.  Let's go with the real confessions, please.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I had the choir to confess on, like, one day I was invited to cook for these girls from Finland.  And they're all, like, members of the PETA.  Right.  But they had, like, 50 cats. 
[01:21:00]  So I went over and got some of the nine lines of cat food and put it into their spaghetti sauce.  Oh, my God.  You serve cat food to PETA people?  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Oh, by the way, one thing.  I hope you enjoy the hammer.  What hammer?  The hammer that I made for you guys, the ones you always smash in CDs with.  Oh, yeah.  We love that one.  Oh, that's a favorite around here.  That was you?  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Actually, that's a baby one, but I made one, like, triple the size of that.  Very cool.  You can't even lift it.  Thanks, Chris.  All right.  No problem, man.  Bye.  Later.  And, of course, Opie, that one belongs to Gallagher. 
[01:21:30]  He smashes watermelons.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  No, I was to the call up before.  A guy talking about having sex with his girlfriend's friends.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mine is with my wife's best friend.  I've known her.  She's known her for about 15 years.  My wife calls to bed every night about 8, 9 o'clock.  This girl calls every Thursday at 9 o'clock in the last six months, and we have phone sex.  And my wife doesn't know.  My wife doesn't know.  This is one of her best friends. 
[01:22:00]  Because they know.  They know there's no temptation there, anything outside the phone sex.  So, I mean, if you try it, it works.  Trust me.  Wait.  And your wife knows?  No, she doesn't know.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  She might.  I mean, she doesn't come out of the room.  It's always in the living room.  So, what happens?  Same time.  So, your wife goes to bed at 8 or 9.  Right.  After watching what?  I just want to get the visual in my head.  You're on the couch watching TV.  What are you watching?  You know, Thursday nights, whatever.  I mean, if it's not 4-0, it's just hanging out.  It's my alone time. 
[01:22:30]  The kids are in bed.  Maybe a little survivor or something, okay?  Right, exactly.  And she goes up to bed, and then her friend calls you, or you call her?  No, she calls me.  And then you call up, and she asks for my wife.  And I tell her, like, every Thursday night, she's sleeping already, and that's where she starts.  So, what are you watching?  What are you doing tonight?  And it's every Thursday night between 9.30 and 10 o'clock.  And is this lady married?  No, she isn't.  She's single.  Now, do you see her at all?  Yeah, we hang out, like, every Saturday night.  Oh, my God.  You know, she's my wife's best friend, but there's never anything talked about except on the phone. 
[01:23:00]  Anything else, it's just, we both act so natural.  So, when she's over, and your wife's there, too, do you at least kind of give that nod, a little acknowledgement, like, hey, you know?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Right, we give each other a little love.  Oh, no.  It's wild, man.  How long has this been going on?  About six months now.  You guys are going to have sex.  You guys are going to have sex eventually.  You know what it is?  It's a lot better with, you know, not knowing what it's like, but when I do see her on Saturday nights, I know Thursday nights I'm having sex with her. 
[01:23:30]  I'm having sex with her.  Aren't you, are you loud at all?  Or, I mean, you don't make any noise that your wife kind of knows what you're doing out there?  And how long does this take?  No, I guess not.  Unless my wife knows, maybe her friend told her, and she's cool about it.  You know, like I said, every Thursday night between 9.30 and 10, it's the same thing.  Nice half-hour session.  Yeah, exactly.  With your wife's best friend on the phone.  And it's even better.  It's her phone bill.  She goes with me.  And then what do you just sit there and go, okay, right now I'm spanking it, or you just describe what you're doing? 
[01:24:00]  We just get into it.  We just get into it, but, you know, what we're both wearing.  Well, she'll get into what she's done with a guy like she met, like, the week before.  Right.  And she'll get into, like, what she did with him for, like, graphic detail.  I mean, word for word.  Right.  I mean, she gets loud, but she lives by herself.  And the whole time, you're just, like, cranking it, and she's telling you what she did.  Right.  Or there'll be some times where, you know, actually, you know, I just sit there and I, uh-huh, and I'm actually still watching TV. 
[01:24:30]  But, like I tell you, seriously, you try it, you know, the friends, they want to know what it's like to be with you.  So, I don't know.  It's six months.  And does she complete on the other end?  No, she definitely complete.  And she's screaming like an animal?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, big time.  You don't have an extension in the bedroom, do you?  Yeah, I do.  Oh, you're insane.  Yeah, but that's the fun part of it, you know, the part of my getting caught. 
[01:25:00]  And if I do get caught, I say we were joking around.  Mm.  You know, but this is, like I said, her best friend.  Not even one that the guy before was saying, ah, maybe one that she doesn't trust.  Those are the ones they watch out for.  This is her best friend.  She's known for 15 years.  That's wild.  She's our maid of honor.  That's a great confession, Eric.  Thank you.  Yeah, you got it, man.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  Wow, that is a good one.  Damn.  Kind of tricky, though, with the extension in the bedroom.  If that wife just picks up the phone while she's completing and he's like, oh, blah. 
[01:25:30]  What the hell?  Who's that?  Oh, nothing.  I'm changing my billing address on my Amex card.  Anthony.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Love your show.  Thank you.  I have this one on my chest since I was 13.  I used to live on the top floor.  Instead of this girl, she was 13 also.  I used to go on the roof at night and used to look in people's windows like a stupid  peeping Tom.  Yeah.  Watch her mom read books in the nude, have her daughter shave her legs. 
[01:26:00]  And when she used to have a guy over, I used to stick around because I knew they would  get busy and used to watch that.  So you would go on the roof and watch your friend's mom have sex?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  It was cool.  Of course it was.  It was awesome.  And I happened to see a 65-year-old taint, a pregnant woman's taint.  I mean, you get to see a lot.  It's still pretty damn cool when you're 13.  13 was awesome.  That's all right.  How old are you now?  Me?  33.  33.  And I bet you have all the details still in your head. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, like it was yesterday.  Like it was yesterday.  Hey, real quick.  Yeah.  You owe me a little apology.  What?  I was the one who called in about my dad with the pranks about the morgue with the  bolts in the ear.  Remember?  Yeah.  It was true.  And you didn't thought I was a liar.  All right.  Oh, with the guy that used to, in the morgue, they drain the people by hanging them by the  ears.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But you didn't, you said they hung them by their ears.  It's like some kind of a bolt thing that goes into the skull.  I'm glad I forgot about the bolts.  You would have definitely hung up on me. 
[01:27:00]  Well, it sounded silly when you said they hung corpses by their ears.  I heard the damn thing about six years ago.  Can I tell you?  All right.  Thank you, Angie.  Talk to you later, guys.  All right.  You've got no apology.  Danielle wants in on this one.  Absolutely.  Danielle.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Well, of course you say that I've been sleeping with my boyfriend's best friend.  Ah, who are?  For, you know, we went out, like, this actual Friday.  Me and all my friends and his friend.  So why?  We all hung out, whatever. 
[01:27:30]  So why don't you just break up with your boyfriend and start dating his best friend?  You know, that's really evil.  I don't think there's none more evil.  When you ask how much more evil can that be, the answer is none.  None more evil.  Yeah, right.  But he's also, you know, he's also doing the answer.  All right.  Thank you, Danielle.  All right.  Thanks.  Phone's a little crappy.  It's a healthy little relationship.  Had to move on there.  Yep.  Yep.  Got to take a break.  Is Jeff coming in today? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Jeff from Survivor should be here.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  He was really cool when we talked to him on the phone.  Yeah.  And Kimmy?  Kimmy's stopping by again?  Kimmy says she's stopping by, yeah.  She's like our new pal.  Our new TV pal.  Yeah, I got to ask her about this club she works at.  Let's see what kind of info she'll give me.  Very interesting place, that blue.  Yeah.  In the Garden City Hotel.  Is it like the...  Very happening.  From the brief description I got of some of the stuff that was going on, it sounded like 
[01:28:30]  that little backroom party they had at Bada Bing.  Yeah, but it's in the open, though.  That's the weird part.  Oh, is it?  Oh, yeah.  VIP rooms, like, right in the open.  Any separate rooms to get the Tony Soprano special?  No.  Come here.  And he's pulling up by the head.  Is that the best BJ scene ever?  That was great.  Ever filmed when all you see is Tony's face and the girl's, like, the back of her head  and she's just going off on her. 
[01:29:00]  He's like, I got to take care of this crap.  Pushes her away.  Yeah, yeah, that was a good one.  Yeah, I heard.  But you're saying there's, like, chicks walking around and stuff?  Sorry.  Joey!  Joey, you sure you want to confess this?  Yeah, I'm not pretty sure about this, Ted.  All right, hold on, hold on.  You've got to keep it really, really clean for the radio.  Just make it vague.  Very vague.  I know, fellas. 
[01:29:30]  I know the deal.  I got it.  You really want to confess this?  People might recognize your voice.  I'm not too worried about that.  I'm not concerned with what other people think, you know?  All right.  Joey, what's your confession?  When me and my girlfriend like to have sexual intercourse,  I sometimes let her play around with my a-hole.  So, it's pretty good.  See if they dumped out of that.  They had to.  They had to.  It was too descriptive.  Joey, they might have dumped out.  Yeah.  They might have dumped out on that one?  Yeah.  What you're saying is that when you are having sex, 
[01:30:00]  you sometimes let the girl explore the nether region.  I don't think they dumped out.  Dump?  All right.  What happened?  I was going to say he finally dumped it.  Oh, they did dump it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Basically, Joey wants to say that he lets his girlfriend do stuff with her fingers.  Yeah.  Digitally explore the nether region. 
[01:30:30]  The area that is usually the exit only.  Yeah, but it's enter for me, you know?  But you kind of like that?  Yeah, you know, it gets my rocks off somehow, you know?  It gets me going a little bit.  I'll tell you something, fellas.  It's great for the...  I have to dump out of that.  Your language.  We understand.  Very descriptive.  We understand.  You're really into it, okay?  Can she clap yet?  Oh, my God.  Get the umbrella. 
[01:31:00]  All right, Joey.  All right, now open it.  All right, Joey.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right, bye.  Thank you.  For some reason, a lot of people are calling up with some bizarre...  Howdy!  Saget!  Oh, boy.  All right, man.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  In a few minutes, we should have Jeff from Survivor in studio.  Also, our new friend, Kimmy. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, yeah, we've got to get into this thing, Rick, too.  I'll show you as we go to a break here.  Opie and Anthony present the best in reality programming starting next Monday.

Hey, Fez, I know that you know that the police are called New York's finest.  Did you know that the city sanitation workers are called New York's strongest?  They sure are.  One morning, three of them were filling my can, and I couldn't stop them.  Filling your can?  They're supposed to...  Oh, God, you're talking about your ass, not garbage.  It was awful.  They made a beeping noise when they backed me up.

We have Sam Adams all over the building now.  We love it.  We do love it.  We really do.  Sam Adams Summer Ale is here now, too.  They have a lot of seasonal beers, Sam Adams, and they're great. 
[01:33:00]  We drink it all the time, crisp, refreshing, and it doesn't taste like the regular watered-down American beers usually taste.  It's got a flavor to it.  Jim Cook, one of our favorite guests here.  Heads up.  Sam Adams.  Unbelievable.  And this guy's always tanked on the stuff.  He loves it.  Flows through his veins.  No, we love it, too.  We got it stocked up in the fridge in the back.  And after every show,  Oh, man. 
[01:33:30]  That sounded really good.  You can use one right about now.  An icy cold Sam Adams.  Check out the Summer Ale from Sam Adams.  Yeah, Sam Adams Summer Ale.  Yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  All right.  We'll be back.  Dig the Chick.  The Radio Chick.  Weekdays, 9 to noon.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WNEW. 
[01:34:00]  New York.  A lot of confessions on the phone lines.  7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We've just been informed that Jeff had to cancel.  So we don't want to lead anyone on until we'll just announce that.  Oh, Jeff from Survivor?  Yeah, they might be punishing us for the Jerry incident from last week. 
[01:34:30]  We don't know.  Uh-oh.  We don't know what to believe as far as that goes anymore.  He was scheduled and now he's not.  Has nothing to do with Sarah?  Nah.  Not that one.  Smitty from Hoboken.  I have a confession.  I faked a broken leg for eight weeks.  Cast and all to get an extra two weeks vacation from work.  I told them I was in traction when I was really in Jamaica.  How did he get a cast? 
[01:35:00]  He just put a fake cast on?  Probably, yeah.  Sounds real.  This one's a little twisted.  Crotch sniffer from Beth Page.  Here's my confession and I swear it's true.  At Thanksgiving dinner at my sister-in-law's,  I went into the bathroom hamper and went out of batch  while sniffing my sister-in-law's dirty panties.  Oh, my God.  Toddle from New York. 
[01:35:30]  Trying to be in specials where the chick has the problem.  The sicker the problem, the more the bats.  Now, that's a fun new game.  The after-school special.  Starring Valerie Bertinelli.  Bertinelli.  Meredith Baxter-Bernick.  Yes.  That's a lifetime favorite.  It's about latchkey kids that have to come home  and the single parent is at work. 
[01:36:00]  So they have to heat up their own Campbell's soup.  I'm Sarah and I cut.  I'm a cutter.  I'm a cutter.  Oh, you tell me.  I thought it was drugs and sex.  It turns out she's a cutter.  I didn't know about this.  And then the shrink has to tell the parents,  this is very popular and serious thing that happens these days.  A cutter.  A cutter.  Those were always the best. 
[01:36:30]  The after-school special.  Yeah, you take it.  I'm Beth and I pull out my eyelashes.  Yes.  Because my mommy didn't love me.  It says it's a portrait of a teenage slut.  You take my breath away.  I don't know what to say.  You take my breath away.  That was an after-school special song.  Of course it was.  I remember that.  What was that story about?  Oh.  Take my breath away. 
[01:37:00]  Whew.  Remember the one Eve Plum was in Jambrady?  It was Sarah's portrait of a teenage alcoholic or something.  Nice.  And, yeah.  That wasn't an after-school special,  but it was one of those family movies that you watched with your parents.  And she was just a raging drunk in school with a little vodka bottle.  And it was like, hey, it's John Brady.  I'm drinking with George Clark.  This is great.  I used to love those after-school specials. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Tunnel makes a good point.  The sicker they are.  Oh, yeah.  There was the one about the girl and, God, what was it?  Oh, the father was the kid toucher.  And her father was doing things to her.  And it was Ted Danson, I think.  Yeah, Ted Danson was the father, and he's touching the kid.  That would rot.  And the kid was too scared to tell anyone?  Yeah.  Don't remember the name of that one either.  Then, you know, justice always prevails. 
[01:38:00]  And then there was the one with the, like I was saying,  the guy that played the school admissions guy from Risky Business.  Oh, God, yeah.  Mazur.  Right, right, right, right.  Yeah, and he was the kid toucher,  and it was the little kid from one of the vacation movies.  It was the girl.  Was she retired?  Yeah, and his name was Howard.  Yeah, I was watching.  Yeah.  You saw that one too, Rick.  And he was taking pictures of her on the rock in the park.  And just at first, he was just taking regular pictures. 
[01:38:30]  And he's like, okay, why don't you pull your shirt down a little bit?  And she's like, oh, Howie.  And she just started, he started snapping the picture.  He goes, it's okay.  You're like a supermodel.  You're like Farrah Fawcett.  Just take your shirt down a little bit.  I felt disgusting watching this show.  Okay, and then the mother bursts in his apartment,  and there's like boys on the floor eating pizza,  and the mother starts beating the crap out of him. 
[01:39:00]  It was great.  Richard Mazur was his name.  Richard Mazur.  Yeah.  Sam.  Hello.  Hey, what's going on?  Sam's a girl.  All right.  What's going on?  I'm sorry.  I'm a little sick.  My voice is a little effed up,  so don't make fun of me because I don't smoke.  Before this confession, really quick,  Ted Danson, something about Amelia.  That was Amelia's deep, dark secret, was Ted Danson.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  I'm like 31, and I have a 21-year-old lover,  and two weeks ago I invited him to be intimate with my girlfriend and myself, 
[01:39:30]  my best friend, because she has like 38 triple D breasts,  and I figured he'd never get that encounter ever again in life.  Because we usually meet at her house to, you know, do the deed,  because I'm kind of engaged and he lives with me.  So while we were in the midst of a...  You're engaged and you're having a threesome with a man 10 years younger.  Yeah.  He's my lover.  He's my boyfriend.  Nice.  I know it's sick.  He also, he was... 
[01:40:00]  Well, so what's wrong with that?  Because he's involved with the threesome with your friend, right?  Right.  Well, he was eating my peach,  and I kind of brought it up while he was having some fruit.  Right.  And I asked him, I was like,  hey, would you like to try some melons?  And I said, they're rather big ones.  And they're 38 triple D,  and how often do you guys ever get to, you know, get a hold of those?  Not too often.  38 triple Ds.  There you go.  Right.  So being a good friend that she is,  she came in and, you know,  and I won't even give this treatment to my favorite son. 
[01:40:30]  I think I recognize his voice.  Oh, no.  It's coming from upstairs.  Is this phone coming?  Actually, no, it's not.  I have to get out of my car because the phone,  the stupid transmitters or whatever,  dropped my call,  and I had to run, drive to my house and, like, call back.  All right, Sam.  Thank you.  That's nice.  All right, thanks.  We have a song to play, though.  And this is...  Oh.  This will bring back memories to the older listeners of our show. 
[01:41:00]  After school special music.  Yeah.  Who did this, Rick?  Rex Smith.  Rex Smith.  Remember Rex Smith?  There he goes.  What you say,  you take my breath away.  Every song I say.  Was this the after school special where Helen Hunt got PCP?  Remember that one?  Or is this the Scott Baio after school special, Stone?  Take my breath away. 
[01:41:30]  Check your balls and check it out now.  You smile and it's okay.  Okay.  Take my breath away.  Oh.  What a promise.  Hey, that's it.  On a sizzling summer day.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Hey, boy.  Take my breath away.  Take my breath away. 
[01:42:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  What about our huge big hooters, huh?  I thought I told you to shut up.  Oh, man.  You take my breath away.  So bad.  And I don't know what to say.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Don't just sit.  Roll around like a dog. 
[01:42:30]  Sweet, miserable crap.  Huzzah.  Hey, he keeps licking his finger.  Me.  What the hell were you thinking?  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  I smell the ramen poontane.  Gay.  Totally gay.  Liberace gay.  Gay.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You take my breath away.  I don't know what to say. 
[01:43:00]  You're a kid toucher.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Cause it's taking my breath away.  You're a filthy whore.  Hey.  It's taking my breath away.  This is horrible.  Virgin.  Look what I did to you again. 
[01:43:30]  Your days of finger-banging, old, merry-day butt-stops, through her pretty pig patties, are over.  Nice head, Dick.  Shut up, Demi.  How's that for a chopper?  Shut up! Shut up!  Rex Smith?  Wow.  I know, I think what that after-school special was about was the chick was in love with him, right? 
[01:44:00]  Because he was also in the after-school special, and the chick was, like, in love with this guy.  But I can't remember what happened.  Yeah, but wasn't it McNichols?  Christy McNichol?  Wasn't she in that one?  She might have been.  No, wait, wait.  Someone's got to get the show Family.  Wasn't he in Family?  Someone's got to get us the synopsis of that after-school special where Smith sung that song.  So, I remember it was pretty intense. 
[01:44:30]  Pretty intense.  That was great.  Doug knows what the movie's about.  Let's see.  Doug.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going?  The 13-year-old girl on the show was an actress who was also on that sitcom, Fish.  Fish?  Yeah.  With Abe Vigoda.  Yes, the spin-off.  And she falls for Rex Smith.  He's like a 21, 22-year-old guitar player.  Yeah.  And she says she's like 17, and she even denies being Jewish.  Oh, there's the thought.  Like she drives up to a Catholic school, puts on a Catholic uniform. 
[01:45:00]  Oh, yeah.  I remember that.  And then that's when that song comes on.  So, the big deal was that she was only 13 and not 17, like she told Rex Smith's character?  Yeah, exactly.  And at the end, he blows her off because he knows he can get in trouble.  And at the end, he just goes for it anyway.  You see him making out as the credits are rolling.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Was it called Fallen Angel?  No, Fallen Angel was the one with Richard Mazur.  Right.  And Dana Hill was her name. 
[01:45:30]  She was that, like, fidget kid with bad kidneys or something.  Yeah, it's a real sappy movie.  Very good.  Thank you, Doug.  Sorry, man.  All right.  And, of course, Richard Mazur in Fallen Angel was, like, the soccer coach guy.  It's always the soccer coach.  And they had won a game, and he's like, I'll take you all out for pizza.  He was the definitive kid toucher back then when that movie came out.  It was so bad.  He hooks up with a kid porno ring, and he's making movies.  Mark, what's going on? 
[01:46:00]  Hey, me?  Yeah, you.  Oh, sorry, man.  Up the shelf.  Thanks.  I banged my friend's mom.  You banged your friend's mom.  How old are you?  28.  28?  She's, like, 46.  Is she married?  No.  And you're banging?  I did.  She had a two-family house, and I needed an apartment for a while, so I moved in.  But because we had known each other for so long, you know, we had, like, an adjoining  door, and we just left it open. 
[01:46:30]  One night after too much to drink, I went upstairs, and I banged her.  Wow.  And your friend has no clue?  Not a clue.  How was your friend's mom?  Oh, she's horrible.  She's atrocious.  She looks like, she looks like 100 pounds of feces stuffed in a 50-pound bag.  Really?  Oh, she's disgusting.  Was it hot that you were banging her that one time, though, or what?  No, but...  Wait a minute.  You can't say that.  You can't say that.  She offered you some backdoor action. 
[01:47:00]  Yes.  And you accepted.  Oh, of course.  What a filthy animal.  That's great.  How embarrassed were you the next day when you had to see her?  Oh, man.  Oh.  Oh, God.  I didn't even want to see her again.  But you know what?  A couple weeks later, I got drunk and did it again.  There you have it.  All right, Mark.  I got a quick question for you.  Yeah.  I sent in a tape a long time ago for the most offensive song contest.  Yeah, the second.  If you guys ever get it, it was called I Hate.  I Hate? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  I think we did.  It was, like, really racist.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You didn't like it?  No.  I'm sorry.  It was that bad.  It was too over the top?  No, not that it was over the top.  I think the quality was either bad or something.  We're going to have the most offensive song contest, too, very shortly.  All right.  I'll do something else, then.  All right, Mark.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  We're looking for Rex Smith's, I think it was 1979, Sooner or Later. 
[01:48:00]  Here it is.  1979, right.  The video cover and everything.  Maury Amsterdam was in it.  Who was the chick?  Let's see.  Rex Smith.  Michael Skye.  What's his name in that?  Michael Skye.  Michael Skye.  Members of the Skye Band.  A lot of it.  Dennis Miller was in that?  Come on.  Dennis Miller.  Jesse Walters.  Hmm.  I don't know who the chick was. 
[01:48:30]  Nice.  Hey, Danielle's got a good one.  Danielle.  Yes, hi.  Hi.  You watch these after-school specials?  Of course I do.  And you guys are forgetting the best ones.  Go ahead.  The HBO movie, Calista Farkart, where she's bulimic.  And then she vomits in jars.  And her mother, like, finds out her little secret when she's putting her clothes away one day.  And opens the closet and she sees these jars of vomit.  And then the mother starts vomiting.  Why?  She saved her vomit?  She saved her vomit in jars because her mother was like, 
[01:49:00]  Why are you spending so much time in the bathroom?  So she decided to take jars and vomit in her room.  That's a stretch.  Why doesn't she just vomit into the toilet?  I don't know.  Because her mother became suspicious when she was in the bathroom so much.  And saw the jars of vomit and started vomiting herself.  It's a popular theme, the bulimic.  Whoa.  747 taking off.  I learned something today.  Bulimia is not cool if you do it into a jar.  No.  Then it's disgusting. 
[01:49:30]  Then you've really got a problem.  That's a problem.  Anorexia or bulimia or drugs.  Cutting and sex.  There you go.  Always good themes.  You guys are great.  Thanks so much.  I like to cut.  Thanks, Danielle.  Bye-bye.  You ever see the homo one?  With the football player guy?  And he's in high school.  And he's on the football team.  And he's gay.  He's gay.  And I think Scott Baio was his best friend.  And he finally comes out and tells Scott Baio in the whole rest of the movie  is how Scott Baio is going to deal with his best friend being gay. 
[01:50:00]  And all the other people are like, he's faggy, faggy.  Scott Baio has to, like, deal with his friend being gay on the football team.  Well, that wasn't a Charles in Charge, Rick.  It was a movie.  It was like an after-school thing.  It might even just be called My Friend's Gay or something.  They really didn't come up with many creative titles.  They had to grab you right in with those after-school specials.  But, you know, something like Susie Pukes.  It would be like they really got to hit the point. 
[01:50:30]  Bobby's a kid touch-up.  I'm watching.  Was he a wide receiver on the football team?  I think he was.  Whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony!  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Quick one before I tell my confession.  Yeah.  Remember the HBO one with Ben Affleck playing the steroid guy?  Steroid guy, no.  Oh, yeah.  I think I remember that one, too.  The last part of those shows is at the end.  Hi, I'm Ronnie, whatever.  I'm the real guy.  Yeah, yeah, I think we do that.  This almost killed me.  He had to skull it by that time because all his hair fell out. 
[01:51:00]  Skull it.  Would be the mullet that a bald guy wears.  Yeah, the superstar Billy Graham 70s, dude.  All right, quick confession.  Yeah, guys.  Drove all the way from Brooklyn to, like, exit 63 on the LIE in Long Island.  You know that's a hike, bro.  That's way out there.  Just for a Hummer.  Just for a Hummer.  Nice.  And it wasn't that good, though.  Still good.  Well, the chick, she used her teeth, bro.  Well, how did you meet this girl?  Um, it was a friend of a friend. 
[01:51:30]  So, Ray.  Yeah, screw it.  It was my ex-girlfriend's mother.  Oh.  All right, Tony.  Later, fellas.  Bye.  Here it is.  The truth about Alex was the one about the gay guy.  It was Alex.  I don't believe people actually come up with the names of these things.  Hey, what?  What up?  Yo, what up?  What up, Lo?  Yo, LL, man.  Yo, what's going on?  Yo, I just called K-Rock, right?  Yeah.  And, you know, I don't listen to rock music because, you know, I'm black as can be.  But, um, they say, yo, we want your black ass call here.  I called my peeps. 
[01:52:00]  I know there's some people protesting already, but we're going out tomorrow to K-Rock.  Me and about 12, 13 of my homies, we're going to protest for O&A.  All right, Lo.  You know what I'm saying, yo?  Or LL.  What?  Oh, Lo.  Now, I'm Lo.  Lo, Lo?  What's your name?  Huh?  What's your name?  What's up?  What's your name?  What's your name?  What's your name?  What's your name?  Yo, yo, yo.  So, oh, yo, oh.  Yes, yo.  What you thought about?  My girl?  My wife?  That's a dick.  The Best Little Girl in the World with Jennifer Jason Leigh is the best anorexia teen film.  You're going to have to rent that one. 
[01:52:30]  The Best Little Girl in the World.  Jennifer Jason Leigh, is she naked in this movie, bro?  I'm sure.  I don't think the girl's made a movie where she doesn't show her, uh, saggies.  She's got the worst, too.  K!  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Did you guys ever see the, uh, the one, Welcome Home, Jelly Bean?  I remember the title.  I remember the title.  Welcome Home, Jelly Bean.  And the little girl was like, Welcome Home, Jelly Bean!  Yeah, we forgot the retard theme, too. 
[01:53:00]  That's always a good after-school special theme.  Like Normal People was the Sean Cassidy one.  Yeah, it was like King King in the early age.  Raja!  We're in love.  Take a good man, man.  I figured I had you to get a kick out of that one.  Cool, Keith.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Mike, do you remember that one?  You don't remember this one, do you?  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Uh, you ever see the after-school special? 
[01:53:30]  Uh, it's about this drunk Boston mother.  It's called, uh, Three Rights Make a Left.  It's pretty good.  Wasn't that also titled, I Want to Go Home?  In the parentheses?  Exactly, exactly.  Three Rights Make a Left.  I Want to Go Home.  Something about boxed wine or something, too, is, uh, in that one.  A simple box of wine.  You're good, Mike.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right.  I also had to, you know something? 
[01:54:00]  Why does he have to do that?  I just remembered, uh, being up in Boston for Christmas.  I used to have to go up.  And for some reason, I was always in charge of taking the goddamn lights off the tree.  I, I'd have to take the lights off the tree and, uh, wind them up.  And the way she had them, one year, she tied them in knots around the branches.  And I don't want to, I don't even want to be in there.  And she's like, could you take the lights off the tree and first get me a wine.  Here we go.  And then take the lights off the tree and wind them up nice. 
[01:54:30]  And then could you please put the storm windows in the screen dyes.  It's, it's, it's December already.  Right.  And she couldn't find anyone else to do this until I came up for my vacation.  Go downstairs beside the furnace, out of storm windows, and put them in.  I'm like, what could this take?  The whole frame had to come out.  Like, I'm using my Makita.  I'm using tools that were in my truck that I needed for construction.  But I'm on vacation. 
[01:55:00]  Could you just put the storm windows in?  And you know, it's awful cold downstairs in the TV room.  I could use another piece of ductwork to take some heat.  I'm on vacation, lady.  Maybe if you didn't booze it up, you wouldn't be cold.  Try some blood.  The alcohol stream.  Wow.  And I swear, dude, I'm on a ladder on my Christmas vacation installing ductwork in our basement.  What's wrong with that, Anthony?  Well, when you're done, put in the garage door opener. 
[01:55:30]  First drive to see us because if we drive, it's going to take forever.  Because three rides make a lap.  I want to go home.  Could you please?  In a touching story of a drunken mother-in-law and a son-in-law in hell, it's three rides make a left.  I want to go home on HBO. 
[01:56:00]  Hi.  What you've watched is the dramatization of my life.  I'm the real Judy.  I want to go home.  You know, today I shared a lot about boxed wine and putting my son-in-law through hell.  And you take my breath away.  But this is also educational.  So for all you abused son-in-laws out there, run for your goddamn life. 
[01:56:30]  Whatever it costs.  I want to go home.  Did I have to tell you about the time I pulled up to my apartment?  I was hammered.  And you know the stairs that go up to my apartment on the right side of the building?  I accidentally took the stairs on the left side of the building.  There was a big party going on for the teenage girl that lived next door.  So there's all teens partying and having a kegger.  I walked up the stairs and passed out on the couch. 
[01:57:00]  Much to the dismay of the teens that were pattying in this apartment.  She had to call her father and say,  Who's the drunk brat on the couch?  You've got to be lying.  Swear to God.  I passed out on the neighbor's couch.  Imagine you're partying with your friends.  And this old woman comes up hammered and falls asleep on the couch.  Yeah. 
[01:57:30]  I want to go home.  You've watched the dramatization called Three Rights Make a Left.  I want to go home.  Hi, I'm the real Judy.  Stay tuned for the next week's After School Special, the longest of us ever.  Hi, I'm the real Anthony.  I was the son-in-law. 
[01:58:00]  You've seen my breath.  Could you just build a car house?  Because I want you to.  And there'll be a week of annoying silence if you don't.  It's January 1st, and I want to go to Samuel Hall.  See, I know the wind whips through it like the ostrich, but I want to go.  And then when we get there, after a few grommetiers, I'm going to say, I want to go home. 
[01:58:30]  And you know what?  You'll pack me up and take me home.  Or else your wife will yell at you.  I want to go home.  And you're off the school special.  On ABC.  Oh, I'm home?  Part two of I'm home?  I want to go out.  Let's go to Tony on the phone. 
[01:59:00]  Tony.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, man?  Just tuning in over to K-Rock.  They're trying to get you guys back by playing a Buckcherry Rock Block.  Wow, that's great programming.  That's going to hurt us.  I love this stuff, by the way.  You guys give good insight to this radio business crap.  I didn't say it's a bunch of crap.  You're right.  It's disgusting.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Have a good day.  All right.  Yeah, that's the way to get us back.  Play a couple of Buckcherry tunes.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh, that'll leave a bruise.  Ouch.  Brilliant programming. 
[01:59:30]  Guy makes a bloody fortune to come up with brilliant comebacks like that.  Yeah.  Play a Rock Block and get us back.  I'm going to play a Rock Block.  You better watch out.  I'm going to attack you with a Rock Block.  That's hysterical.  I'm going to watch out.  I'm going to do a retro Rock Block.  That'll show them.  You've got to be kidding me.  Sticks and stones.  I break my bones. 
[02:00:00]  But I've got a Rock Block.  A Rock Block.  Don't forget those phone numbers for tomorrow because the business office is closed for the day.  K-Rock's direct programming line, 212-314-9285, Anthony.  Yes.  Also, what was that other number?  212-314-9230.  And if you want to talk to the big boss over there, 212-314-9231.  Oh, yeah.  They're going to attack us with a Rock Block. 
[02:00:30]  With a Rock Block.  Oh.  I defy anybody to remember this episode of Mannix.  Do you remember the show Mannix?  He was a private dick.  Vague Mannix.  Started out, he's running across the bridge for some reason.  Yeah, it was one of those Quinn Martin productions.  And, um...  Remember, my brother got his name.  I know, Quinn.  Yeah, okay.  Why not Martin?  Well, Martin was too...  No offense to all those guys out there called Martin, but a little on the face.  Martin! 
[02:01:00]  What's up, Martin?  But this episode of Mannix had the girl that was Lucy's voice on Charlie Brown for a while.  Remember her?  She talked like a snotty girl.  She was on every show.  I think she was Felix Unger's daughter on a couple of episodes of The Odd Couple.  She was on drugs.  And this was back, like, 70s.  This groundbreaking TV show.  And she's up on this balcony saying,  I'll fly away!  I'll fly away! 
[02:01:30]  And she jumped off the balcony.  It was a great piece of television.  I love when the druggies would jump or do something silly.  They called it Angel Dust, Anthony.  The Angel Dust.  Angel Dust.  That was laced in the pot back in the 70s, early 70s.  And Dragnet was great for that, too.  Dragnet.  The original one, the series, not the TV, not the movie.  When it was like, sure, you're on uppers, downers.  Benny's, Dexy's, meth.  But someday you gotta come down to earth.  And life isn't too pretty looking through the bottom of a shot glass, is it? 
[02:02:00]  Like, what?  I'm a tree!  Remember that guy?  I'm a tree!  I'm a tree!  Or blue guy.  Remember the blue guy painting himself blue?  Yeah.  They found him dead in the corner.  Or the chick that was smoking pot and drowned her baby in the tub?  Another joint, another dead baby.  Dave.  I would know he's taken to the umpteenth level.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  Hey, do you remember that after-school special where the guy always peed his bed and the mom  left the sheets out?  Oh, that was the Michael Landon story. 
[02:02:30]  Very good!  The Michael Landon story.  He was a track star and he peed himself.  That's a true story.  That's what happened to Michael Landon when he was growing up.  He was a track star.  He peed his bed and his mom used to hang the-  Sheets out.  The urine-stained sheets out the window for the whole neighborhood to see.  Oh.  Bedwetter.  Bedwetter.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Dave.  I guess we've got to take a little breaks.  Breaks?  Yeah.  A break. 
[02:03:00]  I put on the breaks.  A break snowboard.  A break.  Jay Moore on the hotline.  We've got to talk to him about his guest hosting on Regis.  That's right.  I think Thursday.  Don't do too good a job.  Tell him to either call us back or we'll call him.  Because we've got to do a commercial and we'll talk to Jay next.  Okay?  Oh, now they're getting us back by having Buck Cherry themselves on the radio.  Ooh.  All right.  Good programming by the Abercrombie and Fitch Midget. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, Jay.  Yeah, I think this is an equal fight.  You got us.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I mean, you're never going to amount to anything.  It's awful.  It's awful.  Very, very offensive.  This photo is great for the airwaves.  I cannot believe that those morons are on the air.  I don't know, Anthony.  I think this is better than a rock block, don't you?  Only half is nauseating.  Well, this is a coincidence, but I can use one, really. 
[02:04:00]  We got any of the Java Delos?  Yeah.  We drink this stuff like it's going out of style.  We're talking about Planet Java, Anthony.  Yeah, Planet Java.  The wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  Planet Java.  It ain't no social drink.  It's iced coffee that lets you be yourself.  Keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling trucks.  They hit the streets.  They're coming to an area near you.  Can I back up?  Yes.  Maybe help the fine folks at Planet Java.  Sure.  Planet Java.  It ain't no social drink.  It's iced coffee that lets you be yourself.  Yeah, what's that? 
[02:04:30]  A little weird.  Yeah, lets you be yourself.  It just tastes really good.  Yeah.  It tastes better than Starbucks.  Tastes great.  Tastes great.  Java Delic, which you just ordered.  You're going to tip your bartender?  Yeah.  Give them a tip.  Like, if you're not drinking Planet Java, you can't be yourself.  A little strange.  Yeah.  Just a really good drink.  Should we cross that line off on the copy?  I think so.  Yeah, okay.  I don't think they would mind at Planet Java.  Right.  If you're at home, take out your Planet Java copy right now and cross it off. 
[02:05:00]  There we go.  Cross it off.  Just playing along at home.  The packaging's cool.  Stands out when you're, you know, looking for the stuff.  Oh, you see it in the stores.  Right.  Yeah, they got three flavors, Anthony.  I'm doing up the job at Delic.  Right there.  There it is.  Crack one open.  I'm staying away from the tremble.  You got to drink the tremble before noon.  Unless you want to stay up all night.  I learned that about tremble.  Yeah, you know what you do?  You get the cup of coffee that we usually get before the show.  Then you pop two Excedrin with caffeine in that. 
[02:05:30]  And then you drink a tremble.  And you could actually watch as your head explodes.  It's amazing.  The top of your head comes clean off.  Do you remember a product?  It was caffeinated water.  Yeah, what was that called?  Whatever.  But remember what we used to do with that?  Which was absolutely insane.  And tremble is even worse than that.  We used to take this caffeinated water.  It was a craze that was going on, I don't know, like three or four years ago.  It had like the caffeine of five cups of coffee or something in a bottle of water. 
[02:06:00]  So we would take this caffeinated water and then we'd make coffee with it.  Make coffee with the caffeinated water.  That was amazing.  We would sit in the studio and just sweat profusely and try to do a radio show.  And just shake.  Oh, my God.  Shake like you're at a detox.  It was insane.  Yeah.  And tremble's got more caffeine than that.  I think so.  It's the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  Yeah, if you're looking for a boost, if you're looking to stay awake, try the tremble.  Yeah.  Highest caffeinated drink in the country, like Ant said, yes. 
[02:06:30]  And tremble does the trick deliciously, as does Karamocha, the other flavor.  And, of course, Jabba Delic, which I hope he is enjoying right now.  The grown-up milkshake.  Can you chill it a little bit?  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Be yourself with Planet Java.  No, we're not saying that anymore.  I know, but now that's at the bottom part of the copy.  I'm going to cross out.  Maybe that's like their slogan, like, you know, Nike, just do it.  Be yourself.  Be yourself with Planet Java.  Iced coffee with an attitude.  It's available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold. 
[02:07:00]  If you were a...  But I feel like being a chicken when I drink it.  Be yourself then.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java, say, hey, get Planet Java.  Just ask him.  He'll do it.  Iced coffee just got cool, and it's called Planet Java.  Opie and Anthony present the best in reality programming, starting next Monday.  The Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  No tribal council.  No drill sergeants.  Just hot bodies and cool whipped cream.  Ladies, all you need to do is show up at WNEW between 3 and 7.  You bring the body, we bring the whipped cream. 
[02:07:30]  The Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Only from Opie and Anthony.  Never the weakest link.  1027.  WNEW.  Yeah, all next week, ladies, you just show up with your hot, hot body.  We'll supply the whipped cream and other things, and...  Yeah.  Gonna mess around with the whipped cream a little bit, take some fine photos,  and put them up on a website for the listeners to gawk at.  And we're gonna have some fine trips to give away.  But ladies are calling, like, when do I show up?  It's simple, like all the other contests we've been doing lately. 
[02:08:00]  Anytime next week between 3 and 7.  Yeah.  Show up to get your pictures done in your whipped cream bikini.  All right?  Right!  Looks like we got under someone's skin today.  Yeah, just a little.  Oopsie.  Oopsie.  Made you react, didn't we?  Totally changed their programming for this day.  That's great.  They're trying to figure out, hmm, what can we do to get under their skin? 
[02:08:30]  Seems like nothing bothers those guys.  I know, we'll try a rock block.  We don't care what you play or don't play.  Don't give a flying F.  All we know is we made you react and we got under your skin.  And people are yelling and screaming and breaking stuff over there.  Ouch.  We win.  You're the weakest link.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Mr. J. Moore.  Ladies and gentlemen, now batting number 37, J. Moore. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, that's good.  That's him.  That's really good.  37.  Hey, the man.  Ricky Henderson.  One day four.  Yankees sucked.  Hey, I don't know what's going on, but I just listened to K-Rock.  They played like 40 minutes of REO Speedwagon.  They were playing Super Tramp.  Yeah, what's up, J?  How are you guys?  They're fighting back by doing rock blocks.  That's cute.  Ouch.  Oh, hold on.  We got something for you.  Hold on.  Here it is.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to Yankee Stadium. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  Poor Bob, though.  That's Bobby Shepard, baby.  Poor Bob, though.  Listen closely.  He's got something going on with his teeth.  His teeth are a little loose.  Listen.  Good evening.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I want to play it again.  Hold on.  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to Yankee Stadium.  Yankee Stadium.  There's something back by the molars.  He's a legend.  No, man.  He's 90 years old.  No, I...  No, that's straight old.  That's what that is.  Just straight old?  If I was a doctor and he came in to me about their voice, I'd say, I think you're suffering 
[02:10:00]  from old.  He's just old.  He's like 90.  Yeah, he's up there.  You know, he did an interview on USA Today.  You know what he said?  His favorite name...  I mean, he was around in the 50s, you know?  Uh-huh.  His favorite name ever to announce.  Ladies and gentlemen, now pitching...  Shigetoshi Hasegawa.  Hasegawa.  That's funny.  Vietnamese North Slope Tripweed. 
[02:10:30]  How are you guys?  Jay, we're doing all right, man.  I can't wait to see you guys.  Can I come in this week?  Of course.  We thought you wouldn't show up until after you do your little guest hosting on Regis  and Kelly.  I'll come in tomorrow.  You're going to come in tomorrow?  Well, that's the only time I can come in before.  Jay, are you going to lose your effing mind on that show?  I'm going to have a blast.  I'm going to make 50 million housewives just nod their head affirmatively.  It seems like it's a formula for disaster with you hosting with Kelly, man.  See, that's what you think.  That's in your mind.  Well, what are you going to do? 
[02:11:00]  I'm going to be a gentleman, man.  I'm going to wear the suit.  Come out.  I'm going to do the show.  I heard Jay is going to, like he did on this program, he's going to let everybody know  the perfect BJ with the twist, with the twisting and about 855.  I'm just going to take down the trousers.  Can you put a map of Hawaii on your lapel?  On my lapel?  On your lapel.  You know, I was thinking Carrot Top's going to be on the show.  Oh, God, you know.  Are you kidding?  We all, you know you hate him too.  No, I don't. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, you're so, Jay, stop.  I swear to God.  Don't call Hollywood on us.  We all hate Carrot Top.  I swear to God, I'm a mother's soul.  I don't hate him.  You like the prop comics, huh?  I like someone who does the job in the room.  What happens with, like, someone...  I like someone that makes a bunch of people laugh at once.  I don't like those, like, I'm too hip for the room people.  But it's too nerve-wracking.  What happens to Carrot Top if he leaves his luggage at home or the...  Oh, my God.  Or the...  He can't do it.  Or the airline, you know, loses it.  That's how it goes, man.  What is he going to do?  Come out and he's going to look all awkward and stuff without a prop? 
[02:12:00]  He's going to have to cancel.  Where's the toilet seat with the handlebars?  That's why you handcuff the briefcase to the wrist.  Jay, when Carrot Top is doing all this stuff on Thursday, when you're guest hosting with  Kelly, I'm going to watch you very closely.  I want to see if you're really laughing or not.  When he come down.  Did they book these things for you or did they book them, like, as if Regis was going to be there?  No, they just set me with a guest.  I love Carrot Top.  Hold on.  Back up.  What?  Are you inviting us to the taping?  Oh!  I'd love for you guys to come down.  Uh-oh. 
[02:12:30]  What do you think?  Would they have us?  Okay, terrific a lot.  Would they have us, you think?  As guests?  No, not guests.  No, just to be in the audience.  Of course.  With the rubes.  With the rubes.  Can we, like, hang out in your green room and stuff?  Yeah.  I need two tickets.  I need two...  I got two friends coming by.  Make it happen.  I'll tell them.  There you go.  We're there.  But then it's early, guys.  I don't care.  That's okay.  Usually we get up early.  It's for some crappy meeting that we're getting screwed for.  This will be fun.  You know what we do?  What?  We all get...  I got to get there, like, at 7.30. 
[02:13:00]  Wow.  You guys show up whenever you get there and just maul Kelly Ripa so I have to do it alone.  Like, just be like, hey, you're Kelly Ripa, right?  Could I have your autograph?  Right in the neck with the pen.  Sorry.  Get in the coffin, ma'am.  Sorry.  Now, what you got to do, you got to tell Kelly to, like, cover up that belly button.  It's getting a little...  I've never seen her.  You've never seen Kelly Ripa?  I've seen her, but, like, when I'm running at the gym or something, so I'm not really paying attention.  She's quite pregnant, and the belly button is sticking out pretty far these days. 
[02:13:30]  She's pregnant?  Very pregnant.  Yeah.  I didn't know that.  You can't stab her if she's pregnant, you guys.  Why would you say something like that?  Yeah, that's not cool.  It looks like she's got a pacifier under her shirt on her belly.  Her belly button.  I just make pretend it's an extra nipple.  Popped out.  Well, you could do that.  I just make pretend it's an extra nipple.  Kelly nipple.  Or I make pretend the turkey's done.  So has Gelman been cool to you and stuff?  I haven't spoke to Gelman.  I talked to Alyssa today.  Who picked you?  Does Regis get to say, I want Jay Moore?  That Jay Moore is very funny.  I love him. 
[02:14:00]  Who wants to be a millionaire?  He's a great dresser.  He won the Golden Hangar.  And are you going to wear a Regis tie?  You know, I might have to wear a little giraffe tie, maybe.  Oh, really?  A nice dark blue tie with, like, giraffes on it.  Mm-hmm.  It'll look cool.  You know, I'll dress to impress.  It won't be like my porno look or my J-Lo look that I bring into the studio with you guys.  Your J-Lo look.  That's what you called it.  I know.  I had Rayman sunglasses, and you're like, Jay's got the J-Lo look on it.  Like J-Lo. 
[02:14:30]  That was funny, though.  Come on.  It was so funny that a month later, boom, I repeated back to you.  We're all on the same team, guys.  I'm telling you, it was funny.  I can't look often, sir.  Jay.  I brought a tape of the show when Dice and Otto, I mean, Dice and George were arguing.  Yeah.  I brought that tape with me to France.  Fake George.  The fake George.  When Dice was talking to you.  I was sitting right next to him.  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Get in the coffin.  No, yeah.  And I brought that tape to France when I was promoting action, and I just played it for 
[02:15:00]  all my friends, and they just sat, like, throwing beer bottles across the hotel room.  I could not believe that that actually happened on the radio.  It was quite funny.  These are L.A. guys that just don't get it.  They don't get you guys.  I mean, they don't get it out here yet.  Yet.  Yet.  You should have heard Dice talking to Burt Ward.  TV's Robin.  Oh, my God.  That was a good one, too.  We're going to have to replay that one.  You got the faggotosis on the weekend.  Answer me.  Yeah.  Hey, you know who the number one guest is on the show I'm hosting on Regis and Kathy Lee Thursday? 
[02:15:30]  Who?  Annabelle, boy.  Stiora.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Oh, I know you thought Annabelle Chung.  That's why I had to drop the last name on you.  You're like, what?  Gangbang at 9 a.m.?  She's going to be on Thursday?  Yeah, it's her and, um...  Caratop.  Yeah.  And you guys are waiting with, uh...  And are you going to give away, like, a, uh, like a trip, too?  I have no idea.  They've been very, uh, relaxed about the whole process.  Who else? 
[02:16:00]  What other guests?  Oh, now I'm forgetting.  Margaret Cho.  No.  Uh-oh.  No joke.  Margaret Cho and Caratop.  We're going to go different ends of the spectrum comedy-wise.  Somebody that moves the room with props and someone that just kind of stands out.  You're going to have to do that, uh, thing where you give away, uh, some money or something,  where some room calls information.  There's a star under your seat.  You win $40.  You win, uh...  You win, uh...  The police are up in mobile.  You can get the Jets class.  Eight ounces.  What you're playing for, uh, a caller on the phone is also playing for a member of our studio audience 
[02:16:30]  who will win Tupperware pots and pans.  It's like, what the hell?  They, they, like, they can't.  You know what?  I've been on the phone three minutes with you guys, and I'm already, like, my day got twice as good.  I just feel better talking to you guys, because you make me laugh.  And, Jay, when you...  Surrounded by morons out here.  When are you, uh, playing Carolines?  This weekend.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  It is this weekend?  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  I think it's all sold out, though, right?  I haven't...  Honestly, I have no idea.  Well, you better call Carolines.  You know why?  Because I just sat back in the cut, and I just came on your show last time and didn't even mention it. 
[02:17:00]  What, are you getting flat rate now, or is it still the door?  Because I'm thinking flat rate.  He doesn't care.  I'm not sure, you know.  No, I care.  But I don't want it to be like, I only come on the show to promote stuff.  Nah, we've gotten past that a long time ago.  Jay, I got you.  Ah, man.  You want to hear the best, Barry Katz?  I love it.  Anybody listening, Barry Katz is a big Jew.  It's a big Jew.  He's a manager of myself and other people.  Frank Caliendo.  Yeah, he's hilarious. 
[02:17:30]  He turned us out to Frank, too.  Isn't he good?  Yeah, we love Frank.  I love the John Madden impression.  Yeah.  His Al Pacino is to die for, man.  Baby Al.  What?  Awesome.  Give us the big Jew story.  What?  Give us the big Jew story.  Oh, he goes, Jay, I got a gig for you.  This was like 10 years ago.  It's in Bangor, Maine.  If you want it, you have to leave now.  It pays $75.  You have to pick up Don Gavin in Springfield, Massachusetts.  There's no hotel. 
[02:18:00]  And you got to come back the next night and drop Gavin off in Buffalo.  Do you want it?  Yeah, I'll take it.  You took it.  Do you want it?  Yeah.  It's canceled.  I got you a gig.  It's $50,000 for one night.  You're going to be the first comedian to ever perform inside of Red China.  You're going to be on the Great Wall of China.  They're going to do a big send-off, the first American ever.  Can you fly a Learjet?  What?  Can you fly a Learjet? 
[02:18:30]  No.  You've never flown an aircraft whatsoever.  No, I have not.  Okay, I'll tell them.  I'll tell them.  You need a Learjet.  So what's it?  What's it you got on there, K-Rock's again?  Yeah, oh yeah.  Virgin.  Well, they're pulling that crap where they block us from getting vans by telling vans management  if you go on their show, we're not going to play your music anymore, which is crap because  they built it.  Because any band worth their weight in salt wouldn't give a crap. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  And the station will play it anyway.  It's a fake threat because they're not going to not play a band that is very popular just  because they appear on another show.  Yeah.  So, but they pulled that and the management goes, okay.  So we didn't have Buck Cherry available for an interview or for a meet and greet at last  night's show, which we promoted.  And it's because scum C-blockers over there at K-Rock play like that behind the scenes.  But we put them all out in the open on this show, Naughton. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, come on, Buck Cherry, Naughton.  I did it last night.  I did Jackie Gleason for a second in my act.  You know, sometimes I do it just to make you laugh, Anthony.  I know.  And it does.  And then I forget you're not in the crowd and I do it anyway.  I laugh every time.  I don't care what the hell you're saying.  If it's Jackie Gleason, I'm laughing.  I know.  And I just do it to make you laugh.  And last night I was at the Laugh Factory and I was doing my sperm count thing.  The first time I ever did it was on your show, by the way, guys.  Yes.  And I said, set him up, Norton.  But I said, I screwed up, Norton.  But I was already screaming as loud as I could. 
[02:20:00]  I was like, set him up, Norton, Norton.  And I just thought, there was no coming back.  They were just staring at me like I had Tourette syndrome.  I don't remember Jackie Gleason on Seinfeld.  Set him up, Norton.  Hey, Jay, Johnny from Queens has something for you.  Johnny!  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  I'm not gay, Johnny.  That's why you're talking.  No, no, no.  No, Jay, you picking up tips from VH1's Behind the Music for your Beyond the Glory?  That's what it's based on.  I saw your Bill Buckman one. 
[02:20:30]  That one was great.  I saw your Bill Buckman one the other night, man.  I like it.  I couldn't even take it seriously because you're going into that, like, tragic voice, you know,  and an innocent comment from a reporter turns into tragic reality.  Jay, you're doing the serious read or what?  It's the same the entire show.  I don't do, because my main thing is I don't want to sound like Jeremy Schaap from ESPN.  Meanwhile, Bill Buckner continues to excel.  Oh, nice.  I'm Jeremy Schaap, ESPN. 
[02:21:00]  They all fight vomit on the microphone.  Wow, that is really good.  Oh, yeah, I'll bring Jeremy Schaap out.  I don't care.  That's good.  All right, Johnny, thanks.  All right, man.  Peace.  Johnny called from Queens to make fun of Jay Moore.  What he didn't know is Jay Moore doesn't care.  We're in cleaning.  Jeremy Schaap, ESPN.  I have diarrhea and AIDS. 
[02:21:30]  My full-blown AIDS makes my skin purple, and I clap my pants.  Wow.  Oh, that's awful.  Awful.  Awful but true.  Very good.  I interviewed Bobby Knight and couldn't parlay it into anything.  Bobby Knight made fun and f***ed punched me.  Zero.  Jeremy Schaap.  Telemundo.  The whole network does that.  That's the only reason I work at Fox Sports, is no one goes, Fox Sports Regional Report. 
[02:22:00]  The only network with sports on it, where they talk like human beings.  Hey, Jay, a bunch of people are asking what you think about walking in that Fat Boy Slim video.  I have yet to see it.  It's hilarious.  He's a hooker.  Somebody get a tape for me and send it to the show.  He's doing some kind of Matrix thing.  I've got to see it.  Someone's got to get a copy of it and send it to you guys.  Why don't we ask K-Rock if they could play it. 
[02:22:30]  You all right?  A block.  You know what?  You're coming in tomorrow.  Someone will bring in the video for us.  All right.  Any chicks tomorrow?  We'll get some chicks.  It's Whipman Wednesday tomorrow, so.  Oh.  We should get some chicks down here for Mr. Moore.  Sure.  My friend's coming in from L.A., my buddy Walter.  He loves you guys.  He's the one that came to France and he listened to the tape.  He's a black man also.  That's all right.  That's always good for our show.  I know.  And he's funny.  We make this seem tolerant.  Yeah, we love the blackies.  I'm kidding. 
[02:23:00]  You get the credit on Beyond the Glory.  All right.  Did you guys see the Bill Buckner show on Beyond the Glory?  No.  500 more hits than Joe DiMaggio.  More hits than Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Ernie Banks.  More hits than 70% of Hall of Famers.  Wow.  No one will remember any of that.  Two fielding records, one of which still stands and will always be remembered for game six.  Ouch.  And the saddest thing was is there's like a sense of denial to him.  He doesn't realize that.  He honestly, I don't think he realizes.  He thinks that it was not the end of the world. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, it was in Boston.  It was absolutely the apocalypse.  Rain, frogs, dogs and cats living together.  They will not forget that play until they win a World Series.  And they'll never forget it still.  Well, yeah, but it'll be a little easier to take if they finally win.  It's so sad when you realize the stats that guy piled up in his lifetime.  And no one will remember.  Hey, you know, the same with Scott Norwood.  He was a great picker.  Yeah, that was a good one. 
[02:24:00]  And that was no game.  That was like 40.  But you know what?  He was a great kicker, but no one will ever remember that either.  We boned Marv Levy so good.  There you have it.  But Marv Levy's in the Hall of Fame.  It's Scott Norwood.  It's Scott Norwood's car wash in Cucamonga.  I got nothing today.  I'm sorry.  No, you're fine.  Hey, Jay.  Jay, leave us with some Christopher Walken as we patiently wait for you to co-host Regis and Kelly on Thursday.  I can't wait for Opie and Anthony to be in the green room of Regis and Kathy Kelly. 
[02:24:30]  The two of them.  She's so pregnant.  I saw a foot sticking out.  And I kick him.  My friend Walter is coming tomorrow.  He's a black man.  It's funny what you can do when you put things in your ass.  The only reason I did a Fat Boy Slim video is because they gave me the CD in my ass.  I'm trying to get walking to do a movie I'm doing in May in Arkansas. 
[02:25:00]  Of all places.  That's going to be really nice.  I think I'm going to bring in my sisters just to sleep when I'm so something to do.  Yeah.  Come on, nothing?  That was okay.  I guess we're looking to take a break.  That's all.  Oh, I'm sorry, guys.  That's okay.  I can't wait to see you guys.  I'm going to load it up on the plane tonight so I got complete cannon fodder tomorrow.  Cool.  Tomorrow, you can rest assured, all your listeners, it's going to be a...  Hey, man, it's going to be balls-to-the-wall comedy. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, we're going to rock.  All right.  Thank you, Jay.  Hey, guys.  Thanks a lot.  And I'll make sure you guys are...  If you guys are serious, we'll definitely do the Regis thing together.  I would love to go.  Yeah.  I'm telling you right now, I'd love to go.  Bye.  Oh, that's going to be fun, man.  We'll hang out.  Then I'll feel more confident.  Yeah.  Cool.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  Okay, terrific.  All right, Jay.  See you guys.  Thanks.  Peace.  Opie, any way to pot up the computer quickly for that wonderful play that Buckner will always,  always be remembered for?  All right.  So the winning run is at second base with two out, three and two to Lukey Wilton. 
[02:26:00]  Little roller up along first.  Behind the bag.  It gets to a buzzer.  Here comes Knight and the Mets win it.  Funny always.  Hey!  That's a winner.  I got thought of a kind of brain.  And ashes.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk. 
[02:26:30]  Okay, terrific.  And cut.  Opie, Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  212-757-1027.  It's the O&A show.  Getting under people's skin once again today.  Making people react. 
[02:27:00]  Nice try.  Keep trying.  Go back to the drawing board.  Go back to playing music.  There you go.  We're controlling two stations today, Anthony.  Yeah.  Got them all flustered.  Make them do what we want.  Tackin', tackin', tackin'.  Right up until the king tells you to shut up and play the music again.  Put a set of balls.  That's pretty funny.  We got balls.  We're gonna talk and speak our piece. 
[02:27:30]  And oh, okay, king.  I'll put on another record.  Yeah, I'm gonna be scared of people that let the music do the talking.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not good enough to talk more than two minutes, so I work for this station.  I work for a station that prides itself on the fact that for 92 minutes, you won't hear me.  I'm proud that I got hired here.  Really shows me that my boss has confidence in my speaking ability.  This ain't over, trust me. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  You don't even know what's coming next.  Say what you want.  I keep talking about us.  Yeah, we didn't get to you, right?  You had to talk about us.  Change your whole station around all afternoon long.  You care if you play Buck Cherry?  What does that do?  They're playing it now.  I don't care.  Is that the funniest thing?  Ah, we're playing Buck Cherry now. 
[02:28:30]  I'll show you.  Got your laugh.  Wow.  It played right into our hands.  Who cares?  That is so damn funny.  You want to make a statement?  Don't play the Buck Cherry.  Don't play any music.  Get on and actually speak your piece.  Yeah, if you want to make a statement, blow off the music and just go off on us.  Yeah, it's not a two-minute statement in between songs.  You know why you won't?  Because you can't.  You ain't got no balls.  You can't.  Go ahead.  Stop the music.  And for the next 45 minutes, talk about us.  You can't do it.  That's the difference. 
[02:29:00]  The midget will come in and slap you silly.  Bitch slap you.  Guy's got fake balls.  You don't know what it's like to put your job on the line, you pussies.  Pussies.  Right.  Talk all tough, but you're not changing the programming over there, are you?  Nah, I'm going to interrupt this song so I can speak my mind.  Yeah.  Right.  And I know you're listening to us.  And you know what's pathetic?  This is what's so pathetic about K-Rock today. 
[02:29:30]  They're planning calls.  I know.  We know two of the people that they had on the air today, Scott and Murray.  Ooh, ooh.  Ooh, did I just get you?  Ooh, ooh.  Ooh, ooh.  They're staged calls from their own staff.  Their own staff goes into a room because they're getting so many calls from people telling  them they're a-holes and that they suck, that they've got to get their own staff to call  in.  All right, now call up and say this so I can say this, and then we can get back to music  so Steve doesn't punch me.  Say we're the Buck Cherry Radio Station. 
[02:30:00]  That'll do it.  Hey, Scott.  Hey, Murray.  Hey, they're the Buck Cherry Radio Station.  Damn it!  We wanted to be the Buck Cherry Radio Station.  Damn it!  They got us, Opie!  Hey, what do we do?  It's pretty pathetic when you've got to fake calls.  That's so embarrassing.  Wasn't even believable.  Oh, wait.  I want to sound like a sidekick on the K-Rock Station since we want to be them so bad.  Hey, that's right, Opie. 
[02:30:30]  That's right, Opie.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Hey, why can't I come close to the microphone?  Because you're not good enough yet.  Ha!  Yeah!  Yeah.  Kick-ass!  I'm extreme!  Can I please come to the mic?  My throat's hurting from yelling.  Please?  Ha!  Yeah!  I'm extreme!  Are we in a song yet?  Because I'm ready to pass the mic! 
[02:31:00]  Yeah!  Why can't I have a mic, too?  He has a mic, but he's too busy on the floor on all fours.  Yeah!  Hobbing the knob.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  I hear there's some people around there that like that same friggin' guy that used to bash  the ass he now just laps.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Here's a question for someone that's, uh, I don't even know... 
[02:31:30]  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  That's a question!  Yeah!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Way in the background!  Here's...  Here's the...  Why?  Here's the question.  Here's the question.  You guys fought back.  It sucked.  Didn't even get under our skin.  It sucked.  Just a question.  Do you really want to play?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Cause we're in the sea!  Yeah!  Do you really want to play?  You want to get a little personal?  Want to talk about stuff we know about each other?  Yeah!  Do you?  I love that.  Or once again, are you going to call our boss behind our back and threaten to sue us 
[02:32:00]  because we know things about you?  Do you want to start?  No, seriously.  We're here.  We'll take the street level.  Say, we'll take it to 60 feet underwater.  Now someone's shaking in their boots.  Someone's image would be ruined, wouldn't it?  Wouldn't it?  Just asking the question.  Go ahead.  We'll play.  We're good.  We're good at playing this way. 
[02:32:30]  That's right.  Yeah!  I'm in the bathroom right now.  Why do I have to broadcast from the bathroom?  Yeah!  Extreme!  This is cool!  Yeah!  Are we done?  No.  Yeah!  We'll wait for your answer.  Just let us know.  Answer!  If you want to take it to the street.  Street!  Yeah!  I'm in having mine a bird!  Because when we fight back, there's no rules.  Fight back!  No rules!  Yeah!  STP!  No rules. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah!  Buck Terry!  Yeah!  We can talk about stuff.  What?  I can't hear you.  I'm way over here.  We know things.  Yeah!  Ow!  My throat!  I'm coughing up blood!  We'll wait for the answer.  We'll see if they really want to play.  Ah!  This cute fake playing is fun, but we'll play the real way.  Ow!  That hurts.  I can't do that. 
[02:33:30]  We'll play.  Oh, uh, Dro from Jersey?  No, it's not.  It's not, uh, it's not.  No, no.  It's not the crazy one we're talking about.  Let me see.  That's why this is really good.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, I'll tell you.  Yeah.  Here, hold on.  I'll tell you.  I'm just waiting for an answer.  I'll give them a chance to stop. 
[02:34:00]  You know.  I'll give them one chance.  And one chance only.  I gotta tell Rick, so could you, uh, say we'll be back at?  Hey, we'll be back, man.  Yeah!  Ha, ha, yeah!  Yes, he does.  Are you?  Yes, he does.  I don't know.  Huh? 
[02:34:30]  How do I know?  I've been in radio for a very long time.  People talk.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just waiting.  I'll give them a chance.  He was brave enough to get involved, so we'll wait for an answer.  Are we gonna take it to street level, or are you gonna shut your track?  Street level.  You guys wanna play?  Well, we're waiting.  I do believe there'll be one person, uh, backing out of the battle. 
[02:35:00]  Immediately.  Ah.  That's what we do.  Oh, yeah.  It was just a character.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Totally false.  No truth behind it at all?  No.  I'm gonna be fair.  I'll wait.  I'm just waiting for an answer.  He's a good actor. 
[02:35:30]  I don't know what you're talking about, right?  Just waiting.  What?  Who the what?  Let's see who has the real balls.  Just waiting for an answer. 
[02:36:00]  Just waiting.  This is what we do.  Come on.  It's not like they, uh...  I guess it gets so cold in the wintertime, that there's nothing else to do.  Hey, Ed, open his mouth.  Let's go.  What, are you gonna call our boss again?  To make a stop?  Are you?  Yeah?  God, I can't even talk like that for long. 
[02:36:30]  I swear to God, I'm coughing up phlegm.  That is a talent, I guess.  I don't know.  Who am I?  What?  That's how I drink my water now.  People, people, people who know people.

[02:40:00]  Yes.  Ken Stevens, his mistress is doing an appearance today.  Our GM, Ken Stevens, his mistress?  Yes.  Melissa.  Melissa.  The lovely Melissa.  If you want to see who the GM is banging on the side.  Yeah.  Nice.  Where is the lovely and talented Melissa?  She's at a Schmiernoff Ice Night.  You know, it's not for the money and power, either.  It's for his devilish good looks. 
[02:40:30]  Yes.  That's why Melissa is having an affair with Ken Stevens.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Melissa is at a Schmiernoff Ice Night at the Playwright Pub.  That's 202 West 49th Street, off of Broadway.  Anyway, Schmiernoff and Melissa.  What a combo.  Throw a big rib roast to a bunch of tigers.  That's what it's going to be like.  Why don't we have Melissa on the phone to talk about this? 
[02:41:00]  She dropped in for a couple of seconds here earlier, but we were engrossed.  All right.  The Playwright Pub, 202 West 49th Street, off Broadway.  The lovely and talented Melissa.  Yes.  Yes.  Michael, what's going on?  Hey, I couldn't get through before, but speaking of Schmiernoff, I was in one of those ABC afternoon specials. 
[02:41:30]  No, you were?  I was.  It was in 1979.  It was called The Late Great Me.  And I don't remember who the actress was, but she was big at the time, the girl.  She was a teenager.  She drank.  She was an alcoholic.  I was one of our alcoholic friends.  Do you still act, or how did you get into that?  I'm into music now.  That was one of the last things I did, as far as show business, as far as TV work and stuff like that. 
[02:42:00]  You went out on top.  I went out on top.  Well, we'll have to look for that one.  It's called The Late Great Me.  It was awful.  The Late Great Me.  The Late Great Me.  ABC afternoon special.  All right, cool.  Okay.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, thanks a lot, guys.  Thank you, Michael.  The lovely and talented Melissa on the line.  There she is.  Melissa.  Yes.  You were looking so hot, and you didn't wait for us to talk to you.  Hey, I came in and I came out.  I don't have things to do, you know. 
[02:42:30]  We want to take a peek at that cleavage.  She's busy going.  Sorry, guys.  I had to go off to the playwright's tavern.  Is Ken going to meet you there a little later?  Yeah.  Ken, why would he meet me here?  Oh, good, good.  Nice.  See, you do a good job at that.  You're pretty smart.  Why would Ken meet me here?  I, you know.  Oh, exactly.  Why?  Why?  There's no reason he wouldn't be there, and he's not going to be there.  Matter of fact, why do we ask?  That's a silly thing to say.  Maybe to get drunk with all the other people that are here already. 
[02:43:00]  Oh.  I've come to this bar to promote a product here, and everybody's drunk already.  Yeah, I believe he would go there to make sure the sales, you know, the sales remotes  are working out all right.  Everything's set up just so.  Make sure the client's happy.  Everything is going smoothly here.  Are you guys going to come by after your shift and hang out?  That wouldn't be a bad idea at this point.  You have a drink.  Not a bad idea.  Where are you?  It's a nice little Irish pub.  And how long are you going to be there?  We're going to be here until about 8 o'clock. 
[02:43:30]  Smirnoff Ice Night at the Playwright Pub, 202 West 49th Street, excuse me, off Broadway.  Right?  Yeah.  Come on and hang out.  That's it.  So, Ken will not be joining you?  I don't know.  Maybe he'll show up.  Do you guys know something that I don't?  After the appearance, maybe the nightcap or something?  Well, I do have a date to go on after the appearance.  Oh, yes.  Date, of course.  Date.  Yes.  Whatever.  You guys are after something.  I'm going to figure it out. 
[02:44:00]  Obviously, too late to go back to Philly.  You're going to have to stay in a hotel tonight, right?  Yeah, I actually am staying in a hotel.  Oh.  I need to ask.  Mr. and Mrs. Ken Smith.  Philly, right?  What does Ken have to do with all this?  Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.  Ken finds my paycheck.  Oh, yeah.  I see.  Is that a code word for something?  Hey, it's time for me to sign the paycheck.  You guys.  I thought it was a little strange that, you know, Ken didn't leave for Philly. 
[02:44:30]  He usually leaves for Philly.  I know.  He said he had some business to take care of tonight.  Okay.  I didn't even see Ken today.  Okay.  Has he given you anything for his secretary's week?  Because now it's expanded to just everybody you work with.  Yeah, really.  Has he sent you flowers or anything?  No, I didn't get any flowers from Ken.  Maybe.  I got a little bonus, though.  You got a bonus?  Oh, bonus.  Bonus, right.  No, I'm just kidding. 
[02:45:00]  I didn't get anything.  I haven't even seen Ken.  I was actually away on an island for a few days.  So was Ken.  Wow.  He really was.  He was.  When were you on this little island?  Ken was tan?  He was very tan.  Really?  Very strange, though.  He was only tan on his back.  What is going on with you two?  Nothing.  Just asking questions.  That's all.  Getting to the bottom of things. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah?  Bottom.  Well, even though you're totally torturing me right now, I miss talking to you guys.  Yeah, it has been a while.  Yeah, it's been a while.  Too long.  Well, instead of taking...  Friends couldn't stay apart this long, you know?  Instead of taking those three-hour lunches, you should, you know...  I had a few phone calls from people saying you guys were talking about me a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  You come up every once in a while, sure.  I heard the whole good stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Always.  Always, sure. 
[02:46:00]  Good.  All right.  Well, tell Ken we said hi.  If I weren't with you, Ken, I will tell him he said hi.  Yes.  Run into him.  All right.  All right.  So there's a lot of people down there?  Yeah.  There's a good crowd down here.  We're having a good time.  We're giving away all kinds of stuff.  Hopefully, we'll see you guys down here.  If not, we'll catch you next time.  But we're going to have fun even without you.  All right.  It's Smirnoff Ice Night at the Playwright Pub, 202 West 49th Street, off Broadway.  Yes, that's where we are.  Is Earl there? 
[02:46:30]  He's here.  Oh, very good.  Okay.  All right.  Go down to see Earl.  All right, Melissa.  Thanks a lot, guys.  We'll talk to you later.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  God, it's so obvious.  She pretty much spilt the beans with that call.  It's pretty tough to fake it.  I know.  Oh, Vanessa.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up?  How come you don't give me as much of it as you give Melissa?  Like, I don't understand.  Was she topless?  Melissa, um... 
[02:47:00]  You guys go way back?  Melissa's really hot.  Vanessa's really hot.  What's up, Vanessa?  You're one of the topless bartenders from Friday.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  What's going on?  I'm Dice's friend.  Uh-huh.  Nothing.  I was inviting you guys down for the second time to school.  It's to come see me.  Smoke some cigars.  Have a good time.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  No one showed.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that would be a great place for us, I believe.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I doubt it because I was really insulted.  Last time I'm waiting after you, no one shows. 
[02:47:30]  I thought I had this hot date with Opie.  How cool.  Ah, how cool is that?  It was going to go down.  I dropped a few hints.  You dropped a few hints and I missed them?  You missed them, baby.  Holy S.  Where was I?  I wanted you to lick the Bacardi at my back and it wasn't happening.  Because everyone else licked you.  The jizz trough.  I forgot about that.  They called it.  Yeah.  What's up, Anthony?  Hey.  Well, Vanessa, we'll see you soon, I guess, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Sure.  Bye.  There goes Vanessa.  Oh, she sounded like a big blow-off. 
[02:48:00]  After doing this show for so many years and the type of stuff we see in here, a hint is  pretty much just squatting on your...  How do you know she was throwing a hint?  I know.  What's a hint?  A hint around here.  You better have some V right in your face.  It's like, yeah, do you want a little of that?  It's like, oh, my God, is this a hint?  You know?  That's a hint.  She was completely naked.  Where was the hint part?  Yeah, where's the hint?  Right.  Yeah, with a neon arrow pointing to her V. 
[02:48:30]  Right.  And it's got to be right on your nose.  You make a good point.  What if you mean by this?  Right.  God, you bring up a great point.  What's a hint on this show?  You're naked.  Maybe we should give the girls a code word or something.  A code word?  Yeah.  That's what it'll mean.  All right.  A code word.  Where was the hint?  She was completely naked and every guy in here was licking her.  It seemed like everything that was going on could have now been a hint to everybody in here.  Guys, we're licking booze off of our lower back. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, the jizz trout.  Yeah, but she gave you a hint.  Okay.  All right.  A little slow, I guess.  Jesus.  You leave here with your chin smelling like a trout.  There's a hint.  But not a offering to have you lick booze off her back.  All right.  Let's go to Kevin.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  A lot of play.  What did I learn?  All right.  I learned that three rights make a left. 
[02:49:30]  Yes.  I'm going home.  Don't you forget it.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you.  Christine's got a good one from Freehold.  Today I learned I must watch Regis and Kelly on Thursday so that Thursday afternoon's show makes sense.  Because if we go, we're going to have some stories.  But we will have some stories.  And we've been invited to watch Jay Moore.  Jay Moore.  Co-host the Kelly and, no, the Regis and Kelly show.  Standing in for Regis Philbin.  All right. 
[02:50:00]  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Let me just tell you something.  Your intern, John, balls of steel.  Why?  Hysterical.  His birthday, 21st birthday this past weekend.  Oh, yeah?  We go out to a bar.  The kid does 14 shots or 15 shots, two beers.  By the end of the night, I mean, he couldn't even stand up.  So he goes up to the two hottest girls in the bar, stumbles right over to him.  Hey, do you listen to the little P. Anthony shirt? 
[02:50:30]  That's not easy.  He's using it as a line.  Hooray.  It was hysterical.  When I totally came out to him, it was awesome.  It was great.  It was hysterical.  That is awesome.  Balls of steel the kid's got.  Well, where is John?  Is he still here?  We just sent him out to bring the camera off.  Oh, wait.  I don't want to, like, disrespect you by turning your mic way low.  Yes, Rick?  No, no, no, no, no.  Yeah!  Yeah, Rick?  We just sent him out to bring the camera over to where Melissa is. 
[02:51:00]  That's loud.  It is loud.  We let our people be heard.  Thank you, Rick.  Thank you.  Kofi?  Yeah.  Hi, it's Mike Tyson.  I just want to tell you that the code word, for, like, a hint, if a girl's interested, tell her,  because I do this all the time.  I have a code word.  It's rape.  It's the way she yells, rape, rape.  That's the code word that means she wants it.  Just help it out.  All right.  Thank you. 
[02:51:30]  John, you're using our names to get laid?  What are you talking about?  Mike, say it again.  Mike?  Did we lose Mike?  Maybe he hung up.  This guy, Mike, said he was hanging out with you, 21st birthday.  You had, like, 14 shots, some beers.  And then, when you were all hammered drunk to the point where you couldn't barely stand,  you went up to the two hottest chicks in the bar and said,  Do you listen to me, Andy?  I'm John the intern.  Uh, I, maybe? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Sure.  John.  Yes.  You've got to understand us.  If you admit it, I will respect you so much.  Who cares?  Yeah.  No, I just did.  Like, sure.  It doesn't matter.  You just use it.  I couldn't have been that drunk because there were the two hottest girls in the bar, right?  How do you know?  You were drunk.  Yeah.  You were drunk.  Yeah.  14 shots.  I think, yeah.  I think one of them said something about sort of a kind of brain.  I don't know.  Maybe that was the worst.  14 shots, and then you go up to the hot chicks and say that you're relatively.  You know what you've got to say, though?  You've got to go, I'm psychoma. 
[02:52:30]  I'm a celebrity.  Do you know who I am?  Pretty good.  I need some catchphrases, guys.  All right.  No, you can use it.  I mean, why not?  I'm surprised it took you this long to start using it.  Did it work?  Um, no.  Nah.  Yeah.  Then they were like, yeah, we've heard of them, and why are you falling all over yourself,  and why did you just turn and run to the bathroom really quickly?  So it didn't really work out as well as I would have hoped.  Next time you're in the bar and you're all hammered, go up to the two hottest chicks and  just go, I know Buck Sherry. 
[02:53:00]  Someone got me really good.  Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.  No, go ahead.  I just was checking in with a couple of more catchphrases, like,  hint words that girls sometimes say.  Stop, no, help me God, and okay, but please just don't kill me.  That means they want it.  Thank you, Mike.  He's always checking in with a helpful, handy hand.  Chris from Bridgeport today learned that Anthony thought Cox with Springsteen was cute. 
[02:53:30]  Courtney Cox.  Dancing in the dark.  Shay was adorable.  Shay was adorable.  Let's see.  Yeah, we can start the What Did We Learn program.  It's time.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I learned two things today.  I learned Patty Steele is the hottest voice in the mornings.  And I learned Hope he's thinking about having kids and naming them Jay, Katie, and Will. 
[02:54:00]  Very good.  Very good.  That's it.  Thank you, Jim.  Okay, man.  All right.  I learned Anthony's mother-in-law and Pop-Tart Roger are the same person.  Yeah, the kind of voice is the same, but that was the hell I lived in.  Let's go to Ron.  Ron, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned two things.  One, Jay Moore did a good Bob Shepard impersonation.  Very easy.  And second, I learned about the one you hate about, The Weakest Link. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  And there's only one thing.  I do have an Annie Robinson impersonation of the actual one.  And here it is.  That's the one.  We didn't even hear it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Let me try again.  Let me do it one more time.  I have a key to that.  Well, that's one.  You are The Weakest Link.  Goodbye.  That's the one.  Every radio station playing that clip.  I can't stand her.  I hate that British lady.  You know how difficult it's going to be, you know?  She does something wacky with her mouth when she says The Weakest Link. 
[02:55:00]  And it's distracting, like she had a stroke or something.  The Weakest Link?  And the lip goes flying into one side.  Get in a coffin.  Let's go to Smut.  Smut!  Yeah, what's up?  Actually, it's Jigibaw from Brooklyn.  Hey.  What's going on?  What's going on, man?  I just learned Patty Steele is better than phone sex.  Nice.  And Cowboy Hats are topical.  Very good.

Uh, what did I learn today? 
[02:56:00]  I learned that bulimia isn't cool if you're throwing up into jars.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Uh, today I learned that signing the paycheck is code for banging the boss.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And I also learned that, uh, Opie's ready to take you to street level, yo.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Go Devils.  All right.  Peace.  Yeah, go Devils.  Like to see them win?  Yes.  Might come down.  Tommy, what's going on?  Hey, Opie.  I learned today a smart 17-year-old will not stay faithful. 
[02:56:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  We did learn that today.  Pay attention.  All right.  Thank you, David.  Thank you.  That's good.  Let's go to Hal.  Hal, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Today I learned two things.  One, my boys O and A take no crap from any other radio station.  Right.  Very proud of it.  And two, when the other guy called up and said that he, uh, takes care of himself to  his friend's girlfriend.  Yeah.  Opie comes out with, well, how'd he pull that one off?  And nobody picked up on it.  Hey, it's good to have knowledge. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, hey, baby.  You guys are the best.  I love you.  Don't be a cop.  God bless.  Don't take nothing from nobody, man.  All right.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Let's go to Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Gentlemen, I learned a new one today.  Yeah.  Uh, Ken's going to be going to the Playwrights Tavern because he has to keep his clients happy.  Yeah.  There you go.  Thanks.  Thanks, bud.  Master Blaster run Barter Town.  Uh, let's go to John.  John, what's going on? 
[02:57:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  I learned a Care Rock's phone number is 212-314-9285.  Yeah, we learned that today, didn't we?  Mm-hmm.  And also, we do the same thing in the morning.  We spanked it to Patty Steele.  Oh, we love spanking it to Patty Steele.  She's hot.  She sounds hot.  How's it going, guys?  Thank you.  Yeah, make sure you call those numbers tomorrow.  We ain't letting this one die.  No.  212-314-9230 as well, Ed.  Yes.  And 212-314-9231.  You know, if the girl can't talk, another good way to let you know that it's a hint is mace in the face. 
[02:58:00]  When you feel your eyes burning and snot running down your nose, that means give me some loving Tyson style.  Thanks, Mike.  Sean, what did you learn today?  Hey.  Hey.  I learned Abercrombie & Fitch makes midget sizes and K-Rock's phone number.  Thank you, Sean.  All right.  I'm going to go listen to syndication.  All right.  All right.  I don't know.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  Jason. 
[02:58:30]  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  I learned today that the easiest way to back out of an argument with Opie and Anthony is to immediately try bash and fed thirst.  K-Rock sucks.  Later, guys.  Hey, I thought we wanted to fight.  What happened?  I don't know.  Hmm.  Maybe they finally realized we're all in one big happy family.  Looks like they took my little threat seriously.  Ouch.  I don't blame them.  I hate for that to come out.  Oof. 
[02:59:00]  Oof.  I learned that Napster doesn't block after school special songs.  Lewis from Jersey.  I learned that if you want to hear the best Christopher Walken impression, listen to O&A.  Don from East Meadow.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know what that's about.  Today, I learned 92-minute rock blocks are made so DJs can talk for...  So they can't talk for 92 minutes.  Bleacher Anthony.  You screwed that up on me.  Yeah, I wish we could play the Rex Smith, but we've got to go.  Yeah, we've got to go.  Look at the time.  We've got to go. 
[02:59:30]  I learned there was no Olsen twin reference today.  Yeah, there wasn't.  Well, now there was.  Go ahead.  Joey.  Yeah.  Hey.  All right.  I think that now Opie and Mike Tyson have a lot in common.  Yes.  They both cannot take hints.  Dude, what the hell?  How do you not know?  If a girl is sending you these signals, dude, screw everyone else, man.  Lick her.  It was the same signal she was sending everyone else in this room. 
[03:00:00]  Dude, it doesn't...  See, that's the problem about working on the O&A show.  You get spoiled so easily.  How did you know that...  How was he to know that he was special that day?  Yeah, we...  Listen, Opie's special every day of comedy, okay?  Because Opie's getting, like, all...  It's like this loving from, like, all these hotties, man.  What's going on?  Anthony, man, what's going on with you, huh?  Thank you, Joey.  You're interrupting the Rex song, man.  Yeah.  It's Rex Smith.  After school special singer extraordinaire.  Imagine that.  He starred in it. 
[03:00:30]  And he sings the theme song.  He takes my breath away.  Like water from a one.  On a sizzle and summer day.  Looks like we made it.  Poor man's Barry Manilow.  Was he the host of Solid Gold also?  Yes.  Rick, thank you very much. 
[03:01:00]  A lot of girls tell me I take that breath away, too.  But it's usually from a big body blow to the solar plexus.  Solar plexus.  F-L-P-Y-N.  Solar plexus.  Sorry.  Yes, it is.  You're going to haunt you with my Tyson?  No, I'm not.  That's right.  You got that right.  I spelled it phonetically.  Yes, you did.  Just like old dirty.  Erf.  E-A-R-F.  Very good old.  Thank you.  Mark. 
[03:01:30]  Hey.  I learned that Ken Stevens called his junk his client.  He's so client happy.  Yeah, Mark.  You want to meet the client?  Let's take the client out to dinner.  That's good, man.  Very nice.  Over and out, Desperado.  All right.  Desperado.  You suck.  You know what?  All right.  We have anything to give away?  What do we got?  We got to do a live read.  We'll figure it out. 
[03:02:00]  Opie and Anthony present the best in reality programming starting next Monday.  The Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  No tribal council.  No trail sergeants.  Just hot bodies and cool whipped cream.  Ladies, all you need to do is show up at WNEW between 3 and 7.  You bring the body, we bring the whipped cream.  The Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Only from Opie and Anthony.  Never the weakest link. </pre>
