<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on XM202 began with a deep dive into the controversy surrounding Hot 97's playing of a parody of "We Are the World" that mocked tsunami victims. Opie and Anthony, drawing from their own experiences with similar controversies, dissected the unfolding crisis: the initial offense, the delayed reaction, the escalating media coverage, and the inevitable pressure from advertisers and public outrage.  The hosts played the song in its entirety, highlighting its offensive lyrics, including racial slurs, and discussed the calls for federal fines and the potential firing of the morning crew. They mocked the station's clumsy damage control efforts, including a proposed (and later canceled) publicity stunt involving egg rolls and stockades. The segment also touched on unrelated news: a C-train shutdown due to a homeless person's fire and the existence of "mole people" in NYC's underground tunnels. Opie recounted a trip to a Colorado mud cave with hot springs where he and friends encountered nude hippies.  Throughout this segment, technical difficulties plagued the phone lines.  Producer Ben was frequently referenced, implying his presence in the studio.

Anthony then shared a harrowing tale of getting lost hiking in upstate New York with his girlfriend, encountering treacherous terrain, darkness, rain, and a black bear, eventually finding shelter in a lean-to before being rescued by park rangers and state police. This transitioned into a discussion about Johnny Carson's death and the ensuing tributes.  Opie and Anthony critiqued Jay Leno's tribute as insincere, contrasting it with David Letterman's more heartfelt response. They played audio clips of Leno and Ed McMahon's tributes and discussed various Carson anecdotes, including purportedly fabricated stories about Zsa Zsa Gabor and a cat, and Arnold Palmer's wife and a golf ball.  Bob Kelly called in, sharing an embarrassing story about an awkward encounter with Jerry Seinfeld at the Comedy Cellar involving a dollar bet and a misunderstanding about a table invitation. More audio clips of Carson tributes and related discussions followed.

The next segment began with a discussion of a "Rent-A-Midget" website and audio of a little person's wedding. This led to the playing of a Stephen Lynch song about a "big fat friend" hindering romance, followed by a clip from an unnamed George C. Scott film, where its serious tone was unintentionally made comedic due to dated elements, particularly a scene featuring a violent reaction to a pornographic film involving his daughter.  A caller, David from Texas, recounted a disastrous sexual encounter involving excessive Viagra and a trans person. This fueled further discussion of the George C. Scott film. Another caller, "Reaper," a trucker, suggested a ridiculous "rolling Wow Sticker Stop" promotion. The conversation then shifted to the hosts' desire for Super Bowl tickets from XM and a hypothetical, absurd bet between the mayors of Philadelphia and Boston.  A nervous first-time caller, Craig from Jersey, rambled about *Hardcore* and *Full Metal Jacket*, focusing on their unintended comedic aspects. The hosts criticized his excessive cursing and addressed listener complaints about the show becoming less offensive, clarifying that their goal wasn't constant profanity, but exploring edgy topics.  A significant portion was dedicated to the hostsâ€™ anger and contempt for the Parent Television Council (PTC) and their complaints to the FCC, citing examples of absurd complaints deemed non-objectionable by the FCC.  They played another Stephen Lynch song, this one about a priest and an altar boy, and ended with banter about intern Noah's attire.

The show continued with Opie explaining his habit of wearing the same outfit all week.  The conversation turned to body hair, prompted by producer Danny noticing Noah's chest stubble, leading to humorous discussion about shaving practices.  Studio guest Noah was then questioned about his roommates, lifestyle, and first sexual experience.  The conversation covered his musical tastes and hypothetical celebrity sexual partners (mentioning Ozzy Osbourne and Jude Law).  The hosts and guests shared their own celebrity preferences.  The discussion moved to the Academy Awards, with predictions and humorous commentary.  A caller, Chrissy, a model eliminated from a Sports Illustrated swimsuit show, discussed her physical attributes, cosmetic surgery, body image, and career.  Benji Madden of Good Charlotte briefly called in toward the end of this segment.

Benji Madden of Good Charlotte called in from overseas, promoting his clothing company, MadeClothing.com, and new single, "I Just Want to Live."  The hosts discussed how people react to their public personas. The show concluded with a listener segment where callers shared what they "learned" that day, including humorous and vulgar statements about Opie, Anthony, and Noah.  A caller mentioned Steve-O ignoring Anthony, another joked about Noah's sexual preferences, and a final caller mentioned "a full bowl of Fruit Loops." The show ended with the song "Team America," repeatedly using the phrase "fuck yeah."

[00:03:00]  The OPN Anthony Show, XM202. 
[00:03:30]  The OPN Anthony Show, XM202. 
[00:04:00]  The OPN Anthony Show, XM202.  The OPN Anthony Show, XM202.  The OPN Anthony Show, XM202.  How about if he gives you the old chin tap with his helmet?  That's all right with me.  They are living among us.  Average citizens, average heroes.  Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place.  Controversial talker, XM202.  Controversial talker, XM202.  You better just sit back and watch.  Yeah.  Wait, what?  The OPN Anthony Show.  Oh.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:04:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  How are you?  Here we go again.  How are you?  Good morning.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Look at me with impressions.  Stop it. 
[00:05:00]  Stop whining.  They have their bushes.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's the OPN Anthony program.  Good morning to everybody.  Enough palaver.  We don't have our instant replay still.  No.  Our little sound machines.  Our infernal sound machine.  With my sound machine, I'll rule the world.  But they found the instant replays.  They found them in Tennessee.  In Tennessee. 
[00:05:30]  And they're shipping them back to New York.  Just in time for us to ship them back to Washington.  Because I guess we have rescheduled.  Yeah.  Rescheduled our Washington trip.  I guess we're going to go Monday and Tuesday.  Next week.  Next Monday and Tuesday.  Postpond a week.  One week.  Ben is back in New York City.  Yes, he is.  Doing the herky jerk in the office.  It was good to see him again.  It really was.  I came walking in this morning.  I round the corner.  Looked through our huge glass wall into the office.  And saw Ben's huge head just bobbing up and down in front of his computer screen. 
[00:06:00]  I felt good.  Like, ah, our Ben is back.  Good old Ben.  Yeah.  Ben E.W.  All right.  Well, we got lots to do today, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Plenty of stuff cooking.  I was just telling you that I caught the mouse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And my brother, it was pretty.  Oh, mouse problem.  It was kind of funny.  Notice I said, I corrected myself.  I was ready to say pretty funny.  Well, pretty funny.  I want to lower the expectations here right off the bat. 
[00:06:30]  But, yeah.  There's no humor in this whatsoever.  Let me continue.  I dare you to laugh.  I dare you to laugh at tsunami songs.  Oh.  We'll get into that in a minute or two.  So fired.  So fired.  Should we just jump into that instead of the stupid mouse story?  Because that's the thing.  We like to start the radio show with the big thing that finds our interest, you know?  Well, that is pretty big because we've been through it. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, my God.  We can feel for any radio show that is going to get fired.  You know what, though?  I don't have any sympathy.  Like, I don't care.  I don't care that they played this tsunami song and upset a bunch of people and now the news is picking up on it.  It's not like I'm upset by the tsunami song or anything.  But I don't have any sympathy for other jocks that screw up and are on the verge of being fired.  I almost enjoy it because we've been through it so much. 
[00:07:30]  Misery enjoys company.  We've been through it twice.  And we know all the signs.  And the signs are starting to happen to this morning show here in New York City, Hot 97.  And Anthony and I, our expert opinion as far as getting fired goes, fired, so fired.  Fired, fired, fired.  With a so fired.  Oh, big red capital F fired.  And people don't understand that.  There's fired.  And then there's so fired.  This is completely and totally fired. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, I think so.  It's one of those situations where we've seen it before.  You do something on the air.  It doesn't matter what it is.  You do something on the air.  It's controversial.  It's offensive.  It upsets people.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Now, you're part of the show that did it.  So you're very close to the situation.  So things happen very quickly to you, the crew of the show, and your bosses.  You get together.  You have your little powwows.  And then you go home. 
[00:08:30]  And you sit.  And wait.  And you think to yourself, I think we might skate this.  Because I'm really not hearing anything.  There's no buzz.  But you're so close to it that no one else has really heard about it yet.  So a day or two later, that's when these little signs start popping up.  Newspaper stories.  Press coverage.  Maybe Fox News picks it up.  And that's the phase that they're in right now.  As a DJ, you never want to be at home.  And they're teasing the 10 o'clock news. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Coming up at 10 o'clock, hate radio in New York City.  We'll tell you more.  Stay tuned.  And then weather.  Pretty much at that point, Anthony calls me.  Or I call him like, oh, no.  Uh-oh, strap in.  Dude, are you watching?  Right.  That's me.  Dude, are you watching Channel 5?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  We're screwed.  We're so screwed.  Oh, they picked up on the story.  We're so screwed.  No, I'll stay on the phone.  I'll stay on the phone.  Yeah, let's watch this together.  And then we watch it. 
[00:09:30]  It's gone.  And all you hear during the broadcast is, oh, just us groaning.  That and, where did they find that video clip from?  And that's got to be 15 years old.  That's so old.  I haven't had long hair in a decade.  If I didn't think we were so fired, this would be great.  Right.  But it sucks because we're so fired.  And then you wake up the next day and you go to the corner store to get your newspapers.  And then you see your mug in the newspaper.  Yeah, the story's there.  And then you're like, oh, who else has this story? 
[00:10:00]  And you hope that it's just going to, that'll be it.  They did a thing on the news.  Yeah, we got some press and it goes away the next day.  Sometimes it goes away.  Sometimes it don't go away.  Usually it doesn't go away and it just builds.  This is the snowball effect, we call it.  Yeah.  And, yeah, it builds.  And it builds and it builds.  More people get upset.  And then the worst part is now people that never even heard it are reading the stories 
[00:10:30]  and now they're getting pissed off and writing letters.  And they didn't even hear it.  But they read the accounts, get all pissed off, and you're done, fired, fired, fired.  This particular tsunami song, well, and the outrage, is hitting all the Chinese news organizations around the world.  It's not like there's a lot of Chinese people in the world.  No, not too many.  I hear they're really cutting down on Chinese people.  Yeah.  It's on the front page of Drudge, Drudge Report, which is just everyone goes to Drudge. 
[00:11:00]  I'm sure the trade sites are picking up on it, all the radio trade sites.  And then in the New York newspapers, you know, you turn the page.  Ovi brought up a pretty good point with the newspaper there and the placement in Newsday.  Yeah, you never want to be pretty much the third story, where the first story is, you know, coffins from Iraq.  Well, it's the front page headline on Newsday. 
[00:11:30]  It shows coffins heading back from Iraq.  So now you flip the page.  Which is like, you know, I mean, that's just a horrendous, horrendous, you know, story.  And I'm glad they're finally showing the coffins with the flags draped on them, by the way.  Because, you know, the government likes to hide the fact that actually this is a huge tragedy for a lot of people and families.  They acknowledge that people are dying over there, but they certainly don't want to show it in any way, shape, or form. 
[00:12:00]  No funerals, no coffins coming back, nothing.  Which is just absolutely horrific that they don't allow that.  And then there's the C-train disaster here in New York City.  Somehow a homeless guy got into a switching room and lit a fire and burnt up all these relays and stuff.  And it's an ancient switching room, is what they're saying.  Right.  It's been there forever.  Was a homeless guy living in there?  I don't know.  He went in there probably to get warm, lit a fire. 
[00:12:30]  It got out of control and burnt up the switching room.  Ah, he was living in there because we did a whole thing on the mole people.  Yeah, they find places to live.  There's thousands and thousands of people that live below the streets of New York City.  Whole society.  Thousands.  It's a whole society.  They come up during the day to do, you know, menial tasks and jobs, you know.  Panhandle.  Panhandle.  Get their supplies.  And then at night, there's some manhole covers all over the city where you could sit there and watch the people go back underground.  Mm-hmm.  They go into the subways.  And the reason that the city is leaving these people alone down there, it would just be a major, major headache for the city if they decided to let, you know, to get all these people out from underground because then they would have to find housing or these people would be walking the streets and bothering all the, you know, the suits out there. 
[00:13:00]  So they just let them live.  They just let them live down there.  Yeah.  And they started little fires and stuff.  And in this case...  Some of them have, like, improvised housing down there.  They build these wooden frames, put burlap over them or something.  They're shanties. 
[00:13:30]  And then, yeah, and there's a whole, there's whole towns down there.  There's a whole, there's an old Amtrak track they don't use anymore.  And that's one of the big ones.  I mean, this is a huge tunnel that they just haven't used in many, many years.  And supposedly there's thousands of them down in that area alone.  Some of the smart ones have tapped into electric, so they have power down there.  And it's like, it's like Thunderdome.  Yeah.  Master Blaster runs it down there.  They have a mayor.  I heard they have a mayor.  They have, like, weird officials they elect down there.  Is there some kind of hierarchy?  Yeah, Bob showed me, because we live on 43rd Street, and there's train tracks running by. 
[00:14:00]  And he's like, that's where the mole people come out.  And you can look down and see that there's, like, a little weird area.  As a tear runs down Bob's cheek, because he's upset that they have to live like that.  Poor people have nowhere to go.  Blubbering jackass.  Yeah, but there's areas in New York City that people know that the mole people come out.  And you can watch them come out for the day and then go back down, you know, at night.  So...  And this guy lit a fire, burnt up this relay room.  And you're thinking, all right, they just got to go down there and fix it.  How long could it take?  They're saying three to five years. 
[00:14:30]  Three to five years to get...  Three to five years to fix it, to get the sea line working again.  It's going to be out of commission three to five years.  And that will affect about 110,000 daily passengers.  People a day.  And some guy on...  I was listening to the news on the way and brought up a good point.  He goes, you know, everyone's all up in arms about terrorism.  And some homeless guy shuts down an entire subway line for three to five years.  Where's the security at these switching stations?  Right.  There's...  We have... 
[00:15:00]  There are so many vulnerabilities in this city that they can never, ever put enough security on.  I think it's just a matter of where and when, you know?  Mm-hmm.  When they strike next.  Yeah, I definitely agree with you.  Homeless guy knocks out an entire subway line for three to five years.  And then the third...  I didn't know what I was doing.  I was cold.  My golden buns was cold.  To be Tom, everybody.  I didn't light the fire. 
[00:15:30]  You said I could dance on a stage.  I was dancing on a stage naked and it burst into flames.  I saw the train coming.  You said I could dance on a stage.  What stage, Tiffy?  All right, I'm going to jerk it.  Oh, that was hilarious.  So then the third story, getting back to how this started here, is Hot 97 in Trouble over Tsunami Song, Anthony. 
[00:16:00]  Oof.  And that's what I was trying to say.  You know, you don't want to be, you know, the coffin's coming back from Iraq, sea train, disaster, and then your little morning show is pretty much the next hot story for the day.  Flip over that front page.  There it is.  Call for federal fines.  More apologies after station airs.  We are the world parody.  Federal fines?  For what?  For what?  Offensive to Asians, this song is, obviously.  I understand how they can be upset.  They can even be fired because the station doesn't want an offensive show like that on their airwaves. 
[00:16:30]  But as far as the FCC being involved, this is where people are delusional.  They have no concept of what the FCC is for.  They are not there to remove or find programming that people find offensive because of some political content or some offensive content as far as race goes.  Because they're there to police the airwaves for sexual content. 
[00:17:00]  That's what it says.  It's titillating content.  Double entendre that goes too far as far as weenies go.  That's what they're there for.  People are offended by that programming because they ragged on the tsunami and its victims.  That's not an FCC.  You can't federally fine people for that.  That is a complete freedom of speech issue.  Please, don't say I'm agreeing with these people. 
[00:17:30]  Although...  But you can't fine them for it.  You can't fine them for it!  Despite on-air apologies from the morning team and the station yesterday,  council members and Asian-American leaders called for federal fines.  A stronger apology.  A stronger apology!  How do you...  I really apologize!  I apologized before, but it was kind of like, I'm sorry.  All right.  A little wishy-washy.  I apologize! 
[00:18:00]  They want them to apologize from a gym or something?  With a trainer nearby?  While they're bench-pressing.  Apologize with a cape on.  I apologize with your hands on your hips.  I don't get that.  An apology is an apology.  What's a stronger apology?  A stronger apology equals more insincere apology.  Because it's never sincere.  When you're a radio guy and you have to apologize for something you did, it's never sincere.  Because you actually, when you first did it, you were enjoying what you did. 
[00:18:30]  It was funny.  You found it funny.  Everyone's laughing and laughing.  Do they have the audio of me apologizing after the mayor prank?  Because that's really funny.  Oh, we both were like, yeah.  All right.  Do they have the Boston mayor prank?  We apologize to the mayor and his family.  It was like, oh, do we have to be bothered?  That's exactly my vote.  It was the worst.  A camera is stuck in my face.  You know, the famous mayor's prank that we did in Boston.  And we're walking out of our studio there. 
[00:19:00]  And we're in a building on, like, whatever, I forgot what floor, third, fourth floor.  And the camera crews were right there near the elevators.  They come running from around the corner.  They got cameras in our faces.  Are you going to apologize to the mayor and his family?  So I look into the camera all goofy, looking like I just stepped off a beach from California,  going, I apologize to the mayor and his family.  Yeah, because he said, are you going to apologize to the mayor and his family?  And he went, I apologize to the mayor and his family. 
[00:19:30]  And me, I'm all dopey.  I said something like, well, you know, if the mayor was upset by this,  like I'm putting a condition on my apology.  You know, if he wasn't upset, then screw it.  I'm not going to apologize.  All right.  If he was upset.  And then I have to say, laughing the whole time,  who knew the mayor and his family were fans of the show?  Fans of the show.  Oh, get the bring on the pies, idiots.  Bring on the pies.  That's it. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, and they're backpedaling over there.  All right.  So they're calling for federal fines, a stronger apology, and for the hip-hop station to fire  its morning crew.  There you go.  Calling for the firing.  Well, they actually, their apology wasn't sincere because they came out and they said,  we're 97, we play joke.  See, this is great, man.  The song to the melody of We Are The World was played several times since January 18th  until it was halted Friday amid complaints.  They got away with playing this thing a lot. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, but look who the complaint's from.  One Hung Low.  Can't be real.  John Liu.  Oh, it's John Liu.  Proceeds from the original song, recorded in 1985, were used for famine relief in Africa,  yes, which makes it kind of worse for some people, I guess.  The parody's lyrics make reference to 20-foot waves and contain racial epithets.  In addition to Miss Jones, the other on-air crew includes DJ Envy, Todd Lynn, and Miss Info, 
[00:21:00]  a Korean-American woman who was heard on air registering opposition to the song when it was first aired.  We played that yesterday.  Yes, their little argument on the air.  Miss Info.  Hey, she was smart.  She got out of the whole thing.  You know, I respect her for speaking her mind.  I definitely respect her for speaking her mind.  I mean, the song is hacky.  It's awful, actually.  It's not even funny, really.  And she didn't want any part of it.  I don't know.  My problem with her, although I agree with you, she did speak her mind,  was that it was too, they were so annoyed at her because obviously every time something like this comes up, 
[00:21:30]  she backs out.  Like, if this were the only case where she's like,  nah, this is just not funny, I don't like it.  Perhaps she just wants to keep her job.  Good point.  You know, it's a little rough when you're involved in a show like that  where, you know, you're doing things that could potentially be offensive to people.  And it's rough to be involved in that and not worry about your job all the time.  That's true.  But, on the other hand, then don't be involved with that show, you know,  and find yourself another job on one of those cutesy morning shows where they never get in trouble. 
[00:22:00]  Well, there's a councilman, John Lowe, that's, you know, the leader of this complaint.  Falun Gong?  And he says, did he really say this?  This is utterly irreprehensible.  I know.  It shouldn't be reprehensible.  Just reprehensible.  No ear is needed in front of that.  This is utterly irreprehensible.  That means there's no way it can be reprehensible again. 
[00:22:30]  It's been reprehensible and it cannot happen again.  Because it's irreprehensible.  That's where to blast the stereotypes, stupid.  This will never again be reprehensible.  Never.  It degrades to more than 200,000 victims.  It demeans all of us here in New York City and throughout the world who are engaged in trying to help these victims of the tsunami  and its insult to humankind itself.  These people are so fired.  They caught up with Mr. Lowe riding a bike with a big basket on the front full of wonton soup and fried rice to shove menus under doors. 
[00:23:00]  Those guys are out in full force.  It's a blizzard here in New York City.  Oh, you've got to go.  What a work ethic.  What a work ethic.  Asian guys are still on their bikes attempting to deliver food to us.  Did you see the picture in the, this is even worse, in the Daily News?  It's a picture of how could they make fun of such a tragedy on page five.  It's a picture of Miss Jones with her hands on her hips.  And then the picture behind it is all the washed out tsunami area.  It's a wreckage.  Looks like Hiroshima after the bomb drop.  Right, yeah.  And here she is just standing there with her hands on her hips smiling. 
[00:23:30]  Looking all sassy.  Almost like, look what I did.  Scenes of death and destruction in Banda, whatever, Indonesia are hilarious, right?  Apparently the Hot 97 DJ, Miss Jones, it says are hilarious, right?  Yeah, with the little comma and the question mark.  It's even worded properly.  Oof.  She is irreprehensible.  Totally irreprehensible.  And this Asian guy, John Liu, have you ever heard of him before?  No.  That's why he's a problem.  This is the first time anybody's ever listened to him.  This is the first cause he's ever been able to latch on to. 
[00:24:00]  So now he's really going to push it.  Yeah.  He shan't go away.  Yeah, no, they're in trouble.  So this is cute.  The other thing, because we are experts at this, like Anthony was saying earlier, the  station posted an apology on the station's website.  Oh, yeah.  And they also made the whole morning crew donate a week's salary to the tsunami survivors.  Well, that'll work.  Or the tsunami relief efforts.  Because management's plans to get the show out of trouble always succeeds, doesn't it? 
[00:24:30]  Stop it.  Stop with the, you're grabbing at straws.  You are grabbing at straws.  The best thing management in this situation can do, and we know this, we know this, you  put the show on the air and let them do the show.  Yep.  That's it.  Ride it out because it will go away.  The more you make of it, the more other people make of it.  The more you make of it, the more they pick apart what you're making of it and make it 
[00:25:00]  worse.  Just let your show do the show.  But that never happens, by the way.  It never happens.  Well, did you hear the suggestion management gave?  They said that they wanted to have tsunami victims come and put them in stocks, and then  the tsunami victims would throw egg rolls at their heads.  I heard that they were doing that, and they actually even bought the egg rolls, and now they're  not going to do that, so they have to take it to a children's hospital and hand the egg  rolls out to terminally ill children.  And our old program director, Dave Dickless, wonders why he's not in radio anymore. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Good move, Dave.  Now we've got to bring everyone up to speed, basically, after we did the mayor's prank.  Yeah.  His great idea to get us out of trouble was to put us in stocks in the middle of Boston,  Faneuil Hall there.  Yeah, and have the mayor throw pies at our face.  And have the mayor throw pies at our face in front of, you know, probably thousands of  our insane listeners.  Big press event, and that'll get us out of trouble with the mayor.  Eh, wrong, didn't work.  They canceled that idea because me and Opie got on the air and said, we are not going  to go and do this. 
[00:26:00]  Dave got all mad, and then they figured, they bought the pies already, so they figured another  PR move is to have me and Opie go down to a children's hospital and hand the pies out  to terminally ill kids while a photographer snapped away and put it in the paper.  And when we got there, we felt all bad that they were doing this, and we see the poor little  sick kids walking around, and we didn't want to use them as pawns in our way to get out  trouble, so we just kind of, you know, gave them the pies, told the photographer to get  lost, and left that event, and got fired. 
[00:26:30]  And then we took our beating.  The end of this article says...  Never works, though.  Anything management comes up with does not work.  That's the point, yeah, we're making here.  And then, finally, this quote at the end of the article, which just means they're so fired.  We have to go after the station's advertisers.  Yay, they're...  Good night.  That'll get the fear.  Good night.  Yep.  Yeah, because all your advertisers are going to have sympathy for the fact that you made  fun of the tsunami victims. 
[00:27:00]  Good night.  And that's the reason they're fired, not because of the FCC.  That's a rough one, too, man.  We listened to that yesterday.  It's like, hey, look, I believe...  People say what you want, freedom of speech, but that's a rough one.  So if you're going to go after the tsunami, do it, but you've got to be a little bit subtle  about it.  How many complaints do you think are going into grape soda and Cheetos places?  The KFC is outraged.  Well, here's the song everyone's talking about, Anthony. 
[00:27:30]  We also failed to mention that our old producer is producing this morning's show.  Oh, right.  And we know damn well that he wrote this thing.  We have no...  You know what I'm telling you?  I have no doubt in my mind that Rick wrote most of this song.  I will bank on it.  He's on the lead vocals just singing his little lungs out.  I will bank on Rick penning this one.  I guarantee our old producer wrote this, or most of it.  And I guarantee also he's really pissed off that his name's not being mentioned in all 
[00:28:00]  these articles.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're just saying the crew of the show.  The crew.  So, you know, to be fair, the song just stinks.  It is really bad.  It's not even...  It's just not entertaining at all.  No.  You know, I mean, taking away what they're singing about and all that, there's no real  comedic value to this thing at all.  If you were to write a tsunami song parody, what would you focus on to make it funny?  You know?  The fact that they were saving the white people first. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, stuff like that is good.  The fact that people refused to cancel their vacations and were sunning themselves on the  same beaches that thousands of people lost their lives a week prior.  Uh-huh.  Not bad.  You know, things like that.  I would focus on the child slavery and the fact that people had sticks going through their  heads.  See, now you're perfect for the Hot 97 show.  Do you have a copy of their official apology? 
[00:29:00]  Yes.  Is this the official statement of the morning crew there?  And you know that they sat down with management.  Actually, management just sat down.  The show itself is never involved with the apology statement.  We know this also.  Statements get put out all the time.  We were not involved in one statement that went out.  They keep the show away.  Management and some corporate-level douchebag.  A big PR person writes these things up. 
[00:29:30]  And every word is calculated.  Hot 97 regrets the airing of material that made light of a serious and tragic event.  We apologize to our listeners and anyone who was offended.  Both Hot 97's program director and Miss Jones issued on-air apologies on Monday, stating that  the material was offensive and should not have been aired.  Now, here's the, look what we do, so you can't be that mad at us because we're really good  people line, which they always throw in.  Hot 97 takes pride in its community involvement and in the last few weeks has joined with broadcasters 
[00:30:00]  nationwide to raise money for victims of the tsunami.  Finally, our relief effort will result in a substantial cash donation.  That last sentence is insulting.  People reading this will go, oh, now you're trying to get off the hook by saying a substantial cash.  Substantial in, how are you measuring substantial?  In the money that's been sent over there already?  Billions of dollars from other countries?  Pretty much drop in the bucket, Hot 97. 
[00:30:30]  Nice that you're doing that, but this amounts to taking pies to terminally sick children.  It ain't going to work.  The apologies never work.  You should just not say a word, put the show back on the air, it will die out in a couple  of weeks at most.  But no, they're going to make a stink, the people that want them fired are going to make  a big stink, and management's going to get all shaky about sponsors pulling their ads. 
[00:31:00]  They're fired by Friday.  They're fired by Friday.  I actually have a mathematic formula that I just fill in different names of jocks that  screw up, and you just run the formula.  They're already fired.  They're already fired.  We know.  We've been there too many times.  Are they still on the air?  Here it is.  I think they're on today.  They've got to be still on.  Oh, they'll let them go on a couple of days after, like nothing happened, but in the  long run, here's the song that's, uh, that has created a lot of controversy. 
[00:31:30]  It really is hacky and awful.  Take a listen.  Listen for Rick.  Rick's on lead vocals, our old producer.  He comes kicking in with a big, strong Bruce Springsteen voice.  Singing his lungs out.  There was a time when the sun was shining bright.  So I went down to the beach to catch me a tan.  Then the next thing I knew, oh, wait, 20 feet high. 
[00:32:00]  Came and washed your whole country away.  And all at once, you could hear the screaming chains.  And no one was safe from the wave.  There were Africans drowning.  Little tournaments swept away. 
[00:32:30]  You could hear God laugh and swim.  You bitches swim.  So now you're screwed.  It's the tsunami.  Not as screwed as you guys.  You better run or kiss your ass away.  Go find your mommy.  I just saw a fall by.  A tree went through a head.  And now your children will be sold. 
[00:33:00]  Child slavery.  So now you're screwed.  It's a tsunami.  Not as screwed as you guys.  You better run or kiss your ass away.  Go find your mommy.  I just saw a fall by.  A tree right through her head.  And now your children will be sold.  Child slavery.  So now you're screwed. 
[00:33:30]  So now you're screwed.  It's the tsunami.  It's the end of the day.  You better run or kiss your ass away.  Go find your mommy.  Go find your mommy.  I just saw her float by.  A tree right through her head.  Oops.  And now your children will be sold.  In child slavery.  Oh no.  Please love the kids.  I'll pay for all the kids.  So we're fired.  We don't Asian kids.  The Chinese kids. 
[00:34:00]  We have some fire.  Kids.  The Puerto Rican kids.  I love them more.  I'll pay for everything.  I promise.  I won't touch them.  I bought bubbles.  Come on.  Let's get these kids.  We're on the unemployment line.  Just waiting for our checks.  We love you.  Oh you kids.  We love you.  That is so bad.  The next couple of days temperature is going to stay well above normal after a couple of  days well below normal.  Here's a look at your extended forecast. 
[00:34:30]  For tomorrow, sunshine, 60 degrees, Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  Wow.  A double spot.  Temperatures in the low 60s.  Mostly sunny.  Two for Tuesday.  Two for Tuesday.  Broadcasters.  F'ing up.  Two for Tuesday.  That's right.  Hey, let me back sell that.  You heard screaming chinks and Martin Luther Coon on our two for Tuesday racism.  My CD player was on continue play.  Yes, it was.  But it worked out perfectly.  It was on continue.  Awful. 
[00:35:00]  They are so fired.  When that screaming chink line comes in, it's just, oh, that is the worst.  Yeah.  Oh, you, oof.  A couple lines you could have just fixed and made it like offensive, but not where they  could grab on anything.  Yeah.  No, it's just, yeah.  Brian from Jersey.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, LNA.  What's going on?  Hey, Sugar Titch.  Although they never used gook, which was kind of enough.  You guys there?  Yeah, go ahead. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, what's going on?  I got my virus back.  Listen, I'm watching the news this morning, getting ready for work.  Channel 11 actually playing the song.  These guys are so screwed.  Oh, no.  They're so fired.  They played part of the song?  It was the part they actually screamed.  They played on Channel 11's news this morning.  Did they play Screaming Chink or Chinaman?  Sorry, guys.  I can't hear you too good.  All right.  Bye, Brian.  Damn it.  The last thing before we move on.  Somehow, we'll be mentioned in this. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, guaranteed.  Because every time a DJ messes up these days, they have to bring up all the other DJs that  messed up.  Yep.  And guess who's at the top of the list, everybody?  Number one with a bullet.  Is the phone screwed up where they won't hear me?  Is that what it is?  Because we better take care of that.  No.  Because that guy couldn't hear me.  He couldn't hear you at all?  I think not.  Let's take another call in six.  All right.  Max.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Max.  Max, can you hear me?  Hey, Max, can you hear me? 
[00:36:30]  I can hear you barely.  Oh, barely.  See, there's a little problem with my volume.  Hey, Max.  What's up, guys?  I've got a question for you.  Here in two years, will we be able to subscribe to their program on XM Radio?  No.  The only reason.  Hold on.  I'll answer that.  The only reason Anthony and I were able to move on with our careers is because we do  have...  I'm checking out.  All right, whatever.  See, there's a problem with the phones.  Yeah.  They're hearing us really low. 
[00:37:00]  Holy ass.  I'm going to lose my mind.  Yeah.  I'm going to lose my mind.  It is hard enough to do a radio show every morning.  This stuff has to work every morning.  And I don't understand how it works the day before, and it doesn't work the next day.  How is that?  Emergency.  We have...  We can't...  The guys on the phones can't hear us.  It's very low.  Can't hear Opie either.  It's all very low.  Ben?  Ben comes in and stares at the board.  Like, you know what button to push here to fix this problem. 
[00:37:30]  Just let him herk and jerk and hit some buttons.  He'll hit something.  I'll fix it.  What are you going to hit, Ben?  There you go.  Ben just comes in and starts staring at the board like he knows what's going on.  I know you know what's going on, but you don't know this.  Anything?  The phone callers...  This is high-tech crap.  They hear us very low.  And then they start talking when we try to talk to them.  And it gets very upsetting when they go, I can't hear you.  I'm punching out.  One of these?  Ben, what are you doing?  One of what?  One of what?  Ben's pointing his stuff to one of these. 
[00:38:00]  One of these.  One of these.  He pointed at a cluster of 18 buttons and dials and switches.  One of these?  One of these.  Should I try one more?  You know, this is...  Unfortunately, we need the phones this break here.  Yeah, and the only way to do it is during the show.  It's a very interactive part of the program here.  Doug from Connecticut.  Hey, Gravy Boobs.  How you doing?  All right.  Now, can you hear us?  Hey, my theory also is they're trying to do something outweigh.  Doesn't that make you want to bite your own friggin' head off when that happens? 
[00:38:30]  Hey, hey, hey, Doug.  You can't hear us very well, can you?  Eh, not too bad.  Not too bad.  Maybe this guy's just a dope.  I mean, he's stupid.  Doug, are you just a dope or do we have a real problem here today?  No, seriously.  I can hear you both really good.  All right.  Then you're just a dope.  All right.  It's Doug.  He's just a dope.  So he was a dope for talking over us while we're trying to talk.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  We didn't really care what you had today.  We just wanted to use you to see if the phones work.  Your call was just being used to test the phones.  How do you feel today? 
[00:39:00]  You stink.  I was actually going to call you from out here.  Is it fixed?  Oh, you were?  Did you hear how to do a prank?  No.  You better let him out.  And then wave at you.  Hi, guys.  On the phone.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break and we'll continue with the O&A program.  What is this?  All right.  What's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup? 
[00:39:30]  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yup.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Ooh.  Wow, that's really nice.  What, what, what?  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not having a diva.  I'm a diva.  I want Starbucks coffee.  I'm a diva.  You betcha.  Jim Norton. 
[00:40:00]  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  Talk to the OPN Anthony show.  Oh, Black City.  Flambalim.  Yeah, Black City.  Flambalim.  Black City.  Flambalim.  Damn thing going wild.  Flambalim.  She's always ready.  Flambalim.  She's on Black City.  Flambalim.  Whoa, Black City.  Flambalim.  Yeah, Black City.  Flambalim.  That's spider bait. 
[00:40:30]  Spider bait.  Originally done by Ram Jam.  Ram Jam.  That's right.  Black Betty.  It's the OPN Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for everyone that is doing their part to get this radio show back on the map.  Right.  Oh, we'll get back to where we were.  Oh, we will.  We need to write a few tsunami songs, I think.  Because that will get us back where we want to be.  Oh, fired. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, back on the golf course.  Yeah.  Back in the cave with the mud people.  Back in the mountains hanging out with mountain chicks and their 70s Earth Mama muffs in the hot springs.  I forgot we were talking about that yesterday.  That's after we got off the air.  We were yapping about that.  Things we were doing when we were off.  What the hell was that?  It was, I was bringing up a trip to Colorado and we went to this mud cave. 
[00:41:30]  God, we completely ran out of things to do, didn't we?  Oh, I know why, because I think Jim was talking about how he was going to try that yoga.  Oh, you're going to try?  Oh, you're going to try yoga, yes.  Really?  Yes.  Now, where did you hear about this?  My friend Sue told me.  I've heard it before.  It's just that I want to do yoga because it's good for you.  And Opie said that Elo has done this.  Yeah.  Elo told me in my neighborhood they had this yoga class where they keep the room at, I don't know, some ridiculous temperature, like 120 degrees. 
[00:42:00]  I mean, just outrageously hot.  And the women do their yoga with barely any clothes on because it's so hot.  And he goes, look, man, I didn't go for the freaking yoga.  I went to check out the pieces of asses all around me.  Obviously, he didn't go for the yoga.  What do you think?  They're thinking looking at him.  No doubt.  Oh, that guy over there with the misshapen head just passing out after three minutes.  Oh, God.  So he told me I should check out this yoga place in my hood. 
[00:42:30]  Your hood.  And then Jimmy, after the show yesterday, was talking about how he was going to go try it as well.  Yeah.  At another location.  I don't know, whatever.  I need to have you somewhere.  Yeah.  If you ever call the Upper West Side of Manhattan the hood again.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, the hood.  Look, man, we got our own problems up there.  Yeah?  Everyone walking around with attitudes and their little dogs.  I hate it up there.  Old people with their faces stretched.  I absolutely hate living up there because there's no real people whatsoever. 
[00:43:00]  No.  No, I just want to talk to people.  I like to talk, Anthony.  Ugh.  I do, though.  Stink.  When you walk in the streets, you want to nod at someone and maybe have them acknowledge you, you know?  No.  I don't.  Nope.  This city is just filled with lonely people.  What are you doing now?  What's going on with the button adjustment here?  I was right.  Huh?  You were right, Ben.  Oh, Ben was right.  Ben had to say it.  Ben.  I was right.  He pointed at a dial.  All right.  And he just said.  You said it was the talkback, right? 
[00:43:30]  No, I said it was the talkback.  All right, because you just adjusted something that wasn't the talkback.  I said it was one of those dials, and then Mars just told me, he goes, it's the mix minus buttons there,  and there are dials, and that's what it was.  Aha.  Did you learn that in Washington?  Yes.  Yesterday.  I learned that at one of my meetings.  There was many meetings he attended.  Ben was at the XM Satellite Radio compound in Washington, D.C.  He had a lot of fun.  Anyway, so then, yeah, I don't like it up there.  No?  No, I don't.  I don't like talking to people, so that would be a great place for me. 
[00:44:00]  Not long conversations, but maybe an acknowledgement that you're sharing this earth with somebody would be nice.  Nah, that's what the suburbs are for.  If you're in the city, forge ahead.  You see the way I walk around in this city?  You can barely see a slit for eyes.  I swear to God, I like just bundling up when it's cold and putting my head down, and I almost bump into people.  I just follow like a crack on the sidewalk. 
[00:44:30]  It's like a little track that tells me where to go.  Yeah.  And that's it.  I don't want to look at anyone.  I don't want to deal with people.  I cannot stand human beings.  If I could leave this planet, go to Mars or something, Venus, I like that a lot better.  2020, that's when they're scheduled to go.  Is that it?  To Mars, yeah.  Thank God.  I'm very distracted because on the phones it says Rob from Long Island, and under comments it says,  wants to mail in girlfriends, T-H-I-G.  And then it cuts off right there.  Thong? 
[00:45:00]  No.  No, I'm thinking it might be his girlfriend's thigh.  Thigh.  That's why I think we have to go to this phone call.  It says, wants to mail in girlfriends, T-H-I-G.  What's the rest of this word?  Rob, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Yeah, no.  I got a pair of my girlfriend's old thigh highs that I wanted to mail it to you guys.  I'm sure Noah would put them on for like at least $5, you know?  Oh, thigh highs?  Yeah.  Big leather boots.  Oh, man.  That was a real letdown.  I thought it was a thigh.  I thought it was a serial killer or something.  I thought we had an exclusive on the program. 
[00:45:30]  It's some stupid thigh high joke.  Anyway, so we're talking about the hot yoga and stuff, and then it reminded me of just,  I don't know how we, I took this leap, but I was in Seattle and I was in a rainforest with  our old pal John O'Brien.  At least there's no people there, right?  And there were a couple girls involved, Anthony, because I'm not going down the java log road  again.  And we're walking up into this area where there's natural springs, hot springs, where basically 
[00:46:00]  the water is just, I mean, just boiling hot coming up from, you know, up from the ground.  Big forest with petrified java logs all over the place.  And someone could probably explain why this is.  I don't really care.  But basically what the locals do is they build these natural pools with rocks and mud.  So then the water collects in these pools, and then the people, you know, pretty much  lay around in these things naked.  People see it as some type of healing thing, some type of thing that's beneficial to health, 
[00:46:30]  because it's right out of the earth, and especially Seattle, you're just going to get a bunch of  these hippie type mentality people that just think that bathing in this bubbling water from  deep within the earth is going to help you out.  It was kind of cool, because there's a lot of mountain girls with 70s earth moms, completely  nude.  Great.  So John and I look at each other like, what the hell, let's give it a shot.  I wasn't brave enough to go nude. 
[00:47:00]  I kept my little underpants on.  You went in on your underpants?  Underpants.  Which made me look faggier, because everyone else was naked, but I'm like, you know what,  nah, I'm just not feeling it.  Wow.  You are really insecure about your schlong.  Not really.  Well, you're not willing to expose it any time.  Any time the opportunity has come up to expose it, you always back out.  I don't know, because I think when you know, like, John O'Brien's girlfriend was there. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, a little weird.  And my girlfriend at the time, which...  Yeah, that is weird.  Which is fine, but I think it's easier to get naked in front of people you don't really  know.  Strangers that you'll never see again.  And maybe your girlfriend, but, you know, if you're with your friends and their girls  are there, and you already know the dude, which makes it weird, and then his girlfriend's  there.  Yeah, you're right.  That image will never go away.  You're right.  That's the reason.  Yeah.  That's definitely the reason.  No, you should have talked to her and kept leaning in so your helmet was uncomfortably 
[00:48:00]  close to her hand, like, whispering to her.  Kind of brushing against her hand.  Did your friend's girlfriend get naked?  John O'Brien?  No, they didn't want to go in.  No?  Which made it, you know, a little strange, too.  So, they're kind of hanging outside the pool, just sitting on a rock as we're, like, frolicking  with the mountain women.  Yeah.  Checking them out and starting conversations with them and making them laugh so their big  mountain jugs go up and down a little bit.  Mountain jugs.  Were they, like, really hippies, though?  Oh, yeah, man. 
[00:48:30]  Were they, like, talking about nothing?  Dude, no joke.  70s Earth Mama Muffs.  And this was only, like, a year, two years ago, whatever it was.  Wow.  You know, and hairy armpits, all that fun stuff, so.  And was it warm out, or was it kind of cold out?  It was, uh.  Because a lot of people like doing that when it's really cold out.  No, it wasn't cold.  It was, like, a spring day.  Yeah.  You know, it was probably 70.  That's not bad, then.  It was cool, though.  And the whole, like, this whole mountainside is just a ton of them.  And people spend all day just going to different ones, socializing, checking it out. 
[00:49:00]  Some are, like, really small pools where, like, little, you know, couples go and really  get it on.  Have sex.  Yeah, because they're kind of hidden in, like, the woods and stuff.  And then there's, uh.  Looks like an egg drop soup.  And then there's much larger ones that.  Bubbling away.  Are as big as this room, at least.  At least.  Yeah.  And the water is, you know, anywhere.  Some of them are only a few inches, you know, high.  And others are a couple feet high with the hot water coming through.  It's pretty neat.  So then I mentioned that.  And then you were talking about, like, mud people or something. 
[00:49:30]  Oh.  In a cave in Arizona.  No, it's Colorado.  Oh, Colorado.  Okay.  Went to Colorado.  And there was this.  It's like a cave.  There's this place.  And people go there.  It's like they know where this is.  And it's a big thing.  And there's a few of them around in Colorado.  It's a big cave with hot springs coming up from the floor in some parts.  Like, really hot, bubbling, boiling water.  And it just makes steam in this place. 
[00:50:00]  So it is sweltering.  It's just stifling heat and steam.  And people go in there.  You know, you go into a locker room and you change into, like, this robe thing.  It's an actual locker room?  Yeah, yeah.  Outside the cave.  You walk into this place.  It's like a storefront on the side of a mountain.  And you walk in.  They also do, you know, nails and other things.  Facials, I guess.  And you walk down and you go to the locker room.  They have a solarium if you want to lay down in a room with plants and stuff. 
[00:50:30]  Real hippie crap.  And then you walk down further and you walk down these stairs and you go into these caves.  And there's mud kind of dripping because there's water dripping everywhere.  This natural water is filtering through this mountain.  Well, isn't water natural?  Well, yeah.  But it's not, like, piped in from the city or something.  It's natural water, really?  It's just bubbling up from the earth.  Very natural.  And when it comes through the cracks in this mountain, mud comes out. 
[00:51:00]  All kinds of this sulfur and just all kinds of minerals.  Oh, yes.  I forgot to mention that really fast.  I'm sorry.  When you said sulfur, just with my story, the smell of sulfur was absolutely horrific.  Really bad.  Really bad.  So what comes oozing out of these cave walls is this mud that's full of all these different minerals and stuff.  So people grab handfuls of this mud and rub it all over themselves and kind of sit there in this sweltering heat. 
[00:51:30]  And I'm like, all right, you know, I'll try it.  What the hell?  Go in there and...  Keep your underpants on?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had some kind of shorts on.  I can't remember if they, like, supplied some kind of ridiculous paper shorts.  No, you got to go with swim trunks or a bathing suit or something.  I guess some people go naked because it's dark in there.  And there's all these little corners, nooks, and crannies that you're walking around. 
[00:52:00]  And it's kind of dark.  You can't find your way around.  You walk in there and I guess somebody could be naked just sitting there covered in mud.  And after, like, five minutes, I couldn't take it.  First of all, the heat was just ridiculous.  And then the smell in this place.  I guess because of the sulfur and minerals oozing out of the walls.  And just sweaty, hippie people that are sitting there.  It smelled like just feet and armpits.  Just nasty.  Nasty.  Did you spread the mud all over your face? 
[00:52:30]  I didn't do any mud, no.  Why?  No mud.  I didn't want mud.  So what, did you just sit there on the side and watch everyone else have all their fun?  I sat in the steam for a while.  And I was like, uh, this sucks.  And I'm just miserable the whole time.  This stinks.  And I just, I was like, I'm leaving.  We were there with, like, my girlfriend and her family and stuff.  So I was like, I gotta go.  I'm out.  So I left and walked out. 
[00:53:00]  Just hippies.  It's a hippie thing.  And I'm the furthest thing from a goddamn hippie.  And what's the mud supposed to do?  It's supposed to have, again, that whole natural healing thing.  Oh, there are claims.  You know, you walk in and there's pamphlets and you read it.  And this place has been open since, like, the 1800s.  People would go there to rub this mud on themselves.  And it's supposed to heal and make you feel better and clean out your colon.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was in Sedona, Arizona in April. 
[00:53:30]  Sedona, Arizona.  Is it in Arizona?  Yeah.  That was Ryan.  You scared me.  All right.  Sedona, Arizona.  And they have, like, healing things there.  What is it called again?  The...  Holistic.  The vortexes.  Oh, the vortex.  I saw a show on that.  It was hysterical.  The vortex.  And you're supposed to, like, I don't know, like, climb up some of these cliffs and...  And stand where the vortex is.  Yeah.  And supposedly...  Some vortex, like, professional will tell you where to move and go and take your money.  And what is that supposed to do? 
[00:54:00]  I don't know.  It's supposed to put you in a place where the earth, some magnetic property of the earth  is supposed to help you out.  You've got to stand in an exact spot.  Dude, the whole town is all about the vortex.  Yeah, the vortex.  Sedona is one of the most beautiful places you could go in all of America with the Red Rocks  and stuff.  Yeah.  But they're all advertising the vortex.  Yeah.  And these professionals, these vortex pros, know where all these vortexes are.  So you pay them good money.  And they tell you where to stand and run around in circles. 
[00:54:30]  And it's really odd.  I saw a show on it.  And they just all look like lunatics.  I think it was on that Penn & Teller bullshit show.  The best is the locals.  I go, all right, come on, man.  Tell me the truth.  What's up with the vortex?  It's like, don't waste your money.  Of course not.  All us locals know it's a joke.  But, you know, it brings a lot of chorus.  Oh, they laugh.  They laugh at the people up on these plateaus.  And they're jumping and running around and doing things on the vortex.  What they should do is walk you up to the end of the cliff and then take your money and  put their foot in your spine and watch you plunge to your stupid death. 
[00:55:00]  And then all you hear as you're dying is them laughing and waving your cash at them.  Maybe I made up.  And Freak Show wants to know, what does it cost for the mud cave?  Wow.  Was it expensive?  No, not really.  Because, you know, these hippies don't have much money.  I think they make it up in volume.  And it's in the same area that these big hot springs are in.  And they've made pools, like huge community-sized swimming pools, out of these hot springs. 
[00:55:30]  They're fed with the hot springs.  Yeah, that's exactly what I saw.  But I mean built-in pools that they make that are the size of Olympic-sized swimming pools  that are filled on a daily basis with this water, this hot spring water.  And it's supposed to be, you know, it's supposed to help you.  And I looked at the pool and it's brown.  Because there's water coming from the ground.  So it's brown and it stinks like sulfur.  No.  I'll go to a nice hotel. 
[00:56:00]  They have heated swimming pools.  And I will swim in there.  I want to smell chlorine when I swim.  Not sulfur and hippie feet.  Hey, hippie.  Oh, there's goddamn hippies.  Goddamn hippie.  All right, we've got to step aside.  Very good.  Very good.  Norton, you've never done anything like that?  No.  Oh, come on, man.  I'm a hotel guy.  I don't like any outdoor crap ever.  That's me.  I don't like it.  And somehow I always get pushed into these things. 
[00:56:30]  You remember the famous hiking trip?  Upstate New York.  Yeah.  In the Catskills.  Oh, didn't you get lost or something?  Yep, thank you.  Thank you.  Me and my girlfriend go hiking.  On a little day hike, right?  On a day hike to go up to the top of this mountain and then back down the mountain.  We hike all the way up.  It just takes hours to hike up this.  And it's up.  It's uphill the whole way.  I'm just looking forward to down because at least your pal Gravity can work with you. 
[00:57:00]  We go up this mountain, have a little lunch, and go back down.  And my girlfriend goes, oh, I know another way down.  Uh-oh.  And now she's pointing to a trail on the other side of the mountain.  And I'm thinking in my head, this cannot be the way down.  I go, this is not the way down.  She goes, no, I remember taking this when I was a kid.  It's another way down.  All right. 
[00:57:30]  Let's go.  We go.  It wasn't another way down.  It was another way to some faraway land that I could not even fathom.  More mountains climbing.  I noticed when we started climbing up again.  We were going down and then all of a sudden the trail starts going up again.  I go, wait, we're going up a mountain again.  And then she was like, uh-oh, there's a problem.  Now, coming down the mountain in the new trail that we had gone down, there were some places that you can't get back up. 
[00:58:00]  I'm talking we were rock climbing, like climbing down sheer rock walls that you can't climb back up without mountain climbing equipment.  So now we can't turn around and go the way we came because you'd have to climb up the sheer rock wall.  So we continued, just kept going, kept going, going, going, going, going, going.  The sun's going down.  And I go, oh, brother.  And it's fall upstate.  It's going to get cold.  Then the rain starts.  It starts raining. 
[00:58:30]  We had brought, we had done, I mean, look at a manual of what not to do when you're hiking.  We did it all.  We did it all.  Had no food, no water, no appropriate clothing for the cold.  Kept just walking.  I figured this trail's got to end up somewhere.  So we just kept walking.  It got too dark now to walk because, like I said, it's not just a trail.  You're climbing up and down mountains.  Saw a sign that said, lean to.  And it was this way, like another mile.  So we had to hike another mile.  It's dark. 
[00:59:00]  Get on the way to the lean to before it got completely dark.  I'm walking.  And I see a black bear walking in front of me.  And I'm like, oh, this is all I need.  I'm going to get eaten by a goddamn bear upstate, lost in the woods.  Shock, yikes.  Shock, shock.  It's eaten by a black bear.  Eaten by a bear.  And you know, everyone that hates us would laugh, would just laugh.  And the black bear just moseyed along his way.  But now I'm just, it's in my head now that there are bears roaming around here. 
[00:59:30]  We get to the lean to.  What is a lean to?  It's this thing that I guess hunters use sometimes.  It's a little shelter thing.  It's a shelter.  It's not made out of sticks.  It's made out of wood.  And it's got a shingle roof on it.  But the whole front is open.  And people usually light fires if they have matches and dry wood.  They would light a fire in front and keep toasting warm all night.  Or roll out their sleeping bag for the night.  My girlfriend had her coat.  Keep dry just in case it starts raining during the night.  Right.  I've got to ask you, why didn't you just ask Steve for directions when he walked in front of you? 
[01:00:00]  With his sweet honey-covered face.  You went the wrong way down the mountain.  I told you to go the other way.  Yeah.  He has no idea.  He's walking to the street.  There he is.  He has no clue.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, Steve.  What happened?  What?  Nothing.  You bear of a man.  Did you secretly, like, nod your head toward the lean to to show Ant how to get there?  I really hate this part.  Yeah.  What?  It's like walking.  You know why? 
[01:00:30]  Because I have no idea what you guys are talking about in the other room.  And it's like walking into a hail of gunfire.  Like, and you have no idea.  Hello.  Exactly.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  We'd play that clip if we had our instant replay.  Yeah.  So we got to lean to.  Couldn't light a fire because there was nothing there.  We had no matches.  Tried in vain with, like, really cold, wet hands that weren't functioning anymore.  Like, I couldn't hold stuff.  You know when your hands get so cold and wet that you can't move your fingers? 
[01:01:00]  So there I am trying to, like, get a piece of damp newspaper I found on the lean to and, like, two rocks.  No way.  Like, I'm trying.  It's just that desperation right before you die of exposure.  You know, they find you with those dopey rocks in your frozen hands and some little wet piece of newspaper.  It just was not working.  And we figured, you know, the only thing we can do is really just go to sleep.  So we got a, she had a very light spring jacket. 
[01:01:30]  That's how they're going to find you.  Exactly.  That's it.  That's how they find you.  You don't go to sleep.  No.  You try to keep moving, but no.  Screw it.  Go to sleep.  So they find you, like, you know, holding each other frozen.  That's it.  So we lay down on the lean to and we're trying to, like, stay both of us covered with her little spring jacket.  And that was all we had, you know.  And it was the coldest, longest night I've ever spent in my life.  And then knowing that when you wake up, you're still lost in the middle of the woods. 
[01:02:00]  So we got up right when the sun came up and it was cold and pouring rain.  Yeah.  And we had to walk another, I don't know, I don't even know what it was.  It was miles.  How did you figure out, did you go, you couldn't go backwards at this point?  Nope.  Just kept walking down one trail, knowing it would pop out somewhere.  And it came out on a road that was just deserted.  And we ended up finding a park.  Yeah, some sort of park where there was a bathroom with running water. 
[01:02:30]  Because we had no water either.  And just spent time with my head under the faucet just drinking.  And then we found, like, a park ranger type station.  And that person drove us back to our car where we started.  And when we pulled up there, there's state police and everybody hanging out.  And we get out of the car.  Hi!  We're stupid city people!  Hi!  Like, oh, are you okay?  They got blankets on us and stuff.  And I was walking.  I was crippled.  My legs, dude, I could not walk. 
[01:03:00]  And I'm trying to make it like nothing's wrong.  Like, ah, no problem.  I dealt with it.  Fine.  And I'm walking like a newborn fawn.  Like, you ever take one of those hour-long dumps and your legs go numb?  And you stand up and try to walk out of the bathroom?  That's how I was.  Yeah, you get the butthickey.  Just awful.  I needed some of those chrome, crippled people crutches the way I was walking.  Horrible.  And they're offering us, you know, granola bars and fruit.  Are you okay?  Like, yeah, no problem.  Hi, we're stupid city people. 
[01:03:30]  Hi, we're stupid city people that should be dead right now.  I saw a bear!  I saw a big, fluffy bear in the woods!  Did you take a dump in the woods at all in the rain?  No, no, there was no dumping.  There was just, it was just this tunnel vision, keep walking, don't even for a second think  about the situation you're in, and just keep walking.  Why all the police and stuff and rangers?  The family started calling? 
[01:04:00]  My girlfriend's mother had reported us missing, yeah.  Oh, wow.  And we were missing overnight, so.  Wow.  It was just the worst situation.  And all this happened just in Central Park, huh?  Yeah.  It was very hard, and I didn't even know.  Central Park West was like, at one point we were so close to it.  Central Park.  We were in the middle of the forest, upstate New York.  That's very scary, man.  That's like, for real, this is real.  That was scary as hell. 
[01:04:30]  He just trotted along, you know, didn't even give me a look, but to know that there are  bears there, I was like, oh man.  Unbelievable.  Lucky it didn't have a cub.  You ever hear those stories of bears that have cubs, and someone stumbles on them?  Yeah.  Just stumble on them.  Tough to explain what's going on.  Like, no, no, no, we're just lost.  I was able to see him from a distance, because he had a flaming hat on.  And the music.  And the...  It's Martini Bear.  It's Martini Bear.  Cozy face on that bear.  It was so cozy. 
[01:05:00]  I just wanted to pet it.  It had a perfectly manicured beard.  Little soul patch.  Blonde head of white hair.  Yeah, a little blonde head.  It was the strangest thing.  A black bear with a blonde head.  That's classic.  Absolutely classic.  Yeah, and it was drinking heavily, too.  Could barely walk.  Sounds of music, that...  Yeah, it was watching porno, and...  All right, we should take a break, Anthony. 
[01:05:30]  We were going to break 15 minutes ago before that fine little story of yours.  Oh, God.  You know how we're trying to make the show more gooder every day?  Yeah.  Slowly but surely, all the pieces are coming back together.  That's our job.  We're finding stuff that we used to play, you know?  Because we weren't allowed to bring anything with us when we got fired.  No.  So we're...  I think we're about 50% there, to be honest with you.  We still have a lot of stuff to hunt down.  But we found this little ditty. 
[01:06:00]  You're going to love this, Anthony.  Huge fine by Eric.  Norm MacDonald talking about the gi.  Oh, I love this clip.  Talking about the gi.  Check this out, and we'll continue.  To be in bad taste.  As you look back on it.  Maybe at the time you thought it was a good play, but you look back on it and you think  that was in bad taste.  Well, sometimes, like in stand-up, I'll do jokes that are...  Like one time I was doing this thing in San Francisco, and there were all gay people  in the audience, they told me.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No.  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to you. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about...  Because I went to this gay pride parade, and I saw in it there were these old men and  old ladies with these signs that said, we are proud of our gay son.  You know?  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know?  Because it's not an achievement, you know?  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men are actually 
[01:07:00]  bragging, you know, at work, like they're, hey, Bill, you know, my kid, oh my God, we're  proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean?  And now he's articling over at a law firm, and oh yeah, he loves c**k.  You know?  That was good.  He can't get enough c**k in his mouth, his ass, his kid's all his c**k. 
[01:07:30]  I got a, I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's c**k.  I want to show it to him.  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello?  Hi, Mom.  Mom, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you too.  Welcome to the Opie...  Hello?  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back.  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:08:00]  Oof, finally.  XM202.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Bow down before the one you serve, you're going to get what you deserve. 
[01:08:30]  Bow down before the one you serve, you're going to get what you deserve.  All right, we're back.  These breaks are way too short.  We can't get anything done.  It's going to become a problem, I think.  It's affecting the rhythm of the show.  I'll figure it out.  You know, you talk for 40 minutes and then you want to stretch your legs, get your head  together, think about what you want to talk about next. 
[01:09:00]  Uh-huh.  I ran to the bathroom and all of a sudden they're like, you're back on the air.  I'm like, what?  We just took a break.  Got to figure that out, Anthony.  Got to figure it out.  Richard Freer from Jersey City, New Jersey.  F-R-E-I-R-E.  Richard Freer from Jersey City, New Jersey.  How about sending a few more instant feedbacks, you dick?  The guy's completely tying up our instant feedback with one message.  It's not even like he's trying to goof.  It's a message I guess he wanted us to, you know, check into the weird New Jersey magazine 
[01:09:30]  or something.  Enough with the weird New Jersey magazine.  I don't give a crap that there's weird people living in the woods in Jersey.  But he is completely tying up instant feedback.  Stop posting, you ass.  Silentcomedian at yahoo.com.  Silentcomedian at yahoo.com is his email address.  Could somebody please email him and tell him to stop?  Yeah, maybe one or two of the listeners out there could email silentcomedian at yahoo.com.  You know, we only need one or two of you guys. 
[01:10:00]  We don't know which one or two, so.  Richard Freer, F-R-E-I-R-E in Jersey City, New Jersey.  Maybe you can stop.  Maybe a couple of people, just one or two, could email him and tell him to knock it off.  Jack off.  What's the email address?  Richard Freer?  No, silentcomedian at yahoo.com.  Silentcomedian at yahoo.com.  There you go.  All right, Anthony.  Have fun checking your email, douchebag.  Yeah, enough. 
[01:10:30]  Enough.  We read all the instant feedback.  You don't have to send your stuff 10, 12, 15.  12 times.  20 times.  If we don't read it, it sucked.  Yeah.  We read it, believe me.  And we're saving you from the embarrassment of your awful line.  He just redid a joke that I did about Voss and then rewrote it cleverly.  Yeah, he's got that going, too.  All right.  What an ass.  I'm telling.  Anthony, the Johnny Carson tributes continue. 
[01:11:00]  Yes.  We've got some audio of Leno doing a very tearful monologue.  He did.  Well, he's a poser.  I mean, you know, no one's going to take the place of...  Did you see a little midget get proposed to?  Very nice.  Here's Leno last night.  Well, hi, everybody.  Welcome to the Tonight Show. 
[01:11:30]  As you all know, this has been a tough 24 hours for those of us that are fans of Johnny Carson.  Why'd you turn that off?  I had a line, damn it.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Tough 24 hours for Johnny.  And I go for Johnny and nothing's there.  You've got to leave those turned up.  Why is it a tough 24 hours for Jay Leno?  I know.  It's a great 24 hours for him because everyone's going to be...  You know, even more people are going to be tuning in to the show to see what he has to say.  That's what it comes down to. 
[01:12:00]  Why is it tough for him?  It's not.  Johnny Carson probably never talked to him after he left.  It's gold for him because people are going to be tuning in to see what he says.  Yeah, but they said it was tough because he had to cancel his appearance this weekend  at the Comedy Works in Albany.  And they said that made it tough for Leno because he was a big Carson fan  and he was too distraught to even perform this Friday and Saturday in Albany at the Comedy Works.  How dare you?  We're talking about a legend.  You're getting a cheap plug-in for your stupid comedy show. 
[01:12:30]  6-8-9-0-4-90.  Don't even call.  Who cares about that?  It's about Leno.  How dare you?  Don't even call.  You are horrid.  You know, I mean, Johnny Carson was a legend,  but he didn't want to hang out with any of these people.  So how is it tough on them?  He didn't like that.  Everyone knows that he turned into a recluse after he left The Tonight Show in 92.  Yep.  He didn't like any of you.  And he didn't like Leno.  Right. 
[01:13:00]  He wanted Letterman in that position.  He was a Letterman guy.  It came out last week that he was still writing jokes for Letterman.  Yeah.  You know, because he would watch the news every day and go,  Oh, I got a one-liner.  And he would send jokes off to Letterman and Letterman used some of them.  Right.  Not a lot of them, but every once in a while, one of those jokes that Letterman told was a Carson joke.  It came out last week.  And now Leno's going to say it's been a tough, tough 24 hours?  Carson hated you.  He's ripping me off.  Don't worry.  Jimmy's not going to comment because Jimmy will be on Leno again soon. 
[01:13:30]  I don't think he hated Leno, to be very honest with you.  I think he did want Letterman to replace him because that was his guy.  Honestly, all right, hate's a little strong, but he didn't care.  He didn't care about Leno.  He didn't care about any of these people.  You're not going to...  He had a small group of friends that he kept in touch with, and the rest of the time he spent it with his wife, and he was on a yacht.  He didn't want to be bothered by any of these jamokes.  I don't think he liked the idea of a replacement either.  He probably would have liked a whole new show to be put in there instead of the Tonight Show continuing, because then it's that about Schmidt thing, you know? 
[01:14:00]  It's the new young kid coming in, dumping all your stuff out in the dumpster in the back.  Dumping all your old jokes into the dumpster.  And I'm sure he would watch Letterman and wouldn't sit there and watch Leno on the Tonight Show, because you don't want to sit there and watch your own show, you know?  Well, the Late Show, you ever see the film about Leno and Letterman where they kind of indicate that he was squeezed out because of Helen Kushnick, who was Jay's manager at the time, who was relentless and awful, allegedly.  I mean, everyone who made her head of the guts.  Oh, that was huge news back then, what a prick bitch she was.  And Jay wanted to come on his first day and do a tribute to Carson his first day, because he understands, and then she forbade it, you know, and she was just an awful woman. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, well, I mean, all these celebrities are coming out of the woodwork, and they're, I don't know, are they a little bummed that Carson passed?  Sure, but they're more excited that they're getting FaceTime all over the country today, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Ed McMahon?  When was the last time you saw Ed?  Ed McMahon is enjoying that he's back in the spotlight.  When was the last time you saw Ed?  And he's on every, every newscast.  Jay Leno invited him on last night. 
[01:15:00]  Mm-hmm.  Did he come on?  Yeah, he was on.  I think we have a little audio of that, too.  But here's Jay Leno, you know, it was a tough 24 hours for Jay.  Very tough, man.  It wasn't tough for any of these guys.  I mean, sentimental, sure, bringing back some memories, but it wasn't like they actually lost a friend.  He wasn't bedside with Johnny.  Well, hi, everybody.  Welcome to The Tonight Show.  As you all know, this has been a tough 24 hours for those of us that are fans of Johnny Carson.  You know, I was thinking about what I could say about Johnny Carson, and I kept trying to search for something new that hadn't been said before. 
[01:15:30]  And after a couple hours, I realized that was impossible.  Maybe that was the greatest thing about Johnny.  Imagine getting to the end of your life, and there's no compliment.  You haven't been paid.  Johnny had that special quality of grace, charm, and dignity in the public arena.  He was an incredibly polite man, and when you were invited into his house, this show, you knew you were an honored guest. 
[01:16:00]  Before he became host of The Tonight Show, he was host of a show called Who Do You Trust?  Which was the perfect title for a show starring Johnny Carson, because the truth is, we trusted Johnny.  We trusted him to make us laugh, to entertain us, to speak for us with what was truly an American voice.  Johnny hosted this show for 30 years.  Think about that.  These days, some NBC shows don't last 30 days.  My God.  What made Johnny such a unique talent was, for 30 years he was hip, but he was smart enough not to be so hip that next year he was out of stock. 
[01:16:30]  Jay's really nervous, and Jay is sounding like he's narrating a movie.  I was just about to say, yeah, you know what sucks about this?  He's reading this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, his writers, I'm sure he didn't just write this.  If it was such a tough 24 hours, I guarantee, and this is where Jim and I disagree, I love Letterman.  I think he's great.  I think Letterman could have easily, I don't know what Letterman did.  I think Letterman's in reruns.  I like his statement, by the way.  Letterman's statement I liked.  Yeah, but Letterman would just.  Was it F him?  Letterman would just go out there, and this is the difference between the two, and just talk from his heart. 
[01:17:00]  Leno's reading something, a prepared statement.  Leno's writers got together, wrote a statement for him.  If you're so talented, and you took over Carson, you should be able to just walk out there and speak from your heart for a couple minutes.  Not read a statement.  No compliment can be paid that wasn't paid, and Johnny grew up in a small town in Nebraska, so he's doing a Johnny-mentry.  Yeah, well, you're right.  It's like a narration. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, there's no real heartfelt.  Letterman actually said, I liked what Letterman said.  I think it was a prepared statement, but he's like, any one of us that came after him were pretenders.  I thought that was a great thing to say.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I remember the rest of the statement, but I liked what he said, although I'm not a fan of his show at all.  Hip, but he was smart enough not to be so hip that next year he was out of style.  That was a fine, almost impossible line to walk, and no one did it better than Johnny Carson.  Johnny never went out of style.  As a comedian, he taught me it was okay to be known for doing political humor, but never make the mistake of thinking you're a political commentator. 
[01:18:00]  It's okay to satirize the society we live in.  Just don't start believing that you're a social commentator.  You know, people say this country is divided now, but these people forget the 60s and the early 70s.  There were daily marches.  There were race riots.  There were assassinations.  There were anti-war demonstrations.  Oh, the good old days.  We witnessed the most drastic cultural change in American history, but throughout it all,  no matter what the state of the world, it seemed to get its sanity back every night at 11.30. 
[01:18:30]  Johnny was a constant in our lives, and every night he made us feel okay about it.  And as good as Johnny was with the celebrities and the politicians, he was at his best with just ordinary folks.  Because they didn't treat him as Johnny Carson, the king of late night.  They treated him as Johnny Carson from Nebraska.  You know, there was always a moment he would ask him, you know, you say to someone, do you ever watch my show?  And the president would always say something like, no, I don't.  I don't stay up late unless there's something worthwhile to do. 
[01:19:00]  Well, Johnny loved that.  He would laugh and laugh and thought that was the greatest thing in the world.  And as a performer, I don't think I ever wanted to impress anyone more than Johnny Carson.  He had that effect on all comedians.  When he gave you the wave, that wink, or a little call over to the desk, nothing before or since has had such a profound effect on me.  As that one little gesture is, hey, come on over here.  You know, in the mid-80s, I started working as a guest host for Johnny, and it's strange.  And after all these years, I still feel like a guest host. 
[01:19:30]  Is this in real time, Jay?  Because he really built this place.  Everyone who does this for a living owes it to him.  December 90s.  Johnny was the best, plain and simple.  And the best way to sum it up is, I guess, you know, you had to be there.  If you were fortunate enough to be watching during Johnny's 30-year run, consider yourself lucky,  because you're not going to see the likes of him ever again.  Here's some favorite moments.  Oh, here's some favorite moments.  I love what you said about being a political commentator, and you're not like that with those two lessons. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  The comedians fall into it.  He was absolutely right.  Good point.  True.  Some people get a little too serious when it comes to that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, you look at The Daily Show, and Jon Stewart's a great comic, and they're talking  about him replacing Dan Rather.  I know.  Dude, you're not a real...  I'm not saying he wants that, but you're not a real news guy.  You're a comedian.  Is he going to be able to pull his collar and go...  On the news?  I don't think so.  Like, that's why I watch The Daily Show, is because it's funny, you know? 
[01:20:30]  You know, I don't think that's going to wash on the CBS News.  Yeah, they're doing a story about the tsunami.  Yeah.  It's going to break into a Woody Allen voice.  I don't think it's going to help.  They do that, and it tends to happen more with the left.  I'm sorry, but liberal comics tend to fall into this trigger with Garoppolo and a lot  of them.  Like, they think that they're all of a sudden these brilliant political voices.  It's like, you can skewer politics and trash it, but you're not this enlightened genius.  Your job is to make people laugh.  If you're not doing it making people laugh, you're cheating and you're a fraud.  You know who's really good at it?  Louis Black. 
[01:21:00]  Um, who?  Yeah, Louis, uh...  Wait, no, no, I've heard that name.  Don't tip me off.  Look, I'm pissed off at him, too.  But the fact is, I do find him funny.  Yes.  And, uh, you know, I can't be phony.  You know, I find the guy funny.  I also find him to be a prick because he hasn't even attempted to be on this program.  He's actually shunning it.  You know who's brilliant at it?  It's Colin.  There's nobody better than Colin being political and funny and biting and just vicious. 
[01:21:30]  Yep.  And always being funny.  Yeah.  Always being funny.  Unless he's on our show.  Well, then, you know.  That was Opie, boss.  Not me.  You should have, you know something?  You should have hung out after the show.  For some reason, after the show, we hung out for about 45 minutes in here after the  show, and we were laughing our asses off.  Well, roll tape next time.  I know.  Jesus.  I mean, did you ever hear...  It was like pulling teeth.  Yeah.  He tells a story.  I wish he would have done this, too.  He tells a story about bombing at De Niro's birthday party.  Oh, it's great.  Where he performed at Robert De Niro's birthday party, 50th or 60th. 
[01:22:00]  Dude, you're invited to De Niro's birthday party by De Niro's wife?  Yeah, by Grace Hightower.  Yeah.  And you show up, and for Colin, that had to be, you know, a dream come true.  Wouldn't accept money for it.  Just to skewer De Niro a little bit and roast him, and he bombed.  You're going to be in the company of De Niro's friends, Hollywood elite, and he bombed.  And he tells it, like, with a flop sweat, wrenching his nice suit that he's wearing.  Why didn't he tell that on the air friday? 
[01:22:30]  He kind of came in at like 9 something.  Don't forget, we were in the middle of other things.  Yeah.  We were like, ah, we got to get to this tape.  We were getting the tapes.  We were in the middle of just bombing in general on Friday.  It was weird.  It was like he came in, and we weren't able to sync up the rhythm with him until this  whole show is about getting a rhythm.  Yeah.  It happens.  Write that down for the next time Colin comes in.  We got to hear the story of him bombing at De Niro's birthday party.  He describes himself sweating and just silence, and some, like, cordial little titters coming  from some people. 
[01:23:00]  Can we get him on the phone?  It's embarrassing.  Is he up this early?  And Billy Crystal, just to, you know, who does not like Colin at all, because Colin always  trashed him.  Yeah.  You know, just sitting there smugly enjoying it.  Yeah, Billy Crystal, because Colin's trashed Billy Crystal, so Billy Crystal's watching  him bomb.  And in Colin's head, he's even thinking to himself, oh, Billy's watching me bomb.  He has an awful timing.  Every comedian can relate to that.  I mean, I'm sure Billy Crystal's not looking at Colin Quinn bombing, going, oh, this guy's  absolutely awful.  He's thinking, oh, my God, I know how that feels. 
[01:23:30]  Comics are ridiculous sons of bitches, and love the fact that another comic is bombing,  and it's not them.  Yep.  Comics love that.  And if you're friends with somebody, if I'm at a birthday party, and I'm watching Bob  Kelly eat his balls, I'm rolling.  I'm happy, and I'm enjoying his death.  But if it's a guy I genuinely don't like, I'm just sitting in the back, oh, die.  You suck.  Die.  It's like you're really rooting for them to bomb.  What is the Bob Kelly, Jerry Seinfeld story?  It's great, too.  Bob has to tell it only because I don't know the beginning of the story. 
[01:24:00]  There was some kind of a bet made with Seinfeld, which I don't know.  All right, let's get Bob Kelly on the phone.  It's a very funny story.  Let's get Bob on the phone.  Because the story of Bob Kelly with Seinfeld, it's so embarrassing.  It's so embarrassing.  Like everyone, you can kind of relate to it, too, because everyone's done something like  that where you're embarrassed.  But when it's Jerry Seinfeld that you're embarrassed in front of like this, it's horrific.  All right.  I know Bob Kelly listens to us on the replays.  Call us tomorrow to tell your Seinfeld story. 
[01:24:30]  There you go.  It's done.  Get up early, you loser.  Unless he calls now or someone gets in touch with him.  Maybe he will.  I don't know.  So now we got Leno and they dragged Ed McMahon out.  Oh, Johnny's sidekick for so many years.  Who doesn't remember plump Ed McMahon chuckling along?  Another guy that Johnny Carson didn't feel like hanging out with.  Nah.  At all.  Nah.  The guy that he did the radio, the TV show with for 30 years.  Nothing.  They went to lunch every once in a while.  Oh, oh.  Every once in a while. 
[01:25:00]  Right now, I want to welcome the man who shared the Tonight Show stage with Johnny for 30 years,  Mr. Ed McMahon, ladies and gentlemen.  A lot of hugs right here.  The Tonight Show, starring with special guest Tony Randall. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, thank you.  Standing ovation.  I appreciate that.  And I know Johnny somewhere is appreciating that.  Well, it's great.  No, he's not.  He's rotting.  He's dead.  Johnny's annoyed going, what are you giving this stupid second banana a round of applause for?  He did nothing but nod and laugh.  Standing ovation.  Jesus.  How great was their chemistry, though, man, between him and McMahon?  Like, Johnny would be doing Karnak and Ed would just repeat what he had just said.  And just the look he would give him, like, you fat asshole.  Jesus, shut up.  He was just a buffoon sitting there. 
[01:26:00]  Go back to your announcer's mic and leave me alone.  And Rickles would just come on and skewer everybody.  Yeah.  That's the greatest.  Johnny somewhere is appreciating that.  Well, it's great to see you.  Thank you.  You know, it really is great to see you because I feel this.  It's so great to see you that, uh, I'm sorry I haven't had you on in the last 10 years.  I've been here 10 years.  I haven't had you on.  I love this Hollywood phoniness.  I was, uh, really good to see you.  It was an oversight.  I'm sorry Johnny had to die for me to invite you on to the show, but it's great to see you. 
[01:26:30]  Bit of an oversight.  10 years.  Yeah, it's so great to see you.  Sure.  Jesus.  Great to see you because I feel this is like, I don't know, it's just, it's very emotional to see you now.  And I'm glad, I'm glad you could take the time to come here.  I'm very happy to be here.  Thank you.  And, uh, I had quite a day yesterday.  You can imagine, uh, Jeff Sotsik called me at 7 a.m.  And, uh, I had one of those days crying, laughing all day long.  And I just saw, by the way, your essay.  Was that marvelous, that essay he did?  Well, he called it an essay. 
[01:27:00]  An essay.  Essay.  Yeah.  An essay.  It was awful.  Wasn't that great, that Watto he did?  It was absolutely awful.  It was horrible.  That essay he did.  Well, uh, well, it's all true.  That's the first part.  But the clips, you know, and I was there, but I see him again, I laugh all over again.  And I've got hope for you.  You know, Johnny would always add some lightness, so I'll have a little lightness for you.  My son, Jeff, you just met him. 
[01:27:30]  He's with me.  Driving over, he told me, he's got a little five-year-old, my granddaughter, Sarah McMahon,  right?  Sarah Michael McMahon.  And so she's watching some of these clips, and she said, she turns, she says, Granddaddy  lost his best friend.  And, uh, she says, well, who in the world's going to replace him?  Oh, man.  Isn't that something?  Because she thinks the show is still on.  That's the story?  He's gone.  Shut up.  So there's a chance you could come in. 
[01:28:00]  No wonder you haven't been invited on the show in the last ten years.  That's all you got?  You worked with a guy for 30 years, and that's all you got?  Granddaddy lost his best friend.  Oh, shut up.  Who's going to replace him?  So I was hoping for some kind of punchline.  Yeah.  So I hit her and said, shut up, stupid.  Or I sang a tsunami parody at her.  What was that?  That's the type of question Voss would ask.  You lost your best friend.  Who's going to replace him?  Who's going to replace him? 
[01:28:30]  Hey, guys.  Let's say hi to Bob Kelly.  Bob.  Bob.  Bobby.  Bob.  Bob.  What's up?  What's up?  Hi, fella.  Can you hear him, man?  Can you hear us?  Hello?  Hello.  Can you hear us?  Yeah, I can hear.  Are you guys fucking with me with that whole thing?  No, no, actually not.  We're not.  We're actually having a problem with the phones.  The phones are my problems all day.  Hi, what's up, man?  Colin was in the other day, and he was telling us a story about you and Seinfeld, and it was 
[01:29:00]  a little embarrassing.  Yeah, that friggin' son of a bitch Seinfeld douchebag.  Would you like to tell us the story?  Yeah, I feel like I'm on The Tonight Show right now.  Yeah, Johnny.  I feel like I'm on The Tonight Show right now.  Norton's Ed.  I don't want to be Ed.  I want to be Doc.  Take one up the keister.  Is he gay?  I, uh...  He always seemed a little flamboyant. 
[01:29:30]  Seemed a little Noah-like.  Remember when he was filming Comedian?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Seinfeld.  Well, he was...  That son of a bitch was coming down with this little camera crew, and...  I never talked to him.  I never said nothing to him.  I never said nothing to famous people when they come down there.  And there's certain comedians...  You're talking about the comedy cellar, by the way, where most of that movie comedian  was filmed.  Yes.  Thank you.  Where all the big-time New York comics hang out when they're not on the road.  Right.  All right, there you go.  Sorry. 
[01:30:00]  Thanks.  So, this son of a bitch comes down.  I never said nothing to him.  I just...  You know, some comedians kiss their asses, you know.  Yeah.  Especially, he was filming, so there were certain comedians, Godfrey, that were just, you know,  sticking their faces in.  And I never said nothing to him.  One night, he says something to me.  I say something back.  I feel like we build up a rapport.  Rapport?  You know what I mean?  Like, it was organic.  What did he say?  Excuse me?  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  What's the code?  Because there's a door code to get down.  Is this seat taken?  Well, you know, it was kind of like a little conversation we had.  Yeah.  What was it about, Bob?  Was it something like a...  All right, so it wasn't that much of a conversation, but it was enough for me to maybe say hi to  him again.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  He said...  Did he ask why you were looking at that midget and crying?  Is that the first time he's done it?  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:31:00]  What is that?  I'll never live that down.  No, you won't.  And you wonder why I fuck sinks.  So I went and I did this gig up in Buffalo two days later.  The worst gig of my life.  I have to hire my own driver to pick me up to drive me to the gig.  This guy picks me up in a van, one of those, you know, one of those, you know, cool vans 
[01:31:30]  with the captain seats and the TV and the, you know, VCR.  Nice.  So he's got every Seinfeld episode ever, ever, ever, ever, and he's got headphones on and he's not watching and he's listening to them.  Jesus.  This guy's a Seinfeld freak.  So we go, we're driving to the gig.  He's telling me about Seinfeld.  He finds out I'm a comedian.  He starts calling me Jerry.  Oh, jeez.  I took him up to, we went to lunch, you know, because we had like an hour to kill. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  So the whole time he's telling me about, you know, his family and he's, you know, he's like, Jerry.  And I'm like, Bob.  He's like, I know, but I just really like Jerry.  So I'm like, okay, call me Jerry.  Oh, my God.  That's weird.  Did he ask you to listen to an audio cassette of his stand-up and put you on his show?  Jerry.  Jerry.  So.  Ma.  Nice talking to you.  So this guy, this guy asked me for an autograph, but, you know, I was like, you know what?  I might be able to get you one because I just talked to him the other night for the first time, me and my new buddy. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  So then I go to do this gig.  It's outside, after a band, in the rain, in the afternoon, next to a skydiving simulator at a beer fest.  So how was the gig?  It was all right.  It wasn't that bad.  I pulled it off.  You pulled it off.  So this gig was hell.  So I go back to New York. 
[01:33:00]  I met this guy.  I mean, I lived this Seinfeld episode.  Yeah.  This guy, the whole gig with the thing and the flight simulator.  I can't wait to see Jerry and tell him the gig, you know, tell him about the gig.  So the first time we talked, we made a bet.  I was making bets, and he jumped in on the bet.  So I owed him a buck because he won the bet.  That's why that was our conversation.  Oh, okay.  So he's on stage.  Do you remember what the bet was?  Yeah.  It was if Gretzky was on the team when the Rangers won the Stanley Cup. 
[01:33:30]  And, no, he wasn't.  All right.  And so he walks off stage, and I got my dollar out, and there's, like, a crowd of people going nuts.  He walks by me at the foot of the stairs in the cellar, and I go, here's your buck.  You won the bet.  And he looks at me with, like, I almost think that, you know, he could smell dog shit, but he doesn't know where it is.  Look.  And he took the buck, which kind of annoyed me that he took the buck. 
[01:34:00]  Of course.  And he didn't say nuts.  All right.  Don't worry about it.  He took it.  Yeah.  I go, but I got a story for you first.  He goes, you want your buck back?  So in my head, I'm like, what a fucking dick.  And he walks up two stairs, and he turns around, and he goes, I'll be upstairs in the back corner eating.  So when you're done, come up, and we'll talk upstairs.  So I go, all right, man.  I'll be up.  I'm doing my set. 
[01:34:30]  Right after my set, I'll come up.  We'll sit.  We'll talk.  He goes, not you.  He was talking to the lady next to me.  I was so, you understand, there's a crowd of people there.  The lady next to me looked at me like, I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  And then he just walked up the stairs.  How embarrassing.  Oh, for that split second, you're like, oh, my God, Jerry's inviting me up to his table. 
[01:35:00]  I'm going to hang.  And then, not you.  It was just the fact that I assumed that he would invite me from two sentences to sitting  down and having food with the guy.  Right.  And I'm like, yeah, I'll be right.  I said it so confident.  I was like, good.  I've got to do my set.  But right when I'm done with my set, I'll be up and I'll join you.  And then we'll talk about stories.  I've got to do my craft.  Not you, in that Jew voice. 
[01:35:30]  That is just big, fat lips.  Just not you.  That's a good story, man.  Oh, that rings through my head.  Oh, of course it does.  Any time my voice says, not you, it rings through my fucking head.  You know how embarrassing it is when you're walking down the street and someone waves  and goes, hey, and you wave back and then you realize it's somebody behind you that they're  waving at.  It's the worst feeling.  And you're all embarrassed.  Yeah, yeah.  It's got to be that times a thousand. 
[01:36:00]  Well.  It's Jerry Seinfeld, and you're in front of people, and that is the worst.  When Colin told me that, I couldn't stop laughing and feeling bad for you.  I cried like you at a midget wedding.  Dude, let me tell you something.  In my head, in like a split second, I literally saw myself being on his new show.  See?  I'm the new Kramer, and I was just a superstar.  For a split second, like.  Johnny Norton calling, just blowing him off. 
[01:36:30]  Jerry's inviting me to his table.  This is great.  All right, I'll be up right after I do my set.  Not you.  I finally made it.  Like, Jerry will tell people about Bob, like, oh, you've got to sit and talk to this guy.  He's out of his mind.  He's crazy.  Yeah, exactly.  Bob, they've offered me a show, and I need a help.  I need a writer, just like Larry was on Seinfeld.  I'd like you to be on this new project I'm working on.  Yeah, we need a professional person who knows about eating ass, and all those. 
[01:37:00]  And effing sinks, and.  Maybe you could be the tear Nazi.  The tear Nazi.  People come in with a sad story, and you just cry, and they walk out of your establishment.  God forbid I show emotion to a little girl who can't touch her face.  Little girl?  She was a woman.  Just happened to be a two foot tall.  We finally got the audio of that.  We're going to play after the break, by the way.  Finally.  We've been looking for that audio for weeks.  All right, Bob.  We're going to let you go.  We might call you back, because I think we're going to play the midget audio as well today. 
[01:37:30]  All right, guys.  I love all you guys.  You're the best, Bob.  Not you.  See you, man.  Bye.  All right, there he goes.  Bob Kelly.  Is that just an embarrassing story?  That's great.  Like, he's looking up the stairs at Jerry, looking down at you.  He says, when you're done, come on up.  We'll eat and talk.  And for that split, because you know, as a comic, he's standing there going, this is great.  Oh, my God.  What an in. 
[01:38:00]  You know, if you're going to network with a comedian, Seinfeld's the guy that you want to network with.  The guy, you know, took stand-up comedy and turned it into what every stand-up comic wants.  The most successful sitcom in history, you know.  And there he is, ready to go.  All the fantasies rushing through Bob's head.  Oh, yeah, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to tell.  The friends he's going to tell.  He's thinking about the friends he's going to tell that he hung out with Jerry.  And he invited him up to his table.  And the comedians that will see him walking in.  Right.  Like, we're all walking in, and there's Bob at Seinfeld's table chatting, having some fun. 
[01:38:30]  Chatting away.  Jerry throwing his head back.  Ha, ha, ha.  Laughing at Bob's banter.  Bob.  And Bob going, dude, I just can't do it.  I can't give you six weeks, Jerry.  I can't.  It's impossible.  It's impossible.  And then in that split second.  In that split second.  Not you.  Oh.  Because the comedy cellar, when you walk out of the showroom, you can make a right to leave, 
[01:39:00]  or the steps up to the left will take you up to the olive tree.  And it's very cramped.  Yeah.  And everybody, if Seinfeld was speaking, everybody is silently listening.  Of course.  Everyone heard it.  What a wonderfully horrible story.  Oh, dude, it's just awful.  That is irreprehensible.  It's really.  All right, Anthony, getting back to the Jay Leno stuff, we got another clip of McMahon on Leno last night.  We're talking about Johnny Carson, trying to get back on track here.  And then you were talking about a couple of urban legends as far as the Johnny Carson show goes.  And we got one of the audio clips, and then there was something else you want to bring up. 
[01:39:30]  And then we'll move on to the major audio.  A couple of urban legends.  But here's McMahon discussing with Jay Johnny's privacy.  Johnny was a very complex guy.  I mean, I don't pretend to know him.  I'd been to dinner and had been to his house.  But it was, I mean, explain a little about it.  Because he seemed incredibly not shy.  Yeah, he was.  Oh, totally shy.  You know, he was great with 10 million people, lousy with 10.  You know, the worst thing in the world.  And I did something to him. 
[01:40:00]  We had a show called Bloopers and Practical Jokes.  What?  Because he was great with 10 million people, lousy with 10.  Well.  Like your parties.  But I try.  Yeah, you have no chips.  Right.  And I got rid of the mouse, so I think people will start hanging out again.  Me and Ed in a jubalogue.  Ed, call the fire department.  All right, it's not that funny. 
[01:40:30]  Relax.  Don't relax.  There's a mouse in my house, and he was, I was chasing him with a piece of cheese trying  to get him out.  And, yes, Ed was over.  We lit a jubalogue.  And it started smoking in the whole house.  Smoking.  It looked like Doc in a band meeting.  You know, because they smoke pot, and I always joke about it. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Well, the fire department showed up.  It was like the mighty Carson art players walking in.  Oh.  There I was, and the doctors later told me that gave me emphysema.  A jubalogue in flames, emphysema. 
[01:41:30]  Great with 10 million, horrible with 10.  What's wrong with two men nude a jubalogue in some wine?  There was no nudity.  All right, well, get back to the clip.  Johnny was a very complex guy.  I mean, I don't pretend to know him.  I'd been to dinner, and I'd been to his house.  But it was, I mean, explain a little about it, because he seemed incredibly shy.  Yeah, he was.  Oh, totally shy.  You know, he was great with 10 million people, lousy with 10. 
[01:42:00]  You know, the worst thing in the world, and I did something to him.  We had a show called Bloopers and Practical Jokes.  You may remember with Dick Clark, and he produced it.  His company produced it.  So he caught me leaving the gate here with stuff loaded in the backseat of my car, my limousine,  and I thought I was going to be arrested.  You know, with all this stuff in the back, I thought my driver had done something wrong.  He caught me, nailed me.  All right?  So I figured I'm going to get back at him.  He went to Wimbledon, and we set up a thing in Wimbledon. 
[01:42:30]  We made him go to a cocktail party.  Brandon Tartikoff says, you've got to go to this party.  Got him to the party, and all these actors, beautiful British actors, were doing this gibberish.  They were talking gibberish, and he was there, and he hated every minute of it.  And the guy would say, well, Mr. Carson, you're from all for the continent.  Oh, I was wondering, have you ever been to London before?  Because I know this one, and then I knew.  And they're doing all this gibberish, and Johnny is there, and you can see the sweat starting from the eyebrows. 
[01:43:00]  You know, going down, and he's going, and he's looking for some place to hide, right?  He almost killed me.  Oh, he was so mad when he got in there.  And Ed wonders why Johnny never wanted to hang out with him.  Doesn't invite him over.  What a hack.  Yeah, thank you.  Practical jokes on Johnny, the guy that just wants privacy.  Doesn't want anyone screwing with him.  Goes to a restaurant, and Ed's playing jokes on him. 
[01:43:30]  Ugh.  Fat nothing.  Ugh.  What a prick.  Just trying to eat.  Has fake English people coming over to him.  Yeah, no wonder he never invited him over.  All right.  A couple of urban legends, Anthony?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, I was reading some of the message boards, and some people actually post this stuff as true.  And I bet people that are listening now will actually go, no, I remember seeing that.  There's two urban legends concerning the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. 
[01:44:00]  One of them is that Zsa Zsa Gabor was on the show as a guest, and she had a cat with her,  and the cat was on her lap, and she said, would you like to pet my pussy?  I thought that was Raquel Wells.  See?  The story gets all confused because it's an urban legend.  And she said, would you like to pet my pussy?  And Johnny said, yeah, as soon as you move that damn cat.  That never happened?  No, never, never happened. 
[01:44:30]  First of all, back then, it wouldn't have made it through the censors.  They would go nuts for something like that.  Well, did it not happen?  Did it happen, and then all of a sudden just get cut out of the show?  Nope, never, ever happened.  And there's actually a clip of Jane Fonda on an appearance on the show,  and she brought it up to Johnny, and Johnny dispels the whole thing.  If we could play it.  Well, you know, I've been bitching about this CD player for, you know, weeks.  Oh, look what's here. 
[01:45:00]  All right, here's the clip, Anthony.  That's good news.  Here's the clip.  All right.  I've got to ask you something.  Sure.  Last night, my son, you know, you were talking about Jaja Dabour earlier.  I think everybody's talking about it.  My son said, you know, she was on Johnny Carson's show one time.  She came there with a cat on her lap, and she said to you, do you want to pet my pussy?  And my son said that you said, I'd love to if you'd remove that damn cat.  I tell you, I... 
[01:45:30]  Is it true?  No, I think I would recall that.  Oh, that's a huge laugh.  That's great.  Can you believe that guy threw...  How great is the Tonight Show?  Good.  Yeah. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  The Tonight Show is always great to tune into because you would see stuff like that.  And that kind of stuff was never happening on regular TV, like during the day, during  prime time.  They would allot them a lot more latitude for doing material that was a little more risque.  Some of those Mighty Carson R player bits that he used to do had some double entendre and  stuff thrown in.  And the girl with the big blonde with the huge cans, and Johnny's constantly looking  right down her shirt and making tit jokes, you know, what amounted to tit jokes on television. 
[01:46:30]  But what if kids see that, though?  That's my concern.  Yeah, mine too.  You worry about children seeing that.  Mine too.  So that never happened?  Never happened.  Urban legend.  And the other one is that Arnold Palmer's wife was on the show, which is suspect right  there.  It's like, why is Arnold Palmer's wife on the show?  And Johnny asked if they have any good luck rituals.  And she said that, yeah, I kiss Arnold's balls before he plays, meaning his golf ball. 
[01:47:00]  And Johnny said that must put a flutter in his putter.  And that never happened.  Never happened.  Oh, God, that's awful.  I know.  Isn't that just horrible?  And when I read it on a message board, I'm like, that is so not true.  Some of these things, if you hear them or read them and you just know they're fake, you  wonder how anybody thinks these things are real.  And some guy posted it on a message board as, one of my favorite memories from The Tonight 
[01:47:30]  Show was when Arnold Palmer's wife was on and then tells the whole story.  And he actually has it as a memory in his head.  And he's one of those people, you cannot convince that never happened.  Because they actually believe it.  He's said it so many times that he actually thinks he heard it.  Yeah.  Do we have audio?  What are you doing?  No, unfortunately, we don't have audio of that.  No, no.  It never happened.  No, I mean of him dispelling it.  Actually, it was dispelled on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. 
[01:48:00]  Jay had Arnold Palmer on.  Oh, okay.  And he asked Arnold Palmer about it.  And Arnold Palmer said, no, it never happened.  And he goes, please don't ask me any more about it.  Because I guess, you know, having for years to hear about his wife kissing his balls must  upset Arnie.  He said to Jay or to the audience?  Like, to America?  He said to Jay.  You know, like, all right, don't ask me about it anymore.  What a baby.  Well, you know, he's probably one of those older conservative guys.  You know, his wife kissing his balls to everybody. 
[01:48:30]  That being the running joke about your wife.  Hey, Arnie.  Your wife going to kiss your balls today?  You hear it so many times, you're probably like, eh, enough.  You want to try one more clip, Johnny Carson?  You guys hear a noise?  Yeah, because they plug some stuff in.  They hooked some stuff up.  Hold on a minute.  Go ahead.  It's over, Johnny.  There you go.  They found our instant replays.  It's over, Johnny.  It just came off a truck.  They were sent to Washington, ended in Tennessee, and then back to Washington, now back in New York. 
[01:49:00]  I have no templates, though.  So you have no idea what you're playing?  Watch.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  It's just a, like, it's a mystery.  It's a sound effect grab bag.  What, you two?  Yeah, let me try one.  Give it a whirl.  Nothing.  You get nothing.  Nothing.  Let me try again.  Oh, good one. 
[01:49:30]  Thank you, Anthony.  How about this one?  You're just a tool.  Oh, all right.  Oh, yeah.  Well, how about...  You got a lot of laughs.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  Don't care.  All right.  Well, why don't we go to break, Anthony?  You can keep your hands off of my meal.  So we can get the instant replays all set up.  Right, right, right, right, right.  We got the midget audio, finally, of the little midget girl getting married.  We also have this great website called Rent-A-Midget that is very funny. 
[01:50:00]  I don't know if it's real, though.  We should try to get the guy that is running this website on the air to talk about it.  This guy from Wackbag is saying, Anthony, in that clip, Carson was being sarcastic when  he said, I think I would remember that tool.  No, he's not.  He's saying that it never happened.  Find the clip.  What an idiot.  They got just about every Tonight Show on tape, right?  That is not...  It's not real.  If it was real, someone would have that clip, don't you think?  Of course they would.  Stop being sarcastic. 
[01:50:30]  I think I would remember that.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Got a little Stephen Lynch song here, and we'll continue.  She got a smile, yeah, she got a smile, and she's flashing it right at me.  She got a wink, a wink across the bar, and I know that it's meant to be.  She got a walk, ooh, she walking over, and I know it could be my day. 
[01:51:00]  She got a friend, ooh, she's got a friend.  While she's standing in her way, it's a big fat friend.  Oh, God, there's always one.  Big fat friend.  Just for all my looking fun.  Now, baby, baby, baby, if it's boots you want or not,  leave your chubby friend at home because she's gonna block the car. 
[01:51:30]  Now, I'm afraid of no man with any I'll contend,  but I cannot compete with your big fat friend.  So, big fat friend, ah, we meet again.  You won't leave her alone.  You'll roll your eyes, make sarcastic comments  while you're sucking on that chicken bone. 
[01:52:00]  But that's okay.  You think you won the battle, but I tend to disagree.  See, I know you, and your Achilles heel,  and he's standing next to me, my non-discriminating friend.  So what's that in your account?  Non-discriminating friend.  I'll nail you anyhow.  I know that he's no looker, and he's had a couple rounds. 
[01:52:30]  But with every shot of Jaeger, hey, you lose a couple pounds.  Now, baby, baby, baby, bring the evening to an end.  Just you and me and my pal, and your big fat friend.  What kind of a show are you guys putting on here today? 
[01:53:00]  Cancel all avoidments.  Welcome to Radio Free America.  America's ready. I'm ready.  I want a million voices crying out in the wilderness.  Jesus, let's get serious.

Turn it off.  Hey!  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Turn it off.  Hey!  Guess who's back.  Guess who's back.  Shit.  Ah!  Oh, man.  If I was older, I would totally start jacking up right now. 
[01:54:00]  What the hell's doing?  We're going to have a problem here.  Hey!  This looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little way.  Hey!  Because it feels so good without me.  I'm saying, this looks like a job for me.  So everybody, just follow me.  Because we need a little way.  Hey!  Because it feels so good without me.  Hey!  Hey!  Okay, cut.  All right, here we go.  Hold your ears, folks.  It's showtime.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:54:30]  The virus is out.  I repeat, the virus is out.  O.B. and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  That's M202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  It's an O.B. and Anthony Wow Sticker Stop.

[01:55:00]  and pick up your Wow Stickers.  Those aren't real.  On the corner next to Jamba Juice, see opiananthony.com for a detailed map.  I'm getting an erection as we see.  Once again, here is how it shoots out.  The Wow Sticker Stop, brought to you by your pals at the O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[01:55:30]  Let's go to Texas and say hi to David.  Hey, David, what's going on today, man?  How much, guys?  What's going on?  We're rocking and rolling.  Hey, I drive a truck.  I was down in Texas over the weekend,  and me and my buddy went across the, they call it Boys Town over there.  Boys Town?  Yeah, it's called Boys Town, where all the whores are.  All right.  So I had one.  She was probably about 19. 
[01:56:00]  And I was so nervous, and my shit didn't work.  I took two Viagras, two hundreds, and nothing fucking happened at all.  Jimmy, 200 milligrams of Viagra, is that a lot?  What did you take that for?  I take 100 milligrams in Brazil, and I'm picking off three a night.  I took one, and nothing happened.  So I took another one about an hour later.  Still nothing happened.  So I got fucking problems, obviously.  Uh-oh.  But my buddy, he had five of them, five different ones in one night, 
[01:56:30]  and then the last one he had, after I went back, he had a tranny.  Well, the guy, the tranny blew him in the bar twice,  and then he gets him back to the motel room, pulls the pants off,  and the guy had a little, looked like about the size of a walnut.  He said he had it wrapped up in toilet paper and tucked back between his legs.  He said, well, I've gone this far.  Might as well go ahead and fuck him.  Oh, God.  No bag.  No bag. 
[01:57:00]  Wow.  All of them with no bag.  Hey, let me ask you.  There's a team player.  Why were you taking some?  Are you sure it was real Viagra, man?  I brought them in the pharmacy down there.  That's the only thing.  Well, the first one I took, you know, my face got really hot,  like it flushed, like they said it would.  Yep.  And then nothing ever happened after that.  So then I took the other one.  So, you know, I don't know.  So, you know, it's still Pfizer and it's in the package like it should be.  But I just, I don't know if it was real or not.  Either that or I got some serious medical issues. 
[01:57:30]  Do you have problems getting rods normally?  No, not normally.  I think I was just so nervous, probably.  Have you had a rod since?  Yeah, I have.  Well, then you're probably fine.  Yeah, it was probably just a little nervous.  Yeah, but he said he had that tranny and he went ahead and did it twice.  And then he woke up the next morning and he said, I'm gay now, aren't I?  And I said, no, you're not gay.  What, were you in bed together?  He woke up and turned to you?  No, I wasn't in bed with him.  He went to bed about 4.30 and I woke up about 6.  Did he put his face in your neck? 
[01:58:00]  Like I used to tell my girlfriend what me and her father would be doing,  whacking each other's bags and her father would put his face in my neck as he was finishing and go,  ugh.  Let me ask you something.  What was that clip where you guys were saying, the guy saying, turn it off, turn it off?  Is that from a movie?  Oh, yeah.  It's one of our favorite movies.  It wasn't hardcore.  It wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but we laughed so hard when we watched that movie.  It's starring George C. Scott.  George C. Scott, his daughter runs away and gets into the porn industry.  He's spending a lot of money.  He does porn, right?  Yeah, he's spending money on a private investigator trying to find her, and the investigator finds 
[01:58:30]  this film, takes him to a movie theater, pops it in, and he's sitting in the movie theater  chair watching the film of his little girl with two guys, and he just loses his mind  and starts, turn it off.  Yeah, he's just going crazy.  I'd play it right now, but don't mind.  Love you guys, man.  Punching out.  All right, the best is when he goes undercover as the producer of a porn film, and he's in  a seedy motel, and all these porn actors are coming in trying to get the part for this  movie that he's making. 
[01:59:00]  He's trying to find one of the guys that was in the movie with his daughter, so he dresses  like he would assume a porn director would dress.  It's just the worst pimp-type cowboy clothes.  And has an open call for young studs for his late porn movie, and they're coming in one  after another showing George C. Scott their junk.  And he can't look like he's freaking out, but he's freaking out.  All right.  And the guy's like, do you want to see my stuff?  And he's like, yeah, all right.  Well, because he didn't want his cover blown, because he knows he was looking for a white 
[01:59:30]  guy and a black guy comes in.  So he's like, obviously, this isn't the guy, but he didn't want...  So the guy's like, well, aren't you going to check out my stuff?  Well, all right, I guess.  I'm Big Dick Black.  All right.  Yeah.  And then other guys come in and show him their junk, and it's just a real uncomfortable  movie.  It's a comedy now, though.  That's a bit we could do.  You know, movies that weren't supposed to be comedies, but turn into comedies.  They are now.  And back then, I guess that was the most serious...  You know, that movie was taken seriously.  People watched it, and now it's so dated. 
[02:00:00]  The language, the clothes, the movie itself, subject matter.  It's just...  It's funny.  I still say about Schmidt wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but I laughed pretty damn hard.  I wasn't really laughing at that movie.  It was kind of like, ugh.  It was so awful that it just turned into comedy.  It was awful.  It was really awful.  But I got in an argument with a bunch of people online.  They're like, no, dude, that was supposed to be a comedy about Schmidt.  I thought it was, too.  I thought it was supposed to be a comedy.  People are showing it as this is a comedy, but when you're sitting in the movie theater 
[02:00:30]  and old ladies are crying all around you, I think it wasn't supposed to be a comedy, okay?  I just found it funny because I got a twist that sends a black humor in me.  I think they call that bittersweet.  It's like if you rubbed lemons on Steve's face.  That's bitter cozy.  This guy has a rolling wow sticker stop.  I have no idea what this means.  Let's go to Reaper, the trucker.  Reaper, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just called in to let you guys know I'm doing a rolling wow sticker stops for y'all. 
[02:01:00]  All right.  How are we supposed to find you if you're rolling?  Okay, well, I'm on the PA Turnpike right now.  I tried calling in a couple days already.  I can't give an exact location.  I'll be able to do better tomorrow.  But, I mean, if anybody listening, I'm on the PA Turnpike right now.  I'm about to get off to go up Interstate 99, LA.  I mean, if people are listening and they see me, I'm in a USA Turnpike.  I'm in a truck.  It's number 6083. 
[02:01:30]  You see me going down the road.  You flash your lights at me or whatever.  I'll pull over.  You come back to the truck.  I'll give you a couple stickers.  Do you understand how creepy that is and how that's not going to happen?  Right.  What are you going to just...  Jim, are you going to just...  Hey, thanks for hanging up on me.  When did we hang up on you?  When I called Eric one day and he said, hold on, Jim wants to talk to you.  And then the phone went dead.  I'm sorry.  Oh, all right.  I feel bad.  Why don't you offer gyno exams in the back of your truck, too?  That's the same level.  Awfulness.  Dude, you're probably the worst marketer for our radio show ever. 
[02:02:00]  How are people supposed to find you?  Are you going to, like, slow down to 55 miles an hour and just, like, reach your hand out the window and hope they can grab it?  Come on, grab a hold of this sticker.  You know, I was thinking about that.  I was thinking about getting a broomstick in some way, you know, doing it that way.  A rolling wow sticker stop.  Now I've heard it all as far as promotion for this radio show.  Like I said, as soon as I get my new run tomorrow, I'll be able to stop and then actually give an exact location where I'll be.  And then it'll be easier that way. 
[02:02:30]  But for right now, I mean, that's the only way I can do it.  Well, we look forward to your phone call tomorrow to see where you might stop for a little while.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Reaper.  He's trying.  No problem.  Anthony, he's trying.  He's trying to promote the radio show.  You know, we want to promote the radio show.  We asked for a pair of Super Bowl tickets a couple weeks ago.  Where's Herky Jerky Ben?  Where are we at with the Super Bowl tickets?  We've got two great teams in the bowl this year.  A lot of excitement.  Why would anyone want to go?  Everyone knows the Pats are going to win.  It's going to be a blowout.  We're huge in Philly. 
[02:03:00]  We're huge in Boston.  This is perfect for us.  We need a pair of Super Bowl tickets.  We want to bring back the chowder eating contest.  Isn't that favoring the Pats a little because it's chowder?  Well, maybe we can throw some cheesesteaks in there.  Cheesesteak and chowder challenge.  You think the mayor's going to have one of those wacky bets?  Of course.  I'll bet you a tub of New England clam chowder and you bet a cheesesteak.  I'll bet you a dirty bomb against some cheesesteaks, big fat-tongued mayor jackass. 
[02:03:30]  Like, maybe if Philly loses, they have to shoot a pregnant woman in the mayor's office,  and if Boston loses, they bring in Santa Claus and throw things at him in the office.  Why don't you really represent those cities properly?  Like, that's a bet I want to see.  You're right.  Yeah, because Giuliani was at one of those inaugural balls.  You know, obviously the ex-mayor of the city here, New York.  And he had some of his cowboy boots on, and they were kind of laughing.  I'm like, what the app?  You're dressing up for... 
[02:04:00]  Was he at the Suits and Boots ball or something?  Yeah, one of those.  And it was what he won from...  The Yankees played one of the Texas teams.  Hello, help me out, Yankee fans.  Rangers?  In the World Series that year.  The World Series?  The Yankees beat the Braves.  Texas is in the American League.  They didn't beat the Astros.  Well, then how did he get the boots?  Maybe it was on the playoffs or something.  Maybe it was playoffs or against the Rangers, yeah.  Oh, okay, all right.  So he won it from one of these mayor...  And he was wearing them at this shindig? 
[02:04:30]  At one of the inaugural parties.  That's the worst thing about having a cowboy as president.  You know, they have these parties, and it's like a good idea.  Let's have a Suits and Boots party.  And, like, all these city slickers have to put on these cowboy boots  and go down there, and they're completely out of place.  You know how out of place people look in New York, the tourists,  when you see one of those tourists walk by with the cowboy hat and the boots on?  Oh, yeah.  And he's looking around, and you're just like,  where is the homeless guy with the brick?  Because it's got to go over this guy's head. 
[02:05:00]  He's got no clue.  You know what I think in my head?  Rob him!  Exactly.  Just rob him.  Rob him!  Hello?  Exactly.  Just rob him.  And that's how out of place, like, Giuliani looks if he's wearing cowboy boots.  So, Ben, where are we at with the Super Bowl tickets?  They're working on it.  They're working on it.  I asked about it yesterday.  You know, I mean, they want us to take the show to the next level.  How about they help us take the show to the next level?  How about a pair of Super Bowl tickets?  That can't be hard for a big, huge company like XM. 
[02:05:30]  We need a pair of Super Bowl tickets.  I'm sure World Series tickets will be easy.  Dude, yeah.  You want to watch the World Series, do you?  We're on regular radio on one lousy station we could get Super Bowl tickets.  That's a no-brainer.  Get a pair of nosebleed tickets.  One lousy station was right.  You know, get the nosebleed tickets.  We'll give them away to a fan.  They won't know the difference until they make the ride down to Jacksonville,  because I'm sure we won't throw in the airfare like last time.  Of course not.  Get there yourself. 
[02:06:00]  Remember that?  Of course.  Broadcast live from Boston.  We had this whole Super Bowl show, and we gave out a pair of tickets.  Oh, by the way, you have to find a way.  Got to get there yourself.  Where was it last year?  Anyone remember?  Well, this was a couple years ago.  That was two years ago.  That was New Orleans, right?  Maybe.  Couldn't they get an airline on board, Continental, or somebody from Boston,  or USA, or wherever it is, to fly someone down there?  Well, the guy that won, remember, he sold them on eBay and then had a party all weekend.  That's right.  He sold them.  He probably couldn't get down there. 
[02:06:30]  Had to sell them.  One of our old bosses emailed me yesterday.  Yeah, he's got tickets because his station in Philly is broadcasting.  Tim Sabian?  Yeah, he's got tickets.  Tim Sabian?  Who's trying to call up Tim?  Never mind.  Who?  Well, yeah.  Wow, I almost said.  Ben, why don't we get to work on those Super Bowl tickets?  Ope wants them, Ant wants them, and I think the boys make a good point.  There you go.  Get a Super Bowl ticket.  Let's go to Craig in Jersey.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, Opey and Anthony.  Hey.  It's good to hear you guys again, man.  I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.  Did you just get the XM? 
[02:07:00]  I've had it since October.  Your first day.  Nice.  It was awful that first day.  Wow.  Thanks for hanging in there.  Yeah, really.  I'm real nervous, man.  This is like I've been waiting for you guys my whole life, man.  You are freaking out.  We can hear it in your voice.  Make it a good one.  You realize who you're talking to, right?  All right.  Yeah, I know.  Make it a good one.  Just two normal guys.  Don't screw up.  Don't screw up, man.  I know.  Get the car crash ready.  Do you realize that you're being heard all over America right now?  I know, man.  That's awesome.  Like people in California somewhere are listening to you, so don't get too nervous on us. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  All over the world, because people from England are listening.  Actually, I was reading an email today from Australia.  A lot of fans in Australia, yeah.  We have fans in England that show up at the comedy show.  So we really need you to just calm down, take a deep breath.  People count on these phone calls.  We rarely go to the phone, so don't be nervous, okay?  Okay, man.  It's not like Anthony and I are international radio stars known all over the world for our  same past incidents, so just calm down, okay?  Okay.  Right now, there's a single man in Modesto who really needs a laugh. 
[02:08:00]  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi.  You're the best, man.  Thanks, fella.  I'll tell you, you just remind me of me, you know?  I'm as sick of they come.  Without the comedy.  You make me feel good about it.  I'm like you.  I'm like you, man.  What?  I'm just like you.  Yeah.  You're nothing like me.  Hey, hardcore.  Yeah.  I love, I remember watching that, man.  Like, when it first started on HBO.  Hardcore.  So what happened, buddy?  I'm sorry, what happened?  You were watching hardcore? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, when that first came on HBO, when I was, like, around, like, 12, 13 years old,  I remember watching that, and when he was, like, setting himself up as, like, a big porno  guy, George C. Scott.  Yeah.  And that guy, Jim Sloan, comes in, you know, the guy that fucked his old lady, or fucked  his daughter.  Right.  Oh, is there we go?  And he's standing there, and he's like, oh, I particularly liked you in this one film,  you know?  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry, guys.  Let me back up.  First, the guy comes in.  Oh, he has to back up.  Yeah, that's never good in a call, sir.  I'm sorry.  It's always forward motion. 
[02:09:00]  All right.  When the guy, Jim, comes in, the guy that fucked his daughter comes in, he comes in, he goes,  oh, hi, guys.  My name's Jim Sloan, but my friends call me Jism Jim.  And, you know, he goes, you want to see my junk?  He pulls down his pants, and then I...  He's so nervous.  Oh, he's gulping.  Pull down his pants.  Go ahead.  I just waited for the Chris Farley line.  That was awesome.  That was awesome.  But, George, but George Scott, you know, he says, listen, I particularly liked you in 
[02:09:30]  this movie.  Dude, calm down.  The whole freaking country is listening to you right now.  Oh, man.  South Beach is listening.  Chicago's listening.  Right.  We got fans all the way up in Maine as they try to dig out for that snowstorm.  But then, Jim, George E. Scott starts taking a lamp and just fucking beating the shit  out of the guy.  Would you remember?  Yeah, but none of the guy called himself, what was his nickname?  Like, from what reason?  My name's Jim.  Yeah, but why was...  My friends call me Jizzum Jim. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, but what was the problem with George E. Scott, though?  Well, he was looking for his daughter.  Yeah, no, no, no.  But how come he didn't...  Because that was the guy that was fucking his daughter.  Yeah, but why was he mad at him when the bottom line is he wasn't really producing a  new film?  Because...  No, no, no, no, no, no.  He wasn't...  Because the guy was like, when he said, listen, when George E. Scott said, listen, I'm producing  a new film.  I particularly like you with this girl.  And Jim goes, no way, dude.  Dude, not that chick.  She was so fucking freaky, my goddamn cock hurt for, like, weeks afterward. 
[02:10:30]  There's no way.  There's no way I'm working with that fucking bitch again.  And then George E. Scott just rips the lamp right out of the wall and just starts smashing  it over his fucking head, remember?  In real life?  Yeah.  No, in the movie.  In the movie, yeah.  What movie?  Why did he sleep with George E. Scott's daughter, dude?  Why would you...  If you're working with George E. Scott, why would you try to...  George E. Scott's character in...  What movie was that again?  The movie Hardcore.  Oh, Hardcore.  Oh, you're talking about Hardcore.  Okay.  No, I was confused. 
[02:11:00]  Right, Craig.  And George E. Scott didn't hit him with a lamp.  He slapped him in the face and called him Yellowbelly.  Hey, listen, the other thing, you know, I watched Full Metal Jacket this weekend because  I'm trying to, like, really learn, like, where everything comes from on the show.  Yeah.  And, Jimmy, you talk about movies that suck, man.  That movie, I was like, at the end of it, I was just, like, sitting there.  I'm like, what the fuck happened?  What was the point of...  Wait, wait, wait, the beginning of Full Metal Jacket is great.  Wait, can I...  That was awesome, no doubt about it, with Pyle. 
[02:11:30]  But after that, like...  It did get weird.  When you find out that this guy is just, like, some field reporter, I'm like, I wanted fucking  Matthew Mordine to get his head blown apart or something at the end, you know?  It just ends with...  I've always said that...  ...Wayne or whatever?  I've always said that movie is, like, two different films.  Yes.  The first half is just awesome.  The second half has some moments, but, you know, it just doesn't compare to the first  half of that film.  Right.  The first part of the second half is the old guy going, what's that?  I'm trying to take a joke.  That guy was...  I'm trying to take a joke.  He was the best part of the second half of that movie.  Yeah.  All right, Craig. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you.  Bye, Craig.  Hey, Anthony and Anthony, man.  Oh, God.  I'm going to keep on rocking, and I'm going to punch out.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to call you guys back soon, okay?  Oh, you don't have to.  Trust me.  I'm going to keep getting better and better.  All right.  You don't really have plenty of room to grow.  I'll come down there.  That's right.  Craig, you don't have to call back soon.  No worries.  Let your appearance just sit there for a while.  Let people enjoy it.  Listen to the replay.  You can critique your own appearance and maybe work on it.  No, definitely.  Definitely until my wife hears me tonight, man.  She's going to definitely, you know, like, tell me that I have to get a new job. 
[02:12:30]  No, definitely.  I have too much time on my hands.  Definitely call back.  Okay.  Not you.  Hey, Jimmy.  All right, Craig.  Thank you.  Oh, and then he tries to get you.  Hey, Jimmy.  All right, listen.  Wow, was that a horrid phone call?  We really tripped him up, though.  I hope everyone else enjoyed the gulping.  The gulping.  Here's the deal.  Listen to me.  We don't mind cursing on this show, but just calm down with the cursing.  Yeah.  You know, if you've noticed, and some people have, and some people have actually criticized 
[02:13:00]  us, saying that we're taming the show down.  We're not taming the show down.  We said it right from the start.  The reason that it's so cool to be on satellite isn't the fact that you could just curse all the  time.  How many times?  Pull interviews.  For people that are saying we're taming the show down.  Pull the interviews we did before we even hit these airwaves, jerk-offs.  We said it's not about getting on and doing the F show all day long.  All day long.  It's not about that. 
[02:13:30]  It's about the stuff, the subject matter we can cover, how we can talk about it.  So when we say F, or we just don't curse, or say crap, it's not taming the show down.  It's just doing the show we want to do.  But the callers, Jesus Christ, they are just potty mouths.  We understand you're allowed to curse in this forum.  There's no FCC regulations against it.  But to have a call, it kind of takes away from your call if every other word is F this and 
[02:14:00]  S and, you know, the C word.  So just try to keep it in perspective.  And it's like profanity.  And anyone that's just tamed out, like as a stand-up, I can say whatever I want on stage.  I really, without any restrictions.  Sometimes you do, you use it as a vehicle at times.  But other times, like, if you keep doing it, it gets played out and it loses any effect.  And then people are like, ugh, I write already.  So even as a stand-up, I try to avoid it at times just for that reason.  You don't curse a lot?  Oh, I do curse.  Not you. 
[02:14:30]  You're talking to Eric.  No, but I was going to give him his buck for the story.  Right.  Remember?  We made the bet.  You're worth $250 million.  I'm just a little fat guy from Boston with a tear in his eye.  Remember?  And he took his dollar.  As he should have.  That Colonel Kurtz face.  Bald head.  Are you an assassin, Jerry?  I'm a millionaire.  You're neither.  I love it.  Oh, I really do want to just attack Bob with a machete.  He's sitting there looking at a book of poetry, trying to read out of it, but he's too stupid 
[02:15:00]  and he can't.  You know, speaking of the FCC, we should get into this a little bit.  Like a midget getting married on the edge of a straight razor.  Slithering, covering its face, and surviving.  It's my dream.  It's my nightmare.  We've got to get the midget audio as well.  We really have to finally play that today.  Yeah, so just keep in mind the fact that if you say every other word is a curse, it 
[02:15:30]  takes away from the meat of your calls.  No, but dude, you guys are toning it down, dude.  Yeah.  Yuck.  All right, Anthony, speaking of the FCC, I thought this story was pretty interesting.  Oh, yeah.  FCC rejects indecency complaints.  Now, you know, a lot of people just are all over the FCC thinking they're just out of control,  things like that, blah, blah, blah.  Everyone wants you and I, by the way, to comment on the Michael Powell resignation. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah.  We're not going to trash the guy.  We never had a problem with the FCC, believe it or not.  There were people that would complain about our show and send complaints into the FCC,  and the companies that we have worked for never paid a fine due to any content that we had on our show.  Never did.  But they've paid off, the last one, they paid off a bulk payment to get rid of a bunch of pending broadcasts. 
[02:16:30]  Possible problems.  Possible problems.  They just want to wipe the slate clean and decide, all right, we'll pay this amount to just get rid of all these possible complaints.  Yeah, so Infinity Broadcasting paid a big fine, but that was including our complaints.  The reality is, Ant and I over the years have studied the complaints that the FCC found objectionable.  We've sat down with lawyers, and we know how to do this type of edgy show and skirt around the issues, or we did, you know? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  And we find other ways to do our radio show instead of spending hours upon hours complaining that we can't do a radio show anymore because the FCC is up our butts.  It's just not the case.  I can't do a show.  And the fact is, yeah, Michael Powell resigned from the FCC.  They're going to get another schmuck in there that's going to do the same thing anyway.  We'll get a guy in there that's probably worse.  Probably worse.  Probably worse.  Sure.  It's all the administration above it.  If they're kind of coming down, then he's going to come down. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  I don't like Michael Powell.  I think they all stink.  But again, just whoever's above them is where the dictated morality comes from.  Yep.  They're thinking about taking that woman that's in there and putting her in charge, which would really be bad.  You put a woman in there?  Yes.  Oh.  Because their sensibilities are always on the side of humor.  Yeah, there's a lot of humor that is based in darkness, in sickness, in stuff that a lot of people might not find funny.  But put in context, it's very funny. 
[02:18:00]  And there are a lot of women that just cannot handle that type of humor.  And can I tell you, the Parent Television Council, I can't tell you how badly I hope a fire starts in their office.  Yeah, they're the organization that is causing problems for just about all of us.  I hear 99% of all complaints that come in.  Even more than 99%.  It was 99 point something percent of all the complaints that are brought to the FCC's attention is from this group.  From this group.  And they are...  So basically, they're trying to tell us, meaning all of us, us in the room and people listening to this radio show, 
[02:18:30]  they're trying to tell us what we should be able to hear on radio or watch on TV.  You know what these people are?  These groups like this, not even like this, this group.  This group.  What is it?  The Parent Television Council?  Parent Television Council.  You know what they are?  They're a bunch of people that are so effed up in the head, so perverse, so sick in the head,  with images of child molestation in their head.  Wants of pedophilia. 
[02:19:00]  Wants of rape and sick, disgusting masochism.  That's what these people are.  They can't deal with it.  And they're so ill and sick in the head that they need it taken away from everything,  or else they'll explode one day and kill and rape and molest children.  They can't handle the slightest bit of sexuality being dangled in front of them because they lose their mind.  They are all sick, sick people.  And they're usually not good parents.  No. 
[02:19:30]  They're the type of parents, again, like the Ramseys were, the type of parents that just throw your kids out there to succeed where you failed.  Right.  They just want their voices to be heard.  They just need to make a difference, and they're making the rest of us suffer because they are self-centered pigs.  And it's time for all these companies out there, Viacom, Clear Channel, Citadel, all the radio companies to start fighting back and stop being pussies.  Ignore these morons.  It's time to fight back.  Especially since you're not doing anything wrong.  Because this is the organization that is, you know, forcing radio to get tamer, TV to get tamer. 
[02:20:00]  It's this one lousy group.  They don't speak for the majority of this country.  Nope.  Whatsoever.  Small minority that wants to control all of us.  Right.  And who's at fault here is the big radio companies for being pussies.  For actually entertaining these people's complaints.  It's time to fight back.  These are sick weirdos.  Yep.  Sick, sick weirdos.  Yeah, they have their kids, and everything they do is under the guise of protecting children. 
[02:20:30]  But they're so caught up in these activities that they have, complaining about these shows, trying to find every little innuendo on television and radio.  That they neglect their children, and their children wind up growing up as screwed up as they are.  In a weird way, I feel almost sorry for the FCC today that they have to deal with this crap.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  There's a whole list.  We're going to get into a few of these. 
[02:21:00]  A whole list of complaints that came in from this group.  What is it again?  Parents Television Council.  Thank you.  Yeah.  So these were a bunch of complaints that they filed with the FCC, and the FCC has spent a lot of time and write back and tell them,  no, this isn't indecency, calm down, relax, okay?  Because a lot of people think the FCC is just jumping on every little complaint and making people's life a living hell.  It's just not true.  It isn't, okay?  And they've got examples, and it's just great reading.  We should put this up on our website or something. 
[02:21:30]  It's hilarious.  Page after page of them complaining about television.  The line below is a description of the allegedly indecent material cited in PTC's complaints.  They have about 36 of them that the FCC says, will you guys calm down?  There's nothing wrong with the material here.  It's become their whole existence, man.  They need it to exist, or they won't have anything that they can latch on to.  They're empty people who have not made a difference, and they just need their voices to be heard.  Well, you know, this is like the people that sit there all day and dial 911 and call the police to their house for no reason, 
[02:22:00]  and then eventually they're arrested for doing this.  That should be what happens to these people.  You can't file complaint after complaint and abuse an organization or a commission like the FCC and not have some kind of consequence.  I find it funny that there are people in this organization that are outraged by some of these clips from these TV shows.  Because they're sick, weird people. 
[02:22:30]  I'm laughing my ass off.  Like, let's just get right into it.  The show Everwood, a character.  Everwood, the name alone.  Everwood?  Right.  Come on.  It's the guy that took 200 milligrams of Viagra down there in Boys Town.  Everwood.  That's Neverwood, that stupid limp idiot.  I know.  I couldn't get an erection, and I cried alone, mumbling fool.  Everwood, a character on that show remarks to another, I got this black guy because of you, dick.  Yeah.  They had a problem with that.  They had a problem with that and filed a complaint with the FCC because of that line in that TV show. 
[02:23:00]  The guy's name was Dick.  Was it?  No.  But everyone says you, you dick.  Dick.  It's part of, you know, language now.  Fastlane.  I've never even heard of the show Fastlane.  No.  One character threatens another by stating, in my next life, I'm coming back as a pair of pliers,  and pull off your nutsack.  All right.  That's fine.  It was fine.  The FCC said no problem there.  Girls Club. 
[02:23:30]  A young female attorney says to an older male attorney, those power dicks are going to start  giving me trials.  The attorney responds, is that what you call us?  Power dicks?  Power dicks.  Wow.  It's bad stuff.  They're using the word dick a lot on TV.  They hate the word dick.  Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.  Because it reminds them of when they close their eyes, what they think of inserting into  their own children or into their own nephews and nieces.  Exactly.  You can't be this crazed about the slightest bit of sexual content without having some sick, 
[02:24:00]  twisted, devious thoughts going through your head.  It's just the way it is.  This parents' television council is full of perverted weirdos that want to have sex  with children.  Yes.  And they want to have the most bizarre type of vile sex with maybe people of their own  sex.  Women.  Rape is usually huge fantasies in these people's heads.  They're sick, sick people who cannot take it. 
[02:24:30]  Where do you get your research from?  Me?  Yeah.  I just know this.  It's a lot like the church.  Yep.  A lot like the church.  There are people who are supposed to be good.  They're doing this.  It's supposed to be for the greater good of people.  They're sacrificing many things to give their life to God and to people in the religion.  And meanwhile, you saw what was happening.  Homosexuality, pedophilia, running rampant, things they're not supposed to be doing. 
[02:25:00]  I don't think you're getting into that line of work because you want to make these sacrifices.  You're getting into that line of work because you can't face what the reality of your life  is.  So you figure, I guess a few people figure if they give their life over to God, they won't  have to live this sexually deviant lifestyle.  Some think it's picking grounds for what they enjoy.  You know, there's different reasons you get involved in this, but the bottom line is you're  just not right in the head. 
[02:25:30]  It's also about they want to force the rest of society to do something so they can repress  their own demons, their own sick thoughts and feelings.  And it's like, you know, it's not my fault.  You look at children and you think those odd things.  I don't look at children.  I hate kids.  I couldn't get a rod around a kid because their stupid child crying would annoy me.  That's why I don't think about them.  I'm not concerned with them.  Right.  Well, more examples.  We've got to get right back into this.  Girls Club, again, this TV show, I guess.  A female character remarks, I'm not feeling too sexual these days, especially here. 
[02:26:00]  I'm having a little trouble with one of the power dicks.  They're overusing that line, I think, on Girls Club.  Yeah, maybe that's why the show stinks.  Got to get better writing.  Dawson's Creek, Anthony.  They had a problem with Dawson's Creek.  Dawson's Creek.  One character remarks to another, listen, I know that you're pissed at your dad for flaky.  It doesn't mean he's a bad dad, and it doesn't mean he doesn't love you.  Another character responds, no, it just means he's a dick.  Oh, sorry, I was dozing off at Dawson's Creek. 
[02:26:30]  Dialogue?  Some of their dialogue.  Well, I guess the word dick is prevalent throughout all these complaints.  That's upsetting the PTC.  Dawson's Creek, again, character tells another, you're being a dick.  Now, Austin Powers, the spy who shagged me.  That has been, that's on their list.  Of course it is.  And they sent an FCC complaint in, and the FCC said, no, sorry.  And it was a musical number during which the title character's naked torso and genital area are blocked by objects, furniture, 
[02:27:00]  and in one instance, by his hands.  Remember that, Austin Powers?  Great scene.  Gets to the beginning.  Great scene.  Very funny.  He's moving things around, and it's hiding his junk.  Very funny scene.  Do you find that titillating?  Do you think people out there found that titillating or just really funny?  No, only sick, weird people would find that titillating and have this need that it'd be taken off because it's getting them excited,  and God knows what sick thing they might do when they get excited.  And why in the hell should other people enjoy this because they are able to watch this and enjoy it without committing some sick crime when, quite frankly, these people cannot? 
[02:27:30]  So they want to just eliminate it.  Take it away.  Take away all my temptations.  I'm too sick to deal with it.  That's what they're saying.  Later scenes include the use of the phrase fat bastard.  Not allowed to say fat bastard?  And the word?  And the word testicles.  Oh, my God.  That really is upsetting, though.  And then, of course, a male and female character are in bed together with no sexual or excretory organs or activities depicted or discussed, and they complain about that. 
[02:28:00]  NYPD Blue, that dickhead in a wheelchair, was said.  Who complained about that?  Dana Reeves?  Wow.  Wow, that's bad.  Friends, female character says that she has to go because she's got an invasive vaginal exam to get to. 
[02:28:30]  I don't get it.  Why isn't this group being fined for tying up a federal committee?  Have you noticed there's a couple examples here where there's a male and a female just in bed doing nothing?  There's a scene maybe of them in bed talking, doing some dialogue, and they had a problem with that and threw a complaint at the FCC.  Didn't Mancow sue, actually, the guy who was harassing his show in Chicago? 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, but the pussy backed out of it after a while.  Who did?  Mancow.  But didn't the guy stop making complaints because it was harassed, what I'm saying?  I don't think so.  I think they made some kind of a deal, but he's still complaining.  You want to take that guy and just bite his face and smack his children?  It's these people's power base.  It's their popularity.  It's their 15 minutes of fame.  And that's all it is.  God, that bothers me.  WWE did it too.  WWE did what?  They sued. 
[02:29:30]  They sued what?  They went after the parents' television council for harassing their sponsors and interfering with their TV shows and stuff.  We're trying to find the article now, but they took them to court.  Good.  Line in Scrubs.  Yeah, let's go there.  Good.  The character antagonizes the brother by telling the fiancÃ©e he wanted to love her up and down and all around  and that they should go put some more of your footprints on the ceiling.  How is that anything to complain to?  How would that even raise a red flag unless you're so deranged? 
[02:30:00]  You're so sick.  Oof.  In another scene, a male doctor tells a female resident that he would rather listen to her go on and on about the joys of dolphin sex.  Whoa.  That's tough.  These people really have got to get a life.  The Dolphin Television Council complained about that one, I hear.  If this is offending them, they really need to get a life.  Dolphin Television.  But they can never turn it on because the electricity gets wet in the water.  What are you going to do? 
[02:30:30]  I lost a fin to diabetes.  I'm a dolphin.  We really ought to send him over to that parent's television channel just to vomit all over their tables into their shag rugs.  Oh, there he is.  Just a couple more examples.  Anthony, the One Tree Hill show here.  In a school hallway, a male character tells a female character, I've got something for you. 
[02:31:00]  And she replies, I know you do, gorgeous.  He then gives her a book telling her she might want to check it out.  And she replies, oh, I definitely want to check it out.  I suppose I could read the book, too.  So, wow.  They are really getting slim here with anything that could be complained about.  But that shows you where they are.  That shows you the mentality.  They're dishonest.  They're not honest people.  They're liars.  Yep.  Let's see.  Will and Grace.  They had a problem with Will and Grace. 
[02:31:30]  A male character studying to become a nurse remarks to a male friend that he's taken his own blood pressure many times.  To which the friend replies, yeah, and how many times on your arm?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Thinking that he's going to grab his junk and take his blood pressure on that.  There's a leap.  Boy, every little thing.  He was talking about penis.  Oh, my God.  I can't think.  I'm thinking about penis.  Oh, I've got to go to the kid next door and grab his.  Yep.  Sickos.  You sick, disturbed jackasses. 
[02:32:00]  Scrubs again.  A male character and a female character is depicted in bed.  They have a huge problem with this.  And they're under the covers.  The male character asks the female character if it's a good time to start talking about a nickname for his penis.  Mm-hmm.  They had a problem with that, Anthony.  Yeah.  If you're in the bedroom of the Parent and Selvaging Council, you can nickname your penis Dirty.  Dirty.  Bad.  Filthy thing.  Evil.  The FCC also has denied bringing any fines against Saving Private Ryan. 
[02:32:30]  Remember?  It was aired in November.  Who complained?  Same people.  Same people.  Parents, Television Council, Saving Private Ryan goes on.  They play it uncut.  There's a lot of use of the F word and stuff because it's a war movie.  Trying to be accurate.  And dirty language was thrown around back then, I think.  And the FCC said, no.  Complained against 159 ABC affiliates. 
[02:33:00]  And they denied it.  Good.  Good for you.  Scumbags.  Good for you.  How many people are a member of this group?  A few hundred thousand?  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's a pretty big group.  It really is.  It can't be that big.  Bunch of soccer moms.  They're not getting boned properly at home.  Right.  Their husbands are repressed by sexuals.  Or again, with the fantasy of pedophilia.  They're not getting what they need.  Yep.  So they close their legs, put on their slacks, and need to get out this aggression some other way.  That's it.  Sorry you're married to Duds, sweetheart. 
[02:33:30]  Sorry about that.  Yep.  Oops.  Or the husband is so whipped that he's got to listen to what his wife says.  And his wife is just nagging that we've got to do something to protect the children.  And the husband, instead of backhanding her, says, okay, put me on the list.  Well, these are women, obviously, that didn't work.  They decided to raise children.  And instead of just being satisfied that you're raising children, they realize that they see all these other women working and having careers and that their lives are a little empty. 
[02:34:00]  They don't have a whole lot going on because their whole life has been to lay on their back and pump out kids.  Sorry.  Maybe that was enough in 1950.  It's not enough for you now.  Don't take it out on the rest of the country because you made that decision.  Just grab a lucky.  Grab a lucky.  Oh.  Parents Television Council.  That's why I hate kids.  There it is.  Where are they?  Parentstv.org.  Parentstv.org.  And that's where you can find them.  TV?  Transvestite?  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  Dirty.  Dirty.  That's filthy.  Parentstv.org.  I'm sure they have all kinds of places you could send letters.  Maybe our audience can maybe go to this website and voice their concerns about how these people are sending in FCC complaints.  Please be intelligent because, I mean, this is a serious topic.  And it really is time to just fight back.  Opie, I'm sure plenty of our listeners will be intelligent.  And I'm sure there's a few that will slip through the cracks that won't be intelligent.  Silly goose, you mean.  But that's a representation of America itself. 
[02:35:00]  And I believe that's an accurate representation.  And I think they'll get both.  All right.  We're going to play another Stephen Lynch song.  All righty.  You were talking about the church and stuff.  Yes.  And the things that go on in the church.  It's been very, very outrageous, this song.  Very outrageous.  Not a verse anymore.  Great.  Jesus.  Oh, man. 
[02:35:30]  That's bad.  Deep in prayer, my cross to bear.  I kneel upon the floor.  Temptations of a Catholic priest are easy to ignore.  But I cannot control myself.  It rips my soul apart.  For one small sheep among my flock has stolen a shepherd's heart. 
[02:36:00]  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  At Sunday mass or Bible class, I catch him in my view.  So I close my eyes, but there he lies, spread eagled on the pew. 
[02:36:30]  And when I see him in that frock, my conscience goes awry.  I'll give him some communion wine that's spiked with Spanish fly.  Altar boy, altar boy, is it going to be heaven or hell?  You can play my organ all night long. 
[02:37:00]  If you promise never to tell.  Shh.  Ooh.  Oh, Father.  What's in heaven?  Hallowed be thy name.  I could dress him up like the Pope.  And then I, oh, dear God, the shame.  No, no, lead us not into temptation.  Deliver us from sin. 
[02:37:30]  We could pretend that he was Jesus Christ.  And I was Mary Magdalene.  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  Oh, altar boy, oh, altar boy, confess your sins to me. 
[02:38:00]  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  Tori.  Torii.  Torii. 
[02:38:30]  Torii.  on this come out i don't mean it don't mean you know what you may have been  on it  the whole  all i want is to get laid in these sandwiches that's it that's the closest  reverence you can get to something cool  if you're going to be cool out if you're going to be  uh-huh 
[02:39:00]  yeah  where do you go when your wife changes the lines you'll be in every show i want to be  on you well  you've come to the right place i help you you help me we all laugh  don't worry we're not listening to this is a boring conversation  she walked past them  you have no idea what they are  shut up bring on the booze  this is the only thing that they don't think that's okay 
[02:39:30]  opium anthony xm202  perfect time and we're back with the opium anthony program a lot of people want the noah update our intern that uh...  is a bit on the feminine side i mean that's fair to say 
[02:40:00]  well people are uh... i'm not going to agree with you but it doesn't mean you're gay i i don't really know where i guess we'll try to figure that out as uh... as your tenure here continues but what i do want to bring up today is i've never seen anyone wear a baseball cap gayer in my life  the way it's sitting on your head  i've never seen anyone wear a baseball cap like you're wearing it and i've seen baseball caps worn all sorts of ways anthony  you see the rally caps at the met games you see the uh... the baseball cap on backwards right the homies have it uh... you know a little sideways little sideways with a perfect angle and i've even seen it all inside out upside down on your head 
[02:40:30]  i think it looks pretty normal i think you're looking too deep into it i think you're looking for innuendos  no no dude i've never seen a baseball cap sit on someone's head like that that hat looks perfect if you're on the witness stand with denzel washington as your lawyer  you know what i from it's like uh... i don't know it's like a conductor's hat i would really like to be able to describe it but i really can't i'm troubled i think we need a picture 
[02:41:00]  well i can tell you it's a bmw hat yeah no it's nothing to do with a hat it's the way it's sitting on your head it's so far back on your head that the the brim itself  the the the visor part is sitting on the front of your head but i have a big head that's one thing 
[02:41:30]  well it's it's almost like the way that like vic morrow would wear his hat in 1948  oh very good in combat like yeah or or in blackboard jungle like that that old vibe with the little teeny hat on the large head  yeah and the little uh the open collared shirt  that's the other problem that the hat's too small for your head  you look like you know what it looks like you look like an english private school student  really yeah yeah i think at least i toned it down today i mean do you think well no  you have three buttons buttoned not at all 
[02:42:00]  the only reason that's not buttoned any lower is because the jacket itself isn't  no no i mean by the way what was the last girlfriend's name  what's that last girlfriend's name  yeah of course it was julie  him stop we all know it was julie people uh  people are like oh what happened we got a cliffhanger yesterday and you're not uh telling us  i read a lot of i read a lot of the feedback i'm sorry to hear that  and uh people are saying because i hesitated on air yesterday that you know it's questionable about my  sexuality right but i think in my defense i think i hesitated because i'm just not the type of person 
[02:42:30]  i don't think it was the hesitation that got to the uh listeners quite frankly no i i think it was more  your voice i think it was the uh but it had a little bit to do with the hesitation  the when we said what's your what was your girlfriend's name the first thing you said  was what's my girlfriend's what was my girlfriend's name i know like when you ask  when you answer the question by repeating the question that is a textbook  textbook signal for somebody is not being honest 
[02:43:00]  i mean you could read it in you know interrogators will tell you this the police will tell you this  that's just how it goes and i think that the problem was that we had we showed you the naked  girl and we have audio of you looking at the naked girl oh you want me to play that now yes  this raised some eyebrows yes i don't remember this vomiting is that vomiting i hear 
[02:43:30]  of course you don't i don't remember this of course you don't and then the smacking of the lips that  yeah there were a lot of telltale signs that you're really nervous of um well i mean not being  completely honest is what i think being on this putting the spot about something personal makes  me nervous danny has just handed me a note oh danny who's leading the charge of uh interns that  don't like uh no is this like becoming a club or something i'm not in that club i like you thank  you yeah you can i appreciate it you can share uh the microphone with noah why not if you want 
[02:44:00]  air time you got to get right up to noah no just no no just hold that microphone right in front  of his face and smack his cheek with it lupus is not a girl's disease is it it's a black disease  no black disease that's sickle cell lupus is a disease of both genders oh i'm sorry i apologize  i apologize from danny's just so i don't get attacked so i moved to another microphone are  you afraid that he's one of those matthew shepherd guys that might like like want to beat you up but  they have weird feelings like as he punches you he's letting his hand rest on your smooth chest a 
[02:44:30]  little too well i actually got feedback like that in reference to matthew shepherd in particular  which surprised me huh but um no there's no there's no you got really big you got a really  big collar on today too i mean it's just wide lapels yeah just the way i like to dress i don't  i don't see and what kind of blazer is that today is that an expensive blazer no not really it's been  on our public dude you think about what you wear every day which is fine but i mean we all get here

[02:45:30]  any unless we have an interview or something stupid to do after the show you will see me in  this same sweater all week friday i will be wearing the same thing it'll be a little rankier but i don't  care sweater itself or the same type of sweater no the same sweater well perhaps you ought to change  the sweater trust me i'm paying attention i'm smelling the clothes making sure there's nothing  happening but i'll put on some deodorant i'll throw some cologne on and i'll make sure i don't have bad  breath and i'll come in here and do the radio show to be honest i woke up late this morning and i didn't 
[02:46:00]  take time to pick out my outfit like five minutes it took you don't believe me it's true no no he  was a little distracted by the way your hand was moving while you're playing actually i don't even  disagree because i i find myself a lot of times i will wear like the same socks or the same like  clothes for a couple of days you know i've done that i don't give any thought whatsoever i bet you  what i put on now in the morning i as i move my hand if you just get up like that and it's not a 
[02:46:30]  deal i'm very animated by the way yes you like to talk with your hands yeah your hand is always  like moving like a magician would move it as he's you know trying to kind of like you have a tough  time keeping your your hand up when you talk it's just kind of patience here i don't know no no no  no no no we're just pointing out things that are actually anthony and i are very observant that's  why we're as popular as we are we observe human nature and we uh comment on it that's why we get paid  the big bucks there noah so uh we got danny in the studio danny what is the problem today

[02:49:30]  big bear helping helping the little guy with his microphone helping a small cub i was gonna say  i do believe they call him a cub  i was we couldn't hear his uh his fabulous commentary in the other room so i was simply  assisting oh we heard it  yeah  it's martini steve  well i have to say that um being a jewish guy you usually you get a pretty hairy chest and i just 
[02:50:00]  don't like having that you don't like that so fair enough fair enough i think that's a very good  explanation today fair enough sir fair enough nothing to do with being a fairy could you pull  that could you pull the hat down though yeah but i have like a big head that's the reason did you  wear that to try to be a little more manly today and you figured all right i'll wear a hat  with us all the time you can ask anybody who are you going to ask  my roommates  ah  ah roommate well let's get into that a little bit  noah's roommates 
[02:50:30]  noah's roommates so you you have roommates is this a house  no this is a dorm  a dorm okay so you're in the dorm over uh myu i guess  yes i am  and uh how many roommates in the dorm  i have three other roommates  three other roommates  it's uh sweet  yes  sweet scene is what that is  uh okay so so three roommates and uh  what are they like  what are they like uh  one of them is going into the business world  like financial business student  yeah  other one is uh political guy

[02:51:30]  well you know  he does all kinds of like protest stuff  i remember like  in uh like 2001  he got on like mtv  and did this big siege of trl  oh wow  tough guy  what a jizz bag  war protest and stuff like that  yeah war protest guy  why don't you just say that his parents probably have money right  yes  of course they do  he's a guilt ridden upper middle class kid  who uh can't deal with his own superiority complex  so he decides he's going to go out there and make a difference  but he really just wants attention  to shame mommy and daddy  there you go  your roommate  when you say what your roommate do  say he's a bucket of jism 
[02:52:00]  that's what he is  there you go  uh do these roommates have uh girlfriends  um one of them does  one  no actually two of them do  two of them do  two of them do  and you've seen the girls  yes i have  i have seen the girls  uh-huh  all right  until you like your girlfriend  do you like my girlfriend  i don't have one at the moment  oh that's right  that's right  i'm sorry  not julie  so the first time you had sex  you were on a couch at a party  in front of party goers  i'm not back to this  that's what we heard yesterday  for people that didn't hear yesterday's show  uh uh apparently 
[02:52:30]  noah had his first sexual experience  with a girl  at a house party  on the couch  um where you know  there's party goers around  it's a little odd  that you would choose that time and place  as your first time  you know  a lot of people  a little  inhibited their first time  anthony um  i got a question for noah  uh-huh  ricky martin fan  no  absolutely not  oh  who do you uh  like listening to  who do i like listening to  i like listening to  led zeppelin actually  uh-huh  and  most people don't believe that  for my age  because i'm young 
[02:53:00]  and people are like  how can you be  well it's not  they're not believing it  because of your age  but yeah  all right  all right  what else  what else zeppelin  what else besides zeppelin  rolling stones  do you like watching  robert plant in those old  like the song remains the same  in that uh  is that his  that's the name of that  live zeppelin thing  jeans he had on  like a bruce dickerson  iron maiden poster  certain ones just stand out  i met him uh  about a year and a half ago  because i worked for his  record company  as an intern  and uh  still wears the same jeans  but uh  doesn't  it's not exactly the same  no  yeah  yeah certain things  yeah 
[02:53:30]  and so you like the stones  zeppelin  yep  yep  anything current  anything current  that you're into  current i like  i don't know  like maroon 5  yeah  like new stuff  all right  if you were to be gay  what celebrity  would you have sex with  if i were to be  yeah  if you had the biggest celebrity  for me it's ozzy osbourne  wow jimmy  yeah  i talked about years ago  that's kind of nasty though  exactly  but it's not about the sex  why would it be  why would it be nasty  to have sex with ozzy  because he's kind of  uh  old guy 
[02:54:00]  so there are guys  that would be better  than ozzy  i mean i would think so  we had paid dirt  because he's an older guy  that's a good point  that's actually  that's fair  and he's not in good shape  he's not in good shape  it's not that he's a guy  it's just that he's an older guy  right  so if you weren't  let's just say  let's go out on a limb here  say if you weren't  attractive  why are we going out on a limb  i'm just going out on a limb  i'm saying  well let's go out on a limb  if you weren't  jimmy said he'd have sex  with ozzy if he was gay  and you said that's nasty  because ozzy's  you know  old and in bad shape 
[02:54:30]  and he's  right  so who would you have sex with  if you were gay  yeah  what celebrity  if i was  if you had to pick  yeah  god that's a hard one  i don't know  i know there's a lot of choices  but i mean if you had to narrow it down  yeah  for a first experience  uh i'd say jude law  is a good looking guy  jude law  yeah  all right  get a little jude law  who's jude law  english actor  okay  what's he been in  jude law  he was in uh  a a a i  and uh  i don't watch a lot of his movies  he was a i  he was just in that movie  um 
[02:55:00]  a i  anal insertion  well that's the porn version of uh  of uh  the kubrick film  sure  wasn't he just in alfie  yeah he was  he was the lead in alfie  sure  so you'd have sex with jude law  jude law  jude law was hosting the saturday night live  i didn't say i would  we don't do it  he's just saying  i said if that  when  all right  so what  what were you  without my choices  right  what is it that made you pick him  what is it that made me pick him  yeah  fair question  i told you why i picked ozzy  uh 
[02:55:30]  i guess  out of all the choices  he's  decent looking  so there's a lot of choices out there  is he in good shape  i  assume so  for a pretty  he's a pretty popular actor  a lot of girls like him  yeah  all right  all right  thank you  what uh  what female celebrity  do you find attractive  female celebrity  uh  i would say  katherine zeta jones  katherine zeta jones  yeah  okay  it's kind of like a hacky answer  yeah  you know what i mean  it's like saying  do you watch football 
[02:56:00]  and you don't watch football  you can just go  yeah like dallas  right  you can pull out  america's team  kind of thing  i got you  i don't see anything wrong  with that answer  i don't see anything wrong  nothing at all  with the answer  the answer's fine  nothing at all  all right no  for me the female celebrity  i'd like to bang the most  is madeline stowe  that's always the one  that i thought was the sexiest  yeah i've always thought  she was the hottest  okay  so jude law  if you had to pick a second choice  second choice  who would be second  yeah jude is busy  oh god  yes  doing another bad  jude is uh busy 
[02:56:30]  banging broad  so yeah  you gotta pick someone else  i don't  i've never given this  any thoughts  so i don't  all right  well just give it a second  well you pulled jude  lauder  thin air  yeah  well there are images  in your head right now  i'm sure  who comes to mind  honestly  yeah  who's going through  the rolodex right now  in your head  who comes to mind  uh  because if you had to do it  but there had to be  kissing involved too  it wouldn't just be like  sex  it would have to be like  a gentle nice experience  right right  that's what i'm saying  because you're not gay  if you don't kiss  right  so you'd have to kiss the guy too  right yes 
[02:57:00]  right  and hold his chin  right  with your  right  thumb and pointer  very tenderly  gently  and then do this  shh  um  i guess  all right  i guess i would go with  matt damon  and i would say  matt damon  second uh  second choice  matt damon  all right  matt damon  but you asked  understandable  it's because we asked  well let's ask danny  danny if you were gay  who would you have sex with  i want to hear this  there is no correct answer  to this question 
[02:57:30]  wow  the recruit knows  i don't think  i don't know  do you understand  that everyone in the other room  is yelling and screaming  and trying to help you out  going do not answer  that question  they're all like  screaming  i can see through the glass  going no  see no  you never answer that question  that's  that's the thing  that every guy  seems to know  when you're asked that  you just never answer it  i don't know  there is no correct answer 
[02:58:00]  because he said  well he picked jude law first  but then you  like when the kissing thing came  you said matt damon  obviously he's a better actor  i think he's a better actor  he's probably better looking  i mean you may think  jude law is better looking  but i think matt damon  is better looking  all right  well noah  thank you very much  of course  anytime  our new intern  again  might i say  fabulous appearance  thank you  thank you  good job  fabulous  thank you  as uh noah leaves the studio  because we're playing a lot of  stephen lynch songs  i figured uh this would be  appropriate  i don't know if we're breaking  but we'll play the song  i hope he's listening 
[02:58:30]  if you are man  this one's for you  here we are dear old friend  you and i drunk again  laughs have been had  tears have been shed 
[02:59:00]  maybe the whiskey's gone to my hand  but if i were gay  i would give you my heart  and if i were gay  you'd be my work of art  and if i were gay  we would swim in romance  but i'm not gay  so get your hand out of my pants  it's not that i don't care 
[02:59:30]  i do  i just don't see myself in you  another time  another scene  i'd be right behind you  if you know what i mean  cause if i were gay  i would give you my soul  and if i were gay  i would give you my whole being  and if i were gay  we would tear down the walls 
[03:00:00]  but i'm not gay  so won't you stop cupping my hand  laughs  it's radio  we've never hugged  we've never kissed  i've never been intimate  with your fist  but you have opened  brand new doors  get over here  and drop 
[03:00:30]  your  drawers  welcome to the opie and anthony  it's in my shoes  ramone 
[03:01:00]  clean this up  the opie and anthony show  youtube vertigo  tour dates  tour dates were announced  i don't know  a day or two ago  basically they're coming to your city 
[03:01:30]  i mean  yeah  they don't  they don't miss anybody  they pretty much don't miss anyone  been gonna go  unless you're in the middle of nowhere  black crows are reuniting anthony  more music news  never black crows fan  the only reason the black crows are reuniting  chris robinson went off on his own  he made a  a pretty cool record  but it didn't sell  and didn't get radio airplay  and uh...  and uh... now he's uh...  getting back together with his brother  who he hates  and uh... they'll do the black crows thing again  what back  you're wrong about that  they're not coming to every city  they had to cut  three weeks of the tour off 
[03:02:00]  yeah they're like not doing washington  they're doing new york and boston and philly  but  because of  an illness in the edges family  they cut off the first three weeks of the leg  so a lot of cities are actually going to miss  and then they'll hit them in the summer  it was sick though  they don't know  someone in his family  one of his kids or something  that blows  but  are they still doing albany by the way  january 28th 29th  yes  yes they are  the comedy works  they were making a little  they were doing a small venue there  they wanted to do a small venue in albany  oh that is great  you are the worst  someone in edge's family is sick 
[03:02:30]  and you felt like you needed to plug your comedy gig  yes  well  yeah  look at where I'm going to be  I'm on the edge to obscenity  all right so then you got the black crows reuniting  queen reunion  how do you do that without Freddie Mercury  noah could sing  no  you just play the record  and you have an urn sitting on a stool  that is the worst  with a robe on it  look I  look I understand  some of these bands are called bands 
[03:03:00]  because everyone is very important  okay  yeah  when it comes to queen  and some people will argue  brian may blah blah blah  brian may was a big part of the queen sound  all right  that guitar  but  how do you go on without Freddie Mercury  there are bands  that lose a lead singer  they can move on  like ACDC did a pretty good job with it  Van Halen obviously  yeah  there's a bunch of examples  but queen without Freddie Mercury  that's like sacrilege I think  it certainly is  but they're going to do it 
[03:03:30]  they see dollar signs  and they're going to figure something out  that's what it is  a lot of people want to see this retro stuff  you know more of a joke  Luke you know  no offense to what's his name there  from the cult  but when the Doors got together  with I forgot his name  oh yeah  Ian right  Ian Asbury or whatever  Ian Asbury  yeah  they had him as Jim Morrison  I mean stop  yeah  that was a little  the rest of the Doors are very delusional  if they think they had much to do  with the Doors' success  no offense  they had a cool sound  Robbie Krieger was great on guitar 
[03:04:00]  and all that  but it was all about Jim Morrison  certainly was  and his voice  and there's so much time  that can go by  that you can actually  put someone else in there  and keep the band going  a little too much time  has gone by  with the Doors  that they could just drop in  another guy  that was all about  just getting some money  of course it was  you know  and John Densmore  is really bitter  yeah  he's the most bitter in the group  and he had the least amount  to do with the band's success  you ever watch him  in those old concert 
[03:04:30]  films and stuff  pretty dull to watch  he's like a jazz drummer  yeah  the drummers back then  I don't know  they weren't doing anything  very few  were really out there  a lot of them  were just keeping rhythm  it wasn't like he was  Neil Peart or anything  he was just like  yeah  just tapping away  real easily  it was all about Morrison  they could have got  ten guys to do his role  in that band  you know  get Ringo  he was a drummer  oh 
[03:05:00]  all right  well  whatever  all right  we got Oscar news  Oscar  oh  really fast  just announced  do we have our  chink entertainment girl  that's gonna  just trying to be like  Hot 97  don't fire me  let me make a quick  prediction here  that's for  if they're gonna give  anything to Jamie Foxx  it'll be for supporting  and collateral  because again  that's a safe role  you think they're gonna  throw him a bone  they just  they never  this is true  they never seem  to give black performers  what  Denzel  but not in the role 
[03:05:30]  like that's a safe role  a dirty cop  that was like Scarface  Halle Berry  very good film  but also again  look at the position  of a role she was in  as opposed to  giving it to Denzel  for something like  Hurricane  which was an amazing  performance  or X  which he really  deserved it for  right  so you think  Jamie Foxx  for collateral  which isn't really  the role  Jamie Foxx and Ray  would be the role  I think so  I'd like to see  Alan Alda wins  for supporting  because I love him  so much  how about Don Cheadle  Hotel Rwanda  I didn't see it  I heard he was great  I heard he was  really good in that  why do we have to  play the race card 
[03:06:00]  with the Oscars  this is one instance  where I think  black people complain  and have a legitimate  complaint  really  yeah man  when you look at  the history of the Oscars  when Poitier won for  I think it was  Lily's of the Field  and then he was nominated  he didn't get nominated  in The Heat of the Night  or Guest Was Coming to Dinner  neither one of those films  but is that racial  I know a lot of white actors  that are not nominated  for roles  where you're like  oh he got screwed  or he doesn't win  and you're like  come on that's bull  it has nothing to do  I don't think it has  anything to do with race  I would agree with that  if it was something  that happened occasionally  but there's been  such an overwhelm 
[03:06:30]  sometimes when there's  so much overwhelming  evidence in one direction  you gotta go  it's happening  way too many times  for it to just be like  like if it was  fairly  you know  even  then you're alright  but it's not  I don't know about that  how did Denzel  not win for X  I mean  when you look at  they've made a million mistakes  how did Raging Bull  not win best picture  or best director  I mean  it's a million of them  but blacks I think  do have a very legitimate  complaint with that  alright  wanna get to the important  nominees Anthony  oh of course  up for film editing 
[03:07:00]  why is this even a category  film editing  and then when they win  and go up there  and give a big long speech  like anyone cares  it's like dude  you splice scenes together  stop  I have so many people  to thank  you know  when we sit in there  and cut this film  film editing  I mean  can you tell the difference  between one edited film  and another  you know  it started with  the director's dream  and when we sat there  for hours 
[03:07:30]  cutting this movie  it started with  a razor blade  before we went  to computers  I gotta thank the actors  for doing so many  awful scenes  that I had a lot  to chop out  and Frank  you with the broom  those stuff  that would still be  on the floor  if it was up to me  but you know  I gotta thank him  he swept  and kept the floor clean  so I could drop  more crap onto it  film editing  who are you kidding  another very important  nomination Anthony  make up  make up  very important 
[03:08:00]  usually goes to  the period piece  right  the passion of the Christ  is nominated for makeup  the sea inside  throw some more blood on them  yeah  and lemony snickets  a series of unfortunate events  the passion of the Christ  loses to lemony snickets  that really is depressing  wait  are you telling me  the passion is not  nominated for anything  wow  look at that  I don't know  we're just focusing on  oh I think Hollywood  scorned the passion  gee  what a shock  and they threw him a bone  by giving him a nomination  for best makeup 
[03:08:30]  oh I know  cinematography  okay  that's an important one  where's best picture  we don't care  that's the  who cares  awards  I want to go with the  documentary short subject  Anthony  oh  autism is a world  the children of  Leningradski  hardwood  mighty times  the children's march  sister rose's passion  I'm voting for hardwood  alright well 
[03:09:00]  you get the gag  sound mixing  yeah that's  oh sound mixing  sound mixing  very important  award  very important  they come up  and accept that one  very proud  what a proud moment  alright well  here we go  actor in a leading role  you got Don Cheadle  in Hotel Rwanda  Johnny Depp  in Finding Neverland  what's that movie about  it's about the guy  that wrote  Peter Pan  a whole pedophile 
[03:09:30]  thing going on  in that movie too  yeah  the guy's like  a little too  friendly with children  okay  Leo  Leonardo  Leonardo DiCaprio  for the EVator  he'll probably win that  I wonder where Leo  fits on  Noah's list  of  Hollywood guys  he would  have sex with  probably unattainable  he's like one of those guys  for me it's  Catherine Zeta-Jones  she's so hot  you can't even think of it  I couldn't whack my bag to her  she'll be just the whole time  going  you're fat  and she's hot  forget it  I think Catherine Zeta-Jones 
[03:10:00]  is a choice  that's kind of like  it's that obvious one  that you don't really think it  so you  you say what you think  other people  absolutely  that's what I'm saying  yeah  she's not even in my top ten  no  not at all  she's chubby now  had a few kids  yeah  plus you want a little skank  in your broad  I don't see the skank in her  no  right now it's all about  Scarlett Johansson  she's got some skank to her  she's a little like  odd  she's probably right up there  on everyone's list  okay  Clint Eastwood 
[03:10:30]  a million dollar baby  I saw that movie  he was okay in it  at best  and then Jamie Foxx for Ray  Jamie Foxx should win  I can't comment on the other movies  but I saw Ray  and look  I was thinking like  I'm sick of hearing about Jamie Foxx  and I'm sure they're just promoting him  for whatever  he was so great  that movie  he better work on his acceptance speech then  because that one he gave for  was it the Golden Globe  or the People's Choice  yeah Golden Globes I think  where he starts talking about his grandma  yeah  I want to thank my grandma  sure  oh no  and Bob Kelly'd up the whole stage 
[03:11:00]  it is nice to see an actor be humble though  instead of some of these smug douchebags  and only thank their makeup people  and assistants  yeah Bob  you know best portrayal of a human being  watching a midget  I  really were you crying  when the girl was eating your ass  and going  dirtbag  filthball  you didn't drop a tear then  for her did you  we didn't get to that audio again  we got to get to that audio  oh that's great  alright well actor in a supporting role  you got Alan Alda  was in The Aviator  Alan Alda  they might you know 
[03:11:30]  I think I'm going to give it to him  sometimes they give the award  when they think an actor's getting old enough  where he might not even be nominated  until he dies  so they give him the award  I root for him  I love him  then Thomas Hayden Church  for Sideways  Jamie Foxx in Collateral  Morgan Freeman in Million Dollar Baby  Million Dollar Baby was good  but whatever  and Clive Owen in Closer  there really doesn't seem to be  a real standout movie here  you know  it's not one of those years 
[03:12:00]  where you're like  oh  you know  Cuckoo's Nest  or something  well where is best film  poor dog day afternoon  had to compete with that  oh I know  is that what you were saying earlier  where's best film  best picture  The Aviator  Finding Neverland  Million Dollar Baby again  Ray and Sideways  wow there's not  that one standout movie  you're right  like every other year has  had they not nominated  no passion  maybe it wasn't the best picture  I mean I enjoyed it  but I mean was it that great  I liked it  I thought the makeup was great  but was it a great movie  I don't know  what was the best film you saw this year  Anthony  this year  I don't even think I saw one this year 
[03:12:30]  I didn't see  I didn't see any of these  I saw Million Dollar Baby  I didn't see one movie on this list  I saw  I thought  The Incredibles was  probably my favorite movie  but I haven't seen  oh no  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  was pretty many cool  yeah I liked that a lot actually  I didn't see anything  music score  The Village is in there  Jimmy  no it's not  was it good music  yeah  what music did they play  music score  I don't know  the music was pretty good in that  how about Ray 
[03:13:00]  that had a pretty good score to it  where's this  alright  actress in a leading role  Anthony  no nomination for Ray  in music score  yeah but that was probably just  maybe because it wasn't  an original  a bunch of rock songs  probably thrown together  okay maybe yeah  yeah it was all his old stuff  actress in a leading role  but I mean other songs as well  probably of the time  actress in a leading role  Annette Bening  and Being Julia  ugh that just sounds awful  that's chick flick  probably right  uh Catalina Sandino  Moreno  for Maria Full of Grace  ugh  another chick flick 
[03:13:30]  no it was about a chick  who was a heroin smuggler  or something  oh yeah  oh alright I'm sorry  the chick that was  mewling dope  which I didn't see  because on my stupid  uh satellite TV  I can't get to  order the pay per view movies  there's something wrong  with it  I don't know  but it's bugging me  I wanted to see it  because it's about  a drug smuggler  huh  Imelda Staunton  for Vera Drake  ugh  Hillary Swank  Hillary Swank  they're going to give it  to Hillary Swank  for Million Dollar Baby  and  it's  she won the  Golden Globe for it 
[03:14:00]  and they're going to  give it to her  just because  ugh  how was it  why  well  should I tell people  there's a spoiler coming  and then I can explain  no  you ruined it  I ruined it  like weeks ago  you ruined it by saying  there's a spoiler  you didn't really ruin it  weeks ago  it's always the actor  that has something  drastically wrong  with them  in these films  that win it every year  right  sure  you know whether you're  you're  you know  retarded  or  you know what I mean  yep  yeah  play a retard  who beats the odds  somehow 
[03:14:30]  you're guaranteed  even by doing anything  like you stop tying  your shoes together  finally  by getting on the bus  yeah  pretty much it  the music swells  as you proudly  walk on the bus  your family  buries their  set in the hand  you embarrassment  set in the hand  should I say that  did I say the set  yeah  buries the set in the hand  set in the hand  is worth two in the bush  it's worth  booing the tush  I'm sorry  I bribe at dust  playing a retard  is probably  the easiest thing 
[03:15:00]  to do  sure  we do it  every day  here on this program  where were we  oh yeah  hillary swank  for a million dollar  baby  she's gonna win  that hands down  kate winslet  eternal sunshine  of the spotless mind  she was great  in that film  best puking  with nine toes  someone brings up  a good point  on the phone  spider-man 2  where's spider  spider-man 2  is an amazing movie  how about effects  or something  it's in dominated  for something  is it  where  it is in there 
[03:15:30]  for  something stupid  sound editing  wow  sound editing  there's another  very important category  will it be  the incredibles  the polar express  or spider-man 2  for best sound editing  visual effects too  and sound mixing  visual effects  visual effects  yeah special effects  three crappy movies  in there  harry potter  i robot  and spider-man 2  yeah  and then actress  in a supporting role  you got cate blanchett  for the aviator  laura linney  for kinsey  virginia madsen  for sideways  sophie okanito 
[03:16:00]  for hotel rwanda  and natalie portman  in closer  who cares  yep  and then animated  feature film  some people eat  this stuff up  it's a new category  because there's all  these animated films  every year  it's going to be  between the incredibles  shark tale  or shrek 2  that's pretty much it  why did you say cartoon  because that's what it is  I hate the animated  it gives it  animated feature  it's a cartoon  yeah  art direction  what's that  like sets  I think so  or is that set design  because they have  costume design 
[03:16:30]  what movie had the  best costume this year  is it a period piece  it always goes to  a period piece  a period piece  like grandma  in the outhouse  it'll be  it'll be troy  obviously  you think  it can't be the aviator  you just dig up  some old clothes  from when  howard hughes  was alive  you really gotta go  back  how creative is that  right  finding neverland  lemon  lemony snickets  a series of  unfortunate events  I might have to  watch that movie now  another jim carrey movie 
[03:17:00]  with his wacky names  these films are all  I don't go to movies  that the name is too long  that's the jim carrey film  you're right  I don't like going to movies  where the name is that long  I don't like to  hey what'd you see last night  oh I saw lemony  forget it  I don't even want to say it  yeah  alright that's about it right  is there anything else  to look at here  you're just being too cute  with the long names  eternal sunshine  of the spotless  what  that's why I like Ray  Ray  it's just Ray  that's the whole thing  you can write it on your finger  with a pen if you need to  yeah we gotta play  what I think should be 
[03:17:30]  win best song  yes  America  F yeah  oh yeah  is that nominated  of course not right  no we'll play that  going into break  it was very funny  but first we gotta  by the way I don't mean to interrupt  but I want to congratulate  our own Ben Sparks  for winning the award  for haircut most resembling  Indonesia  they're still plucking  survivors from his hair  today  Matt and Trey actually  were nominated for an Oscar  for their movie 
[03:18:00]  the first movie they put out  one of the songs  and then Phil Collins  wound up winning  that year  how do you lose to Phil Collins  yeah the South Park movie  oh the South Park movie  oh Canada right  Canada  blame Canada  blame Canada  and they wouldn't let  didn't someone else  have to sing it  yeah there was some kind  of thing that went on  but then after they lost  they animated Phil Collins  in the next episode  of South Park  and just made him out  to be a real douche  which was pretty funny  why couldn't he sing  at the Oscars  I don't remember the story  somebody was going to sing  blame Canada 
[03:18:30]  and  they either wouldn't let it be  sung or there was some kind  of controversy  controversy  I don't know  I can't pull this stuff  out of my head  every day  I'll have to do  some research now  Chrissy what's up  hey what's up  we're talking to Chrissy  Valentin  she was kicked off  the Sports Illustrated  swimsuit TV show  right  I heard a pretty girl voice  I thought a wrong number  it's all guys  it's all guys  that call this show  your date of birth  is unknown  huh 
[03:19:00]  it says date of birth  unknown  my date of birth  really  she's 23  you're 23  you know what guys  I can barely hear you  oh no  I see  is this better  I can hear you now  that's good  see it's a girl  you're from  you're from  Little Rock Arkansas  yes  ooh  and  and you got kicked off  the show  I'm really surprised  you called the program  because the last model  had a problem with us  I found out  just before you called in  and we were  really what happened  we were just having fun 
[03:19:30]  with her  we noticed that she had  a really weird  small  toe  like her pinky toe  was a little too small  for our taste  and we kind of  focused on that  for the whole interview  and she got really upset  oh my god  who was it  I don't know  it was the last girl  that got kicked off  she's in Puerto Rico  right now I think  yeah  yeah  I said she was hot  I said  but I did tell her  at the time  that Chrissy was hotter  yes  and all your toes  look very uniform  in this photo 
[03:20:00]  I'm looking at  so you  you have nothing to worry about  oh no don't look at my feet  they're horrible  no no they're better  than the other girls  what do you think  is wrong with your feet  oh god  I don't know  where to begin  I got grocery store feet  what is grocery store feet  you've never heard that before  no  it's hilarious  you know like  when you're pushing a buggy  and you like  hit somebody's  like  back of their foot  or something  and it makes a mark  alright  or anything  like banged up feet 
[03:20:30]  just banged up feet  walking around  in the Little Rock  grocery stores  I need to get my toenails done  so bad  kind of like a heavy  bald diabetic  just messed up  feet missing a toe  here and there  oh god  maybe  she sounds so hot  I love that voice  look at the picture  look at the picture  while she's talking  yeah Chrissy  you're so much hotter  than last week's girl  they brought us  why did they throw you off  I don't know  did they give you a reason  because I'm the mediator  like  you know 
[03:21:00]  I don't really  like  I don't really know  I had a blast  can I tell you something  can I tell you something  I've been telling every girl this  I don't really get this show  because  it's to get into  Sports Illustrated  their swimsuit issue  so aren't they just  basically looking for  the hottest girl  why do you have to have  a good personality  and get along with others  and do well  in stupid  like survivor type contests  it's all about  how hot you look  when they take your photo  right  very true  I'm confused  as far as  professionally  they want somebody 
[03:21:30]  who's good  all around  like  with a good personality  and  that looks good too  because  in order to  work well with others  you have to have  a good personality  you have to be  a negotiator  I mean  that's what I think  I think as a model  I think it's important  to be able to work  with others  Chrissy  when I get to  Sports Illustrated  swimsuit issue  every year  and I'm  whacking it  to the girls in it  I'm not thinking  they have a good personality  I'm thinking 
[03:22:00]  wow  look how hot  she is  yeah  but  I mean  there's men  and women  I mean  this is like  the most popular  magazine in the world  and  men  and women  look at this  equally  I think  actually more women  look at this  than men  really  so  how tall are you  I'm 5'8  5'8  5'8  look at the picture  of her on the front  with the abs  and stuff  do you have to work hard  or are you one of those  natural DNA  kind of 
[03:22:30]  gave you a nice body  kind of thing  I wish I could say  that I was  I mean  natural  or whatever  I don't know  like I used to weigh  like about  150 pounds  a couple years ago  you used to weigh  150 pounds  I used to  because I  I don't know  I ate a whole lot  back then  like a  bunch of double  peppers with cheese  and stuff like that  so how did you  lose all the weight  a lot of puking  or  a lot 
[03:23:00]  a lot of puking  no no no  Tommy Morrison  no I do a lot  of cardio  cardio  and cross training  and  blonde  what color are eyes  I'm thinking  even though  this is a black  and white photo  I'm thinking  green eyes today  what  what color are your eyes  blue  blue eyes  blonde blue eyes  Anthony  very nice  is your  is your body  are your body parts  all yours  or have they been  enhanced by any  types of surgery  oh no she had  implants 
[03:23:30]  well I got  breast implants  you did  what size are those  they're  the C's  C's  that's good  you didn't go huge  small C's  Anthony  they're round  that's nice  what were you  little A cup  before  pretty much  but it didn't really  like it wasn't  like a  like a big deal  to me  I didn't really  care if I had  them or not  but  I mean I figured  it would be a good  time to get them  if I wanted to get them  yeah if you're  going to model  you might as well  have them  well I guess 
[03:24:00]  it's different  with each girl  like me  I wish my hips  were a little bigger  so it would be  a little bit  more proportional  not saying that  my boobs are  big or anything  but I'm  kind of broad  you know  kind of like  a linebacker  it doesn't look  like that in this  oh you got  the wide shoulders  huh  I think you  look terrific  I was just  commenting to the  guys before  I'm looking at  the picture  and I'm just  like yeah she  really looks  terrific  and they all  agreed  well I can't  hardly hear you  we keep on 
[03:24:30]  cutting out  are you on  a cell phone  Angel  yeah  hey Chrissy  so what is  your worst  feature then  if you had  to say  I don't know  y'all tell me  because you're  a hot piece  of ass  well we said  it last time  to the last  girl and she  got mad  and told on  us and I  don't know  I promise  I won't get  mad  I don't see  anything bad  about her though  I can't find  one thing I  would pick out  as a fall  yeah I'm not  known for getting  picky  I think  you're  yeah I think  you're a piece  of ass  I really do 
[03:25:00]  lovely  what's your  what is your  worst feature  if you had  to say  I guess  I'd have  to say  like  my hands  maybe  and like  my butt  and my stomach  what's wrong  with your  hiney  my butt  I just don't  have a butt  I want a hip  and a butt  alright  because I was  telling the guys  before the show  like your stomach  I said to the  guys  I'm like  her abs  are amazing  and they're  like yeah  guys 
[03:25:30]  I mean  it's like  so weird  because  before  I started  working out  and stuff  I didn't think  I had any  abs and stuff  but then whenever  a couple years ago  when I started  working out  like they  kind of came through  but now  I haven't worked  out in so long  like really  really worked  out  I think  cardio  hey  are you a  smart broad  well I don't  know  you going to  school  I try really 
[03:26:00]  hard  you know  did you go  to school  yeah  yeah  I went to  the University  of Arkansas  Monticello  and studied  communication  and my  honors art  University of  Arkansas has  got to be  like 13th  grade though  right  like what  13th grade  that's not  like a real  college  right  I don't know  man  because it's  Arkansas  I don't  I  Chris  I gotta  defend Chrissy  here  because I  was talking  to somebody  about the  University of  Arkansas  about the  communications  program is  supposedly very  good  because I  asked them  I'm like  is that a 
[03:26:30]  good program  and they  went sure  is  yeah  so what  are you  what do  you plan  on doing  now that  they threw  you off  the show  well I'm  here in  Los Angeles  and I  am working  right now  and just  doing different  things  you know  Yoshi  you know  modeling  or I  don't know  whatever  are you  going to  use that  communications  education  for anything 
[03:27:00]  absolutely  I'm going to  start on my  master's degree  probably  let's say  you strike out  in LA  as far as  you know  trying to  get a little  exposure out of  this TV show  thing right  would you  consider  any type  of pornography  what  what  would you  say  hang on  would you  consider  doing porno  if like  all else  fails  while you're  out in  Hollywood  oh I  couldn't  I couldn't  do it  I mean  I give  total props  to the people  in the porn  industry  but me 
[03:27:30]  personally  I mean  I  I just  I'm not  I wouldn't  how about this  how about this  in bed  so I don't  think I'd  be  with that  anyway  Chrissy  if you had  to go  back to  Arkansas  and be  a waitress  or stay  in Hollywood  and become  a huge  porn star  which would  you do  um  like I said  I guess  I would  go back  to Arkansas  would you  really  absolutely  you wouldn't  even  do  you wouldn't  do any type  of like  scat films  or anything  it's what  scat 
[03:28:00]  it's a form  of uh  I don't know  what you say  I don't know  it's one of  those type  of porno  movies or something  Kay from California  wants to say  her worst feature  is her IQ  Kay  come on  that's awful  alright listen  um  Chrissy  very nice  speaking with you  I'm sorry  that you didn't  go any further  best of luck  I guess the girls  that are  that are  still with the show  are a little hotter  unfortunately  I don't  I don't believe  that for a second  I think she's  like a nine and a half 
[03:28:30]  but I guess  there's some tens  still left on the program  nope  it's rigged  do you have a website  miss do you  Chrissy do you have  a website  well um  there's one  I mean it's up  and coming  they're working  on it right now  probably as we speak  so I'm um  I can email you  some more pictures  yeah we'd love to see  more pictures  do that please  absolutely  hang on  let me get a p.m.  because those aren't  good pictures of me  alright  some of them are okay  but that's not  I mean  most of the time

[03:32:00]  on New York  one the news  they had the big  picture of  the Hot 97  article  in the newspaper  it's just  it's getting  some steam  behind it  I think we'll see  someone get fired  from that  debacle  the Hot 97  thing  oh I'm sorry  I wasn't listening  yeah they just  showed it on the news  okay yeah well  we started the show  with that  it's a so  fire defense  we know that now  can't make fun  of the tsunami  hey we gotta say  hi to Benji man 
[03:32:30]  Benji Madden  from Good Charlotte  what's up Benji  oh no I'm sorry  this is still Chrissy  Chrissy  you're hot  because I've been  rethinking the whole  porn thing  I think I'll give it  a chance  yeah you're gonna  try that out  with that hot body  of yours  yeah  yeah she's  she's gonna go  she's gonna leave  Hollywood to become  a waitress in Arkansas  instead of do some  porn  no she'll either  do porn  or she'll start  dating you know  a guy in a rock band  and he'll pay for her  for everything 
[03:33:00]  her way  you see  I was listening  to that whole thing  I just  I didn't know  who it was  but who was that  where was she from  you know that  there's that show  they're trying to find  the latest swimsuit  like model  Sports Illustrated  swimsuit thing  where they got  a bunch of models  so they're trying to  get a quote  a regular girl  in the issue  so they have this  it's another  survivor type show  that was great  that was entertaining  every week  they're gonna vote  someone off  and they're trying  to claim  that they need  personality  and work better  with others 
[03:33:30]  and stuff  and I'm telling  every girl  that calls  every week  I'm like  dude  they're just  looking for  the hottest girl  and you're just  not it  you fell short  you know  you gotta be honest  with them  you fell short  you know  what you gotta do  the skinnier they are  the fatter you tell  them they are  yeah  and just really  give them  that's what I do too  severe eating disorder  put them in a hotel  on a really high floor  like you know  like girls  they say  like  you know  they say  I need to lose  a couple pounds  you know  they're kind of  like waiting to see  if you'll tell them 
[03:34:00]  no you're too skinny  already  and you just go  yeah  you know  it's good  that you can see that  that's good  Benji  last week  we had this girl  she was so hot  but we noticed  she had a really  stubby little toe  so that's all  we focused on  for the whole interview  and she got so  self-conscious  and really  she lost her mind  she just  she didn't know  what to say  and she was taking  it all seriously  and stuff  it's funny  because they all  have one thing  that they focus on  and all you gotta do  is poke it  yeah  keep picking  keep picking at it 
[03:34:30]  yeah man  so what's up with you  I'm in London right now  wow  and we're doing  we're just doing  some press  and some like  TV shows and stuff  and jam with the stones  that's right  Mick Jagger's  in my hotel room  right now  shagging  yeah  Chrissy  good  yeah no  it's pretty cool man  we're just hanging out  we're actually  we're flying to Germany  tonight  and then we're doing  we're starting  in a few days 
[03:35:00]  we're starting  a tour of Asia  and Australia  and New Zealand  wow  how the hell is that  Europe crowd  are they crazy  the food isn't very good  no  but you know  it's for the kids  they like  there's a lot of  angst over here  really  yeah  so like  when we play shows  it's like  you know  in America  you'll play a show  you know  if there's like  if the crowd  if there's like  6,000 people  there's like  one little section  in the middle  that's like a mosh pit  yeah  and here  the whole crowd  they just kill each other 
[03:35:30]  the whole time  all the way to the back  so  that's classic  I'd love to see that  a bunch of Europeans  just slaughtering each other  we were talking the other day  about bands in general  and how some of these bands  they go overseas  and for some reason  they're just absolutely huge  in some weird place  that you would never expect  do you have that going on  with Good Charlotte?  um  well  we're big everywhere  no  no  no  I don't  you know  there's definitely  some countries  where we still play  like to  like a thousand people  yeah  and then there's some  like you know  we're about to go to Japan 
[03:36:00]  and play a show  for like  you know  20,000  so  like  they're starved  for anything over there  man  yeah  like anything American  they like  really love  like jackets  and  you ever see footage  of like  their bands  and stuff  and their  entertainers  it's awful  you can't even  picture sitting  in a room  and watching this  for  a couple hours  oh dude  I spend a lot of time  in Japan  and it's like  it's like  it's a completely  different  it's a different  like  planet man 
[03:36:30]  yeah  do they stand up  during the concerts  years ago  they used to just  sit there politely  and watch bands  do they get up  or no  yeah  they stand up now  and during  during every song  the whole crowd  like has their fist  in the air  and they just go  hey  hey  right  and then  in between the songs  complete silence  really  seriously  it's like  that's great  silent  that you  you really could hear  like if you drop  the coin on stage  yeah  like you could hear  it really  like it's  so weird  that is so strange 
[03:37:00]  every move  and waiting for you  to talk  we're never gonna  figure out their culture  no  we'll eat their sushi  that's about it man  yeah  it's a nice culture  though  it's just weird though  it is weird  you're right  they just think  so differently than us  so what's the first thing  you're gonna do  when you go to Japan  is there anything  you like doing there  actually  I  I think  when we get there  my  actually my girlfriend  is a Japanese  actress  model  okay 
[03:37:30]  so  when we get there  her  I'm gonna see her  her brother  her brother's  wife  just had a baby  really  so that's  family stuff  that's not exciting  or anything  for you guys  you gotta do  family stuff  in Japan  yeah  so  no actually  when I get there  I'm going to  get some hookers  and get wasted  there you go  good boy  of course you are  did you really  have a  did you meet her there  uh yeah  yeah  wow  how the hell  do you  how do you hook up 
[03:38:00]  with a girl in Japan  we were just talking  about how alien that is  yeah but she's not  really  she grew up in America  oh yeah  yeah so  that's how we met  I was like  oh you speak English  yeah  that was the only  prerequisite  yeah  that was it  it's the only thing  I require  oh you're beautiful  and you speak English  there you go  come with me  is there a big  language barrier  or do most of them  speak English  most everyone  in the world  speaks English  damn right  you know  that's our language  yeah we're converting 
[03:38:30]  everyone  even though most people  in our country  can barely speak English  yeah  and I'm not talking  about immigrants  I'm talking about  you know  the people  you know  the everyday Americans  it's funny  like you like  you sit around  with your friends  and some guy  comes up  and he's like  you know  he's got a heavy accent  but he's definitely  getting around  in America  and everyone's like  man he's an idiot  why didn't he learn  how to speak English  you're like  you know  you don't talk  good  yeah  how is Europe 
[03:39:00]  though  you find you're  the ugly American  do they give you  crap because you're  American  and we're hated  around the world  not  you know  I don't think  it's as bad  as everyone thinks  you know  yeah  I mean  but then again  I'm in a rock band  touring around the world  that's true  no one hates a rock band  well  some people do  but you know  we always know why  it's not because  we're Americans  it's because we're rude  yeah  so  yeah  so it's not that  you know  maybe we don't get  an honest opinion  of what it's like 
[03:39:30]  you know  because people are  either really nice to us  or really rude to us  so  you have people  be rude to you  oh yeah  like you know  if you try to go  to a nice restaurant  like there's not  there's not as many  tattoos over there  and stuff  and  and  I guess they don't  really get it  you know  and they don't  think it's cool  and they think  it's disgusting  and  they think it's  American  so you know  some people are rude  but most people  are nice  I think they think  it's American  and that's why  they don't like it 
[03:40:00]  it is  maybe that's it  maybe they think  it's American  alright  hey Benji  we're running out  of show  unfortunately  I know  you got a call  earlier  we'll have to  have you on again  yeah  well I'm gonna  I gotta  I wanna just  call and just  be put on hold  so I can just  listen to these  girls that you guys  have talking  I know  she was supposed  to call earlier  and then we were  supposed to talk  to you  and it got all  messed up  what do you want  to promote today  bro  well let's see  you got the new  single out  I just want to live  right  I just want to live  off the chronicle  of life and death  madeclothing.com
