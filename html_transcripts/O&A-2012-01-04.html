<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous discussion about the Iowa caucuses, focusing on Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum.  The hosts joked about Paul and Santorum's beliefs, imagining them as proponents of a creationist worldview where dinosaurs coexisted with Jesus. This led to a debate about creationism versus evolution and the age of the Earth, punctuated by audio clips from Paul and Newt Gingrich's caucus speeches. The segment continued with a review of memorable political gaffes, including clips and commentary on Howard Dean's scream, Mike Dukakis's tank photo, John Kerry's "reporting for duty" moment, and brief mentions of Rick Perry and Herman Cain.  A tangent on Dr. Steve’s tweets about a meteor shower shifted the conversation to the vastness of space, the insignificance of humanity, the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and the speed of neutrinos, with Dr. Steve participating via phone.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of overrated bands (R.E.M. and Black Sabbath) and "Rock Wars," concluding this segment with musical banter and personal preferences.

The next segment started with a discussion about Jack Nicholson's aversion to television, contrasted with the rise of high-quality programming on HBO and Showtime. This segued into another "Rock Wars" segment comparing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, and Metallica and Megadeth.  The hosts then previewed their upcoming guests: Robert Kelly, Chris Kyle, Donald Trump Jr., and either Michael or Marco Andretti.  The impressive kill count of Chris Kyle was discussed, along with speculation about the nature of his kills and the morality of his actions.  The conversation then took a morbid turn, focusing on the death of Patrice O'Neal, including the anecdote of his Haitian roommate, Will, opening Patrice's coffin at his funeral.  This led to discussions of Dane Cook's jokes about his parents' deaths and the morbid fascination with deceased MySpace pages and their final posts. A bizarre call from a trucker proposing to advertise the show on his semi-truck followed.  The segment concluded with Bob Kelly promoting his show at the Wilbur Theater and Chris Kyle discussing his book, *American Sniper*, his experiences as a Navy SEAL sniper, including his first kill and the ethical dilemmas faced by snipers, SEAL training, the Barrett .50 caliber rifle, and a bar fight with Jesse Ventura.

The following segment heavily featured Chris Kyle, who recounted punching Jesse Ventura at a SEAL's wake after Ventura's alleged derogatory comments about SEALs.  Kyle detailed the altercation and his escape.  The conversation then focused on Kyle's experiences as a sniper in Iraq, his pre-military life as a cowboy, the transition back to civilian life, the realism of sniper depictions in films, the realities of long waits during missions, the emotional toll of his service, an instance where he was shot, and the difficulties adjusting to civilian life after combat. He also discussed the differences in camaraderie and language between military and civilian life.  Bobby Kelly then joined the studio, shifting the conversation to his sleepwalking habits, a negative encounter with an MTV executive, and a crude discussion about the buttocks of several celebrities, particularly Cheryl Tiegs.  A clip of Jesse Ventura rambling about HAARP technology and the JFK assassination was played. Donald Trump Jr. then joined the show, and the conversation shifted to fly fishing, his experiences with it, balancing his public and private life, and an upcoming fly fishing trip with the hosts. The segment ended with discussion of the upcoming Celebrity Apprentice, which featured Trump Jr., Clay Aiken, Lisa Lampanelli, and Penn Jillette.

The final segment focused heavily on the upcoming season of Celebrity Apprentice.  The hosts and guests (including Michael Andretti and Donald Trump Jr.) discussed the cast (Dee Snider, Clay Aiken, Lisa Lampanelli, Aubrey O’Day, Arsenio Hall, and Paul Teutul Sr.), anticipating confrontations and contrasting this season with past seasons, particularly Gary Busey's antics. The challenges of 24/7 filming and its toll on celebrities were discussed, with Andrew Dice Clay cited as an example. Michael Andretti shared his experiences, highlighting the competitiveness, diverse personalities, "crazy moments," and the challenges of being out of his comfort zone. The lack of support networks for celebrities was also discussed.  A significant portion delved into political views, particularly regarding the Republican primaries, President Obama's foreign and domestic policies, the use of drones, and Donald Trump Jr.'s political opinions and Twitter persona.  Andretti shared an anecdote about speeding and evading police. The show concluded with promotion for Celebrity Apprentice and the guests’ social media handles. The conversation throughout this segment involved frequent use of vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah! Morning!  What up on me there?  Is that Bobo on hold already?  Or fake Bobo, or faux Bobo, or fucking asshole Bobo?  Dickweed Bobo?  Why don't we call him guy that we won't pick up the phone for?  I recognize his phone number now.  I don't want to recognize Bobo's...  Oh, it's not him?  Never mind. I guess I don't recognize his number. 
[00:00:30]  Morning, everyone.  Good morning, man.  James!  Who'd you caucus for?  Who'd you caucus for?  The tub.  Caucus.  Oh, boy.  Get the tub.  Oh, boy.  Oh, brother.  I would, uh...  If I was caucusing...  Caucusing.  I would have, uh...  I would have caucused...  That's how they're saying it, too, on the news.  Caucusing.  How about you ask people who did they vote for?  Make it easy.  Who did you caucus for?  Who are you caucusing?  I would have, uh... 
[00:01:00]  Caucused for Ron Paul.  Ron Paul.  If it needs to be known.  The great spoiler.  Mitt Romney, uh...  I don't know.  Like I've said many times, he looks like he's gonna have a nervous breakdown at any moment.  Yeah, because Obama looks so stable.  And I...  Well, he does.  I mean, maybe you don't like his policy, but he doesn't look like he's gonna have a nervous breakdown at any moment.  And then Santorum, I think he believes in dinosaurs and stuff.  Like, in the weird way.  Is he the 5,000-year-old dinosaur guy? 
[00:01:30]  I think he's the Jesus dinosaur guy.  Ron Paul, too, I think.  Ron Paul's a Jesus dinosaur guy?  I believe he is, yeah.  But I think he wouldn't impose it on individual states or whatever.  That's what worried me about him.  Ron Paul believes, like, you know, we were riding dinosaurs and stuff?  I believe so.  Some Ron Paul fan may kill me, but I think he does.  Fuck.  Do you know that ad?  No.  That's crazy talk.  You can't caucus for a guy that believes we were riding on dinosaurs.  I wouldn't caucus for that, gentlemen. 
[00:02:00]  I wouldn't caucus for someone that thinks Jesus had a fucking dinosaur as a pet.  Jesus.  These are our choices?  Dino-Jesus.  Guys that believe that we rode dinosaurs?  That's kind of silly.  Come on, now.  When you're at a party and you run into an individual that believes we were riding dinosaurs...  Dinosaurs.  Someone's yelling, no, Jimmy, no.  About Ron Paul?  I guess.  Oh, maybe I'm wrong.  Okay, I remember hearing that and saying it on the air.  Well, the damage has been done, Jimmy.  But somebody said, Twittered me something funny about how Ron wouldn't impose his stuff 
[00:02:30]  on everybody else.  He goes, so if he wants to think that Jesus rode around on a dinosaur, fuck it, let him.  Well, I was like, you know what?  You're right.  What about Santorum?  Because he's right there in the mix.  Does he believe that we rode dinosaurs?  I don't know.  Because that certainly is an individual I can't vote for.  I don't like any of them except Ron Paul.  So it's...  I mean, I'm actually thinking registering just to vote for Ron Paul.  What were these guys doing in school when we were learning about evolution and stuff?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Did they pass?  Well, Ron Paul...  It's pretty obvious how... 
[00:03:00]  We know a lot about the history of Earth.  He's old, though.  A vote for Ron Paul is a vote for Obama.  I don't think so.  Yeah, I think so.  Because he's doing better than people think he is.  No, but you will not get mainstream Republicans to vote for Ron Paul.  It just won't happen.  Jimmy's right.  So you'll divvy up the party.  I don't know.  You'll divvy it up between the conservative Republican mainstay who will vote for the Republican  candidate.  And then if Ron Paul's still in it as an independent, you'll get the people that will vote for him 
[00:03:30]  and it will only divvy up the Republican side and Obama stays in for another four years.  I think he pulls people from Obama, too.  I'm thinking he might pull some from Obama.  Some.  Yeah, radical left.  Radical left.  But I think...  Not as much as splitting the party for...  I think he pulls more from the Republican side.  Yeah.  Maybe like Ross Perot did.  But you know what?  Exactly.  I still want to vote for him because I like him a lot better than I like anybody else.  I don't dislike Obama like you do, but I like Ron Paul more than I like those other 
[00:04:00]  guys.  I'm voting for...  See, people are confused when they ask me who I'm voting for and why and what this...  I'm voting to get Obama out of office.  I'm not voting for any candidate in particular this time around.  I don't particularly like the guys that are running either.  But I have to vote to remove a man that I see is really destroying the country.  Sorry.  All right, but what if it comes down to the guy that believes we rode dinosaurs? 
[00:04:30]  You still vote for him?  Fucking giddy up, fucking Dino.  Giddy up.  You can't vote for a guy that thinks we rode dinosaurs.  I don't give a shit.  And we're saying a lot here.  Is that a fact?  Does Santorum believe that?  I don't know.  It makes it hard, though.  And you'll think people can believe what they want, but it makes it hard for me to respect  anybody who really thinks that we rode dinosaurs.  And when you believe that Jesus rode dinosaurs, basically, that means the Earth's the only 
[00:05:00]  what?  6,000 years old or something?  It's my favorite picture.  It's a very holy-looking painting of Jesus, and he's looking lovingly, holding...  Normally, that picture, he's holding a lamb, I do believe.  Yes, that's the famous lamb picture.  But he is holding a baby velociraptor right there in his holy Jesus arms, a velociraptor.  And they never thought that before until science made them look like such assholes.  And they're like, oh yeah, no, they're mentioned in the Bible.  They're not.  Yeah, yeah, sure. 
[00:05:30]  No, they're not.  I think Black Earl believes that crap.  Of course he does.  That the Earth is only...  I think in his case, he believes it's only a couple thousand years old.  A couple thousand years old.  Dinosaurs with Jesus.  I just can't...  You can't talk to people like that.  You can't talk to them.  Scientists are pretty smart.  It was like...  They don't know everything, but they know some shit.  You can go to museums and realize, holy fuck, the Earth is pretty damn old.  Jesus had a baby, a stegosaurus, as a lawnmower.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  That's a living. 
[00:06:00]  That's a living.  I just think you're kind of an asshole.  Paul, if you believe a book that was a bunch of great stories that were collected together  300 years after Christ died, if you believe that over all scientific evidence, I think  you're a dope.  I think you're a kook.  Exactly.  Well, well.  But other people, you know...  And they'll call it scientific evidence.  All right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  No, no.  The scientist doesn't really say that... 
[00:06:30]  Carbon dating isn't as accurate as...  Yeah, well, that's why they came up with other means of dating things.  They're not off by billions.  Yeah.  Believe me, I'm not into carbon dating either.  See?  Get it?  I do.  I do.  Get what I did there?  Yes.  Bombed.  Of course it did.  We got some caucus speeches.  Caucus speeches?  Well, actually, just two that are worth playing.  How's your caucus?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got the third place finisher, Ron Paul. 
[00:07:00]  I thought he was supposed to win this damn thing.  Well...  Aren't these only registered Republicans that are in the caucus right now?  I guess.  Well, yeah, yeah.  They're not Democrats?  No.  Who are unhappy with Obama?  No, no.  I just don't like Des Moines' attitude right now.  All eyes are on Des Moines, and they're acting a little fucking snobby.  It really means nothing.  This means nothing.  Really?  They have all kinds of these things all over the country.  Then why do we always focus on Iowa?  Because it's the first one. 
[00:07:30]  So it's the indicator.  Those people think it's the most important thing ever.  Of course they do.  Why do we focus on Iowa?  Why is it Iowa?  Because it's the first one.  It's the first caucus.  It sets the tone.  After all this just media crap that's been going on.  I'm a fan of, it sets the tone.  Oh, it sets the tone.  I like when they go, as goes Iowa, goes the election.  Yeah, goes the nation.  No, it doesn't.  Santorum advocates creationism being discussed in schools. 
[00:08:00]  All right.  Let's discuss.  Why don't they stop it?  What does that mean, though?  That's pretty vague.  That a being created us, that we were created by intelligent design.  And he wants it in school as they teach, you know.  Well, it's like God stuff, right?  Yeah.  He wants some God stuff.  They want to teach God stuff instead of just bones stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do not agree with that.  I think it all could be connected.  I don't know if we have figured it out yet.  Maybe. 
[00:08:30]  But, you know, to think that Jesus was around with dinosaurs is ridiculous.  That is kind of crazy.  Here's Ron Paul, third place finisher.  So tonight we have come out of an election.  And we're essentially three winners, three top vote getters.  And we will go on.  We will raise the money.  I have no doubt about the volunteers.  They're going to be there.  I think there's nothing to be ashamed of.  Everything to be satisfied. 
[00:09:00]  And be ready and raring to move on.  On to the next stop, which is New Hampshire.  Wow.  He sounds like an old stoner.  Yeah.  And wing on over.  Wing on over to London and jab with the stones.  Sounds like an old Spicoli.  Where'd you get that jacket?  You hear that?  He's got a little old Spicoli in his mouth.  But he's different than these other two douches.  Can we just hear Howard Dean there?  Pop that up.  I'll hear Howard Dean.  Howard Dean as well.  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  This is from how many years ago?  Oh, man.  2008, I guess, right?  Before that, isn't it?  Yeah.  Wow.  Before, I think.  2006?  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Team for America dot com.  What's there now?  Yeah, this is Iowa, right?  Yeah.  Come on.  Talk.  And then we're going to. 
[00:10:00]  What are you doing?  Where are you going, Howard?  Howard?  Well.  Well.  You guys, you have already got the picture here.  I was about to say, you know, I'm sure there's some disappointed people here.  You know what?  You know something?  You know something?  If you had told us one year ago that we were going to come in third in Iowa, we would have  given anything for that.  And you know something? 
[00:10:30]  You know something?  Not only are we going to New Hampshire, Tom Harkin, we're going to South Carolina and  Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico.  We're going to California and Texas and New York.  We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan.  And then we're going to Washington, D.C. to take back the White House.  Yeah!  And that was the end of his political career.  Do you think that moment ruined him, didn't it? 
[00:11:00]  That was it.  Right there was it for him.  Wow.  But I like excitement like that.  Oh, yeah.  Who wouldn't?  That's the 2004 election, obviously.  But then, all right, the video was posted in 2006.  Gotcha.  What happened?  Yeah.  Well, you're like, that could ruin, like, Mike Dukakis' helmet.  Yeah, the tank helmet.  I think it's usually a Democrat being ruined in a moment like that.  I just haven't seen that many Republicans.  We have the tank helmet photo killed him.  Oh, it looks so silly.  And there was another one I'm thinking.  It looks like a bobblehead doll.  Oh, he looks like such a clown.  Which is ridiculous.  Oh, reporting for duty ruined Johnny Kephler. 
[00:11:30]  Reporting for duty.  Really, are you?  Do you have that?  John Kerry?  John Kerry reporting for duty.  Let's see that.  Oh, my dudes.  He's a great election full pause that have just fucked up their career.  John Kerry reporting for duty.  Also, Brad is saying supposedly half the country believes Earth is 6,000 years old.  Not good for half the country.  Half the country believes that?  I don't believe it's that much.  But maybe he's right.  He might be right.  Why couldn't I go to school with those guys?  I would have been a fucking A-plus student. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Where are those dummies living?  Where the fuck?  Half the...  Well, I believe in the middle of the country somewhere.  You think we're talking to those people right now?  Yeah.  Fuck, we need you.  There's some people.  We need you to keep this massive audience going.  There's some people.  Reporting for duty.  Where is the reporting for duty?  What was another one?  I'm thinking of Howard Dean.  I mean, I was thinking of Howard Dean.  But I know Mike Dukakis' helmet shot.  He looked like such a clown.  Well, I mean, Rick Perry very recently, obviously, had some faux pas. 
[00:12:30]  Herman Cain.  Herman Cain.  Whoopsie.  This has been a good year for them looking like assholes.  For some whoopsies.  Can't find reporting for duty.  No new taxes, I'm thinking.  Which was Republican?  Read my lips.  Yeah.  No new taxes.  I defended this country as a young man.  When we were ashamed of and hated what we were called on to do in Southeast Asia.  The country doesn't know it yet.  But it's created a monster.  A monster.  A monster in the form of millions of men who have been taught to deal and to trade in violence. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  And who are given the chance to die for the biggest nothing in history.  Yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed  in that I took part in shootings in free fire zones.  I conducted harassment in interdiction fire.  I used .50 caliber machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were  our only weapon against people.  I took part in search of destroyations in the burning of villages. 
[00:13:30]  I'm John Kerry.  Torch this place!  And I'm reporting for duty.  Oh, that was it.  Oh, God.  Who thought he was going to have such a moment there?  That was going to be a huge moment.  Let's hear that again.  And let's hear what happens after.  I'm John Kerry.  Oh, don't say it.  And I'm reporting for duty.  You are dismissed, Mr. Kerry. 
[00:14:00]  How embarrassing.  And I'm.  Here it comes, folks.  He paused.  Reporting.  And the brother enthusiasm.  Oh, he's a dude.  Yeah.  Reporting for duty.  Oh, he's a dude.  He is D-O-O-D-I.  We should have made a duty hat for him, Mr. Kerry.  Oh, boy.  I'm reporting for duty.  I'm John Kerry, and big boy made a duty. 
[00:14:30]  Fuck.  What a boob.  He is an oaf.  And finally, the only other clip we got really from the caucus that's worth playing for you  people is the Newt Gingrich clip.  Newt has now decided he's going to just attack Mitt Romney.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, man.  He didn't finish in the top three, huh?  Ooh, fourth place.  No, he got right out of dodge.  That was it.  He peaked a bit early.  Good.  He's another tool. 
[00:15:00]  Huh?  He's another tool.  They all are.  Don't like his big round head.  Right across the fucking board.  They're all fucking tools.  Both sides.  Here's Newt.  This will be a major debate with Congressman Paul, who's had a very good night, and I congratulate  him having done very well.  The fact is, his views on foreign policy, I think, are stunningly dangerous for the survival  of the United States.  We'll have one other great debate, and that is whether this party wants a Reagan conservative 
[00:15:30]  who helped change Washington in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan, and helped change Washington  in the 1990s as Speaker of the House.  And changed my pants.  Somebody who is into changing Washington.  Yes.  Or we want a Massachusetts moderate who, in fact, will be pretty good at managing the  decay, but has given no evidence in his years at Massachusetts of any ability to change  the culture or change the political structure or change the government.  Newt's going to be a problem.  I like that, though.  What he said there, I like it.  Newt's going to be a problem, though. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  And I like the fact they're attacking Ron Paul's foreign policy, because I like his foreign  policy.  Yeah.  He's a little too radical, but he's like, fuck the world.  Paul, he's tired of it, of being a world cop, and I agree with him.  Yeah.  Newt's going to be a problem for Romney.  And he's not the type of guy that's going to back out for the party's sake.  The good of the party.  Yeah.  The party.  Great party.  He's going to be a problem.  Yeah.  Remember Bush vomited on the Japanese prime minister?  Oh, yeah.  Great.  He fainted and puked all over him. 
[00:16:30]  Did he faint there, too?  Yeah.  He, like, went great.  Got all woozy and toppled over and puked on his lap.  Was it the food?  I don't know.  He was just sick, and I guess those guys don't stop when they're not feeling too well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mike Huckabee did win Iowa four years ago.  Did he?  Yeah.  Nothing happened with him, right?  No.  Iowa can shut up.  Yeah.  I love you, Iowa.  Iowa can kiss my ass.  Are they the Buckeye State?  Yeah.  No, that's Ohio.  That's Ohio, yeah.  What are they?  Iowa?  Corncob State? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  I don't know what they are.  They're in the spotlight.  Do you have that picture of Mike Dukakis?  Sam, just look for a Dukakis tank.  Oh, yeah.  We're just looking for a tank.  I think he comes up before the military does.  If you put Dukakis tanked, it's his wife.  Oh.  She was a drunk.  Good old kitty.  That's funny.  She drank, what, nail polish?  Oh, she drank anything.  Listerine.  Whatever.  Oh, look at him with his big, dumb helmet.  The chin strap.  He looks like Feifle. 
[00:17:30]  Like Feifle the mouse.  What a fool he looks like.  You know, when Kennedy was offered, in Dallas, actually, it was the first...  What, that helmet?  He should have wore it.  Now, there's a politician who should have wore the helmet.  He was offered a cowboy hat and a breakfast he had, because he had something in another  town before they got to Dallas, and he refused it.  He goes, they offered it because he never liked to look stupid.  Little did he know what a goose he was going to look like in a half hour, with his head 
[00:18:00]  all the witch away.  But he goes, he didn't like to, because he was so smooth.  Right.  And like, here, Mr. President, he didn't want to insult them, because it was Texas  Yeah.  So he goes, you come to the White House, and I'll put that on.  Oh, yeah.  He kind of dodged it very graciously.  You know who understood that was Clinton.  Clinton knew that you can't look stupid ever.  In a photo, right.  In a photo.  But Dukakis, he was all in.  What a dummy.  If he was in that tank without the helmet, it would have looked way better.  But he's also got, like, you can see his tie and his collar underneath his tank uniform. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  And his stupid chin strap.  And a giant printed label that says Mike Dukakis across the front.  What an idiot.  Oh, no.  Does he?  Hey.  Yeah.  It just looks silly.  Marcos is reminding us about Bob Dole, too.  Let's not forget.  Bob Dole.  When he fell off that fucking railing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Where did he fall?  I don't remember Bob Dole falling.  Oh, yeah.  Bob Dole fell off the stage.  And then the whole country was like, wow, this guy's weak.  Oh. 
[00:19:00]  It looked like he was stage diving, and no one was there.  Oh, look at that.  And he fell on his band.  Is the band still playing?  Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  Bob Dole.  Yeah.  Hi-fi-fi.  He fell on his bad arm, too, so he couldn't get up right away.  He was on his right side.  Yeah.  He did just lay there for about 25 minutes.  Yeah.  He fell right through that railing.  Holding that pen of his.  Nobody liked his right arm.  No.  Who thought it was a good idea to glue a pen in it? 
[00:19:30]  A useless appendage.  Because that looked ridiculous after a while.  Yeah.  We should have played dildo.  Something.  Switch it up every so often.  Something fun.  Put a boxing glove on it.  That'll make you look tough.  What a dolt.  But Howard Dean.  Not Howard Dean.  I really am starting to like Ron Paul more.  He may lose me, but I'm starting to like him a lot more.  Yeah.  In the end, he's not going to get it, Jimmy.  You might be right, but you never know.  Ross Perot did a lot better than people thought.  He got 17%, and he would have done better, but remember he freaked out, 
[00:20:00]  and he thought they were sabotaging his daughter's wedding.  He went nuts at the end, and that hurt him terribly,  but he had a really good shot up until he fucked it up.  I don't think he ever had a shot of actually winning.  No.  I don't know.  Because look who we picked for VP and all that.  That was a stunt.  We just don't have it yet.  We don't have the ability to have a third-party candidate yet.  But Ron Paul is pushing us forward as far as that goes.  17% he got.  He's pushing us a little more forward.  Yeah.  It's going to take a while to maybe be taken very seriously, the third party. 
[00:20:30]  Because it's such a, you were talking about it before,  it's such a money game, you know, and the third-party candidates,  unless they are wealthy like Perot and stuff like that,  but they just don't have that, they can't get a lot of the people on board.  I think you're wrong about Obama guaranteed re-election with Ron Paul,  because people are so unhappy with him.  Conservatives across the board will vote for anybody but him.  They want him gone.  Put it this way, if Ron Paul could beat Obama in an election, 
[00:21:00]  then the Republican candidate would smash Obama.  If he's that vulnerable, that Ron Paul could win.  Because I don't, I just can't see it.  I think a lot of, the difference between him is he won't divide it as much on party lines.  I really think Ron Paul, he pulls a, Joe Rogan's a pretty radically liberal guy.  He's not a conservative.  No.  But he gets that group that are really hardcore liberals.  But you are getting the radical end of the spectrum with Ron Paul. 
[00:21:30]  And you need that base that's kind of just, hey, I like a Republican or a Democrat,  and I'm going to get in there and pull that lever for, you know.  They don't, people don't like that crazy change.  And unfortunately, that's what this country needs, is crazy-ass change.  Not this fake change that Obama promised,  or the other change that the Republicans say they'll bring, which is nothing changing. 
[00:22:00]  No.  What happened to Al Gore?  He was kind of a, he's a smart guy.  Like, oh, you look at the internet.  Remember he was talking about the information superhighway, and you're like, oh, shut up.  He, I don't think, he kooked out with that fucking environmental shit.  I don't think he's a smart guy anymore.  That had a lot to do with that, though.  The global warming thing really made people go like, oh, shut up.  He's very kooky.  And then he didn't want Clinton support.  What an idiot.  You have to see through all that. 
[00:22:30]  The country saw through that and was okay with it in the end.  But he was right about the internet.  I get a credit, I credit Clinton and Gore with not creating it, but with really pushing it.  And that administration was the ones that talked about it.  1999, they were talking about it.  Well, there you have it.  So Romney squeaked by.  Santorum's right behind him, right?  In the caucus vote.  Dual squeaked by Spicoli.  I think he won by six caucuses.  Six caucuses?  Six caucus votes. 
[00:23:00]  Caucuses.  Caucuses.  I need a caucus.  Can we talk about how fucking cold it is in New York?  It is pretty fucking cold.  And I know we have listeners in Minnesota and Detroit and all these really cold places up in Canada.  Oh, I know.  There's people that are looking and going, it's colder here.  Shut up.  All right.  On your little thingy there.  Yeah.  Ask them how cold it is, where they're at.  All right.  What's the temperature there?  We woke up to 11 degrees.  And don't give me no Celsius bullshit, you foreigner. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  You figure out that math.  Don't make us do it.  Let's see.  We woke up, it was 11.  And where me and Jimmy live, we live close to the river.  Wow, dude.  It's 23 in Michigan.  Sorry, we beat you.  Sorry, we beat you.  It's fucking 13 degrees out.  Bobby in Connecticut is getting 8 degrees.  Centiport, 13.  Ohio, 21.  I'm looking for...  Lower than 13.  Legit. 
[00:24:00]  Can I, before we go on, say one more thing about the caucus?  Yes, the caucus.  This is how close it was?  Could you just go first, second, third place?  Six votes.  874 to 908, no, about 30, about 35 votes.  Oh, okay.  Then they updated that.  And Ron Paul was 26,097.  He was only 3,000 behind.  This wacko, quote unquote, was only 3,000 behind.  He's right there with those two guys.  And Gingrich was 10,000 behind him.  But it's very fucking close.  I think he has a shot.  I'm going to keep talking about it.  But they also love him in Iowa.  Rob Paul? 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Individual states, it changes drastically.  They love him in Iowa.  Oh, all right.  That's the Ron Paul country.  Is it?  Well, yeah, he does well there.  We'll see.  What's the next one?  Rick should have fun of those big gums.  What is New Hampshire?  Is that next?  New Hampshire, yes, I think, right?  Vermont?  I get those two.  And when do they pick this thing?  Soon?  I guess after their caucuses.  So we're going to know who the candidate is when?  It should be pretty soon.  How do we not know this shit? 
[00:25:00]  By March, right?  April?  Wait, wait, no.  Probably March, I would assume.  Once they start.  It goes fast now.  Yeah, Super Tuesday is March 6th.  Super Tuesday.  Okay.  You get a lot of caucusing done there.  A lot of primaries and caucusing done there.  Buffalo is 12 degrees.  And New Hampshire supposedly is minus one.  Get the fuck out of here.  What is that?  Windchill?  Don't give me windchill.  It's minus two here.  Windchill.  We don't do Celsius.  Minus two windchill here. 
[00:25:30]  So don't even try to pull your windchill shit.  Can we wake up Dr. Steve?  Oh, boy.  He's tweeting about a meteor shower.  Then he writes me and goes,  Hey, on your way to work, make sure you check out the meteor shower.  I don't even know where to look.  In the sky.  But he doesn't tell me where to look.  No, I know it's in the sky, but do I look to the north, the south, the east, the west?  What time do I look?  Dr. Steve didn't put the proper coordinates.  Is the meteor shower just going to wait for me and decide to start its little show?  What the fuck was he tweeting about last night? 
[00:26:00]  I don't know.  Did you see a meteor shower?  No, it supposedly ended at five.  And what do you see?  Just streaks of light going, you know, shooting stars is all you're seeing.  But a lot of it?  Yeah.  Yeah, a lot of them.  That's what a meteor shower is?  You see a lot of those?  Yeah, you see a lot of shooting stars.  That's pretty much it.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, guess what?  I didn't see no meteor shower and I was looking all over the sky.  He made me look all over the sky this morning.  NASA has a Ustream channel and they were putting up a live video feed of the sky. 
[00:26:30]  Was it cold?  And that little thing.  I didn't see it.  I just heard that it was up.  Oh.  But the Quadrantids, the Quadrantids meteor shower.  What?  Sounds like a monster from Star Trek.  That space shit scares me.  It's too big out there.  It's very big.  Oh, it's very big out there.  I like to think how big it really is.  Oh, it's very big.  I really don't like to think about it.  We're very small. 
[00:27:00]  I don't want to think about that.  We're teeny, tiny little things.  How tiny are we as individuals?  Oh, insignificant.  But are we like a piece of dust?  Or smaller than that?  Really?  Less.  You can see dust.  Sometimes it's significant.  Sometimes it makes you cough.  So in the overall scheme of things...  Nothing.  We're not even a piece of dust?  Zilch.  We need to be a part of a collective that makes a difference. 
[00:27:30]  Is Earth at least a piece of dust?  Oh, that's nothing.  Earth is nothing.  It's not even a piece of dust in the overall scheme of things?  Picture a grain of sand on the biggest beach or the desert, in the Sahara Desert, that is  underneath all the rest of the sand, that will never see the light of day, never get  stepped on by the foot of anyone, never even be near anything that makes a difference.  That's what our entire galaxy is. 
[00:28:00]  Get out of here.  That's what the Milky Way galaxy is.  No, man.  Oh, yeah.  We're just nothing.  So we're pompous as humans thinking we can explore space, right?  We can't explore shit.  Like, it's like...  We can't really get out of our own house.  It's like sitting in the sand, going with your analogy, and just kind of looking around  you, and not exploring the entire rest of the beach.  You can't get to the rest of the beach.  Oh, my God.  Yes, we were all thrilled that we got people to the moon at one point.  Oh, my God.  And that's like nothing.  Oh, we're all going to die. 
[00:28:30]  That's such a short trip.  And no one will ever know we were here.  That's it.  Make your mark now on the internet.  So let's just enjoy the radio show today.  Yeah.  And jerk off later.  Here's Dr. Steve.  Oh.  Steve.  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve?  Fucking nailed it.  And nailed it?  Totally nailed it, yeah.  So we'll never know shit.  No.  There's always going to be so much more to know that we'll never know. 
[00:29:00]  He's talking about our galaxy just being one grain of sand somewhere in the middle of a  beach.  Yeah.  There's as many galaxies in the universe as there are grains of sand on our beaches.  I mean, it's unimaginable how fast.  And, you know, there's a...  So then why do we get these shitty brains?  Why couldn't we get a cooler brain?  Well...  Try to figure it out.  Right. 
[00:29:30]  To understand it so we don't feel so insignificant.  We're standing on the shoulders of our ancestors, and what our ancestors had to do was, you know,  make sure they didn't get eaten by a saber-toothed tiger.  Yeah.  And so, you know, that's the brain that we're given right now, and this is one of the reasons  why people believe in crazy things.  Yeah.  We always wonder why people are so prone to believe crazy things, and it's because there's 
[00:30:00]  an evolutionary advantage to that.  If you were the guy standing in the African savanna, and you saw the grass move in the  distance, and you ran away because you believed every time that it was a saber-toothed tiger  or a tiger or a lion or whatever, then there was a survival advantage in that.  If you were the one that went and said, well, let me analytically check this out and see 
[00:30:30]  if it really is a lion before I run away, then you were probably going to get eaten one  time out of a thousand or whatever.  Yeah.  So that gene for believing, you know, outlandish things was actually a survival mechanism, and  that's why people believe in, you know, outlandish things now, I think.  Yeah.  I think the whole religion thing comes into play, too, because there's just this need  to think that you're more important than you are, and that something needs to be carried 
[00:31:00]  on, that you're so important that the idea that you just won't exist anymore is incomprehensible.  It is incomprehensible.  Yeah.  That's why we're...  You know, every night we go to sleep, we cease to exist, and we're okay with that.  You know, I love what Penn Jillette said when he was on your show recently, that the billions 
[00:31:30]  of years that you weren't here, and the fact that you didn't experience any of that time  at all does not seem to bother people.  That's perfect.  The billions of years after.  Yeah, it's all that after stuff that kind of gets you.  And apparently, you only seem to care about it while you're here.  That's right.  Because no one really seems to care about it enough to come back after they're gone.  Oh, man. 
[00:32:00]  Damn.  Yeah, you can believe that if you want, Dr. Steve.  I'm going to walk with the Lord.  Oh, Chip has found Jesus.  My mother told me that you go to a very special place when you die.  Yeah, where?  Up to heaven.  Oh, yeah?  Where's heaven?  I don't know.  Up in the sky.  Everything's lined with gold.  Everybody's nice to you.  You're a retard.  Dr. Steve, how old is the earth?  6,000 years old?  Yes.  In hours.  Quickly.  Go.  Yeah.  3.7 billion years old. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  3.7 billion?  Well.  Do you think there were a bunch of other civilizations way before us that got completely wiped out  and then we started over?  You mean advanced civilizations like ours?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something kind of similar to us, I guess.  Here's the thing.  I don't think so.  And the reason I don't is because the one thing that an advanced civilization will have, 
[00:33:00]  I mean, it doesn't have to be that advanced is to have ceramics, and ceramics can last  for billions of years when we're gone.  And if some alien civilization comes here after we've been swallowed up by the sun when it  goes into its red, giant face, the one thing that they will find that we leave behind is  ceramics.  Damn.  Even more than metal?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, what happens to metal now?  I mean, look at these junk cars in, you know, some of the less desirable neighborhoods are 
[00:33:30]  already...  Yeah, they rust away, and then they just erode, and then they're gone.  Turn it to dust.  Yeah, but ceramics.  Yeah, isn't that funny?  People just see teacups.  They last longer than anything else we've ever made?  Yes.  Wow.  It does make sense, because a lot of times when they find things, it's some type of  pottery and ceramics.  So that's pretty amazing.  If the Earth is 3.7 billion years old, and this tiny little part of it is, you know, human 
[00:34:00]  civilization, that's pretty fucked up.  Our whole time here has been nothing.  But it's pretty fucked up that, you know, we're an advanced civilization, even though the  Earth's been around for 3.7 billion.  Relatively speaking.  That's why I'm suspicious that there was others before us, because 3.7 billion years,  and finally we pop up?  Well, the Earth wasn't really very inhabitable for a large portion of that. 
[00:34:30]  That's why I believe we came from somewhere else.  We just jumped from planet to planet, away from the sun.  I hope you're right, dude, because here's the thing.  If we fuck up and we destroy ourselves, we've got less than one to two billion years to get  it kick-started again before we can get off this planet, before it truly becomes uninhabitable.  I believe that the only long-term goal we need to have is to get off this planet, because 
[00:35:00]  it's not just asteroids, it's not just the sun that can destroy us, there is a supervolcano.  We know about the supervolcano.  It freaks us all out.  I'll take the volcano.  Under Yosemite supervolcano.  Oh, Yellowstone, right.  Under Yellowstone.  We know about the supervolcano.  We wipe out everybody.  And we know it's due to erupt.  We know all this. 
[00:35:30]  Can I ask you a question, Steve?  Can I ask you a question about the supervolcano?  Is it mild-mannered normally?  Like, do we know which one it is?  Because they're like, hey, why is that volcano wearing glasses?  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That could be the worst.  Oh, my God.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Ah, boo.  Dr. Steve?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Dr. Steve, do you believe that there's other civilizations sort of like ours out in the universe? 
[00:36:00]  I think there has to be.  But it's interesting that we've been searching for them using the search for extraterrestrial intelligence for several years now  and done a pretty, you know, a good start on the survey of the skies and have found absolutely nothing.  Yeah, but let's go back to the beach.  And if we're one grain of sand, how far have we searched? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, not very far.  Not very far because there are a lot of frequencies that we haven't checked yet  and a lot of stars that we haven't given the second look to and, you know, that we haven't gotten very far.  And funding for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence is just about dried up.  So, you know, the large array that they were going to develop now has something like 13 telescopes instead of the 1,300.  I'm getting the numbers wrong, but, you know, there's... 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, we hear you.  Well, why is SETI such...  Like, it's almost like the scientific death.  Why is it if you want to work for SETI, you're considered a quack?  Well, because they haven't had any results yet.  And here's the thing.  The thing is, if they never find anything, then what we have here is unbelievably rare and precious.  And so that's a stunning, incredible result.  If they do find something, then that's the most incredible result that you could imagine. 
[00:37:30]  So, either way, it's going to be an incredible result.  But the problem is the negative just turns people off because they, you know, it's just...  What about the...  It's a negative finding.  What about the collider where they had the...  As you and I have often joked, I've often said, I come faster than a neutrino.  And...  Physics humor. 
[00:38:00]  Now, what about the neutrino?  They said they retested that thousands of times and the tests were held up so far.  They passed the speed of light.  Yeah, the signal...  What it is is they're looking at a cumulative signal over time.  And it keeps coming up that the neutrino is arriving somewhat faster than it would if it obeyed the speed of light.  Now, this is not something that we can use for time travel because, first off,  the neutrino's mass is so small that it doesn't really apply to normal matter. 
[00:38:30]  And it's...  You're talking 60 trillionths of a second that it's arriving faster than it would if it obeyed the speed of light.  But it's only going a short distance, though, right?  Imagine if it was...  It's only going to, what, a couple thousand miles, a few hundred miles?  Right.  But if it was longer than that, it would be even arriving even earlier, you see?  Because, you know, if you multiply the distance, then the amount of time that it would take would be that much, you know, 
[00:39:00]  the interval between the speed of light and the neutrino arriving would be even greater if it was a farther distance.  Sure.  Right, so it would beat the speed of light by even more.  Sure, yeah, we all know that.  So it's incredibly precise that they're able to measure this over such a small distance.  And what that throws in is the possibility for a very small error causing this result. 
[00:39:30]  Dr. Steve, the audience just begging that you put this in some type of cartoon analogy so we can understand.  Yeah, we don't get it.  Ah!  Yeah, let's say you rolled a cookie.  Ah!  Like a cartoony river.  But you see, we understand this, what you're saying.  We don't need it to be cartooned up.  If two giant ants...  What? 
[00:40:00]  What does that mean?  I love cacu.  Yeah, I do too.  I like Dr. Steve better.  All right.  Hey, Dr. Steve, what...  Oh, Steve is better?  Oh, Steve, what's better?  Hey, I like cacu better when cacu gets me Valtrex.  Am I right or wrong, Steve?  But no, he explains things in a way that scientists like myself can understand it.  Yeah.  What do you know about absolute omega?  Rob wants to talk about it on the line, but maybe you just know about it.  What is it?  Absolutely nothing.  What the hell is it?  Language, Steve, please. 
[00:40:30]  All right, hold on a minute.  What are we, gutter?  We might have a new...  That's a new vodka.  It's great.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Rob, go ahead real fast.  Yeah, no, absolute omega.  There's a theoretical physicist that states that the absolute endgame for the human race  is when we explore the entire universe.  This could be millions of years from now, but we explore the entire universe.  We know everything there is to know about the universe and harness all its energy to where  we will eventually bring back every living human that's ever existed on this planet just 
[00:41:00]  because we're curious and they'll never die or cease to exist from that point on.  So he believes that that's like our heaven or that's like when you die, you will be re-resurrected.  That sounds like hokum.  In this reality and live forever.  Oh, well.  Of course, that comes into play because that gets people going like, oh, okay, I'll believe that.  That's scientists who kind of still believe in God but know it's harder to believe in God.  They're like, yeah, how could science work this out?  Yeah, yeah.  I like that.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  Why can't the two be connected in some way, though?  Why not?  Why not?  I was exploring in a book called River World where they brought back every person that  had ever lived.  Oh.  God, that would be a nightmare.  Yeah.  We wouldn't be able to leave this fucking building.  How would we get home?  Oh, crazy traffic.  Just people on top of people.  Traffic and people that don't know how to drive because they rode horses.  Yeah.  Right.  Crazy.  Stop swinging that thing over your head with the spikes on it. 
[00:42:00]  It's over.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Hi-ya!  It's like when I would play one of those games where you've got to upgrade your military  video games.  Yeah.  And then occasionally you hear like a clang, clang, clang, and you've got tanks rolling,  and it's some guy with a sword at the front door of a fort.  And it's like, wait a minute, I've already upgraded like 300 years, and this guy with a  sword is still banging it out.  Imagine.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, Vikings are walking around Times Square.  Age of Empires.  That's what the game I used to play. 
[00:42:30]  Age of Empires.  And you'd forget to like maybe kill off some of your old soldiers.  Right.  And they're still around?  Yeah, they'd still be out there even though you're shooting missiles and shit.  What a pain in the ass.  Dr. Steve, we called you about the meteor shower.  You really bothered me yesterday with your tweets and your text messages.  You didn't tell me where to look.  Oh.  Up.  And I didn't know what time I was supposed to look and what direction.  Okay.  Google it.  In my defense, I tweeted a link to an article that would tell you all about it. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, I don't click on links.  There's a lot of spam going on.  Atta boy, I hope.  I don't click on any links anymore.  Me neither.  I'm a link clicker.  Yeah.  You click the links.  On my phone.  You're a link lover.  On my phone.  You still get tricked on Twitter when the avatar is like kind of a hot chick and then all it is is a link and you're like, I gotta click on it.  Nope.  Hey, there's free iPhones. 
[00:43:30]  No, no.  They don't say anything.  It goes to that iPhone site and then it locks up your computer.  I'm sure they're stealing everything you ever fucking had on your computer.  But I can't help it.  I click every time.  Yeah.  That's bullshit.  Let me tell you about this thing.  Okay.  Yes, sir.  Wait.  What are you going to tell us about?  The Quadranted Meteor Show.  Oh, right.  Right.  Yeah.  That's what we want to know.  Yeah.  That's the reason why we.  It was only till five.  Yeah.  So what what were we supposed to look for this morning, Dr. Steve? 
[00:44:00]  Well, this is.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I think he's just like, why?  Why?  Why?  Every time we won't come up.  Ah, poor Dr. Steve.  He's such a good guy, Dr. Steve.  No, no.  He's a genuinely good guy.  We only hurt the ones we love. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Seems that way.  Our food's here.  So let's eat.  Yes.  I'm into that.  Hey, you got Oasis Live Forever?  Because, you know, we're going to live forever someday.  I hate Oasis.  You're not a fan of Oasis?  Oh, God.  Do I hate the Gallaghers?  Why do you hate it?  Because it's just whiny crap.  Give me a little live forever.  It's just a bottle of anthony.  You like this one?  No.  It's thematic.  It goes with what we were talking about. 
[00:45:00]  Oasis.  What is that?  God, you described it.  Whiny.  Sounds like a model airplane.  You don't like that?  Meow, meow, meow.  I hate it. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, God.  I enjoy when Anthony hates music, even if I like it.  I enjoy when both you guys hate music.  Makes me happy.  All right, we're going to go to break.  I don't think we'll play the whole fucking thing.  I said maybe I don't really want to know  And you're guiding worlds  Besides, you just want to fly  Lately  Is you ever feel a pain? 
[00:46:00]  In your morning rain  Of the soul shoots you to the ground  The opening of the show  Stand in the place where you live  Now face  Think about direction  Wonder why you have it now  Stand in the place where you were  Now face 
[00:46:30]  Think about the place where you live  Wonder why you haven't before  If you are confused  Check with the sun  Carry a compass  To help you along  Your feet  Are going  To be on the ground  Your head  Is there  To move you around  Getting topical  Hold up!  Wait a minute!  With the sex man 
[00:47:00]  Good morning, sexy  Good morning  Uh-oh  Why the REM?  Well, it's Michael Stipe's birthday  He's 52 years old  52  52, huh?  And based on ending with Oasis last segment  I know you don't like whiny stuff  So I figured this would be the whiniest one they got  Uh, pretty odd  I don't mind REM  Really?  Yeah  That's weird  Even though it's considered a little whiny  No, that's weird because  You don't like a lot of stuff  Why REM? 
[00:47:30]  I used to love REM  Not so much nowadays  Um, it didn't hold up  As far as my pieces  I don't know  I enjoy  I don't know why  It doesn't  I'm not saying I like REM  Uh, but it doesn't bother me like Oasis does  What's your favorite REM song?  Uh  Do you have one?  Uh, no, I probably don't even have one  Everybody Hurts  No  They're good, but I think overrated 
[00:48:00]  Well, they're an old rock band that made good  Yeah, yeah  From Athens, right?  I think so, right?  In Greek?  Oh, I actually was serious  I was dead serious  Oh  I swear to  Is that a joke?  Is that a joke?  No, no  I honestly meant that  For a half a second  Then I realized  Oh, okay  I saw your faces  I'm like  Just ass  I think REM finally retired, right?  One of those rare bands that actually retires 
[00:48:30]  And that was it  I think  And Gregorio, to answer your question  About where the Voyager is  We were talking during break  I was going to ask  It's by the  It's out  It's already past where Pluto is  And it's in the helosphere  What is that?  It's just this kind of  The Voyager, for people that don't know  We launched that in the 70s  77, yeah  1977  Yeah  So it's been out there over 30 years  35 years  36 years almost, right?  We look at where it is, roughly  Yeah  Like, look at our sun  Look at how far it's gone 
[00:49:00]  It's like  It's still in this  I think  Wait, where is it?  On the outermost part of the circle or something  No, but what  What are we looking at?  Show him where the sun is, Sam  Or I'll smack you in the face  Okay, that's the sun  Where's her  Around there somewhere  It's not even a visit  You can't even see it  That's all it's gone in 36 years  Yeah  Is that fair?  Boy, do you want it to  How long is it going to take to get into the orangey area?  Oh, I don't know  I'm not getting into the bow shock  What's the bow shock?  Oh, the bow shock 
[00:49:30]  When the bow breaks  Everybody's like, what happened?  What's the bow shock?  That's considered  Where our solar system  You missed a good one  Oh, did I?  Shit  Okay, sorry  Bow shock  It's just  Around our solar system  Because everything's moving  And then it's like  It creates like solar winds  Which is the heliosphere  Like solar  It's almost like solar winds from the sun  Yeah 
[00:50:00]  There's just a lot of shit going on up there  Are we not talking about this anymore?  It looks like a nebula  But it really is  The Matari Nebula  I just walked to the bathroom thinking  My life means nothing  Yeah  I think that every time I go to the bathroom  But then I'm like  I'm going to get back in that studio  We're going to fucking move on  Because this is depressing  Yeah  This fucking universe shit is  You find it fascinating, huh?  Oh, yeah  I avoid it at all costs  When I used to have to go to that damn planetarium  Out there in Long Island 
[00:50:30]  I would just look at the head in front of me  I didn't want to know shit  Oh, I love that stuff  I don't like knowing how insignificant everything is  Yeah  But it makes the humor so much better  When you can incorporate deep space into it  Of course  Like a lot of times I'll say to some girl  She'll be like  Well, I don't really feel like walking  I'll go  Where are we going?  Proxima century?  Oh, she goes nuts  And she starts laughing, I bet  Yeah  A lot of people are very mad  We might have said R.E.M. overrated  No way  I said that  Jim Norton said it  James P. Norton? 
[00:51:00]  Yes, and I accept the fact that a lot of people  Think my opinion is bunk  With that  R.E.M. had  Bollocks  R.E.M. had a hell of a career, man  I'm sure they did  Good for them  God bless  Godspeed  Get home safe  Overrated  Hell of a career  I just thought they were overrated  Everybody hurts  You don't like that one?  Do you?  Why are you so hurt?  It's a good tune  This is a good tune  It is a good tune  Just another  Because we're all hurting  Inside  We're all hurting  Would you just listen  Would this strike a nerve 
[00:51:30]  When you're not used to hear it, Jimmy?  No  No, it doesn't  You didn't hurt  No  You wouldn't listen to the words  Oh, boy  This one will put you over the edge  Make you just fucking  Blow your brains out  Right now Fez is going to cry  Oh, no  Why did we do this?  It's a standalone song, really  Why would you say that?  Well, I just know this is the type of song that gets them going  Gets the waterworks going  Just don't know why you'd bring it up  And then Ann had to say it's a standalone song 
[00:52:00]  Well  You  This would resonate with me if it was everybody jerks  Everybody  Everybody squirts  Everyone squirts?  Yes  Everyone does  You're right  Let the record state that E-Rock is about to do something  Not me  Not Anthony  And not Jim Norton  All right  E-Rock  This is an E-Rock pick  Eat or bungle 
[00:52:30]  I guess so, yeah  Now the blueberry is one that can't work on its own  It has to have something with it  Like the kiwi  It's not a  A standalone  Standalone fruit  The voice is going to get the spot after the Super Bowl  That's, of course, if we have a Super Bowl this coming season 
[00:53:00]  Oh, boy  Oh, boy  I had nothing to do with that  Oh, boy  Sabbath overrated, Jimmy  It's coming in  Sure they were  Their 10th year  They finally got into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  Critics hated them  You're right  Terribly overrated  They're attacking you back  Because you said R.E.M. is overrated  I know they are  Turns out there's a lot of R.E.M. fans out there 
[00:53:30]  God bless them  We should stand in our high school lockers and have Rock Wars  Douchebags  Shut up  Sabbath got no respect from the critics  While these fucking whinging jizzbags got all the credit  What were some of the Rock Wars?  Sabbath Zeppelin  Definitely  Sabbath Zeppelin was the big one  But what were some of the other Rock Wars?  That's hilarious  I forgot all about that  Kiss  Was there a Van Halen Who thing for a while?  Yeah, all of this  Yeah  Do you remember the Rock Wars?  They were kind of in different eras a little bit  But 
[00:54:00]  When I was growing up  The weirdos listened to Queen  Yeah, yeah  Believe it or not  Too cool for the room guys  Yeah  Maybe a little  A little too intellectual  That's a good one  Van Halen Rush  Was pretty much  Oh, that was a Rock War  Yeah, man  That was absolutely a Rock War  Tears for Fears  And The Fix  That was a good one  Rock Wars  Rock Wars  You're a faggot if you're like  Dad, get out of here  Yeah, I don't care what people think 
[00:54:30]  Of my opinion  No  No, I just say it  I don't hate R.E.M.  I just think that  Well, you made fun of their band, Jimmy  Yeah, they're like  It's kind of like when people make fun of Ozzy  Your claws come out  Not necessarily  If they don't like Ozzy, I respect that  It's fine, they don't like him  Do you like the fact that Crazy Train  Is a commercial now  Sure, why not  Of that family  I don't look at that stuff as a sellout at all  When bands, I don't care  It's like, yeah, why not  Like, why should I own  Loving that song  Yeah  I have no problem with that 
[00:55:00]  Remember when that was considered a big sellout  Oh, fuck yeah, man  Not anymore, really  Oh, yeah, it was  Now, though  Because people  People who call you a sellout for that  Are people who aren't being offered  Like, it's not their work  So it's like you don't know how  Someone feels about their own work being used  You're not a sellout just because you allow your  Like, where's the artistic integrity to go  No  Crazy Train  Should only be listening to here, here, and here  Don't listen to it there  What?  Man  Yeah, just dicks 
[00:55:30]  But there was a time  You were looked at as a douche  For allowing your music to be in a movie or a commercial  Do you know, there are actors that will not do any TV  Like Nicholson, who I love  Is a guy who refuses to  Absolutely refuses to do television in any form  He's never been on TV?  I know  He may have been  Except for like the talk shows  The Oscars or whatever  He won't even do the talk shows anymore  But TV's different now  He thinks it's just shit  It's not like he's doing a fucking NBC must-see TV sitcom  There's, you know, Showtime and HBO 
[00:56:00]  And all those avenues of great TV shows that are coming out now  And movies that they're making  It must be nice to get to a point where you decide  I don't do TV because it's shit  He doesn't do press for any of this stuff  Imagine that  That's how fucking famous he is  Yeah  And respected  Yeah, and three Oscars  I mean, it's kind of hard to argue with  And maybe if the movies weren't pouring in for him  He'd go to TV, you know  Do you think?  Well, in his younger days  Yeah  Yeah  He could do whatever he wants  What do you want to do? 
[00:56:30]  He's never got a fuses  Here's another Rock War  Priest and Maiden  Oh, yeah, yeah  It was a classic  Sure  I would have went with Maiden  Yeah  Yeah  Ozzy Sabbath, too, in the early 80s  When he left Sabbath and they had Dio  Oh  That was a big one  Yeah, Sal's right from Tampa  Frankie goes to Hollywood  And Wham  That was a massive  Oh, giant  Giant rock war  Rock  Really?  That competition was 
[00:57:00]  Who had the gayer front man?  Metallica Megadeth  Rock War  Is ACDC on, like, Kmart commercial now or something?  Wow, really?  Or something  Is that possible?  Walmart, maybe  Floyd Zeppelin was never a rock war  Floyd and Queensryche, maybe  Wow, look at that sun coming down the hall  That's sweet  Oh, it's S-U-N  Oh  Why'd you say that, then? 
[00:57:30]  Oh  That's pretty amazing  Look at that  That's cool  Sun coming up in between the buildings  And shining off all the glass down the hall  Burning  Still freezing out  Yeah, I know  It's finally winter, though  We've had it easy so far  All right  I'd like to keep it that way  Stipe 52  That's where we were at  Thanks to E-Rock  Yeah  Don Shula  82  Holy fuck  When did he stop coaching the Dolphins?  20 years?  Not even? 
[00:58:00]  2000...  Oh, it was 2000  Okay  2005, I believe  Don Shula  Hey, we haven't announced who's coming on the show today  We've got Robert Kelly coming in very soon  Yes  We have Chris Kyle  Who's Chris Kyle, eh?  Oh, my God  American Sniper  Yeah  He's got a book out called American Sniper  He's a real Navy SEAL  Thank you  We've had some people who have questionable credentials as far as Navy SEALs go  In here  If you know what I mean 
[00:58:30]  Jesse became governor 13 years ago  13 years, that was?  Isn't that amazing?  And this is the autobiography of the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history  This guy's offed quite a few fucking people  Really?  Oh, yeah  This guy is a killer  What's his numbers, you think?  What was it, a couple hundred?  He sniped a couple hundred?  He says 255  Yeah  And I think the Pentagon will credit him for like 160-something 
[00:59:00]  Oh, well, that's it  Why don't they credit for all of them?  What the fuck?  They need that confirmation  Other people seeing it  And sometimes you've got to do some things  Yeah, maybe sometimes they're like, ah, we don't want to count that one  The government knows, you know, but we're going to keep it on the QT  Yeah  You think you would do well in Call of Duty?  Probably not  You know, it's like those things  See, that's what we should have done today  Hook up Call of Duty  We've got to start doing bits again  Let them grab a sniper rifle on that game 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, you play them in Call of Duty  Oh my God  That would have been great  Or let some fat nerd beat them  Yeah  That would be great  Some 12-year-old pimpled-faced kid  Yeah, that's weird to think  Like, here he is  He's got a book  He's walking around  He's doing all the news shows and everything like that  And he's killed a lot of people  Now, you know, some people, I guess, have a problem with that  And the context of killing seems to be very important to people, you know 
[01:00:00]  In what context was that person killed?  But meanwhile, the end result is still someone killing another person  But it's an easy kill  Yeah?  Yeah, I think anyone could snipe somebody  Jesus, I don't know  See that head explode in the scope?  A rough kill is you fighting for your life and all you have is a brick and you've got to kill the individual  Well, yeah, a rough kill is...  Saving Private Ryan up in that room with the knife fight with the Nazi  That's a rough one  That would give you nightmares 
[01:00:30]  But I think if you snipe someone  How far?  Mile?  Mile and a half?  Well  How far do these snipers go?  Up to a mile  Up to a mile?  Mile and a half, yeah  I thought I was about right  Okay  You never see the actual dead body  That's easy  You sleep nights  You see a little red mist and see them drop in most cases  You get a good night's sleep after that  Yeah  But if you've got a brick and you're killing somebody  That's gotta be horrific  But the thing is, you've got the numbers too  You've got numbers where you've got to go like 
[01:01:00]  Wow, I ended the life of a couple of hundred people  Like this guy  If he wasn't  If it wasn't in context of war  Would be one of the biggest mass murderers  In history  And who's to say?  I know  That's just it  Maybe he should have that title too  But he  But because  Someone told him  That his cause is just  And he is  Oh wow  Allowed to do this  It turns out he's like a cool  Sniper guy  That's a fucked up thought  Instead of the mass murderer 
[01:01:30]  Of people  Because our government has decided this is okay  Right  Oh that's fucked up  We're going to talk to a serial killer today  Serial killer  I actually want to ask him kind of about the ethical  You know, the ethical question about that  But  That's cool  And meanwhile  I don't care  Believe me  I love the thought that this guy went out there  And exploded the heads of savages  That wanted to kill us anyway  When was he a Navy SEAL? 
[01:02:00]  What years basically?  A Navy SEAL  What were we up to?  He was in there up to  Where was he?  Iraq  And  Afghanistan  He left the military in 2009  2009, yeah  So he did some Iraq stuff  99 to 2009  Oh, he reportedly claims to have taken out 255 people in the Iraq war  Yeah  But the Pentagon could not confirm that number  Is he reporting for duty?  Here's a guy that reported for duty, yes  Reporting for duty 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, but let me see  I just pick up a book  And I'll just get like a  Right here he goes  On the most shooting situations  I adjust for elevations  But not for windage  Explain  Go  Go  And here's his numbers broken down  160 kills in the Iraq war  As a Navy SEAL sniper  Making him America's deadliest marksman  We're talking to the number one guy  Previous record was  109 kills in Vietnam  He fucking beat the shit out of that record  Smaller heads too to shoot 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, but he had children  Vietnam had children  That's easier, right?  Probably  Yeah  Oh, he's got pictures  So we're going to talk to him in a little while  And  We also have Donald Trump Jr. coming in  Cool  I like this guy  I do too  He made it easier for  Donald Trump Jr.  His father to come on  I think he might have  I think he might have helped us bridge that  Bridge  Build that 
[01:03:30]  Rebuild that bridge  He's coming in with  We're not sure if it's Mario, Michael, or  It's definitely not Mario  It's not  All right  It's not Mario  What are our choices still?  Michael and Marco Andretti  Okay  Roland's not really sure, is he?  Because Marco Andretti, who's the grandson of Mario  He's the grandson of Mario  The son of Michael  Is it Mario?  Mario  Do you say Mario, Ann?  Or Mario?  Mario  I say, uh  Just say it, go  Mario  Yeah, why do you say Mario? 
[01:04:00]  Mario  No one says Mario  A lot of people say Mario  Schmuck, they don't  Mario's wigs  Mario  No, it's Mori  It's Mori Andretti  No, it's Mario  Everyone says Mario  Yeah, I know  Why do you say Mario?  You say costume  Mario is a very, like, New York-y thing  Mario is how you pronounce it  Mario  It's not  Yeah  What are you, Italian now?  No, Mario  Hey, Mario  Michael Andretti was just on TV, by the way  Mario  Mario  Which one?  Mario  How'd that song go on the Bob Grant show?  I said, that'd be 
[01:04:30]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da  Sfachi  I can't remember that either  It was about  Yeah, that was funny  Is Bob Grant still around?  Hopefully  I think so  Love that guy  So who are we getting today, Travis?  Is it Michael, or  What's our other choice again?  I forgot already  Marco  Marco  Polo  Roland says Michael  Yeah, I think it is Michael  I just saw him on TV  Alright  Michael was on TV?  He looks like a fucking snowman  Look at stupid  Bumbling down the hall  You don't like his hat?  What is he doing? 
[01:05:00]  Bobby Kelly's walking down the hall  He looks like he's bundled up  Why does he look so miserable?  I know it's cold out  But  It's cold  He's been inside for a while now  Oh man  Yeah  Oh, his hat sucks  Bobby  What is he wearing?  He's gotta drop some tonnage there  Yeah, we're a little worried about it  Some gross tonnage  Just send him in  We'll be fucking  Yeah, exactly  So we got  Alright, so we got  It looks like Michael  Yeah, Roland says  The email says Michael  But Michael's not on the  Yeah, that's what didn't make sense  To me and Sam  Alright  Entertainment Weekly  Him and I were really hoping 
[01:05:30]  That it was  Huh?  Entertainment Weekly  And all the other articles  Say Marco is on the show  Yeah, we're on the show  24-year-old Marco  Jimmy was farting  Or eating eggs  One or the other  Did he fart again, Jimmy?  No, I did not  What did you say?  We're very non-what?  Nonchalant  Oh, okay  I liked being chalant  It smells like food, though  It doesn't smell like farts  It smells like an actual dish  We just ate  Yes, we were just eating  But it smells like somebody  Farted out a dish  Oh, a dish  You know when you walk into a hallway  In New York City  And you know  Your neighbor's cooking something 
[01:06:00]  I hate that  It never smells good  I live next to an Indian dude  Indian food smells horrendous  I never got into Indian food  Is it tasty, though?  I want to eat it  I don't know  Very tasty  But that  The smell  Yeah  It's horrible  When it's in a hallway  Soak into everything  Fuck it  Yeah, when you go into  An apartment building  And someone's cooking  It always smells horrid  Our old pal Jay from Framingham  Yeah  Framingham Mass  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That's where he got his name  And go over there once in a while  And same thing 
[01:06:30]  He had an Indian fucking couple  That cooked all the time  And you could smell it  In his apartment  Stop cooking  New Indians  Curry  I like curry  I've had curry  Curry's good  Patrice used to cook  A mean curry  Yeah  Yeah, him and his  Haitian roommate Will  A good old Will  Just green  You'd be like  What the fuck  What Haitian dish is that  And a hoof sticking out of it  And then you're like  It's not that bad  A dolphin fin  Will will always be known as  Coffin opener now  Oh my God  Jesus Christ  Yeah, Will is it 
[01:07:00]  Did you ever talk about that?  Sort of  Yeah, we did  We did a little bit  We're all like  Deeply depressed  There's only eight of us  In the church  In Patrice's coffin  And Will walks up  And opens it  In front of everybody  And the funeral director  Panics  Yeah, but he opened up  The wrong end  What a dumb Haitian  Oh God  He opened up the feet  But he just walked up  Didn't ask anyone  And opened up the lid  I don't think I've ever seen  Anyone do that before  I didn't think that was that weird  Even though I probably should have  And Colin goes  Oh, in their country  You know, they get in  You know  Colin was, of course, very funny 
[01:07:30]  Of course he was  That's where they sleep  They make that into a residence  But were you suspicious  When the funeral director  Ran up and stopped him  And I'm thinking to myself  Oh my God  He's not even in that coffin  Yeah  For a split second  I'm thinking he's not in  And this whole thing is a scam  Meaning the funeral business  Oh man  Where you don't actually have the body  In the coffin at the church  I just  I just didn't want anybody  To get offended  And I didn't want to see  Some  I wasn't ready to see  Patrice yet  And I was  You know, that's like a  Once you do that 
[01:08:00]  It's a wrap  You're like  Yeah, yeah, yeah  That's when it goes  Ah, fuck  Up until then  There's a point where you'd be like  Hey, you know  That thing's gonna swing open  Dude, what's up?  You know, fucking  Ashton Cush is gonna run out  Yeah, punk you  But at that moment  I wasn't ready for that  And he walked over to that coffin  And we all froze  We all just  Oh yeah, we did  Like we all just  I couldn't move  I saw him walking over  And I'm like  And I just  And he  He whipped it open  And looked at his feet  Who does that?  And the guy was 
[01:08:30]  I don't know  Yeah, the cough  The funeral guy  Was like  Sir, sir, sir, sir  You know, you wanna go  Motherfucker  Don't fucking open that  Yeah, yeah  Sir, sir, sir  Sir, sir, sir  But he was in there  And he was in his suit  And he did  You know what I mean  I was glad we saw him  I was glad we saw him  But I wasn't ready to see him  And then when we finally saw him  It was like  Oh shit  And he looked  I mean  People say that  But Patrice looked like Patrice  And it was a weird moment  Because we all just stared for  It had to be five minutes  Without not one person  Saying a word  Really strange moment  Because that's the moment  It's actual 
[01:09:00]  I mean, for me  Where it was real  Where it's like  This is no fucking joke  Like this is  Yeah  You're like, holy shit  It made it easier for some reason  I don't know why  That made it easier for me  Seeing him  Yeah, it was alright  It made it a little bit easier  For some reason  Like it's part of it  And he looked okay  For some reason  That just made things  Slightly easier  No, it fucked me up, dude  When I saw that  I was like  You know, because  I have this fucking thing  Going on where it's  You know  We don't talk all the time anyways  None of us  It's like, you know 
[01:09:30]  A couple months or a week  Yeah, yeah  We're always on the road  So you have that relationship  That regular people  Don't understand  And then  I had that with Patrice  I even talked to him  For a month or two  Or whatever  Hey, what's up  I was right back into it  So it's still  I still have that  Like he's on the road  So it's still  Yeah, it was still  Enough time left  Yeah, Dane had a joke  About that  About his mom and dad dying  Yeah  Because his mom and dad  Died the same year  Same year  Yeah  Oof  That's rough  I remember we were in the car  We were going to a gun  We were going to shoot guns in LA

[01:19:30]  To New York  To just come  And then  Drop off stuff  And then  Head on out  You know  Not the whole lot  You can do  When you got a semi  I guess  I'll just wait  Till somebody  Decides to say  Something about  I guess  I don't know  Usually I get  Hung upon  So I  Gotta keep  Looking to see  If somebody's there  Pretty nice 
[01:20:00]  To have some  Logos on the side  Whatever ones  You want to pick out  Nice and big  You know  Put whatever you  Want on it  Back and forth  California  To the east coast  Twice a month  Seems like  A lot of people  Would see it  I'm going to

[01:22:00]  Advertising than  Sirius X  I'm just  Ever done  And who's  Going to pay  For that  For free  He's going to  Do it  He's a fan  He's going to  Go to like  Staples  Or something  What  Really  You understood  That part of it  Yeah  I think  Something like that  He's going to  Print stuff up  Make it really big  I love it if he  Just used a regular  Printer  And put like  Kiss your faces  On the side  With tape  And black and white  Tape little  Paper stuff  Most of it  Blew off  On the first  Fucking street  It's just  Little Jimmy's face

[01:23:30]  Let's do this  Bring our guests in  We got Bob Kelly  In studio  Playing the Wilbur Theater  This Saturday night  Tickets available  And I would go  In a second  Bobby  I'm telling you right now  Our podcast by the way  Is 19,000 downloads  In two days  The one I did  Yeah  Nice  Crazy  Very cool  Hello sir  How are you  We're on the air  We got Chris Kyle  How are you doing  Promoting American Sniper  In bookstores and Amazon  Right now  Pleasure 
[01:24:00]  When did your book  Actually come out  Was it today  Yesterday  Oh Wednesday  So welcome to the show  Thank you for having me  Just what a great story man  Sniper  Most lethal  In U.S. military history  That's a hell of a title  To have  I gotta thank the publicist  For that  Yeah huh  That's definitely  I was trying to get  A different story out there  But that's the title  Oh are you  I'm trying to show  All the sacrifices  That military members  Go through  And then the families  After we leave 
[01:24:30]  What they have to go through  And the sacrifices  They make  This is a better  Selling title though  Nobody's gonna buy  Like  It's easier to sell this  And then you get to it  In the book  Because like  You know  Right  You know  Sniper with a heart  Probably wouldn't do as well  As this  Definitely sniper  Yeah people just wanna hear about  Well the fact of the matter is  Sniper is  There's a great mystique  Around the sniper  Especially lately  We've heard a few of the stories  That have come out  With the Somali pirates  And stuff  Just these 
[01:25:00]  The image of  Those snipers  Taking that shot  Those shots  At the pirates  In the ship  Really gets people's  Fascination up  About snipers  Definitely  Now how did you get into it  Well when I went into the military  As a new guy  My chief  Finally said  Okay  If you wanna go to sniper school  I will nominate you  At the time  You had to be nominated  And chief was willing to say  You're a good enough shot  I will send you to sniper school  And you were a good enough shot 
[01:25:30]  Because you had shot  Previously  Your whole life  Pretty much right  I had grown up  With weapons  Hunting my whole life  How long had you been a SEAL  By that point  It was a new guy  So I don't think  I didn't go to be a sniper  Until I came back  From my first deployment  Which came back in 03  So in fact  When you come back  From deployment  You get about a month off  To where you can  Try to readjust  Back into civilian life  And learn your way around  And I end up taking 
[01:26:00]  Instead of that month  I took about two weeks off  So I could go straight  Into sniper school  And what was it about  Sniper school  And becoming a sniper  That kind of fascinated you  I thought they had  All the cool toys  They had the scoped rifles  And they got the  Really expensive guns  They're taking  Precision shots  I thought  Wow those guys  Are really good  Whatever they want to shoot  They're hitting  Yeah  What is the  The first time  You shoot somebody  And this is such a  Civilian question  But I'm a civilian  Is it hard for you  The first time you do it 
[01:26:30]  Or  It definitely was  Especially my first shot  Was on a woman  And  Yeah  Fucking bitch  Wow  What was her problem  What the fuck  No she  A supper cold  Yeah what game  Did she talk to  She was  She was out in the town  Greeting the marines  During the invasion  As the marines  Were coming into  The city there  The people were  Coming out  To you know  Show their support  For the marines  So the marines  Wouldn't shoot them down  Let them know  That hey 
[01:27:00]  We're not fighting you  You just go ahead  And come right on in  Well she came out  Into the crowd  She had a grenade on her  She pulled the pin  And was walking  To the marines  Whoa  Now how did you know  To keep focus on her  Or were you watching  From a distance  Or were you close  I was close  I was in the city already  Okay  I was up in top  Of a building  Watching  Trying to keep track  Of the crowd  And my job  Was anything  That we could  Try to soften  The target  For the marines  So less of them  Would have injuries  And that was our job  So now what was  What did you have to do 
[01:27:30]  Before you took  That shot  I turned to my chief  And I said  This is what she's got  This is what she's doing  And he kept saying  You gotta take her out  You gotta take her out  What if she was  Just eating an apple  Yeah  How did you know  Give her a bigger hole  In her head  To put the apple in  What made you look at her  Out of the whole crowd  And go  There's something weird  About that  Well first of all  The grenade  Was the Chinese grenade  It's yellow in color  And just you know  When you're out there  Trying to watch  All of a sudden  You see a color flash 
[01:28:00]  It definitely draws  Your attention to it  But why do they use yellow  Yeah  That's silly  That's a little too obvious  At least some ground  Light fuse get away  It's kind of racist too  Oh please  That is something  So I guess  You have to be up  On other weapons  And what the threat  Could be  That's coming up  To some of the guys  I mean you can tell too  It's not just the color  But once you  Actually  The color is what  Drew my eye to it  But then once I started  Actually getting it  In the scope  Zooming in on it  And trying to really  Identify what she had 
[01:28:30]  It was easy to tell  It has a fuse on it  And you can see  The way she was holding it  What was in her hand  And so I'm describing  Everything to my chief  Of what I see  Right  He says that's  A Chinese grenade  So now the chief  Gives the order  Or gives you  The permission  To take the shot  And this is  Your first  Your first kill  At all  Or your first kill  As a sniper  No I wasn't even  A sniper  This was my first  Deployment  I was just  On a sniper rifle  Oh okay  And he told me 
[01:29:00]  I had to take the shot  Where'd you hit her head  No I always aim  Center mass  It was  Unless  You know  If you go for the head  It just leaves  More area  Of error  Right  So try to shoot  Center mass  It leaves more room  To be able to hit  The target  Double tap  Well it was just  Single shot  I mean  Big enough caliber  It takes one round  What were you using  It was a 300  Win mag  Oh my god  And you were proven  Right  She had a grenade  Right  Yes  Oh yes  As soon as I shot her  You know  She went down  The grenade fell 
[01:29:30]  Went off  Her iPod fell out  Of her hand  She had a grenade  Case on it  Grenade case  She's just trying  To be hip  She's a hipster  She's just going  On Amazon  It's a cool  Grenade case  Yes  Have you ever played  I mean this is a  Stupid question  But have you ever  Played Call of Duty  And those video games  And been a sniper  And just sucked  Oh yes  What pisses us off  We go overseas  On the deployments  Or whatever  And we could link up  To play online  Right  And then you got this 
[01:30:00]  You got the headset on  And everything  And you're playing  A 12 year old  He at Stakeside  See this is the same thing  And he is talking  Mad crap  And I'm sitting there  Going  You have no idea  I knew it  That's hilarious  I knew it  All those little bastards  All the time  We knew it  You suck  You couldn't  Fucking shoot me  I nailed you  I nailed you  Really  Did you  Did you  I just killed  150 guys  For real  You shit  But if you say  I'm a real sniper  They'd be like 
[01:30:30]  No you're not  Fuck you  They would never  Believe you anyway  Oh no  Not at all  I mean they'd be like  I wish you a real sniper  In this game  Cause you suck  That's funny man  What did you  Can I ask you  What you did  Back to  After the kill  The moment you did it  What feeling did you have  Like after you realized  Wow I've done this  You knew you had to  It's more surreal  I mean first of all  It seems like it took forever  For me to pull the  Actually pull the trigger  And take that shot  Cause you're running  Through your mind  Okay  Can I actually 
[01:31:00]  Within myself  Kill someone  And then not just that  But is the government  Gonna stand behind me  And not put me on trial  For murder  Right  Especially with it being a woman  I mean it definitely  Changes it up  When you go to war  You're thinking  I'm gonna kill  The enemy army  Well there's not an army  That's fighting us  And now there's a woman  So  God that shouldn't be  Something that a guy  Has to think about  That's in that situation  It's so odd  That you have to think  About your own freedom  At that point  And if you take this shot  And then the repercussions 
[01:31:30]  If you decide not to  And she  You know  Sets that grenade off  And kills some guys  Now you gotta live with that  So  If somebody ever invaded America  You know  My mom would walk out  With a grenade  Oh of course  Or her fucking  You know what I mean  Or her fucking lasagna  Nothing  Oh boy  Food joke  Yeah  We're all assuming  Was that the first time  You killed somebody  It was  It was  Wow  Did you have  And you know the implications  If you miss  Is that soldiers  Are gonna be killed  Were there any times 
[01:32:00]  When you were shooting  Where you missed  Definitely  And something happened  That you were trying  To prevent  Stupid wind  Oh definitely  The wind  You know anything  You jerk the trigger  You throw the shot  You know  I have been lucky  In a lot of my shots  As far as making a lot  But I am by far  Not the greatest shot  Not the greatest sniper  I just happen to be  In the right place  At the right time  And been in a lot  Of different actions  Because we were in Iraq  We did a comedy show  And they had to put  These barriers 
[01:32:30]  Behind the stage  Because over the wall  They had snipers  Looking at us  Right  And they brought me  On a roof  With the guys like you  Snipers  And they let me  Look through the scope  Looking back at them  And you guys  Sometimes just look  At each other  Like and don't fire  You have to wait  Till they fire on you  Till you can take  Them out sometimes  Right  It depends on the  Rules of engagement  The ROEs at the time  Now there are times  That every time  I was out there  If someone was looking  At me through a sniper rifle  I was allowed  To take the shot  Wow  Yeah that seems 
[01:33:00]  Pretty threatening  Yes  Right there  Boy that's the ultimate  Heckle there  Isn't it  You better be on  So you went  To deployment once  And you wanted  To be a SEAL  What made you  Want to be a SEAL  Which is so much  Harder training  Well I went in  To be a SEAL  Oh I'm sorry  Okay you did  And then you  A sniper on your  Second run through  We've heard about  The Navy SEALs  Over the years  I mean the training  Most guys drop out  Right what's the  Percentage again  Well I went through  It was about 250  Started and 24  Of us graduated  That's 10% 
[01:33:30]  Yeah that's  That's insane  90% of really  Tough guys  Are saying  In shape guys  In shape  Thinking they can  Do it  I've watched  Documentaries on  The training  And sat there  And literally  As I'm watching  Just going  I'm just exhausted  Watching it  Why are you putting  Sand in your pants  That's so uncomfortable  That's all I think  The logs  They have to go  In the water  And lift it back up  And there's always  That one weak guy  In the middle  Just his arms  Just shaking  I will completely  Walk around a puddle  On the street now  I hate the water 
[01:34:00]  Was there a point  Where you wanted to quit  When you were going  Through that training  Oh definitely  If they would have  Brought the bell to me  I was just too lazy  To get up  To get to go  To ring it  I mean  Is there an app  An app  A bell app  Dang I'm out  They could get  A lot of quitters  If they put that bell  By your bed  That way when you  Wake up  And you're like  You know what  I'm just going  To have coffee  This morning  Yeah  What is it  An hour  An hour a night  Is that hell week  Where you sleep  For an hour a night  Oh no no no  During hell week  We had two hours  Throughout the week 
[01:34:30]  To sleep  And it was  Two separate nights  Where we were allowed  To actually get an hour  That night  Holy shit  And it wasn't in a bed  I was sleeping  Underneath a boat  In the sand  Oh man  I don't get that  How do you  Like they have these things  Where people stay up  For days  I mean  Is that something  You have to teach  Your body to do  I mean  I can stay up  For maybe 24 hours  And I'm done  No it was fear  I mean  You were scared  To death  Of those instructors  Really  But they keep you  Constantly active  You're always  Having an activity  We played soccer  At one point 
[01:35:00]  When you get so far  Into it  Then they start  Taking a lot  Of the physical  To where you  Could actually hurt  Yourself  They start  Taking that away  And just keep you  Going as far as  All right  We're going to do  Runs  Push ups  You're going to  Go play soccer  And just keeping  Activities going  Do they give you  A hug  I can imagine that  A little hug  Just to keep you  Going  Yeah like we really  Like you deep down  Right deep down  If you quit  You can have  All the hugs  You want  What is the one  Thing that knocks  Most of the guys out  Is there one activity 
[01:35:30]  Or one  Out of the 90%  Honestly  During hell week  I  You don't recognize  When guys are quitting  Wow  You just  You keep going  And then you realize  Oh so and so  Is not here anymore  You don't actually  See it  Because they keep you  Going  Doing so much stuff  That you don't see  The guys when they  Just decide  I quit  And we hear about  Guys like the  Team 6  Like the  Quote on quote  You know  That's the one  That a lot  Even the Navy SEALs  Have trouble going  Through on that  Type of a training  What's the difference  Between that training 
[01:36:00]  I mean what  You're allowed to  Talk about  And what you guys do  Basically you've got  All the other SEAL teams  And then SEAL team 6  You're the best of the best  You go back through  Another Buds  The boot camp  Again  It's geared a little  Different  It's not as much  Of a beat down  Now they're trying  To see  Okay  Are you really the best  Can you perform  This way  And it's  It's about another  Six months long  To where they're  Testing you out  How long  What's the longest  You ever went in battle  Without sleeping 
[01:36:30]  I mean it's just you  And you have another guy  With you to  When you're sniping  To give you the range  And all that stuff  Right  Or is it just you  No I didn't  I didn't go out  And just me  And usually when I went out  Especially in the city  Yeah  You go out  Pretty heavily  So there's about 16 of us  I mean  So it's not like  Billy Zane  Where you're just you  And some dude  And just you're sitting out  For three days  And you kill the one  El Capitan  And then run for your life  To get the helicopter  So you're just with the troop  But it's just in the city 
[01:37:00]  You're just  You're not sniping from  You know  2,000 yards out  Right  No I did that one time  But you know  2,100 was my farthest shot  But other than that  It's  Most of your shots  Are anywhere from  Two to 400 yards  Really  Wow  Wow  And what did you train on  Mostly  What kind of rifles  Well it all depends on  With the mission  Before I'd go in  I'd look at overhead imagery  Try to figure out  What's the possible  Longest shot I could take  Like the video game  With the loadout  Yeah right 
[01:37:30]  Let me trade this  I'm going to grab this  On Call of Duty  What sniper should I use  What rifle should I use  Ask the 12 year old  Exactly  I want to ask Chris  About the numbers  Because the government  Won't confirm  That you killed  255 people  In the book  It says over 150  Over 150  But you know it's more  You know your number  I'm happy with 150  Oh okay  So you don't need  To have the 
[01:38:00]  Is it harder for you  As a person  If the number's higher  Like it sounds cool to us  Because we're fucking nerds  But is it  Like the guy  Who actually did it  Do you go  You know 150's fine  I don't need 250  I mean I don't even  Care about the number  But as far as the record goes  I don't care  Because it's going to be beat  And I hope it gets beat soon  That way someone else  Will be in the limelight  But a lot of people say  You killed up to 255 people  I've seen that all over  And he's smiling  So what is a confirmed kill  Someone else has to see you do it  Or how do they confirm a kill  Well every time I went out 
[01:38:30]  Because I wasn't alone  There were always guys there  To see it  And to actually witness it  Every time I would take a shot  I have to take down  Make notes of  The time I took the shot  The distance the guy was  What he was doing  What he was wearing  What he was carrying  What I shot him with  The grain of the bullet  You know what the temperature  It's like an expense report  Yeah yeah  Wow the business  And you have to do that  Like right then  Or do you have like  Can you wait till you're safe  You have to break out  Hang on one second  Hold that fire  Well usually when I was 
[01:39:00]  Taking my shots  There was an officer  Who was on the radio  That was his job  During that time  Was to be the radio watch  To keep the base notified  Of what we were doing  He would take down the notes  When we'd get back  Is when we'd actually fill out  The formal report  Like cops  Right  What the fuck  Those cocksuckers  Used to run out in the street  With a grenade  And we'd get to fill out reports  Yeah  With the grain of the  This weed shit  There's no way anyone  I do it on Call of Duty  I protect the country  Okay  There's no way anyone 
[01:39:30]  Would write you up  For a speeding ticket  At this point right  Oh you'd be surprised  Not on base  You actually will get  A speeding ticket  You can't pull out a card  Like look who I am  No  Yeah right  Look who I am  You don't have like  A gold bullet  You'd be surprised  I mean a lot of people  View especially  Other people in the military  Seals with  We have this huge ego  And this bad attitude  And it's come from  In the past  Guys have thought  You know what  I'm better than you are  So it's taken us a long time  But you are better than me  Yeah  In every way 
[01:40:00]  Yeah  Your facial hair connects  Everything about you  Your accent  Everything  It took us a long time  Showing these guys  Look we're not better than you are  We're just trained differently  And we were more specialized  In an area than you were  It doesn't make me any better  And we were working  With the army conventionals  Showing them  Hey I'm here to help you  We're all on the same team  You have to obey traffic laws  It sucks  Did you ever have a problem  With the ethical side of it  Where you know 
[01:40:30]  It's when you boil it down  It's just  It's killing people  And I wonder how difficult  That is for you  Or was at some point  When you really think that  You know semantics  Is one thing  That's you know  Okay  If I wasn't given permission  To do what I did  I'd be  What would be considered  A mass murderer  Really  And since I have been  Given permission  From the government  I'm not 
[01:41:00]  Yet  It's the same end result  How do you deal with that  Internally  Well I never looked at it  As I'm there killing people  I looked at it  As I'm there saving people  My job was to make sure  Everybody I deployed with  Came home  Right  And all the allies  Everyone surrounded me  My job is to protect them  I want everybody  As much as possible  To be able to come home  And believe me  That's how I feel  I just brought that question up  Because these assholes  Want to know  I was thinking  That Chris must think  You're such a radical  Lefty pan 
[01:41:30]  I know  You have no idea  You're like what  Believe me  You have no idea  Who just asked that question  He has a 50 cal  Like a real one  He brushes his teeth  I brought this for you  To sign for me  It's the  It's a 50 cal magazine  50 cal mag  Out of the  M107  I got it home  I got one of those  It's a pisser to shoot  Isn't it  It doesn't give out numbers  But he owns  He owns a bunch of guns  Yeah  Somewhere between  4 and 2,000  I love them  You guys should definitely  Hang out  I actually wanted 
[01:42:00]  To ask you something  About the Barrett  I know  When I've fired this  The concussion  Off of it  I describe it  As feeling like  You have the flu  For three seconds  It's a concussion  Or feeling like  You were just  Popped in the nose  For like a second  How do you  How do you  Shoot this  For as long  As you do  And not just  Lose your mind  Because it's  I mean in training  Obviously when you're  Out in the field  You're probably not  Shooting it that much  Right 
[01:42:30]  Out in the field  I never took  The .50 cal out  Oh you didn't  It's big  It's heavy  The rounds weigh a lot  When if I took  A .338 Lapua  It weighs less  The rounds weigh less  And I can actually  Shoot farther  And more accurately  Oh okay  How big are those bullets  I don't know anything  About guns  Compared to a .50 cal  They're definitely smaller  Everything's smaller  In a .50 cal  Yeah yeah  The .50 is crazy  So what would  What would the .50 be  Optimum for  Vehicle  Vehicle  Okay  Wow  Shooting through engines  Wow  Actually we 
[01:43:00]  We started making  Because they were saying  The .50 cal sniper rifle  Should be used for vehicles  But anytime you shoot a vehicle  You're going to shoot it  Through the engine block  It's not going to  Automatically seize up  And stop  Right  The best way to stop  A vehicle is to shoot  The driver  The driver  Yes  And then it just  Veers off to the left  To the right  Hey what about  Do you have  Numerical rankings  In what you  I know very little  What was  I was thinking about  Lee Harvey Oswald  And how people said 
[01:43:30]  He couldn't have made  That shot  But he was actually  A sharpshooter  He was actually  A great shot  I don't think he was  Probably what you can do  How hard is that shot  To make from what  You know about it  The shot that  The Oswald shot  Yeah on Kennedy  It was what  100 yards  200 yards  That's any military guy  Can take that shot  It's not as impossible  As they've made it seem  Over the years  Well I haven't  Examined the angles  And everything else  Right  But now for  Just the distance  Which I think  It's actually only  100 yards or less 
[01:44:00]  Now that's an easy shot  When you  Was there ever a time  When you had to  Shoot somebody  And you looked at them  Through the scope  And it was like  I don't want to do this one  For whatever reason  Definitely  I've passed on  Shots before  There's times  Where you just  You don't think  It's the right thing  To do  So you don't  Take a shot  I passed up a kid  Coming out to pick up  An RPG  I know  My rules of engagement  Said that I was  Supposed to kill this kid 
[01:44:30]  Because it's a  Crew served weapon  RPG  Belt fed  Machine gun  You know  Grenade  Mortars  I'm supposed to  Kill the person  Carrying that  But at that point  Wow  I could not convince  Myself that this kid  Knowing that he's  Going to take it back  Someone else  To use it against me  He's not the one  That's going to use it  So I couldn't  Take that shot  Hopefully you'll deal  With the guy  He hands it off to  And get the better  Side of that deal  Yeah  You said something  Fascinating in there 
[01:45:00]  There's people  Walking around right now  That have no idea  That you've passed up  The shot  I've passed up  A bunch of shots  They don't know  How lucky they are  To be alive  They're just walking  Around right now  Having no idea  That their head was  Or their body mass  Was in a scope  There was also times  Holy shit  Seeing a person  Knowing they're bad  Right  And because of  My rules of engagement  Witness them  Actually commit  Something that  Triggered me hot  But I couldn't  Take the shot  Because when I saw  Them again  They didn't have  The weapon  What triggered me hot 
[01:45:30]  Do you use that  In your  I was allowed  To take the shot  Do you use that  In your  Like regular life  Joking around sexually  When you get  You know  Trigger me hot baby  Live action  Jesus  Keep joking  You're just  Joking around  Yeah  You're joking  My wife is  Kind of sick  Of the military  Trying to leave  The lingo out  Only non-military  Zeroes do that  Military guys  Don't do that  They just fuck  We're the ones  Who want to sound  Like we're real men  There's someone  On the line  I'm using  Trigger me hot 
[01:46:00]  There's someone  On the line  Saying that you  Were in a bar  Fight with Jesse  Ventura  Is that true  Is it  Yes  Oh shit  Oh let's get into this  Yeah I would like to  Do you talk about it  I was going to ask you  How you felt about it  Because we  I don't know  How do you explain  There's a verbal  Altercation in here  But he used to come  On our show  And it was alright  We didn't agree  With a lot of the stuff  He said  But we had  Okay  Thank you for your service  But then we had a moment  Where he walked off  Our show  Because we just  Killed him with knowledge 
[01:46:30]  Yeah we really did  A big argument  Especially Jimmy  We had a big argument  Yeah  Jimmy does a good  Impression of him too  And it was just  Uncomfortable  And he was  Whatever  I wanted to ask  How you felt  About him as a SEAL  But if you had  A bar fight  Were you stressing  The difference  Between when UDT  Or what happened  No no no  Being UDT  I fully respect that  SEALs were born  Out of UDT  So I consider him  Yes he's a SEAL  He's part of the family  I don't draw  A distinction between them  Okay  What happened in the bar  Yeah what happened  You were in a bar 
[01:47:00]  And  Oh Jesus  We had just come back  From our 06 deployment  When we lost our guys  We were having a wake  For the guy who got  The medal of honor  Mikey Monseur  And he happened  To be there  He was coming in  For a graduating  Buds class  That he was going  To speak to  And he was upset  With the war  He doesn't agree  With it  Which is fine  I  You don't have to  Agree with the war  I just get sent there  I don't have to  Agree with politics  I signed up  To serve the country  The country tells me 
[01:47:30]  What to do  He was making it known  That he did not  Agree with it  And I approached him  And said hey  You know  It's not the place  I appreciate it  But we are having a wake  It was the SEAL bar  There in town  I said we're having  The wake here  The family's here  I would appreciate it  If you just kind of  Keep it down  He told us that  We were killing  Innocent people over there  Men, women, children  That we were murderers  And I said  You know what  We can all have  Our differences  That's fine  But please just  Don't upset the family  Yeah  And then he said 
[01:48:00]  That you know  We deserve to lose  A few guys  Holy shit  Jesse said that?  Yes  What the fuck  Is wrong with him?  So by the way  All you guys out there  That attacked me  Because I fucking  Attacked him  Good  I'm glad to hear that  He really is a douche  And what happened  When he said that to you?  Did you grab his ponytail?  No  You slugged him?  Good  I punched him  Good for you  Where'd you punch him?  Bravo  In the face  What happened?  That's when you take a head shot  Well I mean  Jesse Ventura 
[01:48:30]  He's  A big man  He's an older guy  Yeah he's an older guy  Of course all the guys  Then started making fun of me  So what geriatric  You gonna see that today?  When you hit him  Did he hit you back or?  No he  He went down  Oh  Like was he  I don't think he was out  It definitely took him off balance  He went down  But the ref wasn't looking  They never are  Did his walker fall with him?  Yeah  Yeah I think he fell out of his wheelchair  He's a big dude  Wow he went down 
[01:49:00]  He had a big dude  He's a fucking  He's still Jesse the body  I mean he's an older guy  But he's still a big strong guy  Did he awkwardly get up  And have to walk out of the place?  I don't know  I took off running  Because the cops were already outside  And as soon as I hit him  I knew  Seal party  Seal bar  Cops are watching  They saw the whole thing happen  So I took off running  So Jesse Ventura  Said to a SEAL  At a bar  Where there was a wake for a SEAL  You deserve to lose a few guys  Yes he did  Repugnant  You make me even happy  Because he and I  Got into a very very nasty exchange 
[01:49:30]  Because I was  I was defending  Kind of  Al-Qaeda  Yes and I said  You know what  They're nice people Jesse  No I said that  I kind of  Agreed with the Afghanistan  Action  And he was saying  I'm just a guy who didn't serve  Who was for the war  And I'm like  But that's not where I'm coming from  I'm not saying  Fucks  Just go out and fight  It wasn't at all  So we just got into an ugly thing  And it got personal  What an ass  He's a douche  But he really hates my guts  So I'm so happy you did that 
[01:50:00]  Because I'm not a man  Like I couldn't stand up  And punch him  What happened was  As we kept arguing  He patted me on the back  Hard  And I knew he was like  As he was leaving  He's like  Thanks for your service  But it was like one of those  And for me to match him  I would have had to pat it  And I'm like  I'm not going to do what you did  I wish I was him though  How great would that have been  Just to slug him  So I insulted him  Yeah I'm sure I just caught him  Off balance and he tripped  Yeah that must have been it  Sure  Good for you man  That must have been it  I'm so happy  What do you do  You still hunt?  I do  In fact over the holidays 
[01:50:30]  I took my kids hunting  Oh yeah?  That's great  Did you  I'm sure the sniping  Has made you a better  Hunter?  Does it take some  Of the challenge out of it?  No I mean  I still miss deer  I mean like I said  I'm not the greatest shot  In the world  I get lucky at times  But I still miss my deer  At 200 yards at times  Yeah  And well  Deer won't have a  Chinese grenade  And it's a little hoof  So  Does this  When you  What is this book  This book focuses on  Your entire life  Or is it mostly  About the military  Or is it about  Your experiences over 
[01:51:00]  In Iraq?  It's mainly  About my experiences  In Iraq  It has some  Of my upbringing  About being a cowboy  For a living  And then going  Into the military  But it's  Trying to concentrate  On my relationship  With my wife  And the sacrifices  That we went through  As a couple  Not just as  SEAL  But any military  Member would go through  Now you said  You were a cowboy  For a living  Before you went  Into the military  You were like  A cattle rustler  Rustler  That's a hang  In the fence  Was that 
[01:51:30]  Sean Wayne  Is that  From Mexico  And steal cattle  Is that proper terminology  No cattle rustler  Is the guy  That stole the cattle  I meant  Wrangler  Wrangler  Not rustler  Wrangler  Why did you  Just use your hand  To make a lasso  Oh my god  Jimmy just made  A lasso  Move with his hand  I was trying  To  You suck  You're just trying  To relate to that  I was trying  To show him  That he's not  The only one  That is  Experienced  I did do that  By the way  If you would have  Knocked my teeth out  Nobody would have  Faulted you  The only weird part  Is when you were  Doing the lasso  You were moving 
[01:52:00]  Your hips  He wrestles cattle  With a hula hoop  On it  I tied my shirt  In a little knot  Like a prison girl  Where were you brought up  That you were doing that  Brought up in Texas  Born and raised there  Definitely  We always had cattle  And horses  Yeah  I was working on  Ranches all through  High school  Went to college  Kept working on  Ranches  After I quit  College  I decided  I want to be  A cowboy  For a living  Wow  So you were 
[01:52:30]  On a horse  From the time  You were a kid  Though  Yes  I started  Riding early age  See we got  A lot in common  Yeah you kind of  Except you know  I didn't make  Any commitment  Whatsoever  To anything  He would often  Act like a man  And you pretended  You were Popeye  He's living  With somebody  His age  He doesn't have to  Do a big Christmas  Every year  You're obviously  Out of the military  Right  Yes  So what do you do  For a living now  Because you're a young guy 
[01:53:00]  How old are you  37  37  And have all this  Experience behind you  What do you do now  Craft International  Is the name of the company  That we're still  Providing training  To the military  Trying to  You know  I can't be in the military  Anymore  To save my marriage  So this is my way  Of still giving back  Trying to prepare guys  Before they go overseas  And I mean  We're not claiming  To have  Hey you come to ours  And you're gonna  Be 100% successful  But here's a tool  For your toolbox  Maybe it'll come in handy  When you're down there 
[01:53:30]  And we also  Provide security  We do a lot of  The anti-piracy stuff  And personal protection  Here stateside  What is your  What's the most realistic  Would you say  Film that  Featured a sniper  Was it the Hurt Locker  Or was it that scene  The metal jacket  You laughed at the Hurt Locker  Because we thought  That was amazing  That sniper scene  Is that nonsense  He's laughing  I thought that was  A great scene  Well for an EOD guy  To actually be able 
[01:54:00]  To make a sniper shot  Yeah that was  Kind of weird right  It's just a friggin  It's the bomb  Disposed a guy  And he's like  With Barrett  Making the shots  What's a realistic  Sniper scene  Or film  Or at least moment  In a movie  Like wow  That's how it really was  Honestly I think  Most of them  Are all pretty Hollywood  Oh really  If you want to  Take a shot  And have a miss  And start cussing up  A storm  Trying to hurry up  And load another round  To make your shot  That's a little more realistic  And how about  They don't really depict 
[01:54:30]  The time spent waiting  No you'll sit there  Hours maybe days  Maybe you'll go out  And just like hunting  You'll go out  Sit there  And not see a thing  Nothing  Around and come home  Do you have to do calls  Like for deer and moose  Do you have to  Bobby with his reasonable questions  You're an ass  Bobby's a kid  I am a fucking two year old  So wait  Would you be in like  In city situations 
[01:55:00]  Oh definitely  Oh wow  Just laying there  On a rooftop  Wait  What's the longest you waited  Shoot  You know  You might be out there  A week waiting  Just to see something  Depends on what's going on  We've had to  Set up overwatches  Maybe a tank  Just got blown up  We had to set up  Watch it for a couple days  Before the wrecker  Came in to pick it up  There's not  A wrecker on every corner  To pick up a blown up tank  Right right right  So you have to guard it  And make sure they don't take it  Right  And make sure they don't  Drag the bodies  Or whatever it is  They do to  No they already  Policed up the bodies 
[01:55:30]  But it was just  Coming in to make sure  The tank  With all the armor  And everything was intact  That they could take it away  What do they do  With all the stuff  That we're out of Iraq  But what do they do  With all that shit  That they brought over there  Do they bring it all back  I mean  Or do they just  Leave that shit  We left a lot of shit behind  I would assume  Well yeah  Honestly I don't know  I'm assuming that  We're going to bring  Most of it home  But I'm sure we're selling  Or giving some of it  To the Iraqis  I heard in Afghanistan  There's a lot of stuff  From the Russian invasion  Yeah they had to get out  Lickety split  And Jonathan said 
[01:56:00]  When he was out there  In the countryside  He goes  There's areas where  There's just like  Gutted and rusted tanks  And they kind of  Leave that there  As a source of pride  Because they chased  The Russians out  Yeah  Really  And did you ever  Meet a sniper  On the other side  Like you know  They have those  Vietnam movies  Where the snipers  Will meet each other  Yeah Bob's asking  If there was a sniper party  Did you ever meet a sniper  No we never had a  Handshaker shared drinks  You ever met a sniper  From another  Like an enemy  No  You guys met in like  A tube 
[01:56:30]  And said alright  Tomorrow  No it's not quite that  Civilized  Did they have Iraqi  Snipers  Were they good  Because you think  Of the Iraqi army  As just shit  Because they just  Held up a fleet  You guys came in  And they were like  Okay we give up  Were there any good  Iraqi snipers  Yeah there's definitely  Some  There was one  That we were facing  In Fallujah  Who was supposed  To have been  On the Iraqi  Olympic shooting team  Oh really  And one of the guys  On my unit  That was out there  Actually got him  Got him  Have you taken out  Other snipers 
[01:57:00]  There's always  The scenes in the movies  I know this is Hollywood  Where you're looking  Through the scope  And you see the scope  Looking right at you  Have you had that happen  I've never looked  And seen someone  Actually looking back at me  No  But you have seen a guy  Peeking through the scope  And seen the guy  Definitely  Wow  And when you shoot  Somebody from that distance  What do you see  Just like a little  Do you see like  A little mist  Or how much can you see  I mean it depends  On the caliber  You're shooting too  Because those rifles  Have recoil  You may not see anything  You may  By the time you  Reacquire your target  And he's already down 
[01:57:30]  Wow  There was a bounty  On your head  Someone's saying  It wasn't just my head  It was all snipers  But yes  I got picked out  Because of  When we were going  Into houses  They were occupied houses  And they would see  The tattoo on my arm  So it  Oh so they knew  Yeah  Who you were  By the way  You received  Chris received  Three silver stars  And five  Oh I'm sorry  It says two  It says three here  Just we have very shoddy research  Well Jimmy's going to give you  Another one  Yeah  Two silver  Did you get five bronze stars  Or is that wrong  So okay 
[01:58:00]  Wow  What merits a star  What do you do  When they give  Is it a particular target  You hit or  No it's  All the medals  Are supposed to be  For heroism  And stuff like that  But I don't put  Any stock in the medals  It all depends  On the political aspect  At the time  If they feel like  Hey we need to look good  So we're going to give out  Oh  I think they just  Threw my name in a hat  And go  You know what  We're going to give them  A silver  There's no medals  You ever got  That you're like  I like this one  I'm proud of  I mean I  They all have 
[01:58:30]  A little bit of pride in it  But if you were out there  For the medals  Then you're in the wrong place  When you  When you would take the shot  And hit somebody  Would you have to  Or want to  Go up  And check them out  Up close  Or  You definitely  You want to  Okay you want to  But a lot of times  Especially in the city  You can't get out  And expose yourself  And go check them out  That's true  You definitely  You want to go down there  And see what all they have on them  If there's any intelligence  You can pull off of the body  Or anything 
[01:59:00]  That would help you  Down the line  Personally you would want to do that  Not just the team you're with  But personally  Would you want to go  And see what  What damage you did  No  No?  Okay  Yeah I was just curious  As to how  How into  The actual kill  You would  You would get  It's pretty messy  Yeah  I don't care  To go up and examine  That makes sense  How did you deal  With being away  From your  Your wife  And family  For so long  Like what was the longest  You've been away from them  Eight or nine months 
[01:59:30]  Jesus  Yeah you get used to it  It's the job  That's your way of life  But you're out  You're out there a lot  You know  I mean  Jimmy went over there  I went over there  A couple times  And there's guys  That are on the base a lot  And get to use the  You know  They have a lot of  I mean the bases in Iraq  Were  I thought it was going to suck  But they had Skype  And great food  And it was kind of  It wasn't as bad  As you think it would be  But you're not  You know  In there all the time  You're out in the  Out in some fucking house  Waiting for some douche  To walk out with a grenade  You know  So how do you deal with 
[02:00:00]  I mean I get homesick  After a couple weeks  Being on the road  I couldn't imagine  Nine months  Give me space  I'm serious  I know  I do know  But it was just funny  Watching you go through  That process  I wasn't sure  If you were going  To ask a question  You're somehow relating  His being a sniper in Iraq  To the stand up tour  At the Wilbur Theater  You know  Do I understand  What you're saying  Because sometimes  I'll have to stop  At an Arby's  And I don't know  I'm going to be  Away from home 
[02:00:30]  For two days  It's killing me  That's exactly  What I'm saying  Two weeks  For me  Away from home  I'm fucking freaking  I couldn't imagine  Nine months  And then over there  You definitely miss them  My wife would send me  DVDs  So I could see  My kids growing up  And I'd be able  To call  And you try to call  To when everyone's  Going to be awake  And you can actually  Talk to the kids  Or depend on how young  They are  So you can just  Put it there  So you can hear them  Grunt or whatever  That is odd  That they got that now 
[02:01:00]  Like you think back  At World War II  And Korean War  Vietnam  Like imagine having  That type of connection  With your family  Even though it sucks  You're away from them  But having that kind  Of connection  Through Skype  Or something  Back then  Dude over there  I thought it was  Going to be just  Tents and you know  Mud  I mean the mess halls  Yeah  Were fucking  Like a Vegas buffet  Like I mean  It was crazy  I thought me and  Colin  The fatties that we were 
[02:01:30]  Because he was fat  Back then too  We thought we were  Going to starve  So we like brought  Like little  Bars and stuff  Like there's going  To be no food  There was more  I gained 30 pounds  In Iraq  There was  You go to the buffet  There's Chinese food  Mac and cheese  Barbecue  Pizza  Ice cream  You could walk up  To this ice cream  And get as many  Ice cream bars  And sundaes as you wanted  Yeah  Were you privy to that?  No  No  You went to the big  Nice bases  Yeah  Were you Air Force  Bobby  We went over  The Air Force 
[02:02:00]  Had the best food  I think  Oh they do  The Air Force  Was the best base  Ever  They had a fucking  Room with like  Just computers  Pool tables  And like video games  Wow  In the middle of the desert  In the middle of fucking nowhere  Yeah  And then we went to the  Marine base  That had you know  They did have like  Just a tub  Full of shit  That's usually what you eat  Yeah  It was a little weird  It was definitely  It was in the middle of nowhere  20 miles off the Syrian border  I got off the plane  With my two light sticks 
[02:02:30]  Because I was scared  Because it was so dark out  And the guy starts yelling at me  You want to get shot in the head  Put those light sticks away  What are you doing  And that was  Explained why  Other people had handed you  Those light sticks  And said  Look when you get off the plane  Just wave them  Wildly  Call him  Call him  He said  You look like a plane  Landing a plane  But he didn't live like that  He was out in the field  How do you sleep at night  When you're out in the field  In between you know 
[02:03:00]  You learn to sleep  You don't sleep anywhere  But aren't you paranoid  That there's someone around  That could do you some harm  While you're sleeping  You never sleep all at the same time  You do shift work  Oh yeah  You're there with more than one person  Were you ever completely alone  Because the mission  No  Called for it  No  I see  Were you ever close to being captured  Or were you actually worried  Like this is  There's more people  More Iraqis or whatever  Than I was hoping for  Was there ever a moment  Where you thought you might be taken  Not so much a moment  I thought it would be taken 
[02:03:30]  But a moment  That definitely thought  Alright we're not coming out  Of this one  Oh in the shit  As they say  What was that about  What happened  Well I mean  There was  A few instances  But you know  The last one  Was in  Solder City  We went in on a foot patrol  And we wound up being surrounded  And they caught us  In an open air market  And the guys were  On rooftops  And hammering us  And so you guys  Were getting shot  What did you just  Duck behind anything  That was available  Yeah I mean  You were trying to return fire 
[02:04:00]  We called in for extract  And you know  The rangers came flying in  On their strikers  And pulled us out  No kidding  Damn  I gotta ask you a question  You said earlier  You take a shot  In a city  Right  And you're successful  How the hell  Do you guys get out of there  With all your equipment  And everything  You're on a rooftop  Let's say  You made the shot  Guy's dead  How do you get out  Usually you're  What's protocol  Do you call  I don't know  Transportation  Before you take the shot  Or cab  No no  Usually you're gonna stay 
[02:04:30]  For a known amount of time  Unless you're  Really getting hammered  But they're gonna be  Looking for you now  Right  In some instances  Well you're calling  You're usually calling in  For an extract  Someone's coming to pick you up  Right  And what does that entail  Whether it's hummers  Coming in  The strikers  Or bradleys  Anything  You know  Any kind of  Troop carriers  Usually coming to get you  How long from the time  You call in for an extract  Until you get one  Because you might have been  Silent there for a while  That's what I'm saying  And the shot rings out  Right  And everybody knows  Okay that's where they are  How long does an extract  Take from the time 
[02:05:00]  You call it in  It depends on how close  They are  It just varies  Depends on where you set up  For your QRF  Your quick reaction force  If they're gonna be  Five minutes away  Or if they're gonna be  A half hour away  But my point is  Your heart's gotta be  Pounding at that point  You did what you had to do  And now you're just  Waiting to  Wait to get the hell  Out of there  Yeah but  No but I mean  At that point  Yeah yeah yeah  Now you know  Your position  Possibly could be  Given up  And now you're just  Waiting to get the  Hell out of there  To safety  Yeah but I  I was in there  With all my guys  And we were heavily armed  So I knew that 
[02:05:30]  We could fend off  An attack  And my guys  Are definitely  True warriors  And they were  You were probably  Able to take on  A greater number  Of people  Than you were  Like if you had  A group of how many  16 or so  Usually we'd go out  There somewhere  Around 16  Depending on the mission  Where we were going  You could probably  Handle more people  Than that  Coming at you  I think so  Their training  I don't think  They had as good  A training or weapons  As you guys  No we definitely  Had you know  We got technology 
[02:06:00]  On our side  The weapons that we  Had the weapon systems  And of course  The training  Yeah  How close  Did you ever come  Did you get  Were you wounded  Or did you ever  Come close  To where you went  Holy shit  That was close  Well the same night  Where we called in  The extract  I took a round  Across the top  Of the helmet  And one in the back  Oh shit  I thought  Alright this is it  I'm going down  So you got  Shot in the back  In the body armor  Oh okay  Did it penetrate or no  It went through the armor  But it slowed it down  To where it didn't  Go fully into me 
[02:06:30]  Damn  That's fuck shit  The book  Let me promote  The name of the book  We're yapping  Like fucking  A bunch of  Eight year olds  Asking questions  The book is called  American Sniper  Chris Kyle  And the autobiography  Of the most lethal sniper  In US military history  It's just fascinating  We could have you here  All day  And just ask questions  There's something  About a guy like you  Cause you're  Every guy  Like we don't  When guys are playing  Army when we're kids  We're pretending to be you  You know  And here you live 
[02:07:00]  This life  Is it hard  When you come out  To kind of relate  To civilians  And regular people  Because they all  Want to ask you  Questions like this  And anytime  Now everybody's like  Oh I know a SEAL  Or I know a friend  Who knows a SEAL  And so everyone  Now knows a SEAL  Cause SEALs are so  Popular now in the media  But it's definitely  Hard to become  A civilian again  It's a completely  Different way of life  And when you  Have to worry about  Facing life and death  And then you come home 
[02:07:30]  And a civilian's  Day to day stressors  You're looking at it  Going that's stupid  Why are you worried  About that  Yeah  Makes you maybe  A little calmer  In regular life  I mean  Yes and no  Cause in certain ways  You're a little more  Stressed out  Going god  This is stupid  Yeah this is stupid  But I have to deal  With it  And you know  It's stupid  And when you're in  You don't have to  Worry about PC  I mean you offend  Everybody all day long  Cause they're  They're your tight family  And that's how you  Talk to each other  Now that you're out 
[02:08:00]  You have to worry  About everything  I don't know why  People don't understand  That either  Like and that's really  The most primal of  Situations to be in  With people that  Where you can  Call your best friend  A fucking asshole  Or maybe you know  Throw a racial joke  Around with your  Buddies or whatever  But then you have  To come back  And be like  What  What  Why  You know  I was in  A really horrific  Situation  And you know  We were able to  Goof around  With each other  And now I gotta  Deal with these 
[02:08:30]  Dumbass rules  That makes no sense  To me  You guys had a lot  Of rules over there  Too  Like all the  Like the Italians  And the British  And Australia  They could drink  And have women  And the Americans  Couldn't have porn  They couldn't have women  In the same bunks  In the same area  They couldn't have alcohol  I bet they figured it out  Well the Italians  Used to get the  American women  Over to their base  Oh really  Oh yeah  They'd get the  Air force chicks  Who were smoking hot  By the way  And get them over  Because the Italians  Had the custom made  Black outfits 
[02:09:00]  With the shoulder pads  And the berets  Just a hot soldier  A nice cut  Looks like someone's  Paying attention  Yeah really  Jesus  You really gained  A lot of experience  Over there  You know you can eat  As many ice cream bars  As you want  And the Italian  Soldiers are hot  Have good uniforms  You're a disaster  You really are  I have to ask it  I'm embarrassed  To ask this  But where did you poop  That would drive me nuts  No if you're out  In the field though  Like you walk around 
[02:09:30]  The city  You can't find a place  To take a dump  That's a good answer  Most of the restaurants  Won't allow you  To go in  Just poop in a hole  Usually you have  Your MREs with you  And you  You  Crap in the bag  Oh they give a bag  To shit in  Well the MREs  Come in a bag  Usually after you  Eat your meal  You just hang on  To that bag  Those are  Meals ready to eat  Yes  You leave the bag  Behind I hope  Right  You're not  Carrying out  Your own poop  You're supposed  To take everything  Are you serious  You didn't though  Right  So like camping  Camping 
[02:10:00]  You're pooping  Wherever you can  People are shooting  At me  Excuse me  I'm going to  Leave my shit  Someday on a rooftop  Imagine the cranky ass  You would have  On a rooftop  After pooing in a bag  But the beauty  Is somebody's going to  Find a bag of his shit  Six months from now  On a roof  That is kind of  A fucking great feeling  I'd love to do that  Here in the city  Bags of shit  On the apartments  We're just getting  Stupid at this point  Are you doing any signings  Thank you man  Yes I am  I'm actually  The first one's  Going to be in  Dallas on the 9th  Do you have  Maybe your publisher  Somebody has  To promote  Some of your signings 
[02:10:30]  Do you guys want  To go out  And meet Chris  And get a book signed  Yeah absolutely  Fascinating  Talking to you  Yeah absolutely  The book looks  Unbelievable  I wish I had  More time to read it  Good sense of humor  I was trying to  Portray my actual  Personality in the book  To show people  That I am just  An average guy  I like to cut up  And don't take  Myself too serious  And there's so many  Guys out there  That are a lot  Better than me  So I'm not trying  To portray myself  As the world's  Greatest sniper  I just happen to be  In certain situations  And I made some 
[02:11:00]  Lucky shots  And came out okay  Do you find  What's worse  Than regular civilians  Who you know  And never did military service  Trying to relate to you  On that level  Like you know  We'll ask questions  Shamelessly  Like girls  But when a guy  Tries to  Like girls  But I mean  How insulting is that  When a guy tries  To relate to you  Like he knows  And he has no idea  What he's talking about  You get it every day  You just get used to it  You do right  Yeah it's  I mean everybody's curious 
[02:11:30]  There's certain areas  Of life that I don't  Have any experience with  That I'm sure  I annoy the hell  A lot of people  Keep asking questions  About that  But you could snap  Their neck  Yeah  He's a sniper  He's not a kung fu expert  Well look  You know what  He kind of looks like  He could be  You know  Martial arts training  Yeah why don't you  Challenge him Bobby  To what  Exactly  I'll do  We could snap  Your neck  I'll beat him  An xbox  That barracks  Ice cream eating  That you were talking about  Yeah  I was over there 
[02:12:00]  I had two milkshakes  One of the marines  Goes  You're going to have  Both of those fatty  So I gave him one  And then my other one fell  I had to go back  And get two more  You asshole  That's fantastic  But do you know  When you walk out  With two milkshakes  The other guys  Probably look at you  And go  That's what we're  Fighting for  And then they all  Deserting  That's why they call it  Deserting  Bobby  Bobby was deserting  You just put it together 
[02:12:30]  You just put it together  Alright let's get Chris out  He's a very busy  Chris thanks so much  Thank you very much  And when we come back  From break  We'll plug the book signings  Too if they have them  Yes  Yes of course  I would like to get people  Out to your signings  American Sniper  Looks really great man  And again you know  It might sound hokey  But it is true  Thank you so much  For what you've done  Over the years  That you were over there  I appreciate it  It was my honor  Serving this country  And my honor  And serving with  All the heroes  I was with 
[02:13:00]  It's easy to look good  When you're surrounded  By heroes  That's exactly the problem  The opposite problem  We have in this room  I was just going to say  There's no one  To look up to  Wish we had those  Problems in here  But we're all zeros  It's easy to look bad  When you're surrounded  By zilchers  That's our philosophy  Chris Kyle everyone  Thank you Chris  Thank you  We'll be right back  And now 88 seconds  Of former Minnesota governor  Professional wrestler  And Navy SEA  Jesse Ventura  Talking crazy  And go

[02:31:00]  It's kind of like  The only thru way  To get that way though  So they just basically  Sit there  And there's no other  Real revenue source there  So it's basically like  Let's get the  At the speed limit  Way lower than it should be  And it also switches  It goes 55-65  Every 200 yards  They just want to get you  Nothing worse than  When you tell them  Who you are  And they go  Yeah I heard you  And they still  Have you had that?  Oh yeah  There is something worse than that  No I haven't heard of you  Oh Bob Kelly  We got that too of course  But when they heard of you  And they still want to  Just get you  Well I've gotten in trouble  For trying to impersonate 
[02:31:30]  Donald Trump  They're like  This is a joke  This is  I'm like really  That's what the juniors were  Like come on guys  You've got to do better than that  Well they don't believe  That you are who you say you are  I have that a lot  Like if I'm in jeans and a t-shirt  Everyone assumes like  You know that I'm going to be  In a suit all the time  It's like  I wear that to work  But like I'm a pretty low-key guy  On my free time  Have you gone to the Roscoe Festival?  You know what?  I haven't been up there for that  Oh it's terrific  I know  I've heard it's great  Bobby was put in the local gym  Nice  Hey  When do we get to go fly fishing again? 
[02:32:00]  May I'm hearing right?  Yeah May  Is that when you start?  You can go April 1st basically opens up  But it's kind of cold  It can be miserable if you're  Rich was so bummed  Because he took us on  That experience was awesome  But the water was way too fucking high  So it was almost impossible  For idiots like me and Bobby  But the boat went in front of us too  Which I found out  There's a boat that went in front of us  His boss  And they were catching 23 inches  With Kenny Tutalo I guess  Yeah  They caught everything  And then we didn't get shit  We're going real local  And I'm sorry  Roscoe locals  I have kind of a good arrangement 
[02:32:30]  One of my good friends  You know for 10 years  As a guide up there  I basically when I built my cabin  I bought a drift boat  I was like  He was like  Well can I use your boat?  So I said sure  You know just use it to guide from  And so basically  I have a guide whenever I want  That's just  Because he's just like  When you're up there I'll float you  Like that's kind of our arrangement  It works out perfectly  We only caught one fish  And it was this big  Oh god  I'm so excited  It was six inches  But he didn't catch it  He accidentally caught it  He was walking in the water  Trying to go to a point  With the guy  And I was dragging  The one goofy bastard  Dragging the fly in the water  Behind him  And there was a fish on it 
[02:33:00]  And people don't understand  How almost impossible that is  To do  Yeah it doesn't happen often  Would you just gill hook it?  I don't know  It didn't even bite it  And suddenly go  Bobby I got a fish  Yeah there's a hook  In the fish's anus  Hey well take what we can get  On those slow days  Bobby was mad  I was pissed  We didn't catch one  We didn't even get a bite  We never saw bubbles  We saw nothing  Well by the way  It happens up there  I mean it can be great  I mean I've had 30 fish days  And I've had you know  The big skunk  Like so  When it's good  And you hit it right 
[02:33:30]  It's good  But you have to  You have to go up there  And I'm trying to get  These guys to go  I'm telling you  I went as a goof  With Bobby  And I loved it  But we should get  Anthony to go  But can you shoot  Is there a shooting fish section?  You know I'm a gun fanatic as well  So you know  I shoot competition high power  I'm on a team  I'm sponsored  Like you know  Wow that is great  My teammate just won  Camp Perry this year  So we do a lot of that  So if you ever want to get out  We'll get out there  And blow some stuff up  That's what we should do  We have a fly fishing weekend  You can shoot guns  And Jimmy you can come up  And you can 
[02:34:00]  And do something  You can make  We can make fun of you  No we get young girls  I couldn't think of  Something less appealing  Than upstate New York  I really couldn't  But there's got to be  An activity for you up there  There's not  Carving  No  You're like making soap  I'm not an outdoorsy guy  Yes  I want to do scrimshaw  On the weekend  While you're all out  Having fun  We just want to  We just want to stay  With you next time  Because we got woken up  By roosters  At 4.30 in the morning  Literally I'm 15 minutes from  I guess you stayed over  With Tutala's place  So like yeah  I'm 15 minutes north 
[02:34:30]  We used to stay  At the Roscoe Motel  But we got kicked out of it  Last time  By the way that's a feat  It's hard to get kicked out  You know what you have to do  To get kicked out of it  There was no  They had no customers  We were the only customers  On the books  And she said  Get the fuck out  She recognized me  From a dumb video I posted  And she's been waiting  For me to reach her  Because they had the pool  And now it's a garden  It's a vegetable garden  And she got insulted  They can sustain their  Live because there's nobody  Buying rooms  So they have to grow  Their own food 
[02:35:00]  But she was insulted  I point out that  Her pool was shitty  Yeah  Well that's  You know listen  If you did that  To one of our hotels  I probably wouldn't  Have you back either  But take down the fence  Around the pool  So it doesn't still  Give the illusion  That a pool  Used to be there  Take the diving board  Out of the garden  What we should do  For you though  Is get you up there  In the fall  And we do the  Cast and blast  Where you bring  The 12 gauges along  And do some duck hunting  Along the way  While you're fishing  Oh is that it  While you're fishing  It's kind of aggressive  Are you allowed to do that  I'm not sure 
[02:35:30]  But I  I may or may not  Have done it in the past  So  The beauty of the  Statue of limitations  But just so you can explain  The beauty of that river  You put your fucking boat  And you see nobody  Because it's really hard  To access that river  You don't realize  That you're not  In the middle of Colorado  I mean it's  It's a pretty serene place  But for the areas  Where you're passing  Along the highway  Yeah  Yeah  But nobody can get on  Not too many people  Can just get on that river  Well you can  I mean there's public access  You just have to know it  You know  It's to kind of  If you come from New York  And you just say  Hey I'm going to go do this  Like it's not that easy 
[02:36:00]  But once you know it  You know  I've been up there for years now  So you know  It's pretty easy  And if the water's high  Just go up further  You can still  You know  Get into some good stuff  So where do you put the key  Under the rock  Is there a rock  What do we do  How do we get to the rock  We'll figure it  We'll work something out  Oh that's a great question  Bob  I like that  Now Rich was so bummed  Because I know he knows  What he's doing  And he's like  You'll never talk to me again  I'm like  We're going to use you next time  Hey you know those guys  Is that the Andretti guy  Of course  Yeah we know those guys  So you're here to talk  About Celebrity Apprentice  I hear you don't have much time 
[02:36:30]  Because it's a big  Press day for you guys  Oh you know  Listen I have more fun here  Probably than I will  Wherever they all else  They have me going  So I'm willing to stay  And hopefully other people  Will work with your guys  Schedule you  We saw  Dee Snider walked by  Yeah  And Clay Aiken walked by  And they're on the show  I guess  Yes they are  This season  Who else is on  Lisa Lampanelli  Lisa Lampanelli  So you know  You got  Let's see  Aubrey O'Day  You have a lot of  You know  It's an eclectic crowd  As always  Yeah it sounded it  Definitely  There's going to be  Some confrontations 
[02:37:00]  There's some  There's some really  Good confrontation  I mean you don't have  Some of the crazy  That you had with  Gary Busey last year  Which was just  You know  Just nonsensical  Like where  You don't even know  Where you're going  And yet entertaining  Yeah  It's a lot more cerebral  You have a lot more  Intelligent kind of people  Battling it out  Pendulet  So you know  You have some  You have some really  Interesting intelligent people  And it's nice  To this day  We obsess about our pal  Andrew Dice Clay  He's friends with all of us  And we're like  Will you just fucking behave  And stay on this show  He couldn't do it  I know  Because he would have  Gave you guys great TV  It would have been  Great material  But honestly 
[02:37:30]  The show is  You know  People don't see it  They see two hours  On TV on a Sunday night  And they don't realize  That those guys  Are in there 24-7  You know  For weeks at a time  And it really wears on you  And you can see it with Dice  Like as funny as he is  It's hard to be on  And be on camera  Yeah  24-7  It wears you down  And it tires you out  And you see it a lot  With the athletes  The guys  You know  The performers  And the comedians  And the guys  That are used to  Doing what you guys do  Get them on stage  And you go for hours a day  And it's not really scripted  You know  Those guys do a little bit better  The athletes  You know  They burn out fast  And some people  Just don't have that ability  Once you get tired 
[02:38:00]  And sick of it  It's a miserable place to be  You don't really want to be there  It's work  Yeah  You know  For me with Dice  It seemed like he just  Wanted out of there  You know  You can see that  You know  It's too bad  Because yeah  I mean  He's a funny bastard  So that would have been  Good to see  Yeah  Definitely  Oh boy  Should we bring in  Mr. Andretti as well  Yeah sure  Who are we looking at  This year on Celebrity Apprentice  Besides the cast  Who's going to be  The standouts you think  Well listen  I mean  I kind of know  Who some of the standouts  Are going to be  But you know  You're going to see  Some obviously  Some good stuff from Lisa  You're going to see 
[02:38:30]  Some great stuff  From Arsenio  From Clay  Really  Aubrey O'Day  You know  Kind of young and smart  And you know  Feisty people  So you know  You got some great  You know people there  But you know  You see it obviously  From Michael  And it's just such  A diverse group  And that's what  Everyone's like  Who would you ever want  On the show  Who would be the best person  It's like  I don't care about  Any one individual  It's really how  They interact as a group  And when you have  People that are just  You know  From such different places  You know  Yeah yeah  That's when you get  Some of the  You know  You get a guy  Like Paul Tuttle  You know  In a team  With a guy 
[02:39:00]  Like Clay Aiken  And he's like  Come on  Like what could  Possibly go right  Which is perfect for us  It's kind of amazing  Who's Paul Tuttle  From Orange County  Choppers  Paul Senior  The dad from  American Choppers  Who has a temper  Oh god that should be fun  He's going to snap  We've had him on the show  He's pretty intense  Yeah yeah  How did you find  Your celebrity experience  Michael  On the celebrity  I gotta tell you  It was a great  Great experience  You know  It was quite interesting  Like Donald was saying  You know 
[02:39:30]  The diversity of  People there  Is just amazing  And when you put them  All in the same room  One thing I can say  Is everyone  Was very competitive  And when everybody's  Competitive like that  It gets pretty crazy  And there was some  Crazy moments there  And  But overall  It was a lot of fun  Doing it so far  And  It's been  I've met some  Great guys  That I think  Are going to become  Friends  You know  For a long time  So  Which has been great  A bunch of  Weird people too 
[02:40:00]  I'm sure  There may be a couple  Weirdos in there  Come on  What would reality  Television be  Without some weirdos  You know  That sounds like  Quite the batch  Is it hard to get  Psyched up for competition  After having raced  I mean  Anything else  Just kind of seems  Soft compared to that  Right  Yeah  It's all different  You know  It's a different  Type of competition  But  You know  I think  Once you get  Into any situation  Whether I'm  You know  Playing tennis  Or doing something  Like this  Your competitive  Juices come out  And you get 
[02:40:30]  Into it pretty much  Yeah  I think you see  That with all of them  I mean  Everyone's kind of  Been great at  Whatever it is  That they do  So you put them  In a situation  Where maybe they're  Out of their comfort zone  And you know  That competition  That kind of spirit  Still is there  But it's great  When you see someone  With that spirit  But has no idea  What's going on  Because it's a total  Disaster  It's awesome  Yeah I guess it is  Nice to watch people  Kind of fall apart  Right  I mean you know  You're used to  Someone that's  So in their comfort zone  On stage  Or whatever it is  But you get them  To do a marketing task  Or you get them  To do whatever  It may be  That they're doing  And you know  All of a sudden  It's not so easy  That and you know  Again a lot of 
[02:41:00]  These people have  Their assistants  And they're people  That are doing  All of these little  Kind of menial tasks  For them  And all of a sudden  You're saying  Hey congratulations  Go do this  You saw Rod Blagojevich  I mean the guy  Didn't know how  To send an email  It's kind of amazing  You know  You take away  That support network  And you know  It makes for  Some interesting stuff  That's very true  Have you seen  Have your view  On celebrities  Changed at all  Since this  Like because I tend  To find a lot of them  When you talk to them  They rely too heavily  On their publicists  And I was like  Oh what a dope  This guy is  Like they have  Nothing interesting to say  You know what  I don't know  That my views  This has changed  But I've seen  A much bigger extreme 
[02:41:30]  You're kind of  One way or the other  They're the people  That are just  Totally competent  They could do it  They've just said  Hey it's easier  To not have to do  Some of those things  And then there's  The people that  Really can't function  Without the support group  And you kind of see  A huge dichotomy  Between that  It's kind of  Interesting to watch  Because you see them  Again in their  Comfort zone  It's like man  That person really  Has their stuff together  But you take them  Out of that  And some people  Thrive and some  People totally fail  Yeah  Why did they switch  From at one point  It was just the apprentice  And that's no longer  And it's only  Celebrity apprentice  Was the apprentice  Having a hard time  Were people just  More interested  In the celebrity angle 
[02:42:00]  I think once he went  Celebrity it was  Kind of hard to go back  You know everyone  Has either a fan  That they really  You know they like  That person  Or they want to see it  Them they want to see  That dichotomy  To go see it  You know us scream  At like some 22 year old  Kid that doesn't know  Anything it's just  Not quite the same  Once you've seen them  All explode on each other  Yeah you know the people  Going into it  Yeah exactly  With these other reality shows  You really got to get  Into the person  And get to know them  Yeah that's it  There's people that are like  Bring back regularly  We want to really see it  I just don't know that  You know in terms of  The overall group  The overall demo  I think people really  Yeah I think people  Love seeing the celebrities 
[02:42:30]  Taken out of their element  Yeah  And dumped in with a bunch  Of other people  Who did the Chicago hotel  Uh me  I loved it  I went out there one time  And I stayed there  We talked about it  Last time you were here  Yeah  One of the best buildings  I've ever been in  Thank you  I spent about three days  A week in Chicago  Basically commuting  From the city  For about three years  To get that thing built  It was amazing  I was dying to stay in there  And I went out there  I had something to do  And I fucking loved it  Why did you love it though  What makes it so spectacular  It just looks brand new  Yeah  Everything is well done 
[02:43:00]  The views are great  I mean I just  I couldn't wait to tell you  How much I loved it  I appreciate it  Well Trevor and Leisure  Gave it the best hotel  In North America  So one of the best in the world  So I was kind of psyched  About that  I didn't go to the Spock  Better than the Roscoe Motel  That's a good question  As a builder  How do you build something  Nowadays where in the future  It's still going to look brand new  You know what I mean  You know listen  You see a lot of that  Obviously you see  You know  Look at the architecture  From the 60s  At Kennedy  Right  There's things that are timeless  And that you can kind of make  You know  And there's things that aren't 
[02:43:30]  And you got to be able  To really figure out  What that trend is  And some things  You know  Will always stay timeless  And you just gotta  You know  You have to understand architecture  You have to understand  What people want  You have to understand  You know  The area in which you're building  So it kind of  Is contextual  So it kind of fits  Within the environment  That you're constructing  And you know  And you go from there  And hopefully  You get it right  Right now  Glass is in  Obviously  Correct  All these buildings  Look like just big  Huge glass buildings  Yeah but I don't  I don't ever see a time  Where brick will be back in  You know  There may be components of it  But I mean  Ultimately  Today with modern glass 
[02:44:00]  There's an energy efficiency to it  It's not like you're wasting  You know  Before you did a lot less glass  Because you wasted a lot of energy  Trying to heat or cool a place  You know  Who doesn't  And who isn't in the future  Going to want to have  Floor to ceiling glass  You know  Better views  Especially with a building like that  Where you stand  So high above everything else  I mean  You know  That kind of makes sense  So that's obviously a natural trend  That's probably not going anywhere  When are you going to take tubs  Just get rid of the tub  Nobody uses a tub  Whenever you decide to leave  I'll be asked that question 
[02:44:30]  I mean  Nobody uses a tub  It's a good point  People don't use them  I use tubs  People don't use them often  I really do  They expect if I fixed your bathroom  Which includes a tub  And you certainly can't do the tub shower  So it's sort of expected as a trend  And you know  Maybe that'll go away  And then you know  Maybe you're there with your girlfriend  And you say  Hey you know  Maybe the tub's a good idea at the time  So  Yeah but nobody  You can't fit two people  In one of the tubs  You can't in those tubs  There were pretty big tubs over there  I don't know if I  Look at me  That's the definitive word  Look at me  Look at me  You can't fit  Well  Listen there's exceptions 
[02:45:00]  To every rule  I can't help that you can't fit in the tub  I can fit in the tub  Would you throw him out of the pool  With you in the soap  What  What did you say  You have to do it in the swimming pool  Okay  You know what  I love walking showers  When you go to a hotel  You have a walking shower  I love it  With the bench  And the five shower heads  That's  And the four guys  That scrub you with the brushes  That's  Like Shamu  Trump Jumor  Making fat jokes about me  I figure if there's a venue  I can get away with it  I drop some of those things on Twitter 
[02:45:30]  And 4,000 people drop me  In about a second  Because they're worried  About me making a fat joke  The worst thing you could ever hear  From your chick is  Oh  Donald Trump Jr.'s following me  That's what happened  My girl's like  Oh  Donald Trump Jr.'s following me  Well I think you retweeted something of hers  Which is pretty funny  I mean she's a truly sick individual  And I appreciate that  That is kind of what's good about you on Twitter  It seems to me you would be more PC on Twitter  And you're not 
[02:46:00]  Honestly I don't care  You see it when I'm hearing  I really don't care  And it's kind of you know  So much of what I say on the show  As Michael can attest to  Like you know  Basically gets edited out  But I'm basically myself  But you know  NBC probably regulates me a little bit more  And I end up on the cutting room floor  But like  I am what I am  I don't really care  You know  Because you don't care  Because you don't  You have don't care money  I don't know if it has anything  To do with it  Maybe  Maybe  I don't know if it has anything  To do with it  But I think  Life's a lot easier  You know  You grow up with parents  Like  We're all pretty outspoken alpha people  So if I'm thinking something  Like I'm not going to sit there 
[02:46:30]  And worry that much  About what anyone else thinks  I don't like it  They don't have to follow me  I really don't care  He's got to be pretty good too  I would think so  Hey he's like  It doesn't suck  Different level  Different level  But  Well your dad's not a PC guy either  I mean he kind of speaks his mind  And says what he wants  Regardless of people  You know  We finally had him back on the show  Yeah so you know  You're brought up with those genes  And you know  With that kind of level of nurture  And you know  You're probably not going to get someone  That toes the line on everything  Like oh  You know  I'll say what I think  And I mean  I probably take it a little further 
[02:47:00]  Than I would on Twitter  You know  Than I would on Oprah  Or you know  Some other thing  But like  You know  There's a place  Where I can be  In a business mentality  And I'm able to step away  From that  And kind of be myself as well  So you know  There's a time and a place  For everything  But life's too short  To be you know  A stiff all the time  Where are you at  With the primaries  At this point  Oh listen  You know  Listen  Obviously I've got to cage  Some of my thoughts  Depending on what my father does  But you know  I think  You really think  He might still do this  I don't know  You know  I have been  On vacation  Trying to avoid it  A little bit  He's great at teasing it 
[02:47:30]  But listen  He's great  And I think he'd be great  For the country  I mean you see  Kind of  What you got from last night  Obviously there's kind of  A three way tie  Which means there's no one  That's really that satisfied  With anyone  You still have  You know  All this noise  From the kind of  Bachman, Huntsman  You know  Gingrich crowd  Even and you know  I think  Iowa's not necessarily  Representative of the rest  Of the country  I mean I'd say  It's probably  Slightly more conservative  Than you know  Just about everywhere else  And so  I don't know  That it means  All that much  But you know  Really for me  At this point 
[02:48:00]  Given kind of  You know  The ineptitude  That we've seen  Over the last three years  And given  You know  The lack of action  And the utter failure  That we've experienced  Over the last three years  Like I'm voting for anyone  Who has the best chance  Whether it's the person  I want or not  The guy who has  The best chance  Of beating Obama  Like these guys  Are like  Well we gotta vote  On this one issue  Because we're Republicans  You know  It's so stupid  In the Republican Party  Like you have to be  Like right of Genghis Khan  To get the nod  But then you have to  Come back in center  You know  To get the actual election 
[02:48:30]  Which in and of itself  Makes you a freaking hypocrite  Which is like  My least favorite thing  In the world  So you know  I'm for  Like the guy  Who's most likely  To be able to beat that  Because what we've done  Now isn't working  Like it was a great experiment  Like give someone  With no experience  Who's young  And has a good line of shit  Like give them  Give them the presidency  Like give them nukes  Like that's a great  Freaking idea  Like we needed that  As a country  But now that we've got  That out of our system  Like  Now that we've got that  Out of our system  Like maybe give it to someone  Who actually could do something 
[02:49:00]  Who didn't like collect signatures  For a living  Before being a half term senator  And going on to the presidency  Like you know  That's  It's great  Like I'm glad we did it  I think we needed it  Probably as a country  You know  It's not necessarily  Who I voted for  But I think we need it  As a country  You know  Now that we've got it  Out of our system  Like come on  Like let's go with someone  Who can actually  Effectuate change  And not just like  Run on a campaign  Of freaking hope  Like what's hope  Like let's sit back  On our ass  Do nothing  And hope  Maybe something will happen  That's fucking phenomenal  Like you know 
[02:49:30]  Come on  Do you think  I'm in the middle of Obama  I like him sometimes  I don't like him other times  By the way  I think he's probably  A really likable guy  Like he's a guy  You'd maybe want to have a beer with  But for the politics  But I'm surprised  And we talked to your dad  About this too  How he's been  Foreign policy wise  He's a lot tougher  Than I thought he was going to be  He's a lot more  Republican  With foreign policy  Than I thought he would be  As far  It started with  Allowing the 30,000 troops  I think that  McChrystal asked for 
[02:50:00]  I think it was McChrystal  Even though he didn't do it  As fast as he wanted  But again  The problem I have with that is  He got elected  On a platform  That was totally opposite of that  So when he realized  The country wasn't  He's like  Okay well I'm going to change  But if you look at  Like the 15 points he ran on  Yeah  He hasn't tried to effectuate  Any one of those  The one he actually managed  To push through  Was healthcare  And by the time he got done  Bastardizing what he originally  Wanted to get it through  It was unpopular  With 80% of the country  And when you think about  80% of the country  As a statistic  Like elections are won 
[02:50:30]  On like .02%  Romney beat Santorum  By 8 votes  Like that's how close we are  From a certain perspective  In this country  On politics  Right  So to be unpopular  With 80% of the nation  Is almost statistically  Impossible to achieve  But you raised  You raised a good point though  Which is  He did say something  About not committing  More troops  And then he did  What's the line  These guys have to walk  Between being wishy-washy  And staying married  To the polls  And honestly  Getting more information  And going  You know what  I said something 
[02:51:00]  What I said wasn't correct  I'm going to do this  Because it's better  For the country  Like that's almost  A no win for a politician  Well you know  Listen there's no question  I mean there's  There's always the catch-22  You know in politics  But I think ultimately  You know the number one thing  You want to see  From your president  Is conviction  Whether you like  George W. Bush or not  You knew where he stood  Yeah  You know there was no like  Middle ground  You understood what he wanted  Maybe you disagree with it  Maybe you liked it  You know I probably disagree  With it more often than not  Even as a conservative  But like you knew  Where he stood  So to be able to say  Well I don't know  I don't know that Obama's 
[02:51:30]  Really just in touch  With the average American  I think he's got a mindset  Where he wants to be  Right  But it's not really in line  With you know  The average American  I mean you know  It's just different  I just think he's been  A little bit tougher  Than I thought he was going to be  I was worried that his foreign policy  Was going to be horrendous  Like I was going to be nervous  Like I felt safe  Look at what he's done  With Israel and some of these  I mean you know  I wouldn't say his foreign policy  Has exactly been strong  I think he's probably been  A little bit more hawkish  Than anyone would have  Ever thought  But I don't know  That I'd give him full credit  On foreign policy  Well I mean the fact  That he's like  Al-Walaki 
[02:52:00]  Like he allowed him  To be targeted  And people didn't agree  Honestly  Because everyone gave him  Credit for the Osama bin Laden  Yes he's the president  Whoever's sitting in that  But like honestly  Like who isn't  Pushing that button  Exactly  Like  Oh really we got  Osama bin Laden  Like you know  Let's go tell the Pakistanis  You know the fact  That he deliberated it  For 17 hours  Or something like that  Whatever he said  Yeah  A lot of people wouldn't have  And again  I don't know the situation  So maybe I'm talking  Out of my ass  But like  You know  I can't think of  A single person  In this country  In the world  That's not  You know  Muslim extremist 
[02:52:30]  That wouldn't have been like  Go  Yeah  Like if you didn't  Like that's like  If you didn't do that  That's like treasonous to me  Right  But he had to do that  No no  Emotionally we all go with that  But this is not just  We found him in Afghanistan  This was  We think  He is in the country  Of an ally  Of a nuclear power ally  Correct  Who we give billions of dollars to  I hate Pakistan  If they don't like it  We can stop giving them the money  I agree  You know what  Fine  We'll invade your airspace anyway  And we won't give you  The billions of dollars  And you can keep complaining 
[02:53:00]  And go to  Total hell in a handbasket  So you know what  Like I don't know  It's not a ballsy call to make though  For them to be upset about that  It's not an easy call  Like it's not a ballsy call to make  I mean to me it's a no brainer  But again  I agree with you  There's the people that say  Well constitutionally speaking  It's  I don't know  I make an exception  It's fucking been lying  If there's an exception  That proves the rule  It's that  What if he wasn't there  This is my argument  What if he wasn't there  And they just basically  Fired bombs into a compound  And invaded a compound  Where they thought he was  And he wasn't 
[02:53:30]  That to me was the risk  Was that he went into  A  Believe me  These guys have pretty good intel  When they're doing something like that  They have pretty solid intel  Hey Clinton thought he had him  Clinton thought he had him  And he bombs into empty space  Well no  But Clinton also chose not to have him  When he actually did have him as well  So you know  So there  A guy who wouldn't have pulled the trigger  Yeah but also  Well different circumstances  That was also before 9-11  It was before  I mean you gotta remember  This is a guy that we trained  To fight the Russians  Like this isn't  You know  It was a little bit different  Post 9-11  And post all the other things  That have happened  You know in the last 10 years  Like it's just a different world 
[02:54:00]  And he was a different guy  Yeah but we're still soft though  In the sense that  Even though it's post 9-11  People are more politically correct now  Than they were before 9-11  Oh but that's because  That's  I mean because  If you say the stuff  Like I've been saying  For the last 10 minutes  Which I'm sure I'll be killed by  You know  Actually your viewers  Will probably be cool  But like  If the transcript gets out  You know the ACLU  I'll be like  You know  I'll be like  They're bin Laden  You know  But like  It's just  It's a different world  And now  You know  We're really getting to the point  Where it's difficult  For people like us  Who do speak their minds  Because we don't care 
[02:54:30]  I mean  So many people  You know  They're just worried about  You can't say something  Bad about Obama  Not because  You actually have  A strong stance  Against his platform  But because that makes you a racist  Like that in and of itself  Is racism  Like it's so  You know  It's so ridiculous  And that's where we've become  And he's played that card  Very well  And by the way  If I was in his shoes  I'd be playing that card too  Because you can get away with it  In this country  And we allow it  He's been playing it  Holder's been playing it  Yeah everyone  It's impossible to criticize anybody  Based on their actions  Well that's the media  That does that  And the media 
[02:55:00]  Plays the race card  Probably faster than he did  When did he not play it  With the whole  Well listen  He called Bill Clinton racist  You know  There was something  There was some case  Where I thought he was going to play it  And he didn't  But the media plays it for him  So I mean  Well listen  However you get the advantage of it  And listen  Don't kid yourself  There's a strong PR presence  Behind that  Influencing  The press corps  And these things  So whether he's the one saying it  Or whether it's  Someone in the background  Saying hey  Maybe this is a good idea to say  Someone's playing that card  Right  I find myself defending him  On foreign policy though  Not on domestic stuff  But I find myself 
[02:55:30]  Hey Jim  I didn't realize you were a commie  That's nice  I'm more impressed  Hey  I'm just kidding  I'm just kidding  I love the fact  That he allowed  An American citizen  Who should have been killed  To be targeted  I love the fact  That he basically  Fucked Pakistan  That's what he said  And I love the fact  That he said that  And Bush  Who's an arch-conservative  Was as much a fucking  A whore to the  Middle East oil money  As a lot of them are  Holding hands in the garden  I don't even know  If Bush would have  Pulled the trigger like that  And gone into Pakistan  Bush would have 
[02:56:00]  Pulled that trigger  I don't know about that  I don't have as much faith in that  You know what though  You're giving him credit  For foreign policy  When you should only  Give him credit for  You know  Like you said  Being a little hawkish  Yeah  I like that  That's not a foreign policy  I mean  It's part of  It's part of your foreign policy  But I mean  He's been awful  At going over to other countries  And actually talking  With other leaders  Without coming off  Like a pansy  Yeah  You're right  I like that aspect  Of his foreign policy  I like the fact  That he's been brutal  In ways I never thought  He would be brutal  I like his foreign policy 
[02:56:30]  When it's done via drone  Absolutely  Any foreign policy  Done via missile  Is awesome with me  Like I'm good with that  Peace through superior firepower  That's fine  Now let's see what happens  In the Gulf  With the Iranians  Popping a little shit  About our ships being our village  Yeah that'll be fun though  I think we can end that  Pretty quickly  Oh yeah yeah  That kind of posturing  Is just a joke  Like these guys  Don't want to get in that battle  Like  They got a few cruisers  Over there  With some missiles and stuff  And they're staring  At some aircraft carriers  I don't think they're going to try  To  I have some buddies  On F-18s  That are just waiting  Yeah  Chomping at the bit 
[02:57:00]  To get in that one  I think  Would they love to shoot  A few of those ships  How do you think a guy  Like Ahmadinejad  Should be handled  Like  He's a rough one  The problem with handling him  Is  I don't know that you can even  Like  You're not dealing with  A rational individual  I mean  You're clearly dealing  With a maniac  So I don't know  That you can handle him  You know  I think you gotta try  I think you gotta make efforts  And then I think  There's a point  Where you just gotta say  Enough is enough  And I mean  I think this is one of those battles  If we don't do it  Israel's probably gonna take care of it  I mean these guys  Are enriching uranium  At a pace that no one's  Ever seen before 
[02:57:30]  You know  The guy is clearly out of his mind  And I'm not just saying that  As an American  Because he disagrees with us  But I mean  He's a freaking wacky  But is he crazy  Or is he just a smart  Well by the way  He's also playing the PR side  You know  For the Middle East  But listen  To make the radicals happy  Because he hasn't done anything  He's talked a lot of shit  But he hasn't done anything  But Iran in the Middle East  Isn't necessarily  The same  You know  It's not like  Other Middle Eastern  Radical countries  I mean  They're disliked in their own way  By other countries  In the Middle East  It's not like  They're one of them  And you know  They'll take the upside of that 
[02:58:00]  But there's also  A negative there  I think Israel's got  Great intelligence  As far as  And they handle that stuff  So much better than us  Because they don't worry  About the BS that we do  They don't care  If they do see  That Iran is very close  To getting a bomb  That could strike them  They will take them out  Who did they kill in Dubai?  Somebody from Hamas  I think they killed  I love the operation  They ran in Dubai  Somebody from Hamas  Was it  I don't know the guy's name  I wouldn't make up  A Middle Eastern name  It was somebody in Dubai  Mohammed something  He had a beard 
[02:58:30]  He wasn't nice to his wife  We only have a few minutes  Left  Definitely want to make sure  We get the word out  For Celebrity Apprentice  Just so you know  And it's February 12th  At 9 o'clock on NBC  And you can also  Follow Donald  Are we a month out still?  Why are you doing press or  Yeah I don't know  But that's weird  Might as well  Whatever  I'll come back on  As an airs if you want  Come back when it's  Right around the corner too  Donald J. Trump Jr.  Not Donald Trump Jr.  Donald J. Trump Jr. 
[02:59:00]  Well you know  I didn't set it up originally  I was like  You couldn't have picked  Something shorter  Like Don Trump  So someone set it up for me  For the first couple weeks  Then I started seeing  Kind of the real kind of  Status quo tweets  Going out about work stuff  I was like no no no  I gotta take this over  And get a little bit more  Aggressive on that thing  You run your own  That's good  More and more celebrities  Are not running their own Twitter  But it's so obvious  Also who doesn't  When you see the one  Come see me at this thing  There's no humor  There's no response  I try to really respond  Back to the people  That follow me  And have a pretty good time  With it  That's how I started  Going back and forth 
[02:59:30]  With your girlfriend  I put a tweet out  About bacon  And she said something  About taking a bath  And I was like  I don't know  I'm kind of into this  I don't think my wife  Will appreciate it  But like  Who doesn't want to  Take a bath in bacon  By the way  You do understand  Her tweeting you  Was the equivalent  Of Linda Blair  And the exorcist  When it said  Help me  I missed the signal  But it was getting  The hell out of it  Pull the ripcord  Pull  And Dreddy  You haven't said much  You're talking politics 
[03:00:00]  That's not my thing  I'm listening  I'm learning a lot  I like the idea  I was going through  Some scenarios in my head  Of you maybe driving  Getting pulled over  The cops saying  Hey Mario Andretti  And you're going  No Michael  Michael  That happening  What's the fastest  You've been going  That you got pulled over for  Oh  Not too bad  Oh no  Around 90 or so  Oh that's nothing  I got a great story  About that  But I don't even know  If the statute of limitations  I got almost pulled over 
[03:00:30]  At 135 and a 25  But I managed to get  Around the next corner  And pull into a road  That I thought was like  Maybe I'll lose in the back roads  Because it's like  The guy's doing a K-turn  A little carried away  And I managed to pull  Into a guy's garage  Because it was just a cul-de-sac  It wasn't actually a road  I'm like oh crap  Now I ran  And now I'm  Pulled into a garage  Closed the garage door  The guy walks out  I was like what the hell  Are you doing in my home  I'm like is this like 125 oak  He's like not even close  I was like oh I got the wrong one  I got back in  I heard the sirens go the other way  No  I wasn't going to get stopped  For that one  That would have been bad  Six times the speed limit is rough 
[03:01:00]  They take you in  On that one  That was a younger  And dumber time in my life  Did you have a party in years?  Yeah I did  You did?  Yeah that's why  I don't really drink anymore  Because I'm not good at moderation  When did you stop?  About eight years ago  Oh okay  Yeah so  Now I just build buildings  That's a nice thing  To fall back on  No but you get a new addiction  Yeah hotel  For me it went from  I did drink and drugs  And stopped  And then for me  I went into porn  You went into creating  Buildings  Building America  I became a psycho 
[03:01:30]  About something  Something a little different  But it's amazing  How to  Porn is a big industry too  It sure is  But I don't contribute  On any real  You know what I mean  It's just humiliating  You contribute  What can be  Sopped up with a Kleenex  Yeah  And he's building  Jim socks  You know whatever  It's very valuable  To the sock producers  Of this country  I don't use socks anymore  But I did all through high school  What do you mean socks?  That's what I would clean up with  Not toilet paper  Oh shit  All right  Well I just wanted to ruin  The entire discussion  Yeah exactly  Well you got to use socks  Because it's like recycling 
[03:02:00]  I mean you know  Tissue is just a waste of paper  It's trees  You miss your partying years?  Listen I'm not going to lie to you  I enjoyed it  Because you're still young  I clearly enjoyed it  But you know  There's a time and a place  For everything  I've been pretty lucky  With kind of  Say the other hand  That I've been dealt  And I don't want to  Totally blow it  So you know  If you can't do something  In moderation  I think you got to  Just recognize that  And so you know  I don't know  I definitely miss it  Because I enjoyed it a lot  What finally told you  That it was too much?  You know after  A particularly aggressive weekend  With friends  I could tell the story  But it would take about an hour 
[03:02:30]  We don't have time  I love that aggressive  It was just a total mess  I literally woke up one day  I was like  Just felt guilty  And I was like  You know you're an idiot  Like so you know  I got lucky through school  You know I was pretty good  At academics  And these kind of things  I could get through it  You know no problem  And still have a good time  So I had a good balance there  But I think  You know I'm the first graduate  Of the Wharton School of Finance  To move to Aspen  To be a bartender  For a year and a half  So you know  I had some normal  I had some normal  Or not normal times  In my life I guess too  So yeah  The moderation thing  Doesn't work for me  So I just got to pick a path 
[03:03:00]  Did you have any trouble  Living in the shadow  Of your father  Especially going into  The same business?  Well it was a little weird  You know I think  I was always the one  In the background  You know you're always  Compared to him  And things like that  But you know  To me it was normal  And you know  I'm very proud  Of the whole thing  The way it worked out  You know  To be able to  Carry on the legacy  And now have my son  Doing it  But there's times  Where you know  You're definitely  Overshoured  I think that people  Expect a lot more 
[03:03:30]  Out of you  I'm sure he could  Say the same thing  Because you know  Just for the name  Just because of the name  And you know  Your father is an icon  And all that  So you know  There's definitely  Certain pressures on you  You ever push yourself  Harder than you think  You should have  Because of the name  I've always pushed  Myself hard  And I think you know  I found after I retired  Like what really drove me  And it was more  Not failing  Than the actual win  You know  Because I think that  Just because I grew up  Son of  So I just didn't want  To let anybody down  I didn't want to  You know  And so that's what 
[03:04:00]  Really drove me  And I drove myself  Really hard  And probably doing it  Though I didn't have  As much fun as  Say Donald  You know  He did the right thing  Had some fun  I went right into it  And I was a boring guy  All I did was race  It's all I  That was 100%  Of my thought  So it was  Yeah that sucks  I get to sit at a desk  And look at a computer  All day  Yeah  Race car driving  That's boring as hell  I hate you Michael  I hate you  It sounds exciting  But it's  You know  Basically you had a racetrack 
[03:04:30]  And you're at a hotel  And that's it  You know  So  How's your son do  Because we don't know  The race game that  He's doing well  He's doing real well  Yeah  Yep  I think he's going to have  A real strong year this year  So I'm pretty excited  Cool man  Yeah  That's great man  Well good luck with the show  Thank you very much guys  Hopefully we'll see you  Before it airs  Let me know  You're going to get a hold of me  Please  Yeah  Fly fishing in May  Right Bobby  Yeah we're in  Fly fishing  Yes at our new place  Yeah  Our new place  Yeah  I'm going to go up to my cabin
