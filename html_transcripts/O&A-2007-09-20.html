<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a self-deprecating introduction acknowledging their reputation as shock jocks.  They briefly discussed a listener email about a broken refrigerator before transitioning to a conversation about fleeting internet fame. This led into "Perv News Thursday," focusing on a graphic description and speculation about a noseless man involved in a kidnapping.  This was followed by "Fun Fact Thursday," with listener-submitted facts, many of which the hosts dismissed. A substantial portion of the show then focused on leaked photos of Oscar De La Hoya in what was described as provocative female attire, accompanied by homophobic slurs and vulgar language.  A listener call detailing the high number of autoerotic asphyxiation deaths among young men, with graphic details, followed.  The segment concluded with the repeated playing of a children's game jingle, "Mr. Bucket," which the hosts found hilariously suggestive due to its lyrics and visuals, prompting extended commentary and jokes. Several listener calls, including a "F.U. Line" segment with angry and offensive messages, and a discussion about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's planned Ground Zero visit, concluded this section.

The next part covered the hosts' anger at "Axis of Evil" leaders visiting NYC for the UN General Assembly, proposing the UN's relocation to a more dangerous location.  They then discussed a Daily News headline about Vince McMahon's message to the Iranian president, followed by a caller correcting their understanding of the difference between Iranians and Arabs.  This led to speculation about Osama bin Laden's changed appearance and a bizarre story about a man waking up during his own autopsy in Venezuela.  Listener calls covered a complaint about the "Mr. Bucket" song, a fun fact about April 15th coincidences, *CHiPs* (specifically Eric Estrada's disco performance), and a listener's cat, Jack Jack.  O.J. Simpson's release and Sherry Shepard's comments on *The View* about the earth's shape were also discussed.  Comedian Greg Giraldo was a guest, and a lengthy discussion ensued about one host's strained relationship with his mother, detailing a difficult dinner and subsequent estrangement.

Further discussions centered on difficult mother-son relationships, with anecdotes shared by the hosts and callers Jim and Mark. Mark's story involved his mother being shot and killed by her ex-boyfriend in front of him. Greg Giraldo performed stand-up, and the hosts discussed his appearance at the Flavor Flav roast. Seth MacFarlane called in to promote *Family Guy*, discussing syndication, the FCC, and an upcoming *Star Wars* episode. A caller, Kim from Wisconsin (moving to Colorado), shared a bizarre anecdote about a meal, leading to further humorous discussion. The segment concluded with discussions about the "Miss Paltalk Contest," rumors about Opie and Anthony's potential replacement, Kid Chris, legal issues surrounding contest prizes, Greg Giraldo's legal experiences (including briefly representing Jeff Ross), and a discussion of convicted serial rapist Vince Champ.

Another segment heavily featured the leaked photos of Oscar De La Hoya, with sexually explicit commentary from the hosts and Greg Giraldo. This transitioned into further discussion of Vince Champ, with a call from his friend Ronnie B detailing Champ's shocking duality.  Jay Moore attempted to reconcile Opie and Ronnie.  Comedic impressions of white people's reactions to rape and Greg Giraldo's FoxSports.com webisode were also included. The segment concluded with discussion of intern Rene's homework assignment (a video of an overweight man singing "Baby Got Back" in Walmart), details of Rene's past relationship with intern Pat Duffy, and a graphic description of Pat's sexual activities with multiple women on a single night.

The final segment focused extensively and graphically on cunnilingus, with detailed discussions of techniques and personal experiences, using vulgar language and props. Pat Duffy's perceived ineptitude at cunnilingus was heavily discussed, along with anecdotes from his girlfriends. A caller shared a shocking story about a gynecologist performing a "shocker" during exams.  Other sexual topics, blowjobs, and callers’ sexual preferences and experiences were also discussed.  Greg Giraldo offered comedic interjections throughout. The show ended with a “line of the day” segment and a brief appearance by The Iron Sheik.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Shots, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.

That he's very, very depressed because his refrigerator door fell off. 
[00:01:00]  It made a break for Opie and Anthony.  Stupid Australians whose national hero got killed by a docile flying fish.  This is the worst, the worst show I've, this is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I like turtles.

It isn't even, uh, it used to be people that have, uh, uh, their 15 minutes of fame.  It's been reduced to 15 seconds to a couple newscasts.  You get like, you know, ah, you're on, uh, YouTube, you're on break, uh, you're on,  uh, that, that, what's that German sounding site that breaks all the news?

I really don't.  I, I got...  Damn!  You just been pwned!  I, I enjoy that one, but I, I don't think it's, uh... 
[00:04:00]  That one was making its way up the charts, but, uh, I think I got it.  Up the charts.  Because I'm obsessed that I want the best sound clip.  The clip.  So I got, I, I claimed, I claimed Owl Guy.  Yeah.  Behind your back, I ran and got...  I like turtles.  Yeah.  Because we only play that once or twice.  Yeah, that's, that's a good one.  And then I went with...  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  See, those...  You can't lose with retards. 
[00:04:30]  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses.  Dresses.  I like to wear nap polish.  I like to wear dresses.  And then, of course, uh, you're not gonna beat this anytime soon.  I am the werewolf.  No.  I like to make werewolf movies.  Movies.  Movies.  Movies.  Movies.  That, by the way, if anyone's keeping track, my favorite clip right now is, I like to make werewolf movies. 
[00:05:00]  I prefer William.  Yeah?  Which one?  The fingernail polish?  I like to wear dresses.  But he sexies it up a little when he pops.  It's the way he says movies that gets me.  Every time, right?  I like to make werewolf movies.  Movies.  Movies.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  Polish.  You can see him sexying it up a little.  Yeah, yeah.  He's really working.  He's a little tart. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  A re-tart.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  I like to wear dresses.  I like to wear dresses.  I like to wear dresses.  I like to wear dresses.  Well, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Indeed.  What do we got for today?  Well, we got Fun Fact Thursday.  I love Fun Fact Thursday.  Anytime I could educate the people or be educated.  Well, how about this one?  It's a good day.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Fun Fact Thursday.  In 1934, American commentator Walter Winchell first coined the term disc jockey. 
[00:06:00]  Walter Winchell, huh?  Yes.  So there's your first Fun Fact of the day.  Fun Fact.  It's relevant to radio.  Perv News Thursday.  We got a great story today about a noseless man accused in kidnapping of a woman.  All right.  You want to get it out of the way?  Give the people something good early in the morning?  Could be an advantage to them. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, exactly.  She's a...  Or earless.  Earless would be great, too, if you were the woman.  Earless.  Well, look at the guy.  Look at this guy.  Look at the picture of the guy.  Oh!  Wow!  Put that picture on him.  What?  Dude, what happened?  He's got one hole in the middle of his face.  Yeah, and they kind of, like...  They have some kind of, like, tube apparatus so he can breathe through it.  Get out of here.  There's a tube in there?  Yeah, there's no nose there.  And what's with his mouth?  And the mouth, I don't know. 
[00:07:00]  He's looking like he's doing Bill Murray in Caddyshack.  I lost my nose.  What is that?  What a wreck.  You're going to kidnap a woman.  Kidnap a woman.  I lost my nose.  Yeah, what's up with the mouth?  You know, Danny?  Is he burning you?  No, unfortunately, the story doesn't get into how he lost the nose.  All right.  It was a gopher accident.  They make him sound like a Dick Tracy character by referring to him as no nose and then his  last name.  No nose.  It was a sand wedge. 
[00:07:30]  At Augusta.  At Augusta.  Looks like he has a T.  My nose is a hole.  My nose is a hole.  Looks like there's a T in the middle of his face.  A T?  That's pushed all the way in.  Right?  You can put a golf ball on there.  His lips are messed up, too.  He was a burn victim of some sort.  Something happened.  Did his nose get burned off?  I don't know.  Singe his little nose.  But, well, it's Perv News Thursday.  Why don't we do this really fast?  Yeah.  We'll put the picture on Pal Talk for all the folks there, E-Rock, and then somehow we've 
[00:08:00]  got to get this picture up on our website that no one knows about because we're not  allowed to promote.  I know what happened to him, actually.  Huh?  Oh.  He won the Move Hot Embers with Your Nose competition.  At least he won.  His whole face is just devoid of almost anything.  It's like a giant burn area.  Yeah.  A little hole for the mouth and no nose.  And he still, even though he has no nose, you still look at that awful hair of his sporting  the skullet.  The skullet.  Where it's the mullet with the bald head. 
[00:08:30]  All right.  The skullet.  Here's your Perv News for Perv News Thursday.  It's a story stranger than fiction.  They duct-taped me here in the house, my ankles, my wrists.  48-year-old Jeanette Reland says three weeks ago, her live-in boyfriend and two friends  duct-taped her from head to toe, shoved her inside this car, and drove her from Lake Elsinore  to Rosarito Beach, Mexico.  I don't know where that is.  What did you think?  I was going to die.  Reland says she was able to get back across the border with no money and no passport, 
[00:09:00]  and when she got home, she reported the crime to authorities.  Her boyfriend, Donald Turk, and his two friends, Robert Wayne No-Nose Gardner and Robert Paul  McCabe were all arrested.  Reland says No-Nose and McCabe made sure she didn't get away.  They were talking about it on the way down.  What they should do to me.  The guy has a real name, and they call him No-Nose.  No-Nose.  They used his real name with the No-Nose in between, like a mobster, and then they just  went to No-Nose because it's much more funny. 
[00:09:30]  How funny would it be if his last name was No-Nose?  No-Nose.  So, boyfriend kidnaps girl.  No-N-N-N-N-Nose.  With No-Nose accomplice.  No-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-Nose.  That's what his nightmares are.  He wakes up just thinking he's in a room of Kleenex.  There's nothing he can do about the useless.  He just has to curl one up and shove it in and pull it out.  That's blowing his nose.  Here's another fun fact coming in.  Is this true?  I want our research department to look this one up. 
[00:10:00]  In 1976, Van Halen is discovered by Gene Simmons.  Did we know this?  I think so, yeah.  At the Starwood in Los Angeles, they record a demo at Village Records Studios in L.A.,  and then two guitar soloists are later recorded at Electric Ladyland Studios in New York.  Gene Simmons discovered Van Halen?  I had no idea about that, really.  Steve, you know that one, huh?  Yeah.  Does he get money from him?  No, he doesn't.  He discovered and wanted to be called Daddy Longlegs was the first name he came up with for them.  Really?  Yeah.  What a tool. 
[00:10:30]  That's pretty cool, though.  I didn't know that.  All right, back to no-nos.  Yeah.  Strangely, the Lake Elsinore home Turk and Relan share is where we found them both Tuesday night.  They're going to prison.  You see my breezes everywhere?  See my, look, they're everywhere.  Both were half-dressed and both smelled of alcohol.  They just walked up to the house and they answered the door?  Well, this is after she got back home. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  And who was she naked with?  Her boyfriend that kidnapped her?  Yeah, that kidnapped her.  So he's going to jail even though she's still living with him.  And when the news crew came over, they were both half-naked.  They were a little drunk.  And drunk.  According to that news report.  Where was no-nos during all this?  I don't know.  That no-nos wasn't over.  Was he with prune face?  Yeah, and flat top.  Flat top.  He was picking up Mr. Potato Head.  Calling all cars.  Be on the lookout for no-nos.  Yeah, we need some Dick Tracy type of music. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Both were half-dressed and both smelled of alcohol.  You told the police that he kidnapped you.  Yeah, he duct taped me.  Yeah, you're back at the house.  Yeah, because I've got to get my stuff out of here.  Everything, I've got to have everything, all my stuff to hear.  Did you kidnap her?  Say yes.  You ever have a domestic dispute?  There's nothing serious about it.  So you were kidding around?  We're kidding around.  We're having adult fun.  We're having adult fun. 
[00:12:00]  I didn't know Danny was making a comment.  We're just having adult fun.  She's just insulted that he brought no-nos along.  No-nos.  How dare you insult me with no-nos?  She probably was hoping for a threesome.  The only guy this guy can come up with is no-nos.  He's good for one thing.  The threesome.  If no-nos doesn't get in the way, you can get right down there.  Yeah.  Here's the good news for her. 
[00:12:30]  She doesn't have to shower.  No-nos, of course.  Put a crazy straw in there.  Drink something.  Investigators say when a neighbor asked Turk about his girlfriend, he said he got rid of  her in Mexico and she wouldn't be coming back.  Turk, no-nose Gardner, and McCabe are all facing kidnapping charges tonight.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  That's fantastic.  No-nos.  There's your perv news.  There's a little perv news.  Yeah.  We'll have some more later on, but no-nos is a classic. 
[00:13:00]  Here, put the picture up on PalTalk there, E-Rock, or somebody, Danny.  Yeah.  Instead of your usual, E-Rock, your naked Harry Potter pictures.  Yeah.  We'll put no-nos up there for all the PalTalkers.  Let's say hi to Mike in Pittsburgh.  We don't talk to Pittsburgh much these days.  I don't know why.  What's up, Mike?  Good morning, guys.  How are you?  How are you, Mike?  Pretty good.  Can't complain.  People are just looking at no-nos on PalTalk and just spelling out.  Ah!  Oh, dear God in heaven. 
[00:13:30]  Ew.  Ew.  Yeah.  Someone just laughing.  Ha-ha.  Kick it down.  What a creep.  That is really good.  Yeah.  No-nos.  No-nos is a hit today already.  What do you got, Mike?  Well, I got a fun fact for you that falls under Perv News Thursday.  Okay.  I'm a firefighter down here in Pittsburgh.  We run first responder calls as part of the job.  And every year, 400 young men between 18 and 32 unfortunately die of auto-erotic association. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  60% of them, their mother or father walk in on them and have to dress them up for the  paramedics to get there.  So it looks like a suicide.  So how do they find out it's auto-erotic asphyxiation?  The hand is frozen in that position?  And some rigor sets in and...  They all kill themselves with a soda in their hand or some sort of beverage.  That's where you get completely naked and then, yeah, hang yourself while you're taking 
[00:14:30]  care of yourself and hopefully you'll let yourself loose before you die.  So you're saying most of the suicides are actually that?  Yes.  There's a way of determining it because, unfortunately, when you die that way, you're going out with  a rod.  Wow.  Hmm.  Yeah?  And it takes 400 of our youths a year.  Why are you breathing heavy?  Yeah, what are you...  Is this story making you hot? 
[00:15:00]  No, no.  I got a cold.  Are we talking to no-nos?  Yeah.  I think no-nos is doing me in.  I might have to take care of myself here.  All right.  There you might.  Let's go to Joanne in Arizona.  Joanne, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I have a fun pack.  All right.  Let's hear it, Joanne.  There are more national parks in Arizona than any other state. 
[00:15:30]  Nothing fun about that.  That's not fun.  That's just a fact.  That's just a fact.  Right.  That's not even a fun fact.  There's if you love parks and all you want to talk about is parks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a difference between a fact and a fun fact.  A fun fact makes you go, oh, wow, that's kind of cool.  Yeah, that's not bad.  That's interesting.  Oh, I never knew that.  That's fun.  No one is saying that after your fact there, Joanne.  I have another fun fact that's even better. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  Did you know that you cannot fold a piece of paper more than that?  Oh, this one.  More than how many times?  Eight.  Eight.  I can.  Yeah, I've done it many times.  I think they disproved that with a giant sheet of paper.  Yeah.  Not in half.  Yes.  Fun fact Thursday sucks. 
[00:16:30]  It doesn't suck.  We just got to screen these callers better.  Travis, screen the callers.  We don't like doing that, but we're going to screen today because we need real fun facts.  Not in half.  All right, let's try Dennis in Boston.  No nose has a gaping face.  Yeah.  He's gaping.  Let's say hi to Dennis.  What's up?  Hey, fellas.  Goal, Pat.  Goal.  What?  I got a fun fact.  Okay. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  All right.  On average, more than 10 people are killed by vending machines each year.  Oh, we've done that one already.  We did that when we were doing our shark report.  Right.  More people are killed by vending machines each year than sharks.  Here's a fun fact coming in from the Instant V-back.  Joanne sucks.  Ah.  Mm-hmm.  Another fun fact coming in from J.D. Collins in Maine.  I have a fun fact.  Joanne is a bag of suck.  All right. 
[00:17:30]  We're just getting started here, of course.  Special Endeavor.  Now, that was a fun fact.  Yeah.  We learned a lot.  We found out that the Special Endeavor was built from parts that were left over from Special Challenger.  Challenger.  Special Discovery.  Special Endeavor.  See, that's why we do Fun Fact Thursday.  We would have never got the famous clip, Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Special Endeavor.  If it wasn't for Fun Fact Thursday.  I like turtles.  I do, too.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish. 
[00:18:00]  How ironic that William apparently likes what Oscar De La Hoya likes.  Did anybody read the article?  What?  Oh, Oscar's a naughty boy.  Weren't you hinting about that?  I would never hint about that.  Somebody at some point, yeah, someone on this show is hinting but didn't say the name.  Wait, that's him?  That's where?  No, that's got to be a joke.  I'm on, where am I at there?  E-Rock, help us out.  One of those.  We'll have it up on our site in a minute.  What is it, though?  What would Tyler Durden do? 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, but that looks like he's posing as a goof, like he's going out like that for Halloween or something.  Wait, dude, wait a minute.  What is that?  That's a picture of Oscar De La Hoya, and why don't you explain this, Jim?  He's got the high heels on.  Yeah, he's wearing, in one picture, he's bent over, kind of holding the wall, wearing almost  like a fishnet outfit from head to toe with a pair of panties and black shoes, and in  the other one...  Wait, and he's got a wig on, too.  Let's not forget the wig.  I kind of forgot that.  He has actually a long, like a brown wig, a little pair of shoulder length, and in 
[00:19:00]  the other picture, he's standing against the wall holding a red beverage in the same  smart outfit.  Oscar, Oscar, Oscar.  He's wearing a sassy little...  Sassy little hat.  He's wearing like a little fedora, and there's an article here in apparently some scores dancer.  Why you'd let her take pictures, I don't know, has pictures of him dressed like this.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, but it looks like he's posing, so...  Yeah, but it's not a goof, though.  That bent over one doesn't look good. 
[00:19:30]  Well...  Doesn't look good for him.  From the website that will link to our website, feel free to ask me, the website, why boxing  superstar and first husband of Joanna Moeckler, yes, Oscar De La Hoya, is dressed like some  tarted-up hussy.  But keep in mind, I have absolutely no idea what the answer might be.  He looks drunk, so he'll probably claim that he was just screwing around for the camera,  but it's hard not to notice how nicely everything fits, like he's done this a few times.  He bought that S. He tried it on and then bought it. 
[00:20:00]  If he ever fights again, he should wear that.  The other guy won't know is he's being attacked or seduced.  He'll fall down laughing.  Well, uh...  And what is the paper saying today?  The New York Post or the Daily News?  No, Daily News.  Daily News?  A stripper said that he would regularly invite her and others to parties to enjoy, he'd like  fly them first class, and there was men and women there.  And he liked to, he wore a size nine lady shoe, and he would pretend, he liked wearing like 
[00:20:30]  thigh highs and, uh, and like gloves, like ladies' gloves, and pretend, is that him again?  Yeah.  Why are you zipping through the, fast, quickly through the hot ones, stupid?  Trying to do something.  Okay.  So, and he would like pretend that he was on a motorcycle, and the girl was the guy,  and he would like hold on to her waist and scream, faster, faster, like he wanted to  be driven on the motorcycle.  That's cute.  Oh, wow.  What is going on there?  And now...  There's a lot of people listening, uh, right now that have dressed like a woman for like 
[00:21:00]  a Halloween party or something.  That's a little much.  This is, this is way past that.  I mean, way past that.  And, and he's, his, uh, rep is saying that, uh, they're obviously photoshopped, uh, his  head's too small, and it doesn't even look like his body.  Um, what?  Hold on.  His head is not too small, and yes, it does look like his body.  Yeah, it certainly looks like his body, man.  I mean, the rep's doing her job.  And, uh, he just looks completely hammered.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Look at that.  That's something too.  You could, uh, you could get this, uh, plausible deniability these days because people could  just say, ah, it's photoshopped.  They've gotten really good at doing that.  Right.  But no, that's him.  That looks like it's him.  Yeah, it certainly does.  What's the website for the people that can't wait for us to link it there, E-Rock?  Um, this, this one has more photos.  It's drunkenstepfather.com.  Yeah, I like drunkenstepfather.com.  I'm going to call my, uh, my ex from, uh, maybe she may have some answers.  Okay.  She may know something. 
[00:22:00]  Ah, there's been, there's been rumors and, there's been rumors, uh, suggested over the  years.  Ah.  Someone in here is just nodding.  Well, you might have an expert.  Not only nodding, but a look while he nods that's just like, oh, this isn't even a question.  It's not even close to being fake.  Hey, I don't even know what this is.  I can just say that there's certain things that we were talking about this morning that  I mentioned six years ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  2000.  Now they got them without the wig on with the, the fishnet, uh, outfit from head to toe 
[00:22:30]  with tiny little panties on, high heels and boxing gloves.  Boxing gloves.  That would really suck if someone dressed like that beat the crap out of you.  Would.  He would.  Well, hold on.  My name is William and I like to wear dresses.  Yeah.  Dresses.  My name is William and I like fingernail polish.  Wow.  A hell of a start for, for the show today, huh?  Poor Oscar.  Yeah.  He just wants to be, he just wants to be pretty.  Wants to be pretty. 
[00:23:00]  Wants to feel girly.  So, eh.  Why is she releasing these pictures if, uh.  I do not know.  And why would he pose for these pictures knowing some, someday they could get out there?  My only thought is that he's not as computer savvy as he thought and thought that he was  going to get them on his computer and she kept the copy.  I mean, I can't imagine why, as an alpha male like he is.  Yeah.  You would pose for that.  And gay.  And gay.  I mean, uh, yeah, I'll, I'll talk to, I'll, I'll talk to my friend, maybe she knows 
[00:23:30]  something.  I feel charming, so charming.  He, he certainly, he's charming.  That is stuff that he didn't just yank out, apparently, it fits well.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's not hanging on him like a costume.  Isn't it amazing, though, at one point in history, like, the ex-champ dressed like this,  you would freak out.  In this day and age, you're like, yeah, I do think that's him.  Ah, whatever.  Ah, whatever.  No one cares.  Who cares?  People care.  They're going to check out these pictures.  Very, very interesting.  So, it's, uh, drunkenstepfather.com, right? 
[00:24:00]  We got to take our first break.  Phone number, 877-212-O-A.  Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  Fun fact Thursday.  Our pal Chris Cox from L.A., he writes, uh, fun Opie fact.  Oh.  Eugene Lindsey Opie is the author of Diseases of the Pancreas.  See?  Now, that's a fun fact.  That's fun. 
[00:24:30]  It involves your name.  Much better than Parks in Arizona.  What a coincidence.  You're fiancé.  By the way, uh, just before the, just before we came back from break, I should say, you're  talking about your stupid Yankees.  F the Yankees.  I was just saying, they, uh, this time of year.  Go Sox, go!  Yeah, go, all right.  Go to second place pretty soon.  Go Sox, go!  It's just interesting.  This time of year, the Yankees can know how to, know how to pull it together, and the 
[00:25:00]  Sox kind of fall apart.  They've been dropping games.  The Yankees have been winning, and now they're a game and a half back.  I remember when they were 14 and a half, 15, what was it, 15 games back?  Yeah.  Yikes.  My, uh, my team, you know, trying to hold off the Phillies, so.  Ah, the Mets.  Mets trying to hold off the Phillies.  They got lucky last night, too, though.  Because they won, and then, uh, who lost?  The Phillies, did they play last night?  I don't know.  It's too early.  Yeah.  Oh, wait, we're supposed to know that stuff. 
[00:25:30]  I don't keep tabs on that side.  Some of them will tell us.  But I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm helping the Mets, you know.  It's getting close here.  My team.  Mets are a cute team.  They're a nice, uh, team for the girlfriends.  Shut up.  They are.  You're a Yankees fan.  You usually have a girlfriend that's a Mets fan, and you get into, like, oh, you.  I'm turning up the music.  I guess it's the other way around.  I'm turning up the music.  In your apartment.  What?  What?  I don't see many pink Mets caps. 
[00:26:00]  I see plenty of them.  I see plenty of pink Yankee caps.  Are you kidding?  And, and Boston, shut up.  You guys are the kings of the pink baseball cap.  If you go to Gay Stadium.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Gay Stadium.  Get it?  Gay instead of say.  Shut up.  You'll see plenty of girls there with, uh, you know, the pink hats and pink shirts.  I believe the Red Sox invented the, the pink hat. 
[00:26:30]  Did they?  And then the rest of the teams kind of, like, adopted that look.  Yeah.  Phillies lost yesterday.  The pink sock.  Phillies lost.  Yes, they lost in 10.  I'm pushing for the Sox, and I'm pushing for the Mets, because I want that rematch.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I was hoping it was going to happen last year, because, you know, 20 years later, but.  Yeah, yeah.  But I'll take it this year.  Mets two and a half ahead of the Phillies.  Yes.  Thank you.  Mets won eight four over Washington.  Yeah, they, every once in a while, the Mets play, like, a triple-A team. 
[00:27:00]  They let the triple-A team, uh, play a few games.  Yeah.  This is a test of the emergency alert system.  This is only a test.  This concludes this test of the emergency alert system. 
[00:27:30]  If this had been an actual emergency, the tones you just heard would have been followed  by additional information or instruction.  We now return to your XM programming, already in progress.  Rated for no sack.  In very girly, uh, girly attire.  There is a, uh, a problem I'm seeing with this.  He doesn't seem to have, uh, certain goods that would, uh, just have to be kind of falling 
[00:28:00]  out at this point if you're wearing, uh, female, certain female undergarments.  All right, let me explain something, something to you, Anthony.  All righty.  First of all, if you look really closely to the shot E-Roc's got up on the screen, you  see something that's kind of, kind of peeking out there.  Let me, let me, uh.  Something's peeking out there.  Make the window bigger.  What, oh, you think in the upper, upper part of the left, uh, quadrant? 
[00:28:30]  Well, the, the right leg.  Yeah.  In the picture, yes.  Oh.  I don't know what that is.  Yeah, I know.  I'm really disgusted by this.  I know what that is.  Look at that.  Oh, God.  What is.  That's a bat wing.  E-Roc blew this up to actual size.  That's a bat wing.  Oh, okay.  And that, and you wonder where his, uh, you know what is.  Well, he's wearing two panties, it looks like.  Yeah, yeah.  He's kind of a, uh, like a light pink number under a black.  Looks like he has an ear on his thigh. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  And that's like a bat wing sticking out.  And he's trying to do a sexy pose with one leg up on the bathtub.  And what, what is, what is this guy into?  Wow.  I don't know what this is all about.  It's drunkenstepfather.com if you want to see the pictures for yourself.  They have the best pictures so far.  And it's a big story in our paper today.  They're trying to figure out why he's dressed like this.  And how do the pictures get out?  But it's a, it's a fish.  Yeah.  It's a, uh, a, a, a, a fishnet, I guess. 
[00:29:30]  Head to toe outfit.  Yeah.  And he's wearing panties, uh, over him, I guess.  How do you let a stripper from scores keep pictures like that?  I just don't.  Uh, they're, uh, they're trustworthy, I would think.  It had to do with his camera and she had to swipe him.  Yeah.  Well, we're getting info on this.  Joe in Florida.  Joe.  How you guys doing?  Hey.  Uh, we, uh, I was watching The Contender last week.  And, uh, Oscar De La Hoya came in and said, uh, he's got an upcoming fight. 
[00:30:00]  His, uh, boys from Golden Boy, they're going to have an upcoming fight with a couple of Sugar Ray  Leonard's boys who hosts The Contender.  And, uh, whoever loses that fight, they made a bet.  They're going to have to dress and drag and be the ring girl.  So, they're in a round.  So, this might have something to do with that.  No, that's probably what inspired that.  Yeah, I don't care.  This way, if he wins, he wins.  And if he loses, at least he can feel, you know, hot and march around.  You know, it may inspire it.  And you might have to, like, go, all right, this is what I'll look like doing it. 
[00:30:30]  But he's way too into it.  And I have to say, I mean, he really didn't look that bothered when Sugar Ray Leonard put  that bet out there.  Right, right.  Also, I'm going to boot camp next Monday.  I'm going to miss you guys.  Aw, man, good luck to you, bro.  Boot camp?  What are you going for?  College money?  No, I'm stupid.  You're just going to kick some ass?  Yes, sir.  I want to kill somebody.  Right.  Do you really want to kill someone?  Well, you know, my dad was Navy for 20 years, and I'm looking to go kick some ass.  What are you going into? 
[00:31:00]  Uh, the Marine Corps.  The Corps.  The Corps.  Hoorah.  Yes, sir.  All right, Joe, good luck to you.  Yeah, stay safe, all right?  Huge fan, I love you guys, all right?  All right, man, we'll see you when you get back, Joe.  Don't go getting blowed up or nothing.  All right, let's go to Lindsay in Boston.  Lindsay.  I've got a fun fact.  First of all, do you own a pink Red Sox hat?  Yellow.  Wow.  Was that a tough question?  Is she looking?  Lindsay. 
[00:31:30]  Lindsay.  She's got a fun fact.  Lindsay.  Hang up.  She's gone.  I think she ran to it.  No, she's still on the line.  I think she ran to her closet to check.  Throw her on hold.  Her fun fact is the term homosexuality was coined in 1892.  Really?  That's what she's saying today.  What did they call him before that?  That's a good question for today.  That would be a fun fact.  All right, I'm sorry to do this.  You picked the wrong day to listen to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:32:00]  Why?  Every once in a while, we like to find a little something, a little nugget, and we like to  get it stuck in your head.  This is an actual commercial.  From what year, by the way?  It's for a game.  Oh, from the 90s?  That's it?  90s?  Yeah, this was a game.  No way.  It has to be the early 90s.  I remember this.  You remember this?  Oh, hell yeah.  I don't remember this one.  I remember this song.  I used to laugh my ass off. 
[00:32:30]  But I remember the apartment I was in when I was watching it, and that was kind of the  80s.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like 80s.  All right, maybe late 80s, mid-80s, something like that?  The wise Wikipedia is saying, release 1992.  1992, okay.  Well, we're going to get this stuck in your head today.  Wikipedia is stupid.  And by the way, audience participation, make up your own jokes after you hear this.  Yeah, it's just a fun commercial.  For a game.  You'll remember it. 
[00:33:00]  For a kid.  Believe me, you'll remember it.  It's very nostalgic, and it's fun to listen to.  And I don't know why it was not this funny when it was on the television.  Yeah.  Because now it's just really funny.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Push your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth and we'll pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls in, and Mr. Bucket wins.  But look how.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth. 
[00:33:30]  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls what I'm about.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Mr. Bucket.  From Milton Bradley.  That's the fun.  I like turtles.  Yeah, I know.  You like turtles.  Mr. Bucket's a good egg.  Man, what is that all about?  It just doesn't look like a particularly fun game.  No.  Like, you drop a ball in Mr. Bucket's head, and his mouth is a big circle, and the ball just  falls out.  It pops out.  It's a game for three-year-olds.  Have you ever hung around a three-year-old? 
[00:34:00]  Yes.  If you can give them a piece of paper, they'll be amazed for hours.  You know what I think the object was?  What?  You get different colored balls.  You got to put them in Mr. Bucket's mouth.  No, no.  You put them in his head.  In his head.  In his mouth.  And then they pop out his mouth, and then you got to run back and put it back in his  head.  Because if all your balls pop out, then you'll lose.  And to make it a little challenging for the kids, they have a little shovel.  They can do it with a shovel.  But see, they don't explain it like that.  No.  Because then the song wouldn't be as fun.  It's just fun saying, I'm Mr. Bucket. 
[00:34:30]  The balls pop out of my mouth.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Push your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth, I will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I like it.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls into Mr. Bucket wins.  But look how.  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm always what I'm about.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  We're all going to run.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Everyone wins. 
[00:35:00]  From milk and Bradley.  That's the fun.  Not everyone wins.  Someone is suggesting that Oscar De La Hoya lost every time.  When he was playing Mr. Bucket.  Mr. Bucket.  The thing with Mr. Bucket is the ball apparently shoots out of the mouth too.  It's not just falling out.  There's something inside of Mr. Bucket that probably propels it out.  Yes.  Propels the balls out of his mouth.  And then you got to like pick him up and put him back in his head because the first  one to get all their balls in his head without him popping out of his mouth wins.  Because then all of a sudden you like got one ball left and you're like oh oh oh. 
[00:35:30]  You put it in his head and bam the other ball shoots out of his mouth and now you got to  run and chase that one and you were almost a winner.  And the frustrating thing is the ball cannot go in the mouth because of the way the thing  is set up.  No you got to put it on the top of his head.  What about Mr.  What's that first line in that song?  It annoys me.  Mr. Bucket.  It's like he's confirming he's Mr. Bucket.  Like people are like are you Mr. Bucket?  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Can you hear the first line of that song?  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  Oh wow.  That's right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Awful me.  Very good. 
[00:36:00]  The girl at the start of the commercial sounds like she's saying let's just put it this  way.  Instead of saying Bucket she's saying something else.  Might be a little dirtier.  All right.  Let's hear.  She's saying something fun.  Mr. Bucket.  That's good.  Well little.  It's a stretch.  Maybe she's blowing off the idea of the game.  Yeah.  Being dismissive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  I hear it now.  Now they're going to play this five times a second.  Listen.  Everyone's going to hear it. 
[00:36:30]  Listen closely.  Mr. Bucket.  That's good.  You know how kids are.  They can't pronounce stuff properly.  He's like that's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  And she's looking at him like so who mentioned you?  I didn't say that.  Mr. Bucket.  That's right.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  What?  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Ponch your balls in my top.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Out of my mouth I will pop.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  The game's Mr. Bucket.  The first to get their balls into Mr. Bucket wins.  But look out. 
[00:37:00]  Because the balls will pop out of his mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  The balls will pop out of my mouth.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Our balls what I'm about.  I'm Mr. Bucket.  Wee.  Wee.  Wee.  It's not a we, it's not a ride  There's nothing we about it  Mr. Bucket is a yellow hunk of garbage  It's funny, in the commercial  The kids are just, the angle is a floor angle  You're on the floor  Yeah, with Mr. Bucket  So Mr. Bucket just looks like an entity  Get out of the way, Mr. Bucket's coming  Spitting balls, causing a ruckus  And it's just the kids are running around 
[00:37:30]  Mr. Bucket is not fun  Wow, late breaking news  Oscar De La Hoya  Just changed his name to Mr. Bucket  I like turtles  Yeah, we know you like turtles, stop already  Oh, the kids are screaming  Playing Mr. Bucket with shovels  Whee! Whee! Yeah, Mr. Bucket  Who else whee?  Both of them out of my mouth, whee  Mr. Bucket  That's right, I'm Mr. Bucket  I'm Mr. Bucket, kosher balls in my top  I'm Mr. Bucket, out of my mouth 
[00:38:00]  I'm Mr. Bucket  We're all the new ones, I'm Mr. Bucket  Bucket's on  I like the fact that it just continually sounds like  Heather Mills' leg coming off  I'm Mr. Bucket  He wants to play too  A lot of people, let's just put it this way  Are wondering about the black balls  In the game  Let's just put it that way  Steve from Bayshore seems to be  Suggesting a game for E-Rock 
[00:38:30]  A mayo bucket  Put your food in my top  Into his mouth it will pop  But it never comes out  Yeah, that's the problem with that game  Kids are just waiting around for the food to pop out  And it never does  It never does  We threw donuts in his head  None of them came out, mother  This will get stuck in everyone's head  I'm Mr. Bucket  Out of my mouth it will pop  I'm Mr. Bucket  We're all gonna run 
[00:39:00]  I'm Mr. Bucket  The game's Mr. Bucket  The first to get their balls in  And Mr. Bucket wins  But look out  Cause the balls will pop out of his mouth  I'm Mr. Bucket  The balls will pop out of my mouth  I'm Mr. Bucket  Our ball is what I'm about  I'm Mr. Bucket  We're all gonna run  I'm Mr. Bucket  I'm Mr. Bucket  Another feature  Another feature I just noticed that I forgot about  Is Mr. Bucket has two arms  Yeah  And they move over his head  As like a ball blocker  For the top of his head 
[00:39:30]  So it makes it harder to get your balls into the top of his head  Because his hands are moving back and forth over the top  Only a few people will get this but screw it  He moves his hands over his head  Like Earl does when Earl's trying to think  Oh when Earl's thinking  I'm Mr. Bucket  He almost sounds like it  I'm Mr. Bucket  Okay  I just did a joke for about 15 people so  But the thoughts never enter my head  And that's not even a linger longer issue 
[00:40:00]  Trust me  That's just way way inside  He's always just scratching his head  And moving his hand across his scalp  What do they know from Ronifest  Trying to figure something out  I'm Mr. D***  God we all forgot about Oscar De La Hoya  See he's awesome  This is today's show we just decided  No Nose was a huge star at 6'10  Who?  Exactly  What?  Oscar De La Hoya was the star of the show at 6'35  And now it's all about Mr. Bucket 
[00:40:30]  That's a  No Nose  That's right  I'm Mr. Bucket  I'm Mr. Bucket  Post your balls in my top  I'm Mr. Bucket  One of my mouth I will pop  I'm Mr. Bucket  We're all gonna run  I'm Mr. Bucket  That's a wee  Hey the weeds  Mr. Bucket  The weeds  You're having fun  The balls will pop out of his mouth  I'm Mr. Bucket  The balls will pop out of my mouth  I'm Mr. Bucket  I'm always what I'm about  I'm Mr. Bucket  We're all gonna run  I'm Mr. Bucket  We're all gonna run  Buckets have fun  Okay  The awful children's noises you hear 
[00:41:00]  Screaming in the back  For Mr. Bucket  He's a hit  By the way  Running around with amounts  To kitty litter scoopers  Yeah yeah  To pick up the balls with  People on Instant Feedback  Completely amazed  That they didn't dump out of that  Because we're a professional broadcaster  What?  We're a professional broadcaster  It's a great commercial  The great thing would be  If someone put an M80  In Mr. Bucket's skull  And then the little snot  Put her hand out  For wee  We  Mr. Bucket's ball  And an M80  Landed in her little  Fat baby fists 
[00:41:30]  Serves your right punk  They don't really explain  That the balls go in  In from the top of his head  Yeah the top of his head  And then they shoot out  The top of his skull is removed  He has no top of the head  Right  He's a bucket  But they don't want to explain that  Because then the commercial  Wouldn't be as fun  Yeah  To listen to  I'm Mr. Bucket  I look like JFK in Dallas  I'm Mr. Bucket  The brains pull out of my head  My wife tries to get him  Off the trunk  You can find the ball  In the grass  He know  I'm Mr. Bucket  Mr. Bucket comes with 
[00:42:00]  The Governor Connolly buckets  Right in front of him  There's one little picture  Of this very bad boy  He's wearing like an awful  Danny Torrance sweater  And he's covering  He's holding like a yellow  It looks like the letter  It's like a hollowed out  Like a letter C  If it was a shovel  Yeah  Like it's like a little scoop  For the ball  To throw in Mr. Bucket's head  It's so it can pick up the ball  And he's covering his face  He's like freaking out  At Mr. Bucket  The glee is too much  Is it  Either that or he's afraid 
[00:42:30]  Of a talking bucket  With a mouth and arms  Like hey mother  There's a bucket speaking to me  You know that thing  That you throw up into  And you mop with  It's now talking to me  And encouraging me  To throw things in your head  The thing when you come home  On Friday night  And you're a little teetery  And you throw up  It sounds like what father  Says to you  Before he punches you  But I'm young  I don't understand  That'd be hysterical  Dad comes home all drunk  And throws up in your Mr. Bucket  And he doesn't know  It's a Mr. Bucket  So he picks it up 
[00:43:00]  And it leaks  Out of the mouth  Into the rug  Or you turn it on  And it just starts  Shooting his vomit  On the walls  And all over his children  Good old dad  Needed a bucket  To keep his fears cold  Mr. Bucket  I'll just use the Mr. Bucket  To keep my  Kid won't notice  My Budweiser's cold  Mr. Bucket  Mr. Bucket  I win  Hit her with the bucket 
[00:43:30]  You know this is very interesting  Because  Let's get the voice over  For that  You know there's  There's obviously  Some kind of double entendre  Thing that is being  Suggested there  Just to kind of make  This song fun  For the parents  To listen  You think so 
[00:44:00]  Yeah come on  They could explain  The game a little  Differently than that  How  Huh  How  What do you mean  That's what the game is  They're colorful  Plastic toy balls  You don't think parents  That heard this commercial  Back in the day  Aren't sitting there  Laughing going  Oh my god  Mr. Bucket  It's kind of like  The kid movies  They make today  They throw a little  That like adult stuff  Like Shrek  Knowing that it'll go  Right over the kid's head  Yeah  That's what I'm thinking  I'm thinking that today  Sure  Wee  Alright we gotta take a break 
[00:44:30]  Wee  No they wouldn't want  Anything  And nothing that's not right  Associated with the kid's story  Because parents would be  Dude never buy it  No  It's  I'm not saying  They  It's just  Just there  Where it goes over the kid's head  So they can't really complain  I think they just described  The game perfectly  Is what they did  You're crazy  This was purposely done  In my  My humble opinion  Yeah  What about the  Ballbuster game commercial  From 1975  What about it  Do you have that right there  Yeah  Alright hit that  Iraq  The name of the game 
[00:45:00]  Is Ballbuster  Are they playing the sting music  It's a family game  Fun for children  And for adults  It's exciting  Babe Ruth's last job  Before he died  You make strategic  Offensive and defensive moves  Then try to bust  Your opponent's balls 
[00:45:30]  It's as easy as checkers  But it's acting like pool  You're a ball  Buster  How the hell  Do they play that  Ballbuster  A great new game  From Ego  I don't remember  How the game was  But there's balls  You have to bust  It was like pool  Yeah  Something like that  I don't know  Alright we'll take a break  We'll get this stuck  In people's head today  It's Opie and Anthony  We got lots to do today 
[00:46:00]  The man waking up  During his own autopsy  Is just amazing  It's an amazing story  That people are talking about  You can almost say  Our Bud Dwyer  Made a Mr. Bucket  Out of himself  He shot the top  Of his head  A Mr. Dwyer  The gun goes into my mouth  The brains pop out  Of my head  Carl from Newport  Rhode Island  He writes  Gun comes out of the bag  A Mr. Bucket  Sorry  Carl from Newport  Writes  You guys missed the  We're all gonna run part  Like there's some kind of

[00:50:00]  Yeah  Oh wow  I'm Mr. Bucket  Out of my mouth  I will pop  I'm Mr. Bucket  Walk the new one  I'm Mr. Bucket  Yeah  People are suggesting  We play the bleep game  With this commercial  Yeah  Alright it might work  Put one of the guys on it  Yeah  See what Sam can come up with  Right there  Big news in New York  We got the Iranian president  He wants to  Go down to ground zero  And lay a wreath  Yeah yeah  The Iranian  Had muckety muck  Who no one could ever  Pronounce his name  Except Jimmy 
[00:50:30]  What's his name?  No  Let's all try to pronounce his name  Alright let's give it a try  Let me see  Alright  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  I'm gonna go with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  I think Jimmy's the closest  Mr. Bucket  Well he wants to  Why does he want to go down  To ground zero  And lay a wreath 
[00:51:00]  Because he wants to  Insult  This country  For a picture to be taken  Of him  At ground zero  Is a victory  It's a victory  It's a leader  Of a militant  Arab  Muslim  Country  A fanatical country  Religious fanatics  Being taken down  At ground zero  Where we were  Victimized  By a crime  Committed by  These same  Savage 
[00:51:30]  People  With the same  Savage ideology  And it would be like  A victory photo  It's like  The guy that takes  The picture with  The hunting rifle  And his foot  Up on the moose  That's what he's doing  That's what he wants  And I say no  What if he's being sincere  He's not being sincere  I'm just saying  What if he was  This is the same guy  That held our people hostage  This guy was directly involved  In the hostage taking  In Iran  Back in  79  The guy  Is a  A hostage taker 
[00:52:00]  He's a terrorist  He's now in charge  Of  Iran  Which  A lot of shenanigans  Going on over there  As far as  Giving weapons  To  Insurgents  And  Trying to get  Nuclear capabilities  For military purposes  The guy's just  But he's a rock star  People love him  And they interview him  You know  All our journalists  Love going over there  And interviewing him  Because he's a regular guy  He dresses  He doesn't dress  In that wacky garb  He dresses in western attire 
[00:52:30]  So he's more relatable  And that makes him  More dangerous  I think  And for him to go  Down to ground zero  No  You know  I might sound like  One of these dopes  That  Hey  Damon  You know  Because I hate  The over  Patriotic people  That are just that  Just because they think  It's the right thing to do  But this is just  It's an insult  I don't think  It's his place  To go down there  I think we should  I really believe  We should shoot him  And push him in the hole  And then just add one  To the death toll  But never mention him  As anybody  Other than just 
[00:53:00]  Alphabetically  I don't know  He never came home  We don't know what happened  He was in there  Looking around  And a bullet rang out  And well  It happens  It happens  How all these leaders  These leaders  Of these  Axis of evil nations  Just come to New York  For the UN thing  Because we get the  UN General Assembly  That just completely  Screws up New York City  Traffic and everything  And they just come to  America  Come to New York  Could you see if they  Held some kind of thing  In Tehran  Where Bush had to  Go there 
[00:53:30]  Oh yes  We will take care of security  Yeah sure you will  And enough with the  Wreath laying down  At ground zero  Everyone that wanted  To lay a wreath down  There has by now  Yeah  It's what  We're up to six years  Six years ago  Yeah and this  Scummy's been like  Filtering money  To the insurgents  Oh it's amazing  He's filtering money  To Syria  For a nuclear  He's awful  All the money  That Iran 
[00:54:00]  Is sending off  To terrorists  It's just amazing  So screw him  Shouldn't even let him  In this country  The UN should be put  Somewhere else  Quite frankly  In the middle of the desert  Just put it away  Not even in the US  Put it somewhere  Real effing dangerous  They're all  Bitching at us  All these stupid  Leaders bitch at us  And they can come here  And do whatever  They want  They got diplomatic  Immunity  They're treated with  The utmost security  Go put it in 
[00:54:30]  One of these  African nations  Where they hack people  Apart with machetes  And put tires  Around their neck  Filled with gasoline  And light it on fire  Most of these leaders  Hate America  But they come to  New York City  And enjoy the finest hotels  The finest restaurants  The Four Seasons  Is packed with diplomats  They drive like  You know  Really fancy cars  Cars will never drive  They can do anything  Because they got  Diplomatic immunity  So they  Don't have to pay tickets  They don't pay attention  To traffic violations  They get  They get  Armed 
[00:55:00]  Motorcades  Through the city  Whenever they want  But they hate America  Put it in Beirut  If they hate America  They should throw them  In a Motel 6  On the outskirts of town  Or somewhere  Somewhere in Newark  Or something  UN's new location  Darfur  Darfur  Put it in Darfur  I say  Newark, New Jersey  Hey  Slow down  They need some  Relative safety  But it's making a comeback  That's what they  But it's just  Constantly  The bad-mouthing  These people do 
[00:55:30]  And they  They just  Live like kings  When they come here  For this  General Assembly  Yeah  By the way  Did Angry Vince McMahon  Make this statement  The front page  Of the Daily News  Our message  To Iranian  Madman  If you even think  Of setting foot  Near ground zero  You can  Go to hell  Go to hell  That's right  I told you to go to hell  To hell  If you think  You're going  To ground zero  You got another  Thing coming  Haji  You can 
[00:56:00]  Go to hell  That's what he would  Call him  That's like  Saying honky man  Of course it is  But that's Angry Vince  He doesn't know  I noticed you've been  Working on the Vince  Accent too  Yeah  I love Angry Vince  You think  You're going  To ground zero  You think  You're going  Well you can  Just go to hell  That's right  Go to hell  No chance in hell 
[00:56:30]  They'll be laying  A wreath  At your grave  That's right  Your grave  Gotta reiterate  Everything  That's right  Does Angry Vince  Have anything on  Oscar De La Hoya  Dressing like a little  Girlie  No comments on him  He's a  Let's go to some  Dude in Jersey  Jersey what's up  Hey Jersey  Hey what's going on  Guys  Hey  Hey Andy 
[00:57:00]  I just wanted to  Just a little  Correction  Is that  Iranians  Are not  Arabs  What are they sir  They are Persians  And actually  Arabs don't even  Like Iranians  Then how come  They support them  Well it's a  Well they might  Well actually the  Arabs don't  Necessarily support  The Iranians  It's a different  Secta of Islam  But I mean  Believe me  They're all  That's a fun fact  Yeah  They're all screwy  But yeah a fun fact  Today's fun fact  Is that Iranians 
[00:57:30]  Are not Arabs  Well isn't Iraq  Part of Persia  Aren't they Persians  No  Then how come  I assume Persia  Also included Iraq  No  Well maybe  Back in the  Ancient times  Maybe it included  Some of that land  But the actual  Ethnic Arabs  Are not Persians  They're more  Persians  Are more  They're more  European featured  I like the cats 
[00:58:00]  There's been a lot  Of mission over the years  But they're Persians  Alright  Fun fact  There you go  Thanks  Love you guys  I can't stand them  Either though  How about that  How about I just  Put them all  In the same boat  That's an excellent idea  Punch it out boys  Alright  Religious fanatics  McFly from the Bronx  Here's a guy  That lingers longer  I say put it next  To the stone pony  Talking about the UN  Oh Jesus  There's a guy  That knows  Asbury Park  Asbury Park 
[00:58:30]  That place is scary  Not anymore man  Place scares me  They're revitalizing  Are they  That whole area too  Last time I was there  They said that  Hey Osama bin Laden  They just showed  A picture of him  I'm convinced  That that's a new  Osama bin Laden  Different Osama  Oh there you go  Look quick  I think they found  A guy that kind of  Looks like Osama bin Laden  That's not him  And they switched out  The Osama bin Ladens  This guy's healthier  He looks younger  I know people thought  He might be just  Dying you know  His hair and his beard 
[00:59:00]  I'm thinking  It's a whole new guy  Dude his eyes  Are different  He's got the big nose  And stuff  But it's even wider  Like Osama had  A longer  Thinner nose  Than this guy has  I think it's different  I think they did  They pulled the old  Dick Sergeant  Dick York  Bewitched  Move on us  They just throw a new  One day they just  Threw it in  And we weren't  Supposed to even notice  They threw in  A new Darren Stevens  And just made believe  That it was the same guy  Same guy  He came home  Sam I'm home 
[00:59:30]  And she was like  Oh Darren  And you looked  And went  No  The new Osama bin Laden  Just looks shorter  He looks shorter  He just looks shorter  They don't show him  Standing up either  Because the old Osama  What he was like  6'9 or something like that  And all the pictures  The old footage of Osama  They would show him  Like lounging around  In his cave  You know that lounging shot  Yeah  Where he's got his hand  Behind his head  And he's just kind of  Lounging on a rock  And then they'd show him  Maybe shooting a gun  Or walking around  Outside  None of that  This guy sits constantly 
[01:00:00]  He just sits there  I think it's a different  Osama bin Laden  Yeah  We should kill him too though  Don't get me wrong  Just keep killing  The Osama bin Laden  Just keep killing him  They'll just keep  Coming at us  Kill  Keep killing him  Man wakes up  During his own autopsy  This is an amazing story  We had it the other day  And we never got to it  This didn't happen  At the Mayo Clinic  Huh  They're making it sound like  I hate when I go to 
[01:00:30]  Like Drudge Report  Or something  And I click on a story  Going oh my god  That sounds horrible  Man wakes up  During his own autopsy  Yeah  And I find out  It was in Peru  Or somewhere  Then you realize  Oh okay  That makes total sense  Because they  They don't really know  They put a mirror  To his mouth  And see if it steams up  Do something  They throw sugar on him  And if demons don't rise up  He's dead  He's better  Dummies  In Venezuela  Venezuela sorry  Dead in a car crash  Same thing  Wakes up  Shut up 
[01:01:00]  My geography is way off today  In Venezuela  Venezuela  A man declared dead  In a car crash  Wakes up  But get this  During his own autopsy  According to the newspaper  El Universal  Medical examiners  Began the procedure  On Carlos Camejo  By the way  She didn't mean to say  Get this  We would have picked up  The odd part  As you said  Yeah hey  Get this  Hold on to your hats  Kids  You know  And he woke up  During an autopsy  What's the weird part  Yeah  What  Oh get  Oh  Then get this  Well we know  Something crazy

[01:17:00]  Yesterday man  Yesterday's show  With the pirate jokes  Had me just laughing hard  Really  Really  Hard  Oh this is for that  Chicken  Pittsburgh  Hell no  To H2O  Hell no  To H2O  It is an epidemic  Hell no  To H2O  Hell no  To H2O  Worse than cocaine  Hell no  To H2O  Hell no  To H2O  Man it's got no taste  Hell no  To H2O  Gotta go  When you serve  That H2O  Yeah 
[01:17:30]  Of course you do  They still hate that water  Yeah they sure do  No caffeine  No thank you  By the way  Nothing really new  With the OJ thing  He got released  They let him go  On what  Hundred and something  Thousand dollars  Bill  125 yeah  And then he took  A little plane ride  Back to Florida  Flew coach  Did he really  Flew coach  Well cause Fred Goldman's  Watching  Of course he's flying coach  Yeah it would have  Looked a little odd  Imagine the poor bastards  Guys sit next to OJ  On the flight 
[01:18:00]  Wow I'd love to sit next to OJ  Would you  Talk to him  He wouldn't  I don't want  No I don't want to talk about  I can't talk about that  Although he probably would  Such a braggard  All you talked to him about  Was Bill's games  Like why didn't you  Cut left on that  Like all you did was  Go over his awful mistake  He'd probably be all upset  That you weren't  Bringing up the case  How was old  Puddin' head to work with  And nothing's gonna happen  With this case  Anytime soon  This thing is gonna  Really really take for  Take a long time 
[01:18:30]  Well Opie  This is gearing up to be  The trial of the century  How could OJ get  Two trials of the century  Nah this is gonna be  Just one of those  Dumb cases  They'll plea it down  To nothing  Maybe like  Nothing  I guess he goes to jail though  But for  You think  Six months  Like a Paris Hilton jailing  Let's guess  I'm gonna go with six months  I think they're gonna  Give him something  I think they'll give him  A year  But  Yeah they'll give him  Like time served  Or something  Even though he's 
[01:19:00]  Just not in jail  I don't really get  That time served thing  Well it's during the time  You're on trial  When that person's  Not serving in jail  You're out on bail  So you're technically  Still  Incarcerated  In some way  Shape or form  I don't get it either  E-Rock's guessing  The ankle bracelet  Ankle bracelet  Yeah  How can I golf  Ankle bracelet  You're saying E-Rock  That would never be  An option for you  If you committed a crime  You know that right  I have to cut it off  With a hacksaw 
[01:19:30]  He can't get to the latch  Thank god  We just put this thing on  And we gotta get a larger one  His leg would grow over it  Like when a tree  Eats a sign  On the side of the road  Another fat joke  That's right  Fat boy  Oh god  Well that's a little brutal  Well  You know  Tough love with this kid  He was looking great  And his  Freaking weight's creeping up  I like the tough love  Without the love part  Yeah  He'd get scared  And chew through his own leg  Like some scared  Plump animal  Big fat panda bear 
[01:20:00]  And he'd chew through  The wrong one  And go  What happened  Roly poly  They're still tracking him  And he's got one leg  Because he chewed off  The wrong one  Because he was hungry  Alright  Well  I guess we decided  To jump at a time machine  And we're back  In the year 19  I would guess  79 maybe  We now take you back  To 1979  Are we actually playing  An Eric Estrada bit  In the year 2007 
[01:20:30]  Did you find the song  Yes we did  This is a  Magnificent day  And age we live in  Is this one of your  Favorite moments  In sitcom history  Well it wasn't a sitcom  That's why  That's true  It's like kind of  In TV show history  TV show history  Now the song  Is what it is  But the way he was dressed  In his disco attire  Was fantastic  And he's singing  Celebration  Come on 
[01:21:00]  He's only doing the  Come on fart  Oh here he goes  Oh alright  Sean  Look at him  Look at him Jimmy  To 
[01:21:30]  I didn't know  Eric Estrada  Perused our show  Back at WNEW  Ling-a-longa  Alright let's  It's time to come together  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow! 
[01:22:00]  Ow!  Exactly  Good  Goodbye  Yeah that was  That is a moment  In TV history  And they got this  Low angle  Light  The lights  And the crowd  To look like  Saturday Night Fever  So they're trying  To get like  This whole  Disco look  Oh  Alright  Hey uh  What was the  In show justification  For this? 
[01:22:30]  Why was he doing that?  Yeah exactly  There was  Chips is very weird  In that way  They would do things  And there was just  No reason  For them to do it  Do you know  Danny?  Well the episode  Was about a battle  Of the bands  And so this was  Eric Estrada's band  In the show  He lost  Who did he lose to?  I don't know  Jeez  Of course he lost  He didn't have time  To practice  I watched that show  Back in the day  He was never practicing  With his band  He was too busy  Riding the motorcycle  Being a cop  And picking up the broads  And shoving a sock 
[01:23:00]  On the front of his pants  He was the worst  Like he'd pull over  Girls and do  Everything that you  Get just getting  Thrown off the force  And arrested for now  Yeah  He's picking up broads  On the freeway  Hey you were speeding  How about you  My  Okay  Out of a ticket  Today's a strange show  It's moving really fast  Everything's moving real fast  At 6.10 this morning  It was all about  No-no's kidnapper 
[01:23:30]  I'm trying to remember that  I have no clue  I'm going to have to listen  We thought we would be  Talking about no-no's  All morning long  But that ended quickly  Because at 6.35  Oscar De La Hoya  Became the star  Of the O.P. and Anthony show  Because we found the pictures  And checked them out  Of him in a girly outfit  You can go to  Drunkenstepfather.com  To check those out  And then  A mere 15 minutes later  We started forgetting  About Oscar De La Hoya  And it was all about  Mr. Bucket  Mr. Bucket  The balls pop out of my mouth 
[01:24:00]  Mr. Bucket  Speaking of Mr. Bucket  They did attempt  The bleep game  With Mr. Bucket  Oh they did  How are we going to  Get away with this?  If we play the original first  That's a good idea  They'll figure it out  Down the hall  So Mr. Bucket  Was a big star  Of the show  At 6.50  And now  At almost 8 o'clock  10 to 8  It's Paunch Sing  And Celebrate  Paunch  Singing Celebrate  Here's Mr. Bucket  Again  A real commercial  For a kid's toy  From early 90's  Mr. Bucket 
[01:24:30]  That's right  I'm Mr. Bucket  Right here we go  Wee  Post your balls in my top  I'm Mr. Bucket  Out of my mouth  I will pop  I'm Mr. Bucket  Wee  Wee  Wee  Bucket  The game's Mr. Bucket  The first to get their balls in  And Mr. Bucket wins  But look out  Cause the balls will pop out of his mouth  I'm Mr. Bucket  Look out for that  I'm Mr. Bucket  Our ball is what I'm about  I'm Mr. Bucket  Wee  We're all gonna run  I'm Mr. Bucket  Mr. Bucket  From Milton Bradley  I know what the we is by the way  They're French children 
[01:25:00]  And someone said  Does this game suck  Jimmy speaks a little French  And some Greek  We played the bleep version  With that commercial  I would give it a try  See what happens  Same commercial  But a few bleeps  Mr. Bucket  That's right  I'm Mr. Bucket  I'm Mr. Bucket  Post your balls in my  I'm Mr. Bucket  Out of my  I will pop  I'm Mr. Bucket  Wee  We're all gonna  I'm Mr. Bucket  The game's Mr. Bucket

[01:26:00]  God that was good  All we did was add some bleeps  No dumps  No dumps  Alright  Mr. Bucket  That's a good one  Very good  Hey I don't know why  We're obsessed with The View  But we just are  Are we?  It's a girl's show  And Barbara's  I had a broads like watching it  My girl was noticing  Cause she watches The View  That Barbara Walters  This season  Is all about ageism 
[01:26:30]  Oh like  Ageism  That would be  Old people  Getting mad  That their age  Is being used against them  Yeah  Old people issues  Discrimination  Because of age  Is that it?  But that's not  What we're talking about today  They hired this dummy  Sherry Shepard  Enjoy the YouTube videos  Of Sherry Shepard  Talking about the  The earth being flat  What?  On The View  Huh? 
[01:27:00]  She is dumb  What?  She is dumb  The earth being flat  Really?  Yes  Alright  Yes  Sherry says  She doesn't know  If the world is round or flat  Nor has she ever thought about it  Are you kidding me?  Barbara Walters  Takes pride in hiring people  That she thinks  Is intelligent  Why?  Why?  How did that even come up?  Huh?  What year is this?  How did that even come up?  I don't know 
[01:27:30]  Let's go to the tape here  Is the world flat?  Is the world flat?  Yes  Alright  Just to set up  Yeah  Whoopi  Who's the new Rosie  Asked the question  Is the world flat?  Why would they ask her that?  Because I think  Whoopi kind of knows  That she's just a dummy stupid  Right  So Whoopi's like  Is the world flat?  And this is what  Sherry Shepard had to say  Is the world flat?  Is the world flat?  Yes  I don't know 
[01:28:00]  What do you think?  I never thought about it  Whoopi  Is the world flat?  I never thought about it  You never thought about  Whether the world was round or flat?  No because  But I'll tell you what I've thought about  How I'm going to feed my child  How I'm going to take care of my family  The world  Is the world flat?  Has never entered into  That has not been an important thing to me  You'll teach your son, Jeffrey  Right?  If my son, Jeffrey  Asked me if the world flat  I guess I will go  You don't give him  And let us already work this question out  I mean, why are we doing this now?  Oh my God  This proves it 
[01:28:30]  Men are smarter than broad  Ha ha ha ha  What the  What is she talking about?  Did she honestly not know  If the world was round or flat?  Are there people out there  That don't even know?  Some of the religious people  They also deny the existence of dinosaurs  Because it doesn't line up  With the timeline of the Bible  Yeah, but that's not even a biblical thing  I mean, it's like  It could be that mentality  That same  Just that complete idiocy  For some religious reason 
[01:29:00]  I think she's gone all her life  Without ever  Ever reading a book  That explains in any way, shape, or form  How the earth is  Is it round?  Does it rotate around the sun?  Or does the sun rotate around us?  I know that the earth is flat  And is balanced on a turtle's back  That's what they say  I like turtles  See?  Yes, yes  That kid knows  He knows  It's not stupid 
[01:29:30]  Well, according to Humpax from Whackbag  Humpax?  There's the Flat Earth Society  Who have been in the news lately  So people have been debating it  The world is flat  It was proven by Dr. Napoleon  After the Battle of Hawaii in 1962  Against the Peruvians  Ambient gravy  Thank you  I guess they were talking about evolution?  Where is that thing there?  Boy, some people 
[01:30:00]  They just refuse  Oh, here it is  Except like science  Science!  Sherry said she didn't believe in evolution  So Whoopi said  Is the world flat?  And this is her dumb answer  And then the next day  Because everyone's like  Did the broad on the views  Question if the earth  Yeah, round  So she had to kind of explain herself  The next day  Sherry, my darling  Yeah  Would you like to say something?  Well, you know  This is, again  What I love about this show  Because we have differences  And we love through it 
[01:30:30]  And we would  Differences maybe in political views  But there shouldn't be differences  In whether the earth is round or flat  That's not a difference  That's not an opinion  That's not  We'll just agree to disagree  I'll stay here  Because I don't want to sail off the end of the earth  You know, there are sea serpents out there  That protect the edge of the earth  And they'll gobble you up  And if they don't  You fall off the edge  All right, if the earth is flat  Where does the sun go  When you watch that sunset? 
[01:31:00]  It gets put out by some god  Yeah  Yeah  The sun god  Sun god  Works that  And then the moon god works the moon  We're at the center of the universe, though  On the flat earth  Oh, dummy  Because we have differences  And we love through it  And we were talking about  Our religious beliefs  And, you know, this is a little hard for me  Because I never had to defend it in public  So yesterday we were talking  And I was really nervous  And so you asked, Whoopi  Did I know if the earth was round or flat? 
[01:31:30]  And Barbara asked if I knew  If the earth was round or flat  And I was so nervous  All I heard was  How many triglycerides does it take  To make Pluto  When the robot doesn't come  And the earth's up  So when they asked me  I was like  I don't know  Why are they laughing at that?  They're laughing at her ignorance  Well, if you're too nervous  To know if the earth is flat  Yeah  When it's crunch time  Maybe you shouldn't be on television  Maybe you shouldn't be doing anything  If you could be  I've never been that nervous 
[01:32:00]  If Alzar Cowley was ready  To lop my head off  I could accurately answer that question  Yeah, that's probably  Is earth flat or round?  Around  It's round?  That's probably the only question  You could actually answer  In that situation  Yeah  And then she continues  To try to explain here  And you know  You have one of those  You know  Senior brain poopy moments  You know  And so  I think  I don't know if it was you  That said  You know  Sherry  The earth is round  And I was like  I know the earth is round  No, I didn't know  I know you know  The earth is round  Somebody said it to me  And I was just like  Have you ever been talking 
[01:32:30]  And you just had a black  A hummer  A hummer  A hummer  I don't think you have to learn  To be perfect either  Like you learn  You're just yourself  Sherry  I thought you handled that  So well yesterday  And you said  You know  Actually  My mind is full of like  Okay, what's my son doing right now  What am I going to feed him for dinner  Oh, shut up  Do I hate her  Why is it so hard  To do what people have been doing  For thousands and thousands  And thousands of years  Feeding their kids  And listen  If you're on The View  You have it a lot easier 
[01:33:00]  Than other people  As far as worrying about  Feeding your own kids  That woman is a blithering idiot  Elizabeth Hasselbeck  Is just the stupidest person alive  You're arguing over The View girls  I know  To put a bunch of fruits  But there's something about it  You can't help it  Yuck  My mind is full of like  Okay, what's my son doing right now  What am I going to feed him for dinner  I'm a mom  Like I think that is completely fine  To say, you know what  Today, I don't care  If the earth is round or flat  No, it's not fine  To say that  So if a guy said 
[01:33:30]  That women  Take care of their kids  Because they're too stupid  To do anything else  Or they can only take care of the kids  And not do anything else  Because they're  They're so self  Absorbed  In their children  That's misogynistic  She just said something  That was so misogynistic  It's insane  She's like  Well, she's  You know  Taking care of my kids  And what are they going to do for dinner  She doesn't have to know  If the world is flat or round  Oh, look at that poor little bastard  Jesus 
[01:34:00]  Oh, that's good  Which one  That's that little Iranian kid  Or Iraqi kid  Which one?  I don't know  One's Persian  One's Arab, by the way  And I think his father  Or somebody threw gasoline in his face  And then lit him on fire  Oh, I thought he was just  Rubbing his nose in poison ivy  No, no  It was much more serious than that  Oh, okay  He was like victimized  Yeah  Poor little guy  So he came here to this country  To fix him out  Yeah, because, you know  They could take him to Saudi Arabia 
[01:34:30]  Or any of those other Arab countries  They're Arab there, right?  I don't want to get it confused  With Persia  Douche  And they bring him here all the time  Yeah  All right  To this great country  That's just crap  To the rest of the world  This round or flat  I may not care tomorrow  I just want to know that  Well, if you know  That is  She knows today  Because people bashed her  And ragged her  And put it in her head  Ask her another stupid 
[01:35:00]  Easy question  And she won't know it  And then what?  She'll say she's nervous?  They should have put her on the spot  They should have absolutely  Put her on the spot  Yeah  Awful me  Fun fact  Today in history  Galileo was tried for saying  The earth revolves around the sun  Wow  They put him on trough  And then we got Matt from Buffalo  With a fun fact  Matt  Fact Thursday  Yeah  Earth is round  There you go  Wow, that's Sherry 
[01:35:30]  What is her last name again?  She is  Dumb as they come  Shepard  Sherry Shepard  Good hire, Barbara  Dunce  It's Opie and Anthony  Yeah, you're checking out Opie and Anthony  Greg Giraldo has joined the program  Greg  He absolutely  Been a while  Yeah  He absolutely killed on the Flavor Flav roast  Oh yeah  You were the best  Oh, well thank you  You were the best  You were  You were good  Yeah 
[01:36:00]  It helps to be racist  Yeah, when you get a good theme like that  Yeah  Where you can just be racist  Yeah  And no one's  Well, it comes from the heart, you know  Yeah  You don't really know  The stuff just writes itself on a daily basis, doesn't it?  It's hard not to just keep flowing  Dude, King Lear and a Forest Fire  Was just such a beautiful  Describing Flavor Flav, of course  Yes  The tax on Brigitte Nielsen  It was really vicious, man  It was truly  Oh yeah  Everything arose  I think we played some of your stuff 
[01:36:30]  Good  Do we still have that, E-Rock?  We can get another play out of that if you find it  Greg Giraldo playing Gotham Comedy Club here in New York City tonight through Sunday  Also, Dan's got an update on his mom  Yeah, well  When we left, left  Laughed, left  Okay, hold on  Yeah, yeah  I suck  God, I suck  Nathaniel was at dinner with his mother and his girlfriend  And they have a very strained relationship 
[01:37:00]  And he called his mother a sociopath  Yeah  Really?  You made it sound like his mother and girlfriend  Like one person, dude  I would have said slash  Oh, okay  Mother slash girlfriend  They got into a very uncomfortable situation  Well, there's more to it  Than comes from divorced parents  And he blames his mom on the divorce  He likes daddy much more than mommy  Mother  Mother 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, it's creepy because he calls her mother  If you're calling your mom mother  Yeah  There's a problem  There's issues  There's some sort of killing in your face  Yeah, yeah  You're definitely going to have the knife and the wig  And have a girl in the shop  Last we left you  Than went to dinner, yes  With his mother and his girlfriend  And they got into it a little bit  And they were talking about the divorce  And you were blaming mother on the divorce  Yes  And your mother walked out  Because you called her a sociopath  I called her a sociopath  And then I said I didn't like her  Yeah 
[01:38:00]  So she walked out and said  I hope you have money to pay for this dinner  And he was in Nantucket  And they were at a nice restaurant  And, you know, Than doesn't do that well with the show  So he was left with a pretty good bill  It just showed up  It's $4.40  Oh  $40  Wow  Damn  Wouldn't have signed on for that second bottle of wine  Was that three people?  Yeah  We're drunks  Yup  Really, that's what I'm thinking  Appetizers and booze  These are pretty upscale problems, huh?  I was dining with mother in Nantucket  When dining with mother in Nantucket 
[01:38:30]  One ought to keep one's card handed  He is using the proper name for mommy  Because it is Nantucket  Yup  I'm sure they all call their mothers mother  Mother  And you hadn't talked to her since?  No  And you got an update on this?  Yes, I still haven't  This is all via my sister  As all healthy discussions should happen between a third party  She says  Oh, she reminded me of the most hurtful thing 
[01:39:00]  The thing I hurt her with most was  At this dinner  I said  With a smile, apparently  I didn't realize I was smiling through this whole discussion  Was  I only pretend to like you so I could stay up here  Oh  You said that to her?  Yeah  Because Nantucket is a nice place to visit  Yeah  I only pretend to like you  Because I knew the break was coming up  You know, we had the vacation  I was like  I could spend X amount of dollars  To go to another place  Or  Just there's the psychological cost 
[01:39:30]  The non-monetary cost  Of having to hang out with mother  And  It probably would have been better  In hindsight  Just spending some cash  Yeah, I should have gone to Europe  Which you did anyway  Wow, 440 bucks now  And  Where does it stand now  With you and mother?  Well, she says  That  She will never speak to me again  Until I apologize  And you  Probably won't  Be apologizing  Yeah, that sounds like  A freebie for me  What do we call a stalemate? 
[01:40:00]  That sounds like  A pretty  Stable relationship  That comes down to that  Yeah  A lifetime of memories  Yeah  Unless you apologize over the check  It's all over  Do you have any desire  To have a relationship with her?  No  So you could care less  That she said that?  Well, I have to  I think, like, family functions  We're gonna have to figure something out  It'll just be weird  It'll ruin it for everyone in the family  Because all they'll be thinking of  Is like  How uncomfortable is this 
[01:40:30]  That the mother and son there  Aren't talking  Yeah  Looking at each other  I have to talk to the mother  And then I gotta talk to the son  And I can't, like, cross over conversations  It's like Connie in Godfather 2  Like Fredo wanted to talk to Michael  But he couldn't  So he didn't talk to Connie  So let me ask  Isn't it weird  Like, your mother  She, like, let you stay in her place here, right?  Like, you were living with her in New York recently  Uh, yeah, yeah  And she would let you stay in her place  And then  So she was okay to you  If you just hate her  Because of the way she reacted to your father 
[01:41:00]  Well, I have a feeling  Uh, he was okay with her  Because she has a lot of money  And, uh  And a really nice apartment in New York  And a nice place in Nantucket  So he tolerates her  But how about her with you  I'm saying, like  Because her obligation to you  As far as being a young man  Is over  Yeah  So she allowed you to stay at her place  Mm-hmm  And then she allows you to come up  And stay there with her  And she takes you out to dinner  It's always like a barter, though  It's like  It's a transaction  Everything's a transaction  So, like  The second I moved in there  The clock was ticking  And, you know 
[01:41:30]  The favors I would have to repair with  Started to  Like what?  Just any  It's just  She hasn't collected yet  Because I've been kind of a jerk  Like  Because  But it just  It wasn't like  Oh, yeah  You could stay  And there was no problem  It was just  She couldn't stop reminding me  That I was staying in her place  I mean  It's still cool  That she let me stay there  Without, you know  Having to pay rent  But  How long?  Four or five months  But, you know  It wasn't  But it's not like this 
[01:42:00]  Motherly gesture of  Goodwill  That's amazing  It's like saving up some points  So she could hit him  With  Hit you with him later  So then I  Will have to do something  For her later  Yeah  And this apartment  She doesn't even  Stay there  At that time  They never come  She uses it  When she comes to New York  Every once in a while  So  Any other normal relationship  Your mother would just go  Ah  I got an apartment in New York  You saved some money  I'll stay there  Yeah  She wasn't being put out  At all  At all  Like what?  She comes down  A couple times a year  If that  If that 
[01:42:30]  So this apartment  Is just sitting there  Than is struggling in New York  You know  He's making ends meet  But it would be nice  If he could live for free  And bank that money  He would use on rent  Yeah  But with his own mother  It has to be  I'll do this for you  But you  What do you have to do  For her  In return?  I'll destroy you at dinner  And you have to walk out  Yes  I feel like Robin Leach  Should be hosting this show  Yeah  I know  A different tone  Lifestyles are the  Lickered up and dysfunctional  Yeah  Dave in Massachusetts  The most hurtful thing 
[01:43:00]  That Dan said  Is that mother  Took them to a place  Where the seared tuna  Was slightly overcooked  Yeah  That's awful  I'm not earning a lot  Of relatability points  With this  No no  This isn't  So what would you  Have to do for her  Just because she allowed you  To stay in her place  For free for four  Or five months  I just  Some  Well  Eater box  Jesus  Oh  Now it turns  Not even  Not even funny  Well it's gonna sound 
[01:43:30]  Very selfish  Yeah  But just  Stuff that I guess  People would normally  Want to do  For their parents  Like what  Like  Would she require  A hug  Sam  Yes  She demanded  I'm drawing a blank  Just like  Just inconveniencing  Me  Like what  The only example  I can come up with  Is this very selfish  Sounding  Like she wanted  To be driven  To  To and from  Her knee surgery  Holy  Holy  Jesus 
[01:44:00]  She puts you up  For three months  And wants a ride  To knee surgery  What a demanding  Dude  Wow  You need a therapist  Jimmy called it a while  Wait a minute  So you  Why is that a problem  I can't get over  How the mother  Could ask for so much  Did she expect you  To help her up the steps  With bandages on her knee  What a pig  Why is that a problem  Let's get into this  Cause he broke her knee  In the first place  She slipped  Going to fetch him  Something  Yeah 
[01:44:30]  So wait  I knew that  I mean I knew  This example  Wasn't going to be  The perfect  Are you an only child  No you're not an only child  You have brothers  You're the youngest  Wait you didn't answer  The question though  Why is that a problem  I don't know  Like that was  That was  I felt  Normal  It's just  It's just the  It was the way  She told you  Were you coddled  Growing up  Um  More or less  Yeah  So you're kind of  Spoiled a little  Growing up  A little bit  Private schools  Yes  So you kind of 
[01:45:00]  Wow  I'm wondering  If there's any  Entitlement here  On fan's part  I'm not saying  That your mother's not  We've lost  Every black listener  We've had  That we've gained  Over the past few  Months  Why  They don't get this  Well the parents  Are divorced  That'll kind of  Bring them  So you  Wait a minute  So you were kind of  Coddled and a little  Spoiled growing up  So part of it  Might be your mom  And part of it  Might be like  You're a little  Bit of an entitlement  Mmm  You're bothered  Because you  Stan's not going to  Blame himself  No I'm not saying  It's totally his fault  I'm not saying  He's wrong about his mom 
[01:45:30]  Either  I'm saying it is  But he won't  Ever blame himself  Especially as your mom  Is getting older  This is the time  To start driving her  To doctors and things  You want to keep  You're locked in  That will  Yeah  You're really playing  This game  Yeah yeah  She's somebody  You really want to  Lock in  Well  She's not the real  Cash cow in the family  Oh father is  Oh father is  She's a beneficiary of  Oh okay  I get it  So Than kind of  Sighted on the right  All right  What kind of money  What kind of money  Is he got  When not specific numbers 
[01:46:00]  The look on the  I'm starting to think  That's the kind of thing  Nobody  I'm starting to think  How much  The only reason  He likes father  Is because father  Has the cash  No see  That's not it  He's nicer  Yeah  I just  I don't  I'm  I'm trying to  Divorce myself  From the concept  That she  That I need to be  Nice to her  Just because she's my mom  Like  I'm not a big fan of her 
[01:46:30]  You don't think  She's a good person  Yeah I don't want  To hang out with her  Where's your dad  She carried you  In her womb  That she's entitled  To your love  For the rest of her life  Yeah  Where's your father live  Connecticut  Of course  So couldn't he help you out  With the rent  Yeah  Okay  Well you can just ignore her  Ignore her  That's right therapy  I mean you know  Yeah  Oh you do good  I'm doing that too  Oh good it helps  That's what this is right here  I consider this  I never heard this 
[01:47:00]  Sound so sweet before  Yeah that's good  That really helps  Well it's kind of  It's just  It's the new gym  Yes  It's the gym  That goes to therapy  Gym  And then tries  To let  Let this little  Knowledge trickle down  To all of us  Because I started  Bringing up  Some stuff  From my childhood  And Jimmy  Had it all figured out  Just from a couple  Of therapy sessions  He figured out  That I was the child  Of an alcoholic father  So that gives me  These  That's why I'm paranoid  Right  And I have guns 
[01:47:30]  And I always think  People are going to  Invade my home  And that's why  I have weaponry  And you need to fix everything  You need to be in control  Of your whole situation  Right right  You never know when daddy  Might get drunk  And give you a good smack  That was it  Pretty much  It has nothing to do  With watching the news  And seeing home invasions  In my town  Shoot up 10,000%  That I wanted to buy  A shotgun  That's far  Of course it is  But I'm not talking  About that  I'm not talking  About the obvious  It's like  Hey look  We all are products  I don't know why  I do  Why have I laid on the floor  With bags under me  I don't know  It's like little  Psychological reasons  You saw your father  Being violent 
[01:48:00]  At least so you're  Afraid of violence  You don't have to be  A psychologist to see that  He's bringing it to the show  He says I have an anger issue  It's like  Come on  Yeah  He's now our therapist  Right  Jimmy  Will sit each down  And Than is now  Sitting on the couch  Quite literally  Yeah  Just lay back there  And Dr. Jimmy is in  Look  I don't want you  To go to therapy  Because I think  You could give us  Some really good radio  Man  I don't want you fixed  Don't worry  That won't help  No  No  Because she's  Yeah  She's not going  So I still have 
[01:48:30]  To absorb all that  Do you think  That's kind of  A morbid question  But it does happen  Do you think  If she passes on  That you will have  Any feelings of guilt  And feelings that  You didn't resolve things  Because that always  Happens with people  No matter how angry  They are at a family member  And they don't talk  To them and stuff  The second they drop dead  It's all this regret  And I should have done this  And blah blah blah  Zero  Zero  Wow  So when did you start  Zero  When did you start  Hating mother 
[01:49:00]  That's a good question  When did you lose  The love for mother  You say because  You blame her  On the divorce  But it sounds like  Maybe before that  No it's like  It just  I needed perspective  On the situation  And realized  That it's not normal  To like  Have every dinner  End in screaming  And you know  Yeah  I kind of remember that  Well  Not  I mean  If you're Italian  It is  Yeah  Exactly  Oh god  I've told that one before  I vividly remember 
[01:49:30]  A plate of spaghetti  Hitting the wall  And just running  Down the wall  And that is a memory  I have as a child  And you think  If you say  Poor Catherine  No more spaghetti  Hitting the wall  Is that spaghetti  Still hitting the wall  Anthony  We got Jim in Boston  He can relate to Finn  What's up Jim  What's up guys  Hey  Listen  My mother  Same way  Call me up  They just bother me  And call me  All hours of the day  I'm an only child  She would just 
[01:50:00]  Ask me to do  Ridiculous things for her  Like what  She asked me to  Take her for surgery  One day  What is the problem  With that  If mother needs surgery  I think you should  Give her a lift  Call an ambulance  Bitch  Huh  You there  Yeah  We're listening  Go ahead  She asked me  To take her  For surgery  One day  And  You know  It was  It was like  11 o'clock  In the morning  And then I had to wait  And then I had to go back 
[01:50:30]  And pick her up  I mean it was just  You know  And then she wanted me  To stay with her  And take her to the pharmacy  And everything  It was just a pain  And you know  I couldn't do it  All these cancer  You know  Getting cancer  Getting tumors removed  Doesn't always happen  That easily  Sometimes it takes time  I sense some sarcasm here  They're making fun of you  Tim you're making fun of Than  No not at all  You really believe this  Not at all  I'm telling you  My mother  Called me up the other night  And started a fight  With me over my son's birthday party 
[01:51:00]  What was the fight about  It wasn't even a birthday party  We're having a birthday party  For him on Sunday  And his birthday was on  Last Wednesday  And we had like a little cake  Because he's five years old  And then he told her  We're having a cake  And then she hung up on him  And then she called me back  On my cell phone  And started screaming at me  Saying that I should have  You know  I should have told her  That she was coming  She lives 30 miles away  Oh okay  Didn't invite her  She won't  Didn't invite her 
[01:51:30]  For the cake  If we would have  If we would have  Invited her  She wouldn't have come  Wouldn't have  It doesn't matter  Then you should have  Gotten out of the way  And invited her  And just saved yourself  The aggravation  You dope  What's the matter with you  I already did  You know what  I've done it in the past  And it doesn't help  All right  So there's no solution  Nothing you can do  For a woman like this  All right  All right  Thank you Jim  My father lived  My father was living  Way up in the country  In Connecticut  And he had cancer  And had to go in for chemo  But they didn't know  How many treatments  It would take  And I had to drive 
[01:52:00]  To take him into chemo  Which was like  A two and a half hour drive  So on the five  Of course it's kind of sad  He's died  On the last one  We're taking him  And they're like  Yeah I don't know  You really probably shouldn't  Come in for any more treatment  And like a tiny part  Of me had this  Enormous relief  Oh god  So that'll be it then  They pretty much said  Yeah this ain't working  And you were relieved  Because no more driving  No more driving  No more driving  To try to keep  My dying dad alive  Greg Giraldo everyone  Hey we gotta take a break  Greg Giraldo is

[01:53:30]  It's on like  Where is it  23rd Street  Between 7th and 8th Avenue  It's really nice  For everybody in the  New York area  We got Seth McFarlane  Calling in to say hi  Hey Seth  Hey  Of course  We're talking about  Family Guy  How are you Seth  I'm doing good  I could use about  A barrel of a wake  Oh you heard us do the live  Read for a wake  The energy drink  Yes I did  Oh why are you a little  Tired this morning  It's a you know  I'm out here in LA  It's about 530  In the morning  Why is that 
[01:54:00]  It's because it's like  830 here  Yeah I'm confused  It's amazing  It's just  It's a cruel  Joke of nature  Have you  Did you stay up  Or did you actually  Have to wake up  With this phoner  No I  I woke up  About 3 minutes ago  And you'll do this phoner  You got a whole  Like bunch of them  You got to do  Or are you going to do  This one  And then just go  Right back to bed  Yeah  Yeah  This high  This high energy  Voice that you're hearing  Is 100% real  So you guys  Just got like  Syndication  Were you syndicated 
[01:54:30]  Before that  Or am I saying  You just got it  Because it's CW11  We  No we  We just  Started  The show  Just went into  Syndication  I think  Last week  Yeah  Congratulations  No one's amazing  About that  I gotta jump in here  The show got cancelled  It did  Yeah  Got cancelled  The fans pretty much  Brought it back  And now it's a huge hit  And now you're up  To the syndication point  Syndication  Which you know  That's just the huge checks  Yeah  The huge checks  Yeah  We went from  Rock bottom  Up to the  Peak of where you want to be 
[01:55:00]  As a television series  So it's  Kind of nice  So do you get all the money  And all the voice people  Kind of sit there  And bad mouth you  Because they don't get  Any syndication money  Oh they're  They're incredibly resentful  Of me for my money  Yeah  Yeah but Seth does  A lot of the voices  On the show  Yeah but other people  Are in there too  But he does the main voices  He could get rid of  Pretty much everybody  Pretty much everybody  And just do all the voices  Yeah the show would still  Do just fine  How many episodes  Before you got syndicated  Seth  I believe  It's the first 
[01:55:30]  God  It's the first few seasons  So it's  Just about everything  Up to  Up to  Where we are now  I think  They have no problem  With content or anything  Some of these people  You know  There's always  Issues with  You know  If a show airs  Earlier in the day  There are certain things  You know  We air at 9 o'clock  At night on Fox  The syndicated episodes  They air a little earlier  In the day  There's some stuff  That you know  Obviously we can't do  So are they going  To cut it out  I mean  You know 
[01:56:00]  For the most part  The shows are  Are intact  I mean the stuff  That isn't in there  Is just  Stuff that  You know  The FCC  Is sort of  Decreed  Is not  Oh the FCC  They know creativity  Come on  They're the best  They just know  You're not afraid  About like some of the  Here it is  At night  On Fox  You could do some stuff  That's pretty politically  Incorrect 
[01:56:30]  And people kind of get  Why you're doing it  Because it's  The hour that it's on  And it's an adult cartoon  If you start putting it on  In the daytime  It's not even the daytime  It's 7.30  It's only an hour and a half earlier  Yeah  Well  Still  The children  That's what I'm talking about  The stupid children  Are you a little nervous  That you're going to be  On the radar  And people are going to say  Oh my god  Look at this tasteless  Blind joke they're making  You know  I think people say that already  I think  Yeah  I think 
[01:57:00]  You know  This is already  That crowd  Is going to be  They're going to be angry  No matter what we do  I think the trick is  And you guys have done this  Pretty well  Is to get  Every single group  Mad at you  So they don't know  Who's called to take  Or who's marching  Like if someone's  Protesting in front  They don't know  There's blind people  All the deaf people  Retarded people  The handicapped  Yes  They're basically  Sitting there like  You know  With a phone on each ear 
[01:57:30]  Yeah  Like your big episode  Of gay, black, Jewish, Asian women  And why we hate them  Oh my god  You know what  I tell you what  We need a story for this week  So  There you go  I might just use that  Jimmy Norton  What season are you in right now  We are finishing up  Writing season six  That's amazing  So season one through five now  Are being shown like  Well volume five is now available  In stores  But I'm saying for syndication  Like the whole first five seasons now 
[01:58:00]  Are released for syndication  That's correct  Did you get Seinfeld money  You know  It's not quite at that level  But it's  You know  It ain't  It ain't  He'd be mad  Where's my money  Yeah  The guy  Family guy  He took it  I heard he got 250 million  To go into syndication  Or is it just money  With Seinfeld's face on it  Might as well  Seinfeld money  Better get  Better Kramer's face  Get it  Yeah  That's right 
[01:58:30]  I'm sorry  Excuse me  I apologize  I shamed you into a laugh  I apologize  Isn't it  Move on  I apologize  You get it  Rib rib  Go ahead man  Sorry  I just said  They pay me  In DVDs  Of the first season  Of 24  Oh wow  There you go  Travis doesn't mind  That kind of pay  I've never seen 24  In love with the god damn guy  I heard it's good  And other people  Have said it sucks  You know  It's so funny  That's exactly 
[01:59:00]  Where I'm at  I've never seen it  And I've heard  Those two things  Do you watch  Other cartoons  Like stuff like  The Simpsons  Or do you  View that as competition  You don't want to be  Influenced by  You know  I  It's funny  I watch The Simpsons  Periodically  I don't  Catch it every week  But that's  About the only  Current animation  That I've watched  There was a show  Called  Home Movies  On Adult Swim  That I thought  Was hilarious  But it's gone now 
[01:59:30]  So I don't  Really  There's not  A whole lot of TV  That I watch  In general  Don't you hate  Them being called  Cartoons  Because I heard  Them say  You know  Animated  Oh did I just  Do that  It's an animated  You know  Your funnies  You know  The funny papers  Things that move  It's like  When you're a comedian  People go  You know that  Little sketch  You do  You put a red nose  And you dance  For the amusement  Of drunken patrons  Oh yeah  I prefer  That you call them 
[02:00:00]  Moving animated  Laughing illustration  Yes  Features  What would you say  Is the greatest  I mean  You know  You guys are like  A legitimate  Powerhouse sitcom  I mean  Even though it is animated  What would you say  Is the greatest sitcom  Of all time  If you had to  Pick one  Or one that you  Think you were  Influenced by  Probably all in the family  That's probably  The  That's certainly  At the top of my list  Yeah and that's something  They couldn't make today  No you're right  No  I mean  That's  Carol O'Connor's dead  Well  Besides that 
[02:00:30]  But yeah  That type of sitcom  There are things  There are things  That I think  They said on  All in the family  That probably would be  Flat out forbidden  By the FCC now  I mean  It's a lie  Charles in charge  I think was probably  My favorite  Yeah that's  Brilliant  Genius  It might bring it back  Now that Bayo's got  A little bit of a resurgence  Some heat  Getting some heat  The big argument  Seth has been  Charles in charge  Or Joni loves Chachi  Which is he  That's a tricky one  Cut for first  You know 
[02:01:00]  They're both  So damn watchable  But I would have to say  Charles in charge  Because  Because it has  Willie Ames  Who as we  Know is now  Is now Bible Man  Is he really?  Did he finally go that route?  Yeah he was pretty much  Bottom of the barrel  Plus he lived under the stairs  Didn't he?  He came up with a character  Called Bible Man  And yeah  He's got episodes  And everything  He's got a show  On one of the church channels  Where he plays a superhero  What the hell  Am I promoting this for? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah  Or look at you  Is he syndicated?  Wow it's amazing  How many people  No one ever is doing well  And goes  I'm just going to find Jesus  Yes  I really  It's always the bottom  Of the barrel  They've been on  The VH1 shows  And just showed  How their life fell apart  And then all of a sudden  Jesus creeps in  A prison seems to be  A good time  Yeah  Nobody ever gets Jesus  While they're committing  A rape or a sodomy  It's always after 
[02:02:00]  Once they get sentenced  While they're committing  It's like you know  Wow  You know what buttercup  I'm going to have to  Take a time out  For a second  I'm going to unball my fist  I'm not going to hit you  And I'm going to walk out  This door a new man  Never  You guys don't need me  For this do you?  No we like having you  In the background  What do you think of  The  Because you like  You got a great  Strange quirky sense of humor  And stuff  What do you think about  Some of the sitcoms  Coming out this season  Like that  Caveman one  I knew 
[02:02:30]  I knew that was  The one you were  Going to mention  Yeah  You know  Anytime  They can make  A television show  Out of a commercial  I think that's  The best of what America  Yeah  I was looking forward  To about five  Or six seasons  Of the  Where's the beef lady  Back in the 80's  Never panned out  Where every time  She just walks in  And goes  Where's the beef  And everyone laughs  And Yafit Koto  Runs out nude  And shows her  A different celebrity  Every week  Just runs out  And attacks her  Richard Keel 
[02:03:00]  Richard Keel  God  Yeah  Where's the  Time to make  The donuts guy  You know  Yeah  Yeah  He could have  Had a show  Here's a bit of trivia  He was actually  One of the guys  In the marathon man  Who recognized  Laurence Olivier  He was trying  To sell him diamonds  And then that other  Tattletail followed him  I know you  You murderer  Wrecked the whole deal  All right  I'm sorry  Yeah but  I don't know  It just seems  Like they've just  Run out of ideas 
[02:03:30]  Yeah  Yeah  It may be  I mean  It's  You know  I think  I do think  Part of it  Is  You know  There's just not  As much  You're allowed  To do nowadays  I don't know  Crazy and loony  Is  You know  The less you can do  Subversively  The more kind of  Crazy and loony  And you know  Out there you get  Which is  I don't know  It doesn't always work  But I  You know  I have not seen  The caveman pilot 
[02:04:00]  It may be  Absolutely ingenious  I'm sure it's hysterical  My guess is  It sucks  You know what  I hear they're doing  I hear that  They're doing interviews  And they're bringing  Around two of the  Caveman guys  And they  Come in character  And stay in character  The entire interview  They will not  Break character  Not a funny thing  For the entire interview  And I swear  If that's true  We are booking them  And I am going to  Hit them with a club 
[02:04:30]  And see if he breaks  Character  But they replaced  The original guys  From the  Yeah they didn't even  Have the guys  From the commercial  They didn't seem that bad  How bad  Did they have to  Sub  Where they had to  Get the actors  To play the caveman  You don't seem  Caveman-y enough  You kind of lose it  After 60 seconds  Which this annoys me  So much  Because I always  Wanted to do a sitcom  About the  Affleck duck  And now it's just  Going to seem  Like I stole it  You ripped that idea off  Nothing  Not even deserving of that 
[02:05:00]  Hey do you guys  Get away with more content  Do you think  Because the family guys  Are a pretty edgy show  Do you guys think  You got away with  A little bit more content  Because you're animated  Yeah  You always  You can always  Get away with more  Because it's an animated show  Yeah why is that  We're trying to figure that out  Well you know  It's  One step  One step  Removed from reality  I mean  Yeah  Peter and Lois  Are having a fist fight  I don't think you could  Really do that  With Ray and Debra  On Everybody Loves Raymond  We were trying to 
[02:05:30]  Tell everybody  That we were actually  Animated  On our show  So we could get away  With more  But it didn't work  We still get in trouble  That's an outrageous claim  It really is  Yeah  Alright what is  What's the big plug  Before we get you  Off the phone  The  You know  I guess the big plug  Would be our  Our hour long  Season premiere  This Sunday night  On Fox  Which is a TV station  Yes  Heard of it  We 
[02:06:00]  You know  We did this episode  That is basically  The story of  Star Wars  From start to finish  We did it  With the  Gracious permission  Of Lucasfilm  Took us about a year to do  Wow  And it's  I think it's  It's funny  And I think it's also  Might be  The most spectacular  Lookin  Hour of  Primetime  TV animation  That I think  You've seen  You actually got  Lucas' permission  Huh  Yeah  That's pretty amazing 
[02:06:30]  You must have not  Brought up that  Christmas special  Yeah  Yeah  They  I think they try  To keep that  Under wrap  Yeah  Unfortunately  It's everywhere  I love it  And you have to  Promise  If you draw  George Lucas  That you give him  A chin  Wow  Is he awful  From the side  It was  Fun to do  And it's  It's also  The first  It's the first  Hour long  Episode we've done  Did you get to  Go out to the  Skywalker ranch  Yeah  I'm heading up 
[02:07:00]  There  How is that  You know  I haven't been  I'm  You're gonna go  God that would be  The coolest  God damn place  I bet  Yeah  I've heard  Take pictures  Send me some  No I've heard  It's like  Neverland  Without the  Sodomy  So why go  Can't have all  The fun  Yes  It's like  Neverland  Without the  Repressed memories  Watch him  Makes the  X-Wing  Fighter  Disappear  Makes  Yeah it's alright  You put it  Wherever you want 
[02:07:30]  I'm just adding in  Well Seth  Congratulations on the  Success man  I mean it's really  Great you guys  Are like a real  Phenomenon  And with the  DVDs and the  Syndication stuff  And just  Congratulations  Well thank you  Very much  I appreciate it  Now you may  Go back to sleep  Sir  Oh thank you  Gentlemen  We'll talk to you  Again man  Yeah Seth  McFarlane  Take it easy  There he goes  I didn't realize  I was around  For that long  Syndication  That's nice  Dollars  Wow  That show is dead  In the water  Yeah  Cancelled  And they brought it  Back to life  And now it's just  Beyond huge 
[02:08:00]  Once you get that  Syndication  Alright  Dude they probably  I bet you  I don't want to go  I bet you  He got  They probably gave him  Five thousand dollars  Oh yeah  Easy  Couple two or three grand  Perhaps more than that  Jim  Let's say hi to Mark  In Jersey  Mark  Yeah what's up man  Hey  What's up  Listen  Where's Stan  He still around  Yeah  He's walking around  Go over there  Hold on  Hold on  We're running out of  Show here  He's wearing his  I hate mother shirt 
[02:08:30]  Yeah  Mark's got something  For you  Stan  Go ahead  Alright  Stan  You better  I would appreciate  Your mother  Why she's still around  Because if  Anything happened  To her  Like happened to mine  She'll be gone  Pretty quick  Oh boy  What happened  Pancreatic cancer  What's that  What happened  Pancreatic cancer  Now her ex-boyfriend  Came in my house  Early in the morning  And shot her in the head  Twice  Right in front of me  Jesus  What were you doing  While this happened sir  You can't say that casually  Well no actually 
[02:09:00]  That's what woke me up  Was her screaming  And then I jumped out of bed  And a second later  I hear two gunshots  Oof  So did he know  You were in the house  Yeah  Me and my sister were  Why didn't he shoot you  Cause she just broke up  With him like the night before  No why didn't he shoot you though  Yeah  You know you're like a witness  Yeah I went  He turned himself in right away  Oh he did  He didn't care  He just wanted her  And how does this relate to Than  Because if he doesn't appreciate  You know  What if 
[02:09:30]  Something God for happened  To his mother  And then something like that  Wouldn't he feel bad  That you know  Wouldn't he feel bad  I love that he uses that  As like a cautionary example  Of why you should be nice  To your mother  You really ought to be nice  To your mother  Cause you know what  You never know  One day her ex-boyfriend  Was gonna come in  And shoot her twice in the head  Extreme example  Sorry I think I can speak  For Than when I say  That he would paint a target  On her head  While she was sleeping  Than would you feel bad  If your mom  Was no longer with us  Um  If she got shot  In a violent crime

[02:20:00]  You know that I asked  For a pair of  Foo Fighter tickets  They're playing tonight  Here in New York City  And because of  Elliot Spitzer  They can't give me a pair  Wait a minute  Why can't they  You know he started  That whole plugola crap  Yeah but that's different  But now everything  Has to be documented  Everything  And there's these  Official forms  That are really  Really scary  I mean  Tracy the PD  Has to sign them  Elliot Spitzer's a cunt  Language  He is  Dude because  Fucking guy man  Because now you can only  Give out a certain amount 
[02:20:30]  Of tickets to staff  Or then it's considered  Plugola  It's this whole thing  You know why  They took something  That was a problem  And then they  They go into areas  Where it wasn't a problem  To try to fix it  Like the payola thing  And plugola  There was record companies  Coming in  And giving massive amounts  Of cocaine and money  To DJs  To play records  Okay  Understand  That could be an issue  They fixed that  And then just  Hey can I have a couple  Of tickets to go to a show 
[02:21:00]  Becomes a problem  It becomes a huge issue  But is it if you  So they've already  Given out  The amount of tickets  They're allowed to  To the staff  So they can't give  Any more to the staff  Staff of K-Rock  That sounds like bullshit  Isn't that amazing  What about the cocaine part  Is that  Yeah can we still  Get coke and  Right  That explains Mandy  Wait you can't even  Get free CDs  What's that about  Iraq  Most of the time  You can't get free CDs  Because the record company  Only issues you  A certain amount  And that amount  Has to be given away 
[02:21:30]  On the air  You can't give it to staff  Or it's considered  Plugola  Yeah  And it all has to be  Documented  Every CD you give away  You gotta explain  How you gave it away  To who  You have to have an idea  Their name  All their info  So you're telling me  That my friend's restaurant  Right  Like my buddy  Gotta play  And he's giving me  Some money  He goes throw out  Some mentions  And I'm doing it  Like there's a problem  With that  No that's fine  That's fine yeah  McDonald's  My buddy McDonald's  Yeah  My friend  His name is Ted King  Piece of McDonald's  By the way

[02:23:30]  Well yeah  So I guess  The rumor down in Philly  Is that Kid Chris  Is replacing us  Yeah they don't know  What to do with us  Regular radio  Doesn't know what to do  With us  And satellite radio  Really doesn't know  What to do with us  Where did that rumor  Come from  It's in the paper today  Supposedly  Write Kid Chris  In the search  I'm trying to find it  Just write Kid Chris  And you'll find it  Dan Gross  Kid Chris  Mmhmm  All you have to do  Mmhmm  I wouldn't be surprised  I guess  Why they

[02:25:00]  Okay  Go down  It's right here  Yeah I know  But go down so I can read it  94 WISP's Kid Chris yesterday  Told listeners  They expect this show  To go back to the format  All talk format  Former  Former all talk format  After the station reestablished itself  With it's new rock format  As it's been doing since last week  Last week Chris was the station's only host  It was not fire  Blah blah blah  There's also a rumor out there  That Chris may move  To the morning slot  When Opie and Anthony's contract  With YSP is up next spring  We asked Chris about the rumor 
[02:25:30]  And he indicated  There's no merit to it  But said that  If he and sidekick Thomas  Move to the morning slot  There will be a bloodbath  His war of course  Would be directed  At Preston and Steve  Well of course  It could get interesting  There you go  So I guess it is happening  Literal bloodbath  Like shooting and killing  Everything Dan Gross has said  So far  Has come true  Oh really  He's got some deep inside source  At YSP  So maybe they're floating that out there  To get some interest  Ah whatever  Do whatever the fuck you want 
[02:26:00]  Yep  What do you want from us  Alright  You guys gotta maybe give up  All this big fancy syndication stuff  Just get yourself a nice  Topeka  That's it  Right  Kick back  Nice small town radio  Yeah  You can do a nice remote  From the Otis Ford  Yeah  So where were we  Nightmare  A couple  Going off in a few directions here  So Miss Powell  Talk tomorrow  We want to give you ladies  More than $500  But as you've heard  It's too complicated 
[02:26:30]  To up the prize money  Can't do something  As illegal as that  Which is so stupid  Well  And we were also talking about  Greg Giraldo  How he's topical with his humor  Hilarious  Until that fucking ass leaky bitch  Called in  Yeah  She fucked up the whole flow  Right  Something so good  Her ass is watering  Yeah  You ever eat something so good  That your ass waters  No  Have you ever heard that expression  In your life  No  But I'm intrigued now that I have  It's awful  Can you imagine how hot 
[02:27:00]  She would have to be  For you to even be able to pull off  Even a fucking semi  Oh I know right  Something like that  She says something like that  This is good  This is gonna make my ass leak  Holy shit  What you'd be thinking of  Is your crack smell like hot dog water  She'd have to be so hot  That you'd be willing to lick  That liquid coming out of her ass  What is bonding a contest by the way  I don't know  I've been doing radio since I was 18  I've never heard bonding of a contest  It's all about so you can't fix it  And I get that they have to do that  Because people would be dishonest and shitty 
[02:27:30]  And give money to people  Who would give them a kickback  You know fine  But don't be such fucking faggots  Like we can  That's my whole legal explanation  We're just trying to take care of our hot listeners tomorrow  Don't be such faggots  Yeah  Your honor  If it please the court  Yes  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  My client's behaving like a faggot  Complete faggot  Please  Res ipsa loquitur  Ipsum de facto  That's right  Geraldo was gonna be a lawyer  I fucking forgot to be a lawyer  Yeah yeah 
[02:28:00]  I went to law school  I remember reading about  Hot chicks being only allowed to get paid 500 bucks  Yeah  Sure  Now when did you realize you didn't want to be a lawyer?  The minute I took the fucking law school test  You know  In 1990  I graduated in 1990  And I knew right away  That this wasn't gonna happen  But then I was like locked in  What was I gonna do?  Right  That's a lot of time to put in  That was a lot of time  And then you know  I ended up quitting  The most  I quit  And I started doing stand up  And I was living in this shitty welfare hotel  On 32nd Street  That my friend was renovating 
[02:28:30]  And I was living there for like 8 months  And then I got a deal  To do a sitcom  Based on me being a lawyer  So like I took that deal money  And paid back all this  It was like this whole full circle bullshit  You know  Like the only reason to go to law school in the first place  Is to get the paper so you can become a lawyer  You don't learn how to be a lawyer  So  And then you know  I also started handling a lot of murder cases  I'm losing  Where'd you go to law school?  Harvard  Do you know who I actually represented?  Wait  Wait  Wait  You can't just casually say that  I knew the answer 
[02:29:00]  But I wasn't 100% sure  Harvard Law School?  You knew Harvard Law School?  Yeah  Yeah  Gerald is a smart fuck  But he wouldn't  You certainly can't tell now  But at the time  Harvard Law?  Yeah  Yeah it was weird  And you know  You know the only legal case  I took all that Harvard learning  And you know what I used to  Was fucking Jeff Ross  The comedian  Got busted  Because he was doing some college gig  Way out in Long Island  And it was  Red Johnny and the Round Guy  And some kid in the audience  Was waving this like  Plastic fake gun around  And I guess it was  A very realistic looking fake gun 
[02:29:30]  So Jeff Ross  Like grabbed it from him  And he started fucking around with the gun  And they ended up getting tackled by security  And taken in  And you know  It was supposed to be a clear  Cut and dry  Menace  Whatever  It was just gonna be  Just going  And I'd never done anything  In the courtroom ever  But I knew a guy  Who was a DA in Long Island  And I told Jeff  I'll go out with you  What's the worst that could happen  We go out there  They have a picture of the gun  And the thing looks like a gun  So they put it into like  The fucking weapons charge category  And so I'm like  This is getting a little too heavy  They called me to the front  I'm like  I have no idea 
[02:30:00]  I thought we were just gonna say guilty  And I go  Well you can't plead guilty sir  That's a two year charge  Oh Jesus  You could've put him in jail  Like right there  Jeff Ross  Knowing Jeff like I know now  I would've just fucking put him away  For sure  But at the time  Wait because he was waving around now  Yeah  The gun charge  Yeah because on the picture  When they show the  You know  Like the person I knew  Was like a fucking two year DA  And they were allowed to dismiss these things  They're like  Just come down  It'll be no big deal  You don't even need a lawyer  But I said  I'll take him down  Just in case  So we went down there  And then the judge 
[02:30:30]  Just called us over  And that person  Was not authorized  To let it go  So he got bumped up  To like the gun charge division  Or whatever  So we had to like plead  I had to plead  You know  I have no idea  What I'm doing here  Plead  I have no idea  Plead  Plead retarded  I had to plead  I had to plead  I said  Your honor  I was just telling dick jokes  On a milk crate last night  I have really not the guy  To be settling this legal issue  And we had to go back out  And then Jeff  People wanted to plead guilty  Just to get it over with  Because there's a little  Probably  Oh that's a great idea  So we ended up  I think having to get a real lawyer 
[02:31:00]  And come back  Like a month later  Obviously  It wasn't even his fake gun right  It wasn't even his fake gun  No  But for whatever  Oh and his co-defendant  Had a record  That was the other problem  The other kid  That he was fucking around with  The kid that had  You know  Gone to jail for something  But they know Jeff was a comedian  And they knew the context  Of what happened  Yeah they knew it  But  I mean he ended up  Not doing any kind of hard time  But just  They couldn't  For whatever reason  When you have a gun  That looks like a gun  And it's in the file  That you know  The kid two years out of law  Two months out of law school  Can't just clear it 
[02:31:30]  You know  They gotta go through  Some superior  Or something  That is amazing  Yeah I handle that  And I handle the  Vince Champ rape case  I don't know if you remember  What is that  It was some other comic  Did you  What is that about you  Serial rapist  Huh  A serial rapist  Yeah  He was a comedian  This guy was a comic  And he was traveling around  And he was like  Raping  You know  You're like  Oh this guy's out there  Raping all the college kids  Like well that's what we all do  You know  And they're like  No no I mean  Physically raping them  He's actually raping  He was a comic  And after his show  He was actually 
[02:32:00]  A rapist  Vince Champ  From town to town  Yeah he was traveling around  From town to town  He's still in jail  I think  The guy's 25 years  He got a long time  And you guys knew him pretty well  I never met Vince Champ  But it was funny  When it all happened  They kept showing this evening  At the improv clip  For them peanuts  How am I going to stay  For them peanuts  I want to slow this down  A little bit  So a guy who's making people  Laugh from town to town  After the show  Is a predator  Raping women  And he got caught  Hopefully one of our guys 
[02:32:30]  Is getting something  On Vince Champ  Because I mean  I don't know  A comic's a pretty good  Cover for a rapist  You're all over the place  You travel around  You have reason to be  In a place  You're probably coming  Close to raping people anyway  So it's  I think what he would say  Is could you pray for me  At the end of it  He would ask him  To pray for him  This is what I heard  And it somehow  Got connected on the internet  Like somebody quoted that  And said  I think I was raped  By this same guy  Because he asked me  To pray for  And I don't remember  Exactly how the  Description of the car 
[02:33:00]  But then they connected  Him through that  And his college schedules  Would kill him  Because they knew  Exactly where he was  Yeah where he was  And what a coincidence  When someone's  Got to call Roger Paul  For your  Some national booker  To go through your book  Wait a minute  I think we got a rapist  He did a lot of colleges though  I mean he obviously  Yeah well  That's what bummed me out  The most  And you did his case  For real  No I'm kidding  That would have been  A hell of a  Hell of a step up  A serial murderer  I don't know  If you're helping comics  Here and there 
[02:33:30]  Who knows  No yeah  Was he black  Someone's asking  Hopefully  Yeah he was  He was a black guy  I believe so yeah  I don't know why  They're asking  But he came in  Yeah he did  I mean he's still in jail  20-25 years  It was like multiple  Council  Oh he was a bad boy  Wow  He was naughty  I mean  He was naughty for sure  He really was a fresh one  Facebook was fresh  He was a ne'er-do-well  If ever there was one  How uh  What happened  I don't know how  When did that happen Greg  That's like 8 years ago  About yeah  At least 8 years ago  He'll probably be out soon  I mean  Ugh

[02:35:30]  He was really good  Let's say hi to  Jeff in Illinois  Jeff  Hey Greg Deralda  How you doing this morning?  Good how you doing?  All right man  I just wanted to give you props  I watched that Comedy Central  Flavor Flavor Roast  The other night  And I'd always heard it on  I'd always heard it on the radio  But when I saw it  And I saw the look  That Carrot Top was giving you  When you started  Busting his chops  Yeah  It looked like he wanted  To come across the stage  And choke the shit out of you 
[02:36:00]  Yeah he  He was shocking  He was like  Shockingly upset  Did you see?  Yeah yeah  Tellier's upset  You know like man  It's bad enough  When any normal civilian  Gets like blown away  It's the tone of a roast  But when a comedian  Is sitting there like  You didn't think this shit  Was going to come up?  Yeah yeah  I mean  Why do you make me feel bad  About doing my own job?  And it is like  It's like  Carrot Top  It's your Carrot Top  It's like  Why wouldn't you get goofed on  In a room?  Of course  You have to  I even told  Because he's a very nice guy  I even told him before  I said you know  Some of these things 
[02:36:30]  Are going to get  I said I got a lot of stuff on you  You know  You're going to hear a lot  About yourself I'm sure  How did you know  He objected?  How did you know  He objected?  Because he looked at  Literally  Because if it wasn't for the surgery  That had sealed his tear ducts shut  He would have started crying  Like he literally  He got very upset  Well let's say hi to John Jersey  He's saying the same thing  John go ahead  Dude I watched it last night  I've got it on my iPhone even  But I  Yeah  When he starts his set man 
[02:37:00]  It was like  He was all pissed off  Like you could tell  He was derailed by it  Until he went to his prop  Trunk  Yeah  You know  The other thing he kept saying  Because he was like  Sort of right next to me  And at one point  He's like  Dude what are these guys  You know  Making fun of me  They're all these fat bald guys  Why am I  Why are they making fun of me  For being in shape  And looking good  I thought  Are you a child?  Oh wow  Are you a professional comedian?  Are you a child?  Exactly  You're right  You're more muscular  Than some of us  Yeah  Yeah but he has  All sorts of other things 
[02:37:30]  Going on  Doesn't he have like  Permanent mascara on  And stuff like that  Yeah he's got all kinds  Your name is Carrot Top  You're fucking calling  It's a miracle he got away  As easy as he did  I thought  Yeah  Go ahead John  Yeah I was going to say  Greg  I know you can throw me down  But you're starting to look  Like a fat  Stuttering John Melendez  A little bit on that special  That's rough  Yeah well that does  That does hurt  On a number of levels  But  Holy shit  I agree with you  Look at that picture 
[02:38:00]  Of Carrot Top  That Iraq just popped up  I think he finally had it  With people making fun of him  That guy's ridiculous  That's what  Is going on with this guy  Look at him  He's fucking ripped  Yeah he's totally jacked up  He wasn't like that  When he first started out  In the business  No but that's also  Roids and shit  That's not just  Normal weight  That's it  He's done bad  It has to be Roids  You can't get like that  Here's that V  Yeah  Goes down to the cock  Yeah the old cock muscle  Carrot Top  Dennis from the Bunny Ranch  See Carrot Top  Goes he fucks a lot of broads

[02:44:30]  That the photos  Are a really bad  Photoshop job  And Demandon  In a letter  Posted at  USmagazine.com  That they'd be  Taken off the net  A little late  How could it be  A really bad Photoshop job  It looks like  A really good Photoshop job  If nobody can tell  The difference  That's a good Photoshop  Job job  Yeah  Hold on  I got a text  From my ex-girlfriend  Oh  About something  Totally unrelated  Right  About a guy  She used to date  Before she knew me  And I was talking  About something  I was talking  About a guy  Who cross dresses  And this is 
[02:45:00]  What she sent me back  I fucked him  In the ass  With a strap on  Where are the pictures  Wow  I didn't ask  For the guy's name  No no  But  Man that's something  Very rich boss  She used to date  Rich boss  Yeah  Hey we got the  Great Ronnie B  On the line here  Hey Ronnie  Hey what's happening guys  Hey Ron  Mr. Bennington  What do you say boys  Well we started  Talking about  Vince Champ  And someone said  You might know this guy  I know him very well 
[02:45:30]  I know him of course  Years ago  And it was a very  Very weird story  Because he was a guy  That like everybody liked  He was the last guy  Anybody thought  Would have been involved  In something like this  Yeah if you weren't  Listening earlier  Vince  A stand up comic  Touring a lot of colleges  And after the  After his set  Pretty much  Was a predator  And possible  Well I guess  He went to jail for it  So he was caught  Raping women  Yeah  He did go to jail 
[02:46:00]  For it  And here's the thing  If we were making  A movie about Vince  Black girl  Would be playing  The part of  Vince Champ  You know what I mean  Oh really  Yeah  Vince was incompetent  A black guy who  Comfortably moved in  And out of  White society  And believe it  Everybody liked him  He was everybody's  Best friend  Nobody could say  Enough good things  About him  I would say  Everyone liked him  There Ronnie  Probably a couple of 
[02:46:30]  Girls in some of his  Towns that he visited  He was so likable  That even these girls  To this day  Can barely bring themselves  To say something bad  I'm sure his percentage  Is way up there  But I would say everybody  He was one of the  Sweetest rapists  In all honesty  It's true  Because when this  Happened  Everybody went  Everybody who knew  Him immediately said  This is some kind  Of midwestern  Let's grab the first  Black guy we can find  Nobody  Yeah  Knew him  Fell for this  A 
[02:47:00]  He had the nicest  Demeanor  B  He left with a  Different white girl  Every night  So  He was getting laid  It's not  It's like when  Those people were saying  Rape isn't about sex  It must be true  Because he had  Sex all the time  He always had women  Hey Ron  How did he finally  Acquire  I mean  I read something about  It was  He had some weird  Ritualistic thing  He would say  After each rape  And someone connected  It on the net  Well  What happened was this  And it was actually  Like pre  Before the net  Got bigger 
[02:47:30]  Just right about  The time  So  It was like  It was like  That era  Where like  You wouldn't put  Together things  As quickly  Or couldn't get  Information as quickly  But after  He raped them  He had them  Pray with him  He was wearing  Like a key mask  They had to pray  But  The way that  They basically  Found him  Is  So many of these  Rapes were taking place  In these like  Little colleges  In you know  Towns in like 
[02:48:00]  Nebraska  Or someplace out there  Where they didn't  Have black people  And  The cops  Finally got his  Calendar  His  His fucking  Calendar  That he had  Was showed  Every night  Everywhere that he  Was  On  On his tour  That's good evidence  Perfectly  But Rob  What made them  Suspect him  Do you know  They were going  How could there be  A black guy  In this town  What  You know  You know 
[02:48:30]  Midwestern  Bible colleges  You know  These weren't  Taking place  At like  The University  Of Kansas  These would be  Like little towns  I've never heard of  Before  And they're going  How could a black  Guy be here  Did he drive in  Did he  And then they  Start put together  Well you know  Remember that was  Comedy night  Comedy night  We had that night  And  It's fucking  Just  I mean  It was the worst  Stupidest thing  That you know  Crime 
[02:49:00]  That you could have  Done when you're  The black guy  How many  How many women  Did he rape  You know  I don't remember  The whole thing  But it literally  Was a string  I mean  I remember  It made all  The news stories  And  And shit like that  So  It was a big  Enough thing  That it got out there  As you know  Making the news  So it was  You know  When you get  Called serial  You've been doing  It for a little while  Yeah  True  But I don't know  I guess they  Tied it back to  You know  He had some  Strict upbringing 
[02:49:30]  Blah blah blah  I don't know  That whole  Pray with me  Thing is so  Like weird  Yeah  You rape a woman  And then  Here pray with me  That's some bullshit  Like this happens  To both of us  Yeah  Yeah  Instead of going  Cleaning up  And trying to  Put this out of your mind  Now get on your  Next to me  Yeah  I'll pray  I'm sorry  Yeah you're not  Going to be going  To the hospital  For a rape kit  Yeah cause now  I need comfort  Not you  Yeah  Jesus  You would have  Said later 
[02:50:00]  Like if you  Didn't know the truth  You would have  Went on the  Fucking  Stand for the guy  And said  This could never  Have happened  That's amazing  Was he a funny guy  Nah  He was fucking  Terrible  But you know  He was black  And he was nice  To people  You know  Like hey  How's everyone  Doing  I know  I'm the only  Black guy  You know  He would really  Lean on that  I'm the only  Black guy  So the fucking  You know  Normal people  Would just  Giggle and go on  And you know  Feel like  Oh this is relaxing  You know 
[02:50:30]  He would do  Like self  Depreciating  Black guy jokes  And you know  How people  Love that  Oh yeah  Later he would  Rape them  Now who's laughing  Now what's  The fucking joke  Terrible  Fucking  God damn  Great  So Ronnie  You knew him  For a long time  Or like  You could  I would draw  The draw  Those in the studio  Yeah  He owned Ronnie 
[02:51:00]  On the comedy club  Yeah  I know  For a lot of years  And you know  Never a problem  Real professional guy  Used to help  The other comics  Get into different  Clubs around the country  Everybody  But nothing but good things  About the guy  How long did he get  You fucking have no idea  Who people are  How long did he get  You know  I know it was like  You know  Decades  So I don't know  If they kept him  All that long  Because this had to be  Over about 10 years  Now  So he's probably  Still in jail 
[02:51:30]  Yeah he should be  I mean I can't imagine  Ever  Feeling fucking safe  Around the guy again  Because  Like how are you  Going to rehabilitate him  When nobody saw it  Happening  You know  Not like he was  Running through town  Fucking  Frothing at the mouth  Right  Wow  I wonder if he's  Working on his act  That would be a good hook  Nowadays that really  Would work  Yeah  Redeemed rapist  Having 20 minutes  Rapist  With all the time he has  He should come out  As the greatest comic ever 
[02:52:00]  The greatest comic rapist  In the history of the guy  This was honestly like  He was trying to be like  The black Brian Regan  Like if you know how  You would never believe  Wow  Did anything wrong  You know  Well Regan's got his dark side  We all know that  You know  Boy  I'd love to talk about  Some nights out  With Regan  Oh Regan could go nuts  I've seen him once  Have two Amstel lights  Is that it  I remember  Walking out of a  Bar  And it was  Daylight out

[02:59:00]  If I can walk away  For a while  I'll let him scream stuff  Very very rare  What can we expect  On the Ron and Fez show  Today  Well Fez hasn't slept  In two days  So  Oh Jesus Christ  See how the Fez  Hold up  What happened  Well we'll see  How his health is  After not sleeping  For two days  Why isn't he sleeping now  Two days  I'll go to a little contest  To see if I could help  Everybody focus  On the show  I wasn't happy 
[02:59:30]  With their focus level  So I had him stay up  For a couple nights  Oh great  That helps  It's really gonna do well  In that little fucking  Cracker box you're in  For a show  Yeah  It's really just  Killing time  Until the merger  I really think  Yeah that's what  We're all doing  Yeah  We are all just  Killing time  Until this merger  Happens or doesn't  Happen or whatever  Uh huh  What happened the other day  We lost power  Or something  Somebody cut through  A power line over there  Never have any

[03:04:00]  Rene.  Jack M. is today's complainer.  And yet another 20 minutes of radio followed by a break, only to leave promptly at 11. 
[03:04:30]  I reiterate, fuck you guys.  Shut the fuck up.  You're lucky we go to 11.  I swear to God you're lucky we go to 11, because we don't even have bosses at XM right now.  We can leave at 10 and no one's going to tell us, you know, guys, we've noticed that you've been leaving at 10.  And, you know, the contract states you've got to be there at least to 11.  Yeah.  I swear to God.  We'll do it tomorrow.  I'll prove my point.  We'll leave nice and early tomorrow.  And guess what?  We're not going to get one phone call about it. 
[03:05:00]  Exactly.  So fuck off.  Rene, how are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  Greg Giraldo.  You know him?  Hi, Rene.  Hi.  She doesn't know much.  That's why I said that.  I don't know much.  I don't know anything.  We never made out or anything, did we?  No.  No.  No, we're good.  Okay, cool.  Would you make out with him?  We haven't forced to pray with someone after a comedy show?  You look prayerful.  You look like you need to meet Jesus.  Oh, no.  I'm not going down that road.  No?  Do you find him attracted? 
[03:05:30]  Jesus?  Yes.  Jesus.  Jesus is hot.  Would you give Jesus a hand job if he was willing?  Hmm.  I think I would.  It's not gay if it's the Lord.  No.  As long as I'm not going to hell.  Yeah.  I'm going to help.  Why would you go to hell?  I think he'd appreciate that.  I don't know.  All right.  So we told you to bring in something funny.  Yes.  So what did you bring us?  I found this video a while ago, but I kind of ignored it.  So I saw it this morning and acted quick. 
[03:06:00]  And it was a kid in Walmart just picking up the phone over the PSA.  And PA, sorry.  And just singing Baby Got Back.  I thought that was funny.  Spoiler alert.  I like turtles.  Spoiler alert.  I like turtles.  All right.  Well, let's take a listen.  This is what Renee finds funny, Anthony.  I like big bucks and I can't not lie.  You other brothers can't stand out.  When a girl walks in and anybody wasting around, thinking in your face, you get sprung. 
[03:06:30]  I want to pull up front because you notice that butt was stuck.  Excuse me.  Oh, no?  Oh, I thought it was to play with.  No, it's not.  Okay.  Sorry.  Let's go around the room.  All right.  Well, Jimmy threw his mic away.  I thought that was funny.  He shot his head in his hands.  Oh, man.  Jimmy?  Comment?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, man.  All right. 
[03:07:00]  Well, I'm trying to think of a situation in which I could even laugh with that playing  somewhere in the country.  Why is it funny?  Because it's just, I thought it was funny.  A kid going into Walmart, he has nothing better to do with his life.  It's pretty sad, actually.  I'm singing Baby Got Back.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why would he have nothing better to do with his life?  Maybe he just happened to be in the store and he was looking for something and then said,  well, while I'm here, maybe I'll have a little fun with the PA because I see it's  right over there.  He could do that. 
[03:07:30]  But I'm thinking to myself, what gives you this idea that you have to go into Walmart  and-  To make a video and put it up on-  And cause some ruckus.  On YouTube?  There you go.  Yeah.  That's why he did it.  Boy, you're on the hot seat, huh?  Oh, this is burning right now.  Wind it over.  They raised a good point.  She's like, I thought it was funny and I'm like, why?  And then she just kind of reiterated what the video was.  Well, because I love Walmart and he's saying Baby Got Back.  Why not?  It's just funny.  I thought it was funny. 
[03:08:00]  I laughed.  And there you go.  I did my homework.  And there you go.  Did I get an A?  Oh, is that it?  I wouldn't read instant feedback anytime soon.  Reading from Whack Pack.  Holy shit.  Of all the videos online, she found that one fun.  Well, there's a part two.  Wait, we're watching it now.  Okay.  All right, so now I couldn't see it before the guys.  Oh, there he goes.  And he's got curly hair.  So now it's just like, it's a really fat guy with curly hair.  Who doesn't make me laugh on any level.  Well, there's more, Jimmy. 
[03:08:30]  There's more.  There's more.  He tries it again on another phone.  All right.  I don't know.  Attention, shoppers.  You're in for a special treat.  I like big bucks and I cannot lie.  You other brothers can't deny.  When a girl walks in and then itty-bitty waxing around,  taking me up, they keep getting strong.  Wanna pull up, bro.  That butt was stuck.  Deep in the bridge, she's wearing.  I'm hooked in a bitch up there.  And ooh, baby.  I wanna get with ya.  And take your picture.  This woman's always trying to warn me,  but that's what I'm talking about.  I thought it was funny.  This friend with the camera finds it funny. 
[03:09:00]  I thought it was funny.  You folks fell on your face.  You get an F-minus in my book.  That's the kind of thing that pilots on JetBlue do.  Yeah, they do.  They're always trying to be so funny all the time on JetBlue.  Yeah, just shut the mic off and fly the fucking plane.  I hate to say this.  That's funny?  I wouldn't say, I mean, she's fucking painting it like it's a Peter Sellers film.  But I didn't, once watching it and then he did it again, 
[03:09:30]  it's just this fat, obnoxious idiot.  It doesn't suck.  Like, it is kind of amusing.  It's not hilarious.  The video's funnier than just hearing the audio.  Yeah, because just watching a guy make that noise is shit.  But, I mean, when you're just watching a real fat kid in the store just being a dick,  I kind of appreciate that.  Yeah, but there's 8,000 of those up on any video site.  Like, where it's kind of funny, but you need to watch the video.  A java wheel from Boston.  She better be hot because this video sucks. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, I guess that's why you get a pass.  You know that.  If you're ugly, man, it would have booted you a long time ago.  Well, if I was ugly, would I be out of here the first day?  Not the first day.  No, we should see the other one we have in here.  You get that five-year-old Iraqi kid with tits.  Oh, my God.  Wow, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  So, I guess I have more work to do.  We don't even know what you do.  You just look good around the hallway.  Oh, come on.  What do you do? 
[03:10:30]  And don't say the bagel and club soda.  Oh, that's nothing.  No, I'm doing production.  Sam helped me out with the video today.  Oh, did you, Sam?  Yes, he did.  Again, looking for stuff, looking for video, audio, anything possible for the show.  Articles.  So, the whole time you've been here, have we ever used anything that you've come up with?  Yes.  The, oh, God, what was the first one?  The, uh, mystery, the, guess the sound.  It was the guy with the fetish. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, yeah, that was pretty good, actually.  Well, that was good.  Okay.  Yeah, that was good.  I kind of do look like alfalfa.  Oh, come on.  No.  A little bit.  Freckles?  A little bit.  Nothing sticks out?  No.  Oh, that's a good, she's very pretty, but it's, it's, it's, you're hot as alfalfa.  There's something very weird about that.  Yeah, you'd be like a, a cute alfalfa switzer.  It's better than being a cute spanky.  Jesus.  God.  Uh, well, Jay from Florida writes, other things Renee finds funny include AIDS, starving children, 
[03:11:30]  and comedy shows on the CW, so, you're in good company there.  Oh, well, whatever.  There's a picture of alfalfa.  Russ from Alabama.  Stupid picture.  That's terrible.  Russ from Alabama.  Hot Renee has a stinky stink knuckle.  And then he writes, you see, I linger longer.  What?  And that's a stupid picture, though, of me up there.  I don't know who took that.  Oh, yeah, Craig.  Oh, really? 
[03:12:00]  You don't know who took it.  It's obvious you're posing for it.  Yeah.  It's not like it was the paparazzi, and they got a lens on, a camera, and a bush.  I forgot who took it for two seconds.  He just started shooting at whatever he could.  And I knew they would put up a stupid picture.  I knew they would do that.  It doesn't, I'll say, it doesn't show you as nicely as it could have shown you.  I think that you look a lot better than that photograph would indicate you look.  Well, Phil from Long Island writes, lung cancer is funnier.  And Bill K. from Philly, Renee should be traded to the Canadian Comedy Channel for a bag of sand. 
[03:12:30]  Aw, thanks.  Appreciate that one.  Why?  She likes clips of guys at the Walmart, and it didn't suck.  I mean, after watching a little bit, I was like, yeah, it's all right.  All right.  It's like, no disrespect, but it's like, I probably wouldn't laugh at that if I watched it.  That's not my sensibility, but I can see a girl finding that kind of, making a sort of  geo-social political statement, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Walmart, it's accessibility to the masses. 
[03:13:00]  That's my homework.  I found something funny.  Well, you didn't say what you guys thought was funny, you said what I thought was funny,  right?  Ah, well, she turned around on us.  Yeah, no, we want to know what you find funny, and that's what you brought to us.  That was like a stupid funny.  All right, well, Dave in Philly writes, she found that clip so funny, her ass is leaking.  Oh, yeah.  You got a leaky ass because of that?  Ugh, no.  Still trying to figure out that.  Yeah, I didn't get that.  All right.  Should we have her bring in something else?  Absolutely.  This is your new bit, so you got a bit now. 
[03:13:30]  Sounds good.  Yeah.  We need another one tomorrow, but save that one for tomorrow as well.  Yeah.  We got to replay that forever.  I'd like to have a copy that to bring home in case I get sad, I throw it in.  It's a little picky up.  I thought I did my job.  Yes, you did.  Yeah.  Very good.  Okay.  So it's like a C, a B.  Oh, you want a letter grade?  I'd give a B to the C. 
[03:14:00]  I have to give it a, honestly, a D.  Okay.  I have to give it a D.  Okay.  You got to start somewhere.  It's like a C.  C, I agree.  C?  Why would you give it a C?  It's...  Because if it was only that one thing, I would have thought it sucked.  But after watching it the second time where he's like, he goes to another PA and his  stupid friend is left, like, I would...  Eh, it wasn't that bad.  It's like, it's just a kid being a douchebag in a store.  I'd never seen it before, so... 
[03:14:30]  Okay.  It's funny.  Big fat kid just singing.  Yeah, Blue Heeler from Kentucky.  That wouldn't even be funny with a smoker's laugh on it.  I'll give it a C.  A C, Greg?  Uh, A+.  Oh, that's A.  Oh, wow.  That really...  I think he has what I'm saying.  You bring the average up.  The democratization of the PA system.  That was funny.  What would you give the fetish one?  Uh, that was good.  Oh, yeah.  That's definitely...  That killed T.  A.  A.  All right.  All right.  I gotta find more...  Yeah.  I'm not gonna stick with the fetishes. 
[03:15:00]  I'm gonna go a different way, but...  Okay.  I'll find something.  Great.  Yeah.  She's like, you're working.  Not gonna stick with the fetishes.  What do you mean?  Well, I wasn't gonna...  She doesn't want to be a one-trick pony.  They stick with the same thing.  Okay.  Gotta...  Gotta pick a different route.  That's...  I'm just watching a little Maury.  He's on TV, and he's got extreme teen videos, and some guy just got cracked across the back  with a big piece of wood.  By the way, the girls on Pal Talk don't like you.  They don't like me?  Pal Talk...  French bread pizza writing, F for the hair, A cups for the chest. 
[03:15:30]  What?  Who cares?  Hey, I'm just reading them, man.  Maybe...  Oh.  The girls aren't liking you is what it comes down to.  I think that they're probably...  A little jealous?  A little threatened by Renner.  Yeah.  Maybe.  And there's nothing wrong with A cups.  No, they're fantastic.  I got nothing.  I don't care.  No, you don't want to...  Believe me, you don't want...  Don't get fake tists.  No.  Keep the A cups.  I didn't get my A's.  Yeah.  Sometimes you wish a girl would never grow up.  Uncle Paul. 
[03:16:00]  You gotta rub Earl on him.  Earl.  Earl.  Put a little Earl on Monday.  A little warmer.  They don't have to like me.  I don't care.  All right.  I think they're a little jealous of you, because you're very popular in the  studio, and everybody likes you.  Because I'm sitting here, and they're there?  That's probably it.  And every intern wants you.  Oh, that's not true.  And probably have to stand up.  That's not true.  That's not true.  The interns are all after her.  Are they really?  Oh, my God.  No, they're not.  All the guy interns in the intern party room.  Pat Duffy.  Oh, Pat Duffy.  No.  I love how you walk past that room, and she's just like, and then, and 
[03:16:30]  everyone's like, really?  Tell us more.  They're all like listening.  It's like the most interesting thing they've ever heard in their lives.  It's like Heshy and Goodfellas.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're killing every time you walk around.  Their acting is horrific, and she's just babbling away, and they're all just  like, really focused on what she has to say.  Who the hell is this?  I don't know.  How about this kid in fucking Jake LaMotta's slippers?  So, uh, who are you, sir?  I'm the new guy, Patrick.  New guy, Patrick. 
[03:17:00]  Do you like Renee?  Howdy.  Not in that way, no.  Why?  She's taller than me.  I'm kind of short.  Is that a problem?  It really narrows it down on women you can fuck with.  It does.  You're a little fella.  That's never a problem.  No.  I don't mind.  Like, you can't have a giant woman, but if a woman's, like, tall, that's  pretty cool.  I'll tell you, Renee.  5'8".  See, that's good.  That's getting up to the...  Give him a hug, and they're, like, the same size.  I've got to squat down and pick him up like a baby.  5'6", 5'7".  Aw.  5'6".  That's a cute little... 
[03:17:30]  Don't stretch it.  Don't stretch it because I'm right here.  You could just say 5'6".  It's okay.  Don't bump it up.  People are asking where they can find the picture of Renee.  It's on 92.3...  What's the website again?  It's on 92.3krock.  Yeah, 92.3krock.com.  923krock.com.  Look how she's...  Go to the Opie and Anthony page and the Opie and Anthony updates, which are great.  Look at how she's squeezing her clit by tightly crossing her legs, is what somebody's saying  on Pal Talk.  They don't like you.  Every little thing you're doing.  Bite me. 
[03:18:00]  There you go.  Bite her.  You know what?  You don't like me?  I don't give a shit.  Yeah.  I don't care.  Bite me.  Fucking Renee.  I am sitting here working my ass off, and you are there getting mad at me.  I don't care.  Wow.  Those are fighting words.  And that's the way it is.  Let's say hi to Ken and PA.  Ken, what's up?  Hey, I want to ask Renee if the world is round or flat.  World round or flat?  It's round.  All right.  She answered right away, too. 
[03:18:30]  May not belong on view, but we're good.  All right.  Very good.  All right, Renee.  Why don't you tell them that time and space is all a myth anyway?  Oh, God.  So what do you do?  Me?  Yeah.  I watch them work.  Yeah?  Run for bagels.  Have you gotten your hands into anything as far as radio-related stuff yet?  Not really.  No?  You haven't brought anything to the table yet?  No.  How long have you been here?  This is my fourth day, I believe.  Fourth day.  And you want a career in radio? 
[03:19:00]  We'll see.  This is the first time I try it.  You guys have the most committed staff, huh?  Oh, Lord.  Craig, let me explain.  A weekend, these interns realize what a waste of fucking time this is.  They're fetching, like, coffee and bagels and fruit.  And that's supposed to teach them about radio.  Yeah, I thought I was going to learn about radio.  Not learn what Opie and Anthony like to eat in the morning.  I want to know what your ultimate goal is, besides being a centerfold in Cavs Monthly.  Cavs Monthly. 
[03:19:30]  Thank you for reminding me.  My subscription's on my stuff.  Right.  My kid's got Cavs.  Jesus.  Cavs Monthly.  What are you doing in your spare time?  Just carry safes?  What are you doing in your spare time, just carry safes?  Goddamn, Jimmy.  Oh, wow.  So do you want to be on the radio?  Is that, like, your goal?  I'm just starting.  I guess production's all I'm looking for right now. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  You don't have a goal, though?  You aren't, like, you know, here's what I want to do.  I want to be on the air.  I want to do a show, or I want to produce, or...  I sort of shotgun this whole thing.  Really?  I got the internship on the...  Do the same thing to your head.  You got the intern on what?  On a dare?  On a Monday.  Okay, and then I decided to do it, and by Friday I was moved in New York.  I was doing construction up until, like, two weeks ago.  Hey, I like a guy like this.  You moved to New York for an internship?  Yeah. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, wow, are you disappointed.  What were you doing?  Do you...  Well, you go to school, obviously, right?  Yeah, I had to sign up for a college after I got the internship.  So you got an internship, and then you had to go to school, so you started going to school  after the internship.  I had to have a degree, so I had to re-enlist at a community college in Manhattan.  And what classes are you taking?  Oh, total joke classes.  Is it anything to do with broadcasting?  I took an intro to broadcasting, but I actually dumped it, because it was so terrible.  I couldn't stand the teacher.  He was late for class, and he was lying.  He was just making up...  All right. 
[03:21:00]  E-Rock.  E-Rock's teaching the class.  He's late and a liar.  Who screens these guys?  Oh, this is great.  I thought everybody wanted...  I thought these were coveted jobs.  People were dying to get radio jobs.  There's something else going on with this guy that he decided to move to New York for  an internship, even though he's out of college.  Yeah.  Who are you obsessed with on this show?  Oh, no.  No one.  It's just...  I did construction with my parents' company for three and a half years.  You just had it with that, right?  And he's retired, and he's either continue the business or just get out of it, and I 
[03:21:30]  wanted nothing to do with it, so I just...  What type of construction, my friend?  Metal stud framing, drywall.  Ah.  Bleh.  Bleh.  Bleh.  Bleh.  All day long with those fucking drills.  I wish I did that.  I was doing insulation eight hours a day.  Ah, that's good, too.  That shit makes you itch.  Hey, can I jump in fast?  Ricky Murphy from Massachusetts.  Maybe line of the day.  The world might be round, Rene, but you're flat.  Oh, wow.  Burn, yeah.  That ain't even... 
[03:22:00]  You know, there's something going on.  The listener's not enjoying Rene.  I don't care.  They're really jealous?  She doesn't care.  I don't care.  Here's from Wack Bag Entry.  Patrick's covering his heart on, is what they're saying.  They're just looking at the pictures on Pal Talk, the video, and picking you guys apart.  You've got to remember, you're always on camera in this studio.  Covering his heart on.  It was a very defensive stance you had there.  Thanks for that.  Covering your heart on.  Have you ever mastered by thinking of Rene? 
[03:22:30]  No.  Tell me the truth.  It's only the second time I get introduced to her.  Oh, really?  Maybe tonight, after everyone's yelling at her.  Spank bubble.  Hell no.  Really?  Definitely not.  You don't want him, like, doing that?  You can't stop that.  You probably are in...  I probably can't, but I'm just like...  What do you mean you probably can't?  If he wants to think about you tonight and spank it, you can't stop that.  Guys have spank Rolodexes, and let me assure you, you are in the other interns like Rolodex.  So they go through, and they, like, picture maybe, oh, you're in the hallway, and then 
[03:23:00]  you go into the green room and shut up, because they've got to be detailed, and then, like,  you lay down on the couch, and then it just progresses from there to this point where,  yeah, he's just working.  Next time, you're rolled up in insulation, being dragged into the basement.  He's trying to fit in two calves.  Calves monthly.  That's what he masturbates about, not even having sex with you, that he's just brushing  his calves over your face, and you're holding them like the giant turkey legs and worshipping 
[03:23:30]  them.  God, they're like bowling pins.  Still going to look for calves monthly on the newsstand.  He's always on his tippy toes.  He just wears knickers, even in the winter, to show them off.  Always reaching for something high up on a shelf.  Always.  Yes.  Let me get it.  Off those calves.  All right, Renee, thank you.  You're welcome.  Patrick, is it?  Patrick?  I might actually remember that now.  Sam, have you ever scrapped to Renee?  No. 
[03:24:00]  Pat Duffy, have you ever scrapped to Renee?  Pat Duffy's scrapped to everybody in this room.  Everyone.  All right, we're scrapping right now.  Have you ever scrapped to Renee vomiting or shitting on you?  Here comes Pat Duffy.  Pat.  The star of the virus tour with a video.  Hello.  What's up?  Did you ever scrap to Renee?  No.  All I have to say about Renee is that her and I had our run-ins together before this internship  started, and it wasn't worth going back to.  Wow. 
[03:24:30]  What does that mean?  She's red.  I am probably...  Am I ready?  Why run-ins?  Renee and I attended the Connecticut School of Broadcasting together.  Ah.  In the same class.  The great Connecticut School of Broadcasting.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  So what run-ins?  Negative or positive?  Positive.  So you guys maybe went out on a couple of dates?  We were seeing each other, yeah.  You were seeing each other.  Oh, okay.  How far did you guys get?  Not very far.  You were seeing Patrick Duffy.  How far?  It was before...  I'm sorry, Pac-Ahead.  No, by all means.  It was before all of this. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  Obviously.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Go ahead.  Did you guys made out?  Yeah.  Did you enjoy kissing her?  Yeah.  Did you enjoy kissing Pat?  My only complaint about Renee is that she wears way too much chapstick, so by the time  you're done making out with her, you have lip protection as well.  Exactly, yes.  I like that.  It's bullshit.  It didn't bother you, Renee?  He'd have to come by and pick you up in his Amish buggy?  Yes, indeed.  No, he never picked me up, ever.  She came to me.  Well...  Oh, God. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  Don't try to sound cocky.  She came to me.  I didn't have a vehicle.  No.  Wait, I'm sorry.  Not to...  Can I ask you...  Can I put Pat here so I can see Pat as we're talking to him?  Not to douche you, man.  I just can't see.  Basically, that means you didn't have much to offer the show.  No, no.  He was good.  But Jimmy didn't want to say that.  Pat gets...  Another Pat takes over.  I want Pat and Renee together so I can talk to him.  It's easier.  So, I didn't know that you guys dated...  So, you kissed a little bit?  A little bit.  Did you ever brush your hand, say, over his genitals or his trousers? 
[03:26:00]  No.  It didn't go far, like, to the point of any real sexuality.  No, no.  Not really.  No.  Pat?  Dry humping?  Renee, you have brushed your hand over my shorts.  Did I?  I don't even know.  Remember that night?  Exactly.  Do you remember?  Yeah.  Remember that night you came over to my house and we were together in my bed?  Yes.  There was a lot of touching that went on that day.  Whoa.  So, that was the night, by the way, that you did drive to me.  And I might as well say it now.  I had hooked up with my ex-girlfriend that same night. 
[03:26:30]  Just so you know.  Oh, okay.  Whatever.  What a fucking trooper.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold this down.  Hold on.  The same night she was in your bed, you ended up with your ex-girlfriend later on?  No.  See, my ex-girlfriend was the one that I've told you guys about, was at my house.  And then she went home because she had to get up early and I was still feeling rather randy,  if you want to use those dumb words.  So, I called Renee up and she came over from her house.  And then I finished my deed and that was it.  Wait a minute.  So, you fucked your ex?  Yes.  You dumped?  Yes.  And then Renee comes over? 
[03:27:00]  And then Renee comes over and we just kind of had like this little hookup.  It wasn't anything serious.  Did your dick come out?  No.  But I just, I really, it was really for my own personal, because I wanted to hook up  with two girls in one night.  So, I was like, I wonder if I could do this.  So, I did.  Had you gone down on your ex-girlfriend?  No, I don't think so.  I generally didn't do that too much to her.  Disgusting, huh?  Well, no.  She actually wasn't doing that.  It's that hole where a cock should be.  It was missing something, yeah. 
[03:27:30]  Now that I think about it, I'm not even mad.  You shouldn't be.  Wow.  Do you still have something for Pat?  No.  Good.  No.  Right now, I can't be bothered.  How did it break, how did the whole thing end?  Oh, can I share that?  Please.  Okay.  Well, I found out, I kind of wanted to, he kind of grew on me after a while, and I was  like, all right, I kind of like him, so I wanted to take it to the next level, and all  of a sudden, I found.  Next level means you wanted to have sex with him.  No.  Just get to know him a little more, go out, maybe a little more exclusivity.  Right, exactly.  Licking of the balloon knot. 
[03:28:00]  No.  Just trying to figure out what the next level is there.  No, no, pretty much when Anthony's talking.  Go to a mall.  Yeah.  And get a mall.  Did you want to give Duffy a two-knuckler?  Absolutely not.  No.  No.  But anyway, I found out through MySpace that he got back together with his ex-girlfriend.  And that pretty much ended then.  And that pretty much ended it.  See, if you were a fan of our show, you would have found out, too, but you didn't listen to  our show before.  Mm-hmm.  That's right.  He was discussing that on our show.  So what do you do now?  Like, are you seeing anyone?  I'm not seeing anybody.  I don't plan on seeing anybody. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, he really turned you off to guys.  No, no, not at all.  Not at all.  Hey, Pat.  He's a good kid.  Does your current girlfriend know this is, like, someone you used to be with?  Uh, no.  Oh, she does now.  Fuck.  Hey, and let's bring her in.  Oh, I'm fine.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Let's bring her in now.  It's old dog shit kisser.  You're a hit on the video on the virus tour, I gotta tell you.  Major hit.  When you kiss Pat Duffy after he brushed his teeth with dog shit, the crowd goes wild. 
[03:29:00]  Yeah.  Yes, they did.  Yeah.  He doesn't seem thrilled to be here.  Why?  I was working.  I'm all working.  Oh, well, that's, you know, Pat, of course.  Of course.  That's Renee.  They used to hook up.  Okay.  They used to, like, be kind of, uh, but nothing really happened.  It wasn't like, you don't gotta worry about, you know, if she had chlamydia.  Yeah.  That you gotta get it.  Awesome.  Although I don't think she could have chlamydia, to tell you the truth.  Yeah, basically, she's a prude, so you have nothing to worry about. 
[03:29:30]  I wouldn't call her a prude.  She's just selective.  She's a size queen and an anal queen.  I agree.  Now, did you know that one evening, uh, Pat Duffy, um...  Months ago.  Months ago.  Months.  Wait, this has nothing to do with her, because I don't want her freaking out.  No, no.  It's another ex.  Had sex with an ex-girlfriend.  Okay.  And then invited her over right after that.  I did not know.  Isn't that kind of a...  I just found out, too.  That kind of, that's kind of a, uh, tells you about his character a little. 
[03:30:00]  A little bit, yeah.  Yeah.  That's cool.  And you're fine, yeah.  As long as I'm not involved.  It wasn't you, right?  Cool.  Yeah, that's...  Whatever happened, happened.  That's what they, that's what they said about the Jews.  And then they came for this, and then they came for...  And when they, uh, came for me, no one was left to, uh...  Right.  You know what?  Something like that.  I don't pay attention to much of it.  I like the other side's speeches.  They're a pomp and circumstance.  It was a lot more fun to watch.  The other side's speeches are a lot more passionate.  Yeah.  A lot more passionate.  They're a lot more memorable. 
[03:30:30]  I think she's cuter.  Uh, who?  Thank you.  Really?  I appreciate that, Ovi.  I agree.  I, I, I find Renee a little more attractive.  Really?  Yeah.  Jimmy, it's up to you.  I'll be very honest.  They're very different types.  Facially, it's very hard to pick.  Look at her smile.  See, she's got a great smile.  Here's how you do it.  Do this.  Jimmy's making the universal mouth of the blowjob.  Oh, I thought, I thought he wanted them to sing opera.  Oh. 
[03:31:00]  You know, it's a blowjob.  It's hard to pick.  They're both very, very, uh.  That's why I said that, Renee.  It's, you know.  It's very hard to tell.  Especially if you go by taint.  But she's got bigger boobs, though.  Pat's girlfriend.  I don't need bigger boobs.  I like bigger boobs.  What are you talking about the bigger boobs?  Who cares?  Oh.  I don't have to do with that.  I mean.  Don't go to HR, please.  I'm not like that at all.  All right.  Go huffing stuff?  What the hell can he do?  Big stuffed fucker?  Probably not even flame retarded.  You can go up in a second.  Pat's girlfriend shows a little less in the sense that, not that you dress like a whore,  but you wear like a little bit of a looser clothes. 
[03:31:30]  So I can't see Pat's girl as well.  I'd certainly love to.  As you walk by, I just look at you.  The bathroom?  Oh, yes.  But I mean, it's hard to judge.  What the?  No, Pat Duffy's girlfriend, she's a trooper.  She's the real deal.  You guys get along very well.  You look like you're wearing more of a little house on the prairie kind of top.  Yeah.  I like this shirt.  You should be hanging with Laura Ingalls.  Oh, my God.  Ingalls.  Can you give me a bolt of gingham next time you swing by a gingham?  A bag of rock salt and a bolt of gingham. 
[03:32:00]  There's a lot of confusion out there.  Dave in Manhattan.  Go to the mercantile.  Pat Duffy ate dog shit but didn't eat his ex-girlfriend's pussy.  That's right.  Wait a minute.  How awful must that slit have been?  We didn't even bring that up.  She didn't really like that to be done.  Maybe you were really fucking bad at it.  I don't think so.  No?  No.  Is he bad at it?  I don't like that, to be honest with you.  Wow, you just hook up with the girls that don't like it.  You're awful at it.  Who's the common denominator?  You're awful at it. 
[03:32:30]  Here's what he does.  He fucking, instead of facing her, he goes on the side and eats the pussy from left to right.  Like corn cobs.  And he puts tape over the clip because it just bothers him to look at it.  It might be the beard getting in the way.  Yeah, there's something.  He's scratching the hell out of the ear.  There's something going on.  What are you doing?  You're fucking eating pussy wrong.  I haven't done it in a long time.  Yeah, how do you eat pussy?  I haven't done it in a long time.  In front of someone you used to date and in front of your current girlfriend.  No woman.  What's your technique?  No woman.  Well, I just haven't done it in a long time. 
[03:33:00]  I don't know.  What's your technique?  What's your technique?  I like to, um...  Oh, God.  For real.  Hey, we got a prop or anything?  Oh, prop.  Here, here's the guy.  Jimmy's asshole.  I was just going to fucking say that.  Of course you are.  That's another dick joke by Norton.  I know.  That's another dick joke by me.  And it was a Jimmy asshole joke anyway.  Oh, come on.  The toilet paper tube.  That's a big fucking...  That's if you want to practice.  That's ass game.  Make believe it's no noses face.  All right. 
[03:33:30]  He just collapsed the roll so it looks more like...  Oh, okay.  Now it's a slit.  All right.  Okay.  I like to, um...  What's a...  Hold on.  Let me get a little of this, too.  Yeah.  It's got a brand of video camera.  I got my little camera that I'm...  I'm just going to start throwing stuff up on the web.  I don't care.  All right.  Take the ledge cap.  Let's get a little...  Oh, thank you.  That might help.  I'm a professional.  All right.  I, uh...  I like to use two fingers down here in the bottom.  And then at the same time, I like to lick the clit while doing it. 
[03:34:00]  So you're just a fucking busybody on a pussy.  I guess so, yeah.  You're trying to get everything done.  And then occasionally, I'll use my lower two fingers to tickle the...  Oh, you go with the shocker.  Yeah.  I like to do that a little bit, too.  You know what you are?  You're the fucking one-man band of pussy.  He's got fucking...  He's got symbols between his legs while he's eating a box.  Like...  Ha-tha-tha-da.  Ha-tha-tha.  Harmonica mounted over here.  There's too much going on there.  Why?  It's good.  Wait, wait.  You do the two fingers and then the tongue on the clit. 
[03:34:30]  And then the tongue on the clit.  And then like this.  And then...  That's awful.  It looks like you're playing a harmonica.  That's like you got 14 fingers.  What are you doing?  You're eating pussy like someone told you to when you were 15.  Like, dude, you gotta put two in her fucking pussy and two in her ass.  Ah, there we go.  All right, we gotta blow up, dog.  Now we have a perfect example.  All right, that'll work like this you go sideways  All right, he's got two fingers in the book the blow-up doll  And you lick the clip like two in the pink one in the stink as they say 
[03:35:00]  Well, I don't know I mean like you do it do it slow you're not that you're too embarrassed with my stuff you do it that fast  She's really gonna fucking be pissed like this. It's like like that. You just I don't know you tell me you're better than I am  You're so weird that we were saying you suck at it and you said no and now we have an example here  We have a nice blow-up girl look. She thinks you suck  Now move that arm and go to it. All right. Here we go 
[03:35:30]  Here we go fingers are in there  Yeah, and then like that  But I think that uh, but you just don't like doing it  Why don't you like doing that that? I don't like doing it the girl the past three girls that I've done  Well, not three, but the girls I've been with they don't like it done. You're the problem. Why don't you have three girls?  Don't like it done once. I just wait wait wait. We're talking to his girlfriend. Why don't you like it though?  I had it done once and it was horrible. I left. Oh pat. You laughed. You could turn around 
[03:36:00]  I'd rather  Okay laughs why cuz it tickled  Uh, no cuz it's horrible. It was horrible. Well, let Pat fucking you know give it a shot  All right  Like the vagina eat some women can't come from that but nobody doesn't want to pussy if you eat pussy right no one  What about you Renee? I agree with that. Unless she was abused and it fucking creeps her out. Let's go to Rene. Rene  I'm not going there  I'm not going there 
[03:36:30]  Well, that's not a bad. Did he do that to you? No  No, she wants to be known. I think that do you like that being done?  Not a fan  You ever had it done?  Yeah, question  Good question  Why not a fan?  Cuz like she had bad experience  Oh bad experience they weren't that good?  How bad could the experience be?  Yeah, it's like saying oh god. I got the worst blowjob ever  It's like that old pizza joke. Yeah, like how bad could it really be?  Yeah, what was bad about it?  I would rather not go there 
[03:37:00]  The guy with braces and Parkinson's  No, it wasn't that. I was just  It was an uncle?  Ew  No, it was just my head  Was it a boyfriend?  It was someone that I thought I liked and he turned out to be complete asshole and this whole thing  It was just and I don't like having it done  That sounds like me  That was very vague  I know  I'm not going to  Leaving it vague  It would save a lot of effort though 
[03:37:30]  Well douche nozzle, you know, he's correct  He writes the secret to eating pussy is to channel your inner lesbian  Did he uh?  You know what the secret is?  Is not doing it like Pat Duffy  Where you feel like you gotta do something  You're fucking, you're working a flute  You're doing things, too many things  Alright  Isn't, well  And you gotta use your whole goddamn head  That's right, what do you do?  I lick the bottom of the pussy and with my nose I go  Onto the footer 
[03:38:00]  You gotta use everything  Your ears and you gotta be able to hold your breath for a long time  So wait, now hold on  I have to ask for that  I don't want to talk about it, it's fine  I'll bet that's fine  But did, was it, did he use teeth?  Cause I've heard girls say that guys have actually  Oof  Not bitten hard, but have scraped their pussy  Leave a bite like an apple  Well that's what happened to me  Oh, see  Use teeth?  Teeth?  So a guy was eating you and he used his teeth  I ate pussy like a werewolf  He probably went to suck on it, right?  Like, like 
[03:38:30]  Sucked the pussy and caught in her teeth  And fucking old clumsy teeth  Didn't know what he was doing  He thinks it's a gummy bear  Yeah  He's a fucking  Old nasty pussy biter  Alright, so you don't like it cause some guy didn't know what he was doing  He bit it  What'd the guy do wrong?  You know, without correct details  Did he do that?  I just didn't like it at all  Didn't like it?  Yeah  You might have a hang up  About that  Did he say that you smelled?  Like, I don't think 
[03:39:00]  Jesus  Fucking Jim  Jumping to some conclusions there  No, I'm not  You guys think?  Yes, dumpster pussy  You're online too  No, no, but I'm saying  Like a lot of guys don't like  That's not about you  That's a lot of guys  Just have a fucking squeamish  Of a shit like that  They don't like it  Yeah  So a guy might just smell like a great vagina  And go ugh  And fucking freak a girl  Like girls with big pussy lips  Don't like their pussies  Cause some asshole in high school  Made fun of them  Yeah  Pat Duffy, also  Now be honest  Do you dive right in there?  With your fingers in your face?  Uh  Do you like go down and go 
[03:39:30]  You know  Thwock, boom  Face is in  You mean like full throttle  Or do I work up to it?  Well I know now  You're gonna say you work up to it  Is working up to it  Working up to it?  Or are you just  Pretty much getting  Your fingers in there  And getting set  Like you're ready to bull ride?  Uh  Well yeah  I mean I guess you could put it like that  Yeah  I mean  I actually, not to sound retarded  But I actually don't really understand  The scenario you're giving me  Well I'm trying to  Like let's say  It's  You kinda gotta work up to it  Right  It's a slow process  Right 
[03:40:00]  You don't wanna start going down on a girl  With her knowing  Oh here he goes  He's pulling the old going down on me gag  Oh no, no  I don't think so  No?  No, I don't know  Sneak up on him  Yeah, you gotta sneak up on that thing  Really  He puts his fingers in so bad  Here's what the girl probably hears  He goes, okay  Are you gonna come soon?  And he  And he fucking just spits on it  And then slops his fingers again  And fucking jams them in  Fucking fingernails  Scraping the inside  Oh god 
[03:40:30]  He's fucking  I'm pretty good with my fingers  Well clipped fingernails  I gave you your first orgasm  Yes  Wow  Cool, hold on  Fucking Danny Discreet  Really  Maybe she didn't want the whole world to know that  No, that's cool  Alright  Hey Stacy's got a shocker story  Stacy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I got a pretty interesting shocker story for you guys  My gynecologist from home would give me the shocker as a normal test  Uh huh  What?  Like, I've never had any other OBGYN do it 
[03:41:00]  But two in the pink, one in the stink, right in every annual exam  Two in the pink, one in the stink  Wow  Was it the thumb that was one of them?  No, no, no  Nope  No?  In the middle  Cause that doesn't even make sense  That doesn't make sense  So I thought maybe they were trying to feel something in there  I know, that's what I said  I know, that's what I said  She said that was extraordinary  Dr. Champ to surgery  Dr. Champ  The gynecologist had to pray before she went to home  Two in the baby hole, one in the baby hole 
[03:41:30]  Greats are all no  So wait, sweetheart  He would do this  Would you cum?  No, no  And it was a 76 year old woman  To boot  Wow  Ew  Fucking charm bracelet with her grandchildren's hands  Maybe that was just her hand was like arthritically formed that way  She wasn't really  Her charm bracelet's jingling against the speculum  Did she have a speculum in you while she did this?  That would be a fucking talent and a half 
[03:42:00]  That is  Did she explain why she did that?  She never really said anything more than it's just a normal procedure  But because of her age  At her house  What old practice taught you that you should give women the shocker?  Like what in schooling said  Now when you're testing for pressure and here, here, and here  You need to make sure that you have two in the pink and one in the sink  And yada, yada, yada  Cause there was so much dysentery back then 
[03:42:30]  You never knew when anyone was just gonna drop a giant load on the table  So you wanted to make sure to stuff that up  Yeah, she's that old  I mean she probably  Yeah  Goddamn  Alright, Stacy  I have to examine your asshole  Smoke this cigarette  It's good for you  Excellent  Alright, thanks guys  Remember gynecology class  One in the stink, two in the pink  I love that you kept going back to this doctor though over and over  Yeah, after the first time  A lot of people doing their Larry King impressions on instant feedback 
[03:43:00]  Really?  How important is the clit to pussy eating?  Pussy eating  Pat Duffy  You ever done any pussy eating?

If Pat was to be fired soon  No, that's cool  Trying to get hired  That's because you like something  That's probably why that you need a little bit of work on the vag eating  Because you do it like as just a way to do something else instead of loving it  Can you eat her vag tonight and then we'll have a full report tomorrow?  Yeah, I could definitely do that  Would you mind?

You know, when you're talking about a girl with no gag reflex  It's hard for me to wanna go  Ha ha ha, here's my zinger  And when you caught me with my hand in my lap  I wasn't doing anything  I was just, I kinda  I think you went for a squeeze, didn't you?  You were ready to squeeze  I fucking gave about six squeezes  And then you noticed  I'm like, I'm just resting  I just know Jimmy too well  She was talking about no gag reflex  I didn't mean it to be disrespectful  It's like you don't think  It's just natural 
[03:52:30]  You can't help yourself  Oh, you got it?  Yeah  E-Rock  Virgin  Line of the day is brought to you by  BodogFantasy.net  Play against our own Travis  In a weekly pick'em league  And win four grand  It's free  To open an account on BodogFantasy.net  And pick the weekly winners  Here's a runner-up line of the day  So it's like a C, a B  Oh, you want a letter grade?

With an I  Daughter of the guy with the nice smile and rotted asshole  That's actually his fucking confirmation name  Here's another little  Well, runner-up line of the day  For the top of his head  No one makes it  So it makes it harder to get your balls into the top of his head  Because his hands are moving back and forth over the top  Only a few people will get this but screw it 
[03:54:00]  Yeah  He moves his hands over his head  Like Earl does when Earl's trying to think  Oh, when Earl's thinking  Say  A Mr. Bucket  Eh  Eh  Not really  What was that?  Where was the joke?  Oh, the Earl thing?  Yeah, but I stammered through the whole thing  Oh, it was kind of a  Mr. Bucket  That's right  Mr. Bucket  Push the balls in my top  Mr. Bucket  Out of my mouth they will pop  Mr. Bucket 
[03:54:30]  We're all gonna run  Mr. Bucket  The game's Mr. Bucket  The first to get their balls into Mr. Bucket wins  But look out...  Cause the balls will pop out of his mouth  Mr. Bucket  The balls will pop out of my mouth  Mr. Bucket  Our ball is what I'm about  Mr. Bucket  We're all gonna run  Ms. Bucket  Mr. Bucket  From Milton Bradley  Alright  Now that we're not on terrestrial radio, what I want to do with Mr. Bucket is I want  to put my cock right in his fucking bucket nose mouth and drop warm liver into him so 
[03:55:00]  it fucking shoots like warm liver all over my fucking mouth.  All over your cock.  His Mr. Bucket throat.  Your balls come out of his mouth.  And as I'm fucking Mr. Bucket, if the parents walk in, I'll give him that fucking Mr. Roper  smile.  We used to just turn around and make that dopey smile.  They'd like stay on him for a while.  Where are we at?  One more runner up.  All right.  Pitching out all of your cock. 
[03:55:30]  Mr. Bucket.  Another runner up line of the day.  You know, he would do like self-depreciating black guy jokes and you know how people love  that.  Oh, yeah.  Later, he would rape them.  That was hilarious.  When Ron said that they went to see fucking Brian Regan, they just bought a covered dish.  Covered dish.  Why did we even bother doing the first three hours of radio?  Nothing funny from the first three, huh? 
[03:56:00]  Lots of stuff.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Ankle bracelet, you're saying, E-Rock?  That would never be an option for you if you committed a crime.  You know that, right?  You have to cut it off with a hacksaw.  You can't get to the latch.  Thank God.  We just put this thing on and we got to get a larger one. 
[03:56:30]  His leg would grow over it like when a tree eats a sign on the side of the road.  Oosh.  Oosh, indeed.  Wow.  They are following the E-Rock formula for the line of the day.  Yes.  Make fun of the E-Rock.  You get line of the day.  You instantly get line of the day.  Stone Cold Steve Austin on the show tomorrow?  I think so, yeah.  All right.  And also Otto and George and Voss.  And Voss.  Stone Cold Steve Austin.  There's probably a couple of people very excited about tomorrow's show. 
[03:57:00]  I would think E-Rock.  Very excited.  I would think Sam.  Very excited.  Is he bringing in the belt?  Is Stone Cold a hero of yours?  No.  Someone you look up to?  Someone you admired?  Did you know his hero list?  He ain't on it.  It's Dad and Opie.  Hulk Hogan.  And Hulk Hogan.  Honestly, answer correctly.  Did you ever get choked up listening to that song Hulkster in Heaven?  No.  You know the song? 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  I sent it to them.  You what?  When they played it, I sent it to them.  Why?  Because I had it.  You thought it was nice?  What do you like about Hulk Hogan?  That he's one of your heroes?  I used to like him when he was wrestling.  Explain why.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Why does anybody like him?  He was exciting to watch.  Excited?  So he made you excited?  Why did he make you excited?  Tell us. 
[03:58:00]  I don't.  I just did.  What was your fantasy with Hulk?  That he would be your friend or pick you up and take you to the mall?  What did you want with Hulk?  No.  Don't you even come in there.  You wanted to be a little Hulkster?  Were you a Hulkamaniac?  I was.  Did you wear the Hulk outfit?  No.  Because my dad hated wrestling and refused to buy me anything.  Yeah.  You know what that was about, right?  He thought you were gay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little fruity son with a bunch of shirtless man posters. 
[03:58:30]  Fucking laying there with a tent in your little fat boy pants.  Watching Hulk Hogan with his fucking blonde mullet.  Did you go to the wrestling shows and see Hulk rip his shirt off?  No.  And then it would happen with you, but just after lunch?  What did the Hulk preach?  Yeah.  To train, say your prayers, and eat your vitamins.  Yeah.  Why didn't you listen? 
[03:59:00]  Hey, the fat thing is only recent.  I never was like it.  It's only recent.  That's a sound clip.  He defends himself.  If I say it, the fat thing is only recent.  Relatively speaking, recent?  Like, you know, Vietnam?  How is Hulk a hero?  What did he give him a hero?  That's a big statement.  Yeah.  You put that as an adult.  You didn't put that as a child.  It was fucking, it was your dad.  It was Opie.  It was fucking Hulk Hogan.  Did you wish he would give you the leg drop?  No. 
[03:59:30]  No.  The leg drop.  Oh, growing up in the 80s, you watched wrestling.  You liked Hulk Hogan.  Did you?  I grew up in the 80s.  I watched wrestling.  Yeah, but you're a little older than me.  I preferred Bob Backlund.  Oh, he just bashed you, Jimmy.  I liked Ivan Kutzti.  Called you old.  The Polish Hammer.  Yes.  And?  Who'd you like?  Chief?  Chief J?  No, I was pretty much a fan of, I have no fucking idea.  I really didn't care about wrestling in the 80s.  I didn't care about wrestling until we were on the radio. 
[04:00:00]  And it was worth our while to give a shit about wrestling.  Yeah, we had to make believe.  I remember that too.  But then I kind of got into it like a soap opera, you know?  You kind of watch a few episodes and go, hey, what's going on there?  I was a big fan of Andre the Giant.  Yeah, he was the one.  There you go.  Andre.  Do you know what I named my cock after a midget wrestler?  I swear to God, Coconut Willie.  You call your cock Coconut Willie?  I was a kid I did, yeah.  I just named my penis Coconut Willie because I saw a little man named Coconut Willie. 
[04:00:30]  And I just thought that that should be what your genitals are called.  It's pretty good.  It's not bad.  Sam?  Excited about Stone Cold coming in?  Extremely excited, yeah.  D-Rock threw the mic at him.  I mean, he's not my hero or anything, but yeah, I'm pretty pumped.  Now, are you bringing in the belt?  No.  Why?  Because I figured once I got the belt out of here in one piece...  You were lucky.  ...that I would not press my luck again.  You know what I would do with the belt?  What's that?  I would have every wrestler sign the back of it. 
[04:01:00]  See, I was thinking about that, but technically Stone Cold didn't hold that belt.  It doesn't matter.  It's like, I think if you kept going for years and got wrestlers to sign that belt, it would  be worth so much money after they die.  Think 20 years from now.  If you have wrestlers that are wrestling now...  I have a steel chair for like two and a half years.  I've been getting wrestlers to sign.  Do you lug a chair around, huh? 
[04:01:30]  Oh, is that someone signing your chair?  Yeah, it's Stone Cold.  Oh, it is Stone Cold.  Yes, it is.  I'd like to get really wet clothes and then just sit on that chair.  Just windex it once.  It's gone.  Bill from Waterford.  E-Rock probably used to try to rip his own shirt off, but he was too lazy and fat-bodied  to do so.  Oh, he'd like go, and he'd tear it and then fatly fall through a glass table.  When would you give up?  When would you give up on trying to rip your own shirt off? 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, George the Animal Steel, sure.  He'd in the turnbuckle.  They should have kicked him out of the league for that.  Yeah.  There's no reason for that.  Why don't we do a little Iron Sheik, because that's Ant's favorite.  Iron Sheik as we say goodbye today.  Iron Sheik.  Great, Geraldo, a pleasure, man.  Thanks, Bill.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for popping in short.  I learned a lot about eating pussy a little time.  Eating some pussy, yeah.  Remember that.  Pussy good.  Yeah.  This hole smells like mushroom. 
[04:02:30]  I got to find that doctor that does the shocker.  Yeah.  See if they'll help you out, right?  I got a doctor for you.  I went in for strep throat, and he stuck a finger on my ass.  Nice.  Yeah.  Not once, but twice.  Did it work?  Checking the hard way.  Wow.  And, of course, the lovely girls at Pal Talk.  When is Miss Pal Talk?  Tomorrow.  $500.  Tomorrow.  $500 up for grabs.  Yep.  Miss Pal Talk.  Anything goes.  I see a winner up on the screen right now.  The cute, sweet Jody. 
[04:03:00]  Where's Jody?  Isn't she adorable?  Where's Jody?  Look, she's not shaking her head now.  She gets so embarrassed.  Why is Jody embarrassed?  She's got such lovely red hair.  I can't.  Ant likes very...  Ant prefers a younger looking gal.  I just...  I think she's very cute.  She was at FH?  I don't like old ragged whores.  I'm not saying...  Listen, hold on.  She was at FH.  Yeah, I met her at FH.  Colonel from Boogie Nights.  I'm not saying you do.  Colonel.  I don't do anything with him. 
[04:03:30]  He's just so cute.  Oh, that's hysterical.  Colonel from Boogie Nights.  Do you just pick him up and hold him?  Say you're my friend, Opie.  Opie, say you're my friend.  Oh, is that bad?  All right, who's going to win Miss Paltop?  Who's the favorite?  A lot of people saying Baby Girl.  Who's going to win tomorrow?  Yeah, a lot of people saying Marissa.  But now that the angle's been thrown in where it's also kind of a talent competition...  Red rum.  You got to pick red rum.  You got to...  I don't know. 
[04:04:00]  It's all up for grabs at this point.  Do we just go with sheer looks or do we go with talent competition?  Yeah.  We'll find out tomorrow.  There's your big piece for today.  Opie's like, I'm not doing shit.  Don't worry.  Yeah, just blow dry your hair and put some makeup on tomorrow.  You'll be fine.  You already did something.  You pulled your hair back in that ponytail.  She had to get up and bend over and pull it into a ponytail.  I think pigtails will win tomorrow.  Pigtails might garner a favor with me. 
[04:04:30]  Pigtails with a baseball bat up your ass.  I think...  Not a baseball.  What?  A lisp and an altered birth certificate.  Yeah.  That'll get you right to the top tomorrow.  Or be funny.  Like, have like a half a log sticking out of your ass and just spin in a circle.  Wait, what's the half a log that goes back in called again?  Oh, the old...  Oh, wait.  Dipsy doodle?  The old dipsy doodle.  The old dipsy doodle.  Like, when a girl's on her stomach and she kind of starts to shit and the log pokes it  like a soldier of a tank, that's the old dipsy doodle. 
[04:05:00]  The old dipsy doodle.  Or the old looky-loo.  The old looky-loo.  It takes a little look around.  Yeah, the old peek-a-boo.  Soldier coming out of a foxhole for a second.  Yeah, just taking a peek around.  He swims out of the cave, goes back into the cave.  Uh, shit me a sheep shank.  The dipsy doodle.  The old dipsy doodle.  The old dipsy doodle.  But the difference, Greg, and Greg has to know, the difference is like when you're on 
[04:05:30]  your stomach, the shit pokes out, that's like the old peek-a-boo.  That's just the little one, yeah.  The dipsy doodle is when she's squatting and she lets a piece come out and like she sucks  it back up and it kind of curls and swipes the side of the neck.  Yeah, it swings a little, yeah.  It gets a little wild like a monkey tail.  That's disgusting.  Oh, monkey tail.  I'm trying to think of which one is hotter.  I don't know.  It depends on what I'm in.  I can get a tomato tomorrow.  Everyone's got their own take on it.  Wow.  Wow.  That is just brutal. 
[04:06:00]  And someone's got to tell Oscar De La Hoya he can't be in the Miss Pal Talk contest  tomorrow.  How fucking embarrassing for Oscar McQua.  God damn.  Yeah, you don't want to be wearing a fishnet outfit and ladies' panties.  When your job is to fucking hit Pete, he's a tough guy.  Beat the shit out of people.  He should just wear that in the ring the next time.  Hey.  Painted nails.  Fluster the opposition.  Hey, what gets cut from the replay now that we went late?  I don't know.  I've got to ask Danny.  Well, let's not do it all willy-nilly. 
[04:06:30]  Let's fucking...  I say the interview we did.  Okay.  It's an easy choice today.  Easy choice today, if you know what I mean.  Okay.  Let's do that.
