<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts playfully bickering about a recurring "stupid noise" in the studio and the arrival of Friday.  They then transitioned to a discussion of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, focusing on the Celtics' upset victory over the Heat and making crude, offensive jokes about Chris Bosh's appearance, even referencing a news story about a masseuse's death at Bosh's house.  The conversation shifted to the Scott Walker recall election in Wisconsin,  commenting on the Democrats' anger and the perceived apathy among Obama's 2008 supporters, attributing it to the diminished novelty of electing the first Black president.  They found humor in a video showing a woman slapping Scott Walker's opponent, Mayor Barrett ("Goldie Wilson").  A lengthy segment followed, showcasing a video of a distraught Walker opponent supporter declaring the election "the end of democracy," which the hosts repeatedly played for comedic effect.  This led to reminiscing about childhood experiences: taping songs from the radio, Saturday morning cartoons (Bugs Bunny, The Flintstones, Mighty Mouse),  and the challenges of pre-internet information access.  They also discussed obsolete technologies like portable TVs, Discmen, and 8-track tapes, contrasting them with modern ease of access to information and entertainment.  The segment concluded with speculation on future technology like Google Glasses and advanced contact lenses, a brief mention of a friend's birthday, and several musical acts.

The show continued with humorous speculation about whether deceased relatives could witness their loved ones' embarrassing private thoughts and actions.  This transitioned into memories of drive-in movie theaters, including anecdotes about their childhood experiences and the technology of the drive-in speakers.  They discussed the defunct Comac Theater/Motor Inn and looked at old drive-in movie advertisements, mentioning films like *Safe House*, *Inside Man*, and *American Gangster*, leading to a discussion of their DVD and Blu-ray collections and the shift to streaming services.  The conversation included the legal battles surrounding 2 Live Crew's music, the death of rapper Rocko,  the controversy over Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby" and its similarity to "Under Pressure," and other one-hit wonders like Young MC and MC Hammer.  A DJ, Troy Kwan, who created a longer version of a song based on their studio noises, was mentioned. A bit from comedian Joe DeRosa about oral sex was played.  Tom Papa joined as a guest, discussing his sister's charity and reminiscing about COD transactions, the Columbia House record club, and childhood schemes involving free goods and toll booth avoidance.  Colin Hanks was also mentioned as a future guest.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls detailing various scams and schemes.  This included using magnets to remove security tags, toll-road evasion, Home Depot return schemes, self-checkout exploitation, creating fake license plates, reselling stolen movie cups, manipulating gas station oil dipsticks, a multi-million dollar 900-number phone scam, an IRS scam using undervalued coins, a lottery ticket scam, a story about aggressive Christmas light sales, a Red Lobster gift card scam, and shoplifting with children at Macy's. The "Chuck E. Cheese token scam" was also briefly discussed. Tom Papa remained a guest in the studio during this segment.

The final segment featured a discussion of the movie *Prometheus*, with Colin Hanks (in studio) expressing strong opinions, using profanity, alongside the hosts.  Hanks discussed his new movie, *High School*, detailing its plot and his role, along with anecdotes from filming and promotion, including a story about promoting it with Adrian Brody and Michael Chiklis.  Other topics included a listener's story about bypassing airport security with a concealed weapon, the aging process of actors (Tom Skerritt and Richard Dreyfuss), rom-com movie poster design, and Hanks' experiences with celebrities, including declining a meeting with Cher.  His father, Tom Hanks, was also mentioned.  The show concluded with promotions for *High School*, Tom Papa's stand-up show, and upcoming Opie and Anthony live events.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Put on up of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  The stupid noise thing again.  Bah, bah, bah, bah. Wow.  So dumb, man.  Morning, everyone.  Good morning.  How are we this fine morning?  I was trying to trick that guy into saying it was Friday. 
[00:00:30]  I go, Friday morning.  Oh, he didn't like it.  He goes, working toward it.  Working toward it.  Working toward it.  Ain't going to fool me.  Ain't going to fool me.  That's my bit with the guy.  Just Friday morning.  Working toward it.  Trip him up.  Yeah, trip him up a little bit.  He might fall for it on a Thursday.  You know how he talks sports in the morning?  Yeah.  They were going at it like crazy for like 10 minutes or whatever.  So I went to get some coffee.  And as I come back, I guess they were wrapping up.  And he just said, NBA, NBA, NBA.  NBA.  He loves the NBA.  He was bitching because he was trying to like get a bigger bet in with somebody around here. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  And he's mad that the guy didn't go for the extra five bucks or something.  I don't know.  I don't know if he had like a little side side.  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't say that.  I get the impression that he likes to put a little action on the game.  Papa needs a new pair of shoes.  Papa needs a new pair of shoes.  Snake eyes.  Fucking Celtics.  I know you're not following this, Ant, but they beat the Heat at home.  Yeah.  The old black Celtics.  Right.  Beat the Heat at home.  And now it's three games to two going back to Boston. 
[00:01:30]  This series is crazy.  I know.  Because the Heat is supposed to be like the team.  Yeah.  The Heat were supposed to destroy them.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, they beat them last year in five games.  And now it's 3-2 Boston going back to Boston.  Boston.  They got a real good shot of knocking the Heat out.  Yeah.  And the dinosaur came back yesterday.  Chris Bosh.  Why do they call him that?  You don't know the Chris Bosh thing?  No.  He looks like a dinosaur.  He looks like a turtle.  Oh. 
[00:02:00]  He looks like one of the Avatar people.  You don't know this about Chris Bosh.  Oh, Jesus.  In the sports world, man.  I mean, people obsess about this guy.  How awful he is looking.  That's racist.  I read a tweet last night where someone goes, could he at least play with a bag over his  head?  He's too disturbing to watch?  It's not that he's disturbing.  He looks like monsters.  He looks like dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs.  And he really looks like an Avatar guy without, you know, you don't even need the makeup. 
[00:02:30]  You could throw him right in the fucking movie.  Yeah.  You don't know about this.  No.  It's a phenomenon in the sports world.  No, I haven't heard about it.  They obsess about Chris Bosh.  There's a little side story about Chris Bosh for the sports people out there.  A masseuse died at his house a couple days ago.  What?  Yeah.  And there he is playing basketball last night.  Whoa.  Coming back from an injury.  What happened?  My worst nightmare, by the way.  What you just said.  Oh, really?  God, yes.  Really?  I think she was in her 40s.  I think she survived cancer a year ago. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, boy.  Came over for a massage.  And by 1 o'clock, they were calling the medics.  1.30, something like that.  She got there at 10.30.  10.40.  Oh, man.  I didn't read the whole article yet.  But, yeah, there was a situation at Chris Bosh's house.  A situation.  Oh.  Yeah.  All on the up and up.  There was no hanky-panky.  No shenanigans.  But the lady did drop at his house.  She was all legit.  Yep.  Another great game for the Celtics.  Holy shit.  As far as basketball goes, this is a pretty good series, Ant. 
[00:03:30]  Pretty good series.  Yeah.  I just never was able to dive into that whole basketball thing.  I understand.  Yeah.  But our guy, I think he definitely loves the NBA.  And I think he might have a little action.  A little action on it.  Just a little action.  Yes.  Ah.  Oh.  So, Walker won.  I don't even know what this means.  I swear to you, I don't know.  The recall election.  I've heard the name Scott Walker off and on for the last, what? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Five months or so.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Six months.  Yeah.  But he won.  Was he supposed to win?  Is it a big deal in the end?  Yeah.  I guess, you know.  What happened?  Why was there a re-election?  A recall election.  Recall, recall election.  I recall.  They wanted to oust him.  Yeah.  So, I guess you're able to get a petition together.  And if you get enough signatures, they will have a recall election.  Yeah.  And try to toss him out.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Well, it didn't work.  He won.  And he's still in there.  Are the Democrats pissed?  The Democrats are very angry.  Very angry.  So, MSNBC is going to be very angry today.  Yeah.  It'll be their turn to be angry today?  Their turn to be angry.  Okay.  Wisconsin's considered kind of, you know, a swing state.  It's kind of a, they're saying a little mandate on Obama and his upcoming election.  The fact that the Republicans won.  Um, and, uh, yeah, the Democrats very angry at this whole thing and just spinning, spinning, 
[00:05:00]  spinning, um, on various news shows how, uh, this does not reflect Obama, does not reflect  the upcoming presidential election, but I guess if the Democrat won, they'd be like,  well, this proves that Obama really does have it handily, uh, and it will, yeah, it  just, it's, they're all a bunch of phonies.  The only reason I bring it up, there's two things, uh, to look out for today because 
[00:05:30]  people are just waking up.  I think we're just ahead of people.  I like that.  Just ahead of the curve.  Just ahead.  Crest of the wave.  You're going to see, uh, a lady, um, slapping, what's his name there?  Yeah, uh, the other guy.  I don't even know the other guy's name.  It's the other guy.  The other guy that ran, uh, against Scott Walker.  Was it Goldie Wilson?  Goldie Wilson.  There you go.  Let's just say it was Goldie Wilson.  And she slaps him nice and hard because what, she was pissed that he conceded?  Yes.  Very angry. 
[00:06:00]  She was saying, look, people are still voting.  Why are you conceding?  This is not cool.  Yeah.  So she, he's in the crowd kind of after he conceded, he went in the crowd to shake hands  with his supporters and this woman just smacked him in the face.  Really hard.  Did you video it?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  They're playing it on a loop.  Who'd she slap?  Uh, uh, uh, Goldie Wilson.  Goldie Wilson.  We're going to call him Goldie Wilson because it doesn't matter anymore, especially because  he lost.  What is the Walker thing, dude?  Goldie Wilson.  I missed what's going on.  Like, I, I, I saw it this morning on Drudge at my house and I-  Mayor Barrett. 
[00:06:30]  Mayor Barrett?  Yeah.  It was just a recall election that, um, I guess was a big deal for-  I like Goldie Wilson better.  People that are in that world and-  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, it, it, it, it was very important to a lot of people in Wisconsin.  Uh, it's also, was supposed to be some kind of a, kind of a little look inside what might  happen in November.  Right.  As far as some of these states go.  And I, I really do think that, uh, the Democrats shouldn't be, uh, shouldn't be counting their 
[00:07:00]  chickens as they say.  Mm-hmm.  Cause it's kinda, as I keep saying, I don't see this outpouring of voters that got Obama  in.  It wasn't just people that wanted a president elected and a Democratic president elected.  People voted for Obama cause they wanted a black president.  There are people that just voted for Obama because he was black.  And you think a lot of those people are not going to vote again?  A lot of those people are not going to vote again.  A good percentage, right? 
[00:07:30]  Cause it already happened.  It already happened.  And it's like, oh wow, we, they actually saw and said, wow, there is a really good chance  to have the first black president of the United States.  And, and it was very exciting.  And everybody got all, uh, uh, riled up and, and, and registered to vote and got out and  voted.  There was a huge, uh, young voter turnout because of it.  Um, and I don't see that same votership going out there and voting.  I just don't see the passion.  I don't think he did enough for those same people to come out and, uh, vote again. 
[00:08:00]  That's true.  If he got a lot done, then I think you would see a lot, you know, those same people, you,  you know, coming out again.  I don't think the same people, I think you'd see a lot of his supporters, but I think there's  specifically people that went out and voted because he was black and because it would  be the first black president.  When you think those people would want him to continue as the first black president?  No, it's like, they don't care anymore.  Think of the viewership on like Apollo 11 first, uh, uh, ship to the moon. 
[00:08:30]  Right.  It was huge.  It was huge, huge.  Uh, and then as the missions went on and on, it just, it was a huge drop off.  People love firsts.  They love to be involved with the first thing.  And then after it, they lose interest to the point where I think by Apollo, uh, by Apollo  17, people were bitching that, uh, like I love Lucy wasn't on reruns.  So, you know, it just, uh, yeah, the novelty's over.  Thank you, Mr. Booger couch. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  That's the way to put it.  Yeah.  The novelty's over.  We all like us.  And what you said also, the fact that he didn't do enough for the, for his base, his real,  his real core.  To get those same people out to vote.  To get the same people out to vote, along with the fact that it was a novelty and stuff.  I, I don't think they should be looking at it like, oh, this is just, we got this hands  down.  I'm not saying he's, he's definitely going to lose.  It's going to be a close election.  It's going to be a very close election.  Really close, you think?  I think really close.  Because.  Within a couple votes?  I think two votes. 
[00:09:30]  Two votes?  Because I think on the other hand, you have the Republicans that are really wound up and will  come out in numbers because they really do not like Obama and don't want him in office  anymore.  Yeah.  So, with those two things working, you might see, if I may quote a famous musician, you  might see the pendulum swinging back the other way.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Why?  Do you think that Ronnie's saying that Obama best get out of his way? 
[00:10:00]  Obama best get out of my way.  Let's get back to Scott Walker.  So, you got a guy.  Oh, this guy's great.  This guy's classic.  This is the other thing I wanted to mention about the Scott Walker thing.  Guy who voted against Scott Walker says, this is the end of democracy.  End of democracy.  Guy loses his mind.  And this is a prime example of somebody who's so caught up in this personally and emotionally  that he honestly thinks, because things did not go his way, that it is absolutely the  wrong way. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  People really are of that mindset these days, that if things don't go their way, it's not  the proper or correct way, and it's doom and gloom, and everything's over, Johnny.  But you're not surprised.  I'm not surprised.  Okay, that's the way of the world.  I think everyone, not everyone, but a majority of people think this.  There are many times I think that way, too.  I think every single person listening probably thinks that at times.  But, uh, I have a radio show.  It's my job.  It's my job to bitch, yell, and complain. 
[00:11:00]  What's your job?  This guy just went in front of a microphone and lost his fucking mind.  It's great.  I watched the link.  Really annoying guy.  Oh, it's great.  We're waiting to hear from the big winner tonight, Republican Governor Scott Walker.  As we do, Ted Rowland was drowned out by those disappointed demonstrators just moments ago.  But just before we brought Ted on, he interviewed a voter who underscored his disappointment tonight.  Let's listen.  Mike volunteered for Barrett, voted today.  You say you're very disappointed.  A lot of folks here outside the Capitol sharing your opinion tonight. 
[00:11:30]  We're not just disappointed.  This is the end of democracy.  We just got outspent $34 million to $4 million.  This was the biggest election in America, and I hope you keep me on tonight, because this  hurts us all.  Every single one of you out there in the nation, if you're watching, democracy died tonight.  I'm very emotional.  I'm very emotional, because we all had a lot invested in this.  This was it.  If we didn't win tonight, the end of the USA as we know it just happened. 
[00:12:00]  That's it.  We just got outspent $34 million to $4 million.  And we don't have any other resource left but the people you see here behind me.  And if the people you see here behind me can't get it done tonight, it's done.  Democracy's dead.  Emotional testimony, their reaction from that people.  The best moment was right after he said you're very emotional.  He said something.  Ah!  It's still real to me.  Yeah, it's still real.  I like this one. 
[00:12:30]  Somebody just wrote, I came to this election with two bad knees.  Yeah.  And a dream.  18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  With two very bad knees.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  And a dream to become a major league baseball player.  Oh, I sure hope it happened.  He seems like a nice man.  Does he?  Mm-hmm.  Did it work out?  Hope so.  I beg God, the dream came true.  Oh, it did come true.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  That's good news. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, my God.  That guy.  I can't get enough to cry.  Is there a video of that?  I've never seen the video.  Oh, yeah.  We've shown the video.  I've never fucking seen Mike Schmidt crying.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's out there.  That guy is so fucking caught up in it.  And democracy died.  It was a legitimate election.  It was actual democracy.  At work, wasn't it?  One side got more votes than the other side, and they won.  I guess the fact that the other side spent so much more money, maybe that's what he's 
[00:13:30]  talking about as far as democracy losing.  Yeah, but fucking Obama outspent McCain like two to one last presidential election.  Boy, did he.  And he won.  I mean, it's all about money, and it's not just a Republican thing.  Democracy ain't dead.  Money, money, money.  Look what Bloomberg outspent.  Bloomberg?  Crazy.  Everybody in history, I think, he outspent.  Yeah.  Good old Bloomberg.  I love how we're trying to, like, rationalize why this guy is fucking loony.  He's just fucking crazy. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  That happens.  What are you going to do?  I hope Tommy Lasorda's doing all right.  Oh, yeah.  Had a little heart attack there.  A little heart attack.  He's 84 years old.  Holy shit.  Oh, man.  By the way, I'm watching the Schmidt video as we talk.  He's still crying.  I didn't realize.  He walked away from the mic.  Why all the dislikes on this video?  It's terrific.  It's phenomenal.  Dude, he's fucking just.  They're playing.  This is why. 
[00:14:30]  He's crying.  They're playing crying.  All right.  That's very funny.  With two very bad knees.  Very bad knees.  Very bad knees.  Any other chorus?  In a dream to become a major league baseball player.  What can I do?  I think it came true. 
[00:15:00]  Wow, he's really crying.  Seven years had to walk away.  And then he walks away from the mic.  I guess I've never seen this.  I thought I did.  I've seen a shorter version of the clip.  Then he's just leaning up against the back wall trying to get himself together. 
[00:15:30]  Mike Schmidt's just bawling in this.  They keep looping the video.  There shouldn't be that much red on this video.  No, no.  That's pretty good, man.  I guess those are the sports fans that don't find this funny.  Poor Mike.  Did he play for 17 years?  Probably. 
[00:16:00]  Is that how long?  Sounds about right.  What year is this?  93?  Oh, God.  Or 91?  No, it's 2012, silly.  Oh, I didn't mean right now, Mr. Fresh Pants.  I meant when the Mike Schmidt video was filmed.  When did Shemini retire?  Was it before the 90s?  93?  I don't know.  I'm just going to throw a year out there.  It could be 69 for what I really don't know.  I'm going to go early 90s.  Just make it up.  I'm going to say 92.  I said 93.  89?  89.  I'm going to say 89.  He might have retired in 89. 
[00:16:30]  No, wait.  No, 89.  Oh, dang.  The lies have to stop, Dan.  I'm going to say...  He made it to the 90s, didn't he?  Maybe the...  I'm going to say 91.  I'm going to say 92.  No, he left Dayton, Ohio, by the way, with a couple of enemies.  It's a pretty amazing story.  89?  May 28, 1989.  Against the San Francisco.  He hasn't played a baseball game in 23 years?  Wow.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  That's nuts. 
[00:17:00]  Dry your eyes.  Dry your eyes.  He did.  Quit playing baseball.  I guess the story is going to be all right.  Mild heart attack.  84, though.  Wow, 84.  Boy.  And he doesn't take care of himself.  He did for a little while, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He was doing the commercial.  What dumb commercial did he do where he lost a few pounds?  The one with the shake, wasn't it?  Yeah, he was one of the shake guys.  He was one of the shake...  I would imagine he's not still drinking shakes.  Slim fast.  As soon as that check stopped coming to his house, he was done with the dumb shakes.  Done with them.  And back to the snakes and the potatoes. 
[00:17:30]  He was good.  Just synonymous with the Dodgers.  You know who's fucking killing it this year is Mattingly.  Mattingly's the new good boy for the Dodgers, eh?  And they're the best team in baseball.  In baseball.  In baseball.  Yeah, Mattingly is the coach of the fucking Dodgers.  Good for him.  Donnie baseball.  And I believe they have the best record right now.  Dude, I can't believe he's been gone.  I was at his last game.  I can't...  At least I was in Yankee Stadium.  It was late 90s, right?  95.  Holy fuck.  Dude, 90 fucking five was the last time he played in the stadium.  What's creepy is it looks like he can still play. 
[00:18:00]  He's not really aging.  He looks healthy at least.  Yeah, he's looking all right.  Remember he got a $20 million deal.  It was 19.5 and Steinbrenner said because he would never pay $20 million for a baseball player.  Like that was...  It was like over five years or whatever.  But he got like a 19-something million dollar contract.  And back then that was...  And now it's a year's pay for fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  Do you want to address this, Ant?  People are saying you're working for Fox.  Man!  Of course I do.  I've been saying that for years.  He does. 
[00:18:30]  Of course I do.  Well, I do go on Fox.  He doesn't hide it.  No, I'm a Republican.  So, you know, I do lean that way.  But I think I'm pretty realistic as far as being educated on both sides.  I do like that you're taking a few more shots at the system in general lately.  I do like that.  It's crazy.  I like that part.  Yeah, a lot of things need fixing.  I like that.  But I will point out the hypocrisies that go on on both sides.  You know?  Why? 
[00:19:00]  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  Steve and Ron Conkma.  Fox talk.  Raw, raw, raw.  Anthony, cheerleader for the party.  Oh, God.  Well, what are you?  What are you?  I think we should talk to this guy because...  He's on the S&P.  If you want a question, that'd be great.  That'd be great.  I had another Drew Boogie song in there, I think.  Look, here's the newest hit.  Fuck you, liberal.  Die.  Die.  I don't know, though.  Mimi Beardsley is giving Bowling for Behave a run for its money. 
[00:19:30]  I love Mimi Beardsley.  Mimi Beardsley.  They all peak at different times.  But I will say that Mimi Beardsley is weird because I don't realize...  I know it's me, but it doesn't sound like me, so I get caught listening to it.  Yes, it's a great number.  It's a great ditty.  Eat my ass.  My ass.  Mimi Beardsley.  Worst name ever.  There should be a live version.  That should be the big...  There's going to be a live version at a show on time.  Oh, would that be great.  Where the crowd will clap.  Come out.  Oh, Mimi Beardsley. 
[00:20:00]  I don't mean to give anything away, but that might be an idea that we're...  Oh, good.  Oh, would that be great.  I think we're hitting the road again, right?  Oh, if we hit the road and we all get to sing the respective songs live.  I completely agree.  Not only that, but maybe some extra...  Some other things live, too.  Oh, well.  Stay tuned, people.  Like what?  Live bait?  Stay tuned.  Live bait?  They're going to bring out worms?  Live?  Live bait?  Just a wheelbarrow full of live bait? 
[00:20:30]  Just dump it on the stage?  It's guess how many worms are in there, but then no one wants to count it.  I kind of like the bit.  I kind of like the idea now.  Live bait.  Or some valuable ring or something in the middle of fucking worms.  Oh, my God.  Worms.  That's two fucking old school radio crap.  Old school radio.  I'm debating the location, which we have not announced yet, though.  Oh, yeah?  We'll talk about it after.  You're debating the location.  I am.  I like the location.  I do, too.  My God.  That's actually one of my favorite locations.  I think that location will bring in a lot of people from other locations. 
[00:21:00]  You've got to remember that, too.  Why?  They're going to come from the right, and they're going to come to the left.  They're going to come up a little bit.  And I'm worried.  Maybe down a little bit if they know how to get down from there.  Will they come up, though?  Oh, yeah.  They will.  I don't know.  Will they?  Yeah, they will.  Oh, will they?  Oh, yeah.  Look at that location.  Look how nice that location is.  Dude, it's one of my favorite places.  Look.  You might have to do a roundabout, but you could get there.  Look.  You might have to go around.  Oh, a little bit. 
[00:21:30]  Go around a little bit.  Digging.  Digging, digging, digging.  It's watery.  I have watery mucus.  Hey, funny or die yesterday.  Yeah.  Had a post called the 11 more nostalgic activities today's kids will never experience.  It's kind of a bit we've done, but they've added to the list a little bit.  Yeah.  But they make some good.  They bring back some good memories that a lot of us older people have forgotten.  For example, not knowing what was on TV while you were watching TV. 
[00:22:00]  Remember, you would fucking turn on the TV.  There was no TV guide.  There was no program guide.  Well, it was in the newspaper.  What was the magazine?  The TV Guide, which I used to love.  TV Guide.  They're talking before even TV Guide, where you would just turn on the fucking TV and  have to figure out what the hell was on.  Look, I don't remember that shit.  I always remember there being a guide.  Do you remember a guide?  Always.  And I remember like Newsday used to have it.  I don't think we had a guide because we were poor.  Newsday's Sunday paper.  We didn't get the paper.  We didn't get TV Guide in my house. 
[00:22:30]  Well, that's crazy.  So I am one of these people.  Aw.  Newsday used to have the Sunday paper, and then they would have the little TV Guide that  came with the paper, and you'd use that all week.  So you always had a TV Guide in your house?  Always had a TV Guide, but...  Very fortunate.  It sucked at...  You were rich.  Yeah, I was rich.  We didn't have that.  You didn't want to go through it, though.  Like, you just kind of did rally around the channels a little bit because...  Rally around the channels?  Yeah.  Pocket full of shells.  It was a pain they had us to pick up a TV Guide and thumb through it. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Well, I definitely remember no TV Guide or no program guide on the TV.  Dude, do you remember getting the TV Guide when you would get the magazine?  Because we had a subscription to it or whatever.  And I would look through it and go right to Don Kirshner's rock concert to see if it  was a Saturday night to see if KISS was going to be.  I was only looking for KISS back then.  I hear it, Larry.  And there was a couple of other ones.  What was the Dick Clark one?  There was Don Kirshner and then there was American Band...  Not American Bandstand.  No, there was...  He tried... 
[00:23:30]  Wolf Van Jack.  No, no, no.  This was a big one.  This was on for years.  Midnight Special.  Midnight Special.  That was Wolf Van Jack was on it.  Oh, okay.  Midnight Special.  And I would always look for that and especially Don Kirshner to see if KISS was on.  Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we have KISS on Don Kirshner's rock concert.  Dude, it was amazing to look through the TV Guide and see them listed.  I would go crazy when I'd see KISS.  I would start going...  I would make these little nervous tics when I'd see KISS meets the Phantom. 
[00:24:00]  You would make a little nervous.  Yeah, I was so...  I was so excited.  You're like a little fucking Yorkie.  You roll over and piss yourself.  Oh, dude, I was so excited.  KISS brought an excitement level out of people, absolutely.  That's hilarious, Jimmy.  I used to love KISS too, but I grew up.  Yeah, you would make noises and twitches when they would be on fucking Don Kirshner's rock concert. 
[00:24:30]  I used to search out the rock magazines with KISS in them and all that.  And you'd have to wait all week.  Circus magazine or whatever the fuck it was at the time, right?  Yeah.  You'd have to wait all week for your...  You'd have to wait all week then.  And it would...  Just to see who was hosting like SNL and all that crap?  Yeah.  Because then when we did have access to that shit, yeah, you would search out your programs  to see who was hosting whatever we were performing.  No on-screen guides, though.  That was, you know, things that you didn't even think about.  And you had to get up to change the channels.  Right.  Let me tell you, kids.  The other one they added to the list was knowing the satisfaction of watching live TV. 
[00:25:00]  Remember the portable TVs?  The portable...  Now, obviously, we could watch anything we want on our phones.  Yeah.  But remember, like, there was a big event.  Maybe you had to fucking go to a stupid wedding and the Super Bowl was on or a big football game  and someone always had that portable TV with the shitty reception, trying to get a signal  so you could, you know, catch a glimpse of the game.  That was pretty goddamn good.  Did you have one of those portable TVs?  Uh, not that early on, so it wasn't, like, a real novelty. 
[00:25:30]  By the time I got one, it was like, meh, everyone's got one.  Well, that was when you had the...  It was on your phone or first started on satellite, right?  Yeah, yeah.  But even before that, I had, like, a portable TV handheld, but it was with the antenna and everything.  But the cool thing, not many people had them.  So when you found someone that had them, it was kind of cool for the time.  Yeah.  But I had it so late.  It's hard to talk this way because we all have our phones, and like I said, you can watch anything you want.  And now those are totally obsolete, even if you had one, because if you dig it out and put batteries in it, 
[00:26:00]  there's no signal to receive them.  Yeah, there's really no...  Yeah, it was funny.  I was at a garage sale, and somebody had one of those old, you know, the portable TVs, and I was like, oh, that's cool.  And the guy's like, yeah, it still works.  And I'm like, no, it doesn't.  And he's like, oh, yeah, it does.  And I just didn't feel like getting into it.  Getting into the fact that it's a digital signal now.  When did the portable TV come out?  Oh, man.  It's a lot earlier than we think, that's for sure.  They're showing the Sony Watchmen in this picture.  Do you remember in Wall Street when he's holding this little two-inch screen, and he's showing Charlie Sheen, 
[00:26:30]  and then he goes, yeah, for Rudy, like his kid was a big tech buff.  But that was, it was so funny.  We make fun of the big phone he had.  Ah, but he had a handheld TV.  A little TV, but it was like a little square.  It was so...  It was probably the Watchmen.  And at the time, I bet you thought, it's never going to get better than this.  Nope.  Look at all the cool stuff we have now.  It's really hard to think it's going to get better than this.  But it will.  But it will.  We'll look back on this.  It will.  Or like Cheryl Crowe has a brain tumor.  We'll look back on stuff like that and go like, wow, how did they get brain tumors? 
[00:27:00]  But now we can see cancer cells or benign tumor cells building when they're at 50 cells,  and they get wiped out by the little thing we have in us.  And we never get cancer anymore.  People used to really get tumors.  You can't...  Nanotechnology.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Her brain tumor is all right, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, it's benign.  Or but 10.  She's almost...  She's, yeah, she's being pretty casual about it, actually.  I kind of remember seeing that.  Of course you do.  Yeah.  I think we had some of those.  I remember that.  The Panasonic.  That's the 70s.  What do you mean?  70s.  You had one at AF.  No, no.  That's the one that ended up in the ice. 
[00:27:30]  No, no.  Something similar to that.  Oh, no.  Mine was a cheaper...  That's like 70s.  How big was your portable TV at AF?  I think it was about a 5-inch, something like that.  No, but how deep?  Oh, it was pretty deep, yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  So it was a 5-inch screen, and it went back maybe 10 inches?  Yeah.  It was pretty stupid.  That's a great story.  Ant leaves his cool portable TV after our radio show, and Rocco and his gang put it on ice. 
[00:28:00]  They were stacking everything up in the corner, and it was a bus tray with ice cubes in it.  Right.  And they just put the TV on the ice, thinking it's another solid thing to just stack it on, and when the ice melted, I came in the next day, and my TV was in a bucket of water.  Dummies.  I know it wasn't done on purpose, but...  No, no.  It was done out of complete stupidity.  Right.  Not really appreciating the fact that ice melts.  But you had one?  Yeah.  Because we didn't have TVs in the studio back then, huh?  Yeah, right?  So we needed that TV to kind of see what the fuck was going on in the world? 
[00:28:30]  That's pretty fucking silly.  Then, of course, they move on to the Discman.  I don't know.  These are, I guess, things that...  I don't know if we actually miss them.  No, I don't miss a fucking Discman, that's for sure.  But, you know, when you finally realize, holy fuck, I could bring my CDs and leave my house with them?  Yeah.  I don't have to play them in my car?  You needed a good buffering on it, though.  Yeah, the skip protection buffering.  But you accepted that, because it was so cool.  Yep.  One at a time, you'd have to put them in. 
[00:29:00]  And it is amazing how fucking fast everything has turned.  Like, I look at that right now, like it's a fucking cave wall drawing.  That little portable TV Danny's got up on.  Yeah, right.  But it was pretty cool when it came out.  Oh, hell yeah.  Absolutely.  Absolutely, it was cool.  That was your lifeline right there to a ball game or something.  But the Discman, holy fuck.  Yeah.  You know, I saw somebody was talking about radio.  Bring it to the beach and shit.  People would look at the radio.  I was watching someone talk about radio, and they said, years ago, when you listen to the radio,  you'd gather around and look at the radio.  Yeah, what the fuck is that about?  Like, when nobody had TV, before TV, they would all sit around when the game was on 
[00:29:30]  and fucking stare at the radio.  How stupid is that?  They were dummies.  How weird is that?  What do you think the players are going to fall out, you cunts?  Yeah, you kind of...  What was that about?  Stare at the fucking radio.  Why wouldn't you get a nice chair and just close your eyes?  Just a gathering place, I guess.  Yeah.  I'm talking about nostalgic activities that kids today will never experience.  Yeah.  This one's great.  Hanging out with friends without...  They are all looking at the radio. 
[00:30:00]  Yes.  A bunch of dummies.  Oh, no one had to force the radio.  Face the radio.  Let's look at the radio.  That's so...  I got a nice fucking old radio in my house.  I don't turn it on, though.  It just looks cool.  Works?  Yeah, it does, actually.  Nice.  Like Twilight Zone.  It got old stations.  It's as tall as that one.  It's a different model than the one.  Ooh.  Different here, but...  I like old radios.  I guess back then, when you grew up just with no technology, and then all of a sudden, magic  voices are coming out of a box. 
[00:30:30]  Yes.  It's pretty fucking amazing.  Yeah.  Everything's amazing when it first comes out.  Yeah, the light bulb was probably pretty amazing.  We don't even think twice about it.  Some of Thomas Edison's electricity.  First time someone just popped that switch and light appeared.  Oh.  Fucking amazing.  Imagine seeing that for the first time.  You're like, what the fuck?  What the fuck is this?  Menlo Park.  The next one, hanging out with friends without any distractions.  Now, we all know, today, it's just like, you can barely have a conversation with anyone.  There was a very short-lived... 
[00:31:00]  Facebooking and Twittering and...  Very short-lived phase of when people thought it was rude to be out and go on your phone.  Right.  Remember that?  And it was like, hey, hey, hey.  It was rude.  And then it just, like, got plowed under any type of civility or manners.  As far as not using your phone.  It's completely accepted.  Now, it doesn't matter.  At one point at our table at Sam's wedding, we all were on our phones.  Yeah.  At one point.  We were conversing and stuff, but, you know. 
[00:31:30]  There was a very short time, though, where people would be like, oh, God, look, he's on  his phone.  Yeah, it wasn't that cool.  We're at dinner.  Now, it doesn't matter.  Colin got mad at me once, years ago.  Maybe four years ago.  Five years ago.  I'm from Mudgeon.  Four years ago, because he was telling me something that I thought he was just, he was bothered  by something.  But I didn't realize he was bothered by it.  And I was just fucking with him.  Tell him not to shut up.  And I'm looking at my phone.  But then he was really pissed at me.  Oh, wow.  Because he was telling me something.  And I was, was he going on your fucking phone and ignoring me?  Like, oh, I didn't.  But now he's always on the phone, because he wasn't as much of a texter back then. 
[00:32:00]  And then, of course, fucking him and his stupid fucking, his fairy fingers.  And I mean fairy, like mystical creature fingers.  Now he can't get enough of his dumb iPhone, so his face is always buried in it.  But now it's, you're right, it's so much more accepted now than even a few years ago.  Now nobody cares if you're on your phone constantly.  No, they're not going to bitch too much about it.  By the way, our pal Colin is having a birthday today.  Oh, is he really?  Oh.  Not a special birthday.  It's just his birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday to Colin. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Big fucking deal, I say.  Guy who can't wish his friend a happy birthday, because it's not cool.  Happy birthday, stupid.  Because it's not cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, fuck him.  Fuck that shit.  The next one.  Wow, I remember this.  Feeling the thrill of recording your favorite song.  Kids today, remember you were like, whatever it was, Zeppelin, Metallica, you name it.  And you would just, you would, you would just wait for the radio to play and push fucking  record.  Oh my God.  You would miss the first couple seconds, obviously, because you, you know, you're waiting for 
[00:33:00]  the song.  Wow.  Or sometimes you would guess and hope that it was the next song.  Wow.  I remember there was one time, I guess a radio station was like away for like the long July  fourth weekend, so they were playing like the same three hours of radio over and over  again, and like the new Green Day song that just came out, and I just sat by my radio  with the tape waiting.  With like record and play was already down, it was just on pause.  Right.  So all I had to do was unpause it.  Unpause, motherfucker.  That's right.  Yeah.  We all did that to just, you know, get our music on a cassette.  Oh, man.  Dual deck.  Is that when you could record cassette to cassette? 
[00:33:30]  How cool is that?  Yeah.  With your high speed dubbing.  High speed dub.  High speed dubbing ruled.  Fucking ruled.  Remember?  It did, yeah.  Giant boombox.  And then Napster just hit it out of the park.  You forget, because now we get any song we want.  But remember when Napster first hit, you're like, wait, what?  Yeah.  I remember my computer was so shitty, I downloaded an MP3, I mean, it took 20 minutes, and then  my computer couldn't play it.  The processor wasn't good enough.  But Napster, fucking.  Yeah, yeah.  Before that, they accepted you were going to record shit off the radio. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  But for some reason, then, you know, getting a really good copy, that was a no-no.  I forgot about, like, waiting for the radio to play the song so you could tape it.  That's fucked up.  So then you could play whenever the fuck you wanted.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Like a computer or any of that shit.  That's the only way you would get a song.  Computer.  Especially if you were poor.  And really, how forward-thinking was Star Trek?  Like, you're just talking to computers, asking for things, and then there it is.  Yeah.  And that's all we're doing.  That's all we're doing, really. 
[00:34:30]  Crazy.  Yeah.  Next one.  You forget, but you used to have to get up early on Saturday morning just to watch cartoons.  That was the only time they fucking played them.  As a kid, you would kind of get up early anyway.  It wasn't like I was hungover back then.  Right.  But I'd wake up, and I was a fucking madman for cartoons as a kid.  I loved cartoons, but you had to make sure you got up early to watch them.  You had to get up early.  And I remember, like, asking for...  Some of the first memories I have is asking my mom if today was the day the good cartoons are on. 
[00:35:00]  What were the good cartoons?  Well, that's Saturday.  Saturday morning, because I didn't know what day it was.  I was a kid.  I had no concept of days, so I just would wake up and go, is today the good day for good cartoons?  What were your cartoons?  Your go-tos.  Oh, my God.  Bugs Bunny, obviously.  Bugs was great.  Flintstones was huge for us.  Yeah.  The Jetsons, I fucking loved.  Yeah, yeah.  I hated the Jetsons and the Flintstones.  I loved it.  As a kid, I liked those.  It was a look at the future.  Oh, okay.  And what could happen in the future.  An eager boy looking forward. 
[00:35:30]  But I was also a big fan of Underdog and Tennessee Tuxedo and Fractured Fairy Tales.  Yes.  Yeah, that was like my go-to shit.  What about McGill or Gorilla?  McGill or Gorilla was good.  That was always on.  That dumb McGill.  I don't even know if that one holds up, but we watched that one a lot.  I remember that song.  How much is that monkey in the window?  Would he say monkey or gorilla?  Should he say monkey or gorilla?  How much?  You got it?  Turn this up. 
[00:36:00]  We've got a gorilla for sale.  McGill or Gorilla.  See the window.  McGill or Gorilla.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened.  Handsome, elegant, intelligent, sweet.  Not right.  He's really handy.  You need the whole song.  Come on, a little gorilla you can call your own.  Does that work, Iraq?  When you win, you're out of the world.  Sorry about that.  The McGill or Gorilla.  Show. 
[00:36:30]  Presented by Ideal Toys.  Oh, Ideal Toys.  Ideal Toys.  I don't remember.  Ideal.  Ideal.  Is that company still around?  You know what dumb one I liked?  Mighty Mouse.  Mighty Mouse was great.  Oh, I used to watch that, too.  Yes.  That was another one I used to watch on Saturday morning.  Oh, Mighty Mouse.  And then it all turned to shit when, like, noon whirled around and the Bowery Boys came  on.  Saturday morning, cartoons were always over when, what was that disco show? 
[00:37:00]  Soul Train.  Soul Train.  Oh, right.  Yes.  Soul Train came on.  It was like, ah.  This is over.  That's the end of the cartoons.  This is over.  What about, um...  Now you can just watch cartoons whenever you want, obviously.  The Mighty Mouse song.  So the kids won't know that shit.  Can we hear the Mighty Mouse song?  I remember, I loved Mighty Mouse when I was a kid.  Yeah.  I haven't watched that probably since Thursday.  Mighty Mouse.  I never watched cartoons as an adult.  Never.  No?  No, man.  I love watching cartoons, though.  I dropped off, but I really used to in my 20s. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, they really put their all into these songs.  Probably the best cartoon song ever.  This is a good one.  I can't listen to this, though, without thinking of Andy Kaufman's bit.  What a simple bit, but what a great bit. 
[00:38:00]  He just fucking stood there for the whole song.  Took balls.  And then did that, here I come to sing.  Do you have that?  He would just mouth the words.  And he mouth the words and moved his arm like that.  If you've never stood there.  Put this on our Facebook page.  This was on SNL.  He's standing there, yeah, just in a suit.  Like an idiot.  He's looking sheepish.  Standing there stoically.  Very meek.  Now he's mouthing this part.  And then he just waits again. 
[00:38:30]  The people did not know what the fuck to think.  He's an old record player next to him.  We still don't know what the fuck to think.  I know.  Just waiting.  Waiting.  He's trying to sing, but it's not time yet.  He fucked up.  Yeah.  His hands moving like big A's.  He's all nervous.  Goes to sing at the wrong time.  What a strange fucking guy.  He's kind of brilliant.  Yeah, it was funny.  Because it fucking worked. 
[00:39:00]  He's still waiting.  Waiting for his part again.  Waiting.  Waiting.  He gives it his all.  Very overdramatic.  Yes.  I don't know.  It is funny.  People either love this guy or fucking hate him.  Now he's just drinking water waiting.  Yeah.  I liked a lot of his stuff.  Very professional.  Very strange, but...  Very unique. 
[00:39:30]  He's getting ready again.  The funny thing is he's getting his lips wet.  Yeah.  Like he's...  He drank some water.  Yeah.  And there he is again.  It's just nonsense.  It was idiotic, but funny.  But I mean, that's fucking, what, 30 years ago?  Oh, easily.  Maybe more.  He did that type of alternative stuff before anybody else.  And there was no rooms for it.  Right.  When it was at fucking Catch a Rising Star.  It just annoyed people. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  People were fucking annoyed by that.  Yeah, you gotta remember all that stuff.  When Andy Kaufman came around, no one was doing shit like that.  No one.  He was not a performance artist.  I mean, that was just...  Right, right.  He was legit.  He really was that guy.  He wasn't some fucking...  He wasn't some unfunny dude trying to find a way to be in a funny situation by pretending  he didn't care about being funny.  No, that was him.  He really was that fucking lunatic.  That's great.  But the next thing, we're looking at stuff that kids will just not do nowadays that  we did.  Triaging your music for vacations. 
[00:40:30]  What's that mean?  Well, basically, we have our phone, we go away, every song we want to hear is on our phone  we have access to, but there was a time you had all your cassettes or CDs, and you had  to decide which ones were going to make the cut.  Right.  Yep.  Remember that?  I remember that, yeah.  You would sit there like, oh, fuck, I don't know, oh, God.  You can't take all these cassettes.  Cassettes.  Oh, I got the cassette.  You remember the little, it was like a little mini album cover in your cassette, it was 
[00:41:00]  so cool.  I didn't have eight tracks.  I remember my dad having eight tracks.  My older sister had eight tracks.  It was how to fold up a matchbook and kind of shove it in the side to keep it from bouncing  around in the car.  I love that they couldn't figure out how to make one long track.  It had to be two tracks for one long song.  Yeah.  Was it really?  Yeah, the song actually stopped.  They didn't have the technology yet, and you had to fucking push the next track to have  the song continue.  In the middle of the song, it would fade out.  Like, you'd fucking just...  No. 
[00:41:30]  Yes!  The song would fade out, and then you'd hear, this big mechanical clicking noise, and then  it would fade back up again in the middle of the song.  Right.  Because they couldn't, the way the A-track worked, there was no way to really time it  out where there was nothing there, like where the song would end at a certain time.  Just the weirdest fucking...  It faded out, though?  I thought it just ended abruptly.  I remember them fading out.  I guess they figured, all right, let's at least fade this part of the song out, and then  fade it back up in the next track.  Really weird.  How long was the A-track in Cars for? 
[00:42:00]  Not that long.  How long was the A-track?  Was that kind of like a quick transient one?  That wasn't that long, right?  It was pretty quick.  I guess it was during the early 70s.  Maybe even to the 77?  What do you mean the A-track was quick?  It was a short life?  Yeah.  I don't remember it being all that long.  I had no idea.  I remember it, but I never had one, and I don't have any memories.  It's like the LaserDisc.  I knew it existed, but I don't remember having any...  I remember having cassettes eventually. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  If my father had an A-track, I don't remember it.  And the trunk was full of just A-tracks laying around.  Melted.  Soaked in foxhead oil.  Or it would have a bubble from sun.  Yeah.  But overheated.  Maybe you'd save stuff when one technology would end to the next one, like cassettes are  over, but you'd save them just in case they came back.  Gotta save that.  Gotta save that one.  I still got some of those carts in my closet.  That's kind of another thing people don't...  That's like an antique, an artifact these days. 
[00:43:00]  That fucking metal funnel thing you used to have to slam into the top of the round oil  cans when you had to put oil in your car.  Like, no one uses those anymore.  It's all plastic.  Fucking screw them off.  And it would spill all over the fucking valve cover and smoke all over the car.  I forgot all about that.  Those things sucked.  They always leaked.  Do we have a date on that, then, or no?  Is it?  Not like a hard date, but it said by the late 70s they were beginning to be phased out.  Phased out?  When did they start?  In cars, or just as a... 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, both.  I'm just curious.  I have no memory of them.  I bet you the technology started in the late 60s, but early 70s is when everyone really  started getting it, I would guess.  My dad had one in 72.  So by 1980 they were probably gone.  Oh, yeah.  They were done by then.  I think 77, around there, is pretty much fucking over.  Were cassettes around then in 79?  Yeah, cassettes started...  Cassettes were known for just recording audio.  They didn't really think of them as a music thing.  66 was when they became commercially successful.  Really?  Okay, so people would play them in their house and stuff, in their groovy new stereo. 
[00:44:00]  Groovy.  Buck's stereos!  Buck's super stereo world.  The last few we could go...  This isn't fair.  We could go through quickly, because we've done this.  Remembering phone numbers.  Kids today, obviously, don't have to remember phone numbers.  You literally had to fucking memorize shit.  Yeah, memorize it here.  You don't have to memorize anything.  It was in your head.  All your friends' phone numbers, your phone number, everything.  In your head.  This one we never talked about, hoping your nearest movie theater got the movie you wanted  to see.  Holy fuck, that's right.  No multiplex, motherfucker.  No multiplex. 
[00:44:30]  No one theater.  If it was Animal House, or trying to think of the movies from the late 70s, early 80s,  sometimes you had to fucking travel.  You had to wait or travel, yeah.  As a 17, 18-year-old, you're like, holy fuck, we're traveling just to see this movie.  Walt Whitman Mall was the big place to go for the movies.  But it was one or two theaters back then.  Yeah, it was like two, I think.  Maybe two.  Or the Elwood Cinemas on Jericho Turnpike was a big one for me, until the Comac Multiplex  came up, before it turned into pretty much a gang-killing land. 
[00:45:00]  They've been good lately, right?  Have they?  I haven't been there in fucking centuries.  I haven't heard any stories lately.  Yeah.  It was pretty scary there for a while.  Oh, yeah.  Checking box scores in the morning.  Box.  That's how you got your fucking, you know, to see if your team won or not.  You couldn't check your ESPN app or anything like that.  You had to wait.  And then finally not having access to everything ever.  That's how we ended the list. 
[00:45:30]  Everything ever.  Is right there at your fingertips.  That is pretty much the way it is.  You would have to go to a library or find someone that was knowledgeable on a subject.  You didn't know shit.  I just remember, like, seeing somebody on TV and toiling over, where did I see that person?  They were in a movie.  And then it just for hours would annoy you and just fucking pound in your head.  Or that's why.  Now you just, oh, IMDb.  That's why the encyclopedias were huge.  Yeah.  You know, but. 
[00:46:00]  Giant encyclopedia sets.  But TV would choose what they were going to teach you.  Yeah.  If it was some cool, like, I don't know.  We didn't even really have documentaries or any of that shit, if you think about it.  Yeah, Channel 13.  A little bit.  Yeah, yes.  You would get some shit like that, but.  Not a lot, though.  Yeah.  And then the encyclopedias, like, within two years were dated.  They were, right?  Especially back then.  Like, borders were moving in Southeast Asia and in Europe.  And you just, it's just what it was.  Do you think encyclopedias are a good investment now?  Like, to invest in an encyclopedia company? 
[00:46:30]  And someone going door to door?  Can I just knock on your door and say encyclopedia?  Encyclopedia.  They haven't killed.  Encyclopedia Britannica just stopped their paper printing.  That was it?  That was it.  That was it.  When?  They just, just like this year, stopped.  Really?  What tipped them off?  Did they sell four encyclopedias worldwide?  Who the fuck buys them?  Yeah.  No, no.  Google, by the way.  Whoever, those Surge and the other guy who did Google is an amazing fucking invention.  Yeah.  I guess it's all part of Ask Jeeves or an extension of that, whatever the fuck. 
[00:47:00]  But Google is a genius invention, man.  It really is just a wonder of man.  Whatever's next is going to be even better.  Well, it's going to be Facebook, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be Facebook.  $27, $26 a share.  I didn't know what was next.  No.  So I just kind of said it would be better.  I know.  I ran out of steam on that one.  Oh, whatever's next will be better?  It's going to get worse somehow.  Yeah, exactly.  Like you'll enter something in Google and a big question mark will come up on your screen. 
[00:47:30]  We don't know either.  I have no idea.  But what is the next step?  It's like maybe it'll just be because they theorized that when you just think of something,  you'll know it.  Yeah.  Because your brain will automatically Google it once we can think and move computers.  Yeah.  A more organic interface.  I think Google Glasses is that what it's called?  Yeah, Google Glasses.  Yeah, whatever happened to that.  Where's the Google Glasses?  They're still working on the contacts and stuff.  Maybe not Google, but Cock, who did a great lecture. 
[00:48:00]  Cock.  I watched it.  It was an hour lecture.  I watched 25 minutes of it.  And he was talking about those contact lenses where everything's just in front of you.  And that's amazing.  But my thing is, how do you stop?  And this is, they'll figure this out.  When you're thinking to make your computer do something, how do you stop all the random  crazy thoughts to come in?  Just watch shit popping up on the fucking Jim's computer screen.  Yeah, you're having it.  Like the films they were showing fucking Alex and...  Yeah.  In Clockwork Orange.  You were at work presenting something, and all of a sudden just the words fart juice 
[00:48:30]  pops up on the fucking window.  I don't know why I'm thinking that.  Fart juice!  I don't know.  That would be scary at first, but then people in general will think, ah, it's no big deal.  Get used to it.  That everyone's thinking weird shit.  Right.  I don't know about that.  That would be weird at first, though.  Yeah.  For sure.  I don't know.  That would be weird.  There's got to be a way.  You're like, oh, boy.  Filtering it out or corridoring it, so...  Yeah.  Like, do it in advance.  Look, man.  Our dead dads are knowing everything we're thinking about, Ant, so... 
[00:49:00]  Oh, right.  That's already happening to us.  It's around.  Oh, I hope dead relatives...  I think of that, too.  Does my grandmother know?  Oh, she's watching you?  Does my grandmother know?  How about them watching you just fucking ravaging?  Oh.  Jacking up, edging.  That's why every time I read...  Come already.  Grandma's looking down going, come already.  Come already.  I want to go to bed.  You animal.  Yes.  Fucking do something productive with your life.  Other grandmothers are watching their grandsons have their own kids and get their diplomas and their doctorates.  And you're edging. 
[00:49:30]  You're edging for fucking ten hours.  Waiting for the skirt to pop up and see how big it is.  Will you just go to sleep?  Fucking piece of garbage.  That's why every time a relative comes up to me and goes, oh, he knows.  Like, I'll go, ah, it's a shame my dad's not here for whatever.  The birth of my son, I would say.  And then a relative always has to step up.  Oh, he knows.  What do you think?  I just look at him and go, yuck.  What do you think?  They just know?  Yuck.  They only know the good shit?  They know not to look when you're fucking just banging.  Well, I'll accept he doesn't know the good shit if he doesn't know the bad shit. 
[00:50:00]  You know what I mean?  Looking down while you're just fucking very face deep in ass.  Right.  Oh, he likes ass.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Well, then again, I did too, son.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, I don't believe they know.  That's why I hate that relative shit.  Oh, he knows.  Believe me, he's looking down.  Really?  That means he's looking down at all this shit.  Yeah.  But are they looking down into a screen?  Or is it through a glass floor?  Yeah.  How are they seeing?  And how much does heaven suck that they're watching me?  And who decides that it's a looking down thing? 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That they're in the heavens.  And then what if he wants to look at somebody else on the other side of the world?  Does it take a while to get over there to look?  Right.  Can you instantly change it?  And then what?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  It's like chat roulette.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like chat roulette.  Let's see what my son's up to right now.  Yeah.  Can he turn it off?  Or is he always fucking looking?  Yeah, he's always looking.  There's nothing else to do.  You nosy buddy.  What are you going to do?  Go fuck a celebrity up there, dad.  Leave me alone.  Spirits in heaven just beating off hitting next. 
[00:51:00]  No, no, no, no.  Maybe.  No, no, no.  Oh, maybe.  That's a good one.  Oh, that's funny.  Yeah.  Couldn't you be up there trying to look up Marilyn Monroe's skirts?  What are you doing?  Leave me alone, pups.  Yeah, exactly.  You can do anything in heaven.  Why are you fucking looking?  Wasting your time on me.  Yeah, checking in on me.  What do you got, Roland?  What do you got, Roland?  Yeah, what do you got?  Let's see.  Who is a big sister shit that we're not going to want to say?  Who's that? 
[00:51:30]  What picture you got, Jimmy?  Oh, just my friend's got a lovely young lady named Jenny McCarthy to sign our photo together.  Oh.  Your old Jenny McCarthy.  She's a riot.  She's hilarious.  Oh, let's see.  No, no.  Safe house?  What is safe house?  It's the movie with the best tagline ever.  What was the tagline of safe house?  Nothing is safe.  Oh, damn.  Oh, my God.  That's when he goes, do I make you nervous?  Oh, that's the Ryan Reynolds Denzel one.  Oh, right.  More Denzel.  Wow.  Inside man. 
[00:52:00]  American gangster.  Are we going to get Denzel Washington?  They're just in the blue rays.  He couldn't even fake it.  You know what?  I've never seen American Gangster.  It's very good.  Frank, we had Frank in.  It was great.  I've never seen American Gangster.  The other two, I don't want.  Who wants my safe house copy and my inside man copy?  Safe house is pretty good.  I'm not watching safe house.  Why?  Because I don't want it.  Jodie Foster and Clive Owen?  What is this?  Here, give these to somebody else.  I don't even remember the last time I popped a fucking Blu-ray in a machine.  No, I still watch them once in a while. 
[00:52:30]  I just fucking go right to either On Demand or I go to fucking Netflix.  American Gangster was good.  I'm so close to throwing every single one of my DVDs away.  Don't need them.  I'm so close.  Don't need them.  I feel attached to them for some reason.  You feel attached to them?  I don't even know the last time I actually opened that draw.  Draw.  Draw.  Draw.  Long Island accent came out there.  And grabbed a DVD.  I still watch them.  Here's what I need to get rid of.  In my basement.  I recently redid all my fucking storage units. 
[00:53:00]  Put everything in hard plastic things.  Is the covers.  I save them to get them signed or whatever.  That makes sense for you.  But they're in my storage unit.  They were taking up too much room.  So what I'll do is I'll just.  I'll go to the interns or I'll get it the day before.  I'll say, Kenny, someone's supposed to come in.  Could you grab JFK?  I don't buy.  I don't go down and get them ever.  I got to toss 90% of them.  My CDs I pretty much threw away recently.  Yeah.  I gave them to one of my brother-in-laws.  He went through my collection to get some shit.  And I never got them back.  I just was.  Worthless.  I was like, yeah.  They're in a box down in Philly somewhere. 
[00:53:30]  I don't need them.  That shit's worthless.  It kind of is, right?  The music.  That stuff is.  But the DVDs.  I burn shit illegally.  I burn shit illegally all the time when I need a nice fucking, you know.  Yeah.  You need to burn.  A chunk of music.  Burn.  Yeah.  You don't even have to burn anything anymore.  It's like.  Media is uncomfortable.  It's just there.  You plug in in your car.  You plug in your fucking phone.  I say fuck the artist.  Get right through there.  Taking your shit.  Oh, shit.  Paul Williams ain't going to be happy with that one, motherfucker.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, damn. 
[00:54:00]  Was Inside Man good?  He's large and in charge.  All right.  He's in charge.  He's in charge.  Depends which one.  Taking your girl to the drive-in.  Yeah, man.  I would like to go to a drive-in.  There's still a couple.  I kind of like the drive-in thing.  There is one upstate New York, I think.  There is still a couple of them around there.  They're very rare.  I really want to go.  I saw one.  Kenny will remember where it was.  Oh.  But it was out of season when I was doing a gig there.  But I do want to go to a drive-in movie.  Yeah?  Yes.  I just hated the sound.  It's like. 
[00:54:30]  But remember how cool it was to see a movie outside?  It was cool.  As a kid, I used to go to my pajamas.  Yeah.  Kenny, where's the drive-in?  Yeah.  With a little pillow or a fucking sleeping bag.  And then.  Lay out in front of the car.  You'd have to sit there in the back seat.  No.  Because the parents were in the front seat.  And you'd have to deal with dad farting.  And, you know.  Maybe mom and dad arguing. 
[00:55:00]  When everyone went outside, there were two, maybe three spots on the windshield that were  cool.  Because you could kind of like lounge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You used to like lay out on the hood of the car.  And everyone else was uncomfortable.  And on the roof, you'd put a blanket on like the roof of the fucking car.  That shit was cool.  I forgot about that shit.  I'd do that tomorrow.  That fucking shit.  I remember I was trying to get my dad.  My dad took me to see some movie at the drive-in.  I don't remember what.  But the sensuous nurse was the late movie with Ursula Andress.  Or the sensual nurse.  I was trying to get him to stay and watch that.  But he just wouldn't.  He probably didn't want to get a rod in the car with his 12-year-old. 
[00:55:30]  I did, man.  I fucking, that stupid goddamn Barbarella movie was playing out in California when I was  out there.  That was porno.  And my father decides to have me go.  That was porno back then.  And I was sitting in the middle between him and his wife, Corey, my girlfriend at the  time.  Yeah.  And I don't think he knew what the fuck it was all about.  And the opening sequence, Jane Fonda is pretty much naked.  But it's like in almost silhouette, but a little more than just silhouette.  And she's floating in space, but she's like fucking naked.  And I swear to God, I was like starting to breathe heavy. 
[00:56:00]  I couldn't fucking feel.  I had a hard on.  I'm like, I'm sitting next to my dad.  It was fucking embarrassing.  There were many years you just couldn't control that.  You couldn't control it.  Now you can kind of like get your shit together if you have to.  And then I remember the fucking windshield was steamed up on the inside.  And that was all from you.  And my dad like rolled the window down to try to fucking.  That was because of you.  Oh, I.  Your young body was heating up.  I couldn't take it.  I think that's when he decided it was time to get Buzz. 
[00:56:30]  Time to get Buzz to fucking deal with it.  Gotta get the poison out of my son.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Wow.  You know, get Buzz quick lest I go to a man and become a faggot, like he said.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Fucking drive-ins.  Remembering that it was kind of cool.  You'd get to go to the snack stand.  Felt like you were on a little adventure.  Oh, yeah.  You go to the snack bar.  And then trying to find your way back to the car.  Crunching on that gravel.  Just dumb shit. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  But what.  And it was always too bright.  Remember?  Yeah.  Your eyes all adjust so you could get your dumb popcorn.  When would you go for this.  Would there be a break in the movie?  Well, they did a lot of double features and shit.  And little shorts before movies.  I'd like to do that.  I'd like to go to.  We come from a time, they used to have cartoons before movies started.  Remember?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like a quick five-minute, ten-minute cartoon.  Cartoon.  They should bring that shit back.  No one has fun.  But now they have to, you know, kill you with commercials. 
[00:57:30]  You've got to play the trailers and commercials.  And remember, we used to say, oh, they'll never have commercials before the movie.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a half hour of commercials now.  By the way, Comac Theater, supposedly, according to Anime 38, closed down four and a half years ago.  Is that possible?  What did?  Comac Motor Inn.  Comac Motor Inn.  Jesus.  The Multiplex?  Oops.  Comac Theater.  The Multiplex?  That's what this guy's saying.  Wow.  Wow.  I don't know if that's possible.  Wow. 
[00:58:00]  Enjoy our screen car.  Oh, there it is.  Don't need you.  Yeah.  Smoke, talk, relax in your own car.  It's always a cool show.  The Drive-In.  Oh, good show.  The Drive-In.  It's just a picture of a car with two white people sitting in it.  Of course.  Uh-oh.  It's a woodsy outdoor scene.  It's the intermission films. 
[00:58:30]  It's our concession.  Oh, so they did have, uh...  Well, back.  I mean, in a long time.  Yeah, of course.  Hurry, hurry, folks.  Get your crunchy, chewy, chocolatey candy bars now on the confession day.  Oh, look how plain that is.  Oh, my God.  That's tough.  For safety and courtesy's sake, drive 10 miles per hour or less.  Go with your children when they leave your car.  Uh-oh.  Use parking lights while driving.  Avoid horn blowing.  Go with your children.  Oh, boy.  It's probably because they don't want them getting hurt by the car. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Not even abducted.  They didn't care back then.  I wonder what would happen if you had a Drive-In open now.  Would people go for nostalgia reasons?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  And if you showed, like, ads like this in the middle with these two products?  There's probably so many insurance concerns, it would be impossible.  I know.  People driving around in a lot.  People walking.  You're always looking for shit to do when you have a family, so they absolutely would do well.  Our pizza pie.  Oh, yeah.  Made from a famous Italian recipe.  They're waiting for you at the concession stand.  Those look terrible.  Just shitty pizza.  Oh, hot dogs. 
[00:59:30]  Oh.  Yes, sir.  The hot dogs at our concession stand do rate an appreciative whistle.  Oh, I want a hot dog right now.  Whistle at your hot dog.  Your chamber of commerce works to make this community a better place to live and make a living in.  It needs your support.  You know what that means.  What?  You know.  Just make sure you don't sell your house to certain people.  Jesus.  All right.  That's great shit.  We should break.  We're going to have to watch that later. 
[01:00:00]  More guests today.  Holy fuck.  Yes.  The week of the guest on the Hopi and Anthony and Jim Norton show.  It's the Hopi and Anthony show.  I am merely a guest.  Tom Papa at 8 o'clock.  I think he's going to be at Gotham here in New York City.  So we'll help out Tom today.  And an old friend stopping by.  I haven't seen him in 10 years.  Really?  Colin Hanks.  10 years.  You saw him at the Springsteen show, right?  Yes.  Tom Hanks' brother.  Did I say Tom Hanks?  No.  Now I'm all confused.  It's Colin Hanks, obviously. 
[01:00:30]  Colin Hanks' son.  Colin Hanks' son.  But he's doing his own thing.  Yes.  When we first met him, he was absolutely Tom Hanks' son.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  But now he's done enough where it's fucking Colin Hanks.  Yeah.  He's made his own career.  Yeah.  Stepped out of his dad's shadow a bit.  So we'll talk to him.  Who's he in?  I know him, but I don't know what he's done.  Band of Brothers.  Fucking.  He was in that movie with Jack Black called The O.C.  Yeah.  He's done some shit.  Dexter.  That's right.  He was in Dexter. 
[01:01:00]  Yo's.  What's he doing these days?  Nothing.  I guess we'll talk to him about it.  I just want to say hi.  I guess we'll talk to him about it.  I want to go driving with a girl.  Hey, how you doing?  We'll just park, put the speaker in.  Yeah.  Yeah, you fucking.  You do the.  You don't put the speaker in anymore.  Oh, you don't?  They have low frequency.  It goes on your radio or something.  Low frequency.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  But now you've got digital radio.  They've got like 88.3 or something.  FM modulation.  Yes.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, there's no more speakers?  No.  Oh, what the fudge? 
[01:01:30]  Because people would drive away and just yank them out of the ground.  You don't want that big dumb metal speaker on your window.  Right.  Are you raining?  Oh, man.  It's raining.  It's pouring.  The old man is pouring.  Yeah, I remember when it would rain because you couldn't roll your window up all the way  because the little bracket for the speaker was in there.  So, like, water would get in your car.  Yeah, it was awful technology.  I remember driving home from my grandma's house at Waiting River.  Yeah.  They had a drive-in right outside Waiting River on 25A.  Really?  And it was just cool to see, like, the movie. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, it was playing as we were driving.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember when you would get a glimpse of a fucking movie playing as you were driving by?  Yeah.  And you would try to figure out what it is and stuff?  Oh, wow.  Oh, that's that new movie.  You'd think my parents would have stopped once.  Aw.  How about once we stopped at the drive-in on the way home?  You never did?  Nope.  And you used to have to, you'd find a great spot at the drive-in and then put the speaker  in it and realize the speaker didn't work.  Yeah.  And that's why no one was in that great spot.  Like, fucking speaker don't worry.  Turn that little knob. 
[01:02:30]  That speaker was a lethal weapon, too.  Just a big chunk of fucking forged iron.  Right.  It was crazy fucking heavy.  Lightning would hit that shit.  Oh, it's great.  Rattle your car.  Why don't we take a break and get into some other shit?  Nyah.  That's what I say.  Nyah.  Serious action.  Serious action.  Big Opie Realtree Show.  I'm at home with my dick of hearts.  I got the black book for a freak to call. 
[01:03:00]  Picked up the telephone, then dialed the seven digits and,  Yo, it's Marquise, baby.  Are you down with it?  I arrived at a house.  Knocked on the door.  Not having no idea of what the night had in store.  I'm like a dog in the heat.  A freak without warning.  I have an appetite for sex.  Cause me so darned.  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man. 
[01:03:30]  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  Two live crew, huh?  Yeah.  It was a big deal back then.  It was a big deal back then.  Is that what you're planning for?  It was a big deal back then.  How often do you get to hear this on the radio, too?  That's true.  I kind of liked two live crew for about a month or so.  Yeah.  We did.  Right?  Luther Campbell.  Why today?  22 years ago, it was ruled obscene by a federal judge.  Right.  That's 22 years ago.  Which song, though? 
[01:04:00]  Not this one.  This song.  And this album.  The album, maybe.  And then they have an album where he was, like,  draped in the American flag or something.  Banned in the USA.  But they did dirty stuff on the stage.  Or bandana or something.  Yeah.  He was a pig.  Where was the judge?  Was it Florida?  I don't think there was anything wrong with it,  but he was a pig.  Fucking Florida sucks, man.  That's the same place Max Hardcore got convicted for obscenity.  That whole fucking state stinks.  Yeah.  But they love us in Florida.  They're the worst. 
[01:04:30]  They like us.  Believe me.  They don't love us.  They like us.  Why was this obscene?  Well, it's hard to imagine now.  Yeah.  You've got to go back and think of the mindset we were all in.  Craziness.  You're right, by the way.  Why?  But, yeah, they had to change the album cover.  Yeah.  T-backs.  Yeah.  A bunch of chicks with their T-backs.  Rocko.  God.  R.I.P., sir.  R.I.P.  Yeah.  R.I.P.  The rock hole. 
[01:05:00]  The rock hole is no longer with us.  Oh.  But he used to love the T-backs.  T-backs.  Dude.  What did he die of?  I don't know.  Everything.  How old was he?  I think he had the diabetes.  Younger than us.  Rocko.  Probably early 40s.  Yeah.  So that's it on 2 Live Crew.  Anybody want to add to the discussion?  I forgot the name of the songs and everything at this point.  Yeah, the name really.  There was Me So Horny. 
[01:05:30]  That's the one we all know.  What was the one he got his dick sucked to on stage?  He was a dirty guy, Luther Campbell.  And what is he doing nowadays?  Is he on Twitter?  He still shows up once in a while at festivals.  What was his last tweet?  Give me his last tweet.  What is he doing right now?  Luther Campbell.  He's nostalgic at this point, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's considered kind of old school, I guess.  I wonder if he's in Ice-T's new movie.  Ah. 
[01:06:00]  Ice-T's documentary on the radio.  I noticed a slight pause there.  I want to make sure I got it right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ice-T's.  Yeah.  Douche.  That was great.  How far are we from Warwick, New York?  There's a drive.  Really, really far.  Are we?  Right here.  T-Yon.  Where's that?  Oh.  You got me, you darn devil.  You got me, you said a trap and I traipsed right into it with my, leading by my good 
[01:06:30]  nature.  Where is it?  Up there a little bit?  Yeah, it's like the North Jersey border.  North Jersey?  Oh, that's not that far.  That's not.  You thinking of going to a drive-in?  I want to fucking make, take a girl to a drive-in and wave my cock at her.  Oh.  You want to make time with her?  I want to make time with the girl.  Tell her if she spills popcorn and my beamer, I'll fucking cut her throat.  Sandy.  You got a drive-in.  Yeah.  Danny, why are you sitting on the stick shift?  And where's the other one? 
[01:07:00]  I'm being told an hour and 15 minutes, Jimmy.  Oh, that's not bad.  That's easy.  So is there, there's a drive-in in work?  Work.  Work.  I'd rather go to Peacewick.  Ah, I get it.  Double.  Double speakers.  Oh.  Why don't you go with David Bowie, by the way, Iraq?  We got a lot of Bowie fans out there.  Thank you.  Oh, boy.  40 years ago.  You weren't into the Bowie, were you?  Not a big Bowie guy at the time. 
[01:07:30]  Some of the heads, though, maybe?  Yeah, a couple of them.  Were you a modern love guy?  Take me to the church on time?  Modern love.  I don't know.  Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars 40 years ago.  Yeah, not a big fan of that whole glitter rock thing that he was doing.  Glam rock.  Glam rock, yeah.  He was part of the glam rock movement for a little while, right?  I don't know.  Not really that big a fan.  I played a lot of Bowie on the radio.  That's about it for me.  I didn't go too deep with Bowie. 
[01:08:00]  What's a cool Bowie song?  Like other men.  Suffering Gate City is okay.  I like Modern Love.  What is it?  And, of course, did I say it wrong?  Suffering Gate City or whatever?  Suffragette.  Oh, is it Suffragette?  Suffragette.  I was like, wait, what?  And I like Modern Love I really like.  I used to hate it, but I like it a lot.  I like that.  I like Space Oddity.  Oh, it's great. 
[01:08:30]  Wait, how do you know what movie is playing?  What the fuck's happening?  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  Why don't you just tell me what you want to see?  Yeah, we're on the website right now.  Danny's got it for you.  I see them, but they have Snow White.  Look, you can see Mission of...  Ah, Mission of...  Men in Black.  How do you know what night?  What's playing?  The Dictator.  Every night.  Avengers.  But there's six movies playing.  8.45.  Mm-hmm.  Men in Black 3D tonight.  It's already here.  The Dictator 10th.  And when are those playing?  I mean, when are they playing? 
[01:09:00]  The 8.45 and 11.10 or whatever.  When are they playing?  The Avengers and the other one.  When is that?  I want to see Men in Black and the Avengers.  How do I do that?  It says 8.45.  I guess they have multiple screens.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Multiple screen drive-in?  I don't know.  It's crazy.  They must have a lot of real estate up there.  You do donuts in the middle of the place and you watch a bunch of movies.  I don't know.  I'm looking at this website and it says open every night and then there's six movies and  some of them have the same start time.  Oh.  Interesting. 
[01:09:30]  You've got to get a lady first, though, Jimmy.  You've got a lady in mind.  I just want to go up with a buddy.  Oh, that would be cute.  I know it sucks.  The only guy I could probably do that with is Bob Kelly.  I could do anything with stupid Bob.  Yeah, stupid Bob will go.  But, um...  Remember the playgrounds that were in front?  Sure.  Like, there was a...  Right in front of the screen, right?  Like, playground.  That's so you can watch the movie and watch your kids at the same time.  And watch the dumb kids.  Yeah.  God, that's a good observation.  By the way, Iraq, why not the D-Day invasion?  That's a big one for Anthony.  I didn't really know what to play on that one.  The D-Day invasion was 68 years ago. 
[01:10:00]  Wow.  That's great.  Big day for America.  Amazing.  Was that an amazing day for America?  Oh, the longest day, they called it.  It was crazy.  People going to the beach and getting killed.  It was insane.  And, of course, made very famous in the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan, which, of course, starred Tom Hanks.  His son, Colin Hanks, is coming in later.  So we have a connection to Tom Hanks and D-Day today. 
[01:10:30]  I know, right?  Let's ask him about that.  Yeah.  Why wasn't he in it?  Yeah, what about...  It'd be like, can I be in every movie, Dad?  What the fuck?  Under pressure.  We've got to mention that if we're mentioning Bowie.  And then Queen sampled it, right?  And so did Villice.  I have no idea.  No, they didn't.  Who sampled it?  I'm going to get him as soon as he comes in.  I'm going to sit down.  I'm going to go, hey, Houston, we got a problem.  No, I wouldn't do that.  I'm going to go, hey, how's your Jenny doing? 
[01:11:00]  Wait, what did Vanilla Ice do with this song?  Did he just fucking ripped it off?  Ice Ice Baby.  No, Queen did it, yeah.  Queen did that with Bowie, the song.  Yeah.  Wait, now I'm all confused.  I'm all sorts of Queen doing it with Bowie.  Queen and Bowie do this.  And then Ice Ice Baby.  But then Ice Ice Baby, Vanilla Ice stole it.  But he insists it was different.  Do you ever hear him try to justify it?  Yeah, he said it on our show years ago.  It's like, no, it's...  And we just had to sit there dumbfounded. 
[01:11:30]  If you listen, it goes...  And mine goes...  It's like you did the same thing.  Vanilla Ice.  No, no, it's different, though.  It's different.  Vanilla Ice.  See?  It goes...  He added, like, one fucking little beat.  It's the same fucking thing.  See?  It's totally different. 
[01:12:00]  Oh.  Stop.  Collaborate and listen.  Oh, collaborate.  This is so bad.  This is on the radio, do you listen to it, though?  I would.  No.  If it's coming out of a meaty pussy, I don't even listen to it.  Let me hear a little.  Caress a speaker that booms.  I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom.  Deadly.  When I play a dope melody, anything less than the best is a felony.  Love it.  Oh.  But it's not a felony.  No, it's not.  His references stink. 
[01:12:30]  This is so embarrassing.  Why my DJ revolves it.  I sleep.  It's terrible references.  It's not a felony if your melody's not good.  And it's got the piano part in it.  Yeah, it's sampling.  Howie tried to deny that.  Besides, he admitted.  He said, look, we sampled shit.  Yeah.  We found good beats.  Uh-oh.  Do you want Vanilla Ice explaining?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, let's hear this.  Here, kill that for a second.  The bass is pumping.  Is it?  And his DJ earthquake.  It doesn't sound anything like under pressure. 
[01:13:00]  The only part that sounds like under pressure is the hook.  Oh.  Only the hook.  We sampled them from him, but it's not the same bass line.  Like it goes, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  That's the way theirs goes.  Ours goes, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  A little bitty chain.  It's not the same.  It's close enough.  Are you kidding me?  He's such a dick. 
[01:13:30]  it's a good video though remember his movie it's gonna be in the new adam sandler movie  and we got andy sandberg on friday promoting that new movie and they got the beat that i put in the  rap yeah party jam man oh yeah party jam man he is like you skunk thing but what if he were asked  to fork over royalties to the under pressure composers say through their attorneys would the  ice man comply of course oh gosh what a ice man remember calling people tools what a tool he is a 
[01:14:00]  tool what a tool uh he's on that list he's just a tool never went away though  never really went away well he was he was fucking huge for one song i know but it was he was everywhere  how great would that be if we were famous for one dumb four minute song great that would be a great 
[01:14:30]  life to have two other songs what were the other two there was uh sam's favorite go ninja go from  the teenage mutant ninja turtles movie and he covered play that funky music white boy yeah by uh who did  that originally wild cherry i was gonna come up with it you asshole that was me thinking yeah i had  cherry i was i was trying to remember the other part jubilee wild cherry you said yeah okay did you um  you didn't like the rhymes that you didn't like the references it was so melody it's a felony it would 
[01:15:00]  be a felony oh no it wouldn't yeah collaborate and listen collaborate and listen why collaborate and  exactly why would you stop collaborate and listen stop collaborate and listen was that just the right  amount of syllables yeah exactly stop carburetor and listen anything you said you don't think he  was a good mc well hideous a hideous mc there's nothing worse than old rap lyrics that don't hold

You could  Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it just kind of gets, it kind of goes on a little bit on a journey as opposed to just like, club music is just very sort of repetitive in the same couple words 
[01:25:00]  Right  This is a little bit more of like a journey  People would dance to that though, wouldn't they?  They wouldn't  Well, yeah, I mean, if the beat's good, people usually do it  It's just cool to listen to  It's really good  A number  That's a very good bass line  Oh, thanks, man  Yeah, cool  What are you promoting there, Troy Quant?

The show where nationally known comedians  Meet our panel  And try to decide  Should I suck a dick or not?  Today's guest  Joe DeRosa  I do a bit about this  About like the stair step up to it 
[01:27:30]  It's like it's not as easy  As would you just swallow the cum  There are many levels of things  You need to get through first  I might be fucking all in  I might want to go all the way  Here's the thing  Now what would you do with the dick?  That's the thing I don't know  That's what he hasn't really answered  I wouldn't be into swallowing any jizz  But still  That's the thing  Why are you making these rules?  Florentine's rules  Because it makes it more interesting  Florentine's rules  No  Yeah  No  I've had my own jizz on my face  What's the difference?  It's another man's  Wow  It looks like Joe DeRosa 
[01:28:00]  Is going to suck dick  That's all the time we have this week  Tune in next time  When Ricky Gervais tries to decide  That's not only a dick  That's the biggest dick in the world  Should I suck a dick  Or not?  Sirius XM  The Opie and Anthony Show  Why don't I welcome Tom Papa to the show?  Good morning 
[01:28:30]  It's been a few weeks, Mr. Papa  Always fun to have on board  Good to see you guys  What are you playing, Gotham?  Gotham, yeah, with Robert Kelly  It's for my sister's charity  What's her charity?  It's called City Green  Oh  She puts  She changes all these  Demolished areas and cities  Into gardens  Community gardens  I would support it  If she did the opposite  And cemented everything over  Yeah, exactly  Got rid of those little fruity trees  And put in some glass 
[01:29:00]  Fucking tires  Turned into a shooting range  So you've got a sister  That's like a do-gooder  Yeah  She created this charity  And just makes no money at it  And just helps people  It goes from what?  City to city?  Yeah  Latin, like Passaic, and Patterson  Huh  Like Robin Hood  Yeah  It really is  It's in everything green  No, it's Vixenhood  Oh, no  It is, though  It's making it nice  Okay, thanks, Chip  That's true, Chip  Yeah, I know  I like jovial, fun Chip  I like jovial Chip so much better 
[01:29:30]  Than me, Chip  Oh, than angry Chip  Yeah  Angry Chip  But he can't go off in a second  Yeah, now angry Chip's gonna make an appearance  Because he had to say it there, Tom  Thanks  I'm sorry  Tom was listening to the show on the way over  And listened to that nostalgia bit  We were kind of doing  Off a Funny or Die tweet that I saw yesterday  But you mentioned COD  Yeah, we were talking about COD  Cash on demand  On delivery  On delivery, right?  Or on demand  Delivery, yeah  On delivery  Cash on delivery  The mailman would come to your house  With whatever you ordered 
[01:30:00]  And he would give you the package  And you would have to pay him  And then somehow  It was supposed to get back  To the company you bought  The fucking shit from  You know, like TV  Would be like  Order no  And I don't  COD  The mailman had money on him?  I remember the term COD  I don't remember we ever actually did that  We have a package  It's COD, ma'am  COD  And he's standing there  With his hand out  And you had to give him  A little something too  You had to give him cash 
[01:30:30]  No one had credit cards then  Yeah  It was all cash  And then  Like you're giving money  To a fucking civil servant  That isn't making enough money  Right  Fuck it  Did it  Did it ever get back  To the company?  There's no way  And how?  Out of his balled up  Sweaty pocket  Yeah  2793  Made it back  Yeah  To the  Sony company  It was very shady  You think if he was hungry that day  He was going to be like  Well that's the COD money  Right  I don't know  I could get myself a slice of pizza 
[01:31:00]  Yeah  Maybe I could take a little off the top  Just a little bit  Yeah no one's going to notice  No you'd get the paperwork  You'd probably have to go back  With the fucking receipt  Like the boss  Or the guy  That posed up  Oh  Literal Jim  Oh  No  You're right though  I'm sure there was  A lot of paperwork  Involved with COD  I'm sure  I'm sure they set up the system  But something went drastically wrong  Because COD went away  There was a lot of ways  So I'm sure there were some problems  Absolutely  There had to be a ton of ways  To cheat back then  And I don't even know  When it was available 
[01:31:30]  Because for the most part  I just remember COD  Because I remember them saying  No COD  On the commercials  Right  It was like  Yeah  Check  Money order  Money order  Send your check on money order  No cash please  To  And no COD  My new order from the  Columbia Record Club is here  Yes  Oh my god  What a great scam those were  A penny and you get  Ten fucking records  You have to take  I still get them  Watch them  I was going to say  And they were like  Back in the day 
[01:32:00]  Yeah  There were albums  Full size fucking vinyl albums  This giant box would come to your house  Wait a ton  Did you ever mail stuff to somebody else?  No  I didn't either  Oh  What do you mean?  Did anyone actually pay for the Columbia?  No  It was stuff that  Yeah  Do the Columbia to your enemies?  Or maybe a magazine or something  And you kind of got home from school early that day  Oh and you'd take the shit?  And camped out  Yeah man  Oh get free shit  And you couldn't cancel  I've heard  I've heard  A little mail fraud 
[01:32:30]  You couldn't cancel  Because that shit couldn't come to your house  A little mail fraud  We weren't allowed to  Never heard of anyone  You couldn't cancel the Columbia house thing  I hated those fucks  All these shitty rotten CDs  And I'm glad they went out of business  What do you mean shitty CDs?  They had good ones  No no  But on a monthly basis  I could never find 10 I liked  Remember you got the form though  And you would check them off  Like ooh  That was cool  Ooh  Zeppelin 4  I'll take that one  I'm gonna get some Aureo Speedwagon  Oh  Oh Bob Seger  I'm gonna roll with the changes  Right 
[01:33:00]  And then  And then you're sitting there like going  Oh man  I gotta fucking take a Starland vocal band  There's nothing left here  Their selection stunk  It was terrible  And then they said they would send you another selection every month  That you could take or send back  And you would never send it back  But then you'd have to pay the normal price for it  Yeah  And the normal price was overinflated  And that's how they got away with the penny thing  Right  But no one ever  Hence  First of all you never sent them back  Secondly you never paid 
[01:33:30]  Hence  Having it mailed somewhere else  Ah  Clever  So I've heard  Clever  I'm not paying 15 bucks for seals and crops  Sealed and crops  And tied together  It was terrible  You can't offer people 30 records for a penny  And then wonder why they fuck you  Right  Everyone's gonna say that  Yeah  I'll take them for a penny  Well you fucked them before they fucked you though  That was the thing  Who's gonna get fucked here  Me or you  Who's getting fucked here  They would figure this out first  Threatening letters you started getting 
[01:34:00]  Yeah  You'd get like the letters like  You have  Perhaps  It's just  It slipped your mind  I like the one where they  I like that condescending shit  Uh  Maybe you just forgot  Or if you've sent  Please disregard this notice  Disregard it  Because then you don't even  Then this is stupid  And I apologize for even sending it  Right  But you probably didn't  You understood the tone though  Oh yeah  It was almost a shakedown  Like you better fucking pay soon  Is what I read  All those things 
[01:34:30]  Perhaps it slipped your mind  You owe us money  You'd meet with your other 12 year old lawyers at lunch  Are you getting this thing from Columbia  Yeah  Oh shit  Yeah yeah  You'd get together with your friends  Go over the legal documents  I would get yelled at for that shit  If my parents saw that I owed money  I would get fucking yelled at  Would you  Yeah  Yeah because I didn't pay my fucking bills  I'd be getting in trouble  You really thought you were gonna get in trouble  The biggest thing though  We were just denied at our house  That it was still coming  Like I don't know who did this  Dad I didn't do it 
[01:35:00]  Yeah  When you got together with the kid lawyers at the table though  The whole thing was  You're under 18  You can't sign a legal contract  That's right  Ah yes  Alright  Thank you  So it's okay  That was the workaround though  Yeah it was the workaround  Yeah you can't sign a legal  It's fucking rid of habeas corpus or something  But they're gonna know  I taped that penny to the thing  And sent it in aren't they  Yeah aren't they gonna  Yeah people would actually say like  Your fingerprint was on the tape  Like they're at Columbia House  It's CSI dusting the fucking tape 
[01:35:30]  That held the penny on for fingerprints  What a horrible business plan by Columbia  Them versus a nation of teenagers  Yes  You got a social security number  No  I changed the last number  You're good  I was thinking about that  Just that used to throw change into the toll booths around here  Yeah the big bags  Remember like throwing change  Remember that's not that long ago  I know  Clangity clang clangity  That's still a recent memory  Yeah like throwing change through the sunroof  Trying to get it into the basket 
[01:36:00]  Yeah got it  Yeah the trick was not to stop the vehicle  To be able to keep rolling  Throw the change  Have the gate go up  And you make it through  Florentine for years  Would drive through  And do the fake throw  And then keep going  It was so funny to watch him  Do the fake throw  Or sometimes he would open the door  And fucking pick up  And fake throw  And pretend he dropped it  And then open the door  And just pick up  Fucking 30 cents off the ground  That people had missed  Yeah yeah  I think Florentine fucked the parkway  Out of 2 million dollars 
[01:36:30]  And that was before  They could catch you  With that camera shit  Yeah  You know what they were going to do  We're after you  But 35 cents  Occasionally he goes  Even if I got a ticket  I still am way ahead  Yeah yeah  I'm way ahead  That was his thing  The scary part though  Was driving through  And then the alarm  And then the alarm  You thought some car  Was going to come out  And follow you  Right  You didn't pay alarm  What was that supposed to do  I was supposed to shake you up  And make you go  Yeah but the budget  Would only go off  After you had already committed  So what's the difference  To turn in front of cars  And for you in the future  Your best pay  Oh okay yeah 
[01:37:00]  Maybe for you in the future  Your best pay motherfucker  Yeah  And you do like  Big acting in the car  Like  Yeah  Start getting angry  You're like  The gate  The gate  Jim's awful  Fucking fake throw  Fake throw  I don't know what happened  Yeah  I throw it  I don't know  It said go  And the good old days  Around the 4th of July  Maybe it's jammed  Throw firecrackers in there  And stuff  Throw firecrackers  Yeah  Throw firecrackers  Not even me  My father and his friends  When I was driving  Like I would be driving  With them in the backseat 
[01:37:30]  As a kid  And they would just be laughing  Throwing like ash cans  Into the fucking thing  Boom  This guy said he used to  Block the toll collector  What?  Think about it  If it's an out of  Out of the way one  You can make some cash  Ed what do you got on this?  Actually it was the homies  Down in Irvington, New Jersey  Used to put like shirts down  Those toll collector things  And then people  Talked to change in  And it would collect  And then they'd come keep it  What a genius idea  Yeah you could get  You could get some quick change  Just circle back 
[01:38:00]  And then take your shirt out  So it works again  So no one's on to you  What about the toll collectors though?  They gotta be Johnny on the spot  No some of these  Some of these toll boots  Had nobody working there  Yeah nobody  Those out of the way weird ones  Yeah and at night  Yeah man  You'd fucking jam it up for an hour  There'd be one fat girl  In the one full service one  You know she's not getting out  I haven't had to deal  With a toll collector  In so long  So long  If you don't have easy pass  I really believe  They should just fucking  Steer your car off to the right  And it's a cliff  Yeah  And you fucking plummet 
[01:38:30]  Yes  It seems like that's  Finally turning around  It seems like  Most people have easy pass  Or more have it than don't  I take that midtown tunnel every day  When I come out  It's like  The cash lane fucks everyone up  It fucks everyone  Exactly  Scumbags  It's the worst fucking thing  Just get it  What are you a mobster  You don't want people tracking you  Right  Stop it  There's no way to cheat anymore  No  In anything  It's like even like  You know  Cheating was fun  Electronics have  Electronics  Yeah  Cameras 
[01:39:00]  It felt like you were getting away  Scanning  Well you were  Yeah everything's scanned  And fucking  There's no just COD money  In your pocket  COD  Oh that shit  And a box of records  Yeah  A box of fucking records  We used to figure out  How to get free soda  I thought it was the greatest thing ever  How'd you do that  With the fake  With the fake  Well I had a really thin  Fucking arm back then  So I was the guy  Oh really  And I had scrapes up and down my arms  We figured out one day  You go in  And you had to like  You had to cut the corner  And then  I got so good 
[01:39:30]  That I could even get you your soda  Which one you wanted  I had all the buttons on the inside  That was like  They would line up after  Basketball practice  And soda was what  A quarterback then  But it was just so cool  You could do it for free  Yeah to you  That was like winning  Like in Vegas  That was like a score  Fuck yeah  You got a free soda  You can't do that anymore  It's huge  Stealing is fun  I loved it  Everyone loves to steal  So much fun  It rules  It really does  I was stealing rules  You know when I'm using like  Celebrities like  Why is she shoplifting  Because it's a blast 
[01:40:00]  Because it's a ball stupid  It really is  I'm trying to  I would love to see  The old machine  That I used to do it  With  Because it was  It was cool  You had to get way down low  Yeah  Get that arm in there  You can't do it now  You were scared  Because you felt like  You were either  Going to get electrocuted  Or stuck  Because there were wires in there  I don't even know  How we figured it out  But we did  Now with clothes even  You can't  Because of those  Fucking magnetic things  I bought a t-shirt recently  A good one  And a fucking dumb cunt  Forgot to take the thing  And of course  I went off going 
[01:40:30]  But I ignored it  And I get home  And I realize  I still got that fucking tag  Oh you can't ignore it  Because now you try to take it off  And it puts ink on it  How do I get that off?  Explodes paint  So you really did steal the shirt  No I didn't  Why wouldn't you go back to the store?  Because it was in  Oh is it another city  Yeah man  It might have been LA  You need really strong magnets  Yeah  Really?  Yeah that takes  I don't have  Who the fuck has strong magnets?  Is that all that is?  Yeah  No come on  There's more to it than that  That one with  Like the plastic one 
[01:41:00]  With the little nub on the end  It's a magnet  They slide it over a magnet  At the counter  How strong of a magnet?  Really strong  Oh crazy  Like the ones that pick up  The cause at the junkyard  So wouldn't it be worth  Who the fuck has that run out of the house?  So wouldn't it be worth  Getting a real strong magnet?  It must beat portable magnets  There's gotta be something else  If you steal a lot  Besides that  Something  I don't know  That's it  It's a magnet  It's a really strong magnet  That's why  Because I bought something up  From some army navy store  And the same thing  I brought a hat 
[01:41:30]  Some boots  With waffle  Fucking  Waffling  You bought a hat?  I bought a hat  For a gift  Oh  One of those ear flap ones  Oh my god  For who?  What 90 year old birthday party  Were you going to?  It was for my nephew  He's in college  And you had the tag on it?  You had the tag on it  And the guy said  Well if you have a really strong magnet  That'll take it off  Did it?  And we had a really strong magnet  From the museum  That sounds like such a name  The Papa's a dork  Museum of Natural History  We had 
[01:42:00]  We had really strong magnets  The ones that you buy  And they're like  Yeah you can use these  They're dangerous  But keep them away  From everything in your house  Yes  Keep it away from your TV  Do you want to be sure  It's not near your computer?  They use those on like  Rare earth magnets  Yeah  Yeah  Rare earth magnets  It worked  So you could do my t-shirt  I could  No no no  Fucking side business  Cause you could  Pinch your fucking hands  Between like the magnet  And metal  And it will like  Fuck your hand up 
[01:42:30]  Yeah  Like it's that strong  Where it'll  Squish your fucking finger  Could you  If I saw this shirt  You could help me with?  Yes  Alright  If I could find the magnet  It's a great team  Where would you leave?  I hope you put them  Run into your fucking hard drive  I could probably have them under  Why don't you wear it as is?  Nah  Cause that thing  Start a trend  Yeah start a trend  You can start a trend  Yeah  We got a guy that says  That they're still jamming the tolls  We got another guy  That used 15 aliases  For Columbia Music House  What a genius is to jam the tolls man  Poverty breeds brilliance sometimes  It really does  Well remember

[01:45:30]  Yeah yeah  You could really just  With clever scams  You could figure stuff out  My brother got to a point  Where his license  Was so suspended  So suspended  He couldn't possibly  Register a vehicle  So he drew  A New York State  Registration  And inspection sticker  Drew it by hand  With a ruler  And fucking  Red blue pens  And stuff  And just drew it  Did it look good?  And taped it  Into the windshield 
[01:46:00]  Did it look good?  That's hilarious  Yeah it looked good enough  Where  No one's gonna stop you  A cop isn't gonna stop him  I mean if a cop did stop  And then looked at it  He'd know  But it was just  You know when you drive  Passed the cop  It's all up to date  He's legal  There he is  Yeah  Let's go to the magnet guy  Yeah  Brian in Connecticut  Brian  Hey  Yeah  Those magnets  That are just in there  We figured this out  One day  Completely by accident  Actually  But  We  If you take  Like an old computer's  Hard drive 
[01:46:30]  The magnets in there  They get the plates  To spin  In the old computer  Hard drive  They're reverse polarity  Magnets  They're the same magnets  That they use  In those devices  The magnets are no bigger  Than your thumbnail  And if you go on  Amazon.com  They're like  A buck for like  Eight of them  You only need one of them  That slides those little  Things right up  So there's gotta be  Guys doing this  All the time in stores  It probably is  Reverse polarity  It's called  Stealing though  No I understand  But I didn't realize  It was that easy  That's a great movie  Named reverse polarity 
[01:47:00]  Oh  It's about a magnet salesman  Yes  And Sandra Bullock  Whisks into his life  Two opposites  But they attract  Yes  Reverse polarity  On the movie poster  They're back to back  Looking over their shoulder  Ah you attract me  She's a positive  He's a negative  But then they get there  And you realize  That she's like a police  She's a police detective  Investigating a child murder  And she finds  Little bloody shoes  In his closet  But falls in love  With them anyway 
[01:47:30]  Reverse polarity  And then he fucks her  With a big horseshoe magnet  And a pussy and asshole  Classic  I think I've seen that movie  Yeah  I know people have scams  All the time  But I didn't realize  This one was so easy  Is what I'm saying  I know  Yeah  You wanna know  How to get that thing off Jimmy  I do  It's driving me crazy  Cause it's my  It's a good James Pierce t-shirt  James Pierce  Like I'm wearing right now  Fuck it off  Fuck a shirt  Scott in New York 
[01:48:00]  What's up Scott  Hey guys  Hey I've had to remove  A couple of these  From my wife  You know  People forgot to take them  Yeah she's an idiot  If you wrap  The plastic device  That's full of ink  With tape  Like electrical tape  Duct tape  And you use a pair  Of side cutters  You can work away  At the little piece of metal  That actually pierces  The clothing  And you can snip it  And as long as you have it  Wrapped tight with the tape  The ink's not gonna come out  Wait  Who the fuck wants  To duct tape and wrap 
[01:48:30]  For that  For a t-shirt  Sounds crazy  I don't have one of  Betsy Ross's original flags  In my house  It's a fucking t-shirt  I'm not going  Wrapping duct tape around it  Like it's a gerbil  I'm gonna fuck  Jesus how much work  Thank you anyway  I like the magnet ideas  I have to buy tools  I'd rather go to the fucking museum  And go where's your magnets  Assholes  Fucking bring my shirt  Into the museum  Look at a magnet  Pop it off  And go I hate this thing  And leave  This guy's talking  Side cutters  Exactly  I'm wrapping things up 
[01:49:00]  I'm gonna get my fucking tools  All you gotta do  Is buy a plane ticket  And go out there  And return it  Thanks  I'll be down there  With my tools  Want a Home Depot scam?  Yes  Alright  Jeff in Jersey  Jeff  Hey what's up guys  Hey man  I remember one of  I've been listening to you guys  15 years  I actually remember  One of old Dirty's  Scams  He would go to Home Depot  Load up a cart  Full of stuff  For a job  Take it out to his  Buy it  Take it out to his car  Load up his car  Then go back 
[01:49:30]  Into Home Depot  With the same cart  Recreate his receipt  You know  And then return  All the stuff  He already had  In his car  Saying the job  Got cancelled  But he  Basically stole everything  He just bought  He got everything  You know  For free  Oh I got it  Load it up in his car  Then go back in  Cherry pick the stuff  Off the shelves  And return it  And go up  With the  That's great  That's before  All the security cameras  That's a receipt scam  That happens a lot  Usually at like  Lower levels  You think it's still 
[01:50:00]  Happening a lot  Yeah  If I was a homeless guy  I would just hang out  Like around Dwayne Reed's  All day  And wait for people  To throw their receipts  Hurry  Take their receipt  Go back into the store  Find what was on the receipt  And return it  We can still get away  With some stuff  Yeah a few things  I like that  Let me check the security camera  I don't see you purchasing this  Yeah but who's going to go that far  For four dollars  I know  That's true  You want to know how to get free groceries  At Stop and Shop  Oh how you do that  Melanie's going to tell us  My friend Marvin used to say  Stop and Plop  And I'd crack up 
[01:50:30]  Every time  I miss Marvin  Me too  I love Marvin  I don't even know Marvin  But Stop and Plop  I feel like I know  That's ridiculous  All the stories you tell  Melanie what do you got  Hey yeah  Brand new pair of roller skates  Start over  Sorry  At Stop and Shop  Now they have these scanners  That you walk around  You scan your groceries  And at the end  When you get to the register  You just scan the scanner  On something  And it totals up your bill  So you can walk around 
[01:51:00]  Scan something for like a dollar  And then not scan  The rest of your groceries  With the self-service  They have no clue  Oh so you don't scan  All the items  The honor system  But self-checkout  Everything's weighted  Well yeah  But also  They usually have like  One hall monitor  That kind of oversees  All the self-checkout  But you can turn off  The  You can turn off  The bag item  There's a bag 
[01:51:30]  There's a thing  Like in CVS  Where you have to bag your items  If you don't put it  It goes  Please place your item  In the bag  It gets all panicky  It rats you  It rats you out loudly  Oh I know  Really loud  I don't want to bag  Iraq sir  Iraq  You bag it in your cart  As you go  So you never have to weigh it  You just scan the gun  To the machine  And swipe your card  And that's it  You would think  They would make you  Weigh the whole shopping cart  By the end  I think so right  That's like a truck stop  Who needs that  Fucking cart  Yeah  I don't know  That sounds easy 
[01:52:00]  To fucking  But you could turn  You could turn off  The bag item  Like your own  Where you have to  Bag your thing  And then it won't  Probably bark at you  Yeah  Let's go to John  New Hampshire  John  Hey how's it going guys  Hey Chad  Hey I was going to say  Back in the day  I used to work  At a clothing store  At the mall  And people used to come in  With those oversized  Shopping bags  And what they would do  Is they'd line them  Like heavily line them  With tin foil  And then put white  Contact paper over it 
[01:52:30]  So when they put  The clothes in  It would deflect  Those tags  How does that work  Wait  Contact paper over where  I'm losing  You have me  It's  They would line  The inside of the bag  With tin foil  With tin foil  Okay  And then put contact paper  Over it  So the inside of the bag  Looked white  Oh  It looked like the bag still  But it had tin foil  Tin foil  Yeah  And then you  Fill it with potatoes  And put it on the grill  Right  What the fuck 
[01:53:00]  God  We missed out  On some good scams  It's funny  There's like a fine line  Between something  Kind of clever  Like  The Florentine  Fake throw  Right  To like  Changing bags  Yeah now you're  Stealing shit  Stealing shit  From major stores  Yeah  Some of these  Are so obvious  Wait till you hear  This one  Kevin in Jersey  Kevin  Hey  I used to work  At a movie theater  In  It's one of those  It's now like the  Cinema 6's 
[01:53:30]  In New York  Proud of you  New York  Hello  Yeah  At the radio show  We  We had  We used to  We used to have  Camp shows for kids  Where they'd buy  Thousands of cups  Of soda  And we would  Resell the cups  Because that's how  They kept track  Of how much profit  They were supposed to have  At the end of the day  So we would clean up  The cups from the movie theater  From these little  Snotty kids  And resell them to the public  And pocket the money  It was thousands of dollars  That's brilliant  What  You'd resell cups  Used cups  That's brilliant 
[01:54:00]  That's how they knew  How much product  They gave away  This was like an old  Family movie  That's fucking brilliant  But didn't they notice  That the soda  Was going away  And it didn't match up  To the amount of cups  That's smart though  You could have just  Hit him then  And took his wallet  You just restack the cups  Now it's Scooby-Doo  Old man Johnson  He'll never know  And you don't punch it 
[01:54:30]  Into the register  Obviously  Exactly  Right on  We used to bust  In all these kids  From their housing projects  And there'd be  Thousands and thousands  Of dollars in cups  And we just  Split it four ways  We're 15 years old  With three grand  In our pockets  After a weekend  Summer show  Whatever works  Alright thank you Kevin  Let's go to Billy in New York  Billy  Yeah I used to  Wrap the security tags  In a condom  And just smash  What happened  And all the ink  Would just spray  Into the condom 
[01:55:00]  All the ink  Is that what you call it  Wait you would  What  Why didn't we think of that  What would he do  He'd put the security thing  Wrapping it in a condom  Where did the ink  Come from  Inside  It's inside a little  When you try to smash it open  Glass tube  Yeah  Yeah when you try to open it  Without the magnets  He gets all over the clothes  And ruins them  Oh  So you just try to get  A magnet around it  What's a condom  I mean a condom around it  Yeah exactly  I would probably just  Throw the wrapper on it  And do it wrong  How do you steal the condom  Break it on some girl's back  We got a guy from 
[01:55:30]  Morgan Stanley  He wants to  Oh boy  He's got a good scam  I can imagine  Hold on  Let's go to gas station  Bob first  Bob  Connecticut  Yeah I used to work  At a gas station  And we'd check the oil  We'd pull out the dipstick  And then push the oil  Down on the dipstick  Show the customer  That he was a quart low  We'd take an empty can of oil  From the shelf  Pour it in  And then pour it in  That's funny  That old gag  That old gag 
[01:56:00]  That rules  Sorry ma'am  You're mighty low  You know some of this  Shit happened to us  But I don't care  That rules  That is a good one  So many ways to steal  Yeah  You want the Morgan Stanley guy  Adam McQueen's  Adam  Hey what's up guys  Hey  So you sell people  Facebook stock  At $38 a share  Then  You short it  I've always made the mistake  In my life  Kind of leading a semi 
[01:56:30]  On its life  Every now and then  I get away with a few bucks  I thought I'd make out  I was like oh yeah  I did great  Back in the day  About 10 years ago  When the 900 numbers came out  Yeah  We found out what these guys did  They were walking around  Midtown Manhattan  They got a couple of  FedEx and UPS outfits  They would put addresses on it  Like oh you know  I'm going to 757th Avenue  10th floor John Smith right  They'd walk up  They'd go up to the front desk  Front desk would be like  Oh there's no John Smith here  These guys would be like  Oh can I just borrow your phone  They'd pick up the phone  They'd dial these 900 numbers  You know they had to wait 14 seconds 
[01:57:00]  Or you know the whole  If you don't hang up now  You'll be billed $100  Yeah  They'd hang on the 15 seconds  100 bucks  There's no answer  Hang up the phone  Pick up call again  They would do it 2-3 times  From every building  They'd literally go door  But what was in it for them?  Were they hooked up  With the 900 guys?  They were hooked up  With the 900  Oh okay  That's pretty good  Right  Turns out these 900 numbers  The phone company  Pays them every night  But you don't get  Your phone bill  For like what?  For like a month  Month and a half  Yeah  Big corporations 
[01:57:30]  Figured out they were  Getting ripped off  They figured these guys  Walked away with about  21 million bucks  Wow  One guy made a lot of calls  Yeah right  Well they don't know  How many guys it was  Nobody keeps their tapes  For like 2 months  By the time the guy  Doing the records  Like oh yeah  You know we got like  $700 worth of phone calls  But it was thousands  And thousands of places  All over the city  Wow fucking security guys  Are being fired  Yeah they traced the money  Back to the Caymans  And that was it  These guys just took  Their money out  They did it for a month  And vanished with all the money 
[01:58:00]  Wow  That is genius  Right  Six years ago  The only other thing  I thought was just as good  Because they stuck it  To the government  A couple of guys  Transformed a corporation  Out in Vegas  Right  They were in business  Like a year  Ten years  They took all of the money  Right  And they bought  Gold and silver coins  They bought them  You know whatever  The gold and silver was  $1,200 an ounce  Back in the day  They bankrupt the company  They divvied up  All the coins  Amongst themselves  As pay  Back in 
[01:58:30]  I don't even know  What it was  But at some point  You know gold and silver  Became more valuable  Than the dollar coins  And the nickels  And the dimes  They printed it on  So what happened  Was the mafia  Went ahead  They collected up  All these like silver coins  They would melt it down  So the government decided  Oh we can't have them  Doing that  We're going to make  Some amendments  And we're going to say  That the government  Won't recognize  Intrinsic value of coins  That paper money  Will always be the same  You can never have a dime  No matter what it's made of  The government recognizes  That as 10 cents  No matter what  So these guys 
[01:59:00]  Got a hold of that  And they said  Okay that's fine  They divvied up  Like 12 or 13 million dollars  Worth of gold and silver coins  Among the employees  These guys went  And did their taxes  That year  And instead of doing  The value of the  Coins  They added up  They're like  Oh you know  I got like  $6,000 worth of gold coins  Based on face value  The IRS goes after them  Like no no no  You don't have $6,000 worth of coins  You guys had $14 million worth of coins  Look in court  Over 150 charges filed against them 
[01:59:30]  They actually tried these people twice  All charges dismissed  Because they went in  And the lawyer's like  Look you can't have it both ways  They said  Either you're recognizing  The coins is more valuable  Than pay for money  Or you're not  What genius  Hold on  Just to interrupt  What genius  So basically  They bought up all these  Let's just say  They bought dimes  For the sake of argument  And let's say  Silver and gold wise  Or whatever  Silver wise  The dime was actually worth  $2 because of the  Silver  Silver  They were fucking 
[02:00:00]  Paying each other with it  And just declaring it  As a dime  And because the rule says  It has to be recognized  Face value  They didn't have to write it off  As having that kind of money  That's genius  It kills me  That there are people out there  With these great things  And you know  What do we do  Working for a living  It's heartbreaking  Well you know what  Half those guys  The genius of doing that  They actually do  Doing productive stuff  For society too  Half of them become crooks  And the other half  Fucking you know  Try to cure cancer  An age  That is a smart

[02:08:30]  And she and her  A couple of her friends  Figured out that  Each roll of each game  Had X amount of dollars  And winnings on it  And they figured out  A little code  To keep marked  On this board  Back by  Well by the cigarettes  So that  They knew how much money  Had been won  Off each roll  So if a roll  Got down to  50 tickets left  And they knew  There was still  $750 worth of winnings  On that roll 
[02:09:00]  They would buy the roll  Buy the rest of the roll  And you know  You got a winner on there  What?  Oh man  Wait  We did that for years  How many would be in the roll?  It depends on the game  Some of the games  Had thousands of dollars  Although most of it  Would be going  Wait  They already knew  How much each roll  Would  I guess  Take in?  Yeah  They figured it out  You know  Holy fuck  So then you're just  Constantly checking  Alright  Look at that

[02:10:00]  A certain point  Whoever sold  The next ticket  Knew  We got to buy the roll  Wow  Why wouldn't they  Just tell them  Hey it's time  To buy the roll  Yeah  Because it worked  Over different shifts  You know  They'd have to pass it  From shift to shift  Wow  Everyone can find  A pattern  And a little scam  Yeah  It's great  My friend did something  On a game called  What was that game?

[02:20:30]  Well I mean you guys are great  First of all  Good morning  I'm pretty much calling  I grew up in New York  And the Red Lobster Dollars  Is pretty much just the last of my hustles  When I was younger  I used to work as a waiter  For different chain restaurants and stuff  And apparently a lot of customers  Would forget their credit cards  And you would know  You had at least 24 hours  Before they would realize  And call it in stolen and such  So the very next morning  I would go  I had very  I had a lot of friends 
[02:21:00]  That were bartenders  Who worked at these chain restaurants  Like Chili's  And Red Lobster  And shit like that  You go in  You buy the Chili or Red Lobster Dollars  And then later on that night  You pretty much go right back to your homeboy  Who's a bartender  And exchange him for regular dollars  He winds up giving an enormous tip  And we wind up walking out with cash  Oh it's kind of like laundering the credit card cash there  Yeah  Bingo  And other stories  Man  Do you remember when there was a wall-bound supermarket  When I was a kid 
[02:21:30]  I used to walk in with my older brother  And all it took was taking a big fat pinch of wall-bound shopping bags  Going up and down the aisles  Filling them up  And you would just walk right out  All right  No creativity whatsoever  Right  There's nothing adorable about that  That's just stealing shit and walking out the door with it  That's because you've got a gun  And if you have to you'll shoot your way out  Yeah  Another one is my brother at a young age  He had kids 
[02:22:00]  And nobody ever suspects your kids of stealing  We would walk into Macy's  The kids would just grab whatever they wanted  Little starter jackets  Little starter hats  And walk right out  Oh that's good  Terrible  That's great  By the time we would catch him outside the store  What are we going to do?  We're not going to walk the shit back here  Of course not  We'd line their diapers with cocaine  And we'd go to the airport  Yes and Lois wouldn't fly without her fucking lucky hat  Dumb hat  This is all good but we need Christmas-like guy  We can't move on until Christmas-like guy calls back 
[02:22:30]  Thank you very much guys  You guys are great  All right  Pizza delivery scam  Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum  So as Christmas-like guy calls  Get him right through  Let's say hi to Tony in New Jersey  Hey Tony  Hey guys  Hey I used to work for a pizza delivery group  And what we did is  We took the coupons that were supposed to be on the box  And we'd bring it to the house  Deliver the pizza  Not give the person the coupon  They'd pay us 
[02:23:00]  If it was five dollars off a large cheese  We'd turn the coupon in  And pocket the five bucks  Oh there you go  The people never asked  They never asked for the coupon?  I would ask for it  You wouldn't ask for a coupon  You wouldn't ask for a coupon  You're trying to scam me  Yeah  I already got fucked by some guy with Christmas lights last week  I don't need you fucking me over now  He said he was coming back to replace these lights  He never came by  Thanks guys  Punching out  Another lottery scam  This is big time shit  A lot  Dave what up 
[02:23:30]  Hey guys  Down here in Philly  The Center City newsstands  You know the type of people that run them  They would go through the whole roll of lottery tickets  And the way PA used to have them  Is anything you would win would be in a parentheses at the bottom of the ticket  They would take a needle and a magnifying glass  They'd put a real thin line and look for the parentheses for the winning ticket  Pull it up and tell everybody back to losers  Wait what?  I don't understand it 
[02:24:00]  He'd be able to make a slight little slit with a pinhead  In the foil shit that you scrape off  And know that if he sees a black line somewhere in there  He knows it's a parentheses of a winning ticket  Oh fuck  And no one else would notice that  With a magnifying glassy look  Oh clever  See there'd be a black little line where there wasn't on the losing tickets  I would gather  That's what he said  Can you still do that?  Dun dun dun dun dun dun  No they moved it around 
[02:24:30]  They moved the winning amount into the play field now  So you can't do that anymore  That means there's some rats that told some people  Fucking rats  Fucking rat  Whole family fucking rats  I'm stalling because I want Christmas lights guys  I don't think Christmas lights guys are going to call back  Bastard  What are you looking at?

[02:31:00]  No  I wasn't really trying  That's not going to get you out of it  Are you kidding me  Hold on  I was just talking  I was just fooling around a little bit  We give out an award every year  For worst attempt at keeping bit going  Oh no  Oh that bad  It felt like the people  Like we needed help  It was a fucking  It was  It was  It was  It was  It was  It was three balls  No strikes  And Tom took a little  Fucking swing  At an outside pitch  And bounced it off his foot  And was tagged out  It was really awful

[02:32:00]  Guys  Run with it  That's all right  I like it  I went  I went  I went  I went  I went to the moves  With Roland  Also  Now you know  How Roland is  I bet he's  Moving on to Halloween  These screenings  Oh Jesus  Sorry  No it's okay  That's all I got  Did he  Did he fall asleep  No he didn't fall asleep  That means he's healthier  That's good  But he was  Saving seats 
[02:32:30]  I've never seen it  Done better than Roland  He's amazing  He does not  Give a flying fuck  Who you are  Who wants to come  Into that row  He's like  No  No he's taken  They're getting popcorn  And then they're like  No all of them  He goes  Yeah all of them  They're taken  Taken  He gets all belligerent  With people  It's great  People just kept trying  To make their way in  Because they're like  Oh I see  So they go to  Scoot past some of the people  He's like  Taken  Taken  And then in  Earshot of the people  He just told 
[02:33:00]  That they were  At the concession stand  He goes  They're in the bathroom  So he's not even  Keeping the same story  That other people  Like if I was the guy  That was told  They were in the concession  I'd turn around  And go  You say they're in concession  No but the best part  Is you say they're in concession  And they walk in  With their jackets on  And no fucking candy  Yeah no candy  Anything  He's given up to be a liar  Well the best part  Of the whole scam  Is the movie starts  And he has an empty seat  Right next to him  Oh yeah  Because he never fills it  With anybody  Oh he fills it though  Popcorn  Soda  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Fucking seat was packed 
[02:33:30]  But you think he's saving it  For like people  No he just wants room  He wants room  And then the people  He said no to  Are literally like  You know the next row over  He did sit down  And he moved his arms  Like ah  He literally  Showed me  How much room he has  Ah  Ah  He did this at another  Movie screening  Where the people  Were standing against  The wall  Because there was  No seats  And Roland has  Four empty seats  Next to him  The lights go down  And the movie's starting  He starts howling  Laughing really loud 
[02:34:00]  Because the people  Are right next to him  Ah  Roland you got  Some set of balls  Man  Yeah people  Because I like  To have my space  Yes you do  And then I got there early  So when people go  Hey somebody's sitting there  I go yeah  Move on  And he does  He goes  No no no  He goes  That's it  And some other guys  Like he was looking  After Roland told him  That the seats were taken  And he's looking  And Roland literally  Looks at him  And he just goes  No no  They're taken  Go  Ain't gonna happen  Go  Ain't gonna happen  Ain't gonna happen 
[02:34:30]  Ain't gonna happen  You don't care if they're upset  Fuck them  And then the guy  Right from the lights  Right now  He goes  Has anybody seen there  I go yeah  And then they keep on walking  And the  Now we went to go see  Prometheus  A little screening  A very anticipated  Motion picture  By the way  Very highly anticipated  Who's in this thing  Motion picture  Charlize Thrawn  Michael Thassard  Is in it  Yes  Were you in a tuxedo  No  No  It wasn't a premiere  It was a screening 
[02:35:00]  Oh  So  We go in  And now  High security there  They don't want you  Going in with your  Fucking cell phones  So you have to  Take your cell phone  Oh you gotta check  Your cell phone  That's really rare  They put it in a plastic bag  A dumb bag  With a ticket  Rip off the other half  Of the ticket  And give it to you  I would never do that  And well I didn't  I went into the bathroom  And stuck it in my sock  And then walked back out  Did they search you  When you're going in  Well they wand you  But it must not 
[02:35:30]  Have worked very well  Because I had a  Heckler and cot  Forty caliber sidearm  On my hip  And it didn't even  Pick that up  Come on  It's like  Really  Come on  They wanded me  Those wands are fake  That's what I'm thinking  It's a fake fucking wand  It's a facade  It didn't pick up my gun  Maybe it was set to bone  Yeah exactly  What if it's not looking  For metal  It's probably looking  For some other  Kind of transmission device  I don't know  It's just  It was one of those  Regular metal wand 
[02:36:00]  Things that they had going  And yeah  It didn't pick up anything  It's like really  Didn't pick that up  Wow  I don't think it's  Going to pick up  A phone then  And yeah  But Roland also  Didn't check it  He just left it  In his pocket  Yeah  And the wand  Didn't pick that up  Either  This wand's a real  Comedy of errors  Yes it really was  Jeff  A comedy of errors  How was the movie  Let me tell you  Prometheus  I won't  No spoilers 
[02:36:30]  Don't worry  Don't you fret  Yes you're not lying  You're Prometheus  No  It's by the alien guy  Right  Yes  Ridley Scott directed it  It looks fucking amazing  The look of the movie  I saw it in the IMAX 3D  And the scenes of Prometheus  The ship  Yeah  The landing sequence  Is like kind of the  Kind of akin to the  Nostroma landing  An alien sequence  But done  Like unbelievably better  Wow  Fuck it 
[02:37:00]  It looks great  Ridley Scott  Did an amazing job  Cinematographer  Amazing  The writing  Ah  Ah  Not so much  The story  Berg  What was some of the writing  Well it was a little  Too fucking  Some of the shit  Was  And it's  It's a space alien  Type movie  Yet some of the shit  You just look at it  And go  I can't believe that  Really  On a human level  I can't believe  That that woman  Went through that 
[02:37:30]  And is doing this  Right  Like that kind of thing  People that aren't  Qualified for certain things  All of a sudden  Completely qualified  To do certain things  Oh  Yeah  There's  Suspension to disbelief  Is one thing  But this took it  To a whole nother level  Great  Yeah  I was a little  Disappointed with that  Storyline  The fact that they  I guess it started out  When they  First got the idea  That it was going to be  An alien prequel  Then they decided  To make it kind of 
[02:38:00]  A standalone movie  Then they decided  Why don't we just do both  And in doing both  It kind of takes away  From both storylines  So it's kind of  Attached to alien  A little bit  Oh it's definitely  Attached to alien  There are some scenes  That if you're a fan  Of alien  It's very cool to see  Right  Like you're like  Oh fuck  That's cool  That's that  You know  This is this  From the original  Alien movie  But in trying to do both  They made both  The stories  Kind of just  So many ragged 
[02:38:30]  Loose ends  So many unexplained  Things  So many scenes  That you're like  Why was that  Even in the fucking movie  Like just  Weirdness  Where you know  The movie ends  And you're like  I remember that scene  They didn't fool me  I didn't forget it  I didn't forget  That that was in the movie  I have no idea  Why it was in the movie  And it does look like  They were lining up  For a couple of sequels  There  But like  A lot of questions  You're just like  Why  Why that 
[02:39:00]  So how many apples  Do you give it  Well  I  Let me  How many  Chestbursters  Do I give it  No I  It's getting good reviews  Well  Rotten Tomatoes  Is up to what  Danny just had it up  76% by the reviewers  Yeah  97%  I read some of the  People's  Reviews  And a lot of  What they were saying  Made a lot of sense  You want  You go in there  As a fan  Wanting to like it 
[02:39:30]  So you're almost  It almost feels bad  To say like  I didn't like it  As much as I wanted to  You were hoping to  I was hoping to  Fucking just love it  And like I said  Visually  It's fucking  Amazing  It looks great  The 3D  Is done so well  It's not this  Oh it's a 3D movie  Yeah  But it's not  In your face  3D  It's  It's  It's very subtle  3D  It's very immersive  You feel like  You're in that  Fucking movie  That's why  It looks  It looks good 
[02:40:00]  I might go  Just to see it  For the 3D  Is it going to be  On the IMAX  Yeah  3D rules  Yeah  That's what we saw  It just looks  So good  I like the 3D  But the  Colin Hanks is here  The writing  Where is he  Bring him in  Tom can we  Throw you there  And put Tom here  Oh  Tom for Tom  We're switching Tom for  So out of 5 stars  What would you give it  It was very hard  I would say out of 10  You love your movies  Let me give it out of 10  Out of 10  I'm going to give it  You're going to go 7  I was going to give it 
[02:40:30]  Yeah  A 7  Right at 7  Because I'm a  And this is because  I'm a fan  And because it just  Visually was amazing  And one of the characters  The android character  Is very good  But everyone else  Kind of doesn't  Like Charlize Theron's character  She really doesn't  Even have a reason  To be there  Really  It's like  Just hot  Fuck  We'll say something  About the  Weyland Corporation  From the movie  They show no  How to dress  Their women 
[02:41:00]  Very tight  Fitting  Jumpsuits  And her  Ass is exquisite  How's the pussy  Bulge in 3D  Yeah  Yes  There's a great scene  Where you do see  Charlize Camel toe  Really  Yes  Yes  And they did that  Just for the 3D  Yeah it was nice  And the other girl  That is kind of the lead  Kind of the  You know  Save the whole thing  Kind of Ripley type thing  Yeah  She looked really hot  When she was just in 
[02:41:30]  Some kind of  Little underwear thing  And braw-y  Kind of top thing  Wrapped up  And covered in blood  She  Yeah  She looked really  Really hot too  She had like a nice ass  Nice ass on her  What do we got here  Yes  Yes  Yes  But  I don't know  Colin Hanks  Oh is he out there  No  Yeah so I wasn't  I was a little  Disappointed  I will watch it again  Because I want to see 
[02:42:00]  I want to see if I missed something  Maybe  Maybe I was an idiot  Right  Maybe I had  Raised expectations  She's a fat pussy  I love her  Yeah  You'll love it  What is this  Dr. Steve  Who's Colin Hanks  He looks exactly the same  Yeah it's  Private  The same  Hey there he is  How you doing  Sit down sir  Take a seat  And of course yes  We are on the air  Hi buddy  We just have people come in  And sit down  Colin Hanks hasn't changed 
[02:42:30]  In ten years  Are we on  Yeah we're actually on  Oh  Hey guys  I haven't seen you in ten years  You look exactly the same  I know right  Yeah  Kind of creepy  Yeah it's a little weird  A little weird  That's a little weird  Sorry microphone troubles  Yeah  Yeah I don't  I don't know  When that's going to happen  It'll happen fast  When you'll change  I'll let you know  That does suck though  Because all of a sudden  It's like bam  And they go  Oh what happened  Drugs  I bet it's drugs  No matter how  No matter how much I smoked  It never really did anything  You know who that happened with 
[02:43:00]  There was a few people  That happened with  One of which  Is  And oddly enough  We're just talking about Prometheus  In Alien  If you remember  Tom Skerritt  Who apparently got  Popular  At an older age  But in Alien  He just looked young enough  He had a little salty pepper  Going on  And then like  He just got real old  Real fast  He went to cocoon  It just happened like that  Another one that happened to  Was Richard Dreyfuss  In Jaws  He played like a young guy 
[02:43:30]  A young go-getter kid  And then like  But he wasn't young  No  He was playing a lot younger  He was playing younger  And then  But that sucks  Because then the next movie  Is in like  Goodbye girl  It's like  Hey who's the old guy  We had Dreyfuss in  He was fun  Yeah  We'll never see him again  Never came back  I think fun was a one-way street  I think he was promoting  Poseidon Adventure  He was  He was so  Oh  Yeah  Yeah  We might have been a little desperate  It needed our help  It was kind of flattering  That Dreyfuss needed our help  I'm actually reading the synopsis 
[02:44:00]  For the movie you're plugging  High School  Yeah  And it looks good  Yeah  I love the fucking concept  It focuses  Well do you want to say  No no no  Go ahead  No I was actually just going to read it  While Colin is sitting right here  I really am an asshole  Good idea  No not at all  You play Colin  Yeah  No it's bad  No it's always better than  The sort of thing  It's like  So tell us about the movie  Yeah  So tell me who you play  So tell me who else is in it 
[02:44:30]  So tell me what was it like  Yeah it's great  Tell me were there any funny stories  It's like  Wow you're not really doing anything  Yeah  You're not doing anything  You went to school for this  So no you're good  Brother  Go right ahead  Okay high school focuses on soon to be valedictorian Henry Burke  Not me  Matthew Bush  Matthew Bush  Not Colin  Not Colin  No  So who do you play  But talking about the young thing  I mean this was the first time where I went 
[02:45:00]  Oh my goodness  Like I'm no longer doing the high school kid  You're not the kid role  I'm not the kid  Now I'm the assistant dean  All right  You're working to the next level in your career  Slowly but surely  All right  You get to have sex with the students at least  Is it one of those movies  Well it is high school  Crazy things happen  That's true  High school  Oh  Oh  Focuses on a soon to be valedictorian Henry Burke  Played by Matthew Bush  Who smokes pot  Nice 
[02:45:30]  For the first time  Then discovers that a mandatory drug test  Has been scheduled at the school  He teams up with his stoner friend  Bro  B-R-E-A-U-X  Is the ex  Travis Burrow  Oh Burrow  Is by Sean  To make sure everyone fails  Together they spike the school's bake sale brownies  With high powered ganja  Stolen from a law student turned drug psycho ed  It's just great  They have to try to get everybody in the school high  By spiking it so everybody fails to test  Everyone fails  Oh that's good  It's very funny that a fucking valedictorian 
[02:46:00]  Spoke pot for the first time  That's Adrian Brody by the way  Yes  You should mention Adrian Brody's in this movie as well  Oh shit  Damn  And Michael Chiklis  Oh yeah  Who does he play?  He plays the dean  He plays like the Stacey Keach  Of this stoner film  Right right  As he did  To make a reference from a movie from the 70s  Yeah  Oh twinkle twinkle killer cane  Which the name of that was changed to something else  That was the Stacey Keach movie 
[02:46:30]  I cannot believe you just busted that out  That's impressive  What was that?  But what did they change it to?  They changed it to something  I don't know what it is  But they changed it to  The Poseidon Adventure?  Yeah  No I don't know  And so you play the assistant  No I'm the assistant  Look I mean basically  When  Look for years I've been getting scripts  It's like it's a story about a guy  Who wants to go to a thing  Because he likes the girl  But then this happens  And you just sort of go  Okay whatever  And then this one was  What's it about? 
[02:47:00]  Oh it's about two kids  That get their entire school stoned  Alright yeah  I'm in  Done  Sounds good  Sounds good  Yeah  Who am I?  Oh I'm good  And basically  I'm just  I play the assistant dean  To Michael Chiklis  Who you know  I know from  From the shield  Yes  Vic Mackey  Yeah  And I'm reading this thing  Going like  What is he going to do?  Like he's playing  A principal  And he's got this like wig  He's got a red wig 
[02:47:30]  Which I always find  You don't see very often in films  No that's right  You don't see that often in life  You don't really see a lot of people go  I'm going to go red wig  Part comb over  Not a lot of people  Opt for that wig  It's good luck  And he's got a  Like a  Should have more of that  Sort of weird pompous voice  That he does  He's doing this weird sort of thing  And so basically I just  Took it upon myself  To just egg him on  For five weeks  And said  Make an absolute ass  Out of yourself  Yeah  Please  Great  For my own personal amusement  And then if America  Happens to see 
[02:48:00]  Then we've done our job right  Well at least  The movie poster  Won't have you back to back  With somebody  Well now  Craziness happens  Oh boy  Yeah  Those tenants man  I mean I remember like  When I started  Pretty much any  Any teen movie  Like when I started  It was all  Sort of the  You know  Let's be honest  Can I cuss on this  Yes  You certainly can  When I started  It was all  Shitty teen movies  Right  For me  That was me  Like which ones  Which ones 
[02:48:30]  For a reference point  I'm not going to name names  But it doesn't matter  Because really  What year did you hit  What year did you hit  The first movie I was in  Was 98  Was it the one with Jack  Well if you got  Orange County  No it wasn't  That was a good one  That was the last time  We saw you  Yeah that was a long time ago  With Jack  But they were all  Pretty much  Three word phrases  With an exclamation point  Just  Oh yeah  Throw  It doesn't matter  What it was named 
[02:49:00]  When the writer wrote it  We're just gonna  Give me a phrase  Throw an explanation point  On it  And that's the movie  Did it have dude  In the title  One of them did  One of them did  I wasn't in that one  I know  But pretty much  Just give me a phrase  Like give me a phrase  Right now  And throw an exclamation point  After it  Get over it  Yes  Get over it  That was one of them  Oh man  Although a lot of people  Actually like that  I didn't see that  No no no no  A lot of people  Tell me they like that movie 
[02:49:30]  Yeah  I'll take  I'll take that  I don't know  I put a lot into the  Looking at the covers  Of movies  In the stores and stuff  Yeah  In the stores  Well like Best Buy  And stuff  Well when I did  I put a lot into that  Stores  Stores  What is that  Stores  Stores  Brick and mortar  A brick and mortar  Stores  The back to back cover  You think is awful  I can't stand  The rom-com  Back to back  Oh boy  That's the Matthew McConaughey  Where it's just  And the girl's going 
[02:50:00]  Oh boy  You are up to it again  And he's like  I'll show you  And she's like  You're not getting  You're not getting one  Over on me  That was the original cover  Of Schindler's List  It was Liam Neeson  And Ben Kinsley  Look at each other  That's just  It's not going to work  We have to  Oh no  That would kind of be funny  To take to some really  Sad movies  Sad movies  And make a  Like JFK  You have Costner  And fucking  And Gary Oldman  Peeking at each other  If that's the case 
[02:50:30]  Then it would have been  Pronounced  Schindler's List  That's pretty much  What it is  I mean any phrase  It's got to  Get over it  Schindler's List  Exclamation point  A lot of fun  Put that down  That could be  One of the movies  I mean it's any phrase  She's the one  Yeah that was one  She's the one  That was a movie  Yeah  That's pretty much  All you do  What's the cover  Of this one  You don't know  What's the movie  Poster for high school  I've seen a few  Of them 
[02:51:00]  I think it's just  A high school locker  With a weed leaf  Drawn on it  And smoke coming out  And a little smoke  Coming out  I was saying  There has to be  Smoke coming out of it  There's got to be  Some sort of smoke  Some sort of smoke  Well I hope that  It's not really  Sending that message  That this is okay  To do  You know  For the younger people  Who might see it  The kids  It's a really funny thing  People have asked me  Like so what do you  Think this says  About  And I go  Oh really  This is a  This is a  Stupid funny movie  That's all  It's supposed to be  You are looking 
[02:51:30]  At things  Way too seriously  Yeah  Good for you  Because other guys  Would try to  You know  Answer that dumb question  Yeah  Well I think it says  A lot about our society  As a whole  And I think it's important  That we all just realize  That we're all the same  Really we all have  Our same fears  And desires  And that you know  Once you smoke weed  It just  It helps you  Get in touch  With that  To fucking  People should  Just shut up  And also though  Some actors  Are a little silly  When they talk about  Their characters  It's like  He taught me so much 
[02:52:00]  This character  Especially when the guy  Played a rapist  That's just disturbing  It's just uncomfortable  He taught me that  No can mean yes  Oh my god  Yeah  Yeah  More chicks do that  Than guys though  When you watch interviews  They get really into their roles  Yeah  She  She would be my friend  She taught me  So much  I was still  Being this character  Months after we wrapped 
[02:52:30]  Where you  Stop talking about it  Like it's a real person  It's on the paper  Unless you're playing  A real person  Like Sally  Field and Norma Ray  Or something  Like then you can say  You learn from the real person  That's different  That's different  Where Cher is Silkwood  I don't know  I wasn't going to  Karen Silkwood  Yeah  Yeah I know  I know  I saw that movie  I saw that one  Where's Cher been lately  Boy you haven't seen her around  Hiding from her daughter's last  I think she's still 
[02:53:00]  Trying to turn back time  I don't know  How's that working out  I don't care  What anybody says  I'm still a big  Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves fan  How can you not love that song  Yeah  It's on my iPod  Fucking rules  Is it really  Yes  Jimmy has a very eclectic  Wow  Let's have the show with that  Wow  Just play that at the end  For Jim North  What are you listening to  I saw you  You were at Springsteen  Right  You and your dad  I saw you there  I walked by you  At Springsteen  I said  I've never seen him live  And I'm not a Springsteen fan  He's amazing  That's your first show  Yeah  It was awesome 
[02:53:30]  I actually downloaded  Wrecking Ball  And fucking  He's great man  He's amazing  Yeah that's why  I bumped into you there  And yeah  You're a Springsteen fan  Yeah  Yeah  I mean like  But for me  Look for me  It's a little bit different  Because for me  It was  That was the  Holdover from my parents  Collection  That then I took over  Do you know what I mean  So it's a little bit  Different for me  But I've seen him  Play enough to just go  Like well this is  Just amazing  It is amazing  He's amazing  That's just  The band is amazing  Yeah you can't go in there 
[02:54:00]  Even if you're not a fan  Because I'm not a big  Bruce fan  That's a fucking  Crazy Bruce fan  Right there  Roland  Yeah  But just watching him  And realizing  You know  The guy's  What is he  61 or something  60  Roland  62  He's running around  Like a maniac  He's jumping  Into the crowd  Roland said it  He's aging backwards  Yeah  He really is  He's in great shape  He sounded great  And the band was  You know  17 people up there  He was playing  He was awesome  Yeah  I snapped the most  Awkward picture  With your father  I didn't know  I was talking to this 
[02:54:30]  Cop and he goes  And I see this  Big tall guy  Turn around  I'm like  Oh fuck  Can we take a picture  And his head's  All chopped off  Fucking humiliating  He's definitely  Digging it  It's funny for  People to see  Really big celebrities  Just out  Enjoying themselves  You know  Obviously to you  Like at a rock concert  Yeah exactly  Obviously to you  It's like  Oh it's just my dad  Doing that  But everyone else  Is looking up  And going  Hey Tom Hanks  Is like  Bopping to Springsteen 
[02:55:00]  Why is he doing that  How awful would it be  If you're like  In the middle of the song  To walk over with a script  And go look  I have this idea  Oh my god  What always makes me laugh  Is like  Especially at concerts  I can't help but look  At like other celebrities  And go like  Man  They really can't dance  They have to know  I think  It was at that  Yeah  It was at that show  And Bruce was like  Going  He was in the crowd  And standing up on the stairs 
[02:55:30]  And I saw  Paul Rudd  Kind of like  Try to help Bruce down  And like  Bruce was like  I don't need help  Leave me alone  Not like  I don't need help  From you  Paul Rudd actor  It was just like  I'm not even acknowledging you  It was like  A dinosaur  Batting away a fly  It did not matter  This is my show  I know how to do this  And that's always funny  But then it's always  The split second afterwards  It's always like  Oh okay  Yep  That's okay  That's good  And you're like  A little embarrassed 
[02:56:00]  Yeah  I do that  That I do  The guy came with the scripts  That would make me  Super uncomfortable  Yeah that would be  Super uncomfortable  Me and Jimmy  Were talking about  That sitting there  Because we love  We talked about  Just uncomfortable moments  We love  Not doing the uncomfortable moments  I don't like being in them  But just thinking about  Yeah  Don't like being in them  Love thinking about them  Talking about them  And thinking about them  Hilarious for some reason  Seeing them  Other people  Right  But we were like  Imagine if you just went up  And said  Look I know 
[02:56:30]  I don't want to bother  How awkward  Like in the middle  Of like an anthem song  Where everybody's enjoying  If you're like  Look look look  Look please  Just how fucking  Cringeworthy  Tom I'm sorry  Listen I know he's playing  Promise Land  But I have a script  Called Promise Land  But I think you would  You play a cop  You play a cop  And I play a cop  But we don't get along  At first  I've done a mark up  Of what the cover  Will look like  This is your back  And this is mine  Alright here's 
[02:57:00]  I storyboarded it  Here  Let me lay these out for you  Could you move please  Could you move  But see the thing is  It's not called  The Promise Land  It's called  Promise Land  Land  That's an exclamation point  So Springsteen  Is not  Who's your  Who's your guy  Musically  Like Springsteen  You like  But who's your  Who's the one  That you  Oh god  You know  That's  I can't do the one  Right now  There's a bunch  And now  And Cher  Cher's up there  Is she  I don't know  I don't think  She's really up there 
[02:57:30]  For me  Yes he is  For me  For you  For you  That's fine  For me  Not so much  No I'm now  At a point where  It's pretty much anything  Yeah  It really  Yeah  It's the  It's wide spectrum  Of stuff  Yeah you're open minded  Then huh  Yeah  You haven't stopped  At a decade yet  No no no no  No  I'm not staying  In one decade  For sure  I'm going all over  I kind of jammed  On the brakes  At 2000  Kind of jammed  On the brakes  So I'll pop in  Some Alice in Chains  And be like  This shit ruled 
[02:58:00]  Good enough for me  There you go  I jammed on the brakes  In 78  I'm a fucking asshole  Stuck in my first  10 years of life  Just a childish idiot  Just  Discovering Bruce  In 2012  Dude I'm the worst  I actually tweeted  Springsteen is great  It was like  In 2012  I'm a fool  Good job Jimmy  Yeah  I can't believe  That was your first  Springsteen show  I saw McCartney  For the first time  A year earlier  At the Apollo  Now the series  Gets some great shows  At the Apollo  The McCartney show  Is amazing  McCartney doesn't really  Tour a lot 
[02:58:30]  Not like Bruce does  But guys who I wouldn't  See in an arena  Who I respect  Like I knew  Springsteen was good  The shit I like  By Springsteen  Is weird stuff  Like I like  Youngstown  And The Hitter  Like songs that are  Not at all  Fucking hits  What about Candy's Room  I wouldn't know that  If he stood there  And sang it to me  Did you just  Like get into him  After the show  Or you had listened  To him for years  I had bought a bunch  Of his stuff  Because he's such  A legendary guy  And I'm like  You gotta  And I had  You gotta try  You have to try  And I got some  And I liked it  But I just kind of 
[02:59:00]  Forgot I had it  And then I went  And saw it  And I was like  Fuck man  He was awesome  He was awesome  I get why people love him  The last couple albums  You think were just  Throwaways  But there's amazing  Songs on the last few  There are good tracks  On those albums  Unbelievable  I didn't realize  Take care of our own  I didn't know  They were all  Fucking new tunes  Wow  That was uncanny  Yeah people  I was in a  Post cover band  For a while  I would only do  That line  Good  I want to congratulate  Colin on the LA Kings  Winning the Stanley Cup  Did he win?  That's not official  Oh no  He just jinxed 
[02:59:30]  The shit out  Not this time  Not this time  Not this time  Kings are by far  The best team  In the NHL playoffs  For the next game  I'm really torn right now  The entire playoffs  By far everyone knew  That the Kings were  Yeah  It is killing me  That I'm not there  Oh you want to be there  For it right  Oh my god  I've been a Kings fan  Since 1987  See if it was over here  You could have got a ticket  Well this is where  I'm kind of like  Karmically screwed  Because I'm here  And I'm going to miss  The game tonight  I saw your tweet  Which is at home  Right  So they could win 
[03:00:00]  Right  Like they could be  Skating around  Holding the Stanley Cup  I could be there  And you could be there  Easily  Screaming my tits off  What the hell  Are you doing here?  Go home  I know  And then  Fuck the movie  If they lose  They come back here  And you'll be gone  And I'll be gone  I'll be back in Los Angeles  So pretty much  Is this movie that important really?  Can't you stay here for next time?  I was saying straight up  This has to win  Every single Oscar this year  For this to be worth it  It premiered Sundance in 2010  How come it's just coming out now?  Just funding and stuff?  You know the business, Jimmy 
[03:00:30]  Okay  No, I don't, obviously  No  To be honest, I don't know  I honestly don't know  I think there were some people  That were just like  Alright, well  There's a way to sell this movie  But we've got to  Find out how to  I have no idea  Oh, it's one of those things  Yeah  I think it was like  One of those things, yeah  Can't you stay and watch the game, though?  If they win  Or do you have to go back for promo?  He wants to be  No, I want to be  No, I mean stay  No, I'm going to watch the game tonight  I'm not doing anything tonight  That's what I'm doing  I've got my hat  I've got my 1991 Smite Division shirt  That has not been washed  Since the Western Conference Finals 
[03:01:00]  We're good  Oh, you're hardcore  Yeah, we're good  Have you always been a hardcore Kings fan?  Yeah  Yeah  Hardcore hockey fan  Hardcore hockey fan in general  See, Roland, just like you  Did you see that shirt?  As soon as he walked in  As soon as he gave me my coffee  We talked Kings for like 10 minutes  But his shirt's a week old  Yeah, yeah  He jumps on every bandwagon  Oh, he is a bandwagon  Although this one  He's trying to tell us  That he's been a Kings fan for a while  No, he knows his obscure King references  Yeah, I know  He does  He might  How's Gretzky? 
[03:01:30]  He dropped the puck the other night  I shook his hand  Did you really?  Were you starstruck?  No  Had you met him before?  I had met him before  And I said, hi  Nice to see you again  When having a famous father  And he goes, hi  Are you ever starstruck?  Yeah, that's one of the top guys  Like who, though?  The people that I give a shit about  Like who?  Like who?  Who did you meet or work with  Or whatever that you're like  Uh, Cher  Cher  Actually, you want to know what?  When I was in New Zealand for King Kong  Cher came to visit one day 
[03:02:00]  And they said, do you want to meet Cher?  And I said, no  I don't  Wow, really?  I did not go  Are you serious?  I swear to God  I think you've got to meet Cher  They said, do you want to come in and meet Cher?  And I said, no, I'm good  I said, no, I'm good  Good for you  I'm going to go get lunch  But I guess when you grow up in a famous house  It's not as  It doesn't mean as much  Your house is famous?  Yes  I've got a famous house  Psycho house  No, it's the Amityville house in Long Island  But you probably get used to a certain amount of celebrity being around  But who blew you away that you met?  Well, it was more about the people that I really sort of admire 
[03:02:30]  The people that I sort of listen to  So, like, the first time I met Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age  I was sort of like, oh, right  Oh, really?  Wow, okay  But then the bonus is that I sort of am able to get over it a little quickly  And then it doesn't matter  And now we're friends  So that's, like, the bonus  You're able to still have those geek out moments  But then at the end of the day you go  That's cool, he wipes his ass  That's cool 
[03:03:00]  I know, but I think that  And then go, I'd love to do it for him  Just as a fan  That's what we like to share, I guess  We've got those moments  We're not friends with Tom Papa  Yeah  See?  We've never been over the house  I do  I wanted to invite you guys to my house the other night  And I didn't know if I was crossing the line or not  I didn't know if you guys felt like  It would be  Would it be annoying than have to say no?  I would go  Where is it?  Would you go?  Downtown  Oh, it's downtown?  Yeah  I leave New York City 
[03:03:30]  I couldn't possibly  That's exactly how I thought it would go  I go out to Long Island  Then I've got to come back  Yeah  You know, we have a connection to Colin and his family there  Our agent bought a house, I'll just say close by  Oh, really?  And I went out there to see the new house  And he had to drive me by Pop's house  Oh, really?  And brag  And I'm like, alright, great  So tell your father  If he hears the French horn bellowing out of a garage  His awful radio agent  He couldn't wait to show me where your father lives  I'm like, alright, well, how about your house? 
[03:04:00]  How about Bob fucking starts working  Yeah, that'd be nice  And does an agent work and not brag  About his neighbors  I'm glad I don't live at his house anymore  Because then that way I don't have to see your friend  It's our radio agent  And trust me, we fucking bought part of that house  We bought a big part of that fucking house  And a nice chunk  Yeah, so how about you show me what I bought  Instead of some other guy's house  Eight to twelve of the bedrooms  You bought about eight to twelve of the bedrooms  Holy fuck, I'm like, really? 
[03:04:30]  And the bidets  I guess we did well for you, huh, Bob?  All the bidets in the bathroom  You've got to see this place, man  You're going to be blown away  Wait, you live on Long Island?  Yeah  Alright, so help me out  You from Long Island?  Originally, yeah  Alright, so let me ask you a question  And this is for the table  Oh, sure  Billy Joel or Bruce Springsteen?  Oh, yeah, yeah  Gotta go Billy Joel  Because of the Long Island  But you have to  I prefer Billy Joel  That's our boy from Long Island  Well, that's where I am  It's either that or Dee Schneider 
[03:05:00]  We've got to go Billy Joel  We've got to go Billy Joel  I know  No, I have to  I mean, literally  I know  I was raised a town away  Wow  Cold Spring Harbor and all that  I don't know if I could go Billy Joel on this one  You have to  I think Bruce Springsteen is obviously doing much better  We had to start the fire  Billy Joel's an arena act, though  He's not as big as Springsteen  But he's a fucking arena act  I would've went with Captain Jack or something  I would've put that on the table  No, I was just kidding  Yeah  Piano man  Piano man 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, we didn't start the fire  That's the easy joke  Colin Quinn hates that fucking song so much  I love how much  I'm sure he hates Colin Quinn  Yeah, I'm sure he does, too  He should love it  It's all 80s stuff  It's funny, that song speaks so highly of him  Yeah, yeah  You go Springsteen over Billy Joel  That's sacrilegious, you know  I gotta kinda  Gotta do it  I don't know  Bruce, sure  He's got a lot of hits, too  Yeah  He's been around a long, long time  Still out there rocking, too  Yeah, winning the marathon  I think on this one 
[03:06:00]  I'm not a Billy Joel  I don't come from a Billy Joel household  Yes, yes  So it's very easy for me  But I would always sort of go  Then go to the live show  Let's go to the tape  Right, right  Let's go to the tape  And let's see  And he puts on a good live show  Billy Joel  Yeah  For someone that's sitting down  I know  That's just  For the entire show  For the entire show  For the whole show  Yeah, he really can't stand  Even if he wanted to  No  Be uncomfortable  He hunched over the piano  How do you stand up in that situation? 
[03:06:30]  During Uptown Girl  He's constantly still  Kind of bent over a little bit  He's in that weird, awkward position  Did he at least move the piano around  As he's performing?  Have guys to just move it around?  He does that cute walk during Uptown Girl  Oh  Oh, he's trying to dance  With a wrench in his hand  The video was terrible  I saw him and Elton together  They were great  You see that at the Garden?  I don't remember where it was  Years ago  It might have been Jersey  Battlelands  This is probably about  2003 or 2004  It's interesting that they've got 
[03:07:00]  They've retired their numbers  In the Garden  Elton John  Yeah, they did  They absolutely did  Well, Elton played at the Queen's Diamond Jubilee  The Jubilee  That's right  The Jubilee  The Jubilee  And so did McCartney  And McCartney just fucking  Like sounds exactly like McCartney  Yeah  Elton  Boy, every year he kicks those songs  Down another octave  Oh, really?  It's just  A little deeper  It's like, you know  Goodbye, yellow brick road 
[03:07:30]  And the dark clouds as I  I mean, he's no kid anymore  What did McCartney play?  It was good to see the Queen of England  Elton  She had a very smart hunting hat on  Did you see that hat?  It looked like the rabbit  The Mad Hatter  It looked like the Mad Hatter hat  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  It had a weird fucking shape to it  She's standing out there in the rain  Fuck her  Wow 
[03:08:00]  It's the Queen  Wow, what an American sentiment  Exactly  That was actually  Yeah, you redcoats  No, he's just reading  Prince Philip's clip  We were watching  Hoping that she'd have a stroke  Or something  I don't want any  It's a little different over here  It's a little different  From our vantage point  What did McCartney say?  I don't know  I just kind of passed by it  Amazingly enough  I didn't even stop  I actually like his new song  We hated it when I first heard  Of the Grammys  But I like  Yeah 
[03:08:30]  My Valentine  I don't know if I love the chorus  But it's actually a good fucking tune, man  Yeah  The chorus annoys me with my Valentine  But that's taking up space  Where he could be doing a Beatles song  That's the problem  I must say  When you hear the new stuff  You're like, yeah  But you could have been playing  He's got to play some of the new stuff  He's got to play some of it  Not when you're McCartney, though  Yeah, no  That should be against the rules  He's been doing it for over 50 years  For his own sanity  He needs to play some of the new stuff  Imagine that  You're absolutely right 
[03:09:00]  For his own sanity  You want to hear Hey Jude now?  You've got to listen to two of the new ones  That's the way it works  We were at the Apollo  And he's singing yesterday  And you're like, that's the guy  It's the guy singing the song  This isn't off-cover, man  Here's the really crazy thing  21 when he wrote that song  Wow  Like, 21  Like, I'm now  Like, I'm now at the point  Where I am old enough  Even though I look like I'm 12  I'm old enough to now go  He's how old when he writes yesterday? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, yeah  They're how old when they do Day in a Life?  You know, I'm starting to trip out  On the age thing a lot  How old was McCartney when the Beatles broke out?  He wasn't even 30  Oh, man  That's unbelievable  You just assume he was older  Yeah, you just assume he's  He had to be in his early, mid-30s maybe  You know, a ripe age  Yeah, they broke up in 70, right?  It does suck when you start passing people  Wait, how old was he?  Now this is going to freak me out  Like, celebrities that have died at certain ages  And you start passing those ages 
[03:10:00]  Right  It's like, oh, fuck, man  I think I just passed McQueen  No, I'm fucking when they die  How about when they do their important stuff?  Oh, yeah, yeah  And you go, what have I done?  What have I done?  Nothing  He wrote yesterday at 21  I read the paper  I was pedging  I read the pedging  I read the pedging  What year did the Beatles officially break out?  I think 1970  So he was 28  28  God  Yeah  28  Now imagine then  We're talking about why he's got to play some of the new stuff 
[03:10:30]  Imagine at 28 then knowing for the rest of your life  You're only going to be talking about the stuff you did before 28  Oh, yeah  That's  When you really break that down  That's kind of crazy  Oh, no, listen  I'm with you  I'm with you  On his own little trip  He did have wings  Wings had some good songs  Yeah, kind of, you know  But he does do Beatles songs, which I love  He doesn't shy away from them  Like, he will play Let It Be  Like, he'll play What You Want to Hear  But he throws new stuff in 
[03:11:00]  And, you know, you tolerate it  But he does sound good  He's going to be 70, right?  But he sounds good  That's the thing  He sounds good  Yeah  Or is he 70 now?  He's going to be 70 this year  He does sound amazing  Well, he turned 64 a few years ago  Because they were talking about the song  And I don't think he's 70 yet  I want to say he's 68  No, he's going to be 70 this year  If he didn't turn already  When's his birthday?  Oh, I remember  Yeah, I remember that  When I'm 64  That seems like it was last month  But apparently it was  Yeah, years ago  Five years ago  Ten years ago  He turned 70 in about two weeks  Seven years  So it was six years ago  Six years ago that thing happened 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, no, I thought it happened last month  Last month, right  June 18th, he'll be 70  Are you giving the high sign there?  Yeah, Colin's got to go  Oh, Colin's a busy, busy man  We have to properly promote high school  It's limited release here in New York  The AMC Empire 25  That's on West 42nd Street  In Manhattan, 234 West 42nd  And AMC Lowe's Village 7  Which is 66 3rd Avenue  It's a limited release here in the city 
[03:12:00]  But go and support it  Because I very rarely will read a synopsis  That honestly looks good  And this honestly looks like a good comedy  That's all right  And anyone who's not in New York City  Good fucking luck  No, find the website  It's on the website somewhere  That's true  Unless you're at a Kings game  In this day and age with technology  I'm sure you can find it  Yeah, it's out there  I'm sure you can find it  I'm sure you're watching it right now  Guys, can it be  I don't know  Maybe less than 10 years  Before I come back  I don't know what happened  A little sooner than 10 years  A little sooner than 10 years 
[03:12:30]  We would love to have you  I'm really glad there wasn't  Like a drunk midget  Crying  Yeah, the crying midget  That wanted to be a stripper  That's one of the highlights  Of our entire career  I made her cry  I remember  Come on, we all made her cry  I asked about a tattoo  And it was like  That was a lesson  That was a lesson  Never ask anyone about a tattoo  Wait, you started it?  Yes  Yeah, she had a tattoo  And I was trying  Honestly  Where's the tattoo?  It was on the lower back  I was honestly 
[03:13:00]  Trying to come up  With the most  Simple  Simple  Like question  Like I wouldn't go  In anything personal  I'm like let's just try  What's the tattoo?  Well that was the fact  That's the word  That got her  Tattoo  Why'd she cry over that?  I made her cry  Why'd she cry over that?  Because it had something  To do with her dad  Oh, right  Yeah, you struck that  Emotional nerve  It was a tiny little nerve  It made her go  So we have you to blame  Yeah, that's great 
[03:13:30]  Yeah  I'm surprised you guys  Remember that  Man  Well we remember  She was crying and all  But I didn't realize  It was because you started  I remember you guys  Being in there  Remember she was trying  To cover up  Because she was  Crying so hard  Oh God  That was just  A whole  That was just  An hour of  Uncomfortable  For me  It was just  A big chunk  Of uncomfortable  For Tom Papa  She was a  Midget that wanted  To become a stripper  So we knew  A few things  About stripping  And strippers  So we're like  Come on in  And we'll see  If you got  What it takes  Oh no  So she was stripping 
[03:14:00]  For the first time  I remember coming  Out of the studio  And my publicist  Is sitting there  Reading the papers  She goes  So how'd it go  And I'm like  You weren't listening  To that  Oh my god  That's your job  Wow  You got some questions  Ten years  She was awful man  Yeah  So I'm glad  That we didn't  Have that  I'm glad  We did Bruce  And Billy Joel  We did a little  Share action here  For Mr. Norton  We're all good  The movie  High school  The movie  The Kings  And we're so good  So maybe  I don't know 
[03:14:30]  Less than ten years  And our creepy agent  That's stalking your dad  Less than ten years  I'll come back  In less than ten years  And hopefully  Your agent will have  A new house  Yeah  Someone else to bug  A smaller house  I hope he has a new house  I hope it's a little one  That's buried  Six feet under the ground  Get it  I'm just kidding  I don't mean it  It's not his agent  No he is  You're screwed  He negotiated  My spectacular deal here  Hence me hoping  He goes bye bye  In the box  Fuck him
