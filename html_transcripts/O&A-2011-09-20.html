<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a humorous introduction by Larry King, calling the show "insane," "fucking bizarre," and "not politically correct." Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton then reacted to listener tweets, often delayed, expressing frustration with vague praise and difficulty recalling past show content.  A substantial portion focused on the Charlie Sheen roast, praising Amy Schumer and Patrice O'Neal's performances, despite their exclusion from MSNBC's highlights in favor of more famous roasters.  Jim Norton discussed his own exclusion from roasts.  The conversation then turned to *Dancing with the Stars*, mocking Nancy Grace's appearance and dancing, with graphic descriptions and crude jokes. Chaz Bono's performance was also satirized.  Other topics included the updated *Two and a Half Men* after Charlie Sheen's departure, Mariano Rivera's baseball record, the New York Jets, a Dallas Cowboys quarterback's injury, and John Cryer's career trajectory, highlighting his rise to fame.  A discussion about hair-replacement products followed, sparked by John Cryer’s appearance, featuring offensive commentary on an infomercial.  Dolores Hope's death led to a discussion on mortality and aging, followed by a story about a child's rapidly healing scratch, sparking a discussion on children's healing and stem cell research. The show concluded with comedic alternate trailers for *The Shining* and *Dumb and Dumber*.

The show continued with an anecdote about a snowcat insurance claim denial involving an axe, a wife, and a "negro" scratching the vehicle. This transitioned into a discussion of creepy movie music, focusing on *The Shining*'s opening theme, followed by a comparison of other films' scores, including *The Exorcist* and *The Omen*.  The conversation then shifted to Jim Croce and his music, exploring its impact on listeners and the themes of mortality.  Similar artists like The Carpenters, Bread, Harry Chapin, and Cat Stevens were discussed.  A lengthy, vulgar analysis of Bobby Goldsboro's "Honey" followed, with a darkly humorous retelling of its narrative.  Comedian Jeff Dunham then appeared as a guest.  Prior to his arrival, clips from the Charlie Sheen roast, including sets from Amy Schumer and Patrice O'Neal, were played and briefly discussed.  With Dunham present, the conversation centered on his career, negative reactions to his act, YouTube promotion, the international popularity of "Achmed the Dead Terrorist," and the challenges of overseas merchandise production, particularly his puppets.  A significant portion detailed Dunham's use of 3D printing technology in puppet creation, including anecdotes and technical descriptions.

The segment with Jeff Dunham continued, focusing heavily on his use of 3D printing for puppet parts, including materials like ABS plastic and titanium, and cost variations.  He discussed unusual creations and the failed puppet, Eggelbert Humpty Dink.  The conversation included jokes about flesh-printing.  Dunham also discussed his appearances on *The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson*, including an anecdote about filling in after Carson's son's death, his experiences with ventriloquism, and comparisons to stand-up comedy.  The segment concluded with a brief discussion of Patrice O'Neal's roast performance and a clip of Mayor Menino's rambling speech.  Walter, one of Dunham’s puppets, was also shown.

The final segment began with riffing on Mayor Thomas Menino's proclamation of WBZ Radio Day, repeatedly playing and mocking his mispronunciations ("Boffiston," "Morstan," etc.), speculating on the cause.  Humorous imitations and commentary followed.  Short clips of Chip Chipperson interacting with cosplayers at a comic convention were played, featuring vulgar and sexually suggestive language and crude jokes.  The bulk of the segment then focused on a caller, Sam Roberts, whose mother attends a women's club.  The hosts and Sam engaged in raunchy speculation about the club's activities, using innuendo and sexual jokes, culminating in a highly graphic, fictionalized description of a "ass play" segment.  The show concluded with plans to interview Sam's mother the next day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hi, it's Larry King. What the hell am I doing here?  Wait a minute, you want me to intro the Opie and Anthony show?  You gotta go.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony show right here on Sirius XM Satellite.  Yeah, oh, fuck yeah! This place is insane!  You guys like to cuss on it.  Yeah, a lot. It's a weird show.  Yes, interesting interviews and of course your phone calls as well.  It's not the most talked about, not the most written about, and certainly not the most listened to show in the history of radio, but I'm still proud to intro it. 
[00:00:30]  This show is so disordered.  Holy shit.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Everybody's not politically correct.  Opie and Anthony were saying that.  Well then, turn off God dang Opie and Anthony, you dumb ass.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  Where else are you going to be able to say that and get paid for it?  Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I presented this, by the way, one of the highlights of my career.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  By the way, who's Jim Norton? 
[00:01:00]  Morning.  Or good afternoon.  Morning.  Let's acknowledge the guys that listened to the replay.  Good afternoon.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  If you're listening to this on the replay, tweet me.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Sometimes I think more people listen to the replay than the live show.  I've noticed that, too.  Somewhere around 3, 3.30. 
[00:01:30]  People start tweeting about stuff we talked about in the morning.  And I'm like, I don't care about that stuff anymore.  That's hours ago in my life.  I live to throw it already.  You know what the worst tweets are at like 3, 4 o'clock?  All of them.  Every single one.  When you look and see something like, hey, Anthony, I agree, but there's something about it that just doesn't wash.  And then you're like, am I supposed to remember what the fuck I said? 
[00:02:00]  You fucking nailed it.  At whatever it would be, 7.25.  If it's not like 3.25.  I'm not alive, motherfucker.  Someone tweeted me yesterday and said, Opie, that was fucking brilliant.  And I'm thinking to myself, I'm rarely brilliant.  Tell me what thing it was.  Help me understand.  Can't you write something just like, I don't know.  They're not even filling up all their words.  They just say something like that. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  That's an actual tweet from yesterday.  And I'm thinking to myself, fuck, what was it?  Maybe I could do more of that.  But isn't it just that it works for someone on Twitter, something positive?  And I've done it like, you just want to go like, well, what do you mean?  What exactly did I do right?  But you can't get that in 140 characters without sounding awful.  Yeah, but I just need the subject matter.  Something, whatever it was, please.  I still don't know because I wrote the guy back.  He doesn't even bother to write me back.  Give me a hint.  Something, please. 
[00:03:00]  Fucking some good TV watching last night, huh?  There was a lot of stuff on, of course, the Sheen Roast.  I've only seen a couple clips of the Sheen Roast because it started too fucking late, man.  Yeah, I was starting to nod out on the couch watching it.  But we're going to have all the clips for everybody and go through it.  I hear Amy Schumer is a rock star today.  She stirred some shit up, I guess.  She stirred some shit up with a Ryan Dunn joke.  But it is a roast.  Yeah, of course it is.  It is a roast.  Go for her.  Go for her.  That's a dangerous place to fucking be. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Right?  If it's the joke, I talked to her before, and if it's the joke I'm thinking, it wasn't  even that bad.  It wasn't mean.  It was funny.  You can even see it.  That's Stevo.  Yeah.  It wasn't a fucking...  Yeah.  William Shatner had a few doozies.  Yeah.  Mike Tyson sucked really bad.  But I guess because he's a big fucking famous person, you got to put him on the roast.  Yeah.  Instead of a real comic like, I don't know.  Oh.  Who might have been able to go in there? 
[00:04:00]  Oh, I have no idea.  Let me look around.  Is anyone...  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, boy.  I don't know who could have filled that spot.  I actually...  I understand why.  Tyson might be friends with him.  Sometimes they'll put a friend to the guy on there.  So if someone has a relationship with him, like Kate Walsh, I don't know what her relationship  is.  I would bet money that Sheen's not friends friends with Mike Tyson.  They do that because they want big names.  I was telling Anthony...  We love you down there, Jimmy.  We love you.  Yeah.  As long as you guys love me, I'm happy.  MSNBC just did a whole montage of the Charlie Sheen roast. 
[00:04:30]  And I told that right before it hit, I go, watch.  They're not going to show Patrice or Amy Schumer because they're not famous enough.  And I bet you they had great sets.  We'll find out soon, right?  Well, according to my Twitter, they certainly had great sets.  What did they do?  They showed Jeffrey Ross because he's famous.  You know, he's famous.  And he's like the roast master.  And he's the roast master.  He's great at those things.  Then they showed Mike Tyson because he's really famous.  And then they showed William Shatner.  And that was it.  Yeah.  That was it.  Instead of the comics that you know did way better than Mike Tyson and Shatner. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  That really like fucking tore him up.  Yeah.  But, you know, I was reading a lot of tweets and people were like, really?  Now?  This is kind of a nine months ago thing?  Yeah.  I mean, I know that he kind of looks like he almost has his shit together now.  And Two and a Half Men was debuting the season.  And I guess that's why they chose to do it now.  But a lot of the jokes were nine-month-old Twitter jokes. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Well, what are you going to do?  Eh, roast them.  I mean, a lot of people.  This is what a lot of people are talking about today, though.  I heard Patrice was great.  Yeah.  I heard Patrice was great.  And I heard Amy was great, too.  I didn't hear anybody was bad.  I mean, no one tanked.  I didn't hear anybody.  But the names I heard that were great was Patrice.  No ball-eating.  But why do they feel like they have to have recognizable people?  I don't get that, man.  I mean, there was a couple slots there that certainly should have been for Jim Norton and a few other people we know. 
[00:06:00]  Just get the best comics out there that really know how to roast and go for it.  Fuck the big names.  Well, they love me.  I mean, I've talked to them before.  They've told me, we love you, Jim.  Hey, we love you, Jim.  You know, but...  Yeah, how about a roast?  Fuck them.  It's, you know...  Fuck them.  I'm never going to get anything from them, and I understand that.  Why, you think?  I honestly don't know.  It's not...  Are you too dirty?  No.  I don't think I'm too edgy or any of that stuff. 
[00:06:30]  They get it.  They just don't like it.  I meet with those guys, and I think that they like me personally.  Like, I don't think that they're that good of actors.  Like, I genuinely believe they like me personally.  They just don't like me as a comic.  It is what it is.  That's fucked up.  But whatever.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  I don't agree.  It's annoying, but Patrice had to go on last, and I heard that by the time you go on,  which to me is annoying that they put him on last, because he doesn't do a lot of roasts,  and it's like, even though he is funny enough to go on last, it's like, you know, can you  for once just take care of somebody? 
[00:07:00]  And I heard he was great.  He just fucking threw out the notes.  Oh, wow.  It was so frustrating.  Yeah, because it's probably everybody already said everything that you could say.  And yeah, I heard it.  Jonathan told me that he was just fucking tremendous.  Oh, good.  I got to hear that.  I can't wait.  He was vintage Patrice.  Yeah, we're going to have the best of the best clips from the roast in a few minutes  here.  Sam's just finishing up on that.  Also, I took a peek at Two and a Half Men last night, and I took a peek, and I swear  I don't watch this show on a regular basis. 
[00:07:30]  Please don't kill me.  Dancing with the fucking Stars.  I don't even understand that fucking show, why it does so goddamn well.  I told Ant, they get these professional dancers that know what the fuck they're doing,  and then they put a huge truck tire and tie it to their ankle and make them dance.  Just an albatross.  Just an albatross on their ankle.  That they have to drag around the dance floor.  Yeah.  You've got to see Nancy Grace.  She's not even human.  I told Anthony, I think Chaz Bono is hotter than Nancy Grace. 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  And that says a lot of stuff right now.  Wow.  Nancy Grace is brutal looking.  And they had her in a dance leotard fucking outfit thing.  Was she just bulging out in places?  She's got massive tits.  Does she?  Massive, which usually you would go, all right.  Even on an ugly broad, you would kind of go, all right.  But the rest of her is so hideous.  I'm calling her tit mom then.  Yeah.  You should.  Hey, tit mom.  You should.  Her arms don't even look human.  They don't look just, what are they, pudgy? 
[00:08:30]  They're just pudgy, yes.  She's pudgy.  They're pudgy in a way they don't really look like arms anymore.  Was she showing leg?  I didn't see the legs because when I did tune in, they were just interviewing her, getting  her scores, I guess.  So I didn't even see her dance.  And then her fucking face just looks plastic.  Yeah, yeah.  Well.  Completely plastic.  And then when she smiles, her nostrils kind of go.  Yeah, yeah.  She gets those flared nostrils in her.  Nancy?  Oh, she's terrible.  She is the most unsexy fucking thing.  She really, I wonder, did she have shoes on or did she have fucking two things that 
[00:09:00]  look like Kaylee Anthony's body taped to her feet?  I think she's a fucking rotten monster she is.  I think she had two toddlers taped to her feet.  Tots.  Yeah, two tots.  Two tots on her feet.  She was dancing with two tots on her feet.  Yeah, I think our legs too are like really, they just seem to be too short and thick.  Yeah.  Stump-like.  You know, I know we don't have regular people that listen to us in general.  You know, I think we have people that kind of are edgy in their own lives and kind of 
[00:09:30]  look outside the box in general.  I would love to talk to some mainstream people today and go, why the fuck would you watch  Dancing with the Stars?  Yeah.  I certainly would watch the goof on it.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Like, I'm bummed that I tuned in after this Chaz Bono mess, you know, danced.  I'm really bummed I didn't get to see that mess fucking dancing.  Look at that.  But some people are watching going, oh, wasn't she, he, whatever the fuck she is.  Whatever the fuck we're supposed to call it.  Wasn't it wonderful what happened just now?  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  What's wonderful about it?  I don't know.  Someone with a vagina that looks like a man is out there.  Oh, you got it?  Dancing.  Here it is.  I mean, sorry, I didn't mean to sound that excited about it.  There's a better way to fight Flakes.  Garnier Frutis anti-tax.  15 or 30 second commercial.  15, I'm good.  I'm good with 15.  For the love of the Frutis game.  Focus.  Guaranteed.  All right.  Ah.  The cha-cha-cha.  The cha-cha-cha. 
[00:10:30]  His partner, Lacey Swimmer.  He.  Cha-cha-cha.  Oh, God.  You see how she walks.  It's, it's.  You see how she.  You're falling out.  Look at the walk.  It's hilarious.  Are you ready for a friend?  Moves pretty well for a fat man, though.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  As Ty Cobb said about Babe Ruth.  It moves pretty well for a fat man.  Ah, this is.  Fucking, she looks like Ralph Cramden. 
[00:11:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Doing the mambas.  Because she has this, the open vest and the tie.  And the little tie.  Yes.  Carlos.  This is going to bum him out a lot, but I got to say it.  Hard Rock Johnny on Dancing with the Stars.  Oh, no.  Look at the face.  Yeah.  Look at the face.  It's Hard Rock Johnny.  And the genitals.  Oh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Sorry, Hard Rock.  Yeah.  That's pretty good for a big fat zone.  This is pretty goddamn funny.  But why would you watch this? 
[00:11:30]  I don't know.  Big gut.  You know what, dude?  A big guy gut.  Boom.  You just, you take, you tuck your vagina back.  You dance.  Oh, what, dude?  Your mom sings gypsy tramps and themes, dude.  You picked a good song, by the way.  Yeah.  I don't mind that one.  You know what, dude?  You ski.  You don't look where you're going.  Boom.  You hit a tree.  That was hysterically funny to watch.  I'll give you that.  The first dance, the first steps down the stairs, there was something Femi about it. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Did you notice that?  Like, like, Chaz Bona wants to be all man with the beard and the fatness and like the  Ralph Cramden look.  But that first walk down the steps, look how girly it is.  Like, he, he, she can't get it out.  Look.  Look at Son of a, look, look.  Ah, the show has got, it's like a girly thing.  Are we calling her a she or a he?  Ah, it's like she.  She dances like she has a hula hoop around her. 
[00:12:30]  All that fucking belly jelly is just moving around like a hula hoop.  And then the, I guess the dancer's job is to just dance on top of the other person.  Well, pretty much just hold them, do the dance moves, spin them around a little bit.  You try to distract the judges.  Yeah, yeah, by making a look at, oh no.  Look at this fucking pig.  All right, let's see the Nancy Grace.  Wait, wait, wait, back up.  This is Nancy Grace.  This fucking pig.  Nancy Grace is fucking hateable. 
[00:13:00]  I'm not.  Nancy Grace and her partner Tristan McManus.  She's a fucking tranny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She does look like a tranny.  You're absolutely right.  Ah, gross.  Oh, wow.  She's a shitty body.  She just pulled off like a businesswoman thing.  It's wearing this gold, gold lame skirt.  It's Nancy G-Rock.  Oh, she's terrible.  She stinks. 
[00:13:30]  Wow.  She's really bad.  That fucking sphinx hairdo.  Oh, God.  Look at her fucking stump legs.  Oh, what?  Fuck.  She is despicable in that dress.  Fuck.  Hope she falls into a bear trap.  Get your knees and vagina caught.  She looks like she used to do this back in the 70s.  No.  Discoing.  No.  She looks awful. 
[00:14:00]  She really is.  I don't know shit about dancing, but when you see it done well, you know it's good.  Yeah.  She's one of those girls, too.  After a minute, you know she just smells horribly.  Oh, God.  That stank hole.  She should be having a fucking aneurysm in a men's room in Studio 54.  Now she's just walking.  Oh, she's fucking terrible.  She's terrible.  See those arms?  Yeah, big fat arms.  Big fat arms.  Wow.  You twat.  I fucking hate you.  She's just bad.  Let's everybody tweet Nancy about her big fat arms. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, let's do that today.  Nice fat arms.  Nice fat arms, fatso.  I fucking can't stand her.  Wait, what do we tweet?  No, let them.  They're good, man.  These fucking guys are good.  What's her name on Twitter?  Just tweet something about her fat arms.  Fat arms.  Just try to fit Tot Mom in.  Yeah.  Throw Opie and Anthony in there.  Throw Opie.  Casey.  And Jim Norton.  Casey and Anthony.  No, that's fine.  If you got a few characters left, throw our names in there.  Characters.  What?  She's a fucking mess. 
[00:15:00]  Wow.  I don't know why she's so hateable.  Because she's so transparent when she's really just trying to make a hook to make herself  more famous on a fucking toddler's body.  She feeds on the bodies of children.  She's fucking terrible.  She's fucking terrible.  You nailed it.  Yeah.  You fucking nailed it.  She's like It, the Stephen King creature.  Yes.  Pennywise.  Tot Mom.  Ugh.  Tot Mom.  That's the way you talk about it? 
[00:15:30]  Fucking dead baby?  Yeah.  Tot Mom, back in court today.  My giant fat arms will be on camera describing every moment with my droopy giant tits if they  weren't fastened up with the steel girders underneath.  Jesus Christ.  And that horrible chainmail dress she was wearing.  You think she has one of those bras with the big fucking thick butt?  I used to hate those.  Underwire support that's made a rebar. 
[00:16:00]  Oh my gosh.  You knew you were with a tit monster when you had to take one of those off.  It lifts and separates.  Right.  What are you talking about?  Construction equipment?  Fucking that giant titted monster.  A bra should never be that hard.  No.  They aren't even nice big tits because they spread out like past her shoulders it looked  like.  Like she just has a big chest like fucking Arnold did when he was in Pumping Iron.  She's got like a... 
[00:16:30]  Fuck you, Dale.  Fuck it.  She's horrid.  Why am I trying to tag that?  That's hilarious.  She's disgusting.  Awful.  Fucking hate her.  She is a...  I do want to know why people watch this show legitimately.  Who got booted off?  I don't know.  Oh, did someone get the boot?  Tonight is the big vote off.  What is it?  Ron Artest, I guess, is on.  Yeah.  And he was...  I heard on the news he was pretty bad.  Yeah, he's just a...  How could the black guy be bad?  What the fuck?  Well...  I have no faith in anything. 
[00:17:00]  Maybe middle America doesn't like him wielding around a white woman.  Well, that and he has to, you know, do white dances.  Yeah, that's true.  If you let him go fucking jungle, man, he would run the whole goddamn thing.  Freestyle?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Fucking crazy dancing, like at the club.  Is Ron Artest the guy...  He's not the guy that changed his name, right?  So why aren't they using his new name on Dancing with the Stars?  Maybe he signed the contract before they did it and they just call him that.  Maybe they told him, look, we're using your real name, asshole.  We're not using your fake fucking dumb... 
[00:17:30]  Right.  What is it?  What's the name on your W2?  Because that's what we're using on Dancing with the Stars.  Oh, God.  What's he trying to be like?  He's another guy that's very hateable.  And he walks out, the high-energy, fucking amazing-looking blonde.  Yeah, she's pretty hot.  Holy shit.  A couple of the dancers are with...  Oh, God, this is my worst nightmare.  Oh, boy.  I see the help of his lift, his big stupid leg. 
[00:18:00]  His lumbering leg.  Now he's just doing some gangster walk.  He's a fucking athlete.  How is he so uncombersome?  He really is the worst.  Oh, terrible.  God.  It's a new musical on Broadway called Rape.  Jesus.  Wow, she fucking looks great.  By the way, this is how you watch it.  We're like a bunch of fucking ants. 
[00:18:30]  I don't mean A-N-T.  I mean like fucking...  Yes.  Ant nudges.  Ant nudge.  Know what I'm noticing a lot lately?  What?  Nostrils.  And it's driving me fucking nuts.  I'ma make you go crazy.  I'ma make you go crazy.  He couldn't even get a leg up fast enough.  Did you see how off time that was?  Oh, no.  Don't touch.  Oh, leave her alone.  Stop it.  What?  They're just hugging.  They had a good dance. 
[00:19:00]  I don't like that.  Wow.  Let me say hi to Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Hello, Bill.  I just Googled Nancy Grace to try to see that video you guys were talking about.  And there was a site on there.  I think it was people.com.  And her quote was, I don't know how to dance.  He's pushing me around the dance floor like a wheelbarrow.  Oh.  Well, that's pretty accurate.  Full of shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's a bag of shit.  This is a funny quote.  A bag of shit. 
[00:19:30]  She's just a bag of shit.  She really is.  China Phillips is on Dancing with the Stars.  She used to be a looker.  She used to be a looker.  China?  Yeah.  Which one was she?  Ah, the one hit wonder.  Yeah, which one was she, though?  The blonde, the redhead?  The hot blonde.  I know it wasn't the fat one.  No, the hot blonde.  All right.  She used to be a looker.  I kind of liked the redhead one back in the day.  Did you?  Yeah, she was okay.  More than the blonde?  Yeah, I think so.  No kidding.  Yeah, back in what I call the day, though.  Who else is on this show? 
[00:20:00]  I might have to watch.  That was exactly it.  We're just looking up.  That's a poor man's stereo.  Yeah.  Carson Kressley from that gay show.  Oh, no.  Gay Carson?  Yeah.  Does he dance very gayly?  Probably.  We don't need him to watch.  China Phillips, David Arquette.  Elizabeth Ken.  Yeah, she went out with Clooney.  Okay.  That's her claim to fame, and she's like some kind of model from some other place or something 
[00:20:30]  and a TV host.  Hope Solo?  She's a soccer brud.  Okay.  Who, by the way, a lot of people think she's hot.  She's so not hot.  No, not hot.  Stop with that Hope Solo is hot shit.  Yeah.  She's built like a man.  Whoa.  Show the Hope Solo.  Sure.  She's not hot.  Stop with that shit.  That's how they're trying to get us to watch soccer, by the way.  Y'all, look at how hot she is.  You gotta watch.  She's not hot.  Anyone that has bigger traps than me is not fucking hot. 
[00:21:00]  Do you think that face is hot?  It's a little masculine in the jaw.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's go to her photo gallery.  Oh.  Nine.  She has nine pictures.  Nancy Grace had four.  Oh, really?  Yeah, well, she's five more hotter.  Yeah.  Look at it.  That's a man's body.  I can't really tell.  Yeah, they're trying to like take some angles where it doesn't look mainly.  Oh, no, she's all right. 
[00:21:30]  She's probably got like a little yoga body.  Yeah, a little yoga body.  Oh, really?  Yoga body.  With huge biceps.  Yeah, the yoga chicks have weird, very, very long, well-defined, almost ant-like fucking...  Because they're stretching all their shit out.  Yeah.  She's either wearing an amazing sports bra or has zero in the tit area.  Oh, zero.  Soccer bras can't do all that right.  IBTC.  Not with big boobs.  IBTC.  Itty bitty titty committee. 
[00:22:00]  Committee.  Committee.  We used to say club.  No, there was a committee.  Really?  Yes, I had a board member.  Wouldn't you be part of the committee?  Yes, I was part of the committee.  And they're just part of the club?  At Elwood Junior High, I was part of the judging committee for the itty bitty titty committee.  We showed them.  Yes.  We did.  Ha ha.  You think she's hot?  Uh, you know what?  After looking at Nancy Grace...  Well, of course.  It's kind of hard.  I have to cleanse my palate... 
[00:22:30]  Of course.  ...with some sexual sherbet.  This is, uh...  She's not...  You know what?  She's not that bad.  She's all right.  But they're making her sound like she's some huge soccer sexist.  Yeah, she's just on the right.  Let's see, uh...  Let's see a Carson fem up the dance floor.  Are there any clips of him...  There's clips of everyone, Anthony.  ...dancing?  Because, uh...  How does a woman try to dance with a guy like that?  Oh, by the way, as we listen to this commercial, it's Nancy Grace HLN on Twitter. 
[00:23:00]  Oh.  Nancy Grace HLN on Twitter.  Headline news.  Talk about her fat arms.  Yeah.  And her pig face with her obnoxious nostrils.  That's why I said the nostrils thing.  I can't get over the fact her nostrils bother the shit out of me.  Is that him right there in the dress?  Oh.  Oh, no.  It's the other person.  Oh, look.  You know he wants to be in the dress badly, though.  There's...  He doesn't even want to touch her. 
[00:23:30]  Look at this.  Yeah.  He couldn't be gay.  This is what every night in the village is like for him.  Get in the car, make it right when you're...  Except it's a man.  He's wearing a very weird...  Is that like a leather...  Like a leather suit.  What color would you say?  It's light brown?  Yes.  Probably the color of any dick that comes out of his ass.  What?  Jesus.  Let me ask you something.  The whole world is politically...  Probably if nobody would know. 
[00:24:00]  Oh.  Okay.  The whole world is so goddamn politically correct, right?  It certainly is.  Why is he dancing with a broad?  The funky chicken.  Because like Ant said, he doesn't even want to touch her.  No, he doesn't even want to touch her.  So if you're going to get a gay guy, an openly gay guy, and dance with the stars, why  don't you get a male dancer?  You'd be way more comfortable with that, right?  Or at least hooked him up with Chaz Bono.  Or...  Oh, but then there's not a pro in there.  Right.  Because they had to figure out Chaz Bono, and they gave Chaz Bono a girl because he's  a guy.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, I hear you. 
[00:24:30]  Because he doesn't even want to touch this dancer.  No, no.  The touch...  Look at...  He's touching the top of her thigh at the end of the song, and he just couldn't be more  disgusted.  Now he's hugging.  Wow.  People watch this like it's a real show.  But did he femme that up?  Nancy Grace has Patrick Ewing nostrils.  Yes, Kevin from Connecticut.  Yes.  There you go.  What a bunch of fruits.  Just sitting here yapping about Danza with the Stars. 
[00:25:00]  Sweet.  And then I watched Two and a Half Men, and they pulled it off.  Well, they killed off Charlie Sheen's character.  The very beginning was just the funeral.  Right.  With the coffin, and then the chicks that were all bashing him for, you know, treating  them like shit, which was the comic element to the whole thing.  They really have to change the name of the show.  Was that man that was also sitting there, was that the kid? 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Okay, look.  It's now called Three Men.  Call the show Three Fucking Men.  He didn't even look like the kid anymore.  Did they change the kid out?  No.  Because wasn't it a fat little kid?  Yeah.  Now he's got like a Bieber cut, and he looks nothing like he did when he was first on the show.  I don't watch the show, so show me what he looks like. 
[00:26:00]  Season one was good.  The worst, Uncle Paul.  Sure.  He, uh...  I don't think he looks anything like he did.  Yeah.  Is that who it is?  Fucking, uh...  Rivera broke the record.  How great is that?  He did.  See, look.  There he is.  Even if you're not, he's a good kid.  As a fat little kid.  Right?  Look at that catch from the game last night.  That was un-fucking-believable.  You think a book will be written about it?  Uh, no, because it's only the second game of the season. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  If he did that in the Super Bowl, that's a book.  Yeah.  That's a book right there.  Yeah.  Yeah, see, he doesn't even look like that.  Giants win last night?  I don't even know.  Yep.  Giants beat him.  28-16.  28-16.  Even the one all the way to the left doesn't look like he did when he was a fat little kid.  I don't know.  And now he's just a man sitting there.  Yeah, he's...  I think he was shaving.  He's older than that picture we're looking at now, so...  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I heard the ratings were pretty good for, uh...  Well, a lot of people wanted to see...  Oh, of course they're going to be good.  ...how they're going to kill off Charlie Sheen's character. 
[00:27:00]  We'll see how they do, like, five shows into the season.  That's going to be the real test, as they say.  So Rivera becomes all-time save leader at 602, huh?  Yep.  602.  Uh, the question, maybe Travis has the answer.  Whose record did he beat?  I don't know.  Trevor Hoffman.  Oh.  Who did he pitch for?  Uh, San Diego.  I thought so.  Yeah.  When did he pitch?  A couple years ago.  Oh, okay.  He may have retired last year.  Wow.  Okay.  I think.  Mm.  Mm.  Wow.  He's the best. 
[00:27:30]  Well, he certainly is.  And, uh, you know, he's got some World Series under his belt, so...  Just a few.  He's got that going for him.  First ballot Hall of Famer?  Absolutely, yeah.  Oh, you have to, right?  Yeah, he's the best closer ever.  Well, you know what the thing is?  He never got, uh, MVP.  There was a few times I think he was up, and relief pitchers don't typically get it.  But there were times where Rivera absolutely should have gotten MVP.  Yeah.  It's very difficult for a relief pitcher.  I know, but there was a couple of times where Rivera was so fucking devastating that  he should have gotten it, and, uh, you know, he just didn't. 
[00:28:00]  I don't, that's not going to impact his chances to get in the Hall or anything.  Mm-hmm.  Five games up.  Yes.  Five games up.  Yeah, good for you.  Sox still holding it, too.  How many has he won?  Four?  Who?  Four series?  Yeah.  As many as Jeter and...  They should have won more than that.  Ten games left.  That Yankee team should have at least one more.  No.  Ten games left?  You still have ten games?  I think so, yeah.  Football season's going to be half over.  What season?  Jets.  I'm wearing the Jets shirt today. 
[00:28:30]  New York Jets football!  I'm representing.  Yeah, you got ten games left.  I'm representing.  Are they, uh, are they, uh, too well?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Sanchez's got to, like, step up a little bit more, and we'll feel a little more comfortable.  Yeah?  I think.  That's my two cents.  What's his name there, uh, uh, that you were bitching about?  Wound up a little more injured than first suspected.  Uh, Nick Mang?  No, uh, shit, what the fuck's his name?  Jerry Romo.  Yeah, Romo. 
[00:29:00]  Romo's injured?  Yeah, he wound up having, like, a broken rib and a punctured lung.  Went after the second game?  Yeah.  I was, oh, well, we didn't bitch about him this week, because they won, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I just think he's a shitty, uh, wow.  We just think he's a shitty quarterback when the pressure's on.  He stinks.  A little soft.  When the pressure's not on, he's, he's a really good quarterback.  Right?  Tactically and all that, Jimmy?  Yes.  When his ribs aren't cracking and putting holes in his little breathing apparatus. 
[00:29:30]  When he's just allowed to just throw the ball around.  That's what I'm saying.  As soon as there's a little pressure, then it's like,  I'm gonna ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  I agree.  John Cryer is the half man, Jason.  Jason, you are correct.  Oh, that's what it is.  You are correct.  And he's the half man.  He's the half man, really, if you think about it.  Boy, he, uh...  I remember John Cryer.  You remember John Cryer, remember?  When we were doing that broadcast in L.A.  And he was walking around that museum hoping someone was gonna recognize him.  Someone was gonna recognize him. 
[00:30:00]  This is how weird Hollywood is.  John Cryer was at this big radio convention that me and Ant did way back in the day.  And, uh, a bunch of, like, lower-level celebrities showed up at the museum  because they were hoping they could get some press by going on all these radio stations.  John Cryer was one of these guys.  He was wandering around the museum for the two or three days we were out there.  I forgot.  Maybe two days.  No one put him on the radio because no one gave a shit about him.  No.  He was just hoping someone would recognize him from, uh, what was it?  Pretty in Pink, right? 
[00:30:30]  Ah, whatever movie he was in.  And one of those.  And no one put him on and then fast forward a bunch of years and he's on the biggest fucking sitcom going.  Yeah.  He's had a lot of failed shit after all those dumb, uh, you know, teen flicks of the days gone by.  How many years where he didn't really have a hit between Pretty in Pink and then Two and a Half Men?  Pretty in Pink was 1986.  Wow.  That's 25 years ago already.  Holy fuck.  And you can go right to Two and a Half Men.  Maybe.  There might be one other thing in there.  I don't think there's one goddamn thing in there. 
[00:31:00]  No.  Uh, he was in Hot Shots.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh, nothing, right?  No.  Hang on.  One episode of Dharma and Greg, uncredited.  Yeah, see?  Uh, who, by the way, made a guest appearance last night.  Oh, really?  Who did?  Yeah, Dharma and Greg.  Now, here's a show that no one, it's the most forgettable fucking sitcom on television.  And they thought it would be kind of funny to throw them in, like they were coming in 
[00:31:30]  to look at the house, because they were going to try to sell the house.  And they come in, and everyone goes like, woo, woo, woo.  And I'm looking, trying to figure out who the fuck they are.  And, uh...  That's the only cameo they could get?  No, they also got, um, Uncle Jesse.  Oh, really?  Not the Uncle Jesse from the Dukes of Hazzard.  Oh, that's who I was thinking.  What, they'd fucking dig him up if he's got to be dead.  Yeah, yeah.  No, they, uh...  Yeah, you're right. 
[00:32:00]  He went from Pretty in Pink to Two and a Half Men.  He did.  Yeah.  Yeah, we saw him walking around this museum.  And he was just hoping someone would care.  And no one did.  Not even Pretty in Pink fans, because he wasn't really that recognizable from that anymore.  Yeah, no one gave a shit.  That was 1995, probably.  Somewhere around there.  Let's see what he was promoting.  So it was 10 years after Pretty in Pink.  Oh, he was probably promoting Partners, which he did 22 episodes of.  That was the, I think, the bomb. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Bomb show.  That was him and Tate Donovan.  What's, uh, what's, what's going on?  What is here?  What kind of look in here?  Who's?  John Cryer.  Oh, he's going with the spray paint.  Oh, is he?  I think.  I'm looking.  I think that's that cotton candy spray paint shit.  Well, look at this.  You could see this is, look at, look at that right there.  Yeah, you just spray it.  That's crazy.  You spray some shit in there.  And then you look at.  And you fill it up.  You look at him on the show, and it's a lot darker. 
[00:33:00]  That's that spray paint shit.  You think they spray paint?  Remember the guy at AAF?  No.  Oh, my God.  Wait, which guy?  He used to just spray paint.  Oh, fuck, yeah.  Dude, it was like.  He was the sales guy?  Yeah.  We swore he took, like, a piece of cardboard that was cut out exactly for the top of his  head, put it on his head, and just spray it.  Because he actually sprayed a hairline in the front.  He, like, spray painted his hair on.  Remember, I forgot about him until this very moment.  Club Cadillac.  Remember, like, he would go outside, and it would be so hot, and it would start dripping 
[00:33:30]  in his eyes.  He'd be sweating, and this black would just start dripping down his face.  I hear they got this new shit.  If you're doing TV or movies, see, there's spray painting on them.  Yeah, yeah.  But the hair also.  Look at this guy.  Is that the one where it comes out like little cotton candy almost?  Like cotton candy.  Yeah, it's supposed to come out like cotton candy.  It builds on itself.  Look at that.  It's so funny. 
[00:34:00]  What a bunch of.  Does that really look like hair?  Well, I guess if you're doing TV, though, and you got the big bright lights, you could,  you know, cover up the balls.  You could get away with it.  You could get away with it.  But when you start putting that shit in front, no fucking way.  Like, look at the back of that guy's head is completely bald.  They just spray painted it gray.  They just painted his head gray.  Yeah.  I remember using that same paint when I was painting my Saturn V rocket.  I believe the lunar module.  Look at this guy.  This guy's got a mullet.  Worst hairdo ever, this guy.  He's got a skullet. 
[00:34:30]  He's got this.  The babes are back, he says.  Oh, wait.  Can we start this over?  Oh, my God.  It's a 1990s infomercial.  And the brothers.  It's not just for men.  Yes.  Start that out.  GLH means great looking hair.  Great looking hair.  Does it?  No, yeah.  Just spray GLH on and it instantly covers your bald spot, leaving you with great looking  hair.  No.  GLH.  And ladies with thinning hair or bald spots, GLH solves the problem instantly.  Yeah, so to pull it.  GLH is not a paint or a cover off.  No.  It's an amazing powder that clings to the timeless hairs on your head.  Oh.  It actually builds on itself, leaving you with great... 
[00:35:00]  Come on.  He just spray painted his hair on.  This guy's head looks like I'm fucking the side of a train.  It's the first time I ever use this product.  I've signed on the infomercials and I was skeptical at first, but it works.  It still works.  I can't believe it.  This guy's got nothing in the back.  And I...  Now he's just got...  A scalp is now great.  A new guy now.  And I tell you, I'm really impressed.  No, you're not.  Oh, this guy. 
[00:35:30]  I've been getting a razin for being bald.  A razin.  A razin.  A razin.  I've been called old man, but the babes are back.  The babes are back with your mullet.  And GLH is not just for men.  What?  Unbelievable.  Oh, Jesus.  When are they going to show a woman?  Her hat should be removed in a vestibule.  That's why that guy did it.  She got fucking just for men all over her hat.  The hat store was angry. 
[00:36:00]  Then brush after using the finishing shield and you're done.  And with GLH, there's no problem with rain or when working out.  What?  How the fuck you get it out of your head?  This is great.  Warhol.  Get up.  Ah, it works in Spanish, too.  I saw GLH about four months ago.  My father told me I'd never grow any more hair.  Hey, MS, look at me now.  I cut his white throat in the alley and left him to bleed to death.  And he's on his way to Mexico to help his friend sand his boat. 
[00:36:30]  Wow.  That's a good one.  God damn that Ron Popeil.  Ronco.  He put out a lot of shit.  He made a fortune putting out utter and complete shit.  Is he alive still?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Know who isn't?  Who's that?  Dolores Hope.  Hey, Dolores.  Hey, welcome to heaven.  Is she dead, huh?  Well, I thought she was dead years ago. 
[00:37:00]  I did, too.  102.  Bob Hope's wife.  102.  102.  Yeah, that's got to be...  You know, Shatner was doing that roast last night.  He's in his 80s.  Yeah.  Doesn't look it.  Well, 102 is a far cry from 80s.  Yeah, you think?  Yeah, that's a big 20 years, I think.  From 80 to 100, what?  Every year is like seven years?  Yeah, at that point, it's just...  Yeah, it kind of...  Each year becomes more years on your organs, I think. 
[00:37:30]  Mm-hmm.  Like, that's what just happens.  Your organs just say,  Wow, come on.  I've been pumping and fucking doing what I'm supposed to do  since you flew out of a vagina.  It's 100 fucking years later.  Machines don't last this fucking long.  And you're a pile of pulsating goop.  And as soon as you fall out of a vagina, you start dying.  Yeah.  You do.  Yeah.  You start rotting.  I don't think...  Is there an actual period where you're not dying?  I don't know.  I've heard you're growing and, you know... 
[00:38:00]  So maybe after puberty, you start dying?  Yeah, I think after puberty...  So maybe that's not accurate.  I would love to...  That's it.  We should ask Dr. Steve.  How many years...  Wow.  How many years on this planet are you walking around  where you're not dying?  Before you start...  Like, before things start failing...  Right.  Before cells start dying and skin cells start losing their elasticity...  You can't count skin because that's always, like, dying, right?  Yeah, but that's...  There are certain things with skin that happen. 
[00:38:30]  Like the cells underneath start breaking down  and that's where the wrinkles come from  and the elasticity goes away, the hair changes,  like, and that's the road to death.  Right.  And destruction of your body.  Gray hair, that's all dying shit.  Oh, yeah, it's all dying.  Wrinkle?  You lose pigment.  Wrinkle, that's dying shit.  Dying, dying.  Eyesight, you don't see as well.  That's dying shit.  Fucking teeth.  A little cavity, that's actually dying shit.  Everything.  You're just dying. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  A little less.  Dying.  What?  Exactly.  Wow, we're on it.  It's just not working.  We're rocking it today, brother.  Oh, forget about it.  That's two.  Fucking amazing.  Keep track, that's two.  Chemistry is back after 10 fucking years.  Stop.  Of going away.  Holy shit.  Just fucking around.  It's brutal.  These are all just fucking stupid jokes.  Can I tell you something about skin really fast, though?  And maybe we got to get Travis in on this.  My kid, three days ago, 
[00:39:30]  and I try to keep the kid's shit to a minimum.  You know that.  This kid gets this nasty scratch on his fucking face  from, like, the tip of his eye right here  down his cheek, okay?  Cool.  Right.  I don't even know how.  Action hero, look.  I don't even know how it happened.  I was babysitting the kid when it happened.  I don't know what he fucking did.  Let's go fathering, but okay.  You ready for this?  And Travis is going to relate  and a lot of parents out there.  Within 24 hours,  there was no more fucking scratch. 
[00:40:00]  Just gone, right?  And it wasn't a tiny little, like, okay, you know,  what the fuck is going on with baby skin?  That's why you gotta,  you must drain them of their blood and drink it.  Is that stem cell shit?  I don't know.  There's shit going on.  It is creepy how quickly my kid's scrapes  and bruises go away.  It's like, what the fuck is in this kid right now?  I bet up to a certain age,  you could chop a finger off  and it grows back like a lizard tail.  Just like a lizard tail.  It's all that milk. 
[00:40:30]  You think it is?  His breast milk starts sucking on them titties, boys.  Travis, you know what I'm talking about, right?  Oh, yeah.  She'll get, you know,  scrapes on the knees all the time.  It is creepy how quick it goes away.  Someone's saying.  Almost overnight.  Well, in this case, it was overnight.  That's hilarious.  What did he say?  Someone goes,  it's jerky jerk.  Says, Opie, you have twins, you idiot.  The kid's fucking fine.  And then the next day,  you gotta scratch at the same place.  Holy shit, that's funny. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, that is really.  What the fuck do I?  Maybe I did.  You don't know.  Now I'm gonna think about that all day.  Shit.  It was switching out on me.  It's pretty fucking,  it is fucked up.  Kids just get,  they got this shit going on,  this kid shit.  I remember we had,  it is.  I remember we had somewhere to go  and the kid had like,  something going on in his face.  I'm like,  that sucks  because I know a lot of pictures  are gonna be taken.  I forgot what event it was.  They're all the same event after a while.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden,  we get down to Philly  and the thing,  and it was gone.  Like,  what the fuck?  That fucking, 
[00:41:30]  what is that?  Stem cells?  Is that where all that stem cell shit comes from?  Maybe that's like what they're trying to like.  Where they know this shit is just amazing  when you're younger?  Yeah.  They got something in their fucking genetics.  It's really creepy though.  In that baby DNA.  Yeah.  It's like a vampire when they get cut.  They just look at you and it heals  and they go,  That's pretty much it.  Same thing.  Yeah,  pretty much it.  I wonder how we,  is science,  I guess I should say,  trying to figure out how we could use that  to our advantage?  Well,  the South Park with Christopher Reeve 
[00:42:00]  eating,  eating the spines.  What was it?  It was just biting into babies' fetuses.  That was hilarious.  And he got out of his wheelchair,  he's walking around,  just biting baby fetus necks  and sucking their blood out.  It was a thing,  you know,  for stem cell research.  It was their way of saying  that stem cell research  is kind of a good thing.  Oh,  fuck.  Sam just gave us  all the roast,  I think.  Cam.  Tyson, 
[00:42:30]  three minutes and 45 seconds.  William Shatner,  four minutes and 20 seconds.  Amy Schumer,  three minutes and 55.  I want to hear Amy.  Patrice,  five and a half minutes.  I want to hear Patrice.  I thought we were just  going to do a few jokes.  Yeah.  What are we going to do?  Are we going to do the whole set?  The whole set.  Yeah.  You didn't want to do  individual jokes,  Sam?  I think Oprah's saying  that he's not happy  with the way you lazily  cut up the...  I don't care about  anything anymore.  It's fine.  It wasn't lazily.  Far be it for me  to interrupt a comedian's set, 
[00:43:00]  but I just figured  we could pause it  or whatever  if you wanted to.  All right.  Because, you know...  All these are good sets, huh?  Yeah, those were  the strongest ones.  Well, I mean,  the Mike Tyson one  and the William Shatner one,  I figured.  I guess what we should do  is...  Can you help me out?  Yes, I can.  I would like to play  Amy Schumer  and Patrice O'Neill's  sets clean  because they're  friends of the show.  Sure.  And then maybe...  Could you give me  just a couple of the jokes  that killed  from these other three guys?  Yeah.  Is that cool? 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, do you in a break.  All right, we'll do that.  Oh, here's the episode.  Cells of the body  are damaged.  They are the most  powerful thing  on the planet.  And how does someone  like yourself  make use of the stem cells, Chris?  Well, it's very simple.  He just...  You gotta explain that.  He just snaps  the fetus' neck  and he's sucking  the inside of the fetus out.  And now you can see  my arms have better movement.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  Larry King.  But why don't they  even try to do  Larry's voice?  They don't have to.  They've never had  to do an impression  to someone.  No, they just said  anyone can even  just sound like this.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  But that was fucking  so shocking  when he first...  He just pulls  a fetus up,  snaps its neck open,  and sucks  its innards out.  Amazing.  All right, we'll break  and we'll do some  Charlie Sheen stuff, right?  Charlie Sheen.  Who's coming in today? 
[00:44:30]  Jeff Dunham, nice.  Yes.  Last time he was in,  he was great.  And the real news,  by the way,  is the uncut version  of The Shining.  You see that?  Why are they screening  that in Rochester?  I mean, I lived up there.  Maybe they have  a copy of it.  What's the dillio  with that?  Two extra minutes.  Two extra minutes?  But at the very end, yeah.  At the very end?  So why don't they  just show the two minutes?  Why do you have to  sit through the whole movie  to get the last two minutes?  Ugh.  I'm being serious.  It's hard to see that  in a movie.  I mean, the actual Shining.  I've never seen it  in a theater.  I'd love to see that  two minutes. 
[00:45:00]  Rare uncut version  of The Shining  to screen in Rochester, New York.  Do we know anything  about these two minutes?  I do.  Yeah.  You do?  So why don't we  fucking talk about it?  It's in the article.  I didn't read the article.  Let's see.  But I'd do that for you.  I would say...  Spoiler alert.  Spoiler alert.  If you care that much.  I would say  Jack makes it  out of the maze.  He goes up  to the snow cat  and says,  I'm sorry  for all the trouble 
[00:45:30]  I've caused you, honey.  Fixes it.  And they all drive back  to Maine  or wherever they were.  No.  What happens is  Grady comes out  and he goes,  I was joking.  Now that's an ending.  That would be terrific.  Grady comes out.  I guess that's it, huh?  Yeah.  They actually...  No, what happens is  they zoom in on that picture 
[00:46:00]  at the end  and it's not a photo  of Jack Torrance.  It's just a cuckolding scene  since the early 1900s.  The alternate trailer  is the funny one.  Can we see it?  The skiing  would be fantastic.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck, I want to see that.  It's got all nice music  to it and everything.  Yeah, that's a good one.  What's happening?  So...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, oh, oh.  Gregorio.  Okay.  This is the alternate?  Oh.  It's the comedy one.  Meet Jack Torrance. 
[00:46:30]  I'm outlining  a new writing project.  I love this thing.  He's a writer  looking for inspiration.  Lots of ideas.  Some good ones.  Meet Danny.  No, I hate Mr. Torrance.  He's a kid  looking for a dad.  There's hardly anybody  to play with around here.  Dad.  What's up, Doc?  Jack just can't finish his book.  I don't want to sound  melodramatic,  but there's no way  to make it  economically feasible.  Here's to five  miserable months.  He's walking into the room, 
[00:47:00]  the kid.  He's just around the corner.  Of course.  Wow.  It's the...  I'm your new foster brother.  I'd do anything.  How they turned it  into a rom-com  is amazing. 
[00:47:30]  I could see  the city light.  My heart going  boom, boom, boom, boom.  There's not one horrific part  in this whole scene.  They're all like...  He's at the party dancing.  Shiny.  That's fucking...  How does it only have  19,000 views?  That's hilarious.  That's probably only  one thing.  Yeah, there's many versions.  Oh, has that been around  for a while?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  We did that.  That really started  on the alternate trailers  that everybody did.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the first one.  That's the best one.  Yeah, that's great. 
[00:48:00]  Do we trust a listener today?  Yeah, we're still in.  Oh, boy.  You want to go for  trust a listener?  Oh, boy.  You want to play  trust a listener?  Do you want to play it?  I hate trusting listeners.  You want to go?  It's up to you.  We can play  trust a listener.  Oh, God.  It's really up to you, Ant.  Yes, or...  You know my opinion  of the listener input.  Yes, or...  Let's go with a yes  just to hear what it is.  We're going to  trust a listener today.  All right.  I'm going to regret this.  Travis, look up  the Dumb and Dumber  horror trailer.  Oh, boy. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, God.  This is romantic comedy.  Is it?  You decided it.  You decided  to trust a listener.  This has nothing  to do with me today.  Why?  You decided.  Hello.  How are you?  I'm black from white.  I drove to the airport.  It should be the Aspen  out of my life.  I'd show you  what a real man can do.  And Carrie  looking completely insane.  We belong together. 
[00:49:00]  You hear me?  Remember me?  They put the flashes  of light in  and the drum  in between the cut scenes.  That makes it creepy.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  It's terrible.  It's clever.  It just makes me  want to watch the movie.  That's true, yeah.  Thumbs up for Dumb and Dumber?  It does look...  It's a great movie.  It doesn't get old.  I've never seen it.  Really?  You've never seen 
[00:49:30]  Dumb and Dumber?  Oh.  But I know what happens  in The New Shining.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, Jimmy.  Yes.  What's the end?  Jack comes back in  out of the cold.  Yeah.  And he starts  running around going,  Where's my hat and mittens?  And the ghost skim to him  because he's cold.  Cold.  I didn't mean to damage  the snowcat.  That's what the new version is.  Yeah.  It's actually...  The new version begins  at the very end  and then the whole  final two hours  is him dealing 
[00:50:00]  with the insurance company  and he's trying to explain  that he didn't damage  the snowcat.  And they're saying  that that's not covered.  A man with an axe  chasing his wife  is not covered.  Right.  I just want to  have the snowcat  paid for.  We don't cover that, sir.  You took them  and you jiggled them  with your hand  in a self-satisfied manner.  He really did.  It doesn't cover it.  The insurance company  will not cover that.  And a negro scratched it 
[00:50:30]  driving it up north.  Yes.  All that trip  just to get an axe  in the fucking tummy.  That whole long trip.  The flight.  He was there  with his big black toes  just sitting watching television  with his horribly tacky  nude black women  pictures on the wall.  Actually, I know  I don't want to blow it  but I'll tell you  the extra two minutes.  Yeah.  Wendy and Danny  get to the bottom  of the hill  and they see  Larry Durker  stiff-legging  around the shop 
[00:51:00]  because he has to shit  and the bathroom  door is locked.  Larry Durker  just sucks.  No mention  of what happened  because he comes  he doesn't ask  where Scatman Crothers is.  He's just trying  to get into the bathroom  because he accidentally  locked it.  And he's afraid  he's going to shit  down the back  of his fucking snow pants.  Now that I'd pay  to sing. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, shit.  Creepiest song  ever used in music?  Amazing.  In movies?  This one's pretty creepy.  When they're driving  up that road.  Love this.  Got that great  steady cam  on a helicopter shot.  A piece of music  or a song  in a movie  that's creepier  than this?  The Exorcist music  is pretty fucking creepy.  Which one?  Do you got an example?  Yeah, and there's a scene  where it's playing  and the nuns are walking  in the beginning?  It's called  Tubular Bells, 
[00:52:00]  I think.  The Exorcist?  Exorcist, yeah.  Yeah, but is that one  creepy?  Yeah, this is funny.  This fucking gives you chills  right when you hear it.  Very creepy.  Right when you fucking hear it.  Very, very creepy.  Yeah.  I guess because you know  the context.  This could be uplifting  and nice.  The other one  sounds frightening  in itself.  This doesn't,  but knowing the context.  Which is worse?  Yeah.  As a music piece.  Standalone music piece.  Shining, yeah,  I think so.  You're right.  This could be  an uplifting piece 
[00:52:30]  if you don't know  what it is.  Yeah, that's true.  It's kind of  tink, tink, tinky.  The other one's just  There's no mistake  with the Shining.  Horrible sounding  fucking song, yeah.  We got another one?  Yeah.  This is just  fucking creepy.  How good is that, though?  I wouldn't be able  to listen to this  at night  in a dark room.  Oh, I'd love to.  That's how creepy  this is.  Nah, I'd be all scared.  Yeah, I would, too.  I'd be scared.  Yeah.  Fucking good, man.  Great party!  I think this is  the best opening 
[00:53:00]  theme music ever.  I've never heard  a better opening theme.  It's a nice, sunny day.  They're taking a ride  up into the mountains.  Yeah, it's not even  a horrible picture.  It should be pleasant.  Yeah, other filmmakers  were making a rainy day,  a cloudy day.  Yeah, it was nice.  It was nice.  It was a beautiful  fucking fall day.  It's okay.  He saw it on the television.  You know they're going...  Did they eat each other up?  I like when the kid  asked that question.  That Danny...  Tony's in your mouth,  I said.  You know they're just  driving into a dreadful place 
[00:53:30]  by this...  You're right.  The sunny day.  Was it...  The only one mistake  Kubrick made,  you could see  the helicopter shadow.  Oh, the shadow, yeah.  Oh, you can?  At one point, yeah.  And I guarantee you  that drove...  I guarantee you  he thought of that  on his deathbed.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking thing.  And he probably  had no choice.  I could have  CGI'd that out.  In later time,  I'm sure Kubrick,  we all know,  did a million fucking takes  and a half something like that  in one of his films.  It probably drove him nuts.  It must have driven him nuts.  I didn't know that, Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  If you watch the opening scene,  you'll see the helicopter shadow 
[00:54:00]  a couple times  or one time at least.  It's like,  why is a helicopter  following the torrences  up to the...  What about the Omen?  What was that music?  You got the...  Well, the Omen  had some scary music.  ...  Was that it?  Was it Charleston?  We're watching the opening  and it just opens  on this fucking  crystal,  beautiful,  clear lake.  But he makes it look  creepy.  What a great shot.  Yeah, I think it's  the best opening scene ever. 
[00:54:30]  It's, uh...  Yeah, and then it's like...  I'm describing everyone's  seen it.  Where's the helicopter?  That's all I care about.  You'll see it  as it gets closer...  Shadow.  Actually, if you look  at which way  the sun is shining,  you can see that  it's from the rear  of the helicopter very very far away on the car zooming in from above yes driving up that mountain  you'll see it you should see it shortly on the mountain side now you were kind of zooming in  behind the car closer that is a steady-ass shot oh he's the the greatest camera 
[00:55:00]  work ever there yeah how do you do it it's hard to do that back then especially i mean  that helicopter is low to the ground who invented something like that uh oh there's  the helicopter bottom bottom right hand corner he actually this was pretty much the advent of  the steadicam there was a handheld oh but they didn't need that he could have caught it right  there yeah no no no he wanted that shot no but i mean cut as soon as the helicopter no but yeah  he could have cut it in a couple seconds uh after and just the way the credits are rolling by i think 
[00:55:30]  you see it again though uh look how close they get that car that's that's just a great shot right off  the cliff i think you see why would he leave that in there i don't know why he would leave it because  it looks like he could have cut it out unless it was just unless that's the only shot of it um maybe  he felt that a helicopter could be flying it's not that crazy but to me it takes away from the sense of  isolation with him there was probably 20 other things in that piece of the shot that he loved 
[00:56:00]  yeah and that's psychopathic head of his true i think they could have done something with uh  did you ever answer that question i don't know i'm curious natural lens flare by the way  none of that jj abrams let's throw fucking lens flare at everything i'm gonna i'm gonna start  making home movies and just throw lens flare in it lots of like hey look i'm here at my house and  just lens flare we uh should break because jeff dunham's gonna be here before we get some other 
[00:56:30]  done and i want the omen music when we come back oh yeah you have it real fast i'm just curious i  don't remember it that was just  yeah it's just creepy is this the the main song from the omen i don't remember that's what it said  online yeah ave santani is the main theme of the omen um i don't know the movies i don't remember  this can you forward a little bit it creak is a kick i remember this okay it kicks in this is rather 
[00:57:00]  creepy especially you know there's a little devil boy knocking things over yes little devil's come  i don't remember i don't like it it's pleasant all right this was my wedding song  it was mine too oh chip  let's hit that break and uh i don't know we'll do the the charlie sheen roast stuff uh next day there

[01:09:30]  it's all squished too and there's a certain element of centrifugal force that is attempting to throw  us off the planet yet it's being um negated by the gravity that we also feel so if the earth  stopped the gravity itself would pull us in and we'd all i think be like squished against the earth  i think not sure it's like what i do if a girl tells me my cock is small i'm like you ought to  see this puppy on jupiter it would just be pulling your dick down oh your balls would hurt though on

[01:25:30]  but no i mean charlie you get a bad rap but you're just like bruce willis  you know you were big in the 80s and now your old slot's being filled with ashton kutcher  but all joking aside if you ever need a friend to pee in a cup for you  i'm your gal thanks for having me  give me 
[01:26:00]  jeff dunn i'm in studio anthony  I see.  And there's Jimmy.  Walking back into the studio there.  Oh, man. 
[01:26:30]  Have a good piss, Arnold?  Yeah, why?  That's one of my favorite lines from Fast Times.  Oh, that usually means you missed something bad, though.  Like something awful happened.  Well, Jeff Dunham was talking a lot of shit about you.  Fair enough.  I didn't want to say it live on the air.  I always do.  I don't blame him.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Pull your side and talk about it after the show, but if you need to know.  It's a new bit in my act.  Yes.  We'll play some clips from your show.  And just dissect them.  That's like if you walked in, we're just pounding on the material that you knew that you're proud of. 
[01:27:00]  It stinks.  How great would that be, though, to actually do that in your act?  Like to have a fucking, to just show a montage of comics you hate and really explain to the audience why they're just killable for laughing at this shit?  Wouldn't that be satisfying on some level?  Have you ever gone to a comedy club and seen on the wall bad things written about you?  No.  That hurts.  Wow.  Oh, damn.  This was early, early on, too.  It was like in frickin' Oklahoma and a couple places like Oklahoma, no less.  You go on the one seat, you know. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, it's just all.  Damn.  It's like, what the hell?  That's not nice.  Do it on stage.  Don't do it on the wall.  Do they do it anonymously or with their names at least?  Oh, no.  They usually sign it.  Oh, they do.  They usually sign it.  You've got to respect that they signed it.  It's only a couple.  Yeah, of course, they could have been signing for somebody else.  But is it some local guy that's just bitter?  You know, I honestly can't.  He actually turned into a name, and I can't remember.  I specifically made myself forget.  What the hell's that?  I can't remember who it was.  I'll remember it in a little while.  Yeah, you should show him your bank account.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Robert Kelly.  Yeah.  You know what it is? 
[01:28:00]  It's because you're a ventriloquist.  People think that it's hip to attack a ventriloquist.  And probably the guy who trashed you probably never saw the act.  I don't know.  Could have been one of the ex-dummies.  Who knows?  I don't know.  Who cares?  That would drive me nuts, though.  Fucking being bashed by the comics would annoy me so much.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah.  I don't understand that.  I try not to kill the comics if I can help it.  I try not to.  Jimmy's usually pretty good at that.  There have been comics we've talked about,  and Jim won't say anything, 
[01:28:30]  but he'll make faces like...  Unless I have a reason to bash them,  then I just kind of feel bad.  Jimmy will give us the thumbs up or go harder.  Yeah.  Jeff Dunham, Controlled Chaos,  this Sunday at 9 on Comedy Central.  Yeah, yeah.  It's cool.  And they did a couple promos during the roast last night,  which was cool.  I thought to have Tyson there was all right.  I mean, it was like he was drunk off his ass  by the time it got to him.  Yeah.  And it was unintelligible.  When he was talking,  but I don't know. 
[01:29:00]  I thought it was kind of cool having him there.  I just get mad that there's some spots taken up  by guys that aren't really comics.  Right.  You know, like Jim Norton should have been on the damn thing.  Right.  And he wasn't.  And certainly a few other guys I could think of.  Yeah.  Off the top of my head.  And instead, you got Tyson.  Yeah.  No offense to him,  but Steve-O's been doing, you know,  comedy for less than a year.  He gets the big spot up there.  Yeah.  I mean, this was a huge show.  Everyone was watching.  Yeah.  I don't understand why they do that.  Why not just get the funniest guys out there right now  and just, you know, go balls, balls out.  I had so many good roast jokes written, too. 
[01:29:30]  You did, Jim.  All right.  I was going to go up there and just go,  Charlie, what's with all this coke?  Tss.  Is that what you do?  Yeah.  Tss.  I would have killed.  I would have laughed.  I would have laughed, see?  I would love to have the balls to do what Norm MacDonald did  at the Saget roast and just go up there  and try to make one guy laugh.  All Norm cared about was making fucking Bob Saget laugh.  Yeah.  It was great.  And the comedians fucking went nuts for it, of course,  and the audience was like,  The audience was like, 
[01:30:00]  What is he doing?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I didn't see that.  I didn't see that.  Oh, he said something about Geraldo.  He goes,  Something about,  he's got the eagle eyes and something.  Oh, fuck.  Like, I'm fucking it up,  but the punchline was,  This man's for the birds.  Because it was like two bird things in a row.  It was fucking the oldest lady joke ever.  This man's for the birds.  Yeah, they were awful jokes he was telling.  Terrible.  On purpose.  People were cracking up.  On purpose.  Yeah, Norm doesn't care.  So what's the special about, Jeff?  The last one I did was a Christmas special, 
[01:30:30]  and that was 08.  We filmed it in June of 08.  And it aired that Christmas,  and that was it.  And I did the book,  and so I've had two and a half years,  three years to work on this thing.  And, you know,  Occupy the Dead Terrorist  kind of just took off a few years ago,  and the touring's been wacky.  Going to other countries  where English is the second language,  I was really worried,  how's this going to work?  And the weirdest one was Paris, France,  because they hadn't had a,  God darn it, 
[01:31:00]  I can't remember the name of the theater.  Famous theater had been there forever.  What was the name of it?  Olympia.  Oh, the Olympia, yeah.  Olympian, Olympia, Olympia.  That way they used to have can-can girls?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  I keep looking over here,  it was very toxic,  it was only my right ear work.  If you hear something stupid,  it came from that side.  I got it, all right.  You want to have better headphones for Mr. Donham?  No, no, I'm fine.  You all right?  So I thought,  how's this going to work  with all the frickin' people in Paris?  How's the comedy going to go over? 
[01:31:30]  And they said,  you know,  the last comedian on stage we had here  and we loved him  was, of course,  Jerry Lewis.  Jerry Lewis.  Enough of Jerry Lewis.  All the French  and the Jerry Lewis thing.  Enough already.  So I'm like,  when was this?  When was the last time  an American was on stage here?  It was Jerry Lewis.  And they said 1971.  I'm like, what?  And they loved Jerry Lewis  and then they loved me  and I'm like,  well, I don't know  if that's good or bad.  Yeah, you don't want to be  the guy that the French love  for some reason.  Exactly.  Does anyone know why  they love Jerry Lewis so much? 
[01:32:00]  Has it ever been explained?  Have you ever seen  The Nutty Professor?  My theory is  they think all Americans  are like that  and it's a fucking subtle jab at us  that they think like,  blah, blah, blah.  That's what Americans are.  Just dumb and loud.  Fucking idiots in France.  Why would they like prior?  Oh, so it would be like  someone coming over here  from France  and acting all cowardly  and afraid to fight  for your country.  And we'd be like,  that's how they are.  Exactly, constantly opening  the door for Germans.  Go ahead, you go ahead,  you go ahead, you go ahead.  That's actually a great idea.  Actually, that could work.  And I'm not kidding 
[01:32:30]  that one of my next characters  I'm thinking of doing  is an angry French mime  that won't stop talking.  Okay, see?  You can laugh at both things.  The French  and the fact that a mime  is talking.  Yeah, but I asked,  I got on stage and I go,  how many people think in English  and how many people think in French?  And it was literally split  down the middle.  So, and then you go  to these other countries  where English is a second language  and they get everything.  They know all the nuances,  all the American comedy.  You know, they watch our TV.  They get the YouTube stuff. 
[01:33:00]  So, I don't know.  It's kind of weird.  How big was the theater?  That one had to,  boy, I don't know  what the Olympian is.  I don't think it was  more than 4,000.  That's a lot of fucking people  in another country, though.  How do you, what do you do?  Do you track YouTube hits  and you can see like a lot of them  were coming from that area?  Well, here's, yeah, exactly.  And the YouTube hits  and the Google, you know,  the Google Trends  is an awesome page.  What do you got,  a few hundred thousand views  on your videos?  Yeah, that's it.  Did you have one of the  top YouTube videos  of all time?  I don't know,  or something like that.  It was up there for a while.  How many million? 
[01:33:30]  No, it's up to,  that one clip,  I can't remember,  we're up to,  no, that one clip  is up to like 145 million.  That's hilarious.  But the, wait,  hold on, Judy,  what are the clips total to now?  Wow.  The number of hits,  it's in the,  it's in the billions.  Yeah, it's close.  It's stupid.  Good for you, man.  Because we used to,  no, what happened  was when Spark of Insanity  came out,  all these clips  from the special  started being posted.  And like every comic dreads,  you know,  your whole act  is now on freaking YouTube. 
[01:34:00]  So what do you do?  So we started,  you know,  we have a good relationship  with YouTube  and because it was,  you know,  it was a DVD,  we could legally  get it taken down.  But then this one clip  comes along,  the Achmed one,  and I noticed we'd missed it  and it had 11 million hits  in a very short amount of time.  And I'm like,  wait a minute,  this is,  am I being stupid here?  This might be some kind of advertising.  So I kind of embraced it  like the Grateful Dead  and I thought,  well,  let's just leave up a few  and see what happens. 
[01:34:30]  And it was like,  it exponentially exploded  because it went to all our military  around the world  and they'd send it to friends  and then people in other countries.  And then we started tracking  what other countries,  the number one country,  even more than the United States,  was South Africa.  Really?  Yeah,  that was weird.  So we toured South Africa.  They need some laughs down there  to tell you the truth.  Well,  yeah.  And when we went there,  we had to have five  fully armed Israeli,  you know,  ex-military guards with us  because, you know,  there are a few threats  here and there.  Yeah, sure.  Threats?  I don't know.  Terrorists are angry  when you have a terrorist puppet,  I guess. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah,  they don't like terrorist puppets.  140 million views,  by the way,  yeah.  Holy shit.  At least you didn't annoy  them having Israeli guards with you.  At least that would calm  the terrorists down.  Wow.  It would really be a joke on you  if you got captured  and they just beheaded the puppet  and let him go,  you know.  And they didn't do it  to be ironic?  They're just not educated well?  No, no,  they couldn't really figure it out.  They were very upset  with the puppet,  but not you.  Right.  That's fucking,  a hundred and something million.  You're smart to leave that up,  though.  It's like,  it's just, 
[01:35:30]  it's got you all over the country,  all over the,  I can't think of where,  all over the what,  the fucking earth.  Maybe the world.  I think there's a few comics  like yourself  that it's okay  your material's out there.  You know,  it's like listening  to your favorite band  and you want to hear the songs.  Brian Regan,  same thing, man.  Right.  They know his act,  but they don't give a fuck.  They can't wait to hear  the cup of dirt bit again  or whatever.  Well, see,  that's the kind of thing  that I'm in right now.  The special's coming out on Sunday.  I've been working on this material  for two and a half years.  So it comes out,  it's, you know,  it's, it's well honed.  You know,  I've done it hundreds of times  and now it's going to be on TV. 
[01:36:00]  So now what do I do?  It airs on Monday.  What do I do for the show on,  uh,  it airs on Sunday.  What do I do for the show on Monday?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  So it's like the band,  you know,  you want to go see the,  you want to go see your favorite band.  You want to hear the hits,  but at the same time,  if they do all the same stuff,  it's like,  well,  I've seen all this.  I've heard all this.  So it's kind of a balancing act  of what do you do?  You know,  do you have any stuff  that bleeds over  that you haven't done  on either special?  Like if you had two hours of material,  you burn 90  and you maybe have 30 left  that you can kind of play with.  Well,  what we did, 
[01:36:30]  we went back through,  I have four Comedy Central specials now.  We've gone through all those DVDs  and we've gone through  and found out  what was on the cutting room floor  that we cut out  that I forgot about  that I just stopped using  because I assumed  it was on the special.  So now I'm going through,  but instead of it being  this old material,  instead of being like  a well-worn pair  of familiar jeans,  it's like a well-worn pair  of smelly jeans.  Yeah.  Because it's like,  I remember that joke.  It was good four years ago.  So yeah,  now I'm furiously writing  and preparing  and trying to do 
[01:37:00]  some new stuff.  People are wondering,  why is Jeff pulling  out an OJ puppet?  Not even though long.  With a disgusted look  on his face.  Like,  people,  I have to do this.  Wait a minute,  it's not a joke.  I do actually have  the Judge Ito puppet.  Are you right?  Yeah,  because when the trial  was going on,  a magician friend  came to me  and he said,  you know,  they're bringing in  performers for the  sequestered jury.  And I'm like,  really?  So my folks  contacted Judge Ito  and I said,  can,  you know, 
[01:37:30]  they said,  can Jeff,  and they said,  yeah,  sure,  yeah.  So they took me  and they wouldn't,  they said,  we'll call you  an hour before the show  and tell you where to go  because they weren't,  they wouldn't tell anybody  where the jurors were.  So it ended up being  like the training  facility for cops  in Fullerton,  California,  something really wacky  like that.  So,  but,  but,  uh,  before that,  I thought,  I'm going to really  get ready for this.  And so I actually  built a Judge Ito puppet.  I go,  this will kill.  All these guys will love  this.  The jury got a Judge Ito puppet.  So I started doing it  on stage. 
[01:38:00]  It got on a couple of the,  you know,  a couple of the tabloid  television shows.  And,  um,  but when I walked in,  they said,  okay,  before you do your show,  uh,  you need to,  we got to go through  the act joke by joke  to make sure there's  nothing inappropriate  or won't reveal anything  to the jury that they  haven't seen.  So I had to go through  it joke by joke.  And they were like,  it was six deputies  sitting there.  Yeah.  Critiquing my act.  And then we got to  the Judge Ito puppet  and I pulled him out  and they went,  no.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  So it's going to  prejudice the judge.  A juror is one like that.  But wait,  here's my first joke. 
[01:38:30]  How about that  murderer OJ?  How about that  obviously guilty guy OJ?  No?  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah.  Wow.  They didn't let you  use the Ito puppet.  No,  Ito puppet.  But we,  I got to talk to the,  uh,  the,  the jurors afterwards  and after you left,  there you go.  There's no way in hell  that this guy's going  to be convicted.  Oh,  you know,  right?  Oh my gosh.  One of the alternate jurors,  this is no joke,  I'm not embellishing  here at all.  Uh,  one of the alternate jurors  comes up to me, 
[01:39:00]  blonde,  blue-eyed,  typical Southern  California girl  and she goes,  oh my God,  when you pulled out  Peanut,  I was just tripping.  Ooh.  We the four missions.  Ooh.  Yeah,  okay.  Yeah,  so,  you know,  DNA,  yeah,  I'm sure we could  explain that to her.  How was the show?  It's actually pretty good.  They were very,  they were very nice.  The deputies laughed  and it was like,  too many didn't know  the outcome.  You could have just  bombed on purpose  just to give them  a miserable night. 
[01:39:30]  I never knew  that shit went on  for sequestered jurors.  They actually bring  in entertainment.  Yeah,  but then they were  taking them to  the Lakers games.  It was just,  it was the oddest thing.  Wow,  that is really strange.  I just constantly  picture them  bickering about  the case  to each other  in a room.  In a stupid hotel room.  I think you ought to.  Yeah.  I think they moved  them around  a few times,  though.  Yeah.  Oh,  yeah,  that was a biggie.  How long were they there?  Nine months?  Oh,  yeah,  that was a crazy long time.  That was a long time.  A long time.  Hey,  a lot of Jeff Dunham 
[01:40:00]  fans checking in.  Holy shit.  John,  go ahead.  Hey,  Jeff,  I'm a big,  huge fan.  I saw you in  Beaumont,  Texas before,  but I got a question  for you.  How come the peanut doll  that you sell there  at the show  doesn't look like  peanut you use on stage?  You can blame  the Chinese for that.  Can't sew together  something?  You know what?  We're working on that.  We actually have  a new one coming out  that,  are you talking about  the stuffed one  that's all soft?  He's gone.  He's gone.  What's he talking about? 
[01:40:30]  Oh,  you know,  we have merchandise  and stuff,  and one of my favorite  things is we have  little dolls of peanut  and Ahmed  and Bubba J  and Walter.  And so they're,  and now we've  done it better.  The peanut one  was all stuffed  and it's really hard  to take a plush toy  and make it look  what are you laughing at?  That guy really bugged me.  How come the peanut doll,  I want to do an impression  for the girl I have  in the well  in my house.  One and a peanut doll.  Are you going to make one,  would you? 
[01:41:00]  What a fucking  buffalo built creep  that guy was.  That's a whole other  part of the business  because we have  these images  and we give them  and then the company  that we work with  farms it out  and they send it to China  and the Chinese artists  have to then sculpt  the face  or make the face  and it's like  I get these things back  and I go,  how can you even think  that this is even close?  And the guy explained to me,  I go,  why does Walter look good?  He goes,  because for some reason  they can do the more  chiseled looking face  like an Arnold,  they can sculpt an Arnold. 
[01:41:30]  But when it comes  to something soft,  everything ends up  looking Chinese.  I probably just think  we all look alike.  That is kind of odd.  I was like,  what?  This looks just like  what he gave me.  What are you talking about?  Ahmed was perfect.  Do you make your own puppets?  Oh yeah.  Still to this day?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  In fact,  you're quite the artist.  Do you know what  a 3D printer is?  Oh fuck no.  Okay.  This is what I love  about the DVDs now  is on this DVD  coming out for the special  we have nine extras  on this thing 
[01:42:00]  which is nuts.  And when somebody else  is bankrolling  the specials  when you get to  a certain level  then you get to  be a little more imaginative.  So I thought  if Ahmed came to the United States  and started falling in love  with the Western culture  and he made some money  what would be  the first thing he'd do?  Well,  he'd go and have  a hot rod built for himself.  So we actually had  this big hot rod built  and it's  remember the rat rods  back in the 70s  where the monster 
[01:42:30]  sitting out  you guys are looking  at me like I'm nuts.  Anthony might remember.  I might.  Yeah.  Give me a little more detail.  Big giant tires in the back  tiny tires in the front  big huge engine  on the front  In the front  where it was like  the old slingshots  where you had to sit  behind the engine?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the stick shift  sticks out of the roof.  Anyway, okay.  Anyway, we had this  I'll show you.  I think I saw it  on Smokey and the Bandit once.  Yeah.  Anyway,  so we had this  giant hot rod built  for Ahmed  and we're using it  in the special.  I'm going nowhere with this.  Who cares? 
[01:43:00]  Now we all need to see it.  Okay, never mind.  No, go ahead.  No, no, fine.  It's fascinating.  It's really funny.  Okay, never mind.  There's the hot rod  that we have built for Ahmed.  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.  So my whole point on this is  I don't build the dummies  like I used to anymore.  It's a 3D printer  and never mind.  I don't know  what I'm talking about.  No, I saw a special  on those fucking things.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Do you have a 3D printer?  A 3D printer.  What it is,  you have a three-dimensional object  and some kind of CAD program  on your computer, right?  So let's say you have 
[01:43:30]  the YouTube video  that's going around now  is a wrench.  It's a crescent wrench.  Right.  Right?  So it's a 3D model  on your computer  of a crescent wrench.  You push the button.  A few hours later,  you pull a crescent wrench  out of the 3D printer.  And it works.  Right.  And it works.  Functioning.  The little knobby thing spins  and it's a three-dimensional thing.  Yeah, yeah.  But wait a minute.  It's like Star Trek.  Where do you put,  first of all,  what are you going to do  with a thin wrench?  No, no.  It's actually got bolts to it.  It's three dimensions.  But what is it? 
[01:44:00]  Just fucking drop into a thing  like when you order a soda?  It drops.  Okay, here's how I explain it.  Okay, let's say you take an apple  and cut it into layers this way,  right, horizontally.  Right.  So you have a bunch of layers.  You take those layers.  Now you start.  You take it all apart.  Now you put one layer down.  You then put another layer,  another layer,  another layer.  Eventually you've built the apple.  That's how a 3D printer works.  It builds layers  ten thousandths of an inch thick  of whatever material  it's building it out of.  But what material goes in?  Yeah, thank you.  Mine is the cheaper one.  It builds it out of ABS plastic. 
[01:44:30]  So you've got this ABS plastic wrench.  But my point is,  I took a bobblehead of,  and this is all in the DVD.  I took a bobblehead of Achmed, right?  I scanned it in 3D.  So now we have a 3D thing  in the computer of Achmed, right?  I then hollowed out the scan.  So now we have a hollowed shell  of Achmed's head that's this big.  I then expanded it by 400%  and printed it.  So I printed a head of Achmed this big. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, which in essence  came from a small bobblehead.  And now on that car that you saw  is now the air intake  on top of the 1951 Hemi engine  on the Achmed mobile.  So wait, can you watch this thing?  Where are the layers being done?  Is it inside your printer?  In the printer.  The printer looks like a big refrigerator.  So you can't,  can you watch it being done?  Oh yeah, it's got a window.  It's got a window.  So anyway, on the DVD  is me doing this  and showing this giant Achmed skull 
[01:45:30]  being built in three dimensions.  Amazing.  How the fuck they figure that out?  But now, here's the other thing.  Mine does it in ABS plastic.  Oh yeah, now they're building things  out of titanium.  They're building things out of flesh.  They're creating organs  built in material  that won't be rejected by the body.  It's unbelievable.  When I saw that,  I was like,  get the bug out of here.  Right, it's like freaking Star Trek.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so anyway,  so now I got this giant printer  and again,  on the DVDs,  the extras, 
[01:46:00]  so now I'm starting to build my dummies  with the 3D printer  because now I go in  and I just sculpt them  on the computer  without having to use any clay  or any crap.  Jeez, man.  So you sculpt it  and then you hit print  and now this head comes out this way.  Wow.  But now my goal  is to be able to print things  that...  Yeah, exactly.  You can do that.  You can take the scanner  and you can go around your head  and print your own head.  Oh, you have a scanner  that actually...  Oh, okay.  But my goal,  because it prints things  that mechanically will function  when it comes out,  it creates the innards, 
[01:46:30]  all the...  An MIT graduate student  did a CAT scan  of a cuckoo clock.  CAT scan meaning  all the internal workings.  He hit print  and it spit out this...  Hours later,  it spit out a working cuckoo clock.  Hung it on the wall,  pulled the thing  and it worked.  Like all the pieces work,  all the little gears,  everything is actually made.  Because there's a malfunction  and every time the hour hit,  fucking bullets fired up.  He put a gun in there  by accident.  It's like a brundle clock.  More importantly, 
[01:47:00]  did he get an A  in that class?  Yeah, yeah.  It was a strong C.  Yeah, yeah.  That's fucked up.  Dude, that's amazing.  It is amazing.  Yeah, it's wacky.  So anyway...  You're actually using it.  You're not just using it  as a novelty,  you're actually using it  professionally to make...  And to make puppets.  Yeah, to make puppets.  Which is amazing.  Now see,  that's the other thing  is that the company  that takes what they...  There's a software company  that you can cat scan,  let's say, 
[01:47:30]  anything.  Anything,  that bell right there,  mechanical bell, right?  They'll cat scan  that mechanical bell.  They then take their software  and they can disassemble  that bell  part by part by part,  right?  And then you can print  those parts  and now you have  that mechanical bell  and you can either  assemble it yourself  or have the printer  assemble it, right?  As it's building it.  And they have all  military applications.  So I come along  and they can't...  So they can't...  They can't take  any of their stuff  and show it to anybody  because it's all  military stuff.  Yeah.  So I went to them 
[01:48:00]  and I said,  you want to do this  with a dummy?  And they go,  oh, this is perfect  because now  it's a real world  application of an  amazing technology  and we're going to  be making a video  of us building  this dummy  that actually  you can pull  the dummy head  out of the printer  and it'll be working.  You know what  a great application  for that is also?  Let's say,  and for the military  or the space program,  if that ever gets  off the ground again.  No pun.  It's very hard  to take parts  with you everywhere,  every part you might need. 
[01:48:30]  Let's say something  breaks down  in the field,  you need a part  for your tank.  You then would  tell them what you need,  you get the scan  sent electronically  to you  into your computer  as long as you have  one of these  in the field with you.  Instead of a thousand  trucks of parts,  you could then  build the part,  whatever it is,  install it on the vehicle  and now you're  off and running again.  And one of the printers  that'll print in titanium  and other metals,  it's a quarter  of a million dollars.  But think about it  on Apollo 13  if they'd had a little printer. 
[01:49:00]  They could have  literally sent them  the thing and...  It's like,  hey, we need another,  you know,  oxygen tank and...  Imagine if they made it  where you had to plug it in  and it just didn't work  in the field.  Some basic flaw like that.  Someone didn't think like,  oh, damn.  It's a six-inch cord.  Does anybody have something  with a ground adapter?  You don't have  the ground adapter.  And they're doing organs now?  Yeah, it's a different  type of technology,  but it's the same thing  where everything's built  in layers  and they're actually  growing organs.  But what they are doing now 
[01:49:30]  is, like somebody  needs an arm replaced  or a hip replaced  or whatever,  you can do a CAT scan  of your current bone.  Oh, I ruined about  all this from Leno.  I'm not dropping a name here,  but...  What's he,  cloning cars?  That's what he's doing.  That's exactly right.  Blast the car around.  Cloning money.  No, listen,  this is how he does it.  I go into his garage, right?  He invites me over.  I get to go over.  I see all these cars.  So we're looking  at all these  unbelievable vehicles.  Then he shows,  oh, yeah,  it's a 3D printer.  I'm like, the what?  And he goes, 
[01:50:00]  it's a 3D printer.  I go, what is that?  And he explains it  and he goes,  come on,  look over here.  And they're like,  wait, wait, wait, wait.  I want to keep  going back to this thing.  What they do  is let's say  he has the Duesenberg  and on the front of it  it has the left what's it.  It's missing  the right what's it, right?  So he says  he can go to part yards  his entire life  and never find  the right what's it  to the 19-whatever Duesenberg.  So they take  the left what's it,  they scan it,  in the computer  they reverse it,  they print it out,  now they got the right what's it.  Spits out the right...  And you saw it?  That's what Jay does?  He's just printing cars?  He's printing car parts. 
[01:50:30]  He had some sort of tractor  that had a water pump  that they could never duplicate it.  So they scanned the water pump,  it had holes in it from rust,  they repaired it  in the software  on the computer,  they printed it out  in ABS plastic,  gave it to another guy  who then made a mold  and made it out of metal.  Amazing.  Wow.  It really is  just an amazing thing.  I've never heard of this  until today.  I've heard of it  but not that it worked this well.  It's going to change  the entire world.  There's going to be  machinists out of work, 
[01:51:00]  there's going to be  all kinds of people  out of work  because it's going to  replace all kinds of stuff.  It's literally  like faxing somebody  a piece of hardware.  Something like  a bunch of the plastic stuff  that you buy at stores now  are actually printed  by these printers  and not as prototypes  but as actual things.  That will actually hurt  the trucking industry  because things won't  need to be shipped.  They're transporting them  like Star Trek, yeah.  Right.  Wait until the flesh  ones are good though.  Big dicks won't mean  anything anymore. 
[01:51:30]  Just make your own.  How long did it take  to turn this amazing machine  into something  that had to do  with his dick?  Great with that, babe.  Except you can't make  it a lighter heel.  Wow.  That's wild.  And what made you  actually decide  to go like,  hey, you know what?  As far as my business goes,  I should pick one of these up.  Because it was literally  the dummy thing  because it was like,  because I have to sit there  and sculpt in clay.  I'm teasing. 
[01:52:00]  I love Jay.  Stop.  I had to sit there  and sculpt in clay  and, you know,  like hands, for example.  Making freaking dummy hands,  you got to make a mold  and let's say  it's a little bit too big.  Let's say you make a hand  and it's 20% too big  for the dummy.  Well, now what you do  is you go and you click  in the computer,  20% smaller,  click,  six hours later  you've got another hand.  In the old days  you had to like  re-mold the hand.  Yeah, you got to make it  out of clay,  you got to make the mold,  you got to cast it.  How much does it cost?  Wow, that's great.  The one that I have  that prints in ABS plastic 
[01:52:30]  and the largest it'll print  is 10 by 10 by 12.  So this giant Achmed head  we had  was six pieces  to make the big head.  So I had to put it  in six pieces.  But that machine  cost about 30 grand.  I would have thought more.  Yeah, I would have thought more too.  That's not nearly as much  as I would have thought.  Right.  But the ones that print  in other materials,  like I said,  in titanium  and different metals,  it's a quarter of a million bucks.  But you can literally  build your own tools.  Did you just smile  when that thing came to your house?  Like, oh,  I am going to just play with this.  Like, oh boy. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, what else did you make?  That's like a great toy, man.  Like, oh.  What else did you make, Jeff?  Come on.  I was doing all...  You made some weird stuff.  That's some weird stuff.  Come on.  No, I haven't made anything weird yet.  Poor cat being scammed.  Oh, see, that's weird.  You take a CAT scan of an animal,  and they've done this.  They'll take a CAT scan of an animal,  print it,  and you can literally  put it on a table saw,  cut it in half,  and all the things,  all the innards are there.  All the organs, 
[01:53:30]  the internal organs.  That's so weird.  You have a bunch of animals  like Gage from Pet Sematary.  They'll eventually figure that out,  but they're going to miss something.  Yeah, just off just slightly.  You don't want to fess up?  What did you make  with your 3D printer?  Did you just start looking  around your house  and go,  I'm going to make that?  Hot Wheels car,  this is really boring,  took a Hot Wheels car,  scanned it,  and then printed it way bigger.  That's kind of cool.  That sounds cool.  Come on.  We all grew up with Hot Wheels.  I also knew that.  Yes. 
[01:54:00]  Did it work?  Oh, yeah.  Did you get a nice big orange truck?  Yeah, it was like this big.  It was a Red Baron that big.  Yeah, that's a lot.  And then I took an Achmed head  and made it this big.  A little tiny one.  What does the plastic look like,  the hunk that it's going to be  building stuff out of?  Is it just a solid thing of plastic  that it cuts or laser cuts?  Oh, no, no.  What it is,  it's on a spool  and it's almost like,  it's like Weed Eater,  the size of Weed Eater wire.  You know,  this plastic stuff on a Weed Eater. 
[01:54:30]  It literally looks like it.  So it's on a big spool.  There's also what's called  support material.  That's on another spool.  And what it does is  it's just a print head  and it literally looks like a printer.  But it's going back and forth  and all around on the platform  building this thing layer by layer.  So it just melts this ABS plastic  at 500 and something degrees  in layers.  And it looks like frosting  when it's coming out.  As a guy,  you could sit there  and drink a beer  and watch this thing.  Yeah, just like,  this is amazing, man.  This is amazing.  Yeah, you need that window. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so they knew,  they probably built the first one  without the window.  They were like,  nah, we got to put the window in here, man.  People are going to want to see this.  I would so start smoking pot again  and look through that window.  Making a wrench.  I swear to you.  Making a wrench.  So.  That is amazing to me.  So that's my point.  If you'd like to see how this works,  get my DVD.  Yes, see?  You know what?  You just sold a lot of DVDs.  I think you just sold a lot.  That's a very cool extra, though,  to put on there.  Yeah, man.  No one would know.  You know, 
[01:55:30]  you see you work in the puppet  and just think,  I don't know how they made it.  Well, A&E Biography's doing a thing on me, too,  and we're doing the same thing  with building A.J.  Achmed Jr.,  who's also on the special,  and how I went through building  Achmed Jr. this way  with the printer  and building his head  and the whole thing.  But it shows us scanning it.  But that's on A&E,  but it's also the Achmed Mobile  on the DVD.  You bring any of the puppets today?  I brought Walter.  I don't think we've ever seen 
[01:56:00]  one of Jeff Dunham's puppets.  Oh, come on.  We had Walter last time,  did we?  No, man,  because we just started  talking like this.  Oh, we did?  Which is good, yeah.  We just wind up doing  that talking shit.  You know why that's better  is because when you come on  a show like you guys,  it's like last night  watching The Roast.  It's like, you know,  it's cable and it's edgy,  and you guys aren't used  to normal radio anymore.  I'm sitting out there  listening to you guys  going, holy crap.  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, how do you do this?  We actually scan the show  the day before.  Yeah, we actually scan 
[01:56:30]  a lump of shit  and we just  layer by layer  until 10 o'clock.  We spit the shit out.  We do start  with a pile of shit  every morning.  Jimmy's absolutely right.  So my show,  my show,  my audience is a little  more tame than what you guys  are doing.  I just want to see  the puppet.  I don't want to put  the pressure on you.  I got Walter.  Yeah, I hope to see that.  You got the video  of the wrench being made.  Yeah, that's insane.  Now, that's a different printer.  That one prints  with a powder, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It was like a powder.  How good are you  on computers?  Because I'm an incompetent. 
[01:57:00]  I would never be able  to navigate this.  Well, you're scanning  a lot of it, Jimmy.  You can't fuck up a scan.  But I could, though.  And there's so much more  to it than this  and the percentages.  I guarantee you have to  really be good  at computers to do this.  No.  No?  No.  It's more,  it's more,  I mean,  this technology's  in its infancy.  It's like,  you know,  the scanning.  The scanner is  a little 3D scanner  and most scanners  are unbelievably expensive.  The little 3D scanner  is only like  two and a half grand.  When the cost comes down  and we all have this.  Oh, I guarantee you.  There's now  little ones like  that are 2,000 bucks 
[01:57:30]  that are this big  that the resolution  is low and all that.  But every guy  that has a shop  in his house  will have one of these things.  Yeah, yeah.  This is where  DVD players were  in the early 90s  when it was $2,000  for a DVD player.  Now they're down  to what,  30 bucks?  When do you think  we'll all have flesh ones?  Because again,  the technology,  I keep thinking  of Ray Kurzweil,  it just keeps  perpetuating.  You were just thinking  about what you  would normally do now  when you email  a girl a picture  of your penis.  You can now send her 
[01:58:00]  the actual penis.  But you know what?  I'm thinking though  you wouldn't have  the flesh ones  in your house  because you couldn't  do the surgery.  But if you need  a lung or something  like that?  Why am I explaining  what you're using for?  Because that would be  more hospitals.  Yeah, what a dope  I am.  I didn't finish  to explain.  What they're doing now  is let's say  you have a bad hip.  They'll scan the hip,  your hip.  They'll then take it  in the computer,  fix it to what  it's supposed to be,  then print out  whatever part needs  to be replaced  and boom,  there it is.  Holy shit.  And it fits you  exactly because  yours is exactly  the same thing.  That's great. 
[01:58:30]  My luck at being there  and they go,  oh, it's out of ink.  Look at that.  It's a little hazy  on one side of my liver.  This is the third liver  we've made you this year.  Can you just change  your habits?  Yeah, we knock it off.  Exactly.  He just hits the button  and the printer's like,  we know.  Should we scan it?  No, we have it here.  We have it on file.  So if you want me  to get a Walter,  I'm happy to get a Walter.  Oh yeah, yeah.  Let's check him out, man.  That is kind of cool  and I like the fact  that you do make them  because that's  a whole other talent.  Yeah, I started that  when I was back in college 
[01:59:00]  and it was out of necessity  because there are guys  that build dummies  but...  Do you guys ever go to break?  Do you guys ever go to break?  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  Break is a very rare.  No, I just ask  because if you want to see  a picture of the head  being printed,  I got it here.  Why don't we do that?  We'll take a break.  We can continue with Jeff Dunham.  And then we'll pull Walter out too.  And we'll pull Walter out.  All right, yeah.  The special though.  Jeff Dunham, Controlled Chaos  this Sunday at 9 p.m.  on Comedy Central.  Yep, and the DVD  goes on sale on Tuesday  but they can pre-order it now  at Amazon.com.  Controlled Chaos.  And your website's what? 
[01:59:30]  Just Jeff Dunham.com?  Yeah, and one interviewer  actually yesterday said,  so your DVD  Controlled Chouse.  Oh, no.  Is that Shane 45?  Oh, no.  I can't.  More with Jeff Dunham.

[02:00:00]  The big Comedy Central special  Controlled Chaos  this Sunday at 9 p.m.  It's Jewish and it's chaos.  Chaos.  Chaos.  I want to ask you,  so you mold your own puppets. 
[02:00:30]  I don't think we've ever  asked you this before.  Have you ever come up  with a puppet  that you've never told  anyone about  because you realized  in the planning stage  this is the dumbest idea ever?  You know what?  I honestly think,  like I said earlier,  getting back on the road  next week after the special airs,  I've got to come up  with new stuff.  For every character  that's succeeded,  there's a couple  that I call  it's my trunk full of  what I call  what the hell  was I thinking?  So I could have sworn  we talked about this  last time.  If we did,  I apologize.  It's okay.  But you know what?  Our audience got 
[02:01:00]  so much bigger  since the last time  you got here.  We're here,  so they're here  We're like goldfish.  Yeah.  I forget it really.  Yeah,  they have to remind us.  You already talked  about that.  Oh,  and you even had  the guy in the studio.  Oh,  we didn't know.  I've been recently.  400 lead singer.  And you do.  You go home  and do you absolutely  forget what you talked  about today?  You have no idea?  Yeah,  there are some days  that go by  it's just like,  I have no idea.  By noon,  I forget  I'm even doing radio.  I have people  come up to me  after the show  and they go, 
[02:01:30]  oh yeah,  yeah,  I saw you  four months ago  and so and so  or two years ago  and so and so  you picked on me.  I was the guy  with the red hat.  Yeah,  oh right,  yeah.  Sometimes you actually  even have to go like,  oh yeah,  yeah.  Right.  Knowing it's like,  do you remember  what I said?  It's like,  look,  I said yeah  to make it feel good.  Don't call me out  now and quiz me.  How about the ones  where the people  tell you what you did  and you know darn well  they're wrong  but they tell you  what you did.  My favorite one  is how many times  I've been congratulated 
[02:02:00]  on how well I did  on Star Search.  Oh really?  I was never on Star Search.  Never on it.  You think you're Taylor Mason?  Yeah,  exactly,  but they'll argue with me  and go,  oh you were great  on Star Search  and I'll go,  well thanks  but I was actually  never on Star Search.  That was my first,  those were my first responses.  Now I've learned  just to agree with them.  Yeah,  yeah,  it makes it easier sometimes.  Yeah,  but first I go,  oh no,  oh yeah you were.  No,  and one guy got mad at me.  I'm like,  I really,  I wasn't like,  yes you were.  I go,  no,  you were on  and you talked to Ed McMahon  and blah blah blah blah.  So anyway, 
[02:02:30]  so back to your question.  It says right here  on your Wikipedia.  What does it say?  You were indeed  on Star Search.  It's got to be true.  You've got to trust  those Wikipedias.  Maybe you're wrong.  My manager is sitting  right across the room here.  You know,  Jeff,  you're wrong.  Oh boy,  you were on Star Search.  Better get that brain checked.  Judy's just throwing credits  on there.  It doesn't matter.  Jack Parsho.  Jack Parsho.  Our show of shows  or your show of shows.  Better make a 3D copy  of that brain of yours.  So anyway,  my favorite bad idea 
[02:03:00]  was in the early 80s,  I had this  Jose the Jalapeno  on a stick.  Jose Jalapeno on a stick.  And this talking food thing  was working out.  And I thought,  well,  all right,  let's go in that direction.  So I came up with  the ethnic talking food.  I said,  okay,  how about Tony  the talking Italian meatball  on a plate of spaghetti?  So that was one  that I didn't build.  I had someone else  make that one for me.  And I still have him.  And the woman  made him,  and this is a soft puppet 
[02:03:30]  because I don't build  the soft ones.  I build the hard ones  like a dummy.  So she made this thing  out of cloth,  but he's on a frisbee,  upside down frisbee  on fake spaghetti,  giant meatball  the size of a basketball,  right?  And he had one joke  that would work.  And I would say,  do you speak Italian?  Italian?  And he goes,  no.  And I said,  why not?  And he goes,  I don't have no hands.  So,  oh,  yeah.  She's a meatball.  Thank you.  So,  thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:04:00]  You brought him on stage?  Oh,  yeah.  Right.  And then the second bad idea,  I don't know what I was thinking.  This is when I was in a show  called Sugar Babies  with Mickey Rooney.  It was a Broadway show.  I was doing the bus and truck show.  It was around the country  with Mickey Rooney.  What years was that?  Oh,  man.  85.  All of 85.  Damn,  I remember that one.  That's pretty cool.  Mickey Rooney and Ann Miller.  I was not in New York.  I was not in the Broadway,  but I was on the  National Touring Company.  So it was with  Mickey and Ann Miller. 
[02:04:30]  You didn't know  that weird things  were going on  behind the scenes for him,  right?  Like,  apparently he's being  beaten up in his house.  Yeah,  something.  I don't know.  Yeah,  elder abuse.  He came out recently.  He said he was getting  like abused all these years.  Oh,  come on.  He came out with that.  Yeah,  he did.  Came right out and said it.  By who?  I don't know.  Yeah,  you never said who,  right?  Oh,  who was beating him?  Yeah,  I don't know.  I don't know what he said.  Mickey Rooney was the  little fireball craziest  genius I'd ever met.  I mean,  the guy was absolutely nuts.  And to carry on a conversation  with Mickey Rooney  was just to sit there 
[02:05:00]  and nod.  He would never stop.  He was in his late,  middle 60s when,  I think that's when it was  earlier middle 60s  and the guy was nuts.  So then my second bad idea  was I'm embarrassed  to even say this,  but I had a,  I just thought this was  a great idea.  The same woman made an egg  this big,  three feet tall.  I'm not even going to say this.  No,  you have to.  No,  this is great.  It was an egg.  You've had so much stuff  that's worked.  Come on.  We all know you're a billionaire, 
[02:05:30]  basically.  Meat ovary.  And please remember,  this was middle of college years.  I named him  Eggelbert Humpty Dink.  Nobody's looking at Jeff.  Nobody's looking at me.  So did you bring,  did you bring Eggelbert on stage?  No,  I actually did bring him on stage.  But it was when I was  with Mickey Rooney.  The old Jewish people loved it.  The funny part is the meatball,  like I'm thinking about like,  because again, 
[02:06:00]  we all try ideas that don't work.  Like it's part of writing stand up.  But when you have,  when you bring something out,  like,  and it's a,  it's a whole thing.  Like I'm going to bring out  and you present it.  Right.  How long into it do you know?  Like with a punchline,  you can just kind of bail on it.  But when you have this thing,  how long into it do you know?  Like,  this is a mistake.  Well,  that's a kind of a tough responsibility now  because we're doing these big theaters.  People are paying huge money  for these tickets.  So you can't experiment.  You can't let it go too far.  Right.  So when I come up with a new bit,  I'll lay it,  of course,  in the middle where it should be. 
[02:06:30]  So I'll open with,  do strong 20 minutes  and then I'll bring this thing out  or new jokes or new bit,  do it in the middle.  If it doesn't work,  I quickly move on to something else.  Okay.  But if it's a new character,  I always tell the audience,  I go,  look,  this is something brand new.  So it helps it out.  I go,  you guys are going to help me out.  If you like this laugh,  if you don't,  please boo.  Oh,  okay.  Oh,  really?  Oh yeah.  So,  and if they don't like it,  they just,  you know,  they don't laugh.  Good for you.  How'd they feel about Egglebert?  Oh God,  that was,  I don't know what I was thinking.  Yeah.  You should bring that back 
[02:07:00]  and goof on it  and go,  I don't know what I was thinking  and you should bring out  the meatball thing  but tell them what you're doing for it.  That's very funny.  I actually think  the meatball thing could work.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Cause it's so stupid.  It's just ridiculous.  And I would introduce it as that  as one of my bad ideas.  But then if I came out,  it's all in the material.  If I came out with great jokes,  I don't know.  I do think the angry,  the angry,  angry mime  that won't stop,  angry French mime  that won't stop talking.  That to me is laugh out loud.  I think that is funny.  Yeah.  And he just hates everything. 
[02:07:30]  Look,  I'm in the box.  I'm in the box.  You're not.  So,  that's funny.  Yeah,  that's funny.  That dumb box thing.  I want to see the puppet.  Oh,  you want to see Walter?  Oh yeah.  I want to see Walter.  Dude,  I'm literally,  he's got the box open,  the case underneath the desk here  and I'm terrified  I'm going to spill coffee on it.  So I keep,  I won't even drink my coffee.  I'm afraid I'm going to spill  a $200,000 puppet.  God damn,  that's famous.  Yeah,  that is like,  that's more famous than you, 
[02:08:00]  Jeff.  Hold on.  I'm going to get it set  the right way.  Hold on.  Oh yeah,  the arm's got to be folded.  Do you travel with that case  and you can't carry that on,  right?  Oh yeah,  I carry it on.  Oh,  you do?  Oh yeah.  Hold on.  Do they check them and everything?  Prostate?  Jeff,  can I take a picture?  I know you don't want video.  Yeah,  no,  it's good.  It's good.  I can do that or whatever.  That's cool.  Good morning.  Good to see you guys.  Thanks for having me  on your lovely show  and I've been listening  and I understand  I can actually say fuck. 
[02:08:30]  Yes,  you can,  Walser.  No,  that's a profession.  Yeah,  so whatever.  I would do jokes,  but do you want jokes?  I don't care.  Yeah,  let's hear a joke.  Oh,  good.  Oh,  good.  I'm having a bad day.  Yeah,  I just found out  my wife did not  run off with anyone  from Journey.  Thank you.  Because you know  what happened,  you know,  okay, 
[02:09:00]  good.  Yeah,  he,  whatever the hell that is.  Well,  that went over well.  Do another one,  asshole.  So that's Walter.  That's,  yeah,  that's awesome.  I don't even,  has it just become  second nature  to move the eyebrows,  look down,  do the,  like,  do you even have to think  about what you're doing  with that anymore?  No,  and what's funny  is with like doing TV  or even doing radio,  we'll sit there  and we'll be talking  about other stuff  and it just kind of  becomes second nature 
[02:09:30]  where,  yeah,  like the head  will just be moving  and like the brows  go,  because I'd be like,  okay,  he's got to move his mouth,  now his eyebrow,  make him go up,  make him go up,  turn his head around.  We have a ventriloquist  convention every year  which is kind of frightening  and this year  was the biggest one  we've ever had.  We had 525 people  show up for the thing  and,  you know,  a handful of the folks  have been doing it  a long time  and are professionals  and then there's  the weekend warriors  that do maybe  one show a month  and they're the  frightening ones  and to see somebody  who hasn't done it long, 
[02:10:00]  you kind of,  it's like doing stand-up.  When you see,  when you go to  open mic night,  you forget how hard that is,  how hard doing stand-up comedy is.  Does it bring you back?  Yeah,  and you see somebody  do it poorly  and you're like,  man,  I forgot how hard that was.  Yeah,  it's kind of,  but when a 10-year-old kid  comes up to me  and says,  I want to learn ventriloquism,  I think that's great.  It's when the 30-year-old guy  comes up to me.  So how do I get started  in the business?  It's like,  have you eliminated  every other possibility?  I'm sure you don't have  these sets anymore 
[02:10:30]  because you bring it  in your own audience,  but it's like once in a while,  after you've been doing  stand-up,  you'll have a set,  like I had one  in this little club  where I bombed so badly,  I was like,  oh,  that's why people  are afraid to do stand-up.  I couldn't dig out of it.  Oh, really?  That's it.  Nothing I've learned  in 20 years  dug me out of it.  I just bombed.  That happens  at a corporate gig.  Corporate gigs sometimes,  I've had those corporate gigs  where they don't care  who you are.  You know,  now,  for me,  people are buying tickets,  they want to laugh. 
[02:11:00]  But at the corporate gig,  they've got,  you know,  there's the hundred guys there,  they've been playing golf all day,  they've been in the hot sun,  they have a big meal,  they've been drinking,  now they have the awards  or the speeches,  and now,  now,  gentlemen,  in the evening,  we have a puppet show.  Ah,  yeah,  yeah.  Right.  So that's kind of where  Walter came from  is because I kind of  wanted to meet him  at their own level  because he doesn't want  to be there,  they don't want to be there.  Screw you,  let's get through this.  I like how you talk, 
[02:11:30]  but his head's still  moving around.  Like he's in the room.  And I feel the same way  about you.  Thank you,  sir.  It looks so lifelike,  doesn't it?  It really is crazy to see.  Creepy.  Because you don't notice,  you notice when someone's  doing a bad job,  but you don't notice  when someone's doing  a good job  because it just looks natural.  It's crazy.  It's amazing.  You know how happy I'd be  if that fucking puppet  just bit Sam's face?  And the ventriloquism part, 
[02:12:00]  now obviously many years,  but what got you  started on that?  You figure,  hey, look,  I could talk with my mouth shut.  I was in the third grade  and I got a dummy.  I literally was walking  through a toy store  like in November  of that year  and I saw a dummy  on the shelf  and I picked it up  and I showed it to my mother  and I said,  Mom, look at this.  What do you think?  She goes,  yeah, whatever.  And I didn't think  anything about it.  And then a month  and a half later,  there it is  under the Christmas tree  so I just went  and got books 
[02:12:30]  and started teaching myself  and there was no reason  to quit.  I was a little bit chubby  and no good with the girls.  I was not popular.  I was horrible at sports  and so now I found this thing  that I was able  to make people laugh  and damn.  It really is all  about the girls though.  It really,  that's what gets,  for everyone,  it's amazing  what gets you noticed.  Whatever makes the girls  not just run away nauseous  is what we stick with.  That's great.  And of course,  through high school  and elementary,  high school and college,  of course,  the guy with the puppet,  yeah,  that's the chick magnet  right there. 
[02:13:00]  Screw the football player.  Someone's saying  that a puppet,  damn it.  Someone's saying  Walter sounds like  Johnny Carson.  Oh.  A little bit?  Is there anything to that?  I don't know.  Everyone always says  something sounds like  something else.  I love when I do  an impression,  I go,  isn't that just dice?  But it's like,  yes,  you know why?  Because it's me doing it.  Yeah, exactly.  Shut up.  You were on Carson though.  Jack has his...  Yeah,  Carson did Carson  five times and...  Wow.  Jesus.  Well,  I say it was five times.  It was four times  with a repeat.  Hey,  come on. 
[02:13:30]  That's five times.  Well,  I didn't see it.  So,  yeah.  How do they treat you?  I think my manager's  learned something  she didn't know.  Yeah.  Say again?  He was good to you?  Oh,  yeah,  Johnny was great.  And I'll tell you  one of the weird ones  though is I'd been  on it like three times  and Jim McCauley,  the guy that used to  book the Tonight Show,  he called me and he says,  do you remember  when Johnny's son died?  Yes.  He went over a cliff  in a car  and Johnny took  a couple weeks off  and now he's going  to come back  for the first night.  And McCauley calls me  and he goes,  Jeff, 
[02:14:00]  I need you to do me  a favor.  He goes,  because his son  was a photographer  and he goes,  Johnny's put together  a montage  of his son's  best photographs  and he wants to do  a little thing  for his son  and show it on the air.  But if he bails on it  and doesn't want to do it,  we need you to stand by  and be ready to go on it.  Oh my God.  I'm like,  what?  Excuse me?  Yeah.  And I'm like,  he goes,  come on,  I know you can do this.  I'm like,  Jim,  he goes,  do it for Johnny.  I'm like,  oh man.  For Johnny.  Let's do it for Johnny.  So I'm literally backstage 
[02:14:30]  getting my makeup on.  They've gone through  the monologue.  You know,  I'm just sitting there.  What comic has prayed  that he would not  be on the Tonight Show?  Wow.  So I'm sitting back there  and McCauley comes in  and he got good news for you.  He goes,  Johnny's going to do  the photo thing  and I have to go on.  I'm like,  thank God I'm wiping makeup off.  I'm like,  I'm out of here.  But I did talk to Johnny afterwards.  That was the first,  only time I ever got  to talk to him off camera.  Wow.  Wow,  really?  Yeah.  So,  what'd you say to him? 
[02:15:00]  What do you,  number one,  what are you going to say  to Johnny Carson?  Number two,  what are you going to say  to Johnny Carson  about his son dying?  Right.  So I don't remember.  It was just,  something along the lines,  did you have to do  that fucking montage?  I took the trip out here  for nothing.  Thank you.  You're wasting my time,  sir.  Exactly.  I hope you're paying  for the car service  back to the hotel.  Not for nothing,  but this is not a hobby.  Wow,  check that out.  It's an old clip  from Carson,  man.  Oh yeah,  great holiday.  Boy,  those kidney stones  would have gotten out 
[02:15:30]  quicker than you.  That's amazing,  man.  See Carson at the desk  and you right there.  Where are you?  It's Tim Conway.  It's a pleasure  being on the show  with Tim Conway.  Oh yeah,  I can die happy now.  Walter hasn't lost  his wonderful ability  to communicate  with people,  yeah.  Yeah,  thanks a lot.  Yeah.  Can I finish?  Sure,  go right ahead.  Did I take applause  there,  Walter?  No,  okay.  Tim,  are we going 
[02:16:00]  too slow for you?  You know Ed McMahon?  What do you know  Ed McMahon?  Oh hell,  who doesn't know  Ed McMahon?  Don't you have  some envelopes  to lick?  That dude  kill him.  Good on us.  So Johnny,  what do you know  on fucking  Johnny Carson?  Does Walter  like watching himself  there?  I don't care.  No.  Tim Conway  and I had  our dressing rooms 
[02:16:30]  right next to each  other that night  and I opened  the door  thinking it was  the bathroom  and it was  Tim Conway  who was standing  there in his  underwear.  So it was like  oh I'm sorry  and he's like  oh no,  come on in,  let's have a party  here.  Take your pants  off.  Conway is a  funny guy.  Yes he is.  Holy crap.  Hey was that  the Carson  I meant to ask  too,  was that the Carson  where Fred  DeCordova,  his producer  told him to  wrap it up  while he was  eulogizing his  son?  I heard he never 
[02:17:00]  spoke to DeCordova  again.  Is that right?  Yeah,  that was what I  heard.  If it's true  that that  dumbbell  because I guess  they had to go  to commercial  told fucking  Carson  gave him that  rap sign  while he was  talking about  his son.  I never heard  that.  Yeah.  It could just  be something I  heard that's a  complete lie.  No,  making everyone  look bad.  Yeah,  I don't know.  But they're  saying it's time  to rap.  He has other  press to do.  I didn't mean  to end on a  depressing note.  Oh,  press.  Wow.  Well,  you did,  Jimmy.  You did.  You gotta go,  Jeff. 
[02:17:30]  I got 15  radio shows  to do.  Yeah,  I don't doubt  it,  man.  No,  I do.  It's like,  I gotta get on  the phone and do  that thing.  Yeah,  well,  this was more  fun,  though.  Let me tell you  something.  This is probably  the worst show  to start with  because you'd be  like,  yeah,  so we were  fucking hanging  out and  oh,  oh,  oh,  weight of  curse.  Oh,  shit.  Yeah,  well,  when they  went to,  when all that  stuff went  down,  when was it  that it  went down?  It was  after the,  uh,  everybody got  strict and  everything now.  Oh,  yeah,  was it  the 2003? 
[02:18:00]  A little of  that,  a little,  yeah,  there were a few  things that were  going on,  but yeah,  everybody got  strict on what  to say,  what not to  say.  Right.  Had nothing to do  with the FCC  anymore.  People were  worried that  certain interest  groups would  get fined.  just repugnant.  Right.  Well,  Jeff,  uh,  has got another  Comedy Central  special,  Sunday,  9 p.m.,  Controlled Chaos.  I'm really proud  of this one.  This one,  I said,  we worked on it  a long time.  There's a lot  of new stuff  in it.  Uh,  one of the  bits that I  brought back  is Peanut, 
[02:18:30]  uh,  and now,  um,  uh,  decided to  become a  ventriloquist,  and he pulls  out what he  called,  I pulled it  out for him,  this ugliest  dummy he's ever  thought of,  and,  uh,  and of course  it looks like  me.  Does that get  confusing in your  head?  Yeah,  but I've steered  away from that  stuff for years  because I go  straight for the  comedy and  straight for the  character,  but I thought  I'll bring back  one of the  technical bits  that people go,  holy crap,  how's he do that?  And he's  drinking water.  Yeah,  well,  that's next.  It's amazing, 
[02:19:00]  ladies and gentlemen.  That was actually  my bit the first  time I was in the  car.  That's the ugly  one there,  that's the ugly  one there,  he's ugly.  Oh,  get that one off.  Oh my gosh,  why don't you  like that one?  Oh my gosh,  what is that?  That is,  it only has a  million.  That's an improv  somewhere,  that's just frightening.  1.3 million views,  yeah,  get that awful  video off.  Unbelievable.  Oh well.  Well guys,  this has been fun.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  Jeff Dunham,  always a pleasure.  We'll all be  watching Sunday,  Controlled Chaos  on Comedy Central  at 9 o'clock. 
[02:19:30]  And the DVD  extras sound great,  man.  I fucking love  that computer thing.  Yeah,  I want to see that.  We'll pre-order  that on Amazon  right now.  Definitely want  to see that.  Alright,  very cool.  Thanks guys.  This has been the  highlight of my  day.  I don't doubt it.  I think we're  going to go to  break with  Patrice O'Neill  killing it on  the Charlie Sheen  Ross last night.  Totally off book,  Patrice.  Oh, we did,  huh?  Yeah.  He just threw  everything away  because everyone  else did the jokes  because he was  one of the last  guys to go?  Yeah,  he was the last  guy.  He was the last  guy,  so Patrice  pretty much had  to wing it  and he just  killed and  here it is. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you very  much.  It's strange  because I had  all this planned  shit but I  didn't know  William Shatner  was going to be  quasi like an  old racist man  like but  but everybody's  giggling like  oh, he's a  but  you're a  asshole,  Captain Kirk.  What are you  talking about?  Like I don't  respect him  but I don't  respect him  because he's  Captain Kirk. 
[02:20:30]  But I think he  might be racist  because his hair  plugs look like  black girls'  hair.  this is  amazing.  Like I wasn't  going to be  mean to Anthony  and I don't  know him.  I never met  him.  Like so I'm  sitting here  watching him  and I'm like  he has way  too much  confidence.  Like in my world  he's an open  micer.  Nobody knows  him and nobody  should.  Like nobody  should know  Anthony.  I refuse to 
[02:21:00]  learn his last  shitty name.  I learned  Galifernakis.  That's the last  shitty last name  this is going to  learn in this  funky town.  He reminds me  of a medieval  restaurant waiter.  Like his old  demeanor like  hello may I  welcome to  and you just  want to go  shut the  up and bring  me my giant 
[02:21:30]  turkey leg  you nothing.  How the  can I be  too mean  after all  this shit?  I can't  believe it.  I'm dying  of diabetes  and you  are like  oh that  evil fat  you know.  I consider  Seth an  icon.  I do.  Like I got  a critique  about Seth.  It's too  much Seth. 
[02:22:00]  It's  like it's  almost like  he's jealous  of his own  creation.  Where he  wants to  prove I'm  better than  the cartoons  but he's  not better  than the  cartoons.  See but I  think the  problem is  with Seth  is that he  don't have  a partner  you know  like the  South Park  guys or  Hannah  Barbera.  I know  I know we've  read that  old story  that Hannah  once said  I'm bigger  than Yogi  and Barbera  slapped the 
[02:22:30]  shit out  of him  for saying  that.  Seth needs  a Barbera  to slap  him and  slap him  twice.  Once to  say hey  man don't  forget why  people love  you and  two just  say you're  gay.  No  straight man  writes that  many show  tunes.  That's a  fact.  I love  Mike Tyson 
[02:23:00]  and I don't  have much  to say.  I'm just  disappointed  and hurt  at how  much comfort  white people  have around  you now.  I don't  like it.  this new  subdued  not drunk  you.  It stinks  man.  Why are you  still looking  at me like  that Mr.  Shatner sir?  You're like  boy I had  more for that  than I didn't 
[02:23:30]  say it.  I should have  said it  because he's  an asshole.  You're telling  it as it is.  You're telling  it as it is.  Jeff Ross  I love you  I guess.  Look.  Jeff Ross  is a legend.  His funniness  is a legend.  But when I  say legend  I mean a myth.  Like the  Loch Ness  Monster or  Bigfoot.  Like we  all believe  they exist  but who  really ever  saw it? 
[02:24:00]  Oh shit.  I've turned  down many  roasts.  I have.  About three  or four of  them.  And I said  yes to this  and I'm dead  ass serious.  I said yes  to this  because I  respect  Charlie Sheen.  I do.  I say yes  because I  respect.  Not his  body of work.  Like not.  It's all been  very Christian  Slayer-ish. 
[02:24:30]  He sucks  but he's  good but  he sucks  at the same  time.  I think  that his  stand that  he made  against the  business.  I think  this is a  business but  he stood  up.  He still  survived.  and he  proved that  nobody can  keep  like a  Sheen  down.  You know.  They can  keep  SFS down  because his  brother  and he's 
[02:25:00]  the good  one.  That  mother do  everything  right.  And that  career is  over.  Holy shit.  Tiger blood.  He's selling  his own  blood to  make money.  But I  want to  say to  your eyes  man I  love that  you stood  up to  what you  thought was  wrong and  I'm  impressed by  you and  I wanted  to say  that.  So thank  you man.  Thanks for  having me.  Y'all take  care.  Thank you. 
[02:25:30]  Hey this is  Bob Saget.  Yo this is  Charlie Murphy.  This is  Doug Stanhope.  What's up  America?  This is  Jeffrey Ross.  You're  listening to  ONA.  That's  nothing to  be proud  of.  So Mayor  Menino talked  again.  Well attempted. 
[02:26:00]  Attempted to  talk.  Jeff Dunham  was very  entertaining.  Yes he was.  Fucking he's  an open guy.  I like when he  comes in.  I do too.  He talks about  his life and  he doesn't try  to do  material.  He's just  great.  Interesting.  Yeah he's  like a regular  guy too you  know.  Kind of  respects what  we do too  which I  like.  Yeah.  I was  telling Jimmy  going down  the hall.  Makes that  well.  He knows  he's doing  a different  radio show.  You know.  Yeah.  And he gives  us some  respect.  I like that.  Well he  doesn't.  I like that.  Because radio  in general just  sucks.  It sucks that  we're part of  this industry. 
[02:26:30]  It really  does.  His instincts  as a comedian  he knows you  can't just come  in and do  material and  he's a  veteran man.  On this show  especially.  Yeah it  doesn't feel  right to come  in here and  just do joke  jokes and  so he's  just he's  just I  love to hear  about that  fucking 3D  printer.  Fuck man.  I swear to  God I never  heard of the  3D printer  until today.  We talked  about it once  before we  touched on  it.  I must have  been angry  about something  I wasn't  paying attention.  I didn't  realize it  was I think  yeah you said  something about  why don't they  fucking 3D  print some  cameras on 
[02:27:00]  this.  Why don't  they just  3D print me  and get me  the fuck  out of here.  I don't  know.  I don't  remember us  talking about it.  I'm sure  I'm sure  you talked  about it.  Yeah there  was some  I remember  it came up  once we  were talking  about it.  I think  it was  one of  rambling  things I  was doing  on something  I watched  the night  before.  We forgot  to mention  that during  the break  he showed  a little  video of  one of  his puppet  heads  being made  and it's  just  fucking  fascinating.  When you  think it  used to  just be  clay and  fucking  putting shit 
[02:27:30]  together like  that now  you press a  button and  drink a  beer.  I don't  even know  if you  could call  it a  printer.  The printer  thing is  just going  back and  forth just  slowly  molding this  thing.  And here's  why you  gotta love  that guy.  He's worth  fucking  millions.  And he  could literally  coast and  do 3,000  4,000 seats  for the rest  of his career  on YouTube  hits alone.  And he's  coming out  with all  this  he puts  the printer  thing in  the DVD 
[02:28:00]  to make  it better.  He's not  just whoring  out.  He still  works hard.  Yeah man  that's a guy  who works.  It's like  it's good  to see.  I respect  that work.  Work.  Work.  Work ethic.  I'm gonna  look up  the word  work.  It'll show  my picture.  It will.  I got a  Wikipedia  work.  What is  it?  Does  work have  its own  Wikipedia  page?  I'm sure.  All right.  Mayor Menino  stops by  WBZ News  Radio 1030  in Boston  to proclaim  that Monday  was WBZ 
[02:28:30]  Radio Day  to celebrate  their 90th  anniversary.  Okay.  Am I right?  And?  It's a long  time.  90 years.  And he  mumbled his  way through.  I guess  Travis described  this perfectly.  What did you  say?  Picture giving  a two minute  speech in a  minute and  40 seconds.  That's what  he did.  Oh.  He's a guy  that can't  speak quickly.  No.  That would  not work  for him  ever.  I wonder  if he still  hates us.  Our voices  are still  heard in 
[02:29:00]  Boston  motherfucker.  They certainly  are.  You tried  but you  can't get  rid of  these stupid  voices.  No.  You think  our voices  are in  Fennell Hall  right now  somewhere in  some little  shop they  got us on  the back  or something?  I'm sure  someone's  got it on.  You think?  Yeah.  Maybe a  Newberry  Comics they  got us on  the back a  little bit?  Are there  even any  of those  left?  I don't  know.  I would  assume  Newberry  Comics is  still surviving.  Yeah.  And they've  got a big  presence online  too.  You can buy  a lot of  stuff.  That's a  cool store  man.  That type  of store.  They're like  vintage vinyl 
[02:29:30]  in Jersey.  They're one  of those  niche stores  that's probably  never going  to go away.  They do a  lot of  stuff online  like exclusive  autographed  CDs from  different artists  that are  affordable.  But they  have a deal  with Newberry  Comics.  Oh okay.  Like who?  Newberrycomics.com  if you want  to check it  out.  Newberry.  Newberry.  So here's  the dumb  mayor mumbling  his way through  some stupid  berries.  Here's the

Whereas  WBZ  is celebrating  its 90th  anniversary  as the  first and  oldest radio  station in  Boston  and began  broadcast on  September 19th  1921.  And whereas  over the  90 years  WBZ  has provided  important  emergency and  public safety  reports for the  residents of our  city.  Whereas  WBZ  has dedicated  enormous  resources  efforts 
[02:31:30]  and the  time to  raise money  for worthy  causes like  the Children's  Hospital in  Boston.  Whereas  WBZ  revolutionized  traffic to  point with  traffic on  the threes  to help  Boston  commuters  every morning.  And whereas  Oh my god  this is the  mayor.  Get the  fuck out  of here.  Traffic  to point  with traffic  on the  threes.  Holy  mother of 
[02:32:00]  god.  How does  this happen?  They love  them too.  Oh yeah.

Whereas WBZ  has been  designated the  Marconi Award  winner legendary  station of the  year by the  National Association  Broadcasters due  to its  work over 
[02:32:30]  90 years.  It's what  work?  During it's  what work?  During it.  He turned the  word fair into  fear by the way.  Did you hear  that?  Yeah.  Fear.  Fear.  It's going to be  a blood  rotation on  this.  What does he  say?  What was that  that he tried  to say?  I couldn't  even figure  that one out.  Sam wrote  WBZ has  shaft. 
[02:33:00]  Shaft.  Shaft.  The Boston area  has to  brazen.  Shaft.  Very, very  heavy  brazen.  Brazen.  Brazen.  Yoohoo Rocket  from Jersey  writes, he's  Archie Bunker  with Bill's  Palsy.  Who shares  that?  Dresses.  By the  National  Association of  Broadcasters  due to its  work over 
[02:33:30]  90 years.  And whereas  I, Thomas  Mignor,  Mayor of the  City of  Boston,  graduate WBZ  Radio on  its outstanding  commitment to  the citizens of  Boston,  Radio Well  and listeners  and to my  head.  I don't even  know what he  said there.  Radio Well  listeners.  Can you type it  out for us,  Sam?  One more time,  I'll type it out.  First of all,  he can barely  say his name.  He can barely  say, yeah,  go back a little  ways because he  can't say his  name.  He can't say,  the radio  station.  He can't say  Boston.  He can't say  what they do.  No.  This is a  mishmash. 
[02:34:00]  Someone wants  to know if  the mayor has  mafia connections.  He's been there  so long.  We don't discuss  that on this  radio show.  We don't know.  Oh, no, we  don't ever talk  about stuff.  Oh, Dubba  BZ has  served the  resins.  Oh, Dubba  BZ has  served the  resins.  I think.  Let's see.  The broadcasters  due to its  necessary work  over the 90  years.  I, Thomas  Meneor,  mayor of the  city of  Boston,  congratulate  WBZ radio  on its  outstanding  commitment to  the citizens 
[02:34:30]  of Boston,  radio,  listeners,  and Dubai  have  proclaimed.  Yeah, that's  the part we  need.  Due to its  missionary work.  Missionary work.  Oh,  missionary.  Missionary work.  But listen  closely.  Ready, Sam?  Yeah.  Sam's typing.  Here we go.  The citizens  of Boston.  Radio  well and  listeners in  Dubai.  The radio  well listeners.  Radio well  listeners.  Was that  it?  Yeah, the  radio well  listeners.  I think it's  Otwell.  Otwell? 
[02:35:00]  Rotten listeners.  That's what he meant.  He meant rotten listeners.  Radio-aught listeners.  Radioactive listeners.  Oh, my God.  Someone got emergency services.  The radio listeners are radioactive listeners. 
[02:35:30]  This guy is such a tool.  I love him.  The citizens of Boston, radio listeners, and do by here proclaim Monday, September 19, 2011,  to be WBZ Radio Day in the city of Boston.  That's my favorite part.  In the city of Boston.  We now have to play that at least five more times.  What was he thinking?  What happened to Boffiston?  In the city of Boston.  We probably got to him. 
[02:36:00]  Holy shit.  That's probably because of us.  He goes, I got to fucking practice saying Boffiston.  In the city of Boston.  And he was thinking Dubai or something in there, too, I think.  He said, and Dubai here proclaim.  Oh, Dubai.  Dubai here.  Dubai.  Dubai.  Dubai.  Proclaim.  Dubai.  Dubai.  Yes.  Steve, 2011, to be WBZ Radio Day in the city of Boston. 
[02:36:30]  That's one of the greatest one single words he's ever said.  I mean, we've strung together a few that he really sounded retarded, but I've never heard  one word come out of him that is that fucking good.  Let's not forget Mappins.  Boston.  Let's not forget Mappins, Ann.  City of Boston.  E-Rock, what other words has he said terrifically over the years?  Mappins is one of my faves.  I don't know the towns around there, but he always mispronounced all the towns that make  up Boston.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  It's Boff.  And he gets, when they were honoring their celebrity athletes or whatever, he'd get the  name wrong for the sport that they were supposed to be inducted for.  Right.  Okay.  2011, to be WBZ Radio Day in the city of Morstan.  I just want to congratulate all of you for being on the whole team here.  I can't believe how bad that is.  Morstan.  He sucks at talking.  Morstan.  I just want to congratulate all of you for being on the whole team here. 
[02:37:30]  You've got a great team here who really understands what broadcasting is all about.  So, Joe and the team here, thank you for keeping us informed of what's happening in  our world.  We understand what broadcasting is all about.  Mayor Tom Manino, WBZ Radio Day in Boston.  It's an honor.  He puts the essence in what broadcasting is all about.  We understand what broadcasting is all about.  Dumb motherfucker.  Stupid.  City of Morstan.  City of Morstan.  He dragged it out like he was taking two weeks or something, you know? 
[02:38:00]  Exactly, Chip.  Holy shit.  Good one.  Thanks.  You want to hear Morstan again?  A thousand times.  One more time.  Citizens of Boston, radio listeners and Dubai here proclaim Monday, September 19th, 2011  to be WBZ Radio Day in the city of Morstan.  City of Morstan.  That's what happens when the left side of your brain just bursts and bleeds and you shut  down on the podium.  Stroke face.  That is fantastic. 
[02:38:30]  Let me go to Cassius.  Cassius, what do you have, sir?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, not only is, you know, pronunciation is so weird, but the rhythm of it is so awkward  that I'm getting seasick here.  I'm feeling cautious.  It's like being in a car where a guy is, like, hitting the brake a lot.  Right, right, right.  And then going and breaking, going and breaking, just fucking everything up.  The rhythm of the ride.  Yeah.  And then it sounds like he makes up, I mean, you can believe that he, like, he says tertiary 
[02:39:00]  at some point, like, he's speaking, like, complicated legalese.  He tries to sound like he knows what the fuck he's talking about and how to talk about.  He's obviously dyslexic, right?  Dyslexic.  There's something wrong with that.  I don't think he can read.  But he reads.  Because then when he stopped reading, it wasn't as bad.  Yeah.  He just, he talks ahead of his mouth, like, he's thinking the next thing through, and  he's just clumsily tripping.  It's like his head is fucking three feet in front of his feet as he's walking. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, he's constantly trying to not fall on his face, but every so often, Boston.  That's catching up when he does Boston.  Did he say Boston?  I think I did.  The citizens of Boston, radio listeners, and Dubai here, proclaim Monday, September 19th,  2011, to be WBZ Radio Day in the city of Boston.  That's, it's great.  Boston.  It's great. 
[02:40:00]  It's hard.  He may just be a moron.  How did that fucking guy get us fired?  I know.  That is really great the way he says that.  Yeah, yeah, thanks, guys.  And you knew it was there, didn't you?  Yeah, you were waiting for it.  Oh.  Did I just hang up on Cassius?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  He's going to come back as Muhammad Ali and beat you up or something.  Ah, Chip.  He's the guy we put on hold so he could get the service for free.  Whoops.  Oh, boy.  You're going to get people upset.  Yeah, screw him. 
[02:40:30]  Yes, Chip.  Chip, I hear you.  Chip has this tell.  He wants it, so he just starts with us.  Chip doesn't like to interrupt.  I try to ignore it.  Those are Chip's commas.  He just tries to.  Does Chip have something today?  No, it's just, you know.  Yeah.  He's just saying he looks like the way he talks is so slow, like he's on the last.  This is something.  Ah, that's a good one. 
[02:41:00]  There's a new episode of Chip's TV show.  Oh, is there?  On YouTube.  From the convention floor.  Chip of TV.  Chip of TV.  Hold on, we do that.  This is Chip Chippison.  I'm performing live.  God damn it, fucking cunt.  Don't leave that in there.  That's the type of talk that nobody wants.  This is Chip Chipp.  Why that lady's got big tits?  Don't show her.  Don't put this on there, though.  I like to suck those tits and then kick her in the stomach, push her down the steps, like 
[02:41:30]  my mother.  Chip, your intro.  Your intro.  My mother would just lay there while all those blacks was on top of her.  Oh, shit.  Pumping away.  Hi, can we interview you?  Wow, that's really cool.  What's your name?  My name's Savannah.  Looks like you ate a bunch of blueberries or something.  Yeah, pretty much.  She's all blue, yes.  What's that supposed to be?  I'm Mystique from X-Men.  Yes.  Mrs. Teague?  Mystique.  Oh, it looks like, well, that's really cool. 
[02:42:00]  Is that paint?  Yes, it's body paint, yeah.  How do you get that off?  A really, really hot shower.  Oh, yeah, I take a lot of cold showers, though, because you know what I'm saying.  It's really cool, though.  I was like, wow, your hair's all red and stuff.  Yeah.  From the movie.  Yeah, exactly.  I tried my best.  I was that blue.  People probably think I'm cold or something.  What's your name?  I'm Leah.  Hi, are you having fun?  Yeah, I am. 
[02:42:30]  It's really fun here.  There's a lot of big, fat people here.  I hate them.  You said it, not me.  I know, but it bugs me, though, when they're all fat and stuff.  Don't you hate that?  No, not really, no.  That's what you should say, that you're blue, because they stepped on your feet or something.  Oh, there you go, yeah.  Exactly.  It doesn't take you to do that.  Probably like two hours, right?  Yeah, like two hours.  And you didn't put it all over yourself, right?  Not everywhere, no.  Yeah, not, you know. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah, not everywhere.  But, yeah.  How come you didn't dress up?  You just got your shirt on.  She has spot ears.  Yeah.  Let me see that.  Oh, could you get that with the camera?  It looks like you're trying to listen to something in Timbuktu or something.  That's real pointy and stuffy ears.  You should probably jab somebody right in the eye like that.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, just take the fucking eyes out.  All these fat people. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  You should always point at yourself and go, I'm blue, because you're sucking up all the air or something.  With your big, fat stomach.  Okay, I'll say that for you.  I'll say it just for you.  I'll say it just for you, I promise.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, it's nice to meet you.  Thank you very much.  Have a good comical con.  It's on Chipper TV on YouTube.  Chipper TV.  It's T-H-I-P-P-A-H.  Chipper.  Let's walk over there.  Oh, look, Cafe Express. 
[02:44:00]  That means the cafe is going to express itself.  Get that on the camera.  What is it?  Wow.  This is Chipper's set.  Hi, what is that?  This is my guard arc.  Yo, what?  My guard arc.  What's a guard arc?  Is that when you're throwing, like, darts or something?  No, it's a guard arc.  It's the name of the sword.  I'm glad that guy left.  He was a cocksucker.  Yeah, but what is the character with that?  Is that heavy?  Is that, like, 200 pounds or something?  No, it's only eight pounds. 
[02:44:30]  What do you, is that, what's this part of it?  Is that, like, to put it, like, in a bike rack or something?  It's, like, some kind of motor or something.  I have no idea, but still.  Is your hair, that's cool, your hair.  Is that your hair or is that a wig?  Just a wig.  What's the, oh, your eyes are red, too.  Looks like you was up studying or doing something with your eyes to be red.  Like, I don't know, watching porn or something.  Porn is good.  I like porn, too.  Sometimes I jerk off too long, I pull off, like, a layer of skin.  Ah, that never happened to me once.  That happens to me a lot. 
[02:45:00]  I get real angry.  I just keep doing it even when I'm finished.  It's all awkward.  There's a lot of fat, ugly girls here.  I hate these fat, ugly girls.  I said to one girl, I'm like, you're a...  I said to some girl, I'm like, you're big and fat.  Why don't you stop eating pizza?  I'm like, you're a fucking fat bitch.  He's walking away from it.  Thank you for this, um... 
[02:45:30]  Thank you for this, um...  These are easy.  Hi, how are you?  Good, how are you?  I'm okay, I'm Chip.  What's the kind of gun is that?  It's a blaster.  And a blaster?  And what do you use that for?  To kill people.  Where are you from?  Star Wars.  You're from Star Wars?  Is that like a place or something?  I was...  I'm from a park of...  So I was...  Why haven't you had a movie yet? 
[02:46:00]  How old are you?  21.  21.  Oh, so you just started drinking?  Wink, wink.  What's your name?  Mariah.  Hi, I'm Chipper.  I like your chain or something.  Is that like a real bike chain?  I had one like that and my friends used to whip me with it.  What's my back?  It's plastic.  Oh.  I had a bike chain one time and my friend Bruce took it off and was whipping my back and told  the police to stop. 
[02:46:30]  That sounds like it would hurt.  Yeah.  Do you come with a bunch...  Is there a bunch of guys that you like here?  Because they're all dressed up as different people.  I came with a group of people.  Oh, do you guys drive or take a bus?  Yeah.  Oh, we took a plane.  Yeah.  I think my group's leaving though, so...  I'm sorry.  Have a fun time at Comical Con.  Bye-bye.  It's nice talking to you.  Chip's an idiot.  Yeah.  That chick wanted to fuck me so bad. 
[02:47:00]  She was getting all wet and sloppy.  Oh, look at this.  He's a clown or something.  I wonder if he rapes children.  Hi.  Looks like he got fries or something in there.  No, he's the golden fries.  Oh, are those more than the regular ones?  Oh, yeah.  You got the gun.  It's like, what's it say?  Oh, McBang.  One time I gave a girl a McBang and she screamed McRape.  Ain't a bang without a McBang.  Yeah.  So how come you dressed up like Ronald McDonaldland or something? 
[02:47:30]  Because I'm his brother, Ray Ray.  What's that?  I'm his brother, Ray Ray.  Oh, Ray Ray McDonald's?  Oh, yeah.  Where do you live?  I live in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Oh, I was in Philadelphia one time.  I was with my friend, Keith.  Keith?  Keith?  Okay.  Yeah.  I heard of Keith.  Keith, what's that?  Um, uh...  Looks like he's going to go play baseball or something in a Little League.  It's only ketchup.  Oh, because it looks like a girl's period or something.  That's why I wrote it right there. 
[02:48:00]  It's only ketchup.  Oh, so nobody thinks it's anything bad?  Yeah.  Do you like McDonaldland foods?  I hate McDonald's.  You don't like it?  Nah, I don't eat McDonald's.  I'm just an enforcer.  He's in white face.  When they leave me, they call me up, go take care of Burger King, go take care of Jack.  This is what happens.  Oh, I saw a guy dressed like the...  Oh, good.  I hate the Burger King.  You saw him, and then I saw him.  One time when I saw him on TV, I said, I hope he gets cancer.  My mother said, chipper.  Oh, dang.  I ain't got cancer no more, because he ain't catching... 
[02:48:30]  Cut his head off.  Look at that.  That's the way he treats the Burger King.  He cuts his head off and stuff.  Look at that.  Yeah.  Savage.  Of course.  Boy, he's got no ears.  Hey, maybe McDonald's does it his way.  Oh, wow.  That's great.  The Burger King got his head cut off.  It looks like his...  Wow.  It looks like his...  Wow.  Thank you for talking, Mr. McDonald's.  This is an idiot.  Oh, did you get a picture of the head?  What happened?  His head got all cut off. 
[02:49:00]  He lost his head or something while he was in an argument.  I'm just killing here.  Look at that hat or something.  Hey, what's that hat?  What do you got?  Big hair?  You can't get anyone's attention.  No one wants to talk to you.  Oh, my God.  I don't know how to leave you.  Oh, God.  That was embarrassing.  Where do they see that?  The YouTube channel is Chip TV Show.  Chip TV Show?  How long is it?  That's eight minutes.  Oh, my God.  We could have made two out of that one. 
[02:49:30]  That's fucking fantastic.  I think it should be three-something, though.  I love that.  Oh, and it was just posted on the Facebook.  Opie and Anthony.  Is that the last of the Chip stuff?  That's the last.  Oh, you're going to have to go to the AVNs.  Someone's saying you go to the AVNs with that.  Chip would love the AVNs.  Chip would absolutely love them.  A lot more of them there might know me because I've hosted it.  But I've got to get an outfit, like a look for Chip.  Yeah.  The face is right.  But you need, like, some kind of clothes.  Like a mullet?  Chip should have a mullet, I think.  A mullet?  A mullet? 
[02:50:00]  No, you think the hair is okay?  I don't know.  Maybe a hat of some sort?  Well, you're too recognizable, so you've got to get some kind of hair on.  Some kind of...  Or a hat.  I think, like, a bow tie, though.  I agree.  He thinks he's being fancy.  A UFC event, too, I think Chip would be great at.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, because he loves manly stuff.  The Expo, you know, about the guy fighting and stuff.  I pinned a guy one time, but he goes, get them pins out of me.  So he got jokes?  Yeah, I was ready.  I was writing them for two weeks.  Why wouldn't they?  Two weeks. 
[02:50:30]  What an idiot Chip is.  I love Chip.  Horned rimmed glasses, you're saying?  Oh, yeah.  That'll be a gun.  There might be another Menino clip on Barstool.  Really?  Barstool Sports.  Another The Proclamation, too.  Him and his proclamations.  What year is this?  Let's just stop with the proclamation.  Especially when he can't even say the word.  Yeah.  Boston.  Best. 
[02:51:00]  What a toll.  What is it called?  Rate?  Rate Mayor Menino's Boston something...  Canon's Day speech.  Oh, my God.  It's got to be bad.  You want to try it?  Canon's Day proclamation.  Yeah, we'll try it.  Fuck it.  The last.  Whereas the Boston Cannons, a founding franchise, are majorly across...  Founding fair case.  Now he's in public with this nonsense.  Yeah, yeah.  What's the backstory of this?  What is this? 
[02:51:30]  Someone recorded it on their iPhone, and of course they fucking held the iPhone the wrong way.  I don't know why you can't turn the fucking image once it's on the computer.  I don't know how to do that.  I get so confused.  I hate that look.  It's for Boston Canon's Day.  What is that?  I don't know.  I guess it's a day in Boston.  Yeah, specifically for one camera.  Oh, Chip Jim.  Is it short?  1.42.  God, he loves it. 
[02:52:00]  His proclamation is to be about a minute 40.  He loves it.  Yeah, he loves it.  I hit it.  The franchise of Major League Lacrosse in this 11th season won their first Major League Lacrosse  Championship and Stenfield Trophy by defeating the Hamilton Nationals 10-9 in the MML Championship  game on August 28, 2011, whereas the Canons have resilience and tenacity by playing... 
[02:52:30]  Tenacity.  Resilience and tenacity.  He might have said cancer at one point.  And then nasty.  I know it did sound like something said cancer.  It has nothing to do with cancer, though.  That's what's scary about this.  He drops words.  Yeah.  And then half of words he drops.  Right.  On August 28, 2011, the Murevs, the Canons have...  The Canons have...  Tenacity.  Tenacity by playing through Hurricane Irene. 
[02:53:00]  You know the governor?  I stand in emergency, guys.  The emergency was one of the championships.  On August 27, the semifinals...  Holy shit.  Why do his flunkies laugh?  He's riffing.  They're laughing at him.  They're laughing like, oh, that was a good joke.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't know.  Game.  Come from behind.  Scoring.  A last second goal.  Defeat the defending champion, Chesapeake Bayhawks. 
[02:53:30]  14-13.  Yesterday, okay.  Yeah.  Whereas.  Whereas.  I don't know what he just said.  It's a lot of whereas and...  I, I, I, I, as.  Yeah.  Here to wit.  You don't have to go back that far.  Yeah.  13-3 yesterday, okay.  Whereas the Canons add to the winning tradition of the city of Boston.  bringing another professional sports championship, the trophy, to share with fans throughout New England.  As a token of thanks for the... 
[02:54:00]  A token.  A token.  That's what he said, troken.  A token.  He's not, I, I swear, I'm trying to understand what he's saying.  It's too much work.  It, it really is.  Troken of thanks.  Troken.  Oh, a troken of thanks.  That's nice.  Yeah.  That's very nice.  Troken.  The last 11 years, they continue to support as they defend their title next year.  Now, therefore, I, Thomas San Menino, mayor of the city of Boston, to hereby proclaim Monday, September 12th, 2011, to Boston Canons Day in the city of Boston. 
[02:54:30]  I'd like to give this to the, uh, the owner of the team, who works hard, every day, Matt Dwyer.  Boston Canons Day.  Yeah.  Boston Canons Day.  He's supposed to say Boston Canons Day.  Boston Canaday.  And it's like, hey, proclaim his day, September 9th, 2011.  It's going to be Boston Canons Day.  Boston Canaday.  Boston Canons Day.  He doesn't even say his name right.  No.  No. 
[02:55:00]  Matt Jonathan Canons Day.  Matt Jonathan Canons Day.  What is that?  There's a, it's something.  Retardation.  We, we said many years ago, his, his tongue must be too thick.  But he's also rushing his thoughts because he's not just tripping on words.  You could tell it's his thought process, too, that's clumsily, clumsily.  I wonder if he is dyslexic.  You might be right.  I think he is.  And I, how does he come up in politics and make it this far?  When you can't speak properly.  You've got to speak in public a lot.  Who is he running against? 
[02:55:30]  Somebody with Tourette's?  A turnip.  With his tongue cut out.  Yeah.  He stinks.  We couldn't think of anybody with a tongue cut out.  No, I was trying to think of some ancient fucking.  Guy from Game of Thrones who wrote the King song.  Yeah.  Do you want your tongue or your hands?  Oh, how about Rifki from Midnight Express?  Oh, right.  There you go.  Him and his dumb watered down tea.  A little rat.  We had Michael K. Williams next week.  Kitty died.  We do?  Yes.  Yes, we do. 
[02:56:00]  Very excited.  He's in Community now.  And Chalky White on Boardwalk Empire.  I think he's promoting Boardwalk.  But yeah, he's on Community, too.  He's on Community now.  He's doing great.  Community.  Community premieres, I think, on Thursday.  And Boardwalk premieres.  I think on Sunday.  What happened?  When Boardwalk Empire premieres.  People just love Omar so much that he had to work.  He had to work after that. 
[02:56:30]  Fuck yeah.  Scorsese thanked him at the Emmys.  What?  Scorsese won a directing award for Boardwalk.  Yeah, and he thanked Michael K. Williams.  Why?  He was thanking the people on Boardwalk, and one of them he mentioned by name was Michael K. Williams.  You think Scorsese dyes those eyebrows at this point because it's what he's known for?  His trademark?  That's all I was thinking about when he was giving his speech.  He hasn't clipped them once in his whole life, I don't think.  It's important to have a strong eyebrow. 
[02:57:00]  I'm sure there was a point that was the only thing that didn't go gray, but at this point  it had to go gray, but he decided to dye it to keep the look going.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, yeah, that seems to be an important thing for him.  Just a dumb thought, I understand, but...  It's very important.  It's my discussion.  It's what I brought up.  I brought up a poor recommendation today here in Boston.  For men that said long eyebrows is on the ground.  Here in Boston.  How do you say Boston again?  I wrote it down.  Boston.  Boston. 
[02:57:30]  Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  Boston.  Well, Sam's good at spelling Mayor Menino's words.  Very good.  Sam actually thinks that's how you spell Boston properly.  That's true.  Yeah.  I didn't realize.  Yeah, Sam, not the sharpest.  No.  Not the sharpest.  Oh.  The Google game is big.  Yeah.  We have noticed on this show that Jim Norton has a lot of celebrity friends.  Yeah.  By the way, I almost forgot when I asked a girl out in high school who I had a crush on, Michelle.  Yeah.  I think I told her story.  I called her. 
[02:58:00]  I knew she'd say no, but I had to ask her.  And she said, I'm like, you don't want to go out with me, do you?  And she's like, no.  And then I said, I try to be funny.  And I'm like, wow, that's the way the ball crumbles.  Or I say that or cookie bounces.  Yeah, because you didn't want to.  The reference.  Because you wanted to catch her with a little bit of humor.  Thinking she might go, ha, ha, you know, that's funny.  Yeah, I will go out with you.  You gave her an out, though.  It never works.  If I say it that way, I should have shot myself. 
[02:58:30]  So I have celebrity friends, I do.  Yes, you do.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  On today's show, Tyra Banks.  I like trannies.  Oh, my God.  I like trannies, too.  Celebrity friends of Jim Norton.  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy. 
[02:59:00]  Okay.  Aw, you have friends with Tyra Banks?  That's great.  It's important to have things in common with your friends.  Similar interests.  Yes.  Yes.  That's funny.  Who sang that?  Troy Kwan.  Troy Kwan.  That's great.  Point the musician.  Why wasn't he like,  Celebrity friends of Little Jimmy.  Celebrity friends of Jimmy.  Because, you know, he does that kind of music.  He screams so loud.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's frightening. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Frightening.  Hey, we got a Saints fan that goes nuts after a bad call.  I haven't seen this yet.  Am I right in my thinking?  What's that?  What are you thinking?  Saints fan.  Gotcha.  Don't know.  Those people.  Okay, you could have been a little bit so.  I'm just thinking.  And it's talking about those people.  Maybe.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:00:00]  Look at this shit.  What is that?  It's not a bad one.  That's just fucking bullshit.  Oh, shit.  The fucking hell.  You have 10 refries in the field on this shit.  It looked to me from here like it was a little more physical than it needed to be.  Even the fucking announcers are saying to me.  God damn.  This is ridiculous, man.  That's white, by the way.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What is that?  Whatever happened to Tom from New Orleans? 
[03:00:30]  Ted.  Oh, yeah.  He was probably fucking murdered in Houston when he relocated to the Astrodome.  You know, we used to like to drink.  I miss those days when we got to meet some of these guys from other cities.  Oh, my God.  Just clusterfucks, Tom.  How you doing?  Let you drink right here in the airport.  The airport.  The airport.  Hey.  You want a hurricane?  E-Rod, could you find the phone booth bit? 
[03:01:00]  Do you know the phone booth bit with Tom?  Have we ever replayed that where we almost got him killed?  Oh, that wasn't fucking.  Let me look.  I forgot which bit you were talking about.  Remember he was at the convenience store and we were feeding him lies or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you can find that, man.  But anyway, more of this.  God damn.  This is ridiculous, man.  One shot of goddamn fucking game again. 
[03:01:30]  Bullshit!  You goddamn right here, I'll be fucking out.  He's talking to the TV.  I'll fucking one goddamn side of ball game.  You fucking lose this bastard now.  You fucking piece of shit.  Fuck.  Sounds like you talking to management.  Bullshit!  20 years of this shit!  People really get into their team, man. 
[03:02:00]  Who taped this?  Oh, his kid, I think.  His kid finally had it.  They're maliciously doing shit.  They need to throw flags.  And we ain't going to do this like, look at this shit!  He's 10 yards out of bounds!  He's 10 yards out of bounds.  It's Meechum.  We're at five catches.  It's unbelievable!  But they get through a personal play and give us 15-yard penalty and give a first down.  On a tackle!  That's hard.  This is hard to live with, man. 
[03:02:30]  I'll tell you, bud.  Hard to live with?  He goes, this is hard to live with.  Kill yourself.  Is he unbelievable or hard to live with?  What?  I think he said unbelievable.  Oh, oh, it sounded like he said he's hard to live with.  I don't know.  Either way, the guy's, uh...  I've been pissed off at dumber shit.  What am I talking about?  Oh, this man is for the birds.  Yeah, I think this is most of Norm's set.  Oh, fucker.  That was funny.  Fucking asshole.  What, did we turn into a clip show all of a sudden?  Yeah, I know.  What the fuck? 
[03:03:00]  That clock just won't get to 10, will it?  Here's what the issue is.  If I put this clip on...  We fell in that weird zone where it's like,  you can't start something new  because there's really not enough time,  but, yeah, there's nothing really long enough,  so it's like a bunch of little clip things.  We want to do Bobo's Date,  but that, you know, we don't want to rush to that.  Yeah, we can do Bobo's Date,  but that's too much time.  Well, what do you guys got planned for the rest of the day?  Well, I got a good plan.  Uh-huh.  What do you got? 
[03:03:30]  I think Sam's been doing, um...  Well, let's just say, um...  Adequate.  Adequate job.  You have to watch what you say.  Yeah, I got to watch what I say.  I just helped Anthony out there.  Thank you.  Adequate.  An adequate job.  Uh, of late.  And I'll tell you this,  Google, I was on my game today.  Boy, all them videos.  No, you know what?  No complaints today about that.  That's what's up.  Yeah.  We'll make sure Mother knows  that you did well with Google today.  My mom doesn't care about silly Google.  When are we getting our fucking key lime pie?  I'll waste a few minutes 
[03:04:00]  talking about your mom's treats.  Well, my mom didn't like  the way I was browbeaten  for my Googling skills  as if it actually is a skill.  So she's punishing us now.  Well, she's not going to have to wait anymore.  Why wouldn't she?  Key lime pies.  Although she made brownies,  and, uh,  I forgot to bring them in.  Yeah, you told us,  and she's not going to let you serve us  one day old brownies.  One day old brownies.  That's ridiculous.  So when the fuck  is all this going down?  What, the key lime pies?  And the brownies.  The brownies can happen at any moment.  How about tomorrow?  Well, if she's listening,  she'll probably start making brownies now, 
[03:04:30]  which I hope you feel guilty about.  Does she listen every morning  waiting for you to talk?  Ugh.  She listens to the show  after she wakes up.  She doesn't listen to the whole show.  But then she catches the replay  to make sure you didn't say anything.  Well, my dad wakes up a little earlier,  so he'll listen,  and then he'll tell her  if I said something  of interest.  Oh, my God.  That was true.  He'd never tell her anything.  Yeah, he'd never speak.  I think your parents need hobbies.  Yeah, I know.  I think that's true.  My mom's in...  They're bored shitless over there.  My mom's in the women's club,  so she's got a hobby.  What's the women's club? 
[03:05:00]  Not the Red Hat Society.  I don't know.  It's some club where my...  Does she wear a fucking red hat?  She never wears a hat.  I saw another old lady  with a red hat  getting her nails done.  She's the youngest woman  in the club,  and my mom is, you know...  What is the Red Hat Society called?  Is it the Red Hat Society?  Yes, it is.  They all just wear red hats  and they go to dinner.  She's in a women's club?  You know what that means, right?  They les out.  They don't les out.  They do les out.  They really do.  They're all old women.  Toy parties and stuff.  Scissoring.  They don't...  They're scissoring.  Because that's like not cheating, 
[03:05:30]  so they scissor each other.  Scissoring is cheap.  They do keep their clothes on.  They might get down  to their pantyhose  before they scissor.  Pantyhose?  Yeah, their pantyhoses.  It's not a sex club.  It has to be.  Sounds like it.  It's a social club.  No.  And she's not a red hat society.  You're trying to tell me  that some old lesbos  aren't joining a women's club hoping?  My mom's not an old lesbo.  I'm not saying all of them are,  but she is.  Implied.  Yeah, exactly.  Why are you going to be saying that?  Well, you're both wrong.  I'm thinking she might have  some innocence to her  and she doesn't realize 
[03:06:00]  what she's involved with.  Yep.  She has no idea.  And that the other ladies  are looking to scissor with your mom  and she's not picking up  on the signs yet.  Well, she's not going to have  any of that shit.  What does she wear to the club?  Her jeans and her shirt.  I don't know.  Exactly.  Her shirt's not a skirt  with no panties?  No, it's not a skirt  with no panties.  No, it's jeans  and a flannel shirt.  That's the lesbian fucking outfit.  That's the lesbian tuxedo.  The lesbian uniform.  I have a lesbian tuxedo.  The lesbian uniform.  My mom's not a lesbian.  So what does she?  Your dad probably encourages it.  He probably squeezes his helmet 
[03:06:30]  and he's like,  what time are you going to the party?  That doesn't happen.  And it's okay if she's a lesbian.  It's okay.  I know it would be fine.  It's the year 2011.  Deal with it.  All that stuff is just fine.  She's no lesbian.  Yeah.  What do they do  at the women's club?  You know what they do  at the women's club.  See, Sam had to be  the smart ass  and he had to point out  that we were fucking  maybe stumbling  to the finish line.  So now we focus on you  and your lesbian mom.  She's not a lesbian.  What is she doing at the club?  What do they do  in this club?  You know what?  I think we're going overtime. 
[03:07:00]  I know.  Now we're going to fucking  now he picked up the ball.  We're running.  I don't know.  I'm not in the club.  Come on.  You know one activity  they do in the club.  Come on.  You talk to your mom.  Hey, what's new, mom?  Oh, I went to the ladies club  or whatever.  If she's not telling you  what kind of activities,  that means she can't think  quickly on our feet  and that there's some  stuff going on.  What's going on?  What did you do at the club?  Oh, we just listened  to Katie Lang songs.  They don't even listen  to music.  Sure they do.  I caught that joke.  That's a really good line.  She brought home flowers  once because she wanted  them in an auction 
[03:07:30]  at the club.  You know what the flowers  were for, Sam.  You're not that dumb.  No, it's for club.  She was the best lesbian  of the night.  You're the best lesbian  of the night, right?  It's for funding the club.  She scissored the best  that night.  They want to recruit  young members, but...  I bet.  Of course they do.  There's not any young  people in the club.  Supple.  Of course they want  young members.  Well, it's a social club.  Yeah, that's what  they call it.  It's just socially...  But what do they do?  She comes home with flowers  and no one's asking.  What do they do?  They're sitting around  and what happens? 
[03:08:00]  They kibitz.  What's kibitz?  It's like what women do.  Just talking?  Yeah.  So why is that a club?  They nibble each other's bits?  They don't nibble  each other's bits.  Is that what he said?  No, it's like sexual.  You said clits?  No, kibitz.  Oh, I thought he said  it's done with the clits.  Nothing.  Definitely nothing.  It's like a social club.  Oh, it's like a social club.  Maybe they bring in  a gentleman.  I don't think so.  They're all ladies.  Maybe they bring in  a gentleman  for some entertainment.  Oh, do you think  they do that?  And he comes in  and they... 
[03:08:30]  Women get alarmed.  They get alarmed at first  because they're like,  why is a police officer here?  Why is he...  He wants to arrest us  or something?  And then the guy  goes up to one of the ladies  and taps her  with the nightstick  and goes,  you...  And then grabs  the crotch of his pants  and the whole uniform  comes off.  And his big turd,  fat cock  is just swinging  in her face.  Wow, we decided  not to be subtle today,  I say.  It's not white.  So your mom goes home  and your dad says,  why does your hands,  face, and butt cheeks 
[03:09:00]  smell like cocoa butter?  Butt cheeks.  That's why the flowers.  She was able to get  the most whipped cream  off the members.  So you think...  You think this social club  is just having  an African-American...  Look, unless you start  talking, we're just  going to assume a lot  here, Sam Roberts.  What is going on  with this women's club?  It's a social get-together.  I love that her butt cheeks  smell like cocoa butter. 
[03:09:30]  There's only one way  that's happening.  Really deep grinding.  Her butt cheeks  have never smelled  differently  after going to a club  meeting.  Alrighty, I just...  Do you want to acknowledge  that the show fell apart  right before 10 again?  Yeah, is that what you want to do?  You ever want to do that  again, Sam?  You want to do that again, sir?  I'm just trying to do  my part to help.  Now, tell us what the fuck  happens at this club  because now I don't give a fuck  that we're in overtime.  I don't even care.  Nope.  They chit-chat.  About what?  Whatever the women talk about.  I don't go to the club.  See, this is the vagary  that she brings home with her.  Yep.  But I don't ask... 
[03:10:00]  That means some shit's going on.  You're not a little curious  as to what your mom  is doing at these things?  Why?  Because she would just  talk on and on and on  if I asked her questions about it.  Oh, should Mikey B  write to it?  Yeah.  Not good.  Sam's mom was arrested  this morning  selling apple pies  at Hunts Point.  Hunts Point.  That's where the whores  hang out.  Yeah, it's a local...  Oh, yes.  It's a local reference.  She's not going to sell  pies without a business license.  Do you think it's like those...  You know what I picture up?  You know those 
[03:10:30]  HBO sex specials  that used to be on?  Yes.  Where it's like,  okay, let's all gather  in the room.  Now let's all disrope.  And some old hippie bitches  at the front of the room  and telling all the other women  to take their clothes off.  Now just touch each other  and feel the energy.  And then you're hearing like...  Like moans and groans.  And then before you know it,  they're just licking box  and fucking...  And she's like,  yes, feel it.  And then the old bag  fucking hippie woman  gets involved  and starts like moving 
[03:11:00]  other people's head.  See, no, grab here.  Because she's getting off  with the whole thing.  Is there some direction  going on, Sam?  You know, people do have  social clubs  that don't involve sex.  Do you think your mother's  on an oriental rug  getting a massage  from a woman  who looks like B. Arthur?  I don't think so.  Rubbing Ben Gay  into her shoulders.  These are so sore.  Sam, you're a naive little boy.  You don't know.  Everything you do  in this world  goes to sex.  Yes.  One way or another.  Everything you do  in this world  we know what's been going on.  You don't know 
[03:11:30]  diddly squat.  You haven't told us  what she does at the club  so we got to assume all this.  I don't go to the clubs.  She just said it.  Diddly and squat.  That's exactly  what they do at the club.  They don't diddle or squat.  I'm going to pencil this  in for tomorrow, Ant.  Now ass play.  We got to talk to Sam's mom  about the social club.  We're going to get  into some ass play now  so all the ladies  roll over  and I'll come around  and I'm just going to  slowly stick a digit  in your butthole.  That's ridiculous.  Open your legs 
[03:12:00]  like you're skydiving.  I'm going to take  my thumb and forefinger.  Now the nails may pinch  this tender browning skin  and I'm going to open it up  with my thumb and forefinger  and then I'm going to  take the pointy finger  of my right hand  and just tickle it  as if it's a small rodent.  And I'll be careful  to avoid that bundle  of hemorrhoids.  Yes.  Now ladies,  some of you  might be a little  uncomfortable with this  at first, 
[03:12:30]  but if you are,  just look at Mrs. Roberts.  She's very comfortable  with this.  She's been here  many times  and just loves  the ass play segment.  Follow her lead.  Now if you feel  the urge to make  a whoopsie,  just breathe through it.  Accidents will happen.  You guys better be careful.  Have we made it  to 10 there, Sam?  What's the matter?  It's actually 10.03.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, that's too bad.  We got at least  10 more minutes to go.  You're going to lose  yourself a listener. 
[03:13:00]  I just love the idea  that the old ladies  are going to have to shit  and they just have to  warn them it's okay  to make a whoopsie.  Just do it.  It's a whoopsie.  The longer you do this,  the more you'll get used to it  and there won't be,  oh, look,  see, there's a whoopsie now.  There's one now.  Oh, Mrs. Johnson.  They have to pass around  the whoopsie towel,  which is a dark blue towel  that they just wipe  their fingers on  after a whoopsie happens.  Brown spots all over 
[03:13:30]  the white towel.  The room stinks.  And one of them  has to wash  the whoopsie towel  every week.  They can afford  more than one towel.  Sam, we're going to  talk to your mom tomorrow.  That's for sure.  She'll probably be able  to give you more details.  You think they talk about  common household items  that you could use  to pleasure yourself?  No, no.  You're sure?  Yeah.  I mean, they're old women.  How to masturbate  with the table corner  while everybody's sitting there  and they don't know  what you're doing.  Putting an uneven load  in the dryer 
[03:14:00]  and then leaning against it.  How to separate  your vaginal lips  on the corner of a table.  Do you want  you want to know  what Mikey wrote now?  No.  He says that  Sam's mom makes it  makes it to 10 every day.  I don't know  what that's supposed to mean.  That might be  some of that  double entendre humor  that the kids are using.  Very subtly do it.  So you could just  be around the house 
[03:14:30]  and separate  your vaginal lips  on the corner of a table.  Well, my table corners  are rounded, so.  Oh, God.  Well, we're certainly  going to talk to her  tomorrow about this.  This last 10 minutes  of the show  was very immature.  I bet you  there was one thing  where nobody wants  to get caught doing that.  I bet you that they had  one section called  how to get the stink  out of the end  of a rolling pin.  She wouldn't need  that quote. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, boy, Sam.  Well, don't old boy  Sam meet.  Oh, boy, Sam.  As if you didn't have  anything to do with this.  I had nothing to do  with this.  I just asked her  what your mom's up to.  And you told us  about the lesbian club.  How dare you?  I think the first thing  he said was  something about lesbians  and scissoring.  No, no.  The first thing he said  was, uh,  boy, yeah,  kind of rough  getting to 10 o'clock,  huh?  I think that was  the first thing.  And then he brought up  the fact that his mom  goes to these  women's dyke-off  binges.  That's not what, 
[03:15:30]  now you're totally  misconstruent.  Where they do ass play  and learn.  Does she have a uniform  when she goes there?  No, that's the time  you get the stink.  Does she have a uniform?  No, of course not.  She does.  It's ridiculous.  What time do you want  to talk to her tomorrow morning?  She doesn't like to wake up  before 8, 8, 30.  Hey, man,  if I got a nice key lime pie  sitting in front of me  tomorrow,  then hands off,  I'll leave your mom alone.  She doesn't give in  to her.  It's a dead giveaway  because when people  come home  and there's six cats  just licking one end  of the rolling pin,  everybody knows  what's been going on. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, does she pretend  she's baking  at these clubs?  No, she doesn't  pretend anything.  That's some shit  going on in it.  Yeah.  She brought home  snickerdoodles  from the last club.  Exactly.  Oh, that's it.  In the whoopsie towel.  Along with chlamydia.  Snickerdoodles.  That's what they call  the penis  of the black stripper.  Oh, someone's  going to get  snickerdoodles  on their face.  Someone's husband's  going to kiss them  with snickerdoodle  juice on them.  They use cute  older lady expressions. 
[03:16:30]  How long is she  at this club for?  I don't know.  All day?  No, not all day.  All day.  All fucking day.  All fucking day.  And she's not home  right now,  by the way, Sam.  We called.  And she's...  I mean, she's not home.  I'm sure she's home.  She probably just  doesn't want to  pick up the phone.  She's not home.  We called three times.  Helpful hints.  She's just want to  hear from you guys.  The ladies' club.  The women's club.  The women's club.  What do you do there?  I think we've 
[03:17:00]  described it perfectly.  You guys know all the answers.  You're just so smart.  They probably watch awful movies  like lady-oriented movies.  What was the traveling pants?  Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  Oh, there's anything  with Diane Keaton  after 1995  they think is hilarious.  Yeah, yeah.  Rotten parts.  Yeah, yeah.  Chick flicks there.  Chick flicks.  They all laugh.  Lights are out.  Fingers wander.  Each other's box.  I mean,  they might watch the movies  but the other stuff.  Do the lights go out?  I don't go to the clubs.  It's just a bunch of couches 
[03:17:30]  in the living room.  Everyone get comfortable.  Yeah.  Not in the living room.  Yeah.  It's little helpful things  they teach each other.  Wait, where's the club?  Not in the living room.  They got like a place.  How to make yourself  cum under a napkin.  That's insane.  Like a knitting junior sweater  for Christmas.  While the whole family  is sitting in front of you  watching TV.  How you can get yourself  off under the napkin.  Why would anybody  want to do that? 
[03:18:00]  There's a reason  those fucking needles  are so long.  How to make yourself  cum with the heel  of your own foot  under an napkin.  Probably trying to  masturbate in front of you.  We're going to find out  tomorrow, Sam.  Tomorrow, I should say.  We're talking to your mom  tomorrow.  Don't we have to do  the Bobo date tomorrow?  Nah.  Who is that bitch?  Who gives a fuck  about Bobo and his date?  We should talk about  Sam's mom and that  sex club that she  might be going to.  That's insane.  And the facts  will come out tomorrow. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  Exactly.  They're all trying to  invest in a fucking  one of those printers  that Jeff Dunham has.  Oh, no.  So they can scan  a big fist into it.  Look at Stern's logo  and they're like,  how do we make that  into a big plastic thing?  Going around to garages  trying to find mechanics.  No, not big enough.  Want a big long finger?  It's for the 
[03:19:00]  women's club.  Yeah.  We're going to  print something.  Big fist.  They don't do that,  you don't think,  Sam?  No, that's insane.  Why are you having  fun with this?  What's wrong with you?  I know.  You've got a rod.  I don't have,  no, I don't.  You always laugh  about everything, though.  Yeah, you're like  a party pooper.  You're a funny guy.  You like to laugh  during the after show,  you're laughing a lot  and everything.  I do laugh a lot,  but this has taken  a turn for the worse.  What?  And it's distasteful.  I don't laugh at things  that are distasteful.  I don't know.  I think I...  And, quite frankly,  it's immature 
[03:19:30]  and beneath me.  Can we just play this bit  over and over again  during the replay?  Yeah, please.  Please.  I love the idea.  No.  No, we can't.  It's hilarious.  Wow.  No, massages.  Oh, yeah.  Just fucking...  There's some shit going on.  A lot of smelling.  You don't smell.  I mean...  You might have to have...  Embrace your natural scent.  Yeah, yeah.  They have a douche-burning ceremony.  That's just ridiculous.  Why is that ridiculous?  They just want to smell like...  It's so probable. 
[03:20:00]  ...like pure womanhood  that's been, you know,  sweaty and...  You guys are totally  out of touch  with your feminine audience.  They have a speaker  come in and says,  don't be ashamed  of the slug trail.  Embrace yourself.  Some of them  who get extra wet  are embarrassed  and they need little marks.  Little fucking...  Little clear plastic tape marks.  They don't want them  cleaning off, though,  after they get wet.  They want a girl  to get wet  and then dry up again,  get wet and dry  so it gets all, like, nasty.  Yeah, so her thighs 
[03:20:30]  feel like fruit roll-ups.  How would you know?  That is horrible.  Rubber cement-y.  Yeah.  Get it all gooey.  All right, Sam.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks for putting out.  Did we do all right?  Thanks for putting out  we needed material.  You got it.  We got a good fucking  15 minutes out of that, at least.  Do you think that's the code word  they use when they're  massaging each other?  What?  Like, if one's getting turned on,  she'll giggle and go,  I'm getting gooey.  I'm getting a little gooey.  That's a terrible code word.  And they just  mush their face  into their open butt cheeks.  There's no reason 
[03:21:00]  to have a code word  if it's, I'm gooey.  There's a lot of fucking  horrible yoga queefs  going on.  Downward dog.  You don't do yoga.  It's not a fitness group.  It is.  You don't know  what they do.  You don't know.  I know what they don't do.  I know what they don't do.  I'll bet you they put  towels under the door  so the queefs  don't leave the room.  Embrace your natural scent.  Sun salutation.  That's insane.  The whole room  just, oh,  the smell in that place 
[03:21:30]  when they're done.  Yeah, the whole room  smells like a catfish burped.  We gave you an opportunity  to tell us.  It's like a cannery.  It smells like cannery row.  We gave you an opportunity  to tell us exactly  what happens at this fucking club.  You know what my mom  does at those clubs?  So now we have to assume.  None of your business.  We're going to find out tomorrow  because your mom  loves being on the radio  and she will be on this show tomorrow.  Oh yeah, she will.  And she'll tell us.  Not with that type of talk.  What time?  Should we pen it in for 7.30?  She doesn't like getting up that early.  Oh, really?  A little tired 
[03:22:00]  from the women's club.  I know where the club is,  by the way.  Oh, where?  It's in Tampa.  September 29th  or October 1st.  Wow.  I will be there  performing the Tampa Improv  and then October 23-22  Pittsburgh Improv  in Homestead, PA.  Damn.  Yes.  It's right across the street  from where E-Roc grew up,  by the way.  And possibly a New Jersey date  coming up next month early.  Oh!  Have a good day, everyone.  Bye!  Take it easy.  We're right here  to proclaim Monday,  September 19th, 2011 
[03:22:30]  to be WBZ Radio Day  in the city of Worcester.  Seriously?  XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. </pre>
