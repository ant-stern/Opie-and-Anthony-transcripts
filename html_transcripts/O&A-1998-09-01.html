<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a caller claiming to have slept with a vast number of New York City radio personalities, estimating around 75% of FM DJs and half of C100's staff.  The hosts then launched a contest for Pearl Jam concert tickets, the prize to be awarded to the listener who brought the most unusual guest or item to the studio. Initial options included livestock – a pig, goat, cow, or chicken – or a celebrity.

A caller then suggested a truly bizarre alternative: a naked woman and eggs, with the intent of attempting to incubate the eggs in the woman's breasts.  While initially incredulous, the hosts agreed to consider this entry if the caller could make it to the studio in time.

The show then shifted to a comedic segment featuring Anthony's surprisingly accurate Ronald Reagan impression.  This led to the hosts successfully obtaining George H.W. Bush's personal number in Kennebunkport, Maine, and subsequently attempting a prank call impersonating Reagan, leading to a humorous (though unspecified) exchange.

The Pearl Jam ticket contest resumed.  A listener ultimately won the tickets by bringing in a baby duckling.  Anthony's unexpectedly gentle interaction with the duckling became a recurring joke, especially after a friend revealed Anthony had eaten a mandarin duck over the weekend, creating a humorous contrast.  The show concluded with further discussion of the Reagan impersonation, the unorthodox Pearl Jam ticket contest entries, and more general banter between Opie and Anthony.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Because, just do.  Well, give us a reason.  The reason is, I need to dine with one of you guys.  So, that means have sex with us?  No, just eat with you guys.  Are you kind of hot?  Well, I'm good looking. I feel like that.  What does that matter, Opie?  I go for looks. I'm not going to sit here and make believe I don't.  Do you have, like, big ass?  I'll let you see that when we do meet, if you want to meet me.  I should say, everyone that I've met in radio likes what they see.  Actually, they love what they see. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, so you do the radio guys?  I pretty much met every single radio station, disc jockey, on the FM in New York City.  Which they all say they made the number one market.  And how many of them have you done?  About 75% of them.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Now, who have you had sex with?  Well, let's just say, half of the C100 staff.  I don't want to tell you anything.  No, go ahead. Well, you know, we like hearing this.  Oh, really?  Yeah. Who else?  Um, I went to KTU. I went to Howard Stern, his morning show. That was kind of cool. 
[00:01:00]  And I've had sex with some female jocks, too.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm not, I don't feel like being part of your list. Sorry.  No.  No, we're going to have to pass on the, um, the radio whore girl.  I'm not a whore, right?  Radio whore.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with R.E.M.  Don't go back to Rockville off Reckoning.  And Shiny Happy People from Out of Time.  New R.E.M. CD coming in October.  But the boys will not be touring in support of the album, unfortunately. 
[00:01:30]  Why?  I think they'll, I think they'll pop up from, in a few areas with a few live dates, I'm sure.  But they're not going to go for a full-fledged tour in this moment in time, anyway, so.  It's Opie and Anthony, we are still waiting for livestock to show up to the N.E.W. studios for the Pearl Jam tickets.  Anthony, this is an easy contest, right?  I thought it would be easy.  It's, uh, you come down to the N.E.W. studios with some livestock, a pig, a goat, cow, chicken, and we'll give you Pearl Jam tickets. 
[00:02:00]  Simple as that, yeah.  Maybe we should send Rick down to the bottom.  Maybe they won't let the, uh, the farm animals into the building.  Maybe we're having a problem, yeah.  Won't let them on the elevator.  Can you imagine if someone got a cow up here?  That would be pretty cool.  That would be.  But you also have another way to win the Pearl Jam tickets.  You've got to bring us a celebrity.  Yeah.  So it's either bring us livestock or bring us a celebrity for the tickets to see Pearl Jam.  Easy.  Hottest ticket in town.  And for the people out there going, there's no way in the world you guys are going to get livestock down to the N.E.W. studios. 
[00:02:30]  Well, if it doesn't happen, all the tickets that we have today is going to carry over for tomorrow's contest.  Because we have like five pairs a day we're giving away here.  All right?  Yeah.  Actually, there's a guy on the line.  He's got an interesting idea.  What?  He's got some eggs.  And he's got a voluptuous woman.  Voluptuous.  Voluptuous.  Voluptuous.  Voluptuous woman.  All right.  She's got big hooters.  And this guy wants to do a little experiment. 
[00:03:00]  He wants to bring the girl down with the eggs.  Okay.  And he wants to put like the eggs in her bosom and see if they'll hatch before seven o'clock for the Pearl Jam tickets.  That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.  Come on.  Why is it ridiculous?  You can't hatch eggs like that.  I've heard it done before.  And we are looking for the livestock.  So technically, if the eggs hatch in this girl's bosom, she would win the Pearl Jam tickets.  I.N.E.W., what do you got?  Okay.  I got eggs. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  I got a naked lady.  A naked girl.  With you?  Yeah.  Bring them up.  When am I going to get my Pearl Jam tickets?  I don't know.  If the eggs hatch, yes, you will get them.  Wait.  You really have eggs and a naked girl and she's going to try to hatch the eggs?  I can do that.  How big are her breasts?  Big enough to incubate an egg in under ten minutes.  Oh, perfect.  Come on up.  We'll give it a try.  All right.  I'll see if I can make it there.  I got to get a taxi right now.  All right.  You got to get up here immediately. 
[00:04:00]  But I'm downtown on West 4th Street.  Well, get jumping a cab.  It should take you in 20 minutes.  All right.  All right, man.  Okay.  Now, that is something I want to say.  All right.  There's something sick and twisted about that, but...  Come on.  Come on.  You got your digital camera, hopefully?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Very good.  So, hopefully, the guy with the naked lady and the eggs will show up before the show is  over so we can check that out.  Okay?  Cool.  On the way, we got two-fers from the cars and Led Zeppelin next.  Stay there.  1027 WNAW. 
[00:04:30]  They'll rock in New York.  Tuka Tuesday with the cars.  Don't you stop and shake it up.  It's Opie and it's Anthony.  Hey.  And it's a very, very sad day.  Ronald Reagan's dog died.  Yes.  Well, he was the best damn phone I ever had.  No, no, no.  He was what?  Yes?  No, Mr. President.  Yes?  He was your pet.  He wasn't your phone.  That was a fine shoe. 
[00:05:00]  I used to take him with me everywhere.  In the bathtub and to Jupiter.  Yes, hello, Mr. Gorbachev.  Teared down that hair weave.  No, no.  Your dog's name was Rex.  I'm a little rascal.  Hello, you're my little rascal.  Hello.  What a mess.  Yes, here, Rex.  Nancy.  Nancy, why isn't Rex moving?  No, Rex is dead.  He's very, he's tired today because we were out playing on the Rose Garden yesterday. 
[00:05:30]  And, well, he's a little tired, old bingo.  No, no, no.  Bingo.  You haven't been to Washington in many years, Mr. Reagan.  Your dog was 13 years old and he's now dead.  The communist menace must be stopped.  And, well, spot who was a good, here, Katie, Katie Rex.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Yes?  While we have you in the studio, President, what do you think of Clinton and the sex capades 
[00:06:00]  in the Oval Office?  You would have never done anything like that, right?  No, no, I think, I think Kennedy's doing a fine job in the office and I know someday when  I become president, where's Rex?  Rex is dead.  Nancy.  And, and Kennedy's not in the office anymore.  Yes.  It's Clinton.  They both do broads, but Kennedy was banging, Kennedy was banging starlets.  Very good abroad.  When I traveled abroad. 
[00:06:30]  All right, all right.  And brought peace to, where the hell was that?  Well.  Where's, spot?  Well, well.  Bingo.  Well, Mr. President.  Nancy, yes.  I got, um.  Let me just say this into the microphone.  No, no, no.  The microphone's over here.  What's, hello?  Yeah, right there.  Yes.  Stay right there.  Operator.  No, no, no.  Could you guess what?  Okay, listen.  Listen closely.  Okay?  Closely, yes.  I got the phone number of, uh, your vice president.  Who?  Herbert Hoover?  No.  Yes, Mike.  George Bush, who, uh, went on to be president, obviously. 
[00:07:00]  I got his.  We will win, me and George Bush in 1980.  I guarantee.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Yes, Mike.  What?  Listen, listen, listen.  Yes.  Okay.  I got his phone number.  His office phone number.  Would you like to talk to George Bush?  Yes, please.  Maybe he can console you over the loss of your dog, Rex.  Where's Rex?  He's not lost.  Put George through.  All right.  Well, it's ringing, so, um, well, start talking, I think. 
[00:07:30]  Hello?  Hello?  Hi, this is Ronald Reagan.  I'd like to speak with George, please.  Is there something I can help you with, sir?  He is in Kennebuntport, Maine, out of the office.  Well, could I have that number then, please?  It's 207-650.  Okay.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Oh, my God!  What a f***ing idiot!  Oh, my God. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, no.  You've got to be kidding me.  Sir George Bush?  Hi, this is Ronald Reagan.  Can I speak with George, please?  He is not here today.  Can I take a message?  No.  Well, you...  Do you have a number where he can call you back?  No, well, he knows my number.  I just...  Well, I guess I'll try back.  You know when he'll be in?  He's traveling all day today, and he'll be back in the office tomorrow.  Okay, I'll try then. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye.  Oh, we were so close!  I thought I was going to be able to find Rex.  Yes.  George Bush was a fine man.  When did you say he passed on?  Wait, wait, wait.  Can I have Anthony back for a second, Mr. President?  Yes.  Hello.  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.  What?  He almost talked to the president of the United States of America.  What is that, a woman insane?  He just gave out his private number at Kenny Buckport. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, my God.  Do you realize how close we were?  We're going to have to try that again tomorrow, man.  That is unbelievable.  That impression is so unbelievable that off our CD, Demented World, we called the Reagan  Library once in California, and they completely bought that they were talking to the ex-president  of the United States.  Yeah, because Nancy was showing up the next day.  Yes.  And I kept asking, well, Reagan kept asking, where's mommy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they were like, she's going to be here tomorrow, Mr. President. 
[00:09:30]  You know, we haven't played that call in a very long time.  We'll try to get it on before the end of the show.  It's priceless.  In honor of Rex, his dog.  Yes.  And we're going to try these numbers again and see if we can get the ex-president on  the air today.  Here's the spot.  All right.  Two for Tuesday.  Up next, we've got two from Creed.  Stay there.  1027 WNAW, the rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with two from the debut CD from Creed.  That's What's This Life For?  And My Own Prison.  It's Opie and Anthony Creed coming to town with fuel September 15th to Roseland.  It's going to be a very, very good show. 
[00:10:00]  And maybe we could get the boys in the imaginary ballroom to play a couple of those ditties for  us.  That'd work.  That would be very cool.  All right.  Wow.  A lot of things going on here today.  We almost talked to the ex-president of the United States of America by accident.  So close.  Maybe tomorrow.  Yeah, maybe tomorrow.  We do get some numbers now.  If you were listening a little while ago, Anthony went into his Reagan impression, which is  absolutely amazing how good that one is.  Thank you.  And we called the office of George Bush and he wasn't there. 
[00:10:30]  And the secretary gave us his private number in Kennebunkport.  And just by the luck of the draw, he wasn't in Kennebunkport when we called.  So we're going to try maybe tomorrow or later on in the show to get him on the line.  Get some bush.  Can you imagine if he's on the line and he thinks he's talking to Reagan?  I don't know.  That'd be pretty huge.  You'd scare me.  Yeah.  Secret Service will come and wrestle me to the ground.  Also, we got tons of Pearl Jam tickets still left here.  Mm-hmm.  Gave all our tickets away yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  Today we are looking for livestock.  And a bunch of people are on their way down here.  But so far, no one has arrived with the livestock or the celebrity.  Can you believe it?  No livestock and no celebrity.  No.  And if we don't get anyone to come by with the livestock or the celebrities today, we  will just carry over all these tickets tomorrow.  Until tomorrow, yes.  And we'll have like 10 pairs to give away tomorrow.  But for today, I mean, you still have an hour and 20 minutes.  We're looking for either a live chicken, a live goat, a live mule, a live cow, or a live 
[00:11:30]  pig.  Of the large, smelly variety, by the way.  No guinea pigs.  The guy that came by before with Dice.  And that didn't qualify as a celebrity.  No, he turned him away.  Actually, Dice just kind of hangs out in our lobby anyway.  And it was almost livestock because he's a jackass.  He just kind of hangs out in the lobby hoping we would put him on the air.  But every once in a while, we'll throw him on.  I know.  We don't put him on, though.  But no.  No.  Not today, Dice.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:12:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Close the door.  Thank you.  We don't need him today.  Thanks a lot.  You could bring by a bona fide celebrity and we'll give you tickets to Pearl Jam.  Mm-hmm.  But we've got to make sure it's a real celebrity.  A real one.  And also, supposedly, a guy's coming down here with a girl and eggs.  A girl's going to get naked.  She's going to put the eggs in her breast.  And try to hatch them.  And try to hatch the eggs for Pearl Jam tickets.  So that way it'll be livestock.  Yeah.  It'll be little chickens.  Yes. 
[00:12:30]  He called.  He's stuck in traffic, but he's going to try to make it down as well.  All right.  Hey, we've got Stock Broker Dave on the line.  Ooh, explaining the day's events.  Yes.  Stock Market closed 288 points up.  Let's see what he has to say here.  Stock Broker Dave.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Well, first of all, me and Anthony want to bow to you.  Why?  A couple weeks ago, you said that the market was going to be in trouble in the very near future.  And look what happened yesterday.  Hey, even a broken clock is right twice a day.  Do you have any livestock sightings today?  No, not yet.  But listen, there was a guy that called yesterday. 
[00:13:00]  And he wants to personally thank you because of your advice you gave a couple weeks ago on our show.  He got all his money out of the market and saved a bloody fortune.  Get out of here.  I swear to you.  So is he going to buy me a drink?  He wants your number.  He ain't getting it.  There you go.  He ain't getting it, but he's very welcome.  All right.  So the stock market closed $288,000 up.  Up $288,000 on $1.2 billion.  What are you thinking?  What are you thinking?  What's in your mind right now, Dave?  Right now, I'm going to see Joe Cocker.  And I'm thinking about the three martinis and the ten bonk hits I'm going to have. 
[00:13:30]  According to that, it's going to be choppy.  Yeah.  Over the next couple of days, it's going to be trading between $7,500 and $8,000 until  anybody gets a clue what the hell is going on.  Uh-huh.  And what does the future look like?  Like down the road a little ways more with Asia and Russia and turmoil.  Anthony, this is down.  We got hit pretty good.  Yeah.  It's safe to go back in the water.  I mean, your bottom here is $7,300.  You've got some good buying opportunities here.  Yeah, I know.  I just got to figure out what they are. 
[00:14:00]  I got like $200 now I can invest.  Cool.  Everything that's down does come back.  That's true.  I mean, but then you take a look at Microsoft.  Now's a good time for Microsoft.  Dell.  Dell is down $30.  Yeah.  It's got to go back.  It's got to go back up.  Cool.  Now, Dave, you're still in for the $290 if the girl shows her breasts on the Today Show.  But I can't believe nobody showed you any livestock today.  I thought definitely somebody would come up with a great tip.  You liked that yesterday?  I loved that one yesterday.  Cool.  I mean, I think you guys are a little out of bounds with the colored guy. 
[00:14:30]  Can you believe that?  Oh, Opie, where the hell did you grow up?  I don't know.  Opie grew up in Mississippi in the 60s.  Colored folk?  The last time they were called colored folk was before they turned the hoses on.  I don't understand what Opie's saying, colored.  Colored folk?  I didn't know what to say.  It's better than Negroes.  Negroes?  I thought that was going to be next.  I didn't say that.  But now, Dave, we're still waiting for someone to come by with some livestock for the Pearl Jam ticket.  Cool.  Well, can I say hello to a friend of mine who's pretty sick, guys? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, hit it.  My partner, Patty Diggins, loves his dad very much, and he's not doing too well.  But, Mr. Diggins, we all love you, and we hope you get better.  All right.  We appreciate that, boys.  All right, Dave, we've got to let you fly for now.  Take care, boys.  Take it easy.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  1027-WNEW, The Rock of New York, 2 for Tuesday with Billy Idol.  It's Opie and Anthony, and we have some livestock in the studio.  If you're just tuning in, we're asking people to come on by the NEW studios with some form of livestock to win tickets to see Pearl Jam.  And Gil has arrived with a baby duck. 
[00:15:30]  It's a little baby duckling.  Gil, where did you get this baby duck?  I got it from a live poetry in the Bronx and Jerome Avenue.  You got a little duckling in the Bronx?  They're selling ducklings in the Bronx, huh?  Yeah.  I'm giving them a little drink.  Oh, how cute.  It is.  It's very cute.  All right.  What are you doing with this thing when you're done with it?  Yeah, what are you doing with this?  Do no neck snapping.  No, I'm always like I'll give it to my little cousins so they can play around with it. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, great.  Give it to your little cousins so they can play around with it.  That doesn't sound good.  What, little guy?  You're going to have Pete on her ass in a minute here.  But, all right.  Well, you're going to win the tickets to see Pearl Jam.  Our first winner of the day, huh, Ben?  Yes.  Wow.  All right.  You still have an hour to come on by with either a celebrity, a known celebrity, or a,  ah, there he is, or another form of livestock before 7 o'clock.  Let me see this thing.  I haven't even seen it yet.  Here's the box.  So be careful.  I'm fine.  Let me just, let me just, oh, look at the one. 
[00:16:30]  Look, isn't he cute?  Wait, what are you doing, you idiot?  Oh, my God.  I feel so good.  How are you?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you alive?  Oh, my God.  Don't move.  I'll go get you a towel.  That is sick.  Wait a minute.  Did you drop the box on the sound?  Yeah, I did.  But it turned out okay, actually.  I guess so.  All right.  Well, we've got to thank Gil for coming on by with the little duckling. 
[00:17:00]  All right, wait a minute.  And I think the big duck just molested the little duck, and I think that's very illegal somewhere in the world.  We have your phone number, right?  Yes.  Okay.  I want to call this guy before the concert, and I want to hear this duck cheeping into the phone,  or you're not going to the concert.  I don't want you pulling any shenanigans.  Oh, look at him, cutie's drinking.  Oh, look at Anthony.  What a pause.  Look at him.  He's very cute.  He's fuzzy.  What a pause.  I don't want anything happening to the poor little guy. 
[00:17:30]  All right, that's fine, but you don't have to act like a little pause.  What a pause.  I just don't like little ducklings.  I'll eat them when they get older, but they're cute when they're small.  Look at him.  Look, now the girls are in.  And they're all saying how cute he is.  These girls will kick your ass if anything happens to this duckling.  All right.  Isn't he cute?  Oh, I hate when girls make little noises when they see a little pet.  Wow.  All right.  Well, Gil, congratulations.  I think you got the tickets to Pearl Jam, all right? 
[00:18:00]  You think or am I going to have them?  You bet as long as nothing happens to that duck.  You'll be all right as long as nothing happens.  You'll be hell to pay.  All right.  Thank you.  And get Eddie Vedder out there and tell the crowd to beat you to a pulp.  That's how he feels about animals.  And everyone else has about 55 minutes to get more livestock down in the studio to claim  their Pearl Jam tickets.  Beep.  On the way.  I don't even know what we're doing next.  Beep.  Oh, we'll do two from Tom Petty.  Stay there.  Beep.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with Tom Petty into the Great Wide Open.  And don't come around here no more. 
[00:18:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks.  You got 45 minutes left to come by with some more livestock to claim your tickets to see  the sold-out Pearl Jam show.  Yeah.  All right?  It's Opie and Anthony, like I said.  And I hope he's nice to that duck.  Well, we had Gil come by and he found a duck in the Bronx.  Not a duck.  Actually, a duckling.  A duckling.  It was like about four inches long.  Yes.  A little cute little fuzzy yellow duck head.  A little duck bill.  And he just peeped. 
[00:19:00]  You're such a puss.  Well, I like it.  When did you get so sensitive?  Baby animals are cute and I don't like to think that he's a...  Oh, please.  You know, two steps out the elevator, he's pulling the old snap the neck and, you know,  off the Pearl Jam.  Well, I don't want to see that happen either, but you're just such a puss.  What are you talking about?  Because I hope that no harm comes to a little baby animal?  You're this brave radio DJ in New York with all these pretty sick, edgy opinions.  Nothing matter.  And you're over a box with a duckling inside going... 
[00:19:30]  I was talking to the little duck.  And petting it and stuff.  I was embarrassed.  Hey, I eat veal.  Come on.  Why don't you go put a tutu on me?  Oh, shut up.  He was cute.  He was a baby duck.  What am I supposed to do?  What, are you going to go home and, like, pet your little duckling and watch Titanic and  cry and put the Celine Dion soundtrack on your butt?  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to do.  Right, right.  What would you have me do?  Hit him with a rock?  What?  He was sitting there peeping.  I'm looking at him. 
[00:20:00]  Scratch his little head.  So, Ed, you like ducks?  Peep, peep.  It was cute.  A little duckling.  You like little ducklings, huh?  Yeah.  Okay.  So?  I've got to ask you a question.  What does that make?  I've got to ask you a question, Ed.  Why?  Okay.  What did you have for dinner over the weekend?  Well, I don't know.  I don't remember.  No, no, no.  What did you have for dinner over the weekend?  I guess Friday I had steak.  I had a big steak.  That was good.  You had nothing else for dinner over the weekend?  Saturday, um...  Anthony, the sensitive one that's petting and cooing over a little duckling. 
[00:20:30]  You had nothing else to eat this past weekend.  I don't know what you're talking about.  You sure?  Yeah.  You're positive.  Positive.  Are you positive?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I don't remember.  I'd probably, you know, just have, like, sandwiches or something.  Maybe pizza.  All right.  Why?  What are you getting at?  I'm getting at something.  What?  I got a friend of yours on hold here.  Where?  Over there.  I can't figure out how to get him on the air here.  All right. 
[00:21:00]  Really?  Yeah.  What does he say?  Huh?  He said...  I'll put him on next, I guess.  Earl, come here.  How do I get this phone on the air?  I screwed up a button here.  You sure?  You sure?  I'm sure.  That you only had steak for dinner this weekend?  Yeah.  Steak and pizza.  And pizza.  That I remember.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  And you were cooing over the little, uh, the duckling in the studio, right?  It was cute.  Randy.  Hello?  Randy.  Hi.  Don't curse.  We got you live on the air.  Oh, okay.  Randy, one of, uh, Anthony's very good friends. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, we were hanging out this weekend.  Now, Randy, did you hear Anthony cooing over the little duckling in the studio?  Yeah, I did.  It's very cute.  Right.  Now, tell the...  Oh, it's a cute little duckling.  Now, Randy, tell the whole world what Anthony had for dinner over the weekend.  Um, Sunday night, he had a mandarin duck.  And he said it was delicious.  Well, you're a hypocrite, man.  That's different, because it's full grown.  Damn, it would have brown sauce and mushrooms. 
[00:22:00]  It was, like, really good.  It was good.  I tasted it, too.  Yeah.  But, you know, Anthony, the little ones are so much more tender.  Duckling McNuggets.  All right, turning me in, Randy.  You're such a hypocrite.  All right.  I'm sorry.  All right, Randy.  Thanks.  Okay.  Later.  All right.  I got you.  You're such a loser.  What?  It was a duckling, not a full grown...  Oh, forget it.  Two for Tuesday, coming back with two from Soundgarden. 
[00:22:30]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Two for Tuesday with Soundgarden, Burden in My Hand, and Black Hole Sun.  And it's Opie and Anthony.  We're having a lot of fun today.  Lots going on on the show today.  Certainly is.  We got to get back into this Reagan thing.  Yes.  Where's my puppy?  Well, it all started...  We read in the paper that Reagan lost his dog Rex.  Had him for 13 years.  Where did I put him?  Probably with my mind. 
[00:23:00]  Nancy.  I don't even want to go through this again.  No one's eating the dog food I put out.  Is this what Nancy goes through every day, you think?  Yes.  Trying to, like, get a conversation going with you, Mr. Reagan?  Does she?  Who the hell's Nancy?  Oh, my God.  Anyway, we decided to call George Bush's office as the President of the United States.  And George Bush wasn't there, but they gave us his private number in Kennebunkport. 
[00:23:30]  Kennebunkport.  So then Reagan called there, and they pretty much told him to call back tomorrow.  He'll be there.  Yeah.  So we're going to try that tomorrow.  We'll try tomorrow.  We're going to search.  The point I'm trying to make here, this isn't the first time that we've pulled one over on somebody,  you know, when you did your Reagan impersonation.  Yes.  Well, for me, it'll be hearing it the first time, because I can't quite remember when I first heard it. 
[00:24:00]  Halfway through, you may have to start it again.  Okay.  We can do that for you, Mr. President.  But, yeah, we have...  The President's here?  Where?  Oh, my God.  Help me.  Hey, what do you think of Monica Lewinsky, Mr. President?  He's a fine man, and he'll make a great Secretary of State.  Okay, thank you.  Anyway, offer a CD, Demanded World.  A CD, by the way, you can't buy in New York for some reason.  I know.  That's a great record company we got. 
[00:24:30]  Sells everywhere else in the country, but the place we're at and broadcasting from, you can't find the things.  I would kill to be on, like, K-Tel Records at this point.  I want to be on Rhino Records or something.  We're on Screw Them Good and Hard record company.  So, if you can find the CD, it's filled with some laughs.  Good luck finding it.  It's called Opie and Anthony's The Meta World.  And there was another time that Reagan pulled one over on someone.  It was the time he called his own library in California, the Reagan Library, looking for his wife, Nancy. 
[00:25:00]  Check this out.  27W, NW, The Wreck of New York on 2 for Tuesday, finishing up our show.  With Jimmy Hendrix, Voodoo Chow with The Slight Return and The Wind Cries Mary.  It's Opie and Anthony just about out the door.  I've got to thank Gil Evar of Jersey for bringing by the baby duckling that Anthony fell in love with.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You did.  I thought it was a very cute little duckling. 
[00:25:30]  Yes.  Fall in love with.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to have a bestiality sex with a duck, Opie.  I picture you're going home with the little duckling.  You're going to pet it.  It's warped fantasies.  You're going to pet it.  You're going to put it on your little pink tutu.  You're going to put it on your Titanic video that you just bought.  You probably stayed, you know, was online last night at midnight with all the other lovely ladies to get the Titanic video.  And you're going to have a lovely night tonight.  This making you hot talking about me like this?  Because, to tell you the truth, I never think of you in a pink tutu. 
[00:26:00]  You can think of me like that all you want.  Whatever gets you off.  Hey, the listeners agree with me today.  You showed your very sensitive side today and it was very scary.  You were petting the little duckling and cooing and worrying about its cooing.  Did I ever go, grrr, grrr.  All right, you went, grrr, grrr.  What did I do?  Do that again.  What?  What?  I'm not doing it again.  So, I pet a little baby duck.  And you were worried about its welfare.  I just didn't want the guy snapping its neck when he got off the elevator. 
[00:26:30]  And then a little later on in the show, we found out that you had duck for dinner over the weekend.  It is a grown duck and they taste very good.  I see.  I just don't want a little baby duck killed so this guy can get Pearl Jam tickets.  But it's okay if the duck grows up and then it's killed so you should have it free.  Yeah, that's all.  I don't care.  Right.  As long as they're cute.  Cute animals don't kill.  Kill the ugly animals.  That's fine.  Kill the ugly animals.  I'm fine with that.  Okay.  Like cow, veal, I don't care. 
[00:27:00]  Put them in the box.  Oh.  Tenderize them.  Yeah, you're the same person.  Oh, forget it.  You're a mess.  Well, I'm not a militant animal rights activist.  I don't even like animal rights activists.  You're a mess because you...  But when you get a cute little duckling going peep, peep, peep at you, what are you going to do?  Drop a brick on it?  Huh?  I don't know.  There he is.  Is the cute little duck safe?  You're an idiot.  Because you're the same guy.  I am.  The same guy as what?  That goes to the restaurant. 
[00:27:30]  And not only does Anthony order veal, he likes to make sure the whole restaurant knows he's ordering veal.  Having veal!  Veal here!  And every waitress gives you that look like, oh, I know it's on the menu, but do you have to order it so?  Top of the food chain, pally.  I understand.  I'm sure if an alien came down here and found us tasty, we'd be flambéed too.  Just so happened that this time and place, we are the top of the food chain.  Something walks in front of me, I'll eat it. 
[00:28:00]  I understand that.  But the duckling McNugget wasn't quite big enough to chow down on, so I didn't think the guy should, you know, snap its neck or anything.  Okay, that's all right.  Well, thanks.  But you don't find little animal, baby animals cute?  They're all right.  They're all right.  I'll check them out.  You're warped, man.  I know.  Who wouldn't think a little baby animal would be cute?  It was cool to see, yeah.  So you look at it, you tap its little head, it opens its little bill, I was feeding him water.  Dude, you were talking to the thing and petting it.  I was just saying you want some water and putting it on my finger and he was eating, feeling like drinking the water off my finger. 
[00:28:30]  Homo.  Homo.  Yeah, that makes me a homo.  I didn't say nothing.  I heard you.  What did I say?  I heard you.  I said nothing.  Fine.  Tell all the guys at the Glory Hole when you visit tonight what makes you a homo.  What?  Saying that a duck is cute or what you're going to be doing.  Pickle Spock.  No, man.  You going to the dance club tonight?  Butler. 
[00:29:00]  Anyway.  Yeah, felt like a duck.  Okay.  Yeah, we got to congratulate Gil from Jersey for bringing by the duck.  Yeah, thanks, Gil.  That Anthony fell in love with.  Yeah, fell in love with it.  Yeah, we're getting married.  Marrying a duck.  Well, anyways, you know what rhymes with duck, Opie?  Take that and you at the end of it, okay?  Duck you.  Okay.  Go duck yourself.  Very good.  You're a ducking idiot.  Very nice.  I like that.  Okay, good.  Also, I got to congratulate Nick from New York.  Nick Mira.  Mira. 
[00:29:30]  Something like that.  He won the Pearl Jam tickets, too.  Giving away Pearl Jam tickets all week long on the Opie and Anthony show.  And tomorrow, I think we're going to use the phone.  Because there's a lot of people outside Manhattan that want to chance.  They have tickets, too.  So we'll come up with some fun phone games.  They don't like the fact that they have to come down here.  Well, I understand that.  It's tough.  And we want to make it fair for everyone.  So tune in tomorrow at 3 to find out what you got to do tomorrow to win the Pearl Jam tickets.  Very good.  Okay.  All right, Opie.  You asshole.  Homos.  Anyway. 
[00:30:00]  I agree.  Okay, homo.  Okay.  You're a jerk.  Shut up. </pre>
