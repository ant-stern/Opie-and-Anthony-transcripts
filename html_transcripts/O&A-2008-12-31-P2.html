<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a phone interview with Ricky Gervais, promoting his movie *Ghost Town*.  Gervais discussed the film, his nonchalant attitude towards global warming ("it's definitely going to happen, but I'm going to be dead"), and his experiences with the British press. He shared a humorous anecdote about Louis C.K.'s terrifying experience on a turbulent flight after forgetting his keys. The hosts also referenced a previous, unrecorded incident involving Gervais, a homeless man, the Queen, and Condoleezza Rice.  In-studio guest Roland then gave a positive review of *Ghost Town*, and the hosts discussed the film's differing US and UK release dates, touching upon the challenges of comedy regarding race and cultural sensitivities between the two countries. Opie admitted to a past embarrassing moment where he mistook Gervais discussing *Extras* for *The Office* outtakes.

The show then transitioned into the highly anticipated "Musical Dildos" (or "Musical Dildo Chairs") segment.  The hosts, along with frequent guest John Valby (found initially asleep in a car sent by the show), discussed the logistical nightmare of the late-arriving dildos.  The segment involved significant banter and an ongoing "ass contest," punctuated by numerous sexually explicit limericks, poems, and jokes.  Valby performed several original, heavily censored songs with sexually suggestive lyrics.  The difficulty in attracting female contestants for "Musical Dildo Chairs" led to on-air begging and offers of cash prizes and a trip to Wrestlemania.  As a backup, the "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge," involving lubricating and inserting a wiffle ball bat into a condom, was introduced.  Multiple women participated in both challenges and the "Best Ass Contest," with "Dr. Stinky" taking measurements in the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Krista initially held the record, only to be surpassed by another contestant. Nikki ultimately won the "Musical Dildo Chairs" competition. The segment also included a brief interlude playing a segment of 8-track audio pornography, and was rife with vulgar and offensive language throughout.  The hosts frequently checked a dump counter, tracking flagged segments.  The show also referenced a previous segment, the "Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge," and the overall tone was one of raucous laughter and explicit commentary.  The recurring character "G.I. Joe" also contributed to the chaotic atmosphere.

Following the contests, the show played an audio recording of what seemed to be a poorly made pornographic film, filled with extremely vulgar and offensive language and graphic sexual descriptions.  The hosts reacted with laughter and repeatedly quoted outrageous lines.  This was followed by a critique of Jim Norton's first TV appearance, featuring clips of his stand-up routine.  Studio guests Rich Vos and Patrice O'Neal joined the hosts in mocking Norton's performance, using highly offensive and sexually degrading language.  Brett Michaels, promoting *Rock of Love*, was briefly present in studio. The segment concluded with a musical interlude of Brett Michaels' "Every Rose Has Its Thorns."

A later segment continued the merciless mockery of Jim Norton's stand-up performance and an interview with Jill Nicolini, with Patrice O'Neal still present.  Highly offensive and sexually degrading language was used throughout this extended critique.  The discussion included Norton's early career, influences, and self-described "quick fix junkie" mentality.  The show then shifted to a discussion of commercials for failed products (Polar Vision, Apple Lisa, Arch Deluxe, Betamax, New Coke, IBM PC Jr., and the Edsel), with vulgar commentary and personal anecdotes. Two news stories followed, one about a woman locked in a closet and another about a woman who spent nearly two years on a toilet, both prompting graphic descriptions and offensive jokes from the hosts. Robert Kelly provided brief interludes throughout.

The final segment began with a crude joke about a woman stuck in a toilet.  This transitioned into a discussion of cringeworthy Microsoft promotional videos (one for the 386 processor and another for Vista's service pack), along with a similarly awful Wendy's employee training video.  The hosts played audio clips and discussed Bill Gates' past underestimation of computer memory needs; caller Keith referenced Gates' 640 KB quote.  A Mac consultant, Jim, called in and engaged in sexually suggestive banter with Opie.  A former Wendy's employee, Mike, also called in to share negative memories of the training video. The segment concluded with a news report about Haitians eating dirt cookies due to food scarcity, leading to discussion about food waste in America and concluding thoughts on the absurdity of the segments presented.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to fame?  Should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to fame? 
[00:00:30]  Should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to fame?  Should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to fame? 
[00:01:00]  Should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to fame?  Should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to fame?  Should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to fame?  Be forgot and never brought to my heart.  All the plaintiffs be forgot in days of all that night. 
[00:01:30]  But all the plaintiffs be forgot and never brought to my heart.  Shut up, all the plaintiffs be forgot and never brought to my heart.  Oh my God.  What's going on? 
[00:02:00]  It's the worst of Obi and Anthony.  It's stupid.  Something ridiculously loud and obnoxious.  Sound like the best of Dallas Sims World Records.  We're never going to make everybody happy.  So why do we have to now make more people not happy?  Oh no.  It's stupid.  It's audio drama.  If I may use the word duty.  It's the worst of Obi and Anthony. 
[00:02:30]  We've got to get right back into the radio show.  It's Obi and Anthony.  And very excited.  We wish he was in studio, but we'll take a phone or any time from Ricky Gervais.  Ricky.  Hello.  How are you, sir? 
[00:03:00]  Hey.  How's it going?  Good.  How are you?  Very good.  I hear you're having a bit of a heat wave in New York, aren't you?  Yes.  It's disgusting.  It's like 125 today.  That's ridiculous.  Where are you?  I'm back in London.  Okay.  Is it hot there?  It's nice.  It's like, you know, 75.  So I'm...  And I don't...  I mean, I sweat because I'm a fat bloke.  But even I'm not sweating.  So it's just right.  Are you one of these guys that believe in global warming or you don't believe? 
[00:03:30]  In all honesty, from what I've heard, it's definitely going to happen, but I'm going  to be dead.  Yeah.  So who cares, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Do you know what I mean?  I mean, that was their mistake.  Keep saying it's not you, but it's your children and your children's children.  So fine.  I mean, they really...  They also shouldn't have called it global warming because, you know, we're quite excited  in Europe about that.  But...  Yeah.  Yeah, because it's pretty gloomy and cloudy and rainy.  You would like a little more sunshine over there. 
[00:04:00]  They really have played the whole thing terribly, terribly badly.  So, yeah, not my fault.  It's disgusting.  It's like this morning, I leave my apartment at 5.40 to get here and it's already daylight  and it's just muggy and thick.  And it's like you understand why violence really goes up when it gets to be hot because  you just want to attack somebody physically.  Well, Sal, be careful.  Remember what happened with the tramp?  What was the tramp?  The hobo, as you call him.  Hobo. 
[00:04:30]  What happened with the hobo?  Wow.  Didn't you get in trouble for a hobo saying things about the queen and Condoleezza Rice?  Yes.  Oh, God, yeah.  A hobo.  Almost Charlie.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Almost Charlie ruled.  Yeah.  I just want to attack...  He really did.  He was hilarious.  It's too bad that we got in trouble for what a homeless guy was ranting about.  Yes.  I thought Ricky was talking about gay guys and had a cold.  Yeah.  Hey, our buddy Roland has already seen Ghost Town, right, Roland? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And he says he loved the movie.  Oh, that's great.  And it's not even coming out for what, another few months?  I think, obviously, you get it first.  You are the United States.  You are the world.  Yes, we are.  As Michael Jackson sang, yeah, exactly.  You are the world.  You're the bit that matters.  You get there on 19th September, and let old England get it on the 24th of October.  Wow.  And then Europe and... 
[00:05:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Why is that?  I mean, I understand for maybe movies starring American actors, but you're huge all over  the world, obviously, but you're from over there, so you'd think they would release the  movie for you guys first.  Well, I think it's a good idea for it, because it's an American movie.  It's set in New York.  It'd be nice to come home being a conquering hero, as opposed to come out in England, and  people think it wasn't good enough to be released in America.  Yeah.  That's our attitude in England. 
[00:06:00]  We're really suspicious.  I think we invented the phrase, familiarity breeds contempt.  Do you know what I mean?  So there's nothing exotic about it.  So I've got to come to England with it going, it was huge in America, honestly.  Believe me.  And I will be, in case you're asking, a lot of people have asked me, are you playing  an American?  No, I'll be doing the same accent as I did in the office extras and every other cameo  I've done.  I will be using my own accent and the same haircut.  But if I played Genghis Khan, he'd talk like this, he'd have this accent. 
[00:06:30]  I'd be this color.  I'm not getting there two hours early for makeup.  It's ridiculous.  It's not worth it.  It's just a film.  It's not worth killing yourself over.  So, yeah, I'll be doing my usual...  Ricky, that's the beauty of you.  You've got to watch your project for about 10 or 15 minutes to see what role you are playing  because your look doesn't change.  Like Robin Williams, he does the beard.  Okay.  Serious Robin Williams.  See?  He knows how to mix it up a little bit with the look. 
[00:07:00]  Never mind all that Daniel Day-Lewis nonsense.  Yeah.  Ooh, look, I've got a funny eye or I've got one left foot.  Big deal.  Hey, Ricky, as we're talking to you, I just got a text from my friend, Robert Kelly.  We're sure you know who he is.  He played a ghost in Ghost Town who basically silently followed you for three days on the set  like as a ghost.  Do you remember kind of a big, fat ghost who would try to strike up conversations with you awkwardly?  I don't know. 
[00:07:30]  Yes.  Yeah, but it wasn't awkwardly.  It wasn't awkwardly.  You're being polite.  You don't remember him.  You don't remember him.  Please, please.  See, we're hoping that you would say you don't remember him because it would give us some great fodder for the next 10 years.  I think I do.  And, of course, I've seen his picture and his name since because I check IMDb every day.  Yeah.  To see how many hits I got.  It's poor.  It's poor.  So if you could make people go and see Ghost Town.  You know, joking aside, I think Ghost Town's a really nice film and I hope people go and see it. 
[00:08:00]  I mean, there's no, you know, it hasn't got Tom Cruise in it or any of those.  But it's a really lovely film.  I think David Kemp did a great job and it's really funny.  And there's somewhat old-fashioned about it.  It's sort of like one of those, I don't know, it's a wonderful life type films.  It's funny as well.  I mean, there's lots of ad-libbing and it's a really funny film.  But it's a grown-up film as well.  Well, Ricky, we're going to do you the biggest favor because we love you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you.  We have Roland in studio.  He saw the film.  Yeah.  So he's going to tell everyone what he liked about Ghost Town.  This is a treat, Ricky.  This is a treat.  We don't do this often.  Roland.  It's like my own personal review.  Brilliant.  Yeah, go ahead.  Roland.  Ghost Town.  Well, Ghost Town stars Ricky Gervais, Greg Kinnear, and Tay Leone.  Ricky Haller.  Ricky Gervais.  Gervais.  Would you stop the S and get silent?  Don't heckle.  Listen, I'm assuming this is going to be a great review. 
[00:09:00]  This is going to be an amazing review.  It will be.  It would be a really screwed-up program if you got me on to say he was poor.  He did his usual one-trick pony.  No.  No.  The hair hadn't changed.  No, no, no.  You're great.  He looked short and fat, and it really showed up all in.  Roland.  I'm assuming this is going to be a great review, so don't heckle it.  Yes.  We got a guy that saw the movie already.  It doesn't get any better than this.  Go ahead.  Yes, sorry.  Sell Ghost Town for Ricky Gervais there, Roland.  It's sort of a romantic comedy, but it's like literally, to me, right now, it's my favorite  movie of the year.  Seriously.  It's funny. 
[00:09:30]  It has the romantic comedy elements, but it's like a classic movie.  It's like a classic romantic comedy where you're like, finally.  It's a great movie.  I loved it.  I love that.  That's brilliant.  That's one of the nicest things anyone's ever said.  Wow.  It has a good twist, though, with the different things, with the ghosts and everything, and  it's a really good story, and it had a great ending, too.  Oh, what's the ending?  I'm not saying.  I will not say, because I love the movie so much, I want everybody to go see it.  It's one of the best movies out there.  Did you see, Roland, I actually got a, I apologize, a construction worker Bob Kelly 
[00:10:00]  played, and Bob, as stupid as he is, Ricky, we know nobody but idiots, it was a pleaser  working with him.  And that's what I just got texted.  A pleaser.  A pleaser, yes.  Robert Kelly said it was a pleaser working with you there, Ricky.  That's great, and it was a pleasure working with him.  He has no idea.  Well, listen, I know it was a pleasure working with him, because it was a pleasure working  with everyone.  Ah, see?  Ricky's a nice guy.  Yeah, of course he is.  Diplomatic, aren't you?  Well, Greg Kinnear's a good actor.  I like Greg Kinnear. 
[00:10:30]  He's in everything, man.  Yeah, he really is.  He's really good.  Yeah.  Ricky, of course you're calling, because we're all excited here in New York, and I guess  Los Angeles as well.  We should promote that.  We're heard in L.A.  You're doing your stand-up.  Yeah, I'm doing a few dates.  I start off with a couple of warm-up dates, and in Madison Square Garden, the support  act is Louis C.K., who I think is, at the risk of putting myself down, the best stand-up  in America. 
[00:11:00]  I think he's amazing.  Well, he'd certainly take issue with that, but Louis is a great comic.  How is he as an actor?  Do you know what?  He said he was nervous about it, and he thought, how am I going to be another comedian on  a film goofing about?  Yeah.  But I really think he's going to be the surprise breakout star of this film, because he's  so charismatic.  He didn't just go in there and try and be himself.  He even shaved off his goatee.  He plays a really dim sort of lunk of a guy who's sort of like out of control. 
[00:11:30]  He's the only person in the film who's a bigger loser than me.  You do real...  Oh, go ahead.  Sorry.  He's absolutely great.  Well, you know, he's really charismatic and sweet.  And he's got a lot of heart.  And it's a very, very funny...  I mean, I think he's brilliant.  I can't get enough of Louis.  I just did...  I mean, I blog about him all the time.  I just put a video on my blog of Louis.  I took him on the private jet.  They gave us a private jet we were filming, right, in Lowell.  But I went to New York weekend, and I took Louis on it. 
[00:12:00]  On the way there, he forgot his keys.  He forgot...  I mean, it's an absolute catastrophe.  He was late.  He'd lost his bag.  He left a thing in the airport.  I mean, he's 40 years old.  And on the way back, it was turbulent.  And he was so scared, right?  He was sweating.  He looked like a big ginger testicle.  Just dripping, right?  And because he was scared, he was shouting obscenities.  And it was one of the funniest... 
[00:12:30]  I was scared.  But you know when you're nervous, you think,  well, if I'm going to die, this is all right,  because there's a man who's more scared than me,  and he's going to die saying something like,  shove it up your ass.  And it's so funny.  The video's on RickyGervais.com.  And it's just pure fear that fuels these comments.  Yeah, I heard about that.  I heard the video's good.  We'll link it on ONAradio.com.  You do realize he's an awful human being, right?  What, Louie?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think he is.  I think he pretends to be.  See, he's protecting that from you,  because he does our radio show a lot, 
[00:13:00]  and he's just an awful human being.  Well, he comes out with some pretty out there stuff,  but I assume it's the name of exploratory comedy.  You know what Louie's great gift?  Louie, we love Louie.  He's one of the best storytellers.  Like, he's just one of those guys that is inherently interesting.  No matter what he's talking about,  he can make it funny and interesting,  and I can't do that.  I totally, what he does is,  if he goes to the shops for a pint of milk,  he'll come back with a really self-deprecating story 
[00:13:30]  that happened to him,  and it's the funniest anecdote you've heard.  Yeah.  And it happened funny.  He went to a, I think he went to a Celtics game  when he was there,  and he said they kept going to the crowd  and put in people on the jumbatron.  There was a bloke with green hair,  and they go,  whoa, I laugh.  And then there was like, you know,  some guy dressed up as a clown,  and they put him on the jumbatron,  and people go and laugh.  And he heard this crowd go, whoa,  and he looked up,  and it was him.  And he said that they just went,  whoa, like, look at that guy.  He didn't even mean to be that weird. 
[00:14:00]  And he just, and, uh...  How poor would we have?  Oh, dear.  You know what makes me happy, too, Ricky?  I'm reading this thing where it says,  uh, you were doing stand-up,  and, you know,  there's always one critic  that's going to be a complete douche,  and this one guy gave you a hard time,  so you were closing every set by saying,  I can't say it on this side of the show,  but, uh, calling the guy an ugly,  a little ugly, pug-faced C.  Wow, nice.  Yeah.  Well, do you know what? 
[00:14:30]  When I first started,  you know, I was worried about,  I really feared being famous,  because the British press, you know,  are quite onto it,  and they're very snipey and personal,  and they're, they're like,  they're jealous,  they all want to be celebrities themselves,  you know.  That's not all,  I mean, 5% of them, right?  And I feared them.  And then I thought,  well, hold on,  I've got as much a platform as them.  I'm not going to stay for it.  So if someone says no to me,  I'm going to absolutely destroy them.  And, um, and, uh,  and now I don't fear it anymore.  I've got, I've got a better platform than them, 
[00:15:00]  because, um, uh,  these people that, that, that criticize you,  and I'm not having a go at all critics,  but when it's someone who watches telly for a living,  and tells us where we went wrong,  I want to go,  hold on,  I made a program,  you wrote 200 words.  You know what I mean?  It, it's sort of like, it, um,  so now I do,  I do sort of fight back now.  And, and, and, and because of that,  it doesn't hurt me anymore.  I just think, oh, God,  they're, they're nothing.  You know, what,  what are they going to do to me?  Um, so it, you know, 
[00:15:30]  I make comedy and stuff for like-minded people.  I do it for people who might like it.  And, and I don't care about people that don't.  Did you hate the criticism?  Because, like, we all get criticized.  Did you think it was like,  I don't, I didn't know what he said,  but was it legitimate criticism,  or was he going out of his way  just to be a real tool?  Well, um, he didn't like the,  um, I sort of,  he didn't like the Bible.  He's a, he's a,  he's a religious man himself.  And I do a thing where I deconstruct the Bible.  I look at Genesis and stuff,  you know, in a comedic way.  I'm not, I'm not getting on a high horse. 
[00:16:00]  I'm not, you know,  I'm not preaching.  And, um, he said, uh,  he said, oh, deconstructing the Bible.  Oh, that's too easy.  And I thought, well, it shouldn't be.  If you believe all this stuff,  then you should be strong in your faith.  People who are strong in their faith  aren't worried about jokes,  about religion.  They're not worried about it.  And, um, I just think he, um,  I think he, he gave it away  that it was personal.  You know, that, that's all.  That's why.  That's a great point.  Uh, I, I,  E-Rock just wrote this,  and I'm so bummed I didn't see this.  On a recent Saturday Night Live, 
[00:16:30]  uh, hosted by Steve Carell,  Ricky did a bit about the origin of The Office.  It was, uh, a show from Japan.  They aired an over-the-top Japanese version  of The Office.  That sounds hilarious.  It was funny.  At the end, Ricky is sitting  in a director's chair laughing.  He said, that's funny because it's racist.  That was an ad-lib.  That wasn't, yeah, that was an ad-lib.  Brilliant.  Which is nice.  Can I see that on YouTube?  I would love,  I don't watch, uh, Saturday Night Live  as much as I used to,  so I'm kind of bummed I missed that.  I think it is on YouTube.  I think I even linked to it on my website. 
[00:17:00]  Are they as repulsive over there  about, like, race and stuff here?  Because, like, you do anything racial here,  and Americans are such sissies about race.  Uh, over there, I know there's, like,  tension with Muslims,  but is there as much racial, like,  tension over humor?  Um, uh, well, I don't know.  I mean, you know,  obviously it's everywhere,  but, you know, there's idiots everywhere.  I think that, um,  you guys are more open about everything.  I think that you, um,  you sort of, you know,  vive la difference more than we.  I think there's a fear here. 
[00:17:30]  It's still a big taboo to even, um,  uh, bring up issues of race  in, in comedy or whatever,  whereas, you know,  I think that your comedians, uh,  are much more liberate about, you know,  you know that there's a difference  between making jokes, um,  uh, about race and being racist.  Yeah.  And, um,  and I think that we're still  a little bit scared.  No, it's...  We're a little bit scared to offend,  even though what you might be doing,  um, you know,  it isn't racist.  It, it, it, you know,  it's, it's just talking about issues.  So I think that it's probably, um, 
[00:18:00]  it's slightly freer in America,  but, you know, I, uh,  politically I don't know  whether it's a bigger or,  or less a problem.  I, I don't,  I don't see a lot of racism.  I'm a, I must say,  I never, I never really have  growing up here,  but I don't know that, you know,  you go into the,  some backwaters of places  and it's like nothing's changed.  What's, what's frustrating to us,  uh, in radio,  they still don't get that message  that we're just trying to make jokes.  As soon as you say something  that's, uh, you know, outrageous,  they think you're being racist 
[00:18:30]  when you were,  when you were trying to be funny  to the point, uh,  the company we work for now,  we're not allowed to do  any Asian humor whatsoever.  What's, can't do the voice.  Can't go.  We can't even discuss it.  Yeah.  I can't even tell you  what we're not allowed to do  because they'll just dump out.  Well, I'm intrigued now.  I'm intrigued as to what Asian humor is,  but, um,  is it like Jewish humor?  Yes, it's like,  yeah, just the stereotypical Asian stuff  that, uh, you know,  you would see in any comedy club  and people would enjoy it and laugh.  What? 
[00:19:00]  Just like they would  if you're being stereotypical  about blacks and Puerto Ricans  and everybody else.  What Jackie Chan does,  the way Jackie Chan sells his films,  like that,  to do any of that,  is, uh,  we get dumped out of.  Yeah.  So what,  so you're,  so what you're saying is you're,  you know,  a bunch of white guys  that are angry  that you can't be racist.  Right.  Or have racist humor.  What's the world coming to  if a bunch of white guys  can't get together  and broadcast hate?  Of course,  we created this damn thing  that broadcast,  we,  we bring sunshine. 
[00:19:30]  The world,  the world's going to the dogs.  Well,  the SNL skit,  we would get fired for that.  Really?  Yeah.  If we did that skit  on our radio show,  we would get fired.  There was a show here in New York,  JV and Elvis,  they did an Asian,  uh,  bit and they were trying  to be funny  and they are no longer  heard on radio.  This is the point,  I think.  And that's the point  that people have got to get over.  It depends where  the comedy comes from.  Yes!  It can come from a good  or a bad place.  If it comes from a bad place,  it's disgusting 
[00:20:00]  and it's not funny  and people like that  won't survive in,  in our world.  But if it comes from  a good place,  then it's cool.  It's okay.  You can make jokes  about anything  as long as you can  justify it.  And I just think  the subject of race  is no scarier  than the subject  of carpets  or the subject of art.  It's what you do with it.  Do you have a pen?  I have a pen, yeah.  All right.  Write this number down.  It's the corporate lawyers.  You need to have a discussion  with them for us.  Let me sort it out for you.  Because it sounds so logical, 
[00:20:30]  but we've had that discussion.  It goes nowhere.  Anyway, moving on.  GTA 4.  A lot of people  ranting and raving  about what you did  for GTA 4.  Oh, that was great fun.  Yeah.  That was really,  really good fun.  Yeah.  They just got me in  and said,  do stuff.  Go crazy.  I went,  I'd love to do that.  And then it took me  about half an hour  to get into the tightest  lycra all in one suit.  I mean,  I look like something  from a man who fell to earth. 
[00:21:00]  It was ridiculous.  I haven't found it yet,  but they're saying  you did like six to eight  minutes of stand-up  that you could watch  on the TV in the apartment.  That's right.  I think I did a radio show.  I did some stand-up  in a club  that you can go into the club  and see me do it.  And then I'm on the TV  as well.  Yeah.  And someone said,  oh, they got to my bit.  I met someone  and I said,  oh, I got to your bit.  I said,  can you shoot me?  And he went,  oh, I haven't tried.  Which will be the first thing  all my friends  and everyone else  in England do. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  The first thing they do  when they get to that bit,  they'll say,  I wonder if I can shoot him  in his fat face.  Although,  the good thing about  Rockstar Games  is they made me a bit thinner,  so I thank them for that.  I look pretty butch.  Hey, The Office.  Jimmy turned me on  to The English Office.  We've talked about this  when you came in studio.  Probably my favorite sitcom  of all time.  Wow.  And it gets better  the more you watch it  and how brilliant  that thing is.  And I'm so bummed out  it was only on,  what, two?  Twelve episodes.  Twelve plus three episodes.  I know. 
[00:22:00]  Well, there's sort of  a reason for that.  I'm lazy.  No.  No, because we sort of  did everything ourselves  and it's when you sort of  write and write  direct it and you're in it.  It takes a year  to do six.  And we didn't want  to farm it out.  We didn't want to  use other writers  or other producers.  And, you know,  even though we stopped,  we said everything  we had to say,  it still sort of lives on.  I mean, The Office,  the American Office  is on 100 episodes.  It's shown in like, 
[00:22:30]  it's still shown  in its original form  in all over the world  and there's loads of remakes.  So we sort of did our bit  and that's it really.  And I don't want to do something  just because it's working.  I don't want to milk it  because you do want  to do other things,  you know.  But I am,  and I'm very proud  of it as well.  Why haven't you been  on The American Office?  Are you open to the possibility  of maybe doing a cameo  or some kind of flip?  I think all of a sudden  they do some kind of flip  and there you are  would be just so much fun 
[00:23:00]  for everybody  that are fans  of The English Office.  Well, I wanted them  to be watching extras  in one episode  and I wanted Steve Corral  to come in and go,  no, I don't like this guy.  If they did an American remake,  I'd be perfect for this.  You know,  we've interviewed  a lot of celebrities  and you mentioned extras.  My most embarrassing moment ever,  and I've been doing this radio  for a long time,  Ricky Gervais comes in  to promote extras.  Oh, God, that's right.  And the whole time  I'm thinking that  it's The Office extras. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, like outtakes.  Outtakes and stuff  from The English Office.  Oh, I see.  And if you listen  to the Ricky Gervais interview  we did in studio,  it's so obvious.  I don't even know  about this show extras.  I'm thinking it's extras  from The Office.  I got so uncomfortable.  I could finally talk about it.  My hair was standing up  on my arms and stuff.  I just wanted to disappear  when you finally politely said 
[00:24:00]  it's a show on HBO.  You couldn't have been nicer.  You should have really  just slammed me.  Isn't embarrassment  a wonderful thing?  And then I ended up  watching it  and God,  another great show  by Ricky Gervais.  Thank you very much.  Again,  and another 12 episodes  in a special.  I know.  You're lazy,  I'm thinking.  I think so.  I know.  Yeah,  I get bored very quickly.  And I don't know.  I think it's because  I've been let down myself.  There's so many shows 
[00:24:30]  that just go on  for too long.  and it smacks of success  as opposed to trying  to achieve something  aesthetically.  And I do it  because I enjoy  the process really,  the creative process.  And that's the fun  for me.  But you can't deny though  that sometimes  a show goes on  like when you get  a happy days  and then it morphs  into a Joanie  loves Chachi.  I mean,  it's just more 
[00:25:00]  entertainment  for your buck.  I was thinking  about happy days  as I do.  I'd liked it early  and obviously  it gave us the term  Jumping the Shark  and everyone knows that.  But it was actually  towards the end  one of the strangest shows  ever to be made.  I mean,  it was genuinely  I mean,  interesting.  I mean,  I think it's  nearly as strange  as Different Strokes. 
[00:25:30]  But we can't talk  about that  because there was  people of different  colours.  That's right.  We're not allowed  to mention that.  Hey,  do you remember  Dudley was almost put in the  remember Dudley  was in the bathtub?  That was my favourite episode.  When Creepy Mr. Carlson  from WKRP in Cincinnati  was trying to photograph  sexy little Dudley  in the tub.  Yes.  That was the  very special episode  that's on YouTube.  That weird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh,  that's incredible.  That is one of the  weirdest shows ever.  Yeah.  They started doing  a lot of very special  episodes in the 80s.  That was a huge  thing to do. 
[00:26:00]  And it would,  you know,  tackle some of the  tough issues of the day  like child molestation  and drug use.  It's incredible.  Why don't we do it again?  Right?  But just with us.  We're just all white  living in the same house  and we just,  there's no issues at all.  Yeah,  we're happy,  successful.  Yeah,  that's all.  Wait,  what were you saying  about,  what was the weird,  happy days?  How did happy days  get weird for you?  Oh,  I saw one  when, 
[00:26:30]  you know,  James Randi,  the sort of cynic  and he's a guy  who says,  he's put up a million dollars  for anyone  who can prove  anything that's supernatural.  Wow.  And he's also,  you know,  a respected magician.  Yeah.  And he was in one episode  and he was,  you know,  the great,  the great Randy  and he had to get  into a tub of water  and it was a big show  and he escapes.  He does an escapology  thing,  right?  But they went, 
[00:27:00]  oh,  can I have a drink of water?  And someone goes,  here's a drink of water.  And he drank it  and he went,  that's neat vodka,  which is weird.  I don't know  where they got that from.  And he goes,  I'm allergic to alcohol  and he went unconscious.  And Fonzie goes,  I'll do it.  And he got into the bar  and escaped  without any training  and they were cheering  and he came out all wet  and I was thinking,  it's one of the strangest things  I've ever seen.  Yeah.  The hell?  I prefer this homoerotic relationship  with Ralph Malf and Potsy.  Like that,  just that kind of  fruity domination.  I thought he flirted 
[00:27:30]  with Mrs. C as well.  Yes!  Yes.  He definitely did  and the poor old guy  didn't know what was going on.  Yeah.  The thing about me  with the Fonz  is that he was clearly  42 years old  and hanging around  with school children  and he used to say,  would you please  come in the toilet?  He asked you to  come in the toilet.  Yeah.  Which,  again,  you know,  was a bit weird.  You want to go,  Mr. Fonzarelli,  you're really too old  to be hanging around  a school now.  I know you've got  a motorbike,  but no, 
[00:28:00]  you've got to stop  hanging around this school.  And he never,  everyone was scared of him,  but he never punched anybody.  You never saw him fight.  No,  he didn't need to.  No.  That's cool.  Fighting's not cool,  sucker.  Oh,  I've gone into the A-Team now.  Let's talk about the A-Team.  Now,  there's a show.  That's great,  too,  because no one ever  got killed in that.  They were firing off  all kinds of weapons,  but the bad guy  always crawled out  of the rolled-over jeep  or the shot-up truck.  You notice that  when there was an explosion, 
[00:28:30]  you could see the actor  come off a trampoline  Yeah.  and land on his back.  It was great.  It was just like  the perfect,  the flipping midair  and land on his back.  Not one of them  landed on a spike  in the ground.  Don't be sure.  I almost said this  to Ricky Gervais,  and now I have to say it  because I think  he would appreciate it.  Hey, Ricky,  it was rumored  that you were up  for the roll 
[00:29:00]  that went to Jack Gyllenhaal  in Brokeback Mountain.  Jake Gyllenhaal.  Jake Gyllenhaal  in Brokeback Mountain.  See,  that's the one sheet  for Mark Wahlberg  who's coming up next.  Oh.  I almost had another  bad moment  with Ricky Gervais.  I flipped the page over  thinking it's just another  sheet of bullet points  that we could go to.  It would have been  a different film,  wouldn't it?  Yeah.  It would have been.  But how was it, 
[00:29:30]  seriously,  how was it being  in Boogie Nights?  It was...  Hey,  when these shows  sell out,  you will still come in  and say hi to us,  right?  Yeah,  and are you going  to come along  to the show?  Definitely.  Oh my God,  yeah.  Brilliant.  Well,  I'll lay on  some canapes  and a glass of champagne  for you.  I know we have...  Actually,  what time do you go to bed?  I won't be off  until about 10.  You'll probably have to  leave halfway through,  won't you?  No,  I'll make it a late night  for you,  Ricky.  Every once in a while,  I'll stay here.  I always ask this 
[00:30:00]  to breakfast DJs,  what time do you go to bed?  Honestly,  I go to bed  around 9.30.  I just need my sleep.  I can't do it.  Every once in a while,  I'll push it to 11.  When I was filming,  I was just doing the film,  I go to bed at 9 o'clock  every night  because you run around  for like 10 hours.  I'm like a toddler.  I just need sleep.  I agree,  yeah.  Hey,  we do have to take a break,  but really fast,  where are you at  with your podcast?  Because you get  rave reviews on those.  We've just done  one special one-off  to launch a little, 
[00:30:30]  it's a bit of,  I shouldn't mention it,  it's an internet radio station.  Yeah.  Is that okay to mention?  Yes,  yes,  yes.  You know,  the NME,  the New Musical Express,  it's like a new music paper.  They just launched a radio show  and then we did a one-off  two-hour show  with music  that's being played,  you know,  just go,  if you go to  rickiegerace.com,  there's a link to it there  at the NME radio,  yeah.  And are you going to do it  on a regular basis again?  Well,  we might do sort of like 
[00:31:00]  another series of six,  but because I want it  to be regular,  I don't want to let people down,  so it's hard to find  that six-week period  where I'm not popping  back and forth.  It's the same as having a cat,  you know,  you can't just,  I need someone to look at it,  the analogy doesn't work at all,  it's nothing like having a cat,  I was just running out of words,  that's why I'm not going to do radio.  It's too bad though  because you hit  the Guinness Book of World Records  for most downloaded podcasts, 
[00:31:30]  wow,  eight million downloads,  eight million downloads.  Well,  it's gone up now,  it's actually,  it's 22 of the free ones  and about two million  of the paid podcasts,  so I think,  I think,  do you know what I think it is?  I think that it's actually  the growth of the iPod,  I think it keeps going up  because as people get an iPod,  they look for things  to download,  so it's still growing.  Isn't the iPod  just one of the best inventions  of the decade?  It's incredible.  I love it.  I'm not allowed to advertise, 
[00:32:00]  am I?  So I must have mentioned race,  podcasts,  or I've got into trouble again.  I won't mention  Condoleezza Rice and the Queen either.  Thank you.  You know what's funny,  when you come in,  we're going to go over songs  we work out to on our iPods  because I have such a weird size.  Oh, I bet.  Eclectic, Jim.  I bet you,  what do you,  okay,  I have got the Rocky soundtrack  on my iPod.  What is that?  That's pretty bad.  It's not that bad, though.  That's horrendous.  You could get a lot worse than that. 
[00:32:30]  How?  Well, I said,  well, yeah,  but if I tell you,  sometimes I work out to it.  That's,  well, you know what?  Growing up in high school,  my friend Frank  was a Sylvester Stallone fanatic.  He would take Polaroids  of the TV  when Rocky 3 was on  and he'd paste them  in his house,  his parents' house,  and he would work out  to the Rocky theme music as well.  Wow, that's great.  That's lovely.  Yeah, he was 13.  Yeah.  So it was kind of understandable.  Ricky, it's always a pleasure.  An absolute pleasure.  That was great,  and thank you so much  for giving me all those plugs. 
[00:33:00]  I'm only embarrassed,  but keep it up.  No, we think you're just amazing.  I was going to say terrific,  but amazing is the word.  Thank you, Ricky.  Thank you very much, guys,  and I'll see you next time.  Sounds great.  Thank you, sir.  Cheers, Mom.  See you.  Thank you, Jermaine.  So what becomes of you, my love  When they have finally stripped you off  The handbags and the glad racks  That yuck around 
[00:33:30]  Dad had to sweat  So you could buy  Hey, this is Ricky Dray's  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  And remember, there is no God  It's the worst  It's the worst  It's the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Hey guys, Opie from Opie and Anthony

[00:37:30]  How's everyone today?  Very good.  Lots going on around here, huh?  Ron and Fez just wrapped up their fine radio program, and now we're setting up some stuff for our fine radio program.  You know, I think they were intoxicated when they walked down the hall leaving their program.  Ron and Fez?  I think they were a little tipsy.  Hmm.  Look at that.  All right, so.  What a show we have today. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Is John Valby here yet?  There's one of John Valby's right-hand men.  Yeah, pull him in here.  Where's Mr. Valby?  Is he taking a snooze?  John is taking a little nappy-do, as he likes to call it.  Yeah, he sleeps before the show.  Yeah.  He's doing a nappy-do where?  Yeah, we did.  Downstairs in the nice car you guys sent him.  So Valby's out cold outside the studio?  Yeah, we had a couple earlier, you know, with lunch, as he does.  And, yeah, he's just taking a little nap.  But we're going down to try to wake him up.  Hey, you want to wake up Valby like you did last time? 
[00:38:30]  That's always fun.  Yeah, you get on the phone.  Or should we get the listeners to do it?  No, they'll be cruel.  Well, last time it was snowing on your head.  That's true.  You want to go out there and wake up Valby?  Does he need any more beer?  Yeah, beer's always welcome for John.  Yeah?  He loves his beer.  All right, get him a beer and give us a call, all right?  We're getting ready for musical dildo chairs.  Musical dildo chairs.  It's going to be great.  We're waiting for, like, the whole Ron and Fez show to clear out outside the studio.  Then we've got to set up our stuff.  Yeah.  Do we have enough chairs? 
[00:39:00]  Do we have enough apparatuses?  I think so.  Apparatus?  Apparatus.  Apparatus.  And apparati.  Apparati?  What was that other word we were looking for?  There was apparatus, appliance, and dildo.  Dildo.  The dildo.  It was all work.  Yeah.  So we're going to play musical dildo chairs.  Now, the apparati was supposed to arrive at 2.30.  Oh.  Let's find out.  And the ladies are supposed to start arriving. 
[00:39:30]  I'm getting nervous.  Yeah, let's find out what the deal is.  I want to make sure this is going down today.  A lot of people counting on today's show for...  Down.  For entertainment purposes.  Right.  Hold on a second.  Anthony.  Oh, no.  Yes.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  I just told him to get out of the car because I've got to send the guy on his way.  And I've got another car coming back at 5.  You're kicking John Valby out of his car?  He's taking a nappy do.  He wasn't sleeping.  He was sitting up.  That's how he sleeps.  He was in the middle of his nappy do. 
[00:40:00]  You can't interrupt the great John Valby when he's doing his nappy do.  No.  Nappy do.  You told him to get out of the car because you need it?  Yes.  Who is so important that you have to send the car?  Other limo companies have more than one limo, Anthony.  It's not a limo.  I sent them to a town car.  Oh, last time's a limo.  This time's a town car.  He gets the bus next time, right?  He gets the bus.  He's working down to the bus.  Sorry.  All right.  Thank you.  You got it, guys.  All right.  I guess John Valby will be in studio very soon then. 
[00:40:30]  He's done with his nappy do.  Nappy do.  Do we have dildos?  We need dildos.  Oh, my God.  No, they're going to be here any minute, I'm told.  Oh, my God.  You just hesitated.  They were supposed to be here 45 minutes ago.  Because our quote-unquote supplier called up and said she was running late.  Running late, but going to be here any minute.  Well, if the mayor didn't shut down all the sex shops in Times Square, we'd be able to  just run out and get them ourselves.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Any girls show up yet?  Oh, yeah.  We got four girls already filling out the paperwork.  Four girls is all we need.  Four girls.  We want more to show up, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  All of you who want to show up, show up for this.  That's right.  Yeah.  Plus, what do you call it?  Also, they have the opportunity, the girls that are in the contest, to jump into the ass contest.  Yeah.  Ass contest still going on.  Cross promotion.  Yeah.  Are we extending the ass contest, Ant?  Yes.  Extending the ass contest.  You know, the first day, actually two days, were a little slow.  But now it's picking up. 
[00:41:30]  Jeff, what's going on?  Yo, man.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, what kind of music are you guys going to play with the musical chairs there?  Jeff, haven't you figured it out yet?  Well, how about some Geddy Lee or something, huh?  A little bit of Rush.  Rush.  We got John Valby.  John Valby's here.  He's the perfect guy for this, Kyle.  It's going to be party-sounding.  A little bit of Geddy Lee in the background.  All right.  All dirty.  All dirty on there.  All right.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Bye.  I've got to hang up on him, because look who's outside the studio, man.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Just tell him.  We just want him to say hi. 
[00:42:00]  He's picking up his clothes.  The great John Valby.  Hey, there he is.  Look at you.  How you been?  Good.  Real good.  How about you?  You got your laundry with you.  Well, yeah.  They kicked me out.  Is that really true?  Our limo guy kicked you out of the town car?  Yeah.  They had to go pick up somebody else, you know?  Oh, man.  But you were in the middle of your nappy-doo.  I was.  I didn't even get my first Budweiser yet.  So I picked that.  Oh, look at this.  Anthony from Vital is banned now.  So you know what we're doing today, John? 
[00:42:30]  I heard rumors of it.  Last night in Jersey, they were telling me something about they were going to be sitting on...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Musical dildo chairs, it's called.  We're just calling it musical dildo chairs.  It works like musical chairs.  When the music stops, there's one less chair than there are girls going around, and they  must sit down in the chairs.  Are we going to be able to see this as we do this?  Oh, yeah.  We're going to have people like yourself judging to make sure they sit down properly.  Properly, let's just say.  Let's just put it that way, okay?  They have to sit properly.  And I can suggest a little wiggle as you go down. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  Give me a little chubby.  That'd help the judges.  We're all going to be able to watch and judge and make sure they are sitting properly  in their seats.  And, John, you've got a gig.  Where are you playing tonight?  Governors in Medford.  Medford.  Way out on the island.  Oh, that's out there, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to be fun, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Love the shows.  Hey.  Go there a lot.  Been a fan for years.  All right.  Remember the old Tooie's days?  Oh, East Setauka.  And Mad Hatter, Stony Brook, all those places. 
[00:43:30]  I went the last time I was in town, Levittown Governors.  It was, that was the night with the donuts in the parking lot where you thought I got  arrested, remember?  Right.  I did.  You know, I thought you were down for the count there.  You saw me doing the donuts, right?  Actually, I didn't.  No?  I was facing the other way in the truck.  Yeah.  And then I saw people running out of the place and saying, oh, he's going to get arrested.  You know, they were freaking out.  Yeah.  It was, yeah.  So John calls me the next day, dude, you didn't get arrested, did you? 
[00:44:00]  Like, no, thank God.  That was with that Lexus.  You turn in your Lexus in?  I'm supposed to turn it in today.  I haven't given it back.  I haven't given it back.  They got to come and get it.  I'm not going to turn it in.  Why am I turning it in?  See, they got to think that's good advertising for the Lexus that you refuse to give it back.  Right.  You like it that much?  I am not giving back the Lexus.  How funny.  Possession is nine-tenths.  How funny would it be that they have to repo it?  They have to repo it.  I'm going to start hiding it.  I'll tell Jamaican Mike, just stash it somewhere in the garage and tell him no. 
[00:44:30]  He came in his truck.  There you go.  I don't know him that.  Bill, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  What are the size of these dildos?  Bill.  Yes, sir.  I got to explain this to you and everyone else.  Listen closely, everyone.  We almost weren't allowed to do today's show, so you had to be listening very closely the  last couple of days.  We're going to have to keep it a little vaguer today. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  I'm going to hang up and go listen to myself.  But just use your imagination.  It's what we told you guys the last couple of days.  Right.  It's musical, toldo chairs.  You know what's going on.  Figure it out.  What are you picturing in your head?  Use your mind.  Right.  That's exactly what's going to happen.  There you go.  Very good.  Good job.  Visualizing.  It's a headrest, Opie.  That's what they're being used for.  Headrests.  Picture it in your hat.  Yeah.  John, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  John Valby, big fan. 
[00:45:30]  Saw you in 1982 in Connecticut.  Long time ago.  Hey, listen.  Got a question for you.  Last time he was on, you promised him naked chicks on the couch.  Oh, we did promise you something on the lesbian couch, John.  I think with the...  That's difficult.  I want John's in the studio.  I think with the turnout we are going to get today with the girls, I'd be amazed if something  doesn't happen on the couch.  John, we should pace ourselves.  What time do you have to get out of here?  Because we want to do the musical dildo chairs, and we want to make sure we get some lesbian  couch stuff for you today.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Okay.  Why don't we take a break, Anthony? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  And we'll get the festivities going, okay?  Absolutely.  All right.  It's the Musical Dildos Competition.  Musical dildo chairs to come.  Is there any kind of jelly around?  That's all I'm saying.  Jelly?  You need some jelly.  Is there anything like that laying around here?  We have some jelly.  All right.  Just making sure a lot of people are asking questions for some reason.  And if we have jelly, I don't understand that.  Why?  I guess we got grape.  Why? 
[00:46:30]  Are you hungry?  You need a...  Yeah.  People are asking.  I was just wondering.  And the answer is yes.  I guess we do.  So you don't need a P&J or anything?  No.  That's fine.  You sure?  Fine.  I'm good.  By the way, so far, three girls have showed up for the musical dildo chair game.  Uh-huh.  We're getting some ladies calling, saying they want to be a last-minute contestant.  Late entry.  Come on down.  If you get here within the hour, fine.  You're in.  Yeah.  All right.  And John Valby in the studio.  Hey.  A couple people just want to say hi real fast. 
[00:47:00]  Kyle, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  How you doing today?  Good.  I've been a fan of Valby's for many years, and I never knew his real name.  And until he was on your show the last time, I didn't know his name was John Valby.  I knew him as Dr. Dirty.  I wanted to know if he has a tape out.  Tape?  A CD.  Yeah.  Excuse me, a CD.  When I saw him at Levittown and Governors, one of his guys goes, hey, here's John's latest  stuff.  He dumped literally 30 CDs on my lap.  Did he really?  Oh, yeah.  You got so much stuff out. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, we got tons of stuff.  Tons of stuff.  All right.  Cool.  All right, bro.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  All right.  Anthony, as we wait for the girls, you want to hear some ditties from John Valby?  Of course.  Is that too loud?  I could, uh...  No, I can't hear myself too good, but you can hear me, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, yank my doodle, it's a dandy.  Yank my doodle till I die.  Make that wiener shoot some fireworks, just like the Fourth of July.  I've got a Yankee doodle boner. 
[00:48:00]  I've had it since you rubbed my thigh.  So yank my doodle, if you please.  That bulge is not a phony.  Just stick your fingers up my ass and stroke my macaroni.  Yank my doodle, it's so big.  Baby, it's a dandy.  Stick that sucker in your mouth, you'll swear it tastes like candy.  Yank my doodle, it's a dandy.  Yank my doodle till I die.  Lick my lizard till it's standing tall, right through my pubic hair. 
[00:48:30]  If you love Yankee doodle peckers, I've got one that I can spare.  So yank my doodle till it comes and point it toward your boobies.  They say the stuff is beauty cream.  Let's make your boobies pretty.  Yank my doodle, it's so big.  Baby, it's a dandy.  Jerk that turk and make it squirt and keep a Kleenex handy.  Yank my doodle, it's a dandy. 
[00:49:00]  Yank my doodle till I die.  All right.  John Bell.  A little warmer upper.  A little warmer upper.  I think they just burnt out the dump button.  I said boobs instead of the T-word.  Oh, wow.  Thanks for cleaning it up.  Jeez.  That must be it.  Yeah.  I don't think they had a problem with that.  I didn't use any of the bad words.  What happened?  What happened?  It's a yank and a doodle dandy. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  It's an all-American song.  How about, it's degradable when your mom finds out your girlfriend is inflatable.  It's deplorable.  But I find her plastic sphincter just adorable.  I admit it.  Though her beaver isn't furry like a kitten. 
[00:50:00]  You can imagine the word.  I can F her up the ass without her shitting.  Because, like her sister's boobs, you're just inflatable.  He says F in, but then he uses the X-word.  John, John.  Well, you know, I knew you were going to bleep one of them, you know.  Carefully says F in, and then says the X-word.  Oh, man.  How about, when I'm feeling blue, I whip out my magoo and rub its little head 
[00:50:30]  Till it gets big and red  I tickle the blue vein  That runs along the shaft  Until the head goes  And gives my thumb a bath  Wouldn't you agree?  My magoo and me  Have a handy kind of love  Yeah, yeah  Now that's fine.  Now, did that make it? 
[00:51:00]  I don't know.  I don't know, but it's fights and magoo.  What the hell's a magoo?  I don't know.  I don't know if that made it.  I would love to know what the result is there as far as dumps go  Because a magoo?  Wow, you know, I thought I had carefully, you know, picked through these  And used junk whenever I needed to  And boobs instead of the T-word  Well, you can.  You didn't use the word junk once yet  Stand up and cheer for girls who give head  Pulling back your limp junk right from the dead 
[00:51:30]  They've got knee pads on their slips  And plenty of chapstick for their lips  Some like the cornhole, some like the screw  But I like the ones who'll slurp out my goo  Spin or swallow, I don't care  As long as her head is there  At the end of the month  Most girls will agree  It's time for a little tonsil hockey  When your big balls slap her chin 
[00:52:00]  You'll know that you can't get much more in  So stand up and cheer for the girls in this bar  The ones who suck junk  They know who they are  Later on  When we're pumping goo  We'll know who they are too  Oh my God  Are we still on the air?  I see a couple of maybe dumps  Why are people running down the hall 
[00:52:30]  Panicking?  How many dumps that time?  Now it's amazing when you see one of those counters  Just drop to zero consistently  I don't understand  Is the thoughts you're censoring?  It's certainly not the worst  I know  I think you hit a couple bad notes  I think that's what that is  I don't understand  Too descriptive  Oh is that what they said?  Too descriptive  Too descriptive  Shit and balls  You could say balls  You just can't say what they're doing  Oh  Isn't that stupid?  Let me see  I was  I was out on a date 
[00:53:00]  In my daddy's car  I picked her up  In the New York bar  I finger effed her  Slit  She didn't let out a peep  I had my junk  In her throat  Too deep  I was humping her face  My junk started to spit  The doctor said  The bitch  Had an  Epileptic  Fit  Well where  Oh where  Can my  Pecker be? 
[00:53:30]  The bitch  Bit it  Right off  Of me  Here I stand  With two balls  And a stump  Please fat X  Be my pecker  When you take  Your next dump  Cha cha cha  Now that should have made it  Oh no  You know  You know John  You're just not learning  What's up?  Maybe the dump guy  Was sleeping on that one  Oh yeah?  Or maybe he just  Ran out of dump  Nice  Went through  Hey more girls

[00:55:30]  Keep playing them  I'm enjoying them  But once  Once we play it  On a Saturday  People are going to love it  You know  I got a new limerick  That I really like  And see if you like it  While eating  Can you say  While eating a girl  From Iraq?  Yeah  Because you could be  Just dining on her leg  Maybe you're  Into cannibalism  Right  While eating a girl  From Iraq  A buzz  Interrupted my snack  Now this is  Of course  Because you  Refused to enforce  The no fly zone  Just south of her crack 
[00:56:00]  The old man  Told your sister  It was pudding  He'll sing me  Another word  It's worth  I like that one  Well  I wonder if that one  Made it through  It was good up until the end  No that's fine  You think it made it?

Yeah  Woo!  So the game works, Opie  If you miss a seat twice  You are out  Correct, Anthony  You get one free pass  Yes  All right, I'm set  Okay, we're going to just do a practice round 
[02:21:30]  Every girl has a seat  Just to get a feel for the playing field, I guess  Now, when you're in your seat  No, we want you to, you know, rotate and stuff  Walk around  Yeah, walk around  When you're in your seat and sitting  And everything is where it's supposed to be  Somebody has to confirm that it is indeed where it's supposed to be  Okay, so don't move  Okay  Why don't we start the music?  There we go  Oh, they're walking around now  The music is going  And  Oh, they don't 
[02:22:00]  Oh, look, they're doing the old strategy  Where you kind of linger in front of an open seat  No, you must keep moving, girls  Here you go  Keep moving  What a great song this is  Oh, my God  It's like a day at Willowbrook  Oh, oh, oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Uh-oh  Now, um  Okay, I'm seeing a problem  How can we, how can we tell if they sat right? 
[02:22:30]  I have a question  Actually, away from that  I don't know about anyone else, but I can't see any part of the chair  All right  All right  All right  I'm glad we did this because we got to get the rules straight  Okay  Um  Girls, when you sit  Uh, the appliance has to be in a proper area 
[02:23:00]  If you know what I mean  Wait, which proper area are we talking about?  Well, I don't think you could just be sitting on the chair  I don't think you could just be sitting on any appliance that may be in the chair  I think you know what we're talking about here  Don't make me spell it out  Am I, am I correct?  Um, is she correct?  Yeah, by the way  I would say yes  Take a look around at all the girls 
[02:23:30]  Are you correct?  No  You are not correct  Are you correct?  And are you correct?  No  No one's correct  It looked like somebody opened the Ark of the Covenant over there  Okay, all right  All right, why don't we start the game, Anthony?  Ugh  Yeah  Easier idea  She's trying to talk  What?  Krista?  She's trying to talk  She's trying  She's trying  Why doesn't the appliance already be in place? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, oh  And then you just went and sit  Hey, if you want to play it that way  Hey  Can we just insert and walk?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  If you can hold it  All right, hold on, hold on  She asks the same goddamn question that she just asked the right way  You know what?  I think you best not talk so much  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry I'm drunk  Best not talk  That's okay  Hey, no, there's no problem with that  Give her some more food from Paisano's  Now, if you want to  If you girls want to  As you walk around the chair  Actually have certain things where they're supposed to be 
[02:24:30]  Before you sit  That's fine  Can we go somewhere to make certain things get there?  Yeah, go ahead  If you need to, why don't you hit the Jay Moore suite for a second  You can go into the bathroom and make sure everything is prepared properly to accept blah, blah, blah  Okay?  All right, we've got to get this contest rolling  Yeah, we really do  So why don't we  Ladies have literally like 30 seconds to get rid  Oh, God

[03:15:00]  In the dead of the night  Although we both lie close together  We feel miles parked inside  Was it something I said  Was it something I said  Or something I did  Did my worst not come out right  Though I tried not to hurt you  Though I tried  But I guess that's why they say  Every rose has its thorns 
[03:15:30]  Just like every cowboy  Sees a sad, sad song  Every rose has its thorns  Yeah it does  I listen to a fade song 
[03:16:00]  Playing on the radio  I hear that DJ says  Love's a game of easy come and easy go  But I wonder does he know  He has never felt like this  And I know  That you'd be right here right now 
[03:16:30]  If I could let you  Now somehow  I guess  Every rose has its thorns  Just like every night  Has its thorns  Just like every cowboy  Has a sad, sad song  Every rose has its thorns 
[03:17:00]  Though it's been a while now  I can still feel so much pain  Like a knife that cuts through  The wound heals  But the scar  The scar remains  I knew I could have saved the world that night 
[03:17:30]  If I can't know what to say  Instead of making love  We both lay on  In separate ways  But now I hear we found someone new 
[03:18:00]  And I never meant that much to you  To hear that tease me up inside  And to see it  Cut through the life of a knife  I guess  Every rose has its thorns  Just like every night 
[03:18:30]  Has its dawn  Just like every cowboy  Seizing the sad, sad song  Every rose has its thorns  Yeah  Hey, this is Bret Michaels of Poison  And you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony 
[03:19:00]  Opie and Anthony  Hey, it's Jim Norton  From the Opie and Anthony radio program  Welcoming all the new subscribers  Joining us after turning on their new  XM and Sirius radios  Hello  Describe the show a bit  It's shitty  Thanks for checking us out  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony  Right back at it 
[03:19:30]  Opie and Anthony  Rich Vos in studio  We got the whole gang pretty much coming in today  Rich  Bob Kelly's on his way in  Patrice O'Neill  Who just did TV here in New York City  He's coming in  And a little later on this morning  We're all going to take a look at  Jim Norton's first TV appearance  Can't wait  Oh, it's going to be ugly  Good  I mean, we took a beating, what, two weeks ago, Ant?  Yeah, when we played some of our old radio shows  From when we first got a radio show together  Yeah 
[03:20:00]  It was a tape that was 12 years old  And Jimmy's is about 10 or 11  So this is going to be a lot of fun later on  I think people are going to enjoy it more than you think  I don't think so  I can't wait to hear your little voice  Pray for me  Pray for me  Jimmy used to do a little character  Yeah  I was wonderful and high energy  It wasn't just Jimmy  Like, Jimmy comes out now and he's Jimmy  You know, he talks like Jimmy  He acts like Jimmy  But apparently, and I haven't heard this or seen this  He comes out as a little character 
[03:20:30]  Do you have the first line of it?  If you want to tease it  Do you have it in front of you or do you not have it?  Oh, go get it  Oh, I would love to just  Have the tease so people can hear it  I just want to hear your voice  What was the first place I met you?  New Brunswick?  It was North Brunswick  It was a gig we were doing together  That was canceled that night  And you were a douche  No  Yeah, no one likes you when they first meet you  He makes a worse, like, first impression than hepatitis  Voss, the first time I was getting 50 bucks  And me and you and Vinnie Brown were doing a gig  And the guy's like, look, I'll give you all 50 
[03:21:00]  But I can't pay you  And Voss goes, this is not a hobby, pal  But then he goes to me  You're the opener, you're only getting 50  High five, Rich  I hear you, bro  But then he says to me, you're only getting 50  You're lucky we're giving you that  I went, gee, thanks, guy with a ponytail  Yes, you did  No, I probably took a liking to me  This is a hobby, pal  I kind of loved him for it  Because Voss was so brutally honest  All right, listen  We got  Oh, we do have it  You want a little taste? 
[03:21:30]  I just want to hear a little bit  All right  Of Jimmy's little character that he used to be  All right, we got  It wasn't as bad as it was in 93  This was a couple years later  It was better  Yeah  I think you're going to be impressed with this, actually  All right, let's  All righty  Let's find out  Just a taste of what we're going to do later on  I love this stuff  In the show  Norton, what year is this?  96?  Two years ago  You want to say 81?  My first TV experience  96 is a long time ago  I taped it in Conan's studio  You had to look up at the audience 
[03:22:00]  It's the only time I've ever been in Conan's studio  Yeah  I'm not good enough to do a show, apparently  I'm sorry, I was there taping Friday  Well, you had to look up at the book  When you got the gig  I hate it when the Jew is on fire  All right, now go play some defense  You're doing very good  He's scaring me  Is this the new boss?  No  When do I ever fail?  You're like the LeBron James of radio right now, man  I was going to just trash Conan, but screw it 
[03:22:30]  He doesn't really care about this show whatsoever for some reason  Here's Norton on TV for the first time  Thank you  Thank you, how are you?  You're laughing at me  No, that's good, man  That's good  You're high energy  You got a little voice  And people will instantly look at you and pay attention  Because they'll want to see what type of assy douche that voice is coming out of 
[03:23:00]  Right after he went, how are you?  His bow tie spun around  Hi, how are you?  Know what I'm learning quickly  And we should tell the newbies out there that want to get into radio  Or to become a comedian like these guys  You got to get past the I'm excited to be here stage  And right to the bitter stage if you're ever going to make it  Right to the angry, I've been crapped on my whole career  We just played a tape of us a few weeks back  And we were just happy to be here 
[03:23:30]  Everything was like  Had to be so full of energy  And the ratings were just so-so  As soon as we were like F management, F this station, F this, F that  The bitterness  Through the roof  Ratings went through the roof  Any comic, and I say this on stage  They run to the stage, they stink  Because nobody runs to work in the morning  Is it that slow little jog, walk, run up to the stage?  Or if you see them on the side of the stage and they're shadowboxing  David, if you were in a hospital where they have heart surgery 
[03:24:00]  And you look up and the surgeon is shadowboxing  You're probably going to die  You don't want him  Here's Jimmy from about 10 or 11 years ago  On TV for the first time  Thank you  Thank you, how are you?  Good  I feel good, man, I'm in a great mood  I feel sexy, I feel sexy  Wasn't a joke, but thank you for laughing  You just laugh 
[03:24:30]  You fake laugh at your own joke  Jimmy's cringing  There's a lot of  I forgot about this  My name should be Jim from Munaki  There's a lot of fake laughing  Can you write that down?  Laugh  Right after the punchline, laugh  And then dot, dot, dot  Oh, is that  Oh, is that cringe-inducing  I'm joking, but thanks  Almost like we're all in this together, folks  Right  Just one of the guys like you 
[03:25:00]  Oh, Jesus  Did anybody let the air on you and suck it in their mouth  So they could talk high, too?  Too wordy  I know, it was too wordy  I knew it was coming  You really do sound like a pet for a wizard  Hang over a wizard show  You little flapping wings  Hey, what's going on?  What's going on over here?  What do you want to do, boss?  Oh, I hate you  I hate you  Bob, my girlfriend told me that when she was Christmas shopping for me 
[03:25:30]  She went into the cellar  And she made the error of him and stupid Keith Robinson  Who we should have had today  Asking him, what should I get him for Christmas?  And apparently that was an open door  To a lot of unpleasant suggestions  I laughed  She said the funniest thing was when Bob said  How about a turtle suit?  They gave me a beating  And it's going to happen now  Push the button  Hey, Swanson from New York 
[03:26:00]  You're on the show  Hey, Swanson  What's up?  Norton sounds like the pregnant lady from Fargo  Hi, how are you?  Back to the tape  I wanted to look sexy  Because it's my first TV taping  And there'd be some hot women here  And I wanted to look good  So I ran out and spent $15 on a haircut  That I could have gotten for free  In a mental institution  Horrifying, isn't it?  This is awful  I grew up with a military father  Which is why I got this  And I hated that  Because my father was a drunk 
[03:26:30]  And he was a very embarrassing man to be around  Because he would take me and my mother out  And introduce us to people  It was like, this is my wife  And this is my son  This is for fighting  This is for fun  Okay, okay, okay  Hit the button  I don't want to hear anymore  It's ruining my impression of Jimmy  I assumed you were always brilliant  That was a pretty good joke  The mental institution joke was a good joke 
[03:27:00]  But she laughed over it at the wrong time  I liked the mental institution joke  $15 on a haircut that I couldn't got for free  In a mental institution  That wasn't a bad opening  To follow it up with that little singy songy  I was like, this is my wife  And I grabbed my hog  This is for fighting  This is for fun  Oh, they should crank a box  And you should pop out of it  Which one was for fighting?  I didn't analyze it like that  I was just doing the full metal jacket scene  Yeah, but this is my wife  And this is my son 
[03:27:30]  This is for fighting  Oh, the wife  The wives are fighting  Yeah, I just grabbed the hog  But then what's the son for?  For fun  It became irrelevant  He rhymes  The son rhymes  So the son was there  I thought that meant there was a little  I thought it was a little father-son incest  No, no, no  It was nothing  Fun  I didn't know  They just pat you on the top of the head  And this is for fun  No, no  Did you want to go in the direction of song parodies  After that?  After that big  I mean, the applause and stuff  Did you think maybe, you know  I don't like the fact that you're asking this  But in not a very sincere way 
[03:28:00]  I think that you're asking this with song  No, because I mean  I remember when you used to do that bit  And sometimes you used to march on the stage  And do it  What?  Oh, yeah  He used to march  He used to get into character  And he would march across the stage  Like he was in the army  Right?  Of course  I didn't march  Let's go back to the tape  I'd tell you if I marched  I don't like you  Oh  Look at him finish laughing  Yeah, they were laughing  And he was scary  My father was very scary  Because he would have  He would have Vietnam flashbacks 
[03:28:30]  Which was horrifying  Because he was never there  All right  That's not bad  I remember one time  He threw me up against the wall  He said  Do you know what I went through  In 1967?  Canadian customs?  Take your time with that  Thank you for laughing  Those that didn't  You know  Did we fight Canada?  All right  All right  All right  It's so weird  That you do a parody  And then you're too hip  For the room  All in one  So your little giggle 
[03:29:00]  At the end  Of everything that's  Supposed to be funny  Why don't you just  Tickle them after  Every joke  And this whole thing  Is like really weird  You don't know  What I got  My father was  Why  Why'd you do that voice?  Why'd you go through  Because I made it  I was younger  I was high energy  Yeah  I get it  That's before he  Clogs his throat  With a bunch of stuff  You should be in a blimp  Bombing a TV station  Bob let's go  When's Fatso coming in? 
[03:29:30]  When's Patrice coming in?  I just did  This is Rich Voss  You might recognize me  If you were on the train today  You are listening to  The Worst of Opie and Anthony  You want another taste  Of Norton's first TV appearance?  Oh please  Oh y'all already started  Yeah  Well we just got a little taste of it  Why don't you catch Patrice up  Why don't you catch  There's only two lines  To catch him up  Yeah you gotta catch him up  No we can't  Come on  No we can't  And this is for fun  Huh? 
[03:30:00]  This is for fun  You're gonna let that  Get away from Patrice  I know Norton's Jersey  Hack origins  I know it  I already know  Well it's his first TV appearance  About 11 years ago  Let's go right back  It was Friday Night Videos  In 96  Yeah here we go  Was it Friday Night Videos?  Yeah at Conan's studio  They were doing them in New York  Yeah  There's an interview with it too  Let's get back to my head  The problem with it  Is it doesn't look good on me  My father looks great  He has a crew cut  The handsome sturdy  Military face  Women love my dad  That's where I screwed up 
[03:30:30]  You don't  I don't have a handsome sturdy  Military type of face  I have a little fat baby face  It sucks  I am not sexy  A little crew cut  A little fat baby face  I look like the bastard son  Of Sinead O'Connor  And Uncle Preston  Oh I love when you put  Two people together  As the bastard son of  I know  I don't  I don't have a handsome face  I don't have a handsome face  And after that set  You don't have a family  Or friends  That voice should come with  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  I could have changed that joke 
[03:31:00]  Now I should redo it  Sinead O'Connor and Bob Kelly  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha ha  Oh  My dad was a handsome face  I will emphasize this part of the joke  And they didn't like my dad  That was a lie  I was just trying to get to my  Did he drive you to this  Did he drive you to this set  And go  Are you going to talk about me  Or something  You did three jokes  On your father already  Keep talking  I know  You think I don't know  Nervous  I'll keep talking  Until something funny shows up 
[03:31:30]  Chatter  Idiot  Am I an audience member  After that set  You should be  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Oh  Oh  Oh  No you didn't  Oh no  They laughed  It wasn't even funny  You said  I have a baby face  Well I did  I knew  No but that's when you used to make  Facial expressions for your punch lines  Ha ha  Little Play-Doh face  Bastard son  And who else 
[03:32:00]  Uncle Fester  On crack  Ha ha ha  Ha ha ha  Thank you  Oh  Did you have your hand up  Oh and he threw the mic down too  That was the opening  Of the HBO special  Did they just go to silhouette  Ha ha ha  They did once for you  It was called an eclipse  Ha ha ha  Ha ha  I just  You know what the sucks about it  Is that there's just no way out of them  Right  I have to accept them  Cause they're always gonna be there  Oh they're just quick and easy 
[03:32:30]  Aren't they  Ha ha ha  Don't you undermine that  Like it's quick and easy  That was funny  That was very good  Come on Bobby  They're very good  That was the best thing to happen  To like  If Bobby just became  This little fat man  Ha ha ha  And it's always a quick  Cause he has funny fat shape  He's just completely round  Like a little basketball  And it's just  Went bald  Like it's just nothing  There is a god  Bobby  Bobby used to look like 
[03:33:00]  Like he should have  Cigarettes rolled up in his sleeve  And just like smoke  And blow smoke rings  And it just fell apart  You should have a yoo-hoo  And a ham rolled up in your sleeves  Now Bobby looks like  The last pick  Ha ha ha ha  It's like  A little  A little skinny girl  Or Bobby  All right  We'll take him  You used to look like  A movie star  Dude Bobby  First time I met Bobby  I looked like that  Now he looks like  A movie theater  Ha ha ha 
[03:33:30]  I'm surprised  You're not showing  Something on your back  Now he has trouble  Just moving  Ha ha ha  It's just amazing to me  That he's so much  Fatter than me  But here's the difference  I know  I know the difference  You're four foot seven  You look like  A scaffolding accident  He's supposed to be fat  Yeah  Patrice is supposed to be fat  You're not  That's the difference  Wait  It's just  Patrice is like big  You're like  Oh my god  Here he comes  You know what I mean  It's like you're very obvious  When you walk in the room  Get serious 
[03:34:00]  I get you  And punt  Exactly  All right  Let's go back to Norton  Let's go back to Norton's  First TV appearance  And then we can go back to talk about  How Voss just did a Larry Amaro story  Yeah  From 1983  Bobby looks like a Tempur-Pedic pillow  Ha ha ha ha  Perfect delivery too  Oh not too eager  Oh Jesus  Oh my god  You put your head on his back  We got it 
[03:34:30]  We got it  We got it  Very relaxed  He was very relaxed  With that delivery  Oh it was perfect delivery  Like his outfit  Where's he rolling  I'm making my head hurt  All right let's go  Here's Norton  First TV appearance  I look young too  Don't I  I hate that  I'm 27 years old  I look like a little boy  It's just  The last woman that took me to bed 
[03:35:00]  Tucked me in  Tucked me in  I know  Jesus  I just want to stay home  And watch films  You want to see good movies  Forget the stuff that's out now  Watch the stuff from like the 1940s  Best movies ever done  Why?  Because they couldn't curse on camera  They couldn't  So they had to show like their anger  And annoyance by overacting  They were great movies  Watch one of them  Every time they get aggravated  They wouldn't curse  They would just go  I bet that was a good face 
[03:35:30]  It's kind of funny though  That's in the 40s  It's the 1990s  That is still the best thing  To do in a bar  If a woman rejects you  It throws her right off track  Hey baby  Can I buy you a drink?  No  Hey baby  Can I buy you a drink?  Rats  Nice line  This isn't black and white  It had subtitles  Hey baby 
[03:36:00]  Can I buy you a drink?  We could squeeze a little more in  Before the break here  That's great watching you  Just spin out of control  Believe it or not  I have had a lot of practice  Dealing with rejection  No I have  You know why?  And don't pretend you didn't notice  You're a nice polite crowd  I have a tiny little chin  Don't I?  Look at this  I hate it  I have the profile of a frog  Absolutely  I had a commercial audition today  One line  Bud  I just hate you  At least she's doing topical humor  Genius 
[03:36:30]  They're laughing though  Norton  Norton would trash a comic  Sounding like that right now  Like  Yes  What do you think we're doing?  Praising it?  You know what?  But Norton has a fake  He's  He's really proud  Norton is very nostalgic about himself  He's really proud  Of this material  He knows we're going to trash him  So he has his hand  But he really is  He's listening  And enjoying this nonsense  Incorrect  Shut up  Don't say incorrect  I'll tell you why he's wrong 
[03:37:00]  Incorrect  We all have that  When you look back  It's really embarrassing  I couldn't watch it  It's embarrassing  It's really embarrassing  I'd love to watch it  You had so much confidence  You went from no chin  To a little chin  In your set  Like all  You don't have to leave  Just relax  I love how Voss  Takes the headphones off  Like I'm taking myself out  I'll tell you why  This is not as embarrassing  As it could be  Because years ago  We did my 93 tape  And that was humiliating  The 93 one  Where you rubbed your head  At least this one  I see where you're like  Alright man  You're changing  I know what this is 
[03:37:30]  It's developing  It's becoming what he is today  And we can't see him  That's  If we  Well we're going to put the video up  On onaradio.com  And all the websites  We need to see it too  Because this is just as bad  Norton  10 years ago  Is as bad  As a bad comic now  Like he's not as bad  Like I would see somebody  Like that  Saying this nonsense now  Like I look like the frog  And you know bud  There's guys that would still do that  Oh  Yeah  You know what I mean  Like this is  He stinks  Visual too 
[03:38:00]  We have to see how awful he is  We have to see you  And you're dumb  I was awful  On my interview  I hope they play the interview  Because that was really douchey  I was trying to be like  Very very  Oh I want to hear that  Oh we got the interview  I was trying to be charming  That's a little later  But let's get to the  You want it to be liked  So much  So much  Let's get back to that  Jersey bum  I just hate my head  I tried to grow a goatee  It slid off  It's not fair man  Even the elephant man 
[03:38:30]  Had a chin  Alright granted  It was on the back of his head  That was a little laugh  You guys are good  It's okay to laugh  He's not here  And I'm sorry  But when your head  Is that big and fat  You deserve to stand in a cage  While British children  Throw pebbles at you  British kids were great  They were ruthless  Look at him  He's got a big egg  Pow  Pow  I am not an animal  Yeah well  You're no Mel Gibson either  Pow  Well you're no Mel Gibson either 
[03:39:00]  Let me tell you  Couldn't just be regular children  It'd be English  Yeah no Mel Gibson either  This was a begging for some money sent  He was going to show all his arsenal  I was  He does these impersonations  You think it's the real person  It does characters  This was going to skyrocket you to middle on the road  We can make him a paper boy in the new movie  Extra extra  Let's go to John in Maine 
[03:39:30]  John  Hey boys  I just wanted to know  Why we're watching Simon Birch on the air  That's funny  People  A lot of people on instant feedback  And this is what I'm getting too  The material isn't bad  Listen  Like there's some stuff  Goathe slip made me damn laugh  I didn't want to laugh  Yeah  But they're saying your voice  And the way you're delivering  Your cadence and your voice  Is destroying any of the material  Of course it is  It's awful  You sound like  When you can have your computer  Read back your text  Have a goatee slip off your head 
[03:40:00]  My dad was good looking  You sound like  Catherine Hepburn  That's what it is  Catherine Hepburn  When he's like  You know Mel Gibson  You stupid old  Put you in a cage  And throw rocks at you  And then his dumb non-confidence  In his jokes  Because he thought he went  Too much over the head  He had to give 18 different examples  Just to let him know  It's an elephant man joke  Y'all 
[03:40:30]  Dada da da da da  Unsure boob  Who's TV?  I was scared  Unsure boob  It's okay to laugh  I am after every punchline  You get it?  Right right  You get it?  Elephant man  Yeah  Hey this is Patrice O'Neal  You are listening to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  I guess which is their best  Really  You know when you think about it  All right, Jimmy's first TV appearance 11 years ago.  Can you tell, I am so hyper right now.  I drank like six cups of coffee backstage.  I feel like I'm talking like a McDonald's hamburger tonight. 
[03:41:00]  No wonder women don't like me.  It is not sexy to be this hyper on a date.  Hi, how are you?  Get away from me.  You look like cousin Ed after chemotherapy.  Oh, God.  I would love to make love to a woman who is just as hyper as I am.  That would be worth filming.  I can't sleep.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's killing with that horse shit. 
[03:41:30]  That's your third comparison bit throughout the set.  He really is, man.  Is this a theme of Cousin It?  He's chewing his finger now.  Are you performing on the Yellow Brick Road right now?  Is that why you're doing so well?  That became your punchline for every joke.  The Hambler Burglar.  Cousin It.  Well, Norton, we used to get him on that formula.  It was take something and add a terrible disease to it. 
[03:42:00]  My feet look like a thing with AIDS.  What?  You have to slip in it, and then you have to die, and then you have to go.  I wish I'd slip in a puddle of that set.  That's what you said.  Why, Rich?  Why?  Let's go back to it.  Keep going.  Keep going.  So it was swing and a miss.  You know, it should be on a mountain stupid.  We weren't even sure.  Hold on.  Hold on.  But the observation, we weren't even sure if it was a swing or a miss yet.  You didn't even give it a chance to sit there for a second.  This show was a destruction of yours, man.  It was so insecure, man.  This is confidence show.  That was right.  What did you say?  I didn't hear what you said.  I just shit on you. 
[03:42:30]  What did you say?  I didn't hear you.  I was fucking shitting on you for no reason.  I'll be very honest.  What did you say?  Your eyes gave away.  Why did you just sound like you're sick to snap?  Did you just...  I didn't even hear you said it.  Jimmy's eyes gave it away.  I don't know people.  I don't know.  What do you like me?  Sometimes, people, I don't hear what people say.  Eh.  Eh.  Oh, you really do sound like a fairy.  All right.  Let's get back to the tape.  Come on.  Oh, please, please.  We're trying to, like, get some more.  Jimmy's so uncomfortable.  He's chewing on his fingers.  He's, like, he's really uncomfortable with this.  We've got to kind of go in a speed round. 
[03:43:00]  They're really making me cringe.  The only reason is because they're going to cut us off because we haven't taken many breaks.  I think we've got another 10 or 15 in us, but after that, it's pushing it.  I am so lonely.  Any hookers here?  No, I don't get hookers.  I don't understand, in this day and age, why is prostitution illegal?  What is prostitution?  It's paying somebody for sex.  That's against the law.  Is it really, Carl?  Now, pornography is totally legal, and what is that?  It's paying somebody for sex and then showing it to the world. 
[03:43:30]  What the hell is the difference?  So, if you're going to get hookers, take my advice.  Bring a video camera.  This way, if the police kick in your door and yell, what the hell is going on in there?  You can just jump back and yell, cut!  See?  I like the little, see?  Do you understand?  Can I ask that question?  When you said, are there any hookers here, and nobody responded, did you go, did you snap  your fingers and go, darn?  Like, did you make a little hand movement? 
[03:44:00]  It wouldn't surprise me if I did.  Gosh darn it.  I wish they were listening.  Thank God we can't clear that up.  Jimmy's high voice makes mine sound very bassy from the 80s.  Oh, my God.  It is just hard.  I thought I had a high voice back in the day.  Jimmy sounds like he's two inches tall.  That's funny, Bloss.  I sound like your fingers.  He just, he thought, I'm trying, there's something that he sounds like, but I can't get the exact, 
[03:44:30]  it's just...  Urkel.  It's motherfucking Urkel.  Yes, it's just...  It's somebody who's trying too hard.  He really is.  That's what it is.  It's somebody who's trying too hard.  He wanted to represent the rest of these Jersey Hacks.  He wanted to show Bob Levy, I can do it.  And you actually told your jokes like you were reading off a cue card.  Are there any hookers?  I don't know why.  If you can down porn, you should be able to fuck porn. 
[03:45:00]  Shut up.  And that voice should never make points.  He should only go knock, knock.  That's a knock, knock who's their voice.  All right, here we go.  More Norton.  We're getting to the interview portion.  Oh, good.  That's really...  I try to sound like Charlie.  I want to talk about something that's important.  I was almost killed today.  This is true.  I was cut off.  Thank you for laughing at that.  I was almost killed by ribs.  I was cut off by a tractor trailer.  I have an air fan.  Stop it.  What was that?  What did you just say?  I think I improv'd. 
[03:45:30]  No, you didn't because you'd be a hole in the back of your head.  Why can't you just...  It was all on Jimmy.  It was all piled on Jimmy.  Yeah, you can't be part of these anymore.  And you bring it right back to yourself.  You can't be part of these anymore.  That's right.  Don't fuck yourself.  I got a million great lines.  Then we end up beating you up instead of beating up the guy that we want to beat up.  All right, go to him.  All in the back of my head.  I try to throw something out.  Fuck you.  I slammed you guys last time I was in here.  Barely.  So I'll barely my fucking ass play the one where he talked about taking a shower with 
[03:46:00]  his brother.  Exactly.  Don't get a hole in the head.  Don't get on me.  All right.  I'm just trying.  You're sitting here.  I live amongst you people.  You throw out a bunch of two stick goods.  You fake seven handicap.  I just want to hear.  Well, the boss cheats and then he says he shoots under 80.  It just needs to be session.  I don't fucking cheat.  Are you crazy?  I've played enough golf with you.  I never cheat.  What, Bob?  And you don't tan either.  Just the sun out all the time around you.  Yeah, exactly. 
[03:46:30]  Another Mercury vacation.  Fuck yourself.  What were you saying?  I just...  When you fake laugh, that little...  Was that...  Oh, you heard that too...  Yeah, man.  That's nerves, right?  Yeah, it's nerves.  It's got to be nerves.  No, no, it wasn't nerves.  It was...  Let me tell you what it is.  Norton is known now to be little mean guy, little mean crazy guy.  Before, he wasn't sure that people weren't going to accept any of his little so-called  horse shit edgy material.  So he had to give him a little laugh to say, I was trying to be funny with you guys. 
[03:47:00]  It's the same as the guy that does this.  It was the same thing.  It's the fear of silence after a punchline.  It was the same as the guy goes, did you hear that?  Like, I went down there and it was Tuesday.  You guys know what I'm talking about?  Listen, are you explaining that to who you're explaining that?  To the people listening.  Because they don't know the comedians.  But also explain that you stink.  No, but I mean...  But it's a...  I mean nothing, Haley, in voice.  Jimmy's making a really good point.  Yeah, there's a fear of silence.  Jimmy brought a great thing to our radio show because when we bombed doing our shit on  the air, we wanted to cover that up with... 
[03:47:30]  Oh, it was so uncomfortable.  We wanted to cover it up with fake laughter or just move on immediately.  And Jimmy taught us how to just slow the fuck down and enjoy the bomb, enjoy the uncomfortableness.  Yeah, I was scared of that.  But back then...  But that's why it's interesting.  Back then, you were like...  You were nervous.  Like, he wanted to fill up the dead space.  He wasn't comfortable.  Right.  So that little...  Yeah, it was awful.  How old is it go?  I don't remember.  Just try.  No.  Just try to do it.  Why don't we just play it on tape?  Why would you be so nervous?  Because I almost killed my ribs. 
[03:48:00]  I was cut off by a cracker trailer.  Oh, my ribs.  I was doing the audience because they laughed, but I was almost killed.  So I was trying to be, like, really funny and off the cuff.  Is that where frunkus came from right there?  No.  That sounds very frunkus-y to you.  Frunkus is only a year or too old.  I was trying to get to this.  A frunkus is two years old.  I was good.  All right, let's try to get to this.  You little bastard.  Cut off.  Thank you for laughing at that.  Because I almost killed my ribs.  I was cut off by a cracker trailer.  Now, I have an airbag in my car. 
[03:48:30]  It's called body.  A driver's side airbag.  A few of you nodding.  You have an airbag?  It is such a hazard to have one.  Because when you have an airbag, your horn is not where it's supposed to be, is it?  Fuck you.  Right?  It's not in the middle of the steering wheel where it's been for 80 years.  And that's where you need it when there's a truck coming.  You want the horn right there.  You know, you drive it.  Truck!  Bonk, bonk!  You don't have that with an airbag.  You have these little crappy rectangular horns up in the corner.  What the hell is that?  It's not a horn.  It's a chiclet.  Sounds like your voice.  You hear a... 
[03:49:00]  And it's not the same when there's a truck coming.  It's like, truck!  Fishing around for the buttons, were you?  Oh, dude.  Jimmy can't look.  I'm going to die in two seconds.  My car has a G-spot and I can't find the damn thing.  All right.  Another funny wrap-up.  Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jim Norton.  Thank you very much.  All right.  My name is Jim Norton.  Hey, gentlemen.  My name's Jim Norton.  Did you hear the desperation of the audience just wanting to go along with him?  I know.  Like he did this horse shit horn thing and they're just going, 
[03:49:30]  Boy, we like him, but he stinks.  Come on.  Listen to me.  This is what stinks about him.  Everything is so profound.  What I'm about to say is gonna rock your world.  But it's in this voice.  I have an airbag.  Does anybody else have an airbag?  Oh, you do?  Applaud for yourself.  Shut the fuck up.  These things are dangerous, people.  And then he ends it with...  Can I ask Jimmy something?  When we did this a few weeks ago, do you have anything to say to the old Jim Norton? 
[03:50:00]  Good job, kid.  I enjoyed talking to the old Opie.  It was like therapy.  I yelled at him.  Let me tell you something.  Throw him out of the gondola of that balloon.  If I could sit down with the old Jim Norton, I'd be gentle.  Okay.  I'd say, look, you're funny.  Stop being such a worm and begging.  It's embarrassing.  You are begging.  You're humiliating yourself.  If a joke doesn't get a laugh, bask in the silence for a moment and move on.  Patrice wants to say that to the Jim Norton now. 
[03:50:30]  Then Norton did a post-performance interview.  This never aired, by the way.  Seriously, you deserve to be fucking taken under a porch and blow some guy.  You deserve to be molested with that stupid voice.  Ouch.  That's hurtful.  We're just trying to have fun here.  What happened?  Why are you yelling at him now?  Why would you want him to be molested?  Because he scares me, Rich.  All right, here. 
[03:51:00]  Here's Norton doing a little post-performance interview.  All right, five, four, three, two, one.  I know me, too.  Are we both sitting up?  Jim, thanks a lot for being here.  Thank you.  Reminding you to sit up, the bad posture.  Yeah, like a comma.  Exactly.  I can't believe this is your first television show.  You did a great job.  Yeah, it felt good.  It was just, it takes a little bit of getting used to, like looking up at the audience  as opposed to looking straight ahead like in a comedy club.  But I had a great time.  They were great.  Good.  It wasn't too hard, huh?  No, no.  It was good.  You just can't curse. 
[03:51:30]  You got to like edit yourself.  You should be zipping along.  But they were good people.  Hey, who was that?  Zipping along.  Who was the interviewer?  You were zipping along.  I don't know.  Jill Nicolini.  You have to look up instead of straight ahead.  That's, uh...  I just, I hate...  If you can see the video, I'm really trying to be like this charming guy who's comfortable  on television.  Oh, no, you are.  I got to see this.  How come she said, thank you for having me sit up or something?  Actually, she was talking about sitting up straight or something like that.  We were just both on these benches or these stools.  Oh, and she looked at your heart? 
[03:52:00]  Oh, I'm just asking.  I couldn't get it.  I knew what she just did.  You think I didn't know you bailed out of a joke and made it serious?  Well, no, no.  Good.  You just sat up.  Good part.  Fuck.  I'm talking to you like I'm your fucking neighbor.  Dumb tricks.  That's so funny, motherfuckers trying to do the comedy tricks on each other.  Yeah, exactly.  We got more of the interview.  Well, how long have you been doing stand-up?  About five years.  About five years.  That's not very long then.  No, I started when I was 21.  I was working in a warehouse and I just, I always wanted to do comedy. 
[03:52:30]  You know, Richard Pryor, 1980, I wanted to do, I have to plug Pryor.  If he's watching, which I know he is, I wanted to do comedy since I saw him.  How did you realize you had that talent?  Oh.  You gave him MS.  That's really embarrassing.  How can a guy that had a style that you had dedicate, you know, like.  Well, I didn't rip him off Pryor.  He was just the guy that made me want to do it.  Not that you ripped him off.  I'm just saying you would think that the style would be more conversational. 
[03:53:00]  He was an influence.  That doesn't mean he's supposed to do Pryor.  Not that he was supposed to do Pryor.  No, you just have influences and then you find your own voice.  Brian Regan is like, if you go, man, I like Brian Regan, you can see where, you know.  What did Patricia say and I get?  It's like, why would you be more conversational?  I mean, he sounds, Norton sounds like he's selling elixirs.  Because he was still working on his shit.  Well, buy this and it will cure everything.  The flu to the cold. 
[03:53:30]  Here you go.  Try this.  It works for me.  He's still trying to work out his shit, man.  Your wagon just takes off.  All right.  I mean, I had a vision when I first got into radio, but, you know, it took a while to get there.  At least I come off of my interview as charming.  Yeah.  And wide-spoken.  It's Zip Pryor, too.  Let's go back to it.  Zip Pryor.  How did you realize you had that talent?  Failing in school.  Failing in school.  Getting thrown out and winning Class Clown and the whole nine yards of school.  Yes.  I was a failure in school and that kind of showed me that I had something other than scholastics to work for. 
[03:54:00]  Okay.  Well, what do you like most about doing stand-up?  It's like, I'm a quick fix junkie.  It's like, you know immediately if you're doing well.  You know immediately if you're involved.  All right.  No, no, no.  Stop.  Acting or anything else, which is another type of a skill you don't know until it's released.  I like that because I want to know now how I'm doing.  Patrice.  Are you a quick fix junkie?  Hold on.  How aggravated do you get when people come up to you, were you the class clown?  All right.  And you just admit it going, I was the class clown. 
[03:54:30]  I know I admit it.  You threw that stereotype to the whole fucking world.  You got to get off the quick fix, son.  Listen.  You want to know how you're doing?  You stink.  Here's your quick fix.  I'm an idiot.  You suck.  Nobody likes you.  You're a piece of shit.  A wacky high-pitched douchebag.  Positive affirmations.  Dude, you're garbage.  Your therapist doesn't even like you.  Dude, you deserved it.  You're going to spun that around quick, didn't you?  That was really zippy. 
[03:55:00]  He zipped that one around.  We were surprised.  Let's see.  He's a quick fix junkie.  He's crazy.  Finally, the last part of the interview.  Personally, I mean.  What do you like least about it?  Being judged by an audience.  I don't even mind bombing.  I mean, I don't mind that, but I hate when, like, you tell a joke and a crack goes, uh.  The heckling and that kind of.  Yeah, or if they're judging a joke.  It's like, if you don't think it's funny, don't laugh, but don't groan at me, because  you know you're going to go home and write Scarface anyway.  And it's a tough thing to do, so they shouldn't be judging you.  Well, yeah.  I mean, if you don't like something, I can accept that.  Right.  I just don't like being, uh, you know, that. 
[03:55:30]  I got what you're saying.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Where do you get your material from?  Trying to get it from my own experience.  If not, I'll just watch Comedy Central and steal.  Don't do that.  Now, if you weren't a set-up comedian, what do you think you'd be doing for a living?  She stinks.  I've been in the warehouse before.  And, uh, probably that.  I'm very lucky.  You know, I'm very grateful to, uh, to be where I am right now.  Where is that?  I don't know what I'd be doing, to be honest with you.  It was like, I know what I wanted to do since I was a kid, so it's either this or nothing.  Right.  Well, you're on the right track.  Thank you.  Good luck to you.  Thanks.  Thanks for being here.  Appreciate it.  Okay. 
[03:56:00]  Absolutely appreciate it.  Actually, this is nothing.  What an asshole she is.  Like, she was a little.  Ah, she doesn't really know what she's doing.  The fact that you just compared that set to Scarface.  The fact, a classic, compared to that fucking heel.  You should be at kids' parties blowing up balloons with that voice, okay?  No, I wasn't saying that.  I was only saying it when they judged material.  I can't believe my point back then went over his head.  I wasn't judging you.  I'm exaggerating.  I know what you were doing.  It's a joke. 
[03:56:30]  Anthony laughed.  Shut up.  You should see my Charmy face, though.  I want to see that video because I just...  Is it up on the site?  Watching Jim in here, sitting through that, his head was slightly down.  He put his forehead on his hand and just had his eyes shut.  You really cannot...  Certain moments of that are...  No one can sit through that.  I know.  We couldn't either.  That's why it was fun to watch.  Some parts of it don't bother me.  I just laugh at it.  Other parts, I'm like, oh, you...  Because they're revealing as to what a little douche I was. 
[03:57:00]  And Richard Pryor.  Yeah, yeah, Richard Pryor.  He's watching, yeah.  You know...  This kid's good.  What's his name?  When we played our audio from 12 years ago, I went home depressed.  Did you?  Yeah, I really thought I had something 12 years ago.  I had nothing.  Oh, my God.  I went home depressed.  Yeah, but he grew.  I'm glad you said that, Opie.  I'm not even fucking kidding.  No, but I'm glad you said that in comparison.  That was Opie's way of saying, hey, we all stunk when we was younger.  Yeah, that's fair.  You stunk.  I did.  More than all of us.  It wasn't.  No, I will not accept the ending of that. 
[03:57:30]  We can stop it with I stunk, but not more than all of you.  All right.  Listen, we got to do line of the day.  Don't look at me, you cocksucker.  Why?  I can't look at you.  You're right here.  How do I not look at you?  Everywhere I look, there you are.  Straight ahead and in the peripheral.  All at the same time.  Oh, shit.  That's right.  You're eating up my perif, kid.  Maybe you should use your high-pitched voice to pop me.  What?  Oh.  Kick it. 
[03:58:00]  Fucking shudder.  How are you doing?  Hey, this is Robert Kelly, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It was awful.  Worthless.  They're the worst.  Just screaming every racial epithet you can think of.  An abomination.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, we were talking about technology earlier today. 
[03:58:30]  With what?  The tracking?  Oh, the tracking button.  There were a few things we were talking about.  There's a bit that's been kind of hanging around, and it's perfect for Nick, I think.  Commercials of biggest product failures ever.  Biggest product failures ever.  Commercials of biggest product?  Anthony's going to remember most of these.  Yeah, yeah.  I look at the list, I remember...  Much a lot more shit.  So will Fanny probably audition for most of them.  I remember about four of these.  You guys all blew them.  Four of these. 
[03:59:00]  So let's start with this fine commercial for...  Polar Vision.  Polar Vision.  Imagine if someone invented a wonderful box and gave you a way to catch little pieces of  your life so that you could see them again anytime by just dropping them into the box.  Now, wouldn't that be something?  Well, it is something.  Polar Vision.  Polaroids.  Instant movies.  Seconds after you shoot, you've got it.  And you'll still have it, even when certain persons go off to college. 
[03:59:30]  Or die.  Oh.  Instant movies, huh?  Wow.  I guess a little something called video killed that whole fucking idea, didn't it?  Yeah.  What was that about?  What year was that?  You could develop film.  Oh, can I go backwards again?  He was a white guy once again being betrayed in a commercial as a mama Luke.  Anyways.  Oh, yeah.  A hairy white guy with no shirt on.  There you go.  Unlikable fucking lump.  As a surprise, the cop is white, though. 
[04:00:00]  That's a surprise.  I know.  That did surprise me.  As this fat wife gets the shirt out of the dryer.  There you go.  All right.  So what do you got?  Polar Vision.  Do you remember this, Ant?  Yeah.  It was just like...  Because Polaroid put it out.  It was just like their regular still cameras.  But it was with film.  And I remember it was pathetically short.  Like you couldn't really film a lot.  A couple seconds.  Yeah.  It was really short.  And it didn't come out very well.  And then video kind of killed it.  Do we know why these things failed? 
[04:00:30]  Video.  Because any type of moving picture thing you would think would have done very well.  Maybe it was right before something else.  Sometimes if they came out right before a much better technology, that's probably why.  Right.  What year was that?  Yeah.  42.  1942.  You got it, Dan?  Late 70s, it looks like.  Oh, late 70s.  Jesus.  Okay.  People already gearing up for the video camcorders and stuff.  And now you got it on your cell phone.  Done.  Yeah.  But does it creep you out all that the late 70s was over 30 years ago? 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, I know.  Freight.  I think that's like, what the fuck happened?  I was 16, 17.  Yeah.  Where'd that go?  What the fuck, man?  We said the 70s was the greatest decade.  Jimmy, what's...  I'm chilly, Ope.  I'm drinking a goddamn pool thing.  And I remember thinking like, the year 2000 was going to be some fucking amazing futuristic  bullshit thing.  In the 70s, I was thinking, holy shit.  Yeah.  Now, the year 2000 is going to be amazing.  Space and fucking, we're going to mile our suits.  We're going to be flying around in cars.  We're flying around like the fucking guy checking on women putting their frozen food 
[04:01:30]  in baggies.  That commercial?  What the fuck was it?  I thought...  Remember the guy with a jet pack?  Yeah.  Checking in.  Fucking guy.  Yeah, he had the jet pack and he'd come...  Make sure you're keeping things fresh and you ziplock back.  I thought we'd wake up in the year 2000, the first day, and there'd be a big news bulletin  where to drop off your car and get your flying car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like, okay, we're just waiting until the year 2000 and then you get to drop your car  off and get the brand new, unbelievable car. 
[04:02:00]  We got more conveniences.  I think we didn't see...  I think we thought it was going to be a lot more mechanical advances than computer advances.  It is all computer.  It's all computer and electronics now.  The car is still an internal combustion fucking engine.  Right.  It looks better, but it's still...  You fucking put gas in it and you drive and there's telephone poles and there's this  stuff.  But you have your nav systems.  You got your computerized crap in there.  Your phones with the cameras and everything else. 
[04:02:30]  That's pretty much...  We didn't see that coming, but...  And I'm going to die by the hands of a fucking iPod in my car.  That was designed to paralyze you.  They might as well put a picture of somebody with a feed tube in their fucking...  I mean, I've come this close to hitting the fucking wall on the Sawmill Parkway.  Every night that I drive into the cellar, I'm scrolling through my playlist looking for  fucking air supply.  Looking for that inspirational song that gets you ready for your set.  Yes!  And I fucking look up.  I'm a cunt here.  Away from the...  Whoa! 
[04:03:00]  If they ever fucking came up with something more dangerous than driving and talking on  a cell phone...  Yeah, it's sad.  It's driving and texting.  Fucking scrolling through a list.  Scroll through a list.  Because now you're reading.  You're looking down.  And texting you.  You're doing everything you're not supposed to do.  I don't need to look out the window.  And when you start thinking about...  Like, I'm doing fucking 70 miles an hour.  This thing is hurtling with no eyes.  It's now an unguided bomb.  And I'm trying to find the comma button.  Yeah.  That fucking...  Yeah. 
[04:03:30]  I don't want to...  And you know, you look up and somebody's in a dead standstill 50 feet ahead of you.  How's that going to end?  And it feels so natural too because I was just driving and went up to the mountains over  the weekend and all of a sudden my girl's like, what are you doing?  And I'm driving 70, 75 miles an hour.  I'm like, I'm emailing Kenny.  What's your problem?  Like...  Just fucking...  You're staring with like your index finger.  You don't even think twice about it.  Like, what?  I'm just emailing Kenny.  Picture years ago.  Picture years ago.  Your dad in the car. 
[04:04:00]  And as he's driving, he's typing a letter next to him with a big fucking old typewriter.  Yeah.  Ding.  And driving down the street.  You'd be going, what the fuck are you doing?  And that's exactly what you're doing.  It's the fucking...  And people are dying every day because of that shit.  Every day.  Every day.  Those girls upstate about...  Yep.  Five of them or something.  Swerved.  And it was right...  They had the proof that she was on her fucking black belt.  Yeah.  In the middle of a text.  What was she writing?  Just wham.  Just a...  I don't know.  Writing I Miss You or something. 
[04:04:30]  Because it's all mundane crap anyway.  You're right.  Hopefully it was something like, I can't wait to suck that big black and then you just hear...  Oh.  Ouch.  What about the naughty...  You know, I thought by the year 2000...  LOL.  Lost our legs.  Yeah.  R-A-L-L.  Rolling all over freeway.  Wow.  It is made for that shit.  It really is.  And I can't believe...  And I tell my wife about it. 
[04:05:00]  I remember reading going...  I read something in the paper.  It's like, yeah, seven out of ten accidents are caused by...  The next day she gets me like a fucking thing I can plug into the...  I'm like...  Yeah.  Yeah.  The hands free.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought by the year 2000 we would figure out the whole like driving like...  When you're driving down the highway and another car is coming at you.  Yeah.  I thought they would have figured that out by now.  Like maybe make two separate fucking lanes.  That it's impossible to get into a head-on collision in this day and age.  Why am I trusting not one or two, but hundreds and hundreds of other drivers... 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  ...as I speed by them as they're going the other way?  Yeah.  Why can't we figure that shit out?  That none of these cars bump together.  Yeah.  And they're not on tracks.  You know, if...  Back in the day, if you saw one car coming at you, you'd be freaked out.  But now we don't even...  We take it for granted.  There's just...  You're just assuming they're going to do the right thing.  And they're not on their fucking iPods.  That's right.  That's how Kinnison died.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Guy swerved into his fucking lane.  Right into his lane.  Yep.  Wham.  For that fucking day.  And then bragged about it. 
[04:06:00]  What do you mean bragged about it?  He bragged...  Yeah, that he was the guy that killed Sam Kinnison.  It's on his resume.  He used to go around saying, yeah, I was the guy that killed Kinnison.  He used to, like, walk around...  Was he bragging about it?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was a fucking scumbag.  Absolutely.  Yeah, we could get his brother on.  He'll tell you the whole story.  We've had Sam's brother on a few times.  All right, here's another commercial for another product that failed miserably.  Meet the lady.  Her name is Lisa.  And she is the most exciting thing to happen in computers today. 
[04:06:30]  The lady Lisa.  Beautiful.  A classic triumph for Apple.  Pure and simple graphic images and a clever pointing device called a mouse.  But most importantly, unlimited expandability.  Unlimited power.  Lisa from Apple.  The future today at Wallace Micromart.  Ah, is that a computer?  Yes, from Apple.  You remember the...  Ah.  It was called the Apple Lisa?  Yeah.  Isn't she beautiful, huh? 
[04:07:00]  Lisa.  That thing is stupid.  What an ugly fucking machine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is that a portable?  But see, back then it wasn't about something looking good.  82.  That's right.  It was about, you know what.  That's right.  Let's see what it's got.  It's got 5.25 inch twiggy floppy drives.  That's nice.  All right.  It was supposed to be the, like, Mac pretty much killed it.  I mean, yeah, the Apple Mac killed this.  Some support for up to two megabytes of RAM? 
[04:07:30]  Really?  Wow.  Two meg...  What do you store on that one letter?  Dear Frank, I need a new computer.  High five me, someone.  I'll give you an air one.  All right.  Across the table.  It had a 5 megahertz processor.  Oh, my...  You know, someone is still waiting for a response.  They sent something at 82 and it's still downloading.  5 megahertz.  On his Lisa.  Is that good, Jimmy?  And it only takes up half your bedroom. 
[04:08:00]  Yeah.  Like the ENIAC.  It's like a fucking refrigerator with a TV screen and a fucking package from FedEx on  top of it.  You got to kick your twin brother out of your room so you can have a computer.  Oh, wait.  Steve Jobs was forced...  God, this fucking LASIK works.  I can read that from here.  Wow.  Steve Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, so he joined the Macintosh project instead.  Contrary to popular belief, the Macintosh is not a direct descendant of the Lisa, although  there are obvious similarities between the systems and the final revision. 
[04:08:30]  The Lisa 210 was modified and sold as the Macintosh.  Oh.  I can't believe I could see that from here.  Lisa 210.  That was my girlfriend's nickname.  And I just go...  What?  You ready to move on to the next one?  Yeah.  I can read from here.  I got 22,000.  That's right.  Can we...  The next one?  Whatever you need read, I'll read it.  Well, no.  Need something read?  I'll read.  That's why we played the audio, so it's less reading for us. 
[04:09:00]  Oh.  We figured that one out, fuck, two, three years ago.  Arch Deluxe.  Do you remember this product?  Not by name.  I see you press L.  Do you L might stand for lobby?  But for me, Chef Andrew.  L stands for lettuce.  Crisp iceberg lettuce.  Just one of the ingredients on McDonald's Arch Deluxe.  America's favorite new burger.  I just can't help myself.  I love it.  What was the problem with a burger?  Yeah, it was a burger with lettuce and tomato.  No, they fucking...  Now it's the Arch Deluxe one.  Seriously.  Do you know, Thad, why did this product fail? 
[04:09:30]  I'm looking at a picture of it right now.  Because it had been a wrong...  Biggest product failures ever.  The Arch Deluxe.  What was wrong with it?  Because it was trying to compete with the Whopper.  I know why.  They put avocado on it.  Avocado.  Avocado.  It was just like a burger.  Yeah, it was a burger.  Because they were trying to compete with lettuce and tomato.  Yeah, they were trying to do the fucking Whopper thing.  But they didn't have that, so they used octopus cum.  And they thought it would take off...  Is that the special sauce?  Nothing more delicious than a warm tomato on a burger. 
[04:10:00]  Fucking stupid.  Is that the only thing?  Dumb tomatoes and lettuce?  It really was.  They put it in a nice box.  You can see what...  It's got...  Yeah, a bun, secret sauce.  Yeah.  Onions, lettuce, tomato, beef.  Somebody was working overtime.  American cheese.  Wow.  But wasn't this the McDLT?  See, I'm confused.  That shows your marketing.  They just rename shit and sell it to you again.  Remember the McDLT?  It was the burger on one side, and then the lettuce and tomato on the other. 
[04:10:30]  You're right.  And it was in some big styrofoam box.  It was homeless people living in their mouth.  Yeah.  If one of these things would ruin the environment, you'd throw it out.  Yeah, that's what ruined the fucking...  Yeah.  The ozone.  I blame the ancestors again.  Those dopes.  I forgot about that.  It was also...  We've been attacking the ancestors all morning long in there, Nick.  Yeah, I heard that.  Yeah, you were part of it.  You got in on that.  Power of a window.  Who would have come up in that?  It was also, I guess, very expensive.  Oh, is that the problem?  Yeah, pickles were going through the roof in 86. 
[04:11:00]  Fucking...  Yeah.  McDonald's spent $300 on research production and marketing for the Arch Deluxe.  How much?  $300 million.  Oh, $300 million.  That guy's working at a car wash in Seattle.  Look at this.  Yeah, I was the guy.  I used to be some...  Shut up.  It's a bad name.  It's a bad name for a product.  Arch Deluxe.  Arch Deluxe.  Yeah, it sounds like a guy's name.  They should just call it...  Coach Arch Deluxe went 7-0 this year on the SEC.  They should just call it the Chopper or something.  I mean, they ripped it off the Whopper.  Just changed the first letter.  How about the unoriginal burger? 
[04:11:30]  Yeah.  Right.  That's right.  How about the hoo-hoo burger?  That's right.  How about the cunt on a bun?  That sounds crazy to us, but...  Sounds crazy?  What are you talking about?  That's fantastic.  Well, think of word of mouth.  I mean, come on.  That's right.  Cunt on a bun.  Can I have some cow-asshole cooking?  Why not?  Let's go to McDonald's.  Have eat and cuntin'.  All right.  We're going to go to the next product.  I got a funny joke, too.  The Chicken McNuggets.  Like, I'm like, what?  I don't know chickens have nuggets.  I give the crowd a look like we all know where I'm going with this.  You know, it's all how you look at them. 
[04:12:00]  You're the worst.  I got a fucking Cialis rod right now.  You're looking at him like Ronnie Gold.  You want to see his Cialis hard-on, Nick?  He likes to show people.  It just happens sometimes.  I'm looking at something on Paddle Talk.  You say Cialis?  You say Cialis.  Oh, tomato, tomato.  It all equals this.  He's just the worst.  I just knocked over my fucking...  Oh, my God.  See that?  Oh, I just knocked over my fucking goddamn juice.  It's like a bad ad for Cialis. 
[04:12:30]  You're just the worst.  No special times.  Yeah, I knocked it over with my hard cock.  That's a great ad for Cialis.  That's good.  I fucking knocked over my juice.  You're going to pull a China Syndrome.  I can still drink it, though.  All right, let's go to the next one.  You ready here?  Tampons.  And you all right?  Here we go.  Oh, fantastic.  All right, here's the next product failure.  Now, this one we all know.  Finally.  If you think network television is a little boring, start your own network.  With a Sony Betamax and a portable Sony videotape camera, you can do just that. 
[04:13:00]  You can record what you want, when you want, and watch what you want, when you want.  It's the best family entertainment on television.  One more shot, Ma.  Come on, smile.  This is the best birthday I've ever had.  Oof.  Oh, my God.  I know.  Smile.  Fucking whining old bitty.  Oh, my God.  He walked in while she was sleeping with, like, the Mexican gardener, and she popped up,  and his dick was in.  Come on, Ma.  Smile.  Smile.  And he ruined her good birthday, and that's why she was crying. 
[04:13:30]  Fucking blubbering idiot, Ma.  Lighten up.  It's a camera.  Fucking data.  Hey, Ma.  It's a Polaroid.  Take a picture of your clit and give it to Dad.  Jesus Christ.  Fluff it up.  Wow.  We love our Canadian callers.  Hunter, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Good evening.  Yeah.  McDonald's had pizza, like, six, seven years ago in Canada.  I don't know if he had it there in the States.  They did.  It was pretty awful. 
[04:14:00]  Yeah.  Pizza McDonald's?  Yeah, it was called, like, McPizza.  Seriously?  Yeah.  Fucking.  We're like, no.  We're like, boy, that must have went away in a week.  Because I'll eat any pizza.  Yeah, we're not McDiggin' that.  So it was a big McFlop.  And McSucks.  I know.  I can remember that.  And I love pizza.  I don't give a shit.  What kind of.  Me too.  You give me a piece of pizza, I'm happy.  Yeah, baby.  What do we know about the Betamax?  Just, it was just.  It was.  It was.  Yeah, legendary failure. 
[04:14:30]  Yeah.  Flop.  Beta tape.  Didn't quite catch on.  Yeah, why?  How come it was outdone by the other version?  VHS.  People liked it better.  I don't know why.  And the VHS was bigger.  It was bigger, yeah.  Which was so dumb about it.  And the beta was on a loop, I believe.  It was almost like a cart.  Like, it was.  It was on a loop.  I put 40 grand into that, too.  Damn it.  I always picked the wrong one.  What?  You guys need anything red?  No, we don't, eagle eye.  I can see the value. 
[04:15:00]  I can't read across the room.  But I had bad eyes for many years, Nick.  Well, that's.  It doesn't surprise me when you're having Korean pee in your fucking retina.  Read Steve's sexuality.  What?  I can read that, too.  I have fucking.  I have better vision.  I don't have x-ray vision.  Wow.  Sony produced a scaled-down version.  I just took the wind out of my own sails.  As the sails go.  I was just sailing along.  Flapping fluttered down.  And they just flopped down limply. 
[04:15:30]  That's that last joke.  It wasn't even a swing and a miss.  The bat was limp.  I swung a fucking wet spaghetti noodle.  I didn't help with the setup, that's for sure.  You're adrift with the tide.  No, you didn't.  Can you see Steve's sexuality?  Go.  Yeah, that was horrendous on my part.  Let's go to the next product failure.  Suck this cock.  This one, everyone knows.  This was just a dumb, dumb idea.  I will now predict the exact moment in time when every single one of you will enjoy the best-tasting Coca-Cola ever.  It will be the very moment that you pick up this can. 
[04:16:00]  Because inside this can is the new taste of Coca-Cola.  The best-tasting Coca-Cola ever.  You will taste the new taste immediately.  I remember this.  And you will like it a lot.  Now, if you're a Coke drinker, wait until you taste this one.  And if you're a Pepsi drinker, well, I predict we're going to be real friendly from here on in for a long, long time.  It was called Coca-Cola Jew.  New Coke.  Yeah, it was a big failure.  They say it's probably the biggest failure ever by a big company. 
[04:16:30]  They also say it was kind of calculated that they wanted to put out a new Coke that sucked and then bring back the old Coke under a brand new classic Coke thing to really pump that up.  That's pretty fucking brave, man.  Take that chance.  But it's Coke.  So how brave could it be?  People are going to fucking buy it.  What was the deal?  Pepsi was starting to take over and Coke's numbers weren't that bad.  Yeah.  I'm doing that with my career right now.  I'm doing a lot of shitty comedy. 
[04:17:00]  That's how fucking funny I was in the 80s.  Make it seem better.  Yeah.  The boys are starting a new bit.  Now they're telling us.  Well, it's Lady Trucker.  She officially started the bit.  Hi, fellas.  This is a 65 mile an hour feedback.  She's going 65 miles an hour.  Yeah, she's typing you.  When will Black Phil be on the radio again?  What the fuck is Black Phil?  Was it this past Saturday or this coming Saturday?  Patrice O'Neill does a show here on Saturday nights every once in a while called Black Phil. 
[04:17:30]  I think it's good.  It didn't just pass, right?  I think it's maybe this Saturday.  What?  It did just pass?  Danny?  April 5th is the next show.  April 5th.  Okay.  Tune in.  All right.  The next product failure.  P.C. Jr., a bright little addition to the family.  Jr. comes with bright computer ideas, like a keyboard that doesn't need a cord.  You can get easy-to-use software like word processing, games and graphics your kids won't believe, 
[04:18:00]  plus a starting price you won't believe.  And with easy-to-add options, Jr. can grow up real fast.  P.C. Jr., new from IBM.  Thank you, Kitty Carlisle.  What the fuck?  Got a 90-year-old lady pushing your product?  That might have been the first problem.  Try to unplug the keyboard.  What was the problem with the P.C. Jr.?  It was expensive.  It was trying to compete, and they wanted $4 million for it.  Failure in the marketplace.  Failure in the marketplace. 
[04:18:30]  Why did it fail?  It says at $669, the P.C. Jr.'s price was not competitive.  Why would you buy the Jr. and fucking Sr. who's available?  Obviously, he had much more fucking wisdom and memory.  Experience.  Yeah, it was twice as much as the Commodore 64 and the Atari 8-bit family.  Eh.  Hmm.  Too much money.  Let's say hi to Ben in Georgia.  Ben.  Going into the computer business.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Big fan of the show.  I just wanted to point out, I heard that the reason why Beta did not surprise was that 
[04:19:00]  the porn industry actually embraced VHS.  Wow.  It went over the edge.  Fucking great point.  Great point.  Really?  You might be right, man.  Yeah.  Can you imagine that?  I have no idea where I heard that from.  What else would you need to watch at home alone?  Pornography.  So whatever, like, that was probably the first take-home videos, because you could watch movies  at home.  Well, I don't know.  I had a lot of nice home movies in my family, having picnics and playing football.  Oh, but Nick, you know Nick, you're next to God's ears. 
[04:19:30]  My sister's wedding.  I kind of like that.  Jerking off to my nieces.  You like reliving that?  That's it.  You guys have always mentioned that pornography is what pushes technology forward.  That's true.  It's got to be.  That's absolutely true.  I had a great video of me, and I was doing a cookout, and I had a fucking thing.  Apron on?  I said, Mom is a little helper, and I threw my wife in the pool, and we laughed.  My brother got married on the roof.  I know who you're talking to, Mom.  Of course you do.  Of course I do.  All right.  Let's say hi to Josh in New Mexico. 
[04:20:00]  Josh.  I don't want him to fuck me.  I think 15 years ago, Pepsi made a Pepsi Clear or Crystal Pepsi, something like that.  I don't remember, because...  Pepsi Clear, yes.  That's all I got.  Punch it out.  It sounds too much like Pepsi Clear stuff.  Snopes is saying that new Coke theory you had, Ant, is like BS.  Well, how do they know?  Because he drives a truck.  How does Snopes know?  Because it's like...  And Bill K. from Philly, hey, hope that porn story is an urban legend as well.  Boy, I guess we're spreading all kinds of disinformation here today. 
[04:20:30]  Yeah, that's not an urban legend.  Fuck us.  What were the first videos?  They were porn videos as far as the biggest sellers.  The biggest seller in the market.  That's not bullshit.  Okay.  And I want to say hi to Timothy McCoy.  He's going 78 miles per hour, feedbacking in the fog, and he just wanted to say hi.  70,000 tons of fucking Idaho potatoes in his truck.  Got a fucking lady in front of him and a Cooper.  All right, let's move on to the next product here. 
[04:21:00]  The DeLorean.  Gull-wing doors rise effortlessly, beckoning you inside.  The sleek, stainless steel DeLorean.  Beautifully crafted for long life.  The DeLorean is one of the most awaited automobiles in automotive history.  Drive the DeLorean.  Live the dream today.  I'm guessing it was the music in the commercial that buried that fucking... 
[04:21:30]  And the...  What's a bird?  Yeah, what the fuck was that?  That's DeLorean, snot and coke.  Dirty ass.  He had a nose whistle.  A little rock of coke in his nose.  Try the DeLorean.  What's the reason why that this thing fell?  They give a reason?  The price?  No, DeLorean fucking fucked it up. 
[04:22:00]  Yeah, remember the undercover sting?  Yeah.  Right?  He was pumping some cars out.  It was, you know, doing all right.  And then he got busted.  Selling coke.  Remember the suitcase with money in it in a hotel?  Oh, yeah.  It was all kinds of great shit.  He fucked up.  How fucking old are we?  Is he still in jail or no?  DeLorean still in jail?  I don't know.  He's probably dead.  And finally, we got the last one here.  Oh, what the fuck? 
[04:22:30]  They'll know you've arrived when you drive up in the 1958 Edsel.  The car that's truly new from nameplate to taillights.  New from the front.  New from the side.  New from the rear.  Only Edsel has the sleek, clean line design that sets it apart from the look-alike cars.  And it combines new looks with the newest V8 engines in the world. 
[04:23:00]  The big new Edsel 400 and the power-packed Edsel 475.  It is unlikely you have ever driven a car with so much real, usable power as the Edsel.  The Edsel.  And with Edsel's exclusive TeleTouch drive, you drive more safely, more easily than you ever have before.  Because both hands can stay at the wheel while the Edsel shifts electrically.  There's even the added luxury of new Edsel air suspension. 
[04:23:30]  That's just like riding on air.  Because you are.  Nice music.  How about lying?  And remember.  The Honeymooners.  All the medium-sized cars.  With the stars.  Art Carney.  The 1958 Edsel is the one that's new and the lowest price, too.  How long were these commercials?  Oh, my God.  Enough about the Edsel.  We get it.  And the best part is it has electric windows you can roll up when Negroes are by. 
[04:24:00]  The big heavy grill is good if Negroes get in your way.  Because you know what they're here to do.  Probably rob you and rape your lovely wife and children.  That's what the German Shepherds and fire hoses are for.  What year is this?  1958.  Yes, 58.  The 58 Edsel.  Wonderful.  We've even tried to cover up the blackness of the tires with white walls. 
[04:24:30]  Because, you know, we don't want anything black on this car.  Pull into your garage and close the door behind you to keep the Negroes away.  Oh, my stomach.  Oh, the 50s.  What are you going to do?  Yeah, that's the guy.  Very intolerant.  That's that voice.  Yeah, he just always had that whole thing.  It's the same guy that did the little films for the kids in school on how to hide under 
[04:25:00]  your desk when there were fucking nuclear bombs.  Oh, the duck and cover.  That's right, Johnny.  Duck and cover.  That's him.  When the communist menace drops its hydrogen bombs on you so you don't burn to a crisp.  Duck and cover, Johnny.  Good boy.  Hide under a piece of quarter-inch pine.  Yes, that will save you.  Some people say radiation is dangerous.  Puppycock.  Your hair might fall out, but it'll grow back. 
[04:25:30]  Same length, same color, same cowlick.  Don't worry about that, kids.  Your government's here to protect you from the commie menace and the Negro.  So light up a lucky strike.  Yes, you, pregnant woman.  Have a drink.  And a lucky.  Good for your baby.  On filth?  Yes.  And let the doctor inject you with some thalidomide.  It's good for your children.  He'll be a hell of a swimmer with those flippers. 
[04:26:00]  Save on yarn.  Sweaters have never been so cheap for grandma to knit.  That's right.  One armhole.  Oh, my stomach is fucking killing me.  Holy shit, that was...  Coming down the red carpet, it's Tracy and Hepburn. 
[04:26:30]  Wonderful.  Look at the couple.  Uh-oh.  Please look out at Negro.  Oh, it's Sidney Poitier.  Sorry, Sidney.  Ah, what a time.  Yeah, they seem to get the same guy for everything.  He was on war films in the 40s and 50s, educational things.  All the shit.  Film strip records when I was a kid.  Beep.  He's got that crew cut and those Jeanine Graffler glasses. 
[04:27:00]  Yeah.  Oh, he's in a suit.  Yeah.  Skinny black tie.  Win that Edward R. Murrow Award.  DeLorean died in 2005.  Of what?  Yeah.  I think it was cancer.  One of his doors in his car hit him under the chump.  Took his head off.  So was a stroke, yeah.  We're doing...  Oh, really?  Coquette died of a stroke?  Go figure that one out.  Oopsie.  I'll be an Anthony.  Mama always said,  Life is like the opening drive. 
[04:27:30]  You never know what you're going to get.  I think you have to fear everybody in the National Football League.  If you don't fear a team,  if you don't take them serious, Pop,  you know that any team can be...  On any given day,  any other team can be the other team,  no matter how good.  If you don't play your best football,  you get beat on Sunday.  The opening drive.  Weekdays, 7 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Sirius NFL Radio Channel 124.  Now part of the...  It's the worst.  It's so good. 
[04:28:00]  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  Slide a finger into me, Bob.  We got this.  Susan Mitchell was in her Davidson County home  during Tuesday evening storms  and heard the weather alerts on TV.  Oh, this dumb bitch.  They were putting tornado watches  and then warnings across the bottom of the screen.  Mitchell says she got scared.  She grabbed her cats and took cover in a bedroom closet.  I fell asleep.  Dummy.  And I woke up and I wanted to get out  and I couldn't get out.  In her rush for safety, 
[04:28:30]  she forgot the closet door locks from the inside.  Why would you have a closet door  that locks from the inside?  In case your shirts want to make a break for it.  And if it locks from the inside,  can't she get out?  Oh, yeah.  It locks from the inside.  It means if it locks from the outside.  Oh, good point.  Good point.  Like, this whole fucking thing is screwy.  Maybe this dumb broad thought  she was locked in her own house.  Yeah.  I can't get out of the closet.  Locked from the inside.  It would be the outside.  And why? 
[04:29:00]  Instead of panicking,  she found a wood panel in the closet.  And tried to bust the door open.  It didn't work.  She slipped a note under a crack in the closet door.  For who?  Help!  I'm trapped in the closet.  Since Tuesday night, Twitter.  What a dumbass.  Why would you put a note outside the door  when you could just yell help?  It's in your closet, yeah.  You hear people there go,  I hope they got my notes.  If anybody's out there, read the note. 
[04:29:30]  Grab that note.  And somebody would read it and go,  I can't read it.  I'm sticking the closet.  How do you stick in a closet when they leave?  Half natural.  Unbelievable.  The closet door.  Help!  I'm trapped in the closet since Tuesday night, 12 a.m.  Just in case someone came looking for her.  20 hours would pass with no food, water, or medication for her diabetes. 
[04:30:00]  Diabetes.  I was trapped in the closet.  I was trapped in the closet, and I had the diabetes.  Yeah.  And Liberty came to the door, and you didn't see my note.  They said, help, I'm trapped in the closet.  So I missed my diabetes medication.  Yeah.  And then they said, why you say it like diabetes?  We're not even going to save you.  Pass.  With no food, water, or medication for her diabetes.  I would have slipped candy under the door.  Here you go.  Eat this, sister.  Lose a couple of toes, you old fucking clumsy twat. 
[04:30:30]  That'll teach you.  Say goodbye to the fucking pinky toe.  That would slip under there.  Fruit roll-ups and ribbon candy.  Here you go.  Be ready for some sleaze stack feet.  Fucking shuffle along, you old burdened.  Just leave the closet under the door one piece at a time.  I'm almost out.  A few fingers left.  As I see that old fucking crooked hand coming under for the note, I would like to grab her  fingers and just yank as hard as I can. 
[04:31:00]  Just fucking break her wrist in the fucking, like pull her hand through the bottom of the  closet door so her hand is sticking out and she feels like an asshole.  It's sticking out like fucking, like thing in fucking The Addams Family.  It's like all of her fingers facing up and then rub your asshole on one so it smells  like shit.  That's funny.  Just fucking take a, stand up and take a leak on her hand.  You see her trying to pull it back in.  Fuck, fuck.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  Sounds like Otto's camera.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. 
[04:31:30]  Otto.  Otto.  Ah, this dummy.  Hey, a lot of questions coming in.  Who the fuck has a pen and pad in the fucking closet?  And then Matt Lafar from Queensbury writes.  Help, help, I'm trapped in the closet, said Steve Cortlisi.  And then someone from Philly writes, how do you got audio, wait, how are you guys playing  audio from Steve's head?  A lot of Steve jokes coming in right now.  Oh, I ripped off a piece of my assless chap and carved in the leather. 
[04:32:00]  She'd be fucking kneeling on the floor in the closet with her face pressed against the  door and her fucking hand stuck to her.  Snapped wrist.  Her fucking stupid charm bracelet.  She'd move and it would just jingle and scratch her.  Stupid silhouettes of her grandkids.  Yes, that's right.  Five faces you'll never see again.  And when a dude opened the closet door, it would hurt her hands so much, she'd have to 
[04:32:30]  crawl quickly with the door so her fucking hand skin didn't get ripped.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  The only way to get it off is when you got the door open, you have to step on her forearm  and just open the door quickly and rip that shitty charm bracelet.  Trying to convince herself a piece of cat shit is a Snickers.  That's funny.  Gnawing away.  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Thanks for a rescue.  Oh, Margo the trucker.  The cats are in the closet with her, right?  Yeah.  Oh, are they?  Yeah, she took the cats and ran into the closet. 
[04:33:00]  Oh, that's great.  You can only hope that this story ends with the cats nibbling on her toes.  Gnawing away at her open wounds that won't heal because of her diabetes.  You can almost hear them going, ah, this dumb cunt, ah, meow, meow.  No tornado or storm hit her house or anything.  Nothing.  Dummy locks herself in a closet.  Fucking idiot.  A knee jerk.  The cats must have been so disgusted with her.  Oh, fuck this baby.  Ammonia piss.  She's just sitting there with her fucking stockings in ammonia piss. 
[04:33:30]  That's what you get.  That's what you get, Ethel.  Let's see what else happened here.  Food, water, or medication for her diabetes.  Oh, boy.  I was so thirsty, I think I would have hit somebody from water.  Instead, she finally thought to hit the wall.  The force of her swing made a hole a little more than a foot wide to crawl through.  Threw another blanket out there on the floor and a pillow and squeezed through the hole.  She bashed the hole in the wall. 
[04:34:00]  Yeah.  And went through.  How long was she in there for?  Like 20 hours.  She didn't decide to do that a little sooner?  No kidding.  Mitchell is glad her ordeal is over and she lived to tell the story.  So, I say to everybody, keep a hammer in your closet, tie your cell phone around your neck.  How about take the lock off your closet, you fucking cunt?  Right.  What are you afraid, the moths are going to sneak out?  The moths. 
[04:34:30]  Take a hammer and hit yourself over the head with a claw end.  Take a hammer to do what?  Build yourself an escape hatch?  You're already in there, you fucking idiot.  Always a lesson.  Take a hammer in your closet, tie your cell phone around your neck.  Tightly and then to a beam.  And be in shape.  And be in shape.  Keep a toaster in the closet and a photo of the Blues Brother and some bottled water.  Some bottles of water.  And some ST-37 to rub on your clit in case of an injury. 
[04:35:00]  In case of an injury.  And bring a little, and bring something to wash your clit with so the cats don't start  lapping at it.  She would wake up every five minutes and the cats would be lapping at her clit hood.  They thought it was a little fish hatchery.  Little salmon eggs under that fucking, that fleshy fold.  Delicious little treat hider.  Chester's Liver writes, does she live in a gingerbread house? 
[04:35:30]  She's an old diabetic, how brittle was the wall?  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  I will be an enemy.  Pam Babcock.  Everybody remember who she is?  Yeah.  Pam Babcock.  Aside from having a very funny name, she is the woman who spent nearly two years in  a bathroom sitting on the toilet.  So long, in fact, that her ass, much like a tree that grows around a signpost on the 
[04:36:00]  side of the road, grew around the toilet seat, and she had to be removed by paramedics with  the toilet seat.  And, well, there's an update on her.  Uh-oh.  She's still alive.  Uh-huh.  Still alive.  Her ass welded to a toilet seat, and she's still alive.  You better make that deal.  Sonny was hot for that septa tank, wasn't he?  Well, that's bad luck for you, and bad luck for me.  You know, peel her ass off that thing. 
[04:36:30]  By the way, I was in that line waiting for that bathroom.  That was in an Applebee's, right?  This fucking cunt.  Well, let's see.  Her, I guess, living boyfriend, Corey McFerrin, 37, has been charged with a misdemeanor count  of mistreatment of a dependent adult.  Uh-huh.  Is that a...  Wait a minute.  You can get in trouble for that?  Is she paralyzed?  Is there something wrong?  I mean, other than her ass screw to the seat.  The woman's aunt said she calls daily to the hospital to ask how Babcock's doing and asked 
[04:37:00]  to talk to her.  Babcock has agreed to talk to her only once for about 10 minutes, and she had to go take  a shit.  Haven't heard from her since.  It's been seven months.  During one call, Babcock spoke little and mostly listened to her aunt, recounted happy  family memories, like swimming, camping, and boating.  But every memory probably was like, yeah, do you remember that time we went to the Super 
[04:37:30]  Rage?  They had such a nice bathroom.  Yes.  What a great toilet.  What a great toilet.  That's what she talks about.  It had the old-fashioned toilet, the kind you can sit under for two years, like a tape  a far-side calendar behind it.  Behind it, with the old pull chain.  Happy family memory.  Remember she only took 11 days to shit?  Remember that?  We had a party for her?  What is she eating?  Spackle and fucking chicken quesadillas mixed? 
[04:38:00]  Twelve turkey wraps and a pound of Silly Putty.  Fucking veins are popping out of her head like a fucking...  Somebody fill in the blank.  I'm very tired right now.  Oh, God damn.  You got it, bro.  Ooh.  You can throw oatmeal in there if you want.  I know where you're going.  Babcock.  Egg whites will do it too, my friend.  That's right.  Protein.  You're right.  The local diner, the guy who would always send her food over, said, I knew there was  something wrong because she would always have grits and a brick on it. 
[04:38:30]  She's like the brick.  Sounds too much like grits.  Oh, my God.  She doesn't believe in fruit.  Her wounds are still very serious.  Her wounds?  Her wounds are still serious.  She's not out of the woods by any means.  She's a very sick girl.  Was she on a toilet for a month, really?  No, for years.  Two years.  Two years.  She sat on the toilet.  Nobody checked on her?  This guy must love her to death, huh?  Let's see.  McFerrin told authorities Babcock feared leaving the bathroom.  bathroom and may not have left it for two years, although he said he was unsure how 
[04:39:00]  long she was in there.  He said that he took her food and water daily.  He said that he repeatedly asked her to come out, but she usually replied saying, maybe tomorrow.  Imagine what the living room looks like.  Hello.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Come out of the shitter tomorrow.  How awful is that?  He wants to eat her pussy.  He's going to put his chin on the fucking, like, hang it halfway on the toilet seat. 
[04:39:30]  He hasn't had fucking anal sex in two years, this poor bastard.  Unless he could, like, fucking hit a big dick and he could squat on her and aim it down  and fish hook it up into her tookus.  Into her tookus.  Fish hook it into her tookus.  Right up into her rear.  Was it just a very comfortable toilet seat?  What the fuck's going on?  Is she disabled?  I don't get this at all.  They're not giving enough details.  People want the fucking, they don't want to know the story.  Yeah, it makes me wonder. 
[04:40:00]  How did her ass grow to the seat like that?  She'd have to sit there.  I can't get past what Nick's whole rant about it.  What the fucking blood vessels popping in her forehead.  She's sitting in there from February to November.  Oh, just straining her fucking hemorrhoids sound like bubble wrap popping.  They tell you, yeah, they tell you not to sit on a toilet too long after you take a dump  because that's what causes hemorrhoids, you know?  Yeah, your fucking shit will hang out.  Yeah, she's got, like, Napa Valley grapes hanging out of her ass. 
[04:40:30]  You banger.  It looks like melted mozzarella coming down into the fucking toilet bowl.  Hanging in there.  What was the mixture again?  Chicken quesadillas about it?  Yeah, fucking spackle and chicken quesadillas.  Fucking brunt.  That would give you a hurtin', man.  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine the fucking, it's just hilarious to me.  That really is some type of mental illness that the boyfriend was such an enabler.  That's terrific.  He must have loved her.  She was in there for two years.  He knocked twice. 
[04:41:00]  Yeah.  Where did he shit?  He shit in the kitchen sink with his cousin, Teddy.  The one way to get her off that seat, he should have just karate kicked her off and watched  her flesh rip and then laughed at her when she laid there by the kitty litter.  Like, get up, you lazy fucking psycho.  Like a pesky label that won't peel off of something.  It leaves a little on the seat.  Yeah, like an apple with a little fucking...  Comes off her ass.  Rip her off like a mattress tag.  You're embarrassing me in front of my friends.  Should have tied a chain around her neck and tied it to her back to a dump truck and 
[04:41:30]  just pulled her out.  Toilet and all.  Dragged her across the street.  Still stuck to her fucking ass.  Let the neighbors get a good look.  This is true.  You know what's ironic?  Gurney.  It happened in Gurney.  It was in Gurney.  Right here in Gurney.  What a lying cock sucking town.  In Gurney.  She couldn't shit right here in Gurney.  How great would a fire have been in that place if she's just in the bathroom begging  for help?  Where?  Shit or get off the...  Well, you know.  Shit or grow to the pot.  Oh my God.  He could have at least gone in there once a week with a spatula. 
[04:42:00]  I know.  And just like flipped her a little bit.  Her name is Pam.  You think she wouldn't have gotten stuck?  Yeah.  They need a no stick Teflon toilet seat.  Jesus.  Fucking Christ.  It's the worst of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Microsoft internal promo videos?  What's this about?  Well, you know how sometimes companies, to like boost morale, they'll produce and release  some kind of video for all the employees to get psyched about.  And they never do.  No. 
[04:42:30]  It never works.  And they're always douche chilly and cringe worthy.  And I got...  Two of them are from Microsoft.  One's really, really old.  It's from when they just released like 386.  All right.  And they were trying to show you all the capabilities it could do.  What's 386?  The old school, like old school Windows like 3.1.  I think it was before 3.1 actually.  It was like DOS version of Windows.  It was terrible.  And the other one is from the new service pack for Vista, which just hit like this weekend.  And the video is so atrociously terrible that Microsoft actually had to like put out a comment 
[04:43:00]  and say like, oh, we did it purposely to be campy like that.  But you just know they didn't.  They got called out.  Yeah.  We were goofing.  It's no goof.  It's a little joke.  It's no goof.  They don't know how to joke.  Can we see it?  Yeah.  The actual video.  But here's the audio for the Microsoft 386 internal promo video.  And this thing is like 15 minutes long, too.  And this is just a small part.  Don't worry.  We're not doing the whole thing.  We got a little taste for everybody.  Bill Gates said, what did he say?  This is the only computer you'll ever need? 
[04:43:30]  No.  Bill Gates had a quote from a long time ago, like early 80s, where he said like something  like 256 KB was the most memory anybody would ever need.  Would ever need.  He's right.  That's all I have.  I have a document stored on my computer.  A document.  That's right.  It's a laundry list.  Plan on upgrading.  How much does 256 KB?  It's nothing.  Oh, my God.  It's barely a picture.  It's not even a picture these days.  Come on.  Really?  256 K?  Everything's at least megs. 
[04:44:00]  Wow.  At this point.  And he really said that back in the day?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could you store like...  So he didn't see the capability of the computer, really.  I don't think anybody really knew what kind of capacity it was going to be used for.  Most of your pictures that you take are at least a meg or so.  If not more, I mean more.  More.  Yeah.  Like Eric's camera, he takes those big high-res.  High-def and high-res.  Each one's like 20 megs.  And that's like 250 K.  You need 1,000 K just to make one meg.  So...  So you're getting like a quarter of a megabyte. 
[04:44:30]  Fair enough.  I remember my buddy Joe, he's a comedian, and I remember we were at Dangerfields one night,  and he was saying, I updated my computer, and I have a gigabyte of memory.  Like, he had added to his hard drive, and I was like, a gigabyte?  Like, I knew a little about computers, and I'm like, that sounds like a lot.  We had a gig of hard drive space, not RAM.  Not RAM.  Okay.  Hard drive space.  Yeah.  And we couldn't, like, gigabyte? 
[04:45:00]  Like, it just sounded like...  Yeah, that was ridiculous.  Yeah.  I remember that guy, the sound guy over at AAF.  He said, when he was running Pro Tools...  Oh, shit, yeah.  ...to do all the sound, he goes, dude, I just got a hard drive.  And it was a couple of hard drives.  He goes, it equals a gig.  Wow.  And I was like, get the fuck out of here, a gigabyte!  No, that's nothing.  Well, listen to this awful rap.  Just a taste of this promotional video from the late 80s, mid-80s?  Do we know about it?  Yeah, this has to be, like, 1984 or 5. 
[04:45:30]  All right, mid.  Let's call it mid.  Uh-oh.  These are 1-2-3 files.  That doesn't look like 1-2-3.  It's na-na-na.  1-2-2-2-3.  But don't worry, William, just ham the dick to me.  I've got several applications.  Looking mighty slick.  Running under windows.  3-8-6 in one of the windows.  I've got 1-2-2-2-3 running at the same time as the others.  Can't you see?  I can cut and paste your files into my report. 
[04:46:00]  Or I can make them look better with Microsoft chalk.  Choices, choices, choices.  What I got now, I'm gonna show you how to make this thing look hot.  Up in accounting, nothing ever looks hot.  Good music, though, yeah.  Stand back, William, stand back, back, back.  Windows 3-8-6 is on the attack.  On the attack, huh?  Someday we'll be using these to download kiddie porn. 
[04:46:30]  Watch the little lad cry and scream and yell  while I trade pornography on LimeWire.  That is awful.  Let's say hi to Keith in Jersey.  Hey, Keith, what's up?  What's up, all right?  Hey, Keith.  Hey, Jimmy, this is the Mac consultant.  You had asked to call a couple weeks ago.  We talked to him.  Oh.  But Bill Gates' original quote back then was 640K.  Bought to be enough for anybody. 
[04:47:00]  Wow.  Wow.  640.  That was close.  He might have missed the mark a bit there, huh?  Fuck yeah.  I got a computer at 2 gigs.  I mean...  2 gigs!  That's right.  I have shit videos on it.  Hey, Jim, did you get all your Mac stuff worked out?  Yeah, I got a lot of it worked out.  It seems like a lot of the updates help.  Thanks, man.  I'm not 100%, but I'm getting there.  Yeah.  But thank you, bro.  All right.  I'm a scat away, so if you ever need any Mac help...  All right.  Thanks, man.  I'm going to take my number offline.  All right.  I'll fucking...  Maybe we'll meet in the fucking rest area, and you can show me through a hole in the 
[04:47:30]  stall.  Two men just talking Mac.  Sucking each other's cocks.  All right, brother.  Thanks, man.  That's right.  Nothing wrong with that.  Hey, I'm having a problem.  Let's...  Good.  So they don't have an...  Well, they do have an excuse for that one, because it's kind of dated.  It's really old.  But you're telling me the next one is from very recent?  Yeah, this is like from...  Last year or whatever?  Last year.  Over the weekend.  A few months ago?  Over the weekend.  Oh, it just came out?  Yeah, that's why it's floating around YouTube now.  Okay.  So it's pretty hot.  So this...  Because Microsoft just came out with like SP1 for Vista, which is like the service pack 
[04:48:00]  to plug holes and stuff.  And this was so bad, they actually had to make a statement saying we were just kind  of...  Yeah, they said, oh, no, you know, we knew it was campy.  We knew it was awful.  That was the point.  And they hired a Bruce Springsteen.  Sounded like Ben.  Yeah.  Like the whole concept is like it's supposed to be like the Born to Run video.  It sounds like the Pisswasser.  A little bit.  It's a commercial.  This operating system was born to suck windows.  Last year, when Vista was new, you sold the optimized desktop value. 
[04:48:30]  That's a pitch that never fails.  You saw lots of sales, but some enterprises said, wait and see, we don't want to adopt early.  Well, that's over because of SP1 and Larry Coates' love. 
[04:49:00]  If they have been waiting, no more hesitating.  They're singing about patching their fucks.  I know.  That's bizarre.  That's exactly what they're talking about.  You fucked up.  We fucked up.  There it is, in song.  Da-da-da.  When they see the improvements, the insecurity.  That's right.  The desktop and mobility. 
[04:49:30]  We've installed meat spin on your desktop.  They'll say this.  Gotta get me some.  Gotta get me some.  So I could get to masturbation.  She hasn't even reached menstruation.  Oh, they're redoing Dancing in the Dark. 
[04:50:00]  The video's Dancing in the Dark.  Oh, did I get that wrong?  Yeah.  Diagnostic and recovery to set him in.  This is so bad.  This is horrendous.  Yeah, they're goofing on Dancing in the Dark.  The video.  What's the point of this?  I don't know.  Like, what do they do?  They have too much money.  It was supposed to psych up their...  They have too much money and they have to, like...  And it's, like, well-made and, like, produced and everything.  This was, like, supposed to, like, hype up their sales force. 
[04:50:30]  Like, every computer doesn't come with fucking Vista in the first place.  Yeah.  Like, who are they selling it to is my question.  And I love how they have to title their service pack, like, service pack one because they  already foresee more bullshit down the road.  Yeah.  Right, right.  SP-1.  That's right.  Then there'll be more to come.  We know this operating system sucks dick, but we got to fix it.  Oh, they stink.  Might as well get rid of the Wendy's training video today. 
[04:51:00]  Yeah, these all kind of fit in the same bucket.  Same shitty category.  Same shit bucket.  But that is how much Windows money Microsoft has.  It's like, they're like, all right, we got to make a little video to kind of tell the  employees, buy the rights for Dancing with the Dark.  Yeah, yeah.  Or In the Dark.  Whichever one you can get your hands on.  Dancing with the Dark is no good.  That's a Heidi Klum's theme song.  Nice.  Where Dad doesn't welcome you back home from prom. 
[04:51:30]  What's the Wendy's video all about?  Well, I guess when you decide that you're going to start your career at Wendy's, they  give you an instructional video to watch to show you how to mop the floor and how to  make the burgers and when to flip them.  Show Dave Thomas grabbing his chest and falling to the floor from eating it.  And then our Bud Dwyer in a Wendy's hat, which is what you want to be doing if you're  fucking starting a career there.  If you want to work your way up to fucking district manager, just fucking pull a pistol  out of a bag and shoot yourself in a fucking... 
[04:52:00]  All right, let's take a listen to this.  Oh, man.  Yeah, they're all very musical.  Try and hook the youngsters.  Now, work in the grill, Bill.  It ain't so tough.  But first of all, you got to check your stuff.  Like a grill that said 250.  With the meat and cheese, that's ready to go.  Yeah.  A towel to keep your station looking cool.  This can't be an instructional video. 
[04:52:30]  These are so real.  And you would have no...  You have no idea how many companies actually give...  Oh, burgers.  Yeah.  Oh, burgers are bigger.  It's better when it's cooked, man.  Yes.  That's right.  What the hell?  Work here till you get...  All right.  Oh, no, I had it.  Oh, did you?  Oh, shit.  Okay.  Sickle self.  Yeah, okay, okay.  Sorry, Jimmy.  It's all right. 
[04:53:00]  Your station looking cool.  But most of all, you got to have your tool.  Tool.  Nice guitar work.  Are you with me now?  No.  Get ready.  We're going to lay them down.  Now, beats got grain to it just like wood.  You got to follow the arrow to lay it down like you should.  From the front to the back, you got to lay it down.  Face it evenly, not scattered around.  Next, you get the talk to me.  I hope this guy got the shit beat out of him in the hood when he got back home.  Hey, guys, I did a motherfucking Wendy's commercial and shit. 
[04:53:30]  I did an instruction video.  It's still better than the Sugarhill Gang.  This is way better than Rapper's Delight ever was.  Was he saying meat's got a grain to it and you got to lay it down the right way or else  it sucks?  I guess if you cook it wrong, it tastes horrible.  Yeah.  He's fucking dealing with idiot employees.  He's trying to, he had to show them where the arrow was.  Yeah.  You have to go the direction of the arrows.  Direction of the arrows.  You retard.  Look at this guy.  Next, you got to soften the meat from the back to the front to make the taste complete.  Not too little, not too much.  With a little finesse, you'll get the touch. 
[04:54:00]  What's coming up next is our key to success.  We'll turn the meat and do a 400 press.  Don't wait too long, I emphasize, or the meat won't reach the proper side.  When things start to sizzle, you're ready to go.  Generally turn the meat, but don't be slow.  Just turn them over easily.  We don't want a broken patty, that's a guarantee.  Press out the corners, one, two, three, four.  Rock of the bitch, all you keep in store.  Top and bottom, left and right.  And you'll get a patty that's out of sight.  Press out the corners, nice and wide, at least half an inch on both sides. 
[04:54:30]  Yeah.  And here's something you want to avoid, you big-tongued fucking silly-head mongoloid.  Now, you've got to do your work, and you've got to do it good.  You should have been left in the dumpster behind Planned Parenthood.  And you've got to work fast, and you've got to work hard, 
[04:55:00]  because after all, you're just a big-tongued retard.  Oh, my God.  When you're done with work, you can go home,  even though you're lacking a chromosome.  Or, when you're done with work, you can go home,  even though they hate looking at you, because you've got Down syndrome.  That's a lot of words to show.  What the fuck?  We're on the cuff here.  I know, I'm acting like this is a real song. 
[04:55:30]  I act like I'm creating with Prince.  Danny, go find Don't Copy That Flappy.  Another rap song called Don't Copy That Flappy.  All right.  What happened?  Now this doesn't want to work?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, that's not right.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Now, what do we do?  Oh, no.  What do we do now?  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Look down!  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[04:56:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  On both sides.  Mm-hmm.  The reason you press, you gotta think.  When the meat hits the grill, it starts to shrink.  We start shrinking.  When we hit that grill, you know it will  When we hit that grill, you know it will  When you see red juices on the top of the meat  It's time to give the turn and press a repeat  Do it again just like you did before  Do the four-corner press just one time more 
[04:56:30]  It's complicated  Now once you press this a second time  Don't press them again because the meat's just fine  But when you see red juices rise  Turn the patty over to the other side  Don't spray the grill, we want it wet, you see  And keep the meat moist so it's hot and juicy  When the meat's red, juice no longer arrives  You can serve that patty, it'll win a prize  It takes about four minutes to cook  Now just make sure you can have a look  Use your tool and double check  It should be gray and moist to be correct 
[04:57:00]  And order this place, you're ready to go  Drain the meat just like so  Once the draining is totally done  Place the patty squarely on the hill of that bun  Now there you go, Billy, you  Yeah  Don't be afraid, I think you're gonna be  Yeah  I'm just asking  If a cop comes and orders this shit  Top it off with a gob of spit  You know, because black people don't like cops  They spit on their food  That's funny  You got the laugh, you didn't have to explain  I felt I had to explain  They were laughing 
[04:57:30]  I had no confidence  They were laughing  I was explaining it before the punchline  Don't listen to the blue-eyed devil's lies  Fuck Wendy's, go to Popeye's  Yeah, just reaching  Anything racist, just reaching  That's right  We got Mike in Florida  Mike, you watched this video as a former employee of Wendy's?  Yeah, that was about 18 years ago  That brought back some really bad memories  Ooh, what the fuck is that picture?  I'm sorry  Yeah, what are you looking at, man? 
[04:58:00]  You just distracted the whole show  She had a little schoolgirl skirt on  I love the way it's open  Open legs  Mike, so it just brings back memories  And you figured you should call  Go  And I realize  You're sitting there watching that video  And you realize what a mistake you've made  Yeah, I mean, you couldn't be looking forward to your career  You know that in a law office  They're not showing you what's the equivalent of a literacy test  You know  And you gotta pick up the pencil  And give them to the boss  And look in  It's a death penalty case 
[04:58:30]  And it can't be lost  It's always some stupid fucking lame-ass job that you got  That they have to fucking sing it to you so you remember  Brilliant  What were the words?  The four corners?  I gotta push down  And don't be a clown?  What?  And don't ever frown  Mike, what did you do with your life?  You started by watching that video at Wendy's  Now what?  I'm a FedEx courier now  So you got a good gig  There you go  Step up in the right direction 
[04:59:00]  Right on, man  Alright, thanks for listening  Alright  Bye-bye  Hey, it's Mike Rowe  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony  Which means the best  Opie and Anthony  It's degrading  That is just horrific  It's a freak show  Just let this show die then  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show  They should be shot  I think we can squeeze one more of these weird stories in  They've been piling up around here lately  It's lunchtime in one of Haiti's most desperate slums  But because of rising food prices 
[04:59:30]  Called Haiti  That sounds like an ad  It's lunchtime in one of Haiti's most desperate slums  Sonny D time  I think they're going to be eating leavings  Leavings  Sonny D in Haiti  They open the refrigerator  And it's just five people with bloody machetes  Looking at a rump roast or something  Let's say hi to Mike in Arkansas  Mike  Hey guys  Hey  Hey Jimmy  How much do hooker leavings cost? 
[05:00:00]  Leavings  Depends on the gal  Depends on the freshness  It's lunchtime in one of Haiti's most desperate slums  But because of rising food prices  Some of the poorest can't even afford a daily plate of rice  Instead they're taking desperate measures to fill their bellies  This mother and her toddler now rely on a traditional Haitian remedy for hunger pangs  Cookies made of dried yellow dirt  The crowd loved that 
[05:00:30]  By the way  I'm not getting in trouble for playing that boring clip over  Why would you?  All right  It was God wanted that played  It's a commercial here  I think it's a commercial that we're playing here in New York  Where Mike from Mike and the Mad Dog  Is talking about the Super Bowl  I guess he's doing a little Super Bowl like tidbits or something  I don't even know  But his delivery is like  I don't want to do this  I'm being forced to do this  So here it is  He's going to pizzazz that guy 
[05:01:00]  I've been playing like the boring clip under his commercial read  What happened with the dirt cookies?  They sound lovely  Yeah  It's like yellow cookies made from dirt  Yeah  For hunger pangs  Cookies made of dried yellow dirt  The mud has long been used by pregnant women and children  As an antacid and source of calcium  But now cookies made of dirt, salt and vegetable shortening  Have become a regular meal for some  Food prices are up as much as 40% on some Caribbean islands  After floods from last year's hurricane season damaged crops 
[05:01:30]  Because of that, Caribbean leaders held an emergency summit  To discuss cutting food taxes  And coming up with ways to reduce the island's dependence on imports  Patient doctors say those who rely on the cookies are at risk for malnutrition  And officials warn the dirt can contain deadly parasites or toxins  This story reminds me  That's why I had to jump in  I was out for sushi the other night  And the rice wasn't as gummy as I like it to be  So my sushi fell apart 
[05:02:00]  That's right  Did you send it back and have it thrown into a garbage pail?  I certainly did  I said throw this away  No one will want this  That story reminded me of  It's worthless  They're eating dirt cookies  How awful  Don't call them cookies  No, they're not cookies  It's dirt  It reminds me of  And this is true  I took my daughter to dinner the other night  And I ordered her a plate of spaghetti and a cheeseburger  Wow  In case  Because she's fickle  She doesn't know which one she wants  I understand that 
[05:02:30]  A bite of each  If we're going to talk about food  Can we play We Are The World or something?  We need some music behind this  She took a bite of burger  A bite of the pasta  And the rest we just chucked in the gut  Throw it away  For the rats  The rats eat better than  Yeah, exactly  Than the Haitians in this city  I bet you the dirt cookies have some  Leavings chips in them  Leavings  Sure they do  Leavings  I gave my dog  I fed my dog fresh beef and vegetables for breakfast this morning  That's true  Fresh beef from a supermarket 
[05:03:00]  I went to an Italian restaurant here in Manhattan  And it's served what they call family style  Ah yeah  And it's a giant  You get a giant platter of food  And it's just me and my girl  And she doesn't like what I have  And I don't like what she has  So we each had to get a giant, giant portion  Sure  Of which you couldn't even tell we had eaten anything out of it  And I was stuffed  Right 
[05:03:30]  And then they take it away and throw it in the garbage  Yeah, no, and you throw it in like hazmat garbage  So it's certain that no other people will eat it  Right  It's like a shredder for food  Yeah, because it's illegal to give that food to anybody  And the beauty, because we are Americans  All that beautiful food that's in the dumpsters  We don't let the homeless eat it  So we poison it  They dump actual poison on this delicious food  That the homeless would have grabbed and had a nice meal  Exactly  We do that because we're Americans  That's what we've always done  Jimmy, you got a food story maybe? 
[05:04:00]  Well, I started with the sushi one  I normally, I don't know  I mean, I like to take a couple of bites out of things  And throw it on the floor  And they just say, look, this fell  I'm not paying for it  And then I go home  It fell  What about the gluttony Super Bowl Sunday?  You know, big game on Sunday  The gluttony that's going to be  A lot of chicken wings  Yep, I'll order a pizza  Well, a few, about a week ago  I was driving from Louisville, Kentucky  To Knoxville, Tennessee  And I stopped at a Kroger's  Right  At 3 o'clock in the morning  And it was open 
[05:04:30]  Totally lit up and air-conditioned  And perfectly, you know, controlled  And there was just about an acre of meat  Out on the, you know, on the shelf  Yeah  And no one was going to ever buy it that night  And the next day it would all be thrown away  Yeah, of course  And that Kroger's represents  Literally millions of supermarkets  That just have  In case one guy wants meat at 3 o'clock  And wants a square inch of meat 
[05:05:00]  They put an acre out there  Yeah, it really sucks  They've got to eat dirt cookies  And then it all throws  Oh, right  Dirt cookies  I forgot about the dirt cookies  Why are they eating dirt cookies?  There's meat at Kroger's  And if you want to  Go back a ways  I remember  How far is Haiti from Louisville, really?  How hard would that be?  Come on  Just make the swim  When I was probably a little older than these children  That they're talking about  That are making dirt cookies  I remember going to Jack in the Box 
[05:05:30]  With all my friends  At the end of a night of drinking  And we would get breakfast jacks  They were called  Right  But we would get extra ones  Yeah  Just so after we eat our fill  We could drive by the Jack in the Box  And throw them at the big windows in front  And just watch them slide down the window  And would we laugh  As that food  That sustenance  Was just oozing down the windows  We have enough food here  In this country  To do funny things with it 
[05:06:00]  Yeah  Yeah  We play with  We have to be told  Not to play with our food  Exactly  That dirt cookie story reminded me  I had a Toll House  Freshly baked  I had about eight of them  And I was only going to eat three  And a couple of them  Actually had more chips  On one side of the cookie  Than the other  That's awful  Infuriating  That's awful  Hold on  I want to make more room  So I can eat  Yeah  Yeah  How do they deal with the anorexia problem  Over there  Like  Do they have to 
[05:06:30]  Maybe force them to eat the dirt cookies  And the bulimia  Like does that hurt  When  After you  Binge  On dirt cookies  You have to purge  And there's the pebbles  That scrape  Look at the positive side  They don't have those diseases  In Haiti  That's right  That was  I bought  I went shopping the other night  For my kids  And I got a chicken  And some lamb chops  And beef  And then I ended up  Not feeling like cooking  Yeah  I got take out  Every night 
[05:07:00]  This week  And all of that food  Went rotten  And in my fridge  Yep  You just gotta clean it out  And throw it away  Or else the fridge stinks  I know it's a real drag for me  It's molds  Yeah  Everyone understands  And what we're really trying to say  With this bit  And don't misinterpret it  Is that  This Black History Month  We want to acknowledge  That in Haiti  They are spoiled  They're what?  Spoiled  They're spoiled  Excuse me  Have a dirt cookie  I'd love to have cookies  For every meal of the day  Sure  Listen  It's not just dirt too  What did she say 
[05:07:30]  They had a vegetable shortening  And salt in there  It's delicious  Sounds great  Have a dirt cookie son  You've been good  In some countries  That's a delicacy  You know when they say that  Exactly  In some countries  It's a delicacy  Yeah because they don't have  Any actual food  Because they don't have beef  Figure it out  Poor countries  Spit is a delicacy  Yeah that's why slugs  Are a delicacy  They spit in each other's mouths  For food  Because they got nothing else  How about  I remember being a small child  And my parents  Getting into a big fight  And my father 
[05:08:00]  Taking a full plate  A big platter of spaghetti  And just throwing it  Against the wall  And calling my mother  An F and a C  And watching the spaghetti  It was down the wall  And it brought tears to my eyes  Not you know  The waste of food  It was the fact that  My parents were probably  Getting a divorce  And I was devastated  Well the people in Haiti  Would probably happily  Drink those tears  For nourishment  Well add it to these  Dirt cookies  That's where the salt  Comes from 
[05:08:30]  Their own tears  Wonderful snack  Wonderful  Oh look  An infected toe  Let me suck on that  I'm thirsty  I'm thirsty  I have personally  I have probably personally  Poured  About 4 million gallons  Of milk down the drain  Just poured it down the drain  Enough to feed a nation  Bought a gallon of milk  This has been repeated  50,000 times in my life  Bought a gallon of milk  Made a 
[05:09:00]  Didn't even drink a glass of it  Made a cappuccino  With an eighth of a cup of it  And then let the rest rot  Come back home from the road  And pour it out  Right  How about lunch meat  Lunch meat  Oh yeah  We all get like a pound of ham  Or turkey or something  Give me a pound  You know what  Give me a pound buddy  You make one sandwich  And forget that  It's in the fridge  And then  Right to the garbage  That's it  Swiss cheese becomes cardboard  Stiffens up  Exactly  Teach a man to buy cookies 
[05:09:30]  Boy I screwed up  I've never actually read the Bible  But I just heard it's good  Oh wow  It sucks  Yeah  Hello  Hello  Yeah we were doing  Hello  No that's the thing  Give a nation  Grain and food  And rice  And they'll eat for  20, 30 years  Yeah  Teach them that the dirt  Beneath their feet  Can be cookies  And the whole country  Will be dead in a week  Hey this is Sean William Scott  You're listening to  The worst of Opie and Anthony  This concludes
