<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a nonsensical, humorous fictional story about a deadly virus, followed by the hosts' (Opie, Anthony, and James Norton) critique of their own underwhelming second-anniversary show. They blamed the presence of XM executives for stifling their usual style, though they acknowledged Kevin Smith's call-in as a positive highlight.  The conversation then shifted to their potential TV and film careers, including possible collaborations with Ron Howard, and their recent TV commercial featuring Anthony's tongue twister and a news report about a cocaine energy drink.  A significant segment involved listener calls suggesting various jobs for Opie to try for a day, ranging from window washing to working with a medical examiner, including suggestions like an MTA track worker and a dentist at Rikers Island.  The show concluded this portion with a scathing review of Metallica's new ringtones, followed by a description and photos (posted on their website) of a midget with unusually shaped arms seen outside the studio.

Comedian Frank Caliendo joined the show in studio.  The hosts mocked listener complaints about their humor targeting midgets, overweight women, and people with intellectual disabilities, then discussed their "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, aiming to find even heavier contestants than the current leader at 430 pounds.  Caliendo's impressions, especially his John Madden one, were discussed, along with a story about Madden disliking Caliendo's *Mad TV* impressions.  The conversation meandered through topics like serial killers, angry listener calls ("You Suck"), and their attempt to manipulate *Dancing with the Stars* voting for Jerry Springer.  They also heavily mocked their staff member Kenny with derogatory physical descriptions. Matthew Modine then joined the show.  The conversation turned to Modine's experiences filming *Full Metal Jacket*, including anecdotes about Stanley Kubrick's directing style, R. Lee Ermey's performance, and the brutal filming conditions, particularly the repeated slapping of Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio by Ermey during a scene.  Modine discussed his new film, *Kettle of Fish*, and the hosts continued their offensive humor and banter.

The conversation with Modine continued, focusing on the *Full Metal Jacket* slapping scene and the on-set tension between Modine and D'Onofrio.  Frank Caliendo remained in the studio, preparing for a *Late Show with David Letterman* appearance, and the hosts promoted Modine's book, *Full Metal Diary*. A listener praised their interviewing style.  A listener-submitted parody of Dateline NBC's "To Catch a Predator" segments, focusing on cookies, was played.  The show later featured clips of a deaf Chicago news reporter, Karen Meyer, covering a beauty program for girls with spinal cord injuries, which the hosts found highly unusual and comedic.  The "walkover" segment showcased a man gifting the hosts pornography.  The show wrapped up with more banter, comedic commentary, and listener interaction.

Dax Shepard joined the show promoting *Employee of the Month*.  The conversation covered various tangents, including Shepard's experiences on *Punk'd* (including a failed prank on Busta Rhymes with Britney Spears and a near encounter with Mike Tyson), his views on Liza Minnelli, and a graphic discussion about fisting. He also discussed his appearance on the *Today Show*, encountering Christopher Cross and Liza Minnelli.  The show included sexually explicit and offensive jokes and listeners' calls, one criticizing Opie's pronunciation and another declaring Anthony "hotter" than Opie.  The show concluded with a discussion of a *Ron and Fez* sweeper and a detailed recounting of comedian James Inman being heckled, escalating into an offensive argument between the hosts and a caller.

A significant portion of the show featured a discussion with comedian Jimmy Norton about handling hecklers, particularly the use of the word "cunt" and resulting confrontations, with Norton recounting incidents and advocating for aggressive responses.  Frank Caliendo was again in the studio, discussing his experiences on different radio shows, contrasting Opie and Anthony's collaborative style with others.  He mentioned a fan recognizing him at Circuit City.  The segment concluded with a James Taylor-style parody of DMX's "Up In Here" by Brother Joe, and the hosts briefly compared the broadcast to other shows, concluding that this segment was "probably worse."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  This was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease,  fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates, and kills as fast these numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. 
[00:00:30]  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  Such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and coworkers.  Sometimes it leaves puffed fuels.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God Almighty.  We've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is its fabric?  All over the place.  All right. 
[00:01:00]  We're coming out.  Here we go.  I'm a boredom.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  James Norton.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  All right.  Morning. 
[00:01:30]  Good morning.  Morning.  Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning, morning.  This is great iced tea.  Yeah.  This is great iced tea.  Yeah.  Let's get that out of the hamper.  Stretch.  One.  Two.  Stretch.  One.  Two.  We start the show with calisthenics every morning.  It's 1955.  Thank God that anniversary crap is over with.  That's enough.  Good morning.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Back to normal today.  I got to be honest with you, man.  I hated yesterday.  I just hated yesterday's show.  So did I.  I couldn't eat.  Hated it.  The wonderfulness.  It was our second year anniversary back on radio.  Everyone said it wouldn't last.  So we took time to kind of take a look back and reflect a little bit.  And it just stunk. 
[00:02:30]  I just wish we would.  Those anniversary shows always.  Well, this is what I say.  No more anniversary shows.  No.  Unless it's a biggie.  Like five years.  The ones.  The five.  Even the fifteens kind of suck.  Yeah.  One, five, ten.  One, five, ten.  Twenty.  Fifty.  Hundred.  That's it.  After the hundred year anniversary of this show, we do no more anniversary shows.  We could have done Mark Foley audio yesterday.  Or transcripts.  Wow.  Instead we get. 
[00:03:00]  Instead we get two of the big bosses from XM sitting in here assuming that we could do good radio with them.  Ugh.  Put them in here.  Oh, I like the guys.  And they appreciate us and we appreciate what they've done for us.  Blah, blah, blah.  But as far as getting together to do a little radio together.  Ugh.  Yeah.  And then they're the big bosses so you kind of.  We were hinting the whole time like you might want to leave.  You said what you had to say and now we got to like, you know, do our radio show for, I don't know, ten billion people. 
[00:03:30]  We should have told them that they were on the air during commercial breaks.  That would have been good.  Yeah.  They're just comfortably sitting around thinking this is making for great radio for people.  Cheap chat.  And then they're just turning it into one big commercial and we're like, oh my god.  That's their jobs.  Oh my god.  No one cares.  That's what they do.  No one cares.  Just let us do the heavy lifting.  It's all they do. 
[00:04:00]  So anyway.  Reset your camera there, Iraq.  That stinks, that pixelated mess.  Unless that's the way you look today.  What happened?  Pixelated.  What happened?  Pal Talk.  Oh, the cameras are all messed up?  One of them was a little pixelated.  Sometimes we got to reboot.  Yeah, we're all about the technology here.  We love letting you take a little peeks, peeksy on what's going on.  Hey, look.  Jimmy's going to the bathroom.  You know?  And you get to see it.  Hey, look.  The boss is boring the audience. 
[00:04:30]  I'll turn the camera so they can see it.  Sure.  You just don't know what to do with those anniversary shows.  It's just like, ugh.  And it's only two years.  Hi, guys.  Just calling up to say congratulations.  Oh, yeah.  Thrilling.  The only thrill yesterday really was Kevin Smith calling in.  Yeah, that was great.  That's always good.  Well, he called to say happy anniversary, but then we got some real radio out of him. 
[00:05:00]  We talk about other stuff.  The happy anniversary thing lasted three seconds, and then we talked about him reviewing movies  on Ebert and Roper.  They have him as a replacement for Ebert every so often, but they're having him more often  than other people because he does such a damn good job.  And what movie does he want us all to see?  Oh, that's...  Departed.  Departed, right?  Departed, I hear, is unbelievable.  Yeah.  And he just gave it a great review.  He got like four stars in the paper today or something like that, three and a half stars.  Supposed to be another friggin' classic, man. 
[00:05:30]  Gotta love those movies.  So.  Yeah.  I kind of like the Kevin Smith friendship thing.  Slowly develop.  It's nice.  Yeah, I see a movie.  That's someone you want in your camp.  I see a movie in our future.  I see a movie in our future.  Yeah.  You pay the money, we sit down and watch it.  It's about the movie we're going to be in.  It's so stupid.  When you make friends with some of these bigwigs in Hollywood, your mind just goes crazy at  night.  Well, what about your new friend, Ron Howard? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, I'm thinking I'm going to get the phone call any day.  I saw a picture of him in the paper at the Mets game.  I was at the Mets game.  Ron Howard was at the Mets game.  Were you sharing like, wow, look at that, that was nice.  No, I don't even know where he was sitting.  Oh, I thought maybe you were next to each other.  No, I was down the first baseline.  I want to say hi to everybody I met at the Mets game.  Holy crap, I think people are watching TV and seeing us on TV with that TV commercial.  I've kind of been noticing that.  Oh my God.  Oof.  That commercial's all over the place.  Oh my God. 
[00:06:30]  I thought this morning again, me and I were like, all right, enough about the dress.  Enough about the dress.  Enough about the fat broad.  Yeah, our TV commercial's up on YouTube.  As well as Big A doing a tongue twister.  Yeah, I saw some of that.  That's tragic.  It was pretty funny, right?  Tragic comedy.  And also Big A doing a news story on that cocaine energy drink.  Yeah.  And the cocaine energy drink people are so happy with it, they threw it on their website.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, Big A talking about their energy drink.  Right. 
[00:07:00]  So, more friends.  No, Elo got an email from Ron Howard.  And Ron Howard said it was a pleasure meeting Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  Are you kidding me?  So, I'm starting to think, uh, I'm starting to think things.  You better stop thinking things, Opie Norton.  Let your imagination get carried away with you, that you're dating starlets.  Let's be honest with each other, all of us in this room.  We're all hoping that we're the breakout star.  We're all hoping we get that one call that just allows us to leave this. 
[00:07:30]  Do you know something?  Listen, I am so completely content with my job here.  I don't care if we go further in this or not.  As far as the radio end of it goes, I want to take that to the limit.  That's like what I, take it to the limit.  That's what I want to do.  Yeah.  But TV, movies, crap like that, I really, it's not one of those big priorities.  If a project comes along and it's right, that's fine. 
[00:08:00]  But this is it for me.  This is all I want to do.  And I don't even want to do it this goddamn early.  Oh, my God.  But this is, I enjoy doing radio.  It's great.  Anthony and I have been doing this together for 12 years.  Before that, before that, I did it for another 10 years.  Yeah.  I am so ready to get that phone call to try something new. 
[00:08:30]  Well, perhaps if I was spinning records for the 10 years prior, I would feel the same way.  Not all 10 years.  Not all 10 years.  Well, a lot of it.  I got my chuckles in.  Yeah, but.  I got my chuckles in a different way.  It wasn't the show that you know and love today, but.  Yeah, it wasn't what we're doing here.  I'm just.  I was always going.  Just digging on what we're doing.  I was always going for the laugh and always trying to, you know, be a little different  in the radio world.  Oh, I'm so ready for that phone call, though.  So ready.  I just want to try something new. 
[00:09:00]  Like.  I don't know.  Someday it's just going to make sense to try something new.  I'm serious.  Maybe Ron Howard.  I've been doing this since I was 18.  Maybe Ron Howard will call.  Do you realize I've done radio and I was a caddy and I worked in a video store?  That's it.  That's it, huh?  That is all I've done in my entire life.  Eek.  I was a caddy from 12.  Yeah, a caddy.  Winning that caddy tournament is important.  I was a caddy from 12 years old to 24 years old. 
[00:09:30]  I worked in a video store when I went to college in Geneseo.  And I got fired because I was watching porno because I was bored.  Of course.  And then the radio.  That's it.  That's all I've done.  That's all I've done.  People are saying you could be a stand-in for Owen Wilson or Ellen DeGeneres.  That's not very nice.  Kevin from Connecticut.  I got to break my nose to look like Owen Wilson. 
[00:10:00]  A lot of people think I look like Owen Wilson,  but I think I got to smash up my nose to make it a little more accurate.  That Schween nose that he's got.  The Mets looked great yesterday, although they wobbled to the finish.  Let's go, Mets go.  Everybody was on the edge of their seat at Shea Stadium.  Were they?  Oh, my God.  And I got to tell you, what a nightmare going to Shea Stadium.  What a complete nightmare because they've already broke ground on the new stadium for Shea.  Yeah.  So they pretty much have taken away, my estimate, about 60% of the parking. 
[00:10:30]  So you can't drive to a Mets game anymore.  No, you've got to take the subway.  You just can't do it.  And they just pack them in like sardines.  Have you ever been on a train and you just feel the sweat kind of dripping down your back?  You're kidding, right?  Huh?  I said you're kidding, right?  Oh, I forgot you don't live in the real world anymore.  You should try it sometime.  The real world?  It's kind of cool out there still.  I live in real suburbia.  That's the real world I live in.  Suburbia.  I'm not an urbanite. 
[00:11:00]  I don't like the urban lifestyle.  I like suburbia.  Yeah.  Where we drive our own vehicles, roll the windows up, and yell racial epithets at people that can't hear us.  That's suburbia.  Not being with them in a sweaty subway car.  I took the 7 train.  That was the train that John Rocker had a problem with back in the day.  Yeah.  And they packed you in like sardines.  And then they stop at each stop, and just more people are piling on.  And you're like, there's no way they can get more people on this train. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, they do.  Oh, do they?  Do they?  Then they drop you off, and you got to walk.  I'm not.  I was drenched.  It was the only way, though.  You can't drive to Shea Stadium anymore.  Got to make more friends.  Got to make a little few more friends.  Oh, I found friends at the game.  Oh, did you?  Let's just put it this way.  I found friends at the game, and I did not have to take the 7 train back to Manhattan.  It's very convenient when you got friends. 
[00:12:00]  And you know me.  I like to leave early to beat the crowd, you know.  Because even a 4 o'clock game, it's a school night.  I mean, the game ended at like 7.30.  And then you got to think, two hours to get back to Manhattan?  Yeah.  Unless you bump into some friends at Shea Stadium.  That's it.  And then it's a mere 15-minute ride.  See, you got to have the right friends.  Just a mere 15-minute ride.  Oh, you should see the speed dial on my phone. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Just involves precinct after precinct.  But the Mets look great.  Yankees got rained out last night.  So you can go to today's game.  1 o'clock game today.  Yeah, sure I can.  That was the big gift from XM for our two years doing radio.  Hope Dan enjoys those tickets.  Because the last ones that I gave him, because I couldn't make, weren't as good a seats as the ones that he's got now.  Dan has like amazing seats now for today's game.  Which I had to give him because it was rained out last night. 
[00:13:00]  Do you know Shea and Yankee Stadium, if there was a nuclear war and everybody was dead and there was no traffic, I know it would be silly to drive between stadiums at that point with such tragedy of a nuclear war.  But if you just chose to, just to see how long it would take, it's probably an eight-minute drive with no one else on the road.  How could one stadium be rained out and the other one, they play the full game?  It was weird when I got back to Manhattan around, I'm not kidding, the game ended at 7.15. 
[00:13:30]  I was in my door by 7.45.  It was the most amazing thing.  And that place was packed last night.  And as soon as I turned the key, it started raining.  It was like perfect timing.  Perfect.  It must have been raining already at Yankee Stadium.  You had the earlier game, right?  Yeah, 4 o'clock.  That was the difference.  It was perfect.  It was a perfect day for baseball.  Yeah.  A lot of fun.  And just want to say hi to everyone once again that I met at the game.  I mean, everywhere. 
[00:14:00]  Just everywhere I walked.  I didn't know.  I didn't get to go to a game last night.  You didn't get to eat the food?  Rain down.  What food?  How was your physical?  Oh, you know something?  That guy that I described as an Indian man.  Yeah.  That was to come over and give me my exam for the insurance policy that our agent is taking out on us.  It turned out to be a big, fat, black woman.  What?  Dude, I swear on the phone, it was an Indian man. 
[00:14:30]  Indian man, fat Haitian woman.  And I should have known because as a nurse, they're all nurses.  They're big, like, fat, black woman.  Matronly.  Matronly.  And she comes in, pokes with, you know, takes some blood.  Yeah.  I had a big, I give a urine sample.  Yeah.  And then, you know, she has your blood pressure.  She puts a glove on, you throw her an extra 200.  Don't use that.  I got my own lube. 
[00:15:00]  And then she's gone.  I'm like, thanks.  That's why I couldn't eat the wonderfulness of the food that was brought in yesterday.  The Alaskan king crabs, the lobster tails, the blay, ice cream cake, big, huge muffins.  Jimmy had three slices of ice cream cake yesterday.  And on the walk from the studio to the corner, about a block or so, he was so gassy that we  were thanking God the show was over and we weren't trapped in the studio with you. 
[00:15:30]  They weren't dry ones either, man.  How'd it work out for you?  It was cool.  Yeah.  A couple trips in.  Did things work out?  Because I know you were yearning for a bathroom.  Yeah.  I found my third grade report card.  The food was amazing.  And we got to thank Rivoli's and Tom's River once again.  A faithful listener of the show just came by to take care of us and do it upright for us.  That was very nice of him.  But it was Tony, right?  Let's say hi to Rob in Jersey. 
[00:16:00]  Rob, what's up?  Hey.  Rob.  Hey there, Rob.  Can you hear me?  Rob.  I really want to go to this phone call.  Are the phones messed up today?  Rob.  Hello?  Yellow.  All right.  Let me try Mark in Colorado.  Mark.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah, Rob's the ass.  Yeah, it works.  No, I just want to make sure the phone works.  What you want to talk about stinks.  Thanks, Mark.  Rob in Jersey.  Darn it.  Darn it.  Uh-huh.  It says Pest should all take Opie to work to try different stuff. 
[00:16:30]  I know that's like a hack radio bit, but I would...  Take Opie to work day?  I would consider that.  What would you do?  What could you do?  What skills do you have aside from this?  Wow.  And I mean real skills, not, you know, Ron Howard asking you to act in a movie.  The sad part is I don't have any skills.  Could you...  I really don't have any skills.  Could you solder together a fitting?  Hell no.  No?  Hell no.  You can move furniture.  I did that when I was in college. 
[00:17:00]  Not fun at all.  Nah, if someone has an interesting job out there, I know it's hacky radio crap, but I'll  make it interesting somehow.  I'll try it out.  I'll try it out on TPS reports.  Uh, what?  Maybe a pimp could take you to work and you can go noodling.  You want to go noodling?  Wow, noodling.  You don't want to go noodling.  Why not?  Because it's not a job, first of all.  It is a job.  They sell the catfish.  It's not a job.  I want to try some noodling.  You need some laborer type work. 
[00:17:30]  I want to get you.  It'll, uh, it'll endear you with the working class.  I will try window washer on the side of a 50 to 60 story building.  That's crazy.  I'd like to see you do that.  A lot of buildings going up in Manhattan.  I want to go to the top.  Bob Eatman's calling.  Uh, you have to have your exam first.  I want to go to the top of one of these buildings being constructed.  I want to go underground in Manhattan.  Steelworker.  You want to do some of the steelworker stuff?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Throwing hot rivets at each other.  Yeah.  Like it's 1952. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  I want to go underground.  I want to check out mold people.  I want to see what goes on.  There's no job under there.  There's jobs underneath.  All right.  All right.  What?  Like their MTA?  They're, uh, they're, they're, uh, digging a really huge tunnel under Manhattan.  A water tunnel.  Yeah, but they have to go down like a half mile or something.  It's crazy.  Yeah, they've been digging that for years.  It's on TV.  It's coming from what?  Lake George or something?  Something crazy?  They're taking it from some big reservoir and then they're going to pump the water here  into New York.  So it's this huge tunnel.  I want to do, I want to go down there and see what that's about. 
[00:18:30]  Might have seen that in one of the Die Hard movies where they drive the big dump trucks  through it.  It's pretty, uh, yeah.  It's got to be a long tunnel.  Uh.  Yeah, quite long, Jim.  All right, here's some water, Jim.  Here's Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  Hey there, Rob.  Hi.  Like I called earlier, um, take Opie to Workday.  It should be sponsored.  You should sponsor everything else.  Oh, believe me, it'll be sponsored.  I know that, I'm going to say it again.  I know this is a borderline hack radio bit, but.  Borderline.  But I've been doing radio since I was 18, and all kidding aside, I love the show, and 
[00:19:00]  I love what's been happening with us.  Absolutely.  But I also want to see what else is out there.  I'm getting to that point.  I want to see what else is out there.  Yeah.  I've been there.  I actually.  It's miserable people doing miserable jobs.  You know that I actually thought about going back to the Huntington Crescent Club and  just caddying on weekends for the hell of it?  You're crazy.  Even though I don't need the money or anything, just to do something different.  You're crazy.  Why?  Because there's no need to.  Yeah.  There's no need. 
[00:19:30]  Why would you do that?  Stop feeling guilty because life is so good.  I'm not feeling guilty.  He feels guilty because he's making a lot of money doing what he loves.  Let me tell you something.  That is a great job for a kid who's starting out.  So what it amounts to is it's hard work.  No, it was my favorite job of all time, being a caddy.  Got to talk to different people every day.  Got up really early before the sun.  Got some exercise.  It's one of those, look, what are you doing here?  You're getting up early in the morning and talking to a lot of people. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, and you do push-ups in between.  That's your exercise.  So there's your exercise.  Oh, yeah.  You want some golf clubs?  We'll get you some clubs.  And you talk to Kenny, which helps the retarded.  It's charitable.  Man, you guys are keeping me down.  Keeping you down?  You're keeping me down, man.  I'm just telling you, you want a real job, hit one of the job sites, and tote around to  two-by-fours.  All I want to know is if I'm good at something else.  That's all.  That's all.  What do you want to do?  Do you want to start over maybe and then get in this business this late in the game  and become like what?  Like a piece of filth?  Like you rock.  No offense. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  But I mean, do you want to start off and rebuild this whole thing like that garbage  over?  I'm just using it as an example.  Be happy.  It's great.  Why don't you start over?  Well, in a lot of interviews, we talk about how this is the greatest job in America.  I'm just wondering if it is.  That's all.  Let me tell you something.  It's the greatest job that we can get right now.  It has nothing to do with money.  Is there something else out there that is more interesting than what we do?  Male prostitution?  Sure.  If it had nothing to do with money? 
[00:21:00]  It's dirty jobs meets jackass.  Well, there you go.  You better call A&E.  There's our idea.  There's our idea.  Dirty jobs meets jackass.  We go out on the job sites.  Huh?  Go out on jobs and get our hands a little dirty.  People aren't getting it.  One guy works for the phone company.  It has to be something that really, really is different.  I want to saw the skull of a dead person.  What? 
[00:21:30]  What happened?  It's fun.  No, that's not a joke.  I really want to do that.  I know.  I really want to do something like that.  I think you was car crashing the insanity of the sentiment.  Exactly.  Not the quality of the joke.  I want to, like, yeah, saw into a skull at a coroner's office.  So find a coroner who's a fan and say, hey, look, let me get in there and saw that.  Open heart surgery.  I want to, like, hold something. 
[00:22:00]  I don't think that's allowed.  I know.  I understand that.  Yeah.  But there's got to be other things out there that I could do for maybe a couple hours.  Rob, Jersey, what's up?  Why did my husband die on the table?  Well, it's bring radio guy to work day.  Greg Opie Hughes decided he was going to suture him up.  He got a little, yeah, squeamish and vomited into the wound.  Into the cavity.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, you can come to work with me, Opie.  I'm a scientist.  What do you do, though?  I make cancer drugs, and I test the process.  How'd you stumble out of this show accidentally? 
[00:22:30]  Well, because I'm really an idiot.  I kind of more, like, fell into the job.  Oh, really?  Good job you guys are doing.  It's still there.  What's he doing?  Inventing cancer drugs.  Oh, so nothing.  Things that give it to you.  All right.  I know.  Thank you.  Making great strides and blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, we are.  Well, it's just a thought.  All right.  We've got to start our show.  We're just warming up.  I'm not kidding, though.  If someone had an interesting job out there, I would try it for an afternoon.  Why not? 
[00:23:00]  Why not?  Interesting, huh?  Well, someone says filling potholes.  That's not that great, right?  That's real work.  It's a real job.  An electrician.  I watched my dad do some of that stuff around the house.  That's whatever.  Pull some wire.  Drive a livery van.  I'm a track worker for the MTA.  Okay, now we're talking.  Angelo.  Whoa, what's going on, boys?  What do you got, man?  What can I do?  All right, listen.  I work in a track department for New York City Transit.  So, allegedly, I can take you to come work with me. 
[00:23:30]  I was from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. at night.  All right, you come on down to a rail gang.  We'll hook you up.  You'll have a ball.  Angela from Brooklyn.  You'll be carrying a carpet, rolled up carpet, down into the lower tunnels.  Don't just talk about this on the show, all right?  Feet hanging out.  We'll hook you up.  We'll hook you up.  Lovely, all right?  We'll make you down.  Imagine.  What a great job.  We love you.  But that's it.  We'll talk from the track department.  We listen to you guys basically on our way home to our loved ones every day. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  You guys are the best.  Thank you, Angelo.  We didn't plan this coming into today's show, but now it's becoming something.  But he's on.  Like, I want to be.  I want to, like, follow up like a hitman around for a night.  Well, that.  That type of stuff.  I don't know if you're going to get that one.  Not the basic jobs.  I want some.  Like, there's got to be some crazy jobs out there.  You're just a boy looking for adventure.  So, you want something a little special.  A little different, right?  You want something more special than just what everyone else is doing out there.  Right, right.  Unless their job has a little twist. 
[00:24:30]  I was confused.  I thought you wanted to do roofing for a day or something.  No, I want something that piques my interest and I go, wow, I'm pretty good at this.  He's a boy looking for wonderment.  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  Luke, what's up?  Hey, you want to milk some cows?  Ugh.  That's a nasty job.  Your hands smell like cow teats.  Yeah.  The whole day.  Would you drink right out of a cow odor?  No.  No.  Why not?  You have palty milk. 
[00:25:00]  No.  Why not?  Because their udders are all yuck.  They got like flaky skin on them.  You ever see what's floating on the top of a milk pail after people milk?  Yeah, I just go right out and drink a little flaky udder skin.  There's like gook on top.  Yeah.  Cow underbelly gook that drops into that.  I don't even like milk pasteurized and in a container.  I cringe when I eat cereal.  I just put a little bit of milk on it because I hate milk. 
[00:25:30]  It's out of a cow.  All right, I got one.  The only thing I like integrated is my coffee.  Well, yeah, that's true.  Hey, I got one.  A lot of cup of coffee.  Who kills the rats in Manhattan?  I'll follow him for a day.  I guess there's probably the...  I'll follow a rat killer around.  I don't think they actually go around bonking him on the head with little silver hammers.  I think they just put out the traps.  Yeah, I know, but they...  That you see all over the place.  But they get the call like, wow, we have a rat problem in this part of the city.  Some public works. 
[00:26:00]  And then this person has to go there and he has to set the traps and the poison and whatever else.  Maybe the little nets.  Nets.  I just see those big black boxes with the entry and...  Well, I guess they're just entry.  They're not exits.  Yeah.  Checking out Mr. Rat.  They just go in and that's it.  Let's go to Fred in New York City.  Set those down in the little parks.  Fred.  Hello.  Hey, Fred.  How you guys doing?  Good.  How you doing?  Good, good, good.  You can come to work with me, I'll be... 
[00:26:30]  What do you do?  I work for the medical examiner.  Oh.  Can I actually go there?  Can he be Sam?  Can I go there, really?  I would really have to find out, but that would be cool.  All right, find out and call me back because I'll do that one.  No problem.  Why would you want to do that?  That is a depressing kind of...  Huh?  It's a cool job.  No, it's not.  It's morbid.  I just want to go there and just go,  Ha ha, you're dead. 
[00:27:00]  No, sir.  I think the joke would be wasted on him.  Do you get a particularly attractive drug mule and you search a little longer than you have to?  All right, Fred.  I'm serious.  If someone has an interesting job out there,  this is kind of borderline dirty jobs or something.  I get it.  Maybe it is like dirty jobs meets jackass.  But I would definitely check out a few more occupations.  You'll have fun.  I don't know where this came from, by the way.  We were just saying hello and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[00:27:30]  Enough about the dress!  O.P. and Anthony, they belong on the radio.  See, they're telling you something right there.  That's a sign.  Yeah.  It's like, O.P. and Anthony, they belong on the radio  because we are just not cut out for the other things in life,  the other lines of work.  I think this is where I got the spark.  When we were in the office and that commercial came out,  I'm like, you know, what if we really had to do another job?  So now I'm thinking I've got to try some jobs out there. 
[00:28:00]  I have a trade that I could always fall back on,  but I don't think I'd be paying my mortgage with it.  No, not even everyone in the union gave their salaries over.  I don't think I could swing the lifestyle I've become accustomed to knocking tin anymore.  See, when we blew up our careers because of this extra Sam thing,  the panic set in because I'm thinking,  oh, my God, when the money runs out in 20 years,  what am I going to do next?  What am I going to do next? 
[00:28:30]  20 years.  That's just a joke.  Slow joke.  Humor.  All right, we're just getting warmed up.  We're going to do a real show today.  Mark Foley promo from The Buzz.  What's that about?  Mark Foley homo?  What?  The Buzz in West Palm?  Yeah, they're doing a little thing, but Mark Foley?  Cool.  Oh, promo.  Good.  We'll check that out.  We got a lot to do today, so why don't we step aside and we'll continue in a bit.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:29:00]  Hit a nerve today, I guess.  Phones are just lit.  Everybody wants to take me to work with them.  I'm serious about this.  I don't even know how this began.  Man, we just started the show and you never know what direction we're going in.  Could you like email Steve at foundrymusic.com if you have a really good job you want me to do for a day?  It's got to be really interesting and very unusual.  Something different.  Not necessarily a dirty job, but I'll do a dirty job. 
[00:29:30]  Will you?  I'll do a jackass type of job.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't know what example that would be like.  Cesspool sucker?  I don't know.  One of those guys that pull that big ick pipe up to the cesspool, hook it up and suck it out.  Or a port-a-john cleaner?  No, I would go down into a cesspool.  You would go down into a cesspool?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  With respirator equipment on there?  Whatever, yeah.  Yeah, like I would do that, yeah.  Well, you wouldn't do anything with porn?  You wouldn't have to be sexually excited by it.  You wouldn't have to be turned on. 
[00:30:00]  Most of them are not turned on.  Like the guys that are filming it.  As a job, to go in there and see it as a job, to watch the way these people make their  living, it really is amazing.  Like a boom operator?  You've done that, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I've watched them do it.  I may be doing it again soon.  You'd be amazed to watch them.  Like, you don't really get turned on because it's a movie set.  Yeah.  To watch people in porn do what they do, just objectively, is amazing.  I guess I would check that out.  It's like you're watching, sex is hard enough to have one-on-one, but to watch men who are  truly machines and women, it's like you're professionals. 
[00:30:30]  And to watch them working with the camera, the director going, all right, two more minutes  of this.  Two more minutes.  Come on, guys.  Let me...  It's like the director's barking stuff out at them.  Orders and...  Oh, my God.  And these guys, like...  And they're just machines.  Nothing fazes them.  Occasionally it does.  They say, he's struggling.  Really?  Yeah.  He's struggling.  You don't want to hear that.  Because I think it's difficult to come back from hearing he's struggling.  Yeah.  You're not like, oh...  Because then you're thinking, oh, I'm struggling.  I am struggling.  And then you just struggle more at that point. 
[00:31:00]  And then you get this.  All right.  Bring in the other guy.  And if you get a reputation of being a struggler, no good.  Forget it.  You're out of the business.  Focus.  Trum you out.  Focus.  Oh, now I'm telling myself to focus.  Oh, it's not going to work.  That's never good.  Hey, well, everyone's calling.  But you can email Steve at foundrymusic.com.  It's got to be something really, really unusual and different.  I'm a cardiovascular heart technician.  That could be interesting.  What are you going to do with him, though?  Exactly.  There's nothing you could do that would bring about lawsuits or something. 
[00:31:30]  Armored truck driver.  That could be cool, I guess.  No, you need the proper training and licensing.  Yeah.  I work for the CIA.  I don't think they're going to work.  The CIA is going to let you in.  Commercial lobster man.  Yeah, what the hell are you going to do with him?  Matt in Jersey, what's up?  Yeah, I got a dirty job for you.  Yeah?  I'm a page for the Senate.  Now that is a filthy, dirty job.  There you go.  I'm a cop in the Bronx. 
[00:32:00]  We get to do ride-alongs already.  Dentist on Rikers Island.  That sounds interesting, but I don't think you could help him.  But what does he do?  Yeah.  You're really a dentist on Rikers Island?  Yeah.  God bless America.  And you treat the prisoners, I would gather?  Pardon?  You treat the prisoners?  Yeah.  Do you use any Novocaine?  What if there's, like, some real creep, pedophile guy? 
[00:32:30]  Do you use a little less Novocaine?  Well, you try to.  There's ways of making it a little more, you know, less...  You'd be a little less cordial, I guess.  But usually, when they come in, we don't know what they...  I was going to ask if you know what their crimes are.  Oh, that would be the greatest thing ever.  If you know the crime of the person before they sit down in your chair.  You'd do a few oopsies.  Yeah, a few whoopsie-daisy with that hook.  That pin hook.  I went a little deeper than I was supposed to.  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, but who are you going to tell? 
[00:33:00]  Who's going to believe you?  You're in prison.  Was this Moeller, right?  Oh, no, it's not?  All right.  Well, we can't put this one back, but I'll pull this one.  All right, Andrew.  I don't know.  So call or email steve at foundrymusic.com.  Everyone's calling now.  But it's just got to be very different and unique.  Hey, I love Metallica.  Jimmy, you love Metallica.  Anthony loves Metallica.  I even like the fact that people that don't like them said they sold out with the Black 
[00:33:30]  Album.  How?  Yeah, I know.  Well, there's those people.  Who says that?  There's people.  People are saying.  I love old Metallica, but the Black Album, one of the greatest albums ever made.  Yeah, agreed.  Now there's the hardcore fans.  You don't even know Metallica.  That's why they started showing up.  I don't know nothing about music.  I don't know.  Nothing else matters is great.  They're music of late.  I'm not really good.  Wherever I may roam.  I'm not digging their music of late.  But that stuff, great. 
[00:34:00]  The earlier stuff, fantastic.  Just a great band with longevity, great story, great personality.  Battery.  What's better than Battery off Master of Puppets?  Come on.  I guess.  I don't think anything.  Master of Puppets is a great album, too.  Yes, absolutely.  But I may have to just hang up my fanboy card for Metallica.  Yeah, Jimmy hasn't heard this yet.  Oh.  Dan was playing something in the office.  I swear to you, I thought it was one of our silly listeners trying to be funny, trying 
[00:34:30]  to come up with something for the radio show.  Danny found this?  Oh, it was Danny.  Derek found this?  Derek found this.  Sorry.  Perish the thought.  I give somebody else credit.  Why am I looking at this waif in the glass door?  Derek.  Derek found it.  Well, I really.  And when Thand was playing it in the office, I was like, get that on a CD so we could goof  on it.  Like, this is so bad from one of our listeners.  We've got to have fun with this.  It turns out what you're about to hear is really Metallica.  From when, though?  Like, what is it? 
[00:35:00]  This is brand new.  Oh, no.  It's ringtones.  It's on their website, and you can buy them for $3 each.  Metallica ringtones.  Do they really need the money at this point?  And do they really need to do them in this fashion?  Right.  Someone has to, like, tell them that these stink.  But I think you get so famous that you get the people around you that are too scared  to tell you that something is awful.  I really believe that.  Do you think?  Because I think their friends at least could say, you know, dude, do you think there's 
[00:35:30]  a ringtone thing that's good?  No.  No.  No cruises problem.  No one just says, shut up.  Yeah.  No.  Everyone is too scared because they like their part of the organization.  You don't want to be kicked out of the inner circle.  Right.  Nobody teases you when you're there anymore.  No.  So here's some Metallica ringtones.  Listen to this.  Whose phone is that?  Oh, it's yours.  This is James from Metallica.  Pick it up.  See, that one's just basic voice.  Yeah.  You know, so it's not that bad. 
[00:36:00]  You're saying, why are you making such a big deal, guys?  That's just him saying something.  It's not that big a deal.  Hey, this is James from Metallica.  I'm stuck in your pocket.  It stinks in here.  Answer the phone.  All right.  More just talking.  That's a little comedic.  And he's trying to be funny and failing miserably.  But he's not a comedian.  It's just a little voiceover thing.  But meh, meh, meh, meh.  That's the European ring. 
[00:36:30]  This is James from Metallica.  Pick up.  I don't like the fact that he's saying James from Metallica.  He should say it's James Hetfield.  No.  Because any Metallica fan knows who Hetfield is.  No, because if you're buying these ringtones, you know it's a Metallica ringtone.  You're already a fan, so you don't need to be reminded it's James from Metallica.  That's the first mistake they're making.  It's for other people who are listening who wouldn't know who that was.  It's not for you.  Yeah, but you would tell people.  Like, I had Ben snore as my ring for the longest time. 
[00:37:00]  And it starts snoring.  And that means I got a phone call coming in.  And people would go, what the hell is that?  And then I would be able to tell them what it is.  What else is there?  Well, this is where it gets really bad.  For whom the phone rings, pick it up.  James from Metallica says, pick up the phone.  Yeah.  For whom the phone rings. 
[00:37:30]  Now, I.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It doesn't end there, Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton.  Who told him this was good?  I'm just having fast forward nightmares.  Yeah.  I'm picking up the phone on a crazy ring.  No.  How much money can you make off of it?  Hello, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  Right.  God, no.  Here's the next one.  It gets worse.  Sad but true. 
[00:38:00]  Your mom's on the phone.  James from Metallica says, pick up the phone.  Sad but true.  Your mom's on the phone.  Uh.  See, because we're all supposed to hate our parents.  Yeah.  Uh.  The only one of those I'll accept is if your friend has been hit by a car and whatever he  calls you, motor breath plays. 
[00:38:30]  See?  Because that ties in cleverly.  Of course.  Give me those elbows.  There you go.  There you go.  Wow.  Give me those elbows.  Give me those elbows so I can smack myself in the thin lips.  He gets really creative with this next one.  Yeah.  Master!  Master!  Your wife's calling.  Pick up the phone.  See?  Because she's...  She's the master.  I want to punch Metallica in the face. 
[00:39:00]  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is it.  It's over.  What happened?  You thought the Napster thing was bad.  You thought they were selling out with some of the albums they were putting out.  And it's kind of...  But this right here is it.  This is where even I must agree.  It's over, Johnny.  I liked the Napster.  I didn't blame them for not wanting to be ripped off.  Oh, shut up.  No, I mean that.  I liked that fact.  They had to do it.  Not you, Jimmy.  I was just saying shut up to Metallica. 
[00:39:30]  But this.  Lars.  You don't have to do this.  Does Lars do any?  Does anybody else do any?  Of course.  Of course, Lars does it.  Mostly James, though.  Mostly James, but...  Ready for the last one from James?  Oh, yeah.  Wherever is your phone?  This is James from Metallica.  Pick up.  That's the one I heard.  And I was like, it has to be one of our listeners just goofing on ringtones. 
[00:40:00]  Wherever is your phone?  It doesn't even make sense.  Yeah, how about pick up because you're on Rome?  Why not?  Why not?  I really thought that was a listener.  Why not?  Just goofing on ringtones.  I'm like, we have to play this.  It's horrible.  But it's actually them doing ringtones.  People...  The government should monitor you, and if you spend $3 for one of them, they should just  send electricity into you and kill you through the phone.  Somehow.  Here's one more from Kirk. 
[00:40:30]  That's right.  Seek and destroy your phone.  It doesn't even make sense.  Why not?  That one doesn't even make sense.  Why not?  Why would you destroy your phone?  Just because it's ringing.  Seek and destroy your phone.  Well, it ties in because, like, Seek and Destroy is the song, but the phone thing has to tie  in.  Yeah.  So it's Seek and Destroy your phone. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  With the Four Horsemen ride and answer your phone.  Makes sense.  Master of puppets is pulling your string and answering the phone.  Answering the phone.  Put that anywhere.  Works.  Let's say hi to Rob.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  James Hetfield, the new Gene Simmons.  Well.  Ah.  Could be.  I don't know.  They're just trying to capitalize?  There's better ways to do it, though. 
[00:41:30]  That is hacky and just awful.  Just put the guitar riffs.  Like, I wouldn't mind hearing that guitar riff that Kirk just did.  Yeah.  Fine.  We'll answer.  Yeah.  That's all you need.  Beth, I hear you calling.  Will you please pick up the phone?  They could do that, Kiss.  They could all get together and put out their own ringtones.  I'm sure they have ringtones out there somewhere.  You think?  Gene gets all the money.  All about ringtones.  Doesn't matter who does it.  Gene gets the money.  I had some ringtones that I suggested.  They weren't cute, though.  No?  Yeah.  Like? 
[00:42:00]  Kara from MySpace is actually using one.  Remember we did a bunch of ringtones out there at XM?  Oh, that's true.  We did them as a group.  They were really bad.  Ringy, dingy, dingy.  Pick up the phone, see?  Really obnoxious.  Let's say hi to Kramer in Pittsburgh.  Blown up in Pittsburgh.  What's up, Kramer?  Not much, guys.  I got six Metallica tattoos, but as soon as I get home, I'm going to get a cheese grater.  They're coming off.  Yeah, not happy about the ringtones, huh?  Six Metallica tats, boy.  Dude, I'm sick. 
[00:42:30]  My son is James Hetfield's pick on his crib.  I'm tearing that off when I get home, too.  All right, bro.  They just don't have to do that.  Dave and Yonkers, what's up?  What is this, the kinder, gentler James Hetfield?  If I could get James Hetfield from Kill'em All to, like, go in a time machine, he'd come  out and kick the shit out of this James Hetfield.  You don't think present-day James Hetfield would enjoy hanging out with the old James Hetfield?  The old James Hetfield would beat him up.  Nah, that would be a problem.  There would be a fight.  There would be a fight that pops out of a time machine and just pummels the new James Hetfield. 
[00:43:00]  I think new James Hetfield would smash the old one because the old one was all beard  up.  He'd be a drinker.  He was all skinny.  New James is like a strapping, biker-type build.  I don't know.  I think old James, though, because he's a little juiced up and so angry at the new James,  would probably throw a pretty good scrap at him.  Maybe.  Yeah.  And he's younger.  He was sober and would have all that rage that now can't be covered with alcohol  and is coming out through fisticuffs.  And he'd hear that ringtone and just the anger in the old James. 
[00:43:30]  That's true.  The anger might do it over the ringtone.  Pops out.  Although, if it's Terminator rules, he'd be naked and that would be a little awkward  because you've got to come through naked.  I don't know.  I'm going to really have to give this some thought.  Yeah, we're going to have to figure that out.  Bob in Jersey.  What's up, Bob?  Yo, man.  What's up, guys?  I'm a huge fan.  What's going on?  What's up?  I can't even believe what I just heard.  Yeah, we couldn't either.  Literally couldn't believe that it was Metallica, but it's on their site.  And we, like Ope said, thought it was a goofy fan. 
[00:44:00]  A fan just trying to be funny and get our attention.  No.  It's James.  It's really Metallica trying to do ringtones.  And I'm with Jimmy.  I mean, if you just got a nice guitar riff from one of those guys.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  That'd be cool.  That's all you need.  Just guitar riffs.  Yeah, I wouldn't mind hearing a bit of this.  Can people use music for their phone?  That's fine.  You're a fan.  You know who it is.  You don't need James to even say anything.  Just, you know, let's hear some guitar.  I like when I hear someone's phone ring with a cool, you know, guitar riff.  I, by the way, can't stand it. 
[00:44:30]  You can't stand ringtones?  I don't.  I like the fact that new phones come out with a new ring.  Some brr, brr, something like that.  I don't like the retro ring.  Who's got that one?  Everybody.  I think I do.  Stop it with the goddamn one that sounds like the oldie time phone.  They change that for a reason.  You know what's great about that?  It is the most annoying sound.  Everyone that has that as a ringtone, they think they're the only ones, and they think  they're the only ones that was clever enough to come up with the old school. 
[00:45:00]  Look, it sounds like an old type phone.  First of all.  Is that a cell phone or an old bell phone?  Oh.  But everyone thought they were clever.  Yeah.  By getting that one.  You're not alone.  That's probably one of the hottest ringtones out there, the old school phone ring.  I wind up keeping the one that my phone came with.  I could care less what the hell it sounds like.  It doesn't have many options, so I just put that one because it was just an option.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  I got the hybrid.  I'm not a queer who thought it was queer.  Download it.  I got Steve's hybrid car as a text message. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, that's fun.  How do you do that?  Different.  How do you do that?  Just give your phone to Danny.  No.  Actually, he was going to give me some new ringtones yesterday.  Was he?  Yeah.  Just stuff that has something to do with the show.  Like, I want secret agent man on mine.  On my car.  Yeah.  That means you got a message or something?  A text comes in.  A text?  Yeah.  Do you know what I want to hear?  See, mine's the same for text and phone.  I don't care.  When my phone is ringing, I want to hear, how did your parents die?  Why not?  How did your parents die?  Why not?  How'd your parents die? 
[00:46:00]  Why not?  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  Listen to that acting.  You can barely distinguish any difference.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  He should have been in the departed.  He actually sounds more upset at why not.  Why not?  Yeah, there's more emotion there.  How'd your parents die?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not?  You can hear his nose crinkling.  Why not?  Why not?  Hey, I'm looking at a picture of a midget with flipper hands.  This is going up on our website.  Wow.  It's up there, Erock.  OpianAnthony.com. 
[00:46:30]  A midget sighting right outside, what, XM?  Was he born the day Hitler died?  Because it had to be reincarnation.  You got to see this picture.  Erock's midget with flipper hands.  Erock's midget sighting outside of XM Studios yesterday.  It's up on OpianAnthony.com.  Oh, getting into a little cab?  The little fella needs help with the door.  Little flipper arm.  Of course he does.  Yuck.  What does he do with toilet paper?  Where did I take you, pal?  The East River.  I'm jumping in.  I can't take it anymore.  You heff-a-porpoise.  He takes some of the garment. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, no.  Come on.  No, there's no way to do it.  No, go ahead.  I hailed you down, sir, so you could run over me.  Oh, look at the little fella trying to hop in the cab with flipper hands.  Oh, it's just awful.  Who puts his shoes on?  Looks like-  Yeah.  How does he put his shoes on?  You know that they're all-  I guarantee you they're all, like, uh, laceless.  He slips them on.  They're all slip-on shoes.  Looks like God was hungover that morning.  Oh, he's-  Oh, God.  Wow, his face looks like Big A, kinda. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah?  He's got a Big A face.  He's got flipper hands, and he's-  And a bun.  And he's, uh, and he's a fat midget.  He's got a bun.  And he has a belt.  You think you just get sweatpants.  How does he fix the little belt?  How do you become a fat midget when you have flipper hands?  All you have to do is, like, you have to beg someone to feed you.  It's not even really-  Wait, you're not on.  Hold on, Ann.  I'm sorry about that.  Why would I be?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  What?  It's not so much flipper hands, because I see fingers there.  It looks like he's got his hands coming right out of his shoulders. 
[00:48:00]  Like he's got T-Rex arms.  Literally has T-Rex arms where they're very, very short.  And his body, shaped like a T-Rex.  Very big at the bottom.  And then it gets slender at the top, and he's got a big T-Rex head.  And he's kind of leaning in to open the cab.  And it looks like he's jumping in jolly midget fashion.  Like, you could Photoshop that, like, in a flower patch.  He's, like, up on one tippy toe.  It looks like he's almost in midair.  If you look at the picture. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  You could picture elf music playing.  Oompa.  Loompa.  That's what he is.  A little oompa loompa.  Where to the East River?  Jimmy.  Just dump him in.  Could someone explain to me how he's fat, though?  If he's got flipper hands that don't reach his mouth?  I don't know.  He probably likes all throwable food.  He eats a lot of pretzels.  Yeah, they throw things at him.  Dumplings.  Or his owners might just put the bowl on the floor.  His owners.  He eats out of the bowl on the floor.  They leave the food out.  What, Iroch?  He was trying to get out. 
[00:49:00]  Why would that be on?  Hold on, what?  He was trying to get out, but he couldn't do the door, so the cab driver had to lean  over and open the door and shut the door.  Oh, how horrifying.  The only thing that would be great about that is if there was some kind of a car fire and  the cabbie panicked and ran out.  Just watch the midget bar.  Old broken wing arms just sit in the back with his clipped wings, trying to flutter out  of the cage.  Oh, Jesus.  And his stupid flipper arms.  I like to just grab his arm and squeeze it and go, why are you living?  What is this? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, maybe if someone, maybe he's like a balloon, you could squeeze that fat ass of  his and let the air go into his arms and watch him pop out.  Whoop, there you go, open the door, idiot.  If you squeeze his bunch, his arms come out.  Yeah.  A little fat, awful belly.  All right, well, there you go.  That's up on opiananthony.com for your viewing pleasure.  I think he should be in a flower patch.  Please put him in a flower patch with some type of a degrading, happy, flowered midget hat. 
[00:50:00]  With a little carnation on it.  Yeah, make him cast a spell somewhere.  Little flipper arms.  Toodly-doo.  That's the noise he probably makes everywhere he walks.  Toodly-doo.  Little fat spellcaster.  Oh, what a burden.  What do you think his parents did?  What do you think his parents did when they finally saw that?  LSD?  Oh.  Yeah, or some type of a Dylan and Eric bond.  Like, all right, look, we'll just put on one glove each and kill ourselves. 
[00:50:30]  Leave him on the church steps.  Yeah, that is really horrid.  That must have been a hell of a birth.  Comes out head first.  You see the flipper hands.  You see the butt.  Then you see the feet.  I think Rosemary was happier at the final product.  But now we take a break.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  That's right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:51:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Spreading across America.  Instant feedback.  You can do that through opiananthony.com.  Some dude on his cell phone.  Use your real name, ass.  He just writes,  Making fun of midgets, fat women, and retarded people.  Wow.  Real cutting edge.  Out of ideas for the show already?  Not out of ideas at all.  He's got his phone number right up there.  First of all, does he?  Yeah, if it came from a phone, 
[00:51:30]  his name usually shows up as a phone number.  Well, his feedback's not accurate.  We've only made fun of midgets so far.  Yeah.  Have we made fun of retarded people yet today?  Not yet.  And there's more on this midget.  We're not finished.  Oh, please.  And we haven't made fun of fat women yet today?  No, we're looking for fat women.  We're looking to pay fat women.  For God's sake.  Fatty Pig Fatty is brought to you by H57.  Who do you?  Lose weight for free at H57.com.  Frank Caliendo in studio.  Did you hear about our Fatty Pig Fatty contest? 
[00:52:00]  Not really.  It's a good one, man.  This is wonderful.  This is a terrific idea.  You know, fat broads are always getting a raw deal.  They are.  And we figure it's time to reward them for their overweight-ness.  Overweightedness.  So we're offering money for their fat.  And it's up to $10 a pound, at least, is what we're given.  So far, the leader is a 430-pound girl that's going to get $4,300. 
[00:52:30]  Wow.  That's $4,300.  Now we're looking for someone bigger, though.  That's right.  And we know they're out there.  Where's the 450?  Where's the 480?  That's $4,800.  If you weigh 480 pounds, and you're sitting there right now, or if you're a husband of  a wife that weighs 480 pounds, or a friend, wouldn't you call her up and go, look, I know  you're a big girl, but we got the opportunity to make some real cake here. 
[00:53:00]  And you love cake, you pig.  Get in here.  This contest is at a standstill right now.  Yeah.  We know there's fatter women out there.  Come on.  What's the problem?  They think we're going to make fun of them?  What's the deal?  Crystal from Cleveland.  And her name was Crystal, by the way.  430-pound Crystal.  Strip her name.  That's nice.  That's like a hot Gertrude.  You're not going to find one.  Gertie.  Gertie.  And she's really hot.  Back in the day.  Come on, man.  Help us out.  The contest is great, but it's at a standstill. 
[00:53:30]  We thought by now we'd have someone beating 430 pounds.  Where are you?  Call us.  Call us.  Use a fake name and a fake town you're from, and let's talk this out a little bit today.  I know the truckers are out there.  They could help us.  They've seen the fat women on the roads.  Haul them around?  Yeah.  They're pretty much hauling them in the back of the truck.  And then Kenny has to run in with this little item from the paper today.  Look at him with his greeting glasses on.  Oh, Kenny.  I can't take credit for this. 
[00:54:00]  This was brought to my attention by Mr. Chiasano.  Oh.  It's a picture from the Daily News today.  Some big fat porker.  The title is Big is Beautiful.  And it says the cat walker has to get, got to be street legal in Spain.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Here's what, no, we're not making fun of retards.  We're letting them join the show.  In response to Madrid's banning of microscopic models from its fashion week, Gene Paul Goodyear 
[00:54:30]  marched this plus sign stunner in the Paris ready-to-wear show.  How did you ever make an arrest?  Did a criminal have to throw himself in your arms wearing those burglar, like dark burglar  glasses?  Do you think he was speaking at all or just had his nightstick out, just beating him senseless?  There was no honor in weapons.  I used my hands.  Oh, you just used it.  No honor in weapons.  He says that without a hitch.  You know, he said that a few times. 
[00:55:00]  I thought you said there was no honor in weapons.  The nightstick is an extension of myself.  Well, we have someone very angry on feedback.  You suck.  That's the name of the person from New York City.  Oh.  Because they're too scared to use their real names.  They write, I hope your kids have lobster hands.  Oh.  That'd be handy.  So that'd be handy.  Bring them in a cage and just have some laughs.  If you're hungry, all I would give them every Christmas was nutcrackers.  They play with these. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, if I had a kid with lobster hands, I'd make them take up the flute.  How do you like them apples?  That's right.  That's what I would do.  Then parade them around and make money.  Throw some money in the jar.  And then I would try again and get a real kid.  And just have that one, you know, to make us all laugh during the holidays.  Thread this needle and you eat today.  That's right.  And then, of course, you know, if you suck had instant feedback again, you should have a small brain contest.  All right. 
[00:56:00]  Now he's getting funny.  And then dot, dot, dot.  He spells out the F word.  So it's you should have a small brain contest.  Dot, dot, dot.  F.  You'd win.  See, we assumed.  Thank you, Kenny.  I would win.  We assumed you suck.  Is that his name?  Yeah.  That by saying you should have a small brain contest, we made the assumption that you would  guess that we would win with our small brains.  Yeah.  We have very small brains. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  We get it.  This guy's clever, though.  Yeah.  Boy.  Just another faggot too scared to use his real name.  You never see where he's going.  Why do faggots not use your real name?  Maybe his real name is You Suck.  He's an Asian gentleman.  And that's why the anger.  Right.  You Suck.  What an ass.  Let's say hi to Dan in Chicago.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, little boy.  Hi, I'm Midge Me.  Hi, Midge Me.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Brendan from Providence.  Every meal at the Flipper Midget's house is like a pie eating contest. 
[00:57:00]  Okay, hands behind, back, and go.  I was flipping through the channels, and I saw that despite being voted second to last  by the judges on Dance with the Stars, Jerry Springer still won.  When are they going to acknowledge that we're trying to get Jerry Springer to win this whole  thing?  When are they going to acknowledge?  We had Jerry Springer on our show, what, about two weeks ago?  Yeah.  And we told Jerry we're going to try to make him win the whole thing.  Because he said he would acknowledge us if he won. 
[00:57:30]  And he begged us.  He goes, please don't do that.  My knees can't hold out.  I'm having a tough time with these dances.  He said he's terrible out there, and he knows it.  I had a good time, but it's time for me to leave the show.  And we said, no way.  And the O&A Pests are on it.  They're voting for Jerry Springer like crazy.  Like crazy.  He's winning, even though the judges vote against him.  50% of the decision to get their own off, 50% is the judges, and 50% is the audience vote.  Someone had a perfect score with the judges last night, and they got voted off. 
[00:58:00]  Because their votes from the public was not as high as Jerry Springer's.  So we're having a major effect on Dancing with the Stars.  A major effect, and they're not acknowledging it yet for some reason.  No, they won't.  Jerry will if he wins.  Yeah.  That's what he said.  Any better.  Or else he won't be dancing anymore for anybody.  What are we going to threaten with?  He'll have his legs broken.  We'll send retards to watch his show in studio.  I'll break his legs.  So that's pretty cool, right?  He's still in it. 
[00:58:30]  You're born at ABC.com.  Kenny should watch putting those glasses on on a sunny day.  His hair could burst into flames.  Glasses working like a magnifying glass.  One second on that hair of his.  He was looking down as he was reading something, and I'm just looking at that dry dew and his little pointy nose in those glasses,  and I just wished I could kick the shit out of the eye.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy thought it was 9 o'clock already.  That's great.  Jimmy cursing. 
[00:59:00]  The first thing that I noticed is that his eyes are a little bit too close together.  Yeah.  It's called beady eyes.  He's got the cop beady eyes.  He used to be a cop.  Right.  So he looks like a cop.  I bet his feet, as flat as manila envelopes on the bottom.  Just complete flat foot.  I bet there's gum on the bottom of his shoes.  You know what Kenny is?  He's like a Doberman pincher because he has a little head.  I can't say his brain is too big for his head, but maybe it is, and that's why he's like, 
[00:59:30]  you know, Dobermans are vicious because their brains are apparently too big for their heads.  Is that it?  That's what I've heard.  Gives him a headache?  Yeah.  Just constantly mad.  He's got those predatorial eyes, though, which is good.  Very close together.  Good look.  You know, they're not on the side of his head like a fish.  What's up with the sport jacket in the morning?  I don't know.  I think it's to show some type of authority or responsibility or something.  I can't imagine why at this hour anyone would have to have a sport jacket on.  Is that every day, the sport jacket?  Every day.  Ever have the little elbow things on there? 
[01:00:00]  Like his writer?  Yeah, the Professor Patches.  My memoirs.  Can't even spell that right.  Memoirs.  Memoirs.  Memoirs.  Went to work today.  Got G.H. his cereal.  It was a good day.  Carp DM.  Hey, guys.  You suck is back.  Oh, boy.  He's got a little attention and he's happy. 
[01:00:30]  He's still trying.  He thinks this one's going to get to us.  You sound like Howard again.  Oh, God, dude.  Are you having a major effect on Dancing with the Stars like he has an effect on everything?  Like everything?  Come on, you guys.  Come on.  Get some new material.  Hey, you suck.  When you're on top of your wife and you're looking her in the eyes, do you use your real  name or do you hide like you do when you send instant feedbacks, you pussy?  I hate the little anonymous faggots.  Give a real name or call, you know? 
[01:01:00]  What's the number to get in touch with us?  Yeah, we don't give out the number ever.  We don't give out the number enough.  For us, 1-866-313-FREE.  There you go.  Now, call and be a man and face us.  Take your medicine.  Hey, let's say hi to Frank Caliendo officially.  Of course.  You flew all night from what, L.A.?  Phoenix.  I moved to Phoenix.  Did you move to Phoenix?  I have two kids now.  Life is different.  What?  What happened to you?  Well, you know, no more late night whoring for me. 
[01:01:30]  I mean, congratulations is what I should be saying.  No, no, no.  I mean, my life is the same as it was.  And Phoenix is good.  Were you in the mob?  No, I couldn't stand in L.A. anymore.  It just was terrible.  And, you know, once we had the kids that had decided that, you know, I didn't want to  raise them in L.A., so we just moved out to Phoenix.  And it's just a lot.  Then, you know, we moved out to Phoenix for it to be safer.  And as we do that, there's two serial killers running loose.  Yeah, but what are the odds?  Well, serial killers.  Well, right.  They're on show time. 
[01:02:00]  It's a little excitement.  And it's not like a big city where, you know, you get clunked over the head with a cinder block  by some homeless guy.  That's scarier than a serial killer anyway.  You're fine as long as they're not going after Impressionists.  So, don't worry about it.  Who's that guy who does Madden?  Right.  I saw your head.  I just kill Impressionists.  That would be a great serial killer.  I'm like a Impressionist bit.  So, I'm doing my John Madden.  And I'm over here, and I'm doing this, and I'm doing that, and then boom.  There's a saw going through my head.  I mean, I mean, that's the old Madden eating a sentence thing. 
[01:02:30]  Like, hey, that predicate tastes better than the subject right there.  Put a little prepositional phrase on there.  Boom.  You got a sharp sentence.  He's the cookie monster of grammar.  It's like if he had those eyes that Cookie Monster had, though, they'd get stuck in his  eyebrows like, oh, I'm looking at two different directions at the same time.  By the way, when I run on the jokes, it's just that.  That's all you need to do.  Frank, I think about you all the time because John Madden walks around my neighborhood in 
[01:03:00]  between games.  Oh, really?  I guess he lives up there during the football season.  Yeah, he lives in that famous building.  Dakota?  The Dakota.  He does live there?  Yeah.  Because I've been trying to figure out where he lives because I see him in the hood all  the time.  The hood.  The hood.  The Upper West Side.  It's now the hood.  But he's only there during football season, which I find weird.  I never see him in the summer.  Because I think he works out of there for the football season.  Doesn't he take the Madden Cruiser to the various locations that he has to be?  The Outback State Cruiser. 
[01:03:30]  That's what it is.  The Outback State Cruiser.  Is it?  Yeah.  It used to be called the Madden Cruiser, but now it's sponsored.  Oh, yeah.  Of course it is.  Why wouldn't it be?  Because he's afraid to fly.  Always what I heard is that he's claustrophobic.  So he can get out of a car, but he can't get out of, or a bus or something like that,  but he can't get out of, you know, a plane in the midair.  I think he just loses it in the bus every so often and pull over and just kind of has  to get out.  I've heard that.  I've heard that they will.  Like in the desert somewhere. 
[01:04:00]  I am done.  You've got to stop.  Son of a bitch.  What is going on?  Hold on.  And I heard like he'll drink like a six pack of beer or something.  I don't know if that's true, but I heard that.  Yeah.  He'll just have to down some beer.  Okay, let's go.  Daddy's ready.  Come on.  Let me drive.  Big bus weaving down the road.  Oh, yeah.  To the left, to the right.  Look out.  Listen.  There's a midget with tiny hands.  I'm going to eat him.  Yeah.  What a kook.  He walks around the neighborhood and he's just miserable. 
[01:04:30]  Always on his cell phone.  Walks really slow.  Just a...  Well, you don't picture John Madden being like a speed walker.  No, he looks like a grouch though, man.  Or a happy guy clicking his heels up and down.  Feeling good about myself.  Feeling carefree.  Yeah.  Speed walking.  He just walks...  Where's the mall?  I want to get around here.  Lose a couple pounds.  Walks really slow.  Never happy.  Wearing a Let's Get Physical headband.  Looks like an oversized...  Like a warmers.  Oversized leprechaun.  You know that he hates me.  He literally...  Does he really?  Oh, yeah.  Man hates me with a passion. 
[01:05:00]  Ever since years ago when Kimmel took those...  When Kimmel was doing the segments on the pregame show and he brought me on and took  the pair of hedge clippers to the Madden eyebrows.  Yeah.  And the next day Madden had his eyebrow shaved.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  He cleaned them up.  You know, you got a little trim right there.  But my manager went up to him at the Super Bowl a couple of years ago and went, what do  you think of the guy who knows the great John Madden?  I'm fresh.  He's like, I don't like it.  What do you mean you don't like it?  I don't like it.  I should have been Shrek.  He didn't say the Shrek thing.  But that's probably why he hates me. 
[01:05:30]  He'd be perfect as Shrek, wouldn't he?  I mean, you got a donkey that sounds like Eddie Murphy over there and a gingerbread man  right there.  I mean, the gingerbread man is the only guy I know who's made out of the same thing as  his house.  I mean, you can eat your house and you're probably not a cannibal.  I mean, the gingerbread man, the bright fire of a Shrek world right there.  Such a freak.  Yeah, he does not enjoy that.  Some people really don't like when you do impressions of them, I guess.  Especially if you're on Mad TV doing impressions.  I think it's more okay if you're on Saturday Night Live doing it because then all of a 
[01:06:00]  sudden it's iconic and then, you know, and Mad TV.  Yeah, you really do it mean-spiritedly.  You know, they're having fun over there.  You people are just mean.  Yeah, there is something like that.  Like SNL, it's really a weird thing.  It's, you know, Mad TV.  The only guy that ever liked me doing an impression of him on Mad TV was Rod Roddy who passed away  now.  But you remember that in front of the Price is Right?  Come on now!  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You're the next contestant on The Price is Right.  And the joke we did there the first time that he, like, communicated with Mad TV was we 
[01:06:30]  did, Mike McDonald was playing Bob Barker.  He's like, you better go on for a little while, Rod Roddy.  Great to have you back.  Thanks, Bob.  Of all the guys at that rest stop, who knew it was the sheriff's son?  That's the joke we did.  And he wrote back, or his publicist wrote, Rod really likes this.  I bet he does.  Of course he does.  I bet he did.  It's fantastic.  And I read his publicist letters in his voice, apparently. 
[01:07:00]  Here's a guy who didn't realize that he was doing the wrong voice for the wrong person.  I mean, it happens sometimes.  Frank, by the way, I'm a huge YouTube fan.  And you're one of the top...  That Bush, the Bush Clinton bit that I did on Letterman.  I'm actually doing a thing on Letterman tonight.  He's got one of the top comedy bits on YouTube.  Yeah.  The thing that, the fact that Clinton could lie his way out of anything, look you directly  in the eyes and get away with it, be like, I am not here. 
[01:07:30]  You do not see me.  I don't know what it is you're looking at, but it is not me.  What is here?  Isn't here just there without a T?  Ladies, I love you.  But Bush, I mean, he tries a lot, but he can't.  He's got, like, truthful threats or something like that.  If the Monica Lewinsky scandal happened to Bush, no way he gets out of it.  Put him on the stand.  Mr. President, you have relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky?  Uh, what did they tell me to say here?  That was out loud, wasn't it?  I cannot believe I said that.  There's two kinds of words.  Inside words and outside words. 
[01:08:00]  Inside words stay in.  Outside words come out that time.  An inside word popped out.  That was pretty good, man.  Goodification.  He's the only president who can answer a question like a 17-year-old girl, too.  Whatever.  Whatever, whatever.  Talk to the fist because the hand don't exist.  Boom.  Gotcha.  You got to duck-a-ficate, man.  Get your head down.  Weeble-wobble-bobble-bobble.  You know what I'm saying?  Go for it, my friends.  I love that.  That swagger.  The little lean he does on the podium. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, it looks like he's from the Old West.  Yeah, yeah.  Like leaning on the bar for a drink.  Yeah.  Give me a whiskey.  Because I'm ready to presidentialize, man.  Walking around with the spurs on.  Cha-ching.  Cha-ching.  Trying to trick himself.  Cha-ching.  Cha-ching.  I'm going to kick some ass.  He does.  He leans there.  He just points at the reporter.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, you.  Yeah.  You're a blind guy.  I could care less if you're really blind. 
[01:09:00]  Is the sun out?  That is really good.  Did you hear?  Did you ever?  You saw that.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  The blind guy.  Why?  Why are you wearing those glasses, man?  Is the big ball of hot gases out?  You know, Mr. President, he's blind. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, well, I guess my approval rating is disapproved a little bit.  But at all.  That was a great moment.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  Frank Caliendo in studio today.  What were you promoting, Frank?  I'm doing something on Letterman tonight.  Very nice.  The other thing is, you know, I've wanted to get in here forever, and it's just been out  on the West Coast.  And I get a lot of emails from people saying, hey, you've got to call O&A, call O&A.  But I always hate those crappy, you know, sometimes it's just crappy phone calls, and 
[01:10:00]  you're like, hey, I'm going to be in, you know, wherever.  And it feels like just a plug with nothing.  So I'm like, I've got to come in, you know.  Yeah, the phone call thing is a little rough.  Sometimes the phone can be good, though, if you've been on the show a lot and you've, you  know, interacted and stuff like that a lot.  But it's been a long time since I've talked to you guys.  By the way, I'm going to be in Chicago in a couple weeks.  And there's a guy who knows how to almost work it in.  But he made it a little awkward.  Chicago Improv.  I mean, there he did it again.  I mean, I would eat that mother fruiter.  Frank, take us a break as John Madden.  You know, I mean, the virus is spreading. 
[01:10:30]  I mean, I can feel it going through different parts of my body.  One of them I can say on XM.  One of them I can't say here.  And then, boom.  We'll be back on the flip side, yo.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're hanging with Frank Caliendo this morning on the Opie and Anthony Show.  He's going to be on Letterman tonight.  Hopefully, you'll be doing some Al Pacino.  Maybe.  Huh?  How's that sound?  How's that first set up?  Come on.  Talking off the air. 
[01:11:00]  We didn't get into it on the air.  But maybe we will.  You never know.  You never understand.  One of my favorite sketches I ever did at Mad TV, and there were like three over five years.  There's a guy who has a little bit of bitterness.  Been there?  I understand what you're talking about.  But we did this thing.  Will Sass and I did Al Pacino and Robert De Niro going for ice cream.  Oh, I remember that one.  That was a great bit.  Yeah.  Like, 31 flavors to choose from?  This is going to be tough. 
[01:11:30]  What about mint chocolate chip?  You like that?  I like mint, but I don't like chocolate.  Especially when it's in the form of little chips.  Come on!  He yells for no reason.  What happened to him?  Over the years.  He's screaming.  And that's why somebody should cast him as a librarian.  Just to see what he'd do.  Because you know he's going to start screaming.  Everybody's like, shush him.  Shh.  Where's the B section?  Shh.  Where is the B section?  Shh.  And what the hell is the Dewey Decimal System?  It's a system created by a guy named Decimal, you dang dog. 
[01:12:00]  Come on, man.  Think of that.  Brainificate.  What do you think about Robert Williams?  Rehab?  He's out now?  Well, if you'd seen RV and you were in it, you'd probably be there too.  You know what I'm saying?  Come on.  Play along.  Grow a beard.  Get serious.  You know what I'm saying?  That's what it is.  Bring it down.  It doesn't matter if the show's brought down with energy, because usually I'm doing five  different things at once.  It's the Robert Williams Theory of Comedy.  If you don't have a joke, just switch voices.  And we dance and we're back.  See, that's what Frank does.  He does it.  You always need a joke when the voice changes. 
[01:12:30]  It becomes...  You know what I'm saying?  I do know what you're saying.  Zaki's eating a sentence there.  I heard that before.  Okay, come on.  Somebody's going to regurge.  Let me do it.  You know what I'm saying?  How many times are you going to say you know what I'm saying?  Damn, that is really spot on.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, we should promote the fact that Matthew Modine is going to be in this studio in like  15 minutes, 20 minutes, man.  We haven't said anything?  Yeah.  Matthew Modine will be on the show today at 8 o'clock. 
[01:13:00]  I didn't know Frank was here until I...  What?  What?  Hey!  Wow!  There he is!  Of course it is.  Oh, you want to just check out the show?  Just have him come in.  He can't wait.  It's Matthew Modine.  Of course.  Sorry, Frank.  I just didn't realize how regular I am.  Sorry, Frank.  I waited for an hour.  Frank waited for an hour.  Matthew Modine is...  Hello, Matthew.  Is Wes right in.  Nice to see you. 
[01:13:30]  How you doing?  Take a seat.  Get comfy.  I thought Al Pacino was in the building.  I'm here.  Is that great?  Matty.  How you doing, my friend?  I'm doing good, buddy.  It's good to see you.  It's been a while.  Frank's going to be on Letterman tonight.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doing something odd.  It's a very weird thing.  You're doing something odd?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know if I should...  I'd watch it because it's going to be...  I've never done anything like it before.  Ooh.  Intriguing.  I don't think...  Well, I shouldn't say I've never.  Letterman's never done anything.  I don't think he has. 
[01:14:00]  I mean...  So he has you doing something different than a normal appearance.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  You're not going to reenact some kind of Senator Foley thing, are you?  I've never done this before.  What if John Madden were Senator Foley?  I want to, you know...  Hey, just don't read this out loud.  Frank doesn't know where he could go with it, so he cut himself off.  Censorship is what it's all about, my friends.  Oh, I'm loving the Foley stuff, man.  Mark Foley is...  So was he.  Yeah, of course.  Until he got caught.  Apparently so.  Well, we can't just leave Matthew here to sit. 
[01:14:30]  I'm enjoying being a passive watcher.  Yeah?  Just sitting.  Just sitting, drinking his coffee.  It's like, ah, come on.  This is Full Metal Jacket Week on the Opie and Anthony show.  I heard you had Arlie Ermey on.  Yeah.  He was great, man.  He is a boy.  Jimmy's really bummed because he's a huge fan, and he was in Pittsburgh doing comedy.  Pittsburgh.  I missed Arlie Ermey because I was doing Pittsburgh.  It was really awful.  Had him on for an hour, of course.  You know he can talk.  I mean, imagine him as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman with a chainsaw in his hands. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  I saw the commercial.  He is just perfect for that role.  Oh, yeah.  Perfect.  He took me out of it, though.  I saw the first one.  I'm like, that's Arlie Ermey.  It's like, it's Hartman.  I couldn't watch him in the first one.  I've seen him in so many other things, though, that it doesn't bother me to see him in another  role.  He's a good actor.  Yeah, yeah.  He's definitely good.  He was great in Dead Man Walking.  Dead Man Walking.  He played the father of the girl that I murdered.  So he's done other things where I could watch him in anything.  It was horror. 
[01:15:30]  It was weird to see him in a horror film.  Yeah.  No, Lee's got some chops.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's pretty candid, too.  He was going off about his father.  His father.  His father family.  Like, you know, how they didn't really get along.  We basically said, tell us about the movie, and we went to a place like, wow, how did  we get here?  We're like, so do you get along with your father?  He goes, no, I hate him.  He basically said he hates his father.  He does enjoy talking.  Which is very cool, because you let him talk forever.  But, man, I saw you guys. 
[01:16:00]  It was, man, you, D'Onofrio, over at the BAM Center over there in Brooklyn a couple of  years back.  You were doing a screening, a full middle jacket, and then a question-answer thing  at the end.  Q&A.  And I was sitting there, and I was kind of joking last night with my girlfriend going,  I don't have to raise my hand now to ask him a question.  Oh, you could just sit here.  Look at this.  I'm on the stage with you.  He's got to just answer it.  He's just got to answer the question now.  But that was really interesting, like, that you guys did that.  It was. 
[01:16:30]  Went out, small screenings.  It was the first time that we had really spoken about the movie since we made the movie.  Yeah.  The two of us to sit.  Yeah.  Because there wasn't, you know, like.  It didn't have the press junket kind of thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It didn't really have the cult following that it does now.  So to do it at the time, I guess nobody was asking.  But now it has such a cult following, people want to know so much about it that they had  a small screening there.  It was a couple hundred people.  And then Q&A with you and Vincent D'Onofrio. 
[01:17:00]  And it was great.  It's just really insightful, funny.  He's a good guy.  Yeah.  What's the number one question they ask you about the movie that you're just almost sick  of answering?  The first question that everybody asks, what was Stanley like?  Really?  Yeah.  What was Stanley like?  Everyone's got their own little interpretation of what Stanley was like, I think.  I kept a diary while I was making the picture, and you have it.  You have it.  Yeah.  And, you know.  I have it right here.  Look at Jimmy.  I have it.  And a gun.  I never had any intention of publishing a personal diary. 
[01:17:30]  But so much time has gone by, and it has a whole life of its own, you know.  So it's kind of a wonderful thing, because Stanley Kubrick was such an amazing filmmaker,  to be able to, as a piece of history, you know, as a kind of document of what it was  like to be a kid going to work with this incredible filmmaker, and just a little chink  in the wall to be able to have a peek at him.  Yeah.  But I think that he'd be really proud of the book.  I wanted the book to have some integrity, some, you know, something, because he was 
[01:18:00]  so fastidious about everything he did, that I wanted the book to be something, if he held  in his hands, that he would really love and appreciate.  What made you keep a diary?  Like, most people aren't that insightful, like, hey, this is going to be.  I was playing a journalist.  You know, I was out of acting school, and, you know, you think, okay, what do I have to  do?  You know, let me get into my role, man.  Wow, what a great thing, though, you know.  He probably does it before he came in today.  Oh, yeah.  You put on your Al Pacino underwear, your Frank Madden shirt. 
[01:18:30]  Frank Madden.  Is that my life?  Did you get that?  Doesn't matter.  Is that what people call me?  Frank Madden.  That is 90% of my life.  Aren't you a Frank Madden?  What do you put on to become Bush?  He does the greatest Bush.  No one does a better Bush than Frank Caliendo.  No, man, it's like a, like it got stung by a bee and had an allergic reaction, man.  Face puffed up.  That's some bad shellfish, you know. 
[01:19:00]  I enjoy, you know, a for me tall jacay.  You know.  He gets the face going, too.  He's got the same mouth.  You know, it's what it is.  And when I say what it is, I don't mean, you know, that saying from the 70s, what Raj would  say to Dwayne on what's happening.  I mean, what it is, actually, you know.  Jesus Christ.  It's really creepy.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  So, these guys are FCC approved. 
[01:19:30]  Well, thank you.  Sort of.  Finally.  Well, whatever.  Thanks for that stamp of approval, Mr. President.  Yeah, well, FCC does have a couple letters in it.  You can't, a word you can't say.  No global warming in this studio.  No.  No global warming anywhere.  I don't know where you've been, man.  It's cold out.  There's no global warmification.  Al Gore is nuts.  He's in the cuckoo tree. 
[01:20:00]  He lives up there with a couple of monkey people, you know, just swinging from the trees, talking  about a heat wave.  I mean, it's truly ridiculified.  Someone asked us yesterday, I got an email about us going to Chicago.  Yeah, they want us in Chicago.  They want us in Chicago in December.  And I said, how long does Al Gore say it's going to take for this global warming to kick  in?  Because if it's under two months, I'm out. 
[01:20:30]  I'm not going to Chicago in the winter.  Chicago is disgusting in August.  Yeah.  That's fall.  Al Gore's crazy, man.  He is.  Global warming.  He said this internet thing would be big.  Now that's happening.  It's a fad, right?  It's ridiculous.  I mean, the environment is still here.  Look around you.  You know, we're all in our habitat, living inside the middle of the environment.  It's not going anywhere.  We don't live on Mars or some... 
[01:21:00]  You're very smart, Mr. Bush.  I've been working out mentally.  Have you?  Yeah.  Books and book-like things.  Whatever.  I don't know.  I kind of doubt you read those books that the White House spokespeople say that you...  Books on tape.  ...that you're reading.  Oh, it's books on tape.  Books on CD.  Books on DVD so you see the pictures, too.  Slideshow on DVD.  Oh, man.  Isn't books on DVD just really a movie? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, but not as good.  I came up with something for that.  That's so creepy.  It really is.  Anyway, Matthew Modine.  Yes.  Can I say this, too?  I noticed I got still pictures taken of me, but the movie camera came out for him.  Well, duh.  Yeah, I'm just saying.  I'm just...  You know, you just realize your place.  Not that it's wrong.  I'm okay with it.  I just...  It's funny to me that...  Frank waited an hour.  You waited 15 seconds. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  He gets the still pictures, and Matthew Modine gets the movie camera.  Yes.  I found that the key...  Yes.  I found that the key is just get on the other side of the glass so they see you.  But I probably would have...  They'd be like, oh, Frank's here.  He's coming on, and...  Oh, no.  I got a button for a shade that goes right down.  It's when you come up to the glass, and you've been in a movie we've seen 500 times,  and still watch it again.  I was watching it the other night.  After Early Army came in, I was so depressed I missed it.  I just had to put it on for a little while.  Yeah.  And one of my favorite scenes is when after you blanket party pile, just when you're listening 
[01:22:30]  to him cry, the hands over the ears.  What a great shot that is.  Creepy.  Yeah, really creepy.  The little, like, bluish-gray lighting, and you're just covering your ears.  Was that a lot of Kubrick, or was that you just, you know, I don't want to have you have  to say, I'm a genius, and I was doing everything like that, but did he really help you with  that role?  Was he very hands-on with what you did in that, or...?  No.  No?  No.  It was pretty much...  Hey, go ahead, guys.  My favorite direction I ever got from Stanley was, uh, Matthew, you're not going to do it 
[01:23:00]  that way, are you?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So, I mean, you do it hundreds of times, I mean, over and over and over again, and so  then you'd try something different, and he'd say, what was that?  You did it differently that time.  I said, well, yeah, you didn't like the last 20, so I thought I'd try something different.  And I never said I didn't like the last 20.  Oh, man, how intimidating is that?  Why are we doing 22, then?  And he's, you know, because I'm, I don't know. 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  Would you just start sweating?  Yeah.  Because I can't imagine, like, the intimidation of Kubrick saying something like that to me.  How intimidating, man.  Wow.  What was the hardest scene?  Like, what was the most takes in the scene you did in that entire film?  Because there's, like, legendary stories about him and Scatman Crothers in The Shining,  trying to get that one shot, you know, where he did, like, 80 takes.  You know, they would erase the slate so you wouldn't have that number.  So we didn't measure things in numbers of takes.  We'd measure things in numbers of days, you know, so there. 
[01:24:00]  Wow.  At the wall there where, when we were about to send 8-Ball into the town where he gets shot by the sniper,  at that wall, we were at the wall for a month.  A month.  Yeah.  That's an independent film.  A month.  That scene where all you guys are laid out.  Yeah, you're under the wall, taking cover.  Yeah.  A month.  A month.  I come up to Cowboy.  Jesus.  I come up to Cowboy.  They're looking at the map, and I say, what's the matter?  We lost, and he tells me to shut up.  From that point to when we make that movement into the square was a month. 
[01:24:30]  And how long was that on film, would you say?  I think it might be three minutes of film.  How long did the whole film?  It's a lot like that on Saturday night, isn't it?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah, I once did three takes.  John Madden popcorn bit.  That is almost unjustifiable if it wasn't Stanley Kubrick.  Yeah.  Arliss Howard, who played Cowboy, said, I don't care if this is the greatest scene in the history  of film.  I will curse this scene until I die. 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  How long did the whole film take?  Just for continuity reasons, that's ridiculous.  Like, was your hair longer at the end of the scene?  You know what?  It was wintertime.  We were filming in London.  That was a place called Becton Gasworks.  And there was breath coming out of our face.  So they got those big football heaters.  They look like jet engines on the sidelines.  But they're too noisy.  So you can't record sound.  So they get that flex duct, aluminum, shiny stuff. 
[01:25:30]  And they put the things really, really far away.  And then put the duct work in our faces blowing hot air.  Now, Mr. Bush would know this, that if you superheat air with gas, what's going to come  out the other end is going to be carbon...  Mono or dio?  Dio.  Dio.  Carbon dioxide.  So you got...  Oh, that wasn't what I was going on.  Yeah, 100 yards of flex ducts with hot air blowing carbon dioxide in your face.  And we couldn't figure out why people were passing out and losing their voices and getting 
[01:26:00]  sick to their stomach.  You know?  Wow.  I suggested that it might be the carbon dioxide blowing in our faces.  And don't be silly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't be silly.  Well, that is amazing.  A month.  Yeah.  Oof.  And the whole movie took what?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't say why we had the jets.  It was because we had frost coming out of our mouths.  Yeah.  So we tried to hide it.  Because it's supposed to be Vietnam, right?  Yeah.  It's not going to be very chilly on a Vietnam day.  You know, you're wearing combat fatigues and there's snow on the ground. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  So it was in a jungle.  Yeah, that'd be a problem.  Look a little silly.  It wasn't good.  Was it an eight-month shoot, the whole thing?  I was in England for almost two years.  Oh.  Yeah, from start to finish.  When did you know?  The actual filming was about, like, if you put day to day, if you put them back to back,  it was probably 10 months.  Lee Ermey got in a horrible car accident.  He was out in the biggest forest in the world, a place called Epping Forest.  And he's around Christmas time looking for Chinese takeout.  We don't know what he was really doing out there in the forest. 
[01:27:00]  But he got in a car accident and the steering wheel trapped him into the car.  His chest was crushed.  And so he was really suffering through that whole boot camp thing because he had to, you know,  imagine saying all that stuff and you got broken ribs.  And then his throat started bleeding.  And then they brought a doctor in and started spraying some kind of steroids in his throat so that he could speak.  Wow.  Just made him angrier.  And then he starts yelling, you got a combination of cigarettes, coffee, blood, and now some frightening steroid thing, you know. 
[01:27:30]  And he's getting in your face going, what's your major malfunction?  You know, and, you know, spittle all over your face.  And it's just like, just hit me, please.  And, you know, let's get this over with.  Wow.  What was the, what was, like, the order of the filming?  Did it, I'm sure it didn't go exactly like that.  No, we did all the Vietnam stuff and then came back and did the boot camp.  First and then did the boot camp.  Lee Ermey was hired to be the technical advisor on the film.  Yeah.  He wasn't, he wasn't, he wasn't meant to be the actor.  And, you know, he was auditioning extras. 
[01:28:00]  And when Stanley saw how, how fantastic he was auditioning people and just kind of making stuff up,  that it would be foolish not to use somebody with such a tremendous talent.  I said that was amazing when he was, when he was in, just that one shot, you know, without a cut.  Him rambling through his speech at the beginning, just going around the, the guys in the barracks without a cut.  He worked hard.  I mean, he worked really, really hard at that. 
[01:28:30]  That's rough.  We, uh, me and Opie know, um, having filmed our television commercial.  That's right, Andy.  Having to say three words.  And there's eight billion outtakes on a gag reel for three words.  I can imagine, uh, Arlie Ermey walking around like that and saying so much dialogue in, in one, you know, in a Kubrick shot.  So I can only imagine how many times he got it right.  But, you know, maybe something went out of focus for a second and had to be, be done all over again.  Arliss Howard, uh, used to joke that he had a butt plate in his head. 
[01:29:00]  I don't know if you can swear on this.  You can do whatever you want.  They'll figure it out down the hall.  Yeah, they'll figure it out down the hall.  There's a line in the film where he says, uh, you're the kind of guy to fuck a guy in the ass and not even have the goddamn courtesy to give him a reach around.  Right.  Um.  I'm pretty sure that one's not okay.  Mr. Bush.  Thank you, Mr. Bush.  I'll check with it.  Thank you.  I will let you.  It's just going to make me very happy to read later on that Matthew Modine got dumped out on our show.  Yeah.  Dump sheet.  That's pretty cool.  Mr. Bush is here. 
[01:29:30]  There won't be any fines in place.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of the dump report, my friends.  But, but yeah, that came out of nowhere.  Lee Ermey went up.  He didn't know where he was.  He didn't know what lines he was supposed to say.  And it just kind of, uh, you know, that just came out.  And we, you, you try to get a mental picture of what it was that he just said while you're standing there at attention.  And then you realize what it was.  And man, yeah, how do you just not laugh your ass off?  Hey, when, when did you know you were going to be in a classic? 
[01:30:00]  When did it hit you?  Did it hit you during the filming or when it started getting reviewed?  No.  I, you know, you don't know something like that till four years after it's come out.  Right, right.  I mean, uh, cause films, I mean, go, go back and look at Rocky.  Rocky was one of the most inspirational, fantastic films ever.  And it's a classic, but you go back and look at it now and it, and it, it, it, it, it, it's like pasted together really poorly.  I don't know if it's because Sylvester Stallone became Sylvester Stallone or, I mean, but you loved Rocky. 
[01:30:30]  I mean, him swallowing those eggs and da, da, da, da, da.  Yeah.  And you go back and look at that film and it's, it's, it's, uh, it doesn't work.  I preferred Pauly throwing the turkey out the window.  He's fantastic in it.  I was always partial to the pet shop scene.  Another one I missed when he came in, Burt Young.  Burt Young, yeah.  I was part two.  Oh, was it?  Yeah, when she drops the feed bag, falls face first.  One of my favorite actors ever, who I still feel should be doing the same role, just entire films by himself, is the old Colonel. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, that's some kind of sick joke.  Please tell me you'd just talk to him all the time.  All I'd want to do is just talk to him.  Yeah.  I don't, that guy, you couldn't talk to him.  He was, he was, uh, maybe he's what they call one of those method actors, you know?  Oh, really?  Yeah, he was, he was a Colonel, was a Colonel, was a Colonel.  There was no talking to him.  Come on in for the big win.  Yeah.  Jimmy, do the Gord line.  All I've ever asked for my Marines to obey my orders is they would the word of God. 
[01:31:30]  God.  Oh, he was the greatest.  I would just want to, I want to take a trip with him and just let him talk to me and take  the rules.  Yeah, when that came out, I guess, was that the same year as Platoon or?  I think 87 was the same.  No, 87.  87, yeah, because I think Platoon came out 85, yeah.  85?  Yeah.  So I remember there was, was there another movie that came out that was kind of, Hamburger  Hill, that was it, that came out, um, and people were kind of comparing the two.  Remember that one, but, um.  Oh, we know who won that battle. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And the most famous line out of the film, probably, is the, is the, is the, uh, the hooker.  I mean, the most famous single line is Meets on Hawaii.  Oh, my God.  The two live crew song.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.  I mean, she was just a, just what, just a, was she like a regular chick?  She wasn't like an actress, was she?  That was probably the first rap song that crossed over into, into white America.  Yeah.  Oh, me so horny.  Everyone knew the line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She was, she was a character.  There's a whole, there's a whole chapter devoted to her in my book.  Really? 
[01:32:30]  Really.  Okay.  Too beaucoup.  Too beaucoup.  Fantastic.  Well, love to talk about your past forever, but, uh, what are you doing?  What you, what you working on?  I'm in here today to, to encourage, uh, every New Yorker, because I don't think it's opening  across the country.  It's just three, three theaters in the United, in, in, in New York, uh, a film called Kettle  of Fish with Gina Gershon, who, um, who's quite extraordinary in her own life.  The lovely Gina Gershon.  The lovely Gina Gershon, yeah. 
[01:33:00]  She got a pretty mouth, doesn't she?  She certainly does.  What's the movie about?  Uh, it's a, you know, it's not a movie that we haven't seen before.  It's, it's a, a story about a guy trying to fall in love, trying to make a commitment,  trying to, you know, he's a jazz musician, he's a player, you know, a different  girl every night, every weekend, and he decides that he's getting a little bit too old for  that, and maybe it's time to find a, a good girl and settle down, you know? 
[01:33:30]  And, uh, so what does he do?  He pursues a woman who's just got married, so that's, you know, something that would never  work, so he can say, well, I'm a loser, and I better go back to my old ways, and, um,  he sublets his apartment to Gina Gershon, and, and there comes the love story.  That, so, it's the same meat and potatoes, but it's a different gravy, and, and it's, it's,  it's a really charming, charming picture, and, and Gina Gershon is, is fun to, fun to  look at.  She's really funny in the movie.  Um, uh, it's, it was a real pleasure to work on it. 
[01:34:00]  There's a wonderful new actress, Christy, that's in it, that, uh, um, will excite a lot  of, uh, your young male audience, and, uh, and then there's Matthew Modine that you can  watch.  Of course.  Like, why is not, why is he not in a military movie?  It's weird not seeing you standing by a toilet with a rifle point catcher.  I watch little moments like that, because, you know, I've done a little acting, too,  and, uh, to watch, like, a real actor work, like, there's a scene where you're fixing 
[01:34:30]  his, uh, where you're getting, uh, D'Onofio ready, and you're just fixing his collar, and  you're not looking at him, and the, the loathing for him that you're giving off, and he picks  up on it and goes, you hate me, it's just so great.  I'm such an overacting ass, I would look at him and open my eyes and go, urgh, just  so I, like, I knew that I hated him.  Just not know what to do with your hands?  Yeah, I would just, you know, growl out of it, it was just so you could touch a real  actor, like, there's little weird moments, uh, just nice.  Yeah, D'Onofio is a, a, a guy that, um, like, everybody kind of knew him as that guy 
[01:35:00]  from that role when he started, um, I think he had done a couple of things beforehand, but  not anything really stand out like that.  Might have been his first role?  His first role.  They did Mystic Pizza, and, but he came out of that, and then got back into, I guess,  the shape he was in, and, uh, I remember watching, I guess it was Adventures in Babysitting,  and he played the Thor character, and I couldn't place who the hell that guy was, and for, for  the, the whole movie, I'm sitting there going, who is that guy?  Looks familiar, but he's, like, he, he had worked out, he was huge, he was all buff and 
[01:35:30]  everything.  And then Gutenberg put muscles on him.  Yeah, yeah, that's Howdy Doody with muscles.  Howdy Doody with muscles.  It was, it was, and then I'm like, oh my God.  It was Saturday Night Live that got one of those mus, mus, mus, musly bodies.  Who's what?  The, the, the guy that used to do Saturday Night, they put on.  Oh, Joe Piscopo.  Joe Piscopo.  Oh, God, yeah.  It's frightening.  That will, it's frightening when a comic kind of gets like that, like, um, Carrot Top  is, Carrot Top can kick anyone's ass.  What hex he has, that guy, what a body on him. 
[01:36:00]  I thought that was Carrot Top could kick your ass.  No, he's really, he's really like that.  I have a photo with him, and he's got his arm around me, and he has an open shirt, and  you can look in and see his chest muscles, and you have to look.  It's not right.  Oh, it's not.  It isn't.  Really bothers me.  I'm just thinking, if you're Carrot Top, you gotta be able to kick anyone's ass.  Of course, you're Carrot Top.  He's a big dude, too.  Yeah.  He's the real deal.  He's like 6'5 or something, isn't he?  No, he's tall.  I don't remember.  He's not that big, but he's...  Hey, before we let Matthew go, we gotta go to Jim in Massachusetts. 
[01:36:30]  A lot of people want to talk about this.  Hello, Jim.  What Jim's gonna say here.  Jim, go ahead.  Hey, um, Matthew Modine.  I'm like a, I'm a huge fan.  Full Metal Jacket was practically one of my inspirations for joining the Marines, and, uh, Jimmy  Norton, I'm just a huge fan.  You're fucking hilarious.  Thank you.  And the ONA virus is definitely spreading through mass.  You know, I mean, I listen every morning, and you guys are great.  What a, what a poignant call.  All-encompassing call. 
[01:37:00]  He wanted to say that Vision Quest is the best movie of all time.  Thank you.  There you go.  That's what he really wanted to say.  Does it bother you that Full Metal Jacket is the one?  I mean, that's obviously, I mean, you're in one of the, just such a classic, but is  that, like, as an artist, do you, like, uh, I kind of don't always talk about that movie.  I did other stuff.  No, no.  It's not like he was in the Brady Bunch.  No, but you know what I mean?  A lot of people don't like the United States part-by-one role.  I love the Memphis Belle.  Yeah.  But that was great.  No, it depends on where you go.  If you go to a, a, a, a Ranger game or a Yankee game, people, Vision Quest, you know, 
[01:37:30]  shoot.  Nobody wants to wrestle shoot.  And they know lines from the movies.  And you're a bleeder, Loudon.  You can't hold your mud.  So, I mean, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, you know, that and Memphis Belle and, uh, some  people, it's, it's Pacific Heights, you know, with Michael Keaton and that was a great movie.  That was a great movie.  Creepy movie.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  I forgot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You were the, uh, the husband.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  That was, he was a creep in that one.  Some people, and the band played on because it was such an important movie and, you know,  for making, helping people to realize that AIDS wasn't something that had a sexual preference. 
[01:38:00]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  And the band played on.  That was, and that was years ago, like, right when everybody started to get, uh, uh, recognition  of the whole thing.  Sure.  Yeah.  Hey, did D'Onofria and, uh, and, and, and Armie ever, like, eat lunch together?  Like, is there photos of them chit-chatting?  Because you can't picture those two exchanging a cordial word ever after only seeing them in  the film.  Were they, like, friendly off-camera?  I kind of remember during the, uh, interview you did after the movie that they didn't quite hit 
[01:38:30]  it off that well.  No, I don't, I don't think so.  No.  I mean, the only interchange that I remember Vince having with Lee Ermey was that, uh, in  the beginning, remember when Lee Ermey slaps me in the beginning of the movie?  Um, he kept slapping me and, you know, you don't want to slap somebody.  So it's like a miss and, and, uh, he, he had a shoulder problem.  So he would slap me and it would look like a miss.  And then, uh, you know, six out of 10 times he would slap me across the face and, and Stanley 
[01:39:00]  go, no, we got to go again.  It looked like a miss.  I said, no, he hit me, my teeth are loose.  And he goes, no, we got to go again.  And he goes, well, the angle doesn't work.  Let's change the angle.  And so we, then we did another day of filming with him slapping me from the other side.  So I got slapped in the face about two dozen times.  And, you know, the whole thing, the person who sells a punch is not the guy throwing the  punch, the guy taking the punch.  So you got to throw your head.  So my neck was killing me and, and I was whining about it.  And so when it came Vince's turn, when he says, uh, you know, what side of your face 
[01:39:30]  is that your left?  And what side of your face is that my right?  Cause he can't remember his right from his left.  So Vince remembered how many days it took to get that with me.  And so he just went over to Lee and he said, look, I want you to slap me across the face  and I want you to slap me really good because I want it to be over with.  And then he went into Kubrick and said, I want him to slap me.  And then Lee Ermey went over to Stanley and said, listen, he wants me to slap him.  He goes, yeah, slap him. 
[01:40:00]  And so when Vince gets slapped in the movie, he gets slapped so hard his hat spins around  on his head, but it, but it was over, you know, they, he, he slaps.  You only had to take one good one.  You can really tell too.  That was a dead on slap in the face.  There was no way to fake that.  And that horrible slap that you go, oh, that's going to leave a mark.  D'Onofrio's reaction too is more than just acting.  Like he's holding in actual pain and delivering his line.  Vince looks actually like, like he got slapped by his father and is about to start crying. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Probably peed a little bit.  I always thought the best slap ever was a kiss of death.  Richard Widmark.  Do you remember, you ever see that where he slaps the little fat man in the face?  He says the kitchen's closed and his hand is so sleek and he crisply slaps the other  man across the face.  And then I saw that and I'm like, no, that's got to take first price.  No, it was, it was when, uh, De Niro and, and, uh, uh, De Niro and Chris Walken and,  and, uh, so wow, you know, so wow. 
[01:41:00]  Oh God.  Oh my God.  You're on her.  Yeah.  Oh man.  Crazy slap.  Yeah.  He just, he's just getting more and more pissed with each slap.  I'm going to play Russian roulette.  Yeah.  Now that'll piss you off.  Well, we got to get Matthew out of here.  He's got, uh, you got interviews all day.  They're saying we got you to right about now.  Yeah.  This was fun.  Oh man.  I didn't want to leave.  Couldn't have been happier to have you.  It's not like doing radio.  It's like coming over to some guy's house.  That's what we try to do.  It's hanging.  Yeah.  It's a hang.  We try to do a hang.  Unfortunately, we want to talk about, you know, Full Metal Jacket more than I'm sure 
[01:41:30]  you want to.  Seven o'clock in the morning, so we're having coffee instead of beer.  Yeah.  Yeah, see?  Well, come back and see us.  All right.  I'll come back.  And wait, the movie is called, uh, it's Kettle Fish.  Kettle Fish.  It opened in New York City, and it says, and select cities, there's only three here  in the city.  Yeah.  Uh, theaters.  And, um, when does it open?  It was this Friday.  Yeah, you probably can look online and find it.  But yeah, it's plenty of three cities here in New York.  This is a really important weekend.  I encourage every New Yorker to come out and, and please come out and see the film.  That'd be great.  Starring Matthew Modine and Gina Gershon. 
[01:42:00]  The lovely.  Gina Gershon.  The lovely, yes.  She really is fantastic.  Yeah.  Good luck, man.  We're really, really happy you came in.  She's really sorry.  She wished she could have come in today.  She loves you guys.  She loves the show.  She's in, she's in Ireland working and then she just texted me from, from, uh, from Dublin  saying that she wishes that she was here.  Oh, that's cool, man.  Wow.  Someone got a text from Gina Gershon right near me.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  You feel kind of warm and fuzzy all over me.  And that's someone.  It's Matthew Modine.  Yeah.  So we got to thank Matthew Modine for stopping in.  We got to take a break here.  Thank you, Matthew.  All right.  Thanks so much.  We greatly appreciate it. 
[01:42:30]  Uh, more with Frank Caliendo after the break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  Very busy morning.  Frank Caliendo in studio.  He's going to be on Letterman tonight.  I came out of the bathroom and Matthew Modine was telling some hell of a story.  That was great.  I only got to hear the end of it.  It's in his book, which I would recommend, even though I haven't read it.  But I'm going out and getting it.  Jimmy's got it.  It's called Full Metal Jacket with the word Diary over Metal and Red by Matthew Modine. 
[01:43:00]  It's so much better than a memoir because he did it.  He wrote it as he was making the movie.  While he was doing it.  And it's a big picture book with diary entries and dialogue.  And it's a big metal book.  It's really great.  It's a big metal book called Full Metal Diary.  I'm trying to talk about how nice and insightful it is because it was done as he was doing it  because his character was a journalist.  So he figured he would use some of that in his acting.  And you...  A big metal book.  No, I'm just saying.  A big metal book.  Pretty silver book it is. 
[01:43:30]  I'm always saying that so people know what to look for in the store.  Heavy.  Heavy.  The thing I found really cool about him was he had the actor thing where he's almost like in slow motion.  Yeah, yeah.  But at the same time, he was like talking to you and not like...  Like a lot of times actors are just freaky where they don't seem to be communicating.  But when he would look at you in the eyes, he would pierce you.  It was creepy.  I kept looking away because I'm like, man, he's really, really looking right at me.  Also, it's more like he's thinking about what he's saying than just trying to be too cool for the room or something. 
[01:44:00]  And looking directly into your soul.  I think that's what he was scared about.  I hope he was like he can see it.  I'm like, hey, I don't want you to see that.  Don't look at that.  Right.  What was the story he was telling, though?  It was about him and D'Onofrio.  Yeah.  Yeah, having a little problem on set.  So the rumor is true because we should have asked him.  We forgot about that.  I didn't even know about it.  I didn't either.  Really?  I didn't know about it.  I really didn't.  Honestly, it was coming through the feedback.  I don't know. 
[01:44:30]  It's in his book.  They had a problem on the set after about a year in of filming.  And this thing went on for two years.  So they had a problem on the set.  It sounded innocent enough.  The guy's joking around a little on the set.  And Kubrick asked Matthew if he's ready for the scene.  And he said, yeah, yeah, something about fooling around.  What did I miss?  I'm really telling this well.  He was goofing around with the. 
[01:45:00]  She told it in the Bush voice.  That would have made perfect sense.  Fooling around with the English guys.  Right.  The English guys.  And Vinny D.  He didn't think he should be fooling around.  Right.  Because it's a serious thing.  You can't go up there and tell jokes.  Yeah.  In the midst of an Iraqistanian war.  Iraqistanian.  Trying to be funny.  You got to go out there and do what it is.  That's what you're doing.  And that's what.  Yeah.  Basically, they hated each other.  Yeah.  From that point on, they really had a problem.  And.  And it shows in the movie. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  There are scenes that they're doing together where it's obvious that there's no love lost.  Well, when he was fixing his collar, he goes, that's how you get that look.  Because I hated the guy at that moment in time.  They're talking about how they were like on a daily basis.  He's ready to kick each other's ass.  But now they have no problem.  They're fine with each other.  But back in the day.  Let's say hi to Craig in Jersey.  Craig, what's up?  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Hey, Craig.  I've been with you for a long time.  And you guys have your interviewing skills with these guys like Edward Norton.  And this morning with Matthew Modine. 
[01:46:00]  Let me tell you, man.  You get behind the guy.  And it's a really great.  Some of your best radio you do when these guys come in.  I love it, man.  Oh, look at us.  Oh, my God.  What a compliment.  Thank you.  Especially little Jimmy.  He kind of gets into it.  Because, you know, he does some acting as well.  Of course he does.  Yeah, you know what it is?  It's people like Matthew and myself.  We just connect.  We connect on a level.  We've all worked with people.  I didn't work with Stanley.  But there was talks.  And then Stanley.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know.  Mr.  You know, I wanted to chime in a couple times.  But I wanted to keep your audio clean with him a little bit. 
[01:46:30]  Because I almost wanted to go, you know, that movie is your John Madden, isn't it?  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just like you.  Yeah, anytime you try to make it sound like you're...  I can relate to that because of this.  And it just doesn't stack up to Full Metal Jacket or, you know, The Godfather or something.  Other huge, giant, iconic thing.  It was kind of cool how he tried to draw me in with different voices, though.  Isn't that what the president was? 
[01:47:00]  Did you notice he thought you were from SNL?  Oh, yeah.  He did say Saturday night.  I kind of just let that one slide.  You know what?  Poor Frank.  I'm going to be honest with you.  I would let people believe that.  All right.  Why not?  Makes me feel more important.  Let's go to Dwight at West Palm.  Dwight.  He's got it on his resume.  Yeah.  Hey, Dwight.  We lose Dwight?  I don't know.  Everything is on.  I hear you, Dwight.  What's up, Dwight?  You're in a submarine.  All right, Dwight.  Thanks for the call.  Dwight's on a delay.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes. 
[01:47:30]  Hi, Dwight.  I'm taking your call because Lil' Jimmy's going to the improv in West Palm Beach this weekend.  Tonight through Saturday.  Yeah, he's leaving today.  What's up, Dwight?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  I'm sorry.  Listen, I just wanted y'all guys to know I'm originally, you know, I've listened to Howard Stern  before, and since y'all guys have been on since, you know, I think it was like five months,  you said, yesterday.  Anyway, I've just been stuck on y'all because, like y'all guys say, it's like a virus.  And, you know...  You ought to use that. 
[01:48:00]  This is the worst promo for our show ever.  Man, that was genius.  Go ahead.  Thank you, Dwight.  You know, it's just...  I just wanted y'all guys to know that, you know, with Jimmy Norton and, you know, what  y'all guys talk about and everything, it just keeps me hooked.  So, I really appreciate it.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dwight, from beautiful West Palm, where I would go in December.  Yeah, go see Jimmy at the Improv this weekend.  Can you take a call from Chicago, where I'll be on Chicago Improv next week?  Ooh.  Next week?  Very good.  Yeah.  Two weeks from now.  Again, let's perfectly slid in plug, man. 
[01:48:30]  I mean, you work it in.  I mean, you find it in, take it out, boom, you're done.  Can we take a call from Chicago?  Chicago, so I'm going to be there.  Well, I thought it was great.  I love it.  That was great by him, and then I just, you know, it worked.  Let's give away a MacBook.  Find something, man.  Ooh, a MacBook.  Yeah, we got to give away a MacBook.  We had this contest, Frank.  It was beyond exciting.  I got it.  Hell yeah.  Do it like Matthew would have done.  We had this contest, President Bush.  It was just unbelievable, the entries we got for this.  You're talking much too fast.  Wow. 
[01:49:00]  No, I can't do it.  But then to work in a, you know, don't say, Frank, do say, President Bush.  Yeah, it was amazing.  We're looking for a 30-second production piece about the Opie and Anthony show.  The best five get MacBooks.  Sounds easy.  Wow, just exciting.  We've gotten hundreds, hundreds of responses that are just horrific.  Just not even so bad that they're good.  Just bad.  And it's so hard for our poor staff to go through this.  I think about it when I'm out cruising around in my sports car. 
[01:49:30]  I think about how awful it must be for you to sit there after hours.  After 1101 when I'm out the door and you guys are working diligently to find something good.  Well, here's today's winner.  Let's hear it.  It's Matt M.  Predators scouring the Internet.  Up next, you may be surprised who exactly does come calling.  What do you do for a living, Jim?  No, look, I'm a comedian.  I'm working at the cellar.  So you're going to do what exactly with 13-year-old Jessie?  See, what I do is I read in the bottom.  Then you just gently rub.  And then when she's relaxing, you smack her again. 
[01:50:00]  You get into very graphic detail about what you want to do.  I'll smell armpits.  I'll lick armpits.  And you won't believe what else he admits.  I have a virus.  All right, bravo.  I like that.  He took Jimmy's pornographic little talk about something that he had done.  I think it was a spanking thing.  And combined it with the Dateline Predators special that is oh so popular. 
[01:50:30]  Have you guys talked about this, the fact that on that show, they never stop eating the cookies?  No.  Predators love cookies, these pedophiles.  Do you realize what you're doing?  Hold on.  Is this?  Well, I'm Chris Hansen.  This is really good.  Now, you wanted to have sex with this girl.  Oh, these racins.  Really?  Finish your cookie.  He comes out of nowhere.  So, finish your cookies.  Right.  No, stay right there.  Stay right there.  Move my pants off? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, keep the pants off.  Are those famous Amos chocolate chips?  I love those.  Let me join you in that.  Now, you're trying to have sex with this young girl.  They're really good cookies.  These are delicious, I must say.  They're fantastic.  I always thought it's...  Now, our crew is going to come out now and film you as you...  Crew, can I finish this cookie?  First, please.  Hand me another.  I'm Chris Hansen from Dateline.  But you like some milk.  You want some milk?  I've got to wash it down. 
[01:51:30]  It's sticking to the roof of my mouth.  I'll go into the fake fridge here and get us some milk for our cookies.  Normally, I want to wash it down, but I just don't want to get rid of this cookie.  I would love...  He's kind of imposing, but I always thought even somebody different, and this is an impressionist  bit, but wouldn't it be great, like, a Jim Rome comes in there?  What are you doing?  What is going on on that plate?  You're eating the cookies, and you're trying to boink a underage kid.  That is ridiculous.  That is something you should not do. 
[01:52:00]  What are you thinking?  Not cool.  Now, I'm reading the transcript here, and where it says, I'd like to eat your cookie, I now  realize you should just be let go, and I'm sorry you've been brought into this, because  obviously you are just here for the cookies.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  They're all perfectly smooth sugar cookies.  Nothing on them to sully the flavor or appearance.  Right.  All right, here's the deal.  We've got to congratulate Matt M, today's winner.  Yeah, he won the unbelievable new MacBook.  It has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities, and you can take 
[01:52:30]  it with you wherever you go.  Now you can create your own music, movies, and websites.  It's so much easier than using a PC.  Head to the Apple Store or Apple.com to check it out for yourself.  The last winner will be tomorrow, I guess, the final MacBook.  That's right.  All right, we went along with Matthew Modine, so we've got to go to a break again.  I'm sorry.  I'm very, very sorry.  Real fast, though, Rob, what do you got?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I don't know if you guys know this, but Stanley Kubrick actually has the record, 
[01:53:00]  in the Guinness Book of Records, for the longest, for the most takes ever done for one  scene, actually, in The Shining.  The scene where Jack Nicholson's busting through the door and Shelley Duvall's in the bathroom,  he did that 147 times.  Really?  Yeah, he's actually very anal with his shooting.  Well, he was.  Yeah.  He isn't now.  Now he's just dead.  Yeah.  That's all we got, guys, so we'll punch it out.  Thank you.  It's the O.N.A. virus spreading across America. 
[01:53:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  We're hanging with Frank Caliendo today.  By the way, this is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Paul wants to say hi to Frank.  Paul from Brooklyn.  What's up?  Yeah, Frank, I've got to thank you very much.  Thanks to one of your invitations that I downloaded on my iPod, I got lucky several times with women.  What is that?  Which one?  John Madden?  Hey, you look sexy, baby.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no. 
[01:54:00]  The Sean Connery one.  Your Sean Connery routine.  I imitate it a little bit, but not as good as you, sir.  But I got to tell you, every time I've done that, especially when he starts acting like Austin Powers,  I've gotten lucky every time.  Really?  Lucky.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm the key to that box known as the lady.  Yeah.  You know, you guys do a little bit of Sean Connery.  Go ahead.  I've got a license to thrill, and I'll use it.  How's that?  Is that what you're looking for?  Is that making you happy?  Oh, it's making me a horny, baby.  And that gets you lucky? 
[01:54:30]  Dear sweet heaven.  That's getting you a tail?  That's getting you poo-ha.  Is he in the fatty fat contest or whatever?  Yeah.  I can't believe it, baby.  Wow.  You know what?  You close your eyes.  I'm thinking...  I know.  It's amazing.  You close your eyes.  But then again, I don't have to close my eyes because he's on the phone, so I'm just thinking  that it's got to be you.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  What's the website, by the way, Frank?  FrankCaliando.com.  Still got MaddenGuy.com.  And I got all those downloadable ringtones. 
[01:55:00]  You really?  Oh, yeah.  I whore it out.  And these are all free, actually.  It's just a way to get people the website.  Oh, okay.  Trying to get them to buy stuff from me.  It's not like Metallica where they're charging three bucks for...  You got one available?  No, huh?  Well, if you really want.  I want to hear the worst one.  Well, here's one.  I have President Bush on there going, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Hey, your phone's ringing, man.  I'm trapped inside your phone.  I must have been shrinkificated.  But I'm still El Presidente. 
[01:55:30]  You know, stuff like that.  I was at Ralph's in L.A., and somebody had one of my Pachito ringers.  I'm not kidding.  Wow, it must have been.  You got a phone call.  You got a phone call.  Answer it.  And I walked up to the guy, and I'm like, I'd answer that if I were you.  Because he wasn't getting it.  He just looked at me like I'm a freak.  I'm like, here's the guy who does that voice.  I'm the guy on your phone right now.  No, you're not.  See, I like ringtones.  He's taller.  But see, here's the problem.  After that great Al Pacino ringtone you just did, then you're supposed to go, hey, well, 
[01:56:00]  this is Frank Caliendo, and I just did the Al Pacino, and your phone's still ringing.  Like, why would you tag it?  I know.  Tag it with who you are.  That's what Metallica's doing, because you get a nice riff.  Faster!  Faster!  Your wife's calling.  Pick up the phone.  It's the whole, you know, music people trying to tell jokes.  That's always...  Comedians always want to be rock stars, and rock stars always want to be comedians.  It's a weird thing, but... 
[01:56:30]  Here's another actual Metallica ringtone.  Sad but true.  Your mom's on the phone.  James from Metallica says, pick up the phone!  See, you don't need to say James from Metallica.  James from Metallica.  How about maybe it would work?  Hi, this is Al Pacino, and save $3.  Don't get those Metallica ringtones.  Go to FrankCaliendo.com, MaddenGuy.com, if you really like to whore it out. 
[01:57:00]  Save $3.  I have a ringtone that I'm doing.  It will encourage people to answer the phone quickly.  Okay.  It just goes, I have kiddie porn on my computer!  I have kiddie porn on my computer!  I have kiddie porn on my computer!  Oh, that would be a fun one to download onto someone's phone, wouldn't it?  I'm getting that today.  Without their knowledge.  I'm getting that today.  Danny, take my phone.  I want that on my...  I'm Chris Hansen.  Mmm, good cookie. 
[01:57:30]  That's going to make me laugh.  Because you love the cookie thing.  Yeah, that's going to make me laugh all day.  That's a good bit.  Because you're right.  You picked up on some.  They're all about the cookies.  Sit down.  Yeah.  Why don't you have a seat right there?  I'm Chris Hansen.  Hi, Chris.  What?  Hi.  Oh, I couldn't understand you.  Your mouth is full of cookies.  Mm-hmm.  Which ones are you enjoying here?  We put out a whole platter for the pedophiles.  They really seem to enjoy the cookies when they're thinking about having sex.  Mm-hmm.  Well, this would be what, the nuts here?  Have you tried these Oreos? 
[01:58:00]  Oh, we're filling in them.  Actually, they're the Hydrox, not the Oreos, which I don't enjoy as much.  And I guess Hydrox, to me, would be like an overaged girl.  Oh, don't.  As opposed to the Oreo, which is like the young teen girl, which with, you're here to  have sex.  Yeah.  That's about right.  Okay.  When you're done eating the cookies, we'll bring in the police.  Okay.  We're not in a state where you can have weapons on you, where they can jump me outside, are 
[01:58:30]  they?  Yes, we are.  They're right outside waiting.  So as soon as you're done with the cookies, we'll be arresting you.  I don't have a gun on me or anything.  I just have some delicious...  It's been about an hour.  Or, he's still eating the cookies.  Why do they bring these kid touchers so many goddamn cookies?  Hey, do we have time to see what Karen Meyer is all about today?  Frank, you might want to leave the program for about 15 minutes.  Uh-oh.  This is where we show our ugly side.  I love it.  Do you remember years ago when you guys were on in New York before? 
[01:59:00]  I remember you used to get emails when I'd come on and be like, see, this is what your  show could be.  Yeah.  Pleasant with Frank Kelly and Doug.  Oh, yeah.  It's not as angry and mean and dirty.  Why do you have to go and be mean?  Well, we discovered this reporter out of Chicago.  She's on TV.  Her name is Karen Meyer.  We can't get enough of her.  The problem is she is deaf and she's on TV.  Well, they've, you know, for years they've taken the Asian reporter and done the Asian 
[01:59:30]  stories, the black reporter for the black stories, Hispanic stories, and she does the  handicapped stories.  And so they've gotten a deaf woman to do this and it's a little awkward.  And, uh...  Is it better than...  Would it be better with the midget with the hands coming up?  I would think the midget trying to hail a cab would be better.  Yes.  Would I have ringtones from that little nothing?  Oh.  Uh, someone's calling.  Can you answer for me?  My hands don't reach my ears. 
[02:00:00]  And then just a dull thought of something striking his little head.  Oh.  Well, Karen Meyer out of Chicago reports on beauty program.  That's not bad, right?  Deaf reporter reporting on a beauty program.  Now, why a beauty program if she does the, if she does the, um, uh, uh, handicapped stories?  Well, it's for girls with spinal cord injuries.  That's hilarious.  Oh, no.  We're the only ones that will, will, will tell it like it is. 
[02:00:30]  This is a freak show for the people out there.  They're not trying to get anything done.  Oh, boy.  It's basically turn on your TV, stare, and laugh.  What do you do?  Oh, jeez.  How do you doll up somebody with a spinal cord injury?  I don't know.  Why would you?  You paint those little toenails.  Oh.  On the end of those dangling turnip roots.  This is the side show.  They banned side shows. 
[02:01:00]  Now it's on TV for you.  Yeah.  But they, they hide behind the, you know, things like they might be doing something important.  And, um, you, you really can't understand a word she's saying, by the way.  No.  Do they subtitle her?  This is.  Yeah, they do.  This is probably the greatest find in Opie and Anthony history, this Karen Meyer, out of Chicago.  Big in Chicago.  She's huge in Chicago.  Well, who's going to be in Chicago?  Oh, me.  Jesus, Frank.  Well, I was trying, I was.  Here's the ball.  I was trying to think. 
[02:01:30]  At the improv, uh, improv.com.  Right.  Also, you can get your Jim Norton tickets there, too.  Uh, great.  They all show up at an Outback house.  I was just, I was thinking about how you're, the same thing with Springer, where you're  trying to drive up his ratings.  You're probably driving up hers.  Yeah, sure.  No, I'm not saying it's a bad thing.  I'm just saying, I'm just saying it's interesting.  We're not going to sit here and, and, and pretend that this is like real journalism.  This is stuff you're supposed to watch and laugh at.  Real journalism has cookies.  Yeah, there you go. 
[02:02:00]  Here's Karen Meyer reporting on beauty program for girls with spinal cord injuries.  Looking good always makes you feel better.  That's true.  A former patient at Shriners Hospital for Children established a beauty week to help teenage girls  with spinal cord injuries.  What?  You hear the banter?  Yeah.  There, Frank?  I like letting Frank in on this or any new listeners.  You hear the banter?  Yeah.  I defy you to tell me when the deaf reporter starts talking. 
[02:02:30]  It's almost, there's almost no difference.  Right.  Yeah.  You hear the, the banter and then somebody comes on and she, she's the deaf reporter.  We don't even know if she's really deaf or if she's faking it.  Yeah.  Here we go.  Looking good always makes you feel better.  That's true.  A former patient at Shriners Hospital for Children established a beauty week to help teenage  girls who had spinal cord injuries feel better about themselves.  ABC 7's Karen Meyer has that story. 
[02:03:00]  Two weeks ago at Marshall Field, the street store, girls from the age of 13 to 18 got makeovers  by a consulting consultant.  This is part of a newly created camp called Clam.  Good life and healthy mind.  Clam.  What?  What did she, what did she say?  One, you can't understand.  Clam.  What's with the background?  Dan.  Dan, dan, dan. 
[02:03:30]  This is what I'd be listening to.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  If I could hear.  Yeah, she can't hear it.  I can use a beat.  Nothing but Benny Hill music over every story she does.  That's what I want to hear.  Just Benny Hill music.  Yakety sax.  That's it.  Tap the little old guy on his bald head in fast motion.  What the hell does she say?  I don't know.  Something about, um, what was it? 
[02:04:00]  Something about, ah, yeah, yeah.  Her, glam, she's doing what glam stands for.  Some kind of glam.  Something about looking like a question mark, uh, I heard some troubles with some R's.  You want to try it again?  Like what you do when you have a spinal cord injury and you can't move below the neck,  don't put, like, big clown makeup on your friend.  Just to, I would love to doll up somebody who's paralyzed below the neck.  Like, oh, just put big arrows with, insert hog here on the face.  Paint him up like your drunken friend at a kegger. 
[02:04:30]  Or put a, paint a big black eye around the right eye and hang a doesn't listen sign around  her neck.  The art of the spineless.  I can't believe this is real.  I know.  I know.  It's really awful.  Is this an affiliate of something?  Affiliate of a network?  It's like, um, I think it's, I think it might be CBS.  No, it's ABC.  Oh, ABC?  It's ABC.  ABC out of Chicago.  Looking good always makes you feel better.  You gotta hear this again.  A former patient at Shriner's Hospital for Children established a beauty week to help 
[02:05:00]  teenage girls who had spinal cord injuries feel better about themselves.  ABC 7's Karen Meyer has that story.  Am I on?  Two weeks ago, how do you feel?  The street store, girls from age of 13 to 18, got makeovers by clinic.  This was part of a newly-queered camp called CLAM.  Good life and healthy mind. 
[02:05:30]  All right.  Girls from 13 to 18.  13 to 18.  Makeover.  Got makeover.  Part of a newly-queered camp called CLAM.  Yeah, I heard queer in there.  I don't know.  I think I might be wrong.  All right.  Well, I want to hear the next clip.  It'll sound much different than this one.  It'll just play the same clip three times.  I wish we could get that Benny Hill music and play.  I know.  CLAM is the brainstorm of 20-year-old Jessica Greenfield. 
[02:06:00]  I had an outfit for every day of the week to theme the sports.  And so I got known as the girly girl.  And they were like, Jessica, you're too girly.  You wake up in the morning and get a shower and you put makeup on.  And I was like, well, it makes me feel better.  And so I was sitting in my room and I was like, I want to design a girl camp.  With the help of Trider's staff, six teams are able to spend a week to look good and feel good.  Karen Heatherly is clinically-classmedic accountant's secretary. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, my God.  Why?  I really couldn't even...  I was with her for a while.  Yeah.  I was there.  I was there.  I think she starts talking in Morse code.  Glam for a week, dot, dot, dash, dash.  Dot, dot, dot, dot.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  Beep, beep, dot, dot, dot, beep, beep, beep.  I think I just said etowect.  I don't know what the hell she said at the end of that.  There are kids in colleges all over America in journalism school hoping to make it.  And they give this dummy a job.  She's no dummy. 
[02:07:00]  She just can't hear, Opie.  Whatever.  That music you hear is actually her iPod.  It's on and she just doesn't know it.  She's just yapping through it.  Why would she have an iPod?  That's the beauty of it.  Someone gave her that for Christmas because they figured she'd give it back and they could use it.  You know, you give somebody something that you want.  Right.  You know, they can't use.  Give her an iPod.  Sure.  That song, by the way, is Sexy Back, I guess, by Justin Timberlake.  Oh, is it?  According to the feedback, Adam.  Yeah.  According to the feedback, I don't know.  Yeah, trust me.  I don't want any part of that.  I don't know. 
[02:07:30]  I don't want any part of that.  According to that tent in Eric's jeans.  Yeah, it's Timberlake.  Yeah.  All right.  But most of that's voiceover, too.  Am I right?  A lot of that's voiceover?  Or is she there?  If it's voiceover, that seems to be the most irresponsible journalism.  You don't put somebody who can't communicate well in a voiceover position.  Yeah.  It's just you don't do it.  Why?  No, it's great, though.  It's a gimmick.  For the guys behind the scenes, everything's one take. 
[02:08:00]  Ah, good enough.  Yeah.  Yeah, I screwed up that line.  Do it over.  Honey, home early from work today.  Yeah, I had to work with Karen Meyer today.  Karen Meyer.  You know her old one take Meyer?  Right.  Can I do that again?  No need.  No need.  She should see if the engineers are paying attention and just read from Penthouse Forum one  day.  Right.  Yeah, it's on children with feet problems.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  He came into my room and undressed me to only. 
[02:08:30]  I was very hot and excited when in time of time with me, I heard there's not going to  mean to talk to you and drink a lot.  Perfect, Karen.  Thank you.  That was good.  Kids with the bad feet.  I love it.  We love that.  Thank you.  Bring the sports guy in for the sports scores.  Those two worthless seashells she has on the sides of her head.  We're brave enough to tell you what this is all about.  Come on, Chicago.  Wake up.  This is your freak show.  It's a gimmick.  It's such a gimmick.  All right.  Here's the final clip for today. 
[02:09:00]  Karen Meyer reports on beauty program for girls with spinal cord injuries.  So what we have done and tried to support is the piece of feeling as normal as they can.  And when they look good, they feel good.  You have a lot of confidence when you look good.  The girls also got handcuffs and clothing device from fashion designer Becky Torres.  You ready?  You ready?  Becky Brown is supposed to be part of Glam.  I remember last summer we were just looking at a notebook just like the outline of Glam Camp and it happened. 
[02:09:30]  It's amazing.  I hope that all the girls go home with a really good feeling and they feel more confident and they feel better about themselves and just better in their communities.  And I hope that in the next couple of years that every single Shriners has a Glam Camp.  Karen Meyer, ABC 7 News.  Imagine if she's interviewing this girl and she just keeps talking because Karen Meyer just keeps nodding her head.  Keeps nodding.  They don't even bother. 
[02:10:00]  There's different sound.  There's different background sound between when the girl's talking and when the reporter's talking.  Why would you play music when the deaf chick is talking?  She's so hard to understand.  It should be just dead silence.  Silence, yeah.  Jack up the volume.  Maybe put the words underneath her.  Yeah, do everything you can to make her understandable.  But they're putting techno music under her.  I want to see what they put like where they do like the – what is it called?  The box where the words show up? 
[02:10:30]  Teleprop.  Closed caption.  Closed caption.  Closed caption.  I guarantee every time that yutz opens her mouth, it just says unintelligible.  Just mealy-mouthed drivel.  They have to be taped bits so they can get the script from it.  Yeah.  Because you can't do it live.  No, she couldn't do it live.  She wouldn't understand what they're saying.  Old mashed potato ears.  Let's go to Brian in New York.  Brian.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, Brian.  Frank, it's a pleasure to speak to you.  You're an awesome guy.  And also you, Brian.  Jimmy, you're great.  Anthony. 
[02:11:00]  Anthony, you're a fucking wacko.  Oh, that's the language.  Goodness.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  Opie, line of the day.  You're trying to figure out what she was saying.  And Opie said something like they look like a question mark.  Oh, okay.  I hope I get line of the day today.  That was great.  Thanks, Brian.  Yeah, man.  Oh, but someone's saying Jim's going to get line of the day today.  Clay, California, what's up?  Repetitive here.  Hey, you guys are just freaking killing me, man.  I'm driving through the mountains out here in California right now.  And Norton about just made me roll off a cliff. 
[02:11:30]  Line of the day.  Jaw lines up her chest with the arrows pointing to her mouth saying, insert hog here.  Very good.  Yeah, this is a good one.  Hey, why don't we point out, thank you, sir.  Why don't we point out Anthony on Long Island.  All right, we'll let him say it and we'll leave you guys.  Anthony, go ahead.  Yo, it's a piece about spinal cord injuries and they're playing sexy back.  See, they got a sense of humor there, too.  You guys do this every Friday. 
[02:12:00]  They couldn't find useless back.  Very nice.  Thank you, Anthony.  With that, we got to go.  We got to...  Can I point out that I've been looking at that midget picture the whole time?  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  And it looks like when you drive your car through Jungle Habitat, he looks like a small  animal just throwing himself to the side of the taxi.  Crawling up ready to rip off your windshield wiper and eat it.  Just a confused animal throwing himself against a man's machinery.  Take a picture of it.  What was the music that he has in his head all day?  Anybody remember? 
[02:12:30]  Oh.  Tootly-doo.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Tootly-doo.  Well, the picture's up on obanthony.com.  We got to get out of here.  We got to get to XM to continue the show.  So, Frank Caliendo, you're going to join us for a little longer?  Yeah.  All right.  If you're not joining us over at XM, make sure you check out Frank Caliendo on Letterman  tonight.  How's that, Frank?  Sounds great.  And frankcaliendo.com?  Sure.  And check out his YouTube videos.  They're great.  I'll see you to West Palm.  They're great.  And Jim Norton's going to be leaving us.  He's going to be in West Palm Beach all weekend.  So, Jim, have a great trip there.  All right, guys.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day. 
[02:13:00]  I'll see you.  Great day.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The O.B. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  And a ladder beat that.  It's already too fucking cold.  It's Andrew in this box.  Oh, no.  Is that Andrew's house now? 
[02:13:30]  Hey, he built a house.  Andrew.  Andrew, are you home?  Don't kick it.  Andrew.  Is someone in there?  Andrew.  Who's in there?  Andrew.  There's a cat.  It's a homeless guy with a cat.  He took Andrew's spot.  What's up?  Wait.  Who's yelling at us?  There's some dude in there.  It's like a refrigerator box. 
[02:14:00]  Wow.  Yo, Andrew.  Andrew.  Is that you?  That ain't you home?  Watch out.  You might get shot.  Is Andrew home?  Hello?  Does he live here?  Huh?  Does Andrew live here?  Doesn't Andrew live here?  Huh?  You took Andrew's spot?  Wait.  Hold on.  It's a new dude.  Bro, I'll just put the mic over here, all right?  What's your name? 
[02:14:30]  Sir, what's your name?  We'll throw some dollar bills in the slot.  He's moaning.  What's your name?  Robert?  What are you doing in the box?  You woke him up early.  He's got a business meeting at 10.  Someone give me money.  You want money, sir?  No.  No?  You don't want money?  He just wants to sleep.  He does have a house.  Dude, you got a nice crib here, bro.  Looks like shoddy workmanship.  All right.  We'll leave you alone.  Four boxes taped together against a metal grating of a store. 
[02:15:00]  Wow.  I thought it was Andrew getting ready for the winner.  No, he took Andrew's spot.  Andrew's like the weakling.  What do we got over here?  Hey, how you doing?  Give us a little toot toot.  Yeah.  Because that's what New York needs.  More noise.  That sounded exactly like Karen Meyer talking.  Oh, I like the kerchief, sir.  That's very nice.  Holy homosexual. 
[02:15:30]  That's what you hang yourself with when they give you the test results.  I'm going to cross the street now.  Oh, fester.  It's like our old pal Bill.  It's, you know, it's cold already.  I'm annoyed because it's too cold already to be walking.  Frank's in shorts.  Yeah, yeah.  And Frank's in shorts.  Wasn't it 85 degrees yesterday?  Yes.  Yeah.  Frank Madden's in shorts. 
[02:16:00]  Frank Madden.  Is your mic on?  It was in Phoenix.  It should be.  Can you hear me?  No, barely here.  Fix his microphone.  Hello?  I wanted you to do some Madden.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we're walking across the street now.  I mean, there's been a guy in a Patriots hat and not looking so good this year.  So, you know, I mean, last game was okay, but before that didn't look okay.  And now I'm in stereo.  I mean, you think of this guy on the cell phone over here and then, boom, that way he's on the way to a green hospital. 
[02:16:30]  Walk me into a hole.  All right.  Isn't this completely ridiculous?  Hey, our talent show is supposed to start today.  Yeah, where's the talent?  It's a walkover talent show.  There's no talent.  Oh, you might want to turn that on.  There you go.  All right, guys.  Now am I on?  Oh, there you are.  Now I hear you.  Had me a bunch of off equipment.  All right, here you go.  Hey, what's wrong with your iPod, sir?  We want to find out. 
[02:17:00]  We could give a shit.  And we started the walkover talent show yesterday.  Yeah, and what happened?  Well, there's a lot of people that want to get our attention.  All you have to do is get our attention during the walk and do what you want to do.  We've got nothing.  And that's that.  If it's something really good, we'll invite you upstairs and we'll see what you're about.  I guess we have no one today, but it'll take time to get the word out there and get the  thing going.  What does this guy got?  Is this a talented guy? 
[02:17:30]  It looks like it.  He's got some CDs.  Which guy?  Oh, is he going to give us CDs or something?  Oh, Jesus.  I don't want to take one.  I don't want to take one.  What is this?  Here it is.  The gift of porn.  The gift of porn.  Oh.  What is it?  Nothing says friendship like teen on teen, teen girl on girl porn.  I hope it's homosexual.  It's just photos.  It's not live action.  It's just photos.  Just photos.  Uh-oh.  He could be handing you a felony.  You've seen us in an email. 
[02:18:00]  I'm Chris Hansen.  Is that Gary Glitters?  Yes.  I'm Chris Hansen.  Gary's computer.  I'm Chris Hansen.  Sir, where did you get these pictures?  On the internet?  Here are some cookies.  I'm actually the photographer.  Do they depict teenage girls having sex?  Yes, they do.  Do they?  You want a cookie?  We have Oreo Fig Newtons.  They're a little chewy.  What's in those Fig Newtons, by the way?  Have some lemonade.  Sit by the blow-up pool.  And have some cookies while the police beat your skull in. 
[02:18:30]  I'll wait right here.  What's on there?  Are they girls of what?  What age?  Uh, teens.  Well, that really goes a long way.  19, 18?  19, 18?  And then he makes it sound like it's going to go younger.  No, no.  Probably no younger.  No, definitely not younger.  Probably.  Probably.  Probably.  That's good.  Probably.  That's good.  These are some obscure shots that I got at the elementary school.  That means his screening process isn't that good.  All right.  Well, they said they were. 
[02:19:00]  They said they were 18.  You're a photographer.  You took the pictures?  I took the photos.  Oh, you did?  And I'm no photographer.  So you're a creep.  Exactly.  You're just a creep with a camera.  Exactly.  Where'd you get the girls?  Vegas Hookers.  Vegas Hookers.  Oh, nice.  Vegas Hookers.  Where else would you go?  Yeah, you gave one to John Madden, by the way.  Here, John.  Here's your gift of porn.  Contents, Teen Girl on Girl Slideshow there.  I mean, that's a good one.  I mean, believe me, there's going to be a lot of sliding going on there.  And then 2005 AVN Parade of Porn.  I mean, I don't know if it's an award winner, but it is AVN. 
[02:19:30]  Hey, John, what's your fetish?  Well, I like the strap-on, you know, like the strap-on, a little freak in there.  Wow, I didn't see that coming.  I looked and saw the XM and said, hey, I can say whatever I want.  I thought he was going to go safe and say foot.  No, no, no.  Right for the strap-on.  Strap-on, yeah.  There's more hair over your eyes than on every girl in those videos, by the way.  Well, and that's why I just realized I can't go there.  I tried to and I wanted to, but I didn't. 
[02:20:00]  And then I realized, hey, 18 and over.  Porn really got some work, though.  Yeah, it sure does.  Oh, sorry.  Well, thank you for the gift of porn today.  Thank you for the gift of porn, sir.  See, it's as easy as that, Anne.  A lot of people try to get our attention.  That's easy.  All you have to do is meet us on the walkover and hand out what you want to hand out.  Oh, damn it.  I wish I could.  Wait, what is this?  What are you?  You make me laugh, so I'm Scotty.  From Scotty and Fisher?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we do a morning show, too, but I listen to you guys all the time. 
[02:20:30]  Ooh.  How could you listen to us all the time if you're doing your own morning show?  Replay.  Ah, the replay.  What do you hear, yeah?  Where do you do a morning show?  Cool, man.  South Carolina.  Okay, cool.  Well, thank you.  South Carolina.  It's called the Scotty and Fisher Show.  ScottyandFisher.com.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  One of the three acts.  That's not Napoleon Fisher, is it?  Thank you, man.  South Carolina.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, I know.  Thanks, Tommy.  I'm slow.  We'll give you a plug.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  Cool, man.  Thanks, man.  See you?  We're on to something.  See how easy it is?  A lot of people want to get our attention.  Just show up on the walkover and tell us what you got. 
[02:21:00]  If you want to kill us, we're very easy to find.  Jesus.  That big dummy will take a bullet for us, though.  Kenny.  Forget about it, right?  By the way, his hair's made of Kevlar.  Shredded Kevlar.  Anyone else notice the crowd is growing every day now?  Yes.  For the walkover?  It's going to be pandemonium soon.  Pandemonium.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Maybe we'll let some people up today. 
[02:21:30]  We've got to figure that out.  Stay right there.  Kenny's like a Studio 54 guy.  He waits at the entrance.  We try to let the people up that are visiting New York because it's like once in a lifetime.  You know what?  It isn't even seeing us up there.  It's getting to meet the guy at the desk here.  That's what I think the highlight of bringing people up is.  Signing in, saying hi to the guy at the front desk.  Because I know we all get along with him.  Jimmy just loves him. 
[02:22:00]  I think that somebody cut off one of Karen Meyer's ears.  It's just a useless appendage with a diamond stud in it.  Well, try to be nice.  Yeah, try to be nice.  Because I'm going to...  I'll be cool.  I will.  Good afternoon, sir.  How are you today?  Oh, morning.  It is in the afternoon.  Ah, see?  I get confused.  It's not your foreskin, you chimp.  Wait a turn. 
[02:22:30]  Sorry.  Get that elevator.  Oh, my God.  Oh, let's see.  Now, you hate that, don't you?  I will be upstairs.  You should have done that.  I'm going to push the button thing.  I'll be up in a minute.  Here, here, here, here, here.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing? 
[02:23:00]  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  How to touch corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie. 
[02:23:30]  You know I can't have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  See, sometimes we're here early. 
[02:24:00]  See?  You don't have to wait through an hour of this.  Sometimes this plays like if we're stuck in the elevator or it takes a while to get up  here or everybody else, like they are, goes to the bathroom and no one's here.  This right here, this music, we'll just play and play and play and aggravate the shit out  of everybody listening to this program.  But we don't care.  There's some nice Karen Meyer background.  Yes.  I'm here to turn another comment about the other drinks. 
[02:24:30]  Can someone turn this music down?  Even I hear it.  That's nice.  Little Jimmy Norton.  How is your leak?  Yeah?  Yeah.  You're very quick in there.  Did you wash?  I hope you wash your hands.  No, my...  Your dick is...  Your dick is...  My dick's immaculate.  Oh, right.  That's good to know.  Honestly, I'll wash my hands before I piss. 
[02:25:00]  Before you piss?  Yeah, man.  But not after.  For what?  Oh, okay.  Shaking hands?  No, I just shake and I fucking squeeze the shaft.  Yeah, but it's just the fact that you're touching your own dick.  Doesn't matter.  It doesn't bother me.  It gives me a little...  It gives me the heebie-jeebie.  Nah, don't let it bug you.  It'll all work out.  Isn't that the holiday that just passed a heebie-jeebie?  It's a little Jew joke.  Sorry.  I have a little Jew joke.  Jeez.  Look at him taking me serious.  Let's fucking fight her around.  Let's go to Dominic in New Jersey.  Dominic. 
[02:25:30]  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hi.  You guys are so freaking funny.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well.  I listen to you guys all the time.  I can't believe I'm even on the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you.  I wanted to give props to Jimmy's line of the day.  Actual propellers?  Because that'd be funny if someone gave Jimmy props and came in with a huge steamship propeller.  Hold on.  Please hold.  Please hold.  Thank you. 
[02:26:00]  Thank you.  Oh, good.  I thought I was going to get the crack.  No.  I was the one with that one, my friend.  Hey, how about you get to your point?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Keeps me from babbling.  Joe, when the truck blew the horn on the walkover, Jimmy said, that sounded like Cameron  Meyer.  I thought that was so funny.  Okay.  I didn't hear that because there was a horn blowing.  Yeah, that was after us.  It was like, argh.  What did the soup man bring?  Thank you, buddy.  I hope there's turkey chili in there. 
[02:26:30]  Five bean chili?  No.  Sausage gumbo?  No.  No.  That last bag better have it.  Five bean chili would be nice today for the soup man.  Negative.  All right.  Hey, we got to get five bean chili?  We got to get Dax in.  He's got to leave.  Five bean chili?  Actually, why does it smell like soap in here?  Is that your penis?  That is actually the sterilization of all the foam on the microphones.  That is it? 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  Isn't it nice, pleasant?  Wow.  Different than the elevator, which smells like Jimmy's ass.  Did you hear that one?  Hi.  Oh, I'm not on.  No, you're on.  I am?  Turn your headphones on.  Come on.  I want to hear my lovely voice.  You got a good voice.  You know, speaking of smells, I just visited your restroom.  And there is no lack of dumps being taken this morning in there.  So I commend your...  Oh, yeah.  That is a zoo.  Yeah, there's four or five stalls lined up.  And there's just dumps 24 hours a day in that place. 
[02:27:30]  Any time of the day.  There must be a sizzler bar set up in the basement here or something.  Any time of the day, you can go in there and it smells like a gorilla cage.  It is the worst smelling bathroom ever in a building.  It smells like an outhouse at a racetrack.  Did you do radio?  Did I?  Did I?  Yeah, no.  I mean, I've done it to promote stuff and I love it.  You got the voice.  Really?  Yeah, you got a voice.  Thank you.  You've got the face for hand modeling.  No, I don't know.  You're a handsome guy.  That's what I was trying to say. 
[02:28:00]  Wow, we're off to a weird start.  I think it isn't weird at all.  I think I see some sparks flying here.  I felt a little Vincent D'Onofrio.  I felt like full plastic jacket right there.  What are these?  Is that Pacino?  No, it's a Harlan Williams, buddy.  My guy.  There you are, fellas.  No, but he told me, hey, buddy, life's too short not to heat your swimming pool. 
[02:28:30]  Suddenly I turned into John Wayne there, buddy.  Why don't you know there with your great vest on trying to find a way around the virus?  Hey, buddy.  Salting a few fellas on your way in here?  Hold on a second.  Ryan in Texas.  Ryan.  Yes, sir.  Hey, what's up?  Not much.  How are you?  Good.  What's up?  Not too much.  We're just staying outside the studio.  I want to come up.  You're outside.  You want to come up?  Yes, sir.  You didn't bring any knives or forks with you, did you? 
[02:29:00]  No, we did not bring any knives or forks.  All right.  We'll come down and get you.  Okay.  All right.  You came from Texas, I guess, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  How'd that sign get back up?  It's all right.  I just don't like that it doesn't have our names on it.  Yeah, why?  Why would you call the virus?  Very important to have our names on it.  No one is going to look at that and know what it means.  All right.  Someone will.  So what's up, Dad?  Very sad.  Yeah.  I just came from the Today Show.  Oh.  How was that?  Well, let me tell you. 
[02:29:30]  When I landed here in New York, I always get this song stuck in my head the second I land,  which is,  If you get lost between the moon and New York City.  Right.  And guess who was at the Today Show?  Christopher Cross.  Dudley Moore's foot.  Liza Minnelli.  Liza Minnelli.  Oh, God bless her.  I told Dane, I bet you that gal will give you a wild ride.  You think?  Oh, I bet she's got tricks.  She's been in it for a while.  Yeah.  They say she's got the diseases.  Not her first day at the rodeo, boys. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  She likes the banging.  You fucking hear her bottles clanking around.  What a drunk.  How do you not love Liza?  What a drunk.  Fucking.  I liked her years when she had the Moe Howard hairdo from Arthur.  Hey, Liza.  She had to look at that fucking cadaver David guest.  Oh, yeah.  I have to love the two of them.  For a week.  Oh, was he awful.  They were together.  Stop.  How do we know so much about Liza?  A couple of fucking Moes.  So, how was the Today Show? 
[02:30:30]  It was an action-packed free-for-all, as it always is.  Yeah.  A lot of Middle Eastern, Midwestern people with signs.  Middle Eastern would be silly.  A lot of Shiites.  Allah loves you.  A lot of Shiites there.  Yeah.  Holding up their signs.  They love Lawler.  Lawler?  Matt Lawler.  What's his name?  Matt Lawler.  I was told by a gal that a lot of women pleasure themselves in the morning watching Matt  Lawler.  Matt Lawler?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not kidding.  Really?  Yeah.  He's a handsome guy. 
[02:31:00]  He is.  Not unlike Opie.  Maybe on the edge of the...  Why are you going after me?  I'm not.  I'm telling you you're a handsome guy.  You don't know how to take a compliment.  I know.  Opie was trying to fix it there.  You don't know how to take a compliment as far as your looks go.  Well, what?  If somebody says you're a good-looking guy...  But it's a dude saying it.  It's not...  Well, that makes it twice as impactful.  Creepy.  No.  A girl, of course, thinks you're handsome, but a straight man telling you you're easy  on the eyes?  That's the ultimate compliment.  The guy's confident in himself. 
[02:31:30]  Why do they call you Opie?  All right.  Thank you.  I've never figured that out.  I'm hot.  All right.  Let's move on.  You're on buses, though, right?  Well, it was in the elevator.  I didn't realize it was that bad until in the elevator, Ann almost touched you, and then  now this.  You're scared.  No, no.  We don't like touching.  Ann and I have known each other 12 years.  There's no reason to.  We hugged the first time three weeks ago after our Letterman appearance.  Really?  That was the first time we ever hugged.  And also a small open mouth kiss.  And a couple fists every once in a while. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  But not like Caligula.  Who doesn't enjoy a fist every once in a while?  Not like...  The Wonder Twins?  Yeah.  I guess I should be in movies, then.  Fisting is a gateway activity, though.  I will warn you.  It seems like just a couple of dudes fisting, and the next thing you know, you're looking  at each other longingly in the eyes.  It's a little...  Yeah.  I think some kind of commitment has to be made after a fisting.  Yeah.  You can't just fist and leave.  Yeah.  Like drop off cab money.  You owe him a breakfast or something.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  When you hold hands...  You're spending the day together.  Right.  You fisted your buddy.  It's just...  He's not leaving anytime soon.  No.  There's no, I gotta get off to...  Yeah.  ...wherever you say you're going.  I gotta peroxide my hand and hit this meeting.  Are there meetings for survivors of fisting?  Well, just other meetings in their lives.  Just a bunch of chairs lined up with those little blow-up donuts in the middle of them  so you can sit down there.  The little inner tube that you sit on. 
[02:33:00]  That's how you know this must not be AA.  It's F-A.  I'm at the right place.  But none of them are anonymous.  You always knew who the arcs are in the corner crying alone.  Face burning their own lap.  I think the people you brought with us, with you, I should say, are horrified.  Are they horrified already?  That didn't take long.  They're like a bunch of air donuts I've seen.  I just made the PG-13 movie I'm promoting, NC-17.  Oh, great.  Are they publicists? 
[02:33:30]  Publicists?  Two are lovers and rolling.  Who's the one in the green?  She's a gal that works for Lionsgate.  Oh, very nice.  Do you like her look?  Because I could set this up.  I like her.  I've got a way with her.  I could probably.  We've got to be nice to the Lionsgate girl.  Yeah.  Publicist, though.  The publicist?  She's a fox, isn't she?  Look at her.  She's a fox, but most publicists are buzz kills.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  We've done many interviews where the publicist will stand right behind the guests with their  arms folded. 
[02:34:00]  And then all of a sudden they'll lean in.  Don't answer that.  Don't answer that.  And then they drag them out.  Let's see if we can get her in here.  Let's see if you can put her to the test.  Ask me some stuff that may be career-ending.  Let's see.  Career-ending?  We were just talking about fisting.  Yeah, but I didn't say I'm guilty of any fisting.  What are you guilty of doing?  I may or may not have killed a man in Iowa.  Just to watch you die.  His body may or may not be in the parking lot of big boys as we speak. 
[02:34:30]  Just for snoring.  Oh, got John Wesley Harding fucking shot a guy for that.  Just for snoring.  How do you not love that?  Remember that Time Life book collection commercial from years ago?  Here, have a breathe right strip, cocksucker.  Let's say hi.  Don't mean you want to shout a man just for snoring, Diddy.  Let's say hi to Michael in Texas.  Michael.  Hey, Dax.  I love Diddyocracy.  Oh, thanks, buddy.  But what the hell is happening with that?  It came out in like seven cities.  I saw it here in Dallas, and then it was gone in like a week. 
[02:35:00]  Is that going to be released on DVD?  Because I'm telling everyone about it.  No one gets inside jokes about Bayton.  No one knows.  Go away, Bayton.  Yeah, what the hell?  There's all kinds of conspiracy theories.  But, yeah, Fox actively tried to bury it for some reason.  They actually listed it wrong on Movie Phone on purpose.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  They didn't let it come out on the East Coast because they didn't want it reviewed. 
[02:35:30]  So, I don't really know what the story is behind it, but I know they did not treat Mike Judge the way he deserves to be treated.  What do you think happened?  I don't know.  There's a lot of corporate kind of trashing going on.  I don't know if old Rupert Murdoch.  I don't know.  Ah, shit.  Okay.  What?  I'm looking at him just going, what the fuck?  I know the guy.  What?  No, Zathara.  I just saw it. 
[02:36:00]  You just saw it?  I just saw it.  Do you have a child?  You're the astronaut.  Yeah.  Yes, my girlfriend.  You're going nice.  Hello, are you having sex?  I'm Chris Hansen from Dateline.  Have a cookie.  She's legal now.  Now, let me ask you.  I've got to clarify that, though.  Did you actually go rent that movie, or was it on your cable?  No, it was on my cable.  But, to your credit, I had to go to...  On Demand.  Ooh.  And go through and get it on demand.  So you did the legwork, yeah.  It was good, because, you know, the whole Jumanji thing... 
[02:36:30]  Sure.  ...was very good.  I thought I liked it.  Something we wanted to distance ourselves from.  Of course.  And it just got hammered and nailed together.  But I liked it.  Thank you.  You were the astronaut.  Thank you.  Can you bring me into the conversation?  He's in a movie.  Yeah?  Zathara.  Yeah.  What's it about?  Seriously.  I'm not going to make believe.  Sometimes we'll make believe.  Yeah, I saw that movie.  It was great, man.  You're the best in the movie.  I really don't know.  It's a couple of kids.  They go, well, I could explain it, but let me just say Jumanji in space. 
[02:37:00]  No, I'm kidding.  He doesn't want to hear that.  Of course he doesn't.  No, you know how you say you just make stuff up?  When Punk'd was first on, I'd have these meetings at studios, and they had to act hip  like they were with, you know.  And they'd go, oh, yeah, we saw Punk'd.  When you get kicked in the nuts, that is...  Like, they were thinking it was Jackass or something.  And they assumed maybe there was guys getting kicked in the nuts.  The early seasons of Punk'd were great.  The first season, primarily, was really spectacular.  Well, then it went downhill drastically, but when it first hit TV, it was so unique, and 
[02:37:30]  I really, really enjoyed you on Punk'd.  What was cool about the first season, too, is that no one knew what Punk'd was.  So it's like, at the end of the Timberlake one, we'd be like, you got Punk'd, and that  didn't help at all.  Right.  That didn't mean anything.  It was like, oh, great.  What's that?  Right.  Got a sandwich or something?  And then they were all expecting it, unfortunately.  Yeah.  It's too bad you couldn't do, like, five or six seasons before it even aired.  That's the way to do those shows.  It's like how would Ali G do shows now as a character, because he's so famous.  It's like he had to have had seasons in the can.  There's no way to do any of those characters now, because everyone knows who they are. 
[02:38:00]  Because the later seasons...  Well, but he at least targets primarily senior citizens and congressmen.  Who would never know.  And I think they're still in the dark about Sasha.  Yeah.  His staff would probably know, though.  That, you know, when you walk in and you're dressed like, you know, the Jamaican.  I don't know if...  Can I not have said that?  Can I have said that fucking worse?  It was really bad.  I don't know how they let, like, Jon Stewart's guys in.  Politicians, you know?  Right.  They seem to be the easiest.  Or the Colbert Report. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  Like, the hardest people for us to get were always rappers.  We'd always schedule these rapper punks, and we'd be waiting for, like, three or four  days before we pulled the plug.  Yeah.  Like, they would never, ever show up where they were supposed to be.  Wow.  Who would you try to get that would be the show?  Like, which one could get shot?  Well, I came...  We went to New York one time, like, flew all the way out from L.A., rented the roof of  the Hudson, set up this gigantic thing.  We were supposed to punk Busta Rhymes, and Britney Spears was helping us.  And the day of, he fought Ja Rule on a sidewalk and got arrested.  So, like, we were all there. 
[02:39:00]  You don't try to pull off a punk that it's actually a job.  What?  That's what?  I didn't mean to hang out in the drive.  I literally didn't know that much.  No, I knew Jimmy would get it first.  See, that's why they're not showing up, okay?  Little inappropriate, a little racist, I understand.  Yeah.  What are these sacks of food here?  What are they?  That is soup, man.  Soup.  You know the soup Nazi from Seinfeld?  Yeah, yeah.  This is it?  It's that guy.  Well, not him.  He's an actor.  And he got bought by Taco Bell? 
[02:39:30]  Look at his bags.  It's the guy who he was based on, the character he was based on, and he makes really good soup.  It's legitimate.  Yeah.  It's really legit, and it's, like, really good stuff.  You want to try some?  So they send it there every morning for us.  I just threw down one of Starbucks' new breakfast sandwiches.  Oh, hell yeah.  Let me tell you what they do.  They've got a genius bait and switch over there.  They have a sample, and it was made probably by a famous chef.  And then you order one, and they put it in a nuclear reactor and give you a 700-degree biscuit. 
[02:40:00]  So I definitely got screwed up.  They really have breakfast sandwiches, though?  Yeah, they just started.  They're basically Egg McMuffins.  Exactly.  Are they good?  I wouldn't have.  I would not have.  That is funny, though.  You go to some place like Wolfgang Puck's.  That's the name I was looking for.  It's like the chain store.  Yeah, the chain restaurant of Wolfgang Puck's.  And, of course, Wolfgang Puck designed the menu and the food.  But do you honestly think this jack-off that works in the back is cooking as well, taking the frozen samples, 
[02:40:30]  and then the waitress just slings it on your table, and it's like,  I bet this is just like eating at Wolfgang Puck's house.  No.  It was a step down from McDonald's.  The one they served me.  But, again, the sample was delicious.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course, it would be.  You're a big star now.  Why are you doing that?  Why are you getting your breakfast sandwiches from Starbucks?  Because I had to cram in a little meal between the Today Show and here.  I didn't want to get peeked.  And this very important appearance.  Yeah.  I should have done the walkover with you guys.  We could have stopped in somewhere.  Yeah. 
[02:41:00]  Stopped in.  Ducked in.  We've done that before.  You have.  Getting recognized a lot now?  You know, it goes in waves.  Like, when Punk'd was on, I think that was the height of...  Really?  Well, because they would air each episode, like, six more times throughout the week.  And it was just really on people's minds.  What about...  People go see a movie and then for a month...  Zathura.  Or Zathura.  Or Zathura.  That's how I'm being chastised on the Pal Talk for saying it wrong.  Oh.  Zathura.  Zathura.  No one else in the country could say it correctly either, so... 
[02:41:30]  Always good.  You're in good company, I think.  Yeah.  I love when...  That was an oddly marketed movie.  You didn't really feel like it was, like, a game...  Like, a board game that turns into some kind of science fiction thing.  It was...  Yeah, you know, I wasn't quick to point the finger of why it failed.  Like, I assumed maybe it was my fault for picking, like, the wrong movie.  I mean, Jon Favreau directed it and I was super flattered just that he wanted me to be in anything.  So I did it and then it tanked and I didn't... 
[02:42:00]  I couldn't figure out why.  But then I went on vacation, like, a week after it came out.  And a lot of different people at this hotel had approached me and said, like,  Oh, we liked Without a Paddle and we liked Punk.  When are you going to have a movie coming out?  And I'd say, Oh, I have one out right now.  Zathura.  And there was nothing.  Just a blank stare.  Now, they might not remember Zathura, but you'd remember there was a movie out with a Z in the title.  Didn't Donald Trump, didn't they promote it?  Wasn't that one of the games on The Apprentice?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  And then the commercial they went to was, like, the six-year-old version of the commercial,  which there are a bunch of different spots.  I don't know.  I don't understand, like, because it looked really good, visually. 
[02:42:30]  It is really good.  And it is a good movie.  Like, I liked it.  Especially for a kid's movie.  I liked it.  It's very, like, 80s Spielberg-y.  And it wasn't like a kid's movie where only kids could watch it, because, you know,  I am technically retarded, but I enjoyed it as an adult.  Right.  Like, I can also enjoy it, not just a kiddie movie or something.  I don't understand why.  I think it's the goddamn title.  I think you have to blame whoever gave it that title.  Well, yeah. 
[02:43:00]  I have a question, too, man.  What were you going to do to Busta Rhymes?  Yeah.  That guy's a problem.  Oh, yeah.  He's a problem, man.  You know, I think, because that was the episode Britney Spears was assisting us, if you can  say that.  And I guess she was supposed to, she was going to tell him she was getting into rap and  try to get him to, you know, be a part of her album.  And then I was going to hit him in the head with a bat or something.  But I can't remember.  You know, it didn't go down, so.  You ever get hit? 
[02:43:30]  No.  I'm trying to remember.  We were going to try to punk somebody like Mike Tyson or somebody, and it occurred to  me I'm probably going to get knocked out during this.  But then I also quickly thought, well, it's so worth it.  I'm surprised you didn't get hit or something.  Well, I saw Mike Tyson in Vegas once, and he came up to me and he was like, I want to  do Punk'd.  And I'm like, you're Mike Tyson.  You can definitely do Punk'd, whatever you want.  He's like, all right, I'm going to do it.  Then I saw him a week later at the NBA All-Star Game.  I was with my buddy.  I'm like, oh, check this out.  Mike Tyson knows me. 
[02:44:00]  He loves me.  I'm going to go talk to him.  Oh, no.  So I go, Mike, what's up?  He's like, I don't know you motherfucker.  Get out of my face.  Did he really?  It was a week ago you knew who I was.  What happened?  I thought he was going up to you going, I want to do it right now.  Like, he thinks he could just get Punk'd from nowhere.  Where are the cameras?  I just Punk'd you.  What?  You say, I don't know you motherfucker.  Get out of my face.  Yeah, yeah.  He was in some crazy state.  He had the 40-yard stare going.  He was either on or off the Zoloft.  No one really knows which.  To kill y'all.  It is.  I'm on the Zoloft to prevent me from killing y'all. 
[02:44:30]  He goes, well, I'm on the Zoloft to keep from killing y'all.  Is that what he said?  In a press statement.  And by y'all, he meant earth.  Like, everyone on earth.  Well, I remember seeing an interview with him where he said that he was retiring from boxing.  And he said, you know, I'm really excited to get into some things I haven't done.  Like, drinking.  Like, I never had time to drink.  Wow.  Now that's something I'd like to see.  That's going to be his new endeavors.  Wow.  That's what you want is that hammered Mike Tyson.  If he starts drinking, the punk you have to do is bring him to Broadway and say he's going to do a Broadway show. 
[02:45:00]  And then chain him with high-tensile steel chains and invite the public in to snap pictures of him until he rips out and takes down the tramway.  And climbs the Empire State Building.  Empire State Building.  Well, what did you say when he said, get the fuck out of my face?  Nothing.  He just took it.  What do you do?  No, you wouldn't have.  Wait, what would you have done?  I want to hear that.  Mike, can I get a picture of you punching me?  There's no need for rudeness.  Yeah, that's exactly what you're going to say. 
[02:45:30]  I would have said there's no call for rudeness.  No call for rudeness.  I said, wow, you really came out of the gate.  Oh, my God, the publicist is panicking.  Uh-oh.  You're panicking on us.  What happened?  She jumped up and told Roland to get him out of here.  Another interview, right?  Because of the Mike Tyson film?  What happened?  No.  Maybe.  I think Mike Tyson just acquired Viacom.  They're doing a movie.  Out of a job now.  You're doing a movie with Mike Tyson.  All right, listen.  Yeah, the Tyson show.  He only has 10 more minutes.  We should at least talk about Employee of the Month.  Yes.  Wasn't Dane in here six or seven times this? 
[02:46:00]  Dane's called.  They told me that he's here all the time.  Yeah, we've had Dane in.  He's called.  We've got a really good relationship with him.  Yeah.  I saw him at the Today Show, and he said he loved you guys.  Well, I saw him at SNL.  Oh.  Did you guys talk to Liza Minnelli?  I tried.  I sang the song loudly behind her.  Yeah.  She appreciated it.  Would you finger her if she gave you the chance?  I don't know that that would be my first choice.  Famous fingering.  Just as a goof.  As a goof?  Yeah, whatever. 
[02:46:30]  Then you could say you got a good story.  Absolutely.  Be a friend.  Yeah.  All right.  It would be worth it.  But yeah, Employee of the Month comes out tomorrow, and it's hilarious.  Obviously, you guys know everyone that's in it.  Harlan Williams.  We don't know Jessica.  You don't?  No, we wouldn't.  Is she cool?  Yeah, she was super nice.  Do you call her Jess?  Because stupid Bob Kelly was calling her Jess, and it was annoying the shit out of me.  No, he wasn't.  Yes, he was.  Yeah.  He goes, no, everyone was there.  Is it Dane, me, Jess, this, and I went, stop. 
[02:47:00]  And I'm going to stop.  Jess.  Do you know Bob?  You might know him.  He's Dane's personal assistant, basically.  Oh, Robert Kelly.  Exactly.  There you go.  Perfect.  I know him from tourgasm.  Yeah.  I don't know him personally.  He probably walked into the room while you guys were there, and he had, like, a towel  draped over his arm and a silver tray, and fetched whatever he ordered.  What stupid scofer he is.  And I guarantee he called her.  This is what an ass Bob is.  He probably didn't realize how inappropriately familiar it was to call her hon. 
[02:47:30]  He probably called her hon.  Hey, hon.  Hey, hon.  Okay, hon.  I'll see you soon, hon.  Like, she's just a regular guy.  No, I don't care who she is.  You know, that Jess is a good girl.  Is she?  No, she's Jess, too.  We want to live through you.  Tell us something about Jessica Simpson.  Um...  Something cool.  You know, I wish she smoked dope.  I bet she'd be higher up on the list than Liza Minnelli.  Are you guys familiar with booty bumps?  Do you know what booty bumps are?  Booty bumps.  Booty, booty, booty, booty, booty.  Yeah, when you put crystal meth in your ass. 
[02:48:00]  Yeah?  Wow.  Yeah, she does booty bumps.  I don't know if she wants everyone to know that, but...  Wow.  No, I didn't find...  Booty bumps?  I, uh...  I don't...  I didn't dig deep enough.  I just had a very nice onset, um, flirted with her without any, um, major interest on  her end.  Uh...  Is she that hot?  Is she that hot in person?  Yeah, I think she's hot.  Well, we all think she's hot, but I'm just saying in person.  Like, what are you looking for?  Like, a number out of ten? 
[02:48:30]  How can I help quantify this?  Like, maybe she's got...  That is the usual gauge.  Maybe she hides...  Well, but let me tell you...  Maybe she hides a big hairy mole under makeup or something.  But is there something you physically look at and you go, oh, wow, I didn't realize  that much.  Oh, wow.  Look at that pimple.  No, I didn't see that.  Unless it's a cock.  But I just want to preface this.  A really bad cavity, maybe, that was done wrong.  She used to have really bad skin, though, didn't she?  She had...  Oh, yeah.  They wanted us to believe that.  According to a paid friggin' endorsement from an infomercial.  I used to be five years ago.  Before I was there, I was on MAD TV.  And they said that she was...  And they said that she had bad...  Wow.  Well, she was probably 16 at the time. 
[02:49:00]  She's been around...  I'm not saying still.  We're trying to have sex with her.  They do have footage of her, probably, with bad skin, like we all have at 16.  Of course.  But my dream girl is Natalie Portman.  So when you ask how much I like Jessica Simpson, it's on the other end of that.  Yeah, the professional.  Before that.  Before the professional.  She was over the hill by the professional.  That's what I was asking.  Yeah, beautiful girl.  She was just...  Oh, Christ.  Old news.  Disturbed individual, man.  All right.  What's your role in Employee of the Month? 
[02:49:30]  I play the head cashier, Vince Downey, who's been Employee of the Month 17 months in a row.  And he's the fastest ring rate in the Southwest region.  Basically, Tom Cruise in Cocktail.  Tom Cruise in Cocktail.  Yeah.  The blonde guy in Karate Kid.  Well, I don't know about the blonde guy.  I don't know, because the underdog guy has to beat you.  Yes.  Okay.  But we hated the blonde guy in Karate Kid.  You're likable?  I think...  Okay.  By the middle, I started becoming a little bit.  Speak for yourself.  Yeah.  Who didn't like him?  You're the best around. 
[02:50:00]  You know, tonight on Carson Daly, I do a karate demonstration to that song.  Get out.  I swear to God.  You're the best around.  Nothing's ever gonna bring you down.  Do you know karate?  Have it.  I pretend to.  All right.  Wait a minute.  I'm looking for...  You're the best.  There it is.  Yeah.  Come on.  Nothing's gonna ever bring you down.  How does this not pump you up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing's gonna ever keep you down.  Sweep the leg.  Makes you want to put on a G.  But Sensei.  Makes you want to lay there in a homoerotic way and have Pat Marie to heal you. 
[02:50:30]  Or that.  I made the mistake of doing the karate demonstration before the interview, and I cut my foot pretty  bad going through a sheet of plywood, and I had to do the rest of the interview with  my foot just dripping blood.  So now I would gather, because you're saying this, you are proficient in the martial arts?  I've studied all the better Chuck Norris films, and I've lifted a lot of his moves.  Yeah.  I basically challenged him to a fight on the show, and then I broke wood with his photograph 
[02:51:00]  glued to the wood.  That'll show him.  Yeah.  Because I'm doing a documentary, and I asked him to come be a part of it for 20 minutes,  and in exchange, I offered to be in his infomercial working out on that crazy piece of exercise  equipment.  On the beach for some reason.  And he turned me down, so I took it personal, and I now want to fight him in the Arby's  parking lot.  Son of a bitch.  I'm a son of a bitch.  I'm looking at his MySpace.  Metallica.  Yeah.  And Christopher Cross.  Bet your balls.  Nah, it's got to be a joke.  It's not a joke. 
[02:51:30]  Christopher Cross.  Sailing.  One of the best songs ever, ever written.  Yeah, but then what?  Take me away.  Then what?  Oh, Ride Like the Wings.  You got Michael McDonald in the background.  All right, then what?  Such a long way to go.  Take it to the border of Mexico, and I'll ride like the wind.  Gonna fucking ride like that wind.  Hey, he rules.  All right.  I mean, how are you going to hate on any artist that has Michael McDonald in the background? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, he is.  He's great.  There we go.  All right.  Then I guess you'll like, what's his name?  Say it.  The guy does the theme music to Caddyshack.  Kenny Loggins.  Kenny Loggins.  Kenny Loggins.  He did a song with Michael McDonald.  Yeah.  Oh, well, and did he produce, um, Shine your light on me.  Yeah.  You are the magic.  You're right where I want to be.  Remember the video for that?  He couldn't have looked more awkward and out of place in a video.  Well, didn't they do a kind of a mock thing where he was playing one of the two characters 
[02:52:30]  in the movie?  He's like, didn't they put him in the Cubs hat?  Yeah, they kind of did that, and he just, he looked like he didn't even want to be there.  Right.  He's not as comfortable as some of your other musicals.  The greatest appearance ever was, uh, when, when, uh, they were on, God damn it, can't  remember the, the show.  70s.  What?  Doobie Brothers.  What?  What?  Was Rerun on the boat?  Rerun.  What's happening?  What's happening?  Oh, yeah, when, uh, when Rerun was, had his tape in the show and it fell out of his 
[02:53:00]  fat.  Boot-legged the, uh, tape of the Doobies.  And, uh.  And he's jumping up and down Fred Berry.  Yeah.  And then falls out and that whole concert stops.  We thought you were our friend, Rerun.  Yeah, the Doobies stopped.  And then they look at his color and they go, oh my God, Melanin.  How cool are we thinking?  Stupid Doobie Brothers.  I'm going to jail for a fat kid eating popcorn.  The guy that had bullied.  Rerun.  You were on the line.  How could you not?  To classic episode.  You remember the name of the goddamn show.  It's probably all about bootlegging and how wrong it is.  Anthony, he's also a fan of House. 
[02:53:30]  House.  I can't watch it because I'm a hypochondriac.  Oh, really?  You don't even have to be a hypochondriac to not want to watch that.  But every time something happens, because it's never like, all right, the guy's coming  in, he's got something gravely wrong with him and it's right off the bat.  That's what it is.  The guy usually comes in going, I got like an itch under my lip.  But, you know, and it turns into like the guy in the bathroom from Poltergeist ripping  his face apart on an all new house.  You know what I like about it, though, is that we all watch it and we try to guess. 
[02:54:00]  Like, I know personally, I try to guess what medical ailment they have.  I don't know anything.  I know it's seven diseases.  You're making diagnoses?  Yeah.  And I'm always trying to leap, like figuring it out.  Like, oh, I got it.  I got it.  It's streptus bacteria.  Definitely.  She has endometriosis and it's cutting off the blood flow.  What is house thinking?  He should know this.  But I actually wish they would steer away from the medical drama.  I like the intra-office affairs that are going on.  That's what I hear is like his stuff, his personal life.  All that is good.  Yeah, I like that.  But they focus too much on the medical thing.  What's his name? 
[02:54:30]  Hew Lariat or something.  What's his name?  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  Well, you know, I read an interview with him the other day and he's a best-selling crime novelist.  Really?  Like, before he was on House, he'd written a couple best-selling thrillers.  House must decide whether five babies must die to save one.  Does he?  Does he have to do that?  And for some reason, he's got to plunge knives into their chest, but at the end, it ends up okay with no malpractice.  It's a good thing he's not black.  That show will be called something different. 
[02:55:00]  Wow, that's three in a row.  What?  That wasn't bad.  I always like...  That wasn't so bad.  Let's go to New Orleans.  Dave, what's up?  Let's go to the Eye of a Hurricane.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I saw the Employee of the Month last night.  It was funny to tell, but that was kind of a prick in the movie, too.  Oh, you're kind of a...  But did you laugh at the prick?  I laughed my ass off.  There you go.  A funny prick is still likable.  Yep.  Saw the trailer during the Jackass movie. 
[02:55:30]  And Ron was good, too.  He was funny, too.  They all did good.  Just as fine, fine, fine.  Big ditty.  All right.  Thanks a lot, man.  There you go.  Good liking the movie.  Does he have to go?  He said, I'm a prick.  That was nice.  They're nodding.  You have to go.  Oh, Roland's shaking his head.  I'm having such a good time, though.  People are calling up here and calling me a prick.  I know.  Yeah, right?  Stick around.  Why wouldn't you want to stay for that?  What do you got next?  What show?  What show?  I don't know.  It's all a blur. 
[02:56:00]  I was...  Where are they going next?  Where does that show tape out of?  It's all a blur.  Everything's out of focus.  It's out of an RV down by the river.  It's all a blur.  What a great thing to do.  Where are you going next?  I'm starting that.  What?  Serious radio.  Are you kidding?  What show on Serious?  That's all right.  You've got to promote.  I think I have my own show on Serious.  Hey, is it the Wise Guy Show?  Well, you should get that.  Hey, so are you whacking someone?  Hey, you want to have cannoli?  We've got some cannolis in my job.  You don't show the employee the month. 
[02:56:30]  Yuck.  Hey, employee the month.  You know, he gets whacked.  Let me tell you.  I got where I go.  Shut up.  We get it.  I worked for some of the shoe salesmen.  You were on The Sopranos.  We get it.  Yeah.  Another whacked joke to tie it in, would you?  Thanks.  All right, let's say thanks to Dax.  Hey, thanks for having me.  Dax, thanks for coming in.  I know we started off on a rocky footing there, but I really enjoyed it.  You turned it around, didn't you?  Did he turn it around?  He did good.  The second I saw he was in a movie that I enjoyed, I was happy to have you. 
[02:57:00]  Thanks a lot for having me, guys.  Thanks for coming in.  It's Dax Shepard.  Employee of the Month opens Friday wide.  Rackle.  Friday.  You want a break?  Hey.  Thank you, Dax.  You're just leaving like that?  I thought you were going to make it at home.  Now, look.  He called you handsome.  You get all upset, and now you're all sad that he's leaving.  I don't like a lion.  I don't like a lion.  Yeah, really.  That opens.  It's just a heavy door.  Are you guys on break now or not?  We're going.  Yeah, we're on break.  That was good.  Wait, I want a picture with you.  Let's do a picture while we're on break. 
[02:57:30]  Picture time.  Picture time.  Good shot, Waller.  Jimmy takes pictures.  So if I go to this place between now and Saturday, what's the best flavor of this?  I like the turkey chili.  Turkey chili?  Yeah.  And five bean chili.  Pumpkin.  They're all good.  Turkey.  The lobster bisque.  Sorry, God.  I don't know why there's an alligator head next to it.  I'll cover this photo.  Yeah.  Jimmy is...  All right.  Thanks, Dax.  He loves his celebrity photos.  Thanks, man.  Bye, miss.  Dax Shepard, everybody.  Bye, lady. 
[02:58:00]  Roland, how'd that go?  There she goes.  It went very well.  Why don't you...  Yeah, sit down, Roland.  We like a little critiquing sometimes on actors that come in and have interviews with us.  Yeah.  How did it go?  Very well.  You were out there with the publicist.  Were they commenting on the interview at all?  They were laughing.  They were laughing?  So they were relaxed?  They were relaxed.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  It's just that he has to do a lot more interviews before he leaves back to L.A.  Well, with the film opening...  When? 
[02:58:30]  White Friday.  Right.  What is the movie about?  I haven't seen it.  You didn't get it out of him, so...  I haven't seen it yet.  I don't read it.  What else is coming out this weekend?  Oh, I saw The Departed last night.  Well, but we want to know what this is about.  Why are you not on air more?  Yeah.  I saw The Departed or anything.  Why he's on air, though.  Just sit back and enjoy.  What's it about?  Wait.  I got...  Oh, the Employee of the Month?  Right.  Yeah, what?  Dax's character is like the star employee, and Dane is like the slacker that wants Jessica 
[02:59:00]  Simpson.  But Dax is dating her in the movie, so they compete.  Couldn't have said it better myself, man.  See, you're onto it.  I like how...  This guy is great behind the scenes.  He gets some unbelievable guests for our show.  He got his Matthew Modine today.  There's a great example.  Did he book you?  I don't even know.  You're just a friend of the show.  No, I didn't know who to talk to. 
[02:59:30]  He's our booker.  And back in the day, we didn't have real guests on our show for the most part.  We didn't have movie stars.  He's getting everybody.  But we noticed when he goes in front of a microphone, it's a completely different story.  Well, the funniest thing is what you were pointing to things on the paper.  Right.  And almost trying to make it seem like you're making up, yet there's a camera right to your  left.  Yeah.  And it was just like, and Dane is the good guy.  Well, you saw The Departed.  Everyone's talking about The Departed.  Oh, you saw that?  Yeah.  Three and a half stars in the paper today.  I'd love a review.  Probably one of the best movies out I've seen in a long time. 
[03:00:00]  DiCaprio, probably Oscar nominated.  Nicholson was awesome.  His crazy look in half the movie, he just goes nuts.  Nicholson does a crazy look in a movie?  Wow.  Yes.  Give us a brief, but without blowing it, brief little synopsis and your opinion on the performances.  Yeah, Scorsese gave away a huge...  Marty?  Marty.  Yeah, and Conan, he gave away a big part of the movie. 
[03:00:30]  But it's just, uh, uh, Matt Damon is, uh, is taking, uh, Jack Nicholson takes Matt Damon  under his wing as a kid, and he helps to raise him.  So Jack plays a bird.  You're wrong.  All right, wait.  Well, let's get a little...  Yeah, let's get this an option.  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't interrupt.  One of the best movies you've ever seen, so, uh...  Um, just Jack Nicholson takes place in Boston, and, uh, just, uh, Matthew, Matt Damon, and 
[03:01:00]  Leo go to Police Academy, and they become, like, detectives, and shenanigans happen.  Shenanigans happen?  Wow.  Shenanigans.  Lucky we're on XM.  The Departed.  The best shenanigans.  Shenanigans happen.  What do you mean...  I can see bumper stickers all over. 
[03:01:30]  Shenanigans happen.  I don't know.  That's the only thing that came to my head.  Um...  Shenanigans happen?  Fucking showed up in your head?  An anvil should come to your head.  How about this?  Give us an example of a shenanigan.  All right.  Excellent question.  That's a great word, shenanigans.  Um...  Next person who says shenanigans.  Well, DiCaprio and Damon were in the bar fight scene together, so...  Things ensued.  And...  Nicholson came in screaming... 
[03:02:00]  Stuff.  And...  Good movie.  Are you filling in for Ebert at any point soon?  Give us an example of a shenanigan.  It doesn't have to be from a movie.  Just...  I don't know.  You used that fine word.  Let's finish it from here.  Hello, I'm Roger Ebert, and this gets a thumb up from me.  How do you feel? 
[03:02:30]  The same.  I want to know what a shenanigan is.  That's a good point.  A lot of our listeners might not know.  They know.  I don't know.  Let's go to Michelle in Buffalo.  Michelle.  Hey, guys.  I got two comments.  One for O and one for A.  Okay.  First one is for O.  You know, you're killing me, man.  You mispronounced words left and right.  There is a V in unbelievable.  I'm not sure if you knew that, but just had to tell you.  You're killing me.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, thank you.  Are you...  What are you saying? 
[03:03:00]  Are you a schoolteacher, Zahn?  I'm a speech pathologist.  Who gives a shit?  I know you don't.  Listen, the other thing is...  Do you know that I make a...  I forget it.  Yes.  I make a good living, we'll say, being a communicator.  How do you like them apples?  So does Karen Meyers.  Miss $12 an hour.  Oh, wow.  You bastard.  Wow.  I thought I had her.  What else there, Michelle?  Okay.  And this one's for Anthony.  You know, I know you guys always hear that, you know, Opie's the good-looking one, 
[03:03:30]  but I just want to say I think Anthony's hotter.  There, Anthony, I think you're so hot, man.  Oh, thank you.  And my husband might be listening.  This is at the expense of a divorce.  I mean, my husband might be listening, saying, oh, my God, I'm going to kill...  I'm a newlywed.  He's going to kill me.  But, Anthony, you're hotter.  Thank you.  Coming from the blind girl from the movie Mask.  That's right.  That's right.  Well, don't you want to tell me something?  You can be negative.  Yeah.  Yeah, add Jimmy in.  I met you in Los Angeles, Jimmy. 
[03:04:00]  I went to your Lucky Louie screenings, and I believe you...  Have you been tested?  Oh, wow.  You believe he did?  No, he did.  He did.  I don't know.  What would have drawn my eyes away from your cleavage?  Was your head on fire?  Yeah.  But, you know, what's funny is I think he took to my husband more than me.  It seemed like you were cuddling more with him.  It was really weird, but...  All right.  Yeah.  I had to ask.  Thanks, Michelle.  Yeah, thanks, guys.  Go practice your R's.  Yeah.  Okay.  Hey, Michelle. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah.  Good one.  Fell right into your trap.  Oh, she did.  Clever one.  Fucking...  Plus the palate first.  Another terrific appearance by you today.  Oh, thank you.  Tomorrow's Dink Cook is calling in.  Ah!  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Cool.  Bring up some Barry Katz references with him.  I almost did that to Dax if he didn't have to leave.  You know Barry Katz is lurking around the set.  Dax, you're unbelievable, man. 
[03:05:00]  You are the next big thing.  You've got to create holy shit moments, Dax.  On Punk, when you were kicking those guys in the nuts, that was incredible.  Incredible.  That's an amazing impression.  Yep.  You know who did it?  Too bad no one knows.  You know who did it, too?  On Chappelle's show?  Oh, yeah.  Elon Gold played him, and I heard it was just brutally real.  Yeah, he was in the wheelchair, and he knocks him down.  And the best thing is, Elon Gold goes, not the stairs, man. 
[03:05:30]  That was incredible, guys.  Ryan.  Yo, what's up?  Hi.  Hi, Ryan.  Hey.  Jimmy had a good point last caller.  Send her to Chicago, where she could put the youth.  Karen Meyer.  I didn't say that.  Or Anthony, maybe?  I don't know.  Anyway, I got something for Frank.  Wow.  Oh, anyway, you think you're going to slide away with a, more importantly.  All right.  I had the Karen Meyer. 
[03:06:00]  Maybe if I should have said this.  So did Karen Meyer.  Maybe I should have done it like that.  There you go.  Then people would know it was me.  Why?  Like Frank Madden.  Yeah.  I got something for Madden over there.  I got an impression for you.  Oh, I can't wait.  All right.  Here's Terry Shivo.  Ready?  I'm playing.  That's it.  Terry Vader.  That's not bad.  Terry Shivo.  Now do your impression of Pyle in the bathroom. 
[03:06:30]  That's my whole life.  I have this great impression for you.  It's time to take a break.  There goes the flow of the show.  Thanks, sir.  I got a lot of negative feedback, by the way, about my Terry feedback material on the HBO  special.  Oh, really?  A lot of people didn't care for it.  Go fuck them.  Oh, please.  Go shit in your hat.  Go shit in your hat.  I don't see you getting much of that.  Oh, when you say go fuck them, I mean the invalids was their dumb mouths just hang off the  side of the bed.  How do you resist?  Take the feeding tube out. 
[03:07:00]  Straighten them right out.  Show them who's boss.  You came up with a great solution, though, for that problem.  That's true.  That's something to do with fuck it.  I haven't done the material.  I haven't done the jokes since then.  I just...  No, it was a way that she could earn a living and put her to good use.  It was...  Wasn't it sponsoring Colgate?  Oh, some toothpaste?  Oh, yeah.  Some dumb teeth they kept showing?  All they were showing were her teeth because she kind of...  Sorry.  Ah, well.  Let's do a one-year-old dated joke.  Oh, I know. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, she's dead.  Let it be.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come.  Oh, we'll be in the end today.  Here we go.  Waka, waka.  Fuck it.  He, he, he, he, he, he.  Hey.  What the fuck is that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I like that.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:08:00]  I can't believe it.  Are you insane?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, goddamn.  All right.  Say what again?  Come on.  Say what?  What?  Fuck the fuck.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Oh.  Oh.  Did you retreat?  Fuck it.  Hey. 
[03:08:30]  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  Oh, hey.  All right, we're back with the O&A show.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[03:09:00]  Let's go to Bill in Kansas. Bill.  Yes, greetings, gentlemen.  I wanted to know if you'd heard that fantastic sweeper Ron and Fez have made by Don Wiki Wicklin.  Is it good?  Oh, it's fantastic. Give it a listen.  All right, we'll listen to it. I have not heard this.  Not heard.  Thanks for bringing it to our attention, Bill.  Here it is.  Man. 
[03:09:30]  XM-202, Ron and Fez.  XM-202, Ron and Fez.  Fuck Opie and Anthony.  Oh.  Well.  Now I don't think we're kidding around.  Last time was just a joke.  Man.  This time, we're really mad at Ron and Fez.  So start speculating.  Idiots.  All right.  Is there a problem between the shows? 
[03:10:00]  No, Mommy still loves Daddy. Don't worry.  Start insulting Ron and Fez, but just say things they do.  Yeah, man. Why don't you just call him Fez?  Fez.  Yeah.  We got a comic heckled by two women.  Steve, what's this about?  A comic heckled by two women?  I don't know.  He was sort of explaining it during the break.  What, did he have no arms?  Danny, you do it.  You get fists?  What happened?  You teach him.  I just coughed up a nasty thing.  Oh, God.  Wait, what happened? 
[03:10:30]  Shut up. Let him get out of here.  He coughed up.  He was a little phlegmy.  Something is fucked in his throat.  He coughed up...  A tooth?  No, probably just like a lunger.  Like a Fleming Younger.  A lunger.  I'm sorry.  Danny, what do we got?  Apparently this comedian's name is James Inman, and this was at the Seattle.  I know, Inman.  Yeah, he was at the Seattle Comedy Underground.  Trump Seattle, yeah.  Is he?  James Inman is from Seattle, yes.  Okay.  I thought you were just repeating what he said real quickly afterwards, so you sounded like you know everything. 
[03:11:00]  No, he actually called me a while ago. He was in the Veil Comedy Festival. He's a little nuts.  James is a little crazy. I haven't seen him in years, but he's a funny guy, but he's just a little nuts.  He's got little nuts?  No, no, I wouldn't say that.  So he was using the word towelhead, and there were some women in the crowd that didn't appreciate him.  Oh, you stupid. Why do they show up at a comedy show then?  What do you expect from Seattle, man? It's a very liberal city.  Yeah, man.  Go take some heroin and shut up. 
[03:11:30]  Shouldn't you accept that you're going to hear some really awful things when you go to a comedy show?  You're going to a comedy show.  I don't get it.  I don't think you should be allowed to say anything at a comedy show.  Unless it's being billed as a squeaky clean, rated G, don't worry about this.  Unless it's being billed that way, you have no right when you walk into a comedy club to fucking bitch or be offended at anything.  If you don't like it, get up quietly and leave.  Don't fucking yell back, don't like towelhead. Fuck them. 
[03:12:00]  Because these dummies think they're part of the creative process.  You're not.  Your job is to sit and watch, either laugh or don't laugh.  Those are your options.  If you don't like it, quietly fucking get out.  Leave.  Because other people are enjoying it.  Oh, they make that noise.  Hey!  They have to let you know that they disapprove.  Because they somehow think that they're equals in this situation.  You're not.  You're a fucking, you're a spectator. 
[03:12:30]  They would yell at the movies, but they know the movie can't hear them, and they're not quite that sociopathically stupid.  Yeah.  In Philly, at Helium, I was watching Jimmy, and he got one of those, oh!  And Jimmy just punished.  I'll get nastier and meaner, and I'll tell them that that's not an option.  I don't want to hear it.  Because I'm not, honest to God, I'm not interested in their opinions.  I don't know how Inman handled this, but it should have been with absolute venom, because he's in the right. 
[03:13:00]  Good.  Jimmy turns to the side, starts spitting, and he just punished the audience.  I have, Esty looked at me one time, and I, well, I don't mean to do this, but I get so angry on stage.  I really do at times hate them so much that I have to spit, and I want to spit on the audience.  You're like a cobra.  I, really, yeah.  Or a llama.  Or a hooker.  And I just, I just turn, and I spit as I walk off the stage.  And Esty one time looked at me like I had just took my dick out. 
[03:13:30]  I'm like, I can't believe I just did that in front of her.  Why would I spit on the stage?  Spitting on the stage.  Yeah.  They spits on their own stage.  I try to make them coffee while I'm reading acting books.  Well, here we go.  So far, so good, right? 
[03:14:00]  I don't give a fuck.  It's hard to listen.  Yes.  It's a hard listen.  It's not a racist comic.  It's not a racial, it's not a racial slut.  Any race can wear a towel on your head.  White, black, blue, blue, Asian.  Shut the fuck up.  I'm going to finish this joke.  Any race can wear a towel on your head.  It's not a fucking towel.  What?  It's not a towel.  It's a fucking piece of cloth. 
[03:14:30]  That's what a towel is.  I say towelhead.  It's a fucking joke.  Let me finish my joke.  And you shut the fuck up.  What?  Get out.  Are you joking?  Oh, shit.  All right, let me finish the joke.  It's not a racial slur.  Yes, it is.  No, it's not.  If you shut up, I'll finish the joke.  All right, so shut the fuck up.  Or I'll start talking about women.  I don't think I'm going, what?  Women are the first.  Whatever the other guy's looking at it, 
[03:15:00]  if I'm making sex is bullshit jokes.  Cunt, how about that?  Oh, nice.  You're a cunt.  You won't shut the fuck up.  You talk too much.  All right, if my cloth was in your mouth,  maybe that would shut you up.  Oh, shit.  Fuck you.  You're a cunt.  Oh, my God.  That is funny.  Like, you're going to hurt me?  Get the fuck on the stage.  Oh.  What are you doing?  If I apologize, will you shut the fuck up? 
[03:15:30]  What the fuck is this?  I can't believe it.  I got two women on stage trying to beat me.  No.  No, you just shut up during my show.  Get off the stage.  It's just another word.  Joke.  It's just another word.  Freedom of speech.  That's where it ends?  Well, when the crowd went kind of crazy in the middle there, that was when she actually  jumped up on stage and swung at him and tried to hit him in the face.  Good for him.  Wow.  He tore that.  And she is a cunt. 
[03:16:00]  It's all she'll ever be.  And good for fucking Inman.  He tore her apart.  That's exactly what you should handle it with venom.  And towards the end, her friend, I guess whoever she was with, they're both on stage,  like, wanting an apology from him for calling them cunts.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Meanwhile, the guy's in the middle of his act.  He's just trying to handle it.  But you don't even need to explain.  Like, it's almost like, it's so, they so deserve it.  I mean, it's like, to even think you should apologize, I'm glad I didn't.  Just shut the fuck up.  That's what you should do.  Rachel's are.  Exactly. 
[03:16:30]  And you're a cunt.  Shut up.  Bobby Slayton got fucking slugged one time on a gig we were doing years ago in the Annapolis  Dinner Theater.  It was O.J.'s fucking Bronco weekend.  That's how I remember it.  And Bobby called some girl in the audience a cunt because she was behaving as such.  And I went outside in a batch trying to make out with a waitress who might, who might have  been a four.  Might have been.  She was a fat, like, but her name should have been Betty if it wasn't.  She had Betty girl hairdo.  Just killable.  She's a four on her birthday. 
[03:17:00]  On her birthday, she's a four.  Yeah.  And I walk in the fucking front door again and Slayton goes, where were you, man?  You missed it.  And I'm like, what?  Because the bouncers were all there.  He goes, they had to throw some guy at it.  He punched me in the face.  That girl's boyfriend slugged him.  And then Slayton fucking belled to the guy back.  It was like a big to-do over the C-word.  Fucking dumb broads getting so sensitive.  And then if you're the guy and you don't stick up for the girl, then you gotta, like, do something.  Sometimes it helps.  Instead of just telling her, shut up.  Oh, yeah.  There's nothing worse than when the whole crowd hates you. 
[03:17:30]  Like, at least they were behind Inman.  But when the whole crowd doesn't like you and people start in, you really do feel like they're bigger than me.  But you still have to- you have to- you have to wreck all their nights.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At the comedy salon, I had a fucking table teaming up on me.  It was young guys who just didn't like what I was doing.  And then older woman.  And boy, did I fucking listen to her.  I, of course, attacked her looks, which no woman in her 40s wants to hear.  No.  And I attacked them and go, fuck it.  That's how you do it, man.  Because you know what you do, try to grovel and make them laugh? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  It's like, they've already decided, I already don't respect the way they are, so why should I fucking whore myself and make them laugh?  What are they doing there?  They're dummies!  Do you ever ask them, what the fuck are you doing here?  And these phony motherfuckers, none of them ever would go to a rap concert and fucking heckle the ideology of one of the rappers.  Oh, but be shot.  But they wouldn't do it.  They wouldn't go to an all-black comedy club.  And when he was talking about nigger this or white this and fucking, I don't think that.  They go to a safe place.  It's like these fucking phony alternative fucks who go into a room full of alternative-minded people and talk all this shit about Larry the Cable Guy. 
[03:18:30]  Fuck you.  You know, you're preaching to the people who think exactly like you do.  You're not taking any risks.  Yeah.  They don't fucking take any chances.  They're just fucking pussies, man.  I agree.  Look what you walked into, Mike.  Where'd you go?  This is worse than the Karen Meyer stuff.  Let's go to Mike in Tampa.  That bitch.  Mike?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Mike.  Hey there, Mike.  I missed the big announcement yesterday. 
[03:19:00]  My roadie took a crap on me, and I just got a new one from good old Radio Shack, and I was wondering what happened, man.  Well, Mike, they teased that announcement for what, a week or so?  Yeah.  You must have heard the promo's big announcement coming, right?  Oh, yeah.  You ready for it?  Yes.  The name of the channel is called what?  High Voltage.  Wow.  It's not going to be called High Voltage anymore.  No, no. 
[03:19:30]  Let's get to reaction.  It's going to be called The Virus.  Act one.  Calm down.  Calm down.  I will sleep over that.  Whoa, whoa.  Hey, calm down.  We understand how excited you are about this.  And that was only the second biggest announcement.  The biggest announcement, which no one could believe, was that they were going to change the track lighting in the bathroom.  For a while there, it was overhead fluorescent, but then they're going to put it in a certain track.  They said it will kind of light it better. 
[03:20:00]  Fucking I love you, Jimmy.  You're the best.  It's just been an amazing couple of days here at XM.  Yeah.  And Eric Logan also kind of hinted that he might be changing the route he drives to work on.  Yeah.  I mean, we didn't want to get too crazy and impress him.  But that's tentative.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can't tell you how many people call and wondering what the big announcement was.  The big announcement.  Well, there it is.  Yeah.  Are you excited, Mike?  I'm ecstatic.  Thank you, guys.  You suck.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Now he's got to turn up the radio to hear himself. 
[03:20:30]  I have to go, guys.  Take care.  What?  I've got to catch my plane.  Not allowed.  Not allowed.  I've got to be on an aircraft.  You are not allowed.  I've got to be on an aircraft.  No.  You're going to West Palm?  Yes.  I had a Joel for me.  Oh, yeah.  He's a fun guy.  You're playing at the...  At the...  The improvisation.  The improv in West Palm.  Yeah.  Sid Rosenberg called me while we were on the air over there.  Yeah.  So maybe I'll do his show. 
[03:21:00]  I think he's down there.  Is he?  Florida, yeah.  You better get there quick.  Maniac he is.  Could be gone by the time you get there.  Yeah, before he gets kicked off.  Sid's alone.  Fucking...  Wow.  I'm going to do his show.  All right.  And I'll do the afternoon show, I think, on tomorrow.  You know, in Pittsburgh, they were trying to get me to do the competing morning show.  What?  Why would...  I don't know.  Well, you could go in there and just sabotage it.  I thought of that, but I actually liked the guys there.  They were cool guys.  They weren't trying to be dicks.  They knew I was Mopey and Anthony.  You're such a good guy.  They were cool having me on.  They weren't...  They're not Jerkoffs.  I bet when you left, they said, that Jimmy Norton, he's swell. 
[03:21:30]  No, what they say is, he's a mensch.  Oh.  He's a mensch.  And I said, don't give me that Jew talk.  They go, I'm sorry.  All right, Jimmy.  Bye, guys.  See you, Frank.  West Palm Beach.  Good luck on that amendment.  I will try hard.  Improv.  West Palm Beach.  Yeah.  We'll see Jimmy Monday.  Goes Jimmy.  Unless my plane crashes, then you won't.  No, shut up.  See you, boys.  Oh.  Godspeed.  He truly does lead in a blaze. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  There he goes, little Jimmy, on another one of his little comedy adventures.  When is he going to give up this comedy dream of his?  Just stick to radio.  I want to hit the road.  You want to hit the road, too?  It must be fun.  It's not fun.  It's got to suck.  We hit the road for a little while.  It was kind of fun.  It has to suck.  Honestly, I got no respect for you guys, because we...  Well, from what I heard, because I couldn't make a couple things work. 
[03:22:30]  I talked to trying to do a couple of them, and a couple things just didn't work out,  and we were just trying to...  But then I heard that people were just going crazy at them, and they're just...  No, there were a couple of casualties.  See, to me, I don't care, because I just go up there.  Now, if something like that...  Because those...  You do all right with those.  One day, you go up there 15 minutes or whatever.  Yeah.  15...  You can tank for 15 minutes, and nobody ever cares.  I mean, people can be booing you.  As long as they don't throw any stuff, they can hurt you.  For the most part, though, we had great audiences. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  Just every once in a while.  Yeah.  I don't know what the word is out there, but...  For the most part...  A Bill Burr on YouTube thing.  It's amazing.  It is something that every comedian should watch.  It's amazing.  It's been viewed 112,000 times.  Really?  In less than a month.  Wow.  It's crazy.  Every day, still, 1,000 to 2,000 views on this thing.  That's almost like one idiot to what I get on it.  He took a vicious crowd.  No, you got a crowd.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.  And turned it around.  He turned it around with it?  He turned it around by laying into an audience. 
[03:23:30]  And not a comedy club audience.  He's talking thousands upon thousands of people.  And just...  It was Philly, right?  Yeah.  Camden Show in Jersey.  And just...  Outside Philly.  ...laid into them...  Like I've never seen a comic lay into an audience.  And non-stop.  He could not be...  He was a machine.  He was a machine.  And by the time he was done and left the stage, they gave him a standing ovation.  He wrecked them.  Wrecked them.  Wrecked 10,000 people.  Jeez.  By the end, he was getting a standing ovation. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, standing ovation.  By most of the people.  He turned them completely around.  His knowledge of Philly...  Was downright scary.  Disturbing.  How he was pulling shit out of his ass about Philly to just screw these people with.  You gotta see it.  Yeah, it's on YouTube.  I'm gonna look.  Great.  Take a look.  Just throw Bill Byrne in the search engine.  Today, it's up to 111,000 views.  Isn't that thing amazing, YouTube?  The whole thing is just...  Ah, this internet thing.  I always said that, you know, I think radio, like 10 years ago, wasn't as great as TV. 
[03:24:30]  Now I think it's as great, if not better, because you can just go to the internet, you  can see the pictures you want, and the radio, you get to meet the people and talk.  Like, TV's always gotta be in, like, four-minute snippets and stuff like that.  Radio, you get to understand who people are, you get to, you know, all that.  And then if you wanna see who they are, if you're a fan, you get to see them all, all  the stuff on YouTube or whatever, whether it's the website, any of that kind of stuff.  And it's just, it's totally a different thing.  And it's in little, you know, self-serve segments that if you wanna see this, you can see it. 
[03:25:00]  If you don't, you don't have to.  And any subject matter, anything you wanna see...  I spend more time on YouTube than watching regular TV now.  I'll start trying to watch something on TV, like, ugh, then I get the laptop and I'll  go to YouTube.  And like we've discussed a few times here, you start on one subject, next thing you know,  you're on some bizarre thing, like, how did I get here?  Yeah, because it's like a tree of subjects and you end up way over on the other end.  Usually in pornography somehow, how it ends that way. 
[03:25:30]  Usually.  What percentage doesn't end up there?  You started with cookies and ended with snacks.  But YouTube is huge and they don't have the smut angle.  And people are just using it like crazy.  Yeah, that's true.  Because people like seeing people do stupid things.  I think people are hoping for smut on there.  They're just, maybe this got through.  Oh.  Yeah, every so often you look and go ahead.  Just the Calando Madden Bush.  I saw this last night, but oh, it was removed.  Wait, this is the one where Frank does get naked. 
[03:26:00]  There are porn versions of this service.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, we'll take a break.  We got Frank Calando.  I actually got to run now.  Now you're leaving.  All right.  The reason I came in, because I didn't say goodbye, so I wanted to say goodbye.  I thought that was weird.  We were kind of having a thing during the break.  A thing.  And then I looked down to see where we were going next.  I look up, you're gone.  I'm like, I think you just left on us.  No, no, no.  I had to go do some, I had to do a phoner with somebody, so I had to go do that.  Ah.  With who?  Tony Bruno, XM guy.  Sports.  Do we know Tony Bruno?  What channel? 
[03:26:30]  One of the sports.  Let me guess, you had to do Madden.  Oh, yeah.  Believe me.  Oh, yeah.  You understand what most of my life is?  It's talking like this.  Yeah.  Or a lot like this.  Or sometimes like this.  Yeah.  And basically, you know, he's pretty good with me and stuff like that.  He's actually a good friend and stuff like that.  Yeah.  But it's like, rarely, it's always fun to come in with guys you know.  Because like you guys, I can just sit and talk for a little bit.  You work stuff in.  You find out, you know, he worked this in.  And then we can talk as normal human beings. 
[03:27:00]  There's a lot of places that don't.  It's just, you know, press A, B, C. See ya.  Thank you.  Yeah.  It's like, well, can I even get the plugs in?  You know, did I come here just to be the best entertainment on your show today?  You know, not like on a – these are like these terrible – I call a lot of them  radio stations.  They're radio for ladies.  Radio.  I like radio.  That's good.  We call them shows with holes because there's always the guy and the hole that adds nothing  to the program. 
[03:27:30]  Well, they've got their promos and stuff.  They make themselves sound like a real edgy show.  It's like, hey, we've got Frank Caliendo.  How you doing, Frank?  And then they just stare at you and then they expect you to, you know, carry the show for  20 minutes without them even participating.  See, we try to do it different.  We try to make it a hang.  Well, yeah.  I mean, definitely you did today because like at the beginning on Terrestrial, you guys  didn't even really talk to me for the first time.  Yeah.  I was like – you know how much I was sweating?  And I was like, oh, God.  I hope I get to – I didn't fly in all night to do this. 
[03:28:00]  To sit on this fucking red couch.  The red couch killed me.  You did great today.  No, it was great.  You really did.  And it was cool with Matthew Modine forcing me into little bits and stuff.  Yeah.  When it's Matthew Modine.  Ah, you got to give it up for him.  Well, Opie used to do that too.  He used to do that.  You go, what would –  Oh, wow.  It's before you learn – I try to help you guys out a little bit.  No, but it's before people learn how to use me and realize, hey, I can actually talk as  myself some and then I can work the voices in two.  It's like that kind of a thing. 
[03:28:30]  So it's always cool.  So when you go to the radio stations though, they don't know about you as a person.  Well, the people – I mean, sometimes they don't – a lot of times people have no  idea who I am.  And then they're like, oh, that's a great President Bush.  I know.  It's been on TV for five years now.  Yeah, ass.  It's – you don't want to be a – you don't want to be a jerk about it.  Make a soundboard out of it.  Yeah.  Just so people can push buttons.  We were going to have Frank here, but – you know what too?  They were going to – during a break over there, they were going to do some drops for  you guys.  I'll have to do that sometime.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, really fast, before you leave, someone is saying Rubber Johnny, best YouTube ever. 
[03:29:00]  What's Rubber Johnny?  Rubber Johnny.  I guess we'll find out.  Could you throw Rubber Johnny?  You got it.  Rubber Johnny.  What is this?  There's people getting like commercials out of that stuff now.  I know.  Did you see the guy who does the fake Copperfield thing who's doing like the car commercials?  That's a Google video and YouTube video.  Like he's got an – it's an outside elevator going up and he's just pretending to be Copperfield 
[03:29:30]  and he goes like – moves his hands up.  And it's like he's pretending to move the elevator.  It's all stuff that's automated.  And it's a great YouTube bit.  And now he's got a commercial.  He must be making thousands of it.  Wow.  Yeah, that's where they're looking for the talent, you know?  Let's say hi to Brad and Jersey.  Very few and far between, though, I got to tell you.  It's mostly just dumb kids punching each other in the face, which is really entertaining,  too.  Brad?  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  What's up, Brad?  I just want to know if Frank can do a quick Brian Regan before he leaves.  Of course I can.  What is it, the virus? 
[03:30:00]  It's a fucking virus here.  Can I say that?  Look, can you swear on – you can swear on the XM, you dirty, dirty vagina.  That's just trying to be dirtier.  I know.  And that's dirtier than he'd ever be.  It's just hard to do it.  And I'm going to get a call from him, probably.  Like, why'd you do that?  Why – you know, he would never be that mean.  Like, Frank, can I talk to you?  I know, yeah.  Hey, can I talk to you for a second?  Bob up and down a little bit.  What are you – you know, kind of messing with my –  Oh, forget it.  Rubber Johnny stinks. 
[03:30:30]  Rubber Johnny is some stupid, weird, freaky video that isn't worth watching.  It's a music video for some shit techno song.  Oh, I hate those.  Then don't put on Rubber Johnny.  All right, let's –  You're putting on Rubber Johnny.  Let's go to David in Arizona.  David.  Hey, Frank, I just wanted to say hi.  The other day I saw you over at Circuit City, and you just stopped real quick and said hello.  That was real cool.  That was from Arizona.  Oh, okay, cool.  Where – at Circuit City.  How long ago was that? 
[03:31:00]  That was a long ago.  Yeah, I thought you said the other day.  Circuit City, you stopped – like you were coming out as I was going in?  Yeah, that's correct.  See?  I know.  You were probably wearing khakis coming out while I was going in, or it was by the DVDs.  No, no, no.  I remember.  I remember because you said, hey, you're Frank Caliendo.  And I went something like –  Yeah.  I just said like, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  No, but I remember.  You're on the phone.  You kind of ignored me, but you turned around and put your hand out and – man, very nice. 
[03:31:30]  And smacked me.  I don't think he was – I don't think he was purposely ignoring you.  I think he had a phone call.  I mean, you're on the phone and you were performing surgery.  Hey, I'm on the phone.  I'm on the phone, guy.  You live in here now in Arizona?  Yeah, I do live out there.  My whole family.  We live on –  So you and Doug Stanhope now?
