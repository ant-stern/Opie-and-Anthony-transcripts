<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts mocking racially insensitive vintage cigarette advertisements.  A caller, John from Jersey, offered commentary on Anthony's dog preferences, followed by a discussion of a theory suggesting the Marlboro logo resembled KKK hoods.  The show then devolved into crude jokes about a child with a brain tumor petting a dolphin, transitioning into a satirical, offensively stereotypical discussion of a politician's proposal to diversify hurricane names.  This was followed by playing and mocking clips from 1950s sex education films, prompting listener calls sharing experiences with forced nudity during school swimming.  The segment concluded with a discussion about a Staten Island animal shelter euthanizing kittens, punctuated by the hosts' laughter.

The next segment started with continued discussion about the kitten euthanasia, focusing on the pronunciation of words with hard "T" sounds. This segued into news stories: an 86-year-old repeatedly calling 911 about pizza delivery, a 47-year-old Christian school teacher arrested for prostitution, and a first-time prostitution case in Peoria linked to Richard Pryor's family. A caller inquired about Dee's underwear preference, furthering the "T" sound discussion and a digression about the word "satin."  The segment’s focus shifted to a dramatic confrontation with Bernie Getz, a regular guest. Opie seemingly destroyed Bernie's music CD (later revealed as a prank), leading to Bernie's angry outburst and temporary exit from the studio.  After the prank was revealed, Bernie returned. The remainder of the segment included discussion of Bernie's outburst, further news stories (including articles about Vikings and "Caucasian History Month"), and a mocking discussion of the Maury Povich Show, focusing on its portrayal of individuals with physical differences and disabilities. Billy Byrne and some of Joe Rogan’s material were mentioned; this segment also featured the hosts in the studio with guests Billy Byrne.

A subsequent segment heavily featured listener-submitted audio and calls.  The audio involved a woman being subjected to a dildo attached to a power drill. Callers reacted with varying levels of shock, humor, and outrage. Other segments included insensitive interviews with a young woman with a severe skin condition and a young girl with facial disfigurement, alongside Jim Norton's vulgar recounting of a negative experience with a paid escort.  The show also discussed a 57-year-old woman expecting twins, with insensitive comments about her age and decision.  No guests were explicitly named besides the hosts and Jim Norton.


The show continued with a discussion about the 60-year-old pregnant woman,  followed by an extensive discussion of Steve, the production guy, and his fictional character, Ramone, a houseboy.  The hosts and staff (including interns Danny and Nathaniel) developed Ramone's backstory, creating radio promos featuring him.  A call-in segment followed, featuring listener anecdotes about disastrous holiday experiences.  Nathaniel, an intern, briefly reviewed his stand-up routine within this segment.

The final segment began with Nathaniel’s comedy tapes, covering his WASPy upbringing, experiences at an investment bank, and his Cherokee ancestry, with jokes often containing offensive material.  The hosts compared his style to Richard Belzer.  The discussion then shifted to Laszlo, a radio personality whose disastrous first show featured inappropriate jokes and technical difficulties.  Clips from Laszlo's broadcast were played, including a segment describing a blog post about slashing a woman's throat.  The hosts discussed FCC regulations, referencing specific offensive words, and compared terrestrial and satellite radio experiences. The segment concluded with a discussion about a listener’s child using profanity, leading to an "Assignment America" segment requesting audio of children cursing.  The show ended with a brief discussion about upcoming promotions and the mention of the beginning of a recurring segment called the "Pat battle."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Swing your partner to and fro. Look around, no black sambo.  Ah yes, Lucky Strike, the wonderful flavor.  Taste the draw of Lucky Strike as you drop your children off at an all-white school.  No Negroes here. The only place you want charcoal is in your filter.  The charcoal filter of Lucky Strike. Wonderful.  That's also the only place you want tar, baby. 
[00:00:30]  It's in your cigarette. Not walking the streets of your all-white neighborhood.  Lucky Strike. What a wonderful cigarette.  Good for dining, dancing, or lynching.  Light up a Lucky Strike. You could light it off your Zippo lighter, a match, or a burning cross on a Negro's lawn.  Whatever it takes, light up that Lucky Strike.  You know why Lucky Strike cigarettes are so good? Look at them. They're white. 
[00:01:00]  That's right. When have you ever saw a black cigarette? Never, because it couldn't possibly be good.  Lucky Strike with their wonderful white paper.  Smoke Luckies, because we don't like Negroes.  There it is.  What a time. What a time we lived in.  I think we have one more for Lucky Strike.  Lucky again?  I mean, no, let's try a Newport. 
[00:01:30]  Another Newport ad.  These were boring, though, right? We didn't like the first one.  I don't know. It's kind of jazzy.  Scooby-Doo-Wah-Wah.  Smooth and fresh.  This is for a pot.  It's for a pot.  Never harsh, never rough.  The smoothest tasting menthol cigarette.  Newport, King Size, and New Deluxe 100s. 
[00:02:00]  Little tune written for a cigarette ad, 1936.  You think she had to kill the cigarette because it was talking to her?  That's the same.  That voice.  Do you notice that the menthol ads all have a cool, mellow thing?  Like, that was the message that was trying to hang back and have a menthol.  Right.  Right.  But the other cigarettes.  Lucky.  Smoking Lucky.  Let's say hi to John in Jersey. 
[00:02:30]  Of course, Jersey again.  John?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, bitch-ditch?  Hi, John.  I don't appreciate that type of language.  I just want to tell you guys, when Anthony said he was going to stick to German Shepherds,  I almost drove into a ditch.  You guys rock.  This is the part of the program where we allow you to compliment the bitch.  Oh, thank you.  I'm tearing down the third wall for everyone, Anthony.  So we could feel a little better about ourselves.  What's that?  What is that, Eric?  I have no idea. 
[00:03:00]  Eric, what are you doing?  A pack of Marlboros.  You ever heard that theory that the Marlboro box was designed like the KKK thing, the hoods?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  That's been around for years, that theory.  Yeah, there are all kinds of rumors like that.  Yeah, all right, well, I don't think Marlboro is in cahoots with the Klan.  This is the new and improved O.P. and Anthony show, so we don't beat things into the ground.  We'll try not to.  We're going to say cut right there and end the bit.  End the bit.  Bravo to Anthony for coming up with that on the fly.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you for the musical accompaniment in there.  Derek?  The only time you want tar, baby, is in your cigarettes.  That was great.  Richard, Jenny, coming up.  No, I didn't live in those times.  I was saying those were some...  Guy's like, how old are you?  No, I wasn't around during those.  Yeah, that's right, sure.  It's called a bit, silly.  All right.  Oh, God. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, me, Burt Lancaster.  We would go out and smoke.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, it's O.P. and Anthony.  We're on vacation, so we're playing some of this shit for you.  Shit?  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony show.  Did I just fart?  Live on the Today Show, there's some genetic disaster.  Oh, poor kid.  We're changing the lives of some pretty special kids.  Special.  It's a place where we celebrate ability, not disability. 
[00:04:30]  Some fall of therapy.  Others come just for the fun.  Alicia Danoon is in remission now.  She had a brain tumor when she was three.  All right, you know what?  I'm turning off the audio.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't even want to be tempted.  Why?  She's in remission.  That's good.  I don't even want to be tempted.  The cute girl is petting a dolphin down there in Florida.  Got a bad brain tumor.  God bless her.  Let her be.  Look at that little swimsuit on her.  Thanks, Mom, for that nice genetic handoff.  A brain tumor at three. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, here you go.  Can't be hurtful.  Yeah, must have been my smoking, Mom.  What did that three-year-old get a brain tumor from?  From Mom doing dope.  Nice smile.  Here's a softball on your brain stem, kid.  Get headaches until you're 40.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, it is cruel, and there is no God, and I don't want to hear an argument about it.  Yeah, what did this kid do to deserve a softball tumor?  A brain tumor.  Brain tumor.  In her little head.  And now she gets to pet a dolphin.  Swim with a dolphin. 
[00:05:30]  Hits him with that bottlenose right in the tumor.  Hits him with a dolphin.  Hits him with a softball tumor.  Hits him with a softball tumor.  Jesus.  The dolphin, like, goes, can smell the sickness.  Hits him with a dolphin noises they make.  Tries to beach the kid and kill it.  Yeah.  So it doesn't, yeah.  I smell the sickness on you.  We must beach you.  The kid has no clue that she's...  I'd beach you.  There's a ring around me.  Whatever that is.  The Yates Dolphin.  She's not sure if she's petting a dolphin or a goat. 
[00:06:00]  Take it to a petting zoo, for God's sake.  Mommy, why is the goat in water?  It's all right, Puddin' Head.  It's a dolphin.  Puddin' Head.  Oh, is that horrible Puddin' Head.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Very good.  Eh.  Eh. 
[00:06:30]  Children and their families that needed this.  Fifteen years later, Dina's Island Dolphin Care is the largest non-profit program of its kind.  Recently, they moved into a $2 million facility.  Oh, nice.  A museum of sorts.  And take pride in...  Jesus.  Oh, God.  That was a nice picture.  It would be funny if you get a little shirt for the kids.  I went to the dolphin farm, and all I got was this lousy gene pool.  There you go.  I'm going to swim with the dolphin. 
[00:07:00]  Okay, dear.  Be back later.  Pick up later.  Why do dolphins get pegged with these jobs these days?  You think the dolphins sit in there like, oh, Jesus.  Why can't it be that hot stripper blonde that's on vacation with the other ladies from Hooters?  I used to strap mines to my head, and I put them to enemy boats.  Right.  Now I got to play with this special child. 
[00:07:30]  He's drooling on me.  Oh, I remember this.  Isn't this the theme to Flipper?  They call him Flipper, Flipper, swimming with retards.  And the one you see is smarter than me.  Smarter than me.  Not the kids he's swimming with.  Balancing their heads on his nose, because he thinks it's a big, dumb ball. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, Jesus.  This is nice music.  Tricks.  Tries to jump over his big head, but it's too big.  Crashes into the ear and falls back.  Sneaks under and bites the kid's foot for making him look bad. 
[00:08:30]  Dolphin almost dies because the kid's big tongue gets stuck in his blowhole.  I can't breathe, kid.  Dolphin.  Puppy.  Kitten.  Yeah.  That's why the dolphin's jumping out of the water.  He's just saying, get me away from this retard. 
[00:09:00]  Okay.  Terrific.  That's mean.  Yeah, that's really mean.  They're trying to do something nice, and we're mocking it.  I don't mean it.  That's why there's a three-month wait to swim with the dolphins.  Is there really?  You can't get close to the dolphins anymore.  Where?  Here?  That's all the rage down there in Florida.  It is all the rage.  People love swimming with dolphins.  You go to that, you're on vacation, go to the resort there, and you try to sign up for  the dolphin excursion.  Ah, that's booked six months in advance.  I'm not saying it's inconvenient to have that in your family, but I know that there's 
[00:09:30]  some parents trying to start it, but instead of a dolphin, it's a shark.  Oh, my God.  Swim with the shark.  Swim with the...  It's a dolphin, honey.  Pet this, you photograph ruiner.  You guys, we got a quickie.  It's only a minute and 15 seconds.  Saw a friend of mine, Dally Dooley, once.  Thought he was sleeping.  Gave him a nudge, and his tongue was bitten in two. 
[00:10:00]  Still plenty of it for three men, though.  Let's drink to the dumb look on your face.  Here's to swimming with Down Syndrome women.  Shark's in the water.  Retard goes in the water.  I'll retard.  Farewell and a-do to your brain-damaged child.  I'll educate him, but it's going to take $10,000. 
[00:10:30]  So we need a rocking chair once, not the shark the kid.  Uh, boys, you're going to need a bigger hat.  Look out.  There it comes. 
[00:11:00]  I'm Chrissy.  Yes, well, you know we're all going to hell.  Of course.  Instant feedback.  Like people are telling us anything new.  Yeah.  Oh, that's horrific.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Bob Saget.  Yeah, it rhymes with faggot.  I had a fucked up childhood.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This can't be-  Is this a real story?  Yes, I believe it is.  Stop it.  Get the fuck out of here.  Is this real?  This is like one of the oldest comedy bits ever. 
[00:11:30]  Talking about hurricane names and stuff.  Oh.  What are the ups and downs?  But there's an actual politician getting involved?  Is this real?  Well, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Texas, apparently is angry that the names  of hurricanes are too, and I quote, Lily White.  But she's seeking to have a better representation of names reflecting African Americans or other  ethnic groups.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:12:00]  Do you-  The fact that they are just doing completely pointless destruction is the African American  angle.  A sampling of popular names could include Keisha, Jamal, Deshawn, according to the paper.  And the press will be out there, uh, I don't know, it looked it really bad, uh, I'm not  sure.  The wind was hopping and a hollering.  I don't want to be skinned and alive out here. 
[00:12:30]  It's been a bad month for hurricanes.  Oh, this motherfucker's blowing shit all over.  Back to you in the studio, B.  Is this real?  It's turning this shit into a ghetto.  There's nothing better to do?  You know, World Net Daily, brewing swirl of dissent, black hurricane names, uh, and apparently  I guess Rush Limbaugh was ripping this congresswoman's call for these African American, uh, storm monikers.  Too Lily White.  You know, you fucking crackers get over on some shit. 
[00:13:00]  Wasn't Rush Limbaugh busted fucking buying all these prescription fucking drugs and he  still got a motherfucking job?  Well, O.J.'s innocent, quote unquote, and he can't get a mother-  Well, Michael Jackson fucks kids, he's doing fine.  How about R. Kelly, this video of him, you're an idiot on a 14-year-old, he's selling out  the garden.  You've seen that one, right?  Yeah, it was hot.  You can be sure, one reader wrote in a letter, you can be sure that, uh, if there were too  many black names assigned to hurricanes, this congresswoman would be instead complaining 
[00:13:30]  that this practice unfairly stereotypes blacks as violent.  Well, some motherfuckers could be violent as hurricanes.  Another, Greg Cook, his name is, not a coincidence, says, this is ridiculous, how about, uh, naming  the storms after gang members or infamous criminals?  How about not having any names at all associated with hurricanes?  Yeah, so, uh, people are saying this is ridiculous, and it is ridiculous.  What does she want, representation in the hurricane naming community? 
[00:14:00]  Stop.  That's good, again, that she's not worried about terrorism or Islam, she's worried about  hurricanes.  How about the fact that, um, maybe you should be looking at the fact that Jamal is killing  Deshawn on the streets.  You know what I mean?  And, uh, Keisha was an innocent bystander being killed by, uh, uh, bullets fired by Deshawn.  While being pregnant with her 15th kid.  Right, Keisha, Keisha just threw her baby in the fucking garbage can, because she didn't  want to support her. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, maybe that's an issue you should really be, uh, delving into.  That's right, better trash pickup.  Yo, where's the fucking bell, dude?  This Democrat, this is satellite, we don't need to do the bell as much.  All right.  Fuck the bell.  Fuck the bell, yo.  Democrat Sheila Jackson wants Black Hurricane names, Hillary Clinton's going after video  games, Chuck Schumer wants Cousin Brucie to keep his job.  I gotta say that, uh, not that the Republicans are all right, they're not, but the Democrats,  can you please pick battles that we give a shit about? 
[00:15:00]  Please.  And meanwhile, they just showed a picture of, uh, a suspected bomber that left a bomb on  the bus in London.  They had a clear picture of him walking off of the bus, and, uh, we're not profiling,  uh, as we're searching bags in the subway stations.  Yet, this guy sure didn't look Asian to me.  Oh.  Didn't look black.  Nope.  Uh, certainly wasn't a white guy.  Nope.  He was a young, Middle Eastern man.  Or a man of Middle Eastern descent.  Yeah.  He's a pecky.  We got audio of this, uh, pecky. 
[00:15:30]  Isn't that a motherfucker right there?  We got audio of the Congresswoman.  And he's wearing a New York shirt.  We're wearing a New York shirt.  Great.  That's ironic.  We got audio of the Congresswoman.  Oh, we do?  Yeah, the dumb, working crowd.  I'd like to hear it.  Well, be sure and get pet battle.  My condolences.  I'm a beaten man.  You're a tie.  I'm a beaten man.  Ah, there's another one.  That's the motherfucker that served me my falafel on fucking 6 and 23 yesterday.  He looks like Louis T. 
[00:16:00]  On.  We already know with the handlebar mustache.  There's another young, uh, law-abiding gentleman.  Well, at least they're handling the big issues.  Hurricanes and video games.  And, uh, Cousin Brucey.  It's all politicians that do this, by the way.  Agreed.  I'm just saying lately.  I mean, it's all politicians that are just, uh, publicity whores.  They look for these dumb things that the press will pick up on and run with, and then  they get their name out there.  You're right, but it just seems like lately the Democrats have been taking these, these  non-issues, and they're not doing anything that I particularly care about, which is crime 
[00:16:30]  and terrorism.  Yeah.  Those are the main things, and I don't see them doing anything that's making me go, hey, man,  I'm really glad you're at least doing that.  Although, how scary would Hurricane Pat Battle be?  Wheeling up the coast.  Wreaking havoc.  A dark hurricane with a big, awful blonde wig on it.  Well, that's why they don't got black names, because hurricanes is white.  You ever see them from the satellite and shit?  They're fucking massive white clouds.  Very good, old dirty.  Meteorologist O.D.  So, therefore, the name should reflect the color of the hurricane. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  That's right.  I was just talking to...  Pet battle.  Pet battle.  They would name them Asian, but then again, they wouldn't know if they were hurricanes or  calm days, tsunamis.  Yeah, the eye looks kind of slanted, right?  Then you give it an Asian name.  The eye of the hurricane is two feet wide and three miles long.  Slanted.  Listen, what are the recent hurricane names? 
[00:17:30]  Emily.  If they're so lily white.  Was it Emily, one of them?  No.  What are we up to?  Maybe CD.  Danny.  Oh, you got them?  What are they?  What are they?  Oh, some of the ones we've had so far.  All right.  In 2005, we started with Arlene.  Arlene is a very white name, sure.  And it used to be all female names, and then they had to be politically correct, and then  they had the guy names.  I kind of like just having the female names.  Of course.  That's right.  Arlene, which is an old lady's name.  Yeah.  Brett.  Brett?  My brother's name.  That's a white name.  That's a crack-ass, crack-ass name.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Cindy.  Well, okay.  Cindy's a whitey name.  Dennis.  Dennis.  Hurricane Dennis.  Emily.  Came in with a sweater tied around its shoulders.  Do you really want Hurricane Rufus?  Rufus?  They didn't say black names from the 30s.  How about that?  Hurricane Stampin' Fitchett.  How about that?  Hurricane Kunta blowing through the Carolinas.  How do you like that?  Silly.  Franklin.  All right.  Franklin's a black name.  It sure is, right?  Here's one that'll get a chuckle. 
[00:18:30]  Another old lady's name.  Gert.  Gert.  Hurricane Gert.  Gertie's blowing.  Like she did when the Kaiser was in charge.  It's like a giant diaper spinning.  Just shit and piss and forgotten memories flung all over the state.  My God.  It's unrecognizable family members are being thrown all over the yard.  Hurricane Gertie's track.  Who's going to leave their home when they know Hurricane Gert is on the way?  Jesus.  It has no idea where it's been or where it's going. 
[00:19:00]  Hurricane Gert can't get anybody to acknowledge it or talk to it.  It's a burden of a hurricane.  Hurricane Gert's complaining its family never visits.  According to Hurricane Gert, it's chilly again.  Awful name.  Hurricane Harvey.  Harvey?  Hurricane Harvey?  Gee, I never knew the tsunami was so fat.  I got a Hurricane Shirley bigger than you. 
[00:19:30]  Hurricane Irene.  Irene?  Hurricane Jose.  There you go.  There you go.  A little representation.  A little Hurricane Irene from a movie Good Night, Irene.  Hurricane Jose does no damage, but hubcaps are blown off.  Hurricane Katrina.  Katrina.  Hurricane Lee.  Hurricane Maria.  Hurricane Nate.  That's a black Nate.  I would call it Hurricane Than, though.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Hurricane Ophelia.  Ophelia?  That's going to be the worst one.  Hurricane Felipe.  All right, that's an ethnic name.  And then it goes with Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince, and Wilma.  Wilma?  Awful.  But they never get to the W1, do they?  Nah, that's pretty rough to get down.  That's a hell of a hurricane season they get down there.  And then what do they got to start over, right?  Yeah, then they go to 06.  They got mapped them out.  They got names for the next.  Who does this shit? 
[00:20:30]  But if they get down to the last one and they run out of names, don't they got to go back  to A again?  Yeah.  Or do they dip into 2006?  They might have to dip.  I have no idea.  I'm going to have to research.  Might have to go with that dip thing.  You're in deep shit, though.  If you have Hurricane Yolanda and then Hurricane Zeppelin, you've had a shitty hurricane season.  When you call this effing show, there are four words that you must know.  Learn to punch out.  I'm punching out.  I'm punching out.  Punch down.  Punch down.  You guys are great.

The Technophile.  Hi, I'm Laszlo.  Technology fads are inescapable.  One minute, all you hear about is internet radio, then it's podcasting, followed up by  online poker.  The poker craze has inspired several poker nerds to write software that tells them the  best way to bet.  Counting cards in a real casino will get you tossed out. 
[00:22:00]  But poker bots are being used to prey on newcomers, help with strategy, and in the end, make money.  It's bad enough that the 25-year-old blonde that you're chatting with is probably a fat guy  just out of prison.  Now you could be playing poker against a computer and not even know it.  Some say that poker players are being paranoid, and the software needed for the intricate process  of reading other cards, bluffing, and folding is years away.  But in the end, if you're up at midnight betting away your paycheck, whether you're playing 
[00:22:30]  against man or machine, it's called gambling for a reason.  I'm L-A-Z-L-O-W dot com.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  High Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by contacting XM Listener Care at 1-800-XM-RADIO.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, this is Howie Mandel.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Remember the 1950s sex ed audio tapes we did?  Who could forget that?  Those were a lot of fun. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, we found the audio tapes on the internet.  We brought them in, and it killed an hour.  What the hell?  This is how it sounded that day.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Anthony, you brought in the parents to child.  Parents talk to child about sex thing?  Yeah, that's one of the many educational films I was going through.  You know how you're cruising around on the internet, and you're just kind of, you don't know how you end up at some place, but you're there?  It's kind of one of those situations. 
[00:23:30]  I'm going around, and I ended up on this film archive site.  They had everything.  You know, you want to see presidential speeches from the past and stuff from NASA and all just American history, world history, actually.  And one of these archives was educational and industrial films.  There's just a slew of them.  So I'm checking them all out, and they had ones on perversion.  And there were whole films on how girly magazines and men's fitness magazines cater to the homosexuals. 
[00:24:00]  Don't let your child read these.  He can turn into a homosexual.  Very angry at the homosexuals.  And one of them was called Boys Beware.  We got to pull clips from that one.  It's a whole thing on how boys have to beware of homosexuals that drive around in cars trying to pick them up at the basketball court in the high school.  And they have these scenarios that play out, and it's so funny.  Guy comes over, and he offers a boy a ride home, and the boy takes it, and he gives him a gentle pat on the shoulder. 
[00:24:30]  And then, like, next weekend, he was back at the school driving Billy home.  He decided to ask him if he wanted to go fishing.  They went fishing the next weekend.  This is where he showed Billy some pornographic photography.  And he shows him pictures.  And before you know it, they were walking up into a hotel room together. 
[00:25:00]  And he put his arm around Billy.  What was the excuse that the homosexual used?  If things like this happen, be sure to tell your parents before it's too late.  And you're led to believe that the kid takes it right up the keister in the hotel by the homo.  But how did he get him up into the hotel room?  He just talked him into it.  And he talked him into it.  And then the next scene is Billy and his parents, with Billy with his head down, walking out of the police station.  Not being able to sit down. 
[00:25:30]  Billy finally told his parents, yeah, and you just know he was ravaged.  What kind of good pedophile takes a kid out four times before he bangs him?  Oh, I know.  He was, like, dating this kid.  What ever happened to a shallow grave after the first date?  Oh, God.  That was another one, which I guess ended pretty quickly.  A kid on a basketball court, and his friends left, and the kid wanted to play.  You know, Johnny wanted to play a little longer.  And this guy comes out and offers to play a game with him.  And it's just this big, oafish, old guy with the horseshoe bald head and the glasses. 
[00:26:00]  And he's playing basketball with the kid, and he offers him a ride home.  And he goes, little did he know, he traded a little more time at the basketball court for his life.  His life?  His life.  That's it.  This guy was thorough.  No dating and fishing for him.  Yeah, this guy wasn't about waiting a month to see what the little boy had.  It's a hollow, hollow, shovel over the head.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, those clips are coming.  And there was no distinction in this between homosexuality and predator pedophile murder. 
[00:26:30]  It was just, they were all grouped together.  The homosexual will prey on children.  So we got parents.  This is a little different.  This is parents being educated by these doctors on sex, how to tell their kids about sex.  And a lot of it is played out in scenario and conversation.  All right.  The first clip is, Mommy talks about vagina.  Yes, she does.  Mommy, I want to ask you something. 
[00:27:00]  What is it, dear?  I know that the baby goes inside you.  That's where Johnny was.  But he seems so big.  What I wonder is, how does he get out of there?  Your belly button?  It's too small.  Mary, the baby doesn't come out of your navel.  Let me tell you how it is.  Oh, boy.  There's a special opening just in front of the place where you have your BM. 
[00:27:30]  What?  It's very, very tiny and a little girl.  It's a special opening right in front of the hole that you have your BM.  Your Big Moody from My Bodyguard?  How funny is that?  And you'll notice later in life that because you have that, it's the only reason men talk to you.  It is a special hole, isn't it?  Yeah.  Because it's a special hole.  Just in front of the place where you have your BM. 
[00:28:00]  It's very, very tiny and a little girl, but as you grow, it grows, too, right along with the rest of you.  Slut.  Until when you're grown up, it gets to be just about this size.  Now, when the baby's ready to be born, it stretches up to be about this size.  Holding her hands three feet apart.  Just big enough for the baby to slip through, head first.  Then, after the baby's born, it goes back to its regular size.  No, it doesn't.  Do you remember how big my tummy stretched when the baby was growing in there?  Only if you have a good doctor.  And now, see, I'm flat again. 
[00:28:30]  I'm back to my regular size.  Do you understand?  Why does Daddy beat you?  But if I forget it, you can always tell me again.  Maybe when Tabby has her kittens, you can see how they come.  I like that, but there's something else.  How did the baby get started in this?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Daddy comes home drunk from the office, smelling of whiskey, and flips Mommy over. 
[00:29:00]  Remember that special hole I was talking about?  Daddy doesn't treat it that special.  He makes it a B.M., a bloody mess.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  The special opening that little girls have, the one I told you about, has a name, the vagina. 
[00:29:30]  Now, you know that little boys, like our Johnny, have a penis.  You see his penis when we change his diapers.  Yes.  When a boy grows up and is ready to be a father, he is able to put his penis into the vagina.  Right.  That special opening that mothers have.  And when he does this, he can plant the seed that starts a baby to grow.  Isn't this little girl a little too young to know this much?  It's very wrong. 
[00:30:00]  It is very wrong when you watch it.  The kid's much too young.  Shut up.  Go outside and play.  His mother's leaving out the whole foreplay thing.  All the good stuff.  Always hold the bag, honey.  You know?  His mother stinks.  It's an awful lay.  Put it in.  You just know she lays there.  Now put it in my special hole, dear.  Plant your seed.  Oh, God.  I'm going back to my secretary.  You stink.  All right. 
[00:30:30]  The next clip is about masturbation.  Yes.  Let me at this point make a clear-cut scientific statement.  Masturbation is not harmful.  The young child often plays with his genitals.  And after puberty, masturbation is a common release mechanism for the sex drive.  Growing boys will either masturbate to get rid of this energy or have a nocturnal emission,  the so-called wet dream.  Since sexual fantasies or dreams often accompany these experiences, the teenager will sometimes feel guilty or ashamed. 
[00:31:00]  What he needs right then is reassurance from his parents that they know these things happen  and that the experience itself is not harmful to health or to normal growing up.  Not important at all.  It should be viewed as just a passing phase.  That lasts a lifetime.  You add to guilt by terrifying the teenager with fables and myths  or by giving the impression that the genital areas are evil or taboo.  These misstatements and misconceptions are the real danger. 
[00:31:30]  Writing a song parody?  Taboo.  You doing a radio show with Anthony?  You doing a radio show with Anthony?  Tell him it's okay to put it wherever he wants it.  That's creepy, man.  Yeah.  Thank God he wasn't teaching me that crap.  No.  Who's listening to that guy about masturbation?  Funky Treasure says,  Sometimes Daddy puts it where Mommy has her BM.  Oh, that's great. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, these films are really funny.  What is BM, by the way?  A bowel movement.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  That's an olden days term for going to the bathroom or taking a dump.  BM.  A BM.  Or making poo-poo or poopies, as they tell the kids these days.  Toolbag Johnson from New Orleans writes,  Doesn't BM stand for bend movement?  Old gravy leg.  Dear, it's this special hole right in front of the place that makes you have gravy legs.  You're going to need club soda when Ricky comes back, because we're running out of things to do. 
[00:32:30]  Getting a little short.  Good.  All right.  So the next clip is the doctor talking about wet dreams, I guess.  Is this...  We really want the homosexual audio.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get to that.  That's on the way.  This is great stuff, though.  I love this stuff.  Well, Jimmy Norton, what you have to do is calm down. 
[00:33:00]  You're a sex addict.  Oh, gee.  Like I committed a crime, Beave.  I know.  It sounds like leave it to Beaver.  You know, Wally, I was playing with myself last night, and I felt like a creep. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, don't worry about it, Beave.  Mom has to wash my sheets every hour on the hour.  I'm jerking it all the time.  Well, me and Lumpy went out behind in the house in the woods,  and he was all lumpy in his pants.  And I won't even tell you what happened to Whitey.  It was all Whitey in my face.  It sounds like...  Because it is from the same time. 
[00:34:00]  It's another 50s.  So they get these whiny little kids.  Oh, and I didn't know what I'm doing.  Just grab it, crank it, and go out.  Have fun.  Next thing you know, I'm feeding a hooker a bran muffin,  laying underneath her yelling,  Bombs away.  I felt like a creep or something.  It's okay to take logs on your chest.  Don't be embarrassed.  All right.  I don't think I can do this. 
[00:34:30]  Hold on.  Oh, man.  Cool.  Beaver!  Beaver!  Gee, I hope Dad doesn't come up here  and catch me spanking the monkey, Wally.  Oh, it's okay.  Dad does it all the time.  Mom doesn't like getting it in her special hole  in front of the place she has her BM.  So, is this how you do it, Wally? 
[00:35:00]  Sure, Beef.  Just grab on and crank away.  Everything will be fine.  But what if I make a mess?  That's what Mom's for, Beef.  To clean up our mess.  Sure, Beef.  The men in the house make messes everywhere.  Whether it's in that special hole  or on the sheets like you boys.  Mom will clean it up.  Because that's her job.  It's the 50s.  She's there to clean up our sexual fluids  and to take my punches in the face 
[00:35:30]  when I'm pissed off from a day at the office.  Now, crank away, kids,  and don't worry about the laundry.  That's Mom's job.  She also cooks a mean pot roast.  Ah.  Isn't it nice to have someone  to clean up your fluids  and make a nice roast at the end of it all?  It's the 50s.  And it's wonderful.  The 50s just seemed so great.  Everyone was stupid. 
[00:36:00]  If you missed the 50s, move to Toronto.  They're still living it.  Are they?  Oh, my God.  Hey, I want to talk about masturbation, eh?  I'll put a boot in your dog's liver.  What's this swimming naked clip?  Oh, well, they're just discussing things, Opie.  The adolescent boy has other problems, too.  I'm talking about his problems in growth and development,  which can be as disturbing to him as his sex pressures. 
[00:36:30]  Boy, how do I always get the top locker?  Two boys in the locker room.  The junior team you're on looked pretty good today.  You guys better watch out.  You might make the finals.  Yeah, but we'd be a lot better if I were bigger.  I'm sure getting tired waiting to grow up.  It's no fun being such a scrawny kid.  It may sound funny to you, but...  Boy, when I change my pants,  I like to crawl in that locker I feel so undeveloped. 
[00:37:00]  That's not so funny.  Before we moved here,  I used to go to a school where we had to go swimming in the bear.  I was so embarrassed about the size of my penis  that we used to dread the days we had to go swimming.  Even though it was my best sport,  I was good at it, too, like you.  Boy, what I wouldn't have given for a fig leaf.  For a big shawl.  Well, how do you think I feel?  He's got a little dick.  That is so funny.  What school is he going to where they swim naked?  Dude, we did this...  We talked about stuff like this in the past, 
[00:37:30]  and a bunch of people came out of the woodwork  saying that they were forced to swim naked in high school.  Unbelievable that that was actually going on.  They would swim naked?  Could you imagine?  Gee, Dad, I feel a little embarrassed going swimming.  I feel like a creep or something.  I get in the pool, and I got a little schlong.  That's okay, Beaver.  I had a little schlong when I used to go swimming,  but look how big and thick and fat it's gotten. 
[00:38:00]  Whoa, Dad, put that away.  That's what your mom says right before I put it where she has her BM.  And then she just says,  ouch, ooch.  And she has to wash the sheets again.  That's her job, you know.  You know, Dad, sometimes when you go to work,  Eddie Haskell comes over,  and Mom makes the same sounds in her bedroom  that she makes when you're in there.  Well, really? 
[00:38:30]  How about that, Beaver?  Eddie Haskell's becoming quite a man.  You know, someday those girls at school  are going to want you to put it in the special hall,  and that's when you flip them over  and put it in their balloon knot.  What's a balloon knot, Dad?  Well, blow up a balloon, tie it in a knot,  and look into where you just blew.  What does that look like?  Oh, I get it, Dad. 
[00:39:00]  The place where the BM comes from.  Sure.  Sure it is.  God, the 50s rocked.  I wish I was there.  Do anything you want.  Here you go, dude.  Everything was in black and white.  Hold on, hold on.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  We used to swim naked in school.  Told you.  Naked in school.  All right, so you're what?  You're 60 years old?  36.  36.  I'm 36. 
[00:39:30]  Where were you swimming naked?  We were in Cheektawaga outside of Buffalo, New York.  That makes sense now.  And what would they say?  What was the first day you had to do this?  What was that like?  Um, it was like, uh, what the fuck?  I gotta get naked and swim with fucking 30 guys?  And the teacher just said, take your clothes off?  Yeah.  They did not give us bathing suits, and we weren't allowed to wear bathing suits because  they said that the soap clogged the filters or something like that. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, I know a lot of guys who all had to do with the same thing, and I mean, it  was, it was fucking weird.  And, uh, once I got in high school and stuff, I was like, I ain't doing this anymore.  I mean, what the fuck?  You play chicken with fucking a naked sack on your neck?  You know?  Fuck that.  Jesus.  All right.  Well, there you go.  I told you, Ant.  I didn't know that was going on.  The logic of it is crazy, but, uh.  This day and age.  Mike in Jersey. 
[00:40:30]  What's up, Mike?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, uh, you really pulled a boner this time, B.  Wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, some words take on different meanings.  Hey, we had naked Greco-Roman wrestling when I was in school.  Don't be such a baby.  Stop it.  They did not.  I'm just joking.  Yeah.  Take care, guys.  You never know, though.  They did in the older days do that.  Not, like, really older, but in school they would have the kids wrestle naked.  Come on.  Ugh.  No way.  I read that.  Mac, what's up? 
[00:41:00]  In one of those homosexual magazines.  Opie, Opie, kill the vet, man.  They're new sponsors.  Huh?  Oh, yeah.  Kill the vet.  It's a new sponsor.  Probably.  Very funny.  Yeah, very good.  All right, uh, one hit.  So we're back to this?  Yeah.  If you're just tuning in, we're playing, uh, intern runaround today.  I think he's up to five or, I don't even know anymore.  This is, I think, his sixth trip.  You don't have to act.  Out into the tundra.  Eric's all mad.  I'm like, you don't have to act.  He's gone.  What's the matter?  It was supposed to be a salted bagel with cream cheese. 
[00:41:30]  It's plain with nothing.  Uh-oh.  It's a cream cheese bagel with salt.  All right, Anthony, the next clip is about menstruation.  Ah, menstruation.  There's been a real change in our approach to education about menstruation.  It's hard to believe what grandmother experienced, but let's hear her story.  Here's grandma talking about it.  I'll never forget when I was 14 years old.  I went to the little outhouse on our farm.  Outhouse.  My new dress was stained, and there was blood on my underclothes.  Uh-huh. 
[00:42:00]  Hey, really, granny.  Sounds hot.  Did grandpa put it where you BM?  Maybe it was read from slaughtering an American Indian, you rotten old bag.  We had just returned from a lynching when I noticed I was bleeding.  The front of my underpants looked like I was attacked with a bingo splatter. 
[00:42:30]  Old copper panties.  Blood on my underclothes.  I ran inside and showed my mother, and all she said was,  You're menstruating, and turned and walked away.  I had to find out how to take care of myself from my cousin.  Were any of your girlfriends told in advance by their mothers? 
[00:43:00]  No, I'm afraid not.  They were just as scared as I was.  Yeah, Laura Ingalls, all of them.  And some of them had later sisters who told them.  One thing I was sure of, I would never let this happen to my daughter.  Why do you suppose your mother didn't tell you in advance?  Ignorance.  Just plain stupid ignorance.  Well, calm down, granny.  She's got some mother issues.  No kidding.  I remember.  And then this young Union soldier came by my house, and he had fired a shot. 
[00:43:30]  It went through his testicles.  It hit me in the ovary, and I was pregnant.  You can read about me on urbanlegends.com.  What's .com?  I have no clue.  It's the 50s.  Oh, my big bloomers just stained.  Oh, that just sounds awful.  Disgusting.  That's funny, though.  I was dirty.  Well, here we go.  A little discussion about sanitary napkins.  Ah, here you go. 
[00:44:00]  Mommy, what's this?  Well, I guess, honey, you're old enough now to understand these things.  She's one.  Those are sanitary pads for me, honey.  Yeah, really.  Ah, Mommy, what's this?  Well, here you go.  He takes his big schlong.  Oh.  Ah, let's start over.  Okay.  Come on.  Mommy, what's this?  Well, I guess, honey, you're old enough now to understand these things. 
[00:44:30]  Those are sanitary pads for me, honey.  You know that mothers have a special place inside them where the babies grow before they come out?  Well, each month in a grown-up woman, a sort of soft, nesty place builds up.  Soft, nesty place or nasty place?  Nesty?  A soft, nesty place.  That's how she's describing her womb.  It's the 50s, though.  She should be describing the outside of it as nesty. 
[00:45:00]  Nesty and nesty.  Looks like a vulture's nest out there.  You just know it's big and awful.  No hygiene going on down there.  A grown-up woman, a sort of soft, nesty place builds up.  And some of the nest is blood.  And if a woman is going to have a baby, she needs this nest for the baby to grow in.  Unless daddy kicks her in it.  If no baby has started there, then the blood in the nest isn't needed. 
[00:45:30]  And it just dribbles out of the vagina for a few days.  Dribbles.  Sometimes mommy sneezes and stains the linoleum.  That's awful.  Do they explain crime scene sex?  Dribbles.  No.  No.  No.  And then a fresh new nest place starts building up.  That's what the pads are for, to catch the blood. 
[00:46:00]  Does it hurt?  It shouldn't.  It's something that happens to every girl when she grows up.  Now have a lucky.  You're old enough.  Light up a lucky.  Puff away, dear.  What are you now, two?  Here you go.  It's lucky children's cigarettes.  Smoke for your health.  Now included with your dolly, a pack of Lucky Stripes. 
[00:46:30]  Soft, nasty, nasty.  A lot of great instant feedback coming in, by the way.  Big dog from Texas.  Ben didn't want to swim naked because his dong would drag along the bottom.  Unfortunately, I can't do impressions,  but funky treasure from CringeHumor.net.  Did you read this one?  I'm not sure.  He writes this a lot every morning.  Wally, I saw mom make a BM on dad's chest last night. 
[00:47:00]  Gee, Wally.  And then J-Mac from...  I don't want you to get scared by what you saw last night, Wally.  Dad, it was kind of creepy.  Gee, Dad, I saw mom squatting over you, and she was having a BM on your chest.  Now, Wally, although on the outside this might look odd,  it's quite pleasurable when mom drops logs on my chest. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, sure, we've done that ever since college.  It might stink a little, and, well, I don't tell the boys down at the office about it,  but it's perfectly normal.  Maybe when you're out on a date, you could have a girl drop logs on your chest  or face if you're a real trooper.  You know, it started years ago when I used to play Monster Rain  with some of the boys in my neighborhood.  Monster Rain, Dad?  Sure, Wally. 
[00:48:00]  That's when you yell, Monster Rain's coming, and run under the porch,  and all of a sudden we fillet each other.  Ain't the 50s great?  Gee, I'm going to go play that with Eddie Haskell, Dad.  Sure, you go run off and play.  Monster Rain.  And grab a couple of Luckies on your way out and puff away.  I love a Lucky Strike. 
[00:48:30]  And striking your mom.  It's the 50s, you know.  So did we play the Sanitary Napkins one, sort of?  Yeah, right?  Yeah, yeah, we got through that one.  And then J-Mac from Philly writes,  why does Ann have to tell everyone he isn't taking part in the gag?  Why does he have to separate himself from the group all the time?  I'm offended by it.  All right.  Ann talks about her period?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  All right, let's get this one over here.  A little period talk.  Come on.  Ann, when did you first learn about menstrual periods?  Oh, I really can't remember.  I just always sort of seem to know something about it,  and I knew that I'd have them someday.  I do remember, though.  I knew that I'd have them.  Like, I don't know where this accent is from, but it's horrible.  Nothing sexy about this.  I knew I'd have them.  Yeah, yeah.  When I started to develop, my mother reminded me that I'd probably be starting soon, 
[00:49:30]  and that's when she went into the sort of information that you gave in the animation.  Not as clearly as that, but I felt I knew what the score was.  And then she did a very practical thing.  She gave me a belt and a pad, and I was all set.  A belt and a pad.  All of my friends' mothers didn't do it this well, though.  Among my friends, it really ran the gamut about what they knew and what they didn't know.  A belt and a pad.  Ah, the good old days.  You had to buckle up like a fighter pilot when you have your period. 
[00:50:00]  With a Gucci belt buckle.  We ought to give pads and belts for them.  For Noah.  Have them wear that around the office.  A belt and a pad.  A pad and a belt.  Nice.  Any ithers?  One more?  No one ever mentions that you can wear two pads on a heavy day or that tampons are all right, even if you aren't married.  What is that about?  Well, you didn't want to put anything in there if you're not married.  Because then if you have a husband who's checking you out, you know, some husbands would actually check out the woman and make sure she's intact. 
[00:50:30]  And women were afraid that a tampon would break that and make her look like a slut to a husband who's searching for a virgin.  All right.  No one ever mentions that you can wear two pads on a heavy day or that tampons are all right, even if you aren't married.  The fact is, a lot of girls do get cramps in the first couple of days.  I know then I'm limited for some sports.  You mean that what you really needed to know is that menstruation is a nuisance, but not something terribly unpleasant. 
[00:51:00]  The guys.  Oh, I don't know.  But after a few periods, a girl becomes very aware of some of these nuisance factors.  Really, they're just inconveniences for the most part.  Of course, it's nothing like my mother's day, not nearly so restricted.  You should hear my mother laugh about her high school gym class.  Yeah.  All the ladies who are having their periods had to get in their gym suits.  Then they sit along the sidelines, radiating their attainment of womanhood and smugly enjoying their femeneness while the rest of them whack the volleyball. 
[00:51:30]  Whack the volleyball.  Ugh.  What an accent.  Pids.  Hi, weird Pids.  That is weird.  That is weird stuff.  They're all whacking a volleyball, and mom and other friends are just there bleeding against the wall.  Bleeding against the wall.  That is disgusting. 
[00:52:00]  Big, thick, double pads on there.  Dribbling out.  Looks like Dracula with Down syndrome.  Curiacula.  Sometimes I'd have to wear two pads.  Oh.  Oh.  It was pretty disgusting when I had to put on two pads.  Just like I was wearing a diaper.  You know, a bloody diaper.  You should tell your children about this so they're not embarrassed. 
[00:52:30]  What an awful accent that was.  Sometimes I wish I'd be sexually active, but not with this accent.  God damn it.  I'm banging Sipowitz over here.  Hey, come on.  Put it in my ass.  Come on, you lousy skill.  That's horrible. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, how cute.  There's Katie doing some sledding this morning on the Today Show.  Hit a tree.  Leaving a red stripe down the mountain.  I'm having my period.  That's great.  That was all they had back then.  Education.  You don't see those anymore.  Do they still even play stuff like that in school?  They have to update it.  You know, we're so PC now that everything's got to be just right.  So I think they would just opt not to make these anymore.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're damn interesting to watch. 
[00:53:30]  I was watching some.  I didn't bring in any, but on wartime propaganda and some of the films back then, they had this  film that was about the Japanese during World War II, and it was supposed to be a Japanese  guy talking.  It was an American guy dressed up in makeup like a Jap, and he's like, let me tell you  about my Japan.  Japan, we are working the war effort to beat you, American.  And it was just the most racist, hate-filled thing I've ever seen. 
[00:54:00]  It was great.  Where's our propaganda music that we were playing last week?  All right.  We'll get it.  You know some of these things are directly responsible for the A-bomb being dropped, because  they went into like, you know, so send your people over.  We will fight to the last man.  There are millions of us here in Tokyo and all over Japan that will fight.  We will never stop.  Send your waves of soldiers over.  We will beat them.  We will kill all of you.  And it's got to be like, geez, this guy sounds serious. 
[00:54:30]  Why don't we just drop a huge bomb from the sky and kill them all?  You know?  And as you land back on the safe runway of your base, you can light up a Lucky Strike cigarette.  Yes, when that match lights and the end of your Lucky glows, think of the glowing Japs  in Hiroshima, writhing in pain and radiation as you draw that fresh, clean tobacco taste of  your Lucky Strike.  And know when you go back home, the Japs will be sitting in internment camps, never 
[00:55:00]  to annoy you with their funny faces.  Light up a Lucky Strike and celebrate America's victory over the animal Japanese.  They aren't really human, you know.  When you burn them out of their caves with your flamethrowers, use that last spark to light  a Lucky.  Lucky, yes, American troops, smoking Lucky, being Lucky, Lucky Strike, every Lucky you 
[00:55:30]  smoke stands for a dead Jap, Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Hmm.  I ain't got nothing on.  That's right.  That was funny.  My tank ran dry.  Sweetie, look, I filled the ball.  You got to respect that.  It's disgusting.  Log on to XM's 100% commercial-free music channels with XM Online.

[00:56:30]  I'm Ernie Sprantz.  Automobiles are becoming increasingly loaded with high-tech gadgetry, a trend probably most  evident among luxury cars.  For the September issue, Consumer Reports tested five models with varying degrees of techno  wizardry.  The Infiniti M35, Audi A6, Cadillac STS, Acura RL, and Lexus GS300.  Each come with standard features like side curtain head protection airbags, electronic  stability control, and strong V6 engines mated to 5- and 6-speed automatic transmissions. 
[00:57:00]  Trimmed in leather and wood, each offers a variety of features that can include navigation  systems, voice recognition, and heated steering wheels.  As equipped, they each price out at roughly $50,000.  Luxury sedans like these should be well-rounded when compared with those priced around $30,000  and should deliver superior performance, comfort, agility, and accommodations.  The Infiniti M35 accomplishes this handily.  The Acura RL doesn't, having been outscored by its cheaper sibling, the $34,000 TL. 
[00:57:30]  To our surprise, the M35 is now top-rated, besting even the high-scoring BMW 530i and Mercedes-Benz  E320.  The Infiniti's reliability should be very good, so it can be recommended, unlike the Beamer  and the Benz, which can't because of subpar reliability.  I'm Ernie Sprantz for Consumer Reports, online at consumerreports.org.  Oh, hello. 
[00:58:00]  This is Miss Swan, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All of it is so bad, it's hard to tell which is the worst.  Hey, where's Dee Dee been lately, man?  Uh, doesn't want to be on the show anymore?  No.  No?  No, she wants to be on the show.  Sure.  We've just been too lazy.  Satin.  We've been too lazy to call her, I think.  Satin.  I think she's just sitting there in Washington.  It's made of Satin.  Satin.  She's sitting there in Washington every day just hoping that that phone will ring for  she to be on our show again.  Terrible accent.  We love Dee Dee, and she has a horrendous accent. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  And I guess we comment, uh, I guess we, uh, talk about it here.  Yes, we do.  Cool.  It's the worst.  Dee, you really need to drink more.  Mm-hmm.  All right, Dee Dee, you want to do some more news?  Sure.  Maybe real news this time?  Hey, I had, like, a Rob Lowe story, and I did good before, right?  You tricked us with a Rob Lowe.  I know.  Well, you know.  All right, how about Stanton Island Animal Shelter? 
[00:59:00]  What?  Animal Shelter?  It's about an animal shelter in Stanton Island.  Wait, what the hell is that?  What?  Nothing.  Sorry.  I don't know.  What the?  Somebody hit a button.  Okay, there you go.  I'm going to start on.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Dee Dee.  Okay, Stanton Island, an animal shelter begins killing kittens.  What?  Okay, we see.  What?  All right.  Hold on, I was just laughing, because they're making faces in the other room.  I'm sorry.  All right.  Okay, can you start again?  You asses.  Stop with that. 
[00:59:30]  Okay, go ahead, Dee.  I'm sorry, Dee Dee.  Go ahead.  Yeah, just start over.  We're all looking in here.  I know.  It's Dee Dee with the news, everybody.  Go ahead, Dee Dee.  The last few months, a Stanton Island animal shelter has been trying to find homes for all  the kittens that come in there.  Why are you laughing?  No reason.  You make Steve sound like Voss.  Well, Steve is jumping up and down making goofy faces.  I'm sorry.  He's trying to distract the show, so nothing.  I didn't hear.  First of all, they're all laughing.  I didn't hear where this took place or what was happening. 
[01:00:00]  All right, I'm sorry.  What's the story?  It's in Brooklyn.  Something about animals.  Where was it?  Steve, stop, okay?  I was told to stay at Stanton Island.  Okay.  All right.  And you're right.  You have the news story.  I don't.  All right.  I didn't even hear that because I was telling Steve to stop.  All right.  So why don't we start again here?  Why don't we make believe nothing happened yet?  Okay, here we go.  Dee, you're with the news.  Okay.  All right.  Stanton Island.  Animal shelter.  Why is that so funny?  Good.  What's in there?  Nothing.  I know.  Anyway, there's animal shelter that's killing kittens. 
[01:00:30]  Because I live on Long Island.  All right.  Is that where that was?  No, it's not Long Island.  It's not Long Island, dude.  Where was it?  I'm not going to say.  Anyway, the last few months, this animal shelter has been trying to find homes for all the kittens  that come in there.  It's not funny.  And because they can't find homes, many cute kittens are going to be turned into General  Sells chickens.  Why are you laughing?  And why are they going to be turned into General Sells?  Because they're at full capacity, so they have to do it. 
[01:01:00]  So come on, people.  Go get a kitten.  Don't let them die.  A kitten?  A kitten?  I can't even...  Listen...  They're going to kill them!  Because they're at full capacity.  They only kill kittens when...  He's mocking me!  I'm not mocking you!  He's not!  He said kittens!  That's the way you say it whenever there's a hard T sound.  Do you prefer Brooklyn or Manhattan?  Brooklyn.  Have you ever been to Manhattan?  Nope.  You're trying to get me to say Manhattan. 
[01:01:30]  Manhattan.  Damn it.  Do you like Manhattan or Australia?  Australia.  Because they have an accent.  Do you like wearing the gloves with all the fingers or those other things where it's  just the thumb?  What do they call that?  I forgot.  It comes with your thumb and then the other four fingers.  You know, you wear them in the winter.  Gloves?  Not gloves.  Mittens!  All right.  Any more? 
[01:02:00]  Mittens!  Mittens for kittens in Staten Island.  Staten Island and mittens.  It's a very hard T sound, which we like.  Actually, you pronounce it properly.  It just sounds weird.  It's because I'm from the Midwest, Chicago.  No, I know you're from Chicago.  That's why they say kittens.  Kittens.  Kittens.  Spank me.  Kittens.  Kittens.  Manhattan.  Manhattan.  Clittering.  Clittering.  Oh!  Clittering.  Okay.  So, yeah.  So, go get a kitten so they don't die. 
[01:02:30]  All right.  Get a kitten.  Yes.  If you know what that is, go get one.  It's a cat.  Little cat.  Okay.  All right.  So, for the ten people listening to us in Staten Island, they're all going to run out.  No, there's no.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Okay.  Teach me how to say it, Jimmy.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Yeah, Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Yeah.  My tongue goes the other way.  Staten.  Staten.  Staten.  It's like whenever there's a T like there, like Manhattan or Staten, you usually say Manhattan 
[01:03:00]  or Staten Island.  Staten Island.  Or kitten.  Kitten.  Instead of kitten.  Kitten.  No one says Staten Island.  Or kitten.  Manhattan is awful, too.  I guess I got it from Jelliet, Illinois.  How do you say Jim Norton?  Jim Norton.  Okay.  See, that's right.  You have like the N sound.  In Norton, you don't hard the T.  Jim Norton.  I didn't even realize the word ten was in the word kitten until just now.  Kitten.  Kitten.  Staten.  Staten Island.  All right.  I can't help it.  Sorry.  Oh, it's all right. 
[01:03:30]  It's okay, baby.  You're adorable.  Let's go.  Okay.  Did you get the story about the 86-year-old woman in Charlotte, North Carolina?  No.  No?  Why don't you tell me?  She was jailed after police said she called emergency dispatchers 20 times in a little  more than a half hour, all to complain that a pizza parlor wouldn't deliver.  This old relic called 911 20 times.  When the cops came to arrest her, she fought and bit and scratched them?  Yes. 
[01:04:00]  She's like 90 pounds?  Yes.  We're trying to get the audio.  How old is she?  86.  Oh, my gosh.  She's just nuts, though.  Someone like that is just a bonafide nut.  She's crazy, yeah.  She's an old lady.  She's nuts.  She, when the police officers arrived at her apartment, the five-foot-tall, 98-pound  woman attacked the officer, scratching him, kicking him, and bit his hand.  Wow.  Oh, you know, choppers probably popped out on his hand all drooly.  Ugh.  His hand still smells.  Ugh.  Her plaque.  Like baby powder and efferent. 
[01:04:30]  Old lady mouth.  It should smell like fist.  That cop should have put on a glove and just caved her teeth in with his fist.  All 90 pounds of her.  That's a cute little story.  That is a cute little story.  I would love to hear those 911 calls.  She's not as bad, though, as the younger people that do it, because you're 86.  You're obviously a nut.  She's insane.  She's a nut, yeah.  She's just, I mean, she should just be killed.  The Alzheimer's.  That's what I was just going to say.  It was probably that.  What?  Alzheimer's.  Yeah. 
[01:05:00]  What?  I think she's right, actually.  I think you're right.  And then say, I said it right.  How do you say it?  Say it first, though.  No, say it.  Say it.  Say it.  Say it.  You might be right.  Alzheimer's.  You're right.  You're actually right.  He's wrong.  Yeah, he said it right.  He actually pronounces the Z just because of the Z in the words.  How do you say it?  I'm not going to repeat it.  Why?  You're right.  No, you really are right this time, baby.  Go ahead.  No, no, because you're fucking with me right now.  No, no.  No, not at all.  Alzheimer's.  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Fine.  All right.  All right.  Any other stories there?  Me or him? 
[01:05:30]  In a word, I just drop it.  I just remove that Z.  There's no need for it.  All time.  Let's go to the O.  All time.  Alzheimer's.  Yeah.  Anyway, Nebraska states it for me.  It's a news group I go to.  Alt.hymers.  Sex.  You ever go to the O?  Look at the animals.  We're listening.  100.  Go to the O.  Alzheimer's.  And I have another story. 
[01:06:00]  My last story is for Jim.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Okay.  Police in Peoria.  That's Richard Pryor's hometown, by the way.  It's near my hometown.  Peoria.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Pryor's hometown.  New Julia.  Okay.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck.  No, Peoria.  Yeah.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Peoria.  Whatever.  Staten Island and Peoria.  Stop.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck dumbfounded by the first person.  In Illinois?  Yeah, Illinois.  Okay. 
[01:06:30]  It's Illinois.  Yeah.  No, you're right.  Who cares about the I?  It's an E, as far as she's concerned.  God damn it.  You're right.  I love Ellen.  All right.  Illinois.  Well, anyway, can I finish?  Do you like the elephants in the O.  Elephants.  Elephants.  All right.  All right.  Let's start over.  From the top?  Yeah, because...  Yeah, we don't have to know this.  We have ADD.  Go ahead.  All right.  ADD.  Police in Peoria, Illinois, have been struck dumbfounded by the first prostitution case in  the area.  So I thought you'd like this.  Yes.  A 47-year-old Christian school teacher thought her snatch was worth $200. 
[01:07:00]  Yep.  She advertised in an escort ad and was caught by police in her love nest apartment, and a  spokesperson stated that $200 should buy you a hot young call girl in a posh hotel.  So I thought you'd like that prostitution story.  I do.  Prior's mother, funny bit of trivia, was a prostitute.  That's right.  Yeah.  She was a call girl in Peoria, and his grandmother was a madam.  No.  Peoria?  Yeah, Peoria, Illinois.  Yes, that's right.  Peoria.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  Matt from Nebraska has a question for DD.  Matt?  Yo.  Oh, God.  What's up, Matt?  Hi, Matt.  Hey, DD.  I was wondering, are you wearing satin panties or cotton panties?  What type do you wear?  Yeah, do you wear the satin or the...  You just got me to say the T.  Or the cotton.  Or cotton.  Do you like cotton or satin?  I wear both.  What do you prefer?  Well, it depends.  Like, if I'm out, you know, on a date.  The satin. 
[01:08:00]  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Okay, great.  That is really hard to say.  You like satin.  Satin.  And then for just hanging around, you might use the what?  Cotton.  Cotton.  Cotton and satin?  What a chore to speak.  Cotton.  How do you say satin, Reg?  You just say it.  Satin.  God, we all have accents.  We know that, but you're just amazing.  How do you say satin?  Satan.  Satan.  Satan is a devil.  Satan.  Satan.

If we play this again, I'm going to lose it.  I know.  My God.  How many times?  We get it.  Do you think there's new listeners that haven't heard this yet?  Getting new listeners every day.  By the way, it's Opie and Anthony.  We're on vacation because it's like the long holiday weekend. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  It's just a holiday weekend.  We're having a barbecue.  Yeah.  Cook out.  Yeah.  All of us getting together.  We're telling some stories.  We talk with our headphones on, even in real life.  I wear an apron that says, fuck the chef.  And I cook up some hot dogs.  Did you?  I'm having a hard time saying cook.  O&A party rock.  That's right.  O&A party rock.  Do you?  Stupid.  Andrea Yates is there.  World's greatest mom. 
[01:09:30]  She's wearing a charm bracelet.  With five little heads.  Wearing like diving equipment.  All right.  Well, here's Bernie Getz losing it.  On the worst of Opie and Anthony and Lil Jimmy.  World's greatest glub glub.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  I know.  Bernie loves the weekly world news.  Yeah.  Hey, can you believe this? 
[01:10:00]  There's an article.  This is a new revelation about history that the Vikings were sissies.  They were actually sissies.  The Vikings were sissies?  I wonder if I believe this is official.  And they use that word sissies?  Wow.  I don't know if I believe that.  Did you see that one weekly world news where the headline was Bernie gets to the point?  Huh.  Well, this is the news.  This is the news.  I see it.  There's a bunch of pictures of dead animals and stuff.  I can't understand what that is.  That's just for shock value.  There's a crossword puzzle.  I wouldn't even know how to do that. 
[01:10:30]  And then other, let's see, nonsense.  Some personal ads.  Six-letter word for target.  It starts with N.  Here's something everyone here could learn.  Strip club adequate.  Ten essential do's and don'ts.  Okay?  Okay?  Wait, wait.  What was that?  I missed that.  Oh, look.  And there's another.  Oh, so what?  Look, here's another article.  The Republicans now, they're fighting for Caucasian History Month.  Oh.  We want Caucasian.  And they show a picture of Donald Trump shouting with Ronald Reagan standing in the background. 
[01:11:00]  I bet you'd be honored during that month.  They want Caucasian History Month.  I would honor you during that month.  Wait, I'll have to say.  Where's that other thing?  I want to hear.  Strip what?  Strip club what?  What month is he on the Klan calendar?  This is a new one.  Just hit the newsstands.  They have him shirtless for July.  Strip what?  Wait, was that strip club?  What was the name of that?  Oh, look.  Here's other stuff.  History.  Jesus drove his brother to drink.  It's possible.  Adequate.  Get Craig Christ ready.  That's how we'll end this. 
[01:11:30]  You see?  Craig Christ from Stephen Lynch.  This is about vegetarian.  They're showing giant pictures of mutant vegetarian.  Mutant vegetables.  Mutant vegetables.  This is horrible.  Anyway, I'm going to take this home and read it.  Hold on.  Can you go back to the stripper etiquette?  We'll end with stripper etiquette.  Oh, what is there?  You know, you just do nothing.  You know, buy drinks.  Give them, put money in their belt and say nothing is usually the best thing.  Right.  Just look.  Look and enjoy.  Bernie, would you like to go to a strip club with us?  Nah.  No?  No, why not?  We'll take you out.  Oh, thanks.  That'd be fun.  Nah.  Nah? 
[01:12:00]  Nah.  It's just, yeah.  Definitely, yeah.  Nah, yeah.  Okay.  Better porno on the internet.  You've got to get bullets.  So that's the news.  And no news is good news.  Wow, Bernie.  You're safe from the horrible storm.  Definitely easy to shoot a gun and drive a car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Laugh at me.  I'll get out of here.  I'm a good shooter.  I'm definitely a good shooter.  Definitely a good shooter.  Yeah.  And I want my CD back.  What CD?  That one CD.  You played one CD of that nice music in the beginning.  Of course, Wapner comes on it.  That was an arm. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  Remember that arm you played one music of that?  You played about a minute and a half of that?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Goddamn, Bernie.  I love when you come on.  Yeah.  The last love when you come on.  The first 40 minutes were quite boring, but, man, you made up for it.  What are you kidding?  You made up for it for the last 10 minutes.  Well, I didn't mean to.  It's that killer closing biddy kid.  I thought it was the worst.  This was the worst.  What did we learn, Anthony?  That Jesus Christ drove his own brother to drink.  His brother to drink.  That fat chicks make sexy faces sometimes.  Stippers have adequate. 
[01:13:00]  Adequate.  It's easier to shoot a pistol than to drive a car with one hand.  Osma Bin Laden.  Oh, Bernie, what are you doing, Bernie?  Of Osma.  It's right here.  It's right here.  It's right here.  Oh, yeah.  Wait.  No, no, no.  You got to go out of the machine.  Yeah, sit down, Bernie.  It's in a thing.  It's right there.  Oh, yeah, sit down.  I'll get it to you.

All right, sit down.  Stand up for your rights, Bernie.  Sit down, Bernie.  Sit down.  It's okay. 
[01:14:00]  It's all right.  It's okay, Po.  It's okay.  Po, it's okay.  It's okay.  Po, it's okay.  Po, it's okay.  Po, it's okay.  All right, have Bernie sit down.  Bernie, take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  It's all right.  Oh.  I'm going to get that fucking seat.  Oh, yeah.  Hand over that fucking seat.  Oh, you've got to have another.  You lunatic.  All right, Bernie.  He's right, Bernie.  Oh, he's fine, Po.  You tell him to relax.  Po, he's fine.  You tell him to relax.  Yeah, tell him. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, everyone just relax.  Nobody relax.  All he did was take the CD out.  I mean.  Yeah, fuck you.  Keep the CD.  I won't be here again.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.  Bernie.

We'll explain what happened.  Bring him back in.  Bernie.  Come.  Oh, he's going into his back.  Holy shit.  He's going into his back.  No, he's at Bernie.  It's okay.  He's zipping up.  Bernie, we got the CD.  We got the CD. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, he's pissed.  Oh, my God.  He's running out.  Wait, follow him out with the cell phone.  Make sure he knows we never.  It was a fake CD.  No, follow him out with the cell phone.  Opie took a fake.  It wasn't his CD.  Oh, was it a CD?  No, of course not.  And he lost his mind.  Of course not.  Did you get him his CD?  Well, Eric's going after him.  He says he's going to shoot you now.  Holy shit.  He was pissed.  I think we saw some of that rage.  That was that rage.  Yeah.  Wow, that was it.  That was like one of those bad court dramas on TV where the guy finally snaps on the stand.  Finally cracks him.  The lawyer cracks him. 
[01:15:30]  All right, I did it.  See?  All right, hold on.  I think.  And I'm not sorry.  I'd do it again.  All right, let's go to the phones here.  Jesus.  Bernie, this is your CD right there.  Okay, thank you.  That's not the one he...  Relax, that's not the one.  That's yours.  Tell him...  That's the one he used in the studio.  Eric, explain.  Explain what we do.  Bernie, the joke, he had another CD.  Oh, whatever.  It was a separate CD.  Sure?  It was totally...  Take a look at it.  It's not even broken or damaged.  Anyway, it's okay.  Watch you relax. 
[01:16:00]  Watch you relax.  No, no, no.  I want to go...  It's 9 o'clock.  They want to go home anyway.  They still want to call to you.  Let's go back inside and at least let's not burn bridges.  Let's go back in.  Come back in and talk.  He's coming in.  All right.  Nice to meet you.  Wait, that sounds scary.  Hold on.  He's coming in.  They just want to talk to you.  I hope he's building a barrier.  All right, Bernie.  I wait.  Sit down, sit down.  Sit down, sit down.  No, it's 9 o'clock.  Bernie, let me explain what happened, though, Bernie, because I want to explain what happened.  Wait, put on your headphones.  Let me explain.  Yeah.  Let me explain.  Because we really like you. 
[01:16:30]  We want you to be a friend of the show.  I love Bernie Getz, and I don't want to get off on a...  You know, the wrong foot here.  We felt like...  Here.  I'm listening.  I'm listening.  We felt like you were a friend of the show that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all that was.  It was a joke.  It was a joke.  Here's the...  Wait, here.  I'm going to show you.  Calm down.  Here's the CD I was smashing.  Okay, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Here's...  The CD I was smashing was called Haunted Pussy.  Oh, okay.  That's okay.  It had nothing to do with the one that...  You were smashing Haunted Pussy!  You bad!  Bernie, I never touched your CD.  I took this one, and Eric snuck it in and, you know, made the old 
[01:17:00]  switcheroo.  Bernie, we still pals?  Things are okay.  All right.  Things are okay.  Yes, I'm glad we had this story.  I'm glad we had this story.  A friend of mine.  I consider you...  Okay, or just...  Or whatever.  Bernie, look at your CD.  He doesn't like it.  Bernie, not like...  It's okay.  Look at your CD.  There's not a scratch on it.  I didn't smash you.  I trust you.  All right?  You don't have to look at it.  I thought we were at that stage in our friendship that we could pull one of our gags on you.  That's all.  Well, I didn't smash your CD, though.  He brings it in.  It's like...  I mean, it wasn't as bad as what if someone took your kid and said, I'm hanging your kid 
[01:17:30]  out the window like Michael Jackson.  Well, there you go.  That's bad.  I know.  It's not bad.  It's only a CD.  There you go.  All right, Bernie.  So we're cool.  We're cool.  And anyway, that's the news for the week.  Thank you, Bernie.  Okay?  Very good.  Bernie gets everybody.  Now that everybody knows what's happening in the world, you know?  I hear you.  And is...  All right.  Is up on...  Phew!  Yeah, that was cool in the gang.  That was intense.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You guys are...  Now I know what those guys felt on that subway.  I'll tell you that much.  Oh, boy, you got mad.  Just all night and day. 
[01:18:00]  The way he could turn it on.  Yeah.  He really turned it on.  Oh, what a quick fuse.  That's not a slow burn.  You taking the subway home?  Everything's cool, Bernie.  Everything is...  Opus, shut the fuck up!  We're going to be like little Fonzies.  And what's Fonzie, Bernie?  I don't know.  Cool.  Cool.  Oh, yeah.  That's okay.  All right.  Yeah, Bernie, we didn't watch you...  We didn't watch you...  It's going to be a mild winter.  We didn't watch you going away mad.  Are you all right?  All right.  Is that you?  Oh, you dropped something, Bernie?  All right. 
[01:18:30]  There you go.  Okay.  That looks like the same ski jacket he was probably wearing back in the knee.  Okay, guys.  Absolutely.  All right.  Thank you, Bernie.  Thank you.  Bernie, guys.  We'll talk to you again soon.  Is this Bernie?  Is this yours?  Holy S.  No, no.  It's...  Yeah.  Did I get him?  Yes, you did.  He was coming back in.  All right.  He's walking out.  Wow, man.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That was legendary.  Dude, that was the rage.  That was what happened on that train.  Oh, my God.  I'm not even kidding.  That was what happened on that train. 
[01:19:00]  We saw it.  We saw it.  Yeah.  Eric was in between me and Bernie, and I got to give Eric a lot of credit, man.  He was holding him back.  He was out of his mind.  You know what's odd?  We were talking about Rain Man, and when you were watching Rain Man, remember, it was  kind of like you look at Dustin Hoffman and go, it's not too bad.  He's a little kooky and stuff, but he seems nice and sweet.  And then that time he lost it at the airport?  Oh, yeah.  He just like...  He just lost his mind.  That's what we saw.  That snap.  That was right now.  You just threw his CD.  It was like a Pop-Tart in the toaster, and a little smoke billowed up, and he couldn't 
[01:19:30]  handle it.  Right.  Imagine that, though.  No, but you didn't see it coming.  No.  It came out of nowhere.  He just...  Fuck you.  Keep your CD.  Keep your CD.  Fuck you.  And take this with you.  Have another.  Keep your CD.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah.  I have...  Look at me.  I'm still...  I'm still shaking.  I am shaking.  Dude, you had a pissed Bernie Gats right here in your face. 
[01:20:00]  And there's no reasoning with him when he's that mad.  You can't reason with him.  No.  No.  He just walked out.  Yeah.  He was convinced you smashed that CD.  That was one of his things.  You see how he was looking for it before you made Like You Smashing?  He came over to Opie's area, looked through those CDs that Opie's got in front of him,  going, there was a CD.  I have it.  Because he needs to know where everything is.  Yeah.  Very particular.  Yeah.  Or there's something wrong with him in the world. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  And then he sat back down.  You told him that the CD you had in your hand was the CD in question.  When you started smashing it, the look on his face, that's when he snapped.  Keep your fucking CD.  Rawr.  Wow.  Eric, is he all right?  He's gone.  Eric, you, I have to tell you, you rock.  No problem.  Eric got in between me and Bernie.  Bernie was literally like, what?  He kept kneeing me in the legs.  I'm like, stop.  He's like, give me my CD, my CD.  And I'm sitting here with this hand trying to cover his real CD so he doesn't see it. 
[01:21:00]  Nope.  He's just sitting there going, oh, my God.  Could you imagine if he's got to go on the subway right now?  Some black guy is in his seat or something?  Oh, forget it.  With an iPod?  Disrespecting CDs?  All right.  Bernie, what's the matter?  Hot water burn baby.  Hot water burn baby.  Fucking psychopath.  Why don't we take a break?  We have Billy Byrne in studio.  And that's the news for today.  Keep your fucking CD. 
[01:21:30]  I pushed the CD in the case.  It does this when it's told.  It does this when it's told.  And you want your CD, Bernie?  Would you?  Would you?  Wait a minute.  Would she be a great big black person?  We're going to do that.  That CD, was that track 14?  Wow.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Billy Byrne in studio, like I said.  And also we have Joe Rogan's gangsta fag stuff that he wants to turn us on to.  We'll finally play a few tracks from that next, okay?  Fine. 
[01:22:00]  Keep your fucking CD.  But first, you know, Bernie Getz was talking about how Jesus Christ, you know, drove his own brother to drink.  He was.  I forgot everything that happened.  Well, it's just.  Before that snap.  It's just a seg to.  Just a segway.  The blood's still going.  Huh?  The heart rate's still up.  I know.  That was really, like, exciting.  Poe came in here with the.  He was the second most crazy person in this room.  That look in his eyes.  And he went to grab Bernie.  And Bernie was, like, pissed.  Everyone was just out of their minds. 
[01:22:30]  Poe was in the other room calming down doing his little.  Oh, doing his calm down procedure.  Did they get video of that?  Yeah, we have it all.  Danny was in here the whole time?  Yep, he stayed right there with the camera.  Oh, nice.  Get Danny in here.  I've got to see how the video looks.  Did Poe make a wrong turn and go into the production studio first before he came in here?  I don't know what happened.  Or did he know the directions to get here to this studio?  The problem is in his office there's a delay, so he was hearing it late.  Oh, wow.  Hot in here.  Yeah, he heard the eye.  It's getting hot.  It looks like rain. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, it certainly looks like rain tonight.  John.  Yo.  Hey.  John.  How fucking crazy are you to piss off Bernie Katz in the goddamn studio?  Yeah, it's not smart.  Yeah, I hope he's an idiot.  Ed Asner's one thing.  He's 80.  Yeah, what's Ed Asner going to do?  And Ed has never shot anyone.  Exactly.  It's not like it's Psycho Patty or anything, man.  Wow, yeah.  Dude, I never expected him to go like that.  I thought he'd get a little pissed off and bummed out. 
[01:23:30]  I never expected him to lose his mind like he did.  All right.  All right, thank you.  Master Poe, you all right?  No, no.  I'm going to talk to Marcelino, and I'm going to find out.  What's up?  I want to get a patch directly into my room because this delay is no good.  Oh, yeah, the 15 seconds of my...  Yeah.  All right.  My heart is...  It's all good, bro.  You did great.  You did great.  It's good.  But I want to get a patch.  What do you do to calm down, Poe?  I heard, like, you just kind of sit... 
[01:24:00]  Poe is pissed off now, too.  Poe is freaking right now.  Nothing was going to happen.  If it came down to it, all of us would have piled on Bernie.  We just didn't want to go there.  That's all.  He is what they call in the zone right now.  Well, plus, there's not many problems in the studio, so when there is one, you're the  security guy, you don't want to, like, not be there.  15-second delay.  A lot can happen.  I'm sure, though, he shot those four guys in a lot less than 15 seconds on that subway.  Yeah, Bernie can do a lot of damage.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, you know, no one's hearing it. 
[01:24:30]  Please.  No one hears...  Yeah, you're the security guy 15 seconds after the fact.  He's hearing what's going on.  We'll get him a direct patch.  This is what we do, though.  We create major havoc, and the only ones that are enjoying it are you and I.  Oh, yeah.  Poe's pissed.  Everyone's freaked now.  Ben is on the phone with Washington now.  Why do you say we?  There's one problem in the studio.  There's one fucking irritant constantly hurting and annoying guests.  Poking and prodding a Bernie guest.  Always.  But I'm saying you guys enjoy it, though. 
[01:25:00]  Yes.  Of course.  It was incredible.  Who else was freaked out when he was running for his bags?  Bernie's probably on his way to a pawn shop right now.  That's great.  Todd from California.  That man wants to be the mayor?  I know.  Jesus.  He might have wrecked his whole campaign.  Hope he'd be the guy if we had Ted Bundy as a guest.  Let's get some girls in here naked.  Come on.  Bring in the nude girls.  You could give them a laugh dance.  A waiting pool full of mud and a 12-year-old.  Ted, here, hold this blunt object. 
[01:25:30]  Now bring in the girls.  They're all whores, aren't they, Ted?  Come on in, ladies.  Yeah, these girls were bringing in their filthy whores, Ted.  Here's a bat.  We got Ted Bundy audio?  Yeah, that's when he's having sex with his girlfriend.  He's telling her to lay there and pretend she's dead.  What's that from?  The movie.  Oh, the movie.  Oh, the movie.  Which one was that?  Who played him in that one?  Mark Harmon.  Was it Mark Harmon?  Yeah.  That was a good one.  I liked the Mark Harmon, Ted Bundy. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  Why don't we play Craig Christ?  Or Ted Bungy, as Bernie would call him.  Could he get one name right?  Al Bundy.  Martin Scorsese.  What did he say?  Rodgy.  That was my favorite one.  Rodgy Dangerfield.  Rodgy Dangerfield.  Oh, you're a very dangerous man.  Bernie Gates.  Rodgy.  Now I keep you fucking saying.  He ran right over, pointing.  Oh, he was.  Oh, was he mad?  He was the irate white man.  He was fucking angry. 
[01:26:30]  Michael Douglas falling down.  Right.  Falling down.  That was it.  Bernie.  I'm like you, man.  God damn.  I'm just like you.  That's every thug's worst nightmare is some bespectacled guy with a pistol who gets mad  that fucking quickly.  Looks like the mild-mannered, easy Mark.  Yeah.  And he just loses his mind.  When he went out and grabbed his bag, his black bag, and put it up on the file cabinet,  I'm like, oh my God, here it comes.  Here it comes.  We're getting the best publicity we've ever had. 
[01:27:00]  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  Frontier justice.  As much as I'd hate to see Opie get shot, what that would do for fucking gigs for the  next year.  Oh, forget about it.  Every radio station in the country would want you on.  That would be huge.  Talk show circuit.  If you pulled through, his record isn't that good.  You know, he shot four guys and none of them died, so you probably live.  So much for that vegetarian angle he has.  Yeah.  So much for the vegetarians making you mellow.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ, have another piece of broccoli and I'll take some asparagus. 
[01:27:30]  We have a fucking CD.  Put the CD in the fucking basket.  Oh, yeah.  Enough about the friggin' soy milk and broccoli and soybeans.  Wow.  That was great that we really got to see him do his thing.  No one gives a shit about him running for office.  No.  We want to see you snap and go into a murderous rage.  That's what we wanted to see.  That was it right there.  It took four hours.  What if you wanted to see that?  Four hours of horrible news. 
[01:28:00]  Four hours.  It took four or five appearances.  Yeah.  He's actually been on our show about four times, so it took that long to actually make him  snap.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Chris.  What's up, man?  Oh, hey.  What's going on, ONA?  Hey.  Hey, man.  The best part of that whole shit was as soon as you hear the CD break, you hear Bernie Gap go,  you motherfucker.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You motherfucker.  He was pissed.  You can just hear him snapping.  Is there any way to pull that audio before the end of the show? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, definitely.  I want to hear him losing his mind.  I've got to hear him losing his mind.  We'll replay it after the break.  Dave, what's up?  Yeah, I want to know what you think he would actually have done if he actually had gotten  to Opie.  I don't know.  He probably would have hit him.  He probably would have hit him.  Yeah, I didn't want to get to that point, so I used poor Eric as a blocker.  He would have hit you for disrespecting him.  I mean, he used lethal force last time.  Would he have, uh, took his thumbs into your eyeballs?  That guy would use the gun at a drop of it.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think he's, he doesn't strike me as a grappler. 
[01:29:00]  No, no, no.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Maybe a bitch slap.  I saw him walking down the street looking like a raving lunatic.  He had a shovel, and he was talking about Vermont.  I don't know what that meant.  It's where he's buried, by the way.  He buried his gun.  It's still there somewhere.  All right.  Well.  Whew.  All right.  We'll do, uh.  A lot of people saying don't lose Bernie as a friend of the show.  No, we won't.  No, he'll, he'll be back.  No one else is going to let him talk for an hour about nothing.  Of course.  No one who has advertisers to answer to would allow that nonsense.

Technology fads are inescapable.  One minute all you hear about is internet radio, then it's podcasting, followed up by online poker.  The poker craze has inspired several poker nerds to write software that tells them the best way to bet. 
[01:30:30]  Counting cards in a real casino will get you tossed out.  But poker bots are being used to prey on newcomers, help with strategy, and in the end, make money.  It's bad enough that the 25-year-old blonde that you're chatting with is probably a fat guy just out of prison.  Now you could be playing poker against a computer and not even know it.  Some say that poker players are being paranoid, and the software needed for the intricate process of reading other cards, bluffing, and folding is years away. 
[01:31:00]  But in the end, if you're up at midnight betting away your paycheck, whether you're playing against man or machine, it's called gambling for a reason.  I'm Laszlo.com.

Hi, this is Jay Moore, and I'm supposed to say something witty and funny here. 
[01:31:30]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, and suck it.  Fuck, I can't do any, Steve.  Maury and the Freaks.  Maury!  Yeah, we were completely sidetracked this day by Maury Povich and his freak show he puts on on a daily basis.  Parades out the little freaks.  You know, the kids, sometimes they got no arms, sometimes they got the birth defects, whatever.  He parades them out there, and we were completely sidetracked.  Jim Gaffigan, I think, was horrified at some of our comments, but it's fun. 
[01:32:00]  Laugh along with us, Maury and the Freaks.  This was a repulsive bit.  It really was.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, my God.  Whoa!  Oh, my God.  Our children look different.  Please don't stare.  How do you feel about it?  And your family loves you for you?  Son Maury.  High school was rough for you?  No.  Up until, like, the middle of my senior year, it was hard.  Once I became a cheerleader, I was... 
[01:32:30]  Stop.  A cheerleader?  Stop it!  Oh, yeah.  Applaud.  Give me an A.  Give me an A.  Give me an S.  Give me a K.  Did I spell mask wrong?  You said A.  I said A twice.  Started with A.  Give me an S.  All right.  Why am I a comedian?  Shit.  Classrooms until she became a cheerleader were filled with pain.  And this is the way it went.  Here we go.  Yeah.  I haven't stepped foot in this high school since my senior year. 
[01:33:00]  That's a nice body.  And the last time I was here was when I graduated six years ago.  That's the locker I was pushed into when I was in high school.  I was throwing her face.  This was the locker that my head picked a thousand and one times in the beginning of my senior year.  Why would they...  It's hard to be back here.  Just look.  Sitting in the locker.  It's hard.  I remember walking through the halls.  Ugh.  What are they blurring out?  Her nipple.  Is our nipple popping out?  It's not Halloween.  They blurring out.  Oh my God.  The one redeeming part of her. 
[01:33:30]  They block it.  That will kill me.  This room brings back so many memories.  The bathroom.  Wow.  Yeah, her nipples totally popping through that shirt.  This is where I hid.  Is that from an accident?  I hid.  She looks like scarred or something.  Because everybody made fun when I went in the bathroom.  It's just all right.  I don't know.  Her jaw is huge.  She has a great body though, man.  There's a lot of bad things that happen to me.  Huge jaw and a big tongue it looks like, right?  Gums, teeth all up in the air. 
[01:34:00]  The pain.  But look, she's got like a scar on her neck.  I don't want to go through the heart.  I wish I had the opportunity to fill this auditorium with everyone that made fun of me.  She sounds like Marco.  Because I would tell even every one of them that I did not deserve to be made fun of pushing the lockers and teeth because I am...  Oh, you go, girl.  What do you think you deserve?  Go, girl.  Wow.  I brought to the surface.  Very painful memories.  Looks like she's swallowed an M80 hors d'oeuvre. 
[01:34:30]  What is the point of this show?  Maury Povich, by the way.  Except for Maury just capitalizing off of someone's deformity.  That's what it is.  Maury is Barnum and Bailey of the new century.  He brings people on.  It's a freak show every day.  And it's under the guise that he's helping them.  I am a journalist and political science major.  I love politics.  I love journalism.  I would love to be an intern in TV and production.  Really? 
[01:35:00]  Oh.  In production?  I'd love to be an intern.  Well, guess what?  Get my coffee.  We have a surprise for you.  Old steam shovel jaw.  A surprise.  Here comes a surprise.  Hi, Christine.  We're the Maury Show interns.  And we want to show you just how much fun we have.  We'd love to read mail from our Maury viewers.  Things like smiling and chewing gum.  Where's my bagel?  And club soda.  They're going to give her an internship with the Maury Show? 
[01:35:30]  Is that what we asked of our interns?  That wasn't staged.  No.  I don't know if Harry was also interning over at Maury.  Preferably one who's...  Oh, she's crying.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Jesus.  She looks even prettier when she cries.  Well, blow me down. 
[01:36:00]  I'm an intern.  They should have got her an intern in the clan.  Before I know I see her dumb face.  Oh, shit.  I'm alive.  You've got to be kidding.  It's like she said...  She goes, I want to be a journalist.  They're like...  Oh, my God.  She got no arms this next one.  It's the Maury Freak Show.  You don't have any arms. 
[01:36:30]  I'm still the diamond that there's nothing under the sun she can't do.  A lot of things she can't do.  It is so disfigured that she never leaves her house.  You know, I look in a mirror sometimes, but I see myself as a monster.  Yeah, well, I want more...  They...  Look, if you took the same people and put them under a tent and charged people to come in,  it would be a freak show.  Right.  It's the same thing.  He's just parading these freaks around on his stage.  The island of Dr. Maury. 
[01:37:00]  I love how on Oprah, Oprah gives these real gifts, and then Maury just hires them with free jobs.  Now you can work for me for nothing, sweetheart.  Get me my coffee.  I'd like to be a journalist.  You can work for me.  Getting my coffee.  How about a dribble cup?  One cup of coffee?  I got a coming up.  The big jaw and one eye is shut. 
[01:37:30]  Where's me pipes?  Give me some spinach.  Horrid.  Horrid.  I don't know who she looks like.  Oh, that old no arms is coming on next.  That's great.  We're supposed to sit here and not laugh?  I know.  Jesus.  Well, no arms, what's your story?  Well, I've been raped 445 times.  Awful. 
[01:38:00]  Maury's been doing this act, and it's been working for him.  We had him on our show once and asked him.  I was like, Maury, what are you doing?  You just, you parade around freaks on your show.  It's a freak show.  He admitted it.  Under the guise, and he's like, hey.  He said something like, hey, I got to make a living.  He knows what he's doing.  He doesn't have, you think he cares about this woman?  You think he hangs out with the Pejoria kids after the taping?  Yeah.  That's it.  Maury, you said you were going to set up a whole softball team for us kids with Pejoria.  Get away from me, you little fucker.  Give me the creeps. 
[01:38:30]  We're done with you.  He hid them in his office once.  He had these little Pejoria kids, and they were real little.  And as a gag, he had one in his trash can.  No, he didn't.  Yes, he did.  One on his shelf.  And he's like, where's Mindy?  Where's Mindy?  And he'd go, is she in here?  To show how little they are.  And he'd open up his desk drawer.  Hi, Maury.  And this alien, this thing that was dropped off from a fucking spaceship, is in his drawer.  And then he's like, where's Billy? 
[01:39:00]  Billy, I hear you.  I don't see you.  I'm in the trash can, Maury.  He's in the fucking garbage can.  In the garbage can.  How funny it would be if one of the workers just dumped it out in the big bin and rolled  him into the dumpster, compacted him with the rest of the trash.  What about the one on the shelf?  Yeah, and one was sitting on the shelf like a bookend.  Like a bookend.  Where's little Shelly?  Here I am, Maury.  That's right.  Right behind the Da Vinci code. 
[01:39:30]  You're not doing that to help people.  It's a freak show.  Look how tiny this is.  Look how tiny this little person is.  And he acts like he cares, but then the show's over, and I think he's kicking them to the curb.  I'm out of here.  How perfect that garbage can was.  Get all five of them in there.  Oh, my God.  That's the biggest laugh I've had in a long time.  Leave it for the foreigner to take out.  Tie up the bag.  Hey, wait.  We're in here.  The majority of kids are classic, though.  They want to just be like regular kids.  Now, you're eight years old, aren't you? 
[01:40:00]  You're just like any other eight-year-old boy, but you're in the body of a 68-year-old man.  That's right, Maury.  I like playing ball.  You know, go out there, swing the bat a little bit.  Anything that a normal kid does.  A normal kid that looks like he was born in Chernobyl and grew up on Three Mile Island and now live in Love Canal.  That's a 70s reference.  I like that.  Oh, please.  And it's – look at what it is. 
[01:40:30]  Our children look different.  Please don't stare.  Yeah, because if you stare, it's one person looking at you as opposed to a few million on television.  Because she contacted us about somebody very special in her life, and this person is her 14-year-old sister, Diamond.  She had a contact.  This one can't pick up the phone.  Because Diamond was born with no arms.  But it doesn't stop this young teen from living a normal life like other girls her age.  Unless normal is doing cartwheels.  Now, let me tell you, it was no coincidence that Diamond was named after a precious stone. 
[01:41:00]  She was.  When I first laid eyes on my daughter Diamond, she was the most beautiful baby you would ever want to see.  The name Diamond fit her perfectly.  As a baby growing up, I was very happy, and my parents treated me the same as any other child would be treated.  When I was little, my parents did everything for me.  I remember them throwing the best birthday parties and taking me to see Santa on Christmas and dressing me as a cute little girl.  What do you want?  What do you think, fatso?  What do you want besides not mittens? 
[01:41:30]  I'm so happy because I had someone to play with.  My big sister is special because she helps me do a lot of things, and she's my role model.  She's nice.  She makes me laugh.  And even though she doesn't have arms, she doesn't let it get her down.  Sometimes I'm sad because she doesn't have arms, and she can't do things that I can do.  But I'm happy because that's my best friend, and I don't know what I'll do.  She's naked.  She doesn't have arms, and I still love her, and I'll do that for my people to give birth. 
[01:42:00]  That was great.  That was real quick.  Dily, are those tears of joy, happiness?  Yes.  Yes, Maureen.  Because?  It just touches my heart to hear how my younger daughter speaks so highly of her older sister.  She's nice.  And how much of the inspiration she is to her.  Not only her, but myself.  That's right.  Yeah.  That's right.  Let's parade her out here. 
[01:42:30]  Let's get that human chase lounge out here.  Bring on the walking surfboard.  Wow.  Yes, she is.  Yes, she is.  Let's bring her out.  How does she wipe her crack?  Really?  With her feet?  A bidet, maybe?  What, do you scoot on the rug?  Scoot on the rug?  Oh, they've shown her sweeping with her feet and ironing.  All of them can do that.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jim's so unimpressed. 
[01:43:00]  All of them can do that.  Why don't you stand up here and be the big television host and introduce the world to  your big sister.  She's eating with her.  Maury Povich.  Maury Povich has to be part Satan.  He absolutely is the worst man ever.  And here she comes, ladies and gentlemen.  All right.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Jesus.  Wow.  She looks like she's cold all the time.  It does.  She does absolutely look blue screened. 
[01:43:30]  You're right.  You want to hug your little sister?  Hug your little sister.  You want to hug your sister?  Exactly.  Just put your face awkwardly in her.  She said you want to hug your little sister.  She's got no fucking arms, Maury.  What do you think of that?  What do you think of your little sister?  I think that she's just wonderful.  Your sister talks about she doesn't want anybody treating you any different than anybody  else.  Do you ever get sad?  Jesus.  I'm a rapper.  The way you are.  If you don't want me to touch your tit, slap my hand away. 
[01:44:00]  Exactly.  Does it bother you that when you lift your head, candy falls out of your neck?  We who are meeting you for the first time and see the way you are, we're saying ourselves  that I don't remember what a day is like in the life of Diamond.  So we went to her home.  Of course you did.  And we watched Diamond go through the day.  Because part of a freak show is watching the freaks do an act.  Even though Diamond has no arms, she begins her day just like everyone else.  No.  I don't shut off my alarm clock with my foot. 
[01:44:30]  Right.  Because my cock.  It may not be with my real hands, but I call my feet with my hands.  And it all gets done the same way.  Great.  Like many teen girls her age, Diamond likes to look her best.  And that means doing all she can to look good.  She's putting an earring with her foot.  Diamond needs help from her sister to complete her overall look.  I like helping my sister get ready to go to school in the morning.  And I love her and I'll do anything for her.  What is she doing?  She has to take a dump at school. 
[01:45:00]  Determined to live a normal life, Diamond goes about the house.  Oh my God.  She's up on the counter making peanut butter and jelly with her feet.  With her feet.  She makes herself at home in the kitchen and fixes lunch.  But don't underestimate this amazing chat.  She's cooking with pots and pans on the stove with her feet.  She's making mush and cuticles.  Anybody want some?  I'll have some of the athlete's corn. 
[01:45:30]  Waiter, there's a sock in my suit.  Oh, it's that horrid.  I feel like I'm going to take a shower.  Isn't that horrible?  Wow.  You know, we make no delusions as to what we're here for.  Yeah.  And where we're headed.  It's trash.  Mari is more despicable than...  It's like T-ball for you guys.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Tee it up.  Mari is actually under the guise of helping these people.  Oh. 
[01:46:00]  Let's show her doing things.  Show her brushing her teeth on her feet.  You guys want some more of this?  Yeah.  How much footage you got?  Hug your sister.  Kate Moore.  Make her do things with her feet.  Make her eat with her feet.  I don't care if she doesn't really do it.  You can do the peanut butter sandwich.  How about something hot?  Cook something in the pot.  Stir around some mush.  Grab a meatball, you little jig.  This isn't good for the ratings.  People keep throwing dishes on her because they think she's an armless war. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, she wanted to joust, but she didn't have a suit of armorless.  We got a problem, kids.  Who's this?  Who's this?  Yeah, I'll be Nancy and Jimmy.  Yeah, who's this?  This is Bob, the trucker.  Hi, Bob.  Hi, Bob.  I let you, I'm a new subscriber to XM. 
[01:47:00]  I let you guys ever know.  Man, it's really sick what you guys have done.  Oh.  Why is that?  Do you guys have any kids?  Let me ask you a question before you go on.  I do have a kid.  Let me ask you a question.  Hold on.  Whoa.  Let me ask you a question.  Maury Povich is exploiting these kids for ratings and parading them on television.  What we're doing is just making fun of it, but we're not the ones putting them on television  or exploiting them.  So the real sick thing is Maury doing what he does.  The parents are just trying to get some kind of closure. 
[01:47:30]  It's not what we're doing.  You're right.  He's sick, too.  I don't even watch Maury, but, man.  You're missing some good TV today.  If I had two, I've got two kids, and if either one of them was born like that, it would  just be a crime.  I do not.  Please.  I absolutely know.  I mean, what do you think pillows were made for?  You guys can find something else to make fun of.  I mean, that's real bad.  We're not making fun of old golf tee.  Did you like any of those?  Look, I didn't mean to make fun of the human toilet snake. 
[01:48:00]  I mean, that was inappropriate.  All right.  What goes around comes around, guys.  No, it doesn't.  Really?  What did Dana Reeves do besides care for her husband and then get fucking lung cancer?  What goes around comes around.  Does it really?  So where's her act of kindness from somebody?  Where?  She's not dead yet.  Don't bury her yet.  Well, what has her kid Will done?  His father couldn't hug him for 10 years, and his mother now has lung cancer.  What goes around comes around.  Does it really?  Yes, it does.  So explain that to me. 
[01:48:30]  Give her a chance.  Explain that to me.  Why they should have to deal with this.  It's idiotic what you're saying, dude.  There's no such thing as karma or any of that shit when you're joking about stuff.  Karma chameleon.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that cheers everybody up.  And we've made a lot of people's lives a lot happier.  So where's that karma?  That's right.  Where's that karma?  Where is it?  That's right.  Where the hell is it?  And I lied.  I don't have any kids.  I just wanted you to shut up for a second.  I hate kids.  Well, I hope that you do have kids. 
[01:49:00]  It's just a little bit of armless humor.  Wait, the other one's up there.  I didn't want to go to this again, but since he called, I think we're obligated.  What is this one?  Her condition is so disfigured.  It goes around, comes around.  Unless it's a boomerang, then you can't catch it.  Without covering her entire body, she actually feels that she is too ugly to leave her home.  Now she's backstage.  Wow.  And in just a few minutes, we're going to ask her to come out here.  I think in this case, she's pretty accurate.  So she can be in front of a public audience. 
[01:49:30]  My gosh, we're talking to her mother, Janice.  How long has it been since she's been out in public without covering herself up?  Well, it's been a many years.  A long time now.  I'll stop counting.  Quite a skin condition there.  It happened when she was 12, and now she's 22.  She looks like she should be in a Tim Burton film.  So at least 10 years.  Yeah.  She comes off, but she's almost caught.  It's a new thing called yuckaderma.  She covers herself up.  Yeah, in the summertime.  Because of it.  I told her not to swim in the Exxon station.  You're not embarrassed, are you, about her? 
[01:50:00]  No, I'm not embarrassed about her.  I just feel so sad and so sorry.  Sad.  Really?  You're not?  Your fucking womb did that, stupid.  You should be embarrassed.  Close it.  I want to tell you.  I want to go back there.  Shut it.  I'm going to bring her out here.  Yeah.  Of course you will.  Oh, Mari's going to go back and make it okay.  Look at the line of shit he's going to give her.  It would be funny if it was the next time he was wearing gloves on.  Hi.  Give me a hug.  He touches the nurse.  Look at him touching her.  And he's got to do it very, like, he's touching, he's rubbing her shoulder. 
[01:50:30]  Some of my family hasn't seen me this way, you know.  A lot of my friends haven't seen me this way.  She was like a burn victim.  Yeah.  It's all big, peeling, white spots all over.  Looks like she got the vitiligo.  Last night, we asked Laura in a very private moment what it was like to be 22 years old  and look so different than anybody else.  Watch.  When I was 11 years old, this came out of the blue. 
[01:51:00]  Out of the blue!  Suddenly, like a wildfire spread.  Oh!  What does it cause from?  My hands start to close.  I don't know.  Then my arms, then my legs start to get worse.  It's hard for me to walk some way.  Jesus.  When I look in the mirror, sometimes I see myself as a monster.  Sometimes I worry that no one will be able to accept me for what I am and love me.  That's sad.  When inside, some days I feel alone. 
[01:51:30]  The hardest part for me is...  I had to finally stop sleeping in the crock pot.  See, my mom hurt because there's nothing that she can do to help me.  I mean, if I had a cold, she can do cough medicine.  She couldn't baste you.  Oh, barbecued chicken skin.  She feels hopeless, and I do too sometimes.  That's the one thing that I want people to know about me is that I'm a good person.  Inside.  That's not what they think of me outside.  Her face is unaffected, but, man, it's creeping up quick. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  It's creeping up.  I just see the pitch meeting where, like, Maury's like, all right, what do we got?  We got a woman with no arms.  We got a woman.  He goes, eh, she's not messed up.  Not good enough.  Not the clincher.  Yeah, definitely.  They have meetings.  What do we got?  What do we got?  Maury kind of has some kind of strange smirk on his face, like, oh, this makes me look good.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Look at him touching her.  Look how good I am.  Yeah, look at me touching her.  Why is she just, her legs are so skinny, too?  Now, Janice, you don't know this, but your daughter has a special message for you.  Oh, boy.  Let's go to another video.  And she made it backstage.  Very important to make sure people cry.  Dear Mommy, no words could ever express how thankful I am to have such 11.  And give me mother.  We've cried so much throughout these trying years.  But no matter how bad my days get, you're always right beside me to help me through. 
[01:53:00]  Couldn't get the right stuff burning for you.  And you inspire me when I'm about to give up.  I love you so much, and I thank God every day, that of all the moms in the world, I got you.  Love, Lord.  Yeah, great.  Love with you.  Oh, that's wonderful.  God loves you, baby.  Anything you want to tell you?  I sometimes look at this, and I wonder if these kids even want to be on this show.  I know.  We're going to New York.  Yeah, we're going on Maury. 
[01:53:30]  I don't want to do that.  I don't want to do that.  Because in between, during commercials, they put up this sign that says,  if your child has a debilitating disease or something that we can laugh at, call Maury.  And everybody's going to say, but if you like to draw, how do you handle it?  Oh, stop.  That was awful.  What, that awful dumb angel she did?  No problem?  No problem.  No problem painting?  No problem.  Wow.  Thank you so much.  All her paintings have really nice, hot chicks.  Who's that last one of? 
[01:54:00]  All right.  That's good.  She's the queen of long shirts and slacks.  Rob from Chicago, Bob from Chicago says, hey, leave old peel and eat alone.  You are a horrible man.  Let's say hi to Darren.  Oh, wait, more.  Oh, no, no.  Hey, Darren.  Oof.  Hey, there.  Jesus. 
[01:54:30]  What's up, Darren?  Yes.  What's up?  Am I on the air?  Yes, you're on the radio.  I'm sorry.  I had a quick question about the armless girl.  Do you think she feels that everyone on the roller coaster is taunting her when it's heading downhill?  Now, what is this girl about?  She's got this one.  A big cheek.  Is that what that is?  She's got tumors on one side of her face.  No, not this one.  What is it?  I got to know what she's got.  I didn't realize there was anything wrong until the baby was in my arms. 
[01:55:00]  I can't watch this.  Are you having a baby?  We had no idea of what extent of her problems were.  That's pretty awful.  I was very scared.  Jesus, fix that.  There was much more involved than what we had thought originally.  She is the most beautiful little girl.  Um, to you.  No, she's not.  And we have never grasped what the public has seen when they look at our little girl.  We went to the store and the cashier told Alex she could take off her Halloween mask.  That cashier was Jimmy Norton. 
[01:55:30]  And for Alex, because she truly knew at that time that the public does see her as something different.  Take off your Halloween mask.  We left the store.  She doesn't look like.  She doesn't look like.  I got a car.  Alex cried.  Put some makeup on.  She does.  She looks.  And I cried too.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm blind.  I don't see it.  I don't see it's that bad.  She makes me feel happy if I'm having a bad day.  She just puts a smile on my face.  I love her to the laying back and she's really there for me and doing the hard times. 
[01:56:00]  It's like she didn't listen.  Why don't you just go and guide a slay or something?  We didn't know that it was a health issue or a medical issue.  She was a large baby, so we assumed it was from going through the birth canal.  So I just assumed she was severely bruised.  Jesus.  What, he got a mine shaft in there with wooden beams?  That kid broke her nose into a cunt, did she?  Not right away because, like, we didn't know, but later, I think most parents feel guilty.  Jim Gaffigan is horrified at this display. 
[01:56:30]  Horrified.  She's a terrific girl.  She is.  Terrific girl.  You probably have a lot of pride in her.  Yes.  She's probably shown a lot of courage.  She is, and I think she's amazing if we didn't have to deal with the rest of the world.  Yeah.  We should all be as proud of her as you are, so let's meet her.  Here she is, your loving 13-year-old Alexander.  Aw, poor little kid.  That's horrible.  It's not that bad.  No, it's not. 
[01:57:00]  Boring.  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  Well, that's what it's all about.  She's not that bad, so we don't give her the attention that she rightfully deserves.  Oh, yeah, she's kind of messed up.  Wiping her tears off with a paint roller.  Big face.  They're terrible.  Oh, poor kid.  We've got some surprises.  Just awesome.  Some surprises.  Target are giving you a big back-to-school gift certificate. 
[01:57:30]  You go to Target.  Great.  That's what someone with a deformity means.  Target.  We'll be right back.  Put it on your bag.  So the children will know who to throw eggs at.  Oh, she looks different.  She is great.  She's just beautiful.  That has to have a tail.  I would bet $100 that it has a tail.  Wow.  That is something. 
[01:58:00]  Jim Gaffigan has left the building, ladies and gentlemen.  I need some Wellbutrin.  Yeah.  Jim's a parent.  I mean, it's different when you're a parent.  That is true.  None of us are parents.  Right.  We don't have children.  And we will never have children.  We're souls.  If we had children, it would be an awful thing because, you know, the Lord would be hovering  there right at the delivery and just fuck it up.  You'd just zap a few of those crumbs.  Oh, awful.  You think it's funny?  Say hello to your armless, fucked up face, burnt kid. 
[01:58:30]  That fat face.  Ron and Fez on XM 202.  Ron and Fez here, and our show is coming to XM 202 starting Monday, September 12th.  Just in time for back to school.

[02:00:00]  Another first down.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show, tip of the day on XM Radio.  Joe from New York City writes,  Tom, how often should I have my wheels aligned?  Joe, have your wheels checked or aligned every year or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first.  The alignment angles in your car's front end and rear end change as parts wear.  Poor road conditions, jostles the suspension, especially in New York City,  on cars with four-wheel independent suspension or front-wheel drive. 
[02:00:30]  Get a four-wheel alignment, and I'll tell you why.  Because these cars have adjustable angles at each wheel.  When the rear or front wheels get out of alignment, the tires want to track against each other.  This causes pulling, drifting, dog tracking, that's where the rear of the car tries to pass the front,  and excessive tire wear.  You might want to work into the regimen a tire rotation and rebalance every 6,000 miles.  Got a question?  Check our website at americascarshow.com.  Hear the full show on XM Channel 166, Saturdays, 2 p.m. Eastern. 
[02:01:00]  Hey, everybody, this is Travis Tritt, and you're listening to the worst, and I do mean the worst, of Opie and Anthony.  Hi, guys, you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I'm Jim Norton, a member of the show, and I'm here with Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  That's Anthony.  Hi, Jimmy.  And there's Opie.  One of my favorite parts of the show is when you go after callers.  You know, it's funny, and sometimes there's one right now.  Opie's phone's ringing.  Ring, ring, ring, ring. 
[02:01:30]  Banana phone.  L-O-L.  Boy, you couldn't pay for timing like that.  Yeah, this caller one time.  That call, by the way, came to Opie weeks ago.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, by the way, that's not happening right now.  Of course not.  Right now, Opie is having his fucking reddish ball bag licked somewhere on an island by a starving person.  For $3.  He's got his balls pressed against a fence, and there's an indigenous starving person licking his red bag. 
[02:02:00]  They've never seen a white one before.  Well, you just shut up.  This is when you went after a caller who happened to have a cleft palate.  Yes, which really does irritate me on every level.  Of course.  So put on your laughing hats.  What's on?  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Brian, what's up?  It's Brad, Opie.  What is it?  How you doing, man?  Brionno?  Brad?  What is your name?  Brad.  B-R-A-D?  Yeah.  Brad. 
[02:02:30]  Brad.  I'm crippled with a high palate.  You have a cleft palate?  Yeah.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Do you have an awful, like, Dave wants that mustache to not hide it?  Ask you, Norton.  Would I?  Would I?  You have a...  Hair lip!  Hair lip!  Ha ha!  Do you really have a cleft palate?  Yeah.  So what...  Why are you getting mad at me for just teasing it?  I know you probably have, like, a thick, awful mustache, which has, like, a scar in the  middle of it, because all cleft palate mustaches...  Like Cheech?  ...have that lightning strike in the middle?  What did this guy do to you? 
[02:03:00]  I don't know what to guess.  He called up saying, I have a cleft palate.  What am I supposed to do, pretend it's kissable?  Is it all fixed?  No, no.  Wait a minute.  You didn't...  You never got it fixed?  Well, I don't have straight teeth and stuff, but it's not...  No, it's not fixed.  Do you know what would help that?  If you put one end of a shotgun on it, and your toe on the other end...  That's so bad.  Blow that bad lip off and have them put some wax ones on there.  Anyways, I want to put what I learned today.  All right.  What did you learn?  I learned nothing, because it's too effing early over here.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you're in Sacramento.  It's very early.  Okay, very good.  Thanks, Brian.  I'm sorry I teased your freakishly misshapen lips, sir. 
[02:03:30]  Make sure you listen to the replay.  That's going to start in, like, ten minutes, I think.  I'm sure nobody notices when you're face down in the pillow.  Holy shit.  You don't even know this guy.  Why would he mention that he had a cleft palate?  Yeah, that isn't something you just bring up in conversation.  I could kind of hear it, because cleft palate people always talk.  They're just trying to hang on and talk properly, because half of their gums are hanging out.  There goes the cleft palate audience that we were trying to get.  We're losing the cleft palate audience.  I don't want you and your fucking horse gums listening.  You'll never work with Joaquin Phoenix for as long as you live.  That's right. 
[02:04:00]  And the other one, what's his name?  Kareeb.  What's his name?  Stacy Keach.  Stacy Keach.  There's another one.  And Cheech.  Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, killer cane.  Stacy Keach.  Stacy Keach.  I didn't know Joaquin Phoenix had that.  Oh, yeah, you can tell.  So he was yelling, help, help, while his brother was breakdancing in front of the Viper a few years ago.  Fucking faggot name.  It's a J, not a Y.  Hey, Joaquin.  Why are you so... 
[02:04:30]  Help, help, help.  Why are you so worked up today?  V-lip motherfucker.  Because I'm tired and my nose is stuffed.  Help.  Help.  Help.  He can't breathe.  Help.  Me'll take a straight dance.  You're going after the easy targets today.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  How can you not?  Everyone in Pittsburgh has a cleft palate.  Awful city.  I had nine people on every show with a fucking improv. 
[02:05:00]  I didn't know this was a touchy subject with you.  How can it not be?  Because if he's a cleft palate, we're supposed to go, hey, you're brave, facing your injury.  Wow.  You know what you should do if you have a cleft palate?  Move to Alaska, because it's night for half the year, and people won't see it.  Jesus Christ.  I got to build an igloo.  I live in that.  Ugh.  Awful.  What would you do if you brought home a girl, and she had a cleft pussy lip? 
[02:05:30]  You'd punch her in the stomach and kick her out.  You wouldn't talk to her like she was an igloo?  Ugh.  Stupid knife slash on the face lip.  Fuck off.  He's hurting me.  He's hurting me.  Oh, boy.  Imagine having to kiss that.  Like, this is a kiss.  But his kiss is probably this.  Like that fucking half an awful kiss.  Can I make out with the right side of the left tonight? 
[02:06:00]  Holy ass.  Oh, that's got to be awful.  Who punched you, son?  Oh, nobody!  I was born this way!  Ugh.  I'm sweating.  Where does this come from?  Always have to be careful you don't make B or P sounds, because they go like this.  I'm a good boy.  I'm a good boy.  You're a good boy.  What is that?  Where does this come from?  What?  He really has a cleft palate problem.  I've known you for a long time.  Where did I just think of a cleft palate? 
[02:06:30]  I saw a guy.  It was at a Starbucks.  I was buying coffee one time.  Starbucks?  Yeah, Starbucks.  He wanted a nice, nice, nice.  I want anything, as long as you don't speak.  Just nod.  Just nod.  If you have a cleft palate, where you should be is a bank robber, because it's acceptable  to put a bandana across the lower half of your face.  Bank robber in the 1800s?  That should be your perfective choice.  Oh, wow.  You know what they should say? 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  This should be every bit of dialogue in a hospital.  Mr. and Mrs. fill in name here.  Your boy slash girl was born with a cleft palate, and the parents should respond, so how did  you euthanize it?  Wow.  Not to break it up.  Look at Ozzy's daughter's tits. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, my God.  Is that Kelly?  Wow.  Kelly Osbourne's tits are good.  Those are fat tits, though.  They're fat tits.  Yeah.  But that's, you know, she still has youth with her, so it's okay.  Not really, man.  She has a good eight inches of cleavage.  Yeah, but she's wearing the low cut, so you're not paying attention to how awful the rest of  her body is.  Yeah, but look at the cleavage behind Ben's head.  Anyone else notice that only the fat girls dye their hair like that?  No, you want to take the attention off of the body.  Exactly.  Fat girls like to dye their hair crazy colors so you don't notice how fat they are. 
[02:08:00]  So, she's got such a cute face.  That's not a bad suggestion.  So, by the way...  Those are nice.  Those are nice, though.  Ugh.  Nord, how much would you love to bang her just to say you banged her?  I would love to, but I also want to throw out the suggestion.  I don't want to say the name again, but if you're one of these people walking around with  an unpleasant split lip, dye yourself from the neck down a color like pink or yellow so people  don't look at you above the shoulders. 
[02:08:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, another one going way back, huh?  Remember the drill-do?  That was...  You can see.  The drill-do bit, we don't even have to explain this one.  This is self-explanetary.  Self-explanetary.  Yes.  No, this is, yeah, a girl getting worked over by a dildo on the end of a drill, sure. 
[02:09:00]  Hence, drill-do.  Right.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  So, Steve, you got the thing there?  Yeah.  Okay.  I got about four minutes of audio.  We should set this up.  We're trying to get the gay out.  Yeah, the past few days, we've been talking a lot about guys, and some sexual conversation  has come up, and it usually turns into the gay zone.  Yeah.  We don't mind our good buddies out there, but... 
[02:09:30]  We want chicks.  We want chicks in the studio.  We want the sounds of chicks.  That's what this satellite radio is all about.  Girls.  Oh, we're clever and intelligent, but no one cares about that crap.  Bring on the girls.  We'll give you a taste of that from time to time, but it's all about moaning.  Right.  Something you just can't do on regular radio anymore.  No, not allowed.  And other jocks, very excited to be able to do that in 15 months.  We get to do it now.  Now.  While they play their commercials. 
[02:10:00]  Now.  Now.  Now.  Now.  And supposedly that girl's coming in to do the wiffle ball bat challenge.  Did she get...  You got her the address here and everything?  Yeah?  Yeah, no.  Nodding really works on radio.  No, I know.  Nodding's usually an indication of a positive response, if you ask a question.  Do we have lube?  Do we have lubricant for that?  We might have to...  I don't know what that is.  It looks like hand lotion.  I don't think girls like hand lotion being put down there.  Luckily, here in New York, there are places that are open 24 hours to carry that stuff. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah, you can just grab some KY or something.  All right.  And we got the rubbers.  Where are all the condoms?  Condoms.  We got the plastic gloves.  There's a big box of them.  They were in the office.  That was the first present someone sent us.  All right.  So.  So why don't we set this up?  Because we've just been babbling like idiots for the last 20 minutes.  Steve, what's this?  What is this audio?  This is audio that one of our fans sent to me.  It's...  Shut up.  Please.  What happened, Steve?  No, they're just talking and it's distracting. 
[02:11:00]  That's all.  WD-40 is holding up.  No, we can't use...  Oh, WD-40.  Oh.  We can't use WD-40 on the wiffle ball bat.  Not that it'll affect the girl or anything.  It'll just take the marker marks off so we won't know where it ends up.  Opie has a cold.  Oh.  I can sneeze on the bat.  I can let some phlegm loose on the thing.  All right.  Go ahead, Steve.  Set this bit up.  Like a radio professional.  All right.  This is audio about...  It was sent to me maybe three months ago as potential material for the show, and I listened  to it maybe for the first time a week ago. 
[02:11:30]  It is a girl who is being violated with a Makita drill that has a dildo strapped to the end of it.  A dildo on a cordless drill?  Yeah.  And a girl, is she enjoying it from the sounds of the end?  Well, she's either enjoying it or she said these are her last final breaths.  Really?  Yeah.  I like when girls sound like that.  That's good.  Very, very nice.  Very good.  All right.  This is what satellite radio is all about right here.  Because you can't do it on regular radio.  All right.  Let's take a listen to this. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, God.  Here.  I want the drill.  Oh, please.  Should I turn it on?  Here.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I want the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  What did I just do to you? 
[02:12:30]  You treated me like a whore.  How did I do that?  Put your shoes on the trail on me.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Oh, fuck me with it.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck me.  Oh, my God.  Don't stop treating me like a whore. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, please.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  Oh, no.  Oh, please.  Please fuck me. 
[02:14:00]  Please fuck me.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I think you don't do today.  No, please.  No.  Please.  Just a little more.  Just a drill on me a little more.  A drill?  Yeah, just a little more.  I think you don't want the drill.  No.  I want the drill.  Please.  Yeah.  Only one orgasm?  Oh, yeah.  You promise?  Uh-huh.  I promise.  Oh, God. 
[02:14:30]  Tell me when to turn it on.  Oh, God.  Turn it on, please.  Oh, God.  Full.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I think the room was open.  Are they?  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  You're stuck on my palm.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God. 
[02:16:00]  No, no, please.  I want you to come with me.  Fine.  Holy S.  Is this legal?  This studio is clean.  I think we just got the gay out.  Oh, my God.  Holy S.  Man, I don't even know what to say to that. 
[02:16:30]  You should have to do that.  No, I am offended.  I'm on the side of the FCC.  We need to be stopped.  Wow.  Somebody's asking if they used a regular drill bit on that drill.  I am stupefied.  But everyone's happy again.  Look, everyone has smiles on their faces in here now.  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:00]  Jared from Boston.  Today I learned that my mother thinks the drill bit is very inappropriate,  even for my age, and I'm 23.  Well, we warned you.  You've got to turn down the radio so you don't get in trouble.  Frank from Virginia says the gay is gone.  Yes, it is.  So you've got to have confidence in us, people.  I'm a whore.  A whore.  You have a whore living in your building.  She's a whore.  She's a whore. 
[02:17:30]  There you go, Howard.  That's something you'll be able to do in 15 months.  Keep talking about Bush and how he hates you.  Shut up.  And actually, that was our first commercial break for Makita Drills.  Yes.  Makita, the workman's friend.  Welcome to the program.  Welcome, Makita.  Why wait 15 months when you can get it now?  Man, I don't even know what to say after that.  All they needed was a little duct tape over her mouth, is what someone's saying here.  But no, that was something. 
[02:18:00]  She was loud.  Jeremy.  Screaming.  What's up, Jeremy?  How you guys doing?  You know, I tried the same thing with the Makita bandsaw, and it's completely different.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Saw her leg off.  All right.  All right, boys.  Catch you later.  Thanks, Jeremy.  Let's go to David in Oklahoma.  What's up, David?  Not much.  You guys rock, man.  I'm going to have to go home and go buy a drone now so I can call out my wife.  That was awesome.  Can you imagine all the people that decided to wait to turn on their XM satellite radios 
[02:18:30]  for this weekend?  You've got to be kidding.  You got that, bro.  The reason we got this XM, I'm a truck driver also.  We just got it about three weeks before you guys came on the radio.  That's the only reason we got it.  Nice.  That's cool.  Thank you.  All righty.  All right.  Spread the O&A virus for us, all right?  I will.  All right.  Let's go to Justin in Columbus, Ohio.  We used to be on in Columbus, Ohio at the Big Wazoo.  Remember that?  Yeah, the Wazoo.  That's why I used to listen to you guys. 
[02:19:00]  I just wanted to tell you guys that I'm listening.  I'm spreading the virus down here in Columbus.  Oh, cool, bro.  I got about five guys to just sign up for you guys.  There you go.  That's how it builds, man.  Ordered my Wow stickers.  That should be the commercial right there.  Yeah.  This is what you get on the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm a whore.  I'm a whore.  No one cares about us talking about how there's no freedom in America anymore.  That's what they want.  Bring on the whore.  Bring on the hope.  Dave from Redding, Pennsylvania. 
[02:19:30]  Now everyone in my office thinks I'm listening to a murder.  Did kind of sound like she was in pain, didn't it?  Yeah.  But she was digging it.  John in Jersey.  What's up, John?  Yeah, you just woke up my entire office floor.  I think I'm getting cans today.  Hey, John, this sounds just like our old show, right?  This is pretty much exactly like it.  Yeah.  Was that real audio?  Yes, it was.  No, was that real audio of two nights ago at Norton's apartment?  There you go.  Is that what that was?  Hey, you guys suck.  Thanks.  All right, buddy.  Thank you, whore.  Hey, we got the guy that's.  There's a whore living in your building. 
[02:20:00]  Robification.  That was you in that audio?  That was me.  Oh, my God.  Stop.  A Wackbag member?  Yes, I am.  Wackbag.com?  And who is the other person in there?  Well, she's my ex-girlfriend.  Ex-girlfriend?  She's my ex-girlfriend.  We recorded this, what, maybe two years after we broke up.  On video?  Well, there's video coming.  Wait, wait.  Do you videotape that?  No, we're going to.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe that was audio from a video.  Wait, she's your ex-girlfriend, but you guys get together to do this thing every once in a while? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, well, you know.  Man, she's a good egg.  Man, I went down and, you know.  That's a good girl.  What a good egg.  What were you recording it into then?  Just a tape recorder?  No, well, the, um, well, no, she had headphones on.  We had, oh, excuse me.  I had her hooked up to my computer.  Oh, so you recorded right into a computer.  And what, you, you, did you make the little thing, the dildo on a drill bit?  Yeah, I took a Makita drill.  Yeah.  And, uh, congratulations on your first, um. 
[02:21:00]  Our little sponsor, Makita.  And what, you just threw it on into the chuck?  Well, yeah, uh, I cut a little hole in the back of the dildo.  It was like an eight-inch long.  The thing was sick, though.  It was unbelievable.  Yeah.  And I stuffed it on there, and I couldn't believe she liked it.  How fast did you get it going?  Oh, I had a full speed.  Full speed.  Full speed.  And that's when she was screaming her head off.  Dude, my windows were open.  I can't believe the cops didn't come to my door.  How, what does she look like?  Um.  And what does it look like down there now?  Is it all twisted in a knot? 
[02:21:30]  Oh, God.  All beat up and twisted.  No, she's all right.  Yeah?  She's all right.  She's really not into the pain thing, so I, I was really shocked.  I don't know.  I'll send you a picture of her.  Yeah, yeah, you gotta send a picture, because we gotta know what she looks like.  She got that annoying accent.  Oh, I've been hearing that a lot.  Ah, my whore.  A whore.  Matter of fact, after we, um, after we were done, she, um, she herself said, 
[02:22:00]  I can't believe how bad my accent is.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah, because that's what everybody was paying attention to, her accent.  Not her screaming.  Did you fulfill her wish at the end of that audio?  Oh, what, coming out of the face?  On her face, yeah.  Oh, I always do.  All right, thanks, buddy.  You guys have a good one.  All right.  All right.  Totally hooking us up today.  I don't even know if that's legal, but, uh, George from Philly.  Okay, now I gotta stay at my desk for a while.  Keith in South Jersey.  I wonder how that sounded outside my van, parked in the middle of this used car lot. 
[02:22:30]  Parachute rigger Rob.  Dude, my wife's sleeping in the other room, and I have no idea how I'm gonna explain this  to her.  Adam from Rochester.  Hey, a-holes, you're gonna get me fired.  Make the whore shut the hell up.  Chris from Boston.  Hey, guys, where did you get the audio of Martha Stewart's first night in prison?  Good one.  Oh, that is a good one.  Uh, what else do we got here?  John, this sounds like outtakes from my cousin Vinny.  Huh?  I don't get that one. 
[02:23:00]  See, maybe I should proofread.  Dan from Ohio.  For the love of God, put that up on Foundry.  Can we put that up on foundrymusic.com?  Yeah, absolutely.  We can do that.  That is a great one.  And there'll be a link on opiananthony.com?  Absolutely.  Also, uh, by going through opiananthony.com, you can now get your wow stickers.  And, uh, Sean C. from work says,  Jesus Christ, guys, I work at a school, and my finger's on the volume control during the whole show.  So, yeah, you gotta watch.  We warn you guys before we do, before we test the limits of the satellite radio. 
[02:23:30]  That's today's test.  One a day, I think.  And VirusJunk says,  Yo, B, it sounds like someone was throwing a tray up in that.  In that piece.  Up in that piece.  The opianthony program.  Or that stupid XM stinger they do.  What is it?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  XM 202.  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  Introducing Wow for Dummies.

You feel like showing us a little something-something.  Rip them out Wednesday.  The Technophile.  Hi, I'm Lazlo.  Technology fads are inescapable.  One minute all you hear about is internet radio, then it's podcasting, followed up by online poker. 
[02:24:30]  The poker craze has inspired several poker nerds to write software that tells them the best way to bet.  Counting cards in a real casino will get you tossed out.  But poker bots are being used to prey on newcomers, help with strategy, and in the end, make money.  It's bad enough that the 25-year-old blonde that you're chatting with is probably a fat guy just out of prison.  Now you could be playing poker against a computer and not even know it. 
[02:25:00]  Some say that poker players are being paranoid,  and the software needed for the intricate process of reading other cards, bluffing, and folding is years away.  But in the end, if you're up at midnight betting away your paycheck,  whether you're playing against man or machine, it's called gambling for a reason.  I'm Lazlow.com.  That's what's on my underground hard drive.  High Voltage is an XL channel which may include explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by contacting XM Listener Care at 1-800-XM-RADIO. 
[02:25:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, this is Jamie Heinemann.  And this is Adam Savage.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Endorsed by Mythbusters.  The only way you're getting a date is with a bottle of chloroform.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Rob checking in from Florida on the instant feedback. 
[02:26:00]  Anthony says, dude, the Tara Reade's boo picture is up already on opieandanthony.com.  Hey, there we go.  Maybe I should look at opieandanthony.com more often.  Now, suffice to say, if I was to pay for it, it would have to be a young, hot chick.  You know? 
[02:26:30]  What are you talking about?  Oh, a little discussion we were having during commercials.  Yeah, Norton saves his best stuff when we go to break.  And then I have to look at him and I'm like, why aren't you talking about this on the air?  He went to Sacramento.  He's a successful touring comic when he's not doing the Opie and Anthony Show.  He pretty much goes somewhere every weekend.  He was in Sacramento and he had three sold-out shows.  The fourth show was pretty much sold out as well.  And all the fans were there and everyone's saying he killed.  And then he went back to Adam and Ariel's house, the couple that is in the lead as Sexiest State in America. 
[02:27:00]  Which there is a controversy on that, but we'll get to that in a second.  And he went back to their apartment just to meet their creepy friend, Ed.  And I mean, these people think you're a rock star when you're not on stage, bro.  They know I'm an ass.  And then what did you get?  You got a massage?  Last night before I flew home.  Now this is a prime example of somebody who does this so much, who pays for women's company so much that it's nothing special anymore. 
[02:27:30]  It's nothing you look forward to like somebody who never does it and would really go through the shopping process and make sure you're paying for the best thing you could possibly get.  Like, I've never paid for it.  I couldn't bring myself to do it.  It's something I just...  Why are you looking at us in shock?  I know.  All weird.  I almost...  I, in recent history, have stopped girls from giving me Hummers because I had one I wanted to pay for later that night.  I'd rather pay for it.  Isn't that odd?  Why would you rather pay for it?  I don't know. 
[02:28:00]  It's just the way he is.  It's part of the dirty factor.  I don't know, man.  You're just feeling like extra naughty.  Probably.  I just like the idea of it.  Like, here's the cash.  Blah, blah, blah.  You know, there's just something about that exchange.  That is saying something about yourself.  Like groupie or something, let's say?  No, no.  I'm not an idiot.  I mean, I'm not going to blow off a nine just to pick up a seven or a six for money.  I'll tell you what it is.  I'll do a little psychoanalysis here.  Jimmy is so self-hating that he feels...  He's not worthy?  He has to pay for it. 
[02:28:30]  Like he's not worthy and he has to pay for it.  He shouldn't be getting it for free.  Right.  Like the girl has to get some type of compensation for doing stuff to him.  You know, it's because I hate my fat tits.  So whenever I'm paying for it, I don't care that they're dangling.  Right.  I'm like, I'd play out my nipples.  Now he'd be self-conscious if the girl's doing this for free.  He's a little more self-conscious about what's going on.  If he's paying, it's like, screw you, bitch.  I'm paying you.  That's why you're here with me.  Yeah, exactly.  We all know this is honest.  It's going to be awful for you.  Just play with my nipples.  We'll both dissociate and get through it. 
[02:29:00]  So now if I was paying for it, it would be...  I would shop around to find the best, hottest chick for the money I was paying.  Well, sometimes it's not...  You know, Jim and I have discussed this.  Sometimes it's not about the hotness of a chick.  What is it about?  Sometimes the slobs, you know, try a little harder, give you a little extra, and that's  kind of a turn-on, too.  Well, Jimmy, what did you have?  Well, I was in Sacramento.  I said, you know what?  I'm flying home in a couple hours.  Why not get a massage?  Relax myself a little bit.  Relax a little. 
[02:29:30]  That's good on the air.  Coughing creep.  But it's not about the massage.  Well, no.  It's about the end of the massage.  Right.  And this girl was $100, and I went to her online.  Girl.  Stop saying girl.  All right, this 49-year-old...  49-year-old woman he's paying for.  And how did you know she was 49?  Well, I looked at her online.  She looked good, and there was a picture of her hiney up in the air, and the thong was  barely covering, you know, so she looked like she really had, like, a nice little hot dog  pack down there, which I like, a nice big lip, so I'm like, all right, this is the girl  for me.  She comes over.  She gets lost. 
[02:30:00]  She comes in and has that old lady reek of cigarettes.  You know that old lady...  Oh, my God, no.  Do you know the old lady cigarette smell?  Yeah.  It's in their hair.  She looked good in the picture.  What was a brand new AMC pacer behind her?  Her fingernails were all yellow from all the smoke, and she does...  Oh, dude, she had on, like, brown...  What do you want, honey?  She had slacks on.  They were, like, mom slacks.  Slacks!  Brown mom slacks. 
[02:30:30]  And she had a bunt, and her breasts were kind of, like, awful.  I'm 50 years old!  I'm 50 years old!  Don't I look good?  I'm 50 years old!  100 bucks.  I'm like, all right.  100 bucks.  So I lay down on my stomach, and she starts giving me the massage, and she strips down  to the thong, but it didn't...  Here's what...  Like, you ever see somebody with a bunt put a thong on?  They pull the thong up high, so the thong comes all the way up to almost their belly  button, and it's covering their bunt.  Oh, no! 
[02:31:00]  That is horrible, man.  And she had a dark tattoo of a flower right by her crotch, but it was almost like an old  sailor tattoo.  It was like an old guy, his arm was all, like, black and blue-ed, it looks like.  Ozzy's knuckle color, like the Ozzy on his knuckle, like that type of color.  It's lost any brightness to it whatsoever.  It was awful, and I'm looking at it, and I can kind of see the lips, and I'm like, I'm  getting turned on.  And she's like, yeah, not bad for a grandmother.  And I was like...  Oh!  No way!  Swear to God.  Not bad for a grandmother. 
[02:31:30]  How did you know she was 49?  She told me.  No, that means she's older than 49.  Who are you kidding?  You know, you're probably right.  You're probably right.  You gotta add a minimum of five years onto that.  She's probably 53, 54 years old.  She probably was, yeah, 53, 54.  It was 100 bucks.  Wow, too.  Especially if she says 49.  That is really, really heinous.  Well, she was massaging me, and I don't know why, she's like, do you want to massage me?  And her ass looked like two lima beans.  It was long and flat.  But I massaged it anyway, and I was trying to, like, peek between the legs. 
[02:32:00]  And then...  Why?  I don't know.  See, now I'm with Anthony.  Now, at this point, I'm out.  I had to get out.  I had to get on a plane.  I had a full rod, and I'm like, I was trying to get her to, you know, drink from the mule.  And she's like, oh, I don't know.  Did you hug her after she got out of the bathtub and then run out of the room?  Dude, that's exactly...  I wrote about her, and that's exactly who I referenced her as.  Did she claw at Danny's sweater?  That's exactly who she reminded me of.  I think we better take Danny to a doctor. 
[02:32:30]  When do you think maybe we should take Danny to an escort?  Oh, that's horrible.  Awful.  Oh, lima bean ass.  Oh, that's brutal.  She was topless, too, you said?  Well, she told me, I was playing with my nipples.  I'm like, I just like, like sometimes when the girls rub me, I'll lay on my back, and  like a praying mantis, I just diddle my nipples, and it's just completely disconnected from  any human contact while she does what she does to my mule. 
[02:33:00]  And she's like, my nipples are sensitive, too.  And she pops them out, and they were like...  Oh, man.  They were brutal.  Yeah, dragging on the ground all day, they would be sensitive.  Little Pinocchio noses.  But I did toy with them, and she's like, I like both...  She wanted me to toy with them with both hands, because I think she just didn't want  me touching other body parts, which I wouldn't have anyway.  Yeah.  Oh, I almost forgot the best part.  So I'm playing with her nipples, but meanwhile, I want to play with mine.  So I try to, like, you know, pull her thong aside, and she's like, well, I don't  know, I have a tampon in.  So I pull it aside.  Oh, my God! 
[02:33:30]  I swear to God.  She did not.  She's been through menopause.  And she pulled it aside, and there was a string.  I just wanted to see the lips, and there was a string.  It was awful.  It was disgusting.  She gave pretty good hummer, though.  She gave pretty good hummer.  Of course.  She's had a lot of practice, many years.  Yeah.  I forgot the tamp.  Oh, my God.  She uses the old 60s technique that she learned, I'm sure.  The old hippie bitch technique. 
[02:34:00]  So did she whack you off?  Yeah, well, she drank.  Her arthritic hand.  She drank it, huh?  Well, she didn't drink it, but, I mean, she, you know, she was, uh.  It's good for my osteoporosis.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Just singing all the right things there, honey.  How you doing tonight, darling?  You thought you were going to get action from Ariel, one half of the sexiest couple in America,  and you end up with a grandma.  I thought at least I'd get to watch Ariel.  Nice weekend.  I stink.  That's my life, dude.  That's what my life is. 
[02:34:30]  I hang out with the hot chick, and then the guy, I'm like, all right, cool, man.  I get to watch him bang, and I wind up with a grandmother with a tampon.  She's wearing a locket with her grandkids' pictures in it.  Well, what, I get one of those old lady bracelets that has the little grandchild heads around it.  The grandchildren little trinkets around it.  The charm bracelet.  Yeah, charm bracelet.  Then she just took her money and left.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she had a candle she brought with her.  My youngest just got out of college.  Dude, that's awful.  That is a really awful story, and you paid for it. 
[02:35:00]  How much total?  Usually I enjoy your stories, but...  190?  Well, 100, because it was late.  She had a driver, so it was 120, and I tipped her 70 for the Hummer.  I probably could have gotten it from 50.  A driver was probably one of our grandkids.  Ugh.  That is despicable.  She had a driver?  Yeah, they always do.  It's for safety.  Yeah, safety.  I'd fall and break her hip.  Driving Miss Daisy.  Driving Miss Daisy.  All of a sudden, I'm banging her, and I inadvertently hit her life call, and the ambulance came.  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Driving Miss Daisy.  Yeah, driving Miss Daisy. 
[02:35:30]  I'm just trying to drive you to Jim Norton.  That is really heinous.  It was bad.  Is that the oldest broad you've been with?  How old is the oldest gal you've been with, Jimmy?  Probably in that area.  I don't mess with older women.  I don't acknowledge them.  Obviously, you don't.  Aside from very recently.  Very rarely.  Very rarely.  She was 20 years older than you.  I don't have that fetish.  At all.  I don't have that fetish.  It's not only not a fetish.  It is something to repulse you.  I'll agree.  You can not have a fetish to something, but still, you know, if it comes your way, take it. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  That is somewhere I dare not venture.  I assume, you know, God willing, and the river don't rise, there'll be plenty of time to bang old broads.  Yeah.  You know?  She was awful.  You do it now, it's...  I don't see any...  I paid for it.  I don't see anything sexy about that.  I don't either.  It was awful.  That is a horrific story out of The Shining.  I just started hugging her, and she looked really good, and then I just pulled back, and when she started laughing, I looked at her back. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, hot.  Speaking of old broads, there's a 57-year-old lady in the paper that's going to have twins, Anthony.  Yeah.  How do they make this one work?  I mean, is it a natural child thing happening here, or did she have some...  It's probably the drugs.  They give them all kinds of drugs.  Let me see this.  Because these selfish whores want to be mothers.  Yep.  This selfish whore.  I always knew I wanted children.  I wanted children at 57 years old, career gal, is now ready to start a family. 
[02:37:00]  Career gal.  That's it right there, by the way.  Face it.  You have reached the second plateau.  It's over.  Now it's just selfish.  Alita St. James is expecting the best gift of her life for her 57th birthday this week.  Newborn twins.  St. James, a motivational speaker, and the eldest sister of guardian angel leader Curtis Lewa.  Did you read that?  I didn't know that.  She's the sister?  Yeah, is set to shatter conventional limitations of childbirth tomorrow when she is slated  to deliver a baby boy and girl at Mount Sinai Hospital just three days shy of her birthday. 
[02:37:30]  Oh.  That kid's been in a womb that's probably like leather.  All dried up like a saddle.  Like saddle leather.  Oh, she conceived through in vitro fertilization, and she will become the oldest American woman  to give birth to twins.  What an a...  Oh.  You want your career?  Have your career.  You want a career?  Have a career.  You want to be a mom?  Be a mom.  Make a decision.  Do you know how awful it's going to be for that kid?  What's she, 57?  57.  Picture 13 years old. 
[02:38:00]  You've got to take your mom to the PTA or the parent-teacher conference, and a 70-year-old  mother comes in the door.  70.  If you're still alive at all.  Your kid's 13.  You're 70.  You know the other kids are going to be making fun of you, and it's going to crush the poor  little kid.  Yep.  Here comes old grandma.  Here comes old grandma.  Old droopy-titted mom coming in.  And there you are.  There you are bringing your mom in, probably on a, maybe even a walker. 
[02:38:30]  She'll have a walker coming into school.  And then there's the other hot moms from the other kids.  Your child will be jealous of the hot mom.  Well, yeah, I mean, 57's not that old.  You know, it really isn't.  Yes, it is.  Well, no.  I mean, she's looking at this like, yeah, I'm 57, I can handle this.  But, you know, a quick 10 years go by, and like what Anthony's talking about here, then  it's a whole other game.  I had the hot mom in school.  You were the one with the hot mom?  I was the one with the hot mom.  And my mom dressed like a slut. 
[02:39:00]  She had a, she would, I used to like whine and cry for her to be one of the field trip  mothers.  You know, the mothers that go along on the field trips?  Because my friends would just, they were flabbergasted.  She would dress like in, in white knee-high go-go boots, put pigtails in her hair, halter  tops and shorts.  And she's on the bus and like, you know.  That's how she was dressed this summer for that party.  Yeah, of course.  She does that.  For your sister.  65 years old or whatever she is.  She's still doing that. 
[02:39:30]  She is very solid.  I met her once.  Aunt's mom is still hot.  Very solid.  She's a gym rat.  Your mom is smoking, man.  She's an animal.  But back, but, sorry.  Back then, when she was, you know, she was in her mid-twenties, I guess.  When, when, or mid to late, mid to late twenties.  You had a young mom growing up, right?  And she was the hot, you know, she was hot.  I had the hot mom.  And it was cool because, you know, all my friends and stuff would be like, oh, your mom  is so pretty and everything.  And it was kind of, you know, something to be proud of.  And this woman is going to be the laughing stock. 
[02:40:00]  She's going to make her kid the laughing stock.  You know how embarrassing it is?  I knew kids that had, like, really old parents.  It's embarrassing for the kid.  She can't do anything.  Go to a parent, uh, a parent student, like, outing.  One of those things.  And she's going to be sitting there, nodding off with oxygen and a walker, bedpan under  her.  Ugh.  She'll be 75 when her kids, uh, graduate high school.  It's selfish. 
[02:40:30]  75.  Look at Tony Randall, that old bastard.  Had those kids and then drops dead.  And all those people were applauding like, oh, good for you.  That's great, Tony.  Good for you.  You know, he wants to be a dad to a little kid.  And those kids are now, what, five, six years old, and they don't understand why daddy's  dead already?  We'll never know the father.  What a selfish, selfish thing to do.  Eesh.  All right.  Should adopt a kid, at least.  Yeah, adopt some mongoloid.  Yeah, take in a little black boy or something and touch its smooth skin. 
[02:41:00]  Well, she says something about the adoption thing here.  Oh, she does.  The reason that I wanted to carry these children rather than adopting them is that I knew that  I could give them, while they were in the uterus, a tremendous amount of love, a tremendous  amount of support.  I wanted to give them that start.  Oh.  I don't think of myself with a number.  I don't think, oh, I'm going to be 60.  I think I'm going to take these kids to school, she added.  Yeah.  Sure.  Sure.  You probably got to sew the thing up like one of those turkeys after you put the stuffing  just to hold the kid in for term. 
[02:41:30]  I'm ready.  Ready to fall out with her uterus.  I'm ready, she said, with great determination, resting her swollen frame against the living  room wall.  Ugh.  Oh, man.  You kind of like that, though, don't you?  Because you like pregnant and you like him older, too.  No, this is...  I hope he digs the older chick.  Oh, he does.  He's a weirdo.  He's a weirdo.  I like the...  I have an older woman fetish, but that was when I was younger.  Now that's a problem.  I got to get rid of that fetish because, ugh, you know, we're getting up there now.  So now for that fetish to happen, I got to be into, like, I don't know, 50-year-olds. 
[02:42:00]  Never liked older women.  I'm talking when I was, like, 18, 19, 20, and I saw the mothers in their, like, early  30s.  That was a major turn-on.  Even as high as 40.  Yeah.  So I got to get rid of that fetish, obviously.  Yeah, let's see.  The canal looks like the Indiana Jones ride at Disney.  Kid will come toppling out of there, big boulder chasing them.  Hey, Bill, what's up?  Bill, you still there?  Hey.  Yeah.  All right, let's go.  Hello, Bill.  I teach kindergarten in a Philly suburb. 
[02:42:30]  Philly?  How about those eagles?  How about those eagles?  Well, uh...  Whatever.  Go ahead.  We got old bags coming through there like you wouldn't believe, man.  In kindergarten, huh?  I had a mom last year.  She retired while her kid was in kindergarten, and she still had a three-year-old.  But what they do is they do their careers, and they get a bunch of money, and then they  get a nanny to come and take care of the kid.  And they take the kid out for a little while for, like, a walk or something.  Well, you know, it's definitely...  And the nanny does all the heavy lifting.  It's definitely the new thing. 
[02:43:00]  People are having kids a lot later in life, but...  It's the drugs.  They're able to do that in vitro.  They're able to give them drugs, and they can have these kids out of their selfish...  for these selfish reasons.  Well, that's the problem.  That's why this 57-year-old bag is having twins.  I've seen old bags with triplets.  And, man, they don't have the energy to take care of those kids.  Of course they don't.  They don't have the energy to take care of them or to do what's necessary to, like, raise  a healthy kid.  Oh.  You want to be able to interact with your child, not be a mess sitting there in a chair 
[02:43:30]  because you can't go out there.  What a selfish thing to do.  Well, a lot of these women have this thing where it's so hip, and they think that any woman  that wants to be a mother is, like, a cornball or submissive to men.  She's like, oh, I want my career.  I'm not going to be a slave like that.  And then they realize that they're unfulfilled whores by the time they're 60.  And, like, gee, maybe being a mom wasn't such a degrading, awful thing.  Let me try doing that now.  Yeah, let me take a whack at it now at 60.  Yeah, that's it.  Because their career left them unfulfilled.  Yeah.  What, your two cars in the garage didn't quite bring you the satisfaction you thought it would? 
[02:44:00]  Your self-centered pigs?  I ran out of air.  I saw that.  I completely identify with that problem, Jim North.  Oh, I knew I was running out of air quick with that one.  I want to announce I'm going to be a father.  Your face turned red and everything.  I can't believe it.  I smell dead people.  I farted.  The O.D. and Anthony Show.  Surfing the net continues to simplify, but if you use search engines, there are a few tips you should know. 
[02:44:30]  Welcome into Tomorrow, I'm Dave Graveline.  Justin Osmer is a project manager for MSN, and he says you can make the search engines work for you.  If you put quotation marks around what you're looking for, that'll help you find it much more easily  and will give you back a result that exactly matches that term.  So, for example, if you're looking for an air conditioner, you put quotation marks around air conditioner,  you'll get results back that say that exact phrase rather than a bunch of results that may just be about air  and a bunch that may be about conditioner. 
[02:45:00]  Any innovations at MSN?  Well, something new that just launched this last week is the opportunity for a local search.  And at MSN.com, at the top of the search box there, you'll see a link to local search.  And what local search does is provide you with local information that has addresses and phone numbers coupled with a map.  Searching into tomorrow, I'm Dave Graveline at Graveline.com.  Hi, this is Tom Torbjornson with America's Car Show, tip of the day on XM Radio. 
[02:45:30]  Joe from New York City writes,  Tom, how often should I have my wheels aligned?  Joe, have your wheels checked or aligned every year or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first.  The alignment angles in your car's front end and rear end change as parts wear.  Poor road conditions, jostles the suspension, especially in New York City,  on cars with four-wheel independent suspension or front-wheel drive.  Get a four-wheel alignment, and I'll tell you why.  Because these cars have adjustable angles at each wheel.  When the rear or front wheels get out of alignment, the tires want to track against each other. 
[02:46:00]  This causes pulling, drifting, dog tracking, that's where the rear of the car tries to pass the front,  and excessive tire wear.  You might want to work into the regimen a tire rotation and rebalance every 6,000 miles.  Got a question? Check our website at americascarshow.com.  Hear the full show on XM Channel 166, Saturdays, 2 p.m. Eastern.  Hey, this is Terry Jones of Monty Barth, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:46:30]  Ramone, Ramone, put my stomach in your pocket.  We love the Ramone stuff, don't we, guys?  Yep, of course we do.  Steve, you know, Martini Steve, our production guy, he did this whole series of promos revolving around this imaginary guy, Ramone.  Ramone and his boss.  And his boss, who's the big voice guy that voices promo.  And apparently Steve has it all worked out. 
[02:47:00]  The relationship, everything, the way they look, where they live.  Much too many, too many details about these characters, made up in his little Steve head.  Let's learn about Ramone here.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Peroxide your hair and speak in an effeminate fashion.  Ramone. 
[02:47:30]  All right.  Fucking terrible.  Hear anybody says, I fucked Martini Steve in the mouth.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  What's up with you and your imaginary friend, Ramone?  He's not my imaginary friend.  He's just the...  Did you make him up?  Yeah, I did.  But he's yours.  He's my creation.  I'll certainly take credit for that. 
[02:48:00]  But Ramone is the byproduct of something I learned when I was working at NEW.  They told me that a lot of the deep voice guys that do voiceover for movies and for TV.  Oh, my God.  Check this out.  Listen, this is...  The explanation.  No, this is...  Here's the explanation.  This is exactly where it came from.  They do a lot of their voiceover work from home in a home studio on ISTN line.  And so a lot of them are just traipsing around home in their bathrobes or sweatpants, making millions of dollars, mind you, doing voice work. 
[02:48:30]  So you believe there's some guy walking around and his house boy is there.  And he has a house boy.  And as he's doing these voiceovers, sometimes things happen and he's got to go, Ramone...  Exactly.  ...clean his up.  So you feel like you're one of these big voice guys and you need a little house boy.  Oh, no, no, no.  That's why I pitch my voice down because I have to make it sound like it's not me.  Right.  So, yeah, exactly.  So not only does he have an imaginary friend named Ramone, he has an imaginary him.  Oh, this is not going well.  Did you just call from Jersey two minutes ago? 
[02:49:00]  What do you think?  You think way too much into this.  No, this is how you be...  I sit in a room with no windows, mind you, for hours on end.  So sometimes you're...  What's the profile of Ramone?  What kind of person is he?  Well, that's interesting.  Is he short?  Because I brought this up with Nathaniel and Danny yesterday and they each have a different visualization for what Ramone looks like.  Really?  All right, get those guys in here.  Look at them all excited.  They get air time.  All right.  So, what...  You know, I think Danny said it might...  Danny said I think he looked something like Ricky, the other intern. 
[02:49:30]  But then Nathaniel had a totally different look for what Ramone might have looked like.  And for all I know, everybody's got...  Danny, do you think it's...  I believe he looks like the cover of Rent Boys.  Danny, do you think it's a little weird that Steve has an imaginary friend named Ramone?  It's a little strange.  And what do you think Ramone looks like?  To me, he looks something like Hervé Villachez if he was normal-sized.  Oh, okay.  Or with the Ricky mustache.  Nathaniel?  Do you think it's weird that he has an imaginary friend? 
[02:50:00]  I don't know.  I kind of like Steve.  No, it doesn't...  Yeah.  It's not about liking him.  Do you know that we smash the people we really like on this show?  Yeah.  Well, I think he does have a whole persona worked out.  Yeah.  Definitely sort of a...  Yeah, I think Steve's given a lot of thought to this.  Yeah.  I mean, he hasn't stuck his hand in a sock and started talking to him.  It's probably good, but it could be soon.  No, no, no.  That's not happening.  But you do have to...  Is Ramone with you right now?  No, Ramone is not in the room.  Can you channel Ramone?  No, because you'll never hear from Ramone. 
[02:50:30]  You'll only hear Ramone being referenced.  You do hear from Ramone.  Steve's not here right now, Mrs. Torrance.  Ramone is the little boy who lives in my mouth.  Is Ramone your Jenny Piccolo?  It's a friend that we'll just never see.  It was Jenny Piccolo, right, from Happy Day?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Ramone will...  Yeah, well, kind of.  Ramone will never be referenced in the first person.  You'll never hear a little voice pop up and go,  Yes, sir.  You'll never hear that. 
[02:51:00]  You will only hear Ramone being referenced like he's being addressed or in the third person.  Do you want him to talk, but he's not as opposed to?  No, it's...  You like ice cream, Ramone?  Do you want to secretly be Ramone?  Oh, no, no, no.  Ramone's a house boy.  Yeah.  Ramone's a house...  You don't aspire to be Ramone.  I'm thinking you might want to be a house boy.  No.  Kind of like where someone tells you what to do.  I'll bet you in his mind Ramone is probably 5'10", very svelte, smooth abs, unclipped, hung 10, fat, doesn't speak English, willing to do anything for a buck. 
[02:51:30]  Is that who Ramone is?  Ramone.  Do we have an example of Ramone?  Does Derek have a promo he could play featuring Ramone?  Yeah.  He'll find it in a second.  How many Ramone promos are there?  Honestly, there was only...  I just did the second one yesterday, but I'm thinking there could be a series of Ramone.  Of course there will be.  When do you think maybe we should take Ramone to the doctor?  All right, if Derek's ready, let's hear the Ramone promo, Anthony. 
[02:52:00]  All right.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Ooh, it's in my shoes.  Ramone, clean this up.  It's a little weird, Steve.  Of course it is.  You know, your house boy's got to clean the crap out of your shoes.  Do you pay him well, at least?  No, house boys generally don't get paid well.  You're not making a lot of money?  No, I mean, let's say maybe he's Guatemalan.  Maybe he's uneducated.  You do great production for the radio show, but I've got to tell you, it's a little weird. 
[02:52:30]  The Ramone thing.  Did you buy him after his mother was killed in the tsunami because of child slavery?  Did a tree go through his mom's head?  No, actually, he is from Central America, I believe.  Oh, Central America.  Well, no.  I mean, the tsunami hit around the Philippines, so you're certainly not going to find any Ramones out there.  Is Ramone's last name Robinson, by any chance?  Hey, good reference, Danny.  Good reference, but no.  I didn't have to dress up.  That's very good.  Oh.  That's the fun of it, though.  All right, listen. 
[02:53:00]  Let's listen to the second Ramone promo.  This is, we debuted this earlier this morning.  I just love a drive in the country, laughing with Opie and Anthony.  That plane is flying awfully low, don't you think, Ramone?  Ramone, call 911. 
[02:53:30]  Now the Ramone promos are that much better and funnier.  Because now every time I hear this on the replay, I'm going to drive off the road.  Ramone, call 911.  It sounded like you almost said clean this up, but you went, call 911.  I was trying to enunciate it in the same fashion.  Now, Steve, why wouldn't you call 911?  Why does Ramone have to do everything for you?  Because, well, it's not, it's also, it's not me, but Ramone is a houseboy assigned to 
[02:54:00]  the menial tasks that this deep voice guy does not feel that he's.  I have a problem.  What?  You're taking a leisurely drive in the country.  Why is Ramone with you?  Say there's a menial task that has to be, that has to be, that has to be, that has to be  taken care of.  Yeah, road head.  Yeah, exactly.  Your mule is dirty, needs to be cleaned.  Ramone, lap this up.  Perfect example.  You go to a self-serve gas station.  Do you think this guy, this wealthy voiceover artist is going to be, uh... 
[02:54:30]  Ramone, top off my tank.  Right, right.  Exactly.  You're a couple weeks away from coming in here with a scarf.  You know, I'm thinking that this guy has, you know, almost the hef outfit, like a, like  a, um, not a leisure suit, what's it called?  An ascot and a smoking jacket.  Thank you.  How does Ramone feel?  Is Ramone, uh, angry at the guy?  Ramone could be angry.  He might be bitter.  He might be bitter.  He's crazy.  By the way.  Crazy Steve.  You have thought about this way too long.  There's a profile on your imaginary friend Ramone. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Um.  Behind his back, does he like, you know?  You, or, or, or the person that you're voicing in these spots, that's not Ramone, obviously,  is he married?  Um, no.  No, actually, you know what?  You know, now, now that I think of it, there are two, two of the little cartoons on, on,  on the website are, are pretty representative of what this deep voice guy and Ramone might  look like.  And Ramone is, I suck, uh, Ramone is a very short, or potentially very short, uh, pygmy. 
[02:55:30]  I don't want to alter it too much because, yeah, because I don't want to alter it.  Let people imagine their own Ramone.  Ramone should be, you know, everyone should have their own Ramone.  Should people start sending in, uh, maybe drawings and cartoons of what they think you  and Ramone are?  I think, I think that's a great idea.  Are like and look like.  There's some talented artists out there.  Has Ramone ever stood there and just thrown firecrackers while other people were preparing  to rob the house?  I'll get that one. 
[02:56:00]  Hmm.  Yeah, I do.  You got that one?  Yeah.  Um, trying to remember the name though.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Uh, was it Boogie Nights?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I mean, I knew, I knew the scene.  I didn't remember the movie.  Boogie Nights.  He's right.  He's right.  Yeah.  Ramone.  That is a typical Ramone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The guy throwing the firecrackers around the house.  All right.  Well.  That's a Ramone.  Ramone takes care of the menial tasks that you can't be bothered with because, you know,  you're off making the money and you can pay somebody, you know, you know, three bucks  an hour to go and clean up diarrhea. 
[02:56:30]  Really?  For a casual thing, you have his salary already worked out.  Yeah.  How much does he make?  Does he live for free in like the, uh, well, in the, uh, that, what do they call it?  That other house?  Servant's quarters.  Servant's quarters.  No.  The pool house?  Like the pool house or something?  Um, yeah, he could potentially.  He could potentially.  You know, you got to remember, he's, you know, he maybe doesn't have a great grasp of  the English language.  Uh-huh.  Um, you know, he's from Central America.  Um, you know, uneducated.  And no grasp of U.S. law as well.  I didn't say he was, I didn't say he was underage. 
[02:57:00]  I didn't say he was.  Oh, no, no.  I didn't say he was underage.  You weren't saying that.  Give the Photoshop people some, uh, some work on Wack Bag.  Oh, there you go.  Photoshop people.  It's not Steve.  So, you know, I don't think you have to Photoshop Steve in.  It's a deep voice guy with an, with a, uh, a little helper named Ramone.  Sure.  Jesus.  Yeah.  No, that's, you got like a guy with a pith helmet, like an old, uh, an old adventurer.  Yeah.  With the optic thing.  Yeah, he's got a monocle.  Oh, monocle. 
[02:57:30]  And like a pith helmet.  And binoculars.  Mm-hmm.  His name is actually Colonel Wetpants.  Yeah, Colonel with like the, uh, with like the little handlebar mustache thing going like,  well, there I was.  Yeah, exactly.  In Africa elephant hunting when all of the sudden Ramone came over.  And then Ramone is a black guy.  And he's a pygmy with a bone through his nose and in his hair.  With a big afro and, and like bracelets of bone.  Almost like a, a shorter LeVar Burton type. 
[02:58:00]  So Ramone's not black.  No, I don't see Ramone as being black.  No, I mean, but that's, you know, I see Ramone as Central American, maybe, maybe, maybe even Mexican.  Hairless.  I see Ramone as hairless.  See, you know, there's now, now we've got a completely different representation of Ramone.  You see a very hairy Ramone.  Um.  Of course you do, Steve.  See, really?  No.  A mini, a mini bear.  All Ramone can say in English is sweet and cozy.  Cozy face.  All right, well, thank you, Steve. 
[02:58:30]  We just, Anthony and I just noticed this whole Ramone thing that was kind of taken on a, a life of its own.  And, uh, and we had to kind of.  I thought you guys liked the Ramone thing.  We do.  Oh, okay.  And now they're even better now that we have the backstory.  Are you kidding me?  Of course.  Oh, okay, cool.  Who's not going to be paying attention to the Ramone promos?  And everyone's going to be looking forward to the next one in the series.  Okie dokie.  Ramone.  We're the only radio show that, uh, discusses show promos. 
[02:59:00]  I know.  The ins and outs of the show promos.  Well, we got a lunatic making them.  With his imaginary friends.  Dude, we're all.  This is apparently a very simple crime to commit.  All one has to do is buy a couple of multiple Metro cards, stand at the turnstops.  What the fuck are your problem, man?  It's the Opie and Anthony Assault on the Media contest.

Oh, I remember this.  Nathaniel came in with his stand-up.  Yeah.  And then we went on one of our dumb tangents about things that happen around Christmas. 
[03:01:00]  How did we do that?  Bad things that happen around the holidays.  Huh?  I'm going to listen in on this to see how we went from reviewing one of Nathaniel's stand-up acts  to bad things happening around the holidays.  Oh, I remember how it was.  How?  Because the audience was laughing and we were saying, wow, that's a gift.  And a gift being for Christmas.  That was the worst stretch ever.  I had to think of a gift one, but I'm laying back right now.  Yeah.  Guys, we've got to bring Nathaniel in here. 
[03:01:30]  We promised him that we would listen to his stand-up.  Oh, yes.  Well, we promised him a while ago.  Well, because he took the smell from Rich Voss' ear.  That's right.  Opie, this is coming off of seeing Brian Regan over the weekend.  I understand that.  It's a tough act to follow.  Well, we were going to do it on Friday after Brian Regan was in here, but we didn't think  it would be fair to the guy.  True.  Nathaniel's our intern and he does stand-up and all sorts of things on the side.  How long have you been doing stand-up?  About six months. 
[03:02:00]  Six months.  Very new at it.  Yes.  Did you have anything that inspired you to become a comic?  No.  I mean, I've always enjoyed the stylings of Jim Norton.  Who doesn't?  But, yeah, I just wanted to make people laugh.  Yeah.  And have you throughout your life?  Have you been known as, like, the funny guy?  Yes, I guess so.  You have.  And was there anything that happened, though, that was like, wow, you know, because  you just decided to go into comedy.  Did you see somebody, go, I could do that, kind of?  Yeah, I just took, I did, sorry, my story sucks. 
[03:02:30]  I just took a class and decided to give it a shot.  A comedy class?  Yeah.  Who taught it?  Uh-oh.  See, this is what I was digging for, people.  Yeah, what's up with these comedy classes?  Well, um.  Is it tough to teach someone to be funny?  You either have it or not?  I don't, I mean, I don't know.  I don't know anybody who's ever done well coming out of a class, but it doesn't mean  that there's not.  I, I, no, no, I probably don't, don't know that they took it.  Do they teach you, like, techniques?  No, it's mostly, like, writing and making sure you have, like, a point of view and identity.  I mean, some people show up and you're like, I can't wait for this person to give up comedy,  but.  More like.  Yeah, just because you go through this class doesn't mean you're going to come out the other end 
[03:03:00]  funny.  Yeah.  But just because you go to it also doesn't mean that you're not funny.  That's correct.  If you're naturally funny, you're going to go through it, take out of it what you can,  and then you move on and realize it was worthless and you have to gig every night obsessively  like Jim Norton does.  Um, yeah, the one I took two years ago, which turned into nothing, was taught by David LaBarca.  Oh, David LaBarca, he was, uh, related to Joe Ansis, who died, unfortunately, who was  the guy that gave Lenny Bruce his, uh, his whole lingo. 
[03:03:30]  Really?  Yeah, like, uh, you know, like, hey, daddy, oh, all that stuff.  Joe used to hang out at Dangerfields, man.  He was a very interesting guy.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he knew Lenny well.  He was one of the funniest guys, but he would never go on stage.  Sorry.  Isn't the best way to, uh...  Just do it.  Do it is just to do it.  Just go to the clubs and gig everywhere and take your, your crap nights where you bomb  and take your good nights where you kill and then just keep doing it.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Eventually.  For the past six months, I've been trying to do, like, three open mics a week and... 
[03:04:00]  Nice.  That's pretty good.  Very good.  Subject myself to that hell.  You got to bring people with you?  No, these are just, uh, five bucks for stage time.  Okay.  Tell jokes to comedians who won't laugh.  Yeah.  You pay five bucks to get on?  Yep.  That's something.  Five bucks.  That's pretty funny.  For a bunch of cynical, jaded asses that are just waiting to go on themselves, so...  Right, right.  That's pretty much the whole audience is the guys that are paying five bucks to get up  there.  Yep.  Wow.  It's delightful.  Really fast, we've got to rewind slightly.  Larry in New York, what's a mezuzah?  Oh, and hey, what's up, guys?  Hey. 
[03:04:30]  Listen, the mezuzah is put on the door, on the door frame by Jewish people.  It prevents evil spirits from entering your house, which means Norton can never see Anthony's  Christmas tree.  Well, he took...  Anthony took the mezuzah off.  Yeah, he took it off.  Hey, I took off my mezuzahs.  I don't want them there.  It'd be great if I left it on my door and some Arabs attacked me thinking I was Jewish.  Exactly.  So explain that I'm not.  Something tells me, in the area you're looking at for an apartment, there's a mezuzah on every 
[03:05:00]  door.  Yeah, there are a lot.  Yeah.  You know what?  Jewish people make fine neighbors.  They don't cause a problem.  They don't join gangs, unless you consider bankers gangs.  They're wonderful neighbors.  I'd be happy to live among all Jews.  We're all gays.  They're great neighbors, too.  Just gotta smell that awful food that they cook.  No worse than my gassers, Ant.  Believe me, they'll be complaining about me.  They'll just be going, mmm, who's cooking the matzo ball soup?  Jews are fine neighbors.  All right, so we got Nathaniel's... 
[03:05:30]  Jimmy Norton Berg.  His last appearance at Caroline's.  This was about a week ago, right?  Yeah.  A week ago tonight, I think.  Yeah, it's one of the worst intros ever, too.  Well, you checked off the ones you want us to play, right?  Yes.  Okay, so this is Nathaniel's.  This is the intro and him getting his act going there.  Is this CD you're playing available on eatabullet.com?  Were you selling it December 23rd at the downtown?  Yes.  Naughty Nathaniel?  Now that would work.  All right, let's listen to Nathaniel's act here. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  From the Connecticut, welcome Nathaniel Bryan.  From the Connecticut.  There we go.  There we go.  Where were you in the lot?  Hi.  No.  Does anybody else's mom get a huge kick out of humiliating them?  She's taking a poll.  Mine does.  She started pretty early with my name, actually. 
[03:06:30]  She and my dad teamed up to give me the nickname Than for Nathaniel instead of Nat, Nate, or Nathan,  which is an awesome nickname if you never want to pick up a chick at a bar because most of the  conversations go something like, hi, I'm Than.  Stan?  Than.  Sam.  We're not hooking up, are we? 
[03:07:00]  Conversation has run its course.  I actually introduced myself to this one man.  I was like, hi, I'm Than.  And he goes, oh, is that Vietnamese?  I can only guess he was looking at my Asian features.  Turns out he was wrong.  I'm Korean. 
[03:07:30]  But I guess we all look the same to you, don't we, asshole?  That's good.  Getting some big laughs, actually.  Yeah.  Sounds very natural, too.  Yeah, the mix is a little bad, I think.  You kind of have that relaxed guy thing.  What do you come up on stage and it was kind of a long time in between, you know, when  they announced you and the applause stopped before you said something.  So what do you just kind of like stroll around, look at the crowd?  No, I just like put my bottle of water down. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, was that it?  Yeah.  You don't want to look too eager?  Yeah.  High-fiving like Leno before you go on?  High-fiving the crowd in front.  The opening joke's a little, not a bad opening joke, it's a little bit slow.  Aside from that, it's good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's not bad.  All right.  Except he breathes like La Mata when he was doing material.  All you wonderful people.  Going back to the phones for one second here.  Jay in Indiana.  Yes, Jay, real fast.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Love your show. 
[03:08:30]  If you want to know how good Jewish neighbors are, just look at Anne Frank's family.  They were great neighbors.  Never made a sound.  I'm punching out.  Oh, God.  First of all, what do you mean Anne Frank's neighbors?  Anne Frank was Jewish.  The German people were her landlords, technically.  But he's saying that the Jews were quiet.  They never said how quiet the family was.  The Jewish neighbors.  And he's talking about the Franks, I guess.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Never heard them partying up a storm or anything.  All right, here's more of Nathaniel's show at Caroline's last week. 
[03:09:00]  My mom's big into self-improvement.  She takes a lot of herbal supplements.  She takes like 30 pills every morning, which is a lot.  I've asked her, you know, what could you possibly need 30 pills for?  She said, like, well, this one's for memory and this one's for my immune system.  I like to ask her which one gets Dad to move back in.  That's pretty funny.  Apparently none of them is the answer.  Hello? 
[03:09:30]  Hello?  Hey.  What's this thing on?  Hello?  It wasn't a bad joke.  No, it was very good.  It wasn't bad at all.  So Dad left Mom, huh?  Yeah.  On Father's Day, I helped him move out.  It was great.  Are you kidding?  No.  How long ago?  Three, four years, five years.  You helped him move out?  Yeah.  On Father's Day?  Yes.  And what was he saying to you as you're loading the truck with his stuff?  There was no surprise, really.  I was happy for him.  Proud of him.  Wow.  Yeah.  Well, you saw a lot of fighting growing up?  Yeah, well.  What was the big problem with your parents? 
[03:10:00]  It was all verbal.  Actually, I think my next bit.  Oh, really?  Oh, look at how he is.  He is good.  My act speaks for itself.  He is good.  Well, let's take a listen to find out the answer to that question.  Yeah, my parents are divorced.  There were some early warning signs.  Dinner conversation was one of them.  They sort of went along the lines of,  Lowell, why don't you put that fat from the steak directly on your chin? 
[03:10:30]  To which my dad would reply,  You're the one that cooked it, bitch.  Really, I'm just happy that a man named Lowell got laid and made me.  That is a tough first name.  God bless him.  Problems at the home.  Yeah.  It was just like, I would be, you know,  not to bring the show down too much,  but I wouldn't want to have friends over too much 
[03:11:00]  unless they were already in the circle and knew that it was going to be hell.  You knew that you were just going to hear them yelling at each other?  Yeah.  I had the yelling parents too growing up until they got divorced,  and it was just, you know,  Oh, can't you two just shut the fuck up for like one night?  For one night, always,  Hey, son of a bitch!  And then you'd see like the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti  and throw it,  and it would hit like the wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there horrified watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall. 
[03:11:30]  Like, oh.  Fuck you!  Get the fuck out of this!  Oh, fuck you!  Oh, and the horrified kids just sitting there.  Did Dad actually leave after the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  Huh.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep  because the yelling would stop.  Yeah.  That's, you know,  First, Mom would have to wind down a little.  You know, even after Dad left,  she's still going, you know.  Ah, fucking asshole!  Eat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head!  Son of a bitch!  Comes in here and I'm trying to sleep! 
[03:12:00]  He's gone!  Shut up!  Just shut up!  Oh.  Take me!  I'll tell him to go fuck himself!  If he can fucking...  He's coming back!  No way!  Is that...  Oh, God, he's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back, the next day?  Yeah, like the next day.  And then everything would be alright?  Find some chick to go sleep with or something.  Would everything be okay the next day and they would...  Yeah, like it would just...  You'd resume again, I guess, like normal life.  Would they go upstairs, have sex, 
[03:12:30]  make up sex and all that?  I guess.  I wasn't too...  Until the next fight?  I didn't have much of a perception of that kind of thing,  but I guess, yeah, if everything was fine.  You know, they'd be sitting down watching, like,  Ronan Martin's laughing, laughing,  everything was fine, you know?  And then out of nowhere, it just...  You'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed and you'd hear, like...  Outside the door, just talking!  Just talking!  What do you mean by that?  It's like Ronan Martin's laughing is on, you know?  So they're kind of... 
[03:13:00]  Laughing.  And then you hear...  And then you hear from the kids' room.  Oh, God, the trauma.  Daddy's leaving Bobby!  Motherfucking fuck you!  Fuck you!  It was always creepy, like,  anniversaries and birthdays. 
[03:13:30]  It'd be like...  They'd fake it for a day.  And it was just so creepy, like,  oh, yeah, we're buying it.  You love each other today.  Sure.  Yeah, yeah.  Here's the gift.  Oh, we got her a vacuum!  It's a real loving gift.  My dad actually once got my mom  a porcelain figurine of a warthog  for Mother's Day.  Jeez!  If that doesn't speak volumes...  Passive-aggressive, yeah.  Oh.  That's hilarious.  And then we were pretty young,  so, you know, we got the talk.  Like, I realized... 
[03:14:00]  And we all knew.  Like, we were real young,  but it was so obvious.  You know,  oh, Dad only comes home  on the weekends now  because he's at work?  Shut up.  You're insulting me.  And then we got, you know,  called into the room,  and Mom sits down and goes,  me and your father are...  I want you to know,  and I want you to know  it has nothing to do with you,  but we're divorced.  Oh, okay.  Could I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life? 
[03:14:30]  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Good.  Well, thank you for staying together  for so long  and really, like,  torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one  like five years ago  when maybe we couldn't remember as much  and didn't have to listen  to the yelling and screaming?  This was supposed to be  about his commentary.  Yeah, I know.  Holy mackerel.  We're all just staring at Anthony  like, make it stop.  All of a sudden,  it's about me.  I kind of feel like you did  in your room 
[03:15:00]  while listening to your parents.  It's a little uncomfortable, Anthony.  Here's an idea pop.  There you go.  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  Sorry, it's not about me.  Just kind of, you know,  look at, hey,  your act touched the nerve.  There you go.  How about that?  And I must say,  mine isn't the worst case scenario,  that's for sure.  I knew a girl once,  remain nameless,  whose father, 
[03:15:30]  father walked out on the family  on Christmas Day.  On Christmas Day!  That little tidbit of baggage  will stick with a girl for a while  makes Christmas a fucking treat  for year after year.  Let me tell you that one.  Hey, here's a present.  Yeah, my daddy left on Christmas.  Fucking Christmas.  Here it is again.  Merry Christmas.  I think I know who you're talking about.  Oh my God.  Oh no. 
[03:16:00]  I gotta go.  I don't know.  Christmas Day.  Do you know how this screws up Christmas?  Let's go take a leak, Jimmy.  Do you know if a father has to be  that goddamn selfish,  he can't wait till the 26th?  You can't wait a day?  He's gotta screw up Christmas  and, you know, fine,  screw up your own family.  Do you realize you're screwing it up  for every guy that has to,  that's trying to make a relationship  with your daughter?  Because every Christmas,  you, especially the first one,  takes you by complete surprise.  Everything's fine and dandy.  That's hilarious. 
[03:16:30]  You're thinking,  oh, man, this is a special day.  I just started dating this girl.  It's our first Christmas together.  First Christmas together.  I got a nice stack of presents for her.  Oh!  I've been listening to Christmas carols  in my car all the way over to her house.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Right.  Honey!  Honey!  Right.  Mary!  What?  Why are you crying?  It's Christmas.  Christmas is jolly and fun.  What's the matter? 
[03:17:00]  Oh, I gotta tell you something.  Oh, fuck.  More baggage I hadn't figured out.  You know, usually a guy can figure  some of the baggage out.  That's hilarious.  You can't see that one coming.  That's so true.  You can't see that one coming  until the 25th.  Till old St. Nick is supposed to be  wiggling his fat ass down the goddamn chimney.  That's when you figure that one out.  My father left on Christmas.  Thank you, Pop.  Job well done.  At that point,  you should have just taken all our presents 
[03:17:30]  and thrown them in the fire.  Exactly.  It would have been a happier moment.  He did.  He left on Christmas.  Goodbye.  I'm going.  Well, that's what you should have said.  And you know what?  I'm taking his lead.  I'm off.  Well, you did do that,  but I think 10 years later, right?  It wasn't Christmas.  Oh, you should have waited  until Christmas, though.  You really should have waited.  You should have had that  vicious intuition  and waited until Christmas.  Oh, my God.  And say,  I now understand why he left you. 
[03:18:00]  That would have been a bad one.  And slammed the door.  That's just not that mean.  I'm leaving.  It just really isn't that mean  when it comes down to it.  Anthony is a very nice guy.  I know you.  Dressed in a Santa cap.  That is funny, though.  Feeding away from the house.  That whole baggage thing  when you get into a relationship,  you have no idea.  You think you got it all figured out  until a holiday comes  or Father's Day, in my case.  You think you got it figured out.  Oh, Jesus.  Father's Day, in my case,  was the big one.  Why was that a big one?  Door slamming and crying all day.  I'm like,  what the hell happened here? 
[03:18:30]  Isn't that great?  Aren't the dates  of what things happened  just tragic?  Jeez, they come out of nowhere.  Oh, the Christmas.  I got the visual, though.  You got the gifts  all piled up nice.  Probably wrote out a nice card.  Knowing you,  you might even have  a Santa hat on  because it was your first Christmas.  Really just giving it your best.  Giving it my all, by gosh.  Yeah.  Dude,  one of the worst cases  of chick baggage  I ever had  came out of nowhere  because this wasn't  on a specific date 
[03:19:00]  or anything.  One day,  my girlfriend just  burst into tears  out of nowhere.  No, nothing, nothing.  Is this a girl  that I don't know?  Yeah, this is one  you don't know  from years ago.  All right.  It's like,  what happened?  What's the matter?  Blah, blah, blah.  Nothing, nothing, nothing.  Jesus Christ,  what's wrong?  Every year,  around this time of date,  she started getting  a little weird.  And I never knew  what the hell it was.  Find out,  her mother  was an alcoholic, 
[03:19:30]  always drunk.  She was leaving  for school one day  and she says goodbye  to her mom  every day  and her mother's always  like drunk,  passed out  or something like that.  So one day,  she's passed out  on the kitchen floor  and she says goodbye  to her and goes to school.  She comes back,  her mother's dead  on the floor.  She had slipped  and cracked her head  on the counter  and when she said  goodbye to her  in the morning,  she was already like,  she had already  hit her head. 
[03:20:00]  So maybe if,  you know,  I'm sure she went  through years of thinking  if I only called  the hospital,  blah, blah, blah.  She left her there  on the floor  because she had  always been passed out.  So when did,  did you try to help  this bad, bad girl?  I know.  I said,  jeez,  miss,  not paying any attention  to anything.  Yeah,  I tried to help her.  No,  you don't help,  it's just baggage.  So that was obviously  the anniversary  of the death,  right?  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  the anniversary  of that every year.  Jesus,  and you'd see it 
[03:20:30]  coming from weeks away  and you're like,  oh,  it's that day.  You see it bubbling  under the surface.  Oh,  it's mom clocked  her head on the edge  of the counter day.  Spend the whole day  waxing the kitchen floor.  You know,  there's no Hallmark card  to get her for that  occasion.  So your mom  whacked her head  on the counter.  Sorry to hear,  whoops-a-daisy.  Whoops-a-daisy.  Whoops.  Whoosh,  crash. 
[03:21:00]  A little cartoon.  Bringing up some memories  really fast on the phones  and then we'll go back  to Nathaniel's comedy.  Yeah,  I don't want to shut him out.  It's his day.  Bill on Long Island.  What's up,  Bill?  Hey,  how's it going,  guys?  Hi,  Bill.  What's up?  Oh,  Bill.  Christmas,  I was like four years old  and everything's going great  and then for some reason  my grandpa locks himself  in the basement  and my dad drives away  and I don't see him  at Christmas Eve  and I'm a little four-year-old.  I'm like,  where's daddy gone?  And family,  there was a huge fight 
[03:21:30]  and daddy didn't come back  for a few days  and then next year  the exact same thing  happened again.  Every year?  Yeah,  the worst  and no one ever told me why.  That story's kind of sad  but Tennessee always beats out  any sad story.  Let's go to Jim in Tennessee.  Listen to this one.  Go ahead,  Jim.  Hey,  tell your cute story.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Oh,  yeah,  it's a funny story.  We should have Christmas songs playing.  Yeah,  hold on. 
[03:22:00]  Hold on.  We need a nice Christmas song.  Wait a minute,  Bob.  Let's do this bit.  We got to get some Christmas music.  There we go.  All right,  Jim,  tell your cute little Christmas story.  Tell your cute little Christmas story.  Okay,  my father,  his birthday is on Christmas.  He gets plastered.  He's in the Air Force.  He's the Chief Master Sergeant.  He comes home.  My sister's pouring his whiskey out  down the sink  so he doesn't get any more plastered.  He takes the bottle 
[03:22:30]  and commences to busting her over the head with it.  Yeah.  Oh,  16 stitches  and,  you know,  he was the Chief Master Sergeant.  Nobody was going to talk.  Of course.  You know,  take him to jail,  you know,  but.  Well,  that must have been a Merry Christmas.  Yeah,  Merry Christmas.  That must have been a fun,  memorable Christmas for the kids.  I have a worst Christmas story. 
[03:23:00]  I don't want to tell you.  I never told it on the air.  Oh,  come on,  Jimmy.  I just remember one year  my friend was married  and he didn't want to be married.  He took a little boat ride.  Oh,  God.  Why does it always have to go back to the world?  Conor Peterson.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Oh,  boy.  Yeah. 
[03:23:30]  All right,  we have another one,  Anthony.  Dave in Queens.  Dave,  go ahead.  What's up,  guys?  What's up?  Hi.  Hey,  a little nervous,  guys.  Hi,  boo-boo.  Hi,  Frida.  Love you,  Frida.  I was mad.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was married for about two years  and I was,  you know,  the sex was always a little weird  with my ex-wife,  with my wife at the time.  And she told me,  can you hear you guys?  Yep.  Yeah,  Frida.  She told me that her father  got her pregnant when she was 12.  Oh,  Merry Christmas. 
[03:24:00]  Merry Christmas.  Let me make a long story short,  it didn't work out well after that.  Dude,  if I heard that story,  my girlfriend would wonder  why every Christmas  I had a throbbing heart on.  Well,  you know what?  In actuality,  it started one time,  I was joking around saying,  who's your daddy?  She just made a straight face  and she said,  don't say that.  Oh,  wow.  I didn't take anything of it  and then,  you know,  sex got weirder and weirder  and after that,  it all went downtown.  What a curmudgeon she was.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas,  everybody.  What selfish parents,  man.  George in Jersey, 
[03:24:30]  what's up,  George?  She's a selfish girl.  Hey,  guys.  Hey,  this is a true story.  We're planning a big family Christmas.  Everybody's coming in  from around the country.  My 70-year-old grandparents  are coming up from Florida.  Three days before Christmas,  my father calls me up  and says,  I'm going to divorce your mother,  but I'm going to tell her  after Christmas.  Right.  So now we're all sitting there.  Everybody comes in.  The brothers,  my brothers are sitting around  the Christmas table  just waiting,  just waiting for that  special moment  where Dad's going to say, 
[03:25:00]  by the way,  I believe in your mother.  It was miserable.  It ruined Christmas.  It was horrible.  They're all geared up  for the big  I'm getting a divorce  from your mom story.  But here's the worst part.  The worst part is  Dad goes to see  a divorce attorney,  finds out he's going to lose  20% of everything  that he owns.  That's out of it.  And now we're stuck  with my family  for Christmas  for the rest of my fucking life.  Yeah, see,  it would have cost him  too much  so he didn't get a divorce.  There you go.  At least they're together  for the right reasons. 
[03:25:30]  Merry Christmas, everyone.  Merry Christmas.  Earl in Alabama.  What's up, Earl?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just, uh,  I'm a truck driver  and I was coming home  for Thanksgiving  last year, 2003.  Thanks, Dave, and Christmas.  Holidays.  Sure.  Well, hang on.  It all goes over  the whole holiday season.  All right, let's go.  But I found out  on my way home  that my wife  was banging a prison inmate.  We ended up  signing divorce papers.  We ended up  signing divorce papers  the day before Thanksgiving. 
[03:26:00]  I got to come back  down there  on Christmas Day  because, you know,  we've got a five-year-old daughter.  So to see my daughter,  I had to go in there  and see this guy  living in my house  with my Christmas tree  and everything,  you know,  with all my stuff.  That ruined Christmas Day  and then to ruin  New Year's Eve,  that was our anniversary.  Oh, man.  There you have it.  There you have it.  His wife was banging  an inmate.  Merry Christmas, everybody.  I got it from a Negro.  I thought I heard Negro. 
[03:26:30]  Oh, banging inmate.  You can whip me all  you like, white devil,  but you'll never  break my spirit.  I don't know  where my other clips are.  I know.  I see that.  Aaron and Callie.  What's up, Aaron?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  I just got a pretty  messed up Christmas story.  I was going out  with my girlfriend  for a few years  and I was probably  19 at the time.  Well, we had some problems 
[03:27:00]  and broke up for a while  and she decided  she wanted to get  back together  but at the time  I had already  got another girlfriend  and we were living together.  Well, so my parents  thought it would be  a good idea  to bring my old girlfriend  to my work  where I was living  with a new one  and try and get me  back together with her.  Well, basically,  I was kind of pissed off  so I go home  and tell the girl  I'm living with,  well, hey, my parents,  they brought my old girlfriend  over and they're wanting  me to get back together  and, of course,  my girlfriend's  reaction is to get  pissed at me  and basically want 
[03:27:30]  to break up  so I'm thinking,  well, you know,  maybe I should get  back together  with my old girlfriend,  you know,  because she was pretty hot  or whatever  and so, anyway,  I called her up  and we made plans  to go over to her house  on Christmas Day,  well, I did,  and got back together  with the girl  I was living with  and she was crying  and sniveling  and whining  and, well, basically,  I felt kind of bad  so I was like,  well, no, I called  my old girlfriend  up on Christmas morning  and said,  sorry, I'm not  coming back together,  it's over 
[03:28:00]  and basically  all I heard  was this click  and after listening  to you guys  I'm thinking  she's going to have  some emotional trauma  for a long period  of time.  So, punch it out.  Thank God.  Too late.  I know.  Just in time.  Everyone else punched out.  You were the last one  to punch out.  I didn't like the anyone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the guy  that has to turn off  the lights.  He's the last person  listening to the show today.  Flip the lights  on your way out.  Lock up.  Lock up, please,  because everyone else left.  Eric, what's up? 
[03:28:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Yeah, I was about  nine years old.  Me and my sister  had a paper route  and my father was  mechanically quite  and if he wanted  the grass,  he would set  the house on fire.  So, Christmas Eve  comes home all drunk.  He falls into the bushes  and, you know,  him and my mom  have a fight  and my sister  go to bed.  I wake up like  three o'clock  in the morning  and I hear something  in the living room.  So, I go downstairs  and I see my father  what I thought  was taking apart  these bicycles  that he was actually  trying to put them together.  So, I got all pissed off 
[03:29:00]  and, you know,  he was taking apart  the bikes  that Santa left us.  So, I thought  I'd throw the presents  at him.  My mother wakes up,  she's screaming.  It was just  a friggin' debacle.  So, your drunk dad  was ruining  your presents.  No, I thought  he was.  He thought he was  but he wasn't  but he still  kind of beat up  his father  a little bit there.  Yeah, he was trying  to put them together  and I didn't put  that together.  Alright, nothing worse  than the father-son brawl.  Never had one of those.  My father would have  killed me.  But those things 
[03:29:30]  are just the most  awful things ever  when the son  is beating up  the father.  I almost had one.  I picked up a stick  out of the garage  and my father's like  come on, let's go  in the backyard.  Get out.  I'm like, nah.  You gave up  right there, nah.  What were you  picking up a stick  for, you ass?  I was drunk.  I was drunk.  You were drunk.  Yeah, he didn't mind  the stick at all.  He was ready to take it  and smash me with it.  So, I felt  even in my drunkenness  I felt it would be  prudent to  replace the stick  and end the quarrel. 
[03:30:00]  You're quite a  willful young boy,  Jimmy Norton.  Alright, let's go.  Naughty.  Let's try one more.  James in Arizona.  What's up, James?  None much,  just listening and loving.  Alright.  My story is that  I come back  from being deployed  in the army.  Yeah.  My wife was pregnant.  It wasn't mine.  I've been deployed  for 13 months.  She's seven months  pregnant.  We got a divorce  right before Christmas.  It was finalized  on Valentine's Day  exact.  Wow.  There you go. 
[03:30:30]  I found that  to be perfect.  What a great Christmas.  You wrecked two  holidays for her.  Yeah, that was  just fucking  magnificent.  No, she wrecked  him for him.  Yeah, that's true.  Did she try to  explain the pregnancy?  Uh, yes.  She said that she  slipped and fell  on someone else's dick.  Slipped and fell  on someone else's dick.  Uh, Mark.  Yeah, hello?  We want to end up  on an up note.  Help us out.  Yeah, my girlfriend 
[03:31:00]  kicked me out last  year Christmas.  She boxed up all my  shit and put a bow  on it and left it  at my apartment.  Nice one.  That's a clever girl.  And kind of funny  and silly at the same  time.  Oh, we got one more.  Yes, one more.  Scott in Texas.  Yes, Scott?  Yeah, when I was a kid,  the little kid next door,  Jimmy Norton, he forced  me to play Monster Snow  under the porch on  Christmas Day.  Monster Snow.  God, we know what  Monster Rain is.  What is Monster Snow?  It's when you put on 
[03:31:30]  snow pants.  It makes it that much  more difficult to do.  Yeah, because you're  both shivering.  Oh, oh, oh, grr, brr.  All right, well, let's  get back to Nathaniel's  comedy tape.  Sure.  Three of Ten.  It's not about us,  douchebag.  Yeah.  This will seg nicely  into my observational  humor about airplane  food.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Airplane food?  I don't see that.  Oh, okay.  I was just trying to  get disgust from  Jimmy.  I think you're going  to talk about  the airplane food.  Disgust from Jimmy.  Just look at my  stomach in this T-shirt.  I think you're going  to talk about  country clubs here,  right?  Yes. 
[03:32:00]  It's Nathaniel,  our intern.  Like Frank said,  I am from Connecticut,  the suburbs.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Very waspy place,  as you'd expect.  Actually, our local  country club's motto  is we will have a Jew  by the year 2015.  I'm not sure if that  means we're going to  have a Jewish member  or if they will have  captured one.  That's funny.  But they're hell-bent  on getting one either way. 
[03:32:30]  Also, a very, very  small black community  in my town.  Or as we called it,  Carl.  That's good.  Funny.  I like your delivery.  It's very deadpan.  I definitely like  that delivery.  He's getting some  big laughs.  Joe from Miami  saying,  Nathaniel ripped off  Richard Belzer's voice.  You'll still have  a bells sound  to your voice.  It's not the same  delivery, though. 
[03:33:00]  The Jew joke  is good.  The Jewish joke.  Yeah.  But you should say  Jew second, I think.  Like, we will have  a Jew by the year  2015.  You should say  by the year 2015,  we will have a Jew.  It's a funny one  at the end.  It's paced better.  Oh, look at that.  The pacing's better.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's still a good joke.  Okay, here's Nathaniel  talking about waiting  for a subway.  But I even tried  the nice white job,  too, for a while.  I worked for an  investment bank,  which was awesome.  Yeah. 
[03:33:30]  That's about the  appropriate level  of enthusiasm  right there.  One person clapping.  thing.  But, again,  I knew it might not  be for me because  during the morning  commute, of all things,  I'd be waiting on  the subway platform  being like,  here comes the train.  I could take it to work  or throw myself  in front of it.  I wonder what  the third rail  tastes like. 
[03:34:00]  Probably tastes like  sweet, beautiful  freedom is what  it tastes like.  That's very funny.  Thanks.  All right,  let's go right  to the next one.  It's Cherokee.  I was psyched,  though.  I thought I was  less white, actually.  I found out  I was 164th Cherokee.  But I sort of  thought about that  and I was like,  so that means  my great-great-great-grandfather  had sex with  a Native American woman, 
[03:34:30]  right,  in the 1800s.  I have a hard time  believing that  was consensual.  I'm white  and a descendant  of a hate crime.  Good.  Wonderful news.  That's good stuff.  I was just about  to criticize you  for not enough  rape jokes  coming through.  Look at that,  doing Jimmy proud.  Like a trooper.  All right,  we got one more  from Nathaniel, 
[03:35:00]  our intern here.  I take jiu-jitsu,  too,  to defend myself  from some of these things.  Could you say jitsu-ju?  It's cool, though,  when you start,  they're like,  why do you want  to take jiu-jitsu?  A lot of people say  fitness or confidence,  whatever.  I think my reason  threw them,  I was like,  I want to take jiu-jitsu  in case I'm ever  wrongfully imprisoned  and need to ward off  the amorous intentions  of my fellow inmates.  As soon as I said  that,  I was like,  you know what,  take that back,  I would kill  for that kind  of attention.  All right,  you guys have been  awesome.  Thanks a lot. 
[03:35:30]  Prison rape joke.  Thank you very much.  That's some good  laughs in that.  Not bad at all, man.  Very good.  Very good, Nathaniel.  And you do other things?  You do a little acting?  I think it came to  everyone's attention  that you're in a commercial.  Yes, I have been  in several TV commercials.  Several?  Yes.  Which ones?  ETOPS,  TOPS Trading Cards Online,  Presence,  ETOPS.  Comedy Central,  I was actually on a  30-second promo. 
[03:36:00]  It was all me.  It was pretty cool.  Really?  Yep.  It was the  You're Among Friends  promo.  I don't know.  Among Friends.  You're Among Friends,  Ricky.  It was Ruth Gordon  holding your cut wrists  while Martin Mull  milled about  and Chris Makepeace  just sat there.  You're Among Friends,  Ricky.  Come on,  Hobson.  Wow,  that is good.  My bodyguard.  Yes.  And also,  NFL Network, 
[03:36:30]  that aired during  playoffs last year,  which is very cool.  Yeah.  And most recently,  National Geographic Channel.  National Geographic Channel,  that's the one I heard about.  Yep.  I'm in a doctor's office.  You're in a doctor's office  sitting in a chair.  Yep.  In the waiting room.  Yep.  And I also do improv  and sketch on the side too.  Oh,  that's what we got to get  a little more of in this.  More sketches.  And he takes good coffee orders too.  The next time you come in here,  I'm going to yell freeze.  Freeze?  No,  we don't do any of that 
[03:37:00]  short form stuff.  No?  No.  All right.  Let's hear it for Nathaniel.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Ron and Fez.  XM 202.  It's Ron and Fez,  and our show starts next week  beginning September 12th  on XM 202.  I am excited.  Fez,  not so loud.  This promo may be running  on the loft.  Let's take it down a little bit.

[03:40:30]  This channel is experiencing technical difficulties, please stand by, we are working on the problem. 
[03:41:00]  Surfing the net continues to simplify, but if you use search engines, there are a few tips you should know.  Welcome into Tomorrow, I'm Dave Graveline.  Justin Osmer is a project manager for MSN, and he says you can make the search engines work for you.  If you put quotation marks around what you're looking for, that'll help you find it much more easily,  and will give you back a result that exactly matches that term.  So, for example, if you're looking for an air conditioner, you put quotation marks around air conditioner,  you'll get results back that say that exact phrase, rather than a bunch of results that may just be about air 
[03:41:30]  and a bunch that may be about conditioner.  Any innovations at MSN?  Well, something new that just launched this last week is the opportunity for a local search.  And at MSN.com, at the top of the search box there, you'll see a link to local search.  And what local search does is provide you with local information that has addresses and phone numbers coupled with a map.  Searching into tomorrow, I'm Dave Graveline at Graveline.com. 
[03:42:00]  Scott Walterman, XM Satellite Radio News.  This is an XM Satellite Radio Red Cross operation helping hand update.  The Red Cross still funneling all of its resources and focus on the hurricane-ravaged area from Katrina,  and they still need your help.  Here's Renita Hosler with the Red Cross.  Our Canadian and Mexican sister societies have offered up support as well,  that these folks will be the ones who will come in and help give our workers in that affected area a little bit of a respite, if you will, 
[03:42:30]  because they do need to tend to their personal matters, and they do need to be with their family at this time,  and they also need to just take care of themselves.  The Red Cross is now operating about 268 shelters in the hurricane-ravaged area.  They continue to need your help.  You can call them to become a volunteer or donate.  1-800-HELP-NOW.  This has been an XM Satellite Radio operation helping hand update. 
[03:43:00]  High Voltage is an XL channel, which may include explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by contacting XM Listener Care at 1-800-XM-RADIO.  The U.S. Anthony Show.  Hi, everybody. This is Huey Lewis, reminding you that you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony,  and you really ought to have something better to do.  Laszlo.  Our buddy Laszlo.  Laszlo.  This is when Laszlo came to the studio and talked about his cute neighborhood.  What's over for him?  The kid begins, like, cursing a bit. 
[03:43:30]  Laszlo talks about the guy's, um, the bitch he comes out with a carrot.  That was really annoying on so many levels.  That really was.  That bugged me.  Holy crap.  Well, guess what new character just found his way out of the Opie and Anthony program.  No, no, no, no, no.  You should have just let it bomb.  But no, you had to give him life.  You understand there were ashes there, and you were Frank Phoenix, and you brought him out. 
[03:44:00]  Laszlo and something about his kid neighbor doing funny voices.  Check it out on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I like funny voices.  Shut up.  No.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You like, uh, I like the intro to Laszlo's show.  I like it all.  Where's, uh, Eric?  I want to play that again.  Who's the kid?  This kid, there's three kids, the Ferrante boys.  They live across the street from me.  All three of them have been in every Grand Theft Auto since Grand Theft Auto 3. 
[03:44:30]  They're like king shit at their school.  Oh, I can imagine.  They are king shit.  They have the perfect kid voice.  They have that perfect voice for those things.  The one kid that does the Tell Him Fred is James Ferrante, and he delivered the killer  line in Grand Theft Auto Vice City at the opening of a commercial where he screams,  Dad, no one wants to hear about your stupid Vietnam stories.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  You remember that one?  Yeah, that was him.  Yeah, he's genius.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Well, yeah, so I played that intro in the hop. 
[03:45:00]  So what are you, the creepy guy that brings him into your studio?  Well, what's funny is I always show-  Welcome to Puppy Town, kids.  I always show scripts to the parents, you know, and say, are you cool with them?  And as the game sort of progressively got a little bit more edgy, the parents started  rejecting scripts.  Oh, no.  The parents are like, no, this won't do.  So I got to find somebody that's got a hormonal problem and can sound like a, you know, of  legal age.  They did a great job. 
[03:45:30]  I'm trying to get my niece.  She told a story recently.  You know, my brother-in-law, he's just a freak.  He doesn't care if his kids are listening to this show, you know.  Whatever.  I mean, that's what a parent decides.  Yeah.  Whether their kids can handle this.  Whether they can or not, right.  She's like four, and she goes, in her little girl voice, she goes, you know, Uncle Greg,  I was listening to your radio show recently.  Uncle Greg stopped.  And you've got a really bad mouth.  We turn it on just to hear you say, who the fuck farted?  And she delivers it in such a way, in this little girl voice, I'm like, I go to my brother-in-law,  Mike, I'm like, you've got to get that on tape so we can play it on the radio. 
[03:46:00]  And then she's like, you're driving us crazy with the cursing.  She's four.  Yeah, she said, who the fuck farted?  She was reciting what I said on the radio.  Who the fuck farted?  And there's no problem with a kid that age, like, saying bad words?  My sister wants to strangle, you know, my brother-in-law all the time.  Yeah, because it's a whole, I mean, my sister compared to me is the sweetest thing in the world.  Yeah.  That's why people don't even understand that she's even related to me.  But she's married to a guy that's like, you know, he might as well be one of my brothers. 
[03:46:30]  He's like an uber fan and doesn't care if the kids are watching porno.  Cursing kids is just hysterical, but it does make for problems when they're out in public.  You've got to Mike the niece, man.  Get that in here.  Yeah.  You know what?  Yeah.  But another bit just popped into the head.  Uh-oh.  We're going a bit crazy lately on the show.  So, ladies and gentlemen, send in audio of your kid's cursing.  That's right. 
[03:47:00]  All right.  That's an easy one.  That's a very easy one.  Yeah.  Because I know there are parents out there that are very open-minded and have no problem doing this.  You don't have to give your real name with the audio.  So, maybe you can, you know, save face.  I think.  At the family functions.  An easy way to do it because it's not just, we just don't want to hear fuck or shit.  Right.  Maybe, again, movie lines with a lot of cursing in it.  Well, just take it and run with it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want movie lines, them just cursing normally, whatever.  And we'll play the best ones on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  And I got some ideas for some videos that you might want to send in along the same lines.  Jesus.  Stop.  Jimmy.  You're going to reen it.  Yeah.  But immediately, there's an assignment for America.  We like to give America an assignment every once in a while.  Assignment America.  We got to have it.  Why don't we make up some production for that?  Yeah.  Because Steve should have been on that.  We go down that road every once in a while.  Assignment America.  This is your assignment, America.  Your kid's cursing.  Send them into the Opie and Anthony program immediately.  You tools are actually calling me out on the underscore, underslash thing. 
[03:48:00]  You're getting a little too sensitive out there.  Yeah.  It's not like I said, underslash.  I guess that's called an underscore then, the little thing.  Right.  Okay.  Yesterday, because I sent that to Steve and Ben at like two in the morning and I was sort  of like half ripped.  And I sent it to him and I said, hey, I thought you might.  It was Tuesday.  I said, well, dude, I've been working ahead because I'm splitting for Alaska on Saturday. 
[03:48:30]  But I, so I said to him, I said, you might find, find this funny and you know, if you're  listening or whatever.  And I said, your old company is quite a joy because, you know, they asked me if I'm interested  in maybe doing a show for like on a Friday night.  And I said, I'll do three or four as a, you know, as a goof.  And I thought I'd come out swinging with a little reference that like, you know, got  to show props, show allegiance and shit.  And so I sort of come to the next day and I check my email and it's like 80 million emails  of who, who, who, tell them Fred. 
[03:49:00]  I'm like, what happened?  And so I like email one of the guys back and I'm like, what's going on?  It's like, oh yeah, they were, you know, talking about it this morning.  So I'm like, uh oh.  So I'm sitting there with the clock counting down to the replay, you know, the pests, they're  everywhere.  Tell them Fred.  But here, here's the intro to your radio show.  I think it's brilliant.  Actually, it's really, really good.  Listen to this.  Laszlo's intro to his radio show.  We have a number of very important goals to accomplish together in this first lesson.  Hey, how do you become a radio DJ?  Say the name of the station over and over. 
[03:49:30]  Play at least a half hour of commercials.  Broadcast lines from the clicky mine.  Smash lots of sounds together.  Talk on and on about how you invented radio.  Don't Fred.  Play the same songs again and again and again and again.  We'll teach you how radio stations operate.  If only I could win crap tickets.  I'm not going to start the stupid show, Laszlo.  That is brilliant.  And after I got done talking, and I'm scared shitless because I haven't run a board in a while. 
[03:50:00]  Hotline flashes.  And this guy's like, who's this?  And I'm like, this is Laszlo.  And he's like, what was that?  And I go, it was my opening music.  You didn't even begin your stupid show.  I know.  Because they don't have a sense of humor.  It's like, oh, this is so-and-so with Infinity.  Who authorized this?  And I said, dude, you're going to have to talk to, you know, Rob Cross, who's the operations manager or whatever.  I said, because if you don't, like, here's the deal.  I haven't run a board in a while.  And you're about to have, like, dark fucking air, dude.  And so then, I mean, like 20 minutes into it, and I'm talking about how weak and stupid and gay blogs are. 
[03:50:30]  And, you know, who wants to hear about some stupid guy's trip to the library?  And then I hit that other thing you played yesterday.  Yeah.  Which is this.  Which is this.  Let's play it first, and then you can tell us what happened.  Dear Blog, I had a wicked cool day at the library.  I've really been obsessing about my old high school girlfriend, Julie, so much lately that I said, what the hell?  I decided to look her up. 
[03:51:00]  She lives in the next town over, so I got her address and stopped by.  She was really surprised to see me.  Then I slashed her throat.  And I went right from that into commercials.  And I had, like, Hotline flash it again, and it's another guy that works for the company.  He goes, what was that commercial that just told people to slash women's throats?  Oh, God.  I'm like, oh, dude, this is not going to last.  Thank God.  And then.  Thank God you're here to remind us that we just don't want to go back to that atmosphere ever. 
[03:51:30]  And then there's one of the guys that was going to be on the show with me.  He's a guy I've worked at out at DRE on Long Island.  And I don't know if I can even say his name, but he's sort of the in-stadium announcer for a major sports team around here.  Bob Shepard?  He was, no.  He was leaving.  Thank you, Laszlo.  He was leaving the game.  We were saying he's going to be coming in in a little bit.  This is, like, at the 25 or something.  And I said, well, maybe he's going to be a little late because, you know, it's the big Harry Potter book thing tonight.  And, you know, maybe he's going to be in line eyeing up young boys and girls.  Well, the major sports franchise is calling him on his cell phone. 
[03:52:00]  And while he's on the elevator at K-Rock, you can't go on that show.  Oh, brother.  You know, we can't.  You know, we're a major family-oriented sports team.  You know, they can't think that there's a pedophile.  And this is hour one.  And I'm like, you know what?  I can't fucking do this, dude.  That's three in, like, no time.  I can't fucking.  I was, like, shaking after the show.  I was like, this is weak.  Well, we've got a place for you on 202.  We're going to start building out the channel, I think, sometime in September.  We'll have to figure out something for you because you can't work in that environment. 
[03:52:30]  And it just shows you the sense of humor that they have at the old company, Infinity Broadcast,  and that they're hotlining you.  They don't have a sense of humor whatsoever.  This is like an 80-page thing that they gave me the week before because they started getting a little nervous.  And they're like, so what are you going to talk about?  And I said, I don't know.  And they started to get a little nervous because the last project I worked on has some senators clamoring for a federal investigation into it.  Yeah.  So they give me this, like, 80-page missive that was put together by a lawyer and Tom Chiasano.  And I was looking through it.  I'm like, where's the ONA stuff? 
[03:53:00]  Where's the ONA stuff?  And it gets in there.  They don't say ONA, but there's a little bit in there about blasphemy.  Really?  Yeah.  Blasphemy.  I guess that's what you were in trouble for.  Yeah.  Blasphemy.  Wow, that's heavy.  So they said that now blasphemy falls under FCC.  That's hardcore.  Yeah.  Blasphemy is not an FCC violation.  That's what this thing says?  They're lying.  You highlighted that part?  I highlighted all of it.  And it has every FCC judgment.  You're going to take a little look.  We just have to read these on a weekly basis. 
[03:53:30]  We were mentioning this earlier with, what, Carlos, I guess, huh?  Expletives.  Shit, fuck, piss, cunt, cock, sick, a motherfucker, tits.  It's unacceptable.  But there's seven dirty words.  There's other ones, too.  Never broadcast on even an occasional or fleeting basis any time of day, including Safe Harbor.  Included in this category are such terms as prick, dick, pussy, titty bar, hard-on, asshole, douchebag, twat, cock.  Douchebag is not an FCC violation.  Broadcast should also avoid language that, while perhaps not rising to the level of expletive, may otherwise be considered to be objectionable by the FCC. 
[03:54:00]  And that includes douchebag, twat, cock.  Yeah.  Yeah, we used to get these all the time.  They bring up the Super Bowl halftime show.  That's from Steve the Lawyer, right?  It has to be in the Steves.  It's in that lawyer spacing, you know, that word-perfect spacing.  So, innuendo and double entendre.  But they don't mention us by name like we never existed, right? 
[03:54:30]  Right.  Fucking assholes.  Which is why in the first 30 minutes of the show, because I called Cousin Ed and I was talking about, you know,  Babe Fest and how we were hanging out backstage with Jim Norton, who is hysterical, and he's on the Opie and Anthony show.  So, you know, I was pulling the name a few times.  Just to dump out everyone.  The FCC has recently defined profanity in as many as six different ways.  Blasphemy, divine imprecation, is that the word? 
[03:55:00]  What does that mean?  Example, go to hell and God damn you.  You can't say that anymore on commercial radio?  Oh, wow.  That's what this memo says.  Personally reviling epithets naturally tending to provoke violent resentment is an FCC violation.  Wow.  Grossly offensive language that amounts to a nuisance with nuisance defined to be language that is prejudicial to the sense of decency or morals of the citizens at large. 
[03:55:30]  Tell them, Fred!  Hoo-hoo!  Vulgar or coarse language and words that are as highly offensive as the word fuck to be analyzed case by case by the FCC.  Words that are as highly offensive as the word fuck.  What does that mean?  That means the word nigger.  That means maybe the word spick.  What that is doing is that's opening the door for ideology to creep in where it's no longer like in Canada.  Their FCC, whatever they're called, is a disgrace. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  They're worse because they have like ethnic things you can't say.  That's what that's getting into.  That's going to start getting into you're not allowed to do racial remarks.  Things that are not considered profanity.  I applaud commercial radio, and I'll tell you why.  They're playing right into the satellite radio hands, man.  Keep doing it, scumbags.  Please keep doing this.  Please keep sending out these pamphlets to your jocks.  Please, please, please.  It's giving them a much bigger door to work with fucking with people.  That's what it looks like.  Here's a violation, which the FCC determined to include graphic and explicit references to sexual activities. 
[03:56:30]  Female voice.  I masturbate with Jeremy's video every day.  Not every day, but every other weekend.  Craig's voice.  Wow.  What is it that you like about him so much?  Female voice.  The way he licks pussy.  I want to do a threesome with him.  See who's the best.  If I can lick better or he can lick better.  Of course that's a violation.  That's a violation.  They used to hand us stuff like this and go, you better read this.  Right.  This is shit.  And they would highlight stuff like that. 
[03:57:00]  And I'd read it and go, would we ever get on the air and say lick pussy on broadcast radio?  They would give it to us like we're fucking children.  Effing.  Effing children.  You have to be careful.  They'd give it to us like we're fucking children.  Which means they'd give it to us like we're happy.  There are so many examples there.  That thing was such a, the first part was the scariest shit I've ever read.  And then the second part is the transcripts from like every FCC judgment and how much they got fined.  And it's pure comedy. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  We used to read these things on our, on our old show.  Blast for me.  You can't, you can't knock God on commercial radio.  But that's where the conservatives have just got to just.  Can you believe that is actually now something that is actionable by the FCC?  God damn you.  Go to hell.  Taking the Lord's name in vain.  Dude, the Texas Taliban have taken over, bro.  Yep.  Absolutely.  God.  Unbelievable.  Keep playing into our hands.  That's why satellite radio is going to rule. 
[03:58:00]  It's phenomenal.  There was actually a commercial that played during my show that was talking about how great advertising is and call your infinity representative today.  And I, I hit the button so it wouldn't fire straight into the next spot.  And when the commercial ended, I go, and be sure not to sign up for satellite radio and then hit the next spot.  So I have a meeting at one o'clock today with KROQ.  Please call us tomorrow.  Because I know they're firing you.  It's obvious.  So.  Can you tape it?  Huh?  Oh, I didn't even bring my mini disc.  That was really stupid.  They're going to fire you.  So make sure you take really good notes.  Well, you know what? 
[03:58:30]  Maybe, uh, it's a tax write-off.  If you buy one of those little recorders, they don't cost that much.  And by the way, you're a smart guy, Jim.  Oh, really?  By the way, radio stations are playing those spots all over.  Like, I heard the same exact spot in Philly when I was driving through.  They only play those spots when they're desperate for advertising.  Sure.  Which shows that commercial radio is starting to really hurt.  When you see a billboard that says, your ad here, that means that billboard sucks and doesn't work.  Right.  Yeah, that billboard's not making money.  It's just sitting there waiting for someone to call it.  It's like the billboard's alive so they can advertise.

Hey, this is Joe Perry, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  When do I get my own sound machine?  Oh, you want one?  For a day.  So you can go, uh...  Koolah!  Make noises?  Not that one.  Shut up!  No.  Shut up!  That's mean-spirited.  That one?  Shut up!  That's mean-spirited.  I'm scared of you, sir, and I'm protecting myself.  I don't like that.  It's too vague.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[04:00:00]  Nah, music kills it.  I don't buy my mail.  You'll never get your own machine.  Oh, exactly!  But Opie, I want a machine.  You'll never get it.  I want to push buttons.  You want a machine?  I love a machine.  Why is everyone whispering?  I know.  Don't you understand we're broadcasting?  Yeah, what are you whispering about?  Yeah, Steve, what were you whispering?  All I hear is-  Rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr.  What were you whispering?  I was, uh...  Sorry, everyone.  Jesus.  I isolated some Frenchie clips for Anthony's instant replay, so I just was telling Eric  to get them in. 
[04:00:30]  Was it?  Really?  Yeah.  Frenchie clips, huh?  Yeah.  Pretty relevant.  I know.  So that's up there on the need scale.  How about those new water bottle caps we ordered?  Yeah, those two.  Well, those are coming.  It was something Ben had asked me to do.  Anyway, we're going to talk about news teasers.  We love news teasers.  Yeah.  And this was the start of the Pat battle?  What does that mean?  I guess we're going to have to sit back and listen to this bit.  Listen.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[04:01:00]  I know we're going to do news teasers where the news scares the shit out of you, and then  it's going to turn into something else, I guess.  Oh, this was the time that, oh, I got it.  Yes.  Now you get it.  The start of the whole Pat battle phenomenon.  And it really is sweeping the nation.  Well, not anymore, but a lot of people have tuned into this channel, and they're like,  why are they referencing this stupid Pat battle person?  This is the day it all started.  We call her P to the B.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Smash my bitch. </pre>
