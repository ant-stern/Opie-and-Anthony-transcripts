<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie and Anthony discussing their own illnesses and the inherent difficulties of taking sick days in their line of work.  This segued into a critique of other WNEW shows, including "Don and Mike," "Ron and Fez," and Tom Likas, with the hosts offering a mix of sarcastic commentary and humorous comparisons to their own style.  Their conversation also touched upon their experiences with stock market investments, specifically focusing on their involvement with WWF stock and the Palm Pilot IPO.

A caller then brought up a major water main break in Union Square, prompting a series of crude jokes about the ensuing disruption and the ironic possibility of the homeless population receiving an unexpected cleansing. Further calls followed, with listeners offering contrasting opinions on the station's newer shows—some praising the changes, others reaffirming their allegiance to Opie and Anthony's more abrasive, unfiltered approach.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dominated by a discussion of the Bill Cosby allegations, specifically a police report filed by a woman accusing him of inappropriate behavior.  This sparked a lengthy, graphic conversation about the hosts' perspectives on the incident, including sexually explicit jokes and anecdotes about sexual encounters.  Callers joined in, sharing their own experiences and opinions, adding to the already risqué atmosphere.  Jay Moore, a guest from LA, along with Kaz (whose location was jokingly questioned), actively participated in this segment.

The show concluded with a brief, somewhat tangential discussion of upcoming musical releases, including new albums from Tool and Pearl Jam, and a collaboration between the Black Crowes and Jimmy Page. This segment was interspersed with additional calls before the broadcast ended.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Anthony is evil, but Opie's worse than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start here on the Opie and Cool and Inhuman Show.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, man.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show!  Yes.  The Dopey Duo!  That's right. Riding into town again.  For another fine day of radio programming, Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Absolutely.  You know what? I'm going to say it right now. Let's get some coffee.  You need coffee again?  Yeah, I've had this goddamn cough and stuff, you know?  Yeah, it's been hacking. I'm sick.  It's been having a really rough week.  But I don't take off from work because this isn't work.  Like, I used to take off for the drop of a hat when I was knocking tin for a living.  Yeah, when you have a real job and you're feeling a little scratchy throat or something,  you're like, oh, I get to call in sick.  Yeah. 
[00:01:00]  But now it's like, what am I going to do? Sit home and pretty much do what I do here?  Yeah, hang out and goof on stuff.  But you really have to be sick to call in sick for this radio job.  Yeah.  Which I had to do in November, unfortunately.  Like, the only way I would call in sick and the only way I did call in sick,  which is going back to when we first started here,  is when you can't get up.  You really cannot, you've been so sick where you stand up and you get that fuzzy feeling  and you're all woozy.  And you feel like you're just going to topple over. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, that's when you have to say that.  That's when, you know, I'm not in because I can't get in.  If I could get in and just plop in the chair, that's fine too.  I'll broadcast with 102 fever. What the hell?  Well, my problem last time I had a call in sick, I just didn't have a voice.  You kind of need a voice to do a radio show.  That's true.  I started losing that.  At any given moment, I could just go into this mode.  Right, right.  I was like, hey, how you doing?  Pack and flag.  Come on.  Flag. 
[00:02:00]  Well, I hope Mr. Cosby isn't sick today.  Because I think we're going to need Mr. Cosby later on on the show today.  Cosby, what's up with the Cosby?  We're going to just have a little fun with the girl.  We'll get into that a little later.  Slip of the Jell-O pudding pop.  Want to say hi to everyone that had a swim to work today?  Oh, yeah.  Union Square, just an absolute mess.  It's so funny, man.  There are just so many pipes just waiting to explode in the city of ours. 
[00:02:30]  Ancient pipes.  They say these pipes are like well over 100, 150 years old.  Yeah.  These things.  I mean, what lasts that long?  Nothing.  My favorite water main break is when, you know, it happens and it swallows cars out of nowhere.  Yeah, big hole in the road.  Car's gone.  I like when it's those goddamn livery cab drivers.  Maybe with their water main break in Union Square, they cleaned up some of those bums. 
[00:03:00]  They've got their first bath in 10 years.  Oh, brother.  Well, we haven't said hi to anyone yet.  No.  Our phone line is 212-757-1027.  Let's go to Tom.  Tom, what's going on today, man?  Thanks.  Hey, Tom.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  You're on the radio.  Hey.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Doing well.  What is the deal with Don and Mike?  The show that comes on after the show?  I'm telling you.  I'll take Tom Likas. 
[00:03:30]  What?  For him any day.  No way.  They're horrible.  Dude, what are you kidding?  Dude, Tom Likas?  All right.  Tom Likas sucks.  But these guys, beyond.  I lasted about five minutes.  See, that's just it.  You've got to give these shows a little time.  Because you're kind of used to hearing what Ant and I sound like.  I mean, every show has a different feel to them.  You can't just punch into something.  Because, like, you just punch into this show, it's just a couple of idiots talking.  But after you get to know us a little while, you hate us even more. 
[00:04:00]  Wait a minute.  That doesn't work.  Yeah, but where are they coming out of?  They're coming out of D.C.?  Uh, yes.  They blatantly were ripping New York.  They don't like New York at all.  I wasn't getting that impression.  I listened last night.  I was finally able to drive home and listen to a show on the radio.  I was online last night, and I was checking them out.  And then I checked out the first part of Ron and Fez's show.  And I'm like, wow, this is the first time after Ant and I get off the air that I'm tuning in at EW to see what's going on.  Bro, check out.  I checked out Likas the first few weeks he was on, and it was painfully obvious that I couldn't get into that show. 
[00:04:30]  Come on.  But I spent a good hour, hour and a half with Don and Mike, and then another hour with Ron and Fez late last night.  It seems like they've got that typical radio voice.  You know, the one that Anthony always makes fun of, the typical, you know, CBS.  Oh, hey, CBS.  I'd rather listen to Mad Dog.  Well, you want the goofy, wacky voices.  If you want the goofy, wacky voices, then check out Fez.  That's a wacky voice.  There's no DJ voice there. 
[00:05:00]  Unbelievable.  I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you, Tom.  I so far am digging the two new shows, and I'm not just saying that.  Well, anything's better than Likas, I guess.  Yeah, and the radio chick's doing a fine job.  For the first time in a while, we're very excited about working here at N.E.W.  For real?  There's things going on.  Yeah, we feel like there's at least, you know, there's a plan.  There's shows that want to win, and they sound all right.  When are you guys going to get syndicated? 
[00:05:30]  I know you guys talk about it a lot, like, every day, but come on.  Let's do it.  That's funny, right?  Let's do it.  If we could keep our names out of the paper, I think it'll happen.  Yeah, it might happen.  Unbelievable.  I don't know.  I don't know what the company has in store for us.  We would love to be syndicated.  Be nice.  Be good.  Seems like everyone else is allowed to, but we're not.  But I guess that's fair.  So, we'll just patiently wait.  Hey, what's the WWF stock at today?  I bought it.  I'm taking a loss.  Yeah, it took a little dip.  What was it, down an eighth today or something like that? 
[00:06:00]  Oh, no.  It went up yesterday.  What did?  Your old pal Ann dumped out.  I dumped out.  What, you got scared on that one?  Yeah, you know, if it doesn't move at least a couple of points in one sitting, I got to get out.  I don't sit on something very long, though.  I just bought in on a few things when the NASDAQ took a dip today, about 1 o'clock or so.  Bought in some stuff.  Now, I'm waiting to toss it.  Well, I had CBS. 
[00:06:30]  And I got rid of CBS for that crummy WWF stock.  And I took a loss big time.  Who's your financial advisor?  Oh, my Lord.  CBS for WWF?  Horrible.  Bad mistake.  We got to get Stockbroker Dave to talk stocks.  Did you see what this Palm did today?  Palm and IPO came out today.  Those little friggin' Palm Pilot things.  Oh, I heard about that.  Yeah.  Spinoff of 3Com.  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  $38, the IPO. 
[00:07:00]  The thing went up to, like, the $160s.  And that settled down to, uh...  Last I checked, it was at $106, something like that.  But, yeah, people were buying in.  I was reading the message board.  People buying in at, like, $145.  And they're getting told they sell it at $119, and they're crying.  Crying.  Yeah, IPOs aren't a guarantee.  IPO.  You've got to be insane to buy into an IPO when the market opens that day.  You're insane.  Because it's going to be run up so high that by the time you get in, it's got nowhere to go but down. 
[00:07:30]  Remember Zoom opening?  Remember my experience with the IPO on Zoom.com?  Yes, I do.  Oh, I got Zoomed up the yim-yam on that one.  I got Zoomed right up the keister.  Maybe the WWF will go up once they get Stephanie McMahon off the air.  There you go.  Really?  I've had it with her.  It's going to happen soon, you know.  Shea McMahon has come back, and it's just a matter of time before Vince pops his head back into the action.  Exactly.  I don't go up.  Well, Tom, thank you very much.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right, man.  All right. 
[00:08:00]  Let's go to John.  John, you're next on WNEW.  What's up?  Yo, Owen, what's up?  How are you?  Good.  How are you guys doing?  Great.  All right.  That guy's crazy.  Don and Mike are pretty good.  Yeah.  So far, so good, right?  I found myself laughing.  Yeah, they were making me laugh.  The intro's a little long.  Yeah, I think Ant and I need some, like, slick Hollywood radio show open.  They're a little more polished than we are, that's for sure.  No, and Don and Mike are like Opie and Anthony, Ed, 10, 15 years. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, you know?  You know?  That might be it.  We like this edgy, rough feel to our radio show, right?  Yeah.  You ever watch, like, it's the Archies and then the Little Archies cartoon?  Yeah.  We're like the Little Archies.  We're like the Little Archies.  Or the Flintstones, and they had the baby Flintstones.  That's us.  Yeah.  Baby Flintstones.  We don't need a show opener or nothing.  We just kind of, like, you know, just a couple of teams to open it up.  We just get into it.  We don't have a schedule of things we're going to talk about. 
[00:09:00]  No.  That would help at times.  It really would, but we don't.  I feel like I'm back in school.  I know.  No, but you...  When you've got nothing to do on the show, you just go to us, because we have nothing to say either.  Yeah, and we can rag each other.  You can rag on us.  Well, that's the dangerous...  Those are the dangerous shows.  When Ant and I don't have anything to say, and then we're like, all right, let's rely on our listeners.  And we go to the phones, and you guys are sucking, too?  Oh, no.  I mean, you guys are...  They're happy.  Don't be, they have nothing to say.  And they were like, okay, let's go through our O&A archives and try to play some old bits and get us through this mess. 
[00:09:30]  I hate to talk about equipment here in the studio, but I can't deal with this.  Look at your monitor for the phone calls.  Yeah.  Is it doing something to your eyes?  Um, no.  It looks the same as it always did?  Oh, yeah.  Columbo did something to my monitor.  He probably cleaned it off.  No.  Yeah, right?  There might have been some splooge on there or something.  There's probably like a dust film on it that kind of toned down all those bright colors you're looking at.  I'll tell you what it is.  The frequency to the monitor is not synchronized with the frequency of the computer. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, so it's like going...  Yeah.  So I'm getting this wacky thing happening.  I think it's your virus sitting in, Ant.  It's driving my eyes crazy.  I can't...  It's that virus sitting in.  I can't look at it.  All right, John.  All right.  Yo, Opie.  Yeah.  Boop, boop, boop.  That is a blast running fast.  Later, guys.  Okay.  Hey, Opie.  Is it time for the all-request and dedication hour? 
[00:10:30]  Okay.  Hey, who's on Homegrown tonight?  Which band is going to be featured on Homegrown?  Hey, don't you have an air conditioner put in?  Shut up.  Ass.  I wanted to do a construction down the hall.  I wanted to get in there.  Maybe hang a couple of pieces of ductwork for old time.  I took you out of hell, and this is how you pay me back.  Oh, come on.  Okay.  It's the all-request and dedication hour.  Shut up.  Breaker one-niner. 
[00:11:00]  That was Ant's radio show.  I was on Motorola.  16 to base.  16 to base.  That was my radio show.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Let's go to Pete.  Pete, you're next on NAW.  What's going on, man?  Opie.  What's up?  What's going on, Anthony?  Hey.  What are you guys up to?  Talking to you, man.  Hey, I was just thinking about this, about the whole Donna Mike thing.  Yeah.  I used to live down in D.C.  I used to listen to them.  They are actually very, very good.  Yeah. 
[00:11:30]  But the thing is, we're so used to just like is sucking that we have this trigger reaction  to turn the radio off after you guys show them, yeah.  So a lot of people, I think that everyone in New York, I mean, like New York's a tough  market to hit, and like I think that we all just need to like give them a chance.  You know something?  This guy is completely right because I was driving, I drove out of the garage, and it  took to the West Side Highway to go, oh, my God, wait a minute, there's something to  listen to on NAW.  There's a new show we got. 
[00:12:00]  I was listening to K-Rod.  Exactly.  And then I punched over back to NAW.  You're just used to turning off.  I mean, you literally had, when like is follow your show, I don't know if you guys  fully realize the capacity of this, you really had all of the O&A listeners literally change  this station.  Yeah, I know.  Showed up in the numbers.  I mean, it was like, it was like sort of like, you know, just a second nature after,  you know, some point.  So like, we just have to give Donald Mike a chance.  I used to listen to them down in D.C.  They're pretty funny.  They do these like crazy Vegas style shows.  It's a cheap thrill. 
[00:12:30]  They're a good show.  All we ask is you guys give them a chance.  Definitely.  We can't make you like them, but at least give them a chance.  And a couple of days isn't going to do it.  You've got to listen.  You've got to kind of get to know the characters and who's who.  That's it.  You can't just decide after five minutes.  Who the retard on the show is.  Who's the intelligent one.  Who does the voices.  It's definitely, definitely a good show.  You guys, we should give it a chance.  Who's the raving lunatic.  You know what I found really funny yesterday?  We went back to the office after the show and they started ripping our bosses, who were 
[00:13:00]  their bosses too, you know, down in D.C.  Yeah.  Just started ripping our bosses a new a-hole.  I heard that.  And they're still new bosses to us, so you don't lay right into them.  You know, it's a new boss.  You get a relationship.  You know, you can't really call somebody an a-hole until they're a good friend of yours.  You know what I mean?  So we're not even at that point yet.  And to listen to them just tear and Jeremy apart.  We were crying in the office.  It was hysterical.  That was great.  I guess they know each other very well. 
[00:13:30]  You know, we're going to give them a few more days, maybe another week, and then we're  going to, like, maybe simulcast and get all four of us on the air at the same time.  That would be cool, actually.  I think that could be fun.  That could be really fun.  All right, Pete.  Really quickly, though, before I go, to all the listeners, give them a chance.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You know, because you listen to them in Washington.  Yeah, they're good.  They're good.  Just give them a chance.  If you don't like them in a month or so, then so be it.  At least you can say you gave it a chance.  Exactly.  All right, man.  All right, fellas.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  There's a detective on the line.  Chris, you're next on NAW. 
[00:14:00]  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  All right.  Listen, man, I've got water main break.  Yeah.  You're just there.  Yeah, heavy situation down there.  I've been watching New York 1.  It's a mess.  Well, you mentioned how old the water mains are.  Yeah.  Some of the pipes they're digging up there are carved out of wooden logs.  Oh, my God.  That's how old it is, man.  That's great.  That's amazing.  New York City, there's wooden logs carrying the water. 
[00:14:30]  Hey, could you guys do us a favor and get some of those bumps to take a bath in that water main break down there?  Oh, yeah, and they all come down with buckets, you know, and they start filling up when they see the water main breaks.  And, you know, put them in their homes and they end up.  That's funny.  Listen, man, hey, could I put out FU to my brother, man?  Yeah, what's his name?  My brother, Rick, man.  All right, man.  I want to put out FU to him for busting up the family.  All right, cool.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  You guys suck.  All right, bro. 
[00:15:00]  See you later.  There goes Chris, the detective.  Nice.  Some of those pipes carved out of wood.  They're fighting out.  Carved out of logs.  Like the Indians that we hear before they sold Manhattan made those log pipes that are under the ground.  You think that's true?  Come on.  I wouldn't doubt it, man.  You know, this city is old.  Water main pipes without logs.  There is some crap under these streets.  You have no clue what's going on down there.  There is a whole other world going on under this city.  I would like to take a tour of, you know, some of the stuff that's going on under this city. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I saw one of those stations where they take you on a tour of all the old, like, subway stations that are officially closed down to the public.  You can't even go down into the, you know, the subway station.  Yeah.  And they open up manhole covers and stuff, and they bring you down.  And it's still like a subway stop with the ticket booth and everything from the past.  And you can check it out.  Ancient history.  Oh, that would be nice, though.  Oh, look at that.  Look, it's a dog.  Oh, look.  Oh, wait, that's a rat. 
[00:16:00]  The New York City's still a rat.  Stay away.  They got some big ones down there.  You don't want to F with them.  I saw a guy, a homeless guy, over on Broadway, right around 72nd,  pushing a shopping cart with clothes in it, homeless guy,  and a huge live rat on top of the pile of clothing in his shopping cart.  And he stopped and scratched the little rat under the chin  and then got back behind his shopping cart and started pushing it again. 
[00:16:30]  It was his little pet, huh?  There were just these moments that happened in New York,  because most of the time you're just walking down the street and you don't notice anything.  You go to the store, you go to work, whatever you're doing.  But then there are those moments when something happens and you notice something.  Yeah.  That I noticed.  You noticed that one.  Only that, and the other day also, a moment I noticed, I'm driving to work.  I see this woman, white woman, 500 pounds, had to be 500 pounds, 
[00:17:00]  on the median with a Walkman on, dancing.  Dancing.  Like shaking hard.  Crap.  That's what makes New York special, though.  It was the drive that I usually, I'm just, okay, another red light, another cabin,  another way, another, I'm trying to get to the parking lot.  And it took me like, oh, my God, what is that?  It snaps you out of that whole lull that you're in,  that whole hypnotic state that you go through when you're in New York,  when you see something like that.  That's the stuff that makes the city go round and round.  Oh, yeah.  Remember, you just brought up something that reminded me of something. 
[00:17:30]  Remember when we were working in Boston,  and the huge lady that fell through the sidewalk?  God damn, that was funny.  Yeah, she was about...  350.  350.  350.  350, 400.  About 350.  350, 400, maybe.  Yeah.  And the sidewalk gave way and swallowed her.  Yeah, she just fell into like a sinkhole,  fell into the sidewalk and couldn't get out.  And the front page of the Boston Herald, I believe it was,  it was just this huge, huge lady stuck in the middle of the sidewalk. 
[00:18:00]  Stuck in the sidewalk.  Because she fell through.  And the fire department's trying to pull her out with some,  the jaws of life or something.  And they had one fire guy in the hole with her trying to pull her up as well.  We made a huge poster of this front page headline.  Yeah, it was like six foot by three foot.  And we had it in our office for years.  It made us laugh every freaking day.  Every day.  Some things happen like that.  They're just moments that get your attention. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  Dan from Valley College, New York.  Valley Cottage, New York.  What do you think of the Bill Cosby episode?  What was he looking for?  Jell-O?  Well, we'll be talking to the cause hopefully a little later today.  Yeah, I think the cause might need some coffee to compensate for the medication.  You think?  All right, we'll get you some coffee.  All right, let's take a break, Anthony.  All righty.  We're going to regroup, move on to other topics here.  So give us a call, 212-757-1027. 
[00:19:00]  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Booty dooty.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Open the air after the day.  1027-WNAW.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  How many times do we have to tell you?  You're a little chubby.  You know, you're packed on the pounds for winter.  You've got to get rid of it.  Now, Stacker 2.  Or you're going to be in our ugly ass competition the next time we do a road show.  Do you want to be part of the ugly ass competition or the hot bikini contest competition? 
[00:19:30]  Your choice.  Go either way.  Either way, though, we could use you.  Yeah.  So if you want to win the prize for ugly ass, do not listen to this spot.  It is not for you.  Stacker 2 would not be for you if you want to win the ugly ass contest.  That's right.  But if you want to lose the pounds, then get that nice, slender ass Stacker 2.  It does three things, Anthony.  It burns the fat.  It also builds muscle.  That's the other thing it does.  It crushes the cravings to snack in between meals.  And it gives you a boost of energy. 
[00:20:00]  Wait.  That's four.  That's four now.  I know.  I apologize, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  But it does build muscle as well.  Okay.  It's Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  They have a website, stacker2.com, or give them a call at 1-800-LIGHT-LINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E.  Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  Thousands, thousands have proven it works.  Opie and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  And our phone number, 212-757-1027. 
[00:20:30]  The fax line, 212-957-9639.  I'm kind of bummed we were supposed to talk over a little tool act, Anthony.  Oh, it didn't start playing?  No, we love tool.  Misfire.  A misfire of a car team.  Oh, damn.  Because then I was going to, like, seg into the fact that tool is heading into the studio,  and they're going to have a new album out later this year.  Oh, so that would have worked out perfectly.  You see how radio works?  See, we would have came out.  Here's the tool, right?  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:21:00]  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  Hey, Anthony, this is tool.  Yeah.  We love tool, right?  Oh, yeah, rock.  This is Crawl Away.  Hey, Anthony, do you know tool is heading into the studio, and there's going to be a new album out later this year?  Thank you for that bit of spontaneous information, Opie.  I really appreciate it.  And while we're talking about bands, hey, Fat Boy Slim, live mix CD coming out March 28th, Anthony.  Yeah?  Pearl Jam, new album coming out later this year.  Uh-oh.  A European tour begins in May. 
[00:21:30]  Do you have a problem with a new Pearl Jam CD, Anthony?  I don't know.  You know something?  Every time the new CD comes out from Pearl Jam, I just get a little scared, because the first song they release off it usually blows monkey ass.  It's a marketing strategy.  I guess so.  I'll tell you what it is.  When a band gets really, really popular, they could hand in anything to radio stations, and they're going to play it.  Does that mean the stations are going to start bringing up the Pearl Jam from the catalog, start playing some of the older stuff before the new thing's out? 
[00:22:00]  And we could start hearing, If I ever hear that one again, I'll just drive into an embankment.  I got to admit, I've given up on Pearl Jam.  Given up.  Used to really, really like them a lot, but I could care less.  He ought to shoot himself, become like Legendary, like Kurt.  Oh, my boy.  Oh, my boy.  Oh, my boy. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, my boy.  She's going to win.  She's going to win.  Bye-bye.  All right, Anna, I could turn you out to something today.  A lot of great phone calls.  If you're on hold, hold on a second, all right?  What?  The new Black Crow's Jimmy Page song, man.  What?  What?  Oh, you're not a Black Crow's fan, are you?  I'm not a big Black Crow's fan.  I'm a huge Black Crow's fan. 
[00:23:00]  See them all smoking weed, saying, hey, why don't we get Jimmy Page?  And my diss band this morning was Southern Harmony, man.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was tracking through some new No Doubt.  Shut up.  Hey, people, that's a callback from yesterday's show.  That's right.  Anyway, this song has been available only on the Internet.  You can download it as an MP3.  But is it going to be in store soon, Ben?  Do you know?  You have to purchase it through the Internet.  Yeah, but we got a copy.  And you want to check it out, Anna, or what? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, what the hell?  It's the Black Crow's and Jimmy Page.  This thing rocks.  All right.  I'm listening.  A lot of Black Crow's and Zeppelin fans very excited about this damn thing.  Right?  It's called What Is and What Should Never Be.  You know, the old Zeppelin tune.  Reworked with Jimmy Page and the Black Crow's, live from L.A., recorded last year.  The track can be downloaded at windowsmedia.com.  But we have it for you here today.  I'm looking forward to it.  Let me hear it.  You're such a liar.  Let me enjoy this, okay? 
[00:24:00]  Okay, no, I'm really looking forward to it.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  We refuse to be responsible.  We refuse to be responsible.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  Well, we got the Kaz in the studio.  The Kaz.  And also, live from L.A., it's Jay Moore.  Jay.  First weekly visit.  What's up, Jay?  I don't know how Kaz could be in the studio when he's here at my house.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Put him on the phone. 
[00:24:30]  Well, he's in the other room.  Kaz.  Oh, no.  I'm here on the phone.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Pick up the other line.  Now, I would like to talk to you about my penis.

[00:25:30]  down his pants yeah that's great did you read the story in L.A. Jay? No. I'm still on comic  time I'm sleeping till once. Oh this is a great story. Lachelle Covington she's been on the Cosby  show a few times. Lachelle. It's Lachelle. Lachelle. I don't know how to pronounce these  names. Lachelle. She's got Ricky Lake with that name. Lachelle. Lachelle. She's got Ricky Lake  name. Yeah she's been on the. Lachelle when did you and Rat Tatooine know Latrine was DeBree's 
[00:26:00]  baby. Well when I talk to Listerine. Hold on Kalua it's Portia's turn. LaMondula. LaMondula.  Anfernee please. Anfernee. Anfernee. What was the thing? Well she's an actress. She's been  on the Cosby show but she hasn't had speaking parts on the Cosby show. I wonder why. Well  she went to Cos's little house there. To his townhouse. To his townhouse to get some acting  advice. Acting advice on the Cos. That seems a little strange right there. That's the best. 
[00:26:30]  She goes to his house for a little acting advice. She's a hooah. A hooah. Well she filed a police  report saying the beloved comedian put her hand under his t-shirt and guided it south toward  his sweatshirt. That's a crime? Filted with lawn. What law did he break? You see the penis  is below the belt line so Andy wanted her to touch the penis. I put your hand on my belly 
[00:27:00]  bar. I was hoping it would not stay where I put it. What law did you break? I was guiding  her hand towards what I like to call Fat Albert. Well sometimes when I drink too much it's Donald.  Fat Albert and the Cosby kids hanging right below him. I like to call my left nut Rudy and my right  nut Bill. Rudy hangs a little lower cause he's sad about being below Fat Albert. Pow. If you're 
[00:27:30]  too groody just right the next thing you know. Pow Fat Albert starts dripping and drizzling all the  little wishes. Hey Jay I think Cosby wanted to play What's in My Pants huh? Yeah right. I say  Polarack was an afro, slightly shaved, and she dates a fireman because it has a brass knob. 
[00:28:00]  And what law did he break?  Well, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, they decide no crime had been committed.  She pulled her hand away, and at that point, before that point, it was a consensual little circumstance.  So the cops never questioned Cosby.  However, the story gets better there, Jay Moore.  Oh, now she's going to sue him.  In the upcoming issue of the National Enquirer, Covington's relatives are quoted saying Cosby went further grabbing her breasts, 
[00:28:30]  trying to put his hand down her pants, and exposing himself to the young actor.  If that's the case, this crime's going on on a daily basis right here in this studio.  I was just going to say, it's a disaster.  It's alarming.  Anthony and I think of the same joke, like a 60% clip.  And it's like just 50-50, who gets it out first?  It's alarming.  You want to hear more of the police report, because it is pretty funny. 
[00:29:00]  But I don't understand what, putting a woman's hand on your belly.  What is a woman's hand on your pants?  You know how many times, you know what my trick was when you didn't think you were getting anywhere?  Yeah.  This works, guys.  Any guy listening, this is a great one.  There we go.  There we go.  More advice.  Batten down the hatches.  More advice.  M-O-H-R advice.  Okay.  Hey, come on.  This is the guy that came up with, I made two cousins kiss.  Don't forget.  Absolutely.  We'll never forget it.  All right.  When you're in the car making out, and you're like touching breast, and you're not sure what's  going to happen, and you just, you know, you could sit there until five in the morning 
[00:29:30]  making out.  Yeah.  You don't want that.  Yeah.  I mean, time, expedition is the key.  You want to be expeditious in the process of getting laid.  Right.  Because you're making out, and when you feel, don't just do it like right off the bat.  You've got to get it like hot and heavy.  You touch the breast, tweak in the nipples a little.  Then you take out, it's got to be erect, gentlemen.  Don't take out the acorn.  Take out the rod.  Yeah.  And you just let them see it.  You say, what are we going to do about this?  When they see it, sometimes when they see it, it's like, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
[00:30:00]  They can't help it.  Yeah.  They're at least going to touch it out of curiosity, because they can't believe you.  The worst thing that's going to happen is they're going to make, you know, kick you out  of the car.  And then who wants to be able to do it anyway?  That's a break.  Like, it's a problem, though.  What are we going to do about this?  That's a break.  Yeah, oh, look.  You know what that's what you do?  You're like, oh, my God.  Look how excited you get me.  Show them.  Oh.  It's like it's a compliment.  That's a brave move, Jay.  That is a bold move, man.  And I'm telling you it works, because when they see it, well, I don't know about, well, 
[00:30:30]  not Rick, because he's an egg roll, but when they see most, you know, nice, handsome, circumcised  penises, you know, they like penises.  But if Rick takes out, like, an egg roll, they're going to be like, I don't know about  that one there.  Why don't you peel it yourself and get back to me?  I love the girls in the car.  You're making out with them and stuff, and you want to go for patch, and they have all  those karate moves preventing you from getting down there.  Yeah.  I didn't realize their arms can move like that.  Yeah, that's like, uh, they do their special. 
[00:31:00]  I've been on the road.  What are we going to do about this?  Now, enter the question, and I suppose, at about 1.15 a.m., what are we going to do  about my erect penis?  It looks like a Jell-O pudding pop on it.  Oh, there you go.  Oh, don't you treat it like what?  Right here, here, here.  It's a little barn and full.  You're not talking.  Rudy never minded putting her hand down Macazza's pants during the cotton store. 
[00:31:30]  Little Rudy.  Rudy.  What a great story in the paper, isn't it?  Why did a 60-year-old girl have a mustache?  Rudy had a little Dirty Sanchez going.  I can't believe a 65-year-old man trying to get pussy is news.  It's a 20-year-old chick, and he's like putting his hand down.  Yeah, but what else do you do when you're worth a billion dollars and you're 65 years old? 
[00:32:00]  You'd think he could be a little smoother than that, though.  He's in his swank townhouse in his big, stinky, Cosby sweatpants.  Repeat that.  With his big belly.  Repeat the first part of your sentence.  He's in his posh townhouse?  Yeah, she came to him.  Yeah, that's true.  But I mean, you could...  Backing advice.  You know what, though?  If he probably would have had just a tad more class, it would have worked.  What, did he kiss her on the mouth?  I don't know.  I don't know what to move is, but I don't think it's grab her hand and put it in your pants. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, Jay, what's the move?  I told you what to move is you make out when it's fully erect.  Take it out.  What are you going to do about it?  You're stroking it yourself and say, look how excited you make me.  What are we going to do about it?  It's crazy.  Look at this.  Oh, my God, I'm in pain.  I'm in pain.  What are we going to do about this?  It just sounds like a problem.  It's so funny.  What are we going to...  Oh, look at this.  Geez, I've got to take this back to the shop.  What are we going to do about this? 
[00:33:00]  No, then you start doing it yourself, and they're like, then they feel stupid that they're just sitting there watching you masturbate.  You know what, it's powerful hockey.  Take it from the man.  Brilliant.  Brilliant move.  Somebody's going to try that move.  Bravo.  You know what's funny is, Opie's going to try it on his girlfriend, like, where he doesn't even have to try it.  What are we going to do?  Opie will be like making out tonight and just take it out and be like, oh, what are we going to do about this?  Put that away.  You're disgusting.  Put it in me.  What are you talking about?  I'm going to try the, what are we going to do about this line?  I encourage all our listeners to try the, what are we going to do about this line? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah, try it.  Let us know how it works, you single guy.  It's got to be like, oh, my God, you're in so much pain because it's supposed to be out of your pants.  Hold on.  This girl, this girl, Kelly, says this trick works.  Yes, she.  I'm going to put you on with Kelly, Jack.  And it's strong.  Kelly.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  Lovely.  Great.  It does work.  Really?  Because when you see a good-looking penis, you want to take care of it.  It is so true.  And I can tell you from experience, it's very true.  It has happened many a times.  From the way you're talking, it sounds like you're doing one right now. 
[00:34:00]  No.  Actually, right now, I'm on my way to work.  I'm going to, like, deep s*** with my boss.  Oops.  Oh, watch that curse word.  Sorry, but I'm really...  Go cursing.  You can't curse.  Hey, Kelly.  Kelly.  What are we going to do about this?  I don't know.  I have to come visit.  I guess you have to be in the same room, right, Jay?  It works better when you're there with the person.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah?  Why does it work?  It's because you see it, and you're already excited, and the sight of it makes you want to do something about it.  If you're making out for, like, five hours, and you haven't done that yet, you're in serious problems, okay? 
[00:34:30]  But I'm thinking after an hour of making out, you should be doing it by then, okay?  Or less than an hour.  Cool.  When you see it fully erect, you almost feel guilty for the...  When the guy starts stroking it himself, you're going to be like, all right, get out of the way.  Let me do it.  You don't chop right away.  I've got to talk to them for a while.  Chalk it up.  I'm going in.  It works, though.  All right, Kelly.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Well, look at that. 
[00:35:00]  How drunk was that girl?  This girl, Joanne, says that your trick works.  One more lady that says the Jane Moore trick works.  You know, you guys didn't believe me when I unveiled the trick.  No, I didn't.  That's a ballsy move.  Joanne.  Hello.  Hi.  All right, Jay.  That trick has worked so many times on me, it's not even funny.  Wow.  You know, tell everybody.  So many times.  Your uncles are going to start pulling it out.  So, what, you're making out with a guy, you're getting hot and heavy, he pulls out his junk  and says, what are we going to do about it?  And it works for you, huh?  And let me tell you, it's like, okay, I'll be a good girl tomorrow. 
[00:35:30]  Wow.  You know, you go along, you're going to say, you're saying, I'm going to behave myself.  No, this is not going any further.  Yeah.  I'm going to remain calm.  We're just going to end the night nicely tonight.  It's going to be good.  I'm going to be, oh, oh, oh, oh.  He takes it out, and the next thing you know, it's just irresistible.  That's right.  It's a beautiful sight.  It truly is.  Some filth and blood.  I told you when they see it.  See, guys don't realize that it's actually an attractive thing to women. 
[00:36:00]  It is a weapon.  Yeah.  Well, that was a storyline episode 54 when I taught Theo that trick.  He went out and pulled out his stuff.  Filth and barn.  Put your hand down the big sweaty sweatpants of the cause.  Filth and barn.  I applaud the cause.  I think if you're a billionaire, and you work as hard as he has, as long as he has, and a  girl comes to your house, and you put her hand on your belly, your big old belly, and 
[00:36:30]  tell her to take care of some business, I think he's done nothing wrong.  And I think this country's gone bananas.  Where do you draw the line between sexual harassment and trying to get laid?  What if he's just trying to get laid?  Yeah, but you know something?  She came over to your house.  She went for acting advice.  She honestly knew what the deal was.  I'm just saying a little more couth.  Maybe she didn't right away want to plunge down at his 60-year-old.  Couth.  60-year-old.  Ugly poor guys need couth.  Melted Turkish caffeine nuts. 
[00:37:00]  A billion dollars.  You don't need couth.  You pull down your pants and go, hey, play with this.  I'm worth a billion.  I own the little rascals.  I own the little rascals.  I want you to grab my buckwheat.  You need her.  Look, my little stymie is out here.  You're it. </pre>
