<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of recent election results.  The hosts focused on Bloomberg's re-election as New York City mayor, criticizing his "femmy" and "swishy" voice, and Chris Christie's victory in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, also receiving negative commentary.  They calculated Bloomberg's exorbitant campaign spending per vote and noted the Republican gains in other races, including Virginia.  The hosts extensively mocked Boston Mayor Menino's public speaking skills, replaying and analyzing awkward phrases from his victory speech, including a potentially misheard "them, them, rape."  The discussion then transitioned to Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin hosting the Oscars, followed by a debate on why successful stand-up comedians often move to acting, using Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, and Jim Carrey as examples.  A significant portion of the show revolved around a video of a woman, believed to be Jodie Sweetin, with the hosts focusing on a specific flattering photo and one host’s apparent fixation on her breasts.  The show also included discussion of video games *Tropico* and *Modern Warfare 2*, and a highly critical analysis of a close local election in Nassau County, focusing on the influence of a third-party candidate.

The show continued with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton discussing the Democratic party's poor performance in gubernatorial races.  This segued into a graphic and racially charged discussion of a Cleveland serial killer with at least ten bodies found in his home.  This section included crude jokes and a parody song of Jay-Z's "Empire State of Mind" by Kenny.  The hosts then discussed child pornography, the disturbing issue of police officers downloading such material, and a caller from Cleveland's perspective on the serial killer case, referencing Jeffrey Dahmer. The segment included personal anecdotes, such as Jim Norton's childhood accidental killing of a salamander, leading to a discussion on accidental versus intentional violence, animal abuse, childhood bullies, and pets.  The hosts also discussed Gary Glitter's conviction and the harsh punishments for child abuse in Saudi Arabia, including beheadings and crucifixions.  They briefly mentioned an upcoming hockey game and Jim Norton's meeting with Reggie Jackson, concluding with conversation about Jackson's appearance, Bono's comments on rock music, and one host's hearing loss.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to listener calls detailing unusual and often sexually explicit experiences involving animals.  This was sparked by a news story about correctional officers charged with animal cruelty for allegedly sexually stimulating their police dog.  The ensuing conversation covered various animal-related sexual acts, with listeners sharing anecdotes about masturbating dogs, horses, bulls, and pigs.  The discussion included historical practices like pelvic massage for "hysteria," described as therapeutic masturbation.  Callers shared experiences with aggressive dogs, and a canine officer called in to debunk the sexual stimulation training claim.  Further calls detailed bizarre jobs involving artificial insemination of dogs and horse breeding.  A research biologist even called, listing the numerous animals he’d masturbated for his work, including giraffes, kangaroos, and koalas, providing graphic details.  The segment ended with a discussion of listener dreams, including one host's dream involving a nurse and a blood pressure cuff on his erection, and various interpretations offered by callers.  Upcoming guests for the next few days were announced as Bill Burr, Dane Cook, and Bob Kelly.


The following segment started with a discussion of listener dream interpretations, including bizarre dreams recounted by Opie and Anthony, and analysis using a dream interpretation website.  Listeners shared surreal and humorous dreams. One caller, John from Connecticut, emotionally recounted dreams involving his son, killed in Iraq in 2006, which led to a discussion about grief and the emotional impact of losing a child. This transitioned to a discussion of the Westboro Baptist Church, prompted by John’s encounter with a member who expressed gladness at his son's death.  The hosts and callers expressed disgust and anger towards the group, with callers sharing negative experiences with their protests.  The segment continued with discussion of the Westboro Baptist Church's tactics and motivations, and Jim Norton’s marmalade naming contest.


The final segment focused on listener calls and reactions to Westboro Baptist Church protests, particularly one near a Marine's funeral. The hosts brainstormed ways to counter-protest, ranging from playful disruption to more aggressive, unacted-upon ideas.  A Marine caller described the tension and restraint required when facing the protesters.  The conversation included crude and offensive language.  The hosts also discussed upcoming stand-up comedy appearances and a cancelled guest appearance, along with banter about other comedians and competing radio shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road! 
[00:00:30]  Why is it so loud? Oh my god! Holy crap!  I just got, I just started getting overly excited because it was so loud.  It's not me! Somebody in the booth!  Turn that shit down!  You sound like our parents. 
[00:01:00]  Turn that shit down!  Turn that down! It's too goddamn early.  I was just going to give some bullet points.  You got Jimmy meeting Reggie. This is the stuff we're going to talk about today.  You got Bloomberg basically buying the election and changing the rules,  so we got to continue with him as the mayor of New York City.  Yeah.  But he barely won.  They kicked Corzine out of office in Jersey there.  Bye-bye.  And, of course, the Yankees are going to win the World Series today, right, Ed? 
[00:01:30]  I'm not saying anything. I'd say they're going to play a good game.  Philly's a tough team, but we're going to go in there, you know, and win this one.  I'm just going to watch the fucking thing and bite my nails and wonder.  No, no, Pettit's the perfect pitcher for this game.  Oh, leave Pettit alone.  He is good after a loss, though.  Pettit's a very good stop the bleeding guy.  I mean, he's a good guy.  But then again, when they needed him in fucking, that was after three straight wins.  I say when they needed him against Arizona, he fell apart and lost 15-1, I think. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, well, I know.  Say hello to Game 7, boys.  Shut up!  Say hello to Game 7.  And Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin will be the Oscar co-hosts.  Steve Martin's a funny fucking Oscar host.  Until he comes out as...  It's hilarious.  Yeah, honestly.  You know what?  He's going to come out in an Inspector Clouseau get-up.  I bet they make him do that.  Hello?  I am Inspector Clouseau.  And you'll go and throw something to your TV.  If he does that, he'll still make fun of it. 
[00:02:30]  Like, I have to say, as an Oscar host, he makes me laugh harder than most of them do.  Really?  Yeah, Steve Martin...  Now, that's a surprise.  His Clouseau impression annoyed me.  He's a funny fucking guy as far as...  Are you reading a script for a Steve Martin movie or something?  Something must have happened where Jimmy has a relationship now.  Did you have lunch with Steve Martin?  No.  A middleman?  Yeah, something's going on.  Someone's agent talking to someone.  Are you going to play Steve Martin's son in a movie?  Are you going to be little Clouseau?  Little Clouseau?  Oh, what an asshole. 
[00:03:00]  Well, you're trying on mustaches yesterday.  I didn't sell out.  I did not sell out.  Why, Inspector Clouseau would have a 41-year-old son.  I think he was trying on mustaches yesterday.  Something changed with Jimmy, you fuck.  No, he...  King Tut.  All right, not my favorite.  What?  He's showing King Tut.  He likes Steve Martin, though.  There you go.  As a stand-up, he was funny.  And his Oscar stuff is...  He's a really funny dude when he's just kind of standing there being shitty.  Why do these great stand-ups just completely blow off the stand-up? 
[00:03:30]  Steve Martin's stand-up, you make a good point.  A stand-up was really good for the time.  He says that it's because he says the Late Show Friday, which sends a lot of comedians  packing.  It's like you get tired, I guess, of just of the fucking stress that comes with it when  you can make movies where everybody treats you like a king for fucking eight million bucks  or whatever it was, five million, and now he's probably making 20 million.  When you want to see Eddie Murphy on a fucking comedy stage one more time, when was the  last time he did stand-up for real?  Let me think about it.  Maybe. 
[00:04:00]  God, the worst thing would be seeing him get up there and just fucking bomb.  Oh, that's true, too.  Not be good.  Like, you remember Delirious and Raw and shit like that.  But these guys, they blow off the stand-up when they hit in Hollywood.  Too much money.  Jim Carrey's a good example, too.  I think it's just simply too much money.  It's like the amount of money these guys get for films.  It's like, you know.  A lot of stand-up comics, you know, there's an exception like Jerry Seinfeld, who just  genuinely likes doing it.  Yeah, he is.  A lot of these comics want that as a springboard to movies and other shit. 
[00:04:30]  It's here.  You know, we have enough of these fucking guys in here where they're like, oh, my God,  if I just to get off the fucking road and do movies or something like that.  You know, there are some people that genuinely like it.  I think Jimmy absolutely loves doing it.  But, you know, some of them just like, get me the fuck out of there, get me in movies  or TV, and I'm done.  But Jimmy's now working with Steve Martin, so it's just a matter of time.  Yeah, apparently.  Steve Martin's a genius and funny as hell. 
[00:05:00]  He had one of the funniest Oscar lines I ever heard.  It was when they do the montage of people who died, and they do the death montage, and  Steve Martin said, coming up next, we're going to show you a bunch of people you thought  were dead but aren't.  All right, that's good.  I think that's fucking hilarious.  And they should do that.  A complete...  Great line, but then do the bit.  Don't take yourself so seriously in Hollywood.  Do the bit!  So, Anthony, I go to you first because, you know, you're the political guy.  I'm the political correspondent.  Well, Jimmy, a close second.  Jimmy, a close second. 
[00:05:30]  I think co-anchor.  Me, a very distant third.  A very distant third.  Oh, he's lost complete faith in the system.  He's an anarchist.  I think it's all horse shit in the end.  It's all hokum.  It really is.  It's all hokum.  So, why don't you run us down some of the interesting races they're in?  Well, white is very interesting.  White versus black is always number one.  What's number two, though?  He says, uh, white.  What's number two? 
[00:06:00]  The second interesting race.  Uh, let's see.  Whites versus blacks will always be number one.  Jesus!  You can't say that.  Well, we're talking about race wars.  Oh, the race war.  Yes!  Oh.  Who do you think would take sides with who?  Like, with Whitey?  No.  With the next in line?  No, the next, quote, race war.  Two groups of people that hate each other.  That equal black and white.  I shouldn't even say hate. 
[00:06:30]  Just don't get along would be a much better way to put it.  Israeli and, uh, you know, any other Middle Eastern people.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  That's kind of different.  That's biggie.  Yeah.  That's more of a local thing, though.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a local little scuffle.  It's a bit more local.  What's going on?  Because you don't see that, uh, you don't see, you know, rocks being thrown in New York  City.  Uh, no.  That would be interesting.  And there were a lot of, there's a lot of Palestinians that live in New York City, right?  People just heaving rocks at each other.  Anyway, so what do you got?  Bloomberg?  Yeah, Bloomberg.  Bloomberg won, and, um, he won by a lot smaller margin, something like four points. 
[00:07:00]  He spent a boatload of cash.  How much did he spend?  Hundreds of millions of his own money.  Hundreds of millions.  Yeah, of his own money, uh, and, uh, he pretty much, you know, bought, bought the office.  And even with spending all that money, his opponent, who was that, Thompson or Tom, Thompson  or something, he's another Democrat who gives a shit.  But, uh, he lost, uh, by, you know, barely, uh, anything. 
[00:07:30]  And he didn't spend, uh, anywhere near it.  The amount that, uh, Bloomberg spent.  Nope, nope.  They, uh, so, and Bloomberg's on there going, if you like what we've done in the past eight  years, just wait till you see what we, it's just, you ain't seen nothing yet.  And now that he's been in office eight years, has he decided he doesn't have to sound tough  anymore?  Oh, that he can put on that effeminate voice.  He's sounding, really stick with it.  He's sounding very, uh, swishy.  Very femmy. 
[00:08:00]  Very swishy.  He's always sounded a little femmy.  There's always been speculation as to his, um, sexual orientation.  People have always speculated, uh, which way Mike goes.  But he sounds, uh, a bit, uh, swishier.  Yeah, yeah.  As the years go by.  A little swishier now?  Like he's, he's letting his guard down.  He's gonna be.  I'm Mayor Bloomberg and I want to recruit you.  Right.  We give him a few more years.  He's gonna sound like Nathan Lane.  He's gonna assist me.  Oh, I'm a mayor. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, he goes.  Yeah.  Uh, if you, if you like the progress you've seen in the past eight years, you ain't seen  nothing yet, which can only mean every street in New York city is going to be closed down  and turned into a bicycle path or a, uh, fucking mall or something.  More taxes.  Uh, whatever.  I guess it's better than having the Democrat in there.  I don't know.  I don't live in New York.  I work here.  I apparently pay taxes that are far reaching beyond the borders of New York city.  Thank you very much. 
[00:09:00]  But, uh, we're stuck with at least four more years of this motherfucker till he gets the  end of this term and says, Hey, I want to stay in here a little longer.  Yeah.  And then buys that too.  Screw city taxes.  Uh, I have to pay building taxes.  Yeah.  I call it a building tax.  It is a building tax.  I live in a condo that I supposedly own here in New York city, but, but I just wrote a check  for $2,400.  That's my monthly maintenance charge to live in this building.  So how am I supposed to ever make money off my condo? 
[00:09:30]  I call it a building tax.  That's a mortgage to people.  Yeah.  A big time mortgage.  That's a fucking mortgage.  No, that's just my maintenance charge.  That's just maintenance, which is now officially called my building tax.  And I write that in my memo building tax.  Cause which, which is pretty much a, a doorman.  Yeah.  And, um, what a shoot that your garbage goes down.  Like what, what, what else is there?  Sounds like you lived in New York.  Oh, I've lived in Brooklyn.  Yeah.  You get the doorman thing.  Who cares?  Like the guy runs to open the door for me every day. 
[00:10:00]  I don't care.  I can open my own door.  I can do that.  When he's not around, if he followed you everywhere and opened every door now, all right.  And every once in a while.  That might justify it.  Every once in a while they go, Mr. Hughes, you got a package?  Can we bring it up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you know what?  I can go down and get it.  Who cares?  I got it.  I'm on the motherfucker.  I mean, for $2,400 a month, I think I should get a lot more.  You should bring it up and fucking bow.  Keep the old package, sir.  Let me think about it.  What else do I get for my building tax?  I think that's it.  Yeah.  Oh, and they say if a guest is there. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You got, uh, Mr. Kumia.  Yeah.  Right.  Like that would ever happen.  I think I've been razzed.  That's called a doorbell though.  Isn't that called a doorbell?  Well, they make sure, they make sure people just don't come up to your, yeah, that's their  job.  I mean, they got security, you know, I don't know.  It's just, it's a building tax.  Yeah.  So getting back to it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, he, he's, he's in, but like I said, a lot shorter or a lot smaller margin, uh, than  they thought.  Boy, did he spend a lot of bucks and he just squeaked by Spicoli. 
[00:11:00]  He squeaked by.  Somebody did the math, Ant, and it sounds, if this is right, uh, Bloomberg paid $157 per vote.  But yeah, anyone could run for office.  That's John G in Lexington.  Is that true?  Good luck.  Is that math about right?  Probably.  Wow.  Probably.  Wow.  And, uh, the big, the big race in Jersey.  Wow.  That was Corazine and, uh, Christie.  Now, just for the people that don't live anywhere close to Jersey, Corazine, uh, yeah, he was 
[00:11:30]  running and, uh, he had, he had Obama on his side.  Obama was coming to town every other week.  He made three visits to try to pump this fucker up.  Uh, what, what Corazine did in four years, aside from almost kill himself in that fucking,  uh, car wreck he was in when he first got elected, is, uh, overtax the shit out of New  Jersey.  People, uh, obviously were completely disgusted with what this guy did. 
[00:12:00]  Um, and then his, his, his re-election campaign ads about lowering taxes, what, the ones you  raised, you talk to anyone from Jersey, they can't, they can't afford to live there.  How did he expect to win?  Uh, after taxing the shit out of, out of everybody.  It was his pompous, I got Obama on my side, Democrats, he still thought this wave of, uh,  of, uh, being a Democrat was going to still be sweeping over the nation a year after Obama  was elected and, uh, you know something, Obama just didn't have the power to get some of 
[00:12:30]  these key Democrats elected that they thought he'd have.  The vote wasn't out there.  There weren't people clamoring to, to vote for Corazine because Obama said so.  Because Obama said so.  Well, there was a picture in the paper I showed you.  It was a split.  Yep.  It was a, it was a picture of last year said for change, meaning everyone, you know,  coming out to vote for Obama.  For Obama.  And it was just a sea of people.  And then, uh, the picture right next to it, the same voting area, uh, for status quo. 
[00:13:00]  And they showed three, maybe four people.  Yeah.  It's kind of walking up to the voting booths.  It is an off year for an election.  It's not even a midterm election.  So it's not really that fair, I guess.  But the thing is, the real dopes come out on these off year elections and, eh, I don't  know.  Uh, I don't think they quite understand some of the stuff going on.  Back to the $157 per vote.  That's on nydailynews.com.  Thank you, John G.  Oh.  So that's what Bloomberg spent.  Per vote. 
[00:13:30]  That's what it comes down to.  Yeah.  That's, uh, is that really the way it's supposed to work?  No.  I mean, the city's going broke and, and he wants to be mayor.  Why doesn't he just like use his money to solve the problems?  Yeah.  If he's going to use his money just to be reelected.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There you go.  Why not?  Use the money.  That's what he did to get elected.  And then he gets paid like a dollar a year or something.  Like some kind of funny, like, okay, the mayor gets paid a dollar a year.  For real?  Yeah.  For real.  Then how does he live?  He does.  But he's a multi-billionaire. 
[00:14:00]  No, I know that.  But if it was some other Joe Schmo, how do they live on a dollar a year?  Well, I think they make the real check.  Bloomberg decided, I don't need the money that the mayor's usually paid.  So he just takes a dollar a year or something like that.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Oh, Bloomberg made that deal.  Bloomberg decided, I don't need the money.  Just put it back in the till.  That would be crazy for me to take his salary is what he's saying because he's a billionaire.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks very silly for him to take, he's listed as the eighth richest American with a net worth of $16 billion. 
[00:14:30]  Why the fuck does he want to be mayor?  $16 billion.  It's a power thing with him.  It really is.  And I think it proves the point that he went for a third term.  Like, why would you do that?  Because he would just be walking around going, I don't know.  Do I like this girl?  Do I like this guy?  What am I doing?  If I had $16 billion, I would just go live in the Caribbean and build some ridiculous over-the-top house.  He loves the power. 
[00:15:00]  And never leave.  He loves the business angle of the whole thing, I think.  He loves butting heads with people.  He's bored.  That's what he is.  He's bored.  He's bored.  He's bored.  He's playing.  This is how he plays.  Yeah.  I'll run a city.  Like Tropico.  Yeah, this is fucking...  This is real-life Tropico.  That's what he's playing, Tropico.  He's playing SimCity.  Is Tropico too old?  I remember Tropico.  I like Tropico.  Ah, there's Tropico.  And Presidente, your people grow hungry.  Fuck them. 
[00:15:30]  Build more prisons.  I lost that game in record time every time I played because I took all the dissenters and  just built prisons and threw them in there or killed them.  I loved Tropico.  And they would always revolt on me.  Who would actually play Tropico or The Sims the right way?  I know.  Who cares?  Well, my ex did.  What, the right way?  Yeah, she actually...  That's boring.  Dude, she built, like, schools and things and educated the people and farms and was playing  for days and got to the, like, highest point you could get in the game. 
[00:16:00]  No dissension, nothing.  And I would play for half an hour and I'm already having to execute people that, like,  aren't thinking my way.  I'm like, alright.  Chop their fucking heads off.  Throw them in prisons.  My whole island, half of it was, like, covered with prisons.  Right.  And then they just, you know...  I would play Tropico and I would try to start building up the island and I would go, what's  that little commotion over there?  Yeah, what's that?  I'm like, eh, I don't need a paycheck.  I'm building things.  And it's some little fucker yelling and screaming trying to rally the troops. 
[00:16:30]  He's got no food and no water.  They're fucking...  He's running from hut to hut and I'm like, ah, I'm not going to bother them.  I'll get pipes over there eventually for your water, you little fuckers.  I'm busy.  Because I just wanted cool stuff.  Yeah.  That's all.  You want the stuff that looks cool on the island.  You can get, like, a sports arena or something, right?  Yeah, shit like that after a while.  I got a sports arena and, you know, the island had no money, but, man, it looked cool.  They're broke.  They grow hungry.  El Presidente.  Your people.  They have no homes. 
[00:17:00]  Fuck them.  Put them in prison.  Do they still make Tropico?  Tropico 3 coming out when?  Next week.  Next week.  For real?  The 9th for PC and January for Xbox 360.  I'm going to fucking get Tropico 3.  I know.  I'm going to check out Tropico 3 for a couple of days because that Modern Warfare comes out  on the 11th, I think, right?  Yeah.  No, actually, I think Modern Warfare comes out first.  Really?  I think it comes out the same day, I think.  The 9th.  Travis might know this.  It's Tuesday, right?  It comes out Tuesday, yeah.  Tuesday?  Well, yeah.  Psyched!  Modern Warfare 2 and Tropico 3. 
[00:17:30]  Fucking A.  Tropico 3.  Come on.  I'm on it.  So, all right.  So, you got Bloomberg barely winning.  Corzine got his ass kicked out.  Yeah, he got kicked out and Chris Christie's in there now.  And, boy, this guy's got four years to become a speaker.  Because he's really bad.  Tomorrow, we start making Jersey a place where families can live.  Tomorrow, we start making Jersey a place where our friends may live.  Tomorrow, we start...  Shut up!  Oh, Chris Christie? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Oh, is he a dullard?  I sat in the dressing room with him and Hannity.  I had no idea who he was.  Really?  I'm like, who's the fat guy?  That's what they were calling him, yeah.  I really wish I would have...  Of course, now all I'm thinking of is Greg.  There's one I could have had a shot with and just ignored.  Don't worry, Jersey.  You're not losing a governor.  You're gaining a ton.  I sat back there talking to creepy Dick Morris.  Oh, is he a fucking ghoul?  Is he a fruit?  Dude, he's awful.  He should be sitting on the top of a library just fucking...  Nyeh.  A little fucking...  Nyeh. 
[00:18:30]  What a creep.  With that voice.  Let me tell you, Sean.  Oh, is he unpleasant?  It's just doom and gloom out.  Nyeh.  Christie...  Yeah, Christie won.  Wow.  We have some first lady governor there.  What's her name?  What do they call her?  First lady of Jersey or something?  The wife?  The first twat.  Oh, wow.  I didn't know they changed it to that.  Yeah, they did.  Let me just say two things about his wife.  Yee. 
[00:19:00]  Ooh.  Oh, I'm going to see a picture now.  That's all.  That's it.  Can I see a picture?  Pretty gal?  Yee.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was up on stage.  It was like, wow.  Not a looker?  Uh, nah.  Nah.  Compare her to Jodie Sweetin.  Stop it.  From Full House.  Have you just been thinking of Jodie Sweetin all night?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ever since she left. 
[00:19:30]  I think the listeners have, too.  Yeah.  If I have to read another tweet from a fucking guy that said he jerked off to Jodie Sweetin pictures.  Dude, you tweeted one of the best pictures she's ever taken.  I know.  It's amazing.  It's fucking stunning.  She pushed her boobs out.  Oh, it was perfect.  It's on my Twitter.  I don't even have to promote it because I think everyone checked out the picture.  That one did very well.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  Uh, she pushed those big freaking fake boobs out.  Oh, the video isn't as good because it was more like a hidden camera shit. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, her fucking, uh, the mics.  Although, what people liked about, look at that picture.  That is, that is a fucking amazing picture.  She, Opie went, Opie said, he goes, hey, can I get a picture of you?  She goes, okay.  And then she, she, like, pushed her hip out a little, put her hand on her side like I'm a little teapot, short and stout.  And then put her hand on the chair and gave, like, a great smile and pushed her titties out.  Oh, yeah.  Everyone was commenting, like, there's no way that jacket zips up. 
[00:20:30]  No.  What they liked about the video, it was more like, kind of, I just put the fucking flip down.  So, I didn't really, I don't know, whatever.  It's okay.  But, uh, they liked that Jimmy was staring at her tits.  Oh, is that what?  Ha, ha, the video?  Was I?  Was I?  It's uncontrollable for you.  It's uncontrollable.  I didn't mean to.  You can't.  The perv switch was ready to go off, I swear to God.  Here, play the video.  We don't even, we don't even have to play the audio.  I want to see how many times you see Jimmy look at her.  Jimmy look at her tits? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  It's on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio.  There's two, there's three.  There's three.  All right, wait, play the audio.  Start over.  Start over.  Fuck it.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  The drunk was, well, no, the first time I got drunk was, I was probably about 14.  I mean, I probably had a sip of alcohol here and there, but really nothing, I mean, not anything.  Jimmy is trying not to look, but he's just.  Oh, really? 
[00:21:30]  You're trying to be so casual about it.  That was a red wine.  Like, I just started pulling.  You missed what?  At the table.  My mom was, like, way across the table.  You're not even listening to her, Jimmy.  You have no idea what she's saying.  That's not good.  Who held your hair when you threw?  Yeah, that one.  This is great.  You can play this at home. 
[00:22:00]  All right, Jimmy looked away, finally.  Hey, what was that about?  Every time he looks back, he looks out.  Yeah.  You know what, though? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, my God.  Did I stare at her?  It goes on forever.  You got to.  This is less than two minutes into a five-minute clip.  Like, I mean, all of the.  It was just, you know.  All right, he looked up and then down.  I was 26.  26.  He's looking in her eyes right now.  He's looking in her eyes.  We got married.  Ooh.  All right, Tom, look out.  There's a split second.  There it is.  It's like 17 months total, our relationship.  Yeah.  Wow.  Whoa. 
[00:23:00]  Look away.  Look back.  Kids.  Right.  That was a double.  Fucking Jimmy, man.  It just started her kids the whole time.  It's terrible.  We have to get her out.  Yeah.  You're all in the coats on.  Where are you going next?  I can't see his eyes, so I'm assuming.  Yeah.  All right.  You get the point.  It goes on forever.  Holy shit.  That's really funny.  Oh, my God.  But who can blame you?  Look at them, and they were right next to him.  Who thought she'd fucking grow up that high? 
[00:23:30]  She had fun with us, by the way.  Sam ran into her later in the afternoon.  She had a great time.  That's a good angle for your video right there.  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to get a tripod, because it's hard to try to do the radio show and film shit.  You just put it set up there.  That's good.  Yeah.  Just set it up on Jimmy's back when these girls come in.  Get it?  Tripod?  Big dick.  You fucking got a hard on.  All right.  I actually didn't get it.  That's a long way to go.  Did you get a video of Brett and Sharon when they were in? 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  That was a fucking fun one.  Yeah.  A little taste.  That was fun.  A little taste of the Susan Boyle stuff.  Oh, God.  Jason in Pennsylvania.  Jason.  Yo, Opie.  What's up, man?  Hey, brother.  Jimmy, I was down at the Bregada.  They're pushing that show.  I want to get down and see it, man.  Nice.  I hope it goes well for you.  Oh, good.  But yeah, I'm there.  It's 15, 16.  How are tickets?  I don't know.  The pizza, they're going actually very well.  I usually sell out there.  That's a perfect time to go to the Bregada in Atlantic City.  Martin Luther King.  Oh, fucking yeah.  What do you got, Jason? 
[00:24:30]  Well, I was just commenting on the elections.  I mean, I live in Pennsylvania, wife, two kids, just a regular Joe working every day.  I mean, these guys in politics are so out of the loop.  There's no rhyme or reason the amount of money they spend.  And to be quite honest with you, from my perspective, nobody really gives a crap anymore.  Yeah.  Well, Opie said it.  You know, the system's broke.  No one wants to fucking fix it.  It's all business as usual. 
[00:25:00]  And, you know, you hope something's going to change or somebody's going to make some kind of difference.  But the system in place is, like, really fucked up.  They put just Band-Aids on problems now.  Yeah.  That's all.  You know, you guys hit the nail on the head with that Chris Christie.  That guy, if he can make governor, I can win the presidency, man.  He is unbelievable.  Is he a dullard?  Watching him was just really...  God, I've got to hear audio of him now.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Well, listen, guys.  Punching out.  Thanks a lot. 
[00:25:30]  Talk to you later.  All right.  Because the commercials for him weren't bad.  Because, you know, they've got to pump it up.  It's kind of like Hollywood.  Yeah.  But I want to see him just talking as a regular Jew.  A regular Jew.  Another big race for me was the Nassau County executive.  Whoa!  Excitement!  What does he do?  Tom Swazee.  What does Tom Swazee do?  Apparently, he raises the fucking shit out of our taxes in Nassau County.  That's the wife. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  Yeah, that's Chris Christie's wife.  All right.  Well, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  Oh, she's smiling.  They came out to a little Bruce Springsteen music.  Really?  When, uh...  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe she's still wearing her Halloween mask.  Oh, wow.  You know, I didn't realize Election Day and Halloween very close together.  She could have just forgotten.  Anyway, Tom Swazee.  Tom Swazee was running against Edward Mangano. 
[00:26:30]  He's the Republican who I voted for.  Now, the problem is, um, here's, here's the vote count so far with 100% of the precincts  reporting.  Uh, Tom Swazee, 118,111 votes for 48% of the vote.  Uh, Edward Mangano, 117,874 votes.  That's...  So it's the difference between...  About 300 votes?  ...111 and 874, pretty much. 
[00:27:00]  All right, you want me to do the math?  That would be, uh, 237, 38.  Wait, wait, wait.  8, 9, 10, yeah, yeah.  238?  Yeah.  230.  About that.  You're talking a couple hundred votes separating these two.  Now, Steve Hansen...  Who the fuck is Steve Hansen?  ...is the monkey wrench.  He, uh, is a...  He's considered the conservative candidate, and he got 4% of the vote, 9,552 votes.  The problem is, this Steve Hansen guy worked in Tom Swazee's office. 
[00:27:30]  He was one of the guys that worked with Tom Swazee, and then decided he's gonna run under  the conservative ticket, uh, at a...  What?  He works with Swazee as, what, a Democrat?  And then decides he's gonna be a conservative?  That was the way to siphon votes off of, uh, Edward Mangano.  So these politicians have figured out how to siphon votes off for themselves?  How to fucking take the votes off other people. 
[00:28:00]  Motherfuckers.  Dude, it is a scam that I've never even fucking thought was possible, but these guys are some  of the lowest live piece of shit, uh, ever.  So that's gonna be a recount.  They're gonna...  This one's gonna be a while.  That...  But, the Nassau legislature, uh, uh, is back in Republican hands, so Swazee doesn't have  full reign of, uh, the pen, uh, for, you know, whatever he wants to do.  Is he over his, uh, brother's death?  Uh, who? 
[00:28:30]  Swazee.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Was he?  What?  Patrick Swazee.  Oh, oh, oh my god.  Boo!  Holy shit!  So bad, it's funny.  His name was Swayze, Ope.  Ah, god damn.  Patrick Swazee is great.  Uh...  But that, by the way, Opie is the one who hit bull on that.  Yeah, of course.  Be more putty! 
[00:29:00]  Oh, god damn.  But it's, uh, yeah.  And then, uh, a lot of Republicans were, uh, getting, uh, a lot of, I guess the vote down  in Virginia for governor was another one that the Republicans took.  Uh, yeah.  Well, we got an update on that from Dan in Knoxville.  From old Virginia!  That's why we got this, uh, this great platform.  It's a national show.  What do you know on this one, Dan?  Hey, what's up, Ope?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, uh, the whole idea about the Virginia being tied in there, I know it doesn't directly  relate to you guys, but it was just to show a trend that, uh, all three seats went Republican. 
[00:29:30]  Swept it.  Yeah.  It, uh, it really was amazing.  And then there's, um, there's a district in upstate New York that another bit of shenanigans  happened on that is, is fucking just re-goddamn-diculous.  Yeah, five out of six, wasn't it?  Five out of six went Republican.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it was, uh, it actually, it's setting a tone where perhaps next year during the midterm  elections, uh, they're gonna really have a lot to worry about.  This'll calm the fucking Democrats down with their bullshit fucking legislation because 
[00:30:00]  they see, like, uh-oh, they're gonna kick my fucking ass out of here.  It seems like whenever there's so much one-way, people kind of want some kind of a battle.  Like, if it was all Republicans, a few Democrats would have won.  People just see it being too out of balance.  It doesn't, uh, yeah, it doesn't take long.  It took a year for people to be, like, fucking praying to the Messiah of Obama and to be  going, like, well, wait a minute, I need a few of these guys in there to keep these  guys in check.  And Obama was elected a year ago already?  Wow.  Yeah.  A year ago today.  What was the big movies made? 
[00:30:30]  Um, I know you're gonna say taxes.  I know you're gonna say taxes and all that, but I mean, what was his, what, what, what  was the big thing he got done in the last year?  25% done already with his presidency.  Yeah, give me one big thing.  He's concentrated and put so much energy in this healthcare bullshit.  But there is a whole thing about how he's gonna change the world.  I mean, he's gotta get going.  We're gonna change America.  He's gotta get going.  He's got a Secretary of State there, uh, old fat feet, uh, uh, out all over the globe,  and you never really hear what she's doing. 
[00:31:00]  Mm-hmm.  You never really hear what she's fucking doing as far as, uh, Secretary of Stating.  Who are you taking in the big, uh...  Oh, wait, wait, Obama has, all right, I'm sorry.  I'll give, I'll give him the one thing.  What?  He's letting people with AIDS into the country, people that were restricted from entering  the country.  He's letting people with AIDS, uh, into the United States of America.  Thank you, Obama.  Job well done.  Job well done.  Hey, uh, uh, Rich from South Carolina makes a very good point.  Hey, Rich.  Hey, Opie, it's a little, uh, early in the month to be funny. 
[00:31:30]  Pace yourself.  Fucking assholes.  Eh, I'm trying to find myself.  Who are you taking in the big fight?  There's a big fight going down soon.  The big fight?  Also known as the big, uh, debate.  Uh, it was announced, it was announced yesterday.  Bush and Clinton will be debating.  What?  What is it?  Wow, where?  Which college?  It's probably some college.  Uh, paying them millions of dollars for it.  Oh, I bet.  Right?  It's an all-out debate.  It's like a fucking Allie Frazier fight going down. 
[00:32:00]  Damn.  Where's it going down?  It's, I think it's going down like Madison Square Garden or something.  It's at, uh, Radio City.  Yeah, Radio City.  Clinton-Bush debate?  Yeah, in February.  At Radio City?  How cool is that?  It's amazing.  Dude, Clinton is gonna kick his ass.  I don't care.  I'm not telling a few jokes here.  I don't care.  He's funny.  I don't care politically what side you're on.  Fucking Clinton's gonna run circles around him.  You know what?  You might be right.  Clinton knows how to talk.  Bush is...  Debate and smile. 
[00:32:30]  Bush is, I think, a more savvy politician than people give him credit for.  He's a really...  You think he can handle himself in front of Clinton for real?  I think that Clinton is probably better at it, but I think Bush will be better than  you think.  Like, I don't think Bush will win, because, plus, there's so much anti-Bush sentiment.  Clinton went out.  I do think Clinton will absolutely win, because I think he's probably a better debater.  He's got that charisma, Jimmy.  Yeah.  But I think that, uh, Bush is gonna do better than people think he's gonna do.  How bad do you wanna go?  I wanna go to that.  And like I said, I'm not a big, uh, you know, politics guy. 
[00:33:00]  That would kind of be fun to, uh, to us to go at it.  How much are they getting?  I'd love to know.  They have to be getting, splitting the door somehow, plus a giant guarantee.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Everyone's...  It just hit yesterday.  Everyone's gonna be talking about this, uh, in the coming weeks.  Uh, oh, Obama tripled the deficit, so, that's what he's done so far.  Oh, he's tripled the deficit also.  Sorry, sorry.  Didn't see that.  You know what came out yesterday, Ant?  I think that, um, 75% of your Yankees are Obama supporters.  Does that affect...  No, that doesn't surprise me at all. 
[00:33:30]  Does that affect, um, you being a fan?  It's obviously based on race.  It's obviously based on race.  So, you're rooting for guys that love Obama, you know, you know, that's kind of...  That's okay.  That's okay with you?  Yeah.  All right.  I don't care if people like Obama.  It's, uh, you know, it's their problem.  I made that up.  Um, oh, thank you.  Uh, Chuck in Boston.  I feel better.  I was gonna start rooting for the Phillies.  What's up, Chuck?  Hey, good morning.  Uh, I've got your political update from Boston.  Boston.  Yes. 
[00:34:00]  Well, guess who's mayor today of Boston?  Yeah, mayor Menino won a fifth term.  He did it, man.  Fifth term.  Now, Anthony and I got kicked out of Boston.  Jesus.  11 years ago, believe it or not.  It seems like yesterday, but we haven't done radio, uh, in the city itself in 11 years.  And when we got there, mayor Menino was already the mayor.  He sucks.  It's been there forever.  It's amazing. 
[00:34:30]  Forever.  What's going on up there?  We got some mayor Menino talking about, uh, his win.  Oh, really?  Sure.  Please.  Hey, Chuck, thank you, buddy.  You're welcome, buddy.  Chuck in Boston.  Uh, Menino talks about what comes next for Boffiston.  Tonight, as we stand here.  Yeah, you guys keep believing it.  Tonight, as we stand here on a farm in Boffiston. 
[00:35:00]  You guys keep believing in your politicians.  That's okay.  Oh, God.  They're cartoon characters.  This motherfucker.  And get Bloomberg, uh, sounding a bit swishy.  I want to hear some of that.  Tonight, as we stand here, filled with energy for what comes next, we're reminded again that  That city, more than three centuries old, still changes every day. 
[00:35:30]  Today, somewhere in Boston, a teacher taught a child to read.  An entrepreneur.  Teacher taught a child.  Shout a child.  What?  What is he saying?  An entrepreneur.  Somewhere in Boston, a teacher taught a mayor how to read today.  That's nice.  Nothing.  Maybe we should have gave it a second and hoped for the best.  An entrepreneur started a novel business. 
[00:36:00]  A neighbor welcomed a new Bostonian.  A doctor pioneered a new therapy.  Before they started the day, or after they came home, they went to the polls.  Whoever they voted for, they voted to reinvent our city yet again.  Re-event?  Yet again?  What? 
[00:36:30]  By putting you back in there?  To reinvent our city yet again with me again.  Re-event.  Yes.  What the fuck?  Unbelievable.  Boston's a cool city, too, man.  I like a little Boston.  I guess there's nothing terrible going on in Boston, though.  As much as the guy's a blithering idiot, the city runs.  I mean...  It's just amazing, though, that no one can come up from the ranks and take him out.  Yeah.  Nah.  Yet again, the headlines may read that today we're elected... 
[00:37:00]  Elected to a fifth.  What the fuck are you saying?  How are you not good at this yet?  Yes.  Yeah, it's not like you just got into office.  He didn't just get the gig.  He's been there for fucking ever.  Fucking Big A does the news better.  16 years he's been in that office.  How does he not know how to talk publicly after all this practice?  Wow.  I had to back that up a bit.  Yeah, I want to hear that.  Listen again. 
[00:37:30]  The headlines may read that today we're elected to a fifth historic term.  Holy shit.  You've not been elected to a fifth historic term.  It's not like you had one historic term after another.  Yeah, yeah.  Another.  It's a historic fifth term.  True.  You fucking wrong order putting words in fucking whole ass. 
[00:38:00]  Whole ass.  You have to be a good public speaker if you're going to be a politician.  Oh, my God.  I think you just have to.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  It continues.  Thank God.  We got a couple more clips from Menino.  Let's be clear.  We haven't made history with this election, but we will.  What we create of it.  What does that even mean? 
[00:38:30]  Like, spoken properly, what would that even mean?  Like a good glass of wine.  I like to take my time with this audio and savor it.  Just kind of enjoy it.  Yeah.  Swish it around in our mouths a little bit like he does with his fucking tongue.  Create of it.  Oh, wait.  I want to hear that of it again.  Of it.  Hold on.  Sorry.  But we will.  What we create of it. 
[00:39:00]  When we have provided a new Boston miracle for our kids.  I don't even know what that.  Design a new urban.  I don't even know what that.  What did he say there?  We provided a new Boston miracle for our kid.  You got provided out of it?  I think so.  Very good.  Very good for you.  Miracle for our kids.  Design a new urban mechanics for our city.  Build one sheer future out of our diverse backgrounds. 
[00:39:30]  Let them write the record books then.  The record books?  We put our resins in jobs.  Resins.  Shops and vacant spaces.  Resins.  Students through college.  And the city has a physical downturn.  Physical.  Have people talking in the background.  Let's talk about history.  Holy babbling idiot.  It's amazing.  What a buffoon.  We have one more clip if you'd like to hear it. 
[00:40:00]  Please.  Yeah.  I wish we had more.  Let me say hi to Jack in South Carolina.  Jack.  Hey boys.  Happy birthday everyone.  Hello, sweet.  Especially you.  What's your name?  Hey, listen.  I don't know if it's the sound quality or anything like that, but he sounds just like Archie Bunker sitting in a chair after about a six pack of beer.  Hey.  Now he's like, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then all you need is an Edith Bunker.  Give me a beer, Edith. 
[00:40:30]  And shut up, Meathead.  What a blithering idiot.  That's all I have to offer.  Thank you, sir.  It wasn't much.  Oh, good observation.  Wes, the trucker.  Wes?  Hey, boys.  Super quick.  I like how George Bush would say one word wrong and just get crucified.  And then, yeah.  And then this guy can't even talk for the past however many years and no one says shit about it. 
[00:41:00]  That's true.  I mean, I understand Bush was the president, so that's another level up from a mayor, obviously.  But just no one says nothing about this guy.  Yeah, the media up there in Boston, they pretty much leave him alone.  I mean, there's a few guys, I guess they take a little shot here and there, but it's amazing.  They just let him just babble like this and don't bring it up as a very obvious thing.  He can't speak.  Go ahead.  No, so the media treats that kind of the way they should.  Like, it really doesn't matter.  A little mis...  He's just not a great speaker. 
[00:41:30]  Like, it almost is like, as much as he's an idiot, the fact that he's not a good speaker  and keeps getting elected is...  You gotta kind of like that.  I guess.  They attacked Bush for making mistakes, and yet when John Kerry, who was running against  him, would make...  There were certain words he couldn't say.  They called it a verbal misstep.  Misstep.  It was amazing how, like, the times and stuff would softly word it for him, and yet Bush  was a blithering idiot.  Right, right.  Let's say hi to Randy.  Randy.  Yeah?  What's up, Randy?  How you doing, guys?  All right, Randy.  Hey, you know, those are the people who are cheering.  I'm really people who elected him. 
[00:42:00]  Those are all his special education teachers.  That's it for me.  It certainly is.  All right, one more clip from Mayor Menino.  The stories may say that today we beat our toughest opponent, but we haven't passed the  biggest obstacle yet. 
[00:42:30]  My tongue.  Complacency is the highest hurdle we face.  Let us fend off the temptation to rest on past accomplishments, or to walk in familiar  paths.  When we do, them, them, them, rape.  Only then.  What did he say right there?  Yeah, them, them, rape.  Them, them, rape.  Rape.  It's not like he said them, them, rape.  Them, them, rape.  That's a hell of a platform to run on.  Yeah, what the fuck? 
[00:43:00]  I think he wants everyone to rape.  I'm not really sure.  I'd have heard about this one.  Then, then, rape?  Shouldn't that be on the front page?  Yeah.  Mayor Menino encourages everyone to rape any rape, rape, rape.  Then, then, rape.  To walk in familiar paths.  When we do, them, them, them, rape.  Only then.  Let them rape?  Then we can't overcame.  Can't overcame.  Our strongest child.  Then we can't overcame.  Did he just say can't overcame?  He is a disaster.  Yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Then we can't overcame our strongest challenges.  Our victory today is not a trophy to put on a shelf or to parade on a duck boat.  It's not a championship, but a chance.  It's an opportunity to improve our neighbors' lives.  To bring the city together. 
[00:44:00]  And to move it forward.  Oh, he stinks.  We are going to need all our strengths.  All 600,000 of us.  He literally says nothing that is sincere.  It is all political hack.  We must concentrate on doing good, not bad.  Shut up!  Not quite.  We must go to the moon by the end of the decad.  Holy moly. 
[00:44:30]  I could listen to that all day.  I could just listen to him.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Every little word is just magical.  He's the mayor of Boston.  He's newly elected.  Another four years for that guy.  Wow.  Let's go to Rick in Maine.  Rick.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  What's up, Rick?  Nice to see you.  Nice to see you, Opie.  You know, I kind of feel like as a working man, you know, I work with a crew of like 30  or 40 people and not one of us voted last night and now no matter where we go, we have these 
[00:45:00]  idiots that spend their life just trying to screw us over and we should start paying  attention more and voting.  You can't work anymore and have any say in nothing.  It really kind of is a good thing to just get out there and fucking vote.  It takes no time at all.  And like, I don't know.  I know a lot of these guys are all the same and shit like that.  But if you shake them up a little bit.  Punch your own guy.  Thanks.  Thanks, man.  If you shake them up a little bit, like the Democrats got a little shaken up last night 
[00:45:30]  and the Republicans have been shaken up in the past.  Believe me, they got shaken up with the last fucking presidential election.  It just keeps them from really going a little too far one way or the other.  But so don't you think parties have gone way too far?  Yeah.  You know, I know you're you're you're a Republican and it's the lesser of two evils in your mind.  But yeah, I want to start going to protests.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I'm getting fire hosed. 
[00:46:00]  Well, I openly admit I don't guess.  I openly admit I don't vote and people like yell and scream at me, you know, blah, blah, blah.  But I think where I could I need to start going to some of these protests.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because then then I could, you know, then I could.  That's better than voting.  Who was I supposed to vote for?  I don't know.  You just vote along.  You know, you get online, you do a little research on these guys to find out what their platforms are and then you vote accordingly.  I want to just, you know, figure it out.  I want to throw my face, you know, out of protest. 
[00:46:30]  Out of protest?  Yeah, one more face.  Just Greg Opie Hughes.  One more face in the crowd.  No, just be there.  I don't need to be the fucking vocal asshole.  Protesting.  Just be one of the masses.  Yeah.  Where are these protests?  I need to join one.  Apparently, you don't fit the criteria for a real popular protest.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You're a little pale for some of the protests.  I've seen the Tea Party protests.  Tea Party.  Now, those you could fit.  They're pretty white.  Yeah.  Those are really white.  Those are good.  Those are good Tea Party protests. 
[00:47:00]  I could go menstrual.  But that's pretty much conservative party.  Was it menstrual?  That doesn't really.  Oh, you want to put a menstrual makeup on?  Yeah, I'll do some menstrual makeup.  It's different than menstrual makeup.  I like having menstrual makeup on.  I know you do.  You talk about that.  I don't quit.  I don't care what time it is.  You put that menstrual pain on.  Menstrual makeup.  Oh, my God.  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my...  Menstrual and menstrual.  That's very...  Wow.  Too close for comfort there.  Now, this other thing that happened was a big fight in New York's 23rd congressional district. 
[00:47:30]  Where the fuck is that?  Now, you're saying, where the fuck is that?  I have to say that.  It's a quarter of New York State.  Really?  Upstate, though.  It's upstate.  It's right by Canada.  Well, part.  I've been part of upstate.  Northwest quarter of the state of New York.  That's fucking Rochester and Buffalo.  Is that what's in there?  That's my area.  I lived up there for 10 years.  It's like a lot of farms and fucking open prairie land and bullshit up there.  Yeah, but if it involves Rochester and Buffalo, that's pretty big. 
[00:48:00]  That's a big area.  It is.  And it might as well be Canada, people are saying.  It really is.  But it was very important as far as seeing which way the political winds are blowing, Republican or Democrat.  And here's the clusterfuck that happened up here.  And here's another thing that people just ought to be aware of.  There was a Republican and a Democrat going to be duking it out.  But this Democrat is the one that won eventually.  His name is Bill Owens.  He was up against this woman named Didi Skazafava. 
[00:48:30]  Skazafava.  Skazafava.  Got to change your name.  Yeah, I know.  It's an awful name.  If you're going to be in the spotlight, you got to change your name.  Make it easy for everybody.  Now, she's running as a Republican, right?  Right.  Meanwhile, she backed all of Obama's stimulus programs, the fucking, you know, and if you're talking Republican, she backed the abortion thing and stuff.  She was not a Republican.  She considered herself a moderate Republican, but she was completely a liberal Republican technically. 
[00:49:00]  So the Republicans said, fuck this.  We don't want her in there.  So they get this guy, Hoffman, who's one of these conservatives, and he runs up against this Democrat, Bill Owens.  Now, it's very close.  So this Skazafava drops out of the race at the last fucking minute.  She still got 5% of the fucking vote, which would have put over the conservative.  Instead, the Democrat wins because of the shenanigans. 
[00:49:30]  She backed out of the race and backed the Democrat.  What kind of Republican is she?  I don't blame her.  They saw her fucking a mile away, though, the Republicans saw her and said, get her the fuck out of there.  How long was she there for?  Not long.  Meaning, had she run and, like, had she done a term or two terms or?  No, no.  As a matter of fact, she hadn't.  I believe the, um, no, I don't think she had.  I'm not sure of that.  Who was the incumbent?  Was she the incumbent?  I'm not sure if she was, uh, the, I can't see her being the incumbent and then backing out because the Republican. 
[00:50:00]  The thing is, the Republicans don't have a primary for that, which would have settled that whole score and put, um, a good candidate in place.  But it's just one of the shenanigans.  I'll check and see who the fucking incumbent was there.  But it's just shenanigans.  She had 5.5% of the vote, would have put over the conservative.  And if she was a Republican, uh, she wouldn't have done that.  You know, she, she, she would have, um, either backed the conservative or, she, she embraces fucking, uh, uh, Obama. 
[00:50:30]  If the party loves her.  If you feel like the party rejects you, though, either side, you gotta go with the other one.  Like, if she felt like the Republicans all said, get the fuck out, she's gotta go fuck you.  But she wasn't a Republican.  She was a fucking liberal, uh, whatever.  Kind of like Bloomberg.  Bloomberg's the same thing.  He didn't want to be a Republican.  He's not a Republican.  He ran under the Republican ticket because he wanted to get in.  And now he's an independent.  He's classified as an independent. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, he's not even a Republican anymore.  Now he runs as an independent.  But this one was another one of shenanigans where someone else is in there, takes just enough of the vote away, uh, to fuck, uh, with everybody.  Not that it's an important, you know.  Well, voters gotta be aware of that shit.  They're not, though.  They're taking advantage of this third-party stuff.  Who voted for the person that wasn't in the fucking race?  It's 5.5% vote.  There's somebody sitting there pulling the lever for somebody that wasn't even running.  But I think voters have to start being aware that they're using this third-party candidate thing to help their own cause. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  Yes.  They gotta fucking realize that that is going on out there now.  That's what I say.  It's pretty obvious.  And by the way, that district is in Rochester and Buffalo, just so we have a note.  It is?  It isn't.  Oh, it isn't?  It's more Watertown?  Where's Watertown?  Is that like north of...  The town is water.  I think it's north of Syracuse, if I'm not mistaken.  It's the middle of nowhere.  It really makes no difference as far as the people there or anything.  But it was one of those things like it would have been a real, complete Republican sweep as far as, you know, the governor races and things like that.  They were looking at that one, too, as something that was going to be a big indicator of what's going to happen. 
[00:52:00]  And it's still, if you ask me, is an indicator that people are a little, you know, looking at the Democrats going, eh, slow down, motherfuckers.  Well, someone said that, uh, oh, okay, Les Allen.  How did Dems get shaken up?  They picked up two seats in Congress, Anthony.  What?  What?  That's what that's...  What are you talking about?  That's what Les Allen is saying.  How did Dems get shaken up?  By the governor.  The governor races were huge.  They picked up two seats in Congress. 
[00:52:30]  The governor races were huge.  The Jersey one's a big one.  The Jersey one's huge.  The Virginia one was huge.  That's how they got shaken up.  Obama went there fucking, how many times?  Three times to try to bail out fucking Corazine.  And Clinton, right?  Yeah, Clinton went there, too.  Corazine seemed kind of smug.  I'm glad that he lost.  So am I.  All right.  He was smug.  Which seats did they pick up?  Where?  What?  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's too much.  Please, Spock, explain. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Well, everyone's pretty much saying the same stuff, so.  There you go.  We're going to take our first break.  We're going to take our first break.  We're going to take our election rundown.  Very interesting.  I need more Mayor Menino audio if we can find it.  We'll take a break, get into some other things.  Ah, see, Corazine will now become an Obama czar.  That's from Neptune.  That's it.  Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if they throw him in something.  Yeah.  Travis, I'll take it from here.  We're going to play the Cartman poker face going into break. 
[00:53:30]  And we'll continue.  Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  What else is going on in the world?  Where did Ant go?  Ant got a phone call.  He's just getting reception.  Uh-oh.  Um, this fucking police officer, and we love the police officers.  Well, yeah, but now when they're fucking downloading Kitty Porn. 
[00:54:00]  Oh, you saw this story?  I walk into.  I'm on a Kitty Porn, bud.  Kitty Porn?  You're police officers and Kitty Porn, your two favorite things.  Oh, Jesus.  What happened?  And we got a serial killer in Cleveland.  Anybody from Cleveland?  We got a big audience in Cleveland.  Give us the details on that, please.  Did they arrest that guy or did they just get his house?  Wow, this guy is fucking crazy.  Please don't be one of our listeners.  Please don't be one of our listeners.  Please don't be one of our listeners. 
[00:54:30]  He's not one of our listeners.  He don't fit the fucking criteria for a serial killer either.  Uh-oh.  Black guy.  Black guy?  Come on, give it up for the black man.  Stepping into the fucking...  That's why you can't stereotype anymore.  Crazy serial killer fucking rapist.  Black guy.  The house guy, yes.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yes.  That rarely happens.  I was ready to say never, but we all remember the bad boy in Georgia.  Obama is bringing change.  We're getting black serial killers.  A black serial killer in Cleveland? 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  Now, are the victims multiracial or are they just black?  Because serial killers normally don't cross racial lines, but guys that kill hookers probably,  I think, do more or less.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Well, you got the sniper guy from years ago.  John Muhammad?  Yeah.  That was obviously serial killing.  Yes.  On kind of a weird little different twist.  He didn't have any preference.  Yeah, yeah.  Random.  This guy rapes bodies in his house.  That's more like my typo.  Wow, this guy's crazy. 
[00:55:30]  Is he in jail, this guy?  I think I saw his mug shot.  I'm going to do some reading and then we'll find out.  Do some reading.  More remains were discovered Tuesday at the Cleveland home of a convicted rapist, raising  to 10 the number of bodies that have been found there.  How the fuck could you live among dead bodies?  I know the guy's nuts, obviously.  You need a lot of lye and lime, and then you hang up a bunch of those deodorant things  that you usually get for the car.  For the things in the dryer?  Yeah.  Yeah, the dryer sheets. 
[00:56:00]  Looks like the bedroom from Seven.  Yeah.  Hey, what are these all hanging up for?  Oh.  You think the serial killer's enjoying a good episode of Family Guy knowing that there's  10 dead bodies in his house?  Dead bodies just rotting.  You ever think that weird shit?  That's scary.  Like he's enjoying some fine comedy knowing there's like dead bodies under the floorboards?  Do you live a normal life in between killing people?  Or are you just obsessed about killing people all the time? 
[00:56:30]  Or do you take a break from that?  I think you're so crazy.  Like you can't think like this guy.  You can't go, wow, is he just sitting there?  His mind has just got shit in it that you can't even comprehend.  Like fucking bubbles and stars and shit.  Yeah.  And fucking cartoon birds going, like he's just fucking crazy.  Well, all right.  So they got 10, okay, 10 dead bodies they found in his home so far.  Four more bodies in a skull were found at the home where the remains of six women were removed 
[00:57:00]  last week.  He lives in the home, is in jail, was charged Tuesday with five counts of aggravated murder.  What's aggravated murder, Anthony?  Why can't it just be murder for everything?  That means you aggravated the person before you killed them.  You went, hey, I'm watching that.  Hey, give me the remote.  Oh, you piss him off a little bit?  Yeah, you piss him off.  No.  Aggravated means something else is going on, right?  Isn't that it?  Hey, Kenny.  It's your fucking expertise right here.  You walk away.  Yeah, fuck getting us coffee.  What's the difference between a crime and aggravated? 
[00:57:30]  That's what I say.  What's the difference?  And he just leaves.  What a fucking...  You gotta love Kenny.  We're gonna get back to the serial killer, but this is a perfect time to play this.  There's a song out there right now that's very popular, Anthony.  Is there?  By a little-known artist known as Jay-Z.  He's very popular.  Jay-Z redid the New York State of Mind song by Billy Joel. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, he calls it Empire State of Mind, but we all know it's New York State of Mind.  Yeah.  For the hip-hoppers.  Yeah, of course.  You know, a player by the name of Derek Jeter comes out to this music.  To this one?  Yes.  When he bats?  Yeah.  It's his new, like, coming out on the field music.  I didn't know that.  Oh, yeah.  Gay.  Hey, look, I don't like it at all, so...  You don't like...  Oh, stop.  You don't like hip-hop at all? 
[00:58:30]  Oh, I like when fucking Rivera comes out.  Enter Sandman, motherfucker.  Predictable.  Oh.  I can't keep up with some of this new music.  I don't understand when Derek Jeter comes out.  I gotta keep track of hip-hop songs.  How am I supposed to keep track of all the hip-hop songs now?  I barely know what Metallica was.  Well, our own Club Soda Kenny took a shot at Jay-Z's Empire State of Mind.  Oh, he did?  So we got a little taste here. 
[00:59:00]  And then we'll go back to the Black Serial Killer story.  All right-o.  And then the child porn story right after that.  Wow.  A lot of humor for everybody today.  Oh, yeah.  Fun-filled.  Turn the beat up.  Uh-huh.  Troy Kwan into his.  My main man, primetime.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm out there, Brooklyn.  Now I'm down in Tribeca.  Right next to De Niro.  I'll be hooked forever.  I'm the new Sinatra.  And since I made it here, I can make it anywhere. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, they love me everywhere.  I used to cop in Harlem.  All my Domenico's.  Hey, yo, right there on Broadway.  Brought me back to that McDonald's.  Took it to my stair spot.  560 State Street.  Catch me in the kitchen.  Like Simmons whipping pastry.  Cruising down A Street.  All-white Lexus.  Driving so slow.  But BK.  It's from Texas.  Now I'm at that Bed-Stuy.  Home of the boy Biggie.  Say what's up to Tata.  Sipping my ties.  Still courtside.  Nicks and nicks. 
[01:00:00]  Give me high fives.  Two that are most definitely from New York.  Concrete jungle where dreams are made of.  There's nothing you can't do.  No, no, no, no.  You're in New York.  These lights will make you feel brand new.  These lights will inspire you.  Let's hear it for New York.  New York.  New York.  Catch you hot, nigga. 
[01:00:30]  Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game.  Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can.  You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't no crypto.  But I got a gang of niggas walking with my click, though.  Welcome to the melting pot.  Corners where we sell rocks.  African babadish shit.  Home of the hip hop.  Yellow camp, gypsy camp, dollar back.  Hollaback for foreigners.  And they'd fit and act like they forgot how to act.  Eight million stories out there and they're naked. 
[01:01:00]  City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it.  Me, I got a plug that's special and I got it made.  It's cheesy playing LeBron.  I'm playing Dwayne Wade.  Three dice, Carlo.  Three card, Marley.  Labor Day.  In New York.  In New York.  The park.  Concrete jungle where dreams are made of.  There's nothing you can't do.  Now you're in New York.  These streets will make you feel brand new.  The lights will inspire you. 
[01:01:30]  Let's hear it for New York.  New York.  New York.  Yes!  I like that.  Big ups to all my peeps.  And a big shout out to my personal producer, Troy Kwan.  And my inspirational producer, Primetime Sam Roberts.  What?  Holy shit.  That's horrendous, but that doesn't make me want to hear the real song.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  Empire State of Mindless.  I think we found the new Biz Markie.  He's working among us.  New York!  Fucking Kenny.  Good job on that.  Well, that was inspiring.  I think that'll put the Yankees right over the top.  Yeah.  A song like that.  I got goosebumps.  So did I.  They're called douche chills, though.  All right.  Serial killer.  So we got 10 bodies they found.  Black serial killer in Ohio.  Yeah. 
[01:02:30]  They found the additional bodies in the backyard, Anthony.  Yeah.  They only thought they had a couple at first.  And boy, did they just start popping up all over his property.  And they also found a skull in a bucket in the basement.  Yeah.  Just decided to put a skull in the basement.  I bet it wasn't a skull when it started out in that bucket.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Probably just a head in a bucket.  It's like, where am I going to put this?  Motherfucker, I got to put this in a basement and shit.  And then he put it in the basement.  And then it just, you know, turned into the old skull. 
[01:03:00]  I want to see a picture of this guy.  Do we have one?  Oh, yeah.  I think Danny popped his face up before.  I didn't see it, Dan.  Oh, yeah.  We.  Wow.  Okay.  Oh, they don't know if the skull belongs to an 11th victim.  He looks nuts.  Yeah.  He looks like Marvin Hagler.  What a fucking nut.  He's got a big round light bulb head.  He looks like a fucking murderer.  Yeah.  Does he look like he would be a problem?  Yeah.  He's a crazy fuck.  He almost also has.  He looks like one, at least.  If you take the goatee off of him, he almost has a Mariano Rivera look to him also. 
[01:03:30]  He's a little, just a little bit.  Something in the eyes.  Hey, do we have our old serial killer song we used to play?  Oh, my God.  That's an oldie but goodie.  Maybe E-Rock could find it.  I don't even know if it holds up.  But we used to play it every time a serial killer story would hit the news.  Oh, yeah.  It's not one of our originals.  We actually try to give credit where credit's due.  But we don't even know who did it.  I really don't know who did it.  So the skull might be an 11th victim, Anthony. 
[01:04:00]  Now, here's your stats in the sky.  Might be.  I don't think they volunteered for that.  How does it just end up in the fucking...  No, they found 10 bodies.  So they're not sure if this skull is part of the 10 bodies or another victim, which would make 11.  Well, if you find 10 skulls with the bodies, then you just find an 11th skull, you can assume.  Because no one volunteered.  No one showed up and said, that bucket's empty.  Why don't you put my head in it?  Fill that bucket up properly.  Well, here we go.  So they found one body in a shallow grave in the backyard last week. 
[01:04:30]  The rest were inside the house.  This is what I was just saying.  This is fucking...  This makes it even creepier.  Here, one in the basement, two in the third floor living room.  Just two bodies in the living room.  And then two in an upstairs crawl space.  Yeah, you gotta put them in the crawl space.  What the fuck?  Rape kid in crawl space.  You don't need a crawl space.  Sorry.  What a great place for a body, though.  It really is.  The crawl space.  For a pipe access and things like that. 
[01:05:00]  It's a great place until the fluids start tripping on your head.  I had to do a lot of work in crawl spaces, my friend.  And it is not pleasant.  I had to run duct work and everything and crawl spaces.  And a lot of times, there's no cement in there.  You're on a dirt fucking floor.  And there's rats and dead animals and bugs everywhere.  Fuck yeah.  And then you're trying to work in a spot that's about two feet tall.  And you gotta, like, drill holes in the wood above you.  And the shit's falling in your face. 
[01:05:30]  The worst!  What kind of bugs?  Big beetles and centipedes.  Those big fucking centipedes and the roly-poly water bugs.  Did you ever have one on you?  Oh, those were easy.  Yeah, they'd get on me all the time.  It was horrid.  It was like a torture.  What about the silverfish?  No, there wasn't silverfish in the dirt.  Those things are creepy.  Yeah, they suck.  I know they can't really do much to you, but they're just fucking creepers.  They're not fighters up the fucking ass spiders.  Really?  Whids all over the place.  Look at that silverfish.  Google silverfish if you've never seen one before.  Is that a silverfish? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, it looks like one.  That looks like it.  God, you can't tell if it's coming and going.  They fucking run very quickly, too.  Look at that little fucking thing.  It sure knows how to fight off its predators, but it's not on its ass.  It has so many wispy legs.  Yeah.  Getting back to yesterday's discussion, do you want the moth to look like a silverfish?  Because that looks about what you were talking about yesterday.  Yeah, that looks like a little hairy pussy.  A silverfish.  Ew, just lick it down its back.  He's a registered sex offender, this piece of shit.  Well, before we get to that point, how he caught a fucking woman, went to the police 
[01:06:30]  and said she was raped at his home.  So she's lucky in a way.  How'd she get out of there?  I don't know.  She got out of there alone.  She just messed up, man.  They're just like, yeah, I'll just fucking, then you can go.  You can leave.  Maybe she got out.  Got a head?  Because that explains the skull in the bucket.  All six were black.  All the bodies.  So it's like serial killer form.  Stay within the race.  Stay within your race.  That's it.  Sometimes serial killers have the right.  Oh, what?  And they don't know if the bodies were there for weeks, months, or years. 
[01:07:00]  We got the rest of the story, Jimmy?  You did the sex offender stuff there, right?  I just read at the bottom.  He's a registered sex offender.  He's required to check in regularly, but they did not have the right to enter his house.  But they'd stop by to make sure he was there.  How did they not have the right to enter his house?  Well, because, again, why is a sex offender right?  Why is a fucking convicted rapist out?  It's fucking sickening.  These sexual predators should be fucking, they should have their dicks and balls cut off.  They don't.  It's so irritating.  We mentioned this before.  If you have a guy that, let's say, in a rage of the moment, kills his wife or something 
[01:07:30]  because he walks in, sees her in bed with somebody or whatever, he goes to prison for a long fucking time.  You know what?  He's got, like, that weird part of him that is capable of doing that, but he probably wouldn't do it again,  barring the same circumstance.  You know what I mean?  It's like, oh, my God, I can't believe I did that, whatever.  A rapist isn't somebody that can be let out and stop raping. 
[01:08:00]  A child molester can't stop doing that.  It's not a situation that presented itself that made them do it.  It's something in their body.  It's a sickness just like fucking cancer would be or anything else.  You can't just let them fucking out.  I agree with you.  They stay evil.  I agree with you.  A murderer, maybe in certain circumstances, some people like serial killers, that's the same thing.  There's a difference between a serial killer and a guy that commits a crime of murder, like manslaughter or something like that. 
[01:08:30]  There's a difference.  You know, a friend of mine had kids, and he said when he had kids, he understood that he could murder somebody.  That he could kill?  That he could actually kill.  A lot of kids are really pains in the asses.  Well, he never thought about whether he could kill someone or not until he had kids and realized, holy shit, I'm capable of killing.  To defend his kids.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's not a psycho.  Like Andrea Gates.  I'm capable of killing my kids.  No, no, no, this guy is a normal dude. 
[01:09:00]  He goes, that's when I realized, holy shit, I am capable of killing.  Yeah.  By the way.  To defend my kids.  Absolutely.  To finish up the story, because I missed a really good line.  Huh?  Read the last two lines.  Yeah, I want to get to that.  Okay, you did that.  So, for the past few years, Sowell's?  I think Sowell.  Sowell?  Yeah, I'll guess.  Sowell's?  Simon Cowell's Simon Sowell.  Sowell's neighbors thought the smell enveloping their street corner had been coming from a brick building where workers churned out sausage and head cheese. 
[01:09:30]  Wow, what a perfect cover.  Yeah.  You smell dead human, you're going to think it's head cheese.  The fucking neighbors thought it was this stupid factory or whatever that was churning out sausage and head cheese.  It got so bad that the owners of Ray's Sausage replaced their sewer line and grease traps.  Holy shit.  They actually replaced shit thinking that their factory stunk.  Imagine that.  And it turned out to be...  They were so close to catching this guy. 
[01:10:00]  Dead people.  Another one of these things where they were right there.  Too many of them lived next door to a Yankee Candle.  They would have had them immediately.  That doesn't smell delicious like cinnamon.  That's not vanilla.  That's orange.  That's a rotting hooker.  How bad a rotting hooker must smell?  Holy Toledo.  Is this Tim?  It is.  Okay, what's up, Tim?  Tim in Cleveland.  Yeah, you know, I was looking at the Plain Dealer this morning.  They've got a headline on one of the articles about this story about the neighbors finally getting an idea of what that mysterious smell is. 
[01:10:30]  You know, if they've been living around this for years without having any idea what the smell was.  Dude, now, wasn't Jeffrey Dahmer from a suburb of Cleveland?  No.  Milwaukee.  Milwaukee.  Oh, was it Milwaukee?  No, but wasn't he originally born in a suburb of Cleveland?  I think he is originally from a suburb of Ohio, somewhere near Cleveland.  Why?  What are you getting at? 
[01:11:00]  I just think that Ohio is a horrible state that raises serial killers.  What?  Yeah.  He wasn't born there, but he did move there.  Oh, he moved there?  Yeah, when he was eight, his family moved to Bath, Ohio.  Yes, because I'd been through there, dude.  I saw his house.  Really?  Yes.  I saw the house where he was growing up and probably killed small animals.  Nice.  Yes.  You ever kill small animals?  I killed a newt once, a salamander. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, that's...  No.  And felt horrible about it.  It was...  I was a kid, probably about seven years old.  And yeah, there used to be little salamanders by Hexer Park down in Long Island.  And not Newt from Ali.  Danny puts up a quick picture of poor Newt.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah, that's a good call right there.  But the way I killed it was horrible.  I was like...  At that age, you're not sure about life and death and things like that, but it was crawling  on the picnic table out back. 
[01:12:00]  And I had a tin can lid from like a tuna fish can.  And I wheeled it like a pizza cutter right across the thing's back and cut it completely  in two.  And it went...  When I cut it in half.  It made a noise?  Yes!  You're a serial killer.  Dude, it horrified me.  No, no.  Where you got your bodies buried?  I have no buried bodies because it horrified me.  And I felt so awful and guilty and terrible at what I did. 
[01:12:30]  And, you know, never did it again.  You know, hunting, you know, rabbits.  You pop them, you eat them and shit like that.  But never could kill a deer by hunting deer or anything.  But that was just a hands-on kind of sick way of killing an animal.  And it taught me like right then.  I think at that point, that was a crossroad for me right there.  That's one of those human being crossroads where you go, all right, look, I didn't know  it was going to be like that. 
[01:13:00]  It's horrible and terrible.  I'll never do that again.  Or, wow, that was really cool watching that animal suffer.  And I think I'm going to continue doing that.  I went the other way.  You make a great point because if you chopped its head off and then you got a boner, you  would have been a serial killer.  If I had a boner and put the little salamander head on my dick and walked around with it.  And made this noise.  He-le-le-le-le-le-le.  Yeah, that was a crossroad right there.  You could have collected your first trophy.  Yes, that would have been my first trophy. 
[01:13:30]  That's the difference though.  You either feel bad or you get some kind of fucking good feeling or boner or sexual urge  and you're like, fuck, I'm done.  I can't even tell you that I felt bad.  I felt horrid.  Like in a way that stayed with me.  And I still remember it.  And I'm talking seven years old.  And I still remember the sound it made and the feeling I got like, oh my God, what did  I just do?  It was horrible.  I never killed an animal on purpose.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  The first hooker I fucking did like that.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute.  I never killed an animal on purpose.  Yeah.  Now what about little Chester?  You're getting slow, man.  He seems to have, he was hungry.  He wanted a little bit of your steak.  You're a step behind.  What's up with you?  I didn't catch the on purpose thing.  I had to say the line twice. 
[01:14:30]  You actually sounded too sincere.  I just wanted a Judy impression today.  That's for the old schoolers.  You know, my first act of bravery was saving an animal from a bully.  No.  Yes.  The bully, also the boy who would sometimes put his weenie in my mouth, who wore Budweiser  fucking baby suit trunks.  Oh, the Budweiser shirt guy?  And they smelled like mothballs.  I just heard that.  His trunks smelled like mothballs.  I just heard that replay recently with laughing my ass off.  But he put a cat in a box with fucking nails and tacks in it.  What a fuck this kid is. 
[01:15:00]  What a psycho.  Where did he end up?  I don't know.  Don't know.  But I let the cat out of the box and I ran away.  Let the cat out of the box.  Too bad it wasn't a bag or a hat.  I think everyone had someone in their neighborhood that did some shit with cats.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They were crazy people.  I remember, what the fuck was that pond near us in Centerport?  I remember there was a big story where some asshole fucking threw a bunch of kittens in  a...  In that pond?  In a burlap.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I heard that story, too.  It was a burlap sack filled with kittens. 
[01:15:30]  Just threw them in there.  Got his job.  Yeah.  Remember when there were frogs, like toads, everywhere on Long Island?  Mm-hmm.  Like, Long Island used to be like a fucking Jurassic Park.  There were all kinds of fucking amphibians and reptiles and tortoises and shit walking around  before they built everything up.  Frogs are disappearing.  Look it up.  There's a lot of theories why they're disappearing.  One, that they're aliens.  Ah, really?  And they're going home.  I'm not buying...  I don't see any little frog spaceships.  Yeah, little teeny spaceships that fucking can hop around not hitting their heads. 
[01:16:00]  They don't bang their heads in the metal roof.  There was a kid in Central Islip that used to take the toads and throw them up in the air  as high as he could and let it just come down and hit the street.  How the fuck?  I was like, I don't know how you could do that.  How are you doing that?  I remember the kids would do that when they were kids.  It's just because of the splat.  And then he'd laugh.  But I don't know how you could do that.  And then he'd laugh, like, ah, hey, hey, hey.  Like, oh, God.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  It's terrible. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  People are just pieces of shit.  If you watch that stupid Sarah McLachlan animal commercial and you're going, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That one's rough.  Then maybe, you know, you ought to be investigated.  I'm not a major animal rights activist by any means, but that commercial's rough.  When Patrice said that poor kitten with conjunctivitis in both eyes, I just lost my fucking shit.  That shit is rough.  Poor little kitten's crusty face and the dog with his nose peeled off and shit.  They look all sad.  It's terrible.  There was a guy abusing a dog in the neighborhood the other day, and it fucking put me in a rage. 
[01:17:00]  But what am I supposed to do?  What was he doing?  He was hitting it pretty good and dragging it because it didn't want to walk.  And I'm like, I mean, can you strangle these people?  Oh, was he, like, pulling his dog on the pads?  Yeah.  Like, they don't have wheels, dude.  That's going to wear away on the sidewalk.  Because he's fucking New Yorkers.  They have dogs, but they don't have the patience to have a dog because they're too busy fucking trying to make something of themselves.  Yeah.  So then they take him for a walk, and if the dog doesn't feel like walking, a lot of dogs all of a sudden want to just stop. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  They're stupid dogs.  They don't know.  You as a good pet owner, you sit there and wait it out.  These fuckers will drag the dog on the sidewalk with, like you just said, their pads just dragging along.  Yeah.  And the rage, I feel, but I'm like, what happens to you if you strangle one of these guys?  For real.  I know.  And you got witnesses, by the way.  What kind of dog was it?  It was like a medium-sized fucking one of these new exotic-looking dogs.  I don't know the names. 
[01:18:00]  Like a...  A Bichon Frise?  No, I just put poo at the end of it.  A chica poo, a poodly poo, a fucking...  A chica poo?  A doodly doo poo hoo hoo.  You know, one of those poo dogs, I think.  But the rage, I feel, and I have nothing to do with this person or that dog.  Just dragging it.  I don't know.  Just dragging it.  If you have a dog, you need a lot of fucking time.  Responsibility.  People are always telling me I should get a dog.  They come to my house, they're like, you need a dog.  You should get a dog.  I say, why do I want a fucking dog?  But for you, it's easy. 
[01:18:30]  You got the backyard and all, and you got people that would pick up the dew.  I don't need that.  I don't want dew in my yard.  I don't want a dog in my house ever.  I don't want them fucking, you know, chewing shit up and having an accident.  And I don't...  And it's too time-consuming.  I'm too fucking lazy.  I'm too self-centered.  I come home, I want to sleep.  Jimmy, you hear this?  I don't want to walk a dog.  I ain't letting you off the hook on this one.  Why?  You're scared if you get a dog that you'll actually love something.  I absolutely would, probably.  You don't want to fall in love with anything. 
[01:19:00]  I loved little Jack-Jack.  You would see that dog with the big eyes and you'd fall in love with it.  And you can't handle that feeling.  Oh, oh, oh.  Right, Jimmy?  No, I get all annoyed at it that I have to fucking take it for a walk.  No, you wouldn't.  You know that eventually it would leave you via death.  Yes, they all do.  And you all know how to handle this.  See?  Stop, what is that?  That is a cute, dumb face.  That's what scares you, Ed.  Oh, my God.  Every time you see a cute animal on TV, you lose your mind.  What is that? 
[01:19:30]  Is that like a chocolate retriever or something?  That's a Weimaraner.  Oh, it's a Weimaraner puppy.  They're very smart dogs.  That's a Weimaraner puppy?  It's so cute.  That's not how you say that name.  Weimaraner, yeah.  Weimaraner.  How cute is that thing?  I just want to drill my fist into it.  Right into his little dog ribs.  He's looking up for a little nuzzle, and then you hear, poof.  They grow up really big, right?  Yeah, they're very cute.  I don't need a dog.  That's a good dog, Ed.  You have a great house for a dog, too, dude.  No, yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Great house for them to rip the fucking thing.  They don't rip things apart.  Get a great hound.  Great hounds just sit there.  They get wet when you take them outside in the rain, and then they shake off, and then  they take their wet fucking paw all over, and then you walk in the house and go, oh, great.  You got a dog?  That's my wet dog.  Dude, you don't have, first of all, you don't have a lot of rugs.  You have floor.  I have rugs.  You have some.  And then you have people clean your house, so it's like anything that happens, they just  clean up.  No.  They wreck things.  Get a dog.  No.  I want to pet it when I'm there.  Rent one for me.  You want to go, shooka, shooka, under the chin? 
[01:20:30]  No, under where the balls meet the asshole, like that spot.  Dogs love when you scratch them there.  They get very confused.  They were like, what is this guy doing?  They don't know if they should bite you or make cummy all over your wrist.  Cummy.  I take my thumb and pointer finger of my left hand, and I lift the ball, and then I go,  shooka, shooka, shooka on the vein.  And then the dog opens its asshole.  He looks back at you with his little eyes to the side and goes, makes that wacky tongue 
[01:21:00]  out of the mouth thing, like when they're taking a diarrhea.  Does your dog take a diarrhea?  He doesn't know how to just stand in one spot.  They're kind of walking, swatting, going, blinking.  I do it when he's on his back.  And then what happens is his leg begins to kick, and he looks at me ashamed, knowing that  what we're doing is technically homosexual, but he's like, look, this is instinct.  I can't help it.  My leg's moving.  I saw Anthony and how he acted in front of Jack Jack, his cat.  I love little Jack Jack.  Trust me, this man would love a pet.  Little Jackie Jack. 
[01:21:30]  You would love a pet.  You should get a pet.  Get one of those fucking, like, real ugly dogs that barely has any hair on it.  No.  Ugh.  A Mexican hairless?  Is that what it's called?  That's what I get when I go down to Mexico.  All right.  Should we take a break?  Hey, Dan, I don't know if there's anything to this, but could you Google right now?  Gary Glitter.  Uh-oh.  Oh, there's something to that.  A news Google or a regular Google?  Let's go with a news Google. 
[01:22:00]  A news Google.  I want to see if I got some good information or not.  Did I get good information?  What?  Did I get good information today?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Hey.  Oh, it's fucking not good information.  What does the headline say?  It says, well, depict fictional hanging of glam rocker Gary Glitter.  Oh.  All right.  I got info that they sentenced Gary Glitter to death.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, that was fictional.  Yeah, it's fictional.  They're doing it for whatever, a show or something.  You hear about that child murderer and molester in, I believe, Saudi Arabia?  I finally agree with the Saudi justice system.  Holy shit, are they fucking harsh.  What happened?  I don't know.  Wow.  This guy molested children, left a three-year-old to die out in the desert.  Didn't he kill a kid, too?  Or he was just a real child rapist?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A child rapist and murderer.  And boy, those Saudis don't take kindly to it. 
[01:23:00]  But a crucifixion, Saudi style, which is they behead them publicly.  And we all know how pleasant an experience that looks like.  And then they put him on a stake, on a big stick there, and display him.  Display him for all to see.  Here is what happens to you if you're a child murderer and molester.  I agree with them on that one.  When you fuck a three-year-old and leave it in the desert to die, you should be beheaded and crude. 
[01:23:30]  That is exactly what should happen to you.  But when they do the public beheading, I mean, think about that.  Who shows up for that?  Well, that's hard to get, like, Yankee tickets.  Imagine all of a sudden they announce Bloomberg goes, well, today at noon we're going to have a public beheading.  How many people are actually leaving work to check that out?  Everyone.  Go to Central Park.  You would check it out?  Everyone would check it out.  That would be rough.  Maybe I would check it out from a distance, maybe.  With your eyes, like, with your hand in front of your eyes, like a horror movie? 
[01:24:00]  Up on a hill in the background, maybe.  I watch it like I watched The Ring the first time I saw it.  Oh, this is scary.  But do you think the Saudis get really excited when they say, hey, a public beheading is happening today?  Dude, yes.  They fill up, they used to fill up soccer stadiums, the Taliban.  Well, that's because they kicked the head around for a while.  Oh, would they?  Yeah.  Goal.  It's called Chop Chop Square.  In Saudi Arabia, yeah.  I've seen the Chop Chop Square.  I understand all that, but people actually come out in droves.  Oh, no.  That's so fucked up.  But it's amazing how he's Googling it.  Human rights organizations are saying that it's wrong.  It's like, if a guy is a murderer, that's one thing, or a religious crime. 
[01:24:30]  When you fucking, can we agree in the world that if you rape a three-year-old and leave  it to die, that a beheading and a crucifixion is a Jim Dandy punishment?  It's just.  It's fucking perfect.  Yeah.  Good for the Saudis.  They shouldn't listen to anybody on this.  Yeah.  But then again, they also have something where if a daughter is unpure, they will bury her  up to her neck and throw rocks at her face.  I don't say that there aren't flaws in the system.  I just say that once in a while, regardless of how sociopathic you are, you're going to  hit the nail on the head occasionally. 
[01:25:00]  And they do here.  That's a good point, though.  If you don't smile facing Mecca, they take your clit and they fucking punt it.  All right.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  With one of those little gardening spade shovels, they just gouge it out.  Yeah.  You think that's in the Koran somewhere?  I doubt it.  The whole clit thing?  No, I think that's just a sexual lie.  An interpretation.  Everything happens in the Bible, supposedly.  So why not all that crazy stuff in the Koran?  Hey, you might want to explain yourself, Jimmy. 
[01:25:30]  Boobie Man in Brooklyn writes, did Jimmy just say, when you fuck a three-year-old  and leave it to die?  Oh, right.  Yeah.  Well.  Meaning, you might be more outraged that you left it to die.  You're sort of okay with the fucking of the three.  No, no, no, no.  Yeah, I guess that didn't come out wrong.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Let me clarify.  This is the type of thing a politician.  Let me clarify.  Right.  But if you commit that kind of crime, you're just, you're a fucking, you're subhuman,  and we should have no mercy for you.  Unless you're so retarded that you legitimately don't know it's wrong. 
[01:26:00]  No, even that.  The world doesn't need you.  Retarded people, though, I think we have to show us.  The world doesn't need you.  No, for real.  That's how I think.  I agree with you.  But retarded people can't help.  Like, if someone who's genuinely, I don't mean, like, legally crazy.  I mean, really fucked up.  Then they should be taken care of in the womb.  How about this?  How about when the animals attack at zoos?  They can't help themselves, but we fucking kill those fucking animals.  Dude, I agree with you.  There's something obviously wrong with the animal for doing what it was supposed to do.  You can't put a little party hat on them and set them free.  It's kind of a, you know, what are you going to do? 
[01:26:30]  Fuck that.  Anyone, I don't care who you are.  If you fuck a child, you should die.  But die.  I don't want to hear the reason.  And by covering it up, though, it usually means that you're not crazy enough to know  it was wrong.  Right.  If you fuck a child and then just, you know, sit there with it, you know what I'm saying?  You're a nut.  There are people who are genuinely nuts, but I have empathy for them.  This guy's got a real humdinger of a day coming up for him.  Good.  And his head chopped off.  What a fucking way of vermin to do.  Kurt knows a little bit about the Saudis.  Kurt, what do you got on the Saudis? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, you might want to double check it, but I had a buddy over there and they said when  you're in traffic before the beheading, the police just direct you into the stadium and  you're forced to watch it.  Oh, I am?  So you might want to double check that.  Wait, they force you to watch it?  Yeah.  It's like an Islanders game.  They close down Headstead Turnpike and start letting people into the Coliseum.  I appreciate the humor, but you better update your Islander info.  What, four in a row or five?  Four in a row, my friend. 
[01:27:30]  And by the way, I found out that Stephen S. from Bayshore is an Islander fan.  Yeah.  And I invited him to a game.  Oh, mistake.  How much fucking money do I have to bring for beers?  Mistake.  A lot of beer.  Probably food, too, man.  Can he keep his racism down to a fucking murmur?  Well, it's hockey.  How bad could it be?  Exactly.  What is there, one there?  There's probably one.  And then, you know, as far as the other part, the other, you know, thing goes, religious  thing goes with him.  How many of them are hockey fans, really?  That's true.  Well, I think it's probably the best place you could take them.  I'm bringing Stephen S. from Bayshore to a fucking hockey game. 
[01:28:00]  Wow.  That's right, Stephen S.  You're brave.  Very brave.  Got some extra pocket money for me?  Pocket money.  You take them.  Wait, what did Sam say about E-Rock?  He ran out of pocket money.  Pocket money.  Pocket money.  But it was so funny.  He ran out of pocket money.  Well, that necklace was in my closet for a while.  Was it?  Yeah.  So you need a pet and you need to get her back.  No, I don't need her back.  Then stop commenting on her.  I just can't help it. 
[01:28:30]  I like her hair now.  I'm just going to give a compliment where it's due.  Yeah, sure.  I like her hair now.  It looks much better than it did when it was that fake color.  I still like her natural color.  I don't know why she went back to that.  A lot of people saying that you should have went after Jodie Sweetin yesterday.  I'd be on that shit in a second, yo.  Did you make any of your moves?  No.  Jesus.  Talk about Myth Girls with Baggage.  That one would probably really be a handful.  Perfect for you.  A kid.  A fucking kid.  Get her off the wagon, man. 
[01:29:00]  Fucking.  Imagine her walking around the compound.  At my house, too.  With the fucking, hey, hey, sweet and sweetie, could you go down and get me fucking ten Guinness?  You know.  She's watching the game.  I'm down in beers.  We're going to watch her closely.  Yeah.  I made a joke at the end of the video, but.  Did you?  If she's not, she's going to be against.  You can't brag about being sober after ten months.  I would, yeah, I'd give that a try.  Of course you would. 
[01:29:30]  Although there would be a baby in my house.  Would she be living or just kind of?  Yeah, she would live there.  So one of my rooms would have to become like a nursery?  Dude, you got 80 rooms.  Who cares?  Yeah, but.  You have rooms you've never seen.  All you know one could be already.  Why do they scream that?  Why do they scream that?  I don't know.  Jody Sweetin, huh?  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut.  I did not forget about the Winter Classic.  Where are we at with that?  Do we have our fucking tickets, Danny?  Oh, is that when they're playing at the fucking baseball stadium? 
[01:30:00]  I'm supposed to bring Danny, too.  Where are they playing?  Giant Stadium.  Where the fuck are they playing?  Fucking Fenway.  Fenway.  How the fuck do I get tickets for that?  Sirius XM has NHL hockey.  I'll promote the shit out of it.  Get me some tickets to the Winter Classic.  When is the Winter Classic?  Like January 1st or 2nd, right?  Is it Saturday?  Huh?  What day of the week is it?  I don't know.  It's around that time.  Well, then everyone's off.  Jim, put that gun away.  Everyone's off because it might be New Year's Day.  It is New Year's Day.  New Year's Day.  Outdoor hockey in Boston at Fenway.  I gotta be there.  Yeah, that sounds like something I want to do. 
[01:30:30]  Sit in Fenway in January.  Dude, you get.  I never liked going from one bar to another in Faneuil Hall because it was too cold and  windy in January.  You got dressed apart.  You get some fucking.  Fuck that noise.  You get some fucking North Face shit.  Freezing cold.  You'll be all right.  Blustery freezing cold winter classic.  You're gonna watch hockey in freezing cold weather.  Why?  Because it's, it's, they only do it once a year?  Go inside!  It's so cool to see these hockey games outdoors.  They always do it there? 
[01:31:00]  No, they switch it around.  Go in Miami.  Or, yeah, fucking.  No.  That's too hot.  One year it was snowing.  You're right.  One year it was snowing as they're trying to play an NHL game.  That's kind of cool.  It was awesome.  I mean, they're cool.  They did basketball.  Now that'd be interesting.  Big cocks and shorts.  Sliding on the ice.  Yeah.  I'm taking my invite back.  I don't want to take Steven S. to a hockey game.  He said you would, though.  Yeah, I don't want to take him, though.  You already told me you would.  Why?  I know.  I just decided.  Why?  I can't be seen with him.  Let the guy, the guy's not that bad. 
[01:31:30]  Nobody knows him.  He's just a lunkhead.  Hey, why wasn't he at my fucking Halloween party?  Because he, he's not, he's a fair weather, uh.  He really is.  Gestapo.  Yeah, I don't.  Let's cut our, let's cut our ties with that guy.  Hey, Steve, you dick.  Why weren't you at my fucking party?  Maybe he was.  Yeah.  I have no idea.  Exactly.  Maybe he showed up late.  Oh, that's great.  He's the guy in the white hood.  You just thought it was, are you dressed as a ghost?  Nope.  Nope.  You know what, though?  We didn't touch on the fact that I do love E-Rock. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  Love E-Rock.  What do you mean?  Why did you say no?  Nothing, actually.  I'm fascinated with hearing why now.  Because he made.  Oh, the Reggie Jackson thing.  He made that happen.  He talked to the producer, and I have to tip.  Oh.  I don't want to say tip my hat, but say the company helped me.  The guy, Reggie's producer, just asked for me.  You know, he just, I can ask.  Really?  I can't guarantee it.  And he asked him on the way up the elevator, and I was there like a good boy with my baseball.  Wow.  And there was nobody in the lobby here. 
[01:32:30]  And, uh, so fucking Reggie walks in, and, uh.  Does he look good?  He looks great.  I mean, he doesn't play it in 25 years, probably.  Dude, he looks fucking great.  What did E-Rock get out of it?  A thousand Reggie bars?  And he walks in, and Reggie is kind of a business, you know, no fucking, again, he's been Reggie since 75.  I mean, everyone, here he goes.  People want something for him.  So he walks in, and he's like, uh, all right, uh, Jim Norton, the guy told my name, he had no idea. 
[01:33:00]  He'd never seen me before in my life.  Oh, really?  For a second, were you like, oh, no.  Not even, because he looked over, and he saw me, and he goes, all right, Jim Norton, the way he waved me, he just kind of, like, waves you over.  Get over here, business, let's go.  And I took the picture, and then E-Rock walked in, and, uh, and Reggie goes, okay.  And just waved him over, and E-Rock, his dummy, is thanking the producer.  And I'm like, fucking take the picture.  Get down with the fucking guy.  And, uh, I got him to sign a baseball.  Wow.  And, uh, that's pretty cool.  It's fucking, he's one of my, he's probably, he's my favorite athlete of all time. 
[01:33:30]  Wow.  And, uh, he does a show here from 7 to 8 on Tuesdays, but I don't know if he's going to do any more.  I hope he does.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.  That is a big one.  Fucking Reggie.  Yeah.  It's Reggie.  I was, I was as fucking starstruck as I've ever been.  Is he tall?  No.  No?  He's a little, you can see my photo with him, and.  Oh.  He's a little taller than me, and he's still, he's still in fucking.  Well, I thought he was a tall guy.  No.  He's, he's still a bulky guy.  Like, he's obviously a powerful dude.  He's not a, he's, he's still in shape, but, you know, again, he's an older, but no, he's  only a little taller than me. 
[01:34:00]  We got the pick right here.  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, yeah.  That's Reggie Jackson, all right.  Fucking Reggie.  He looks good.  He doesn't look much older than he did fucking 20 years ago.  The hairs are gray, that's all.  Yeah.  Why do black don't crack?  Yeah, but why do black guys get whiter as they get older?  I don't understand that.  He is a little lighter than he used to be.  I don't understand that.  What happened?  The melanin must leave the, what happened?  What happened?  The very scientific thing with black people when they get older.  Morgan Freeman, at this point, is pretty much a white guy.  White guy with freckles.  No, it's just that the flashes on the camera get better, so they look white.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Look at me.  I look invisible. 
[01:34:30]  Looks like, it looks like an older white gentleman with an invisible lump.  It looks like Reggie is standing next to a tumor.  Reggie does just kind of look tan.  When Stephen Lynch called, instead of freckles, what did he call them at the Carnegie Hall  show?  Bleckles?  Oh my God.  He had a word for black guys that have freckles.  It just killed.  Was it bleckles?  Could you pop up an older picture?  I'm trying to fix it.  I don't know.  I didn't hear it.  I didn't either.  It's all right.  Could you pop up an older picture of Reggie? 
[01:35:00]  I want to see.  Reggie old Martinez Jackson.  Oh, well.  I want to see Reggie Jackson.  Look how much dark he is.  The second one in.  Oh, he played with the orange?  Pop that motherfucker up.  God damn Reggie's black.  Get the fuck out of here.  Come on.  What happened?  What happened to Reggie?  What happened?  It's the same guy.  Dude, he was black there.  Come on.  What the fuck, man?  He's got that vitiligo.  Wow, man.  Dude, what happened?  Black guys get less black as they get older.  They really do.  That is weird. 
[01:35:30]  It's a strange phenomenon.  Hmm.  Oh, Reggie's not thrilled to be taking that picture.  Dude, he's been doing that.  He could care less.  Of course.  I don't blame him, though.  He's been doing that literally for 40 years.  I think he's...  I want to guess that he's...  But that's his job.  Not anymore.  That's what he does.  Yeah, why not?  What else does he have to do?  He's popular, and people want to give him accolades and ask for his autograph.  So be fucking magnanimous, motherfucker.  I'm kidding, of course.  Eric got...  Today he went home?  Oh, yesterday?  Did he really? 
[01:36:00]  Well, he came back healthy.  Are you kidding?  He said he came back just for you, Jimmy.  Yeah, he did for me, actually.  He helped set the whole thing up, and he ran back and got it for you.  He did that.  He did that.  He did that.  Did he?  Good job.  But it's fucking...  Yeah, so I want to promote his show if he still does it, man.  Fuck.  I asked him if he'd come on the show.  Fuck Reggie.  And he goes, I'll call in.  He doesn't want to get up in the morning.  He ain't calling.  Boy, those were some days.  Reggie ain't calling us.  Yeah, he would.  To promote his show, I think he would.  Yeah.  No, it ain't happening.  I disagree.  All right, get it going.  That's the only thing to re-up his contract.  You would assume Reggie would continue his radio show until the fucking World Series is over. 
[01:36:30]  That's up to the company.  I know it was a Mr. October thing, but, I mean, the World Series is still happening,  so you would assume they would make him some kind of contract that ends when the World Series ends, no?  Yeah.  You would think.  We've got to take a break, but...  Hey, Matt.  I want Reggie on the phone.  Hey, Matt, can you wait through the break?  Yes.  You can, huh?  Yeah, I'll wait through the break.  Or if you want, you can call back, and we'll make sure you got the easy pass to the show.  What? 
[01:37:00]  Very good.  All right.  If you hang up, that's fine, and we'll get to you, though.  That's a good story about the correctional officers.  Oh, shit.  And the dog.  Yeah, we'll talk to Matt after the break.  And also the child porn thing with the officer.  Jesus, what was this guy fucking thinking?  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony, take it, Travis.  A quick music thing. 
[01:37:30]  Bono says rock music might be over because U2's last album didn't sell well.  What a self-important fuck.  I went to his giant stadium show, U2's giant stadium show.  There were 70,000, 80,000 people there.  Yeah.  So how could he say rock music is dead?  What happened here was U2 put out a so-so album.  I'm a big U2 fan, and I bought the album, man, for real.  Yeah.  I couldn't name a song on it because I listened to it twice, and I wasn't feeling it. 
[01:38:00]  And it's in my dashboard, in my glove compartment right now, just hanging out.  See?  And now normally U2.  It's not on my iTunes.  It's not on my iPhone that I've been tinkering with.  You'd have been rocking it.  Yeah.  And now what?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They just put out an okay album.  That's why no one bought it.  Oh.  I don't think rock music is dead, do you?  And that's...  How pomp is it him to say that?  You know, that it's dead.  He's mad. 
[01:38:30]  Please.  So...  Do I sound lower in the mix?  Uh, did I turn this down?  I don't know.  My headphones all of a sudden sounded a little lower.  Yeah, that's a little better.  Oh, so I got it just over here.  Ah.  I'm officially going deaf, by the way.  What?  And my in-laws know it.  And I know they're talking about me behind my back about it.  They don't have to, uh...  No, they're...  I think they're frustrated with me because, like, we go to restaurants and stuff and we're  all, like, kind of talking as a family and I'm, like, I'm out of all these conversations.  What'd he say?  And I know they're probably whispering, like, oh, boy. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I know he's a bit older than my daughter, but, Jesus, I didn't know he was deaf, too.  He's going deep.  It's bad.  It's bad.  Like, I'll hang out at FH Riley's.  If I'm at a restaurant or a bar where there's a lot of other noise going on, I have a tough  time listening to conversations at my table.  I always have.  I got to get, like, turned one ear and kind of, like...  You, too, right?  Yeah, it's the bands and the radio.  The one-on-one stuff, I'm good still.  In a room like this, I'm good.  I hear everything. 
[01:39:30]  I just want to be able to walk around with a mic and headphones all the time so you could  hear everything from everybody.  Just walk around, go out on a date, give her a microphone.  Can you imagine we come in here with big fucking hearing aids?  What, are you fucking kidding me?  Yes.  Are you kidding me?  God damn.  But then I have been told that they're so tiny, you don't even know you have it on.  You won't even know.  Like the Steve Austin bionic.  Supposedly it looks like a little, like, hair popping out of your ear.  That's good.  Needs that. 
[01:40:00]  Let's go to Matt in Virginia.  Matt.  Matt.  Finalist.  Hey.  Sorry to make your way, Matt.  No, the problem, I was talking about the five correctional officers who have been charged  with animal cruelty for sexually disciplining their police dog.  Why do they have to sexually discipline it?  That's, I read that story too, and that confused me.  Well, apparently they're being very vague, but their lawyer came out and said what they  were doing was not considered cruel.  I think they were making the dog make cumzies to make it more docile. 
[01:40:30]  But they videoed, there's two separate types of videos in the whole thing.  Oh my God.  Were they doing a Cartman Red Rocket on them?  How were they doing this?  I have no idea.  How do you bring yourself to, say, giving your dog cumzies?  Make your dog go cumzies.  Well, honestly, I mean, the way to do it, you can use the pointer finger and thumb, but  the mouth is more effective.  It's not gay if you're just doing it to calm the dog.  Yeah.  Yeah.  As long as you spit it out afterwards, you don't make the yummy noise. 
[01:41:00]  But everyone makes a mistake.  What was the mistake these guys made?  They filmed it?  Well, I think they were turned in by one of their prison guards.  And they videotaped it twice.  I think they videotaped all the training sessions for some reason.  I have no idea.  Now, we need some experts to call the show.  Is this something that is done?  To make them more docile?  You know a thing or two about animals in general and horses and whatnot.  Is this a procedure you do to kind of calm these dogs down? 
[01:41:30]  All I can say is, as far as human beings go, I know after cumzies, you are a lot more docile  and, you know, kind of just kind of, ah, ah, that's good.  Yeah, I'm very calm.  And, oh, my God, I heard something on the way in.  It was a commercial, actually, for a play that's on, but they had some kind of factoid beforehand  talking about how women, back in the oldie days, would get what they called hysteria back then, 
[01:42:00]  where they would be anxious and a little wild, cranky, things that you would attribute now to, like, PMS.  They'd be like that, confused, whatever the fuck.  Confused.  Confused.  Like dumb dogs.  Dummies.  And they would go to the doctor for what was called a pelvic massage until the, and they said they would continue the pelvic massage  until they had the adequate result, which is the woman orgasm. 
[01:42:30]  It has to be.  So they would, because these women, I guess, would be so wound up from not getting laid  that they would have to be masturbated to calm them down.  Wow.  That's a great job.  What a gig being that doctor.  Although, some of those fat farm women probably.  Who cares?  The fatties would be the best.  You want, like, the fucking, uh.  Because, you know, they really want it.  Ugh.  No way.  You'd have to put on a fucking, uh.  You want, like, the Ingalls girls to come in. 
[01:43:00]  You'd have to put on, like, a glove like you give me a birthing a fucking horse or a mule.  But, uh, yeah, pelvic massage was given to the, from the doctors, I guess.  I don't know.  Uh, well, now we got a lot of people calling, and it says, worked at vet, I used to jerk off dogs.  What the fuck, man?  I want to start with, uh, Roger, the trucker.  Roger, what are you hauling today?  Uh, Mopar Parts.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Roger.  I got a buddy, uh, from Kansas City.  He's a hunter. 
[01:43:30]  Uh, old dog by the name of Buckshot.  Uh, old skier, he said, uh, best way to take his dog hunting is, uh, jerky mop before he goes.  If not, he's all about the bitch set.  But doesn't the fucking dog look at you differently after you jerk it off?  Oh, he's got him.  He's got him.  Like, I...  I never jerked him off, so I couldn't tell you.  Later, boys.  Oh, please.  All right.  My friend jerked his dog off.  My buddy, Jimmy, he's dead.  Um, he, uh...  Sorry about the dead part.  That's all right.  He, uh, he jerked his dog off out of my arm one time. 
[01:44:00]  Why?  We had pre-cum on.  His dog's name was Fred.  No, stop it.  His dog's name was Fred.  Yeah, I believe, sir, he was teasing his dog's penis.  He was like a little weird schnauzer type mutt, and, uh, he got it to, like, get, like,  pre-cum on my arm or something.  It was awful.  Why would he...  Why...  Well, how did you have your arm that close?  I was young.  I didn't know what he was doing.  I mean, I didn't realize he was doing it until he put it on my arm.  That's always some other fucking story with you.  He passed away.  He passed away.  You know, the old shotgun in the mouth.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And he was a friend of yours?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  From childhood. 
[01:44:30]  Damn.  Wow.  Wow.  How old was he?  I want to say he was in his 20s.  He was married.  What was that?  So you just wanted to say that.  Yeah.  He was in his 20s, married, and then swallowed a shotgun.  I think right in front of his mother.  Yeah, they said in front of his mother.  I don't know.  Hey, mom.  In front of his mother.  I think he had substance abuse problems from what I remember, and that might have been it.  He was a good guy, but I just...  He just kind of had some...  That's brutal.  Look, for all the people out there that are thinking of killing themselves, don't do it in front  of your mother. 
[01:45:00]  That's what I heard.  We at least agree on that.  In front of anybody.  Yeah, but I mean, nah, if they're going to do it, they're going to do it, and that's  what I'm thinking.  Just fucking leave your mom out of it.  I think you get a body bag from some fucking surplus thing, and you zip yourself up in  it after you do everything so that when someone finds you, you're already pre-packaged.  That's really smart.  You're ready for the coroner that's all used to that shit.  Fucking, yeah.  So no one's got to look and go, oh my god, why?  And see fucking blood on the walls and all kinds of shit.  Keep it nice and clean.  Yeah, and then you put a little 8x10 photo of you on top of it, all nice and your better 
[01:45:30]  days.  There was a house on Cherry Lane going very local where the kid killed himself.  I'm not sure if it was...  I don't remember.  It's been so many years.  I think he hung himself, though.  And you know, the fucking real estate market was so shitty that the family still had to  fucking live in the house.  Ooh, that's...  How bad is that?  Don't go past that room.  Right.  Stay out of that room, doc.  You're fucking living a horror movie for the rest of your life. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, I don't know the exact circumstances.  Because most people want to fuck out when that shit happens.  But if the real estate market sucks, you're stuck.  They usually move.  You think fucking Lou Costello went swimming every day after that?  Right.  Tommy Lee.  Let's go to Kevin in Vegas.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Hi, Kevin.  And what do you have for us?  Thank you.  Sorry we didn't have excitement back at you.  We just got a little tired there for a second.  That's all right.  I was wondering why you'd ever want to make a police dog more docile. 
[01:46:30]  Well, I guess maybe a drug dog or something.  Was it one of those dogs they send out to go running after fucking people?  You don't want them docile.  It's obvious.  You don't want your police dog sniffing female dog pussy when it's supposed to be smelling  for fucking drugs or something.  Yeah, it's true.  Oh, my God.  The Red Rocket.  The Red Rocket episode for...  Episode.  That's not the part.  How do they get away with that?  He can't even his mouth.  And we can't even do an Asian accent.  Well, now we can because we're on satellite.  But how the fuck do they get away with the dog cumming in Cartman's face and mouth, actually? 
[01:47:00]  Jesus.  And one of the biggest advocates for Asian people has now got better things to do.  John Liu.  John Liu got elected.  Yeah, good for you, John Liu.  What is he now?  I'll never forget you.  Comptroller or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll be watching him very closely.  Yeah, let's watch for any imprieties.  All right, let's get a hot story on the air finally.  Michelle, Pennsylvania.  Michelle?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I used to work for a veterinary clinic, and they worked with high-end breed dogs, and 
[01:47:30]  they wouldn't let the male and female breed for fear that the male would hurt her.  Uh-huh.  So the doctor used to jerk the male off all the time.  I mean, we had to hold the dog as the distance, and he'd jerk the dog off, and then he would  inseminate the female.  It was really very messed up to watch.  Like artificially inseminate?  Right, so he would jerk off and collect the jizz, and then you'd, like, squirt it in  there or something?  And then you'd squirt it in the female, yeah, because they didn't want the male to injure  the female. 
[01:48:00]  That's just what he told you?  Yeah.  He was just a creep.  He'd put the dog up on her shoulders and say, listen, you can't swallow it.  Yeah.  Spit it into the syringe.  Spit it into this dog's vagina.  Yeah.  She'd have to take it in the mouth, and the doctor would hold the vag open.  And she'd have to put her lip coat, and she was blowing up a balloon, and the dogs would  have confused looks on their faces.  I'm sorry.  One of my favorite stories from college, I had a roommate.  I've told this story a couple times, so I'll just tell the quick version. 
[01:48:30]  His job, we all had dumb college jobs.  I washed dishes at the fucking, you know, mess hall.  Yeah.  Whatever, the cafeteria.  His job on Saturday mornings and Sunday mornings was to jerk fucking horses off.  Yes, I've seen that done.  Not actually jerk them off, but to make sure the horse's penis went into the horse vagina.  And he would dress for work, I swear to you, in a rain slicker.  In a slicker.  Because this fucking horse would just spray everywhere.  My cum goes off like a sprinkler.  Right.  That was his gig. 
[01:49:00]  That's like loading a fucking torpedo into a torpedo tube.  He's just got to grab it and fucking, hey, shove it on in.  Oh, he was miserable, but that was the best he could do to make a little extra money at college was fucking hold horse dick.  Do you think the horse ever looks down and goes, I know.  I don't need, do you see little horsies?  Done it.  We know what we're doing.  Thank you.  Done it before.  What arrogant humans to teach a horse to fuck?  They know what to do.  They run and fuck.  Isn't it great, though, when you feel like that hand coming from under your leg and got your cock in there? 
[01:49:30]  I could usually, I'll hit it from fucking, you know, three feet away on a single thrust.  I got like fucking, like, radar on the tip of my dick.  But I wouldn't want it from another species.  No, no, you wouldn't want a hoof.  Like, that would be like a hoof grabbing your dick and guiding it in.  Or a fucking silverfish.  Little hands marching your weenie in.  Imagine a silverfish grabbing your cock.  It's like, what are you doing?  I know, SF.  Let's go to Brian in Texas.  Brian.  Hey, what's up, Brian? 
[01:50:00]  I used to work for a large animal vet, and we used to masturbate bulls to fertility test them.  And the way we did it, we put them in a chute, and I had a big vibrator.  It looked like a, kind of looked like a space shuttle with handles, with two handles, like, on the back of it.  Great description, yeah.  Go ahead.  And, uh, anyway, we got him in the chute, and then we shoved that vibrator in his ass and turned it on, and he'd get a big old hump in his back and start, you know, uh, oh, his dick would get large. 
[01:50:30]  And, uh, anyway, we'd get down there, it looked like a butterfly catcher with, like, a, uh, a plastic sock over it.  And we'd catch a little bit of drizzle that would come off the end of his dick.  Ew, a fucking bull likes a fucking thing in his ass?  What a sissy.  Do you know how embarrassed the bull must be when he can't control his hard dick or his pre-cum? 
[01:51:00]  He knows everybody's watching.  Because he's got the thing in his ass.  Because of instinct, he's like, oh, no, he's probably thinking of anything, like, like the fucking spurs in his side, the clown, anything to keep his dick from getting hard.  He's humiliated.  Can you imagine everybody setting you up and just putting something in your ass and then putting a sock on your dick?  Well, we know it's going to leak, sissy.  Here it comes.  Your fruit.  We know your cock is going to drool, sissy boy.  Too good.  We used to do, like, 12 at a time. 
[01:51:30]  We'd just run them in there.  He'd get a sample.  He'd go back in the back, stick it on a magnifying glass.  And I guess he did a count or something.  And I was just working the chute and just, I'd have to lube that vibrator up, too.  You're being called an actual bull prepper.  Yes, you are.  You prep the bull.  You prep the bull, literally.  Yep.  Oh, fuck.  Thank you for that one, Brian.  Let's go to Chuck in South Dakota.  Chuck.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Chuck.  Hey, man.  I used to work for a hog confinement.  My job was to take the boars up and down the aisles to see which sow was in heat. 
[01:52:00]  And then you'd take the boar in there.  And as he was mounted, you'd have to reach down there and grab his little corkscrew dick  and make sure it inserted to make sure that he would get the sow right.  Yes, you would.  Jesus, what a fucked up job that is.  Good job.  I think.  Wow.  You had to make sure the fucking dick went in the vent.  Yeah.  Yeah, you made sure you got the hog farm. 
[01:52:30]  Don't they have corkscrew dicks?  Yeah, he said that.  Yeah, corkscrew dicks.  Yeah.  That's why you'd have to help.  Why the fuck does he have a corkscrew dick?  I don't know.  So it stays in.  It's like his pigs are sort of slippery and she'd probably just run away and he can't  grab her because he has little teeny cloven hooves.  Well, you know, because the pigs, they lay in the mud all the time like that and when  it comes out and goes back in, you know, like a dog's red rocking, you know, it keeps  from the mud and they're not getting up in there and it's not infectious. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, God.  Jesus.  Thank you for that, Chai.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Let's go to big dick.  Daniel or who we got from California?  Daniel?  Yes, sir.  Daniel.  What's up, Mike?  Good morning, ONA.  Hey.  Mr. Norton, good morning.  I'll try to catch you on Houston this weekend.  Oh, yeah.  It's Thursday, tomorrow through Saturday.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Your good friend, Mike Rowe, has jerked off a pig and a bull.  Put a big old weenie in a bull tiny.  So you might want to look that up on YouTube.  But Mike does it when he's not even, has nothing to do with the show. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  He'll just do it to fucking, you know, for the goof when he's bored.  He's a dirty boy doing a dirty job.  Yeah.  Let's see if we can get the footage of Mike Rowe sticking a pole up some people's ass.  Thank you.  And getting back to the original story, we got a canine officer on the phone, Jason in  Georgia.  Jason.  Morning, boys.  Morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Jason.  I've been a canine officer for the last 10 years here in Georgia.  I've had three dogs.  That is not a training technique.  I'm an instructor. 
[01:54:00]  I teach guys how to do this stuff.  Yeah.  Do not use that.  We've got a tool called a Tritronics collar.  It's got a remote control on it.  It's got a little electronic box.  If you've got a dog that's a little too aggressive, you push a button on it, it gives him a little  electric jolt.  That's all there is to it.  You don't jerk the dog off.  Hey, what's the best dog for a police dog?  In my opinion, German Shepherds.  Oh, yeah.  That's all I've ever had. 
[01:54:30]  We've got Belgian Melanois.  And we've got Labs.  I like Shepherds.  I like female Shepherds.  They work better.  Dude, I was watching an episode of Cops the other day where they had aerial footage and  it was nighttime, but, you know, they fucking infrared the scene.  So they were looking for a guy and he was in the middle of the woods.  He starts running.  They let the dog loose and you just see like the night vision of this.  That dog took off so fast that fucker didn't have a chance and just grabbed him. 
[01:55:00]  And then at that point, they're screaming for the police to get there to get the dog off  of him.  Please take their time.  Get out.  Yeah, and the police is kind of mosey on over.  So, you know what?  The number one dog I'm scared of to this day is the German Shepherd.  Still.  Well, I got bit when I was a kid.  Pretty bad on my fucking left knee while I was doing my paper route.  But to this day, German Shepherds still do it for me.  What's the other one?  They scare the shit out of me.  Pit bulls and all that. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, I see a pit bull.  I'm a little intimidated, but German Shepherd, way more scared of the German Shepherd.  German Shepherds don't seem as unreasonable as a pit bull.  A pit bull just seems unreasonable.  Yeah.  Like, there's no way to fucking back it off.  So your number one dog is pit bull that you're scared of?  Yeah.  Because they can do the most damage if they bit you.  A shepherd, my impression, if it bites you, is not going to attempt to do the most damage  it possibly can.  Whereas a pit bull just strikes you as a type of animal because they're associated with  being fighting dogs.  Yeah, yeah.  You would know better.  You'd train them. 
[01:56:00]  I mean, is that true or am I wrong?  It all depends on the dog.  You can make, if you're mean to any kind of dog, it's going to tear your ass up.  And if you don't know what you're doing, the dog, no matter what kind of dog it is, isn't  going to come off the bite.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  When a German shepherd shows his teeth at you, that is a scary fucking look they got.  Are they pretty ferocious?  German shepherds? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, they are.  Mine are real protective of my family, especially.  Yeah, I bet.  Especially the females, they're real protective of the family and the handler.  Have you ever noticed dogs being, well, I guess I would just say, like racist?  Have you noticed certain dogs not liking certain other races?  Let's just say my last partner was a solid black German shepherd. 
[01:57:00]  And we're in Georgia, and let's just say, he didn't like a certain, didn't like a certain  Oh, so there was a certain racial, the dog did make certain racial distinctions.  Interesting.  It seemed to be that way.  Interesting.  All right, just asking.  People were, he knew who was on our side and who wasn't. 
[01:57:30]  Interesting.  All right.  I was in a little pet store, and I saw a picture of a fucking, a little German shepherd  puppy.  No, you didn't.  All curled up with his little leg on his back.  Oh, look at him.  Let me see that, Jimmy.  I took a little picture of him.  He was so fucking.  Thank you, Jason.  Hold on, let me get back.  Let me see that.  Hold on, let me get back.  I think I might want to get a German shepherd if I get a house.  Yeah?  Yeah, why not?  Good, good.  I mean, I'm scared of it, but if I did it as a fucking little fucking German shepherd.  Good guard dog.  Look, let me see this.  Isn't he cute in the glass? 
[01:58:00]  Aw!  Man, you got to get a fucking dog.  Nope.  Just do it.  Nope.  Cocker Spaniel has a harder bite than a pit bull.  Who knew this?  Let's say hi to Jason on Long Island.  Jason, how do you know this?  I'm actually a veterinary student.  Oh, okay.  So he knows, Jimmy.  He knows.  Yeah, but maybe, maybe, like, it's almost like saying an ant is stronger than a person  because of body weight and relativity, but your Cocker Spaniel is not going to hurt  you like a pit bull.  You have little mouths.  No.  No, it's all about the jaw muscles. 
[01:58:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  It has a harder bite than a pit bull.  Yeah, you kick it.  I would take a square inch.  I would take a bite from a Cocker Spaniel any day before.  I'd take a blowjob from a Cocker Spaniel before a pit bull or a German shepherd.  They nip.  They nip at you.  Hey, what could do more damage, a German shepherd or a Doberman?  It all depends on the dog.  You know, they all got sharp teeth and they all got hard bites.  Most of them, you know, except for them little shits.  What was the other one he was talking about?  The Belgian what?  Waffle. 
[01:59:00]  Love them.  That's not the dog, Ant.  Powdered sugar.  Can you imagine if that's what the cop did?  He opened the door and threw a Belgian waffle at you and you ate it.  And while you were eating it, the police arrested you.  That's how they got you.  That's how they arrested fat people.  Have a waffle, piggy.  You're under arrest, Mr. Rock.  You should have said Nagel.  Come here, Mr. Nagel.  You, stop, Belgian waffle.  Hands behind your back.  I can't. 
[01:59:30]  I'm eating.  Hands at your side, then.  So what was the Belgian dog you were talking about?  The guy, the cop?  I don't know.  Sir?  I don't know.  Is this guy here?  I don't know.  Is he still there?  I don't know.  That guy?  I don't know.  Actually, we got Kyle in Michigan.  Kyle.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  That happens every time I call, Ant.  I know.  I know.  And what are we supposed to say?  Yeah.  Your name's Kyle.  Exactly.  Hartman?  Hey, shitfarts.  How you doing?  It's your new name.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  I worked as a research biologist, so I've jerked off basically everything.  All right.  You whore.  All right.  Give us the list of things you have jerked off.  Sexy.  Let's listen to Kyle and what he's jerked off.  Kangaroos, koala bears, elephants, a giraffe, which was amazing.  Which was amazing.  Did he crane his long neck down?  Like, what are you doing?  What's going on?  Turtle.  Okay.  Is there a turtle? 
[02:00:30]  His dick kept going in the shell because he was scared.  He was confused.  He's afraid you're going to skip across the pond with a heart on.  And we allowed him to move on with his list.  Why was the giraffe jerking off amazing?  Yeah.  Just because the end of it has basically got, like, barbed wire spikes on it to hold the  inside of the vagina.  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  Why do females like dick?  That they have to come up with spikes on the end of a penis? 
[02:01:00]  They need, like, grappling hook dicks.  Just enjoy it, will you?  Yeah.  Fucking lay down and have some fun.  Well, cats have the same thing, just on a smaller scale.  But when that happens, if they thrust back hard, it actually rips up your hand.  Wow.  Have you ever been cut on an animal cock?  I have.  That's the giraffe.  You got your hand cut with a giraffe cock.  We're watching two giraffes right now. 
[02:01:30]  There's a giraffe trying to mount the female.  And it's just so funny.  He's got a rod, and she's just kind of standing there, and he's trying to position himself  where he can just jump up and jam it in.  Yeah.  That's what animals do.  They wait until the chick's distracted, and then they just lock their fucking, their  interlocking fucking spike penis inside them and rape them.  And us humans don't do exactly that.  It's just total rape.  It's all about just distracting the female.  Wow.  Wow.  So this guy's jerked off a lot of things.  Give us some details on some of these animals and what happens when you jerk them off. 
[02:02:00]  Elephant cock.  Go.  Elephant cock.  Sure.  Let's start there.  Elephant cock is just kind of like the horse where you need a few people just to kind of  hold it up.  And they mount basically a big sawhorse-looking thing that has a sleeve on it.  Elephants have big, fat penises?  It's quite a weighty cock.  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Does he have big balls?  A weighty cock.  The turtle one, you just kind of put your pinky into a little hole at the base of the tail 
[02:02:30]  and just kind of rub really fast.  Ew.  And the asshole turtle just comes in his pants?  Turtles are fucking assholes.  They come in their shells.  Have some dignity, would you?  They make cumsies in their shells.  Fuck, any animal you can just make soup out of without even fucking taking it out of it.  All you got to do is fucking turn a turtle upside down and throw water on it.  Delicious.  Go ahead.  Turtles are fucking idiots.  The koala kind of looks like a normal cock, but it's just really tiny. 
[02:03:00]  Wait a minute.  We're watching an elephant mount another elephant.  Wow.  The elephant cock moves like the trunk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's eating peanuts with it right now.  No, it does, though.  It curls up.  He's like trying to...  Could the female elephant show some interest?  No, she's eating grass.  She's just eating grass.  She's trying to hold the weight of that big fucking elephant.  Look at that thing on its back legs.  I'd imagine that's how we broadcast sex.  Six feet tall.  Oh, E-Rock.  Everybody politely looks...  That's a beautiful animal, that Belgian fucking shepherd. 
[02:03:30]  Wow, is that nice?  Yeah, that's...  That's nicer than a German.  They're calling it a Belgian...  Wow.  Oh, boy.  I can't pronounce this one.  Mala, Illinois, Malinois.  Belgian Malinois.  Is that like a Belgian shepherd?  I believe so.  That's what Bobo's Peener from Ohio is saying.  Bobo's Peener is now a name.  Yeah, right.  I want a Belgian shepherd.  I want a dog.  Oh, you can't have one in a New York apartment.  It's just cruel to the animal.  Not if you have a Greyhound or something.  I have a one-bedroom. 
[02:04:00]  Anna, I'm thinking that our listeners have to go back to their normal names again so we  can get some respect in the business.  Never.  We can't post our stuff when we're getting phone calls from Bobo's Peener.  From the likes of...  Yeah.  Kyle, did you do anything else?  Do you think Dogshit Sniffer from Woodside is a fucking proud name?  But he's been calling in so long, to me, his name's Bob.  I don't even notice that his name's Dogshit Sniffer.  Kyle, what else you got?  Dogshit Sniffer.  Well, first, I didn't use my board name just for this reason for this fucking call. 
[02:04:30]  What's your name?  Kick to the Uterus.  What is it?  Kick to the Uterus.  Kick to the Uterus.  Rebar can't touch, kick to the Uterus.  He spells a C-I-Q, so it's actually a real name.  Oh, okay.  Anything else on jerking off the animals?  No, it's just a living.  That sounds like one of those Flintstone things.  It's a living.  The stork underneath the fucking sink eating the garbage.  Kyle, how old are you?  Jerking off animals. 
[02:05:00]  Almost 24.  So, I like asking this question when someone calls in with a weird job.  What did you want to be when you were a little kid?  Astronaut, baseball player, and it turns out you're true.  Olympian.  A what?  An Olympian.  Olympian.  So, instead of being an Olympian, you're jerking off exotic animals.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, nobody as a kid looks at an animal and goes, you know what?  I'd like to help that thing come into a sleeve.  Why does every kid say, I want to be a baseball player?  I want to be an astronaut.  Why is there one kid out there going, I want to jerk off animals for a living? 
[02:05:30]  No one.  Because it's jerking off animals.  All right, Kyle.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Dogs, college.  I want to pet an animal.  I guess.  You want more dog shit?  Well, it's disgusting.  They're all the same.  It's not going to end like we married and we have kids now.  This guy's a breeder.  Could answer Jimmy's questions.  Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Morning, boys. 
[02:06:00]  I can't compete with that caller, but I've read Rottweiler's German Shepherd.  The Rottweiler's fight is the hardest fight.  The second is the Shepherd.  And when you talk about feeding off of, we've bred them for several police units.  They definitely pick up the vibe off the owners.  So if you have a tendency to hear certain individuals, they'll pick up the vibe very quickly. 
[02:06:30]  I forgot about Rottweilers.  Those are used by police?  Yeah.  They're pretty strong fucking dogs, right?  Like if you get a big 125-pound Rottweiler, that's a big animal.  Rottweiler is used by police?  Yeah.  Really?  Where?  I never saw that.  I haven't seen that either.  Not as much as they were, but the pure German-bred Rottweiler is a bitch.  They are, I'm 5'10", about 220, and it's a battle.  I've seen Shepherds in labs like that.  I've actually gone to a new, we're going back to the original German Shepherd, the original breed. 
[02:07:00]  They've been overbred, and there's a kind of a hybrid called a Shiloh Shepherd.  That's a monster.  How big did it get?  20 feet tall.  The Shilohs, ours is still a baby, and it's about 115.  115?  How much will that fucking thing weigh?  140 to 150.  Jesus.  Wow.  And that's a lot of that's muscle, right?  Most of that's muscle?  Has to be.  Oh, this thing is, she thinks she's a lap dog, but she is huge.  She is. 
[02:07:30]  And she's just figuring out she's a big dog.  Wait, what is she called?  What is she called, bro?  I'm sorry.  The Shiloh Shepherd.  Oh, it's not like a Rottweiler.  Okay.  That is a bit, we're looking at pictures of it.  Holy fuck, that is a monster dog.  I don't think I've ever seen one of those live.  They're too hairy, though.  I would want one that's, uh...  We have a...  You don't like any, maybe you could shave down like every pussy you like, Jimmy.  I don't like dogs with hair, ew.  No, I don't want the long hair.  I like a short-haired dog.  Yeah.  We have the short-haired version of it.  Oh, you can get a short-haired version.  Okay. 
[02:08:00]  And ours is a silver, kind of a...  It's a really cool-looking dog.  So, and the intelligence is amazing.  Are they gentle?  Math?  Uh, no, it's figured out how to get in our house, though.  Oh, okay.  And how to, uh...  It's...  We found the pantry door open a couple times, and it's snacking, so...  Wow.  So, let me ask you a question.  Are they nice dogs to the family?  Oh, my...  The German Shepherd...  Our German Shepherd...  The Shepherds are amazing.  Uh, as a family dog and a guard dog, we'll leave the kids out with the dog. 
[02:08:30]  Is that dog protective?  Oh, my...  Let's put it this way.  I get the, uh, will the dog bite, and we don't...  Everybody, yeah.  It's a...  She's...  The German Shepherd is still a touch insane, but...  Mm.  Um...  They are...  They are an amazing dog.  I wouldn't have any other family dogs.  So, if you were walking your dog, and some stranger just gave you and your wife a slap,  would the dog defend you?  Jesus.  Uh, me?  Probably not.  My wife, it would probably tear its throat out. 
[02:09:00]  Wow.  So, uh, we've had people come near the property, and our Shepherd...  You can see the patrol lines.  I mean, they were bred to protect and kill.  So, they're an amazing dog, though.  You don't want them...  The intelligence and...  I'm sorry, buddy.  You don't want them to, like, attack your guests, though.  Your guests.  No, no, no, no.  No, I...  Don't get me wrong.  I mean...  But, as a...  To know...  With, uh, kids in this day and age, that anything that came by our kid would... 
[02:09:30]  There'd be no way that the individual would survive.  I hate going over people's houses, and the dog just sticks his nose right in your crotch,  starts sniffing.  It's just getting to know you.  Really?  That's easy shit.  Have you ever been to someone's house where they give you all sorts of rules about how  to, uh...  When you first approach it...  Right.  How to handle yourself in front of their dog.  Have one eye closed.  Right.  And you're like...  And have your left hand behind your back.  Make sure you don't move suddenly or anything. 
[02:10:00]  You're like, this isn't fucking relaxing.  I like this.  Let's go somewhere else.  Let's go to a Friday.  Don't show them you're afraid.  Right.  Right, right.  All that stuff.  I'm petrified.  They give you a whole list of things, and now you're sitting on their couch like, what  the fuck?  This dog's gonna bite me.  Yeah, thanks.  Chris, thank you.  We got one more story, and then we're gonna take a break.  By the way, at late-term abortions, writes, Brie Bart better respect my social comments.  I agree with you.  Rich in Virginia.  Rich, listen to this story, if it's true. 
[02:10:30]  Rich?  Yeah, this is true, guys.  It's funny.  A couple weeks ago, there was a guy that was outside.  His dog was being attacked.  I think he had a border collie or something like that.  And his dog was being attacked by a neighbor's pit bull.  And this guy was freaking out, and he went over there, and to defend his dog, he was  trying to beat the pit bull off of his dog, and reached with his hands into the pit bull's  mouth to try to release his dog from the pit bull.  Couldn't get it off. 
[02:11:00]  So as a last resort, he ends up biting the pit bull on the nose.  The pit bull heals, sits down, and licks the man on the face and releases his dog.  Get the fuck out of here.  He thought, like, you're the man.  He thought it was a fucking dog, right?  Wow.  You gotta be brave to pick your face by a pit bull face, though.  Hell yeah.  You'd have to, yeah, you just gotta sit there and watch the gore happen.  I'm not getting involved with a pit bull.  Holy shit.  I don't know.  Can you imagine? 
[02:11:30]  If a dog is attacking your kid, I guess your instinct is that you would literally...  Literally, all out.  All out.  No, I got two other kids.  He'll bite his penis off.  Ooh.  That would stop it.  You think?  I'll tell you, that Travis the Chimp tearing that lady's face off.  If she could have got that ape dick in her mouth, that would have ended the attack.  Too sweet.  Too sweet.  Hey, thanks, boys.  I'm punching out.  All right, man.  Later.  Hitler was a sport.  Demands recognition from brief party.  Oh, really?  Right.  I don't think that name is really going to be published. 
[02:12:00]  Hitler was a sport.  Golly, demands fucking recognition.  Demands respect.  Sean, New Jersey.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, man.  All right, all right.  Hey, listen.  You want to talk about big dogs?  They had a 240-pound English maskist.  Yeah, those are big dogs, too, huh?  Let's take a look at one of those.  They're all sloppy in the mouth, though.  Yeah, they're terrible.  What are those?  Are those the hooch dogs or the fucking?  Oh, like St. Bernard? 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Those are disgusting.  They have that fucking big mouth that just drips fucking slime.  You wouldn't have one of those dogs in the compound?  Oh, God.  I don't even like seeing them on the street.  Those sloppy dogs.  What the fuck are you thinking?  Just drool constantly coming out of their mouth.  Look at the size of the canis dogs in the world.  That's like a fucking, that's a prehistoric dog.  That dog looks like it's ready to fuck her.  But that's not very long-haired, either.  But you imagine walking down the street with that thing, a 200-pound dog?  She could not control that dog. 
[02:13:00]  No way.  There's no way.  That dog will do whatever it wants to do if it decided it wanted to do something.  But it's not smart enough to know that he can do anything.  His head's bigger than hers.  Exactly.  That's the problem, though.  Yeah, it's giant.  He thinks he's a tiny little fucking yip-yip dog.  It's still a little puppy.  Yeah, the picture right next to it.  How big is that one, buddy?  The one right next to it?  Dan, you, Dan, you, but Danny, Danny, what are you, holy shit.  Are you kidding me?  The dog was sticking its head out the passenger window right behind the driver's seat.  The dog's head is easily four times the size of the owner. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  Right?  Easily.  Huge.  Holy shit.  You got one of these, huh, Sean?  Yeah, I had one.  He actually passed away last year, so.  What do they live, like, a year and a half?  The fucking things.  Big dogs don't live that long.  Big, huge heart that's got a pump.  Yeah.  Hey, was it a nice dog?  Does it get angry?  What's its temperament?  Oh, it's beautiful.  Beautiful, man.  He did a train great with kids.  Yeah, fantastic.  They were just big lumps.  But if you were, if you, did you ever walk down the street with that thing and have people 
[02:14:00]  just get the fuck out of your way?  Yes.  Yes.  People cross the street.  Yeah.  When you walk that thing, they're like, uh-oh.  Oh, the dog.  So, right.  Right on.  And one more.  We're trying to go to break, but the calls are way too good today.  Charles, North Carolina.  Hey, man.  I don't have a story about a big dog, but when I was in college, there was a, we were having  a party and, you know, we thought we were all cool because we were like the seniors in  college. 
[02:14:30]  There were all these hot-ass freshman girls running around and we had our bird dogs out  and, uh, they started getting a little anxious and we put them outside and a dog fight broke  out and, uh, I stepped in the middle of it and got my dick bit really bad and, uh, you  know, all of everybody's laughing.  Sorry.  I mean, this is no joke.  I mean, the, the, the email is still floating around on the internet because, you know,  we went to the emergency room and all these like night nurses, they obviously thought we 
[02:15:00]  were some sort of degenerates, you know, because my buddies drove me in there and, uh, you know,  I have these bite marks on my cock and, uh, you know, everybody in the fucking hospital  is coming down and taking a look at it.  Like, look at these fucking perverts.  Uh, anyway, so we ended up leaving, uh, leaving the hospital and, uh, we took a picture of  it and then took a picture of the dog.  Now, like flash forward, like five months later, I get a, an email from my cousin who knows 
[02:15:30]  nobody that I know.  And he's up in New York city.  And, uh, the title of the email is Ford, Ford, Ford, Charles Smith's Dick is dog food.  And everything in it is like to the T accurate.  I mean, somebody had, so I guess somebody there had, had put the story along with it  and, uh, man, it was awful.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Can we find that on the internet?  That's the oven.  Yeah.  It's just off this dick is dog food.  There's a picture of a dog about a fucking girl and he has little booties on his feet. 
[02:16:00]  Little booties taped to his feet so as not to hurt the gal.  Oh, you know, the worst part was is, you know, my girlfriend, you know, my cock was, uh, you  know, when you get like extreme trauma to your dick, it's called, uh, it's called Peroni's  disease.  And, uh, she's like, well, can I just, can I just lick, lick it?  Can I just lick it and make it feel better?  I was like, yeah, I guess.  And, you know, it's, it's completely black with like a pink tip.  And, uh, whoa, whoa. 
[02:16:30]  When I was fucking coming in, uh, like a little bit of blood came out.  Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.  Yeah.  And I was like, uh, maybe that wasn't such a good idea.  Oh.  But, uh.  Enough of your story.  And you haven't lived until you, you, you know, came.  Yeah.  Oh.  In fucking dark red.  Ah.  Anyway, guys.  I'm punching out.  Holy shit.  I just got lost in my own fucking mind. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, uh, thank you for that.  Uh, Matt in Buffalo.  Matt.  Hey, yo.  Um, this is really, really huge dogs.  The Irish wolf hound is just a mammoth creature.  Is that the biggest one?  I don't know.  It's huge.  Irish wolf.  Is it bigger than the dogs we were just looking at, Danny?  What do you think?  Probably not.  Wow.  That's pretty fucking big.  They're not as like fat.  All these huge dog breeds are pretty similar in size.  Like all the giant dog breeds are equally giant.  Where are they though? 
[02:17:30]  You rarely see the giant dog breeds.  I saw one.  I saw one in New York in all my years living here.  Just one dog.  Where are they?  Are they in like Europe or something?  I don't know.  Everyone loves their dogs.  All right.  Look at them all loving their dogs.  Thank you, Matt.  Yep.  We're going to take a break.  Yeah.  I'm hungry.  Take a break.  I'm hungry.  All this dog shit.  Well, the child porn case we'll get into.  Holy shit.  What was this guy thinking? 
[02:18:00]  I guess he wasn't.  Oh, and the swine flu fucking fight?  Yeah.  That's a good story too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You've read that one?  Yes.  Okay.  We've got lots to do still.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Moving right along.  Let's not forget, Jim Norton's going to be at the Houston Improv starting tomorrow night.  Yes, tomorrow through Saturday.  And tomorrow we've got Bill Burr.  Bill Burr's going to be doing the show Thursday and Friday.  A lot of comics coming in in the next few days because, what, the New York Comedy Festival is happening? 
[02:18:30]  I wouldn't know I'm not a part of it.  Why aren't you a part of that, Jimmy?  That's pretty fucked up.  Because Jimmy's a little too blue.  Who's in charge of that?  Caroline's.  Right, I'm doing Caroline's in December.  So why wouldn't they have you part of the New York Comedy Festival?  I don't know, but I'm okay with it.  Also coming in tomorrow, Dane Cook and Bob Kelly.  Oh, great.  What?  Kelly coming in tomorrow?  Why?  Fucking Yankees had better win. 
[02:19:00]  I don't want to hear that motherfucker giving me shit.  Just look forward to game seven.  No, game seven.  Dane, too.  He's a fucking dirty Red Sox fan.  Yeah, but that's just it.  He's going to fucking be shitting all over me.  Hey, what about you Yankees?  Huh?  Yeah, you sit there.  You got your coffee.  You're watching the Yankees lose.  You're hanging out.  Boom.  The ball goes over the fence.  So when your Yankees win tonight, it'll be perfect.  Well, that'll be perfect.  It'll be perfect for the Bill Burr, Dane Cook, Bob Kelly trifecta tomorrow. 
[02:19:30]  All depends.  All Boston Red Sox fans, by the way.  All fucking Bill will just be like, man, he couldn't do it in five.  Shut up.  I suggest this.  If the Yankees don't clinch tonight, just take a sick day.  Yeah, I really should.  Look, I don't feel very well.  I'm going to feel so bad for you.  Bill Burr will just be relentless.  They all will just be horrid.  And no, I have the utmost confidence in the team. 
[02:20:00]  Yes.  And then Friday, we got Bill Burr again, which is good.  Doug Stanhope, which is very good.  Doug, I was just, what the fuck was I just thinking about, Doug?  He said something.  Oh, God.  Oh, when I woke up, there was some stupid fucking, those god-awful Girls Gone Wild commercials on.  And it just popped in my head, like, God, I remember Doug Stanhope did one of those ones.  He did?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember that.  He was like, and remember, he talked about it and said the guy that does it was a real prick.  And he goes, it just felt like a dirty fucking ass doing it. 
[02:20:30]  And he was pretty honest about it.  And Dr. Steve on Friday, too.  He's got a bit.  Dr. Steve.  I'm hearing rumblings that Dr. Steve has a bit.  Has a bit?  He's going to be doing a bit for us.  You know what?  I had a dream.  Get all this all popping in my head now, finally.  I had a dream last night that a nurse came up to me,  and she had a blood pressure thing and put it on my hard-on and started pumping it up.  And she was like, don't cum in it because I have to use it. 
[02:21:00]  What the fuck?  So she's pumping.  But she didn't know.  She goes, I don't know if this is going to hurt when I start getting the pressure on it.  And I go, well, just give it a couple of pumps and see.  And I was like, oh, wow, that's pretty good.  And she goes, all right, I'll pump it more, but I can't keep pumping it because I have to use it, so don't cum in it.  All right.  I don't know what it means.  We need someone that reads dreams to call immediately a dream apple or whatever.  Wait a minute.  What was that?  What was she saying?  She said at first she didn't know if it was going to hurt me. 
[02:21:30]  But I said, well, give it a couple of pumps.  You know, you wrap the fucking blood pressure thing around my hard-on.  I was already, you know, in my dream I had a boner.  And then she goes, okay, so she squeezed it once.  And I was like, oh, that's pretty good.  I go, keep going.  So she's squeezing a couple more times.  And then she told me not to cum in it because she has to use it.  I don't know if that's sexual or not or health-related.  It's a fucking.  It was my dick.  No, but it's a fucking. 
[02:22:00]  Look, the blood pressure thing tests blood pressure and heart and hard-on.  Sometimes it's fucking weird the way your mind.  Like they said, like, a lot of times if you dream about ice cream, it's ice cream.  It can be translated to, like, yes, phonetically broken down.  Not always.  This was purely like I wanted to fucking cum in her blood pressure sleeve.  That could be a pussy thing, too.  And I was very angry that she, like, had to stop.  I was like, fuck it.  You can wash it off.  Let me cum in your blood pressure cup.  Yeah, but listen. 
[02:22:30]  Ooh, the devil.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm saying sometimes it's not always as apparent as it seems.  Well, we've got to get someone that knows this shit, because that's a weird one.  Oh, I'm sure Lydia will be calling up any minute now.  Hi, Anthony.  What that means is that you want a heart monitor thing on your penis without ejaculating.  Right.  Thank you, Dumbella.  Why do you feel this way, Anthony?  No, I didn't cum in the bed.  I wish.  I love wet dreams.  I haven't had one in many, many years.  You bring up something that's pretty interesting, though.  Blood pressure fucking thing on your dick. 
[02:23:00]  Now, hmm.  I'm thinking it might kind of feel good.  I don't know, man.  When they take your blood pressure, it gets a little uncomfortable.  It's a little tight sometimes.  It gets a little tight.  Put the stethoscope on your balls.  Maybe you're afraid of getting a girl pregnant.  Maybe it's something like that.  Maybe that's a deep fear for you.  That would be, I'd be dreaming.  If that was me being afraid of getting a girl pregnant, I'd have that dream every night.  I'd be like, no!  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, let's go to Joe. 
[02:23:30]  That's a good one.  The dream analysts are starting to call here.  Joe, what do you got?  Good morning, boys.  Hi, sir.  Ant, how big is your dick that you're dreaming about it?  I dream about my own dick.  I'm looking to get a couple girls in my dreams.  You got your hog out there.  I was dreaming.  It was.  What is it?  Wow.  There's a picture.  Danny.  Is that Danny or Travis?  Travis.  Travis with a big win today.  Travis with a picture of a fucking blood pressure sleeve around a hard-on. 
[02:24:00]  There it is.  Someone's done it.  Now, you can't really think of anything that someone hasn't done already.  And that's kind of a natural.  You know, it might feel good.  I don't know.  It's like a tennis racket.  It's like a bump thing.  Kyle writes, don't leave us hanging.  Did you come or what?  No, I didn't.  I wish.  I was good.  I didn't come in her fucking thing.  She got to use it.  Sure, it was a her and it wasn't the fucking angel of death type fat nurse. 
[02:24:30]  It was some guy with a beard weighed 300 pounds.  He had a fucking pillow with handles on it.  Mongo the trucker is actually a dream analyst.  Mongo, what do you got on this?  Who knew that?  He really is, Jimmy.  This is what Creep Mongo does when he's fucking driving along a stretch of I-80 through fucking Iowa.  He thinks of dreams and what they mean as he gets fucking piles from driving all day.  I think Anthony is worried for his health because his hog is so big whenever it gets a heart on, his blood pressure just drops. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, maybe that's it.  Oh, shit.  No, it really was very sexual.  It was a very sexual dream.  Like, I wanted her to keep doing it and, you know, I wanted her to watch as I fucking shot all over her cuff.  Wait, this...  Her blood pressure cuff.  This guy's got it.  Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff.  Yeah, I think it's that you're looking for a younger pussy and you want it to be tighter as you keep going.  Oh, is that it?  The gauge shows the age. 
[02:25:30]  Is that what happens?  It starts pumping up and the gauge goes down in age as it gets tighter?  Oh, maybe.  Tom in Chicago.  Yeah.  Tom.  Hey, Ant, I think subliminally your body's telling you you're going to have a stroke.  Shut up, you fucking asshole.  Well, maybe...  Well, he means stroke, you know.  Oh, that I'm stroking my dick.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shut up.  No, the fucking age thing might be right because nurse, that's how...  If he dates a girl, that's how he wants her to feed.  He wants a young one. 
[02:26:00]  Abu.  Abu.  I want to nurse her.  We're the real dream analyst.  There was no real dream analyst.  That's a weird one.  That's a weird one.  They don't mean shit.  It means whatever the fuck is happening.  And then later on, I had a dream that me and my family were having a picnic in a warehouse,  but then we took a U-Haul in, had to unload all the furniture as like it was a house in  a warehouse.  And we sat around, had a picnic, and it got to be like five o'clock, and I was bummed because  we got to pack all the shit back in the U-Haul and drive out.  What does that mean?  Your dreams are exhausted. 
[02:26:30]  Mine are fucking terrible.  I didn't know what that meant.  Go to a, they have a million of these websites where you pop in your dream and they could  help you out a little bit.  It don't mean shit is what it means.  All right, let's see at least what the internet says.  No, I don't know about that.  Are dreams random or do your mind talk to you a little bit?  I don't think dreams mean anything.  I think they could be affected by what happens in your life.  Right.  But I don't think it's so out there and vague and weird.  I think it's, obviously, let's say you're stressed out for your job and you keep having this 
[02:27:00]  fucking dream that you're going to be fired.  Work dreams.  That, that thing.  I'll just call them work dreams.  Well, I used to have dreams when I first started in radio that, that the disc was fucking going  and the song was running out and I couldn't get to the fucking CD player in time.  We all had those.  I think, I think in general, dreams are just dreams.  Yeah.  Some maybe you could analyze.  Like, I mean, I have a good example of that.  Scott and, uh, Chattanooga.  Chattanooga!  Uh, Scott, listen to this dream.  You tell me this means something.  Maybe Jimmy will figure it out, though. 
[02:27:30]  Maybe he will.  Go ahead, Scott.  Hey, I had, uh, I had this dream where I was, there were lengths of shit about three  feet long and about the diameter of my wrist.  And I was taking the tapered ends and putting them together and making a huge chain.  You were making a shit chain?  Read that dream, Jimmy.  What does that mean?  It means that you have somebody and you're not too sure what to get them for Christmas.  So you figured you'd make your own charm bracelet out of duty.  Shit chain. 
[02:28:00]  It's either that or that's how you look at life.  It's just a big fucking, it's an unending fucking shitty experience.  Yeah, just a chain of shit.  Yeah, it goes round and round.  It never ends.  Links.  Yeah.  It never ended.  Thank you, Scott.  Is that real, by the way, or are you fucking around for the show?  No, that's real.  That's real.  Jesus, that's fucked up, man.  That's funny.  Thank you.  All right.  Uh, more people calling about, well, let's see.  I know about dreams.  Uh, let's go to Merrill.  Merrill?  Yes.  Hey, Merrill. 
[02:28:30]  Morning.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Hey, buddy.  Good.  How are you, man?  Good.  Um, about dreams, the three different stages of dreams, you know, there's three different  stages while you're dreaming.  Now, one of them is usually a dream about the past.  One is a dream about the future.  And the last one is usually a dream of, uh, fantasy.  So I would say that his dream about the, uh, arm pressure cuff is, uh, probably fantasy.  But the, uh, the one about the warehouse is probably a dream about his past and about 
[02:29:00]  the way he had to move.  Oh, like always moving with the family and stuff.  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, you never know.  Just when you were settled down, you had to move again.  And I was bummed that we had to like pack it.  I wasn't bummed that we had to pack everything and leave.  I was bummed that the work involved in packing everything.  Exactly.  Oh, did that suck?  Yeah, that's what I would say, you know, about the dreams.  So that, I think that one with the, uh, the arm pressure cuff, that might be, uh, something  you, you, you're subconsciously might want to do in the future.  Why, why would I have a fucking dream that we went into a warehouse for a picnic? 
[02:29:30]  Well, that one is your subconscious talking about your, your, uh, your past and you having  to move all the way up to California and all that.  Why a picnic?  Yeah, picnic.  Well, because of your childhood and, you know, your, your great relationship with your father.  I have certain sets.  Well, picnic represents family.  I mean, that's a family thing.  I have certain sets in my dreams too.  Like sets that I revisit every so often.  Can't you just, like there's a house, the Eagle's Nest. 
[02:30:00]  There's certain houses that are all in recurring dreams.  A certain road that I drive down a, a, a lake that's full of these like giant sea urchins  and giant like grouper fish.  And I have to, I have to get across it and the, the water's crystal clear and it's fucking  scary as shit.  Cause I'm looking right down the bottom, a giant fish and the boat I'm on is always ready  to tip over.  Whoa. 
[02:30:30]  Their dreams are exhausting.  It's crazy.  Let's fucking fall asleep.  Oh, I try to.  Jesus.  After analyzing that dream, I think you're just nuts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got no doubt about that.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  All right.  Well, this guy had a dream.  Uh, we want real dreams, not ones where you get on the air.  Yes.  Jim in Canada.  What do you got?  This is honestly, God.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Happy birthday, man.  Honestly, God, I'm straight as an arrow.  I got a dream last week that Michael Jackson sucked in my way. 
[02:31:00]  And I woke up.  Michael Jackson now?  Honestly, God, it was a fucking nightmare.  And I woke up and I just, Jesus Christ, I didn't know what to do, man.  And I still, it's the weirdest feeling in my life.  That's pretty fucked up.  What the fuck does that mean?  Can I read my tea leaves, Jimmy?  What's that, buddy?  Yeah, why?  Can I read my tea leaves?  Read your what?  Tea leaves, I think.  Jim, you're breaking up a little bit, unfortunately.  All right.  We'll get you next time.  Warehouse.  What does that mean there, Dan?  You're on a dream site? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, it says here for a warehouse.  To see a warehouse in your dream represents stored energy or hidden resources.  The warehouse also refers to memories.  Alternatively, you may also be putting your ambitions and goals on hold.  Was it an empty warehouse?  Well, there were like pipes in there and stuff.  And it was empty until we came in and unloaded the furniture.  Paul says to see an abandoned or empty warehouse indicates that your inner resources have been depleted.  You need to take some time off to restore your energy and replenish your resources. 
[02:32:00]  All right.  I'll be like Steve.  I need every Monday off.  Yes.  It says in my dreams they're telling me I need every Monday off.  It spoke to me.  It had a brain that was empty.  Yes.  Our dreams are telling us that we need five days off from Houston.  That's a long way to go.  I know.  Wow.  The empty warehouse.  Well, that's interesting.  What about...  Let me see if I can find a picnic. 
[02:32:30]  About a...  Yeah, picnic?  You got a picnic in there?  Let me see.  Let me see.  A picnic.  Whoa.  That's terrible.  Can't say that.  Whoa.  Well, that's something that was...  That was actually a derogatory term used out on Long Island for the Hispanic families  that would take...  That would get out of their car on the side of the parkways.  Because they're big grassy sides to the parkways.  And just open up a blanket and start eating.  And a hibachi and a barbecue.  I tell that same story.  People don't believe me. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, it happens all the time.  It happens more than...  Crazy.  More than I care to remember or whatever.  Yeah.  And they just pop their hood and make them believe their car's broke down.  Yeah, their car's busted.  And they're out there just eating.  Yeah, what the hell?  We gotta eat.  Little kids are running around with fucking diapers on and shit.  There's traffic doing 80 next to them.  I've seen them more than once.  It's the weirdest thing.  I don't get that.  Oh, picnic.  You got it.  You found it.  What's picnic all about?  Well, it says here, to dream that you're at a picnic signifies a joyful and tranquil domestic 
[02:33:30]  life.  Oh.  You prefer the simpler things in life.  Yes.  To see a picnic basket in your dream indicates an opportunity to learn and share your ideas  and opinions.  That's nonsense.  That sounds like nonsense, yeah.  But the first part, maybe.  Like, you know, kind of tranquil and nice.  Although, it was a warehouse.  Hey, this guy's got a great question.  Goddamn dream.  Oh, it's a girl.  Erin in Atlanta.  Erin.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  My new creedie.  I just wanted to discuss people that I always have in my dreams that I've never seen or met. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  I have no idea who the hell they are, where they come from, or if they even really exist.  I used to, like, fall in love with people in my dreams that I didn't know.  Like, I'd have sex with a girl in my dream and everything.  And then I'd be like, I'd wake up and go, oh, my God, I really liked her.  I know.  And you want to meet them.  This sucks.  And you're being a good crush, and you can never see them or have sex with them.  And then the image, like, the image of what they look like fades during the day, and you're  like, well, that person's gone. 
[02:34:30]  Who, yeah, who are these people, though?  The strangers in your dreams?  Yeah, who are they?  Your imagination is just...  Maybe it's just somebody you, like, as you're turning your head in a crowd on the streets,  you...  And your brain's registering it somehow?  Your brain just picks somebody out.  Yeah.  Or maybe just a random fucking Mr. Potato Head thing that's put together in your head of other  people's features.  That's a good question, Aaron.  I don't know.  Oh, we'll punch it out, guys.  All right.  Let's go over to...  We might have to do a dream show.  I like the dream show. 
[02:35:00]  Greg, Marilyn, what's up?  Greg?  Guys, and this is a serious dream.  I dreamed that I was a sweet potato in the middle of a basket of sweet potatoes.  That's...  And I have no idea what that means.  That means you fucking belong in Chelsea.  You're a flaming homosexual, sir.  You're a sweet potato, and you want to live amongst other sweet potatoes.  Who don't laugh at you when you walk a small dog and blow them behind dumpsters?  You're a voted sweetest potato.  I was a voter boy most likely to be mistaken for a yam. 
[02:35:30]  I don't know what that means.  Yes.  I love marshmallows.  All right, Greg.  Thank you.  All right.  Dream, I'm falling asleep driving?  Oh, yeah.  I've had that one.  Wow, really?  Oh, yeah.  Anytime I'm driving, I barely have control of the vehicle when I'm driving.  There have been times I've also been in the back seat of the car, and I'm supposedly driving  the car, and then I realize, like, oh, my God, I'm in the back seat. 
[02:36:00]  And you've got to get to the front seat, but it takes forever.  You're getting tangled up, and all sorts of shit is happening.  And there's another really creepy one that I have, and it's the same location.  I am taking off in a 747, not flying it, but I'm one of the passengers, and the cabin is  very open, and the seats aren't placed right.  You know, they're kind of odd.  And I can see out the windshield, the pilots, you know, the windshield.  And we're taking off on, like, a grass runway where the trees are, I swear, right at the 
[02:36:30]  wingtips.  And there's wires everywhere, and the plane, like, you feel the plane going up, and then  I feel it start dropping and going, uh-oh, we're fucking, you know, we're going down.  The plane's crashing.  I've had that type of dream, too.  Oh, that's a creepy-ass one.  That just sucks.  And it feels, like, so real.  Like, you feel that feeling in your stomach, like, it's going down.  All dreams feel real.  Yeah, some are weird, because sometimes I've been shot in dreams, and you don't feel anything. 
[02:37:00]  Right.  You're like, wow, I thought that would hurt a lot more.  When you're dreaming, for the most part, you're not sitting there going, oh, there's a dream.  Everything you're dreaming about, you're like, fuck.  Like those, though.  Fuck.  Helicopter crashes into my friend's house, and I haven't lived there in 15 years.  It's a dream that I beat Jimmy Norton in a donut-eating contest.  Hello.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I actually had a dream last night of little Jimmy Norton. 
[02:37:30]  I beat his ass in a chocolate-covered Intamin's donut-eating competition.  Oh.  I had a dream on my site that was very similar, that somebody was stealing all of my duty-filled  socks.  But, Jimmy, you were absolutely pissed at me.  Did I have a drawer full of socks with duty in them?  Duty-filled socks.  I have duty-filled socks, and I swing them and yell, hi-ho.  The funny part was that Norm MacDonald and Jay Moore were there egging you on to beat my 
[02:38:00]  ass because I beat you in this competition.  It was ridiculous.  Wow.  That's pretty weird.  Star-studded dream.  Yeah.  What do you think that means, little Jimmy?  No.  Um, I'm not sure.  You think you're funnier than Jim Norton?  Absolutely not.  I probably just could eat more donuts than that guy.  Probably.  I think that means, sir, that you wish to have a hat made of donuts.  That you could just take off and eat whatever you want to.  You want to have a donut hat. 
[02:38:30]  A big cruller.  Like, that's the bill of the cruller.  Yeah, cruller hat.  We wish to just get together and have a donut date.  What do you think, Jimmy?  I'd love to.  Be healthy.  God, this is Phone Topic Wednesday.  People love this.  Let's go to Leonard.  Leonard.  I gotta tell you, everyone's missing the fact that both of Anthony's dreams last night are  related to each other.  Okay.  First off, first off, if he has a cock so big that you can put a fucking blood pressure  cover on it, that means when he's done banging his girlfriend, her badge is the size of a 
[02:39:00]  warehouse you could have a picnic in.  That's funny.  Jesus Christ.  That's funny.  That's terrible.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, Leonard.  Right on.  Those are adjustable.  That's right.  Good call.  We're a horrible name.  Right.  If your name is Leonard, call yourself Lenny, because you sound like fucking De Niro from  Awakenings.  Hey, Leonard.  And there's another Leonard.  Leonard Lawrence.  Leonard Lawrence.  Only faggots and sailors are called Lawrence.  Who are you, Lawrence of Arabia? 
[02:39:30]  Only faggots and sailors are called Lawrence.  What an observation for Gunnery Sergeant Hartman to make.  Faggots and sailors.  Oh, that was a fucking funny line.  Let's go to James in Pennsylvania.  James.  Yes, Hope.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Better now, James.  Thanks.  Good.  Very good.  I grew up in New York, and I was having this recurring dream when I was in college about  this haunted house.  I was always trapped in the basement, and I was escaped from the storm doors.  I actually went around New Paltz where I went to school looking for this house. 
[02:40:00]  Never found it.  Never thought of the dream.  A couple years later, I moved to Pennsylvania.  I'm driving down one of the rural roads down here.  I actually passed the house.  I swear it was for my dreams.  To the point where I actually got out of the car and almost knocked on the door, but  then I realized it was probably a bad idea to visit the house that I was almost killed  into my dreams.  But the house exists, and I'd never seen it before.  It happened like five years after I stopped having this recurring dream, but it was every  night for several weeks.  It was creepy.  And that house exists. 
[02:40:30]  I passed it a couple times a week.  That's pretty fucked up.  No way.  Yeah, that's pretty fucked up.  How does your money...  I'm not a spiritual person.  I don't believe my dreams are telling me anything, which is to see that building standing on the  side of this country road with corn stalks all over the place.  It was very, very odd.  Recurring dreams are...  I have this recurring dream.  I don't know if it's a nightmare or not, but that I'm in front of a room full of people,  and they're expecting something from me, and I can't deliver it. 
[02:41:00]  And I don't know if it was a dream about not doing well on stage, but then one time I  dreamed farther.  I went farther with the dream, and I realized what they wanted from me was they wanted my  recipe for marmalade.  What a fucking dick. 
[02:41:30]  Fucking marmalade.  They wanted my famous marmalade recipe.  Do you have a name for your marmalade?  No.  No?  Okay.  I'll give you a minute.  I'm sure you'll come up with a name for your marmalade.  After the break, you'll have a name for your marmalade, right, Jimmy?  Jimmy loves hats and marmalade.  Who doesn't?  That's my dream.  It's my nightmare.  It's a snail slithering through a hat full of marmalade.  A hat full of marmalade. 
[02:42:00]  Is there anything worse than orange marmalade?  I don't think there is.  At the fucking diner?  Yes.  Why are they still making this shit?  No one eats it.  I'll tell you what's worse than orange marmalade.  Donkey shit spread.  It comes in a peanut butter-like jar, and it's pure, softened donkey shit, and you spread  it on Melba toast, and you fucking suck it off a bullcock.  That's worse than orange marmalade, but not much worse.  Well, you answered my question.  Thank you.  Donkey shit spread on Melba toast, sucked off a bullcock, beats orange marmalade by a smidge. 
[02:42:30]  Holy shit.  In the worst department.  I run on all fours like a dog in my dream.  You want that one?  Yes.  Let's go to Matt.  Matt.  Yes.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey.  Hi, Matt.  Hey, yeah, this is a recurring dream novel, and I've had it for as long as I can remember.  I'm just running on all fours like a dog, just running and running.  And then I wake up, and I feel tired.  I don't know.  How is it to run on all fours, though? 
[02:43:00]  That seems like it would be pretty cool.  It seems cool in the dream.  I mean, I don't know how I could ever do it in real life, but it makes sense in the dream.  Did you ever dream that you called a radio show and came to the conclusion that you were an asshole?  He's just trying to share.  I'm just kidding.  Thank you, Matt.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Fuck him.  All right.  Yeah, Mike.  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Hey.  I had a dream.  I was driving to my motorcycle test in Plainfield, and I got shot in the forehead. 
[02:43:30]  I woke up the next morning.  It was actually a zit right now.  It's the same place I got shot.  What the fuck is that about?  A zit on your head.  Probably felt it growing under there.  Yeah.  And dreamt about it.  You know what?  I felt it when I was...  You could actually feel it when I was shot in the dream.  I felt like I ran into a wall.  All right.  Just like this call.  All right.  Trucker dreams that he's driving in his sleep and wakes to freak out while trucks move around 
[02:44:00]  him.  James in the Poconos.  I think he's doing this one for the show.  Are you doing this one for the show, James?  No, absolutely not.  But I keep...  I want to see if Jimmy knows what this dream means.  Probably.  I hope so.  I keep fucking my 15-year-old neighbor, and her mom keeps getting mad at me.  I just want to see if Jimmy knew what that means.  It means you're Anthony.  That's true.  That's a fucking tip.  That's pretty obvious.  You want to fuck your 15-year-old neighbor, and you're afraid of the consequence. 
[02:44:30]  That's nice.  You know?  Why does his mom get mad at you?  He's gone.  Let's see how to eat it.  No one caught my little joke there, I guess.  I said, why does his mom get mad at you?  He's like, he's a peter pumper.  Damn suck dicks!  I bet you could suck marmalade through a golf hose.  A garden hose.  Oh my God.  A golf hose.  I'm tired.  I'm getting punchy. 
[02:45:00]  Where are we?  Ethan in PA.  Ethan.  Yes.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What's up?  I've been having a dream for years and years now, actually.  I'm in a fight, and I can't land a punch.  I mean, I can swing, but my fists are stopping just short.  Yeah, I hate those.  I've had those, too.  It's like when you can't run in a dream, or you have a gun, but the ammo doesn't fucking  fit in the clip, and shit like that.  So you're swinging, and you can't land a punch, and you're getting hit? 
[02:45:30]  Well, I don't know if I'm getting hit or not, but it's just like, I'm swinging, and  the swings are going just as fast as they're supposed to, but they're just stopping short.  The running dream is bad, too, when you're trying to run, and you just can't.  So fucking frustrating.  You're fucking like, oh my God.  You're almost crawling, like trying to fucking run.  You can't do that.  I've also, I was reading Steve from Base Shore's dream thing reminding me.  I have this one, too, where you travel back in time. 
[02:46:00]  Like, I'll be like, holy shit, it's, I go, it's not fucking like 2009, it's like 1960-something,  and I'll start telling people what's going to happen.  I'll be like, oh, you are going to freak out at this, that, the other thing, and then  I wake up, but it's like telling people the future.  That's better than watching a movie.  It's pretty cool.  I have some fun dreams, but.  My dream's boring.  And most of them action-packed, like crime, and gunfire, and chases, and car chases. 
[02:46:30]  That's because you keep the TV on, simple as that.  It probably is, and I always have it on, like, those crime show channels.  I mean, a lot of us, you dream whatever was the last show you were watching just before  you turned the TV off.  Yeah, you could, if you're hearing something.  All of a sudden, you make that connection, and you're dreaming that, that shit.  Beth might have a real, real interpretation, Ant.  She dreams her boyfriend plays with a band and never comes home.  He's with the boys.  Hi, guys.  Good morning.  Why would you want to be with the boys when you could be with Beth?  I know. 
[02:47:00]  You know, she might have gotten fat.  Ah, true.  Not yet.  They can't find the sound.  Yeah, they can't find the sound.  It's coming out of the fucking ass, stupid.  That's a good song.  Oh, stop it.  Come on.  It's not.  I want to interview Peter Criss.  Do you?  Yeah, man.  He fucking beat breast cancer.  Men don't get that that often.  Not that often.  That's true.  Why would you ever want to talk about beating breast cancer if you're a man?  With a kiss.  Well, it's.  That's a rough one.  I know.  I wonder if it's more embarrassing than other cancers, or do you just not give a fuck?  Once they say cancer, you don't care what they call it.  Really? 
[02:47:30]  Cares.  Oh, that's a good question.  Beth?  A lot of questions.  All right, Beth.  You heard Ant's dreams.  What do you got on that?  My thought is that he's feeling very confined, and some authority figures are telling him  not to do things he desperately needs to do.  Hmm.  Think that out.  Like society.  So silent.  And certain age of consent laws.  Yeah, stupid.  That's society and their dumb rules.  Why would you interpret it like that?  Give me your, you know, how you worked that out. 
[02:48:00]  Just a different perspective, because you keep going, like, to the obvious, and dreams  usually aren't that obvious.  Yeah, but how did you come up with that from that?  Like, I could have said, I could have come up with anything.  Like, you could have just made something up.  Why would you think my dream meant that?  Well, because you've been complaining a little about your bosses and your inability to do  what you used to do on air. 
[02:48:30]  That's true.  Even when you were on N.E.W., you seemed to have more freedom than you have now on  satellite.  Oh, let me just quickly bring that up.  I was driving home yesterday, listening to the fucking replay, and it was from N.E.W.  Was it the porn music bit?  Dude, yes.  And we started bitching, because someone came in and said, guys, just want to let you know  they're dumping out of a lot of this bit.  And we freaked out, like, oh my god!  How dare you?  And as I'm listening to the bit, I'm like, how the fuck were we saying any of this? 
[02:49:00]  Any of it?  Yeah, maybe Ant doesn't like restrictions or bosses.  No one likes restrictions.  But I mean, maybe that's what he's dreaming about, though.  But how would that be interpreted into a fucking blood pressure cuff around my cock and me  picnicking in the White House?  Hold on, pressure?  It's fine.  You're being...  But the blood pressure...  But it felt good.  I wanted them to keep going.  Right, but you weren't allowed to do what you wanted.  Because?  I just wanted to come.  Who doesn't?  You weren't allowed to.  But you can't. 
[02:49:30]  They're telling you not to.  You can't.  Legally, you can't.  That's right.  I think it's obvious to all of us.  You can't come on a fucking blood pressure cuff?  Well, the tightness represents something else, if you know what I mean.  Oh, a little restriction on pleasure?  Legally, you're not allowed to do that.  A restriction on pleasure.  And you used to enjoy your job a lot.  I still love it.  I don't like getting up in the morning.  But I like everything else with the job.  It's fun.  Lately, we're loving this again.  I like the job.  And it shows.  We'll go back to hating this in a few months. 
[02:50:00]  A few minutes.  That's a fucking roller coaster.  Thank you, Beth.  My pleasure.  That's not bad.  She's got a pretty good angle on it.  I don't know.  She never really gave me a good...  Whatever.  It's just...  You know what?  It's just as good as any other fucking explanation.  Danny's got a website up that he feels confident about because he hasn't moved from that website  in a while.  But it's scary.  Well, because it's creepy.  And it's been popping up on some of those sites I frequent lately.  It's called thisman.org.  And apparently, a lot of people across the world have been dreaming of the same guy. 
[02:50:30]  And they sketch him out.  And they're all similar sketches.  It's this guy right here.  Oh, Jesus.  And it's creepy.  A handsome gentleman.  Yeah.  And here's some portraits that people have made.  Oh, other people have...  Yeah, like hundreds of people have dreamt about this guy.  It's a big unibrow guy.  That's like the common denominator with kind of a roundish face.  I've dreamt about that guy.  Yeah.  Let me see his face.  Have you?  Yes, I have.  No way.  Yes, I have.  When?  I dreamt that...  When I was having difficulties with my marmalade distributor, 
[02:51:00]  he was the man who was in charge of the marmalade warehouse.  And he was dropping them like jars of honey with tumor's feet.  He was dropping my marmalade jars.  That guy's a tool.  I hate that guy.  All right, what is this about?  I don't think I've ever dreamt about him, though.  I don't know whether it's real or not.  If I ever dreamt about this guy, I'd be freaked out.  Well, now we're all going to dream about him because we're looking at his fucking face.  That is true.  Now you're looking at it. 
[02:51:30]  What theories?  Well, there's a few.  Where he just looks like a bald prick.  Yeah.  And everyone just kind of sees him and goes, yeah, me too.  Some people say that it's an image belonging to the collective unconscious.  Oh, unconscious.  That could surface in times of hardship.  Some people think that it's the creator.  It's the form in which God manifests himself today.  Oh, what not?  First of all, how would you just dream about somebody and go, huh,  where can I find a bunch of other people who have dreamt of a pedophile-looking guy?  Yeah, that guy stinks. 
[02:52:00]  That doesn't...  Well, the story goes, there's a patient in a psychiatrist's office drew the face of a man  that they'd been repeatedly dreaming about.  The picture got left on the guy's desk.  Another patient came in and said, oh, I've been dreaming about that guy.  Did you go to fucking Snopes on this?  Not yet.  It's garbage.  This is kind of new.  I don't know if it might have been on Snopes.  Yeah, that's true.  I know who that guy is.  Kind of creepy.  He's from the Midwest.  His name is Marv Herbert.  Good old Marv Herbert.  Marv Herbert.  He sells shoe leather out of the back of his fucking...  His Vega. 
[02:52:30]  That's what Marv Herbert does.  His Chevy Vega.  Yeah, he has a Chevy Vega and he sells shoe leather.  Tongues only.  Have you seen this man?  Forums.  I'm going to go to this one.  This guy's pretty serious about his dream.  John in Connecticut.  John.  Hey.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, John.  How you doing?  Hey.  Good, man.  Your dream.  Yeah.  My boy was killed in Iraq back in 2006. 
[02:53:00]  First of all, we're sorry.  Sorry.  23 years old he was.  He was killed.  About three months after his death, I started getting these dreams of him.  And basically, it seems like he was saying goodbye to me.  Come in.  My dream was like I was home and he'd walk into the room and he'd be in uniform.  He'd sit down and talk to me. 
[02:53:30]  And there's been, you know, a few times this has happened.  Maybe four or five times since he died.  That's pretty creepy.  One time he had spoken to me about the day he died.  Another time he had told me that he was okay and didn't want me to worry and that he was  in a better place.  God makes me feel like he's okay. 
[02:54:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  He's just fine.  And you believe it, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Talk about him all the time, you know.  My wife.  Tell him how, you know, he's come to visit.  Yeah, it's kind of cool.  I get a little visit from dead people every so often.  I get the dad dreams every so often.  Every so often, I'll be in California.  I'll be riding a horse.  And then my father will be there.  And, you know, he's been dead since like 95 or something like that. 
[02:54:30]  And then you talk to him.  And then you wake up and you're like, oh, that was cool.  I had a little visit.  My dad's death was unexpected.  And I had a dream sort of similar to what John's talking about where my dad like hugged me in this dream.  And I swear to this day, it was fucking real in some way.  It was so fucking bizarre.  Like, I was so aware.  Remember how we were talking about how you're aware of your dreams?  I'm like, that's crazy.  But in this case, I was aware that, wow, this was way more than a fucking dream. 
[02:55:00]  Really?  Even though I was, you know, out cold asleep.  Yeah, I had a dream.  And it was so creepy.  Because I've had other dreams with people that I've known that have died and they're in my dreams.  It wasn't, there was something physical about it.  Really?  Sir, does your wife get the dreams too?  Sir?  No, actually, she hasn't.  She feels as if, you know, at least one of us is.  She'll ask me in the morning how my night was, you know. 
[02:55:30]  We joke about it sometimes.  Because we seem to seek comfort to knowing that there's definitely something out there, you know.  Right.  So he was killed, I'm sorry, he was killed how long ago?  2006.  Oh, three years ago.  Okay.  It was a very publicized thing.  He was killed along with nine other Marines.  What was it, a helicopter crash?  No.  It was an ambush outside of Nazarea on March 26th. 
[02:56:00]  Jesus.  And it was very well publicized.  Now, how do they let you know?  Do they actually come to the door like we see in the movies, or do they call you, or is it, how do you find out?  Oh, they come to the door.  They do.  It's a very, very personal thing.  But I'll tell you, when you get a peek outside, you see the vehicle, you already know.  So when you heard that bell ring, you kind of looked out the window and saw that it was a military vehicle? 
[02:56:30]  I had just happened to peek out the window, and I saw the vehicle out there.  Jesus.  And I went outside, and I met them at the back door.  Yes.  My wife already, she already lost it.  She knew.  No shit.  Jesus Christ.  Are you military yourself, or ex-military?  I'm retired.  Oh, you are?  Okay.  Wow.  I served during the first Gulf War.  Were you in the Marine Corps, too? 
[02:57:00]  Yes, sir.  I mean, do you, when something like that happens, do you feel like, oh, I should have told him,  not to go, or do you feel like that that was, it was a decision that he wanted to make,  and that he made, and that you're cool with that?  It was his decision to make.  I'm cool with that.  I have come to terms with the fact that he was killed.  Regardless, he served his country, and he died.  Regardless of my feelings, my political feelings are relevant. 
[02:57:30]  He answered the calling.  And he paid with him for his life.  Wow.  Damn, man.  Was he, uh...  It was the same thing I was willing to do when I signed up during the first Gulf War.  Yeah.  Even though we didn't see nowhere near as much as what these boys are seeing now.  Right.  It was still the thought was in my mind.  I knew what I was doing when I was listed.  I knew...  Uh-oh.  We're losing John. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, damn.  Your phone just cut off.  Damn, what a great call.  John?  We lost him.  Yeah, he's a bisel cadet.  Well, thanks for calling, man.  I had such a real dream about my dad once, uh, that I actually smelled the spaghetti sliding  down the wall, uh, when he threw it.  There's good old Ed.  Ah!  Ah!  What?  What?  Uncomfortable with the real moment.  Uncomfortable with the real moment.  Get back to the comedy.  Ah, please.  Get back to the comedy.  I can't take this.  I can't take it.  It's so sad.  Good old Ed. 
[02:58:30]  It's so sad.  It's terrible.  The vehicle pulling up.  Oh, my God.  That is just horrific.  Well, John, thanks for sharing.  We should take a break.  I wonder if that was his only...  I was going to ask if that was his only, like, kid that he has in the military or does  he have other kids?  Yeah, there's a few questions we want to ask him.  I want to ask him if it gets easier.  No, I'm sure he thinks about it all the time.  Or what does it become three years later?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  I'm not saying it's easy by any means, but what does it become?  I think when you lose... 
[02:59:00]  I'm guessing when you lose a kid, it's different than losing a parent because it's against nature  to outlive your children.  You're supposed to die before your kid.  I'm as bummed as I was about my dad's death.  He was 74 and had horrendous heart issues, but he ends up dying in a car accident.  That's different than losing a kid unexpected.  Yeah, especially to somebody else.  Like in a war, even though you understand why they're there and it's, you know, it's  something that, you know, it's a military.  It's still, you know, that somebody else has done that.  Right.  As opposed to just an accident. 
[02:59:30]  That was an uplifting call.  Can we go back to jerking off exotic animals?  Yeah.  Yeah, we can.  No, that was, you know, that was a good...  That's a real moment, man.  Yeah.  That's some real shit right there.  All right, guys.  When we return, I will have a name.  For the marmalade?  Yeah.  I've been tossing a few around and I've just put the kibosh on hullabalooze. 
[03:00:00]  Thank goodness.  No one would buy that.  Hullabalooze marmalade.  Could you pick me up some hullabalooze marmalade when you're at the store?  I wouldn't say it like that.  It'd be so popular.  They'd say, let me have some hullabalooze blueberry or a little hullabalooze orange.  Oh, you wouldn't even have to say marmalade because you'd just know.  Everybody would like hullabalooze.  No, they wouldn't.  Some info on that website, by the way.  Somebody did some research.  Yeah.  I think I'm looking at the same thing right now.  Is it true?  What?  That it was registered by a marketing company in Italy? 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  Like a viral marketing company.  Yeah, it's garbage.  Why did you make pee pee?  Well, think about it.  It's a great idea because now anyone that went to that site and saw that face will see that  face in their dreams.  Plus, you could print out flyers to ask if you've seen that man, you know, put him all  around town.  All right.  I mean, true or not, it's creepy.  Good to know there's not...  It's a good story.  Some voodoo out there.  Who fucking registered as the marketing name instead of a guy?  They probably didn't think people would look.  I don't know.  Well, you know what it is? 
[03:01:00]  It's the guy's name, but then the email address that's listed, if you go to that domain, you  see that it's a marketing sign.  What a dick.  Hey, Steven S. from Bayshore wants to guess your marmalade name.  Okay.  He wants to know if it's fruit, F-R-O-O-O-T, mulp.  Fruit mulp?  M-U-L-P.  Fruit mulp.  Fruit mulp.  It's not bad, but...  Is mulp even a word?  Because that's a great word.  Hey, you mulp.  Steve is an ass. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Even though you made me laugh there, Steven, no Islander game for you.  Oh.  I decided not to take you.  Sorry.  Tough shit.  I've tried...  I've thought of different ones.  Save the names for after the break.  I'll just tell you what I thought of, but I'm going to scratch it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Marmectomy.  I didn't think it would be very popular.  No.  Oh, no.  Will you show two pieces of fruit, one's gone?  Oh, shit.  I want to know about dreaming about your dead relatives. 
[03:02:00]  It's just dreaming.  There's no way you're going to know.  It's things you wish you could say or things you wish you could hear, I'm sure.  I don't even know.  You know what?  Mine would never be profound or anything.  It's just like hanging out stuff like, hey, what's up?  How you doing?  Maybe you wish you could.  No, no.  You're just like, eh.  But yours was based on like a memory you had.  You rode horses when you're dead.  Yeah, but it was more than a memory because it was new.  It was a new thing.  It wasn't something we had done.  Like, it was new, and I knew that he was dead.  Because it was like, what the fuck is he doing here? 
[03:02:30]  And then you wake up and just go, oh, cool.  I got to visit.  And it's fake.  You know, I know it's fake.  It's not real.  But it's better than, you know, an animatronic Disney dad going, hello, how are you today?  You know, a dream that kind of seems real.  Didn't make you feel good.  When it's happening.  Oh, yeah.  They're pretty cool like that.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Sierra Mountains drinking champagne.  Champagne cocktail.  You know what, dude?  Dreams are basically just your mind telling you stuff, dude.  It's a bunch of bullshit. 
[03:03:00]  I don't even listen to it, dude.  Do you think it means something, though?  I'm running out of gas, Bob.  I got to make wee-wee.  All right, let's do that.  Opie and Anthony.  John called back.  Hey, John.  John in Connecticut.  Hopefully on a landline.  Father of the killed son that brought a few people to tears right before the break.  Soldier in Iraq, yeah.  Including Crisco in Chicago. 
[03:03:30]  John, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Well, you got everyone crying today, my brother.  I'm sorry.  It's all good.  I just wanted to say to you guys, too, that I've been a fan for you guys for quite a while.  My son used to listen to you.  And that's pretty much when I started, when he died.  Because I knew that he loved you guys.  Talked about you all the time.  Jeez.  Hey, where do you lean politically? 
[03:04:00]  Where do I lean?  Yeah.  Anywhere that allows me to keep my weapons.  I love it.  That'd be to the right.  Very good, my friend.  And, John, I was wondering, because none of us in this room obviously know.  I mean, does it become something else?  Like, your son's been gone three years.  Or is it just as brutal as the first day you found out?  That's kind of a tough thing to break down.  But as far as the initial pain, the numbness that you feel, yeah, that death mark gets easier. 
[03:04:30]  Missing him?  No, it doesn't.  Yeah, of course not.  Right.  I miss him every day I think about him.  He's always on my mind.  But we come from a long line of veterans, combat veterans, my family. 
[03:05:00]  We all pretty much served at one point or another.  Some of us dying in battle and others not.  My conflict was nowhere near.  Like Lieutenant Dan.  Mine was nowhere near as bad.  Other parts of my family can't say the same thing.  Right.  John, do you have other kids?  No.  He was my old.  He was my old.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, that really sucks.  Was he married at all?  Did he have children?  No, he didn't.  No.  He was saving it for after.  He had a girl, but he wasn't going to marry her until after he got back.  Plain and simple, he said to her that, because I have no idea what's going to happen.  He said, but I don't want to make you a widow.  Jesus.  Do you guys still keep in touch with her at all, or is it just too hard for everybody? 
[03:06:00]  Oh, no.  Every year we see her.  She has, you know, she's gone up.  I believe she's still in college right now.  But, uh...  How do you feel about those savages over there that took your son?  Well, I think I want to keep that one to myself. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  I want to keep that one to myself.  I hear you.  All right, man.  I wish he would have gone to Afghanistan, but that was my own personal opinion.  Yeah.  But the fact that he was called, you know, he was doing what he was trained to do, I backed  him up 100%.  You know, it's just a thing you've got to do, you know?  I hear these, uh... 
[03:07:00]  Bleeding heart fucking liberals.  Excuse my French, but...  That's not French.  That's a good curse word.  Good American one.  No, it makes me sick sometimes.  Yeah.  What makes you sick that they say?  Like, what's the biggest thing that they do that just really fucking gets to you?  Oh, I'm glad your son's dead.  What?  Who said that?  Fucking assholes.  Who actually said that? 
[03:07:30]  I had a confrontation with Westboro Baptist Church.  Oh, the...  That's a good one.  They're not liberals, though.  I saw a documentary on them.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Let me...  Let me...  I'm kind of jumping ahead of myself.  Okay.  I'm not stating that they're liberals here.  It's just that these are some of the things that I've heard, you know?  Oh, okay.  From liberals, it's just one of the things that happened, and I don't know. 
[03:08:00]  Now, wait, did they come and protest your son's funeral?  Oh, no, they didn't trust me.  They're glad they didn't, because I would have been blazing away.  Where did you confront...  Because they really are, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, they're the most hateable group of people in the country.  They really are.  Absolutely.  Where did...  They're reprehensible fucking individuals.  Where did they...  I listen to you.  I love you guys.  I've been listening to you guys for a long time.  Jimmy, you're awesome.  Thank you. 
[03:08:30]  I missed your show up in Manchester, but...  I...  You have the funny bone, I believe it was.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  At Harvard.  At Harvard.  Yeah, I missed the show, but...  I really wanted to see you.  Um, my, uh...  Oh, yeah, I don't know what to say.  Your show is not the only show that I listen to.  I listen to Ron and Ron and Pez.  Right.  Uh, I really kind of freak out when he has that woman on there, you know?  Yeah.  Uh, I understand his point and I, and the method to his madness. 
[03:09:00]  Uh, but it really, uh, I end up having to turn the channel, you know?  It just...  Well, Ronnie's able with her, though.  The thing I like about it, and I wish that we would be able to do this, but we couldn't,  our emotions would get the best of us, is he finds her as repugnant as everybody else  does, but to just...  It's almost like to allow her to be her, you can really see what unabashed just assholes  those people are.  It's really easy to get mad at them, but when you allow them just to speak and allow them 
[03:09:30]  just to say what they want to say, you really can let them just kind of...  But he's got a personal friggin', you know...  Oh, of course.  I'm saying why I would find it entertaining, is they're just such pigs, and the more they  talk, the more you realize, like, wow, they really are as disgusting as people think they  are.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So where did you have a confrontation with one of them?  Uh, me and some of my boys, uh, went to a soldier's funeral in Washington.  Oh. 
[03:10:00]  And, uh, we were helping with the Patriot Guard.  We, well, we're not, I'm not part of the Patriot Guard, but, uh, we tried to, to make it to  the funerals as many as we can, uh, to pay our respects, and we had a confrontation with,  uh, Westboro.  Ugh.  And who said that to you?  I confronted one of them, and when I had mentioned that my son had died, she pretty much just 
[03:10:30]  looked me dead in the eye and said, oh, I'm glad your son's dead.  Did you knock her fucking teeth out?  Uh, the image went through my brain.  I mean, what's that, there's that show there, I forget what it was, where the guy just imagines  and blowing his wife's brains out.  Yeah.  But how do you hold, John, how do you hold back?  Like, how do you hold back after someone says that?  Ugh.  Hmm.  Go to jail.  You have to think of the contributions.  No, I, I understand, yeah, it's just, that's, wow. 
[03:11:00]  They're all lawyers, they'd sue you, you'd lose your house, it's not worth it.  Right, right.  I, I, I can't, I can't tell you, I, I just, uh, I figured that if there was a day, a day  came that I found out that maybe I was dying of terminal cancer, you know.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah, I believe, I believe in that stuff.  Then the gloves are off, you know.  Yep, yep.  I look at it like this, I'm going to see my boy one day, and, uh, you know, he'll, he'll  be, uh, he'll be standing there in his uniform and, uh, ready to greet me when my time 
[03:11:30]  comes.  I just, I just wish that I'd never, I never, would have had to bury him, you know.  Just never thought that, I always thought that my boy was going to be the one to bury  me, but.  Yeah, they, they say that that's obviously much harder, just the way nature works, you  know, it's like, as people, or any creature, you're supposed to kind of die before your  offspring, like, you know, to, to be creature-ish about it, you know.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Hey, you know, you know, guys, I, I know the crowd, and I, I love the crowd, they're a bunch  of ruthless people sometimes, uh, and I know how they can get, I'm going to let you guys 
[03:12:00]  go so you can get on with the show and start talking about jerking up animals.  Fucking A, John.  We'll give that a whirl.  John, you're a whirl.  Well, we are going to get, we're going to get Jim Norton's orange, uh, marmalade name.  Yeah, that was the big teaser.  Everyone's just been waiting for that, boy, let me tell you.  Yeah, boy, marmalade now.  I want to see how Jim segs into the orange marmalade bit.  But that, that, John, thanks for calling, man.  Yeah, right on, John.  We appreciate your call.  All right.  Love you guys.  Thanks for listening, man.  Thanks for, uh, sharing with us today, John.  Yeah, all right, there it goes, John. 
[03:12:30]  Fuck.  Yeah, it's something I'm going to deal with.  Those Westboro people, you know, you have to be careful the way you say things on the  air.  Yeah.  But watching that documentary on them and knowing that they, to me, they're just a bunch  of inflammatory children.  Like, they're saying things just to upset people.  Like, they're not really trying to get any message across.  But you really wish, let's just see, I wish that somebody would do something.  Yeah, it's, it's, it's just a natural thing.  When someone is that repugnant, you wish horrible things upon them. 
[03:13:00]  Like, you hear about stories of certain incidents happening in certain places, and you just wish  that it would happen involving those people.  Like, like, like, here's a prime example.  When you heard Jeffrey Dahmer was beaten to death in prison, did you think, oh, that poor  man?  Or were you like, fucking A, good, he got exactly what he deserved.  He, that would be the feeling I would get if I heard news that something awful had happened  to those people.  I wouldn't have any sympathy.  I'd be like, good, good.  None whatsoever. 
[03:13:30]  Good.  They got what they deserved.  That's, that's, you know.  Yeah, they truly are.  I think they're just a truly repulsive group of people.  Yeah.  God, to show restraint.  I mean, I would fucking knock that lady's teeth right through her, man.  And again, the difference between somebody who has some discipline and can, can look  at a situation and realize the consequences, and somebody who, you know, lets the emotions  get away from them, and it winds up being worse for that person, so.  The cops want to fucking, protect them.  The cops have to protect them. 
[03:14:00]  I know.  The cops probably want to shoot them.  They can't, to protect them.  Cops are like, why can't we just have Nazis march here?  Why do these repugnant people have to show up?  And I understand, you know, he did what he had to do.  Yeah.  I'm one of those guys, and fortunately, the emotion gets the best of me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't know how he was able to, you know.  I don't really know how I, I hold back in that situation.  A kicker right in the fucking big fat cunt.  Oh, would that be nice?  Whack.  Hear a thwack.  Jesus.  Your foot, your foot pulls out of it, and it sounds like a boot coming out of wet mud. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, they really are despicable fucking people.  Jim, you want to try the orange marmalade name?  I like my bouncy seat.  Oh, that's kind of cute.  It's like I'm riding a horse.  Yes.  Well, that, uh, now that that's, now that that's over.  It's an unfortunate, I mean, I know John didn't mean to throw me for a loop, but the story  kind of wrecked my marmalade name, which was going to be called, um, Westboro Marmalade, 
[03:15:00]  praise his name.  Praise his name.  Westboro Marmalade.  Westboro Marmalade.  Jesus.  There's a show on, um, I think I got on Apple TV, where, uh, it's about, there's a documentary  on them, and, uh, they're not dumb.  Like, some of them are smart.  Like, you're not arguing with dummies, and that's the typical thing, is you think because  they're religious zealots or they're pigs, that they're dumb, but they're not stupid. 
[03:15:30]  They're all lawyers.  So they know how to defend their points, and, you know, they're, they're really enraging  people.  They're ruthless.  They're fucking ruthless with their tactic.  And I don't know what their end game is.  Like, what's their end game?  They're, are they, they're not quite a, a cult that actually believes this shit.  So what's the end game?  Is it financial?  Is it, is it just to annoy people?  Is it attention?  Personally, I think it's, uh, I think Fred Phelps was the guy that started it.  Uh, one of his kids said in a voicemail, like one, I think four of them have left, like 
[03:16:00]  four of his children have left.  One of them said that apparently he was very abusive and extremely violent.  That was what the kids said.  That makes perfect sense, by the way.  So it's almost like these guys, if, if what that child said is true, they were raised in  that environment.  And to me, it's all about making daddy happy, even though they now believe it, of course.  Gotcha.  But to me, it's all about pleasing daddy and living in daddy's world and doing his daddy  It's very cult-like then.  It really is, yes.  It's very cult-like and, uh.  To me, it's very weak and just, you know, to be that scared and convince yourself that 
[03:16:30]  you're not scared, but you believe in what daddy believes is just silly.  How does somebody, like, like these, these people, how do they walk around though and  not have been assaulted or, or worse?  Uh, it, it amazes me the restraint of people.  Yeah.  Like, how, how do they walk around without somebody that's been personally affected by  them, um, taking out some type of vengeance, their anger, uh, frustration, whatever it 
[03:17:00]  might be, um, on them physically.  I'm sorry.  I wonder though, do they go, like, were they here for like the Halloween parade or the  gay pride parade yelling faggots, die faggots of AIDS?  Were they here during gay pride?  Like, I imagine if they did it here in New York, in the village.  Yeah, that'd be a problem.  They probably, first of all, they might not be able to, I think they always get permits.  Yeah.  But they might not be able to get a permit here.  Um, but do they, or do they go into black neighborhoods and it's not, for them, it's not about race, but do 
[03:17:30]  they go into black neighborhoods and just protest dead black soldiers and say, we're glad you're  dead, you know, they, they, they, they find safe fucking areas, safe situations.  Do they go into like fucking Brownsville or look, I mean, look, there's soldiers that come  out of Compton, there's fucking, there's dead black kids going back home to Compton, their  families have to bury them.  Do they go out there to fucking South Central Los Angeles and stand with those God loves 
[03:18:00]  dead soldiers, God laughs?  I don't think so.  Do they, do they stand there?  It's like, why don't they do that?  I mean, if you're going to protest it and try to humiliate the families of dead soldiers,  why don't you do it in those neighborhoods too?  Or do they?  I don't know.  Let's go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  I, uh, I live near Rutgers and Westboro just came to Rutgers for a protest outside the Jewish  groups there.  And there was a huge, huge counter protest, like thousand kids.  And they were all warned ahead of time to not touch these 15 Westboro protesters because 
[03:18:30]  they fund their entire travels, all of their trips by solely through lawsuits that they  have after people have physical altercations with them.  It makes sense.  People just probably settle.  Um, what were they protesting at Rutgers?  Why the Jewish center?  They were protesting against rabbis.  Apparently that they, they were there for some conference in New Jersey.  They decided to stop by because Rutgers has one of the biggest Jewish populations of any 
[03:19:00]  university.  So they're outside like the Jewish Hillel center and they were protesting the gay rights groups.  And it was funny to see kind of the coalition against them.  You had like fraternities and like Orthodox Jews and the gay and lesbian community all out  there.  There were like over a thousand kids protesting them, but they all had to be warned.  You do not touch these guys.  You stay away because if you touch them, then they win as much, not if you touch them. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  But if you rip them from limb, they lose.  You know, that's a good point.  They probably want to get hit.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I say if a mob though, if a mob was just to overtake them.  Well, yeah.  Unfortunately, it'd be a crazy situation, but a one-on-one confrontation, I'm sure that's  a, that's exactly what they want.  Now that I think about it.  Hmm.  They, uh, God, they're just fucking, it's, it's, well, when they say things like we love  when dead soldiers come home, it's like, to me, they're, they're just trying to get  attention.  It's like the sincerity of their message.  If they stood out there with signs and just protested and said, uh, God has put aides 
[03:20:00]  here to kill homosexuals.  If they use certain language, a lot of people who don't like gays would agree with them.  But because they're saying God hates fags, it's like that's schoolyard taunting shit.  But yeah, you can't really expect your message to be taken seriously.  Well, they had signs, they had signs that said rabbis raped.  I mean, it's just childlike.  It's like they're looking for attention.  They want to make daddy pleased.  It's like baby as shit.  Little babies.  Uh, Adam, thank you. 
[03:20:30]  I got to move on because there's a few more, uh, people that have had confrontations with  these guys.  It's Jay in Columbia.  Jay.  Hey guys.  First time, long time.  Hang on, bro.  I'm real.  Uh, yeah.  I missed my chance probably just about 10 years ago.  Uh, they've been in my hometown, uh, a couple of times and they were protesting at our  university and they were standing on the corner, the intersection of the two biggest streets  in town.  And there's a giant puddle of water and I was in a pickup truck and I, like going through  my mind, I was like drifting over towards this puddle because I just wanted to douche  the entire thing. 
[03:21:00]  Hey, easy fella.  With that behavior, I thought he was going to say like, run them over.  Splashing with a puddle would be fun.  It went through my head and I thought, yeah, I'm going to be the one that ends up in prison  for these idiots.  Do you know what was funny?  It was a guy, um, during the documentary, some obnoxious guy was rickrolling them.  He was standing there with a fucking boombox.  See if Danny, maybe you can find that online.  He's got a boombox on his shoulder and he's just fucking dancing and rickrolling while they're  protesting.  It's like, it's all you can do is just stand there and be silly and obnoxious and they 
[03:21:30]  really do hate that.  Or yell at Shirley, uh, uh, what's her name?  Shirley Phelps?  Phelps.  About her, uh, the fact that she, uh, I believe she had a child out of wedlock and that's something  that stops that bitch in her tracks.  She don't like that.  Yeah.  Can you put this up a little bit?  Oh, this is the Rick Roll song.  He's got a spiked hair.  He's got a mohawk spiked hair.  And he's a sign that says, you got a rickroll.  Fag shirts, they have a sign. 
[03:22:00]  And he's there, rickrolling them.  And he's dancing.  He's dancing and rickrolling them.  They turn their backs to him.  And then he goes around.  The guy is rickrolling them.  This guy is great.  You got rickroll.  You got rickroll.  That's fucking hilarious.  That's a good tactic against them.  Because if you sit there face to face yelling at them, that's something they're used to. 
[03:22:30]  They come back with their fucking bullshit.  Uh, so to rickroll them is hysterical.  I personally think that anybody who protests them should find out which one of her kids  was had out of wedlock and hold up pictures of that kid and hold up pictures of her.  And I would harp on that.  Going to hell and dying.  Just look, just the fact that I'm sure certain people would think that only a  pig or a whore has a kid out of wedlock.  And I think that's the message that should be drilled home.  Uh, because you have to catch, find out stuff like that that's real and that you can't, 
[03:23:00]  you know, that you, uh, can't be taken to task for, quote unquote.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe.  He tasks me and I shall have you.  Hey boys, what's up?  Hey Joe.  Hey, I was, uh, I was a Marine on Camp Lejeune and, uh, I don't know if you remember, there  was that Marine woman who was raped by another Marine and he fled to Mexico or something.  And they were having her funeral, uh, on the, in North Carolina in Camp Lejeune.  And, uh, we, you know, they caught wind that the Westboro Baptist Church was going to be 
[03:23:30]  by the Marine Corps base protesting her funeral.  And, uh, you know, this is North Carolina where everyone has a gun and every, all they do  is drink beer and shit.  They, they literally had to have us, uh, sit down with our COs and they were literally  pleading with us not to go and just F these people up.  Right.  You know, just ridiculous.  As much as they are, I mean, I can't, we all know how reprehensible they are.  The good thing about them is they show you that like, that's one thing about our country 
[03:24:00]  that's unfortunately, that's the price we pay for having free speech is that pigs like  that are allowed to say what they want to say.  Um, and it's like, that is, that is the price we pay for free speech.  It's like, they have to be allowed to do it.  Um, even though they're just despicable people.  It's just such a kick in the balls because half of us lost friends over there.  Oh, dude.  And then we see them with their fucking IED signs and all that shit.  Please, every soldier, I can imagine what every soldier wants to turn around and do  what every American would love you to do in that situation. 
[03:24:30]  But you can't, and it's, if, if, if all of a sudden people started killing them or attacking  them completely, it really would hurt us as a country because there's always going to  be people who are saying shit that we find despicable.  Like, uh, as much of a visceral reaction as we have to that, there are people that feel  that strongly against gays and gay marriage.  So then they would start attacking pro-gate protesters or shooting them.  It's like, you just can't do it.  You understand?  You know what I mean?  It's like, you guys have more restraint than I do, though.  That's why, that's why I don't own a firearm. 
[03:25:00]  I don't trust myself.  You know, and I guess in a sense, if we were to do that, we're kind of proving the point  that, you know, Marines are hotheads and scumbags, but, you know, whatever.  Well, Marines are hotheads.  I don't think that's a stretch.  I don't think you have to be anti-Marine to say they're fucking hotheads.  It's a tough spot for you guys to be in.  Good point, Jimmy.  Amazing.  Thank you, Joe.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Love it.  All right.  Jimmy, Houston Improv.  Yes, sir.  Tomorrow night.  I'll be here tomorrow, but I leave at 9.30.  It's tomorrow night through Saturday, and my Leno has been moved to next week, so I may  have to cancel Virginia, Richmond. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, shit.  If I do, I apologize, but I may be doing a panel.  It's just, the whole schedule gets juggled.  I hear you.  All right.  Oh, I forgot.  But I keep forgetting to plug Chick-A-P-E.  Chick-A-P-E.  It's the night after Thanksgiving.  Two nights after, I'm in Boston, but Chick-A-P-E.  Oh, what's the name of the place in Chick-A-P-E?  I don't know.  The Hooky Lao, it might be.  It's an awful name.  Yeah, it's a horrid name.  It's an awful name. 
[03:26:00]  Assholes in cunt town would be a more dignified name than fucking the Chick-A-P-E Hooky Lao,  but I think that's where it is.  I'm doing a couple of shows.  Steve from Bayshore said, is Jimmy pre-canceling Bayshore?  Are you pre-canceling your gig?  No, Bayshore is still on.  Thank God.  You better keep that date.  I want to do it.  They're sold out to you.  I like that money.  All right, guys.  We're done.  Tomorrow, Bill Burr, Dane Cook, and Bob Kelly.  Dane canceled, by the way.  Can't wait.  No, he didn't.  I just said that. 
[03:26:30]  Some people would look forward to it.  Stop, you.  There's a lot of outrage out there because he did Howard today.  That's okay.  What's the outrage?  The guy's plugging him.  Howard plays that game.  We don't play that game.  Yeah, he's plugging a Madison Square Garden gig.  He also did the Today Show.  We understand when, you know, guys have to do both shows.  We just understand how it works.  Howard never understood that.  That's his battle.  We want Reggie.  That's his inner battle that he fights every fucking day.  All right, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Thanks for listening.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. 
[03:27:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye. </pre>
